<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN every narrative, whether hi&s;torical
or biographical, authenticity is of the
utmo&s;t con&s;equence. Of this I have ever
been &s;o firmly per&s;uaded, that I in&s;cribed
a former work to that per&s;on who was
the be&s;t judge of its truth. I need not
tell you I mean General Paoli; who,
after his great, though un&s;ucce&s;sful,
efforts to pre&s;erve the liberties of his
country, has found an honourable a&s;ylum
in Britain, where he has now lived many
years the object of Royal regard and pri|vate
re&s;pect; and whom I cannot name
without expre&s;&s;ing my very grateful &s;en&s;e
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
of the uniform kindne&s;s which he has
been plea&s;ed to &s;hew me.</P>
<P>The friends of Dr. John&s;on can be&s;t
judge, from internal evidence, whether
the numerous conver&s;ations which form
the mo&s;t valuable part of the en&s;uing
pages, are correctly related. To them
therefore I wi&s;h to appeal, for the accu|racy
of the portrait here exhibited to the
world.</P>
<P>As one of tho&s;e who were intimately
acquainted with him, you have a title to
this addre&s;s. You have obligingly taken
the trouble to peru&s;e the original ma|nu&s;cript
of this Tour, and can vouch for
the &s;trict fidelity of the pre&s;ent publica|tion.
Your literary alliance with our
much-lamented friend, in con&s;equence of
having undertaken to render one of his
labours more complete, by your edition
of Shak&s;peare, a work which I am confi|dent
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
will not di&s;appoint the expectations
of the publick, gives you another claim.
But I have a &s;till more powerful induce|ment
to prefix your name to this volume,
as it gives me an opportunity of letting
the world know that I enjoy the honour
and happine&s;s of your friend&s;hip; and of
thus publickly te&s;tifying the &s;incere
regard with which I am,</P>

<HEAD>THE
JOURNAL
OF A
TOUR TO THE HEBRIDES,
WITH
SAMUEL JOHNSON, L. L. D.</HEAD>
<P>DR. JOHNSON has for many years given
me hopes that we &s;hould go together,
and vi&s;it the Hebrides. Martin's Account of
tho&s;e i&s;lands had impre&s;&s;ed us with a notion
that we might there contemplate a &s;y&s;tem of
life almo&s;t totally different from what we had
been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee, and, to find &s;implicity
and wildne&s;s, and all the circum&s;tances of re|mote
time or place, &s;o near to our native great
i&s;land, was an object within the reach of rea&s;on|able
curio&s;ity. Dr. John&s;on has &s;aid in his
journey, &startq;that he &s;carcely remembered how the
wi&s;h to vi&s;it the Hebrides was excited;&endq; but
he told me, in &s;ummer 1763, that his father
put Martin's Account into his hands when he
<PB N="2" REF="8">
was very young, and that he was much plea&s;ed
with it. We reckoned there would be &s;ome
inconveniencies and hard&s;hips, and perhaps a
little danger; but the&s;e we were per&s;uaded
were magnified in the imagination of every
body. When I was at Ferney, in 1764, I men|tioned
our de&s;ign to <HI>Voltaire.</HI> He looked at
me, as if I had talked of going to the North
Pole, and &s;aid, &startq;You do not in&s;i&s;t on my ac|companying
you?&endq;&mdash;&startq;No, Sir.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Then I
am very willing you &s;hould go.&endq; I was not
afraid that our curious expedition would be
prevented by &s;uch apprehen&s;ions; but I
doubted that it would not be po&s;&s;ible to pre|vail
on Dr. John&s;on to relinqui&s;h, for &s;ome
time, the felicity of a London life, which, to a
man who can enjoy it with full intellectual re|li&s;h,
is apt to make exi&s;tence in any narrower
&s;phere &s;eem in&s;ipid or irk&s;ome. I doubted that
he would not be willing to come down from
his elevated &s;tate of philo&s;ophical dignity;
from a &s;uperiority of wi&s;dom among&s;t the wi&s;e,
and of learning among&s;t the learned; and from
fla&s;hing his wit upon minds bright enough to
reflect it.</P>
<P>He had di&s;appointed my expectations &s;o long,
that I began to de&s;pair; but in &s;pring, 1773,
he talked of coming to Scotland that year with
&s;o much firmne&s;s, that I hoped he was at la&s;t in
earne&s;t. I knew that, if he were once launched
<PB N="3" REF="9">
from the metropolis, he would go forward very
well; and I got our common friends there to
a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;etting him afloat. To Mrs. <HI>Thrale</HI> in
particular, who&s;e enchantment over him &s;eldom
failed, I was much obliged. It was, &startq;<HI>I'll give
thee a wind.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Thou art kind.</HI>&endq;&mdash;To <HI>attract</HI>
him, we had invitations from the chiefs <HI>Mac|donald</HI>
and <HI>Macleod;</HI> and for additional aid, I
wrote to Lord <HI>Elibank,</HI> Dr. <HI>William Robert&s;on,</HI>
and Dr. <HI>Beattie.</HI></P>
<P>To Dr. <HI>Robert&s;on,</HI> &s;o far as my letter con|cerned
the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, I wrote as fol|lows:</P>
<P>&startq;OUR friend, Mr. <HI>Samuel John&s;on,</HI> is in great
health and &s;pirits; and, I do think, has a &s;e|rious
re&s;olution to vi&s;it Scotland this year.
The more attraction, however, the better;
and therefore, though I know he will be
happy to meet you there, it will forward the
&s;cheme, if, in your an&s;wer to this, your expre&s;s
your&s;elf concerning it with that power of
which you are &s;o happily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which
may be &s;o directed as to operate &s;trongly
upon him.&endq;</P>
<P>His an&s;wer to that part of my letter was quite
as I could have wi&s;hed. It was written with
the addre&s;s and per&s;ua&s;ion of the hi&s;torian of
America.</P>
<P>&startq;WHEN I &s;aw you la&s;t, you gave us &s;ome
hopes that you might prevail with Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="10">
to make out that excur&s;ion to Scotland, with
the expectation of which we have long flat|tered
our&s;elves. If he could order matters
&s;o, as to pa&s;s &s;ome time in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> about
the clo&s;e of the &s;ummer &s;e&s;&s;ion, and then
vi&s;it &s;ome of the Highland &s;cenes, I am con|fident
he would be plea&s;ed with the grand
features of nature in many parts of this
country: he will meet with many per&s;ons
here who re&s;pect him, and &s;ome whom I am
per&s;uaded he will think not unworthy of his
e&s;teem. I wi&s;h he would make the experi|ment.
He &s;ometimes cracks his jokes upon
us; but he will find that we can di&s;tingui&s;h
between the &s;tabs of malevolence, and <HI>the
rebukes of the righteous, which are like excellent
oil,</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Our friend <HI>Edmund Burke,</HI> who by this time had received &s;ome pretty &s;ore rubs from Dr. John&s;on, on account of the unhappy difference in their politics, upon my repeating this pa&s;&s;age to him, exclaimed, &startq;Oil of Vitriol!&endq;</NOTE>, <HI>and break not the head.</HI> Offer my be&s;t
compliments to him, and a&s;&s;ure him that I
&s;hall be happy to have the &s;atisfaction of &s;ee|ing
him under my roof.&endq;</P>
<P>To Dr. <HI>Beattie</HI> I wrote, &startq;The chief inten|tion
of this letter is to inform you, that I
now &s;eriou&s;ly believe Mr. <HI>Samuel John&s;on</HI> will
vi&s;it <HI>Scotland</HI> this year: but I wi&s;h that every
power of attraction may be employed to &s;e|cure
our having &s;o valuable an acqui&s;ition,
<PB N="5" REF="11">
and therefore I hope you will, without delay,
write to me what I know you think, that I
may read it to the mighty &s;age, with proper
empha&s;is, before I leave London, which I
mu&s;t do &s;oon. He talks of you with the
&s;ame warmth that he did la&s;t year. We are
to &s;ee as much of <HI>Scotland</HI> as we can, in the
months of Augu&s;t and September. We &s;hall
not be long of being at <HI>Mari&s;chal College</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This I find is a Scottici&s;m. I &s;hould have &s;aid, &startq;It will not be long before we &s;hall be at <HI>Mari&s;chal</HI> College.&endq;</NOTE> He
is particularly de&s;irous of &s;eeing &s;ome of the
We&s;tern I&s;lands.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Beattie did better: <HI>ip&s;e venit.</HI> He was,
however, &s;o polite as to wave his privilege of
<HI>nil mihi re&s;cribas,</HI> and wrote as follows:</P>
<P>&startq;YOUR very kind and agreeable favour of
the 20th of April overtook me here ye&s;terday,
after having gone to Aberdeen, which place
I left about a week ago. I am to &s;et out
this day for London, and hope to have the
honour of paying my re&s;pects to Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI>
and you, about a week or ten days hence. I
&s;hall then do what I can, to enforce the to|pick
you mention; but at pre&s;ent I cannot
enter upon it, as I am in a very great hurry;
for I intend to begin my journey within an
hour or two.&endq;</P>
<P>He was as good as his word, and threw &s;ome
plea&s;ing motives into the northern &s;cale. But,
indeed, Mr. John&s;on loved all that he heard,
<PB N="6" REF="12">
from one whom he tells us, in his Lives of the
Poets, <HI>Gray</HI> found &startq;a poet, a philo&s;opher, and
a good man.&endq;</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Elibank</HI> did not an&s;wer my letter to
his lord&s;hip for &s;ome time. The rea&s;on will
appear, when we come to the i&s;le of <HI>Sky.</HI> I &s;hall
then in&s;ert my letter, with letters from his
lord&s;hip, both to my&s;elf and Mr. <HI>John&s;on.</HI> I
beg to be under&s;tood, that I in&s;ert my own
letters, as I relate my own &s;ayings, rather as
keys to what is valuable belonging to others,
than for their own &s;ake.</P>
<P>Luckily Mr. Ju&s;tice (now Sir <HI>Robert) Chambers,</HI>
who was about to &s;ail for the Ea&s;t-Indies, was
going to take leave of his relations at <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>
and he conducted Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> to that town.
Mr. <HI>Scott,</HI> of <HI>Univer&s;ity College, Oxford</HI> (now
Dr. <HI>Scott,</HI> of the Commons) accompanied him
from thence to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> With &s;uch propi|tious
convoys did he proceed to my native
city. But, le&s;t metaphor &s;hould make it be
&s;uppo&s;ed he actually went by &s;ea, I choo&s;e to
mention that he travelled in po&s;t-chai&s;es, of
which the rapid motion was one of his mo&s;t
favourite amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Samuel John&s;on's</HI> character, religious,
moral, political, and literary, nay his figure
and manner, are, I believe, more generally
known than tho&s;e of almo&s;t any man; yet it
may not be &s;uperfluous here to attempt a &s;ketch
of him. Let my readers then remember that
<PB N="7" REF="13">
he was a &s;incere and zealous chri&s;tian, of high-church
of England and monarchical principles,
which he would not tamely &s;uffer to be que&s;|tioned;
&s;teady and inflexible in maintaining
the obligations of piety and virtue, both from
a regard to the order of &s;ociety, and from a
veneration for the Great Source of all order;
correct, nay &s;tern in his ta&s;te; hard to plea&s;e,
and ea&s;ily offended; impetuous and irritable in
his temper; but of a mo&s;t humane and benevo|lent
heart; having a mind &s;tored with a va&s;t and
various collection of learning and knowledge,
which he communicated with peculiar per&s;pi|cuity
and force, in rich and choice expre&s;&s;ion.
He united a mo&s;t logical head with a mo&s;t fer|tile
imagination, which gave him an extraordi|nary
advantage in arguing; for he could rea&s;on
clo&s;e or wide, as he &s;aw be&s;t for the moment.
He could, when he cho&s;e it, be the greate&s;t
&s;ophi&s;t that ever wielded a weapon in the &s;chools
of declamation; but he indulged this only in
conver&s;ation, for he owned he &s;ometimes talked
for victory. He was too con&s;cientious to make
errour permanent and pernicious, by deliberate|ly
writing it. He was con&s;cious of his &s;uperio|rity.
He loved prai&s;e when it was brought to
him; but was too proud to &s;eek for it. He
was &s;omewhat &s;u&s;ceptible of flattery. His
mind was &s;o full of imagery, that he might
have been perpetually a poet. It has been often
<PB N="8" REF="14">
remarked, that in his poetical pieces, which it
is to be regretted are &s;o few, becau&s;e &s;o excel|lent,
his &s;tyle is ea&s;ier than in his pro&s;e. There
is deception in this: it is not ea&s;ier, but
better &s;uited to the dignity of ver&s;e; as one
may dance with grace, who&s;e motions, in or|dinary
walking&mdash;in the common &s;tep, are auk|ward.
He had a con&s;titutional melancholy,
the clouds of which drakened the brightne&s;s of
his fancy, and gave a gloomy ca&s;t to his whole
cour&s;e of thinking: yet, though grave and
aweful in his deportment, when he thought it
nece&s;&s;ary or proper, he frequently indulged
him&s;elf in plea&s;antry and &s;portive &s;allies. He
was prone to &s;uper&s;tition, but not to credulity.
Though his imagination might incline him
to a beliet of the marvellous, and the
my&s;terious, his vigorous rea&s;on examined the
evidence with jealou&s;y. He had a loud voice,
and a &s;low deliberate utterance, which no doubt
gave &s;ome additional weight to the &s;terling
metal of his conver&s;ation. Lord <HI>Pembroke</HI> &s;aid
once to me at <HI>Wilton,</HI> with a happy plea&s;antry,
and &s;ome truth, that &startq;Dr. <HI>John&s;on's</HI> &s;ayings
would not appear &s;o extraordinary were it
not for his <HI>bow-wow way:</HI>&endq; but I admit the
truth of this only on &s;ome occa&s;ions. The
<HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> played upon the <HI>Canterbury organ,</HI> is
more &s;ublime than when played upon an infe|rior
in&s;trument: but very &s;light mu&s;ic will
<PB N="9" REF="15">
&s;eem grand, when conveyed to the ear through
that maje&s;tic medium. <HI>While therefore Doctor
John&s;on's &s;ayings are read, let his manner be taken
along.</HI> Let it however be ob&s;erved, that
the &s;ayings them&s;elves are generally great;
that, though he might be an ordinary compo&s;er
at times, he was for the mo&s;t part a <HI>Handel.</HI> His
per&s;on was large, robu&s;t, I may &s;ay approaching
to the gigantic, and grown unwieldy from cor|pulency.
His countenance was naturally of
the ca&s;t of an ancient &s;tatue, but &s;omewhat di&s;|figured
by the &s;cars of that <HI>evil,</HI> which, it was
formerly imagined, the <HI>royal touch</HI> could cure.
He was now in his &s;ixty-fourth year: he was
become a little dull of hearing. His &s;ight had
always been &s;omewhat weak; yet, &s;o much does
mind govern, and even &s;upply the deficiency
of organs, that his perceptions were uncom|monly
quick and accurate. His head, and
&s;ometimes al&s;o his body, &s;hook with a kind
of motion like the effect of a pal&s;y: he was fre|quently
di&s;turbed by cramps, or convul&s;ive
contractions, of the nature of that di&s;temper
called <HI>St. Vitus's</HI> dance. He wore a full &s;uit of
plain brown clothes, with twi&s;ted hair buttons
of the &s;ame colour, a large bu&s;hy greyi&s;h wig,
a plain &s;hirt, black wor&s;ted &s;tockings, and &s;ilver
buckles. Upon this tour, when journeying,
he wore boots, and a very wide brown cloth
great coat, with pockets which might have al|mo&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="16">
held the two volumes of his folio dictionary;
and he carried in his hand a large Engli&s;h oak
&s;tick. Let me not be cen&s;ured for mentioning
&s;uch minute particulars. Every thing relative
to &s;o great a man is worth ob&s;erving. I re|member
Dr. <HI>Adam Smith,</HI> in his rhetorical lec|tures
at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> told us he was glad to know
that <HI>Milton</HI> wore latchets in his &s;hoes, in&s;tead of
buckles. When I mention the oak &s;tick, it is
but letting <HI>Hercules</HI> have his club; and, by-and-by,
my readers will find this &s;tick will bud,
and produce a good joke.</P>
<P>This imperfect &s;ketch of &startq;the COMBINATION
and the <HI>form</HI>&endq; of that Wonderful Man, whom I
venerated and loved while in this world, and
after whom I gaze with humble hope, now that
it has plea&s;ed ALMIGHTY GOD to call him to a
better world, will &s;erve to introduce to the
fancy of my readers the capital object of the
following journal, in the cour&s;e of which I tru&s;t
they will attain to a con&s;iderable degree of ac|quaintance
with him.</P>
<P>His prejudice again&s;t <HI>Scotland</HI> was announced
almo&s;t as &s;oon as he began to appear in the
world of letters. In his <HI>London,</HI> a poem, are
the following nervous lines:</P>
<Q><L>For who would leave, unbrib'd, <HI>Hibernia</HI>'s land?</L>
<L>Or change the rocks of <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Strand?</L>
<L>There none are &s;wept by &s;udden fate away;</L>
<L>But all, whom hunger &s;pares, with age decay.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="11" REF="17">
The truth is, like the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> and
<HI>Romans,</HI> he allowed him&s;elf to look upon all
nations but his own as barbarians: not only
<HI>Hibernia,</HI> but <HI>Spain, Italy,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> are at|tacked
in the &s;ame poem. If he was particularly
prejudiced again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> it was becau&s;e they
were more in his way; becau&s;e he thought their
&s;ucce&s;s in <HI>England</HI> rather exceeded the due pro|portion
of their real merit; and becau&s;e he
could not but &s;ee in them that nationality which
I &s;hould think no liberal minded Scot&s;man will
deny. He was indeed, if I may be allowed the
phra&s;e, at bottom much of a <HI>John Bull;</HI> much of
a blunt <HI>true-born Engli&s;hman.</HI> There was a
&s;tratum of common clay under the rock of
marble. He was voraciou&s;ly fond of good eat|ing;
and he had a great deal of that quality
called <HI>humour,</HI> which gives an oiline&s;s and a
glo&s;s to every other quality.</P>
<P>I am, I flatter my&s;elf, compleatly a citizen of
the world.&mdash;In my travels through Holland,
Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Cor&s;ica, France,
I never felt my&s;elf from home; and I &s;incerely
love &startq;every kindred and tongue, and people
and nation.&endq; I &s;ub&s;cribe to what my late
truly learned and philo&s;ophical friend
<HI>Cro&s;bie</HI> &s;aid, that the Engli&s;h are better ani|mals
than the Scots; they are nearer the &s;un;
their blood is richer, and more mellow: but
when I humour any of them in an outrageous
<PB N="12" REF="18">
contempt of Scotland, I fairly own I treat them
as children. And thus I have, at &s;ome mo|ments,
found my&s;elf obliged to treat even
Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P>To <HI>Scotland</HI> however he ventured; and he re|turned
from it in great good humour, with his
prejudices much le&s;&s;ened, and with very grate|ful
feelings of the ho&s;pitality with which he was
treated; as is evident from that admirable
work, his &startq;Journey to the We&s;tern I&s;lands of
Scotland,&endq; which, to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment,
has been mi&s;apprehended, even to rancour, by
many of my countrymen.</P>
<P>To have the company of <HI>Chambers</HI> and <HI>Scott,</HI>
he delayed his journey &s;o long, that the court of
&s;e&s;&s;ion, which ri&s;es on the eleventh of Augu&s;t,
was broke up before he got to Edinburgh.</P>
<P>On Saturday the fourteenth of Augu&s;t, 1773,
late in the evening, I received a note from him,
that he was arrived at <HI>Boyd's</HI> inn, at the head
of the <HI>Canongate.</HI> I went to him directly. He
embraced me cordially; and I exulted in the
thought, that I now had him actually in <HI>Cale|donia,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Scott's</HI> amiable manners, and at|tachment
to our <HI>Socrates,</HI> at once united me to
him. He told me that, before I came in, the
doctor had unluckily had a bad &s;pecimen of
<HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> cleanline&s;s. He then drank no fer|mented
liquor. He a&s;ked to have his lemonade
made &s;weeter; upon which the waiter, with his
<PB N="13" REF="19">
grea&s;y fingers, lifted a lump of fugar, and put
it into it. The doctor, in indignation, threw
it out of the window. <HI>Scott</HI> &s;aid, he was afraid
he would have knocked the waiter down. Mr.
<HI>John&s;on</HI> told me, that &s;uch another trick was
played him at the hou&s;e of a lady in <HI>Paris.</HI> He
was to do me the honour to lodge under my
roof. I regretted &s;incerely that I had not al&s;o
a room for Mr. <HI>Scott.</HI> Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> and I
walked arm-in-arm up the High-&s;treet, to my
hou&s;e in <HI>James's court:</HI> it was a du&s;ky night: I
could not prevent his being a&s;&s;ailed by the even|ing
effluvia of Edinburgh. I heard a late ba|ronet,
of &s;ome di&s;tinction in the political world
in the beginning of the pre&s;ent reign, ob&s;erve,
that &startq;walking the &s;treets of Edinburgh at
night was pretty perilous, and a good deal
odoriferous.&endq; The peril is much abated, by
the care which the magi&s;trates have taken to
enforce the city laws again&s;t throwing foul
water from the windows; but, from the &s;truc|ture
of the hou&s;es in the old town, which con|&s;i&s;t
of many &s;tories, in each of which a different
family lives, and there being no covered &s;ewers,
the odour &s;till continues. A zealous Scot&s;man
would have wi&s;hed Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> to be without
one of his five &s;en&s;es upon this occa&s;ion. As
we marched &s;lowly along, he grumbled in my
ear, &startq;I &s;mell you in the dark!&endq; But he ac|knowledged
that the breadth of the &s;treet, and
<PB N="14" REF="20">
the loftine&s;s of the buildings on each &s;ide, made
a noble appearance.</P>
<P>My wife had tea ready for him, which it is
well known he delighted to drink at all hours,
particularly when &s;itting up late, and of which
his able defence again&s;t Mr. <HI>Jonas Hanway</HI>
&s;hould have obtained him a magnificent reward
from the Ea&s;t-India Company. He &s;hewed
much complacency, upon finding that the
mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e was &s;o attentive to his &s;in|gular
habit; and as no man could be more po|lite
when he cho&s;e to be &s;o, his addre&s;s to her
was mo&s;t courteous and engaging; and his
conver&s;ation &s;oon charmed her into a forgetful|ne&s;s
of his external appearance.</P>
<P>I did not begin to keep a regular full journal
till &s;ome days after we had &s;et out from Edin|burgh;
but I have luckily pre&s;erved a good
many fragments of his <HI>Memorabilia</HI> from his
very fir&s;t evening in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>We had, a little before this, had a trial for
murder, in which the judges had allowed the
lap&s;e of twenty years &s;ince its commi&s;&s;ion as a
plea in bar, in conformity with the doctrine of
pre&s;cription in the <HI>civil</HI> law, which <HI>Scotland</HI> and
&s;everal other countries in <HI>Europe</HI> have adopted.
He at fir&s;t di&s;approved of this; but then he
thought there was &s;omething in it, if there had
been for twenty years a neglect to pro&s;ecute a
crime which was <HI>known.</HI> He would not allow
<PB N="15" REF="21">
that a murder, by not being <HI>di&s;covered</HI> for twenty
years, &s;hould e&s;cape puni&s;hment, We talked
of the ancient trial by duel. He did not think
it &s;o ab&s;urd as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed; &startq;For
(&s;aid he) it was only allowed when the que&s;|tion
was <HI>in equilibrio,</HI> as when one affirmed
and another denied; and they had a notion
that Providence would interfere in favour of
him who was in the right. But as it was
found that in a duel, he who was in the right
had not a better chance than he who was in
the wrong, therefore &s;ociety in&s;tituted the
pre&s;ent mode of trial, and gave the advantage
to him who is in the right.&endq;</P>
<P>We &s;at till near two in the morning, having
chatted a good while after my wife left us. She
had in&s;i&s;ted, that to &s;hew all re&s;pect to the Sage,
&s;he would give up our own bed-chamber to
him and take a wor&s;e. This I cannot but
gratefully mention, as one of a thou&s;and obli|gations
which I owe her, &s;ince the great obli|gation
of her being plea&s;ed to accept of me as

<P>Mr. Scott came to breakfa&s;t, at which I in|troduced
to Dr. John&s;on, and him, my friend
Sir <HI>William Forbes,</HI> now of <HI>Pit&s;ligo;</HI> a man of
whom too much good cannot be &s;aid, who,
with di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, and application in
<PB N="16" REF="22">
his profe&s;&s;ion of a Banker, is at once a good
companion, and a good chri&s;tian; which I
think is &s;aying enough. Yet it is but ju&s;tice
to record, that once, when he was in a danger|ous
illne&s;s, he was watched with the anxious
apprehen&s;ion of a general calamity; day and
night his hou&s;e was be&s;et with affectionate in|quiries;
and, upon his recovery, <HI>Te Deum</HI> was
the univer&s;al chorus from the <HI>hearts</HI> of his
countrymen.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on was plea&s;ed with my daughter
<HI>Veronica,</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The &s;aint's name of <HI>Veronica</HI> was introduced into our family through my great grandmother <HI>Veronica,</HI> Counte&s;s of <HI>Kincardine,</HI> a Dutch lady of the noble hou&s;e of <HI>Sommel&s;dyck,</HI> of which there is a full account in <HI>Bayle's</HI> Dictionary. The family had once a princely right in <HI>Surinam.</HI> The governour of that i&s;land was appointed by the States General, the town of Am&s;terdam, and Sommel&s;dyck. The States General have acquired Sommel&s;dyck's right; but the family has &s;till great dignity and opulence, and by intermarriages is connected with many other noble families. When I was at the <HI>Hague,</HI> I was received with all the affection of kindred. The pre&s;ent <HI>Som|mel&s;dyck</HI> has an important charge in the Republick, and is as worthy a man as lives. He has honoured me with his cor|re&s;pondence for the&s;e twenty years.

She had the appearance of li&s;tening to him.
<PB N="17" REF="23">
His motions &s;eemed to her to be intended for
her amu&s;ement; and when he &s;topped, &s;he
fluttered and made a little infantine noi&s;e, and
a kind of &s;ignal for him to begin again. She
would be held clo&s;e to him; which was a proof,
from &s;imple nature, that his figure was not
horrid. Her fondne&s;s for him endeared her
&s;till more to me, and I declared &s;he &s;hould have
five hundred pounds of additional fortune.</P>
<P>We talked of the practice of the law. Sir
William Forbes &s;aid, he thought an hone&s;t
lawyer &s;hould never undertake a cau&s;e which
he was &s;atisfied was not a ju&s;t one. &startq;Sir (&s;aid
Mr. John&s;on) a lawyer has no bu&s;ine&s;s with the
ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of the cau&s;e which he under|takes,
unle&s;s his client a&s;ks his opinion, and
then he is bound to give it hone&s;tly. The
ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of the cau&s;e is to be decided
by the judge. Con&s;ider, Sir, what is the pur|po&s;e
of courts of ju&s;tice? It is, that every man
may have his cau&s;e fairly tried, by men ap|pointed
to try cau&s;es. A lawyer is not to tell
what he knows to be a lie: he is not to produce
what he knows to be a fal&s;e deed; but he is
not to u&s;urp the province of the jury and of the
judge, and determine what &s;hall be the effect
of evidence&mdash;what &s;hall be the re&s;ult of legal
argument. As it rarely happens that a man is
fit to plead his own cau&s;e, lawyers are a cla&s;s
of the community, who, by &s;tudy and experi|ence,
<PB N="18" REF="24">
have acquired the art and power of ar|ranging
evidence, and of applying to the points
at i&s;&s;ue what the law has &s;ettled. A lawyer is
to do for his client all that his client might
fairly do for him&s;elf, if he could. If, by a &s;u|periority
of attention, of knowledge, of &s;kill,
and a better method of communication, he has
the advantage of his adver&s;ary, it is an advan|tage
to which he is entitled. There mu&s;t al|ways
be &s;ome advantage, on one &s;ide or other;
and it is better that advantage &s;hould be had
by talents, then by chance. If lawyers were
to undertake no cau&s;es till they were &s;ure they
were ju&s;t, a man might be precluded altogether
from a trial of his claim, though, were it judi|cially
examined, it might be found a very ju&s;t
claim.&endq;&mdash;This was &s;ound practical doctrine,
and rationally repre&s;&s;ed a too refined &s;crupulo|&s;ity
of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Emigration was at this time a common to|pick
of di&s;cour&s;e. Dr. John&s;on regretted it as
hurtful to human happine&s;s: &startq;For (&s;aid he)
it &s;preads mankind, which weakens the defence
of a nation, and le&s;&s;ens the comfort of living.
Men, thinly &s;cattered, make a &s;hift, but a bad
&s;hift, without many things. A &s;mith is ten
miles off: they'll do without a nail or a &s;taple.
A taylor is far from them: they'll botch their
own clothes. It is being concentrated which
produces high convenience.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="25">
Sir William Forbes, Mr. Scott, and I, ac|companied
Mr. John&s;on to the chapel, founded
by Lord Chief Baron Smith, for the &s;ervice of
the Church of England. The Reverend Mr.
Carre, the &s;enior clergyman, preached from
the&s;e words, &startq;Becau&s;e the Lord reigneth, let
the earth be glad.&endq;&mdash;I was &s;orry to think
Mr. John&s;on did not attend to the &s;ermon, Mr.
Carre's low voice not being &s;trong enough to
reach his hearing. A &s;election of Mr. Carre's
&s;ermons has, &s;ince his death, been publi&s;hed
by Sir William Forbes, and the world has ac|knowledged
their uncommon merit. I am
well a&s;&s;ured Lord Mansfield has pronounced
them to be excellent.</P>
<P>Here I obtained a promi&s;e from Lord Chief
Baron Orde, that he would dine at my hou&s;e
next day. I pre&s;ented Mr. John&s;on to his
Lord&s;hip, who politely &s;aid to him, &startq;I have
not the honour of knowing you; but I hope
for it, and to &s;ee you at my hou&s;e. I am to
wait on you to-morrow.&endq; This re&s;pectable
Engli&s;h judge will be long remembered in
Scotland, where he built an elegant hou&s;e, and
lived in it magnificently. His own ample
fortune, with the addition of his &s;alary, enabled
him to be &s;plendidly ho&s;pitable. It may be
fortunate for an individual among&s;t our&s;elves to
be Lord Chief Baron; and a mo&s;t worthy man
now has the office. But, in my opinion, it is
better for Scotland in general, that &s;ome of our
<PB N="20" REF="26">
publick employments &s;hould be filled by gen|tlemen
of di&s;tinction from the &s;outh &s;ide of the
Tweed, as we have the benefit of promotion in
England. Such an interchange would make a
beneficial mixture of manners, and render our
union more complete. Lord Chief Baron Orde
was on good terms with us all, in a narrow
country filled with jarring intere&s;ts and keen
parties; and, though I well knew his opinion
to be the &s;ame with my own, he kept him&s;elf
aloof at a very critical period indeed, when the
<HI>Douglas cau&s;e</HI> &s;hook the &s;acred &s;ecurity of <HI>birth|right</HI>
in Scotland to its foundation; a cau&s;e,
which had it happened before the Union, when
there was no appeal to a Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of
Lords, would have left the great fortre&s;s of
honours and of property in ruins.</P>
<P>When we got home, Dr. John&s;on de&s;ired
to &s;ee my books. He took down Ogden's Ser|mons
on Prayer, on which I &s;et a very high
value, having been much edified by them, and
he retired with them to his room. He did not
&s;tay long, but &s;oon joined us in the drawing|room.
I pre&s;ented to him Mr. Robert Ar|buthnot,
a relation of the celebrated Dr. Ar|buthnot,
and a man of literature and ta&s;te.
To him we were obliged for a previous recom|mendation,
which &s;ecured us a very agreeable
reception at St. Andrew's, and which Dr. John|&s;on,
in his Journey, a&s;cribes to &startq;&s;ome invi&s;ible
friend.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="27">
Of Dr. Beattie, Mr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;Sir, he
has written like a man con&s;cious of the truth,
and feeling his own &s;trength. Treating your
adver&s;ary with re&s;pect, is giving him an advan|tage
to which he is not entitled. The greate&s;t
part of men cannot judge of rea&s;oning, and are
impre&s;&s;ed by character; &s;o that, if you allow your
adver&s;ary a re&s;pectable character, they will think,
that though you differ from him, you may be
in the wrong. Sir, treating your adver&s;ary with
re&s;pect, is &s;triking &s;oft in a battle. And as to
<HI>Hume</HI>&mdash;a man who has &s;o much conceit as to
tell all mankind that they have been bubbled
for ages, and he is the wi&s;e man who &s;ees better
than they&mdash;a man who has &s;o little &s;crupulo&s;ity
as to venture to oppo&s;e tho&s;e principles which
have been thought nece&s;&s;ary to human happi|ne&s;s
&mdash;is he to be &s;urpri&s;ed if another man comes
and laughs at him? If he is the great man he
thinks him&s;elf, all this cannot hurt him: it is
like throwing peas again&s;t a rock.&endq; He added
&startq;<HI>&s;omething much too rough,</HI>&endq; both as to Mr.
Hume's head and heart, which I &s;uppre&s;s.
Violence is, in my opinion, not &s;uitable to the
Chri&s;tian cau&s;e. Be&s;ides, I always lived on
good terms with Mr. Hume, though I have
frankly told him, I was not clear that it was
right in me to keep company with him. &startq;But
(&s;aid I) how much better are you than your
<PB N="22" REF="28">
books!&endq; He was cheerful, obliging, and in|&s;tructive;
he was charitable to the poor; and
many an agreeable hour have I pa&s;&s;ed with him.
I have pre&s;erved &s;ome entertaining and inte|re&s;ting
memoirs of him, particularly when he
knew him&s;elf to be dying, which I may &s;ome
time or other communicate to the world. I
&s;hall not, however, extol him &s;o very highly as
Dr. <HI>Adam Smith</HI> does, who &s;ays, in a letter to

Sir William Forbes, Mr. Scott, Mr. Arbuth|not,

&startq;Come, Dr. John&s;on, (&s;aid I) it is commonly

But here is &s;ome which I believe you will

&startq;Why, Sir what is commonly thought, I
&s;hould take to be true. <HI>Your</HI> veal may be
good; but that will only be an exception to the
general opinion; not a proof again&s;t it.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Robert&s;on, according to the cu&s;tom of

between the forenoon and afternoon &s;ervice,
which was then later than now; &s;o we had not
the plea&s;ure of his company till dinner was over,
when he came and drank wine with us. And
then began &s;ome animated dialogue, of which
here follows a pretty full note.</P>
<P>We talked of Mr. Burke.&mdash;Dr. John&s;on
&s;aid, he had great variety of knowledge, &s;tore
of imagery, copiou&s;ne&s;s of language.&mdash;<HI>Ro|bert&s;on.</HI>
&startq;He has wit too.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on,</HI> &startq;No,
Sir; he never &s;ucceeds there. 'Tis low; 'tis
conceit. I u&s;ed to &s;ay, Burke never once
made a good joke<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>This was one of the points upon which Dr. John&s;on was &s;trangely heterodox. For, &s;urely, Mr. Burke, with his other remarkable qualities, is al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for his wit, and for wit of all kinds too; not merely that power of lan|guage which Pope chu&s;es to denominate wit,
<Q><L>(True wit is Nature to advantage dre&s;t;</L>
<L>What oft was thought, but ne'er &s;o well expre&s;t.)</L></Q>
but &s;urpri&s;ing allu&s;ions, brilliant &s;allies of vivacity, and plea|&s;ant conceits. His &s;peeches in parliament are &s;trewed with them. Take, for in&s;tance, the variety which he has given in his wide range, yet exact detail, when exhibiting his Reform Bill. And his conver&s;ation abounds in wit. Let me put down a &s;pecimen.&mdash;I told him, I had &s;een, at a <HI>Blue-&s;tocking</HI> a&s;&s;em|bly, a number of ladies &s;itting round a worthy and tall friend of ours, li&s;tening to his literature. &startq;Aye (&s;aid he) like maids round a May-pole.&endq;&mdash;I told him, I had found out a perfect definition of human nature, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the animal. An ancient philo&s;opher &s;aid, Man was &startq;a two|legged animal without feathers&endq;&mdash;upon which his rival Sage had a Cock plucked bare, and &s;et him down in the &s;chool be|fore all the di&s;ciples, as a &startq;Philo&s;ophic Man.&endq; Dr. Franklin &s;aid, Man was &startq;a tool-making animal,&endq; which is very well; for, no animal but man makes a thing, by means of which he can make another thing. But this applies to very few of the &s;pecies. My definition of <HI>Man</HI> is, &startq;a Cooking Animal.&endq; The bea&s;ts have memory, judgement, and all the faculties and pa&s;&s;ions of our mind, in a certain degree; but no bea&s;t is a cook. The trick of the monkey u&s;ing the cat's paw to roa&s;t a che&s;tnut, is only a piece of &s;hrewd malice in that <HI>turpi&s;&s;ima be&s;tia,</HI> which humbles us &s;o &s;adly by its &s;imilarity to us. Man alone can dre&s;s a good di&s;h; and every man whatever is more or le&s;s a cook, in &s;ea&s;oning what he him&s;elf eats.&mdash;Your defi|nition is good, &s;aid Mr. Burke, and I now &s;ee the full force of the common proverb, &startq;There is <HI>rea&s;on</HI> in roa&s;ting of eggs.&endq;&mdash;When Mr. <HI>Wilkes,</HI> in his days of tumultuous oppo&s;ition, was bor'n upon the &s;houlders of the mob, Mr. Burke (as Mr. Wilkes told me him&s;elf, with cla&s;&s;ical admiration) applied to him what <HI>Horace</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Pindar,</HI></P>

<P>Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, who agrees with me entirely as to Mr. Burke's fertility of wit, &s;aid, that this was &startq;dignifying a pun.&endq; He al&s;o ob&s;erved, that he has often heard Burke &s;ay, in the cour&s;e of an evening, ten good things, each of which would have &s;erved a noted wit (whom he named) to live upon for a twelvementh.</P></NOTE>.

&startq;No; I cannot &s;ay he is good at that. So
de&s;irous is he to talk, that, if one is &s;peaking at
this end of the table, he'll &s;peak to &s;omebody
at the other end. Burke, Sir, is &s;uch a man,
that if you met him for the fir&s;t time in a &s;treet
where you were &s;topped by a drove of oxen, and
you and he &s;tepped a&s;ide to take &s;helter but for

be long enough with me, without finding any

Burke was intended for the law; but either had
not money enough to follow it, or had not di|ligence
enough. He &s;aid, he could not under|&s;tand
how a man could apply to one thing, and
not to another. <HI>Robert&s;on</HI> &s;aid, one man had
more judgement, another more imagination.

&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, Sir; it is only one man has
more mind than another. He may direct it
differently; he may, by accident, &s;ee the &s;uc|ce&s;s
of one kind of &s;tudy, and take a de&s;ire to
excel in it. I am per&s;uaded that, had Sir I&s;aac
Newton applied to poetry, he would have made
a very fine epic poem. I could as ea&s;ily apply
to law as to tragick poetry.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;Yet,
Sir, you did apply to tragick poetry, not to

<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Nay, Sir; that is from mechanical

him <HI>before he began to be better than other

At the di&s;tance of four years from this con|ver&s;ation, 21&s;t February 1777, My Lord Archbi&s;hop of York, in his &startq;&s;ermon before the Society for the Propagation of the Go&s;pel in Foreign Parts,&endq; thus indignantly de&s;cribes the then &s;tate of parties:</P>

<P>Dr. William Robert&s;on came to breakfa&s;t.
We talked of <HI>Ogden</HI> on Prayer. Dr. John&s;on
&s;aid, &startq;The &s;ame arguments which are u&s;ed
again&s;t GOD'S hearing prayer, will &s;erve again&s;t
his rewarding good, and puni&s;hing evil. He

into Lord <HI>Hailes's</HI> &startq;Remarks on the Hi&s;tory of
Scotland.&endq; Dr. Robert&s;on and I &s;aid, it was
a pity Lord Hailes did not write greater things.
His lord&s;hip had not then publi&s;hed his &startq;An|nals
of Scotland.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;I remember
I was once on a vi&s;it at the hou&s;e of a lady for&endq;
<PB N="32" REF="38">
whom I had a high re&s;pect. There was a good
deal of company in the room. When they were
gone, I &s;aid to this lady, &startq;What fooli&s;h talk|ing
have we had!&endq;&mdash;&startq;Yes, (&s;aid &s;he) but
while they talked, you &s;aid nothing.&endq;&mdash;&startq;I was
&s;truck with the reproof. How much better is
the man who does any thing that is innocent,
than he who does nothing. Be&s;ides, I love
anecdotes. I fancy mankind may come, in
time, to write all aphori&s;tically, except in nar|rative;
grow weary of preparation, and con|nection,
and illu&s;tration, and all tho&s;e arts by
which a big book is made.&mdash;If a man is to wait
till he weaves anecdotes into a &s;y&s;tem, we may
be long in getting them, and get but few, in
compari&s;on of what we might get.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Robert&s;on &s;aid, the notions of <HI>Euphant
Macallan,</HI> a fanatick woman, of whom Lord
Hailes gives a &s;ketch, were &s;till prevalent a|mong
&s;ome of the Pre&s;byterians; and therefore
it was right in Lord Hailes, a man of known
piety, to undeceive them.</P>
<P>We walked out, that Dr. John&s;on might &s;ee
&s;ome of the things which we have to &s;hew at
Edinburgh. We went to the <HI>Parliament Hou&s;e,</HI>
where the Parliament of Scotland &s;at, and
where the <HI>Ordinary Lords</HI> of Se&s;&s;ion hold their
courts; and to the <HI>New Se&s;&s;ion Hou&s;e</HI> adjoining
to it, where our Court of <HI>Fifteen</HI> (the fourteen
<HI>Ordinaries,</HI> with the Lord Pre&s;ident at their
<PB N="33" REF="39">
head) &s;it as a Court of Review. We went to
the <HI>Advocates Library,</HI> of which Dr. John&s;on
took a cur&s;ory view, and then to what is called
the <HI>Laigh</HI> (or under) Parliament Hou&s;e, where
the records of Scotland, which has an univer&s;al
&s;ecurity by regi&s;ter, are depo&s;ited, till the great
Regi&s;ter Office be fini&s;hed. I loved to behold
Dr. Samuel John&s;on rolling about in this old
magazine of antiquities. There was, by this
time, a pretty numerous circle of us attending
upon him. Somebody talked of happy moments
for compo&s;ition; and how a man can write at
one time, and not at another.&mdash;&startq;Nay (&s;aid
Dr. John&s;on) a man may write at any time, if
he will &s;et him&s;elf doggedly to it.&endq;</P>
<P>I here began to indulge <HI>old Scotti&s;h</HI> &s;enti|ments,
and to expre&s;s a warm regret, that, by

could let your Queen remain twenty years in

even a pretence of ju&s;tice, without your ever at|tempting

as every man of any gallantry of &s;pirit would
have &s;acrificed his life for.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Worthy Mr.

fight your battles!&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;We &s;hould
have had you for the &s;ame price, though there
had been no union, as we might have had Swi&s;s,
or other troops. No, no, I &s;hall agree to a &s;e|paration.
You have only to <HI>go home.</HI>&endq;&mdash;Ju&s;t
as he had &s;aid this, I, to divert the &s;ubject,
&s;hewed him the &s;igned a&s;&s;urances of the three

is now very elegantly fitted up; but it was then

&s;hamefully dirty. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid nothing at
the time; but when we came to the great door
of the Royal Infirmary, where, upon a board,
was this in&s;cription, &startq;<HI>Clean your feet!</HI>&endq; he
turned about &s;lyly, and &s;aid, &startq;There is no oc|ca&s;ion
for putting this at the doors of your
churches!&endq;</P>
<P>We then conducted him down the Po&s;t-hou&s;e
&s;tairs, Parliament-clo&s;e, and made him look up
from the Cow-gate to the highe&s;t building in
Edinburgh (from which he had ju&s;t de&s;cended)
being thirteen floors or &s;tories from the ground
upon the back elevation; the front wall being
built upon the edge of the hill, and the back wall
ri&s;ing from the bottom of the hill &s;everal &s;tories
before it comes to a level with the front wall.
We proceeded to the College, with the Princi|pal
at our head. Dr. Adam Fergu&s;&s;on, who&s;e
&startq;E&s;&s;ay on the Hi&s;tory of civil Society,&endq; gives
him a re&s;pectable place in the ranks of litera|ture,
was with us. As the College buildings
are indeed very mean, the Principal &s;aid to
Dr. John&s;on, that he mu&s;t give them the &s;ame
epithet that a Je&s;uit did when &s;hewing a poor
college abroad: &startq;<HI>hae mi&s;eriae no&s;trae.</HI>&endq; Dr.
John&s;on was, however, much plea&s;ed with the
library, and with the conver&s;ation of Dr. James
Robert&s;on, Profe&s;&s;or of Oriental Languages,
the Librarian. We talked of <HI>Kennicot's</HI> Tran|&s;lation
of the Bible, and hoped it would be
<PB N="36" REF="42">
quite faithful.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, I know not
any crime &s;o great that a man could contrive
to commit, as poi&s;oning the &s;ources of eternal
truth.&endq;</P>
<P>I pointed out to him where there formerly
&s;tood an old wall enclo&s;ing part of the college,
which I remember bulged out in a threatening
manner, and of which there was a common
&s;aying, as of <HI>Bacon's</HI> Study at <HI>Oxford,</HI> that it
would fall upon the mo&s;t learned man. It had
&s;ome time before this been taken down, that
the &s;treet might be widened, and a more con|venient
wall built. Mr. John&s;on, glad of an
opportunity to have a plea&s;ant hit at Scotti&s;h
learning, &s;aid, &startq;they have been afraid it never
would fall.&endq;</P>
<P>We &s;hewed him the Royal Infirmary, for
which, and for every other exertion of generous
publick &s;pirit in his power, that noble-minded
citizen of Edinburgh, <HI>George Drummond,</HI>
will be ever held in honourable remembrance.
And we were too proud not to carry him to
the Abbey of <HI>Holyrood-hou&s;e,</HI> that beautiful
piece of architecture, but, alas! that de&s;erted
man&s;ion of royalty, which <HI>Hamilton</HI> of <HI>Bangour,</HI>
in one of his elegant poems, calls</P>
<Q><L>&startq;A virtuous palace, where no monarch dwells.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>I was much entertained while Principal
Robert&s;on fluently harangued to Dr. John&s;on,
<PB N="37" REF="43">
upon the &s;pot, concerning &s;cenes of his cele|brated
Hi&s;tory of Scotland. We &s;urveyed that
part of the palace appropriated to the Duke of
Hamilton, as Keeper, in which our beautiful
Queen Mary lived, and in which <HI>David Rizzio</HI>
was murdered; and al&s;o the State Rooms. Dr.
John&s;on was a great reciter of all &s;orts of things
&s;erious or comical. I over heard him repeat|ing
here, in a kind of muttering tone, a line of
the old ballad, <HI>Johnny Arm&s;trong's La&s;t Good-Night:</HI></P>

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e his thinking of the &s;tabbing of <HI>Rizzio</HI>

<P>We returned to my hou&s;e, where there met
him, at dinner, the Duche&s;s of Douglas, Sir
Adolphus Oughton, Lord Chief Baron, Sir Wil|liam
Forbes, Principal Robert&s;on, Mr. Cullen,
advocate. Before dinner, he told us of a cu|rious
conver&s;ation between the famous <HI>George
Faulkner</HI> and him. George &s;aid that England
had drained Ireland of fifty thou&s;and pounds in
&s;pecie, annually, for fifty years. &startq;How &s;o,

liberty to a&s;k him, if Swift had per&s;onally of|fended
him, and he told me, he had not. He
&s;aid to-day, Swift is clear, but he is &s;hallow.
In coar&s;e humour, he is inferiour to Arbuthnot;
in delicate humour, he is inferiour to Addi&s;on:
So he is inferiour to his contemporaries; without
putting him again&s;t the whole world. I doubt
if the &startq;Tale of a Tub&endq; was his; it has &s;o much

more colour, than any of the works which are
indi&s;putably his. If it was his, I &s;hall only
&s;ay, He was <HI>impar &s;ibi.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>We gave him as good a dinner as we could.
Our Scots muir-fowl, or grow&s;e, were then
abundant, and quite in &s;ea&s;on; and, &s;o far as
wi&s;dom and wit can be aided by admini&s;tering
agreeable &s;en&s;ations to the palate, my wife took
care that our great gue&s;t &s;hould not be defi|cient.</P>

&s;cholars I ever knew, had learnt the Er&s;e lan|guage,
and expre&s;&s;ed his belief in the authenti|city

was afraid the di&s;pute would have run high
between them. But Sir Adolphus, who had a

Dr. Adam Fergu&s;&s;on, Mr. Cro&s;bie, ad|vocate.
Witchcraft was introduced. <HI>Cro&s;bie</HI>
&s;aid, he thought it the greate&s;t bla&s;phemy to
&s;uppo&s;e evil &s;pirits counteracting the Deity,
and rai&s;ing &s;torms, for in&s;tance, to de&s;troy his
creatures.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why, Sir, if moral evil
be con&s;i&s;tent with the government of the Deity,
why may not phy&s;ical evil be al&s;o con&s;i&s;tent
with it? It is not more &s;trange that there &s;hould
be evil &s;pirits, than evil men; evil unembodied
&s;pirits, than evil embodied &s;pirits. And as to
&s;torms, we know there are &s;uch things; and it
is no wor&s;e that evil &s;pirits rai&s;e them, than
that they ri&s;e.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Cro&s;bie.</HI>&startq;But it is not cre|dible,
that &s;uch &s;tories as we are told of witches
have happened.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir,&endq; I am not de|fending
their credibility. I am only &s;aying,
that your arguments are not good, and will not
<PB N="40" REF="46">
overturn the belief of witchcraft.&mdash;(Dr. Fer|gu&s;&s;on
&s;aid to me, a&s;ide, &startq;He is right.&endq;)&mdash;
And then, Sir you have all mankind, rude and
civili&s;ed, agreeing in the belief of the agency
of preternatural powers. You mu&s;t take evi|dence:
you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that wi&s;e and great
men have condemned witches to die.&punc;&mdash;
<HI>Cro&s;bie.</HI> &startq;But an act of parliament put an end
to witchcraft.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, Sir! witch|craft
had cea&s;ed; and therefore an act of par|liament
was pa&s;&s;ed to prevent per&s;ecution for
what was not witchcraft. Why it cea&s;ed, we
cannot tell, as we cannot tell the rea&s;on of many
other things.&endq;&mdash;Dr. <HI>Cullen,</HI> to keep up the gra|tification
of my&s;terious di&s;qui&s;ition, with the
grave addre&s;s for which he is remarkable in his
companionable as in his profe&s;&s;ional hours,
talked, in a very entertaining manner, of people
walking and conver&s;ing in their &s;leep. I am
very &s;orry I have no note of this. We talked
of the <HI>Ouran-Outang,</HI> and of Lord Monboddo's
thinking that he might be taught to &s;peak.
Dr. John&s;on treated this with ridicule. Mr.
<HI>Cro&s;bie</HI> &s;aid, that Lord Monboddo believed the
exi&s;tence of every thing po&s;&s;ible; in &s;hort,
that all which is in <HI>po&s;&s;e</HI> might be found in <HI>e&s;&s;e.</HI>
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;But, Sir, it is as po&s;&s;ible that the
<HI>Ouran Outang</HI> does not &s;peak, as that he &s;peaks.
However, I &s;hall not conte&s;t the point. I
&s;hould have thought it not po&s;&s;ible to find a

the &s;tage.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;The appearance of a

the imagination that he is the character he

<P>Sir William Forbes came to breakfa&s;t, and
brought with him Dr. <HI>Blacklock,</HI> whom he in|troduced
to Dr. John&s;on, who received him
with a mo&s;t humane complacency, &startq;Dear Dr.
Blacklock, I am glad to &s;ee you!&endq;&mdash;Blacklock
&s;eemed to be much &s;urprized, when Dr. John|&s;on
&s;aid, &startq;it was ea&s;ier to him to write poetry
than to compo&s;e his Dictionary. His mind was
le&s;s on the &s;tretch in doing the one than the
other. Be&s;ides, compo&s;ing a Dictionary re|quires
books and a de&s;k. You can make a
poem walking in the fields, or lying in bed.&endq;&mdash;
Dr. <HI>Blacklock</HI> &s;poke of &s;ceptici&s;m in morals and
religion, with apparent unea&s;ine&s;s, as if he
wi&s;hed for more certainty. Dr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> who had
thought it all over, and who&s;e vigorous under|&s;tanding
was fortified by much experience, thus
encouraged the blind Bard to apply to higher
&s;peculations, what we all willingly &s;ubmit to in

common life. In &s;hort, he gave him more fa|miliarly
the able and fair rea&s;oning of <HI>Butler's
Analogy:</HI> &startq;Why, Sir, the greate&s;t concern we
have in this world, the choice of our profe&s;&s;ion,
mu&s;t be determined without demon&s;trative
rea&s;oning. Human life is not yet &s;o well
known, as that we can have it. And take the
ca&s;e of a man who is ill. I call two phy&s;icians:
they differ in opinion. I am not to lye down,
and die between them: I mu&s;t do &s;omething.&endq;
&mdash;The conver&s;ation then turned on Athei&s;m;
on that horrible book <HI>Sy&s;t&eacute;me de la Nature;</HI> and
on the &s;uppo&s;ition of an eternal nece&s;&s;ity, with|out
de&s;ign, without a governing mind.&mdash;<HI>John|&s;on.</HI>
&startq;If it were &s;o, why has it cea&s;ed? Why
don't we &s;ee men thus produced around us now?
Why, at lea&s;t, does it not keep pace, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, with the progre&s;s of time? If it &s;tops

concerning <HI>vicious intromi&s;&s;ion,</HI> that is to &s;ay, in|termeddling
with the effects of a decea&s;ed per&s;on,
without a regular title, which formerly was
under&s;tood to &s;ubject the intermeddler in pay|ment
of all the defunct's debts. The principle
has of late been relaxed. Dr. John&s;on's argu|ment
was, for a renewal of its &s;trictne&s;s. The
paper was printed, with additions by me, and
given into the Court of Se&s;&s;ion. Lord Hailes
knew Dr. John&s;on's part not to be mine, and
pointed out exactly where it began, and where

Engli&s;h, of which Dr. John&s;on did not change
one word. In the other, which was in Latin,
he made &s;everal alterations. In place of the
very words of <HI>Virgil, &startq;Ubi luctus et pavor et

<P>On this day we &s;et out from Edinburgh.
We &s;hould gladly have had Mr. Scott to go
with us; but he was obliged to return to En|gland.
&mdash;I have given a &s;ketch of Dr. John&s;on.
My readers may wi&s;h to know a little of his
fellow-traveller. Think, then, of a gentleman
of ancient blood, the pride of which was his
predominant pa&s;&s;ion. He was then in his
thirty-third year, and had been about four
years happily married. His inclination was to
<PB N="47" REF="53">
be a Soldier; but his father, a re&s;pectable Judge,
had pre&s;&s;ed him into the profe&s;&s;ion of the law.
He had travelled a good deal, and &s;een many
varieties of human life. He had thought more
than any body &s;uppo&s;ed, and had a pretty good
&s;tock of general learning and knowledge. He
had all Dr. John&s;on's principles, with &s;ome de|gree
of relaxation. He had rather too little,
than too much prudence; and, his imagination
being lively, he often &s;aid things of which the
effect was very different from the intention.
He re&s;embled &s;ometimes</P>
<Q><L>&startq;The be&s;t good man, with the wor&s;t-natur'd mu&s;e.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>He cannot deny him&s;elf the vanity of fini&s;hing
with the encomium of Dr. Johnfon, who&s;e
friendly partiality to the companion of his Tour,
repre&s;ents him as one &startq;who&s;e acutene&s;s would
help my inquiry, and who&s;e gaiety of conver|&s;ation,
and civility of manners, are &s;ufficient
to counteract the inconveniencies of travel, in
countries le&s;s ho&s;pitable than we have pa&s;&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Johnfon thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to put
him&s;ef to the additional expence of bringing
with him <HI>Francis Barber,</HI> his faithful black &s;er|vant;
&s;o we were attended only by my man,
<HI>Jo&s;eph Ritter,</HI> a Bohemian; a fine &s;tately fellow
above &s;ix feet high, who had been over a great
part of Europe, and &s;poke many languages.
He was the be&s;t &s;ervant I ever &s;aw in my life.

Let not my readers di&s;dain his introduction&punc;
For Dr. John&s;on gave him this character:
&startq;Sir, he is a civil man, and a wi&s;e man.&endq;</P>
<P>From an erroneous apprehen&s;ion of violence,
Dr. John&s;on had provided a pair of pi&s;tols, &s;ome
gunpowder, and a quantity of bullets. But
upon being a&s;&s;ured we &s;hould run no ri&s;k of
meeting any robbers, he left his arms and
ammunition in an open drawer, of which he gave
my wife the charge. He al&s;o left in that drawer
one volume of a pretty full and curious Diary of
his Life, of which I have a few fragments; but
the book has been de&s;troyed. I wi&s;h female
curio&s;ity had been &s;trong enough to have had it
all tran&s;cribed, which might ea&s;ily have been
done; and I &s;hould think the theft, being <HI>pro

may be wrong. My wife told me &s;he never
once looked into it.&mdash;She did not &s;eem quite

<P>Mr. Nairne, advocate, was to go with us as

<P>In cro&s;&s;ing the Frith, Dr. John&s;on deter|mined
that we &s;hould land upon Inch Keith.
On approaching it, we fir&s;t ob&s;erved a high
rocky &s;hore. We coa&s;ted about, and put into
a little bay on the North-we&s;t. We clambered
up a very &s;teep a&s;cent, on which was very good
gra&s;s, but rather a profu&s;ion of thi&s;tles. There
were &s;ixteen head of black cattle grazing upon
the i&s;land. Lord Hailes ob&s;erved to me, that
<HI>Brantome</HI> calls it <HI>L'i&s;le des Chevaux,</HI> and that it
was probably &startq;a <HI>&s;afer</HI> &s;table&endq; than many others
in his time. The fort, with an in&s;cription on
it, <HI>Maria Re</HI> 1564, is &s;trongly built. Dr.
John&s;on examined it with much attention. He
&s;talked like a giant among the luxuriant thi&s;tles
and nettles. There are three wells in the
i&s;land; but we could not find one in the fort.
There mu&s;t probably have been one, though
now filled up, as a garri&s;on could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t
without it. But I have dwelt too long on this
little &s;pot. Dr. John&s;on afterwards bid me try
to write a de&s;cription of our di&s;covering Inch
Keith, in the u&s;ual &s;tyle of travellers, de|&s;cribing
fully every particular; how we con|cluded
that it mu&s;t have once been inhabited,
and introducing many &s;age reflections; and we
&s;hould &s;ee how a thing might be covered in
<PB N="52" REF="58">
words, &s;o as to induce people to come and &s;ee
it. All that was &s;aid might be true, and yet
in reality there might be nothing to &s;ee. He
&s;aid, &startq;I'd have this i&s;land. I'd build a hou&s;e,
make a good landing-place, have a garden,
and vines, and all &s;orts of trees. A rich man,
of a ho&s;pitable turn, here, would have many
vi&s;itors from Edinburgh.&endq; When we had got
into our boat again, he called to me, &startq;Come,
now, pay a cla&s;&s;ical compliment to the i&s;land
on quitting it.&endq; I happened luckily, in allu|&s;ion
to the beautiful Queen Mary, who&s;e name

We had a dreary drive, in a du&s;ky night, to
St. Andrew's where we arrived late. We
found a good &s;upper at Gla&s;s's inn, and Dr.
John&s;on revived agreeably. He &s;aid, the col|lection
called &startq;The Mu&s;es' Welcome to King
James,&endq; (fir&s;t of England, and &s;ixth of Scotland,)
on his return to his native kingdom, &s;hewed
that there was then abundance of learning in
Scotland; and that the conceits in that collec|tion,
with which people find fault, were mere
mode. He &s;aid, we could not now entertain a
&s;overeign &s;o; that Buchanan had &s;pread the
&s;pirit of learning among&s;t us, but we had lo&s;t
it during the civil wars. He did not allow the
Latin poetry of Pitcairne &s;o much merit, as
has been u&s;ually attributed to it; though he
owned that one of his pieces which he men|tioned,
but which I am &s;orry is not &s;pecified
in my notes, was &startq;very well.&endq; It is not im|probable

us with a candle, and the waiter with a lantern.
That college had &s;ome time before been di&s;|&s;olved;
and Dr. Wat&s;on, a profe&s;&s;or here, (the
hi&s;torian of Philip II.) had purcha&s;ed the
ground, and what buildings remained. When
we entered his court, it &s;eemed quite academi|cal;

<HEAD>Thur&s;day, <DATE>19th Augu&s;t.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We ro&s;e much refre&s;hed. I had with me a
map of Scotland, a Bible, which was given me
by Lord Mount&s;tuart when we were together
in Italy, and Ogden's Sermons on Prayer.
Mr. Nairne introduced us to Dr. Wat&s;on,
whom we found a well-informed man, of very
amiable manners. Dr. John&s;on, after they
were acquainted, &s;aid, &startq;I take great delight
in him.&endq;&mdash;His daughter, a very plea&s;ing young
lady, made breakfa&s;t. Dr. Wat&s;on ob&s;erved,
that Gla&s;gow Univer&s;ity had fewer home &s;tu|dents,
&s;ince trade increa&s;ed, as learning was
rather incompatible with it.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why,
&s;ir, as trade is now carried on by &s;ubordinate
hands, men in trade have as much lei&s;ure as
others; and now learning it&s;elf is a trade. A
man goes to a book&s;eller, and gets what he
can. We have done with patronage. In the
infancy of learning, we find &s;ome great man
prai&s;ed for it. This diffu&s;ed it among others.
<PB N="56" REF="62">
When it becomes general, an authour leaves
the great, and applies to the multitude.&endq;&mdash;
<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;It is a &s;hame that authours are not
now better patronized.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, &s;ir.
If learning cannot &s;upport a man, if he mu&s;t
&s;it with his hands acro&s;s till &s;omebody feeds
him, it is as to him a bad thing, and it is
better as it is. With patronage, what flattery!
what fal&s;ehood! While a man is in equilibrio,
he throws truth among the multitude, and
lets them take it as they plea&s;e: in patronage,
he mu&s;t &s;ay what plea&s;es his patron, and it is an
equal chance whether that be truth or fal&s;e|hood.&endq;
&mdash;<HI>Wat&s;on.</HI> &startq;But is not the ca&s;e now,
that, in&s;tead of flattering one per&s;on, we flatter
the age?&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, &s;ir. The world al|ways
lets a man tell what he thinks, his own
way. I wonder however, that &s;o many people
have written, who might have let it alone.
That people &s;hould endeavour to excel in con|ver&s;ation,
I do not wonder; becau&s;e in conver|&s;ation
prai&s;e is in&s;tantly reverberated.&endq;</P>
<P>We talked of change of manners. Dr. John|&s;on
ob&s;erved, that our drinking le&s;s than our
ance&s;tors was owing to the change from ale to
wine. &startq;I remember (&s;aid he) when all the
<HI>decent</HI> people in Lichfield got drunk every night,&endq;
and were not the wor&s;e thought of. Ale was
cheap, &s;o you pre&s;&s;ed &s;trongly. When a man
mu&s;t bring a bottle of wine, he is not in &s;uch
<PB N="57" REF="63">
ha&s;te. Smoaking has gone out. To be &s;ure,
it is a &s;hocking thing, blowing &s;moak out of
our mouths into other peoples mouths, eyes,
and no&s;es, and having the &s;ame thing done to
us. Yet I cannot account why a thing which
requires &s;o little exertion, and yet pre&s;erves the
mind from total vacuity, &s;hould have gone out.
Every man has &s;omething by which he calms
him&s;elf: beating with his feet, or &s;o<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on u&s;ed to practice this him&s;elf very much.</NOTE>. I re|member
when people in England changed a
&s;hirt only once a week: a Pandour, when he
gets a &s;hirt, grea&s;es it to make it la&s;t. For|merly,
good trade&s;men had no fire but in the
kitchen; never in the parlour, except on Sun|day.
My father, who was a magi&s;trate of
Lichfield, lived thus. They never began to
have a fire in the parlour, but on leaving off
bu&s;ine&s;s, or &s;ome great revolution of their life.&endq;
&mdash;Dr. <HI>Wat&s;on</HI> &s;aid, the hall was as a kitchen,
in old &s;quires hou&s;es.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, Sir.
The hall was for great occa&s;ions, and never was
u&s;ed for dome&s;tick refection.&endq;&mdash;We talked of
the Union, and what money it had brought
into Scotland. Dr. Wat&s;on ob&s;erved, that a
little money formerly went as far as a great
deal now.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;In &s;peculation, it &s;eems
that a &s;maller quantity of money, equal in value
to a larger quantity, if equally divided, &s;hould
produce the &s;ame effect. But it is not &s;o in
<PB N="58" REF="64">
reality. Many more conveniences and elegan|cies
are enjoyed where money is plenty, than
where it is &s;carce. Perhaps a great familiarity
with it, which ari&s;es from plenty, makes us
more ea&s;ily part with it.&endq;</P>
<P>After what Dr. John&s;on has &s;aid of St. An|drew's,
which he had long wi&s;hed to &s;ee, as our
ancient univer&s;ity, and the &s;eat of our Primate
in the days of epi&s;copacy, I can &s;ay little.
Since the publication of Dr. John&s;on's book, I
find that he has been cen&s;ured for not &s;eeing
here the ancient chapel of <HI>St. Rule,</HI> a curious
piece of &s;acred architecture. But this was
neither his fault nor mine. We were both of
us abundantly de&s;irous of &s;urveying &s;uch &s;ort
of antiquities; but neither of us knew of this.
I am afraid the cen&s;ure mu&s;t fall on tho&s;e who
did not tell us of it. In every place, where
there is any thing worthy of ob&s;ervation, there
&s;hould be a &s;hort printed directory for &s;trangers,
&s;uch as we find in all the towns of Italy, and in
fome of the towns in England. I was told
that there is a manu&s;cript account of St. An|drew's,
by Martin, &s;ecretary to Archbi&s;hop
Sharp; and that one Douglas has publi&s;hed a
&s;mall account of it. I inquired at a book&s;el|ler's,
but could not get it. Dr. John&s;on's ve|neration
for the Hierarchy is well known.
There is no wonder then, that he was affected
with a &s;trong indignation, while he beheld the
<PB N="59" REF="65">
ruins of religious magnificence. I happened
to a&s;k where John Knox was buried. Dr. John|&s;on
bur&s;t out, &startq;I hope in the high-way. I
have been looking at his reformations.&endq;</P>
<P>It was a very fine day. Dr. John&s;on &s;eemed
quite wrapt up in the contemplation of the
&s;cenes which were now pre&s;ented to him. He
kept his hat off while he was upon any part of
the ground where the Cathedral had &s;tood. He
&s;aid well, that &startq;Knox had &s;et on a mob, without
knowing where it would end; and that differ|ing
from a man in doctrine was no rea&s;on why
you &s;hould pull his hou&s;e about his ears.&endq; As
we walked in the cloi&s;ters, there was a &s;olemn
echo, while he talked loud of a proper retire|ment
from the world. Mr. <HI>Nairne</HI> &s;aid, he had
an inclination to retire. I called Dr. John&s;on's
attention to this, that I might hear his opinion
if it was right.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Yes, when he has
done his duty to &s;ociety.&endq; In general, as every
man is obliged not only to &startq;love GOD, but his
neighbour as him&s;elf,&endq; he mu&s;t bear his part in
active life; yet there are exceptions. Tho&s;e
who are exceedingly &s;crupulous (which I do
not approve, for I am no friend to &s;cruples) and
find their &s;crupulo&s;ity invincible, &s;o that they
are quite in the dark, and know not what they
&s;hall do&mdash;or tho&s;e who cannot re&s;i&s;t tempta|tions,
and find they make them&s;elves wor&s;e by
being in the world, without making it better,
<PB N="60" REF="66">
may retire. I never read of a hermit, but in
imagination I ki&s;s his feet; never of a mona&s;|tery,
but I could fall on my knees, and ki&s;s the
pavement. But I think putting young people
there, who know nothing of life, nothing of
retirement, is dangerous and wicked. It is a
&s;aying as old as He&s;iod,
<Q><L><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</L></Q>
That is a very noble line: not that young men
&s;hould not pray, or old men not give coun&s;el,
but that every &s;ea&s;on of life has its proper du|ties.
I have thought of retiring, and have
talked of it to a friend; but I find my vocation
is rather to active life.&endq; I &s;aid <HI>&s;ome</HI> young
monks might be allowed, to &s;hew that it is not
age alone that can retire to pious &s;olitude;
but he thought this would only &s;hew they could
not re&s;i&s;t temptation.</P>
<P>He wanted to mount the &s;teeples, but it
could not be done. There are no good in|&s;criptions
here. Bad Roman characters he na|turally
mi&s;took for half Gothick, half Roman.
One of the &s;teeples, which he was told was in
danger, he wi&s;hed not to be taken down; &startq;for,
&s;aid he, it may fall on &s;ome of the po&s;terity of
John Knox; and no great matter!&endq; Dinner
was mentioned.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Aye, aye; amid&s;t
all the&s;e &s;orrowful &s;cenes, I have no objection
to dinner.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="67">
We went and looked at the ca&s;tle, where
Cardinal Beaton was murdered, and then vi|&s;ited
Principal Muri&s;on at his college, where
is a good library-room; but the Principal
was abundantly vain of it, for he &s;eriou&s;ly &s;aid
to Dr. John&s;on, &startq;you have not &s;uch a one in
England.&endq;</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ors entertained us with a very
good dinner. Pre&s;ent: Muri&s;on, Shaw,
Cooke, Hill, Haddo, Wat&s;on, Flint,
Brown. I ob&s;erved, that I wondered to &s;ee him
eat &s;o well, after viewing &s;o many &s;orrowful
&s;cenes of ruined religious magnificence. &startq;Why,
&s;aid he, I am not &s;orry, after &s;eeing the&s;e gen|tlemen;
for they are not &s;orry.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Muri&s;on</HI> &s;aid,
all &s;orrow was bad, as it was murmuring again&s;t
the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Sir, &s;orrow is inherent in humanity. As you
cannot judge two and two to be either five, or
three, but certainly four, &s;o, when comparing
a wor&s;e pre&s;ent &s;tate with a better which is
pa&s;t, you cannot but feel &s;orrow. It is
not cured by rea&s;on, but by the incur&s;ion
of pre&s;ent objects, which wear out the
pa&s;t. You need not murmur, though you
are &s;orry.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Muri&s;on.</HI> &startq;But St. Paul &s;ays, &startq;I
have learnt, in whatever &s;tate I am, therewith
to be content.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, that relates
to riches and poverty; for we &s;ee St. Paul, when
he had a thorn in the fle&s;h, prayed earne&s;tly to&endq;
<PB N="62" REF="68">
&startq;have it removed; and then he could not be
content.&endq;&mdash;Muri&s;on, thus refuted, tried to be
&s;mart, and drank to Dr. John&s;on, &startq;Long may
you lecture!&endq;&mdash;Dr. John&s;on afterwards, &s;peak|ing
of his not drinking wine, &s;aid, &startq;The Doc|tor
&s;poke of <HI>lecturing</HI> (looking to him). I give
all the&s;e lectures on water.&endq;</P>
<P>He defended requiring &s;ub&s;cription in tho&s;e
admitted to univer&s;ities, thus: &startq;As all who
come into the country mu&s;t obey the king, &s;o
all who come into an univer&s;ity mu&s;t be of the
church.&endq;</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t do Dr. John&s;on the ju&s;tice
to contradict a very ab&s;urd and ill-natured &s;tory,
as to what pa&s;&s;ed at St. Andrew's It has been
circulated, that, after grace was &s;aid in En|gli&s;h,
in the u&s;ual manner, he with the greate&s;t
marks of contempt, as if he had held it to be
no grace in an univer&s;ity, would not &s;it down
till he had &s;aid grace aloud in Latin. This
would have been an in&s;ult indeed to the gen|tlemen
who wer entertaining us. But the
truth was preci&s;ely thus. In the cour&s;e of con|ver&s;ation
at dinner, Dr. John&s;on, in very good
humour, &s;aid, &startq;I &s;hould have expected to
have heard a Latin grace, among &s;o many
learned men: we had always a Latin grace
at Oxford. I believe I can repeat it.&endq; Which
he did, as giving the learned men in one place
<PB N="63" REF="69">
a &s;pecimen of what was done by the learned men
in another place.</P>
<P>We went and &s;aw the church, in which is
Archbi&s;hop Sharp's monument. I was &s;truck
with the &s;ame kind of feelings with which the
churches of Italy impre&s;&s;ed me. I was plea&s;ed,
curiou&s;ly plea&s;ed, to &s;ee Dr. John&s;on actually
in St. Andrew's, of which we had talked &s;o long.
Profe&s;&s;or Haddo was with us this afternoon,
along with Dr. Wat&s;on. We looked at St. Sal|vador's
College. The rooms for &s;tudents &s;eemed
very commodious, and Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, the
chapel was the neate&s;t place of wor&s;hip he had
&s;een. The key of the library could not be
found; for it &s;eems Profe&s;&s;or Hill, who was out
of town had taken it with him. Dr. John&s;on
told a joke he had heard of a mona&s;tery abroad,
where the key of the library could never be
found.</P>
<P>It was &s;omewhat di&s;piriting, to &s;ee this an|cient
archiepi&s;copal city now &s;adly de&s;erted.
We &s;aw in one of its &s;trets a remarkable proof
of liberal toleration; a nonjuring clergyman,
with a jolly countenance and a round belly, like
a well-fed monk, &s;trutting about in his canoni|cals.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved two occupations united in the
&s;ame per&s;on, who had hung out two &s;ign-po&s;ts.
Upon one was &startq;James Hood, White Iron
Smith&endq; (<HI>i. e.</HI> Tin-plate Worker). Upon
<PB N="64" REF="70">
another &startq;The Art of Fencing taught, by
James Hood.&endq;&mdash;Upon this la&s;t were painted
&s;ome trees and two men fencing, one of whom
had hit the other in the eye, to &s;hew his great
dexterity; &s;o that the art was well taught.&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Were I &s;tudying here, I &s;hould go
and take a le&s;&s;on. I remember <HI>Hope,</HI> in his
book on this art, &s;ays,&endq; &startq;the Scotch are very
good fencers.&endq;</P>
<P>We returned to the inn, where we had been
entertained at dinner, and drank tea in company
with &s;ome of the Profe&s;&s;ors, of who&s;e civilities
I beg leave to add my humble and very grateful
acknowledgement to the honourable te&s;timony
of Dr. John&s;on, in his &startq;Journey.&endq;</P>
<P>We talked of compo&s;ition, which was a fa|vourite
topick of Dr. Wat&s;on's, who fir&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
him&s;elf by lectures on rhetorick.&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on,</HI> &startq;I advi&s;ed Chambers, and would ad|vi&s;e
every young man beginning to compo&s;e, to
do it as fa&s;t as he can, to get a habit of having
his mind to &s;tart promptly; it is &s;o much more
difficult to improve in &s;peed than in accuracy.&endq;
&mdash;<HI>Wat&s;on.</HI> &startq;I own I am for much attention to
accuracy in compo&s;ing, le&s;t one &s;hould get bad
habits of doing it in a &s;lovenly manner.&endq;&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why, Sir, you are confounding <HI>do|ing</HI>
inaccurately with the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of doing inac|curately.
A man knows when his compo&s;ition
is inaccurate, and when he thinks fit he'll cor|rect&endq;
<PB N="65" REF="71">
&startq;it. But, if a man is accu&s;tomed to com|po&s;e
&s;lowly, and with difficulty, upon all occa|&s;ions,
there is danger that he may not compo&s;e
at all, as we do not like to do that which is not
done ea&s;ily; and, at any rate, more time is
con&s;umed in a &s;mall matter than ought to be.&endq;
&mdash;<HI>Wat&s;on</HI> &s;aid, &startq;Dr. Hugh Blair took a week
to compo&s;e a &s;ermon.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Then, Sir,
that is for want of the habit of compo&s;ing
quickly, which I am in&s;i&s;ting one &s;hould ac|quire.&endq;

all the week, but only &s;uch hours as he
found him&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed for compo&s;ition.&endq;&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Nay, Sir, unle&s;s you tell me the time
he took, you tell me nothing. If I &s;ay I took
a week to walk a mile, and have had the gout
five days, and been ill otherwi&s;e another day, I
have taken but one day. I my&s;elf have com|po&s;ed
about forty &s;ermons. I have begun a
&s;ermon after dinner, and &s;ent it off by the po&s;t
that night. I wrote forty-eight of the printed
octavo pages of the Life of Savage at a &s;itting;
but then I &s;at up all night. I have al&s;o writ|ten
&s;ix &s;heets in a day of tran&s;lation from the

how one man dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;lowly, and another
fa&s;t.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Yes, Sir; it is wonderful
how much time &s;ome people will con&s;ume in

<P>Dr. Shaw, the profe&s;&s;or of di$$nity, break|fa&s;ted
with us. I took out my &startq;Ogden on
Prayer,&endq; and read &s;ome of it to the company
Dr. John&s;on prai&s;ed him. &startq;Abernethy (&s;aid
he) allows only of a phy&s;ical effect of prayer
upon the mind, which may be produced many
ways, as well as by prayer; for in&s;tance, by
meditation. Ogden goes farther. In truth,
<PB N="67" REF="73">
we have the con&s;ent of all nations for the effi|cacy
of prayer, whether offered up by indivi|duals,
or by a&s;&s;&eacute;mblies; and Revelation has
told us, it will be effectual.&endq;&mdash;I &s;aid, &startq;Leech|man
&s;eemed to incline to Abernethy's doctrine.&endq;
&mdash;<HI>Wat&s;on</HI> ob&s;erved, that Leechman meant to
&s;hew, that, even admitting no effect to be pro|duced
by prayer, re&s;pecting the Deity, it was
u&s;eful to our own minds. He had given only
a part of his &s;y&s;tem: Dr. <HI>John&s;on</HI> thought he
&s;hould have given the whole.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on enforced the &s;trict ob&s;ervance
of Sunday. Said he, &startq;It &s;hould be different
from another day. People may walk; but not
throw &s;tones at birds. There may be relaxation,
but there &s;hould be no levity.&endq;</P>
<P>We went and &s;aw Colonel Nairne's garden
and grotto. Here was a fine old plane tree.
Unluckily the colonel &s;aid, there was but this
and another large tree in the county. This
was an excellent cue for Dr. John&s;on, who
laughed enormou&s;ly, calling to me to hear this.
He had expatiated to me on the nakedne&s;s of
that part of Scotland which he had &s;een. His
Journey has been violently abu&s;ed, for what
he has &s;aid upon this &s;ubject. But let it be
con&s;idered, that, when Dr. John&s;on talks of
trees, he means trees of good &s;ize, &s;uch as he
was accu&s;tomed to &s;ee in England; and of
the&s;e there are certainly very few upon the
<PB N="68" REF="74">
<HI>ea&s;tern coa&s;t</HI> of Scotland. Be&s;ides, he &s;aid, that
he meant to give only a map of the road; and
let any traveller ob&s;erve how many trees, which
de&s;erve the name, he can &s;ee from the road
from Berwick to Aberdeen, Had Dr. John&s;on
&s;aid &startq;there are <HI>no</HI> trees&endq; upon this line, he
would have &s;aid what is colloquially true; be|cau&s;e,
by no trees, in common &s;peech, we mean
few. When he is particular in counting, he
may be attacked. I know not how Colonel
Nairne came to &s;ay there were but <HI>two</HI> large
trees in the county of Fife. I did not perceive
that he &s;miled. There are not a great many
to be &s;ure; but I could have &s;hewn him more
than two at <HI>Balmuto,</HI> from whence my ance&s;to$
came.</P>
<P>In the grotto, we &s;aw a wonderful large
lob&s;ter claw. In front of it were petrified
&s;tocks of fir, plane, and &s;ome other tree. Dr.
John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;Scotland has no right to boa&s;t
of this grotto; it is owing to per&s;onal merit.
I never denied per&s;onal merit to many of you.&endq;
&mdash;Profe&s;&s;or Shaw &s;aid to me, as we walked,
&startq;This is a wonderful man: he is ma&s;ter of
every &s;ubject he handles.&endq;&mdash;Dr. Wat&s;on allowed
him a very &s;trong under&s;tanding, but wondered
at his total inattention to e&s;tabli&s;hed manners,
as he came from London.</P>
<P>I have not pre&s;erved, in my Journal, any of
the conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed between Dr.
<PB N="69" REF="75">
John&s;on and Profe&s;&s;or Shaw; but I recollect
Dr. John&s;on &s;aid to me afterwards, &startq;I took
much to Shaw.&endq;</P>
<P>We left St. Andrew's about noon, and &s;ome
miles from it ob&s;erving, at <HI>Leuchars,</HI> a church
with an old tower, we &s;topped to look at it.
The <HI>man&s;e,</HI> as the par&s;onage-hou&s;e is called in
Scotland, was clo&s;e by. I waited on the mi|ni&s;ter,
mentioned our names, and begged he
would tell us what he knew about it. He was
a very civil old man; but could only inform
us, that it was &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;tood eight hun|dred
years. He told us, there was a colony of
Danes in his pari&s;h; that they had landed at a
remote period of time, and &s;till remained a di|&s;tinct
people. Dr. John&s;on &s;hrewdly inquired
if they had brought women with them. We
were not &s;atisfied, as to this colony.</P>
<P>We &s;aw, this day, Dundee and Aberbrothick,
the la&s;t of which Dr. John&s;on has celebrated in
his &startq;Journey.&endq; Upon the road we talked of
the Roman Catholick faith. He mentioned
(I think) Tillot&s;on's argument again&s;t tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation:
&startq;That we are as &s;ure we &s;ee bread
and wine only, as that we read in the Bible the
text on which that fal&s;e doctrine is founded.
We have only the evidence of our &s;en&s;es for
both.&endq; &startq;If (he added) GOD had never &s;poken
&s;iguratively, we might hold that he &s;peaks lite|rally,
when he &s;ays,&endq; &startq;This is my body.&endq;&mdash;
<PB N="70" REF="76">
<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;But what do you &s;ay, Sir, to the an|cient
and continued tradition of the church
upon this point?&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Tradition, Sir,
has no place, where the Scriptures are plain;
and tradition cannot per&s;uade a man into a be|lief
of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. Able men, indeed,
have <HI>&s;aid</HI> they believed it.&endq;</P>
<P>This is an awful &s;ubject. I did not then
pre&s;s Dr. John&s;on upon it; nor &s;hall I now
enter upon a di&s;qui&s;ition concerning the import
of tho&s;e words uttered by our Saviour, which
had &s;uch an effect upon many of his di&s;ciples,
that they &startq;went back, and walked no more
with him.&endq; The Catechi&s;m and &s;olemn office
for Communion, in the Church of England,
maintain a my&s;terious belief in more than a
mere commemoration of the death of Chri&s;t,
by partaking of the elements of bread and
wine.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on put me in mind, that, at St. An|drew's,
I had defended my profe&s;&s;ion very well,
when the que&s;tion had again been &s;tarted,
Whether a Lawyer might hone&s;tly engage with
the fir&s;t &s;ide that offers him a fee? &startq;Sir (&s;aid
I) it was with your arguments again&s;t Sir Wil|liam
Forbes. But it was much that I could
wield the arms of Goliath.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;aid our judges had not gone deep in
literary property. I mentioned Lord Mon|boddo's
opinion, that if a man could get a
<PB N="71" REF="77">
work by heart, he might print it, as by &s;uch
an act the mind is exerci&s;ed.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No,
Sir; a man's repeating it no more makes it his
property, than a man may &s;ell a cow which he
drives home.&endq;&mdash;I &s;aid, printing an abridge|ment
of a work was allowed, which was only
cutting the horns and tail off the cow.&mdash;<HI>John|&s;on.</HI>
&startq;No, Sir; 'tis making the cow have a
calf.&endq;</P>
<P>About eleven at night we arrived at Mont|ro&s;e.
We found but a &s;orry inn, where I my|&s;elf
&s;aw another waiter put a lump of &s;ugar with
his fingers into Dr. John&s;on's lemonade, for
which he called him &startq;Ra&s;cal!&endq; It put me in
great glee that our landlord was an <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI>
I rallied the Doctor upon this, and he grew quiet.
Both Sir John Hawkins's and Dr. Burney's
Hi&s;tory of Mu&s;ick had then been adverti&s;ed.
I a&s;ked if this was not unlucky? Would not
they hurt one another?&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, Sir.
They will do good to one another. Some will
buy the one, &s;ome the other, and compare
them; and &s;o a talk is made about a thing, and
the books are &s;old.&endq;</P>
<P>He was angry at me for propo&s;ing to carry
lemons with us to Sky, that he might be &s;ure
to have his lemonade. &startq;Sir (&s;aid he) I do not
wi&s;h to be thought that feeble man who cannot
do without any thing. Sir, it is very bad
manners to carry provi&s;ions to any man's hou&s;e,&endq;
<PB N="72" REF="78">
&startq;as if he could not entertain you. To an infe|riour,
it is oppre&s;&s;ive; to a &s;uperiour, it is in|&s;olent.&endq;</P>
<P>Having taken the liberty, this evening, to
remark to Dr. John&s;on, that he very often &s;at
quite &s;ilent for a long time, even when in com|pany
with only a &s;ingle friend, which I my&s;elf
had &s;ometimes &s;adly experienced, he &s;miled and
&s;aid, &startq;It is true, Sir. <HI>Tom Tyers</HI> (for &s;o he
familiarly called our ingenious friend, who,
&s;ince his death, has paid a biographical tribute
to his memory) <HI>Tom Tyers</HI> de&s;cribed me the

<P>Neither the Rev. Mr. Ni&s;bet, the e&s;tabli&s;hed
mini&s;ter, nor the Rev. Mr. Spooner, the epi&s;|copal
mini&s;ter, were in town. Before breakfa&s;t,
we went and &s;aw the town-hall, where is a good
dancing-room, and other rooms for tea-drinking.
The appearance of the town from it is very
well, only many of the hou&s;es are built with
their ends to the &s;treet, which looks aukward.
When we came down from it, I met Mr. Gleg,
the merchant here. He went with us to &s;ee
the Engli&s;h chapel. It is &s;ituated on a pretty
dry &s;pot, and there is a fine walk to it. It is
really an elegant building, both within and
<PB N="73" REF="79">
without. The organ is adorned with green and
gold. Dr. John&s;on gave a &s;hilling extraordi|nary
to the clerk, &s;aying, &startq;He belongs to an
hone&s;t church.&endq; I put him in mind, that epi&s;|copals
were but <HI>di&s;&s;enters</HI> here; they were only
<HI>tolerated.</HI> &startq;Sir (&s;aid he) we are here, as Chri&s;|tians
in Turkey.&endq; Dr. John&s;on went into an
apothecary's, and ordered &s;ome medicine for

characters. The boy took him for a phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>I doubted much which road to take, whether
to go by the coa&s;t, or by Laurence Kirk and
Monboddo. I knew Lord Monboddo and Dr.
John&s;on did not love each other; yet I was
unwilling not to vi&s;it his lord&s;hip; and was

<P>As we travelled onwards from Montro&s;e, we
had the Grampion hills in our view, and &s;ome
good land around us, but clear of trees and
hedges. Dr. John&s;on has &s;aid ludicrou&s;ly, in
his &startq;Journey,&endq; that the <HI>hedges</HI> were of <HI>&s;tone;</HI> for,
in&s;tead of the verdant <HI>thorn</HI> to refre&s;h the eye,
we found the bare wall or <HI>dike</HI> inter&s;ecting the
pro&s;pect. He ob&s;erved, that it was wonderful
to &s;ee a country &s;o dive&s;ted, &s;o denuded of
trees.</P>
<P>We &s;topped at Laurence Kirk, where our
great grammarian, Ruddiman, was once
&s;choolma&s;ter. We re&s;pectfully remembered
that excellent man and eminent &s;cholar, by
who&s;e labours a knowledge of the Latin lan|guage
will be pre&s;erved in Scotland, if it &s;hall
be pre&s;erved at all. Lord Garden&s;ton, one of
our judges, collected money to rai&s;e a monu|ment
to him at this place, which I hope will
be well executed. I know my father gave five
guineas towards it. Lord Garden&s;ton is the
proprietor of Laurence Kirk, and has encou|raged
<PB N="75" REF="81">
the building of a manufacturing village,
of which he is exceedingly fond, and has
written a pamphlet upon it, as if he had
founded Thebes; in which, however, there are
many u&s;eful precepts &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed. The
village &s;eemed to be irregularly built, &s;ome of
the hou&s;es being of clay, &s;ome of brick, and
&s;ome of brick and &s;tone. Dr. John&s;on ob|&s;erved,
they thatched well here.</P>
<P>I was a little acquainted with Mr. Forbes,
the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h. I &s;ent to inform
him that a gentleman de&s;ired to &s;ee him. He
returned for an&s;wer, &startq;that he would not come
to a &s;tranger.&endq; I then gave my name, and he
came. I remon&s;trated to him for not coming
to a &s;tranger; and, by pre&s;enting him to Dr.
John&s;on, proved to him what a &s;tranger might
&s;ometimes be. His Bible inculcates &startq;he not
forgetful to entertain &s;trangers,&endq; and mentions
the &s;ame motive. He defended him&s;elf by &s;ay|ing,
&startq;He had once come to a &s;tranger who
&s;ent for him; and he found him&endq; &startq;a <HI>little-worth
per&s;on!</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on in&s;i&s;ted on &s;topping at the inn,
as I told him that Lord Garden&s;ton had fur|ni&s;hed
it with a collection of books, that travel|lers
might have entertainment for the mind, as
well as the body. He prai&s;ed the de&s;ign, but

better cho&s;en.</P>

About a mile from Monboddo, where you
turn off the road, Jo&s;eph was waiting to tell us
my lord expected us to dinner. We drove over
a wild moor. It rained, and the &s;cene was
&s;omewhat dreary. Dr. John&s;on repeated, with
&s;olemn empha&s;is, Macbeth's &s;peech on meeting
the witches. As we travelled on, he told me,
&startq;Sir, you got into our club by doing what a

<P>Monboddo is a wretched place, wild and
naked, with a poor old hou&s;e; though, if I re|collect
right, there are two turrets which mark
an old baron's re&s;idence. Lord Monboddo re|ceived
us at his gate mo&s;t courteou&s;ly; pointed
<PB N="77" REF="83">
to the Douglas arms upon his hou&s;e, and told
us that his great-grandmother was of that fa|mily.

no, my lord (&s;aid Dr. John&s;on). We are as
&s;trong as they, and a great deal wi&s;er.&endq;&mdash;This
was an a&s;&s;ault upon one of Lord Monboddo's
capital dogmas, and I was afraid there would
have been a violent altercation in the very clo&s;e.
before we got into the hou&s;e. But his lord&s;hip
is di&s;tingui&s;hed not only for &startq;ancient meta|phy&s;icks,&endq;
but for ancient <HI>polite&s;&s;e, &startq;la vieille

wore a little round hat; told us, we now &s;aw

family dinner, a farmer's dinner. He &s;aid,
&startq;I &s;hould not have forgiven Mr. Bo&s;well, had

certainly a practical one.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;It does
not always follow, my lord, that a man who
has written a good poem on an art, has prac|ti&s;ed
it. Philip Miller told me, that in Philips's
Cyder, a poem, all the precepts were ju&s;t, and
indeed better than in books written for the pur|po&s;e

&startq;And it is that little which makes hi&s;tory va|luable.&endq;
&mdash;Bravo! thought I; they agree like
two brothers.&mdash;<HI>Monboddo.</HI> &startq;I am &s;orry, Dr.

<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;My lord, I received great re&s;pect
and great kindne&s;s.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;He goes back
<PB N="80" REF="86">
to Edinburgh after our tour.&endq;&mdash;We talked of
the decrea&s;e of learning in Scotland, and of the
&startq;Mu&s;es Welcome.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Learning is
much decrea&s;ed in England, in my remem|brance.&endq;
&mdash;<HI>Monboddo.</HI> &startq;You, Sir, have lived to
&s;ee its decrea&s;e in England, I its extinction in
Scotland.&endq; However, I brought him to con|fe&s;s
that the High School of Edinburgh did
well.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Learning has decrea&s;ed in
England, becau&s;e learning will not do &s;o much
for a man as formerly. There are other ways of
getting preferment. Few bi&s;hops are now
made for their learning. To be a bi&s;hop, a
man mu&s;t be learned in a learned age&mdash;factious
in a factious age; but always of eminence.
Warburton is an exception; though his learn|ing
alone did not rai&s;e him. He was fir&s;t an
antagoni&s;t to Pope, and helped Theobald to
publi&s;h his Shak&s;peare; but, &s;eeing Pope the
ri&s;ing man&mdash;when Crou&s;az attacked his E&s;&s;ay
on Man, for &s;ome faults which it has, and &s;ome
which it has not, Warburton defended it in the
Review of that time. This brought him ac|quainted
with Pope, and he gained his friend|&s;hip.
Pope introduced him to Allen&mdash;Allen
married him to his niece: So, by Allen's inte|re&s;t
and his own, he was made a bi&s;hop. But
then his learning was the <HI>&s;ine qu&agrave; non:</HI> He
knew how to make the mo&s;t of it; but I do not
find by any di&s;hone&s;t means.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Monboddo.</HI> &startq;He
<PB N="81" REF="87">
is a great man.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Yes; he has great
knowledge&mdash;great power of mind. Hardly any
man brings greater variety of learning to bear
upon his point.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Monboddo.</HI> &startq;He is one of
the greate&s;t lights of your church.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Why? we are not &s;o &s;ure of his being very
friendly to us. He blazes, if you will; but
that is not always the &s;teadie&s;t light. <HI>Lowth</HI> is
another bi&s;hop who has ri&s;en by his learning.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on examined young <HI>Arthur,</HI> Lord
Monboddo's &s;on, in Latin. He an&s;wered very
well; upon which he &s;aid, with complacency,
&startq;Get you gone! When King James comes
back, you &s;hall be in the Mu&s;es Welcome!&endq;
&mdash;My lord and Dr. John&s;on di&s;puted a little,
whether the Savage or the London Shopkeeper
had the be&s;t exi&s;tence; his lord&s;hip, as u&s;ual,
preferring the Savage. My lord was as ho&s;|pitable
as I could have wi&s;hed, and I &s;aw both
Dr. John&s;on and him liking each other better
every hour.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on having retired for a &s;hort time,
my lord &s;poke of his conver&s;ation as I could
have wi&s;hed. Dr. John&s;on had &s;aid, &startq;I have
done greater feats with my knife than this;&endq;
though he had taken a very hearty dinner.&mdash;
My lord, who affects or believes he follows an
ab&s;temious &s;y&s;tem, &s;eemed &s;truck with Dr.
John&s;on's manner of living. I had a particular
&s;atisfaction in being under the roof of <HI>Monboddo,</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="88">
my lord being my father's old friend, and having
been always very good to me. We were cor|dial
together. He a&s;ked Dr. John&s;on and me
to &s;tay all night. When I &s;aid we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be at
Aberdeen, he replied, &startq;Well, I am like the Ro|mans:
I &s;hall &s;ay to you,&endq; &startq;Happy to come&mdash;
happy to depart!&endq; He thanked Dr. John&s;on
for his vi&s;it.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq; I little thought, when
I had the honour to meet your lord&s;hip in
London, that I &s;hould &s;ee you at Monboddo.&endq;
&mdash;After dinner, as the ladies were going away,
Dr. John&s;on would &s;tand up. He in&s;i&s;ted that
politene&s;s was of great con&s;equence in &s;ociety.
&startq;It is (&s;aid he) fictitious benevolence.&endq; It
&s;upplies the place of it among&s;t tho&s;e who &s;ee
each other only in publick, or but little. Depend
upon it, the want of it never fails to produce
&s;omething di&s;agreeable to one or other. I have
always applied to good breeding, what Addi&s;on
in his Cato &s;ays of Honour,</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Honour's a &s;acred tie; the law of Kings;</L>
<L>The noble mind's di&s;tingui&s;hing perfection,</L>
<L>That aids and &s;trengthens Virtue where it meets her,</L>
<L>And imitates her actions where &s;he is not.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>When he took up his large oak &s;tick, he
&s;aid, &startq;My lord, that's <HI>homerick;&endq;</HI> thus plea|&s;antly
alluding to his lord&s;hip's favourite writer.
<HI>Gory,</HI> my lord's black &s;ervant, was &s;ent as our
guide &s;o far. This was another point of &s;imi|larity
<PB N="83" REF="89">
between John&s;on and Monboddo. I ob|&s;erved
how curious it was to &s;ee an African in
the north of Scotland, with little or no diffe|rence
of manners from tho&s;e of the natives.
Dr. John&s;on laughed to &s;ee Gory and Jo&s;eph
riding together mo&s;t cordially. &startq;Tho&s;e two
fellows, (&s;aid he) one from Africa, the other
from Bohemia, &s;eem quite at home.&endq;&mdash;He was
much plea&s;ed with Lord Monboddo to-day.
He &s;aid, he would have pardoned him for a few
paradoxes, when he found he had &s;o much that
was good. But that, from his appearance in
London, he thought him all paradox, which
would not do.&endq;&mdash;He ob&s;erved, that his lord&s;hip
had talked no paradoxes to-day. &startq;And as to
the &s;avage and the London &s;hopkeeper (&s;aid
he) I don't know but I might have taken the
&s;ide of the &s;avage equally, had any body el&s;e
taken the &s;ide of the &s;hopkeeper.&endq;&mdash;He had
&s;aid to my lord, in oppo&s;ition to the value of
the &s;avage's courage, that it was owing to his
limited power of thinking, and repeated Pope's
ver&s;es, in which &startq;Macedonia's mad-man&endq; is
introduced, and the conclu&s;ion is,
<Q><L>&startq;Yet ne'er looks forward farther than his no&s;e.&endq;</L></Q>
I objected to the la&s;t phra&s;e, as being low.&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, it is intended to be low: it is
&s;atyr. The expre&s;&s;ion is deba&s;ed, to deba&s;e the
character.&endq;</P>
<P>When Gory was about to part from us, Dr.
John&s;on called to him, &startq;Mr. Gory, give me leave
<PB N="84" REF="90">
to a&s;k you a que&s;tion!&endq; &startq;are you bapti&s;ed?&endq;
Gory told him he was&mdash;and confirmed by the
Bi&s;hop of Durham. He then gave him a &s;hil|ling.</P>
<P>We had te~dious driving this afternoon and
were a good deal drow&s;y. La&s;t night I was
afraid Dr. John&s;on was beginning to faint in
his re&s;olution; for he &s;aid &startq;If we mu&s;t ride
much, we &s;hall not go; and there's an end
on't.&endq;&mdash;To-day, when he talked of <HI>Sky</HI> with
&s;pirit, I &s;aid, &startq;Why, Sir, you &s;eemed to me
to de&s;pond ye&s;terday. You are a delicate Lon|doner
&mdash;You are a maccaroni! You can't ride.&endq;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, I &s;hall ride better than you. I
was only afraid I &s;hould not find a hor&s;e able
to carry me.&endq;&mdash;I hoped then there would be no
fear of getting through our wild Tour! We
came to Aberdeen at half an hour pa&s;t eleven.
The New Inn, we were told, was full. This was
comfortle&s;s. The waiter, however, a&s;ked if
one of our names was Bo&s;well, and brought
me a letter left at the inn. It was from Mr.
Thrale, enclo&s;ing one to Dr. John&s;on. Find|ing
who I was, we were told they would con|trive
to lodge us by putting us for a night into
a room with two beds. The waiter &s;aid to me
in the broad &s;trong Aberdeen&s;hire dialect, &startq;I
thought I knew you, by your likene&s;s to your
father.&endq;&mdash;My father puts up at the New Inn,
when on his circuit. Little was &s;aid to-night.
<PB N="85" REF="91">
I was to &s;leep in a little pre&s;s bed in Dr. John|&s;ons
room. I had it wheeled out into the
dining-room, and there I lay very well.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>22d Augu&s;t.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Profe&s;&s;or Thomas Gor|don,
who came and breakfa&s;ted with us. He
had &s;ecured &s;eats for us at the Engli&s;h chapel.
We found a re&s;pectable congregation, and an
admirable organ, well played by Mr. Tait.</P>
<P>We walked down to the &s;hore. Dr. John|&s;on
laughed to hear that Cromwell's &s;oldiers
taught the Aberdeen people to make &s;hoes and
&s;tockings, and to plant cabbages. He a&s;ked,
if weaving the plaids was ever a dome&s;tick art
in the Highlands, like &s;pinning or knitting.
He could not be informed here. But he con|jectured
probably, that where people lived &s;o
remote from each other it would be a dome&s;|tick
art, as we &s;ee it was among the ancients
from <HI>Penelope.</HI> I was &s;en&s;ible to day, to an ex|traordinary
degree, of Dr. John&s;on's excellent
Engli&s;h pronunciation. I cannot account for
its &s;triking me more now than any other
day: But it was as if new to me; and I li&s;ten|ed
to every &s;entence which he &s;poke, as to a
mu&s;ical compo&s;ition. Profe&s;&s;or Gordon gave
him an account of the plan of education in his
college. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, it was &s;imilar to
that at Oxford.&mdash;Waller the poet's great grand|&s;on
<PB N="86" REF="92">
was &s;tudying here. Dr. John&s;on wondered
that a man &s;hould &s;end his &s;on &s;o far off, when
there were &s;o many good &s;chools in England.
He &s;aid, &startq;At a great &s;chool there is all the
&s;plendour and illumination of many minds;
the radiance of all is concentrated in each, or
at lea&s;t reflected upon each. But we mu&s;t own
that neither a dull boy, nor an idle boy, will
do &s;o well at a great &s;chool as at a private one.
For at a great &s;chool there are always boys
enough to do well ea&s;ily, who are &s;ufficient to
keep up the credit of the &s;chool; and after
whipping being tried to no purpo&s;e, the dull or
idle boys are left at the end of a cla&s;s, having
the appearance of going through the cour&s;e, but
learning nothing at all. Such boys may do
good at a private &s;chool, where con&s;tant atten|tion
is paid to them, and they are watched.
So that the que&s;tion of publick or private edu|cation
is not properly a general one; but
whether one or the other is be&s;t for <HI>my &s;on.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>We were told this Mr. Waller was a
plain country gentleman; and his &s;on would be
&s;uch another. I ob&s;erved a family could not
expect a poet but in a hundred generations.&mdash;
&startq;Nay (&s;aid Dr. John&s;on) not one family in a
hundred can expect a poet in a hundred gene|rations.&endq;
He then repeated Dryden's cele|brated
lines,
<Q><L>Three poets in three di&s;tant ages born, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<PB N="87" REF="93">
and a part of a Latin tran&s;lation of it done at
Oxford<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><DATE>London, 2d May, 1778.</DATE>
<P>Dr. John&s;on acknowledged that he was him&s;elf the author of the tran&s;lation above alluded to, and dictated it to me as follows:</P>
<Q><L>Quos laudet vates Graius Romanus et Anglus</L>
<L>Tres tria temporibus &s;ecla dedere &s;uis.</L>
<L>Sublime ingenium Graius; Romanus habebat</L>
<L>Carmen grande &s;onans; Anglus utrumque tulit.</L>
<L>Nil majus Natura capit: clarare priores</L>
<L>Quae potuere duos tertius unus habet.</L></Q></NOTE>: he did not then &s;ay by whom.</P>
<P>He received a card from Sir Alexander Gor|don,
who had been his acquaintance twenty
years ago in London, and who, &startq;if forgiven
for not an&s;wering a line from him,&endq; would
come in the afternoon. Dr. John&s;on rejoiced
to hear of him, and begged he would come and
dine with us. I was much plea&s;ed to &s;ee the
kindne&s;s with which Dr. John&s;on received his
old friend Sir Alexander; a gentleman of good
family, <HI>Li&s;more,</HI> but who had not the e&s;tate.
The King's College here made him Profe&s;&s;or of
Medicine, which affords him a decent &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence.
He told us Aberdeen exported &s;tock|ings
to the value of a hundred thou&s;and pounds
in peace, and to one hundred and &s;eventy in
war. Dr. John&s;on a&s;ked, What made the dif|ference?
Here we had a proof of the different
&s;agacity of the two profe&s;&s;ors. Sir Alexander
an&s;wered, &startq;Becau&s;e there is more occa&s;ion for
them in war.&endq; Profe&s;&s;or Thomas an&s;wered,
<PB N="88" REF="94">
&startq;Becau&s;e the Germans, who are our great
rivals in the manufacture of &s;tockings, are
otherwi&s;e employed in time of war.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Sir, you have given a very good &s;olution.&endq;</P>
<P>At dinner, Dr. John&s;on eat &s;everal plate-fulls
of Scotch broth, with barley and peas in it, and
&s;eemed very fond of the di&s;h. I &s;aid, &startq;You
never eat it before.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, Sir; but
I don't care how &s;oon I eat it again.&endq;&mdash;My
cou&s;in, Mi&s;s Dallas, formerly of Inverne&s;s, was
married to Mr. Riddoch, one of the mini&s;ters
of the Engli&s;h chapel here. He was ill, and
confined to his room; but &s;he &s;ent us a kind in|vitation
to tea, which we all accepted She was
the &s;ame lively, &s;en&s;ible, cheerful woman, as
ever. Dr. John&s;on here threw out &s;ome jokes
again&s;t Scotland. He &s;aid, &startq;You go fir&s;t to
Aberdeen; then to <HI>Enbru</HI> (the Scots pronuncia|tion
of Edinburgh); then to Newca&s;tle, to be
poli&s;hed by the colliers; then to York; then
to London.&endq; And he laid hold of a little girl,
Stuart Dallas, niece to Mrs. Riddoch, and, re|pre&s;enting
him&s;elf as a giant, &s;aid, he would take
her with him! telling her, in a hollow voice,
that he lived in a cave, and had a bed in the
rock, and &s;he &s;hould have a little bed cut op|po&s;ite
to it!&punc;</P>
<P>He thus treated the point, as to pre&s;crip|tion
of murder in Scotland. &startq;A jury in
England would make allowance for deficiencies
of evidence,&endq; on account of lap&s;e of time; but
<PB N="89" REF="95">
a general rule that a crime &s;hould not be
puni&s;hed, or tried for the purpo&s;e of puni&s;h|ment,
after twenty years, is bad: It is
cant to talk of the King's advocate delaying a
pro&s;ecution from malice. How unlikely is it
the King's advocate &s;hould have malice again&s;t
people who commit murder, or &s;hould even
know them at all.&mdash;If the &s;on of the
murdered man &s;hould kill the murderer who
got off merely by pre&s;cription, I would help
him to make his e&s;cape; though, were I upon
his jury, I would not acquit him. I would not
advi&s;e him to commit &s;uch an act. On the con|trary,
I would bid him &s;ubmit to the determi|nation
of &s;ociety, becau&s;e a man is bound to
&s;ubmit to the inconveniences of it, as he enjoys
the good: but the young man, though politi|cally
wrong, would not be morally wrong. He
would have to &s;ay, &startq;Here I am among&s;t bar|barians,
who not only refu&s;e to do ju&s;tice, but
encourage the greate&s;t of all crimes. I am
therefore in a &s;tate of nature: for, &s;o far as
there is no law, it is a &s;tate of nature: and con|&s;equently,
upon the eternal and immutable law
of ju&s;tice, which requires that he who &s;heds
man's blood &s;hould have his blood &s;hed, I will
&s;tab the murderer of my father.&endq;</P>
<P>We went to our inn, and &s;at&punc; quietly. Dr.
John&s;on borrowed, at Mr. Riddoch's, a volume
of <HI>Ma&s;&s;illon's</HI> Di&s;cour&s;es on the P&s;alms. But I
found he read little in it. Ogden too he &s;ome|times
<PB N="90" REF="96">
took up, and glanced at; but threw it
down again. I then entered upon religious
conver&s;ation. Never did I &s;ee him in a better
frame: calm, gentle, wi&s;e, holy.&mdash;I &s;aid,
&startq;Would not the &s;ame objection hold again&s;t
the Trinity as again&s;t Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation?&endq;&mdash;
&startq;Yes, (&s;aid he) if you take three and one in the
&s;ame &s;en&s;e. If you do &s;o, to be &s;ure you cannot
believe it: but the three per&s;ons in the Godhead
are Three in one &s;en&s;e, and One in another.
We cannot tell how; and that is the my&s;tery!&endq;</P>
<P>I &s;poke of the &s;atisfaction of Chri&s;t. He &s;aid
his notion was, that it did not attone for the
&s;ins of the world; but, by &s;atisfying divine
ju&s;tice, by &s;hewing that no le&s;s than the Son of
God &s;uffered for &s;in, it &s;hewed to men and in|numerable
created beings, the heinou&s;ne&s;s of
it, and therefore rendered it unnece&s;&s;ary for
divine vengeance to be exerci&s;ed again&s;t &s;inners,
as it otherwi&s;e mu&s;t have been; that in this way
it might operate even in favour of tho&s;e who
had never heard of it: as to tho&s;e who did hear
of it, the effect it &s;hould produce would be re|pentance
and piety, by impre&s;&s;ing upon the
mind a ju&s;t notion of &s;in; that original &s;in was
the propen&s;ity to evil, which no doubt was
occa&s;ioned by the fall. He pre&s;ented this
&s;olemn &s;ubject in a new light to me<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">My worthy, intelligent, and candid friend, Dr. <HI>Kippis,</HI> informs me, that &s;everal divines have thus explained the me|diation of our Saviour. What Dr. John&s;on now delivered, was but a temporary opinion; for he afterwards was fully convinced of the <HI>propitiatory &s;acrifice,</HI> as I &s;hall &s;hew at large in my future work, &startq;THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, L. L. D.&endq;</NOTE>, and ren|dered
<PB N="91" REF="97">
much more rational and clear the doctrine
of what our Saviour has done for us;&mdash;as it re|moved
the notion of imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s in
co-operating, whereas by this view, Chri&s;t has
done all already that he had to do, or is ever
to do, for mankind, by making his great &s;atis|faction;
the con&s;equences of which will affect
each individual according to the particular
conduct of each. I would illu&s;trate this by
&s;aying, that Chri&s;t's &s;atisfaction re&s;embles a
&s;un placed to &s;hew light to men, &s;o that it de|pends
upon them&s;elves whether they will walk
the right way or not, which they could not have
done without that &s;un, &startq;<HI>the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&endq;
There is, however, more in it than merely
giving light&mdash;<HI>a light to lighten the Gentiles.</HI> For
we are told there is <HI>healing under his wings.</HI>
Dr. John&s;on &s;aid to me, &startq;Richard Baxter

Chri&s;ti.</HI> I have never read it: but I intend to
read it; and you may read it.&endq; I remarked, upon
the principle now laid down, we might explain
the difficult and &s;eemingly hard text, &startq;They
that believe &s;hall be &s;aved; and they that be|lieve
not &s;hall be damned:&endq; They that believe

<P>Principal Campbell, Sir Alexander Gordon,
Profe&s;&s;or Gordon, and Profe&s;&s;or Ro&s;s, vi&s;ited
us in the morning, as did Dr. Gerard, who had
come in &s;ix miles from the country on purpo&s;e.
We went and &s;aw the Mari&s;chal College<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Beattie was &s;o kindly entertained in England, that he had not yet returned home.</NOTE>, and
at one o'clock we waited on the magi&s;trates in
the town-hall, as they had invited us in order to
<PB N="93" REF="99">
pre&s;ent Dr. John&s;on with the freedom of the
town, which Provo&s;t Jopp did with a very good
grace. Dr. John&s;on was much plea&s;ed with
this mark of attention, and received it very
politely. There was a pretty numerous com|pany
a&s;&s;embled. It was &s;triking to hear all of
them drinking &startq;Dr. John&s;on!&endq; Dr. John&s;on!&punc;
in the town-hall of Aberdeen, and then to &s;ee
him with his burge&s;s-ticket, or diploma<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. John&s;on's burge&s;s-ticket was in the&s;e words:</P>

<Q>ALEX. CARNEGIE,&endq;</Q></NOTE> in his
hat, which he wore as he walked along the
&s;treet, according to the u&s;ual cu&s;tom.&mdash;It gave
me great &s;atisfaction to ob&s;erve the regard, and
indeed fondne&s;s too, which every body here
had for my father.</P>
<P>While Sir Alexander Gordon conducted
Dr. John&s;on to old Aberdeen, Profe&s;&s;or Gordon
and I called on Mr. Riddoch, whom I found
to be a grave worthy clergyman. He ob&s;erved,
that, whatever might be &s;aid of Dr. John&s;on
while he was alive, he would, after he was
<PB N="94" REF="100">
dead, be looked upon by the world with regard
and a&s;toni&s;hment, on account of his Dictionary.</P>
<P>Profe&s;&s;or Gordon and I walked over to the
Old College, which Dr. John&s;on had &s;een by
this time. I &s;tepped into the chapel, and
looked at the tomb of the founder, Archbi&s;hop
Elphin&s;ton, of whom I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to
write in my Hi&s;tory of James IV. of Scotland,
the patron of my family.</P>
<P>We dined at Sir Alexander Gordon's. The
Provo&s;t, Profe&s;&s;or Ro&s;s, Profe&s;&s;or Dunbar, Pro|fe&s;&s;or
Thomas Gordon, were there. After
dinner came in Dr. Gerard, Profe&s;&s;or Le&s;lie,
Profe&s;&s;or Macleod. We had had little or no
conver&s;ation in the morning; now we were but
barren. The profe&s;&s;ors &s;eemed afraid to &s;peak.</P>
<P>Dr. Gerard told us that an eminent printer
was very intimate with Warburton.&mdash;&startq;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
Why, Sir, he has printed &s;ome of his works,
and perhaps bought the property of &s;ome of
them. The intimacy is &s;uch as one of the
profe&s;&s;ors here may have with one of the car|penters
who is repairing the college.&endq;&mdash;&startq;But
(&s;aid <HI>Gerard)</HI> I &s;aw a letter from him to this
printer, in which he &s;ays, that the one half of
the clergy of the church of Scotland are fana|ticks,
and the other half infidels.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Warburton has accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to write
letters ju&s;t as he &s;peaks, without thinking any
more of what he throws out. When I read
<PB N="95" REF="101">
Warburton fir&s;t, and ob&s;erved his force, and
his contempt of mankind, I thought he had
driven the world before him; but I &s;oon
found that was not the ca&s;e; for Warburton,
by his extending his abu&s;e, rendered it inef|fectual.&endq;</P>
<P>He told me, when we were by our&s;elves,
that he thought it very wrong in the printer,
to &s;hew Warburton's letter, as it was rai&s;ing a
body of enemies again&s;t him. He thought it
fooli&s;h in Warburton to write &s;o to the printer;
and added, &startq;Sir, the wor&s;t way of being inti|mate,
is by &s;cribbling.&endq; He called Warbur|ton's
&startq;E&s;&s;ay on Grace&endq; a poor performance&punc;
and &s;o he &s;aid was We&s;ley's &startq;An&s;wer.&endq; &startq;War|burton,
he ob&s;erved, had laid him&s;elf very
open. In particular, he was weak enough to
&s;ay, that, in &s;ome di&s;orders of the imagination,
people had &s;poken with tongues, had &s;poken
with languages which they never knew before;
a thing as ab&s;urd as to &s;ay, that, in &s;ome di&s;|orders
of the imagination, people had been
known to fly.&endq;</P>
<P>I talked of the difference of genius, to try if
I could engage Gerard in a di&s;qui&s;ition with
Dr. John&s;on; but I did not &s;ucceed. I men|tioned,
as a curious fact, that Lock had written
ver&s;es.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on,</HI> &startq;I know of none, Sir, but a
kind of exerci&s;e prefixed to Dr. Sydenham's
Works, in which he has &s;ome conceits about
<PB N="96" REF="102">
the drop&s;y; in which water and burning are
united: and how Dr. Sydenham removed fire
by drawing off water, contrary to the u&s;ual
practice, which is to extingui&s;h fire by bringing
water upon it.&mdash;I am not &s;ure that there is a
word of all this; but it is &s;uch kind of talk<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">All this, as Dr. John&s;on &s;u&s;pected at the time, was the immediate invention of his own lively imagination; for there is not one word of it in Mr. Lock's complimentary per|formance. My readers will, I have no doubt, like to be &s;atisfied, by comparing them; and, at any rate, it may entertain to read ver&s;es compo&s;ed by our great metaphy&s;ician, when a Bachelor in Phy&s;ick.

We &s;poke of Fingal. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid
calmly, &startq;If the poems were really tran&s;lated,&endq;
they were certainly fir&s;t written down. Let
Mr. Macpher&s;on depo&s;it the manu&s;cript in one
of the colleges at Aberdeen, where there are
<PB N="98" REF="104">
people who can judge; and, if the profe&s;&s;ors
certify the authenticity, then there will be an
end of the controver&s;y. If he does not take
this obvious and ea&s;y method, he gives the be&s;t
rea&s;on to doubt; con&s;idering too, how much is
again&s;t it <HI>&agrave; priori.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;auntered after dinner in Sir Alexander's
garden, and &s;aw his little grotto, which is
hung with pieces of poetry written in a fair
hand. It was agreeable to ob&s;erve the content|ment
and kindne&s;s of this quiet, benevolent
man. Profe&s;&s;or Macleod was brother to Mac|leod
of Tali&s;ker, and brother-in-law to the
Laird of Coll. He gave me a letter to young
Coll. I was weary of this day, and began to
think wi&s;hfully of being again in motion. I
was unea&s;y to think my&s;elf too fa&s;tidious, whil&s;t
I fancied Dr. John&s;on quite &s;atisfied. But he
owned to me that he was fatigued and tea&s;ed,
by Sir Alexander's doing too much to entertain
him. I &s;aid, it was all kindne&s;s.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;True, Sir: but &s;en&s;ation is &s;en&s;ation.&endq;&mdash;
<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;It is &s;o: we feel pain equally from
the &s;urgeon's probe, as from the &s;word of the
foe.&endq;</P>
<P>We vi&s;ited two book&s;ellers' &s;hops, and could
not find Arthur John&s;ton's Poems. We went
and &s;at near an hour at Mr. Riddoch's. He
could not tell di&s;tinctly how much education at
the college here co&s;ts, which di&s;gu&s;ted Dr.
John&s;on. I had pledged my&s;elf that we &s;hould
<PB N="99" REF="105">
go to the inn, and not &s;tay &s;upper. They
pre&s;&s;ed us, but he was re&s;olute. I &s;aw Mr.
Riddoch did not plea&s;e him. He &s;aid to me,
afterwards, &startq;Sir, he has no vigour in his talk.&endq;
But my friend &s;hould have con&s;idered that he
him&s;elf was not in good humour; &s;o that it
was not ea&s;y to talk to his &s;atisfaction.&mdash;We
&s;at contentedly at our inn. He then became
merry, and ob&s;erved how little we had either
heard or &s;aid at Aberdeen. That the Aberdo|nians

<P>We &s;et out about eight in the morning,
and breakfa&s;ted at Ellon. The landlady &s;aid to
me, &startq;Is not this the great Doctor that is going
about through the country?&endq;&mdash;I &s;aid, &startq;Yes.&endq;
&mdash;&startq;Aye, (&s;aid &s;he) we heard of him, I made
an errand into the room on purpo&s;e to &s;ee him.
There's &s;omething great in his appearance. It
is a plea&s;ure to have &s;uch a man in one's hou&s;e;
a man who does &s;o much good. If I had
thought of it, I would have &s;hewn him a child
of mine who has had a lump on his throat for
&s;ome time.&endq;&mdash;&startq;But (&s;aid I) he is not a doctor of
phy&s;ick.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Is he an oculi&s;t?&endq; &s;aid the
landlord.&mdash;&startq;No, (&s;aid I) he is only a
very learned man.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Landlord.</HI> &startq;They &s;ay
<PB N="100" REF="106">
he is the greate&s;t man in England, except
Lord Mansfield.&endq;&mdash;Dr. John&s;on was highly en|tertained
with this, and I do think he was
plea&s;ed too. He &s;aid, &startq;I like the exception:
to have called me the greate&s;t man in England,
would have been an unmeaning compliment.
But the exception marked that the prai&s;e was in
earne&s;t; and, in Scotland, the exception mu&s;t
be <HI>Lord Mansfield,</HI> or&mdash;<HI>Sir John Pringle.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>He told me a good &s;tory of Dr. Gold&s;mith.
Graham, who wrote &startq;Telemachus, a Ma&s;que,&endq;
was &s;itting one night with him and Dr. John|&s;on,
and was half drunk. He rattled away
to Dr. John&s;on: &startq;You are a clever fellow, to
be &s;ure; but you cannot write an e&s;&s;ay like
Addi&s;on, or ver&s;es like the <HI>Rape of the Lock.</HI>&endq;
At la&s;t he &s;aid, &startq;<HI>Doctor,</HI> I &s;hould be happy to
&s;ee you at Eaton.&endq;&mdash;&startq;I &s;hall be glad to wait on
you,&endq; an&s;wered Gold&s;mith.&mdash;&startq;No (&s;aid Gra|ham)
'tis not you I meant, Dr. <HI>Minor;</HI> 'tis Dr.
<HI>Major,</HI> there.&endq;&mdash;Gold&s;mith was exce&s;&s;ively
hurt by this. He afterwards &s;poke of it him|&s;elf.
&startq;Graham (&s;aid he) is a fellow to make one
commit &s;uicide.&endq;</P>
<P>We had received a polite invitation to Slains
ca&s;tle. We arrived there ju&s;t at three o'clock,
as the bell for dinner was ringing. Though,
from its being ju&s;t on the North-ea&s;t Ocean, no
trees will grow here, Lord Errol has done all
that can be done. He has cultivated his fields
<PB N="101" REF="107">
&s;o as to bear rich crops of every kind, and he
has made an excellent kitchen-garden, with a
hot-hou&s;e. I had never &s;een any of the family.
But there had been a card of invitation written
by the honourable Charles Boyd, the earl's
brother. We were conducted into the hou&s;e,
and at the dining-room door were met by that
gentleman, whom both of us at fir&s;t took to be
Lord Errol; but he &s;oon corrected our mi&s;take.
My lord was gone to dine in the neighbour|hood,
at an entertainment given by Mr. Irvine
of Drum. Lady Errol received us politely,
and was very attentive to us during the time of
dinner. There was nobody at table but her
lady&s;hip, Mr. Boyd, and &s;ome of the children,
their governor and governe&s;s. Mr. Boyd put
Dr. John&s;on in mind of having dined with him
at Cummin the Quaker's, along with a Mr.
Hall and Mi&s;s Williams. This was a bond of
connection between them. For me, Mr. Boyd's
acquaintance with my father was enough. After
dinner, Lady Errol favoured us with a &s;ight of
her young family, whom &s;he made &s;tand up in
a row. There were &s;ix daughters and two &s;ons.
It was a very plea&s;ing &s;ight.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on propo&s;ed our &s;etting out. Mr.
Boyd &s;aid, he hoped we &s;hould &s;tay all night;
his brother would be at home in the evening,
and would be very &s;orry if he mi&s;&s;ed us. Mr.
Boyd was called out of the room. I was very
<PB N="102" REF="108">
de&s;irous to &s;tay in &s;o comfortable a hou&s;e, and
I wi&s;hed to &s;ee Lord Errol. Dr. John&s;on, how|ever,
was right in re&s;olving to go, if we were
not a&s;ked again, as it is be&s;t to err on the &s;afe
&s;ide in &s;uch ca&s;es, and to be &s;ure that one is
quite welcome. To my great joy, when Mr.
Boyd returned, he told Dr. John&s;on that it was
Lady Errol who had called him out, and &s;aid
that &s;he would never let Dr. John&s;on into the
hou&s;e again, if he went away that night; and
that &s;he had ordered the coach, to carry us to
view a great curio&s;ity on the coa&s;t, after which
we &s;hould &s;ee the hou&s;e. We cheerfully agreed.</P>
<P>Mr. Boyd was engaged, in 1745-6, on the
&s;ame &s;ide with many unfortunate mi&s;taken no|blemen
and gentlemen. He e&s;caped, and lay
concealed for a year in the i&s;land of Arran, the
ancient territory of the Boyds. He then went
to France, and was about twenty years on the
continent. He married a French Lady, and
now lived very comfortably at Aberdeen, and
was much at Slains ca&s;tle. He entertained us
with great civility. He had a pompou&s;ne&s;s or
formal plenitude in his conver&s;ation, which I
did not di&s;like. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;there
was too much elaboration in his talk.&endq; It gave
me plea&s;ure to &s;ee him, a &s;teady branch of the
family, &s;etting forth all its advantages with much
zeal. He told us that Lady Errol was one of the
mo&s;t pious and &s;en&s;ible women in the i&s;land;
<PB N="103" REF="109">
had a good head, and as good a heart. He
&s;aid, &s;he did not u&s;e force or fear in educating
her children&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, &s;he is wrong; I
would rather have the rod to be the general
terror to all, to make them learn, than tell a
child, if you do thus or thus, you will be more
e&s;teemed than your brothers or &s;i&s;ters. The rod
produces an effect which terminates in it&s;elf.
A child is afraid of being whipt, and gets his
ta&s;k, and there's an end on't; whereas, by ex|citing
emulation, and compari&s;ons of &s;uperio|rity,
you lay the foundation of la&s;ting mi&s;chief;
you make brothers and &s;i&s;ters hate each other.&endq;</P>
<P>During Mr. Boyd's &s;tay in Arran, he had
found a che&s;t of medical books, left by a &s;ur|geon
there, and had read them till he acquired
&s;ome &s;kill in phy&s;ick, in con&s;equence of which
he is often con&s;ulted by the poor. There were
&s;everal here waiting for him as patients. We
walked round the hou&s;e till &s;topped by a cut
made by the influx of the &s;ea. The hou&s;e is
built quite upon the &s;hore; the windows look
upon the main ocean, and the King of Den|mark
is Lord Errol's neare&s;t neighbour on the
north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>We got immediately into the coach, and
drove to <HI>Dunbui,</HI> a rock near the &s;hore, quite
covered with &s;ea fowls; then to a circular ba&s;on
of large extent, &s;urrounded with tremendous
rocks. On the quarter next the &s;ea; there is a
<PB N="104" REF="110">
high arch in the rock, which the force of the
tempe&s;t has driven out. This place is called
<HI>Buchan's Buller,</HI> or the <HI>Buller</HI> of <HI>Buchan,</HI> and
the country people call it the <HI>Pot.</HI> Mr. Boyd
&s;aid it was &s;o called from the French <HI>Bouloir.</HI>
It may be more &s;imply traced from <HI>Boiler</HI> in
our own language. We walked round this
mon&s;trous cauldron. In &s;ome places, the rock
is very narrow; and on each &s;ide there is a
&s;ea deep enough for a man of war to ride in;
&s;o that it is &s;omewhat horrid to move along.
However, there is earth and gra&s;s upon the
rock, and a kind of road marked out by the
print of feet; &s;o that one makes it out pretty
&s;afely: yet it alarmed me to &s;ee Dr. John&s;on
&s;triding irregularly along. He in&s;i&s;ted on taking
a boat, and &s;ailing into the Pot. We did &s;o.
He was &s;tout, and wonderfully alert. The
Buchan-men all &s;hewing their teeth, and &s;peak|ing
with that &s;trange &s;harp accent which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
them, was to me a matter of curio&s;ity.
He was not &s;en&s;ible of the difference of pro|nunciation
in the South, and North of Scot|land,
which I wondered at.</P>
<P>As the entry into the <HI>Buller</HI> is &s;o narrow that
oars cannot be u&s;ed as you go in, the method
taken is, to row very hard when you come near
it, and give the boat &s;uch a rapidity of motion
that it glides in. Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved what
an effect this &s;cene would have had, were we
<PB N="105" REF="111">
entering into an unknown place. There are
caves of con&s;iderable depth; I think, one on
each &s;ide. The boatmen had never entered
either far enough to know the &s;ize. Mr. Boyd
told us that it is cu&s;tomary for the company at
Peterhead well, to make parties, and come
and dine in one of the caves here.</P>
<P>He told us, that, as Slains is at a con&s;ider|able
di&s;tance from Aberdeen, Lord Errol, who
has &s;o large a family, re&s;olved to have a &s;urgeon
of his own. With this view he educated one of
his tenants' &s;ons, who is now &s;ettled in a very
neat hou&s;e and farm ju&s;t by, which we &s;aw
from the road. By the &s;alary which the earl
allows him, and the practice which he has had,
he is in very ea&s;y circum&s;tances. He had kept
an exact account of all that had been laid out
on his education, and he came to his lord&s;hip
one day, and told him that he had arrived at a
much higher &s;ituation than ever he expected;
that he was now able to repay what his lord&s;hip
had advanced, and begged he would accept of
it. The earl was plea&s;ed with the generous
gratitude and genteel offer of the man; but re|fu&s;ed
it.&mdash;Mr. Boyd al&s;o told us, Cumming the
Quaker fir&s;t began to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf, by
writing again&s;t Dr. Leechman on Prayer, to
prove it unnece&s;&s;ary, as God knows be&s;t what
&s;hould be, and will order it without our a&s;k|ing:
&mdash;the old hackneyed objection.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="112">
When we returned to the hou&s;e we found
coffee and tea in the drawing room. Lady
Errol was not there, being, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, en|gaged
with her young family. There is a bow-window
fronting the &s;ea. Dr. John&s;on repeated
the ode, <HI>Jam &s;atis terris,</HI> while Mr. Boyd was
with his patients. He &s;poke well in favour of
entails, to pre&s;erve lives of men whom mankind
are accu&s;tomed to reverence. His opinion was,
that &s;o much land &s;hould be entailed as that
families &s;hould never fall into contempt, and as
much left free as to give them all the advan|tages
of property in ca&s;e of any emergency.
&startq;If (&s;aid he) the nobility are &s;uffered to &s;ink
into indigence, they of cour&s;e become cor|rupt;
they are ready to do whatever the king
chu&s;es; therefore it is fit they &s;hould be kept
from becoming poor, unle&s;s it is fixed that
when they fall below a certain &s;tandard of
wealth they &s;hall lo&s;e their peerages. We
know the Hou&s;e of Peers have made noble
&s;tands, when the Hou&s;e of Commons dur&s;t
not. The two la&s;t years of a parliament they
dare not contradict the populace.&endq;</P>
<P>This room is ornamented with a number of
fine prints, and with a whole length picture of
Lord Errol, by Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds. This
led Dr. John&s;on and me to talk of our amiable
and elegant friend, who&s;e panegyrick he con|cluded
by &s;aying, &startq;Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, Sir,
is the mo&s;t invulnerable man I know; the man
<PB N="107" REF="113">
$ith whom, if you &s;hould quarrel, you would
$nd the mo&s;t difficulty how to abu&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved, the &s;ituation here was
$word$ noble&s;t he had ever &s;een,&mdash;better than
$lount Edgecumbe, reckoned the fir&s;t in
$ngland; becau&s;e, at Mount Edgecumbe, the
$word$ is bounded by land on the other &s;ide, and,
$ough there is there the grandeur of a fleet,
$$ere is al&s;o the impre&s;&s;ion of there being a
$ock-yard, the circum&s;tances of which are
$ot agreeable. At Slains is an excellent old
$ou&s;e. The noble owner has built of brick,
$ong the &s;quare in the in&s;ide, a gallery both
$n the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;tory, the hou&s;e being
$o highter; &s;o that he has always a dry
$alk; and the rooms, to which formerly there
$as no approach but through each other, have
$ow all &s;eparate entries from the gallery, which
$word$ hung with Hogarth's works, and other prints.
We went and &s;at a while in the library. There
$s a valuable and numerous collection. It was
$hiefly made by Mr. Falconer, hu&s;band to the
$ate Counte&s;s of Errol in her own right. This
$arl has added a good many modern books.</P>
<P>About nine the earl came home. Captain
Gordon of Park was with him. His lord&s;hip
$ut Dr. John&s;on in mind of their dining toge|$her
in London, along with Mr. Beauclerk. I
was exceedingly plea&s;ed with Lord Errol. His
&s;ignified per&s;on and agreeable countenance,
with the mo&s;t unaffected affability, gave me high
<PB N="108" REF="114">
&s;atisfaction. From perhaps a weakne&s;s, or, a
I rather hope, more fancy and warmth $word$
feeling than is quite rea&s;onable, I could, wit$
the mo&s;t perfect hone&s;ty, expatiate on $word$
Errol's good qualities; but he &s;tands in n$
need of my prai&s;e. His agreeable look an$
&s;oftne&s;s of addre&s;s prevented that con&s;train
which the idea of his being Lord Hig$
Con&s;table of Scotland might otherwi&s;e hav$
occa&s;ioned. He talked very ea&s;ily and &s;en$&s;ibly
with his learned gue&s;t. I ob&s;erve$
that Dr. John&s;on, though he &s;hewed tha$
re&s;pect to his lord&s;hip, which, from principle
he always does to high rank, yet, when they
came to argument, maintained that manline&s;$
which becomes the force and vigour of hi$
under&s;tanding. To &s;hew external deference to
our &s;uperiors, is proper: to &s;eem to yield to

The fencing-ma&s;ter, who&s;e fame and bread were at &s;take, put out one of his lord&s;hip's eyes. Exa&s;perated at this, Lord Sanquhar hired ruffians, and had the fencing-ma&s;ter a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; for which his lord&s;hip was capitally tried, condemned, and hanged. Not being a peer of England, he was tried by the name of Robert Crichton, E&s;&abque; But he was admitted to be a baron of three hundred years &s;tanding.&mdash;See the State Trials; and Hume in his Hi&s;tory, who applauds the impartial ju&s;tice executed upon a man of high rank.</NOTE>. The earl &s;ai$

executed at Perth, &s;ome years ago, for mur|$$ering
a woman who was with child by him,
and a former child he had by her. His hand
was cut off: He was then pulled up; but the

$on the ground, till another rope was brought
from Perth, the execution being in a wood at

<P>We got up between &s;even and eight, an$
found Mr. Boyd in the dining-room, with te$
and coffee before him, to give us breakfa&s;t
We were in an admirable humour. Lady
Errol had given each of us a copy of an ode by
Beattie, on the birth of her &s;on, Lord Hay
Mr. Boyd a&s;ked Dr. John&s;on how he liked it
Dr. John&s;on, who did not admire it, got off very
well, by taking it out, and reading the two
&s;econd &s;tanzas with much melody. This
without his &s;aying a word, plea&s;ed Mr. Boyd&punc;
He ob&s;erved, however, to Dr. John&s;on, that
the expre&s;&s;ion as to the family of Errol,</P>
<Q><L>&startq;A thou&s;and years have &s;een it &s;hine,&endq;</L></Q>
<PB N="111" REF="117">
<P>compared with what went before, was an anti|climax,
and that it would have been better
<Q><L>Ages have &s;een, &amp;c.</L></Q>
Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;So great a number as a
thou&s;and is better. <HI>Dolus latet in univer&s;alibus.</HI>
Ages might be only two ages.&endq;&mdash;He talked of
the advantage of keeping up the connections of
relation&s;hip, which produce much kindne&s;s.
&startq;Every man (&s;aid he) who comes into the
world, has need of friends. If he has to get
them for him&s;elf, half his life is &s;pent, before
his merit is known. Relations are a man's
ready friends, who &s;upport him. When a man
is in real di&s;tre&s;s, he flies into the arms of his
relations. An old lawyer, who had much expe|rience
in making wills, told me, that after
people had deliberated long, and thought of
many for their executors, they &s;ettled at la&s;t
by fixing on their relations. This &s;hews the
univer&s;ality of the principle.&endq;</P>
<P>I regretted the decay of re&s;pect for men of
family, and that a Nabob now would carry an
election from them&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why, Sir, the
Nabob will carry it by means of his wealth, in
a country where money is highly valued, as it
mu&s;t be where nothing can be had without
money; but if it comes to per&s;onal preference,
the man of family will always carry it. There
is generally a <HI>&s;coundreli&s;m</HI> about a low man.&endq;
&mdash;Mr. Boyd &s;aid, that was a good <HI>i&s;m.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="118">
I &s;aid, I believed mankind were happier in
the ancient feudal &s;tate of &s;ubordination, than
when in the modern &s;tate of independency.&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;To be &s;ure, the <HI>Chief</HI> was. But we
mu&s;t think of the number of individuals. That
<HI>they</HI> were le&s;s happy, &s;eems plain; for that &s;tate
from which all e&s;cape as &s;oon as they can, and
to which none return after they have left it,
mu&s;t be le&s;s happy; and this is the ca&s;e with
the &s;tate of dependance on a chief, or great
man.&endq;</P>
<P>I mentioned the happine&s;s of the French in
their &s;ubordination, by the reciprocal benevo|lence
and attachment between the great and
tho&s;e in lower ranks.&mdash;Mr. Boyd gave us an
in&s;tance of their gentlemanly &s;pirit. An
old <HI>Chevalier de Malthe,</HI> of ancient <HI>noble&s;&s;e,</HI> but
in low circum&s;tances, was in a coffee-hou&s;e at
Paris, where was <HI>Julien,</HI> the great manufacturer
at the Gobelins, of the fine tape&s;try, &s;o much
di&s;tingui&s;hed both for the figures and the <HI>colours.</HI>
The chevalier's carriage was very old. Says
Julien, with a plebeian in&s;olence, &startq;I think,
Sir, you had better have your carriage new
painted.&endq; The chevalier looked at him with
indignant contempt, and an&s;wered, &startq;Well,
Sir, you may take it home and <HI>dye</HI> it!&endq;&mdash;All
the coffee-hou&s;e rejoiced at Julien's confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>We &s;et out about nine. Dr. John&s;on was
curious to &s;ee one of tho&s;e &s;tructures which
<PB N="113" REF="119">
northern antiquarians call a Druid's temple.
I had a recollection of one at Strichen, which
I had &s;een fifteen years ago; &s;o we went four
miles out of our road, after pa&s;&s;ing Old Deer,
and went thither. Mr. Fra&s;er, the proprietor,
was at home, and &s;hewed it to us. But I had
augmented it in my mind; for all that remains
is two &s;tones &s;et up on end, with a long one
laid upon them, as was u&s;ual, and one &s;tone
at a little di&s;tance from them. That &s;tone was
the capital one of the circle which &s;urrounded
what now remains. Mr. Fra&s;er was very ho&s;pi|table
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He is the worthy &s;on of a worthy father, the late Lord <HI>Strichen,</HI> one of our judges, to who&s;e kind notice I was much obliged.

Let me here, for the credit of <HI>Ayr&s;hire,</HI> my own county, record a noble in&s;tance of liberal hone&s;ty in <HI>William Hutchi&s;on,</HI> drover, in Lanehead, <HI>Kyle,</HI> who formerly obtained a full di&s;charge from his credi|tors, upon a compo&s;ition of his debts; but, upon being re&s;tored to good circum&s;tances, invited his creditors la&s;t winter to a dinner, without telling the rea&s;on, and paid them their full &s;ums, principal and intere&s;t. They pre&s;ented him with a piece of plate, with an in&s;cription to commemorate this extraordinary in&s;tance of true worth; which &s;hould make &s;ome people in Scotland blu&s;h, while, though mean them&s;elves, they &s;trut about under the protection of great alliance, con&s;cious of the wretchedne&s;s of numbers who have lo&s;t by them, to whom they never think of making reparation, but indulge them&s;elves and their families in mo&s;t un&s;uitable expence.</NOTE>.

One of them, Dr. Fra&s;er, who had been in the
army, remembred to have &s;een Dr. John&s;on at

&s;omebody who knew him.</P>
<P>Mr. Fra&s;er &s;ent a &s;ervant to conduct us by a
&s;hort pa&s;&s;age into the high road. I ob&s;erved to
Dr. John&s;on, that I had a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable no|tion
of the life of country gentlemen: that
I left Mr. Fra&s;er ju&s;t now, as one leaves a pri|&s;oner

right in thinking them unhappy; for that they
had not enough to keep their minds in motion.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted a thought this afternoon which
amu&s;ed us a great part of the way. &startq;If

&s;pirit of this project. We immediately fell to
di&s;tributing the offices. I was to teach civil
and Scotch law; Burke, politicks and elo|quence;
Garrick, the art of public &s;peaking;
Langton was to be our Grecian, Colman our

&startq;for (&s;aid he) what can he do in farming by

John&s;on mi&s;taken. He who wi&s;hes to be &s;uc|ce&s;sful,
or happy, ought to be enthu&s;ia&s;tical,
that is to &s;ay, very keen in all the occupations

will have his mind earne&s;tly engaged;&mdash;will
talk perpetually of them. But Dr. John&s;on
has much of the <HI>nil admirari</HI> in &s;maller con|cerns.

<P>Mr. Robert&s;on &s;ent a &s;ervant with us, to
&s;hew us through Lord Findlater's wood, by
which our way was &s;hortened, and we &s;aw &s;ome
part of his domain, which is indeed admirably
laid out. Dr. John&s;on did not chu&s;e to walk
through it. He always &s;aid, that he was not

come to Scotland to &s;ee fine places, of which
there were enough in England; but wild ob|jects,
&mdash;mountains,&mdash;water-falls,&mdash;peculiar
manners; in &s;hort, things which he had not &s;een
before. I have a notion that he at no time has
had much ta&s;te for rural beauties. I have my|&s;elf
very little.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, there was nothing more
contemptible than a country gentleman living
beyond his income, and every year growing
poorer and poorer. He &s;poke &s;trongly of the
influence which a man has by being rich. &startq;A
man (&s;aid he) who keeps his money, has in
reality more u&s;e from it, than he can have by
&s;pending it.&endq; I ob&s;erved that this looked very
like a paradox; but he explained it thus:
&startq;If it were certain that a man would keep
his money locked up for ever, to be &s;ure he
would have no influence; but, as &s;o many
want money, and he has the power of giving
it, and they know not but by gaining his fa|vour
they may obtain it, the rich man will al|ways
have the greate&s;t influence. He again
who lavi&s;hes his money, is laughed at as
fooli&s;h, and in a great degree with ju&s;tice,
con&s;idering how much is &s;pent from vanity.
Even tho&s;e who partake of a man's ho&s;pitality,
have but a tran&s;ient kindne&s;s for him. If he
has not the command of money, people know
he cannot help them, if he would; whereas
<PB N="120" REF="126">
the rich man always can, if he will, and for
the chance of that, will have much weight.&endq;&mdash;
<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;But philo&s;ophers and &s;atyri&s;ts have
all treated a mi&s;er as contemptible.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;He is &s;o philo&s;ophically; but not in the

England.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;There was Lowther.&endq;&mdash;

his money, had the command of the county,
which the family has now lo&s;t, by &s;pending it<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I do not know what was at this time the &s;tate of the par|liamentary intere&s;t of the ancient family of Lowther; a family before the Conque&s;t.

I take it, he lent a great deal; and that is the
way to have influence, and yet pre&s;erve one's
wealth. A man may lend his money upon
very good &s;ecurity, and yet have his debtor
much under his power.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;No doubt,
Sir. He can always di&s;tre&s;s him for the money;
as no man borrows, who is able to pay on de|mand
quite conveniently.&endq;</P>
<P>We dined at Elgin, and &s;aw the noble ruins
of the cathedral. Though it rained much, Dr.
John&s;on examined them with a mo&s;t patient
<PB N="121" REF="127">
attention. He could not here feel any abhor|rence
at the Scotti&s;h reformers, for he had
been told by Lord Hailes, that it was de&s;troyed
before the Reformation, by the Lord of Bade|noch
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>NOTE, by Lord <HI>Hailes.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;The cathedral of Elgin was burnt by the Lord of Bade|noch, becau&s;e the Bi&s;hop of Moray had pronounced an award not to his liking. The indemnification that the &s;ee obtained, was, that the Lord of Badenoch &s;tood for three days bare|footed at the great gate of the cathedral. The &s;tory is in the Chartulary of Elgin.&endq;</P></NOTE>, who had a quarrel with the bi&s;hop.
The bi&s;hop's hou&s;e, and tho&s;e of the other
clergy, which are &s;till pretty entire, do not
&s;eem to have been proportioned to the magni|ficence
of the cathedral, which has been of
great extent, and had very fine carved work.
The ground within the walls of the cathedral is
employed as a burying-place. The family of
Gordon have their vault here; but it has no|thing
grand.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed Gordon Ca&s;tle<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I am not &s;ure whether the duke was at home. But, not having the honour of being much known to his grace, I could not have pre&s;umed to enter his ca&s;tle, though to introduce even &s;o celebrated a &s;tranger. We were at any rate in a hurry to get forward to the wildne&s;s which we came to &s;ee.

which has a princely appearance. Fochabers, the
<PB N="122" REF="128">
neighbouring village, is a poor place, many of
the hou&s;es being ruinous; but it is remarkable,
they have in general orchards well &s;tored with
apple-trees. Elgin has what in England are
called piazzas, that run in many places on each
&s;ide of the &s;treet. It mu&s;t have been a much
better place formerly. Probably it had piazzas
all along the town, as I have &s;een at Bologna.
I approved much of &s;uch &s;tructures in a town,
on account of their conveniency in wet weather.
Dr. John&s;on di&s;approved of them, &startq;becau&s;e (&s;aid
he) it makes the under &s;tory of a hou&s;e very dark,
which greatly over-balances the conveniency,
when it is con&s;idered how &s;mall a part of the
year it rains; how few are u&s;ually in the &s;treet
at &s;uch times; that many who are might as
well be at home; and the little that people
&s;uffer, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be as much wet as
they commonly are in walking a &s;treet.&endq;</P>
<P>We fared but ill at our inn here; and Dr.
John&s;on &s;aid, this was the fir&s;t time he had
&s;een a dinner in Scotland that he could not eat.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, we drove over the very
heath where Macbeth met the witches, accord|ing
to tradition. Dr. John&s;on again &s;olemnly
repeated&mdash;
<Q><L>How far is't called to Fores? What are the&s;e,</L>
<L>So wither'd, and &s;o wild in their attire?</L>
<L>That look not like th' inhabitants o' th' earth,</L>
<L>And yet are on't?</L></Q>
<PB N="123" REF="129">
He repeated a good deal more of Macbeth.
His recitation was grand and affecting, and,
as Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds has ob&s;erved to me, had
no more tone than it &s;hould have. It was the
better for it. He then parodied the <HI>All-hail</HI>
of the witches to Macbeth, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf
to me. I had purcha&s;ed &s;ome land called
<HI>Dalblair;</HI> and, as in Scotland it is cu&s;tomary
to di&s;tingui&s;h landed men by the name of their
e&s;tates, I had thus two titles, <HI>Dalblair</HI> and Young
<HI>Auchinleck.</HI> So my friend, in imitation of
<Q><L>All hail Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!</L></Q>
conde&s;cended to amu&s;e him&s;elf with uttering
<Q><L>All hail Dalblair! hail to thee, Laird of Auchinleck!</L></Q></P>
<P>We got to Fores at night, and found an
admirable inn, in which Dr. John&s;on was
plea&s;ed to meet with a landlord who &s;tyled him|&s;elf
&startq;Wine-Cooper, from LONDON.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>27th Augu&s;t.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>It was dark when we came to Fores la&s;t
night; &s;o we did not &s;ee what is called King
Duncan's monument. I &s;hall now mark &s;ome
gleanings of Dr. John&s;on's conver&s;ation. I
&s;poke of <HI>Leonidas,</HI> and &s;aid there were &s;ome
good pa&s;&s;ages in it.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why, you
mu&s;t <HI>&s;eek</HI> for them.&endq;&mdash;He &s;aid, Paul White|head's
<PB N="124" REF="130">
<HI>Manners</HI> was a poor performance.&mdash;
Speaking of Derrick, he told me &startq;he had a
kindne&s;s for him, and had often &s;aid, that if
his letters had been written by one of a more
e&s;tabli&s;hed name, they would have been
thought very pretty letters.&endq;</P>
<P>This morning I introduced the &s;ubject of
the origin of evil.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Moral evil is
occa&s;ioned by free will,&endq; which implies choice
between good and evil. With all the evil
that there is, there is no man but would rather
be a free agent, than a mere machine without
the evil; and what is be&s;t for each individual,
mu&s;t be be&s;t for the whole. If a man would
rather be the machine, I cannot argue with
him. He is a different being from me.&mdash;
<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;A man, as a machine, may have
agreeable &s;en&s;ations; for in&s;tance, he may have
plea&s;ure in mu&s;ick.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, Sir, he
cannot have plea&s;ure in mu&s;ick, at lea&s;t no
power of producing mu&s;ick; for he who can
produce mu&s;ick may let it alone: he who can
play upon a fiddle may break it; &s;uch a man is
not a machine.&endq; This rea&s;oning &s;atisfied me.
It is certain, there cannot be a free agent, unle&s;s
there is the power of being evil as well as good.
We mu&s;t take the inherent po&s;&s;ibilities of
things into con&s;ideration, in our rea&s;onings or
conjectures concerning the works of GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="131">
We came to Nairn to breakfa&s;t. Though a
county town and a royal burgh, it is a mi&s;er|able
place. Over the room where we &s;at, a
girl was &s;pinning wool with a great wheel, and
&s;inging an Er&s;e &s;ong. &startq;I'll warrant you (&s;aid
Dr. John&s;on) one of the &s;ongs of O&s;&s;ian.&endq; He
then repeated the&s;e lines:</P>
<Q><L>Ver&s;e &s;weetens toil, however rude the &s;ound.</L>
<L>All at her work the village maiden &s;ings;</L>
<L>Nor while &s;he turns the giddy wheel around,</L>
<L>Revolves the &s;ad vici&s;&s;itude of things.</L></Q>
<P>I thought I had heard the&s;e lines before.&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;I fancy not, Sir; for they are in a
detached poem, the name of which I do not
remember, written by one Giffard, a par&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>I expected Mr. Kenneth M'Aulay, the mini|&s;ter
of Calder, who publi&s;hed the Hi&s;tory of
St. Kilda, a book which Dr. John&s;on liked,
would have met us here, as I had written to
him from Aberdeen. But I received a letter
from him, telling me that he could not leave
home, as he was to admini&s;ter the &s;acrament
the following Sunday, and earne&s;tly reque&s;ting
to &s;ee us at his man&s;e. &startq;We'll go,&endq; &s;aid
Dr. John&s;on; which we accordingly did. Mrs.
M'Aulay received us, and told us her hu&s;band
was in the church di&s;tributing tokens<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In Scotland, there is a great deal of preparation before ad|mini&s;trating the &s;acrament. The mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h exa|mines the people as to their fitne&s;s, and to tho&s;e of whom he approves gives little pieces of tin, &s;tamped with the name of the pari&s;h, as <HI>tokens,</HI> which they mu&s;t produce before receiving it. This is a &s;pecies of prie&s;tly power, and &s;ometimes may be abu&s;ed. I remember a law-&s;uit brought by a per&s;on again&s;t his pari&s;h mini&s;ter, for refu&s;ing him admi&s;&s;ion to that &s;acred ordinance.</NOTE>. We
<PB N="126" REF="132">
arrived between twelve and one o'clock, and
it was near three before he came to us.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on thanked him for his book, and
&s;aid &startq;it was a very pretty piece of topography.&endq;
M'Aulay did not &s;eem much to mind the
compliment. From his conver&s;ation, Dr.
John&s;on was per&s;uaded that he had not written
the book which goes under his name. I my&s;elf
always &s;u&s;pected &s;o; and I have been told it
was written by the learned Dr. John M'Pher|&s;on
of Sky, from the materials collected by
M'Aulay. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid privately to me,
&startq;There is a combination in it of which
M'Aulay is not capable.&endq; However, he was
exceedingly ho&s;pitable; and, as he obligingly
promi&s;ed us a route for our Tour through the
We&s;tern I&s;les, we agreed to &s;tay with him all
night.</P>
<P>After dinner, we walked to the old ca&s;tle of
Calder, (pronounced Cawder) the Thane of Caw|dor's
&s;eat. I was &s;orry that my friend, this
&startq;pro&s;perous gentleman,&endq; was not there. The
old tower mu&s;t be of great antiquity. There is a
draw-bridge,&mdash;what has been a moat,&mdash;and an
ancient court. There is a hawthorn-tree, which
<PB N="127" REF="133">
ri&s;es like a wooden pillar through the rooms of
the ca&s;tle, for, by a &s;trange conceit, the walls
have been built round it. The thickne&s;s of the
walls, the &s;mall &s;launting windows, and a great
iron door at the entrance on the &s;econd &s;tory
as you a&s;cend the &s;tairs, all indicate the rude
times in which this ca&s;tle was erected. There
were here &s;ome large venerable trees.</P>
<P>I was afraid of a quarrel between Dr. John&s;on
and Mr. M'Aulay, who talked &s;lightingly of
the lower Engli&s;h clergy. The Doctor gave
him a frowning look, and &s;aid, &startq;This is a day
of novelties: I have &s;een old trees in Scotland,
and I have heard the Engli&s;h clergy treated with
di&s;re&s;pect.&endq;</P>
<P>I dreaded that a whole evening at Calder|man&s;e
would be heavy; however, Mr. Grant,
an intelligent and well-bred mini&s;ter in the
neighbourhood, was there, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted us by
his conver&s;ation. Dr. John&s;on, talking of he|reditary
occupations in the Highlands, &s;aid,
&startq;There is no harm in &s;uch a cu&s;tom as this;
but it is wrong to enforce it, and oblige a
man to be a taylor or a &s;mith, becau&s;e his father
has been one.&endq; This cu&s;tom, however, is not
peculiar to our Highlands: it is well known
that in India a &s;imilar practice prevails.</P>
<P>Mr. M'Aulay began a rhap&s;ody again&s;t
creeds and confe&s;&s;ions. Dr. John&s;on &s;hewed
that &startq;what he called <HI>impo&s;ition,</HI> was only a volun|tary
<PB N="128" REF="134">
declaration of agreement in certain articles
of faith, which a church has a right to require,
ju&s;t as any other &s;ociety can in&s;i&s;t on certain
rules being ob&s;erved by it's members. No|body
is compelled to be of the church, as no|body
is compelled to enter into a &s;ociety.&endq;&mdash;
This was a very clear and ju&s;t view of the
&s;ubject. But, M'Aulay could not be driven
out of his track. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;Sir, you
are a <HI>bigot to laxne&s;s.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. M'Aulay and I laid the map of Scotland
before us; and he pointed out a route for us
from Inverne&s;s, by Fort Augu&s;tus, to Glenelg,
Sky, Mull, Icolmkill, Lorn, and Inveraray,
which I wrote down. As my father was to
begin the northern circuit about the 18th of
September, it was nece&s;&s;ary for us either to
make our tour with great expedition, &s;o as to
get to Auchinleck before he &s;et out, or to pro|tract
it, &s;o as not to be there till his return, which
would be about the 10th of October. By
M'Aulay's calculation, we were not to land in
Lorn till the 20th of September. I thought
that the interruptions by bad days, or by occa|&s;ional
excur&s;ions, might make it ten days later;
and I thought too, that we might perhaps go
to Benbecula, and vi&s;it Clanranald, which
would take a week of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on went up with Mr. Grant to the
library, which con&s;i&s;ted of a tolerable collection;
<PB N="129" REF="135">
but the Doctor thought it rather a lady's li|brary,
with &s;ome Latin books in it by chance,
than the library of a clergyman. It had only
two of the Latin fathers, and one of the Greek
ones in Latin. I doubted whether Dr. John&s;on
would be pre&s;ent at a Pre&s;byterian prayer. I
told M'Aulay &s;o, and &s;aid that the Doctor
might &s;it in the library while we were at family
wor&s;hip. M'Aulay &s;aid, he would omit it,
rather than give Dr. John&s;on offence: But I
would by no means agree that an exce&s;s of po|litene&s;s,
even to &s;o great a man, &s;hould prevent
what I e&s;teem as one of the be&s;t pious regulations.
I know nothing more beneficial, more comfort|able,
more agreeable, than that the little &s;ocie|ties
of each family &s;hould regularly a&s;&s;emble,
and unite in prai&s;e and prayer to our heavenly
Father, from whom we daily receive &s;o much
good, and may hope for more in a higher &s;tate
of exi&s;tence. I mentioned to Dr. John&s;on the
over-delicate &s;crupulo&s;ity of our ho&s;t. He &s;aid
he had no objection to hear the prayer. This
was a plea&s;ing &s;urpri&s;e to me; for he refu&s;ed to
go and hear Principal Robert&s;on preach. &startq;I
will hear him, (&s;aid he) if he will get up into a
tree and preach; but I will not give a &s;anction,
by my pre&s;ence, to a Pre&s;byterian a&s;&s;embly.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Grant having prayed, Dr. John&s;on
&s;aid, his prayer was a very good one; but
objected to his not having introduced the
<PB N="130" REF="136">
Lord's Prayer. He told us, that an Italian of
&s;ome note in London &s;aid once to him, &startq;We
have in our &s;ervice a prayer called the <HI>Pater
No&s;ter,</HI> which is a very fine compo&s;ition. I
wonder who is the author of it.&endq;&mdash;A &s;ingular

in his pocket from Edinburgh. He gave it
la&s;t night to Mr. M'Aulay's &s;on, a &s;mart young
lad about eleven years old. Dr. John&s;on had
given an account of the education at Oxford, in
all its gradations. The advantage of being a
&s;ervitor to a youth of little fortune &s;truck Mrs.
M'Aulay much. I ob&s;erved it aloud. Dr.
John&s;on very hand&s;omely and kindly &s;aid, that,
if they would &s;end their boy to him, when he
was ready for the univer&s;ity, he would get him
made a &s;ervitor, and perhaps would do more
for him. He could not promi&s;e to do
more; but would undertake for the &s;ervitor|&s;hip
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on did not neglect what he had undertaken. By his intere&s;t with the Rev. Dr. Adams, ma&s;ter of Pembroke College, Oxford, where he was educated for &s;ome time, he obtained a &s;ervitor&s;hip for young M'Aulay. But it &s;eems he had other views; and I believe went abroad.</NOTE>.</P>

I &s;hould have mentioned that Mr. White, a

M'Aulay, and a&s;ked us to his hou&s;e. We had
not time to accept of his invitation. He gave
us a letter of introduction to Mr. Ferne, ma&s;ter

It recommended &startq;two celebrated gentlemen;
no le&s;s than Dr. John&s;on, <HI>author of his Dictionary,</HI>

he would alter it. I thought it was a pity to
check his effu&s;ions, and acquie&s;ced; taking

not appear that I had read it.</P>
<P>A conver&s;ation took place, about &s;aying
grace at breakfa&s;t (as we do in Scotland) as well
as at dinner and &s;upper; in which Dr. John&s;on
&s;aid, &startq;It is enough if we have &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons of
prayer; no matter when. A man may as well
pray when he mounts his hor&s;e, or a woman

us is done in the Highlands) as at meals; and
cu&s;tom is to be followed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He could not bear to have it thought that, in any in&s;tance whatever, the Scots are more pious than the Engli&s;h.

<HI>Brew&s;e</HI> of the Engineers, pronounced <HI>Bruce.</HI>
He &s;aid he believed it was originally the &s;ame
Norman name with Bruce. That he had dined
at a hou&s;e in London, where were three Bruces,
one of the Iri&s;h line, one of the Scotti&s;h line,
and him&s;elf of the Engli&s;h line. He &s;aid he
was &s;hewn it in the Herald's office &s;pelt four|teen
different ways. I told him the different
&s;pellings of my name. Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved,
that there had been great di&s;putes about the
&s;pelling of Shak&s;peare's name; at la&s;t it was
thought it would be &s;ettled by looking at the
original copy of his will; but, upon examining
it, he was found to have written it him&s;elf no
le&s;s than three different ways.</P>
<P>Mr. Ferne and Major Brew&s;e fir&s;t carried us
to wait on Sir Eyre Coote, who&s;e regiment,
the 37th, was lying here, and who then com|manded
the fort. He a&s;ked us to dine with
him, which we agreed to do.</P>
<P>Before dinner we examined the fort. The
Major explained the fortification to us, and
Mr. Ferne gave us an account of the &s;tores.
Dr. John&s;on talked of the proportions of char|coal
and &s;alt-petre in making gunpowder, of
granulating it, and of giving it a glo&s;s. He
<PB N="133" REF="139">
made a very good figure upon the&s;e topicks.
He &s;aid to me afterward, that &startq;he had talked
<HI>o&s;tentatiou&s;ly.</HI>&endq;&mdash;We repo&s;ed our&s;elves a little in
Mr. Ferne's hou&s;e. He had every thing in
neat order as in England; and a tolerable
collection of books. I looked into Pennant's
Tour in Scotland. He &s;ays little of this fort;
but that &startq;the barracks, &amp;c. form &s;everal
&s;treets.&endq; This is aggrandi&s;ing. Mr. Ferne ob|&s;erved,
if he had &s;aid they form a &s;quare, with
a row of buildings before it, he would have
given a ju&s;ter de&s;cription. Dr. John&s;on re|marked,
&startq;how &s;eldom de&s;criptions corre&s;pond
with realities; and the rea&s;on is, that people
do not write them till &s;ome time after, and
then their imagination has added circum|&s;tances.&endq;</P>
<P>We talked of Sir Adolphus Oughton. The
Major &s;aid, he knew a great deal for a military
man.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, you will find few men,
of any profe&s;&s;ion, who know more. Sir Adol|phus
is a very extraordinary man; a man of
boundle&s;s curio&s;ity and unwearied diligence.&endq;</P>
<P>I know not how the Major contrived to in|troduce
the conte&s;t between Warburton and
Lowth.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Warburton kept his temper
all along, while Lowth was in a pa&s;&s;ion. Lowth
publi&s;hed &s;ome of Warburton's letters. War|burton
drew <HI>him</HI> on to write &s;ome very abu&s;ive
letters, and then a&s;ked his leave to publi&s;h
<PB N="134" REF="140">
them; which he knew Lowth could not refu&s;e,
after what <HI>he</HI> had done. So that Warburton
contrived that he &s;hould publi&s;h, apparently
with Lowth's con&s;ent, what could not but &s;hew
Lowth in a di&s;advantageous light<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Here Dr. John&s;on gave us part of a conver&s;ation held be|tween a Great Per&s;onage and him, in the library at the Queen's Palace, in the cour&s;e of which this conte&s;t was con&s;i|dered. I have been at great pains to get that conver&s;ation as perfectly pre&s;erved as po&s;&s;ible. It will appear in Dr. John&s;on's LIFE.</NOTE>&endq;.</P>
<P>At three the drum beat for dinner. I, for a
little while, fancied my&s;elf a military man, and
it plea&s;ed me. We went to Sir Eyre Coote's,
at the governor's hou&s;e, and found him a mo&s;t
gentleman-like man. His lady is a very
agreeable woman, with an uncommonly mild
and &s;weet tone of voice. There was a pretty
large company: Mr. Ferne, Major Brew&s;e, and
&s;everal officers. Sir Eyre had come from the
Ea&s;t-Indies by land, through the De&s;arts of
Arabia. He told us, the Arabs could live five
days without victuals, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t for three
weeks on nothing el&s;e but the blood of their
camels, who could lo&s;e &s;o much of it as would
&s;uffice for that time, without being exhau&s;ted.
He highly prai&s;ed the virtue of the Arabs;
their fidelity, if they undertook to conduct any
per&s;on; and &s;aid, they would &s;acrifice their lives
rather than let him be robbed. Dr. John&s;on,
who is always for maintaining the &s;uperiority
of civilized over uncivilized men, &s;aid, &startq;Why,
<PB N="135" REF="141">
Sir, I can &s;ee no &s;uperior virtue in this. A
&s;erjeant and twelve men, who are my guard,
will die, rather than that I &s;hall be robbed.&endq;&mdash;
Colonel Pennington, of the 37th regiment,
took up the argument with a good deal of &s;pirit
and ingenuity.&mdash;<HI>Pennington.</HI> &startq;But the &s;oldiers
are compelled to this, by fear of puni&s;hment.&endq;
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Well, Sir, the Arabs are compelled
by the fear of infamy.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Pennington.</HI> &startq;The
&s;oldiers have the &s;ame fear of infamy, and the
fear of puni&s;hment be&s;ides; &s;o have le&s;s virtue,
becau&s;e they act le&s;s voluntarily.&endq;&mdash;Lady
Coote ob&s;erved very well, that it ought to be
known if there was not, among the Arabs,
&s;ome puni&s;hment for not being faithful on &s;uch
occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>We talked of the &s;tage. I ob&s;erved, that we
had not now &s;uch a company of actors as in the
la&s;t age; Wilks, Booth, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;You
think &s;o, becau&s;e there is one who excels all
the re&s;t &s;o much: you compare them with
Garrick, and &s;ee the deficiency. Garrick's
great di&s;tinction is his univer&s;ality. He can
repre&s;ent all modes of life, but that of an ea&s;y
fine-bred gentleman.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Pennington.</HI> &startq;He &s;hould
give over playing young parts.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;He
does not take them now; but he does not leave
off tho&s;e which he has been u&s;ed to play, be|cau&s;e
he does them better than any one el&s;e
can do them. If you had generations of actors,
<PB N="136" REF="142">
if they &s;warmed like bees, the young ones
might drive off the old. Mrs, Cibber, I think,
got more reputation than &s;he de&s;erved, as &s;he
had a great &s;amene&s;s; though her expre&s;&s;ion
was undoubtedly very fine. Mrs. Clive was
the be&s;t player I ever &s;aw. Mrs. Pritchard was a
very good one; but &s;he had &s;omething affected
in her manner: I imagine &s;he had &s;ome
player of the former age in her eye, which oc|ca&s;ioned
it.&endq;</P>
<P>Colonel Pennington &s;aid, Garrick &s;ometimes
failed in empha&s;is; as for in&s;tance, in <HI>Hamlet,</HI>
<Q><L>I will &s;peak <HI>daggers</HI> to her; but u&s;e <HI>none.</HI></L></Q>
in&s;tead of</P>
<Q><L>I will <HI>&s;peak</HI> daggers to her; but <HI>u&s;e</HI> none.</L></Q>
<P>We had a dinner of two compleat cour&s;es,
variety of wines, and the regimental band of
mu&s;ick playing in the &s;quare, before the win|dows,
after it. I enjoyed this day much. We
were quite ea&s;y and cheerful. Dr. John&s;on
&s;aid, &startq;I &s;hall always remember this fort with
gratitude.&endq; I could not help being &s;truck
with &s;ome admiration, at finding upon this
barren &s;andy point, &s;uch buildings,&mdash;&s;uch a
dinner,&mdash;&s;uch company. It was like enchant|ment.
Dr. John&s;on, on the other hand, &s;aid to
me more rationally, that &startq;it did not &s;trike
<HI>him</HI> as any thing extraordinary; becau&s;e he
<PB N="137" REF="143">
knew, here was a large &s;um of money expended
in building a fort; here was a regiment. If
there had been le&s;s than what we found, it
would have &s;urprized him.&endq; <HI>He</HI> looked coolly
and deliberately through all the gradations.
My warm imagination jumped from the barren
&s;ands to the &s;plendid dinner and brilliant com|pany.
Like the hero in <HI>Love in a Hollow Tree,</HI></P>
<Q><L>&startq;Without ands of ifs,</L>
<L>I leapt from off the &s;ands upon the cliffs.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>The whole &s;cene gave me a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of
the power and excellence of human art.</P>
<P>We left the fort between &s;ix and &s;even
o'clock. Sir Eyre Coote, Colonel Pennington,
and &s;everal more, accompanied us down &s;tairs,
and &s;aw us into our chai&s;e. There could not
be greater attention paid to any vi&s;itors. Sir
Eyre &s;poke of the hard&s;hips which Dr. John&s;on
had before him.&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;Con&s;idering what
he has &s;aid of us, we mu&s;t make him feel &s;ome|thing
rough in Scotland.&endq;&mdash;Sir Eyre &s;aid to
him, &startq;You mu&s;t change your name, Sir.&endq;&mdash;
<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;Aye, to Dr. M'Gregor.&endq;</P>
<P>We got &s;afely to Inverne&s;s, and put up at
Mackenzie's inn. Mr. Keith, the collector of
Exci&s;e here, my old acquaintance at Ayr, who
had &s;een us at the Fort, vi&s;ited us in the evening,
and engaged us to dine with him next day,
promi&s;ing to breakfa&s;t with us, and take us
<PB N="138" REF="144">
to the Engli&s;h chapel; &s;o that we were at once
commodiou&s;ly arranged.</P>
<P>Not finding a letter here that I expected, I
felt a momentary impatience to be at home.
Tran&s;ient clouds darkened my imagination,
and in tho&s;e clouds I &s;aw events from which I
&s;hrunk; but a &s;entence or two of the <HI>Rambler's</HI>
conver&s;ation gave me firmne&s;s, and I con|&s;idered
that I was upon an expedition for
which I had wi&s;hed for years, and the recollec|tion
of which would be a trea&s;ure to me for
life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>29th Augu&s;t.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. Keith breakfa&s;ted with us. Dr. John&s;on
expatiated rather too &s;trongly upon the benefits
derived to Scotland from the Union, and the
bad &s;tate of our people before it. I am enter|tained
with his copious exaggeration upon that
&s;ubject; but I am unea&s;y when people are by,
who do not know him as well as I do, and may
be apt to think him narrow-minded<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable that Dr. John&s;on read this gentle re|mon&s;trance, and took no notice of it to me.</NOTE>. I there|fore
diverted the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h chapel, to which we went this
morning, was but mean. The altar was a
bare fir table, with a coar&s;e &s;tool for kneeling
on, covered with a piece of thick &s;ail-cloth
doubled, by way of cu&s;hion. The congrega|tion
<PB N="139" REF="145">
was &s;mall. Mr. Tait, the clergyman,
read prayers very well, though with much of
the Scotch accent. He preached on &startq;<HI>Love
your Enemies.</HI>&endq; It was remarkable that, when
talking of the connections among&s;t men, he
&s;aid, that &s;ome connected them&s;elves with men
of di&s;tingui&s;hed talents, and &s;ince they could
not equal them, tried to deck them&s;elves with
their merit, by being their companions. The
&s;entence was to this purpo&s;e. It had an odd
coincidence with what might be &s;aid of my
connecting my&s;elf with Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P>After church, we walked down to the Quay.
We then went to Macbeth's ca&s;tle. I had a
romantick &s;atisfaction in &s;eeing Dr. John&s;on
actually in it. It perfectly corre&s;ponds with
Shak&s;peare's de&s;cription, which Sir Jo&s;hua
Reynolds has &s;o happily illu&s;trated, in one of
his notes on our immortal poet:</P>
<Q><L>&startq;This ca&s;tle hath a plea&s;ant &s;eat: the air</L>
<L>Nimbly and &s;weetly recommends it&s;elf</L>
<L>Unto our gentle &s;en&s;e,&endq; &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>Ju&s;t as we came out of it, a raven perched on
one of the chimney tops, and croaked. Then
I repeated</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;&startq;The raven him&s;elf is hoar&s;e,</L>
<L>That croaks the fatal enterance of Duncan</L>
<L>Under my battlements.&endq;</L></Q>
<P><PB N="140" REF="146">
We dined at Mr. Keith's. Mrs. Keith was
rather too attentive to Dr. John&s;on, a&s;king him
many que&s;tions about his drinking only water.
He repre&s;&s;ed that ob&s;ervation, by &s;aying to
me, &startq;You may remember that Lady Errol
took no notice of this.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on has the happy art (for which I
have heard my father prai&s;e the old Earl of
Aberdeen) of in&s;tructing him&s;elf, by making
every man he meets tell him &s;omething of
what he knows be&s;t. He led Keith to talk to
him of the Exci&s;e in Scotland, and, in the
cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, mentioned that his
friend Mr. Thrale, the great brewer, paid
twenty thou&s;and pounds a year to the revenue;
and that he had four ca&s;ks, each of which holds
&s;ixteen hundred barrels,&mdash;above a thou&s;and
hog&s;heads.</P>
<P>After this there was little conver&s;ation that
de&s;erves to be remembered. I &s;hall therefore
here again glean what I have omitted on
former days. Dr. Gerrard, at Aberdeen, told
us, that when he was in Wales, he was &s;hewn
a valley inhabited by Danes, who &s;till retain
their own language, and are quite a di&s;tinct
people. Dr. John&s;on thought it could not be
true, or all the kingdom mu&s;t have heard of it.
He &s;aid to me, as we travelled, &startq;the&s;e people,
Sir, that Gerrard talks of, may have &s;omewhat
of a <HI>peregrinity</HI> in their dialect, which relation
<PB N="141" REF="147">
has augmented to a different language.&endq; I
a&s;ked him if <HI>peregrinity</HI> was an Engli&s;h word?
He laughed, and &s;aid, &startq;No.&endq; I told him
this was the &s;econd time that I had heard him
coin a word. When Foote broke his leg, I
ob&s;erved that it would make him fitter for
taking off George Faulkner as Peter Paragraph,
poor George having a wooden leg. Dr. John|&s;on
at that time &s;aid, &startq;George will rejoice at
the <HI>depeditation</HI> of Foote;&endq; and when I chal|lenged
that word, laughed, and owned he had
made it; and added that he had not made
above three or four in his Dictionary<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">When upon the &s;ubject of this <HI>peregrinity,</HI> he told me &s;ome particulars concerning the compilation of his Dictionary, and concerning his throwing off Lord Che&s;terfield's patronage, of which very erroneous accounts have been circulated. The&s;e particulars, with others which he afterwards gave me,&mdash;as al&s;o his celebrated letter to Lord Che&s;terfield, which he dictated to $word$,&mdash;I re&s;erve for his &startq;LIFE.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having conducted Dr. John&s;on to our inn,
I begged permi&s;&s;ion to leave him for a little,
that I might run about and pay &s;ome &s;hort vi|&s;its
to &s;everal good people of Inverne&s;s. He
&s;aid to me, &startq;You have all the old-fa&s;hioned
principles, good and bad.&endq;&mdash;I acknowledge I
have. That of attention to relations in the
remote&s;t degree, or to worthy per&s;ons in every
&s;tate whom I have once known, I inherit from
my father. It gave me much &s;atisfaction to
hear every body at Inverne&s;s &s;peak of him with
<PB N="142" REF="148">
uncommon regard.&mdash;Mr. Keith and Mr. Grant,
whom we had &s;een at Mr. M'Aulay's, &s;upped
with us at the inn. We had roa&s;ted kid, which
Dr. John&s;on had never ta&s;ted before. He re|li&s;hed
it much.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>30th Augu&s;t.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>This day we were to begin our <HI>equitation,</HI> as
I &s;aid; for <HI>I</HI> would needs make a word too.
It is remarkable, that my noble, and to me mo&s;t
con&s;tant friend, the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> (who,
if there is too much ea&s;e on my part, will be
plea&s;ed to pardon what his benevolent, gay,
&s;ocial intercour&s;e, and lively corre&s;pondence,
have in&s;en&s;ibly produced) has &s;ince hit upon
the very &s;ame word. The title of the fir&s;t
edition of his lord&s;hip's very u&s;eful book was,
in &s;imple terms, &startq;A Method of breaking
Hor&s;es, and teaching Soldiers to ride.&endq; The
title of the &s;econd edition is, &startq;MILITARY
EQUITATION.&endq;</P>
<P>We might have taken a chai&s;e to Fort Au|gu&s;tus;
but, had we not hired hor&s;es at Inver|ne&s;s,
we &s;hould not have found them afterwards.
So we re&s;olved to begin here to ride. We
had three hor&s;es, for Dr. John&s;on, my&s;elf, and
Jo&s;eph, and one which carried our portman|teaus,
and two Highlanders who walked along
with us, John Gray and Lauchlan Va&s;s, whom
Dr. John&s;on has remembered with credit in his
<PB N="143" REF="149">
JOURNEY, though he has omitted their names.
Dr. John&s;on rode very well.</P>
<P>About three miles beyond Inverne&s;s, we &s;aw,
ju&s;t by the road, a very compleat &s;pecimen of
what is called a Druid's temple. There was a
double circle, one of very large, the other of
&s;maller &s;tones. Dr. John&s;on ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that,
&startq;to go and &s;ee one druidical temple is only to &s;ee
that it is nothing, for there is neither art nor
power in it; and &s;eeing one is quite enough.&endq;</P>
<P>It was a delightful day. Lochne&s;s, and the
road upon the &s;ide of it, &s;haded with birch
trees, and the hills above it, plea&s;ed us much.
The &s;cene was as &s;eque&s;tered and agreeably
wild as could be de&s;ired, and for a time en|gro&s;&s;ed
all our attention.</P>
<P>To &s;ee Dr. John&s;on in any new &s;ituation is
always an intere&s;ting object to me; and, as I
&s;aw him now for the fir&s;t time on hor&s;e-back,
jaunting about at his ea&s;e in que&s;t of plea&s;ure
and novelty, the very different occupations of
his former laborious life, his admirable produc|tions,
his <HI>London,</HI> his <HI>Rambler,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. im|mediately
pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my mind,
and the contra&s;t made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on
my imagination.</P>
<P>When we had advanced a good way by the
&s;ide of Lochne&s;s, I perceived a little hut, with
an old-looking woman at the door of it. I
thought here might be a &s;cene that would
<PB N="144" REF="150">
amu&s;e Dr. John&s;on; &s;o I mentioned it to him.
&startq;Let's go in,&endq; &s;aid he. So we di&s;mounted,
and we and our guides entered the hut. It
was a wretched little hovel of earth only, I
think, and for a window had only a &s;mall hole,
which was &s;topped with a piece of turf, that was
taken out occa&s;ionally to let in light. In the
middle of the room or &s;pace which we entered,
was a fire of peat, the &s;moke going out at a
hole in the roof. She had a pot upon it, with
goat's fle&s;h, boiling. There was at one end
under the &s;ame roof, but divided by a kind
of partition made of wattles, a pen or fold in
which we &s;aw a good many kids.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on was curious to know where &s;he
&s;lept. I a&s;ked one of the guides, who que&s;|tioned
her in Er&s;e. She an&s;wered with a tone
of emotion, &s;aying, (as he told us) &s;he was
afraid we wanted to go to bed to her. This
<HI>coquetry,</HI> or whatever it may be called, of &s;o
wretched a being, was truly ludicrous. Dr.
John&s;on and I afterwards were merry upon it.
I &s;aid, it was he who alarmed the poor woman's
virtue.&mdash;&startq;No, Sir, (&s;aid he) &s;he'll &s;ay, &startq;there
came a wicked young fellow, a wild dog,&endq; who
I believe would have ravi&s;hed me, had there
not been with him a grave old gentleman, who
repre&s;&s;ed him: but when he gets out of the
&s;ight of his tutor, I'll warrant you he'll &s;pare
no woman he meets, young or old.&endq;&mdash;&startq;No,&endq;
<PB N="145" REF="151">
Sir, (I replied) &s;he'll &s;ay, &startq;There was a terrible
ruffian who would have forced me, had it not
been for a civil decent young man, who,
I take it, was an angel &s;ent from heaven to
protect me.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on would not hurt her delicacy, by
in&s;i&s;ting on &startq;&s;eeing her bed chamber,&endq; like
<HI>Archer</HI> in the <HI>Beaux Stratagem.</HI> But my curi|o&s;ity
was more ardent; I lighted a piece of
paper, and went into the place where the bed
was. There was a little partition of wicker,
rather more neatly done than the one for the
fold, and clo&s;e by the wall was a kind of bed|&s;tead
of wood with heath upon it by way of
bed; at the foot of which I &s;aw &s;ome &s;ort of
blankets or covering rolled up in a heap. The
woman's name was Fra&s;er; &s;o was her hu&s;|band's.
He was a man of eighty. Mr. Fra&s;er
of Balnain allows him to live in this hut, and
keep &s;ixty goats, for taking care of his woods,
where he then was. They had five children, the
elde&s;t only thirteen. Two were gone to In|verne&s;s
to buy meal; the re&s;t were looking
after the goats. This contented family had
four &s;tacks of barley, twenty-four &s;heaves in
each. They had a few fowls. We were informed
that they lived all the &s;pring without meal,
upon milk and curds and whey alone. What
they get for their goats, kids, and fowls, main|tains
them during the re&s;t of the year.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="152">
She a&s;ked us to &s;it down and take a dram.
I &s;aw one chair. She &s;aid, &s;he was as happy
as any woman in Scotland. She could hardly
&s;peak any Engli&s;h, except a few detached
words. Dr. John&s;on was plea&s;ed at &s;eeing,
for the fir&s;t time, &s;uch a &s;tate of human life.
She a&s;ked for &s;nuff. It is her luxury, and &s;he
u&s;es a great deal. We had none; but gave her
&s;ixpence a piece. She then brought out her
whi&s;ky bottle. I ta&s;ted it; as did Jo&s;eph
and our guides. So I gave her &s;ixpence
more. She &s;ent us away with many prayers in
Er&s;e.</P>
<P>We dined at a little publick hou&s;e called
the <HI>General's</HI> Hut, from General Wade, who
was lodged there when he commanded in the
North. Near it is the meane&s;t pari&s;h <HI>Kirk</HI> I
ever &s;aw. It is a &s;hame it &s;hould be on a high
road. After dinner, we pa&s;&s;ed through a
good deal of mountainous country. I had
known Mr. Trapaud, the deputy governour of
Fort Augu&s;tus, twelve years ago, at a circuit
at Inverne&s;s, where my father was judge. I
&s;ent forward one of our guides, and Jo&s;eph,
with a card to him, that he might know Dr.
John&s;on and I were coming up, leaving it to
him to invite us or not. It was dark when we
arrived. The inn was wretched. Government
ought to build one, or give the re&s;ident gover|nour
an additional &s;alary; as, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate
<PB N="147" REF="153">
of things, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be put to a great
expence in entertaining travellers. Jo&s;eph
announced to us, when we alighted, that the
governour waited for us at the gate of the fort.
We walked to it. He met us, and with much
civility conducted us to his hou&s;e. It was
comfortable to find our&s;elves in a well-built
little &s;quare, and a neatly furni&s;hed hou&s;e, in
good company, and with a good &s;upper before
us; in &s;hort, with all the conveniencies of civi|lized
life in the mid&s;t of rude mountains. Mrs.
Trapaud, and the governour's daughter, and her
hu&s;band, Captain Newmar&s;h, were all mo&s;t ob|liging
and polite. The governour had excellent
animal &s;pirits, the conver&s;ation of a &s;oldier,
and &s;omewhat of a Frenchman, to which his
extraction entitles him. He is brother to Ge|neral
Cyrus Trapaud. We pa&s;&s;ed a very agree|able
evening.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tue&s;day, <DATE>31&s;t Augu&s;t.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The governour has a very good garden. We
looked at it, and at all the re&s;t of the fort, which
is but &s;mall, and may be commanded from a
variety of hills around. We al&s;o looked at the
galley or &s;loop belonging to the fort, which
fails upon the Loch, and brings what is wanted
for the garri&s;on, Captains Urie and Darippe,
of the 15th regiment of foot, breakfa&s;ted with
us. They had &s;erved in America, and enter|tained
<PB N="148" REF="154">
Dr. John&s;on much with an account of
the Indians. He &s;aid, he could make a very
pretty book out of them, were he to &s;tay there.
Governor Trapaud was much &s;truck with Dr.
John&s;on. &startq;I like to hear him, (&s;aid he) it is
&s;o maje&s;tick. I &s;hould be glad to hear him
&s;peak in your court.&endq;&mdash;He pre&s;&s;ed us to &s;tay
dinner; but I con&s;idered that we had a rude
road before us, which we could more ea&s;ily en|counter
in the morning, and that it was hard to
&s;ay when we might get up, were we to &s;it down
to good entertainment, in good company: I
therefore begged the governour would excu&s;e
us. Here, too, I had another very plea&s;ing
proof how much my father is regarded. The
governour expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t re&s;pect for him,
and bade me tell him, that, if he would come that
way on a circuit to Inverne&s;s, he would do him
all the honours of the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>Between twelve and one we &s;et out, and
travelled eleven miles, through a wild country,
till we came to a hou&s;e in <HI>Glenmori&s;on,</HI> called
<HI>Anoch,</HI> kept by a M'Queen<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>A</HI> M'Queen is a Highland mode of expre&s;&s;ion. An Eng|li&s;hman would &s;ay <HI>one</HI> M'Queen.

was a &s;en&s;ible fellow: he had learnt his gram|mar,
<PB N="149" REF="155">
and Dr. John&s;on ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that
&startq;a man is the better for that as long as he
lives.&endq; There were &s;ome books here: a Trea|ti&s;e
again&s;t Drunkenne&s;s, tran&s;lated from the
French; a volume of the Spectator; a volume
of Prideaux's Connection, and Cyrus's Travels.
M'Queen &s;aid he had more volumes; and his
pride &s;eemed to be much piqued that we were
&s;urpri&s;ed at his having books.</P>
<P>Near to this place we had pa&s;&s;ed a party of
&s;oldiers, under a &s;erjeant's command, at work
upon the road. We gave them two &s;hillings to
drink. They came to our inn, and made merry
in the barn. We went and paid them a vi&s;it,
Dr. John&s;on &s;aying, &startq;Come, let's go and give
'em another &s;hilling a-piece.&endq; We did &s;o;
and he was &s;aluted &startq;MY LORD&endq; by all of
them. He is really generous, loves influence,
and has the way of gaining it. He &s;aid, &startq;I
am quite feudal, Sir.&endq; Here I agree with him.
I &s;aid, I regretted I was not the head of a clan;
however, though not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch an here|ditary
advantage, I would always endeavour to
make my tenants follow me. I could not be a
<HI>patriarchal</HI> chief, but I would be a <HI>feudal</HI> chief.</P>
<P>The poor &s;oldiers got too much liquor. Some
of them fought, and left blood upon the &s;pot,
and cur&s;ed whi&s;ky next morning. The hou&s;e
here was built of thick turfs, and thatched with
thinner turfs and heath. It had three rooms in
<PB N="150" REF="156">
length, and a little room which projected.
Where we &s;at, the &s;ide-walls were <HI>wain&s;cotted,</HI>
as Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, with wicker, very neatly
plaited. Our landlord had made the whole
with his own hands.</P>
<P>After dinner, M'Queen &s;at by us awhile,
and talked with us. He &s;aid, all the Laird of
Glenmori&s;on's people would bleed for him, if
they were well u&s;ed; but that &s;eventy men had
gone out of the Glen to America. That he
him&s;elf intended to go next year; for that the
rent of his farm, which twenty years ago was
only five pounds, was now rai&s;ed to twenty
pounds. That he could pay ten pounds, and
live; but no more.&mdash;Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, he
wi&s;hed M'Queen laird of Glenmori&s;on, and the
laird to go to America. M'Queen very gene|rou&s;ly
an&s;wered, he &s;hould be &s;orry for it; for
the laird could not &s;hift for him&s;elf in America
as he could do.</P>
<P>I talked of the officers whom we had left to|day;
how much &s;ervice they had &s;een, and
how little they got for it, even of fame.&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, a &s;oldier gets as little as any
man can get.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;Gold&s;mith has ac|quired
more &s;ame than all the officers la&s;t war,
who were not Generals.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why, Sir,
you will find ten thou&s;and fit to do what they did,
before you find one who does what Gold&s;mith
has done. You mu&s;t con&s;ider, that a thing is
<PB N="151" REF="157">
valued according to its rarity. A pebble that
paves the &s;treet is in it&s;elf more u&s;eful than the
diamond upon a lady's finger.&endq;&mdash;I wi&s;h our
friend Gold&s;mith had heard this.</P>
<P>I ye&s;terday expre&s;&s;ed my wonder that John
Hay, one of our guides, who had been pre&s;&s;ed
aboard a man of war, did not chu&s;e to continue
longer than nine months, after which time he
got off.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why, Sir, no man will be
a &s;ailor, who has contrivance enough to get him|&s;elf
into a jail; for, being in a &s;hip is being in
a jail, with the chance of being drowned.&endq;</P>
<P>We had tea in the afternoon, and our land|lord's
daughter, a mode&s;t civil girl, very neatly
dre&s;t, made it for us. She told us, &s;he had been
a year at Inverne&s;s, and learnt reading and
writing, &s;ewing, knotting, working lace, and
pa&s;try. Dr. John&s;on made her a pre&s;ent of a
book which he had bought at Inverne&s;s<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This book has given ri&s;e to much inquiry, which has ended in ludicrous &s;urpri&s;e. Several ladies, wi&s;hing to learn the kind of reading which the great and good Dr. John&s;on e&s;teemed mo&s;t fit for a young woman, de&s;ired to know what book he had &s;elected for this Highland nymph. &startq;They never adverted (&s;aid he) that I had no <HI>choice</HI> in the matte$. I have &s;aid that I pre&s;ented her with a book which I <HI>happened</HI> to have about me.&endq;&mdash;And what was this book?&mdash;My readers, prepare your features for merriment. It was <HI>Cocker's Arith|metick!</HI>&mdash;Wherever this was mentioned, there was a loud laugh, at which Dr. John&s;on, when pre&s;ent, u&s;ed &s;ometimes to be a little angry. One day, when we were dining at Ge|neral Oglethorpe's, where we had many a valuable day, I ventured to interrogate him, &startq;But, Sir, is it not &s;omewhat &s;ingular that you &s;hould <HI>ba$pen</HI> to have <HI>Cocker's Arithmetick</HI> about you on your journey? What made you buy &s;uch a book at Inverne&s;s?&endq;&mdash;He gave me a very &s;ufficient an&s;wer. &startq;Why, Sir, if you are to have but one book with you upon a journey, let it be a book of &s;cience. When you have read through a book of entertainment, you know it, and it can do no more for you; but a book of &s;cience is inexhau&s;tible.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>

The room had &s;ome deals laid acro&s;s the
joi&s;ts, as a kind of cieling. There were two
beds in the room, and a woman's grown was
hung on a rope to make a curtain of &s;eparation
between them. Jo&s;eph had &s;heets, which my
wife had &s;ent with us, laid on them. We had
much he&s;itation, whether to undre&s;s, or lye
down with our clothes on. I &s;aid at la&s;t, &startq;I'll

<HEAD>Wedne&s;day, <DATE>1&s;t September</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I awaked very early. I began to imagine
that the landlord, being about to emigrate,
<PB N="154" REF="160">
might murder us to get our money, and lay it
upon the &s;oldiers in the barn. Such groundle&s;s
fears will ari&s;e in the mind, before it has re|&s;umed
its vigour after &s;leep! Dr. John&s;on had
had the &s;ame kind of ideas; for he told me
afterwards, that he con&s;idered &s;o many &s;ol|diers,
having &s;een us, would be witne&s;&s;es,
&s;hould any harm be done, and that circum|&s;tance,
I &s;uppo&s;e, he con&s;idered as a &s;ecurity.
When I got up, I found him &s;ound a&s;leep in
his mi&s;erable <HI>&s;tye,</HI> I may call it, with a coloured
handkerchief tied round his head, With
difficulty could I awaken him. It reminded
me of Henry IV.'s fine &s;oliloquy on &s;leep; for
there was here as <HI>unea&s;y a pallet</HI> as the poet's
imagination could po&s;&s;ibly conceive.</P>
<P>A <HI>red-coat</HI> of the 15th regiment, whether of|ficer,
or only &s;erjeant, I could not be &s;ure,
came to the hou&s;e, in his way to the mountains
to &s;hoot deer, which it &s;eems the Laird of
Glenmori&s;on does not hinder any body to do.
Few, indeed, can do them harm. We had him
to breakfa&s;t with us. We got away about
eight. M'Queen walked &s;ome miles to give
us a convoy. He had, in 1745, joined the
Highland army at Fort Augu&s;tus, and conti|nued
in it till after the battle of Culloden. As
he narrated the particulars of that ill-advi&s;ed,
but brave attempt, I &s;everal times bur&s;t
into tears. There is a certain a&s;&s;ociation
<PB N="155" REF="161">
of ideas in my mind upon that &s;ubject, by which
I am &s;trongly affected. The very Highland
names, or the &s;ound of a bagpipe, will &s;tir my
blood, and fill me with a mixture of melancholy
and re&s;pect for courage; with pity for an un|fortunate,
and &s;uper&s;titious regard for antiquity,
and thoughtle&s;s inclination for war; in &s;hort,
with a crowd of &s;en&s;ations with which &s;ober
rationality has nothing to do.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed through Glen&s;heal, with prodi|gious
mountains on each &s;ide. We &s;aw where
the battle was fought in the year 1719. Dr.
John&s;on ownned he was now in a &s;cene of as
wild nature as he could &s;ee; but he corrected
me &s;ometimes in my inaccurate ob&s;ervations.&mdash;
&startq;There, &s;aid I, is a mountain like a cone.&endq;&mdash;
&startq;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> No, Sir. It would be called &s;o in
a book; and when a man comes to look at it,
he &s;ees it is not &s;o. It is indeed pointed at the
top; but one &s;ide of it is larger than the other.&endq;

&startq;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> No; it is no more than a con&s;ider|able
protuberance.&endq;</P>

<PB N="156" REF="162">

number of cottages being built together, as we

many miles this day without &s;eeing a hou&s;e, but
only little &s;ummer-huts, called <HI>&s;hielings.</HI> Evan
Campbell, &s;ervant to Mr. Murchi&s;on, factor to

At Auchna&s;heal, we &s;at down on a
green turf &s;eat at the end of a hou&s;e; they
brought us out two wooden di&s;hes of milk,
which we ta&s;ted. One of them was frothed
like a &s;yllabub. I &s;aw a woman preparing it
with &s;uch a &s;tick as is u&s;ed for chocolate, and
in the &s;ame manner. We had a con&s;iderable
<PB N="157" REF="163">
circle about us, men, women and children,
all M'Craas, Lord Seaforth's people. Not
one of them could &s;peak Engli&s;h. I ob&s;erved
to Dr. John&s;on, it was much the &s;ame as being
with a tribe of Indians&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Yes, Sir;
but not &s;o terrifying.&endq; I gave all who cho&s;e it,
&s;nuff and tobacco. Governor Trapaud had
made us buy a quantity at Fort Augu&s;tus, and
put them up in &s;mall parcels. I al&s;o gave each
per&s;on a bit of wheat bread, which they had
never ta&s;ted before. I then gave a penny a
piece to each child. I told Dr. John&s;on of
this; upon which he called to Jo&s;eph and our
guides, for change for a &s;hilling, and declared
that he would di&s;tribute among he children.
Upon this being announced in Er&s;e, there was
a great &s;tir; not only did &s;ome children come
running down from neighbouring huts, but I
ob&s;erved one black-haired man, who had been
with us all along, had gone off and returned,
bringing a very young child. My fellow-tra|veller
then ordered the children to be drawn up
in a row; and he dealt about his copper, and
made them and their parents all happy. The
poor M'Craas, whatever may be their pre&s;ent
&s;tate, were much thought of in the year 1715,
when there was a line in a &s;ong.</P>
<Q><L>And aw the brave M'Craas are coming<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The M'Craas, or Macraes, were &s;ince that time brought into the king's army, by the late Lord Seaforth. When they lay in Edinburgh ca&s;tle in 1778, and were ordered to embark for Jer&s;ey, they, with a number of other men in the regiment, for different rea&s;ons, but e&s;pecially an apprehen&s;ion that they were to be &s;old to the Ea&s;t India Company, though enli&s;ted not to be &s;ent out of Great-Britain without their own con&s;ent, made a determined mutiny, and encamped upon the lofty moun|tain, <HI>Arthur's &s;eat</HI> where they remained three days and three nights bidding defiance to all the force in Scotland.

<P>There was great diver&s;ity in the faces of the
circle around us: &s;ome were as black and wild
in their appearance as any American &s;avages
whatever. One woman was as comely almo&s;t
as the figure of Sapho, as we &s;ee it painted.
We a&s;ked the old woman, the mi&s;tre&s;s of the
hou&s;e where we had the milk, (which, by the
bye, Dr. John&s;on told me, for I did not ob|&s;erve
it my&s;elf, was built not of turf, but of
&s;tone,) what we &s;hould pay. She &s;aid, what
we plea&s;ed. One of our guides a&s;ked her, in
Er&s;e, if a &s;hilling was enough. She &s;aid,
&startq;Yes.&endq; But &s;ome of the men bid her a&s;k
more. This vexed me; becau&s;e it &s;hewed a

woman, however, hone&s;tly per&s;i&s;ted in her fir&s;t

would not treat men as brutes. I would let
them know why all of my clan were to have
attention paid to them. I would tell my upper
&s;ervants why, and make them tell the others.&endq;</P>
<P>We rode on well, till we came to the high
mountain called the <HI>Rattakin,</HI> by which time
both Dr. John&s;on and the hor&s;es were a good
deal fatigued. It is a terrible &s;teep to climb,
notwith&s;tanding the road is made &s;lanting along
it; however, we made it out. On the top of
it we met Captain M'Leod of Balmenoch (a
Dutch officer who had come from Sky) riding
with his &s;word &s;lung acro&s;s him. He a&s;ked,
&startq;Is this Mr. Bo&s;well?&endq; which was a proof
that we were expected. Going down the hill
on the other &s;ide was no ea&s;y ta&s;k. As Dr.
John&s;on was a great weight, the two guides
<PB N="160" REF="166">
agreed that he &s;hould ride the hor&s;es alternately.
Hay's were the two be&s;t, and the Doctor would
not ride but upon one or other of them, a black
or a brown. But, as Hay complained much, after
a&s;cending the <HI>Rattakin,</HI> the Doctor was pre|vailed
with to mount one of Va&s;s's greys. As
he rode upon it dwon hill, it did not go well;
and he grumbled. I walked on a little before,
but was exce&s;&s;ively entertained with the me|thod
taken to keep him in good humour. Hay
led the hor&s;e's head, talking to Dr. John&s;on an
much as he could; and (having heard him, in
the forenoon, expre&s;s a pa&s;toral plea&s;ure on
&s;eeing the goats browzing) ju&s;t when the Doc|tor
was uttering his di&s;plea&s;ure, the fellow
cried, with a very Highland accent, &startq;See &s;uch
pretty goats!&endq; Then he whi&s;tled, <HI>whu!</HI> and made
them jump.&mdash;Little did he conceive what Doc|tor
John&s;on was. Here now was a common
ignorant Highland hor&s;e-hirer imagining that
he could divert, as one does a child,&mdash;<HI>Dr.
Samuel John&s;on!</HI>&mdash;The ludicrou&s;ne&s;s, ab&s;urdity,
and extraordinary contra&s;t between what the
fellow fancied, and the reality, was truly
comick.</P>
<P>It grew du&s;ky; and we had a very tedious
ride for what was called five miles; but I am
&s;ure would mea&s;ure ten. We &s;poke none. I
was riding forward to the inn at Glenelg, on
the &s;hore oppo&s;ite to Sky, that I might
<PB N="161" REF="167">
take proper mea&s;ures, before Dr. John&s;on,
who was now advancing in dreary &s;ilence, Hay
leading his hor&s;e, &s;hould arrive. He called me
back with tremendous &s;hout, and was really
in a pa&s;&s;ion with me for leaving him. I told
him my intentions, but he was not &s;atisfied, and
&s;aid, &startq;Do you know, I &s;hould as &s;oon have
thought of picking a pocket, as doing &s;o.&endq;&mdash;
<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;I am diverted with you, Sir.&endq;&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, I could never be diverted with
incivility. Doing &s;uch a thing, makes one lo&s;e
confidence in him who has done it, as one can|not
tell what he may do next.&endq;&mdash;His extraor|dinary
warmth confounded me &s;o much, that I
ju&s;tified my&s;elf but lamely to him; yet my
intentions were not improper. I wi&s;hed to get
on, to &s;ee how we were to be lodged, and how
we were to get a boat; all which I thought I
could be&s;t &s;ettle my&s;elf, without his having any
trouble. To apply his great mind to minute
particulars, is wrong. It is like taking an
immen&s;e balance, &s;uch as is kept on quays for
weighing cargoes of &s;hips,&mdash;to weigh a guinea.
I knew I had neat little &s;cales, which would do
better; and that his attention to every thing
which falls in his way, and his uncommon
de&s;ire to be always, in the right, would make
him weigh, if he knew of the particulars:
it was right therefore for me to weigh them,
and let him have them only in effect. I
<PB N="162" REF="168">
however continued to ride by him finding he
wi&s;hed I &s;hould do &s;o.</P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed the barracks at <HI>Bern&eacute;ra,</HI> I looked
at them wi&s;hfully, as &s;oldiers have always every
thing in the be&s;t order. But there was only a
&s;erjeant and a few men there. We came on to
the inn at Glenelg. There was no provender for
our hor&s;es; &s;o they were &s;ent to gra&s;s, with a
man to watch them. A maid &s;hewed us up
&s;tairs into a room damp and dirty, with bare
walls, a variety of bad &s;mells, a coar&s;e black
grea&s;ly fir table, and forms of the &s;ame kind;
and out of a wretched bed &s;tarted fellow from
his &s;leep, like Edgar in King Lear, &startq;<HI>Poor
Tom's a cold.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is amu&s;ing to ob&s;erve the different images which this being pre&s;ented to Dr. John&s;on and me. The Doctor, in his JOURNEY, compares him to a <HI>Cyclops.</HI></NOTE>&endq;.</P>
<P>This inn was furni&s;hed with not a &s;ingle
article that we could either eat or drink; but
Mr. Murchi&s;on, factor to the Laird of Mac|leod
in Glenelg, &s;ent us a bottle of rum and
&s;ome &s;ugar, with a polite me&s;&s;age, to acquaint
us, that he was very &s;orry that he did not hear
of us till we had pa&s;&s;ed his hou&s;e, otherwi&s;e he
&s;hould have in&s;i&s;ted on our pa&s;&s;ing the night
there; and that, if he were not obliged to &s;et
out for Inverne&s;s early next morning, he would
have waited upon us.&mdash;Such extraordinary at|tention
from this gentleman, to entire &s;trangers,
<PB N="163" REF="169">
de&s;erves the mo&s;t honourable commemora|tion.</P>
<P>Our bad accommodation here made me un|ea&s;y,
and almo&s;t fretful. Dr. John&s;on was
calm. I &s;aid, he was &s;o from vanity.&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, Sir, it is from philo&s;ophy.&endq;&mdash;It
plea&s;ed me to &s;ee that the <HI>Rambler</HI> could prac|tice
&s;o well his own le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P>I re&s;umed the &s;ubject of my leaving him on
the road, and endeavoured to defend it better.
He was &s;till violent upon that head, and
&s;aid, &startq;Sir, had you gone on, I was thinking
that I &s;hould have returned with you to Edin|burgh,
and then have parted from you, and
never &s;poken to you more.&endq;</P>
<P>I &s;ent for fre&s;h hay, with which we made
beds for our&s;elves, each in a room equally
mi&s;erable. Like Wolfe, we had a &startq;<HI>choice of
difficulties.</HI>&endq; Dr. John&s;on made things ea&s;ier
by compari&s;on. At M'Queen's, la&s;t night, he
ob&s;erved, that few were &s;o well lodged in a
&s;hip. To-night he &s;aid, we were better than
if we had been upon the hill. He lay down
buttoned up in his great coat. I had my
&s;heets &s;pread on the hay, and my clothes and
great coat laid over me, by way of blankets.</P>

<P>I had &s;lept ill. Dr. John&s;on's anger had
affected me much. I con&s;idered that, without
any bad intention, I might &s;uddenly forfeit his
friend&s;hip. I was impatient to &s;ee him this
morning. I told him how unea&s;y he had made
me, by what he had &s;aid, and reminded him
of his own remark at Aberdeen, upon old
friend&s;hips being ha&s;tily broken off. He
owned, he had &s;poken to me in pa&s;&s;ion; that
he would not have done what he threatened;
and that, if he had, he would have been ten
times wor&s;e than I; that forming intimacies,
would indeed be &startq;limning the water,&endq; were
they liable to &s;uch &s;udden di&s;&s;olution; and
added, &startq;Let's think no more on't.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI>
&startq;Well then, Sir, I &s;hall be ea&s;y. Remember,
I am to have fair warning in ca&s;e of any quar|rel.
You are never to &s;pring a mine upon me.
It was ab&s;urd in me to believe you.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;You de&s;erved about as much, as to believe
me from night to morning.&endq;</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, we got into a boat for Sky.
It rained much when we &s;et off, but cleared up
as we advanced. One of the boatmen, who
&s;poke Engli&s;h, &s;aid, that a mile at land was
two miles at &s;ea. I then ob&s;erved, that from
Glenelg to Armidale in Sky, which was our
pre&s;ent cour&s;e, and is called twelve, was only
<PB N="165" REF="171">
$ix miles. But this he could not under&s;tand.
&startq;Well, (&s;aid Dr. John&s;on) never talk to me
of the native good &s;en&s;e of the Highlanders.
Here is a fellow who calls one mile two, and
yet cannot comprehend that twelve &s;uch ima|ginary
miles make in truth but &s;ix.&endq;</P>
<P>We reached the &s;hore of Armidale before
one o'clock. Sir Alexander M^cDonald came
down to receive us. He and his lady (formerly
Mi&s;s Bo&s;ville of York&s;hire) were then in a
hou&s;e built by a tenant at this place, which is
in the di&s;trict of Slate, the family man&s;ion here
having been burnt in Sir Donald Macdonald's
time.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of finding the head of the Macdo|nalds
&s;urrounded with his clan, and a fe&s;tive
entertainment, we had a &s;mall company, and
cannot boa&s;t of our cheer. The particulars are
minuted in my Journal, but I &s;hall not trouble
the publick with them. I &s;hall mention but
one characteri&s;tick circum&s;tance. My &s;hrewd
and hearty friend, Sir Thomas (Wentworth)
Blacket, Lady Macdonald's uncle, who had
preceded us in a vi&s;it to this chief, upon being
a&s;ked by him, if the punch bowl then upon
the table was not a very hand&s;ome one, replied,
&startq;Yes,&mdash;if it were full.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Alexander Macdonald having been an
Eton Scholar, Dr. John&s;on had formed an
opinion of him which was much dimini&s;hed
<PB N="166" REF="172">
when he beheld him in the i&s;le of Sky, where
we heard heavy complaints of rents racked,
and the people driven to emigration. Dr.
John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;It grieves me to &s;ee the chief
of a great clan appear to &s;uch di&s;advantage.
This gentleman has talents, nay &s;ome learning;
but he is totally unfit for this &s;ituation. Sir,
the Highland chiefs &s;hould not be allowed to
go farther &s;outh than Aberdeen. A &s;trong-minded
man, like his brother Sir James, may
be improved by an Engli&s;h education; but in
general, they will be tamed into in&s;ignificance.&endq;</P>
<P>I meditated an e&s;cape from this hou&s;e the
very next day; but Dr. John&s;on re&s;olved that
we &s;hould weather it out till Monday.</P>
<P>We found here Mr. Janes of Aberdeen&s;hire,
a naturali&s;t. Janes &s;aid he had been at Dr.
John&s;on's, in London, with Fergu&s;on the a&s;tro|nomer.
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;It is &s;trange that, in &s;uch

<P>This day proving wet, we &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed
our time very uncomfortably, had we not found
in the hou&s;e two che&s;ts of books, which we
eagerly ran&s;acked. After dinner, when I
alone was left at table with the few Highland
gentlemen who were of the company, having
<PB N="167" REF="173">
talked with very high re&s;pect of Sir James
Macdonald, they were all &s;o much affected as
to &s;hed tears. One of them was Mr. Donald
Macdonald, who had been lieutenant of gre|nadiers
in the Highland regiment, rai&s;ed by
Colonel Montgomery, now Earl of Eglintoune,
in the war before la&s;t; one of tho&s;e regiments
which the late Lord Chatham prided him&s;elf in
having brought &startq;from the mountains of the
North:&endq; by doing which he contributed to
extingui&s;h in the Highlands the remains of
di&s;affection to the pre&s;ent Royal Family. From
this gentleman's conver&s;ation, I fir&s;t learnt how
very popular his Colonel was among the High|landers;
of which I had &s;uch continued proofs,
during the whole cour&s;e of my Tour, that on
my return I could not help telling the noble
Earl him&s;elf, that I did not before know how
great a man he was.</P>
<P>We were advi&s;ed by &s;ome per&s;ons here to
vi&s;it Ra&s;ay, in our way to Dunvegan, the &s;eat
of the Laird of Macleod. Being informed that
the Rev. Mr. Donald M'Queen was the mo&s;t
intelligent man in Sky, and having been fa|voured
with a letter of introduction to him, by
the learned Sir James Foulis, I &s;ent it to him by
an expre&s;s, and reque&s;ted he would meet us at
Ra&s;ay; and at the &s;ame time enclo&s;ed a letter
to the Laird of Macleod, informing him that
we intended in a few days to have the honour
of waiting on him at Dunvegan.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="174">
Dr. John&s;on this day endeavoured to obtain
&s;ome knowledge of the &s;tate of the country;

Dr. John&s;on this morning tried to
bring him to our way of thinking.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Were I in your place, &s;ir, in &s;even years
I would make this an independant i&s;land. I
would roa&s;t oxen whole, and hang out a flag
as a &s;ignal to the Macdonalds to come and get
beef and whi&s;ky.&endq;&mdash;Sir Alexander was &s;till

<P>&startq;YESTERDAY's po&s;t brought me your an&s;wer to the fir&s;t letter in which I acquainted you of my illne&s;s. Your tenderne&s;s and concern upon that account are the &s;ame I have always experienced, and to which I have often owed my life. Indeed it never was in &s;o great danger as it has been lately; and though it would have been a very great comfort to me to have had you near me, yet perhaps I ought to rejoice, on your account, that you had not the pain of &s;uch a &s;pectacle. I have been now a week in Rome, and wi&s;h I could continue to give you the &s;ame good accounts of my recovery as I did in my la&s;t: but I mu&s;t own that, for three days pa&s;t, I have been in a very weak and mi&s;erable &s;tate, which however &s;eems to give no unea&s;ine&s;s to my phy&s;ician. My &s;tomach has been greatly out of order, without any vi&s;ible cau&s;e; and the palpitation does not decrea&s;e. I am told that my &s;tomach will &s;oon recover its tone, and that the palpitation mu&s;t cea&s;e in time. So I am willing to believe; and with this hope &s;upport the little remains of &s;pirits which I can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have, on the forty-&s;eventh day of &s;uch an illne&s;s. Do not imagine I have relap&s;ed;&mdash;I only recover flower than I expected. If my letter is &s;horter than u&s;ual, the cau&s;e of it is a do&s;e of phy&s;ick, which has weakened me &s;o much to day, that I am not able to write a long letter. I will make up for it next po&s;t, and remain always</P>

<P>&startq;THOUGH I did not mean to deceive you in my la&s;t letter from Rome, yet certainly you would have very little rea&s;on to conclude of the very great and con&s;tant danger I have gone through ever &s;ince that time. My life, which is &s;till almo&s;t entirely de&s;perate, did not at that time appear to me &s;o, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have repre&s;ented, in its true colours, a fact which acquires very little horror by that means, and comes with redoubled force by deception. There is no cir|cum&s;tance of danger and pain of which I have not had the experience, for a continued &s;eries of above a fortnight; during which time I have &s;ettled my affairs, after my death, with as much di&s;tinctne&s;s as the hurry and the nature of the thing could admit of. In ca&s;e of the wor&s;t, the Abb&eacute; Grant will he my executor in this part of the world, and Mr. Mackenzie in Scotland, where my object has been to make you and my younger brother as independent of the elde&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.&endq;</P>

nor to mind any thing that my &s;ecular obligatiions
and duties demanded of me, le&s;s than if I had
been en&s;ured to live fifty years more.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that though Dr. John&s;on
appeared now to be philo&s;ophically calm,
yet his genius did not &s;hine forth as in compa|nies,
where I have li&s;tened to him with admi|ration.
The vigour of his mind was, however,
&s;ufficiently manife&s;ted, by his di&s;covering no
&s;ymptoms of feeble relaxation in the dull,
&startq;weary, flat, and unprofitable&endq; &s;tate in which
we now were placed.</P>
<P>I am inclined to think that it was on this day
he compo&s;ed the following Ode upon the <HI>I&s;le of

<P>We &s;et out, accompanied by Mr. Donald
M'Leod (late of Canna) as our guide. We
rode for &s;ome time along the di&s;trict of Slate,
near the &s;hore. The hou&s;es in general are
made of turf, convered with gra&s;s. The country
&s;eemed well peopled. We came into the di|&s;trict
of Strath, and pa&s;&s;ed along a wild moori&s;h
tract of land till we arrived at the &s;hore.
There we found good verdure, and &s;ome cu|rious
whin-rocks, or collections of &s;tones like
the ruins of the foundations of old buildings.
We &s;aw al&s;o theree <HI>Cairns</HI> of con&s;iderable &s;ize.
About a mile beyond Broadfoot, is Corriecha|tachin,
a farm of Sir Alexander Macdonald's,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Mr. M'Kinnon<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">That my readers may have my narrative in the &s;tyle of the country through which I am travelling, they will plea&s;e to be informed, that the chief of a clan is denominated by his <HI>&s;urname</HI> alone, as M'Leod, M'Kinnon, M'Into&s;h. To prefix <HI>Mr.</HI> to it would be a degradation from <HI>the</HI> M'Leod, &amp;c. My old friend, the Laird of M'Farlane, the great antiquary, took it highly ami&s;s, when General Wade called him <HI>Mr.</HI> M'Far|lane. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, he could not bring him&s;elf to u&s;e this mode of addre&s;s; it &s;eemed to him to be too familiar, as it is the way in which, in all other places, intimates or infe|riors are addre&s;&s;ed. When the chiefs have <HI>titles,</HI> they are de|nominated by them, as <HI>Sir James Grant, Sir Allan M'Lean.</HI> The other Highland gentlemen, of landed property, are deno|minated by their <HI>e&s;tates,</HI> as <HI>Ra&s;ay, Boi&s;dale;</HI> and the wives of all of them have the title of <HI>ladies.</HI> The <HI>ta$k&s;men,</HI> or princi|pal tenants, are named by their farms, as <HI>King &s;burgh, Cori|chatachin;</HI> and their wives are called the <HI>mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> of King&s;|burgh, the <HI>mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> of Corichatachin.&mdash;Having given this explanation, I am at liberty to u&s;e that mode of &s;peech which generally prevails in the Highlands, and the Hebrides.</NOTE>, who received us
<PB N="176" REF="182">
with a hearty welcome, as did his wife, who
was what we call in Scotland a <HI>lady-like</HI> woman.
Mr. Pennant, in the cour&s;e of his tour to the
Hebrides, pa&s;&s;ed two nights at this gentleman's
hou&s;e. On its being mentioned, that a pre&s;ent
had here been made to him of a curious &s;peci|men
of Highland antiquity, Dr. John&s;on &s;aid,
&startq;Sir, it was more than he de&s;erved. The dog
is a Whig.&endq;</P>
<P>We here enjoyed the comfort of a table
plentifully furni&s;hed, the &s;atisfaction of which
was heightened by a numerous and cheerful
company; and we for the fir&s;t time had a &s;peci|men
of the joyous &s;ocial manners of the inhabi|tants
of the Highlands. They talked in their
own ancient language, with fluent vivacity, and
&s;ung many Er&s;e &s;ongs with &s;uch &s;pirit, that,
though Dr. John&s;on was treated with the
greate&s;t re&s;pect and attention, there were moments
in which he &s;eemed to be forgotten.
For my&s;elf, though but a <HI>Lowlander,</HI> having
picked up a few words of the language, I pre|&s;umed
to mingle in their mirth, and joined in
the choru&s;&s;es with as much glee as any of the

company. Dr. John&s;on, being fatigued with
his journey, retired early to his chamber, where
he compo&s;ed the following Ode, addre&s;&s;ed to
Mrs. Thrale:</P>

<P>Dr. John&s;on was much plea&s;ed with his
entertainment here. There were many good
books in the hou&s;e: Hector Boethius in
Latin; Cave's Lives of the Fathers; Baker's
Chronicle; Jeremy Collier's Church Hi&s;tory;
Dr. John&s;on's &s;mall Dictionary; Craufurd's
Officers of State, and &s;everal more:&mdash;a mez|zotinto
of Mrs. Brookes the actre&s;s (by &s;ome
&s;trange chance in Sky); and al&s;o a print of
Macdonald of Clanranald, with a Latin in|&s;cription
about the cruelties after the battle of
Culloden, which will never be forgotten.</P>
<P>It was a very wet &s;tormy day; &s;o we were
obliged to remain here, it being impo&s;&s;ible to
cro&s;s the &s;ea to Ra&s;ay.</P>
<P>I employed a part of the forenoon in writing
this Journal. The re&s;t of it was &s;omewhat
dreary, from the gloomine&s;s of the weather,
and the uncertain &s;tate which we were in, as
we could not tell but it might clear up every
hour. Nothing is more unea&s;y to the mind
than a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence, e&s;pecially when it
depends upon the weather, concerning which
there can be &s;o little calculation. As Dr.
John&s;on &s;aid of our wearine&s;s on the Monday
at Aberdeen, &startq;Sen&s;ation is &s;en&s;ation:&endq; Corri|chatachin,
which was la&s;t night a ho&s;pitable
<PB N="179" REF="185">
hou&s;e, was, in my mind, changed to-day into
a pri&s;on. After dinner, I read &s;ome of Dr.
Macpher&s;on's Di&s;&s;ertations on the Ancient
Caledonians. I was di&s;gu&s;ted by the un&s;a|tisfactory
conjectures as to antiquity, before
the days of record. I was happy when tea
came. Such, I take it, is the &s;tate of tho&s;e
who live in the country. Meals are wi&s;hed for
from the cravings of vacuity of mind, as well
as from the de&s;ire of eating. I was hurt to find
even &s;uch a temporary feeblene&s;s, and that I
was &s;o far from being that robu&s;t wi&s;e man
who is &s;ufficient for his own happine&s;s. I felt
a kind of lethargy of indolence. I did not
exert my&s;elf to get Dr. John&s;on to talk, that I
might not have the labour of writing down his
conver&s;ation.&mdash;He enquired here, if there were
any remains of the &s;econd &s;ight. Mr. M'Pher|&s;on,
mini&s;ter of Slate, &s;aid, he was <HI>re&s;olved</HI> not
to believe it, becau&s;e it was founded on no
principle.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;There are many things
then, which we are &s;ure are true, that you will
not believe. What principle is there, why a
load&s;tone attracts iron? why an egg produces a
chicken by heat? why a tree grows upwards,
when the natural tendency of all things is
downwards? Sir, it depends upon the degree
of evidence that you have.&endq;&mdash;Young Mr.
M'Kinnon mentioned one M'Kenzie, who is
&s;till alive, who had often fainted in his pre|&s;ence,
<PB N="180" REF="186">
and when he recovered, mentioned vi|&s;ions
which had been pre&s;ented to him. He
told Mr. M'Kinnon, that at &s;uch a place he
&s;hould meet a funeral, and that &s;uch and &s;uch
people would be the bearers, naming four;
and three weeks afterwards he &s;aw what M'Ken|zie
had predicted. The naming the very &s;pot
in a country where a funeral comes a long way,
and the very people as bearers, when there are
&s;o many out of whom a choice may be made,
&s;eems extraordinary.&mdash;We would have &s;ent for
M'Kenzie, had we not been informed that he
could &s;peak no Engli&s;h. Be&s;ides, the facts
were not related with &s;ufficient accuracy.</P>
<P>Mrs. M'Kinnon, who is a daughter of old
King&s;burgh, told us, that her father was one
day riding in Sky, and &s;ome women, who were
at work in a field on the &s;ide of the road, &s;aid
to him, they had heard two <HI>tai&s;cks,</HI> (that is, two
voices of per&s;ons about to die,) and what was
remarkable, one of them was an <HI>Engli&s;h tai&s;ck,</HI>
which they never heard before. When he re|turned,
he at that very place met two funerals,
and one of them was that of a woman who had
come from the main land, and could &s;peak
only Engli&s;h. This, &s;he remarked, made a great
impre&s;&s;ion upon her father.</P>
<P>How all the people here were lodged, I
know not. It was partly done by &s;eparating
man and wife, and putting a number of men
in one room, and of women in another.</P>

<P>When I awaked, the rain was much heavier
than ye&s;terday; but the wind had abated. By
breakfa&s;t, the day was better, and in a little
while it was calm and clear. I felt my &s;pirits
much elated. The propriety of the expre&s;&s;ion,
&startq;<HI>the &s;un&s;hine of the brea&s;t,</HI>&endq; now &s;truck me with
peculiar force; for the brilliant rays penetrated
into my very &s;oul. We were all in better hu|mour
than before. Mrs. M'Kinnon, with
unaffected ho&s;pitality and politene&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed
her happine&s;s in having &s;uch company in her
hou&s;e, and appeared to under&s;tand and reli&s;h
Dr. John&s;on's conver&s;ation, as indeed all the
company &s;eemed to do. When I knew &s;he
was old King&s;burgh's daughter, I did not
wonder at the good appearance which &s;he
made.</P>
<P>She talked as if her hu&s;band and family
would emigrate, rather than be oppre&s;&s;ed by
their landlord; and &s;aid, &startq;how agreeable
would it be, if the&s;e gentlemen &s;hould come
in upon us when we are in America.&endq;&mdash;Some|body
ob&s;erved that Sir Alexander Macdonald
was always frightened at &s;ea.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on. &startq;He</HI> is
frightened at &s;ea; and his tenants are fright|ened
when he comes to land.&endq;</P>
<P>We re&s;olved to &s;et out directly after break|fa&s;t.
We had about two miles to ride to the
<PB N="182" REF="188">
&s;ea-&s;ide, and there we expected to get one of
the boats belonging to the fleet of bounty her|ring-bu&s;&s;es
then on the coa&s;t, or at lea&s;t a good
country fi&s;hing-boat. But while we were pre|paring
to &s;et out, there arrived a man with the
following card from the Reverend Mr. Donald
M'Queen.</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. M'Queen's compliments to Mr.
Bo&s;well, and begs leave to acquaint him,
that, fearing the want of a proper boat, as
much as the rain of ye&s;terday, might have
cau&s;ed a &s;top, he is now at Skianwden with
Macgillichallum's<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Highland expre&s;&s;ion for Laird of Ra&s;ay.</NOTE> carriage&punc; to convey him
and Dr. John&s;on to Ra&s;ay, where they will
meet with a mo&s;t hearty welcome, and where
Macleod, being on a vi&s;it, now attends their
motions.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Wedne&s;day forenoon.&endq;</P>
<P>This card was mo&s;t agreeable; it was a pro|logue
to that ho&s;pitable and truly polite recep|tion
which we found at Ra&s;ay. In a little while
arrived Mr. Donald M'Queen him&s;elf; a de|cent
mini&s;ter, an elderly man with his own
black hair, courteous, and rather &s;low of
&s;peech, but candid, &s;en&s;ible and well informed,
nay learned. Along with him came, as our
pilot, a gentleman whom I had a great de&s;ire to
&s;ee, Mr. Malcolm Macleod, one of the Ra&s;ay
<PB N="183" REF="189">
family, celebrated in the year 1745-6. He was
now &s;ixty-two years of age, hale, and well pro|portioned,
&mdash;with a manly countenance, tanned
by the weather, yet having a ruddine&s;s in his
cheeks, over a great part of which his rough
beard extended;&mdash;a quick lively eye; not fierce
in his look, but at once firm and good
humoured. He wore a pair of brogues,&mdash;Tartan
ho&s;e which came up only near to his
knees, and left them bare,&mdash;a purple camblet
kilt,&mdash;a black wai&s;tcoat,&mdash;a &s;hort green cloth
coat bound with gold cord,&mdash;a yellowi&s;h bu&s;hy
wig,&mdash;a large blue bonnet with a gold thread
button. I never &s;aw a figure that was more
perfectly a repre&s;entative of a Highland gentle|man.
I wi&s;hed much to have a picture of him
ju&s;t as he was. I found him frank and <HI>polite,</HI>
in the true &s;en&s;e of the word.</P>
<P>The good family at Corichatachin &s;aid, they
hoped to &s;ee us on our return. We rode down
to the &s;hore; but Malcolm walked with grace|ful
agility.</P>
<P>We got into Ra&s;ay's <HI>carriage,</HI> which was a
good &s;trong open boat made in Norway. The
wind had now ri&s;en pretty high, and was again&s;t
us; but we had four &s;tout rowers, particularly
a Macleod, a robu&s;t, black-haired fellow,
half naked, and bare-headed, &s;omething between
a wild Indian and an Engli&s;h tar. Dr. John&s;on
&s;at high on the &s;tern, like a magnificent Triton.
<PB N="184" REF="190">
Malcolm &s;ung an Er&s;e &s;ong, the chorus of
which was &startq;<HI>Hatyin foam foam eri,</HI>&endq; with words
of his own. The tune re&s;embled &startq;<HI>Owr the
muir amang the heather.</HI>&endq; The boatmen and
Mr. M'Queen choru&s;ed, and all went well.
At length Malcolm him&s;elf took an oar, and
rowed vigorou&s;ly. We &s;ailed along the coa&s;t
of Scalpa, a rugged i&s;land, about four miles in
length. Dr. John&s;on propo&s;ed that he and I
&s;hould buy it, and found a good &s;chool, and
an epi&s;copal church, (Malcolm &s;aid, he would
come to it,) and have a printing-pre&s;s, where
he would print all the Er&s;e that could be found.</P>
<P>Here I was &s;trongly &s;truck with our long-projected
&s;cheme of vi&s;iting the Hebrides being
realized. I called to him, &startq;We are contend|ing
with &s;eas;&endq; which I think were the words
of one of his letters to me. &startq;Not much,&endq;
&s;aid he; and though the wind made the &s;ea
la&s;h con&s;iderably upon us, he was not di&s;com|po&s;ed.
After we were out of the &s;helter of
Scalpa, and in the &s;ound between it and Ra&s;ay,
which extended about a league, the wind made
the &s;ea very rough. I did not like it.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;This now is the Atlantick. If I &s;hould tell
at a tea-table in London, that I have cro&s;&s;ed
the Atlantick in an open boat, how they'd
&s;hudder, and what a fool they'd think me to
expo&s;e my&s;elf to &s;uch danger!&endq; He then re|peated
Horace's ode,</P>
<Q><PB N="185" REF="191">
<L>Otium Divos rogat in patenti</L>
<L>Pren&s;us Aegaeo&mdash;.</L></Q>
<P>In the confu&s;ion and hurry of this boi&s;terous
&s;ail, Dr. John&s;on's &s;purs, of which Jo&s;eph had
charge, were carried over-board into the &s;ea,
and lo&s;t. This was the fir&s;t misfortune that
has befallen us. Dr. John&s;on was a little angry
at fir&s;t, ob&s;erving that &startq;there was &s;omething
wild in letting a pair of &s;purs be carried into
the &s;ea out of a boat;&endq; but then he remarked,
&startq;that, as Janes the naturali&s;t had &s;aid upon
lo&s;ing his pocket-book, it was rather an incon|venience
than a lo&s;s.&endq; He told us, he now recol|lected
that he dreamt the night before, that he
put his &s;taff into a river, and chanced to let it
go, and it was carried down the &s;tream and
lo&s;t. &startq;So now you &s;ee (&s;aid he) that I have
lo&s;t my &s;purs; and this &s;tory is better than
many of tho&s;e which we have concerning
&s;econd &s;ight and dreams.&endq; Mr. M'Queen &s;aid
he did not believe the &s;econd &s;ight; that he
never met with any well atte&s;ted in&s;tances; and
if he &s;hould, he would impute them to chance;
becau&s;e all who pretend to that quality often
fail in their predictions, though they take a
great &s;cope, and &s;ometimes interpret literally,
&s;ometimes figuratively, &s;o as to &s;uit the events.
He told us, that, &s;ince he came to be mini&s;ter
of the pari&s;h where he now is, the belief of
witchcraft, or charms, was very common, in|&s;omuch
<PB N="186" REF="192">
that he had many pro&s;ecutions before
his <HI>&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> (the parochial eccle&s;ia&s;tical court)
again&s;t women, for having by the&s;e means
carried off the milk from people's cows. He
di&s;regarded them; and there is not now the
lea&s;t ve&s;tige of that &s;uper&s;tition. He preached
again&s;t it; and in order to give a &s;trong proof
to the people that there was nothing in it, he
&s;aid from the pulpit, that every woman in the
pari&s;h was welcome to take the milk from his
cows, provided &s;he did not touch them.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on a&s;ked him as to Fingal. He
&s;aid he could repeat &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the ori|ginal;
that he heard his grandfather had a copy
of it; but that he could not affirm that
O&s;&s;ian compo&s;ed all that poem as it is now pub|li&s;hed.
This came pretty much to what Dr.
John&s;on has maintained; though he goes far|ther,
and contends that it is no better than
&s;uch an epick poem as he could make from the
&s;ong of Robin Hood; that is to &s;ay, that, except
a few pa&s;&s;ages, there is nothing truly ancient
but the names and &s;ome vague traditions. Mr.
M'Queen alledged that Homer was made up of
detached fragments. Dr. John&s;on denied this;
ob&s;erving, that it had been one work originally,
and that you could not put a book of the Iliad
out of its place; and he believed the &s;ame
might be &s;aid of the Ody&s;&s;ey.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="193">
The approach to Ra&s;ay was very plea&s;ing.
We &s;aw before us a beautiful bay, well de|fended
by a rocky coa&s;t; a good family man|&s;ion;
a fine verdure about it,&mdash;with a con&s;ider|able

ob&s;erved, that naval mu&s;ick was very ancient.
As we came near the &s;hore, the &s;inging of our
rowers was &s;ucceeded by that of reapers, who
were bu&s;y at work, and who &s;eemed to &s;hout
as much as to &s;ing, while they worked with a
bounding activity. Ju&s;t as we landed, I ob|&s;erved
a cro&s;s, or rather the ruins of one, upon
a rock, which had to me a plea&s;ing ve&s;tige of
religion. I perceived a large company coming
out from the hou&s;e. We met them as we
walked up. There were Ra&s;ay him&s;elf; his
brother Dr. Macleod; his nephew the Laird
of M'Kinnon; the Laird of Macleod; Colonel
Macleod of Tali&s;ker, an officer in the Dutch
&s;ervice, a very genteel man, and a faithful
branch of the family; Mr. Macleod of Muira|ven&s;ide,
be&s;t known by the name of Sandie
Macleod, who was long in exile on account of
the part which he took in 1745; and &s;everal
other per&s;ons. We were welcomed upon the
green, and conducted into the hou&s;e, where we
were introduced to Lady Ra&s;ay, who was &s;ur|rounded
by a numerous family, con&s;i&s;ting of
<PB N="188" REF="194">
three &s;ons and ten daughters. The Laird of
Ra&s;ay is a &s;en&s;ible, polite, and mo&s;t ho&s;pitable
gentleman. I was told that his i&s;land of Ra&s;ay,
and that of Rona, (from which the elde&s;t &s;on of
the family has his title,) and a con&s;iderable ex|tent
of land which he has in Sky, do not alto|gether
yield him a very large revenue: and yet
he lives in great &s;plendour; and &s;o far is he
from di&s;tre&s;&s;ing his people, that, in the pre&s;ent
rage for emigration, not a man has left his
e&s;tate.</P>
<P>It was pa&s;t &s;ix o'clock when we arrived.
Some excellent brandy was &s;erved round imme|diately,
according to the cu&s;tom of the High|lands,
where a dram is generally taken every
day. They call it a <HI>&s;cal$h.</HI> On a &s;ide-board
was placed for us, who had come off the &s;ea,
a &s;ub&s;tantial dinner, and a variety of wines.
Then we had coffee and tea. I ob&s;erved in
the room &s;everal elegantly-bound books, and
other marks of improved life. Soon afterwards
a fidler appeared, and a little ball began.
Ra&s;ay him&s;elf danced with as much &s;pirit as
any man, and Malcolm bounded like a roe.
Sandie Macleod, who has at times an exce&s;&s;ive
flow of &s;pirits, and had it now, was, in his
days of ab&s;conding, known by the name of
<HI>M'Cru&s;lick,</HI> which it &s;eems was the de&s;ignation
of a kind of wild man in the Highlands, &s;ome|thing
between Proteus and Don Quixotte; and
<PB N="189" REF="195">
&s;o he was called here. He made much jovial
noi&s;e. Dr. John&s;on was &s;o delighted with this
&s;cene, that he &s;aid, &startq;I know not how we &s;hall
get away.&endq; It entertained me to ob&s;erve him
&s;itting by, while we danced, &s;ometimes in deep
meditation,&mdash;&s;ometimes &s;miling complacently,
&mdash;&s;ometimes looking upon Hooke's Roman
Hi&s;tory,&mdash;and &s;ometimes talking a little,
amid&s;t the noi&s;e of the ball, to Mr. Donald
M'Queen, who anxiou&s;ly gathered knowledge
from him. He was plea&s;ed with M'Queen,
and &s;aid to me, &startq;This is a critical man, Sir.
There mu&s;t be great vigour of mind to make
him cultivate learning &s;o much in the i&s;le of
Sky, where he might do without it. It is won|derful
how many of the new publications he
has. There mu&s;t be a &s;natch of every oppor|tunity.&endq;
Mr. M'Queen told me that his bro|ther
(who is the fourth generation of the family
following each other as mini&s;ters of the pari&s;h
of Snizort) and he joined together, and bought
from time to time &s;uch books as had reputation.
Soon after we came in, a black cock and grey
hen, which had been &s;hot, were &s;hewn, with
their feathers on, to Dr. John&s;on, who had
never &s;een that &s;pecies of bird before. We had
a company of thirty at &s;upper; and all was
good humour and gaiety, without intempe|rance.</P>

<HEAD>Thur&s;day, <DATE>9th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>At breakfa&s;t this morning, among a profu|&s;ion
of other things, there were oat-cakes,
made of what is called <HI>graddaned</HI> meal, that is,
meal made of grain &s;eparated from the hu&s;ks,
and toa&s;ted by fire, in&s;tead of being thre&s;hed
and kiln-dried. This &s;eems to be bad ma|nagement,
as &s;o much fodder is con&s;umed by
it. Mr. M'Queen however defended it, by
&s;aying, that it is doing the thing much quicker,
as one operation &s;erves what is otherwi&s;e done
by two. His chief rea&s;on however was, that
the &s;ervants in Sky are, according to him, a
faithle&s;s pack, and &s;teal what they can; &s;o that
much is &s;aved by the corn pa&s;&s;ing but once
through their hands, as at each time they pilfer
&s;ome. It appears to me, that the gradaning is
a &s;trong proof of the lazine&s;s of the Highlanders:
who will rather make fire act for them, at the
expence of fodder, than labour them&s;elves.
There was al&s;o, what I cannot help di&s;liking at
breakfa&s;t, chee&s;e: it is the cu&s;tom over all the
Highlands to have it; and it often &s;mells very
&s;trong, and poi&s;ons to a certain degree the ele|gance
of an Indian repa&s;t. The day was
&s;howery; however, Ra&s;ay and I took a walk,
and had &s;ome cordial conver&s;ation. I conceived
a more than ordinary regard for this worthy
gentleman. His family has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this
<PB N="191" REF="197">
i&s;land above four hundred years. It is the re|mains
of the e&s;tate of Macleod of Lewis, whom
he repre&s;ents.&mdash;When we returned, Dr. John&s;on
walked with us to &s;ee the old chapel. He was
in fine &s;pirits. He &s;aid, &startq;This is truly the
patriarchal life: this is what we came to find.&endq;</P>
<P>After dinner, M'Cru&s;lick, Malcolm, and I,
went out with guns, to try if we could find any
black-cock; but we had no &s;port, owing to a
heavy rain. I &s;aw here what is called a Dani&s;h
fort. Our evening was pa&s;&s;ed as la&s;t night was.
One of our company, I was told, had hurt
him&s;elf by too much &s;tudy, particularly of
infidel metaphy&s;icians, of which he gave a
proof, on &s;econd &s;ight being mentioned. He
immediately retailed &s;ome of the fallacious ar|guments
of Voltaire and Hume again&s;t miracles
in general. Infidelity in a Highland gentle|man
appeared to me peculiarly offen&s;ive. I
was &s;orry for him, as he had otherwi&s;e a good
character. I told Dr. John&s;on that he had &s;tudied
him&s;elf into infidelity.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Then he
mu&s;t &s;tudy him&s;elf out of it again. That is
the way. Drinking largely will &s;ober him
again.&endq;</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>10th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Having re&s;olved to explore the i&s;land of
Ra&s;ay, which could be done only on foot, I
the la&s;t night obtained my fellow traveller's
<PB N="192" REF="198">
permi&s;&s;ion to leave him for a day, he being
unable to take &s;o hardy a walk. Old Mr.
Malcolm M'Cleod, who had obligingly pro|mi&s;ed
to accompany me, was at my bed&s;ide
between five and &s;ix. I &s;prang up immediately,
and he and I, attended by two other gentle|men,
traver&s;ed the country during the whole
of this day. Though we had pa&s;&s;ed over not
le&s;s than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged
ground, and had a Highland dance on the top
of <HI>Dun Can,</HI> the highe&s;t mountain in the i&s;land,
we returned in the evening not at all fatigued,
and piqued our&s;elves at not being outdone at
the nightly ball by our le&s;s active friends, who
had remained at home.</P>
<P>My &s;urvey of Ra&s;ay did not furni&s;h much
which can intere&s;t my readers; I &s;hall therefore
put into as &s;hort a compa&s;s as I can, the ob&s;er|vations
upon it, which I find regi&s;tered in my
Journal. It is about fifteen Engli&s;h miles
long, and four broad. On the &s;outh &s;ide is
the laird's family &s;eat, &s;ituated on a plea&s;ing
low &s;pot. The old tower of three &s;tories,
mentioned by Martin, was taken down &s;oon
after 1746, and a modern hou&s;e &s;upplies its
place. There are very good gra&s;s fields and
corn lands about it, well dre&s;&s;ed. I ob&s;erved,
however, hardly any inclo&s;ures, except a good
garden plentifully &s;tocked with vegetables, and
&s;trawberries, ra&s;pberries, currants, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="199">
Of one of the rocks ju&s;t where we landed,
which are not high, there is rudely carved
a &s;quare, with a crucifix in the middle. Here,
it is &s;aid, the Lairds of Ra&s;ay, in old times,
u&s;ed to offer up their devotions. I could not
approach the &s;pot, without a grateful recol|lection
of the event commemorated by this
&s;ymbol.</P>
<P>A little from the &s;hore, we&s;tward, is a kind
of &s;ubterraneous hou&s;e. There has been a na|tural
fi&s;&s;ure, or &s;eparation of the rock, running
towards the &s;ea, which has been roofed over
with long &s;tones, and above them turf has been
laid. In that place the inhabitants u&s;ed to
keep their oars. There are a number of trees
near the hou&s;e, which grow well; &s;ome of
them of a pretty good &s;ize. They are mo&s;tly
plane and a&s;h. A little to the we&s;t of the
hou&s;e is an old ruinous chapel, unroofed, which
never has been very curious. We here &s;aw
&s;ome human bones of an uncommon &s;ize.
There was a heel-bone, in particular, which
Dr. M'Leod &s;aid was &s;uch, that, if the foot
was in proportion, it mu&s;t have been twenty-&s;even
inches long. Dr. John&s;on would not
look at the bones. He &s;tarted back from them
with a &s;triking appearance of horrour. Mr.
M'Queen told us, it was formerly much the
cu&s;tom, in the&s;e i&s;les, to have human bones
lying above ground, e&s;pecially in the windows
<PB N="194" REF="200">
of churches. On the &s;outh of the chapel is
the family burying-place. Above the door, on
the ea&s;t end of it, is a &s;mall bu&s;t or image of
the Virgin Mary, carved upon a &s;tone which
makes part of the wall. There is no church
upon the i&s;land. It is annexed to one of the
pari&s;hes of Sky, and the mini&s;ter comes and
preaches either in Ra&s;ay's hou&s;e, or &s;ome other
hou&s;e, on certain Sundays. I could not but
value the family &s;eat more, for having even the
ruins of a chapel clo&s;e to it. There was &s;ome|thing
comfortable in the thought of being &s;o
near a piece of con&s;ecrated ground. Dr. John|&s;on
&s;aid, &startq;I look with reverence upon every
place that has been &s;et apart for religion;&endq; and
he kept off his hat while he was within the walls
of the chapel.</P>
<P>The eight cro&s;&s;es, which Martin mentions as
pyramids for decea&s;ed ladies, &s;tood in a &s;emi|circular
line, which contained within it the
chapel. They marked out the boundaries of
the &s;acred territory within which an a&s;ylum
was to be had. One of them, which we ob|&s;erved
upon our landing, made the fir&s;t point
of the &s;emicircle. There are few of them now
remaining. A good way farther north, there
is a row of buildings about four feet high:
they run from the &s;hore on the ea&s;t along the
top of a pretty high eminence, and &s;o down to
the &s;hore on the we&s;t, in much the &s;ame direc|tion
<PB N="195" REF="201">
with the cro&s;&s;es. Ra&s;ay took them to be
the marks for the a&s;ylum; but Malcolm
thought them to be fal&s;e &s;entinels, a common
deception, of which in&s;tances occur in Martin,
to make invaders imagine an i&s;land better
guarded. Mr. Donald M'Queen, ju&s;tly in my
opinion, &s;uppo&s;ed the cro&s;&s;es which form the
inner circle to be the church's land-marks.</P>
<P>The &s;outh end of the i&s;land is much covered
with large &s;tones, or rocky &s;trata. The laird
has enclo&s;ed and planted part of it with firs,
and he &s;hewed me a con&s;iderable &s;pace marked
out for additional plantations.</P>
<P><HI>Dun Can</HI> is a mountain three computed miles
from the laird's hou&s;e. The a&s;cent to it is by
con&s;ecutive ri&s;ings, if that expre&s;&s;ion may be
u&s;ed when vallies intervene, &s;o that there is
but a &s;hort ri&s;e at once; but it is certainly very
high above the &s;ea. The palm of altitude is
di&s;puted for by the people of Ra&s;ay and tho&s;e
of Sky; the former contending for Dun Can,
the latter for the mountains in Sky, over-again&s;t
it. We went up the ea&s;t &s;ide of Dun
Can pretty ea&s;ily. It is mo&s;tly rocks all around,
the points of which hem the &s;ummit of it.
Sailors, to whom it is a good object as they
pa&s;s along, call it Ra&s;ay's cap. Before we
reached this mountain, we pa&s;&s;ed by two lakes.
Of the fir&s;t, Malcolm told me a &s;trange fabu|lous
tradition. He &s;aid, there was a wild
<PB N="196" REF="202">
bea&s;t in it, a &s;ea-hor&s;e, which came and de|voured
a man's daughter; upon which the
man lighted a great fire, and had a &s;ow roa&s;ted
at it, the &s;mell of which attracted the mon&s;ter.
In the fire was put a &s;pit. The man lay con|cealed
behind a low wall of loo&s;e &s;tones,
and he had an avenue formed for the mon&s;ter,
with two rows of large flat &s;tones, which
extended from the fire over the &s;ummit of
the hill, till it reached the &s;ide of the loch.
The mon&s;ter came, and the man with the red|hot
&s;pit de&s;troyed it. Malcolm &s;hewed me the
little hiding place, and the rows of &s;tones. He
did not laugh when he told this &s;tory. I recol|lect
having &s;een in the Scots Magazine, &s;everal
years ago, a poem upon a &s;imilar tale, per|haps
the &s;ame, tran&s;lated from the Er&s;e, or
Iri&s;h, called <HI>Albin and the Daughter of Mey.</HI></P>
<P>There is a large tract of land, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as a
common, in Ra&s;ay. They have no regulations
as to the number of cattle. Every man puts
upon it as many as he choo&s;es. From Dun-Can
northward, till you reach the other end of the
i&s;land, there is much good natural pa&s;ture
unencumbered by &s;tones. We pa&s;&s;ed over a
&s;pot, which is appropriated for the exerci&s;ing
ground. In 1745, a hundred fighting men
were reviewed here, as Malcolm told me, who
was one of the officers that led them to the
field. They returned home all but about four|teen.
<PB N="197" REF="203">
What a princely thing is it to be able
to furni&s;h &s;uch a band! Ra&s;ay has the true
&s;pirit of a chief. He is, without exaggeration,
a father to his people.</P>
<P>There is plenty of lime-&s;tone in the i&s;land,
a great quarry of free-&s;tone, and &s;ome natural
woods, but none of any age, as they cut the
trees for common country u&s;es. The lakes, of
which there are many, are well &s;tocked with
trout. Malcolm catched one of four-and-twenty
pounds weight in the loch next to Dun-Can,
which, by the way, is certainly a Dani&s;h
name, as mo&s;t names of places in the&s;e i&s;lands
are.</P>
<P>The old ca&s;tle, in which the family of Ra&s;ay
formerly re&s;ided, is &s;ituated upon a rock very
near the &s;ea. The rock is not one ma&s;s of
&s;tone, but a concretion of pebbles and earth,
&s;o firm that it does not appear to have moul|dered.
In this remnant of antiquity I found
nothing worthy of being noticed, except a
certain accommodation rarely to be found at
the modern hou&s;es of Scotland, and which Dr.
John&s;on and I fought for in vain at the Laird
of Ra&s;ay's new-built man&s;ion, where nothing
el&s;e was wanting. I took the liberty to tell
the Laird it was a &s;hame there &s;hould be &s;uch
a deficiency in civilized times. He acknow|ledged
the ju&s;tice of the remark. But perhaps
&s;ome generations may pa&s;s before the want is
<PB N="198" REF="204">
&s;upplied. Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved to me, how
quietly people will endure an evil, which they
might at any time very ea&s;ily remedy; and
mentioned as an in&s;tance, that the pre&s;ent
family of Ra&s;ay had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the i&s;land for
more than four hundred years, and never made
a commodious landing place, though a few
men with pickaxes might have cut an a&s;cent of
&s;tairs out of any part of the rock in a week's
time.</P>
<P>The north end of Ra&s;ay is as rocky as the
&s;outh end. From it I &s;aw the little i&s;le of
Fladda, belonging to Ra&s;ay, all fine green
ground;&mdash;and Rona, which is of &s;o rocky a
&s;oil that it appears to be a pavement. I was
told however that it has a great deal of gra&s;s,
in the inter&s;tices. The Laird has it all in his
own hands. At this end of the i&s;land of Ra&s;ay, is
a cave in a &s;triking &s;ituation. It is in a rece&s;s of
a great cleft, a good way up from the &s;ea.
Before it the ocean roars, being da&s;hed again&s;t
mon&s;trous broken rocks; grand and aweful
<HI>propugnacula.</HI> On the right hand of it is a
longitudinal cave, very low at the entrance,
but higher as you advance. The &s;ea having
&s;cooped it out, it &s;eems &s;trange and unaccount|able
that the interior part, where the water
mu&s;t have operated with le&s;s force, &s;hould be
loftier than that which is more immediately
expo&s;ed to its violence. The roof of it is all
<PB N="199" REF="205">
covered with a kind of petrifications formed by
drops, which perpetually di&s;til from it. The
fir&s;t cave have been a place of much &s;afety.&mdash;I
find a great difficulty in de&s;cribing vi&s;ible ob|jects.
I mu&s;t own too that the old ca&s;tle and
cave, like many other things, of which one
hears much, did not an&s;wer my expectations.
People are every where apt to magnify the cu|rio&s;ities
of their country.</P>
<P>This i&s;land has abundance of black cattle,
&s;heep, and goats;&mdash;a good many hor&s;es, which
are u&s;ed for plowing, carrying out dung, &amp;c.
I believe the people never ride. There are
indeed no roads through the i&s;land, unle&s;s a
few detached beaten tracks de&s;erve that name.
Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are upon the &s;hore; &s;o that
all the people have little boats, and catch fi&s;h.
There is great plenty of potatoes here. There
are blackcock in extraordinary abundance, moor|fowl,
plover, and wild pigeons, which &s;eemed
to me to be the &s;ame as we have in pigeon-hou&s;es,
in their &s;tate of nature. Ra&s;ay has no
pigeon-hou&s;e. There are no hares nor rabbits
in the i&s;land, nor was there ever known to be a
fox, till la&s;t year, when one was landed on it
by &s;ome malicious per&s;on, without who&s;e aid
he could not have got thither, as that animal
is known to be a very bad &s;wimmer. He has
done much mi&s;chief. There is a great deal of
fi&s;h caught in the &s;ea around Ra&s;ay; it is a
<PB N="200" REF="206">
place where one may live in plenty, and even
in luxury. There are no deer; but Ra&s;ay told
us he would get &s;ome.</P>
<P>They reckon it rains nine months in the
year in this i&s;land, owing to its being directly
oppo&s;ite to the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Sky, where
the watery clouds are broken by high moun|tains.
The hills here, and indeed all the
heathy grounds in general, abound with the
&s;weet-&s;melling plant which the Highlanders call
<HI>gaul,</HI> and (I think) with dwarf juniper in many
places. There is enough of turf, which is their
fewel, and it is thought there is a mine of coal.
&mdash;Such are the ob&s;ervations which I made upon
the i&s;land of Ra&s;ay, upon comparing it with
the de&s;cription given by Martin, who&s;e book
we had with us.</P>
<P>There has been an ancient league between
the families of Macdonald and Ra&s;ay. When|ever
the head of either family dies, his &s;word is
given to the head of the other. The pre&s;ent
Ra&s;ay has the late Sir James Macdonald's
&s;word. Old Ra&s;ay joined the Highland army
in 1745, but prudently guarded again&s;t a for|feiture,
by previou&s;ly conveying his e&s;tate to
the pre&s;ent gentleman, his elde&s;t &s;on. On that
occa&s;ion, Sir Alexander, father of the late Sir
James Macdonald, was very friendly to his
neighbour. &startq;Don't be afraid, Ra&s;ay, &s;aid he;
I'll u&s;e all my intere&s;t to keep you &s;afe; and if
<PB N="201" REF="207">
your e&s;tate &s;hould be taken, I'll buy it for the
family.&endq;&mdash;And he would have done it.</P>
<P>Let me now gather &s;ome gold du&s;t,&mdash;&s;ome
more fragments of Dr. John&s;on's conver&s;ation,
without regard to order of time. He &s;aid, &startq;he
thought very highly of Bentley; that no man
now went &s;o far in the kinds of learning that he
cultivated; that the many attacks on him were
owing to envy, and to a de&s;ire of being known,
by being in competition with &s;uch a man; that
it was &s;afe to attack him, becau&s;e he never an|&s;wered
his opponents, but let them die away.
It was attacking a man who would not beat
them, becau&s;e his beating them would make
them live the longer. And he was right not to
an&s;wer; for, in his hazardous method of writ|ing,
he could not but be often enough wrong;
&s;o it was better to leave things to their general
appearance, than own him&s;elf to have erred in
particulars.&endq;&mdash;He &s;aid, &startq;Mallet was the pret|tie&s;t
dre&s;t puppet about town, and always kept
good company. That, from his way of talking,
he &s;aw, and always &s;aid, that he had not written
any part of the Life of the Duke of Marlbo|rough,
though perhaps he intended to do it at
&s;ome time, in which ca&s;e he was not culpable in
taking the pen&s;ion. That he imagined the
Duche&s;s furni&s;hed the materials for her Apo|logy,

had not &s;uperior parts, but was a bold frontle&s;s

&s;um of money for writing her Apology. That
he wondered Hooke &s;hould have been weak
enough to in&s;ert &s;o profligate a maxim, as that
to tell another's &s;ecret to one's friend, is no
breach of confidence; though perhaps Hooke,
who was a virtuous man, as his <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> &s;hews,
and did not wi&s;h her well, though he wrote
her Apology, might &s;ee its ill tendency, and
yet in&s;ert it at her de&s;ire. He was acting
only mini&s;terially.&endq;&mdash;I apprehend, however,
that Hooke was bound to give his be&s;t advice.
I &s;peak as a lawyer. Though I have had clients
who&s;e cau&s;es I could not, as a private man,
approve; yet, if I undertook them, I would
not do any thing that might be prejudicial to
them, even at their de&s;ire, without warning

<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>11th September</DATE></HEAD>
<P>It was a &s;torm of wind and rain; &s;o we could
not &s;et out. I wrote &s;ome of this Journal, and
talked awhile with Dr. John&s;on in his room,
and pa&s;&s;ed the day, I cannot well &s;ay how, but
very plea&s;antly. I was here amu&s;ed to find
Mr. Cumberland's comedy of the <HI>We&s;t-Indian,</HI>
in which he has very well drawn a Highland cha|racter,
Colin M'Cleod, of the &s;ame name with
<PB N="203" REF="209">
the family under who&s;e roof we now were.
Dr. John&s;on was much plea&s;ed with the Laird
of Macleod, who is indeed a mo&s;t promi&s;ing
youth, and with a noble &s;pirit &s;truggles with
difficulties, and endeavours to pre&s;erve his
people. He has been left with an incumbrance
of forty thou&s;and pounds debt, and annuities
to the amount of thirteen hundred pounds
a year. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;If he gets the
better of all this, he'll be a hero; and I hope
he will. I have not met with a young man
who had more de&s;ire to learn, or who has learnt
more. I have &s;een nobody that I wi&s;h more to
do a kindne&s;s to than Macleod.&endq;&mdash;Such was the
honourable elogium, on this young chieftain,
pronounced by an accurate ob&s;erver, who&s;e
prai&s;e was never lightly be&s;towed.</P>
<P>There is neither ju&s;tice of peace, nor con|&s;table,
in Ra&s;ay. Sky has Mr. M'Cleod of
Ulini&s;h, who is the &s;heriff &s;ub&s;titute, and no
other ju&s;tice of peace. The want of the exe|cution
of ju&s;tice is much felt among the
i&s;landers. Macleod very &s;en&s;ibly ob&s;erved, that
taking away the heritable juri&s;dictions had not
been of &s;uch &s;ervice in the i&s;lands as was ima|gined.
They had not authority enough in lieu
of them. What could formerly have been
&s;ettled at once, mu&s;t now either take much
time and trouble, or be neglected. Dr. John|&s;on
&s;aid, &startq;A country is in a bad &s;tate, which
is governed only by laws; becau&s;e a thou&s;and
<PB N="204" REF="210">
things occur for which laws cannot provide,
and where authority ought to interpo&s;e. Now
de&s;troying the authority of the chiefs &s;et the
people loo&s;e. It did not pretend to bring any
po&s;itive good, but only to cure &s;ome evil; and
I am not well enough acquainted with the
country to know what degree of evil the heri|table
juri&s;dictions occa&s;ioned.&endq;&mdash;I maintained
hardly any; becau&s;e the chiefs generally acted
right, for their own &s;akes.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on was now wi&s;hing to move.
There was not enough of intellectual entertain|ment
for him, after he had &s;atisfied his curio|&s;ity,
which he did, by a&s;king que&s;tions, till he
had exhau&s;ted the i&s;land; and where there was
&s;o numerous a company, mo&s;tly young people,
there was &s;uch a flow of familiar talk, &s;o much
noi&s;e, and &s;o much &s;inging and dancing, that
little opportunity was left for his energetic con|ver&s;ation.
He &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of this; for
when I told him how happy they were at having
him there, he &s;aid, &startq;Yet we have not been
able to entertain them much.&endq;&mdash;I was fretted,
from irritability of nerves, by M'Cru&s;lick's
too ob&s;treporous mirth. I complained of it to
my friend, ob&s;erving we &s;hould be better if
he was gone.&mdash;&startq;No, Sir, &s;aid he. He puts
&s;omething into our &s;ociety, and takes nothing
out of it.&endq;&mdash;Dr. John&s;on, however, had &s;everal
opportunities of in&s;tructing the company; but
<PB N="205" REF="211">
I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that I did not pay &s;ufficient
attention to what pa&s;&s;ed, as his di&s;cour&s;e now
turned chiefly on mechanicks, agriculture, and
&s;uch &s;ubjects, rather than on &s;cience and wit.&mdash;
La&s;t night Lady Ra&s;ay &s;hewed him the opera|tion
of <HI>wawking</HI> cloth, that is, thickening it in
the &s;ame manner as is done by a mill. Here it is
performed by women, who kneel upon the
ground, and rub it with both their hands, &s;ing|ing
an Er&s;e &s;ong all the time. He was a&s;king
que&s;tions while they were performing this ope|ration,
and, amid&s;t their loud and wild howl,
his voice was heard even in the room above.</P>
<P>They dance here every night. The queen
of our ball was the elde&s;t mi&s;s Macleod, of
Ra&s;ay, an elegant well-bred woman, and cele|brated
for her beauty over all tho&s;e regions, by
the name of Mi&s;s Flora Ra&s;ay<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">She had been &s;ome time at Edinburgh, to which &s;he again went, and was married to my worthy neighbour, Colonel Mure Campbell, now Earl of Loudoun; but &s;he died &s;oon afterwards, leaving one daughter.</NOTE> There &s;eemed
to be no jealou&s;y, no di&s;content among them,
and the gaiety of the &s;cene was &s;uch, that I for
a moment doubted whether unhappine&s;s had
any place in Ra&s;ay. But my delu&s;ion was &s;oon
di&s;pelled, by recollecting the following lines of
my fellow-traveller:</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Yet hope not life from pain or danger free,</L>
<L>Or think the doom of man revers'd for thee!&endq;</L></Q>

<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>12th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>It was a beautiful day, and although we did
not approve of travelling on Sunday, we re&s;olved
to &s;et out, as we were in an i&s;land, from whence
one mu&s;t take occa&s;ion as it &s;erves. Macleod
and Tali&s;ker &s;ailed in a boat of Ra&s;ay's for
Scon&s;er, to take the &s;horte&s;t way to Dunvegan.
M'Cru&s;$ick went with them to Scon&s;er, from
whence he was to go to Slate, and &s;o to the
main land. We were re&s;olved to pay a vi&s;it at
King&s;burgh, and &s;ee the celebrated Mi&s;s Flor$
Macdonald, who is married to the pre&s;ent Mr.
Macdonald of King&s;burgh; &s;o took that road,
though not &s;o near. All the family, but Lady
Ra&s;ay, walked down to the &s;hore to &s;ee us de|part.
Ra&s;ay him&s;elf went with us in a large
boat, with eight oars, built in his i&s;land; as
did Mr. Malcolm M'Cleod, Mr. Donald
M'Queen, Dr. Macleod, and &s;ome others.
We had a mo&s;t plea&s;ant &s;ail between Ra&s;ay and
Sky; and pa&s;&s;ed by a cave, where Martin &s;ays
fowls were catched by lighting fire in the
mouth of it. Malcolm remembers this. But
it is not now practi&s;ed, as few fowls come into
it.</P>
<P>We &s;poke of death. Dr. John&s;on on this
&s;ubject ob&s;erved, that the boa&s;tings of &s;ome
men, as to dying ea&s;ily, were idle talk, pro|ceeding
from partial views. I mentioned
<PB N="207" REF="213">
Hawthornden's Cypre&s;s-grove, where it is &s;aid
that the world is a mere &s;how; and that it is un|rea&s;onable
for a man to wi&s;h to continue in the
&s;how-room, after he has &s;een it. Let him go
cheerfully out, and give place to other &s;pecta|tors.
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on,</HI> &startq;Yes, Sir, if he is &s;ure he is
to be well, after he goes out of it. But if he
is to grow blind after he goes out of the &s;how|room,
and never to &s;ee any thing again; or if
he does not know whither he is to go next, a
man will not go cheerfully out of a &s;how-room.
No wi&s;e man will be contented to die, if he
thinks he is to go into a &s;tate of puni&s;hment.
Nay, no wi&s;e man will be contented to die, if
he thinks he is to fall into annihilation: for
however unhappy any man's exi&s;tence may
be, he yet would rather have it, than not
exi&s;t at all. No; there is no rational principle
by which a man can die contented, but a tru&s;t
in the mercy of GOD, through the merits of
Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&endq;&mdash;This &s;hort &s;ermon, delivered
with an earne&s;t tone, in a boat upon the &s;ea,
which was perfectly calm, on a day appropriated
to religious wor&s;hip, while every one li&s;tened
with an air of &s;atisfaction, had a mo&s;t plea&s;ing
effect upon my mind.</P>
<P>Pur&s;uing the &s;ame train of &s;erious reflection,
he added, that it &s;eemed certain that happine&s;s
could not be found in this life, becau&s;e &s;o
many had tried to find it, in &s;uch a variety of
ways, and had not found it.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="214">
We reached the harbour of Portree, in Sky,
which is a large and good one. There was ly|ing
in it a ve&s;&s;el to carry off the emigrants,
called the <HI>Ne&s;tor.</HI> It made a &s;hort &s;ettlement of
the differences between a chief and his clan:</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;<HI>Ne&s;tor</HI> componere lites</L>
<L>Inter Peleiden fe&s;tinat &amp; inter Atriden.</L></Q>
<P>We approached her, and &s;he hoi&s;ted her co|lours.
Dr. John&s;on and Mr. M'Queen re|mained
in the boat. Ra&s;ay and I, and the re&s;t,
went on board of her. She was a very pretty
ve&s;&s;el, and, as we were told, the large&s;t in
Clyde. Mr. Harri&s;on, the captain, &s;hewed her
to us. The cabin was commodious, and even
elegant. There was a little library, finely
bound. <HI>Portree</HI> has its name from King
James V. having landed there in his tour
through the We&s;tern I&s;les, <HI>Ree</HI> in Er&s;e being
King, as <HI>Re</HI> is in Italian; &s;o it is <HI>Port-royal.</HI>
There was here a tolerable inn. On our land|ing,
I had the plea&s;ure of finding a letter from
home; and there were al&s;o letters to Dr. John|&s;on
and me from Lord Elibank, which had
been &s;ent after us from Edinburgh.&mdash;His lord|&s;hip's
letter to me was as follows:</P>

<P>&startq;I flew to Edinburgh the moment I

highe&s;t veneration; for that very rea&s;on I was

guilt, of enticing him to honour this country

<P>At Portree, Mr. Donald M'Queen went to
church and officiated in er&s;e, and then came
to dinner. Dr. John&s;on and I re&s;olved that we
&s;hould treat the company; &s;o I played the land|lord,
or ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t, having previou&s;ly
ordered Jo&s;eph to pay the bill.</P>
<P>Sir James Macdonald intended to have built
a village here, which would have done great
good. A village is like a heart to a country.
It produces a perpetual circulation, and gives
the people an opportunity to make profit of
many little articles, which would otherwi&s;e be
in a good mea&s;ure lo&s;t. We had here a dinner,
<HI>et praeterea nihil.</HI> Dr. John&s;on talked none.
When we were about to depart, we found that
Ra&s;ay had been before-hand with us, and that
all was paid; I would fain have conte&s;ted this
matter with him; but &s;eeing him re&s;olved, I
declined it. We parted with cordial embraces
from him and worthy Malcolm. In the even|ing
Dr. John&s;on and I remounted our hor&s;es,
accompanied by Mr. M'Queen and Dr.
Macleod. It rained very hard. We rode
what they call &s;ix miles, upon Ra&s;ay's lands in
Sky, to Dr. Macleod's hou&s;e. On the road Dr.
John&s;on appeared to be &s;omewhat out of &s;pirits.
When I talked of our meeting Lord Elibank,
he &s;aid, &startq;I cannot be with him much. I
long to be again in civilized life; but can &s;tay
but a &s;hort while&endq; (he meant at Edin|burgh).
<PB N="213" REF="219">
He &s;aid, &startq;let us go to Dunvegan
to-morrow.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Yes, (&s;aid I,) if it is not a
deluge.&endq;&mdash;&startq;At any rate,&endq; he replied&mdash;This
&s;hewed a kind of fretful impatience; nor was it
to be wondered at, con&s;idering our di&s;agree|able
ride. I feared he would give up Mull
and Icolmhill, for he &s;aid &s;omething of his
apprehen&s;ions of being detained by bad wea|ther
in going to Mull and <HI>Iona.</HI> However I
hoped well. We had a di&s;h of tea at Dr.
Macleod's, who had a pretty good hou&s;e,
where was his brother, a half-pay officer. His
lady was a polite, agreeable woman. Dr.
John&s;on &s;aid, he was glad to &s;ee that he was
&s;o well married, for he had an e&s;teem for phy|&s;icians.
The doctor accompanied us to Kings|burgh,
which is called a mile farther; but the
computation of Sky has no connection what|ever
with the real di&s;tance.</P>
<P>I was highly plea&s;ed to &s;ee Dr. John&s;on &s;afely
arrived at King&s;burgh, and received by the
ho&s;pitable Mr. Macdonald, who, with a mo&s;t
re&s;pectful attention, &s;upported him into the
hou&s;e. King&s;burgh was compleatly the figure
of a gallant Highlander,&mdash;exhibiting &startq;the
graceful mien, and manly looks,&endq; which
our popular Scots &s;ong has ju&s;tly attributed to
that character. He had his Tartan plaid
thrown about him, a large blue bonnet with a
knot of black ribband like a cockade, a brown
&s;hort coat of a kind of duffil, a Tartan wai&s;t|coat
<PB N="214" REF="220">
with gold buttons and gold button-holes,
a blui&s;h philibeg, and Tartan ho&s;e. He had
jet black hair tied behind, and was a large
&s;tately man, with a &s;teady &s;en&s;ible countenance.</P>
<P>There was a comfortable parlour with a good
fire, and a dram went round. By and by &s;up|per
was &s;erved, at which there appeared the
lady of the hou&s;e, the celebrated Mi&s;s Flora
Macdonald. She is a little woman, of a gen|teel
appearance, and uncommonly mild and
well-bred. To &s;ee Dr. Samuel John&s;on, the
great champion of the Engli&s;h Tories, &s;alute
Mi&s;s Flora Macdonald in the i&s;le of Sky, was
a &s;triking &s;ight; for though &s;omewhat conge|nial
in their notions, it was very improbable
they &s;hould meet here.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Flora Macdonald (for &s;o I &s;hall call
her) told me, &s;he heard upon the main land,
as &s;he was returning to Sky about a fortnight
before, that Mr. Bo&s;well was coming to Sky,
and one Mr. John&s;on, a young Engli&s;h buck,
with him. He was highly entertained with
this fancy. Giving an account of the afternoon
which we pa&s;t at <HI>Anock,</HI> he &s;aid, &startq;I, being a
<HI>buck,</HI> had mi&s;s in to make tea.&endq;&mdash;He was rather
quie&s;cent to-night, and went early to bed. I
was in a cordial humour, and promoted a
cheerful gla&s;s. The punch was &s;uper-excellent.
Hone&s;t Mr. M'Queen ob&s;erved that I was in
high glee, &startq;my <HI>governour</HI> being gone to bed.&endq;
Yet in reality my heart was grieved, when I
<PB N="215" REF="221">
recollected that King&s;burgh was embarra&s;&s;ed in
his affairs, and intended to go to America.
However, nothing but what was good was
pre&s;ent, and I plea&s;ed my&s;elf in thinking that
&s;o &s;pirited a man would be well every where.
I &s;lept in the &s;ame room with Dr. John&s;on.

groupe of ideas as it is not ea&s;y for words to
de&s;cribe, as they pa&s;&s;ed through the mind. He
&s;miled, and &s;aid, &startq;I have had no ambitious
thoughts in it<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>This, perhaps, was &s;aid in allu&s;ion to &s;ome lines a&s;cribed to <HI>Pope,</HI> on his lying, at John Duke of Argyll's, at Adderbury, in the &s;ame bed in which Wilmot, Earl of Roche&s;ter, had &s;lept:</P>
<Q><L>&startq;With no poetick ardour fir'd,</L>
<L>I pre&s;s the bed where Wilmot lay;</L>
<L>That here he liv'd, or here expir'd,</L>
<L>Begets no numbers, grave or gay.&endq;</L></Q></NOTE>.&endq;&mdash;The room was decorated with
a great variety of maps and prints. Among
others, was Hogarth's print of Wilkes grinning,
with the cap of liberty on a pole by him.
That too was a curious circum&s;tance in the
&s;cene this morning; &s;uch a contra&s;t was
Wilkes to the above groupe. It reminded me
of Sir William Chambers's Account of Oriental
Gardening, in which we are told all odd,
&s;trange, ugly, and even terrible objects, are
introduced, for the &s;ake of variety: a wild ex|travagance
of ta&s;te which is &s;o well ridiculed
in the celebrated Epi&s;tle to him. The following
lines of that poem immediately occurred to me:</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Here, too, O king of vengeance! in thy fane,</L>
<L>Tremendous Wilkes &s;hall rattle his gold chain.&endq;</L></Q>
<P><PB N="217" REF="223">
Upon the table in our room I found in the
morning a &s;lip of paper, on which Dr. John|&s;on
had written with his pencil the&s;e words:</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Quantum cedat virtutibus aurum.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>What he meant by writing them I could not tell.
He had catched cold a day or two ago, and
the rain ye&s;terday having made it wor&s;e, he
was become very deaf. At breakfa&s;t he &s;aid,
he would have given a good deal, rather than
not have lain in that bed. I owned he was the
lucky man; and ob&s;erved, that without doubt
it had been contrived between Mrs. Macdonald
and him. She &s;eemed to acquie&s;ce; adding,
&startq;You know young <HI>bucks</HI> are always favourites
of the ladies.&endq; He &s;poke of Prince Charles
being here, and a&s;ked Mrs. Macdonald &startq;<HI>Who</HI>
was with him? We were told, madam, in Eng|land,
there was one Mi&s;s Flora Macdonald
with him.&endq;&mdash;She &s;aid, &startq;they were very
right;&endq; and perceiving Dr. John&s;on's curio&s;ity,
though he had delicacy enough not to que&s;tion
her, very obligingly entertained him with a
recital of the particulars which &s;he her&s;elf knew
of that e&s;cape, which does &s;o much honour to
the humanity, fidelity, and genero&s;ity, of the
Highlanders. Dr. John&s;on li&s;tened to her
with placid attention, and &s;aid, &startq;All this
&s;hould be written down.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="224">
From what &s;he told us, and from what I was
told by others per&s;onally concerned, and from
a paper of information which Ra&s;ay was &s;o
good as to &s;end me, at my de&s;ire, I have com|piled
the following ab&s;tract, which, as it con|tains
&s;ome curious anecdotes, will, I imagine
not be unintere&s;ting to my readers, and even,
perhaps, be of &s;ome u&s;e to future hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>Prince Charles Edward, after the battle of
Culloden, was conveyed to what is called the
<HI>Long I&s;land,</HI> where he lay for &s;ome time concealed.
But intelligence having been obtained where he
was, and a number of troops having come in
que&s;t of him, it became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
for him to quit that country without delay.
Mi&s;s Flora Macdonald, then a young lady,
animated by what &s;he thought the &s;acred prin|ciple
of loyalty, offered, with the magnanimity
of a Heroine, to accompany him in an open
boat to Sky, though the coa&s;t they were to quit
was guarded by &s;hips. He dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in
women's clothes, and pa&s;&s;ed as her &s;uppo&s;ed
maid by the name of Betty Bourke, an Iri&s;h
girl. They got off undi&s;covered, though
&s;everal &s;hots were fired to bring them to, and
landed at Mug&s;tot, the &s;eat of Sir Alexander
Macdonald. Sir Alexander was then at Fort
Augu&s;tus, with the Duke of Cumberland; but
his lady was at home. Prince Charles took his
po&s;t upon a hill near the hou&s;e. Flora Mac|donald
<PB N="219" REF="225">
waited on Lady Margaret, and ac|quainted
her of the enterpri&s;e in which &s;he was
engaged. Her lady&s;hip, who&s;e active benevo|lence
was ever &s;econded by &s;uperior talents,
&s;hewed a perfect pre&s;ence of mind, and readi|ne&s;s
of invention, and at once &s;ettled that
Prince Charles &s;hould be conducted to old
Ra&s;ay, who was him&s;elf concealed with &s;ome
&s;elect friends. The plan was in&s;tantly com|municated
to King&s;burgh, who was di&s;patched
to the hill to inform the Wanderer, and carry
him refre&s;hments. When King&s;burgh ap|proached,
he &s;tarted up, and advanced, hold|ing
a large knotted &s;tick, and in appearance
ready to knock him down, till he &s;aid, &startq;I am
Macdonald of King&s;burgh, come to &s;erve
your highne&s;s.&endq; The Wanderer an&s;wered,
&startq;It is well,&endq; and was &s;atisfied with the plan.</P>
<P>Flora Macdonald dined with Lady Margaret,
at who&s;e table there &s;at an officer of the army,
&s;tationed here with a party of &s;oldiers, to watch
for Prince Charles in ca&s;e of his flying to the
i&s;le of Sky. She afterwards often laughed in
good humour with this gentleman, on her
having &s;o well deceived him.</P>
<P>After dinner, Flora Macdonald on hor&s;e-back,
and her &s;uppo&s;ed maid and King&s;burgh,
with a &s;ervant carrying &s;ome linnen, all on
foot, proceeded towards that gentleman's
hou&s;e. Upon the road was a &s;mall rivulet
<PB N="220" REF="226">
which they were obliged to cro&s;s. The Wan|derer,
forgetting his a&s;&s;umed &s;ex, that his
clothes might not be wet, held them up a great
deal too high. King&s;burgh mentioned this
to him, ob&s;erving, it might make a di&s;covery.
He &s;aid, he would be more careful for the fu|ture.
He was as good as his word; for the
next brook they cro&s;&s;ed, he did not hold up his
clothes at all, but let them float upon the
water. He was very aukward in his female
dre&s;s. His &s;ize was &s;o large, and his &s;trides &s;o
great, that &s;ome women whom they met re|ported
that they had &s;een a very big woman,
who looked like a man in women's clothes,
and that perhaps it was (as they expre&s;&s;ed
them&s;elves) the <HI>Prince,</HI> after whom &s;o much
&s;earch was making.</P>
<P>At King&s;burgh he met with a mo&s;t cordial
reception; &s;eemed gay at &s;upper, and after it
indulged him&s;elf in a cheerful gla&s;s with his
worthy ho&s;t. As he had not had his clothes off
for a long time, the comfort of a good bed was
highly reli&s;hed by him, and he &s;lept &s;oundly
till next day at one o'clock.</P>
<P>The mi&s;tre&s;s of Corrichatachin told me, that
in the forenoon &s;he went into her father's room,
who was al&s;o in bed, and &s;ugge&s;ted to him her
apprehen&s;ions that a party of the military
might come up, and that his gue&s;t and he had
better not remain here too long. Her father
<PB N="221" REF="227">
&s;aid, &startq;Let the poor man repo&s;e him&s;elf after
his fatigues; and as for me, I care not, though
they take off this old grey head ten or eleven
years &s;ooner than I &s;hould die in the cour&s;e of
nature.&endq; He then wrapped him&s;elf in the bed|clothes,
and again fell fa&s;t a&s;leep.</P>
<P>On the afternoon of that day, the Wanderer,
&s;till in the &s;ame dre&s;s, &s;et out for Portree, with
Flora Macdonald and a man &s;ervant. His
&s;hoes being very bad, King&s;burgh provided him
with a new pair, and taking up the old ones,
&s;aid, &startq;I will faithfully keep them till you are
&s;afely &s;ettled at St. James's. I will then intro|duce
my&s;elf, by &s;haking them at you, to put
you in mind of your night's entertainment and
protection under my roof.&endq;&mdash;He &s;miled, and
&s;aid, &startq;Be as good as your word!&endq;&mdash;King&s;|burgh
kept the &s;hoes as long as he lived. After
his death, a zealous Jacobite gentleman gave
twenty guineas for them.</P>
<P>Old Mrs. Macdonald, after her gue&s;t had
left the hou&s;e, took the &s;heets in which he had
lain, folded them carefully, and charged her
daughter that they &s;hould be kept unwa&s;hed,
and that, when &s;he died, her body &s;hould be
wrapped in them as a winding &s;heet. Her
will was religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Upon the road to Portree, Prince Charles
changed his dre&s;s, and put on man's clothes
again; a tartan &s;hort coat and wai&s;tcoat, with
<PB N="222" REF="228">
philibeg and &s;hort ho&s;e, a plaid, and a wig
and bonnet.</P>
<P>Mr. Donald M^cDonald, called Donald Roy,
had been &s;ent expre&s;s to the pre&s;ent Ra&s;ay,
then the young laird, who was at that time at
his &s;i&s;ter's hou&s;e, about three miles from
Portree, attending his brother, Dr. Macleod,
who was recovering of a wound he had received
at the battle of Culloden. Mr. M^cDonald
communicated to young Ra&s;ay the plan of con|veying
the Wanderer to where old Ra&s;ay was;
but was told that old Ra&s;ay had fled to Knoi|dart,
a part of Glengary's e&s;tate. There was
then a dilemma what &s;hould be done. Donald
Roy propo&s;ed that he &s;hould conduct the Wan|derer
to the main land; but young Ra&s;ay
thought it too dangerous at that time, and &s;aid
it would be better to conceal him in the i&s;land
of Ra&s;ay, till old Ra&s;ay could be informed
where he was, and give his advice what was
be&s;t. But the difficulty was, how to get him
to Ra&s;ay. They could not tru&s;t a Portree
crew, and all the Ra&s;ay boats had been de|&s;troyed,
or carried off by the military, except
two belonging to Malcolm M'Leod, which he
had concealed &s;omewhere.</P>
<P>Dr. M'Leod being informed of this diffi|culty,
&s;aid he would ri&s;k his life once more for
Prince Charles; and it having occurred, that
there was a little boat upon a fre&s;h-water lake
<PB N="223" REF="229">
in the neighbourhood, the two brothers, with
the help of &s;ome women, brought it to
the &s;ea, by extraordinary exertion, acro&s;s a
Highland mile of land, one half of which was
bog, and the other a &s;teep precipice.</P>
<P>The&s;e gallant brothers, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
one little boy, rowed the &s;mall boat to Ra&s;ay,
where they were to endeavour to find Captain
Macleod, as Malcolm was then called, and
get one of his good boats, with which they
might return to Portree, and receive the Wan|derer;
or, in ca&s;e of not finding him, they
were to make the &s;mall boat &s;erve, though the
danger was con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Fortunately, on their fir&s;t landing, they
found their cou&s;in Malcolm, who, with the
utmo&s;t alacrity, got ready one of his boats,
with two &s;turdy men, John M'Kenzie, and
Donald M'Friar. Malcolm, being the olde&s;t
man, and mo&s;t cautious, &s;aid, that as young
Ra&s;ay had not hitherto appeared in the unfor|tunate
bu&s;ine&s;s, he ought not to run any ri&s;k;
but that Dr. M'Leod and him&s;elf, who were
already publickly engaged, &s;hould go on this
expedition. Young Ra&s;ay an&s;wered, with an
oath, that he would go, at the ri&s;k of his life
and fortune.&mdash;&startq;In GOD's name then (&s;aid
Malcolm) let us proceed.&endq; The two boatmen,
however, now &s;topped &s;hort, till they &s;hould
be informed of their de&s;tination; and M'Kenzie
<PB N="224" REF="230">
declared he would not move an oar till he knew
where they were going. Upon which they
were both &s;worn to &s;ecre&s;y; and the bu&s;ine&s;s
being imparted to them, they were keen for
putting off to &s;ea without lo&s;s of time. The
boat &s;oon landed about half a mile from the
inn at Portree.</P>
<P>All this was negotiated before the Wanderer
got forward to Portree. Malcolm M'Leod, and
M'Friar, were di&s;patched to look for him. In
a &s;hort time he appeared, and went into the
publick hou&s;e. There Donald Roy, whom he
had &s;een at Mug&s;tot, received him, and in|formed
him of what had been concerted. Here
he wanted &s;ilver for a guinea. The landlord
had but thirteen &s;hillings. He was going to
accept of this for his guinea; but Donald Roy
very judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erved, that it would di&s;|cover
him to be &s;ome great man; &s;o he de|&s;i&s;ted.
He &s;lipped out of the hou&s;e, leaving
his fair protectre&s;s, whom he never again &s;aw;
and Malcolm M'Leod was pre&s;ented to him by
Donald Roy, as a captain in his army. Young
Ra&s;ay and Dr. M'Leod had waited, in impa|tient
anxiety, in the boat. When he came,
their names were announced to him. He
would not permit the u&s;ual ceremonies of re|&s;pect,
but &s;aluted them as his equals.</P>
<P>Donald Roy &s;taid in Sky, to be in readine&s;s
to get intelligence, and give an alarm in ca&s;e
<PB N="225" REF="231">
the troops &s;hould di&s;cover the retreat to Ra&s;ay;
and Prince Charles was then conveyed in a
boat to that i&s;land in the night. He &s;lept a
little upon the pa&s;&s;age, and they landed about
day-break. There was &s;ome difficulty in ac|commodating
him with a lodging, as almo&s;t
all the hou&s;es in the i&s;land had been burnt by
the &s;oldiery. They repaired to a little hut,
which &s;ome &s;hepherds had lately built, and
having prepared it as well as they could, and
made a bed of heath for the &s;tranger, they
kindled a fire, and partook of &s;ome provi&s;ions
which had been &s;ent with him from King&s;burgh.
It was ob&s;erved, that he would not ta&s;te wheat|bread,
or brandy, while oat-bread and whi&s;ky
la&s;ted; &startq;for the&s;e, &s;aid he, are my own
country bread and drink.&endq;&mdash;This was very
engaging to the Highlanders.</P>
<P>Young Ra&s;ay being the only per&s;on of the
company that dur&s;t appear with &s;afety, he went
in que&s;t of &s;omething fre&s;h for them to eat;
but though he was amid&s;t his own cows,
&s;heep, and goats, he could not venture to take
any of them for fear of a di&s;covery, but was
obliged to &s;upply him&s;elf by &s;tealth. He
therefore catched a kid, and brought it to the
hut in his plaid, and it was killed and dre&s;t,
and furni&s;hed them a meal which they reli&s;hed
much. The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Wanderer, who&s;e health
was now a good deal impaired by hunger, fa|tigue,
<PB N="226" REF="232">
and watching, &s;lept a long time, but
&s;eemed to be frequently di&s;turbed. Malcolm
told me he would &s;tart from broken &s;lumbers,
and &s;peak to him&s;elf in different languages,
French, Italian, and Engli&s;h. I mu&s;t how|ever
acknowledge, that it is highly probable
that my worthy friend Malcolm did not know
preci&s;ely the difference between French and
Italian. One of his expre&s;&s;ions in Engli&s;h was,
&startq;O GOD! poor Scotland!&endq;</P>
<P>While they were in the hut, M'Kenzie and
M'Friar, the two boatmen, were placed as
&s;entinels upon different eminences; and one
day an incident happened, which mu&s;t not be
omitted. There was a man wandering about
the i&s;land, &s;elling tobacco. Nobody knew
him, and he was &s;u&s;pected to be a &s;py. Mac|kenzie
came running to the hut, and told that
this &s;u&s;pected per&s;on was approaching. Upon
which the three gentlemen, young Ra&s;ay, Dr.
M'Leod, and Malcolm, held a council of war
upon him, and were unanimou&s;ly of opinion
that he &s;hould be in&s;tantly put to death. Prince
Charles, at once a&s;&s;uming a grave and even
&s;evere countenance, &s;aid, &startq;GOD forbid that
we &s;hould take away a man's life, who may be
innocent, while we can pre&s;erve our own.&endq;
The gentlemen however per&s;i&s;ted in their re&s;o|lution,
while he as &s;trenuou&s;ly continued to
take the merciful &s;ide. John M'Kenzie, who
<PB N="227" REF="233">
&s;at watching at the door of the hut, and over|heard
the debate, &s;aid in Er&s;e, &startq;Well, well;
he mu&s;t be &s;hot. You are the king, but we
are the parliament, and will do what we
choo&s;e.&endq;&mdash;Prince Charles, &s;eeing the gen|tlemen
&s;mile, a&s;ked what the man had &s;aid,
and being told it in Engli&s;h, he ob&s;erved that
he was a clever fellow, and, notwith&s;tanding
the perilous &s;ituation in which he was, laughed
loud and heartily. Luckily the unknown per|&s;on
did not perceive that there were people in
the hut, at lea&s;t did not come to it, but walked
on pa&s;t it, unknowing of his ri&s;k. It was after|wards
found out that he was one of the High|land
army, who was him&s;elf in danger. Had
he come to them, they were re&s;olved to di&s;|patch
him; for, as Malcolm &s;aid to me, &startq;We
could not keep him with us, and we dur&s;t not
let him go. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, I would have
&s;hot my brother, if I had not been &s;ure of
him.&endq;&mdash;John M'Kenzie is alive. I &s;aw him at
Ra&s;ay's hou&s;e. About eighteen years ago, he
hurt one of his legs when dancing, and being
obliged to have it cut off, he now was going
about with a wooden leg. The &s;tory of his
being a <HI>member of parliament</HI> is not yet forgotten$
I took him out a little way from the hou&s;e,
gave him a &s;hilling to drink Ra&s;ay's health,
and led him into a detail of the particulars
which I have ju&s;t related.&mdash;With le&s;s founda|tion,
<PB N="228" REF="234">
&s;ome writers have traced the idea of $word$
parliament, and of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, in
rude and early times. I was curious to know
if he had really heard, or under&s;tood, any
thing of that &s;ubject, which, had he been a
greater man, would probably have been eagerly
maintained. &startq;Why, John, &s;aid I, did you
think the king &s;hould be controuled by a par|liament?&endq;
&mdash;He an&s;wered, &startq;I thought, Sir,
there were many voices again&s;t one.&endq;</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation then turning on the times,
the Wanderer &s;aid, that, to be &s;ure, the life he
had led of late was a very hard one; but he
would rather live in the way he now did, for
ten years, than fall into the hands of his ene|mies.
The gentlemen a&s;ked him, what he
thought his enemies would do with him, &s;hould
he have the mi&s;fortune to fall into their hands.
He &s;aid, he did not believe they would dare to
take his life publickly, but he dreaded being
privately de&s;troyed by poi&s;on or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination.&mdash;
He was very particular in his inquiries about
the wound which Dr. M'Leod had received at
the battle of Culloden, from a ball, which en|tered
at one &s;houlder, and went cro&s;s to the
other. The doctor happened &s;till to have on
the coat which he wore on that occa&s;ion. He
mentioned, that he him&s;elf had his hor&s;e &s;hot
under him at Culloden; that the ball hit the
hor&s;e about two inches from his knee, and
<PB N="229" REF="235">
made him &s;o unruly that he was obliged to
change him for another. He threw out &s;ome
reflections on the conduct of the di&s;a&s;trous af|fair
at Culloden, &s;aying, however, that perhaps
it was ra&s;h in him to do &s;o.&mdash;I am now con|vinced
that his &s;u&s;picions were groundle&s;s;
for I have had a good deal of conver&s;ation
upon the &s;ubject with my very worthy and in|genious
friend, Mr. Andrew Lumi&s;den, who
was under &s;ecretary to Prince Charles, and
afterwards principal &s;ecretary to his father at
Rome, who, he a&s;&s;ured me, was perfectly &s;ati&s;|fied
both of the abilities and honour of the
generals who commanded the Highland army
on that occa&s;ion. Mr. Lumi&s;den has written an
account of the three battles in 1745-6, at once
accurate and cla&s;&s;ical.&mdash;Talking of the different
Highland corps, the gentlemen who were pre|&s;ent
wi&s;hed to have his opinion which were the
be&s;t &s;oldiers. He &s;aid, he did not like compa|ri&s;ons
among tho&s;e corps: they were all be&s;t.</P>
<P>He told his conductors, he did not think it
advi&s;eable to remain long in any one place;
and that he expected a French &s;hip to come for
him to Lochbroom, among the Mackenzies.
It then was propo&s;ed to carry him in one of
Malcolm's boats to Lochbroom, though the
di&s;tance was fifteen leagues coa&s;twi&s;e. But he
thought this would be too dangerous, and
<PB N="230" REF="236">
de&s;ired that at any rate they might fir&s;t endeavour
to obtain intelligence. Upon which young
Ra&s;ay wrote to his friend, Mr. M'Kenzie of
Applecro&s;s, but received an an&s;wer, that there
was no appearance of any French &s;hip.</P>
<P>It was therefore re&s;olved that they &s;hould
return to Sky, which they did, and landed in
Strath, where they repo&s;ed in a cow-hou&s;e be|longing
to Mr. Niccol&s;on of Scorbreck. The
&s;ea was very rough, and the boat took in a
good deal of water. The Wanderer a&s;ked if
there was danger, as he was not u&s;ed to &s;uch a
ve&s;&s;el. Upon being told there was not, he
&s;ung an Er&s;e &s;ong with much vivacity. He
had by this time acquired a good deal of the
Er&s;e language</P>
<P>Young Ra&s;ay was now di&s;patched to where
Donald Roy was, that they might get all the
intelligence they could; and the Wanderer,
with much earne&s;tne&s;s, charged Dr. M'Leod to
have a boat ready, at a certain place about
&s;even miles off, as he &s;aid he intended it &s;hould
carry him upon a matter of great con&s;equence;
and gave the doctor a ca&s;e, containing a &s;ilver
&s;poon, knife, and fork, &s;aying, &startq;keep you that
till I &s;ee you,&endq; which the doctor under&s;tood to
be two days from that time. But all the&s;e or|ders
were only blinds; for he had another plan
in his head, but wi&s;ely thought it &s;afe&s;t to tru&s;t
his &s;ecrets to no more per&s;ons than was ab&s;o|lutely
<PB N="231" REF="237">
nece&s;&s;ary. Having then de&s;ired Malcolm
to walk with him a little way from the hou&s;e,
he &s;oon opened his mind, &s;aying, &startq;I deliver
my&s;elf to you. Conduct me to the Laird of
M'Kinnon's country.&endq;&mdash;Malcolm objected
that it was very dangerous, as &s;o many parties
of &s;oldiers were in motion. He an&s;wered,
&startq;There is nothing now to be done without
danger.&endq;&mdash;He then &s;aid, that Malcolm mu&s;t
be the ma&s;ter, and he the &s;ervant; &s;o he took
the bag, in which his linen was put up, and
carried it on his &s;houlder; and ob&s;erving that
his wai&s;tcoat, which was of &s;carlet tartan, with
a gold twi&s;t button, was finer than Malcolm's,
which was of a plain ordinary tartan, he put on
Malcolm's wai&s;tcoat, and gave him his; re|marking
at the &s;ame time, that it did not look
well that the &s;ervant &s;hould be better dre&s;&s;ed
than the ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Malcolm, though an excellent walker, found
him&s;elf excelled by Prince Charles, who told
him, he &s;hould not much mind the parties that
were looking for him, were he once but a mu&s;|ket-&s;hot
from them; but that he was &s;omewhat
afraid of the Highlanders who were again&s;t him.
He was well u&s;ed to walking in Italy in pur&s;uit
of game; and he was even now &s;o keen a
&s;port&s;man, that, having ob&s;erved &s;ome par|tridges,
he was going to take a &s;hot; but Mal|colm
cautioned him again&s;t it, ob&s;erving that
<PB N="232" REF="238">
the firing might be heard by the tenders who
were hovering upon the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>As they proceeded through the mountains,
taking many a circuit to avoid any hou&s;es,
Malcolm, to try his re&s;olution, a&s;ked him what
they &s;hould do, &s;hould they fall in with a party
of &s;oldiers? He an&s;wered, &startq;Fight, to be &s;ure!&endq;
&mdash;Having a&s;ked Malcolm if he &s;hould be
known in his pre&s;ent dre&s;s, and Malcolm having
replied he would, he &s;aid, &startq;Then I'll blacken
my face with powder.&endq;&mdash;&startq;That, &s;aid Malcolm,
would di&s;cover you at once.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Then, &s;aid
he, I mu&s;t be put in the greate&s;t de&s;habille po&s;|&s;ible.&endq;
So he pulled off his wig, tied a hand|kerchief
round his head, and put his night-cap
over it, tore the ruffles from his &s;hirt, took the
buckles out of his &s;hoes, and made Malcolm
fa&s;ten them with &s;trings; but &s;till Malcolm
thought he would be known. &startq;I have &s;o odd
a face, &s;aid he, that no man ever &s;aw me but
he would know me again.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;eemed unwilling to give credit to the
horrid narrative of men being ma&s;&s;acred in
cold blood, after victory had declared for the
army commanded by the Duke of Cumberland.
He could not allow him&s;elf to think that a
general could be &s;o barbarous.</P>
<P>When they came within two miles of M'Kin|non's
hou&s;e, Malcolm a&s;ked if he cho&s;e to &s;ee
the laird. &startq;No, &s;aid he, by no means. I
<PB N="233" REF="239">
know M'Kinnon to be as good and as hone&s;t
a man as any in the world, but he is not fit
for my purpo&s;e at pre&s;ent. You mu&s;t conduct
me to &s;ome other hou&s;e; but let it be a gen|tleman's
hou&s;e.&endq;&mdash;Malcolm then determined
that they &s;hould go to the hou&s;e of his brother-in-law,
Mr. John M'Kinnon, and from thence
be conveyed to the main land of Scotland, and
claim the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Macdonald of Scothou&s;e.
The Wanderer at fir&s;t objected to this, becau&s;e
Scothou&s;e was cou&s;in to a per&s;on of whom he
had &s;u&s;picions. But he acquie&s;ced in Mal|colm's
opinion.</P>
<P>When they were near Mr. John M'Kinnon's
hou&s;e, they met a man of the name of Ro&s;s,
who had been a private &s;oldier in the Highland
army. He fixed his eyes &s;teadily on the Wan|derer
in his di&s;gui&s;e, and having at once re|cognized
him, he clapped his hands, and ex|claimed,
&startq;Alas! is this the ca&s;e?&endq; Finding
that there was now a di&s;covery, Malcolm
a&s;ked, &startq;What's to be done?&endq; &startq;Swear him
to &s;ecre&s;y,&endq; an&s;wered Prince Charles. Upon
which Malcolm drew his durk, and on the
naked blade made him take a &s;olemn oath,
that he would &s;ay nothing of his having &s;een
the Wanderer, till his e&s;cape &s;hould be made
publick.</P>
<P>Malcolm's &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e hou&s;e they reached
pretty early in the morning, a&s;ked him who
<PB N="234" REF="240">
the per&s;on was that was along with him. He
&s;aid, it was one Lewis Caw, from Crieff, who
being a fugitive like him&s;elf for the &s;ame rea|&s;on,
he had engaged him as his &s;ervant, but
that he had fallen &s;ick. &startq;Poor man! &s;aid &s;he,
I pity him. At the &s;ame time my heart warms
to a man of his appearance.&endq;&mdash;Her hu&s;band
was gone a little way from home; but was ex|pected
every minute to return. She &s;et down
to her brother a plentiful Highland breakfa&s;t.
Prince Charles acted the &s;ervant very well,
&s;itting at a re&s;pectful di&s;tance, with his bonnet
off. Malcolm then &s;aid to him, &startq;Mr. Caw,
you have as much need of this as I have;
there is enough for us both: you had better
draw nearer and &s;hare with me.&endq;&mdash;Upon which
he ro&s;e, made a profound bow, &s;at down at
table with his &s;uppo&s;ed ma&s;ter, and eat very
heartily. After this there came in an old wo|man,
who, after the mode of ancient ho&s;pita|lity,
brought warm water, and wa&s;hed Mal|colm's
feet. He de&s;ired her to wa&s;h the feet
of the poor man who attended him. She at
fir&s;t &s;eemed aver&s;e to this, from pride, as
thinking him beneath her, and in the peri|phra&s;tick
language of the Highlanders and the
Iri&s;h, &s;aid warmly, &startq;Though I wa&s;h your
father's &s;on's feet, why &s;hould I wa&s;h his father's
&s;on's feet?&endq;&mdash;She was however per&s;uaded to
do it.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="241">
They then went to bed, and &s;lept for &s;ome
time; and when Malcolm awaked, he was told
that Mr. John M'Kinnon, his brother-in-law,
was in &s;ight. He &s;prang out to talk to him
before he &s;hould &s;ee Prince Charles. After
&s;aluting him, Malcolm, pointing to the &s;ea,
&s;aid, &startq;What, John, if the prince &s;hould be
pri&s;oner on board one of tho&s;e tenders?&endq;&mdash;
&startq;GOD forbid!&endq; replied John.&mdash;&startq;What if we
had him here?&endq; &s;aid Malcolm.&mdash;&startq;I wi&s;h we
had, an&s;wered John; we &s;hould take care of
him.&endq;&mdash;Well, John, &s;aid Malcolm, he is in
your hou&s;e.&endq;&mdash;John, in a tran&s;port of joy,
wanted to run directly in, and pay his obei&s;ance;
but Malcolm &s;topped him, &s;aying, &startq;Now is
your time to behave well, and do nothing that
can di&s;cover him.&endq;&mdash;John compo&s;ed him&s;elf,
and having &s;ent away all his &s;ervants upon dif|ferent
errands, he was introduced into the pre|&s;ence
of his gue&s;t, and was then de&s;ired to go
and get ready a boat lying near his hou&s;e,
which, though but a &s;mall leaky one, they re|&s;olved
to take, rather than go to the Laird of
M'Kinnon. John M'Kinnon however thought
otherwi&s;e; and upon his return told them,
that his Chief and Lady M'Kinnon were com|ing
in the laird's boat. Prince Charles &s;aid to
his tru&s;ty Malcolm, &startq;I am &s;orry for this, but
mu&s;t make the be&s;t of it.&endq;&mdash;M'Kinnon then
walked up from the &s;hore, and did homage to
<PB N="236" REF="242">
the Wanderer. His lady waited in a cave, to
which they all repaired, and were entertained
with cold meat and wine.&mdash;Mr. Malcolm
M'Leod being now &s;uper&s;eded by the Laird of
M'Kinnon, de&s;ired leave to return, which was
granted him, and Prince Charles wrote a &s;hort
note, which he &s;ub&s;cribed <HI>James Thomp&s;on,</HI> in|forming
his friends that he had got away from
Sky, and thanking them for their kindne&s;s;
and he de&s;ired this might be &s;peedily conveyed
to young Ra&s;ay and Dr. M'Leod, that they
might not wait longer in expectation of &s;eeing
him again. He bid a cordial adieu to Mal|colm,
and in&s;i&s;ted on his accepting of a &s;ilver
&s;tock-buckle, and ten guineas from his pur&s;e,
though, as Malcolm told me, it did not appear
to contain above forty. Malcolm at fir&s;t begged
to be excu&s;ed, &s;aying, that he had a few gui|neas
at his &s;ervice; but Prince Charles an&s;wered,
&startq;You will have need of money. I &s;hall get
enough when I come upon the main land.&endq;</P>
<P>The Laird of M'Kinnon then conveyed him
to the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Knoidart. Old Ra&s;ay,
to whom intelligence had been &s;ent, was cro&s;|&s;ing
at the &s;ame time to Sky; but as they did
not know of each other, and each had appre|hen&s;ions,
the two boats kept aloof.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the particulars which I have col|lected
concerning the extraordinary conceal|ment
and e&s;capes of Prince Charles, in the
<PB N="237" REF="243">
Hebrides. He was often in imminent danger.
The troops traced him from the Long I&s;land,
acro&s;s Sky, to Portree, but there lo&s;t him.</P>
<P>Here I &s;top,&mdash;having received no farther
authentick information of his fatigues and perils
before he e&s;caped to France.&mdash;Kings and &s;ub|jects
may both take a le&s;&s;on of moderation from
the melancholy fate of the Hou&s;e of Stuart;
that the former may not &s;uffer degradation and
exile, and the latter may not be harra&s;&s;ed by
the evils of a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Let me clo&s;e the &s;cene on that unfortunate

<P>In another place he thus &s;ums up the
&s;ad &s;tory of the family in general:&mdash;&startq;Il n'y

<P>The gallant Malcolm was apprehended in
about ten days after they &s;eparated, put aboard
a &s;hip, and carried pri&s;oner to London. He
&s;aid, the pri&s;oners in general were very ill
treated in their pa&s;&s;age; but there were &s;oldiers
on board who lived well, and &s;ometimes invited
him to &s;hare with them: that he had the good
fortune not to be thrown into jail, but was
<PB N="239" REF="245">
confined in the hou&s;e of a me&s;&s;enger, of the
name of Dick. To his a&s;toni&s;hment, only one
witne&s;s could be found again&s;t him, though he
had been &s;o openly engaged; and therefore,
for want of &s;ufficient evidence, he was &s;et at
liberty. He added, that he thought him&s;elf in
&s;uch danger, that he would gladly have com|pounded
for bani&s;hment. Yet, he &s;aid, &startq;he
&s;hould never be &s;o ready for death as he then
was.&endq;&mdash;There is philo&s;ophical truth in this. A
man will meet death much more firmly at one
time than another. The enthu&s;ia&s;m even of a
mi&s;taken principle warms the mind, and &s;ets it
above the fear of death; which in our cooler
moments, if we really think of it, cannot but be
terrible, or at lea&s;t very awful.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Flora Macdonald being then al&s;o in
London, under the protection of Lady Prim|ro&s;e,
that lady provided a po&s;t-chai&s;e to convey
her to Scotland, and de&s;ired &s;he might choo&s;e
any friend &s;he plea&s;ed to accompany her. She
cho&s;e Malcolm. &startq;So (&s;aid he, with a trium|phant

<P>Mr. M'Leod of Muiraven&s;ide, whom we
&s;aw at Ra&s;ay, a&s;&s;ured us that Prince Charles
was in London in 1759, and that there was
then a plan in agitation for re&s;toring his family.
Dr. John&s;on could &s;carcely credit this &s;tory,
<PB N="240" REF="246">
and &s;aid, &startq;There could be no probable plan
at that time. Such an attempt could not have
&s;ucceeded, unle&s;s the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had
&s;topped the army in Germany; for both the
army and the Fleet would, even without or|ders,
have fought for the King, to whom they
had engaged them&s;elves.&endq;</P>
<P>Having related &s;o many particulars concern|ing
the grand&s;on of the unfortunate King
James the Second; having given due prai&s;e to

for the heart; I mu&s;t do the High|landers
the ju&s;tice to atte&s;t, that I found every

<P>The ab&s;tract point of <HI>right</HI> would involve us
in a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of remote and perplexed que&s;|tions;
and after all, we &s;hould have no clear

which, from political nece&s;&s;ity, took place in
1688, by a breach in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our
kings; and which, whatever benefits may
have accrued from it, certainly gave a &s;hock

the inhabitants of the Highlands and the He|brides.
The plant of loyalty is there in full
vigour, and the Brun&s;wick graft now flouri&s;hes

<P>King&s;burgh conducted us in his boat, acro&s;s
one of the lochs, as they call them, or arms of
the &s;ea, which flow in upon all the coa&s;ts of
Sky,&mdash;to a mile beyond a place called <HI>Gri&s;hini&s;h.</HI>
Our hor&s;es had been &s;ent round by land to
meet us. By this &s;ail we &s;aved eight miles of
bad riding. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;When we
take into the computation what we have &s;aved,
and what we have gained, by this agreeable
&s;ail, it is a great deal.&endq; He ob&s;erved, &startq;it is
very di&s;agreeable riding in Sky. The way is
&s;o narrow, one only at a time can travel, &s;o it
is quite un&s;ocial; and you cannot indulge in
meditation by your&s;elf, becau&s;e you mu&s;t be
always attending to the &s;teps which your hor&s;e
<PB N="245" REF="251">
takes.&endq;&mdash;This was a ju&s;t and clear de&s;cription
of its inconveniences.</P>
<P>The topick of emigration being again intro|duced,
Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, that &startq;a rapacious Chief
would make a wilderne&s;s of his e&s;tate.&endq; Mr.
Donald M'Queen told us, that the oppre&s;&s;ion,
which then made &s;o much noi&s;e, was owing to
landlords li&s;tening to bad advice in the letting of
their lands; that intere&s;ted and de&s;igning
people flattered them with golden dreams of
much higher rents than could rea&s;onably be
paid; and that &s;ome of the gentlemen <HI>tack&s;|men,</HI>
or upper tenants, were them&s;elves in part
the occa&s;ion of the mi&s;chief, by over-rating the
farms of others. That many of the <HI>tack&s;men,</HI>
rather than comply with exorbitant demands,
had gone off to America, and impoveri&s;hed
the country, by draining it of its wealth; and
that their places were filled by a number of poor
people, who had lived under them, properly
&s;peaking, as &s;ervants, paid by a certain pro|portion
of the produce of the lands, though
called &s;ub-tenants. I ob&s;erved, that if the
men of &s;ub&s;tance were once bani&s;hed from a
Highland e&s;tate, it might probably be greatly
reduced in its value; for one bad year might
ruin a &s;et of poor tenants, and men of any
property would not &s;ettle in &s;uch a country,
unle&s;s from the temptation of getting land ex|tremely
cheap; for an inhabitant of any good
<PB N="246" REF="252">
county in Britain had better go to America
than to the Highlands or the Hebrides. Here
therefore was a con&s;ideration that ought to in|duce
a Chief to act a more liberal part, from a
mere motive of intere&s;t, independent of the
lofty and honourable principle of keeping a
clan together, to be in readine&s;s to &s;erve his
king. I added, that I could not help thinking
a little arbitrary power in the &s;overeign to con|troul
the bad policy and greedine&s;s of the Chiefs,
might &s;ometimes be of &s;ervice. In France a
Chief would not be permitted to force a number
of the king's &s;ubjects out of the country.&mdash;Dr.
John&s;on concurred with me, ob&s;erving, that
&startq;were an oppre&s;&s;ive chieftain a &s;ubject of the
French king, he would probably be admo|ni&s;hed
by a <HI>letter.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>During our &s;ail, Dr. John&s;on a&s;ked about
the u&s;e of the durk, with which he imagined
the Highlanders cut their meat. He was told,
they had a knife and fork be&s;ides, to eat with.
He a&s;ked, how did the women do? and was
an&s;wered, &s;ome of them had a knife and fork
too; but in general the men, when they had
cut their meat, handed their knives and forks
to the women, and they them&s;elves eat with
their fingers. The old tutor of Macdonald
always eat fi&s;h with his fingers, alledging that
a knife and fork gave it a bad ta&s;te. I took
the liberty to ob&s;erve to Dr. John&s;on, that he
<PB N="247" REF="253">
did &s;o. &startq;Yes, &s;aid he; but it is, becau&s;e I
am &s;hort-&s;ighted, and afraid of bones, for
which rea&s;on I am not fond of eating many
kinds of fi&s;h, becau&s;e I mu&s;t u&s;e my fingers.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Pher&s;on's <HI>Di&s;&s;ertations on Scotti&s;h Antiquities,</HI>
which he had looked at when at Corrichatachin,
being mentioned, he remarked, that &startq;you
might read half an hour, and a&s;k your&s;elf what
you had been reading: there were &s;o many
words to &s;o little matter, that there was no
getting through the book.&endq;</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we reached the &s;hore, we took
leave of King&s;burgh, and mounted our hor&s;es.
We pa&s;&s;ed through a wild moor, in many
places &s;o wet that we were obliged to walk,
which was very fatiguing to Dr. John&s;on.
Once he had advanced on hor&s;eback to a very
bad &s;tep. There was a &s;teep declivity on his
left, to which he was &s;o near, that there was
not room for him to di&s;mount in the u&s;ual way.
He tried to alight on the other &s;ide, as if he had
been a <HI>young buck</HI> indeed, but in the attempt he
fell at his length upon the ground; from which,
however, he got up immediately without being
hurt. During this dreary ride, we were &s;ome|times
relieved by a view of branches of the &s;ea,
that univer&s;al medium of connection among&s;t
mankind. A guide, who had been &s;ent with us
from King&s;burgh, explored the way (much in
the &s;ame manner as, I &s;uppo&s;e, is pur&s;ued in
<PB N="248" REF="254">
the wilds of America) by ob&s;erving certain
marks known only to the inhabitants. We
arrived at Dunvegan late in the afternoon.
The great &s;ize of the ca&s;tle, which is partly old
and partly new, and is built upon a rock clo&s;e
to the &s;ea, while the land around it pre&s;ents
nothing but wild, moori&s;h, hilly and craggy
appearances, gave a rude magnificence to the
&s;cene. Having di&s;mounted, we a&s;cended a
flight of &s;teps which was made by the late
M'Leod, for the accommodation of per&s;ons
coming to him by land, there formerly being,
for &s;ecurity, no other acce&s;s to the ca&s;tle but
from the &s;ea; &s;o that vi&s;itors who came by the
land were under the acce&s;&s;ity of getting into a
boat, and &s;ailed round to the only place where
it could be approached. We were introduced
into a &s;tately dining-room, and received by
Lady M'Leod, mother of the laird, who, with
his friend Tali&s;ker, having been detained on
the road, did not arrive till &s;ome time after us.</P>
<P>We found the lady of the hou&s;e a very polite
and &s;en&s;ible woman, who had lived for &s;ome
time in London, and had there been in Dr.
John&s;on's company. After we had dined, we
repaired to the drawing-room, where &s;ome of
the young ladies of the family, with their mo|ther,
were at tea. This room had formerly
been the bed-chamber of Sir Roderick M'Leod,
one of the old lairds; and he cho&s;e it, becau&s;e,
<PB N="249" REF="255">
behind it, there was a con&s;iderable ca&s;cade,
the &s;ound of which di&s;po&s;ed him to &s;leep.
Above his bed was this in&s;cription: &startq;Sir
Rorie M'Leod of Dunvegan, Knight. GOD
&s;end good re&s;t!&endq; Rorie is the contraction of
Roderick. He was called Rorie <HI>More,</HI> that is,
great Rorie, not from his &s;ize, but from his
&s;pirit.&mdash;Our entertainment here was in &s;o ele|gant
a &s;tyle, and reminded my fellow-traveller
&s;o much of England, that he became quite
joyous. He laughed, and &s;aid, &startq;Bo&s;well,
we came in at the wrong end of this i&s;land.&endq;
&mdash;&startq;Sir, &s;aid I, it was be&s;t to keep this for the
la&s;t.&endq;&mdash;He an&s;wered, &startq;I would have it both
fir&s;t and la&s;t.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>Tue&s;day, <DATE>14th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Dr. John&s;on &s;aid in the morning, &startq;Is not
this a fine lady?&endq;&mdash;There was not a word now
of his &startq;impatience to be in civilized life;&endq;&mdash;
though indeed I &s;hould beg pardon,&mdash;he found
it here. We had &s;lept well, and lain long.
After breakfa&s;t we &s;urveyed the ca&s;tle, and the
garden.&mdash;Mr. Bethune, the pari&s;h mini&s;ter,&mdash;
Magnus M'Leod of Claggan, brother to
Tali&s;ker, and M'Leod of Bay, two &s;ub&s;tantial
gentlemen of the clan, dined with us. We
had admirable veni&s;on, generous wine; in a
word, all that a good table has. This was
really the hall of a chief. Lady M'Leod had
<PB N="250" REF="256">
been much obliged to my father, who had
&s;ettled by arbitration a variety of perplexed
claims between her and her relation, the Laird
of Brodie, which &s;he now repaid by particular
attention to me.&mdash;M'Leod &s;tarted the &s;ubject
of making women do penance in the church
for fornication.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;It is right, &s;ir.
Infamy is attached to the crime, by univer&s;al
opinion, as &s;oon as it is known. I would not
be the man who would di&s;cover it, if I alone
knew it, for a woman may reform; nor would I
commend a par&s;on who divulges a woman's fir&s;t
offence; but being once divulged, it ought to
be infamous. Con&s;ider, of what importance to
&s;ociety the cha&s;tity of women is. Upon that
all the property in the world depends. We
hang a thief for &s;tealing a &s;heep; but the un|cha&s;tity
of a woman transfers &s;heep, and farm
and all, from the right owner. I have much
more reverence for a common pro&s;titute than
for a woman who conceals her guilt. The
pro&s;titute is known. She cannot deceive. She
cannot bring a &s;trumpet into the arms of an
hone&s;t man, without his knowledge.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI>
&startq;There is, however, a great difference be|tween
the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of a &s;ingle woman,
and that of a married woman.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Yes, &s;ir; there is a great difference between
&s;tealing a &s;hilling, and &s;tealing a thou&s;and
pounds; between &s;imply taking a man's pur&s;e,
<PB N="251" REF="257">
and murdering him fir&s;t, and then taking it.
But when one begins to be vicious, it is ea&s;y to
go on. Where &s;ingle women are licentious,
you rarely find faithful married women.&endq;&mdash;
<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;And yet we are told that in &s;ome
nations in India, the di&s;tinction is &s;trictly ob|&s;erved.&endq;
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Nay, don't give us India.
That puts me in mind of Monte&s;quieu, who is
really a fellow of genius too in many re&s;pects;
whenever he wants to &s;upport a &s;trange opinion,
he quotes you the practice of Japan or of &s;ome
other di&s;tant country, of which he knows no|thing.
To &s;upport polygamy, he tells you of
the i&s;land of Formo&s;a, where there are ten
women born for one man. He had but to
&s;uppo&s;e another i&s;land, where there are ten men
born for one woman, and &s;o make a marriage
between them<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">What my friend treated as &s;o wild a &s;uppo&s;ition, has ac|tually happened in the We&s;tern I&s;lands of Scotland, if we may believe Martin, who tells it of the i&s;lands of Col and Tyr-yi, and that it is proved by the pari&s;h regi&s;ters.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>At &s;upper, Lady M'Leod mentioned Dr.
Cadogan's book on the gout.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;It
is a good book in general, but a fooli&s;h one in
particulars. It is good in general, as recom|mending
temperance and exerci&s;e, and cheer|fulne&s;s.
In that re&s;pect it is only Dr. Cheyne's
book told in a new way; and there &s;hould
come out &s;uch a book every thirty years,
<PB N="252" REF="258">
dre&s;&s;ed in the mode of the times. It is fooli&s;h,
in maintaining that the gout is not hereditary,
and that one fit of it, when gone, is like a
fever when gone.&endq;&mdash;Lady M'Leod objected
that the authour does not practice what he
teaches<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This was a general reflection again&s;t Dr. Cadogan, when his very popular book was fir&s;t publi&s;hed. It was &s;aid, that, whatever precepts he might give to others, he him&s;elf indulged freely in the bottle. But I have &s;ince had the plea|&s;ure of becoming acquainted with him, and, if his own te&s;ti|mony may be believed, (and I have never heard it impeached,) his cour&s;e of life has been conformable to his doctrine.</NOTE>.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;I cannot help that,
madam. That does not make his book the
wor&s;e. People are influenced more by what a
man &s;ays, if his practice is &s;uitable to it,&mdash;be|cau&s;e
they are blockheads. The more intel|lectual
people are, the readier will they attend
to what a man tells them. If it is ju&s;t, they
will follow it, be his practice what it will. No
man practi&s;es &s;o well as he writes. I have, all
my life long, been lying till noon; yet I tell
all young men, and tell them with great &s;in|cerity,
that nobody who does not ri&s;e early will
ever do any good. Only con&s;ider! You read a
book; you are convinced by it; you do not
know the authour. Suppo&s;e you afterwards
know him, and find that he does not practice
what he teaches; are you to give up your
former conviction? At this rate you would be
kept in a &s;tate of equilibrium, when reading
<PB N="253" REF="259">
every book, till you knew how the authour
practi&s;ed.&endq;&mdash;&startq;But, &s;aid Lady M'Leod, you
would think better of Dr. Cadogan, if he acted
according to his principles.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why,
madam, to be &s;ure, a man who acts in the
face of light, is wor&s;e than a man who does
not know &s;o much; yet I think no man &s;hould
be the wor&s;e thought of for publi&s;hing
good principles. There is &s;omething noble in
publi&s;hing truth, though it condemns one's
&s;elf.&endq;&mdash;I expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urprize at Cadogan's
recommending good humour, as if it were
quite in our own power to attain it.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Why, &s;ir, a man grows better humoured as
he grows older. He improves by experience.
When young, he thinks him&s;elf of great con|&s;equence,
and every thing of importance. As
he advances in life, he learns to think him&s;elf
of no con&s;equence, and little things of little
importance; and &s;o he becomes more patient,
and better plea&s;ed. All good-humour and
complai&s;ance are acquired. Naturally a child
&s;eizes directly what it &s;ees, and thinks of plea&s;|ing
it&s;elf only. By degrees, it is taught to
plea&s;e others, and to prefer others; and that
this will ultimately produce the greate&s;t hap|pine&s;s.
If a man is not convinced of that, he
never will practice it. Common language
&s;peaks the truth as to this: we &s;ay, a per&s;on
is well-<HI>bred.</HI> As it is &s;aid, that all material
<PB N="254" REF="260">
motion is primarily in a right line, and is
never <HI>per circuitum,</HI> never in another form, un|le&s;s
by &s;ome particular cau&s;e; &s;o it may be &s;aid
intellectual motion is.&endq;&mdash;Lady M'Leod a&s;ked,
if no man was naturally good?&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No,
madam, no more than a wolf.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;Nor
no woman, &s;ir.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, &s;ir.&endq;&mdash;Lady
M'Leod &s;tarted at this, &s;aying, low, &startq;This is
wor&s;e than Swift.&endq;</P>
<P>M'Leod of Ulini&s;h had come in the after|noon.
We were a jovial company at &s;upper.
The laird, &s;urrounded by &s;o many of his clan,
was to me a plea&s;ing &s;ight. They li&s;tened with
wonder and plea&s;ure, while Dr. John&s;on ha|rangued.
I am vexed that I cannot take down
his full &s;train of eloquence.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>Wedne&s;day, <DATE>15th September</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The gentlemen of the clan went away early
in the morning to the harbour of Lochbradale,
to take leave of &s;ome of their friends who were
going to America. It was a very wet day. We
looked at Rorie More's horn, which is a large
cow's horn, with the mouth of it ornamented
with &s;ilver curiou&s;ly carved. It holds rather
more than a bottle and a half. Every Laird
of M'Leod, it is &s;aid, mu&s;t, as a proof of his
manhood, drink it off full of claret, without
laying it down.&mdash;From Rorie More many of
the branches of the family are de&s;cended; in
<PB N="255" REF="261">
particular, the Tali&s;ker branch; &s;o that his
name is much talked of. We al&s;o &s;aw his bow,
which hardly any man now can bend, and his
<HI>Glaymore,</HI> which was wielded with both hands,
and is of a prodigious &s;ize. We &s;aw here &s;ome
old pieces of iron armour, immen&s;ely heavy.
The broad-&s;word now u&s;ed, though called the
<HI>Glaymore, (i. e.</HI> the <HI>great &s;word)</HI> is much &s;maller
than that u&s;ed in Rorie More's time. There
is hardly a target now to be found in the High|lands.
After the di&s;arming act, they made
them &s;erve as covers to their butter-milk bar|rels;
a kind of change, like beating &s;pears
into pruning-hooks.</P>
<P>Sir George Mackenzie's Works (the folio
edition) happened to lie in a window in the
dining-room. I a&s;ked Dr. John&s;on to look
at the <HI>Characteres Advocatorum.</HI> He allowed
him power of mind, and that he under&s;tood
very well what he tells; but &s;aid, that there
was too much declamation, and that the Latin
was not correct. He found fault with <HI>appro|pinquabant,</HI>
in the character of Gilmour. I
tried him with the oppo&s;ition between <HI>gloria</HI>
and <HI>palma,</HI> in the compari&s;on between Gilmour
and Ni&s;bet, which Lord Hailes, in his Cata|logue
of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion, thinks difficult
to be under&s;tood. The words are &startq;<HI>penes illum
gloria, penes hunc palma.</HI>&endq;&mdash;In a &s;hort Account
of the Kirk of Scotland, which I publi&s;hed
<PB N="256" REF="262">
&s;ome years ago, I applied the&s;e words to the
two contending parties, and explained them
thus: &startq;The popular party has mo&s;t eloquence;
Dr. Robert&s;on's party mo&s;t influence.&endq;&mdash;I was
very de&s;irous to hear Dr. John&s;on's explication.
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;I &s;ee no difficulty. Gilmour was
admired for his parts. Ni&s;bet carried his cau&s;e
by his &s;kill in law. <HI>Palma</HI> is victory.&endq;&mdash;I ob|&s;erved,
that the character of Nichol&s;on, in this
book, re&s;embled that of Burke: for it is &s;aid,
in one place, &startq;<HI>In omnes lu&s;os &amp; jocos &s;e &s;aepe re&s;ol|vebat;</HI>&endq;
and, in another, &startq;<HI>&s;ed accipitris more e

volatu, in praedam miro impetu de&s;cendebat.&endq;&mdash;
John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, &s;ir; I never heard Burke make
a good joke in my life.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;But, &s;ir,
you will allow he is a hawk.&endq;&mdash;Dr. John&s;on,
thinking that I meant this of his joking, &s;aid,
&startq;No, &s;ir, he is not the hawk there. He is
the beetle in the mire.&endq;&mdash;I &s;till adhered to my
metaphor,&mdash;&startq;But he <HI>&s;oars</HI> as the hawk.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John|&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Yes, &s;ir; but he catches nothing.&endq;&mdash;
M'Leod a&s;ked, what is the particular excell|ence
of Burke's eloquence?&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Copi|ou&s;ne&s;s,
and fertility of allu&s;ion; a power of
diver&s;ifying his matter, by placing it in various
relations. Burke has great knowledge, and
great command of language; though, in my
opinion, it has not in every re&s;pect the highe&s;t
elegance.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;Do you think, &s;ir,
<PB N="257" REF="263">
that Burke has read Cicero much?&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;I don't believe it, &s;ir. Burke has great
knowledge, great fluency of words, and great
promptne&s;s of ideas, &s;o that he can &s;peak with
great illu&s;tration on any &s;ubject that comes be|fore
him. He is neither like Cicero, nor like
Demo&s;thenes, nor like any one el&s;e, but &s;peaks
as well as he can.&endq;</P>
<P>In the 65th page of the fir&s;t volume of Sir
George Mackenzie, Dr. John&s;on pointed out a
paragraph beginning with <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and told
me there was an error in the text, which he bade
me try to di&s;cover. I was lucky enough to hit
it at once. As the pa&s;&s;age is printed, it is &s;aid

He had hitherto mo&s;t &s;trangely &s;lept without a

to us, he could not do it in moderation.&mdash;Lady
<PB N="258" REF="264">
M'Leod would hardly believe him, and &s;aid,
&startq;I am &s;ure, &s;ir, you would not carry it too
far.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Nay, madam, it carried me.
I took the opportunity of a long illne&s;s to leave
it off. It was then pre&s;cribed to me not to
drink wine; and having broken off the habit, I
have never returned to it.&endq;</P>
<P>In the argument on Tue&s;day night, about
natural goodne&s;s, Dr. John&s;on denied that any
child was better than another, but by difference
of in&s;truction; though, in con&s;equence of
greater attention being paid to in&s;truction by
one child than another, and of a variety of im|perceptible
cau&s;es, &s;uch as in&s;truction being
counteracted by &s;ervants, a notion was con|ceived,
that of two children, equally well edu|cated,
one was naturally much wor&s;e than ano|ther.
He owned, this morning, that one
might have a greater aptitude to learn than
another, and that we inherit di&s;po&s;itions from
our parents. &startq;I inherited, &s;aid he, a vile me|lancholy
from my father, which has made me
mad all my life, at lea&s;t not &s;ober.&endq;&mdash;Lady
M'Leod wondered he &s;hould tell this.&mdash;&startq;Ma|dam,
&s;aid I, he knows that with that madne&s;s
he is &s;uperior to other men.&endq;</P>
<P>I have often been a&s;toni&s;hed with what ex|actne&s;s
and per&s;picuity he will explain the pro|ce&s;s
of any art. He this morning explained to
us all the operation of coining, and, at night,
<PB N="259" REF="265">
all the operation of brewing, &s;o very clearly,
that Mr. M'Queen &s;aid, when he heard the
fir&s;t, he thought he had been bred in the Mint;
when he heard the &s;econd, that he had been
bred a brewer.</P>
<P>I was elated by the thought of having been
able to entice &s;uch a man to this remote part
of the world. A ludicrous, yet ju&s;t, image
pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my mind, which I expre&s;&s;ed
to the company. I compared my&s;elf to a dog
who has got hold of a large piece of meat, and
runs away with it to a corner, where he may
devour it in peace, without any fear of others
taking it from him. &startq;In London, Reynolds,
Beauclerk, and all of them, are contending
who &s;hall enjoy Dr. John&s;on's conver&s;ation.
We are fea&s;ting upon it, undi&s;turbed, at Dun|vegan.&endq;</P>
<P>It was &s;till a &s;torm of wind and rain. Dr.
John&s;on however walked out with M'Leod,
and &s;aw Rorie More's ca&s;cade in full perfection.
Colonel M'Leod, in&s;tead of being all life and
gaiety, as I have &s;een him, was at pre&s;ent grave,
and &s;omewhat depre&s;&s;ed by his anxious concern
about M'Leod's affairs, and finding &s;ome gen|tlemen
of the clan by no means di&s;po&s;ed to act
a generous or affectionate part to their Chief
in his di&s;tre&s;s, but bargaining with him as with
a &s;tranger. However, he was agreeable and
polite, and Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, he was a very
<PB N="260" REF="266">
plea&s;ing man.&mdash;My fellow-traveller and I
talked of going to Sweden; and, while we were
&s;ettling our plan, I expre&s;&s;ed a plea&s;ure in the
pro&s;pect of &s;eeing the king.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;I
doubt, &s;ir, if he would &s;peak to us.&endq;&mdash;Colonel
M'Leod &s;aid, &startq;I am &s;ure Mr. Bo&s;well would
&s;peak to <HI>him.</HI>&endq; But, &s;eeing me a little di&s;con|certed
by his remark, he politely added, &startq;and
with great propriety.&endq;&mdash;Here let me offer a
&s;hort defence of that propen&s;ity in my di&s;po&s;i|tion
to which this gentleman alluded. It has
procured me much happine&s;s. I hope it does
not de&s;erve &s;o hard a name as either forwardne&s;s
or impudence. If I know my&s;elf, it is nothing
more than an eagerne&s;s to &s;hare the &s;ociety of
men di&s;tingui&s;hed either by their rank or their
talents, and a diligence to attain what I de&s;ire.
If a man is prai&s;ed for &s;eeking knowledge,
though mountains and &s;eas are in his way, may
he not be pardoned, who&s;e ardour, in the pur|&s;uit
of the &s;ame object, leads him to encounter
difficulties as great, though of a different kind?</P>
<P>After the ladies were gone from table, we
talked of the Highlanders not having &s;heets;
and this led us to con&s;ider the advantage of
wearing linen.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;All animal &s;ub|&s;tances
are le&s;s cleanly than vegetables. Wool,
of which flannel is made, is an animal &s;ub|&s;tance;
flannel therefore is not &s;o cleanly as
linen. I remember I u&s;ed to think tar dirty;
<PB N="261" REF="267">
but when I knew it to be only a preparation of
the juice of the pine, I thought &s;o no longer.
It is not di&s;agreeable to have the gum that
oozes from a plumb-tree upon your fingers,
becau&s;e it is vegetable; but if you have any
candle-grea&s;e, any tallow upon your fingers,
you are unea&s;y till you rub it off.&mdash;I have
often thought, that, if I kept a &s;eraglio, the
ladies &s;hould all were linen gowns,&mdash;or cotton;
&mdash;I mean &s;tuffs made of vegetable &s;ub&s;tances.
I would have no &s;ilk; you cannot tell when it
is clean: It will be very na&s;ty before it is per|ceived
to be &s;o. Linen detects its own dirti|ne&s;s.&endq;</P>

&s;uch a variety of degrading images, of every
one of which I was the object, that, though I
can bear &s;uch attacks as well as mo&s;t men, I

<P>After dinner ye&s;terday, we had a conver&s;a|tion
upon cunning. M'Leod &s;aid that he was
not afraid of cunning people; but would let
them play their tricks about him like monkeys.
&startq;But, &s;aid I, they'll &s;cratch;&endq; and Mr.
M'Queen added, &startq;they'll invent new tricks,
as &s;oon as you find out what they do.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Cunning has effect from the credulity of
others, rather than from the abilities of tho&s;e
who are cunning. It requires no extraordinary
<PB N="263" REF="269">
talents to lye and deceive.&endq;&mdash;This led us to
con&s;ider whether it did not require great abili|ties
to be very wicked.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;It requires
great abilities to have the <HI>power</HI> of being very
wicked; but not to <HI>be</HI> very wicked. A man
who has the power, which great abilities pro|cure
him, may u&s;e it well or ill; and it requires
more abilities to u&s;e it well, than to u&s;e it ill.
Wickedne&s;s is always ea&s;ier than virtue; for it
takes the &s;hort cut to every thing. It is much
ea&s;ier to &s;teal a hundred pounds, than to get
it by labour, or any other way. Con&s;ider only
what act of wickedne&s;s requires great abilities
to commit it, when once the per&s;on who is to
do ti has the power; for <HI>there</HI> is the di&s;tinction.
It requires great abilities to conquer an army,
but none to ma&s;&s;acre it after it is conquered.&endq;</P>
<P>The weather this day was rather better than
any that we had &s;ince we came to Dunvegan.
Mr. M'Queen had often talked to me of a cu|rious
piece of antiquity near this, which he
called a temple of the Godde&s;s <HI>Anaitis.</HI> Having
often talked of going to &s;ee it, he and I &s;et out
after breakfa&s;t, attended by his man, a fellow
quite like a &s;avage. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here, that
in Sky there &s;eems to be much idlene&s;s; for
men and boys follow you, as colts follow
pa&s;&s;engers upon a road. The u&s;ual figure of a
Sky-boy, is a <HI>lown</HI> with bare legs and feet, a
dirty <HI>kilt,</HI> ragged coat and wai&s;tcoat, a bare
<PB N="264" REF="270">
head, and a &s;tick in his hand, which I &s;uppo&s;e
is partly to help the lazy rogue to walk, partly
to &s;erve as a kind of a defen&s;ive weapon. We
walked what is called two miles, but is probably
four, from the ca&s;tle, till we came to the &s;acred
place. The country around is a black dreary
moor on all &s;ides, except to the &s;ea-coa&s;t, to|wards
which there is a view through a valley;
and the farm of <HI>Bay</HI> &s;hews &s;ome good land.
The place it&s;elf is green ground, being well
drained, by means of a deep glen on each &s;ide,
in both of which there runs a rivulet with a
good quantity of water, forming &s;everal ca&s;|cades,
which make a con&s;iderable appearance
and &s;ound. The fir&s;t thing we came to was an
earthen mound, or dyke, extending from the
one precipice to the other. A little farther on,
was a &s;trong &s;tone wall, not high, but very
thick, extending in the &s;ame manner. On the
out&s;ide of it were the ruins of two hou&s;es, one
on each &s;ide of the entry or gate to it. The
wall is built all along of uncemented &s;tones,
but of &s;o large a &s;ize as to make a very firm
and durable rampart. It has been built all
about the con&s;ecrated ground, except where
the precipice is &s;teep enough to form an en|clo&s;ure
of it&s;elf. The &s;acred &s;pot contains
more than two acres. There are within it the
ruins of many hou&s;es, none of them large,&mdash;a
<HI>cairn,</HI>&mdash;and many graves marked by clu&s;ters of
<PB N="265" REF="271">
&s;tones. Mr. M'Queen in&s;i&s;ted that the ruin of
a &s;mall building, &s;tanding ea&s;t and we&s;t, was
actually the temple of the Godde&s;s <HI>Anaitis,</HI>
where her &s;tatue was kept, and from whence
proce&s;&s;ions were made to wa&s;h it in one of the
brooks. There is, it mu&s;t be owned, a hollow
road vi&s;ible for a good way from the entrance;
but Mr. M'Queen, with the keen eye of an an|tiquary,
traced it much farther than I could
perceive it. There is not above a foot and a
half in height of the walls now remaining;
and the whole extent of the building was never,
I imagine, greater than an ordinary Highland
hou&s;e. Mr. M'Queen has collected a great
deal of learning on the &s;ubject of the temple of
<HI>Anaitis;</HI> and I had endeavoured, in my Journal,
to &s;tate &s;uch particulars as might give &s;ome
idea of it, and of the &s;urrounding &s;cenery; but,
from the great difficulty of de&s;cribing vi&s;ible
objects, I found my account &s;o un&s;atisfactory,
that my readers would probably have ex|claimed
<Q><L>&startq;And write about it, <HI>Godde&s;s,</HI> and about it;&endq;</L></Q>
and therefore I have omitted it.</P>
<P>When we got home, and were again at table
with Dr. John&s;on, we fir&s;t talked of portraits.
He agreed in thinking them valuable in fami|lies.
I wi&s;hed to know which he preferred,
fine portraits, or tho&s;e of which the merit was
<PB N="266" REF="272">
re&s;emblance.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, their chief ex|cellence
is in being like.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;Are you
of that opinion, as to the portraits of ance&s;tors
whom one has never &s;een?&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;It then
becomes of more con&s;equence that they &s;hould
be like; and I would have them in the dre&s;s of
the times, which makes a piece of hi&s;tory.
One &s;hould like to &s;ee how <HI>Rorie More</HI> looked.
Truth, &s;ir, is of the greate&s;t value in the&s;e
things.&endq;&mdash;Mr. M'Queen ob&s;erved, that if you
think it of no con&s;equence whether portraits
are like, if they are but well painted, you may
be indifferent whether a piece of hi&s;tory is true
or not, if well told.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on &s;aid at breakfa&s;t to-day, &startq;that it
was but of late that hi&s;torians be&s;towed pains
and attention in con&s;ulting records, to attain
to accuracy. Bacon, in writing his Hi&s;tory of
Henry VII. does not &s;eem to have con&s;ulted
any, but to have ju&s;t taken what he found in
other hi&s;tories, and blended it with what he
learnt by tradition.&endq; He agreed with me that
there &s;hould be a chronicle kept in every con|&s;iderable
family, to pre&s;erve the characters and
tran&s;actions of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations.</P>
<P>After dinner I &s;tarted the &s;ubject of the
temple of <HI>Anaitis.</HI> Mr. M'Queen had laid &s;tre&s;s
on the name given to the place by the country
people, <HI>Ainnit,</HI> and added, &startq;I knew not
what to make of this piece of antiquity, till I
<PB N="267" REF="273">
met with the <HI>Anaitidis delubrum</HI> in Lydia, men|tioned
by Pau&s;anias and the elder Pliny.&endq;&mdash;Dr.
John&s;on, with his u&s;ual acutene&s;s, examined
Mr. M'Queen as to the meaning of the word
<HI>Ainnit,</HI> in Er&s;e; and it proved to be a <HI>water|place,</HI>
or a place near water, &startq;which, &s;aid Mr.
M'Queen, agrees with all the de&s;criptions of
the temples of that godde&s;s, which were &s;itu|ated
near rivers, that there might be water to
wa&s;h the &s;tatue.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Nay, &s;ir, the ar|gument
from the name is gone. The name is
exhau&s;ted by what we &s;ee. We have no occa|&s;ion
to go to a di&s;tance, for what we can pick
up under our feet. Had it been an accidental
name, the &s;imilarity between it and <HI>Anaitis</HI>
might have had &s;omething in it; but it turns
out to be a mere phy&s;iological name.&endq;&mdash;Mac|leod
&s;aid, Mr. M'Queen's knowledge of ety|mology
had de&s;troyed his conjecture.&mdash;<HI>John|&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Yes, &s;ir; Mr. M'Queen is like the eagle
mentioned by Waller, who was &s;hot with an
arrow feathered from his own wing.&endq;&mdash;Mr.
M'Queen would not, however, give up his con|jecture.
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;You have one po&s;&s;ibility
for you, and all po&s;&s;ibilities again&s;t you. It is
po&s;&s;ible it may be the temple of <HI>Anaitis.</HI> But
it is al&s;o po&s;&s;ible that it may be a fortification;
&mdash;or it may be a place of chri&s;tian wor&s;hip,
as the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians often cho&s;e remote and
wild places, to make an impre&s;&s;ion on the
mind;&mdash;or, if it was a heathen temple, it may
<PB N="268" REF="274">
have been built near a river, for the purpo&s;e of
lu&s;tration; and there is &s;uch a multitude of di|vinities,
to whom it may have been dedicated,
that the chance of its being a temple of <HI>Anaitis</HI>
is hardly any thing. It is like throwing a grain
of &s;and upon the &s;ea-&s;hore to-day, and thinking
you may find it to-morrow. No, &s;ir; this
temple, like many an ill-built edifice, tumbles
down before it is roofed in.&endq;&mdash;In his triumph
over the reverend antiquarian, he indulged
him&s;elf in a <HI>conceit;</HI> for, &s;ome ve&s;tige of the
<HI>altar</HI> of the godde&s;s being much in&s;i&s;ted on in
&s;upport of the hypothe&s;is, he &s;aid, &startq;Mr.
M'Queen is fighting <HI>pro</HI> aris <HI>et focis.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>It was wonderful how well time pa&s;&s;ed in a
remote ca&s;tle, and in dreary weather. After
&s;upper, we talked of Pennant. It was objected
that he was &s;uperficial. Dr. John&s;on defended
him warmly. He &s;aid, &startq;Pennant has greater
variety of inquiry than almo&s;t any man, and
has told us more than perhaps one in ten thou|&s;and
could have done, in the time that he took.
He has not &s;aid what he was to tell; &s;o you
cannot find fault with him, for what he has not
told. If a man comes to look for fi&s;hes, you
cannot blame him if he does not attend to
fowls.&endq;&mdash;&startq;But, &s;aid Colonel M'Leod, he men|tions
the unrea&s;onable ri&s;e of rents in the
Highlands, and &s;ays, &startq;the gentlemen are for
emptying the bag, without filling it;&endq; for that
is the phra&s;e he u&s;es. Why does he not tell
<PB N="269" REF="275">
how to fill it?&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, there is no end
of negative critici&s;m. He tells what he ob|&s;erves,
and as much as he choo&s;es. If he tells
what is not true, you may find fault with him;
but though he tells that the land is not well
cultivated, he is not obliged to tell how it may
be well cultivated. If I tell that many of the
Highlanders go bare-footed, I am not obliged
to tell how they may get &s;hoes. Pennant tells
a fact. He need go no farther, except he
plea&s;es. He exhau&s;ts nothing; and no &s;ubject
whatever has yet been exhau&s;ted. But Pennant
has &s;urely told a great deal. Here is a man &s;ix
feet high, and you are angry becau&s;e he is not
&s;even.&endq;&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding this eloquent <HI>Oratio
pro Pennantio,</HI> which they who have read this
gentleman's <HI>Tours,</HI> and recollect the <HI>Savage</HI> and
the <HI>Shopkeeper</HI> at <HI>Monboddo,</HI> will probably im|pute
to the &s;pirit of contradiction, I &s;till think
that he had better have given more attention to
fewer things, than have thrown together &s;uch
a number of imperfect accounts.</P>

<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>18th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Before breakfa&s;t, Dr. John&s;on came up to
my room, to forbid me to mention that this
was his birth-day; but I told him I had done
it already; at which he was di&s;plea&s;ed; I &s;up|po&s;e
from wi&s;hing to have nothing particular
done on his account. Lady M'Leod and I
got into a warm di&s;pute. She wanted to build
<PB N="270" REF="276">
a hou&s;e upon a farm which &s;he has taken, about
five miles from the ca&s;tle, and to make gardens
and other ornaments there; all of which I ap|proved
of; but in&s;i&s;ted that the &s;eat of the fa|mily
&s;hould always be upon the rock of Dun|vegan.
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Aye, in time we'll build
all round this rock. You may make a very
good hou&s;e at the farm; but it mu&s;t not be
&s;uch as to tempt the Laird of M'Leod to go
thither to re&s;ide. Mo&s;t of the great families of
England have a &s;econdary re&s;idence, which is
called a jointure-hou&s;e: let this be of that kind.&endq;
&mdash;The lady in&s;i&s;ted that the rock was very incon|venient;
that there was no place near it where
a good garden could be made; that it mu&s;t
always be a rude place; that it was a <HI>Herculean</HI>
labour to make a dinner here.&mdash;I was vexed to
find the alloy of modern refinement in a lady
who had &s;o much old family &s;pirit.&mdash;&startq;Madam,
&s;aid I, if once you quit this rock, there is no
knowing where you may &s;ettle. You move
five miles fir&s;t;&mdash;then to St. Andrew's, as the
late Laird did;&mdash;then to Edinburgh;&mdash;and &s;o
on, till you end at Hamp&s;tead, or in France.
No, no; keep to the rock: it is the very Jewel
of the e&s;tate. It looks as if it had been let
down from heaven by the four corners, to be
the re&s;idence of a Chief. Have all the com|forts
and conveniencies of life upon it, but
never leave Rorie More's ca&s;cade.&endq;&mdash;&startq;But
&s;aid &s;he, is it not enough if we keep it? Mu&s;t we
<PB N="271" REF="277">
never have more convenience than Rorie More
had? He had his beef brought to dinner in
one ba&s;ket, and his bread in another, Why
not as well be Rorie More all over, as live upon
his rock? And &s;hould not we tire, in looking
perpetually on this rock? It is very well for
you, who have a fine place, and every thing
ea&s;y, to talk thus, and think of chaining hone&s;t
folks to a rock. You would not live upon it
your&s;elf.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Yes, madam, &s;aid I; I would live
upon it, were I Laird of M'Leod, and &s;hould
be unhappy if I were not upon it.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
(with a &s;trong voice, and mo&s;t determined
manner,) &startq;Madam, rather than quit the old
rock, Bo&s;well would live in the pit; he
would make his bed in the dungeon.&endq;&mdash;I felt a
degree of elation, at finding my re&s;olute feudal
enthu&s;ia&s;m thus confirmed by &s;uch a &s;anction.
The lady was puzzled a little. She &s;till re|turned
to her pretty farm,&mdash;rich ground,&mdash;fine
garden.&mdash;&startq;Madam, &s;aid Dr. John&s;on, were they
in A&s;ia, I would not leave the rock.&endq;&mdash;My
opinion on this &s;ubject is &s;till the &s;ame. An
ancient family re&s;idence ought to be a primary
object; and though the &s;ituation of Dunvegan
be &s;uch that little can be done here in garden|ing,
or plea&s;ure-ground, yet, in addition to the
veneration acquired by the lap&s;e of time, it has
many circum&s;tances of natural grandeur &s;uited
to the &s;eat of a Highland Chief: it has the &s;ea,
<PB N="272" REF="278">
&mdash;i&s;lands,&mdash;rocks,&mdash;hills,&mdash;a noble ca&s;cade;
and when the family is again in opulence,
&s;omething may be done by art.</P>
<P>Mr. Donald M'Queen went away to-day, in
order to preach at Bracadale next day. We
were &s;o comfortably &s;ituated at Dunvegan,
that Dr. John&s;on could hardly be moved from
it. I propo&s;ed to him that we &s;hould leave
it on Monday. &startq;No, &s;ir, &s;aid he; I will not
go before Wedne&s;day. I will have &s;ome more
of this good.&endq;&mdash;However, as the weather was
at this &s;ea&s;on &s;o bad, and &s;o very uncertain,
and we had a great deal to do yet, Mr.
M'Queen and I prevailed with him to agree to
&s;et out on Monday, if the day &s;hould be good.
Mr. M'Queen, though it was inconvenient for
him to be ab&s;ent from his harve&s;t, engaged to
wait on Monday at Ulini&s;h for us. When he
was going away, Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;I &s;hall
ever retain a great regard for you.&endq; Then
a&s;ked him if he had the <HI>Rambler.</HI>&mdash;Mr.
M'Queen &s;aid, &startq;No; but my brother has it.&endq;
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Have you the <HI>Idler?</HI>&endq;&mdash;<HI>M'Queen.</HI>
&startq;No, &s;ir.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Then I will order one
for you at Edinburgh, which you will keep in
remembrance of me.&endq;&mdash;Mr. M'Queen was
much plea&s;ed with this. He expre&s;&s;ed to me,
in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, his admiration of Dr.
John&s;on's wonderful knowledge, and every
other quality for which he is di&s;tingui&s;hed. I
<PB N="273" REF="279">
a&s;ked Mr. M'Queen, if he was &s;atisfied with
being a mini&s;ter in Sky. He &s;aid he was; but he
owned that his forefathers having been &s;o long
there, and his having been born there, made
a chief ingredient in forming his contentment.
I &s;hould have mentioned, that, on our left
hand, between Portree and Dr. M'Leod's
hou&s;e, Mr. M'Queen told me there had been
a college of the Knights Templars; that tra|dition
&s;aid &s;o; and that there was a ruin re|maining
of their church which had been burnt:
but I confe&s;s Dr. John&s;on has weakened my
belief in remote tradition. In the di&s;pute
about <HI>Anaitis,</HI> Mr. M'Queen &s;aid, A&s;ia Minor
was peopled by Scythians, and, as they were
the ance&s;tors of the Celts, the &s;ame religion
might be in A&s;ia Minor and Sky.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Alas!&endq; &s;ir, what can a nation that has not
letters tell of its original. I have always diffi|culty
to be patient when I hear authours gravely
quoted, as giving accounts of &s;avage nations,
which accounts they had from the &s;avages
them&s;elves. What can the <HI>M'Craas</HI> tell about
them&s;elves a thou&s;and years ago? There is no
tracing the connection of ancient nations, but
by language; and therefore I am always &s;orry
when any language is lo&s;t, becau&s;e languages
are the pedigree of nations. If you find the
&s;ame language in di&s;tant countries, you may be
&s;ure that the inhabitants of each have been the
<PB N="274" REF="280">
&s;ame people; that is to &s;ay, if you find the
languages a good deal the &s;ame; for a word
here and there being the &s;ame, will not do.
Thus Butler, in his <HI>Hudibras,</HI> remembering
that <HI>Penguin,</HI> in the Straits of Magellan, &s;igni|fies
a bird with a white head, and that the &s;ame
word has, in Wales, the &s;ignification of a
white-headed wench, <HI>(pen</HI> head, and <HI>guin</HI>
white,) by way of ridicule, concludes that the
people of tho&s;e Straits are Welch.</P>
<P>A young gentleman of the name of M'Lean,
nephew to the Laird of the i&s;le of Muck, came
this morning; and, ju&s;t as we &s;at down to din|ner,
came the Laird of the i&s;le of Muck him|&s;elf,
his lady, &s;i&s;ter to Tali&s;ker, two other ladies
their relations, and a daughter of the late
M'Leod of Hamer, who wrote a treati&s;e on
the &s;econd &s;ight, under the de&s;ignation of
<HI>Theophilus In&s;ulanus.</HI> It was &s;omewhat droll to
hear this Laird called by his title. <HI>Muck</HI> would
have &s;ounded ill; &s;o he was called <HI>I&s;le of Muck,</HI>
which went off with great readine&s;s. The
name, as now written, is un&s;eemly, but is not
&s;o bad in the original Er&s;e, which is <HI>Mouach,</HI>
&s;ignifying the Sows' I&s;land. Buchanan calls it
<HI>In&s;ula Porcorum.</HI> It is &s;o called from its form.
Some call it I&s;le of <HI>Monk.</HI> The Laird in&s;i&s;ts
that this is the proper name. It was formerly
church-land belonging to Icolmkill, and a
hermit lived in it. It is two miles long, and
<PB N="275" REF="281">
about three quarters of a mile broad. The
Laird &s;aid he had &s;even &s;core of &s;ouls upon it.
La&s;t year he had eighty per&s;ons inoculated,
mo&s;tly children, but &s;ome of them eighteen
years of age. He agreed with a &s;urgeon to
come and do it, at half a crown a head.&mdash;It is
very fertile in corn, of which they export &s;ome;
and its coa&s;ts abound in fi&s;h. A taylor comes
there &s;ix times in a year. They get a good
black&s;mith from the i&s;le of Egg.</P>

<P>It was rather wor&s;e weather than any that
we had yet. At breakfa&s;t Dr. John&s;on &s;aid,
&startq;Some cunning men choo&s;e fools for their
wives, thinking to manage them, but they
always fail. There is a &s;paniel fool and a
mule fool. The &s;paniel fool may be made to
do by beating. The mule fool will neither do
by words nor blows; and the &s;paniel fool often
turns mule at la&s;t: and &s;uppo&s;e a fool to be
made do pretty well, you mu&s;t have the conti|nual
trouble of making her do. Depend upon
it, no woman is the wor&s;e for &s;en&s;e and know|ledge.&endq;
&mdash;Whether afterwards he meant merely
to &s;ay a polite thing, or to give his opinion, I
could not be &s;ure: but he added, &startq;Men know
that women are an over-match for them, and
therefore they choo&s;e the weake&s;t or mo&s;t igno|rant.
If they did not think &s;o, they never
<PB N="276" REF="282">
could be afraid of women knowing as much as
them&s;elves.&endq;&mdash;In ju&s;tice to the &s;ex, I think it
but candid to acknowledge, that, in a &s;ub&s;e|quent
conver&s;ation, he told me that he was
&s;erious in what he had &s;aid.</P>
<P>He came to my room this morning before
breakfa&s;t, to read my Journal, which he has
done all along. He often before &s;aid, &startq;I take
great delight in reading it.&endq; To-day he &s;aid,
&startq;You improve: it grows better and better.&endq;&mdash;
I ob&s;erved, there as a danger of my getting a
habit of writing in a &s;lovenly manner.&mdash;&startq;Sir,
&s;aid he, it is not written in a &s;lovenly manner. It
might be printed, were the &s;ubject fit for print|ing
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">As I have faithfully recorded &s;o many minute particulars, I hope I &s;hall be pardoned for indulging my vanity in in&s;erting &s;o flattering an encomium on what is now offered to the publick.</NOTE>.&endq;&mdash;While Mr. Beaton preached to us in
the dining-room, Dr. John&s;on &s;at in his own
room, where I &s;aw lying before him, a volume
of Lord Bacon's works, the <HI>Decay of Chri&s;tian
Piety,</HI> Monboddo's <HI>Origin of Language,</HI> and
Sterne's Sermons.&mdash;He a&s;ked me to-day, how
we were &s;o little together? I told him, my
Journal took up much time. Yet, on reflec|tion,
it appeared &s;trange to me, that although
I will run from one end of London to another,
to pa&s;s an hour with him, I &s;hould omit to &s;eize
any &s;pare time to be in his company, when I
<PB N="277" REF="283">
am &s;ettled in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him. But my
Journal is really a ta&s;k of much time and la|bour,
and he forbids me to contract it.</P>
<P>I omitted to mention, in its place, that Dr.
John&s;on told Mr. M'Queen that he had found
the belief of the &s;econd &s;ight univer&s;al in Sky,
except among the clergy, who &s;eemed deter|mined
again&s;t it. I took the liberty to ob&s;erve
to Mr. M'Queen, that the clergy were actuated
by a kind of vanity. &startq;The world (&s;ay they)
takes us to be credulous men in a remote cor|ner.
We'll &s;hew them that we are more en|lightened
than they think.&endq; The worthy man
&s;aid, that his di&s;belief of it was from his not
finding &s;ufficient evidence; but I could per|ceive
that he was prejudiced again&s;t it.</P>
<P>After dinner to-day, we talked of the extraor|dinary
fact of Lady Grange's being &s;ent to
St. Kilda, and confined there for &s;everal years,
without any means of relief<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The true &s;tory of this lady, which happened in this cen|tury, is as frightfully romantick as if it had been the fiction of a gloomy fancy. She was the wife of one of the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion is Scotland, a man of the very fir&s;t blood of his coun|try. For &s;ome my&s;terious rea&s;ons, which have never been di&s;covered, &s;he was &s;eized and carried off in the dark, &s;he knew not by whom, any nightly journies was conveyed to the Highland &s;hores, from whence &s;he was tran&s;ported by &s;ea to the remote rock of St. Kilda, where &s;he remained, among&s;t its few wild inhabitants, a forlorn pri&s;oner, but had a con|&s;tant &s;upply of provi&s;ions, and a woman to wait on her. No inquiry was made after her, till &s;he at at la&s;t found means to convey a letter to a confidential friend, by the daughter of a Catechi&s;t, who concealed it in a clue of yarn. Information being thus obtained at Edinburgh, a &s;hip was &s;ent to bring her off; but intelligence of this being received, &s;he was con|veyed to M'Leod's i&s;land of Herries, where &s;he died.</P>
<P>In <HI>Car&s;tares's State Papers,</HI> we find an authentick narrative of Connor, a catholick prie&s;t, who turned prote&s;tant, being &s;eized by &s;ome of Lord Seaforth's people, and detained pri|&s;oner in the i&s;land of Herries &s;everal years; he was fed with bread and water, and lodged in a hou&s;e where he was expo&s;ed to the rains and cold. Sir James Ogilvy writes, (June 18, 1667,) that the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Advocate, and him&s;elf, were to meet next day, to take effectual methods to have this redre&s;&s;ed. Connor was then &s;till detained. P. 310.&mdash;This &s;hews what private oppre&s;&s;ion might in the la&s;t century be practi&s;ed in the Hebrides.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame collection, the Earl of Argyll gives a pictu|re&s;que account of an emba&s;&s;y from <HI>the great M'Neil of Barra,</HI> as that in&s;ular Chief u&s;ed to be denominated.&mdash;&startq;I received a letter ye&s;terday from M'Neil of Barra, who lives very far off, &s;ent by a gentleman in all formality, offering his &s;ervice, which had made you laugh to &s;ee his entry. His &s;tile of his letter runs as if he were of another kingdom.&endq;&mdash;P. 643.</P></NOTE>. Dr. John&s;on

&s;aid, if M'Leod would let it be known that he
had &s;uch a place for naughty ladies, he might
make it a very profitable i&s;land.&mdash;We had, in
the cour&s;e of our tour, heard of St. Kilda poe|try.
Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved, &startq;it mu&s;t be very
poor, becau&s;e they have very few images.&endq;&mdash;
<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;There may be a poetical genius
&s;hewn in combining the&s;e, and in making
poetry of them.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, a man can|not
make fire but in proportion as he has fuel.
He cannot coin guineas but in proportion as
he has gold.&endq;&mdash;At tea, he talked of his intend|ing
<PB N="279" REF="285">
to go to Italy in 1775. M'Leod &s;aid, he
would like Paris better.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, &s;ir;
there is none of the French literati now alive,
to vi&s;it whom I would cro&s;s a &s;ea. I can find
in Buffon's book all that he can &s;ay<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I doubt the ju&s;tice of my fellow-traveller's remark con|cerning the French literati, many of whom, I am told, have con&s;iderable merit in conver&s;ation, as well as in their writings.

<P>After &s;upper he &s;aid, &startq;I am &s;orry that prize-fighting
is gone out; every art &s;hould be pre|&s;erved,
and the art of defence is &s;urely im|portant.
It is ab&s;urd that our &s;oldiers &s;hould
have &s;words, and not be taught the u&s;e of
them. Prize-fighting made people accu&s;tomed
not to be alarmed at &s;eeing their own blood,
or feeling a little pain from a wound. I think
the heavy <HI>glaymore</HI> was an ill-contrived wea|pon.
A man could only &s;trike once with it.
It employed both his hands, and he mu&s;t of
cour&s;e be &s;oon fatigued with wielding it; &s;o
that if his antagoni&s;t could only keep playing a
while, he was &s;ure of him. I would fight with
a dirk again&s;t Rorie More's &s;word. I could
ward off a blow with a dirk, and then run in
upon my enemy. When within that heavy
&s;word, I have him; he is quite helple&s;s, and
I could &s;tab him at my lei&s;ure, like a calf.&mdash;It
is thought by &s;en&s;ible military men, that the
<PB N="280" REF="286">
Engli&s;h do not enough avail them&s;elves of
their &s;uperior &s;trength of body again&s;t the
French; for that mu&s;t always have a great
advantage in pu&s;hing with bayonets. I have
heard an officer &s;ay, that if women could be
made to &s;tand, they would do as well as men
in a mere interchange of bullets from a di&s;|tance;
but if a body of men &s;hould come
clo&s;e up to them, then to be &s;ure they mu&s;t be
overcome; now, &s;aid he, in the &s;ame manner
the weaker-bodied French mu&s;t be overcome
by our &s;trong &s;oldiers.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of duelling was introduced.&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;There is no ca&s;e in England where
one or other of the combatants <HI>mu&s;t</HI> die; if you
have overcome your adver&s;ary by di&s;arming
him, that is &s;ufficient, though you &s;hould not
kill him; your honour, or the honour of your
family, is re&s;tored, as much as it can be by a
duel. It is cowardly to force your antagoni&s;t
to renew the combat, when you know that you
have the advantage of him by &s;uperior &s;kill.
You might ju&s;t as well go and cut his throat
while he is a&s;leep in his bed. When a duel
begins, it is &s;uppo&s;ed there may be an equa|lity;
becau&s;e it is not always &s;kill that prevails.
It depends much on pre&s;ence of mind; nay on
accidents. The wind may be in a man's face.
He may fall. Many &s;uch things may decide
the &s;uperiority.&mdash;A man is &s;ufficiently pu|ni&s;hed,
<PB N="281" REF="287">
by being called out, and &s;ubjected to
the ri&s;k that is in a duel.&endq;&mdash;But on my &s;ug|ge&s;ting
that the injured per&s;on is equally &s;ub|jected
to ri&s;k, he fairly owned he could not ex|plain
the rationality of duelling.</P>

<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>20th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>When I awaked, the &s;torm was higher &s;till.
It abated about nine, and the &s;un &s;hone; but
it rained again very &s;oon, and it was not a day
for travelling. At breakfa&s;t, Dr. John&s;on told
us, that there was once a pretty good tavern in
Catharine-&s;treet in the Strand, where very good
company met in an evening, and each man
called for his own half-pint of wine, or gill, if
he plea&s;ed; they were frugal men, and nobody
paid but for what he him&s;elf drank. The
hou&s;e furni&s;hed no &s;upper; but a woman at|tended
with mutton-pies, which any body
might purcha&s;e. He was introduced to this
company by Cumming the Quaker, and u&s;ed
to go there &s;ometimes when he drank wine.
He &s;aid, that in the la&s;t age, when his mother
lived in London, there were two &s;ets of people,
tho&s;e who gave the wall, and tho&s;e who took
it; the peaceable and the quarrel&s;ome. When
he returned to Lichfield, after having been in
London, his mother a&s;ked him, whether he
was one of tho&s;e who gave the wall, or tho&s;e
who took it? &startq;Now, &s;aid he, it is fixed that
<PB N="282" REF="288">
every man keeps to the right; or, if one is
taking the wall, another yields it, and it is
never a di&s;pute.&endq;&mdash;He was very &s;evere on a
lady, who&s;e name was mentioned. He &s;aid, he
would have her &s;ent to St. Kilda. That &s;he was
as bad as negative badne&s;s could be, and &s;tood
in the way of what was good: that in&s;ipid
beauty would not go a great way; and that
&s;uch a woman might be cut out of a cabbage,
if there was a &s;kilful artificer.</P>
<P>M'Leod was too late in coming to breakfa&s;t.
Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, lazine&s;s was wor&s;e than the
tooth-ach.&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;I cannot agree with you,
&s;ir; a ba&s;on of cold water, or a hor&s;e-whip,
will cure lazine&s;s.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, &s;ir; it will
only put off the fit; it will not cure the di&s;ea&s;e.
I have been trying to cure my lazine&s;s all my
life, and could not do it.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;But if a
man does in a &s;horter time what might be the
labour of a life, there is nothing to be &s;aid
again&s;t him.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on</HI> (perceiving at once that
I alluded to him and his Dictionary). &startq;Suppo&s;e
that flattery to be true, the con&s;equence would
be, that the world would have no right to cen|&s;ure
a man; but that will not ju&s;tify him to
him&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, he &s;aid to me, &startq;A High|land
Chief &s;hould now endeavour to do every
thing to rai&s;e his rents, by means of the indu&s;try
of his people. Formerly, it was right for him
<PB N="283" REF="289">
to have his hou&s;e full of idle fellows; they
were his defenders, his &s;ervants, his dependants,
his friends. Now they may be better employed.
The &s;y&s;tem of things is now &s;o much altered,
that the family cannot have influence but by
riches, becau&s;e it has no longer the power of
ancient feudal times. An individual of a fa|mily
may have it; but it cannot now belong to
a family, unle&s;s you could have a perpetuity of
men with the &s;ame views. M'Leod has four
times the land that the Duke of Bedford has.
I think, with his &s;pirit, he may in time make
him&s;elf the greate&s;t man in the king's domi|nions;
for land may always be improved to a
certain degree. I would never have any man
&s;ell land, to throw money into the funds, as is
often done, or to try any other &s;pecies of trade.
Depend upon it, this rage of trade will de&s;troy
it&s;elf. You and I &s;hall not &s;ee it; but the time
will come when there will be an end of it.
Trade is like gaming. If a whole company
are game&s;ters, play mu&s;t cea&s;e; for there is no|thing
to be won. When all nations are traders,
there is nothing to be gained by trade, and it
will &s;top fir&s;t where it is brought to the greate&s;t
perfection. Then the proprietors of land only
will be the great men.&endq;&mdash;I ob&s;erved, it was
hard that M'Leod &s;hould find ingratitude in &s;o
many of this people.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, gratitude
is a fruit of great cultivation; you do not find
<PB N="284" REF="290">
it among gro&s;s people.&endq;&mdash;I doubt of this. Na|ture
&s;eems to have implanted gratitude in all
living creatures. The lion, mentioned by
Valerius Maximus, had it. It appears to me
that culture, which brings luxury and &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s
with it, has a tendency rather to weaken
then promote this affection.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on &s;aid this morning, when talking
of our &s;etting out, that he was in the &s;tate in
which Lord Bacon repre&s;ents kings. He de&s;ired
the end, but did not like the means. He wi&s;hed
much to get home, but was unwilling to travel
in Sky.&mdash;&startq;You are like kings too in this, &s;ir,

<P>The uncertainty of our pre&s;ent &s;ituation
having prevented me from receiving any letters
from home for &s;ome time, I could not help
being unea&s;y. Dr. John&s;on had an advantage

to &s;et out. But, before quitting this ca&s;tle,
where we have been &s;o well entertained, let me
give a &s;hort de&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>Along the edge of the rock, there are the
remains of a wall, which is now covered with
ivy. A &s;quare court is formed by buildings
<PB N="285" REF="291">
of different ages, particularly &s;ome towers,
&s;aid to be of great antiquity; and at one place
there is a row of fal&s;e cannon, of &s;tone. There
is a very large unfini&s;hed pile, four &s;tories high,
which we were told was here when <HI>Leod,</HI> the
fir&s;t of this family, came from the I&s;le of Man,
married the heire&s;s of the M'Crails, the ancient
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of Dunvegan, and afterwards ac|quired
by conque&s;t as much land as he had got
by marriage. He &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria; for he was <HI>felix</HI> both <HI>bella gerere</HI> et

ordered the following in&s;cription, compo&s;ed

<P>M'Leod and Tali&s;her accompanied us. We
pa&s;&s;ed by the pari&s;h church of <HI>Durini&s;h.</HI> The
church-yard is not enclo&s;ed, but a pretty mur|muring
brook runs along one &s;ide of it.
In it is a pyramid erected to the memory of
Thomas Lord Lovat, by his &s;on Lord Simon,
who &s;uffered on Tower-hill. It is of free-&s;tone,
and, I &s;uppo&s;e, about thirty feet high. There
is an in&s;cription on a piece of white marble
in&s;erted in it, which I &s;u&s;pect to have been the
compo&s;ition of Lord Lovat him&s;elf, being much
in his pompous &s;tyle:</P>
<P>&startq;This pyramid was erected by SIMON
LORD FRASER of LOVAT, in honour of Lord
THOMAS his Father, a Peer of Scotland, and
Chief of the great and ancient Clan of the
FRASERS. Being attacked for his birthright
by the family of ATHOLL, then in power and
favour with KING WILLIAM, yet, by the valour
and fidelity of his clan, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
CAMPBELLS, the old friends and allies of his
family, he defended his birthright with &s;uch
greatne&s;s and fermety of &s;oul, and &s;uch valour
<PB N="287" REF="293">
and activity, that he was an honour to his
name, and a good pattern to all brave Chiefs
of cians. He died in the month of May, 1699,
in the 63d year of his age, in Dunvegan,
the hou&s;e of the LAIRD of MAC LEOD, who&s;e
&s;i&s;ter he had married; by whom he had the
above SIMON LORD FRASER, and &s;everal other
children. And, for the great love he bore to
the family of MAC LEOD, he de&s;ired to be
buried near his wife's relations, in the place
where two of her uncles lay. And his &s;on,
LORD SIMON, to &s;hew to po&s;terity his great
affection for his Mother's kindred, the brave
MAC LEODS, choo&s;es rather to leave his father's
bones with them, than carry them to his own
burial-place, near Lovat.&endq;</P>
<P>I have pre&s;erved this in&s;cription, though of
no great value, thinking it characteri&s;tical of a
man who has made &s;ome noi&s;e in the world.
Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, it was poor &s;tuff, &s;uch as
Lord Lovat's butler might have written.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, in this church-yard, a parcel of
people a&s;&s;embled at a funeral, before the grave
was dug. The coffin, with the corp&s;e in it,
was placed on the ground, while the people
alternately a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making a grave. One
man, at a little di&s;tance, was bu&s;y cutting a
long turf for it, with the crooked &s;pade which
is u&s;ed in Sky-; a very aukward in&s;trument.
<PB N="288" REF="294">
The iron part of it is like a plow-coulter. It
has a rude tree for a handle, in which a wooden
pin is placed for the foot to pre&s;s upon. A
traveller might, without farther inquiry, have
&s;et this down as the mode of burying in Sky.
I was told, however, that the u&s;ual way is to
have a grave previou&s;ly dug.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved to-day, that the common way of
carrying home their grain here is in loads on
hor&s;eback. They have al&s;o a few &s;leds, or
<HI>cars,</HI> as we call them in Ayr&s;hire, clum&s;ily
made, and rarely u&s;ed.</P>
<P>We got to Ulini&s;h about &s;ix o'clock, and
found a very good farm-hou&s;e of two &s;tories.
Mr. M'Leod of Ulini&s;h, the &s;heriff-&s;ub&s;titute
of the i&s;land, was a plain hone&s;t gentleman, a
good deal like an Engli&s;h ju&s;tice of peace; not
much given to talk, but &s;ufficently &s;agacious,
and &s;omewhat droll. His daughter, though
&s;he was never out of Sky, was a very well-bred
woman.&mdash;Our reverend friend, Mr. Donald
M'Queen, kept his appointment, and met us
here.</P>
<P>Talking of Phipps's voyage to the North
Pole, Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved, that it &startq;was conjec|tured
that our former navigators have kept too
near land, and &s;o have found the &s;ea frozen far
north, becau&s;e the land hinders the free motion
of the tide; but, in the wide ocean, where the
waves tumble at their full convenience, it is
imagined that the fro&s;t does not take effect.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>Wedne&s;day, <DATE>22d September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>In the morning I walked out, and &s;aw a
&s;hip, the Margaret of Clyde, pa&s;s by with a
number of emigrants on board. It was a me|lancholy
&s;ight.&mdash;After breakfa&s;t, we went to &s;ee
what was called a &s;ubterraneous hou&s;e, about a
&s;hort mile off. It was upon the &s;ide of a ri&s;ing-ground.
It was di&s;covered by a fox's having
taken up his abode in it, and in chacing him,
they dug into it. It was very narrow and low,
and &s;eemed about forty feet in length. Near
it, we found the foundations of &s;everal &s;mall
huts, built of &s;tone.&mdash;Mr. M'Queen, who is
always for making every thing as ancient as
po&s;&s;ible, boa&s;ted that it was the dwelling of
&s;ome of the fir&s;t inhabitants of the i&s;land, and
ob&s;erved, what a curio&s;ity it was to find here a
&s;pecimen of the hou&s;es of the <HI>Aborigines,</HI> which
he believed could be found no where el&s;e; and
it was plain that they lived without fire.&mdash;Dr.
John&s;on remarked, that they who made this
were not in the rude&s;t &s;tate; for that it was
more difficult to make <HI>it</HI> than to build a hou&s;e;
therefore certainly tho&s;e who made it were in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of hou&s;es, and had this only as a
hiding-place.&mdash;It appeared to me, that the
ve&s;tiges of hou&s;es, ju&s;t by it, confirmed Dr.
John&s;on's opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="296">
From an old tower, near this place, is an
exten&s;ive view of Loch-Braccadil, and, at a
di&s;tance, of the i&s;les of Barra and South Ui&s;t;
and on the land-&s;ide, the <HI>Cuillin,</HI> a prodigious
range of mountains, capped with rocky pin|nacles
in a &s;trange variety of &s;hapes. They
re&s;emble the mountains near Cort&eacute; in Cor&s;ica,
of which there is a very good print. They make
part of a great range for deer, which, though
entirely devoid of trees, is in the&s;e countries
called a <HI>fore&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>In the afternoon, Ulini&s;h carried us in his
boat to an i&s;land po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by him, where we
&s;aw an immen&s;e cave, much more de&s;erving
the title of <HI>antrum immane</HI> than that of the Sybil
de&s;cribed by Virgil, which I likewi&s;e have
vi&s;ited. It is one hundred and eighty feet long,
about thirty feet broad, and at lea&s;t thirty feet
high. This cave, we were told, had a remark|able
echo; but we found none. They &s;aid it
was owing to the great rains having made it
damp. Such are the excu&s;es by which the
exaggeration of Highland narratives is pal|liated.
&mdash;There is a plentiful garden at Ulini&s;h,
(a great rarity in Sky) and &s;everal trees; and
near the hou&s;e is a hill, which has an Er&s;e
name, &s;ignifying &startq;<HI>the hill of &s;trife,</HI>&endq; where,
Mr. M'Queen informed us, ju&s;tice was of old
admini&s;tered. It is like the <HI>mons placiti</HI> of
<HI>Scone,</HI> or tho&s;e hills which are called <HI>laws,</HI> &s;uch
<PB N="291" REF="297">
as Kelly <HI>law,</HI> North-Berwick <HI>law,</HI> and &s;everal
others. It is &s;ingular that this &s;pot &s;hould
happen now to be the &s;heriff's re&s;idence.</P>
<P>We had a very cheerful evening, and Dr.
John&s;on talked a good deal on the &s;ubject of
literature.&mdash;Speaking of the noble family of
Boyle, he &s;aid, that all the Lord Orrerys, till
the pre&s;ent, had been writers. The fir&s;t wrote
&s;everal plays; the &s;econd was Bentley's anta|goni&s;t;
the third wrote the Life of Swift, and
&s;everal other things; his &s;on Hamilton wrote
&s;ome papers in the <HI>Adventurer</HI> and <HI>World.</HI> He
told us, he was well acquainted with Swift's
Lord Orrery. He &s;aid, he was a feeble-minded
man; that, on the publication of Dr. De|lany's
<HI>Remarks</HI> on his book, he was &s;o much
alarmed that he was afraid to read them. Dr.
John&s;on comforted him, by telling him they
were both in the right; that Delany had &s;een
mo&s;t of the good &s;ide of Swift,&mdash;Lord Orrery
mo&s;t of the bad.&mdash;M'Leod a&s;ked, if it was not
wrong in Orrery to expo&s;e the defects of a man
with whom he lived in intimacy.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why
no, &s;ir, after the man is dead; for then it is done
hi&s;torically.&endq; He added, &startq;If Lord Orrery had
been rich, he would have been a very liberal pa|tron.
His conver&s;ation was like his writings, neat
and elegant, but without &s;trength. He gra&s;ped
at more than his abilities could reach; tried
to pa&s;s for a better talker, a better writer, and
<PB N="292" REF="298">
a better thinker, than he was. There was a
quarrel between him and his father, in which
his father was to blame; becau&s;e it aro&s;e from
the &s;on's not allowing his wife to keep company
with his father's mi&s;tre&s;s. The old lord &s;hewed
his re&s;entment in his will,&mdash;leaving his library
from his &s;on, and a&s;&s;igning, as his rea&s;on, that
he could not make u&s;e of it.&endq;</P>
<P>I mentioned the affectation of Orrery, in
ending all his letters on the Life of Swift in
&s;tudied varieties of phra&s;e, and never in the
common mode of &startq;<HI>I am,</HI> &amp;c.&endq; an ob&s;ervation
which I remember to have been made &s;everal
years ago by old Mr. Sheridan. This &s;pecies
of affectation in writing, as a foreign lady of
di&s;tingui&s;hed talents once remarked to me, is
almo&s;t peculiar to the Engli&s;h. I took up a
volume of Dryden, containing the <HI>Conque&s;t
of Granada,</HI> and &s;everal other plays, of which
all the dedications had &s;uch &s;tudied conclu&s;ions.
Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &s;uch conclu&s;ions were more
elegant, and, in addre&s;&s;ing per&s;ons of high rank,
(as when Dryden dedicated to the Duke of
York, they were likewi&s;e more re&s;pectful. I
agreed that <HI>there</HI> it was much better: it was
making his e&s;cape from the Royal pre&s;ence
with a genteel &s;udden timidity, in place of
having the re&s;olution to &s;tand &s;till, and make a
formal bow.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="299">
Lord Orrery's unkind treatment of his &s;on
in his will, led us to talk of the di&s;po&s;itions a
man &s;hould have when dying. I &s;aid, I did
not &s;ee why a man &s;hould act differently with
re&s;pect to tho&s;e of whom he thought ill when in
health, merely becau&s;e he was dying.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;I &s;hould not &s;cruple to &s;peak again&s;t a party,
when dying; but &s;hould not do it again&s;t an
individual.&mdash;It is told of Sixtus Quintus, that
on his death-bed, in the intervals of his la&s;t
pangs, he &s;igned death-warrants.&endq;&mdash;Mr.
M'Queen &s;aid, he &s;hould not do &s;o: he would
have more tenderne&s;s of heart.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;I
believe I &s;hould not either; but Mr. M'Queen
and I are cowards. It would not be from ten|derne&s;s
of heart; for the heart is as tender
when a man is in health as when &s;ick, though
his re&s;olution may be &s;tronger. Sixtus Quintus
was a &s;overeign as well as a prie&s;t; and, if the
criminals de&s;erved death, he was doing his duty
to the la&s;t. You would not think a judge died
ill, who &s;hould be carried off by an apoplectick
fit while pronouncing &s;entence of death. Con|&s;ider
a cla&s;s of men who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to di|&s;tribute
death:&mdash;&s;oldiers, who die &s;cattering
bullets.&mdash;Nobody thinks they die ill on that
account.&endq;</P>
<P>Talking of Biography, he &s;aid, he did not
think that the life of any literary man in Eng|land
had been well written. Be&s;ide the com|mon
<PB N="294" REF="300">
incidents of life, it &s;hould tell us his
&s;tudies, his mode of living, the means by
which he attained to excellence, and his opinion
of his own works. He told us, he had &s;ent
Derrick to Dryden's relations, to gather mate|rials
for his Life; and he believed Derrick had
got all that he him&s;elf &s;hould have got; but it
was nothing. He added, he had a kindne&s;s for
Derrick, and was &s;orry he was dead.</P>
<P>His notion as to the poems publi&s;hed by
Mr. M'Pher&s;on, as the works of O&s;&s;ian, was
not &s;haken here. Mr. M'Queen always evaded
the point of authenticity, &s;aying only that Mr.
M'Pher&s;on's pieces fell far &s;hort of tho&s;e he
knew in Er&s;e, which were &s;aid to be O&s;&s;ian's.
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;I hope they do. I am not di&s;|puting
that you may have poetry of great
merit; but that M'Pher&s;on's is not a tran&s;la|tion
from ancient poetry. You do not believe
it. I &s;ay before you, you do not believe it,
though you are very willing that the world
&s;hould believe it.&endq;&mdash;Mr. M'Queen made no
an&s;wer to this.&mdash;Dr. John&s;on proceeded &startq;I
look upon M'Pher&s;on's <HI>Fingal</HI> to be as gro&s;s an
impo&s;ition as ever the world was troubled with.
Had it been really an ancient work, a true &s;pe|cimen
how men thought at that time, it would
have been a curio&s;ity of the fir&s;t rate. As a
modern production, it is nothing.&endq;&mdash;He &s;aid,
he could never get the meaning of an <HI>Er&s;e</HI> &s;ong
<PB N="295" REF="301">
explained to him. They told him, the chorus
was generally unmeaning. &startq;I take it,&endq; &s;aid he,

<P>&startq;But &s;urely, &s;aid Mr. M'Queen, there were
words to it, which had meaning.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>

&s;hall have it:</P>

<P>I took <HI>Fingal</HI> down to the parlour in the

M'Leod, &s;on to Ulini&s;h. Mr. M'Queen
had &s;aid he had &s;ome of the poem in the origi|nal.
I de&s;ired him to mention any pa&s;&s;age in
the printed book, of which he could repeat the
original. He pointed out one in page 50 of
the quarto edition, and read the Er&s;e, while
Mr. Roderick M'Leod and I looked on the
Engli&s;h;&mdash;and Mr. M'Leod &s;aid, that it was
pretty like what Mr. M'Queen had recited.
But when Mr. M'Queen read a de&s;cription of
Cuchullin's &s;word in Er&s;e, together with a
tran&s;lation of it in Engli&s;h ver&s;e, by Sir James
Foulis, Mr. M'Leod &s;aid, that was much liker
than Mr. M'Pher&s;on's tran&s;lation of the former
pa&s;&s;age. Mr. M'Queen then repeated in Er&s;e
a de&s;cription of one of the hor&s;es in Cuchullin's
car. Mr. M'Leod &s;aid, Mr. M'Pher&s;on's Eng|li&s;h
was nothing like it.</P>

repeated a pa&s;&s;age in the original Er&s;e, which
Mr. M'Pher&s;on's tran&s;lation was pretty like;

<P>Having talked of the &s;trictne&s;s with which

hard on our friend Mr. Garrick. When I
a&s;ked him, why he did not mention him in the
Preface to his Shak&s;peare, he &s;aid, &startq;Garrick has
<PB N="299" REF="305">
been liberally paid for any thing he has done
for Shak&s;peare. If I &s;hould prai&s;e him, I
&s;hould much more prai&s;e the nation who paid
him. He has not made Shak&s;peare better
known. He cannot illu&s;trate Shak&s;peare. So
I have rea&s;ons enough again&s;t mentioning him,
were rea&s;ons nece&s;&s;ary. There &s;hould be rea|&s;ons
<HI>for</HI> it.&endq;&mdash;I &s;poke of Mrs. Montague's very
high prai&s;es of Garrick.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, it is
fit &s;he &s;hould &s;ay &s;o much, and I &s;hould &s;ay
nothing. Reynolds is fond of her book, and I
wonder at it; for neither I, nor Beauclerk,
nor Mrs. Thrale, could get through it.&endq;</P>
<P>La&s;t night Dr. John&s;on gave us an account
of the whole proce&s;s of tanning,&mdash;and of the
nature of milk, and the various operations upon
it, as making whey, &amp;c. His variety of in|formation
is &s;urpri&s;ing; and it gives one much
&s;atisfaction to find &s;uch a man be&s;towing his
attention on the u&s;eful arts of life. Ulini&s;h
was much &s;truck with his knowledge; and,
&s;aid, &startq;He is a great orator, &s;ir: it is
mu&s;ick to hear this man &s;peak.&endq;&mdash;A &s;trange
thought &s;truck me, to try if he knew any thing
of an art, or whatever it &s;hould be called,
which is no doubt very u&s;eful in life, but which
lies far out of the way of a philo&s;opher and poet;
I mean the trade of a butcher. I enticed him
into the &s;ubject, by connecting it with the va|rious
re&s;earches into the manners and cu&s;toms
<PB N="300" REF="306">
of uncivilized nations, that have been made by
our late navigators to the South Seas.&mdash;I began
with ob&s;erving, that Mr. (now Sir Jo&s;eph)
Banks tells us, that the art of &s;laughtering ani|mals
was not known in Otaheite, for, in&s;tead
of bleeding to death their dogs, (a common
food with them,) they &s;trangle them. This he
told me him&s;elf; and I &s;uppo&s;ed that their
hogs were killed in the &s;ame way. Dr. John|&s;on
&s;aid, &startq;This mu&s;t be owing to their not
having knives,&mdash;though they have &s;harp &s;tones
with which they can cut a carca&s;e in pieces
tolerably.&endq; By degrees, he &s;hewed that he knew
&s;omething even of butchery. &startq;Different ani|mals
(&s;aid he) are killed differently. An ox is
knocked down, and a calf &s;tunned; but a
&s;heep has its throat cut, without any thing being
done to &s;tupify it. The butchers have no view to
the ea&s;e of the animals, but only to make them
quiet, for their own &s;afety and convenience.
A &s;heep can give them little trouble.&mdash;Hales
is of opinion, that every animal &s;hould be
blooded, without having any blow given to it,
becau&s;e it bleeds better.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;That
would be cruel.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, &s;ir; there
is not much pain, if the jugular vein be pro|perly
cut.&endq;&mdash;Pur&s;uing the &s;ubject, he &s;aid,
the kennels of Southwark ran with blood two
or three days in the week; that he was afraid
there were &s;laughter-hou&s;es in more &s;treets in
<PB N="301" REF="307">
London than one &s;uppo&s;es; (&s;peaking with a
kind of horrour of butchering;) and, yet he
added, &startq;Any of us would kill a cow, rather
than not have beef.&endq;&mdash;I &s;aid, we <HI>could</HI> not.&mdash;
&startq;Yes, &s;aid he, any one may. The bu&s;ine&s;s of
a butcher is a trade indeed, that is to &s;ay,
there is an apprentice&s;hip &s;erved to it; but it
may be learnt in a month.&endq;</P>
<P>I mentioned a club in London, at the Boar's
Head in Ea&s;tcheap, the very tavern where
Fal&s;taff and his joyous companions met; the
members of which all a&s;&s;ume Shak&s;peare's
characters. One is Fal&s;taff, another Prince
Henry, another Bardolph, and &s;o on. <HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Don't be of it, &s;ir. Now that you have a
name, you mu&s;t be careful to avoid many
things, not bad in them&s;elves, but which will
le&s;&s;en your character<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I do not &s;ee why I might not have been of this club with|out le&s;&s;ening my character. But Dr. John&s;on's caution again&s;t &s;uppo&s;ing one's &s;elf concealed in London, may be very u&s;eful to prevent &s;ome people from doing many things, not only fooli&s;h, but criminal.</NOTE>. This every man who
has a name mu&s;t ob&s;erve. A man who is not
publickly known may live in London as he
plea&s;es, without any notice being taken of him;
but it is wonderful how a per&s;on of any con&s;e|quence
is watched. There was a member of
parliament, who wanted to prepare him&s;elf to
&s;peak on a que&s;tion that was to come on in the
Hou&s;e; and he and I were to talk it over toge|ther.
<PB N="302" REF="308">
He did not wi&s;h it &s;hould be known
that he talked with me; &s;o he would not let
me come to his hou&s;e, but came to mine.
Some time after he had made his &s;peech in the
hou&s;e, Mrs. Cholmondeley, a very airy lady,
told me, &startq;Well, you could make nothing of
him!&endq; naming the gentleman; which was a
proof that he was watched.&mdash;I had once &s;ome
bu&s;ine&s;s to do for government, and I went to
Lord North's. Precaution was taken that it
&s;hould not be known. It was dark before I
went; yet a few days after I was told, &startq;Well,
you have been with Lord North.&endq; That the
door of the prime mini&s;ter &s;hould be watched,
is not &s;trange; but that a member of parlia|ment
&s;hould be watched, or that my door
&s;hould be watched, is wonderful.&endq;</P>
<P>We &s;et out this morning, on our way to
Tali&s;ker, in Ulini&s;h's boat, having taken leave
of him and his family. Mr. Donald M'Queen
&s;till favoured us with his company, for which
we were much obliged to him. As we &s;ailed
along, Dr. John&s;on got into one of his fits of
railing at the Scots. He owned, that they had
been a very learned nation for a hundred years,
from about 1550 to about 1650; but that they
afforded the only in&s;tance of a people among
whom the arts of civil life did not advance in pro|portion
with learning; that they had hardly any
trade, any money, or any elegance, before the
<PB N="303" REF="309">
Union; that it was &s;trange that, with all the
advantages po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by other nations, they had
not any of tho&s;e conveniencies and embelli&s;h|ments
which are the fruit of indu&s;try, till they
came in contact with a civilized people. &startq;We
have taught you, &s;aid he; and we'll do the
&s;ame in time to all barbarous nations,&mdash;to the
Cherokees,&mdash;and at la&s;t to the Ouran-Outangs;&endq;
laughing with as much glee as if Monboddo
had been pre&s;ent.&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;We had wine
before the Union.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, &s;ir; you
had &s;ome weak &s;tuff, the refu&s;e of France,
which would not make you drunk.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI>
&startq;I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;ir, there was a great deal of
drunkenne&s;s.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, &s;ir; there were
people who died of drop&s;ies, which they con|tracted
in trying to get drunk.&endq;</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here glean &s;ome of his conver&s;ation at
Ulini&s;h, which I have omitted. He repeated
his remark, that a man in a &s;hip was wor&s;e
than a man in a jail. &startq;The man in a jail,
&s;aid he, has more room, better food, and
commonly better company, and is in &s;afety.&endq;
&mdash;&startq;Aye; but, &s;aid Mr. M'Queen, the man
in the &s;hip has the plea&s;ing hope of getting to
&s;hore.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, I am not talking of a
man's getting to &s;hore; but of a man while he
is in a &s;hip: and then, I &s;ay, he is wor&s;e than
a man while he is in a jail. A man in a jail
<HI>may</HI> have the &startq;<HI>plea&s;ing hope</HI>&endq; of getting out. A
<PB N="304" REF="310">
man confined for only a limited time, actually
<HI>has</HI> it.&endq;&mdash;M'Leod mentioned his &s;chemes for
carrying on fi&s;heries with &s;pirit, and that he
would wi&s;h to under&s;tand the con&s;truction of
boats. I &s;ugge&s;ted that he might go to a dock|yard
and work, as Peter the Great did.&mdash;<HI>John|&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Nay, &s;ir, he need not work. Peter the
Great had not the &s;en&s;e to &s;ee that the mere
mechanical work may be done by any body,
and that there is the &s;ame art in con&s;tructing a
ve&s;&s;el, whether the boards are well or ill
wrought. Sir Chri&s;topher Wren might as well
have &s;erved his time to a bricklayer, and fir&s;t,
indeed, to a brick-maker.&endq;</P>
<P>There is a beautiful little i&s;land in the Loch
of Dunvegan, called <HI>I&s;a.</HI> M'Leod &s;aid, he
would give it to Dr. John&s;on, on condition of
his re&s;iding on it three months in the year;
nay one month. Dr. John&s;on was highly
amu&s;ed with the fancy. I have &s;een him plea&s;e
him&s;elf with little things, even with mere
ideas like the pre&s;ent. He talked a great deal
of this i&s;land;&mdash;how he would build a hou&s;e
there,&mdash;how he would fortify it,&mdash;how he
would have cannon,&mdash;how he would plant,&mdash;how
he would &s;ally out, and <HI>take</HI> the i&s;le of
Muck;&mdash;and then he laughed with uncommon
glee, and could hardly leave off. I have &s;een
him do &s;o at a &s;mall matter that &s;truck him,
and was a &s;port to no one el&s;e. Mr. Langton
<PB N="305" REF="311">
told me, that one night he did &s;o while the
company were all grave about him:&mdash;only
Garrick, in his &s;ignificant &s;mart manner, dart|ing
his eyes around, exclaimed, &startq;<HI>Very</HI> joco&s;e,
to be &s;ure!&endq;&mdash;M'Leod encouraged the fancy
of Dr. John&s;on's becoming owner of an i&s;land;
told him, that it was the practice in this
country to name every man by his lands; and
begged leave to drink to him in that mode:
&startq;<HI>I&s;land I&s;a,</HI> your health!&endq;&mdash;Ulini&s;h, Tali&s;ker,
Mr. M'Queen, and I, all joined in our different
manners, while Dr. John&s;on bowed to each,
with much good humour.</P>
<P>We had good weather, and a fine &s;ail this
day. The &s;hore was varied with hills, and rocks,
and corn-fields, and bu&s;hes, which are here dig|nified
with the name of natural <HI>wood.</HI> We
landed near the hou&s;e of Ferneley, a farm po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
by another gentleman of the name of
M'Leod, who, expecting our arrival, was wait|ing
on the &s;hore, with a hor&s;e for Dr. John&s;on.
The re&s;t of us walked.&mdash;At dinner, I expre&s;&s;ed
to M'Leod the joy which I had in &s;eeing him
on &s;uch cordial terms with his clan. &startq;Go|vernment,
&s;aid he, has deprived us of our an|cient
power; but it cannot deprive us of our
dome&s;tick &s;atisfactions. I would rather drink
punch in one of their hou&s;es, (meaning the
hou&s;es of his people,) than be enabled, by their
hard&s;hips, to have claret in my own.&endq;&mdash;This
<PB N="306" REF="312">
&s;hould be the &s;entiment of every Chie&s;tain.
All that he can get by rai&s;ing his rents, is more
luxury in his own hou&s;e. Is it not better to
&s;hare the profits of his e&s;tate, to a certain de|gree,
with his kin&s;men, and thus have both
&s;ocial intercour&s;e and patriarchal influence?</P>
<P>We had a very good ride, for about three
miles, to Tali&s;ker, where Colonel M'Leod in|troduced
us to his lady. We found here Mr.
Donald M'Lean, the young Laird of <HI>Col,</HI>
(nephew to Tali&s;ker,) to whom I delivered the
letter with which I had been favoured by his
uncle, Profe&s;&s;or M'Leod, at Aberdeen. He
was a little lively young man. We found he
had been a good deal in England, &s;tudying
farming, and was re&s;olved to improve the value
of his father's lands, without oppre&s;&s;ing his
tenants, or lo&s;ing the ancient Highland fa&s;hions.</P>
<P>Tali&s;ker is a better place than one commonly
finds in Sky. It is &s;ituated in a rich bottom.
Before it is a wide expan&s;e of &s;ea, on each hand
of which are immen&s;e rocks; and, at &s;ome
di&s;tance in the &s;ea, there are three columnal
rocks ri&s;ing to &s;harp points. The billows
break with prodigious force and noi&s;e on the
coa&s;t of Tali&s;ker. There are here a good many
well-grown trees. Tali&s;ker is an exten&s;ive
farm. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it has, for &s;everal ge|nerations,
been the next heir to M'Leod, as
there has been but one &s;on always in that fa|mily.
<PB N="307" REF="313">
The court before the hou&s;e is mo&s;t
injudiciou&s;ly paved with the round bluei&s;h-grey
pebbles which are found upon the &s;ea-&s;hore;
&s;o that you walk as if upon cannon-balls driven
into the ground.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, I talked of the a&s;&s;iduity of the
Scotti&s;h clergy, in vi&s;iting and privately in|&s;tructing
their pari&s;hioners, and ob&s;erved how
much in this they excelled the Engli&s;h clergy.
Dr. John&s;on would not let this pa&s;s. He tried
to turn it off, by &s;aying, &startq;there are different
ways of in&s;tructing. Our clergy pray and
preach.&endq;&mdash;M'Leod and I pre&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject,
upon which he grew warm, and broke forth:
&startq;I do not believe your people are better in|&s;tructed.
If they are, it is the blind leading
the blind; for your clergy are not in&s;tructed
them&s;elves.&endq; Thinking he had gone a little
too far, he checked him&s;elf, and added, &startq;When
I talk of the ignorance of your clergy, I talk
of them as a body: I do not mean that there
are not individuals who are learned (looking at
Mr. M'Queen). I &s;uppo&s;e there are &s;uch a|mong
the clergy in Mu&s;covy. The clergy of
England have produced the mo&s;t valuable
books in &s;upport of religion, both in theory
and practice. What have your clergy done,
&s;ince you &s;unk into pre&s;byteriani&s;m? Can you
name one book of any value, on a religious
&s;ubject, written by them?&endq;&mdash;We were &s;ilent.
<PB N="308" REF="314">
&mdash;&startq;I'll help you. Forbes wrote very well;
but I believe he wrote before epi&s;copacy was
quite extingui&s;hed.&endq;&mdash;And then pau&s;ing a lit|tle,
he &s;aid, &startq;Yes, you have Wi&s;hart AGAINST
Repentance<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This was a dexterous mode of de&s;cription, for the pur|po&s;e of his argument; for what he alluded to was, a Sermon publi&s;hed by the learned Dr. William Wi&s;hart, formerly prin|cipal of the college at Edinburgh, to warm men <HI>again&s;t</HI> con|fiding in a death-bed <HI>repentance,</HI> of the inefficacy of which he entertained notions very different from tho&s;e of Dr. John&s;on.</NOTE>.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;But, &s;ir, we are not
contending for the &s;uperior learning of our
clergy, but for their &s;uperior a&s;&s;iduity.&endq;&mdash;He
bore us down again, with thundering again&s;t
their ignorance, and &s;aid to me, &startq;I &s;ee you
have not been well taught; for, you have not
charity.&endq;&mdash;He had been in &s;ome mea&s;ure forced
into this warmth, by the exulting air which I
a&s;&s;umed; for, when he began, he &s;aid, &startq;Since
you <HI>will</HI> drive the nail!&endq;&mdash;He again thought
of good Mr. M'Queen, and, taking him by
the hand, &s;aid, &startq;Sir, I did not mean any di&s;re|&s;pect
to you.&endq;</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that he conquered by
de&s;erting his ground, and not meeting the ar|gument
as I had put it. The a&s;&s;iduity of the
Scotti&s;h clergy is certainly greater than that of
the Engli&s;h. His taking up the topick of their
not having &s;o much learning, was, though in|genious,
yet a fallacy in logick. It was as if
there &s;hould be a di&s;pute whether a man's hair
<PB N="309" REF="315">
is well dre&s;&s;ed, and Dr. John&s;on &s;hould &s;ay,
&startq;Sir, his hair cannot be well dre&s;&s;ed; for he
has a dirty &s;hirt. No man who has not clean
linen, has his hair well dre&s;&s;ed.&endq;&mdash;When &s;ome
days afterwards he read this pa&s;&s;age, he &s;aid,
&startq;No, &s;ir; I did not &s;ay that a man's hair
could not be well dre&s;&s;ed becau&s;e he has not
clean linen, but becau&s;e he is bald.&endq;</P>
<P>He u&s;ed one argument again&s;t the Scotti&s;h
clergy being learned, which I doubt was not
good: &startq;As we believe a man dead till we
know that he is alive; &s;o we believe men ig|norant
till we know that they are learned.&endq;
Now our maxim in law is, to pre&s;ume a man
alive, till we know he is dead. However, in|deed,
it may be an&s;wered, that we mu&s;t fir&s;t
know he has lived; and that we have never
known the learning of the Scotti&s;h clergy.
Mr. M'Queen, though he was of opinion that
Dr. John&s;on had de&s;erted the point really in
di&s;pute, was much plea&s;ed with what he &s;aid,
and owned to me, he thought it very ju&s;t; and
Mrs. M'Leod was &s;o much captivated by his
eloquence, that &s;he told me &startq;I was a good
advocate for a bad cau&s;e.&endq;</P>

<PB N="310" REF="316">
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>24th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>This was a good day. Dr. John&s;on told us,
at breakfa&s;t, that he rode harder at a fox-chace
than any body. &startq;The Engli&s;h, &s;aid he, are
the only nation who ride hard a-hunting. A
Frenchman goes out upon a managed hor&s;e,
and capers in the field, and no more thinks of
leaping a hedge than of mounting a breach.
Lord Powi&s;court laid a wager, in France, that
he would ride a great many miles in a certain
&s;hort time. The French academicians &s;et to
work, and calculated that, from the re&s;i&s;tance
of the air, it was impo&s;&s;ible. His lord&s;hip
however performed it.&endq;</P>
<P>Our money being nearly exhau&s;ted, we &s;ent
a bill for thirty pounds, drawn on Sir William
Forbes and Co. to Lochbraccadale, but our
me&s;&s;enger found it very difficult to procure ca&s;h
for it; at length, however, he got us value from
the ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el which was to carry away
&s;ome emigrants. There is a great &s;carcity of &s;pe|cie
in Sky. Mr. M'Queen &s;aid, he had the utmo&s;t
difficulty to pay his &s;ervants wages, or to pay
for any little thing which he has to buy. The
rents are paid in bills, which the drovers give.
The people con&s;ume a va&s;t deal of &s;nuff and
tobacco, for which they mu&s;t pay ready money;
and pedlars, who come about &s;elling goods, as
there is not a &s;hop in the i&s;land, carry away the
<PB N="311" REF="317">
ca&s;h. If there were encouragement given to
fi&s;heries and manufactures, there might be a
circulation of money introduced. I got one-and-twenty
&s;hillings in &s;ilver at Portree, which
was thought a wonderful &s;tore.</P>
<P>Tali&s;ker, Mr. M'Queen, and I, walked out,
and looked at no le&s;s than fifteen different
water-falls near the hou&s;e, in the &s;pace of about
a quarter of a mile. We al&s;o &s;aw Cuchullin's
well, &s;aid to have been the favourite &s;pring of
that ancient hero. I drank of it. The water
is admirable. On the &s;hore are many &s;tones
full of chry&s;tallizations in the heart.</P>
<P>Though our obliging friend, Mr. M'Lean,
was but the young laird, he had the title of <HI>Col</HI>
con&s;tantly given him. After dinner, he and I
walked to the top of Prie&s;hwell, a very high
rocky hill, from whence there is a view of
Ba$ra,&mdash;the Long I&s;land,&mdash;Bernera,&mdash;the Loch
of Dunvegan,&mdash;part of Rum,&mdash;part of Ra&s;ay,
and a va&s;t deal of the I&s;le of Sky. Col, though
he had come into Sky with intention to be at
Dunvegan, and pa&s;s a con&s;iderable time in the
i&s;land, mo&s;t politely re&s;olved fir&s;t to conduct us
to Mull, and then to return to Sky. This was
a very fortunate circum&s;tance; for he planned
an expedition for us of more variety than
merely going to Mull. He propo&s;ed we &s;hould
&s;ee the i&s;lands of <HI>Egg, Muck, Col,</HI> and <HI>Tyr-yi.</HI>
In all of the&s;e i&s;lands he could &s;hew us every
<PB N="312" REF="318">
thing worth &s;eeing; and in Mull he &s;aid he
&s;hould be as if at home, his father having lands
there, and he a farm.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on did not talk much to-day, but
&s;eemed intent in li&s;tening to the &s;chemes of fu|ture
excur&s;ion, planned by <HI>Col.</HI> Dr. Birch,
however, being mentioned, he &s;aid, he had
more anecdotes than any man. I &s;aid, Percy
had a great many; that he flowed with them,
like one of the brooks here.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;If
Percy is like one of the brooks here, Brich was
like the river Thames. Birch excelled Percy
in that, as much as Percy excels Gold&s;mith.&endq;
&mdash;I mentioned Lord Hailes as a man of anec|dote.
He was not plea&s;ed with him, for pub|li&s;hing
only &s;uch memorials and letters as were
unfavourable for the Stuart family. &startq;If, &s;aid
he, a man fairly warns you, &startq;I am to give all
the ill; do you find the good;&endq; he may: but if
the object which he profe&s;&s;es be to give a view
of a reign, let him tell all the truth. I would

<P>It was re&s;olved that we &s;hould &s;et out, in
order to return to Slate, to be in readine&s;s to
take boat whenever there &s;hould be fair wind.
Dr. John&s;on remained in his chamber writing
a letter, and it was long before we could get
him into motion. He did not come to break|fa&s;t,
but had it &s;ent to him. When he had
fini&s;hed his letter, it was twelve o'clock, and
we &s;hould have &s;et out at ten. When I went
up to him, he &s;aid to me, &startq;Do you remember
a &s;ong which begins&endq;
<Q><L>&startq;Ev'ry i&s;land is a pri&s;on</L>
<L>Strongly guarded by the &s;ea;</L>
<L>Kings and princes, for that rea&s;on,</L>
<L>Pris'ners are, as well as we.&endq;</L></Q>
I &s;uppo&s;e he had been thinking of our confined
&s;ituation. He would fain have gone in a boat
from hence, in&s;tead of riding back to Slate.
A &s;cheme for it was propo&s;ed. He &s;aid,
&startq;We'll not be driven tamely from it:&endq;&mdash;but
it proved impracticable.</P>
<P>We took leave of M'Leod and Tali&s;ker,
from whom we parted with regret. Tali&s;ker,
having been bred to phy&s;ick, had a tincture of
&s;cholar&s;hip in his conver&s;ation, which plea&s;ed
Dr. John&s;on, and he had &s;ome very good books;
and being a colonel in the Dutch &s;ervice, he
and his lady, in con&s;equence of having lived
<PB N="314" REF="320">
abroad, had introduced the ea&s;e and politene&s;s
of the continent into this rude region.</P>
<P>Young <HI>Col</HI> was now our leader. Mr.
M'Queen was to accompany us half a day
more. We &s;topped at a little hut, where we
&s;aw an old woman grinding with the <HI>quern,</HI> the
ancient Highland in&s;trument, which it is &s;aid
was u&s;ed by the Romans, but which, being
very &s;low in its operation, is almo&s;t entirely
gone into di&s;u&s;e.</P>
<P>The walls of the cottages in Sky, in&s;tead of
being one compacted ma&s;s of &s;tones, are often
formed by two exterior &s;urfaces of &s;tone, filled
up with earth in the middle, which makes
them very warm. The roof is generally bad.
They are thatched, &s;ometimes with &s;traw, &s;ome|times
with heath, &s;ometimes with ferns. The
thatch is &s;ecured by ropes of &s;traw, or of health;
and, to fix the ropes, there is a &s;tone tied to the
end of each. The&s;e &s;tones hang round the
bottom of the roof, and make it look like a
lady's hair in papers; but I &s;hould think that,
when there is wind, they would come down,
and knock people on the head.</P>
<P>We dined at the inn at Scon&s;er, where I had
the plea&s;ure to find a letter from my wife.
Here we parted from our learned companion,
Mr. Donald M'Queen. Dr. John&s;on took
leave of him very affectionately, &s;aying, &startq;Dear
&s;ir, do not forget me!&endq;&mdash;We &s;ettled, that he
<PB N="315" REF="321">
&s;hould write an account of the I&s;le of Sky,
which Dr. John&s;on promi&s;ed to revi&s;e. He
&s;aid, Mr. M'Queen &s;hould tell all that he
could; di&s;tingui&s;hing what he him&s;elf knew,
what was traditional, and what conjectural.</P>
<P>We &s;ent our hor&s;es round a point of land,
that we might &s;hun &s;ome very bad road; and
re&s;olved to go forward by &s;ea. It was &s;even
o'clock when we got into our boat. We had
many &s;howers, and it &s;oon grew pretty dark.
Dr. John&s;on &s;at &s;ilent and patient. Once he
&s;aid, as he looked on the black coa&s;t of Sky,&mdash;
black, as being compo&s;ed of rocks &s;een in the
du&s;k,&mdash;&startq;This is very &s;olemn.&endq; Our boatmen
were rude &s;ingers, and &s;eemed &s;o like wild
Indians,. that a very little imagination was
nece&s;&s;ary to give one an impre&s;&s;ion of being
upon an American river. We landed at <HI>Stro|limus,</HI>
from whence we got a guide to walk be|fore
us, for two miles, to <HI>Corrichatachin.</HI> Not
being able to procure a hor&s;e for our baggage,
I took one portmanteau before me, and Jo&s;eph
another. We had but a &s;ingle &s;tar to light us
on our way. It was about eleven when we
arrived. We were mo&s;t ho&s;pitably received
by the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, who were ju&s;t go|ing
to bed, but, with unaffected ready kindne&s;s,
made a good fire, and at twelve o'clock at
night had &s;upper on the table.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="322">
James Macdonald, of <HI>Knockow,</HI> King&s;burgh's
brother, whom we had &s;een at King&s;burgh, was
there. He &s;hewed me a bond granted by the
late Sir James Macdonald, to old King&s;burgh,
the preamble of which does &s;o much honour to
the feelings of that much-lamented gentleman,
that I thought it worth tran&s;cribing. It was
as follows:</P>
<P>&startq;I, Sir James Macdonald, of Macdonald,
Baronet, now, after arriving at my perfect age,
from the friend&s;hip I bear to Alexander Mac|donald
of King&s;burgh, and in return for the
long and faithful &s;ervices done and performed
by him to my decea&s;ed father, and to my&s;elf
during my minority, when he was one of my
Tutors and Curators; being re&s;olved, now
that the &s;aid Alexander Macdonald is advanced
in years, to contribute my endeavours for
making his old age placid and comfortable&endq;&mdash;
therefore he grants him an annuity of fifty
pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on went to bed &s;oon. When one
bowl of punch was fini&s;hed, I ro&s;e, and was
near the door, in my way up &s;tairs to bed; but
Corrichatachin &s;aid, it was the fir&s;t time <HI>Col</HI>
had been in his hou&s;e, and he &s;hould have his
bowl;&mdash;and would not I join in drinking it?
The heartine&s;s of my hone&s;t landlord, and the
<PB N="317" REF="323">
de&s;ire of doing &s;ocial honour to our very ob|liging
conductor, induced me to &s;it down again.
<HI>Col's</HI> bowl was fini&s;hed; and by that time we
were well warmed. A third bowl was &s;oon
made, and that too was fini&s;hed. We were
cordial, and merry to a high degree; but of
what pa&s;&s;ed I have no recollection, with any
accuracy. I remember calling <HI>Corrichatachin</HI>
by the familiar appellation of <HI>Corri,</HI> which his
friends do. A fourth bowl was made, by
which time <HI>Col,</HI> and young M'Kinnon, Corri|chatachin's
&s;on, &s;lipped away to bed. I con|tinued
a little with <HI>Corri</HI> and <HI>Knockow;</HI> but at
la&s;t I left them. It was near five in the morn|ing
when I got to bed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>26th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I awaked at noon, with a &s;evere head-ach.
I was much vexed that I &s;hould have been
guilty of &s;uch a riot, and afraid of a reproof
from Dr. John&s;on. I thought it very in|con&s;i&s;tent
with that conduct which I ought to
maintain, while the companion of the <HI>Rambler.</HI>
About one he came into my room, and ac|co&s;ted
me, &startq;What, drunk yet!&endq;&mdash;His tone
of voice was not that of &s;evere upbraiding; &s;o
I was relieved a little.&mdash;&startq;Sir, &s;aid I, they
kept me up.&endq;&mdash;He an&s;wered, &startq;No, you kept
them up, you drunken dog.&endq;&mdash;This he &s;aid
with good-humoured <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> plea&s;antry. Soon
<PB N="318" REF="324">
afterwards, Corrichatachin, Col, and other
friends, a&s;&s;embled round my bed. <HI>Corri</HI> had a
brandy-bottle and gla&s;s with him, and in&s;i&s;ted
I &s;hould take a dram.&mdash;&startq;Aye, &s;aid Dr. John|&s;on,
fill him drunk again. Do it in the morn|ing
that we may laugh at him all day. It is a
poor thing for a fellow to get drunk at night,
and &s;culk to bed, and let his friends have no
&s;port.&endq;&mdash;Finding him thus jocular, I became
quite ea&s;y; and when I offered to get up, he
very good-naturedly &s;aid, &startq;You need be in
no &s;uch hurry now.&endq;&mdash;I took my ho&s;t's advice,
and drank &s;ome brandy, which I found an
effectual cure for my head-ach. When I ro&s;e,
I went into Dr. John&s;on's room, and taking up
Mrs. M'Kinnon's Prayer-book, I opened it at
the twentieth Sunday after Trinity, in the
epi&s;tle for which I read, &startq;And be not drunk
with wine, wherein there is exce&s;s.&endq; Some
would have taken this as a divine interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Mrs. M'Kinnon told us at dinner, that old
King&s;burgh, her father, was examined at Mug|&s;tot,
by General Campbell, as to the particu|lars
of the dre&s;s of the per&s;on who had come to
his hou&s;e in woman's clothes, along with Mi&s;s
Flora M^cDonald; as by this time the General
had intelligence of that di&s;gui&s;e. The parti|culars
were taken down in writing, that it
might be &s;een how far they agreed with the
dre&s;s of the <HI>Iri&s;h girl</HI> who went with Mi&s;s
<PB N="319" REF="325">
Flora from the Long I&s;land. King&s;burgh,
&s;he &s;aid, had but one &s;ong, which he always
&s;ung when he was merry over a gla&s;s. She
dictated the words to me, which are fooli&s;h
enough:</P>
<LG>
<L>Green &s;leeves and pudding pies,</L>
<L>Tell me where my mi&s;tre&s;s lies,</L>
<L>And I'll be with her before &s;he ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Fiddle and aw' together.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>May our affairs abroad &s;ucceed,</L>
<L>And may our king come home with &s;peed,</L>
<L>And all pretenders &s;hake for dread,</L>
<L>And let <HI>his</HI> health go round.</L>

<L>Green &s;leeves, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P>While the examination was going on, this
Tali&s;ker, who was there as one of M'Leod's
militia, could not re&s;i&s;t the plea&s;antry of a&s;king
King&s;burgh in allu&s;ion to his only &s;ong, &startq;Had
&s;he <HI>green &s;leeves?</HI>&endq; King&s;burgh gave him no
an&s;wer. Lady Margaret M^cDonald was very
angry at Tali&s;ker for joking on &s;uch a &s;erious
occa&s;ion, as King&s;burgh was really in danger
of his life.&mdash;Mrs. M'Kinnon added that Lady
Margaret was quite adored in Sky. That when
&s;he rode through the i&s;land, the people ran in
crowds before her, and took the &s;tones off the
road, le&s;t her hor&s;e &s;hould &s;tumble and &s;he be
<PB N="320" REF="326">
hurt. Her hu&s;band, Sir Alexander, is al&s;o re|membered
with great regard. We were told
that every week a hog&s;head of claret was drunk
at his table.</P>
<P>This was another day of wind and rain; but
good cheer and good &s;ociety helped to beguile
the time. I felt my&s;elf comfortable enough in
the afternoon. I then thought that my la&s;t
night's riot was no more than &s;uch a &s;ocial ex|ce&s;s
as may happen without much moral blame;
and recollected that &s;ome phy&s;icians main|tained,
that a fever produced by it was, upon
the whole, good for health: &s;o different are
our reflections on the &s;ame &s;ubject, at different
periods; and &s;uch the excu&s;es with which we
palliate what we know to be wrong.</P>

<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>27th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. Donald M'Leod, our original guide,
who had parted from us at Dunvegan, joined
us again to-day. The weather was &s;till &s;o bad
that we could not travel. I found a clo&s;et
here, with a good many books, be&s;ide tho&s;e
that were lying about. Dr. John&s;on told me,
he found a library in his room at Tali&s;ker; and
ob&s;erved, that it was one of the remarkable
things of Sky, that there were &s;o many books
in it.</P>
<P>Though we had here great abundance of
provi&s;ions, it is remarkable that Corrichatichin
has literally no garden: not even a turnip, a
<PB N="321" REF="327">
carrot or a cabbage.&mdash;After dinner, we talked
of the crooked &s;pade u&s;ed in Sky, already de|&s;cribed,
and they maintained that it was better
than the u&s;ual garden-&s;pade, and that there was
an art in to&s;&s;ing it, by which tho&s;e who were
accu&s;tomed to it could work very ea&s;ily with it.
&mdash;&startq;Nay, &s;aid Dr. John&s;on, it may be u&s;eful in
land where there are many &s;tones to rai&s;e; but
it certainly is not a good in&s;trument for dig|ging
good land. A man may to&s;s it, to be
&s;ure; but he will to&s;s a light &s;pade much better:
its weight makes it an incumbrance. A man
<HI>may</HI> dig any land with it; but he has no occa|&s;ion
for &s;uch a weight in digging good land.
You may take a field-piece to &s;hoot &s;parrows;
but all the &s;parrows you can bring home will
not be worth the charge.&endq;&mdash;He was quite &s;o|cial
and ea&s;y among&s;t them; and, though he
drank no fermented liquor, toa&s;ted Highland
beauties with great readine&s;s. His conviviality
engaged them &s;o much, that they &s;eemed eager
to &s;hew their attention to him, and vied with
each other in crying out, with a &s;trong Celtick
pronunciation, &startq;Toctor Shon&s;on, Toctor
Shon&s;on, your health!&endq;</P>
<P>This evening one of our married ladies, a
lively pretty little woman, good-humouredly
&s;at down upon Dr. John&s;on's knee, and, being
encouraged by &s;ome of the company, put her
hands round his neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him.&mdash;&startq;Do
<PB N="322" REF="328">
it again, &s;aid he; and let us &s;ee who will tire
fir&s;t.&endq;&mdash;He kept her on his knee &s;ome time,
while he and &s;he drank tea. He was now like a
<HI>buck</HI> indeed. All the company were much en|tertained
to find him &s;o ea&s;y and plea&s;ant. To
me it was highly comick, to &s;ee the grave
philo&s;opher,&mdash;the Rambler,&mdash;toying with a
Highland beauty!&mdash;But what could he do? He
mu&s;t have been &s;urly, and weak too, had he not
behaved as he did. He would have been
laughed at, and not more re&s;pected, though
le&s;s loved.</P>
<P>He read to-night, to him&s;elf, as he &s;at in
company, a great deal of my Journal, and &s;aid
to me, &startq;The more I read of this, I think the
more highly of you.&endq;&mdash;The gentlemen &s;at a
long time at their punch, after he and I had
retired to our chambers. The manner in which
they were attended &s;truck me as &s;ingular:&mdash;
The bell being broken, a &s;mart lad lay on a
table in the corner of the room, ready to &s;pring
up and bring the kettle, whenever it was
wanted. They continued drinking, and &s;ing|ing
Er&s;e &s;ongs, till near five in the morning,
when they all came into my room, where &s;ome
of them had beds. Unluckily for me, they
found a bottle of punch in a corner, which they
drank; and Corrichatachin went for another,
which they al&s;o drank. They made many apolo|gies
for di&s;turbing me. I told them, that, having
<PB N="323" REF="329">
been kept awake by their mirth, I had once
thoughts of getting up, and joining them again.
Hone&s;t Corrichatachin &s;aid, &startq;To have had
you done &s;o, I would have given a cow.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>Tue&s;day, <DATE>28th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The weather was wor&s;e than ye&s;terday. I
felt as if impri&s;oned. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, it was
irk&s;ome to be detained thus: yet he &s;eemed to
have le&s;s unea&s;ine&s;s, or more patience, than I
had. What made our &s;ituation wor&s;e here
was, that we had no rooms that we could
command; for the good people had no notion
that a man could have any occa&s;ion but for a
mere &s;leeping-place; &s;o, during the day, the
bed-rooms were common to all the hou&s;e.
Servants eat in Dr. John&s;on's; and mine was a
kind of general rendezvous of all under the
roof, children and dogs not excepted. As the
gentlemen occupied the parlour, the ladies had
no place to &s;it in, during the day, but Dr. John|&s;on's
room. I had always &s;ome quiet time for
writing in it, before he was up; and, by degrees,
I accu&s;tomed the ladies to let me &s;it in it after
breakfa&s;t, at my Journal, without minding me.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on was this morning for going to
&s;ee as many i&s;lands as we could; not recollecting
the uncertainty of the &s;ea&s;on, which might de|tain
us in one place for many weeks. He &s;aid
to me, &startq;I have more the &s;pirit of adventure
<PB N="324" REF="330">
than you.&endq;&mdash;For my part, I was anxious to get
to Mull, from whence we might almo&s;t any day
reach the main land.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on mentioned, that the few ancient
Iri&s;h gentlemen yet remaining have the highe&s;t
pride of family; that Mr. Sandford, a friend of
his, who&s;e mother was Iri&s;h, told him, that
O'Hara (who was true Iri&s;h, both by father
and mother) and he, and Mr. Pon&s;onby, &s;on to
the Earl of Be&s;borough, the greate&s;t man of the
three, but of an Engli&s;h family, went to &s;ee
one of tho&s;e ancient Iri&s;h, and that he di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
them thus: &startq;O'Hara, you are wel|come!
Mr. Sandford, your mother's &s;on, is
welcome! Mr. Pon&s;onby, you may &s;it down.&endq;</P>
<P>He talked both of thre&s;hing and thatching.
He &s;aid, it was very difficult to determine how
to agree with a thatcher. &startq;If you pay him by
the day's wages, he will thre&s;h no more than he
plea&s;es; though, to be &s;ure, the negligence of
a thre&s;her is more ea&s;ily detected than that of
mo&s;t labourers, becau&s;e he mu&s;t always make a
&s;ound while he works. If you pay him by the
piece, by the quantity of grain which he pro|duces,
he will thre&s;h only while the grain comes
freely, and, though he leaves a good deal in the
ear, it is not worth while to thre&s;h the &s;traw
over again; nor can you fix him to do it &s;uf|ficiently,
becau&s;e it is &s;o difficult to prove how
much le&s;s a man thre&s;hes than he ought to do.&endq;
<PB N="325" REF="331">
&startq;Here then is a dilemma: but, for my part, I
would engage him by the day; I would rather
tru&s;t his idlene&s;s than his fraud.&endq; He &s;aid, a
roof thatched with Lincoln&s;hire reeds would
la&s;t &s;eventy years, as he was informed when in
that county; and that he told this to a great
thatcher in London, who &s;aid, he believed it
might be true.&mdash;Such are the pains that Dr.
John&s;on takes to get the be&s;t information on
every &s;ubject.</P>
<P>He proceeded: &startq;It is difficult for a farmer
in England to find day-labourers, becau&s;e the
lowe&s;t manufacturers can always get more than
a day-labourer. It is of no con&s;equence how
high the wages of manufacturers are; but it
would be of very bad con&s;equence to rai&s;e the
wages of tho&s;e who procure the immediate ne|ce&s;&s;aries
of life, for that would rai&s;e the price
of provi&s;ions. Here then is a problem for po|liticians.
It is not rea&s;onable that the mo&s;t
u&s;eful body of men &s;hould be the wor&s;t paid;
yet it does not appear how it can be ordered
otherwi&s;e. It were to be wi&s;hed, that a mode
for its being otherwi&s;e were found our. In the
mean time, it is better to give temporary a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
by charitable contributions to poor la|bourers,
at times when provi&s;ions are high,
than to rai&s;e their wages; becau&s;e, if wages
are once rai&s;ed, they will never get down
again.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="332">
Happily the weather cleared up between one
and two o'clock, and we got ready to depart;
but our kind ho&s;t and ho&s;te&s;s would not let us
go without taking a <HI>&s;natch,</HI> as they called it;
which was in truth a very good dinner. While
the punch went round, Dr. John&s;on kept a
clo&s;e whi&s;pering conference with Mrs. M'Kin|non,
which, however, was loud enough to let
us hear that the &s;ubject of it was the particulars
of Prince Charles's e&s;cape. The company
were entertained and plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve it.
Upon that &s;ubject, there was &s;omething con|genial
between the &s;oul of Dr. Samuel John&s;on
and that of an i&s;le of Sky farmer's wife. It is
curious to &s;ee people, how far &s;o ever removed
from each other in the general &s;y&s;tem of their
lives, come clo&s;e together on a particular point
which is common to each. We were merry
with Corrichatachin, on Dr. John&s;on's whi&s;|pering
with his wife. She, perceiving this,
humourou&s;ly cried, &startq;I am in love with him.
What is it to live and not to love?&endq; Upon her
&s;aying &s;omething, which I did not hear, or
cannot recollect, he &s;eized her hand eagerly,
and ki&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>As we were going, the Scotti&s;h phra&s;e of
&startq;<HI>hone&s;t man!</HI>&endq; which is an expre&s;&s;ion of kindne&s;s
and regard, was often and often applied by the
company to Dr. John&s;on. I was al&s;o treated
with much civility; and I mu&s;t take &s;ome
<PB N="327" REF="333">
merit from my a&s;&s;iduous attention to him,
and from my contriving that he &s;hall be ea&s;y
wherever he goes, that he &s;hall not be a&s;ked
twice to eat or drink any thing, (which always
di&s;gu&s;ts him,) that he &s;hall be provided with
water at his meals, and many &s;uch little things,
which, if not attended to, would fret him. I
al&s;o may be allowed to claim &s;ome merit in
leading the conver&s;ation; I do not mean lead|ing,
as in an orche&s;tra, by playing the fir&s;t
fiddle; but leading as one does in examining a
witne&s;s,&mdash;&s;tarting topicks, and making him
pur&s;ue them. He appears to me like a great
mill, into which a &s;ubject is thrown to be
ground. It requires, indeed, fertile minds to
furni&s;h materials for this mill. I regret when|ever
I &s;ee it unemployed; but &s;ometimes I feel
my&s;elf quite barren, and have nothing to
throw in.&mdash;I know not if this mill be a good
figure; though Pope makes his mind a mill for
turning ver&s;es.</P>
<P>We &s;et out about four. Young Corrichata|chin
went with us. We had a fine evening,
and arrived in good time at <HI>O&s;tig,</HI> the re&s;idence
of Mr. Martin M'Pher&s;on, mini&s;ter of Slate.
It is a pretty good hou&s;e, built by his father,
upon a farm near the church. We were
received here with much kindne&s;s by
Mr. and Mrs. M'Pher&s;on, and his &s;i&s;ter,
Mi&s;s M'Pher&s;on, who plea&s;ed Dr. John&s;on
<PB N="328" REF="334">
much, by &s;inging Er&s;e &s;ongs, and playing on
the guittar. He afterwards &s;ent her a pre&s;ent
of his <HI>Ra&s;&s;elas.</HI> In his bedchamber was a
pre&s;s &s;tored with books, Greek, Latin, French
and Engli&s;h, mo&s;t of which had belonged to
the father of our ho&s;t, the learned Dr. M'Pher|&s;on;
who, though his <HI>Di&s;&s;ertations</HI> have been
mentioned in a former page as un&s;atisfactory,
was a man of di&s;tingui&s;hed talents. Dr. John|&s;on
looked at a Latin paraphra&s;e of the &s;ong of
Mo&s;es, written by him, and publi&s;hed in the
<HI>Scots Magazine</HI> for 1747, and &s;aid, &startq;It does
him honour; he has a great deal of Latin, and
good Latin.&endq;&mdash;Dr. M'Pher&s;on publi&s;hed al&s;o in
the &s;ame magazine, June 1739, an original
Latin ode, which he wrote from the i&s;le of
Barra, where he was mini&s;ter for &s;ome years.
It is very poetical, and exhibits a &s;triking proof
how much all things depend upon compari&s;on:
for Barra, it &s;eems, appeared to him &s;o much
wor&s;e than Sky, his <HI>natale &s;olum,</HI> that he lan|gui&s;hed
for its &startq;ble&s;&s;ed mountains,&endq; and
thought him&s;elf buried alive among&s;t barba|rians
where he was.&mdash;My readers will probably
not be di&s;plea&s;ed to have a &s;pecimen of this
ode:
<Q><L>&startq;Hei mihi! quantos patior dolores,</L>
<L>Dum procul &s;pecto juga ter beata;</L>
<L>Dum ferae Barrae &s;teriles arenas</L>
<L>Solus oberro.&endq;</L>

<P>After wi&s;hing for wings to fly over to his
dear country, which was in his view, from what
he calls <HI>Thule,</HI> as being the mo&s;t we&s;tern i&s;le of
Scotland, except St. Kilda; after de&s;cribing
the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, and the mi&s;eries of
&s;olitude, he at la&s;t, with becoming propriety,
has recour&s;e to the only &s;ure relief of thinking
men,&mdash;<HI>Sur&s;um corda,</HI>&mdash;the hope of a better
world, and di&s;po&s;es his mind to re&s;ignation:

<HEAD>Wedne&s;day, <DATE>29th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>After a very good &s;leep, I ro&s;e more refre&s;hed
than I had been for &s;ome nights. We were
now at but a little di&s;tance from the &s;hore, and
&s;aw the &s;ea from our windows, which made our
voyage &s;eem nearer. Mr. M'Pher&s;on's man|ners
<PB N="330" REF="336">
and addre&s;s plea&s;ed us much. He ap|peared
to be a man of &s;uch intelligence and
ta&s;te as to be &s;en&s;ible of the extraordinary
powers of his illu&s;trious gue&s;t. He &s;aid to me,
&startq;Dr. John&s;on is an honour to mankind; and,
if the expre&s;&s;ion may be u&s;ed, is an honour to
religion.&endq;</P>
<P>Col, who had gone ye&s;terday to pay a vi&s;it at
Camu&s;cro&s;s, joined us this morning at break|fa&s;t.
Some other gentlemen al&s;o came to enjoy
the entertainment of Dr. John&s;on's conver&s;ation.
&mdash;The day was windy and rainy, &s;o that we
had ju&s;t &s;eized a happy interval for our journey
la&s;t night. We had good entertainment here,
better accommodation than at Corrichatachin,
and time enough to our&s;elves. The hours &s;lipped
along imperceptibly. We talked of Shen&s;tone.
Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, he was a good layer-out of
land, but would not allow him to approach
excellence as a poet. He &s;aid, he believed he
had tried to read all his Love Pa&s;torals, but
did not get through them. I repeated the
&s;tanza,
<Q><L>She gazed as I &s;lowly withdrew;</L>
<L>My path I could hardly di&s;crn;</L>
<L>So &s;weetly &s;he bade me adieu,</L>
<L>I thought that &s;he bade me return.</L></Q>
He &s;aid, &startq;that &s;eems to be pretty.&endq; I ob|&s;erved
that Shen&s;tone, from his &s;hort maxims
in pro&s;e, appeared to have &s;ome power of
<PB N="331" REF="337">
thinking; but Dr. John&s;on would not allow
him that merit. He agreed, however, with
Shen&s;tone, that it was wrong in the brother of
one of his corre&s;pondents to burn his letters;
&startq;for, &s;aid he, Shen&s;tone was a man who&s;e cor|re&s;pondence
was an honour.&endq;&mdash;He was this af|ternoon
full of critical &s;everity, and dealt about
his cen&s;ures on all &s;ides. He &s;aid, Hammond's
Love Elegies were poor things. He &s;poke
contemptuou&s;ly of our lively and elegant,
though too licentious, Lyrick bard, Hanbury
Williams, and &s;aid, &startq;he had no fame, but
from boys who drank with him.&endq;</P>
<P>While he was in this mood, I was unfortu|nate
enough, &s;imply perhaps, but I could not
help thinking, unde&s;ervedly, to come within
&startq;the whiff and wind of his fell &s;word.&endq; I a&s;ked
him, if he had never been accu&s;tomed to wear
a night-cap. He &s;aid, &startq;No.&endq; I a&s;ked, if it
was be&s;t not to wear one.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, I
had this cu&s;tom by chance; and perhaps no
man &s;hall ever know whether it is be&s;t to &s;leep
with or without a night-cap.&endq;&mdash;Soon after|wards
he was laughing at &s;ome deficiency in
the Highlands, and &s;aid, &startq;One might as well
go without &s;hoes and &s;tockings.&endq;&mdash;Thinking
to have a little hit at his own deficiency, I
ventured to add,&mdash;&startq;or without a night cap,
&s;ir.&endq; But I had better have been &s;ilent; for
he retorted directly. &startq;I do not &s;ee the
<PB N="332" REF="338">
connection there (laughing). Nobody before
was ever fooli&s;h enough to a&s;k whether it was
be&s;t to wear a night-cap or not. This comes
of being a little wrong-headed.&endq;&mdash;He carried
the company along with him: and yet the
truth is, that if he had always worn a night-cap,
as is the common practice, and found the
Highlanders did not wear one, he would have
wondered at their barbarity; &s;o that my hit was
fair enough.</P>

<HEAD>Thur&s;day, <DATE>30th September.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>There was as great a &s;torm of wind and rain
as I have almo&s;t ever &s;een, which nece&s;&s;arily
confined us to the hou&s;e; but we were fully
compen&s;ated by Dr. John&s;on's conver&s;ation.
He &s;aid, he did not grudge Burke's being the
fir&s;t man in the Hou&s;e of Commons; for he
was the fir&s;t man every where; but he grudged
that a fellow who makes no figure in company,
and has a mind as narrow as the neck of a vi|negar
cruet, &s;hould make a figure in the Hou&s;e
of Commons, merely by having the knowledge
of a few forms, and being furni&s;hed with a
little occa&s;ional information<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">He did not mention the name of any particular per&s;on; but tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant with the political world will probably recollect more per&s;ons than one to whom this ob&s;er|vation may be applied.</NOTE>. He told us,
the fir&s;t time he &s;aw Dr. Young was at the
<PB N="333" REF="339">
hou&s;e of Mr. Richard&s;on, the author of <HI>Cla|ri&s;&s;a.</HI>
He was &s;ent for, that the doctor might
read to him his <HI>Conjectures on Original Compo&s;i|tion,</HI>
which he did, and Dr. John&s;on made his
remarks; and he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find Young
receive as novelties what he thought very com|mon
maxims. He &s;aid he believed Young
was not a great &s;cholar, nor had &s;tudied regu|larly
the art of writing; that there were very
fine things in his <HI>Night Thoughts,</HI> though you
could not find twenty lines together without
&s;ome extravagance. He repeated two pa&s;&s;ages
from his <HI>Love of Fame,</HI>&mdash;the characters of
Brunetta and Stella, which he prai&s;ed highly.
He &s;aid Young pre&s;&s;ed him much to come to
Wellwyn. He always intended it; but never
went. He was &s;orry when Young died. The
cau&s;e of quarrel between Young and his &s;on,
he told us, was, that his &s;on in&s;i&s;ted Young
&s;hould turn away a clergyman's widow, who
lived with him, and who, having acquired
great influence over the father, was &s;aucy to
the &s;on. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &s;he could not
conceal her re&s;entment at him, for &s;aying to
Young, that &startq;an old man &s;hould not re&s;ign
him&s;elf to the management of any body.&endq;&mdash;I
a&s;ked him, if there was any improper con|nection
between them.&mdash;&startq;No, &s;ir, no more
than between two &s;tatues.&mdash;He was pa&s;t four|&s;core,
and &s;he a very coar&s;e woman. She read
<PB N="334" REF="340">
to him, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, made his coffee, and
frothed his chocolate, and did &s;uch things as an
old man wi&s;hes to have done for him.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Dodridge being mentioned, he ob&s;erved
that &startq;he was authour of one of the fine&s;t
epigrams in the Engli&s;h language. It is in
Orton's Life of him. The &s;ubject is his fa|mily-motto,
&mdash;<HI>Dum vivimus, vivamus;</HI> which, in
its primary &s;ignification, is, to be &s;ure, not
very &s;uitable to a chri&s;tian divine; but he pa|raphra&s;ed
it thus:&endq;</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Live, while you live, the <HI>epicure</HI> would &s;ay,</L>
<L>And &s;eize the plea&s;ures of the pre&s;ent day.</L>
<L>Live, while you live, the &s;acred <HI>preacher</HI> cries,</L>
<L>And give to GOD each moment as it flies.</L>
<L>Lord, in my views let both united be;</L>
<L>I live in <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> when I live to <HI>thee.</HI>&endq;</L></Q>
<P>I a&s;ked, if it was not &s;trange that government
&s;hould permit &s;o many infidel writings to pa&s;s
without cen&s;ure.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, it is mighty
fooli&s;h. It is for want of knowing their own
power. The pre&s;ent family on the throne
came to the crown again&s;t the will of nine
tenths of the people. Whether the&s;e nine
tenths were right or wrong, it is not our bu&s;i|ne&s;s
now to inquire. But &s;uch being the &s;itua|tion
of the Royal Family, they were glad to
encourage all who would be their friends.
Now you know every bad man is a Whig;
every man who has loo&s;e notions. The church
was all again&s;t this family. They, were as I
<PB N="335" REF="341">
&s;ay, glad to encourage any friends; and there|fore,
&s;ince their acce&s;&s;ion, there is no in&s;tance
of any man being kept back on account of his
bad principles; and hence this inundation of
impiety.&endq; I ob&s;erved that Mr. Hume, &s;ome of
who&s;e writings were very unfavourable to reli|gion,
was however a Tory.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir,
Hume is a Tory by chance, as being a Scotch|man;
but not upon a principle of duty; for
he has no principle. If he is any thing, he is
a Hobbi&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>There was &s;omething not quite &s;erene in his
humour to-night, after &s;upper; for he &s;poke
of ha&s;tening away to London, without &s;topping
much at Edinburgh. I reminded him, that he
had General Oughton and many others to &s;ee.
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Nay, I &s;hall neither go in je&s;t,
nor &s;tay in je&s;t. I &s;hall do what is fit.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;|well.</HI>
&startq;Aye, &s;ir; but all I de&s;ire is, that you
will let me tell you when it is fit.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Sir, I &s;hall not con&s;ult you.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;If
you are to run away from us, as &s;oon as you
get loo&s;e, we will keep you confined in an
i&s;land.&endq;&mdash;He was, however, on the whole,
very good company. Mr. Donald M'Leod
expre&s;&s;ed very well the gradual impre&s;&s;ion made
by Dr. John&s;on on tho&s;e who are &s;o fortunate as
to obtain his acquaintance. &startq;When you &s;ee
him fir&s;t, you are &s;truck with aweful reve|rence;
<PB N="336" REF="342">
&mdash;then you admire him;&mdash;and then you
love him cordially.&endq;</P>
<P>I read this evening &s;ome part of Voltaire's
Hi&s;tory of the War in 1741, and of Lord
Kames again&s;t Hereditary Indefea&s;ible Right.
This is a very &s;light circum&s;tance, with which
I &s;hould not trouble my reader, but for the
&s;ake of ob&s;erving, that every man &s;hould keep
minutes of whatever he reads. Every circum|&s;tance
of his &s;tudies &s;hould be recorded; what
books he has con&s;ulted; how much of them
he has read; at what times; how often the
&s;ame authors; and what opinions he formed of
them, at different periods of his life.&mdash;Such
an account would much illu&s;trate the hi&s;tory
of his mind.</P>

<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>1&s;t October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I &s;hewed to Dr. John&s;on ver&s;es in a maga|zine,
on his Dictionary, compo&s;ed of uncommon
words taken from it:
<Q>&startq;Little of <HI>Anthropopathy</HI> has he,&endq; &amp;c.</Q>
He read a few of them, and &s;aid, &startq;I am not
an&s;werable for all the words in my Dictionary.&endq;
&mdash;I told him, that Garrick kept a book of all
who had either prai&s;ed or abu&s;ed him.&mdash;On the
&s;ubject of his own reputation, he &s;aid, &startq;Now
that I &s;ee it has been &s;o current a topick, I wi&s;h
I had done &s;o too; but it could not well be
done now, as &s;o many things are &s;cattered in
<PB N="337" REF="343">
news-papers.&endq;&mdash;He &s;aid, he was angry at a
boy of Oxford, who wrote in his defence
again&s;t Kenrick; becau&s;e it was doing him
hurt to an&s;wer Kenrick. He was told after|wards,
the boy was to come to him to a&s;k a
a favour. He fir&s;t thought to treat him rudely,
on account of his meddling in that bu&s;ine&s;s;
but then he con&s;idered, he had meant to do
him all the &s;ervice in his power; and he took
another re&s;olution; he told him he would do
what he could for him, and did &s;o; and the
boy was &s;atisfied. He &s;aid, he did not know
how his pamphlet was done, as he had read very
little of it. The boy made a good figure at Ox|ford,
but died. He remarked, that attacks on
authours did them much &s;ervice. &startq;A man who
tells me my play is very bad, is le&s;s my enemy
than he who lets it die in &s;ilence. A man,
who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to be talked of, is much
helped by being attacked.&endq;&mdash;Garrick, I ob|&s;erved,
had been often &s;o helped.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;Yes, &s;ir; though Garrick had more opportu|nities
than almo&s;t any man, to keep the publick
in mind of him, by exhibiting him&s;elf to &s;uch
numbers, he would not have had &s;o much repu|tation,
had he not been &s;o much attacked.
Every attack produces a defence; and &s;o at|tention
is engaged. There is no &s;port in mere
prai&s;e, when people are all of a mind.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;|well.</HI>
&startq;Then Hume is not the wor&s;e for
<PB N="338" REF="344">
Beattie's attack?&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;He is, becau&s;e
Beattie has confuted him. I do not &s;ay, but
that the may be &s;ome attacks which will
hurt an authour. Though Hume &s;uffered from
Beattie, he was the better for other attacks.&endq;
(He certainly could not include in that number
tho&s;e of Dr. Adams, and Mr. Tytler.)&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;|well.</HI>
&startq;Gold&s;mith is the better for attacks.&endq;&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Yes,&endq; &s;ir; but he does not think &s;o
yet. When Gold&s;mith and I publi&s;hed, each
of us &s;omething, at the &s;ame time, we were
given to under&s;tand that we might review each
other. Gold&s;mith was for accepting the offer.
I &s;aid, No; &s;et Reviewers at defiance.&mdash;It
was &s;aid to old Bentley, upon the attacks
again&s;t him, &startq;Why, they'll write you down.&endq;
&startq;No, &s;ir, he replied; depend upon it, no man
was ever written down but by him&s;elf.&endq; He
ob&s;erved to me afterwards, that the advantages
authours derived from attacks, were chiefly in
&s;ubjects of ta&s;te, where you cannot confute, as
&s;o much may be &s;aid on either &s;ide.&mdash;He told
me he did not know who was the authour of the
<HI>Adventures of a Guinea,</HI> but that the book&s;eller
had &s;ent the fir&s;t volume to him in manu&s;cript,
to have his opinion if it &s;hould be printed;
and he thought it &s;hould.</P>
<P>The weather being now &s;omewhat better,
Mr. James M^cDonald, factor to Sir Alexander
M^cDonald in Slate, in&s;i&s;ted that all the com|pany
<PB N="339" REF="345">
at O&s;tig &s;hould go to the hou&s;e at Armi|dale,
which Sir Alexander had left, having
gone with his lady to Edinburgh, and be his

<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>2d October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;that a Chief and his Lady
&s;hould make their hou&s;e like a court. They
&s;hould have a certain number of the gentlemen's
daughters to receive their education in the fa|mily,
to learn pa&s;try and &s;uch things from the
hou&s;ekeeper, and manners from my lady.
That was the way in the great families in
Wales; at Lady Sali&s;bury's, Mrs. Thrale's
grandmother, and at Lady Philips's. I di|&s;tingui&s;h
the families by the ladies, as I
&s;peak of what was properly their province.
There were always &s;ix young ladies at Sir John
Philips's: when one was married, her place
was filled up. There was a large &s;chool-room,
where they learnt needle-work and other
things.&endq;&mdash;I ob&s;erved, that, at &s;ome courts in
Germany, there were academies for the pages,
who are the &s;ons of gentlemen, and receive their
education without any expence to their pa|rents.
Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, that manners were
be&s;t learnt at tho&s;e courts. &startq;You are admitted
<PB N="340" REF="346">
with great facility to the prince's company,
and yet mu&s;t treat him with great re&s;pect. At
a great court, you are at &s;uch a di&s;tance that
you get no good.&endq;&mdash;I &s;aid, &startq;Very true: a
man &s;ees the court of Ver&s;ailles, as if he &s;aw it
on a theatre.&endq;&mdash;He &s;aid, &startq;The be&s;t book that
ever was written upon good-breeding, <HI>Il Cor|teggiano,</HI>
by Ca&s;tiglione, grew up at the little
court of Urbino, and you &s;hould read it.&endq;&mdash;I
am glad always to have his opinion of books. At
Mr. M'Pher&s;on's, he commended <HI>Whitby's Com|mentary,</HI>
and &s;aid, be had heard him called rather
lax; but he did not perceive it. He had looked
at a novel, called <HI>The Man of the World,</HI> at
Ra&s;ay, but thought there was nothing in it.
He &s;aid to-day, while reading my Journal,
&startq;This will be a great trea&s;ure to us &s;ome
years hence.&endq;</P>
<P>Talking of a very penurious gentleman of
our acquaintance, he ob&s;erved, that he ex|ceeded
<HI>L'Avare</HI> in the play. I concurred
with him, and remarked that he would do
well, if introduced in one of Foote's farces;
that the be&s;t way to get it done, would be to
bring Foote to be entertained at his hou&s;e for a
a week, and then it would be <HI>facit indignatio.</HI>&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, I wi&s;h he had him. I, who
have eat his bread, will not give him to him.
but I &s;hould be glad he came hone&s;tly by him.&endq;</P>

if he feels that he expo&s;es him&s;elf. If he was
with two taylors&endq;&mdash;&startq;Or with two founders,&endq;

fall a talking on the method of making can|non,
though both of them would &s;oon &s;ee that
he did not know what metal a cannon is made
of.&endq;&mdash;We were very &s;ocial and merry in his room
this forenoon. In the evening the company
danced as u&s;ual. We performed, with much ac|tivity,
a dance which, I &s;uppo&s;e, the emigration
from Sky has occa&s;ioned. They call it <HI>America.</HI>
Each of the couples, after the common <HI>involu|tions</HI>
and <HI>evolutions,</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ively whirls round in
a circle, till all are in motion; and the dance
&s;eems intended to &s;hew how emigration catches,
till a whole neighbourhood is &s;et afloat.&mdash;Mrs.
M'Kinnon told me, that la&s;t year when a &s;hip
&s;ailed from Portree for America, the people
on &s;hore were almo&s;t di&s;tracted when they &s;aw
their relations go off; they lay down on the
ground, tumbled, and tore the gra&s;s with
<PB N="342" REF="348">
their teeth.&mdash;This year there was not a tear
&s;hed. The people on &s;hore &s;eemed to think
that they would &s;oon follow. This indiffer|ence
is a mortal &s;ign for the country.</P>
<P>We danced to-night to the mu&s;ick of the
bagpipe, which made us beat the ground with
prodigious force. I thought it better to en|deavour
to conciliate the kindne&s;s of the
people of Sky, by joining heartily in their
amu&s;ements, than to play the ab&s;tract &s;cholar.
I looked on this Tour to the Hebrides as a
copartner&s;hip between Dr. John&s;on and me.
Each was to do all he could to promote its
&s;ucce&s;s; and I have &s;ome rea&s;on to flatter my&s;elf,
that my gayer exertions were of &s;ervice to us.
Dr. John&s;on's immen&s;e fund of knowledge and
wit was a wonderful &s;ource of admiration and
delight to them; but they had it only at times;
and they required to have the intervals agree|ably
filled up, and even little elucidations of
his learned text. I was al&s;o fortunate enough
frequently to draw him forth to talk, when he
would otherwi&s;e have been &s;ilent. The foun|tain
was at times locked up, till I opened the
&s;pring.&mdash;It was curious to hear the Hebridians,
when any di&s;pute happened while he was out
of the room, &s;aying, &startq;Stay till Dr. John&s;on
comes: &s;ay that to <HI>him!</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;I cannot but
laugh, to think of my&s;elf roving among the&endq;
<PB N="343" REF="349">
&startq;Hebrides at &s;ixty. I wonder where I &s;hall rove
at four&s;core!&endq;&mdash;This evening he di&s;puted the
truth of what is &s;aid, as to the people of St.
Kilda catching cold whenever &s;trangers come.
&startq;How can there, &s;aid he, be phy&s;ical effect
without a phy&s;ical cau&s;e?&endq;&mdash;He added, laugh|ing,
&startq;the arrival of a &s;hip full of &s;trangers
would kill them; for if one &s;tranger gives them
one cold, two &s;trangers mu&s;t give them two
colds; and &s;o in proportion.&endq;&mdash;I wondered to
hear him ridicule this, as he had prai&s;ed
M'Aulay for putting it in his book; &s;aying,
that it was manly in him to tell a fact, how|ever
&s;trange, if he him&s;elf believed it. He
&s;aid, the evidence was not adequate to the im|probability
of the thing; that if a phy&s;ician,
rather di&s;po&s;ed to be incredulous, &s;hould go to
St. Kilda, and report the fact, then he would
begin to look about him. They &s;aid, it was
annually proved by M'Leod's &s;teward, on
who&s;e arrival all the inhabitants caught cold.
He jocularly remarked, &startq;the &s;teward always
comes to demand &s;omething from them; and
&s;o they fall a coughing. I &s;uppo&s;e the people
in Sky all take a cold, when&mdash;(naming a
certain per&s;on) comes.&endq;&mdash;They &s;aid, he came
only in &s;ummer.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;That is out of ten|derne&s;s

<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>3d October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Jo&s;eph reported that the wind was &s;till
again&s;t us. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;A wind, or
not a wind? that is the que&s;tion;&endq; for he can
amu&s;e him&s;elf at times with a little play of
words, or rather of &s;entences. I remember
when he turned his cup at Aberbrothick, where
we drank tea, he muttered, <HI>Claudite jam rivos,
pueri.</HI> I mu&s;t again and again apologize to
fa&s;tidious readers, for recording &s;uch minute
particulars. They prove the &s;crupulous fidelity
of my Journal. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid it was a very
exact picture of a portion of his life.</P>
<P>While we were chatting in the indolent &s;tile
of men who were to &s;tay here all this day at
lea&s;t, we were &s;uddenly rou&s;ed by being told
that the wind was fair, that a little fleet of
herring bu&s;&s;es was pa&s;&s;ing by for Mull, and
that Mr. Simp&s;on's ve&s;&s;el was about to &s;ail,
Hugh M^cDonald, the &s;kipper, came to us, and
was impatient that we &s;hould get ready, which
we &s;oon did. Dr. John&s;on, with compo&s;ure
and &s;olemnity, repeated the ob&s;ervation of
Epictetus, that, &startq;as man has the voyage of
death before him,&mdash;whatever may be his em|ployment,
he &s;hould be ready at the ma&s;ter's
call; and an old man &s;hould never be far from
the &s;hore, le&s;t he &s;hould not be able to get
him&s;elf ready.&endq; He rode, and I and the other
<PB N="345" REF="351">
gentlemen walked, about an Engli&s;h mile to
the &s;hore, where the ve&s;&s;el lay. Dr. John&s;on
&s;aid, he &s;hould never forget Sky, and returned
thanks for all civilities. We were carried to
the ve&s;&s;el in a &s;mall boat which &s;he had, and
we &s;et &s;ail very bri&s;kly about one o'clock. I
was much plea&s;ed with the motion for many
hours. Dr. John&s;on grew &s;ick, and retired
under cover, as it rained a good deal. I kept
above, that I might have fre&s;h air, and finding
my&s;elf not affected by the motion of the ve&s;&s;el,
I exulted in being a &s;tout &s;eaman, while Dr.
John&s;on was quite in a &s;tate of annihilation.
But I was &s;oon humbled; for after imagining
that I could go with ea&s;e to America or the
Ea&s;t-Indies, I became very &s;ick, but kept
above board, though it rained hard.</P>
<P>As we had been detained &s;o long in Sky by
bad weather, we gave up the &s;cheme that Col
had planned for us of vi&s;iting &s;everal i&s;lands,
and contented our&s;elves with the pro&s;pect of
&s;eeing Mull, and Icolmkill, and Inchkenneth,
which lie near to it.</P>
<P>Mr. Simp&s;on was &s;anguine in his hopes for
a while, the wind being fair for us. He &s;aid
he would land us at Icolmkill that night. But
when the wind failed, it was re&s;olved we &s;hould
make for the Sound of Mull, and land in the
harbour of Tobermorie. We kept near the five
herring ve&s;&s;els for &s;ome time; but afterwards
<PB N="346" REF="352">
four of them got before us, and one little
wherry fell behind us. When we got in full
view of the point of Ardnamurchan, the wind
changed, and was directly again&s;t our getting
into the &s;ound. We were then obliged to tack,
and get forward in that tedious manner. As
we advanced, the &s;torm grew greater, and the
&s;ea very rough. Col then began to talk of
making for Egg, or Canna, or his own i&s;land.
Our &s;kipper &s;aid, he would get us into the
Sound. Having &s;truggled for this a good
while in vain, he &s;aid, he would pu&s;h forward
till we were near the land of Mull, where we
might ca&s;t anchor, and lie till the morning;
for although, before this, there had been a good
moon, and I had pretty di&s;tinctly &s;een not only
the land of Mull, but up the Sound, and the
country of Morven as at one end of it, the
night was now grown very dark. Our crew
con&s;i&s;ted of one M^cDonald, our &s;kipper, and
two &s;ailors, one of whom had but one eye:
Mr. Simp&s;on him&s;elf, Col, and Hugh M^cDonald
his &s;ervant, all helped. Simp&s;on &s;aid, he would
willingly go for Col, if young Col or his &s;er|vant
would undertake to pilot us to a harbour;
but, as the i&s;land is low land, it was dangerous
to run upon it in the dark. Col and his &s;er|vant
appeared a little dubious. The &s;cheme
of running for Canna &s;eemed then to be em|braced;
but Canna was ten leagues off, all out
<PB N="347" REF="353">
of our way; and they were afraid to attempt
the harbour of Egg. All the&s;e different plans
were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in agitation. The old &s;kipper
&s;till tried to make for the land of Mull; but
then it was con&s;idered that there was no place
there where we could anchor in &s;afety. Much
time was lo&s;t in &s;triving again&s;t the &s;torm. At
la&s;t it became &s;o rough, and threatened to be
&s;o much wor&s;e, that Col and his &s;ervant took
more courage, and &s;aid they would undertake
to hit one of the harbours in Col.&mdash;&startq;Then
let us run for it in GOD'S name,&endq; &s;aid the
&s;kipper; and in&s;tantly we turned towards it.
The little wherry which had fallen behind us,
had hard work. The ma&s;ter begged that, if
we made for Col, we &s;hould put out a light to
him. Accordingly one of the &s;ailors waved a
glowing peat for &s;ome time. The various
difficulties that were &s;tarted, gave me a good
deal of apprehen&s;ion, from which I was re|lieved,
when I found we were to run for a har|bour
before the wind. But my relief was but
of &s;hort duration; for I &s;oon heard that our
&s;ails were very bad, and were in danger of
being torn in pieces, in which ca&s;e we &s;hould
be driven upon the rocky &s;hore of Col. It was
very dark indeed, and there was a heavy and in|ce&s;&s;ant
rain. The &s;parks of the burning peat flew
&s;o much about, that I dreaded the ve&s;&s;el might
take fire. Then, as Col was a &s;port&s;man, and
<PB N="348" REF="354">
had powder on board, I figured that we might
be blown up. Simp&s;on and he both appeared a
little frightened, which made me more &s;o;
and the perpetual talking, or rather &s;houting,
which was carried on in Er&s;e, alarmed me &s;till
more. A man is always &s;u&s;picious of what is
&s;aying in an unknown tongue; and if fear be
his pa&s;&s;ion at the time, he grows more afraid.
Our ve&s;&s;el often lay &s;o much on one &s;ide, that
I trembled le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be over&s;et; and in|deed
they told me afterwards, that they had
run her &s;ometimes to within an inch of the
water, &s;o anxious were they to make what ha&s;te
they could before the night &s;hould be wor&s;e. I
now &s;aw what I never &s;aw before, a prodigious
&s;ea, with immen&s;e billows coming upon a
ve&s;&s;el, &s;o as that it &s;eemed hardly po&s;&s;ible to
e&s;cape. There was &s;omething grandly horrible
in the &s;ight. I am glad I have &s;een it once.
Amid&s;t all the&s;e terrifying circum&s;tances, I
endeavoured to compo&s;e my mind. It was not
ea&s;y to do it; for all the &s;tories that I had
heard of the dangerous &s;ailing among the
Hebrides, which is proverbial, came full upon
my recollection. When I thought of tho&s;e who
were deare&s;t to me, and would &s;uffer &s;everely,
&s;hould I be lo&s;t, I upbraided my&s;elf, as not
having a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for putting my&s;elf
in &s;uch danger. Piety afforded me comfort;
yet I was di&s;turbed by the objections that have
<PB N="349" REF="355">
been made again&s;t a particular providence, and
by the arguments of tho&s;e who maintain that it
is in vain to hope that the petitions of an indi|vidual,
or even of congregations, can have any
influence with the Deity; objections which
have been often made, and which Dr. Hawke&s;|worth
has lately revived, in his Preface to the
Voyages to the South Seas; but Dr. Ogden's
excellent doctrine on the efficacy of interce&s;|&s;ion,
prevailed.</P>
<P>It was half an hour after eleven before we
&s;et our&s;elves in the cour&s;e for Col. As I &s;aw
them all bu&s;y doing &s;omething, I a&s;ked Col,
with much earne&s;tne&s;s, what I could do. He,
with a happy readine&s;s, put into my hand a
rope, which was fixed to the top of one of the
ma&s;ts, and told me to hold it till he bid me
pull. If I had con&s;idered the matter, I might
have &s;een that this could not be of the lea&s;t
&s;ervice; but his object was to keep me out of
the way of tho&s;e who were bu&s;y working the
ve&s;&s;el, and at the &s;ame time to divert my fear,
by employing me, and making me think that I
was of u&s;e. Thus did I &s;tand firm to my po&s;t,
while the wind and rain beat upon me, always
expecting a call to pull my rope.</P>
<P>The man with one eye &s;teered; old M^cDo|nald,
and Col and his &s;ervant, lay upon the
fore-ca&s;tle, looking &s;harp out for the harbour.
It was nece&s;&s;ary to carry much <HI>cloth,</HI> as they
<PB N="350" REF="356">
termed it, that is to &s;ay, much &s;ail, in order to
keep the ve&s;&s;el off the &s;hore of Col. This made
violent plunging in a rough &s;ea. At la&s;t they
&s;pied the harbour of Lochiern, and Col cried,
&startq;Thank GOD, we are &s;afe!&endq; We run up till
we were oppo&s;ite to it, and &s;oon afterwards we
got into it, and ca&s;t anchor.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on had all this time been quiet and
unconcerned. He had lain down on one of
the beds, and having got free from &s;ickne&s;s, was
&s;atisfied. The truth is, he knew nothing all
this while of the danger we were in; but, fear|le&s;s
and unconcerned, might have &s;aid, in the
words which he has cho&s;en for the motto to his
<HI>Rambler,</HI>
<Q>Quo me cunque rapit tempe&s;tas, deferor ho&s;pes.</Q>
Once, during the doubtful con&s;ultations, he
a&s;ked whither we were going; and upon being
told that it was not certain whether to Mull or
Col, he cried, &startq;Col for my money!&endq;&mdash;I now
went down, with Col and Mr. Simp&s;on, to vi&s;it
him. He was lying in philo&s;ophick tranquil|lity,
with a greyhound of Col's at his back,
keeping him warm. Col is quite the <HI>Juvenis
qui gaudet canibus,</HI> He had, when we left Ta|li&s;ker,
two greyhounds, two terriers, a pointer,
and a large Newfoundland water-dog. He lo&s;t
one of his terriers by the road, but had &s;till
five dogs with him. I was very ill, and very
de&s;irous to get to &s;hore. When I was told
<PB N="351" REF="357">
that we could not land that night, as the &s;torm
had now increa&s;ed, I looked &s;o mi&s;erably, as Col
afterwards informed me, that what Shak&s;peare
has made the Frenchman &s;ay of the Engli&s;h
&s;oldiers, when &s;cantily dieted, &startq;<HI>Piteous they
will look, like drowned mice!&endq;</HI> might, I believe,
have been well applied to me. There was in
the harbour, before us, a Campbelltown ve&s;&s;el,
the Betty, Kenneth Mori&s;on ma&s;ter, taking in
kelp, and bound for Ireland. We &s;ent our
boat to beg beds for two gentlemen, and that
the ma&s;ter would &s;end his boat, which was
larger than ours. He accordingly did &s;o, and
Col and I were accommodated in his ve&s;&s;el till
the morning.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>4th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>About eight o'clock we went in the boat to
Mr. Simp&s;on's ve&s;&s;el, and took in Dr. John&s;on.
He was quite well, though he had ta&s;ted no|thing
but a di&s;h of tea &s;ince Saturday night.
On our expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome &s;urprize at this, he
&s;aid, that, &startq;when he lodged in the Temple,
and had no regular &s;y&s;tem of life, he had fa&s;ted
for two days at a time, during which he had
gone about vi&s;iting, though not at the hours of
dinner or &s;upper; that he had drank tea, but
eat no bread; that this was no intentional fa&s;t|ing,
but happened ju&s;t in the cour&s;e of a literary
life.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="358">
There was a little mi&s;erable publick-hou&s;e
clo&s;e upon the &s;hore, to which we &s;hould have
gone, had we landed la&s;t night: but this morn|ing
Col re&s;olved to take us directly to the hou&s;e
of Captain Lauchlan M'Lean, a de&s;cendant of
his family, who had acquired a fortune in the
Ea&s;t-Indies, and taken a farm in Col. We had
about an Engli&s;h mile to go to it. Col and
Jo&s;eph, and &s;ome others, ran to &s;ome little
hor&s;es, called here <HI>Shelties,</HI> that were running
wild on a heath, and catched one of them. We
had a &s;addle with us, which was clapped upon
it, and a &s;traw halter was put on its head. Dr.
John&s;on was then mounted, and Jo&s;eph very
&s;lowly and gravely led the hor&s;e. I &s;aid to
Dr. John&s;on, &startq;I wi&s;h, &s;ir, <HI>the club</HI> &s;aw you in
this attitude<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This curious exhibition may perhaps remind &s;ome of my readers of the ludicrous lines, made during Sir Robert Walpole's admini&s;tration, on Mr. George (afterwards, Lord) Littleton, though the figures of the two per&s;onages mu&s;t be allowed to be very different:
<Q><L>&startq;But who is this a&s;tride the pony;</L>

<L>Dat be de great orator, Littletony.&endq;</L></Q></NOTE>&endq;</P>
<P>It was a very heavy rain, and I was we to
the &s;kin. Captain M'Lean had but a poor
temporary hou&s;e, or rather hut; however, it
was a very good haven to us. There was a
blazing peat-fire, and Mrs. M'Lean, daughter
of the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h, got us tea. I felt
&s;till the motion of the &s;ea. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid,
<PB N="353" REF="359">
it was not imagination, but a continuation of
motion in the fluids, like that of the &s;ea it&s;elf
after the &s;torm is over.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome books on the board which
&s;erved as a chimney-piece. Dr. John&s;on took
up Burnett's <HI>Hi&s;tory of his own Times.</HI> He &s;aid,
&startq;The fir&s;t part of it is one of the mo&s;t enter|taining
books in the Engli&s;h language; it is
quite dramatick: while he went about every
where, &s;aw every where, and heard every where.
By the fir&s;t part, I mean &s;o far as it ap|pears
that Burnet him&s;elf was actually en|gaged
in what he has told; and this may be
ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed.&endq; Captain M'Lean cen&s;ured
Burnet, for his high prai&s;e of Lauderdale in a
dedication, when he &s;hews him in his hi&s;tory to
have been &s;o bad a man.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;I do not
my&s;elf think that a man &s;hould &s;ay in a dedica|tion
what he could not &s;ay in a hi&s;tory. How|ever,
allowance &s;hould be made; for there is a
great difference. The known &s;tyle of a dedi|cation
is flattery: it profe&s;&s;es to flatter. There
is the &s;ame difference between what a man &s;ays
in a dedication, and what he &s;ays in a hi&s;tory,
as between a lawyer's pleading a cau&s;e and re|porting
it.&endq;</P>
<P>The day pa&s;&s;ed away plea&s;antly enough.
The wind became fair for Mull in the evening,
and Mr. Simp&s;on re&s;olved to &s;ail next morning:
but, having been thrown into the i&s;land of Col,
<PB N="354" REF="360">
we were unwilling to leave it unexamined,

<P>I ro&s;e, and wrote my Journal till about nine;
and then went to Dr. John&s;on, who &s;at up in
bed, and talked and laughed. I &s;aid, it was
curious to look back ten years, to the time
when we fir&s;t thought of vi&s;iting the Hebrides.
How di&s;tant and improbable the &s;cheme then
appeared! Yet here we were actually among
them.&mdash;&startq;Sir,&endq; &s;aid he, people may come to do
any thing almo&s;t, by talking of it. I really
believe, I could talk my&s;elf into building a
hou&s;e upon i&s;land I&s;a, though I &s;hould probably
never come back again to &s;ee it. I could ea|&s;ily
per&s;uade Reynolds to do it; and there
would be no great &s;in in per&s;uading him to do
it. Sir, he would rea&s;on thus: &startq;What will it
co&s;t me to be there once in two or three &s;um|mers?
&mdash;Why, perhaps, five hundred pounds;
and what is that, in compari&s;on of having a
fine retreat, to which a man can go, or to
which he can &s;end a friend?&endq; He would never
find out that he may have this within twenty
miles of London.&mdash;Then I would tell him,
that he may marry one of the Mi&s;s M'Leods,
a lady of great family.&mdash;Sir, it is &s;urpri&s;ing
<PB N="355" REF="361">
how people will go to a di&s;tance for what they
may have at home. I knew a lady who came
up from Lincoln&s;hire to Knight&s;bridge with
one of her daughters, and gave five guineas a
week for a lodging and a warm bath; that is,
mere warm water. <HI>That,</HI> you know, could not
be had in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire!</HI> She &s;aid, it was made
either too hot or too cold there.&endq;</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, Dr. John&s;on and I, and Jo|&s;eph,
mounted hor&s;es, and Col and the captain
walked with us about a &s;hort mile acro&s;s the
i&s;land. We paid a vi&s;it to the Reverend Mr.
Hector M'Lean. His pari&s;h con&s;i&s;ts of the
i&s;lands of Col and Tyr-yi. He was about &s;e|venty-&s;even
years of age, a decent eccle&s;ia&s;tick,
dre&s;&s;ed in a full &s;uit of black, and a black wig.
He appeared like a Dutch pa&s;tor, or one of the
a&s;&s;embly of divines at We&s;tmin&s;ter. Dr. John|&s;on
ob&s;erved to me afterwards, that he was a
fine old man, and was as well-dre&s;&s;ed, and had
as much dignity in his appearance as the dean
of a cathedral. We were told, that he had a
valuable library, though but poor accommo|dation
for it, being obliged to keep his books
in large che&s;ts. It was curious to &s;ee him and
Dr. John&s;on together. Neither of them heard
very di&s;tinctly; &s;o each of them talked in his
own way, and at the &s;ame time. Mr. M'Lean
&s;aid, he had a Confutation of Bayle, by Leib|nitz.
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;A confutation of Bayle, &s;ir!
<PB N="356" REF="362">
What part of Bayle do you mean? The great|e&s;t
part of his writings is not confutable: it is
hi&s;torical and critical.&endq;&mdash;Mr. M'Lean &s;aid,
&startq;the irreligious part;&endq;and proceeded to talk
of Leibnitz's controver&s;y with Clarke, calling
Leibnitz a great man.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>&startq;Why, &s;ir,
Leibnitz per&s;i&s;ted in affirming that Newton
called &s;pace <HI>&s;en&s;orium numinis,</HI> notwith&s;tanding
he was corrected, and de&s;ired to ob&s;erve that
Newton's words were QUASI <HI>&s;en&s;orium numinis.</HI>
No, &s;ir; Leibnitz was as paltry a fellow as I
know. Out of re&s;pect to Queen Caroline, who
patroni&s;ed him, Clarke treated him too well.&endq;</P>
<P>During the time that Dr. John&s;on was thus
going on, the old mini&s;ter was &s;tanding with his
back to the fire, cre&s;ting up erect, pulling down
the front of his perriwig, and talking what a
great man Leibnitz was. To give an idea of
the &s;cene, would require a page with two co|lumns;
but it ought rather to be repre&s;ented
by two good players. The old gentleman &s;aid,
Clarke was very wicked, for going &s;o much
into the Arian &s;y&s;tem. &startq;I will not &s;ay he was
wicked, &s;aid Dr. John&s;on; he might be mi&s;|taken.&endq;
&mdash;<HI>M'Lean.</HI> &startq;He was wicked, to &s;hut
his eyes again&s;t the Scriptures; and worthy
men in England have &s;ince confuted him to all
intents and purpo&s;es.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;I know not
<HI>who</HI> has confuted him to <HI>all intents and purpo&s;es.</HI>&endq;
&mdash;Here again there was a double talking, each
<PB N="357" REF="363">
continuing to maintain his own argument,
without hearing exactly what the other &s;aid.</P>
<P>I regretted that Dr. John&s;on did not prac|tice
the art of accommodating him&s;elf to dif|ferent
&s;orts of people. Had he been &s;ofter
with this venerable old man, we might have
had more conver&s;ation; but his forcible &s;pirit,
and impetuo&s;ity of manner, may be &s;aid to
&s;pare neither &s;ex nor age. I have &s;een even
Mrs. Thrale &s;tunned; but I have often main|tained,
that it is better he &s;hould retain his
own manner. Pliability of addre&s;s I conceive
to be incon&s;i&s;tent with that maje&s;tick power of
mind which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and which produces
&s;uch noble effects. A lofty oak will not bend
like a &s;upple willow.</P>
<P>He told me afterwards, he liked firmne&s;s in
an old man, and was plea&s;ed to &s;ee Mr. M'Lean
&s;o orthodox. &startq;At his age, it is too late for a
man to be a&s;king him&s;elf que&s;tions as to his
belief.&endq;</P>
<P>We rode to the northern part of the i&s;land,
where we &s;aw the ruins of a church or chapel.
We then proceeded to a place called Gri&s;&s;ipol,
or the rough Pool.</P>
<P>At Gri&s;&s;ipol we found a good farm-hou&s;e,
belonging to the Laird of Col, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
by Mr. M'Sweyn. On the beach here there is
a &s;ingular variety of curious &s;tones. I picked
up one very like a &s;mall cucumber. By the
<PB N="358" REF="364">
bye, Dr. John&s;on told me, that Gay's line in
the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> &startq;As men &s;hould &s;erve a
cucumber, &amp;c.&endq; has no waggi&s;h meaning, with
reference to men flinging away cucumbers as
too <HI>cooling,</HI> which &s;ome have thought; for it has
been a common &s;aying of phy&s;icians in Eng|land,
that a cucumber &s;hould be well &s;liced,
and dre&s;&s;ed with pepper and vinegar, and then
thrown out, as good for nothing.&mdash;Mr.
M'Sweyn's predece&s;&s;ors had been in Sky from
a very remote period, upon the e&s;tate belong|ing
to M'Leod; probably before M'Leod
had it. The name is certainly Norwegian,
from <HI>Sueno,</HI> King of Norway. This Mr.
M'Sweyn left Sky upon the late M'Leod's
rai&s;ing his rents. He then got this farm from
Col.</P>
<P>He appeared to be near four&s;core; but
looked as fre&s;h, and was as &s;trong, as a man
of fifty. His &s;on Hugh looked older; and, as
Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved, had more the manners
of an old man than he. I had often heard of
&s;uch in&s;tances, but never &s;aw one before.
Mrs. M'Sweyn was a decent old gentlewoman.
She was dre&s;&s;ed in tartan, and could &s;peak no|thing
but Er&s;e. She &s;aid, &s;he had taught Sir
James M^cDonald Er&s;e, and would teach me
&s;oon. I could now &s;ing a ver&s;e of the &s;ong,
<HI>Hatyin foam'eri,</HI> made in honour of Allan, the
famous Captain of Clanranald, who fell at
<PB N="359" REF="365">
Sherrif-muir, and of whom his &s;ervant, who
lay on the field watching his dead body, being
a&s;ked next day who that was, an&s;wered, &startq;He
was a man ye&s;terday.&endq;</P>
<P>We were entertained here with a primitive
heartine&s;s. Whi&s;ky was &s;erved round in a
&s;hell, according to the ancient Highland cu&s;|tom.
Dr. John&s;on would not partake of it;
but, being de&s;irous to do honour to the modes
&startq;of other times,&endq; drank &s;ome water out of the
&s;hell.</P>
<P>In the forenoon Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;it would
require great re&s;ignation to live in one of the&s;e
i&s;lands.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;I don't know, &s;ir; I have
felt my&s;elf at times, in a &s;tate of almo&s;t mere
phy&s;ical exi&s;tence, &s;atisfied to eat, drink and
&s;leep, and walk about, and enjoy my own
thoughts; and I can figure a continuation of
this.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>&startq;Aye, &s;ir; but if you were
&s;hut up here, your own thoughts would tor|ment
you: you would think of Edinburgh or
London, and that you could not be there.&endq;</P>
<P>We &s;et out after dinner for <HI>Breacacha,</HI> the
family &s;eat of the Laird of Col, accompanied
by the young laird, who had now got a hor&s;e,
and by the younger Mr. M'Sweyn, who&s;e wife
had gone thither before us, to prepare every
thing for our reception, the laird and his
family being ab&s;ent at Aberdeen. It is called
<HI>Breacacha,</HI> or the Spotted Field; becau&s;e in
<PB N="360" REF="366">
&s;ummer it is enamelled with clover and dai&s;ies,
as young Col told me. We pa&s;&s;ed by a place
where there is a very large &s;tone, I may call it
a <HI>rock;</HI>&mdash;&startq;a va&s;t weight for Ajax.&endq; The
tradition is, that a giant threw &s;uch another
&s;tone at his mi&s;tre&s;s up to the top of a hill at a
&s;mall di&s;tance; and that &s;he, in return, threw
this ma&s;s down to him. It was all in &s;port.</P>
<Q>Malo me petit la&s;civa puella.</Q>
<P>As we advanced, we came to a large extent
of plain ground. I had not &s;een &s;uch a place
for a long time. Col and I took a gallop upon
it by way of race. It was very refre&s;hing to
me, after having been &s;o long taking &s;hort
&s;teps in hilly countries. It was like &s;tretching
a man's legs after being cramped in a &s;hort
bed. We al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by a large extent
of &s;and hills, near two miles &s;quare. Dr.
John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;he never had the image before.
It was horrible, if barrenne&s;s and danger could
be &s;o.&endq; I heard him, after we were in the
hou&s;e of <HI>Breacacha,</HI> repeating to him&s;elf, as he
walked about the room,
<Q><L>&startq;And, &s;mother'd in the du&s;ty whirlwind, dies.&endq;</L></Q>
Probably he had been thinking of the whole
of the &s;imile in <HI>Cato,</HI> of which that is the con|cluding
line: the &s;andy de&s;art had &s;truck him
&s;o &s;trongly. The &s;and has of late been blown
<PB N="361" REF="367">
over a good deal of meadow; and the people
of the i&s;land &s;ay, that their fathers remembered
much of the &s;pace which is now covered with
&s;and, to have been under tillage. Col's hou&s;e
is &s;ituated on a bay called <HI>Breacacha</HI> Bay. We
found here a neat new-built gentleman's hou&s;e,
better than any we had been in &s;ince we were
at Lord Errol's. Dr. John&s;on reli&s;hed it much
at fir&s;t, but &s;oon remarked to me, that &startq;there
was nothing becoming a Chief about it: it was
a mere trade&s;man's box.&endq; He &s;eemed quite at
home, and no longer found any difficulty in
u&s;ing the Highland addre&s;s; for as &s;oon as we
arrived, he &s;aid, with a &s;pirited familiarity,
&startq;Now <HI>Col,</HI> if you could get us a di&s;h of tea.&endq;
&mdash;Dr. John&s;on and I had each an excellent
bed-room. We had a di&s;pute which of us had
the be&s;t curtains. His were rather the be&s;t,
being of linen; but I in&s;i&s;ted that my bed had
the be&s;t po&s;ts, which was undeniable. &startq;Well,
&s;aid he; if you <HI>have</HI> the be&s;t <HI>po&s;ts,</HI> we will have
you tied to them, and whipped.&endq;&mdash;I mention
this &s;light circum&s;tance, only to &s;hew how
ready he is, even in mere trifles, to get the
better of his antagoni&s;t, by placing him in a
ludicrous view. I have known him &s;ometimes
u&s;e the &s;ame art, when hard pre&s;&s;ed, in &s;erious
di&s;putation. Gold&s;mith, I remember, to reta|liate
for many a &s;evere defeat which he has
&s;uffered from him, applied to him a lively &s;ay|ing
<PB N="362" REF="368">
in one of Cibber's comedies, which puts
this part of his character in a &s;trong light.&mdash;
&startq;There is no arguing with John&s;on; for, <HI>if
his pi&s;tol mi&s;&s;es fire, he knocks you down with the
but-end of it.</HI>&endq;</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Wedne&s;day, <DATE>6th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>After a &s;uffiency of &s;leep, we a&s;&s;embled at
breakfa&s;t. We were ju&s;t as if in barracks.
Every body was ma&s;ter. We went and viewed
the old ca&s;tle of Col, which is not far from the
pre&s;ent hou&s;e, near the &s;hore, and founded
on a rock. It has never been a large feudal
re&s;idence, and has nothing about it that
requires a particular de&s;cription. Like other
old inconvenient buildings of the &s;ame age, it
exemplified Gray's picture&s;que lines,
<Q><L>&startq;Huge windows that exclude the light,</L>
<L>And pa&s;&s;ages that lead to nothing.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>It may however be worth mentioning, that
on the &s;econd &s;tory we &s;aw a vault, which was,
and &s;till is, the family pri&s;on. There was a
woman put into it by the laird, for theft,
within the&s;e ten years; and any offender would
be confined there yet; for, from the nece&s;&s;ity
of the thing, as the i&s;land is remote from any
power e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, the laird mu&s;t exer|ci&s;e
his juri&s;diction to a certain degree.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="369">
We were &s;hewn, in a corner of this vault, a
hole, into which Col &s;aid greater criminals u&s;ed
to be put. It was now filled up with rubbi&s;h
of different kinds. He &s;aid, it was of a great
depth. &startq;Aye, (&s;aid Dr. John&s;on, &s;miling,)
all &s;uch places, that <HI>are filled up,</HI> were of a great
depth.&endq; He is very quick in &s;hewing that he
does not give credit to carele&s;s or exaggerated
accounts of things. After &s;eeing the ca&s;tle,
we looked at a &s;mall hut near it. It is called
<HI>Teigh Franchich, i. e.</HI> the Frenchman's Hou&s;e.
Col could not tell us the hi&s;tory of it. A poor
man with a wife and children now lived in it.
We went into it, and Dr. John&s;on gave them
&s;ome charity. There was but one bed for all
the family, and the hut was very &s;moky.
When he came out, he &s;aid to me, &startq;<HI>Et hoc
&s;ecundum &s;ententiam philo&s;ophorum e&s;t e&s;&s;e beatus.</HI>&endq;
&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;The philo&s;ophers, when they
placed happine&s;s in a cottage, &s;uppo&s;ed clean|line&s;s,
and no &s;moke.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, they
did not think about either.&endq;</P>
<P>We walked a little in the laird's garden, in
which endeavours have been u&s;ed to rear &s;ome
trees; but, as &s;oon as they got above the &s;ur|rounding
wall, they died. Dr. John&s;on re|commended
&s;owing the &s;eeds of hardy trees,
in&s;tead of planting.</P>
<P>Col and I rode out this morning, and viewed
a part of the i&s;land. In the cour&s;e of our ride,
<PB N="364" REF="370">
we &s;aw a turnip-field, which he had hoed with
his own hands. He fir&s;t introduced this kind
of hu&s;bandry into the We&s;tern i&s;lands. We
al&s;o looked at an appearance of lead, which
&s;eemed very promi&s;ing. It has been long
known; for I found letters to the late laird
from Sir John Are&s;kine and Sir Alexander
Murray, re&s;pecting it.</P>
<P>After dinner, came Mr. M'Lean, of Cor|neck,
brother to I&s;le of Muck, who is a cadet
of the family of Col. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the two
ends of Col which belong to the Duke of
Argyll. Corneck had lately taken a lea&s;e of
them at a very advanced rent, rather than let
the Campbells get a footing in the i&s;land, one
of whom had offered nearly as much as he. Dr.
John&s;on well ob&s;erved, that &startq;landlords err much
when they calculate merely what their land
<HI>may</HI> yield. The rent mu&s;t be in a propor|tionate
ratio of what the land may yield, and
of the power of the tenant to make it yield.
A tenant cannot make by his land, but accord|ing
to the corn and cattle which he has. Sup|po&s;e
you &s;hould give him twice as much land
as he has, it does him no good, unle&s;s he gets
al&s;o more &s;tock. It is clear then, that the
Highland landlords, who let their &s;ub&s;tantial
tenants leave them, are infatuated; for the
poor &s;mall tenants cannot give them good
rents, from the very nature of things. They
<PB N="365" REF="371">
&startq;have not the means of rai&s;ing more from their
farms.&endq; Corneck, Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, was the
mo&s;t di&s;tinct man that he had met with in the&s;e
i&s;les; he did not &s;hut his eyes, or put his fingers
in his ears, which he &s;eemed to think was a
good deal the mode with mo&s;t of the people
whom we have &s;een of late.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Thur&s;day, <DATE>7th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Captain M'Lean joined us this morning at
breakfa&s;t. There came on a dreadful &s;torm of
wind and rain, which continued all day, and
rather increa&s;ed at night. The wind was di|rectly
again&s;t our getting to Mull. We were
in a &s;trange &s;tate of ab&s;traction from the world:
we could neither hear from our friends, nor
write to them. Col had brought Daille <HI>on the
Fathers,</HI> Lucas <HI>on Happine&s;s,</HI> and More's <HI>Dia|logues,</HI>
from the Reverend Mr. M'Lean's, and
Burnet's <HI>Hi&s;tory of his own Times</HI> from Captain
M'Lean's; and he had of his own &s;ome books
of farming, and Gregory's <HI>Geometry.</HI> Dr.
John&s;on read a good deal of Burnet, and of
Gregory, and I ob&s;erved he made &s;ome geome|trical
notes in the end of his pocket-book. I read
a little of Young's Six Weeks Tour through the
Southern Counties; and Ovid's Epi&s;tles, which
I had bought at Inverne&s;s, and which helped to
&s;olace many a weary hour.</P>
<P>We were to have gone with Dr. John&s;on this
morning to &s;ee the mine; but were prevented
<PB N="366" REF="372">
by the &s;torm. While it was raging, he &s;aid,
&startq;We may be glad we are not <HI>damnati ad me|talla.</HI>&endq;</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>8th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Dr. John&s;on appeared to-day very weary of
our pre&s;ent confined &s;ituation. He &s;aid, &startq;I
want to be on the main land, and go on with
exi&s;tence. This is a wa&s;te of life.&endq;</P>
<P>I &s;hall here in&s;ert, without regard to chro|nology,
&s;ome of his conver&s;ation at different
times.</P>
<P>&startq;There was a man &s;ome time ago, who was
well received for two years,&endq; among the gen|tlemen
of Northampton&s;hire, by calling him|&s;elf
my brother. At la&s;t he grew &s;o impudent
as by his influence to get tenants turned out of
their farms. Allen the Printer, who is of that
county, came to me, a&s;king, with much
appearance of doubtfulne&s;s, if I had a brother;
and upon being a&s;&s;ured I had none alive, he
told me of the impo&s;ition, and immediately
wrote to the country, and the fellow was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed.
It plea&s;ed me to hear that &s;o much
was got by u&s;ing my name. It is not every
name that can carry double; do both for a
man's &s;elf and his brother (laughing.) I &s;hould
be glad to &s;ee the fellow. However, I could
have done nothing again&s;t him. A man can
have no redre&s;s for his name being u&s;ed, or
<PB N="367" REF="373">
ridiculous &s;tories being told of him in the
news-papers, except he can &s;hew that he has
&s;uffered damage.&mdash;Some years ago a fooli&s;h
piece were publi&s;hed, &s;aid to be written &startq;<HI>by
S. John&s;on.</HI>&endq; Some of my friends wanted me
to be very angry about this. I &s;aid, it would
be in vain; for the an&s;wer would be, &startq;<HI>S. John&s;on</HI>
may be Simon John&s;on, or Simeon, John&s;on,
or Solomon John&s;on;&endq; and even if the full
name, Samuel John&s;on, had been u&s;ed, it
might be &s;aid, &startq;It is not you; it is a much
cleverer fellow.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Beauclerk and I, and Langton, and Lady
Sydney Beauclerk, mother to our friend, were
one day driving in a coach by Cuper's Gardens,
which were then unoccupied. I, in &s;port,
propo&s;ed that Beauclerk and Langton, and my|&s;elf,
&s;hould take them; and we amu&s;ed our|&s;elves
with &s;cheming how we &s;hould all do our
parts. Lady Sydney grew angry, and &s;aid,
&startq;an old man &s;hould not put &s;uch things in
young people's heads.&endq; She had no notion of
a joke, &s;ir; had come late into life, and had a
mighty unpliable under&s;tanding.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Carte's <HI>Life of the Duke of Ormond</HI> is con&s;i|dered
as a book of authority; but it is ill-written.
The matter is diffu&s;ed in too many
words; there is no animation, no compre&s;&s;ion,
no vigour. Two good volumes in duodecimo
might be made out of the two in folio.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="374">
Talking of our confinement here, I ob&s;erved,
that our di&s;content and impatience could not
be con&s;idered as very unrea&s;onable; for that
we were ju&s;t in the &s;tate of which Seneca com|plains
&s;o grievou&s;ly, while in exile in Cor&s;ica.
&startq;Yes, &s;aid Dr. John&s;on, and he was not farther
from home than we are.&endq; The truth is, he was
much nearer.</P>
<P>There was a good deal of rain to-day, and
the wind was &s;till contrary. Corneck attended
me, while I amu&s;ed my&s;elf in examining a col|lection
of papers belonging to the family of
Col. The fir&s;t laird was a younger &s;on of the
Chieftain M'Lean, and got the middle part of
Col for his patrimony. Dr. John&s;on having
given a very particular account of the con|nection
between this family and a branch of
the family of Camerons, called M'Lonich, I
&s;hall only in&s;ert the following document,
(which I found in Col's cabinet,) as a proof of
its continuance, even to a late period:
<LETTER>

<P>I found &s;everal letters to the late Col, from
my father's old companion at Paris, Sir Hector
M'Lean, one of which was written at the time
of &s;ettling the colony in Georgia. It di&s;&s;uades
Col from letting people go there, and a&s;&s;ures
him there will &s;oon be an opportunity of em|ploying
them better at home. Hence it ap|pears
<PB N="372" REF="378">
that emigration from the Highlands,
though not in &s;uch numbers at a time as of
late, has always been practi&s;ed. Dr. John&s;on
ob&s;erved, that, &startq;in&s;tead of improving their
country, they dimini&s;hed their people.&endq;</P>
<P>There are &s;everal di&s;tricts of &s;andy de&s;art in
Col. There are forty-eight lochs of fre&s;h
water; but many of them are very &s;mall,&mdash;
mere pools. About one half of them, how|ever,
have trout and eel. There is a great
number of hor&s;es in the i&s;land, mo&s;tly of a &s;mall
&s;ize. Being over-&s;tocked, they &s;ell &s;ome in
Tir-yi, and on the main land. Their black
cattle, which are chiefly rough-harired, are
reckoned remarkably good. The climate
being very mild in winter, they never put
their bea&s;ts in any hou&s;e. The lakes are
never frozen &s;o as to bear a man; and &s;now
never lies above a few hours. They have a
good many &s;heep, which they eat mo&s;tly them|&s;elves,
and &s;ell but a few. They have goats in
&s;everal places. There are no foxes; no &s;erpents,
toads, or frogs, nor any venomous creature.
They have otters and mice here; but had no
rats, till lately that an American ve&s;&s;el
brought them. There is a rabbit-warren on
the north ea&s;t of the i&s;land, belonging to the
Duke of Argyll. Young Col intends to get
&s;ome hares, of which there are none at pre&s;ent.
There are no black-cock, muir-fowl, nor par|tridges;
<PB N="373" REF="379">
but there are &s;nipe, wild-duck, wild|gee&s;e,
and &s;wans, in winter; wild pigeons, plo|ver,
and great numbers of &s;tarlings; of which I
&s;hot &s;ome, and found them pretty good eating.
Woodcocks come hither, though there is not a
tree upon the i&s;land. There are no rivers in
Col; but only &s;ome brooks, in which there is a
great variety of fi&s;h. In the whole i&s;le there are
but three hills, and none of them con&s;iderable,
for a Highland country. The people are very
indu&s;trious. Every man can tan. They get oak,
and birch-bark, and lime, from the main land.
Some have pits; but they commonly u&s;e tubs.
I &s;aw brogues very well tanned; and every man
can make them. They all make candles of
the tallow of their bea&s;ts, both moulded and
dipped; and they all make oil of the livers of
fi&s;h. The little fi&s;h called Cuddies produce a
great deal. They &s;ell &s;ome oil out of the
i&s;land, and they u&s;e it much for light in their
hou&s;es, in little iron lamps, mo&s;t of which they
have from England; but of late their own
black&s;mith makes them. He is a good work|man;
but he has no employment in &s;hoeing
hor&s;es, for they all go un&s;hod here, except &s;ome
of a better kind belonging to young Col,
which were now in Mull. There are two car|penters
in Col; but mo&s;t of the inhabitants
can do &s;omething as boat-carpenters. They
can all dye. Heath is u&s;ed for yellow; and
<PB N="374" REF="380">
for red, a mo&s;s which grows on &s;tones. They
make broad-cloth, and tartan and linen, of
their own wool and flax, &s;ufficient for their
own u&s;e; as al&s;o &s;tockings. Their bonnets
come from the main land. Hard-ware and
&s;everal &s;mall articles are brought annually from
Greenock, and &s;old in the only &s;hop in the
i&s;land, which is kept near the hou&s;e, or rather
hut, u&s;ed for publick wor&s;hip, there being no
church in the i&s;land.&mdash;The inhabitants of Col
have increa&s;ed con&s;iderably within the&s;e thirty
years, as appears from the pari&s;h regi&s;ters.
There are but three con&s;iderable tack&s;men on
Col's part of the i&s;land: the re&s;t is let to
&s;mall tenants, &s;ome of whom pay &s;o low a rent
as four, three, or even two guineas. The
highe&s;t is &s;even pounds, paid by a farmer,
who&s;e &s;on goes yearly on foot to Aberdeen for
education, and in &s;ummer returns, and acts as
a &s;chool-ma&s;ter in Col. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid,
&startq;There is &s;omething noble in a young man's
walking two hundred miles and back again,
every year, for the &s;ake of learning.&endq;</P>
<P>This day a number of people came to Col,
with complaints of each other's tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.
Corneck, to prevent their being trouble&s;ome,
told them, that the lawyer from Edinburgh
was here, and, if they did not agree, he would
take them to ta&s;k. They were alarmed at this;
&s;aid they had never been u&s;ed to go to law,
<PB N="375" REF="381">
and hoped Col would &s;ettle matters him&s;elf.&mdash;
In the evening Corneck left us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>9th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>As, in our pre&s;ent confinement, any thing
that had even the name of curious was an ob|ject
of attention, I propo&s;ed that Col &s;hould
&s;how me the great &s;tone, mentioned in a for|mer
page, as having been thrown by a giant
to the top of a mountain. Dr. John&s;on, who
did not like to be left alone, &s;aid he would
accompany us as far as riding was practicable.
We a&s;cended a part of the hill on hor&s;eback,
and Col and I &s;crambled up the re&s;t. A &s;er|vant
held our hor&s;es, and Dr. John&s;on placed
him&s;elf on the ground, with his back again&s;t a
large fragment of rock. The wind being high,
he let down the cocks of his hat, and tied it
with his handkerchief under his chin. While
we were employed in examining the &s;tone,
which did not repay our trouble in getting to
it, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf with reading Gataker <HI>on
Lots and on the Chri&s;tian Watch,</HI> a very learned
book, of the la&s;t age, which had been found
in the garret of Col's hou&s;e, and which he &s;aid
was a trea&s;ure here. When we de&s;cried him
from above, he had a mo&s;t eremitical appear|ance;
and on our return told, us, he had been
&s;o much engaged by Gataker, that he had
never mi&s;&s;ed us. His avidity for a variety of
books, while we were in Col, was frequently
<PB N="376" REF="382">
expre&s;&s;ed; and he often complained that &s;o few
were within his reach. Upon which I ob&s;erved
to him, that it was &s;trange he &s;hould complain
of want of books, when he could at any time
make &s;uch good ones.</P>
<P>We next proceeded to the lead mine. In
our way we came to a &s;trand of &s;ome extent,
where we were glad to take a gallop, in which
my learned friend joined with great alacrity.
Dr. John&s;on, mounted on a large bay mare
without &s;hoes, and followed by a foal, which
had &s;ome difficulty in keeping up with him,
was a &s;ingular &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>After examining the mine, we returned
through a very uncouth di&s;trict, full of &s;and
hills; down which, though apparent precipices,
our hor&s;es carried us with &s;afety, the &s;and al|ways
gently &s;liding away from their feet.
Ve&s;tiges of hou&s;es were pointed out to us,
which Col, and two others who had joined us,
a&s;&s;erted had been overwhelmed by &s;and blown
over them. But, on going clo&s;e to one of
them, Dr. John&s;on &s;hewed the ab&s;urdity of the
notion, by remarking, that &startq;it was evidently
only a hou&s;e abandoned, the &s;tones of which
had been taken away for other purpo&s;es; for
the large &s;tones, which form the lower part
of the walls, were &s;till &s;tanding higher than
the &s;and. If <HI>they</HI> were not blown over,
it was clear nothing higher than they could be
blown over.&endq; This was quite convincing to
<PB N="377" REF="383">
me; but it made not the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on
Col and the others, who were not to be argued
out of a Highland tradition.</P>
<P>We did not &s;it down to dinner till between
&s;ix and &s;even. We lived plentifully here, and
had a true welcome. In &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, good
firing was of no &s;mall importance. The peats
were excellent, and burnt cheerfully. Tho&s;e
at Dunvegan, which were damp, Dr. John&s;on
called &startq;a &s;ullen fuel.&endq;</P>
<P>Blenheim being occa&s;ionally mentioned, he
told me he had never &s;een it: he had not gone
formerly; and he would not go now ju&s;t as a
common &s;pectator, for his money: he would
not put it in the power of &s;ome man about the
Duke of Marlborough to &s;ay, &startq;John&s;on was
here; I knew him, but I took no notice of
him.&endq; He &s;aid, he would be very glad to &s;ee
it, if properly invited, which in all probability
would never be the ca&s;e, as it was not worth
his while to &s;eek for it.&mdash;I ob&s;erved, that he
might be ea&s;ily introduced there by a common
friend of ours, nearly related to the duke. He
an&s;wered, with an uncommon attention to de|licacy
of feeling, &startq;I doubt whether our friend
be on &s;uch a footing with the duke as to carry
any body there; and I would not give him the
unea&s;ine&s;s of &s;eeing that I knew he was not, or
even of being him&s;elf reminded of it.&endq;</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="378" REF="384">
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>10th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>There was this day the mo&s;t terrible &s;torm
of wind and rain that I ever remember. It
made &s;uch an awful impre&s;&s;ion on us all, as to
produce, for &s;ome time, a kind of di&s;mal quiet|ne&s;s
in the hou&s;e. The day was pa&s;&s;ed without
much conver&s;ation: only, upon my ob&s;erving
that there mu&s;t be &s;omething bad in a man's
mind, who does not like to give lea&s;es to his
tenants, but wi&s;hes to keep them in a perpe|tual
wretched dependence on his will, Dr.
John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;You are right: it is a man's
duty to extend comfort and &s;ecurity among as
many people as he can. He &s;hould not wi&s;h to
have his tenanants mere <HI>Ephemerae,</HI>&mdash;mere be|ings
of an hour.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;But, &s;ir, if they
have lea&s;es, is there not &s;ome danger that they
may grow in&s;olent? I remember you your&s;elf
once told me, an Engli&s;h tenant was &s;o
independent, that, if provoked, he would <HI>throw</HI>
his rent at his landlord.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Depend
upon it,&endq; &s;ir, it is the landlord's own fault, if it
is thrown at him. A man may always keep
his tenants under dependence enough, though
they have lea&s;es. He mu&s;t be a good tenant,
indeed, who will not fall behind in his rent, if
his landlord will let him; and if he does not
fall behind, his landlord has him at his mercy.
Indeed, the poor man is always much at the
<PB N="379" REF="385">
&startq;mercy of the rich; no matter whether landlord
or tenant. If the tenant lets his landlord have
a little rent before-hand, or has lent him
money, then the landlord is in his power.
There cannot be a greater man than a tenant
who has lent money to his landlord; for he
has under &s;ubjection the very man to whom he
&s;hould be &s;ubjected.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>11th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We had &s;ome days ago engaged the Camp|belltown
ve&s;&s;el to carry us to Mull, from the
harbour where &s;he lay. The morning was fine,
and the wind fair and moderate; &s;o we hoped
at length to get away.</P>
<P>Mrs. M'Sweyn, who officiated as our land|lady
here, had never been on the main land.
On hearing this, Dr. John&s;on &s;aid to me,
before her, &startq;That is rather being behind-hand
with life. I would at lea&s;t go and &s;ee Glenelg.&endq;
&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;You your&s;elf, &s;ir, have never

<P>We &s;et out about eleven for the harbour;
but, before we reached it, &s;o violent a &s;torm
<PB N="380" REF="386">
came on, that we were obliged again to take
&s;helter in the hou&s;e of Captain M'Lean, where
we dined, and pa&s;&s;ed the night.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tue&s;day, <DATE>12th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, we made a &s;econd attempt
to get to the harbour; but another &s;torm &s;oon
convinced us that it would be in vain. Cap|tain
M'Lean's hou&s;e being in &s;ome confu&s;ion,
on account of Mrs. M'Lean's being expected
to lie-in, we re&s;olved to go to Mr. M'Sweyn's,
where we arrived very wet, fatigued, and
hungry. In this &s;ituation, we were &s;omewhat
di&s;concerted by being told that we &s;hould
have no dinner till late in the evening; but
&s;hould have tea in the mean time. Dr. John&s;on
oppo&s;ed this arrangement; but they per&s;i&s;ted,
and he took the tea very readily. He &s;aid to
me afterwards, &startq;You mu&s;t con&s;ider, &s;ir, a
dinner here is a matter of great con&s;equence.
It is a thing to be fir&s;t planned, and then exe|cuted.
I &s;uppo&s;e the mutton was brought
&s;ome miles off, from &s;ome place where they
knew there was a &s;heep killed.&endq;</P>
<P>Talking of the good people with whom we
were, he &s;aid, &startq;Life has not got at all for|ward
by a generation in M'Sweyn's family;
for the &s;on is exactly formed upon the father.
What the father &s;ays, the &s;on &s;ays; and what
the father looks, the &s;on looks.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="387">
There being little conver&s;ation to-night, I
mu&s;t endeavour to recollect what I may have
ommitted on former occa&s;ions.&mdash;When I boa&s;ted,
at Ra&s;ay, of my independency of &s;pirit, and
that I could not be bribed, he &s;aid, &startq;Yes, you
may be bribed by flattery.&endq;&mdash;At the Reverend
Mr. M'Lean's, Dr. John&s;on a&s;ked him, if the
people of Col had any &s;uper&s;titions. He &s;aid,
&startq;No.&endq; The cutting peats at the increa&s;e of
the moon was mentioned as one; but he would
not allow it, &s;aying, it was not a &s;uper&s;tition,
but a whim. Dr. John&s;on would not admit the
di&s;tinction. There were many &s;uper&s;titions, he
maintained, not connected with religion; and
this was one of them.&mdash;On Monday we had a
di&s;pute at the Captain's, whether &s;and-hills
could be fixed down by art. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid,
&startq;How <HI>the devil</HI> can you do it?&endq; but in&s;tantly
corrected him&s;elf, &startq;How can you do it?&endq;&mdash;I
never before heard him u&s;e a phra&s;e of that
nature.</P>
<P>He has particularities which it is impo&s;&s;ible
to explain. He never wears a night-cap, as I
have already mentioned; but he puts a hand|kerchief
on his head in the night.&mdash;The day
that we left Tali&s;ker, he bade us ride on. He
then turned the head of his hor&s;e back towards
Tali&s;ker, &s;topped for &s;ome time; then wheeled
round to the &s;ame direction with ours, and then
came bri&s;kly after us. He &s;ets open a window
in the colde&s;t day or night, and &s;tands before it.
<PB N="382" REF="388">
It may do with his con&s;titution; but mo&s;t
people, among&s;t whom I am one, would &s;ay,
with the frogs in the fable, &startq;This may be
&s;port to you; but it is death to us.&endq;&mdash;It is
in vain to try to find a meaning in every one
of his particularities, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, are mere
habits, contracted by chance; of which every
man has &s;ome that are more or le&s;s remark|able.
His &s;peaking to him&s;elf, or rather re|peating,
is a common habit with &s;tudious men
accu&s;tomed to deep thinking; and, in con&s;e|quence
of their being thus rapt, they will even
laugh by them&s;elves, if the &s;ubject which they
are mu&s;ing on is a merry one. Dr. John&s;on
is often uttering pious ejaculations, when he
appears to be talking to him&s;elf; for &s;ometimes
his voice grows &s;tronger, and parts of the
Lord's Prayer are heard. I have &s;at be&s;ide
him with more than ordinary reverence on &s;uch
occa&s;ions<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, that Dr. John&s;on &s;hould have read this account of &s;ome of his own peculiar habits, without &s;aying any thing on the &s;ubject, which I hoped he would have done.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In our Tour, I ob&s;erved that he was di&s;gu&s;ted
whenever he met with coar&s;e manners. He
&s;aid to me, &startq;I know not how it is,&endq; but I can|not
bear low life: and I find others, who have
as good a righ: as I to be fa&s;tidious, bear it

mixed pretty well too.</P>

he had &s;aid, and he corrected any mi&s;takes that
I had made. &startq;They call me a &s;cholar, &s;aid he,
and yet how very little literature is there in my
conver&s;ation.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;That, &s;ir, mu&s;t be
according to your company. You would not
give literature to tho&s;e who cannot ta&s;te it.

<P>We had at la&s;t a good dinner, or rather

<HEAD>Wedne&s;day, <DATE>13th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Col called me up, with intelligence that it
was a good day for a pa&s;&s;age to Mull; and ju&s;t
as we ro&s;e, a &s;ailor from the ve&s;&s;el arrived for
us. We got all ready with di&s;patch. Dr.
John&s;on was di&s;plea&s;ed at my bu&s;tling, and
walking quickly up and down. He &s;aid, &startq;It
does not ha&s;ten us a bit. It is getting on
hor&s;eback in a &s;hip. All boys do it; and you
are longer a boy than others.&endq; He him&s;elf has
no alertne&s;s, or whatever it may be called; &s;o
he may di&s;like it, as <HI>Oderunt hilarem tri&s;tes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="390">
Before we reached the harbour, the wind
grew high again. However, the &s;mall boat
was waiting, and took us on board. We re|mained
for &s;ome time in uncertainty what to
do: at la&s;t it was determined, that, as a good
part of the day was over, and it was dangerous
to be at &s;ea at night, in &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el, and &s;uch
weather, we &s;hould not &s;ail till the morning
tide, when the wind would probably be more
gentle. We re&s;olved not to go a&s;hore again,
but lie here in readine&s;s. Dr. John&s;on and I
had each a bed in the cabbin. Col &s;at at the
fire in the foreca&s;tle, with the captain, and
Jo&s;eph, and the re&s;t. I eat &s;ome dry oatmeal,
of which I found a barrel in the cabbin. I had
not done this &s;ince I was a boy. Dr. John&s;on
owned that he too was fond of it when a boy;
a circum&s;tance which I was highly plea&s;ed to
hear from him, as it gave me an opportunity
of ob&s;erving that, notwith&s;tanding his joke on
the article of OATS, he was him&s;elf a proof
that this kind of <HI>food</HI> was not peculiar to the
people of Scotland.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Thur&s;day, <DATE>14th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>When Dr. John&s;on awaked this morning,
he called, &startq;<HI>Lanky!</HI>&endq; having, I &s;uppo&s;e, been
thinking of Langton; but corrected him&s;elf
in&s;tantly, and cried, &startq;<HI>Bozzy!</HI>&endq; He has a way
of contracting the names of his friends. Gold|&s;mith
<PB N="385" REF="391">
feels him&s;elf &s;o important now, as to be
di&s;plea&s;ed at it. I remember one day, when
Tom Davies was telling that Dr. John&s;on &s;aid,
&startq;We are all in labour for a name to <HI>Goldy's</HI>
play,&endq; Gold&s;mith cried, &startq;I have often de&s;ired
him not to call me <HI>Goldy.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>Between &s;ix and &s;even we hauled our anchor,
and &s;et &s;ail with a fair breeze; and, after a
plea&s;ant voyage, we got &s;afely and agreeably
into the harbour of Tobermorie, before the
wind ro&s;e, which it always has done, for &s;ome
days, about noon.</P>
<P>Tobermorie is an excellent harbour. An i&s;land
lies before it, and it is &s;urrounded by a hilly
theatre. The i&s;land is too low, otherwi&s;e this
would be quite a &s;ecure port; but, as the i&s;land
is not high enough, &s;ome &s;torms blow very
hard here. Not long ago, fifteen ve&s;&s;els
were blown from their moorings. There are
&s;ometimes &s;ixty or &s;eventy &s;ail here: to-day
there were twelve or fourteen ve&s;&s;els. To &s;ee
&s;uch a fleet was the next thing to &s;eeing a town.
The ve&s;&s;els were from different places; Clyde,
Campbelltown, Newca&s;tle, &amp;c. One was return|ing
to Lanca&s;ter from Hamburgh. After
having been &s;hut up &s;o long in Col, the &s;ight
of &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of moving habitations,
containing &s;uch a variety of people, engaged in
different pur&s;uits, gave me much gaiety of &s;pi|rit.
When we had landed, Dr. John&s;on &s;aid,
<PB N="386" REF="392">
&startq;Bo&s;well is now all alive. He is like Antaeus;
he gets new vigour whenever he touches the
ground.&endq;&mdash;I went to the top of a hill fronting
the harbour, from whence I had a good view
of it. We had here a tolerable inn. Dr. John|&s;on
had owned to me this morning, that he was
out or humour. Indeed, he &s;hewed it a good
deal in the &s;hip; for when I was expre&s;&s;ing my
joy on the pro&s;pect of our landing in Mull, he
&s;aid, he had no joy, when he recollected that it
would be five days before he &s;hould get to the
main land. I was afraid he would now take a
&s;udden re&s;olution to give up &s;eeing Icolmkill.
A di&s;h of tea, and &s;ome good bread and butter,
did him &s;ervice, and his bad humour went off.
I told him, that I was diverted to hear all the
people whom we had vi&s;ited in our Tour, &s;ay,
&startq;<HI>Hone&s;t man!</HI> he's plea&s;ed with every thing;
he's always content!&endq;&mdash;&startq;Little do they know,&endq;
&s;aid I. He laughed, and &s;aid, &startq;You rogue!&endq;</P>
<P>We &s;ent to hire hor&s;es to carry us acro&s;s the
i&s;land of Mull to the &s;hore oppo&s;ite to Inch|kenneth,
the re&s;idence of Sir Allan M'Lean,
uncle to young Col, and Chief of the M'Leans,
to who&s;e hou&s;e we intended to go the next
morning. Our friend Col went to vi&s;it his
aunt, the wife of Dr. Alexander M'Lean, a
phy&s;ician, who lives about a mile from Tober|morie.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="393">
Dr. John&s;on and I &s;at by our&s;elves at the inn,
and talked a good deal.&mdash;I told him, that I
had found, in Leandro Alberti's De&s;cription
of Italy, a good deal of what Addi&s;on has
given us in his <HI>Remarks.</HI> He &s;aid, &startq;The
collection of pa&s;&s;ages from the Cla&s;&s;icks has been
made by another Italian: it is, howeever, im|po&s;&s;ible
to detect a man as a plagiary in &s;uch a
ca&s;e, becau&s;e all who &s;et about making &s;uch
a collection mu&s;t find the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ages; but
if you find the &s;ame application in another
book, then Addi&s;on's learning in his <HI>Remarks</HI>
tumbles down. It is a tedious book; and, if
it were not attached to Addi&s;on's previous re|putation,
one would not think much of it.
Had he written nothing el&s;e, his name would
not have lived. Addi&s;on does not &s;eem to have
gone deep in Italian literature: he &s;hews no|thing
of it in his &s;ub&s;equent writings. He
&s;hews a great deal of French learning.&mdash;There
is, perhaps, more knowledge circulated in the
French language than in any other. There is
more original knowledge in Engli&s;h.&endq;&mdash;&startq;But
the French (&s;aid I) have the art of accommo|dating
literature.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Yes, &s;ir; we
have no &s;uch book as Moreri's Dictionary.&endq;&mdash;
<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;Their <HI>Ana</HI> are good.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;A
few of them are good; but we have one book
of that kind better than any of them; Selden's
<HI>Table-talk.</HI> As to original literature, the
<PB N="388" REF="394">
French have a couple of tragick poets who go
round the world, <HI>Racine</HI> and <HI>Corneille,</HI> and one
comick poet, <HI>Moliere.</HI>&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;They have
<HI>Fenelon.</HI>&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why, &s;ir, <HI>Telemachus</HI> is

<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;He has not &s;tood his trial yet. And

would not allow <HI>Ma&s;&s;illon</HI> and <HI>Bourdaloue</HI> to
go round the world. In general, however, he
gave the French much prai&s;e for their in|du&s;try.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked me whether he had mentioned, in
any of the papers of the <HI>Rambler,</HI> the de&s;crip|tion
in Virgil of the entrance into Hell, with
an application to the pre&s;s; &startq;for (&s;aid he) I do
not much remember them.&endq; I told him, &startq;No.&endq;

<PB N="389" REF="395">
&startq;a printing-hou&s;e.&endq; I propo&s;ed to him to dic|tate
an e&s;&s;ay on it, and offered to write it. He
&s;aid, he would not do it then, but perhaps
would write one at &s;ome future period.</P>
<P>The Sunday evening that we &s;at by our&s;elves
at Aberdeen, I a&s;ked him &s;everal particulars of
his life, from his early years, which he readily
told me; and I wrote them down before him.
This day I proceeded in my inquiries, al&s;o
writing them in his pre&s;ence. I have them on
detached &s;heets. I &s;hall collect authentick ma|terials
for THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON,
LL. D.; and, if I &s;urvive him, I &s;hall be one
who will mo&s;t faithfully do honour to his me|mory.
I have now a va&s;t trea&s;ure of his con|ver&s;ation,
at different times, &s;ince the year 1762,
when I fir&s;t obtained his acquaintance; and,
by a&s;&s;iduos inquiry, I can make up for not
knowing him &s;ooner<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to me to reflect, that Dr. John&s;on read this, and, after being apprized of my intention, commu|nicated to me, at &s;ub&s;equent periods, many particulars of his life, which probably could not otherwi&s;e have been pre&s;erved.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A Newca&s;tle &s;hip-ma&s;ter, who happened to
be in the hou&s;e, intruded him&s;elf upon us. He
was much in liquor, and talked non&s;en&s;e about
his being a man for <HI>Wilkes and Liberty,</HI> and
again&s;t the mini&s;try. Dr. John&s;on was angry,
that &startq;a fellow &s;hould come into <HI>our</HI> company,
who was fit for <HI>no</HI> company.&endq; He left us &s;oon.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="396">
Col returned from his aunt, and told us, &s;he
in&s;i&s;ted that we &s;hould come to her hou&s;e that
night. He introduced to us Mr. Campbell,
the Duke of Argyle's factor in Tyr-yi. He
was a genteel, agreeable man. He was going
to Inveraray, and promi&s;ed to put letters into
the po&s;t-office for us. I now found that Dr.
John&s;on's de&s;ire to get on the main land, aro&s;e
from his anxiety to have an opportunity of
conveying letters to his friends.</P>
<P>After dinner, we proceeded to Dr. M'Lean's,
which was about a mile from our inn. He
was not at home, but we were received by his
lady and daughter, who entertained us &s;o well,
that Dr. John&s;on &s;eemed quite happy. When
we had &s;upped, he a&s;ked me to give him &s;ome
paper to write letters. I begged he would
write &s;hort ones, and not <HI>expatiate,</HI> as we &s;hould
&s;et off early. He was irritated by this, and
&s;aid, &startq;What mu&s;t be done, mu&s;t be done;
the thing is pa&s;t a joke.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Nay, &s;ir, &s;aid I,
write as much as you plea&s;e; but do not blame
me, if we are kept &s;ix days before we get to the
main land. You was very impatient in the
morning; but no &s;ooner do you find your&s;elf
in good quarters, than you forget that you are
to move.&endq; I got him paper enough, and we
parted in good humour.</P>
<P>Let me now recollect whatever particulars I
have omitted.&mdash;In the morning I &s;aid to him,
<PB N="391" REF="397">
before we landed at Tobermorie, &startq;We &s;hall
&s;ee Dr. M'Lean, who has written the Hi&s;tory
of the M'Leans.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;I have no great
patience to &s;tay to hear the hi&s;tory of the
M'Leans. I would rather hear the Hi&s;tory of
the Thrales.&endq;&mdash;When on Mull, I &s;aid, &startq;Well,
&s;ir, this is the fourth of the Hebrides that we
have been upon.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Nay, we cannot
boa&s;t of the number we have &s;een. We thought of
&s;ailing about ea&s;ily from i&s;land to i&s;land; and
&s;o we &s;hould, had we come at a better &s;ea&s;on;
but we, being wi&s;e men, thought it would be
&s;ummer all the year where <HI>we</HI> were. However,
&s;ir, we have &s;een enough to give us a pretty
good notion of the &s;y&s;tem of in&s;ular life.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Let me not forget, that he &s;ometimes amu&s;ed
him&s;elf with very &s;light reading; from which,
however, his conver&s;ation &s;hewed that he con|trived
to extract &s;ome benefit. At Captain
M'Lean's, he read a good deal in <HI>The Charmer,</HI>
a collection of &s;ongs.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>15th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We this morning found that we could not
proceed, there being a violent &s;torm of wind
and rain, and the rivers being impa&s;&s;able.
When I expre&s;&s;ed my di&s;content at our con|finement,
Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;Now that I
have had an opportunity of writing to the main
land, I am in no &s;uch ha&s;te.&endq; I was amu&s;ed
<PB N="392" REF="398">
with his being &s;o ea&s;ily &s;atisfied; for the truth
was, that the gentleman who was to convey
our letters, as I was now informed, was not
to &s;et out for Inveraray for &s;ome time; &s;o that
it was probable we &s;hould be there as &s;oon as
he: however, I did not undeceive my friend,
but &s;uffered him to enjoy his fancy.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on a&s;ked, in the evening, to &s;ee
Dr. M'Lean's books. He took down Willis
<HI>de Anima Brutorum,</HI> and pored over it a good deal.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s M'Lean produced &s;ome Er&s;e poems by
John M'Lean, who was a famous bard in
Mull, and had died only a few years ago. He
could neither read nor write. She read and
tran&s;lated two of them; one, a kind of elegy
on Sir John M'Lean's being obliged to fly his
country in 1715; another, a dialogue between
two Roman Catholick young ladies, &s;i&s;ters,
whether it was better to be a nun or to marry.
I could not perceive much poetical imagery in
the tran&s;lation. Yet all of our company who
under&s;tood Er&s;e, &s;eemed charmed with the
original. There may, perhaps, be &s;ome choice
of expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ome excellence of arrange|ment,
that cannot be &s;hewn in tran&s;lation.</P>
<P>After we had exhau&s;ted the Er&s;e poems,
of which Dr. John&s;on &s;aid nothing, Mi&s;s
M'Lean gave us &s;everal tunes on a &s;pinnet,
which, though made &s;o long ago, as in 1667,
was &s;till very well toned. She &s;ung along with
it. Dr. John&s;on &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the
<PB N="393" REF="399">
mu&s;ick, though he owns he neither likes it,
nor has hardly any perception of it. At Mr.
M'Pher&s;on's, in Slate, he told us that &startq;he knew
a drum from a trumpet, and a bagpipe from a
guittar, which was about the extent of his
knowledge of mu&s;ick.&endq; To-night he &s;aid, that,
&startq;if he had learnt mu&s;ick, he &s;hould have been
afraid he would have done nothing el&s;e than
play. It was a method of employing the mind,
without the labour of thinking at all, and with
&s;ome applau&s;e from a man's &s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>We had the mu&s;ick of the bagpipe every
day, at Armidale, Dunvegan, and Col. Dr.
John&s;on appeared fond of it, and u&s;ed often to
&s;tand for &s;ome time with his ear clo&s;e to the
great drone.</P>
<P>The penurious gentleman of our acquaint|ance,
formerly alluded to, afforded us a topick of
conver&s;ation to-night. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, I ought
to write down a collection of the in&s;tances of
his narrowne&s;s, as they almo&s;t exceeded belief.
Col told us, that O'Kane, the famous Iri&s;h
harper, was once at that gentleman's hou&s;e.
He could not find in his heart to give him any
money, but gave him a key for a harp, which
was finely ornamented with gold and &s;ilver,
and with a precious &s;tone, and was worth
eighty or a hundred guineas. He did not
know the value of it; and when he came to
know it, he would fain have had it back; but
<PB N="394" REF="400">
Okane took care that he &s;hould not.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;They exaggerate the value; every body is
&s;o de&s;irous that he &s;hould be fleeced. I am very
willing it &s;hould be worth eighty or a hun|dred
guineas; but I do not believe it.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI>
&startq;I do not think O'Kane was obliged to give it
back.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, &s;ir. If a man with his
eyes open, and without any means u&s;ed to
deceive him, gives me a thing, I am not to
let him have it again when he grows wi&s;er. I
like to &s;ee how avarice defeats it&s;elf: how,
when avoiding to part with money, the mi&s;er
gives &s;omething more valuable.&endq;&mdash;Col &s;aid,
the gentleman's relations were angry at his
giving away the harp-key, for it had been long
in the family.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, he values a
new guinea more than an old friend.&endq;</P>
<P>Col al&s;o told us, that the &s;ame per&s;on having
come up with a &s;erjeant and twenty men,
working on the high road, he entered into di&s;|cour&s;e
with the &s;erjeant, and then gave him
&s;ixpence for the men to drink. The &s;erjeant
a&s;ked, &startq;Who is this fellow?&endq; Upon being
informed, he &s;aid, &startq;If I had known who he was,
I &s;hould have thrown it in his face.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI>
&startq;There is much want of &s;en&s;e in all this.
He had no bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;peak with the &s;erjeant.
He might have been in ha&s;te, and trotted on.
He has not learnt to be a mi&s;er: I believe we
mu&s;t take him apprentice.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;He
<PB N="395" REF="401">
would grudge giving half a guinea to be
taught.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Nay, &s;ir, you mu&s;t teach
him <HI>gratis.</HI> You mu&s;t give him an oppor|tunity
to practice your precepts.&endq;</P>
<P>Let me now go back, and glean <HI>John&s;oniana.</HI>
&mdash;The Saturday before we &s;ailed from Slate, I
&s;at awhile in the afternoon with Dr. John&s;on in
his room, in a quiet &s;erious frame. I ob&s;erved,
that hardly any man was accurately prepared
for dying; but almo&s;t every one left &s;omething
undone, &s;omething in confu&s;ion; that my
father, indeed, told me he knew one man,
(Carli&s;le of Limekilns,) after who&s;e death all
his papers were found in exact order; and
nothing was omitted in his will.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir,
I had an uncle who died &s;o; but &s;uch atten|tion
requires great lei&s;ure, and great firmne&s;s of
mind. If one was to think con&s;tantly of death,
the bu&s;ine&s;s of life would &s;tand &s;till. I am no
friend to making religion appear too hard.
Many good people have done harm, by giving
&s;evere notions of it. In the &s;ame way, as to
learning: I never frighten young people with
difficulties; on the contrary, I tell them that
they may very ea&s;ily get as much as will do
very well. I do not indeed tell them that they
will be <HI>Bentleys.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>The night we rode to Col's hou&s;e, I &s;aid,
&startq;Lord Elibank is probably wondering what is
become of us.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;No, no; he is not
<PB N="396" REF="402">
thinking of us.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;But recollect the
warmth with which he wrote. Are we not to
believe a man, when he &s;ays that he has a
great de&s;ire to &s;ee another? Don't you believe
that I was very impatient for your coming to
Scotland?&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Yes, &s;ir; I believe,
you was; and I was impatient to come to you.
A young man feels &s;o, but &s;eldom an old
man.&endq; I however convinced him that Lord
Elibank, who has much of the &s;pirit of a young
man, might feel &s;o.&mdash;He a&s;ked me if our jaunt
had an&s;wered expectation. I &s;aid it had much
exceeded it. I expected much difficulty with
him, and had not found it. &startq;And (he added)
wherever we have come, we have been received
like princes in their progre&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;aid, he would not wi&s;h not to be di&s;gu&s;ted
in the Highlands; for that would be to lo&s;e
the power of di&s;tingui&s;hing, and a man might
then lie down in the middle of them. He
wi&s;hed only to conceal his di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>At Captain M'Lean's, I mentioned Pope's
friend, Spence.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;He was a weak
conceited man.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;A good &s;cholar,
&s;ir?&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why, no, &s;ir.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI>
&startq;He was a pretty &s;cholar.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;You
have about reached him.&endq;</P>
<P>La&s;t night at the inn, when the factor in
Tyr-yi &s;poke of his having heard that a roof
was put on &s;ome part of the buildings at
<PB N="397" REF="403">
Icolmkill, I unluckily &s;aid, &startq;It will be for|tunate
if we find a cathedral with a roof on it.&endq;
I &s;aid this from a fooli&s;h anxiety to engage Dr.
John&s;on's curio&s;ity more. He took me &s;hort
at once. &startq;What, &s;ir? how can you talk &s;o?
If we &s;hall <HI>find</HI> a cathedral roofed! as if we were
going to a <HI>terra incognita:</HI> when every thing
that is at Icolmkill is &s;o well known. You are
like &s;ome New-England-men who came to the
mouth of the Thames. &startq;Come, &s;aid they, let
us go up and &s;ee what &s;ort of inhabitants there
are here.&endq; They talked, &s;ir, as if they had
been to go up the Su&s;quehannah, or any other
American river.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>16th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>This day there was a new moon, and the
weather changed for the better. Dr. John&s;on
&s;aid of Mi&s;s M'Lean, &startq;She is the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;hed
lady that I have found in the High|lands.
She knows French, mu&s;ick, and draw|ing,
&s;ews neatly, makes &s;hell-work, and can
milk cows; in &s;hort, &s;he can do every thing.
She talks &s;en&s;ibly, and is the fir&s;t per&s;on whom
I have found, that can tran&s;late Er&s;e poetry lite|rally.&endq;
&mdash;We &s;et out, mounted on little Mull
hor&s;es. Mull corre&s;ponded exactly with the
idea which I had always had of it; a hilly
country, diver&s;ified with heath and gra&s;s, and
many rivulets. Dr. John&s;on was not in very
<PB N="398" REF="404">
good humour. He &s;aid, it was a dreary country,
much wor&s;e than Sky. I differed from him.
&startq;O, &s;ir, (&s;aid he,) a mo&s;t dolorous country!&endq;</P>
<P>We had a very hard journey to-day. I had
no bridle for my &s;heltie, but only a halter; and
Jo&s;eph rode without a &s;addle. At one place,
a loch having &s;welled over the road, we were
obliged to plunge through pretty deep water.
Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved, how helple&s;s a man
would be, were he travelling here alone, and
&s;hould meet with any accident; and &s;aid, &startq;he
longed to get to <HI>a country of &s;addles and
bridles.</HI>&endq; He was more out of humour to-day,
than he has been in the cour&s;e of our Tour, be|ing
fretted to find that his little hor&s;e could
&s;carcely &s;upport his weight;&mdash;and having &s;uf|fered
a lo&s;s, which, though &s;mall in it&s;elf, was
of &s;ome con&s;equence to him, while travelling
the rugged &s;teeps of Mull, where he was at
times obliged to walk. The lo&s;s that I allude
to was that of the large oak-&s;tick, which, as I
formerly mentioned, he had brought with
him from London. It was of great u&s;e to him
in our wild peregrination; for, ever &s;ince his
la&s;t illne&s;s in 1766, he has had a weakne&s;s in his
knees, and not been able to walk ea&s;ily. It
had too the properties of a mea&s;ure; for one
nail was driven into it at the length of a foot;
another at that of a yard. In return for the
&s;ervices it had done him, he &s;aid, this morning,
<PB N="399" REF="405">
he would make a pre&s;ent of it to &s;ome Mu&s;eum;
but he little thought he was &s;o &s;oon to lo&s;e it.
As he preferred riding with a &s;witch, it was en|tru&s;ted
to a fellow to be delivered to our bag|gage-man,
who followed us at &s;ome di&s;tance;
but we never &s;aw it more. I could not per|&s;uade
him out of a &s;u&s;picion that it had
been &s;tolen. &startq;No, no, my friend, (&s;aid he,)
it is not to be expected that any man in Mull,
who has got it, will part with it. Con&s;ider, &s;ir,
the value of &s;uch a <HI>piece of timber</HI> here!&endq;</P>
<P>As we travelled this forenoon, we met Dr.
M'Lean, who expre&s;&s;ed much regret at his
having been &s;o unfortunate as to be ab&s;ent
while we were at his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We were in hopes to get to Sir Allan Mac|lean's,
at Inchkenneth, to-night; but the eight
miles, of which our road was &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t,
were &s;o very long, that we did not reach the
oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Mull till &s;even at night,
though we had &s;et out about eleven in the
forenoon; and when we did arrive there, we
found the wind &s;trong again&s;t us. Col deter|mined
that we &s;hould pa&s;s the night at
M'Quarrie's, in the i&s;land of Ulva, which lies
between Mull and Inchkenneth; and a &s;ervant
was &s;ent forward to the ferry, to &s;ecure the boat
for us: but the boat was gone to the Ulva &s;ide,
and the wind was &s;o high that the people could
not hear him call; and the night &s;o dark that
<PB N="400" REF="406">
they could not &s;ee a &s;ignal. We &s;hould have
been in a very bad &s;ituation, had there not for|tunately
been lying in the little &s;ound of Ulva
an Iri&s;h ve&s;&s;el, the Bonnetta, of Londonderry,
Captain M'Lure, ma&s;ter. He him&s;elf was at
M'Quarrie's; but his men obligingly came
with their long-boat, and ferried us over.</P>
<P>M'Quarrie's hou&s;e was mean; but we were
agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed with the appearance of the
ma&s;ter, whom we found to be intelligent, po|lite,
and much a man of the world. Though
his clan is not numerous, he is a very ancient
Chief, and has a burial-place at Icolmkill. He
told us, his family had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Ulva for nine
hundred years; but I was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to hear that
it was &s;oon to be &s;old for payment of his debts.</P>
<P>Captain M'Lure, whom we found here, was
of Scotch extraction, and properly a M'Leod,
being de&s;cended of &s;ome of the M'Leods who
went with Sir Normand of Bernera to the battle
of Worce&s;ter; and, after the defeat of the
royali&s;ts, fled to Ireland, and, to conceal them|&s;elves,
took a different name. He told me,
there was a great number of them about Lon|donderry;
&s;ome of good property. I &s;aid, they
&s;hould now re&s;ume their real name. The Laird
of M'Leod &s;hould go over, and a&s;&s;emble them,
and make them all drink the large horn full,
and from that time they &s;hould be M'Leods.&mdash;
The captain informed us, he had named his &s;hip
<PB N="401" REF="407">
the Bonnetta, out of gratitude to Providence;
for once, when he was &s;ailing to America with
a good number of pa&s;&s;engers, the &s;hip in which
he then &s;ailed was becalmed for five weeks, and
during all that time, numbers of the fi&s;h Bon|netta
&s;wam clo&s;e to her, and were catched for
food; he re&s;olved therefore that the &s;hip he
&s;hould next get &s;hould be called the Bonnetta.</P>
<P>M'Quarrie told us a &s;trong in&s;tance of the
&s;econd &s;ight. He had gone to Edinburgh, and
taken a man-&s;ervant along with him. An old
woman, who was in the hou&s;e, &s;aid one day,
&startq;M'Quarrie will be at home to-morrow, and
will bring two gentlemen with him;&endq; and &s;he
&s;aid, &s;he &s;aw his &s;ervant return in red and green.
He did come home next day. He had two
gentlemen with him; and his &s;ervant had a
new red and green livery, which M'Quarrie
had bought for him at Edinburgh, upon a
&s;udden thought, not having had the lea&s;t inten|tion
when he left home to put his &s;ervant in
livery; &s;o that the old woman could not have
heard any previous mention of it. This, he
a&s;&s;ured us, was a true &s;tory.</P>
<P>M'Quarrie in&s;i&s;ted that the <HI>Mercheta Mulie|rum,</HI>
mentioned in our old charters, did really
mean the privilege which a lord of a manor, or a
baron, had, to have the fir&s;t night of all his va&s;|&s;als'
wives. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, the belief of &s;uch a
cu&s;tom having exi&s;ted was al&s;o held in England,
<PB N="402" REF="408">
where there is a tenure called <HI>Borough-Engli&s;h,</HI>
by which the elde&s;t child does not inherit, from
a doubt of his being the &s;on of the tenant.
M'Quarrie told us, that &s;till, on the marriage
of each of his tenants, a &s;heep is due to him;
for which the compo&s;ition is fixed at five &s;hil|lings.
I &s;uppo&s;e, Ulva is the only place where
this cu&s;tom remains.</P>
<P>Talking of the &s;ale of an e&s;tate of an ancient
family, which was &s;aid to have been purcha&s;ed
much under its value by the confidential lawyer
of that family, and it being mentioned that the
&s;ale would probably be &s;et a&s;ide by a &s;uit in
equity, Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;I am very willing
that this &s;ale &s;hould be &s;et a&s;ide, but I doubt
much whether the &s;uit will be &s;ucce&s;sful; for
the argument for avoiding the &s;ale is founded
on vague and indeterminate principles,&mdash;as that
the price was too low, and that there was a
great degree of confidence placed by the &s;eller
in the per&s;on who became the purcha&s;er. Now
how low &s;hould a price be? or what degree of
confidence &s;hould there be to make a bargain
be &s;et a&s;ide? a bargain, which is a wager of
&s;kill between man and man.&mdash;If, indeed, any
fraud can be proved, that will do.&endq;</P>
<P>When Dr. John&s;on and I were by our&s;elves
at night, I ob&s;erved of our ho&s;t, &startq;<HI>a&s;pectum ge|nero&s;um
habet:&endq;&mdash;&startq;et genero&s;um animum,</HI>&endq; he
added.&mdash;For fear of being overheard in the
<PB N="403" REF="409">
&s;mall Highland hou&s;es, I often talked to him
in &s;uch Latin as I could &s;peak, and with as
much of the Engli&s;h accent as I could a&s;&s;ume,
&s;o as not to be under&s;tood, in ca&s;e our conver|&s;ation
&s;hould be too loud for the &s;pace.</P>
<P>We had each an elegant bed in the &s;ame
room; and here it was that a circum&s;tance oc|curred,
as to which he has been &s;trangely mi&s;un|der&s;tood.
From his de&s;cription of his chamber,
it has erroneou&s;ly been &s;uppo&s;ed, that, his bed
being too &s;hort for him, his feet, during the
night, were in the mire; whereas he has only
&s;aid, that, when he undre&s;&s;ed, he felt his feet in
the mire: that is, the clay-floor of the room,
on which he &s;tood before he went into bed, was
wet, in con&s;equence of the windows being
broken, which let in the rain.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>17th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Being informed that there was nothing wor|thy
of ob&s;ervation in Ulva, we took boat, and
proceeded to Inchkenneth, where we were in|troduced
by our friend Col to Sir Allan Mac|lean,
the Chief of his clan, and to two young
ladies, his daughters. Inchkenneth is a pretty
little i&s;land, a mile long, and about half a mile
broad, all good land.</P>
<P>As we walked up from the &s;hore, Dr. John|&s;on's
heart was cheered by the &s;ight of a road
marked with cart-wheels, as on the main land; a
<PB N="404" REF="410">
thing we had not &s;een for a long time. It
gave us a plea&s;ure &s;imilar to that which a tra|veller
feels, when, whil&s;t wandering on what he
fears is a de&s;art i&s;land, he perceives the print of
human feet.</P>
<P>Military men acquire excellent habits of
having all conveniencies about them. Sir
Allan M'Lean, who had been long in the
army, and had now a lea&s;e of this i&s;land, had
formed a commodious habitation, though it
con&s;i&s;ted but of a few &s;mall buildings, only
one &s;tory high. He had, in his little apart|ments,
more things than I could enumerate
in a page or two.</P>
<P>Among other agreeable circum&s;tances, it
was not the lea&s;t, to find here a parcel of the
<HI>Caledonian Mercury,</HI> publi&s;hed &s;ince we left
Edinburgh; which I read with that plea&s;ure
which every man feels who has been for &s;ome
time &s;ecluded from the animated &s;cenes of the
bu&s;y world.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on found books here. He bade me
buy Bi&s;hop Ga&s;trell's <HI>Chri&s;tian In&s;titutes,</HI> which
was lying in the room. He &s;aid, &startq;I do not
like to read any thing on a Sunday, but what
is theological; not that I would &s;crupulou&s;ly
refu&s;e to look at any thing which a friend
&s;hould &s;hew me in a news-paper; but in gene|ral,
I would read only what is theological.&mdash;I
read ju&s;t now &s;ome of Drummond's Travels,
<PB N="405" REF="411">
before I perceived what books were here. I
then took up Derham's Phy&s;ico-Theology.&endq;</P>
<P>Ever$ particular concerning this i&s;land hav|ing
been &s;o well de&s;cribed by Dr. John&s;on, it
would be &s;uperfluous in me to pre&s;ent the pub|lick
with the ob&s;ervations that I made upon it,
in my Journal.</P>
<P>I was quite ea&s;y with Sir Allan almo&s;t in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly.
He knew the great intimacy
that had been between my father and his pre|dece&s;&s;or,
Sir Hector, and was him&s;elf of a very
frank di&s;po&s;ition.&mdash;After dinner, Sir Allan &s;aid
he had got Dr. Campbell about an hundred
&s;ub&s;cribers to his <HI>Britannia Elucidata,</HI> (a work
&s;ince publi&s;hed under the title of <HI>A Political
Survey of Great-Britain,)</HI> of whom he believed
twenty were dead, the publication having been
&s;o long delayed.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, I imagine the
delay of publication is owing to this;&mdash;that,
after publication, there will be no more &s;ub|&s;cribers,
and few will &s;end the additional gui|nea
to get their books: in which they will be
wrong; for there will be a great deal of in|&s;truction
in the work. I think highly of
Campbell. In the fir&s;t place, he has very good
parts. In the second place, he has very exten|&s;ive
reading; not, perhaps, what is properly
called learning, but hi&s;tory, politicks, and, in
&s;hort, that popular knowledge which makes a
man very u&s;eful. In the third place, he has
<PB N="406" REF="412">
learnt much by what is called the <HI>vox viva.</HI> He
talks with a great many people.&endq;</P>
<P>Speaking of this gentleman, at Ra&s;ay, he
told us, that he one day called on him, and
they talked of Tull's <HI>Hu&s;bandry.</HI> Dr. Campbell
&s;aid &s;omething. Dr. John&s;on began to di&s;pute
it. &startq;Come, &s;aid Dr. Campbell, we do not
want to get the better of one another: we want
to increa&s;e each other's ideas.&endq;&mdash;Dr. John&s;on
took it in good part, and the conver&s;ation then
went on coolly and in&s;tructively.&mdash;His candour
in relating this anecdote does him much credit;
and his conduct on that occa&s;ion proves how
ea&s;ily he could be per&s;uaded to talk from a
better motive than &startq;for victory.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on here &s;hewed &s;o much of the
&s;pirit of a Highlander, that he won Sir Allan's
heart: indeed, he has &s;hewn it during the
whole of our Tour.&mdash;One night, in Col, he
&s;trutted about the room with a broad-&s;word and
target, and made a formidable appearance;
and, another night, I took the liberty to put a
large blue bonnet on his head. His age, his
&s;ize, and his bu&s;hy grey wig, with this covering
on it, pre&s;ented the image of a venerable
<HI>Senachi;</HI> and, however unfavourable to the
Lowland Scots, he &s;eemed much plea&s;ed to a&s;|&s;ume
the appearance of an ancient Caledonian.
We only regretted that he could not be pre|vailed
with to partake of the &s;ocial gla&s;s. One
<PB N="407" REF="413">
of his arguments again&s;t drinking, appears to
me not convincing. He urged, that &startq;in pro|portion
as drinking makes a man different from
what he is before he has drunk, it is bad; be|cau&s;e
it has &s;o far affected his rea&s;on.&endq;&mdash;But
may it not be an&s;wered, that a man may be al|tered
by it <HI>for the better;</HI> that his &s;pirits may
be exhilarated, without his rea&s;on being af|fected?
On the general &s;ubject of drinking,
however, I do not mean po&s;itively to take the
other &s;ide. I am <HI>dubius, non improbus.</HI></P>
<P>In the evening, Sir Allan informed us that it
was the cu&s;tom of his hou&s;e to have prayers
every Sunday; and Mi&s;s M'Lean read the
evening &s;ervice, in which we all joined. I
then read Ogden's &s;econd and ninth Sermons
on Prayer, which, with their other di&s;tingui&s;hed
excellence, have the merit of being &s;hort. Dr.
John&s;on &s;aid, that it was the mo&s;t agreeable
Sunday he had ever pa&s;&s;ed; and it made &s;uch
an impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, that he afterwards
wrote the following ode upon Inchkenneth:</P>

<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>18th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We agreed to pa&s;s this day with Sir Allan,
and he engaged to have every thing in order
for our voyage to-morrow.</P>
<P>Being now &s;oon to be &s;eparated from our
amiable friend young Col, his merits were
all remembered. At Ulva he had ap|peared
in a new character, having given us a
good pre&s;cription for a cold. On my men|tioning
him with warmth, Dr. John&s;on &s;aid,
&startq;Col does every thing for us: we will erect
a &s;tatue to Col.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Yes, &s;aid I, and we will
have him with his various attributes and cha|racters,
like Mercury, or any other of the
heathen gods. We will have him as a pilot;
we will have him as a fi&s;herman, as a hunter,
as a hu&s;bandman, as a phy&s;ician.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="415">
I this morning took a &s;pade, and dug a
little grave in the floor of a ruined chapel near
Sir Allan M'Lean's hou&s;e, in which I buried
&s;ome human bones I found there. Dr. John&s;on
prai&s;ed me for what I had done, though he
owned, he could not have done it. He &s;hewed
in the chapel at Ra&s;ay, his horrour at dead
mens' bones. He &s;hewed it again at Col's
hou&s;e. In the Charter-room there was a
remarkably large &s;hin-bone, which was &s;aid to
have been a bone of <HI>John Garve,</HI> one of the
lairds. Dr. John&s;on would not look at it; but
&s;tarted away.</P>
<P>At breakfa&s;t, I a&s;ked, &startq;What is the rea&s;on
that we are angry at a trader's having opu|lence?&endq;
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why, &s;ir, the rea&s;on is,
(though I don't undertake to prove that there
is a rea&s;on,) we &s;ee no qualities in trade that
&s;hould entitle a man to &s;uperiority. We are
not angry at a &s;oldier's getting riches, becau&s;e
we &s;ee that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es qualities which we have
not. If a man returns from a battle, having
lo&s;t one hand, and with the other full of gold,
we feel that he de&s;erves the gold; but we
cannot think that a fellow, by &s;itting all day
at a de&s;k, is entitled to get above us.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;|well.</HI>
&startq;But, &s;ir, may we not &s;uppo&s;e a mer|chant
to be a man of an enlarged mind, &s;uch
as Addi&s;on in the <HI>Spectator</HI> de&s;cribes Sir An|drew
Freeport to have been?&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why,
<PB N="410" REF="416">
&s;ir, we may &s;uppo&s;e any fictitious character.
We may &s;uppo&s;e a philo&s;ophi$al day-labourer,
who is happy in reflecting that, by his labour,
he contributes to the fertility of the earth, and
to the &s;upport of his fellow-creatures; but we
find no &s;uch philo&s;ophical day-labourer. A
merchant may, perhaps, be a man of an en|larged
mind; but there is nothing in trade
connected with an enlarged mind.&endq;</P>
<P>I mentioned that I had heard Dr. Solander
&s;ay he was a Swedi&s;h Laplander.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir,
I don't believe he is a Laplander. The Lap|landers
are not much above four feet high.
He is as tall you; and he has not the copper
colour of a Laplander.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;But what
motive could he have to make him&s;elf a Lap|lander?&endq;
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why, &s;ir, he mu&s;t
either mean the word Laplander in a very ex|ten&s;ive
&s;en&s;e, or may mean a voluntary degra|dation
of him&s;elf, &startq;For all my being the
great man that you &s;ee me now, I was origi|nally
a Barbarian;&endq; as if Burke &s;hould &s;ay, &startq;I
came over a wild Iri&s;hman,&endq;&mdash;which he might
&s;ay in his pre&s;ent &s;tate of exaltation.&endq;</P>
<P>Having expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to have an i&s;land
like Inchkenneth, Dr. John&s;on &s;et him&s;elf
to think what would be nece&s;&s;ary for a man in
&s;uch a &s;ituation. &startq;Sir, I &s;hould build me a
fortification, if I came to live here; for, if you
have it not, what &s;hould hinder a parcel of ruf|fians
<PB N="411" REF="417">
to land in the night, and carry off every
thing you have in the hou&s;e, which, in a remote
country, would be more valuable than cows
and &s;heep? add to all this the danger of hav|ing
your throat cut.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Bo&s;well.</HI> &startq;I would have
a large dog.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;So you may, &s;ir;
but a large dog is of no u&s;e but to alarm.&endq;&mdash;
He, however, I apprehend, thinks too lightly
of the power of that animal. I have heard him
&s;ay, that he is afraid of no dog. &startq;He would
take him up by the hinder legs, which would
render him quite helple&s;s,&mdash;and then knock his
head again&s;t a &s;tone, and beat out his brains.&endq;
&mdash;Topham Beauclerk told me, that at his hou&s;e
in the country, two large ferocious dogs were
fighting. Dr. John&s;on looked &s;teadily at them
for a little while; and then, as one would &s;e|parate
two little boys who are fooli&s;hly hurting
each other, he ran up to them, and cuffed their
heads till he drove them a&s;under. But few
men have his intrepidity, Herculean &s;trength,
or pre&s;ence of mind. Mo&s;t thieves or robbers
would be afraid to encounter a ma&s;tiff.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, that, when young Col talked of the
lands belonging to his family, he always &s;aid,
&startq;<HI>my</HI> lands.&endq; For this he had a plau&s;ible pretence;
for he told me, there has been a cu&s;tom in this
family, that the laird re&s;igns the e&s;tate to the
elde&s;t &s;on when he comes of age, re&s;erving to
him&s;elf only a certain life-rent. He &s;aid, it
<PB N="412" REF="418">
was a voluntary cu&s;tom; but I think I found
an in&s;tance in the charter-room that there was
&s;uch an obligation in a contract of marriage.
If the cu&s;tom was voluntary, it was only cu|rious;
but if founded on obligation, it might
be dangerous: for I have been told, that in
Otaheit&eacute;, whenever a child is born, (a &s;on, I
think,) the father lo&s;es his right to the e&s;tate
and honours, and that this unnatural, or rather
ab&s;urd cu&s;tom, occa&s;ions the murder of many
children.</P>
<P>Young Col told us he could run down a
greyhound; &startq;for, &s;aid he, the dog runs him|&s;elf
out of breath, by going too quick, and then
I get up with him.&endq; I accounted for his advan|tage
over the dog, by remarking that Col had
the faculty of rea&s;on, and knew how to mode|rate
his pace, which the dog had not &s;en&s;e
enough to do. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;He is a
noble animal. He is as complete an i&s;lander as
the mind can figure. He is a farmer, a &s;ailor,
a hunter, a fi&s;her: he will run you down a dog:
if any man has a <HI>tail,</HI> it is Col. He is ho&s;pi|table;
and he has an intrepidity of talk, whe|ther
he under&s;tands the &s;ubject or not. I regret
that he is not more intellectual.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved, that there was nothing
of which he would not undertake to per&s;uade a
Frenchman in a foreign country. &startq;I'll carry
a Frenchman to St. Paul's Church-yard, and
<PB N="413" REF="419">
I'll tell him, &startq;by our law, you may walk half
round the church; but, if you walk round the
whole, you will be puni&s;hed capitally:&endq; and he
will believe me at once. Now, no Engli&s;hman
would readily &s;wallow &s;uch a thing: he would
go and inquire of &s;omebody el&s;e.&endq;&mdash;The
Frenchman's credulity, I ob&s;erved, mu&s;t be
owing to his being accu&s;tomed to implicit &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion;
whereas every Engli&s;hman rea&s;ons
upon the laws of his country, and in&s;tructs his
repre&s;entatives who compo&s;e the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>This day was pa&s;&s;ed in looking at a &s;mall
i&s;land adjoining Inchkenneth, which afforded
nothing worthy of ob&s;ervation; and in &s;uch
&s;ocial and gay entertainments as our little &s;o|ciety
could furni&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>Tue&s;day, <DATE>19th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>After breakfa&s;t we took leave of the young
ladies, and of our excellent companion Col, to
whom we had been &s;o much obliged. He had
now put us under the care of his Chief; and
was to ha&s;ten back to Sky. We parted from
him with very &s;trong feelings of kindne&s;s and
gratitude; and we hoped to have had &s;ome fu|ture
opportunity of proving to him the &s;incerity
of what we felt; but in the following year he
was unfortunately lo&s;t in the Sound between
Ulva and Mull; and this imperfect memorial,
joined to the high honour of being tenderly
<PB N="414" REF="420">
$nd re&s;pectfully mentioned by Dr. John&s;on, $word$
the only return which the uncertainty of huma$
events has permitted us to make to this de&s;erv|ving
young man.</P>
<P>Sir Allan, who obligingly undertook to
accompany us to Icolmkill, had a &s;trong good
boat, with four &s;tout rowers. We coa&s;ted
along Mull till we reached <HI>Gribon,</HI> where is
what is called Mackinnon's cave, compared
with which that at Ulini&s;h is incon&s;iderable.
It is in a rock of a great height clo&s;e to the &s;ea.
Upon the left of its entrance there is a ca&s;cade,
almo&s;t perpendicular from top to bottom of
the rock. There is a tradition that it was
conducted thither artificially, to &s;upply the in|habitants
of the cave with water. Dr. John|&s;on
gave no credit to this tradition. As, on
the one hand, his faith in the Chri&s;tian religion
is firmly founded upon good grounds; &s;o, on
the other, he is incredulous when there is no
&s;ufficient rea&s;on for belief; being in this re|&s;pect
ju&s;t the rever&s;e of modern infidels, who,
however nice and &s;crupulous in weighing the
evidences of religion, are yet often &s;o ready to
believe the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and improbable tales of
another nature, that Lord Hailes well ob|&s;erved,
a good e&s;&s;ay might be written <HI>Sur la
credulit&eacute; des Incredules.</HI></P>
<P>The height of this cave I cannot tell with
any tolerable exactne&s;s; but it &s;eemed to be
<PB N="415" REF="421">
very lofty, and to be a pretty regular arch.
We penetrated, by candlelight, a great way;
by our mea&s;urement, no le&s;s than four hundred
and eighty-five feet. Tradition &s;ays, that a
piper and twelve men once advanced into this
cave, nobody can tell how far; and never re|turned.
At the di&s;tance to which we pro|ceeded
the air was quite pure; for the candle
burnt freely, without the lea&s;t appearance of
the flame growing globular; but as we had
only one, we thought it dangerous to venture
further, le&s;t, &s;hould it have been extingui&s;hed,
we &s;hould have had no means of a&s;certaining
whether we could remain without danger. Dr.
John&s;on &s;aid, this was the greate&s;t natural cu|rio&s;ity
he had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>We &s;aw the i&s;land of Sta$$a, at no very great
di&s;tance, but could not land upon it, the &s;urge
was &s;o high on its rocky coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir Allan, anxious for the honour of Mull,
was &s;till talking of its <HI>woods,</HI> and pointing them
out to Dr. John&s;on, as appearing at a di&s;tance
on the &s;kirts of that i&s;land, as we &s;ailed along.
&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, I &s;aw at Tobermorie what
they called a wood, which I unluckily took for
<HI>$eath.</HI> If you &s;hew me what I &s;hall take for
<HI>furze,</HI> it will be &s;omething.&endq;</P>
<P>In the afternoon we went a&s;hore on the coa&s;t
of Mull, and partook of a cold repa&s;t, which
$e carried with us. We hoped to have pro|cured
<PB N="416" REF="422">
&s;ome rum or brandy for our boatmen
and &s;ervants, from a publick-hou&s;e near where
we landed; but unfortunately a funeral a few
days before had exhau&s;ted all their &s;tore. Mr.
Campbell however, one of the Duke of Argyle's
tack&s;men, who lived in the neighbourhood, on
receiving a me&s;&s;age from Sir Allan, &s;ent us a
liberal &s;upply.</P>
<P>We continued to coa&s;t along Mull, and
pa&s;&s;ed by Nuns' I&s;land, which it is &s;aid be|longed
to the nuns of Icolmkill, and from
which, we were told, the &s;tone for the buildings
there was taken. As we &s;ailed along by moon|light,
in a &s;ea &s;omewhat rough, and often be|tween
black and gloomy rocks, Dr. John&s;on
&s;aid, &startq;If this be not <HI>roving among the
Hebrides,</HI> nothing is.&endq;&mdash;The repetition of
words which he had &s;o often previou&s;ly u&s;ed,
made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on my imagination;
and, by a natural cour&s;e of thinking, led me
to con&s;ider how our pre&s;ent adventures would
appear to me at a future period.</P>
<P>I have often experienced, that &s;cenes through
which a man has pa&s;&s;ed, improve by lying in
the memory: they grow mellow. <HI>Acti labores
&s;unt jucundi.</HI> This may be owing to comparing
them with pre&s;ent li&s;tle&s;s ea&s;e. Even har&s;h
&s;cenes acquire a &s;oftne&s;s by length of time;
and &s;ome are like very loud &s;ounds, which do
not plea&s;e, or at lea&s;t do not plea&s;e &s;o much,
<PB N="417" REF="423">
till you are removed to a certain di&s;tance.
They may be compared to &s;trong coar&s;e pic|tures,
which will not bear to be viewed near.
Even plea&s;ing &s;cenes improve by time, and
&s;eem more exqui&s;ite in recollection, than when
they were pre&s;ent; if they have not faded to
dimne&s;s in the memory. Perhaps, there is &s;o
much evil in every human enjoyment, when
pre&s;ent,&mdash;&s;o much dro&s;s mixed with it, that it
requires to be refined by time; and yet I do
not &s;ee why time &s;hould not melt away the
good and the evil in equal proportions;&mdash;why
the &s;hade &s;hould decay, and the light remain in
pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>After a tedious &s;ail, which, by our following
various turnings of the coa&s;t of Mull, was ex|tended
to about forty miles, it gave us no
&s;mall plea&s;ure to perceive a light in the village
at Icolmkill, in which almo&s;t all the inhabitants
of the i&s;land live, clo&s;e to where the ancient
buildings &s;tood. As we approached the &s;hore,
the tower of the cathedral, ju&s;t di&s;cernible in
the air, was a picture&s;que object.</P>
<P>When we had landed upon this &s;acred place,
which, as long as I can remember, I had
thought on with veneration, Dr. John&s;on and
Icordially embraced. We had long talked of
vi&s;iting I colmkill; and, from the latene&s;s of the
&s;ea&s;on, were at times very doubtful whether we
&s;hould be able to effect our purpo&s;e. To have
&s;een it, even alone, would have given me great
<PB N="418" REF="424">
&s;atisfaction; but the venerable &s;cene was ren|dered
much more plea&s;ing by the company of
my great and pious friend, who was no le&s;s
affected by it than I was; and who has de|&s;cribed
the impre&s;&s;ions it &s;hould make on the
mind, with &s;uch &s;trength of thought, and ener|gy
of language, that I &s;hall quote his words,
as conveying my own &s;en&s;ations much more
forcibly than I am capable of doing:</P>
<P>&startq;WE were now treading that illu&s;trious
I&s;land, which was once the luminary of the
Caledonian regions, whence &s;avage clans and
roving barbarians derived the benefits of know|ledge,
and the ble&s;&s;ings of religion. To ab|&s;tract
the mind from all local emotion would
be impo&s;&s;ible, if it were endeavoured, and would
be fooli&s;h, if it were po&s;&s;ible. Whatever with|draws
us from the power of our &s;en&s;es, what|ever
makes the pa&s;t, the di&s;tant, or the future,
predominate over the pre&s;ent, advances us in
the dignity of thinking beings. Far from me,
and from my friends, be &s;uch frigid philo&s;ophy
as may conduct us indifferent and unmoved
over any ground which has been dignified by
wi&s;dom, bravery, or virtue. That man is little
to be envied, who&s;e patrioti&s;m would not gain
force upon the plain of <HI>Marathon,</HI> or who&s;e
piety would not grow warmer among the ruins
of <HI>Iona!</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Had our Tour produced nothing el&s;e but this &s;ublime pa&s;&s;age, the world mu&s;t have acknowledged that it was not made in vain. The pre&s;ent re&s;pectable Pre&s;ident of the Royal Society was &s;o much &s;truck on reading it, that he cla&s;ped his hands together, and remained for &s;ome time in a attitude of &s;ilent admiration.</NOTE>&endq;</P>

Upon hearing that Sir Allan M'Lean was ar|rived,
the inhabitants, who &s;till con&s;ider them|&s;elves
as the people of M'Lean, to whom the
i&s;land formerly belonged, though the Duke of
Argyle has at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, ran ea|gerly
to him.</P>
<P>We were accommodated this night in a large
barn, the i&s;land affording no lodging that we
&s;hould have liked &s;o well. Some good hay was
&s;trewed at one end of it, to form a bed for us,
upon which we lay with our clothes on; and we
were furni&s;hed with blankets from the village.
Each of us had a portmanteau for a pillow.
When I awaked in the morning, and looked
round me, I could not help &s;miling at the idea
of the Chief of the M'Leans, the great Engli&s;h
Morali&s;t, and my&s;elf, lying thus extended in
&s;uch a &s;ituation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Wedne&s;day, <DATE>20th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Early in the morning we &s;urveyed the re|mains
of antiquity at this place, accompanied
by an illiterate fellow, as <HI>Cicerone,</HI> who called
him&s;elf a de&s;cendant of a cou&s;in of Saint Co|lumba,
the founder of the religious e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
here. As I knew that many per&s;ons had
<PB N="420" REF="426">
already examined them, and as I &s;aw Dr.
John&s;on in&s;pecting and mea&s;uring &s;everal of
the ruins of which he has &s;ince given &s;o full an
account, my mind was quie&s;cent; and I re|&s;olved
to &s;troll among them at my ea&s;e, to take
no trouble to inve&s;tigate minutely, and only
receive the general impre&s;&s;ion of &s;olemn anti|quity,
and the particular ideas of &s;uch objects
as &s;hould of them&s;elves &s;trike my attention.</P>
<P>We walked from the Mona&s;tery of Nuns to
the great church or cathedral, as they call it,
along an old broken cau&s;eway. They told us,
that this had been a &s;treet; and that there were
good hou&s;es built on each &s;ide. Dr. John&s;on
doubted if it was any thing more than a paved
road for the nuns. The Convent of Monks,
the great church, Oran's chapel, and four other
chapels, are &s;till to be di&s;cerned. But I mu&s;t
own that Icolmkill did not an&s;wer my expec|tations;
for they were high, from what I had
read of it, and &s;till more from what I had heard
and thought of it, from my earlie&s;t years. Dr.
John&s;on &s;aid, it came up to his expectations,
becau&s;e he had taken his impre&s;&s;ion from an
account of it &s;ubjoined to Sacheverel's Hi&s;tory
of the I&s;le of Man, where it is &s;aid, there is
not much to be &s;een here. We were both di&s;|appointed,
when we were &s;hewn what are
called the monuments of the Kings of Scotland,
Ireland, and Denmark, and of a King of
<PB N="421" REF="427">
France. There are only &s;ome grave-&s;tones
flat on the earth, and we could &s;ee no in&s;crip|tions.
How far &s;hort was this of marble mo|numents,
like tho&s;e in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,
which I had imaged here! The grave-&s;tones
of Sir Allan M'Lean's family, and of
that of M'Quarrie, had as good an appearance
as the royal ones; if they were royal, which
we doubted.</P>
<P>My ea&s;ine&s;s to give credit to what I heard
in the cour&s;e of our Tour, was too great. Dr.
John&s;on's peculiar accuracy of inve&s;tigation
detected much traditional fiction, and many
gro&s;s mi&s;takes. It is not to be wondered at,
that he was provoked by people carele&s;sly telling
him, with the utmo&s;t readine&s;s and confidence,
what he found, on que&s;tioning them a little
more, was erroneous. Of this there were in|numerable
in&s;tances.</P>
<P>I left him and Sir Allan at breakfa&s;t in
our barn, and &s;tole back again to the cathe|dral,
to indulge in &s;olitude and devout medi|tation.
While contemplating the venerable
ruins, I reflected with much &s;atisfaction, that
the &s;olemn &s;cenes of piety never lo&s;e their &s;anc|tity
and influence, though the cares and follies
of life may prevent us from vi&s;iting them, or
may even make us fancy that their effects are
only &startq;as ye&s;terday, when it is pa&s;t,&endq; and never
again to be perceived. I hoped, that, ever after
having been in this holy place, I &s;hould main|tain
<PB N="422" REF="428">
an exemplary conduct. One has a &s;trange
propen&s;ity to fix upon &s;ome point of time from
whence a better cour&s;e of life may begin.</P>
<P>Being de&s;irous to vi&s;it the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of
the i&s;land, where Saint Columba is &s;aid to have
landed, I procured a hor&s;e from one M'Ginnis,
who ran along as my guide. The M'Ginni&s;es
are &s;aid to be a branch of the clan of M'Lean.
Sir Allan had been told that this man had re|fu&s;ed
to &s;end him &s;ome rum, at which the
knight was in great indignation. &startq;You ra&s;cal!
(&s;aid he,) don't you know that I can hang you,
if I plea&s;e?&endq;&mdash;Not adverting to the Chieftain's
power over his clan, I imagined that Sir
Allan had known of &s;ome capital crime that
the fellow had committed, which he could di&s;|cover,
and &s;o get him condemned; and &s;aid,
&startq;How &s;o?&endq;&mdash;&startq;Why, (&s;aid Sir Allan,) are
they not all my people?&endq;&mdash;Sen&s;ible of my in|advertency,
and mo&s;t willing to contribute what
I could towards the continuation of feudal au|thority,
&startq;Very true,&endq; &s;aid I.&mdash;Sir Allan went
on: &startq;Refu&s;e to &s;end rum to me, you ra&s;cal!
Don't you know that, if I order you to go and
cut a man's throat, you are to do it?&endq;&mdash;&startq;Yes,
an$t plea&s;e your honour! and my own too, and
hang my&s;elf too.&endq;&mdash;The poor fellow denied
that he had refu&s;ed to &s;end the rum. His
making the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions was not merely a pre|tence
in pre&s;ence of his Chief; for after he and
<PB N="423" REF="429">
I were out of Sir Allan's hearing, he told me,
&startq;Had he &s;ent his dog for the rum, I would
have given it: I would cut my bones for him.&endq;
&mdash;It was very remarkable to find &s;uch an at|tachment
to a Chief, though he had then no
connection with the i&s;land, and had not been
there for fourteen years.&mdash;Sir Allan, by way of
upbraiding the fellow, &s;aid, &startq;I believe you
are a <HI>Campbell.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>The place which I went to &s;ee is about two
miles from the village. They call it <HI>Porta|wherry,</HI>
from the wherry in which Columba
came; though, when they &s;hew the length of
his ve&s;&s;el, as marked on the beach by two heaps
of &s;tones, they &s;ay, &startq;Here is the length of the
<HI>Currach,</HI>&endq; u&s;ing the Er&s;e word.</P>
<P>Icolmkill is a fertile i&s;land. The inhabitants
export &s;ome cattle and grain; and, I was told,
they import nothing but iron and $alt. They
are indu&s;trious, and make their own woollen
and linen cloth; and they brew a good deal of
beer, which we did not find in any of the other
i&s;lands.</P>
<P>We &s;et &s;ail again about mid-day, and in the
evening landed on Mull, near the hou&s;e of the
Reverend Mr. Neil M'Leod, who, having been
informed of our coming, by a me&s;&s;age from
Sir Allan, came out to meet us. We were this
night very agreeably entertained at his hou&s;e.
Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved to me, that he was the
<PB N="424" REF="430">
cleane&s;t-headed man that he had met with in
the We&s;tern I&s;lands. He &s;eemed to be well
acquainted with Dr. John&s;on's writings, and
courteou&s;ly &s;aid, &startq;I have been often obliged
to you, though I never had the plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing
you before.&endq;</P>
<P>He told us, he had lived for &s;ome time in
St. Kilda, under the tuition of the mini&s;ter or
catechi&s;t there; and had there fir&s;t read Horace
and Virgil. The &s;cenes which they de&s;cribe

&mdash;Mr. M'Leod was much plea&s;ed
with the ju&s;tice and novelty of the thought.&mdash;
Dr. John&s;on illu&s;trated what he had &s;aid, as fol|lows:
&startq;Take, as an in&s;tance, Charles the
Fir&s;t's conce&s;&s;ions to his parliament, which were
greater and greater, in proportion as the par|liament

nakedly, without any detail of the circum|&s;tances
which gradually led to them, they
would not have been believed.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Allan M'Lean bragged, that Scotland had
the advantage of England, by its having more
water. <HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, we would not have your
water, to take the vile bogs which produce it.
You have too much! A man who is drowned
has more water than either of us;&endq;&mdash;and then he
laughed.&mdash;(But this was &s;urely robu&s;t &s;ophi&s;try;
for the people of ta&s;te in England, who have
&s;een Scotland, own that its variety of rivers and
lakes makes it naturally more beautiful than
England, in that re&s;pect.)&mdash;Pur&s;uing his vic|tory
over Sir Allan, he proceeded: &startq;Your
country con&s;i&s;ts of two things, &s;tone and water.
There is, indeed, a little earth above the &s;tone
in &s;ome places, but a very little; and the &s;tone
is always appearing. It is like a man in rags;
the naked &s;kin is &s;till peeping out.&endq;</P>
<P>He took leave of Mr. M'Leod, &s;aying, &startq;Sir,
I thank you for your entertainment, and your
conver&s;ation.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Campbell, who had been &s;o polite ye&s;|terday,
came this morning on purpo&s;e to break|fa&s;t
with us, and very obligingly furni&s;hed us
with hor&s;es to proceed on our journey to Mr.
M'Clean's of <HI>Lochbuy,</HI> where we were to
pa&s;s the night. We dined at the hou&s;e of Dr.
<PB N="427" REF="433">
Alexander M'Lean, another phy&s;ician in Mull,
who was &s;o much &s;truck with the uncommon
conver&s;ation of Dr. John&s;on, that he ob&s;erved
to me, &startq;This man is ju&s;t a <HI>hog&s;head</HI> of &s;en&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on &s;aid of the <HI>Turki&s;h Spy,</HI> which
lay in the room, that it told nothing but what
every body might have known at that time;
and that what was good in it, did not pay you
for the trouble of reading to find it.</P>
<P>After a very tedious ride, through what
appeared to me the mo&s;t gloomy and de&s;o|late
country I had ever beheld, we arrived,
between &s;even and eight o'clock, at <HI>Moy,</HI>
the &s;eat of the Laird of <HI>Lochbuy.&mdash;Buy,</HI> in
Er&s;e, &s;ignifies yellow, and I at fir&s;t imagined
that the loch or branch of the &s;ea here, was
thus denominated, in the &s;ame manner as the
<HI>Red Sea;</HI> but I afterwards learnt it derived its
name from a hill above it, which, being of a
yellowi&s;h hue, has the epithet of <HI>Buy.</HI></P>
<P>We had heard much of Lochbuy's being
a great roaring braggadocio, a kind of
Sir John Fal&s;taff, both in &s;ize and m$nners;
but we found that they had &s;welled him up to
a fictitious &s;ize, and clothed him with imagi|nary
qualities.&mdash;Col's idea of him was equally
extravagant, though very different: he told us,
he was quite a Don Quixote; and &s;aid, he
would give a great deal to &s;ee him and Dr.
John&s;on together. The truth is, that Loch|buy
<PB N="428" REF="434">
proved to be only a bluff, comely, noi&s;y
old gentleman, proud of his hereditary con&s;e|quence,
and a very hearty and ho&s;pitable land|lord.
Lady Lochbuy was &s;i&s;ter to Sir Allan
M'Lean, but much older. He &s;aid to me,
&startq;They are quite <HI>Antediluvians.</HI>&endq; Being told that
Dr. John&s;on did not hear well, Lochbuy bawled
out to him, &startq;Are you of the John&s;tons of
Glencro, or of Ardnamurchan?&endq;&mdash;Dr. John&s;on
gave him a &s;ignificant look, but made no an|&s;wer;
and I told Lochbuy that he was not
John&s;ton, but John&s;on, and that he was an Eng|li&s;hman.</P>
<P>Lochbuy &s;ome years ago tried to prove him|&s;elf
a weak man, liable to impo&s;ition, or, as
we term it in Scotland, a <HI>facile</HI> man, in order
to &s;et a&s;ide a lea&s;e which he had granted; but
failed in the attempt. On my mentioning
this circum&s;tance to Dr. John&s;on, he &s;eemed
much &s;urprized that &s;uch a &s;uit was admitted
by the Scotti&s;h law, and ob&s;erved, that &startq;in
England no man is allowed to <HI>&s;tultify</HI> him&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Allan, Lochbuy, and I, had the conver|&s;ation
chiefly to our&s;elves to-night: Dr. John|&s;on,
being extremely weary, went to bed &s;oon
after &s;upper.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>22d October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Before Dr. John&s;on came to breakfa&s;t, Lady
Lochbuy &s;aid, &startq;he was a <HI>dungeon</HI> of wit;&endq;
<PB N="429" REF="435">
a very common phra&s;e in Scotland to expre&s;s a
profoundne&s;s of intellect, though he afterwards
told me, that he had never heard it. She pro|po&s;ed
that he &s;hould have &s;ome cold &s;heep's-head
for breakfa&s;t. Sir Allan &s;eemed di&s;|plea&s;ed
at his &s;i&s;ters vulgarity, and wondered
how &s;uch a thought &s;hould come into her head.
From a mi&s;chievous love of &s;port, I took the
lady's part; and very gravely &s;aid, &startq;I think
it is but fair to give him an offer of it. If he
does not choo&s;e it, he may let it alone.&endq;&mdash;&startq;I
think &s;o,&endq; &s;aid the lady, looking at her brother
with an air of victory. Sir Allan, finding the
matter de&s;perate, &s;trutted about the room, and
took &s;nuff. When Dr. John&s;on came in, &s;he
called to him, &startq;Do you choo&s;e any cold
&s;heep's-head, &s;ir?&endq;&mdash;&startq;No, MADAM,&endq; &s;aid he,
with a tone of &s;urpri&s;e and anger.&mdash;&startq;It is here,
&s;ir,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &s;uppo&s;ing he had refu&s;ed it to
&s;ave the trouble of bringing it in. They thus
went on at cro&s;s purpo&s;es, till he confirmed his
refu&s;al in a manner not to be mi&s;under&s;tood;
while I &s;at quietly by, and enjoyed my &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, we &s;urveyed the old ca&s;tle,
in the pit or dungeon of which Lochbuy had
&s;ome years before taken upon him to impri&s;on
&s;everal per&s;ons; and though he had been fined
in a con&s;iderable &s;um by the Court of Ju&s;ti|ciary,
he was &s;o little affected by it, that,
while we were examining the dungeon, he &s;aid
<PB N="430" REF="436">
to me, with a &s;mile, &startq;Your father knows
&s;omething of this;&endq; (alluding to my father's
having &s;at as one of the judges on his trial.)
Sir Allan whi&s;pered me, that the laird could
not be per&s;uaded, that he had lo&s;t his heri|table
juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>We then &s;et out for the ferry, by which we
were to cro&s;s to the main land of Argyle&s;hire.
Lochbuy and Sir Allan accompanied us. We
were told much of a war-&s;addle, on which this
reputed Don Quixote u&s;ed to be mounted; but
we did not &s;ee it, for the young laird had ap|plied
it to a le&s;s noble purpo&s;e, having taken it
to Falkirk fair <HI>with a drove of black cattle.</HI></P>
<P>We bade adieu to Lochbuy, and to our very
kind conductor Sir Allan M'Lean, on the &s;hore
of Mull, and then got into the ferry-boat, the
bottom of which was &s;trewed with branches of
trees or bu&s;hes, upon which we &s;at. We had a
good day, and a fine pa&s;&s;age, and in the evening
landed at Oban, where we found a tolerable
inn. After having been &s;o long confined at
different times in i&s;lands, from which it was
always uncertain when we could get away, it
was comfortable to be now on the main land,
and to know that, if in health, we might
get to any place in Scotland or England in a
certain number of days.</P>
<P>Here we di&s;covered, from the conjectures
which were formed, that the people on the
<PB N="431" REF="437">
main land were entirely ignorant of our mo|tions;
for in a Gla&s;gow news-paper we found
a paragraph, which, as it contains a ju&s;t and
well-turned compliment to my illu&s;trious
friend, I &s;hall here in&s;ert:</P>
<P>&startq;We are well a&s;&s;ured that Doctor John&s;on
is confined by tempe&s;tuous weather to the
i&s;le of Sky; it being un&s;afe to venture, in a
&s;mall boat, upon &s;uch a &s;tormy &s;urge as is
very common there at this time of the year.
Such a philo&s;opher, detained on an almo&s;t
barren i&s;land, re&s;embles a whale left upon the
&s;trand. The latter will be welcome to every
body, on account of his oil, his bone, &amp;c.
and the other will charm his companions,
and the rude inhabitants, with his &s;uperior
knowledge and wi&s;dom, calm re&s;ignation,
and unbounded benevolence.&endq;</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>23d October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>After a good night's re&s;t, we breakfa&s;ted at
our lei&s;ure. We talked of Gold&s;mith's <HI>Traveller,</HI>
of which Dr. John&s;on &s;poke highly; and, while
I was helping him on with his great coat, he
repeated from it the character of the Engli&s;h
nation, which he did with &s;uch energy, that
the tear &s;tarted into his eye.</P>
<P>We could get but one bridle here, which,
according to the maxim <HI>detur digniori,</HI> was ap|propriated
to Dr. John&s;on's &s;heltie. I and
<PB N="432" REF="438">
Jo&s;eph rode with halters. We cro&s;&s;ed in a
ferry-boat a pretty wide lake, and on the fur|ther
&s;ide of it, clo&s;e by the &s;hore, found a hut
for our inn. We were much wet. I changed
my clothes in part, and was at pains to get
my&s;elf well dried. Dr. John&s;on re&s;olutely kept
on all his clothes, wet as they were, letting
them &s;team before the &s;moky turf fire. I
thought him in the wrong; but his firmne&s;s
was, perhaps, a &s;pecies of heroi&s;m.</P>
<P>I remember but little of our conver&s;ation.
I mentioned Shen&s;tone's &s;aying of Pope, that
he had the art of conden&s;ing &s;en&s;e more than
any body. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid, &startq;It is not true,
&s;ir. There is more &s;en&s;e in a line of Cowley
than in a page (or a &s;entence, or ten lines,&mdash;I
am not quite certain of the very phra&s;e) of
Pope.&endq; He maintained, that Archibald, Duke
of Argyle, was a narrow man. I wondered at
this; and ob&s;erved, that his building &s;o great
a hou&s;e at Inveraray was not like a narrow
man. &startq;Sir, (&s;aid he,) when a narrow man
has re&s;olved to build a hou&s;e, he builds it like
another man. But Archibald, Duke of Ar|gyle,
was narrow in his ordinary expences, in
his quotidian expences.&endq;</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction is very ju&s;t. It is in the
ordinary expences of life that a man's liberality
or narrowne&s;s is to be di&s;covered.&mdash;I never
heard the word <HI>quotidian</HI> in this &s;en&s;e, and I
<PB N="433" REF="439">
imagined it to be a word of Dr. John&s;on's own
fabrication; but I have &s;ince found it in Dr.
Young's <HI>Night Thoughts,</HI> (Night fifth,)
<Q><L>&startq;Death's a de&s;troyer of quotidian prey.&endq;</L></Q>
and in my friend's Dictionary, &s;upported by
the authorities of Charles I. and Dr. Donne.</P>
<P>It rained very hard as we journeyed on after
dinner. The roar of torrents from the moun|tains,
as we pa&s;&s;ed along in the du&s;k, and the
other circum&s;tances attending our ride this
evening, have been mentioned with &s;o much
animation by Dr. John&s;on, that I &s;hall not at|tempt
to &s;ay any thing on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>We got at night to Inveraray, where we
found an excellent inn. Even here, Dr. John&s;on
would not change his wet clothes.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect of good accommodation
cheered us much. We &s;upped well; and after
&s;upper, Dr. John&s;on, whom I had not &s;een ta&s;te
any fermented liquor during all our travels,
called for a gill of whi&s;ky. &startq;Come, (&s;aid he,)
let me know what it is that makes a Scot&s;man
happy!&endq; He drank it all but a drop, which I
begged leave to pour into my gla&s;s, that I
might &s;ay we had drank whi&s;ky together. I
propo&s;ed Mrs. Thrale &s;hould be our toa&s;t. He
would not have <HI>her</HI> drunk in whi&s;ky, but rather
&startq;&s;ome in&s;ular lady;&endq; &s;o we drank one of
the ladies whom we had lately left.&mdash;He owned
<PB N="434" REF="440">
to-night, that he got as good a room and bed
as at an Engli&s;h inn.</P>
<P>I had here the plea&s;ure of finding a letter
from home, which relieved me from the anxiety
I had &s;uffered, in con&s;equence of not having
received any account of my family for many
weeks. I al&s;o found a letter from Mr. Gar|rick,
which was a regale as agreeable as a pine|apple
would be in a de&s;ert. He had favoured
me with his corre&s;pondence for many years;
and when Dr. John&s;on and I were at Inverne&s;s,
I had written to him as follows:</P>

<P>&startq;HERE I am,&endq; and Mr. Samuel John&s;on
actually with me. We were a night at Fores,
in coming to which, in the du&s;k of the evening,
we pa&s;&s;ed over the bleak and bla&s;ted heath
where Macbeth met the witches. Your old
preceptor repeated, with much &s;olemnity, the

<Q><L>&startq;How far is't call'd to Fores? What are the&s;e,</L>
<L>So wither'd, and &s;o wild in their attire,&endq; &amp;c.</L></Q>
This day we vi&s;ited the ruins of Macbeth's
ca&s;tle at Inverne&s;s. I have had great roman|tick
&s;atisfaction in &s;eeing John&s;on upon the
cla&s;&s;ical &s;cenes of Shak&s;peare in Scotland; which
I really looked upon as almo&s;t as improbable as
that &startq;Birnam wood &s;hould come to Dun&s;inane.&endq;
Indeed, as I have always been accu&s;tomed to
<PB N="435" REF="441">
view him as a permanent London object, it
would not be much more wonderful to me to
&s;ee St. Paul's church moving along where we
now are. As yet we have travelled in po&s;t|chai&s;es;
but to-morrow we are to mount on
hor&s;eback, and a&s;cend into the mountains by
Fort Augu&s;tus, and &s;o on to the ferry, where
we are to cro&s;s to Sky. We &s;hall &s;ee that
I&s;land fully, and then vi&s;it &s;ome more of the
Hebrides; after which we are to land in Ar|gyle&s;hire,
proceed by Gla&s;gow to Auchinleck,
repo&s;e there a competent time, and then re|turn

will depart for old England again, as &s;oon as

<HEAD>Sunday, <DATE>24th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the forenoon calmly and placidly.
I prevailed on Dr. John&s;on to read aloud
Ogden's &s;ixth Sermon on Prayer, which he did
with a di&s;tinct expre&s;&s;ion, and plea&s;ing &s;olem|nity.
He prai&s;ed my favourite preacher, his
elegant language and remarkable acutene&s;s;
and &s;aid, he fought infidels with their own
weapons.</P>
<P>As a &s;pecimen of Ogden's manner, I in&s;ert the
following pa&s;&s;age from the &s;ermon which Dr.
John&s;on now read. The preacher, after arguing
again&s;t that vain philo&s;ophy which main|tains,
in conformity with the hard principle of
eternal nece&s;&s;ity, or unchangeable predetermi|nation,
that the only effect of prayer for others,
<PB N="439" REF="445">
although we are exhorted to pray for them, is to
produce good di&s;po&s;itions in our&s;elves towards
them; thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf:</P>
<P>&startq;A plain man might be apt to a&s;k, But if
this then, though enjoined in the holy &s;crip|tures,
is to be my real aim and intention,
when I am taught to pray for other per&s;ons,
why is it that I do not plainly &s;o expre&s;s it?
Why is not the form of the petition brought
nearer to the meaning? Give them, &s;ay I to
our heavenly father, what is good. But
this, I am to under&s;tand, will be as it will
be, and is not for me to alter. What is it
then that I am doing? I am de&s;iring to be|come
charitable my&s;elf; and why may I not
plainly &s;ay &s;o? Is there &s;hame in it, or im|piety?
The wi&s;h is laudable: why &s;hould I
form de&s;igns to hide it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Or is it, perhaps, better to be brought
about by indirect means, and in this artful
manner? Alas! who is it that I would im|po&s;e
on? From whom can it be, in this
commerce, that I de&s;ire to hide any thing?
When, as my &s;aviour commands me, I have
<HI>entered into my clo&s;et, and &s;hut my door,</HI> there
are but two parties privy to my devotions,
GOD and my own heart; which of the two
am I deceiving?&endq;</P>
<P>He wi&s;hed to have more books, and, upon in|quiring
if there were any in the hou&s;e, was told
<PB N="440" REF="446">
that a waiter had &s;ome, which were brought
to him; but I recollect none of them,
except Hervey's <HI>Meditations.</HI> He thought
frightingly of this admired book. He treated
it with ridicule, and would not allow even the
&s;cene of the dying Hu&s;band and Father to
be pathetick. I am not an impartial judge;
for Hervey's <HI>Meditations</HI> engaged my affec|tions
in my early years.&mdash;He read a pa&s;&s;age
concerning the moon, ludicrou&s;ly, and &s;hewed
how ea&s;ily he could, in the &s;ame &s;tyle, make
reflections on that planet, the very rever&s;e of
Hervey's, repre&s;enting her as treacherous to
mankind. He did this with much humour;
but I have not pre&s;erved the particulars. He
then indulged a playful fancy, in making a
<HI>Meditation on a pudding,</HI> of which I ha&s;tily
wrote down, in his pre&s;ence, the following
note; which, though imperfect, may &s;erve to
give my readers &s;ome idea of it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MEDITATION ON A PUDDING.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;LET us &s;eriou&s;ly reflect of what a pudding
is compo&s;ed. It is compo&s;ed of flour that once
waved in the golden grain, and drank the dews
of the morning; of milk pre&s;&s;ed from the
&s;welling udder by the gentle hand of the beau|teous
milk-maid, who&s;e beauty and innocence
might have recommended a wor&s;e draught;
who, while &s;he &s;troked the udder, indulged no
<PB N="441" REF="447">
ambitious thoughts of wandering in palaces,
formed no plans for the de&s;truction of her
fellow-creatures: milk, which is drawn from
the cow, that u&s;eful animal, that eats the
gra&s;s of the field, and &s;upplies us with that
which made the greate&s;t part of the food of
mankind in the age which the poets have
agreed to call golden. It is made with an egg,
that miracle of nature, which the theoretical
Burnet has compared to creation. An egg
contains water within its beautiful &s;mooth &s;ur|face;
and an unformed ma&s;s, by the incubation
of the parent, becomes a regular animal, fur|ni&s;hed
with bones and &s;inews, and covered with
feathers.&mdash;Let us con&s;ider; can there be more
wanting to complete the Meditation on a Pud|ding?
If more is wanting, more may be found.
It contains &s;alt, which keeps the &s;ea from pu|trefaction:
&s;alt, which is made the image of
intellectual excellence, contributes to the for|mation
of a pudding.&endq;</P>
<P>In a magazine I found a &s;aying of Dr.
John&s;on's, &s;omething to this purpo&s;e; that the
happie&s;t part of a man's life is what he pa&s;&s;es
lying awake in bed in the morning. I read it
to him. He &s;aid, &startq;I may, perhaps, have
&s;aid this; for nobody, at times, talks more
laxly than I do.&endq; I ventured to &s;ugge&s;t to
him, that this was dangerous from one of his
authority.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="448">
I &s;poke of living in the country, and upon
what footing one &s;hould be with neighbours. I
ob&s;erved that &s;ome people were afraid of being
on too ea&s;y a footing with them, from an ap|prehen&s;ion
that their time would not be their
own. He made the obvious remark, that it de|pended
much on what kind of neighbours one
has, whether it was de&s;ireable to be on an ea&s;y
footing with them, or not. I mentioned a
certain baronet, who told me, he never was
happy in the country, till he was not on &s;peak|ing
terms with his neighbours, which he con|trived
in different ways to bring about.
&startq;Lord&mdash;(&s;aid he) &s;tuck long;
but at la&s;t the fellow pounded my pigs, and
then I got rid of him.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Nay, &s;ir,
My Lord got rid of Sir John, and &s;hewed how
little he valued him, by putting his pigs in
the pound.&endq;</P>
<P>I told Dr. John&s;on I was in &s;ome difficulty
how to act at Inveraray. I had rea&s;on to think
that the Duche&s;s of Argyle di&s;liked me, on ac|count
of my zeal in the Douglas cau&s;e; but the
Duke of Argyle had always been plea&s;ed to
treat me with great civility. They were now
at the ca&s;tle, which is a very &s;hort walk from
our inn; and the que&s;tion was, whether I &s;hould
go and pay my re&s;pects there? Dr. John&s;on,
to whom I had &s;tated the ca&s;e, was clear
that I ought; but, in his u&s;ual way, he was
<PB N="443" REF="449">
very &s;hy of di&s;covering a de&s;ire to be invited
there him&s;elf. Though, from a conviction of the
benefit of &s;ubordination to &s;ociety, he has always
&s;hewn great re&s;pect to per&s;ons of high rank,
when he happened to be in their company, yet
his pride of character has ever made him guard
again&s;t any appearance of courting the great.
Be&s;ides, he was impatient to get to Gla&s;gow,
where he expected letters. At the &s;ame time
he was, I believe, &s;ecretly not unwilling to
have attention paid him by &s;o great a Chieftain,
and &s;o exalted a nobleman. He in&s;i&s;ted I
&s;hould not go to the ca&s;tle this day before din|ner,
as it would look like &s;eeking an invitation.
&startq;But, &s;aid I, if the duke invites us to dine
with him to-morrow, &s;hall we accept?&endq;&mdash;
&startq;Yes, &s;ir,&endq; I think he &s;aid, &startq; to be &s;ure.&endq;
But, he added, &startq;He won't a&s;k us!&endq;&mdash;I men|tioned,
that I was afraid my company might be
di&s;agreeable to the duche&s;s. He treated this
objection with a manly di&s;dain: &startq; <HI>That,</HI>
&s;ir, he mu&s;t &s;ettle with his wife.&endq;&mdash;We
dined well. I went to the ca&s;tle ju&s;t about the
time when I &s;uppo&s;ed the ladies would be retired
from dinner. I &s;ent in my name; and, being
&s;hewn in, found the amiable duke &s;itting at the
head of his table with &s;everal gentlemen. I was
mo&s;t politely received, and gave his grace &s;ome
particulars of the curious journey which I had
been making with Dr. John&s;on. When we ro&s;e
<PB N="444" REF="450">
from table, the duke &s;aid to me, &startq;I hope you
and Dr. John&s;on will dine with us to-morrow.&endq;
I thanked his grace; but told him, my friend
was in a great hurry to get back to London,
The duke, with a kind complacency, &s;aid,
&startq; He will &s;tay one day; and I will take care
he &s;hall &s;ee this place to advantage.&endq; I &s;aid, I
&s;hould be &s;ure to let him know his grace's in|vitation.
&mdash;As I was going away, the duke &s;aid,
&startq; Mr. Bo&s;well, won't you have &s;ome tea?&endq;&mdash;I
thought it be&s;t to get over the meeting with
the duche&s;s this night; &s;o re&s;pectfully agreed.
I was conducted to the drawing-room by the
duke, who announced my name; but the
duche&s;s, who was &s;itting with her daughter,
Lady Betty Hamilton, and &s;ome other ladies,
took not the lea&s;t notice of me. I &s;hould have
been mortified at being thus coldly re|ceived
by a lady of whom I, with the re&s;t of
the world, have always entertained a very high
admiration, had I not been con&s;oled by the
obliging attention of the duke.</P>
<P>When I returned to the inn, I informed Dr.
John&s;on of the Duke of Argyle's invitation,
with which he was much plea&s;ed, and readily
accepted of it.&mdash;We talked of a violent conte&s;t
which was then carrying on, with a view to the
next general election for Ayr&s;hire; where one
of the candidates, in order to undermine the
old and e&s;tabli&s;hed intere&s;t, had artfully held
<PB N="445" REF="451">
him&s;elf out as a champion for the independency
of the county again&s;t ari&s;tocratick influence,
and had per&s;uaded &s;everal gentlemen into a re|&s;olution
to oppo&s;e every candidate who was
&s;upported by peers.&mdash;&startq;Fooli&s;h fellows! (&s;aid
Dr. John&s;on,) don't they &s;ee that they are as
much dependent upon the peers one way as the
other. The peers have but to <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> a candi|date,
to en&s;ure him &s;ucce&s;s. It is &s;aid, the
only way to make a pig go forward, is to pull
him back by the tail. The&s;e people mu&s;t be
treated like pigs.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>25th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>My acquaintance, the Reverend Mr. John
M'Aulay, one of the mini&s;ters of Inveraray,
and brother to our good friend at Calder, came
to us this morning, and accompanied us to the
ca&s;tle, where I pre&s;ented Dr. John&s;on to the
Duke of Argyle. We were &s;hewn through the
hou&s;e; and I never &s;hall forget the impre&s;&s;ion
made upon my fancy by &s;ome of the ladies'
maids tripping about in neat morning dre&s;&s;es.
After &s;eeing for a long time little but ru&s;ti|city,
their lively manner, and gay inviting ap|pearance,
plea&s;ed me &s;o much, that I thought,
for the moment, I could have been a knight|errant
for them<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">On reflection, at the di&s;tance of &s;everal years, I wonder that my venerable fellow-traveller &s;hould have read this pa&s;&s;age without cen&s;uring my levity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="446" REF="452">
We then got into a low one-hor&s;e chair,
ordered for us by the duke, in which we drove
about the place. Dr. John&s;on was much
&s;truck by the grandeur and elegance of this
princely &s;eat. He &s;aid, &startq;What I admire
here, is the total defiance of expence.&endq; I had
a particular pride in &s;hewing him a great num|ber
of fine old trees, to compen&s;ate for the
nakedne&s;s which had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion
on him on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Scotland.&mdash;He
thought the ca&s;tle too low, and wi&s;hed it had
been a &s;tory higher.</P>
<P>When we came in, before dinner, we found
the duke and &s;ome gentlemen in the hall. Dr.
John&s;on took much notice of the large col|lection
of arms, which are excellently di&s;po&s;ed
there. I told what he had &s;aid to Sir Alex|ander
M^cDonald, of his ance&s;tors not &s;uffering
their arms to ru&s;t. &startq;Well, (&s;aid the doctor,)
but let us be glad we live in times when arms
<HI>may</HI> ru&s;t. We can &s;it to-day at his grace's
table, without any ri&s;k of being attacked, and
perhaps &s;itting down again wounded or
maimed.&endq; The duke placed Dr. John&s;on next
him&s;elf at table. I was in fine &s;pirits; and
though &s;en&s;ible that I had the misfortune of not
being in favour with the duche&s;s, I was not in
the lea&s;t di&s;concerted, and offered her grace
&s;ome of the di&s;h that was before me. It mu&s;t
be owned that I was in the right to be quite
<PB N="447" REF="453">
unconcerned, if I could. I was the Duke of
Argyle's gue&s;t; and I had no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e
that he adopted the prejudices and re&s;entments
of the Duche&s;s of Hamilton.</P>
<P>I knew it was not the rule of modern high
life to drink to any body; but, that I might
have the &s;atisfaction for once to look the
duche&s;s in the face, with a gla&s;s in my hand, I
with a re&s;pectful air addre&s;&s;ed her,&mdash;&startq;My
Lady Duche&s;s, I have the honour to drink
your grace's good health.&endq;&mdash;I repeated the
words audibly, and with a &s;teady countenance.
This was, perhaps, rather too much; but
&s;ome allowance mu&s;t be made for human
feelings.</P>
<P>The duche&s;s was very attentive to Dr. John|&s;on,
I know not how a <HI>middle &s;tate</HI> came to be
mentioned. Her grace wi&s;hed to hear him on
that point. &startq;Madam, (&s;aid he,) your own rela|tion,
Mr. Archibald Campbell, can tell you
better about it than I can. He was a bi&s;hop of
the nonjuring communion, and wrote a book
upon the &s;ubject.&endq;&mdash;He engaged to get it for
her grace. He afterwards gave a full hi&s;tory
of Mr. Archibald Campbell, which I am &s;orry
I do not recollect particularly. He &s;aid, Mr.
Campbell had been bred a violent Whig, but
afterwards, &startq;kept <HI>better company,</HI> and became
a Tory.&endq; He &s;aid this with a &s;mile, in plea&s;ant
allu&s;ion, as I thought, to the oppo&s;ition between
<PB N="448" REF="454">
his own political principles and tho&s;e of the
duke's clan. He added, that Mr. Campbell,
after the Revolution, was thrown into jail on
account of his tenets; but, on application by
letter to the old Lord Town&s;hend, was relea&s;ed:
that he always &s;poke of his lord&s;hip with great
gratitude, &s;aying, &startq;though <HI>a Whig</HI> he had
humanity.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on and I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time together,
in June 1784, at Pembroke college, Oxford,
with the Reverend Dr. Adams, the ma&s;ter;
and I having expre&s;&s;ed a regret that my note
relative to Mr. Archibald Campbell was imper|fect,
he was then &s;o good as to write with his
own hand, on the blank page of my Journal
oppo&s;ite to that which contained what I have
now mentioned, the following paragraph;
which, however, is not quite &s;o full as the
narrative he gave at Inveraray:</P>
<P>&startq; The Honourable Archibald Campbell was, I
believe, the nephew of the Marquis of Argyle.
He began life by engaging in Monmouth's rebellion,
and, to e&s;cape the law, lived &s;ome time in Surinam.
When be returned, he became zealous for epi&s;co|pacy
and monarchy; and at the Revolution adhered
not only to the Nonjurors, but to tho&s;e who refu&s;ed
to communicate with the Church of England, or to
be pre&s;ent at any wor&s;hip where the u&s;urper was
mentioned as king. He was, I believe, more than
once apprehended in the reign of King William,
<PB N="449" REF="455">
and once at the acce&s;&s;ion of George. He was the
familiar friend of Hickes and Nel&s;on; a man of
letters, but injudicious; and very curious and in|qui&s;itive,
but credulous. He lived in 1743, or 44,
about 75 years old.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of luxury was introduced. Dr.
John&s;on defended it. &startq; We have now (&s;aid he,)
a &s;plendid dinner before us; Which of all the&s;e
di&s;hes is unwhole&s;ome?&endq; The duke a&s;&s;erted,
that he had ob&s;erved the grandees of Spain
dimini&s;hed in their &s;ize by luxury. Dr. John|&s;on
politely refrained from oppo&s;ing directly an
ob&s;ervation which the duke him&s;elf had made;
but &s;aid, &startq;Man mu&s;t be very different from
other animals, if he is dimini&s;hed by good
living; for the &s;ize of all other animals is in|crea&s;ed
by it.&endq; I made &s;ome remark that &s;eemed
to imply a belief in <HI>&s;econd &s;ight.</HI> The duche&s;s
&s;aid, &startq;I fancy you will be a <HI>Methodi&s;t.&endq;</HI>&mdash;This
was the only &s;entence her grace deigned to utter
to me; and I take it for granted, &s;he thought it
a good hit on my <HI>credulity</HI> in the Douglas cau&s;e.</P>
<P>A gentleman in company, after dinner, was
de&s;ired by the duke to go to another room, for
a &s;pecimen of curious marble, which his grace
wi&s;hed to &s;hew us. He brought a wrong
piece, upon which the duke &s;ent him back
again. He could not refu&s;e; but, to avoid any
appearance of &s;ervility, he whi&s;tled as he
<PB N="450" REF="456">
walked out of the room, to &s;how his indepen|dency.
On my mentioning this afterwards to
Dr. John&s;on, he &s;aid, it was a nice trait of
character.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on talked a great deal, and was
&s;o entertaining, that Lady Betty Hamilton,
after dinner, went and placed her chair clo&s;e to
his, leaned upon the back of it, and li&s;tened
eagerly. It would have made a fine picture to
have drawn the Sage and her at this time in
their &s;everal attitudes. He did not know, all
the while, how much he was honoured. I told
him afterwards. I never &s;aw him &s;o gentle and
complai&s;ant as this day.</P>
<P>We went to tea. The duke and I walked up
and down the drawing-room, conver&s;ing. The
duche&s;s &s;till continued to &s;hew the &s;ame marked
coldne&s;s for me; for which, though I &s;uffered
from it, I made every allowance, con&s;idering
the very warm part that I had taken for Doug|las,
in the cau&s;e in which &s;he thought her &s;on &s;o
deeply intere&s;ted. Had not her grace di&s;covered
&s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure towards me, I &s;hould have &s;u&s;|pected
her of in&s;en&s;ibility or di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<P>Her grace made Dr. John&s;on come and &s;it by
her, and a&s;ked him why he made his journey
&s;o late in the year. &startq;Why, madam, (&s;aid he,)
you know Mr. Bo&s;well mu&s;t attend the Court of
Se&s;&s;ion, and it does not ri&s;e till the twelfth of
Augu&s;t.&endq;&mdash;She &s;aid, with &s;ome &s;harpne&s;s, &startq; I
<PB N="451" REF="457">
<HI>know nothing</HI> of Mr. Bo&s;well.&endq; Poor Lady
Lucy Douglas, to whom I mentioned this,
ob&s;erved, &startq;She knew <HI>too much</HI> of Mr. Bo&s;well.&endq;
I &s;hall make no remark on her grace's &s;peech.
I indeed felt it as rather too &s;evere; but when
I recollected that my puni&s;hment was inflicted
by &s;o dignified a beauty, I had that kind of
con&s;olation which a man would feel who is
&s;trangled by a <HI>&s;ilken cord.</HI> Dr. John&s;on was all
attention to her grace. He u&s;ed afterwards a
droll expre&s;&s;ion, upon her enjoying the three
titles of Hamilton, Brandon, and Argyle. Bor|rowing
an image from the Turki&s;h empire, he
called her a <HI>Duche&s;s</HI> with <HI>three tails.</HI></P>
<P>He was much plea&s;ed with our vi&s;it at the
ca&s;tle of Inveraray. The Duke of Argyle was
exceedingly polite to him, and, upon his com|plaining
of the &s;helties which he had hitherto
ridden being too &s;mall for him, his grace told
him he &s;hould be provided with a good hor&s;e to
carry him next day.</P>
<P>Mr. John M'Aulay pa&s;sed the evening with
us at out inn. When Dr. John&s;on &s;poke of
people who&s;e principles were good, but who&s;e
practice was faulty, Mr. M'Aulay &s;aid, he had
no notion of people being in earne&s;t in their
good profe&s;&s;ions, who&s;e practice was not &s;uit|able,
The Doctor grew warm, and &s;aid,
&startq; Sir, are you &s;o gro&s;sly ignorant of human
nature, as not to know that a man may be very
&s;incere in good principles, without having good
practice?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="452" REF="458">
Dr. John&s;on was unque&s;tionably in the right;
and whoever examines him&s;elf candidly, will be
&s;atisfied of it, though the incon&s;i&s;tency between
principles and practice is greater in &s;ome men
than in others.</P>
<P>I recollect very little of this night's conver&s;a|tion.
I am &s;orry that indolence came upon me
towards the conclu&s;ion of our journey, &s;o that
I did not write down what pa&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame
a&s;&s;iduity as during the greate&s;t part of it.</P>

<P>Mr. M'Aulay breakfa&s;ted with us, nothing
hurt or di&s;mayed by his la&s;t night's correction.
Being a man of good &s;en&s;e, he had a ju&s;t ad|miration
of Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P>Either ye&s;terday morning, or this, I commu|nicated
to Dr. John&s;on, from Mr. M'Aulay's
information, the news that Dr. Beattie had got
a pen&s;ion of two hundred pounds a year. He
&s;at up in his bed, clapped his hands, and cried,
&startq; O brave we!&endq;&mdash;a peculiar exclamation of his
when he rejoices.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Having mentioned, more than once, that my Journal was peru&s;ed by Dr. John&s;on, I think it proper to inform my readers that this is the la&s;t paragraph which he read.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As we &s;at over our tea, Mr. Home's Tragedy
of <HI>Douglas</HI> was mentioned. I put Dr. John&s;on
in mind, that once, in a coffee-hou&s;e at Oxford,
he called to old Mr. Sheridan, &startq; How came
you, &s;ir, to give Home a gold medal for writing
that fooli&s;h play?&endq; and defied Mr. Sheridan to
<PB N="453" REF="459">
&s;hew ten good lines in it. He did not in&s;i&s;t
they &s;hould be together; but that there were
not ten good lines in the whole play. He now
per&s;i&s;ted in this. I endeavoured to defend that
pathetick and beautiful tragedy, and repeated
the following pa&s;&s;age:
<Q><L>&mdash;&startq;Sincerity,</L>
<L>Thou fir&s;t of virtues! let no mortal leave</L>
<L>Thy onward path, although the earth &s;hould gape,</L>
<L>And from the gulph of hell de&s;truction cry,</L>
<L>To take di&s;&s;imulation's winding way.&endq;</L></Q>
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;That will not do, &s;ir. Nothing is
good but what is con&s;i&s;tent with truth or pro|bability,
which this is not. Juvenal, indeed,
gives us a noble picture of inflexible virtue:&endq;
<Q><L>&startq;E&s;to bonus miles, tutor bonus, arbiter idem</L>
<L>Integer: ambiguae &s;i quando citabere te&s;tis,</L>
<L>Incertaeque rei, Phalaris licet imperet, ut &s;is</L>
<L>Fal&s;us, et admoto dictet perjuria tauro,</L>
<L>Summum crede nefas animam praeferre pudori,</L>
<L>Et propter vitam vivendi perdere cau&s;as.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>He repeated the lines with great force and
dignity; then added, &startq;And, after this, comes
Johnny Home, with his <HI>earth gaping,</HI> and his
<HI>de&s;truction crying:</HI>&mdash;Pooh!&endq;</P>
<P>While we were lamenting the number of
ruined religious buildings which we had lately
&s;een, I &s;poke with peculiar feeling of the mi|&s;erable
neglect of the chapel belonging to the
palace of Holyrood hou&s;e, in which are depo|&s;ited
the remains of many of the Kings of Scot|land,
<PB N="454" REF="460">
and of many of our nobility. I &s;aid, it was
a di&s;grace to the country that it was not re|paired;
and particularly complained that my
friend Douglas, the repre&s;entative of a great
hou&s;e, and proprietor of a va&s;t e&s;tate, &s;hould
&s;uffer the &s;acred &s;pot where his mother lies in|terred,
to be unroofed, and expo&s;ed to all the
inclemencies of the weather. Dr. John&s;on,
who, I know not how, had formed an opinion
on the Hamilton &s;ide, in the Douglas cau&s;e, &s;lily
an&s;wered, &startq;Sir, &s;ir, don't be too &s;evere upon
the gentleman; don't accu&s;e him of want of
filial piety! Lady Jane Douglas was not <HI>his</HI>
mother.&endq;&mdash;He rou&s;ed my zeal &s;o much,
that I took the liberty to tell him he knew no|thing
of the cau&s;e; which I do mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly
believe was the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>We were now &startq;in a country of bridles and
&s;addles,&endq; and &s;et out fully equipped. The
Duke of Argyle was obliging enough to mount
Dr. John&s;on on a &s;tately &s;teed from his grace's
&s;table. My friend was highly plea&s;ed, and
Jo&s;eph &s;aid, &startq;He now looks like a bi&s;hop.&endq;</P>
<P>We dined at the inn at Tarbat, and at night
came to Ro&s;edow, the beautiful &s;eat of Sir James

<P>I am happy to in&s;ert every memorial of the
honour done to my great friend. Indeed, I
was at all times de&s;irous to pre&s;erve the letters
which he received from eminent per&s;ons, of
which, as of all other papers, he was very neg|ligent;
and once propo&s;ed to him, that they
&s;hould be committed to my care, as his <HI>Cu&s;tos
Rotulorum.</HI> I wi&s;h he had complied with my
reque&s;t, as by that means many valuable writ|ings
might have been pre&s;erved, that are now
lo&s;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">As a remarkable in&s;tance of his negligence, I remember &s;ome years ago to have found lying loo&s;e in his &s;tudy, and without the cover which contained the addre&s;s, a letter to him from Lord Thurlow, to whom he had made an application, as Chancellor, in behalf of a poor literary friend. It was ex|pre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch terms of re&s;pect for Dr. John&s;on, that, in my zeal for his reputation. I remon&s;trated warmly with him on his &s;trange in attention, and obtained his permi&s;&s;ion to take a copy of it; by which it has probably been pre&s;erved, as the original I have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e is lo&s;t.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="457" REF="463">
After breakfa&s;t, Dr. John&s;on and I were
furni&s;hed with a boat, and &s;ailed about upon
Lochlomond, and landed on &s;ome of the i&s;lands
which are inter&s;per&s;ed. He was much plea&s;ed
with the &s;cene, which is &s;o well known by the
accounts of various travellers, that it is unne|ce&s;&s;ary
for me to attempt any de&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>I recollect none of his conver&s;ation, except
that, when talking of dre&s;s, he &s;aid, &startq;Sir, were
I to have any thing fine, it &s;hould be very fine.
Were I to wear a ring, it &s;hould not be a
bauble, but a &s;tone of great value. Were I to
wear a laced or embroidered wai&s;tcoat, it
&s;hould be very rich. I had once a very rich
laced wai&s;tcoat, which I wore the fir&s;t night of
my tragedy.&endq;</P>
<P>Lady Helen Colquhoun being a very pious
woman, the conver&s;ation, after dinner, took a
religious turn. Her lady&s;hip defended the
pre&s;byterian mode of publick wor&s;hip; upon
which Dr. John&s;on delivered tho&s;e excellent
arguments for a form of prayer which he has
introduced into his &startq;Journey.&endq; I am my&s;elf
fully convinced that a form of prayer for pub|lick
<PB N="458" REF="464">
wor&s;hip is in general mo&s;t decent and
edifying. <HI>Solennia verba</HI> have a kind of pre|&s;criptive
&s;anctity, and make a deeper impre&s;|&s;ion
on the mind than extemporaneous effu|&s;ions,
in which, as we not know what they are
to be, we cannot readily acquie&s;ce. Yet I
would allow al&s;o of a certain portion of extem|pore
addre&s;s, as occa&s;ion may require. This is
the practice of the French Prote&s;tant churches.
And although the office of forming &s;upplica|tions
to the throne of heaven is, in my mind,
too great a tru&s;t to be indi&s;criminately com|mitted
to the di&s;cretion of every mini&s;ter, I do
not mean to deny, that &s;incere devotion may
be experienced when joining in prayer with
tho&s;e who u&s;e no Liturgy.</P>
<P>We were favoured with Sir James Colqu|houn's
coach to convey us in the evening to
Cameron, the &s;eat of Commi&s;&s;ary Smollet.
Our &s;atisfaction at finding our&s;elves again in a
comfortable carriage was very great. We had
a plea&s;ing conviction of the commodiou&s;ne&s;s of
civilization, and heartily laughed at the
ravings of tho&s;e ab&s;urd vi&s;ionaries who have
attempted to per&s;uade us of the &s;uperior ad|vantages
of a <HI>&s;tate of nature.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Smollet was a man of con&s;iderable
learning, with abundance of animal &s;pirits; &s;o
that he was a very good companion for Dr.
John&s;on, who &s;aid to me, &startq;We have had
<PB N="459" REF="465">
more &s;olid talk here than at any place where
we have been.&endq;</P>
<P>I remember Dr. John&s;on gave us this even|ing
an able and eloquent di&s;cour&s;e on the
<HI>Origin of Evil,</HI> and on the con&s;i&s;tency of moral
evil with the power and goodne&s;s of GOD. He
&s;hewed us how it aro&s;e from our free agency,
an extinction of which would be a &s;till greater
evil than any we experience. I know not that
he &s;aid any thing ab&s;olutely new, but he &s;aid a
great deal wonderfully well; and perceiving us
to be delighted and &s;atisfied, he concluded his
harangue with an air of benevolent triumph
over an objection which has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed many
worthy minds: &startq;This then is the an&s;wer to
the que&s;tion, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">?&endq;&mdash;Mrs. Smollet
whi&s;pered me, that it was the be&s;t &s;ermon &s;he
had ever heard. Much do I upbraid my&s;elf
for having neglected to pre&s;erve it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Thur&s;day, <DATE>28th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. Smollet plea&s;ed Dr. John&s;on, by pro|ducing
a collection of news-papers in the time
of the U&s;urpation, from which it appeared that
all &s;orts of crimes were very frequent during that
horrible anarchy. By the &s;ide of the high road
to Gla&s;gow, at &s;ome di&s;tance from his hou&s;e,
he had erected a pillar to the memory of his
ingenious kin&s;man, Dr. Smollet; and he con|&s;ulted
Dr. John&s;on as to an in&s;cription for it.
<PB N="460" REF="466">
Lord Kames, who, though he had a great &s;tore
of knowledge, with much ingenuity, and un|common
activity of mind, was no profound
&s;cholar, had it &s;eems recommended an Engli&s;h
in&s;cription. Dr. John&s;on treated this with
great contempt, &s;aying, &startq;An Engli&s;h in&s;crip|tion
would be a di&s;grace to Dr. Smollet,&endq; and,
in an&s;wer to what Lord Kames had urged, as
to the advantage of its being in Engli&s;h, be|cau&s;e
it would be generally under&s;tood, I ob|&s;erved,
that all to whom Dr. Smollet's merit
could be an object of re&s;pect and imitation,
would under&s;tand it as well in Latin; and that
&s;urely it was not meant for the Highland dro|vers,
or other &s;uch people, who pa&s;s and repa&s;s
that way.</P>
<P>We were then &s;hewn a Latin in&s;cription,
propo&s;ed for this monument. Dr. John&s;on &s;at
down with an ardent and liberal earne&s;tne&s;s to
revi&s;e it, and made &s;uch additions and variations
as to form it almo&s;t entirely anew. I unfortu|nately
did not take a copy of it, as it originally
&s;tood; but I have happily pre&s;erved every frag|ment
of what Dr. John&s;on wrote:

<P>We had this morning a &s;ingular proof of Dr.
John&s;on's quick and retentive memory. Hay's
tran&s;lation of Martial was lying in a window. I
&s;aid, I thought it was pretty well done, and
&s;hewed him a particular epigram of, I think
ten, but am certain of eight, lines. He read
it, and to&s;&s;ed away the book, &s;aying&mdash;&startq;No,
it is <HI>not</HI> pretty well.&endq; As I per&s;i&s;ted in my
opinion, he &s;aid, &startq;Why, &s;ir,&endq; the original is
thus,&mdash;(and he repeated it;) and this man's
tran&s;lation is thus:&mdash;and then he repeated that
al&s;o, exactly, though he had never &s;een it be|fore,
and read it over only once, and that too,
without any intention of getting it by heart.</P>
<P>Here a po&s;t-chai&s;e, which I had ordered
from Gla&s;gow, came for us, and we drove on
in high &s;pirits. We &s;topped at Dunbarton,
and though the approach to the ca&s;tle there is
very &s;teep, Dr. John&s;on a&s;cended it with ala|crity,
<PB N="462" REF="468">
and &s;urveyed all that was to be &s;een.
During the whole of our Tour he &s;hewed un|common
&s;pirit, could not bear to be treated
like an old or infirm man, and was very un|willing
to accept of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in&s;omuch
that, at our landing on Icolmkill, when Sir
Allan M'Lean and I &s;ubmitted to be carried
on men's &s;houlders from the boat to the &s;hore,
as it could not be brought quite clo&s;e to land,
he &s;prang into the &s;ea, and waded vigorou&s;ly
out.</P>
<P>On our arrival at the Saracen's Head Inn, at
Gla&s;gow, I was made happy by good accounts
from home; and Dr. John&s;on, who had not
received a &s;ingle letter &s;ince we left Aberdeen,
found here a great many, the peru&s;al of which
entertained him much. He enjoyed in ima|gination
the comforts which we could now
command, and &s;eemed to be in high glee. I
remember he put a leg up on each &s;ide of the
grate, and &s;aid, with a mock &s;olemnity, by
way of &s;oliloquy, but loud enough for me to
hear it, &startq;Here am I, an ENGLISH man,
&s;itting by a <HI>coal</HI> fire!&endq;</P>

<P>The profe&s;&s;ors of the univer&s;ity being in|formed
of our arrival, Dr. Steven&s;on, Dr.
Reid, and Mr. Ander&s;on, breakfa&s;ted with us.
Mr. Ander&s;on accompanied us while Dr. John&s;on
<PB N="463" REF="469">
John&s;on viewed this beautiful city. He had
told me, that one day in London, when Dr.
Adam Smith was boa&s;ting of it, he turned to
him and &s;aid, &startq;Pray &s;ir, have you ever &s;een
Brentford?&endq;&mdash;This was &s;urely a &s;trong in&s;tance
of his impatience, and &s;pirit of contradiction.
I put him in mind of it to-day, while he ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his admiration of the elegant buildings,
and whi&s;pered him, &startq;Don't you feel &s;ome re|mor&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>We were received in the college by a num|ber
of the profe&s;&s;ors, who &s;hewed all due
re&s;pect to Dr. John&s;on; and then we paid a
vi&s;it to the principal, Dr. Leechman, at his
own hou&s;e, where Dr. John&s;on had the &s;ati&s;|faction
of being told that his name had been
gratefully celebrated in one of the parochial
congregations in the Highlands, as the per&s;on
to who&s;e influence it was chiefly owing, that
the New Te&s;tament was allowed to be tran&s;lated
into the Er&s;e language. It &s;eems &s;ome politi|cal
members of the Society in Scotland for
propagating Chri&s;tian knowledge, had oppo&s;ed
this pious undertaking, as tending to pre&s;erve
the di&s;tinction between the Highlanders and
Lowlanders. Dr. John&s;on wrote a long letter
upon the &s;ubject to a friend, which being
&s;hewn to them, made them a&s;hamed, and
afraid of being publickly expo&s;ed; &s;o they
were forced to a compliance. It is now in my
<PB N="464" REF="470">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and is perhaps, one of the be&s;t pro|ductions
of his ma&s;terly pen.</P>
<P>Profe&s;&s;ors Reid and Ander&s;on, and the two
Me&s;&s;ieurs Foulis, the Elzevirs of Gla&s;gow,
dined and drank tea with us at our inn, after
which the profe&s;&s;ors went away; and I, having
a letter to write, left my fellow-traveller with
Me&s;&s;ieurs Foulis. Though good and ingenious
men, they had that un&s;ettled &s;peculative mode
of conver&s;ation which is offen&s;ive to a man
regularly taught at an Engli&s;h &s;chool and
univer&s;ity. I found that, in&s;tead of li&s;tening to
the dictates of the Sage, they had teized him
with que&s;tions and doubtful di&s;putations. He
came in a flutter to me, and de&s;ired I might come
back again, for he could not bear the&s;e men.
&startq;O ho! &s;ir, (&s;aid I,) you are flying to me for
refuge!&endq; He never, in any &s;ituation, was at
a lo&s;s for a ready repartee. He an&s;wered, with
quick vivacity, &startq;It is of two evils choo&s;ing
the lea&s;t.&endq; I was delighted with this fla&s;h
bur&s;ting from the cloud which hung upon his
mind, clo&s;ed my letter directly, and joined
the company.</P>
<P>We &s;upped at profe&s;&s;or Ander&s;on's. The
general impre&s;&s;ion upon my memory is, that
we had not much conver&s;ation at Gla&s;gow,
where the profe&s;&s;ors, like their bretheren at
Aberdeen, did not venture to expo&s;e them|&s;elves
much to the battery of cannon which
<PB N="465" REF="471">
they knew might play upon them. Dr. John|&s;on,
who was fully con&s;cious of his own &s;upe|rior
powers, afterwards prai&s;ed Principal
Robert&s;on for his caution in this re&s;pect. He
&s;aid to me, &startq;Robert&s;on, &s;ir, was in the right.
Robert&s;on is a man of eminence, and the head
of a college at Edinburgh. He had a cha|racter
to maintain, and did well not to ri&s;k its
being le&s;&s;ened.&endq;</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>30th October.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>We &s;et out towards Ayr&s;hire. I &s;ent Jo&s;eph
on to <HI>Loudoun,</HI> with a me&s;&s;age, that, if the earl
was at home; Dr. John&s;on and I would have
the honour to dine with him. Jo&s;eph met us
on the road, and reported that the earl &startq;<HI>jumped
for joy,</HI>&endq; and &s;aid, &startq;I &s;hall be very happy
to &s;ee them.&endq;&mdash;We were received with a mo&s;t
plea&s;ing courte&s;y by his lord&s;hip, and by the
counte&s;s his mother, who, in her ninety-fifth
year, had all her faculties quite unimpaired.
This was a very cheering &s;ight to Dr. John&s;on,
who had an extraordinary de&s;ire for long life.
Her lady&s;hip was &s;en&s;ible and well-informed,
and had &s;een a great deal of the world. Her
lord had held &s;everal high offices, and &s;he was
&s;i&s;ter to the great Earl of Stair.</P>
<P>I cannot here refrain from paying a ju&s;t tri|bute
to the character of John Earl of Loudoun,
who did more &s;ervice to the county of Ayr in
<PB N="466" REF="472">
general, as well as to individuals in it, than any
man we have ever had. It is painful to think
that he met with much ingratitude from per|&s;ons
both in high and low rank: but &s;uch was
his temper, &s;uch his knowledge of &startq;ba&s;e man|kind
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The unwilling gratitude of ba&s;e mankind. POPE.</NOTE>,&endq; that, as if he had expected no other
return, his mind was never &s;oured, and he
retained his good-humour and benevolence to
the la&s;t. The tenderne&s;s of his heart was
proved in 1745-6, when he had an important
command in the Highlands, and behaved with
a generous humanity to the unfortunate. I
cannot figure a more hone&s;t politician; for,
though his intere&s;t in our county was great,
and had been generally &s;ucce&s;sful, he not only
did not deceive by fallacious promi&s;es, but was
anxious that people &s;hould not deceive them|&s;elves
by too &s;anguine expectations. His kind
and dutiful attention to his mother was unre|mitted.
At his hou&s;e was true ho&s;pitality; a
plain but a plentiful table; and every gue&s;t,
being left at perfect freedom, felt him&s;elf quite
ea&s;y and happy. While I live, I &s;hall honour
the memory of this amiable man.</P>
<P>At night, we advanced a few miles farther,
to the hou&s;e of Mr. Campbell of Tree&s;bank,
who was married to one of my wife's &s;i&s;ters, and
were entertained very agreeably by a worthy
couple.</P>

<P>We repo&s;ed here in tranquillity. Dr. John|&s;on
was plea&s;ed to find a numerous and excel|lent
collection of books, which had mo&s;tly
belonged to the Reverend Mr. John Campbell,
brother of our ho&s;t. I was de&s;irous to have
procured for my fellow-traveller, to-day, the
company of Sir John Cuninghame, of Capring|ton,
who&s;e ca&s;tle was but two miles from us.
He was a very di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;cholar, was long
abroad, and part of the time lived much with
the learned Cuninghame, the opponent of Bent|ley
as a critick upon Horace. He wrote Latin
with great elegance, and, what is very remark|able,
read Homer and Ario&s;to through, every
year. I wrote to him, to reque&s;t he would
come to us; but unfortunately he was pre|vented
by indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>

<P>Though Dr. John&s;on was lazy, and aver&s;e to
move, I in&s;i&s;ted that he &s;hould go with me, and
pay a vi&s;it to the Counte&s;s of Eglintoune, mo|ther
of the late and pre&s;ent earl. I a&s;&s;ured
him, he would find him&s;elf amply recompen&s;ed
for the trouble; and he yielded to my &s;olicita|tions,
though with &s;ome unwillingne&s;s. We
were well mounted, and had not many miles
to ride. He talked of the attention that is
<PB N="468" REF="474">
nece&s;&s;ary in order to di&s;tribute our charity
judiciou&s;ly. &startq;If thoughtle&s;sly done, we may
neglect the mo&s;t de&s;erving objects; and, as
every man has but a certain proportion to give,
if it is lavi&s;hed upon tho&s;e who fir&s;t pre&s;ent
them&s;elves, there may be nothing left for &s;uch
as have a better claim. A man &s;hould fir&s;t
relieve tho&s;e who are nearly connected with
him, by whatever tie; and then, if he has any
thing to &s;pare, may extend his bounty to a
wider circle.&endq;</P>
<P>As we pa&s;&s;ed very near the ca&s;tle of Dun|donald,
which was one of the many re&s;idencies
of the kings of Scotland, and in which,
Robert the Third was born, Dr. John&s;on
wi&s;hed to &s;urvey it particularly. It &s;tands on
a beautiful ri&s;ing ground, which is &s;een at a
great di&s;tance on &s;everal quarters, and from
whence there is an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of the
rich di&s;trict of Cuninghame, the we&s;tern &s;ea,
and the I&s;le of Arran. It has long been un|roofed;
and, though of con&s;iderable &s;ize, we
could not, by any power of imagination,
figure it as having been a &s;uitable habitation
for maje&s;ty. Dr. John&s;on, to irritate my <HI>old
Scotti&s;h</HI> enthu&s;ia&s;m, was very jocular on the
homely accommodation of &startq;King <HI>Bob,</HI>&endq; and
roared and laughed till the ruins echoed.</P>
<P>Lady Eglintoune, though &s;he was now in
her eighty-fifth year, and had lived in the
<PB N="469" REF="475">
retirement of the country for almo&s;t half a
century, was &s;till a very agreeable woman.
She was of the noble hou&s;e of Kennedy, and
had all the elevation which the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
&s;uch birth in&s;pires. Her figure was maje&s;tick,
her manners high-bred, her reading exten&s;ive,
and her conver&s;ation elegant. She had been
the admiration of the gay circles of life, and
the patrone&s;s of poets. Dr. John&s;on was de|lighted
with his reception here. Her princi|ples
in church and &s;tate were congenial with
his. She knew all his merit, and had heard
much of him from her &s;on, Earl Alexander,
who loved to cultivate the acquaintance of
men of talents, in every department.</P>
<P>All who knew his lord&s;hip, will allow that
his under&s;tanding and accompli&s;hments were of
no ordinary rate. From the gay habits which
he had early acquired, he &s;pent too much of his
time with men, and in pur&s;uits, far beneath
&s;uch a mind as his. He afterwards became
&s;en&s;ible of it, and turned his thoughts to
objects of importance; but was cut off in the
prime of his life. I cannot &s;peak, but with
emotions of the mo&s;t affectionate regret, of one,
in who&s;e company many of my early days
were pa&s;&s;ed, and to who&s;e kindne&s;s I was
much indebted.</P>
<P>Often mu&s;t I have occa&s;ion to upbraid my|&s;elf,
that, &s;oon after our return to the main
<PB N="470" REF="476">
land, I allowed indolence to prevail over me &s;o
much, as to &s;hrink from the labour of conti|nuing
my Journal with the &s;ame minutene&s;s as
before; &s;heltering my&s;elf in the thought, that
we had done with the <HI>Hebrides;</HI> and not con&s;i|dering,
that Dr. John&s;on's <HI>Memorabilia</HI> were
likely to be the more valuable when we were
re&s;tored to a more poli&s;hed &s;ociety. Much
has thus been irrecoverably lo&s;t.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of our conver&s;ation this day, it
came out, that Lady Eglintoune was married
the year before Dr. John&s;on was born; upon
which &s;he graciou&s;ly &s;aid to him, that &s;he
might have been his mother, and that &s;he now
adopted him; and when we were going away,
&s;he embraced him, &s;aying, &startq;My dear &s;on,
farewell!&endq;&mdash;My friend was much plea&s;ed with
this day's entertainment, and owned that I had
done well to force him out.</P>

<P>We were now in a country not only &startq;<HI>of
&s;addles and bridles,</HI>&endq; but of po&s;t-chai&s;es; and
having ordered one from Kilmarnock, we got
to Auchinleck before dinner.</P>
<P>My father was not quite a year and a half
older than Dr. John&s;on; but his con&s;cientious
di&s;charge of his laborious duty as a judge in
Scotland, where the law proceedings are al|mo&s;t
all in writing,&mdash;a &s;evere complaint which
<PB N="471" REF="477">
ended in his death,&mdash;and the lo&s;s of my mother,
a woman of almo&s;t unexampled piety and
goodne&s;s,&mdash;had before this time in &s;ome degree
affected his &s;pirits, and rendered him le&s;s di&s;|po&s;ed
to exert his faculties: for he had origi|nally
a very &s;trong mind, and cheerful temper.
He a&s;&s;ured me he never had felt one moment of
what is called low &s;pirits, or unea&s;ine&s;s without
a real cau&s;e. He had a great many good
&s;tories, which he told uncommonly well, and he
was remarkable for &startq;humour, <HI>incolumi gravitate,</HI>&endq;
as Lord Monboddo u&s;ed to characteri&s;e it.
His age, his office, and his character, had
long given him an acknowledged claim to
great attention, in whatever company he was;
and he could ill brook any diminution of it.
He was as &s;anguine a Whig and pre&s;byterian,
as Dr. John&s;on was a Tory, and church of
England man: and as he had not much lei&s;ure
to be informed of Dr. John&s;on's great merits,
by reading his works, he had a partial and un|favourable
notion of him, founded on his &s;up|po&s;ed
political tenets; which were &s;o di&s;cordant
to his own, that, in&s;tead of &s;peaking of him
with that re&s;pect to which he was entitled, he
u&s;ed to call him &startq;a <HI>Jacobite fellow.</HI>&endq; Know|ing
all this, I &s;hould not have ventured to
bring them together, had not my father, out
of kindne&s;s to me, de&s;ired me to invite Dr.
John&s;on to his hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="478">
I was very anxious that all &s;hould be well;
and begged of my friend to avoid three topicks,
as to which they differed very widely; Whig|gi&s;m,
Pre&s;byteriani&s;m, and&mdash;Sir John Pringle.
He &s;aid courteou&s;ly, &startq;I &s;hall certainly not
talk on &s;ubjects which I am told are di&s;agree|able
to a gentleman under who&s;e roof I am;
e&s;pecially, I &s;hall not do &s;o to <HI>your father.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t day went off very &s;moothly. It
rained, and we could not get out; but my
father &s;hewed Dr. John&s;on his library, which,
in curious editions of the Greek and Roman
cla&s;&s;icks is, I &s;uppo&s;e, not excelled by any
private collection in Great Britain. My father
had &s;tudied at Leyden, and been very intimate
with the Gronovii, and other learned men
there. He was a &s;ound &s;cholar, and, in par|ticular,
had collated manu&s;cripts and different
editions of Anacreon, and others of the Greek
Lyrick poets, with great care; &s;o that my
friend and he had much matter for conver&s;ation
without touching on the fatal topicks of differ|ence.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on found here Baxter's <HI>Anacreon,</HI>
which he told me he had long inquired for in
vain, and began to &s;u&s;pect there was no &s;uch
book. Baxter was the keen antagoni&s;t of
Barnes. His Life is in the <HI>Biographia Britan|nica.</HI>
My father has written many notes on
this book, and Dr. John&s;on and I talked of
having it reprinted.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="473" REF="479">
<HEAD>Wedne&s;day, <DATE>3d November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>It rained all day, and gave Dr. John&s;on an
impre&s;&s;ion of that incommodiou&s;ne&s;s of climate
in the we&s;t, of which he has taken notice in
his &startq;Journey;&endq; but, being well accommodated,
and furni&s;hed with variety of books, he was not
di&s;&s;ati&s;fied.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen of the neighbourhood came
to vi&s;it my father; but there was little con|ver&s;ation.
One of them a&s;ked Dr. John&s;on,
how he liked the Highlands. The que&s;tion
&s;eemed to irritate him, for he an&s;wered, &startq;How,
&s;ir, can you a&s;k me what obliges me to &s;peak
unfavourably of a country where I have been
ho&s;pitably entertained? Who <HI>can</HI> like the
Highlands?&mdash;I like the inhabitants very well.&endq;
&mdash;The gentlemen a&s;ked no more que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Let me now make up for pre&s;ent neglect,
by again gleaning from the pa&s;t. At Lord
Monboddo's, after the conver&s;ation upon the
decrea&s;e of learning in England, his lord&s;hip
mentioned <HI>Hermes</HI> by Mr. Harris of Sali&s;bury,
as the work of a living authour, for whom he
had a great re&s;pect. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid nothing
at the time; but when we were in our po&s;t|chai&s;e,
told me, he thought Harris &startq;a coxcomb.&endq;
This he &s;aid of him, not as a man, but as an
authour; and I give his opinions of men and
books, faithfully, whether they agree with my
<PB N="474" REF="480">
own, or not. I do admit, that there always
appeared to me &s;omething of affectation in
Mr. Harris's manner of writing; &s;omething of
a habit of clothing plain thoughts in analytick
and categorical formality. But all his writings
are imbued with learning; and all breathe
that philanthropy and amiable di&s;po&s;ition,
which di&s;tingui&s;hed him as a man<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This gentleman, though devoted to the &s;tudy of grammar and dia$ecticks, was not &s;o ab&s;orbed in it as to be without a &s;en&s;e of plea&s;antry, or to be offended at his favourite topicks being treated lightly. I one day met him in the &s;treet, as I was ha&s;tening to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and told him, I was &s;orry I could not &s;top, being rather too late to attend an appeal of the Duke of Hamilton again&s;t Douglas. &startq;I thought (&s;aid he) their conte&s;t had been over long ago.&endq; I an&s;wered, &startq;The conte&s;t concerning Douglas's filiation was over long ago; but the conte&s;t now is, who &s;hall have the e&s;tate.&endq; Then, a&s;&s;uming the air of &startq;an ancient &s;age philo&s;opher,&endq; I proceeded thus: &startq;Were I to <HI>predicate</HI> concerning him, I &s;hould &s;ay, the conte&s;t formerly was, What <HI>is</HI> he? The conte&s;t now is, What <HI>has</HI> he?&endq;&mdash;&startq;Right, (replied Mr. Harris, &s;miling,) you have done with <HI>quality,</HI> and have got into <HI>quantity.</HI>&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At another time, during our Tour, he drew
the character of a rapacious Highland Chief,
with the &s;trength of Theophra&s;tus or La Bruyere;
concluding with the&s;e words: &startq;Sir, he has no
more the &s;oul of a Chief, than an attorney who
has twenty hou&s;es in a &s;treet, and con&s;iders
how much he can make by them.&endq;</P>
<P>He this day, when we were by our&s;elves,
ob&s;erved, how common it was for people to
talk from books; to retail the &s;entiments of
<PB N="475" REF="481">
others, and not their own; in &s;hort, to conver&s;e
without any originality of thinking. He was
plea&s;ed to &s;ay, &startq;You and I do not talk from
books.&endq;</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>Thur&s;day, <DATE>4th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I was glad to have at length a very fine day,
on which I could &s;hew Dr. John&s;on the <HI>Place</HI> of
my family, which he has honoured with &s;o
much attention in his &startq;Journey.&endq; He is,
however, mi&s;taken in thinking that the Cel|tick
name, <HI>Auchinleck,</HI> has no relation to the
natural appearance of it. I believe every Cel|tick
name of a place will be found very de|&s;criptive.
<HI>Auchinleck</HI> does not &s;ignify a <HI>&s;tony
field,</HI> as he has &s;aid, but a <HI>field of flag-&s;tones;</HI> and
this place has a number of rocks, which
abound in &s;trata of that kind. The &startq;&s;ullen
dignity of the old ca&s;tle,&endq; as he has forcibly
expre&s;&s;ed it, delighted him exceedingly. On
one &s;ide of the rock on which its ruins &s;tand,
runs the river <HI>Lugar,</HI> which is here of con&s;ider|able
breadth, and is bordered by other high
rocks, &s;haded, with wood. On the other &s;ide
runs a brook, &s;kirted in the &s;ame manner, but
on a &s;maller &s;cale. It is impo&s;&s;ible to figure
a more romantick &s;cene.</P>
<P>I felt my&s;elf elated here, and expatiated to
my illu&s;trious Mentor on the antiquity and ho|nourable
alliances of my family, and on the
<PB N="476" REF="482">
merits of its founder, Thomas Bo&s;well, who
was highly favoured by his &s;overeign, James IV.
of Scotland, and fell with him at the battle of
Floddon-field; and, in the glow of what, I am
&s;en&s;ible, will, in a commercial age, be con&s;idered
as genealogical enthu&s;ia&s;m, did not omit to
mention, what I was &s;ure my friend would not
think lightly of, my relation to the Royal Per|&s;onage,
who&s;e liberality, on his acce&s;&s;ion to the
throne, had given him comfort and indepen|dence.
I have, in a former page, acknowledged
my pride of ancient blood, in which I was en|couraged
by Dr. John&s;on: my readers therefore
will not be &s;urprized at my having indulged it
on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Not far from the old ca&s;tle is a &s;pot of con|&s;ecrated
earth, on which may be traced the
foundations of an ancient chapel, dedicated to
St. Vincent, and where, in old times, was the
&startq;place of graves&endq; for the family. It grieves
me to think that the remains of &s;anctity here,
which were con&s;iderable, were dragged away,
and employed in building a part of the hou&s;e of
Auchinleck, of the middle age; which was the
family re&s;idence, till my father erected that
&startq;elegant modern man&s;ion,&endq; of which Dr.
John&s;on &s;peaks &s;o hand&s;omely. Perhaps this
chapel may one day be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on was plea&s;ed, when I &s;hewed him
&s;ome venerable old trees, under the &s;hade of
<PB N="477" REF="483">
which my ance&s;tors had walked. He exhorted
me to plant a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, as my father had done
to a great extent.</P>
<P>As I wandered with my revered friend in
the groves of Auchinleck, I told him, that, if
I &s;urvived him, it was my intention to erect a
monument to him here, among &s;cenes which,
in my mind, were all cla&s;&s;ical; for in my
youth I had appropriated to them many of
the de&s;criptions of the Roman poets. He could
not bear to have death pre&s;ented to him in any
&s;hape; for, his con&s;titutional melancholy made
the king of terrors more frightful. He
turned off the &s;ubject, &s;aying, &startq;Sir, I hope to
&s;ee your grand-children.!&endq;</P>
<P>This forenoon he ob&s;erved &s;ome cattle with|out
horns, of which he has taken notice in his
&startq;Journey,&endq; and &s;eems undecided whether they
be of a particular race. My learned friend's
doubts appear to have had no foundation; for
my re&s;pectable neighbour, Mr. Fairlie, who,
with all his attention to agriculture, finds time
both for the cla&s;&s;icks and his friends, a&s;&s;ures
me they are a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, and that, when
any of their calves have horns, a mixture of
breed can be traced. In confirmation of his
opinion, he pointed out to me the following
pa&s;&s;age in Tacitus,&mdash;&startq;<HI>Ne armentis quidem &s;uus
honor, aut gloria frontis;</HI>&endq; (De mor. Germ. &sect; 5.)
which he wondered had e&s;caped Dr. John&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="484">
On the front of the hou&s;e of Auchinleck is
this in&s;cription:
<Q><L>&mdash;Quod petis, hic e&s;t;</L>
<L>E&s;t Ulubris; animus &s;i te non deficit aequus.</L></Q>
It is characteri&s;tick of the founder; but the
<HI>animus aequus</HI> is, alas! not inheritable, nor the
&s;ubject of devi&s;e. He always talked to me as
if it were in a man's own power to attain it;
but Dr. John&s;on told me that he owned to him,
when they were alone, his per&s;ua&s;ion that it was
in a great mea&s;ure con&s;titutional, or the effect
of cau&s;es which do not depend on our&s;elves,
and that Horace boa&s;ts too much, when he &s;ays,
<HI>aequum mi animum ip&s;e parabo.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Friday, <DATE>5th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>The Reverend Mr. Dun, our pari&s;h mini&s;ter,
who had dined with us ye&s;terday, with &s;ome
other company, in&s;i&s;ted that Dr. John&s;on and
I &s;hould dine with him to-day. This gave me
an opportunity to &s;hew my friend the road to
the church, made by my father at a great ex|pence,
for above three miles, through a range
of well enclo&s;ed farms, with a row of trees on
each &s;ide of it. He called it the <HI>Via &s;acra,</HI> and
was very fond of it. Mr. Dun, though a man
of &s;incere good principles, as a pre&s;byterian
divine, di&s;covered a narrowne&s;s of information
concerning the dignitaries of the church of
England, among whom may be found men
<PB N="479" REF="485">
of the greate&s;t learning, virtue, and piety, and
of a truly apo&s;tolick character. He talked
before Dr. John&s;on, of fat bi&s;hops and drow&s;y
deans; and, in &s;hort, &s;eemed to believe the
illiberal and profane &s;coffings of profe&s;&s;ed &s;aty|ri&s;ts,
or vulgar railers. Dr. John&s;on was &s;o
highly offended, that he &s;aid to him, &startq;Sir,
you know no more of our church than a
Hottentot.&endq;&mdash;I was &s;orry that he brought this
upon him&s;elf.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Saturday, <DATE>6th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I cannot be certain, whether it was this
day, or a former, that Dr. John&s;on and my
father came in colli&s;ion. If I recollect right,
the conte&s;t began while my father was &s;hewing
him his collection of medals; and Oliver
Cromwell's coin unfortunately introduced
Charles the Fir&s;t, and Toryi&s;m. They be|came
exceedingly warm, and violent, and I
was very much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by being pre&s;ent at
&s;uch an altercation between two men, both of
whom I reverenced; yet I dur&s;t not interfere.
It would certainly be very unbecoming in me
to exhibit my honoured father, and my
re&s;pected friend, as intellectual gladiators, for
the entertainment of the publick; and there|fore
I &s;uppre&s;s what would, I dare &s;ay, make
an intere&s;ting &s;cene in this dramatick &s;ketch,&mdash;
<PB N="480" REF="486">
this account of the tran&s;it of John&s;on over the
Caledonian Hemi&s;phere.</P>
<P>Yet I think I may, without impropriety,
mention one circum&s;tance, as an in&s;tance of
my father's addre&s;s. Dr. John&s;on challenged
him, as he did us all at Tali&s;ker, to point out
any theological works of merit written by Pre&s;|byterian
mini&s;ters in Scotland. My father,
who&s;e &s;tudies did not lie much in that way,
owned to me afterwards, him&s;elf, that he was
&s;omewhat at a lo&s;s how to an&s;wer, but that
luckily he recollected having read in catalogues
the title of <HI>Durham on the Galatians;</HI> upon
which he boldly &s;aid, &startq;Pray, &s;ir, have you
read Mr. Durham's excellent commentary on
the Galatians?&endq;&mdash;&startq;No, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid Dr. John|&s;on.
By this lucky thought my father kept
him at bay, and for &s;ome time enjoyed his
triumph; but his antagoni&s;t &s;oon made a re|tort,
which I forbear to mention.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of their altercation, Whiggi&s;m
and Pre&s;byteriani&s;m, Toryi&s;m and Epi&s;co|pacy,
were terribly buffeted. My worthy
hereditary friend, Sir John Pringle, never
having been mentioned, happily e&s;caped with|out
a brui&s;e.</P>
<P>My father's opinion of Dr. John&s;on may be
conjectured from the name he afterwards gave
him, which was URSA MAJOR. But it is not
true, as has been reported, that it was in con|&s;equence
<PB N="481" REF="487">
of my &s;aying that he was a <HI>con&s;tellation</HI>
of genius and literature. It was a &s;ly abrupt
expre&s;&s;ion to one of his bretheren on the bench
of the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, in which Dr. John&s;on
was then &s;tanding; but it was not &s;aid in his
hearing.</P>

our pari&s;h-church, in which I regretted that
Dr. John&s;on would not join us; for, though we
have there no form of prayer, nor magnificent
&s;olemnity, yet, as GOD is wor&s;hipped in &s;pirit
and in truth, and the &s;ame doctrines preached
as in the church of England, my friend would
certainly have &s;hewn more liberality, had he
attended. I doubt not, however, but he em|ployed
his time in private to very good pur|po&s;e.
His uniform and &s;ervant piety was ma|nife&s;ted
on many occa&s;ions during our Tour,
which I have not mentioned.&mdash;His rea&s;on for
not joining in Pre&s;byterian wor&s;hip, has been
recorded in a former page<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P. 12$.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>Monday, <DATE>8th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the altercation that had
pa&s;&s;ed, my father who had the dignified cour|te&s;y
of an old Baron, was very civil to Dr.
John&s;on, and politely attended him to the
po&s;t-chai&s;e, which was to convey us to Edin|burgh.</P>
<P><PB N="482" REF="488">
Thus they parted.&mdash;They are now in ano|ther,
and a higher, &s;tate of exi&s;tence: and as
they were both worthy chri&s;tian men, I tru&s;t
they have met in happine&s;s. But I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve,
in ju&s;tice to my friend's political princi|ples,
and my own, that they have met in a
place where there is no room for <HI>Whiggi&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>We came at night to a good inn at Hamil|ton.
&mdash;I recollect no more.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Tue&s;day, <DATE>9th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>I wi&s;hed to have &s;hewn Dr. John&s;on the
Duke of Hamilton's hou&s;e, commonly called
the <HI>Palace</HI> of Hamilton, which is clo&s;e by the
town. It is an object which, having been
pointed out to me as a &s;plendid edifice, from my
earlie&s;t years, in travelling between Auchinleck
and Edinburgh, has &s;till great grandeur in my
imagination. My friend con&s;ented to &s;top, and
view the out&s;ide of it, but could not be per|&s;uaded
to go into it.</P>
<P>We arrived this night at Edinburgh, after
an ab&s;ence of eighty-three days. For five
weeks together, of the tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;on,
there had been no account received of us. I
cannot expre&s;s how happy I was on finding
my&s;elf again at home.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Wedne&s;day, <DATE>10th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Old Mr. Drummond, the book&s;eller, came
to breakfa&s;t. Dr. John&s;on and he had not met
for ten years. There was re&s;pect on his &s;ide,
<PB N="483" REF="489">
and kindne&s;s on Dr. John&s;on's. Soon afterwards
Lord Elibank came in, and was much plea&s;ed
at &s;eeing Dr. John&s;on in Scotland. His lord|&s;hip
&s;aid, &startq;hardly any thing &s;eemed to him
more improbable.&endq; Dr. John&s;on had a very
high opinion of him. Speaking of him to me,
he characterized him thus: &startq;Lord Elibank
has read a great deal. It is true, I can find in
books all that he has read; but he has a
great deal of what is in books, proved by the
te&s;t of real life.&endq;&mdash;Indeed, there have been few
men who&s;e conver&s;ation di&s;covered more know|ledge
enlivened by fancy. He publi&s;hed &s;e|veral
&s;mall pieces of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit; and
has left &s;ome in manu&s;cript, in particular an
account of the expedition again&s;t Carthagena,
in which he &s;erved as an officer in the army.
His writings de&s;erve to be collected. He was
the early patron of Dr. Robert&s;on, the hi&s;torian,
and Mr. Home, the tragick poet; who, when
they were mini&s;ters of country pari&s;hes, lived
near his &s;eat. He told me, &startq;I &s;aw the&s;e lads
had talents, and they were much with me.&endq;&mdash;
I hope they will pay a grateful tribute to his
memory.</P>
<P>The morning was chiefly taken up by Dr.
John&s;on's giving him an an account of our
Tour.&mdash;The &s;ubject of difference in political
principles was introduced.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;It is
much increa&s;ed by oppo&s;ition. There was a
<PB N="484" REF="490">
violent Whig, with whom I u&s;ed to contend
with great eagerne&s;s. After his death I felt
my Toryi&s;m much abated.&endq;&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e he
meant Mr. Walm&s;ley, of Lichfield, who&s;e
character he has drawn &s;o well in his Life of
Edmund Smith.</P>
<P>Mr. Nairne came in, and he and I accompa|nied
Dr. John&s;on to Edinburgh ca&s;tle, which he
owned was &startq;a great place.&endq; But I mu&s;t
mention, as a &s;triking in&s;tance of that &s;pirit of
contradiction to which he had a &s;trong pro|pen&s;ity,
when Lord Elibank was &s;ome days
after talking of it with the natural elation of a
Scotchman, or of any man who is proud of a
&s;tately fortre&s;s in his own country, Dr. John&s;on
affected to de&s;pi&s;e it, ob&s;erving, that &startq;it would
make a good <HI>pri&s;on</HI> in ENGLAND.&endq;</P>
<P>Le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed that I have &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed
one of his &s;allies again&s;t my country,
it may not be improper here to correct a mi&s;|taken
account that has been circulated, as to
his conver&s;ation this day. It has been &s;aid,
that, being de&s;ired to attend to the noble pro&s;|pect
from the Ca&s;tle-hill, he replied, &startq;Sir, the
noble&s;t pro&s;pect that a Scotchman ever &s;ees, is
the high road that leads him to London.&endq;&mdash;
This lively &s;arca&s;m was thrown out at a tavern
in London, in my pre&s;ence, many years before.</P>
<P>We had with us to-day at dinner, at my
hou&s;e, the Lady Dowager Colvill, and Lady
<PB N="485" REF="491">
Anne Er&s;kine, &s;i&s;ters of the Earl of Kelly; the
Honourable Archibald Er&s;kine, who has now
&s;ucceeded to that title; Lord Elibank; the
Reverend Dr. Blair; Mr. Tytler, the acute
vindicator of Mary Queen of Scots, and his
&s;on, the advocate.</P>
<P><HI>Fingal</HI> being talked of, Dr. John&s;on, who u&s;ed
to boa&s;t that he had, from the fir&s;t, re&s;i&s;ted both
O&s;&s;ian and the Giants of Patagonia, averred
his po&s;itive di&s;belief of its authenticity. Lord
Elibank &s;aid, &startq;I am &s;ure it is not M'Pher&s;on's.
Mr. John&s;on, I keep company a great deal with
you; it is known I do. I may borrow from
you better things than I can &s;ay my&s;elf, and
give them as my own; but, if I &s;hould, every
body will know who&s;e they are.&endq;&mdash;The Doctor
was not &s;oftened by this compliment. He de|nied
merit to <HI>Fingal,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing it to be the
production of a man who has had the advan|tages
that the pre&s;ent age affords; and &s;aid,
&startq;nothing is more ea&s;y than to write enough
in that &s;tyle, if once you begin<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I de&s;ire not to be under&s;tood as agreeing <HI>entirely</HI> with the opinions of Dr. John&s;on, which I relate without any remark. The many imitations, however, of <HI>Fingal,</HI> that have been publi&s;hed, confirm this ob&s;ervation in a con&s;iderable degree.</NOTE>.&endq;&mdash;Young
Mr. Tytler &s;tepped bri&s;kly forward, and &s;aid,
&startq;<HI>Fingal</HI> is certainly genuin; for I have heard
a great part of it repeated in the original.&endq;&mdash;
<PB N="486" REF="492">
Dr. John&s;on indignantly a&s;ked him, &startq;Sir, do
you under&s;tand the original?&endq;&mdash;<HI>Tytler.</HI> &startq;No,
&s;ir.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why, then, we &s;ee to what
this te&s;timony comes:&mdash;Thus it is.&endq;&mdash;He af|terwards
&s;aid to me, &startq;Did you ob&s;erve the
wonderful confidence with which young Tytler
advanced, with his front ready <HI>bra&s;ed?</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>I mention this as a remarkable proof how
liable the mind of man is to credulity, when
not guarded by &s;uch &s;trict examination as that
which Dr. John&s;on habitually practi&s;ed. This
gentleman's talents and integrity are unque&s;|tionable;
yet, had not Dr. John&s;on made
him advert to the con&s;ideration, that he who
does not under&s;tand a language, cannot know
that &s;omething which is recited to him is in
that language, he might have believed, and
reported to this hour, that he had &startq;heard a
great part of <HI>Fingal</HI> repeated in the original.&endq;</P>
<P>For the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e on the north of
the Tweed, who may think Dr. John&s;on's ac|count
of Caledonian credulity and inaccuracy
too &s;trong, it is but fair to add, that he
admitted the &s;ame kind of ready belief might
be found in his own country. &startq;He would un|dertake
(he &s;aid) to write an epick poem on
the &s;tory of <HI>Robin Hood,</HI> and half England, to
whom the names and places he &s;hould mention
in it are familiar, would believe and declare
they had heard it from their earlie&s;t years.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="493">
One of his objections to the authenticity of
<HI>Fingal,</HI> during the conver&s;ation at Ulini&s;h, is
omitted in my Journal, but I perfectly recol|lect
it.&mdash;&startq;Why is not the original depo&s;ited in
&s;ome publick library, in&s;tead of exhibiting
atte&s;tations of its exi&s;tence? Suppo&s;e there
were a que&s;tion in a court of ju&s;tice, whether a
man be dead or alive: You aver he is alive,
and you bring fifty witne&s;&s;es to &s;wear it: I
an&s;wer, Why do you not produce the man?&endq;
&mdash;This is an argument founded on one of the
fir&s;t principles of the <HI>law of evidence,</HI> which
<HI>Gilbert</HI> would have held to be irrefragable.</P>
<P>I do not think it incumbent on me to give
any preci&s;e decided opinion upon this que&s;tion,
as to which I believe more than &s;ome, and le&s;s
than others. The &s;ubject appears to have now
become very unintere&s;ting to the publick.
That <HI>Fingal</HI> is not from beginning to end a
tran&s;lation from the Galick, but that <HI>&s;ome</HI> pa&s;|&s;ages
have been &s;upplied by the editor to connect
the whole, I have heard admitted by very warm
advocates for its authenticity. If this be the
ca&s;e, why are not the&s;e di&s;tinctly a&s;certained?
Antiquaries, and admirers of the work, may
complain, that they are in a &s;ituation &s;imilar to
that of the unhappy gentleman who&s;e wife in|formed
him, on her death-bed, that one of
their reputed children was not his; and, when
he eagerly begged her to declare which of them
<PB N="488" REF="494">
it was, &s;he an&s;wered, &startq;<HI>That</HI> you &s;hall never
know;&endq; and expired, leaving him in irreme|diable
doubt as to them all.</P>
<P>I beg leave now to &s;ay &s;omething upon
<HI>&s;econd &s;ight,</HI> of which I have related two in|&s;tances,
as they impre&s;&s;ed my mind at the time.
I own, I returned from the <HI>Hebrides</HI> with a con|&s;iderable
degree of faith in the many &s;tories of
that kind which I heard with a too ea&s;y ac|quie&s;cence,
without any clo&s;e examination of
the evidence: but, &s;ince that time, my belief
in tho&s;e &s;tories has been much weakened, by
reflecting on the carele&s;s inaccuracy of narra|tive
in common matters, from which we may
certainly conclude that there may be the &s;ame
in what is more extraordinary.&mdash;It is but ju&s;t,
however, to add, that the belief in &s;econd &s;ight
is not peculiar to the Highlands and i&s;les.</P>
<P>Some years after our Tour, a cau&s;e was
tried in the Court of Se&s;&s;ion, where the prin|cipal
fact to be a&s;certained was, whether a
&s;hip ma&s;ter, who u&s;ed to frequent the We&s;tern
Highlands and I&s;les, was drowned in one par|ticular
year, or in the year after. A great
number of witne&s;&s;es from tho&s;e parts were
examined on each &s;ide, and &s;wore directly
contrary to each other, upon this &s;imple que&s;|tion.
One of them, a very re&s;pectable Chief|tain,
who told me a &s;tory of &s;econd &s;ight,
which I have not mentioned, but which I too
implicitly believed, had in this ca&s;e, previous
<PB N="489" REF="495">
to his publick examination, not only &s;aid, but
atte&s;ted under his hand, that he had &s;een the
&s;hip-ma&s;ter in the year &s;ub&s;equent to that in
which the court was finally &s;atisfied he was
drowned. When interrogated with the &s;trict|ne&s;s
of judicial inquiry, and under the awe of
an oath, he recollected him&s;elf better, and re|tracted
what he had formerly a&s;&s;erted, apolo|gi&s;ing
for his inaccuracy, by telling the judges,
&startq;A man will <HI>&s;ay</HI> what he will not <HI>&s;wear.</HI>&endq;&mdash;By
many he was much cen&s;ured, and it was main|tained
that every gentleman would be as at|tentive
to truth without the &s;anction of an
oath, as with it. Dr. John&s;on, though he
him&s;elf was di&s;tingui&s;hed at all times by a
&s;crupulous adherence to truth, controverted this
propo&s;ition; and, as a proof that this was not,
though it ought to be, the ca&s;e, urged the very
different deci&s;ions of elections under Mr. Gren|ville's
Act, from tho&s;e formerly made. &startq;Gen|tlemen
will not pronounce upon oath, what they
would have &s;aid, and voted in the hou&s;e, with|out
that &s;anction.&endq;</P>
<P>However difficult it may be for men who be|lieve
in preternatural communications, in mo|dern
times, to &s;atisfy tho&s;e who are of a different
opinion, they may ea&s;ily refute the doctrine
of their opponents, who impute a belief in
<HI>&s;econd &s;ight</HI> to <HI>&s;uper&s;tition.</HI> To entertain a vi&s;io|nary
notion that one &s;ees a di&s;tant or future
event, may be called <HI>&s;uper&s;tition;</HI> but the cor|re&s;pondence
<PB N="490" REF="496">
of the fact or event with &s;uch an
impre&s;&s;ion on the fancy, though certainly very
wonderful, <HI>if proved,</HI> has no more connection
with &s;uper&s;tition, than magneti&s;m or electri|city.</P>
<P>After dinner, various topicks were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed;
but I recollect only one particular. Dr. John&s;on
compared the different talents of Garrick and
Foote, as companions, and gave Garrick
greatly the preference for elegance, though he
allowed Foote extraordinary powers of enter|tainment.
He &s;aid, &startq;Garrick is re&s;trained by
&s;ome principle; but Foote has the advantage of
an unlimited range. Garrick has &s;ome deli|cacy
of feeling; it is po&s;&s;ible to put him out;
you may get the better of him; but Foote is
the mo&s;t incompre&s;&s;ible fellow that I ever
knew: when you have driven him into a cor|ner,
and think you are &s;ure of him, he runs
through between your legs, or jumps over your
head, and makes his e&s;cape.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Er&s;kine and Mr. Robert Walker, two
very re&s;pectable mini&s;ters of Edinburgh, &s;upped
with us, as did the Reverend Dr. Web&s;ter.
&mdash;The conver&s;ation turned on the Moravian
mi&s;&s;ions, and on the Methodi&s;ts. Dr. John&s;on
ob&s;erved in general, that mi&s;&s;ionaries were too
&s;anguine in their accounts of their &s;ucce&s;s a|mong
&s;avages, and that much of what they
tell is not to be believed. He owned that the
<PB N="491" REF="497">
Methodi&s;ts had done good; had &s;pread religious
impre&s;&s;ions among the vulgar part of mankind:
but, he &s;aid, they had great bitterne&s;s again&s;t
other Chri&s;tians, and that he never could get a
Methodi&s;t to explain in what he excelled others;
that it always ended in the indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;|&s;ity
of hearing one of their preachers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Thur&s;day, <DATE>11th November.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Principal Robert&s;on came to us as we &s;at at
breakfa&s;t: he advanced to Dr. John&s;on, repeat|ing
a line of Virgil, which I forget. I &s;uppo&s;e
either
<Q><L>Po&s;t varios ca&s;us, per tot di&s;crimina rerum,&mdash;
<HI>or</HI></L>
<L>&mdash;multum ille et terris jactatus, et alto.</L></Q>
Every body had addre&s;&s;ed us with &s;ome &s;tudied
compliment on our return. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid,
&startq;I am really a&s;hamed of the congratulations
which we receive. We are addre&s;&s;ed as if we
had made a voyage to Nova Zembla, and &s;uf|fered
five per&s;ecutions in Japan.&endq; And he af|terwards
remarked, that, &startq;to &s;ee a man come
up with a formal air, and a Latin line, when
we had had no fatigue and no danger, was pro|voking.&endq;
&mdash;I told him, he was not &s;en&s;ible of
the danger, having lain under cover in the boat
during the &s;torm: he was like the chicken,
that hides its head under its wing, and then
thinks it&s;elf &s;afe.</P>
<P><PB N="492" REF="498">
Lord Elibank came to us, as did Sir Wil|liam
Forbes. The ra&s;h attempt in 1745 being
mentioned, I ob&s;erved, that it would make a
fine piece of Hi&s;tory. Dr. John&s;on &s;aid it
would. Lord Elibank doubted whether any
man of this age could give it impartially.&mdash;
<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;A man, by talking with tho&s;e of
different &s;ides, who were actors in it, and
putting down all that he hears, may in time
collect the materials of a good narrative. You
are to con&s;ider, all hi&s;tory was at fir&s;t oral. I
&s;uppo&s;e Voltaire was fifty years in collecting
his <HI>Louis XIV.</HI> which he did in the way that
I am propo&s;ing.&mdash;<HI>Robert&s;on.</HI> &startq;He did &s;o. He
lived much with all the great people who were
concerned in that reign, and heard them talk
of every thing; and then either took Mr. Bo&s;|well's
way, of writing down what he heard, or,
which is as good, pre&s;erved it in his memory;
for he has a wonderful memory.&endq;&mdash;With the
leave, however, of this elegant hi&s;torian, no
man's memory can pre&s;erve facts or &s;ayings
with &s;uch fidelity as may be done by writing
them down when they are recent.&mdash;Dr. Ro|bert&s;on
&s;aid, it was now full time to make &s;uch
a collection as Dr. John&s;on &s;ugge&s;ted; for
many of the people who were then in arms,
were dropping off; and both Whigs and Jacobites
were now come to talk with moderation.&endq;&mdash;
Lord Elibank &s;aid to him, &startq;Mr. Robert&s;on,
<PB N="493" REF="499">
the fir&s;t thing that gave me a high opinion of
you, was your &s;aying in the Select Society<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A &s;ociety for debate in Edinburgh, con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t eminent men.</NOTE>,
while parties ran high, &s;oon after the year
1745, that you did not think wor&s;e of a man's
moral character for his having been in rebel|lion.
This was venturing to utter a liberal
&s;entiment, while both &s;ides had a dete&s;tation of
each other.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved, that being in rebel|lion
from a notion of another's right, was not
connected with depravity; and that we had
this proof of it, that all mankind applauded
the pardoning of rebels; which they would not
do in the ca&s;e of robbers and murderers. He
&s;aid, with a &s;mile, that &startq;he wondered that the
phra&s;e of <HI>unnatural</HI> rebellion &s;hould be &s;o much
u&s;ed, for that all rebellion was natural to man.&endq;</P>
<P>As I kept no Journal of any thing that pa&s;&s;ed
after this morning, I &s;hall, from memory,
groupe together this and the other days, till
that on which Dr. John&s;on departed for London.
They were in all nine days; on which he dined
at Lady Colvill's, Lord Hailes's, Sir Adolphus
Oughton's, Sir Alexander Dick's, Principal
Robert&s;on's, Mr. M'Laurin's, and thrice at
Lord Elibank's &s;eat in the country, where we
al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed two nights. He &s;upped at the Ho|nourable
<PB N="494" REF="500">
Alexander Gordon's, now one of our
judges, at Mr. Nairne's, Dr. Blair's, and Mr.
Tytler's; and at my hou&s;e thrice,&mdash;one evening
with a numerous company, chiefly gentlemen
of the law; another with Mr. Menzies of Cul|dares,
and Lord Monboddo, who di&s;engaged
him&s;elf on purpo&s;e to meet him; and the even|ing
on which we returned from Lord Elibank's,
he &s;upped with my wife and me, by our&s;elves.</P>
<P>He breakfa&s;ted at Dr. Web&s;ter's, at old Mr.
Drummond's, and at Dr. Blacklock's; and
&s;pent one forenoon at my uncle Dr. Bo&s;well's,
who &s;hewed him his curious mu&s;eum; and, as
he was an elegant &s;cholar, and a phy&s;ician bred
in the &s;chool of Boerhaave, Dr. John&s;on was
plea&s;ed with his company.</P>
<P>On the mornings when he breakfa&s;ted at my
hou&s;e, he had, from ten o'clock till one or two,
a con&s;tant levee of various per&s;ons, of very dif|ferent
characters and de&s;criptions. I could not
attend him, being obliged to be in the Court of
Se&s;&s;ion; but my wife was &s;o good as to devote
the greater part of the morning to the endle&s;s
ta&s;k of pouring out tea for my friend and his
vi&s;itors.</P>
<P>Such was the di&s;po&s;ition of his time at Edin|burgh.
He &s;aid one evening to me, in a fit of
languor, &startq;Sir, we have been harra&s;&s;ed by in|vitations.&endq;
I acquie&s;ced. &startq;Ay, &s;ir, he replied;
<PB N="495" REF="501">
but how much wor&s;e would it have been, if we
had been neglected?&endq;</P>
<P>From what has been recorded in this Journal,
it may well be &s;uppo&s;ed that a variety of ad|mirable
conver&s;ation has been lo&s;t, by my
neglect to pre&s;erve it.&mdash;I &s;hall endeavour to re|collect
&s;ome of it, as well as I can.</P>
<P>At Lady Colvill's, to whom I am proud to
introduce any &s;tranger of eminence, that he
may &s;ee what dignity and grace is to be found
in Scotland, an officer ob&s;erved, that he had

lawyer.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Why, &s;ir, &s;uppo&s;ing Lord
Mansfield not to have the &s;plendid talents
which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, he mu&s;t be a great Engli&s;h
lawyer, from having been &s;o long at the bar,
and having pa&s;&s;ed through &s;o many of the
great offices of the law. Sir, you may as well
maintain that a carrier, who has driven a pack-hor&s;e
between Edinburgh and Berwick for
thirty years, does not know the road, as that
Lord Mansfield does not know the law of
England.&endq;</P>
<P>At Mr. Nairne's, he drew the character of
Richard&s;on, the authour of <HI>Glari&s;&s;a,</HI> with a &s;trong
yet delicate pencil. I lament much that I have
not pre&s;erved it: I only remember that he ex|pre&s;&s;ed
a high opinion of his talents and virtues;
but ob&s;erved, that &startq;his perpetual &s;tudy was to
ward off petty inconveniencies, and procure petty
plea&s;ures; that his love of continual &s;uperiority
<PB N="496" REF="502">
was &s;uch, that he took care to be always &s;ur|rounded
by women, who li&s;tened to him im|plicitly,
and did not venture to controvert his
opinions; and that his de&s;ire of di&s;tinction was
&s;o great, that he u&s;ed to give large vails to
the Speaker On&s;low's &s;ervants, that they might
treat him with re&s;pect.&endq;</P>
<P>On the &s;ame evening, he would not allow
that the private life of a judge, in England,
was required to be &s;o &s;trictly decorous as I
&s;uppo&s;ed. &startq;Why then, &s;ir, (&s;aid I,) according
to your account, an Engli&s;h judge may ju&s;t
live like a gentleman.&endq;&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Yes, &s;ir,&mdash;
if he <HI>can.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>At Mr. Tytler's, I happened to tell that one
evening, a great many years ago, when Dr.
Blair and I were &s;itting together in the pit of
Drury-lane play-hou&s;e, in a wild freak of youth|ful
extravagance, I entertained the audience
<HI>prodigiou&s;ly,</HI> by imitating the lowing of a cow.
A little after I had told this &s;tory, I differed
from Dr. John&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e too confidently,
upon &s;ome point, which I now forget. He did
not &s;pare me. &startq;Nay, &s;ir, (&s;aid he,) if you
cannot talk better as a man, I'd have you bel|low
like a cow<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">As I have been &s;crupulou&s;ly exact in relating anecdotes concerning other per&s;ons, I &s;hall not withhold any part of this &s;tory, however Tudicrous.&mdash;I was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in this boyi&s;h frolick, that the univer&s;al cry of the galleries was, &startq;<HI>Encore</HI> the cow$ <HI>Encore</HI> the cow$&endq; In the pride of my heart, I at|tempted imitations of &s;ome other animals, but with very inferior effect. My reverend friend, anxious for my <HI>fame,</HI> with an air of the utmo&s;t gravity and earne&s;tne&s;s, addre&s;&s;ed me thus: &startq;My dear &s;ir, I would <HI>confine</HI> my &s;elf to the <HI>cow$</HI>&endq;</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="497" REF="503">
At Dr. Web&s;ter's, he &s;aid, that he believed
hardly any man died without affectation. This
remark appears to me to be well-founded, and
will account for many of the celebrated death-bed
&s;ayings which are recorded.</P>
<P>One of the evenings at my hou&s;e, when he
told that Lord Lovat boa&s;ted to an Engli&s;h no|bleman,
that though he had not his wealth, he
had two thou&s;and men whom he could at any
time call into the field, the Honourable Alex|ander
Gordon ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e two thou&s;and
men brought him to the block.&mdash;&startq;True, &s;ir,
&s;aid Dr. John&s;on; but you may ju&s;t as well
argue, concerning a man who has fallen over a
precipice, to which he has walked too near,&mdash;
&startq;His two legs brought him to that.&endq; Is he not
the better for having two legs?&endq;</P>
<P>At Dr. Blair's I left him, in order to attend
a con&s;ultation, during which he and his amiable
ho&s;t were by them&s;elves. I returned to &s;upper,
at which were Principal Robert&s;on, Mr. Nairne,
and &s;ome other gentlemen. Dr. Robert&s;on and
Dr. Blair, I remember, talked well upon &s;ubor|dination
and government; and, as my friend
and I were walking home, he &s;aid to me, &startq;Sir,
the&s;e two doctors are good men, and wi&s;e men.&endq;
<PB N="498" REF="504">
&mdash;I begged of Dr. Blair to recollect what he
could of the long conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed be|tween
Dr. John&s;on and him alone, this evening,
and he obligingly wrote to me as follows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>&startq;Dear &s;ir,&endq;</SALUTE>
<DATE>March 3, 1785.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;&mdash;As &s;o many years have intervened,&endq;
&s;ince I chanced to have that conver&s;ation with
Dr. John&s;on in my hou&s;e, to which you refer,
I have forgotten mo&s;t of what then pa&s;&s;ed, but
remember that I was both in&s;tructed and en|tertained
by it. Among other &s;ubjects, the
di&s;cour&s;e happening to turn on modern Latin
poets, the Doctor expre&s;&s;ed a very favourable
opinion of Buchanan, and in&s;tantly repeated,
from beginning to end, an ode of his, intituled
<HI>Calendae Maiae,</HI> (the eleventh in his <HI>Mi&s;cella|neorum
Liber,)</HI> beginning with the&s;e words,
&startq;<HI>Salvete &s;acris deliciis &s;acrae,</HI>&endq; with which I had
formerly been unacquainted; but, upon pe|ru&s;ing
it, the prai&s;e which he be&s;towed upon it,
as one of the happie&s;t of Buchanan's poetical
compo&s;itions, appeared to me very ju&s;t. He
al&s;o repeated to me a Latin ode he had com|po&s;ed
in one of the We&s;tern I&s;lands, from which
he had lately returned. We had much di&s;|cour&s;e
concerning his excur&s;ion to tho&s;e i&s;lands,
with which he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as having been
highly plea&s;ed; talked in a favourable manner
of the ho&s;pitality of the inhabitants; and par|ticularly
<PB N="499" REF="505">
&s;poke much of his happine&s;s in having
you for his companion; and &s;aid, that the
longer he knew you, he loved and e&s;teemed
you the more. This conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed in the
interval between tea and &s;upper, when we were
by our&s;elves. You, and the re&s;t of the com|pany
who were with us at &s;upper, have often
taken notice that he was uncommonly bland
and gay that evening, and gave much plea&s;ure
to all who were pre&s;ent.&mdash;This is all that I can
recollect di&s;tinctly of that long conver&s;ation.</P>
<CLOSER>&startq;Yours &s;incerely,
<SIGNED>HUGH BLAIR.&endq;</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>At Lord Hailes's, we &s;pent a mo&s;t agree|able
day; but again I mu&s;t lament that I was
&s;o indolent as to let almo&s;t all that pa&s;&s;ed eva|porate
into oblivion. Dr. John&s;on ob&s;erved
there, that &startq;it was wonderful how ignorant
many officers of the army are, con&s;idering how
much lei&s;ure they have for &s;tudy, and the
acqui&s;ition of knowledge.&endq; I hope he was
mi&s;taken; for he maintained that many of
them were ignorant of things belonging im|mediately
to their own profe&s;&s;ion; &startq;for in|&s;tance,
many cannot tell how far a mu&s;ket will
carry a bullet;&endq; in proof of which, I &s;uppo&s;e,
he mentioned &s;ome particular per&s;on, for
Lord Hailes, from whom I &s;olicited what he
<PB N="500" REF="506">
could recollect of that day, writes to me as
follows:</P>
<P>&startq;As to Dr. John&s;on's ob&s;ervation about the
ignorance of officers in the length that a mu&s;ket
will carry,&endq; my brother, Colonel Dalrymple,
was pre&s;ent, and he thought that the doctor
was either mi&s;taken, by putting the que&s;tion
wrong, or that he had conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject
with &s;ome per&s;on out of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>&startq;Was it upon that occa&s;ion that he ex|pre&s;&s;ed
no curio&s;ity to &s;ee the room at Dum|fermline,
where Charles I. was born? &startq;I know
that he was born, (&s;aid he;) no matter where.&endq;
&mdash;Did he envy us the birth-place of the
king?&endq;</P>
<P>Near the end of his &startq;Journey,&endq; Dr. John|&s;on
has given liberal prai&s;e to Mr. Braidwood's
academy for the deaf and dumb. When he
vi&s;ited it, a circum&s;tance occurred which was
truly characteri&s;tical of our great Lexicographer.
&startq;Pray, (&s;aid he,) can they pronounce any <HI>long</HI>
words?&endq;&mdash;Mr. Braidwood informed him they
could. Upon which Dr. John&s;on wrote one of
his <HI>&s;equipedalia verba,</HI> which was pronounced by
the deaf and dumb, and he was &s;atisfied.&mdash;My
readers may perhaps wi&s;h to know what the
word was; but I cannot gratify their curio&s;ity.
Mr. Braidwood told me, it remained long in his
<PB N="501" REF="507">
&s;chool, but had been lo&s;t before I made my
inquiry<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">One of the be&s;t criticks of our age &startq;does not wi&s;h to prevent the admirers of the incorrect and nervele&s;s &s;tyle, which generally prevailed for a century before Dr. John&s;on's energetick writings were known, from enjoying the laugh that this &s;tory may produce, in which he is very ready to join them.&endq; He, however, reque&s;ts me to ob&s;erve, &startq;that my friend very properly cho&s;e a <HI>long</HI> word on this occa&s;ion, not, it is believed, from any predilection for poly&s;yllables, (though he certainly had a due re&s;pect for them,) but in order to put Mr. Braid|wood's &s;kill to the &s;tricte&s;t te&s;t, and to try the efficacy of his in&s;truction by the mo&s;t difficult exertion of the organs of his pupils.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on one day vi&s;ited the Court
of Se&s;&s;ion. He thought the mode of pleading
there too vehement, and too much addre&s;&s;ed to
the pa&s;&s;ions of the judges. &startq;This (&s;aid he) is
not the Areopagus.&endq;</P>
<P>At old Mr. Drummond's, Sir John Dal|rymple
quaintly &s;aid, the two noble&s;t animals
in the world were, a Scotch Highlander and an
Engli&s;h Sailor. &startq;Why, &s;ir, &s;aid Dr. John&s;on,
I &s;hall &s;ay nothing as to the Scotch Highlander;
but as to the Engli&s;h Sailor, I cannot agree
with you.&endq;&mdash;Sir John &s;aid, he was generous in
giving away his money.&mdash;<HI>John&s;on.</HI> &startq;Sir, he
throws away his money, without thought, and
without merit. I do not call a tree generous,
that &s;heds its fruit at every breeze.&endq;&mdash;Sir John
having affected to complain of the attacks
made upon his <HI>Memoirs,</HI> Dr. John&s;on &s;aid,
<PB N="502" REF="508">
&startq;Nay, &s;ir, do not complain. It is advantageous
to an authour, that his book &s;hould be attacked
as well as prai&s;ed. Fame is a &s;huttlecock. If
it be &s;truck only at one end of the room, it will
&s;oon fall to the ground. To keep it up, it
mu&s;t be &s;truck at both ends.&endq;&mdash;Often have I
reflected on this &s;ince; and, in&s;tead of being
angry at many of tho&s;e who have written
again&s;t me, have &s;miled to think that they
were unintentionally &s;ub&s;ervient to my fame,
by u&s;ing a battledoor to make me <HI>virum volitare
per ora.</HI></P>
<P>At Sir Alexander Dick's, from that ab&s;ence
of mind to which every man is at times &s;ubject,
I told, in a blundering manner, Lady Eglin|toune's
complimentary adoption of Dr. John&s;on
as her &s;on; for I unfortunately &s;tated that her
lady&s;hip adopted him as her &s;on, in con&s;equence
of her having been married the year <HI>after</HI> he
was born. Dr. John&s;on in&s;tantly corrected me.
&startq;Sir, don't you perceive that you are defaming
the counte&s;s? For, &s;uppo&s;ing me to be her &s;on,
and that &s;he was not married till the year after
my birth, I mu&s;t have been her <HI>natural</HI> &s;on.&endq;
A young lady of quality, who was pre&s;ent, very
hand&s;omely &s;aid, &startq;Might not the &s;on have ju&s;|tified
the fault?&endq;&mdash;My friend was much flat|tered
by this compliment, which he never for|got.
When in more than ordinary &s;pirits, and
talking of his journey in Scotland, he has called
to me, &startq;Bo&s;well, what was in that the young
<PB N="503" REF="509">
lady of quality &s;aid of me at Sir Alexander
Dick's?&endq; Nobody will doubt that I was happy
in repeating it.</P>
<P>My illu&s;trious friend, being now de&s;irous to
be again in the great theatre of life and ani|mated
exertion, took a place in the coach,
which was to &s;et out for London on Monday
the 22nd of November. Sir John Dalrymple
pre&s;&s;ed him to come on the Saturday before,
to his hou&s;e at Cran&s;ton, which, being twelve
miles from Edinburgh, upon the middle road
to Newca&s;tle, (Dr. John&s;on had come to
Edinburgh by Berwick, and along the naked
coa&s;t,) it would make his journey ea&s;ier, as the
coach would take him up at a more &s;ea&s;onable
hour than that at which it &s;ets out. Sior John,
I perceived, was ambitious of having &s;uch a
gue&s;t; but, as I was well a&s;&s;ured, that at this
very time he had joined with &s;ome of his
prejudiced countrymen in railing at Dr.
John&s;on, and had &s;aid, &startq;he wondered how
any gentleman of Scotland could keep com|pany
with him,&endq; I thought he did not de&s;erve
the honour: yet, as it might be a convenience to
Dr. John&s;on, I contrived that he &s;hould accept
the invitation, and engaged to conduct him.
I re&s;olved that, on our way to Sir John's, we
&s;hould make a little circuit by Ro&s;&s;in Ca&s;tle
and Hawthornden, and wi&s;hed to &s;et out &s;oon
after breakfa&s;t; but young Mr. Tytler came
to &s;hew Dr. John&s;on &s;ome e&s;&s;ays which he had
<PB N="504" REF="510">
written; and my great friend, who was ex|ceedingly
obliging when thus con&s;ulted, was
detained &s;o long that it was, I believe, one
o'clock before we got into our po&s;t-chai&s;e. I
found that we &s;hould be too late for dinner at Sir
John Dalrymple's, to which we were engaged;
but I would by no means lo&s;e the plea&s;ure of
&s;eeing my friend at Hawthornden,&mdash;of &s;eeing
<HI>Sam John&s;on</HI> at the very &s;pot where <HI>Ben Jon&s;on</HI>
vi&s;ited the learned and poetical Drummond.</P>
<P>We &s;urveyed Ro&s;$in-ca&s;tle, the romantick
&s;cene around it, and the beautiful Gothick
chapel, and dined and drank tea at the inn;
after which we proceeded to Hawthornden,
and viewed the caves; and I all the while had
<HI>Rare Ben</HI> in my mind, and was plea&s;ed to think
that this place was now vi&s;ited by another ce|lebrated
wit of England.</P>
<P>By this time &startq;the waining night was grow|ing
old,&endq; and we were yet &s;everal miles from
Sir John Dalrymple's. Dr. John&s;on did not
&s;eem much troubled at our having treated the
baronet with &s;o little attention to politene&s;s;
but when I talked of the grievous di&s;appoint|ment
it mu&s;t have been to him that we did not
come to the <HI>fea&s;t</HI> that he had prepared for us,
(for he told us he had killed a &s;even-year-old
&s;heep on purpo&s;e,) my friend got into a merry
mood, and jocularly &s;aid, &startq;I dare &s;ay, &s;ir, he
has been very &s;adly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Nay, we do not
know but the con&s;equence may have been
<PB N="505" REF="511">
faral. Let me try to de&s;cribe his &s;ituation in
his own hi&s;torical &s;tyle. I have as good a
right to make him think and talk, as he has to
tell us how people thought and talked a hun|dred
years ago, of which he has no evidence.
All hi&s;tory, &s;o far as it is not &s;upported by
contemporary evidence, is romance.&mdash;Stay now.
&mdash;Let us con&s;ider!&endq;&mdash;He then (heartily
laughing all the while) proceeded in his imita|tion,
I am &s;ure to the following effect, though
now, at the di&s;tance of almo&s;t twelve years, I
cannot pretend to recollect all the preci&s;e
words:</P>
<P>&startq;Dinner being ready, he wondered that his
gue&s;ts were not yet come. His wonder was
&s;oon &s;ucceeded by impatience. He walked
about the room in anxious agitation; &s;ome|times
he looked at his watch, &s;ometimes he
looked out at the window with an eager gaze
of expectation, and revolved in his mind the
various accidents of human life. His family
beheld him with mute conern. &startq;Surely
(&s;aid he, with a &s;igh,) they will not fail me.&endq;
&mdash;The mind of man can bear a certain pre&s;|&s;ure;
but there is a point when it can bear
no more. A rope was in his view, and he
died a Roman death<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>&startq;E&s;&s;ex was at that time confined to the &s;ame chamber of the Tower from which his father Lord Capel had been led to death, and in which his wife's grandfather had inflicted a vo|luntary death upon him&s;elf. When he &s;aw his friend carried to what he reckoned certain fate, their common enemies en|joying the &s;pectacle, and reflected that it was he who had forced Loro Howard upon the confidence of Ru&s;&s;el, he retired, and, by a <HI>Roman death,</HI> put an end to his mi&s;ery.&endq;</P>
<P>Dalrymple's Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol 1. p. 36.</P></NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="506" REF="512">
It was very late before we reached the &s;eat
of Sir John Dalrymple, who, certainly with
&s;ome rea&s;on was not in very good humour.
Our conver&s;ation was not brilliant. We
&s;upped, and went to bed in ancient rooms,
which would have better &s;uited the climate of
Italy in &s;ummer, than that of Scotland in the
month of November.</P>
<P>I recollect no conver&s;ation of the next day,
worth pre&s;erving, except one &s;aying of Dr.
John&s;on, which will be a valuable text for
many decent old dowagers, and other good
company, in various circles, to de&s;cant upon.&mdash;
He &s;aid, &startq;I am &s;orry I have not learnt to play
at cards. It is very u&s;eful in life: it generates
kindne&s;s, and con&s;olidates &s;ociety.&endq;&mdash;He cer|tainly
could not mean deep play.</P>
<P>My friend and I thought we &s;hould be more
comfortable at the inn at Black&s;hiels, tow
miles farther on. We therefore went thither
in the evening, and he was very entertaining;
but I have pre&s;erved nothing but the plea&s;ing
remembrance, and his ver&s;es on George the
Second and Cibber, and his epitaph on Parnell,
<PB N="507" REF="513">
which he was then &s;o good as to dictate to
me.</P>
<P>We breakfa&s;ted together next morning, and
then the coach came, and took him up. He
had, as one of his companions in it, as far as
Newca&s;tle, the worthy and ingenious Dr.
Hope, botanical profe&s;&s;or at Edinburgh. Both
Dr. John&s;on and he u&s;ed to &s;peak of their good
fortune in thus accidentally meeting; for they
had much in&s;tructive conver&s;ation, which is al|ways
a mo&s;t valuable enjoyment, and, when
found where it is not expected, is peculiarly
reli&s;hed.</P>
<P>I have now completed my account of our
Tour to the Hebrides. I have brought Dr.
John&s;on down to Scotland, and &s;een him into
the coach which in a few hours carried him
back into England. He &s;aid to me often,
that the time he &s;pent in this Tour was the
plea&s;ante&s;t part of his life, and a&s;ked me if I
would lo&s;e the recollection of it for five hun|dred
pounds. I an&s;wered I would not; and
he applauded my &s;etting &s;uch a value on an
acce&s;&s;ion of new images in my mind.</P>
<P>Had it not been for me, I am per&s;uaded Dr.
John&s;on never would have undertaken &s;uch a
journey; and I mu&s;t be allowed to a&s;&s;ume
&s;ome merit, from having been the cau&s;e that
our language has been enriched with &s;uch a
book as that which he publi&s;hed on his return;
a book which I never read but with the utmo&s;t
admiration, as I had &s;uch opportunities of
<PB N="508" REF="514">
knowing from what very meagre materials it
was compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But my prai&s;e may be &s;uppo&s;ed partial; and
therefore I &s;hall in&s;ert two te&s;timonies, not
liable to that objection, both written by gen|tlemen
of Scotland, to who&s;e opinions I am
confident the highe&s;t re&s;pect will be paid; Lord
Hailes, and Mr. Demp&s;ter.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Bo&s;well,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;I cannot omit a moment to return
you may be&s;t thanks for the entertainment you
have furni&s;hed me,&endq; my family, and gue&s;ts, by
the peru&s;al of Dr. John&s;on's &startq;Journey to the
We&s;tern I&s;lands;&endq;&mdash;and now for my &s;entiments
of it.&mdash;I was well entertained. His de&s;crip|tions
are accurate and vivid. He carried me
on the Tour along with him, I am plea&s;ed
with the ju&s;tice he has done to your humour and
vivacity. &startq;The noi&s;e of the wind being all
its own,&endq; is a <HI>bon-mot,</HI> that it would have
been a pity to have omitted, and a robbery not
to have a&s;cribed to its author.</P>
<P>&startq;There is nothing in the book,&endq; from be|ginning
to end, that a Scotchman need to take
ami&s;s. What he &s;ays of the country is true,
and his ob&s;ervations on the people are what
mu&s;t naturally occur to a &s;en&s;ible, ob&s;erving,
and reflecting inhabitant of a <HI>convenient</HI> Metro|polis,
where a man on thirty pounds a year
may be better accommodated with all the
little wants of life, that <HI>Col</HI> or <HI>Sir Allan.</HI> He
rea&s;on candidly about the <HI>&s;econd &s;ight;</HI> but I
wi&s;h he had enquired more before he ventured
to &s;ay he even doubted of the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch
an unu&s;ual and u&s;ele&s;s deviation from all the&endq;
<PB N="511" REF="517">
known laws of nature. The notion of the
&s;econd &s;ight I con&s;ider as a remnant of &s;uper|&s;titious
ignorance and credulity, which a phi|lo&s;opher
will &s;et down as &s;uch, till the contrary
is clearly proved, and then it will be cla&s;&s;ed
among the other certain, though unaccount|able,
parts of our nature, like dreams, and&mdash;I
do not know what.</P>
<P>&startq;In regard to the language,&endq; it has the
merit of being all his own. Many words of
foreign extraction are u&s;ed, where, I believe,
common ones would do as well, e&s;pecially on
familiar occa&s;ion. Yet I believe he could not
expre&s;s him&s;elf &s;o forcibly in any other &s;tile. I
am charmed with his re&s;earches concerning the
Er&s;e language, and the antiquity of their ma|nu&s;cripts.
I am quite convinced; and I &s;hall
rank <HI>O&s;&s;ian,</HI> and his <HI>Fingals</HI> and <HI>O&s;cars,</HI> among&s;t
the Nur&s;ery Tales, not the true hi&s;tory of our
country, in all time to come.</P>
<P>&startq;Upon the whole,&endq; the book cannot di&s;|plea&s;e,
for it has no preten&s;ion. The author
neither &s;ays he is a Geographer, nor an Anti|quarian,
nor very learned in the Hi&s;tory of
Scotland, nor a Naturali&s;t, nor a Fo&s;&s;ili&s;t. The
manners of the people, and the face of the
country, are all he attempts to de&s;cribes, or &s;eems
to have thought of. Much were it to be
wi&s;hed, that they who have travelled into more
remote, and of cour&s;e more curious, regions,
<PB N="512" REF="518">
had all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his good &s;en&s;e. Of the &s;tate
of learning, his ob&s;ervations on Gla&s;gow uni|ver&s;ity
&s;hew he has formed a very found judge|ment.
He under&s;tands our climate too, and
he has accurately ob&s;erved the changes, how|ever
&s;low and imperceptible to us, which
Scotland has undergone, in con&s;equence of the
ble&s;&s;ings of liberty and internal peace. I
could have drawn my pen through the &s;tory of
the old woman at St. Andrews, being the only
&s;illy thing in the book. He has taken the
opportunity of engrafting into the work &s;everal
good ob&s;ervations, which I dare &s;ay he had
made upon men and things, before he &s;et foot
on Scotch ground, by which it is con&s;iderably
enriched<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Orme, one of the able&s;t hi&s;torians of this age, is of the &s;ame opinion. He &s;aid to me, &startq;There are in that book thoughts, which, by long revolution in the great mind of John&s;on, have been formed and poli&s;hed,&mdash;like pebble$ rolled in the ocean!</NOTE>&endq;. A long journey, like a tall May-pole,
though not very beautiful it&s;elf, yet is
pretty enough, when ornamented with flowers
and garlands: it furni&s;hes a &s;ort of cloak-pins
for hanging the furniture of your mind upon&punc;
and whoever &s;ets out upon a journey, without
furni&s;hing his mind previou&s;ly with much &s;tudy
and u&s;eful knowledge, erects a May-pole in
December, and puts up very u&s;ele&s;s cloak-pins.</P>
<P><PB N="513" REF="519">
&startq;I hope the book will induce many of his
countrymen to make the &s;ame jaunt,&endq; and help
to intermix the more liberal part of them &s;till
more with us, and perhaps abate &s;omewhat of
that virulent antipathy which many of them
entertain again&s;t the Scotch; who certainly
would never have formed tho&s;e <HI>combinations</HI>
which he takes notice of, more than their an|ce&s;tors,
had they not been nece&s;&s;ary for their
mutual &s;afety, at lea&s;t for their &s;ucce&s;s, in a
country where they are treated as foreigners.
They would find us not deficient, at lea&s;t in
point of ho&s;pitality, and they would be a&s;hamed
ever after to abu&s;e us in the ma&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;So much for the Tour.&mdash;I have now,&endq; for
the fir&s;t time in my life, pa&s;&s;ed a winter in the
country; and never did three months roll on
with more &s;wiftne&s;s and &s;atisfaction. I u&s;ed
not only to wonder at, but pity, tho&s;e who&s;e lot
condemned them to winter any where but in
either of the capitals. But every place has its
charms to a cheerful mind. I am bu&s;y, planting
and taking mea&s;ures for opening the &s;ummer-campaign
in farming; and I find I have an
excellent re&s;ource, when revolutions in poli|ticks
perhaps, and revolutions of the &s;un for
certain, will make it decent for me to retreat
behind the ranks of the more forward in life.</P>
<P>&startq;I am glad to hear the la&s;t was a very bu&s;y

<P>&startq;I take this occa&s;ion of returning you
my mo&s;t hearty thanks for the civilities &s;hown
to my daughter by you and Mrs. Bo&s;well.&endq; Yet,
though &s;he has informed me that I am under
this obligation, I would very probably have
deferred troubling you with making my ac|knowledgements
at pre&s;ent, if I had not &s;een
Doctor John&s;on's Journey to the We&s;tern I&s;les,
in which he has been plea&s;ed to make a very
friendly mention of my family, for which I am
&s;urely obliged to him, as being more than an
equivalent for the reception you and he met
with. Yet there is one paragraph I &s;hould
have been glad he had omitted, which I am &s;ure
was owing to mi&s;information; that is, that I
had acknowledged M'Leod to be my chief,
though my ance&s;tors di&s;puted the pre-eminence
for a long tract of time.</P>
<P>&startq;I never had occa&s;ion to enter &s;eriou&s;ly on this
argument with the pre&s;ent laird or his grand|father,&endq;
nor could I have any temptation to &s;uch
a renunciation from either of them. I acknow|ledge
the benefit of being chief of a clan is in
our days of very little &s;ignificancy, and to
<PB N="516" REF="522">
trace out the progre&s;s of this honour to the
founder of a family, of any &s;tanding, would per|haps
be a matter of &s;ome difficulty.</P>
<P>&startq;The true &s;tate of the pre&s;ent ca&s;e in this:&endq;
the M'Leod family con&s;i&s;ts of two different
branches; the M'Leods of Lewis, of which I
am de&s;cended, and the M'Leods of Harris.
And though the former have lo&s;t a very exten|&s;ive
e&s;tate by forfeiture in King James the &s;ixth's
time, there are &s;till &s;everal re&s;pectable families
of it exi&s;ting, who would ju&s;tly blame me for
&s;uch an unmeaning ce&s;&s;ion, when they all ac|knowledge
me head of that family; which
though in fact it be but an ideal point of ho|nour,
is not hitherto &s;o far di&s;regarded in our
country, but it would determine &s;ome of my
friends to look on me as a much &s;maller man
than either they or my&s;elf judge me at pre&s;ent
to be. I will, therefore, a&s;k it as a favour of
you to acquaint the Doctor with the difficulty
he has brought me to. In travelling among
rival clans &s;uch a &s;illy tale as this might ea&s;ily
be whi&s;pered into the ear of pa&s;&s;ing &s;tranger;
but as it has no foundation in fact, I hope the
Doctor will be &s;o good as to take his own way
in undeceiving the publick, I principally mean
my friends and connections, who will be fir&s;t
angry at me, and next &s;orry to find &s;uch an in|&s;tance
of my littlene&s;s recorded in a book which
has a very fair chance of being much read. I
<PB N="517" REF="523">
expect you will let me know what he will write
you in return, and we here beg to make offer
to you and Mrs. Bo&s;well of our mo&s;t re&s;pectful

<P>&startq;THE day before ye&s;terday I had
the honour to receive your letter,&endq; and I im|mediately
communicated it to Dr. John&s;on.
He &s;aid he loved your &s;pirit, and was exceed|ingly
&s;orry that he had been the cau&s;e of the
&s;malle&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s to you. There is not a more
candid man in the world than he is, when pro|perly
addre&s;&s;ed, as you will &s;ee from his letter
to you, which I now enclo&s;e. He has allowed
me to take a copy of it, and he &s;ays you may
read it to your clan, or publi&s;h it if you plea&s;e.
Be a&s;&s;ured, &s;ir, that I &s;hall take care of what
he has entru&s;ted to me, which is to have an ac|knowledgement
of his errour in&s;erted in the
Edinburgh new&s;papers. You will, I dare &s;ay,
be fully &s;atisfied with Dr. John&s;on's behaviour.
He is de&s;irous to know that you are; and
therefore when you have read his acknowledge|ment
in the papers, I beg you may write to
<PB N="518" REF="524">
me; and if you choo&s;e it, I am per&s;uaded a
letter from you to the Doctor al&s;o will be taken
kind. I &s;hall be at Edinburgh the week after
next.</P>
<P>&startq;Any civilities which my wife and I had it in
our power to &s;hew to your daughter, Mi&s;s
M'Leod, were due to her own merit, and were
well repaid by her agreeable company. But
I am &s;ure I &s;hould be a very unworthy man if I
did not wi&s;h to &s;hew a grateful &s;en&s;e of the
ho&s;pitable and genteel manner in which you
was plea&s;ed to treat me. Be a&s;&s;ured, my dear
&s;ir, that I &s;hall never forget your goodne&s;s,
and the happy hours which I &s;pent in Ra&s;ay.</P>
<P>&startq;You and Dr. M'Leod were both &s;o obliging
as to promi&s;e me an account in writing,&endq; of all
the particulars which each of you remember,
concerning the tran&s;actions of 1745-6. Pray
do not forget this, and be as minute and as full
as you can; put down every thing; I have a
great curio&s;ity to know as much as I can, au|thentically.</P>
<P>&startq;I beg that you may pre&s;ent my be&s;t re&s;pects
to Lady Ra&s;ay,&endq; my compliments to your young
family, and to Dr. M'Leod; and my hearty

<P>They who&s;e inferiour exertions are recorded,
as &s;erving to explain or illu&s;trate the &s;ayings of
&s;uch men, may be proud of being thus a&s;&s;o|ciated,
and having their names carried down to
po&s;terity, by being appended to an illu&s;trious
character.</P>
<P>Before I quit this &s;ubject, I think it proper to
&s;ay, that I have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed every thing that I
thought could really hurt any one now living.
With re&s;pect to what <HI>is</HI> related, I thought it
my duty to &startq;extenuate nothing, nor &s;et down
aught in malice,&endq; and with tho&s;e lighter &s;trokes
of Dr. John&s;on's &s;atire, proceeding from a
warmth and quickne&s;s of imagination, not from
<PB N="524" REF="530">
any malevolence of heart, and which, on account
of their excellence, could not be omitted, I tru&s;t
that they who are the object of them have
good &s;en&s;e and good temper enough not to be
di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that I &s;hall ever reflect
with great plea&s;ure on a Tour which has been
the means of pre&s;erving &s;o much of the enlight|ened
and in&s;tructive conver&s;ation of one who&s;e
virtues will, I hope, ever be an object of imi|tation,
and who&s;e powers of mind were &s;o ex|traordinary,
that ages may revolve before &s;uch
a man &s;hall again appear.</P>

<HEAD>Preparing for the Pre&s;s, in one Volume Quarto,
THE LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL. D.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JAMES BOSWELL, ESQ.</BYLINE>
<P>MR. Bo&s;well has been collecting materials for this
work for more than twenty years, during which he
was honoured with the intimate friend&s;hip of Dr. John&s;on;
to who&s;e memory he is ambitious to erect a literary monu|ment,
worthy of &s;o great an authour, and &s;o excellent a
man. Dr. John&s;on was well informed of his de&s;ign, and
obligingly communicated to him &s;everal curious particu|lars.
With the&s;e will be interwoven the mo&s;t authentick
accounts that can be obtained from tho&s;e who knew him
be&s;t; many &s;ketches of his conver&s;ation on a multiplicity
of &s;ubjects, with various per&s;ons, &s;ome of them the mo&s;t
eminent of the age; a great number of letters from him at
different periods, and &s;everal original pieces dictated by
him to Mr. Bo&s;well, di&s;tingui&s;hed by that peculiar energy,
which marked every emanation of his mind.</P>
