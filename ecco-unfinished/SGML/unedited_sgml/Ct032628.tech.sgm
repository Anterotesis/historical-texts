<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>NO &s;cience affords more opportunity
for exerting the rea&s;oning faculty,
than that of law; and yet, in no other
&s;cience is authority &s;o prevalent. What
are our law-books but a ma&s;s of naked
propo&s;itions, drawn chiefly from the de|ci&s;ions
of our &s;upreme courts, rarely con|nected
either with premi&s;es or con&s;equen|ces?
Our &s;upreme civil court con&s;i&s;ts of
many members: can uniformity be ex|pected
from a fluctuating body, as if all
men were actuated with the &s;ame &s;pirit?
Yet in none of our law-books is there the
&s;lighte&s;t attempt to &s;eparate the chaff from
the wheat. Lord Stair, our capital writer
on law, was an eminent philo&s;opher; but
as he was not educated to the profe&s;&s;ion
of law, his In&s;titutes con&s;i&s;t chiefly of
deci&s;ions of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion; which
with him are all of equal authority,
though not always concordant: nor are
the works of our later writers much more
&s;y&s;tematic. Such a mode of writing is
infectious: Our law-&s;tudents, trained to
rely upon authority, &s;eldom think of que|&s;tioning
<PB N="viii" REF="5">
what they read: they hu&s;band
their rea&s;oning faculty, as if it would
ru&s;t by exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor is the exerci&s;e of rea&s;oning promo|ted
in any degree by public profe&s;&s;ors.
Our law is grafted on that of old Rome;
which accordingly is properly made the
fir&s;t &s;tage in law-education. The Roman
law is illu&s;trious for its equitable rules,
affording great &s;cope for acute rea&s;on|ing;
and yet that law is not taught by
any profe&s;&s;or, foreign or dome&s;tic, with
any view to improve the rea&s;oning facul|ty.
Its rules of equity ought to be &s;e|dulou&s;ly
illu&s;trated, as the corner-&s;tone of
law. In&s;tead of which, nothing is pre|&s;ented
to the young gentlemen but naked
facts. Nor are even tho&s;e facts &s;elected
that are more immediately connected with
modern law: all are &s;tated indi&s;crimi|nately.
What u&s;e, for example, to our
&s;tudents, is the chapter, <HI>De lege fu&s;ia ca|nidia
tollenda,</HI> for the chapter, <HI>De excu&s;a|tionibus
tutorum et curatorum,</HI> for the intri|cate
rules of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, for the &s;till more
intricate rules that concern pactions, or
for a thou&s;and other particulars that have
<PB N="ix" REF="6">
no relation to any modern law, none at
lea&s;t to the law of Scotland. They load
the weak mind with a heap of unintere&s;t|ing
facts, without giving any exerci&s;e to
the judgement. Is it &s;urpri&s;ing, that the
Roman law, &s;o taught, is held to be a
dry and fatiguing &s;tudy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I &s;hould merit cen&s;ure equal to what I do liberally be&s;tow on others, did I did not except Mr John Millar, Profe&s;&s;or of Roman law in the college of Gla&s;gow.</NOTE>? Is there no
cau&s;e to fear, that many of our law-&s;tu|dents,
contracting an aver&s;ion to &s;tudy in
general, will &s;ink into idlene&s;s, and prove
no le&s;s u&s;ele&s;s to them&s;elves than to their
country? Are there no traces to be di&s;|covered
of this malady? Many, many.</P>
<P>A Scotch profe&s;&s;or of Roman law ought
to be well acquainted with the law of his
own country, &s;o as in every lecture to
point where our law differs from that of
old Rome. A cour&s;e of &s;uch lectures,
carried on with &s;pirit and di&s;cernment,
would draw great attention: The &s;tudent
who&s;e immediate object was the Roman
law, would be &s;urpri&s;ed to find the ad|vance
he had made in that of his own
<PB N="x" REF="7">
country: how much more ea&s;y, and even
plea&s;ant, would his future progre&s;s be?
In&s;tead of &s;uch lectures, he is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
by his profe&s;&s;or without a &s;ingle idea, but
what is &s;trictly Roman; and &s;uch ideas
are ignorantly applied by him to the law
of his own country, as chance or conceit
directs. Lamentable mu&s;t this education
be, when it can be traced in the writings
even of our mo&s;t celebrated authors. Will
I be forgiven to draw out of my budget
one in&s;tance? Sir George Mackenzie, in
his In&s;titutions of the law of Scotland,
follows literally the Roman divi&s;ion of
contracts, into verbal, real, con&s;en&s;ual,
and &s;criptural. Would one require better
authority? And yet there is not the &s;light|e&s;t
foundation in our law for &s;uch a divi|&s;ion.</P>
<P>In other &s;ciences rea&s;on begins to make
a figure: Why &s;hould it be excluded
from the &s;cience of law? The authority
of men of eminence has de&s;ervedly great
weight; for nature gives it weight. But
authority ought to be &s;ub&s;ervient to rea|&s;on;
which the God of nature has be|&s;towed
on man, as his chief guide in
<PB N="xi" REF="8">
thinking as well as in acting. The great
Des Cartes commenced his philo&s;ophical
inquiries with doubting of every thing: he
endeavoured not to believe even his own
exi&s;tence, without an argument. This
indeed was carrying &s;ceptici&s;m to an ex|travagance:
it was however erring on the
&s;afer &s;ide; for exce&s;s in &s;ceptici&s;m is le&s;s
unmanly, than exce&s;s in deforence to au|thority:
rea&s;on may profit by the former;
it is &s;tifled by the latter. I have ventu|red
to carry the &s;ceptical &s;pirit into the
pre&s;ent work, wi&s;hing, hoping, to roufe
that &s;pirit in others. I have perhaps in|dulged
it too much. But by whom will
my erroneous opinions be confuted? Not
by blind followers, but by acute rea&s;on|ers:
and &s;uch will be indebted to me e|ven
for my errors; as exerci&s;e is the &s;ove|reign
means for advancing the rea&s;oning
faculty to maturity. We &s;ubmit impli|citly
to a work in which there is nothing
to be corrected; and &s;ink imperceptibly in|to
indolence and inattention. But the de|tection
of one error, makes the reader
hunt for more; and the game is pur&s;ued
with vigour. In that view, I would not
prefer even Ari&s;totle before the author of
<PB N="xii" REF="9">
<HI>L'E&s;prit des Loix.</HI> That celebrated writer
abounds with ob&s;ervations, no le&s;s plea|&s;ing
than &s;olid. But a &s;prightly genius,
prone to novelty and refinement, has be|trayed
him into manifold errors; and the
reader is never &s;uffered to fall a&s;leep.</P>
<P>The rea&s;onings of Roman lawyers are
always elegant, and generally correct.
Their arguments however &s;eldom reach to
fir&s;t principles. The&s;e were little thought
of &s;o early, even in the &s;chools of philo|&s;ophy;
nor is it yet common to trace an
argument &s;o far back. In the pre&s;ent e&s;|&s;ays,
there are &s;ome &s;light attempts to
reach fir&s;t principles: who knows whe|ther
this &s;mall &s;eed may not produce plen|ty
of fruit! I expect not approbation in
my own time; no not if my life were to
be prolonged half a century. In law, as
in religion, the &s;tudent acquires from his
preceptors a number of practical rules;
and in youth the&s;e rules make an impre&s;|&s;ion
&s;o deep, as never to be eradicated. If
this work make any impre&s;&s;ion, it mu&s;t
be on the <HI>tabula ra&s;a</HI> of a new generation:
upon them I tru&s;t it will make an impre&s;|&s;ion;
and that pro&s;pect is my reward. I
<PB N="xiii" REF="10">
wi&s;h to be u&s;eful: &s;ucce&s;s depends not on
me.</P>
<P>Were law taught as a rational &s;cience,
its principles unfolded, and its connection
with manners and politics, it would prove
an enticing &s;tudy to every per&s;on who has
an appetite for knowledge. We might
hope to &s;ee our lawyers &s;oaring above their
predece&s;&s;ors; and giving &s;plendor to their
country, by purifying and improving its
laws.</P>
<P>As my intention is only to give ex|amples
of rea&s;oning, free from the &s;hackles
of authority, I pretend not to &s;ay what
our law actually is, but what it ought to
be.</P>

<HEAD>ELUCIDATIONS
RESPECTING
The COMMON and STATUTE
LAW of SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Voluntary obligation by a minor without
con&s;ent of curators, and by a married
woman.</HEAD>
<P>A Minor's bond without con&s;ent of his
curators, is held to be void by writers
on the Roman law; and al&s;o by our
writers, who follow implicitly their
ma&s;ters. I cannot &s;ubmit to this doctrine. By
the common law of the Romans, no difference
was made between a major and a minor; and
curators were given by the Pretor to a minor,
in order to protect him from being hurt by his
imbecility. A minor's bond therefore mu&s;t in
Rome have been effectual at common law, no
<PB N="2" REF="15">
le&s;s than a bond granted by a major; and the
pretor had no power to annul &s;uch a bond, in
contradiction to common law. His power reach|ed
no farther, than to &s;upply defects in common
law, and to correct any wrong that might happen
by a too rigid application of it<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">l. 3. &sect; 1. De ju&s;ticia et jure.</NOTE>. Thus, where
a minor was &s;ued for payment of a bond granted
by him to his hurt without con&s;ent of his cura|tors,
it was incumbent on the pretor to &s;u&s;tain
action; but then he rendered the bond ineffec|tual,
by &s;u&s;taining an exception in equity. And
by the &s;ame equitable power, he afforded a <HI>re&s;ti|tutio
in integrum,</HI> where there was no proce&s;s
to give opportunity for proponing an exception<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See l. 101. verb. oblig.; l. 43. oblig. act.; Heineccius, tit. Minor, &sect; 495.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A minor's bond in Scotland, though granted
without con&s;ent of curators, cannot be null <HI>ip&s;o
jure;</HI> for it may happen to be highly beneficial to
him. If challengeable, it requires in &s;trict form
to be taken out of the way by reduction. But as,
in this country, a ground of reduction in&s;tantly
verified, is admitted in the form of an exception,
to &s;ave expence and delay; a minor who grants
a bond without con&s;ent of curators, is pre&s;umed
to be hurt by it; and the pre&s;umption is admitted
by way of exception, becau&s;e it requires no
proof. This form has led our writers inadvert|ently
<PB N="3" REF="16">
to &s;ay, that a bond granted by a minor
without con&s;ent of ourators, is void and null.
And yet, &s;uch a bond is every day &s;u&s;tained a|gain&s;t
a reduction, upon evidence given that it
is not hurtful to the minor. Now a deed that is
void and null, cannot be &s;upported by any evi|dence.
Further, though the objection of hurt or
le&s;ion will be admitted in a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of &s;uch a
bond; yet if evidence be brought of a valuable
con&s;ideration, the bond will be &s;u&s;tained, and the
letters be found orderly proceeded<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See 22d June 1627, Drummond; 11th December 1629, Gordon; 5th February 1631, Inglis. All collect|ed by Dury.</NOTE>. I add,
that &s;uch a bond, if not challenged within forty
years, will &s;tand good again&s;t all objections;
though it is clear, that a bond originally null,
cannot become effectual by any length of time.
The&s;e con&s;iderations make it evident, that a mi|nor's
bond without con&s;ent of curators, is not
void, but voidable only.</P>
<P>In Ju&s;tinian's Novel 134. cap. 8. an obligation
by a woman for behoof of her hu&s;band, is pro|hibited.
We have taken the hint, and have ex|tended
it. &startq;By our cu&s;tom,&endq; &s;ays Lord Stair,
a wife's obligation for debt, or per&s;onal obli|gation,
contracted during the marriage, is
null<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In&s;titutions, book 1. tit. 4. &sect; 16.</NOTE>.&endq; That &s;uch a bond is voidable, is un|que&s;tionable;
<PB N="4" REF="17">
but I cannot admit it to be void,
more than a bond by a minor without con&s;ent of
curators. A bond by a married woman produces
undoubtedly an obligation by the law of nature,
or a natural obligation, as termed by Roman
writers; and I find no &s;tatute, nor rule at com|mon
law, prohibiting &s;uch a bond, or declaring
it void when granted. The law of Scotland, it is
true, in order to protect a wife from being hurt
by her commercial dealings, affords her an ex|ception
again&s;t &s;uch a bond, which &s;he may u&s;e
when &s;he thinks her&s;elf over-reached. The ex|ception
protects her from payment; but if &s;he
do not u&s;e it, the bond is effectual in law. And
that this is the doctrine of our law, will appear
from the following con&s;iderations. Fir&s;t, it is not
<HI>pars judicis</HI> to refu&s;e action upon &s;uch a bond;
the judge mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain action, and pronounce &s;en|tence,
if the exception be not &s;tated. Second, if
a married woman become cautioner in a bond for
borrowed money, and obtain a &s;ecurity for her
relief, &s;he may unque&s;tionably operate her relief
by that &s;ecurity; and yet, if the cautionary oblige|ment
were void in law, the &s;ecurity could not
&s;ub&s;i&s;t. Thus a man having granted an a&s;&s;ign|ment
to his wife for relieving her of a debt in
which &s;he was cautioner for him, it was decreed,
that the wife might &s;ubmit to the cautionary ob|ligement,
and in&s;i&s;t on the a&s;&s;ignment for her re|lief
<PB N="5" REF="18">
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Stair, 18th July 1672, Wat&s;on <HI>contra</HI> Bruce.</NOTE>. Third, if a wife have a fund appointed
for her aliment exclu&s;ive of the <HI>jus mariti,</HI> her
bond for furni&s;hing will be &s;u&s;tained<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, 23d February 1672, Neil&s;on <HI>contra</HI> Arthur.</NOTE>. And in
general, a bond by a married woman for a valu|able
con&s;ideration, will in every ca&s;e be &s;u&s;tained.
If &s;o, the ju&s;t notion of &s;uch a bond &s;eems to be
what follows. A woman under coverture &s;eldom
has occa&s;ion to deal in money-matters. The hu&s;|band
is the admini&s;trator of her effects, and is
bound to provide her with all nece&s;&s;aries. There|fore
where &s;he grants a bond of borrowed mo|ney,
her &s;ituation affords a pre&s;umption of impo|&s;ition;
which &s;he may &s;tate by way of exception,
becau&s;e it requires no proof. But if the excep|tion
be removed, by giving evidence of a valuable
con&s;ideration, the bond will be effectual. In that
view, the ca&s;e of a wife re&s;embles that of a mi|nor,
or of a per&s;on interdicted. The only dif|ference
is, that a bond granted by a minor, or
by an interdicted per&s;on, is good in law if the cu|rators
or interdictors con&s;ent; which removes the
pre&s;umption of impo&s;ition. But a bond granted
by a married woman, is exceptionable though
the hu&s;band con&s;ent; becau&s;e his con&s;ent removes
not the pre&s;umption of impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Here it may be ob&s;erved, that when a ground
of reduction is cut off by the negative pre&s;crip|tion,
<PB N="6" REF="19">
it cannot be urged by way of exception,
more than in a regular proce&s;s of reduction. As
it is admitted in the form of an exception, mere|ly
to &s;ave the expence and delay of a reduction;
if it be not competent by reduction, as little
ought it to be competent by exception. Hence
the rule in the Roman law, <HI>Temporanea ad a|gendum
&s;unt perpetua ad excipiendum,</HI> obtains
not with us.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">What obligations are effectually conveyed
by a&s;&s;ignment.</HEAD>
<P>A Debtor cannot relieve him&s;elf from his ob|ligation
by &s;ub&s;tituting another in his
place, unle&s;s the creditor con&s;ent. As little can
the creditor &s;ub&s;titute another in his place, where
the obligation is to pay to him and not to any o|ther
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Stair, tit. A&s;&s;ignation, &s;ect. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In order to make obligations more u&s;eful, an
indirect method of tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion was invented,
which is a procuratory <HI>in rem &s;uam</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sect. 3. eod.</NOTE>. But a
procuratory <HI>in rem &s;uam</HI> is, from its nature, con|fined
to money-obligations, extingui&s;hable by
payment. If I give a mandate to receive from
my debtor the money he owes me, he can have
no ju&s;t objection again&s;t paying to the mandata|ry;
becau&s;e &s;uch payment di&s;&s;olves the obliga|tion;
and the mandatary, by my con&s;ent, may
retain the money as payment of what I owe him.
An obligation <HI>ad factum prae&s;tandum</HI> is very dif|ferent.
It is the &s;ame to me, whether I pay mo|ney
to my creditor or to his mandatary; but it
<PB N="8" REF="21">
is not the &s;ame to me, whether I perform per&s;o|nal
&s;ervice to my &s;uperior or to his mandatary.
If I have obliged my&s;elf to lend my hor&s;e to John,
there is a <HI>delectus per&s;onae,</HI> and I am not bound
to lend it to any other. An obligation to di&s;pone
land to James, will not bind me to di&s;pone it to
John. I purcha&s;e land under rever&s;ion to the
vender, he cannot oblige me to redi&s;pone it to a|ny
other. I accept Alexander for my tenant,
and grant a lea&s;e to him: he has no power to in|troduce
another into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my land in|&s;tead
of him&s;elf. Hence the maxim, That tacks
and rever&s;ions are <HI>&s;tricti juris;</HI> and that a&s;&s;ig|nees
are excluded, unle&s;s named in the deed.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to tacks in particular, this propo|&s;ition
appears &s;o clear, as to occa&s;ion &s;ome degree
of wonder what could influence the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion
to make an exception with re&s;pect to liferent|tacks.
Lord Stair<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In&s;titutions, book 2. tit. 9. &s;ect. 26.</NOTE>, on the authority of Craig,
and one or two deci&s;ions, lays it down, that life|rent-tacks
may be a&s;&s;igned, though not mention|ing
a&s;&s;ignees. His Lord&s;hip would have been
puzzled for an an&s;wer to this plain que&s;tion, What
intitles a tack&s;man to give any one a &s;ettlement
on land that is not his property? And the &s;ame
objection lies with re&s;pect to a tack for nineteen
years. A tack is a mere per&s;onal right: it was
not made real by the act 18. parl. 1449, which
<PB N="9" REF="22">
only declares, &startq;That, for the &s;afety and encou|ragement
of poor people who labour the
ground, their tacks &s;hall be &s;ecure again&s;t a
purcha&s;er of the land.&endq; By what means &s;e|cure?
Not by converting a tack into a real
right, contrary to its nature, and without nece&s;&s;i|ty;
but by a &s;tatutory prohibition, preci&s;ely as an
entail is &s;ecure again&s;t the deeds of the proprie|tor.
Now, if a tack be only a per&s;onal right,
what intitles the tack&s;man to put any other in his
place? and what is it that binds the proprietor,
to admit any per&s;on to po&s;&s;e&s;s his land without his
con&s;ent? This argument, founded on the nature
of property, appears to me invincible. In &s;hort,
I can di&s;cover no cau&s;e that impowers a tack&s;man,
more than a rever&s;er, to &s;ub&s;titute another in his
place.</P>
<P>A procuratory <HI>in rem &s;uam</HI> is but a precarious
right; for it bars not the cedent from receiving
payment. To give a bond for borrowed money
a more &s;ecure currency, a clau&s;e has been invent|ed,
taking the debtor bound to pay the &s;um to
any per&s;on who &s;hall be authori&s;ed by the creditor
to receive payment; which is commonly expre&s;&s;ed
in the following terms, obliging the borrower to
pay to the lender, or to his a&s;&s;ignee. And thus,
with the con&s;ent of the debtor him&s;elf, the a&s;&s;ig|nee
is intitled to &s;ue for payment. Thus, an a&s;|&s;ignment
of &s;uch a bond intimated to the debtor,
makes a complete tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>jus crediti,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="23">
dive&s;ting the cedent <HI>funditus;</HI> which is a &s;ub|&s;tantial
improvement in the commerce of money-obligations.
The clau&s;e mentioned was too u&s;e|ful
to be confined to money-obligations. It has
been extended to obligations <HI>ad facta prae&s;tan|da;</HI>
and hence a power to a&s;&s;ign is frequently ad|hibited
to tacks and rever&s;ions.</P>
<P>Every exception again&s;t the cedent is effectual
again&s;t his procurator; but where an a&s;&s;ignment
is con&s;ented to, none but real exceptions, &s;uch as
ari&s;e from the nature of the right, ought to be ef|fectual
again&s;t the a&s;&s;ignee.</P>
<P>There are however a&s;&s;ignments that denude
not the cedent. An a&s;&s;ignment to rents of land,
will bar the cedent from levying the rents; but it
will not bar the cedent from conveying the land
it&s;elf, nor the purcha&s;er from levying the rents
<HI>qua</HI> proprietor of the land. There can be no in|defea&s;ible
right to rents, otherwi&s;e than by di&s;po|ning
the property of the land, or by creating a
real right upon it.</P>

<HEAD>ART. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A challenge again&s;t the author, in what
ca&s;es &s;u&s;tained again&s;t the per&s;on who
acquires from him.</HEAD>
<P>A Challenge founded on a defect of right in
the author, is e&s;&s;entially different from a
challenge founded on per&s;onal circum&s;tances.
The former is made effectual by a declarator of
nullity: the latter, by a reduction. A declara|tor
of nullity concludes, that the author had no
power to convey the &s;ubject; and therefore that
the purcha&s;er has no right: a reduction admits
that the &s;ubject was conveyed; but concludes, that
the purcha&s;er did wrong in making the purcha&s;e,
and therefore that he ought to be deprived of
the &s;ubject. A declarator of nullity is according|ly
a real action; and it is the nature of a real ac|tion
to be effectual again&s;t every &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;|&s;or:
a reduction is a per&s;onal action, which can
only be effectual again&s;t the per&s;on guilty. The
following examples will illu&s;trate the di&s;tinction.
Property is transferred by con&s;ent with delivery:
force or fear may produce external expre&s;&s;ions of
con&s;ent; but the internal act, which is the capi|tal
part, will not be pre&s;umed, unle&s;s where a
man is at liberty to act according to his own will.
<PB N="12" REF="25">
Therefore, as there is no con&s;ent in the ca&s;e of
force or fear, the property of the &s;ubject is not
transferred, though delivery be made; and the
purcha&s;er, though not acce&s;&s;ory to the wrong, is
deprived of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by a declarator of nul|lity,
which is in effect the &s;ame with the <HI>rei vin|dicatio</HI>
in the Roman law. Let us &s;uppo&s;e now
a &s;ubject to have been acquired by fraud. Fraud
is no ob&s;truction to con&s;ent, more than error is:
on the contrary, it &s;hews in what manner the di&s;|poner
was deluded to con&s;ent, and to convey.
Fraud then ob&s;tructs not the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of pro|perty;
and has no effect but to found a reduction
again&s;t the purcha&s;er, concluding, that he ought
not to hold a &s;ubject which he fraudulently acqui|red.</P>
<P>From the&s;e premi&s;es it is evident, that a decla|rator
of nullity is effectual again&s;t every acquirer,
not excepting a purcha&s;er for a valuable con&s;ide|ration:
the objection lies, that he purcha&s;ed <HI>a non
habente pote&s;tatem.</HI> A reduction is very differ|ent:
it is founded on per&s;onal circum&s;tances, and
therefore cannot be effectual again&s;t a <HI>bona fide</HI>
purcha&s;er for a valuable con&s;ideration. To illu|&s;trate
the latter propo&s;ition, I &s;hall give a few ex|amples.</P>
<P>I begin with a reduction on the head of fraud;
as to which hear Lord Stair<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Book. 4. tit. 40. &s;ect. 21.</NOTE>. &startq;Fraud being
<PB N="13" REF="26">
of a criminal nature, is not relevant again&s;t &s;in|gular
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors, not partakers of the fraud,
but only again&s;t the committers of the fraud,
and tho&s;e repre&s;enting them, e&s;pecially as to
feudal rights. The rea&s;on whereof is, to &s;e|cure
land-rights, and that purcha&s;ers be not
di&s;appointed. But in per&s;onal rights the fraud
of authors is relevant again&s;t &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors,
though not partakers nor con&s;cious of the
fraud when they purcha&s;ed: becau&s;e a&s;&s;ignees
are but procurators, albeit <HI>in rem &s;uam;</HI> and
therefore are in the &s;ame ca&s;e with their ce|dents.
Yet in moveables, purcha&s;ers are not
quarrelable upon the fraud of their authors, if
they did purcha&s;e for an onerous equivalent
cau&s;e. The rea&s;on is, that moveables mu&s;t
have a current cour&s;e of traffic; and the buyer
is not to con&s;ider how the &s;eller purcha&s;ed, un|le&s;s
it were by theft or violence, which the law
accounts a <HI>labes realis</HI> following the &s;ubject
to all &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; otherwi&s;e there would be the
greate&s;t encouragement to theft and robbery.&endq;
The rea&s;on here given why the purcha&s;er of
moveables is not affected with the fraud of his
author, is for the &s;ake of commerce. But there
is a better rea&s;on, founded on principles of law.
A purcha&s;er of land who completes his right by
infeftment, acquires the indefea&s;ible property;
and it is a rule of ju&s;tice without a &s;ingle excep|tion,
That no man can be deprived of his pro|perty
<PB N="14" REF="27">
without his con&s;ent, unle&s;s as a puni&s;hment
where he has committed a crime. This propo&s;i|tion
is drived from the very nature of property;
and con&s;equently is equally applicable to the pur|cha&s;e
of a moveable. &startq;But the fraud of the
cedent is relevant again&s;t the a&s;&s;ignee,&endq; &s;ays his
Lord&s;hip, &startq;becau&s;e an a&s;&s;ignee is only a procu|rator.&endq;
An a&s;&s;ignment even <HI>in rem &s;uam</HI> did
not transfer the <HI>jus crediti</HI> when his Lord&s;hip
compo&s;ed his In&s;titutions; and as the a&s;&s;ignee
could only in&s;i&s;t in name of his cedent, every ob|jection
again&s;t the cedent was of cour&s;e good a|gain&s;t
him. But as an a&s;&s;ignment intimated is
now held to be a <HI>ce&s;&s;io in jure,</HI> this variation
places the purcha&s;er of a <HI>jus crediti</HI> upon the
&s;ame footing with the purcha&s;er of a moveable or
of land; and con&s;equently ought to &s;ecure him
from being liable for the fraud of his cedent.
Yet to this day, fraud is made to operate again&s;t
the a&s;&s;ignee, preci&s;ely as in the days of Lord
Stair; not adverting, that an a&s;&s;ignment is at
pre&s;ent a very different right from what it was for|merly.
Compen&s;ation is in a &s;imilar ca&s;e: it is
by cu&s;tom made effectual again&s;t an a&s;&s;ignee for
a valuable con&s;ideration, becau&s;e it was legally
effectual when an a&s;&s;ignee was only a procura|tor
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Principles of Equity, edit. 2. p. 206.</NOTE>. In this manner has our law in many par|ticulars
become a heap of incon&s;i&s;tencies: rules o|riginally
<PB N="15" REF="28">
well founded, are pre&s;erved in practice;
not only after the cau&s;es that produced them have
cea&s;ed, but cau&s;es incon&s;i&s;tent with them have
been introduced.</P>
<P>There are certain grounds in equity, that ex|tend
a reduction even again&s;t parties who had no
acce&s;&s;ion to the wrong. A reduction on the head
of fraud, though it cannot reach a <HI>bona fide</HI> pur|cha&s;er
of land or of a moveable who has given a
valuable con&s;ideration, will be &s;u&s;tained again&s;t a
purcha&s;er who has given no equivalent; on the
following ground of equity, <HI>Quod nemo debet lo|cupletari
aliena jactura,</HI> which obliges him to
yield the &s;ubject to the pur&s;uer, or to pay a ju&s;t
price<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Stair, 18th December 1667, Auchinleck <HI>contra</HI> William&s;on.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though an a&s;&s;ignment has now the effect of a
<HI>ce&s;&s;io in jure,</HI> yet where an a&s;&s;ignment to a <HI>jus
crediti</HI> has been procured by fraud, a reduction
on that head is effectual again&s;t a creditor of the
a&s;&s;ignee, arre&s;ting in the hands of the debtor.
This proceeds from the nature of an arre&s;tment.
An arre&s;tment, like an inhibition, bars voluntary
deeds only, not what are nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>i. e.</HI> what the
common debtor is bound antecedently to perform.
A landholder, for example, &s;ells his farm-victual:
an arre&s;tment laid in the hands of the tenants be|fore
delivery, but after the &s;ale, will not bar the
<PB N="16" REF="29">
common debtor from making delivery. To ap|ply
this doctrine to the ca&s;e in hand, a man who
by fraud has procured an a&s;&s;ignment to a <HI>jus cre|diti,</HI>
is bound in con&s;cience to retroce&s;s the ce|dent,
as the proper reparation of the wrong he
has done; and the retroce&s;&s;ion accordingly is a
nece&s;&s;ary act, which cannot be prevented by an
arre&s;tment. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, where a man,
con&s;cious of his in&s;olvency, purcha&s;es goods with|out
any pro&s;pect of paying the price, a reduction
on the head of fraud will be &s;u&s;tained again&s;t his
creditors, arre&s;ting the goods in the hands of the
per&s;on to whom they were delivered for his be|hoof<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Stair, Fountainhall, 22d December 1680, Prince <HI>contra</HI> Pallat; Dalrymple, Bruce, 18th January 1715, Main <HI>contra</HI> Maxwell; 8th December 1736, Sir John Inglis <HI>contra</HI> Royal Bank.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is another rea&s;on more general, that
makes a reduction on the head of fraud effectual,
not only again&s;t an arre&s;tment, but al&s;o again&s;t
other legal diligence. This rea&s;on is fully ex|plained
in the Principles of Equity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">b. 1. part 1. ch. 7. &s;ect. 2. edit. 2.</NOTE>; and is
&s;hortly what follows. &startq;That the man who by
fraud, or other illegal means, has acquired a
&s;ubject, is bound in con&s;cience to re&s;tore it to
the per&s;on injured; and therefore that a court
of equity will refu&s;e its aid to the creditors of
<PB N="17" REF="30">
the acquirer attaching the &s;ubject, who ought
not to demand from their debtor what he is
bound in con&s;cience to re&s;tore to another.&endq;
Thus, where land is purcha&s;ed fraudulently, the
vender is intitled to exclude the creditors of the
purcha&s;er from adjudging the &s;ubject. And there
is <HI>par ratio</HI> that the vender &s;hould exclude the
poinder of moveables purcha&s;ed by fraud. But
where the execution is completed, and the pro|perty
transferred, without any ob&s;truction from
the vender, he is left without remedy, except a|gain&s;t
the fraudulent purcha&s;er him&s;elf. For, as
above mentioned, it is an inviolable rule, that
property fairly transferred mu&s;t remain with the
<HI>bona fide</HI> purcha&s;er: he cannot be deprived of
his property without his con&s;ent, as no wrong can
be laid to his charge.</P>
<P>We proceed to other grounds of reduction.
An inhibition prohibits the debtor to &s;ell land, and
others to purcha&s;e, in prejudice of the inhibiter.
An inhibition therefore is a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> prohibition
only, and is not a <HI>real</HI> impediment to the convey|ance
of land. The purcha&s;er infeft becomes pro|prietor,
and is now the va&s;&s;al in place of his au|thor.
He is liable indeed to be deprived of his
purcha&s;e, having acquired it in contempt of legal
authority. But if, before an action of reduction
be commenced, he have &s;old the land, the new
purcha&s;er will be &s;ecure: he is guilty of no con|tempt
of authority, becau&s;e the per&s;on from
<PB N="18" REF="31">
whom he purcha&s;ed was not inhibited. In a
word, a reduction <HI>ex capite inhibitionis</HI> is mere|ly
a per&s;onal action, and cannot reach any one
who has not contemned the inhibition. The only
way for making an inhibition operate again&s;t &s;in|gular
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors, is to in&s;i&s;t in a proce&s;s again&s;t
the fir&s;t purcha&s;er, which, rendering the &s;ubject
litigious, prevents any to purcha&s;e from him.</P>
<P>If it be held, that the power a man has to a|lienate
his land is taken from him by law when
on deathbed, a reduction on the head of death|bed
is upon that &s;uppo&s;ition a declarator of nul|lity,
operating again&s;t every &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;&s;or;
and this was decreed in a ca&s;e reported by Foun|tainhall
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">18th December 1697, Living&s;ton <HI>contra</HI> Burn.</NOTE>. But if it be held, that a man on death|bed
retains the power of alienation that he had
when in health, and that he is limited from alie|nating
by the heir's privilege only, which &s;eems to
be the more &s;ound opinion, a deed on deathbed
is effectual again&s;t all the world, the heir only ex|cepted;
and it is effectual al&s;o again&s;t him if he
bring no challenge within forty years. Accord|ing
to that opinion, the reduction, being merely
a per&s;onal action, reaches the per&s;on only who ac|quired
from the proprietor on deathbed, and not
tho&s;e who <HI>bona fide</HI> purcha&s;e from that per&s;on for
a valuable con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Minority and le&s;ion make a ground of reduction
<PB N="19" REF="32">
only, and not, like force or fear, a <HI>real</HI> ob&s;truction
to a conveyance. A reduction on minority and
le&s;ion was accordingly &s;u&s;tained again&s;t the per|&s;on
who purcha&s;ed from the minor, but not a|gain&s;t
one to whom the purcha&s;er &s;old the &s;ub|ject
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">25th January 1728, Gourlay <HI>contra</HI> Gourlay.</NOTE>. Yet, for the rea&s;on above given, a re|duction
on this head of a di&s;po&s;ition of land, is
effectual again&s;t creditors adjudging the &s;ubject.
And in the Dictionary<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1. p. 581.</NOTE> there are many deci|&s;ions
where that point is on all hands taken for
granted.</P>
<P>If a purcha&s;er refu&s;e or delay to pay the price,
the vender may either &s;ue him at common law for
the price, or bring a proce&s;s in equity to reduce
the bargain<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, 20th July 1675, Maitland <HI>contra</HI> Gight.</NOTE>. With regard to the latter, ju&s;tice
will not &s;uffer the vender to be deprived both of
his land and of the price. This bars not the pur|cha&s;er
from &s;elling the &s;ubject, before reduction
be rai&s;ed again&s;t him; in which ca&s;e the &s;econd
purcha&s;er acting <HI>bona fide</HI> will be &s;ecure. But
the creditors of the fir&s;t purcha&s;er will be barred;
becau&s;e a court of equity will not permit them to
attach by legal execution what their debtor cannot
hold without paying the price. This in effect was
found, December 1721, Selkirk <HI>contra</HI> credi|tors
of her decea&s;ed hu&s;band. The ca&s;e was this.
<PB N="20" REF="33">
In a contract of marriage, the bride di&s;poned to
her future hu&s;band, in name of tocher, &s;ome
hou&s;es in the town of Gla&s;gow; and was provi|ded
by him in a liferent annuity of 1000 merks.
The hu&s;band died in&s;olvent; and the widow
brought a reduction of the di&s;po&s;ition granted by
her to her hu&s;band, becau&s;e the liferent annuity,
which was the price, was by his in&s;olvency ren|dered
ineffectual. It was decreed, that the cre|ditors
were barred from attaching the hou&s;es till
the pur&s;uer's liferent &s;hould be made effectual.</P>
<P>Hitherto of <HI>bona fide</HI> purcha&s;ers. Next of
<HI>mala fide</HI> purcha&s;ers, who know of the challenge
or exception that lies again&s;t the author. It is
laid down above, that the fraud of the author will
affect tho&s;e who purcha&s;e from him, knowing of
the fraud. For fraud, like other crimes, involves
the acce&s;&s;ories in the &s;ame puni&s;hment with the
principal offender; and the receipter accordingly
is held equally criminal with the thief. But it ap|pears
doubtful, how far acce&s;&s;ories to &s;lighter de|licts
are puni&s;hable by a civil court.</P>
<P>Of &s;uch delicts there are various kinds. Fir&s;t,
A delict <HI>contra bonos mores;</HI> an act not wrong in
it&s;elf, but wrong with re&s;pect to con&s;equences, as
tending to corrupt the morals of a people; &s;uch
as, purcha&s;es by a tutor, curator, factor, agent, of
debts due by the per&s;on for whom they act; pur|cha&s;es
of pleas by members of the college of ju|&s;tice;
<HI>pacta de quota litis,</HI> and &s;uch like. I di&s;|cover
<PB N="21" REF="34">
not in our practice, that the challenge which
lies again&s;t the man who makes &s;uch a purcha&s;e, is
extended again&s;t tho&s;e who purcha&s;e from him,
though privy to the wrong done by their author.
Thus, though an advocate is not &s;uffered to take
any benefit from a purcha&s;e made by him of a de|pending
proce&s;s; yet the law does not militate a|gain&s;t
tho&s;e who purcha&s;e from him, though know|ing
of the wrong.</P>
<P>Second, Wrongs done to the hurt of &s;ociety,
but not in &s;o tender a point as that of corrupting
morals; a prohibition, for example, to kill &s;al|mon
at a certain &s;ea&s;on. The tran&s;gre&s;&s;or is pu|ni&s;hed
by &s;tatute; but the per&s;on who purcha&s;es
&s;almon from him, is not liable. It is only a &s;ta|tutory
delict; and not &s;o noxious as to affect the
purcha&s;er where the law is &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Third, Prohibitions calculated for the good of
certain individuals, that have no bad tendency
with regard to others. A man who purcha&s;es
from a per&s;on inhibited, is laid open to a reduc|tion
<HI>ex capite inhibitionis.</HI> But the man who
purcha&s;es from him is &s;ecure, even though he
knew of the inhibition. He is indeed acce&s;&s;ory
to the wrong done by his author; but his con|&s;cience
does not condemn him, becau&s;e a legal
wrong affects only the per&s;on who commits it.

&s;um for improvements: and any conveyance
made by the va&s;&s;al contrary to this provi&s;ion, is
declared null. The va&s;&s;al having &s;old the land
without making an offer to his &s;uperior, a reduc|tion
was brought again&s;t the purcha&s;er by the &s;u|perior,
upon the medium, that he was in the
knowledge of the provi&s;ion in the feu-charter;
and therefore, that being acce&s;&s;ory to the fraud
of his author, his right ought to be reduced.
The purcha&s;er was a&s;&s;oilzied, as not being an&s;wer|able
for the wrong done by his author<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">4th January 1757, Sir William Stirling <HI>contra</HI> John|&s;ton.</NOTE>. An
heir of entail, prohibited to &s;ell, or to contract
debt, is guilty of a breach of engagement by &s;ell|ing;
and the per&s;on who knowingly purcha&s;es
from him is acce&s;&s;ory to the wrong. But then
the prohibition is hurtful to the public, by re|&s;training
the commerce of land; and therefore,
where &s;uch a prohibition is tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, the
wrong is &s;o &s;light as not to affect an acce&s;&s;ory.
Even where an entail is recorded, and complete
in all its &s;olemnities, yet if an heir entering fail to
engro&s;s in his infeftment the clau&s;es of the entail,
it is declared by the &s;tatute 1685, that a purcha|&s;er
from him is &s;ecure, however well acquainted
he be with the entail.</P>

Whether it would not be an improvement in
our law, to &s;ubject acce&s;&s;ories in the ca&s;es men|tioned
as well as in the ca&s;e of fraud, merits con|&s;ideration.
A man of &s;trict hone&s;ty will avoid the
tempting an heir of entail to tran&s;gre&s;s his duty;
and therefore it is not &s;trictly hone&s;t to purcha&s;e
from him. But our law has not yet acquired &s;o
much purity and refinement, as to bar purcha&s;es
where the wrong is only &s;tatutory, and not a wrong

<HEAD>ART. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Delivery of a deed.</HEAD>
<P>PAper, being a <HI>corpus,</HI> is a &s;ubject of proper|ty;
and not le&s;s &s;o for having a writing upon
it. A manu&s;cript mu&s;t belong to &s;ome per&s;on;
and none but the proprietor is intitled to hold
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or to avail him&s;elf of it. For ex|ample,
none but the proprietor is intitled to pro|duce
a deed or obligation in proce&s;s, in order to
found a claim upon it.</P>
<P>Delivery of a deed re&s;pects the manu&s;cript as
a <HI>corpus;</HI> and the u&s;e of delivery is the &s;ame
here as in other <HI>corpora,</HI> viz. to transfer the pro|perty.</P>
<P>Writings, as far as law is concerned, are of
two kinds; one that &s;erves to create a right or
obligation; and one that &s;erves for evidence on|ly.
A writing of the latter kind, whoever be the
proprietor, may be called for as evidence, pre|ci&s;ely
as a witne&s;s may be called. This is the
ca&s;e of a notary's in&s;trument, of a &s;pecial &s;ervice,
of a general &s;ervice, of a mi&s;&s;ive letter, and of ma|ny
others.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to writings of the fir&s;t kind, I
doubt whether any general rule can be given,
for determining what of them require delivery,
<PB N="25" REF="38">
what not. But to approach the neare&s;t we can to
a rule, a di&s;tinction mu&s;t be made between cove|nants
and &s;ingle deeds; as al&s;o between &s;ingle
deeds binding the granter, and &s;ingle deeds bind|ing
the heir only.</P>
<P>A mutual contract or covenant requires no deli|very
between the parties. Paper bought to write
the convenant upon, requires delivery; and being
delivered to the contractors conjunctly, it be|comes
their property in common. This &s;uper|&s;edes
the nece&s;&s;ity of any new delivery; for the
paper cannot be more or le&s;s their common pro|perty
by being written upon.</P>
<P>The &s;olemnity of delivery is therefore confined
to &s;ingle deeds. And the que&s;tion is, What nece&s;|&s;ity
there is for that &s;olemnity? A bond by which
I bind my&s;elf to pay a &s;um to any per&s;on, is my pro|perty,
&s;uppo&s;ing the paper upon which it is written
to have been &s;o. While it remains in my hand, I
can cancel it, or throw it into the fire; having the
&s;ame power over it as over any other thing that be|longs
to me. But delivery transfers the property of
the bond, as a <HI>corpus,</HI> to the creditor; who is
now intitled to u&s;e it as he plea&s;es; to make it the
foundation of a proce&s;s for payment, or to throw it
into the fire. I talk of a deed <HI>inter vivos.</HI> A deed
of a te&s;tamentary nature is different: it mu&s;t, like
other moveables, pa&s;s from the dead to the living
without delivery; otherwi&s;e it could never pa&s;s;
for there is none to make delivery after the pro|prietor's
<PB N="26" REF="39">
death. And hence it is, that by the
granter's death the property of &s;uch a deed is <HI>ip|&s;o
facto</HI> transferred to the per&s;on in who&s;e favour
it is conceived. And this holds not only in a te|&s;tament,
but in every deed that is not intended
to be delivered while the granter is alive, &s;uch as
a bond or di&s;po&s;ition re&s;erving the granter's life|rent.
But &s;uch a deed differs from a te&s;tament
in the following re&s;pect, that delivery of it to
the grantee, e&s;tabli&s;hes the right in him, leaving
nothing in the power of the granter but his life|rent
only.</P>
<P>And this leads to con&s;ider a deed <HI>inter vivos</HI>
remaining undelivered at the granter's death,
though intended to be made effectual without de|lay.
Will it be made effectual by a court of ju|&s;tice,
or is it void for want of delivery? This
que&s;tion admits no general rule; becau&s;e dif|ferent
circum&s;tances produce different conclu|&s;ions.
Some di&s;tinctions are nece&s;&s;ary to put
the&s;e circum&s;tances in a proper light. I di&s;tin|gui&s;h,
fir&s;t, a deed purely gratuitous, from a
deed proceeding from a ju&s;t cau&s;e or motive.
And I next di&s;tingui&s;h a deed purely gratuitous
containing a clau&s;e di&s;pen&s;ing with delivery, from
a deed of the &s;ame nature without that clau&s;e.</P>
<P>I begin with the la&s;t ca&s;e, becau&s;e it throws
light upon the re&s;t. A gratuitous deed <HI>inter vi|vos,</HI>
if it have not a clau&s;e di&s;pen&s;ing with deli|very,
bears naturally the con&s;truction, that the
<PB N="27" REF="40">
granter intended to make it in&s;tantly effectual by
delivery; and his forbearing to deliver, affords
a pre&s;umption of his having altered his intention.
His forbearing to de&s;troy the deed, affords no
argument on the other &s;ide; becau&s;e it may be
fairly accounted for from neglect, or want of me|mory.</P>
<P>But in a deed <HI>inter vivos,</HI> a clau&s;e di&s;pen&s;ing
with delivery is a declaration, that the granter in|tends
not to make the deed pre&s;ently effectual.
The delay therefore of delivery is no evidence of
change of mind, even though he die in the <HI>inte|rim.</HI>
And if his mind continued the &s;ame to the
hour of his death, the deed mu&s;t pa&s;s to the gran|tee,
and be effectual again&s;t the granter's repre|&s;entatives.</P>
<P>A remuneratory deed <HI>inter vivos,</HI> or one pro|ceeding
from a ju&s;t cau&s;e, requires not a clau&s;e
di&s;pen&s;ing with delivery. The delay of delivery
will not pre&s;ume a change of mind; which would
be unju&s;t, or at lea&s;t unrea&s;onable. Such a deed
therefore will, after the granter's death, be effec|tual
without delivery: the property of it will pa&s;s
to the grantee; and the repre&s;entatives of the
granter will be liable. A bond of provi&s;ion to a
child proceeds from a ju&s;t cau&s;e, viz. a natural ob|ligation
to provide children. And therefore, e|ven
where the granter binds him&s;elf as well as
his heirs, yet the forbearing to deliver will not
pre&s;ume a change of mind: the bond will be ef|fectual
<PB N="28" REF="41">
upon the granter's death again&s;t his repre|&s;entatives.</P>
<P>An a&s;&s;ignment to a bond, or a conveyance of
any other &s;ubject, will be effectual, if there was
any ju&s;t cau&s;e for granting, though the a&s;&s;ign|ment
or conveyance remain with the granter till
his death. It has accordingly been found more
than once, that an a&s;&s;ignment to a creditor for
his &s;ecurity or payment, will, after the cedent's
death, be effectual, though never delivered to
the creditor. The ca&s;e is more doubtful where
the a&s;&s;ignment is a pure gratuity. This ca&s;e lies in
the middle between a gratuitous bond <HI>inter vivos</HI>
binding the granter him&s;elf, and a gratuitous bond
<HI>mortis cau&s;a,</HI> binding his repre&s;entatives only.
Though a gratuitous a&s;&s;ignment be framed in the
pre&s;ent ten&s;e, that circum&s;tance will &s;carce infer
an intention to make the a&s;&s;ignment pre&s;ently ef|fectual;
for which rea&s;on the forbearing to deli|ver
will not pre&s;ume change of mind, at lea&s;t not
&s;o clearly as the forbearing to deliver a bond
binding the granter. This ca&s;e appears extreme|ly
arbitrary, and forces the mind to look about
for &s;ome determining circum&s;tance. May it not
be thought, that &s;uch an a&s;&s;ignment to a near re|lation
will be effectual without delivery; not
where it is to a &s;tranger, e&s;pecially if the granter
live long after executing the a&s;&s;ignment?</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Form of completing marriage by the law
of Scotland.</HEAD>
<P>FEW branches of our law are handled with
le&s;s preci&s;ion, than what particulars are ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to complete a marriage. There is a dark|ne&s;s
and confu&s;ion in our writers, from jumbling
together three points that are clearly di&s;tinct.
The fir&s;t is, What &s;olemnities are nece&s;&s;ary to
complete a marriage? The &s;econd, What cir|cum&s;tances
are &s;ufficient to pre&s;ume, that mar|riage
has been regularly &s;olemnized? And the
third, What circum&s;tances are &s;ufficient to oblige
a party by a proce&s;s to &s;olemnize a marriage?</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, Marriage required no
&s;olemnity before the time of Pope Innocent III.
The bridegroom went to the hou&s;e where the
bride lived, and led her home to his own hou&s;e;
by which &s;imple form, they became hu&s;band and
wife. But a ceremony &s;o &s;light giving occa&s;ion
to many que&s;tions about marriage, both with re|gard
to the parties and their i&s;&s;ue, marriage in
the church before the prie&s;t was e&s;tabli&s;hed as an
e&s;&s;ential &s;olemnity. Thus, though con&s;ent may,
<HI>in foro poli,</HI> make a marriage; yet, in all civilized
countries, certain &s;olemnities are requi&s;ite to com|plete
<PB N="30" REF="43">
a marriage; and public utility makes the&s;e
&s;olemnities indi&s;pen&s;able, in order to remove
doubts about lawful i&s;&s;ue, and to prevent the
intricacy and uncertainty of parole-evidence. In
England, a marriage mu&s;t be celebrated <HI>in facie
eccle&s;iae:</HI> in Holland, there mu&s;t be proclamation
of bans: in Scotland, this proclamation is u&s;eful
for the greater &s;olemnity, and to give opportunity
for objecting to the marriage; but the prie&s;t's
ble&s;&s;ing appears to be the only &s;olemnity that is
indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;econd point, Though a
marriage had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted twenty, thirty, or forty
years; yet, if called in que&s;tion, it was nece&s;&s;ary,
by the original law of this kingdom, to bring e|vidence
of the &s;olemnization. To make &s;o im|portant
a fact as marriage to depend for ever up|on
oral evidence, was &s;tretching law beyond the
bounds of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e; and the
hard&s;hip was corrected by act 77. parl. 1503, &s;et|ting
forth, That widows, in pro&s;ecuting the brieve
of terce, were often embarra&s;&s;ed by being obli|ged
to prove their marriage; therefore enacting,
That if the marriage be not objected to in the
man's life, it &s;hall be &s;ufficient to obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the terce, that the pur&s;uer was habite and re|pute
to be the man's lawful wife during his life,
&startq;until it be clearly decerned, and &s;entence gi|ven,
that &s;he was not his lawful wife.&endq; This
act of parliament has been ju&s;tly extended in prac|tice,
<PB N="31" REF="44">
to &s;ecure a hu&s;band in his courte&s;y; to pre|vent
children from being held as ba&s;tards; and,
in ca&s;e of de&s;ertion after &s;ome years cohabita|tion,
to &s;ave the trouble of proving, that the mar|riage
was regularly &s;olemnized. This pre&s;ump|tion
in favour of marriage obtains in England as
well as here; and from the nature of the thing,
mu&s;t obtain in every country where law is a
&s;cience.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the third point, viz. What cir|cum&s;tances
are &s;ufficient to oblige a party by a
proce&s;s to &s;olemnize a marriage, I ob&s;erve, that
among the Romans, mutual con&s;ent to &s;olemnize
marriage at a time &s;pecified, termed <HI>&s;pon&s;alia,</HI>
did not oblige the parties to complete the mar|riage;
&s;ubjecting only the party who repented to
a claim of damages. Afterward, either party
might draw back, upon forfeiting the arles; and
by a law of the Emperor Leo, it was declared,
that the <HI>&s;pon&s;alia</HI> might be fortified with a pe|nal
&s;tipulation<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Voet De &s;pon&s;alibus, &s;ect. 12.</NOTE>. We probably borrowed this
law from the Romans. Balfour (Marriage) &s;ays,
that a contract to complete the band of marriage
within a day named, under the penalty of a cer|tain
&s;um to the King, and another &s;um as dama|ges
to the party willing to perform, is lawful and
effectual. And Spotti&s;wood (Marriage) is of
the &s;ame opinion. But our later practice admits
<PB N="32" REF="45">
change of mind; and action is not &s;u&s;tained for
the penalty. But there is no rea&s;on why dama|ges
&s;hould not be due<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dictionary,</HI> Locus poenitentiae, in fine.</NOTE>. The law of Holland is
different. A mutual promi&s;e of marriage even
<HI>de futuro,</HI> is a good foundation for an action to
compel the refractory party to complete the mar|riage,
unle&s;s there be a mid-impediment by a
&s;ub&s;equent marriage regularly &s;olemnized. In
England the &s;ame law obtains. Though a pri|vate
contract, without the prie&s;t's ble&s;&s;ing, makes
not a marriage, yet &s;uch contract may be enfor|ced
in the &s;piritual court<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">New Abridgement of the law, vol. 3. p. 575.</NOTE>. In the law of Scot|land,
though a private contract is not binding to
oblige either party to &s;olemnize marriage; yet
&s;uch a contract, with a &s;ub&s;equent <HI>copula,</HI> is &s;uf|ficient.
For though there be <HI>locus poenitentiae</HI>
after &s;uch a contract <HI>rebus integris;</HI> yet, where a
<HI>copula</HI> follows upon the faith of &s;uch a contract,
it would be unju&s;t to permit either of the parties
to draw back; e&s;pecially the man, when the wo|man
has &s;urrendered her per&s;on to him. And
accordingly an action is given in the &s;piritual
court, as in England, to oblige the refractory
per&s;on to &s;olemnize the marriage. Craig ex|plains
the nature of this action, which concludes
again&s;t the party drawing back, that he or &s;he
&s;hall be obliged to &s;olemnize the marriage. The
<PB N="33" REF="46">
con&s;equence is, that upon refu&s;al, the marriage
is declared complete; and the decree of the com|mi&s;&s;aries
&s;tands in place of the &s;olemnity. &startq;Com|mi&s;&s;arii,

obliged to &s;olemnize the marriage, &s;eeing he had
children by the woman under promi&s;e of mar|riage.</P>
<P>From &s;ome loo&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of Lord Stair in
the title of Marriage, an opinion has prevailed of
late years, that a promi&s;e of marriage, with a
&s;ub&s;equent <HI>copula,</HI> are alone &s;ufficient to con&s;ti|tute
marriage, without nece&s;&s;ity of the mini&s;ter's
ble&s;&s;ing, or of any other &s;olemnity. And what
probably has paved the way to that opinion, is,
that among Prote&s;tants marriage is not held to be
a &s;acrament; from which it has ra&s;hly been infer|red,
<PB N="34" REF="47">
that there is no nece&s;&s;ity for a mini&s;ter.
But that this is an erroneous opinion, will appear
from the following con&s;ideration. If a promi&s;e
of it&s;elf be not effectual, the &s;ub&s;equent <HI>copula,</HI>
an unlawful act, can never be con&s;idered as a le|gal
&s;olemnity, &s;ufficient to complete the marriage.
The <HI>copula</HI> cannot regularly have any other ef|fect
than to bar repentance; and con&s;equently to
oblige the party refractory to perform the promi&s;e.
Nor is this opinion con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of
law in any civilized country concerning marriage.
Marriage produces many important con&s;equen|ces.
It a&s;certains the condition of the married
couple, of their children, and of the right the&s;e
children have to &s;ucceed to their relations. It
may have an effect with re&s;pect to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
to the crown it&s;elf, the mo&s;t important que&s;tion
of all that concern civil &s;ociety. Our law, for
the&s;e rea&s;ons, di&s;&s;atisfied with the private &s;olem|nity
of carrying the bride to the bridegroom's
hou&s;e accompanied with her friends, though a
public act, required the &s;olemnity to be performed
by proclamation of bans, and by mutual con&s;ent
given <HI>in facie eccle&s;iae</HI> before the prie&s;t, and
completed with his ble&s;&s;ing. Now, to hold a
promi&s;e of marriage, <HI>cum copula,</HI> two acts of the
mo&s;t private nature, and mo&s;t uncertain proof,
to be equal to a marriage regularly &s;olemnized, is
to overturn the whole &s;y&s;tem of our law with re|gard
to marriage, and to render it much more
<PB N="35" REF="48">
uncertain, than even the <HI>inductio in domum ma|riti.</HI>
The pernicious effects of this opinion reach
&s;till farther. For at that rate, the mo&s;t &s;olemn
marriage will not &s;ecure a woman even of the
highe&s;t rank, nor her children: a low woman
appears, who &s;ucceeds in proving a promi&s;e <HI>cum
copula</HI> by witne&s;&s;es of her own rank, perhaps en|gaged
privately to partake of the &s;poil. What
a di&s;mal &s;cene does this produce!</P>
<P>The proclamation of bans proves, to my con|viction,
that a promi&s;e <HI>cum copula</HI> makes not an
actual marriage. The intention of proclamation
is, to invite people to forbid the bans, if they
have any legal objection. A promi&s;e of marriage
will not intitle one to forbid the bans, becau&s;e of
<HI>locus poenitentiae;</HI> and if a promi&s;e with <HI>copula</HI>
make an actual marriage, the woman's failure to
appear at the proclamation, to claim the man as
her hu&s;band, and to forbid the bans with another
woman, will not annul her marriage. At that rate
proclamation is of no u&s;e. An additional argument
may be drawn from the above-mentioned act of
parliament. Cohabitation as man and wife
makes not a marriage; but only infers, that the
marriage was regularly &s;olemnized, unle&s;s the
contrary be proved. To di&s;prove the marriage,
there is always acce&s;s to the oath of party; and
con&s;equently, by that &s;tatute, cohabitation is not
&s;ufficient without the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;olemnity. But
a promi&s;e <HI>cum copula</HI> can never be &s;tronger than
<PB N="36" REF="49">
cohabitation as man and wife, which is a mutual
acknowledgement of marriage <HI>robus et factis,</HI>
and often by expre&s;s words. This is at lea&s;t e|quivalent
to a promi&s;e: the <HI>copula</HI> is pre&s;umed
from cohabitation; and if there be children, is
certain.</P>
<P>It would appear from a ca&s;e ob&s;erved by Du|rie
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Craig <HI>contra</HI> Sinclair, 16th December 1628.</NOTE>, that even a decree of the commi&s;&s;aries is
not &s;ufficient to complete the marriage. Mar|garet
Craig having obtained a decree of the com|mi&s;&s;aries
of Edinburgh again&s;t Oliver Sinclair, to
complete the band of marriage with her before
the face of Holy Kirk, he gave bond to &s;olem|nize
the marriage within a day &s;pecified, and, in
ca&s;e of failure, to pay her 500 merks. This
bond being put in &s;uit, it was alledged for Oli|ver,
that by the decree he was the pur&s;uer's hu&s;|band,
and that &s;he could not have action again&s;t
her own hu&s;band. This alledgeance was repel|led,
becau&s;e till the marriage &s;hould be &s;olemni|zed,
he was not actually her hu&s;band. This
judgement was agreeable to the decree of the
commi&s;&s;aries decerning the man to &s;olemnize the
marriage. But as it is not in the power of any
judge to force the will, I &s;hould imagine, that a
decree obliging the parties to &s;olemnize, and up|on
failure, that the marriage &s;hould be declared
complete, would make an actual marriage.
<PB N="37" REF="50">
However that be, the deci&s;ion &s;hews the &s;en&s;e of
the nation at that time, that a promi&s;e <HI>cum co|pula</HI>
is not equivalent to an actual marriage.</P>
<P>I conclude this article with a remarkable deci|&s;ion,

as follows. In February 1748, Ali&s;on Penny|cook
brought a proce&s;s before the commi&s;&s;aries
of Edinburgh, again&s;t John Grinton, &s;etting
forth, That &s;he had born a child to him under
promi&s;e of marriage; and concluding for main|tenance
of the child, and for L. 100 Sterling of
damages for his debauching and leaving her.
The libel being referred to his oath, he acknow|ledged
the child, and his promi&s;e of marriage
before he had carnal dealing with the pur&s;uer.
The proce&s;s was di&s;continued till January 1751;
during which interval, John Grinton, finding that
the pur&s;uer had damages only in view, thought
him&s;elf at liberty to propo&s;e marriage to Anne
Graite; and &s;he and her father having agreed to
the propo&s;al, the marriage was &s;olemnized open|ly,
but without proclamation of bans. There
was a meeting of friends, a marriage-dinner, and
a formal bedding: the new-married couple went
publicly to church in that quality, continued to
cohabit as hu&s;band and wife, in the neighbour|hood
of Ali&s;on Pennycook, without any challenge
from her; and a child was procreated of the mar|riage.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="51">
This moved Ali&s;on Pennycook to vary her at|tack.
De&s;erting her depending proce&s;s, &s;he, in
January 1751, brought a new proce&s;s before the
commi&s;&s;ary-court, libelling upon the promi&s;e and
<HI>copula;</HI> &s;ub&s;uming, That, notwith&s;tanding thereof,
John Grinton had not only de&s;erted her, but had
committed adultery publicly with another woman;
and therefore concluding, that John Grinton
and &s;he &s;hould be declared married per&s;ons, and
the child procreated betwixt them a lawful child;
al&s;o concluding, that becau&s;e of his notour adul|tery,
&s;he &s;hould be divorced, and intitled to all
the privileges of a widow, as if he were naturally
dead. In this proce&s;s, the commi&s;&s;aries found
it proved by the defendant's oath, mentioned a|bove,
that he had carnal dealings with her under
promi&s;e of marriage, and that he had a child by
her: therefore found the marriage proved; de|clared
the defendant and pur&s;uer hu&s;band and
wife, and the child a lawful child. But as to the
conclu&s;ion of divorce, they permitted the pur&s;uer,
before an&s;wer, to prove the facts and circum&s;tan|ces
libelled for inferring the &s;ame. This proce&s;s,
with a counter proce&s;s, at the in&s;tance of Anne
Graite, for declaring her marriage with John
Grinton, being brought before the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion
by advocation, it was pleaded for John Grin|ton
and Anne Graite, that a promi&s;e <HI>cum copu|la</HI>
may, <HI>rebus integris,</HI> found an action to oblige
the party to complete the marriage; but is not
<PB N="39" REF="52">
an actual marriage, to void a &s;ub&s;equent mar|riage
lawfully contracted. The judges were al|mo&s;t
unanimous, that a promi&s;e <HI>cum copula</HI>
makes a complete marriage; and therefore they
repelled the rea&s;on of advocation, and remitted
the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>As John Grinton's marriage with Anne Graite
was &s;o far clande&s;tine as that it proceeded with|out
proclamation of bans, it de&s;erves con&s;idera|tion,
what weight ought to be laid on the omi&s;|&s;ion
of that &s;olemnity. Had the bans been pro|claimed,
the pur&s;uer ought to have appeared to
forbid the bans. And &s;uppo&s;ing her not to have
appeared, the marriage, in my apprehen&s;ion,
mu&s;t have been unexceptionable. But &s;ince there
was no proclamation of bans to give the pur|&s;uer
opportunity to appear for her intere&s;t, it
may be ju&s;tly doubted, whether her claim did
not remain entire to operate a di&s;&s;olution of the
&s;ub&s;equent clande&s;tine marriage, and to compel
John Grinton to &s;olemnize the marriage with
her. I am verily per&s;uaded, that this particular
had weight with the judges, though it entered
not into their rea&s;oning, nor is expre&s;&s;ed in the
judgement. If a ca&s;e of this kind be brought a|gain
before the court, where the bans have been
regularly proclaimed, and every other &s;olemnity
u&s;ed, I cannot allow my&s;elf to think, that the
judges would be &s;o har&s;h, as to void the mar|riage
upon no better ground than a promi&s;e of
marriage to another woman <HI>cum copula.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Provi&s;ion of conque&s;t in a contract of
marriage.</HEAD>
<P>WHere a man is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an e&s;tate &s;uffi|cient
for providing his wife and children,
there is no occa&s;ion for a provi&s;ion of conque&s;t.
But men of bu&s;ine&s;s often marry upon the faith
of future acqui&s;itions, and upon the&s;e the wife
depends for a provi&s;ion to her&s;elf and to her i&s;|&s;ue.
There, a provi&s;ion of conque&s;t is nece&s;&s;ary;
and for that rea&s;on, extremely favourable. Some
contracts of marriage have a mixture of both,
as where a man provides the &s;mall &s;tock he hath
to his wife or children, and al&s;o his future ac|qui&s;itions.</P>
<P>A &s;ubject is not termed conque&s;t merely for
having been purcha&s;ed during marriage. No|thing
is held to be conque&s;t, but what is an ac|ce&s;&s;ion
to a man's fortune, making him <HI>locuple|tior.</HI>
A &s;ubject purcha&s;ed with money acquired
by indu&s;try or economy, is in the true &s;en&s;e con|que&s;t.
But land, or any other &s;ubject, purcha&s;ed
with borrowed money, is not conque&s;t; except
as far as the &s;ubject may be of greater value than
the price paid for it.</P>
<P>This being the true notion of conque&s;t, even
<PB N="41" REF="54">
in the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, it follows, 1&s;t,
That whatever &s;ubjects a man may acquire du|ring
a marriage, yet the&s;e are only held to be
conque&s;t as far as they exceed in value what the
man was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of at the date of the contract<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Stair, b. 3. tit. 5. &sect; 52.</NOTE>.
2d. They are only held to be conque&s;t, as far as
they exceed in value the debts which the purcha|&s;er
found it nece&s;&s;ary to contract in order to pay
the price<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled the meaning of conque&s;t in ge|neral,
the fir&s;t particular I begin with is, the im|port
of the different clau&s;es in common u&s;e;
&s;ome more exten&s;ive, &s;ome le&s;s, according to a|greement.
And with re&s;pect to every provi&s;ion
of this &s;ort, one negative rule holds, That being
partly calculated to excite the wife's frugality
and indu&s;try, it is not extended to what devolves
on the hu&s;band by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s &s;o expre&s;&s;|ed

<P>What &s;ubjects are comprehended under a
clau&s;e of conque&s;t, depends on the will of par|ties,
&s;ignified by the words of the clau&s;e. A
provi&s;ion to a wife, &startq;of the liferent of all lands
and annualrents to be conque&s;t during the

were held to be <HI>feoda pecuniae,</HI> and con&s;e|quently
a &s;ort of annualrent-right. But after
&s;uch bonds were rendered moveable by &s;tatute,
the court gave a different opinion. A liferent
provided to the wife, &startq;of what lands, teinds,
and annualrents, &s;hould be conque&s;t during the
marriage,&endq; was not extended to moveable
bonds bearing intere&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Harcar&s;e, Deci&s;. 342.</NOTE>. But a liferent provi|ded
to a wife, &startq;of a third part of all lands and
heritages that &s;hould be conque&s;t during the
marriage,&endq; was extended to a bond &s;eciuding ex|ecutors,
as being heritage<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Harcar&s;e, Deci&s;. 343.</NOTE>. A liferent provided
to the wife, &startq;of all lands, annualrents, goods, and
gear, that &s;hould be conque&s;t during the mar|riage,&endq;
was not extended to moveable bonds<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Stair, 15th July 1673, Robi&s;on <HI>contra</HI> Robi&s;on.</NOTE>.
A provi&s;ion, &startq;of all goods and gear to be con|que&s;t
during the marriage, to the children that
&s;hould be procreated of that marriage,&endq; was
not extended to hou&s;es, becau&s;e lands and heri|tages
were not mentioned<NOTE N="&ast;&ast;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 5th February 1696, Young <HI>contra</HI> Young.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A man bound by contract of marriage to in|feft
<PB N="43" REF="56">
his wife in all future conque&s;ts, acquired land
holding burgage, which, by acts of the town,
could only be enjoyed by burge&s;&s;es, and their
heirs-male. It was decreed, that his heir-male
&s;hould make good to her the rents for her life<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hadington, 14th March 1623, Skene <HI>contra</HI> Forbes.</NOTE>.
For the land was undoubtedly conque&s;t; and
though &s;he was barred from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the land,
there was nothing to bar her from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the
rents.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider a clau&s;e of conque&s;t with
re&s;pect to its import, it is not &s;ufficient to &s;ay,
that &s;uch and &s;uch &s;ubjects are comprehended in
it: we mu&s;t al&s;o be able to &s;ay, that the&s;e &s;ub|jects
were acquired during the marriage. This
point is &s;ometimes doubtful; as where a pur|cha&s;e,
inchoated before the marriage, is comple|ted
during it. It is not ea&s;y to give a general
rule, for determining a point frequently involved
in circum&s;tances. Que&s;tions of this nature com|monly
occur about land, to which there are ti|tles
of different kinds. All I can &s;ay in general
is, that acqui&s;ition of the &s;overeign title of pro|perty,
is the determining circum&s;tance. If that
was in the hu&s;band before the marriage, the ac|qui&s;ition
of collateral or inferior rights during the
marriage, will not be reputed conque&s;t. And
the property will be reputed conque&s;t, if it be
acquired during the marriage, whatever collate|ral
<PB N="44" REF="57">
or inferior rights were formerly in the hu&s;|band.
Thus, a provi&s;ion to the heirs of a &s;e|cond
marriage, &startq;of lands that &s;hould be acquired
during the marriage,&endq; was not extended to
land to which the hu&s;band had a title of proper|ty
before the marriage; though &s;everal collateral
rights were purcha&s;ed during the marriage. For
even &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e to be preferable titles, yet
the parties certainly did not intend to bring un|der
&s;uch a clau&s;e any land to which the hu&s;band
had already a title of property. Nor were the&s;e
purcha&s;es during the marriage brought under
the provi&s;ion of conque&s;t; becau&s;e neither could
it be the meaning of parties, to &s;plit different
titles to the &s;ame &s;ubject among near relations,
to produce di&s;cord and law-&s;uits among them<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Harcar&s;e, Deci&s;. 352. See Dury, 30th June 1629, Lady Dunfermline.</NOTE>.
On the other hand, a man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the life|rent
of land at the date of his contract, having
afterward made a purcha&s;e of the property, the
land, after his death, was decreed to fall under
the provi&s;ion of conque&s;t<NOTE N="dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 12th December 1707, Fergus <HI>contra</HI> Burrel.</NOTE>. And a man who was
bound to infeft his wife &startq;in all lands and herita|ges
that &s;hould be conque&s;t during the mar|riage,&endq;
having fir&s;t acquired tacks of certain
lands, which fell not under the provi&s;ion, and
afterward the property of the land; the relict
<PB N="45" REF="58">
was found intitled to liferent the land. But the
benefit of the tacks was &s;ubtracted; becau&s;e &s;o
far the lands could not be reputed conque&s;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Durie, 12th March 1628, Lady Dunfermline.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We come next in order to &s;ay, with what debts
a provi&s;ion of conque&s;t is burdened. Suppo&s;ing
the whole &s;ubjects, heritable and moveable, that
&s;hall be conque&s;t during the marriage to be pro|vided,
this provi&s;ion mu&s;t of cour&s;e be burdened
with all the debts contracted during the marriage.
For, as above laid down, &s;ubjects acquired du|ring
the marriage, are only held to be conque&s;t,
as far as the purcha&s;er is thereby <HI>locupletior;</HI>
and he is not <HI>locupletior,</HI> if he have contracted
debt for paying the price. But &s;uppo&s;ing the
&s;ubjects acquired during the marriage to be &s;uffi|cient
for all the debts contracted during that pe|riod,
a provi&s;ion of heritable &s;ubjects will only
be burdened with heritable debts, and a provi&s;ion
of moveable &s;ubjects, with moveable debts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, 23d December 1668, Smith <HI>contra</HI> Muir.</NOTE>. If
there be no &s;eparate fund for paying the debts, the
provi&s;ion, were it even of land only, mu&s;t be bur|dened
with the whole; for, as ob&s;erved, nothing
is held to be conque&s;t, but what is free after pay|ment
of debts.</P>
<P>To prevent mi&s;takes, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the
debts I am talking of, are tho&s;e only where the
money has been applied for making purcha&s;es
<PB N="46" REF="59">
during the marriage. If a debt be contracted,
and the money be gifted to a relation or friend,
this debt cannot burden a provi&s;ion of conque&s;t,
if the debtor have any other funds for payment.
Or if, during a &s;econd marriage the conque&s;t of
which is provided to the wife or children, the
hu&s;band contract debt, and apply the money for
purging incumbrances upon his e&s;tate de&s;cendible
to the heir of the fir&s;t marriage, the provi&s;ion
will not be burdened with that debt. The rea&s;on
is, that the &s;ubjects falling under the provi&s;ion,
having been acquired without the aid of this con|traction,
make a real acce&s;&s;ion to the man's e|&s;tate;
and are therefore properly conque&s;t. Nor
is there any rea&s;on for burdening a provi&s;ion
with a debt that has not contributed to the ac|qui&s;ition
of the &s;ubjects provided.</P>
<P>Where the whole moveables are provided, or
the whole heritable &s;ubjects, there can be no dif|ficulty
about the debts. The provi&s;ion mu&s;t be
burdened with debts of its own kind. But what
if a &s;ingle &s;pecies only be provided, &s;uch as lands,
or bonded debts? The provi&s;ion, as appears to
me, mu&s;t be burdened with a proportion only of
the debts. If land for example that &s;hall be
conque&s;t, be provided to the wife in liferent, or
the children in fee; and, at the di&s;&s;olution of the
marriage, there be not only land, but al&s;o heri|table
bonds; the whole heritable debts mu&s;t not
be laid upon the land: the other heritable &s;ub|jects
<PB N="47" REF="60">
mu&s;t bear a proportion. The like when
moveable bonds only are provided: the other
moveables mu&s;t contribute to pay the moveable
debts.</P>
<P>There is a &s;pecialty with re&s;pect to a provi&s;ion
of land. Land acquired during the marriage,
mu&s;t pa&s;s to the wife or children <HI>cum &s;uo onere;</HI>
that is, with the burden of heritable bonds &s;ecu|red
upon it. The wife, provided to the liferent,
mu&s;t pay the intere&s;t; and the children, provi|ded
to the fee, mu&s;t pay the principal; without
being intitled to any relief out of the other heri|table
&s;ubjects that have been acquired during the
marriage. The court has gone farther in &s;ome
in&s;tances: it has found, that land purcha&s;ed du|ring
a marriage, mu&s;t be burdened with what
part of the price remains &s;till due to the vender,
though due by a moveable bond, but &s;pecifying
the &s;um to be part of the price<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Durie, 24th January 1629, Lady Renton; Stair, 20th December 1665, Lady Kilbucho.</NOTE>. It has proba|bly
been thought, that the land could not be en|tirely
conque&s;t, while any part of the price re|mained
unpaid. But this, I think, is too &s;trict.
Suppo&s;ing the land to be the only &s;ubject purcha|&s;ed
during the marriage, it mu&s;t no doubt be
burdened, not only with what remains due of the
price, but al&s;o with all the other debts. But &s;up|po&s;ing
other &s;ubjects to have been acquired be&s;ide
the land, I di&s;cover no good rea&s;on for laying the
<PB N="48" REF="61">
price entirely upon the land. Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed,
that the hu&s;band, &s;oon after the marriage, being
tempted with a beneficial purcha&s;e of land, bor|rows
money to buy it. Being engaged in profit|able
bu&s;ine&s;s, he afterward buys hou&s;es, obtains
adjudications, and lends &s;ums upon per&s;onal
bonds. Dying in this condition, it mu&s;t be ad|mitted,
that the land he acquired is, in the &s;trict|e&s;t
&s;en&s;e, conque&s;t. I am therefore inclined to
think, that the moveable &s;ubjects ought, in the
fir&s;t place, to be applied for paying the price as
a moveable debt; and if the&s;e be not &s;ufficient,
that the remainder of the debt be allocated pro|portionally
upon the land, and upon the other
heritable &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The point of the greate&s;t intricacy, is, How far
the granter is limited in the exerci&s;e of his pro|perty
by a provi&s;ion of conque&s;t. As to this
point, &s;pecial regard mu&s;t be had to the intention
of the parties. A provi&s;ion of what &s;hall be
acquired during a marriage, to a wife in liferent,
or to children in fee, will not readily be &s;o inter|preted,
as to deprive the man of his inherent
power, <HI>qua</HI> proprietor, to manage and di&s;po&s;e of
his effects. If he lend money during the mar|riage,
he may take payment; and if he buy a
hor&s;e, or even land, he may di&s;po&s;e of it: a pro|vi&s;ion
of conque&s;t will be no impediment<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Stair, b. 3. tit. 5. &sect; 52.; Durie, 26th Novem|ber 1629, Lady Dunfermline.</NOTE>. For,
<PB N="49" REF="62">
as &s;uch provi&s;ion re&s;pects the di&s;&s;olution of the
marriage, and operates not till the hu&s;band's
death, nothing is held conque&s;t but what remains
in his <HI>hereditas jacens.</HI> There is therefore no|thing
in the nature of &s;uch a provi&s;ion, to pre|vent
the hu&s;band from aliening by a deed <HI>inter
vivos</HI> any &s;ubject acquired by him during the
marriage. The common law accordingly admits
no objection to an alienation dive&s;ting the granter,
whatever may have been his motive. But were
&s;uch alienations to be countenanced without li|mitation,
a provi&s;ion of conque&s;t in a marriage|&s;ettlement,
however &s;alutary, would prove a very
&s;lender &s;ecurity. The hu&s;band cannot indeed
counteract his engagement directly; but he may
do the equivalent indirectly, by aliening to his fa|vourites
all that he hath acquired during the
marriage. A court of equity takes more liberty,
in order to fulfil the rules of ju&s;tice. It will not bar
deeds done in the cour&s;e of ordinary admini&s;tra|tion:
nor will it even bar deeds done without a valu|able
con&s;ideration, provided they be rational, pro|ceeding
from an hone&s;t motive, with no intention
to di&s;appoint the wife and children. To give
more indulgence, would be to &s;uffer the hu&s;band
to do wrong with impunity. Common law re|gards
only the granter's power when he makes a
deed; but equity regards his intention, and
will reduce every deed that proceeds from a frau|dulent
or unju&s;t motive. When a man acts indi|rectly
<PB N="50" REF="63">
to evade a contract, or a &s;tatute, he is &s;aid,
in law-language, <HI>fraudem facere contractui aut
legi;</HI> and it is the province of a court of equi|ty
to void unju&s;t acts. I give examples. A wo|man
in her contract of marriage being provided
&startq;to the liferent of what &s;ubjects the hu&s;band
&s;hould conque&s;t, and of what &s;ums he &s;hould
receive in payment during the marriage,&endq; was
not intitled to the liferent of &s;ums paid to the

by him for purging incumbrances upon his
e&s;tate<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Harcar&s;e, Deci&s;. 398.</NOTE>. For here the money was not extant at
the di&s;&s;olution of the marriage; and the appli|cation
of the money to purge incumbrances was
a rational act, and not a <HI>fraus facta contractui.</HI>
A man who became bound to provide his wife to
the liferent &startq;of all &s;ums that &s;hould be conque&s;t
during the marriage,&endq; lends out &s;ums thus ac|quired,
and takes the debtors bound to pay the

claim to the liferent of the&s;e &s;ums, which being
no more but a competent provi&s;ion, will not be
held as done intentionally to di&s;appoint the life|rent
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Durie, 10th February 1629, Oliphant <HI>contra</HI> Finnie.</NOTE>. On the other hand, where the liferent

being, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, a creditor, is intitled,
in all events, to have the obligation fulfilled to
her; but that the children, being only heirs of
provi&s;ion, are not intitled to bar any deeds but
what are fraudulent. But, upon revolving the
&s;ubject more attentively, there appears no ground
for a difference. A provi&s;ion of conque&s;t intitles
the widow to every &s;ubject falling under the pro|vi&s;ion
that belonged to the hu&s;band at the di&s;&s;olu|tion
of the marriage. But with re&s;pect to &s;ub|jects
acquired, and aliened by him, during the
marriage; the&s;e, in terms of the provi&s;ion, fall
not under conque&s;t; and therefore &s;he has no
title to challenge any alienation of that kind, un|le&s;s
&s;he can qualify it to be fraudulent; and the
children evidently have the &s;ame privilege. Per|haps
it may be thought &s;hallow, ever to have en|tertained
a doubt about this point; but I hazard
the imputation, to prevent others from lo&s;ing time

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Seal of Cau&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>WHen a village, by a charter from the
crown, is erected into a burgh-royal, a
burgh of regality, or a burgh of barony, the in|habitants
are <HI>eo ip&s;o</HI> incorporated into a body|politic,
enjoying all the privileges granted by the
charter; and their right of burge&s;s&s;hip is commu|nicated
to their de&s;cendents, with all the privi|leges
con&s;equent upon it. At the &s;ame time,
the increa&s;e of the burgh being always in view as
well as its perpetuity, a power is granted in the
charter to the magi&s;trates, to the lord of rega|lity,
or to the baron, to admit &s;trangers into the
corporation, and to make them burge&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>As &s;uch erections are made for the &s;ake of
commerce, the erecting the inhabitants of a vil|lage
into a corporation, is under&s;tood to imply an
exclu&s;ive privilege to the burge&s;&s;es, of exerci&s;ing
merchandi&s;e and manufactures within the burgh.
The clau&s;e commonly is, &startq;That the burge&s;&s;es
&s;hall have free liberty of commerce; and that
there &s;hall be liberty of admitting bakers, tai|lors,
&s;hoemakers, &amp;c. with power to the &s;aid
artificers to exerci&s;e their re&s;pective crafts, as
freely as is done in other burghs.&endq; It is ac|cordingly
<PB N="54" REF="67">
laid down in the New Abridgement of
the law<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Tit. Corporation, p. 499.</NOTE>, &startq;That a corporation is an artificial
body of men, compo&s;ed of divers con&s;tituent
members, <HI>ad in&s;tar corporis humani;</HI> the li|gaments
of which body-politie, or artificial bo|dy,
are the franchi&s;es and liberties thereof,
which bind and unite all its members together.
And the whole frame and effence of the corpo|ration
con&s;i&s;ts therein.&endq;</P>
<P>It is a principle of law, That a corporation, or
body-politic, cannot be created by any but by
the crown. See the book above quoted<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tit. Corporation, p. 501.</NOTE>;
where it is &s;aid, &startq;That a corporation created by
the mayor and common council of London,
is not good without the King's charter.&endq; It
is therefore to me clear, that a &s;eal of cau&s;e
granted by the magi&s;trates of a royal burgh, by
a lord of regality, or by a baron, to a craft or
trade, the weavers, for example, or the ma&s;ons,
cannot have the effect of erecting them into a
corporation. Nor do the &s;eals of cau&s;e I have per|u&s;ed,
appear to have been intended for making
an incorporation. No more is done, but to
delegate to the craft it&s;elf, the privilege of
admitting new members; a privilege that the
granters have by the charter of erection; to
impower al&s;o the craft to make by-laws; and
to have a box and common good for the u&s;e of
<PB N="55" REF="68">
their poor. The &s;eal of cau&s;e granted 31&s;t of
January 1475, by the magi&s;trates and town-coun|cil
of Edinburgh, to the weaver-craft, has no
clau&s;e erecting them into a corporation. It goes
no farther, than to regulate the common con|cerns
of the craft, and to bar unfreemen. In the
&s;ame &s;train run the &s;eals of cau&s;e granted to the
hammermen, 2d May 1483; to the tailors, 26th
Augu&s;t 1500; to the cordiners, 6th December
1513; and to the gold&s;miths, 20th Augu&s;t 1581.
In the &s;eal of cau&s;e, <HI>anno</HI> 1505, granted by the
magi&s;trates and town-council of Edinburgh to
the &s;urgeons and barbers, there are no words e|recting
them into a corporation: a &s;et of by|laws
propo&s;ed by the craft are ratified, and no
more is done. By an act of the town-council of
Edinburgh, the &s;urgeons and apothecaries are e|rected
into one community. But to &s;upply the
defect of power, the act was confirmed by
Charles II. and ratified in parliament, 22d Au|gu&s;t

<P>By an act of the &s;ame town-council, <HI>anno</HI>
1684, the bonnetmakers and lit&s;ters are erected

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Whether the property of goods &s;old be
transferred to the purcha&s;er by delive|ry,
though the price be not paid.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Roman law, delivery of the thing &s;old
pre&s;umes not the vender's will to transfer
the property, but only to intitle him to demand
the price; &sect; 41. <HI>In&s;tit. De rerum divi&s;ione;
l.</HI> 19. <HI>ff. De contrahenda emptione.</HI> And Vin|nius,
in his commentary on the In&s;titutes, men|tions
it to be the opinion of the doctors, that
delivery without receiving the price, will not in|fer
an intention in the vender to transfer the pro|perty,
unle&s;s evidence be given, that he was
willing to tru&s;t the purcha&s;er.</P>
<P>Is this doctrine adopted in our practice? Let
the reader judge for him&s;elf. And, fir&s;t, with
re&s;pect to heritable &s;ubjects, where delivery is
made by an in&s;trument of fei&s;in, the in&s;trument
infers transference of the property; it being a
rule in our law, That infeftment cannot be qua|lified
by any pre&s;umption, nor with any condition
or provi&s;ion, but what appears on the face of the
deed.</P>
<P>Next, as to moveables. An agreement to de|lay
payment of the price to a future time, mu&s;t
<PB N="57" REF="70">
be intended for the benefit of the purcha&s;er: but
it would be no benefit, if the u&s;e of the &s;ubject
were in the interim with-held from him. There|fore,
where payment is agreed to be delayed, de|livery
mu&s;t infer a transference of the property.</P>
<P>Where there is no paction to delay payment,
what if the vender, after delivery, forbear to de|mand
the price for a con&s;iderable time? Such
delay implies, that he was willing to tru&s;t the
price till he &s;hould have occa&s;ion for it; which,
according to what is now &s;aid, infers, that he in|tended
to transfer the property upon delivery.</P>
<P>Where the goods purcha&s;ed are intended for
immediate u&s;e, as corn for &s;eed, delivery can
have no other meaning, but to transfer the pro|perty;
for the vender cannot mean to retain the
property of a &s;ubject that is immediately to be an|nihilated.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall be &s;aid of a &s;ale with delivery,
where the &s;ubject is not intended for immediate
u&s;e, nor a paction for delay of payment. Can
the vender return next day, or next hour, to de|mand
the &s;ubject as his property, if the price be
not in&s;tantly offered? It is natural for the vend|er
to &s;ay on delivery, whether he be willing to
delay payment. Therefore, if he be &s;ilent about
what is his own concern, is it not the more natural
con&s;truction, that he is willing to transfer the
property, and to delay payment of the price till
<PB N="58" REF="71">
he have u&s;e for it? This &s;eems to be the proper
con&s;truction, even at common law.</P>
<P>But were it a rule at common law, as Vinnius
holds, that delivery, without receiving the price,
will not of it&s;elf infer an intention to transfer the
property; yet that rule cannot be admitted in a|ny
commercial nation, becau&s;e it would be a
great ob&s;truction to the commerce of moveables.
Suppo&s;e a moveable had pa&s;&s;ed through a hun|dred
hands, by buying and &s;elling, yet the la&s;t
purcha&s;er would lie open to have the &s;ubject ta|ken
from him, if any antecedent purcha&s;er, with|out
being tru&s;ted, had failed to pay the price.
Nor is it any hard&s;hip upon the vender that deli|very
&s;hould infer a transference of the property;
for if he be not willing to tru&s;t the price, let him
hold the &s;ubject till he obtain payment.</P>
<P>Attending to the foregoing rea&s;oning, Lord
Stair appears to be well founded in the following
propo&s;ition, laid down by him, tit. Sale, &sect; 2.
&startq;Sale being perfected, and the thing delivered,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Divi&s;ion of rent between the fiar and re|pre&s;entatives
of a liferenter, and be|tween
the heir and executors of a land|proprietor.</HEAD>
<P>REnts originally were paid in kind. A gra&s;s-farm
paid cattle, butter, chee&s;e: a corn-farm
paid wheat, barley, oats. A gra&s;s-farm
yields daily profit: the rent however is made
payable at Whit&s;unday and Martinmas; becau&s;e
more frequent payments would be trouble&s;ome to
the landlord as well as to the tenant. A corn-farm
yields no profit till the corns be reaped; and
therefore the rent, when paid in kind, cannot be
exacted before Martinmas.</P>
<P>When gold and &s;ilver came to be &s;o plentiful
as to enable a tenant to pay money-rent, it was
natural to &s;tipulate, that the rent of a corn-farm
&s;hould be paid at Whit&s;unday and Martinmas, as
the rent of a gra&s;s-farm had always been. And
thus, Whit&s;unday and Martinmas, coming to be
the ordinary terms of paying rent, were deno|minated
the <HI>legal terms.</HI> But as money-rent ad|mits
any terms of payment as parties can agree,
it came to be frequent in lea&s;es o &s;tipulate rent
<PB N="60" REF="73">
at the commencement of the lea&s;e, before the te|nant
could reap any profit, termed <HI>fore-hand
rent,</HI> and &s;ometimes long after the crop was
reaped, termed <HI>back-hand rent.</HI> And in oppo|&s;ition
to the legal terms, &s;uch terms of payment
obtained the name of <HI>conventional terms.</HI></P>
<P>Where a yearly annuity is paid to a liferenter,
or to any per&s;on, the annuitant is under&s;tood to
be intitled to a proportion daily for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence;
though, for the &s;ake of convenience, the &s;um be
made payable but once or twice a-year. There|fore,
at whatever time of the year the annuitant
dies, his repre&s;entatives have right to a part of
the annuity corre&s;ponding to the number of days
he lived. A liferenter of land is in a different
&s;tate. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is yielded to him; and he
acts in every re&s;pect as proprietor, granting lea|&s;es,
and &s;tipulating certain terms for paying the
rent. Every crop accordingly that ari&s;es during
his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, belongs to him, or to his tenant
who pays rent for it. The terms of payment of that
rent concern the liferenter and his tenant only: the
fiar has no right to any crop while the liferent &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts;
nor con&s;equently to the rent payable for &s;uch
crop. Hence, in &s;eparating the intere&s;t of the life|renter
from that of the fiar, the determining cir|cum&s;tance
is, for what crop any particular term's
rent is payable: if the crop come under the life|renter's
right, the rent due for it belongs to him,
<PB N="61" REF="74">
or to his executor, whatever be the term of pay|ment.
I de&s;cend to particulars. Where the rent
of a corn-farm is payable in kind, the liferenter
mu&s;t &s;urvive Martinmas, to give him right to the
rent payable for the preceding crop; and if he
decea&s;e before Martinmas, though after Whit&s;un|day,
he has no &s;hare of that year's rent. If the
rent be payable in money at two terms, the life|renter
&s;urviving Whit&s;unday has right to the half|year's
rent payable by the tenant for his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
from the Martinmas preceding. And if he
&s;urvive Martinmas, he has al&s;o right to the rent
for the tenant's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion from the Whit&s;unday
preceding. The conventional terms of payment
are not regarded, but for what crop the rent is
payable. See <HI>l.</HI> 58. <HI>De u&s;ufructu.</HI></P>
<P>It will appear even at fir&s;t view, that the divi|&s;ion
of rent between heir and executor ought not
to be governed by that rule. The liferenter
and fiar have oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, the property of
the latter being confined by that of the former.
The rent payable for any crop that falls under
the liferenter's right, mu&s;t, after his death, go to
his repre&s;entatives; for the fiar evidently has no
right. But as to heir and executor, both of them
are repre&s;entatives of the decea&s;ed proprietor;
and with re&s;pect to any crop that he &s;urvived,
his property cannot be pleaded for the executor
again&s;t the heir, more than for the heir again&s;t
the executor. By what rule, then, is this divi|&s;ion
<PB N="62" REF="75">
to be determined? The heir &s;ucceeds to the
land, and has right to whatever ari&s;es out of the
land from the time of his predece&s;&s;or's death.
The executor, who has no intere&s;t in the land,
has no claim to any rent but what fell due during
the predece&s;&s;or's life. Had that rent been paid
to the predece&s;&s;or, as it ought to have been, it
would have augmented the moveable e&s;tate;
and it is a rule in equity, That what ought to
have been done, be&s;tows the &s;ame right as
if it had been done: it will not be left in
the power of a tenant, to prefer the executor,
or the heir, by punctual or dilatory payment.
The rule then is, That no rents belong to the ex|ecutor
but what were in arrear during the prede|ce&s;&s;or's
life. Between liferenter and fiar the legal
terms are the rule: but the conventional terms,
between heir and executor.</P>
<P>The latter part of this rule &s;hall be illu&s;trated,
by applying it to a particular ca&s;e. A tenant en|tering
at Whit&s;unday 1758, agrees to pay a year's
rent per advance, being for the corn-crop 1759.
The landlord dies a few days after Whit&s;unday,
and the que&s;tion is, Whether the year's rent pay|able
at that term, goes to the heir or executor?
The heir has the plea of property, as the proper|ty
was his during the growth of crop 1759.
But the plea of property does not rule between
the heir and executor. The rent in que&s;tion was
an arrear at the landlord's death: had it been
<PB N="63" REF="76">
paid, it would have gone to the executor; and
what ought to have been done, is held in equity
as done. Were the plea of property to have a|ny
effect here, it would have a more exten&s;ive
effect than any lawyer will admit. It would
make the executor accountable to the heir for
the rent under con&s;ideration, &s;uppo&s;ing it even
to have been received by the predece&s;&s;or: it is
the rent of crop 1759, and that crop falls under
the heir's property, &amp;c. Take an oppo&s;ite ca&s;e.
The tenant enters to a corn-farm at Whit&s;unday
1758; and for the crop 1759 pays the rent at
Candlemas and Lammas 1760. The landlord
&s;urvives Martinmas 1759, but dies before Candle|mas
1760. He died, it is true, proprietor of the
crop 1759; but that circum&s;tance benefits not
the executor, who has no claim but to arrears.
And therefore the whole rent payable for crop 1759
belongs to the heir.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the divi&s;ion of rent between
the fiar and repre&s;entatives of a liferenter who is
a locali&s;t, the rule above laid down is adopted
in our practice. Far otherwi&s;e between the heir
and executor; for the rule that ju&s;tly obtains
between the former, is erroneou&s;ly applied be|tween
the latter. If the predece&s;&s;or &s;urvive
Whit&s;unday, his executor, by our pre&s;ent prac|tice,
has right to the half of the rent payable for
the crop of that year; and to the whole, if the
predece&s;&s;or &s;urvive Martinmas. This is to be re|gretted;
<PB N="64" REF="77">
becau&s;e, in&s;tead of a rule agreeable to
principles, and ea&s;y in the application, one is
&s;ub&s;tituted, not only erroneous, but intricate.</P>
<P>What it is that has betrayed our lawyers into
this error, may de&s;erve inquiry. One thing we
know, that formerly the rent was payable at
Whit&s;unday and Martinmas, each for the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of the half-year preceding. While this con|tinued
to be the cu&s;tom, the executors drew the
Whit&s;unday rent when the predece&s;&s;or &s;urvived
that term, and the whole year's rent when the
predece&s;&s;or &s;urvived Martinmas. And thus, as
the conventional and legal terms coincided, it
was the &s;ame to hold that the conventional terms
were the rule, or to hold that Whit&s;unday and
Martinmas were the rule. But mark the con&s;e|quence.
Had the propo&s;ition been expre&s;&s;ed
in the former manner, the conventional terms
would have continued to be the rule, as they
ought to be. But the latter expre&s;&s;ion happening
to be adopted, Whit&s;unday and Martinmas un|warily
continued to be the rule, after cea&s;ing to
be the conventional terms. And what mainly
contributed to the illu&s;ion, was the ca&s;e of life|renter
and fiar, where Whit&s;unday and Martinmas
are the ju&s;t rule, without regard to the conventional
terms. Thus, in contradi&s;tinction to the conven|tional
terms, Whit&s;unday and Martinmas are call|ed
<HI>legal terms,</HI> becau&s;e they are made the rule
<PB N="65" REF="78">
for dividing rents between heir and executor, as
well as between fiar and liferenter.</P>
<P>To intitle the executor to rents that were not
due at the death of the predece&s;&s;or, admits
&s;carcely of an excu&s;e, when it is con&s;idered, that
a lea&s;e of land is a proper example of a right
having <HI>tractum futuri temporis,</HI> which invaria|bly
de&s;cends to the heir; except with regard to
&s;uch portions as became due during the predece&s;|&s;or's
life.</P>
<P>But to whatever objections the rule may lie o|pen,
as regarding heir and executor, it is how|ever
adopted in practice, and mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted
to. I therefore proceed to illu&s;trate it by ex|amples.
In a corn-farm, the tenant enters at
Martinmas 1758, or at the &s;eparation of the crop
from the ground. The fir&s;t half of the year's
rent is made payable at Martinmas 1759, and
the other half at Whit&s;unday 1760, being both
for crop 1759. If the proprietor &s;urvive Whit|&s;unday
1759, the rent payable at Martinmas
1759 will make part of his moveable e&s;tate; and
if he &s;urvive Martinmas 1759, the rent payable
at Whit&s;unday 1760 will al&s;o make part. And
though payment of the rent be po&s;tponed to
Candlemas and Lammas 1760, or to any later
terms, the divi&s;ion is the &s;ame as if made pay|able
at Martinmas 1759 and Whit&s;unday 1760;
or even made payable at Whit&s;unday and Martin|mas
1759: for whatever the conventional terms
<PB N="66" REF="79">
be, the rents are payable for crop 1759. Sup|po&s;e
again a tenant, who enters to a corn-farm
at Martinmas 1758, is taken bound by the lea&s;e
to pay the fir&s;t half of his year's rent at Candle|mas
1759, and the other half at the following
Whit&s;undy. The&s;e rents being payable before|hand
for crop 1759, it follows from the common
rule, that if the landlord die before Whit&s;unday,
his executor will draw none of the rent for that
crop; not even the half payable at Candlemas
1759, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be out&s;tanding. Here the
common practice contradicts mo&s;t direcly the
rule of equity above mentioned, That what ought
to be done, is held as done. If the landlord &s;ur|vive
Candlemas, which is here &s;uppo&s;ed, the rent
payable at that term ought to be con&s;idered as
received by him, and as making part of his
moveable e&s;tate. Let it be next &s;uppo&s;ed in the
ca&s;e figured, that the landlord dies between
Whit&s;unday and Martinmas 1759, his executor,
by the rule in practice, would have no right to
the rent payable at Whit&s;unday, though due be|fore
the landlord's death, which is equally ab|&s;urd.</P>
<P>Where the tenant enters at Martinmas, the di|vi&s;ion
of rent between heir and executor will be
the &s;ame, whether it be a corn-farm or a gra&s;s|farm.
The fir&s;t half of the year's rent, at what|ever
time payable, is due for the tenant's po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
from his entry to the next Whit&s;unday; and
<PB N="67" REF="80">
con&s;equently it will belong to the executor, if the

where the tenant's entry is at Whit&s;unday; which
now prevails in corn-farms in order that the new
tenant may prepare for a crop of oats, by folding
his cattle, and for a crop of wheat, by a &s;ummer|fallow.
A tenant then enters to a corn-farm at
Whit&s;unday 1758, and is bound by his lea&s;e to
pay his rent at Canlemas and Lammas 1760.
The rent being for the crop 1759, belongs whol|ly
to the heir, if the predece&s;&s;or die before
Whit&s;unday 1759; divides between the heir and
executor, if the predece&s;&s;or die between Whit|&s;unday
and Martinmas 1759; and belongs whol|ly
to the executor, if the predece&s;&s;or die after
Martinmas 1759. But &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;ame entry
in a gra&s;s-farm, and the &s;ame terms of payment;
the rent will be under&s;tood as payable for the
year's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion from Whit&s;unday 1758 to Whit|&s;unday
1759; con&s;equently, if the landlord &s;ur|vive

the whole year's rent was for the &s;ummer's po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,

<P>A Man by granting a lea&s;e of land, does not

a purcha&s;er for a valuable con&s;ideration. The te|nant,
it is true, has by paction right to what re|mains
of the crop, after making good the land|lord's
rent; but till that be done, he has not
right to a &s;ingle &s;heaf. This <HI>rei vindicatio,</HI> found|ed
evidently on the landlord being proprietor of
the corn, is erroneou&s;ly con&s;idered as a hypothec
upon the effects of his tenant.</P>
<P>The crop being the landlord's property, and
continuing to be his property till he draw his
rent out of it, it is evident, that he is not intitled
to draw the rent of one crop out of any other
crop. To obtain preference for the rent of any
crop upon any &s;ub&s;equent crop, the landlord
mu&s;t do diligence; and he will not be preferred
<PB N="71" REF="84">
before any other creditor, but according to his
diligence.</P>
<P>Plenty of money has introduced money-rent;
which implies a transference of the crop from the
landlord to his tenant. A landlord who&s;e rent is
payable in money, has no claim to any part of
the product: on the contrary, the product mu&s;t
be at the di&s;po&s;al of the tenant, in order to rai&s;e
money for paying the rent. And therefore, the
&s;ecurity which the landlord has for his money|rent,
cannot be other than a hypothec in a pro|per
&s;en&s;e. If it be demanded, upon what authori|ty
is this hypothec founded, I an&s;wer, upon con|&s;uetude.
And it is not difficult to explain what
gave a beginning to the con&s;uetude. Our fore|fathers,
far from being &s;harp-&s;ighted in law-di&s;|tinctions,
did not advert to the con&s;equences of
converting corn-rent into money. A real action,
at the in&s;tance of the landlord again&s;t a purcha&s;er
of the crop, was familiar in the ca&s;e of corn-rent;
and the &s;ame action was blindly &s;u&s;tained for &s;up|porting
the claim of money-rent, though the crop
was no longer the landlord's property. It is far
however from my intention to condemn this hy|pothec,
though introduced by a blunder. It is
expedient and proper, that &s;ecurity &s;hould be
provided to the landlord upon the product of
his own land, for making his money-rent effec|tual.</P>
<P>While rents were payable in kind, there could
<PB N="72" REF="85">
be no occa&s;ion for hypothecating the cattle of a
corn-farm. But when money came to be &s;tipu|lated
for rent in&s;tead of corn, it was natural to
&s;ecure the payment by a hypothec on the cattle
as well as on the corn.</P>
<P>Cattle pa&s;turing on a farm are not more con|nected
with the rent of one year, than with that
of another; and for that rea&s;on they remain &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively
hypothecated for the rent of every year.
But though the hypothec on corn, with re&s;pect
to money-rent, be preci&s;ely of the &s;ame nature
with that on cattle, yet it is &s;u&s;tained for the rent
only of that preci&s;e year of which it is the pro|duct.
It was &s;o originally when rent was pay|able
in kind; and our forefathers have inadvert|ently
apply'd the &s;ame rule to the hypothec of
corn for money-rent, though in its nature very
different. After the rent for crop 1759 becomes
due, there happen to be in the yard &s;ome corns
of the preceding crop: the landlord cannot claim
the&s;e as hypothecated for the rent 1759. This
rule proves extremely inconvenient both in fore|hand
rent, and in rent payable long after &s;epara|tion
of the crop from the ground. In the for|mer,
it is of little or no u&s;e to the landlord; and
in the latter, it is oppre&s;&s;ive to the tenant, and
&s;ometimes highly oppre&s;&s;ive. The fir&s;t example
I &s;hall give is, where the tenant entering at Mar|tinmas
1758, pays at his entry a year's rent for
his expected po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of crop 1759. Every
<PB N="73" REF="86">
year's rent being thus payable a complete year
beforehand, the landlord cannot u&s;e his hypo|thec
for a year after his rent becomes due. This
however is but a trifling inconvenience, compa|red
with what the tenant &s;uffers where the terms
of payment are late. The example I &s;hall give is
common. A tenant enters to a corn-farm at
Whit&s;unday 1758; and for the crop 1759 he pays
the rent at Candlemas and Lammas 1760. If
the crop 1759 be hypothecated for that rent only,
$t follows, that at Candlemas 1760, the tenant
mu&s;t have as much of the crop on hand as to &s;a|$isfy
a year's rent; and as much even at Lam|mas
as to &s;atisfy half a year's rent. A hard&s;hip
more intolerable cannot well be figured: it is by
the &s;ale of corn that the tenant procures money
for paying his rent; and yet the hypothec &s;o in|terpreted,
in&s;tead of promoting payment, is the
very thing that retards it. Con&s;ider the thing in
a different view. Late terms of payment are in|tended
to favour the tenant, that he may have
full time to procure money for paying his rent;
and yet, according to the effect given to the hy|pothec,
he gets not a moment's delay; or, which
comes to the &s;ame, he has no benefit by the de|lay.</P>
<P>I would not however be under&s;tood to plead
for a hypothec on corn, equally permanent with
that on cattle. After the year's rent becomes
due, the landlord has three months for making
<PB N="74" REF="87">
the hypothec upon the cattle effectual<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">January 1726, Hepburn <HI>contra</HI> Richard&s;on.</NOTE>; and af|ter
that year's rent is &s;atisfied, the hypothec up|on
the cattle commences for the next year's rent.
Nor is there any inconvenience in the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
hypothecs; becau&s;e the &s;ame hor&s;es, horned
cattle, and even &s;heep, continue upon the land
for years. A corn-crop is in a very different
condition. It &s;uffers by keeping; and, re&s;erving
what is &s;ufficient for maintaining the family, the
only u&s;e of the remainder is to convert it into
money for paying the rent. And yet, to hypo|thecate
the &s;ame corn &s;ucce&s;&s;ively for the rent of
different years, would be pernicious equally to
the landlord and to his tenant, by preventing the
latter from paying any rent. Nor is a &s;ecurity
&s;o heteroclete nece&s;&s;ary in any degree. Crops of
corn are renewed every year; and with re&s;pect
to any &s;ingle crop, it is &s;ufficient that it be hypo|thecated
for the rent of a &s;ingle year; a new
crop will &s;ucceed, to be a &s;ecurity for the next
year's rent. And if corn is to be hypothecated
for a &s;ingle year's rent only, it ought to be the
half-year's rent that is current when the corns are
reaped, and the half-year's rent immediately pre|ceding.
By that plan, the hypothec is as little
oppre&s;&s;ive as po&s;&s;ible to the tenant; and no le&s;s
beneficial to the landlord, than if any other year's
rent were &s;ecured by it.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="88">
The hypothec under con&s;ideration, whether
affecting corn or cattle, is, in its nature, &s;o &s;in|gular,
as to create a doubt, whether &s;uch a legal
conception of it can be formed, as to account
for all its avowed con&s;equences. It is admitted,
that a hypothec upon the cattle, bars not the te|nant
from aliening any particular hor&s;e, ox, or
&s;heep, or even quantities of them; provided &s;uf|ficiency
be left for the hypothec. It follows clear|ly,
that no individual is hypothecated; and yet,
upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, it is difficult to conceive
that the whole flock or herd can be hypothecated.
To avoid that difficulty, one is led to think, that
there is no hypothec here in a proper &s;en&s;e; but
only a preference given to the landlord before the
tenant's other creditors, not as having any real
right, but upon equitable con&s;iderations; a pre|ference
<HI>inter chirographarios,</HI> as termed in the
Roman law. But in avoiding <HI>Scylla,</HI> we are
driven upon <HI>Charibdis.</HI> If the hypothec be re|duced
to a preference <HI>inter chirographarios,</HI> it
cannot affect <HI>bona fide</HI> purcha&s;ers for a valuable
con&s;ideration; which however it does by e&s;ta|bli&s;hed

<P>THE nature and import of a clau&s;e of return,
&s;eem not to be clearly apprehended.</P>
<P>During the vigour of the Feudal law, every
grant of land was limited to the va&s;&s;al, and to the
heirs named in the grant. When the&s;e were ex|hau&s;ted,
the land returned to the &s;uperior.</P>
<P>The feudal &s;y&s;tem was undermined by degrees,
and land was re&s;tored to commerce. The forms
however of that &s;y&s;tem continued in practice, be|cau&s;e
no other forms were known for conveying
the property of land. And hence a blanch hold|ing,
which has no relation to the feudal &s;y&s;tem,
but form merely. The purcha&s;er, though no|minally
a va&s;&s;al, is ab&s;olute proprietor; and in
that quality tran&s;mits the land to his heirs of line,
failing the heirs named in the grant. And even
where the nominal va&s;&s;al leaves no heirs, the
&s;ubject returns not to the &s;uperior, but belongs to
the King, as <HI>ultimus haeres.</HI></P>
<P>As this alteration in the feudal &s;y&s;tem was
not in&s;tantaneous, there mu&s;t have been a pe|riod,
when &s;ome lands were governed by the Feu|dal
law, and others by common law, excepting
<PB N="79" REF="92">
always the form of the title-deeds. The former
were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>feuda vetera,</HI>
the latter by that of <HI>feuda nova.</HI></P>
<P>During that period, where a proper feudal
grant was intended, con&s;ining the grant to the
heirs named in the inve&s;titure, a proper clau&s;e
to that effect became nece&s;&s;ary; otherwi&s;e it
mu&s;t have been uncertain whether a <HI>feudum ve|tus</HI>
or <HI>novum</HI> was intended. The clau&s;e was
termed a <HI>Clau&s;e of Return,</HI> bearing, that when
the heirs of the inve&s;titure were exhau&s;ted, the
land &s;hould return to the &s;uperior. And hence
it came to be under&s;tood, that a grant with|out
that clau&s;e was intended to be a <HI>feudum no|vum.</HI></P>
<P>This clau&s;e is imitated in deeds that have no
relation to the &s;eudal holding; &s;ignifying the
granter's intention, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hall not
be altered to his prejudice, but that the &s;ubject
&s;hall return to him when the heirs named are ex|hau&s;ted.
Our judges accordingly give that &s;en&s;e
to the clau&s;e, in the following ca&s;e. A bond for
borrowed money was taken by the lender to her|&s;elf
in liferent, and to her &s;on in fee, with the
following provi&s;ion, &startq;That if her &s;on die with|out
heirs of his body, the &s;um &s;hall return to
her, and her heirs.&endq; This clau&s;e was found to
imply, that the &s;on could not alien gratuitou&s;ly;

In the deci&s;ions of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, differ|ent
effects are given to the&s;e clau&s;es of return
contained in bonds. Sometimes, they are held
equivalent to a clau&s;e of return in a feudal hold|ing,
barring both extraneous heirs and gratui|tous
a&s;&s;ignees. Sometimes, they are held to be
no better than a &s;imple de&s;tination of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.
As que&s;tions of will are influenced frequently e|ven
by minute circum&s;tances, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing
to find little uniformity in the deci&s;ions of the
court with relation to clau&s;es of return. The
neare&s;t approach to uniformity that occurs, is to
di&s;tingui&s;h a clau&s;e of return that a man pro|vides
in his own favour, from a clau&s;e of return
in favour of another. It is rational to give the
mo&s;t liberal interpretation to the former, and the
mo&s;t limited interpretation to the latter. A clau&s;e
accordingly of the former &s;ort, will bar both ex|traneous
heirs, and gratuitous a&s;&s;ignees. A clau&s;e
of the latter &s;ort will be con&s;tructed a &s;imple de|&s;tination
of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I proceed to examples. In the ca&s;e above quo|ted,
College of Edinburgh <HI>contra</HI> Mortimer,
the borrower was indeed the granter of the
bond; but the de&s;tination of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and clau&s;e

with which the debtor had no concern. And as
the clau&s;e of return was in favour of the credi|tor,
the court gave it the mo&s;t liberal meaning.

only the &s;ilver-duty. But where the titularities
are different, the par&s;onage-teind is but the fifth
of the rent payable for the corn-crop. The&s;e
rules &s;eem not con&s;i&s;tent with each other. How|ever
the vicarage be computed, the value of the
par&s;onage-teind can never ju&s;tly exceed the fifth of
the rent payable for the corn-crop. Nor is this
the only puzzling circum&s;tance. Suppo&s;e both
par&s;onage and vicarage teind to belong to the
&s;ame titular; his aliening the vicarage-teind, can|not
alter the value of the par&s;onage-teind; and
yet the heritor gains by this alienation; for now
he is allowed to value his par&s;onage-teind at no
more than a fifth of the rent payable for the corn-crop.
Suppo&s;e next, the titularities being o|riginally
different, the titular of the par&s;onage|teind
acquires right to the vicarage. Why
&s;hould this oblige the heritor to purcha&s;e the
par&s;onage-teind at a higher rate than when
the titularities were different? The fifth of
the rent payable for the corn-crop, ought in every
ca&s;e to be held the value of the par&s;onage-teind.</P>

<P>IT is agreeable to the principles of ju&s;tice, that
a man's effects, after his death, &s;hould go to
his children: who, on the other hand, ought to
pay his debts to the extent of the effects. And
yet, by adopting a fiction of the Roman law, That
the heir is <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum defuncto,</HI> we have
unwarily deviated far from ju&s;tice, particularly in
&s;ubjecting the heir univer&s;ally to the predece&s;&s;or's
debts, without the lea&s;t regard to the extent of
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; which continues to be our law to
this day, unle&s;s the heir enter <HI>cum beneficio in|ventarii.</HI>
This &s;ubject is di&s;cu&s;&s;ed at large in
Hi&s;torical Law-Tracts, tract 13.</P>
<P>Laying regard to ju&s;tice a&s;ide, identity of per|&s;on
may have a colour in &s;ubjects of property,
and in obligations that can be performed by one
per&s;on or another indifferently. But as the heir is
in reality a different per&s;on from his predece&s;&s;or,
there are certain things purely per&s;onal that he
cannot &s;ucceed to, and other things equally per|&s;onal
that he cannot be liable to perform. An
attempt to regulate &s;uch matters by per&s;onal iden|$ity,
would not only be unju&s;t, but ab&s;urd.
<PB N="85" REF="98">
The&s;e I propo&s;e to handle in the pre&s;ent Article.
I begin with the fir&s;t; which is, to examine how
far the active repre&s;entation of an heir extends.</P>
<P>Grotius lays down the following rule, &startq;Heres
per&s;onam defuncti refert, non in meritis quae
&s;unt mere per&s;onalia, &s;ed in bonis<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De jure belli et pacis, lib. 2. cap. 29. &sect; 19.</NOTE>.&endq; This
rule is ob&s;cure; but it may be cleared as follows.
Every thing that can be transferred from one to
another, is &s;aid to be <HI>in bonis;</HI> and to &s;uch the
heir &s;ucceeds. But there are certain things which
cannot be transferred from one to another, and
are extingui&s;hed with the per&s;on who has them:
the&s;e are purely per&s;onal, and are not capable of
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. A man's knowledge, his &s;trength,
and his qualities in general, are buried in the
grave with him. Reparation is due to the man
only who is injured: not to his heir. And even
where money is the only reparation that can be
made, termed <HI>a&s;&s;ythment,</HI> the claim, being due
<HI>in $olatium</HI> to the per&s;on injured, de&s;cends not
to the heir; unle&s;s a decree have been obtained for
it by the man him&s;elf; for by that decree, it is con|verted
into a proper debt. But where the prede|ce&s;&s;or
is intitled to damages again&s;t a per&s;on who
has burnt his hou&s;e, or killed his hor&s;e, the claim
being founded on property, de&s;cends to the heir,
as the &s;ubject would have done had it not been
de&s;troyed. And where his predece&s;&s;or has been
<PB N="86" REF="99">
wounded, he is intitled to &s;ue for the expence laid
out on the cure; becau&s;e &s;o far the &s;ubject to
which he &s;ucceeds is dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>A title of honour cannot be cla&s;&s;ed under <HI>bona</HI>
or effects; and yet, it is not an objection to the
foregoing doctrine, that the heir &s;ucceeds to the
peerage of his predece&s;&s;or. A peerage is a right
purely per&s;onal, and dies with the per&s;on who
bears it. The heir a&s;&s;umes it in his own right,
being intitled by the patent, not as repre&s;enting
his predece&s;&s;or. It is accordingly e&s;tabli&s;hed,
that the bearing a title of honour belonging to a
family, is not a pa&s;&s;ive title &s;ubjecting the heir to
the debts of his predece&s;&s;or<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Harcar&s;e (Airs), 2d February 1682, Bowar <HI>contra</HI> Earl Mari&s;chal.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>All &s;ubjects, moveable and immoveable, de|&s;cend
to repre&s;entatives. In no civilized country
are &s;ubjects left <HI>in medio</HI> without an owner; and
the heir is the per&s;on who naturally &s;ucceeds to
what is left by his predece&s;&s;or. But there are
certain powers and faculties re&s;pecting &s;ubjects of
inheritance, &s;ome of which de&s;cend to the heir,
&s;ome not; and it &s;eems not an ea&s;y ta&s;k to bring
the&s;e under any general rule. Some faculties are
created by law upon con&s;iderations purely per&s;o|nal.
For the peace of families, and to prevent a
married couple from robbing one another by un|due
influence, the law has be&s;towed both on hu&s;|band
and wife, a power of revoking donations
<PB N="87" REF="100">
made by the one to the other. But as the mo|tive
here is purely per&s;onal, the power of revoca|tion
de&s;cends not to the heir. The act 1669, re|quiring
con&s;ignation in ca&s;e of &s;u&s;pending a mini|&s;ter's
&s;tipend, is privilege per&s;onal to the mini|&s;ter;
nor is there any rea&s;on for extending it to
his executors.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to faculties created by will, though
heirs are excluded at common law if not provi|ded
for in the deed, yet in equity the heir &s;uc|ceeds
where ju&s;tice or utility interpo&s;es in his be|half.
A power of demanding back land aliened,
termed <HI>a rever&s;ion,</HI> will not de&s;cend to heirs, if
not named in the deed; for a perpetual rever&s;ion
is a burden upon property too &s;evere to be pre&s;u|med,
where heirs are not mentioned. But &s;up|po&s;e,
that a di&s;poner &s;tipulates to him&s;elf a re|ver&s;ion
during a limited time, ten years for ex|ample,
and dies during that period; will his
heir be privileged to redeem within the ten
years? At common law he is not privileged.
But equity &s;ugge&s;ts the following di&s;tinction:
Where the di&s;po&s;ition is gratuitous, it will be pre|&s;umed
the will of parties, that the land may be
redeemed at any time within ten years by the
di&s;poner, and failing him, by his heir: but there
is not the &s;ame pre&s;umption where the land is
di&s;poned for a full price.</P>
<P>Whether obligations created by will go to re|pre&s;entatives
where not named in the deed, mu&s;t
<PB N="88" REF="101">
be ruled by equity. An obligation for a valuable
con&s;ideration, goes to repre&s;entatives, unle&s;s they
be expre&s;sly excluded: a gratuitous obligation
goes not to repre&s;entatives, unle&s;s they be ex|pre&s;sly
included<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Principles of Equity, book 3. ch. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Next as to pa&s;&s;ive repre&s;entation. There are
obligations, purely per&s;onal, that the heir is not
bound to fulfil, as there are rights, purely per|&s;onal,
that de&s;cend not to him. No obligation
that requires art or talents to fulfil, burdens the
heir. My predece&s;&s;or became bound to draw a
picture for a man, to build a hou&s;e for him, or to
&s;erve him as a &s;oldier: I am not bound.</P>
<P>Puni&s;hment is purely per&s;onal; for to inflict it
upon any but the guilty, would not an&s;wer its
end. Therefore if my predece&s;&s;or have commit|ted
a crime, I am not bound to &s;ubmit to the pu|ni&s;hment.
An heir is not liable even for a pecu|niary
penalty; unle&s;s it have been converted by
a decree into an ordinary debt. The penal pa&s;|&s;ive
title accordingly of vicious intromi&s;&s;ion, is
not extended again&s;t heirs beyond the value of
the &s;ubjects unlawfully taken away<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dirleton, 14th July 1666, Cran&s;ton <HI>contra</HI> Wilki|&s;on; Dirleton, 14th December 1676, Wallace <HI>contra</HI> Murray.</NOTE>. In the
Roman law, liti&s;conte&s;tation with the predece&s;&s;or,
&s;ubjects the heir to every penal action. The rea|&s;on
is, that liti&s;conte&s;tation was originally a con|tract,
<PB N="89" REF="102">
in which the litigants bound their heirs,
as well as them&s;elves<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 9.</NOTE>; and the heir was bound
by his predece&s;&s;or's contract, not for his delict.
This rule was pre&s;erved alive among the Romans,
by force of cu&s;tom, after juri&s;diction was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
upon authority of law, and liti&s;conte&s;ta|tion
cea&s;ed to be a contract; which is one ex|ample
among many, of effects being &s;upported in
practice, after their cau&s;es are gone. But how|ever
excu&s;able an error may be that is &s;anctified
by long cu&s;tom, our lawyers cannot be excu&s;ed
for adopting the foregoing rule from the Roman
law; &s;eeing that liti&s;conte&s;tation never was held
with us to be a contract<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the &s;ame tract.</NOTE>. And if the heir be
bound to &s;u&s;tain a penal action liti&s;conte&s;tated
with his predece&s;&s;or, he is made liable for his
predece&s;&s;or's delict; which cannot be ju&s;tified,
as puni&s;hment is &s;trictly per&s;onal. Strange! that
this &s;hould have been overlooked by our writers
on law; who, all of them, without a &s;ingle excep|tion,
adhere to the Roman rule. And no le&s;s
&s;trange, that it &s;hould be overlooked by our
judges, who currently &s;ubject the heir to every
penal action that has been liti&s;conte&s;tated with
the predece&s;&s;or. Thus, an extracted act of li|ti&s;conte&s;tation,
and a proof of vicious intromi&s;|&s;ion
taken again&s;t the intromitter him&s;elf, were
found &s;ufficient to make his repre&s;entatives liable
<PB N="90" REF="103">
<HI>in &s;olidum</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple, 5th June 1717, Forbes of Thornton <HI>contra</HI> Forbes of Tolquhoun.</NOTE>; though to &s;ubject them beyond
the value of the &s;ubject intermeddled with, was
obviou&s;ly to puni&s;h them for their predece&s;&s;or's
delict. It de&s;erves, at the &s;ame time, to be ob|&s;erved,
how prone men are to revolt again&s;t e|&s;tabli&s;hed
rules that are not founded on ju&s;t prin|ciples.
Our judges are always di&s;po&s;ed to lay
hold of any pretext, for evading the inju&s;tice of
the rule under con&s;ideration. Thus, a proce&s;s
on the pa&s;&s;ive title of vicious intromi&s;&s;ion being
in&s;i&s;ted on again&s;t the intromitter, who decea&s;ed
after an act of liti&s;conte&s;tation was pronounced by
the Ordinary, the court refu&s;ed to transfer the
&s;ame again&s;t his heir; partly becau&s;e the act was
not extracted, and partly becau&s;e, after the inter|locutor,
the pur&s;uer was obliged to amend his li|bel,
by changing one Chri&s;tian name for another<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Forbes, 7.; Fountainhall, 8th February 1712, Stewart <HI>contra</HI> Earl of Bute.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A rule is laid down above, concerning what
obligations go to heirs, when they are not men|tioned
in the deed. What obligations go again&s;t
heirs, is a que&s;tion to which the &s;ame rule is ap|plicable.
A gratuitous obligation will not &s;ubject
the heir, unle&s;s he be &s;ubjected in the deed.
Thus, a bond of pen&s;ion granted to an advocate,
was judged to die with the granter, &s;eeing no
<PB N="91" REF="104">
mention was made of his heirs<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 25th January 1693, Mackenzie <HI>con|tra</HI> Marquis of Montro&s;e.</NOTE>. The contrary
holds in obligations for a valuable con&s;ideration:
the heir is liable, unle&s;s it be declared that he
&s;hall not be liable. Thus, a bond for borrowed
money burdens the heir, though he be not men|tioned
in the bond. It is pre&s;umed, that he was
omitted by over&s;ight; and equity &s;upplies the o|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>TO transfer property <HI>inter vivos,</HI> delivery is
nece&s;&s;ary as well as con&s;ent. But to tran&s;|fer
it from the dead to the living, delivery is not
nece&s;&s;ary: nor can it be; for after the proprie|tor's
death, there exi&s;ts no per&s;on who can make
delivery. Will alone is &s;ufficient; and were it
not &s;ufficient, property could not be transferred
from the dead to the living. Thus, the ef|fects
of the predece&s;&s;or are, upon his death, tran&s;|ferred
<HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> to his heir; which is &s;ignified in
the law of France and of England by the expre&s;|&s;ion,
<HI>Mortuus &s;$&s;it vivum.</HI></P>
<P>But this rule cannot hold where the heir is &s;ub|jected
to debts or burdens; for it would be in|con&s;i&s;tent
with ju&s;tice, that a man, free and in|dependent
by nature, &s;hould be &s;ubjected to any
obligation, or to any burden, without his own con|&s;ent.
In the Roman law, where the heir is held
to be <HI>eadem per&s;ona cum defuncto</HI> in burdens as
well as benefits, the heritage was not transferred
to him <HI>&s;ola &s;uperviventia,</HI> but needed an ante|cedent
con&s;ent. The con&s;ent indeed required no
&s;olemnity: the apprehending po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
predece&s;&s;or's effects, termed <HI>ge&s;tio pro herede,</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="106">
was held a &s;ufficient declaration of con&s;ent. In
France and in England there are no remain|ing
traces of the Feudal law. The heir, by
taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, does not &s;ubject him&s;elf per&s;o|nally
to the debts or deeds of his predece&s;&s;or:
no more is incumbent on him, but to abandon
his predece&s;&s;or's e&s;tate to the creditors; and
therefore, in the countries mentioned, <HI>Mortuus
&s;a&s;it vivum</HI> is the rule even in land-property.</P>
<P>In Scotland, this rule obtains not in the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
even of moveables. As every &s;pecies of
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion with us &s;ubjects the heir to his ance|&s;tor's
debts, <HI>aditio hereditatis</HI> is requi&s;ite, as a|mong
the Romans, to te&s;tify the heir's con&s;ent
to be liable. But the rule obtains here in every
ca&s;e where property is transferred without any
debt or burden. Thus, the legacy of a <HI>corpus</HI>
transfers the property to the legatee, the moment
of the te&s;tator's death<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">l. 80. De legat. 2.; l. 64. De furtis; Stair, b. 3. tit. 4. &sect; 24. b. 3. tit. 8. &sect; 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are two &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons, that prevent
the rule from taking place with us in feudal pro|perty.
The fir&s;t coincides with that above men|tioned:
an heir who &s;ucceeds to a land-e&s;tate
is liable to his &s;uperior in certain duties, and is,
over and above, liable for the debts of his pre|dece&s;&s;or;
neither of which burdens can be ju&s;t|ly
impo&s;ed on him without his con&s;ent. The o|ther
rea&s;on is, that &s;uppo&s;ing the heir willing to
<PB N="94" REF="107">
undergo every burden, yet &s;uch is the nature of
&s;eudal property in Scotland, as not to be transfer|able
from the dead to the living, more than <HI>in|ter
vivos,</HI> without delivery: a &s;ei&s;in is equally
nece&s;&s;ary in both. In England the rule <HI>Mortuus
&s;a&s;it vivum</HI> obtains in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of land as
well as of moveables; becau&s;e both pa&s;s from
the dead to the living without delivery. Hence
it was an ea&s;y &s;tep in that kingdom to authori&s;e
the conveyance of land by te&s;tament, as move|ables
always had done. But as to land in Scot|land
a te&s;tament can avail nothing; becau&s;e it
neither expre&s;&s;es nor implies an obligation on the
heir to make the defunct's will effectual: nor is
it any ground for an adjudication in implement.
In&s;tead of a te&s;tament, a di&s;po&s;ition is nece&s;&s;ary,
with procuratory or precept; or at lea&s;t an obli|gation
to grant a di&s;po&s;ition, which may be made
effectual by an adjudication in implement. Were
a te&s;tamentary deed held &s;ufficient in this country
to transfer land, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to new|mould
our records, by rendering &s;uch deeds of
no effect unle&s;s recorded.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars premi&s;ed, we proceed to the
nature and u&s;e of the &s;pecial and general &s;ervi|ces,
beginning with the former. It is ob&s;erved
above, that the heir in a feudal holding, acquires
the property by a grant from the &s;uperior, term|ed
<HI>renovatio &s;eudi.</HI> The &s;overeign here acts
<PB N="95" REF="108">
differently from a &s;ubject-&s;uperior. The latter is
&s;uppo&s;ed to be acquainted with the condition of
his va&s;&s;als: and upon application of the heir, he
i&s;&s;ues a precept for infefting the heir, or, in other
words, for entering him into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. No
proof is nece&s;&s;ary to verify the heir's claim, be|cau&s;e
the facts are known to the &s;uperior; and
the precept accordingly is introduced with the
following preamble, <HI>Quia mihi clare con&s;tat.</HI>
In order to receive a renovation of the feu from
the &s;overeign, greater ceremony is nece&s;&s;ary.
The King is not &s;uppo&s;ed to be acquainted with
every one of his numerous va&s;&s;als; and therefore
it is made a general rule, That the per&s;on who
claims as heir, mu&s;t verify the facts that are ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to &s;upport his claim; which is done in the
following manner. A brieve is i&s;&s;ued from the
chancery to the &s;heriff of the &s;hire where the land
lies, requiring him to try, by an inque&s;t, the
facts &s;pecified in the brieve. If the facts be ve|rified,
the &s;heriff of old gave infe&s;tment to the
claimant; and the verdict of the inque&s;t remain|ed
in the &s;heriff's court, or was neglected as no
longer of u&s;e. This form was altered by James I.
in conformity to the practice of England. The
brieve, with a minute of the court's proceedings
and verdict of the inque&s;t, are returned to the
chancery; and the claim being thus legally &s;up|ported,
a precept i&s;&s;ues out of chancery to the
&s;heriff, ordering him to infeft the claimant. The
<PB N="96" REF="109">
verdict of the inque&s;t is termed a <HI>&s;ervice,</HI> which,
in England, expre&s;&s;es what is done in obedience
to a writ. And with us afterward it was called a
<HI>&s;pecial &s;ervice,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to a general &s;ervice
when that writ was introduced. The proce&s;s in
the &s;heriff's court, after the practice was intro|duced
of returning it to the chancery, obtained
from that circum&s;tance the name of <HI>retornatus,</HI>
or retour.</P>
<P>One can be at no lo&s;s, after this deduction,
to comprehend the meaning and purpo&s;e of a
&s;pecial &s;ervice. The inque&s;t are the witne&s;&s;es
called to give evidence of the nece&s;&s;ary facts;
the verdict is the evidence they give; and the
whole proceedings are returned to the chancery,
as an an&s;wer to the que&s;tions of fact put in behalf
of the crown.</P>
<P>To explain a general &s;ervice, a wider compa&s;s
is requi&s;ite. In Scotland of old, the heir was
not liable per&s;onally for the debts of his ance&s;tor;
nor is he even at pre&s;ent liable in England.
Therefore, as to rent-charges, bonds &s;ecluding
executors, and other heritable &s;ubjects, that may
be termed allodial becau&s;e not held of a &s;upe|rior,
the&s;e in Scotland, as in England, were <HI>ip|&s;o
facto</HI> transferred to the heir of blood, upon
the death of his ance&s;tor. Heirs with us were
put on a different footing, by adopting identity
of per&s;on from the Roman law. The heir, be|ing
by that fiction &s;ubjected per&s;onally to the
<PB N="97" REF="110">
debts of his ance&s;tor, mu&s;t con&s;equently have an
option to claim the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or to abandon it,
as it &s;uits his intere&s;t. And hence an <HI>aditio he|reditatis,</HI>
as among the Romans, without which
the heir has no right to his ance&s;tor's effects.
If he u&s;e this form, he becomes <HI>eadem per&s;ona
cum defuncto</HI> with re&s;pect to burdens as well as
benefits: if he ab&s;tain from u&s;ing it, he is un|der&s;tood
to abandon the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and to have
no concern either with burdens or benefits. The
form is &s;imple, adapted to the nature of the
tran&s;action. The laying hold of any allodial &s;ub|ject,
is held an <HI>aditio hereditatis,</HI> or <HI>ge&s;tio pro
herede;</HI> which, on the one hand, completes the
heir's right to all &s;ubjects of the kind, and, on
the other, makes him liable to all the debts of
his ance&s;tor. Thus, the taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
heir&s;hip-moveables, makes the heir <HI>eadem per&s;o|na
cum defuncto;</HI> and the &s;ame po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is the
only active title that is nece&s;&s;ary. In that re&s;pect,
the heir re&s;embles the next of kin after the
act 1690: a &s;ervice is not requi&s;ite to complete
the heir's right to heir&s;hip-moveables; and a
confirmation is not requi&s;ite to complete the
right of the next of kin to other moveables:
neither of them has right <HI>&s;ola &s;uperviventia;</HI>
and the taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is the <HI>aditio hereditatis</HI>
in both. A valuable manu&s;cript of great antiqui|ty,
is bequeathed to a family&punc; will it not be con|&s;idered
<PB N="98" REF="111">
as an heir&s;hip-moveable, to pa&s;s from the
ance&s;tor to the heir without a &s;ervice?</P>
<P>There is a &s;tronger analogy between heir&s;hip-moveables
and heritable bonds or heritable
di&s;po&s;itions, than is commonly thought. Con&s;i|dering
an heritable bond as a <HI>jus incorporale,</HI>
there is no analogy. But con&s;idering it as a ma|nu&s;cript,
why may it not be transferred from the
dead to the living, like any other heir&s;hip-move|able?
A general &s;ervice is not nece&s;&s;ary to
tran&s;mit heir&s;hip-moveables: an heritable bond,
or other deed affecting land, con&s;idered as a <HI>cor|pus,</HI>
is an heir&s;hip-moveable. For what purpo&s;e
then was a general &s;ervice introduced? Our au|thors
are &s;ilent upon that head; and we mu&s;t
grope our way in the dark. The general &s;ervice
is of no great antiquity: it followed the &s;pecial
&s;ervice at a great di&s;tance of time; and is an
aukward imitation of it. Every circum&s;tance
proves, that it mu&s;t have been introduced by ig|norant
practitioners, without authority of the le|gi&s;lature,
and probably without direction of the
&s;overeign court. In the fir&s;t place, there is no
brieve in the chancery for a general &s;ervice.
This defect could not regularly be &s;upplied but
by a &s;tatute. But preci&s;ion was little minded;
and it was thought, that the brieve for a &s;pecial
&s;ervice might an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, though the
whole clau&s;es in that brieve concern land in which
the predece&s;&s;or died infeft, and the&s;e only. In
<PB N="99" REF="112">
the next place, the verdict is no le&s;s irregular
than the brieve. One que&s;tion excepted, viz.
Whether did the predece&s;&s;or die at the faith and
peace of our Sovereign Lord, the verdict an|&s;wers
none of the que&s;tions put in the brieve;
but an&s;wers one that is not put, viz. Whether
the claimant be the heir of line? A minute is
made of the proceedings as is done in the &s;pecial
&s;ervice; and is returned to the chancery, though
the &s;overeign has no concern in the matter.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering that the general &s;ervice is a &s;ervile
imitation of the &s;pecial &s;ervice, we may conclude,
with rea&s;onable a&s;&s;urance, that to furni&s;h legal e|vidence
is the purpo&s;e of both. This is clear
in a &s;pecial &s;ervice, from its form, and from its
contents; and it is equally clear from the form
and contents of a general &s;ervice: the tenor of a
writ is the &s;tronge&s;t evidence of its purpo&s;e. But
now &s;uppo&s;ing this, the que&s;tion is, What is the
u&s;e of the general &s;ervice? An heir, in order to
continue his predece&s;&s;or's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heir|&s;hip-moveables,
has no occa&s;ion for any proof.
But heritable bonds are in a different condition.
An heir may take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them <HI>via facti.</HI>
But he cannot lay his hand upon the money <HI>via
facti:</HI> he mu&s;t apply to the debtors; who will
be &s;crupulous about paying till they have com|plete
evidence of his being heir. This con&s;idera|tion
unfolds the purpo&s;e of the general &s;ervice.
If in every proce&s;s again&s;t the debtors of the pre|dece&s;&s;or,
<PB N="100" REF="113">
it were incumbent on the pur&s;uer to re|new
the evidence of his being heir, the expence
would be grievous; and the general &s;ervice
was certainly invented to prevent that grievance.
A general &s;ervice accordingly may be con&s;idered
as a public proof, which every debtor is bound to
regard.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve an error gaining ground daily, as if
it were the &s;pecial &s;ervice that produces the iden|tity
of per&s;on between the heir and ance&s;tor. A
&s;pecial &s;ervice has no &s;uch effect; it being, as de|mon&s;trated
above, a &s;pecies merely of evidence.
Subject-&s;uperiors, acquainted with the condi|tion
of their va&s;&s;als, have no occa&s;ion for evi|dence;
and they accordingly give infeftment, by
means of a precept of <HI>Clare con&s;tat,</HI> without the
&s;olemnity of a &s;pecial &s;ervice. Nor does there
appear any thing in law to bar the King from
granting &s;uch a precept, where the nece&s;&s;ary facts
are known to him without a proof. It is pro|bable,
that he has often granted precepts of that
kind to the heirs of his chief va&s;&s;als; of which
there is one illu&s;trious in&s;tance on record. James
VI. granted a precept of <HI>Clare con&s;tat</HI> in favour
of his elde&s;t &s;on Prince Charles, as neare&s;t heir
to his mother Queen Anne in the lord&s;hip of
Dunfermline, directing the &s;heriff of Fife to give
&s;ei&s;in of the &s;aid lord&s;hip to the &s;aid Prince. To
this precept the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion interpo&s;ed their
authority, 3d July 1619. Nor could they do o|therwi&s;e;
<PB N="101" REF="114">
therwi&s;e; for it would have been ridiculous in
the King, to require evidence of a fact, that he
had better acce&s;s to know than any other per&s;on.
It is not therefore the &s;pecial &s;ervice that transfers
the heritage to the heir; nor is it the &s;pecial &s;er|vice
that &s;ubjects the heir to the debts of his an|ce&s;tor.
It is the infeftment that completes both
the active and pa&s;&s;ive titles: it transfers the pro|perty
of the e&s;tate to the heir; and con&s;equently
makes him liable for the predece&s;&s;or's debts. And
indeed &s;o little weight was laid upon the &s;ervice
after obtaining infeftment, that it was commonly
left in the chancery neglected, without even ta|king
an extract. But it was unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay
more than to appeal to an e&s;tabli&s;hed point,
which is, That if the heir, after expeding a &s;pe|cial
&s;ervice, &s;top &s;hort, and neither take in|feftment,
nor enter into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he will not be
liable for his ance&s;tor's debts, nor have right to
his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Neither is it the general &s;ervice that completes
the active and pa&s;&s;ive repre&s;entation of the heir,
with re&s;pect to heritable &s;ubjects that fall not un|der
a &s;pecial &s;ervice. It is ob&s;erved above, that
in &s;uch &s;ubjects <HI>mortuus &s;a&s;it vivum,</HI> and that
apprehending po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is the circum&s;tance that
completes both active and pa&s;&s;ive repre&s;entation.
So true this is, that if, after expeding a general
&s;ervice, the heir ab&s;tain from intermeddling, he
will be liable for none of his predece&s;&s;or's debts.
<PB N="102" REF="115">
That in practice the general &s;ervice is con&s;idered
as evidence only, will appear from the following
con&s;iderations. Fir&s;t, A debtor in an heritable
bond, if he be willing to wave a general &s;ervice,
pays &s;afely to the heir; and though that heir die
without a general &s;ervice, the heir next in &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
has no claim again&s;t the debtor; which
&s;hews, that the heir has right <HI>&s;ola &s;uperviven|tia;</HI>
and that a general &s;ervice is only nece&s;&s;ary
to a&s;certain that he is heir. That the court of
&s;e&s;&s;ion will have no difficulty to &s;u&s;tain &s;uch a
payment, there is rea&s;on to believe from analogy:
a debtor in a moveable bond, is not bound to
pay to the next of kin without a confirmation;
but if he pa&s;s from that formality, a di&s;charge
by the next of kin is always &s;u&s;tained as an ex|tinction
of the debt.</P>
<P>Second, It has been long an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim,
That a &s;pecial &s;ervice includes a general &s;ervice.
Taking a &s;ervice, general or &s;pecial, as a title to
the ance&s;tor's effects, the maxim cannot hold.
A &s;pecial &s;ervice, as ob&s;erved above, is not a
title to land, but only a means for obtaining from
the Sovereign a precept for infefting the heir,
which, with &s;ei&s;in upon it, completes his title.
And even &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;pecial &s;ervice to be a
title; it is confined to land in which the predece&s;|&s;or
died infeft, and reaches not any other heri|table
&s;ubject. A &s;pecial &s;ervice then, if held to
be a title, cannot include a general &s;ervice. But
<PB N="103" REF="116">
holding a &s;pecial &s;ervice, as it truly is, to be evi|dence
that the claimant is heir, the rea&s;on of the
maxim is obvious. A verdict finding me to be
heir of line, intitles me to demand from the &s;ove|reign
a renovation of my ance&s;tor's feu, provided
to him and his heirs of line. After which, there
is no nece&s;&s;ity of a new proof, when I demand
payment of an heritable bond that was due to
my ance&s;tor.</P>
<P>Third, Where in a bond &s;ecluding executors,
or containing a clau&s;e for infefting the creditor,
there is a nominatim &s;ub&s;titute, a general &s;ervice
is not nece&s;&s;ary. Why? becau&s;e where the heir
is named, there is no occa&s;ion for a proof. Were
a general &s;ervice nece&s;&s;ary for transferring heri|table
&s;ubjects from the ance&s;tor to his heir, it
would be no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to a nominatim &s;ub&s;ti|tute,
than to any other &s;ub&s;titute. And I mu&s;t
ob&s;erve in pa&s;&s;ing, that this is one of the ca&s;es
where the maxim holds in Scotland, <HI>Mortuus
&s;a&s;it vivum:</HI> a nominatim &s;ub&s;titute is not &s;ub|jected
to the predece&s;&s;or's debts beyond the value
of the &s;ubject; and therefore the &s;ubject ve&s;ts in
him <HI>&s;ola &s;uperviventia.</HI> An <HI>aditio hereditatis</HI>
is unnece&s;&s;ary where the heir runs no hazard.</P>
<P>It has indeed been doubted, whether a nomi|natim
&s;ub&s;titute in a &s;ubject where the in&s;titute
was infeft, can take without a &s;pecial &s;ervice.
But I can find no ground for the doubt; con&s;ider|ing
e&s;pecially, that a general &s;ervice is not requi|&s;ite
<PB N="104" REF="117">
to a nominatim &s;ub&s;titute in other heritable
&s;ubjects. No analogy appears more intimate,
than between a nominatim &s;ub&s;titute in an infeft|ment
of annualrent, and a nominatim &s;ub&s;titute
in an heritable bond where infeftment has not
been taken: a proof is not nece&s;&s;ary in the one
ca&s;e more than in the other. I venture, at the
&s;ame time, to conjecture the occa&s;ion of the
doubt. The practice in chancery, of requiring a
&s;pecial &s;ervice before i&s;&s;uing a precept for infeft|ing
the heir, is &s;o common, that in vain would e|ven
a nominatim &s;ub&s;titute demand &s;uch a precept
without a previous &s;ervice. And it is prudent in
the director of the chancery to adhere to e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
forms, without taking upon him to judge
how far &s;uch forms are e&s;&s;ential. But the prac|tice
of the chancery, whatever doubt it may oc|ca&s;ion,
affords certainly no argument for the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of a &s;pecial &s;ervice in this ca&s;e. At the
&s;ame time, there is one noted example, mention|ed
above, of a precept granted by the &s;overeign
without a previous &s;ervice. When King James,
in favour of his &s;on Prince Charles, i&s;&s;ued a pre|cept
of <HI>Clare con&s;tat</HI> of his being neare&s;t heir
to his mother Queen Anne, it would have been
ridiculous to have i&s;&s;ued a brieve for inquiring
into facts that could not be but well known to
the King; and it is no le&s;s ridiculous to demand a|ny
proof from a nominatim &s;ub&s;titute, when his
claim is legally vouched by an authentic writing.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="118">
I clo&s;e this &s;ubject with a ca&s;e that affords a
fair opportunity of applying the principles above
laid down. A purcha&s;er of land having obtained
a di&s;po&s;ition with procuratory and precept, dies
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but without being infe&s;t. What is
nece&s;&s;ary to be done by the heir for completing
his right to the land? It will be an&s;wered, that
a general &s;ervice transfers to the heir the di&s;po&s;i|tion
granted to his ance&s;tor; which intitles him
to take infeftment, by u&s;ing the procuratory or
precept, as the ance&s;tor him&s;elf might have done.
But is this form nece&s;&s;ary in all ca&s;es, or in the
pre&s;ent ca&s;e? About the heir I &s;uppo&s;e there is
no doubt. The heir, acknowledged by all to be
&s;o, continues his ance&s;tor's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land,
as well as of the di&s;po&s;ition, and of the heir&s;hip-moveables.
He levies the rents. The&s;e particu|lars
make a complete <HI>ge&s;tio pro herede,</HI> which
transfers to him the property of the di&s;po&s;ition, as
well as of the heir&s;hip-moveables. What better
right can a general &s;ervice be&s;tow on him? The
di&s;po&s;ition granted to his ance&s;tor is a <HI>corpus,</HI> of
which he is intitled to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and by that
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the property of the di&s;po&s;ition is tran&s;|ferred
to him, as well as of the heir&s;hip-move|ables.
What bars him then from u&s;ing the pro|curatory
or precept, as his predece&s;&s;or might have
done? He has no need of a general &s;ervice, be|cau&s;e
he has no occa&s;ion to prove any fact.</P>
<P>But however evident this may be, it is thought,
<PB N="106" REF="119">
with re&s;pect to land held of the crown, that the
Barons of Exchequer would not receive a re&s;igna|tion
from the heir upon the ance&s;tor's procurato|ry,
without a general &s;ervice. For here, as in a
precept from the chancery, more weight will
probably be laid upon practice than upon prin|ciple.
Where the land is held of a &s;ubject, there
is not the &s;ame difficulty. The heir of the di&s;po|nee
may u&s;e the procuratory of re&s;ignation grant|ed
to his predece&s;&s;or; and the &s;uperior, by that
re&s;ignation, is impowered to grant a charter,
which, with &s;ei&s;in, will complete the heir's right
to the land. But there is one way, by which the
heir may obtain a charter from the crown with|out
a general &s;ervice. He takes infeftment on the
precept, and becomes va&s;&s;al to the di&s;poner. The
Barons of Exchequer &s;urely in that ca&s;e would
make no difficulty to receive a re&s;ignation from
him, and to grant him a charter.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Executor.</HEAD>
<P>AN executor is a tru&s;tee appointed by a te|&s;tator
for collecting in his moveable effects
after his decea&s;e, and for converting them into
money, to be di&s;tributed among the parties con|cerned.
And where a man dies inte&s;tate, the ex|ecutor
is named by the commi&s;&s;ary-court.</P>
<P>Where an executor receives a &s;um from a debt|or
of the decea&s;ed, the money mu&s;t become his
property, being delivered to him as a &s;pecies, not
as a <HI>corpus;</HI> and for this &s;um, he becomes debtor
to tho&s;e intere&s;ted in the executry. But &s;uppo|&s;ing
an executor, after obtaining a decree again&s;t
an executry-debtor, to have died without levying
the money, will the decree fall under his own
executry? Sir Thomas Hope<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sect. 88. Minor Practi$s.</NOTE> lays it down,
that the decree de&s;cends not to his next of kin,
but tran&s;mits to an executor <HI>ad non executa.</HI>

of the debtor <HI>pa&s;&s;iv&egrave;,</HI> either by new &s;ecurity,
<PB N="108" REF="121">
or by decreet.&endq; Sir George Mackenzie deli|vers
the &s;ame opinion<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In&s;titutions, book 3. tit. 9. &s;ect. 16.</NOTE>, in the following words.
&startq;If the executor have not execute the te&s;tament
in his own lifetime, that is to &s;ay, have not
obtained decreets for the goods belonging to
the defunct, there will be place for a new exe|cutor
for executing the&s;e, who is called execu|tor
<HI>ad non executa.</HI>&endq; This in effect is hold|ing,
that a decree at the in&s;tance of an executor,
though obtained by him in quality of executor or
tru&s;tee, con&s;titutes him creditor in place of the
decea&s;ed, &s;ubjects him to the hazard of the debt
<HI>qua dominus,</HI> and renders him and his repre&s;en|tatives
accountable for the &s;um, though the debt|or
become in&s;olvent.</P>
<P>This point de&s;erves more attention than &s;eems
to have been given it, by the authors la&s;t men|tioned,
or by any writer &s;ince their time. I be|gin
with examining the ca&s;e of an executor te&s;ta|mentary
or dative, who have no intere&s;t but to
collect and di&s;tribute the moveable effects of the
decea&s;ed. To prevent embezzlement, the exe|cutor
mu&s;t, on oath, make an inventory of the&s;e
effects, and find caution to make them forthco|ming:
upon which he is confirmed by the com|mi&s;&s;ary;
and the confirmation is his title for inter|meddling
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mackenzie, In&s;tit. book 3. tit. 9. &s;ect. 15.</NOTE>. As it is the duty of this executor
to make the mo&s;t of the effects, he ought to di&s;|po&s;e
<PB N="109" REF="122">
of them by public auction, according to
which he mu&s;t account to the parties concerned;
and for that rea&s;on, it is of no u&s;e to &s;tate any
values in the inventory. This executor, being a
tru&s;tee merely, ought to be &s;ubjected to no ha|zard.
If a moveable happen to peri&s;h before
&s;ale by any accident, the per&s;ons intere&s;ted in the
executry-fund mu&s;t &s;uffer the lo&s;s: the executor
cannot run the ri&s;k of effects that belong not to
him. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, if a debtor of the
decea&s;ed become in&s;olvent after the executor has
obtained a decree again&s;t him, the executor can|not
be burdened with the debt, unle&s;s he have
been negligent in demanding payment. Payment
indeed made to him, extingui&s;hes the debt, and
renders him accountable for the &s;um he has re|ceived.
It clearly follows, that a decree again&s;t
a debtor by an executor te&s;tamentary or dative,
is not a complete execution of the te&s;tament:
the debt continues to be a part of the executry|fund;
and upon the executor's death, an execu|tor
<HI>ad non executa</HI> mu&s;t be appointed to levy the
&s;um contained in the decree. In this ca&s;e, there|fore,
the opinion of Sir Thomas Hope is un|doubtedly
well founded, and that of Stair and
Mackenzie erroneous. So far Lord Stair is right,
that the taking a new &s;ecurity in&s;tead of pay|ment,
and di&s;charging the original debt, is a
complete execution of the te&s;tament, &s;ubjecting
the executor to account for the &s;um contained in
<PB N="110" REF="123">
the di&s;charge. A bond of corroboration is dif|ferent;
for it may be a prudent act of admini|&s;tration,
to take &s;uch a bond when payment can|not
be obtained.</P>
<P>I proceed to an executor-creditor. Confirma|tion
is not to him a <HI>ce&s;io in jure</HI> of the &s;ubjects
confirmed: it affords him only a &s;ecurity upon
the&s;e &s;ubjects, which intitles him to convert them
into money for his payment. In a poinding
there is a ju&s;t appretiation of the goods; and ju|&s;tice
is not wounded, when the effects are adjud|ged
to the creditor for his payment, at the appri|&s;ed
values. But as in a creditor's confirmation,
there is no rule laid down for a ju&s;t appretiation,
nor for any appretiation, the law evidently in|tends,
that the effects &s;hould be &s;old by auction;
and that the creditor &s;hould account for what he
receives. According to this plan, the effects con|tinue
part of the executry-fund till they be &s;old.
If a moveable be de&s;troyed by accident, or a
debtor become in&s;olvent, the executry-fund is &s;o
far dimini&s;hed: the creditor lo&s;es his &s;ecurity;
but his claim continues entire, to be the founda|tion
of a new execution. Upon the &s;ame plan,
it holds equally, that a decree obtained by an ex|ecutor-creditor
again&s;t a debtor of the decea&s;ed,
is only an additional &s;ecurity. He is not bound
to accept of this decree as payment, nor to run
the ri&s;k of the debtor's &s;olvency. It would be
unju&s;t to &s;ubject him to the ri&s;k, when he has
<PB N="111" REF="124">
no choice, but mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t again&s;t the executry-debtors
&s;uch as they are. Hence it follows, that
if an executor-creditor, after obtaining a decree,
die without levying the money, there mu&s;t be
place for an executor <HI>ad non executa.</HI> But in
that ca&s;e the repre&s;entatives of the creditor ought
to be preferred to the office, in order that they
may recover payment of the debt confirmed,
which is now &s;ecured to them.</P>
<P>An executor <HI>qua</HI> next in kin, leads to a &s;pe|culation
of more intricacy. Among the Romans,
there was no di&s;tinction of effects with re&s;pect to
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion from the dead to the living: the near|e&s;t
male relation &s;ucceeded to the whole. In
Britain the predece&s;&s;or's e&s;tate is &s;plit into two:
the per&s;on who &s;ucceeds to the heritable e&s;tate, is
termed <HI>heir;</HI> and the next in kin, excepting the
heir, &s;ucceed to the moveable e&s;tate. The right
of the heir is e&s;tabli&s;hed by a proper <HI>aditio here|ditatis;</HI>
and it is natural to think, that &s;ome
form &s;imilar &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h the right of the next
in kin. In practice, however, the authority the
next in kin have to lay hold of the moveable e|&s;tate,
is derived from the commi&s;&s;ary-court: they
are named executors by that court; and they
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the moveables, as tru&s;tees, not
as heirs. Why &s;hould they not be impowered
to apprehend po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at &s;hort hand, as the heir
is impowered with re&s;pect to heir&s;hip-moveables,
or with re&s;pect to the rents of land? The my&s;te|ry
<PB N="112" REF="125">
is explained in the E&s;&s;ays on Briti&s;h Antiqui|ties
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay 4. toward the clo&s;e.</NOTE>. The moveables of a per&s;on dying inte|&s;tate
were &s;eized by the church, and di&s;po&s;ed of
by a tru&s;tee named by the church, termed <HI>execu|tor;</HI>
and nothing was more common than to ap|ply
the e&s;&s;ects <HI>ad pias cau&s;as,</HI> as pretended; a|bandoning
even the wife and children to poverty.
The next in kin, it is true, were, in proce&s;s of
time, re&s;tored to their legal rights: but the form
of their being named executors by the eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
court was continued; as there is nothing
more common than to pre&s;erve in practice, modes
and cu&s;toms, after the introductory cau&s;e is at an
end. At the &s;ame time, the nature of their right
tended to pre&s;erve in vigour the form of naming
them executors. As the fiction of the heir be|ing
the &s;ame per&s;on with his ance&s;tor, was never
introduced into the moveable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; the next
in kin is not liable even for moveable debts far|ther
than <HI>in valorem.</HI> And to prevent a tedious
count and reckoning, about the extent of the
moveable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and of the value, cu&s;tom
has e&s;tabli&s;hed an inventory, in which every par|ticular
&s;ubject is entered, &s;imilar to what is re|quired
in the confirmation of other executors;
and according to that inventory, the next in kin
account with the creditors and legatees of the de|cea&s;ed.
But though the ancient form remains,
&s;ub&s;tance is more regarded than form. Notwith|&s;tanding
<PB N="113" REF="126">
the title of executor, the next in kin
are ju&s;tly held to be heirs <HI>in mobilibus,</HI> as they
truly are; and the confirmation is now con&s;idered
in no other light than as the <HI>aditio hereditatis
in mobilibus.</HI> The confirmation accordingly
transfers to the next in kin, the property of the
moveables, and the <HI>jus crediti</HI> of the debts;
whence it follows, that if any &s;ubject peri&s;h after
confirmation, it peri&s;hes to the next in kin <HI>qua
domini.</HI> At the &s;ame time, as they are bound
to pay debts and legacies <HI>in valorem</HI> of what
they &s;ucceed to, they annex to the inventory the
value of each particular &s;ubject, &s;uch as they are
willing to account for. If the parties intere&s;ted
are di&s;&s;atisfied with the&s;e values, any one credi|tor
or legatee may apply for a confirmation <HI>ad
male appretiata,</HI> &s;tating higher values in his in|ventory.
By this confirmation he takes the ha|zard
of the moveables upon him&s;elf; and ac|counts
for his own values. In this ca&s;e alone, as
far as I can di&s;cover, is there any proper ground
for a confirmation <HI>ad male appretiata:</HI> it is un|nece&s;&s;ary
and improper in the ca&s;e of an execu|tor-dative,
or executor-creditor, where the effects
ought to be di&s;po&s;ed of by public auction. This
contrivance again&s;t a low appretiation, is not a
little awkward, and is not much in u&s;e; for what
creditor, to obtain payment perhaps of a &s;mall
debt, will undertake the hazard of a large fund
of executry? A more &s;imple method, attended
<PB N="114" REF="127">
with no hazard, is to apply for a &s;ale of the ef|fects,
as is done by creditors where an heir enters
<HI>cum beneficio inventarii.</HI> I take it for granted,
that the next in kin may take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
moveables at &s;hort hand, without confirmation,
which will transfer to them the property of the
moveables: the heir&s;hip-moveables are transfer|red
to the heir by the &s;ame means. But then the
next in kin mu&s;t, in that ca&s;e, reckon on the
whole bent of the law again&s;t them: if the con|trary
be not made clearly appear, it will be pre|&s;umed,
that they have got &s;ufficient to pay every
debt of the ance&s;tor. So far only they will be
ea&s;ed, that the pre&s;umption will not be extended
in favour of legatees. At the &s;ame time, to pre|vent,
as much as po&s;&s;ible, the next in kin from
intermeddling hiddenly, every debtor of the de|cea&s;ed
is authori&s;ed to refu&s;e payment, till he &s;ee
a confirmation, and his debt in&s;erted in the inven|tory.</P>
<P>From this long excur&s;ion, we return to the
propo&s;ition &s;tated at the beginning. I have en|deavoured
to make out, that the opinion of Hope
is well founded, with re&s;pect to an executor-da|tive,
and executor-creditor; and con&s;equently
that the oppo&s;ite opinion of Stair and Mackenzie
is erroneous. But, as far as I can judge, none
of them are right with re&s;pect to an executor <HI>qua</HI>
next in kin. They &s;ucceed to the moveable e|&s;tate,
as the heir does to the immoveable. Con|firmation
<PB N="115" REF="128">
is the <HI>aditio hereditatis</HI> in the former,
as &s;ervice is in the latter. A &s;ervice with infeft|ment
completes the heir's right to the land-e&s;tate:
confirmation completes the next in kin's right to
the debts, and <HI>ip&s;a corpora</HI> of the moveables.
The next in kin confirmed are, in every view,
&s;imilar to an heir <HI>cum beneficio</HI> infeft. The pro|perty
is theirs, and they are only bound to ac|count
for the value.</P>
<P>If now the confirmation of an executor <HI>qua</HI>
next in kin be a title of property, as it undoubt|edly
is, the two following propo&s;itions are nece&s;|&s;ary
con&s;equences. The fir&s;t is, That as the move|ables
are ve&s;ted in the next in kin, any acciden|tal
lo&s;s re&s;ts upon them, and they &s;till remain ac|countable
for the appri&s;ed values. A fall in the
market-price of the goods, will not defend them
from paying the&s;e values: nor will a &s;udden &s;tart
in the market, make them liable beyond the&s;e
values. Nay, &s;hould a barn full of corn be burnt
<HI>ca&s;u fortuitu</HI> the in&s;tant after confirmation, they
mu&s;t notwith&s;tanding account for the&s;e values.
The next propo&s;ition is, That even with re&s;pect to
debts, there is no place for an executor <HI>ad non
executa.</HI> The confirmation transfers to the next
in kin the right that their ance&s;tor had when a|live:
the <HI>jus crediti,</HI> being e&s;tabli&s;hed in them,
tran&s;mits of cour&s;e to their repre&s;entatives; and
there is no place for an executor <HI>ad non executa.</HI>
This was found in a deliberate deci&s;ion, 24th June
<PB N="116" REF="129">
1737, Mitchell <HI>contra</HI> Mitchell of Blairgots;
which is the be&s;t authority, next to an act of par|liament,
for maintaining, that confirmation is the
<HI>aditio hereditatis in mobilibus</HI> with re&s;pect to
the next in kin; that the moveable e&s;tate is
thereby ve&s;ted in them as formerly in the decea|&s;ed;
and con&s;equently, that they run the hazard
of the goods confirmed, and tran&s;mit the &s;ame to
their repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>In many particulars there is a &s;trong analogy
between the heir <HI>cum beneficio,</HI> and the next in
kin confirmed executors. If the creditors be
content with the value, the accidental de&s;truction
of any &s;ubject contained in the inventory, will
not relieve either of them from being accountable
for its value. The heir may avoid all hazards,
whether of &s;ubjects or of debts, by u&s;ing for his
title a tru&s;t-adjudication; and the next in kin may
avoid all &s;uch hazards, by obtaining them&s;elves
to be confirmed executors-dative. In that quali|ty,
they run no ri&s;k: they levy the debts that
can be recovered, &s;ell the moveables that exi&s;t,
make a dividend among the creditors, &amp;c. and
retain the &s;urplus to them&s;elves. If the creditors,
declining to accept of the value, in&s;i&s;t to bring
the effects to a public &s;ale, this &s;tep relieves the
heir <HI>cum beneficio,</HI> as well as the next in kin,
from any ri&s;k: it would be again&s;t con&s;cience to
force a &s;ale of the &s;ubjects that exi&s;t, and, at the
<PB N="117" REF="130">
&s;ame time, to make them liable for the value of
the &s;ubjects that do not exi&s;t.</P>
<P>To &s;um up the whole: It appears, that Sir
Thomas Hope's opinion holds only with re&s;pect
to an executor-dative and executor-creditor, the
only ca&s;es he probably had in view; and that
the opinion of Lord Stair, and Sir George Mac|kenzie,
holds not in any ca&s;e. A decree obtain|ed
again&s;t an executry-debtor, by an executor-dative
or executor-creditor, is but an inchoated
execution, which, after their death, mu&s;t be com|pleted
by an executor <HI>ad non executa.</HI> Very
different is the ca&s;e of an executor <HI>qua</HI> next in
kin. His confirmation is complete execution,
becau&s;e it transfers to him the property of the
moveables, and the <HI>jus crediti</HI> of the debts, lea|ving
nothing <HI>in hereditate</HI> of the decea&s;ed. Con|firmation
accordingly &s;ubjects the executor <HI>qua</HI>
next in kin to the ri&s;k of the &s;ubjects confirmed,
and after his death tran&s;mits them to his repre|&s;entatives.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Whether arre&s;tment or confirmation can
proceed upon an infeftment of annual|rent.</HEAD>
<P>AN infeftment of annualrent was originally a
wad&s;et. It was invented when, by a fool|i&s;h
regulation of the Canon law, intere&s;t was
prohibited to be taken for the loan of money.
The law was evaded by purcha&s;ing an incumbrance
upon land, intitling the lender to levy rents e|quivalent
to the intere&s;t of his money; and the
money was delivered to the borrower, not as a
&s;um to bear intere&s;t, but as the price of the in|cumbrance.
The borrower could redeem his land
by repayment of the money; and the lender could
demand his money upon renouncing the incum|brance.
While the incumbrance &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, there
was no debt; and the lender had no claim again&s;t
the borrower per&s;onally, till the incumbrance
was renounced. This was a cumber&s;ome mode
for making money bear intere&s;t; and after inte|re&s;t
for money became lawful commerce, a more
&s;imple and commodious mode was introduced.
The borrower is taken bound per&s;onally to pay
the money with intere&s;t; and to &s;ecure the pay|ment,
he infefts the creditor in his land. Here
<PB N="119" REF="132">
the per&s;onal obligation is the principal; and the
infeftment is acce&s;&s;ory only.</P>
<P>As an heritable bond is not a moveable &s;ubject
to be carried by confirmation, it is commonly
thought, that neither can it be u&s;ed as a title for
confirming a moveable &s;ubject. But this appears
to be erroneous. In the old form, indeed, of
an infeftment of annualrent, no debt exi&s;ted to
be the foundation either of an arre&s;tment or of a
confirmation. But, in its pre&s;ent form, there is
a per&s;onal obligation for paying the &s;um borrow|ed,
upon which arre&s;tment and confirmation may
be founded, as well as upon a moveable bond.
Now as a real creditor may demand payment
from the executor; and a per&s;onal creditor may
demand payment from the heir; there is nothing
to bar a creditor, by an infeftment of annualrent,
from confirming as executor-creditor, nor from
arre&s;ting a &s;um due to his debtor.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">What degree of mora deprives an adjudger
of the benefit of litigio&s;ity.</HEAD>
<P>LAW is rea&s;onably jealous of a debtor, that
when vexed with execution, he may be
tempted to alien his &s;ubject, in order to di&s;ap|point
the creditor. Law therefore be&s;tows on
inchoated execution, the privilege of an inhibi|tion,
to bar the debtor from di&s;appointing the ex|ecution
by alienting the &s;ubject; and this is the
meaning of the expre&s;&s;ion, that inchoated execu|tion
renders the &s;ubject litigious. But the cre|ditor
is ju&s;tly deprived of this privilege, if he
make any unu&s;ual delay in completing his execu|tion;
which leads to the que&s;tion, What degree
of diligence is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the privilege?
An arre&s;tment is an inchoated execution, that
renders the &s;ubject litigious. The creditor is <HI>in
cur&s;u diligentiae,</HI> till he obtain a decree of forth|coming;
and any unu&s;ual <HI>mora</HI> or delay in ob|taining
that decree, will take off the litigio&s;ity,
and give preference to any voluntary right grant|ed
by the common debtor after the arre&s;tment.
An adjudication is completed by infeftment,
which, by its own nature, be&s;tows a preference,
without the privilege of litigio&s;ity. But while the
<PB N="122" REF="135">
adjudger is <HI>in cur&s;u diligentiae</HI> to obtain infeft|ment,
the privilege of litigio&s;ity &s;ecures the land
contained in the adjudication from being aliened
by the debtor. And here the que&s;tion ari&s;es,
What degree of diligence is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve
the privilege of litigio&s;ity entire. The fir&s;t
&s;tep for obtaining infeftment, is to charge the
&s;uperior; after which the adjudger mu&s;t &s;top,
till the &s;uperior find lei&s;ure to infeft him. So far
clear. But, in order to pre&s;erve the privilege, is
it nece&s;&s;ary that the adjudger proceed to a charge
again&s;t the &s;uperior? It is univer&s;ally held, that
the charge is nece&s;&s;ary. This is the opinion of
Lord Stair: &startq;And generally voluntary rights are
excluded, being granted after the denunciation
of lands to be appri&s;ed, until infeftment be ob|tained,
or a charge again&s;t the &s;uperior; all
which is the creditor's being <HI>in cur&s;u diligen|tis;</HI>
and after a competent time for obtaining
infeftment, or charging the &s;uperior, any po|&s;terior
or voluntary right is preferable to the
appri&s;ing; as was found in the competition of
the creditors of Langton<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Book 3. tit. 2. &s;ect. 20.</NOTE>.&endq; And again<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">&s;ect. 29. of the &s;ame title.</NOTE>,
&startq;But &s;ince the act of parliament, bringing in
appri&s;ers <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u,</HI> the fir&s;t effectual appri|&s;ing
is declared to be either by infeftment, or

in&s;i&s;ting.&endq; This opinion has been followed by
the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion in every deci&s;ion. Thus it
was found, &startq;That denunciation of appri&s;ing
makes the &s;ubject litigious; after which the

&startq;Denunciation of appri&s;ing renders the &s;ubject
litigious; after which every voluntary aliena|tion
by the debtor, even for a price told down,
to prevent the appri&s;er <HI>in cur&s;u diligentiae,</HI> is
ineffectual: but where the appri&s;er was &s;ilent
and negligent by the &s;pace of ten years with|out
infeftment or charge, and without pur&s;uing
fo$ mails and duties, he was not allowed to
plead the litigio&s;ity, &s;ince it could not be &s;aid

<P>The&s;e great authorities notwith&s;tanding, I can|not
help doubting, whether a charge again&s;t the
<PB N="124" REF="137">
&s;uperior be nece&s;&s;ary. Whatever nece&s;&s;ity there
may have been originally for infeftment or a
charge, to pre&s;erve the privilege, I &s;ee not, as
our law &s;tands at pre&s;ent, that an adjudger du|ring
the legal is bound to do any &s;ort of dili|gence.
I &s;ee not that <HI>mora</HI> can be imputed to
him, for not proceeding to charge the &s;uperior,
or to apprehend po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. While an appri|&s;ing
was a judicial &s;ale of the land, an appri&s;er
could not po&s;&s;e&s;s without infeftment: the &s;upe|rior
was intitled to have a va&s;&s;al.; and he had an
intere&s;t to in&s;i&s;t for payment of a year's rent for
change of the va&s;&s;al<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Stair, 22d July 1665, John&s;ton <HI>contra</HI> tenants of Auchincor&s;e.</NOTE>. But an appri&s;ing, during
the legal, having degenerated to be a <HI>pignus
praetorium</HI> only, it was thought hard upon the
debtor, to oblige the appri&s;er, during the legal,
to pay a year's rent to the &s;uperior. The court
accordingly came to a re&s;olution to permit the
appri&s;er to po&s;&s;e&s;s during the legal, without de|manding
infeftment, and con&s;equently without
paying a year's rent to the &s;uperior<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, 3d December 1672, Hay <HI>contra</HI> Earl&s;ton.</NOTE>. And this
has been the con&s;tant practice ever &s;ince<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Stair, book 2. tit. 3. &s;ect. 30.</NOTE>.
Now, if an adjudger be not bound to take in|feftment
during the legal, he cannot be bound to
charge the &s;uperior to give him infeftment. It
would indeed be ab&s;urd to make &s;uch a charge
<PB N="125" REF="138">
a nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep of diligence, when the adjudger
is neither willing nor obliged to accept of infeft|ment.
Neither can the forbearing to take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
be imputed to the adjudger as a <HI>mora;</HI> be|cau&s;e
his right, which is a &s;ecurity only, leaves
him at liberty to levy the rents or not, as he finds
it convenient. Adjudgers are commonly unwil|ling
to &s;ubject them&s;elves to a count and reckon|ing:
they will have their money in a lump, or
the land, in&s;tead of their money, when the le|gal
expires. Weighing the&s;e particulars, there
appears not any foundation for the imputation of
<HI>mora</HI> during the legal, though the adjudger nei|ther
charge the &s;uperior, nor enter into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.
And with re&s;pect to the deci&s;ions above men|tioned,
in two of them the legal is mentioned as
expired; after which undoubtedly an adjudger is
<HI>in mora,</HI> if he neither take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, nor charge
the &s;uperior to infeft him.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be objected, that as, during
the legal, an adjudication is not an effectual dili|gence
without a charge again&s;t the &s;uperior, an
adjudger is really <HI>in mora</HI> if he &s;top &s;hort, and
make not his diligence effectual. It is true, that
the act 1661 declares an adjudication to be effec|tual
upon which infeftment has followed, or the
fir&s;t exact diligence for obtaining infeftment;
and it has been found by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion,
that a &s;imple charge again&s;t the &s;uperior is exact
diligence in the &s;en&s;e of the &s;tatute. But re|mark,
<PB N="126" REF="139">
that this act pa&s;&s;ed while both law and cu|&s;tom
obliged appri&s;ers to take infeftment, with|out
which their appri&s;ings were reckoned incom|plete,
even during the legal. Our pre&s;ent prac|tice
differs widely. As adjudgers are thought to
be rigorous who take infeftment during the legal,
the legi&s;lature, I am convinced, would not re|quire,
during the legal, either infeftment, or a
charge again&s;t the &s;uperior. However this be,
the &s;tatute had laid down a rule for ranking com|peting
appri&s;ers; and the &s;tatute mu&s;t be obeyed.
But there is no &s;tatute upon the pre&s;ent point.
An adjudger, in order to exclude other creditors
who adjudge after year and day, mu&s;t charge the
&s;uperior; but though he forbear to charge during
the legal, the &s;ubject continues to be litigious, &s;o
as to exclude every voluntary conveyance by the
debtor done during the legal.</P>

<HI>Title</HI> is defined by Lord Coke<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Coke upon Littleton, &s;ect. 649.</NOTE> to be the
<HI>means</HI> by which a right is e&s;tabli&s;hed. This de|finition
is imperfect: con&s;ent is a <HI>means</HI> by
which many rights are e&s;tabli&s;hed, and money is
another; yet neither of the&s;e is held to be a title.
On the other hand, there are many <HI>titles</HI> that
are not the <HI>means</HI> of e&s;tabli&s;hing a right. A
minute of &s;ale is evidence of the bargain, and is
al&s;o the vender's title in an action again&s;t the
buyer for the price; but con&s;ent, and not the
minute of &s;ale, is the means by which the right
is e&s;tabli&s;hed. Sometimes, indeed, as above
mentioned, the means by which a right is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
is, at the &s;ame time, the pur&s;uer's title;
but this is far from being always &s;o.</P>
<P>The pur&s;uer's right is, in &s;everal in&s;tances, no|torious,
requiring no evidence. A young man,
bred up in his father's family, claims the rents
of his father's e&s;tate as his &s;on and heir: his
right ari&s;es from his apparency; and his appa|rency,
being notorious, requires no evidence.
This, in law-language, is expre&s;&s;ed by &s;aying,
that the pur&s;uer requires no title for carrying on
&s;uch proce&s;s.</P>
<P>Lord Stair divides titles into two kinds; origi|nal,
and by progre&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In&s;titutes, book 4. tit. 38. &s;ect. 19.</NOTE>. The evidence of an o|riginal
right, is an original title. A bond for a
&s;um of money, is a proper example: a right is
<PB N="129" REF="142">
created to the creditor again&s;t the debtor by con|&s;ent;
and the bond, being the evidence of the
right, is the creditor's title in an action for pay|ment.
When a right is conveyed from one per|&s;on
to another, the evidence of the conveyance
is the purcha&s;er's title in every proce&s;s for ma|king
the right effectual. Infeftment on a re|tour,
confirmation of an executor, an a&s;&s;ign|ment,
a di&s;po&s;ition, an adjudication, are titles by
progre&s;s.</P>
<P>The title nece&s;&s;ary in a reduction on the head
of deathbed, is original. A deed, though grant|ed
on deathbed, is effectual again&s;t the granter;
and as it cannot be challenged by him, neither
can it be challenged by any in his right. But as
an heir is protected by law again&s;t the deathbed-deeds
of his predece&s;&s;or, &s;uch a deed is chal|lengeable
by the heir in his own right. Accor|dingly,
to found the reduction, the only evidence
required is, that the pur&s;uer is heir; and when
that is notorious, as it commonly is, we &s;ay,
that the pur&s;uer requires no title. But when the
relation is &s;o di&s;tant, as to require evidence, the
evidence, whether by writ or by witne&s;&s;es, is the
pur&s;uer's title. As the title here is original, the
heir's &s;erving to his predece&s;&s;or will not bar the
reduction; for he repre&s;ents not his predece&s;&s;or
with re&s;pect to a deathbed-deed, again&s;t which
he is privileged by law. He re&s;embles an heir
of entail, who repre&s;ents not his predece&s;&s;or as to
<PB N="130" REF="143">
any alienation of the entailed e&s;tate. But in re|ducing
the deathbed-deed, the heir's &s;ervice can|not
be his title; for the reduction is founded on
his own right, not upon his being <HI>eadem per&s;ona
cum defuncto.</HI></P>
<P>Next in order come titles by progre&s;s. A
&s;pecial &s;ervice, with infeftment, is the heir's title
in every action relative to the &s;ubjects thus con|veyed
to him; and a general &s;ervice is his title in
every action relative to &s;ubjects conveyed to him
by the general &s;ervice. An heir, claiming upon
a di&s;po&s;ition to land made to his predece&s;&s;or,
mu&s;t have a general &s;ervice for his title. The
general &s;ervice an&s;wers two purpo&s;es: it is, fir&s;t,
the <HI>means</HI> of transferring the &s;ubject to the heir;
and is, next, his title in every action relative to
the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The right a man has to reduce a di&s;po&s;ition of
land unduly obtained from him, is transferred to
his heir by a general &s;ervice, which con&s;equently
is the heir's title to carry on the reduction. Ex|ample:
A man is, by fraud, induced to grant a
di&s;po&s;ition of his land, and the di&s;ponce is infeft
on the procuratory. The que&s;tion is, What
title is nece&s;&s;ary to the heir, after the di&s;poner's
death, in a reduction on fraud and circumven|tion?
He cannot &s;erve heir in &s;pecial to land
which did not belong to his predece&s;&s;or at his
death. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, he cannot be char|ged
to enter to it upon a tru&s;t-bond, granted in
<PB N="131" REF="144">
order to lead an adjudication. Neither will his
apparency &s;erve him as a title, becau&s;e he cannot
&s;pecify him&s;elf to be heir-apparent in the land.
A general &s;ervice is the title, becau&s;e it conveys
to him his predece&s;&s;or's right to challenge the di&s;|po&s;ition
elicited from him by fraud and circum|vention.
But may not the heir &s;ue in his own
right, without nece&s;&s;ity of a general &s;ervice;
which ought to be avoided, if po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e it
&s;ubjects him to all his predece&s;&s;or's debts? The
following argument may be urged in his fa|vour.
Ju&s;tice forbids the fraudulent acquirer to
retain the &s;ubject. He is bound, in con&s;cience,
to re&s;tore it to the di&s;poner; and, after his death,
to the heir. The heir con&s;equently has right to
demand a conveyance by a proce&s;s, if not done
voluntarily. The argument appears well found|ed,
&s;uppo&s;ing the fraud and circumvention to
be admitted. And upon that medium it was
found, that the heir-apparent who could challenge
the di&s;po&s;ition, might ratify it; and that his rati|fication
did, after his death, exclude all the di&s;|poner's
other heirs<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">17th February 1761, Gordon <HI>contra</HI> Ogilvie.</NOTE>. But what if the fraud and
circumvention be denied? Will it be &s;ufficient
for the heir to bring a proof of it in his proce&s;s
of reduction; which proof will be his title, and,
at the &s;ame time, found the reduction? If the
pur&s;uer &s;ucceed in his proof, the de&s;endant has
no ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint. But he may &s;ail in
<PB N="132" REF="145">
his proof; and it would be unju&s;t to oblige the
purcha&s;er to &s;u&s;tain a proce&s;s which could not af|ford
him an ab&s;olvitor but again&s;t the pur&s;uer on|ly,
leaving him open to other heirs after the pur|&s;uer's
death. At that rate, he might be &s;ubject|ed
to proce&s;&s;es without end. The law will never
permit &s;uch a grievance. And yet, on the other
hand, it would be equally grievous, to tie up the
hands of an heir from challenging a gro&s;s impo|&s;ition
upon his predece&s;&s;or, unle&s;s the heir will
run the ri&s;k of being reduced to beggary by his
ance&s;tor's creditors. In my apprehen&s;ion, the
grievance on both &s;ides may be removed, by the
heir's taking out a general &s;ervice, limited, in ex|pre&s;s
terms, to the right his predece&s;&s;or had to
challenge the di&s;po&s;ition on fraud and circumven|tion.
This mode will &s;ecure the acquirer, if he
obtain an ab&s;olvitor, from being liable to any o|ther
heir: And it will &s;ecure the heir from being
liable to his predece&s;&s;or's debts, beyond the pro|fit
he makes by the proce&s;s.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e now the fraudulent acquirer not to be
infeft. The heir, in that ca&s;e, is at no lo&s;s for a
title. He may complete his right to the e&s;tate,
by a &s;pecial &s;ervice, by an adjudication upon a
tru&s;t-bond, or by a general &s;ervice in the form a|bove
mentioned. Any of the&s;e will be a good
title for reduction.</P>
<P>Take another example: A di&s;po&s;ition of land
is obtained from a minor under the value, and
<PB N="133" REF="146">
the di&s;ponee is infeft. The di&s;poner, in his own
right, may in&s;i&s;t in a reduction on the head of
minority and le&s;ion; and his heir may in&s;i&s;t, in
the &s;ame proce&s;s, upon the title of a general &s;er|vice,
qualified as above mentioned, if he be a|fraid
of debts. Suppo&s;ing the di&s;ponee not to be
infeft, the heir has the &s;ame titles to chu&s;e upon,
that he has in reducing a di&s;po&s;ition obtained from
his predece&s;&s;or by fraud.</P>
<P>An action of improbation is of two kinds.
One challenges deeds affecting the pur&s;uer's land;
the other challenges deeds affecting his predece&s;|&s;or
per&s;onally. To carry on the former, the pur|&s;uer
mu&s;t in&s;truct that he is proprietor: to carry
on the latter, he mu&s;t in&s;truct, that he is per&s;o|nally
liable to the debts of his predece&s;&s;or. For
if he be neither proprietor, nor be per&s;onally
liable, he has no intere&s;t to rai&s;e a proce&s;s of ei|ther
kind. An heir accordingly, in order to car|ry
on an improbation of deeds affecting the fa|mily-e&s;tate,
mu&s;t fir&s;t enter heir, and complete
his right to the e&s;tate by infeftment. And in or|der
to carry on an improbation of debts affecting
his predece&s;&s;or per&s;onally, a general &s;ervice is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
as a title; becau&s;e it &s;ubjects him to all
the debts and deeds of his predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to a purcha&s;er of land, it is a rule,
That, in order to challenge any infeftment on the
land, he mu&s;t be infeft; becau&s;e none but the
proprietor has right to challenge any deed affect|ing
<PB N="134" REF="147">
his land. An adjudger, it is true, even with|out
infeftment, has right to the rents; and con|&s;equently
may challenge any deed, not excepting
an infeftment, &s;o far as it ob&s;tructs his levying the
rents. But as his right carries him no farther,
an action will not be &s;u&s;tained at his in&s;tance, to
reduce the infeftment <HI>funditus.</HI> Whether a de|cree
of adjudication may not be &s;u&s;tained as a
title to carry on a tentative proce&s;s, &s;hall be exa|mined
afterward.</P>
<P>What is &s;aid upon the titles nece&s;&s;ary for challen|ging
real rights, is applicable to what are nece&s;&s;a|ry
for challenging per&s;onal rights. If an a&s;&s;ign|ment
to a bond for borrowed money, procured
by unlawful means, be completed by intimation,
the ced$nt may, in his own right, challenge the
a&s;&s;ignment; and &s;o may his next in kin, upon
confirming his predece&s;&s;or's right of challenge.
Confirmation is nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e it protects the
a&s;&s;ignee, if he obtain an ab&s;olvitor, again&s;t any
future challenge. If there be no intimation, the
next in kin may confirm the bond it&s;elf, which
confirmation will be their title in a reduction of
the a&s;&s;ignment.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed titles by progre&s;s in the per|&s;on
of an heir, we proceed to titles nece&s;&s;ary to
creditors. There is no occa&s;ion to take under
con&s;ideration an action again&s;t the debtor him&s;elf,
the title of which is obvious. What we have in
view, are actions that a creditor may carry on
<PB N="135" REF="148">
in his debtor's name. With re&s;pect to a reduc|tion
on minority and le&s;ion, on inhibition, or on
deathbed, which the per&s;on directly intere&s;ted
declines to carry on, it is a matter of &s;ome nicety,
whether his creditors can carry it on. I give,
for an example, an alienation on deathbed, which
the heir, who is bankrupt, refu&s;es to challenge.
His creditors have not right, at common law, to
bring the reduction; for as the privilege is per&s;o|nal
to the heir, it cannot be exerci&s;ed by his cre|ditors,
unle&s;s upon a mandate from him. But it
being unju&s;t in a debtor, to with-hold from his
creditors any &s;ubject, or any privilege, that may
contribute to their payment, it is his duty to in|&s;i&s;t
in the reduction; and if he be refractory, a
court of equity will impower his creditors to car|ry
it on in his name. This is the only remedy,
where the purcha&s;er from the predece&s;&s;or &s;tands
infeft. But where he is not infeft, the creditors
have no occa&s;ion for an extraordinary remedy:
they may adjudge the land, after charging their
debtor to enter heir. This adjudication will
transfer the land to the creditors; and their right
to the land intitles them to reduce the deathbed-deed.</P>
<P>The following is an example of the &s;ame kind.
A man, from whom a di&s;po&s;ition of land has been
obtained by fraud, becoming bankrupt, finds no
benefit to him&s;elf in bringing a reduction. His
creditors, if the purcha&s;er be infeft, cannot ad|judge
<PB N="136" REF="149">
the land: but they are authori&s;ed in equi|ty
to bring a reduction in name of the di&s;poner,
their debtor; and the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, as a court
of equity, will &s;u&s;tain the reduction, upon the
creditors producing their vouchers of debt, which
is their title.</P>
<P>But what if the debtor die before rai&s;ing the
proce&s;s, or before it be concluded? The credi|tors
mu&s;t charge the debtor's heir to enter heir
in general; and having, by that means, &s;ubject|ed
him to their debts, they mu&s;t proceed to what
is termed <HI>a general &s;pecial charge,</HI> charging
the heir to enter to all heritable &s;ubjects which
the predece&s;&s;or died po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of without being
infeft. The creditors will thus obtain an adjudi|cation
of all &s;ubjects that are carried by a general
&s;ervice, including the predece&s;&s;or's right to re|duce
the di&s;po&s;ition obtained from him by fraud;
and this adjudication is a title to carry on the re|duction.
If the heir renounce, an adjudication
<HI>contra hereditatem jacentem</HI> will be the title.
Suppo&s;e next, that infeftment has not pa&s;&s;ed up|on
the fraudulent di&s;po&s;ition. In that ca&s;e, the
debtor remaining proprietor, a &s;pecial charge a|gain&s;t
his heir will impower the creditors to ad|judge
the e&s;tate it&s;elf; and the adjudication will
to them be a good title to reduce the fraudulent
di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>To &s;ave a tedious and expen&s;ive circuit of di|ligence
again&s;t the heir, when the debtor dies
<PB N="137" REF="150">
before the proce&s;s of reduction is completed, it
will be a prudent &s;tep, to begin with adjudging
the land from the debtor him&s;elf, where the frau|dulent
di&s;ponee is not infeft; or with adjudging
their debtor's right of challenge, where the frau|dulent
di&s;ponee is infeft. Upon that title, they
may carry on the proce&s;s of reduction, even after
the death of their debtor.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rules are applicable to a reduction car|ried
on by creditors founded on their debtor's mi|nority
and le&s;ion, or carried on by them on the
ground of interdiction. With re&s;pect to a reduction
on the ground of inhibition, which the creditors of
the inhibiter de&s;ire to carry on, they may arre&s;t
the debt on which the inhibition is founded: a
decree of forthcoming will transfer to them from
their debtor the <HI>jus crediti;</HI> which of cour&s;e will
intitle them, as judicial a&s;&s;ignees, to carry on the
proce&s;s of reduction.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to a proce&s;s of removing, it is e|vident
in the fir&s;t place, that the proprietor's
charter and &s;ei&s;in make an effectual title, to re|move
every man from his land who has not a
current lea&s;e to defend his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In the
next place, though a man who has a di&s;po&s;ition
to land without infeftment, is not proprietor;
yet if he grant a lea&s;e, and take from the le&s;&s;ee
an obligation to remove at a term &s;pecified, the
obligation conveyed to a new le&s;&s;ee, will intitle
him to bring a removing in his own name. His
<PB N="138" REF="151">
lea&s;e gives him an intere&s;t to carry on the pro|ce&s;s;
and the obligation is his title. In the third
place, with regard to a tenant who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es by
a lea&s;e from a former proprietor, the infeftment
of the pre&s;ent proprietor is a good title for remo|ving
that tenant when the lea&s;e is at an end:
but he cannot impower his own le&s;&s;ee to carry on
the removing in the le&s;&s;ee's own name, otherwi&s;e
than by conveying the property to him. A man|date
to carry on the removing in the proprietor's
name, will be effectual; but a mandate to carry
on the removing in the le&s;&s;ee's own name, is <HI>ul|tra
vires</HI> of the proprietor.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e this e&s;&s;ay with examining what title is
nece&s;&s;ary in a tentative proce&s;s, &s;uch as paves the
way to what is ultimately intended. An exhi|bition
<HI>ad deliberandum,</HI> is a proper example of
a tentative proce&s;s: it is of no benefit to the pur|&s;uer,
but as affording him means to deliberate
whether it be his intere&s;t to enter heir or not.
An heir-apparent has a year for this deliberation;
and the law gives him in&s;pection of all writings
that may enable him to form a prudent re&s;olution.
This action then is founded on the pur&s;uer's per|&s;onal
privilege; and the notoriety of being heir|apparent
is his title.</P>
<P>I proceed to other examples. Before an in|hibiter
can challenge a di&s;po&s;ition granted by his
debtor, common law requires, that he adjudge
the &s;ubject aliened; becau&s;e, if he have no right
<PB N="139" REF="152">
to the land, he has no intere&s;t to challenge any
deed affecting it. An adjudication, therefore, is
the inhibiter's title to carry on the proce&s;s of re|duction;
and it is be&s;ide the pur&s;uer's title to the
land, if he prevail in the reduction. But what if
he do not prevail? In that ca&s;e, both parties &s;uf|fer
by the adjudication: the pur&s;uer lo&s;es the ex|pence
he was at in adjudging; and the defend|ant's
property is burdened with an adjudication,
which, though rendered ineffectual by the ab&s;ol|vitor,
makes however an ob&s;truction in a &s;ale.
Upon that account, it has been for many years
the practice, to &s;u&s;tain a reduction on the ground
of inhibition, as a tentative proce&s;s, without a
preparatory adjudication. If the pur&s;uer &s;ucceed
in his reduction, he then proceeds to adjudge:
if the defendant be a&s;&s;oilzied, his land is free
from the adjudication. The ab&s;olvitor, at the
&s;ame time, &s;ecures the defendant again&s;t all future
challenge: it is effectual again&s;t the pur&s;uer;
and it mu&s;t be equally effectual again&s;t tho&s;e who
derive right from him to the bond upon which the
inhibition proceeded, whether heirs or &s;ingular
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>There was occa&s;ion above to ob&s;erve, that a
decree of adjudication is not a legal title to chal|lenge
any infeftment upon the land adjudged;
but whether it may not be &s;u&s;tained as a tentative
title, &s;hall now be con&s;idered. It is hard to ob|lige
the adjudger to be at the expence of an in|feftment,
<PB N="140" REF="153">
while the &s;ucce&s;s of his reduction re|mains
uncertain: and it is hard upon the defend|ant
to &s;ubmit to the pur&s;uer's infeftment, when
he is ready to &s;hew, that the land belongs to him,
and that the pur&s;uer has no right. At the &s;ame
time, where a decree of adjudication is the pur|&s;uer's
title, an ab&s;olvitor is not le&s;s effectual a|gain&s;t
him and his heirs, than if he had been in|feft.
A decree of adjudication accordingly has
been &s;u&s;tained of late years, as an equitable title
for challenging every infeftment of the land ad|judged.</P>

<P>IN a proce&s;s for payment again&s;t an Engli&s;h|man
re&s;ient in England, who was cited at
the market-cro&s;s of Edinburgh, pier and &s;hore of
Leith, it was in his behalf pleaded, That he was
not &s;ubjected to the juri&s;diction of the court, and
therefore that the proce&s;s could not be compe|tent
again&s;t him. An&s;wered, The per&s;on cited
has, or may have, effects in Scotland; and an
action mu&s;t be competent again&s;t him, in order
to attach &s;uch effects. Replied, Whatever be the
con&s;equence, no inconvenience will &s;upport a pro|ce&s;s
before an incompetent court. At the &s;ame
time there is no occa&s;ion to proceed &s;o irregu|larly:
foreign effects locally in Scotland, are
&s;ubjected to the courts of Scotland, though the
proprietor be not; and by a real action, may be
adjudged, or made forthcoming to a creditor for
his payment.</P>
<P>More particularly, moveables locally in Scotland,
to whomever belonging, are &s;ubject to our courts
of law, and at their di&s;po&s;al. A court will li&s;ten
to a claimant &s;etting forth, &startq;That his debtor is a
foreigner, not within the juri&s;diction of the
court; but that certain effects of his, &s;pecified,
<PB N="142" REF="155">
happen to be within the juri&s;diction; and pray|ing,
that the&s;e effects may be adjudged to him
for his payment.&endq; To that end, the claimant
is admitted to prove the debt, whether by writ or
witne&s;&s;es. He may even have the benefit of the
foreigner's oath, upon proper notice being given;
and if the foreigner neither appear per&s;onally,
nor grant a mandate to enter an appearance for
him, he is ju&s;tly held as confe&s;&s;ing the verity
of the debt. The debt being thus a&s;certained,
a decree is pronounced, not again&s;t the debtor,
but again&s;t the effects &s;pecified in the claim, or|dering
them to be &s;old for the claimant's pay|ment;
the &s;urplus, if any be, to remain <HI>in ma|nibus
curiae</HI> for the u&s;e of the debtor. Very
different is a proce&s;s for payment again&s;t a per|&s;on
&s;ubject to the juri&s;diction of the court. The
juri&s;diction &s;upports the per&s;onal citation: the ci|tation
&s;upports the decree again&s;t the defend|ant;

<P>With re&s;pect to a proce&s;s to make forthcoming
foreign moveables to a creditor, an arre&s;tment of
the moveables is commonly the fir&s;t &s;tep; becau&s;e it
detains the moveables within the juri&s;diction of the
court from which the arre&s;tment i&s;&s;ues; and upon
that circum&s;tance all depends. The proce&s;s of ad|judication
or forthcoming follows; and if the judge
upon evidence be &s;atisfied that the claim is ju&s;t,
<PB N="143" REF="156">
he decrees the&s;e moveables to be made forthcoming
to the claimant for his payment. And this con|cludes
the proce&s;s; for there can be no decree a|gain&s;t
a man who is not &s;ubjected to the juri&s;dic|tion
of the court.</P>
<P>It remains only to be ob&s;erved, that the arre&s;t|ment,
though termed <HI>arre&s;tum juri&s;dictionis
fundandae gratia,</HI> is not the foundation of the
juri&s;diction: on the contrary, it implies a juri&s;|diction
already founded; as neither an arre&s;tment
nor any other diligence can proceed but by autho|rity
of a court having juri&s;diction. The local &s;i|tuation
of the effects within the territory of the
judge, founds his juri&s;diction over the effects,
though not over the per&s;on of the proprietor. It
is by virtue of his juri&s;diction, that he grants
warrant for the arre&s;tment; and the arre&s;tment is
of no other u&s;e but to detain the goods within the
territory. It is indeed a &s;tep that a cautious man
will not omit; but the claim is well founded with|out
it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Liti&s;conte&s;tation.</HEAD>
<P>WHile judges were arbiters merely, which
was their condition originally, liti&s;conte|&s;tation
was in reality a judicial contract; and the
decree differed not from a decreet-arbitral<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 1.</NOTE>.
Juri&s;diction arrived at greater perfection in cour&s;e
of time: Judges were e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;ove|reign,
to determine differences between parties,
with power to compel obedience. Con&s;ent was
no longer nece&s;&s;ary; and liti&s;conte&s;tation cea&s;ed
to be a judicial contract. Lawyers call it now a
<HI>qua&s;i-contract;</HI> a term approaching to a contract
in &s;ound, but far di&s;tant from it in meaning, if it
have any meaning.</P>
<P>Nothing is more common in law, than effects
kept up after their cau&s;es have cea&s;ed. There
are accordingly regulations both in England and
Scotland, built evidently on the &s;uppo&s;ition of li|ti&s;conte&s;tation
being a contract, as it was origi|nally.
In the Engli&s;h form of proce&s;s, if i&s;&s;ue be
joined even on the &s;lighte&s;t dilatory defence, it
concludes the cau&s;e. The defendant, &s;ucceeding
in his proof, is ab&s;olved: if he fail in his proof,
&s;entence pa&s;&s;es again&s;t him, without permitting
<PB N="145" REF="158">
him to plead any other defence, peremptory or
dilatory. This cannot be explained upon any
principle, other than that liti&s;conte&s;tation is a con|tract,
binding the parties that the proof &s;hall de|termine
the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>There are regulations of the &s;ame kind in Scot|land.
Take the following in&s;tance. In a proce&s;s
on the pa&s;&s;ive titles for payment of debt, the de|fendant,
aware that the &s;tating peremptory defen|ces
would be a virtual acknowledgement of the
pa&s;&s;ive titles, keeps the&s;e in re&s;erve, and betakes
him&s;elf to a denial of the pa&s;&s;ive titles. The pur|&s;uer
offers a proof of them: i&s;&s;ue is joined, the
pa&s;&s;ive titles are proved; and a decree for pay|ment
pa&s;&s;es of cour&s;e. The defendant applies to
the court again&s;t the judgement of the Ordinary,
and prays to be reponed to his peremptory de|fences.
The an&s;wer commonly made, is, &startq;That
the decree is regular; becau&s;e liti&s;conte&s;tation
is a judicial contract, implying the defendant's
con&s;ent to pay the debt, if the pa&s;&s;ive titles
&s;hall be proved again&s;t him; that the defend|ant
may in equity be reponed, upon paying
the expence of the act; but that he mu&s;t be
confined to an in&s;tant verification of his per|emptory
defences, without being allowed a
new term for proving, as there cannot be two
acts of liti&s;conte&s;tation in the &s;ame cau&s;e.&endq;
The practice accordingly is, to repone the de|fendant
to his peremptory defences, con$ining
<PB N="146" REF="159">
him to an in&s;tant verification of them, and ma|king
him pay the expence of the act. This is
obviou&s;ly a remnant of our old law, and a regu|lar
proceeding when liti&s;conte&s;tation was really
a contract. But now that it has cea&s;ed to be a
contract, the defendant ought not to be barred,
either at common law or equity, from proving his
defences one after another. Why &s;hould he be
reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of joining i&s;&s;ue on the
pa&s;&s;ive titles, and of lo&s;ing his cau&s;e if the pa&s;|&s;ive
titles be proved? Why not permit him to
plead, that though he is found liable for his pre|dece&s;&s;or's
debts, yet that he has certain good
exceptions again&s;t the debt claimed? What has
he done to bar him from in&s;i&s;ting on any excep|tions
that he cannot in&s;tantly verify? And why
&s;hould he be &s;ubjected to the expence of the act?
Here is obviou&s;ly a hovering between the old and
the new law; the former not totally laid a&s;ide,
nor the latter totally adopted.</P>
<P>With regard to form, there could not indeed
be two acts of liti&s;conte&s;tation, when the joining
i&s;&s;ue on any fact implied a mutual con&s;ent that
the proof &s;hould conclude the cau&s;e. But as ju|ri&s;diction
at pre&s;ent requires no con&s;ent, I &s;ee no
ab&s;urdity in a plurality of liti&s;conte&s;tations. They
are hurtful, it is true, by &s;welling the expence,
and prolonging the proce&s;s; but the&s;e inconve|niencies
may be prevented, by a regulation that
all the defences &s;hall be &s;tated at the beginning of
<PB N="147" REF="160">
the cau&s;e, and that one act of liti&s;conte&s;tation
&s;hall be pronounced upon &s;uch of them as require
proof. And where the defendant &s;tates his per|emptory
defences by order of the court, his obe|dience
to that order cannot infer an acknowledge|ment
of the pa&s;&s;ive titles.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Whether action can be &s;u&s;tained to make
effectual a &s;muggling-contract.</HEAD>
<P>BY 11th George I. cap. 30. &s;ect. 8. &startq;No tea
&s;hall be imported into this kingdom from
any place but that of its growth, on pain of
forfeiture.&endq;</P>
<P>If it be unlawful to import tea except from
the place of its growth, no man can be bound
by a contract to import it. The contract is null
and void, as all contracts are that bind one to
tran&s;gre&s;s the law. There is another objection,
ari&s;ing from the very nature of a court of ju&s;tice.
Courts of ju&s;tice are in&s;tituted, to enforce laws
natural and municipal, not to overturn them.
But to &s;u&s;tain action on &s;uch a contract, would be
to act in defiance of law: it would be a breach of
tru&s;t, of the &s;ame nature, though not the &s;ame in
degree, as to &s;u&s;tain action for a bribe to commit
murder or robbery.</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning has prevailed on the judges of
the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, to deny action to natives up|on
&s;muggling-contracts. But with re&s;pect to fo|reigners,
who are not bound by the laws of Bri|tain,
it continues to be a doubt, whether action
can ju&s;tly be denied to them. For removing
<PB N="149" REF="162">
that doubt, the following con&s;iderations are &s;ug|ge&s;ted.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, It is the privilege of every
&s;tate to regulate matters within its own territory.
The legi&s;lature may, in particular, prohibit cer|tain
goods to be imported, whether by natives or
by foreigners, under certain penalties; which ob|liges
every merchant to inform him&s;elf of the
commercial laws of the foreign countries in which
he traffics. If he go per&s;onally into a foreign
country, he is &s;ubjected to its laws; and if he
&s;end goods there, they are equally &s;ubjected. Fo|reigners
undoubtedly mu&s;t &s;ubmit them&s;elves to
the laws of this country, as far as they act within
it.</P>
<P>Secondly, The law of nations, re&s;pecting the
municipal laws of every country, declares it an
act of inju&s;tice in a foreigner to attempt any vio|lation
of them. It is wrong in a foreigner to fo|ment
a rebellion in Britain, though he never &s;et
foot in it; and it is equally wrong in him to hire
a per&s;on to commit murder in Britain. What
&s;hould be his puni&s;hment when found in this
kingdom, is not clearly e&s;tabli&s;hed by the law of
nations; but that he merits &s;ome puni&s;hment,
will not be controverted. And it clearly follows,
that action ought not to be &s;u&s;tained to him here,
if he &s;hould think of claiming performance of a|ny
covenant relative to the wrong done. This
mu&s;t al&s;o hold, where he knowingly tran&s;gre&s;&s;es
<PB N="150" REF="163">
any law purely municipal, &s;uch as the &s;muggling
prohibited goods into Britain, or the being acce&s;|&s;ory
to the &s;muggling.</P>
<P>And now more directly to the &s;tatute under
con&s;ideration. It is imper&s;onally conceived, &startq;That
no tea &s;hall be imported into this kingdom but
from the place of its growth.&endq; Here no di&s;|tinction
of per&s;ons is made: the prohibition
reaches every per&s;on, native of foreigner. If a
Gottenburg merchant &s;end a cargo of tea to his
corre&s;pondent in Britain, to be &s;old for his behoof,
the cargo is lawful &s;eizure by &s;tatute; and is ac|cordingly
condemned in exchequer, of which we
have daily in&s;tances. The cargo, till it be &s;old,
continues to be the property of the Gottenburg
merchant; and as no man can be forfeited of
his property who has committed no delict, it
mu&s;t be admitted, if our law be ju&s;t, that the fo|reign
merchant has been guilty of a delict in land|ing
his prohibited goods here. And that it is a
delict by the law of nations, is made evident a|bove.</P>
<P>If the actual landing the cargo here be crimi|nal,
a commi&s;&s;ion by the foreign merchant to his
factor here for &s;muggling the cargo, cannot be
innocent. It is wrong in &s;everal views: fir&s;t, as
a means to an unlawful end; and, next, as an
acce&s;&s;ion to a crime, intended to be committed by
a native; for that the native is criminal, no per|&s;on
doubts. It follows, that the factor is not
<PB N="151" REF="164">
bound to fulfil the unlawful commi&s;&s;ion; and
that no action ought to be &s;u&s;tained again&s;t him
for damages.</P>
<P>I put another ca&s;e. A merchant in Scotland
commi&s;&s;ions a quantity of tea from a merchant in
Gottenburg. Ought action to be &s;u&s;tained to the
latter again&s;t the former, for the price of the tea
&s;ent and received? This que&s;tion will receive
different an&s;wers in different circum&s;tances. A
commi&s;&s;ion for tea to be delivered to a &s;hipma&s;ter
named, without &s;pecifying the de&s;tination of the
ve&s;&s;el, is lawful; and the foreign merchant ought
to have action here, without being obliged to &s;ay
or to know what has become of the cargo. If it
have been &s;muggled into Scotland by the Scotch
merchant, his Gottenburg corre&s;pondent, who
had no acce&s;&s;ion to the wrong, is not an&s;werable.
But where the Gottenburg merchant is informed
of his corre&s;pondent's intention to &s;muggle, and
takes mea&s;ures accordingly for concealment, the
contract is unlawful on both &s;ides. It is admitted
to be unlawful as to the Scotch merchant; and it
is unlawful as to the other in a double re&s;pect;
fir&s;t, as violating the laws of Britain; and, next,
as an acce&s;&s;ion to the crime of the Scotch mer|chant.
And our judges would be acce&s;&s;ory to the
crime, if they &s;hould &s;u&s;tain action upon it. Here
the rule is applicable, That <HI>in turpi cau&s;a potior
e&s;t conditio po&s;&s;identis.</HI> The ca&s;e is in effect the
&s;ame, where the goods are commi&s;&s;ioned to be
<PB N="152" REF="165">
imported into Britain, without mentioning that
they are intended to be &s;muggled. For the fo|reign
merchant knows, or ought to know, that they
cannot be imported otherwi&s;e than by &s;muggling.</P>
<P>For illu&s;trating this doctrine, I put a &s;imilar
ca&s;e. In the year 1745, a number of Scotch re|bels
commi&s;&s;ion from a merchant in Rotterdam a
cargo of powder, ball, and other warlike &s;tores,
which he furni&s;hes, knowing of the rebellion;
and after the rebellion is qua&s;hed, he brings his
action in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion for the price. Would
a Briti&s;h court &s;u&s;tain &s;uch an action? They
would be acce&s;&s;ory to the wrong, if they did.
Common &s;en&s;e mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t to the foreign mer|chant,
that he who knowingly tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the law
of Britain, cannot expect the aid of that law to
make his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion beneficial to him. We de|ny
the benefit of our courts of ju&s;tice to a nation
at war with us, however innocent the per&s;on may
be who brings the action. Is it not &s;till more rea|&s;onable
to deny that benefit to a foreigner, who
is not innocent, but has knowingly contemned
our law?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e now the foreigner to have been igno|rant
of the law prohibiting tea to be imported but
from the place of its growth. Will this intitle
him to an action for the price? I an&s;wer, that it
will not intitle him, more than it will intitle him
to the tea it&s;elf &s;eized in Scotland. It was his
duty to have been better informed; and no man
<PB N="153" REF="166">
can avail him&s;elf of culpable ignorance. But
&s;uppo&s;ing his ignorance to be excu&s;able, yet &s;uch
ignorance can only relieve from puni&s;hment: it
will not relieve a man even from damages; far
le&s;s will it intitle him to an action in contradiction
to the law of the land. To reward ignorance
with a privilege that knowledge is not intitled to,
would indeed be extremely Gothic.</P>
<P>I conclude with a &s;eparate con&s;ideration. For
performance of a &s;muggling-contract, action is
not &s;u&s;tained to a native again&s;t a foreigner; and
it would be incon&s;i&s;tent with the rules of equity,
to &s;u&s;tain action to the latter again&s;t the former.</P>

<P>In the tract quoted, it is laid down, that before
the art of writing was common, a writ was vouch|ed
by the &s;eal of the granter; and that if he ac|knowledged

denied the &s;eal to be his, or <HI>quod non
e&s;t factum,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ed in England; the plain|tiff
was burdened with proving, that it was the
defendant's &s;eal. This fact being proved, the
&s;ealing was pre&s;umed to be the operation of the
defendant; unle&s;s he could bring po&s;itive evi|dence,
<PB N="155" REF="168">
that the &s;eal was &s;tolen from him, and ap|plied
by another hand.</P>
<P>The &s;tatute 117. parl. 1540, on a preamble
that a &s;eal may be lo&s;t or forged, enacts, &startq;That
in time coming, no faith be given to any wri|ting
under &s;eal, without &s;ub&s;cription of the par|ty.&endq;
Here, the acknowledging the &s;ub&s;crip|tion
vouches the deed, as the acknowledging the
&s;eal did formerly. And it al&s;o bani&s;hes all &s;u&s;pi|cion
of fal&s;ehood, as a man's &s;u&s;cription cannot
be &s;tolen, though his &s;eal may.</P>
<P>An explicit acknowledgement of the &s;eal or
&s;ub&s;cription, is not requi&s;ite to found a decree.
An implied acknowledgement is &s;ufficient, im|plied
from pleading other defences, and forbear|ing
to plead <HI>quod non e&s;t factum.</HI> But as a &s;eal
at a writ is no evidence that the impre&s;&s;ion was
made by the &s;eal of the defendant; &s;o the letters
of the defendant's name at the foot make not e|vidence
that the &s;ub&s;cription is his: the objection
<HI>quod non e&s;t factum</HI> is competent equally in both
ca&s;es; and the objection is a negative, which
burdens the plaintiff with proving the &s;ub&s;cription
to be the defendant's. Thus in a proce&s;s again&s;t
me for payment of the &s;um in a bill of exchange
or promi&s;&s;ory note, the letters of my name at the
foot afford not evidence that the &s;ub&s;cription is
mine; and for that rea&s;on, I am admitted to
plead <HI>quod non e&s;t factum.</HI> So far the law of
England and of Scotland are the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="169">
The law of England admits not a decree in ab|&s;ence.
In Scotland, a decree in ab&s;ence is effec|tual;
and &s;uch a decree, founded even on a bill
of exchange, or on a promi&s;&s;ory note, may be
carried to execution. From the defendant's de|clining
to appear, the &s;ub&s;cription at the bill or
promi&s;&s;ory note, is pre&s;umed to be his.</P>
<P>The law of England continues the &s;ame to this
day, with re&s;pect to every &s;ort of writ, excepting
a bond in judgement, where it is a rule, That
matters of record prove them&s;elves, and admit not
any averment again&s;t them<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">New Abridgement of the law, vol. 2. p. 306.</NOTE>. But in Scotland,
the act 1681, requiring witne&s;&s;es to &s;ub&s;cribe, has
produced an alteration. The &s;ub&s;criptions of the
witne&s;&s;es vouch the &s;ub&s;cription of the party;
which bars him from pleading, <HI>Non e&s;t factum,</HI>
and obliges him to undertake a proof that the
writ is forged. But this alteration takes place on|ly
in writs that require witne&s;&s;es. Other writs,
&s;uch as bills and promi&s;&s;ory notes, &s;tand on their
original footing.</P>
<P>A difference takes place in our practice, be|tween
a writ having a clau&s;e of regi&s;tration, and
a writ requiring witne&s;&s;es, but not having a clau&s;e
of regi&s;tration. The former cannot be challen|ged
but in a regular proce&s;s of improbation; but
again&s;t the latter improbation may be proponed
as an exception<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, book 4. tit. 4. &s;ect. 39. 40.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="170">
Of writs that require not witne&s;&s;es, &s;everal are
probative <HI>per &s;e;</HI> and admit not the defence of
<HI>Non e&s;t factum,</HI> more than when there are &s;ub&s;cri|bing
witne&s;&s;es. A holograph writ is one of the&s;e:
it is pre&s;umed to be genuine from the difficulty
of forging a writ of any length; and to overturn
that pre&s;umption, a proof of forgery is required.
The party's &s;ub&s;cription to an account of furni&s;h|ings
is another in&s;tance; the &s;ub&s;cription being
fortified by the account. A receipt of rent by a
landlord to his tenant, is a third in&s;tance. That
it is the landlord's &s;ub&s;cription, is vouched by
&s;everal collateral circum&s;tances, the extent of the
rent due, the known term of payment, and the
practice of paying regularly. I &s;hall add but one
in&s;tance more, which is, a mi&s;&s;ive letter, e&s;pecially

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Qualified oath.</HEAD>
<P>WHen in a proce&s;s a fact is referred to the
oath of the pur&s;uer or defendant, he who
gives the oath may have occa&s;ion to qualify it by
the addition of circum&s;tances. Where the cir|cum&s;tances
added are intimately connected with
the fact acknowledged, &s;o as to require no proof
but the oath it&s;elf, they are termed <HI>intrin&s;ic qua|lities:</HI>
where they require other proof, they are
termed <HI>extrin&s;ic qualities.</HI> The following con&s;i|derations
may tend to explain the difference.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Where the libel is referred to the oath
of the defendant, every fact or circum&s;tance men|tioned
in the oath that re&s;olves into a denial of the
libel, is intrin&s;ic; becau&s;e, if the libel be not pro|ved,
an ab&s;olvitor follows.</P>
<P>Second, Whatever is a proper cro&s;s interroga|tory
to a witne&s;s, may be added by the defend|ant
to his oath. For had the pur&s;uer taken a
proof by witne&s;&s;es, it would have been compe|tent
to the defendant to put cro&s;s interrogatories;
and he mu&s;t not be cut out of his privilege by
being cho&s;en as the only witne&s;s.</P>
<P>Third, If an agreement be referred to the oath
of the defendant, every circum&s;tance is intrin|&s;ic
<PB N="159" REF="172">
that imports it to have been altered, or pa&s;&s;ed

fulfilled, and brought to its final conclu&s;ion, no
after alteration adjected to the oath is intrin&s;ic.
Thus, where a bargain for a hor&s;e, with delivery,
is referred to the defendant's oath, in order to
recover the price, if the bargain and delivery be
acknowledged, which fulfil the bargain on the
pur&s;uer's part, an addition to the oath, that the
bargain was afterward pa&s;&s;ed from, and the hor&s;e
redelivered, is not <HI>pars eju&s;dem negotii,</HI> but
mu&s;t be proved otherwi&s;e than by the oath.</P>
<P>Fourth, If the libel be not relevant as laid, the
defendant may either object to the relevancy, and
refu&s;e to depone; or he may add circum&s;tances
to his oath, that re&s;olve in a denial of the libel as
it ought to have been laid; and the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces
will be intrin&s;ic.</P>
<P>Fifth, Where a defendant has exceptions a|gain&s;t
a relevant libel referred to his oath, he
ought to &s;tate the&s;e exceptions before deponing,
in order that the pur&s;uer may take another mean
of proof, if he be unwilling that the exception
&s;hould be proved by the defendant's oath, as well
as the libel. See act of &s;ederunt, 7th Decem|ber
1613. From this act we learn, that if the
defendant be permitted to depone after &s;tating
his exceptions, and in&s;ert the&s;e exceptions in his
oath, they will be held as intrin&s;ic. But if <HI>re&s;t|ing
<PB N="160" REF="173">
owing</HI> &s;imply be referred to oath, there is no
need beforehand to &s;tate any exception &s;ubver&s;ive
of the debt, payment, for example, or innova|tion.
For as the defendant is at liberty to deny
<HI>re&s;ting owing</HI> &s;imply, he is at liberty to mention
in his oath, the facts that prove the debt not to
be <HI>re&s;ting owing.</HI> Here a difference is made in
our dici&s;ions, between extingui&s;hing the debt by
payment in money, and extingui&s;hing it by deli|vering
goods in &s;atisfaction. The latter is not
&s;u&s;tained as intrin&s;ic; for what good rea&s;on, I have
not di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Sixth, If the defendant add to his oath an ex|ception
that is not competent to be proved by
witne&s;&s;es, it will be rejected as extrin&s;ic. Ex|ample:
A bond of borrowed money being lo&s;t,
the debt is referred to the defendant's oath. An
addition to the oath, That the debt was paid, is
not intrin&s;ic. For he cannot prove, by his own
oath, what is not competent for him to prove by
witne&s;&s;es; and if he neglected to take a written
document of the payment, he has nothing left
for proof but the pur&s;uer's oath. But the fol|lowing
addition will be intrin&s;ic, That the bond
was not lo&s;t, but delivered up to him the defend|ant
upon payment. The like in a forthcoming at
the in&s;tance of an arre&s;ter, who refers the debt to
the oath of the arre&s;tee, becau&s;e he is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed
of the bond.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="174">
The foregoing rules are al&s;o, in a good mea|&s;ure,
applicable for determining the difference be|tween
intrin&s;ic and extrin&s;ic qualities, in an oath
emitted by the pur&s;uer upon a reference by the
defendant.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Evidence with re&s;pect to deathbed.</HEAD>
<P>PRoperty originally included not a power to a|lien,
but only to u&s;e and enjoy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 3.</NOTE>. But as
this was a re&s;traint again&s;t nature, it crept in gra|dually,

of his heritage for nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;es<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Reg. Maj. l. 2. cap. 18.</NOTE>. At
the &s;ame time, this innovation was permitted with
&s;o great re&s;erve, that &s;uch a deed was not &s;u&s;|tained,
if executed in deadly &s;ickne&s;s, as the law
expre&s;&s;es it, or on deathbed. &startq;Where a man
in deadly &s;ickne&s;s makes an alienation, which
in health he did not think of, the &s;ame is pre|&s;umed
to be done through trouble of mind,
and not deliberately<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">&sect; 9. of the law above quoted.</NOTE>.&endq; Liberty to di&s;po&s;e
of a part for nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;es, was enlarged
by degrees, till it became law, that property
includes a power of alienation, and that it may
be di&s;po&s;ed of without any cau&s;e but the will
of the proprietor. In every &s;tep however that
extended property, the prohibition of aliening in
deadly &s;ickne&s;s, or on deathbed, continued inva|riable.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="176">
It may be doubted here, whether it be the in|tention
of the law, to bind up the hands of a
man on deathbed from making any deed, how|ever
&s;ound of mind, or however rational the deed
may be; or whether it be only the intention of
the law, to infer a pre&s;umption, that the deed was
done <HI>through trouble of mind, and not delibe|rately.</HI>
Upon the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, the deed is
<HI>ip&s;o jure</HI> null, as if done by an infant, or by a
man in a delirium. Upon the other &s;uppo&s;ition,
the deed being granted by one who has power of
alienation, mu&s;t be effectual again&s;t all the world,
except again&s;t the heir, who can challenge the
deed as done through trouble of mind, and not
deliberately.</P>
<P>That the law of deathbed infers only a ground
of reduction, will be evident from the following
con&s;iderations. 1&s;t, That no per&s;on is intitled to
challenge a deathbed-deed except the heir, is an
e&s;tabli&s;hed rule; and it is equally e&s;tabli&s;hed,
that the heir is barred from the challenge by the
negative pre&s;cription of forty years. My next
authority is drawn from a ca&s;e ob&s;erved by Had|dington,
3d December 1608, Gilbert Supplicant.
The ca&s;e was this: A man bedfa&s;t with the gout,
finding it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ell land for payment of
debt, and fearing that people would &s;cruple to
deal with him in that condition; the court, on
his &s;upplication, directed &s;ome of their number
to vi&s;it him; and they reporting, that though he
<PB N="164" REF="177">
could not u&s;e his limbs, his memory and judge|ment
were entire; the judges declared, that the
alienation to be made by him &s;hould not be redu|cible
<HI>ex capite lecti.</HI> This was a &s;ingular ca&s;e,
which &s;howed the &s;en&s;e of the court in the &s;trong|e&s;t
manner, that deathbed infers only a pre&s;ump|tion
of weakne&s;s of mind, which mu&s;t yield to a
direct proof of the contrary; and the proof in
this ca&s;e &s;atisfied all the judges.</P>
<P>It is extremely right, that a man on deathbed,
like a minor, or a per&s;on fatuous, &s;hould be under
the protection of the law, to &s;ecure him again&s;t
de&s;igning per&s;ons, who would lay hold of his
weakne&s;s to make him do what he would abhor
in found health; but if this protection were car|ried
&s;o far, as to cut down every deed done on
deathbed, without regard to circum&s;tances, it
might occa&s;ion much wrong, without any &s;ub|&s;tantial
good. I in&s;tance intermitting di&s;ea&s;es,
where a man is well and ill by turns, the ague,
the gravel, the gout, the a&s;thma, &amp;c. In the
cour&s;e of an ague, a man makes a deed in the
intermitting day, in perfect health, and &s;oundne&s;s
of mind. But the ague wears him out, and he
dies unexpectedly within three&s;core days. He
happens not to go to kirk or market; but in his
intermitting days, he goes abroad, is acce&s;&s;ible
to all the world, and follows out his ordinary oc|cupations,
as before he was &s;eized with the di&s;|ea&s;e.
It would be unrea&s;onable to forbid a proof
<PB N="165" REF="178">
by un&s;u&s;pected witne&s;&s;es, that he was of found
judgement when he made the deed. This rea|&s;oning
is equally applicable to the other di&s;ea&s;es
mentioned.</P>
<P>Taking it now for granted, that the law of
deathbed infers a pre&s;umption only, which may
be redargued by a proof to the contrary, the
next que&s;tion is, What proof is &s;ufficient? I ob|&s;erve
with &s;atisfaction, that our law is ju&s;tly &s;u&s;|picious
of acts of reconvale&s;cence alledged to be
done <HI>intra parietes,</HI> offered to be proved by no
witne&s;&s;es but tho&s;e that are cho&s;en by the grant|er,
or by tho&s;e having undue influence over him,
all other per&s;ons being kept at a di&s;tance. Craig<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">l. 1. dieg. 13. &sect; 36.</NOTE>
handles this point with accuracy. After ob&s;er|ving,
that it is only called <HI>lectus aegritudinis</HI>
where the di&s;ea&s;e proves mortal; he lays it
down, that if the granters recover &s;o as to go to
church, to market, or to other public place, he
is held not to have been <HI>in lecto aegritudinis.</HI>
But what, &s;ays he, if the granter be in &s;uch a
condition as not to be able to go abroad? He
informs us, that &s;ome were of opinion, that a
proof of the granter's being in &s;ound judgement
would &s;upport the deed; and adds, that different
judgements had been given upon that point in
the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. He gives his opinion again&s;t
&s;uch a proof; becau&s;e, &s;ays he, where a man
<PB N="166" REF="179">
confined to the hou&s;e makes an irrational deed,
it is pre&s;umed to have been the effect of undue
influence, which men are &s;ubject to at the la&s;t
&s;tage of life, though they may otherwi&s;e be <HI>&s;anae
mentis;</HI> and that it would be un&s;afe to tru&s;t wit|ne&s;&s;es
who are cho&s;en by the man him&s;elf, or by his
advi&s;ers. This opinion has ju&s;tly prevailed in our
practice: Durie, 1&s;t February 1622, Robert&s;on
<HI>contra</HI> Fleming; Durie, 7th January 1724,
Shaw <HI>contra</HI> Gray; Durie, penult July 1636,

In this la&s;t ca&s;e, it is ob&s;erved by the
Collector, that &startq;equipollent acts are not to be
&s;u&s;tained, unle&s;s having the e&s;&s;ential qualities
of being at kirk and market, viz. their being
performed before many indifferent witne&s;&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>But where acts are done publicly, in pre&s;ence
of un&s;u&s;pected witne&s;&s;es, a proof of reconvale&s;|cence
is always admitted. Craig, in the pa&s;&s;age
above cited, is of that opinion; and that opinion is
followed in our practice. The following qualifica|tions
to bar a reduction <HI>ex capite lecti</HI> were admit|ted
to proof, viz. That the di&s;poner, &s;everal weeks
after the di&s;po&s;ition, had &s;itten in his &s;hop, and
&s;old his goods; and that he had walked before his
&s;hop-door, and bought a &s;uit of cloaths in the
next &s;hop; &s;eeing that, being a Quaker, he did
not go to church: Harcus (<HI>Lectus aegritudinis</HI>),
<PB N="167" REF="180">
February 1683, Living&s;ton <HI>contra</HI> Goodale. The
following acts to prove reconvale&s;cence, were &s;u&s;|tained
equivalent to the going to kirk or market,
viz. the going from Edinburgh to Inverkeithing
to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the election of a commi&s;&s;ioner to par|liament,
&s;pending the whole day in a boat at &s;ea
for diver&s;ion, walking in the Lady Home's gar|den,
and vi&s;iting pri&s;oners in the tolbooth; Foun|tainhall,
21&s;t February 1694, Tillicheuen <HI>contra</HI>
Innermaith.</P>
<P>It will illu&s;trate this doctrine, to compare a di&s;|po&s;ition
of moveables upon deathbed, with that
of land in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. Excepting
arms and hor&s;es for war, our moveables in an|cient
times were of very little value; and men
were permitted to di&s;po&s;e of them at plea&s;ure.
A di&s;po&s;ition therefore of moveables on death|bed
is &s;u&s;tained: no objection lies again&s;t it, ex|cept
that the granter was not <HI>compos mentis.</HI>
A di&s;po&s;ition of land on deathbed is very differ|ent.
It is pre&s;umed, that the granter was not of
a di&s;po&s;ing mind; and reduction follows, un|le&s;s
it can be proved, that he was of &s;ound judge|ment.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the ca&s;es that belong to the law of
deathbed, terminate in pre&s;umptions that can be
redargued by a proof to the contrary. In our
old practice, the law of deathbed was frequently
applied to cut down deeds granted years before
death. This latitude was corrected by act 4.
<PB N="168" REF="181">
parl. 1696, barring reduction where a man lives
three&s;core days after the deed challenged, though
he neither go to church nor market. The in|tendment
of this &s;tatute, is to infer a pre&s;umption
of reconvale&s;cence, if the maker of the deed live
&s;ixty days after it. But it admits this pre&s;ump|tion
to be redargued, by a proof that the man
was not &s;ound in judgement when he made the
deed. Does it not follow from the&s;e premi&s;es,
that though he die within &s;ixty days, yet the deed
ought to be &s;u&s;tained, if it can be proved by un|&s;u&s;pected
witne&s;&s;es, that he was of &s;ound judge|ment
when it was made? It would be a &s;trange
partiality, to admit a proof for redarguing the
pre&s;umption of reconvale&s;cence, where the grant|er
lives three&s;core days; and yet to forbid a proof
for redarguing the pre&s;umption of the granter's
being un&s;ound in judgement, where he dies with|in
the three&s;core days. The pre&s;umption of re|convale&s;cence
from going to kirk or market, falls
under the &s;ame plan of evidence. Lunatics are
attacked with fits of delirium at intervals. An
irrational deed is made in one of the&s;e fits; and
when the granter returns to his &s;en&s;es, he has no
memory of what he has done. In his intervals
he goes both to kirk and market as u&s;ual, but
dies withing three&s;core days. The going to kirk
or market &s;upports the irrational deed, upon the
pre&s;umption of reconvale&s;cence. It will however
not be doubted, that this pre&s;umption may be
<PB N="169" REF="182">
redargued by an offer to prove, that the man
was actually in a delirium when the deed was
made.</P>
<P>A &s;ingular ca&s;e of deathbed is a gradual decay
of nature from old age, where a man, without
any di&s;ea&s;e, turns weaker and weaker, till the
lamp of life be extingui&s;hed. This ca&s;e may be
attended with various circum&s;tances. Sometimes
the mind wears out before the body, which was
the ca&s;e of the great Duke of Marlborough: they
often wear out together. But the mo&s;t ordinary
ca&s;e is, that the bodily faculties are at the lowe&s;t
&s;tate, while tho&s;e of the mind are entire, though
le&s;s vigorous than in the meridian of life. A man
in this condition makes a rational deed, and dies
within three&s;core days. It cannot be &s;aid, that
he was on deathbed; for it is &s;uppo&s;ed that he
was going about, and attending his affairs, as
u&s;ual, &s;pending no more time in bed than nece&s;|&s;ary
for the ordinary recruit of &s;leep. A decay
of nature commences commonly years before it
end in death: where &s;hall we fix the commence|ment
of deathbed? But without going nicely or
&s;trictly to work, it mu&s;t be admitted, that a man
in the la&s;t &s;tage of life, though afflicted with no
di&s;ea&s;e, is more liable to &s;eduction than in vigour
of mind; and upon that account de&s;erves, like a
minor at lea&s;t, to be taken under the protection
of law. In this condition, the pre&s;umption that
he was not of a di&s;po&s;ing mind when the deed
<PB N="170" REF="183">
was granted, takes place; to redargue which, a
proof to the contrary ought to be admitted. And
con&s;idering how little influence, in many in&s;tan|ces,
old age has on the mental faculties, there is
not another ca&s;e, where a proof ought more
chearfully to be admitted by un&s;u&s;pected witne&s;&s;es,
for redarguing the pre&s;umption of weakne&s;s of
mind. A decay in a young man &s;eldom di&s;ables
him to go to kirk or market; which will defeat
a challenge on deathbed, though he die within
&s;ixty days. Now, the going to a kirk or a mar|ket,
is not, in common &s;en&s;e, &s;o pregnant evi|dence
of the granter's being entire in judgement,
as a proof by phy&s;icians, &s;urgeons, or other un|&s;u&s;pected
witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e la&s;t mentioned is that of Faichney.
He died of old age after a gradual decline, like a
lamp after the oil is &s;pent. Nor was his life a|bridged
a moment by any di&s;ea&s;e. His phy&s;ician
depones, indeed, that he was apprehen&s;ive of a
pal&s;y; but he was in a mi&s;take, for there was no
pal&s;y. Faichney was not be&s;et by any de&s;igning
per&s;ons, to bias him again&s;t what he thought
right. He was acce&s;&s;ible to all the world, none
being refu&s;ed acce&s;s to him. He went both to
church and market; perhaps &s;upported, for the
proof of that circum&s;tance is not clear. But his
going to kirk and market, is however evidence of
his not &s;hunning to &s;how him&s;elf publicly. He
certainly did not keep at home, in order that
<PB N="171" REF="184">
there might be no witne&s;s but of his own chu&s;ing.
The proof by his phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon, of his
being &s;ound in judgement when he granted the
deed challenged, is &s;atisfactory. Nor is their evi|dence
redargued by the witne&s;&s;es who depone,
that he looked pale and weakly, like a dying
man; becau&s;e that is frequently the ca&s;e of the
body, when the mind is entire. And la&s;tly, the
&s;ettlement challenged was a rational and pru|dent
deed, perhaps the mo&s;t prudent that could
be devi&s;ed by any man in Faichney's circum&s;tan|ces.
The deed, notwith&s;tanding, was, in July 1776,
reduced, as granted on deathbed. The judges
were aver&s;e to any argument that might weaken
the &s;alutary law of deathbed.</P>

as evidence; re&s;erving all objections again&s;t
the &s;ame, and re&s;erving al&s;o to both parties a re|examination
of the witne&s;&s;es that were alive. They
were al&s;o allowed to bring an additional proof, if
nece&s;&s;ary<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">15th December 1733, Captain Chalmers <HI>contra</HI> Sir James Cuningham.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But &s;uch a proof is not commonly &s;u&s;tained in
a new proce&s;s, where either the pur&s;uer or de|fendant
is different. And accordingly it is a rule,
That a proof by witne&s;&s;es of the pa&s;&s;ive title
<HI>ge&s;tio pro herede,</HI> or vicious intromi&s;&s;ion, is not
evidence in another proce&s;s at the in&s;tance of a
different pur&s;uer. Yet the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of depo|&s;itions
in this ca&s;e, &s;eems no le&s;s rational than
where both pur&s;uer and defendant are the &s;ame.
For if the pur&s;uer be &s;atisfied to join i&s;&s;ue upon
depo&s;itions taken in a proce&s;s where he was not
a party, the defendant, who was a party, ought
to have no objection; provided he be allowed to
object again&s;t the depo&s;itions, as again&s;t the wit|ne&s;&s;es
them&s;elves. And from a ca&s;e reported
<PB N="176" REF="189">
by Lord Stair<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">13th January 1675, Glendinning <HI>contra</HI> Earl Nith&s;|dale.</NOTE>, it appears, that this had been
frequently practi&s;ed. But the practice ought not
to be indulged, where the defendant is different;
it would be too wide a &s;tretch, to &s;u&s;tain depo&s;i|tions
again&s;t a party who had no opportunity to
put cro&s;s interrogatories to the witne&s;&s;es. Thus,
a decree proving the tenor of a bond again&s;t one
of the obligants, being produced as proof in a
proce&s;s of proving the tenor again&s;t the other obli|gant,
the pur&s;uer was not permitted to found up|on
his decree as evidence; which obliged him
to take a new proof<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Newbyth, 1&s;t February 1665, Broomhall <HI>contra</HI> Marquis of Douglas; Stair; Dirleton, 13th January 1675, Glendinning <HI>contra</HI> Earl Nith&s;dale.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve with regret, that the court has not al|ways
been &s;o cha&s;te. In a train of deci&s;ions it
has been found, that where the &s;uperior's right
is reduced, the decree is <HI>res judicata</HI> again&s;t his
va&s;&s;als, though not made parties in the proce&s;s.
And that a decreet of reduction of a tack, is e|qually
<HI>res judicata</HI> again&s;t &s;ubtenants<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dict. of Dec. <HI>Res inter alios,</HI> &s;ect. <HI>Res judicata.</HI></NOTE>. Where
a tack&s;man removes after his tack expires, whe|ther
voluntarily, or by a decree of removing, his
&s;ubtenants, who can have no pretext to continue
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, may be removed at &s;hort hand. But
&s;uppo&s;ing a tack to be reduced at the in&s;tance of
<PB N="177" REF="190">
the landlord upon fraud or other ground of re|duction,
<HI>Quaeritur,</HI> Can &s;ubtenants be removed at
&s;hort hand? If the tack&s;man had no power to
&s;ub&s;et, they may be &s;o removed; becau&s;e they
have no right to continue po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another
man's property again&s;t his will. But if the tack&s;|man
had a power to &s;ub&s;et, they cannot be &s;o re|moved:
they have a title to po&s;&s;e&s;s derived from
the landlord him&s;elf. The judgement again&s;t the
tack&s;man is <HI>res inter alios</HI> as to them. There mu&s;t
therefore be a new proce&s;s again&s;t the &s;ubtenants;
in which they will be admitted to &s;upport the
tack&s;man's right, notwith&s;tanding the <HI>res judica|ta</HI>
again&s;t him. And in this particular, &s;ubva&s;&s;als
are preci&s;ely &s;imilar to &s;ubtenants. Upon re|demption
of a wad&s;et, the wad&s;etter's tenants,
and al&s;o his feuers, may be removed <HI>brevi manu</HI>
at the next term. But &s;uppo&s;ing, that a man in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion upon a title of property, has created
feus, or other &s;ubaltern rights; a reduction of
his right by a per&s;on producing what appears to
be a preferable title, will not intitle that per&s;on
to turn out <HI>brevi manu</HI> tho&s;e who have &s;ubaltern
rights. A proce&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary again&s;t them, in
which they will be admitted to &s;upport the right
of their author. But is a reduction of the au|thor's
right effectual again&s;t a purcha&s;er, who has
only a di&s;po&s;ition, or a minute of &s;ale? The
doubt is, that a &s;ubtenant or &s;ubva&s;&s;al in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
is known, and may be made a party in the reduc|tion;
<PB N="178" REF="191">
which is not the ca&s;e of a di&s;ponee without
infeftment. But even here the maxim &s;tands
good, That a <HI>res judicata</HI> cannot affect third
parties. Nor is there any hard&s;hip: for the re|ducer,
by taking infeftment, acquires the civil po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the land; which will force the di&s;po|nee
to become pur&s;uer, if he have any pro&s;pect
to &s;upport his author's right.</P>
<P>A decree again&s;t the principal debtor, was of
old held to be <HI>res judicata</HI> again&s;t the cautioner;
as if <HI>res judicata</HI> were effectual again&s;t all the
world, like an act of parliament. But that opi|nion
wore away; and at pre&s;ent it is e&s;tabli&s;hed,
that a decree again&s;t the principal debtor, is not
<HI>res judicata</HI> again&s;t the cautioner, either as to re|levancy
or proof<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Forbes, 28th December 1709, Hamilton <HI>contra</HI> Calder.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Next in order come the effects of a decreet-ab&s;olvitor;
fir&s;t, with re&s;pect to a new proce&s;s be|tween
the &s;ame parties; and, next, where the
pur&s;uer or defendant is different. With re&s;pect
to a new proce&s;s between the &s;ame parties, an
ab&s;olvitor from defect of proof, mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
from an ab&s;olvitor from defect of relevan|cy.
Where the pur&s;uer fails in proving, it was
a rule in the Roman law, That he is not per|mitted
to renew the action, even on production of
a writ <HI>noviter veniens ad notitiam</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 35. De re judicata.</NOTE>. This
<PB N="179" REF="192">
rule is evidently a remnant of the old law, which
held a decree to be equivalent to a decreet-arbi|tral,
or a tran&s;action <HI>de re dubia,</HI> putting a
final end to the claim. But as a decree in our
pre&s;ent practice depends on the authority of the
judge, his authority is confined to the evidence
produced in the proce&s;s; and therefore cannot
bar a new production upon which the judge had
no opportunity to give an opinion. For that
rea&s;on, the court, in a new proce&s;s having the
&s;ame conclu&s;ion, admit writs <HI>noviter venientia ad
notitiam</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Stair, 22d June 1681, Paton <HI>contra</HI> Stirling.</NOTE>. The &s;ame rea&s;on, it is true, would
admit a new proof by witne&s;&s;es: but a more
weighty rea&s;on on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide excludes &s;uch
a proof, viz. the danger of &s;ubornation and per|jury.
Such a proof is not permitted even in the
&s;ame proce&s;s, except in very favourable circum|&s;tances
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dictionary, <HI>Proce&s;s,</HI> &s;ect. <HI>Incident diligence.</HI></NOTE>. As there is not the &s;ame danger,
where the facts offered to be proved are different
from what were formerly the &s;ubject of proof,
the court frequently gives way to a proof of &s;uch
facts in the &s;ame proce&s;s<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dictionary, <HI>Proce&s;s,</HI> &s;ect. <HI>Competent and omitted.</HI></NOTE>. But I know no
example of admitting &s;uch proof in a new proce&s;s.</P>
<P>We proceed to an ab&s;olvitor from a proce&s;s as
irrelevant. Such ab&s;olvitor will not bar a new
proce&s;s between the &s;ame parties, inferring the
<PB N="180" REF="193">
&s;ame conclu&s;ion from a different medium. Thus,
in a reduction of a di&s;po&s;ition on the act 1621,
the defence was, That an ab&s;olvitor had formerly
been pronounced again&s;t the pur&s;uer in a proce&s;s
for reducing the di&s;po&s;ition on the head of inhi|bition;
and that it would make law-&s;uits endle&s;s
to admit a new ground of reduction. The court
was of opinion, that <HI>competent and omitted</HI> bars
only the defendant, not the pur&s;uer, again&s;t
whom no &s;u&s;picion lies of willingly protracting
his cau&s;e; and therefore, that a pur&s;uer may in|&s;i&s;t
upon any new ground of law that was omit|ted
in a former proce&s;s<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 27th December 1692, Kinloch <HI>con|tra</HI> Oliphant.</NOTE>. This opinion is clear|ly
founded on the doctrine above laid down:
<HI>res judicata</HI> has no authority except with re|&s;pect
to the points determined; for &s;o far only
did the judge interpo&s;e his authority.</P>
<P>If the conclu&s;ion be al&s;o different, there can
be no rea&s;on for &s;u&s;taining the <HI>exceptio rei judi|catae.</HI>
&startq;Si quis interdicto egerit de po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ione,

<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed a new proce&s;s having the
&s;ame conclu&s;ion, but upon a different medium,
and al&s;o a new proce&s;s with a different con|clu&s;ion;
there remains only a third variety;
<PB N="181" REF="194">
which is, that the new proce&s;s is the &s;ame
with the former, except as to the pur&s;uer's title.
Take the following example. Being &s;erved heir
in general to my father and &s;ubjected to all his
debts, I bring a reduction, on the head of fraud
and circumvention, of an heritable bond granted
by him; and an ab&s;olvitor goes again&s;t me for
want of &s;ufficient proof. I afterward complete
my right by infeftment to the land upon which
the heritable bond is &s;ecured: and in order to
di&s;burden my e&s;tate of the bond, I bring a fre&s;h
reduction, upon the &s;ame medium, but without
offering any additional proof, either by writ or
witne&s;&s;es. Will the <HI>exceptio rei judicatae</HI> be
&s;u&s;tained again&s;t me? The pre&s;ent proce&s;s is
founded on my right of property; my former,
upon my right to be relieved from payment of
an unju&s;t debt; and therefore, in &s;trict law, the
exception militates not. But upon the principle
of expediency it ought to be &s;u&s;tained: a regu|lar
&s;entence &s;tands again&s;t me, finding there is no
evidence of the fraud and circumvention. I have
no rea&s;on to expect an alteration; and I ought
not to di&s;tre&s;s my party by a new proce&s;s, when
I have no rational pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>So much where the proce&s;s is between the &s;ame
parties. What remains is the effect of an ab&s;ol|vitor,
where the new proce&s;s is carried on by a
different pur&s;uer, or again&s;t a different defendant.
I con&s;ider not repre&s;entatives to be different per|&s;ons:
<PB N="182" REF="195">
an <HI>exceptio rei judicatae,</HI> if available a|gain&s;t
the pur&s;uer him&s;elf, mu&s;t be equally &s;o a|gain&s;t
his repre&s;entatives. I can think but of
one exception; and that is, where the decree is
founded on a curcum&s;tance per&s;onal to the pur&s;uer
or to the defendant. For example, if the ab&s;ol|vitor
proceed upon a promi&s;e made by the pur|&s;uer,
that he him&s;elf &s;hall not demand payment,
the <HI>exceptio rei judicatae</HI> will not bar his repre|&s;entatives.
And if the ab&s;olvitor proceed on a
promi&s;e made to the defendant, that the &s;um &s;hall
not be demanded while he is alive, the <HI>exceptio
rei judicatae</HI> will not benefit his heirs or caution|ers.</P>
<P>In&s;tances are not rare, of a proce&s;s being re|newed
by others than the pur&s;uer of the fir&s;t pro|ce&s;s,
or his repre&s;entatives. Again&s;t &s;uch the
<HI>exceptio rei judicatae</HI> will not operate; becau&s;e,
as ob&s;erved above, the opinion of a judge makes
law between the litigants only, and their heirs.
Thus, in a &s;uit upon the pa&s;&s;ive titles by a credi|tor
of the predece&s;&s;or again&s;t his repre&s;entatives,
and ab&s;olvitor will not bar another creditor in&s;i&s;t|ing
in a proce&s;s of the &s;ame kind. Nor will an
ab&s;olvitor in a proce&s;s of u&s;ury by a private party,
bar the King's Advocate in&s;i&s;ting <HI>ad vindictam
publicam</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Durie, 8th March 1623, King's Advocate <HI>contra</HI> Mori&s;on.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="196">
Though from the nature of a proce&s;s, the <HI>ex|ceptio
rei judicatae</HI> cannot operate in a pro|ce&s;s
of the &s;ame kind carried on by a differ|ent
pur&s;uer; it de&s;erves con&s;ideration, whether,
in &s;ome ca&s;es, it ought not to operate in equity.
I give, for example, a reduction on the head of
deathbed, in which an ab&s;olvitor goes again&s;t the
heir-apparent, who is the pur&s;uer. After his
death, the &s;ame proce&s;s is competent at the in|&s;tance
of the heir-apparent next in order; and as
he repre&s;ents not the former pur&s;uer, the ab&s;olvi|tor
will not avail again&s;t him. And though the
di&s;ponee prevail al&s;o in this proce&s;s, yet he lies o|pen
to new proce&s;&s;es while any per&s;on ramains
who can claim as heir to the di&s;poner. One thing
is evident, that in this reduction there can lie no
&s;u&s;picion of collu&s;ion to bar an equitable remedy;
for it cannot be the intention of the heir who
brings the reduction, to &s;ecure the di&s;ponee by a
&s;imulate proce&s;s, when he can &s;ecure him openly
by a ratification, without needing to put on a
ma&s;k. Two rea&s;ons concur in equity to &s;upport
the <HI>exceptio rei judicatae</HI> again&s;t every &s;ub&s;e|quent
heir. Fir&s;t, the hazard of bribery and
perjury, where the &s;ame facts are admitted to
probation a &s;econd time; and, next, the in&s;up|portable
hard&s;hip of &s;ubjecting the di&s;ponee to re|ductions
without end.</P>
<P>An ab&s;olvitor in a proce&s;s of irritancy carried
on again&s;t a tenant in tail by the immediate &s;ub|&s;titute,
<PB N="184" REF="197">
will not, after that &s;ub&s;titute's death, bar
a new proce&s;s upon the &s;ame facts carried on by
the &s;ub&s;titute next in order. The new proce&s;s
is not barred at common law, becau&s;e an ab&s;ol|vitor
has no effect but again&s;t the parties engaged
in the proce&s;s; nor is it barred in equity, be|cau&s;e
the former proce&s;s may have been collu&s;ive.
This is one of many hard&s;hips that a tenant in
tail is &s;ubjected to.</P>
<P>The defendant, in a reduction upon either of
the bankrupt &s;tatutes, is in a &s;till wor&s;e condition.
Any one creditor may bring a reduction of an
alienation made by the debtor, on the medium of
his in&s;olvency; and an ab&s;olvitor again&s;t one cre|ditor,
avails not again&s;t any other. Again&s;t this
hard&s;hip, which may be intolerable, law knows
no remedy.</P>
<P>In a former article<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Article 21.</NOTE>, mention is made of ac|tions
founded on per&s;onal privileges, &s;uch as, a
reduction on the head of deathbed, on that of
minority and le&s;ion, on interdiction, &amp;c.; and it
is there ob&s;erved, that if the privileged per&s;on re|fu&s;e
to in&s;i&s;t, a court of equity will authori&s;e his
creditors to in&s;i&s;t in his name. And now, with
re&s;pect to an ab&s;olvitor in &s;uch a proce&s;s, I in|quire
whether an action of that kind ought to be
&s;u&s;tained to every &s;ingle creditor, or whether it
be nece&s;&s;ary that all who are known mu&s;t join in
<PB N="185" REF="198">
the proce&s;s. To &s;u&s;tain action at the in&s;tance of
a &s;ingle creditor, may &s;ubject the defendant to
an action at the in&s;tance of every creditor; which
a court of equity will never countenance. There|fore,
to &s;ecure the defendant as much as po&s;&s;ible,
without forfeiting the creditors, the court may
ju&s;tly refu&s;e to &s;u&s;tain the action, till all the cre|ditors
be adverti&s;ed edictally, to concur. And if
an ab&s;olvitor be obtained, the <HI>exceptio rei judi|catae</HI>
ought to be &s;u&s;tained even again&s;t tho&s;e who
did not concur.</P>
<P>If the next in kin, in&s;tead of confirming, take
out a licence to pur&s;ue, and upon that title in&s;i&s;t
in a proce&s;s again&s;t a party &s;uppo&s;ed to be debtor
to the decea&s;ed; will an ab&s;olvitor in that proce&s;s
&s;ecure the defendant, when the pur&s;uer dies with|out
confirmation? It will not: the debt lies &s;till
open to be confirmed by the &s;ucceeding next in
kin; and again&s;t him the ab&s;olvitor does not o|perate.
The commi&s;&s;aries therefore ought to a|void
giving a licence, if the circum&s;tances be not
highly favourable. It is hard indeed to oblige the
pur&s;uer to confirm a doubtful claim, which, after
an expen&s;ive proce&s;s, may produce nothing: on
the other hand, it is no le&s;s hard to oblige a
man, contrary to common law, to &s;u&s;tain a pro|ce&s;s
where he cannot have the benefit of a <HI>res
judicata.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto the effects of a &s;tanding decree have
been under con&s;ideration. But a decree may
<PB N="186" REF="199">
be rever&s;ed, in a reduction, or upon an appeal,
after having, received execution in whole or in
part; and we now proceed to examine, how far
&s;uch execution ought to be &s;upported again&s;t the
rever&s;al. Some decrees proceeding on errors in
fact or in law, are voided as unju&s;t. Some, in
them&s;elves ju&s;t, are voided by means of facts
afterward di&s;covered. I need &s;carce add decrees
that are voided as <HI>ultra vires:</HI> when a judge
tran&s;gre&s;&s;es his powers, he is no better than a pri|vate
per&s;on.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to a decree erroneous in law, a
judge has legal authority to determine controver|&s;ies
regularly brought before him. But his o|pinion
is not, like that of an arbiter, the determi|ning
rule: he is tied down to make law his rule.
And therefore, if the decree he pronounces be
not founded on law, it is void, as de&s;titute of le|gal
authority. Every decree, it is true, is pre|&s;umed
to be according to law; but the pre&s;ump|tion
flies off, if the decree be rever&s;ed in a &s;u|perior
court. I put the ca&s;e, that a certain &s;ub|ject,
the property of which is controverted, is
decreed to belong to the pur&s;uer, who, accor|dingly,
is put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by execution on the
decree. The decree is rever&s;ed in a &s;uperior
court, as erroneous in law: is the property tran&s;|ferred,
yea, or no? The an&s;wer is, that a judge
cannot transfer property without a ju&s;t cau&s;e.
The &s;uperior court pronounces, that the proper|ty
<PB N="187" REF="200">
belongs not to the pur&s;uer, but to the defend|ant.
And accordingly, we find not in the law of
any civilized country, that an unju&s;t decree is
one of the modes of transferring property.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this doctrine, figure a &s;ettlement
of a land-e&s;tate upon a long &s;eries of heirs, and
a controver&s;y between John and James about the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, after the death of a predece&s;&s;or who
left no i&s;&s;ue. James being preferred by the court
of &s;e&s;&s;ion, is &s;erved and infeft; and aliens the e|&s;tate
for a valuable con&s;ideration. The decree is
rever&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and John is found
to be the righteous heir. According to that
judgement, the &s;ervice and infeftment of James
are void; and the alienation made by him is al&s;o
void, as proceeding <HI>a non habente pote&s;tatem.</HI>
The &s;ubject con&s;equently remains <HI>in hereditate
jacente</HI> of the predece&s;&s;or; and John may take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by making up a title as heir. All
that James gains by the decree of the court of
&s;e&s;&s;ion, is to be a <HI>bona fide po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, qui fruc|tus
perceptos et con&s;umptos facit &s;uos.</HI></P>
<P>Money is &s;ingular: the property of it is tran&s;|ferred
by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, not even excepting robbery.
The per&s;on however who has unju&s;tly acquired
the property of money, is bound to pay the equi|valent;
and a decree erroneous in law, will af|ford
no protection; witne&s;s the ca&s;e of payment
made to a putative creditor, by authority of a de|cree.
The decree will protect the debtor from
<PB N="188" REF="201">
the true creditor; but will it al&s;o protect the pu|tative
creditor who has received the money?
No. The putative creditor holds the &s;um <HI>&s;ine
ju&s;ta cau&s;a;</HI> and he is bound in con&s;cience to
pay it to the true creditor; and that payment &s;ets
all to rights.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing now a decree to be affirmed, in&s;tead
of being rever&s;ed, it is effectual from its date, as
if it never had been challenged. One exception
there is, which merits attention. A pari&s;h-mini|&s;ter
is depo&s;ed by the pre&s;bytery; and the &s;en|tence
is affirmed by the &s;ynod and general a&s;&s;em|bly.
He undoubtedly &s;tands depo&s;ed from the
date of the pre&s;bytery's &s;entence; but mu&s;t he
re&s;tore the &s;tipend be&s;towed by him on his pro|ce&s;s,
and on maintenance of his family? He
cannot urge a <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion after the fir&s;t
&s;entence; and he has no defence at common law.
Upon the&s;e grounds it once was found, that the
&s;entence of the a&s;&s;embly operates <HI>retro</HI> to the date
of the &s;entence affirmed, which bars the mini&s;ter
from the &s;tipend falling due in the interim<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">July 1723, Muir <HI>contra</HI> Hepburn.</NOTE>.
But this judgement &s;eems to re&s;t upon common
law, contrary to equity: while a mini&s;ter expects
to have the &s;entence rever&s;ed, it would be rigo|rous
to deprive him of the only fund he has
for pro&s;ecuting the appeal, not to talk of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence
to him&s;elf and family. Equity therefore
continues him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tipend, till the
&s;entence be affirmed in the la&s;t re&s;ort. And if he
<PB N="189" REF="202">
be litigious, he may be &s;ubjected to the expence
of the proce&s;s. Here then is a ca&s;e, where the
ultimate &s;entence only is effectual, though the
fir&s;t &s;entence be ju&s;t. And this mu&s;t always hap|pen,
where the &s;ubject in controver&s;y is alimenta|ry,
&s;uch as the &s;tipend of a mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>The other branch of unju&s;t decrees is, where
they are founded upon an error in fact. All con|trover&s;ies
that can be brought before a court of
ju&s;tice, ari&s;e from facts; and if judgement be gi|ven
upon en error in fact, it is &s;et a&s;ide as not
being a judgement upon the ca&s;e in controver&s;y.</P>
<P>We proceed now to the other kind of decrees,
which, though not unju&s;t, are rendered ineffec|tual
by facts afterward di&s;covered. The follow|ing
ca&s;e is a proper example. The e&s;tate of Bal|quhain
was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many years under a &s;trict
entail. Upon the death of Erne&s;t Le&s;ly without
i&s;&s;ue, a competition aro&s;e between Sir James Le&s;|ly
and Count Antonius Le&s;ly, a German; each
claiming to be &s;erved as next heir of entail.
Count Antonius was preferred by judgement of
the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, affirmed in the la&s;t re&s;ort,
finding him to be the next heir of entail in terms
of the &s;ettlement. Having completed his title to
the e&s;tate by &s;ervice and infeftment, he conti|nued
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;everal years, as undoubted
proprietor. At la&s;t Peter Le&s;ly-Grant entered
the li&s;ts as next &s;ub&s;titute to Count Antonius,
in&s;i&s;ting in a reduction of the Count's right, as
<PB N="190" REF="203">
being an alien, and therefore incapable to inhe|rit
land in Britain. The pur&s;uer prevailed in
his reduction before the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion; and
this judgement was affirmed in the Hou&s;e of
Lords.</P>
<P>The judgement preferring Count Antonius
before Sir James, lay not open to any challenge.
But it was rendered ineffectual by the later
judgement finding Count Antonius an alien.
Nor are the two judgements incon&s;i&s;tent with
each other; their import in conjunction being,
that Count Antonius was next heir of entail,
but that he was per&s;onally di&s;qualified. Thus
&s;tanding the ca&s;e, the que&s;tion is, Whether the
e&s;tate of Balquhain was transferred to Count An|tonius
by his infeftment proceeding on the fir&s;t
judgement? or, Whether the judgement was
null and void, with all its con&s;equences, being
in favour of an alien? Suppo&s;ing the former,
all acts done by him preceding Le&s;ly-Grant's
challenge, mu&s;t be effectual: &s;uppo&s;ing the latter,
the&s;e acts are void, as flowing <HI>a non habente po|te&s;tatem.</HI>
In order to re&s;olve this intricate que|&s;tion,
we a&s;&s;ume a propo&s;ition that will not be
controverted; which is, That a judgement cannot
operate beyond the intention of the judge, more
than a convenant beyond the intention of the con|tractors.
Now, no more was decreed, nor in|tended
to be decreed, but that Count Antonius
was called to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion before Sir James Le&s;|ly;
<PB N="191" REF="204">
and the objection of alienage remained entire.
Hence it is evident, that Count Antonius was on|ly
a putative proprietor, never really ve&s;ted in
the e&s;tate. Suppo&s;e the Count, without oppo&s;i|tion,
to have been infeft as heir of entail, this
infeftment could not transfer the property to him,
an alien; and the oppo&s;ition he met with, could
not &s;upply the defect of his right.</P>
<P>To conclude, when a ju&s;t decree is rendered
ineffectual by facts afterward di&s;covered, every
con&s;equent act mu&s;t be equally ineffectual. Thus,
in the in&s;tance given, the judgement finding
Count Antonius next heir of entail being render|ed
ineffectual by his alienage, the con&s;equent &s;er|vice
and infeftment were equally &s;o. A &s;ervice in
&s;uch a ca&s;e confers no right; and it is an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
maxim, That a title without right is of no
&s;ignificancy.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mutual relief among co-obligants.</HEAD>
<P>DEbtors bound together, whether as co-prin|cipals
or as co-cautioners, are held by law
to be, as in a &s;ociety, bound to act for the com|mon
behoof; and con&s;equently that every right
relative to the common bond, mu&s;t accrue to the
whole, though purcha&s;ed by one of them in his
own name.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that a cautioner paying the debt,
and taking a&s;&s;ignment to him&s;elf, is not at liberty
to lay a&s;ide his character of cautioner, in order
to put him&s;elf in the creditor's place. The a&s;|&s;ignment
accre&s;ces to the whole cautioners, and
cannot be extended farther than the claim of re|lief
would go without it.</P>
<P>Hence, al&s;o, a cautioner demanding relief mu&s;t
communicate ea&s;es: which is &s;aying only, that
he can claim no more from his co-cautioners but
what he has paid ultimately above his proportion
of the debt.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e &s;ix <HI>correi debendi,</HI> or co-obligants.
If one pay the debt, and take an a&s;&s;ignment, what
method is he to follow for operating his relief?
Can he, in virtue of his a&s;&s;ignment, claim the
whole from any one of his co-obligants, &s;ubtract|ing
<PB N="193" REF="206">
only his own &s;hare? Or mu&s;t he be content|ed
with a &s;ixth part from each co-obligant; re|&s;erving
action for a further demand, in ca&s;e any
of them prove in&s;olvent? The fir&s;t is, in effect,
giving to the a&s;&s;ignee the benefit of the a&s;&s;ignment,
to draw more than he would be intitled to by an
action of relief; which is contrary to the equality
that ought to be pre&s;erved among co-obligants.
The other is not le&s;s unequal on the other &s;ide;
for the obligant who has been compelled to pay
the whole debt, is in a wor&s;e condition than the
other co-obligants, each of whom advances the
&s;ixth part only.</P>
<P>The rule therefore ought to be, That every
&s;ingle obligant mu&s;t bear an equal proportion with
the a&s;&s;ignee. For example, Six cautioners are
bound in a bond for L. 600; A, paying the debt,
ought to be relieved of the one half by B; and
each of them is intitled to draw L. 100 from C;
which puts the three upon an equal footing; and
&s;o on, till each of the &s;ix be brought in for his
&s;hare. Now, as this produces a perfect equality
among the co-cautioners, it avoids, at the &s;ame
time, an after reckoning, in ca&s;e of in&s;olvency.</P>
<P>But what if the cautioner who takes an a&s;&s;ign|ment
upon paying the debt, be laid under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of adjudging the e&s;tates of &s;uch of his co|cautioners
as happen to be in&s;olvent. I &s;ee not
that this varies the ca&s;e. He may attack any of
his co-cautioners, and draw out of his effects the
<PB N="194" REF="207">
one half of the &s;um contained in the adjudication.
And having recovered that &s;um, he mu&s;t com|municate
his adjudication to the competing credi|tors;
&s;o as that he and they may recover from
the other co-cautioners what remains of the debt.
I think indeed, that the cautioner-a&s;&s;ignee may ad|judge
for the whole debt, without &s;ubtracting e|ven
his own &s;hare; becau&s;e it is a benefit to the
&s;olvent creditors to have the adjudication as exten|&s;ive
as po&s;&s;ible, in order to draw the greater &s;um
in competition with the other creditors of &s;uch of
the cautioners as happen to be in&s;olvent.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Heir entering cum beneficio inventarii.</HEAD>
<P>FEW branches of our law have made a &s;low|er
progre&s;s toward perfection, than that
concerning heirs entering by an inventory; and
yet no branch de&s;erves more the attention of the
court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, con&s;idering what influence it has
on payment of debts, and circulation of money,
matters of great importance in a commercial coun|try.</P>
<P>In order to improve our law in this particular,
it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate the articles that require rec|tification.
I begin with the hard&s;hip that the cre|ditors
lie under. The creditors, it is true, can
bring the e&s;tate to a &s;ale, a &s;alutary regulation
authori&s;ed in the later practice of the court of
&s;e&s;&s;ion. But then, it is in the power of every
heir who takes the benefit of an inventory, to de|prive
the creditors of that privilege. If before a
proce&s;s of &s;ale be rai&s;ed, the heir enter into pay|ment
of his predece&s;&s;or's debts, the other credi|tors
are barred from a proce&s;s of &s;ale; for after
paying the value, or any part of the value, the e|&s;tate
cannot be wre&s;ted from the heir.</P>
<P>2<HI>do,</HI> As it is admitted, that the heir may le|gally
pay <HI>primo venienti,</HI> favourite creditors will
<PB N="196" REF="209">
be preferred, or &s;uch as give the large&s;t compo&s;i|tion.
A power &s;o arbitrary, which opens a wide
door to inju&s;tice, and even to fraud, is a re|proach
to the law of a civilized country. And
yet the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, far from repre&s;&s;ing the
evil, have countenanced it; finding, that an heir
<HI>cum inventario,</HI> may not only pay <HI>primo venien|ti,</HI>
but may al&s;o prefer what creditors he plea&s;es,
by granting heritable bonds of corroboration.
Nay, farther, if the creditors allow a year to e|lap&s;e,
there is nothing to bar the heir from a|li$ning
the whole e&s;tate, which effectually prevents
a &s;ale at their in&s;tance.</P>
<P>3<HI>tio,</HI> It may readily happen, that a per&s;onal
action for payment is carried on again&s;t the
heir by one creditor, and a &s;ale of the land by
another. What &s;hall be done in that ca&s;e?
Both actions cannot proceed; and yet no rule
appears for giving a preference to either. A fa|vourite
creditor will never be wanting to car|ry
on the per&s;onal action, with a view to &s;erve
the heir, in contradiction to all the other credi|tors.</P>
<P>As our law &s;tands at pre&s;ent, the heir is al&s;o
&s;ubjected to many hard&s;hips. If, apprehending
the debts to exceed or equal the value of the e|&s;tate,
he make no oppo&s;ition to a &s;ale at their in|&s;tance,
the whole may &s;oon be brought to a fair
conclu&s;ion. The price is divided among the cre|ditors;
and the &s;urpi$s, if any, goes to the heir.
<PB N="197" REF="210">
But if all the debts that he can di&s;cover do not
exceed the value of the e&s;tate, his affection for
his paternal inheritance makes him pay the whole,
fearing no further di&s;turbance. I &s;ee not however,
that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate is &s;ecured to him.
A new creditor &s;tarting up any time within forty
years, can relevantly alledge, that the debts paid
amount not to the value of the e&s;tate. This
brings on an intricate, tedious, and expen&s;ive
law-&s;uit; and the decree, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be in
favour of the heir, protects him not again&s;t the
&s;ame di&s;tre&s;&s;ing cour&s;e with other creditors who
afterward appear; for they are not bound by a
judgement to which they were not parties. And
&s;o the heir lies open to perpetual hara&s;&s;ment,
without pro&s;pect of an end.</P>
<P>In the&s;e unhappy circum&s;tances, the heir's
hands are effectually tied up from making any
improvements. For it is a rule e&s;tabli&s;hed by
the court, That the heir mu&s;t account to credi|tors
according to the pre&s;ent value of the inven|tory.</P>
<P>Luckily, a remedy to the&s;e evils falls under the
<HI>nobile officium</HI> of the court; and our judges
cannot be more u&s;efully employed than in e&s;ta|bli&s;hing
a proper remedy. In that view, the fol|lowing
hints are &s;ugge&s;ted to be corrected or im|proved.</P>
<P>1. That within a month after the inventory
is recorded in the books of &s;e&s;&s;ion, adverti&s;ements
<PB N="198" REF="211">
mu&s;t be put in the news-papers, calling the cre|ditors
to produce their grounds of debt with|in
&s;ix months, in the hands of the keeper of the
&s;aid record; of which a li&s;t &s;hall be made, &s;ub|&s;cribed
by the keeper and witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>2. That the heir &s;hall have forty days for exa|mining
the li&s;ts and vouchers, in order finally to
re&s;olve, either to abandon the e&s;tate to the cre|ditors,
or to hold the e&s;tate and &s;ubject him&s;elf
to the claims contained in the li&s;t. And till that
term be elap&s;ed, the creditors &s;hall be barred from
doing any diligence.</P>
<P>3. If the heir &s;uffer the forty days to elap&s;e,
without delaring his re&s;olution as afore&s;aid, the
creditors are impowered forthwith to bring the
e&s;tate to a &s;ale, as a bankrupt-e&s;tate; the price
to be divided among the creditors, the &s;urplus
to the heir, if there be any &s;urplus.</P>
<P>4. If the heir come to a re&s;olution to hold the
e&s;tate, he mu&s;t, before commencement of a pro|ce&s;s
of &s;ale, deliver to the keeper a formal deed,
binding him&s;elf to pay all the claims contained in
the li&s;t; re&s;erving to him, as to any other heir,
objections and defences that may be competent a|gain&s;t
particular claims.</P>
<P>5. In that ca&s;e, he &s;hall be intitled to apply to
the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, praying, that the ju&s;t value
of the lands and other &s;ubjects contained in
the inventory, be a&s;certained by a proof. And
the value thus a&s;certained by the court &s;hall be
<PB N="199" REF="212">
held the ju&s;t value, to bind the heir, and all the
creditors who may afterward appear.</P>
<P>6. After the value is thus a&s;certained, and
the objections and defences again&s;t particular
claims are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; the court, upon a &s;econd
application by the heir, &s;hall take in&s;pection of
the claims &s;u&s;tained. If the&s;e be found to equal
the a&s;certained value of the inventory, the heir
&s;hall be declared free from being further liable
to any debts or deeds of his predece&s;&s;ors. If
they fall &s;hort of the a&s;certained value, the ba|lance,
with its intere&s;t, &s;hall be declared a &s;um
in the hands of the heir, ready for creditors who
may afterward appear.</P>
<P>7. If the heir neglect to apply to the court
for a&s;certaining the value as afore&s;aid, he &s;hall be
bound to account to the creditors who afterward
appear, for the &s;ubjects inventoried according to
the value at the time of the demand. When
this value is a&s;certained by a proof, and from it
is &s;ubtracted the &s;ums paid to the creditors who
appeared in due time, the remainder &s;hall be a
fund in the hands of the heir, for &s;atisfying the
pre&s;ent creditors; and if there be a &s;urplus, it
&s;hall remain for other creditors who may after|ward
appear, or who have appeared after the &s;ix
months allowed to creditors to produce their
grounds of debt in the keeper's hands.</P>
<P>8. If the heir, without &s;ignifying his re&s;olution
of keeping or abandoning the e&s;tate, &s;hall di&s;po&s;e
<PB N="200" REF="213">
of it, or of any part, he &s;hall be &s;ubjected univer|&s;ally,

<P>EArly in life &s;ome of my lei&s;ure-hours were
employed to frame e&s;&s;ays on particular heads
of Scotch law; and the&s;e e&s;&s;ays, intended for
private u&s;e merely, found however their way into
the public. Again&s;t frequent &s;olicitations, I re|&s;olved,
that that juvenile performance &s;hould never

not be indulged in later editions, when the ex|cu&s;e

better, to incorporate in my later works the &s;ub|&s;tance

intere&s;t is &s;ufficient to intitle one to &s;ue or to

<P>In a competition among rights burdening land,
priority of time determines the preference. A
land-proprietor who burdens his land with an he|ricable
bond completed by infeftment, yields pre|ference
to the creditor in a competition about
the rents. And as he him&s;elf is po&s;tponed to the
creditor, every &s;ub&s;equent right he grants mu&s;t
equally be po&s;tponed. For the &s;ame rea&s;on,
where the e&s;tate is &s;old, the infeftment of annual-rent
is preferable on the price, as formerly on
the land. Hence in a competition among real
rights, the rule is, <HI>Prior tempore, potior jure.</HI></P>
<P>Certain objections, or grounds of reduction,
di&s;turb the operation of this rule, by &s;etting a|&s;ide
a prior creditor in competition with one po|&s;terior;
an inhibition, for example, a con&s;ent
by one creditor to the preference of another, and
many others that occur in rankings.</P>
<P>No rule is more ea&s;y in its application, than
that of ranking real debts according to their dates.
But it is not always ea&s;y to determine the effect
of objections, or grounds of reduction. The
way is, to begin with computing what each &s;hould
draw by the general rule, <HI>Prior tempore, potior
jure;</HI> and this will be the ultimate draught of
the creditors who are not &s;ubjected to any ob|jection
or ground of reduction. Proceed next
<PB N="203" REF="216">
to con&s;ider what a po&s;terior creditor is intitled to
draw from a prior, again&s;t who&s;e right he has
an objection of ground of reduction. As every
relevant ground of reduction is, in a competition,
con&s;idered as equivalent to a decree of reduc|tion;
the prior creditor may be laid a&s;ide, as &s;up|po&s;ed
to be cut down by a decree of reduction;
and whatever &s;um the po&s;terior creditor would
draw out of the common fund upon that &s;uppo|&s;ition,
he is intitled to demand from the prior
creditor: there is no rea&s;on for confining him to
a le&s;s &s;um; and he can have no pretext for de|manding
more. This operation requires to be
explained; and the be&s;t explanation will be ex|amples.
Let three real creditors be &s;uppo&s;ed in
the order of time, John, James, and William.
William lent his money upon a con&s;ent from
John to his preference. The fund is 6, each
of the debts 4. Ranking the three creditors ac|cording
to the order of time, which is the fir&s;t
&s;tep, John draws 4, James the remaining 2, and
nothing is left to William. We then proceed to
con&s;ider the effect of John's con&s;ent to William's
preference; which imports no more but that
John &s;hall make no oppo&s;ition to William, lea|ving
him to draw as if he John were not in the
field. To give the con&s;ent any further effect,
would make it the &s;ame with a conveyance of
John's claim to William; which is not the in|tendment
of a naked con&s;ent to a preference.
<PB N="204" REF="217">
Laying then John a&s;ide, William can draw but
2; becau&s;e James, as prior in time, excludes him
from the other 4; and this &s;um of 2, William is
intitled to draw from John. The re&s;ult of the whole
is, that John draws 2, James 2, and William 2.
I &s;tate another ca&s;e. Suppo&s;e the fund to be 8,
and each of the debts 6. By the rule of time,
John draws 6, and James the remaining 2, lea|ving
nothing to William. Taking next the con|&s;ent
under con&s;ideration, William can draw but
2, becau&s;e James covers from him the other 6
by the rule of time; and that &s;um he draws from
John. The re&s;ult is, that John draws 4, James
2, and William 2. Ca&s;es may be figured where
con&s;ent has the &s;ame effect with a conveyance.
The fund is 12: each of the debts 6. By the
rule of time, William draws nothing; but by
laying John a&s;ide, he will draw 6; and that &s;um
he takes from John. In this ca&s;e, William draws
from John all that John is intitled to by the rule
of time. But this proceeds from the proportion
of figures, not from the nature of con&s;ent. On
the other hand, ca&s;es may be figured, where the
con&s;ent has no effect; as where James covers the
whole fund from William. In that ca&s;e, Wil|liam
has nothing to draw from John; becau&s;e he
would draw nothing, &s;uppo&s;ing John to be out of
the field.</P>
<P>The double ranking may be avoided, by laying
John, the con&s;enter, a&s;ide, in computing what

William, the per&s;on con&s;ented to, is intitled to
draw; and his draught will always be what is
left of the fund by the preferable creditors. Thus,
in the fir&s;t example, James being preferable to Wil|liam
for his whole debt, the remainder, which
is only 2, falls to William's &s;hare. The follow|ing
illu&s;tration will make this method clear. Wil|liam,
propo&s;ing to lend his money on heritable
&s;ecurity, finds the &s;ubject preoccupied by two
real creditors, John and James. The former, in
order to accommodate the proprietor, his rela|tion,
is willing to give preference to William;
who, upon that condition, lends his money, and
obtains an infeftment of annualrent. According
to this tran&s;action, what remains of the fund un|occupied
by James, is all that William has to de|pend
on for his payment; and the price of that
remainder he is intitled to draw as far as his debt
extends.</P>
<P>The &s;ame method holds, where, in&s;tead of a
con&s;ent, William has an inhibition that &s;trikes
out John's debt. The inhibition, like con&s;ent,
has only the effect of giving a preference; and
puts not the inhibiter in place of the per&s;on in|hibited,
which would require an a&s;&s;ignment.
James, in all events, is preferable to William,
becau&s;e William's inhibition &s;trikes not again&s;t
him: William can draw nothing but what re|mains
unoccupied by James; and that remainder
he draws from John; or, by the more &s;imple
<PB N="206" REF="219">
method, he draws it directly out of the price of
the land.</P>
<P>The &s;ame method is equally applicable to every
ground of reduction, that affords a preference
only, and is not equivalent to an a&s;&s;ignment. I
give an example from the Roman law. By that
law, a conventional hypothec recorded, is prefer|red
before one not recorded; but a legal hypo|thec
requires not to be recorded. One borrows
a &s;um upon a hypothec, which the creditor ne|glects
to put on record. The debtor afterward
is made a tutor; and by the Roman law, all his
effects are hypothecated to the pupil. La&s;t of
all, he borrows another &s;um upon a hypothec,
which is put on record. According to the rule
of time, the claims mu&s;t be ranked in the order
here mentioned. But what di&s;turbs this order,
is the law preferring a conventional hypothec re|corded
before one not recorded; which intitles
the former to draw as if the latter were not in the
field. And this ca&s;e accordingly is &s;imilar to tho&s;e
above mentioned, where a po&s;terior real creditor
is preferred before a prior, by con&s;ent or by in|hibition.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tands the law where the ground of re|duction
operates a total preference. Next in or|der
are ca&s;es where it operates only a partial pre|&s;erence,
as in adjudications within year and day.
John, for example, is an adjudger infeft; James
has an heritable bond and infeftment of a lat$$
<PB N="207" REF="220">
date; after whom comes William, a &s;econd ad|judger
within year and day of the fir&s;t. All
that William has to depend on, is what remains
of the fund after James obtains payment. As
to that remainder, he is ranked <HI>pari pa&s;&s;$</HI>
with John; which comes to the &s;ame with pre|ferring
him before John as to the half of the re|mainder.
John, the fir&s;t adjudger, is preferred
before James, the annualrenter; and James be|fore
William, the &s;econd adjudger; both by pri|ority
of time. William, by act 1661, is prefer|red
before John for half of the remainder; and
that half he draws, as if John were not in the
field. Suppo&s;e the fund to be 6, and each of
the debts 4. John draws 4, in competition with
James, leaving the remaining 2 to James, which
he retains ultimately. William can never draw
more than 2, the re&s;t of the fund being preoc|cupied
by James; for the half of which William
is preferred before John. Upon the whole,
John draws 3, James 2, and William 1. Here
it is taken for granted, that the act 1661 does
not intitle the &s;econd adjudger to draw as much
as the fir&s;t; but only that it bars the preference
given by common law to the fir&s;t adjudger. See
another example of the &s;ame kind at the clo&s;e of
the 36th article.</P>
<P>Having laid down the method of determining
what a po&s;terior creditor ought to draw from a
prior, by virtue of a ground of reduction, par|tial
<PB N="208" REF="221">
or total; my next care &s;hall be, to render the
&s;ubject familiar, by adding other examples. John
is an annualrenter, fir&s;t in time; after him come
James and William, adjudgers <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u.</HI> Wil|liam
lent his money, tru&s;ting to a con&s;ent obtain|ed
from John; but after an inhibition by James.
The fund is 6: each of the debts 4. By the
general rule, <HI>Prior tempore,</HI> John draws 4;
James and William each of them 1. Con&s;ider|ing
next the grounds of reduction, James, by his
inhibition, &s;trikes William out of the field; and
draws all that is left by John, which is 2; and
that &s;um he retains ultimately. William, by
John's con&s;ent, &s;trikes him out of the field: all
however that he can draw after yielding prefer|ence
to James the inhibiter, is 2. Upon the ul|timate
divi&s;ion, each of the competitors draws 2.
Suppo&s;ing the fund to be 6, as before, and each
of the debts to be 5; John draws 4, James 1,
and William 1. Suppo&s;ing the fund to continue
6, and each of the debts to be 6; John draws the
whole. I intreat the reader's peculiar attention
to the following example. Fir&s;t, an a&s;&s;ignment
duly intimated; &s;econd, an arre&s;tment interve|ning
between the a&s;&s;ignment and intimation;
third, and adjudication proceeding upon a citation,
po&s;terior in date to the a&s;&s;ignment, but prior to
the arre&s;tment. The &s;ubject is land-rent; and
the parties are all convened in a multiple-poind|ing.
The arre&s;tment is preferable to the a&s;&s;ign|ment
<PB N="209" REF="222">

the ground of preference in all: which is a con|tradiction;
for if A be preferred before B upon
any ground, B cannot be preferred before A up|pon
the &s;ame ground. The circles that have hi|therto
occurred, proceed upon different grounds
of preference; and there is nothing more &s;imple,
than that A &s;hould be preferred before B upon
one ground, and B before A on another. But
in the ca&s;e given, there mu&s;t lurk &s;omewhere a
fundamental error; for to prefer a number of
per&s;ons in a circle upon the &s;ame ground, is a
&s;lat contradiction. Nor is it difficult to di&s;cover
the error: in preferring the arre&s;tment before the
a&s;&s;ignment, the arre&s;tment is &s;uppo&s;ed to make a
<HI>nexus realis</HI> on the &s;ubject; which an a&s;&s;ignment,
without intimation, certainly does not: in prefer|ring
the adjudication before the arre&s;tment, an
arre&s;tment is held to be &s;imply a per&s;onal prohi|bition;
for if it made a <HI>nexus realis,</HI> it ought to
be preferred before the adjudication. If either
&s;uppo&s;ition be adopted, the ranking will be ea&s;ily
adju&s;ted. If an arre&s;tment make a <HI>nexus $ealis,</HI>
it is preferable before both the a&s;&s;ignment and de|creet
<PB N="210" REF="223">
of adjudication: if it be a per&s;onal prohibi|tion
only, both are preferred before it. And
that the purpo&s;e of an arre&s;tment is only to
prohibit the arre&s;tee from making payment to
the common debtor, will be evident, fir&s;t, from
the tenor of the writ; next, from its giving way
to a poinding of the goods arre&s;ted; and, la&s;t,
from its giving way to a po&s;terior adjudication.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the ranking of creditors, we
proceed to that of different di&s;ponees, each claim|ing
the property. Among di&s;ponees, as among
creditors, the general rule of ranking from prio|rity
of time takes place; and there may be
grounds of reduction, by which a po&s;terior di&s;|ponee
prevails over one that is prior. There is
no difference, but that a di&s;ponee claims the &s;ub|ject
it&s;elf, upon which a creditor has only a &s;ecu|rity.
And when the claim of creditor is &s;o
great as to cover the whole &s;ubject, even that
di&s;tinction vani&s;hes. The foregoing method
therefore of determining the effect of grounds
of reduction between creditors, is equally appli|cable
to di&s;ponees. Take the following exam|ples;
in which the competing rights &s;hall be &s;ta|ted
in the order of time, to &s;ave the embarra&s;&s;|ment
of many words.</P>
<P>Example 1. A deathbed-deed completed,
but reducible by the heir. A &s;econd deathbed-deed
of the &s;ame &s;ubject, con&s;ented to by the
heir. The fir&s;t deed excludes the &s;econd: the
<PB N="211" REF="224">
&s;econd excludes the heir: and the heir excludes
the fir&s;t. In determining this competition, I
take it for granted, that the heir's con&s;ent to the
&s;econd deed, operates not a conveyance of his
privilege, but barely a <HI>non repugnantia.</HI> Upon
that &s;uppo&s;ition, the fir&s;t di&s;ponee prevails. The
heir may be laid a&s;ide as having no intere&s;t in
the que&s;tion; for in no event can he draw a
&s;hilling by his reduction. This ca&s;e is &s;ingular,
a con&s;ent intended to benefit one, benefiting an
antagoni&s;t without intention. But though &s;ingu|lar,
it is not &s;ole: the following is of the &s;ame
kind. A ba&s;e infeftment of ward-lands. A &s;e|cond
infeftment of the &s;ame made public by the
&s;uperior's confirmation. The fir&s;t infeftment
will prevail by means of the &s;uperior's con&s;ent,
though intended to benefit the other infeftment;
becau&s;e the &s;uperior, by that con&s;ent, has now no
intere&s;t to in&s;i&s;t in a declarator of recognition a|gain&s;t
the fir&s;t infeftment.</P>
<P>Example 2. An adjudication with a charge a|gain&s;t
the &s;uperior. A di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ame
land with infeftment. A &s;econd adjudication with|in
year and day of the fir&s;t. The fir&s;t adjudica|tion
excludes the voluntary right: the voluntary
right excludes the &s;econd adjudication: and that
adjudication is ranked <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with the fir&s;t.
By the general rule of time, the fir&s;t adjudger
draws his whole &s;um; leaving the remainder of
the fund of the voluntary right. This concludes
<PB N="212" REF="225">
the ranking; for the &s;econd adjudger, being to|tally
excluded by the voluntary right, has no
claim again&s;t the fir&s;t adjudger.</P>
<P>Example 3. A di&s;po&s;ition of land. An adju|dication
with a charge again&s;t the &s;uperior. An
adjudication without year and day, clothed with
infeftment. And, after all, infeftment on the
di&s;po&s;ition. The adjudger infeft draws his whole
&s;um, leaving what remains to the di&s;ponee.</P>
<P>I conclude with the following ob&s;ervation. There
is not much intricacy in computing what creditors
ought to draw, where competitions are reduced to
the &s;imple ca&s;es above figured. But it requires a
con&s;iderable degree of &s;agacity, to reduce to &s;uch
&s;implicity the endle&s;s varieties that occur in rank|ings.
The operation requires the &s;ame &s;ort of &s;a|gacity
that is requi&s;ite for reducing algebraic e|quations
to their &s;imple&s;t terms. I know no rule
for either. Practice is the only means for acqui|ring
a facility in &s;uch matters.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">What intere&s;t is &s;ufficient to entitle one to
&s;ue or to defend.</HEAD>
<P>NO rational man ever acts unle&s;s with an
intention to produce &s;ome effect. There|fore,
in a court of ju&s;tice, however well found|ed
an action or a defence may be in it&s;elf, it will
be rejected as idle and fooli&s;h, if the per&s;on who
acts can draw no benefit from it, or have no <HI>in|tere&s;t</HI>
in it, as expre&s;&s;ed in law-terms. Hence a
rule, That <HI>right</HI> without <HI>intere&s;t</HI> will not be &s;u&s;|tained
in a proce&s;s, either by way of action or
objection: and as little will <HI>intere&s;t</HI> without <HI>right.</HI></P>
<P>But mark, that in a proce&s;s no per&s;on's in|tere&s;t
will be regarded, but that of the per&s;on
who acts. The &s;ocial nature of man moves him
to exert many actions for the good of others;
but there is a &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;on that con&s;ines a
judge to the intere&s;t of the litigants, without re|garding
the intere&s;t of others; which is, that a
decree is effectual between the litigants only;
and a court will give no countenance to an action
or to a defence that cannot be effectual. If a de|cree
could have any effect again&s;t a third party,
it would be ea&s;y, by artful management, to pro|cure
a judgement again&s;t per&s;ons who all the
<PB N="214" REF="227">

them<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Principles of Equity, edit. 2. p. 60.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, where a man goes out of his road to
urge a point he has no intere&s;t in, the plead|ing

who pleads what is not his own intere&s;t, is term|ed
<HI>jus tertii;</HI> and that term is carele&s;sly applied
to every ca&s;e where the per&s;on pleading has no
intere&s;t, whether it regard the intere&s;t of any third
per&s;on, or not.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;ubject of this article, there
is one general rule, That no intere&s;t is regarded
in a proce&s;s but what is pecuniary: a court of
law concerns it&s;elf with nothing but what tends to
augment or le&s;&s;en a man's e&s;tate. The intere&s;t
of ambition, of revenge, or of any other pa&s;&s;ion
that is not lucrative, is totally di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>When we de&s;cend to particulars, I can di&s;cover
no rules for determining, in every ca&s;e, what in|tere&s;t
is &s;ufficient to carry on a proce&s;s, or to de|fend
again&s;t it. The only way I have to give in|&s;truction,
is to quote examples; which &s;hall be
cla&s;&s;ed in the be&s;t order that occurs.</P>
<P>I begin with examining what intere&s;t is &s;uffi|cient
to enable a pur&s;uer to carry on his proce&s;s.

them &s;hould alien under pain of forfeiting his

right, being tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed by one of them, the o|ther
brought a proce&s;s of forfeiture. The court
refu&s;ed to &s;u&s;tain action; becau&s;e the pur&s;uer had
no pecuniary intere&s;t to bar the defendant from
aliening<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Durie, 11th February 1630, Ker <HI>contra</HI> Lempitlaw.</NOTE>. Sir Robert Hepburn &s;ettled his e|&s;tate

younger brother. After Sir Robert's death, the
young lady rai&s;ed a proce&s;s again&s;t Congalton,
concluding, that he had lo&s;t the e&s;tate by refu|&s;ing
to marry her. Objected, That the pur&s;uer
had no intere&s;t to in&s;i&s;t in a proce&s;s that did not
benefit her, but the defendant's brother. The

judgement. The pur&s;uer had no intere&s;t but
that of revenge, to which law gives no counte|nance.
There is be&s;ide an invincible objection to
the judgement, which appears to have been to|tally
overlooked, which is, that the pur&s;uer had no
right to carry on the proce&s;s: &s;he was <HI>po&s;ita in
conditione</HI> only, and no right was given her by
the &s;ettlement, to found an action upon. A &s;u|perior

&startq;That the pur&s;uer could not object the

ill founded in point of right, it was ju&s;tly di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed,
as intere&s;t without right avails nothing.</P>
<P>The defendant comes next in order. And as
every defendant finds his account in an ab&s;olvitor,
it is obviou&s;ly his intere&s;t to de&s;end him&s;elf a|gain&s;t
a claim that is not founded on law. A &s;he|riff
having di&s;obeyed a charge to take a debtor
who was denounced rebel upon a horning, was
&s;ued by the creditor for payment of the debt.
Objected, That the denunciation was informal;
that the debtor could not regularly be impri&s;on|ed

<P>Next of objections again&s;t the pur&s;uer's title,
&s;uppo&s;ing the claim to be well founded in law.
Such objections are either what appear from the
production, or what require to be verified by e|vidence.
With re&s;pect to the former, the de|fendant
can never be barred by a <HI>jus tertii</HI> from
<PB N="218" REF="231">
&s;tating them. For it is the duty of the judge
him&s;elf, to take notice of &s;uch objections; and if
he overlook them, they may be &s;ugge&s;ted by the
defendant, or by any one as <HI>amicus curiae.</HI> Take
the following examples. In a &s;uit for teind be|longing
to the lord&s;hip of Dunfermline, founded
on a lea&s;e granted by King William, the pur|&s;uer's
title was objected to, as flowing <HI>a non ha|bente
pote&s;tatem;</HI> becau&s;e the lord&s;hip of Dun|fermline
did not belong to King William, but to
James VII. heir to Queen Anne of Denmark.
An&s;wered, It is <HI>jus tertii</HI> for the defendant to
plead on Queen Anne's right, &s;eeing he derived
no right from her. The objection was repelled,
becau&s;e the defendant derived no right from
Queen Anne of Denmark<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 26th January 1699, Marquis of Tweed|dale <HI>contra</HI> Sir David Thoirs.</NOTE>. The objection
here to the pur&s;uer's title was notorious:
James VII. never was forfeited; and his abdica|ting
the crown deprived him not of his private e|&s;tate.
As this objection was verified by the pro|duction
it&s;elf, it was the duty of the court to di&s;|mi&s;s
the proce&s;s, as the pur&s;uer had no title to
carry it on; and the defendant's right could not
regularly come under con&s;ideration. In a pro|ce&s;s
for arrears of teind founded on a charter of
adjudication of the teind, with infeftment; this
was not &s;u&s;tained as a &s;ufficient title to force pay|ment
from the proprietor of the land, who had
<PB N="219" REF="232">
levied the teind<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Forbes, 29th November 1710, Mitchell <HI>contra</HI> Baillie.</NOTE>. It was thought, that the ad|judication
it&s;elf ought to have been produced,
with the title of the per&s;on again&s;t whom it was
led. The pur&s;uer's production might have been
&s;ufficient in a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ory action; but in a petitory
action, which was the ca&s;e in que&s;tion, a com|plete
progre&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary for teind, as well as for
land. As the defect of the pur&s;uer's title was
obvious from his production, the court ju&s;tly de|nied
action. And even &s;uppo&s;ing the title to
have been good <HI>ex facie,</HI> to make it nece&s;&s;ary for
the defendant to verify &s;ome legal objection a|gain&s;t
it; &s;uch an objection, moved by the pro|prietor
of the land, ought to have been admitted
to proof; for he obviou&s;ly had an intere&s;t to de|mand
the teind from the patron at &s;ix years pur|cha&s;e,
rather than from the titular at nine years
purcha&s;e. Yet in a declarator of the property of
teind, an adjudication both of land and teind,
proceeding on a &s;pecial charge to enter heir, was
&s;u&s;tained as a good title, without obliging the

<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 7th November 1704, Nicol <HI>contra</HI> Park.</NOTE>. Taking this judgement literally, it
is ill founded; for a wad&s;etter, in a proce&s;s of
redemption again&s;t him, has an evident intere&s;t
to object to the title of the pur&s;uer, in order to
retain a lucrative po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But though he has
an intere&s;t, yet he has no title to make the ob|jection.
Negative pre&s;cription operates in favour
of the debtor only, and not in favour of any third
party. It was competent to the rever&s;er to ob|ject
the negative pre&s;cription to the appri&s;ing led
again&s;t him, but not to the wad&s;etter again&s;t
whom the appri&s;ing was not led. And probably
this is what was intended by the court. Again&s;t
a declarator of the juri&s;diction of a con&s;tabulary,
the negative pre&s;cription being objected; the ob|jection
was &s;u&s;tained, and found not to be <HI>jus

cau&s;e. Negative pre&s;cription was an objection to
the pur&s;uer's claim that required no proof; and
as it was not controverted on the pur&s;uer's part,
no more was incumbent on the court, but to &s;u&s;|tain
the objection, and to di&s;mi&s;s the proce&s;s.</P>
<P>We proceed to objections again&s;t a title <HI>ex fa|cie</HI>

ca&s;es tend to clear what intere&s;t is &s;uffi|cient.
In a forthcoming on an arre&s;tment, it was
objected by the arre&s;tee, That the debt which
founded the arre&s;tment was paid. The objection
was relevant; but it was found <HI>jus tertii</HI> in the
arre&s;tee to move it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Durie, 21&s;t December 1621, Hamilton <HI>contra</HI> Dur|ham.</NOTE>. The arre&s;tee had no in|tere&s;t
but to pay &s;afely; and as here he had the
authority of the court to make payment to the
pur&s;uer of the forthcoming, payment could not
be demanded from him a &s;econd time, by the
common debtor, or by any other. In a &s;uit for
arrears of teind, by a donatar of &s;ingle e&s;cheat

<PB N="222" REF="235">
the defendant objected, That the horning was
informal, and that e&s;cheat could not fall upon it.
As the title appeared <HI>ex facie</HI> good, the objec|tion
was repelled, becau&s;e the defendant was
liable for the teind; and the obtaining a delay of
payment, was not a &s;ufficient intere&s;t to intitle

his horning informal<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Haddington, 23d June 1612, Earl Mar <HI>contra</HI> Ewing.</NOTE>. A woman having paid

the nullity of a gift of e&s;cheat, as having been

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Commentary on the acts of parliament
concerning negative and po&s;itive pre|&s;criptions

<P>PRoperty is a relation between men and
things, that is not attended with any vi&s;i|ble
mark. I buy a hor&s;e, and pay for him upon
delivery. This fact e&s;tabli&s;hes the relation be|tween
me and the hor&s;e; but as the purcha&s;e
makes no vi&s;ible alteration, either in me or in the
hor&s;e, the relation of property e&s;tabli&s;hed thereby,
is merely a mental conception<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Elements of Critici&s;m, vol. 1. p. 336. edit. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such conceptions are not familiar among &s;ava|ges
or barbarians. Something vi&s;ible is nece&s;&s;a|ry
to give them a notion of property: they con|&s;ider
a man to be proprietor, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es and
u&s;es a &s;ubject at will; and, independent of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
they have no conception of property.
In the laws accordingly of many nations, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
is under&s;tood to be &s;o e&s;&s;ential to property,
that the lo&s;s of the former always infers the lo&s;s
of the latter<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="242">
In the progre&s;s of nations toward maturity of
under&s;tanding, ab&s;tract ideas become familiar:
property is ab&s;tracted from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and in
our conceptions it is now firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, that
the want of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion deprives not a man of his
property. If my hor&s;e be &s;tolen from me, or
be lo&s;t any other way, I am under&s;tood notwith|&s;tanding
to retain the property <HI>animo,</HI> or men|tally.</P>
<P>But how long can the property of a &s;ubject be
retained mentally, when &s;eparated from po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion?
Is the &s;en&s;e of property &s;o vigorous, as to
carry on the relation for ever? This is a knot|ty
que&s;tion, that leads back to the very founda|tion
of property. As man requires food, rai|ment,
habitation, and other nece&s;&s;aries; the ma|terials
from which the&s;e are formed, are placed
within his reach, for his indu&s;try to work upon.
And to favour his indu&s;try, he is endued with a
&s;en&s;e of property, which protects every one's po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions
from the rapacity of others. I lay hold
of a field, never formerly occupied, and culti|vate
it for my own u&s;e: the perception I have of
its being my property, is clear and complete;
and it is equally &s;o, where I purcha&s;e a field from
a per&s;on whom I know to have been the fir&s;t oc|cupant.
This perception continues equally clear
and complete while I retain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sketches of the hi&s;tory of man, book 1. &s;ketch 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="243">
Connected with the perception of property, is
an affection of which property is the object, and
which every man feels with re&s;pect to what he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es as his own. This affection, weak at
fir&s;t, becomes more vigorous by time: the u&s;e
of living in a certain hou&s;e, or cultivating a cer|tain
field, enlivens gradually my affection for the
&s;ubject as my property, even to extreme old age.</P>
<P>Let us examine the operation of the&s;e princi|ples,
where one has lo&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ubject.
It is mentioned above, that a man recently de|prived
of a &s;ubject again&s;t his will, retains the
property <HI>animo;</HI> and it is evident, that his affec|tion
for the &s;ubject continue as vivid as before.
But do matters continue in that &s;tate for ever?
The an&s;wer mu&s;t be in the negative. The man
retains his property <HI>animo,</HI> and his affection for
it, as long as he has any hope of recovery; but
they turn fainter and fainter by length of time.
Hope at la&s;t vani&s;hes; the &s;ubject wears out
of remembrance, and is ab&s;olutely forgotten.
The lo&s;s of a moveable &s;oon wears out of me|mory,
if it be not of great value. Land, which
is a permanent &s;ubject and produces a &s;tronger
affection, continues longer in memory. But
where the &s;ubject has been long lo&s;t and no re|membrance
of it remaining, the relation of pro|perty
is di&s;&s;olved: the &s;en&s;e of property does not
&s;upport the relation in that ca&s;e; but leaves the
<PB N="231" REF="244">
&s;ubject open to a new occupant, preci&s;ely as be|fore
it was fir&s;t appropriated.</P>
<P>But whatever may happen to a moveable, land
&s;eldom remains long unoccupied. It frequently hap|pens,
that while I yet keep my &s;ubject in remem|brance
with &s;ome remaining affection for it, an|other
has purcha&s;ed the &s;ubject <HI>bona fide</HI> from
one who behaved as proprietor. This is the ni|ce&s;t
ca&s;e that can happen with re&s;pect to proper|perty:
let us carefully examine what the moral
&s;en&s;e dictates upon it. If recently after the pur|cha&s;e,
it be di&s;covered, that the per&s;on who &s;old
had no right; the purcha&s;er, upon con&s;ulting his
con&s;cience, will find him&s;elf bound to re&s;tore the
&s;ubject to the true proprietor, provided he &s;till
retain his affection for it, and have kept it all
along in view. But &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>bona fide</HI> pur|cha&s;er
to have been long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to
have acquired a &s;trong affection for the &s;ubject;
the moral &s;en&s;e will determine in his favour, a|gain&s;t
an antagoni&s;t, who&s;e affection for the &s;ub|ject
mu&s;t by this time be weak, and his remem|brance
faint. This antagoni&s;t and his heirs have
had time to dige&s;t their lo&s;s; and by this deci|&s;ion
of the moral &s;en&s;e, their condition is not ren|dered
wor&s;e than it has been many years. Nor
need any one be alarmed; for care and attention
will &s;ecure every proprietor from &s;uffering in that
manner.</P>
<P>How wi&s;ely is this matter ordered! The na|ture
<PB N="232" REF="245">
of man would be imperfect with re&s;pect to
the goods of fortune, were a &s;ubject pa&s;&s;ing
from a man without his con&s;ent, exempted from
commerce as long as it is pre&s;erved in memory.
At that rate, property would re&s;t upon a very
crazy foundation: no man could be &s;ecure of a
&s;ubject, though purcha&s;ed by him in the faire&s;t
manner: he would always be in dread of latent
claims; and he would never think of improve|ments.
And yet, upon land depend all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries,
and mo&s;t of the conveniences, of li|ving.
The goods of fortune are be&s;towed on
man for his well-being; and it would contradict
the de&s;igns of Providence, to withdraw any
&s;ubject from commerce, &s;o as to be u&s;eful to
no per&s;on. Con&s;ent therefore is not the only
means for transferring property: the law of na|ture
&s;u&s;tains a <HI>bona fide</HI> purcha&s;e with long po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
as a good title; though it was derived <HI>a
non domino.</HI> There is perhaps at this day, not
a &s;ingle foot of land po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon a better title;
for who is it that can &s;how a chain of uninter|rupted
conveyances from the fir&s;t occupant?</P>
<P>The time nece&s;&s;ary for transferring pro|perty
without con&s;ent, depends on circum&s;tan|ces,
which are different in different ca&s;es. But
utility requires, that a preci&s;e time be fixed to
take place in every ca&s;e, otherwi&s;e law-&s;uits in
matters of pre&s;cription would be endle&s;s. As this
cannot be done by the law of nature, which gives
<PB N="233" REF="246">
to every circum&s;tance its due weight, it is left to
municipal law. All that can be &s;aid in general is,
that for the &s;ake of peace, the intere&s;t of the pre|&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or ought to be chiefly regarded in &s;ix|ing
the time. If the former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or be cut out
when he &s;till retains hope of recovering the &s;ub|ject,
it &s;eldom happens without negligence on his
part.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>bona fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ubject, whe|ther
moveable or immoveable, continued &s;o long
as to produce in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or an affection for it
as his own, is, in the law of nature, one mode of
acquiring property. And as property is in this
ca&s;e acquired without deriving right from the for|mer
proprietor, the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or is con&s;equent|ly
&s;ecure again&s;t every claim of property. He
may &s;afely admit, that the claimant was formerly
proprietor; but he urges it as a principle of the
law of nature, and as e&s;&s;ential to the well-being of
&s;ociety, that men be &s;ecure in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, ho|ne&s;tly
acquired. The right of an individual yields
here to public utility, as every &s;uch right ought
to do.</P>
<P>That the &s;en&s;e of property is finely tempered,
to produce all the good po&s;&s;ible with the lea&s;t hurt,
will appear as follows. In the fir&s;t place, as po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of land or of moveables in common is un|friendly
to indu&s;try and improvement, man is di&s;|po&s;ed
by nature to appropriation; and every man
is protected in his lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by the &s;en&s;e
<PB N="234" REF="247">
of property, and by the moral &s;en&s;e. In the
next place, as land and its product are de&s;tined
for the u&s;e of men, every man is intitled to lay
hold of what is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upplying his wants.
But as all men are by nature equal, no man is
intitled to cut out others, by occupying more
than he has u&s;e for If he could ju&s;tly occupy
more, avarice would have no bounds: the fir&s;t
&s;avage who landed in Britain, might claim the
whole i&s;land as his pr$perty<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It &s;eems to be an e&s;tabli&s;hed law among European nations, That new land belongs to the &s;tate by who&s;e &s;ubjects it is di&s;covered; and that to a&s;certain the pro|perty, no more is nece&s;&s;ary but a cro&s;s, or &s;ome other memorial of the occupation.

A man who &s;ettles upon a field that belongs to none, becomes proprietor; but &s;ymbolical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion will confer no right, either on the per&s;on who u&s;es the &s;ymbol, or on the &s;tate who&s;e &s;ubject he is. To acquire the property, and to exclude others, there mu&s;t be real occupation. Nor will real occupation appropriate more than what may be &s;ufficient for the man and his family: the re|mainder lies open to new adventurers.</NOTE>. In the third
place, as transference of property by permuta|tion,
buying and &s;elling, and other covenants, is
e&s;&s;ential in &s;ociety, con&s;ent with delivery are the
ordinary means for producing that effect. But if
con&s;ent were indi&s;pen&s;able for di&s;&s;olving the rela|tion
of property, &s;ubjects would be often left <HI>in
medio,</HI> abandoned by the proprietor, and yet
<PB N="235" REF="248">
<HI>extra commercium</HI> as to others. The law of na|ture
has more wi&s;ely regulated property for the
public good. A man lo&s;es his property, when
his hope of recovery is at an end; and the &s;ub|ject
lies open to the fir&s;t occupant. And even
where he retains his property <HI>animo,</HI> it is how|ever
transferred to the per&s;on who attains po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<HI>bona fide</HI> upon a title of property, and
who has contracted an affection for the &s;ubject
by long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The laws of property are
thus calculated, to produce the greate&s;t good po&s;|&s;ible
with the lea&s;t hurt. Without pre&s;cription,
property would often prove a &s;nare to entrap the
innocent.</P>
<P>We proceed to examine, whether, by the
law of nature, other rights be lo&s;t by time, as
well as a right of property. An obligation is a
relation between two per&s;ons, one who has a
right to claim, termed <HI>obligee,</HI> and one who is
&s;ubjected to the claim, termed <HI>obligor.</HI> When
the relation of property wears out of memory,
it is di&s;&s;olved, and is at an end as if it never had
exi&s;ted. The &s;ame holds naturally with re&s;pect
to an obligation. Let us next &s;uppo&s;e, that the
obligee retains &s;ome faint memory of the obliga|tion.
Even in this ca&s;e, if he have negligently
been long &s;ilent, he will find it again&s;t con|&s;cience,
to give di&s;turbance to the obligor who
lias acquired a conviction of freedom. A pro|prietor
is deprived of his &s;ubject, by &s;uffer|ing
<PB N="236" REF="249">
another to po&s;&s;e&s;s it <HI>bona fide</HI> for a long
cour&s;e of time; and the conviction of freedom
ought to have the &s;ame effect in law with the con|viction
of property. The obligee indeed is in that
ca&s;e deprived of his claim; but it is a le&s;s hard&s;hip
that he &s;hould &s;uffer by his negligence, than that
his party &s;hould &s;uffer who has been in no degree
culpable. A man, diving into the charter-che&s;t
of his ance&s;tor, finds evidence of an obligation
which he is &s;en&s;ible the obligor is ignorant of.
If not more ancient than forty or fifty years, he
will probably think his claim not unju&s;t, even
&s;uppo&s;ing the obligor to be in &s;traitened circum|&s;tances.
But every year beyond, he will find it
more and more again&s;t con&s;cience to di&s;tre&s;s a
family, who for many years have had not the
lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of &s;uch a claim.</P>
<P>In thus limiting the endurance of obligations,
the moral &s;en&s;e is wi&s;ely adju&s;ted to our exter|nal
circum&s;tances. A man of prudence regulates
his expence by his fortune; and is approved by
all, if he exceed not his annual income. But
were he laid open to debts contracted by a re|mote
predece&s;&s;or, and long neglected, it would
often prove a &s;evere forfeiture, reducing him
from ea&s;e and affluence to bitter mi&s;ery. He
would have a feeling of inju&s;tice, and be provo|ked
to exclaim again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion of law. If
the obligation be revived, the benefit to the cre|ditor
will bear no proportion to the &s;uffering of
<PB N="237" REF="250">
the debtor; for pain pierces deeper than plea|&s;ure,
and its impre&s;&s;ion is of longer endurance.
A man who &s;uffers by his own negligence, has
no ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint.</P>
<P>As negligence is thus a capital circum&s;tance in
the di&s;&s;olving obligations by length of time, it
ought carefully to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from delay.
What if the creditor be reduced to a &s;ituation
that di&s;ables him to make a demand, till the
debtor, or his heirs, have acquired a conviction
of freedom? He has been a &s;lave in Algiers
many years; or has been long in hiding, to pre|vent
a criminal pro&s;ecution for his life. In &s;uch
ca&s;es, there is delay, but not negligence. It is
hard indeed on the debtor to have his effects
torn from him for payment of a &s;um he never rec|koned
on: but in a competition between two
individuals, where the public is not concerned,
ju&s;tice ought always to prevail over hard&s;hip.</P>
<P>But now &s;uppo&s;ing negligence on the creditor's
part, what will be the re&s;ult where the claim is
retained in memory by the debtor? This ca&s;e
coincides with that of a <HI>mala fide</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, who
never can acquire the property by any length of
time. The creditor's negligence will not excu&s;e
the debtor, who ought to have prevented that ne|gligence
by payment. Nor would it be excu&s;able
in a court of law, to &s;u&s;tain a defence made a|gain&s;t
con&s;cience.</P>
<P>The obligations that are cut down by the law
<PB N="238" REF="251">
of nature, are tho&s;e only which are intended to
be made in&s;tantly effectual, or within a time &s;pe|cified.
In &s;uch, every hour's delay in demand|ing
performance, is a lo&s;s to the obligee; and
con&s;equently a proof of his negligence. Alter|native
obligations are in a different predicament.
Where a man provides to him&s;elf an option of
demanding one thing or another, and is not by
the covenant confined as to time; his delay may
proceed from difficulty in making a choice, and
therefore is no proof of negligence. Nor can
the obligor ever acquire from &s;uch delay a con|viction
of freedom. It is hard indeed for an ob|ligor
to be kept in &s;u&s;pen&s;e for ever; but he has
him&s;elf only to blame, for he might have limited
a time for the option.</P>
<P>A conditional obligation is nearly allied to one
that is alternative. It may not always be in the
power of the obligee to perform the condition;
or it may not always be his intere&s;t: and there|fore,
delay in demanding performance, does not
nece&s;&s;arily infer negligence. Take the following
example. A lucrative office in the King's court,
makes me think of erecting a magnificent hou&s;e
near the palace; but not being perfectly re&s;olved,
the proprietor of a piece of ground agrees to let
me have it at a certain &s;um, whenever I &s;hall
find it convenient to build. Perceiving a decli$$e
in favour, I he&s;itate, and delay building till $word$
how matters will turn out. As there is here $word$
<PB N="239" REF="252">
negligence on my part, my he&s;itation and delay
can afford no conviction of freedom to my party,
or to his repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>A right acquired by convenant over the per&s;on
or over the property of another, to be exerci&s;ed
or not according to my fancy or my intere&s;t,
comes under the &s;ame predicament. A rever&s;ion
in a &s;ale of land is a proper example. It is not
always in my power to repay the price; and it
may &s;ometimes not be my intere&s;t. Therefore,
the longe&s;t delay in demanding back my land,
will be no proof of negligence on my part,
nor afford to the purcha&s;er any rational convic|tion
that I am never to make the demand. A
power to revoke a donation between hu&s;band and
wife, a power to burden, a power to alter a &s;et|tlement,
are of the &s;ame nature. A man can
never be deprived of &s;uch a power, unle&s;s he be
limited within a time certain.</P>
<P>In order to give a ju&s;t notion of our acts con|cerning
the pre&s;cription of forty years, I found
it indi&s;pen&s;able to examine with attention what
the law of nature, or, in other words, common
law, dictates upon that &s;ubject. And having
thus paved the way, I proceed to a commentary
on the&s;e acts.</P>
<P>Pre&s;cription is of two kinds; one that relates
to property, and one that relates to obligations.
The former is termed by our writers <HI>Po&s;itive
Pre&s;cription,</HI> the latter <HI>Negative Pre&s;cription.</HI>
<PB N="240" REF="253">
The&s;e terms are intelligible; and may pa&s;s in
law-writings, though &s;carce agreeable to the ana|logy
of language. Negative pre&s;cription is ju&s;tly
defined to be the di&s;&s;olution of an obligation by
length of time. Po&s;itive pre&s;cription is defined,
the acqui&s;ition of a &s;ubject by length of time.
The latter definition holds with re&s;pect to a move|able
&s;ubject; but we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee, that in the
law of Scotland po&s;itive pre&s;cription has a very
different meaning with re&s;pect to land. I begin
with Negative Pre&s;cription, as in &s;ome mea&s;ure
preparatory to the other.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Negative Pre&s;cription.</HEAD>
<P>THE time nece&s;&s;ary for completing negative
pre&s;cription, varies according to circum&s;tances,
&s;ome regarding the per&s;ons intere&s;ted, &s;ome the
nature of the obligation; and therefore is left by
the law of nature of judges, who&s;e province it
would be, in every particular ca&s;e, to proportion
the time to the circum&s;tances. But as &s;uch lati|tude
would render judges arbitrary and law|&s;uits
endle&s;s, it was wi&s;ely done by our legi&s;la|ture,
to fix a time that &s;hould be a rule in every
ca&s;e; and accordingly forty years is made the
rule by act 28. parl. 1469. A &s;horter time would
cramp people in the management of their affairs:
a longer time is unnece&s;&s;ary; for as forty years
<PB N="241" REF="254">
exceed the ordinary remembrance of man, they
are in effect equivalent to the longe&s;t duration.
The act declares, &startq;That if an obligation be al|lowed
to lie over forty years without a pur&s;uit,
it &s;hall be of no avail.&endq; The law of nature li|berates
a debtor, who, by his creditor's negli|gence,
has acquired a conviction of freedom.
Nothing was left to our legi&s;lature, but to accom|modate
the law of nature to practice, by fixing
the time of pre&s;umed remembrance, within which
an obligation mu&s;t be put in &s;uit.</P>
<P>Little acquainted with the law of nature are
they, who hold pre&s;cription to be a creature of
municipal law<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Grotius <HI>De jure belli ac pacis,</HI> lib. 2. cap. 4. &s;ect. 1.</NOTE>: which leads to another error,
that negative pre&s;cription is a puni&s;hment inflict|ed
by municipal law on a creditor for neglecting
to pro&s;ecute his claim. Negligence is not a &s;ub|ject
of puni&s;hment; nor is it the intention of the
act 1469, to inflict a puni&s;hment on the creditor
for his negligence. It favours indeed a debtor,
who, by the forbearance, or perhaps negligence,
of his creditor, has acquired a conviction of free|dom;
which con&s;equently renders the obligation
of no avail. But if this be a puni&s;hment, every
man is puni&s;hed who &s;uffers another to take the
&s;tart of him in diligence.</P>
<P>I dare not affirm, that the deci&s;ions of the
court of &s;e&s;&s;ion have no taint of the&s;e errors.
<PB N="242" REF="255">
Though the act 1469, adhering to the law of
nature, has no view but to fix a time for ne|gative
pre&s;cription, our judges, holding erro|neou&s;ly
the act to be correctory of the law of na|ture
and not a confirmation of it, did not ven|ture
at fir&s;t to go a &s;ingle &s;tep beyond the preci&s;e
letter of the law. From the words, &startq;That an
obligation &s;hall pre&s;cribe within forty years,&endq;
it was held, that monolateral obligations only are
comprehended, and that a mutual contract is
not<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Durie, 26th February 1622, Hamilton <HI>contra</HI> Lord Sinclair.</NOTE>. The &s;ame error led the court to judge,
that after pre&s;cription of forty years, the defend|ant
is not bound to give his oath whether the
debt be re&s;ting owing; and though he &s;hould
confe&s;s it, that he is not <HI>in foro humano</HI> li|able
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fountainhall, 7th December 1703, Napier <HI>contra</HI> Campbell.</NOTE> Was it the opinion of the judges, that
forbearance or negligence is declared a crime
by the act, and puni&s;hed accordingly? Was
it their opinion, that they were tied down by the
act to commit inju&s;tice, by &s;u&s;taining a de|fence
in&s;i&s;ted on again&s;t con&s;cience? Was it
their opinion, that the creditor's negligence will
ju&s;tify the debtor for refu&s;ing to pay a &s;um he
knows to be due? The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion came in
time to entertain more correct views with re&s;pect
to this &s;tatute. Di&s;covering that it is founded on
common law, or, which is the &s;ame, on the law
<PB N="243" REF="256">
of nature; they extended it to every ca&s;e that
falls under its &s;pirit and intendment. They
extended it to te&s;taments: they extended it
to a reduction on the head of deathbed, and
to every reduction; to tacks, and to &s;ervi|tudes
real and per&s;onal: they extended it to
contracts, not excepting contracts of marriage,
where there is a mutual delay of performance.
But what it a contract be kept alive by the mino|rity
of one of the parties? He may demand per|formance,
but not unle&s;s he perform what is in|cumbent
on him; for interruption of the negative
pre&s;cription on his part, cannot have the effect to
change a mutual contract into a monolateral obli|gation.
It would have been too great a &s;tretch
to extend the act to heritable bonds; con&s;ider|ing,
that at the period of the act, they were a
&s;pecies of wad&s;et, and not obligations for pay|ment
of money. It required therefore another
&s;tatute to make heritable bonds, and other land|&s;ecurities,
fall by the negative pre&s;cription. And
this was done in the &s;econd head of the act 12.
parl. 1617. The words are, &startq;And &s;icklike his
Maje&s;ty &s;tatutes and ordains, That all actions
upon heritable bonds, rever&s;ions, contracts, or
others what&s;omever, &s;hall be pur&s;ued within
the &s;pace of forty years after the date of the
&s;ame.&endq; The contracts here mentioned mu&s;t
be under&s;tood to be contracts concerning land;
one of which is mentioned, viz. a rever&s;ion:
<PB N="244" REF="257">
with re&s;pect to other contracts, there was no oc|ca&s;ion
for a new &s;tatute. A right of property,
whether of land, or of a moveable, differs &s;o
widely from a <HI>jus crediti,</HI> and even from a right
burdening land, that it was never under&s;tood to
be comprehended in either of the two &s;tatutes
e&s;tabli&s;hing negative pre&s;cription. And there|fore,
though a right of property cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t
for ever without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; yet the time of its
endurance is limited by the law of nature only
as above mentioned, nor by either of the&s;e &s;ta|tutes.</P>
<P>As the debtor's conviction of freedom ari&s;ing
from the creditor's forbearing to make a demand,
is the foundation of the negative pre&s;cription, the
act 1469 requires a document to be taken by the
creditor, in order to awaken the debtor out of
his dream of &s;ecurity. No activity on the cre|ditor's
part will be &s;ufficient, but what has the
effect of an interpellation to the debtor. An ob|ligation
may be the &s;ubject of conveyances from
hand to hand, and may be brought into a &s;um|mons,
or even into letters of horning: yet if the
debtor have not been interpelled, he is free after
forty years. It has accordingly been found oft|ener
than once, that regi&s;tration alone does not
interrupt<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Spotti&s;woode, <HI>Pre&s;cription,</HI> 27th November 1630, Lord Borthwick <HI>contra</HI> Smeiton; Stair, 12th January 1672, John&s;ton <HI>Contra</HI> Lord Belhaven.</NOTE>. Nor was even regi&s;tration with let|ters
<PB N="245" REF="258">
to horning, found &s;ufficient, becau&s;e it re|quires
a charge to interpel the debtor<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple, 11th December 1717, Wright <HI>contra</HI> Wright of Ker&s;e.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is implied in the act 1469, that the negative
pre&s;cription &s;hould not begin to run but from the
term of payment; becau&s;e till that term be elap|&s;ed,
a demand cannot be made, nor a document
be taken on the obligation, as expre&s;&s;ed in the
&s;tatute. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the negative pre&s;crip|tion
of an action of warrandice, is, in the &s;tatute
1617, declared not to commence from the date of
the obligation of warrandice, but from the time
of the di&s;tre&s;s. Yet with re&s;pect to an heritable
bond, the negative pre&s;cription is declared, in the
&s;ame &s;tatute, to commence from the date. Why
this difference? An heritable bond was at that
time a &s;pecies of wad&s;et: it contained no obliga|tion
for payment, and con&s;equently no term of
payment. But as an heritable bond contains
now an obligation to pay, and a term of pay|ment,
the negative pre&s;cription will not begin to
run again&s;t it before that term.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved above, in tracing the law of na|ture,
that if the creditor have been prevented
from doing diligence, pre&s;cription will not run a|gain&s;t
him. Negligence cannot be imputed to a
creditor during the time of his &s;lavery in Tunis
or Algiers. Hence <HI>Non valens agere</HI> is a fact that
interrupts the negative pre&s;cription. For a &s;imi|lar
<PB N="246" REF="259">
rea&s;on, minority is and interruption: a minor
is not under&s;tood to be acquainted with his own
affairs; and therefore his &s;ilence will not be im|puted
to him for a $ault.</P>
<P>Neither by the law of nature, nor by &s;tatute,
do any obligations fall by negative pre&s;cription,
unle&s;s where the creditor mu&s;t blame him&s;elf for
negligence in delaying to make a demand. Of that
nature are pure obligations, intended to be made
in&s;tantly effectual, or within a time &s;pecified;
where delay is a lo&s;s to the obligee, and con&s;e|quently
a proof of his negligence. But there are
obligations which it may be the intere&s;t of the
creditor to delay for a long or a &s;hort time. Three
kinds of the&s;e are mentioned above, alternative
obligations that give an option to the obligee,
conditional obligations, and obligations that be|&s;tow
a privilege on the obligee to act, or not to
act, at this plea&s;ure. And as with re&s;pect to
the&s;e our &s;tatutes differ not from the law of na|ture,
all that remains for me, is to illu&s;trate this
doctrine by a few additional examples. A man
lends L. 1000 to bear intere&s;t, and &s;tipulates to
him&s;elf an option, to demand back the &s;um, or
a farm belonging to the debtor, reckoned of e|qual
value. This is an example of the fir&s;t kind.
Here delay in making the option is not a proof
of negligence, for it may proceed from irre&s;olu|tion;
and therefore an obligation of this kind
falls not by the negative pre&s;cription. Take the
<PB N="247" REF="260">
following examples of a conditional obligation.
I take an obligation from a neighbour, to allow
me the u&s;e of his water for a bleachfield that I
intend to erect. Being in expectation of a coal|mine,
I take an obligation from a neighbour, to
allow me a road through his ground for my coal|waggons.
With re&s;pect to &s;uch obligations, it is
not always my intere&s;t to demand immediate per|formance.
The bleachfield may require more
money than I have to &s;pare at pre&s;ent: it may be
prudent to delay an expen&s;ive operation on my
coal, till the coal about me become &s;carce. De|lay
in the&s;e ca&s;es is not the effect of negligence,
but of prudence. A &s;ale of land under rever&s;ion,
is a proper example of the third kind. If the re|ver&s;er
be not limited as to time by covenant,
he may demand back his land at any time, up|on
offering to re&s;tore the price. It is implied in
the very nature of the bargain, that the right of re|ver&s;ion
&s;hould not fall by the negative pre&s;cription;
and accordingly it is expre&s;sly excepted from that
pre&s;cription in the &s;econd head of the act 1617.
But &s;hall it be in the power of the rever&s;er to keep
the purcha&s;er in &s;u&s;pen&s;e for ever? Equity af|fords
a remedy. It is again&s;t the public intere&s;t,
as well as again&s;t the intere&s;t of the purcha&s;er,
that his land &s;hould be put <HI>extra commercium.</HI>
After the rever&s;ion has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted forty or fifty
years, why &s;hould not a declarator be competent
to the purcha&s;er; concluding, that the court
<PB N="248" REF="261">
ought to name a time for claiming upon the re|ver&s;ion,
after which the rever&s;ion &s;hall be at an
end? And there is great equity for applying the
&s;ame remedy to the other ca&s;es mentioned. A
power to revoke a donation between hu&s;band and
wife, a power to burden, a power to alter a &s;et|tlement,
are al&s;o examples of the third kind.
But as the&s;e powers are per&s;onal, they die with
the per&s;on who has them; and a court of equity,
therefore, will not interpo&s;e to limit them to a
&s;horter time. Such powers are di&s;tingui&s;hed in
our law by the appellation of <HI>Res merae faculta|tis.</HI></P>
<P>There is another &s;pecies of rights and privile|ges
more properly termed <HI>res merae facultatis,</HI>
becau&s;e they concern the privileged per&s;on only,
and affect not others; &s;uch as my chu&s;ing a &s;pot
for a kitchen-garden, planting a tree, or building
a hou&s;e at my march. It is the purpo&s;e of the
negative pre&s;cription to relive the obligor from a
burden; but here no per&s;on is burdened. Such
rights therefore may be exerci&s;ed <HI>quandocunque.</HI>
Thus, I can take up a title of honour, or &s;erve
heir to a predece&s;&s;or, at any di&s;tance of time.
Others may be affected con&s;equentially; but no
per&s;on &s;uffers directly.</P>
<P>There are certain duties and re&s;traints impo&s;ed
upon individuals, not for behoof of other indivi|duals,
but for behoof of the public. The public
there &s;tands as the obligee; and pre&s;cription o|perates
<PB N="249" REF="262">
not again&s;t the public. Such re&s;traints
however do not always an&s;wer the end propo&s;ed;
and though they fall not by the forty years pre|&s;cription,
yet if there be a total forbearance for a
very long time, they fall into di&s;u&s;e, and cea&s;e to
bind.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the &s;ubjects that fall not under
negative pre&s;cription, we proceed to its opera|tions
on &s;ubjects that fall under it. I begin with
annual pre&s;tations; of which the intere&s;t payable
yearly on a bond of borrowed money, is an ex|ample.
After forty years the bond falls as to
the principal &s;um; but does it al&s;o fall as to the
intere&s;t that became due within the forty years?
The purpo&s;e of the negative pre&s;cription is to
quiet the minds to people, by &s;ecuring them a|gain&s;t
antiquanted claims. As no document has
been taken on the bond for forty years, the &s;ta|tute
declares, that it &s;hall be of no avail. Now
if the bond be of no avail, it cannot be the foun|dation
of an action for any of its provi&s;ions or ar|ticles.
Add a &s;eparate argument, That the bond
may have been forged, or liable to &s;ome other
total objection, the evidence of which is lo&s;t by
length of time. In the Roman law accordingly
the intere&s;t, as well as the principal, were cut
down by the negative pre&s;cription. &startq;Eos qui

vary the ca&s;e a little, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, that the
debtor becomes bound to pay the &s;um borrowed,
not at one term, but at two terms. The credi|tor
makes a demand, in le&s;s than forty years af|ter
the &s;econd moiety became due. The doubt
here is, that pre&s;cription begins not to run but
from the term of payment. Here there are two
terms of payment; and if we compute the forty
years from the latter, pre&s;cription has not run,
at lea&s;t of the moiety la&s;t payable. On the o|ther
hand, there has been a delay of forty years
from the time that action was competent for pay|ment
of the fir&s;t moiety; and the bond may
have been kept latent to prevent objections. Mo|ved
by the&s;e rea&s;ons, it &s;eems the &s;afer &s;ide to
&s;u&s;tain the pre&s;cription. And the court appears
to have been of the &s;ame opinion in the follow|ing
ca&s;e. A widow having lived forty years af|ter
her hu&s;band, without demanding her annuity,
her repre&s;entatives in&s;i&s;ted for the annuities that
<PB N="251" REF="264">
aro&s;e within the forty years. The right of liferent
it&s;elf was found to be pre&s;cribed; and the defence
of pre&s;cription was &s;u&s;tained with re&s;pect to the
annuities claimed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Forbes, 6th July 1711, Stewart <HI>contra</HI> Children of Cummin of Pitoulie.</NOTE> They gave a different judge|ment
in the following ca&s;e. Though a bond of
pen&s;ion granted to an advocate had lain over for|ty
years, without any document being taken
on it; yet a claim for the yearly pen&s;ions that
fell due within the forty years was &s;u&s;tained to
the advocate's repre&s;entatives<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">July 1730, Lockhart <HI>contra</HI> Duke of Gordon.</NOTE>. This would
have been right, had every year's pen&s;ion been
contained in a bond by it&s;elf. Thus, as to the
negative pre&s;cription of annual pre&s;tations, the fol|lowing
conclu&s;ions appear well founded. Fir&s;t,
That if the obligation it&s;elf be cut off by pre&s;crip|tion,
none of its acce&s;&s;ories can &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Second,
That a document taken upon the obligation,
pre&s;erves it entire with all its acce&s;&s;ories.</P>
<P>As a right to tithes is a right of property, it
falls not by negative pre&s;cription. But arrears
beyond forty years fall under it. A claim for feu|duties
is preci&s;ely &s;imilar.</P>
<P>The ca&s;es of negative pre&s;cription that are the
mo&s;t intricate, ari&s;e from obligations where there
are more than one creditor, or more than one
debtor. As the purpo&s;e of the &s;tatue is mere|ly
<PB N="252" REF="265">
to fix the time of pre&s;cription, &s;uch ca&s;es are
left to common law. The following examples re|late
to co-creditors. An a&s;&s;ignment to a bond of
borrowed money lies over forty years without
being intimated to the debtor; but during part
of the time, the cedent's heir was minor. If
the a&s;&s;ignee in&s;i&s;t for payment in his own name,
the negative pre&s;cription will meet him: but he
may in&s;i&s;t in name of the cedent's heir; and up|on
a proof of the minority, the defence of nega|tive
pre&s;cription mu&s;t be repelled. The re&s;ult
will be different where the a&s;&s;ignment is intima|ted.
By that intimation the cedent is complete|ly
denuded: the a&s;&s;ignee mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t in his own
name; and if forty years have elap&s;ed &s;ince the
intimation, the debtor is free. In a competition
for mails and duties between two real creditors,
one had right to an appri&s;ing by a di&s;po&s;ition,
and the other had right to the &s;ame appri&s;ing
by an adjudication. The di&s;ponee was prefer|able;
but had done no diligence for forty years:
the adjudger had pre&s;erved his right entire by di|ligence.
The adjudger was preferred to the
mails and duties *. This is a ca&s;e <HI>in apicibus
juris.</HI> One thing is clear, that the debtor, if
left at liberty, has it in his power to prefer either
of the competitors at his plea&s;ure. He can put
the di&s;ponee out of the field, by pleading the ne|gative<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">26th November 1728, Fra&s;er <HI>contra</HI> Mackenzie.</NOTE>
<PB N="253" REF="266">
pre&s;cription; and then the adjudger, left
without a competitor, can levy the mails and du|ties:
or he may forbear to plead the negative pre|&s;cription
again&s;t the di&s;ponee; who con&s;equently
will levy the mails and duties upon his prefer|able
right. But equity will not &s;uffer &s;uch game
to be played. The debtor has no intere&s;t to
plead the negative pre&s;cription, becau&s;e, in all e|vents,
the mails and duties mu&s;t be paid to one
or other of the competitors: he may therefore
be ju&s;tly &s;et a&s;ide as having no concern in the
que&s;tion; and when he is out of the field, the
di&s;ponee mu&s;t be preferred, as having the prefer|able
right. This is one of many ca&s;es that is bet|ter
fitted for the &s;ilence of a &s;tudy, than for the
bu&s;tle of a court of law.</P>
<P>An infeftment of annualrent is conveyed, in
one deed, to John and James, equally betwixt
them. John's right is &s;aved from the negative
pre&s;cription, by drawing payment of intere&s;t, or
by a proce&s;s of mails and duties. James has done
nothing for forty years. John's diligence will
not &s;ave James, who has taken no document on
his claim. But then can the debtor have acqui|red
any conviction of freedom with re&s;pect to the
claim of James, which he &s;ees e&s;tabli&s;hed in the
&s;ame deed with that of John? This is a difficult
ca&s;e. James, it is true, has been negligent;
but negligence alone is not a &s;ufficient ground
for the negative pre&s;cription. I incline to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
<PB N="254" REF="267">
the original debtor from his heir or &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or.
When the original debtor is &s;ued by
James for payment after the forty years, he ought
not to be &s;uffered to plead the negative pre&s;crip|tion,
when he mu&s;t be con&s;cious, that he has not
paid a &s;hilling to James, principal or intere&s;t.
His heir or &s;ucce&s;&s;or is in a different condition.
He is warranted to plead, from the &s;ilence of
forty years, that the debt has been paid, or di&s;|charged.
This rea&s;oning is al&s;o applicable to an
adjudication di&s;poned to two per&s;ons equally.</P>
<P>Next as to co-obligants. It mu&s;t be yielded,
that a co obligant cannot rea&s;onably entertain the
&s;ame conviction of freedom from the creditor's
delay, that a &s;ingle obligant may have: the cre|ditor
may have been abundantly diligent again&s;t
the other co-obligants. But at that rate, a co-obligant
may be kept bound for ever, without e|ver
hearing of the debt, contrary to the &s;pirit of
the law of nature, or of common law. The
hard&s;hip is great, and calls for a remedy. The
remedy is ea&s;y; which is, to oblige the creditor
to take a document again&s;t each of the co-obli|gants.
Between two per&s;ons &s;o intimately con|nected
as creditor and debtor, equity certainly
rules, that the one &s;hould be relieved from a ve|ry
great hard&s;hip, impo&s;ing a very &s;light bur|den
on the other. Our deci&s;ions however, I
am &s;orry to &s;ay, &s;quare not with this conclu&s;ion.
It has frequently been found, that pre&s;cription
<PB N="255" REF="268">
is interrupted as to every co-obligant by diligence
done again&s;t any one<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Stair; Dirleton, 18th December 1667, Nicol&s;on <HI>contra</HI> Laird of Philorth; Forbes, 23d February 1714, Earl of Marchmont <HI>contra</HI> Home.</NOTE>. And an infeftment of
annualrent having been con&s;tituted upon two te|nements
by two different &s;ei&s;ins, a poinding of

to pre&s;erve the right alive upon the other tene|ment,
though they belonged to different proprie|tors
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stair, 22d June 1671, Lord Balmerino <HI>contra</HI> Ha|milton.</NOTE>. The court in the&s;e ca&s;es &s;eem to have
formed a notion, as if the negative pre&s;cription
were only intended to puni&s;h the negligence of
creditors; and con&s;equently that it cannot ope|rate
again&s;t a creditor who has in any degree
been active. It ought to have been con&s;idered,
as above mentioned, that negligence is not a
&s;ubject of puni&s;hment; and that the intendment
of negative pre&s;cription, is to quiet the minds
of people who have acquired a conviction of free|dom,
from being left undi&s;turbed forty years.
The court judged more correctly in the following
ca&s;es. A party was exempted from the juri&s;dic|tion
of a regality, having more than forty years
an&s;wered to the &s;heriff's court only, and never
once to the regality-court; though the juri&s;|diction
of regality was in con&s;tant exerci&s;e as to
<PB N="256" REF="269">
others<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Stair, 23d November 1671, Rolland <HI>contra</HI> Laird of Craigyvar.</NOTE>. The whole barony of Mu&s;&s;elburgh,
comprehending the tenement of Coldcoats, was,
by a con&s;titution in writ, thirled to the mill of
the barony, belonging to the town of Mu&s;&s;el|burgh;
and the town had been in the uninter|rupted
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole multures, tho&s;e of
Coldcoats excepted. In a declarator of thirlage,
the town of Mu&s;&s;elburgh again&s;t Wauchope of
Edmon&s;tone, proprietor of Coldcoats, negative
pre&s;cription was pleaded. An&s;wered, That the
town's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the multures of the re&s;t of the
barony, pre&s;erves their right entire as to the
whole. But the court, ju&s;tly con&s;idering that the
defendant had acquired a conviction of freedom
by the lap&s;e of forty years, &s;u&s;tained his defence
of pre&s;cription. The nature of the &s;ubject in
controver&s;y, paved the way to this judgement:
the &s;everal tenements that compo&s;e a barony are
&s;eparate &s;ubjects, and frequently not contermi|nous,
being connected only by a common char|ter;
which makes it ea&s;y to conceive, that &s;ome
of the tenements may be free, while others are
thirled. The ca&s;e is fundamentally the &s;ame in a
thirlage of <HI>omnia grana cre&s;centia.</HI> And yet,
in that thirlage the defence of pre&s;cription was
repelled with re&s;pect to the multure of bear;

<HEAD>Po&s;itive Pre&s;cription.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be proper to premi&s;e a &s;hort &s;ketch of
the Roman <HI>u&s;ucapio;</HI> becau&s;e our po&s;itive pre|&s;cription
is held to be of the &s;ame nature, by eve|ry
writer on the law of Scotland; though erro|neou&s;ly,
as &s;hall be made appear, with re&s;pect to
land. <HI>U&s;ucapio</HI> is defined, &startq;adjectio dominii
per continuationem po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ionis temporis lege
definiti<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">l. 3. De u&s;urpationibus et u&s;ucapionibus.</NOTE>.&endq; <HI>U&s;ucapio</HI> accordingly is one of
the modes of acquiring dominion or property.
The time was at fir&s;t a year in a moveable, and
two years in land; a pregnant evidence, that the
&s;en&s;e of property, &s;eparately from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was
but in its infancy when <HI>u&s;ucapio</HI> was introduced.
Property originally was lo&s;t with the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as
above hinted; and by this regulation it appears
to have been the opinion of the Romans, that
<PB N="258" REF="271">
property could not have any long endurance in|dependent
of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In the days of Ju&s;ti|nian,
when ab&s;tract ideas had become familiar, and
property was clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
three years were declared nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>u&s;ucapio</HI>
in moveables, and ten, or twenty, in different ca|&s;es,
for <HI>u&s;ucapio</HI> in land.</P>
<P>How far the Roman <HI>u&s;ucapio</HI> obtains with us
in moveables, will appear from what follows.
Fir&s;t, With re&s;pect to a moveable found by ac|cident,
that appears to have pa&s;&s;ed through the
hand of art, and which therefore mu&s;t have
been appropriated, occupancy will not transfer
the property to the finder. If the moveable have
not been lo&s;t forty years, the proprietor is pre&s;u|med
to have retained the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <HI>animo,</HI> and
he will be pre$erred to all the world. If forty
years have elap&s;ed from the time of his lo&s;s, he
is cut out, and the moveable goes to the fi&s;e.
<HI>A fortiori,</HI> it will go to the fi&s;e if no proprietor
appear; which is the ca&s;e of waith and &s;tray
goods, of wreck, of a trea&s;ure found in the
ground, &amp;c. But any of the&s;e particulars acqui|red
from a putative proprietor, will go to the ac|quirer,
upon po&s;&s;e&s;ing forty years, which com|pletes
<HI>u&s;ucapio.</HI> The former proprietor may
have retained the hope of recovery; but his right
yields to that of his competitor, who by long po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
has acquired an affection for the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>A moveable never formerly appropriated, be|longs
<PB N="259" REF="272">
to the &s;inder as the fir&s;t occupant. If it be
uncertain whether the moveable have been for|merly
appropriated or not, the finder may lay
hold of it, and the property will be his, unle&s;s
&s;ome per&s;on appear, and prove that it was for|merly
his property. If he appear &s;oon after the
new occupancy, the &s;ubject mu&s;t be re&s;tored to
him. But if the &s;inder have continued forty
years in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion upon the <HI>bona fide</HI> title of fir&s;t
occupant, the property will be transferred to him
by <HI>u&s;ucapio.</HI></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to land, our po&s;itive pre&s;cription
differs widely from the Roman <HI>u&s;ucapio.</HI> All
the lands in Scotland are under&s;tood to have flow|ed
from the &s;overeign originally; and every por|tion
of land that is abandoned by the proprietor
returns to the &s;overeign, and is not left open to
the fir&s;t occupant. If a portion of de&s;erted land
be laid hold of by a private per&s;on, no length of
time will transfer the property to him; becau&s;e
he ought to know that it belongs to the crown,
and that he can have no right.</P>
<P>Thus, before the act 12. parl. 1617, fixing
forty years for completing po&s;itive pre&s;cription,
it was nece&s;&s;ary, in a competition about the pro|perty
of land, that each of the competitors &s;hould
connect with the crown. The longe&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
without a crown-charter, yielded to &s;uch a char|ter
of the late&s;t date. For &s;ome time after wri|ting
was employed in land-property, this was no
<PB N="260" REF="273">
hard&s;hip; becau&s;e title-deeds were few, and ea&s;ily
pre&s;erved. But in a long progre&s;s from the King,
where the land has pa&s;&s;ed through many hands,
title-deeds multiply greatly; and great mu&s;t have
been the difficulty of pre&s;erving them entire du|ring
the feudal anarchy, when even the neare&s;t
neighbours entertained deadly feud again&s;t each
other. The lo&s;s however of any one connecting
title was fatal. Suppo&s;e a family-e&s;tate to have
been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed two or three centuries by connect|ed
&s;ervices; yet if the charter from the crown
was mi&s;&s;ing, the family had no defence again&s;t a
charter of ye&s;terday obtained by another from
the crown. Or &s;uppo&s;e the original charter to
have been pre&s;erved, yet any gap in the progre&s;s
might be fatal, the lo&s;s of a di&s;po&s;ition to a &s;in|gular
&s;ucce&s;&s;or, of a procuratory of re&s;ignation,
of a precept of <HI>Clare conflat,</HI> or of any other
midcouple. Nor was this all. At the period of
the act 1469, fixing the cour&s;e of the negative
pre&s;cription, writing was rare; it was confined to
notaries: and forgery was unknown. But when
writing became common, and yet not brought to
&s;uch perfection as that different hands could be
clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed, the ea&s;ine&s;s of committing a
forgery was a &s;trong temptation to de&s;igning
men. Before the &s;eventeenth century according|ly,
forgery became frequent, dangerous above
all to proprietors of land.</P>
<P>Wonderful it is, that, even among a rude
<PB N="261" REF="274">
people, a law &s;o replete with mi&s;chief to land-proprietors,
was &s;o long &s;ubmitted to. The fir&s;t
attempt to a remedy was act 214. parl. 1594, ha|ving
the following preamble: &startq;That &s;undry of
the lieges, and their predece&s;&s;ors and authors,
have bruiked their lands by infeftment for the
&s;pace of forty years: notwith&s;tanding whereof
the &s;aid infeftments are &s;undry times drawn in
que&s;tion for lack of procuratories or in&s;tru|ments
of re&s;ignation, precepts of <HI>Clare con|&s;tat,</HI>
or other precepts of &s;ei&s;in, which are not
extant, to be produced and u&s;ed, in re&s;pect
the &s;ame are tynt and amitted, partly by ini|quity
of time, partly by peri&s;hing of proto|cols,&endq;
&amp;c. For the&s;e rea&s;ons it is enacted,
That where parties, and their predece&s;&s;ors and
authors, have had a continued po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion forty
years on charter and &s;ei&s;in, they &s;hall not be
bound to produce procuratories, or in&s;tru|ments
of re&s;ignation, precepts of <HI>Clare con|&s;tat,</HI>
or other precepts of &s;ei&s;in; provided the
charter bear, that re&s;ignation was duly made,
and the in&s;trument of &s;ei&s;in make mention of
the precept.&endq; Improvements that have inve|terate
practice to &s;truggle with, are faint in their
commencement, and &s;low at fir&s;t in their pro|gre&s;s.
The remedy here was extremely faint,
as it removed but a very &s;mall part of the evils
&s;pecified above. It was however a lucky attempt,
as it paved the way to the illu&s;trious &s;tatute 1617,
<PB N="262" REF="275">
which may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as the palladium
of our land-proprietors: its rationality and ex|pedience
have been confirmed by the practice of
more than a century and a half.</P>
<P>This &s;tatute con&s;i&s;ts of two heads. The pur|po&s;e
of the fir&s;t, is to &s;ecure proprietors again&s;t
every per&s;on claiming the property. The pur|po&s;e
of the other, is to protect them again&s;t real
debts and claims affecting property. Upon the
fir&s;t head, the preamble is in effect the &s;ame with
that of the act 1594: &startq;Our Sovereign Lord
con&s;idering the great prejudice his lieges &s;u&s;|tain
in their lands and heritages, not only by
the ab&s;tracting, corrupting, and concealing
their true evidents in their minority, and by
the ami&s;&s;ion thereof through war, plague, fire,
&amp;c.; but al&s;o by the forging of fal&s;e evidents,
and concealing the &s;ame for for &s;o long a time,
as that all means of improving thereof is taken
away; whereby his lieges are con&s;titute in a
great uncertainty of their heritable rights,&endq;
&amp;c.: Therefore enacted, That po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for forty
years without interruption upon a title of proper|ty
&s;hall give an unquarrelable right, good again&s;t
all mortals, and again&s;t all objections, fal&s;ehood
only excepted. And to that end, it is declared
&s;ufficient, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or produce for his title,
either a charter and &s;ei&s;in of the land, or in&s;tru|ments
of &s;ei&s;in, one or more, continued, and
&s;tanding together, for the &s;aid &s;pace of forty years,
<PB N="263" REF="276">
proceeding either upon retours, or upon precepts
of <HI>Clare con&s;tat.</HI></P>
<P>There are two evils to which every proprietor
of land is liable. One is the hazard of lo&s;ing
title-deeds, which increa&s;es with the time of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion;
the other is the hazard of fal&s;e deeds,
keept latent till all means of detection are gone.
The &s;ame remedy is provided for both; which
is, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion forty years upon a title of pro|perty,
&s;hall be held a complete right to the land,
effectual again&s;t every competitor. This not on|ly
frees the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or from the nece&s;&s;ity of produ|cing
more ancient titles, but &s;ecures him again&s;t
antiquated claims of property, upon the &s;tatutory
pre&s;umption, that they are not true and hone&s;t
claims.</P>
<P>The &s;ecurity of land-property is the purpo&s;e
of the act 1594; and to make it &s;till more &s;ecure,
is the purpo&s;e of the fir&s;t head of the act under
con&s;ideration. In neither of the acts is there
the &s;lighte&s;t hint of depriving a man of his pro|perty
by neglect, and of transferring it to ano|ther
by peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The are founded
on the mo&s;t liberal principles of ju&s;tice: they &s;e|cure
property, after long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, again&s;t the
lo&s;s of ancient title-deeds; and they &s;ecure it a|gain&s;t
latent claims of property that may ju&s;tly be
pre&s;umed ill founded when &s;uffered to lie long
dormant. Our po&s;itive pre&s;cription of land-pro|perty,
ought to be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from
<PB N="264" REF="277">
the Roman <HI>u&s;ucapio;</HI> for there is no re&s;emblance
between them.</P>
<P>An inclination to differ from others is not a|greeable;
but I &s;tand not &s;ingle with re&s;pect to
the doctrine here inclucated. I am &s;upported
by Lord Dirleton, who breathed the true &s;pirit
of law, if any ever did. He ob&s;erves, &startq;That
the po&s;itive pre&s;cription is introduced, not &s;o
much <HI>odio et negligentia non petentis,</HI> as <HI>fa|vore
po&s;&s;identis</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dirleton's doubts,</HI> Pre&s;cription again&s;t the King.</NOTE>.&endq; How comes it then that
the &s;tatute 1617 is treated by all our writers,
Lord Dirleton only excepted, as an odious reme|dy,
depriving a man of his property without his
con&s;ent? Our law-authors were educated abroad
by profe&s;&s;ors of the Roman law; and having had
no profe&s;&s;ors at home, they were left to gather the
law of their own country by hints, &s;craps, and
occa&s;ional practice. As in &s;everal articles out
law re&s;embled that of the Romans, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
for the Roman law led our authors in&s;en&s;ibly to
adopt that law, and to pa&s;s it for our own,
where-ever they could di&s;cover any appearance of
a re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>But to return to the &s;tatute. With re&s;pect to
the fir&s;t head, it is enacted, That tho&s;e who have
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed forty years on a title of property &startq;&s;hall
never be troubled, pur&s;ued, nor inquieted, by
his Maje&s;ty, nor by any other &s;uperior or au|thor,
<PB N="265" REF="278">
nor by any other per&s;on pretending right
to the land by prior infeftments, public or pri|vate,
nor upon any other ground, rea&s;on, or
argument, except upon fal&s;ehood.&endq; The&s;e
words are plain and peremptory, admitting no
objection to the &s;tatutory title but &s;ingly that of
fal&s;ehood; an exception that &s;carce needed to
have been mentioned, becau&s;e a fal&s;e title is no
title: it is a title in appearance only, not in rea|lity.
We are authori&s;ed by the &s;tatute to pre|&s;ume
every thing in favour of long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.
The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's ancient titles connecting him with
the crown, may have been lo&s;t: his competitor's
titles may have been forged; or &s;uppo&s;ing them
true deeds, he may have been denuded, forty
years ago, in favour of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, or of tho&s;e
he connects with. In a word, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion forty
years on a title of property, is declared, by the
&s;tatute, to be a complete title to land, that mu&s;t
prevail in every competition. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has
no occa&s;ion to plead negative pre&s;cription, or a|ny
other ground, again&s;t his competitor's right;
he need &s;ay no more but that his own title is pre|ferable.
The law of pre&s;cription is in every part
con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf. Land-property, as ob&s;er|ved
above, is not &s;ubjected to negative pre&s;crip|tion
by our &s;tatutes; and if after forty years a
claim of property could be &s;u&s;tained again&s;t the
party in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the po&s;itive pre&s;cription would
afford no &s;ecurity: the act 1617 would be an idle
<PB N="266" REF="279">
attempt, without &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;tatute is guilty of
no blunder: it &s;ecures the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or again&s;t every
claim of property, public or private, without
needing the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the negative pre&s;cription.
And it makes no difference, whether the compe|ting
title be proof again&s;t the negative pre&s;crip|tion
<HI>&s;ua natura,</HI> or be kept alive by a <HI>non va|lentia
agendi,</HI> or by minority, or by any other
means. If it be urged, that an innocent per&s;on
ought not to be forfeited of a ju&s;t claim; I an|&s;wer,
that a claim latent forty years is ju&s;tly &s;u&s;|pected
of having been kept in the dark in order
to evade detection; and therefore is not a ju&s;t
claim. But po&s;&s;ibly the claimant may have been
<HI>non valens agere</HI> the whole forty years, or part
of them. This ca&s;e is extremely favourable for
the claimant; and yet even here, the right of
an individual ought to yield to public utility.
The &s;tatute, in preferring the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, has acted
by an equitable rule, That where public utility is
at variance with the intere&s;t of an individual, the
former ought to prevail. Nor is more done in
the &s;tatute, than is commonly practi&s;ed even by a
court of equity<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Principles of Equity, conclu&s;ion of book 2.</NOTE>. The public utility here is ob|vious.
Were any excu&s;e to be &s;u&s;tained to one
who claims the property for not appearing with|in
the forty years, the &s;alutary purpo&s;e of the
&s;tatute would, in a great mea&s;ure, be fru&s;trated.
<PB N="267" REF="280">
The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or might be troubled, pur&s;ued, and
inquieted, not for forty years only, but for four
hundred. And as there can be no record of a
<HI>non valentia agendi,</HI> of minority, nor of many
other interruptions, the record could be little de|pended
on in making a purcha&s;e of land. It is
hard indeed to make the po&s;itive pre&s;cription o|perate
in &s;uch ca&s;es: but it is a maxim in law,
as well as in politics, That a &s;mall evil ought to
be &s;ubmitted to for preventing a greater; and
there cannot be a greater evil than uncertainty a|bout
the property of land, which would bar all
improvements.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to minority, in particular, it is
ju&s;tly protected again&s;t the negative pre&s;cription;
the declared purpo&s;e of which is, to render a
claim &s;u&s;picious, and to cut it down, becau&s;e it
is not pro&s;ecuted in time: now &s;uch neglect can|not
be attributed to a minor, who is not &s;uppo|&s;ed
to have any knowledge of his own affaris.
In the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion accordingly, minority is
&s;u&s;tained as an interruption of the negative pre|&s;cription;
though the act 1469 declares in gene|ral,
that obligations &s;hall be of no avail after for|ty
years, unle&s;s a document be taken upon them;
without any mention of minority as an excep|tion.
The po&s;itive pre&s;cription is very different.
In a competition among creditors, minority af|fords
no privilege: the &s;lighte&s;t defect of form is
available again&s;t a minor, as well as again&s;t one
<PB N="268" REF="281">
of full age, to po&s;tone him to other creditors.
And the &s;ame rule ought to hold in a competi|tion
about the property of land.</P>
<P>I give peculiar attention to the ca&s;e of minori|ty,
as I reckon upon &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t
me from the deci&s;ions of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion;
though all of them, as far as I know, are of a
late date. The fir&s;t ca&s;e where minority was
found to be privileged again&s;t the po&s;itive pre|&s;cription,
is Hamilton-Blair of that Ilk <HI>contra</HI>
Feuers of Ker&s;eland<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">6th December 1754.</NOTE>. Hamilton-Blair having
right as patron to the teinds of the pari&s;h of Dal|ry,
brought a proce&s;s again&s;t the feuers of Ker&s;e|land,
for payment of the teinds of their lands.
The defendants produced charters and &s;ei&s;ins
from Ker of Ker&s;eland containing an heritable right
to the teinds of the lands, upon which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
was continued forty years without interruption.
The pur&s;uer an&s;wered, That the po&s;itive pre|&s;cription
was interrupted by his minority; and
the reply was, That minority interrupts not the
po&s;itive pre&s;cription. The que&s;tion was thought
worty of a &s;olemn pleading; and the following
judgement was the re&s;ult. &startq;The Lords find,
That the years of minority mu&s;t be deducted
from the years of po&s;itive pre&s;cription.&endq; The
pur&s;uer's coun&s;el pleaded the ca&s;e, as if our po|&s;itive
pre&s;cription were the &s;ame with the Ro|man
<PB N="269" REF="282">
<HI>u&s;ucapio,</HI> where one man lo&s;es his right
<HI>non utendo,</HI> and another acquires it <HI>utendo.</HI>
Were our po&s;itive pre&s;cription of that kind, mi|nority
would be an effectual interruption; for,
in the Roman <HI>u&s;ucapio,</HI> one cannot acquire a
&s;ubject by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till the former proprietor
have lo&s;t it by dereliction, re&s;embling our nega|tive
pre&s;cription, which runs not again&s;t a minor.
But it is cleared above, that po&s;itive pre&s;cription
in Scotland, is entirely independent of the nega|tive;
and that po&s;itive pre&s;cription, being a com|plete
title, is exclu&s;ive of every other title. The
judges divided on this que&s;tion. Such of them
as were for the judgement, did not enter into the
di&s;tinction between po&s;itive and negative pre&s;crip|tion
with re&s;pect to minority: they &s;uffered them|&s;elves
to be led by the authority of Stair and
Mackenzie, and by the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of common
opinion. This judgement paved the way to an|other,
given lately, in the ca&s;e of Campbell of
Ottar, where a title of property to a land-e&s;tate,
kept alive by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive minorities, was found
good again&s;t the po&s;itive pre&s;cription; though
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion had been continued more than four|&s;core
years, upon an unexceptionable title of pro|perty.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to both ca&s;es, the la&s;t e&s;pecially,
it puzzles me to conceive what occa&s;ion there could
be for bringing minority into the que&s;tion. The
claimant had no occa&s;ion for minority: he had a
<PB N="270" REF="283">
more &s;imple propo&s;ition to maintain, viz. That a
right of property falls not by the negative pre|&s;cription;
and con&s;equently requires not the &s;up|port
of minority, nor of any other interruption.
And it is ob&s;erved above, that if the po&s;itive pre|&s;cription
could not take place without the nega|tive,
it could never take place.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to interruptions in general, the
act 1617 declares in effect, that no interruptions
&s;hall avail again&s;t the po&s;itive pre&s;cription, but
what di&s;turb peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land;
and it is of great importance to the public, that
the law &s;hould &s;tand &s;o. We have &s;een how
precarious land-rights were originally. The po|&s;itive
pre&s;cription was introduced, when the art
of hu&s;bandry was in its infancy: and but for that
pre&s;cription, it never could have arrived to any
maturity; becau&s;e no man who is not &s;ecure in
his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, will be&s;tow &s;kill or labour in ferti|li&s;ing
his land. But if a claim to land without
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion could be kept alive by minority, by a
<HI>non valentia agendi,</HI> or by other particulars that
interrupt the negative pre&s;cription, a land-holder,
even after a forty-years po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, would have
little encouragement to lay out his money upon
building, inclo&s;ing, planting, or other co&s;tly
improvements: the ground would yield &s;canty
crops, and the public would &s;uffer. The &s;alutary
effects of negative pre&s;cription are far from being
&s;o exten&s;ive: it concerns only two individuals,
<PB N="271" REF="284">
an obligee and an obligor; and it is of little con|cern
to the public, whether the obligor be pro|tected
from performance by negative pre&s;cription,
or whether the obligee make his claim effectual
by proving interruptions. It is a matter of pri|vate
right; and ju&s;tice rules, that the creditor
&s;hould not &s;uffer, &s;eeing he is not blameable for
his delay.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate the doctrine above laid down, that
po&s;itive pre&s;cription is entirely independent of ne|gative
pre&s;cription, I lay hold of a point, more
than once determined in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion;
which is, Whether a deed of ential can be cut
down by pre&s;cription? In order to talk intelli|gibly,
I &s;tate a &s;imple ca&s;e. A land-e&s;tate &s;tands
entailed upon heirs-male, with clau&s;es irritant
and re&s;olutive; and the entail is completed accor|ding
to the directions of the act 1685. The
elde&s;t &s;on of the entailer, neglecting the entail,
makes up his title to the e&s;tate as heir of line;
by which the e&s;tate becomes a fee-&s;imple in him;
and he and his male de&s;cendents continue in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion upon that title more than forty years.
The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion at length opens to a female,
the only child of the la&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and &s;he, as
heir of line, makes up her title to the e&s;tate.
By her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, an intere&s;t ari&s;es to a collateral
heir-male, who claims as heir of entail. This
claim is not cut down by negative pre&s;cription;
for an evident rea&s;on, that till the heir-female ap|peared,
<PB N="272" REF="285">
the claimant had no intere&s;t upon which
to found an action; and therefore could not be
guilty of negligence in forbearing. Nay, a ca&s;e
can be put where he would have a better chance
for the e&s;tate as heir of line, than as heir of en|tail;
which is, that he had a number of daugh|ters
without a &s;on, while the heir in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
had neither &s;on nor daughter for many years that
he lived with his fir&s;t wife; and came only at the
clo&s;e of life to have a &s;on by a &s;econd wife. But
&s;till further, his claim as heir of entail again&s;t
an heir-female in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is a claim to the pro|perty
of the e&s;tate; and it is laid down above,
that negative pre&s;cription cannot be objected to
&s;uch a claim. But it is clear from the act 1617,
that the claim of the heir of entail is cut down
by po&s;itive pre&s;cription. The female heir who,
by completing her title as heir of line, has be|come
proprietor of the e&s;tate, pleads, in the very
words of the &s;tatute, that &s;he and her predece&s;|&s;ors
having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed forty years on a title of pro|perty,
&startq;&s;he is &s;ecure again&s;t every other per&s;on
pretending right to the e&s;tate, upon any
ground, rea&s;on, or argument, except upon
fal&s;ehood.&endq; The deed of entail may have
been forged: it may have been altered or di&s;|charged.
In a word, every po&s;&s;ible &s;uppo&s;ition is
admitted as true, that tends to &s;upport the right
of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. And ju&s;tly; for if
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or be protected by po&s;itive pre&s;cription
<PB N="273" REF="286">
again&s;t a &s;tranger, who&s;e title to the e&s;tate mu&s;t
have been &s;u&s;tained had it been produced with|in
the forty years; much more ought &s;he to be
protected again&s;t the heir of an antiquated entail.
To cut down the &s;tranger may in reality be a for|feiture
of his right to the e&s;tate; to cut down the
heir of entail, is no greater &s;tretch than to deprive
him of a hope of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which may often be
both di&s;tant and uncertain. Such a trifling intere&s;t
ought not to weigh again&s;t the intere&s;t of every
landholder; and &s;till le&s;s again&s;t the intere&s;t of
the &s;ociety in general, as improvements can ne|ver
go on in a country where the property of
land remains in any degree uncertain. And ac|cordingly
where an e&s;tate has been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for
forty years as a fee-&s;imple, the po&s;itive pre&s;crip|tion
has been &s;u&s;tained again&s;t the heir of entail,
in every ca&s;e brought before the court; particu|larly
with re&s;pect to the e&s;tate of Achluncart,
31&s;t December 1693; with re&s;pect to the e&s;tate
of Macker&s;ton, 10th July 1739; with re&s;pect to
the e&s;tate of Kirkne&s;s, 3d February 1753; and
lately, 17th December 1776, in the important
cau&s;e between Douglas of Douglas and the Duke
of Hamilton.</P>
<P>We proceed to the &s;econd head of the act
1617, extending negative pre&s;cription to heri|table
bonds, and to other heritable &s;ecurities.
Forty years po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion on a title of property, is
exclu&s;ive of every other title of property; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="274" REF="287">
the &s;ame &s;ubject cannot belong to two per|&s;ons
at the &s;ame time: but as a right of proper|ty
is con&s;i&s;tent with a real &s;ecurity for debt, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<HI>qua</HI> proprietor is not exclu&s;ive of a real
&s;ecurity. What protection then have land-pro|prietors
again&s;t a real &s;ecurity that has lain dor|mant
above forty years? I an&s;wer, that by the
law of nature, and by common law, a man who
has acquired a conviction of freedom is protect|ed
from antiquated claims. The act 1469 was
made to enforce the law of nature, and common
law, with re&s;pect to per&s;onal obligations; and the
&s;econd head of the &s;tatute 1617 was made to en|force
them with re&s;pect to real obligations. The
words are, &startq;And &s;icklike, his Maje&s;ty &s;tatutes
and ordains, That all actions competent of the
law upon heritable bonds, rever&s;ions, con|tracts,
or others what&s;omever, &s;hall be pur|&s;ued
within the &s;pace of forty years after the
date of the &s;ame.&endq; As here the negative
pre&s;cription is extended to real claims, and as
that pre&s;cription is founded on negligence, it fol|lows,
that every circum&s;tance which purges ne|gligence
mu&s;t be admitted here, as well as with
re&s;pect to per&s;onal obligations. The &s;tatute ac|cordingly
declares minority in this ca&s;e to be an
interruption; and from parity of rea&s;on, <HI>non
valens agere</HI> mu&s;t al&s;o be an interruption. Here,
by the by, a very &s;trong argument can be drawn
from the &s;tatute it&s;elf, that minority does not
<PB N="275" REF="288">
interrupt the po&s;itive pre&s;cription. When an ex|pre&s;s
exception of minority from the negative
pre&s;cription of real &s;ecurities, was thought nece&s;|&s;ary;
can any man believe, that it was left to
be implied as an exception from po&s;itive pre&s;crip|tion?
It is not naturally an exception; and had
the legi&s;lature intended to make it an exception,
there was much more rea&s;on for &s;peaking out,
than in the ca&s;e of negative pre&s;cription.</P>
<P>The &s;tatutes of this i&s;land are not illu&s;trious
for profound knowledge. The exceptions are
few, and the pre&s;ent act 1617 is one of the mo&s;t
illu&s;trious. It is &s;trictly agreeably to the com|mon
law, and to the law of nature, not only in
the principal parts above di&s;played, but in every
minute particular. Take for example a right of
rever&s;ion, which is mentioned above in the cla&s;s
of <HI>res merae facultatis,</HI> where a man provides
to him&s;elf a power to exerci&s;e the faculty or not,
as he finds it convenient; and where therefore
delay is no evidence of dereliction, nor even of
negligence. Conformable to this definition, the
&s;tatute provides, That an action upon a right of
rever&s;ion &s;hall be perpetual; provided the rever|&s;ion
be ingro&s;&s;ed in the infeftment, or be record|ed,
which remove all &s;u&s;picion of forgery or fal&s;e|hood.
But a letter of rever&s;ion di&s;tinct from the
infeftment, and not recorded, falls by the nega|tive
pre&s;cription. Why? Not from dereliction
or negligence; but from &s;u&s;picion of fal&s;ehood,
<PB N="276" REF="289">
or other defect, the evidence of which is lo&s;t by
length of time. Advert to another particular.
The negative pre&s;cription of an action of war|randice,
is declared not to commence from the
date of the obligation of warrandice, but from
the time of di&s;tre&s;s. The rea&s;on is good: before
di&s;tre&s;s, no action of warrandice lies; and till
warrandice be competent, no length of time can
infer a &s;u&s;picion of negligence or of fal&s;ehood.
Why then is it enacted, that a pur&s;uit on an
heritable bond mu&s;t be commenced within forty
years of its date? This is explained above. An
heritable bond, a &s;pecies of wad&s;et originally,
was not an obligation for payment of money,
and con&s;equently could not have a term of pay|ment.
In its pre&s;ent form, it is an obligation
for payment of money, and has a term of pay|ment;
from which term pre&s;cription will com|mence
as in other obligations.</P>
<P>Thus, heritable bonds, and other heritable
&s;ecurities, pre&s;erved alive again&s;t negative pre|&s;cription,
mu&s;t, for the rea&s;on above given, pre|vail
al&s;o again&s;t po&s;itive pre&s;cription. But the&s;e
mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a proce&s;s of redemp|tion
founded on a letter of rever&s;ion. For
though the rever&s;ion be recorded, which &s;ecures
it again&s;t negative pre&s;cription, it is not however
effectual again&s;t po&s;itive pre&s;cription. It is a
claim to the property of the land, clogged only
with a condition of paying a certain &s;um; and as
<PB N="277" REF="290">
po&s;itive pre&s;cription makes a complete title to the
property, it excludes, of nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, a
claim of redemption, no le&s;s effectually than it
excludes every other claim of property.</P>

Martinmas appears to have been the
term of the entry and removing of tenants<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See article 17.</NOTE>.
But in the &s;ixteenth century, and perhaps more
early, Whit&s;unday had become the term of en|try
and of removing; whether from the difficul|ty
of tran&s;porting hou&s;ehold-furniture, and other
goods, through bad roads, in the dead of winter,
or from other cau&s;es, our authors give us no in|formation.
Craig, &s;etting forth the form of
warning before the &s;tatute under con&s;ideration
was made, mentions Whit&s;unday as the only
term of removing. &startq;Dominus ante fores colo|ni,
cui verbo denunciaret ut ad proximam Pen|teco&s;ten
migret, lancem ligneam, &s;ive di&s;cum
e&s;carium, in duas partes frangebat, eo &s;ymbo|lo
diremptum jus foederis et locationis &s;ignifi|cans
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. dieg. 9. &s;ect. 4.</NOTE>.&endq; And he adds, &startq;Secundo po&s;t Pen|teco&s;ten
die, ni&s;i colonus volens migrave|rit,
vi eum ex aedibus pellebat, pecora &s;ive
boves ex bovilibus ejiciens, &s;uas pecudes ad
<PB N="279" REF="292">
pa&s;cendum inducens.&endq; Lord Stair<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Book 2. tit. 9. &s;ect. 39.</NOTE> joins
his authority to that of Craig. &startq;The order of re|moving
of old (&s;ays he) was thus. The ma|&s;ter
of the ground did only verbally intimate to
the tenant to remove at the next Whit&s;unday;
and the only &s;olemnity requi&s;ite was, that be|fore
the &s;aid term he appeared before the door
of the tenant, and broke a lance there, as a
&s;ymbol of his braking the tacit relocation be|tween
them; whereupon, the &s;econd day af|ter
Whit&s;unday, he came <HI>brevi manu,</HI> and
expelled the tenant.&endq; At the &s;ame time, the
authority of the&s;e writers is little nece&s;&s;ary, when
we have the authority of the &s;tatute it&s;elf, men|tioning
Whit&s;unday as the only term of remo|ving.
It appoints, &startq;That the ma&s;ter of the
ground give a precept of warning in writ,
commanding his officer to go, forty days prece|ding
Whit&s;unday, and intimate to the tenant,
that he remove him&s;elf, his family, &s;ubtenants,
&amp;c. at the &s;aid term.&endq; This fact I wi&s;h to be
kept in view; for it will contribute greatly to
a ju&s;t analy&s;is of the &s;tatute under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>It appears not that the legi&s;lature intended to
alter the practice at that time e&s;tabli&s;hed, con|cerning
either the time of warning, or the term
of removing; but only to introduce regularity
and order in the form of removing; in&s;tead of
<PB N="280" REF="293">
a removing <HI>via facti,</HI> which, is tho&s;e rude times,
commonly produced riots, and braches of the peace.
Li&s;ten to Craig in the place above quoted. &startq;At
cum &s;aepe fieret, ut colonus, &s;uis amicis fretus,
migrare nollet, et vi domini vim opponeret,
factum e&s;t &s;aepe, ut qui viribus plus po&s;&s;et, is
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ione effet potior; tantumque de vi, et
violentis fructibus, domino, &s;i pellere colonum
non potui&s;&s;et, &s;upere&s;&s;et actio; inde cum gra|vi&s;&s;imae
&s;aepe contentiones procederent, &s;aepe
etiam ad manus perveniretur.&endq; In that view
it is enacted, that if the party warned, removed
not at the term, the warner &s;hall apply to a pro|per
court for a decree of removing; to which
&s;ucceeds a precept of ejection. And to &s;ecure
acce&s;s to a proper court, it is ordained, &startq;That
&s;hiriffs and other judges ordinair hold courts
all the lawful fifteen days immediately after
Trinity Sunday, for doing ju&s;tice in the &s;aid
cau&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>This was a remedy for the evil in view; but
it generated a greater evil of a different kind.
Every proce&s;s that has a per&s;onal conclu&s;ion, is
in effect a complaint again&s;t a party, for doing
what he ought not to have done, or for omitting
what he ought to have done. At the time of
this &s;tatute, accordingly, and for many years af|ter,
there could be no proce&s;s, till the party had
done what was wrong, or omitted to do what
was right. A proce&s;s, for example, could not
<PB N="281" REF="294">
be rai&s;ed again&s;t a debtor before the term of pay|ment;
becau&s;e till that term was elap&s;ed, it could
not be &s;ub&s;umed, that he had omitted what he
ought to have done. Nor could a proce&s;s of re|moving
be rai&s;ed again&s;t a tenant, till the term
of removing was pa&s;&s;ed. The &s;tatute accordingly
does not direct a court of removing to be held
before Whit&s;unday, the term of removing; but
as &s;oon after as po&s;&s;ible, viz. immediately after
Trinity Sunday, which is the fir&s;t Sunday after
Whit&s;unday. It is amazing, that, even in an
age of darkne&s;s, the in&s;ufficiency of this re|gulation
was not fore&s;een. A landlord, after
warning his tenant to remove at Whit&s;unday, en|gages
another to enter at that term. He cannot
eject the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as formerly, to make way for
his new tenant. He mu&s;t apply to a judge, and
cannot bring his complaint till the term of remo|ving
be pa&s;t. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his pro|curator,
invents many defences, &s;ufficient to pro|long
the proce&s;s perhaps for a year. The new
tenant is left without re&s;ource, not a hou&s;e to
protect him from the cold, nor a mouthful of
gra&s;s to pre&s;erve his cattle from famine. The
condition of landlords was deplorable. They
could not with &s;afety engage a new tenant, till
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or was actually ejected; and the land
mu&s;t have lain wa&s;te the re&s;t of that year.</P>
<P>Violent di&s;ea&s;es operate frequently their own
cure. Nece&s;&s;ity introduced a &s;alutary deviation
<PB N="282" REF="295">
from common law; which is, to &s;u&s;tain a proce&s;s
of removing before the term of removing. The
commi&s;&s;ioners for admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice ap|pointed
by Oliver Cromwell, appear to be the
fir&s;t who thought of a remedy for this di&s;ea&s;e.
In the record of their proceedings, is found the
following regulation: &startq;That &s;ummons of remo|ving
before the &s;upreme judges, may be rai&s;ed
at any time after the warning, to be execute
on twenty-one days; providing the day of com|pearance
be &s;ix days after the term.&endq; Lord
Stair &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome &s;uch mea&s;ure.
&startq;Legal execution,&endq; &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, &startq;is not
competent ordinarily till delay, becau&s;e none
&s;hould be pur&s;ued till he have failed; yet in
&s;ome ca&s;es the debtor may be pur&s;ued before
the term, to pay at the term, as <HI>&s;i vergat ad
inopiam.</HI> Yea, in removing, it &s;eems very
expedient to pur&s;ue the party warned, even
before the term, to remove at the term; o|therwi&s;e
the lands cannot be &s;afely &s;$t, the
tenant not knowing if others will remove wil|lingly:
and there ought to be no uncertain|ty
in that point, which is a public intere&s;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Book 1. tit. 17. &s;ect. 15.</NOTE>&endq;
Reformers in religion differ widely from tho&s;e in
law. The former, enthu&s;ia&s;tically zealous, over|turn
every e&s;tabli&s;hed form, and &s;top not till not
a ve&s;tige be left of the national creed, or the na|tional
<PB N="283" REF="296">
ceremonies. The latter, cool and cautious,
proceed with circum&s;pection: being afraid of con|&s;equences,
they &s;eldom reach perfection; nor do
they always venture &s;o far as even their judge|ment
would lead them. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the
commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;en&s;ible of the imperfection of
common law, ventured to allow a &s;ummons of
removing to be rai&s;ed before the term of remo|ving;
and yet they adhered &s;o far to the old law,
as to appoint the day of compearance to be &s;ix
days after that term: which was but half a re|medy,
or rather no remedy at all; for a proce&s;s
commenced before the term of removing may be
protracted for months; and what is the new te|nant
to do in the mean time? Lord Stair, &s;en|&s;ible
of the in&s;ufficiency of this improvement,
gives his opinion, that the proce&s;s of removing
may be carried on and concluded before the
term, decreeing the tenant to remove at the
term, ready for execution if the tenant &s;hould
prove refractory. And &s;uch proce&s;&s;es are now
frequent and familiar.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide requiring a proce&s;s of removing in or|der
to prevent private violence, which was the
chief purpo&s;e of the &s;tatute; another alteration
was introduced, which is, to require the warn|ing,
and &s;ervice thereof, to be in writing. In all
other re&s;pects, the u&s;ual from was pre&s;erved.
Whit&s;unday was the u&s;ual term of removing;
and warning accordingly is appointed to be
<PB N="284" REF="297">
forty days before that term. With re&s;pect to
any other term of removing, the act is &s;ilent: it
is not provided for in the act, but left to com|mon
law. There is nothing &s;aid in the act, nor
in&s;inuated, that the warning mu&s;t be forty days
before Whit&s;unday, whatever be the term of re|moving.
And if &s;o, may it not fairly be inferred
from the act it&s;elf, that if forty days be &s;ufficient
where Whit&s;unday is the term of removing, the
&s;ame number is &s;ufficient whatever be the term?
There can be no rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, for privileging
a tenant who removes at Martinmas, with a
more early warning, than when the removing is
at Whit&s;unday. But we are not left entirely to
an argument from analogy. Balfour, in his
chapter intitled, <HI>Anent removing,</HI> reports a ca&s;e,
Lord Borthwick <HI>contra</HI> Sym, 19th May 1565,
in the following words. &startq;In actions of remo|ving
of tenants, the warning is not &s;ufficient
except there be forty days free between the
warning and the term of Whit&s;unday or Mar|tinmas,
excluding not only the day of warn|ing,
but al&s;o the day of Whit&s;unday or Mar|tinmas.&endq;
In this ca&s;e, but ten years after the
&s;tatute, we have the greate&s;t lawyer of his time
laying it down as a rule, That the warning mu&s;t
be forty days before the term of removing, whe|ther
Whit&s;unday or Martinmas; and he is far
from under&s;tanding the act as appointing the
warning to precede Whit&s;unday whatever be
<PB N="285" REF="298">
the term of removing. That learned author
could not mi&s;take the meaning of a &s;tatute, which
probably was framed by him&s;elf, undoubtedly
with his concurrence.</P>
<P>Sir George Mackenzie, however, in his ob&s;er|vations
on this &s;tatute, lays it down, &startq;That
warning mu&s;t be made before Whit&s;unday,
though the per&s;on warned be not obliged to
remove by his tack till the Martinmas.&endq; And
this erroneous opinion has been blindly follow|ed,
not only by later writers, but even by the
court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, which is much more to be re|greted.</P>
<P>I term this an erroneous opinion, becau&s;e it
is clear beyond a cavil, that the time of warn|ing
is not regulated by the &s;tatute, except where
the removing is at Whit&s;unday. And Sir George
had no authority, either from the &s;tatute or from
analogy, to &s;ay, that warning mu&s;t be made be|fore
Whit&s;unday, even where Martinmas is the
term of removing. The &s;tatute begins with re|quiring
warning to be made forty days before
the fea&s;t of Whit&s;unday. The precept of warn|ing
mu&s;t be read at the pari&s;h-church, and a
copy mu&s;t be affixed on the mo&s;t patent door,
forty days before the term, i. e. the term of
Whit&s;unday, the only term mentioned in the
act. Then comes the following clau&s;e: &startq;And
if the party warned in manner fore&s;aid remove
not at the term, (i. e the &s;aid term), in that
<PB N="286" REF="299">
ca&s;e the warner &s;hall apply to the judge,&endq;
&amp;c. Every article here points at Whit&s;unday as
the term of removing. But what makes it cer|tain,
that Whit&s;unday was here under&s;tood to be
the term of removing, is the clau&s;e appoiting
judges to hold courts for proce&s;&s;es of removing
immediately after Trinity Sunday, being the fir&s;t
Sunday after Whit&s;unday. At the time of the
&s;tatute, as mentioned above, a proce&s;s of remo|ving
was not competent before the term of re|moving.
And to appoint courts for proce&s;s of
removing to be held immediately after Whit&s;un|day,
nece&s;&s;arily implies, that Whit&s;unday was the
term of removing.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent practice, in &s;everal ca&s;es that may
be figured, will be found incon&s;i&s;tent with an
expre&s;s clau&s;e in the &s;tatute, &startq;requiring that the
warning be given within a year of the term
of removing.&endq; Such a ca&s;e was lately brought
before the court. The term of entry and of re|moving
was Beltan, which is the fir&s;t day of May.
Here is an evident dilemma. Warning, it is
&s;aid, mu&s;t here be given before the preceding
Whit&s;unday; and yet, if &s;o given, it is null by
the clau&s;e now mentioned, being more than a
year before the term of removing. A warning
farther back than a year, may render the tenant
negligent about another farm, hoping a change
of mind in his landlord. Thus, according to the
meaning of the act adopted in practice, one part
<PB N="287" REF="300">
of it is made to contradict another. Does not
this &s;hew, that the adopted meaning is erro|neous?
If the warning mu&s;t always be given
within a year of the term of removing, does it
not nece&s;&s;arily follow, that warning mu&s;t not al|ways
precede Whit&s;unday? And if it mu&s;t vary
in &s;ome ca&s;es, what rea&s;on can be given why it
ought not always to be forty days before the
term of removing?</P>
<P>The opinion of Sir George Mackenzie, upon
which our pre&s;ent practice is founded, de&s;erves
little regard, con&s;idering, that he quotes for his
authority three deci&s;ions of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion,
two of them not to the purpo&s;e, and the third a
very lame authority. The fir&s;t is in Durie<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">8th July 1626, Foulis.</NOTE>.
A tack being to expire in September, the land|lord
executed a warning before Whit&s;unday;
and &s;ub&s;equent to that term, rai&s;ed a proce&s;s of
removing, concluding, that the tenant &s;hould re|move
at the expiry of his tack in the September
following. The defence was, That neither the
warning, nor action of removing, could be &s;u&s;|tained
while the tack was current. The court
&s;u&s;tained the warning; but found, that the ac|tion
of removing could not proceed before ex|piration
of the tack. Here we find the old law
in vigour, That a proce&s;s of removing cannot
proceed till the term of removing be pa&s;t: which
<PB N="288" REF="301">
is all that is material in the judgement; for as
to the warniug, it was childi&s;h to make the ob|jection,
when the very purpo&s;e of a warning is
to notify to the tenant, that he mu&s;t remove at
the term. But what I am only concerned to ob|&s;erve
here is, that the court did not find, that
the warning mu&s;t be before Whit&s;unday, where
removing is in September or at Martinmas: they
did not even in&s;inuate, that &s;uch was their opi|nion.
The &s;econd deci&s;ion, reported al&s;o by
Durie<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">16th December 1628, Engli&s;h <HI>contra</HI> Tenants.</NOTE>, is not more to the purpo&s;e than the
fir&s;t. Nothing is determined, but that a warn|ing
before the term of removing is proper; which
no mortal ever doubted of. The third deci&s;ion,
quoted by Sir George, is al&s;o from Durie<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">15th June 1631, Ram&s;ay <HI>contra</HI> Weir.</NOTE>.
The &s;ubject was a kail-yard, the entry to which
is commonly at Candlemas, the time for digging
and manuring. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or being warned for|ty
days before Candlemas to remove at that term,
it was objected, That the act 1555 requires the
warning to precede Whit&s;unday. The court re|fu&s;ed
to &s;u&s;tain the warning, &startq;&s;eeing it was not
made before the ordinary term of Whit&s;unday,
to remove at Whit&s;unday, as u&s;e is in other
warnings and removings.&endq; There is here un|doubtedly
an error, either in the report, or in
<PB N="289" REF="302">
the printing; for the court was incapable to give
an opinion that did not touch the point in di&s;|pute.
But &s;uppo&s;ing that opinion to have been
given, the meaning of the court mu&s;t have been,
that Whit&s;unday removings only are regulated by
the act 1555, and that removings at other terms
are to be regulated by practice. Be&s;ide that a
kail-yard &s;eems not to be comprehended under
the act. It is this very opinion however that
moved Lord Stair to lay down, that all warnings
mu&s;t precede Whit&s;unday. His words are,
&startq;This order mu&s;t be u&s;ed, though the term
of the tack be not at Whit&s;unday, but at Mar|tinmas
or Candlemas; and it will not &s;uffice
to be made forty days before the&s;e terms;
15th June 1631, Ram&s;ay <HI>contra</HI> Weir<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. tit. 9. &s;ect. 40.</NOTE>.&endq;
He adds the following very in&s;ufficient rea&s;on.
&startq;The warning before Whit&s;unday is appointed,
that tenants may timeou&s;ly provide for them|&s;elves;
which cannot be but before Whit&s;un|day,
the ordinary time lands u&s;e to be &s;et.&endq;
<HI>Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus.</HI> A warn|ing
before Whit&s;unday avails nothing to a tenant
who cannot remove till Martinmas, whatever
number of farms be open at Whit&s;unday. Mar|tinmas,
at the &s;ame time, is a term of removing
frequent in Scotland; and when a tenant re|moves
at that term, he may have a farm as rea|dily
<PB N="290" REF="303">
as when he removes at Whit&s;unday. It is
unlucky that this obvious reflection did not oc|cur
to his Lord&s;hip; for his authority, influen|cing
the court, has embarra&s;&s;ed removings, and
e&s;tabli&s;hed a practice inconvenient both to land|lord
and tenant. The landlord mu&s;t warn be|tween
&s;even or eight months before Martinmas,
where that is the term of removing. Many
things may occur to make him change his mind;
and forty days before Martinmas, he notifies to the
tenant, that he may continue where he is. But,
unluckily for both, the tenant has engaged him|&s;elf
to another landlord. The inconvenience to
the tenant is &s;till greater. A warning very long
before the term is no indication of what the
landlord's mind will be when the term of remo|ving
approaches; and hoping a change of mind,
he forbears to &s;eek for another farm. Much ex|perience
has taught us, that forty days is a pro|per
&s;pace: the tenant has &s;ufficient lei&s;ure to in|quire
for another po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and there is no pro|&s;pect,
that in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace the landlord will
change his mind. A warning ten or eleven
months before the term, in&s;tead of directing the
tenant's conduct, puzzles him with uncertainty.
Fond of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he would gladly hope fa|vour
from his landlord: he is irre&s;olute; and
finds too late, that he mu&s;t remove without ha|ving
&s;ecured another farm.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Analy&s;is of act 16. parl. 1617, appointing
regi&s;tration of &s;ei&s;ins, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE act has the following preamble: &startq;Con|&s;idering
the fraudulent dealing of par|ties,
who, by their unju&s;t concealing of &s;ome
private right made by them, render the &s;ub|&s;equent
alienation done for great &s;ums of mo|ney
altogether unprofitable.&endq; To remedy
&s;uch fraud, a public regi&s;ter is appointed, in
which all rever&s;ions, &amp;c. and all in&s;truments of
&s;ei&s;in &s;hall be recorded within three&s;core days of
the date; under certification, that the &s;aid writs,
not being recorded within the &s;aid &s;pace, &startq;&s;hall
make no faith in judgement, by way of action
or exception, in prejudice of a third party who
hath acquired a perfect and complete right to
the land.&endq; But it is declared, &startq;That the
&s;aid writs &s;hall be effectual again&s;t the granter,
his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.&endq;</P>
<P>To analy&s;e this act, we begin with examining
what are the deeds that are &s;ecured by it; and next,
again&s;t what hazards &s;uch deeds are protected.
With regard to the former, the legi&s;lature evidently
had nothing in view, but to &s;ecure <HI>bona fide</HI> pur|cha&s;ers
for a valuable con&s;ideration. The &s;tatute
<PB N="292" REF="305">
is in favour of purcha&s;ers, not creditors: an ap|pri&s;ing,
an adjudication, an infeftment of annual|rent,
are all of them left to common law. With
re&s;pect to the other head, the &s;ecurity granted is
again&s;t latent voluntary rights only. So &s;ays the
&s;tatute; and all the deeds &s;pecified required to
be recorded, are voluntary deeds, rever&s;ions,
regre&s;&s;es, bonds of rever&s;ion, a&s;&s;ignations there|to,
di&s;charges of the &s;ame, renunciations of wad|&s;ets,
&amp;c. The&s;e deeds admit not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or
infeftment, and are by their nature real, and
con&s;equently effectual again&s;t &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.
It was therefore a mo&s;t &s;alutary regulation, to
appoint the&s;e to be recorded. The act &s;tops
there; and makes no provi&s;ion again&s;t any la|tent
right but what is voluntary; and again&s;t
&s;uch latent right, if &s;uch can be figured, a pur|cha&s;er
is not &s;ecure, if the right be in its nature
real.</P>
<P>The &s;tatute has afforded an additional &s;ecurity
to purcha&s;ers, by appointing all in&s;truments of
&s;ei&s;in to be recorded. It might &s;eem at fir&s;t view,
that the regulation &s;hould only comprehend &s;ei&s;ins
that proceed upon voluntary deeds; as &s;uch deeds
are the only deeds that are appointed to be re|corded.
But the enactment is general; and
ju&s;tly &s;o: with re&s;pect to a &s;ei&s;in on an adjudica|tion,
to mention no other, there is the utmo&s;t ex|pediency
that it &s;hould be recorded; for otherwi&s;e
no purcha&s;er would be &s;ecure.</P>

would be non&s;en&s;e to &s;ay, that the &s;ei&s;in of an
heir, unle&s;s recorded within three&s;core days,
&s;hall make no faith in judgement again&s;t a third
party who hath acquired a complete right to the
land. An heir, whether his title be recorded or
not, cannot enter the li&s;ts again&s;t any per&s;on de|riving
right from the ance&s;tor. Neither do the
other clau&s;es reach this ca&s;e. The words of the
preamble, &startq;the unju&s;t concealing of &s;ome pri|vate
right made by them,&endq; do not compre|hend
the heir; and as little the concluding words,
&startq;that the &s;aid writs &s;hall be effectual again&s;t the
granter, his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.&endq;</P>
<P>On the other hand, the words are preci&s;e and
peremptory, That all in&s;truments of &s;ei&s;in &s;hall be
recorded. And if, for &s;ecuring purcha&s;ers, it
appear, that no &s;ei&s;in requires more to be record|ed
than that of an heir, there can remain no
doubt of the will of the legi&s;lature as expre&s;&s;ed in
the words. This will appear from a common
and familiar example. An heir &s;erves to his pre|dece&s;&s;or,
is infeft, but thinks not of putting his
&s;ei&s;in upon record. After his death, the next
heir, perhaps a di&s;tant collateral, believing the
former heir to have died in apparency, &s;erves to
the remoter predece&s;&s;or as the la&s;t infeft; and af|ter

po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome years, &s;ells the land for a full
price. After his death, a third heir, di&s;covering
that the fir&s;t heir, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have died
in apparency, had been infeft, makes up his title
as heir to him; and within the years of pre&s;crip|tion
brings a proce&s;s again&s;t the purcha&s;er, con|cluding,
that his author's &s;ervice to a wrong pre|dece&s;&s;or
was erroneous; and therefore that he
the purcha&s;er has no right to the land. Suppo|&s;ing
the infeftment of an heir to be good in law
without recording, the pur&s;uer mu&s;t prevail;
which would render every purcha&s;e from an heir
not a little perilous. But what puts this matter
beyond doubt, is cotemporary evidence of the
meaning of the legi&s;lature. The regi&s;ter appoint|ed
by the act begins 19th Augu&s;t 1617; and the
very next day a &s;ei&s;in is recorded, proceeding on
a precept of <HI>Clare con&s;tat</HI> by Ludovick Duke of
Lennox to John Lord Lind&s;ay; and other &s;ei&s;ins
of the &s;ame kind are from time to time recorded
in great plenty. Had the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion ordered
a &s;earch in the record, they would not have found,
as they once did, that the &s;ei&s;in of an heir without
being recorded, is good again&s;t a &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;|&s;or<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dalrymple, 17th December 1703, Keith <HI>contra</HI> Sinclair.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The act 1695, concerning the three years po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of an heir-apparent, gives indeed &s;ome re|lief
to a purcha&s;er for a valuable con&s;ideration.
<PB N="295" REF="310">
But be&s;ide the hazard of the heir's death who
&s;ells within the three years, many deeds highly
favoured in law are left un&s;upported by that act;
a bond of provi&s;ion, for example, a &s;ettlement of
an e&s;tate, and other deeds highly rational.</P>
<P>But now admitting, that the &s;ei&s;in of an heir
ought to be recorded, what certification is provi|ded
again&s;t an heir who neglects to record his &s;ei|&s;in?
and what is to be the con&s;equence? It is
but too evident, that the certification in the fta|tute
is not applicable to an heir; and that with
impunity he may tran&s;gre&s;s the &s;tatute, if no o|ther
compul&s;ion be provided. To &s;ay what &s;hall
be the effect of a &s;tatutory injunction, ordering or
prohibiting a thing to be done, without adding
any penalty, would require much di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.
What at pre&s;ent is only incumbent upon me, is to
examine what is to be the con&s;equence of an
heir's neglect in this ca&s;e, where no certification
is added. The recording is made nece&s;&s;ary by the
act; and the recording mu&s;t be held an e&s;&s;ential
&s;olemnity, like de&s;igning the writer and witne&s;&s;es
in a bond, made nece&s;&s;ary by act 1681. The
neglect is a nullity; and the &s;ei&s;in, by that ne|glect,
is no better than if the &s;olemnity of deli|vering
earth and &s;tone were omitted. A purcha|&s;er
ought to &s;ee the &s;ei&s;in on record, without
which he can have no reliance on it.</P>
<P>In the foregoing analy&s;is, I have adhered &s;trict|ly
to the words of the act. I now proceed to
<PB N="296" REF="311">
view the act in the light of equity and expediency,
in order to fulfil the purpo&s;e of the legi&s;lature,
without regarding the defect of words. It was
undoubtedly the purpo&s;e of the legi&s;lature, to &s;a|cilitate
the commerce of land, by &s;ecuring <HI>bona
fide</HI> purcha&s;ers, for a valuable con&s;ideration, a|gain&s;t
&s;uch latent rights as are real, and con&s;e|quently
are effectual again&s;t purcha&s;ers; and the
means employed, are the requiring &s;uch rights
to be recorded, in order to put purcha&s;ers on their
guard. The only rights mentioned are rever&s;ions,
and other voluntary rights; becau&s;e probably &s;uch
only occurred to the legi&s;lature. But as no cau&s;e
can be a&s;&s;igned, why a purcha&s;er &s;hould not be
&s;ecure again&s;t other latent rights as well as again&s;t
what are voluntary, it de&s;erves con&s;ideration,
whether it be not the duty of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion,
to complete the purpo&s;e of the legi&s;lature, by &s;e|curing
purcha&s;ers again&s;t every latent right, vo|luntary
or not. A rever&s;ion is, by act 27. parl.
1469, made effectual again&s;t &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.
And if a rever&s;ion mu&s;t be recorded under certifi|cation
of lo&s;ing its privilege, no other right what|ever
ought to be exempted.</P>
<P>That the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion will proceed to com|plete
the &s;ecurity intended for purcha&s;ers, may
be hoped, but cannot with certainty be foretold.
But which-ever of the &s;y&s;tems be adopted, that
of &s;trict law, or that of expediency, the common
law continues in force as to every particular, pur|cha&s;ers
<PB N="297" REF="312">
only excepted. A &s;ei&s;in, for example,
upon a precept of <HI>Clare con&s;tat,</HI> requires not
recording as a &s;olemnity, except as to purcha&s;ers:
in all que&s;tions among heirs or gratuitous di&s;po|nees,
it continues to be a title of property, though
it be not recorded; preci&s;ely as a rever&s;ion not re|corded
continues to be effectual again&s;t heirs and
gratuitous di&s;ponees. All that the &s;tatute requires,
is only that it mu&s;t be recorded, to &s;ecure it a|gain&s;t
a purcha&s;er for a valuable con&s;ideration.</P>

<HEAD>ART. XXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Analy&s;is of act 32. parl. 1661, concerning
heritable and moveable bonds.</HEAD>
<P>A Bond containing a clau&s;e for payment of in|tere&s;t,
was of old held to be an heritable
&s;ubject. The heir of the creditor made up his
title to it by a general &s;ervice; and the heir of
the debtor, not the executor, was ultimately
liable. Such bonds were rendered moveable by
act 57. parl. 1641; and that act having been re|&s;cinded
by a general clau&s;e along with the o|ther
acts of that period, &s;uch bonds were again
rendered moveable by the act under con&s;idera|tion.</P>
<P>The meaning of the act is in practice held to be,
That a bond bearing intere&s;t is rendered move|able
in every re&s;pect, &s;o as to belong to the next
in kin of the creditor, and to burden ultimately
the next in kin of the debtor. This is laid down
by Lord Stair in the following words. &startq;There
is another con&s;iderable difference betwixt the
condition of the wife and children, introduced
by the act of parliament 1641, revived parl.
1661, cap. 32. whereby bonds and provi&s;ions
bearing clau&s;es of annualrent, which before
<PB N="299" REF="314">
were heritable, are now moveable as to the
bairns, neare&s;t of kin, executors, and lega|tars;
and are at the defunct's di&s;po&s;al by te&s;ta|ment,
or any deed on deathbed. And they
are exhau&s;tible by debts of the &s;ame nature,
which debts do not exhau&s;t the relict's part<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Tit. <HI>Executry,</HI> &s;ect. 47.</NOTE>.&endq;
And the rule here laid down is con&s;tantly follow|ed
in practice.</P>
<P>I find not that this con&s;truction of the act has
any &s;upport, either from its words or its intend|ment.
There is not the lea&s;t appearance of any
intention but to revive the act 1641. It was in|deed
not revived in expre&s;s terms, becau&s;e it
was thought improper to honour &s;o far any &s;ta|tute
of that period: but it was revived in effect;
not only by renewing what was there enacted,
but by a retro&s;pect in order to validate every
thing that had been done under its authority.
And &s;o fully was its preamble in view, that it
was not thought nece&s;&s;ary to give any pre|amble
to the reviving act. Therefore the be&s;t
comment on the &s;tatute under con&s;ideration,
will be the re&s;cinded &s;tatute, which gave
birth to it. That &s;tatute expre&s;&s;es clearly the
purpo&s;e of the legi&s;lature. It begins with ob|&s;erving,
that younger children are but &s;can|tily
<PB N="300" REF="315">
provided by law; that creditors, in &s;tipula|ting
intere&s;t for their money, have no intention
to di&s;appoint their younger children; that the
heir profits by their ignorance; &startq;and that a
number of orphans, and fatherle&s;s children,
di&s;appointed of their natural portion, are
brought to poverty and mi&s;ery, and forced to
become beggars; which is often found by pi|tiful
experience.&endq; Here the words are ex|pre&s;s,
that the &s;tatute was made to increa&s;e the
fund for younger children. And the enacting
clau&s;e corre&s;ponds accurately to the intention of
the legi&s;lature, &s;tatuting and ordaining, &startq;That
all contracts or bonds for &s;ums of money, with
condition of payment of annualrent or profit,
&s;hall pertain to the bairns and neare&s;t of kin
of the defunct; and that the &s;aid &s;ums &s;hall
be confirmed by the executor, without pay|ment
of any quot for the &s;ame.&endq; The words
of the reviving act, though not altogether &s;o ex|plicit,
are to the &s;ame purpo&s;e: &startq;That all con|tracts
and obligations for &s;ums of money, con|taining
clau&s;es for payment of annualrent or
profit, made &s;ince the 16th November 1641,
or to be made in time coming, &s;hall be holden
to be moveable, to be confirmed by the exe|tor,
and to appertain to the neare$t of kin and
legatars, according to the law and practique of
moveables.&endq; Let it be remarked, that the&s;e
<PB N="301" REF="316">
words are applicable to the next in kin of the
creditor only.</P>
<P>So far the matter is clear; and if a bond bear|ing
intere&s;t be rendered moveable <HI>quoad debito|rem,</HI>
it is &s;urely not by appointment of the &s;ta|tute,
but by &s;ome inference from it; and we
&s;hall &s;ee anon whether there be any ground for
drawing &s;uch an inference.</P>
<P>What then has led Lord Stair, and all our
lawyers after him, to think, that the act under
con&s;ideration has rendered bonds bearing intere&s;t
moveable both as to creditor and debtor? This
opinion has nothing to re&s;t on, but a principle of
common law unwarily applied to this ca&s;e, That
as far as an heir repre&s;ents <HI>activ&egrave;,</HI> as far he mu&s;t
al&s;o repre&s;ent <HI>pa&s;&s;iv&egrave;;</HI> and that to whatever
&s;pecies of debts he &s;ucceeds by a general &s;ervice,
he mu&s;t be liable to debts of the &s;ame kind.
Were I reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of pleading nice
or doubtful points, I might with a good grace
deny, that a principle regarding the repre&s;enta|tion
of an heir, is applicable to an executor,
who is a tru&s;tee or factor, and in no &s;en&s;e a re|pre&s;entative.
But the point here is neither nice
nor doubtful. It certainly will not be contend|ed,
that the foregoing principle mu&s;t be applied
to an executor or next in kin, in &s;pite of the &s;ta|tute.
And the fir&s;t reflection will make it clear,
that to &s;ubject the next in kin of the debtor in
this ca&s;e, goes not only beyond the words of
<PB N="302" REF="317">
the &s;tatute, but is fundamentally &s;ubver&s;ive of
its purpo&s;e and intendment. The declared pur|po&s;e
of the &s;tatute, is to benefit younger chil|dren,
by augmenting the fund of their legal pro|vi&s;ion;
which is done by adding to that fund
bonds bearing intere&s;t, formerly heritable. But
it would be a matter of chance, whether young|er
children would be benefited, were they at the
&s;ame time made liable to pay &s;uch bonds. A man
may leave bonds bearing intere&s;t, and be due
double the &s;um by bonds of the &s;ame kind.
The &s;tatute in that ca&s;e, according to the con&s;truc|tion
given it, would have the effect to le&s;&s;en
the fund appointed by law for younger chil|dren.
But we need not go to particular ca&s;es:
in every bond there is a debtor, as well as a cre|ditor;
and if bonds bearing intere&s;t be render|ed
&s;imply moveable, it follows nece&s;&s;arily, that
as far as the children or next in kin of the cre|ditor
are profited, &s;o far preci&s;ely are the chil|dren
or next in kin of the debtor burdened.
In&s;tead of providing for younger children, this
con&s;truction enriches &s;ome, and reduces others
to poverty, without predilection, or cau&s;e of pre|ference.
What is this better, than giving with
one hand, and taking back with the other?
Where then is the remeid for the &startq;hard condi|tion
of a great number of orphans and father|le&s;s
children, who being di&s;appointed of their
natural portion, are brought to great mi&s;ery,&endq;
<PB N="303" REF="318">
&amp;c.? The plain purpo&s;e of the &s;tatute, which is
to enlarge the legal provi&s;ion of younger children,
can only be fulfilled, by enlarging the provi&s;ion
of the creditor's children; leaving the debtor's
children to common law as formerly. And
therefore, upon the whole, it may with certainty
be concluded, that bonds bearing intere&s;t are
moveable <HI>quoad creditorem,</HI> but heritable <HI>quoad
debitorem.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Analy&s;is of act of &s;ederunt 28th Februa|ry
1662, concerning executors-credi|tors.</HEAD>
<P>THE heir who repre&s;ents his predece&s;&s;or,
and is held to be <HI>eadem per&s;ona</HI> with him,
&s;ucceeds to every heritable &s;ubject. But with re|&s;pect
to moveable &s;ubjects, there is no heir:
the&s;e are managed by an executor appointed by
the proprietor him&s;elf; and failing his nomina|tion,
they are managed by an executor whom
the commi&s;&s;ary-court appoints. It is the office
of the executor to convert the effects into mo|ney,
and to di&s;tribute the money among the per|&s;ons
intere&s;ted, the creditors, relict, next in kin,
legatees, &amp;c.</P>
<P>As per&s;onal debts are not ordained to be re|corded,
it is implied in the very nature of an ex|ecutor's
office, that di&s;tribution be delayed till
the per&s;ons intere&s;ted have time to put in their
claims; for it would be gro&s;s inju&s;tice, that an ho|ne&s;t
creditor &s;hould be cut out becau&s;e he can|not
run &s;o fa&s;t as another. By our law the heir
was not &s;ubjected to per&s;onal debts till the
moveables were exhau&s;ted; and by act 76.
parl. 1503, the heir's defence, That the moveables
<PB N="305" REF="320">
mu&s;t fir&s;t be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, is re&s;tricted to a year after
the predece&s;&s;or's death. A year was thought
&s;ufficient for the executor, to convert the effects
into money, and to di&s;tribute the &s;ame among
the creditors; after which they had acce&s;s to the
heir. Whence it became the executor's duty,
to appoint a time within the year for the credi|tors
to receive payment, and to di&s;tribute among
them the funds collected. This &s;alutary form of
management came to be neglected, through the
ignorance of executors, or their partiality; and
for many years payment made to the fir&s;t comer
has been &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>This irregular practice, productive of much
inju&s;tice, was taken under con&s;ideration by the
commi&s;&s;ioners for admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in
Scotland appointed by Oliver Cromwell. In their
regulations 1654, article 16. it is enacted, &startq;That
hereafter there be no executors-creditors de|cerned
and confirmed to any defunct, until
half a year be pa&s;t after the defunct's de|cea&s;e.&endq;
&startq;And in the 18th article it is enacted,
That no decreet for payment be extracted a|gain&s;t
any executor, for &s;ix months after the
defunct's decea&s;e; and that all creditors who
&s;hall u&s;e diligence again&s;t the executor within
the &s;aid &s;ix months, &s;hall come in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI>
with others that have decreets ready to ex|tract.&endq;
The fir&s;t of the&s;e articles &s;eems in|tended
to give time to the commi&s;&s;aries to chu&s;e
<PB N="306" REF="321">
a proper per&s;on for managing the effects, termed
<HI>executor-dative,</HI> preferring always the next in
kin, if they apply. The other is intended for a
&s;till more &s;alutary purpo&s;e; which is, to prevent
per&s;onal creditors from taking the &s;tart of one
another, by what is termed <HI>nimious diligence;</HI>
in&s;tead of having the moveable effects of their
decea&s;ed debtor divided equally among them.
As the&s;e regulations fell to the ground on the
Re&s;toration the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion interpo&s;ed by
the act of &s;ederunt under con&s;ideration. I &s;ee
not clearly why the article fir&s;t mentioned was
rejected: perhaps it was thought, that there was
no harm in allowing creditors to confirm within
the &s;ix months, when it gave them no preference.
But the other article was completely adopted;
the act of &s;ederunt in effect declaring, &startq;That no
diligence done within &s;ix months of the pro|prietor's
death &s;hall give a preference; but
that all creditors doing diligence within that
time &s;hall come in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u.</HI>&endq; If no dili|gence
done within the &s;ix months give a preference,
it follows nece&s;&s;arily, that the executor is with|held
from making payment within the &s;ix months.
It was probably thought, that a year was too
long a delay; e&s;pecially as creditors who appear
after the &s;ix months, and after the moveables are
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, have acce&s;s to the heir.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be an inference from the act of &s;e|derunt,
that a per&s;onal creditor who obtains not
<PB N="307" REF="322">
payment from the executor, may, after the &s;ix
months, betake him&s;elf to the heir; and as the
&s;tatute 1503 was now in di&s;u&s;e, it is probable that
creditors were early indulged with this privilege.
Per&s;onal creditors, grudging even this &s;hort delay
of &s;ix months, have acquired, by a further in|dulgence
of the court, a &s;till greater privilege;
which is, to attack the heir without any delay.
And yet, as the heir with re&s;pect to moveable
debts is cautioner only, there is neither law nor
equity for making him liable, till the executor be
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. So cautious was the &s;tatute 1503 in
this particular, that the heir was not bound to
pay even after the year, till the executor found
caution to relieve him to the extent of the move|able
effects. In our pre&s;ent practice, he is made
liable even before the executor him&s;elf is liable;
for however exten&s;ive the moveables may be, an
executor is not bound to pay any debt within
&s;ix months of the debtor's death. Whether this
practice can be ju&s;tified upon any rational prin|ciple,
is left to be examined by our able&s;t
lawyers.</P>
<P>The act of parliament 1661, to prevent ni|mious
diligence, ranks <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> upon the he|ritable
e&s;tate, all creditors who adjudge within
year and day of the fir&s;t effectual adjudication:
and the act of &s;ederunt under con&s;ideration, to
prevent nimious diligence upon the per&s;onal e|&s;tate,
ranks <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> all creditors who do dili|gence
<PB N="308" REF="323">
within &s;ix months after the death of the
debtor. Other competitions among per&s;onal cre|ditors
are left to common law; and to the&s;e we
proceed. The ca&s;e of an executor-nominate,
of an executor-dative, and of an executor next
in kin, &s;hall take the lead. The office of the
two fir&s;t named is purely mini&s;terial: with re&s;pect
to creditors, the office of the la&s;t is the &s;ame:
they retain indeed the free re&s;idue; but that cir|cum&s;tance
has no influence in a competition a|mong
creditors. It is the duty of the&s;e execu|tors
to convert the effects into money, and to di&s;|tribute
the money among the creditors and o|thers
intere&s;ted. If a proce&s;s be commenced a|gain&s;t
any of them before the effects are convert|ed
into money, no decree can pa&s;s again&s;t him
for payment: the decree can only be declarato|ry,
&startq;that he &s;hall be bound to pay to the pur&s;uer
a proportion of the money ari&s;ing from a &s;ale
of the effects;&endq; which means no more but to
&s;ecure to the creditor his &s;hare in the di&s;tribution.
Though a proce&s;s be commenced again&s;t him,
after the effects are converted into money, but
before di&s;tribution, he is not however bound to
pay within the &s;ix months. But when the&s;e are
elap&s;ed, and no interpellation by any other cre|ditor,
he is bound to make payment; and a de|cree
again&s;t him for payment will afford a prefer|ence
to the pur&s;uer again&s;t all other creditors ap|pearing
afterward; for it would be unju&s;t, that
<PB N="309" REF="324">
the creditor &s;hould &s;uffer by the executor's fault,
who ought to have made payment in&s;tead of al|lowing
a decree to go again&s;t him. If there be
an interpellation by other creditors, before the
pur&s;uer has obtained his decree for payment,
it is the duty of the executor to call all of them
in a multiple-poinding; and in that proce&s;s the
creditors will be ranked <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u,</HI> if no ob|jection
lie again&s;t any particular debt.</P>
<P>Next of the ca&s;e where a creditor is confirmed.
His confirmation, which is a &s;pecies of legal di|ligence,
intitles him, at common law, to retain
&s;uch a proportion of the &s;ubjects confirmed as
will &s;atisfy his claim; and to that extent he mu&s;t
be preferred. The &s;urplus, if any be, is divided
among the other creditors, according to the rule
above laid down: if there be but one creditor to
claim the &s;urplus, he mu&s;t have it; if a plurality,
it mu&s;t be divided among them in a multiple|poinding.</P>
<P>Hitherto the rules of competition are &s;imple.
Ca&s;es may be figured more complex, where the
competition is regulated, partly by common law,
and partly by the act of &s;ederunt; as where &s;ome
creditors have cited the executor within the &s;ix
months, and &s;ome after. The former are rank|ed
<HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> by the act of &s;ederunt. But the
act does not prefer them before creditors who&s;e
citations are after the &s;ix months. The competi|tion
in that ca&s;e is le&s;t to common law; and
<PB N="310" REF="325">
at common law all creditors are ranked <HI>pari
pa&s;&s;u</HI> who have not obtained a decree for pay|ment
again&s;t the executor. This may occa&s;ion
an intricate competition. Suppo&s;e the follow|ing.
A creditor confirms within the &s;ix months;
and proce&s;&s;es are rai&s;ed again&s;t him by two o|ther
creditors, John within the &s;ix months, James
after. Let the fund be 12, and each of the
debts 8. I begin with computing what each cre|ditor
ought to receive at common law, laying a|&s;ide
the act of &s;ederunt; and then proceed to
examine what alteration is made by the act. At
common law, the creditor confirmed would draw
his whole &s;um, leaving 4, the remainder of the
fund, to John and James. By this computation,
James is intitled to 2, which is all that he can
ultimately draw, being neither hurt nor benefited
by the act. We &s;hall next examine what John
is intitled to draw by virtue of the act. The de|claration,
that he &s;hall come in <HI>pari pa&s;&s;u</HI> with
the creditor confirmed, means not, that he &s;hall
draw equally with the creditor confirmed, but
only that the confirmation &s;hall give no prefer|ence.
Now, laying a&s;ide the confirmation, John
can draw but 4, being the third part of the
fund; for it is not the intention of the act of
&s;ederunt, that any creditor &s;hould draw more than
a ju&s;t proportion. The re&s;ult of the whole is,
that the executor confirmed draws 6, John 4,
James 2. This is a &s;pecimen of many intri|cate
<PB N="311" REF="326">
competitions that may occur upon the act
of &s;ederunt. And upon trial, it will be found no
le&s;s fruitful of &s;uch competitions among per&s;onal
creditors, than the &s;tatute 1661 is among real
creditors.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">What teinds are given to the patron by
act 23. parl. 1690.</HEAD>
<P>IN Scotland, e&s;pecially after the Reformation,
the patron, be&s;ide the power of pre&s;enting a
mini&s;ter to &s;erve the cure, enjoyed the privilege
of bargaining with the pre&s;entee for a moderate
&s;tipend; which of cour&s;e intitled the patron to the
&s;urplus of the teinds; and the bargain was com|monly
executed in the form of a lea&s;e granted by
the pre&s;entee to the patron. The patron's right
to the &s;urplus teind, is countenanced by &s;everal
acts of parliament; particularly by act 1. parl.
1612, declaring it lawful for the patron to make
an agreement with the pre&s;entee, provided a com|petent
maintenance be re&s;erved to him. And in
the act 1649, aboli&s;hing the patron's power of
pre&s;entation, his right to the teinds is there de|clared
to be good and valid. Again, upon the
re&s;titution of Epi&s;copacy ann. 1662, when the
act 1649 was re&s;cinded, the patron's right to en|joy
the &s;urplus teinds is admitted. See particu|larly
act 9. parl. 1661, at the end. La&s;tly, when
by the act under con&s;ideration the power of pre|&s;entation
was taken from the patron, and be|&s;towed
on the heritors, it is declared, that the
<PB N="313" REF="328">
teinds &s;hall belong to the patron, with the burden
of the mini&s;ter's &s;tipend. And now, by this &s;ta|tute,
the patron has a direct right to the teinds,
in&s;tead of the indirect right he formerly had by
a tack of the teinds procured from the pre&s;entee.</P>
<P>This &s;hort &s;ketch paves the way for examining
what teinds were given to the patron by the act
under con&s;ideration, in lieu of his power of pre|&s;entation.
The que&s;tion occurred in a memora|ble
ca&s;e determined in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, the
particulars of which follow. James VI. by char|ter
dated 7th March 1593, granted the abbey of
Dunfermline, including the teinds, to his con&s;ort
Queen Anne, and to the heirs procreated betwixt
them; whom failing, to his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors
in the crown of Scotland. By virtue of that grant,
ratified in parliament ann. 1612, the teinds of the
abbey of Dunfermline are now in the crown.</P>
<P>The teinds of the pari&s;h of Kirkmichael, part
of the &s;aid abbey, were claimed by the patron
upon the &s;aid act 1690, as free teinds in the
crown. It was an&s;wered, That the teinds of the
abbey having been heritably di&s;poned as above
mentioned, belong not to the patron; becau&s;e,
by the act 1690, no teinds are be&s;towed on the
patron, but free teinds not heritably di&s;poned.
Several other objections being made to the pa|tron's
claim, a judgement was given on the
whole, rejecting the claim; and there was no
judgement given on the pre&s;ent point in particu|lar.
<PB N="314" REF="329">
But it occurred at advi&s;ing, that the le|gi&s;lature,
in making the act 1690, intended no
more but to pre&s;erve entire to the patron &s;uch
right to the teinds, as he enjoyed before by means
of a tack procured from the pre&s;entee, having
now no opportunity to procure &s;uch a tack. But
as the mini&s;ters of the pari&s;hes belonging to the
abbey of Dunfermline are not titulars of the
teinds of the&s;e pari&s;hes, they could not grant a
tack of them to the patron. This was illu&s;trated
from the ca&s;e of teinds that belonged to bi&s;hops
during Epi&s;copacy. The&s;e teinds are now in the
crown, and may in one view be con&s;idered as
free teinds. Yet no patron ever pretended right
to the&s;e; and the patron is no better founded in
his claim to the teinds under con&s;ideration.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Commentary on act 35. parl. 1693, con|cerning
procuratories of re&s;ignation and
precepts of &s;ei&s;in.</HEAD>
<P>MAN, a voluntary agent, governs him&s;elf
and his concerns by his own will; and,
in order to fulfil it, he exerts external acts. I
deliver an ox that I &s;old, or a pur&s;e of money
that I promi&s;ed: no per&s;on ever doubted, but
that the property is transferred by delivery pur|&s;uant
to my will. But it requires a habit of ab&s;|traction,
to &s;eparate a man's will from him&s;elf,
&s;o as to conceive it operating after his death.
Such ab&s;traction is above the power of a &s;a|vage;
and probably was not thought of before
writing was introduced in legal acts. A writ ex|pre&s;&s;ing
a man's will, is vi&s;ible and tangible:
the will adhering to the paper, is pre&s;erved in ex|i&s;tence
even after the man's death. Hence the
efficacy of a latter-will or te&s;tament in writ, to
give right to a legatee, and to direct things to
be done after death; the nomination, for ex|ample,
of tutors and curators, of tru&s;tees to &s;ell
land for payment of debt, and &s;uch like<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Principles of Equity, edit. 2. p. 239.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="331">
Seeing, by the law of nature, a man's will is
effectual after his death, I am at a lo&s;s to di&s;cover
upon what ground it is laid down in general,
<HI>Quod morte mandantis perit mandatum,</HI> unle&s;s
that it has been e&s;tabli&s;hed before writing was
u&s;ed in law-proceedings. That a mandate for be|hoof
of the mandant &s;hould fall by the death of the
mandatary, is rational: I employ an architect to
build a hou&s;e for me; and he dies before a &s;tone
is laid: I am not bound to employ the heir, who
perhaps is a weaver; and if I be not bound to
employ him, he cannot be bound to &s;erve me.
Another rea&s;on concurs, drawn from the nature
of repre&s;entation: An heir repre&s;ents not his pre|dece&s;&s;or
with re&s;pect to things purely per&s;onal,
<HI>quae inhaerent o&s;&s;ibus,</HI> as expre&s;&s;ed by a Roman
writer. Suppo&s;ing the architect to die after per|forming
part of his work, the heir is not bound
to complete it, nor am I bound to employ the
heir. But neither of the&s;e rea&s;ons conclude for
making a mandate depend on the life of the man|dant.
His will, we have &s;een, operates after his
death in his te&s;tament, and in a &s;ettlement of his
e&s;tate. Why &s;hould it not equally operate in a
mandate given by him to do &s;omething for him
after his death?</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, I am far from in&s;i&s;ting, that
every mandate mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t after the death of the
mandant. The propo&s;ition I maintain is only,
that there is nothing in the nature of a mandate
<PB N="317" REF="332">
or commi&s;&s;ion, to make it fall with the mandant;
but that its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence or not &s;ub&s;i&s;tence after his
death, depends on what is purpo&s;ed to be done
by it. To explain this propo&s;ition, a mandate
created for behoof of the mandant him&s;elf, mu&s;t
be di&s;tingui&s;hed from a mandate created for be|hoof
of another per&s;on. A mandate in the for|mer
ca&s;e mu&s;t fall with the mandant; becau&s;e
the end for which it was created, cannot now be
fulfilled. Take, for example, a commi&s;&s;ion to
buy a hor&s;e for my riding: my death mu&s;t put
an end to this commi&s;&s;ion, which cannot now be
fulfilled. But where the mandate is of &s;uch a
nature as not to depend on my life, why ought
it not to &s;tand as well as a te&s;tament or latter-will?
The per&s;on who undertakes, at my re|que&s;t,
to erect a monument for me after my
death, is bound both in law and con&s;cience.
The like where a per&s;on undertakes to lay out
my money at intere&s;t after my death, or to pur|cha&s;e
land with it, or to give &s;ome part in cha|rity.
By what authority does an executor nomi|nate
exerci&s;e his office after the te&s;tator's death,
other than his mandate? Tho&s;e who maintain
the general rule, mu&s;t admit the ca&s;es mentioned
to be &s;o many exceptions. But they do not
advert, that the rea&s;on upon which the&s;e excep|tions
are founded, prove that the rule is not ge|neral,
but that the purpo&s;e of the mandate is the
rule.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="333">
With re&s;pect to a mandate given for behoof of
the mandatary, or of a third per&s;on, it may be
laid down as a general rule, That the mandate
dies not with the mandant. I commi&s;&s;ion a friend
to buy a hor&s;e for him&s;elf, intending it as a pre|&s;ent.
The mandate will be effectual, even where
it is executed after my death; and my heir will
be liable for the price. I give a commi&s;&s;ion to
buy a hor&s;e for my &s;on, or for my brother; but
die &s;uddenly, without affording time for execu|tion.
Does my death put an end to the commi&s;|&s;ion,
without evidence or probablity of change of
mind? Adhering to the general rule above laid
down, a &s;pecial a&s;&s;ignment, containing a power
to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the moveables &s;pecified there|in,
will intitle the a&s;&s;ignee, even after the ce|dent's
death, to lay hold of the&s;e moveables at
&s;hort hand, if not ob&s;tructed by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
another. Such power in a general a&s;&s;ignment
cannot indeed be exerci&s;ed after the cedent's
death: not that the power has fallen; but that
our law permits not intromi&s;&s;ion with the goods
of a per&s;on decea&s;ed, but by inventory, which
renders confirmation nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>There is one &s;ort of mandate that nece&s;&s;arily
falls by the death of the mandant, whether given
for his own behoof, or for behoof of any other;
and that is a mandate to act for him, and in his
name. A procuratory of re&s;ignation and pre|cept
of &s;ei&s;in are of that &s;ort. The con&s;tituent's
<PB N="319" REF="334">
death puts an end to &s;uch mandates; becau&s;e he
cannot be repre&s;ented after his death, nor can a|ny
one act in his name. A procurator, after the
proprietor's death, cannot in his name &s;urrender
the land to the &s;uperior; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on,
the proprietor's death mu&s;t put an end to a pre|cept
of &s;ei&s;in. <HI>Procurator</HI> and <HI>bailie</HI> are rela|lative
terms; and there cannot be a procurator
or bailie without a con&s;tituent, more than there
can be a &s;hadow without a &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>An obligation for a &s;um of money, without
mentioning a&s;&s;ignees, is not a&s;&s;ignable. To &s;up|ply
that want, a method was invented to a&s;&s;ign
it indirectly, by giving a procuratory to the a&s;&s;ig|nee
to u&s;e the cedent's name in demanding pay|ment.
But this was an imperfect method: if
the cedent died before intimation, the procura|tory
died with him; and the a&s;&s;ignee's only re|&s;ource
was a proce&s;s again&s;t the cedent's repre|&s;entatives,
to make up a title to the &s;ubject a&s;|&s;igned,
and to grant a new a&s;&s;ignment. Intima|tion
during the cedent's life, was indeed held &s;uf|ficient
to transfer the <HI>jus crediti</HI> to the a&s;&s;ignee,
intitling him to drop his character of procurator,
and to act in his own name. But for what rea|&s;on,
I have not yet di&s;covered: the intimation
mu&s;t be in the cedent's name, as the a&s;&s;ignee
has nothing to &s;ay to the debtor, but <HI>qua pro|curator;</HI>
and his proce&s;s again&s;t the debtor for
<PB N="320" REF="335">
payment, ought to be carried on in the &s;ame
character. Does it not follow, that after the
cedent's death, his only re&s;ource, notwith&s;tand|ing
the intimation, is the proce&s;s above mention|ed?
But principles make little impre&s;&s;ion on
the illiterate; and are little regarded, provided
the end can be accompli&s;hed in whatever man|ner.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tood the law down to the year 1693,
when the act of parliament under con&s;ideration
was made, authori&s;ing procuratories of re&s;igna|tion,
and precepts of &s;ei&s;in, to be executed after
the granter's death; and al&s;o authori&s;ing &s;pecial
a&s;&s;ignments to be intimated after the cedent's
death. The privilege was not extended to gene|ral
a&s;&s;ignments; which, as ob&s;erved above, re|quire
confirmation. To make this &s;tatute accord
with principles, has not been attempted by any
writer: nor does it &s;eem to be an ea&s;y ta&s;k; for
&s;urely the legi&s;lature could not mean to impower
one to act <HI>procuratorio nomine,</HI> without a con&s;ti|tuent.
I under&s;tand the &s;tatute as impowering
the&s;e &s;everal acts to be done, not <HI>procuratorio
nomine,</HI> but by expre&s;s authority of the &s;tatute.
By that authority, the land is &s;urrendered into
the hands of the &s;uperior, infeftment is given on
the precept, and intimation is made of the a&s;&s;ign|ment.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to have been no occa&s;ion for a
<PB N="321" REF="336">
&s;tatute with re&s;pect to the ca&s;e la&s;t mentioned.
The &s;imple addition of the word <HI>a&s;&s;ignees</HI> in a
money-obligation, removes all difficulties. Were
our forefathers &s;o defective in invention, as to
overlook an improvement &s;o obvious? If I bind
my&s;elf to pay a &s;um to John, I am not bound
to pay it to James: but if I bind my&s;elf to pay
to John, or to his a&s;&s;ignee, the bond has a free
circulation. The a&s;&s;ignee can in&s;i&s;t again&s;t me
in his own name, without needing a procura|tory:
h$ can intimate in his own name, whe|ther
the cedent be dead or alive; and his di&s;|charge
to me in his own name extingui&s;hes
the debt. All money-obligations are now made
payable to the creditor's heirs and a&s;&s;ignees; and if
a&s;&s;ignees happen to be omitted in a bond for bor|rowed
money, the omi&s;&s;ion, which is under&s;tood
the effect of over&s;ight, will be &s;upplied in equity,
without needing the authority of an act of parlia|ment.</P>
<P>Procuratories and precepts concerning land-rights,
may, I think, be &s;o worded, as to be ef|fectual
after the death of the granter. It is made
out above, that a power granted by me to take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a moveable after my death, is effec|tual
at common law: why not al&s;o, where the
power is to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of land? Having &s;old
land to be held of my&s;elf, I grant a precept to
my bailie, impowering him to deliver po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to
the purcha&s;er, whether I be dead or alive. I &s;ee
<PB N="322" REF="337">
not, that an in&s;trument of &s;ei&s;in taken on the de|livery,
&s;hould be le&s;s effectual than an in&s;trument
of &s;ei&s;in taken in common form. The &s;tatute
declares it equally effectual; and if the powers
of a bailie can be enlarged by &s;tatute for the
benefit of all concerned, why not, by private au|thority?
Upon the &s;ame plan of rea&s;oning, a
&s;tatute is as little nece&s;&s;ary for &s;urrendering land
into the hands of the &s;uperior after the di&s;po|ner's
death. It appears to me, that this rea|&s;oning
mu&s;t hold while the land remains <HI>in here|ditate
jacente</HI> of the di&s;poner. Widely differ|ent
is the &s;cene, after the heir is &s;erved and in|feft.
By the rules that govern the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion
of property, no procuratory nor precept can
avail, but what is given by the pre&s;ent pro|prietor;
and for that rea&s;on, the moment an
heir is infeft, his predece&s;&s;or's procuratory or
precept falls to the ground. And if it was in|tended
by the legi&s;lature, that they &s;hould be
effectual in this ca&s;e, it was undoubtedly right to
make a &s;tatute.</P>
<P>But that this was the intention of the &s;tatute,
is far from being clear. Like mo&s;t of the &s;ta|tutes
of that period, it is extremely imperfect.
The enactment is, &startq;That procuratories and
precepts &s;hall &s;ub&s;i&s;t after the death of the
granters:&endq; how long, and in what ca&s;es,
is not &s;aid. They mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t while the &s;ubject
is <HI>in hereditate jacente</HI> of the di&s;poner; for
<PB N="323" REF="338">
if the &s;tatute have not that effect, it has no ef|fect.
But was it al&s;o intended, that they &s;hould
&s;ub&s;i&s;t after the &s;ubject is ve&s;ted in the heir? If
we can draw any light, it mu&s;t be from the pre|amble:
there is not a word of it in the body of
the &s;tatute; though an effect &s;o contradictory to
common law, ought not to have been left upon
conjecture. The preamble complains of &startq;the
great and unnece&s;&s;ary expence occa&s;ioned by
obtaining procuratories and precepts to be
renewed.&endq; This complaint refers to the heir
infeft, the only per&s;on who can renew them.
An heir infeft is bound indeed at common law
to renew a procuratory or precept granted by
his predece&s;&s;or: but &s;eldom is this obtained with|out
a proce&s;s; and the intention of the legi&s;la|ture
probably was to &s;ave the expence and delay
of that proce&s;s. In &s;hort, it &s;eems to be the pur|po&s;e
of the &s;tatute, to enable a di&s;ponee, at &s;hort
hand, to execute his procuratory or precept, in
every ca&s;e where the repre&s;entative is bound to
renew it.</P>
<P>It may then &s;afely be concluded, that procu|ratories
and precepts &s;tand good even after the
heir is infeft. There the privilege &s;tops; for
&s;urely it was not intended, that a procuratory or
precept &s;hould &s;tand good again&s;t a purcha&s;er
infeft, even &s;uppo&s;ing him to be a gratuitous
purcha&s;er. A man di&s;pones his land twice; and
after the &s;econd purcha&s;er is infeft, the di&s;poner
<PB N="324" REF="339">
dies. The fir&s;t purcha&s;er can take no benefit
by executing his procuratory or precept; becau&s;e
his taking infeftment will not deprive the &s;econd
purcha&s;er of the property. And therefore, it
mu&s;t not be pre&s;umed, that the privilege was
meant to be extended to this ca&s;e. During the
di&s;poner's life, the fir&s;t purcha&s;er can execute
his procuratory or precept, without needing an
act of parliament; but in vain would he take
infeftment, which would give him no hold of
the land in competition with the &s;econd pur|cha&s;er
fir&s;t infeft. And after the di&s;poner's
death, why &s;hould the fir&s;t purcha&s;er be autho|ri&s;ed
by a &s;tatute to do what would be idle to do?</P>
<P>The &s;ame rea&s;oning is applicable to an herita|ble
bond with procuratory and precept. After
granting &s;uch a bond, the debtor &s;ells the land,
and the purcha&s;er immediately takes infeftment.
From what is &s;aid above, it is evident, that the
&s;tatute gives no aid to the creditor. But did
not the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion teach a very different
doctrine in a deci&s;ion July 1758; where it was
found, that infeftment taken by the creditor
after his debtor's decea&s;e, and after the land
was ve&s;ted in the crown by the debtor's forfei|ture,
did however prefer him before all the per|&s;onal
creditors of the forfeiting per&s;on? I an|&s;wer,
No. This deci&s;ion differs not from the
doctrine above laid down; becau&s;e, with re|&s;pect

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Analy&s;is of article 25. regulations 1695,
concerning decreets-arbitral.</HEAD>
<P>JUdges originally were no le&s;s limited in their
powers than arbiters are. Their authority
was derived from the con&s;ent of the litigants:
liti&s;conte&s;tation was in reality a contract; and
the decree of a judge had preci&s;ely the &s;ame ef|fect
with an award pronounced by an arbiter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 9.</NOTE>.
When judges, in the maturity of government,
were inve&s;ted with authority to make their de|crees
effectual, the con&s;ent of litigants cea&s;ed to
be nece&s;&s;ary. But as impre&s;&s;ions &s;eldom wear
out with the cau&s;es that produced them, the ori|ginal
re&s;emblance between the decree of a judge
and that of an arbiter, was kept up in &s;uperficial
rea&s;oning, and in law-language, even &s;o far as
to infer, that a decreet-arbitral, like the decree
of a judge, may be rever&s;ed in a court of law.
This was an inference wonderfully gro&s;s: what can
be more obvious, than that to reduce a decreet-arbitral
for iniquity, is in effect to hold, that a
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is not binding? To correct this er|ror,
it is enacted in the 25th article of the regu|lations
<PB N="327" REF="342">
1695, &startq;That for the cutting off ground|le&s;s
and expen&s;ive pleas and proce&s;&s;es in time
coming, the Lords of Council and Se&s;&s;ion &s;u&s;|tain
no reduction of any decreet-arbitral that
&s;hall be pronounced hereafter upon a &s;ub&s;cri|bed
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, at the in&s;tance of any of the
parties &s;ubmitters, upon any cau&s;e or rea&s;on
what&s;oever, unle&s;s that of corruption, bribery,
or fal&s;ehood, to be alledged again&s;t the judges|arbitrators
who pronounced the &s;ame.&endq; By
this regulation, a decreet-arbitral obtains its pro|per
effect; for when parties agree to be bound
by the opinion of an arbiter, his opinion, even
where erroneous, mu&s;t be the rule. But then
it mu&s;t be his opinion: if an arbiter, from what|ever
motive, pronounce contrary to his opinion,
the parties are not bound; becau&s;e the agree|ment
is to &s;ubmit to his opinion, not to what
he &s;hall pronounce contrary to his opinion.</P>
<P>Upon this the que&s;tion occurs, What rule
have we to judge whether a decreet-arbitral be
the opinion of the arbiter or not? The article
under con&s;ideration, an&s;wers that que&s;tion. An
arbiter is pre&s;umed to pronounce his decree ac|cording
to con&s;cience, unle&s;s corruption, bribery,
or fal&s;ehood, be proved again&s;t him.</P>
<P>In &s;upporting a decreet-arbitral again&s;t an ob|jection
of error in judgement, it is taken for
granted, that the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is complete in all its
formalities, and that the arbiter acts according
<PB N="328" REF="343">
to the powers given him by the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.
There was no occa&s;ion for any regulation as to
points that belong to common law. If an arbi|ter
act <HI>ultra vires,</HI> his decreet is void at com|mon
law, at lea&s;t as far as it is <HI>ultra vires.</HI> And
if the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion be reduced upon a legal objec|tion,
the decreet-arbitral mu&s;t fall with it: If a
man, for example, be fraudulently induced to
enter into a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion will be
voided in a reduction, and the parties be decla|red
free. And if one be compelled by force or
fear to &s;ub&s;cribe a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he is not bound
either by the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion or decreet-arbitral. In
this manner, a party may be loo&s;ed from the fet|ters
of a decreet-arbitral, without any violence
done to the article under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I go one &s;tep further. By the regulations un|der
con&s;ideration, &startq;the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion &s;hall
&s;u&s;tain no reduction of a decreet-arbitral upon
any cau&s;e or rea&s;on whatever, except corrup|tion,&endq;
&amp;c. But they are not prohibited to
&s;u&s;tain grounds of nullity that require not a pro|ce&s;s
of reduction, e&s;pecially if in&s;tantly verified.
Nor do I re&s;t upon words. I found upon inten|tion
chiefly; and urge, that it could not be the
intention of the legi&s;lature, to &s;upport a decreet|arbitral
that is <HI>ip&s;o jure</HI> null, and no better than
a piece of wa&s;te paper. I proceed to examples;
and the fir&s;t is, that the decreet-arbitral is found|ed
on an error in fact; as where John, debtor
<PB N="329" REF="344">
in L. 100 to William decea&s;ed, is ordained to
pay that &s;um to James, as the only child of Wil|liam,
when in fact there are &s;everal other chil|dren
of William. The decreet-arbitral is void,
becau&s;e it determines a ca&s;e that is not, and
leaves the real ca&s;e undetermined. But here
the error mu&s;t appear on the face of the writing:
con&s;iderations or rea&s;onings pa&s;&s;ing in the mind
of a judge, or of an arbiter, are not the &s;ubject
of proof independent of the writing. An error
in fact that is not the foundation of the award,
will not be regarded. A piece of ground, com|puted
to be ten acres, being controverted be|tween
John and James; the arbiter determines
the ten acres to belong to the former. The
decreet-arbitral will be effectual though the
ground is found to be twenty acres; for if it be
po&s;&s;ible that the arbiter might have given the
&s;ame award though he had known the real
fact, the pre&s;umption mu&s;t lie for the decreet-arbitral.
See <HI>In&s;tit. De legatis,</HI> &sect; 31. Another
nullity is, that the premi&s;&s;es are incon&s;i&s;tent
with the conclu&s;ion: &startq;Becau&s;e John owes
L. 500 to James, I ordain James to pay that
&s;um to John.&endq; Take a third example: It
is implied in every &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that the arbi|ter
&s;hall pronounce an award upon every article
&s;ubmitted, and leave no point open to future
controver&s;y. It is accordingly a nullity in a de|creet-arbitral
<PB N="330" REF="345">
that there is a point left open which
ought to have been determined. The&s;e particu|lars
are &s;ufficient for a &s;pecimen: nullities may
be figured without end.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Commentary on act 22. parliament 1685,
concerning entails.</HEAD>
<P>THat no man can name a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his
heir, is a maxim in the Roman law,
founded on the very nature of property; which
accordingly is al&s;o a maxim in the law of Scot|land.
Land, or any &s;ubject belonging to me,
is at my di&s;po&s;al: but when my heir &s;ucceeds, it
belongs to him, and is at his di&s;po&s;al. My will
cannot regulate the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to an e&s;tate that
now belongs to my heir, more than it can regu|late
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to an e&s;tate that never belong|ed
to me. The only means in my power for
making my will effectual in this ca&s;e, is the ta|king
my heir bound to make the per&s;on named
by me his heir; which, in the Roman law, is
termed <HI>fide commi&s;&s;um</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This maxim holds in property only, not in
rights grafted on property. If a man make a grant
burdening his land-property, and in the grant
name a &s;eries of heirs to &s;ucceed to the grantee;
neither the grantee, nor any of his heirs named, can,
without con&s;ent of the granter, or his heirs, al|ter
<PB N="333" REF="348">
the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. A proprietor cannot
limit his own heirs, who have the power of di&s;po|&s;al
as amply as he had; but a proprietor is not
bound to &s;uffer any to po&s;&s;e&s;s his land, but tho&s;e
he has con&s;ented to. Even in Rome, where the
maxim was inviolable, it was never doubted, but
that in a perpetual lea&s;e, termed <HI>emphyteu&s;is,</HI> or
in any lea&s;e, the proprietor and le&s;&s;ee in conjunc|tion
can name the per&s;ons who &s;hall &s;ucceed in
the lea&s;e. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the nomination
of heirs in a feudal grant, is con&s;i&s;tent with the
&s;tricte&s;t principles of property: the &s;uperior con|tinues
proprietor; and he is not bound to admit
as his va&s;&s;al or tenant, any but the per&s;ons he
has con&s;ented to. Thus it came to be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
by means of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, not that a man
&s;ingly can regulate the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his heir, but
that a va&s;&s;al, with con&s;ent of his &s;uperior, can &s;ub|&s;titute
heirs without end, to enjoy his e&s;tate one
after another.</P>
<P>In the feudal &s;y&s;tem, the land is the &s;uperior's
property; and the va&s;&s;al has the u&s;ufruct only,
differing little in &s;ub&s;tance from a liferent. The
va&s;&s;al may di&s;po&s;e of what belongs to him&s;elf;
but as the land is not his property, no deed
done by him can affect either the &s;uperior, or
the heirs of inve&s;titure. And thus, by the feu|dal
&s;y&s;tem, every land-e&s;tate was in effect en|tailed.</P>
<P>But the feudal &s;y&s;tem was a violent encroach|ment
<PB N="334" REF="349">
on the natural rights of men: nature at la&s;t
prevailed, and overturned the tottering edifice.
Even in Scotland, it is reduced to a &s;hadow: the
&s;ub&s;tance is gone, and little left but its formali|ties.
The property, which originally was re&s;er|ved
by the &s;uperior, is transferred to the va&s;&s;al;
and his will governs, not that of the &s;uperior.
Land is now re&s;tored to commerce, and is bought
and &s;old like other merchandi&s;e. That this in
England was the condition of land-property as
early as Edward I. appears from the &s;tatute <HI>Quia
emptores terrarum,</HI> enacting, &startq;That a va&s;&s;al
may &s;ell his land without con&s;ent of the &s;upe|rior,
and that the &s;uperior &s;hall receive the
purcha&s;er as his va&s;&s;al.&endq; Here was an end to
entails, as far as founded on the feudal &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>But men, who in peaceable times found lei&s;ure
to think of perpetuating their name and family,
took di&s;like at the free commerce of land; and
wi&s;hed for the feudal law as far as it an&s;wered
their views. When a grant of land is made to a
family, conditioned to return to the granter and
his heirs after extinction of that family, it was
thought hard, that the grantee, or any of his
heirs, &s;hould have it in their power to di&s;appoint
the donor by aliening the land. To relieve from
that hard&s;hip, the Engli&s;h &s;tatute, <HI>De donis con|ditionalibus,</HI>
was made<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">13. Edward I. cap. 1.</NOTE>. It proceeds on the
<PB N="335" REF="350">
recital, fir&s;t, of land given to a man and his wife,
and their i&s;&s;ue, conditionally, that if they die
without i&s;&s;ue, the land &s;hall revert to the giver,
and his heirs. Next, of land given in free mar|riage,
which implies a condition, that if the hu&s;|band
and wife die without i&s;&s;ue, the land &s;hall
revert to the giver, and his heirs. And, third,
of land given to a man, and the heirs of his bo|dy,
conditionally, that it &s;hall in like manner re|vert,
failing i&s;&s;ue. It &s;ub&s;umes, that, contrary to
the conditions expre&s;&s;ed or implied in &s;uch grants,
the feoffees had power to alien the land, to the
di&s;appointment, not only of the heirs as to their
right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o of the donor as to
his right of rever&s;ion. Therefore enacts, &startq;That
the will of the donor &s;hall from henceforth be
ob&s;erved; &s;o that the donees &s;hall have no
power to alien the land, but that it &s;hall re|main
to the i&s;&s;ue cho&s;en in the deed; and when
they fail, &s;hall revert to the donor, or his
heirs.&endq; This &s;tatute, in a &s;tyle very different
from the pre&s;ent mode, is laconic, but not the
le&s;s per&s;picuous, as it leaves no doubt about the
intention of the legi&s;lature. It re&s;embles, how|ever,
not a little, the will of a de&s;potic prince:
it pronounces a <HI>fiat,</HI> but deigns not to pre&s;cribe
the means for making the <HI>fiat</HI> effectual. It is
left to judges and to men learned in the law, to
contrive means the be&s;t they can. From the
whole tenor of the act, it appears, that the land
<PB N="336" REF="351">
is under&s;tood to be conveyed to the donee; and
accordingly all writers agree, that the donee is
re&s;trained from aliening, not from defect of right,
but by force of the &s;tatute; con&s;equently, that
his deed of alienation is not void, but only void|able
as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the &s;tatute. They fur|ther
agree, that the debts of the donee are not
effectual, more than his alienations, again&s;t his
heirs, nor again&s;t the donor. And la&s;tly, it is
held in general, that every act by which the will
of the donor can be di&s;appointed, is barred by
the &s;tatute, not even excepting high trea&s;on.
The&s;e inferences are derived, all of them, from
the declared will of the legi&s;lature: &startq;Ordering,
That the will of the donor be ob&s;erved; and
that the land &s;hall remain to the i&s;&s;ue cho&s;en
in the deed; and when they fail, &s;hall revert to
the donor, or his heirs.&endq; The donor accor|dingly
is, by Engli&s;h writers, &s;aid to have an e|&s;tate
in the land, which is a fee-&s;imple on ex|pectancy.
The donee, commonly called <HI>tenant
in tail,</HI> is &s;aid to have another e&s;tate in the land,
termed an <HI>e&s;tate-tail;</HI> which is an e&s;tate of inhe|ritance,
i. e. an e&s;tate that de&s;cends to heirs, but
which his debts and deeds cannot affect, more
than if he were a naked liferenter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Coke, 2d in&s;t. p. 335.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Did the property remain with the donor, this
&s;tatute would be conformable to the &s;tricte&s;t prin|ciples
<PB N="337" REF="352">
of the Feudal law; for, as ob&s;erved above,
no deed done by a va&s;&s;al can hurt the &s;uperior.
But the fact which the &s;tatute has in view, is a
grant of the land to the donee; which ve&s;ts the
property in him, and re&s;erves nothing to the do|nor
but a rever&s;ion. Such a rever&s;ion, which is
founded on a covenant merely, and has no lien
on the land, or, as we expre&s;s it, is not a real
right, does not bar the donee from aliening the
land; and con&s;equently, is not at common law
effectual again&s;t a purcha&s;er. It binds indeed
the donee and his heirs, by virtue of the cove|nant;
but it binds none who are not parties in
the covenant. The &s;tatute however declares it
effectual again&s;t all the world, in &s;pite of prin|ciples;
and the &s;tatute mu&s;t be obeyed. The
commerce of land is thus rendered extremely ha|zardous;
for, after the utmo&s;t precaution, a
purcha&s;er of land mu&s;t for ever remain uncertain,
whether the vender may not have been bar|red
by an entail from aliening. Such ob&s;truc|tion
to commerce, we have the charity to believe,
was not early fore&s;een. While an entail is re|cent,
it mu&s;t be produced by the vender as his
title for aliening: but after a family has been
long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, perhaps a century or two, it
will not readily enter into the thoughts of a pur|cha&s;er
to demand a title &s;o far back. Engli&s;h
entails became a public nui&s;ance; and the cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="338" REF="353">
mentioned, contributed probably more
than any other to their downfal.</P>
<P>A bolder attack on the principles of ju&s;tice, e|ven
the mo&s;t &s;acred, is not to be found in the
laws of any country;&mdash;the tran&s;actions of credi|tors
and purcha&s;ers, upon which their bread may
depend, trampled under foot; and &s;acrificed, not
to the living &s;olely, but to heirs coming into ex|i&s;tence
perhaps a thou&s;and years after. If a land|holder
mu&s;t be humoured in rendering his e&s;tate
a &s;ort of mortmain, why not put an indelible mark
upon it? Why not publi&s;h to the world, Here
lies a &s;nake, touch it not? This metaphorical
&s;nake, more poi&s;onous than any that really exi&s;t,
is not provided even with a rattle to warn pa&s;|&s;engers.
Such violent encroachments on ju&s;tice,
confound legal principles, and reduce law to be
a chaos. Legal principles ought to be held &s;a|cred
by the legi&s;lature, as well as by individuals,
never to be infringed upon any account whate|ver.
But the thirteenth century was a period of
gro&s;s ignorance through all Europe, the northern
parts e&s;pecially; and in tho&s;e dark times, prin|ciples,
whether of religion, law, or morality,
were very little under&s;tood. Nor is the &s;tatute
under con&s;ideration &s;ingular in that re&s;pect.
There is a &s;imilar in&s;tance in Scotland; and ma|ny
&s;uch may be found in the laws of every coun|try.
Where a man &s;ells land, and takes the
purcha&s;er bound, upon receiving back the price,
<PB N="339" REF="354">
to re&s;tore the land to him, &s;uch an obligation,
which is merely per&s;onal, cannot bar the pur|cha&s;er
from aliening the land for a valuable con&s;i|deration;
though it may &s;ubject him to damages
for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing his obligation. Yet the act 27.
of our parliament 1469, declares, &startq;That the re|ver&s;ion
provided to the di&s;poner &s;hall be effec|tual
to him again&s;t all &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, e|qually
as again&s;t the granter of the rever&s;ion.&endq;
Neither nece&s;&s;ity nor utility are here urged: the
act is put entirely upon law and con&s;cience. How
cloudy mu&s;t have been the notions of our lawgi|vers
at that period, not to perceive that both law
and con&s;cience are deeply wounded by this act;
e&s;pecially as no provi&s;ion is made for publi&s;hing
&s;uch a rever&s;ion, more than for publi&s;hing an
Engli&s;h entail?</P>
<P>The curious reader, before he enter upon the
act 1685, will not be &s;atisfied with an account of
Engli&s;h entails, but will wi&s;h to be made ac|quainted
al&s;o with entails made in Scotland up|on
the foundation of common law, prior to the
act 1685. By our common law, the property of
land ve&s;ts in the heir upon completing his title
by infeftment; which impowers him to alien, to
contract debt, and to exerci&s;e every other act of
property. Now, to bar an heir infeft from ex|erci&s;ing
&s;uch acts, prohibitive and irritant clau|&s;es
are the only means known at common
<PB N="340" REF="355">
law<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">From Bacon's hi&s;tory of the nature, u&s;e, and pro|ceedings of the law of England, &s;ect. 4. par. 13. we learn, that what are called perpetuities were introduced into England, after the invention of docking an entail by a fine and recovery. The&s;e perpetuities were &s;up|ported by clau&s;es prohibitory and re&s;olutive, preci&s;ely as our entails are. And it is likely, that the form of our entails was borrowed from the Engli&s;h perpetuities.</NOTE>; and yet that they are ineffectual, is de|mon&s;trated
in Hi&s;torical Law-tracts<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tract 3.</NOTE>. A man
may bind his heirs, by prohibiting them to alien,
or contract debt; but he cannot prohibit one to
purcha&s;e from his heir, or to lend money to him,
becau&s;e a purcha&s;er or creditor is not &s;ubjected
to his authority. A penalty annexed to the pro|hibition,
&s;uch as a forfeiture of the heir's right,
will affect him; and upon a declarator of irri|tancy,
will deprive him of the e&s;tate. And yet,
as he continues proprietor till a decree be pro|nounced
in the declarator, his alienations mu&s;t
be effectual, as well as debts contracted by him.
Thus, an entailed e&s;tate is protected again&s;t the
deeds of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as one is again&s;t being
robbed or murdered: the terror of puni&s;hment
is in both ca&s;es the only protection. If a tenant
in tail boldly ri&s;k a forfeiture, he can put an end
to the firme&s;t entail that can be made at common
law.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="356">
We are now prepared for the act 1685, the
&s;ubject of the pre&s;ent article. The act is no le&s;s
perplexed than ob&s;cure: it expre&s;&s;es an intention
to make entails effectual; but that intention is
the only thing which is clearly expre&s;&s;ed. Such
a &s;tatute re&s;embles an ancient oracle: the dark|er,
the more revered. Singularly unlucky it is
for this nation, that the ob&s;curity of this &s;tatute,
has led our judges, to extend entails beyond
what the words import, and probably beyond
what was intended by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>In commenting upon this &s;tatute, the leading
point is, Upon whom has the &s;tatute be&s;towed
the privilege, of making an entail that &s;hall be
&s;ecure again&s;t creditors and purcha&s;ers? The re|markable
ca&s;e of Stormont<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">26th February 1662, in the fir&s;t volume of Deci|&s;ions collected by Lord Stair.</NOTE> paved the way to
the &s;tatute. The entail upon which the debate
aro&s;e in that ca&s;e, was made by a proprietor in|feft.
At that period, and for a long time after
the &s;tatute, an heir-apparent had no hold of the
land, nor any authority over it; and to think of
his making an entail would have been a gro&s;s ab|&s;urdity.
We may therefore with certainty con|clude,
that no per&s;on was in the eye of the le|gi&s;lature,
but one regularly infeft as proprietor.
And if an heir-apparent be excluded, a di&s;ponee,
who&s;e right is per&s;onal only, cannot be included.
<PB N="342" REF="357">
There is not a &s;ingle clau&s;e in the &s;tatute, that
can be &s;tretched to comprehend either: in eve|ry
clau&s;e it is taken for granted, that the per&s;ons
authori&s;ed to make an entail are infeft in the e|&s;tate;
witne&s;s the following clau&s;e in particular,
&startq;Such tailzies &s;hall only be allowed, in which
the fore&s;aid irritant and re&s;olutive clau&s;es are
in&s;ert in the procuratories of re&s;ignation, char|ters,
precepts, and in&s;truments of &s;ei&s;in.&endq; The
deeds and writs here named imply clearly, that
the maker of an entail mu&s;t be infeft; becau&s;e
&s;uch deeds and writs cannot be made by an heir|apparent,
or by a di&s;ponee.</P>
<P>To have a ju&s;t notion of a &s;tatutory entail,
another point is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to be known;
and that is, the means employed by the &s;tatute to
&s;ecure the e&s;tate again&s;t creditors and purcha&s;ers.
The ca&s;e of Stormont, mentioned above, led the
way to the &s;tatute. The point debated in that
ca&s;e was, Whether an heir infeft is effectually
barred, by prohibitive and irritant clau&s;es, from
aliening, and contracting debt? The affirmative
was decided, upon the following ground, That
prohibitions and irritancies in an entail, ought to
have the &s;ame effect to bar per&s;ons from bar|gaining
with a tenant in tail, that an interdic|tion
has to bar per&s;ons from bargaining with
one interdicted. And upon authority of that
judgement, many entails were made before the
&s;tatute had a being. A prevailing bias for en|tails,
<PB N="343" REF="358">
rendered our judges blind to the principles
of common law concerning property. Doubts
aro&s;e; and the following train of rea&s;oning made
an impre&s;&s;ion. To take advantage of the weak
and facile, is contrary to ju&s;tice and humanity;
and yet it requires an interdiction, which is an
act of &s;overeign authority, to prevent &s;uch ad|vantage
to be taken. Nor is the &s;overeign's au|thority
alone &s;ufficient: the interdiction mu&s;t be
publi&s;hed, to put all on their guard. Now it is
not in the power of the &s;overeign, to protect an
e&s;tate again&s;t creditors and purcha&s;ers; and if
&s;o, how can it be imagined, that a private pro|prietor
&s;hould have &s;uch a power; e&s;pecially
without publi&s;hing his deed of entail<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See this point more fully handled in Hi&s;torical Law-tracts, tract 3.</NOTE>? The
legi&s;lature, &s;en&s;ible that the argument from in|terdiction
is inconclu&s;ive, made the act 1685, in
order to be&s;tow upon entails the force of an in|terdiction.
The words are, &startq;It is &s;tatuted and
declared, That it &s;hall be lawful to his Maje|&s;ty's
&s;ubjects to tailzie their lands, to &s;ub&s;titute
heirs in their tailzies, with &s;uch provi&s;ions and
conditions as they &s;hall think fit, and to affect
the &s;aids tailzies with irritant and re&s;olutive
clau&s;es; whereby it &s;hall not be lawful to the
heirs of tailzie to &s;ell, contract debt, or do
any other deed, whereby the &s;ame may be ad|judged
<PB N="344" REF="359">
or evicted from the &s;ub&s;titutes, or the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion fru&s;trate or interrupted. And his
Maje&s;ty declares the&s;e clau&s;es to be real and
effectual, not only again&s;t the contraveners
and their heirs, but al&s;o again&s;t their credi|tors-adjudgers,
and other &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;&s;ors,
whether by legal or conventional titles.&endq; Thus,
by force of the &s;tatute, prohibitive and irritant
clau&s;es are made effectual, to bar people from
purcha&s;ing from a tenant in tail, or from lending
him money, as they are barred from purcha&s;ing
or lending to a per&s;on interdicted. But as ju|&s;tice
requires, that an entail be publi&s;hed, as well
as an interdiction, in order to put all men on
their guard, the greate&s;t anxiety is &s;hown to have
it publi&s;hed in &s;uch a manner as to leave no per|&s;on
in ignorance. In the fir&s;t place, it mu&s;t be
ingro&s;&s;ed in every writ nece&s;&s;ary for infeftment.
In the next place, the original tailzie mu&s;t judi|cially
be produced before the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion,
who are ordained to interpo&s;e their authority
thereto. In the third place, the tailzie mu&s;t be
recorded in a regi&s;ter-book kept for that purpo&s;e.
And there is a fourth provi&s;ion, which &s;hows &s;till
more clearly, that publication is what is chiefly
relied on for making an entail effectual. The
provi&s;ion is, &startq;That the prohibitory and irritant
clau&s;es mu&s;t be repeated in the rights and con|veyances
of the heirs of tailzie by which they
bruik or enjoy the e&s;tate.&endq; And it is decla|red,
<PB N="345" REF="360">
&startq;That if the&s;e clau&s;es be omitted in the
heir's infeftment, creditors, and other &s;ingu|lar
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors who contract with him <HI>bona fide,</HI>
&s;hall be &s;ecure.&endq; Our legi&s;lature acted wi&s;ely
in requiring the&s;e various notifications. They
had been taught by experience, that the ingro&s;&s;|ing
the clau&s;es in the original infeftment of en|tail,
is far from being &s;ufficient. Such an infeft|ment
may have been executed a century back;
and as time advances, becomes more and more
di&s;tant. But even where recent, every per&s;on has
not acce&s;s to it: a man agreeing to lend a great
&s;um on heritable &s;ecurity, may boldly call for the
title-deeds: but a &s;hopkeeper mu&s;t not di&s;oblige
his cu&s;tomers; and ought therefore to have &s;ome
means more public for di&s;covering whether he be
in &s;afety to deal with them.</P>
<P>The nature and extent of the &s;ecurity afforded
to entails by the &s;tatute 1685, will be clearly un|der&s;tood,
upon con&s;idering, that it makes no al|teration
in our common law with re&s;pect to the
tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of land-property. The e&s;tate de|&s;cends
from the entailer to the heirs named in the
deed of entail; and each heir connects with his
predece&s;&s;or by a &s;pecial &s;ervice and infeftment,
preci&s;ely as where there is no entail. And to e|vince,
that the property is completely ve&s;ted in
each heir, we have the authority of the &s;tatute
it&s;elf; which, taking that propo&s;ition for grant|ed,
employs prohibitive and irritant clau&s;es to
<PB N="346" REF="361">
bar alienation. Such clau&s;es would be &s;uper|fluous
and ab&s;urd, were a tenant in tail &s;o limited
from the nature of his right, as to make it <HI>ultra
vires</HI> in him to alien, or contract debt: they
would re&s;emble a prohibition to walk on the &s;ea,
or to vi&s;it the inhabitants of the moon. In the
&s;ub&s;equent ob&s;ervations, this propo&s;ition will be
taken for granted as fundamental. It was not
thought advi&s;eable to make any alteration in the
nature or tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of land-property; and the
only means left for &s;ecuring entails, were prohi|bitions
and forfeitures. A tenant in tail is &s;ub|jected,
by his own con&s;ent, to the prohibitive
and irritant clau&s;es: he accepts of the e&s;tate un|der
the&s;e conditions. All others are &s;ubjected by
the &s;tatute, di&s;charging them to lend money to a
tenant in tail, or to purcha&s;e his land. Hence,
no deed done contrary to the&s;e prohibitions, is
available in law: with re&s;pect to the tenant in
tail, it is voidable as a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of his en|gagement;
and with re&s;pect both to him and to
the per&s;on he contracts with, it is voidable as a
contempt of legal authority.</P>
<P>Next in order come the e&s;&s;ential &s;olemnities of
an entail, &s;uch as intitle it to the privileges of
the &s;tatute 1685. I enquire, in the fir&s;t place,
whether it be nece&s;&s;ary to a &s;tatutory entail that
infeftment pa&s;s on it. That point is determined
by a clau&s;e mentioned above, &startq;That &s;uch tail|zies
&s;hall only be allowed, in which the irri|tant
<PB N="347" REF="362">
and re&s;olutive clau&s;es are in&s;ert in the pro|curatories
of re&s;ignation, charters, precepts
and in&s;truments of &s;ei&s;in.&endq; Therefore an en|tail
cannot have the privileges of the &s;tatute, un|le&s;s
it be engro&s;&s;ed in a procuratory of re&s;ignation,
in the charter granted by the &s;uperior in pur|&s;uance
of that procuratory, in the precept of &s;ei&s;in,
and in the in&s;trument of &s;ei&s;in<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">As by act 7. parl. 1672, it is enjoined, that the pre|cept of &s;ei&s;in be in&s;erted at the end of every charter from the crown; I do not readily &s;ee why the irritant and re&s;olutive clau&s;es &s;hould be twice ingro&s;&s;ed in every &s;uch charter. Did our legi&s;lature overlook the &s;aid act 1672? However this be, one thing is clear, that an entail can have no &s;upport from the act 1685, unle&s;s the irritant and re&s;olutive clau&s;es be ingro&s;&s;ed in the precept of &s;ei&s;in, as well as in the procuratory of re&s;ignation, in the charter, and in the in&s;trument of &s;ei&s;in. Upon in|&s;pection of the record, it will be found, that this &s;olem|nity has not always been completely fulfilled.</NOTE>. As an entail
deviates far from common law, and has no foun|dation
in equity, it mu&s;t be executed preci&s;ely as
the &s;tatute directs, otherwi&s;e it is not a &s;tatutory
entail. Therefore a deed of entail left by the
entailer without completing it by infeftment, is
not a &s;tatutory entail. Holding &s;trictly to the
&s;tatute, I cannot admit, that an entail ingro&s;&s;ed in
a di&s;po&s;ition of land to be held of the granter, is
a &s;tatutory entail, even though it be completed
by infeftment. There is no mention of &s;uch an
entail in the &s;tatute; and &s;uppo&s;ing it to have
<PB N="348" REF="363">
been omitted by over&s;ight, which however can|not
be made evident, a court, whether of law
or of equity, is not impowered to &s;upply the
defect. The fir&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;olemnity then of an
entail that is intitled to the privileges of the &s;ta|tute,
is, that it be ingro&s;&s;ed in a new &s;ettle|ment
of the e&s;tate, completed by a procuratory
of re&s;ignation, a charter from the &s;uperior, and
&s;ei&s;in upon it. A &s;econd e&s;&s;ential &s;olemnity is,
that the authority of the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion be given
to the entail. And a third, that it be recorded
in the regi&s;ter of tailzies. The&s;e three particu|lars
are united in the &s;tatute, which enacts,
&startq;That &s;uch tailzies only &s;hall be allowed (i. e.
have the privileges of the &s;tatute) where the
fore&s;aid irritant and re&s;olutive clau&s;es are in|&s;ert
in the procuratories of re&s;ignation, char|ters,
precepts, and in&s;truments of &s;ei&s;in; and
where the original tailzie is produced before
the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, and recorded in a parti|cular
regi&s;ter.&endq; Without any of the&s;e &s;olem|nities,
an entail may be effectual to regulate
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of heirs, and to regulate every o|ther
point that depends on common law: but
unle&s;s the&s;e &s;olemnities, all of them, be adhibi|ted,
an entail can draw no &s;upport from the act
1685, more than it can draw from the act 1681,
where it wants the name of the writer, or de&s;ig|nation
of the witne&s;&s;es. The three &s;olemnities
mentioned mu&s;t be performed in their order.
<PB N="349" REF="364">
The clau&s;es of the entail mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t place,
be ingro&s;&s;ed in the infeftmemt. The entail mu&s;t
next be produced before the Lords of Se&s;&s;ion
for their approbation. And the final &s;tep is, to
record it in the regi&s;ter of tailzies. If a deed of
entail, without infeftment, be produced in the
court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, the judges are not bound to in|terpo&s;e
their authority: nay they cannot interpo&s;e,
without contradicting the &s;tatute, which expre&s;sly
enacts, that a tailzie &s;hall not be allowed, unle&s;s
the irritant and re&s;olutive clau&s;es be ingro&s;&s;ed in
the infeftment. And if an entail be pre&s;ented to
the regi&s;ter, without authority of the court of
&s;e&s;&s;ion, the clerk-regi&s;ter and his deputes ought
not to record it.</P>
<P>Upon the plan of the &s;tatute it follows, that no
per&s;on is intitled to produce an entail before the
court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, in order to have it recorded, but
the maker him&s;elf, or his heir infeft, who, were
there need for it, could make it <HI>de novo.</HI> Any
one of the &s;ub&s;titutes is indeed intitled to have
the entail recorded for pre&s;ervation; but it is the
right of the maker only, or of his heir infeft, to
complete the entail, by adhibiting the &s;olemni|ties
required by the &s;tatute. This is obvious with
re&s;pect to the &s;olemnity of in&s;erting in the infeft|ment
the prohibitive and irritant clau&s;es; which
depends entirely on the will of the per&s;on who
makes the entail: he is not bound to make an
entail; nor, after taking &s;ome &s;teps, is he bound
<PB N="350" REF="365">
to complete it: he may throw it iuto the fire if
he plea&s;e. And with re&s;pect to every one of the
&s;olemnities, a deed of entail, as a <HI>corpus</HI> or
moveable, follows the land, and appertains to the
heir infeft, who has the &s;ame power over it that
the maker had. No &s;ub&s;titute is intitled to pro|duce
it in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, or to record it in
the regi&s;ter of entails. Suppo&s;e a man leaves his
te&s;tament imperfect, &s;ub&s;cribed by him&s;elf, but not
by the witne&s;&s;es. After his death, a legatee ap|plies
to the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, praying their autho|rity
to make the witne&s;&s;es &s;ub&s;cribe, in order to
validate the te&s;tament. Would the court li&s;ten
to this prayer? Certainly not. No per&s;on is in|titled
to complete a deed but the maker, or his
heir who has right to it by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This holds
in a te&s;tament, and it mu&s;t equally hold in a deed
of entail.</P>
<P>View the matter in a different light. The
maker of an entail is not bound to adhibit the
&s;tatutory &s;olemnities, nor con&s;equently his heir.
If &s;o, no action can be &s;u&s;tained at the in&s;tance of
a &s;ub&s;titute, either again&s;t the maker, or his heir,
to oblige them to complete the entail. Now &s;up|po&s;ing
the deed of entail to fall accidentally in|to
the hands of a &s;ub&s;titute, can his accidental
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion give him any right over it that he had
not formerly? So far from acquiring any new
right, he is bound to deliver it to the per&s;on to
<PB N="351" REF="366">
whom it belongs; and can, if he refu&s;e, be com|pelled
by an action of exhibition.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be urged for a &s;ub&s;titute, That
a man who makes a deed of entail, &s;urely intends
to make it effectual; otherwi&s;e why &s;o many an|xious
clau&s;es <HI>de non alienando, et non contra|hendo
debitum?</HI> and that the heir ought to
obey the will of his predece&s;&s;or. It is obvious
to an&s;wer, fir&s;t, That nothing is more common
than change of mind: a man probably, at the
time of making an entail, intends to complete it;
but if he &s;top &s;hort, and leave it in its imperfect
&s;tate till he dies, may not change of mind be
ju&s;tly inferred? An&s;wered, next, The heir is
not bound to &s;upply any defect in his predece&s;|&s;or's
deed, unle&s;s he be taken bound by an ex|pre&s;s
clau&s;e &s;o to do. And &s;uppo&s;ing an inten|tion
in the predece&s;&s;or to have his will completed,
a court of equity will indeed lay hold of inten|tion,
where ju&s;tice requires their interpo&s;ition;
but no court will give force to pre&s;umed intention,
in order to deprive a man of his birthright, by
&s;ubjecting him to the fetters of an entail.</P>
<P>The following que&s;tion ari&s;es from what is now
&s;aid. An entail is left by the maker complete
in every point, except as to recording: Are the
tutors of his infant-heir bound to apply for ha|ving
it recorded in the regi&s;ter of entails? It
would be an act directly again&s;t the intere&s;t of
their pupil; and con&s;equently incon&s;i&s;tent with
<PB N="352" REF="367">
their duty. And it would be unju&s;t in the court
of &s;e&s;&s;ion to countenance the application.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing now an entail to be complete in all
its &s;olemnities; the great points to be con&s;ider|ed
are, What are the effects of it; Again&s;t
what heirs it operates; and, Again&s;t what deeds.
Of the&s;e in their order. The Engli&s;h &s;tatute en|ables
a proprietor to withdraw his e&s;tate from
commerce, and to &s;ecure it entire to the heirs
of entail. Our &s;tatute is very different. What
gave ri&s;e to it, as mentioned above, is the re|markable
ca&s;e of Stormont, in which the debate
was, Whether an heir infeft can be barred by
prohibitive and irritant clau&s;es from aliening and
contracting debt. The court gave their opinion
for the affirmative; but as that opinion had
no foundation at common law, the &s;tatute was
made, enabling proprietors to fetter their heirs
infeft, beyond what can be done at common law.
The prohibitions accordingly and irritancies of
the &s;tatute, regard none but heirs of entail infeft,
and tho&s;e who contract with them. Ob&s;erve, fir&s;t,
that the&s;e clau&s;es are directed again&s;t heirs who can
&s;ell the e&s;tate; and no heir has that power but who
is infeft. Ob&s;erve, next, the clau&s;e intitling the
&s;ub&s;titute who obtains a declarator of irritancy,
to &s;erve to a remoter predece&s;&s;or infeft, pa&s;&s;ing
by the contravener. Here evidently the contra|vening
heir is under&s;tood to be infeft: for &s;urely
it requires not a &s;tatute to enable the &s;ub&s;titute
<PB N="353" REF="368">
to pa&s;s by an heir not infeft: nay, he mu&s;t pa&s;s
by him, as there is no &s;uch thing in law as &s;er|ving
to an heir-apparent. Scrutinize the &s;tatute
from beginning to end, there is not a &s;ingle
word in it to create even a &s;u&s;picion that any heirs
were in view but heirs infeft, and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.
Debts contracted by a &s;ub&s;titute were not in
view; nor is there any provi&s;ion again&s;t &s;uch
debts. Nay more, I &s;ay affirmatively, that &s;uch
debts were intended not to be prohibited; which
is evident from the following clau&s;e: &startq;That
creditors, and other &s;ingular &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;hall
be &s;ecure who contract <HI>bona fide</HI> with the per|&s;on
&s;tanding infeft in the e&s;tate, unle&s;s the ir|ritant
and re&s;olutive clau&s;es be in the body of
his right.&endq; Here it is declared lawful to lend
money knowingly to an heir of entail, though
the entail be on record, if the re&s;olutive and ir|ritant
clau&s;es be omitted in the heir's infeftment.
It could not therefore be the intention of the le|gi&s;lature,
to forfeit a man who lends money to a
&s;ub&s;titute in an entail, even though he know
him to be a &s;ub&s;titute; and le&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible, where
he lends money <HI>bona fide</HI> without knowing his
debtor to be a &s;ub&s;titute. An ab&s;urdity &s;o gro&s;s
is not &s;uppo&s;eable. A merchant turns bankrupt
after borrowing from me a thou&s;and pounds.
He &s;ucceeds to an entailed e&s;tate by the death
of many intervening &s;ub&s;titutes; and I lay hold
of that opportunity to adjudge the e&s;tate on a
<PB N="354" REF="369">
charge again&s;t him to enter heir. An act of in|ju&s;tice
&s;o flagrant as to cut down my adjudication
without any wrong on my part, could not be in|tended.
And with re&s;pect to the &s;ub&s;titute, my
debtor, what crime has he committed? A &s;ub|&s;titute
is a free man; nor is even an heir-appa|rent
&s;ubjected to the provi&s;ions of an entail, till
he enter, and be infeft: before that &s;tep be ta|ken,
he is as free and independent as the remo|te&s;t
&s;ub&s;titute. At the &s;ame time, his declining
to enter, will not protect the e&s;tate from his cre|ditors,
more than if it were a fee-&s;imple: their
adjudications on a charge to enter mu&s;t be effec|tual.
Nor will his entering heir hurt his credi|tors.
The &s;tatute prohibits not any per&s;on to
lend money to a &s;ub&s;titute in an entail; and a
debt once lawfully contracted, cannot be cut
down by the debtor's chu&s;ing to enter heir. No
entail can be contrived to prevent that con&s;e|quence.
A clau&s;e, it is true, may be contrived,
excluding from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion every heir who is
in debt. Such a clau&s;e may be effectual again&s;t
the heir; but it will not hurt his creditors,
who are not prohibited, either by the &s;tatute or
at common law, to adjudge the e&s;tate for their
payment.</P>
<P>Thus, every heir-apparent is left free, by the
&s;tatute, to annihilate the firme&s;t entail that can
be devi&s;ed. In&s;tead of entering, he contracts
debt: his creditors acquire right to the e&s;tate
<PB N="355" REF="370">
by adjudication; and he has got the value in
money. Nor can I admit this to be a defect in
the &s;tatute. It was a great &s;tretch in our legi&s;la|ture,
to indulge a few individuals, again&s;t the
common intere&s;t, to bar their heirs infeft from a|liening,
or contracting debt. It would have been
a &s;till greater &s;tretch, and al&s;o more hurtful to
the commerce of land, to bar every one of a
long train of &s;ub&s;titutes from making &s;uch tran&s;|actions.
Our legi&s;lature mu&s;t have been &s;hort|&s;ighted
indeed, to have overlooked this particu|lar;
and if it was under deliberation, their &s;i|lence
is a demon&s;tration that they had no inten|tion
to bar any deeds but tho&s;e of the heir infeft.</P>
<P>The only doubt that can ari&s;e upon this point,
is, Whether an heir-apparent who &s;uffers the en|tailed
e&s;tate to be adjudged for debt contracted
by him&s;elf, be not accountable to the &s;ub&s;titutes
for the money he received, con&s;idered as the
price of the e&s;tate. This doubt is ea&s;ily remo|ved.
A &s;ub&s;titute has no claim to the e&s;tate,
nor con&s;equently to the price, while the heir-ap|parent
is alive: nor, after the death of the heir|apparent,
can his repre&s;entatives or executors be
made liable; becau&s;e the money received by
him was borrowed money, and cannot be reckon|ed
the price of an e&s;tate that never belonged to
him. If it be urged, That the heir-apparent
ought to be &s;ubjected to damages, for permit|ting
the entailed e&s;tate to be carried off by his
<PB N="356" REF="371">
creditors; I an&s;wer, That a claim of damages
&s;uppo&s;es a wrong done which ought to be repair|ed;
and I &s;ee not that a man commits any wrong
in borrowing money, though he happens to be a
&s;ub&s;titute in an entail. A tentant in tail, who,
by forbearing to in&s;ert in his infeftment the pro|hibitory
and irritant clau&s;es, lays the e&s;tate open
to his creditors, is guilty of a wrong in neglect|ing
what he is enjoined to do by the deed of en|tail;
and that wrong intitles the &s;ub&s;titutes to
reparation. But an heir-apparent is not bound
by the entail; and therefore is not guilty of any
wrong in contracting debt, and &s;uffering the e|&s;tate
to be attached by his creditors.</P>
<P>So much as to the per&s;ons who are &s;ubjected
by the &s;tatute to the provi&s;ions of an entail. We
next take under con&s;ideration what debts and
deeds are prohibited. The ob&s;curity of the &s;ta|tute
may occa&s;ion a doubt, what prohibitions
are made effectual again&s;t &s;trangers, whether e|very
prohibition that can be devi&s;ed by an en|tailer,
or only the prohibitions of purcha&s;ing, and
lending money. A landholder, without needing
the aid of a &s;tatute, can fetter his heirs at his
plea&s;ure: they cannot &s;tand in oppo&s;ition; be|cau&s;e
they inherit the e&s;tate on condition of ful|filling
his will. But no prohibition, except what
is authori&s;ed by the &s;tatute, can be effectual a|gain&s;t
tho&s;e who repre&s;ent him not. Now, when
the &s;tatute is examined with the mo&s;t critical eye,
<PB N="357" REF="372">
there is not found in it any prohibition again&s;t
&s;trangers, but that of lending money to a tenant
in tail, and that of purcha&s;ing land from him.
If it be urged, That it &s;eems intended by the &s;ta|tute,
to make effectual again&s;t all the world eve|ry
provi&s;ion that can be invented by an entailer;
it is an&s;wered, fir&s;t, That &s;uch intention cannot
be gathered from the &s;tatute, not even by the
mo&s;t di&s;tant implication: and, next, That &s;up|po&s;ing
the intention to be implied; yet, in a
matter repugnant to utility, as well as to the
principles of property, equity authori&s;es not jud|ges
to &s;upply any defect, whether of words or of
intention. Thus it appears, that &s;trangers, in
bargaining with a tenant in tail, are &s;ubjected to
no prohibition but of lending money, and pur|cha&s;ing
land. They can &s;traight marches with
him; and land may be exchanged for the bene|fit
of both e&s;tates: &s;uch deeds only are prohibi|ted
by the &s;tatute as are hurtful to the entailed
e&s;tate, not what are beneficial<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">By the act 10^0 Geo. III. cap. 51. a tenant in tail is permitted to exchange land with a neighbour, to the extent of thirty acres; which indeed &s;uppo&s;es, that the exchanging land is barred by the act 1685. But an erroneous &s;uppo&s;ition, though in an act of parlia|ment, does not overturn law. It cannot be overturned but by a po&s;itive enactment.</NOTE>. Churli&s;h en|tailers
put their heirs under a prohibition of grant|ing
long lea&s;es, though no le&s;s prejudicial to the
<PB N="358" REF="373">
heirs, and even to the e&s;tate, than to the public.
But there is no authority in the &s;tatute for &s;uch
a prohibition: a lea&s;e is not a &s;ale; nor can it
be made the ground of an adjudication for evict|ing
the e&s;tate. An entailer may prohibit his heir
from granting a long lea&s;e; but that bars not
the le&s;&s;ee, over whom he has no power. The
le&s;&s;ee is indeed acce&s;&s;ory to the wrong done by
the le&s;&s;or, in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing a prohibition in the en|tail;
but &s;uch wrongs, which are not criminal
<HI>&s;ua natura,</HI> operate not again&s;t acce&s;&s;ories<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See before, article 3. how far a challenge again&s;t the author is effectual again&s;t the per&s;on who acquires from him.</NOTE>.
I would not however be under&s;tood, to plead
for a lea&s;e beyond what is nece&s;&s;ary for promo|ting
indu&s;try and improvements, a lea&s;e, for ex|ample,
of two or three nineteen years. A lea&s;e
of ninety or a hundred years may ju&s;tly be held
a &s;pecies of alienation, to fall under the &s;tatuto|ry
prohibition. A lea&s;e of a moderate endurance
for an elu&s;ory rent, will not fall under that pro|hibition:
but it will be reducible at common
law; becau&s;e the &s;lighte&s;t wrong by a tenant in
tail, will affect &s;uch acce&s;&s;ories as are <HI>in lucro
captando.</HI> Neither is a liferent-locality to a
bride in her contract of marriage prohibited by
the &s;tatute: it is not a loan; it is not a purcha&s;e
of any part of the property; and an adjudication
cannot proceed upon it. The &s;ame holds with
<PB N="359" REF="374">
re&s;pect to an annuity for life; provided it be
granted under a condition, that the annuitant
&s;hall not be intitled to adjudge for payment of
arrears.</P>
<P>Taking it now for granted, that no act nor
deed is prohibited by the &s;tatute, but what tends
directly or indirectly to carry off land from the
heirs of entail; the next inquiry is, Whether all
acts and deeds by which land may be carried off
from the&s;e heirs, are prohibited by the &s;tatute.
In pro&s;ecution of this inquiry, I begin with con|&s;idering,
that as the means employed in the &s;ta|tute
for &s;ecuring entails, are prohibitive and ir|ritant
clau&s;es, it clearly follows, that if there be
any debts or deeds that cannot fall under a pro|hibition,
the&s;e mu&s;t have their effect at common
law; for they are not barred by the &s;tatute.
Whether there be any debts or deeds of that
kind, will appear from the nature of a prohibi|tion.
An order requiring any per&s;on to perform
a certain act, or to forbear performing, &s;uppo&s;es
that per&s;on to be a voluntary agent: to order a
man to jump over a mountain, or to re&s;train his
pul&s;e from beating, is an ab&s;urdity. Voluntary
acts may be prohibited; but there is not a &s;ingle
word in the &s;tatute, that points at &s;uch an ab&s;ur|dity
as the prohibiting involuntary acts. So far
from it, that feu-duties, and other ca&s;ualties of
&s;uperiority, which are involuntary with re&s;pect
to every heir of entail, are declared to be effec|tual.
<PB N="360" REF="375">
And there are debts and deeds of various
kinds that cannot fall under a prohibition, as be|ing
altogether involuntary with re&s;pect to the
claimant. A merchant who bargains for ready
money, and is di&s;appointed of his payment, is
not guilty of contemning the authority of the &s;ta|tute:
he lent no &s;um to the tenant in tail, nor
intended to give him tru&s;t. The hands of a te|nant
in tail are not tied up from doing mi&s;chief:
if he burn my hou&s;e, or rob me of my goods,
he is &s;ubjected to reparation, without my fault on
my part; and his e&s;tate mu&s;t be liable, as well
as his per&s;on: it would be gro&s;s inju&s;tice to pro|tect
the e&s;tate again&s;t &s;uch a claim. A tenant
in tail grants a lea&s;e to me; but breaks his en|gagement,
and puts another in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. With|out
any fault on my part, or any breach of legal
authority, I become his creditor for a great &s;um
of damages. A tenant in tail is required by a
neighbouring heritor to concur in erecting a
march-fence: he fails; and a decree pa&s;&s;es a|gain&s;t
him for fifty or &s;ixty pounds. A tenant in
tail has levied the rents, &s;tock, and teind, near
forty years: the titular obtains a decree again&s;t
him for a large &s;um as the value of the teind.
Debts of the nature mentioned, being altogether
involuntary on the creditor's part, mu&s;t be ef|fectual
again&s;t the &s;tricte&s;t entail. The terce and
courte&s;y, being founded on the law of the land,
are not voluntary deeds to be brought under
<PB N="361" REF="376">
a prohibition. A &s;tipend to a mini&s;ter, a &s;alary
to a &s;choolma&s;ter, wages to a &s;ervant, an account
due to an apothecary, to an agent, and a thou|&s;and
&s;uch, were certainly not intended to be pro|hibited
by the &s;tatute; and con&s;equently will be
effectual again&s;t the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Worldly-minded men, who are fonder of their
e&s;tates than of their heirs, will be apt to think,
that it was the intention of the legi&s;lature, though
not expre&s;&s;ed, to &s;ecure an entailed e&s;tate again&s;t
claims of every kind; and that it is incumbent
on a court of equity to enforce the intention of
the legi&s;lature, whether expre&s;&s;ed or implied.
But, in the fir&s;t place, the&s;e gentlemen have no
encouragement from the &s;tatute, to &s;ay that
more was intended but to prohibit purcha&s;ing
and lending money; e&s;pecially as it would be
gro&s;sly unju&s;t to forfeit involuntary debts, where
there is no contempt of authority. Such gro&s;s
inju&s;tice, it is true, may be the fruit of the Eng|li&s;h
&s;tatute, which declares in general, that the
will of the donor &s;hall be ob&s;erved, and that the
land &s;hall remain to the i&s;&s;ue cho&s;en in the deed.
But that &s;tatute, the production of an ignorant
age, was not copied by us; nor will ever be
copied in any civilized country. In the next
place, &s;uppo&s;ing more to have been intended by
the legi&s;lature than expre&s;&s;ed, yet equity will not
permit a judge to give force to any implied inten|tion
that is productive of inju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="377">
Having &s;aid what occurred upon debts, we
proceed to purcha&s;es. And here another rule
occurs, founded on the very nature of a prohi|bition.
To make a prohibition effectual, it is not
alone &s;ufficient that the deed prohibited be vo|luntary:
it is nece&s;&s;ary that it be al&s;o known to
the party who tran&s;gre&s;&s;es it; for without know|ledge,
there can be no contempt of authority.
This requires explanation. A purcha&s;e from one
who has no right, is void, whether the purcha&s;er
be <HI>in bona</HI> or <HI>mala fide;</HI> becau&s;e a conveyance
from one who has no right, can give no right to
the acquirer. But I have had more than one oc|ca&s;ion
to mention, that a tenant in tail in Scot|land,
has the property of the e&s;tate completely
ve&s;ted in him; and con&s;equently, that if he be
barred from aliening, the re&s;traint ari&s;es, not
from defect of right, but from the &s;tatutory pro|hibition.
It follows, as will appear more fully
afterward, that a &s;ale by a tenant in tail tran&s;|fers
the property to a purcha&s;er; and that
the prohibitive clau&s;e can only found a re|duction
again&s;t the purcha&s;er, the re&s;ult of which
is, to deprive him of his right, as a puni&s;h|ment
for his contempt of legal authority. But if
the purcha&s;er happen to be ignorant that the &s;ub|ject
is entailed, he acts <HI>bona fide,</HI> and cannot
be reached by a reduction; for it is an inviolable
rule of law, That a man cannot be deprived of
his property again&s;t his con&s;ent, unle&s;s as a pu|ni&s;hment
<PB N="363" REF="378">
for wrong done by him. Now, a pur|cha&s;e
may be made <HI>bona fide</HI> from a tenant in
tail, though the entail has been publi&s;hed accor|ding
to the injunctions of the &s;tatute. In record|ing
an entail, all that the &s;tatute requires, is a
general de&s;ignation of the lord&s;hips and baronies.
The particular farms have names that enter not the
record; be&s;ide that farms are every day &s;plit into
parts, and moulded into different farms with new
names. I purcha&s;e one of the&s;e farms from a te|nant
in tail, having no &s;u&s;picion that it makes a
part of the entailed e&s;tate. The property is fair|ly
transferred to me; and I cannot be reached
by a reduction, becau&s;e though I have tran&s;gre&s;&s;|ed
the prohibition by purcha&s;ing, yet as the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion
is innocent, I have not been guilty of
contemning the &s;tatute. I put another ca&s;e &s;till
more clear. After po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this new farm &s;ome
years without challenge, a purcha&s;er from me is
undoubtedly &s;ecure; for if a purcha&s;e from a
tenant in tail who has neglected to in&s;ert in his
infeftment the prohibitive and irritant clau&s;es, be
lawful, though known by the purcha&s;er to be
part of the entailed e&s;tate; a purcha&s;e from me,
who have no entailed e&s;tate, is <HI>a fortiori</HI> lawful.
I make a bolder &s;uppo&s;ition, that a man, pur|cha&s;ing
knowingly from a tenant in tail, lies o|pen
to a reduction as a contemner of the &s;tatute.
Having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed years without challenge, he di&s;|po&s;es
of the &s;ubject for a valuable con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="379">
I affirm, that the &s;econd purcha&s;er is &s;ecure, e|ven
&s;uppo&s;ing him to have known that the &s;ub|ject
was entailed. There is no prohibition in the
&s;tatute but again&s;t that per&s;on only who purcha|&s;es
from a tenant in tail; and there is no <HI>labes
realis</HI> in that purcha&s;e to operate again&s;t &s;ingular
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors without end. This ca&s;e I acknowledge
comes under the &s;pirit of the &s;tatute, and pro|bably
would have been guarded again&s;t, had it
been fore&s;een; but in points that affect proper|ty
and run cro&s;s to common law, a <HI>ca&s;us omi&s;|&s;us</HI>
cannot be &s;upplied by any court. The ca&s;e
here &s;uppo&s;ed, is analogous to a reduction <HI>ex ca|pite
inhibitionis.</HI> A man who purcha&s;es from a
per&s;on inhibited, is &s;ubjected to that reduction;
but the reduction reaches not tho&s;e who derive
right from that man.</P>
<P>We proceed to con&s;ider, whether a &s;tatutory
entail be &s;ecure again&s;t a fine or a forfeiture in|flicted
on a tenant in tail. With re&s;pect to a fine,
the point is not intricate: it mu&s;t be effectual a|gain&s;t
the e&s;tate; becau&s;e there can be no fine
but by an act of parliament, or by the decree of
a court; and therefore is none of the acts or
deeds that are prohibited; in which re&s;pect, it
re&s;embles a claim of damages mentioned above.
The &s;tatute accordingly declares, &startq;That a fine
&s;hall not import a contravention of the irritant
clau&s;e,&endq; i. e. &s;hall not be held to be a deed
prohibited by the &s;tatute.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="380">
Whether an entailed e&s;tate be &s;ecure again&s;t
forfeiture for high trea&s;on, is a que&s;tion that
made a figure in the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion, and al&s;o in
the Hou&s;e of Lords. It was held to be a &s;ubtile
que&s;tion, and puzzled the mo&s;t learned in our
law; and yet, by a ju&s;t analy&s;is of our act 1685,
it may be reduced to a very &s;imple point. If a
tenant in tail be proprietor, which is undoubted,
the forfeiture of his lands for high trea&s;on is a
nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, as much as a forfeiture of
his moveables. The &s;tatutory prohibitions are
directed again&s;t voluntary deeds only, purcha&s;ing
from a tenant in tail, and lending him money.
The King, to whom the forfeiture accrues, has
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed neither of the&s;e prohibitions; and
therefore the &s;tatute does not militate again&s;t
him. And we have the be&s;t authority to &s;upport
this argument: it is declared in the &s;tatute it&s;elf,
&startq;That nothing in this act &s;hall prejudice his
Maje&s;ty as to confi&s;cations and fines.&endq; Whence
it appears, that the &s;ecurity afforded by act 33.
parl. 1690, to &s;ub&s;titutes again&s;t the forfeiture of
a tenant in tail, is a privilege which they are not
intitled to from the nature of a Scotch entail.
This privilege is indeed con&s;idered in the act as
a matter of ju&s;tice merely; but our legi&s;lature
was mi&s;led by a maxim applicable to an Engli&s;h
entail only, That a man ought not to forfeit by
his crime, what he cannot alien by his will. A
man who&s;e right be&s;tows on him no power of a|lienation,
<PB N="366" REF="381">
cannot alien either by his will or by
his crime. But a man who has the property ab|&s;olutely
ve&s;ted in him, can alien; and while he
remains proprietor, his e&s;tate may be affected by
adjudication; which will &s;tand effectual, provided
it proceed upon claims that are not prohibited by
the act 1685.</P>
<P>Upon the union of the two kingdoms, the pro|tection
again&s;t forfeiture given to &s;ub&s;titutes by
act 1690, was withdrawn; in order to make the
puni&s;hment of trea&s;on the &s;ame in both king|doms.
Engli&s;h entails are in their nature &s;ecure
again&s;t forfeiture; &startq;which,&endq; &s;ays Lord Bacon,
&startq;made the owners le&s;s fearful to commit mur|ders,
felonies, trea&s;on; for that they knew
none of the&s;e acts could hurt the heir of his in|heritance<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">U&s;e of the law, ch. On property.</NOTE>.&endq; To this evil a remedy was pro|vided
by 26^o Henry VIII. cap. 13. having the fol|lowing
preamble: &startq;And to the intent that all
trea&s;on &s;hould be the more dreaded, hated,
and dete&s;ted to be done, by any per&s;on or per|&s;ons;
and al&s;o becau&s;e it is a great boldne&s;s,
and an occa&s;ion to ill-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons to ad|venture,
and embrace their malicious intents
and enterpri&s;es, which all true &s;ubjects ought
to &s;tudy to e&s;chew.&endq; Therefore enacting,
&startq;That &s;uch offender &s;hall forfeit all &s;uch lands,
tenements, and hereditaments, which he &s;hall
<PB N="367" REF="382">
have of any e&s;tate of inheritance in u&s;e or
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, by any right, title, or means.&endq; By
force of this &s;tatute, the trea&s;on of a tenant in
tail, not only forfeits his own right, but al&s;o the
expectancy of his heirs; becau&s;e an e&s;tate-tail is
an e&s;tate of inheritance. But remainder-men,
who are not heirs, but conditional in&s;titutes, are
not hurt by the &s;tatute: they are under&s;tood to
have an e&s;tate in the land &s;eparate and di&s;tinct
from that of the forfeiting per&s;on and his heirs.</P>
<P>So &s;tands the law of England; and in order
that the &s;ame acts might be trea&s;on in both coun|tries,
and receive the &s;ame puni&s;hment, the act
7^o Anne, cap. 20. was made, enacting, &startq;That
&s;uch crimes and offences as are high trea&s;on,
or mi&s;pri&s;ion of high trea&s;on, in England, and
none others, &s;hall, after the fir&s;t of July 1709,
be high trea&s;on and mi&s;pri&s;ion of high trea&s;on
in Scotland; and that all per&s;ons convicted or
attainted of high trea&s;on, or mi&s;pri&s;ion of high
trea&s;on, in Scotland, &s;hall be &s;ubject and liable
to the &s;ame corruption of blood, pains, pe|nalties,
and forfeitures, with per&s;ons convict|ed
or attainted of the&s;e crimes in England:
excepting heirs of entail committing trea&s;on
before the &s;aid time, and married, who &s;hall
forfeit for them&s;elves only, and not for the
i&s;&s;ue of the marriage, being heirs of entail.&endq;
In order to make the trea&s;on-laws the &s;ame in
both kingdoms, it was no &s;tretch, to forfeit land
<PB N="368" REF="383">
entailed in Scotland. An Engli&s;h entail is, in
its nature, &s;ecure again&s;t forfeiture; and yet is
&s;ubjected to forfeiture by the act above mention|ed
of Henry VIII. A Scotch entail affords no &s;e|curity
again&s;t forfeiture; and to declare this to
be law, was no hard&s;hip. In repealing our act
1690, the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature made no wider &s;tep
than to deprive heirs of entail of a privilege that
had been conferred on them beyond the nature
of their right.</P>
<P>But in making the act 7~0 of the Queen, it was
not adverted to, that forfeiture mu&s;t have a more
exten&s;ive effect again&s;t a Scotch entail, than by
the &s;tatute of Henry VIII. it hath again&s;t an en|tail
in England. There, forfeiture operates only
again&s;t the criminal and his heirs, not again&s;t re|mainder-men.
But as in Scotch &s;ettlements, e|very
per&s;on called to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is an heir;
the trea&s;on of a tenant in tail in Scotland, mu&s;t
de&s;troy the entail, root and branch. This ine|quality
was perceived by the Hou&s;e of Lords,
and rectified by a judgement given on an appeal
from the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion. The ca&s;e was this.
Sir James Gordon of Park, <HI>anno</HI> 1713, execu|ted
a procuratory for re&s;igning his barony of
Park into the hands of his &s;uperior, for new in|feftment
to him&s;elf, and after his decea&s;e, to
William Gordon his elde&s;t &s;on, and the heirs|male

with divers other &s;ub&s;titutions. The u&s;ual pro|hibitory
and irritant clau&s;es are ingro&s;&s;ed, and
particularly an irritant clau&s;e upon committing
trea&s;on. A charter from the crown and &s;ei&s;in
proceeded upon this procuratory, in which the&s;e
clau&s;es were al&s;o ingro&s;&s;ed. Upon the death of
Sir James, William his elde&s;t &s;on &s;ucceeded.
He was forfeited for his acce&s;&s;ion to the rebellion
1745; and the e&s;tate was &s;eized for behoof of the
crown. As Sir William at that time had no
children, the e&s;tate was claimed by his brother
Captain John Gordon, as the next heir of entail.
It was judged here, &startq;That Sir William Gor|don,
the per&s;on attainted, being by the entail
di&s;abled from aliening the e&s;tate, charging the
&s;ame with debt, or altering the cour&s;e of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
in prejudice of the claimant and the o|ther
heirs of tailzie, or from otherwi&s;e hurt|ing
or impairing their right to the &s;aid e&s;tate
after his death; therefore the barony of Park
is, by Sir William's attainder, forfeited, to
the crown during his life only; and that after
his decea&s;e, John Gordon, the claimant, hath
right to the &s;aid barony.&endq; But the Hou&s;e of
Lords, on an appeal, were clear to rever&s;e this
decree, and to find, That the e&s;tate, as forfeited,
did remain with the crown as long as any i&s;&s;ue|male
&s;hould exi&s;t of Sir William's body. At the
&s;ame time, it was con&s;idered, that according to
<PB N="370" REF="385">
the tenor of the &s;ettlement, Captain Gordon
would, by the law of England, not be an heir
of entail to his brother Sir William, but a re|mainder-man,
having a &s;eparate e&s;tate in the
land, conditionally on the extinction of Sir Wil|liam
and his i&s;&s;ue-male; therefore &startq;it was ad|judged

<P>By this judgement a <HI>r&euml;mainder</HI> with re&s;pect to
forfeiture is introduced into our law, hitherto un|known
in Scotland. We mu&s;t not however ima|gine,
that this judgement proceeded from igno|rance
of the law of Scotland. The innovation
was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to make a perfect equali|ty
between the two nations, with re&s;pect to the
puni&s;hment of trea&s;on. A remainder-man in
England is not hurt by the trea&s;on of the tenant
in tail; and in order to communicate that privi|lege
to Scotland, it was nece&s;&s;ary to hold Cap|tain
Gordon to be a remainder-man. It cannot
but be acceptable to the reader to hear the emi|nent
lawyer who pre&s;ided in the Hou&s;e of Lords
at that time, giving his rea&s;ons in &s;upport of the
judgement. The&s;e are contained in a letter with
which he honoured the author of the&s;e Elucida|tions;
and a copy of the letter, as far as relative
to the judgement, is added at the end; together
with a copy of Lord Chief Baron Parker's argu|ment
with re&s;pect to this ca&s;e; and the judge|ment
of the Hou&s;e of Lords upon it.</P>
<P>It has been much controverted, whether in
the act 1685 prior entails be comprehended.
Had it been the opinion of the legi&s;lature, that
<PB N="372" REF="387">
entails are &s;ecure at common law, they certainly
would not have thought a &s;tatute nece&s;&s;ary for &s;e|curing
an entailed e&s;tate again&s;t creditors and
purcha&s;ers. Now, &s;uppo&s;ing it to have been the
opinion of the legi&s;lature, that debts contracted
by a tenant in tail before 1685 were effectual a|gain&s;t
his e&s;tate, it would have been gro&s;sly un|ju&s;t
to withdraw from the creditors the chief fund
of payment, perhaps the only fund. The legi&s;|lature
could never intend to forfeit innocent cre|ditors,
who lent their money on the faith that an
entail was no bar to their payment: every law|yer
would have told them, that they were &s;ecure.
Hence it may fairly be concluded, that prior en|tails
were left to &s;tand or fall by their own merit;
and that there was no intention, in making the
act 1685, to wound creditors and purcha&s;ers at
that time exi&s;ting. There is accordingly not a
&s;ingle retro&s;pective clau&s;e in the &s;tatute. It is
declared only, &startq;That it &s;hall be lawful to tailzie
lands and e&s;tates,&endq; i. e. lawful in time coming.
I do not rigidly in&s;i&s;t, that an entail, to have the
benefit of the &s;tatute, mu&s;t be framed after it.
The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion probably would make no
difficulty to interpo&s;e their authority to an entail
dated before the 1685, provided the prohibitive
and irritant clau&s;es be ingro&s;&s;ed in the infeft|ment;
and would &s;u&s;tain that entail upon being
recorded, as effectual by the &s;tatute; &s;aving al|ways
debts contracted and purcha&s;es made be|fore
<PB N="373" REF="388">
recording. And this &s;eems to have been
the &s;en&s;e of the Hou&s;e of Lords, in an appeal
between the Earl of Rothes and his creditors, de|claring,
that entails prior to the 1685 ought to
be recorded according to the &s;tatute<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">16th January 1761.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From general views we de&s;cend to the irritan|cies
of the &s;tatute. In an entail before the 1685,
irritancies were nece&s;&s;ary; becau&s;e a prohibition
by a man again&s;t his heir, avails not at common
law, unle&s;s a penalty be annexed. But in a &s;ta|tutory
entail, I &s;ee no nece&s;&s;ity or expedience for
irritating the right of a tenant in tail who aliens
or contracts debt, when without it the legal pro|hibition
is effectual again&s;t all the world. For|feitures
without nece&s;&s;ity or expedience, are
highly repugnant to the mild laws that ought to
govern a free people; and therefore highly ab|&s;urd.
An alienation by a debtor inhibited, pro|duces
no forfeiture: it is only declared ineffec|tual
again&s;t the inhibiter. An alienation by a te|nant
in tail, is equally ineffectual again&s;t his &s;ub|&s;titutes.
To afford them over and above a de|clarator
of irritancy, is to favour an heir, who is
<HI>in lucro captando,</HI> more than an inhibiting cre|ditor,
who is <HI>in damno vitando.</HI> Had this con&s;i|deration
occurred to the legi&s;lature, no counte|nance,
I am per&s;uaded, would have been given
to &s;uch an irritancy. But in the entails at that
<PB N="374" REF="389">
time exi&s;ting, irritancies were common, becau&s;e
they were nece&s;&s;ary; and our legi&s;lature inad|vertently
authori&s;ed them without nece&s;&s;ity. It
de&s;erves con&s;ideration, whether &s;uch irritancies
ought to have any &s;upport from the court of &s;e&s;|&s;ion:
equity declares &s;trongly again&s;t them.
May it not rationally be urged, That here the
words of the &s;tatute reach inadvertently beyond
intention, and that action ought not to be &s;u&s;tain|ed
on words without intention?</P>
<P>There is one clau&s;e in the &s;tatute that de|&s;erves
particular animadver&s;ion. The words are,
&startq;Which provi&s;ions and irritant clau&s;es &s;hall be
repeated in all the &s;ub&s;equent conveyances of
the &s;aid tailzied e&s;tate to any of the heirs of
tailzie; declaring, that the omi&s;&s;ion &s;hall im|port
a contravention of the irritant and re&s;o|lutive
clau&s;es again&s;t the per&s;on and his heirs
who &s;hall omit to in&s;ert the &s;ame; but &s;hall
not militate again&s;t creditors and other &s;ingu|lar
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who have contracted <HI>bona fide</HI>
with the per&s;on infeft without the &s;aid irritant
and re&s;olutive clau&s;es in the body of his right.&endq;
A contravention or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a prohibition,
is intelligible; but what &s;en&s;e is there in a con|travention
or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of an irritant or re&s;olu|tive
clau&s;e? I have no excu&s;e for &s;uch jargon,
but that the &s;word has always been a greater fa|vourite
with my countrymen than the pen. A|gain,
the omi&s;&s;ion, it is &s;aid, &s;hall not militate a|gain&s;t
<PB N="375" REF="390">
creditors, &amp;c. Did it require a &s;tatute to
protect creditors again&s;t the omi&s;&s;ion of a tenant
in tail? Can an omi&s;&s;ion have any effect except
again&s;t the per&s;on who is guilty of it, or again&s;t
his repre&s;entatives? One who favours entails,
will probably attempt to cut a Gordian knot that
he cannot untie: neglecting the words, he will
give a meaning to the clau&s;e, &s;uch as he thinks
it ought to have, that the omi&s;&s;ion &s;hall be a for|feiture
of the heir's right to the e&s;tate. But &s;up|po&s;ing
this to be the meaning, will judges of e|quity
take upon them to enforce a penalty
or forfeiture that is not expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ta|tute?
And if judges cannot interpo&s;e, here is
another &s;afe method for defeating an entail: cre|ditors
and purcha&s;ers are &s;ecure, if the irritancies
be not ingro&s;&s;ed in the infeftment; and the in|tended
irritancy of the heir's right for his omi&s;|&s;ion,
cannot be made effectual by a court of e|quity;
which, in a matter of puni&s;hment, will
not venture to &s;upply any defect in words. This
clau&s;e &s;ugge&s;ts another doubt. It is enacted, or
&s;uppo&s;ed to be enacted, That the heir who ne|glects
to ingro&s;s the irritant clau&s;es in his infeft|ment,
&s;hall forfeit for him&s;elf and his heirs.
What heirs? The words import his heirs of en|tail;
and yet this &s;en&s;e would put an end to the
entail altogether, which &s;urely was not intended.
But it avails not to examine critically a blunder|ing
clau&s;e. Nothing el&s;e probably was intended,
<PB N="376" REF="391">
but to compel every heir to ingro&s;s in his infeft|ment
the prohibitive and irritant clau&s;es, by ma|king
the omi&s;&s;ion a cau&s;e for forfeiting him and
the heirs of his body.</P>
<P>The clau&s;e under con&s;ideration is fruitful of
doubts. Is the irritancy mentioned in it effectual
by force of the &s;tatute, though not contained in
the entail? The words &s;eem to favour the affir|mative;
but are oppo&s;ed by the following con&s;i|deration,
That it is not the intendment of the &s;ta|tute
to make an entail, but only to make entails
effectual <HI>&s;ecundum formam doni,</HI> or according
to the intention of the entailer. A man who, af|ter
the date of the &s;tatute, makes an entail, knows,
that to &s;ecure the e&s;tate again&s;t creditors and
purcha&s;ers, the prohibitive and irritant clau&s;es
mu&s;t be ingro&s;&s;ed in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive title-deeds.
He ought to provide accordingly by proper clau|&s;es;
for if the&s;e be omitted, the pre&s;umption is,
that he intended to leave his heirs free. The
be&s;t interpreters of will are a man's actions: if
he do the thing, he mu&s;t have willed it; if he
leave it undone, he probably did not will it. Let
it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that an entailer expre&s;sly relieves
his heirs from that &s;olemnity: it will not be
thought, that the &s;tatutory irritancy mu&s;t not|with&s;tanding
take effect; and does he not virtual|ly
declare his heirs to be free, when he does not
bind them to u&s;e the &s;olemnity? The &s;tatute
therefore is not to be under&s;tood literally, as re|quiring
<PB N="377" REF="392">
quiring the heir under an irritancy to engro&s;s in
his infeftment the irritant and re&s;olutive clau&s;es;
but only as declaring, that if that &s;olemnity be o|mitted,
the ential &s;hall not be effectual again&s;t
creditors or purcha&s;ers; leaving to entailers at
their plea&s;ure to enjoin that &s;olemnity or not.
Hence it may be held as undoubted law, that
the clau&s;e in que&s;tion was contrived for the &s;afe|ty
of creditors and purcha&s;ers, not for benefiting
the &s;ub&s;titutes.</P>
<P>Viewing the irritancies enacted in the &s;tatute, a
declarator with re&s;pect to &s;ome is made nece&s;&s;ary:
others are appointed to take effect <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> with|out
a declarator. But &s;uch difference of expre&s;|&s;ion
in a &s;tatute eminently defective in compo&s;i|tion,
ought not to be regarded; for the &s;pirit of
the &s;tatute requires a declarator in every ca&s;e.
The irritancy again&s;t the heir for omitting in his
infeftment the prohibitive and irritant clau&s;es, is
declared &startq;to have the effect of an <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> de|volution
of the e&s;tate to the next heir of en|tail.&endq;
Let any man who is fond of this &s;ta|tute
&s;ay, whether &s;uch devolution be con&s;i&s;tent
with what is declared in the &s;ame clau&s;e, viz.
That purcha&s;ers and creditors &s;hall be &s;ecure.
To make the e&s;tate devolve <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> on the
next heir, is, in other words, to forfeit the heir
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the moment he takes infeftment
without ingro&s;&s;ing the prohibitive and irritant
clau&s;es, and to annul his right to the e&s;tate. At
<PB N="378" REF="393">
that rate, every &s;ale he makes is void, as flowing
<HI>a non habente pote&s;tatem:</HI> nor can his creditors
affect the entailed e&s;tate, which belongs not now
to him. How then can purcha&s;ers and creditors
be &s;ecure? It is a glaring incon&s;i&s;tency in the &s;ta|tute
to make the devolution take place <HI>ip&s;o fac|to</HI>
without a declarator. Till that declarator be
obtained, the heir continues proprietor; and his
deeds mu&s;t operate again&s;t the e&s;tate, as declared
in the &s;tatute.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See this &s;ubject more fully handled, Principles of E|quity, edit. 2. p. 152.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Taking it now for granted, that a declarator
is nece&s;&s;ary in every ca&s;e, the que&s;tion is, to
whom is it competent; whether to every &s;ub&s;ti|tute,
or to the immediate &s;ub&s;titute only. A de|clarator
for annulling debts and deeds of a tenant
in tail, is by the &s;tatute given to the immediate
&s;ub&s;titute, without mentioning any other. But
in this in&s;tance, the words of the &s;tatute are &s;hort
of the intendment. Every &s;ub&s;titute is intere&s;ted
to have the e&s;tate purged of &s;uch debts and
deeds as are prohibited by the entail; and an ac|tion
ought of cour&s;e to have been afforded to eve|ry
&s;ub&s;titute, for making his intere&s;t effectual.
But as none but the immediate &s;ub&s;titute is men|tioned,
the defect cannot be &s;upplied even by a
court of equity.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, Engli&s;h and Scotch entails
<PB N="379" REF="394">
differ widely from each other. The Engli&s;h &s;ta|tute
has broken through every legal ob&s;truction
to make an entail impregnable. And as the &s;ta|tute
continues in force to this day, Engli&s;h entails
mu&s;t have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted as long as the family, had
not their ruinous con&s;equences encouraged jud|ges
to plot their de&s;truction. Our entails, on the
contrary, are &s;o loo&s;ely guarded, that they may
be attacked with &s;ucce&s;s from &s;everal quarters.
In the next place, Engli&s;h entails give opportu|nity
for the mo&s;t flagrant inju&s;tice, by want of
publication; the omi&s;&s;ion of which admits no ex|cu&s;e.
This defect is amply &s;upplied by our &s;ta|tute:
the notifications required are &s;o many and
various, as to afford little room for pleading ig|norance.
Thirdly, Engli&s;h entails are of one
form, extremely &s;imple. Our entails are ex|tremely
complex, and of very different kinds:
in &s;ome, the heirs are &s;trictly &s;ettered; in others,
le&s;s &s;trictly: &s;ome contain prohibitions without
irritancies; nor has every entail the &s;ame irritan|cies.
The &s;tatute 1685 has left the&s;e differences
to entailers: it is not the purpo&s;e of the &s;tatute,
to make an entail where the proprietor made
none; nor to add fetters to tho&s;e contained in
the entail. Prohibitions again&s;t purcha&s;ers and
creditors bargaining with an heir infeft, are &s;up|ported
by the &s;tatute: there it re&s;ts, and goes
not a &s;ingle &s;tep farther.</P>
<P>In attempting a commentary on a &s;tatute &s;o
<PB N="380" REF="395">
impolitic in its views, &s;o crude in its conceptions,
and &s;o imperfect in its language, it appeared to
me indi&s;pen&s;able to &s;hake off all bias from authori|ty,
and to begin with extracting, if po&s;&s;ible, the
true &s;pirit and purpo&s;e of the &s;tatute; re&s;olving
to take next under con&s;ideration, the opinions of
writers, and the deci&s;ions of our &s;upreme court.
But upon di&s;covering the former to be little a|greeable,
in my apprehen&s;ion, to the &s;pirit of the
&s;tatute, and the latter to be far from uniform; I
&s;topt &s;hort, utterly at a lo&s;s how to proceed.
And now, after a long interval, I have come to
a re&s;olution not to proceed. It afflicts me to va|ry
from mo&s;t re&s;pectable authorities; e&s;pecially
as, in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e, I have little expecta|tion
that my notions will be reli&s;hed. May I
venture only to hint, that from one who pores
days and nights on a &s;ubject, and who finds lei|&s;ure
for general views, a more correct &s;y&s;tem may
be expected, than from the deci&s;ions of a court
con&s;i&s;ting of many members, who mu&s;t attend to
a variety of cau&s;es almo&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant,
without having lei&s;ure to meditate deeply upon
every one; not to mention, that the nice&s;t points
are not always explained to them by the mo&s;t a|cute
pleaders?</P>

<P>&mdash;That you &s;hould conceive &s;ome di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction
at the judgement of the Hou&s;e of Lords,
in the ca&s;e of Gordon of Park, gives me no &s;ur|pri&s;e.
Notwith&s;tanding the part I had in that de|ci&s;ion,
and my thorough conviction of the ju&s;tice
of it, founded upon the mo&s;t mature deliberation,
I always feared that it would be of difficult di|ge&s;tion
with the profe&s;&s;ors of the law of Scotland.
But I cannot &s;ufficiently admire and applaud your
great candour in &s;o readily owning a conver&s;ion,
which does much honour to that judgement, and
will, I doubt not, have great weight in removing
&s;uch doubts as may remain with any of your bre|thren.</P>
<P>That you may the more clearly &s;ee the grounds
whereupon the Hou&s;e of Lords proceeded, I take
the liberty to inclo&s;e a copy of my Lord Chief
Baron Parker's argument in delivering the opi|nion
of the judges in the Hou&s;e of Lords upon
the que&s;tion propo&s;ed to them, together with a
copy of their Lord&s;hips order, taken from the
journal. I found &s;ome difficulty in &s;tating my
que&s;tion, &s;o as to avoid making the Engli&s;h jud|ges
judges of the Scotch law, (which would have
<PB N="382" REF="397">
been highly improper), and &s;imply to refer to
them the main point ari&s;ing upon the con&s;truction
of the act 7^o <HI>Annae.</HI> For this rea&s;on I was for|ced
to frame the que&s;tion hypothetically, and to
in&s;ert two &s;uppo&s;itions of points merely of your
law re&s;erved for the determination of the Hou&s;e,
and which were determined by the opinion of the
Lords, given in the debate, after the judges had
been heard. All the Lords concurred, that by
the law of Scotland, an e&s;tate-tailzie, with prohi|bitive,
irritant, and re&s;olutive clau&s;es, is an e&s;tate
of inheritance; and that by the &s;ame law no e|&s;tate
or intere&s;t in the lands was ve&s;ted in Sir
William Gordon by virtue of the limitation in
the &s;ettlement of 19th October 1713 to the heirs-male
of the body of Sir James Gordon; though
that would have been clearly otherwi&s;e by the
rules of the law of England.</P>
<P>Your di&s;cernment has already &s;hown you, that
by this method, the que&s;tion put to the Engli&s;h
judges was reduced, purely and &s;imply, to the
con&s;truction of a &s;tatute of the parliament of
Great Britain, which it is equally the office of
the King's courts in both parts of the united
kingdom to expound; and every thing that could
make a point in the Scotch law, was kept apart
for the deci&s;ion of the Lords, the proper judges
of it.</P>
<P>To repeat the &s;everal rea&s;ons of the judgement
in the cau&s;e of Park, would &s;well my letter too
<PB N="383" REF="398">
much. But I will ju&s;t fling out to you two or
three ideas, which had weight with me, though
they do not fully appear in the opinion of the
judges.</P>
<P>1. My foundation was the expre&s;s declaration
of the legi&s;lature in the preamble of the act
7^o <HI>Annae,</HI> which is the ba&s;is of the &s;ub&s;equent en|acting
clau&s;e, &startq;That nothing can more conduce
to the improving the union of the two king|doms,
than that the laws of both parts of
Great Britain &s;hould agree <HI>as near as may be,</HI>
e&s;pecially tho&s;e laws which relate to high trea|&s;on,
and the proceedings thereupon, as to
the nature of the crime, the method of pro|ceeding
and trial, <HI>and al&s;o the forfeitures
and puni&s;hment for that offence,</HI> which are
of the greate&s;t concern both to the crown and
to the &s;ubjects.&endq;</P>
<P>2. The enacting clau&s;e relative to this &s;ubject,
is penned in words &s;till more general; and there|fore
the que&s;tion mu&s;t be a que&s;tion of con&s;truc|tion
and expo&s;ition; wherein, though the provi|&s;o
immediately following cannot extend or &s;uper-add
to the enacting clau&s;e, it mu&s;t be allowed
to explain and illu&s;trate and meaning of the
words.</P>
<P>3. That judges are obliged to make that con|&s;truction
which will be&s;t attain the declared in|tent
of the legi&s;lators, provided the words of the
law will bear it; and therefore that &s;uch a con|&s;truction
<PB N="384" REF="399">
as would produce the greate&s;t equality
between England and Scotland in forfeitures for
trea&s;on, mu&s;t be the true con&s;truction.</P>
<P>4. In this I felt the force of the difficulty ari|&s;ing
from the difference between the nature of
your &s;trict Scotch tailzies with &s;ub&s;titutions, and
our Engli&s;h entails with remainders over, which
you have &s;o clearly explained, viz. That in the
former every per&s;on called to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is
con&s;idered as an heir, and has the fee in him;
in the latter, the fee or e&s;tate in the land is bro|ken
and divided into di&s;tinct parts. But then I
con&s;idered what was to be allowed as the con&s;e|quence
of this diver&s;ity between the two laws.
Was a tenant in tail, although admitted to have
an e&s;tate of inheritance de&s;cendible to his i&s;&s;ue,
to forfeit only for his life? Or was every tenant
in tail, by rea&s;on of being inve&s;ted in the ideal
fee, to forfeit not only for him&s;elf and his i&s;&s;ue,
but al&s;o for all the &s;ub&s;titutes?</P>
<P>Either of the&s;e would plainly de&s;troy the equa|lity
in forfeitures profe&s;&s;ed to be e&s;tabli&s;hed by
the legi&s;lature, and not only contradict the in|tent
of the act, but al&s;o the expre&s;s words of the
preamble.</P>
<P>The knot lay here:&mdash;To avoid forfeiting the
whole fee; for as your law places that fee in e|very
tenant in tail, and don't admit of a divi&s;ion
of it into particular e&s;tates and remainders, there
was more colour from legal rea&s;oning to carry it
<PB N="385" REF="400">
to <HI>that large extent,</HI> than to make a man who
had a fee in him, to forfeit for his life only.</P>
<P>But I could not &s;atisfy my own mind, that this
<HI>large extent</HI> was either agreeable to the inten|tion
of the legi&s;lature, or a ju&s;t and equitable mea|&s;ure
between the two nations.</P>
<P>5. How was this to be avoided? By expound|ing
the act by <HI>analogy;</HI> and if you will apply
your u&s;ual penetration to this point, you will
find, that there is often no other po&s;&s;ible way of
making a con&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;ible con&s;truction upon
&s;tatutes conceived in <HI>general words,</HI> which are
to have their operation upon the re&s;pective laws
of two countries, the rules and forms whereof
are different.</P>
<P>The&s;e general words will probably always be
taken from the language or &s;tyle of one of the&s;e
countries more than from the other, and not
corre&s;pond equally with the genius or terms of
both laws. You mu&s;t then, as in other &s;ciences,
rea&s;on by <HI>analogy,</HI> or leave at lea&s;t one half of
the &s;tatute without effect.</P>
<P>This head of argument from <HI>analogy</HI> is not
unknown in the law of England. It was long
&s;ince e&s;tabli&s;hed, upon the &s;tatute, <HI>De donis con|ditionalibus,</HI>
13^o Ed. I. which enacts, That a
fine levied by tenant in tail &s;hall be <HI>ip&s;o jure
nullus.</HI> Stronger words could not be found, in
the conci&s;e words of tho&s;e ancient laws, to ren|der
&s;uch a fine an ab&s;olute nullity. But what &s;aid
<PB N="386" REF="401">
the judges when they came to con&s;true this act?
They &s;aid, it &s;hould be con&s;trued by the rea&s;on
of the common law, (i. e. by <HI>analogy</HI> to that
law): That the que&s;tion was, to create a di&s;abili|ty
in &s;ome per&s;ons to alien to the prejudice of o|thers,
and the common law took notice of &s;uch
di&s;abilities; and for that rea&s;on a tenant in tail
ought to be ranked with eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;ons &s;ei|&s;ed
in right of their wives, who, by the common
law, were di&s;abled to alien to the prejudice of
their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors or their wives: That therefore
the fine &s;hould not be a nullity, and merely void;
but &s;hould work a di&s;continuance, take away the
entry of the i&s;&s;ue, and drive him to his proper
action to recover the land.</P>
<P>There are other in&s;tances of the like nature
in our law. But I am aware, that to the&s;e it may
be objected, That it was rea&s;oning by <HI>analogy</HI>
from one part of the law of England to another
part of the law of the &s;ame country, which is
not the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. I think that doth not
weaken the weight of the example; but I will
put a nearer ca&s;e. In our Engli&s;h courts, wills
have frequently come in que&s;tion, either made
by foreigners, or in parts beyond the &s;eas, rela|ting
to property proper in England, and expre&s;&s;ed
in the language and terms of the law of &s;ome fo|reign
country. In con&s;truing &s;uch wills, the
con&s;tant method has been, fir&s;t, to enquire and
<PB N="387" REF="402">
&s;ettle what would be the operation and effect of
the&s;e terms according to the law of that country
from which the terms are taken; and, then, to
allow them the like effect here, as near as the
law of England will admit. It has &s;eldom hap|pened,
that this could be done preci&s;ely and &s;pe|cifically.
Some &s;uch difference has often appear|ed
as exi&s;ts in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, between our re|mainders
and your &s;ub&s;titutions; but the court
has always allowed the&s;e terms their force and
effect, as near as might be, in &s;upport of right,
<HI>ut res magis valeat quam pereat.</HI></P>
<P>The rules of con&s;truction upon acts of parlia|ment,
are, in many re&s;pects, the &s;ame with tho&s;e
upon wills; and by the con&s;truction made in the
ca&s;e of <HI>Park,</HI> the words of the preamble of the
act 7^o <HI>Annae,</HI> which is the key to the meaning
of the legi&s;lators, are &s;trictly complied with, viz.
&startq;That the laws of both parts of Great Britain
&s;hould (<HI>as to forfeitures for trea&s;on</HI>) agree
as near as may be.&endq; And the world mu&s;t al|low,
that the favourable &s;ide for Scotland was
cho&s;en.</P>
<P>But though by this deci&s;ion the like force is
given to &s;uch &s;ub&s;titutions in your tailzies as to
Engli&s;h remainders, yet they are by no means
turned into remainders to any other purpo&s;e, but
are to be governed by the rules of the law of
Scotland to every others effect; and therefore you
expre&s;s your&s;elf with &s;trict propriety when you
<PB N="388" REF="403">
&s;ay, that <HI>by this judgement a remainder is in|troduced
into our law with re&s;pect to forfei|ture
only.</HI></P>
<P>As to the general mi&s;chief of your &s;trict en|tails,
and the evil con&s;equences of locking up
the land of a country <HI>extra commercium,</HI> I have
long been convinced of them, and rejoice to find
a per&s;on of your knowledge and experience in
the law and con&s;titution of Scotland in the &s;ame
way of thinking. It gives me the better hopes,
that it will not be long before &s;ome proper re|medy
is applied; but the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of that &s;ub|ject,
being political as well as legal, would add
too much to the tediou&s;ne&s;s of a letter which
already &s;tands in need of great excu&s;e. I am, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT common law, e&s;tates in fee-&s;imple, whe|ther
ab&s;olute or conditional, were forfeit|ed
for trea&s;on.</P>
<P>By the &s;tatute of the 13th Ed. I. (commonly
called the &s;tatute <HI>De donis</HI>), the forfeiture of
<PB N="389" REF="404">
lands entailed, even in ca&s;e of trea&s;on, was taken
away; the rea&s;on of which will be be&s;t collected
from the words of the &s;tatute.</P>
<P>&startq;Quod voluntas donatoris, &s;ecundum formam
in charta doni &s;ui, de cetero ob&s;ervetur; ita
quod non habeant illi, quibus tenementum &s;ic
fuerit datum &s;ub conditione, pote&s;tatem alie|nandi
tenementum &s;ic datum, quo minus ad
exitum illorum quibus tenementum &s;ic fuerit
datum, remaneat po&s;t eorum obitum, vel ad
donatorem, vel ad ejus heredem, (&s;i exitus de|ficiat),
revertatur.&endq;</P>
<P>Therefore, my Lords, the will of the donor,
according to the form expre&s;&s;ed in the deed
of gift, was to be ob&s;erved; &s;o that they to
whom the land was given under &s;uch conditions,
&s;hould have no power to alien it, but that it
&s;hould remain to their i&s;&s;ue after their death,
or &s;hould revert to the donor for want of i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>By the expre&s;s words of the &s;tatute they could
not alien, by con&s;truction they could not forfeit
or charge; and the expre&s;s and con&s;tructive re|&s;traints
&s;tood upon one and the &s;ame rea&s;on,
which was, That either alienation, forfeiture,
or charge, was incon&s;i&s;tent with, and would
have defeated the provi&s;ion and intent of the &s;ta|tute.</P>
<P>And the rea&s;on given by the coun&s;el for the
re&s;pondents in the original appeal, That entailed
lands were not forfeitable for trea&s;on, becau&s;e
<PB N="390" REF="405">
they were unalienable, is not well founded; be|cau&s;e
they were alienable when they were not
forfeitable for trea&s;on.</P>
<P>For notwith&s;tanding the &s;trong words in the
&s;tatute <HI>De donis,</HI> in Taltarum's ca&s;e, in the
12th Ed. IV. an alienation of entailed lands by
a common recovery, obtained judicial allowance,
and has been &s;o practi&s;ed ever &s;ince; and by the
4th Henry VII. they might be aliened by fine
with proclamations; and yet the &s;tatute <HI>De donis</HI>
protected them from forfeiture for trea&s;on, till
the making of the &s;tatute of the 26th Henry VIII.
cap. 13.</P>
<P>By that &s;tatute, lands entailed became forfeited
for trea&s;on, under the&s;e words, <HI>all &s;uch lands,
tenements, and hereditaments, which any &s;uch
offender &s;hall have of any e&s;tate of inheritance;</HI>
and the rea&s;on was, becau&s;e this &s;tatute, being
&s;ub&s;equent to the &s;tatute <HI>De donis,</HI> repealed it
in this ca&s;e: and the con&s;truction, that the&s;e
words &s;hould operate upon entails, was extreme|ly
right, as they otherwi&s;e could have no opera|tion
at all, becau&s;e all other e&s;tates of inheritance
(as I have &s;hown already) were forfeited for trea|&s;on
by the common law.</P>
<P>I will now &s;how your Lord&s;hips, that entailed
lands, though unalienable beyond all que&s;tion,
were yet forfeited to the crown for trea&s;on.</P>
<P>If the King made a gift in tail, &s;aving the re|ver&s;ion
to him&s;elf, the attainder of trea&s;on of
<PB N="391" REF="406">
&s;uch tenant in tail did not bar his i&s;&s;ue; becau&s;e
the &s;tatute of the 34th Henry VIII. cap. 20. en|acts,
That the heir in tail in &s;uch ca&s;e &s;hall
have the lands; any recovery, or any other
thing or things hereafter to be had, done, or
&s;uffered, by or again&s;t &s;uch tenant in tail, to the
contrary notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Which act coming after the 26th Henry VIII.
that gave the forfeiture of lands entailed, was a
repeal of that &s;tatute, and a re&s;titution of the &s;ta|tute
<HI>De donis</HI> in this &s;pecial ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But the &s;tatute of the 5th and 6th Ed. VI.
cap. 11. enacts, That every offender, being law|fully
convicted of any manner of high trea&s;on,
according to the cour&s;e and cu&s;tom of the com|mon
law, &s;hall lo&s;e and forfeit to the King's High|ne&s;s,
his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, all &s;uch lands, te|nements,
and hereditaments, which any &s;uch of|fender
or offenders &s;hall have of any e&s;tate of
inheritance in his own right, in u&s;e or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
within this realm of England, or el&s;ewhere with|in
the King's dominions, at the time of &s;uch
trea&s;on committed, or at any time after.</P>
<P>This act coming after 34th Henry VIII. has
repealed it <HI>pro tanto,</HI> and made lands of the
gift of the crown in tail, &s;ubject to forfeiture for
trea&s;on, as well as other lands entailed.</P>
<P>This has been taken to be law from the time
of making the act; and there is no colour for
the ob&s;ervation made at the bar, That it depend|ed
<PB N="392" REF="407">
&s;ingly on Lord Hales's opinion; though, if
it had done &s;o, the authority would have been
very great.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the mo&s;t material act for your
Lord&s;hips con&s;ideration on this occa&s;ion, the act
of the 7th of Queen Anne, cap. 21. for impro|ving
the union of the two kingdoms.</P>
<P>This act recites the benefit that would accrue
to the united kingdom from the provi&s;ions of it.</P>
<P>Enacts, That &s;uch crimes and offences which
are high trea&s;on or mi&s;pri&s;ion of high trea&s;on
within England, &s;hall be the &s;ame in Scotland,
and no other.</P>
<P>And that offenders &s;hall be indicted and tried
in the &s;ame manner as in England; and that all
per&s;ons convicted or attainted of high trea&s;on or
mi&s;pri&s;ion of high trea&s;on in Scotland, &s;hall be
&s;ubject and liable to the &s;ame corruption of blood,
pains, penalties, and <HI>forfeitures,</HI> as per&s;ons con|victed
or attainted of high trea&s;on, or mi&s;pri&s;ion
of high trea&s;on, in England: Provided always,
that where any per&s;on now is, or &s;hall be before
the 1&s;t of July 1709, &s;ei&s;ed of any lands, &amp;c.
in Scotland of an e&s;tate-tail, that is to &s;ay, an
e&s;tate-tailzie affected with irritant and re&s;olutive
or prohibitive clau&s;es, and is, or before the 1&s;t
day of July &s;hall be married, if any i&s;&s;ue of that
marriage be living, or there be po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch
i&s;&s;ue at the time of the high trea&s;on committed;
that then, and in &s;uch ca&s;e, the &s;aid lands, &amp;c.
<PB N="393" REF="408">
&s;hall not be forfeited upon the attainder of &s;uch
per&s;on for high trea&s;on, but during the life of
the per&s;on &s;o attainted only; &s;o that the i&s;&s;ue and
heirs in tail of &s;uch marriage &s;hall inherit the
&s;ame, the &s;aid attainder notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>This act, by reference, re-enacted, and extend|ed
to Scotland, all the laws of England concern|ing
trea&s;on which were then in force, as &s;trong|ly
and effectually as if they had been tran&s;cri|bed
into the body of it; and as, at the time of
making the act, all e&s;tates of inheritance were
and &s;till are forfeited for trea&s;on, we think, upon
the &s;uppo&s;ition in your que&s;tion, that an e&s;tate-tailzie,
with prohibitive, irritant, and re&s;olutive
clau&s;es, is an e&s;tate of inheritance, and that &s;uch
an e&s;tate of inheritance is forfeited; for otherwi&s;e
the forfeitures in England and Scotland would
not be the &s;ame, though the act expre&s;sly requires
they &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P>But it was objected by the learned coun&s;el for
the re&s;pondent, That by the Scotch act of 1685,
e&s;tates-tailzie, with prohibitive, irritant, and re&s;o|lutive
clau&s;es, were unalienable; and by the
Scotch act of 1690, it is provided, That no for|feiture
&s;hould prejudge the heirs of entail therein
mentioned, provided the right of entail was du|ly
regi&s;tered; from whence it was inferred, that
Sir William Gordon could only forfeit for his life.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, we are humbly of opinion,
that the act 7^o <HI>Annae,</HI> being &s;ub&s;equent to the&s;e
<PB N="394" REF="409">
Scotch acts, has repealed them <HI>pro tanto,</HI> in the
&s;ame manner as the 5th and 6th of Ed. VI. re|pealed
34th Henry VIII. which made lands of
the gift of the crown in tail unalienable; and
that this e&s;tate-tailzie is therefore &s;ubjected to for|feiture,
that the forfeitures throughout the uni|ted
kingdom may be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But it was objected by one of the learned gen|tlemen,
That the third clau&s;e, which gives the for|feiture,
would not have induced a forfeiture of
this e&s;tate-tailzie, without the aid of the provi&s;o;
and that the provi&s;o, which only imports and ex|ception,
ought not to extend the con&s;truction of
the foregoing clau&s;e.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, we are humbly of opinion,
that the clau&s;e which gives the forfeiture, would
have induced a forfeiture of this e&s;tate-tailzie
though the provi&s;o had been omitted out of the
act; and we agree, that the provi&s;o ought not
to extend the con&s;truction of the foregoing
clau&s;e.</P>
<P>But as the provi&s;o is in the act, and the re|&s;pondent's
ca&s;e is not the ca&s;e de&s;cribed in the
provi&s;o, <HI>Exceptio firmat regulam in ca&s;ibus non
exceptis,</HI> and greatly &s;trengthens the con&s;truc|tion
we put upon the act.</P>
<P>As to the rever&s;ion in fee, or clau&s;e of return,
&s;uppo&s;ing that by the law of Scotland it was in
Sir William Gordon at the time of his attainder,
we think that to be &s;o clearly forfeited, that it
<PB N="395" REF="410">
would be wa&s;ting your Lord&s;hips time to attempt
to prove it.</P>
<P>But as to the &s;ub&s;titution or limitation to the
heirs-male of Sir James Gordon, and the inter|mediate
&s;ub&s;titutions or limitations between that
and the rever&s;ion in fee, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition in
your Lord&s;hips que&s;tion, that no e&s;tate or inte|re&s;t
was thereby ve&s;ted in Sir William Gordon,
we are humbly of opinion, that no e&s;tate or in|tere&s;t
derived under any of the&s;e intermediate
&s;ub&s;titutions or limitations is forfeited to the
crown by the attainder of Sir William Gordon;
becau&s;e the &s;ub&s;titutes claim as per&s;ons de&s;cribed,
and their e&s;tate or intere&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ively is to be
con&s;idered as a new acqui&s;ition, which can be no
more forfeited by the attainder of Sir William
Gordon, than a remainder limited after an e&s;tate-tail
in England can be forfeited by the attainder
of the tenant in tail for trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there is a &s;aving in the act of 26th
Henry VIII. to all per&s;ons, (other than the offend|ers,
their heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and &s;uch per&s;ons
as claim to any of their u&s;es) of all &s;uch <HI>right,</HI>
title intere&s;t, &amp;c. as they might have had if the
act had not been made.</P>
<P>And in the ve&s;ting act of the 20th of his Ma|je&s;ty's
reign, there is a &s;aving to all per&s;ons (ex|cept
the forfeiting per&s;ons, their heirs, executors,
admini&s;trators, and a&s;&s;igns, and per&s;ons claiming
to their u&s;e, or in tru&s;t for them) of their e&s;tate,
<PB N="396" REF="411">
right, title, intere&s;t, u&s;e, tru&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, rever|&s;ion,
remainder, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>And we are humbly of opinion, that the &s;aving
words in the&s;e acts, and particularly the word
<HI>right,</HI> are &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve the &s;everal e&s;tates
or intere&s;ts of the &s;ub&s;titutes in this &s;ettlement
from forfeiture.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Regulations of the commi&s;&s;ioners for ad|mini&s;tration
of ju&s;tice in the years 1652
and 1654.</HEAD>
<P>IT is remarkable, that any important object
which concerns the whole &s;ociety, &s;uch as, a
&s;truggle for liberty, or for religion, never fails to
rai&s;e a patriotic &s;pirit, which &s;preads it&s;elf upon
every intere&s;ting &s;ubject. During the civil war
in the reign of Charles I. many improvements in
law were introduced into Scotland, by parlia|ments
held without authority from the &s;overeign.
At the re&s;toration, the&s;e parliaments were decla|red
illegal, and their proceedings annulled by the
lump. Many acts, however, of the&s;e illegal par|liaments,
were of too great importance to be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed:
they were adopted after the re&s;toration
and made part of our law. From the &s;ame &s;pirit
of patrioti&s;m, many &s;alutary regulations were al&s;o
introduced by the high court of ju&s;tice, acting by
<PB N="402" REF="417">
the authority of Oliver Cromwell; &s;ome of which
were moulded into acts of parliament at different
times after the re&s;toration. But the whole de|&s;erve
to be kept in memory, as making &s;o many
links in the hi&s;tory of our law. Some of them
have been mentioned formerly<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Briti&s;h Antiquities, e&s;&s;ay 4. part. 2.; Article 35. of the pre&s;ent work.</NOTE>. Others fol|low.</P>
<P>Regulations concerning the abridging expence
or trouble in matters of law, &s;hall take the lead.
Originally, a precept of &s;ei&s;in was contained in a
writing different from the charter; which multi|plied
title-deeds, be&s;ide &s;welling the expence.
Therefore, in the regulations 1652 it is enacted,
&startq;That all charters whereupon &s;ei&s;in is to follow,
&s;hall contain precepts of &s;ei&s;in ingro&s;&s;ed, or on
the back thereof.&endq; This regulation is copied
in the act 7. parl. 1672, &s;o far as to &startq;di&s;charge
the pa&s;&s;ing or writing of any precept of &s;ei&s;in to
or under the quarter-&s;eal; and ordaining, that
in lieu thereof, every charter &s;hall towards the
end contain a precept of &s;ei&s;in of all the
lands.&endq; And this act was extended in practice
to charters from &s;ubjects. In the regulations 1654
enacted, &startq;That every decreet to be pronounced
by the &s;heriff or commi&s;&s;ary, &s;hall contain in
the clo&s;e thereof the&s;e words, <HI>Ordains execu|tion
to pa&s;s hereupon in due and competent
<PB N="403" REF="418">
form, after the charge hereby warranted to
be given is orderly given and expired.</HI> Which
is hereby declared to be as valid and effectual
as precepts formerly were; and that all execu|tion
&s;hall follow accordingly. Wherefore there
&s;hall be no precepts hereafter given out nor ex|tracted
to any party upon their decreet, but
allenarly the decreet it&s;elf.&endq; As this &s;alutary
regulation was put in practice during the u&s;urpa|tion,
the general intere&s;t has kept it in force to this
day; for it never received the &s;anction of an act
of parliament. In the &s;ame view, the following
article is contained in the regulations 1654:
&startq;That licences be granted both before and after
confirmation <HI>excludendo &s;ententiam,</HI> upon
con&s;ignation of half of the ordinary price of
confirmation for the &s;ums contained in the li|cence,
which &s;hall be allowed at confirmation;
the&s;e licences to be recorded for the u&s;e of all
parties having intere&s;t.&endq; It was a barbarous
practice, to debar a party from in&s;i&s;ting upon a
doubtful claim, till he &s;hould purcha&s;e the privi|lege
from the commi&s;&s;ary. The high court of
ju&s;tice was &s;en&s;ible that a remedy was nece&s;&s;ary;
but their regulation, like other reformations in
law, is imperfect. For why pay the half of the
ordinary dues for confirming a doubtful claim
that may produce nothing to the pur&s;uer but
trouble and expence? But the commi&s;&s;aries,
who&s;e intere&s;t it is to facilitate &s;uits of this kind,
<PB N="404" REF="419">
completed the remedy, by granting licences with|out
payment of any part of the dues of confirma|tion,
re&s;erving to draw the full dues in ca&s;e of
&s;ucce&s;s. I add one in&s;tance more. As the dues
of the privy &s;eal are much higher than tho&s;e of the
&s;ignet, there is in the regulations 1652 and order,
&startq;That writs heretofore wrote by the writers to
the privy &s;eal, &s;hall and may hereafter be writ|ten
by writers to the &s;ignet.&endq; This made
law, while the high court of ju&s;tice &s;ub&s;i&s;ted:
the practice was kept in force after the re&s;tora|tion,
by tacit con&s;ent of the nation; and the
writers to the privy &s;eal had not &s;ufficient autho|rity
to &s;tand in oppo&s;ition. With the &s;ame &s;pirit
of frugality, &s;ummons of error were appointed
to be drawn in Engli&s;h, by the writers to the &s;ig|net;
and to pa&s;s the &s;ignet as an ordinary &s;um|mons,
without pa&s;&s;ing any other &s;eal.</P>
<P>This court was equally &s;olicitous to abridge the
tedious delay of bringing defendants into court.
By the regulations 1652, &s;ummons of improba|tion
are appointed to be executed on twenty-one
days; and &s;ummons of exhibition, on &s;ix days,
omitting the alternative in the old &s;tyle. Such re|gulations
cannot be effectual again&s;t defendants,
but by force of law. The court of &s;e&s;&s;ion renew|ed
both by act of &s;ederunt 29th June 1672.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners went &s;till further in abrid|ging
judicial proceedings. In all proce&s;&s;es of old,
it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ummon the defendant four
<PB N="405" REF="420">
different times before he was bound to appear.
The&s;e &s;ummons were reduced to three, as ap|pears
from parl. 1449, cap. 30.; and afterward
to two. This was made &s;till more ea&s;y by the re|gulations
1652, enacting, &startq;That there be no con|tinuation
of the principal &s;ummons bear
two diets of compearance; to both which
diets the defender may be &s;ummoned by a &s;he|riff
in that part, albeit the &s;ummons for the &s;e|cond
diet be directed to me&s;&s;engers at arms;
except where the pur&s;uer intends to refer the
libel to the oath of party; in which ca&s;e,
the &s;econd citation to be given by a me&s;&s;enger
at arms.&endq; This regulation, which fell to the
ground upon the re&s;toration, was renewed in the
6th act, parl. 1672; and improved by act
12th, parl. 1693, authori&s;ing one citation for both
diets of compearance. Here all &s;ummons before
the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion are reduced to a &s;ingle cita|tion;
and yet, &s;uch is the influence of cu&s;tom,
that the two diets of compearance are kept up in
words, though aboli&s;hed in reality.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame regulations it is enacted, &startq;That
there be only one term granted for probation
by witne&s;&s;es, of libel, exception, or reply:
And that there be only two diligences granted
again&s;t the witne&s;&s;es cited to that term; the
fir&s;t to bear certification, that if they compear
not, certification &s;hall be directed again&s;t them;
<PB N="406" REF="421">
and the &s;econd to bear caption, with a penal|ty
<HI>ad arbitrium judicis.</HI>&endq; This regulation is
al&s;o renewed parl. 1672, act 16.</P>
<P>Active and pa&s;&s;ive transferences did of old oc|ca&s;ion
both expence and delay. It crept into
our practice from the Roman law, that a repre|&s;entative
could not even carry on a proce&s;s com|menced
by his predece&s;&s;or, without entering heir
to it. This produced an active transference;
which is, a &s;entence by a judge transferring the
proce&s;s from the decea&s;ed to his heir. In the li|bel,
and decreet of transference, the original pro|ce&s;s
was <HI>verbatim</HI> ingro&s;&s;ed. This Lord Stair
complains of as an impo&s;ition on the lieges<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In&s;titutes, book 4. tit. 34.</NOTE>;
and &s;ays, that it is now well altered, the proce&s;s
being only expre&s;&s;ed by a breviate. But he does
not &s;ay, that this was owing to the high court
of ju&s;tice ordaining, in their regulations 1652,
&startq;That in &s;ummons of transferring there be no
nece&s;&s;ity to ingro&s;s <HI>ad longum</HI> the bonds, con|tracts,
decreets, and others to be transferred,
but only to expre&s;s the date and &s;ub&s;tance
thereof in a &s;ummary way.&endq; There could be
but one further improvement of an active tran&s;|ference;
which is, to intitle the heir to carry on
the proce&s;s without it; which was done, parl.
1693, act 15.</P>
<P>When the defendant in a proce&s;s died, a de|cree
<PB N="407" REF="422">
was al&s;o thought nece&s;&s;ary transferring the
proce&s;s again&s;t his repre&s;entatives. And this was
termed a transference <HI>pa&s;&s;iv&egrave;.</HI> This form was
thought unnece&s;&s;ary by the high court of ju&s;tice.
It is enacted in the regulations 1652, &startq;That there
be no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ummons of transferring of
proce&s;s; but that a wakening be rai&s;ed, con|cluding
again&s;t the defenders upon the pa&s;&s;ive
titles.&endq; <HI>N. B.</HI> A wakening is nece&s;&s;ary, be|cau&s;e
an heir has a year to deliberate. This was
reducing the matter to its &s;imple&s;t form, &s;o as
to need no further improvement. And a tran&s;|ference
<HI>pa&s;&s;iv&egrave;,</HI> according to the form then u&s;ed,
was confirmed by the &s;aid act 15. parl. 1693.</P>
<P>A very irregular practice having crept in, of
poinding on decrees and regi&s;trate bonds, with|out
giving a debtor time to prepar for payment;
&startq;by which,&endq; &s;ays Sir George Mackenzie, &startq;no|blemen
and per&s;ons of quality were oft times
affronted, and merchants ruined;&endq; this prac|tice
was corrected by the high court of ju&s;tice,
enacting in their regulations 1654, &startq;That no
poinding be u&s;ed upon any decreet till the par|ty
be charged upon fifteen days on ordinary
decreets, or upon the days contained in the
clau&s;e of regi&s;tration in writs; and until the
&s;aid days be expired.&endq; This regulation was
renewed parl. 1669, act 4.</P>
<P>While writing was rare, &s;everal judicial acts
were &s;u&s;tained without being te&s;ted; which bred
<PB N="408" REF="423">
confu&s;ion, and frequently made a proof by wit|ne&s;&s;es
nece&s;&s;ary. To remedy that evil, it was
appointed in the regulations 1652, &startq;That all ex|ecutions
of &s;ummons and letters be &s;ub&s;cribed
by the parties executors, conform to act 141.
parl. 1592.&endq; And in the regulations 1654,
&startq;That he who is to be cautioner in the te&s;tament
be made to &s;ub&s;cribe the act of cautionry,
either with his own hand, or by notars before
witne&s;&s;es; otherwi&s;e that the &s;ame &s;hall make
no faith.&endq; This regulation is of &s;uch a nature
as to be kept in force by the intere&s;t that par|ties
have in it; without nece&s;&s;ity of being re|newed
by an act of parliament.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners were no le&s;s &s;olicitous to
mitigate &s;evere penalties; &s;uch e&s;pecially as the
nature of the offence cannot ju&s;tify. Vitious in|tromi&s;&s;ion
is a flagrant in&s;tance: the man who
intermeddles irregularly with moveables that be|longed
to a per&s;on decea&s;ed, is &s;ubjected to that
per&s;on's whole debts, without regard to their ex|tent.
Our authors do not &s;ay how that barba|rous
practice was introduced; and we mu&s;t be
&s;atisfied with a conjecture. <HI>Ge&s;tio pro herede</HI> is
a pa&s;&s;ive title early adopted by us from the Ro|man
law. An heir cannot ju&s;tly be bound for
his predece&s;&s;or's debts without his con&s;ent. But
that con&s;ent requires not a formal writing: it is
&s;ufficient to infer con&s;ent, that he behaves as heir,
and lays hold of his predece&s;&s;or's effects. The
<PB N="409" REF="424">
ca&s;e of a &s;tranger who purloins the moveables of
a per&s;on decea&s;ed, without pretending to have
any right, differs widely from the <HI>ge&s;tio pro he|rede,</HI>
which is an indication of the heir's will to
repre&s;ent his predece&s;&s;or, and is in no degree pe|nal.
And yet a circum&s;tance common to both,
viz. That the effects intermeddled with belonged
to a decea&s;ed per&s;on, has unwarily led our forefa|thers
to con&s;ider vitious intromi&s;&s;ion as a &s;ort of
<HI>ge&s;tio pro herede.</HI> The penalty of vitious in|tromi&s;&s;ion
cannot po&s;&s;ibly have another foun|dation:
and to put the matter pa&s;t doubt, vi|tious
intromi&s;&s;ion is handled as one of the pa&s;|&s;ive
titles, by Lord Stair, and by every wri|ter
after him. This &s;hows in our forefathers
great cloudine&s;s in conceptions of law; con&s;ider|ing
e&s;pecially a regulation in the Roman law
&s;trictly appo&s;ite to this ca&s;e. The per&s;on who
purloined any moveables in the calamity of a
conflagration or of a &s;hipwreck, was made liable
in double: what pretext could there be for pu|ni&s;hing
more &s;everely the delict under con&s;idera|tion?
The penalty here, at the &s;ame time, may
be very great or very &s;mall; and a penalty of
that kind always gives hope of impunity. If the
per&s;on died <HI>obaeratus,</HI> vitious intromi&s;&s;ion may be
a total forfeiture. If, on the other hand, the
per&s;on left &s;ufficient to pay his debts, vitious in|tromi&s;&s;ion
will not even infer the double; for
the intermeddler, who is compelled to pay the
debts, is entitled to be relieved by the heir or
<PB N="410" REF="425">
executor<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Craig, lib. 2. dieg. 17. &s;ect. 16.</NOTE>. If the per&s;on decea&s;ed had no debts
at all, the vitious intromitter runs no ri&s;k but
&s;imply of re&s;titution. In days of ignorance, I am
not &s;urpri&s;ed at crude and indi&s;tinct notions of
law. But I am &s;urpri&s;ed, that vitious intromi&s;|&s;ion
&s;hould have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in vigour, perhaps
two centuries, without ever having been found
fault with before the time of Cromwell's judges.
They &s;aw through the thin veil of a pa&s;&s;ive title;
and in their regulations 1654, article 12. they
enact, &startq;That the certification of all vitious in|tromi&s;&s;ion
&s;hall be no farther extended than
for what the double value thereof &s;hall be pro|ven
to extend to.&endq; And what greatly &s;urpri|&s;es
me is, that even after this regulation, the veil
remained &s;till impenetrable by the judges who &s;uc|ceeded.
The regulation, however ju&s;t and pro|per,
could not be &s;upported but by legal authori|ty.
People are more &s;wayed by intere&s;t than
by moderation; and creditors are commonly in|tent
to have their claims made effectual, by
whatever means. Vitious intromi&s;&s;ion, accor|dingly,
after the re&s;toration, was held to be a
pa&s;&s;ive title as originally. And it continued in
force till it was undermined by our pre&s;ent mild
manners; moderation prevailing among our
judges, and regularity among our people. At
pre&s;ent, it is never heard of in a court of ju&s;tice,
more than if it did not make a branch of our
municipal law.</P>
