<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>WHAT various revolutions in our art,</L>
<L>Since The&s;pis fir&s;t &s;ung ballads in a cart!</L>
<L>By nature fram'd the witty war to wage,</L>
<L>And lay the deep foundations of the &s;tage,</L>
<L>From his own &s;oil that bard his pictures drew:</L>
<L>The gaping crowd the mimic features knew,</L>
<L>And the broad je&s;t with fire electric flew.</L>
<L>Succeeding times, more poli&s;h'd and refin'd,</L>
<L>To rigid rules the comic mu&s;e confin'd:</L>
<L>Robb'd of the nat'ral freedom of her &s;ong,</L>
<L>In artful mea&s;ures now &s;he floats along;</L>
<L>No &s;prightly &s;allies rou&s;e the &s;lumb'ring pit;</L>
<L>Thalia, grown mere architect in wit,</L>
<L>To doors and ladders has confin'd her cares,</L>
<L>Convenient clo&s;ets, and a &s;nug back-&s;tairs;</L>
<L>'Twixt her and Satire has di&s;&s;olv'd the league,</L>
<L>And jilted humour to enjoy intrigue.</L>
<L>To gain the &s;uff'rage of this poli&s;h'd age,</L>
<L>We bring to-night a &s;tranger on the &s;tage:</L>
<L>His &s;ire De Vega; we confe&s;s this truth,</L>
<L>Le&s;t you mi&s;take him for a Briti&s;h youth.</L>
<L>Severe the cen&s;ure on my feeble pen,</L>
<L>Neglecting manners, that &s;he copies men:</L>
<L>Thus, if I hum or ha, or name report,</L>
<L>'Tis Serjeant Splitcau&s;e from the inns of court;</L>
<L>If, at the age that ladies cea&s;e to dance,</L>
<L>To romp at Ranelagh, or read romance,</L>
<L>I draw a dowager inclin'd to man,</L>
<L>Or paint her rage for china or japan,</L>
<L>The true original is quickly known,</L>
<L>And Lady Squab proclaim'd throughout the town.</L>
<L>But in the following group let no man dare</L>
<L>To claim a limb, nay, not a &s;ingle hair:</L>
<L>What gallant Briton can be &s;uch a &s;ot</L>
<L>To own the child a Spaniard has begot.</L>

<P>Ah, bravo, bravo!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but, my dear Papillion, you mu&s;t give me the chart du paye: This town is a new world to me; my provident papa, you know, would never &s;uffer me near the &s;moak of London; and what can be his motive for per|mitting me now, I can't readily conceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ni moi.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall, however, take the liberty to conceal my arrival from him for a few days.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vous avez rai&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Mentor, and how am I to manage? direct my road: where mu&s;t I begin? but the debate is, I &s;uppo&s;e, of con&s;equence?</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't compliment you upon your progre&s;s in Engli&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>The accent is difficult.</P>

<P>Sans doute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, open your lecture: And, d'ye hear, Papillion, as you have the honour to be promoted from the mortifying condition of an humble valet, to the important charge of a private tutor, let us di&s;card all di&s;tance between us: See me ready to &s;lack my thir&s;t at your fountain of knowledge, my Magnus Apollo.</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey, Papillion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is this? why, you &s;peak Engli&s;h!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>But like a native!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what am I to conclude from all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Logically thus, Sir: Whoever &s;peaks pure Engli&s;h is an Engli&s;hman: I &s;peak pure Engli&s;h; ergo, I am an Engli&s;hman. There's a categorical fyllogi&s;m for you, Major, Minor, and Con&s;equence. What, do you think, Sir, that whil&s;t you was bu&s;y at Oxford, I was idle? no, no, no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, but notwith&s;tanding your plea&s;antry, I mu&s;t have this matter explain'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you &s;hall, my good Sir; but don't be in &s;uch a hurry: You can't &s;uppo&s;e I would give you the key, unle&s;s I meant you &s;hould open the door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, prythee, unlock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Immediately. But, by way of entering upon my po&s;t as preceptor, &s;uffer me fir&s;t to give you a hint: You mu&s;t not expect, Sir, to find here, as at Oxford, men appearing in their real characters; every body there, Sir, knows that Dr. Mu&s;&s;y is a fellow of Maudlin, and Tom Trifle a &s;tudent of Chri&s;tchurch; but this town is one great comedy, in which not only the prin|ciples, but frequently the per&s;ons are feign'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>A u&s;eful ob&s;ervation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why now, Sir, at the fir&s;t coffee-hou&s;e I &s;hall enter you, you will perhaps meet a man from who&s;e decent &s;able dre&s;s, placid counte|nance, in&s;inuating behaviour, &s;hort &s;word, with the waiter's civil addition of "a di&s;h of coffee
<PB N="4" REF="7">
for Dr. Julap," you would &s;uppo&s;e him to be a phy&s;ician.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does not know dia&s;cordium from dia|culum. An ab&s;olute French &s;py, conceal'd un|der the &s;helter of a huge medicinal perriwig.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>A martial figure too, it is odds but you will encounter; from who&s;e &s;ears, title, dre&s;s, and addre&s;s, you would &s;uppo&s;e to have had a &s;hare in every action &s;ince the peace of the Py|renees: runner to a gaming-table, and bully to a bawdy-hou&s;e. Battles, to be &s;ure, he has been in&mdash;with the watch; and frequently a pri&s;oner too&mdash;in the round-hou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amazing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>In &s;hort, Sir, you will meet with lawyers who practi&s;e &s;muggling, and merchants who trade upon Houn&s;low-heath; reverend athei&s;ts, righ honourable &s;harpers; and Frenchmen f$om the county of York.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the la&s;t li&s;t, I pre&s;ume, you roll.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ju&s;t my &s;ituation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Sir, what may be your $Word$ for this wh$m&s;ical transformation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very harmle&s;s one, I promi&s;e you: I would only avail my&s;elf at the expence of folly and pr$ju$ice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir&mdash;But, to be better under|&s;tood, I believe it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give you a &s;hort &s;ketch of the principal incidents of my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then you are to know, Sir, that my former &s;ituation has been rather above my pre&s;ent condition, having once &s;u&s;tained the dig|nity of &s;ub-preceptor to one of tho&s;e cheap rural
<PB N="5" REF="8">
academies with which our county of York is &s;o plentifully &s;tock'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to the point: Why this di&s;gui&s;e? why renounce your country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, Sir, you make a little mi&s;take; it was my country that renounc'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>In an in&s;tant, upon quitting the &s;chool, and fir&s;t coming to town, I got recommended to the compiler of the Monthly Review.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, an author too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, a voluminous one: the whole re|gion of the belles lettres fell under my in&s;pec|tion; phy&s;ic, divinity, and the mathematics, my mi&s;tre&s;s manag'd her&s;elf. There, Sir, like an|other Ari&s;tarch, I dealt out fame and damnation at plea&s;ure. In obedience to the caprice and commands of my ma&s;ter, I have condemn'd books I never read, and applauded the fidelity of a tran&s;lation, without under&s;tanding one &s;yllable of the original.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! why I thought acutene&s;s of di&s;|cernment, and depth of knowledge, were ne|ce&s;&s;ary to accompli&s;h a critic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; but not a monthly one. Our method was very conci&s;e: We copy the title|page of a new book; we never go any further: if we are order'd to prai&s;e it, we have at hand about ten words, which, &s;catter'd through as many periods, effectually does the bu&s;ine&s;s; as, "laudable de&s;ign, happy arrangement, &s;pirited language, nervous &s;entiment, elevation of thought, conclu&s;ive argument;" if we are to decry, then we have, "unconnected, flat, fal&s;e, illiberal &s;tric|ture, reprehen&s;ible, unnatural:" and thus, Sir, we pepper the author, and &s;oon rid our hands of his work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>A &s;hort recipe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Sir, you have all the materials that are nece&s;&s;ary: The&s;e are the arms with which we engage authors of every kind. To us all &s;ubjects are equal; plays or &s;ermons, poetry or politics, mu&s;ic or midwifry, it is the &s;ame thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>How came you to re&s;ign this ea&s;y employment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would not an&s;wer. Notwith&s;tanding what we &s;ay, people will judge for them&s;elves; our work hung upon hand, and all I could get from the publi&s;her was four &s;hillings a-week, and my &s;mall beer. Poor pittance!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, half-&s;tarv'd me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was your next change?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was mightily puzzled to choo&s;e. Some would have had me turn player, and others me|thodi&s;t preacher; but as I had no money to build me a tabernacle, I did not think it could an&s;wer; and as to a player&mdash;whatever might happen to me, I was determin'd not to bring a di&s;grace upon my family, and &s;o I re&s;olv'd to turn footman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wi&s;ely re&s;olv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, but not &s;o ea&s;ily executed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, Sir. Many a weary &s;tep have I taken after a place: here I was too old, there I was too young; here the la&s;t livery was too big, there it was too little; here I was aukward, there I was knowing; madam di&s;&s;ik'd me at this hou&s;e, her lady&s;hip's woman at the next: So that I was as much puzzled to find out a place, as the great Cynic philo&s;opher to di&s;cover a man. In &s;hort, I was quite in a &s;tate of de&s;pair, when Chance threw an old friend in my way that quite retriev'd my affairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="10">
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray who might he be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little bit of a Swi&s;s genius, who had been French u&s;her with me at the &s;ame &s;chool in the country. I open'd my melancholy &s;tory to him, over three pennyworth of beef-a la|mode, in a cellar in St. Ann's. My little foreign friend purs'd up his lanthorn jaws, and with a &s;hrug of contempt, "Ah, ma&icirc;tre Jean, vous n'avez pas la politique; you have no fine&s;&s;e: to trive here you mu&s;t &s;tudy the folly of your own country." "How, Mon&s;ieur!" "Tai&s;ez vous. Keep a your tongue! autre foy! I teach you &s;peak French, now I teach a you to forget Eng|li&s;h. Go vid me to my logement, I vil give you proper dre&s;s; den go pre&s;ent your&s;elf to de &s;ame hotels, de very &s;ame hou&s;e; you will find all de doors dat was &s;hut in your face as footman An|glois, will fly open dem&s;elves to a French valet de chambre."</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Papillion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gad, Sir, I thought it was but an ho|ne&s;t artifice, &s;o I determin'd to follow my friend's advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did it &s;ucceed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Better than expectation: my tawny face, long que&uuml;e, and broken Engli&s;h, was a pas par tout. Be&s;ides, when I am out of place, this di&s;gui&s;e procures me many re&s;ources.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, at a pinch, Sir, I am either a teacher of tongues, a frizeur, a denti&s;t, or a dancing-ma&s;ter; the&s;e, Sir, are hereditary profe&s;|&s;ions to Frenchmen. But now, Sir, to the point: As you were pleas'd to be &s;o candid with me, I was determin'd to have no re&s;erve with you. You have &s;tudy'd books, I have &s;tudy'd men; you want advice, and I have &s;ome at your &s;ervice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11">
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll be your cu&s;tomer.</P>
</SP>

<P>You may rely upon me.</P>

<P>In a few years I &s;hall be in a condition to retire from bu&s;ine&s;s; but whether I &s;hall &s;et|tle at my family-&s;eat, or pa&s;s over to the conti|nent, is as yet undetermined. Perhaps, in gra|titude to the country, I may purcha&s;e a marqui|&s;ate near Paris, and &s;pend the money I have got by their means, generou&s;ly among&s;t them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>A grateful intention. But let us &s;ally. Where do we open?</P>

<P>Proceed.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well.</P>

<P>Oh, pardon me, Sir; I don't &s;ay that; no, no: only a little apt to embelli&s;h; that's all. To be &s;ure it is a fine gift; that there is no di&s;|puting: but men in general are &s;o &s;tupid; &s;o ri|gorou&s;ly attach'd to matter of fact&mdash;And yet this talent of yours is the very &s;oul and &s;pirit of poetry; and why it &s;hould not be the &s;ame in pro&s;e, I can't for my life determine.</P>

<P>My medicine was &s;omewhat rough, Sir; but in de&s;perate ca&s;es, you know&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>If his cure is compleated, he will gratefully acknowledge the cau&s;e; if not, the puni&s;hment comes far &s;hort of his crimes. It is needle&s;s to pay you any compliments, Sir James; with that lady you can't fail to be happy. I &s;han't venture to hint a &s;cheme I have greatly at heart, till we have undeniable proofs of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of our operations. To the ladies, indeed, no character is &s;o dangerous as that of a lyar.</P>
<L>They in the faire&s;t fames can fix a flaw,</L>

<BYLINE>Between Mi&s;s GRANTAM and OLD WILDING. By a Man of Fa&s;hion.</BYLINE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Gr.</SPEAKER>
<L>HOLD, Sir.</L>
<L>Our plot concluded, and &s;trict ju&s;tice done,</L>
<L>Let me be heard as coun&s;el for your &s;on.</L>
<L>Acquit I can't; I mean to mitigate:</L>
<L>Pro&s;cribe all lying, what would be the fate</L>
<L>Of this and every other earthly &s;tate?</L>
<L>Con&s;ider, Sir, if once you cry it down,</L>
<L>You'll &s;hut up ev'ry coffee-hou&s;e in town:</L>
<L>The tribe of politicians will want food;</L>
<L>Ev'n now half-fami&s;h'd&mdash;for the public good.</L>
<L>All Grub&s;treet murderers of men and &s;en&s;e,</L>
<L>And every office of intelligence,</L>
<L>All would be bankrupts, the whole lying race,</L>
<L>And no Gazette to publi&s;h their di&s;grace.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<L>Too mild a &s;entence! mu&s;t the good and great</L>
<L>Patriots be wrong'd, that book&s;ellers may eat?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Gr.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your patience, Sir; yet hear another word.</L>
<L>Turn to that hall where ju&s;tice wields her &s;word:</L>
<L>Think in what narrow limits you would draw,</L>
<L>By this pro&s;cription, all the &s;ons of law:</L>
<L>For 'tis the fix'd, determin'd rule of courts,</L>
<L>Vyn$r will te$l you, nay, even Coke's Reports,</L>
<L>All pleaders may, when difficulties ri&s;e,</L>
<L>To gain one truth, expend a hundred lyes.</L>

<PB REF="71">
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<L>To curb this practice I am &s;omewhat loath;</L>
<L>A lawyer has no credit but on oath.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Gr.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then to the &s;ofter &s;ex &s;ome favour &s;hew:</L>
<L>Leave no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our mode&s;t No!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh, freely, Ma'am, we'll that allow|ance give,</L>
<L>So that two Noes be held affirmative.</L>
<L>Provid$d ever, that your pi&s;h and fie,</L>
<L>On all occa&s;ions, &s;hould be deem'd a lye.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Gr.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hard terms!</L>
<L>On this rejoinder then I re&s;t my cau&s;e;</L>
<L>Should all pay homage to Truth's &s;acred laws,</L>
<L>Let us examine what would be the ca&s;e:</L>
<L>Why, many a great man would be out of place.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twould many a virtuous character re&s;tore.</L>

<L>Tho' on the &s;ide of bad the ballance fall,</L>
<L>Better to find few good, than fear for all.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Gr.</SPEAKER>
<L>Strong are your rea&s;ons; yet, ere I &s;ubmit,</L>
<L>I mean to take the voices of the pit.</L>
<L>Is it your plea&s;ures that we make a rule,</L>
<L>That ev'ry lyar be proclaim'd a fool,</L>
<L>Fit &s;ubjects for our author's ridicule?</L>
