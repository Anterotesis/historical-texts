<P>_I Tell you, Sir, his love to me is all a pretence: it is amazing that you, who are &s;o acute, &s;o quick in di&s;|cerning on other occa&s;ions, &s;hould be &s;o blind upon this.</P>
</SP>

<P>But where are your proofs, Charlot? What &s;ignifies your opening matters which your evi|dence cannot &s;upport?</P>
</SP>

<P>Surely, Sir, &s;trong circum&s;tances in every court &s;hould have weight.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they have collaterally, child, that is by way as it were of corroboration, or where matters are doubtful; <Q>then indeed, as Plowden wi&s;ely, ob|&s;erves &startq;Les circon&s;tances ajout beaucoup de|poids aux faits.&endq;</Q>&mdash;You under&s;tand me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not perfectly well.</P>

<P>Then to explain by ca&s;e in point; A, we will &s;uppo&s;e, my dear, robs B of a watch upon Houn&s;low heath&mdash;dy'e mind, child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I do, Sir.</P>

<P>A, is taken up and indicted; B &s;wears po&s;i|tively to the idenity of A.&mdash;Dy'e ob&s;erve?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Attentively.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then what does me A, but &s;ets up the alibi C, to defeat the affidavit of B.&mdash;You take me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Clearly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far you &s;ee then the ballance is even.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then to turn the &s;cale, child, again&s;t A, in favour of B, they produce the circum&s;tance D, viz. B's watch found in the pocket of A; upon
<PB N="3" REF="7">
which, the te&s;timony of C being contradicted by B,&mdash;no, by D,&mdash;why then A, that is to &s;ay C,&mdash;no D,&mdash;joining B, they convict C,&mdash;no, no, A,&mdash;again&s;t the affidavit of C.&mdash;So this being pretty clear, child, I leave the application to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very obliging, Sir. But &s;uppo&s;e now, Sir, it &s;hould appear that the attention of Sir Luke Limp is directed to &s;ome other object, would not that induce you to&mdash;</P>
</SP>

<P>Suppo&s;e then, Sir, tho&s;e powerful charms which made a conque&s;t of you, may have ex|tended their empire over the heart of Sir Luke?</P>

<P>Overt acts!</P>

<P>Ay; that is any declaration by writing, or even word of mouth is &s;ufficient; then let 'em demur if they dare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't &s;ay that, Sir; but another organ has been pretty explicit.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>In tho&s;e ca&s;es a very infallible one&mdash;the eye.</P>

<P>Have a care, Charlot! I &s;ee on what ground your action is founded&mdash;jealou&s;y.</P>

<P>Indeed!</P>

<P>One foot in the grave! the re&s;t of his body is not a whit the nearer for that.&mdash;There has been only an execution i&s;&s;ued again&s;t part of his per|&s;onals, his real e&s;tate is unencumbered and free&mdash;be&s;ides, you &s;ee he does not mind it a whit, but is as alert, and as merry, as a defendant after non-&s;uiting a plaintiff for omitting an S.</P>

<P>O! Sir! I know how proud Sir Luke is of his leg, and have often heard him declare, that he would not change his bit of timber for the be&s;t fle&s;h and bone in the kingdom.</P>

<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, Sir, I am no &s;tranger to that noble man's attributes; but then, Sir, plea&s;e to con&s;i|der, his power as a peer he gives up to a proxy; the direction of his e&s;tate, to a rapacious, artful attorney: and as to his &s;kill in the elegant arts, I pre&s;ume you confine them to painting and mu&s;ic, he is directed in the fir&s;t by Mynheer Van Ei&s;el, a Dutch dauber; and in the la&s;t is but the echo of Signora Florenza, his lord|&s;hip's mi&s;tre&s;s and an opera &s;inger.</P>

<SPEAKER>SERJEANT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy upon us! at what a rate the jade runs!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>In &s;hort, Sir, I define every individual who, cea&s;ing to act for him&s;elf, becomes the tool, the mere engine of another man's will, to be nothing more than a cypher.</P>

<P>At this rate the jade will half unpeople the world: but what is all this to Sir Luke? to him, not one of your ca&s;es apply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every one&mdash;Sir Luke has not a fir&s;t princi|ple in his whole compo&s;ition; not only his plea|&s;ures, but even his pa&s;&s;ions are prompted by others; and he is as much directed to the ob|jects of his love and his hatred, as in his eating, drinking, and dre&s;&s;ing. Nay, though he is active, and eternally bu&s;y, yet his own private affairs are neglected; and he would not &s;cruple to break an appointment that was to determine a con&s;iderable part of his property, in order to

exchange a couple of hounds for a lord, or to buy a pad-nag for a lady. In a word&mdash;but he's at hand, and will explain him&s;elf be&s;t; I hear his &s;tump on the &s;tairs.</P>

Zounds! cried Lord Frederick, where can Weezy have been, not to have &s;een the Harietta before? for you mu&s;t know Frederick is a bit of Macaroni, and adores the &s;oft Italian termi|nation in <HI>a.</HI></P>
