Yet the&s;e, and Statues too of Stone and Bra&s;s are now de|vour'd by the Iron teeth of Time, and not &s;o much as the Founders Name left undefac'd, but Poets give eternal life to great Exploits, which thro variety of Languages gain univer&s;al Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>I am proud to be the fir&s;t that in this kind have laid an Offering at your Feet, thereby &s;hewing our greate&s;t wits a &s;ubject worthy their &s;ublime&s;t thoughts, for tho the Poet makes the Ver&s;e, 'tis the Hero makes the Poet.</P>
<P>Your Conduct, Bravery and Succe&s;s at Sea &s;hows you were born for War, and ju&s;tly cho&s;en to Com|mand a Fleet, that does Command the World, yet is not your Courage more terrible to your Ene|mies abroad than your courteous affability, and obliging conde&s;cention is charming, to your friends at home.</P>

on to make this &s;mall E&s;&s;ay in your Prai&s;e, and my Countries Honour, 'tis daring I confe&s;s in one who is unqualified for a Theme &s;o ample: But fear be|ing a Vice you ever hated, I may pre&s;ume to be more ea&s;ily pardon'd for this bold attempt, and al|low'd to lay hold of this opportunity of declaring to the World how much I am,</P>
