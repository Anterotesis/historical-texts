<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_BEFORE I come to treat of this Noble Subject, <HI>The A&s;tronomi|cal Sy&s;tem of the Univer&s;e,</HI> with its wonderful Con&s;equences as it is now di&s;covered to us by the good Providence of God, and the labo|rious Searches of this and the la&s;t Age; and chiefly, by the &s;urprizing Sagacity and Penetration of the Illu&s;trious Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton;</HI> I think it proper to premi&s;e <HI>two En|quiries,</HI> as of great Con&s;equence in way of Preparation to the receiving real Advantage by this Treati&s;e; and without Satisfaction wherein, all &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es will be of little Effect with many of its Peru&s;ers: I mean the Enquiry about that <HI>Temper of Mind,</HI> which is nece&s;&s;ary for the Di&s;covery of Divine
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
Truth; and the Enquiry into that <HI>Degree of Evidence,</HI> that ought to be expected in Divine Matters. For, if all our Knowledge be de|rived from God, and if it has plea&s;ed God to require a certain Degree of Probity, Se|riou&s;ne&s;s, Impartiality, and Humility of Mind; together with hearty Prayers to him for his Direction, Ble&s;&s;ing, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and a proper Submi&s;&s;ion to him, before he will communicate his Truths to Men; I mean, at lea&s;t, communicate the &s;ame &s;o as &s;hall make a due Impre&s;&s;ion upon their Minds, and turn to their real Profit and Edification, to their true Improvement in Virtue and Happine&s;s: And if Men at any time come to the Examination either of the <HI>Works</HI> or <HI>Word</HI> of God, without that Temper of Mind, and without tho&s;e Addre&s;&s;es for his Aid, and Submi&s;&s;ion to his Will, which He has deter|mined &s;hall be the Conditions of his Commu|nications to them; e&s;pecially if they come with the contrary Di&s;po&s;itions, with a Wick|ed, Partial, Proud, and Ludicrous Temper, and with an utter Di&s;regard to God, his Pro|vidence, Wor&s;hip, and Revelation; all their Re&s;earches will come to nothing. If, I &s;ay, this be the Ca&s;e, as to the Divine Knowledge, as I believe it is, it cannot but be highly nece&s;|&s;ary for us all to con&s;ider of this Matter be|forehand, and to endeavour after the proper
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
Qualifications, before we &s;et our &s;elves about the main Enquiries them&s;elves. If it has al&s;o plea&s;ed God to expect from us &s;ome more Deference and Regard for him, than for our poor fallible Fellow-Creatures here below; and to claim our Belief and Obedience, upon plain external Evidence, That certain Do|ctrines or Duties are derived from him, with|out our being always let into the Secrets of his Government, or acquainted with the Rea&s;ons of his Conduct; and al&s;o to expect that this plain external Evidence be treated, as it is in all the other Ca&s;es of Human Determina|tions and Judgments; I mean, that it be &s;ub|mitted to, and acquie&s;ced in, when it appears to be &s;uch, as in all other Ca&s;es would be allowed to be <HI>&s;atisfactory,</HI> and <HI>plainly &s;upe|rior</HI> to what it alledged to the contrary: If, I &s;ay, this al&s;o be the Ca&s;e as to Divine Knowledge, as I believe it is; It will be very proper for us all to con&s;ider of this Matter before-hand al&s;o; that &s;o we may not be af|terward di&s;appointed, when in our future Progre&s;s we do not always find that <HI>irre&s;i&s;tible</HI> and <HI>over-bearing</HI> Degree of Evidence for certain Divine Truths, which in &s;uch Ca&s;es is not to be had; which in truth is almo&s;t pecu|liar to the Mathematicks; and the Expecta|tion of which is &s;o common, tho' unju&s;t, a Pretence for Infidelity among us.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="6">As to the former of the&s;e Enquiries, or that <HI>Temper of Mind</HI> which is nece&s;&s;ary for the Di&s;covery of Divine Truth; it can certainly be no other than what the Light of Nature, and the Con&s;ciences of Men influ|enc'd thereby, dictate to us; tho&s;e, I mean, already intimated; &s;uch as Seriou&s;ne&s;s, In|tegrity, Impartiality, and Prayer to God; with the faithful Belief, and ready Practice of &s;uch Truths and Duites, as we do all along di&s;cover to be the Word and Will of God; together with &s;uch a Mode&s;ty, or Re&s;ignation of Mind, as will re&s;t &s;atisfy'd in certain &s;ublime Points, clearly above our Determina|tion, with full Evidence that they are re|vealed by God, without always in&s;i&s;ting, upon knowing the Rea&s;ons of the Divine Conduct therein immediately, before we will believe that Evidence. The&s;e are &s;uch things as all hone&s;t and &s;ober Men, who have naturally a Sen&s;e of Virtue and of God in their Minds, mu&s;t own their Obligation to. We all know, by the common Light of Nature, till we eclip&s;e or corrupt it by our own Wickedne&s;s, That we are to deal with the utmo&s;t Fairne&s;s, Hone&s;ty, and Integrity in all, e&s;pecially in Religious Matters; that we are to hearken to every Argument, and to con&s;ider every Te&s;timony without Prejudice, or Bya&s;s, and ever to pronounce agreeably to our Convicti|ons; that we are but Weak, Frail, Depen|dent
<PB N="v" REF="7">
Creatures, all who&s;e Faculties, and the Exerci&s;e of them, are derived from God; that we ought therefore to exerci&s;e a due Mode&s;ty, and practi&s;e a due Submi&s;&s;ion, of Mind in Divine Matters, particularly in the Search after the Nature, and Laws, and Pro|vidence of our great Creator: A Submi&s;&s;ion, I mean, not to Human, but to Divine Autho|rity, when once it &s;hall be authentickly made known to us: That the Humble Addre&s;&s;ing of our &s;elves to God for his Aid, Direction, and Ble&s;&s;ing on our Studies and Enquiries, is one plain In&s;tance of &s;uch our Submi&s;&s;ion to Him; and that a ready Compliance with Divine Revelation, and a ready Obedience to the Divine Will, &s;o far as we have clearly di&s;cover'd it, is another nece&s;&s;ary In&s;tance of the &s;ame humble Regard to the Divine Maje&s;ty. Nor indeed can any one who comes to the&s;e Sacred Enquiries with the oppo&s;ite Di&s;po&s;iti|ons, of Di&s;hone&s;ty, Partiality, Pride, Buf|foonry, Neglect of all Divine Wor&s;hip, and Contempt of all Divine Revelation, and of all Divine Laws, expect, even by the Light of Nature, that God &s;hould be oblig'd to di&s;|cover further Divine Truths to him. Nor will a &s;ober Per&s;on, duly &s;en&s;ible of the dif|ferent States of Creator and Creature, imi|tate <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> and his Followers, in the fir&s;t Ages of the Go&s;pel; and &s;et up &s;ome Metaphy&s;ical Subtilties, or Captious Que&s;tions
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
about the Conduct of Providence, as &s;uffici|ent to &s;et a&s;ide the Evidence of confe&s;&s;ed Mi|racles them&s;elves; but will rather agree to that wi&s;e Aphori&s;m laid down in the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;ed all over the Bible; That <HI>Secret Things belong unto the Lord;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deu. xxix. 29.</NOTE> <HI>but Things that are revealed, to Us and to our Children, that we may do them</HI>. Now in order to the making &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ions upon Men in this Matter, and the convincing them, that All our Di&s;coveries are to be de|rived from God; and that we are not to ex|pect his Ble&s;&s;ing upon our Enquiries, without the foregoing Qualifications, Devotions, and Obedience; Give me leave here, in&s;tead of my own farther Rea&s;oning, to &s;et down from the Ancient <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Wri|ters, &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages which &s;eem to me very remarkable and very pertinent to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e: Not now indeed, as &s;uppo&s;ing any of tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations of Sacred Authority, but as very right in them&s;elves; very agreeable to the Light of Nature; and very good Te|&s;timonies of the Sen&s;e of wi&s;e Men in the &s;everal ancient Ages of the World to this Purpo&s;e. And I chu&s;e to do this the more largely here, becau&s;e I think this Matter to be of very great Importance: becau&s;e it &s;eems to be now very little known or con&s;ider'd, at lea&s;t very little practis'd, by &s;everal pretended Enquirers into Reveal'd Religion; and be|cau&s;e

<BIBL>See this Matter further Pro&s;ecuted in my <HI>Chronology, p, 3&mdash;7.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Now from all this Evidence, and much more that might be alledg'd, it is apparent that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religions al|ways &s;uppo&s;e that there mu&s;t be a due Temper of Mind in the Enquirers, or el&s;e the Argu|ments for tho&s;e Religions will not have their due Effect. That the Cour&s;e of God's Provi|dence de&s;igns hereby to di&s;tingui&s;h between the well-di&s;pos'd, the Meek, the Humble, and the Pious; which are tho&s;e whom the common Light of Nature declares may expect the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing on their Studies of this &s;ort; and the Ill-di&s;pos'd, the Ob&s;ti|nate, the Proud and the Impious; which are tho&s;e whom the &s;ame common Light of Nature a&s;&s;ures us may expect the Divine Ma|lediction on the &s;ame: And that 'tis not for want of convincing and &s;atisfactory Evidence in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Revelation, but becau&s;e many Men come with Perver&s;e, Sceptical,
<PB N="xxii" REF="24">
and wicked Di&s;po&s;itions, that they fail of Satisfaction therein. Accordingly, I think it is true in common Ob&s;ervation, That the Virtuous and the Religious, I mean tho&s;e that are &s;uch according to Natural Con&s;cience do rarely, if ever, fail on their Enquiries to Embrace and Acquie&s;ce in both the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations; and that the Debauch'd and Prophane do as &s;eldom fail on their Enquiries to Reject and Ridicule them. Which different Succe&s;s of the &s;ame Exami|nation, agrees exactly with the whole Tenor of the Scriptures; and is the very &s;ame which mu&s;t be true, in ca&s;e tho&s;e Scriptures be true al&s;o; and is, by Con&s;equence, a con&s;i|derable Confirmation of their real Verity and In&s;piration. And certainly, he that con&s;iders his own Weakne&s;s and Dependance on God, and that all Truth and Evidence mu&s;t come originally from him, will by Natural Judg|ment and Equity pronounce, that he who expects the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing and Illumination, in Points of &s;uch va&s;t Con&s;equence, as tho&s;e of Revelation mo&s;t certainly are, ought above all things to purify his Will, and rectify his Conduct in &s;uch Points as all the World knows to be the Will of God; and to Addre&s;s him|&s;elf to the Divine Maje&s;ty with due Fervency and Seriou&s;ne&s;s, for his Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, before he can ju&s;tly promi&s;e him&s;elf Succe&s;s in &s;o great and momentous an Undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="25">But then as to the <HI>Second Enquiry,</HI> or the <HI>Degree of Evidence</HI> that ought to be expected in Religious Matters, it &s;eems to me very nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omewhat upon this Subject al&s;o, before we come to our main De|&s;ign. For as on the one Side it is a great Error in all Ca&s;es to expect &s;uch Evidence as the Nature of the Subject renders impo&s;|&s;ible; &s;o is it as weak on the other Side, to lay the Stre&s;s of important Truths on &s;uch Evidence, as is in its own Nature Un&s;ati&s;|factory and Precarious; or to a&s;&s;ert with great A&s;&s;urance what can no way be Proved, even by that &s;ort of Evidence which is proper for the Subject in Debate. And In&s;tance of the fir&s;t Sort we have in <HI>Autolycus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Theoph. ad Anto|lye, L. I. in initio.</NOTE> an Hea|then, in his Debates with <HI>Theophilus</HI> of <HI>Antioch;</HI> who appears weakly to have in&s;i&s;ted upon <HI>Seeing</HI> the God of the Chri&s;tians, e'er he would believe his Exi&s;tence: While one of the known Attributes of that God is, that he is <HI>Invi&s;ible</HI>. And almo&s;t equally prepo&s;terous would any Philo&s;ophick Sceptick now be, who &s;hould require the <HI>Sight</HI> of the Air in which we Breath, before he would believe that there was &s;uch an Element at all. Whereas it is clear, that the Air may be demon&s;trated to be &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible and real, by a Thou&s;and Experiments; while yet none of tho&s;e Expe|riments can render it <HI>Vi&s;ible</HI> to us: Ju&s;t as the Exi&s;tence of a Supreme Being may be
<PB N="xxiv" REF="26">
demon&s;trated by innumerable Arguments, al|though none of tho&s;e Arguments imply even the Po&s;&s;ibility of his being properly <HI>Seen</HI> by any of his Creatures. But then, that we may keep a Mean here, and may neither on one Side, expect in our Religious Enquiries, <HI>overbearing,</HI> or &s;trictly <HI>Mathematick Evi|dence,</HI> &s;uch as is impo&s;&s;ible to be deny'd or doubted of by any; which would render the con&s;tant De&s;ign of Providence, already &s;tated entirely ineffectual, and <HI>force</HI> both Good and Bad to be Believers, without all Regard to their Qualifications and Temper of Mind: Nor on the other Side, may depend on &s;uch weak and precarious Arguments, as are not really &s;ufficient nor &s;atisfactory to even Fair, Hone&s;t, and Impartial Men; I intend here to Con&s;ider, what that Degree of Evidence is, which ought to be here in&s;i&s;ted on; without which we are not, and with which we are obliged to acquie&s;ce in Divine Matters. Now this Degree of Evidence I take to be that, and no other, which upright Judges are de|termin'd by in all the important Affairs of E&s;tate and Life that come before them: And according to which, they ever aim to give Sentence in their Courts of Judicature. I chu&s;e to In&s;tance in this Judicial Evidence, and the&s;e Judicial Determinations e&s;pecially, becau&s;e the Per&s;ons concern'd in &s;uch Matters are, by long U&s;e, and the Nature of their
<PB N="xxv" REF="27">
Employment, generally &s;peaking, the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;agacious Di&s;coverers of Truth, and tho&s;e that judge the mo&s;t unbia&s;s'dly and fairly, concerning &s;ufficient or in&s;ufficient Evi|dence of all others. Such upright Judges then, never expect &s;trictly Undeniable, or Mathematick Evidence; which they know is, in Human Affairs, ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to be had: They don't require that the Witne&s;&s;es they Examine, &s;hould be Infallible, or Im|peccable, which they are &s;en&s;ible would be alike Wild and Ridiculous: Yet do they ex|pect full, &s;ufficient, or convincing Evidence; and &s;uch a is plainly Superior to what is al|ledged on the other Side: And they require that the Witne&s;&s;es they believe, be, &s;o far as they are able to di&s;cover, of a good Cha|racter, Upright and Faithful. Nor do they think it too much Trouble to u&s;e their utmo&s;t Skill and Sagacity in di&s;covering where the Truth lies; how far the Witne&s;&s;es agree with or contradict each other; and which way the &s;everal Circum&s;tances may be be&s;t compar'd, &s;o as to find out any Forgery, or detect any Kna|very which may be &s;u&s;pected in any Branches of the Evidence before them. They do not them&s;elves pretend to judge of the Reality or Obligation of any Ancient Laws, or Acts of Parliament, from their own meer Gue&s;&s;es or Inclinations, but from the Authentickne&s;s of the Records which contain them; and though
<PB N="xxvi" REF="28">
they are not able always to &s;ee the Rea&s;on, or Occa&s;ion, or Wi&s;dom of &s;uch Laws, or Acts of Parliament; yet do they, upon full External Evidence that they are Genuine, allow and execute the &s;ame: As con&s;idering them&s;elves to be not Legi&s;lators, but Judges: And own|ing that Ancient Laws, and Ancient Facts, are to be known not by Gue&s;&s;es or Suppo&s;als, but by the Production of Ancient Records, and Original Evidence for their Reality. Nor in &s;uch their Procedure do they think them&s;elves guilty in their Sentences, if at any Time afterwards they di&s;cover that they have been impos'd upon by fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es, or forged Records; &s;uppo&s;ing, I mean, that they are con&s;cious that they did their utmo&s;t to di&s;|cover the Truth, and went exactly by the be&s;t Evidence that lay before them; as know|ing they have done their Duty, and mu&s;t in &s;uch a Ca&s;e be Blamele&s;s before God and Man, notwith&s;tanding the Mi&s;take in the Sentences them&s;elves. Now this is that Procedure which I would earne&s;tly recommend to tho&s;e that have a Mind to enquire to good Purpo&s;e into Re|veal'd Religion. That after they have taken Care to purge them&s;elves from all tho&s;e Vices, which will make it their great Intere&s;t that Religion &s;hould be fal&s;e; after they have re|&s;olv'd upon Hone&s;ty, Impartiality, and Mo|de&s;ty, which are Virtues by the Law of Na|ture; after they have devoutly implor'd the
<PB N="xxvii" REF="29">
Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Ble&s;&s;ing on this their important. Undertaking; which is a Duty likewi&s;e they are obliged to by the &s;ame Law of Nature; that after all this Preparation, I &s;ay, they will &s;et about the Enquiry it &s;elf, in the very &s;ame Manner that has been al|ready de&s;crib'd, and that all our upright Judges proceed by in the Di&s;covery of Truth. Let them &s;pare for no Pains, but con&s;ult all the Originals, whenever they can come at them: And let them u&s;e all that Diligence, Sagacity and Judgment, which they are Ma|&s;ters of, in order to &s;ee what real External Evidence there is for the Truth of the Facts on which the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religions do depend. I here &s;peak of the <HI>Truth of Facts,</HI> as the &s;ure&s;t way to determine us in this Enquiry; becau&s;e all the World, I think, owns that if tho&s;e Facts be true, the&s;e In&s;ti|tutions of Religion mu&s;t al&s;o be true, or be deriv'd from God; and that no particular Difficulties, as to the Rea&s;ons of &s;everal Laws, or the Conduct of Providence in &s;eve|ral Ca&s;es, which tho&s;e In&s;titutions no where pretend to give us a full Account of, can be &s;ufficient to &s;et a&s;ide the convincing Evidence which the Truth of &s;uch Facts brings along with it. For Example: Tho&s;e who are well &s;atisfy'd of the Truth of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory of the Ten miraculous Plagues with which the God of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;mote the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> of

the drowning of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> in the <HI>Red-Sea;</HI> while the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were miraculou&s;ly conducted through the &s;ame; and of the ama|zing manner wherein the Decalogue was given by God to that People at Mount <HI>Sinai;</HI> will for certain, believe that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Religion was in the main derived from God, though he &s;hould find &s;everal occa&s;ional Pa&s;&s;ages in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Sacred Books, which he could not Account for, and &s;everal ritual Laws given that Nation, which he could not gue&s;s at the Rea&s;ons why they were given them. And the Ca&s;e is the very &s;ame as to the Miraculous Re&s;urrection, and Glorious A&s;cen&s;ion of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> with Regard to the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI>. On which Account I reckon that the Truth of &s;uch Facts is to be principally enquired into, when we have a mind to &s;atisfy our &s;elves in the Verity of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian Religions</HI>. And if it be alledg'd that &s;ome of the&s;e Facts are too remote to afford us any certain Means of Di&s;covery at this Di&s;tance of Time; I An|&s;wer, That then we are to &s;elect &s;uch of tho&s;e Facts as we can examine, and to &s;earch into the Acknowledgment or Denial of tho&s;e that are Ancienter, in the olde&s;t Te&s;timonies now Extant; into the Effects and Con&s;equences, and &s;tanding Memorials of &s;uch Facts in After Ages, and how far they were real, and al|low'd to be &s;o; and in &s;hort, we are to
<PB N="xxix" REF="31">
determine concerning them, by the be&s;t Evi|dence we can now have; and not let a bare Su&s;picion, or a Wi&s;h that Things had been otherwi&s;e, overbalance our real Evidence of Facts in any Ca&s;e what&s;oever. I do not mean that our Enquirer is to have no Regard to <HI>Internal Characters,</HI> or the <HI>Contents</HI> of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations; or that he is not to examine into that al&s;o in the General, before he admits even the Proof from Miracles them&s;elves; becau&s;e what pretended Miracles &s;oever are wrought for the Support of Idolatry, or Wickedne&s;s; for the E&s;tabli&s;ment of Notions contrary to the Divine Artributes, or of an Immortal, or Prophane, or Cruel Religion, though they may prove &s;uch a Religiou to be Supernatural, yet will they only prove that it comes from wicked Daemons, or Evil Spirits, and not from a God of Purity and Holine&s;s, and &s;o will by no means prove it Divine, or worthy of our Reception. But then it is, for the main, &s;o well known, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> In&s;titutions do agree to the Divine Attributes, and do tend to Purity, Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice, and Charity; and are oppo&s;ite to all Immorality, Prophanene&s;s, and Idolatry, that I think there will not need much Examination in &s;o clear a Ca&s;e; and that, by Con&s;e|quence, our main Enquiry is to be as to the Truth of the Facts thereto relating. And in
<PB N="xxx" REF="32">
this Ca&s;e, I fear not to Invite all our Scep|ticks and Unbelievers, to u&s;e their greate&s;t Nicety, their entire Skill, their &s;hrewde&s;t Abilities, and their utmo&s;t Sagacity in this Enquiry; being well a&s;&s;ur'd from my own Ob|&s;ervations in this Matter, That the proper Re&s;ult of &s;uch an exact Hi&s;torical Enquiry will be as plainly and evidently on the Side of <HI>Reveal'd,</HI> as I have demon&s;trated in this Treati&s;e, that Philo&s;ophy and Mathematicks are on the Side of both <HI>Natural and Reveal'd Religion</HI>.

<P N="1">1._EVERY Body per&s;everes in its own pre&s;ent State, whether it be that of Re&s;t, or uniform direct Motion; unle&s;s it be compelled by &s;ome Force impre&s;s'd, to change that State.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="2" REF="36">(2.) All Motion is of it &s;elf Rectilinear.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) All revolving Bodies endeavour to re|cede from the Center of their Motion; and by how much the Motion is the &s;wifter, this En|deavour is the greater.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The Mutation of Motion is proportional to the moving Force impre&s;s'd; and is accord|ing to the Direction of that Line along which that Force is impre&s;s'd.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) Re-action is always contrary and equal to Action. That is, the Actions of two Bo|dies acting upon each other, whether they be Impul&s;es or Attractions, are always in oppo&s;ite Directions, and are al&s;o equal.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) If of two equal Bodies, void of Ela&s;ti|city, one of them which is in Motion meets the other at re&s;t, upon the meeting they will both proceed forwards together, to the &s;ame Part, with half the Velocity of the Body which was moved.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) If two equal Bodies, void of Ela&s;ticity, do directly meet each other with the &s;ame Ve|locity, they upon the Colli&s;ion will both of them re&s;t.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) If two unequal Bodies, de&s;titute of Ela|&s;ticity, meet one another with &s;uch Velocities, that by how much the greater exceeds the other in Magnitude, by &s;o much it is exceeded by the le&s;&s;er in Swiftne&s;s, &s;o that the Velocities are re|ciprocal to the Bodies; they will both re&s;t after that meeting.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) If a moving Body &s;trike another at re&s;t, (but both void of Ela&s;ticity) how unequal &s;o|ever they be in Bulk and Quantity of Matter, they will both move after the Shock with the &s;ame Velocity towards the &s;ame Parts, as in the
<PB N="3" REF="37">
&s;ixth Law: And the common Velocity will be &s;o much le&s;s than the fir&s;t, as both the Bodies together are greater than the Body fir&s;t mo|ved.</P>
<P N="10">(10.) If two unequal Bodies, void of Ela&s;ti|city, which are moved with equal Velocity to oppo&s;ite Parts, hit again&s;t one another, the Quan|tity of Motion in both, taken together after the Colli&s;ion, will be the <HI>Difference</HI> only of the former Motions.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) If two equal Bodies, void of Ela&s;tici|ty, be mov'd with unequal Velocity towards the &s;ame Part, upon their Colli&s;ion there will remain the &s;ame Quantity or <HI>Sum</HI> of their Mo|tions; but the common Velocity will be only the Half of both the former Velocities put to|gether.</P>
<P N="12">(12.) If two unequal Bodies, void of Ela|&s;ticity, the greater overtakes the le&s;&s;er, the common Velocity, after the Shock, will be greater than half the Sum of the former Velo|cities. And on the contrary, it will be le&s;s when the le&s;&s;er Body overtakes the greater.</P>
<P N="13">(13.) If a Body perfectly Ela&s;tic da&s;heth up|on another Body of the &s;ame &s;ort which is qui|e&s;cent and equal; after the Colli&s;ion the Motion will be wholly transferr'd into that which was quie&s;cent before, and with the &s;ame Celerity; but the Body which was mov'd before, will now re&s;t.</P>
<P N="14">(14.) If two Bodies perfectly Ela&s;tic, which are equal, but mov'd with an unequal Celerity, da&s;h one upon another, they, whether they were before carried to the &s;ame Part, or to the con|trary, will, after the Contact, be mov'd each with that Celerity which the other had before.</P>
<P N="15"><PB N="4" REF="38">(15.) Any Body, how great &s;oever, will be moved by any Body, how &s;mall &s;oever, coming with any Velocity what&s;oever.</P>
<P N="16">(16.) When two Bodies, perfectly Ela&s;tical, are da&s;h'd one upon the other, they depart from one another with the &s;ame Celerity where|with they approach'd one to the other; that is, not with the &s;ame <HI>ab&s;olute</HI>, but <HI>relative</HI> Celerity.</P>
<P N="17">(17.) If two Bodies perfectly Ela&s;tical, do each return to the Impul&s;e with the &s;ame Cele|rity wherewith they rebounded from it; they will each of them, after the &s;econd Impul&s;e, acquire the &s;ame Celerity as they had before the fir&s;t Meeting.</P>
<P N="18">(18.) If two Bodies meet one another, whe|ther they be Ela&s;tic or not Ela&s;tic, there doth not always remain the &s;ame Quantity of Moti|on as was before, but it may be greater or le&s;s.</P>
<P N="19">(19.) If a Body perfectly Ela&s;tical, which is greater, hits upon a le&s;&s;er one which is quie&s;|cent, it will give a Velocity to it le&s;s than the double of its own.</P>
<P N="20">(20.) If two Bodies perfectly Ela&s;tic, the Ce|lerities whereof are in reciprocal Proportion to their Magnitudes, meet one another directly and oppo&s;itely, they will both rebound with the &s;ame Celerity with which they came to each other.</P>
<P N="21">(21.) The Celerity which a great Body per|fectly Ela&s;tic, gives to a le&s;&s;er perfectly quie&s;|cent, which is al&s;o perfectly Ela&s;tic, hath that Proportion to that Velocity, which the le&s;&s;er moved with the like Celerity gives to the great|er when quie&s;cent, which the Magnitude of the greater hath to the Magnitude of the le&s;s.</P>
<P N="22"><PB N="5" REF="39">(22.) Every Body will in the &s;ame time de|&s;cribe the Diagonal of a Parallelogram with Forces conjunct, that it would do the Sides with tho&s;e Forces &s;eparate.</P>
<P N="23">(23.) All compound Forces and Motion what|ever may be reduc'd into innumerable other di|rect Forces and Motions; and on the contrary, all direct Forces, and rectilinear Motions, may be &s;uppos'd to be compounded of innumerable oblique Motions and Forces.</P>
<P N="24">(24.) The Quantity of Motion which is col|lected, by taking the Sum of the Motions to the &s;ame Part, and the Difference of tho&s;e to the contrary Parts, is not chang'd by the Acti|ons of Bodies one upon another.</P>
<P N="25">(25.) The common Center of Gravity of a Sy&s;tem of Bodies doth not change its State ei|ther of Motion or Re&s;t, from the Actions of the Bodies among&s;t them&s;elves, (whether they be Attractions or Impul&s;es;) and therefore the common Center of Gravity of all Bodies act|ing upon one another (Actions and Impedi|ments, whether external or otherwi&s;e ari&s;ing, being excluded) doth either re&s;t, or is mov'd uniformly &s;traight forwards.</P>
<P N="26">(26.) The Motions of two Bodies included in a given Space, and partaking of the Motion thereof, are the &s;ame among&s;t them&s;elves, wh$|ther that Space re&s;teth, or the &s;ame is mov'd uniformly &s;traight forward, without a Circular Motion.</P>
<P N="27">(27.) If Bodies be mov'd in any wi&s;e among&s;t them&s;elves, and be pre&s;&s;ed with equal accelera|tive Forces according to parallel Lines, they will all continue to be mov'd in the &s;ame manner among&s;t them&s;elves, as if they were not pre&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e Forces.</P>
</DIV3>

<PB N="6" REF="40">
<HEAD>PROPOSITIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="3">III. The Velocities of a Body accelerated by any uniform urging Force whatever, are betwixt them&s;elves, as the Times are wherein that uni|form Force is impre&s;s'd; that is, in double the Time double, in triple the Time triple, and in four times the Time quadruple.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The Lines which Bodies by any urging uniform Force do de&s;cribe, are in the duplicate Proportion of the Times, <HI>i. e.</HI> if the Times be Seconds, One, Two, Three, Four, Five, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the whole Lines de&s;crib'd will be among&s;t them&s;elves, as One, Four, Nine, Sixteen, Twenty-five, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are the Squares of the former.</P>
<P N="7">VII. In a Cycloid inverted, who&s;e Axis is crected perpendicular, the Times of the De|&s;cent wherein a Body let down from any Point whatever in it, comes to the lowe&s;t Point, are always equal betwixt them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. All Projectiles, not perpendicular to the Horizon, de&s;cribe Parabola's, &s;o far as they are not hindred by the Re&s;i&s;tance of the Air.</P>
<P N="9">IX. If two Bodies do in equal Times run over two whole unequal Circumferences, with an equable Motion, the centripetal Force in the greater Circumference will be to that which is in the le&s;s, as the Circumferences are one to another directly; or, which is the &s;ame, as their Diameters, or Radii.</P>
<P N="10">X. If two Bodies revolve in the &s;ame, or equal Circles with unequal Celerities, but both with
<PB N="7" REF="41">
an equable Motion, the centripetal Force of the &s;wifter will be to that of the &s;lower, in the Proportion of the Celerities duplicated; or as the Squares of the Arches de&s;cribed together.</P>
<P N="11">XI. If two Bodies revolve in unequal Circles with equal Velocity, their centripetal Forces will be in the reciprocal Proportion of their Circum|ference or Diameters; &s;o that in the le&s;&s;er Cir|cumference there will be the greater centripetal Force, and in the greater the le&s;&s;er.</P>
<P N="12">XII. If two Bodies be mov'd in unequal Circles, with an unequal Velocity, in the &s;ub|duplicate Proportion of the Circumferences, Diameters, or Radii, the centripetal Forces will be equal every where, and neither increas'd in the Acce&s;s nor Rece&s;s.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. If two Bodies be mov'd in unequal Circles, with an unequal Velocity, in the &s;ub|duplicate Proportion of the Circumferences, Dia|meters, or Radii, reciprocally; &s;o that in the greater Circle the Velocity be the le&s;&s;er, and in the le&s;&s;er Circle the greater, and this in the &s;aid &s;ub-duplicate reciprocal Proportion, the centripetal Force will be reciprocally as the Squares of the Radii or Di&s;tances.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. If two Bodies revolve in unequal Cir|cles with an unequal Celerity; &s;o that by how much greater the Radius, Diameter or Circum|ference is, &s;o much the le&s;s the Velocity is; and by how much the le&s;s the Radius is, &s;o much the greater is the Velocity, and this in the reci|procal Proportion of the Radii, the centripetal Forces will be as the Cubes of the Radii reci|procally.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The Area's, which revolving Bodies do de&s;cribe by Radii drawn unto the unmovable
<PB N="8" REF="42">
Center of Force acting upon them, do both lie in immovable Planes, and are proportional to the Times; and &s;o in any given Time are eve|ry where equal; the Velocity of Motion in the le&s;&s;er Di&s;tance, and the Slowne&s;s thereof in the greater &s;o tempering the De&s;cription of the Area's, that from tho&s;e various Di&s;tances no Difference of the Spaces run over in the given Time doth ever ari&s;e.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Every Body which is mov'd in a Curve Line, and doth by a Radius drawn to &s;ome Point, either immovable, or going forwards uniformly with a Rectilineal Motion, de&s;cribe Area's about that Point proportional to the Times; is urged or impre&s;s'd by a centripetal Force tending to the &s;ame Point.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. If a Body be mov'd in an Ellip&s;is about the Center of the &s;ame, the centripetal Force will be directly as the Di&s;tance of the Body from the &s;ame Center.</P>
<P N="20">XX. If a Body be mov'd in a Spiral Line, which cuts all the Radii in the &s;ame Angle, the centripetal Force will be reciprocally as the Cube of the Di&s;tance from the Center of the Spiral.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. If a Body be mov'd in an Ellip&s;is or Pa|rabola, or Hyperbola, about its Focus, the cen|tripetal Force will be every where in the dupli|cate Proportion of the Di&s;tance from the &s;ame Focus reciprocally.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. The Velocity of a Body moving in a Parabola about a Body placed in the Focus, the Force whereof is in the reciprocal duplicate Pro|portion of the Di&s;tances, is every where to the Velocity of a Body revolving in a Circle in the &s;ame time, in the &s;ubduplicate Proportion of
<PB N="9" REF="43">
the Number, Two to Unity; or as the Diago|nal of a Square to its Side; that is, as 10 to 7 nearly.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. Two Bodies attracting one another, de&s;cribe like Figures both about the Common Center of Gravity, and about one another; that is, whil&s;t they really de&s;cribe like Figures about the Common Center of Gravity, the Eye being placed in either of the two, and not perceiving its own Motion, or that of the Center of Gra|vity, a Figure like to the &s;ame will thereby &s;eem to it to be de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. If a primary Planet revolving about the Sun carry a Moon along with it, this will be &s;o mov'd about the Primary, that it will per|petually be accelerated from the Quadrature with the Sun, unto the Conjunction or Oppo&s;ition next following; but from the Conjunction to the Quadrature, it will be retarded; and con&s;e|quently will be carried more &s;wiftly about the Conjunction and Oppo&s;ition, but more &s;lowly about the Quadratures.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. The ab&s;olute Force of the Sun in the di&s;turbing the Secondary Planets, and the Effects thereof, in divers Di&s;tances from the Sun, is in the triplicate Proportion of tho&s;e Di&s;tances inver&s;ly.</P>
<P N="41">XLI. If a Fluid be contain'd in a Channel form'd in the Surface of any Planet, Primary or Secondary, and be uniformly revolv'd together with the Planet with a diurnal periodic Motion; each Part of this Fluid will be accelerated and retarded by turns; in its Conjunction and Op|po&s;ition, or at Noon-day and Midnight, it will be &s;wifter; in the Quadratures, or at the 6th Hour Evening and Morning, it will be &s;lower
<PB N="10" REF="44">
than the contiguous Surface of the Globe; and thus there will be a flux and reflux in the Chan|nel, by turns perpetually.</P>
<P N="42">XLII. If a Solid Ring be put about a Globe perfectly &s;pherical, at the Equator of the &s;ame, and &s;tick to it; there will indeed be no Motion of Flux and Reflux, but the vibrating Motion of Inclination, and the Prece&s;&s;ion of the Nodes, will remain. Let the Globe have the &s;ame Axis with the Ring, and compleat its Revolution in the &s;ame time; and with its Surface touch the Ring inwardly, and cleave to it; by its par|ticipating of the Motion thereof, the whole Frame will vibrate to and fro, and the Nodes will go back.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. If towards each equal Points of a Sphe|rical Phy&s;ical Surface of equal Thickne&s;s every where, but which Thickne&s;s is &s;o &s;mall that it is not to be regarded, there be a Tendency of equal Centripetal Forces decrea&s;ing in the du|plicate Proportion of the Di&s;tances from the &s;ame Points; any Corpu&s;cle placed any where within this Surface, will not be attracted unto any Part by the &s;aid Force; but will either re&s;t, or continue that Motion which is begun with|out any Di&s;turbance, and in the &s;ame manner as if it were acted upon with no Force at all from that Surface: And the ca&s;e is the &s;ame in any Spherical concave Space within a &s;olid Sphere, about its Center.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. If unto each Point of &s;ome given Sphere, which is Homogeneous, or of equal Den|&s;ity every where, there be a Tendency of equal Centripetal Force decrea&s;ing in the duplicate Proportion of the Di&s;tances from the points; a Corpu&s;cle placed within the Sphere, is attracted
<PB N="11" REF="45">
with a Force proportional to its Di&s;tance from the Center thereof.</P>
<P N="59">LIX. If the Den&s;ity of a Fluid compos'd of Particles which do flee from each other, be as the Compre&s;&s;ion; &s;o that if the pre&s;&s;ing Force be two, or four, or eightfold, the Den&s;ity thence ari&s;ing is &s;o likewi&s;e; the Centrifugal Force of the Particles is reciprocally proportional to the Di&s;tances from the Center: And, <HI>vice vers&acirc;</HI>, where the &s;aid Force is reciprocally proportional to the Di&s;tances from their Centers, the Parti|cles which flee from each other compo&s;e an ela|&s;tic Fluid, the Den&s;ity whereof is proportional to the Compre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="60">LX. The Quantity of Matter in all Bodies, is exactly proportional to their Weight.</P>
<P N="62">LXII. Bodies mov'd with an unequal Velo|city in a very Subtle Fluid, are re&s;i&s;ted by the Fluid in the Duplicate Proportion of their Ve|locity.</P>
<P N="64">LXIV. As the Re&s;i&s;tance of Fluids in divers Velocities is in the duplicate Proportion of the Velocity; &s;o in divers Den&s;ities the Velocity be|ing given, it is in the direct Proportion of the Den&s;ity it &s;elf; but the Den&s;ity and Velocity being given, in the duplicate Proportion of the Diameters; and con&s;equently the Re&s;i&s;tance in general is in a Proportion compounded of the duplicate Proportion of the Velocity, and the duplicate Proportion of Diameters, and the &s;imple Proportion of the Den&s;ity of the Medi|um directly.</P>
<P N="67">LXVII. If a &s;olid Cylinder, infinitely long, be revolv'd in an uniform and infinite Fluid about its own Axis, the Po&s;ition whereof is gi|ven, and the Fluid be mov'd round by the Im|pul&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="46">
of this Cylinder only; and every Part of the Fluid per&s;everes uniformly in its Motion; the periodic Times of the Fluid will be as their Di&s;tances from the Axis of the Cylinder di|rectly; and the Velocities will be every where equal.</P>
<P N="68">LXVIII. If a &s;olid Sphere, in an uniform and infinite Fluid, be revolv'd uniformly about its own Axis, the Po&s;ition whereof is given; and by the Impul&s;e of this alone the Fluid be turned round, and every part of the Fluid per|&s;everes uniformly in its Motion; the periodic Times of the Parts of the Fluid will be as the Squares of the Di&s;tances from the Center of the Sphere.</P>
<P N="69">LXIX. The Velocities of all the Planets, whether Primary or Secondary, about their Central Bodies, by being in the reciprocal &s;ub|duplicate Proportion of the Di&s;tances from their Centers, do wholly overthrow the <HI>Carte&s;ian</HI> Hy|pothe&s;is of Vortices.</P>
<P N="70">LXX. The Six Primary Planets, each with its own Satellites, where they have any, encom|pa&s;s the Sun with their Orbs, and revolve about it.</P>
<P N="71">LXXI. The periodic Times of the &s;ix Prima|ry Planets, are in the &s;e&s;qui-alteral Proportion of their mean Di&s;tances from the Sun.</P>
<P N="72">LXXII. The &s;ix Primary Planets do always, by Rays drawn to the Sun, de&s;cribe equal Areas in equal Times, and in general Areas pro|portional to the Times.</P>
<P N="73">LXXIII. The Moon, by Rays drawn to the Center of the Earth, de&s;cribes in equal Times Areas almo&s;t equal; and in general, Areas al|mo&s;t proportional to the Times.</P>
<P N="74"><PB N="13" REF="47">LXXIV. The Satellites of <HI>Jupiter</HI> do, by Rays drawn to the Center of <HI>Jupiter</HI>, de&s;cribe Areas proportional to the Times: And their periodic Times are in the &s;e&s;qui-alteral Propor|tion of their Di&s;tances from the Center of their Primary.</P>
<P N="75">LXXV. The Satellites of <HI>Saturn</HI> do, by Rays drawn to the Center of <HI>Saturn</HI>, de&s;cribe Areas proportional to the Times: And their periodic Times are in the &s;e&s;qui-alteral Propor|tion of their Di&s;tances from the Center of their Primary.</P>
<P N="76">LXXVI. The Force whereby the Primary Planets are perpetually drawn back from right Lines, and retain'd in their Orbs, does re&s;pect the Sun; and is as the Squares of the Di|&s;tances from the Center of the Sun recipro|cally.</P>
<P N="77">LXXVII. The Force wherewith the Satel|lites of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Saturn</HI> are perpetually drawn back from right Lines, and retain'd in their Orbs, re&s;pect the Centers of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Saturn</HI> re&s;pectively; and is as the Squares of the Di&s;tances from tho&s;e Centers recipro|cally.</P>
<P N="78">LXXVIII. The Force wherewith the Moon is perpetually drawn back from a Rectilinear Motion, and retain'd in its Orb, re&s;pects the Center of the Earth; and is as the Squares of the &s;everal Di&s;tances from the &s;ame Center re|ciprocally.</P>

<HEAD>PART. II. A particular Account of the Sy&s;tem of the &V;niver&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Sun</HI>, that immen&s;e and amazing Globe of Fire, the Fountain of all the Light and Heat of the whole Planetary and Cometary World, is in Diameter 763,000 Miles, in Sur|face it contains 1,813.200,000.000 Square Miles, and in Solidity 23.000,000.000,000.000 Cubical Ones, in Magnitude 900.000, and in Quantity of Matter 230.000 Times as great as the Earth, tho' only a Quarter &s;o Den&s;e; and all Bodies weigh 24 Times as much on its Surface, as on the Surface of the Earth. It is &s;ituate near the Center of Gravity of the whole Sy&s;tem, and revolves in about 25 Days and a half round its own Axis. It has frequently Spots, and &s;ome|times brighter Parts &s;een upon its Surface, of va&s;t Dimen&s;ions; as if they were great burning Vulcanos, &s;ometimes clouded with Smoke, and &s;ometimes clear. Its Heat, on its own Surface
<PB N="15" REF="49">
is about 45000 Times as Inten&s;e as that on the Earth. All the Planets and Comets gravitate to the <HI>Sun</HI> in a duplicate reciprocal Proportion of their Di&s;tances from it, and are thereby retain|ed in their &s;everal Orbits. Their Periodical Times are in a &s;e&s;quiplicate or &s;e&s;quialteral pro|portion to their Di&s;tance; that is, the Tripli|cate or Cubes of the Di&s;tances, are as the Du|plicate or Squares of the periodical Times; and that to the greate&s;t Exactne&s;s po&s;&s;ible; which equally obtains in the &s;econdary Planets, with regard to their primary Ones al&s;o; and is the fundamental Law of the entire Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P><HI>Mercury</HI> is the neare&s;t to the <HI>Sun</HI> of all the known Planets. Its utmo&s;t Elongation from it, to an Eye on the Earth is but 28 Degrees, &s;o that it is but rarely &s;een by us. This Planet is in Diameter 4,248 Miles, in Surface it contains 55,000.000 of &s;quare Miles; and in Solidity 39.000,000.000 of Cubical Ones, &amp; is 32,000.000 Miles di&s;tant from the <HI>Sun</HI>, and de&s;cribes a ve|ry Eccentrical Ellip&s;is about it in le&s;s than 3 Months, or in 88 Days.

<P><HI>Venus</HI> is &s;omewhat higher in the Sy&s;tem, and &s;o has its utmo&s;t Elongation 45 Degrees. It is a larger Planet than <HI>Mercury</HI>, and comes &s;ome|times
<PB N="16" REF="50" MS="Y">
much nearer to us. It is our Morning and Evening Star by turns, and is the Brighte&s;t of the Heavenly Bodies to us, next the Moon, as ca&s;ting a vi&s;ible Shadow in the Dark, and &s;ometimes appearing in the very Day-time al&s;o. It is in a Diameter 7.900 Miles; in Surface it contains 200,000.000 of Square Miles; and in Solidity it is 264.000,000.000 of Cubical Ones; and is di&s;tant 59,000.000 from the Sun, and de|&s;cribes its Ellip&s;is about it in 7 Months and a half, or 225 Days. The Eccentricity of its Or|bit is but 7/1000 of its mean Di&s;tance from the Sun. It mo&s;t plainly thro' the Telle&s;cope ap|pears with Pha&s;es, and Horned like the Moon. No &s;econdary Planets have yet been di&s;covered about it&punc; yet has it a Diurnal Revolution on its own Axis in 23 Hours. It receives almo&s;t dou|ble the Light and Heat from the Sun which the Earth does; and appears very rarely as a Spot in the Sun al&s;o.</P>
<P>The <HI>Earth</HI> is the next Planet to <HI>Venus</HI>, and has the Moon for its &s;econdary Planet; the common Center of who&s;e Gravity de&s;cribes an Ellip&s;is about the Sun in one Year, or 365 Days and a Quarter, nearly; the Eccentricity of its Orbit is 17/1000 of its mean Di&s;tance from the Sun, in Surface it contains 200,000.000 of Square Miles, and in Solidity 266.000.000.000 of Cu|bical Ones, and is in Diameter 7.970 Miles, and is di&s;tant from the Sun 81,000.000 Miles. This Annual Motion is perform'd in the Eclip|tick, and is directed, as is that of all the Pla|nets, primary and &s;econdary, from <HI>We&s;t</HI> to <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>, or according to the Order of the Signs, and therefore cau&s;es the Sun to have an appa|rent Annual Motion the &s;ame way, and in the

&s;ame Plane; but as &s;till in the oppo&s;ite Point of the Ecliptick. It has al&s;o a Diurnal Rotation upon its own Axis from <HI>We&s;t</HI> to <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> in 24 Hours, and &s;o occa&s;ions an apparent Motion of all the Heavenly Bodies from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t</HI> in the &s;ame time. The Axis of the Diurnal Mo|tion is 23 Degrees and one half, oblique to that of the Ecliptick, which occa&s;ions the Varieties of <HI>Spring, Summer, Autumn</HI>, and <HI>Winter</HI>. It is in Figure an Oblate Spheroid, as having the Diameter of its Equator about 62 Miles longer than its Axis, on account of the Eleva|tion of the Equatorial and Depre&s;&s;ion of the Polar Regions, occa&s;ion'd by the centrifugal Force of the Diurnal Motion.</P>
<P><HI>Mars</HI> is &s;till higher in the Sy&s;tem, and looks more red and fiery than the re&s;t of the Planets. It takes a larger Circuit than the Earth, and &s;o comes to its Conjunction, Quadratures and Op|po&s;ition; and in &s;ome degree imitates the Pha|&s;es of the Moon, being &s;ometimes only Gib|bous, tho' it cannot be at all horned like the other. This Planet de&s;cribes its Ellip&s;is about the Sun in le&s;s than 2 Years, or in 687 Days. The Eccentricity of its Orbit is 93/1000 of its mean Di&s;tance from the Sun; it is in Diameter 4444 Miles; in Surface it contains 60,000.000 of &s;quare Miles; and in Solidity 44.000,000.000 of Cubical ones; and is di&s;tant from the Sun 123,000.000 Miles; it has no &s;econdary Pla|net that can be &s;een, but revolves about its own Axis in 24 Hours and 40 Minutes. The Quan|tity of Light and Heat it enjoys from the Sun is between one half and one third of what the Earth receives from it. It al&s;o appears to us upon the Earth to be &s;ometimes Direct, &s;ome|times
<PB N="18" REF="52">
Stationary, and &s;ometimes Retrograde in its Cour&s;e, as all the &s;uperior Planets mo&s;t remarkably do; which Appearances, their high|er Situation, and &s;lower Angular Motion, o$ longer Periods, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce, with|out the lea&s;t Alteration of their real progre&s;&s;ive Motion about the Sun all the while.</P>
<P><HI>Jupiter</HI>, the large&s;t of all the Planets, is much higher in the Sy&s;tem, and has four Satel|lites or Moons revolving about it; and all by their common Center of Gravity de&s;cribe a very great Ellip&s;is about the Sun. The Eccentricity of its Orbit is 48/1000 of its mean Di&s;tance from the Sun. It comes to its Conjunction, Quadratures, and Oppo&s;ition, as well as <HI>Mars</HI>; but at &s;o great a Di&s;tance can never appear other than full, or nearly &s;o.

It revolves about its own Axis in 9 Hours and 56 Minutes, which make its Figure that of an Oblate Spheroid, ha|ving the Diameters of its Equator con&s;iderably longer than its Axis. The Quantity of Ligh$ and Heat it receives from the Sun is but one twenty-&s;eventh Part &s;o great as ours on the Earth. Its Quantity of Matter is about 22$ times &s;o great as that of the Earth. Its Den|&s;ity is about one fifth Part of the Earth's, and &s;o the Weight of all Bodies on its Surface is about double to that with us. It is al&s;o Direct, Stationary and Retrograde as <HI>Mars</HI>, but not in &s;o great a Degree. It has Belts, like Clouds&punc;

<P><HI>Saturn</HI>, the highe&s;t and mo&s;t remote of all the known Planets, has five Satellites or Moons, and a va&s;t but thin Ring encompa&s;&s;ing his Bo|dy, as an Horizon does a Globe; all which, or rather the common Center of their Gravity, de|&s;cribes an Ellip&s;is about the Sun. The Eccen|tricity of its Orbit is 55/1000 of its mean Di&s;tance from the Sun. It comes to its Conjunction, Quadratures and Oppo&s;ition, as well as the two former, but with no vi&s;ible Decrea&s;e of its Light at its Quadratures, which is &s;carce to be expected at &s;o great a Di&s;tance. It revolves about the Sun in about 29 Years and a half, or about 10.760 Days. It is in Diameter 68.000 Miles; in Surface it contains 14.000,000.000 of Square Miles, and in Solidity 160,000.000,000.000 of Cubical ones, at the mean Di&s;tance of 777,000.000 Miles from the Sun. Its Quan|tity of Matter is about 94 times as great as that of the Earth, tho' its Den&s;ity be only between a &s;ixth and a &s;eventh Part &s;o great as that of the Earth's; and the Weight of Bodies on its Surface is to that on the Surface of the Earth as about five to four. It is not yet certain|ly known to revolve about its own Axis, tho' its Ring is &s;aid to do &s;o. The Light and Heat communicated to it by the Sun are not quite the ninetieth Part &s;o great, as tho&s;e be&s;tow'd on the Earth.

<P><PB N="20" REF="54">Of the <HI>Satellites</HI>, or <HI>&s;econdary Planets</HI>; the mo&s;t eminent as to us is the <HI>Moon</HI>.

The mean Eccentricity of its Orbit is 55/1000 of its mean Di&s;tance from the Earth. It makes a Lunation or Synodical Month in 29 Days 12 Hours 44 Minutes. At a Mean it is di&s;tant from the Earth about 240,000 Miles, tho' with con&s;iderable Difference on account of its great Eccentricity. The Moon's Diameter is 2175 Miles; in Surface it contains 14,000.000 of Square Miles; and in Solidity 5.000,000.000 of Cubical ones. It has between the 39^t^h and 40^t^h Part of the Quantity of Matter of the Earth; its Den&s;ity is to that of the Earth as about 5 to 4, whil&s;t the Weight of all Bodies is but about a third Part &s;o great on its Surface, as on that of the Earth. It revolves from <HI>We&s;t</HI> to <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> upon its own Axis, exactly in a perio|dical Month, and thereby turns in general the &s;ame Face towards the Earth continually; yet does the Inequality of its Motion, and the Ob|liquity of its Axis, occa&s;ion &s;ome unequal <HI>Li|brations</HI> here al&s;o. It has very high Mountains, and very deep regular Valleys, and has lately had an Atmo&s;phere di&s;cover'd about it; nor does it &s;eem unlike the Earth as to Sea and Land. It has all Variety of Pha&s;es, according to its various Po&s;ition with re&s;pect to the Sun, or according as we on the Earth can &s;ee the whole, the half, or only &s;ome Part of its en|lighten'd Hemi&s;phere.

are each half a &s;ynodical Month, or near 15 of our Days long. Its Orbit is inclin'd to that of the Ecliptick, at the lea&s;t in an Angle of 5 Degrees; &s;o it but &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;es ju&s;t between the Sun and Earth at the new Moon, and but &s;ometimes falls into the Earth's Conical Shadow at the Full.

Nor is it improbable, that the large Interval between the fourth and fifth may have a &s;ixth, which is yet to us invi&s;ible, as <HI>Hugenius</HI> conje|ctures.

Yet by pa&s;&s;ing through the Planetary Re|gions in all Planes and Directions, they fully prove tho&s;e Spaces to be de&s;titute of Re&s;i&s;tance or &s;olid Matter, and &s;eem fit to cau&s;e va&s;t Mu|tations in the Planets, particularly in bringing on them Deluges and Conflagrations, according as the Planets pa&s;s through their Atmo&s;pheres, in their De&s;cent to, or A&s;cent from the Sun; and &s;o &s;eem capable of being the In&s;truments of Di|vine Vengeance upon the wicked Inhabitants of any of tho&s;e Worlds; and of burning up, or perhaps, of purging the outward Regions of them in order to a Renovation. This, I mean, &s;eems likely to be their U&s;e in the pre&s;ent State; tho' indeed they do withal &s;eem at pre&s;ent <HI>Chaos</HI>'s or Worlds in Confu&s;ion, but capable of a Change to Orbits nearer Circular, and then of &s;ettling into a State of Order, and of becoming fit for Habitation like the Planets; but the&s;e Conje|ctures are to be left to farther Enquiry, when it plea&s;es the Divine Providence to afford us more Light about them. However, in my <HI>Solar Sy&s;tem</HI> I have de&s;crib'd the Orbits of all the Comets that Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> has put into his Catalogue, and that in the Order of their Nearne&s;s to the Sun, at their <HI>Perihelia</HI>, and as they are in their proper Planes, without any Reduction to the Ecliptick.

<P>As to the <HI>Fixed Stars</HI>, they are va&s;tly remote from this our Planetary and Cometary Sy&s;tem, but may perhaps every one be the Center of ano|ther &s;uch like Sy&s;tem.

But of &s;uch va&s;t and numberle&s;s Sy&s;tems, if &s;uch they are, we know very little: Only &s;o much we know of the Planetary and Cometary Worlds, and of the Probability of va&s;tly more among the Fixed Stars (to &s;ay nothing of the noble&s;t or invi&s;ible Parts of the Creation, nor of the par|ticular Phaenomena here below) as is &s;ufficient to make us cry out with the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, O Lord, how manifold are thy Works!

When once we are &s;atisfyed of the Ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;uch a procedure in one Ca&s;e, we may begin to think of allowing the like Ju&s;tne&s;s in the other; but not &s;ooner.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) There are no mechanical Laws of Moti|on known in the World, which can account for &s;uch a Diurnal Revolution of the Heavens; nay, it is directly contrary to all &s;uch known Laws what&s;oever. 'Tis true, a Clock or Machine may have &s;everal di&s;tinct Motions within, and yet a Spectator may turn the whole round on its Axis at the &s;ame time; becau&s;e all the Parts and Wheels are connected together, and take hold of each other, by material contact and in&s;er|tion: So that he who removes one part, does of nece&s;&s;ity remove all the re&s;t. But this is far from the real Ca&s;e in the World about us; where the &s;everal Bodies are va&s;tly remote from, and unconnected with each other; and where there|fore no &s;uch (imaginary) Revolution of any (fictitious) <HI>Primum Mobile</HI>, or material external Sphere can affect or move the &s;everal Bodies therein contain'd. When once we &s;ee the Revo|lution of a large Wheel make other inward Wheels, which it does not touch, dance atten|dance thereto, and commence circular Revolu|tions

<P N="3">(3.) There is no Example of &s;uch Periodica$ Revolutions, which carry different and &s;eperate Bodies round the &s;ame Axis, in the &s;ame time, in the whole World about us.

<P N="4">(4.) The frequent, if not con&s;tant, Diurnal Revolutions of the re&s;t of the Heavenly Bodies, renders it mo&s;t highly rational, if not nece&s;&s;ary, to allow the like Revolution to our Earth.

Nor is it any way certain, that either <HI>Saturn</HI>, or <HI>Mercury</HI>, the &s;econdary Planets, the Comets, or fixed Stars, <HI>i. e.</HI> that any of the Heavenly Bodies are de&s;titute of &s;uch a Motion.

<HEAD><HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> of the <HI>Fourth Part;</HI> that this Gravity is the &s;ame in all Places, and at all Times, and with regard to all Bodies what&s;o|ever.</HEAD>
<P>This is plain from Fact and Ob&s;ervation; for (1.) Heavy Bodies fall as fa&s;t in one Country as in another; and Gravity affects the Planets and Comets in its proper Proportion, equally in all the Parts of the Univer&s;e where Planets or Co|mets go, <HI>i. e.</HI> in all the immen&s;e Regions of it every Way.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Planets and Comets, guided by this Law, have invariably pre&s;erv'd their Motions, Orbits, Periods, and Influences, &s;ince the fir&s;t Ages of A&s;tronomy and Chronology: And,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) This Gravity does &s;till, upon Tryal, equally affect Fluids and Solids; Bodies in Mo|tion and at Re&s;t; Great and Small; and this through the whole Univer&s;e al&s;o, &s;o far as we can examine it.</P>

<PB N="45" REF="81">
<HEAD><HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> of the <HI>Fifth Part;</HI> that this Gravity is an entirely immechanical Power, and beyond the Abilities of all material Agents what&s;oever.</HEAD>
<P N="1">(1.) This Power acts upon the very inward &s;ub&s;tantial Parts of Bodies, as well as the out|ward and vi&s;ible;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math. Philo&s;. <HI>Prop.</HI> 82.</NOTE> and is proportionable not to the Surface but to the &s;olid Content, or Quan|tity of Matter contained in them: Whereas, all Mechanical Cau&s;es are meerly &s;uperficial, and act by External Contact on the External Surface only.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) This Power acts upon Bodies equally, when they are in the mo&s;t violent Motion, and when they are at Re&s;t; as the Celerity of De|&s;cending Bodies with us;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math.

Now this is ab|&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible; that any Mechanical Pre&s;|&s;ure, or Impul&s;e from a Body, let its Motion be never &s;o &s;wift, or its Pre&s;&s;ure never &s;o &s;trong, &s;hould equally accelerate another Body, when at Re&s;t, and when in Motion;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math.

<P N="3">(3.) By this Power Bodies act upon other Bodies <HI>at a Di&s;tance</HI>, nay at all Di&s;tances what|&s;oever; that is, they <HI>act where they are not:</HI> Which is not only impo&s;&s;ible for Bodies Mecha|nically
<PB N="46" REF="82">
to do, but indeed is impo&s;&s;ible for all Beings what&s;oever to do, either Mechanically or Immechanically, it being ju&s;t as good Sen&s;e to &s;ay, an Agent can act <HI>when</HI> he is not in Be|ing, as <HI>where</HI> he is not pre&s;ent. Whence, by the way, as we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter, it will ap|pear, that this Power of Gravity is not only Immechanical, or does not ari&s;e from Corpore|al Contract or Impul&s;e, but is not, &s;trictly &s;peak|ing, any Power belonging to Body or Matter at all; tho' for ea&s;e of Conception and Calcula|tion we u&s;ually &s;o &s;peak; but is a Power of a &s;uperior Agent, ever moving all Bodies after &s;uch a manner, as if every Body did Attract, and were Attracted by every other Body in the Univer&s;e, and no otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>N.

<P>The&s;e Di&s;tances, as to their Proportion, are well known from plain Trigonometry; I mean, by the utmo&s;t Elongation of the Inferiors; where in a Rectanglar Triangle, joining the Eye, the Center of the Sun, and the Center of the Planet, two of the Sides bear this Proportion to each other: And by the Angle of Retrogradation thereto equivalent, in the Superiors; for 'tis but imagining your Eye, transferr'd to the Su|perior Planet, and the Earth is an Inferior one with re&s;pect to the Eye, and the Proportion as before is given; as al&s;o by the Po&s;ition of <HI>Ju|piter</HI>'s Shadow in the Eclip&s;es of its <HI>Satellits</HI>, where the Middle of the Eclip&s;e gives the Po|&s;ition of the Central Shadow of <HI>Jupiter</HI> from the Sun; and our In&s;truments give the Po&s;ition hence: So that we have all the Angles in a plain Triangle made by the Center of the Sun, the Center of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Shadow, and the Eye, which gives the Proportion of the Sides, or of the Di&s;tances; and by the Proportion of the Periodick Times, compar'd with the mean Di|&s;tances in the Comets, all which Methods agree together in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. And as to the Di|&s;tances in Miles them&s;elves, they are derived from the be&s;t Ob&s;ervations of the Parallax of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI>, by Mr. <HI>Flam&s;teed, Ca&s;&s;ini</HI>, and others, which give us that of the Sun about 10", and which is followed by Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton</HI> in the &s;econd Edition of his <HI>Principia</HI>. On|ly we may Note, that this Parallax cannot be

much larger, becau&s;e that would ea&s;ily be di&s;|cover'd by our In&s;truments, but may be a little le&s;s, becau&s;e that is more difficult to be found out. So that it is more probable that the&s;e Di|&s;tances are &s;omewhat too little, than that they are at all too great. But as to &s;uch farther Ex|actne&s;s, it mu&s;t be left to the nice&s;t Ob&s;ervati|ons of Po&s;terity.

The way of di&s;covering this Quantity is ea&s;y, from what has been already proved, that the univer&s;al Power of Gravitation is in proportion always to the Quantity of Mat|ter in each attracting Body. For if from the con&s;tant Equality of Proportion there is be|tween the Cubes of the Di&s;tances and the Squares of the Periods, we, by the Rule of Three, re|duce the &s;everal Sy&s;tems of the Planets to any one Di&s;tance from their Central Bodies, and there Geometrically compute the Proportion of the Centripetal Power to each Central Body, which in that Ca&s;e is directly proportional to the Square of the Velocity of the Planet, we &s;hall have the Quantity of the Force of Gravity towards every one of them; and, by Con&s;e|quence, the Quantity of that Matter which oc|ca&s;ions the &s;ame, and is proportionable thereto. Fot Example; Let us reduce the Di&s;tance of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s innermo&s;t Planet from <HI>Jupiter</HI>, to the &s;ame Di&s;tance as the Earth has from the Sun; and ob&s;erve the Difference of their Preiods or Velocities in tho&s;e equal Circles, by this Rule; As the Cube of the <HI>Satellits</HI> real Di&s;tance 230.000 &equals; 12.167,000.000,000.000, to the Cube of its imaginary Di&s;tance 81,000.000&equals;531.441, 000.000,000.000,000.000; &s;o is the Square of its real Period in Minutes 2548, at its pre&s;ent Di|&s;tance from <HI>Jupiter</HI> 6492304, to 28357660311 2024 the Square of its imaginary Period at the
<PB N="59" REF="96">
&s;ame Di&s;tance from it, as the Earth has from the Sun; who&s;e Square Root therefore 16,839.733 is the Period of that <HI>Satellit</HI> there in Minutes. Now as the Squares of the&s;e Periods recipro|cally, which is as the Squares of their Velocities directly, <HI>i. e.</HI> as 276643388961 to 283586607 511289, or as 220 to 227500 nearly, &s;o are their Attractions towards their re&s;pective Central Bo|dies, and &s;o are the Quantities of Matter in tho&s;e Central Bodies; which was to be demon&s;trated: and &s;o for the re&s;t. By this Method we know the <HI>Sun</HI>'s, <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s, <HI>Saturn</HI>'s, and the <HI>Earth</HI>'s, Quantity of Matter. As for the <HI>Moon</HI>, this Me|thod cannot reach it; becau&s;e there are no Planets revolving about it. But then the Tides in our Ocean, ari&s;ing from the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon</HI>'s Influences, or the Water's Gravitation towards them; and the Spring Tides being the Effect of the <HI>Sum</HI> of their Forces, when they are united; while the Nepe Tides are owing to the <HI>Diffe|rence</HI> between them when they are oppo&s;ite; we gather from the Ob&s;ervation, made of tho&s;e Spring and Nepe Tides, what the Proportion of their Powers is at their different Di&s;tances; whence we compute what it would be at equal Di&s;tances; <HI>i. e.</HI> what Proportion there is be|tween the Quantity of their Matter re&s;pectively. Thus for Example; the highe&s;t Elevation of the Tide by the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon</HI>, at the Conjun|ction and Oppo&s;ition, is to its Elevation by the prevalence of the Moon over the Sun after the Quadratures, by the be&s;t Ob&s;ervations, as 5 &frac12; to 3 &frac12;. Whence it follows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Sir <HI>I|&s;aac New|ton</HI>'s Prin|cip. <HI>2</HI>d Edit. pag. <HI>426,-430.</HI></NOTE> that the Moon's Force is to the Sun's as 4 &frac12; to 1.

the &s;maller, as any one may ea&s;ily try, it follows from the proportion of the <HI>Sum</HI>, to the <HI>Difference</HI> above &s;tated, 5 &frac12; to 3 &frac12;; that their &s;e|parate Forces mu&s;t be in the proportion ju&s;t now mentioned of 4 &frac12; to 1. Whence that Quan|tity of Matter in the Moon, which at its pro|per di&s;tance will bear this proportion of 4 &frac12; to 1 in the Elevation of our Tides and no other, mu&s;t be its true Quantity. By a Computation from which Principles, it appears that the Moon has little more than the 9,100.000th part of the Quantity of Matter in the Sun; or, which is all one, little more than the 40th part of the Quantity in the Earth, as this Table informs us. For if you &s;uppo&s;e the Sun as near as the Moon, its Force on the Tides will be &s;o much greater than that of the Moon, as its Magnitude is greater;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math. Philo&s;. <HI>Prop.</HI> 38. <HI>and pag.</HI> 9. prius.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> as about 9,100.000 is to 1, but then that Force being dimini&s;hed as the Cube of the Sun's greater Di&s;tance is increas'd, or nearly as the Cube of 337 &equals; 38,272.753 to 1; is upon the whole &s;o much more dimini&s;h'd than in|creas'd, that it amounts to only the 4 &frac12;th part of it; that being nearly the quotient of 38,272,753 divided by 9,100.000. By this means we are able to add the Moon's Quantity of Matter to that of the re&s;t of the foregoing Bodies. But &s;ince neither <HI>Mars, Venus, Mercury</HI>, nor any of the Comets, have any vi&s;ible Planets about them; nor do they &s;en&s;ibly affect our Tides; we have no means of knowing the Quantity of Gravitation towards them, and &s;o no means of knowing the Quantity of Matter contained in them.</P>

<P>Thus for Example: The Solid Space in the Earth is to that in the Moon, as the Cubes of their Diameters, or as 48 &frac12; to 1; but, as we have &s;een, the quantity of Matter in the Earth is to that in the Moon only, as 39 &frac12; to 1; whence it follows, that the Den&s;ity of the Moon compen&s;ates its &s;mallne&s;s, and is to that of the Earth as 48 &frac12; to 39 &frac12;, or as 123 &frac12; to 100, accord|ing to the Table before us; and the Ca&s;e is the very &s;ame in the re&s;t.</P>

<P>Thus for Example: The quantity of Matter in the Earth is to that in the Moon as 39 &frac12; to 1, and in the &s;ame proportion do all Bodies gravi|tate to them at equal Di&s;tances from their re|&s;pective Centers.

<P>The way by which the&s;e Diurnal Revolutions are di&s;covered in the <HI>Sun, Jupiter, Mars</HI>, and <HI>Venus</HI>, is obvious; I mean the Ob&s;ervations by Tele&s;copes of certain Spots in their Surfaces, and the Noting how long it is e'er tho&s;e Spots come round again. The Earth's Period is known from the apparent Motion of the Fixed Stars from any Meridian to the &s;ame again; which is a Periodi|cal Revolution, or Day. The Moon's diurnal Period is known from the Periodical Month, which is exactly equal thereto; otherwi&s;e the &s;ame &s;ide of the Moon would not be always turned to our Earth, as it certainly is; and that to &s;uch a degree of Nicety, that the Men&s;trual and Diurnal Motions of the Moon have not in the lea&s;t gain'd nor lo&s;t upon each other from the earlie&s;t Times of Ob&s;ervation: which is a thing exceeding remarkable, and what will be taken particular Notice of hereafter.</P>

<P>That the <HI>Moon</HI> has <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Night</HI>, is evident from the con&s;tant falling of the Sun's Light up|on one Hemi&s;phere of the Moon, and the re|moval of that Light, from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t</HI>, quite round it, in a Synodical Month, and is vi&s;ible to our Eyes; which Space is therefore equal to an entire <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which is 29d. 12h. 44&prime;. long by our Computations.</P>

of the A&s;tronomical Sy&s;tem of the Earth and Moon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Fig. <HI>VII.</HI></NOTE> but is directly vi&s;ible to our &s;elves al&s;o; it being clear that that Secondary Light which we commonly &s;ee in the dark part of its Body, for &s;everal Days before and after the New Moon, is no other than Light reflected to the Moon from our Earth, and thence reflected back to us again. Nor is this very &s;urprizing neither; &s;ince the Square of the Earth's Diameter is more than Thirteen times as great as that of the Moon; and by Con&s;equence the Light of the Earth is at the Moon in the &s;ame proportion grea|ter, than that of the Moon at the Earth.

Nor indeed do the primary ones them&s;elves afford us enow of them to determine in particular their own State, as to many &s;uch Matters. On|ly <HI>Jupiter</HI> affords us the Appearance of Belts, or movable Girdles, and be&s;ides them, his Satellites afford us that famous Phaenomenon of the Velocity of the Rays of Light: And <HI>Saturn</HI>, be&s;ides his Five Planets, affords us &s;uch a Ring encompa&s;&s;ing his Body, as &s;eems to be the mo&s;t &s;ingular and curious Spectacle in the whole Sy&s;tem.

at the &s;ame Time.

However, 'tis certain that this Di&s;tance is va&s;tly great, if compar'd with that of the Planets and Comets, when they are remote&s;t from the Sun; and that in particular the famous Comet of 575 Years Period, which goes &s;ome|times about 14 times as far off the Sun as <HI>Sa|turn, i. e.</HI> about 11.200,000.000 Miles, is not then near enough to them to be altered by that of the Fixed Stars Gravitation towards, or In|fluences from them. The&s;e Stars &s;eem to be of
<PB N="78" REF="119" MS="Y">
the &s;ame Nature with the Sun, as &s;hining with their own Native Light; and continuing fixed in the Centers of their &s;everal Planetary and Cometary Sy&s;tems, as the Sun does.</P>
<P N="17">(17.) The Fixed Stars &s;eem to be really of very different Magnitudes, yet not of &s;uch very different Di&s;tances from this Sy&s;tem as is now generally &s;uppo&s;ed. As to the fir&s;t A&s;&s;ertion, it &s;eems very agreeable to the re&s;t of the vi&s;ible Bodies in the World, whether Planets or Comets, which are of very different Magnitudes al&s;o; and &s;eems confirm'd from the &s;econd A&s;&s;ertion; for if the Fixed Stars vi&s;ible to the naked Eye be at no very different Di&s;tances from our Sy|&s;tem, that va&s;t apparent Inequality of Light which they &s;end hither, and according to which they are ranked under &s;ix or &s;even different Mag|nitudes on our Globes and Plani&s;pheres, will be next to a Demon&s;tration, that they are them|&s;elves really of very different Magnitudes al&s;o. Nor in that Ca&s;e will it be proper to place the Tele&s;copick Stars at any va&s;tly farther Di&s;tances, &s;ince they do not at all &s;eem different from the other, only &s;till gradually &s;maller. Now that the Fixed Stars, vi&s;ible to the naked Eye, are not at any very different Di&s;tances from our Sy&s;tem, is mo&s;t probable, becau&s;e the be&s;t Me|thod we yet have of knowing tho&s;e Di&s;tances, I mean their Parallax, determine that the Di|&s;tance of tho&s;e Three which have been try'd, tho' all of different apparent Magnitudes, is very nearly the &s;ame. I do not deny that &s;ome Fixed Stars may be va&s;tly farther off than others; and that there may be Sy&s;tems of Worlds &s;cattered every where in the Uni|ver&s;al Immen&s;e Void: But I &s;ay, that if far|ther
<PB N="79" REF="120">
Ob&s;ervations confirm this Parallax, and any &s;ort of Equality thereof, we mu&s;t accommodate our Opinions to our Evidence, and in that Ca&s;e mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that the grand Sy&s;tem them|&s;elves of Sun, Planets. Comets, and Fixed Stars are, like the Parts of &s;uch a Sy&s;tem, va&s;tly re|mote from each other; nay, perhaps, out of the reach of each others Di&s;covery al&s;o. But as to this noble Theory, we cannot be at all po|&s;itive till the Parallax and Di&s;tance of the Fixed Stars be more nicely ob&s;erv'd, and the A&s;tro|nomical World better &s;atisfy'd about it; the doing of which I would therefore earne&s;tly re|commend to the publick Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="18">(18.) Several of the&s;e Fixed Stars, e&s;pecially of the &s;maller &s;ort, do &s;ometimes di&s;appear, and new ones appear; and &s;ome of them do appear or di&s;appear, look Brighter or Duller by Turns; and this &s;ometimes after certain Intervals of Time al&s;o. This is a known Fact; and has in &s;ome mea&s;ure been noted from almo&s;t the earlie&s;t Ages of A&s;tronomy. But then, what &s;hould be the Cau&s;e of &s;uch mutable Appearances among the&s;e Fixed Stars, is by no means yet di&s;covered; nor have I hitherto ventur'd to propo&s;e any Conje|cture about them. However, &s;ince others have alteady begun their Hypothe&s;es, which &s;eem to me commonly either entirely precarious or ab&s;o|lutely impo&s;&s;ible, I &s;hall make bold here to offer my own, which &s;hall not only be free from &s;uch &s;trong Objections, but agreeable to the neare&s;t parallel Ca&s;e in the World. We know that the Sun it &s;elf, the only Fixed Star, as I may call it, that is &s;ufficiently within the reach of our Tele&s;copes, has &s;everal Times not a few <HI>Maculae</HI> or <HI>Spots</HI> upon his Body; which fre|quently
<PB N="80" REF="121">
become <HI>Faculae</HI>, or Parts brighter than the re&s;t; and which come and go by turns. How many there may po&s;&s;ibly be of the&s;e Spots at certain times we cannot &s;ay; but this is plain, that we do not know but &s;o many of them may &s;ometimes ari&s;e, as may, in good part, cover over the Sun's Surface, and render its Light and Heat very Weak and Dull. The&s;e Spots may be again di&s;&s;ipated, and become <HI>Faculae</HI>, or Brighter than ordinary. The&s;e <HI>Maculae</HI> and <HI>Faculae</HI> may &s;ometimes, by Turns, gain ground on one another, after certain Intervals of Time, and cau&s;e the Sun to grow Darker and Brighter periodically. Nay, we do not know, but the&s;e <HI>Maculae</HI> may &s;ometimes, e&s;pecially in Ca&s;e the Sun were &s;maller, cover over the greate&s;t Part of its Surface, &s;o as to extingui&s;h, or at lea&s;t to ob&s;cure its Light; which yet in Length of Time may be overcome, and the Sun may recover its former Splendor, if not one greater than that before. Since therefore &s;uch Phaeno|mena of the Fixed Stars are like what our Sun ap|pears by known Ob&s;ervations to be in &s;ome &s;ort liable to, I think it the be&s;t Guide, as to what we &s;ee to happen to others of them; and that the <HI>Maculae</HI> and <HI>Faculae</HI> of tho&s;e Stars may cau&s;e the&s;e &s;urprizing Appearances. Nor can I ea&s;ily think in any other manner, about tho&s;e &s;ix Spaces of Light, or Starry Mi&s;ts, which have been lately di&s;covered in the Heavens, than by Analogy to what we know of Things of a like Nature; <HI>viz.</HI> that they are a Company of very &s;mall Fixed Stars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tran&s;act.

<P N="1">(1.) _SINCE Matter is entirely a Pa&s;&s;ive Sub&s;tance; no &s;ponta|neous Motion or Action, even in Brutes, can be derived from it; much le&s;s can that Active and Free Being, the Soul of Man, be ju&s;tly &s;up|po&s;ed to be material.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Since Bodies once exi&s;ting will continue to exi&s;t, and that for ever, in the &s;ame State of Re&s;t, or uniform Motion, along &s;trait Lines, wherein they once are; at lea&s;t with the alone Concurrence of the Fir&s;t Cau&s;e; the Projectile Motions of the Heavenly Bodies require no new, or particular con&s;tant Acts of Power for their continuation in that State. But,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Since none of the Heavenly Bodies move uniformly in &s;trait Lines, but all of them rather unequally, and all in Curves, they are every one impell'd, and that perpetually, by &s;ome Exter|nal Power, Efficacy, Force, or Influence; and
<PB N="82" REF="123">
thereby are obliged to revolve in &s;uch Curves; which Power we have already proved to be that of Gravity,</P>
<P N="4">(4.) If that Power of Gravity were &s;u&s;pend|ed, all the whole Sy&s;tem would immediately di&s;&s;olve; and each of the Heavenly Bodies would be crumbled into Du&s;t; the &s;ingle Atoms com|mencing their &s;everal Motions in &s;uch &s;everal &s;trait Lines, according to which the projectile Motion chanc'd to be at the In&s;tant when that Influence was &s;u&s;pended or withdrawn.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) Since pendulous Bodies receive no &s;en&s;i|ble Re&s;i&s;tance in their Internal Parts; and &s;ince both the Planets and Comets move prodigiou&s;ly &s;wift, with the utmo&s;t Freedom, and without any &s;en&s;ible Re&s;i&s;tance through the Aethereal Re|gions, 'tis certain there is no <HI>Subtile Matter</HI> pervading the Univer&s;e, as &s;ome have &s;up|po&s;ed.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) All the Solutions, therefore, of the Phae|nomena of Nature, which depend on the Sup|po&s;ition of that <HI>Subtile Matter</HI>, are entirely fal&s;e, and contrary to the plain State of our <HI>Sy|&s;tem</HI>.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) To &s;uppo&s;e a <HI>Plenum</HI>, or that the Uni|ver&s;e is entirely full of &s;uch Subtile Matter, is utterly vain and ungrounded; nay, contrary to the mo&s;t certain Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) Since the particular Proportion ever ob|taining as to the Power of Gravity, I mean that of the Duplicate of the Nearne&s;s of Bodies, is not any nece&s;&s;ary Re&s;ult from the Nature of Matter, or any Laws of Motion in the World; it is plain that this Proportion is no way owing to any Mechanical Cau&s;e or Nece&s;&s;ity what&s;o|ever, but entirely to free Choice, Prudence and Judgment.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="83" REF="124">(9.) Since all Bodies are equally capable of Re&s;t, and of all Degrees of Velocity what&s;o|ever; but are in their own Nature no way de|termin'd to any of them; that nice Adju&s;tment there is of the projectile Velocity to the At|tractive Power through the whole Univer&s;e; whereby the Planets both primary and &s;econda|ry revolve nearly in Circles, and the Comets nearly in Parabola's, is no way owing to any Mechanical Cau&s;e, or Nece&s;&s;ity what&s;oever; but entirely to free Choice, Prudence, and Judg|ment.</P>

<HEAD>PART V. <HI>Probable Conjectures</HI> as to the Nature and &V;&s;es of all the Parts of the <HI>SYSTEM</HI> of the vi&s;ible World.</HEAD>
<P N="1">(1.)_THE Sun and Fixed Stars are, to be &s;ure, on their external Regions or &s;uperficial Parts, mo&s;t inten&s;e Fire or Light; and the grand Fountains of that Fire and Light which is in the whole vi&s;ible Univer&s;e, and without which there could be no &s;uch thing as a <HI>Vi&s;ible Univer&s;e</HI>, or U&s;eful Sy|&s;tem at all. So that there can be no doubt of the general Nature and U&s;e of tho&s;e external Regions. Nor perhaps &s;all we be far out of the way, if we &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e Parts of the Sun to be more than 10000 Planets or Comets all on Fire.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Planets, both Primary and Secon|dary, appear, as to their vi&s;ible external Regi|ons, or &s;uperficial Parts or Atmo&s;pheres, to be like to that Planet we live upon, the Earth; or mo&s;t convenient and well contrived Habitations for all &s;orts of Sea and Land, vi&s;ible and gro&s;s

Animals; with &s;uch Plants as are u&s;eful for any of their Pre&s;ervation and Su&s;tenance, du|ring their continuance thereon.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The Air expanded about the &s;everal Pla|nets, which, as to their Ela&s;tical Parts, are cor|poreal, but invi&s;ible, appear to be the proper Places for the Habitation of not wholly Incorpo|real, but Invi&s;ible Beings; or of &s;uch as have Bodies made of too &s;ubtle and aerial a Texture and Con&s;titution to be ordinarily &s;een by our Eyes, or felt by our Hands. And if it be con|&s;idered, that while all the ancient Prophane Traditions, and Hi&s;torical Accounts, as well as the Sacred Writings, which a&s;&s;ure us of the Exi&s;tence of &s;uch inv&s;ible Beings about our Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Prop. after my <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Lectures <HI>p 287&mdash; $97.</HI> or $rnt. &amp; $word$ <HI>p. 170, $78.</HI> Meteor, <HI>p. $8&mdash;72.</HI></NOTE> do at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ure us of their inhabiting in our Air, which is the only appa|rent Place, according to the be&s;t Philo&s;ophy, where &s;uch invi&s;ible Beings, not de&s;titute of all Bodies, can po&s;&s;ibly inhabit; it will ju&s;tly de|&s;erve our Con&s;ideration, whether this be not the noble&s;t De&s;ign and U&s;e of our Air; tho' at the &s;ame time its lowe&s;t Regions be an <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> al&s;o; or be u&s;eful in Re&s;piration, in Refracti|on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o fitted as to elevate and let fall the Vapours belonging to our Earth, for the Support of the Creatures, in gro&s;&s;er Bodies, in|habiting thereon.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The external Regions of Comets, which by pa&s;&s;ing through &s;uch immen&s;e Heat when neare&s;t, and &s;uch prodigious Cold when farthe&s;t off the Sun; and by the confu&s;ed and Chaotick State of their Atmo&s;pheres, do evidently appear incapable of affording convenient Habitations for any Beings that have Bodies, or Corporeal Ve|hicles, whether vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible to us; &s;eem
<PB N="93" REF="134">
rather fitted to cau&s;e the grand Mutations of Nature in the Planetary World;<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Theory, p. 437, 438. <HI>and</HI> p. 440, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> by bringing on <HI>Deluges</HI> in their De&s;cent, and <HI>Conflagrations</HI> in their A&s;cent from the Sun; as I have el&s;ewhere more fully Di&s;cour&s;ed.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) The&s;e Comets, with their Atmo&s;pheres and Tails, &s;eem al&s;o fitted, as to their external Regions, to be a very unea&s;y, hot, and fiery Habitation when near, and a very unea&s;y, cold, and chill one, when far off the Sun, and this both on their Surfaces, and in their Airs.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) As to the Internal Parts or Regions of the Sun, Planets, and Comets, they &s;eem to be Con|cave, and to include va&s;t open Spaces within. This Conjecture which is no way contrary to any other Phaenomena of Nature, I ground par|ticularly upon the &s;mall Inequality there is in Fact between the Polar and Equatorcal Semi-diameters of tho&s;e Heavenly Bodies which have diurnal Revolutions about their own Axes, com|pared with the much greater Inequality there would naturally be between them, if they had not &s;uch Central Cavities. For Example, If the internal Parts of the Earth were of the &s;ame Den&s;ity with the External, it is Demon&s;trated by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Princip. 2<HI>d Edit.</HI> p. 382&mdash; 387.</NOTE> that the Polar Semi-dia|meter or Axis would be about 17 Miles &s;horter than the Semi-diameter of the Equator. If the Central Parts were much Den&s;er than the re&s;t, (as on all mechanical Accounts they ought cer|tainly to be) the&s;e 17 Miles would be mighti|ly increas'd, and probably amount to &s;ome Hun|dreds. Yet is that Semi-diameter in Fact but about 31 Miles &s;horter than the other. Whence it is probable, that the greater Den&s;ity in the deeper Regions, is compen&s;ated by the le&s;&s;er
<PB N="94" REF="135">
Den&s;ity, or rather partial Cavity of the Central Regions them&s;elves. And this Rea&s;oning is &s;till va&s;tly &s;tronger in <HI>Jupiter</HI>; where the difference of Semi-diameters ought to be much more re|markable, and to amount to &s;ome thou&s;ands of Miles, while yet it is therein but ju&s;t &s;en&s;ible; and that only by the U&s;e of the be&s;t In&s;tru|ments and Ob&s;ervations we have in A&s;tro|nomy.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is not improbable therefore, that tho&s;e Central Cavities may be &s;o fitted by Providence, as to afford Habitations to &s;ome Creatures, as well as the external Surfaces, the Land, the Water, and the Air, have appear'd to do; tho' this in different Circum&s;tances, as to the diffe|rent Bodies, the Sun, the Planets, and the Co|mets. See Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>'s Conjecture to &s;omewhat the like Purpo&s;e, <HI>Tran&s;act. Philo&s;.</HI> N^o. 347. <HI>for A. D.</HI> 1716.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) If the Sun has &s;uch a Cavity for Habita|tion, it mu&s;t be fenced from the Heat of his more external Parts by a va&s;tly thick Wall or Partition;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See pag.</HI> 54. prius.</NOTE> which that there may be even of many thou&s;and Miles, the prodigious largene&s;s of its Diameter, and the little comparative depth of the penetration of Heat through &s;olid Earth, do Demon&s;trate. Nor would &s;uch a central Cavi|ty in the Sun be in danger of any pernicious Heat, tho' it were large enough to hold, on its inward Surface, as many Creatures as the exter|nal Surfaces of all the Planets and Comets put together could contain; as he that con&s;iders the Tables, <HI>pag.</HI> 54. and 56. before, will ea&s;ily believe. Perhaps &s;uch a Degree of Heat may be deriv'd from the outward to the inward Regions, as will &s;uit &s;ome of the Purpo&s;es of the Great
<PB N="95" REF="136">
Author of Nature therein: But then all its Light mu&s;t be deriv'd from &s;ome other Cau&s;e, than from the outward Parts of the Sun.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) If the Planets, or any of them, have &s;uch Cavities for Habitation; becau&s;e they keep nearly at the &s;ame Di&s;tance from the Sun, in the &s;everal Parts of their Cour&s;e, their Heat as well as Light, mu&s;t come mo&s;t probably from within al&s;o, as not being ever Recruited in their Revolutions.</P>
<P N="10">(10.) If the Comets, while they continue &s;uch, have the like Cavities for Habitation; Part of their Heat, becau&s;e of their Acce&s;s to the Sun every Period, may be derived from it, and recruited every Revolution: But then all their Light, as well as that of the re&s;t, mu&s;t be deriv'd from within al&s;o.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) That the Earth in particular has &s;uch a Cavity, &s;eems clear from Scripture, as well as it may be conjectured from A&s;tronomy. For when many, at lea&s;t, of the Souls departed out of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Gen. xxxvii.35. Num. xvi.3$, 3$. E$k. xxvi.20.xxxi.16. Rom. x.7.

<P N="11">(11.) If there be any &s;uch Cavities and Recep|ticles for living Creatures, and the Things ne|ce&s;&s;ary for their Su&s;tenance, in the Central
<PB N="96" REF="137">
Regions of the Sun, or of the Planets, or Co|mets, 'tis certain their State and Circum&s;tances mu&s;t be very different from tho&s;e on the Sur|faces of the Planets. They mu&s;t all live in Concave Spheres, which mu&s;t hinder all Inter|cour&s;e between them and this vi&s;ible World; Nor can they have any Philo&s;ophical Evidence that there is &s;uch an External World at all; which is the Ca&s;e of the re&s;t of this Univer&s;e, as to us, if we, with all the vi&s;ible Stars, Co|mets and Planets, be our &s;elves included in &s;uch a Cavity; which is not ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;uppos'd. But then, as to the particular Circum&s;tances of &s;uch Creatures, their way of Living, and the Cour&s;e of Nature and Provi|dence, and Divine Revelation relating to them, I &s;hall not venture here to propo&s;e any particular Conjectures about them; only hinting this, that the Power of Gravity from the External Parts being in this Ca&s;e none at all,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> Math.

<PB N="99" REF="140">
Con&s;equence of all that Phy&s;ical Knowledge of Matter or Body, which Ob&s;ervation and De|mon&s;tration leads us to. We can Philo&s;ophi|cally trace material Impul&s;e, and the material Images of External Objects, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, even in Brutes, through the Organs of Sen&s;e, up to the Brain, or the Fountain of Sen&s;ation and Action. But there Mechanical Cau&s;es end, and Material Effects cea&s;e; there that Agent or Sub|&s;tantial Being, which Sees, and Hears, and Feels, and Ta&s;tes, and Smells, and Joys, and Grieves, and Directs, and Moves, and Remem|bers, and Hopes, and Fears, is pre&s;ent, and di|rectly comes to be con&s;idered by us. But then it comes to be con&s;ider'd entirely as an Invi&s;ible or Immaterial Agent, or Sub&s;tance, different from the Eyes, and Ears, and Hands, or Feet, and Palate, and No&s;trils, and Nerves, and Brain, and Blood, and Animal Spirits of the Brute Creature; ju&s;t as we con&s;ider the Organi&s;t that guides and directs the Pipes, and Sounds, and Stops of his Organ, as entirely different from tho&s;e Pipes, and Sounds, and Stops them|&s;elves. Not that I pretend to tell of what par|ticular Kind or Sort of Sub&s;tance, that Sen&s;itive and Active Being is compos'd, either in Brutes, or in Men, or in any Superior, Invi&s;ible, and Intellectual Beings. That Sub&s;tance may be different in every different Kind. But that we $o &s;till ob&s;erve from their Phaenomena, that the&s;e Souls are different in their Properties and Actions, in almo&s;t all their Properties and Actions, not only from their own Gro&s;s Bodies, $ut in general from what we call Matter or Bo|$y, from all that we call Matter or Body in $he Univer&s;e. Immaterial they are indeed, and
<PB N="100" REF="141">
different from the Material Body, according to all the Notions and Experiments we ever have of the&s;e Brutes, and of Matter. But that does not directly inform us <HI>what</HI> they are, becau&s;e we know not what <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> is in general, nor what the par|ticular Sub&s;tances of any particular Material or Immaterial Being are. But by comparing the Properties of Matter, with tho&s;e of the Souls of even Brutes them&s;elves, we plainly and evi|dently perceive that tho&s;e Souls are not Matter. 'Tis true, we cannot determine how far the De|&s;truction of the gro&s;s Body of a Brute affects the Soul, or &s;en&s;itive Agent thereto united: We do not know whether tho&s;e Souls are Immortal or not: We do not know whether they utterly pe|ri&s;h with their Bodies; or whether they only continue in a kind of inactive in&s;en&s;ible State, till they actuate other Bodies again or no, and &s;o perpetually. And the Rea&s;on is plain, we have no way of knowing &s;uch Secrets of Nature and Providence, about Invi&s;ible Sub&s;tances, by Ob&s;ervation, or Experiment: And the Author o$ Nature has not been pleas'd to di&s;cover &s;uch Things to us, by Revelation. If I were to <HI>Gue&s;s</HI> where I cannot <HI>Know</HI>, I &s;hould imagine that all &s;uch Immaterial Souls do ever, by their peculiar Nature, perceive and feel whatever i$ pre&s;ent to them, and no more; and that they endeavour to act in a way &s;uitable to the Im|pre&s;&s;ions and Pa&s;&s;ions thereupon ari&s;ing in them and no farther: That therefore, when they a$ out of a Body, their Sen&s;ations are &s;o few and narrow, and there Powers &s;o &s;mall, that the$ are in a &s;ort of Sleep, Silence and Inactivity that when they are in Bodies, (which a$ mo&s;t wonderful Structures and Machines, con|triv'd

at once to convey the Impre&s;&s;ions of mo&s;t numerous, and even mo&s;t di&s;tant Objects to them, and to follow their Directions and Actions thereupon,) while tho&s;e Bodies keep in Order, tho&s;e Souls are alive, vigorous, and active; but when the Bodies are di&s;&s;olv'd, or their Contexture de&s;troy'd, their Souls return to their former State of Sleep, Silence, and In|activity: though without a real Annihilation; and &s;o without any Incapacity of Revival and Reactivity: I mean upon Suppo&s;ition, that the Author of Nature, or any of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters by whom he Governs the World, affords it another Opportunity for &s;uch a Revival and Reactivity again. This is, I &s;ay, what I &s;hould <HI>Gue&s;s</HI>, as to the State of the Immaterial Souls of Brutes, if I would indulge my &s;elf in &s;uch Uncertainties. And whether the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> does not favour &s;uch a <HI>Conjecture</HI>, where he &s;peaks thus, <HI>When God hideth his Face</HI> from &s;uch Creatures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. civ 29, 30.</NOTE> <HI>they are troubled: When he taketh away their Breath they die, and return to their Du&s;t: When he &s;endeth forth his Spirit they are Created, and He re|neweth the Face of the Earth:</HI> I &s;hall leave to the Readers Con&s;ideration. But as to the Pro|po&s;ition it &s;elf; I mean, that what perceives and acts even in Brutes, is a Being or Agent properly and entirely di&s;tinct from that Body in which it acts, and is truly a Being or Agent Immaterial; This I take to be the natural Re|&s;ult of Philo&s;ophick Rea&s;oning, from Fact and Experience: and by no means to be &s;et a&s;ide, becau&s;e we are not able to &s;olve all Difficulties thereto relating: Which we are rarely, or in|deed never capable of doing, in the la&s;t Re&s;ort in any part of Knowledge what&s;oever. But as
<PB N="102" REF="143">
to tho&s;e who, to avoid all &s;uch Difficulties, pre|tend that Brutes have no Souls, no Sen&s;ation, no Action of their own, and are meerly Corporeal Clock-work, and Machines; they yield me this Point, that if they have Souls, and do really Per|ceive and Act them&s;elves, tho&s;e Souls, tho&s;e Princi|ples of Sen&s;ation and Action, mu&s;t be Immecha|nical, and Immaterial: But then, they pretend to disbelieve that, which &s;eems to me almo&s;t as plainly matter of Fact and Ob&s;ervation, as any of Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Experiments what&s;oever. And I care not to an&s;wer &s;uch an extravagant Ob|jection, which it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to &s;up|po&s;e, that any &s;ober Propo&s;er can, in earne&s;t, believe him&s;elf in his own Propo&s;al of it. And when the Scripture a&s;&s;ures us, that a <HI>Righteous</HI> or <HI>Merciful Man regardeth the Life of his Bea&s;t</HI>; and this in Oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Cruelty</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. xii.10.</NOTE> which the <HI>tender Mercies of the Wicked</HI> or <HI>Savage Men</HI> are affirm'd to have; it mo&s;t naturally implies, that tho&s;e <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> are them&s;elves really &s;en&s;ible Crea|tures, and not incapable of feeling the Effects of the Care, or of the Cruelty of their Ma&s;ters towards them.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) We hence learn more certainly, that the Souls of Men are <HI>Immaterial</HI>. For if we have found that the lower Faculties and Operations of the Souls of Brutes, require us to allow them to be Immaterial, how much more mu&s;t we do &s;o as to Human Souls? For if we proceed higher to the Rational, the Intelligent, the Penetrating, the Free, the Active, the Sagacious Soul which is in Man; if we con&s;ider its va&s;t Capacities and Faculties; and that it can and &s;ometimes does, act contrary to all the material Impre&s;&s;ions or Temptations which the &s;en&s;itive Soul lays

before it; contrary to all worldly Views and Motives, all corporeal and terre&s;trial Intere&s;ts, and that it can and &s;ometimes does freely chu&s;e Poverty, Mi&s;ery, and Per&s;ecution in this World, out of regard to God and Religion, and the Happine&s;s of a Future State; This Rational Soul, I &s;ay, mu&s;t needs be of &s;o va&s;tly higher a Nature, of &s;uch va&s;tly nobler Faculties, of &s;uch a va&s;tly &s;uperior Rank in the Creation, that He who can once &s;uppo&s;e, that there is nothing in this Ca&s;e but &s;uch Matter as we have Knowledge of in the World, with its Accidents, is in a fair way to believe any Properties may belong to any Beings, and that there is really no Di&s;tinction between a Square and a Circle; no Difference be|tween Strength of Rea&s;on, and the Sound of an Organ; no Preference between the Arguments u&s;ed in a Theological Di&s;pute, and the Colli&s;i|on of Ela&s;tical Bodies in Motion; between a piece of Clock-work manag'd by Wheels and Springs, and an Human Soul govern'd by Rea|&s;on and Religion; which Confu&s;ion of Things, entirely different in their own Nature, &s;eems to me &s;o ab&s;urd and prepo&s;terous, &s;o wild and auk|ward, that I have not Patience to &s;et about a more opero&s;e Confutation of it. Tho&s;e who are under any Temptation to believe &s;uch Notions, which &s;eem to me no le&s;s fooli&s;h than the wilde&s;t Dreams of Ignorance and Super&s;tition them&s;elves, may con&s;ult <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See his Letter to My <HI>$d|well</HI> $d its four Le|&s;ences.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s excellent Confutation of a late Writer upon this Head.

a Confutation. But this is too like a Digre&s;&s;i|on to be farther in&s;i&s;ted on in this Place. How|ever, we may ob&s;erve here, how agreeable this Immateriality of Human Souls is to the Sacred Hi&s;tory of their fir&s;t Original; where after the <HI>Lord God had formed Man out of the du&s;t of the Ground</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. ii.7.</NOTE> the material Body, perhaps with its &s;en&s;itive Soul al&s;o; He di&s;tinctly, from above, infus'd the Rational: <HI>He breathed into his No|&s;trils the Breath of Life, and Man became a living Soul</HI>.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) We hence learn not only the <HI>Immateria|lity</HI>, but the <HI>Immortality</HI> al&s;o of Human Souls; or that the De&s;truction and Di&s;&s;olution of the Body, with its Sen&s;ations, will not de&s;troy or di&s;&s;olve the Rational Soul united thereto; but will leave it &s;till capable, not only of exi&s;ting, but of acting in another State; if it plea&s;e God &s;o to di&s;po&s;e of it, that it may have prope$ Opportunities for doing &s;o. So far, as I take it, true Philo&s;ophy carries us here; I mean, it obliges us to put &s;uch a difference between the rational Soul, and the brute Body, that the Ruin of the one will no way infer the Ruin of the other; and that therefore, &s;ince Divine Revelation a&s;&s;ures us of the living and acting of the Soul in the intermediate State, and al&s;o of its Return to the Body, and acting therein again after the Re|&s;urrection, this is all agreeable to &s;ound Rea&s;on and Philo&s;ophy, to good Sen&s;e and the Laws of Nature: Tho' &s;till all this, without a&s;&s;erting &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary Immortality, or Eternal Durati|on in Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery, as is independent on the Power, and Will, and Laws of the Au|thor of Nature; to which all the Enjoyments, and Faculties, and Perceptions of a Human Soul
<PB N="105" REF="146">
may &s;till be owing hereafter, altho' the Sub|&s;tance it &s;elf of that Soul &s;hould, of it &s;elf, when once created, continue to exi&s;t, as all real Beings &s;eem to do, without any particular In|terpo&s;ition of Providence for &s;uch their Conti|nuance. Philo&s;ophy, Mathematical and Expe|rimental Philo&s;ophy, obliges us to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Soul will continue to exi&s;t after Death, and will therefore be &s;till <HI>capable</HI> of Action and En|joyment, of Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery. Divine Re|velation a&s;&s;ures us this &s;eparate Soul <HI>&s;hall</HI> Act and Enjoy, &s;hall partake of Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery in a lower State and inferior Degree before, and in an higher State and &s;uperior Degree after the Re&s;urrection: So that Rea&s;on and Religion &s;up|ply, and &s;upport, and confirm each other, and, upon the whole, a&s;&s;ure us of the Truth of this grand Principle of all Religion, e&s;pecially of the Chri&s;tian, That this Life is not the only, or the principal Stage on which we are to Act; that this World is not the only or the principal Time for our Happine&s;s, or Mi&s;ery; but that, after this frail and mortal Life is ended, which is only a &s;hort State of Tryal and Probation, we mu&s;t live a longer one of Enjoyment hereafter. Which Truth is of that Importance for us to be &s;atisfy'd in, that nothing of either Natural or Supernatural Knowledge, which tends thereto, ought to be neglected by us. Nor may we here omit the exact Agreement of this Natural Truth of the <HI>Immortality</HI> of Human Souls with Divine Revelation, particularly with our Sa|viour's own important Words upon this Head: <HI>Fear not them which kill the Body,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. x.28.</NOTE> <HI>but are not able to kill the Soul: but rather fear him, who is able to de&s;troy both Soul and Body in Hell</HI>.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="106" REF="147">(4.) We hence learn the <HI>Being of God</HI>, the fir&s;t Intelligent Cau&s;e and Author, the ju&s;t Owner and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, the Supreme Lord and Governor, the con&s;tant Pre&s;erver and Di&s;po&s;er of all Things. This Foundation of all Religi|on, the Belief of a Supreme Deity, is the fir&s;t, the mo&s;t natural and obvious Deduction of Hu|man Rea&s;on, even from the Contemplation of the mo&s;t common and ordinary Appearances of Nature; from the Growth of every Plant, and the Succe&s;&s;ion of every Sea&s;on, and the gene|ral View of every Heavenly Body, and every Creature about us. And there have certainly been no Nations or People, of the u&s;ual Capa|cities of Mankind, but have ever drawn this Con&s;equence in all Ages of the World. So that if this Inference be not the <HI>Voice of Nature</HI> it &s;elf, we &s;hall be at a great lo&s;s to find other Truths, requiring any Rea&s;oning at all that can de&s;erve to be &s;o &s;tiled. And no wonder, &s;ince the Argument is the very &s;ame by which, from the Contemplation of a Building, we in|fer a Builder; and from the Elegancy and U&s;e|fulne&s;s of each Part, we gather he was a skil|ful Architect; or by which from the View of a Piece of Clockwork, we conclude the Being of the Clockmaker; and from the many regular Motions therein, we believe that he was a curi|ous Artificer. Which Deductions he who is not <HI>Able</HI> to make, has not the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI>; and he that will not allow them to be <HI>Ju&s;t</HI>, has not the <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> of the meane&s;t Countryman. 'Tis true, that if this &s;ort of arguing were confin'd to Childhood or Folly; to the Age of Igno|rance, or the Temper of Ideots; if the more nicely we viewed the World, the le&s;s Rea&s;on we
<PB N="107" REF="148">
found to admire its Contrivance; and when we were come to the top of Enquiry and Examina|tion, we lo&s;t all the Occa&s;ions of our Wonder and Adoration: If, I &s;ay, this were the Ca&s;e, a &s;ober Per&s;on might think fit to &s;u&s;pend his A&s;|&s;ent, and to ca&s;t about for &s;ome other Solution of the Phaenomena of Nature. But in ca&s;e the wi&s;e and examining Man &s;till finds va&s;tly &s;tronger and more numerous Rea&s;ons for the Acknowledgment of the Divine Exi&s;tence, than the Fool, or the carele&s;s Enquirer does; &s;o that if he &s;pends his whole Life in the pur&s;uit of this &s;ort of Knowledge, he perceives new Argu|ments every where crowd upon him to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; which is the known Ca&s;e, as to Expe|rimental Philo&s;ophy, at this Day; He who is &s;till re&s;olv'd to &s;u&s;pend his A&s;&s;ent, and either to wrap him&s;elf up in wilful Sceptici&s;m, as if he knew nothing; or to try how far he can be ab|&s;urd enough to believe, that the World is it &s;elf the only God, the only Eternal, Omnipotent, All-wi&s;e Being; or, which is yet more ab&s;urd, that all the Wonders in its Contrivance came meerly by Chance and Accident; and will continue by Chance and Accident, till by the like Chance and Accident they all come to nothing again: He, I &s;ay, who acts thus, does certainly, if ever Man did, <HI>dare operam ut cum ratione in&s;aniat; takes great pains to &s;hew him&s;elf, with great Learning, the mo&s;t egregious Fool in the World</HI>.

Men are without Excu&s;e</HI> for Athei&s;m.

Accordingly from what has been before advanc'd, we learn,</P>
<P N="5">(5.) That the World has not been from all Eternity, but that God was the <HI>Creator</HI> of it, and that He, and He alone, at fir&s;t Di&s;po&s;ed and Ordered the &s;everal Parts of the Uni|ver&s;e, into that wi&s;e and wonderful Structure in which we now &s;ee them. I do not here mean to intermeddle with that more intricate Problem of the proper <HI>Creation</HI> of the <HI>Matter of the Uni|ver&s;e out of Nothing</HI>; becau&s;e the Phaenomena of Nature give us no Indications either way: nor, as I under&s;tand it, does Divine Revelati|on ever directly concern it &s;elf with it. Only, that I may not be mi&s;taken, I declare my own Opinion to be &s;till, as it has ever been, again&s;t the Eternity of Matter, and for its Original Creation out of nothing by the Almighty Pow|er of God. But then, I am not only of <HI>Opi|nion</HI>, but am fully <HI>Satisfy'd</HI> from the plain Phaenomena of Nature, that the World was, in the more ordinary Sen&s;e, originally Created, and at fir&s;t put into that State in which, for the main, we &s;till find it, by the Divine Power, Wi&s;|dom and Goodne&s;s. I have already &s;hewed, that the pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem of things, acting accord|ing to tho&s;e Laws of Motion and Nature which are now fixed in the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pag.</HI> 88, 89, 90, prius.</NOTE> cannot po&s;&s;ibly have been <HI>a parte ante</HI>, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly be <HI>a parte po&s;t</HI> Eternal: Much le&s;s is it po&s;&s;ible, that

one little Corner of it, &s;uch as our Earth, &s;hould have been, or &s;hould be hereafter Eternal by it &s;elf. This pretended Eternity of the World, is indeed &s;o far from the Re&s;ult of any ju&s;t Rea|&s;oning, or Philo&s;ophical Evidence, (and to any Divine Revelation it never yet, that I know of, made the lea&s;t Claim;) that I dare appeal to the entire Sy&s;tem of Nature, whether there ap|pear one &s;ingle Argument for, or Indication of &s;uch an Eternity, either <HI>a parte ante</HI>, or <HI>a parte po&s;t</HI>, in the whole Univer&s;e. I profe&s;s, I know none. And unle&s;s Men be &s;o weak as to leave Fact, Nature, Experiments, and Mathematicks, for the Subtilties of Metaphy&s;icks, and the Cob|webs of Ab&s;tract Notions, they mu&s;t believe the World not to have been, or to be Eter|nal. But for tho&s;e that are &s;ubtil enough to deny the Reality of Motion, or the Freedom of Human Actions, becau&s;e they are not able to account Metaphy&s;ically for Motions Migration from one Subject to another, as they &s;peak, or for the Mode and Seat of Human Freedom in the Soul; while their own Sen&s;es and Ob&s;erva|tions do every Day of their Lives a&s;&s;ure them of the Reality of them both; they are Per&s;ons fit for the Athei&s;ts Purpo&s;e in this Matter, and will be proper Patrons for the Eternity of the World. He that, with <HI>Ocellus Lucanus</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Univer|&s;o</HI>, Cap. 1.</NOTE> can prove the World to have <HI>no End</HI> in Point of Du|ration, becau&s;e it is of a round Figure, which certainly in another Sen&s;e has <HI>no End</HI>; or He that can demon&s;trate from ab&s;tract Rea&s;oning about the Nature of Matter, and that Equality of Mo|tion he may &s;uppo&s;e to be in every Part of the Univer&s;e; that a certain Clock or Watch will of it &s;elf go for ever, tho' at the &s;ame time he &s;ees

From the foregoing <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> we learn, that God, the Creator of the World, does al&s;o ex|erci&s;e a continual <HI>Providence</HI> over it, and does interpo&s;e his general, immechanical, immediate <HI>Power</HI>, which we call the <HI>Power of Gravity</HI>, as al&s;o his particular immechanical <HI>Powers of Re|fraction, of Attraction</HI>, and <HI>Repul&s;e, &amp;c.</HI> in the &s;everal particular Ca&s;es of the Phaenomena of the World; and without which all this beauti|ful <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> would fall to Pieces, and di&s;&s;olve into Atoms. On which Occa&s;ion, the <HI>Apo&s;tolical

V.7. <HI>init.</HI></NOTE> when they &s;ay, <HI>The whole World is held together by the Hand of God</HI>. For, as we have already ob&s;erv'd, though we &s;hould not think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e a particular In|terpo&s;ition of the Supreme Being, in the Con|&s;ervation of the Natures or Exi&s;tence of Things, and of their Original Projectile Motions, which once begun may continue of them&s;elves, with|out any new or particular Support; (in which Ca&s;e however not a few think it nece&s;&s;ary to introduce the &s;ame, and that the <HI>Con&s;ervation</HI> of Things is no other than a kind of <HI>continual Creation</HI> of them;) tho', I &s;ay, we &s;hould not think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e, that continual in|terpo&s;ing Providence in the material World, in order to its Pre&s;ervation, yet can we not avoid allowing it in that grand immechanical Power of the Univer&s;e, I mean that of Gravity, and in the other immechanical Powers of the &s;ame Nature above-mentioned. The&s;e do continually act in the World, and alter the Places and Mo|tions of Bodies perpetually; which makes me commonly chu&s;e to call them here <HI>Powers</HI> ra|ther than <HI>Laws</HI>, as the <HI>Power</HI> of Gravity, or Refraction, rather than the <HI>Law</HI> of Gravi|ty or Refraction; and &s;o for the re&s;t. For this I take to be the Difference between a <HI>Power</HI> and a <HI>Law</HI>, &s;peaking &s;trictly; that a <HI>Law</HI> be|longs to &s;uch Rules as nece&s;&s;arily flow from &s;ome Property of Bodies, without any new Action exercis'd thereupon; as that <HI>Bodies once in Motion continue for ever to move with that Degree of Velocity which they once have, without Intermi&s;&s;ion, along tho&s;e &s;trait Lines, according to which tho&s;e Motions are already directed:</HI> But a
<PB N="113" REF="154">
<HI>Power</HI> is here <HI>Such a Rule, by which the Bodies are con&s;tantly moved out of tho&s;e Lines, and from tho&s;e Velocities they naturally had, into other Lines and Velocities di&s;tinct from them</HI>; which plainly implies a real Action, a true Force, Impre&s;&s;ion or Influence actually exerted upon them; whether we call it Impul&s;e, or Attraction, it matters not; and this perpetually al&s;o: Which is therefore quite different from the foregoing Ca&s;e, as to the ordinary Mechanical Laws of Motion; and &s;uppo&s;es a real Agent, and He &s;ufficiently Active, and Powerful al&s;o to remove all &s;uch Bodies through the Univer&s;e perpetually. For I de&s;ire tho&s;e who think otherwi&s;e, to tell me, how unactive Mat|ter, without &s;uch a continual Exerci&s;e of Force upon it, can be continually oblig'd to leave its natural, even, rectilinear Motion, and to move fa&s;ter, or &s;lower, in a curve Line? Can it, of it &s;elf, admit of a <HI>Law of Gravity</HI>, and of it &s;elf ever exert this <HI>Clinamen</HI>, this <HI>Departure</HI> from its proper Cour&s;e? But this is to &s;uppo&s;e it not <HI>unactive Matter</HI>, but an <HI>intelligent Self-moving Being</HI>, which alone is capable of under|&s;tanding of Laws, and acting according to them. In &s;hort, it &s;eems to me mo&s;t evident from the Phaenomena of the World, that all &s;uch Laws or Powers as we are now &s;peaking of, which are many and wonderful, and yet ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Pre&s;ervation of the pre|&s;ent Sy&s;tem, are the real Effects of the conti|nual <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> of God him&s;elf, for the Con&s;ervation of the <HI>Univer&s;e</HI>; and that whenever he plea&s;es to &s;u&s;pend &s;uch Exerci&s;e of that Power and Providence, the World it &s;elf will di&s;&s;olve into Atoms, and its pre&s;ent Form

whether there be one &s;ingle Indication of &s;uch a rigid Fatality, and Nece&s;&s;ity therein.

<P N="9">9. We learn from the true Sy&s;tem of the World, that this Supreme God is an <HI>Intelligent</HI> and <HI>Omni&s;cient</HI> Being, and that he knows the entire State and Condition of every Body con|tain'd in this entire Univer&s;e, at what Di|&s;tances, and in what Circum&s;tances &s;oever; and that in every Moment of Time from the Begin|ning of this Sy&s;tem, till its Conclu&s;ion. This is derived from Ob&s;ervations 21&s;t and 22d foregoing; and is a mo&s;t unque&s;tionable De|duction from the Phaenomena of the Univer&s;e.

For in this Sen&s;e only, can the Phaeno|mena of Created Beings, which mu&s;t be every way finite, become Demon&s;trations of the At|tributes of their Uncreated Original Creator; which alone can be, &s;trictly &s;peaking, e&s;teemed

ab&s;olutely Infinite. Nor are we here, or in other Ca&s;es, concerned any farther. For if the Supreme Author of our Univer&s;e, does certainly and exactly know what&s;oever is, or is done in this Univer&s;e, what does it concern us, whether he equally knows what&s;oever is, or is done in any other Invi&s;ible or Imaginary Sy&s;tems beyond it? Although he who believes that this Omni|&s;cience, or other &s;uch infinite Attributes, belong truly to the Supreme God, its Author, to the utmo&s;t Extent of this grand Sy&s;tem, mu&s;t be a very &s;trange Per&s;on, if he can deny, or doubt whether the Omni&s;cience of the &s;ame Supreme Being, extends to the re&s;t of the other invi&s;ible Sy&s;tems al&s;o; &s;uppo&s;ing there be &s;uch other Sy&s;tems, and that they are the Workman&s;hip of his Hands al&s;o, as well as ours.

<P N="10">(10.) We learn further from the true Sy&s;tem of the World, that this Supreme God does not barely know and under&s;tand all the Bodies, and all that is done by all the Bodies, in this entire grand Sy&s;tem, but he mo&s;t <HI>Wi&s;ely</HI> and <HI>Pru|dently</HI>, and <HI>Sagaciou&s;ly Orders and Di&s;po&s;es of all the &s;aid Bodies</HI>, and particular Sy&s;tems there|to belonging.

Truth and Certainty of it. Nor could there be any Occa&s;ion for enlarging on this Head, were it not that the Moral or Living World, does not here always &s;eem to agree with the Natural or A&s;tronomical one. In the latter there is plainly and every where Marks of &s;uch Exactne&s;s, Harmony, Prudence, Sagacity, Wi&s;dom, and Conduct, that not only perfectly Convinces, but Amazes and A&s;toni&s;hes us, even all of us, who throughly con&s;ider the particu|lar In&s;tances, the innumerable, clear, irrefraga|ble In&s;tances of the &s;ame, in every Part of the Univer&s;e: And he mu&s;t be &s;tupid to the utmo&s;t Degree, who can go a Cour&s;e of Mechanicks, of Anatomy, of Botanicks, and e&s;pecially of A&s;tronomy, without the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory Con|viction in this Ca&s;e. Tho&s;e natural Sciences, particularly A&s;tronomy, will fully demon&s;trate what the Sacred Writings have already inform'd us of;<NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;alm cxlvii.4, 5.</NOTE> not only that <HI>God telleth the Number of the Stars, and calleth them all by their Names</HI>; that <HI>great is our Lord, and of great Power</HI>, and that <HI>of his Under&s;tanding there is no Number</HI>; but al&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">civ.24.</NOTE> that <HI>His Works are manifold, and $word$ Wi&s;dom has he made them all</HI>. But then, how it comes about that we do by no means per|ceive the &s;ame Exactne&s;s and Harmony, in the Moral and Living World; which we every|where &s;ee in the Material and Phy&s;ical, is a great and noble Problem; though not belonging to this Place. I have my &s;elf occa&s;ionally touch'd upon it in my other Writings; but ac|knowledge it to de&s;erve a much larger and fuller Di&s;qui&s;ition.

<P N="11">(11.) We learn farther from the true Sy&s;tem of the World, that the Supreme God, who Made and Governs it, is a mo&s;t <HI>Powerful</HI> and <HI>Almighty Being</HI>; whom nothing can re&s;i&s;t, and again&s;t whom nothing can oppo&s;e it &s;elf in the whole Creation. This is not only the natu$$l Re&s;ult of this World's derivation from God, and its receiving all its Powers and Abilities from him; which mu&s;t needs imply, that $e Author of them all is &s;till of greater Power; and that no created Might can oppo&s;e it &s;elf again&s;t that Might by which it was it &s;elf crea|ted; but is a direct Con&s;equence from the $3d Ob&s;ervation before-going. And that we may have &s;ome particular Notion of the Greatne&s;s of
<PB N="120" REF="161">
the Divine Power, and Almighty Efficacy in this our own Sy&s;tem, let us con&s;ider the Great|ne&s;s of the Bodies it every where moves; and the Velocity with which it moves them. The former you may find in the Table, <HI>pag.</HI> 56. and the latter in that <HI>pag.</HI> 53. whereby it appears, that the Planets alone, which are continually moved, are together above Four Hundred Mil|lions of Millions of Cubical Miles in Magni|tude; that the Velocity wherewith they are mov'd, in their Annual Motion, is, at a mean, about 52000 Miles in an Hour; and that the Velocity of the Corpu&s;cles of Light is &s;till va&s;t|ly greater, and no le&s;s than Six Hundred and Fifty Millions of Miles in the &s;ame time; and all this has been &s;o continually from the begin|ning of the whole Sy&s;tem to this very Day; and that without the lea&s;t proper Re&s;i&s;tance or Oppo&s;ition from either any of the&s;e Bodies them|&s;elves, or from any other Power or Agent what|&s;oever. On which account we may every one of us well &s;ay with Holy <HI>Job</HI>, after God had made an Eminent Repre&s;entation to him of his own Omnipotence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job xliii.2, 6.</NOTE> and of <HI>Job</HI>'s Weakne&s;s; <HI>I know that thou can&s;t do every thing, and that no Thought of thine can be hindred:&mdash; Wherefore I abhor my &s;elf, and repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes.</HI></P>
<P N="12">(12.) We learn farther from this true Sy&s;tem, That the Supreme God, who made and governs the World, is every where &s;ub&s;tantially and real|ly <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> through the whole; or is at all Times, and in all Places, <HI>Omnipre&s;ent</HI>. This is a mo&s;t direct Con&s;equence of the Divine Knowledge, and Wi&s;dom, and Power, the At|tributes and Actions of the Supreme Being, con|tinually exerted throughout the whole Univer&s;e.
<PB N="121" REF="162" MS="Y">
Nor can we any more conceive them actually exercis'd <HI>where</HI>, than <HI>when</HI> that Being, who&s;e Attributes and Powers they are, does not it &s;elf exi&s;t; which la&s;t is by all Men allow'd to be gro&s;ly ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible. Nor does either the Sun, or any other Being, afford us any thing, like a Virtual, as di&s;tinct from a Sub|&s;tantial Pre&s;ence and Efficacy. The Sun indeed &s;ends out Rays of Light, which Rays operate where the Sun is not: But then both of them operate only where them&s;elves are. Nor is any other Notion con&s;i&s;tent with common Sen&s;e, or the po&s;&s;ibilities of Things. For to &s;ay that a Being Acts <HI>where</HI> it is not, is to &s;ay in effect, that <HI>Nothing</HI> Acts in that place; or that the <HI>Effect</HI> produc'd, has in that Place <HI>no Cau&s;e</HI> to produce it; which are the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Ab&s;urdities and Contradictions po&s;&s;ibles. But then, as to the Va&s;tne&s;s of the Extent of this Pre&s;ence of God, through this grand Sy&s;tem, including all the Sy&s;tems of the Fixed Stars al&s;o, it is to us hi|therto unlimited and undetermin'd; tho', in all probability, in it &s;elf not really Infinite.

And no wonder, &s;ince 'tis highly probable that both of them, as to their inmo&s;t Nature, and large&s;t Extent, are alone knowable by that High and Lofty One, who, in the Prophet's Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Inhabits Eternity</HI>.</P>

This Property is highly remarkable, and of great Con&s;equence again&s;t tho&s;e who are unwilling to allow any real Being but Matter in the Univer&s;e. Whereas it has for|merly

So little do the Wi&s;hes, and De&s;ires, and Fancies, and Hypothe&s;es of the Old and New Athei&s;ts, agree with the true Sy|&s;tem of the Univer&s;e!

I heartily wi&s;h, that &s;uch Per&s;ons would well con&s;ider of this Ob&s;ervation; and no long|er make u&s;e of tho&s;e &s;mall Arguments, to take away the Being and Attributes of God; which &s;till appear, when we come to real Fact, Expe|riment, and Demon&s;tration, to be as little agree|able to Philo&s;ophy and Mathematicks, as they are in them&s;elves Impious, and Bla&s;phemous again&s;t their great Creator and Benefactor. Nature as well as Scripture teaching us, that <HI>God is a Spirit</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">John iv.23, 24.</NOTE> and that by Con&s;equence, <HI>they that wor&s;hip Him mu&s;t wor&s;hip Him in Spirit and in Truth</HI>.</P>
<P N="14">(14.) We learn moreover from this true Sy|&s;tem of the World, that the Supreme God, the Maker and Governor of the Univer&s;e, is a <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Beneficent</HI> Being, and one that takes Care of the Welfare and Happine&s;s of his Crea|tures. This is a direct Con&s;equence from no &s;mall Number of the Ob&s;ervations foregoing,

which &s;hew the great Care he has taken of the Situation and Motion, and Circum&s;tances of the &s;everal Planets, at due Di&s;tances from the Sun, and from one another, that &s;o they might be the mo&s;t commodious and comfortable Habita|tions for the Creatures that were to live upon them.

Upon the whole, the Provi&s;ion that is made by the Divine Providence for Men, and all Creatures living, which alone are capable of the Goodne&s;s and Beneficence of the Creator, both in their Entry into, and during their entire Con|tinuance in this World, is &s;o ample, &s;o abun|dant, &s;o &s;urprizing, that he who carefully con|&s;iders the Particulars in all Sorts and Species of Animals with us, and e&s;pecially in Man, the Lord of them all, will be &s;oon obliged not only to grant, that God is a Beneficent Being, but al&s;o, with the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI>, to Admire, and Adore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. 107.</NOTE> and <HI>Prai&s;e the Lord for his Goodne&s;s, and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men</HI>. And this Inference is the more ju&s;t, becau&s;e the Infinite Perfection, and Self-&s;ufficiency of the Divine Nature, does &s;o entirely privilege him from all Want, and from all expectation of In|crea&s;e of Happine&s;s from any of his Creatures, that every one of the In&s;tances of his Benefi|cence, both in the Creation and Con&s;ervation, and Provi&s;ion for tho&s;e Creatures, mu&s;t needs
<PB N="126" REF="167">
be the alone free and generous Effects of his Bounty, and the gratuitous Communication of his Goodne&s;s to them; in order not to <HI>his</HI>, but to <HI>their own</HI> Happine&s;s and Felicity; which Circum&s;tance renders this Goodne&s;s and Benefi|cence the mo&s;t highly Meritorious and Divine of all others what&s;oever. I do not here take no|tice of the Objections again&s;t this Goodne&s;s and Beneficence of the Divine Nature, from the &s;eeming Irregularities now appearing in the Mo|tal and Rational Part of the Creation; becau&s;e Divine Revelation always owns &s;uch &s;eeming Irregularities at pre&s;ent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. ii.5.</NOTE> and refers the full So|lution of them to the <HI>Day of the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God</HI> hereafter; be|cau&s;e we are hitherto not &s;ufficiently acquainted with the la&s;t Re&s;ult and Up&s;hot of Things to determine tho&s;e Matters; and becau&s;e the mo&s;t ancient <HI>Recognitions</HI> of <HI>Clement</HI> have prevented me in good Part, and afforded more Authentick and valuable Hints, than any others which we at this Day can propo&s;e, towards their Solution. To which therefore I &s;hall here, as I did before, re|fer the Inqui&s;itive Reader for better Satisfaction. Only &s;o far the pre&s;ent Propo&s;ition, as well as a foregoing One, may be of u&s;e to us in that Matter; as it a&s;&s;ures us of the Goodne&s;s and Beneficence of God, in the wonderful Contri|vance of the World about us, for the Ea&s;e and Comfort of the &s;everal Creatures which are therein: Which cannot but di&s;po&s;e us to be|lieve, that the &s;ame Attributes will at la&s;t ap|pear equally glorious as to the <HI>Moral</HI>, as they do already as to the <HI>Natural</HI> World.</P>
<P N="15">(15.) We learn farther from the true Sy&s;tem of the World, that the Supreme God is invariably
<PB N="127" REF="168">
the &s;ame in all Ages; or that he is an <HI>Immutable</HI> Being. I do not mean that he is &s;o rigidly <HI>Immutable</HI> as to be <HI>Inexorable</HI> to the Prayers of his Suppliants, who ask in a due manner what is fit for them; or that he has <HI>immutably decreed</HI> the <HI>Fates</HI> of Men, let them do whatever they will. The&s;e Properties would not be tho&s;e of a Wi&s;e or Good Being, but of a Fooli&s;h and Evil one. Nor do the Phaenomena, whence I draw this Attribute of Immutability, in the lea&s;t im|ply any &s;uch Things. But I mean, that God ap|pears to act by certain and con&s;tant Laws of Mo|tion, of Gravity, of Refraction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and this at all Times, and in all Places of the Univer&s;e, from the beginning of this Sy&s;tem or World till this very Day; and from the utmo&s;t Limits of the &s;ame Sy&s;tem one way, to tho&s;e that are op|po&s;ite, &s;o far as we are ever able to examine; without any Variation from the &s;ame, from one Generation to another. Tho&s;e only Ca&s;es are to be excepted, wherein God is plea&s;ed to in|terpo&s;e in a more immediate manner, and by leaving or contradicting the &s;ettled Cour&s;e of Nature and ordinary Providence, does more effectually demon&s;trate his Divine Power and particular Providence in &s;ome extraordinary and miraculous Ca&s;es, for the greater Benefit of any of his Creatures. Tho' by the way it will de|&s;erve to be con&s;idered, whether even in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, &s;uch miraculous Operations may not be, u&s;ually at lea&s;t, brought about, rather by the means of Angels, or of &s;ome other Spiritual and Invi&s;ible Beings, which Revelation and Hi|&s;tory a&s;&s;ures us are as his Mini&s;ters in the World, without the direct Alteration of tho&s;e Fixed and Con&s;tant Laws of Nature, which we other|wi&s;e
<PB N="128" REF="169">
find to be immutably ob&s;erv'd by him. Thus that <HI>Iron</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 King vi.5, 6.</NOTE> which was made to <HI>&s;wim</HI> in Water by the Prophet, contrary to the known Law of Specifick Gravity, might as well be &s;up|ported by an invi&s;ible Agent, notwith&s;tanding its &s;uperior Gravity, as that &s;uperior Gravity, by the direct Sub&s;traction of the Divine Influ|ence by taken away from it; and &s;o in many other Ca&s;es; and this without the Impeachment of the Miracles them&s;elves, or their Intentions among Mankind. However, &s;ince we have already proved that the Supreme Being is a Powerful, a Wi&s;e, a Good, and a Free Agent, as well as we are now &s;hewing him to be an Immutable One, it cannot be ju&s;t &s;o to interpret one of the&s;e Di|vine Perfections, as at all to cla&s;h with, or con|tradict the other: and by Con&s;equence, we are not &s;o to e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>Immutability</HI>, as in any Ca&s;e to hinder the <HI>free Exerci&s;e</HI> of his Power, Wi&s;|dom, and Goodne&s;s, where &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons de|termine Him to act as he plea&s;es in the Govern|ment of the World. For that would be a &s;trange Notion of a Powerful, Wi&s;e, Good, and Free Being, that He could exerci&s;e that Power, Wi&s;dom, and Goodne&s;s, in only one invariable manner, let the Occa&s;ions for a different Exer|ci&s;e of the &s;ame be never &s;o great or nece&s;&s;ary. But, this Ca&s;e excepted, Nature and Scripture agree, that <HI>in God is no variablene&s;s, neither &s;hadow of turning</HI>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. i.17.</NOTE></P>
<P N="16">(16.) We learn al&s;o from this true Sy&s;tem of the World, that the Supreme God, the Maker and Governor of all Things, is not a blind Fate, or Series of nece&s;&s;ary Cau&s;es and Effects, but is a <HI>Spiritual</HI>, a <HI>Living</HI>, and an <HI>Active</HI> Being; per|petually exerting his Divine Perfections in the
<PB N="129" REF="170">
whole Univer&s;e. I do not here take the Word <HI>Spiritual</HI> meerly for Incorporeal or Immaterial; which Property I have already di&s;cour&s;ed upon; but as importing al&s;o that Vigor, and tho&s;e Acti|ons which brute Matter is uncapable of, and which are the proper Effects of Life, and on which Account the Sacred Writings &s;o often call GOD the <HI>Living God</HI>, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e Dead or Inanimate Heathen Idols, which were not able to do any Thing either for Mercy or Judgment. Now that the Supreme God, the Author of all Things, mu&s;t be thus a <HI>Spiritual Living</HI> and <HI>Active</HI> Being, continually Ob&s;erving, $nd Knowing, and Ordering, and Providing, and Acting in the World, is not only highly proba|$le becau&s;e he is the Creatot of all; and there|$ore will not certainly forget, or overlook, or $eglect the <HI>Works of his own Hands</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. cxxxviii.8.</NOTE> but is di|$ectly proved from many of the foregoing Pro|$o&s;itions, which have given us abundant In&s;tan|$es of &s;uch his Life and Activity. And no won|$er that the Supreme Spiritual Being is thus Living and Active, &s;ince, as Material Sub&s;tance $r Body is in its own Nature, according to all $he Experience we ever have of it, Dead, Inert, $nd wholly Unactive; &s;o does it &s;eem that $piritual Sub&s;tance, or Soul, is in its own Na|$re in general, Living, Active, and Vigorous; $nd that the different Degrees of &s;uch Life, $ctivity, and Vigor, do con&s;titute or proceed $om the &s;everal Kinds of Spiritual Beings, from $e meane&s;t &s;en&s;itive Soul of a Brute, up to the $upreme Spirit of the Univer&s;e him&s;elf. I do $t mean with <HI>De Cartes</HI>, that a Soul or Spiri|$al Being does for ever actually think, or is al|$ays by nece&s;&s;ity of Nature, in Action; no
<PB N="130" REF="171">
more than I believe that a Body is ever really, and by nece&s;&s;ity of Nature in Motion; but that it is always Quick and Active and Ready, up|on all Occa&s;ions and Objects that pre&s;ent them|&s;elves, to think, and con&s;ider, and re&s;olve, and exert it &s;elf; and that this Faculty is one of its main Di&s;tinctions from Body or Matter, which is entirely de&s;titute of all &s;uch Faculties what&s;oever. And certainly, He that produc'd all the Living, and Active Powers and Abilities which are in the Creatures, mu&s;t him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;s them in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t exalted manner po&s;&s;ible; which Life and Activity, if He, the Supreme Being, were wholly bereaved of, he would be &s;o far from the Object of our Wor|&s;hip, Fear, Love, and Adoration, as all Men naturally look upon him to be, that he would be certainly the Subject only of Neglect and Contempt. Wherefore Philo&s;ophy, as well as Religion, a&s;&s;ure us of the Truth of what <HI>Darius</HI> an Heathen King was once obliged to acknow|ledge, that <HI>Men ought to tremble and fear before God;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. vi.26, 27.</NOTE> <HI>for He is the Living God, and &s;tedfa&s;t for ever; and his Kingdom that which &s;hall not be de&s;troyed. And He worketh Signs and Wonders in Heaven and in Earth.</HI></P>
<P N="17">(17.) We farther learn from the true Sy&s;tem of the Univer&s;e, That the Supreme God, the Maker and Governor of all Things, is but <HI>One</HI>. This <HI>Unity</HI> of God, or that there is but <HI>One</HI>. Infinite, Eternal, Omnipotent Being or Agent, who created and governs all Things, is among the fir&s;t Dictates of Nature and right Rea&s;on, when it reflects upon the obvious Phaenomena of the World, and is mo&s;t clearly confirm'd by all the foregoing Ob&s;ervations. The <HI>Univer&s;e</HI>
<PB N="131" REF="172">
appears thereby to be evidently <HI>One Univer&s;e</HI>; govern'd by <HI>One Law of Gravity</HI> through the whole; and ob&s;erving the <HI>&s;ame Laws</HI> of Mo|tion every where.

So that this <HI>Unity of God</HI>, is now for ever e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by that more certain Knowledge we have of the Univer&s;e; as it was naturally al&s;o, tho' in a le&s;&s;er Degree, di&s;coverable by all Man|kind before.

<P N="18">(18.) La&s;tly, we learn from this true Sy&s;tem of the World, that we and all Creatures are en|tirely under the <HI>Dominion</HI>, and &s;ubject to the &s;upreme <HI>Authority</HI> of this One God, as to <HI>our Lord and Governor</HI>. This is the mo&s;t natural and obvious Con&s;equence, from what has been hi|therto proved, concerning the Exi&s;tence, the At|tributes, and the Providence of the One Su|preme God; that this World, wherein we all $ive, is <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>World</HI>; that this Sy&s;tem of the

This ab&s;olute <HI>Supremacy</HI> of the One God, and Obli|gation of all Derived and Created Beings to en|tire <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> to him, is &s;o plain from the&s;e Con&s;i|derations, that as He mu&s;t be the mo&s;t <HI>egregious Fool</HI>, in point of Prudence, that will dare to op|po&s;e him&s;elf to the Omnipotence of his Al|mighty Lord and King; &s;o is he the mo&s;t <HI>pro|fligate Wretch</HI> in point of Duty, that will ven|ture to refu&s;e his Submi&s;&s;ion to the Infinite Wi&s;|dom and Goodne&s;s of his mo&s;t beneficent Cre|ator, Father and Benefactor, <HI>In whom he lives, moves, and has his Being; and who&s;e Offspring he is</HI>.

<P>_SINCE it has now plea&s;ed God, as we have &s;een, to di&s;cover many no|ble and important Truths to us, by the Light of Nature, and the Sy|&s;tem of the World; as al&s;o, he has long di&s;covered many more noble and impor|tant Truths by Revelation, in the Sacred Books; It cannot be now improper, to compare the&s;e two <HI>Divine Volumes</HI>, as I may well call them, together; in &s;uch Ca&s;es, I mean, of Revelation, as relate to the Natural World, and wherein we may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted the better to judge, by the Knowledge of the Sy&s;tem of the Univer&s;e about us. For if tho&s;e Things contained in Scripture be true, and really deriv'd from the Author of Nature, we &s;hall find them, in proper Ca&s;es, confirm'd by the Sy&s;tem of the World; and the Frame of Nature will, in &s;ome Degree, $ear Witne&s;s to the Revelation. But if tho&s;e
<PB N="134" REF="175">
Points contain'd in Scripture be fal&s;e, and did not really come from God, we &s;hall find the Frame of Nature, which is now much better under&s;tood than in the Days of tho&s;e Antient Writers, frequently to contradict them, and &s;o to detect their Forgery, and prevent their fur|ther Impo&s;ition upon Mankind. Nor indeed have we any way &s;o &s;ure and &s;atisfactory to examine the pretended very ancient Accounts of Things by, as this in general; I mean, the trying their Verity in &s;uch Points, whether Natural or Hi|&s;torical, as we have &s;ure Methods of knowing, whether the Things a&s;&s;erted in them were, or might be really true or not. For as a plain Di&s;|agreement of Nature, or certain Hi&s;tory, from Scripture, in &s;uch Points, will afford a terrible Su&s;picion, that the latter is either fal&s;e, or at lea&s;t interpolated; &s;o will as plain an Agree|ment be a mighty Evidence for the Truth, and Uncorruptne&s;s of tho&s;e Scriptures; and this even in general, as to &s;uch other Contents of the &s;ame, as can no way come under the like Methods of Examination. If I am once fully &s;atisfy'd, that a Witne&s;s is Upright and Hone&s;t, ev$n in &s;everal Points where there was the greate&s;t Su&s;picion as to his Sincerity, he will de|&s;erve the better Credit in other Ca&s;es, even where no corroborating Evidence can be alledg'd for his Ju&s;tification. To this kind of Evidence then do I Appeal on behalf of tho&s;e Sacred Writings; and do plead for their Reception, as Genuine and Authentick Records, in the &s;everal particular Ca&s;es following.</P>

to God, from the Con&s;ideration of the true Sy&s;tem of the World. This I have taken care to prove or illu&s;trate all the way as I went over tho&s;e particular Truths and Attributes; and took notice that both Nature and Scripture all along corre&s;pond to the &s;everal Conclu&s;ions: That they jointly agree that the Souls of Brute Creatures are di&s;tinct from their gro&s;s Bodies, and are &s;en&s;itive, and mo&s;t probably <HI>incorporeal</HI>; That the Rational Souls of Men are more cer|tainly and entirely <HI>Immaterial</HI>; that they are al&s;o <HI>Immortal</HI>, or will naturally exi&s;t after the gro&s;s Bodies are di&s;&s;olved; that there is a God or <HI>Supreme Being</HI>; that this World has not been <HI>Eternal</HI>, but was <HI>Created</HI> by that Supreme Being; that this Supreme Being, the Creator of all Things, is an <HI>Eternal</HI> Being; that He Exerci&s;es a continual <HI>Providence</HI> over the Creatures he has made; that he is not a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary</HI>, but a <HI>Free Agent</HI>; that He is <HI>Intelligent</HI> and <HI>Omni&s;cient</HI>; that He is an <HI>All-wi&s;e</HI>, and that He is an <HI>All-powerful</HI> Being; that He is <HI>Omnipre&s;ent, Imma|terial</HI>, and <HI>Immutable</HI>; that He is <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Bene|ficent</HI>; that He is a <HI>Spiritual</HI>, and <HI>Living</HI>, and <HI>Active</HI> Being; that He is but <HI>One</HI>; and that He is therefore the alone Supreme <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Governor</HI> of the whole Univer&s;e. Now this cannot but be a great Confirmation of the Sacred Records, that &s;uch Deductions from A&s;tronomy and Na|tural Philo&s;ophy, as their Authors could either not at all, or very imperfectly make when they lived, do yet, upon that va&s;t Improvement of Natural Knowledge, which has been of late made, all appear right and agreeable to the true Sy&s;tem of Things. And this is more par|ticularly to be ob&s;erved, as to &s;uch of the be|fore-mentioned
<PB N="138" REF="179">
Divine Attributes, as the Hea|thens differ'd from the <HI>Jews</HI> and Chri&s;tians in; wherein the Sy&s;tem of the Univer&s;e does, as we have &s;een, every where bear Witne&s;s again&s;t the Heathen, and for the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and Chri&s;tian Notions in tho&s;e important Matters. I in&s;tance di|&s;tinctly in that grand Doctrine of the <HI>Unity</HI> of God, wherein the&s;e Sacred Records did all along differ from the current Notions, and con&s;equent Practices of the re&s;t of the World, in all tho&s;e Ages whereto they belong; and indeed in&s;i&s;ted on it to that degree, as to lay their entire Foun|dations on that <HI>Unity of God</HI>, in the directe&s;t oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Polythei&s;m</HI> of the re&s;t of the World; and this without the Pretence of grea|ter Natural Knowledge than was in other Nati|ons, to derive that Notion from; and yet with &s;uch Boldne&s;s and A&s;&s;urance, as to Ordain the hazard of Life it &s;elf, and of all the Comforts thereof upon its Truth, and the Hopes derived from it. This Agreement of the Sy&s;tem of the World to the <HI>Unity of God</HI>, now &s;o certainly di&s;covered by the Sy&s;tem of the <HI>Univer&s;e</HI>, in exact Concord with the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and Chri&s;tian Re|cords; and in direct Contradicton to the Opi|nions of the generality of the Heathen World, even in the Polite&s;t and mo&s;t Learned Ages of it, is like a <HI>Solemn Determination</HI> upon an <HI>Open Appeal</HI> made on the &s;ides of the <HI>Jews</HI> and Chri|&s;tians, again&s;t all the re&s;t of the World, in this mo&s;t Important and Fundamental Point of true Religion. Which Determination ought therefore to be own'd as the highe&s;t Atte&s;tation to that true Religion, and tho&s;e Original Records where|in it is contain'd, that could ea&s;ily be de&s;ir'd or

expected: And which accordingly ought to be allowed to be of the greate&s;t Weight and Moment po&s;&s;ible in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) That the Sacred Accounts of the <HI>Creation</HI> of the World out of a <HI>Chaos</HI>, when rightly un|der&s;tood, is exactly agreeable to the Frame of Nature, and the true Sy&s;tem of the Univer&s;e. That Account of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation which I mean, is this, That, taking the only Example which is in Nature of a real <HI>Chaos</HI>, I mean the <HI>Atmo&s;phere of a Comet</HI>, for the <HI>Mo&s;aick Chaos</HI>; and taking that Chaos or <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI>, not to be revolv'd about its own <HI>Axis</HI>, till after its Formation into a Planet, which Nature fully agrees to, and which would imply a <HI>Day</HI>, and a <HI>Year</HI>, to be all one, that
<Q>&startq;This <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Cre|ation, I &s;ay, is not a Nice and Philo&s;ophical Account of the Origin of all Things; but an Hi&s;torical and True Repre&s;entation of the Formation of our &s;ingle Earth out of that confu&s;ed Chaos, and of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive and vi&s;ible Changes thereof each Day, or Year, till it became fit for the Habitation of Man|&endq;kind.</Q>
Now as to this Matter, I have entirely prevented my &s;elf in my Preface to the <HI>New Theory of the Earth</HI>; wherein I have at large Di&s;cour&s;ed thereof; and I hope, in good Mea|&s;ure, to the Satisfaction of the Learned and In|qui&s;itive; whither therefore I mu&s;t in this Place refer my Readers. Only I &s;hall de&s;ire them to reflect here upon a few Things in Na|tural Knowledge thereto relating, which are peculiarly &s;uitable to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e; as highly confirming the Truth of the Sacred, or <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory of the Creation. The Things
<PB N="140" REF="181">
I mean are the&s;e Four; Fir&s;t Nature does now exhibit to us &s;uch a <HI>Chaos</HI> as that Hi&s;tory &s;up|po&s;es, for the Fund and Promptuary of our Earth; which till lately the World could not know, but by Revelation: Secondly, Nature does now &s;hew the Po&s;&s;ibility of the greater Length of the Periods, or Days of Creation, than tho&s;e of our ordinary Days, without which no Natural and Rational Account could be gi|ven of that Creation; and this con&s;i&s;tently with the Letter of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>, that tho&s;e Periods were &s;till, &s;trictly &s;peaking, <HI>Days</HI> at the &s;ame Time: Thirdly, Nature does now &s;o clearly &s;hew the Impo&s;&s;ibility of the <HI>Eternity</HI> of this Sy&s;tem, and much more of this particular Earth, in its pre&s;ent State, as prepares the way for the Belief of that Sacred Account of its Original Creation: And Fourthly, Nature does &s;o plainly &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ary Intere&s;t the Supreme Being has in all the ordinary Appearances of Nature, and in the Pre&s;ervation of the &s;everal Worlds now in being, as much more implies his Intere&s;t in the fir&s;t Original, and Primary Settlements of the &s;ame; and &s;uch as prepares us mo&s;t ea&s;ily to believe what <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> a&s;&s;erts of the Interpo&s;ition of <HI>Divine Power</HI>, and <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI>, and <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI>, in that whole Affair. The&s;e Ob&s;ervations de&s;erve a peculiar Regard; and A&s;tronomy does now, in the&s;e Re&s;pects, fully &s;upport and atte&s;t to the Sacred Accounts, thus rea&s;onably under&s;tood, again&s;t all the oppo&s;ite Notions of tho&s;e igno|rant or prejudic'd Philo&s;ophers, who pretended to give different Accounts of &s;uch Matters; and e&s;pecially again&s;t tho&s;e Two Famous Anti&s;crip|tural Hypothe&s;es of the <HI>Eternity</HI> of Things; and of their Original from meer <HI>Chance</HI> and
<PB N="141" REF="182">
<HI>Accident</HI>; both which, as we have already &s;hewn, are entirely confuted, and rendred not only incredible, but ridiculous, from the pre|&s;ent Knowledge we have of the true Sy&s;tem of the Univer&s;e. I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) That the Sacred <HI>Chronology</HI>, or Scripture Account of the Antiquity of the World, and its Duration &s;ince the Deluge, is right, and agree|able, not only to the mo&s;t certain Remains of Ancient Prophane Hi&s;tory, but to the be&s;t Methods which Nature and Philo&s;ophy afford us for the Di&s;covery of the &s;ame. I mean not only, that it appears from the true Sy&s;tem of the World, that neither the Whole, nor any Parts of the &s;ame, can have been &s;trictly <HI>ab aeterno</HI>, in their pre&s;ent Condition, of which before; but that the Antiquity of our pre&s;ent Earth, and its Inhabitants, whether taken from Ancient Pro|phane Tradition, and Hi&s;tory, or from the Phae|nomena of Nature, does be&s;t agree to the Sacred Accounts, which make it nearly 6000, or 7000 Years Old, and not more.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philo&s;. Tran&s;act. No. 346.</NOTE> Now as to this Matter, I mu&s;t own that a Per&s;on of very great Sagacity, has lately advanc'd a contrary Notion, from the Degree of Saltne&s;s of our pre&s;ent Ocean, compar'd with the Length of Time which he &s;uppo&s;es nece&s;&s;ary, according to his own Hypothe&s;is, to bring it to that Degree. Whence he &s;eems to think it to be much longer, not only than the Scripture Account of the Time &s;ince the Deluge; beyond which, I &s;hould think it in vain to extend any &s;uch Calculations; but much longer than the Time &s;ince the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation it &s;elf, as delivered in the &s;ame Scrip|ture; unle&s;s we extend the Duration of the Days of Creation to an immen&s;e Length, with|out
<PB N="142" REF="183">
any Authority for &s;o doing. But then, this Per&s;on allows all this to be built on an Hypo|the&s;is, an uncertain Hypothe&s;is, of the Origin of the Saltne&s;s of the Ocean; and he allows that &s;uch Trials have not been made, nor in|deed are now po&s;&s;ible to be made, as are nece&s;|&s;ary even on this Hypothe&s;is, to determine that Duration, in this or &s;everal future Ages. So that at the bottom the whole is, by his own Conce&s;&s;ions, very uncertain, and only built on &s;ome <HI>Su&s;picions</HI>, which it cannot be now known whether they have any Foundation in Nature or not. In which Ca&s;e, by the way, it had been but rea&s;onable to avoid the giving any Intimations to weaken the Sacred Chrology, unle&s;s there had been &s;ome real or &s;ure Evidence again&s;t it; which yet is not here pretended to. However, leaving this Notion, as not yet wor|thy of a direct Confutation, I venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the be&s;t ways of Determination we now have of the Age of the World, whether from Prophane Hi&s;tory, or the Phaenomena of Na|ture, do very well agree to the Sacred Chro|nology, and confirm us in the Belief that the Earth has not been in its pre&s;ent State above 6000 or 7000 Years; and that &s;ince the general Flood, there have &s;carce yet pa&s;&s;ed 5000 Years; according to the Sacred Chronology thereto relating. Now the be&s;t ways of know|ing this Duration of the World, ab&s;tractedly from Scripture, &s;eem to be the&s;e Five fol|lowing: (1.) By Ancient Prophane Hi&s;tories, directly relating to &s;uch Matters. (2.) By the Hi&s;tories of the Beginning and Progre&s;s of Arts and Sciences. (3.) By the Accounts of the Origin and &s;preading of the &s;everal Colonies of
<PB N="143" REF="184">
Nations all over the World. (4.) By the pre|&s;ent Number of Mankind upon the Face of the Earth, compar'd with the be&s;t Computations we have of the Time nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch their Increa&s;e and Doubling. (5.) By the pre&s;ent State of the Cele&s;tial Motions, and Terre&s;trial Appearances, and the Length of Time nece&s;&s;ary for any &s;uch Irregularities ari&s;ing therein, as would be &s;en&s;ible to us. As to the former Four Methods,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bochart Phaleg.</HI> L. C. J. <HI>Hale's</HI> Ori|gination of Mankind. See <HI>Chro|nol. Old Te&s;t.</HI> p. <HI>60. &mdash;68.</HI> E&s;&s;ay to re|&s;tore the true Text of the <HI>O. T. p. 195&mdash; 219.</HI></NOTE> which ju&s;tly pretend to the greate&s;t Nicety, they are not proper for this Place; and they have been &s;o fully examin'd already by others, or by my &s;elf el&s;ewhere, and found &s;o well to agree to the forementioned Inter|vals, that I believe judicious Men mu&s;t pro|nounce upon the whole, they are con&s;iderable Atte&s;tations to this Sacred Chronology. But as to the la&s;t Method, the Con&s;ideration of the Cele&s;tial Motions, and Terre&s;trial Appearances, I do not know that they can determine to any Degree of Exactne&s;s, how long they have con|tinued in their pre&s;ent State. Only thus far, that none of tho&s;e Motions or Phaenomena do contradict the Sacred Accounts, and that they all &s;hew that the World cannot have been very much older than tho&s;e Accounts affirm. Thus the Moon's Men&s;trual Motion mu&s;t be gradually &s;topped by the Aether, or fine Medium in which it revolves about the Earth: But then this is hitherto &s;o perfectly In&s;en&s;ible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Princip. <HI>2</HI>d Edit. p. <HI>481</HI></NOTE> that Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t that di&s;|covered any Occa&s;ion in A&s;tronomy, for making the lea&s;t Allowance for any Inequality in that Mo|tion. Thus the Earth's and Moon's Annual Motion mu&s;t be gradually retarded by the &s;ame Re&s;i&s;tance; yet &s;o &s;mall has this hitherto been,
<PB N="144" REF="185" MS="Y">
that the A&s;tronomers have not yet ob&s;erved it. Thus the Con&s;equence of the Retardation of the Earth's Diurnal Motion; which mu&s;t al&s;o in length of Time ari&s;e from the &s;ame Re&s;i&s;tance, would be the receding of the Sea from the Dry Land in the Torrid, and its overflowing it in the Frigid Zones:] Unle&s;s the Earth be fluid within, and &s;o accommodates it &s;elf to &s;uch Alterations] which is not yet in the lea&s;t ob&s;ervable. Thus the Fluids of our Earth are found gradually to dimini&s;h; yet is this &s;o very incon&s;iderable hi|therto, as no way to be di&s;tinctly found by any inconveniences ari&s;ing from it. Thus the Moun|tains do, for certain, wa&s;h away, and are dimi|ni&s;h'd; and the Valleys receive what the others lo&s;e, and are augmented: Yet do not we hither|to ob&s;erve any notable Inequalities ari&s;ing therefrom. In &s;hort, all &s;uch defects, decays, or irregularities, which mu&s;t in length of Time, according to the &s;ettled Laws of Nature, ari&s;e in our pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, appear to have been hitherto &s;o very &s;mall and incon&s;iderable, &s;ince the beginning of this Settlement, that we have thereby certain Evidence that its Age cannot be very much greater; and no Evidence that it is at all greater than what is contain'd in the Satred Chronology. Which Thing, how con|&s;iderable a Confirmation it is of that Chrono|logy, I leave to the Impartial to determine. I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="4">(4.) That the Sacred Accounts of the Muta|tion from the <HI>Paradi&s;iacal State</HI> before, to the <HI>Antediluvium one</HI>, after the Fall of Man, is agreeable to the State of Nature, and the true Frame of the World. That God, when he fir&s;t made Man upon this Earth, placed him in
<PB N="145" REF="186">
Paradi&s;e; that He there gave him a Law for the Tryal of his Obedience; that Man did tran&s;|gre&s;s that Law; that this Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was oc|ca&s;ion'd by the Temptation of the Old Serpent the Devil and Satan; and by the fir&s;t Compli|ance of the Wife, and by her Per&s;ua&s;ion of her Husband; that they were thereupon ca&s;t out of Paradi&s;e, and the happy State of Nature was much altered for the wor&s;e; that the Serpent was accur&s;ed, and &s;ubjected at la&s;t to the Pow|er of the Seed of the Woman; that the Ground was al&s;o cur&s;ed, and made to bring forth Thorns and Bryars, and not to bring forth its Fruit without the extraordinary Toil and Sweat of Mankind; that the Female &s;hould be in greater Subjection to the Male than otherwi&s;e &s;he &s;hould have been, and than many other Females now are; that &s;he &s;hould have greater Sorrow in the Con|ception and Bearing of her Offspring than other|wi&s;e &s;he &s;hould have had, and than any other Females now have; and that ever afterwards the Race of Men &s;hould have al&s;o &s;uch a Sen&s;e of Shame, or <HI>pudor circa res venereas</HI>, as they had not before, and as is not in other Animals; and withal more con&s;tant Inclinations that way than tho&s;e Animals have; all which has come to pa&s;s accordingly, as &s;tanding Memori|$ls of the Truth of this Ancient Hi&s;tory of the Original State and Circum&s;tances of Mankind: For all this we have not only the&s;e natural Tokens, but the certain Affirmation of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory, as all along &s;uppo&s;ed and confirmed in the Heathen Traditions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Gen. i, ii, iii.</P>
<P><HI>See t$e Commenta|tors there.</HI></P></NOTE> and in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and Chri&s;tian Revelations, as has been &s;hewn by others. But then, what the <HI>Altera|tion</HI> in the State of the Earth and of Nature
<PB N="146" REF="187">
could be, the Philo&s;ophy and A&s;tronomy of former Ages was utterly at a Lo&s;s to determine, till upon the Con&s;ideration of that Matter, and the Compari&s;on of Scripture and Nature, now better under&s;tood, together, I di&s;covered that the commencing of the Earth's Diurnal Rotati|on, not at the beginning of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Crea|tion, but after the Earth's compleat Formation, and after the Fall of Man, would give the Be&s;t, the mo&s;t Rational, and Philo&s;ophical Account of this Alteration of all other; and I di&s;covered, that this later Time of its Commencement would be&s;t agree, not only with the Sacred Ac|counts, but with the Ancient Profane Traditi|ons, and with the pre&s;ent Phaenomena of Na|ture al&s;o. All which I have long ago di&s;cour&s;ed of in my <HI>New Theory of the Earth</HI>; to which I mu&s;t therefore refer my Reader for &s;atisfacti|on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hypoth. iii. <HI>p.</HI> 85.118.</NOTE> Only I &s;hall de&s;ire him in particular to take notice of what is there e&s;pecially in&s;i&s;ted on under this Head,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P.</HI> 109, 110.</NOTE> and which is peculiarly pro|per to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, and that is, Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>'s Inferences from the Variation of the Needle's Declination from the <HI>North</HI>, and of Mine from the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory of the Crea|tion and Fall of Man, relating to the Time and Circum&s;tances of this Commencement of the Earth's Diurnal Revolution; and thence to ob|&s;erve how exactly they both agree together.

This is too large a Subject to be duly treated of in this Place. But I beg of the Inqui&s;itive Reader, that he will carefully weigh the very probable Solution I long &s;ince gave of that De|luge of <HI>Noah</HI>, from the Approach of a Comet, before I &s;o much as hoped for the Knowledge of that very Comet which did &s;o approach to it, and did cau&s;e the &s;ame; and that he will con|&s;ider the &s;trong additional Evidence &s;ince ari&s;en from the knowledge of that very Comet which did certainly approach to us on or about that very Year, and on or about that very Day of the Year, when the Sacred and Profane Accounts agree that Deluge began. If this be not &s;ati&s;|factory

Evidence in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, I do not well know what Evidence will be &s;o e&s;teem'd. For my &s;elf, I mu&s;t profe&s;s, that while I look on the Solution of the other Phaenomena under this Chapter as remarkahle enough, and com|monly not a little probable al&s;o; I cannot but look on the Solution of the Deluge by that very Comet, which I my &s;elf &s;aw <HI>A. D.</HI> 1680, 1681, to be in a manner certain; and by Con&s;equence I cannot but e&s;teem the Evidence thence ari|&s;ing, for the Truth of the Sacred Hi&s;tory in this important Ca&s;e, exceeding &s;trong and &s;atisfactory. Nor do I think, that &s;o unexpected and emi|nent an Atte&s;tation, as that of the Circum&s;tances and Period of this Comet, for &s;olving the De|luge, lately di&s;covered, mo&s;t certainly is, has ever happened to any &s;o &s;trange an Hypothe&s;is before, &s;ince the World began; which Thing cannot but be highly plea&s;ing to my &s;elf; and I think is highly worthy of the Ob&s;ervation of others al&s;o.

<P N="6">(6.) That the Sacred Accounts of the <HI>Invi|&s;ible World</HI>, or of good Angels, and wicked Dae|mons, their Places and Mini&s;trations, is ex|actly agreeable to the true Sy&s;tem and Phaeno|mena of Nature. Now that the Sacred and Prophane Accounts, and the Hi&s;tories of all Nations and Ages, do &s;uppo&s;e and inform us, that be&s;ides the Supreme Invi&s;ible Deity, be|&s;ides the Vi&s;ible Material World of Bodies, and be&s;ides the Invi&s;ible and Incorporeal World of Souls or Spirits, inhabiting in Vi&s;ible and Gro&s;s Bodies, there are al&s;o another Spe|cies of Beings belonging to our Sy&s;tem: I mean, tho&s;e Souls, or Spiritual Beings, who are either wholly free from Bodies,
<PB N="149" REF="190">
or rather free from &s;uch Gro&s;s and Vi&s;ible Bodies as we have, but inhabit ordinarily in purer and more etherial Regions, in more &s;ub|tle and aerial Bodies or Vehicles; who are In|vi&s;ible generally, and Intangible to our gro&s;s Sen&s;es, but not wholly Incorporeal, or uncon|cerned with us and our Affairs here below; that, I &s;ay, the Ancient, Sacred and Prophane Ac|counts, and Hi&s;tories, do a&s;&s;ure us of the Exi|&s;tence of the&s;e Species of Beings, every body that has ever read either Ancient or Modern Books, cannot deny or doubt. But that pre|&s;ent Nature does at all favour the&s;e Accounts, and that we can give the lea&s;t Evidence from the Phaenomena of the World, of their Being, or Place of Abode, or Influence here below, is what is not generally pretended to by even the Chri&s;tian Philo&s;ophers. Now in this Ca&s;e I &s;hall venture a Step farther, and &s;hall here &s;et down &s;uch Ob&s;ervations from Nature and A&s;tronomy, as &s;eem to me to favour this Ac|count of the Invi&s;ible World. Accordingly I ob&s;erve, (1.) That Nature does as fully allow of the Exi&s;tence of Spiritual and Invi&s;ible Be|ings <HI>out</HI> of gro&s;s Bodies, as <HI>in</HI> them. Nor can tho&s;e who are convinc'd by the Phaenomena of Animals, both Irrational and Rational, that they are compounded of Immaterial and Invi|&s;ible Souls, as well as of Material and Vi&s;ible Bodies, as we have already di&s;cours'd, at all &s;cruple the Exi&s;tence of &s;uch Spiritual and In|vi&s;ible Souls, either by them&s;elves, or united to much finer Bodies than tho&s;e of our gro&s;s Ani|mals here below. I ob&s;erve, (2.) That Nature does favour the Exi&s;tence of &s;uch Creatures, by &s;hewing us &s;uch large and noble Regions of the

World, as be&s;t of all &s;uit the Habitation of &s;uch Beings; and which, if there be not &s;uch Beings, &s;eem, contrary to the u&s;ual Ca&s;e of the other Parts of the Sy&s;tem, to be wholly de&s;ti|tute of Inhabitants: I mean all the wide Spaces of the Atmo&s;pheres of the Planets, e&s;pecially tho&s;e &s;till, calm, clear, and aethereal Regions of the &s;ame which are above the Clouds, and Storms, and Di&s;orders of their lowe&s;t Parts. Nature, as we &s;till find, abounds in all proper Places with Living Creatures, not only on the Earth, or dry Land, but within the Earth, and Waters, and lowe&s;t Air, every where; all made to enjoy their Creator's Bounty, and to be &s;er|viceable to other Beings Superior to them|&s;elves. What Rea&s;on can there then be to &s;up|po&s;e that this Air, the noble&s;t Fluid in the Univer&s;e, even in its pure&s;t and mo&s;t Cele&s;tial Parts, &s;hould be de&s;titute of Living Inhabitants; which yet it mu&s;t be, in ca&s;e we exclude tho&s;e <HI>Invi&s;ible Powers</HI> above-mentioned. Now, in order to &s;hew how little Prejudice to the Exi|&s;tence of &s;uch Beings, that Circum&s;tance of their being <HI>Invi&s;ible</HI>, ought here to be; I ob|&s;erve, (3.) That whatever proper Inhabitants the Air has, their very Bodies ought to be <HI>Invi&s;ible</HI>, becau&s;e the Air it &s;elf, whereof we may &s;uppo&s;e them made, is ever &s;o. This is the wonderful Property of Air, &s;trictly &s;peaking, and that Property, which among all Corporeal Beings, otherwi&s;e &s;en&s;ible, &s;eems al|mo&s;t peculiar to it, that it is ever, upon the ut|mo&s;t Conden&s;ation po&s;&s;ible, ab&s;olutely to us <HI>In|vi&s;ible</HI>. Whence 'tis no wonder that all &s;uch Be|ings as live in it, and perhaps take their Bodies from it, how real or powerful &s;o ever, are

likewi&s;e ordinarily <HI>Invi&s;ible</HI> to us. I ob&s;erve, (4.) That the known Phaenomena of our Air &s;eem in a peculiar Manner, to require and &s;uppo&s;e the Exi&s;tence and Agency of &s;uch In|vi&s;ible Beings therein, as we are here &s;peaking of; and cannot be fairly and mechanically &s;olv'd without them. This I have particularly taken Notice of, in my Account of the un|u&s;ual Meteors lately &s;een in our Air, to which I refer the Reader. Nor do I find that any other Philo&s;ophers are able to give us a better Account of tho&s;e Aerial Phaenomena,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Dr.</HI> Halley<HI>'s Account of this</HI> Phae|nomenon, Tran&s;act. Philo&s;oph. <HI>No.</HI> 34.7.</NOTE> without that Hypothe&s;is. So I cannot but conclude, that the Appearances of Nature do in this, as well as in other Ca&s;es, atte&s;t to what Di&s;co|veries Divine Revelation has made relating thereto: And that there are Good and Bad Spirits in the Air, in our Neighbourhood, ready to perform what the Sacred Writings a&s;cribe to them. As to the other Place allotted for certain to &s;ome, now to us, Invi&s;ible Beings, in Scripture, I mean <HI>in the Heart of the Earth</HI>; I have already made it probable from Natural Philo&s;ophy, that the Heavenly Bodies have &s;uch mighty Cavities within, as are the proper Receptacles for &s;ome &s;uch Beings; and &s;hall not need here to enlarge on that Subject; e&s;pecially &s;ince it will come again to be con&s;i|dered under the Tenth Particular hereafter.

Now in this ca&s;e the Contention is only about a Word. For while 'tis certain that the World is the Work of a Mind, and of Rea&s;on, what you call <HI>Nature</HI> I call <HI>God the Creator</HI>. And clear it is, that neither formerly nor now could it be, that either the Species of Bo|dies, adorn'd with &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;tinctions or the Faculties of the Mind, &s;hould be made by any Labour, without Rea&s;on, and without Sen&s;e. And now, if you look on the Philo&s;ophers as proper Witne&s;&s;es in this ca&s;e, <HI>Plato</HI> gives us his Te&s;timony in his <HI>Timaeus;</HI> where in his di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of this Que&s;tion, about the Frame of the World, Whether it always was, or had a Be|ginning, he pronounces that it was made. For, &s;ays he, 'tis vi&s;ible, palpable, and corporeal; and all things of that Nature were certainly made. Now what was made, has without que&s;tion &s;ome Author by whom it was made. But then, as he adds, To di&s;cover this Maker and Parent of all Things, is no ea&s;y thing; and when you have di&s;cover'd him, to impart your di&s;covery to the vulgar, is plainly impo&s;&s;ible. The&s;e are certainly <HI>Plato</HI>'s words. But &s;uppo|&s;ing that he and the other Philo&s;ophers among the <HI>Greeks</HI> had been di&s;pos'd to &s;ay nothing about the making of the World, would it not &s;till be a plain ca&s;e to all that had common Un|der&s;tanding? For what Man is there, I mean one of at lea&s;t &s;ome &s;mall Capacity, who upon the &s;ight of an Hou&s;e with all its Furniture fit|ted for Mens various Nece&s;&s;ities, who&s;e Top is

And can any one be found &s;o fooli&s;h, as upon the &s;ight of the Work of Heaven, and the view of the &s;plendor of the Sun and Moon, the regular Cour&s;e of the Stars, with their various Kinds and Motions, and that &s;ees all determin'd by proper Laws, and to &s;uitable Periods; to for|bear to cry out, that the&s;e things were made by a wi&s;e and rational Artificer, or rather by Wi&s;|dom and Rea&s;on it &s;elf?</P>
<P>But now if you de&s;ire to be a Follower of others of the <HI>Greek</HI> Philo&s;ophers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.21.</NOTE> and are vers'd in Mechanicks, what they deliver about the&s;e Cele&s;tial things mu&s;t have certainly come to your knowledge: For they &s;uppo&s;e that the Heavens are like a Sphere, on every &s;ide evenly &s;ituate, and having the &s;ame re&s;pect to every part, and equally di&s;tant from the Center of the Earth; and that therefore they &s;tand &s;o firm by the equality of their Libration, that the evenne&s;s of their Situation does not allow them to bend any one way more than another; and that by this means the Sphere is &s;u&s;tain'd with|out any prop to &s;upport it. Now if this Ma|chine of the World bears really this Simili|tude, there is a clear demon&s;tration of Divine Workman&s;hip therein.

Who is there, I &s;ay, but mu&s;t pronounce the Divine Wi&s;dom it &s;elf to be the Manager of &s;o regular a Sy&s;tem?

For therefore are there high Mountains in &s;ome certain Places in every part of the World, that the Air which is, as it were, compre&s;s'd and &s;traiten'd by them, may, according to the ap|pointment of God, be crowded and forc'd out

for Winds; whereby the Fruits grow, and the Heat of Summer is temper'd, at the time when the warm <HI>Plciades</HI> are heated by the fiercene&s;s of the Sun.

Pray how could the Fruits of the Earth, which are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the U&s;es of Mankind, be ripen'd without it? Be&s;ides, take notice of another Thing, that near the <HI>Equator</HI>, where the greate&s;t Heat is, there is no great compre&s;&s;ion of the Clouds; nor does any mighty quantity of Rain fall there, leet it &s;hould breed Di&s;ea&s;es among the Inhabitants. For moi&s;t Clouds, if they be as it were bak'd with an inten&s;e Heat, do render the Air corrupt and Pe&s;tilential. As al&s;o the Earth, when it re|ceives over-warm Rain, does not afford Nouri&s;h|ment to the Corn, burt de&s;troys it. Which Ma|nagement who can doubt but 'tis the Effect of the Divine Providence?

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.25.</NOTE>What &s;hall I &s;ay about Plants and about Ani|mals? Is it not the Effect of Providence, that when they are to be di&s;&s;olv'd by Old Age, the Plants &s;hould be repair'd again, either by young Plants, or by Seeds, which proceed from them|&s;elves; and the Animals by the Propagation of Po&s;terity? And indeed, 'tis by the &s;urprizing Conduct of Providence, that Milk is provided in the Brea&s;ts again&s;t the time when the Young one is born, and that the &s;ame young one, as &s;oon as 'tis born, without any In&s;tructor, knows where to look for the Places wherein its Nou|ri&s;hment is laid up for it. And then Males as well as Females are brought forth; that by the means of both, Po&s;terity may be provided for. But now le&s;t, as Men are ready to imagine, the&s;e Events might &s;eem to happen according to &s;ome fix'd Cour&s;e of Nature, and not by the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Creator, he ordain'd that &s;ome few Creatures &s;hould propagate their Kind upon Earth after a different manner, for an In|dication and Sign of his Providence: That for Example, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">A few of the&s;e Ex|amples, which were generally be|liev'd in the Days of our Author, are now &s;ou$d $o have been Mi&s;takes; b$t &s;o that a va&s;t $word$ of others, of equal or greater Force, have been &s;ince $span$</NOTE> the Raven &s;hould bring forth her

<P>And indeed to what Purpo&s;e &s;hould I recken up more Examples wherein the Divine Provi|dence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.26.</NOTE> by changing that Cour&s;e which is &s;up|pos'd to be appointed by Nature, has in many Re&s;pects varied the Circum&s;tances of the Birth of Animals? Whereby might be &s;hew'd not any irrational Cour&s;e of Things, but God the Di|&s;po&s;er of all Things might rationally be demon|&s;trated. Is there not al&s;o in another In&s;tance, a compleat Demon&s;tration of the Workman&s;hip of Divine Providence? In that I mean, when Seeds that are &s;own are repair'd for the U&s;es of Human Life? Which Seeds when they are committed to the Ground, the Soil, by the Will of God, affords them that Moi&s;ture it has receiv'd, as if it were Milk for their Nou|ri&s;hment. For there is in the Waters a certain Power of the Spirit of God, which was afforded them at the beginning, by who&s;$ Efficiency the
<PB N="186" REF="227">
entire future Body begins to be form'd in the very Seed, and to be re&s;tor'd again by its Stem and its Ear: For when a grain of the Seeds is &s;well'd by the Moi&s;ture, that Power of the Spi|rit which was be&s;tow'd on the Waters, and being incorporeal ea&s;ily runs through certain narrow Channels of the Veins, invigorates the Seeds till they grow larger, and frames the Species of them as they grow. It comes to pa&s;s therefore that by the Means of the moi&s;t Element, where|in this vital Spirit is ever in&s;erted and implant|ed, that not only the Corn is repair'd in gene|ral, but that it returns again, as to its Species and Form, entirely like tho&s;e Seeds which were &s;ow'd. Which Regularity of Operation, who that has the lea&s;t Sen&s;e can believe to be thus perform'd by an irrational Nature, and not by the Divine Wi&s;dom? To conclude, Even the&s;e Things are form'd after the &s;imilitude of a Human Birth; for the Earth appears to retain the Place of the Womb, where the Seed when it is ca&s;t into it, is form'd and nouri&s;h'd by the Power of Water and of the Spirit, as we have &s;aid already.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.27.</NOTE>Moreover, the Divine Providence is herein al&s;o to be admir'd, that it has order'd all, &s;o that we can indeed &s;ee and know what is made; but how, and after what manner it is made, is hidden and conceal'd from us; that they may not be di&s;coverable by tho&s;e that are unworthy, but may be di&s;clos'd to &s;uch as are worthy and faithful, and have merited &s;uch a Favour. Now that we may prove by Experiments and In&s;tan|ces, that the Seeds do not receive any Part of the Terrene Matter, but are made up entirely of the Element of Water, and of the Virtue of
<PB N="187" REF="228">
that Spirit which is included therein; Do you &s;uppo&s;e, for Example's Sake, that the Weight of an Hundred Talents of Earth were put into a large Ve&s;&s;el; and the &s;everal Kinds of Seeds were &s;ow'd therein, either of Herbs, or of larger Plants; and that they had a &s;ufficient Quantity of Water to moi&s;ten them; and let this Proce&s;s be continued &s;everal Years. And then let the Grain which has &s;prung from them, &s;uppo&s;e of Wheat or Barley, or of any other &s;ort, be ga|ther'd together, every Year's Product by it &s;elf, till the Heap of every Kind of Grain is ari&s;en to the Weight of an Hundred Talents. Then let the Trees them&s;elves be pluck'd up, and weigh'd; and when they are all taken out of the Ve&s;&s;el, yet will the Earth it &s;elf, when it is weigh'd, afford you its entire original Hundred Talents again notwith&s;tanding. Whence then &s;hall we &s;ay that all that Weight, and all that Quantity of different Sorts of Grain, and of the Trees has ari&s;en? Is it not plain that 'tis from the Water? For the Earth retains its own en|tirely, while the Water which was poured on every one of them, wholly di&s;appears; and all this by the powerful Efficacy of the Divine Di&s;po&s;al of the Creator, which by the very Element of Water both repairs the Sub&s;tances, and frames the Species of &s;uch Seeds and Plants, and pre&s;erves their Species with great In|crea&s;e.</P>
<P>From all which In&s;tances I think it is abun|dantly evident to all Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">viii.28.</NOTE> that all Things are made, and every Thing does &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the Skill of a wi&s;e Being, and not by the Opera|tion of Brutal Nature.

of a Man, who is a little World included in the other: And let us con&s;ider with what Art he is compounded, and thereby you will &s;ee in an e&s;pecial Manner the Wi&s;dom of the Crea|tor. Now though he be made up of different Sub&s;tances, of that which is Mortal, and that which is Immortal, yet by the Skill and Provi|dence of his Creator is it brought to pa&s;s that the&s;e different Sub&s;tances, which are &s;o widely remote one from the other, admit of an Union; For one Part is taken from the Earth, and fram'd by the Creator; while the other is deriv'd from the Immortal Sub|&s;tances. And yet is the Advantage of Im|mortality not at all infring'd by &s;uch a Con|junction. Nor is he made up of rational, and concupi&s;cible, and ira&s;cible Parts; but &s;uch &s;orts of Faculties as tho&s;e, are rather to be &s;uppos'd Affections belonging to him; whereby he may be carried to tho&s;e &s;everal &s;orts of Objects. For the Body, which con|&s;i&s;ts of Bones and Fle&s;h, owes its Original to the Seed of the Male, which Heat fetches out of the Marrow, and con&s;igns over to the Womb, as to a proper Soil, whereto it ad|heres: And when it has by little and lit|tle been moi&s;ten'd, by the flowing of the Blood to it, it becomes Fle&s;h and Bones; and is made up after the Species of him who ca&s;t in the Seed.</P>

<HEAD>PART IX. A <HI>Recapitulation</HI> of the Whole: With a &s;erious <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> to all, e&s;pecially to the <HI>Scepticks</HI> and <HI>Unbelievers</HI> of our <HI>Age</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>_AND now, Reader, who&s;oever thou art, e&s;pecially if thou bee&s;t a Scep|tick, or Unbeliever, either as to Natural or Revealed Religion, I beg of thee &s;eriou&s;ly to look back upon what has been hitherto Di&s;cour&s;ed on $he Behalf of them both; even from the certain Principles of A&s;tronomy, or the true Sy&s;tem of $he World; and from tho&s;e numerous Te&s;ti|monies of Sacred and Prophane Antiquity, which &s;hew us the natural Con&s;equences of $ch wonderful Phaenomena. I &s;ay, look $ack <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly</HI> upon this View of the Univer&s;e $efore us, and its Con&s;equences. For if ever $ere be Occa&s;ion for <HI>Seriou&s;ne&s;s</HI>, it is here, $here our <HI>All</HI> is at Stake; where our future, $r final Weal, or Woe, Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery,
<PB N="242" REF="283">
are the Things under Examination. For ac|cordingly as we &s;hall determine our &s;elves in this grand Enquiry, concerning the Being and Providence of God, the Immortality of our Souls, and the Truth of Divine Revelation, as to the la&s;ting Rewards and Puni&s;hments of another World; &s;o &s;hall we be oblig'd to be|have our &s;elves in our Conduct; upon which our Eternal State is to be awarded us at the great Day. For we cannot but be &s;en&s;ible that no Mi&s;take of our own can alter the Nature of Things; and that they are not the mo&s;t zealous Wi&s;hes, and Inclinations; the mo&s;t pungent Je&s;ts and Banter; the mo&s;t Prophane and Impious Bla&s;phemy again&s;t God, his At|tributes, or Providence, that can in the lea&s;t alter the Sy&s;tem of the Univer&s;e, or bani&s;h the Supreme Creator and Governor, with his Pro|vidence and Laws, out of it. Let us con&s;ider, then, that all the other Hypothe&s;es relating to the Con&s;titution of the World, invented by either <HI>Democritus, Epicurus, Ari&s;totle, Pto|lemy, Tycho, Cartes</HI>, Mr. <HI>Hobbs</HI>, or <HI>Spinoza</HI>, d$ now plainly appear, from certain Evidence, t$ be not only fal&s;e, but ab&s;urd; contrary bot$ to common Sen&s;e, and to the known Laws an$ Ob&s;ervations of &s;ound Philo&s;ophy; and tha$ he who will now be an <HI>Athei&s;t</HI>, mu&s;t be an ab+&s;olute <HI>Ignoramus</HI> in Natural Knowledge; mu$ neither under&s;tand the Principles either of Phy$+&s;icks or A&s;tronomy. Let us con&s;ider farthe$ that as to <HI>Dei&s;m</HI>, or the Denial of the Scrip+tures, and of Divine Revelation, it is really I Mens <HI>la&s;t Refuge</HI>, and taken up of late, n$ by hone&s;t Enquirers impartially &s;earching aft$ Truth, and di&s;covering upon Evidence, th$
<PB N="243" REF="284">
all Revealed Religion is fal&s;e; but that it is chiefly fallen into of late by &s;ome Irreligious Per&s;ons, in the Di&s;tre&s;s of their Affairs, and upon that &s;urprizing and overbearing Light, which Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s wonderful Di&s;coveries have afforded; whereby they have perceiv'd that Natural Religion, with its Foundations, were now become too certain to bear any far|ther Oppo&s;ition. That this is true, I appeal to a certain Club of Per&s;ons, not over religi|ou&s;ly di&s;pos'd, who being &s;oberly asked, after Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>'s remarkable Sermons at Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Lectures, built upon Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Di&s;coveries, and levell'd again&s;t the prevailing Athei&s;m of the Age, <HI>What they had to &s;ay in their own Vindication again&s;t the Evidence pro|duc'd by Dr.</HI> Bentley? The An&s;wer was, <HI>That truly they did not well know what to &s;ay again&s;t it, upon the Head of Athei&s;m: But what</HI>, &s;ay they, <HI>is this, to the Fable of Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</HI> And in Confirmation of this Account, it may, I be|lieve, be ju&s;tly ob&s;erv'd, that the pre&s;ent gro&s;s <HI>Dei&s;m</HI>, or the Oppo&s;ition that has of late &s;o evidently and barefacedly appear'd again&s;t Di|vine Revelation, and the Holy Scriptures, has taken its Date in &s;ome Mea&s;ure from that Time. And as to the main Ob&s;ervation which I am now upon, I mean that this modern Infidelity is not properly owing to any new Di&s;covery of the want of real Evidence for Reveal'd Religion, or of the Fal&s;ity of any of the known Foundations of it; but to the like Nece&s;&s;ity of Affairs, and the Impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;upporting the former, and wor&s;er Notions, I think is plain from the&s;e Two farther Con&s;iderations: Fir&s;t, That the mo&s;t truly Learned, the deepe&s;t Enquirers, and
<PB N="244" REF="285">
mo&s;t Sagacious Examiners into Reveal'd Reli|gion, have in this Age, as well as in all the foregoing, declar'd them&s;elves in Favour of it, both by their Conduct, and by their Writings; while the Generality of the <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> are known to be &s;o Overly and Superficial in their Learning, about &s;uch Matters, as renders them indeed &s;ometimes the Scare-crows of the Ignorant, but gnerally the Contempt of the really Judicious and Learned Chri&s;tians. Secondly, That they have, for &s;ome Time, almo&s;t di&s;carded the principal way of Examination into the main Evi|dence for the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and Chri&s;tian Revelations, I mean Ancient Facts and Te&s;timonies; which they would never have done, had they not been well a&s;&s;ur'd that &s;uch Sort of Arguments would not be for their Service. However, I &s;hall wave this, as &s;omewhat Foreign to my pre&s;ent Undertaking, and proceed to that <HI>Recapitulation</HI> of what I have alledg'd in this Treati&s;e, on the Behalf of the Being, and the Attributes, and the Providence of God, of the Immortality of Human Souls, and of the &s;everal important Points of Natural and Reveal'd Religion already treated of, which I propo&s;ed to make in this Place.</P>
<P>We have then here, Good Reader, &s;een a wonderful, a &s;urprizing, an amazing Sy&s;tem. or rather an innumerable Number of &s;uch Sy&s;tems of Worlds; <HI>i. e.</HI> of Suns, of Pla|nets, Primary and Secondary, and of Comets, with their &s;everal Atmo&s;pheres, all placed at immen&s;e Di&s;tances from one another; in vari|ous Po&s;itions, Velocities, and Periods; in divers Circum&s;tances and Magnitudes, ordain'd for &s;e|veral great U&s;es, and admitting dfferent particu|lar Laws; but &s;o as every where to be &s;ubject to
<PB N="245" REF="286">
one Univer&s;al <HI>Power of Gravity</HI>, or mutual Tendency of all the Parts to one another, and that of a certain Quantity, and in certain Proportions. A Power this, amazing to think of! yet Undeniable, Regular, Univer&s;al as to Time, Place, and Bodies; and &s;till Exact and Geometrical; yet at the &s;ame Time entirely and ab&s;olutely Immechanical, or beyond all Material Solutions, and Pretence of Material Solutions what&s;oever; and indeed the proper Effect of the Supreme Being. We have &s;een, that accordingly this Immen&s;e World, or Innu|merable Number of Immen&s;e Worlds, are for certain all <HI>God's Worlds</HI>; or Created, Governed, and Provided for by One God, by One Supreme, Omnipotent and Omni&s;cient Being; ever Pre|&s;ent to all its Parts; and ever exerting his In|finite Power, Wi&s;dom, and Goodne&s;s every where therein. We have &s;een that the noble&s;t Principles of Natural Religion are Fully and Demon&s;tratively deriv'd from the Phaenomena of the&s;e Sy&s;tems; and that not a few of the mo&s;t Concerning, and otherwi&s;e mo&s;t Excep|tionable Parts of Divine Revelation, are al&s;o &s;trongly confirm'd thereby. Nor is there now the lea&s;t room for either of tho&s;e Ancient Refuges of Athei&s;m and Irreligion; I mean the wild Hypothe&s;es of the <HI>Eternity of the World</HI>; and of its Temporary Derivation from the <HI>Ac|cidental Concour&s;e of Atoms</HI>. All this we have now <HI>&s;een</HI> with our Eyes, and as it were, <HI>felt</HI> with our Hands, in the foregoing Treati&s;e. We have al&s;o there ob&s;erv'd and prov'd, that this wonderful Sy&s;tem of Things is not any bare Hypothe&s;is, or meerly <HI>probable Account</HI> of the Heavenly Bodies, and their Motions,
<PB N="246" REF="287">
but the <HI>certain Theory</HI> of them, atte&s;ted to be &s;uch by unque&s;tionable Evidence, from A&s;$|nomical Ob&s;ervations, and from &s;ure Geome|trical Rea&s;onings thereupon. So that the Con|clu&s;ions regularly drawn from &s;uch Premi&s;es, ought them&s;elves to be look'd on as <HI>Certain</HI>. We have there al&s;o di&s;tinctly followed the Steps of Nature, and drawn out her grand Secrets into plain Tables, for the U&s;e of every body; even of tho&s;e who are not Mathematicians good enough to Calculate them&s;elves. And have farther given the Manner and Rea&s;on of each Operation, for every ones entire Sati&s;|faction. Nor need my Readers take even the <HI>Lemmata</HI> them&s;elves for granted, if they un|der&s;tand but &s;ome Elements of Geometry. For they are demon&s;trated every one in my <HI>Ma|thematical Philo&s;ophy</HI>, and that generally after &s;o plain a Manner, that I dare &s;ay very or|dinary Mathematicians will be able to under|&s;tand tho&s;e Demon&s;trations. By the&s;e Calcu|lations it is that we arrive at the compleate&s;t and mo&s;t exact Knowledge of this <HI>Noble</HI>, this <HI>Amazing</HI>, this <HI>Divine Sy&s;tem</HI>. Nor can I ima|gine that the Inqui&s;itive Reader, when he has well con&s;ider'd the Particulars, will think that any of tho&s;e Epithets, <HI>Noble, Amazing</HI>, and <HI>Divine</HI>, are by me wrong apply'd in this Mat|ter. For here we di&s;cover that all the Hea|venly Bodies <HI>Revolve</HI> in tho&s;e mo&s;t agreeable Geometrical Curves, the <HI>Ellip&s;es</HI>; the Planets in tho&s;e that are very little Eccentrical; and the Comets in tho&s;e that are prodigiou&s;ly &s;o; even in &s;uch as are almo&s;t Parabolical. By which known and Regular Orbits, we readily reduce their Motions to Calculation, and ea&s;ily
<PB N="247" REF="288" MS="Y">
di&s;cover the Law of Gravity belonging to them. Here we contemplate the <HI>Periods</HI> of all the Pla|nets Primary and Secondary, and of the Comets, about their Central Bodies, from the &s;malle&s;t Pe|riod of the Innermo&s;t Circumjovial of 42 Hours and a half; to the large&s;t of the outmo&s;t Comet of 575 Years. Here we take a View of the va&s;t middle <HI>Di&s;tances</HI> of all the Planets, Primary, and Secondary, and of the Comets, from their Cen|tral Bodies, deriv'd from the be&s;t Ob&s;ervations, from the lea&s;t of the innermo&s;t Circumjovials of 1$$.000, to the greate&s;t of the utmo&s;t Comet of 5.600,000,000 Miles; the lea&s;t of which di&s;tances does prodigiou&s;ly &s;urpa&s;s the Power of Human Imagination, which can no way enlarge it &s;elf to any &s;uch mea&s;ures. Here al&s;o we may di&s;cover the &s;urprizing <HI>Magnitudes</HI> of the &s;everal Bodies belonging to our Sy&s;tem, both in Diameter, Superficies, and Solidity, from the &s;maller Quantities in our Moon, of 2170 Miles Diameter; 14,000.000 &s;quare Miles of Surface; and 5.000,000.000 cubical Miles, of Solidity; to the va&s;tly greater Quantities in the Sun of 763.000 Miles Diameter; 1,813.200,000.000, &s;quare Miles of Surface; and 230.000,000.000,000.000 cubical Miles of Solidity. Numbers that are &s;till more immen&s;ely beyond all Human Imagination; and &s;uch as, if <HI>Epicurus</HI> or <HI>Lucretius</HI> were alive, who could rai&s;e their &s;tupid Conceptions no farther than the large|ne&s;s of a Cart-wheel for the Sun it &s;elf, would have quite affrighted them out of their fooli&s;h Philo&s;ophy. We here learn the <HI>Annual Velo|cities</HI> of the &s;everal Planets, Primary and Se|condary; and of the Comets, from the &s;lowe&s;t Motion in the Moon, of 2200 Miles, to the
<PB N="248" REF="289">
&s;wifte&s;t in <HI>Mercury</HI>, of 100.000 Miles, in the &s;pace of one Hour. As al&s;o we here learn the <HI>Diurnal Velocities</HI> at the Equator, the &s;lowe&s;t of the Moon of 10 Miles, the &s;wifte&s;t of <HI>Jupiter</HI> of 25.000 Miles in the &s;ame &s;pace of one hour: And that even we upon the Surface of this Earth, when we cro&s;s the Line, with all our Buildings, move along 1030 Miles in an Hour; and that by Con&s;equence, in this Latitude, I my &s;elf, while I &s;eem to be at re&s;t, writing this Treati&s;e in my Study, do yet, together with my Study, and my Books, revolve at the rate of above 600 Miles in the &s;ame time. Nay, we here get a &s;tep farther, and, without going down into the Central Regions of any one of the Cele&s;tial Bodies, do certainly pronounce, not only concerning the Mathematical <HI>Quantity</HI> of Bulk or <HI>Magnitude</HI>, but in many Ca&s;es con|cerning the real Phy&s;ical <HI>Quantity of Matter</HI> con|tain'd in tho&s;e Bodies, as compar'd, I mean, with one another; which is as far as Philo&s;o|phy can po&s;&s;ibly carry us. Whereby we find that the Moon, which is the lea&s;t of all tho&s;e Bodies who&s;e Quantities of Matter we know, is not quite the 9,000.000th part &s;o great in this re&s;pect as the Sun; and that the Quantity of Matter of all the Planets and Comets taken to|gether, does not in probability amount to the 500th part of that in the Sun alone; the <HI>Sun</HI>, I &s;ay, that mo&s;t amazing and mo&s;t prodigious Creature of God that is in this Sy&s;tem, and perhaps in all the vi&s;ible Sy&s;tems about us! of which Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> bravely &s;ings;
<Q><L><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t.</HI> Lib. v.</NOTE>Thou Sun, of this great World, both Eye and Soul,</L>
<L>Acknowledge God thy Greater: Sound his Prai&s;e</L>
<L>In thy Eternal Cour&s;e!</L></Q>
<PB N="249" REF="290">
Moreover, we here certainly di&s;cover by Con&s;e|quence, the very inward Texture of the &s;ame Cele&s;tial Bodies, who&s;e Quantities of Matter were above determin'd; and, without digging into the Bowels of any of the Planets, do, with equal Certainty, pronounce what comparative degree of <HI>Den&s;ity</HI> they have: Whereby we learn that the Sun is va&s;tly too den&s;e for a Flame, as <HI>Cartes</HI> determined; and that the Moon is the Den&s;e&s;t, and <HI>Saturn</HI> the Rare&s;t of all the&s;e Bo|dies; and that the former is above eight times as den&s;e as the latter. Which Conclu&s;ions &s;hew the admirable Nature, and profound Reach of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Philo&s;ophy, which, with equal ea&s;e and certainty, penetrates to &s;uch deep Truths, as no other Hypothe&s;es do &s;o much as in the lea&s;t hope or pretend to attain to, even by Conjecture. Nor do we &s;top here; but placing our &s;elves on the &s;everal <HI>Surfaces</HI> of the fore-mentioned Planets, we by certain Rea|&s;oning determine the comparative <HI>Weight</HI> of any given Body on tho&s;e &s;everal Surfaces; and ob|&s;erve, with great Satisfaction, that the &s;ame Strength that can here lift One Hundred Pound would not be able on the Sun's Surface to lift Four Pounds; and that what on the Moon's Surface, where this Weight is the lea&s;t, would weigh one pound; would, if transferr'd to the Sun's Surface, where it is the greate&s;t, weigh above 71 of the &s;ame Pounds. We do al&s;o here Contemplate tho&s;e <HI>Diurnal Motions</HI> with re&s;pect to the other Heavenly Bodies, which we are forced to gather by Geometrical Rea&s;oning, with re&s;pect to our own Earth; and which the &s;everal Inhabitants of tho&s;e Bodies, (if &s;uch there are, and if they be provided with
<PB N="250" REF="291">
&s;uch Means of &s;eeing our Earth, as our Te|le&s;copes have of late afforded us for &s;eeing them) may al&s;o Contemplate with their Eyes. Whereby we find that they do revolve in Peri|ods &s;ufficiently unequal; from the &s;lowe&s;t, that of the Moon, in 27 Days, to the &s;wifte&s;t, that of <HI>Jupiter</HI>, in a little le&s;s than 10 Hours: which Sight &s;eems to me to be a kind of &s;en&s;ible Confirmation of the like Diurnal Motion of our Earth.</P>
<P>We are here al&s;o taught to e&s;timate the dif|ferent <HI>Degrees of Heat and Light</HI>, which our Fellow Creatures derive from the great Foun|tain of both, the Sun, when nearer, and when farther off than we are: Which difference is &s;o va&s;tly great, even at the mean Di&s;tances of the &s;everal Bodies from the Sun, that <HI>Mercury</HI>, the neare&s;t, has in a Mean no le&s;s than 120000 times the Quantity of Light and Heat which the utmo&s;t Comet has; and that the Heat at the Sun's Surface is no le&s;s than 45000 times as great as any part of this Earth receives from it, at any time; and that withal the outmo&s;t of our known Comets abides at one time an Heat more than 400,000.000 of times, as great as it does another. An <HI>amazing difference</HI> this! and &s;uch as is no where el&s;e to be parallel'd, that we know of, in the whole Sy&s;tem of Na|ture. We here al&s;o &s;ee, how &s;oon our Earth, and any of the Planets would <HI>fall to the Sun</HI>, or to their central Bodies, if their Projectile Velocities &s;hould cea&s;e; from the innermo&s;t of the Circumjovials, which would fall to <HI>Jupiter</HI> in 7 Hours; to the outmo&s;t Comet which would not fall from its middle di&s;tance to the Sun under 66 Years. We have al&s;o taken a
<PB N="251" REF="292">
view of our neighbouring Body the Moon, and found it in almo&s;t all re&s;pects &s;uch a Planet, or Place of Habitation, as our own Planet the Earth is. And we &s;hould be greatly wanting to our Selves, and to the <HI>Decorum</HI> of Things, as well as highly injurious to our great Creator, if we &s;hould &s;o much as &s;cruple the Suppo&s;ition of &s;o noble an Habitation's being Inhabited; of &s;o noble a Colony's being Peopled. Tho&s;e who can attentively view the Wonderful, and Beautiful, and Admirably contriv'd Structure of this our adjoining Planet with its Sea and Land, Moun|tains and Valleys, Day and Night, Summer and Winter; together with its Clouds and Atmo|&s;phere, and Moon; all in corre&s;pondence to our Earth, which is every where full of intelli|gent Beings its Inhabitants; and yet &s;hall pee|vi&s;hly deny that it either now is, or ever was, or is to be in like manner inhabited by &s;uch In|telligent Beings; and are re&s;olv'd it &s;hall have no other U&s;e than to enlighten our Earth, and be peep'd at through our Tele&s;copes; &s;eem to me too Unphilo&s;ophical to be argued with; and only worthy to be left to their own narrow Genius, which can neither think a brave uncommon Thought, nor admit any thing but what their Education or Sy&s;tem have already forc'd upon them. Nor indeed, do we need to debate here with &s;uch Men; becau&s;e it can hardly be imagined they will ever have Skill or Curio&s;ity enough to peru&s;e, what either has al|ready been written, or may hereafter be written upon &s;uch great and noble Subjects. Be&s;ides this &s;ingle Attendant of ours, we have taken a Pro&s;pect of Four &s;uch Attendants on <HI>Jupiter</HI>, and Five on <HI>Saturn</HI>, with the remarkable <HI>B$lts</HI>,
<PB N="252" REF="293">
and Diurnal Revolution of the former; and the much more a&s;toni&s;hing <HI>Ring</HI> of the latter: The One bearing a near re&s;emblance to our Clouds under the Torrid Zone, upon our Earth's daily Motion, and &s;o hinting to us the Likene&s;s there is between that and our Planet: And the Other affording an In&s;tance of a more &s;urprizing Variety in the Works of God and Nature than is any where el&s;e to be &s;o evidently di&s;cover'd in the World. Nor mu&s;t I here pa&s;s over in Silence that wonderful, that prodigious, that amazing In&s;tance of <HI>Swiftne&s;s of Motion</HI>, which the Rays of Light afford us, and which is ga|thered from the Eclip&s;es of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Planets; no le&s;s I mean than that of 180.000. Miles in one Second of Time; whence it appears, that a Being, might vi&s;it all the Men in the World, if he proceeded with the Swiftne&s;s of the&s;e Rays, and tho&s;e Men were placed in any tolerable Order along or near a great Cir|cle of the Earth, in a very few Seconds of time. Nor do any of the other &s;wifte&s;t Motions that we know of in the Univer&s;e de&s;erve to be called <HI>&s;wift</HI> in compari&s;on of this before us; which is no other than a con&s;tant In&s;tance of the Power of God in moving the Bodies which he has made, with what Velocity he plea&s;es; and thereby of communicating his Influences, even in a Mechanical Way, to immen&s;e Di&s;tances, almo&s;t in a Moment. But then, be&s;ides this Planetary World, which was in &s;ome mea&s;ure known to the Ancient A&s;tronomers, we have al&s;o taken a View of another World, or Species of Bodies, known indeed by Name, but hardly at all by Nature to the Ancients; I mean the Sy|&s;tem of Comets, which till lately were gene|rally
<PB N="253" REF="294" MS="Y">
look'd on as incon&s;iderable and fortuitous Meteors of our Air only; but do now appear to be more numerous, and not le&s;s con&s;iderable than the Planets them&s;elves. The&s;e Comets pa&s;s &s;o entirely through the Planetary Regions, and may &s;o certainly approach to the Planets them|&s;elves both in their De&s;cent and A&s;cent; that they may &s;erve hitherto unknown Ends of Pro|vidence, both in their own Con&s;titution, and by the Changes they may occa&s;ion in the Planets; and do therefore well de&s;erve our mo&s;t attentive Con&s;ideration. Nor certainly were the Planets, their Number, Magnitude, Motions, and U&s;es &s;o well known in &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Years after their fir&s;t Ob&s;ervation, as the Comets now are in a few Hundreds, or rather Decads of Years &s;ince they were to any good Purpo&s;e ob&s;erved by A&s;tronomers. And then, la&s;tly, after all, we have taken a &s;hort imperfect View of the va&s;tly nu|merous, the va&s;tly great, and va&s;tly di&s;tant Sy|&s;tems of the Fixed Stars, or to us new Sy&s;tems of Worlds quite remote from this our Planetary and Cometary World: In Compari&s;on of all which Sy&s;tems of Worlds, our own entire Sy&s;tem, with its Sun, and all its Planets and Comets, mu&s;t be but incon&s;iderable; probably not the 10.000^t^h, perhaps not the 100.000^t^h, or 1,000.000^t^h Part of the Whole: And who&s;e Di&s;tance appears to be &s;o great from us, that a Musket Bullet that &s;hould go 240 Feet in one Second of Time, if it had been &s;hot up at the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation to the neare&s;t fixed Star, and continued its Cour&s;e even|ly all the Way, would hardly have arrived there by this time, after the long Interval of 6200 Years. So immen&s;ly numerous, and immen&s;ly great and glorious is the entire Sy&s;tem; and &s;o incon&s;ide|rable

Upon the View of which he was overheard to &s;ay, <HI>What a Dog am I, thus to bla&s;pheme Him that made me and all this beautiful World</HI>! I do not at pre&s;ent recollect from whom I had this Account; tho' the Thing it &s;elf was too remarkable to be for|gotten. But whether any Mi&s;take might be made in the Circum&s;tances of this Story or not, 'tis unque&s;tionable that &s;uch mu&s;t frequently be the natural Reflections of a con&s;idering Mind, in the&s;e Circum&s;tances; who&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions no|thing can entirely &s;uper&s;ede. As for my &s;elf, I mu&s;t freely own, that as I had from my Child|hood ever learned from the Works of God to acknowledge and wor&s;hip Him that made them; and as I improv'd in Anatomy, in A&s;tronomy, in Natural Philo&s;ophy, I &s;aw that this fir&s;t Im|pre&s;&s;ion or Voice of Nature was &s;till more and more confirm'd and e&s;tabli&s;hed by farther En|quiries; &s;o that when, in my younger Days, I had with great Difficulty and Pains, attained to the Knowledge of the true Sy&s;tem of the World, and of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s wonderful Di&s;coveries thereto relating, I was not only fully <HI>convinc'd</HI>, but <HI>deeply and &s;urprizingly affected</HI> with the Con&s;equences of this Nature; I was &s;atisfy'd that they were evident <HI>Demon&s;trations of Natu|ral</HI>, and noble <HI>Atte&s;tations to Revealed Religion</HI>.

and certain have tho&s;e Principles appeared; and the more &s;ure and certain have tho&s;e Con&s;equen|ces &s;eem'd; tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd that the Deepne&s;s of the Surprize and Impre&s;&s;ion, as in all the like Ca&s;es, can never be &s;o &s;en&s;ible and affecting, as it was upon the fir&s;t Knowledge of &s;uch amazing Truths, and momentous Corolla|ries from them. And I cannot but heartily wi&s;h, for the common Good of all the <HI>Scepticks</HI> and Unbelievers of this Age, that I could imprint in their Minds all that real Evidence for Natu|ral and for Reveal'd Religion that now is, or during my pa&s;t Enquiries has been upon my own Mind thereto relating: And that their Temper of Mind were &s;uch as that this Evi|dence might afford them as great Satisfaction as it has my &s;elf. For then I am &s;ure they would not wonder at my warm and zealous Endea|vours, even at the Hazard of all I have in this World, for the Re&s;toration of true Religion, for the re&s;cuing the Wicked out of their dangerous State, and for the bringing as many as po&s;&s;ible to that future Happine&s;s; which is the grand De&s;ign of Religion, and the ultimate Felicity of Mankind. But tho' this entire Communication of the Evidence that is, or has been in my own Mind, for the Certainty of Natural Religion, and of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and Chri&s;tian In&s;titutions, be in its own Nature impo&s;&s;ible; yet I hope I may have leave here to addre&s;s my &s;elf to all, e&s;pecially to the <HI>Scepticks</HI> and Unbelievers of our Age; to do what I am able for them in this momentous Concern; and to lay before them, as briefly and &s;eriou&s;ly as I can, a con&s;iderable Number of tho&s;e Arguments which have the greate&s;t Weight with me, as to the harde&s;t Part
<PB N="259" REF="300">
of what is here de&s;ired and expected from them; I mean the Belief of Reveal'd Religion, or of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and Chri&s;tian In&s;titutions, as con|tain'd in the Books of the Old and New Te&s;ta|ment; or in all the Genuine Records now ex|tant of both Religions. I have already ob&s;erv'd that the <HI>Scepticks</HI> and Unbelievers of the be&s;t Sen&s;e do now confe&s;s, that the Arguments for a God, his Attributes, and Providence, are very &s;trong; but they will by no Means allow, that tho&s;e for Divine Revelation, and for the Bible are &s;o: Tho' indeed very few of them, I &s;peak it upon certain Experience, have &s;tudyed tho&s;e Sacred Books with any Degree of that Imparti|ality, Seriou&s;ne&s;s, Application, Sagacity or Piety, which is but requi&s;ite for forming any tolerable Judgment about them. But to wave farther Preliminaries, &s;ome of the principal Rea&s;ons which make me believe the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations to be true, are the&s;e following.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Reveal'd Religion of the <HI>Jews</HI> and Chri&s;tians lays the Law of Nature for its Foun|dation; and all along &s;upports and a&s;&s;i&s;ts Natu|ral Religion; as every true Revelation ought to do.</P>
<P N="2">II. A&s;tronomy, and the re&s;t of our certain Mathematick Sciences, do confirm the Accounts of Scripture; &s;o far as they are concern'd.</P>
<P N="3">III. The anciente&s;t and be&s;t Hi&s;torical Ac|counts now known, do, generally &s;peaking, con|firm the Accounts of Scripture; &s;o far as they are concern'd.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The more Learning has increas'd, the more certain in general do the Scripture Ac|counts appear, and its difficult Places are more clear'd thereby.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="260" REF="301">V. There are, or have been generally &s;tand|ing Memorials pre&s;erv'd of the certain Truths of the principal Hi&s;torical Facts, which were con&s;tant Evidences for the Certainty of them.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Neither the Mo&s;aical Law, nor the Chri&s;tian Religion, could po&s;&s;ibly have been receiv'd and e&s;tabli&s;hed without &s;uch Miracles as the Sacred Hi&s;tory contains.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Altho' the <HI>Jews</HI> all along Hated and Per&s;ecuted the Prophets of God; yet were they forced to believe they were true Prophets, and their Writings of Divine In&s;piration.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The Ancient and Pre&s;ent State of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation are &s;trong Arguments for the Truth of their Law, and of the Scripture Pro|phecies relating to them.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The Ancient and Pre&s;ent State of the Chri&s;tian Church are al&s;o &s;trong Arguments for the Truth of the Go&s;pel, and of the Scripture Prophecies relating thereto.</P>
<P N="10">X. The Miracles whereon the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion are founded, were of old owned to be true by their very Enemies.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The Sacred Writers, who liv'd in Times and Places &s;o remote from one another, do yet all carry on One and the &s;ame grand De&s;ign, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Salvation of Mankind, by the Wor&s;hip of, and Obedience to the One true God, in and through the King <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>: which without a Divine Conduct could never have been done.</P>
<P N="12">XII. The principal Doctrines of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion are agreeable to the an|ciente&s;t Traditions of all other Nations.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The Difficulties relating to this Reli|gion are not &s;uch as affect the Truth of the Facts,
<PB N="261" REF="302">
but the Conduct of Providence; the Rea&s;ons of which the Sacred Writers never pretended fully to know, or to reveal to Mankind.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Natural Religion, which is yet &s;o cer|tain in it &s;elf, is not without &s;uch Difficulties as to the Conduct of Providence, as are obje|cted to Revelation.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The Sacred Hi&s;tory has the greate&s;t Marks of Truth, Hone&s;ty, and Impartiality of all other Hi&s;tories what&s;oever; and withal has none of the known Marks of Knavery and Im|po&s;ture.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The Predictions of Scripture have been &s;till fulfilled in the &s;everal Ages of the World whereto they belong.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. No oppo&s;ite Sy&s;tems of the Univer&s;e, or Schemes of Divine Revelation, have any tolerable Pretences to be true, but tho&s;e of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the plain and obvious Arguments which per&s;uade me of the Truth of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations: which I &s;hall briefly in&s;i&s;t on here, and earne&s;tly recommend them to the farther Con&s;ideration of the inqui&s;itive Reader: Hoping that He will fir&s;t endeavour to attain that Serious, Upright, Impartial, Ho|ne&s;t, and Obedient Temper of Mind, that a Creature ought to have when he is enquiring into the Laws and Will of his Creator; and will join with me in putting up to that great Creator, &s;ome &s;uch humble Addre&s;s as this fol|lowing, for the good Succe&s;s of his Enquiries.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;O God of my Fathers, and Lord of Mercy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wi&s;d. ix.1.4.5.10.</NOTE> who ha&s;t made all things with thy Word: Give me Wi&s;dom that &s;itteth by thy Throne; and reject me not from among thy Children. For

<P N="1">(I.) The fir&s;t Rea&s;on, why I believe the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations to be true, is this; That they lay the Law of Nature for their Foundati|on; and all along &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;t Natural Re|ligion, as every true Revelation ought to do.</P>
<P>That all Divine Revelation &s;uppo&s;es the Be|ing and Attributes of God, which are di&s;cove|rable by the Light of Nature; and particularly the Perfections of Unity, Ju&s;tice, Veracity, Ho|line&s;s, and Goodne&s;s, all con&s;idering Men will readily grant: And that no pretended Revela|tion, which clearly and evidently contradicts the Laws of Nature, founded on tho&s;e Divine Perfections, can be more than pretended, they will as readily grant al&s;o. So that I &s;hall not need to prove that Part of my Propo&s;ition. But then, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations do, for the main at lea&s;t, mo&s;t plainly and clearly agree with, and &s;upport tho&s;e Natural Notions we have of God and of Religion, and is founded upon them, is every where &s;uppo&s;ed and affirm'd in all the Original Records of tho&s;e Religions. And if the Ceremonial Burden&s;ome Laws once given the <HI>Jews</HI>, be objected again&s;t, as unworthy of God, and oppo&s;ite to his Wi&s;|dom and Goodne&s;s, I &s;hall take leave to &s;ay, that this is objected without any ju&s;t Foundation, and contrary to the be&s;t and mo&s;t authentick Accounts we have of the Rea&s;on of tho&s;e Laws;

I mean, that they were given on purpo&s;e for the Support of Natural Religion; and that this ap|pears not only by occa&s;ional Pa&s;&s;ages in the Sa|cred and Acknowledged Books of the Old and New Te&s;tament, but by an entire particular and noble Di&s;cour&s;e, which we have upon this whole Subject in the <HI>Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions</HI>, and which without all di&s;pute is of much greater Authority than the uncertain Gue&s;&s;es of the Moderns.<NOTE PLACE="marg">St. <HI>Cle|ment</HI> and <HI>Iren.</HI> Vind. of the Con|&s;titut.

<P N="2">(II.) The next Rea&s;on why I believe the Truth of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and Chri&s;tian Revelations, is this; That A&s;tronomy, and the re&s;t of our certain Mathematick Sciences, do confirm the Accounts of Scripture; &s;o far as they are con|cern'd.</P>
<P>'Tis certain that in many Points we can examine the A&s;&s;ertions of Ancient Authors, whether they &s;ay true or not, by &s;ome Parts of the Mathematicks; and particularly in &s;uch Ca&s;es as the Enquiries of our Age enable us to examine Things more nicely than the Authors of Old Accounts could imagine: And again&s;t which Methods of Examination they could therefore by no means provide; any other ways, I mean, than by giving us the Ancient Facts as they really happen'd. In which Ca&s;es the Di&s;covery of the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the Proportions of Things, and the Agreement of the Old Narrations with Mathematical Computations, will be a very great Argument for the Vera|city of the Writers; as will the Ab&s;urdity of &s;uch Proportions, and the Di&s;agreement of Things, be a like great Argument for their Carele&s;ne&s;s or Fal&s;ity. Now this Rea&s;oning being obvions; let us try &s;ome of the Sacred Narrations by it; and &s;ee on which Side this <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> will incline us, and that in &s;ome of its mo&s;t remarkable In&s;tances. Thus we have al|ready &s;een that the Age of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part vii. &sect;. 3. prius.</NOTE> as taken from the Sacred Records, perfectly agrees with the be&s;t Methods which Chronology and

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New Theo|ry, <HI>p. 144,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>Thus it hes been el&s;ewhere demon&s;trated, that the mo&s;t Ancient Year of the World, even before, as well as after the Deluge, had ju&s;t Twelve Months,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vii.11. <HI>with v.</HI>24. <HI>and</HI> viii.4.</NOTE> of Thirty Days apiece, or Three Hundred and Sixty Days in the whole; as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Account of the Deluge does mo&s;t na|turally imply.</P>

But becau&s;e tho&s;e Examples have been there already produc'd by me, I &s;hall &s;ay no more of them here; and rather alledge a remarkable one, which has not been there mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="310" MS="Y">It is well known, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> a&s;&s;ures us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vi.vii.viii.</NOTE> how at the general Deluge, all Land Animals that e&s;cap'd the &s;ame, were &s;aved by an Ark; that this Ark held Sevens of Clean, and Pairs of Unclean Bea&s;ts; with their Food for the full Space of a Year; and that from thence therefore all &s;uch Creatures are now derived throughout the Earth. He al&s;o gives us the Dimen&s;ions of this Ark, 300 Cubits long; 50 Cubits broad; and 30 Cubits high. Yet does it no way appear that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>, or any of his Contemporaries, could then examine the Num|ber of all &s;uch Animals, or the quantity of Food nece&s;&s;ary for them, during &s;o long an Inter|val, as the Modern Mathematicians and Natu|rali&s;ts have done. Here therefore we have one of the faire&s;t and mo&s;t exact Methods of trying the Verity of this Part of the Sacred Hi&s;tory that could well be de&s;ired: And this Method has accordingly been put in Practice in this very Ca&s;e, by Two Eminent Mathema|ticians and Naturali&s;ts, <HI>Buteo</HI>, and Bi&s;hop <HI>Wilkins</HI>; and it has thence appeared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Pool</HI>'s Synop&s;is, and Bi&s;hop <HI>Wilkins</HI>.</NOTE> that if we Mea&s;ure all by a common Cubit of 18 Inches, the Ark will fully contain all tho&s;e Creatures, with their Food for a Year; and that in &s;eparate and convenient Cells and Apartments; though in a &s;omewhat &s;trait and difficult Manner. It has al&s;o &s;ince appeared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scripture Weights and Mea|&s;ures.</NOTE> by Bi&s;hop <HI>Cumberland</HI>'s more exact &s;tating of the Old Cubit, that it was not &s;o &s;hort as 18, but in Reality near 22 Inches long; and by Con&s;equence, as that Learned Prelate judi|ciou&s;ly ob&s;erves, that an Ark built by that Cubit, being almo&s;t double to one built by this other, will not only in a &s;trait Manner,
<PB N="270" REF="311">
but with great Ea&s;e and Freedom, contain all that we have above-mentioned; though this it will do &s;till, without abundance of wa&s;te Room, which would have &s;erved to no u&s;e|ful Purpo&s;es. So that the Re&s;ult of this Com|putation is plainly this; That the Dimen&s;ions of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Ark, as &s;et down in the Sacred Hi&s;tory, are fully atte&s;ted to by Geometry and Natural Hi&s;tory; and that tho&s;e Dimen|&s;iods are as well proportion'd to the End for which they were de&s;ign'd, as any Mathema|tician or Architect could now chu&s;e for the like Purpo&s;es: Which Exactne&s;s, &s;ince none in the Days of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> could naturally attain to, 'tis mo&s;t rea&s;onab&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e it true Fact, and to a&s;cribe the Direction of the whole, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> does, to the mo&s;t perfect <HI>Geometrician</HI>, who acts always <HI>in Number, Weight, and Mea&s;ure</HI>, the Great Creator and Provider for Mankind, and all Creatures what&s;o|ever.</P>
<P N="3">(III.) Another Rea&s;on why I believe the Truth of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations, is this; That the other Anciente&s;t and be&s;t Hi&s;torical Accounts now known, do, generally &s;peaking, confirm the Accounts of Scripture, &s;o far as they are concern'd. That this is a mo&s;t na|tural and &s;ure way of di&s;covering the Vera|city of any pretended Ancient Hi&s;tories in one Country, to compare them with the other Ancient and Approved Records of the Neigh|bouring Nations, which had Concerns with them; or with any other Ancient Records that are of good E&s;teem relating to the &s;ame Times, and the &s;ame Affairs, is without Controver&s;y among all Men. Accordingly, when we are
<PB N="271" REF="312">
examining the Veracity of the Sacred Writers of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation, by whom almo&s;t all the Books of Scripture were written, it can|not but be highly nece&s;&s;ary to proceed by the &s;ame Method. Nor are our Unbelievers un|appriz'd of the Fitne&s;s of this Procedure, when they appear &s;o ready to alledge even the mo&s;t poorly atte&s;ted Antiquities of &s;ome other Nations, to oppo&s;e them to the&s;e well at|te&s;ted Antiquities of the <HI>Jews</HI>: Which Pro|cedure &s;hews at once their Acknowledgment of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of this way of Enquiry; and yet the Weakne&s;s of their Cau&s;e upon &s;uch an Examination. For, give me leave to &s;ay, that if all the &s;maller Fragments, of even any tolerable Credit or Antiquity, which can be found in all the old Books, of which we have any Accounts, and may &s;eem con&s;iderably to contradict the Sacred Records, were gathered together, and were compar'd with tho&s;e mo&s;t Ancient, Authentick, and Numerous Books and Fragments, which evidently &s;upport them, tho&s;e I mean, collected by <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> again&s;t <HI>Apion</HI>; by <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> in his Evangelical Prepara|tion and Demon&s;tration; by <HI>Huetius</HI> in his Evangelical Demon&s;tration; by <HI>Grotius</HI> in his Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion; by <HI>Bochart</HI> in his <HI>Phaleg.</HI> and <HI>Hierozoican;</HI> by Bi&s;hop <HI>Stil|lingfleet</HI> in his <HI>Origines Sacrae;</HI> and by many others who have written on that Noble Sub|ject, the Difference of the Evidence would appear va&s;tly great and &s;urprizing. In&s;omuch that one of the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters of all that Ancient Learning, <HI>Grotius</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deveritar Relig. Chri&s;t. iii.14.</NOTE> does directly pro|fe&s;s, that if we do not reckon &s;ome open Enemies to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religions,
<PB N="272" REF="313">
who lived too late to know Things them&s;elves, and were too partial to be believ'd without other Authority, there are not any Genuine Records, or Te&s;timonies of Antiquity extant, that contradict the Scriptures. Which Thing being &s;o, it is mo&s;t highly rea&s;onable for us to have a great Veneration for tho&s;e Sacred Re|cords, which, however different from Modern Hi&s;tories, as they ought to be, are yet &s;o very agreeable to, and &s;o fully confirm'd by the other olde&s;t and mo&s;t faithful Remains of the Ancient Ages of the World.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Another Rea&s;on why I believe the Truth of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations is this; that the more Learning has increa&s;ed, the more certain in general do the Scripture Accounts appear, and its difficult Places have been more clear'd thereby. If Hypothe&s;es, or Accounts of Things in any Kind, e&s;pecially when they are &s;trange and &s;urprizing, be advanc'd or believ'd by any, and then put into the Method of Ex|amination before the World, when it is im|proving in Knowledge, and New certain Di&s;|coveries are frequently made in all Parts of Learning; it is ju&s;tly to be expected, that what is really true and well-grounded will &s;tand the Te&s;t, and what is not &s;o, will &s;ink under it: The one will thereupon be approv'd and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; and the other rejected and di&s;carded. Thus it happens frequently in Human Opini|ons; and by this means the Improvement of the Learning of the&s;e Two la&s;t Centu|ries has done va&s;t Service to Truth, by di|&s;tingui&s;hing what is Solid and Genuine; from what is Trifling and Spurious. Thus
<PB N="273" REF="314">
we now generally know which Writings pre|tending to Antiquity, or to belong to Ancient Authors of Reputation, are Genuine, and which are Suppo&s;ititious; which till the late Revival of Critical Learning, were &s;trangely confounded together. Thus the late Improvements in A&s;tro|nomy, particularly by Tele&s;copes, and the won|derful Di&s;coveries of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>, have determin'd the Di&s;pute between the <HI>Ptole|maick</HI>, the <HI>Tychonick</HI>, and the <HI>Copernican</HI> Sy&s;tems of the Heavens, in Favour of the la&s;t; which till lately was Matter of great Di&s;|pute, even among the A&s;tronomers them&s;elves. And a great Number of other Examples might ea&s;ily be alleg'd to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. Let us then apply this Method of Trial, and &s;ee whether the Ancient Polite Learning of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> of Old; or the much greater and &s;olider Learning of the Two la&s;t Centuries; the former of which grew up &s;omewhat after the Times of the Old Te&s;ta|ment, and the latter long after the Time of the New, has confirm'd or contradicted tho&s;e Sacred Books of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>; that we may the better judge of their Solidity and Authority. Now in this Enquiry, what <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI> has produc'd for the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Religion, in his Books again&s;t <HI>Apion</HI>, already quoted, may &s;erve as a Specimen of the va&s;t Advantage the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> In&s;pired Writings received from the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Learning; of which he was a great Ma&s;ter. And what <HI>Grotius</HI> has produc'd for both the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, and the clearing their Difficulties in his <HI>Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion</HI>, and Comments on
<PB N="274" REF="315" MS="Y">
the Scripture, may be a Sample of the great Confirmation they all receive from the Revival of Ancient Learning in the la&s;t Ages; of which he was no le&s;s a Ma&s;ter. Nor, as I hope, will what has been above produc'd from the Modern A&s;tronomy, Mathematicks, and Phi|lo&s;ophy, for the Support of the &s;ame In&s;pired Writings, be unfit to be e&s;teemed a farther Spe|cimen in general to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. But that I may not &s;eem wholly to content my &s;elf with what has been already ob&s;erved by my &s;elf or others, under this Head, I &s;hall produce a new Specimen or Two for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e. 'Tis well known what a Noi&s;e the Scepticks and Unbelievers make with the Un|certainty of very Old Accounts, and very Old Books; the great Omi&s;&s;ions, Additions or In|terpolations that may ea&s;ily have happen'd in them, during a Cour&s;e of many Ages; and the con&s;equent Uncertainty of the Books of the New, but e&s;pecially of tho&s;e of the Old Te&s;ta|ment; and &s;o, mo&s;t of all, of the olde&s;t Parts of it, &s;uch as the Five Books of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>. Now in this Ca&s;e the Revival of Learning, and of Languages, and the Inqui&s;itivene&s;s of this la&s;t Age, has procur'd us a mo&s;t Noble Trea&s;ure, as an Atte&s;tation in this Matter, where it was lea&s;t expected: And from the &s;mall Remainders of the Old <HI>Samaritans</HI>, &s;till left about <HI>Sichem</HI> in <HI>Judea</HI>, we have lately recover'd the <HI>Penta|teuch</HI> it &s;elf: Not as in later Ages, known and owned by the Body of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation, or Two Tribes, &s;pread over the World; but as peculiarly receiv'd and allowed by all the Twelve Tribes, before the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Captivity;
<PB N="275" REF="316" MS="Y">
as written in the Original Character u&s;ed be|fore that Captivity, by that whole Nation; and as continued down to, and received by the Remains of tho&s;e Ten Tribes in <HI>Samaria</HI>, all the Times of their bitter Hatred to the other <HI>Jews</HI>, even to this very Day. So that this mu&s;t needs be a Copy entirely di&s;tinct from the common <HI>Ma&s;&s;orete</HI> one now current, and in all Probability much older than tho&s;e from whence even the <HI>Septuagint</HI> made their Tran&s;lation, long before the Times of our Saviour. Yet upon the Compari&s;on of this <HI>Samaritan Penta|teuch</HI>, with the common <HI>Hebrew</HI>, and with the <HI>Septuagint</HI>; abating the Diver&s;ity of &s;ome Chronological Numbers in them all, as to the Lives of the Patriarchs, before and after the Flood, of &s;mall Importance here, there appears but very little Difference between them; and none at all that I know of in any Points of Con|&s;equence, either in Hi&s;tory, Doctrine or Practice&punc; So that for the main, it exceedingly &s;trengthens the Authority of our pre&s;ent Copies of the <HI>Pentaleuch</HI>; and by Parity of Rea&s;on, of the pre&s;ent Copies in good mea&s;ure of all the Books of the Old Te&s;tament, which do with us other|wi&s;e &s;tand upon the &s;ame Foot, and are u&s;ually of a much lower Antiquity than the&s;e Five Books of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. v. <HI>and</HI> xi.</NOTE> Tis al&s;o well known that the Scriptures affirm, what &s;eems to us very &s;ur|prizing, and next to impo&s;&s;ible, <HI>viz.</HI> that in the early Times of the World, Men commonly liv'd to many Hundred Years of Age; and that in particular before the Deluge, they liv'd frequently to near a Thou&s;and; that after the Deluge, their Lives declin'd gradually from
<PB N="276" REF="317" MS="Y">
Five or Six Hundred, to about Seventy or Eighty Years only; although from the Days of <HI>David</HI>, till this Time, that Age of Man has been at a Stand, and about that &s;malle&s;t Duration. This Account mu&s;t be own'd to be bold and &s;trange to us, after near 3000 Years Experience of the la&s;t and &s;horte&s;t Period of Human Life. But then, when we reflect that the Learning of <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI> produc'd many &s;trong Ancient Atte&s;tations to this Account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiq. I.4.</NOTE> which were then Extant; that the pre&s;ent <HI>Chine&s;e Annals</HI>, lately di&s;co|ver'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chronol.</HI> p. 60 &mdash; 65</NOTE> exactly agree, &s;o far as they are con|cern'd; as I have el&s;ewhere &s;hewn; and that the pre&s;ent Numbers of Mankind upon the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">p. 65 &mdash; 68.</NOTE> taken together with the u&s;ual Period of Years for their Increa&s;e and Doubling; and with the Number of Years that by the be&s;t Evi|dence the Earth has been in its pre&s;ent State; do plainly require &s;uch longer Duration of Mens Lives, in tho&s;e Ancient Ages: Which la&s;t ways of Trial are entirely owing to the new Improvements in Learning: We &s;hall &s;ee Rea&s;on at once to believe the Truth of the Fact, how &s;trange &s;oever it may now appear; and to pay a due Deference to tho&s;e Original Sacred Records, whence we were fir&s;t and be&s;t inform'd of it. It cannot al&s;o but appear very &s;trange at fir&s;t Sight in the Old Te&s;tament, that <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> e&s;pecially, &s;hould in &s;o peculiar a Manner po&s;&s;e&s;s and make U&s;e of a much greater Quantity of Silver and Gold than we have any like Examples of even in this Age; when yet by our Modern Navigation, the <HI>Indian</HI> Mines have yielded us &s;uch new Trea&s;ures of that Kind; and that yet after|ward
<PB N="277" REF="318" MS="Y">
the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation &s;hould lo&s;e tho&s;e mighty Riches. Yet will all this appear very agreeable to Truth, if we con&s;ult Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI>'s late Admirable Book, <HI>Of the Conjouning the Hi&s;tory of the Old and New Te&s;tament</HI>, where in the very Beginning of it, he has trac'd the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Navigation, and &s;uch its Effects, with the greate&s;t Sagacity, and to the greate&s;t Sati&s;|faction.</P>
<P>I might al&s;o in&s;tance in the Improvements in Sacred Chronology, by the Di&s;covery of the Canon of <HI>Ptolemy</HI>; in the full Solutions of the Deluge long &s;ince pa&s;t, and of the Conflagration yet to come; with many other Things of a like Nature, which the Modern Improvements and Di&s;coveries have a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in; all &s;till in exact Agreement with the Scriptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament: But becau&s;e I have already hinted at the&s;e Matters under former Heads, and have el&s;ewhere more fully in&s;i&s;ted on them to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, I &s;hall no farther enlarge on them in this Place.</P>
<P N="5">(V.)

<P N="6">(VI.)

For, to &s;ay nothing here of the <HI>Gentiles</HI>, if we Con&s;ider but the Ob&s;tinacy and Perver&s;ene&s;s of the People of the <HI>Jews</HI> in all Ages, and that &s;till they did, to the utmo&s;t Times we can trace them in general, and as a Nation, mo&s;t firmly believe, and openly &s;ubmit, and mo&s;t tenaciou&s;ly adhere to the Doctrines, Di&s;cipline, Laws and Government delivered by <HI>Mo&s;os</HI>; how &s;trange, unea&s;y, or burden&s;ome &s;oever, &s;everal of the Particulars were; and did yet in great Numbers, on the Preaching of the Go&s;pel, renounce many of tho&s;e their for|mer Opinions and Con&s;titutions, of which otherwi&s;e they were &s;o exceeding tenacious; and entirely receiv'd, believ'd and obey'd the Chri&s;tian Revelation, on its fir&s;t Appearance in the World; and this in Oppo&s;ition to their former Prejudices, their certain Intere&s;ts, their Reputation, and De&s;ire of Self-pre&s;ervation; nay at a Time when they knew they mu&s;t frequently lo&s;e, and &s;uffer, and die for this new Religion; and all this without any other Hopes than what belong'd to another World; and mu&s;t be en|tirely fru&s;trated, if that Religion proved fal&s;e: Con&s;idering all this, I &s;ay, it is, morally &s;peak|ing,

impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch Numbers, of <HI>Jews</HI> e&s;pecially, &s;hould &s;ubmit &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to both the&s;e Religions, as they certainly did, without convincing and undoubted Miracles for their Confirmation.</P>
<P N="7">(VII.) I believe the Truth of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Reve|lation, becau&s;e I perceive that that Nation, which all along Hated and Per&s;ecuted the Me&s;&s;engers and Prophets of God when they were alive, were yet forced to believe all along that they were true Me&s;&s;engers and Prophets of God, and their Writings of Divine In&s;piration. This is to me a very remarkable Ob&s;ervation, a very Certain one, and of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence in this Enquiry. That the <HI>Jews</HI> were anciently a Stubborn, Di&s;obedient, and Stiff-necked People, and not without the mo&s;t forcible Methods to be reduc'd to the Ob&s;ervance of the Divine Laws, is evident in their whole Hi&s;tory; that they all along, in particular, oppo&s;ed <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>, and Re|jected, and even Per&s;ecuted and Slew, the &s;uc|ceeding Prophets, when they were &s;ent unto them to call them to Repentance and Amend|ment, is alike evident therein: That yet they were forced to own, that the&s;e Men were the true Prophets of God, is equally plain therein; and is demon&s;trable from their con&s;tant Recep|tion afterwards of tho&s;e Writings wherein the&s;e Things appear, as Divinely In&s;pir'd, to this very Day. It is al&s;o clear in tho&s;e very Writings &s;till extant, that their Contents are &s;o cutting and &s;evere, without the lea&s;t Tincture of Flat|tery, or &s;paring them in their Vices, that no|thing but a full Conviction of the Certainty of their Divine Mi&s;&s;ion and Authority, could ever
<PB N="282" REF="323">
induce them to a Reception of them. The Ca&s;e in general of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Legi&s;lator and Prophets, was all along much the &s;ame with that of good <HI>Micaiah</HI>, in the Days of <HI>Ahab</HI>; concerning whom when <HI>Jeho&s;ophat</HI> enquired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Kings xxii.7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>Is there not a Prophet of the Lord that we may enquire of him?</HI> Wicked <HI>Ahab</HI> reply'd, <HI>There is One Man</HI>, Mi|caiah, <HI>the Son of</HI> Imlah, <HI>but I hate him; for he doth not prophe&s;y Good concerning me, but Evil</HI>. Yet all this Hatred notwith&s;tanding, <HI>Micaiah</HI>'s Denunciation of God's Judgments upon <HI>Ahab</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 19-38.</NOTE> followed with its immediate and dreadful Com|pletion, &s;oon convinc'd them all, that he was a true Prophet of God: And He is accordingly ever &s;ince allow'd to have been &s;uch by that whole Nation. And this has been equally true of the re&s;t of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Prophets all along. which &s;eems to me a &s;trong Argument for their Veraci|ty and Authority, as &s;till ab&s;olutely undeniable among that Nation.</P>
<P N="8">(VIII.)

The Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did, in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t affecting manner, deliver &s;uch obliging Promi|&s;es to that Nation, upon their keeping clo&s;e to the Wor&s;hip of the True God, and to the Obe|dience of the Laws then delivered to them; with &s;uch terrible Threatnings upon their Reje|ction of them, upon their Idolatry and Di&s;obe|dience; and the &s;ucceeding Hi&s;tory and State of that Nation all along, does &s;o clearly and parti|cularly inform us of the Completion of tho&s;e Promi&s;es and Threatnings to this very Day, as

But becau&s;e I have el&s;ewhere in&s;i&s;ted on it, in my <HI>Boyle</HI>'s <HI>Lectures</HI>, and in my <HI>Chronology of the Old Te|&s;tament</HI>, I &s;hall not here enlarge, but refer the in|qui&s;itive Reader thither for his farther Satisfa|ction. Only I may be allow'd here to put the Unbelievers in mind, how peculiar and unpa|rallel'd the State of this People has ever been. That at fir&s;t they were &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the World; that they lived in it afterward like a &s;eparate Species of Creatures; that after all their Mi&s;eries and Captivities, they have &s;till pre&s;erved them&s;elves a &s;eparate People, and &s;till recovered their ancient Land and Settlement again in a wonderful manner, till this their la&s;t grand Captivity and Di&s;per&s;ion; and that the Body of the two Tribes, and &s;ome Remains of the Ten at lea&s;t, are even now, to the Surprize of all con&s;idering Men, after &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Years a &s;eparate Body, unmixt with other Nations, among which they &s;ojourn; as at once a &s;tand|ing Monument of the Truth of their original

<P N="11">(XI) I believe the Chri&s;tian Religion to be true, becau&s;e the Ancient Adver&s;aries of Chri|&s;tianity acknowledged the Miracles whereon the Chri&s;tian Religion is founded. to be True. I here in&s;i&s;t only on the Confe&s;&s;ion of Adver&s;aries as to the Truth of the Facts on which the <HI>Chri|&s;tian Religion</HI> depends: Not that I doubt of the like Confe&s;&s;ion as to the Miracles wrought by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Prophets, for the Confirma|tion of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Religion, where-ever their Ad|ver&s;aries had means of knowing the &s;ame. But becau&s;e we have but a few Records, or rather Fragments of Records, now extant from the Heathen Writers, contemporary with tho&s;e of the Old Te&s;tament; and of them &s;till fewer that relate di&s;tinctly to the anciente&s;t and principal <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Miracles, I chu&s;e to confine this Ob&s;erva|tion to the Chri&s;tian Miracles.

<P N="12">(XII) I do therefore believe the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations to be true, becau&s;e the Sa|cred Writers, who liv'd in Times and Places &s;o remote from one another, do yet all carry on One and the Same Grand De&s;ign, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Salvation of Mankind, by the Wor&s;hip of, and Obedience to, the One true God, in and through the King <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>; which without a Divine Conduct and In&s;piration, reaching through tho&s;e Ages and Places, could never have been done. This Ob&s;ervation is very remarkable as to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Writings, if they be compar'd
<PB N="287" REF="328">
with the &s;everal Books of the <HI>Greek</HI> Philo&s;o|phers; the former of which never di&s;pute or debate what their main Scope was to be, or what they were to have ever in View, as ever naturally tending to one known De&s;ign be|forementioned; while the latter were &s;o far from any common Principles of that Nature, that the very De&s;ign they were to aim at, or the <HI>Summum Bonum</HI> it &s;elf, the &s;upreme Happine&s;s of Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ap. Au|gu&s;t. De Civitat. Dei. L.xix 1.</NOTE> was a Matter of wonderful Debate among them. Nay, <HI>Varro</HI>, one of their mo&s;t famous Authors, is &s;aid to have reckon'd up no fewer than 288 po&s;&s;ible Opinions about it. And 'tis very plain, that the due Wor&s;hip and bli&s;s|ful Enjoyment of the One True God, and that by the Means of the King <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>; or indeed any other &s;uch Noble and Divine Means of at|taining them, are almo&s;t wholly Strangers to the Heathen Philo&s;ophers. And no wonder, when they were &s;o far from knowing the Nature and Will of the One True God, with the true Wor|&s;hip and Obedience due to him, which yet were knowable to Inqui&s;itive Hone&s;t Minds by the Light of Nature; or from owning the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Mediator, or of Divine Revelation; that they did not generally acknowledge the One True God him&s;elf; much le&s;s did they make the Wor&s;hip of, and Obedience to him, the Foundation of their Doctrine; as all &s;ound Philo&s;ophy, as well as Divinity, ought certainly to have done. Accordingly, tho' they all agreed in the Excellency of Virtue in general, which God has too deeply &s;tamp'd upon Human Souls, and made too evidently nece&s;&s;ary in general to Human Happine&s;s, even in this World, to per|mit
<PB N="288" REF="329">
it to be overlook'd by any thinking Men; yet did they agree in almo&s;t nothing el&s;e. And in|deed, their &s;everal Philo&s;ophical <HI>Dogmata</HI>, &s;eem like our Modern School-Divinity, to have been rather creditable Kinds of Amu&s;ements, and Sub|jects for the Exerci&s;e of Wit and Parts in Di|&s;putation, than directed to the real In&s;truction and Improvement of Mankind in true Religion, or in the Attainment of Happine&s;s, either in this or in another World; which is the main View of the Holy Scriptures. And accordingly the Variety of Opinions, and the Frequency of Di&s;putes among tho&s;e Philo&s;ophers, did but nou|ri&s;h this di&s;putacious Humour of the &s;everal Parties; and this without any Pro&s;pect of the real Di&s;covery of Truth, or of reducing Men to a regular and religious Way of Life, in order to their future Happine&s;s; which for cer|tain ought to be the grand Intention of all our Philo&s;ophical and Religious Enquiries. Let but any one compare the unanimous Agreement of all the Sacred Writers, from <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to <HI>Polycarp</HI>, in the main Scheme of Divine Revelation, and Conduct of Human Life; with the almo&s;t entire Di&s;agreement and Uncertainty there is as to &s;uch important Matters among the Heathen Philo&s;o|phers; &s;o far I mean as tho&s;e Matters are known to be deriv'd from Revelation; and he will &s;oon &s;ee a va&s;t Difference between them; and will not be able to account for it, without allowing the former to be of Supernatural and <HI>Divine</HI>, and the latter of bare <HI>Human Original</HI>.</P>

anciente&s;t Traditions of all other Nations. For tho', as I have ju&s;t been ob&s;erving, the Heathen Philo&s;ophers among the <HI>Greeks</HI>, who were com|paratively later, and more modern, and who fol|lowed their own Rea&s;onings in all &s;uch Matters, were mighty uncertain, and various in their Philo&s;ophical and Religious Notions; as all Men are when they have no better guidance than Hu|man Suppo&s;al and Conjecture; Yet was it quite otherwi&s;e with the more ancient Ages, and tho&s;e Natural and Divine Doctrines which they re|ceived by Tradition from their fir&s;t Founders, and which mo&s;t probably were originally deriv'd from the fir&s;t Parents of Mankind, or at lea&s;t from the earlie&s;t of their Progenitors after the Deluge.

at the &s;ame &s;trange Conduct of Provi|dence, and hardly able to extricate him&s;elf from the Difficulties therein; even with all the Ad|vantages of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Religion, and the more con&s;tant Happine&s;s of the Good, and Afflictions of the Bad under it, than in any other Nations of the World. Thus al&s;o we find the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. xii.i. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> one whom God frequently made u&s;e of in his Revelations to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation, and who endured the &s;evere&s;t Impri&s;onment for his Faithfulne&s;s to his Duty as a Prophet; was equally &s;hock'd and &s;urpriz'd at the &s;ame &s;eem|ingly unequal and partial Conduct of Provi|dence; and complains to God of it; yet with|out any full or &s;atisfactory An&s;wer: And the like Ob&s;ervations may be made as to <HI>Solomon</HI>, and others of the In&s;pired Writers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle&s;. pa&s;&s;im. <HI>See</HI> 4 <HI>E&s;d.</HI> pa&s;|&s;im.</NOTE> While yet, the&s;e their Difficulties and Complaints, never in the lea&s;t made them doubt or di&s;pute about the Cer|tainty of their Mi&s;&s;ion and In&s;piration; about the Truth of the Promi&s;es and Threatnings they denounced from God; or about the Reality of the Miracles that were performed in his Name. Accordingly I ob&s;erve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recogn. pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE> that <HI>Simon Magus</HI>, with his old Followers among the Hereticks, who al|lowed the Truth of the Facts and Miracles of the Go&s;pel, did only make u&s;e of &s;uch Rea&s;ons as were taken from the &s;eeming Inju&s;tice, and Unaccountablene&s;s of &s;everal Parts of Provi|dence, in order to &s;ubvert Chri&s;tianity. Nor is the Ca&s;e much different among our pre&s;ent Un|believers; who being not able to find any good Grounds to overthrow the Truth and Certainty of the Prophetick and Miraculous Atte&s;tations, which the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> allege for the
<PB N="293" REF="334">
Divinity of their Religion, do commonly pro|ceed after the &s;ame manner, and mu&s;ter up all the Arguments they are able from the like In|&s;tances of Providence, or Pa&s;&s;ages in Scripture which &s;eem to them ab&s;urd and unrea&s;onable. Now what is the natural Re&s;ult of all this? But that, as the Scriptures every where allow and &s;uppo&s;e, God's proper Time for unravelling the My&s;teries of his Providence, <HI>the Day for the Revelation of his righteous Judgment</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. ii.5.</NOTE> is not yet come; that he has yet, during all this Inter|val, afforded &s;ufficient Demon&s;trations of the Certainty of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revela|tion's Derivation from him notwith&s;tanding; which is the proper State of this Matter, and ought to be the proper Mea&s;ures of our own Faith and Practice accordingly. For as the Difficulties are there and only there, where Di|vine Revelation does not pretend they are yet cleared; &s;o is there no certain Difficulties, &s;o far as the &s;ame Revelation pretends to Evidence and Demon&s;tration, for what it recommends to us; which Ca&s;e methinks highly de&s;erves the Con|&s;ideration of our Modern Scepticks and Un|believers.</P>
<P N="14">(X$V.) Natural Religion, which is yet &s;o cer|tain in its &s;elf, is not without &s;uch Difficulties, as to the Conduct of Providence, as are object|ed to Revelation; and therefore none that be|lieve the former, ought to be deterr'd by &s;uch Difficulties from believing the latter. This is al&s;o a &s;omewhat uncommon, but certainly not an improper Ob&s;ervation, as to the Credibility of Divine Revelation, to all tho&s;e I mean who are not entirely Athei&s;ts, or again&s;t all Divine Providence. Thus we find in the Conduct of
<PB N="294" REF="335">
Natural Providence &s;ome &s;uch &s;trange <HI>Phenome|na</HI> as are not ea&s;ily accountable, or reconcileable to the mo&s;t becoming Notions we all have of the One, Wi&s;e, Ju&s;t, and Beneficent Creator and Governor of the Univer&s;e. We find &s;uch Anti|pathies of even one brute Creature again&s;t ano|ther; &s;uch a va&s;t Number of tho&s;e Creatures de&s;troy'd immediately upon their Birth; &s;uch &s;udden and untimely Deaths that frequently happen to many others of them in the Cour&s;e of Things; &s;uch a va&s;t Number of them de|voured by other brute Creatures, by Men, nay, &s;ometimes by tho&s;e of their own Species: We find in the State of Mankind, even ab&s;tracted from Re|velation, &s;o many Mi&s;eries and Calamities every where in the World, involving the &s;everal Indi|viduals from their Birth to their Grave, and tho&s;e often no way to be avoided or cured by any Me|thods of Prudence, or Virtue, or Religion it &s;elf, as affords great Difficulties to thinking Per|&s;ons, and have occa&s;ion'd abundance of Hypo|the&s;es, in order to their Reconciliation with a general Providence: And after all, are in great Mea&s;ure equally difficult to us, as they have been to the pa&s;t Ages of the World. If there|fore, the&s;e great Objections notwith&s;tanding, the Arguments for Natural Providence do &s;till appear cogent and undeniable, as indeed they now do more than ever; and all wi&s;e Men ra|ther chu&s;e to believe what they have full Exter|nal Evidence for in Natural Religion, although they cannot yet &s;olve all the Difficulties therein why do not we proceed after the &s;ame Fair and Impartial Manner in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Revelation? And equally believe tho&s;e Scriptures, for which we have &s;uch &s;trong and cogent Arguments,
<PB N="295" REF="336">
although we cannot yet &s;olve all the Difficulties contained in them? E&s;pecially when I may venture to &s;ay, the Ca&s;e of Divine Revelation, compar'd with Natural Religion, is, as to this Point, not at all to the Di&s;advantage of the former; and that the Objections again&s;t Na|tural, are not at all Inferior to tho&s;e again&s;t Re|veal'd Religion: As any Impartial Man will ea&s;ily confe&s;s upon the Compari&s;on.</P>
<P N="16">(XVI) I therefore believe the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> Revelations to be true, becau&s;e the Re|cords of the &s;ame, or the Books of the Old and New Te&s;tament, have the greate&s;t Marks of Hone&s;ty and Impartiality of all others; and withal, have none of tho&s;e known Marks of Knavery and Impo&s;ture, which all fal&s;e and &s;purious Writings mu&s;t certainly have. The&s;e Ob&s;ervations &s;eem to me highly u&s;eful, and very certain and obvious, upon a careful Peru&s;al, and exact Compari&s;on: But becau&s;e they are common, and frequently in&s;i&s;ted on by others, and if enlarg'd upon, would take up too great a Room here, I &s;hall chu&s;e to refer the Reader to tho&s;e who have already treated of tho&s;e Subjects; particularly to our excellent Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI>, in his Appendix to the Life of the Impo&s;tor <HI>Mahomet</HI>.</P>
<P>Only I beg of the Inqui&s;itive Reader him|&s;elf to reflect on this Head, as he reads the Sa|cred Hi&s;tories, and to con&s;ider with him&s;elf how very improbable it is that tho&s;e Sacred Accounts, which of all other Ancient Writings now Extant, have evidently the greate&s;t internal Marks of Sincerity, and the lea&s;t imaginable Signs of Fal&s;hood of all others, &s;hould yet be the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Forgeries, and mo&s;t notorious Im|po&s;tures in the whole World: As upon the Sup|po&s;ition
<PB N="296" REF="337" MS="Y">
of their being untrue, they mu&s;t mo&s;t certainly appear to be to all Mankind.</P>
<P N="16">(XVI.) I believe the Truth of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations, becau&s;e the Scripture Pre|dictions have been &s;till fulfilled in the &s;everal Ages of the World whereto they belong. This is an eminent and open Method of trying the Truth, or Fal&s;hood, of any pretended Revela|tion, which is &s;o explicit as to foretel future Events; e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are very remote, and depend mainly on the free Actions of Men, or on the Coun&s;els of God, and the State of the Invi&s;ible World; &s;uch as the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations mo&s;t certainly are. And to this Completion do I venture openly to ap|peal, for the Ju&s;tification of tho&s;e In&s;titutions. Accordingly, I dare venture to affirm, with St. <HI>Peter</HI>, that this Character of a <HI>more &s;ure Word of Prophecy</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. i.16.</NOTE> is one of the &s;tronge&s;t Ar|guments for the Truth of the Scriptures, of all other what&s;oever. I have already &s;hew'd el&s;e|where, how exactly the Sacred Predictions that belong to Times already pa&s;t, and were extant in the Days of <HI>David</HI>; as al&s;o not a few of tho&s;e belonging to Chri&s;tianity afterward, have been exactly fulfilled in their appointed Times, in my <HI>Sermons at Mr.</HI> Boyle's <HI>Lectures</HI>, in my <HI>Chro|nology and Harmony</HI>, in my <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Revelation of St.</HI> John, and lately in my <HI>Literal Accompli&s;hment of Scripture Prophecies</HI>. And I declare I am &s;o far from &s;eeing any Rea&s;on from the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of Affairs in the World, to doubt of the Completion of tho&s;e which remain, even for the main, as I have expounded them, that I rather find great Cau&s;e to believe, that the Prophetick Scheme begins to clear up apace, and that the
<PB N="297" REF="338" MS="Y">
<HI>Kingdoms of this World</HI>, as is there Predicted, will in no long Time (and this probably, as moved in Part by the Plainne&s;s of the Com|pletion of &s;ome of the Sacred Predictions ju&s;t now pa&s;t, or &s;oon coming on) <HI>become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apoc. xi.15.</NOTE> <HI>and that he &s;hall Reign for ever and ever</HI>. But this important Matter has been &s;o particularly treated of by me el&s;ewhere, in the Treati&s;es already referr'd to, that it is by no means proper to enlarge upon it here any farther; Only,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xxiv.15.xi.15.</NOTE> <HI>Who&s;o Readeth, let him under&s;tand. He that hath Ears to Hear, let him Hear.</HI></P>
<P N="17">(XVII.) I am therefore obliged to admit the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations to be true, and Divine; becau&s;e no oppo&s;ite Sy&s;tem of the Uni|ver&s;e, or Scheme of Divine Revelation, has any tolerable Pretences to be true, or can be compar'd, as to Evidence, with tho&s;e of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI>. Whither would our Athei&s;ts or Dei&s;ts have us go for Information or Satisfaction, in our mo&s;t concerning Enquiries about the State of the Univer&s;e, and of Religion, and of our Souls hereafter, if we mu&s;t di&s;card the Holy Scriptures? Mu&s;t we go to any other Records, as better atte&s;ted to? This I believe they will not &s;ay. Mu&s;t we have Recour&s;e to the ex|ploded and ab&s;urd Schemes of the Eternity of the World, and the Fatality of all Things; or to that greater Ab&s;urdity of the Formation and Di&s;&s;olution of the Univer&s;e by the For|tuitous Concour&s;e of Atoms? This al&s;o, I be|lieve they will now not much in&s;i&s;t upon. Mu&s;t we then rely on Natural Religion, and the Voice of common Rea&s;on for our Guidance to Happine&s;s? This Rule, &s;o far as it can go,
<PB N="298" REF="339">
is entirely allow'd and improv'd by the Scri|ptures, and does it &s;elf naturally lead us farther to Divine Revelation, as the only Security of not erring in many Ca&s;es, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Divine Wor&s;hip, and Propitiation; and the principal Means of di&s;covering the Certainty of &s;uch future Rewards and Puni&s;hments, as are in many Ca&s;es ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the Ob&s;ervance of the Laws of Nature. Mu&s;t we, I &s;ay, take our Leaves of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations, which have &s;uch Mighty Atte&s;tations as coming from God, and tru&s;t our &s;elves wholly to our own Human, Frail, and Uncertain Imaginations, Inclinations, and Con|jectures in Divine Matters? This &s;eems very hard, and very unrea&s;onable. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that the Philo&s;ophy and Religion we now are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, have &s;everal difficult Places, and &s;ome hitherto unaccountable Phaenomena in them: Yet for certain may we ju&s;tly expect to have a better Philo&s;ophy and Religion to be|take our &s;elves to, before we leave the&s;e; I mean better atte&s;ted, and freer from Perplexities and Incumbrances, both in Faith and Practice; otherwi&s;e we &s;hall act ab&s;urdly; and imitate the Folly of him who pulls down his pre&s;ent Hou&s;e, on Account of &s;ome apparent Inconveniencies therein, without either the Skill or the Ability to build a better in its Stead. And for my &s;elf, I venture to promi&s;e all the Scepticks and Unbelievers of our Age, that as &s;oon as ever they will &s;hew me a Scheme of Philo&s;ophy and Religion more Rational, and better Atte&s;ted to than that of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>, which is the Per|fection of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> al&s;o, I will be their Pro&s;elyte: But till then they mu&s;t excu&s;e me.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="340">The&s;e, Reader, are &s;ome of the Arguments and Motives which induce me really to believe, and con&s;cienciou&s;ly to endeavour to live up to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> In&s;titution, and to ad|mit the Holy Scriptures for Divinely In&s;pired: And I heartily wi&s;h they may have the &s;ame Influence upon every Reader; that &s;o they may <HI>with the Heart believe unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. x.10.</NOTE> <HI>and with the Mouth make Confe&s;&s;ion unto Salvation</HI>. One Thing I will add here; that &s;ince we cannot act upon Motives and Arguments any farther than we can know them; nor can we go upon Evidence any farther than it is extant in the World for our Examination; and &s;ince the Ju&s;tice of God can only require us to act upon the Motives and Evidence his Providence affords us, and can only call us to an Account for our Behaviour in Agreement with &s;uch Motives and Evidence; I venture to &s;ay, with great A&s;&s;urance, that whatever be the Truth of the Things them&s;elves, which we can no otherwi&s;e determine about, the Argu|ments and Evidence now Extant in the World do for the main, &s;o greatly and undoubtedly <HI>preponderate</HI> on the Side of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Revelations, that we are bound by all the Rules of Ju&s;tice, and Rea&s;on, and good Sen&s;e, to prefer it, to be determin'd by it, and act upon it; and that therefore tho&s;e who do otherwi&s;e may ju&s;tly be call'd to Account, and puni&s;h'd for the contrary Procedure, for their Infidelity and Di&s;obedience; &s;eeing the&s;e are cho&s;en in Defiance of plainly greater, and plainly <HI>&s;uperior.

<L>Let the High Cedar, and the Mountain Pine</L>
<L>Lowly to Thee, Great King, their Heads incline.</L>
<L>Let ev'ry Spicy Odoriferous Tree</L>
<L>Pre&s;ent its Incen&s;e, and its Balm to Thee.</L>

<L>And Thou, Heav'n's Viceroy o'er this World below,</L>
<L>In this ble&s;t Task Superior Ardor &s;how:</L>
<L>To view thy Self inflect thy Rea&s;on's Ray.</L>
<L>Tran&s;ported, Nature's Theatre &s;urvey.</L>
<L>Then all on Fire the Author's Skill adore,</L>
<L>And in loud Songs extol Creating Pow'r.</L>
</LG>

<L>Degenerate Minds in mazy Error lo&s;t</L>
<L>May combat Heav'n, and impious Triumphs boa&s;t;</L>
<L>But while my Veins feel animating Fires,</L>
<L>And vital Air my breathing Brea&s;t in&s;pires,</L>
<L>Grateful to Heav'n I'll &s;tretch a pious Wing,</L>
<L>And Sing His Prai&s;e, who gave me Pow'r to Sing.
