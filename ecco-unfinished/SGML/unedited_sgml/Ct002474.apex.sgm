<SPEAKER>Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>I declared I would tell my uncle of her, and from that time I have never &s;poken to her.&mdash;In re&s;entment for this (as &s;he pretends) I have been made a pri&s;oner; but I fear &s;he has &s;ome other wicked view; for ever &s;ince, <HI>Sharply,</HI> her brother, that audacious fellow, dares to per&s;ecute me with his impudent addre&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>Sharply! A bold man, or I'm mi&s;taken. There's another of Sir John's favourites;&mdash;but it's no bu&s;ine&s;s of mine; I never meddle in other peoples affairs; but to be &s;ure it was an unchri&s;tian thing, and a barbarous thing, and a very uncon&s;cionable thing, in Sir John:&mdash;But Sir John has no con&s;cience, that's what I blame him for.</P>

<P><HI>I</HI> put you in a flurry! Lord, child, for what? If I had been abrupt indeed, and &s;aid any particular per&s;on was come, you might &s;ay &s;o;&mdash;but &s;o far from that, I intend to make you gue&s;s half-a dozen times perhaps before I tell you.</P>

<P>WELL, but child, now that the Captain is convinced that his &s;u&s;picions were fooli&s;h, and groundle&s;s, and idle, and ridiculous, and every thing; you ought to forgive him, and make up your quarrel.</P>

<P>No, Madam, what I have declared, was but in ju&s;tice to my own character; for the re&s;t, I am little &s;olicitous to &s;atisfy a man, capable fir&s;t of &s;u&s;pecting, and then of accu&s;ing me, as he has done.</P>

<P>You'll live in a cottage on love&mdash;determined like a true Arcadian &s;wain; but it won't do in this part of the world, let me tell you, boy.
