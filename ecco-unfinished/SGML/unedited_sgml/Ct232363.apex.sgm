<HEAD>MEMOIRS Of the LIFE and DEATH of Sir John Dineley Goodere, Bart.</HEAD>
<P>_AS the inhuman murder of &s;ir J. Dineley, my unfortunate uncle, has made &s;o great a noi&s;e as to excite the public attention, &s;ome per&s;ons have made their advan|tage of this circum&s;tance, in or|der to palm upon the world a fal&s;e account of the matter. We mu&s;t not wonder that the horrid fact I am about to treat of, as well as capt. Goodere's conduct and lady Dineley's character, have been greatly mi&s;repre&s;ented: which makes it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et tho&s;e particu|lars in a clear light, in order to do ju&s;tice to the memory of the decea&s;ed and to the cha|racters of the living. Capt. Goodere was ac|counted a man of honour 'till he murdered his brother; and &s;ir J. Dineley, a plain ho|ne&s;t gentleman, was reckoned a very &s;ad fel|low, lived almo&s;t univer&s;ally hated, and died unlamented.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only relate &s;uch matters of fact as came within the verge of my own knowledge.</P>
<P>Sir John Dineley's grandfather and grand|mother, by his mother's &s;ide, where &s;ir Edw. Dineley, of Charlton, Worce&s;ter&s;hire, and
<PB N="4" REF="5">
Frances, a &s;i&s;ter to the earl of Rockingham. His father, &s;ir Edw. Goodere of Burghope, Hereford&s;hire, married mi&s;s Dineley, their only daughter, by whom that e&s;tate came into the Goodere family. Sir Edw. Dineley, by will, had &s;ettled his e&s;tate upon his daugh|ter's elde&s;t &s;on. Sir J. Dineley, at that time, was a younger &s;on, and had no great pro&s;pect in point of fortune, his father having a great many children. As &s;ir Edw. Dineley had the care of all the young gentlemen's educa|tion, he was determined not to adhere to that fal&s;e principle which had &s;o much prevailed among&s;t the Engli&s;h gentry, of rather letting their younger children &s;tarve, than derogate from the dignity of their family by putting any of them to trade; wherefore this young gentleman was placed very rarly in the mer|chant's &s;ea &s;ervice; and, after he had &s;erved the u&s;ual time, had the command of a &s;hip given him. At this juncture unfortunately for him as it afterwards proved, his elder bro|ther was killed in a duel in Ireland. Upon this &s;ir John was &s;ent for to Charlton. With much reluctance he left the &s;ervice; but he obeyed the will of his grandfather, and en|tered upon a way of $ife quite new and &s;ingu|lar to him. Sir Edw. Dineley &s;oon after died. Lady Goodere was the only per&s;on between &s;ir John and the e&s;tate, and &s;he did not &s;ur|vive her father many years. Sir John &s;uc|ceeded to the e&s;tate, without an education &s;uitable to &s;uch a rank; for, with all due de|ference to the gentlemen of the navy, a &s;hip was not at that time thought a proper academy
<PB N="5" REF="6">
for politene&s;s, nor the art of navigation a nece&s;&s;ary ingredient towards compo&s;ing a &s;o|cial character. Under the&s;e di&s;advantages &s;ir John came to his e&s;tate: but opened this part of his life with an action which gave &s;ufficient proof of the natural goodne&s;s of his heart. Sir E. Goodere, upon his lady's death, found him&s;elf fal$en, from very flouri&s;hing circum|&s;tances, to a narrow income: Sir John, who knew his father's temper, was aware how an affair of this kind would affect &s;ir Edward's Io&s;ty &s;pirit, and voluntarily con&s;ented to the enlargement of his father's fortune, by con|tracting his own. Henley hall, on the banks of the Severn, Worce&s;ter&s;hire, about 500 l. a year, was de&s;ired by &s;ir Edward, and devi&s;ed by-&s;ir John to his father's u&s;e for life.</P>
<P>But I will relate an affair which was much exaggerated to &s;ir John's di&s;advantage, and which, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, it is not in my power fully to vindicate.&mdash;The funeral of &s;ir Edw. Goodere drew a general odium on &s;ir J. Dineley. The very great obligation that &s;ir John had laid on his father, made it natu|ral for the &s;on to expect that &s;$r Edward would make &s;ome returns for this favour at his death; but con$ulting his will, &s;ir John found him|&s;elf only tenant for life, &s;ubject to an im|peachment of wa&s;te. Sir Edward had like|wi&s;e often a&s;&s;ured him, that what he left would be free and unincumbered; but, upon exa|mination, &s;ir Edward's debts amounted to above 500 l. and both his real and per&s;onal e&s;tates bound for the payment of them. This
<PB N="6" REF="7">
u&s;age &s;ir John re&s;ented not a little; and not being philo&s;opher enough to ma&s;ter his pa&s;&s;ions, he, in the heat of blood, hurried away his father, and buried him in a preci|pitate and &s;lighting manner.</P>
<P>Some time a&s;ter his mother's death, he m$rried, with the con&s;ent of all parties, an agreeable young lady, who was the only daughter of Mr. Law&s;ord, of Stapleton, near Bri&s;tol. She brought &s;ir John a large real and per&s;onal e&s;tate; and for &s;ome time they were as happy a couple as ever entered into the conjugal &s;tate; 'till at length, &s;ome little jar|ring happening between them, &s;everal per|&s;ons, as it is too common on &s;uch occa&s;ions, worked up &s;ir John to a very great unea&s;ine&s;s. Lady Dineley's conduct was her protection, by which &s;he triumphed over the malice of tho&s;e who chiefly were in&s;trumental in cau&s;ing a variance between &s;ir John and her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I will now enter upon that part of &s;ir John's life which gave ri&s;e to tho&s;e broils and con|tentions that quite di&s;&s;olved all the bonds of friend&s;hip and brotherly love between the Captain and him.&mdash;S$muel Goodere, e&s;&abque; was another &s;on of &s;ir Edw. Goodere, and was likewi&s;e by his grandfather placed very early in the King's &s;ervice, on board a man of war; and, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, behaved bravely. He was at the taking of St. Seba&s;tian, Ferrol and St. Antonio; at which latter place he burnt three men of war, the magazines, and &s;tores. Before he went to &s;ea he was placed at Henley &s;chool by his grandfather, from whence, with &s;ome companions, he made an
<PB N="7" REF="8">
excur&s;ion to Charlton, robbed &s;ir Edward Dineley's hou&s;e, and clapped a pi&s;tol to his mother's brea&s;t, who&s;e great indulgence to all her children was her only fault. Another in&s;tance is contained in a letter from Captain Goodere to his father: it was a demand for money, in order to &s;upply &s;ome extravagant expences; and he acquainted him, if he would not comply with his reque&s;t, it was his fixed re&s;olution to wait on him in the country, and &s;end a brace of bullets thro' his heart.&mdash;Th$s, in his early days, he had learned to contemn all laws, both divine and human.</P>
<P>We &s;hall next con&s;ider the Captain's con|duct as a brother.&mdash;Capt. Goodere had been in the &s;ervice upwards of 20 years, and never attained to any higher po&s;t than a lieutenan|cy of a man of war. This &s;urprized every body, bec$u&s;e &s;ir Edw. Goodere h$d it once in his power to obtain almo&s;t any favo$r from the gentlemen in the admini&s;tation. Whether the &s;on's unhappy conduct had alienated $$e father's affections, or whether &s;ir Edward's &s;pirit would not permit him to &s;olicit a $avo$r for his own family, I cannot dete$m$ne; $$t capt. Goodere, 'till the year 1733, was but a lieutenant. The occa&s;ion of his pre&s;e$$nt at la&s;t you will find as follows:&mdash;Ch$$lton, the &s;eat of the Dineley $amily, is &s;$tuate near the corporate town of Eve&s;ham; $or which rea&s;on, that family have always had a gre$t influence upon the con&s;t$$uents of that $o|rough. Sir Edw. Goodere repre&s;ented them in two or three parliaments. At the general election there were three candidates for that
<PB N="8" REF="9">
corporation. One of them imagined if he could reconcile &s;ir Edward and his two &s;ons to his intere&s;t he &s;hould be &s;ure of carrying his point: upon this he immediately applied to the Captain, and told him, if he would do him that kind office, he &s;hould &s;oon be made commander of a &s;hip. Capt. Goodere &s;wallowed the bait, and brought his father and brother to comply with the gentleman's reque&s;t. Not long after capt. Goodere found that this great promi&s;er had it not in his power to be as good as his word. This baulk, with a promi&s;e of the like nature from another of the candidates, induced the captain to turn &s;ides. He likewi&s;e de&s;ired his father and bro|ther to follow his example; but they rejected his reque&s;ts, and, with a becoming &s;corn, a&s;&s;ured him, they would never &s;werve from the intere&s;t they had once e&s;pou&s;ed. But this declaration had no other effect upon the Captain, than to make him a more obedient tool to his MASTER.</P>
<P>The two brothers &s;tood candidates for the office of mayor the &s;ame year, and were both elected. This admini&s;tered fre&s;h cau&s;e of contention; but an action of the captain that followed this, was quite unp$rdonable. The two Wor&s;hipfuls the &s;unday after the election, went, attended by the proper officers, to church. Sir John came fir&s;t, and accordingly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Mayor's &s;eat. The Captain came in after the &s;ervice was begun, and &s;eeing his brother in the chair, ordered his &s;ervants to dethrone Mr. Mayor; which orders were execu$ed; &s;ir John was removed,
<PB N="9" REF="10">
and the Captain &s;olemnly in&s;talled. This revolution di&s;gu&s;ted &s;ir John not a little; but he had prudence enough to &s;tifle his re&s;ent|ment; and, con&s;idering that it was neither a proper time nor place for wrangling, &s;at very contentedly in an humbler place, From this time an open declaration of war was made on both &s;ides: whoever was a friend, or even a companion, to one, was looked on by the other as his mo&s;t inveterate enemy. Sir Ed. Goodere declared him&s;elf on his elde&s;t &s;on's &s;ide, and refu&s;ed to &s;ee his &s;on Samuel for many years; but my mother, mrs. Foote, a daughter of &s;ir Edw. Goodere, at la&s;t healed it up between the captain and his father.</P>
<P>After this difference was compo&s;ed, the Captain concealed the rancour of his mind, and made profe&s;&s;ions of the great love he bore his brother, and how greatly the number of law &s;uits &s;ir John was engaged in afflicted him, and how readily he would contribute all his a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards extricating him out of the&s;e difficulties: but when &s;ir Edward died, it was plain the Captain hated his brother as much as ever, but thought an open declaration of it, in his father's life time, might prejudice the views and expectations he had from him. The moment &s;ir Edward expired, he plucked off the ma&s;k and appeared in his natural co|lours. Sir John, upon the news of his father's illne&s;s, immediately &s;et out for Burghope, and found, upon his arri$al there, no hopes of &s;ir Edward's recovery: he therefore di&s;|patched a me&s;&s;enger, to acquaint his brother with the affair, and de&s;ire his company: agree|able
<PB N="10" REF="11">
to this me&s;&s;age the Captain came to Burghope; not as an afflicted &s;on. who came to pay his la&s;t &s;ad offices to his father's me|mory, but as an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in and robber: for the moment &s;ir Edward expired, the Captain at|tacked his brother, and told him to depart the hou&s;e, for both that and the e$$ate were his, by virtue of a lea&s;e granted to him be|fore his father's death. Upon this &s;ir John &s;hewed him &s;ir Edw. Goodere's will, which gave the Hereford&s;hire e&s;tate to &s;ir John for his life, and after him to capt. Goodere and his heirs male <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, a$d &s;ir John Dineley's threatening to di&s;inherit Capt, Goodere, in favour of his &s;i&s;ter's &s;on, John Foote, of Tru$o, in Cornwall, e&s;&abque; (brother to the late Samuel Foote, e&s;&abque;) has been generally thought to have been the cau&s;e of &s;ir John's murder.&mdash;The afore&s;aid John Foote was heir to his uncle by will, and a&s;&s;umed the name of Dineley; but Mary Dineley Goodere, widow of fir John, holding the Charlton e&s;tate in dower, remarried with Mr. William Ra$ner, a printer, in White Fryars, London, who being thus in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, did, by purcha&s;ing mr. Foote's right, become &s;ei&s;ed of the whole in &s;ee, and &s;oon after &s;old it to Jo&s;eph Biddle, e&s;&abque; of Ev$&s;ham, who&s;e executors &s;old it to me&s;&s;rs. Bee&s;ley, Socket, Lilly, and Bevington, of Worce&s;ter, in 1774. They obtained an act of parliament for enclo&s;ing the com|mon fields, and othe$wi&s;e much improved it at a con&s;iderable expence. It is &s;aid, that the above e&s;tate is &s;ince &s;old to others.</NOTE>. The Captain replied, the will was of no con&s;equnce, becau&s;e his deed
<PB N="11" REF="12">
was prior to it. On this &s;ir John de&s;ired to &s;ee the lea&s;e; whlch capt. Goodere refu&s;ed; and &s;wore, if he did not turn out immediately he would call in &s;ix bull dogs he had at the door, that &s;hould &s;oon make him repent his refu&s;al. Upon this &s;ix &s;tout fellows were in|troduced, who it is &s;uppo&s;ed would have done &s;ir John's bu&s;ine&s;s at that time, had not the Captain's wife, a worthy good lady, prevent|ed them, by falling at her hu&s;band's feet, and with tears intreating him to de&s;i&s;t from &s;o ra&s;h an enterpri&s;e:&mdash;This gave &s;ir John an op|portunity to &s;lip up &s;tairs, where he laid hold on a blunderbu&s;s, and threatening to &s;hoot the fir&s;t that attacked him, he made the Cap|tain march off without effecting his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>I can give very little information with re|gard to the lea&s;e Capt. Goodere would have palmed upon his brother. Such a thing was indeed once propo&s;ed by the Captain to his father, but &s;ir Edward was very angry with him, and would not li&s;ten to it. Yet grant|ing Capt. Goodere had a lea&s;e, it was, ac|cording to his own account, on &s;uch condi|tions as could by no means be advantageous to him: he was to pay his brother the full rent of the e&s;tate, to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e, and to be at the expence of keeping the gardens in order. But admitting that the Captain might be a trifling gainer by it, it was certainly a very impolitic &s;tep to exa&s;|perate a brother, who, not a year before, had a large e&s;tate put in his power to give to whom he plea&s;ed. And this unavoidably
<PB N="12" REF="13">
leads me to mention &s;omething of the reco|very which &s;ir John, jointly with his &s;on, &s;uffered about a year be&s;ore.</P>
<P>Here it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that Capt. Goodere, about the time of his father's death, was forming a &s;cheme to fru&s;trate the de&s;ign of the recovery, and render all the proceedings void. With this view he moved the court of Common Pleas again&s;t &s;ir John Dineley, his attorney, and all the parties concerned in &s;uffering the fine. The rule was obtained, by alledging that many flagrant frauds had been committed by the defendants: but, upon a full hearing; the affair was clear|ed up greatly to their honour. As this oc|currence has made a great noi&s;e, I &s;hall men|tion the particulars on which Capt. Goodere grounded his hopes, and leave the reader to form a Judgment on the equity of his pro|ceedings.</P>
<P>Sir John Dineley had one &s;on by his lady, who was taken off almo&s;t in the morning of his days, through his libertine way of living. This young gentleman's ruin was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the indulgence of his mo|ther, the pernicious advice of bad company, and his running counter to all the admoni|tions of his father. Neither was &s;ir John entirely blamele&s;s, for he treated his &s;on with the utmo&s;t indifference; and what heightened this ill treatment, was his putting the young gentleman apprentice to a &s;adler.</P>
<P>In this unhappy &s;ituation was poor Mr. Dineley, de&s;pi&s;ed by all mankind, de&s;titute
<PB N="13" REF="14">
of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, when his la&s;t &s;ick|ne&s;s attacked him. Con&s;idering in his ill|ne&s;s into what a gulph of mi&s;ery his own ill conduct had plunged him, he knew that, upon his recovery, a gaol mu&s;t be his por|tion. This horrid pro&s;pect prompted him to find out &s;ome &s;cheme to evade the impen|ding danger. There was but one way which he thought practicable; which was, to give his father, in confideration of an annuity and payment of his debts, the whole e&s;tate entailed upon him. This propo&s;al he &s;ent to &s;ir John, who came to him, and, finding no danger would attend his removal, had him conveyed to his attorney's hou&s;e in Fet|ter Lanc. As Mr. Dineley was very weak, the recovery was immediately &s;et about, and compleated two days before the young gen|tleman's death.</P>
<P>When Capt. Goodere heard of this tran|&s;action, he thought him&s;elf greatly injured, and re&s;olved at all events to &s;et a&s;ide the re|covery. With this de&s;ign the Captain &s;et out for London, and made a &s;trict &s;crutiny-into all the proceedings. After much &s;earch, he imagined he had detected a fraud which would crown all his hopes; and; elated with the&s;e thoughts, immediately commenced a &s;uit again&s;t his brother. The foundation on which Captain Goodere grounded his a&s;&s;ur|ance of &s;ucce&s;s was as follows: in the deed leading to the u&s;e of the recovery, Mr. Dineley had begun to write his name on the wrong &s;ide of the &s;eal: the attorney &s;topped
<PB N="14" REF="15">
him when he had wrote about &s;our letters, and de&s;ired him to place his name on the other &s;&s;de: this he did in the pre&s;ence of a great many credible witne&s;&s;es. The Captain law this deed, and interpreted that part of it in the following manner. <Q>&startq;It is true, this deed was drawn with my nephew's appro|bation, and he was going to &s;ign it, but expired before he could accompli&s;h it; and then his father put the pen in his &s;on's hand after he was dead, and &s;igned it.&endq;</Q> This was a bold a&s;&s;ertion, and the pretence for it weak and &s;hallow: no wonder then that the &s;uper&s;tructure fell to pieces, &s;ince its foundation was &s;o very feeble; though, to do the Captain ju&s;tice, he left no &s;$one unturned to inpport his cau&s;e, and all his actions loudly te&s;t$fy th$t the i$t$re&s;t of his family was his principal regard.&mdash;I &s;hall trou|ble the reader wit$ but one in$$ance of his prudent$al care of his children.&mdash;One o$ the principal evidences to the recovery was a woman, who&s;e low circum&s;tanc$s, Captain Goodere imagined m$de it po&s;&s;i$le for her to re&s;$&s;t the $empt$tion of a bribe. This per|&s;uaded him to make very large promi&s;es to her; but all his th$eats, promi&s;es, and &s;$$a|tagems to hide her, proved ineffectual; the witne&s;s appeared at the trial, and came off with honour.&mdash;This in&s;tance is an undeni|able proof of Captain Goodere's attachment to corruption; and he may now be truly &s;aid to have fallen into that pit which he had dug for his adver&s;aries.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16">
I come now to the mo&s;t &s;hocking part of this narrative, which is the murder of my uncle Sir John Dineley Goodere; an event &s;o barbarous and tragical, that I can &s;carce bear the thoughts of it; however, I here give the &s;ub&s;tance of the evidences and proofs that were made on the trial of Capt.

<P>THIS examinant voluntarily confe&s;&s;eth and &s;aith, That he hath been a &s;ailor on bo$rd the &s;aid &s;hip for about 17 months la&s;t pa&s;t. That about one o'clock in the night, on &s;unday la&s;t, the 18th in&s;t. he was a&s;leep in his hammock on board the &s;aid &s;hip, and was cal|led out by one Matthew M$hony, another &s;ailor on board the &s;aid &s;hip, who told him, that the Captain (meaning Capt. S. Goodere, commander of &s;a$d &s;hip) wanted to &s;peak with him in his cabin; and accordingly he went to him. The captain a&s;ked him to &s;it down, and gave him a wine gla&s;s of rum, and after that 4 or 5 more, and a&s;ked him, If he could kill a Spaniard? And this examinant an&s;wer'd. That he never did. On which the Capt. told him, He had a Job for him to do, if he would
<PB N="16" REF="17">
undertake it; and this examinant a&s;ked him, What job it was? and the Captain told him, It was to make away with his brother; who&s;e name, as this examinant is informed, was &s;ir John Dineley Goodere, bart. who was in the pur&s;er's cabin on board the &s;aid &s;hip. And the &s;aid Matt. Mahony told this examinant, That he mu&s;t go with him to help him to do it. Whereupon the &s;aid Capt. went out of the cabin fir&s;t, Mahony followed him, and this examinant went next; and when he came to the pur&s;er's cabin door, where &s;ir J. Dineley was, the Capt. was &s;tanding centinel him&s;elf at the door, with a cutla&s;s in his hand, and Mahony had entered the cabin: And this examinant entered likewi&s;e, where M$hony was talking with the &s;aid &s;ir John, and had a piece of rope, called three quarter of an inch rope, in his hand, about &s;ix feet in length, and &s;ir John lying on the bed: and, particu|larly, Mahony a&s;ked &s;ir John, How his head was, and what he had got about it? and, at la&s;t, told him, It did not &s;ignify talking about it any longer: and then fell on him on the bed, took hold of his throat with his hand, his &s;tock being on, and &s;o &s;trangled him with his &s;tock; and afterwards put the &s;aid rope about his neck, which was prepared on pur|po&s;e, w$t$ a noo&s;e in it, before $t was brought out of the Captain's cabin. And then Ma|hony hauled the rope tight about his neck, $nd upon this examinant's a&s;king him, What he did that for? he an&s;wered, <Q>&startq;For fear he &s;hould not be dead enough:&endq;</Q> And this examinant took a kni$e out of his pocket,

And he went quietly a little way, but no one ap|pearing, he re&s;$&s;ted, and refu&s;ed to go fur|ther: whereupon this examinant and his comrades &s;ometimes forcibly pu&s;hed and haul|ed, and at other t$mes carried him, over St. Augu&s;tine's butts, capt.

And they all went to|gether to the captain's cabin again, where this examinant gave the Captain &s;ir John's watch, and the Captain gave him his own in lieu of it; and then the Captain gave them both &s;ome money, and White afterwards gave this examinant eight guineas, as part of the money he took out of the decea&s;ed poc|ket: And then the Captain ordered them to be put on &s;hore in his own bo$t.

<HEAD>The examination and confe&s;&s;ion of WM. HAMMOND, EDW M'DANIEL, and CHAR BRYAN, belonging to the Ver|non Sch$oner&punc; taken and acknow|ledged before the mayor.</HEAD>
<P>I Unfortunately got acquainted with Mat|thew Mahony, a &s;eman who belonged to the Ruby man of war, and in conver&s;ation with him, at my own lodgings, I and my comrades told him we had $nipped our&s;elves to go to Jamaica; at which he de&s;$red me not to go away 'till the Friday $ollowing; for if we would but $Word$ him in getting a man that was crazy into the man of war's $oat, he &s;$id the Captain would not only reward us with a bond of $Word$, but likewi$e protect us from the p$e$s; which occ$$$on$d us on Tue&s;day to go $ee the Captain: But not finding him at his lodg$ngs, went with the &s;aid Ma$ony to the &s;ign of the White Hart, in the College Green, and, as the landlord told us, the Captain ordered us what liquors and v$ctuals we plea&s;ed to call for. But we being afraid to go nigh the man of war's boat, acquainted the &s;aid M$hony with our doubts, and he immediately informed the Captain thereof; wh$ told us, to be under no dread, for it was not worth his while to lye in that man|ner for three or four &s;eamen; but he wanted to lay hold of a man who was a lunatic, and ruining him&s;elf, his $amily, and him the &s;aid Captain; and that he wanted him on board
<PB N="24" REF="25">
to keep him out of the lawyer's and affidavit men's hands; and promi&s;ed that no harm &s;hould attend us on that account; and that he would not only give us a plentiful reward, but likewi&s;e protect us from all manner of pre&s;s. That when the &s;aid gentleman came out of mr. Smith's hou&s;e in the green, the Captain ordered us not to touch him, but to follow him, and &s;ee if he put up at any hou&s;e <HI>in</HI> the city; which we did; but the gentle|man continuing his journey without &s;topping we returned back; and, on our return, Ma|hony went into the Coffee hou&s;e near the Change, and &s;poke to the Captain, who told him we &s;hould have a better opportunity, and de&s;ired of us not to be out of the way. Accordingly we all met on the Sunday fol|lowing, and waited in the Green 'till the gentleman came out of mr. Smith's, where he left the Captain behind him; and being encouraged by Mahony and others belong|ing to the &s;aid Ship, we &s;topped him, and hauled him to the man of war's boat, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome of the crew. The Captain came prciently after us to the boat, where we left them, and returned to our lodgings, and &s;taid there all night. In the morning fol|lowing, before we were out of bed, Mahony and one Charles White came to out lodgings, and made us get up to drink punch, which we did; but &s;eeing White have a quantity of gold, and Mahony have a gold watch, it made us imagine they had robbed the gentle|man, and thereupon we went directly on board the man of war, to acquaint the Cap|tain;

but when we came on board we found the Captain a pri&s;oner for a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the death of the gentleman, and the Lieutenant, knowing that we helped to bring him to the boat, ordered us to be confined, where we remained for eight-days, 'till the Mayor &s;ent for us, who, after examining us, committed us to Newgate, where we now remain.</P>

<P>Mr. HOBBS &s;worn.&mdash;Mr. Hobbs. On Monday, Jan. 12, 1740-1, the Captain (who was dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;carlet cloak, with a &s;word by his &s;ide) and Mahony came to my hou&s;e, and defiring to &s;ee an upper room, went up &s;tairs, when the Captain looking out of the window, &s;aid to Mahony, Here's a fine pro&s;|pect of the tower, &amp;c. and then a&s;bed, If he eould not breakfa&s;t in that room next morn|ing at n&s;ne o'clock, on a di&s;h of coffee? But I endeavouring to recommend him to the coffee-hou&s;e a little below, he replied, he liked the room (which pre&s;ented to mr. Smith's hou&s;e in the Green) and had much rather have his breakfa&s;t there than at the coffee-hou&s;e, and in&s;i&s;ted very much on it.&mdash;Then, after calling for a pint of ale for Ma|hony, and paying for it, they both depart|ed; the Captain telling me to mind the hour for his breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day, about &s;even or eight o'clock, the Captain came by him&s;elf, dre&s;t in a drab coloured coat, with the cape buatoned clo$e
<PB N="26" REF="27">
up under his hat, covering mo&s;t of his face, in&s;omuch that I did not know, for &s;ome time, that it was the &s;ame gentleman that was there the day before; and I was then making a fire in the room: The &s;hutters of the windows not being open, he de&s;ired me to open them, which I did, and in the par|lour, in which the Captain &s;tood near half an hour, from whence he had a perfect view of mr. Jarrit Smith's hou&s;e; (and this was the day mr. Smith &s;peaks of, when &s;$r John promi&s;ed to be with him to &s;ettle the loan, &amp;c.) That about the time the breakfa&s;t was got ready&punc; Mahony and &s;even or eight more came in (among&s;t whom were M'Daniel, Hammond, and Bryan) when Mahony en|quired if the Captain of the Man of war was there? And being told by me, that the gentleman who was with him the day before was there, (but whether he was the Captain of the Man of war he could not tell:) Ma|hony de&s;ired to be admitted to him, with whom he &s;tayed a con&s;iderable time; when the Captain ordered the men below to have what they would eat and drink, &amp;c. during which time Mahony often went up and down, and the others were often looking out, either at the door or at the window, towards mr. Smith's hou&s;e; and after they had &s;pent a con&s;iderable time there, Mahony calls out to the Po&s;&s;e, and &s;hews them &s;ir John's man, who was riding one hor&s;e and leading ano|ther, before mr.

come out of mr. Smith's, and mount his hor&s;e; and, as he mounted his hor&s;e, I heard the Captain call to Mahony, telling him, That is he, look well at him, but do not touch him; on which they all went out, and Mahony and the re&s;t returning about half an hour after, be&s;poke the &s;ame room for the Sunday following.</P>
<P>Accordingly on that day, Mahony, Mac Daniel, Hammond, and Bryan, with three or four others, came to the White Hart, and drank a con&s;iderable time; that all the time they were there, one or other was conti|nually looking out towards mr. Smith's; that about five that evening &s;ir John was &s;een coming out of mr. Smith's, with a velvet cap on, under a broad brim hat, who came down the hill by him&s;elf; at the &s;ight of whom the ruffians ru&s;hed out, and the Cap|tain was &s;een &s;hortly to follow.&mdash;When it was that &s;ir John was &s;eized and kidnapped away, and afterwards murdered, will fully appe$r by other witne&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>EDWARD JONES &s;worn.&mdash;Mr. Jones. On Sunday J$n. 15, about &s;even at night, Capt. Goodere brought his brother &s;ir John on board, and conveyed him down into the Pur&s;er's cabin by force. When he was down, the Captain a&s;ked, whether the cabin was clear (for on the Thur&s;day before the Captain had ordered me to get the Pur&s;er's cabin ready for a gentleman who was to come on
<PB N="28" REF="29">
board.) I an&s;wered, Yes, &s;ir. He then opened the door, and the people of the &s;hip forced &s;ir John in, he groaning all the while. That when he was in, the Captain called for his &s;teward, and told him to bring a bottle of rum and a gla&s;s. That the Captain then a&s;ked &s;ir John, How he did? Sir John com|plained of pains, e&s;pecially in his thigh. That the Captain a&s;ked him, If he would drink a dram? Sir John &s;aid, He had drank nothing but water the&s;e two years. That the Captain then a&s;ked him, If he would have any rum to bathe his thigh? Sir John an|&s;wered. No. That the Captain ordered a dram for Mahony and Eli&s;ha Cole; and after they had had a dram, they all came out of the cabin. That then Cole defired Leave to &s;peak to the gentleman [&s;ir John], thinking he was the Captain of the &s;hip he was pre&s;&s;ed out of. That Cole went in, and told &s;ir John, He did his duty on board the Charles as well as another man, and &s;wore he would have his wages, Sir John told him. He did not know him, or any thing of the Charles: On which he again &s;wore. He'd have his wages before he went out of the &s;hip; for that. if he was not the Captain, he was the Owner. Soon after Cole went out, and the Captain called one of the carpenters to put two &s;trong bolts on the Pur&s;er's cabin door, which was accord|ingly done. That about this time, &s;ir John a&s;ked&punc; If he could &s;peak to any of the offi|cers on board. That the carpenter an&s;wered. I am the carpenter. Sir John a&s;ked, If he
<PB N="29" REF="30">
could &s;peak a word with him? He replied, An hundred, if he pleafed. That the car|penter opening the door, in order to clench the &s;taples, &s;ir John a&s;ked me, What his bro|ther Sam was going to do with him; What is he going to murder me? I replied, No; he is willing to have your company, &s;ir; he does it for your good. But &s;ir John &s;aid, What will become of my &s;ervants and e&s;tate all this time? On this I retired, and pre&s;ently the Capt in came down again, and ordered the Doctor's fir&s;t mate to feel his pul&s;e, &s;aying, We mu&s;t patch him up as well as we can; he is a crazy old fellow, go in and feel his pul&s;e. Accordingly the Doctor went in, and, when he came to &s;ir John, he a&s;ked him, Where his pains were? He an&s;wered, He lately came from Bath, and had a pain in his head; and $omplained of many other pains occa|&s;ioned by the rough u&s;age in bringing him on board. Says the Captain, Doctor, feel his pul&s;e, and come out. So accordingly the Doctor came out, and the cabin door was &s;hut. After this I heard him praying for God to be comfortable to him in his afflic|tions, for that he believed he was going to be murdered; and hoped it would be brought to light, for that it was impo&s;&s;ible it could be done without &s;omebody hearing or &s;eeing it. About nine o'clock at night I heard him knocking and calling out, Ho! ho! brother &s;ailors! (I have almo&s;t forgot my &s;ea-terms) let me have a bucket to p$&s;s in and ea&s;e my|&s;elf, for it will be a &s;hame to do if in the
<PB N="30" REF="31">
cabin. Then I looked out at the cabin door, and called to the centry to get &s;omething for the gentleman to ea&s;e him&s;elf in. Pre&s;$ntly after Mahony came with the bucket; when &s;ir John told him of his exploits, and that he had been Captain of an Indiaman, &amp;c. About two or three o'clock in the morning, my wi&s;e waked me; when I heard a va&s;t &s;truggling at fir&s;t, and the old gentlem$n cried out, Twenty guineas! Take it! Take it! Mu&s;t I die! Mu&s;t I die! and very &s;oon after all was quiet: Then a candle was handed into the cab$n, and I &s;aw, thro' the crevice of the partition, Mahony hold the candle in his hand, &amp; White plundered his pockets, turning his body in order to come at it, and took out of his poc|kets his watch and money; and White not getting the watch out of &s;ir John's pocket, Mahony &s;aid to him, D&mdash;n it, lay hold of the chain; and it was &s;ome time before they got the watch out of his pocket, being forced at la&s;t to unbutton his breeches. White put his hand into one pocket and found nothing but &s;ilver, and putting his hand into the other, &s;aid, Here it is! Then he put his hand into another pocket and found a piece of paper, which he was going to read, but that Mahony damned him, bid|ding him put it in his pocket, and not &s;tand to read it now; and in about a minute after, I &s;aw a white hand on the throat of the de|cea&s;ed, which I took to be the captain's; and pre&s;ently they all went out of the cabin, and left the decea&s;ed alone. I then went to the doctor's mate and the centry, and, by their
<PB N="31" REF="32">
opinion, we took the gentleman to be dead. Then I went to the lieutenant, and told him what I had &s;een and heard, and that Maho|ny and White had murder$d the gentleman, and that I believed the C$ptain was concern|ed. The lieutenant was very dubious of the truth at fir&s;t, telling me, he did not think the Captain would be guilty of any &s;uch thing; but on my giving him &s;uch plain demon&s;trations of the fact, he began to think there was &s;omething in it. While we were talking, the mid&s;hipman came to acqua$nt the lieutenant, that the Captain had order'd Mahony and White a&s;hore; then he &s;wore they &s;hould not go, for they were the two per&s;ons that had killed the gentleman: but the mid&s;hipman returning to the captain, he ordered they &s;hould be put a&s;hore imme|diately, and accordingly they were.</P>
<P>About nine or ten in the morning, the lieutenant and gunner contrived that I &s;hould go in, and complain I had lo&s;t &s;ix guineas out of my che&s;t; and going with this com|plaint. I &s;eized the captain as he was walking with his hands behind him, and the re&s;t, who were at hand, ru&s;hed in after me. The Captain being thus &s;eized, he cried out, Hay! Hay! What have I done?&mdash;Upon which I replied, Sir, you are my pri&s;oner; you was the cau&s;e of your Brothers death la&s;t night. Then the captain &s;aid, If there is murder done in the &s;hip I know nothing of it. Ac|cordingly he was &s;ecured, and the barge or|dered out, for four of the crew to pur&s;ue White and Mahony. They took White at

the Bell, in Mar&s;h &s;treet, ($wearing and damning his mother for &s;ending him $o much money,) very much in liquor. He w$s &s;oon conquered, and brought before a mag$&s;trate; but was &s;o drunk that his confe&s;&s;ion was not taken 'till next morning.&mdash;A$out twelve at night they took Mahony at a private hou&s;e oppo&s;ite the Ship, on St. Mi$hael's Hill Steps, and conveyed him before a magi&s;trate, and when he was &s;ober, he al&s;o m$de his confe&s;&s;ion of the murder.</P>
<P>Council. Call Mrs. Jones.&mdash;[mrs. Jones &s;worn.]&mdash;Madam, acquaint the court with what you know, or have &s;een, relating to the murder of $ir John Dineley Goodere.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones. On &s;unday the 18th of Jan. 1740-1, &s;omebody came down, and the Cap|tain a&s;ked, If the cabin was clean? biding them bring the old mad fellow in. Then he called for the doctor, and told him, He had got an old mad fellow there, and that he mu&s;t doctor him as well as he could. Then they went into the cabin, when the Captain a&s;ked his brother, How he did now? Sir John told him; He had a great pain in his arms and thighs by the men's hauling him down to the boat. Then the captain a&s;ked him, If would drink a dram? Sir John told him, No; for he had dra$ nothing but water the$e two years. Then the captain &s;aid he $hould have &s;omething to anoint his thigh, and called for the &s;tewaed to bring a bottle of Rum; when the captain again a&s;ked his brother, If he would drink? who an&s;wered, No. On which the captain &s;aid, it is much
<PB N="33" REF="34">
the better for you. And, at this time, &s;he perceived there was in the cabin one Eli&s;ha Cole, whom the captain ordered a dram for, and bid him &s;it down. Sir John &s;till com|plaining of his legs and arms, the captain ordered Mahony to pull his &s;tockings off: on which &s;ir John &s;aid, Do not &s;trip me before I am dead. Then the captain made an&s;wer, Do not mind him, for he is crazy.&mdash;Says &s;ir John to his brother, Brother S$m, what do you bring me here for? You cannot murder me without letting &s;omebody know of it: telling him &s;everal times, he would rot in a gaol for it. That then the captain went to the doctor's mate, and &s;ent him to feel his pul&s;e; but charged him not to talk to him much. That in obedience to the captain's command, the doctor went to &s;ir John, and felt his pul&s;e, and &s;ir John told him, He had a great pain in his head; that he had been a week at Bath, &s;ince which his head was wor&s;e than ever. Then the captain went up to &s;upper; mean while the carpenter came to put two bolts on the cabin door; when &s;ir John a&s;ked M$hony (who was con&s;tantly to and &s;ro,) If he could &s;peak with one of the officers? Mahony told him, They were all on Shore except the carpenter, and he was nailing on the bolts. On this &s;ir John a&s;ked, If he was going to be nailed in? M$hony replied, No, &s;ir: then, &s;ays &s;ir John, I de|&s;ire to &s;peak with the carpenter. That on this Mahony went out of the cabin, but neglected to acquaint the carpenter of it; &s;o &s;ir John called the carpenter him&s;elf, and
<PB N="34" REF="35">
a&s;ked him. If he plea&s;ed to hear him &s;peak one word? The carpenter replied, Aye, twenty, if you plea&s;e, &s;ir. That then he a&s;ked the carpenter, What his Brother meant by bringing him there? The carpenter re|plied, He hoped it was for his good: Sir John made an&s;wer, But what will my &s;ervants and my e&s;tates do the while? I &s;uppo&s;e my brother tells you I am a madman; but I am not; though he is enough to drive me m$d: on which the carpenter went out. That about ten o'clock, the captain came down again with a pair of &s;tockings in his hand, and a&s;ked his brother, If he would put them on? &s;ir John told him, No; he would 'bide as he was. Th$t at this time &s;ir John did not talk much, but told his brother, He would rot in a gaol. On this the captain bid Mahony &s;ee if he h$d any k$$fe about him; when &s;ir John took a little knife out of his pocket, and gave it to M$hony, and went and laid him&s;elf on the bed directly: then the captain went out, and &s;poke aload, and ch$rged (I &s;uppo&s;e the centry) that no one &s;hould come near him; for that by and by he would kick and tear, and make a noi&s;e as though he would tear the cabin down: for he was a madman.&mdash;That then the captain went out again, and $at in the doctor's birth, &s;aying to mr. M$r$h, the mid hipman, You mu&s;t go a&s;hore in the morning between three and four o'clock: and al&s;o ordered him to go to the po&s;t-office for the letters; and if any body made enquiry for the old mad fellow, he &s;hould tell them, That he had taken him
<PB N="35" REF="36">
on board to prevent his rotting in a gaol: in &s;hort, continued he, the world has blam'd me that I have not done it be$ore.&mdash;That about twelve, &s;ir John a&s;ked Mahony for the knife, &s;aying, What, does my brother think I am going to make away with my&s;elf? God forbid! The world is bad enough to do it: telling Mahony, It was his decea&s;ed &s;on's knife and that he would have it again. And after he had talked to him &s;ometime, he bid him go out, for he could '$$de by him&s;elf. That Mahony &s;aid to him, Sir, I mu&s;t bide and t$ke ca$e of you $Word$ i$mediately put the candle out. Sir John &s;till kept talking to Mahony, praying to God to give him patience: and Mahony told him, He mu&s;t have patience. Sir John replied, &s;ighing, I had as good. Then &s;$r John $$id to Ma|hony, If a great many gentlemen $n Bri&s;tol did but know how he was u&s;ed, they would $et$h him from thence: on which Mahony told him, He &s;hould go a&s;hore in the morn|ing, and that then he would convey any let|ters to the po&s;t-office, if he plea&s;ed.&mdash;That, &s;ome time after two, &s;he happened to awake, when &s;$e heard Mahony per&s;uading &s;ir John to go to &s;leep. That &s;ir John and he kept talking for &s;ome time, when, on a &s;udden, &s;he heard a great &s;trugling, and two people whi&s;pering in the cabin, and &s;ir John groan|ing and m$king a lamentable noi&s;e, mutter|ing out, Murder! Help, for God's &s;ake! giving &s;everal kecks with his throat. Tha$ &s;omebody offering to open the door, (&s;uppo|&s;ed to be the captain) one of tho&s;e within
<PB N="36" REF="37">
&s;aid, Keep out you Negro; or, Keep the door too, you Negro That while that per&s;on was at the door, fir John &s;aid, Here's Twenty guineas for you! Take it! Take it! Mu&s;t I die! Mu&s;t I die! Between the words he gave &s;everal kecks, and &s;poke inwardly, Oh, my life! Which were the la&s;t words he &s;poke. That &s;ome time after a light was brought in, which &s;he &s;aw in Mahony's hand: then &s;he &s;aw a man trying to pull &s;ir John upon his back, his face lying towards the boards; and &s;aw White pull his face, in order to come at his pocket; when Mahony &s;aid, D&mdash;mn it, pull his watch out. The per&s;on replied, He could not. Then Mahony told him to pull it out by the chain. That then &s;he &s;aid to her hu&s;band, The gentleman is dead, for they are robbing him: on which her hu&s;band got up, and looked thro' the crevice of the par|tition; her fight being intercepted by him, &s;he could not &s;ee the watch drawn out of the pocket, tho' &s;he afterwards &s;aw White give it Mahony, bidding him put it in his pocket. Pre&s;ently after; &s;he heard one &s;ay, Here's no|thing but &s;ilver! Then &s;he heard him &s;ay, Here's the gold! Hearing no more of them in the cabin, &s;he heard them go out, bolt &amp; lock the door. Several words were &s;poken when they went out, which &s;he did not under&s;tand, only Mahony &s;aid, in a flutter, Which way &s;hall I go? The other an&s;wer'd, (who was White by his voice) Follow me, my boy! and they went off. Which is all I know of the matter, an't plea&s;e your Lord&s;hip.</P>

Court. Call another witne&s;s.&mdash;[Duncan Buchanan &s;worn.]</P>
<P>D. Buchanan. On Jan. 13, 1740-1, the captain ordered the barge and yawl up (meach of which was a mid&s;hipman) and ordered a mid&s;hipman and &s;ix of the bargemen to go to the White Hart, the Foot of the College green. That when they came there, they &s;aw the Captain, Mahony, and five of the Privateer's, who were drinking hot Flip in a room by them&s;elves, whil&s;t him&s;elf and the five bargemen were &s;itting in the public kit|chen drinking of ale. That &s;hortly after he &s;aw &s;ir John come from mr. Smith's, oppo&s;ite the White Hart, where his man was waiting for him, with pi&s;tols to each of their hor&s;es: That the Privateer's men &s;eeing him, they ru&s;hed out together, and were for &s;eizing &s;ir John then; but the Captain ordered them not to touch him at that time, but to follow him, and &s;ee which way he went. That they followed him round the corner, and the Cap|tain after them; but the captain returned to the White Hart again in about an hour, and ordered the boat down.&mdash;That on the &s;un|day following, the &s;ame gentleman he &s;aw in the Green was brought on board the Ruby: That as he was bringing on board, the Capt. bid the people not mind what he &s;aid, for he was a madman; but he would bring him to his &s;en&s;es by and by. That he &s;aw no more of him at that time. That at twelve o'clock he was placed centry over &s;ir John, and a little after the Capt. &s;ent his man for him:
<PB N="38" REF="40">
That he gave the centry at the gun-room charge, that nobody &s;hould come down the ladder 'till he had &s;poke with the Captain. That when he went into the Captain's cabin, he &s;aw the Captain and Mahony with a bottle of Rum and a gla&s;s before them, out of which he had a dram. That the Captain a&s;ked him, If his brother made any noi&s;e? On which he told him, That he made a little moan the time he was there. The Captain replied, I know the rea&s;on of that, he wants to be &s;hifted: I will come down and &s;hift him with dry &s;tockings pre&s;ently. That when he went out, the C$ptain told him to let nobody into the cabin to &s;ir John but Mahony. Says Mahony, You may let ano|ther go, becau&s;e&mdash;here he &s;topped. About two, the Captain came down, and a&s;ked him, If his brother made any noi&s;e? and li&s;tened him&s;elf at the cabin door. Then the Capt. &s;aid to him, Centry, give me the &s;word, and you go upon deck; becau&s;e I want to talk to my brother privately: That accordingly he gave him the &s;word, and went up into the gun-room, and there walked. That a little while after down came Mahony, and the Centry a&s;ked, Where he was going? He &s;aid, D&mdash;n you, you dog, what is that to you? D&mdash;n you, how bu&s;y you make your&s;elf! That then Mahony went down into the cock|plt, and &s;o into the Pur&s;er's cabin. That &s;oon after, he heard &s;ir John mutter out, Murder! Then every thing was quiet for a little while, and the Captain took the lan|thorn
<PB N="39" REF="41">
that was hanging up, and gave it into the cabin him&s;elf. That &s;eeing the candle given into the cabin, he thought it not pro|per for the Captain to &s;tand without a light, and therefore lighted a candle in the gun|room, and was going down into the cockpit, where the Captain was &s;tanding with a &s;word in his hand; but on his approach the Capt. held the &s;word to his brea&s;t, &s;aying, Stay where you are, That accordingly he went back, and walked for a &s;mall time in the gun|room: That the Captain came to the foot of the ladder with the candle out, telling him to light it and come down: which he accordingly did. Then the Captain gave him the &s;word, and bid him take his po&s;t; locking and bolting the cabin door, and put|ting the key in his pocket (which before the murder was left in the door;) telling him, If he heard his brother make any more noi&s;e, to &s;end to him and let him know it.</P>
<P>Theodore Cote, ma&s;ter of the Ruby, de|clar'd, He &s;aw the gentleman brought on board, and the &s;hip was then in King's Road. That in the morning the Captain &s;ent for him, and told him, he had an order from the Ad|miralty to go to &s;ea, though he did not care if he got no farther than the Holmes; and a&s;ked him, If there was good anchoring ground there? Mr. Cote replied, There was no &s;uch thing as anchoring there. The Captain in&s;i&s;ted very much on going, but I told him, The &s;hip was an old tattered ve&s;&s;el,
<PB N="40" REF="42">
and that he mu&s;t go again&s;t wind and tide: So I did not care to venture to move the &s;hip from where &s;he was.</P>
<Q>[Then there aro&s;e a di&s;pute, whether the Ship was really in the Liberties of the city and county of Bri&s;tol; the Captain endeavouring to prove, that &s;he rode a good way up the Severn. But &s;everal of the olde&s;t officers being &s;worn, and depo&s;ing that they had for many years &s;er|ved Proce&s;&s;es out of the courts of Bri&s;tol and We&s;tmin&s;ter in King's Road, it proved a &s;ufficient pre|cedent to confirm the authority of the Court.]</Q>
<P>Mr. Williams &s;wore, That he &s;teered the Barge &s;ir John was carried down in, and heard a great deal of talk, the &s;ub&s;tance of which is before recited by the other Evidence; particularly that part of it, where &s;ir John advi&s;ed the Captain, after he had murdered him to go and hang him&s;elf, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. Weller, the carpenter, proved that he put the bolts upon the Pur&s;er's cabin door, by the Captain's order, whil&s;t &s;ir John was in the cabin.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43">
William M'Ginnis &s;wore, That he &s;aw the Captain &s;tand at the Pur&s;er's cabin door, at the time of the murder, with a drawn &s;word in his hand; and that when he offered to draw near him, the Captain held up his &s;word, and bid him keep back.</P>
<P>Mr. Duggen, doctor's mate, That the Captain ordered him into the cabin to &s;eel the gentleman's pul&s;e, and that he acquaint|ed the Captain that his pul&s;e was regular.</P>
<P>The Captain in his defence pleaded the ut|mo&s;t innocence; alledging, That could it be thought he could be guilty of the murder of his brother, whereas by his death he lo&s;t at lea&s;t 40,00 l.?&mdash;That fickne&s;s and di&s;|order in the pri&s;on, debarred him of his law|yer and friends conver&s;ing with him.&mdash;That he applied to the Captain of the Ruby as &s;oon as he was allowed pen, ink, and paper, for his evidences on &s;hip board (which were lieutenant Perry; the doctor; mr. Robert Haythorn, mr. Richard Wil&s;on, and Hugh Di&s;cal:)&mdash;That he applied to the lords of the admiralty, who &s;ent him an order, but that the &s;hip &s;ailed the day before it arrived: which debarred him of ju&s;tifying him&s;elf, they being material evidences:&mdash;That the News Papers being full of reflecting fal&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, was a great detriment to him:&mdash;Then he urged (in a low &s;peech) That his pro&s;ecutors would &s;et ea&s;y in the birth right of his innocent children, &s;hould he be convicted:&mdash;In vindication of &s;eizing &s;ir John in that manner, he urge$$, That he

was a lunatic, and therefore he did it to take care of him:&mdash;That his being taken in the day-time on board, was plain there was no &s;ecret de&s;ign, nor harm infended to come to him:&mdash;And that when he parted with him at mr. Smith's, he behaved in a very mad manner, and took no leave <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Friend to both of them, at Bri&s;tol, who knew their mortal antipathy invited them once to dinner, in hopes to reconcile them, and &s;ays, That they parted that evening in &s;eeming Friend|&s;hip.&mdash;Captain Goodere's &s;on, who was heir to the Title, but being young at the untimely death of his father, did, when he was grown up, take the name of &s;ir John Dineley Goodere, and afterwards litigated with divers per&s;ons for part of the patrimony of his father and uncle, and &s;oon &s;pent what &s;mall &s;hare he recovered by it.&mdash;He afterwards went to Scotland, and &s;tudied phy|$ic there, becoming an $tinerant doctor, where he is now living: at his decea&s;e the Dineley and Goodere's family will be quite extinct</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In order to prove &s;ir John a lunatic, he called upon mrs. Gethens, to &s;ignify, That he had intimated to her &s;ome time before his intention of &s;ecuring &s;ir John as a luna|t$c; and that he propo&s;ed to her to have a g$rret for air, and other conveniencies; and that Mahony was to attend him, and to have five &s;hillings a week for his pains:&mdash;[Though mrs. Gethens, when called on, declared &s;he knew nothing of Mahony, nor of any &s;uch bargain.]&mdash;That the people
<PB N="43" REF="45">
on board knew of his coming a week before he came, to prevent his running out the e&s;tate; therefore, he intimated, that he mu&s;t be very &s;illy to bring a per&s;on to three hun|dred evidences to commit a vile act, where nathing can be kept a Secret above four hours.</P>
<P>The Captain likewi&s;e brought two young women to prove &s;ir John a lunatic; one of whom &s;aid, She believed him to be mad, becau&s;e he would get up in the middle of the night and di&s;turb all the &s;ervants: That &s;ometimes he would bu&s;y him&s;elf in hanging on the pot, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A Gentleman was called by Captain Good$re to his character; when being a&s;k|ed, Whether he knew &s;ir John to be any way mad$ or the like; decla$ed, That he was &s;o f$r from being a lunatic, that he had more &s;en&s;e than the whole family.&mdash;Sir John was al&s;o proved by mr.

<HEAD>An ACCOUNT of Capt. GOODERE's Behaviour a&s;ter Sentence of Death.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN he returned to Newgate, he went on foot, with a &s;carlet cloak on, and, as he pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treets, he was very particular in making his obei&s;ance to the gentry and others of his acquaintance. After which his lady, who bears the charac|ter of a worthy gentlewoman, &s;pared no pains for his life, and petitioned that his &s;entence of death might be mitigated, or el&s;e changed into tran&s;portation or impri&s;onment. But &s;he not having &s;ucce&s;s in her application for mercy, his Friends de&s;ired him to turn his thoughts upon eternity. for that there was no hope of any favour from the higher pow|ers. <Q>And on the 8th of April, as a Me|mento Mori, his coffin was carried into his apartment in the gaol, with this in&s;cription, &startq;SAMUEL GOODERE, aged 53 years, who departed this life, April 15, 1741;&endq;</Q> at the &s;ight of which he was very much ca&s;t
<PB N="45" REF="47">
down, and became &s;orrowful; and then the rev. mr. We&s;ton, curate of St. Peter's, and mr. Penro&s;e, rector of St. Wa&s;bro&s;e, two worthy and learned divines, were de&s;ired to attend him, and prepare him for another world. They &s;eriou&s;ly pre&s;&s;ed him to the acknowledgment of his crime; but he per|&s;i&s;ted that he had no intention to murder his brother, but only to bring him from tho&s;e meafures he was pur&s;uing, &s;o highly inju|rious to the family.</P>
<P>Several Sermons were preached to him to bring him to a &s;en&s;e of religion; and the &s;unday before he died, the rev. mr. Rogers, rector of St. Peter's and Ocle, in Hereford|&s;hire, and an intimate friend of his, preach|ed from the following words: <Q>&startq;For if we believe that Je&s;us died, and ro&s;e again, even &s;o them al&s;o which &s;leep in Je&s;us will God bring with him. I. $he&s;&s;. iv. 14.&endq;</Q> Which was done in &s;uch a pathe|tic manner, that it drew tears from his eyes and mo&s;t of his audience.</P>
<P>At length the&s;e gentlemen, by the power and grace of their admonitions, &s;o molified his heart, that at la&s;t they prevailed over him, (being terrified with God's ju&s;tice, and encouraged by his mercies) and with tears and groans he confe&s;&s;ed the murder of his brother, and bitterly repented it; thanking tho&s;e godly divines for their charity, care, and zeal for his &s;oul, and be&s;ought them to pray to the Lord to forgive him and receive him into his ble&s;t abodes. And then he
<PB N="46" REF="48">
&s;pent mo&s;t of his time in prayer, &s;inging of p&s;alms, reading, meditation, and good di&s;|cour&s;es: his thoughts being wholly taken up with preparations to die: And it is hoped, that through the ble&s;&s;ing of God and the charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e pious men, he was brought to a true repentance and abhor|rence of his atrocious crime.</P>
<P>Some days before he died, he earne&s;tly de&s;ired to partake of the Lord's Supper; but the mini&s;ter told him, he could not comply with his reque&s;t, until he had openly confe&s;&s;ed his crime, and declared him&s;elf to have truly repented of it.</P>
<P>He appeared very &s;orrowful, and could not refrain from tears, when he thought of his brother: His ingratitude to him, and the di&s;grace brought on his family, pre&s;ent|ed them&s;elwes alternately to his tortured mind, which gave him much unea&s;ine&s;s, and added to the agonies of his approaching end. He prayed for forgivene&s;s of God, and that mankind might learn, from his example, to re&s;train their pa&s;&s;ion, and not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be carried beyond the bounds of rea&s;on and humanity. He was much concerned he had not a more favour|able &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon him, or at lea&s;t, to die like a gentleman; but, at the &s;ame time, reflecting on his crimes, he acknowledged the ju&s;tice of the decree which the court had pa&s;&s;ed on him: And before he died, he took the &s;acrament with his lady, who de|parted

out of the city of Bri&s;tol immediately afterwards.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the 15th day of April, 1741, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, captain Goodere was conveyed in a mourn|ing chariot, through the greate&s;t croud as ever was known in Bri&s;tol. An infinite number of people of all ranks were a&s;&s;em|bled at St. Michael's Hill, which was the plaee appointed for his and his $ellow &s;uf|ferers execution, to &s;ee them take their la&s;t farewell of this world; when the captain behaved with a becoming decency, and the tranquility of a &s;en&s;$ble man and a true penitent.</P>
<P>After &s;ome private di&s;cour&s;e with mr. Pen|ro&s;e, he confe&s;&s;ed the c$$me, and that it was the ju&s;tice of God that he &s;hould under|go th$t ignominous death; he be&s;ought the &s;pectators to pray for his &s;oul; he lamented his cruelty to his brother, and &s;aid, that his brother's cutting off the entail of the e&s;tate, to the prejudice of his family, had carried his re$entment beyond rea&s;on, and thereby brought him to this &s;hameful end; he ex|horted them to take example by him; and &s;olemnly freed his lady, and other relations, from being any way acce&s;&s;ary, or acquainted with his intention to murder his brother. He then joined in prayers with mr. Penro&s;e, and, after having &s;ung a p&s;alm, he embrac|ed and thanked the mini&s;ter for his offices in his behalf; and, in a mo&s;t tender manner,
<PB N="48" REF="50">
took leave of his acquaintance about him; and was heard to &s;ay, at &s;everal different times, Lord do not reward me according to my de&s;erts.</P>
<P>When he came to the fatal tree, and &s;aw Mahony and White, he embraced them with very great tenderne&s;s, and was much grieved to think he was the means of bring|ing them to that untimely end. And, ac|cording to his de&s;ire, when he dropped his handkerchief, which was the fignal, he was turned off; whil&s;t many of the &s;pecta|tors &s;ent up their prayers and good wi&s;hes for his eternal welfare.</P>
<P>After he had hung above an hour and a quarter he was cut down, and his corp&s;e was carried in a hear&s;e back to Newgate, and it lay there all night, by order of the ma|gi&s;trates, in order to prevent any art being made u$e of to bring him to life; and the next day he was carried in a hear&s;e, with &s;ix hor&s;es, to be buried in Hereford among&s;t his Ance&s;tors.</P>
