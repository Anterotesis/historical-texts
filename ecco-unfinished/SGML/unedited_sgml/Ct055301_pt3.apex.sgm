<P>THE members of the privy council concealed the death of Mary for &s;ome hours, during which they deliberated upon the mea|&s;ures they &s;hould pur&s;ue. At length they imparted this event to the hou&s;e of lords, who made no &s;cruple of declaring for the prince&s;s Eli|zabeth, who &s;ucceeded according to the will of her father Henry, and was agreeable to the nation in general. The majority of the peers were either al|together indifferent with regard to religion, or &s;ecretly favoured the reforma|tion; and the re&s;t believed that popery was too firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed to be over|thrown by a female &s;overeign, who was &s;o far from being a bigot, that &s;he
<PB N="3" REF="50">
conformed to the religion of her &s;i&s;ter, and even declared her&s;elf a Roman ca|tholic. The lords having deputed Heath archbi&s;hop of York, to &s;ignify<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> their re&s;olution to the lower hou&s;e, it was unanimou&s;ly approved by the com|mons; and Elizabeth was immediately proclaimed, amid&s;t the acclamations of the people, in the five and twentieth year of her age. She forthwith repaired from Hatfield to London; and, after having received the compliments of the nobility, &s;he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the different powers of Europe to notify her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of England. Lord Cobham was di&s;patched to Philip, whom &s;he con&s;idered as her friend and ally; Sir Thomas Chalons &s;et out for the imperial court; and &s;he joined Howard lord Effingham to Thirleby bi&s;hop of Ely, and doctor Wotton, who were the plenipotentiaries at the congre&s;s of Cambray. Killegrew was &s;ent to &s;ound the prote&s;tant princes of Germany; and Karne had orders to make the pope acquainted with the death of Mary, and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of Elizabeth. Then &s;he formed her council, in which &s;he $etained thirteen of her &s;i&s;ter's coun&s;ellors, to whom &s;he joined eight per&s;ons who were attached to the prote&s;tant religion <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The old members were Heath archbi&s;hop of York; Pawlet Marquis of Winche&s;ter, lord $$gh trea&s;urer; Fi$z-Allen earl of Arundel; T$l|bot $arl of Shrew&s;bury, Stanley $arl of Derby$ H$rb$rt earl of Pembroke; the lord Ch$ton$ high admiral; lord Howard of E&s;&s;ingham, chamberlain; Sir Thomas Ch$pey, Sir William Petre, Sir John Ma$on, Sir Richard Sackville, and Nicholas Wo$$on.</NOTE>. Philip of Spain was not a little alarmed at the death of his con&s;ort. He dreaded Elizabeth's marrying a prote&s;tant prince, in which ca&s;e all his influence in England would vani&s;h: he was not without fear that the French king would &s;upport the claim of Mary queen of Scots, and unite England, Scotland, and Ireland, to his own dominions. In order to prevent &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion of power to his enemies, he &s;ent the count de Feria to propo&s;e a match between him and Elizabeth, who, notwith&s;tand|ing his promi&s;e to procure a di&s;pen&s;ation from the pope, declined the pro|po&s;al; though in &s;uch obliging terms, that the king of Spain could not ju&s;tly take offence at her refu&s;al. Indeed &s;he had great rea&s;on to avoid a rupture with that monarch; for &s;he was involved in a war with France and Scotland; the crown  was overwhelmed with debts contracted in the two preceding reigns, and the finances of the kingdom were quite exhau&s;ted: be&s;ides, &s;he was not a little embarra&s;&s;ed on the &s;core of religion.</P>

<P>Her council being con&s;ulted on the &s;ituation of affairs, advi&s;ed her to forward the negotiation for a peace with France and Scotland; in the mean time to fortify the frontiers, equip a &s;trong fleet for the defence of the coa&s;t, and change the &s;heriffs and magi&s;trates, in &s;uch a manner that a majority of prote&s;tant members &s;hould be returned to the next parliament, which was ac|cordingly convoked for the twenty-fifth day of January. In the interim &s;he employed doctor Parker to reform in private the liturgy of Edward VI. then publi&s;hed a proclamation, allowing divine &s;ervice to be performed in the vul|gar tongue, and her &s;ubjects to read the Scriptures. In the beginning of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1559.</NOTE> year the marquis of Northampton, condemned in the late reign, was re&s;tored to his honours; Edward Seymour, &s;on of the duke of Somer&s;et, was created baron Beauchamp and earl of Hertford; Thomas Howard, &s;econd &s;on of the duke of Norfolk, was promoted to the honour of vi&s;count Howard of Bindon; her kin&s;man Henry Cary of Hun&s;don, and Oliver St. John of $word$ were elevated to the rank of barons. The&s;e promotions were &s;ucceeded by the

qu$en's coronation, which was performed in the church of We&s;tmin&s;ter. The ar$hbi&s;hop of York$ and &s;ome other prelates$ refu&s;ing to a&s;$$&s;t at the &s;olemnity, and the &s;ee of Canterbury being vacan$, the crown was placed upon he$ head by Oglethorpe bi&s;hop of Carlile.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; III.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was opened with a &s;peech by Nicholas Ba|con, keeper of the great &s;eal, who, after having &s;ound$d forth the prai&s;es of the new queen, and the mi&s;conduct of the la$$ mini&s;try: he gave the members to under&s;tand that it was the queen's plea&s;ure they &s;hould regulate the affairs of re|ligion; and$ in &s;o doing, chu&s;e a middle cour&s;e between t$e extremes of &s;uper&s;ti|tion and irreligion, that the nation might be re$united in one kind of wor&s;hip: he concluded his harrangue by repre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ities of the government, and recommending a &s;upply to her maje&s;ty. The commons, though they had been harra&s;&s;ed by impo&s;itions in the late reign, chearfully granted the tonnage and poundage, together with a large &s;ub&s;idy on funds and moveables. And for the &s;upport of the queen's royal e&s;tate, they pa&s;&s;ed a bill for re&s;toring the fir&s;t fruits and tythes to the crown; the revenue of which was likewi&s;e improved by the di&s;&s;olution of all the abbeys, nunneries, ho&s;pitals, and chantries, founded &s;ince the reign of Edward. On the fourth day of February, the commons had pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the queen, advi&s;ing her to marry, for the benefit of a quiet &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: and, in her reply, &s;he &s;aid &s;he was obliged to them for having forbore to mention any time or per&s;on; but that &s;he looked upon her&s;elf as married to her people; that &s;he had no inclination to alter her condition; and that &s;he &s;hould be very well plea&s;ed with the thoughts of their in&s;cribing on her tomb, "Here lies a queen, who lived and died a virgin." The parliament of England enacted a &s;tatute, recognizing Elizabeth to be the lawful &s;overeign, by virtue of the act pa&s;&s;ed in the thirty-fifth year of her father's reign. But the &s;entence of divorce between that king and Anne Bo|leyn was not rever&s;ed; nor the act which confirmed the &s;entence, repealed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> Then both hou&s;es converting their attention to the affairs of religion, pa&s;&s;ed &s;e|veral laws ordaining that &s;ervice &s;hould be performed in the vulgar tongue: That the &s;upremacy of the church of England &s;hould be vested in the &s;overeign: That all the acts relating to religion, which had pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of the la&s;t Edward, &s;hould be renewed and confirmed: That the nomination to bi&s;hoprics &s;hould be ve&s;ted in the queen, who might exerci&s;e her &s;upremacy by any per|&s;on<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> &s;he &s;hould think proper to appoint for that purpo&s;e: That all per&s;ons in office &s;hould take the oath of $upremacy; and that no per&s;on, under &s;evere penalties, &s;hould, by word or writing, &s;upport any foreign authority in this kingdom: That there &s;hould be an uniformity of wor&s;hip: That, on the va|cancy of any bi&s;hopric, the queen might re&s;ume its manours and temporal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, making a ju&s;t recompence to the &s;ee of per&s;onages impropriate. Elizabeth abu&s;ed this power, by &s;tripping the &s;ees of all their be&s;t manours, under the colour of giving equivalents in other impropriations. She was, by another act, put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all religious hou&s;es; and they pa&s;&s;ed a &s;tatute declaring that the condemnation of the Romi&s;h bi&s;hops, in the reign of Ed|ward VI. was both ju&s;t and lawful.</P>

<P>Elizabeth being ve&s;ted with the &s;upremacy, erected a tribunal called the High Commi&s;&s;ion-court, compo&s;ed of a certain number of commi&s;&s;ioners, who acted with the authority of the vicegerent appointed in the reign of the eighth Henry. Some eccle&s;ia&s;tics having preached again&s;t the reformation,
<PB N="5" REF="70">
the queen forbade all per&s;ons to preach without licence under the great &s;eal; and this prohibition irritated the lower hou&s;e of convocation to &s;uch a degree, that, in a petition to her maje&s;ty, they maintained the doctrines of the Roman church. They aftewards propo&s;ed a public di&s;pute between nine doctors of each party; but, when the di&s;putants a&s;&s;embled for this purpo&s;e, the Roman catholics declared they would not, without the pope's permi&s;&s;ion, di&s;pute upon points which were already decided. Of nine thou&s;and four hundred eccle|&s;ia&s;tics, who held benefices in England, tho&s;e who cho&s;e rather to renounce their livings than the Roman catholic religion, amounted to fourteen bi&s;hops, twelve archdeacons, fifteen heads of colleges, fifty canons, and about four|&s;core of the in&s;erior clergy: their places being filled with prote&s;tants, the church of England was entirely reformed. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>&sect; V.</HEAD>
<P>While the queen effected this &s;udden change in religion within her domi|nions, the plenipotentiaries of France and England continued their negotiation at Cateau in the Cambre&s;is; and the envoys of Philip II. who &s;till entertained &s;ome hope of e&s;pou&s;ing Elizabeth, in&s;i&s;ted upon Henry's re&s;toring Calais to the Engli&s;h: but, when he &s;aw the reformation e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, and met with a final repul&s;e from the queen, he abandoned her intere&s;t, and com|promi&s;ed his difference with the French monarch. Elizabeth, finding her&s;elf thus de&s;erted by the king of Spain, concluded a treaty with France, import|ing, that Henry &s;hould retain Calais, and the other places he had wre&s;ted from the Engli&s;h, for eight years; at the expiration of which they &s;hould be re&s;tored to the queen of England: That he &s;hould give &s;ecurity for paying to Elizabeth, or her &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the &s;um of five hundred thou&s;and golden crowns, in ca&s;e tho&s;e places &s;hould not be re&s;tored at the appointed time; and that, over and above this payment, Henry and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hould be obliged to re&s;tore Calais, and the other places, according to the &s;tipulations of the treaty: That the French king &s;hould give ho&s;tages for the performance of this article: That neither he, nor the king and queen of Scotland, nor Eliza|beth, &s;hould attempt any thing again&s;t each other, directly or indirectly, to the prejudice of this treaty: That the fortifications of Aymouth, and all others rai&s;ed in Scotland &s;ince the treaty of Boulogne, &s;hould be demoli&s;hed: That all the other preten&s;ions of the contracting parties, &s;hould remain in full force, until all differences could be amicably compromi&s;ed: And that they &s;hould not encourage or protect the rebellious &s;ubjects of each other. At the &s;ame time a &s;eparate treaty of peace, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, was concluded between the queens of England and Scotland, and ratified by Mary, and her husband Francis the dauphin.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VI.</HEAD>
<P>Henry would not have granted &s;uch favourable terms to Elizabeth, had he intended to ob&s;erve the articles of the treaty: but his &s;ole de&s;ign in con&s;enting to this peace, was to humour Philip, who, from a notion of punc|tilio, would not ratify his own peace with France, until he had mediated a treaty between the French king and Elizabeth. Not that he pre&s;erved the lea&s;t regard to the intere&s;t of England, or de&s;ired that Henry &s;hould adhere to the articles of the peace; but he thought his honour required that he &s;hould ef|fect an apparent accommodation in favour of his ally. Immediately after the peace of Cateau, the dauphin and his con&s;ort Mary queen of Scots, a&s;&s;umed the title of king and queen of Scotland, England, and Ireland; and cau&s;ed the arms of England to be engraved on their &s;eals and plate. Sir Nicholas <NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE>
<PB N="6" REF="80">
Throgmorton, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, complaining of this in&s;ult, received a very frivolous an&s;wer; and he repeating his remon&s;trance, the French mini&s;try told him, the king and queen of Scotland had as good a right to a&s;&s;ume the arms of England, as Elizabeth had to arrogate the title of queen of France. Though the con&s;table of Montmorency, who hated the Gui&s;e fac|tion, prevailed upon Henry to lay a&s;ide this di&s;tinction, Elizabeth, from this period, con&s;idered Mary as a formidable rival, and the princes of Lorraine as her mortal enemies. Certain it is, they endeavoured to rai&s;e their niece Mary to the throne of England; and per&s;uaded the French king, that through her means he would in time be able to unite all England and Ireland under his dominion.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VII.</HEAD>
<P>This va&s;t project flattered the ambition of Henry; and, as a prepa|ratory &s;tep, he endeavoured to render his &s;on ab&s;olute in Scotland. The queen regent of that country was very well di&s;po&s;ed to concur with his mea&s;ures: but the attachment of her brother the cardinal to the Roman catholic religion, and her own bia&s;s to tho&s;e principles, defeated their &s;cheme. The reformation had made great progre&s;s in Scotland, under the au&s;pices of John Knox, and others, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the fanatical &s;pirit of Calvin; and the French mini&s;try concluded that they &s;hould never be able to carry their point, until they had totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e religious republicans who would never join in favour of a Roman catholic prince, again&s;t Elizabeth, who was a profe&s;&s;ed prote&s;tant. Henry II. at the in&s;tigation of the Gui&s;es, directed the queen-regent of Scot|land to &s;uppre&s;s the prote&s;tants; and &s;he publi&s;hed an edict for that purpo&s;e, which involved the whole kingdom in confu&s;ion. Not contented with this &s;tep, &s;he convoked the e&s;tates at Stirling, and proceeded &s;o &s;everely again&s;t &s;ome mini&s;ters of the reformed religion, that Knox and his a&s;&s;ociates openly preached again&s;t the catholic doctrine. He inflamed the people of Perth to &s;uch a de|gree, by his remon&s;trances, that they pillaged the churches, burned the images and ornaments, and de&s;troyed the mona&s;tery of the Carthu&s;ians. The regent, incen&s;ed at the&s;e proceedings, a&s;&s;embled &s;ome troops, by means of the earls of Argyle and Athole, and began her march for Perth; but under&s;tand|ing that the earl of Glencairn, with &s;everal other noblemen, were encamped in the neighbourhood of that place, with a view to oppo&s;e her progre&s;s, &s;he pro|po&s;ed terms of accommodation; and the peace was concluded, on condition that the di&s;putes about religion &s;hould be referred to the determination of par|liament. The confederates had no &s;ooner di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their troops, than &s;he re|e&s;tabli&s;hed the ma&s;s at Perth, and &s;ecured the town with a &s;trong garri&s;on. It was on this occa&s;ion that the earl of Argyle, and James Stuart prior of St. Andrew's, natural &s;on of James V. declared again&s;t the regent, and joined the prote&s;tant party. While they were employed in levying forces, the inhabi|tants of Cupar, St. Andrew's, and &s;everal other towns, publicly renounced the Roman catholic religion, and committed the mo&s;t barbarous exce&s;&s;es again&s;t the churches and convents, &s;acrificing every thing they contained, not even ex|cepting the archives, in which the mo&s;t material tran&s;actions of their nation were recorded. The confederates a&s;&s;embling another army, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Perth, Scone, Stirling, and Linhthgow; and their forces daily increa&s;ing, the queen-regent, and D'Oy&s;el, who commanded two thou&s;and French auxili|aries, retired with precipitation to Dunbar. Religion was the pretence which covered all the&s;e commotions; and, in fact, the motive which animated the
<PB N="7" REF="90">
people: but the chief actors were influenced by far other con&s;iderations. The French king wanted to cru&s;h the prote&s;tants, becau&s;e they were attached to queen Elizabeth, whom he de&s;igned to dethrone. She$ on the other hand, perceiving his drift, &s;upported the reformers in Scotland, that they might em|ploy all the forces he could &s;end into that kingdom. The Scotti&s;h nobles de|clared for the prote&s;tant religion, in hope of one day enjoying the lands of the church; and James Stuart, prior of St. Andrew's, is &s;aid to have thrown him|&s;elf into the &s;ame &s;cale, that he might, on the ruin of his &s;i&s;ter Mary, a&s;cend the throne of Scotland. The reformed clergy were generally wrong-headed fanatics, employed by more de&s;igning heads to kindle a &s;pirit of madne&s;s and enthu&s;ia&s;m, which they converted to the purpo&s;es of their own intere&s;t. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil.</NOTE></P>

<P>Such was the &s;ituation of affairs in Scotland, when Henry II. of France being accidentally &s;lain in a tournament, the crown of that kingdom devolved upon his &s;on Francis I. who had married the queen of Scotland; and her uncles engro&s;&s;ed the whole admini&s;tration. They forthwith &s;ent a rein|forcement<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> of three thou&s;and men, under La Bro&s;&s;e, to the queen-regent, who now compelled the confederates to retire in their turn, and harra&s;&s;ed them in &s;uch a manner, that they had recour&s;e to queen Elizabeth, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they &s;ollicited in an addre&s;s, which was pre&s;ented to her by William Maitland of Lidington, lord &s;ecretary of Scotland. Cecil, who was the queen's chief coun&s;ellor, employed Henry Piercy as an agent with the Scotti&s;h confederates, who &s;tiled them&s;elves the congregation; and they canted in &s;uch a manner about the go&s;pel, and the extirpation of idolatry, that Elizabeth believed they were all hypocrites at bottom. Neverthele&s;s, it was &s;o much her intere&s;t to prevent the French from getting footing in Scotland, that &s;he di&s;&s;embled her &s;entiments, and promi&s;ed to &s;upport them again&s;t the enemies of the true reli|gion. Sir Ralph Sadler was &s;ent to confer with Piercy concerning the defence of the Marches; and proper directions were communicated to Sir James Crofts, governor of Berwick. The duke of Norfolk was appointed lord lieutenant of the northern counties; William lord Gray con&s;tituted warden of the Middle and Ea&s;t Marches; Thomas earl of Su&s;&s;ex &s;ent back as lord lieutenant of Ire|land, which he had formerly governed with great conduct and moderation; and William Winton, ma&s;ter of the naval &s;tores, was promoted to the com|mand of a &s;quadron, with which he &s;ailed into the Frith of Forth, de&s;troyed &s;everal French &s;hips of war, and annoyed the forces of that kingdom, which were in garri&s;on in the i&s;le of Inchkeith. While Elizabeth took the&s;e mea&s;ures<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.</NOTE> for &s;upporting the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Scotland, Philip II. of Spain began to execute a re&s;olution he had formed, to exterminate that religion from the Low-Countries, which he meaned to en&s;lave. He &s;ecured the principal towns with Spani&s;h garri&s;ons, contrary to the privileges of the country. When he &s;et out for Spain, he left the government in the hands of his aunt, Margaret dutche&s;s of Parma, &s;o as to excite the re&s;entment of the prince of Orange, and the count of Egmont, who a&s;pired to that dignity: but they were &s;till more incen&s;ed at his leaving as her chief coun&s;ellor the cardinal of Granville, their profe&s;&s;ed enemy, whom they con&s;idered as the author of the &s;cheme for en&s;laving their country. In the cour&s;e of this year, pope Paul IV. dying, was &s;ucceeded by cardinal Angelo de Medicis, who a&s;&s;umed the name of Pius IV. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Grotius.</NOTE></P>

<P>The &s;ituation of Elizabeth at this juncture was extremely perplexing and precarious. The pope and the French king were her profe&s;&s;ed enemies.
<PB N="8" REF="100">
Mary of Scotland claimed her crown by a title which many of the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects privately recognized. Philip of Spain had conceived an antipathy to her, from the repul&s;e he &s;u&s;tained at her hands, and the alteration &s;he made in the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of her country: the Iri&s;h were arrogant, ferocious, and blindly devoted to the papal authority; and all the catholics in England were aver&s;e to her dominion. In this emergency, &s;he laid down two maxims, from which &s;he never &s;werved through the whole cour&s;e of her reign. The fir&s;t was to conciliate the affection of her people; and the other to find work for her enemies in their own dominions. She was endowed with a great &s;hare of natural penetration$ &s;he had ob&s;erved the characters of mankind. Know|ing how to di&s;tingui&s;h merit, &s;he made choice of able mini&s;ters: &s;he admini|&s;tred ju&s;tice impartially, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons: &s;he regulated her expence with &s;uch occonomy as could not but be agreeable to her &s;ubjects, who had been fleeced under the preceding reigns; and having been accu&s;tomed to di&s;|&s;imulation, &s;he not only a&s;&s;umed the utmo&s;t complacency in her deportment, but affected &s;uch an ardour of love and regard for her &s;ubjects, as could not fail to produce the warme&s;t return of confidence and affection. Her frugality was not &s;o much the effect of her natural di&s;po&s;ition, as the re&s;ult of good &s;en&s;e and deliberate reflexion; for, when &s;he thought the intere&s;t of her king|dom was at &s;take, &s;he di&s;tributed her wealth with uncommon liberality, in fo|menting the troubles of France, Scotland, and the Low-Countries, to employ her foes in &s;uch a manner as would prevent them from uniting for her de|&s;truction.</P>

<P>Influenced by the&s;e principles, Elizabeth under&s;tanding that the princes of Gui&s;e were employed in making great preparations for &s;ending an army into Scotland, concluded a treaty with the earl of Arran, Duc de Chateleraud, and the re&s;t of the Scotti&s;h confederates, whom &s;he promi&s;ed to &s;upport again&s;t the French forces, which &s;till continued to pur&s;ue them among their mountains and mora&s;&s;es. Martigues had arrived from France, with a fre&s;h reinforcement, and a very con&s;iderable armament was daily expected, under the command of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1$60.</NOTE> the marquis D'Elbeuf: but his fleet being di&s;per&s;ed in a &s;torm, he was obliged to return and refit; and dome&s;tic troubles intervening in France, the troops were converted to another purpo&s;e. The French forces in Scotland, after their expedition again&s;t the lords of the Congregation, returned to Leith, which they had fortified; and the confederates marched towards Haddington, to join the Engli&s;h army under the lord Gray, amounting to eight thou&s;and men. In the mean time the queen-regent, afraid of being &s;hut up in Leith, retired to Edinburgh-ca&s;tle, where &s;he was honourably received by Er&s;kine, the go|vernor; though he &s;till retained in his own hands the command of the fortre&s;s. Lord Gray, being reinforced by the Scotti&s;h malecontents, re&s;olved to un|dertake the &s;iege of Leith; which was accordingly inve&s;ted. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the French king &s;ent Monluc, bi&s;hop of Valence, as his amba&s;&s;a|dor to England, with in&s;tructions to de&s;ire Elizabeth would recall her troops from Scotland. And this prelate even propo&s;ed to re&s;tore Calais, if &s;he would<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> comply with the reque&s;t. To this emba&s;&s;y the French king added De Scure, who joined Monluc in pre&s;&s;ing her upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. She &s;aid &s;he was ready to withdraw her troops from Scotland, provided Francis would recall tho&s;e he had &s;ent thither: but, in the mean time, &s;he declared &s;he would not put a

poor fi&s;hing-town, &s;uch as Calais, in competition with the &s;afety of her king|dom. The &s;iege of Leith was &s;till carried on by the Engli&s;h, though they made but little progre&s;s again&s;t &s;uch a numerous and gallant garri&s;on.</P>

<P>At length the duke of Norfolk arrived in the camp of the be&s;iegers with a new reinforcement; notwith&s;tanding which, they would have found it a difficult ta&s;k to reduce the place, had not the con&s;piracy of Amboi&s;e been detected in France; and the princes of Lorraine found it nece&s;&s;ary to recall their troops from Scotland. Monluc and the count of Randan were &s;ent thither with full powers to conclude a treaty with Elizabeth and the malecontents. Secretary Cecil and doctor Wotton were appointed plenipotentiaries for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> Engli&s;h. The conferences were begun at Edinburgh; and, in the mean time, both parties agreed to a truce, during which the queen-regent died in the ca&s;tle. The French plenipotentiaries refu&s;ed at fir&s;t to treat with the Scotti&s;h confederates, alledging they were in a &s;tate of rebellion: but an ex|pedient was found to remove this objection. Namely, that Francis and Mary &s;hould make &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions to the confederates, purely as the effects of their royal grace and favour; but that the&s;e &s;hould be neverthele&s;s confirmed in the treaty with the queen of England. They agreed that the French troops &s;hould in twenty days be reconveyed to their own country in Engli&s;h bottoms: That Leith &s;hould be evacuated, and its fortifications demoli&s;hed: That the works rai&s;ed by the French at Dunbar &s;hould be di&s;mantled: And that the king and queen of Scotland &s;hould grant an amne&s;ty in favour of the confederates, to be confirmed by the parliament of Scotland. The French, however, were<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE> at liberty to leave &s;ixty men in the i&s;le of Inchkeith. The treaty with Eliza|beth imported, That for the future the king and queen of Scotland &s;hould re|frain from a&s;&s;uming the title and arms belonging to the &s;overeign of England and Ireland: That the acts or patents which they had expedited under that title, &s;hould be altered or annulled: That a conference &s;hould be held in Eng|land, between the commi&s;&s;ioners of the two crowns, in order to determine what further &s;atisfaction was due to the queen of England: That, if they could not agree on this &s;ubject, the difference &s;hould be referred to the deci&s;ion of the king of Spain: And that the king and queen of France and Scotland &s;hould be obliged to confirm the conce&s;&s;ions which had been made by the French pleni|potentiaries to the Scotti&s;h confederates. After the conclu&s;ion of the treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> the French and Engli&s;h retired from Scotland; the works of Leith and Dun|bar were demoli&s;hed; and the amne&s;ty was confirmed by the e&s;tates of Scot|land, which enacted divers laws in favour of the reformation. Though Fran|cis and Mary confirmed the&s;e laws, they refu&s;ed to ratify the treaty with Eliza|beth, on pretence that &s;he had treated with their rebellious &s;ubjects, as if they had formed an independent &s;tate: but the real de&s;ign of the princes of Lor|raine was to wre&s;t the crown of England out of the hands of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Elizabeth was well aware of their intention, for which &s;he, in the &s;equel, wreaked her revenge upon their niece, the unfortunate queen of Scotland.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the queen's declaration touching her re&s;olution to live unmarried, people in general believed her &s;entiments on that &s;ubject would change; and not only &s;overeign princes, but even &s;ome of her own &s;ubjects, a&s;pired to the honour of a matrimonial crown. Charles archduke of Au&s;tria, &s;econd &s;on of the emperor Ferdinand, the king of Sweden, and the duke of Hol&s;tein, were numbered among tho&s;e who demanded her in marriage.
<PB N="10" REF="120">
The earl of Arran, &s;on to the duke of Chateleraud, pre&s;umptive heir to the crown of Scotland, &s;lattered him&s;elf that Elizabeth would prefer him to all $$s competitors, from a pro&s;pect of uniting the two kingdoms. The earl of Arundel tru&s;ting to his noble birth and ancient lineage, entertained hopes of e&s;pou&s;ing his &s;overeign. Sir George Pickering having received &s;ome particu|lar marks of her e&s;teem, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with the notion of having captivated her affection$ but, of all the courtiers, lord Robert Dudley$ &s;on of the late duke of Northumberland, enjoyed the greate&s;t &s;hare of her favour. At her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, &s;he appointed him ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e; and he was admitted into the order of the Garter. She &s;eemed to take plea&s;ure in di&s;tri|buting her favours through the canal of this nobleman, who was di&s;tingui&s;hed at court by the appellation of My Lord, as if he alone was worthy of that title. He was made acquainted with all the &s;ecrets of &s;tate affairs. The amba&s;&s;adors reported the &s;ucce&s;s of their negotiations to him as to their &s;ove|reign; and to him all &s;ollicitations were addre&s;&s;ed. In a word, it plainly ap|peared that Elizabeth felt &s;omething more than bare e&s;teem for Dudley, who&s;e character by no means ju&s;tified her favour. He inherited all his father's vices, and had nothing but per&s;onal accompli&s;hments to recommend him to a lady<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burleigh$$ Pa|pers.</NOTE> of Elizabeth's penetration. Neverthele&s;s, her behaviour with regard to him was &s;uch as afforded &s;ubject for the mo&s;t &s;candalous in&s;inuations to the preju|dice of her reputation; and he was &s;aid to have poi&s;oned his own wife, that he might be at liberty to wed his &s;overeign. Be&s;ides Dudley, &s;he had two other favourites of another kind, namely, Nicholas Bacon, keeper of the great $eal; and William Cecil her &s;ecretary, a mini&s;ter of con&s;ummate judgment, exten&s;ive knowledge, indefatigable, impenetrable, and implicitely attached to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> the intere&s;t of his &s;overeign.</P>

<P>Elizabeth found her&s;elf the more nece&s;&s;itated to employ able mini|&s;ters at home, as &s;he had &s;carce an ally abroad upon whom &s;he could place the lea&s;t dependance. Montague, whom &s;he had &s;ent as her amba&s;&s;ador to Philip, met with a very cold reception. That prince bewailed the alteration which had been made in religion within the queen's dominions; re&s;tored the collar of the order of the Garter, which he would no longer retain, and declined re|newing the alliance with England. The pope &s;ent Vincent Parpaglia, abbot of St. Sauveur, with in&s;tructions, and a brief to queen Elizabeth, exhorting her to return within the pale of the church; promi&s;ing that a general council &s;hould be convoked with all convenient expedition. The nuncio is &s;aid to have promi&s;ed that the pope would annul the &s;entence of divorce be|tween Henry VIII. and Anne Boleyn, confirm the Engli&s;h liturgy, and allow the people to communicate in both &s;pecies at the &s;acrament. But all tho&s;e of|fers were rejected, becau&s;e the queen had no opinion of the pope's &s;incerity. While the prote&s;tants in England enjoyed liberty of con&s;cience, and the mo&s;t agreeable repo&s;e, the Calvini&s;ts in France were per&s;ecuted without mercy, un|til they formed a con&s;piracy again&s;t the duke of Gui&s;e and the cardinal of Lorrain, who were their profe&s;&s;ed enemies. The prince of Cond&eacute; was &s;aid to favour them in private; and a gentleman called La Renaudie laid a &s;cheme for carrying off the duke and the cardinal from the court at Amboi&s;e. This de&s;ign being di&s;covered, was interpreted into a con&s;piracy again&s;t the king, and twelve hundred per&s;ons were put to death, for having been concerned in the contrivance. The e&s;tates of the kingdom being convoked at Orleans, the
<PB N="11" REF="130">
king of Navarre, and the prince of Cond&eacute;, went thither; though they knew them&s;elves &s;u&s;pected and hated by the princes of Lorraine. The fir&s;t was &s;o<NOTE PLACE="marg">Me$erai.</NOTE> narrowly watched that he could not e&s;cape; the other was impri&s;oned, and afterwards condemned to lo&s;e his life by the hands of the common executioner: but the death of Francis II. &s;aved him from that ignominious fate. This event produced a total revolution in the politics of the French court. Charles IX. who &s;ucceeded his brother Francis, being &s;till a minor, his mother, Ca|therine de Medicis, a&s;&s;umed the regency, with the con&s;ent of the king of Na|varre, who, as fir&s;t prince of the blood, was intitled to that office. In order to maintain her power &s;he fomented the factions. The catholics were headed by the duke of Gui&s;e, the con&s;table of Montmorency, and the marechal de St. Andre: the chiefs of the Huguenots or prote&s;tants, were the prince of Cond&eacute;, the admiral de Coligny, and his brother D'Andelot; and the king of Navarre fluctuated between the two parties. The princes of Gui&s;e having occa&s;ion for all their power, to &s;upport their intere&s;t at home, laid a&s;ide all thoughts of the &s;cheme they had formerly projected in favour of their niece Mary of Scotland, who, finding her&s;elf &s;lighted by her mother-in-law, re|&s;olved to return to her native land; and, in the mean time, quitted the title of queen of England, which &s;he had hitherto a&s;&s;umed &s;ince the treaty of Cateau.</P>

<P>Elizabeth mean while employed her attention in making nece&s;&s;ary regulations for the welfare of her people. She i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, com|manding anabapti&s;ts and heretics to quit the kingdom in twenty days, on pain of impri&s;onment, and forfeiture of goods and chattels. She publi&s;hed another again&s;t tho&s;e &s;acrilegious per&s;ons who, under colour of aboli&s;hing &s;uper&s;tition, defaced ancient monuments and epitaphs, and robbed churches of bells, leaden roofs, and other appurtenances. She converted We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey into a collegiate church; and the coin, which had been deba&s;ed in the reign of her father, &s;he now reduced to its intrin&s;ic value. Shan O'Neal, an Iri&s;h noble|man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> rai&s;ing a rebellion in that kingdom, a body of forces was &s;ent over to reduce him. After &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes, finding him&s;elf unable to cope with the government, he laid down his arms, by the advice of his kin&s;man the earl of Kildare, and &s;ubmitted to the queen's mercy. Elizabeth was no &s;ooner<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This demand, however, Mary eluded, by &s;aying, that as &s;he was altogether without advi&s;ers, &s;he would wait the arrival of &s;ome Scotti&s;h noblemen, whom &s;he expected in France; and, with their concurrence, give &s;atisfaction to the queen of England.</P>

<P>In the interim, that prince&s;s quitted the court of France, and retired<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil's Me|moirs.</NOTE> to Rheims, where &s;he &s;pent part of the winter with her uncle the cardinal. There &s;he was vi&s;ited by Martigues, La Bro&s;&s;e, and D'Oy&s;el, on their return from Scotland, who advi&s;ed her to conciliate the affection of her ba&s;tard|brother James Stuart prior of St. Andrew's, the earl of Argyle, &s;ecretary Lidington, and the laird of Grange; and to confide in her prote&s;tant &s;ubjects, who were much more numerous and powerful than the catholics. On the other hand, John Le&s;ley, afterwards bi&s;hop of Roffe, to whom &s;he granted an audience in her journey to Nancy, gave her to under&s;tand that he was com|mi&s;&s;ioned
<PB N="12" REF="140">
by the catholics of Scotland, to a&s;&s;ure her that &s;he would find them ready to ri&s;e in a body under her royal banner, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h the ancient re|ligion by force of arms: they therefore intreated her to repair to Abenleen with all convenient &s;peed$ and to di&s;tru&s;t the prior of St. Andrew's, who&s;e ambition a&s;pired at the throne &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Next day &s;he was at Joinville vi&s;ited by the pr$$r, who had gone over to France to pre&s;$nt his re&s;pects to his &s;overeign. He confirmed her in the re&s;olution to return to her native kingdom, and found means to ingratiate him&s;elf with her to &s;uch a degree, that &s;he empowered him by patent to a&s;&s;emble the &s;tates, that they might pa&s;s<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bucharan.</NOTE> &s;uch acts as &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the kingdom. He forthwith returned to Scotland$ then convoking the parliament, the reforma|tion was e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, and all the mona&s;teries were demoli&s;hed. Mary being re&s;olved upon her voyage, di&s;patched D'Oy&s;el to queen Elizabeth, to &s;ollicit a &s;afe-conduct, which was refu&s;ed, except on condition that the queen of Scots &s;hould previou&s;ly ratify the treaty of Edinburgh. This refu&s;al was deeply re&s;ented by Mary, who complained to Throgmorton, the Engli&s;h am|ba&s;&s;ador, that Elizabeth, not contented with having &s;upported her rebellious &s;ubjects, wanted to hinder her from returning to her own dominions; an in|&s;ult which &s;he had no rea&s;on to expect from any crowned head, much le&s;s from one to whom &s;he was no nearly related. With re&s;pect to the treaty of Edin|burgh, &s;he &s;aid it had been concluded during the life of her hu&s;band; and if he refu&s;ed to ratify it, the fault ought to be imputed to him only; that &s;ince &s;he had been a window, the council of France did not chu&s;e to intermeddle in the affairs of Scotland; and that the Scotti&s;h &s;ubjects who attended her were private per&s;ons, whom &s;he neither could nor would con&s;ult in an affair of &s;uch importance.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XVI.</HEAD>
<P>Although &s;he had rea&s;on to believe that Elizabeth would endeavour to intercept her at &s;ea, &s;he ventured to &s;et &s;ail for Scotland, where, though &s;he arrived in &s;afety, amid&s;t the acclammations of her people, &s;he had the mortifi|cation to &s;ee &s;uch &s;evere laws in force again&s;t her religion, that it was with difficulty &s;he her&s;elf was permitted to celebrate the ma&s;s in her own private chapel. There was nothing liberal, generous, or di&s;intere&s;ted, in the fir&s;t Scotti&s;h reformers. They were actuated by a gothic &s;pirit of ignorant fanati|ci&s;m, which they had imbibed from Calvin, and the apo&s;tles of Geneva. Among the noblemen of Scotland, the earls of Huntley, Athol, Crawford, and Sutherland, &s;till adhered to the old religion; and the duke of Chateleraud &s;eemed quite neutral. The Roman catholic lords and prelates did not doubt but that, with the countenance and protection of the queen, they &s;hould be enabled to re&s;tore the papal authority. As a previous &s;tep to this event, they endeavoured to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s their &s;overeign with a bad opinion of her natural brother James Stuart, to whom &s;he had in a great mea&s;ure committed the ad|mini&s;tration of her affairs. In the mean time, Mary had been in&s;tructed by her uncles to cultivate a friend&s;hip with Elizabeth, in hope of prevailing upon that prince&s;s to declare her the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown of England. Accordingly Mary di&s;patched Maitland as her amba&s;&s;ador, to inform her &s;i&s;ter queen of her happy arrival in her own dominions, and &s;ollicit the friend&s;hip of Elizabeth. He likewi&s;e delivered a letter, &s;ub&s;cribed by the principal noblemen of Scotland, who, after a profu&s;ion of compliment, advi&s;ed the queen of England to de|clare
<PB N="13" REF="150">
her cou&s;in Mary her pre&s;umptive heir; a declaration that would produce a perfectly good under&s;tanding between the two nations. Elizabeth expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urprize that the queen of Scotland had not ratified the treaty of Edin|burgh &s;ince her arrival; but &s;he admitted the excu&s;e of the amba&s;&s;ador, who told her that Mary had not yet found lei&s;ure to deliberate upon a matter of &s;uch importance. With re&s;pect to the letter &s;he had received from the Scotti&s;h<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotiations of Wal&s;ing|ham.</NOTE> lords, &s;he flatly refu&s;ed to make any declaration that would expo&s;e her to the ri&s;que of &s;eeing her &s;ubjects adore the ri&s;ing &s;un. She &s;aid &s;he had no inten|tion to deprive the queen of Scotland of her right; but that &s;he would not allow her to pluck the crown from her head; and expected, in the mean time, that Mary would make proper &s;atisfaction for having u&s;urped her arms and title. Neverthele&s;s, &s;he agreed to maintain a corre&s;pondence with her; and many letters pa&s;&s;ed between them, filled with profe&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t unre|&s;erved friend&s;hip, while they hated each other in their hearts, with all the rage of jealou&s;y and di&s;dain. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil's Me|moirs.</NOTE></P>

<P>The pope, notwith&s;tanding the an&s;wer which had been made to Par|paglia, appointed the abbot Martinengo his nuncio in England, to go thither and notify to Elizabeth that the council of Trent would be continued, and de&s;ire that &s;he would &s;end &s;ome Engli&s;h bi&s;hops to that a&s;&s;embly. The queen forbidding the abbot to enter her dominions, her amba&s;&s;ador Throgmorton was de&s;ired by the nuncio at Paris, to communicate this intimation to his &s;overeign; who an&s;wered, that &s;he had no bu&s;ine&s;s with the pope; that &s;he wi&s;hed with all her heart to &s;ee an oecumenical council a&s;&s;embled: but that &s;he would never acknowledge a council convoked by the bi&s;hop of Rome, who had no more power than any other bi&s;hop. She was utterly de&s;titute of allies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> and had rea&s;on to dread every thing from the enmity of Philip, who, now that Francis II. was dead, made no &s;cruple of avowing his animo&s;ity, excited partly by the repul&s;e he had &s;u&s;tained when he demanded her in marriage, and partly by his re&s;entment for her having &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the catholic religion. He &s;ollicited the pope to denounce the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t her; he treated her amba&s;&s;adors with contempt, and allowed the officers of the inqui&s;ition to per&s;ecute the Engli&s;h traders in his Spani&s;h dominions. Elizabeth expected a &s;torm from that quarter. She doubted the &s;incerity of the Scotti&s;h queen, who &s;till eluded the ratification of the treaty, and carried on a corre&s;pondence with the catholics of England: it was therefore time to take the wi&s;e&s;t precautions for the defence of her crown and dignity. She equipped a noble fleet, which &s;ecured the empire of the &s;ea; &s;he erected forts for the protection of her harbours; &s;he aug|mented the garri&s;ons, and &s;trengthened the fortifications of Berwick; &s;he trained the national militia to the exerci&s;e of arms; &s;he encouraged trade and manu|facture, reformed the oeconomy of her hou&s;hold, and won the favour of her &s;ubjects, by avoiding demands of &s;ub&s;idies, and admini&s;tring ju&s;tice with the utmo&s;t impartiality.</P>

<P>It was not without rea&s;on that &s;he exerted her endeavours in this<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1562.</NOTE> manner. The catholics began to cabal in private, and form &s;chemes for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of their religion. The queen found upon inquiry that Mary of Scotland maintained a corre&s;pondence with the malecontents, and that the earl and counte&s;s of Lennox had &s;ome &s;ecret communication with the queen of Scots; and therefore committed them clo&s;e pri&s;oners to the Tower of London.

She afterwards di&s;covered that Arthur Pole, nephew to the late cardinal, with his brother Edmund, and Anthony Forte&s;cue, had engaged in a con&s;piracy again&s;t the government: that their intention was to repair to France, where the Gui&s;es promi&s;ed to &s;upply them with five thou&s;and men, to be tran&s;ported into Wales; and there they de&s;igned to proclaim Mary queen of Scotland, while Arthur Pole &s;hould be declared duke of Clarence. They were imme|diately arre&s;ted, with their accomplices, and confe&s;&s;ed they had formed &s;uch a &s;cheme; but prote&s;ted they had no de&s;ign to put it in execution before the death of queen Elizabeth, which, from the prediction of two pretended a&s;trologers, they believed would happen in the &s;pring. They were upon their own confe&s;&s;ion condemned; but the queen pardoned them, in con&s;ideration of their illu&s;trious origin. She did not manife&s;t the &s;ame clemency towards Ca|therine Gray, daughter of the duke of Suffolk, and &s;i&s;ter to lady Jane, who had been beheaded in the preceding reign. This lady having been married to the earl of Pembroke, and divorced from him for political rea&s;ons, afterwards e&s;pou&s;ed in private the earl of Hertford, who went to France upon his travels, after the marriage, which was di&s;covered by Catherine's pregnancy. Eliza|beth, who looked upon this lady as a rival in her title to the throne, was &s;o incen&s;ed when &s;he heard of her condition, that &s;he &s;ent her pri&s;oner to the Tower, whither al&s;o her hu&s;band was committed when he returned to Eng|land. As he could not prove his marriage by legal evidence, it was annulled<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$mden.</NOTE> by a &s;entence of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. Neverthele&s;s, the earl found means to vi&s;it Catherine after her delivery; and &s;he conceived again. Then he was accu&s;ed and convicted of having e&s;caped from pri&s;on, corrupted a prince&s;s of the blood, and cohabited with a woman from whom he had been &s;epa|rated by a legal proce&s;s. He was fined in five thou&s;and pounds; and, after a long confinement, obliged to relinqui&s;h Catherine by a formal deed: but the queen never could forgive his wife, who died in pri&s;on.</P>

<P>She had a much more formidable competitor in the per&s;on of Mary, who&s;e uncles, of the hou&s;e of Gui&s;e, now began to renew their old &s;cheme in her favour. They had engaged the king of Navarre, and the con&s;table Montmo|rency, in their intere&s;t: they detained the king and the queen-mother in cap|tivity: they covered their de&s;igns with the pretext of religion, and even ma&s;|&s;acred the Huguenots at Va&s;&s;y. The queen-regent had written to the prince of Cond&eacute;, conjuring him to a&s;&s;i&s;t her and the king in their di&s;tre&s;s; and that prince, putting him&s;elf at the head of the prote&s;tants, &s;urprized Orleans. A civil war immediately commenced, and the Huguenots being &s;everely handled in the fir&s;t campaign, deputed the vidame of Chartres to implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Elizabeth. She was glad of an opportunity to foment the divi&s;ions of France, for her own pre&s;ervation; and forthwith concluded a treaty, by which &s;he engaged to furni&s;h the Huguenots with one hundred thou&s;and crowns in money, and &s;ix thou&s;and foot &s;oldiers, for the defence of Dieppe, Rouen, and Havre de Grace, which la&s;t place &s;he intended to keep, until Calais &s;hould be re&s;tored, according to the &s;tipulation in the treaty of Cateau and Cambre&s;is.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> Paul de Foix, amba&s;&s;ador of France at the Engli&s;h court, demanded that the vidame and all his attendants &s;hould be delivered into his hands, as traitors to their country; but Elizabeth rejected his reque&s;t. In September, the earl of Warwick was &s;ent to Normandy with the promi&s;ed reinforcement; and Rouen
<PB N="15" REF="170">
being at that time be&s;ieged by the king of Navarre, he divided them between Dieppe and Havre de Grace, of which the queen had appointed him gover|nor. Rouen was taken by a&s;&s;ault, in which the king of Navarre was mortally wounded. The prince of Cond&eacute; having received another reinforcement from the prote&s;tant princes of Germany, advanced to the neighbourhood of Paris, where he was amu&s;ed by the Gui&s;es with a negotiation, until the city was ren|dered defen&s;ible, and fortified too &s;trongly for him to attempt the &s;iege; &s;o that he retired towards Normandy, whither the enemy attended his motions. Immediately after Cond&eacute;'s departure from the neighbourhood of Paris, war was proclaimed in that city again&s;t Elizabeth; but the king, and queen-regent who was by this time reconciled to the Gui&s;es and the con&s;table, finding them|&s;elves unprepared for ho&s;tilities, di&s;owned the proclamation; and Elizabeth was &s;atisfied with a letter from the king on that &s;ubject. Yet, on this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forbes.</NOTE> occa&s;ion, &s;he acted contrary to the advice of Sir Thomas Smith, and Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, who exhorted her to &s;eize this opportunity of re|covering Calais, the fortifications of which were in a ruinous condition, and the place almo&s;t de&s;titute of a garri&s;on. In the latter end of the year a battle was fought at Dreux, between the catholics and Huguenots, with doubtful &s;ucce&s;s. In the beginning of the action, the con&s;table Montmorency fell into<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> the hands of the prote&s;tants, who conveyed him to Orleans; but afterwards the prince of Cond&eacute;, being de&s;erted by the German auxiliaries, was taken by M.

<P>Elizabeth was ju&s;t recovered of the &s;mall pox, when the parliament<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1563.</NOTE> meeting in January, petitioned, in an addre&s;s, that &s;he would alter her condi|tion, and &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in order to avoid the calamities which a com|petition might produce. She did not chu&s;e to declare her &s;entiments with regard to marriage; but a&s;&s;ured them that, before her death, &s;he would pro+vide for the &s;afety of the nation. Several laws were made for the relief of the poor, and the encouragement of commerce and agriculture; and the parliament indulged her with an entire &s;ub&s;idy, and two fifteenths, for enabling her to coun|ter-work the efforts of her enemies. The convocation likewi&s;e granted a &s;ub&s;idy of &s;ix &s;hillings in the pound, and drew up a confe&s;&s;ion of faith in thirty-nine articles, as an improvement upon tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed in the reign of the &s;ixth Edward. While Elizabeth thus regulated her dome&s;tic affairs, the duke of Gui&s;e inve&s;ted Orleans, which was defended by D'Andelet, brother of the ad|miral, who marched into Normandy with the Huguenot army, to make a di|ver&s;ion in &s;avour of the be&s;ieged, and receive &s;upplies of men and money which he expected from the queen of England. Orleans was almo&s;t reduced to extremity, when the duke of Gui&s;e was mortally wounded with a pi&s;tol bul|let, by a young gentleman called Poltrot. The duke finding his end ap|proaching, expre&s;&s;ed a deep-felt remor&s;e at the remembrance of his having excited a civil war, and exhorted the queen-regent to conclude a peace with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. Both &s;ides were by this time weary of the war, and a pacification en&s;ued, in which Elizabeth was not comprehended. Nay, the Hu|guenots, whom &s;he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted, actually joined the forces of the French king, which undertook the &s;iege of Havre de Grace, occupied by the earl of Warwick at the head of an Engli&s;h garri&s;on. The place was defended with uncommon<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE>
<PB N="16" REF="180">
courage and per&s;everance, until the plague in&s;inuated it&s;elf among the be|&s;ieged; and then they were obliged to capitulate. The remains of the garri|&s;on carried over the infection to London, where it &s;wept off above thirty thou|&s;and of the inhabitants; and the reduction of Havre de Grace was &s;ucceeded<NOTE PLACE="marg">M$zerai.</NOTE> by a truce between the two nations.</P>

<P>The death of the duke of Gui&s;e produced a great change in the af|fairs of the Scotti&s;h queen. Charles IX. of France was now governed by the coun&s;el of his mother, who &s;ubjected Mary to divers mortifications. The payment of her jointure was intermitted; the Scotti&s;h guard di&s;banded, and the duke of Chateleraud deprived of his French revenue. Her uncle the car|dinal fearing that this treatment would provoke her to a &s;incere coalition with Elizabeth, pre&s;&s;ed her to marry Charles archduke of Au&s;tria, brother to Maxi|milian king of the Romans; and &s;he &s;eemed to reli&s;h the propo&s;al, which, as an in&s;tance of confidence, &s;he communicated to the queen of England. Eli|zabeth, alarmed at the pro&s;pect of &s;uch a powerful match as might enable her rival to execute the &s;cheme which the cardinal had projected, ordered Ran|dolph, her mini&s;ter in Scotland, to tell Mary in her name, that out of &s;i&s;terly affection and regard for her intere&s;t, &s;he could not help exhorting her to con|&s;ider that &s;uch an alliance might remove her for ever from the throne of England; as the Engli&s;h would never run the ri&s;que of being &s;ubject to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria: &s;he ought therefore to con&s;ult her own intere&s;t, in conciliat|ing the affection of the Engli&s;h people, by matching with &s;ome popular and di&s;tingui&s;hed nobleman of their country. Though Randolph pointed at no particular per&s;on, he in&s;inuated to Mary's natural brother, by this time created earl of Murray, and to &s;ecretary Lidington, that he believed his queen had lord Dudley in her eye, as a proper hu&s;band for their &s;overeign. Mary im|parted this an&s;wer to her uncle the cardinal, who vehemently di&s;&s;uaded her from contracting a match &s;o unworthy of her dignity, and flattered her with the promi&s;e of an alliance in her favour, to be formed by the pope, the kings of France and Spain, and the Engli&s;h Roman catholics. Mary was not a little perplexed by the&s;e oppo&s;ite coun&s;els; at length &s;he re&s;olved to think no more of the match with the archduke, and to decline the hinted propo&s;al of Elizabeth, without interrupting the corre&s;pondence between them, which afforded oppor|tunities of cultivating her Engli&s;h friends; and the&s;e were now become very numerous by the death of Frances Brandon dutche&s;s of Suffolk, who was her<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> rival in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as having been grandaughter of the &s;eventh Henry.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 1564.</NOTE> The truce between France and England was at length improved into a peace, negotiated by Sir Thomas Smith and Throgmorton, who had been arre&s;ted in France at the declaration of war. The treaty, which was concluded at Troye in Champagne, made no mention of the re&s;titution of Calais; but imported that the ho&s;tages &s;hould be &s;et at liberty on the payment of one hundred and twenty thou&s;and crowns to Elizabeth; and that peace and amity &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the contracting powers, with full re&s;ervation of their mutual rights and preten&s;ions. Immediately after the ratification of this treaty. Charles IX. was created a knight of the garter, and the lord Hun&s;don &s;ent over to Paris to inve&s;t him with the en&s;igns of the order. England at this juncture enjoyed the mo&s;t profound tranquillity. Her trade with the Low$ Countries had been interrupted by th$ intrigues of cardinal Granville, who,

fore&s;eeing a war in the Netherlands, wanted to remove the Engli&s;h, and per|&s;uaded the government to prohibit the importation of Engli&s;h broad cloth; a branch of traffic which was carried on to a prodigious extent. But Philip perceiving this prohibition was in all re&s;pects as detrimental to his own &s;ub|jects as to tho&s;e of England, de&s;ired the old treaty, made in the reign of Maximilian, might be renewed; and the affair was determined to the &s;ati&s;|faction of both nations.</P>

<P>The repo&s;e of queen Elizabeth was &s;till invaded by the appre|hen&s;ion of Mary's de&s;igns upon her crown and dignity. She could not bear the thoughts of competition for the throne &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: &s;he had not forgiven that prince&s;s for having a&s;&s;umed her arms and title, and refu&s;ed to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh: &s;he dreaded her marriage with &s;ome Roman catholic prince, who might be able to a&s;&s;ert her preten&s;ions; and &s;he was even weak enough to repine at the fame of her beauty and per&s;onal accompli&s;hments. On the other hand, Mary had been taught to con&s;ider the queen of England as a ba&s;tard, an heretic, a u&s;urper, who intercepted her right to one of the faire&s;t kingdoms of Europe, and fomented rebellion in the heart of her do|minions. The&s;e cau&s;es of animo&s;ity &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, there was no room for &s;in|cerity of friend&s;hip and mutal confidence; neverthele&s;s, both found their account in di&s;&s;embling their real &s;entiments. Elizabeth, in order to di&s;&s;uade her from marrying the archduke, made u&s;e of &s;ome arguments which gave offence to Mary; and &s;he, in her an&s;wer, u&s;ed expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;gu&s;t that in|cen&s;ed the queen of England; &s;o that, for &s;ome time, their corre&s;pondence &s;uffered an interruption. Mary reflecting how much it was her intere&s;t to main|tain<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil's Me|moirs.</NOTE> an intercour&s;e with Elizabeth, &s;ent Sir James Melvil to London, with a letter containing &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions; and a propo&s;al of renewing their former friend&s;hip. The queen of England, who &s;urpa&s;&s;ed her in di&s;&s;imulation, ad|mitted her excu&s;es with great good humour, expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t affection for her royal kin&s;woman; and, in order to prevent her e&s;pou&s;ing a foreign prince, endeavoured to engage her in a negotiation for a marriage with lord Dudley, to whom &s;he plainly alluded, though &s;he never mentioned his name. Not that &s;he wi&s;hed this match might really take effect: &s;he loved Dudley too well to part with him to a dete&s;ted rival; but her aim was to detach the queen of Scotland from the alliance with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and amu&s;e her with a treaty which never would be brought to perfection.</P>

<P>Mary, far from thinking &s;eriou&s;ly of e&s;pou&s;ing Dudley, had al|ready re&s;olved to give her hand to the lord Darnley, &s;on of the earl of Len|nox, who had married the daughter of Margaret queen of Scotland, and Archibald Douglas her &s;econd hu&s;band. Henry VIII. who was this lady's uncle, be&s;towed her in marriage upon Matthew Stuart earl of Lennox, who, in his reign, took refuge in England; &s;o that the queen of Scots purpo&s;ed to unite the rights of the two families by her marriage with lord Darnley, who, as well as her&s;elf, was a grandchild of the &s;eventh Henry. Su&s;pecting that Elizabeth would thwart her in this de&s;ign, &s;hould &s;he di&s;cover it, &s;he acted with great circum&s;pection; and, as a previous &s;tep, recalled the earl of Lennox into Scotland, that he might be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his lands, which had been confi&s;cated during the regency of the duke of Chateleraud. The queen of England perceived her drift, though &s;he &s;eemed entirely ignorant of her
<PB N="18" REF="200">
purpo&s;e; for &s;he was not &s;orry to find &s;he had ca&s;t her eyes on a young noble|man who&s;e father po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great e&s;tate in England, con&s;equently would be &s;o far &s;ubject to her will and plea&s;ure, that &s;he could prevent the marriage without interrupting the treaty. Mary di&s;gui&s;ed her &s;entiments with equal art: &s;he pretended to be guided entirely by the coun&s;els of Elizabeth; and, even after &s;he re&s;olved to wed the lord Darnley, appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with tho&s;e of England on the &s;ubject of her marriage, though &s;he very well knew that Elizabeth would propo&s;e Dudley, whom &s;he had by this time<NOTE PLACE="marg">Comden.</NOTE> created earl of Leice&s;ter. Accordingly, the earl of Bedford being appointed commi&s;&s;ioner, conferred with the earl of Murray, and &s;ecretary Lidington, at Berwick, where he recommended Leice&s;ter as a proper hu&s;band for queen Mary: but the propo&s;al was received &s;o coldly by the Scotti&s;h deputies, that he did not think proper to in&s;i&s;t upon it, e&s;pecially as the earl of Leice&s;ter had de&s;ired he would not pre&s;s the affair, either becau&s;e he knew it would be di&s;agreeable to Elizabeth, or would interfere with the de&s;ign he har|boured of e&s;pou&s;ing his own &s;overeign. Sir James Melvil, at his return to Scot|land, a&s;&s;ured his mi&s;tre&s;s that there was no &s;incerity in the profe&s;&s;ions of Elizabeth, who never intended that &s;he &s;hould marry Dudley; but only amu&s;ed her with &s;uch propo&s;als, that &s;he might be diverted from the Au&s;trian match. He gave her to under&s;tand that the queen of England had &s;ent the earl of Su&s;&s;ex to the imperial court, on purpo&s;e to prevent the marriage, by in&s;inuating that &s;he her&s;elf was well di&s;po&s;ed to accept the archduke for her hu&s;band; and this di&s;|covery did not dimini&s;h the hatred of Mary towards Elizabeth. The empe|ror dying in the cour&s;e of this year, was &s;ucceeded by Maximilian, who had been always aver&s;e to the Scotti&s;h match; &s;o that Elizabeth, having nothing further to fear from that quarter, began to di&s;cover her real &s;entiments. Mary, in order to &s;ound her inclinations, had promi&s;ed to comply with her de&s;ire in wedding the earl of Leice&s;ter, provided &s;he would declare her pre|&s;umptive heir of the Engli&s;h crown; and now Elizabeth in&s;tructed Ran|dolph, her amba&s;&s;ador in Scotland, to tell her cou&s;in Mary, that &s;he would rai&s;e Leice&s;ter to all the honour &s;he could be&s;tow upon a &s;ubject, and favour the title of the queen of Scots in every thing but the inqui&s;ition of her right, and the declaration of her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in which &s;he would do nothing until &s;he her&s;elf<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keith.</NOTE> &s;hould either marry, or notify her determination on that &s;ubject. Though Mary had never repo&s;ed any real confidence in her &s;incerity, &s;he was &s;o &s;hocked at this me&s;&s;age, that &s;he could not help bur&s;ting into tears, and reviling Elizabeth for her double-dealing.</P>

<P>By this time the queen of Scotland was in a great mea&s;ure di|rected by David Riccio, an ob&s;cure Piedmonte&s;e, who came to Scotland in the &s;ervice of the count de Moretto, the amba&s;&s;ador of Savoy. He was fir&s;t em|ployed as mu&s;ician at the court of Mary, with whom he &s;oon ingratiated him&s;elf by his in&s;inuating addre&s;s, and was promoted to the office of &s;e|cretary for the French language. He afterwards became her chief favourite and coun&s;ellor, and attracted the envy and hatred of the nobility, who looked upon him as a pre&s;umptuous up&s;tart, intoxicated and rendered in&s;olent by the favour of their &s;overeign; and all the prote&s;tant lords dete&s;ted him as an agent of the pope. In all likelihood this &s;tranger had a con&s;iderable &s;hare in per&s;uading Mary to e&s;pou&s;e the lord Darnley, who was a profe&s;&s;ed Roman
<PB N="19" REF="210">
catholic, and therefore agreeable to the cardinal of Lorraine; though he affected at fir&s;t to di&s;approve of the marriage. Darnley having obtained leave from Elizabeth to make a journey into Scotland, was received by queen Mary with extraordinary marks of e&s;teem; and the beauty of his per&s;on &s;oon made an impre&s;&s;ion upon her heart. He forthwith engaged in the &s;tricte&s;t in|timacy with Riccio; and now the credit of Murray, who was at the head of the prote&s;tant party, vi&s;ibly decrea&s;ed. All his enemies were called to court; and he entered into an a&s;&s;ociation with the duke de Chateleraud, the profe&s;&s;ed enemy of Lennox, the earls of Argyle, Rothes, Marr, Glencairn, and &s;eve|ral other noblemen, to oppo&s;e a marriage which they believed would be fatal to the reformed religion. Mean while Mary obtained a di&s;pen&s;ation from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> pope, together with a formal approbation of the marriage, &s;igned by the noblemen who were devoted to her intere&s;t and inclination; then &s;he wrote a letter to Elizabeth, communicating her intention, again&s;t which &s;he &s;eemed to think her &s;i&s;ter and cou&s;in could have no objection.</P>

<P>The queen of England immediately convoked a council, to deli|berate on this affair; and the re&s;ult of their con&s;ultation was, that the mar|riage would endanger the religion and &s;afety of England, in e&s;tabli&s;hing the Roman catholic doctrine in Scotland; and uniting the intere&s;t of two hou&s;es which pretended to the Engli&s;h crown. Sir Nicholas Throgmorton was immediately di&s;patched with in&s;tructions to expo&s;tulate with Mary again&s;t the match; and repre&s;ent that by &s;uch a &s;tep, which was extremely di&s;agreeable to the Engli&s;h nation, &s;he would run the ri&s;que of &s;eeing all her hopes of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion defeated. Mary replied, that &s;he had gone too far to recede; and that queen Elizabeth had the le&s;s rea&s;on to complain, as &s;he had followed her ad|vice, in chu&s;ing for a hu&s;band an Engli&s;h nobleman of the royal blood of both kingdoms. The queen of England finding her remon&s;trances ineffectual, &s;ent orders to the earl of Lennox and his &s;on to return, on pain of forfeiting their e&s;tate; but they did not think proper to obey her command: then &s;he directed Throgmorton to encourage the malecontents of Scotland, with the promi&s;e of her a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection; but, notwith&s;tanding all her endeavours, the mar|riage between the Scotti&s;h queen and Darnley was celebrated on the twenty|ninth day of July. Mary putting her&s;elf at the head of &s;ome troops, purfued the malecontents from place to place, until they were obliged to take refuge in England. Murray being cho&s;en their deputy, repaired to London and &s;ollicited the protection of Elizabeth, who gave him to under&s;tand, by her emi&s;&s;aries, that he had nothing to expect from her, unle&s;s he would publicly own that &s;he had no concern in their revolt.

<P>As Mary and her new hu&s;band engaged in fre&s;h &s;chemes again&s;t the intere&s;t of Elizabeth, this prince&s;s &s;ent a per&s;on called Tamworth, with a letter to the queen of Scots, demanding that the lord Darnley &s;hould be de|livered into her hands, according to the &s;tipulation in the la&s;t treaty, by which
<PB N="20" REF="220">
the two queens obliged them&s;elves to give up the rebellious &s;ubjects of each other. To this letter Mary replied, that &s;he would attempt nothing in Eng|land during the life of Elizabeth, provided &s;he might be declared pre&s;umptive<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> heir of the crown by act of parliament. She had, however, &s;ent Yoxley to the court of Spain, and put her&s;elf and her hu&s;band under the protection of Philip. After the di&s;&s;olution of the council of Trent, the pope had endea|voured to form a league with the courts of France, Spain, and the empire, for the extirpation of the reformed religion: at length, in a conference between the queen of Spain and her brother the French king, who met on the frontiers; and, by means of a corre&s;pondence between the queen-mother and the duke of Alva, the re&s;olution was taken, and mea&s;ures were concerted for cru&s;hing the Huguenots in France, the prote&s;tants in the Low-Countries, and the reforma|tion<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> in all parts of Europe. This league, thus formed at Bayonne, was &s;ent over to Scotland, and &s;ub&s;cribed by Mary; and her relations, of the hou&s;e of<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> Gui&s;e, pre&s;&s;ed her to proceed with rigour again&s;t the fugitive lords. The&s;e &s;ollicitations were &s;upported by her mini&s;ter Riccio, who maintained a corre|&s;pondence with the pope; and Mary's council agreed that the forfeiture of the rebe$s &s;hould be propo&s;ed in the parliament, which had been prorogued immedi|ately after its la&s;t meeting. In a word, the Roman catholic intere&s;t now pre|vailed at court: &s;he admitted the earls of Huntley and Bothwell into her council and confidence, and every thing &s;eemed to portent the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the old religion.</P>

<P>Almo&s;t all the common people of Scotland were prote&s;tant fana|tics. The majority of the nobles had embraced the &s;ame religion, becau&s;e they found their account in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the church-lands, which they &s;eized at the beginning of the reformation. Some of the&s;e reformers &s;till maintained an in|fluence at court; namely, the earl of Morton, and the lords Ruthven and Lind&s;ay. They dreaded the forfeiture of the fugitive lords, which would have ruined the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Scotland. They perceived the king was di&s;|gu&s;ted at Riccio, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that he had hitherto prevented him from $btaining the matrimonial crown: that he engro&s;&s;ed too great a &s;hare in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> queen's favour, and a&s;&s;umed the whole admini&s;tration. Henry was weak, giddy, and incon&s;tant; di&s;&s;olute, proud, and imperious. He had &s;ollicited the matrimonial crown with the utmo&s;t impatience, and treated the queen in the mo&s;t in&s;olent manner. Mary could not help de&s;pi&s;ing his character, and re|&s;enting<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> his pre&s;umption. The earl of Morton knew his di&s;po&s;ition, and tam|pered with his pa&s;&s;ions, by means of his emi&s;&s;ary George Douglas, the king's natural un$le. His re&s;entment was inflamed again&s;t Riccio, whom they re|pre&s;ented as his inveterate enemy, who would alienate the queen's affection from him, and entirely &s;uper&s;ede his authority, unle&s;s he would form a balance of power in his own favour, by procuring the pardon of the exiled lords. In which $afe they would not only fix the matrimonial crown upon his head, but al&s;o pa&s;s an act of parliament for continuing the royal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in his per&s;on, &s;hould<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> he &s;urvive queen Mary. They re&s;olved upon the death of Riccio, as a ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;tep towares the &s;ucce&s;s of this alliance. Henry took an oath of &s;ecrecy. Art$$les were drawn between him and the rebel lords. He bound him|&s;elf to ob$ain their remi&s;&s;ion, re&s;tore them to their e&s;tates, e&s;pou&s;e their ju&s;t quarrels, and concur with them in &s;upporting and e&s;tabli&s;hing the prote&s;tant
<PB N="$$" REF="230">
religion. They obliged them&s;elves to procure for him the matrimonial crown, and to maintain his title to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;hould the queen die without i&s;&s;ue. He likewi&s;e &s;igned a bond, declaring, that as the murder of Riccio was under|taken at his own de&s;ire, he would bear the perpetrators harmle&s;s. The&s;e ar|ticles being &s;ettled, the king, on the ninth day of March, about &s;even in the evening, entered the queen's apartment, while &s;he was at &s;upper with the counte&s;s of Argyle, her natural brother the commendator of Holyrood-hou&s;e, David Riccio, and &s;everal other per&s;ons. He was followed by Patrick Ruth|ven, who commanded Riccio to follow him, in the king's name. Mary a&s;k|ing if her hu&s;band had given &s;uch orders; and he an&s;wering in the negative, &s;he ordered Ruthven out of her pre&s;ence, declaring that Riccio &s;hould appear before the parliament, and an&s;wer to what might be laid to his charge. Then Ruthven attempting to &s;eize the &s;ecretary, he fled for refuge behind the queen's chair. At that in&s;tant George Douglas, with a party of armed men, ru&s;hing into the apartment, &s;truck him with a dagger over her &s;houlder, while the queen attempting to interpo&s;e in his defence, was withheld by her hu&s;band. He<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil.</NOTE> was then dragged into another chamber, and butchered by the con&s;pirators. Ruthven returning to the queen, upbraided her with following the coun&s;els of Riccio; with having favoured the Romi&s;h religion; admitted Huntley and Bothwell into her council; engaged with foreign powers for the de&s;truction of the prote&s;tants; and with having attained the fugitive lords, who were expected in Edinburgh next day, in con&s;equence of the king's pardon and me&s;&s;age. While the con&s;pirators acted this tragedy, the earl of Morton &s;ecured the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keith.</NOTE> gates of the palace with a body of troops. Huntley, Bothwell, and &s;ome others, e&s;caped out at windows; but the earl of Athol, &s;ecretary Lidington, Tullibardin, and Sir James Balfour, were permitted to retire. The queen was detained all night a pri&s;oner in her apartment. Next morning Henry i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, commanding all the lords &s;piritual and temporal con|vened to parliament to retire in three hours from Edinburgh; and, in the evening, the earls of Murray and Rothes, with their friends, arrived from England. A council being held, it was re&s;olved that the queen &s;hould be &s;ent under a guard to the ca&s;tle of Stirling, to remain in cu&s;tody until &s;he &s;hould approve in parliament of all they had done, e&s;tabli&s;h the prote&s;tant re|ligion, be&s;tow the matrimonial crown upon the king, and re&s;ign the whole ad|mini&s;tration into his hands.</P>

<P>Mary, in this deplorable &s;ituation, had recour&s;e to the friend&s;hip of her brother Murray, who, rather than incur any &s;hare of the odium re&s;ult|ing from the murder of Riccio, refu&s;ed to join the perpetrators. The king, who was extremely fickle and irre&s;olute, began to repent of that barbarous tran&s;action; and the queen perceiving him fluctuating, propo&s;ed an accom|modation, which they were now glad to embrace. When the articles were drawn up, &s;he ob&s;erved that it would be of no force &s;hould &s;he &s;ign them while &s;he remained in captivity; and the guard being withdrawn, &s;he e&s;caped to Dunbar, whither &s;he was accompanied by her hu&s;band. Having thus re|covered her liberty, &s;he pardoned the earls of Murray, Argyle, Rothes, and Glencairn; as for the duke of Chateleraud, he had parted from them before their flight to England. Then &s;he gave vent to her indignation again&s;t the murderers of Riccio. Morton, Ruthven, and Douglas, fled to Newca&s;tle; but
<PB N="$$" REF="240">
&s;ome of their $$comp$$ces were executed; and now &s;he laid a&s;ide all marks of regard for Henry. Indeed, when we con&s;ider, over and above the former provocations &s;he had undergone from his in&s;olent behaviour, this la&s;t additi|onal outrage, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that any woman of &s;pirit and &s;en&s;ibility could help looking upon him with abhorrence and dete&s;tation. He had even con|trived the murder of her favourite in &s;uch a manner as would mo&s;t conduce to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil.</NOTE> her horror and affliction. He in&s;i&s;ted upon Riccio$s being a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in her pre&s;ence, although &s;he was at that time &s;ix months advanced in her pregnancy; allowed her to be in&s;ulted by Ruthven, while her mind mu&s;t have been in the utmo&s;t agitation; and afterwards confined her in a chamber, $word$ from her attendants, when mo&s;t &s;he needed their a&s;&s;i&s;tance and con&s;olation. No wonder then that &s;he now treated him in her turn with indifference and di&s;dain. When &s;he a&s;&s;embled a body of forces and returned to Edinburgh, he di&s;owned the tran&s;action in the privy-council, and &s;igned a declaration to this effect, which was publi&s;hed by way of proclamation; &s;o that he incurred the univer&s;al con|tempt of the people. The queen effected a formal reconciliation between the fugitive lords and the earls of Huntley and Bothwell; though it does not &s;eem to have been &s;incere on the part of the latter, who endeavoured to per|&s;uade her that Murray intended to bring back Morton and his confederates, while &s;he &s;hould be confined in child-bed.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ 1966</NOTE> On the nineteenth day of June Mary was delivered of a &s;on, in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh; and Sir James Melvil immediately di&s;patched to the court of England, to notify this event to Elizabeth, who was de&s;ired to &s;tand godmother to the prince of Scotland. The amba&s;&s;ador found Elizabeth at Greenwich, where he was graciou&s;ly received; and the queen expre&s;&s;ed un|common joy at the news of Mary's delivery. But this was all affectation; for when Cecil made her acquainted with the event on the preceding evening, while &s;he was engaged in a ball with her nobility, &s;he forthwith di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the com|pany, and exhibited marks of &s;orrow and mortification. She &s;eemed to think Mary's pregnancy a reproach upon her own barrenne&s;s. She looked upon that prince&s;s with the eyes of jealou&s;y and envy. She had been lately &s;eized with a di&s;order; and during her indi&s;po&s;ition, the mini&s;try began to cabal about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Both parties, though ignorant of each other's re&s;olution, had de|termined, in ca&s;e of Elizabeth's death, to rai&s;e Mary to the throne of England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil.</NOTE> Perhaps the queen had received &s;ome intimation of their de&s;ign, and con&s;idered the birth of this child as an event that would corroborate the intere&s;t of her rival. Her fears from that quarter were lately increa&s;ed by the intelligence received by one Rook&s;by, whom Cecil employed as a &s;py at the court of Mary. This man pretended to be a refugee from England, and profe&s;&s;ed the deepe&s;t ran|cour again&s;t Elizabeth. He found means to in&s;inuate him&s;elf into the confi|dence of Mary, and di&s;covered all her practices in England to his patr$n Cecil. Sir Robert Melvil, the Scotti&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at London, was forbid the court, for having caballed in favour of his mi&s;tre&s;s among the Engli&s;h malecontents. He, being informed of Rook&s;by's real character, gave notice to his mi&s;tre&s;s, who ordered the &s;py to be arre&s;ted, and &s;eized upon his papers, among which were &s;ome of Cecil's letters in cypher. Sir Henry Killigrew had been &s;ent to Scotland as amba&s;&s;ador-extraordinary, to congratulate Mary upon her recover|ing her liberty: and to a&s;&s;ure her that the queen of England had, by a pro|clamation,
<PB N="23" REF="250">
ordered the earl of Morton and his accomplices to quit her domi|nions: notwith&s;tanding which proclamation, they were privately a&s;&s;ured of her protection. Killigrew was likewi&s;e in&s;tructed to complain of &s;ome di&s;orders upon the border; of Mary's corre&s;ponding with O'Neal of Ireland, to &s;pirit up a rebellion in that country; and of her protecting Rook&s;by, who was a re|bellious &s;ubject of England. This la&s;t article of complaint furni&s;hed the Scot|ti&s;h queen with a pretext for arre&s;ting Rook&s;by; but Killigrew hearing of the di&s;covery &s;he had made, communicuted the particulars to Cecil, and Elizabth thought proper to drop the affair.</P>

<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances con&s;idered, the two queens mu&s;t have hated one another with the mo&s;t implacable animo&s;ity. Yet they &s;till pre&s;erved the external marks of friend&s;hip. Mary, in order to $$$ace the impre&s;&s;ions which Rook&s;by's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> intelligence mu&s;t have made upon the mind of the Engli&s;h queen, wrote a let|ter to Sir Robert Melvil, forbidding him to maintain any corre&s;pondence with the malecontents of England; and &s;ent another to &s;ecretary Cecil, prote&s;ting that &s;he would give them no &s;ort of countenance. Elizabeth, on the other hand, con&s;ented to &s;tand godmother to the young prince of Scotland, who was bap|ti$ed by the name of James, at Stirling, in pre&s;ence of the amba&s;&s;adors from France, England, and Savoy. After the ceremony, the earl of Bedford, who<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wal&s;ingham.</NOTE> was Elizabeth's amba&s;&s;ador, pro&s;&s;ed the queen of Scotland to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh: but Mary declined complying with this reque&s;t. Neverthele&s;s, $he offered to &s;ign a new $reaty, importing that &s;he &s;hould not a&s;&s;ume the title or arms of the queen of England, during the life of Elizabeth and her po&s;terity. By this time her ha&s;band was treated with &s;uch indignity, that the earl of Bedford, when he departed from Scotland, de&s;ired Sir James Melvil to tell the queen from him, that &s;he ought to live in $$$ther manner with the king, for the &s;ake of her own reputation. He is even &s;aid to have been kept de&s;titute<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil.</NOTE> of decent apparel, &s;o that he could not appear in public; while the earl of Bothwell flouri&s;hed in the queen's favour, and &s;hone with the $tmo&s;t magni|ficence, to the manife&s;t di&s;&s;atisfaction of the people, who looked upon him $s an ambitious and pro&s;ligate nobleman, deveid of principle and decorum.</P>

<P>About this period Elizabeth vi&s;ited the univer&s;ity of Oxford, where &s;he was magnificently entertained for a whole week, during which &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted at &s;everal academical exerci&s;es. She an&s;wered a Greek or$tion in the &s;ame language; and, in a Latin &s;peech, a&s;&s;ured the univer&s;ity of her con&s;tant<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> favour and protection. She had been at Cambridge on a former occa&s;ion; and, in the &s;ame manner, $e&s;tified her approbation of that univer&s;ity. On her return to London from the &s;ummer progre&s;s, the parliament was a&s;&s;embled; and a motion was made in the lower hou&s;e for petitioning her maje&s;ty, that &s;he would be plea&s;ed to marry, and &s;e$tle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown. This mo|tion was &s;ugge&s;ted by the earls of Pembroke and Leice&s;ter, who had openly declared for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of queen Mary, as well as by the duke of Norfolk, who acted more covertly in her behalf; yet, in the debates which it produced among the commons, no mention was made of that prince&s;s. Some main|tained the claim of Catherine Gray counte&s;s of Hertford; others propo&s;ed her younger &s;i&s;ter the counte&s;s of Cumberland. Cecil oppo&s;ed the motion, and was reviled without doors, in lampoons and de&s;amatory libels. The populace in|veighed again&s;t the queen's phy&s;ician Dr. Hui$, who was &s;aid to have di&s;&s;uaded her from marrying, on account of &s;ome bodily infirmity; and &s;ome members
<PB N="24" REF="260">
within the hou&s;e ventured even to charge her with abandoning her country, and p$&s;t$rity. The addre&s;s being pre&s;ented, &s;he &s;ignified her intention to marry; but ob&s;erved that &s;he could not declare her &s;ucce&s;&s;or without danger to her own per&s;on. The commons, di&s;&s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, began to re&s;ume the matter; and &s;he &s;ent two me&s;&s;ages, requiring them to proceed no further. At length &s;he remitted the third payment of a &s;ub&s;idy they had granted, in hope o$ prevailing upon her to declare her &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with a &s;peech, in which &s;he reprimanded them &s;harply for their officious interpo&s;i|tion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> She knew, that although they had not named Mary, &s;he was the per&s;on at whom they aimed: &s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h the friends and abettors of that prince&s;s; and the earls of Pembroke and Leice&s;ter were for &s;ome time di&s;|graced on account of their attachment to the queen of Scotland. Nor was it without rea&s;on that Elizabeth declined taking any open &s;tep in favour of Mary's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, if there was any truth in the a&s;&s;ertion of Melvil, who af|firms the friends of the Scotti&s;h queen were increa&s;ed to &s;uch a decree in Eng|land, that &s;ome whole counties were ready to take up arms in her favour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melv$$.</NOTE> under officers already named by the chief nobility.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="33" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e &s;teps taken in behalf of Mary, by her friends in Eng|land, were fru&s;trated by an unfortunate event which about this time happened<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. $word$ 1$6$.</NOTE> in her own kingdom. She had for &s;ome time lived unhappily with her hu&s;|band, who&s;e folly, caprice, and pre&s;umption, &s;eemed daily to increa&s;e. He had lo&s;t all credit at court, and of con&s;equence hated tho&s;e who &s;eemed to have &s;uper&s;eded his in&s;iuence. Among the&s;e were Bothwell, Murray, and Lidington, who had by this time prevailed upon the queen to pardon Morton and Lind|&s;ay, for the murder of Riccio: Ruthven would have enjoyed the &s;ame favour, had not he died at Newca&s;tle before the remi&s;&s;ion could be obtained. Henry was &s;o incen&s;ed again&s;t Murray, that he threatened to take away his life; and the other receiving intimation of his de&s;ign, is &s;aid to have con|trived a &s;cheme for anticipating his purpo&s;e, by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the king him|&s;elf. That this project might operate the more effectually for his own inte|re&s;t, he is &s;aid to have engaged Bothwell in the execution of the murder, by &s;oothing his vanity and ambition with the hope of e&s;pou&s;ing his &s;overeign. He looked upon this nobleman as the rival of his intere&s;t; and therefore &s;ought to rai&s;e him to a dangerous pinnacle of power, from which his fall would be the greater. Morton and Lidington were the confidents and abbettors of Murray in this enterprize. They had propo&s;ed a divorce to the queen, and &s;he could not be ave$&s;e to a &s;eparation from the man whom &s;he could neither love nor e&s;teem: but &s;he charged them to take no &s;tep which &s;hould hurt her con|&s;cience, or blemi&s;h her reputation. The king being taken ill at Gla&s;gow, of a di&s;temper which &s;ome people believed to be the effect of poi&s;on, admini&s;tred by the&s;e confederates, Mary ha&s;ted thither, and attended him with the mo&s;t conjugal tenderne&s;s, until he was in a condition to travel; then he was con|veyed in a litter to Edinburgh; and, as the air of Holyrood-hou&s;e was damp and unhealthy, lodged in a higher &s;ituation, at a place called the Kirkfield, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the city. The hou&s;e being undermined, was blown up with gun-powder in the middle of the night, and his body found at &s;ome<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bp. L$&s;ley.</NOTE> di&s;tance under a tree. The earl of Murray $ad &s;et out for St. Andrew's on the preceding day, on a vi&s;it to his wife, who had mi&s;carried: but, as he declared to one of his attendants, that the lord Darnley would lo&s;e his life before morn|ing,
<PB N="25" REF="270">
many people &s;u&s;pected that he was acce&s;&s;ary to the murder. But the voice of the public became &s;o clamorous again&s;t Bothwell, that he could not help taking &s;ome &s;teps for his own ju&s;tification.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="34" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>Mean while Murray, being informed of the king's fate, re|turned to court, where he found the queen incon&s;olable: yet Bothwell &s;till engro&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t &s;hare of the admini&s;tration. He offered to maintain his innocence in &s;ingle combat; and a paper was fixed up in &s;everal public places accepting his challenge, provided he would fight in a neutral place, where his own influence did not predominate. The earl of Lennox wrote a letter to the queen, impeaching Bothwell of the murder, and demanding ju&s;tice of her ma|je&s;ty: on the other hand, Murray, and &s;everal other noblemen, recommended him to the queen, as a proper per&s;on for her hu&s;band, both on account of his antient family and faithful &s;ervices. A proclamation had been i&s;&s;ued for de|tecting and apprehending the perpetrators of the king's murder; and Murray having concerted proper mea&s;ures with his a&s;&s;ociates, obtained leave to retire from the kingdom, that his ab&s;ence might the better &s;creen him from &s;u&s;picion. He accordingly &s;et out for France, taking his way through England, where his conduct &s;eems to have been countenanced. That he was concerned with the regicides, we may conclude from his declaration above mentioned, which the lord Herries affirmed to his face, at his own table, a few days after the murder; from the prote&s;tation of the earls of Huntley and Argyle to queen Elizabeth, in which they accu&s;ed Murray, Morton, and Lidington, as the contrivers of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; and from many other circum&s;tances of Mur|ray's character and conduct. At the &s;ame time we mu&s;t own, it is very &s;trange that neither Bothwell on his death-bed, nor Morton in his confe&s;&s;ion, nor any one per&s;on concerned in the murder, directly accu&s;ed Murray of having been an accomplice. The earl of Lennox continuing to importune Mary for ju&s;tice on Bothwell, and the other a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of his &s;on, this nobleman applied him&s;elf to the earl of Argyle, lord ju&s;ticiary of Scotland, de&s;iring that he might be brought to his trial. The day was accordingly fixed, and inti|mation given to the earl of Lennox: but this accu&s;er, con&s;cious of his own weakne&s;s in point of intere&s;t, did not think proper to appear again&s;t Bothwell, who had the whole power of the kingdom in his hands. He de&s;ired that the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> trial might be po&s;tponed; and his reque&s;t being denied, contented him&s;elf with &s;ending an agent to prote&s;t again&s;t the proceedings of the court; not|with&s;tanding which prote&s;t, Bothwell was acquitted, as no per&s;on appeared to carry on the pro&s;ecution; and his acquittal afterwards approved and con|firmed by parliament. Then a good number of the nobility engaged in a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keith.</NOTE> bond of a&s;&s;ociation to maintain his innocence with their bodies, heritage, and goods, and to promote and advance his marriage with her maje&s;ty.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="35" TYPE="section">

<P>Thus &s;upported, Bothwell re&s;olved to marry the queen by force, provided he could not obtain her voluntary con&s;ent: with this view he rai&s;ed a body of eight hundred hor&s;e, and intercepting her on her return from Stir|ling, conveyed her to his ca&s;tle of Dunbar, where he completed his rape. He forthwith commenced a &s;uit for a divorce from his wife, who was &s;i&s;ter to the earl of Huntley, on pretence of con&s;anguinity, in the court of the archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's; and &s;he pro&s;ecuted him at the &s;ame time, before the com|mi&s;&s;ary-court, for adultery with his maid-&s;ervant. He was convicted of the

adultery, and &s;entence of divorce awarded again&s;t him; and the archbi&s;hop declared his marriage null and void, becau&s;e he had, without a di&s;pen&s;ation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">K$$$h.</NOTE> married a per&s;on within the prohibited degrees of con&s;anguinity. Being now &s;eparated from his wife, in due cour&s;e of law, he conducted the queen to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, where &s;he pardoned him for the rape, created him duke of Orkney, and finally married him, on the fifteenth day of May, contrary to the general &s;en&s;e of her people, and that regard which &s;he ought to have pre&s;erved for her own reputation. Notwith&s;tanding the forgeries and calumny of her enemies, &s;he appears to have been not only innocent and ignorant of the de&s;ign again&s;t her husband's life, but al&s;o convinced of Bothwell's integrity. Neverthele&s;s, we cannot vindicate her from the charge of indi&s;cretion, in e&s;pou&s;ing a profligate nobleman, equally notorious for in&s;olence and bad mo|rals, &s;uppo&s;ed by the generality of her people guilty of her husband's murder; one who had pre&s;umed to ravi&s;h her, while his wife was &s;till living, and his marriage in force; and who was afterwards convicted of adultery with another woman. This was undoubtedly an imprudent and fatal &s;tep, by which &s;he entailed upon her&s;elf numberle&s;s mortifications, mi&s;ery, and ruin. Bothwell, not &s;atisfied with the honour of e&s;pou&s;ing his &s;overeign, endeavoured to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the per&s;on of the young prince, who had been committed to the care of the earl of Mar; but this nobleman refu&s;ed to part with his charge. On the contrary, he engaged in an a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t Bothwell, with tho&s;e very lords who had bound them&s;elves to maintain his intere&s;t.</P>

<P>He had now rendered him&s;elf odious to the nation; and Mur|ray, by who&s;e in&s;tigation they acted, thought it was high time to labour at his de&s;truction. Having formed a league at Stirling, they rai&s;ed a body of troops, on pretence of defending the young prince from the machinations of his father|in-law; and they had well nigh &s;urpri&s;ed the queen and her husband at Holy|rood-hou&s;e, from whence &s;he e&s;caped with difficulty to the ca&s;tle of Borthwick: there &s;he was beleaguered by the earl of Home; but he could not prevent her e&s;caping again to the ca&s;tle of Dunbar. Mean while the rebel lords entering Edinburgh, declared, by proclamation, their de&s;ign was to take vengeance on Bothwell for murdering the king, ravi&s;hing the queen, and con&s;piring again&s;t the life of the prince. From hence they proceeded again&s;t the queen, who had levied forces, and advanced as far as Pre&s;tonpans. The confederates found her po&s;ted upon Carberry-hill, and both &s;ides prepared for an engagement. De Croc the French amba&s;&s;ador endeavoured in vain to effect an accommoda|tion. After his mi&s;carriage, &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak with Kirkaldy, laird of Grange, who a&s;&s;ured her the confederates de&s;ired nothing el&s;e than that &s;he would &s;end away the murderer of her husband. Bothwell challenged any man that would<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mc$d.</NOTE> tax him with that crime. His challenge was accepted &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by Kirkaldy, Tullibardin, and the lord Lind&s;ay: but his heart failed, and he cho&s;e to retire. The queen having complied with the conditions propo&s;ed by the confederates, was conducted to Edinburgh, where the populace treated her with the utmo&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cr$$f$$d.</NOTE> indignity. From her palace of Holyrood-hou&s;e, &s;he was &s;ent under a &s;trong guard to the ca&s;tle of Lochlevin, belonging to W. Douglas, uterine brother to the earl of Murray, who received an order, &s;igned by the a&s;&s;ociated lords, to detain her in &s;afe cu&s;tody. She was accordingly clo&s;ely immured, and crueily in&s;ulted by Murray's mother, who pretended &s;he had been lawfully married to James V. and that Murray was the legitimate fruit of that marriage.</P>

<P>The lords having taken this rebellious &s;tep again&s;t the per|&s;on of their &s;overeign, apprehended &s;everal per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed of having been concerned in the murder of the king; and among the&s;e W. Blackadder, who was convicted and condemned by a packed jury, and declared at his death that he was innocent of the crime laid to his charge; but that he believed Murray and Morton were the contrivers of the regicide. They allowed Bothwell time to e&s;cape to the Orkneys, and then they &s;et a price upon his head by procla|mation. The laird of Grange equipped two ve&s;&s;els; and, being accompanied by the bi&s;hop of the Orkneys and the laird of Tullibardin, &s;ailed directly to tho&s;e i&s;les, from whence Bothwell e&s;caped with difficulty to Norway: but they took one of his &s;hips, with &s;ome of his adherents and &s;ervants, who were after|wards executed for the regicide. Some noblemen, who di&s;approved of the proceedings of the confederates, a&s;&s;embled at Hamilton, to deliberate upon means for relea&s;ing their &s;overeign; and to the&s;e the general a&s;&s;embly of the kirk, then &s;itting, &s;ent an invitation to come and a&s;&s;i&s;t in regulating eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal affairs; but they refu&s;ed to tru&s;t them&s;elves in a place where they imagined their per&s;ons would not be &s;afe. The queen of England being informed of Mary's impri&s;onment, affected to re&s;ent &s;uch an outrage offered by &s;ubjects to their &s;overeign; and perhaps &s;he actually felt an emotion of jealou&s;y at their pre&s;umption again&s;t the regal power, though from the beginning &s;he had cer|tainly fomented the troubles of Scotland. She di&s;patched Sir Nicholas Throg|morton to intercede for the captive queen, and to expre&s;s her di&s;plea&s;ure at Mary's confinement. He was in&s;tructed to threaten, in her name, that &s;he would relea&s;e their queen by force, &s;hould they refu&s;e to &s;et her at liberty on rea|&s;onable terms. He was furni&s;hed with a plan of accommodation between their &s;overeign and them; and directed to propo&s;e that the young prince &s;hould be educated in England. He was not permitted to &s;ee the queen, and all his en|deavours proved ineffectual. Perhaps Elizabeth was not &s;orry for his mi&s;carriage.</P>

<P>Knox, and the other presbyterian preachers, exerted all their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The rebel lords prepared three in&s;truments to be &s;igned by the queen; namely, her re&s;ignation of the crown to her infant &s;on; a commi&s;&s;ion appointing the earl of Murray regent during his minority; and another nominating a council to govern the realm, in ca&s;e of that noble|man's death, or his declining the office of regent. The&s;e deeds &s;he was compel|led,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> by the mo&s;t brutal u&s;age, to &s;ub&s;cribe; and Morton accepted her re&s;igna|tion, in the name of the three e&s;tates of Scotland, though he was ve&s;ted with no &s;uch power by that a&s;&s;embly. Then they proceeded to crown the prince, who was but thirteen months old; and the ceremony was performed at Stirling, by Adam Bothwell bi&s;hop of Orkney; but Throgmorton refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the coronation, and was, in a very little time after this tran&s;action, recalled by queen Elizabeth. The lords a&s;&s;embled at Hamilton, now entered into an a&s;|&s;ociation<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.</NOTE> for effecting the queen's relea&s;e; and, had they been unanimous, they might have &s;aved that unhappy prince&s;s from de&s;truction: but when Murray returned, and a&s;&s;umed the regency, they endeavoured &s;ingly to make peace with him; and he perceiving their di&s;union, compelled them to accept of &s;uch terms as he thought proper to propo&s;e.

at the ca&s;tle of Lochlevin, far from comforting her under her affliction, he reviled her with the mo&s;t injurious reproaches, and treated her &s;o barbarou&s;ly, that from thence forward &s;he con&s;idered him as her mortal enemy. His re|gency being confirmed, in a parliament convoked by him at Edinburgh, he &s;igned a warrant for the execution of Dalglei&s;h, Powry, and two other &s;er|vants of Bothwell, who had been tried and convicted of a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the king's murder.

<P>The French king being informed of Mary's misfortune, was &s;o incen&s;ed at her rebellious &s;ubjects, for &s;uch an outrage again&s;t the royal pre|rogative, that he &s;ent over Pa&s;quier to London, to concert mea&s;ures with the queen for compelling the Scotti&s;h rebels to &s;et their &s;overeign at liberty. Eli|zabeth declined u&s;ing violent methods, on pretence that they would endanger the life of her dear cou&s;in; but &s;he propo&s;ed that the Scots &s;hould be entirely prohibited from trading with France and England, until their queen &s;hould be relea&s;ed. This was the only mea&s;ure in which Elizabeth and the French king were likely to concur. The term of eight years &s;ince the treaty of Cateau being now expired, Sir Thomas Smith was &s;ent over to Picardy, with Winter m$&s;ter of the ordnance for the &s;ea-&s;ervice, to demand the re&s;titution of Calais, which they accordingly claimed by &s;ound of trumpet, at one of the gates, in pre&s;ence of a $$tary, and &s;everal witne&s;&s;es. Then Smith proceeded to Paris, where, in conjunction with Sir Henry Norreys, the Engli&s;h re&s;ident at that court, he made the like demand of Charles, who appointed the chancellor de L'Hopital to &s;ignify the rea&s;ons which hindred him from re&s;toring Calais. The&s;e arguments were an&s;wered and refuted by Smith; and the affair pro|duced a long di&s;pute, which was not fini&s;hed when the civil wars broke out in Fr$nce: but the place was never re&s;tored. Mean while the emperor Maxi|milian &s;ent the count of Stolberg into England, to renew the treaty for a marriage between his brother Charles the archduke, and queen Elizabeth, who had often expre&s;&s;ed her approbation of &s;uch an alliance: but, after long debates touching the maintenance of Charles, his a&s;&s;uming the title of king$ and the &s;ettlement of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, it was wholly broke off, on account of their differing in point of religion; and Charles e&s;pou&s;ed Mary, daughter to the duke of Bavaria. At the &s;ame time amba&s;&s;adors arrived from John Ba&s;i|lowitz emperor of Ru&s;&s;ia, with rich pre&s;ents of furs to the queen, and a&s;|&s;urances of friend&s;hip and protection to the Engli&s;h merchants, who &s;hould &s;ettle or trade in his dominions. Anthony Jenkin&s;on, an Engli&s;hman, who had travelled through great part of the Ru&s;&s;ian dominions, accompanied the amba&s;&s;adors, with directions from the czar to propo&s;e an offen&s;ive and de|fen&s;ive alliance with the queen of England, again&s;t all the world. Though the civilly declined &s;uch a league, he indulged the Ru&s;&s;ia company with an exclu&s;ive trade to Archangel; and the Engli&s;h merchants in general with a monopoly for their cloth and other commodities throughout all his dominions.</P>

<P>About this period, Sir Henry Sidney, the queen's lord lieutenant for Ireland, extingui&s;hed &s;ome dangerous commotions which had ari&s;en in that country. Shan O'Neale had tyrannized over the inhabitants of Ul&s;ter, re|duced Armagh to a&s;hes, expelled Ma$guire from his patern$l inheritance, ra|$a$$d the lands of Ma$guire and other$, who were under the protection of

the Engli&s;h, and openly rebelled again&s;t Elizabeth. But, upon his &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, &s;he created him baron of Dungannon and earl of Tyrone. Not &s;atisfied with the&s;e honours, he a&s;&s;embled an army of his va&s;&s;als, a&s;&s;umed the title of king of Ul&s;ter, and offered to hold the kingdom of Ireland under the &s;ove|reignty of Mary queen of Scotland. Randolph, a brave officer, being &s;ent again&s;t him by the lieutenant, routed him with great &s;laughter at Derry, though the victor lo&s;t his life in the engagement. Shan fled to the bogs and fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, while Sir Henry Sidney built &s;ome forts to &s;traiten him in his quarters, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed O'Donnel, who had been driven from his country. But Sidney being called away to compromi&s;e a quarrel between the earls of Ormond and De&s;mond, Shan re-a&s;&s;embled a body of troops, and attacked Dundalk, from whence he was repul&s;ed by the garri&s;on. Then he carried off O'Donnel's wife, and retired to Clandeboy, to &s;ollicit the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Scotti&s;h highlanders, who had formerly joined his enemies, and been defeated by his forces. He had even &s;lain two brothers of the highland chieftains, who received him with &s;eeming courte&s;y; but, whether they had determined to make away with him, or he provoked them over his cups with brutal lan|guage, touching the cha&s;tity of their mother, they &s;lew him with all his com|pany. Though he left two legitimate &s;ons, his e&s;tate was confi&s;cated by the Iri&s;h parliament, and Tirlogh O'Neile was, by the queen's permi&s;&s;ion, elected chief of the &s;ept, by the appellation of O'Neile. Neverthele&s;s, as a check upon this new chieftain, &s;he received into favour Shan's nephew Hugh baron of Dungannon, a young man of a very intriguing genius. The di&s;orders of Ul&s;ter being thus appea&s;ed, the quarrel between the earls of Ormond and De&s;mond, who had fought a battle near Dromille, was partly quelled by the authority of the lieutenant, who was afterwards obliged to &s;urprize De&s;mond<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> and his uncle near Kilmalloc, and &s;end them pri&s;oners to England.</P>

<P>By this time the kings of France and Spain &s;eemed to have en|gaged<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1568.</NOTE> in a league to exterminate the prote&s;tants from their dominions. The duke of Alva entering the Low-Countries, at the head of a powerful army, committed unheard-of cruelties upon tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed the reformed reli|gion. The court of France levied &s;ix thou&s;and Swi&s;s, in order to cru&s;h the Huguenots. The prince of Cond&eacute; and the admiral re-a&s;&s;embling &s;ome forces for their own defence, attempted to &s;urprize the king at Meaux: but, fail|ing in that enterprize, the prince blocked up Paris; and, in the neighbour|hood of that capital, engaged the con&s;table, who was &s;lain in the action. The prince was afterwards joined by Ca&s;imir count Palatine, with ten thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot; and La Noue, one of the chiefs of the Huguenots, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Orleans. Queen Elizabeth, looking upon her own &s;afety as in&s;eparably connected with the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, ordered Norreys, her amba&s;&s;ador, to intercede with Charles in behalf of the Huguenots; and to a&s;&s;ure him that &s;he would not tamely &s;uffer them to be oppre&s;&s;ed. This in&s;inuation, together with the &s;uccours they received from Germany, induced the French court to con&s;ent to a pacification; the terms of which, however, they had no intention to ob&s;erve. Catherine de Medicis, the queen-mother, fore|&s;eeing a &s;peedy rupture, endeavoured to alienate Elizabeth from the intere&s;t of the French prote&s;tants; and for that purpo&s;e propo&s;ed a marriage between the Engli&s;h queen and her &s;on the duke of Anjou, who was then but &s;eventeen

years of age. While this was in agitation, Philip king of Spain took occa|&s;ion to manife&s;t his di&s;gu&s;t to the Engli&s;h nation. Man, who was Elizabeth's amba&s;&s;ador at Madrid, was forbid the court, and confined to a country vil|lage, for having dropped &s;ome di&s;re&s;pectful expre&s;&s;ions concerning the pope and the Roman catholic religion; and Sir John Hawkins, who commanded a fleet of merchant-&s;hips in the bay of Mexico, was attacked by the Spaniards, who &s;lew a great number of his men, and took and plundered three of his ve&s;&s;els. The queen was not a little incen&s;ed at the&s;e outrages, though &s;he<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$mden.</NOTE> found it convenient to &s;uppre&s;s &s;ome part of her re&s;entment.

<P>Mary queen of Scotland having e&s;caped from the ca&s;tle of Loch|levin, by the means of George Douglas the governor's brother, repaired to Hamilton, where &s;he found her&s;elf, in a few days, at the head of &s;ix thou&s;and men, a&s;&s;embled by the earls of Huntley, Sutherland, Errol, Montro&s;s, Craw|ford, Argyle, Ca&s;&s;ils, Rothes, and Eglington, the lords Somerville, Ye&s;ter, Living&s;ton, Borthwick, Herries, Sanquhar, Ro&s;s, Boyd, Ogilvy, Oliphant, Drummond, Elphin&s;ton, Sinclair, Cathcart, Claude Hamilton, and a great number of bi&s;hops, abbots, lairds, and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The&s;e en|gaged in an a&s;&s;ociation for the defence of her per&s;on, and the &s;upport of her royal authority: &s;he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, declaring that the in&s;trument &s;he had &s;igned at Lochlevin was extorted from her by the fear of death; and the lords there a&s;&s;embled adjudged her re&s;ignation to be null and invalid, as the effect of compul&s;ion. Murray was at that time within eight miles of Hamilton, hold|ing a ju&s;tice-court at Gla&s;gow, attended by the earls of Morton, Mar, Glen|cairn, the lord Sempill, and others of the council. He forthwith &s;ent for a &s;upply of five hundred men from Stirling, and was joined by the earl of Home, with &s;ix hundred men from the Mer&s;e and Lothian; &s;o that he re&s;olved to give battle, though his army did not exceed the number of four thou&s;and. The queen &s;ent John Beaton to England to &s;ollicit the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Elizabeth; and he was ordered to proceed to the court of France on the &s;ame errand: but the queen of England, who did not reli&s;h her application to the French monarch, a&s;&s;ured this envoy that &s;he would a&s;&s;i&s;t his mi&s;tre&s;s; and, in her in&s;tructions to Leighton, whom &s;he di&s;patched to Scotland with offers of her mediation, &s;he directed him to tell Mary's rebellious &s;ubjects, that the whole power of England &s;hould be employed in her behalf. In the mean time the loyali&s;ts advi&s;ed the queen to march towards Dumbarton, which was a &s;trong fortre&s;s, where &s;he could remain in &s;afety, until all her faithful &s;ubjects &s;hould<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keith.

<P>The queen fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation to the abbey of Dundrenan, near Kirkudbright, in Galloway; and embarking with the lord Herries, and a train of &s;ixteen per&s;ons, landed at Wirkington in Cumber|land. From thence &s;he was conducted to Cockermouth, and afterwards con|veyed to the ca&s;tle of Carlile by Lowther, deputy-governor of that fortre&s;s. On her fir&s;t arrival in England, &s;he wrote a letter to Elizabeth, giving a de|tail of her misfortunes, intimating her confidence in her &s;i&s;ter's princely af|fection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and reque&s;ting that &s;he might be conducted immediately into her pre&s;ence. Sir Francis Knolies was &s;ent to comfort her with a verbal
<PB N="31" REF="330">
promi&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but &s;he declined &s;eeing her, on pretence of her being charged with divers attrocious crimes, of which it would be nece&s;&s;ary to ac|quit her&s;elf. From Carlile, Mary &s;ent the lord Herries with another letter, renewing her reque&s;t of being admitted into Elizabeth's pre&s;ence, that &s;he might an&s;wer to the crimes laid to her charge. It was but rea&s;onable, &s;he &s;aid, that a prince&s;s &s;o near to her in blood, &s;hould hear and relieve her in her di&s;|tre&s;s; &s;he therefore de&s;ired that Elizabeth would either a&s;&s;i&s;t her again&s;t her rebellious &s;ubjects, or allow her to &s;ollicit &s;uccour in &s;ome other country; ob|&s;erving it was unju&s;t to detain her a pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle of Carlile, as &s;he had voluntarily come into the kingdom, confiding in the affection of her ma|je&s;ty, &s;o often expre&s;&s;ed by me&s;&s;engers, letters, and remembrances. The coun|cil of England were not a little perplexed at this event. They fore&s;aw that &s;hould Mary be allowed to retire, &s;he would find refuge in France, and the Gui&s;es would revive her claim to the crown of England; the old alliance between France and Scotland would be renewed; and the Engli&s;h faction in this la&s;t kingdom be wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. On the other hand, her detention in England would be condemned all over Europe as an act of the mo&s;t inhu|man barbarity and inju&s;tice; and perhaps excite the compa&s;&s;ion of the Eng|li&s;h, &s;o as to produce &s;ome dangerous commotion in favour of a prince&s;s whom the majority of them e&s;teemed as the pre&s;umptive heir to the crown. Notwith&s;tanding this apprehen&s;ion, they determined to detain her as a pri&s;oner, until &s;he &s;hould renounce her pre&s;ent claim to the crown of England, and vindicate her&s;elf from the charge of being acce&s;&s;ary to the mur|der of Lord Darnley, who was a natural &s;ubject of England. This determi|nation may be a&s;cribed to the political maxims of Cecil, who&s;e con&s;tant aim was to embroil all the neighbouring kingdoms; but in all probability it was influenced by the private pa&s;&s;ions of Elizabeth, who hated Mary as her rival in royalty, and her &s;uperior in beauty and other female accompli&s;hments. She wanted nothing but a pretence for detaining this illu&s;trious captive with &s;ome &s;hadow of ju&s;tice; and &s;he &s;eemed to be a&s;hamed of founding her de|tention upon the accu&s;ation of rebellious &s;ubjects, again&s;t who&s;e trea&s;on it was her duty to have protected her kin&s;woman. Be&s;ides, &s;he had no right to exerci&s;e any juri&s;diction over an independent &s;overeign, who was moreover intitled to all the rights of ho&s;pitality; and, by admitting the charge of noto|rious rebels again&s;t their mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he would have created a precedent equally di&s;graceful and dangerous to regal authority. On the&s;e con&s;iderations, &s;he tampered with Margaret counte&s;s of Lennox, Darnley's mother, who had been impri&s;oned on account of her &s;on's marriage, and relea&s;ed after his decea&s;e. This lady, who entirely depended upon Elizabeth, was per&s;uaded to pre|&s;ent a petition to the queen, praying that Mary of Scotland might be pro&s;e|cuted for her hu&s;band's murder. The counte&s;s, afterwards being convinced of Mary's innocence, implored forgivenne&s;s of that prince&s;s, a&s;&s;uring her &s;he had been deceived with fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, by the expre&s;s command of Elizabeth, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keith.</NOTE> the per&s;ua&s;ions of the lords of the privy-council.</P>

entirely on the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Elizabeth, who &s;ent Mr. Middlemore to &s;ummon the earl of Murray, either in per&s;on or by proxy, to appear in England, and &s;hew cau&s;e for the cruel treatment to which he had &s;ubjected his own &s;ove|reign, and her kin&s;woman; otherwi&s;e &s;he would a&s;&s;i&s;t her to the utmo&s;t of her power again&s;t all her enemies. Murray, who was perfectly well acquainted with the real &s;entiments of queen Elizabeth, cau&s;ed a commi&s;&s;ion to be expe|dited under the great &s;eal of Scotland, empowering him&s;elf, the earl of Mor|ton, the bi&s;hop of Orkney, the lord Lind&s;ay, and the abbot of Dumfermling, to meet the Engli&s;h deputies, and explain the rea&s;ons which induced them to proceed in &s;uch a manner again&s;t Mary. To the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, James Mac|gill, Henry Balnaves, and the celebrated George Buchanan, were joined as a&s;&s;i&s;tants. They were accompanied by the bi&s;hop of Murray, &s;ecretrary Lidington, the lairds of Pittarrow, North-Berwick, and Clei&s;h, Nicholas El|phin&s;ton, and John Wood &s;ecretary to the regent. They were met at York, in the beginning of October, by the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Suffolk, and Sir Ralph Sadler, appointed commi&s;&s;ioners by Elizabeth, to hear and examine all di&s;putes between Mary and the regent. At the &s;ame time the Scotti&s;h queen &s;ent thither John Le&s;ley bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, the lords Living&s;tone, Boyd, and Herries, Gavin Hamilton commendator of Kilwinning, with the lairds of Lochinvar, Kirling, Ro&s;lin, and Garntully, as her friends and commi&s;&s;ioners, to promote an agreement, under the mediation of Elizabeth; for they did not<NOTE PLACE="marg">Le&s;ey.</NOTE> at all expect that the queen of England intended to act the part of a judge. When they were undeceived in this particular, they entered a prote&s;t in the name of their &s;overeign, importing, that though &s;he had con&s;ented to her cou&s;in's hearing and terminating in per&s;on or by commi&s;&s;ioners, the differences between her and her rebellious &s;ubjects, &s;he did not acknowledge her&s;elf &s;ub|ject to any judge upon earth, being a free prince&s;s, and holding her imperial crown of God alone. The Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners made a prote&s;t in their turn, for &s;aving the &s;uperiority which England claimed over Scotland. Next day Mary's agents exhibited a paper, containing a detail of the rebellions which had been rai&s;ed again&s;t her. This was an&s;wered by Murray, who alledged that the lords had taken arms to revenge the death of king Henry upon Both|well; and that the queen, being weary of the toils of government, had volun|tarily re&s;igned the crown to her &s;on, and appointed the earl of Murray regent of the kingdom during his minority. Mary's commi&s;&s;ioners refuted the&s;e al|legations, and reque&s;ted that the queen of England would a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport their mi&s;tre&s;s in the recovery of her crown, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch rebel|lious attempts: they likewi&s;e pre&s;ented an atte&s;ted copy of the prote&s;tation made by the earls of Huntley and Argyle, charging Murray and Morton as the contrivers of the king's murder.</P>

<P>The duke of Norfolk, a nobleman of an amiable character, who had ever been zealous for Mary's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England, was &s;o &s;candalized at this renunciation, and apprehen&s;ive of its being u&s;ed to the pre|judice of the Scotti&s;h queen, that he contrived an expedient for putting a &s;top at once to the proceedings. He contracted a frien&s;hip with the regent; and, in a private conference, repre&s;ented the di&s;grace and injury that would accrue to him and his nation, as well as to the young prince, from this accu&s;ation of his mother. He gave him to under&s;tand that queen Elizabeth would not de|termine
<PB N="33" REF="350">
either for or again&s;t the queen of Scots, whether &s;he &s;hould be found innocent or guilty; and he advi&s;ed him to demand, at their next meeting, whether or not the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners had authority to pronounce a defi|nitive &s;entence, in ca&s;e of conviction. Murray, who began to fear, not only that he &s;hould fail in his endeavours to give an air of probability to his alle|gations, but al&s;o that Mary's agents would retort the guilt upon his own head, re&s;olved to comply with the duke's advice; and next day, when he was called upon to produce his evidence again&s;t Mary, he de&s;ired to know whether they had power to pronounce the Scotti&s;h queen guilty, or not guilty; whether, in ca&s;e of her conviction, &s;he &s;hould be delivered into his hands, or detained in England; and whether or not queen Elizabeth would maintain the authority of the young king, and his own regency. When the commi&s;&s;ioners an&s;wered they had no<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> &s;uch power, but the queen's royal word was &s;ufficient, Murray refu&s;ed to proceed, until he &s;hould &s;ee the queen's hand and &s;eal for the performance of what he required; and this demur produced a delay, during which the duke<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keith.</NOTE> of Norfolk and the regent agreed that this la&s;t &s;hould not accu&s;e queen Mary; that the duke &s;hould re&s;tore Murray to the queen's favour, and obtain her confirmation of his regency; and that the&s;e two new friends &s;hould labour jointly for the good of both nations. Elizabeth, without taking the lea&s;t no|tice<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil.</NOTE> of Murray's demands, evoked the whole affair to London, and con&s;titu|ted a new commi&s;&s;ion, from which the duke of Norfolk was excluded, becau&s;e the Scotti&s;h deputies repre&s;ented him as a favourer of Mary, who entertained thoughts of marrying that prince&s;s. She had been conveyed from Carlile to Bolton, in Lanca&s;hire; but this county being full of Roman catholics, who might rai&s;e a rebellion in her favour, &s;he was now, at the reque&s;t of her ac|cu&s;ers, removed to the ca&s;tle of Tutbury, in Stafford&s;hire, and committed to the charge of the earl of Shrew&s;bury. The duke of Norfolk had found means to make Mary acquainted with what had pa&s;&s;ed between him and Mur|ray; and &s;he communicated the tran&s;action to one of her confidents, who was a &s;py employed by Morton, to whom it was immediately imparted. He forthwith di&s;covered it to the earl of Leice&s;ter, who dur&s;t not conceal it from the queen; and &s;he was incen&s;ed again&s;t Norfolk, who candidly owned the corre&s;pondence, and declared his zeal for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of young James to the throne of England; while Morton was exa&s;perated again&s;t the regent for having taken &s;uch a &s;tep without his privity and concurrence.</P>

<P>Murray wanted to return to Scotland, on pretence of a &s;cheme which he &s;aid the earl of Argyle had formed for &s;urprizing the ca&s;tle of Stir|ling, in which the prince re&s;ided: but now the real cau&s;e of his backwardne&s;s to proceed in the accu&s;ation being di&s;covered, he was importuned in &s;uch a manner by his own colleagues, who reproached him with his falling off, and &s;o artfully cajoled by the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, that he at length, with an ap|pearance of reluctance, exhibited his charge, containing the pretended con|fe&s;&s;ions of Dalglei&s;h, and tho&s;e whom he had put to death as acce&s;&s;ary to the king's murder; the queen's extorted re&s;ignation of the crown; the decrees of his own faction a&s;&s;embled in parliament, and &s;ome copies of letters and ver&s;es, without date or &s;ub&s;cription, &s;aid to be written by the queen's own hand to Bothwell, and found in a box given by Sir James Balfour, governor of the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, to Bothwell's dome&s;tic Dalglei&s;h, upon whom it was

It contained a mo&s;t virulent accu&s;ation of the queen's conduct, founded upon fal&s;e and malicious mi&s;repre&s;entations, and the pretended con|fe&s;&s;ion of &s;ome unhappy people who were executed as acce&s;&s;aries to the king's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> murder.</P>

<P>Elizabeth, although plea&s;ed with the&s;e calumnies, which &s;tained the character of her rival, could not help de&s;pi&s;ing and dete&s;ting the authors of &s;uch treachery and &s;lander. She even wrote a letter to Mary, comforting her in her affliction, declaring &s;he believed the accu&s;ation was fal&s;e and ma|licious, and exhorting her to be patient under her gentle confinement, where &s;he was nearer the crown of England, than &s;he would have been in her own country. Notwith&s;tanding this profe&s;&s;ion of friend&s;hip, &s;he payed no regard to the remon&s;trances of Mary's commi&s;&s;ioners, who de&s;ired, in her name, that &s;he might be heard in per&s;on before the Engli&s;h nobility, and the amba&s;&s;adors of foreign princes; in which ca&s;e, &s;he did not doubt of being able to clear her own innocence, and prove the guilt of her adver&s;aries. Perceiving &s;he had nothing to hope from the impartiality of Elizabeth, who treated her &s;o cruelly, &s;he inhibited her commi&s;&s;ioners from proceeding farther in what re|lated to the difference between her and her rebellious &s;ubjects of Scotland. The commi&s;&s;ion for hearing the cau&s;e was di&s;&s;olved; but the queen of England did not think proper to pronounce any &s;entence. Before a &s;top was put to the proceedings, the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s delivered to the council a me&s;&s;age from his mi&s;tre&s;s to queen Elizabeth, importing, that &s;hould &s;he be ad|mitted to the pre&s;ence of her good &s;i&s;ter, as her adver&s;aries had been, &s;he would undertake not only to vindicate her own character from their a&s;per&s;ions, but even to prove that they them&s;elves were the authors of that murder which<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1569.</NOTE> they had laid to her charge. The accu&s;ers were not a little &s;tartled at this de|claration; and lord Patrick Lind&s;ay &s;ent a per&s;on to give lord Herries the lie, and challenge him to &s;ingle combat, &s;hould he charge him with the king's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Le&s;ley's Ne|gotiations.</NOTE> murder. Herries replied, that he did not charge Lind&s;ay in particular; but the names of the guilty &s;hould be &s;pecified in proper time; and then, if Lind|&s;ay would undertake their defence, he (Herries) &s;hould be ready to accept his challenge. The bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s per&s;i&s;ted in his propo&s;al, and demanded a copy of the proce&s;s and allegations produced again&s;t his mi&s;tre&s;s, that &s;he might know how to frame her an&s;wers; but the council excu&s;ed them&s;elves from complying with the&s;e demands. M. de la Mothe Fenelon, the French amba&s;&s;ador, interpo&s;ed in her behalf, and importuned Elizabeth and her mini|&s;ters to grant Mary's reque&s;t; but he was amu&s;ed with eva&s;ive an&s;wers, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil.</NOTE> general profe&s;&s;ions of Elizabeth's good will towards her gentle &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<P>By this time Murray, through the mediation of Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, and &s;ecretary Lidington, was admitted again into the favour of the duke of Norfolk, who communicated his intention of marrying the queen of Scots, and effecting a match between young James and his only daughter Margaret. He likewi&s;e became bond&s;man to Elizabeth, for two thou&s;and
<PB N="35" REF="370">
pounds lent to the regent, which he was afterwards obliged to pay. He made Mary acquainted with this new bond of friend&s;hip; and, as he had, in the fir&s;t emotions of his re&s;entment, engaged the earl of We&s;tmoreland to cut off the regent in his return to Scotland, he now de&s;ired that nobleman to let him pa&s;s unmole&s;ted. In return for all this genero&s;ity, the per&s;idious Murray be|trayed the corre&s;pondence to Elizabeth, who engaged in a verbal league with the traitor, for the defence of the young prince, and the maintenance of his own admini&s;tration. She accommodated him with the loan of five thou&s;and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.</NOTE> pounds, promi&s;ed to &s;upply him with three times the &s;um, and permitted him to retire into Scotland. Before his departure from London, the duke de Chateleraud arrived in that city from France, where he had re&s;ided during the late troubles in his own country, and demanded of the Engli&s;h court that Murray &s;hould be degraded from the regency, on account of his &s;purious birth, and ambitious practices. He told Elizabeth, that &s;hould the regency be con|ferred upon him, to whom it of right belonged, according to the cu&s;tom of the country, he would &s;oon put an end to the civil war, and re&s;tore his &s;overeign, without blood&s;hed. This propo&s;al was far from being agreeable to the queen of England, who declared &s;he would oppo&s;e him by force of arms, &s;hould he pretend to any &s;hare in the admini&s;tration, or refu&s;e to acknowledge the young prince's authority. She would not even allow him to &s;ee his captive mi&s;tre&s;s at Tutbury; but cau&s;ed him to be detained at York, until he was relea&s;ed, at the in&s;tances of Mary and the French amba&s;&s;ador. When he returned to Scot|land with the lord Herries, and the commendator of Kilwinning, he rai&s;ed &s;ome forces, by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion from his &s;overeign: but in a confe|rence held at Edinburgh, with Murray and his parti&s;ans, touching a pacifi|cation, he was arre&s;ted, and, with the lord Herries, committed pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawford.</NOTE></P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the court of France, notwith&s;tanding the late accommodation with the Huguenots, formed the de&s;ign of &s;urpri&s;ing the prince of Cond&eacute; in his own hou&s;e; but he received intimation of the &s;cheme, and e&s;caped to Rochelle. Then the king forbade the exerci&s;e of the prote&s;tant religion, and bani&s;hed all the mini&s;ters who preached up that doc|trine. The per&s;ecution raged at the &s;ame time in the Low Countries; and the prince of Orange was obliged to take refuge among the French Hugue|nots, whom Elizabeth &s;uccoured with a &s;upply of one hundred thou&s;and crowns, and a fine train of artillery. A great number of Flemi&s;h families re|moved<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> to England, and &s;ettling under the queen's protection, in different parts of the kingdom, contributed greatly to the improvement of commerce. To|wards the latter end of the la&s;t year, &s;ome Bi&s;cayan ve&s;&s;els being taken by French pirates, who carried them into Engli&s;h harbours, Elizabeth under|&s;tanding that there was a con&s;iderable &s;um of money on board, for the u&s;e of the duke of Alva, who was the great enemy of the prote&s;tants in the Low-Countries, &s;eized it for her own purpo&s;es, by way of loan, and gave &s;ecurity to the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador for the payment. The duke of Alva demanding it in a peremptory manner, and receiving nothing but eva&s;ive an&s;wers, cau&s;ed all the Engli&s;h merchants in the Netherlands to be arre&s;ted, and &s;eized upon their ef|fects. Elizabeth retorted this act of ho&s;tility upon the Flemings in Eng|land, and publi&s;hed a proclamation on this &s;ubject, which was an&s;wered by
<PB N="36" REF="380">
the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, who likewi&s;e circulated &s;candalous libels, which af|fected the queen's reputation. She ordered him to be put under a guard for two days, and complained of his in&s;olence to Philip; from whom, however, &s;he received no &s;atisfaction. This quarrel having interrupted all commerce between England and the Low-Countries, the Engli&s;h merchants &s;ent their commodities to Hamburgh; and the duke of Alva not only forbade all com|munication between the Flemings and Elizabeth's &s;ubjects, but appointed &s;pies to inform him of whatever &s;hould be tran&s;acted contrary to this prohibition. Among the&s;e was an Engli&s;h papi&s;t called Story, who had been a violent per|&s;ecutor in the reign of Mary, and taken refuge in the Low-Countries, at Elizabeth's acce&s;&s;ion. He was now extremely active again&s;t his countrymen, till at length being decoyed on board of a ve&s;&s;el, &s;aid to be loaded with contra|band goods, he was brought over to England, and afterwards executed for trea&s;on. Mean while the Engli&s;h &s;hips in Spain were confi&s;cated, and the crews either confined in the inqui&s;ition, or &s;ent to the gallies. Philip prohibited the im|portation of oil, allom, &s;ugar, and aromatics, from his dominions into Eng|land; and tampered with the duke of Norfolk and the earl of Ormond to excite dome&s;tic di&s;turbances: but they rejected his propo&s;als, and di&s;covered his de&s;igns to their &s;overeign, who granted letters of marque again&s;t the &s;ub|jects of Philip, until &s;uch a number of prizes were taken, that &s;he found it nece&s;&s;ary to recall the commi&s;&s;ioners, rather than involve her&s;elf in a war for which &s;he was not provided.</P>

<P>At this period, a &s;torm was brewed again&s;t Cecil, by the duke of Norfolk, the marquis of Northampton, and the earls of Arundel and Pembroke. They re&s;ented his great influence in the council; and, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that his de&s;ign was to interrupt the advantageous commerce with the Low-Coun|tries, and engage the nation in an expen&s;ive war with a powerful enemy, they re&s;olved to call him to account for his evil admini&s;tration, and the fal&s;hoods by which they affirmed he had mi&s;led her maje&s;ty. They were even joined by the earl of Leice&s;ter, who complained to the queen of Cecil's management; but he met with a very cold reception from Elizabeth, who e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of Cecil, becau&s;e he had always flattered her private animo&s;ity again&s;t the queen of Scotland. The earl of Murray, in his return to Scotland, had &s;ent Sir Robert Melvil to Mary, with prote&s;tations of the mo&s;t dutiful regard, and a propo&s;al of marriage between her and the duke of Norfolk, which could not but be agreeable to queen Elizabeth, as well as to her own &s;ubjects, and be attended with her immediate re&s;toration. To this me&s;&s;age he received a fa|vourable an&s;wer from his mi&s;tre&s;s, who confided in his &s;incerity, which had been vouched by Norfolk; and &s;he not only &s;ent orders to Chateleraud, Ar|gyle, and Huntley, to di&s;mi&s;s the forces they had rai&s;ed again&s;t the regent; but al&s;o furni&s;hed lord Herries with in&s;tructions to accommodate matters with him in a private treaty. Elizabeth, with whom Murray corre&s;ponded, had begun a treaty for the relea&s;e and re&s;toration of Mary, with mon&s;ieur de Fe|nelon and the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, who acted as the amba&s;&s;ador of the captive prince&s;s. This prelate pre&s;ented articles to the council, which were deemed not unrea&s;onable, though &s;ome few alterations were made. To the&s;e Mary took no exceptions; but &s;he de&s;ired time to procure the approbation of the French king, without which her friends in Scotland would not agree to the

treaty. In this interval, her Engli&s;h parti&s;ans, at the head of whom were the earls of Leice&s;ter, Arundel, and Pembroke, &s;ent Mr. Candi&s;h to Mary, with a letter recommending Norfolk to her as an hu&s;band, and a&s;&s;uring her of their attachment and a&s;&s;i&s;tance touching her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England. When &s;he accepted of their recommendation in good part, they &s;ecured the approbation of the earls of Derby, Su&s;&s;ex, Northumberland, We&s;tmoreland, and Cumberland: the duke of Norfolk pro&s;ecuted his &s;uit with Mary by let|ters, me&s;&s;ages, and tokens; the French amba&s;&s;ador obtained the con&s;ent of his ma&s;ter, of the duke and dutche&s;s, and cardinal of Lorrain; and Mary<NOTE PLACE="marg">Le&s;ley's Ne|gotiat. ex An|der&s;on.</NOTE> &s;igned the contract, which was depo&s;ited in the hands of mon&s;ieur de Fe|nelon.</P>

<P>Mean while the public treaty between Elizabeth and the Scotti&s;h queen was interrupted by the mutual jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t of the parties. Mary &s;u&s;|pected Elizabeth of a de&s;ign to &s;ecure the per&s;on of her &s;on, together with &s;ome of the fortre&s;&s;es in Scotland. Her couriers had been intercepted, and her letters &s;eized upon the Engli&s;h border, while tho&s;e of her adver&s;aries pa&s;&s;ed to and fro unmole&s;ted. On the other hand, the queen of England dreaded Mary's intriguing with the kings of France and Spain, in con&s;equence of the league of Bayonne, formed for the de&s;truction of the prote&s;tant religion. She apprehended a double inva&s;ion from France and Flanders; and pretended to have received intimation that Mary had ceded her preten&s;ions to the crown of England, in favour of the duke of Anjou, whom &s;he propo&s;ed to marry. The Scotti&s;h queen not only denied this ce&s;&s;ion and purpo&s;ed alliance, but even procured a declaration from the French king, the queen-mother, the duke of Anjou, and the cardinal of Lorraine, importing that no &s;uch ce&s;&s;ion had ever been made or intended. Then the French amba&s;&s;ador Fenelon, and the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, in&s;i&s;ting upon the performance of Elizabeth's promi&s;e to relea&s;e and re&s;tore queen Mary, &s;he delayed giving her final an&s;wer, until &s;he &s;hould have con&s;idered this declaration; and afterwards craved longer re&s;pite, until &s;he could hear from the earl of Murray. She accordingly received let|ters from that nobleman, intimating that the e&s;tates of Scotland would not con&s;ent to their queen's re&s;toration upon any terms what&s;oever; and making her acquainted with the progre&s;s of the projected match between Mary and the duke of Norfolk.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="52" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; LII.</HEAD>
<P>Elizabeth was equally chagrined and perplexed at this intelligence. She wi&s;hed that Mary was removed from her dominions, where &s;he acquired new intere&s;t every day; and &s;he could not bear the thoughts of relea&s;ing that dete&s;ted rival, who might join her enemies and endanger her royalty. Lei|ce&s;ter, who attended the queen in her progre&s;s, pretended to be taken ill at Titchfield; and, when the queen vi&s;ited him in his apartment, he, in con&s;e|quence of the mea&s;ures he had taken with his confederates, di&s;clo&s;ed to her the whole de&s;ign of the marriage. On all other emergencies, &s;he could di&s;|&s;emble her &s;entiments; but, when Mary was the &s;ubject of the di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he could not command her temper. Even in pre&s;ence of foreign amba&s;&s;adors, her pa&s;&s;ion &s;ometimes vented it&s;elf in very indecent terms. On this occa&s;ion &s;he &s;tormed with extraordinary violence. Arundel and Pembroke had retired from court; but Norfolk was loaded with reproach, for pre&s;uming to treat of &s;uch an alliance without her knowledge, and ordered to de&s;i&s;t from the pur&s;uit, on
<PB N="38" REF="400">
pain of her highe&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure. He retired abrubtly from the court at South|ampton to London, where, being appri&s;ed of the queen's menaces, he re|paired to his hou&s;e of Kenninghall in Norfolk. He was &s;o much beloved in that country, that he could have a&s;&s;embled a con&s;idarable army in his own defence: but he piqued him&s;elf upon his loyalty, and quietly accompanied a lieutenant of the band of pen&s;ioners, who was &s;ent to bring him up to London. He was confined at Burnham near Wind&s;or, where he underwent divers exami|nations touching the marriage: his coffers were &s;earched, his papers &s;eized, and then the queen committed him pri&s;oner to the Tower of London. Lei|ce&s;ter, after an examination, obtained his pardon. Pembroke, Arundel, and Lumley, were confined to their hou&s;es; Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, and Ro|bert Ridolphi a Florentine merchant, were impri&s;oned; the earls of Nor|thumberland and We&s;tmoreland made their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the earl of Su&s;&s;ex, lieutenant of the northern Marches. All the&s;e noblemen, as well as the bi&s;hop<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> of Ro&s;s, agreed in declaring that the marriage had been propo&s;ed by the earl of Murray; and that neither the queen of Scots nor they would have con|cluded the match without the knowledge and con&s;ent of Elizabeth.</P>

<P>The queen did not think proper to declare all &s;he knew relating to this confederacy: but hearing that a de&s;ign was formed for the e&s;cape of Mary from Winkfield, &s;he i&s;&s;ued orders for removing that prince&s;s to Tutbury, where &s;he was clo&s;e confined, under the joint charge of the earls of Shrew&s;|bury and Huntingdon; notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trance of the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, who repre&s;ented the inju&s;tice of putting the per&s;on of his mi&s;tre&s;s in the hands of the earl of Huntingdon, he, as a pretender to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, having an intere&s;t in her death. The &s;cheme for her e&s;cape was projected by Leonard Dacres, uncle to the lord Dacres of Gille&s;land, who undertook to conduct her &s;afely into Scotland. But, when &s;he communicated this de&s;ign to the duke of Norfolk, he oppo&s;ed it with all his influence, fearing that &s;hould &s;he e&s;cape by means of the papi&s;ts, they would di&s;&s;uade her from marrying him who was a prote&s;tant, and promote a match between her and Don John of Au&s;tria, which had been propo&s;ed by Philip king of Spain. This plot mi&s;carrying, Mary &s;ollicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the duke of Alva towards her deliverance; and that nobleman promi&s;ed to &s;upply her with a body of forces, and a &s;um of<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Ne|gotiations.</NOTE> money, to &s;upport any in&s;urrection that &s;hould be rai&s;ed in her favour. But this expedient was declined by her Engli&s;h friends, who declared, that whatever inclination they had to relea&s;e her from captivity, and &s;ettle her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, they would never a&s;&s;i&s;t the Spaniards in making a conque&s;t of their country. Neverthele&s;s, the duke of Alva a&s;&s;embled a body of forces, to be tran&s;ported to England, in ca&s;e of any di&s;turbance. La Mothe, governor of Dunkirk, was &s;ent to found the Engli&s;h harbours, in the di&s;gui&s;e of a &s;ailor; and the marquis of Cetona was di&s;patched to London, in the character of a public mini&s;ter, on pretence of demanding the money which Elizabeth had in|tercepted, and compromi&s;ing the differences between the two nations; though his real errand was to watch the progre&s;s of the expected rebellion, and take the command of the Spani&s;h forces on their arrival from the Netherlands.</P>

<P>The malecontents of the north were certainly ripe for revolt. The earl of Northumberland, a bigotted Roman catholic, had been exa&s;perated by the queen's &s;eizing a copper mine which was found on his e&s;tate. He and
<PB N="39" REF="410">
We&s;tmoreland had been concerned in the &s;cheme of Norfolk's marriage with the queen of Scots; and though they had excu&s;ed them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner as to &s;atisfy the earl of Su&s;&s;ex, they were &s;till &s;u&s;pected by Elizabeth, who had re|ceived &s;ome dark hints of an intended rebellion. She &s;ent an herald to &s;um|mon the two earls to appear at court, on pain of being deemed rebels: but, before they received this citation, the earl of Northumberland was be&s;et in his hou&s;e by &s;ome gentlemen of the country, who re&s;olved to &s;ignalize their loyalty on this occa&s;ion. He found means, however, to make his e&s;cape to Brance|path, the &s;eat of the earl of We&s;tmoreland, where the Roman catholics flocked to them in great numbers, and pre&s;&s;ed them to take arms in their own defence. Thus &s;timulated, they publi&s;hed a proclamation, declaring their de&s;ign was to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the catholic religion: but this was &s;oon followed by another mani|fe&s;to, in which they pretended their motive for taking arms was to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown, and prevent the de&s;truction of the antient nobility. They di&s;patched an officer to Bru&s;&s;els, to implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the duke of Alva; but they had engaged in the rebellion &s;o precipitately, that he had not provided ve&s;&s;els for tran&s;porting his troops, and he li&s;tened to their &s;ollicita|tions with great coldne&s;s and indifference. In the mean time, the in&s;urgents entering Durham, cau&s;ed the Bible and book of Common Prayer to be torn in public, a crucifix to be erected in the cathedral, and ma&s;s to be &s;olemnly celebrated. They propo&s;ed to &s;eize York and Newca&s;tle; but were prevented by the vigilance of the earl of Su&s;&s;ex. Their numbers daily increa&s;ing, they detached five hundred hor&s;e to relea&s;e the queen of Scots; but, before their ar|rival, &s;he was removed to Coventry. Then they reduced Bernard-ca&s;tle, and fortified Hartlepool. Their army now amounting to eighteen thou&s;and men, they made excur&s;ions to the gates of York, in which the earl of Su&s;&s;ex, the lord Hun&s;don, and the mar&s;hal of Berwick, were &s;hut up with five thou|&s;and men, who could not pretend to keep the field again&s;t &s;uch numbers: but, as they were de&s;titute of money, they neither could pro&s;ecute their &s;cheme of marching to London, nor keep their forces together. A con&s;iderable de&s;er|tion en&s;ued among their troops; notwith&s;tanding which, they made a &s;hift to maintain their ground, until Su&s;&s;ex was reinforced with a &s;trong body of forces, rai&s;ed by Sir George Bowes in the palatinate of Durham; and the earl of Warwick, with the lord admiral Clinton, approached at the head of an|other army, levied in the midland counties. Then the rebels being intimi|dated, retired to Hexham, and from thence to Naworth in Cumberland, where they di&s;per&s;ed. The two chiefs, with the principal gentlemen, and five hun|dred hor&s;e, took refuge in Scotland, where Northumberland was apprehended<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strype. Camden. Fenelon.</NOTE> by the regent, and &s;ent pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle of Lochlevin; but the earl of We&s;tmoreland e&s;caped to Flanders.</P>

<P>The in&s;urrection being thus &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, Elizabeth affected to laugh at it as a ridiculous enterprize, while the earl of Su&s;&s;ex, and Sir George Bowes, cau&s;ed a great number of the in&s;urgents to be tried by martial law, and hanged in different places. Leonard Dacres had rai&s;ed three thou&s;and men, on pre|tence of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the government; but he privately encouraged the rebels with a promi&s;e of joining them, after he &s;hould have cut off the lord Scroop, warden of the we&s;tern Marches, and the bi&s;hop of Carlile. Finding him&s;elf, however, unequal to this enterprize, he &s;urprized the ca&s;tles of Grey&s;toke, Naworth,
<PB N="40" REF="420">
and other hou&s;es belonging to the Dacres family, as his right of inheritance, tho' they were in effect the property of his two nieces, contracted to the &s;ons of the duke of Norfolk their father-in-law. As he had now pulled off the ma&s;que, and appeared a declared rebel, the lord Hun&s;don marched again&s;t him with the garri&s;on-troops of Berwick; and Leonard meeting him at the little river Gelt, was defeated after a very ob&s;tinate engagement. He retired to the neare&s;t part of Scotland, from whence he was conveyed to Holland, and ended his days mi&s;erably at Louvain.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of the war that &s;till raged between the French mini&s;try and the Huguenots, the prince of Cond&eacute; was &s;lain in the battle of Jarnac; and the admiral receiving a reinforcement of Germans under count Mansfeldt, engaged the king's troops at Montcontour, where he was defeated. Then he demanded &s;uccours of Elizabeth, who lent him &s;ome money, on the jewels of the queen of Navarre, and permitted a company of Engli&s;h gentlemen to &s;erve as volunteers in his army: but, notwith&s;tanding all his efforts, the king made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of St. Jean d'Angely; with the conque&s;t of which the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezerai.</NOTE> campaign ended. In the Low-Countries, the duke of Alva e&s;tabli&s;hed the inqui&s;ition, and &s;eized, in behalf of the king, all the privileges of the towns, univer&s;ities, and provinces. He laid grievous impo&s;itions on the people: tho&s;e who pre&s;umed to complain were &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed: in a word, the provinces<NOTE PLACE="marg">G$otius.</NOTE> were treated as a conquered country, and the &s;ubjects driven to de&s;pair.</P>

<P>Queen Elizabeth had engaged in a treaty with the regent of Scot|land, obliging her&s;elf to deliver Mary into his hands, on condition of his &s;ur|rendering &s;ome of the Scotti&s;h fortre&s;&s;es, and the per&s;on of the young prince, to the queen of England: but the execution of this treaty was prevented by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 15$0.</NOTE> the northern in&s;urrection. Murray having &s;eized the per&s;on of Northumber|land, &s;ent Sir Nicholas Elphin&s;ton to London, to propo&s;e that queen Mary &s;hould be exchanged for this nobleman, and &s;ome Scotti&s;h ho&s;tages as a &s;e|curity for Murray's adhering to the intere&s;t of England, in ca&s;e of a war be|tween France and Elizabeth. This &s;cheme being vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, Murray accu&s;ed him of having maintained intelligence with the rebels; and he was committed pri&s;oner to London-hou&s;e, where he remained<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fenelon.</NOTE> four months in cu&s;tody of the bi&s;hop. The propo&s;al of Murray was debated in council, and all the members being enemies to the Scotti&s;h queen, it was favourably received; but the effect of their deliberation was prevented by the death of the regent, who, in pa&s;&s;ing through Linlithgow, was &s;hot by James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh, who had been forfeited after the battle of Lang&s;ide.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawford.</NOTE> The e&s;tate of his wife, who was an heire&s;s, Murray gave away to one of his favourites; and the officers who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion acted with &s;uch inhumanity as<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buchanan.</NOTE> deprived the unhappy woman of her &s;en&s;es.

Elizabeth was tran&s;ported to an exce&s;s of grief, when &s;he received the tidings of Murray's death.

<PB N="41" REF="430">
having an audience at this juncture, the queen complained of Mary's practices with the earl of Northumberland; &s;aid &s;he was not obliged to give an account of her actions to any per&s;on upon earth; that the queen of Scots &s;hould be tenderly treated; and with re&s;pect to her being &s;et at liberty, &s;he (Elizabeth) would &s;ignify her re&s;olution to the French king by her own amba&s;&s;ador. Im|mediately<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fenelon.</NOTE> after Murray's death, Thomas Carr of Ferniher&s;t, and Walter Scot of Buccleugh, &s;taunch adherents to Mary, a&s;&s;embled a number of borderers, and joining the Engli&s;h rebels, laid wa&s;te the frontiers with fire and &s;word. Elizabeth, who would let &s;lip no opportunity of maintaining the civil war in Scotland, di&s;patched Thomas Randolph with complaints of this outrage to the a&s;&s;embled &s;tates of Scotland, and with intimation that if they could not &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e di&s;turbers of the peace, on account of the di&s;orders of their kingdom, &s;he would &s;end forces to cha&s;ti&s;e the offenders. In the mean time, &s;he ordered the earl of Su&s;&s;ex to rai&s;e an army, and invade Scotland, on pre|tence of puni&s;hing Carr and Scot, though her real de&s;ign was to foment the troubles of Scotland. The laird of Grange, who commanded in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, had &s;et at liberty the duke of Chateleraud, lord Herries, and others of the queen's party, who had been confined by Murray in that fortre&s;s; and the chiefs of the two factions engaged in a negotiation, on pretence of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the peace of the kingdom; though nothing was farther from their thoughts than a coalition for the good of their country. Mary's parti|&s;ans expected a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the king of France, and the duke of Alva; and the other party, headed by Morton, depended upon the protection of Eliza|beth. When Huntley and Argyle heard of her preparations, they endeavoured to divert her from her purpo&s;e, by demanding a truce, which &s;he refu&s;ed.</P>

<P>In the month of April, the earl of Su&s;&s;ex, with the lord Hun&s;don, and Drury, mar&s;hal of Berwick, entered Scotland at the head of an army, ravaged the lands of Ferniher&s;t and Buccleugh, burned above three hundred hou&s;es, and fifty ca&s;tles; and garri&s;oned Home and Fa&s;tca&s;tle, belonging to lord Home, who had hitherto ob&s;erved a kind of neutrality. The e&s;tates of Scotland a&s;&s;embling in the beginning of May, deputed Robert Ritcairn to conciliate the favour of Elizabeth, and a&s;&s;ure her they were di&s;po&s;ed to elect &s;uch a re|gent as &s;hould be agreeable to her inclination. This a&s;&s;embly, however, was compo&s;ed of Mary's enemies. Tho&s;e who adhered to that unfortunate prin|ce&s;s, convened in the we&s;t, and attacked the ca&s;tle of Gla&s;gow, that it might not &s;erve as a retreat or fortre&s;s to the earl of Lennox, who was expected from England, where he had for &s;ome time re&s;ided. The place was vigorou&s;ly de|fended by the friends of that earl, until Su&s;&s;ex &s;ent Drury to its relief. The be&s;iegers retiring at his approach, he joined a party of the Scots who were aver&s;e to Mary, ravaged the lands of the Hamiltons, and took the ca&s;tle of that name, plundering and burning the adjacent country. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Pitcairn returned with Elizabeth's an&s;wer to the e&s;tates, propo&s;ing a conference for an accommodation between the two parties; in which ca&s;e, &s;he offered her&s;elf as mediatrix; and &s;he de&s;ired they would po&s;tpone the election of regent, until they &s;hould &s;ee the &s;ucce&s;s of that expedient: but, as the na|tion could not be governed without a chief, they cho&s;e the earl of Lennox lieutenant or interrex; and he was afterwards confirmed regent, with the ap|probation of Elizabeth, who knew he would not venture to act contrary to
<PB N="42" REF="440">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> her inclination, while his wife remained as an ho&s;tage in England. The duke of Alva, by order of Philip, &s;ent a &s;upply of arms and ammunition to the duke of Chateleraud, the earls of Huntley and Argyle, who acted as Mary's lieutenants in Scotland; &s;o that they were enabled to take the field, and Huntley fortified the ca&s;tle of Brechin, which, however, was &s;oon re|duced by the regent. They at this juncture di&s;patched lord Seaton, as their queen's amba&s;&s;ador, to the duke of Alva, whom they &s;ollicited for further a&s;|&s;i&s;tance in troops and money; and he amu&s;ed them with fair promi&s;es, while a truce was concluded in Scotland, at the de&s;ire of Elizabeth.</P>

<P>The bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s having recovered his liberty, &s;till laboured for the relea&s;e of his &s;overeign; and the French and Spani&s;h monarchs ordered their amba&s;&s;adors to join him in his remon&s;trances to the court of England. Elizabeth's hatred to the queen of Scots was now become habitual: &s;he im|puted all the dangers and di&s;quiets &s;he had undergone &s;ince her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, to the i$l offices of Mary and her adherents; and &s;he was in parti|cular irritated by the conduct of pope Pius V. who, without any previous ad|monition or citation, i&s;&s;ued a private bull again&s;t her and her heretical adhe|rents, excommunicating her&s;elf, ab&s;olving her &s;ubjects from their oath of al|legiance, and denouncing an anathema again&s;t all who &s;hould yield her obe|dience. This bull was fixed on the gate of the bi&s;hop's palace in London, by one Felton, who being detected and apprehended, gloried in the fact, and was hanged for his officiou&s;ne&s;s. The &s;ame puni&s;hment was inflicted upon John Throgmorton, and two other per&s;ons, who formed a &s;cheme to &s;et the duke of Norfolk at liberty, by a&s;&s;embling forces at Hurle&s;ton fair. That nobleman owning he had been guilty of indi&s;cretion$ and giving bend and &s;ecurity that he would proceed no farther in the marriage between him and Mary, without his queen's con&s;ent, was relea&s;ed from the Tower, and permitted to re&s;ide in his own hou&s;e, under the eye of Sir Humphrey Nevil. About the &s;ame $ime Thomas and Edward Stanley, &s;ons to the earl of Derby, together with Tho|mas Gerard, Roll&s;ton, Hall, and other natives of Derby&s;hire, contrived a &s;cheme for delivering the queen of Scots; but this being di&s;covered by Roll|&s;ton's &s;on, who was one of the band of pen&s;ioners, the con&s;pirators were im|pri&s;oned before they could execute their re&s;olution.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e provocations, Elizabeth con&s;ented to the re|newal of the treaty for the Scotti&s;h queen's relea&s;e and re&s;toration: but the true motive of this conde&s;cen&s;ion was her apprehen&s;ion from France, where a peace was likely to en&s;ue between the king and the Huguenots. In that ca&s;e, &s;he knew Charles would be more at liberty to take effectual mea&s;ures for the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the captive queen: &s;he knew he was well di&s;po&s;ed towards that prin|ce&s;s; and, in order to amu&s;e him, &s;he con&s;ented to a renewal of the negotia|tion, though &s;he was determined again&s;t &s;etting Mary at liberty. She affected great good humour and affection for her kin&s;woman, favoured the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s with a mo&s;t gracious reception, and &s;ent by him certain propo&s;als to his mi&s;tre&s;s, who forthwith di&s;patched the lord Living&s;ton to communicate them to her friends in Scotland. That nobleman, after having been detained twenty days at Alnwick by the earl of Su&s;&s;ex, who had returned from his Scotti&s;h expedition, at length found the queen's lieutenants, with &s;ome other noble|men of her party, at Strathtay in Athol, where they con&s;idered the articles,
<PB N="43" REF="450">
and appointed deputies to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the treaty in London. Mean while Eliza|beth<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> pretending to have received intimation that a body of troops was ready to embark in France for Scotland, &s;he ordered admiral Clinton to put to &s;ea with a &s;quadron of &s;hips of war, and the earl of Su&s;&s;ex to re-enter Scotland, where he ravaged Annandale with fire and &s;word, until the queen's lieutenants, Chateleraud, Huntley, and Argyle, obliged them&s;elves by bond to ab&s;tain from all acts of ho&s;tility again&s;t the Engli&s;h: then he returned to England, and was appointed one of the queen's privy council. Fenelon a&s;&s;uring Eli|zabeth<NOTE PLACE="marg">$ene$on.</NOTE> that the report of the French armament was entirely without founda|tion, &s;he revoked her order to the admiral, received with uncommon civility M. de Joigny, whom the French king had &s;ent over to pre&s;s the conclu&s;ion of the treaty, and declared her re&s;olution to re&s;tore her dear cou&s;in. Neverthe|le&s;s, when &s;he heard the peace between Charles and the Huguenots was con|cluded, and that &s;ome of the articles were kept &s;ecret, &s;he &s;ent Sir Francis Wal&s;ingham to the French court, on pretence of a&s;&s;uring the king of her good will towards Mary; but he had in&s;tructions to learn the tenour of tho&s;e private articles; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;cover the real intention of Charles with regard to the queen of Scotland. At the &s;ame time &s;he &s;ent Sir Henry Cob|ham to Bru&s;&s;els, with compliments to Anne of Au&s;tria, daughter to the em|peror, who arrived in the Low Countries in her way to Spain, as a wife to Philip; and Howard, with a &s;quadron of &s;hips, e&s;corted this prince&s;s through the Engli&s;h channel. Cobham proceeded to the court of the emperor, to make him acquainted with the affairs of Scotland, the differences between England and the Low-Countries, to obtain his protection for the Engli&s;h merchants &s;ettled at Hamburgh, and endeavour to renew the negotiation for a match be|tween Elizabeth and his brother Charles; though &s;he certainly had no inten|$ion to conclude &s;uch an alliance. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jd.</NOTE></P>

<P>THE amba&s;&s;adors of Mary, France, and Spain, continuing &s;till to im|portune her on the &s;core of the treaty, &s;he appointed Cecil, and Sir Walter Mildmay chancellor of the exchequer, her commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the queen of Scots; and they accordingly &s;et out for Chatte&s;worth, where that prin|ce&s;s was confined. Wal&s;ingham returning from France immediately after their departure, a&s;&s;ured her that the French king was warmly attached to the intere&s;t of Mary; and he extolled the capacity of Charles in &s;uch a manner, that Eli|zabeth being afraid of embroiling her&s;elf with &s;uch an antagoni&s;t, di&s;patched an expre&s;s to Cecil, with orders to proceed in earne&s;t on the treaty. The mi|ni&s;ter thus in&s;tructed, offered the following propo&s;itions for effecting a la&s;t|ing peace between the two kingdoms: That the treaty of Edinburgh &s;hould be ratified: That Mary &s;hould renounce her claim to the crown of England, during the life of queen Elizabeth, and her heirs lawfully begotten: That &s;he &s;hould not enter into any confederacy again&s;t England; nor permit foreign forces to land in Scotland; nor maintain corre&s;pondence with the Engli&s;h or Iri&s;h, but with the knowledge of Elizabeth: That &s;he &s;hould deliver up the Engli&s;h fugi|tives who had taken refuge in Scotland, and repair the damage done to the Engli&s;h frontier: That &s;he &s;hould puni&s;h the murderers of her hu&s;band and the earl of Murray, and &s;end her &s;on to be educated in England: That &s;he &s;hould not marry an Engli&s;hman, without the con&s;ent of Elizabeth, nor any other per|&s;on, except &s;uch as &s;hould be approved by the e&s;tates of Scotland: That her &s;ubjects &s;hould not cro&s;s the &s;ea into Ireland, without permi&s;&s;ion from the queen of England: That this treaty &s;hould be &s;igned by Mary and her delegates: That, for the ratification of the articles, &s;ix ho&s;tages, to be named by Elizabeth,
<PB N="46" REF="480">
&s;hould be &s;ent into England: That Mary, by engaging in any attempt again&s;t the queen of England, &s;hould forfeit all title to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown: That Hume ca&s;tle and Fa&s;t ca&s;tle &s;hould remain three years in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, and &s;ome other fort in Galloway or Cantyre be delivered up to Eliza|beth, for preventing the Scots from infe&s;ting Ireland: and, la&s;tly, that the $$$ates of Scotland &s;hould ratify the&s;e articles by act of parliament. Queen Mary referred Cecil and Mildmay for an an&s;wer to the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s, her amba&s;&s;ador, the bi&s;hop of Galloway, who was uncle to the earl of Huntley, and William lord Leving&s;ton, delegates from her lieutenants in Scotland. The&s;e agreed to &s;ome of the articles, but refu&s;ed to renounce the antient league with France, becau&s;e the queen would lo&s;e her dowry, and the Scotti&s;h nation forfeit the valuable privileges they enjoyed in that kingdom. They promi&s;ed that no foreign troops &s;hould be admitted into Scotland, except in ca&s;e of a rebellion, which could not be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the dome&s;tic forces of the nation. That the queen of Scots &s;hould not maintain any corre&s;pondence with the &s;ub|jects of England to the prejudice of Elizabeth, provided this la&s;t would enter into the &s;ame engagement with re&s;pect to the &s;ubjects of Mary. They &s;aid they could not deliver the prince to Elizabeth, becau&s;e they were not ma&s;ters of his per&s;on. That the demand with re&s;pect to their queen's marriage was altogether<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> unrea&s;onable, con&s;idering &s;he was an independent prince&s;s. That the Scots &s;hould not mole&s;t Ireland, provided the Iri&s;h were prohibited from making de&s;cents on Scotland. That any ho&s;tages required &s;hould be given, except the duke of Chateleraud, the earls of Huntley, Argyle, and Athol. That Mary &s;hould forfeit her title to the crown of England, according to the propo&s;al on that &s;ubject, provided queen Elizabeth &s;hould be re&s;trained by the &s;ame penalty from attempting ought to the prejudice of the Scotti&s;h queen: but they ab&s;o|lutely in&s;i&s;ted on Elizabeth's re&s;toring Hume ca&s;tle and Fa&s;t ca&s;tle to the pro|prietor, and refu&s;ed to deliver any fortre&s;s either in Galloway or Cantyre into<NOTE PLACE="marg">Le&s;ley.</NOTE> the hands of a foreigner. After the&s;e articles had been debated twenty days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners returned, and made &s;uch a report to Elizabeth, that &s;he declared her&s;elf perfectly well &s;atisfied with the an&s;wers of the Scotti&s;h queen; and &s;aid &s;he did not doubt that the only difference remaining would be removed at the arrival of the commi&s;&s;ioners from the regent of Scotland, without who&s;e con&s;ent the young prince could not be conveyed to England.</P>

<P>In the mean time the propo&s;als and an&s;wers were by Mary communicated to the kings of France and Spain, with intimation, that &s;he &s;hould be obliged to &s;ubmit to the conditions, unle&s;s they would &s;end immediate &s;uccour to her friends in Scotland. But all &s;he reaped from this remon&s;trance was their interce&s;&s;ion with Elizabeth, whom they pre&s;&s;ed by letters and emba&s;&s;ies to ha&s;ten the conclu|&s;ion of the treaty. Charles of France had never heartily engaged in the intere&s;ts of Mary, and at pre&s;ent his whole attention was employed in lulling the Hugue|nots into a fal&s;e &s;ecurity by an in&s;idious peace. And the duke of Alva &s;aw him|&s;elf on the brink of a &s;evere war, maintained by the prince of Orange, who had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Le&s;ley.</NOTE> rai&s;ed an army in Germany to join the malecontents of the Netherlands. Mary queen of Scots being &s;eized with a dangerous di&s;temper, Elizabeth &s;ent two eminent phy&s;icians to attend her; and, upon her recovery, pre&s;ented her with a ring, as a token of her friend&s;hip renewed; but, in fact, &s;he had no intention
<PB N="47" REF="490">
to relieve that unfortunate prince&s;s. The commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by Lennox and his faction arriving in London, refu&s;ed to give up the prince on any condi|tions; and de&s;ired the treaty might be laid a&s;ide. Elizabeth was not only re&s;olved again&s;t relea&s;ing her rival, but al&s;o aver&s;e to the &s;on's being educated in England, where his pre&s;ence might &s;trengthen his mother's intere&s;t; and Len|nox and his confederates now acted by her particular direction.</P>

<P>When the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners arrived, with Morton at their head,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1571.</NOTE> the conferences were opened in pre&s;ence of the lord keeper, the lord chamberlain, the lord admiral Clinton, the earls of Leice&s;ter and Su&s;&s;ex, Cecil, lately created lord Burleigh, &s;ir James Crofts, Knolles, Mildmay, and Sir Thomas Smith, now appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate in the room of Cecil. The&s;e in the name of their &s;overeign demanded that the duke of Chateleraud, the earls of Huntley and Argyle, the lords Hume and Herries, &s;hould be detained three years as ho&s;tages in England, and the ca&s;tles of Dumbarton and Hume be delivered for the like cau&s;e, to be kept as a &s;ecurity for the performance of articles. The bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s and his colleagues rejected the&s;e demands, alledging, that a compliance with them would rob their mi&s;tre&s;s of her be&s;t friends and places of &s;ecurity. The lord keeper told them, in a contemptuous manner, that their whole king|dom, though delivered up, would not be a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity; and declared, that if his advice might be followed, the queen &s;hould not relea&s;e Mary on any condition what&s;oever. The bi&s;hop ob&s;erved, that if queen Elizabeth was of the &s;ame opinion, it would be needle&s;s to proceed in the treaty, and de&s;ired to know her re&s;olution in that particular. The Engli&s;h deputies promi&s;ed to con|&s;ult her maje&s;ty on the &s;ubject; and in the mean time, having conferred with Morton and his a&s;&s;ociates, declared at their next meeting, that the commi&s;&s;ioners from Lennox refu&s;ed to treat about the delivery of the prince, or the re&s;toration of his mother, alledging that their commi&s;&s;ion did not extend &s;o far; but that Morton would return to Scotland, in order to procure full powers from the parliament of that kingdom. The bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s could not help recapitula|ting<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> the particulars of Elizabeth's eva&s;ive conduct and in&s;incerity, &s;ince the beginning of this di&s;pute; and then declared he and his followers had no power to agree to any further delay.

The confe|rences were broke up: the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s was ordered to withdraw from Lon|don; but his mi&s;tre&s;s commanded him to remain in that city, as her amba&s;&s;a|dor and agent.</P>

<P>After the mi&s;carriage of this negotiation, Catherine de Medicis, queen mother of France, propo&s;ed a match between her &s;econd &s;on Henry, duke of Anjou, and queen Elizabeth, who expre&s;&s;ed no aver&s;ion to the alliance. She agreed to be&s;tow upon him a matrimonial crown, with a &s;hare in the admini|&s;tration of public affairs$ but &s;he would not con&s;ent to his hearing ma&s;s even in private; and this difference was the pretext for breaking off the treaty: but indeed there was no &s;incerity on either &s;ide. The queen mother of Fran$e wanted to divert Elizabeth from a rumoured match between her and the king of Navarre, and to create a fal&s;e confidence in the chiefs of the Huguenots, whom &s;he had devoted to de&s;truction; while, on the other hand, Elizabeth's aim was to amu&s;e the king of France with a negotiation, which would prevent him from &s;ending &s;uccours to Mary's friends in Scotland.

The plague, which had raged two years in London, being now abated, the queen made a public entry into that capital; and vi&s;iting the &s;tructure which Sir Thomas Gre&s;ham had rai&s;ed for the con|venience of merchants, it was denominated the Royal Exchange, by &s;ound of<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> trumpet.</P>

The fir&s;t law enacted was levelled at tho&s;e who &s;hould attempt any thing again&s;t the queen, or que&s;tion her right to the crown, or call her heretic, &s;chi&s;matic, infidel, or u&s;urper, either by word or writing, or maintain during her life, that any per&s;on was or ought to be her &s;ucce&s;&s;or, except the natural i&s;&s;ue of her body.

By a third &s;tatute, all natives and denizons of the realm departing the king|dom, and not returning within &s;ix months of the proclamation, were &s;ubjected to forfeiture of per&s;onal or real e&s;tate, to be re&s;tored however on their &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion; and it annulled all fraudulent deeds and conveyances, executed in order<NOTE PLACE="marg">D$$we.</NOTE> to prevent the queen's enjoying the benefit of their confi&s;cation.

duke de Chateleraud, being found in the ca&s;tle, was &s;hamefully put to death, for having rebelled again&s;t the young prince in behalf of his mother. The war being renewed between the two parties, Lennox was wor&s;ted in &s;everal engagements: the friends of Mary convoked a parliament at Edinburgh, in which the queen's re&s;ignation was declared of no force or effect; and all &s;ub|jects were enjoined to obey the queen as their lawful &s;overeign. Sir W. Drury, mar&s;hal of Berwick, was ordered by Elizabeth to march with a body of forces to the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, where he found both parties drawn up in order of battle: he interpo&s;ed his good offices to prevent mi&s;chief; and they con&s;ented to wheel about and retire from each other, when he &s;hould throw up his hat for a &s;ignal. Accordingly, the queen's party turned their faces to|wards Edinburgh; when Morton, perceiving that they marched in a carele&s;s and tumultuous manner, fell upon their rear, and pur&s;ued them to the gates of the city. This treachery the Scots a&s;cribed to the in&s;tigation of Drury. It<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crawford.</NOTE> was denominated Drury's peace, or the black Saturday; and that officer became extremely odious to the Scotti&s;h nation.

<P>At this perlod, a new con&s;piracy was hatched in England, by Robert Ridolphi, a Florentine merchant and banker, who long re&s;ided in London, and acted privately as agent for the pope. He had, at the de&s;ire of the Scotti&s;h queen, conferred with the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s about the offers which had been made to her by the pope and the king of Spain; and the &s;ub&s;tance of this conver&s;a|tion was &s;ent in cyphers to the duke of Norfolk. They were conveyed to him by Banni&s;ter and Barker, two of his dome&s;tics, in wh$$$ he chiefly con&s;ided, and decyphered by his &s;ecretary Hickford. Ridolphi, being introduced to the duke, pre&s;&s;ed him to head an enterprize which he had projected for the re|lea&s;e of Mary. This was no other than an in&s;urrection at home, rai&s;ed by the friends of that prince&s;s, and &s;upported by an inva&s;ion of Spani&s;h troops from the Low-Countries. The duke of Norfolk, who was a good prote&s;tant and a loyal &s;ubject, could not reli&s;h a &s;cheme patronized by the pope and the catholic intere&s;t; but he civilly told Ridolphi, that he would do every thing in his power for the relief of the Scotti&s;h queen; and that his project was fea|&s;ible. He ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to &s;ign letters of credence, which Ridolphi had prepared, to the pope, the king of Spain, and the duke of Alva. He would not even confer with the noblemen whom the Italian repre&s;ented as friends to the undertaking; and he ordered Hickford to burn the papers which he had received; though, in this particular, the &s;ecretary did not obey his ma&s;ter's command. Ridolphi repairing to Bru&s;&s;els, imparted the project to the duke of Alva, who promi&s;ed to recommend it in the &s;tronge&s;t manner to his ma&s;ter the king of Spain. Then the Italian explained the re&s;ult of his conver&s;ation

with the duke of Alva, to one Charles Ba$l$ff, in the &s;ervice of queen Mary, who was at that time in Bru&s;&s;$is, and ready to depart for England. This man he likewi&s;e intr$&s;ted with letters to the queen of Scotland, the duke of Norfolk, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, the lord Lumley, and the bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s. Being &s;earched at Dover, he was committed to the Mar&s;hal&s;ea, after all his packets had been &s;eized. When put to the torture, he confe&s;&s;ed the whole tran&s;action.

<P>While he continued in cu&s;tody, the French amba&s;&s;ador having oc|ca&s;ion to &s;end a &s;upply of money to Verac the agent in Scotland, it was in|tru&s;ted to the care of one Browne, a dome&s;tic to the duke of Norfolk, in order to be forwarded to the frontiers. This man being a &s;py in the family, delivered the money to the council, declaring he had received it from Hickford$ and that it came from the French amba&s;&s;ador. Hickford being committed to the $ower, and a&s;ked if he knew of any letters which had pa&s;&s;ed between the queen of Scots and his ma&s;ter, owned that he had &s;ecreted &s;ome papers under the matts of the duke's bed, where they were immediately found; and the whole corre&s;pondence was di&s;covered.

When he heard the confe&s;&s;ions of his &s;ervants, and knew that the letters were di&s;covered, he expre&s;&s;ed great a&s;toni&s;hment; de&s;ired the coun|cil to intercede with the queen in his behalf, and a&s;&s;ured them he would ex|plain all his tran&s;actions, affirming, that whatever might have been propo&s;ed to him, he had never agreed to any &s;cheme which might tend to the prejudice of his &s;overeign, or di&s;turb the quiet of her kingdom. He owned, that the greate&s;t part of the de&s;igns formed for &s;etting the queen of Scots at liberty had been imparted to him, but that he had always declared again&s;t their being put in execution: and that he was no &s;tranger to Ridolphi's project, in which he had never engaged.

Another tract of the &s;ame import was publi&s;hed and di&s;per&s;ed over the nation, in order to dimini&s;h the duke's popularity, and pave the way for his de&s;truction.</P>

where he was deprived of light and fre&s;h air, and debarred the u&s;e of pen, ink, and paper. From thence he was, in a few days, brought to the hou&s;e of the gover|nor of the Tower, where Burleigh, and the other coun&s;ellors, renewed his exa|mination. They gave him to under&s;tand, that the queen looked upon him as the author of all the con&s;piracies which had been hatched again&s;t her government: neverthele&s;s, he &s;hould &s;u&s;tain no hurt, if he would freely declare the part which he had acted in tho&s;e de&s;igns. They did not de&s;ire him to own any thing which was not already confe&s;&s;ed. They a&s;&s;ured him his evidence &s;hould not be u&s;ed to the prejudice of any per&s;on whatever: whereas, &s;hould he refu&s;e to an&s;wer, &s;he would, without he&s;itation, cau&s;e him to be executed, as one of her own &s;ubjects who had &s;ought the &s;ubver&s;ion of her e&s;tate. The bi&s;hop being allowed to peru&s;e the depo&s;itions of the other pri&s;oners, and finding all the papers were di&s;covered, confirmed their confe&s;&s;ions, except in the article of breaking up the parliament and &s;eizing the queen, which he denied, in oppo&s;ition to Barker, with whom he was confronted. Elizabeth &s;u&s;pecting that there was &s;omething more in re|&s;erve, which he had not confe&s;&s;ed, he was again examined, and required to tell the names of the noblemen who had treated with him about bringing over foreign troops into England; but he &s;olemnly declared, that no nobleman of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> England had ever &s;poke to him of &s;uch a de&s;ign.</P>

<P>On the &s;ixteenth day of January, the duke of Norfolk was brought<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1572.</NOTE> by water from the Tower to We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, in order to be tried by his peers; George Talbot earl of Shrew&s;bury being appointed high &s;teward for the occa&s;ion. He was arraigned for having entered into a trea&s;onable corre&s;pon|dence again&s;t the queen's dignity and life: for having treated of a marriage with the queen of Scotland, contrary to his &s;olemn engagement: for having &s;upplied the earls of Northumberland, We&s;tmoreland, and other traitors, with money: for having craved auxiliary forces of the pope, the king of Spain, and the duke of Alva, to &s;et the queen of Scots at liberty, and re&s;tore the popi&s;h religion in England: and, la&s;tly, for having relieved the lord Herries, and others of the queen's enemies, in Scotland. He was denied the privilege<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fenclon.</NOTE> of council; and though no part of the charge which amounted to trea&s;on could be proved again&s;t him, he was found guilty, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all wi&s;e and unprejudiced per&s;ons, and the un&s;peakable regret of the nation in general. About this time the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador was ordered to quit the kingdom, on account of his connexion with Ridolphi, and the part he had acted in other con&s;piracies. He had exerted all his endeavours to prevent the match between Elizabeth and the duke of Anjou. He offered, in the name of Philip, to acquit her of the money &s;he had detained; and to repair the damage &s;u&s;tained by the Engli&s;h merchants in the Spani&s;h territories. He propo&s;ed a marriage between the queen and the emperor's &s;on Rodolphus: he attempted to bribe the ladies of the court, and the lords of the council; and all his ef|forts mi&s;carrying, he charged Cecil as the cau&s;e of all the mi&s;under&s;tanding between the courts of London and Madrid. Borghe&s;e, his butler, was accu&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> of having hired Kenelm Barney, and Edmund Mather, to murder the lord Burleigh, and they being convicted of the undertaking, were executed accord|ing to law; but Borghe&s;e's life was &s;pared in con&s;ideration of his being &s;ervant to an amba&s;&s;ador.</P>

<P>The di&s;graceful di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador was &s;o highly re&s;ented by Philip, that he ordered all the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects in Spain to be impri&s;oned, and their effects confi&s;cated, and prohibited all commerce between<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recue$$ des Tr$$$es par $word$.</NOTE> the two nations. His re&s;entment was very little regarded by Elizabeth, who, in the month of April, concluded a defen&s;ive league at Blois, with Charles IX. of France, by which both parties engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other again&s;t all inva&s;ion. They agreed that no innovation &s;hould be made in the kingdom of Scotland; but that they would jointly defend it from all foreigners; and it was &s;tipulated, that in ca&s;e any Engli&s;h &s;hips &s;hould be taken or &s;eized in the Low-Countries, or in Spain, the French king &s;hould &s;ollicit re&s;titution at the court of Madrid; or that interce&s;&s;ion failing, make repri&s;als upon the Spani&s;h and Flemi&s;h &s;ubjects in his dominions, Elizabeth engaging to act in the &s;ame manner in his behalf. The earl of Lincoln, lord admiral, was &s;ent with a magnificent train to Paris, to &s;ee this treaty ratified by Charles; and the ma|rechal de Montmorency arriving in England to procure Elizabeth's ratification, was inve&s;ted with the order of the garter. Immediately after this event, the po&s;t of lord trea&s;urer, vacant by the death of the old marquis of Winche&s;ter, was conferred upon lord Burleigh; the privy &s;eal was given to lord Effingham;<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> the earl of Su&s;&s;ex was appointed lord chamberlain of the hou&s;hold, and &s;ecre|tary Smith created chancellor of the order of the garter.</P>

<P>The &s;atisfaction produced by this alliance was &s;oon interrupted by an event which evinced the French king and his mother two mon&s;ters of perfidy and di&s;&s;imulation. They had invited the admiral de Chatillon, and the count de Rochefocault, the chiefs of the Huguenots, to Paris, on pretence of their a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the marriage of the prince&s;s Margaret with the king of Navarre, and there they were cruelly butchered on St. Bartholomew-tide, together with about two thou&s;and other per&s;ons who profe&s;&s;ed the reformed religion. The &s;ame ma&s;&s;acre was perpetrated upon the Huguenots of Rouen, Meaux, Troyes, Orleans, Anger, Bourges, Lyon, Tholou&s;e, and other places, where above thirty thou&s;and were &s;acrificed. This butchery, which was highly approved at Rome, overwhelmed all the prote&s;tants in Europe with &s;orrow and con|&s;ternation. Elizabeth, in particular, looked upon it as the fir&s;t overt-act of the league of Bayonne, which was formed for the extinction of the prote&s;tant religion. Charles perceiving that the ma&s;&s;acre had driven the remaining Hu|guenots to de&s;pair, in&s;omuch that they began to take up arms in &s;everal pro|vinces, while the city of Rochelle refu&s;ed to admit his forces, re&s;olved to ca|jole Elizabeth, in order to prevent her a&s;&s;i&s;ting tho&s;e malecontents. When her amba&s;&s;ador Wal&s;ingham told him, in her name, that no confidence could be repo&s;ed in a prince who could be guilty of &s;uch an infamous action, he en|deavoured to excu&s;e him&s;elf, by alledging that the admiral had formed a con|&s;piracy to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him and his whole family; and he prote&s;ted that he had nothing &s;o much at heart, as to live in friend&s;hip with Elizabeth. This prince&s;s found it convenient to di&s;&s;emble in her turn. She received intimation from Wal&s;ingham, that there was an intimate union between the kings of France and Spain, notwith&s;tanding the profe&s;&s;ions of Charles, who pretended to dread the de&s;igns of Philip: that the duke of Gui&s;e had frequent conferences with the Scots in Paris; and that the queen-mother conferred in private with the

bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, who re&s;ided at the court of France is Mary's amba&s;&s;ador. From this information, Elizabeth and her council concluded, that the friend|&s;hip of France was not to be depended upon; but that it would be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;&s;emble, until they &s;hould procure farther intelligence touching the de&s;igns of the catholic princes. The queen therefore admitted of the excu&s;es made by Charles; a&s;&s;ured him of the continuance of her friend&s;hip, con&s;ented $word$ the renewal of the treaty for a match between her and the duke of Alen$on; and the queen of France being delivered of a daughter, &s;tood god-mother to the infant, which was chri&s;tened by the name of Mary-Elizabeth, in pre&s;ence of the earl of Worce&s;ter, who acted as proxy for the queen of England. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fenelo$.</NOTE></P>

Her agent, Sir W. Drury, and the French mini&s;ter Du Croc, on pretence of me|diating a pacification, found means to keep up a di&s;&s;en&s;ion between the two parties. The earl of Mar, and the laird of Grange, governor of Edinburgh|ca&s;tle, were &s;o &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to an accommodation, that Morton, who gaped after forfeitures, and found his account in the troubles of the kingdom, knowing no other method for preventing a reconciliation and coalition, is &s;aid to have poi&s;oned the regent at a banquet.

<P>The parliament meeting in May, the commons addre&s;&s;ed her ma|je&s;ty, that the duke of Norfolk might be put to death without further delay, alledging this &s;tep was nece&s;&s;ary for her own pre&s;ervation, and the peace of the kingdom. This addre&s;s furni&s;hed her with a pretence for doing that which &s;he had hitherto affected to po&s;tpone, from con&s;iderations of pity: &s;he granted a warrant for his execution; and he was beheaded on Tower-hill, where he &s;uf|fered with great fortitude, prote&s;ting the innocence of his intention towards the queen, and profe&s;&s;ing the prote&s;tant religion. He was the worthie&s;t and be&s;t beloved nobleman of all England. The tears ran down the cheeks of the earl of Shrew&s;bury when he pronounced his &s;entence; and the multitude wept bitterly at his death. The queen dreaded his popularity &s;o much, that &s;he did not think her&s;elf &s;afe while he exi&s;ted, con&s;cious as &s;he was of his attach|ment to the intere&s;t and per&s;on of Mary.

Mary had been more chearful than ordinary on the eve of the ma&s;&s;acre of Paris; a circum&s;tance from which her keepers concluded that &s;he knew of that dete&s;table enterprize before it was executed: they &s;ignified their &s;u&s;picion to the mini&s;try, and &s;he was more clo&s;ely impri&s;oned.</P>

<P>Elizabeth, at this juncture, had very little to fear, either from her dome&s;tic or foreign enemies. All the malecontents of England were intimi|dated into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, by the fate of the duke of Norfolk; and the duke of Alva was &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed in the Low-Countries, that he could not &s;pare the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the friends of Mary queen of Scotland. The cities of the Nether|lands, that refu&s;ed to pay the exhorbitant taxes which he impo&s;ed, were deprived of their privileges, and garri&s;oned with Spani&s;h &s;oldiers, who lived at di&s;cre|tion among the inhabitants; &s;o that all the provinces were ripe for revolt. The prince of Orange, who was at the head of the oppo&s;ition, &s;ollicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Elizabeth, offering to cede Holland and Zealand to her, if &s;he would join the in&s;urgents in expelling the Spaniards: but &s;he declined engag|ing in an expen&s;ive war; though &s;he granted refuge to the Gueux Marins, a con&s;iderable party of noblemen, and others, who had fled from the Low-Countries, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by exerci&s;ing piracy on the &s;hips belonging to the &s;ubjects of Philip. They &s;old their prizes in England, and their ve&s;&s;els lay at anchor in the Downs, or &s;ome harbour in that neighbourhood, until the duke of Alva agreeing with Elizabeth to expel all the Engli&s;h refugees from Flanders, &s;he ordered the Gueux to quit her ports, and forbade her &s;ubjects to furni&s;h them with provi&s;ions. In this emergency they united under the count of La Marche, to whom the prince of Orange granted a commi&s;&s;ion; and &s;ailing for Holland, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the Brille, which afforded them the convenience of a good harbour. The count de Bo&s;&s;u, governor of Hol|land, attempted to retake it, but mi&s;carried. Flu&s;hing and Campvere revolted from the Spaniards; Delft, Rotterdam, and Dort, &s;oon followed their example; and Enckhuy&s;en, with all the towns of North Holland, declared for the prince of Orange, who reduced &s;everal towns in Frie&s;land, as well as upon the Meu&s;e; while Mons was &s;urprized by count Lewis of Na&s;&s;au.

Commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed for &s;ettling the accompts of the &s;eizures made on both &s;ides: the balance was paid to the king of Spain, and the commerce between England and his territories renewed, by a treaty concluded at Bri&s;tol. The queen took care that the Engli&s;h merchants &s;hould be indemnified for the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained; &s;he likewi&s;e di&s;charged the debts which had been contracted by her father, brother, and &s;i&s;ter; and the bonds granted by the city of London, for the payment of tho&s;e incumbrances, were now delivered up, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of the inhabitants. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fenelon.</NOTE></P>

<P>Rochelle, the great bulwark of the prote&s;tants, being be&s;ieged by the duke of Anjou, and reduced almo&s;t to extremity, for want of powder and provi&s;ions, large contributions were rai&s;ed in London, to equip an armament for its relief. When remon&s;trances were made to the queen on this &s;ubject by the French amba&s;&s;ador, &s;he &s;aid &s;he did not believe &s;o much money as he men|tioned could be found in the city of London; but that it was very natural for the merchants to &s;ell their provi&s;ions and commodities where they could find the be&s;t market. The count of Montgomery was at the head of this arma|ment, con&s;i&s;ting of five and fifty &s;hips, that &s;ailed in April for Rochelle; but finding it impracticable to &s;uccour the place, they returned next month to England, in order to rai&s;e a greater number of forces. The bi&s;hop of Lon|don, and the earl of E&s;&s;ex, in the name of the clergy and nobility, demanded her maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion to levy ten thou&s;and men, by private collection, for the &s;upport of the inhabitants of Rochelle; but this &s;he refu&s;ed, as an act contrary to her la&s;t treaty with France. M. de Fenelon demanded that Mont|gomery and his accomplices &s;hould be delivered into the hands of his ma&s;ter, that they might be puni&s;hed for their rebellion: but &s;he told him &s;he would repeat the an&s;wer which Henry II. of France made on the like occa&s;ion to her &s;i&s;ter Mary: She would not be the French king's executioner. The duke of Anjou lo&s;t four and twenty thou&s;and men before Rochelle, which was de|fended with &s;uch de&s;perate ob&s;tinacy, that he had made but little progre&s;s in the &s;iege, when he received the tidings of his being elected king of Poland. This event affording him a &s;alvo for his reputation, he concluded a treaty with the inhabitants, in which their allies of Ni&s;mes and Montauban were comprehended. Queen Elizabeth took offence at her lover, the duke of Alen&ccedil;on, for acting as volunteer at this &s;iege, again&s;t the French prote&s;tants; but he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, on account of his honour's being engaged in &s;uch a manner, that he could not quit the &s;ervice without a blemi&s;h on his reputation. He pro&s;ecuted his &s;uit in a great number of letters: his picture was &s;ent over to England; and the queen granted a &s;afe-conduct, by virtue of which he might &s;afely vi&s;it the court of London: another was expedited for the duke of Anjou, who purpo&s;ed to pa&s;s through the Briti&s;h &s;eas to Poland: but no u&s;e was made of either.

<P>By this time the friends of Mary in Scotland were compelled to &s;ubmit to Morton the regent. They con&s;i&s;ted of two parties, one of which had adhered to her from the beginning, and the other favoured her cau&s;e, that the troubles of their country might be the &s;ooner pacified. The fir&s;t was headed by the duke de Chateleraud and the earl of Huntley. The chiefs of the other were the earl of Home, &s;ecretary Lidington, and the laird of Grange, governor of the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, in which they re&s;ided. Morton employed Sir James Melvil to effect a &s;eparate accommodation with the&s;e la&s;t, and pro|po&s;ed &s;uch terms as they would have willingly embraced, provided the re&s;t of the queen's friends might have been comprehended in the treaty. But Morton did not de&s;ire to be at peace with the whole party: his view was to enrich him|&s;elf with forfeitures. He therefore propo&s;ed a &s;eparate peace or none; and Grange rejected his propo&s;al from motives of honour. Then the regent had recour&s;e to the duke and Huntley, who were not &s;o &s;crupulous. They ac|cepted of a &s;eparate peace; and now he would not indulge Grange and his a&s;|&s;ociates with the terms he had offered before. Sir W. Drury marched from Berwick with a reinforcement, and a train of artillery, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in re|ducing the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, which was very ill provided with ammu|nition; and the number of the &s;oldiers in garri&s;on did not exceed one hundred and &s;ixty. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;advantages, the governor, who was a man of great courage, conduct, and experience, made a vigorous de|fence for three and thirty days, during which the water in the draw-well failed. Then the be&s;ieged were fain to let down the &s;oldiers by ropes over the walls, to fetch water from a neighbouring fountain, which being poi&s;oned by the enemy, the garri&s;on that drank of it fell &s;ick and died; &s;o that it was now reduced to fifteen individuals. In this emergency, Grange &s;urrendered to Sir W. Drury, upon an honourable capitulation: but Elizabeth refu&s;ing to accept of him and his friends as her pri&s;oners, they were delivered to Morton, who cau&s;ed the governor, and his brother Sir James Kirkaldy, to be hanged on a gibbet, at the market-cro&s;s of Edinburgh: &s;ecretary Lidington is &s;aid to have died at Leith like an old Roman; and Home, paying ten thou&s;and pounds to Morton, was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ca&s;tles. The regent, not yet &s;atisfied with blood, demanded that Elizabeth would deliver into his hands the bi&s;hop of Ro$s, who had been relea&s;ed from the Tower, at the interce&s;&s;ion of the mar$chal de Montmorency, and committed in cu&s;tody to the bi&s;hop of Win|che&s;ter. But the French amba&s;&s;ador remon&s;trating again&s;t &s;uch an outrage<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fenelon. Cr$wford.

Scotland was united under her creature the earl of Morton; the friends of Mary in England were effectually quelled; and the nation enjoyed the mo&s;t profound tranquillity.

Neverthele&s;s, as he renewed ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Huguenots, &s;he furni&s;hed John Ca&s;imir, &s;on to the elector palatine, with a &s;um of money to levy a body of German auxiliaries for the &s;ervice of the duke of Alen&ccedil;on, who had made his e&s;cape from court and joined the malecontents. The queen of Eng|land had now accompli&s;hed all her aims, but that of having the prince of Scotland in her hands; and the earl of Morton would have willingly gratified her in that particular, had not young James been carefully protected by his governor, Alexander Er&s;kine, in the ca&s;tle of Stirling, who refu&s;ed to give up his charge without an order of parliament. Elizabeth &s;ent large &s;ums to Scotland with Sir H. Killegrew, to facilitate this event; but the Scots would not &s;uffer their prince to be carried out of the kingdom. Sir John Carmichael, warden of the Scotti&s;h Marches, meeting, at a place called the Red&s;quair, with Sir John Fo&s;ter, who acted in the &s;ame capacity on the Engli&s;h borders, and was be&s;ides governor of Berwick, the Scotti&s;h warden delivered up the Engli&s;h fu|gitives who were in his hands, according to cu&s;tom and convention; and, when he demanded the Scotti&s;h refugees in return, Sir John Fo&s;ter treated him with intolerable in&s;olence.

Although &s;he refu&s;ed to comply with the&s;e reque&s;ts; yet, upon his &s;ending away the earl of We&s;t|moreland, and the Engli&s;h fugitives, from the Low-Countries, and di&s;&s;olving the &s;eminary at Douay, &s;he bani&s;hed all the Dutch who carried arms again&s;t the king of Spain, and prohibited her &s;ubjects from receiving any &s;uch per|&s;ons into any of the ports or harbours of England. The prince of Orange, and the e&s;tates of Holland and Zealand, finding them&s;elves unable to &s;upport the war much longer again&s;t the wealth and power of Philip, &s;ent deputies to implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Elizabeth, and offer to her the &s;overeignty of their country, as the lineal heir of Philippa, wife of Edward III. and daughter of William count of Hainault, Holland, Zealand, and Frie&s;land. The&s;e deputies were kindly received by Elizabeth, notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of Cham|pigny, whom the governor of the Netherlands &s;ent over to traver&s;e their ne|gotiation; but &s;he was very loth to engage in a war upon their account.

They plundered Mae&s;tricht and Antwerp, where they ma&s;&s;acred &s;eventeen thou&s;and per&s;ons, without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex. At length the e&s;tates of the Walon pro|vinces called in the prince of Orange to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

Accordingly, the Spaniards were expelled from many towns and ca&s;tles, when Don John of Au&s;tria arriving at Luxembourg, demanded the &s;ole command of their &s;tanding forces, and a certain number of ho&s;tages for his &s;afety. The e&s;tates, alarmed at the&s;e marks of di&s;tru&s;t, in&s;i&s;ted upon hav|ing a &s;hare in the government.

<P>The court of France was not le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed than the new go|vernor of the Low-Countries. The duke of Alen&ccedil;on hsd levied an army again&s;t the king, in favour of the Huguenots; and he was joined by the prince of Cond&eacute;, with the troops of prince Ca&s;imer: in a word, the prote&s;tants were &s;upported by the duke of Alen&ccedil;on, the king of Navarre, and the prince of Cond&eacute;, with an army of thirty thou&s;and men. Neverthele&s;s, the queen|mother found means to di&s;unite their councils, and then offered &s;uch terms of peace as they did not think proper to refu&s;e. The treaty was confirmed by the parliament of Paris; the duke of Alen&ccedil;on repairing to court, was detached from his party, and a&s;&s;umed the title of the duke of Anjou. The peace was no &s;ooner ratified, than the queen-mother, in conjunction with the pope's le|gate, the duke of Gui&s;e, and Don John of Au&s;tria, began to concert mea&s;ures for exterminating the prote&s;tant religion. The zealous catholics all over the kingdom engaged in a&s;&s;ociations again&s;t the enemies of the ancient religion. The&s;e were known by the appellation of the holy union, or the league. Of this, the king of Spain a&s;&s;umed the title of protector, and the duke of Gui&s;e declared him&s;elf the chief. It was promoted by the pope, pa|tronized by the queen-mother; and Henry him&s;elf, an indolent and effemi|nate prince, was hurried into the &s;cheme by the torrent of evil coun&s;el. He was even inflamed with extraordinary zeal upon this occa&s;ion. Being jealous of the duke of Gui&s;e, he declared him&s;elf chief of the league, which he &s;igned with his own hand.

thought proper to confirm by edict. Then it was re&s;olved, in an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates convened at Marche en famine, to publi&s;h a perpetual $$ict for compelling the Spani&s;h troops to quit the country. The&s;e troops were ac+cordingly &s;ent into Italy, and all the places remained in the hands of the &s;tates. At length Don John pulled off the ma&s;que, and &s;urprized the ca&s;tle of Na$ur. Then he attempted to gain over the German troops, who waited for their ar|rears, to deliver the places where they were in garri&s;on: but his &s;ucce&s;s was anticipated by the &s;tates, which engaged tho&s;e troops in their &s;ervice. Tho&s;e of Brabant conferred the &s;uperintendency of their country with the title of Ruart, upon the prince of Orange; and this &s;tep excited the jealou&s;y of the duke de Ar&s;c$ot, and &s;ome other Brabantine noblemen, who, in order to dimini&s;h the credit of the prince, propo&s;ed to the confederate provinces that they &s;hould elect one governor-general. The election fell upon Matthias, brother to the empe|ror Rodolphus II. and the prince of Orange was declared his lieutenant. Matthias pretending to e&s;cape from the imperial court, repaired to the Nether|lands, where he was inve&s;ted with his office; and then the e&s;tates declared war again&s;t Don John, who had already prepared for the rupture, by &s;ending for the troops from Italy. Elizabeth being informed of the &s;cheme which Don John had projected, with regard to her dominions, intere&s;ted her&s;elf &s;o warmly in the cau&s;e of the confederates, that &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon being made acquainted with every material deliberation of the &s;tates-general: but, at the very time when &s;he lent them money to maintain the war again&s;t Philip, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him by letters, that &s;he had no intention to infringe the antient alliance between England and the hou&s;e of Burgundy, alledging that her &s;ole view in &s;upplying the confederates with money, was to hinder them from throwing them&s;elves into<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> the arms of France. Philip was not at all &s;atisfied with this argument; but, he di&s;&s;embled his real &s;entiments, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be tempted to engage more effectually in their behalf. With re&s;pect to the affairs of France, the Hugue|no$s &s;eeing the king bent upon their de&s;truction, formed a counter-league for their own pre&s;ervation, declared the king of Navar$e their general, and the prince of Cond&eacute; his lieutenant. The edict of pacification being revoked, ho&s;tilities recommenced, though greatly to the di&s;advantage of the Huguenots: but, as the duke of Gui&s;e derived great credit from the management of the war, the king, who hated that nobleman, granted another peace to his pro|te&s;tant &s;ubjects. From this period Henry abandoned him&s;elf to e$$eminate plea&s;ures, and the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive expence, by which conduct he lo&s;t the e&s;teem<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> and affection of his people.</P>

<P>In the Netherlands, Don John of Au&s;tria being reinforced by the Spani&s;h troops from Italy, and another body of forces from that country, under the command of Alexander Farne&s;e, obtained a &s;ignal victory at Gem|blours over the confederates, who&s;e affairs began to decline in con&s;equence of religious di&s;putes. The towns of Am&s;terdam, Harlem, and Ut$echt, expelled their magi&s;trates, and put the government into the hands of the prote&s;tants. The catholics, alarmed at the&s;e events, which &s;eemed to portend the de&s;truction of the old religion, propo&s;ed to confer the government of the &s;tate upon the duke of Anjou, who was accordingly declared protector of the Belgic liberty. The prote&s;tants demanded that they &s;hould be $dmitted to the exerci&s;e of public employments, as well as the catholics. This demand was granted by the &s;tates, on condition that the catholics &s;hould enjoy the &s;ame privilege in Hol|land and Zealand. The&s;e two provinces eluded this article, and hence di&s;&s;en|tions aro&s;e among the confederates. This divi&s;ion was increa&s;ed by the inha|bitants of Ghent, who expelled the Roman prie&s;ts from their city; while the people of Artois and Hainault bani&s;hed the prote&s;tants in their turn. Don John, in hope of profiting by this animo&s;ity, attacked the army of the &s;tates in their camp at Rymenant in Brabant, and was repul&s;ed after a very ob&s;tinate engagement, in which Sir John Norreys, &s;econd &s;on of the lord Norreys of Rycot, and colonel Steuart, at the head of two regiments of Engli&s;h and Scotti&s;h volunteers, &s;ignalized them&s;elves by remarkable acts of valour. This attempt mi&s;carrying, Don John endeavoured to amu&s;e them with propo&s;als of peace, until his army &s;hould be reinforced. They agreed to the nego|tiation for the fame rea&s;on; for they expected to be joined by prince Casimer, and a con&s;iderable body of Germans; and the duke of Anjou had already ad|vanced to the frontiers of Hainault, with eight thou&s;and auxiliaries. By the&s;e junctions on both &s;ides, Don John found him&s;elf at the head of fifty thou&s;and men, including infantry and cavalry; and the army of the e&s;tates amounted to three&s;core thou&s;and; but this la&s;t was rendered u&s;ele&s;s by the di&s;putes be|tween the inhabitants of Ghent, and the provinces of Hainault and Artois. Some of their troops mutinied, and, joining the people of Artois, made in|$ur&s;ions into Flanders; and the inhabitants of Ghent brought over prince Ca|&s;imer to their intere&s;t$ by promi&s;ing to pay his &s;oldiers, he having &s;quandered away the money which Elizabeth remitted to him for that purpo&s;e.

<P>The queen of England &s;eemed now more than ever intent upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Simier, in revenge, did the earl ill offices with the queen; and was the fir&s;t who informed her of that nobleman's private marriage with the widow of E&s;&s;ex. She was &s;o incen&s;ed at this in|formation, that &s;he ordered the earl to be confined in the ca&s;tle of Greenwich, and would actually have committed him to the Tower, had not the earl of Su&s;&s;ex, though his enemy, generou&s;ly interpo&s;ed in his behalf, and repre&s;ented the inju&s;tice of puni&s;hing any &s;ubject for contracting a lawful marriage. Leice&s;ter, enraged to find his influence thus &s;uper&s;eded by an ob&s;cure foreigner, is &s;aid to have employed one Teuder, a life-guard-man, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Simier; and the queen being apprized of his re&s;entment, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, for|bidding all per&s;ons to injure or affront this agent, or any of his attendants. In a few days after this proclamation, Elizabeth being in her barge upon the Thames, with Simier, the earl of Lincoln, and the vice-chancellor Hatton, one of the rowers was wounded in the arm with a mu&s;ket-bullet, di&s;charged from a &s;hip-boat; and the young man who fired the piece, was apprehended and convicted of trea&s;on: but prote&s;ting, even at the gallows, that the &s;hot was merely accidental, the queen pardoned him, declaring that &s;he could not be|lieve any thing of her &s;ubjects, which a mother would not believe of her own children. The duke of Anjou, flattered by the intelligence he received from his agent, came over to England incognito, attended by two dome&s;tics only. He was introduced to Elizabeth, who expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction at his un|expected arrival; and, after they had conferred &s;everal times together in pri|vate, he returned to France, in full hope of &s;eeing his aim accompli&s;hed. This match was very di&s;agreeable to great part of the nation, and to the puri|tans in particular.

<P>While Elizabeth was employed in the&s;e mea&s;ures for cementing her friend&s;hip with the French king, the duke of Gui&s;e re&s;olved to embroil her with the prince of Scotland. For this purpo&s;e, he made u&s;e of E&s;me Stuart, baron D'Aubigny, &s;on of John Stuart, &s;econd brother to Matthew earl of Lennox. This young nobleman, who was educated in France, re|pairing to Scotland, on pretence of paying his re&s;pects to king James, who was his near kin&s;man, in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the good graces of the Scotti&s;h monarch.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1580.</NOTE> The Roman catholics in Ireland, being excluded from offices under the government, in&s;tigated by popi&s;h prie&s;ts, and encouraged by foreign potentates, were now upon the eve of a general revolt. James Fitzmorris reparing to Rome, undertook to reduce the kingdom of Ireland to the obe|dience of the holy &s;ee, and was furni&s;hed by the pope with a &s;mall &s;um of money, a con&s;ecrated banner, and letters of recommendation to the king of Spain, who &s;upplied him with a party of &s;oldiers, and three &s;hips, in which they arrived at Kerry. They were accompanied by the two prie&s;ts, one of whom was dignified with the title of nuncio. They built a fort at Smerwick: but the ve&s;&s;els were de&s;troyed by Thomas Courtney, captain of an Engli&s;h &s;hip of war; and Fitzmorris was &s;lain by his own kin&s;men, the &s;ons of W.

Sir W. Drury, the lord deputy, being taken ill at Waterford, the command of his troops devolved to Nicholas Malby, pre&s;ident of Connaught, who routed John Fitzgerald; but his com|mi&s;&s;ion

expiring at the death of the deputy, Sir W. Pelham was appointed lord ju&s;tice of Ireland, and Thomas earl of Ormond governor of Mun&s;ter. The earl of De&s;mond declaring for the rebels, was proclaimed a traitor. His country was laid wa&s;te by Ormond, while Pelham marched into Mun&s;ter. The principal inhabitants were obliged to give ho&s;tages for their fidelity; and the Spaniards being taken in Carig-foyle, were hanged with Julio their com|mander, contrary to the law of nations, and the dictates of common humanity. James Fitzgerald being defeated and mortally wounded by Donel, brother to Cormac Maccarty, was delivered to Worham St. Leger, and Walter Raleigh, an officer lately &s;ent over, then tried and executed as a traitor; while his brother the earl of De&s;mond fled from one lurking-place to another, &s;uing in vain for pardon. The &s;pirits of the rebels, dejected by this bad &s;ucce&s;s, were rai&s;ed by a reinforcement of &s;even hundred Spani&s;h and Italian &s;oldiers, with arms for five thou&s;and men, who arrived at Smerwick, under the command of an offi|cer called San Jo&s;eph. There they were be&s;ieged by the earl of Ormond, the lord lieutenant, Raleigh, Mackworth, Denny, and other officers, while a &s;qua|dron of &s;hips commanded by Winter blocked them up by &s;ea. After a &s;iege of five days, San Jo&s;eph, though his garri&s;on reinforced by the natives, amounted to fifteen hundred men, &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. All the Spani&s;h &s;oldiers were ma&s;&s;acred, and the Iri&s;h hanged as rebels, by order of a council of war, to the eternal di&s;grace of the victors.

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year, Francis Drake returned to England from a voyage in which he had encircled the terre&s;trial globe.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ C$. 15$1.</NOTE> The plea&s;ure which the queen enjoyed on this occa&s;ion, was interrupted by the di&s;tre&s;s of the earl of Morton in Scotland, who had always been her abject dependant. He had formed a &s;cheme for delivering his ma&s;ter into the hands of Elizabeth; but this taking air was prevented. The queen of England perceiving that Morton's ruin was planned by the duke of Lennox, and his colleague Stuart by this time created earl of Arran, &s;ent Bowes into Scotland to open the eyes of the young king with re&s;pect to the&s;e favourites; and to accu&s;e Lennox of holding corre&s;pondence with the court of France, and with the duke of Gui&s;e in particular, to the prejudice of England and Scotland. This envoy being refu&s;ed audience, was immediately recalled; and Alexander Hume &s;ent to England by James to excu&s;e his conduct, was treated with the &s;ame indignity. The Scotti&s;h council being a&s;&s;embled in Holyrood-hou&s;e, James Stuart, a younger &s;on of lord Ochiltree, falling on his knees before the king, accu&s;ed the earl of Morton of con&s;piring the death of his maje&s;ty's father. In con&s;equence of this charge, Morton was apprehended and conveyed to the ca&s;tle of Dumbarton. Elizabeth no &s;ooner heard of his arre&s;t, than &s;he di&s;patched Randolph to intercede in his behalf. This mini&s;ter endeavoured to intimidate James, by repre&s;enting the danger
<PB N="67" REF="690">
of a quarrel with England. Being allowed to harrangue the &s;tates when they met, he told them, in the name of his mi&s;tre&s;s, that the duke of Lennox had endeavoured to de&s;troy the friendly corre&s;pondence between the two nations, to alienate the heart of the king from his faithful clergy, and even practi&s;ed with foreign princes to invade England. In &s;upport of this charge, he pro|duced &s;ome letters, the forgery of which was &s;o palpable, that nothing but his character of amba&s;&s;ador &s;aved him from being &s;ent pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle. Thus di&s;appointed, &s;he engaged the earls of Argyle, Montro&s;s, Glencairn, Angus, and Mar, in a &s;cheme of rebellion for the deliverance of Morton; an Engli&s;h army commanded by the earl of Huntingdon and lord Hun&s;don lay ready on the frontiers to join the revolters; but the con&s;piracy being di&s;|covered, Argyle, Montro&s;s, and Glencairn, returned to their duty, on pro|mi&s;e of being pardoned: the king's guards were doubled, his troops and gar|ri&s;ons augmented, and his &s;ubjects ordered by proclamation to hold them|&s;elves in readine&s;s to attend the royal &s;tandard. The Engli&s;h generals being apprized of the&s;e particulars, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their forces in Northumberland: An|gus was confined beyond the river Spey, and afterwards denounced a traitor: Mar was obliged to deliver up the ca&s;tle of Stirling; other friends and rela|tions of Morton were declared rebels. Randolph withdrew him&s;elf to Ber|wick: Sir John Seton was &s;ent to complain of his conduct, and to know if Elizabeth intended to engage in a war with Scotland; but he was detained at Berwick by an order from the court of England. Morton being brought from Dumbarton, was tried at Edinburgh, and being convicted as an accomplice in the murder of king Henry, was condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. The &s;entence, however, was changed into decapitation, which he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grawford.</NOTE> next day underwent with great compo&s;ure, after he had owned that he knew of the king's murder, though he was not an actor in that tragedy; that the queen had no concern in the affair; and that he had &s;igned an a&s;&s;ociation for defending Bothwell, who was the perpetrator. But he would not di&s;cover the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil.</NOTE> place in which his natural &s;on James, and one Macmorran had depo&s;ited his trea&s;ure; and all the money, amounting to a prodigious &s;um, was lo&s;t to the nation. He died unlamented, and &s;o little regarded, that after he was be|headed, his body lay all day upon the &s;caffold, covered with an old blue cloak, without attracting the compa&s;&s;ion, or even the notice of the people. Morton being thus removed, the two favourites reigned without controul, not only over the people, but al&s;o over the mind of their &s;overeign, who, with &s;ome capacity and inclination for &s;chool-learning, was a &s;illy, weak, irre&s;olute prince, of a very de&s;picable character. Lennox was not de&s;titute of good qualities$ but he was giddy and unexperienced, a profe&s;&s;ed Roman catholic, and a &s;up|po&s;ed adherent of the duke of Gui&s;e; &s;o that he &s;oon became odious to the nation. His colleague Arran was a young man void of principle and reli|gion, who, under the ma&s;que of friend&s;hip, encouraged Lennox to follow un|popular cour&s;es, that he might incur the hatred of the people, and &s;o contri|bute to his own de&s;truction.</P>

He ob&s;erved that the duke of Anjou had accepted the &s;overeignty of the Low-Countries; a dignity which might involve England in an expen&s;ive war with Spain: that therefore the queen judged it convenient to delay the match, until the duke &s;hould have extricated him&s;elf from this difficulty; and a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive &s;hould be concluded between France and England. To this remon&s;trance Henry an&s;wered, That he was ready to renew the defen&s;ive league, and would treat about a league offen&s;ive after the con&s;ummation of the marriage.</P>

His troops, amounting to &s;ixteen thou&s;and men, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of gentlemen and their va&s;&s;als, who engaged in the &s;ervice as volunteers, without thinking them&s;elves &s;ubject to military di&s;cipline,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> and dropped off occa&s;ionally, for want of pay or nece&s;&s;aries; &s;o that the duke was di&s;abled from joining the army of the e&s;tates, which waited for him be|twixt Li&s;le and Que&s;noy.

There he was received by Elizabeth with all the demon|&s;trations of the warme&s;t affection. On the anniver&s;ary of her coronation, &s;he, with her own hand, fixed a ring upon his finger, in token of pledging her

troth, according to the contract. She even proceeded &s;o far as to take up the pen, in order to &s;ub&s;cribe the articles; when all of a &s;udden &s;he threw it away, with violent marks of indignation; and, turning to the lords of the council, a&s;ked if they did not know that the marriage would put an end to her days; and that after her death they would cut one another's throats about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Leice&s;ter, Hatton, and Wal&s;ingham, were aver&s;e to this match. After &s;he had delivered the ring to the duke of Anjou, the ladies of the bed|chamber con&s;umed the night in weeping and wailing. Next morning, when &s;he was vi&s;ited by the duke, &s;he told him three &s;uch nights would bring her to the grave; that the aver&s;ion of her &s;ubjects to a French prince was in&s;ur|mountable; that he would derive little or no advantage from the alliance; but that in all probability it would produce great evils; and numberle&s;s incon|veniencies would ari&s;e from their differing in point of religion. She was &s;e|conded by vice-chamberlain Hatton, who di&s;&s;uaded him from proceeding further in the affair, as the queen, being now in the forty-ninth year of her age, was not likely to have children; and, as the king of France had not yet ratified the articles of the marriage. The duke retired to his lodgings, in the utmo&s;t mortification of di&s;appointment; he da&s;hed the ring upon the ground, ex|claimed again&s;t the ficklene&s;s of the female &s;ex, and cur&s;ed the incon&s;tancy of the Engli&s;h people.</P>

<P>Elizabeth was no le&s;s afflicted with various con&s;iderations. The duke's per&s;onal accompli&s;hments had actually made an impre&s;&s;ion upon her heart. She had conceived a pa&s;&s;ion which &s;he was re&s;trained from gratifying by &s;ome bodily infirmity, by the fear of di&s;obliging her &s;ubjects, and the ap|prehen&s;ion of parting with &s;ome &s;hare of her authority: &s;he dreaded the re|&s;entment of Anjou, who might e&s;pou&s;e a daughter of Spain, and multiply the dangers to which her kingdom was expo&s;ed. Such an alliance was even &s;aid to be upon the anvil; and therefore &s;he would not allow the duke to return to the Netherlands, though the e&s;tates pre&s;&s;ed him to go thither and oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the prince of Parma. He was flattered with new hopes of the marriage; entertained for three months with an uninterrupted &s;eries of diver|&s;ions; and at length di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a con&s;iderable pre&s;ent in money, after he had promi&s;ed to return in a month, and con&s;ummate the marriage. It was during the duke's re&s;idence at court that Stubbs, the author of the book written again&s;t the marriage, and Page the printer, were condemned to lo&s;e their right hands; and the &s;entence was executed on a &s;caffold in We&s;tmin&s;ter. When the right hand of Stubbs was cut off with a cleaver, he lifted off his hat with the other, exclaiming with a loud voice, "God &s;ave the queen." And the populace, in profound &s;ilence, te&s;tified their horror of this barba|rity, practi&s;ed upon a man of &s;ome note and unblemi&s;hed reputation. This was a &s;acrifice offered to the re&s;entment of the duke, who had been &s;canda|lou&s;ly reviled and in&s;ulted by the Engli&s;h nation. But the queen, in order to convince him of the little influence he had to expect from the mar|riage, cau&s;ed Campian, and the other prie&s;ts whom we have already mentioned, to be put to death for &s;upporting the papal authority in England. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE></P>

They managed the finances without &s;upplying him with money: they di&s;po&s;ed of all magi&s;tracies and of|fices: they would not admit the French troops into their towns, without the utmo&s;t precaution: and, in a word, he found him&s;elf a per&s;on of very little importance; while the prince of Orange, and a few deputies of the e&s;tates, engro&s;&s;ed the whole admini&s;tration. In order therefore to acquire more autho|rity, and intere&s;t France in his behalf, he formed a &s;cheme for making him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of the principal towns.

<P>Elizabeth, who fore&s;aw the bad con&s;equences of their di&s;&s;en&s;ion, endeavoured to &s;trengthen her&s;elf again&s;t the de&s;igns of Philip, by forming a league of the prote&s;tant princes of the empire; and, in the mean time, &s;he &s;ent the order of the garter to Frederic II. king of Denmark, a prince of great merit and reputation. She was the more &s;ollicitous about taking the&s;e pre|cautions, as her intere&s;t had declined in Scotland &s;ince the death of Morton. She con&s;idered the duke of Lennox as an agent for the duke of Gui&s;e, and con&s;equenly an enemy to her per&s;on: &s;he &s;aw, with regret, the young king in|tirely guided by his coun&s;els: but &s;he was &s;oon delivered from all apprehen|&s;ion of that favourite. By the in&s;tigation of Arran, he abu&s;ed his power to &s;uch a degree, that he lo&s;t the hearts of the nation, and rendered him&s;elf very odious, in particular to the friends of the late regent. He recalled the laird of Ferniher&s;t, and &s;everal other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, who had been bani&s;hed for their adherence to the king's mother. He e&s;tabli&s;hed a friendly corre&s;pon|dence between that prince&s;s and her &s;on, whom &s;he now con&s;ented to a&s;&s;ociate in the government, that all di&s;putes about the &s;upreme authority might be re|moved. So far he acted wi&s;ely for the benefit and quiet of the kingdom: but at the &s;ame time he di&s;obliged and per&s;ecuted the lords who had &s;upported the king in his minority. At length they formed a con&s;piracy for expelling him from the realm. The king returning meanly attended from Athole, was &s;eized by the earl of Mar, the lords Lind&s;ay and Boyd, the ma&s;ter of Oliphant, with &s;everal other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, and conveyed to Ruthven-ca&s;tle, the re&s;idence of the earl of Gowrie, who had been drawn into the plot on fal&s;e information. Lennox being at that time in Gla&s;gow, took refuge in the $word$ of Dumbarton: Arran was taken and confined in Ruthven. The king
<PB N="71" REF="730">
being conducted to Stirling-ca&s;tle, was obliged to &s;ign a declaration, import|ing, that what the lords had done at the Raid of Ruthven was for his &s;er|vice. The duke of Lennox was ordered to quit the realm; and James wrote a letter to the queen of England, a&s;&s;uring her that he was not under the lea&s;t re&s;traint. Elizabeth advi&s;ed him, for the peace of the kingdom, to recall the earl of Angus, and &s;end the duke of Lennox into France. This nobleman immediately complied with his ma&s;ter's de&s;ire; and, pa&s;&s;ing through Eng|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil. Jebb.

<P>The Engli&s;h perceiving that the authority of James began to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in Scotland, endeavoured to keep him in awe, by renewing the treaty for his mother's relea&s;e and re&s;toration. Beale had been &s;ent to queen Mary at Sheffield with certain propo&s;itions, to which &s;he partly agreed: but perceiving Elizabeth's drift, and being debarred all intercour&s;e with her &s;on, &s;he alarmed Elizabeth in her turn, by declaring her re&s;olution to re&s;ign all her rights and preten&s;ions in Scotland, and el&s;ewhere, to her &s;on, that he might act as he &s;hould judge proper for his own intere&s;t, without being prejudiced by her captivity. In that ca&s;e, &s;he &s;aid &s;he could be no longer charged with practices again&s;t the Engli&s;h government; and her enemies would have nothing upon which they could exerci&s;e their cruelty, but her poor, infirm, langui&s;hing body, worn out with hard&s;hips and affliction. It was not without rea&s;on this unhappy price&s;s complained of hard&s;hips. She had been confined thirteen years under different keepers, and often treated in the mo&s;t rigorous manner. She &s;aw her&s;elf deprived of her crown and liberty: her youth had pined away in dreary impri&s;onment: her reputation had been bla&s;ted by the venomous tooth of malice and defamation: all her &s;chemes were defeated; all her pro|&s;pects of relief entirely vani&s;hed: her life was in the power of a jealous rival, who could brook no competition: her health was in a great mea&s;ure impaired by confinement and vexation; yet &s;he was denied the conveniency of having fe|male &s;ervants to attend her in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the cour&s;e of this year, pope Gregory XIII. publi&s;hed a bull for reforming the calen|dar, cutting off ten days of the current year.

<P>This was the forlorn &s;ituation of Mary, when &s;he was informed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 15$3.</NOTE> of her &s;on's captivity. Her parental tenderne&s;s awoke: &s;he &s;ummoned all the mother, all the prince&s;s to her aid, and wrote a pathetic letter to Elizabeth, in which &s;he upbraided her with all the mi&s;eries &s;he had undergone; and con|jured her to interpo&s;e in behalf of a prince, a neighbour, an ally, a kin&s;man, in di&s;tre&s;s. Elizabeth was piqued at this warm expo&s;tulation, and de&s;ired her council to deliberate upon the conditions on which &s;he &s;hould be relea&s;ed. They accordingly drew up the following articles, which were pre&s;ented to Mary, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;he would a&s;&s;ociate her &s;on in the admini&s;tration. The queen of Scotland, and the king, &s;hall attempt nothing to the prejudice of England: She &s;hall di&s;approve of every thing that was done by her hu&s;band Francis II. and ratify the treaty of Edinburgh: She &s;hall di&s;cover and con|demn all the con&s;piracies which to her knowledge have been formed again&s;t queen Elizabeth: She &s;hall project no &s;cheme again&s;t the government of England,

Nothing was farther from the intention of Elizabeth than the re|lea&s;e of Mary, whom &s;he thus amu&s;ed with articles which were rejected by the Scotti&s;h lords of her intere&s;t, who had &s;ecured the per&s;on of their &s;overeign.</P>

<P>She had, when he was fir&s;t &s;eized, &s;ent her kin&s;man Henry Cary to offer him her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, though he was &s;urrounded by his captors, be found means to make this envoy acquainted with his real &s;ituation. Cary had been accompanied by the French amba&s;&s;ador de la Mothe Fenelon, whom his ma&s;ter had ordered to go thither and &s;upport the faction of the favourites, who&s;e di&s;a&s;ter, however, he could not prevent. The lords of Ruthven having ba|ni&s;hed one mini&s;ter, and impri&s;oned the other, advi&s;ed the king to a&s;&s;emble the e&s;tates, to whom he declared, in per&s;on, that he was very well &s;atisfied with tho&s;e noblemen by whom he had been conveyed to Ruthven. He wrote the &s;ame declaration to the general a&s;&s;embly of the kirk, which by authentic acts approved of the tran&s;action called the Raid of Ruthven. Then the greater part of the lords retired to their own hou&s;es; &s;o that the king found him&s;elf at liberty to follow his own inclination. He convoked an a&s;&s;embly of his nobles at St. Andrew's, where he owned that he had been apprehended for his own good; and that he would publi&s;h a general amne&s;ty in favour of tho&s;e who had conducted him to Ruthven; he even vi&s;ited the earl of Gowry, who falling upon his knees before him, and imploring pardon for his &s;hare of the con&s;piracy, into which he had been &s;educed by fal&s;e information of a plot hatched by Lennox again&s;t his life, the king rai&s;ed him up, and a&s;&s;ured him of his forgivenne&s;s and friend&s;hip. James afterwards nominated twelve coun|&s;ellors to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in managing the reins of government: but the earl of Ar|ran, who&s;e life Gowry had &s;aved from the enmity of the other con&s;pirators, being permitted to return to court, regained all his former a&s;cendancy over the &s;pirit of the king, who, by his advice, in&s;tead of an amne&s;ty, publi&s;hed a proclamation, offering pardon to all the con&s;pirators of Ruthven, who &s;hould come and ask pardon for the crime of which they were guilty. The lords, alarmed at this declaration, by which they were held as criminal, and &s;ub|jected to the mercy of a prince governed by the very mini&s;ter again&s;t whom they had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, retired, &s;ome to their own hou&s;es, and others into Eng|land, for protection.</P>

<P>Elizabeth reproached the king of Scotland, in a letter, for having broken his promi&s;e; and he replied, that the promi&s;e was extorted by rebels, while he was in captivity. Then &s;he &s;ent Wal&s;ingham, her &s;ecretary, into Scotland, on pretence of e&s;tabli&s;hing a more intimate union between the two powers; but his real de&s;ign was to ruin the earl of Arran, &s;trengthen the Engli&s;h faction, and examine the young king's capacity. Fenelon had carried thither his mother's re&s;ignation in his favour; and the king of France, with the neighbouring &s;overeigns, had, in con&s;equence of that re&s;ignation, acknow|ledged him as king of Scotland: &s;o that Elizabeth's jealou&s;y prompted her to &s;end her own &s;ecretary, notwith&s;tanding his infirm &s;tate of health, to make his

<P>At this period, the king of Sweden finding him&s;elf unable to oppo&s;e John Ba&s;ilowitz emperor of Ru&s;&s;ia, with whom he was at war, &s;ollici|ted the mediation of queen Elizabeth, who prevailed upon John to grant him peace on equal conditions. The Ru&s;&s;i&aacute;n had a very particular veneration for the queen of England, and de&s;ired &s;he would &s;end him a wife from her king|dom: but, as he arrogated to him&s;elf the power of repudiating his con&s;orts, according to his own plea&s;ure, no Engli&s;hwoman would accept of the dignity. In the cour&s;e of this year, Thomas Ratcliffe earl of Su&s;&s;ex died without i&s;&s;ue, and Mary queen of Scots lo&s;t a zealous friend by the death of Henry Wriothe&s;ly earl of Southampton.

Some part of the lands of De&s;mond was given by the queen to his kin&s;man the earl of Ormond, and the re&s;t granted to adventurers, who undertook to cultivate and improve the country.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Ch. 1584.</NOTE> James king of Scotland convoked his nobility at Edinburgh, where the earl of Arran, tampering with the individuals in private, gave them to under&s;tand, that the king was &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to pardon the lords of the Raid of Ruth|ven, after his own conduct &s;hould be vindicated in their being found guilty. The noblemen believing that the fugitives would receive no prejudice from an expedient contrived to &s;ave his maje&s;ty's honour, declared, in their a&s;&s;embly, that the king acted with uncommon clemency in granting them an opportunity to &s;ue for pardon. When the mini&s;ter had obtained this declaration of their guilt, he di&s;&s;uaded his ma&s;ter from publi&s;hing the amne&s;ty. He per&s;ecuted the earl of Gowry in &s;uch a manner, that he begged the king's permi&s;&s;ion to quit the kingdom; and had repaired to Dundee, in order to take &s;hipping, when he under&s;tood that the fugititive earls of Angus, Mar, and Glamis, had concerted another &s;cheme again&s;t the favourite. This information detained him at Dundee; and at length he engaged in the con&s;piracy. The other lords coming privately from Ireland, &s;urprized the town of Stirling; but Gowry being ap|prehended by an order from court, they imagined, as he was the king's rela|tion, he had &s;uffered him&s;elf to be taken in order to impeach them; and, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, they abandoned their enterprize by leaving the kingdom. The earl of Gowry was brought to Edinburgh, where he was tried, condemned, and beheaded: and Arran &s;till maintained his influence. Elizabeth under|&s;tanding that James kept up a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with his mother; that through Arran's means the French intere&s;t predominated at the court of Scotland; and dreading the thoughts of the king's marrying a foreign wife, of the Roman catholic religion, &s;ent Davi&s;on, afterwards &s;ecretary, to engage the favourite in her intere&s;t; and he &s;ucceeded to her wi&s;h, by means that are ea&s;ily conceived. Before this agent returned to England, the two courts agreed that the lord Hun&s;don for Elizabeth, and the earl of Arran for James, &s;hould meet upon the border to e&s;tabli&s;h proper regulations for maintaining a good under&s;tanding between the two kingdoms. There the&s;e two noblemen concluded a &s;ecret treaty, by which the earl of Arran engaged to hinder king James from marrying within the term of three years; Elizabeth pretending &s;he would furni&s;h him with a wife of the blood royal of England, who was not yet marriageable.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, lord Gray, a young Scotti&s;h nobleman of in&s;inuating addre&s;s, acquired &s;uch a &s;hare of the king's favour, that Arran became jealous of him; and, in order to remove him from court, per&s;uaded<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> James to &s;end him as his amba&s;&s;ador to England. He was &s;oon gained over to the intere&s;t of Elizabeth by pre&s;ents and care&s;&s;es; and affecting uncommon zeal for queen Mary, became ma&s;ter of all her &s;ecrets, which he communi|cated to the queen of England. The earl of Arran being informed of his practices, accu&s;ed him to the king; but he acquitted him&s;elf &s;o artfully, at his return to Scotland, that no regard was payed to the in&s;inuations of his rival. Elizabeth's mini&s;try was &s;o indefatigably vigilant, that &s;he received intelligence of every hint that was dropped in favour of the captive queen, who lived in $$o&s;e confinement, under the eye of the earl of Shrew&s;bury.

<P>Elizabeth, under&s;tanding &s;he was taxed with the&s;e cruelties in foreign countries, re&s;olved to transfer the blame upon her mini&s;try. She reprimanded her judges very &s;harply for having proceeded with &s;uch rigour again&s;t the ca|tholics; and they publi&s;hed a ju&s;tification of their conduct, affirming that no per&s;on had &s;uffered for religion, though &s;ome had been put to the torture for machinations again&s;t the &s;tate. They owned indeed that Campian the je&s;uit had been racked, though not with &s;uch violence but that he had been able to walk immediately after the torture: and that Bryan, one of his accomplices, refu&s;ing to declare the name of him who wrote the letters found upon him, they had ordered him to be debarred of nouri&s;hment, until he had demanded it in writing. Neverthele&s;s, the queen forbade them to put any per&s;on what&s;oever to the torture; and relea&s;ed &s;eventy popi&s;h prie&s;ts who were in pri&s;on. Throgmorton, before he was arre&s;ted, had conveyed a cabinet of private pa|pers to the hands of the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador Mendoza; but in his other coffers were two li&s;ts, one of the principal catholics in England, and the other of the &s;ea-ports at which a de&s;cent might be conveniently made upon the kingdom. The&s;e he in&s;i&s;ted upon being fal&s;e and counterfeit papers, put into his coffer in order to effect his ruin: but being threatened with the rack, at his &s;econd examination, he confe&s;&s;ed, that, when he was at Spaa, he had con&s;ulted with Jeney and Englefield, in what manner England might be the mo&s;t ea&s;ily in|vaded, and the government altered; and on that occa&s;ion the two li&s;ts were drawn up. He owned that Morgan, the Engli&s;h refugee in France, had a&s;&s;ured him, in a letter, the catholic princes were re&s;olved to invade England under the duke of Gui&s;e, in order to &s;et the queen of Seots at liberty: that, in hope of rai&s;ing money and promoting this expedition, Charles Paget had, under the name of Mape, arrived in Su&s;&s;ex, where it was propo&s;ed the foreign troops &s;hould land: that he (Throgmorton) had imparted the &s;cheme to the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, with whom he had concerted a method by which the Roman ca|tholics might levy men in the queen's name to join the foreign forces. This confe&s;&s;ion he retracted on his trial; yet neverthele&s;s he was found guilty, though two months elap&s;ed between his conviction and execution. In this in|terval, he endeavoured to obtain the queen's mercy, by &s;ub&s;cribing his former confe&s;&s;ion; but being di&s;appointed in his hope, he at the gallows denied every circum&s;tance he had before confe&s;&s;ed. Mendoza being brought before the council, and examined touching this tran&s;action, in&s;tead of an&s;wering the que&s;tions that were put to him by the members, upbraided the queen with all

her ill offices towards his ma&s;ter, and was ordered to quit the kingdom im|mediately. Elizabeth publi&s;hed a declaration to ju&s;tify her conduct with re|gard to this amba&s;&s;ador, and di&s;patched Wade with an excu&s;e to the king of Spain, who refu&s;ed him an audience. Lord Clifford, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, demanded that Morgan &s;hould be delivered into the hands of his mi&s;tre&s;s: Henry cau&s;ed him to be arre&s;ted for this purpo&s;e; but &s;uch a cla|mour en&s;ued among the zealots of his own kingdom, that he would not ven|ture<NOTE PLACE="marg">J$$$.

<P>The queen living in continual di&s;quiet, from the apprehen&s;ion of con&s;piracies formed in behalf of Mary, re&s;olved to amu&s;e that prince&s;s and her friends with a new negotiation. Wade, on his return from Spain, was &s;ent to tell her that Elizabeth would renew the treaty which had been inter|rupted, on condition that Mary would prevail upon her &s;on to pardon the lords of the Raid of Ruthven; and that &s;he would put a &s;top to the intrigues of the bi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow, her amba&s;&s;ador at Paris. Beale was &s;ent upon the &s;ame errand, with particular in&s;tructions to di&s;cover, if po&s;&s;ible, the nature of the corre&s;pondence which the duke of Gui&s;e maintained with Mary.

<P>The prince of Parma continued to gain ground upon the confede|rated provinces of the Low-Countries, which &s;u&s;tained an irreparable lo&s;s by the death of the prince of Orange, who was treacherou&s;ly &s;hot by one Baltha|zar Gerard, a Burgundian. His elde&s;t &s;on Philip being in the hands of the king of Spain, and bred in the Roman catholic religion, the &s;tates conferred the government of Holland and Zealand upon his &s;econd &s;on Maurice, though he was but eighteen years of age; and the prince of Parma taking the advan|tage of their con&s;ternation, inve&s;ted Antwerp.

Henry, who perceived his drift, employed all his influence in per&s;uading the king of Navarre to embrace the catholic doctrines, while the duke renewed the league, fir&s;t in Paris, and afterwards in the provinces. Hearing, however, that the king intended to arre&s;t him, he retired to his government of Champagne, where he engaged in a private league with the king of Spain.

William Parry, a Wel&s;hman, and member of the hou&s;e of commons, had manife&s;ted his zeal for the Roman catholic religion, by &s;ingly oppo&s;ing with great violence a bill that was brought into the hou&s;e again&s;t the je&s;uits. He had &s;poke with &s;uch indecent warmth on this occa&s;ion, that the hou&s;e confined him to his lodgings; from whence, however, he was in a few days relea&s;ed, and re&s;umed his place in parliament. Then it was that Henry Nevil, the pretended heir of the earl of We&s;tmoreland, lately dead in Flanders, accu&s;ed him of having con&s;pired the death of the queen: and he was committed to the Tower on this impeachment.

<P>In this &s;e&s;&s;ion the puritanical members were extremely trouble&s;ome in bringing in bills and petitions for a further reformation of religion: at length they demanded a conference, which was held at Lambeth, between arch|bi&s;hop Whitgift and their able&s;t mini&s;ters, in pre&s;ence of the earl of Leice&s;ter, and others of the privy-council, who were a&s;toni&s;hed at the weakne&s;s of the arguments u&s;ed by the puritans, and endeavoured to per&s;uade them to con|formity.

<P>Philip earl of Arundel, elde&s;t &s;on of the late duke of Norfolk, had embraced the catholic religion, to which he was zealou&s;ly attached: he had been twice examined before the council, and confined to his own hou&s;e, on &s;u&s;picion of practi&s;ing again&s;t the government. On the fir&s;t day of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, he withdrew in the time of divine wor&s;hip; and at length re&s;olved to retire to another country, where he could enjoy his religion in quiet. He wrote a letter to the queen, to be delivered after his departure, in which he told her, that, in order to avoid the misfortunes which had befallen his father and grandfather, he had taken the re&s;olution to quit the kingdom, though he &s;hould never quit his allegiance.

<P>At this period, a gathering cloud of mi&s;chief &s;eemed to hover over the head of Elizabeth. The power of her inveterate enemy the duke of Gui&s;e daily increa&s;ed. Philip of Spain, after having made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Portugal, was now on the brink of &s;ubduing the revolted provinces of the Netherlands; and means were u&s;ed to render James of Scotland &s;ub&s;ervient to a de&s;ign of invading England. The captive Mary was the center upon which all tho&s;e de&s;igns had ever turned, and therefore &s;he was devoted to de&s;truction. The mini&s;try of England, in order to avert the impending danger, re&s;olved to engage in alliances with the two northern crowns, and the prote&s;tant princes in Germany; to &s;upport the confederates in the Low-Countries; &s;uccour the Huguenots in France, &s;o as that they &s;hould not be oppre&s;&s;ed; and either make &s;ure of the per&s;on of James, or excite &s;uch troubles in his kingdom as would render him incapable of forming &s;chemes to the prejudice of England. Thomas Bodley was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador into Germany and Denmark, to propo&s;e a defen&s;ive alliance with Elizabeth, who being informed that James intended to demand the daughter of his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty in marriage, re&s;olved to u&s;e all her efforts to divert him from his purpo&s;e; for &s;he apprehended &s;uch a mar|riage would dimini&s;h her influence in the councils of Scotland. She therefore &s;ent Edward Wotton, a man of the mo&s;t in&s;inuating addre&s;s, to re&s;ide with the Scotti&s;h king, as the companion of his lei&s;ure hours and amu&s;ements, that he might gain the a&s;cendency over the &s;pirit of that weak prince; and he &s;uc|ceeded to admiration. The king of Denmark being apprized of the Scotti&s;h monarch's intention, &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to Scotland on pretence of demanding the re&s;titution of the Orkney i&s;lands, which had been long ago mortgaged to the Scotti&s;h crown; but Chri&s;tian's real motive for &s;ending the&s;e amba&s;&s;adors, was to give James an opportunity to propo&s;e the marriage.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="61" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; LXI.</HEAD>
<P>By this time Wotton had taken full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Scotti&s;h prince. He had captivated his fancy by giving a romantic account of his travels; en|tertaining him with ridiculous &s;tories of goblins and witches; flattering his vanity with exaggerated encomiums on his wi&s;dom and learning; and at|tending him a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly in all his parties of plea&s;ure. Having thus acquired an oracular authority, he per&s;uaded James that the king of Denmark was not of royal extraction, but de&s;cended of a race of merchants; and, for this rea&s;on, the amba&s;&s;adors were treated with the mo&s;t provoking contempt, until the king was undeceived by Sir James Melvil. Then they were honourably di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and in a little time followed by Patrick Young, chaplain to James, who &s;ent him to thank the king of Denmark for his emba&s;&s;y, and to &s;ee the two prince&s;&s;es, that he might be able to de&s;cribe their per&s;ons at his re|turn. In the interim, the earl of Arran was &s;uper&s;eded in his influence by the ma&s;ter of Gray, &s;econded by the intere&s;t of Wotton; and an accident which happened on the frontiers, had a very bad effect upon that mini&s;ter's fortune. The laird of Ferniher&s;t, who had married Arran's niece, holding a conference, according to cu&s;tom, with the warden of the Engli&s;h Marches, an Engli&s;hman was detected in the act of &s;tealing; and this circum&s;tance ex|cited a fray between the followers of the two wardens, in which Sir Francis Ru&s;&s;el, elde&s;t &s;on to the earl of Bedford, lo&s;t his life. Elizabeth, who hated Ferniher&s;t for his inviolable attachment to queen Mary, and wanted a pretext for the de&s;truction of Arran, affected to believe that the tumult was rai&s;ed at
<PB N="81" REF="830">
the in&s;tigation of the Scotti&s;h mini&s;ter; and demanded that he and his ally$ the laird of Ferniher&s;t, &s;hould be delivered into her hands. Though James refu&s;ed to comply with this reque&s;t, he ordered the earl of Arran to be con|fined in his own hou&s;e, and Ferniher&s;t was &s;ent pri&s;oner to Aberd$$n. This was all the &s;atisfaction Elizabeth could expect, con&s;idering that the affair could not ea&s;ily be determined in a court of ju&s;tice; becau&s;e, by the mutual con&s;ent of both nations, the evidence of a Scot did not convict an Engli&s;hman; nor was an Engli&s;hman's depo&s;ition ever taken again&s;t a native of Scot|land.</P>

<P>Wotton having removed Arran from the Scotti&s;h court, and cor|rupted great part of tho&s;e who were in daily attendance upon the king, re&s;olved to &s;eize the per&s;on of that prince, when he &s;hould ride forth a-hunting, and convey him directly to England. Being di&s;appointed in this &s;cheme, he formed a plan for forcing the ca&s;tle of Stirling; but James being informed of the de&s;ign, retired to Kincardin before the &s;cheme was ripe for execution. Wotton finding him&s;elf detected, fled into England; Gray withdrew him&s;elf to Athole, and the earl of Arran re&s;umed his mini&s;try. The fugitive lords being &s;upplied with money in England, entered Scotland, where they were joined by a &s;trong reinforcement under lord Maxwell, and advanced to Stir|ling, which they entered without oppo&s;ition.

Such was their moderation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Melvil.</NOTE> that they did not even take vengeance on their enemies. At a parliament held in Linlithgow, their pardons were confirmed.

<P>By this time the e&s;tates of the Netherlands were &s;o hard pre&s;&s;ed by the forces of Philip, that queen Elizabeth perceived the nece&s;&s;ity of fur|ni&s;hing them with effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She therefore engaged by treaty to &s;uccour them with five thou&s;and foot &s;oldiers, and one thou&s;and cavalry, un|der the command of an Engli&s;h general; and to pay the&s;e troops during the war, on condition of being reimbur&s;ed after peace &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. In the mean time it was &s;tipulated that &s;he &s;hould be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fle&s;|&s;ingen, Rammikens, and the Brille, as &s;ecurity for the repayment: that the Engli&s;h governors of the&s;e places &s;hould have no juri&s;diction over the inhabi|tants: that the towns &s;hould be re&s;tored to the &s;tates on the payment of the money: that the Engli&s;h general, and two other per&s;ons nominated by the queen of England, &s;hould have places in the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates; and that neither peace nor truce &s;hould be made without the mutual con&s;ent of Eliza|beth and the confederates: that in ca&s;e of her &s;ending a fleet to &s;ea, they &s;hould join it with a like number of &s;hips, to be commanded by the Engli&s;h admiral:

and, la&s;tly, that the harbours of both countries &s;hould be open to the &s;ubjects of each nation. In pur&s;uance of this treaty, the Brille was delivered to Sir Tho|mas Cecil; Sir Philip Sidney was appoin$ed governor of Flu&s;hing; the earl of Leice&s;ter was appointed general of the auxiliaries; and the queen publi&s;hed a manife&s;to to vindicate her conduct, alledging that the alliance between Eng|land and the Netherland related to the mutual welfare of both countries, rather than to any per&s;onal connection between the &s;overeigns: &s;he therefore deemed her&s;elf at liberty to &s;uccour the people of the Low-Countries, who were oppre&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards.

The prince of Cond&eacute; attempting to &s;uccour the ca&s;tle of Angers, which Gui&s;e had be&s;ieged, was &s;uddenly &s;urrounded by the enemy, and e&s;caping with great difficulty, repaired to the court of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> where he was ho&s;pitably received by Elizabeth. She knew her own intere&s;t was connected with the &s;afety of the Huguenots; and &s;upplied the prince with fifty thou&s;and crowns and ten &s;hips, by means of which he rai&s;ed the blockade of Rochelle. When the earl of Leice&s;ter arrived in Holland, the e&s;tates con&s;tituted him governor-general of all the United Provinces, with an almo&s;t dictatorial power, which was by no means agreeable to Elizabeth, who per|ceived their aim was to engage her farther than &s;he cho&s;e to embark in their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The confederates had conceived great hopes from the abilities of Leice&s;ter; but they found them&s;elves grievou&s;ly di&s;appointed in his admini|&s;tration, which was weak, cruel, and oppre&s;&s;ive. Notwith&s;tanding all his en|deavours, the prince of Parma continued his conque&s;ts, reducing Grave, Nuys, and Venloo, while the Engli&s;h forces atchieved nothing of importance.

<P>IMMEDIATELY after the ratification of the league with Scotland, the Engli&s;h mini&s;try di&s;covered a con&s;piracy again&s;t the life of Eliza|beth. Doctor Gifford, Gilbert Gifford, and Hodge&s;on, Romi&s;h prie&s;ts of the &s;eminary at Rheims, per&s;uaded one John Savage that there could not be a more meritorious action than that of killing an excommunicated prince; and this mad enthu&s;ia&s;t made a &s;olemn vow to murder the queen. John Ballard, another prie&s;t who had been privately in England, returned to Paris, accom|panied by one Maude, a &s;ecret &s;py of Wal&s;ingham, and ex$orted Mendoza, the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter at the court of France, to promote an inva&s;ion of Eng|land, while the be&s;t of the queen's troops were employed in the Netherlands. He con&s;ulted Charles Paget on the &s;ame &s;ubject, and coming back to Eng|land, imparted the &s;cheme to Anthony Babington, a young gentleman of De|thick in Derby&s;hire, who propo&s;ed that he, and five other $$out men, &s;hould a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Elizabeth. For this purpo&s;e he engaged Edward, brother to the lord Wind&s;or; Thomas Sali&s;bury of Denbigh&s;hire; Charles Tilney, one of the band of pen&s;ioners; Chidroc Titchburne, of Southampton; Edward Abingdon, who&s;e father had been cofferer of the hou&s;hold; Robert Gage, of Surry$ John Travers, and John Charnock of Lanca&s;hire; John Jones; Patrick Barnwell, an Iri&s;hman; and Henry Dun, a clerk in the fir&s;t fruits office. The&s;e were all bigotted Roman catholics; and admitted into their a&s;&s;ociation one Dolly, who communicated all their deliberations to Wal&s;ingham, together with Savage, who had already devoted the queen to de&s;truction. They bound th$m&s;elves by an oath of &s;ecrecy, and were even vain enough to employ a painter to dr$w them in one piece, with my&s;terious mottos, alluding to &s;ome de&s;perate undertaking. This performance was &s;hewn to Elizabeth, and the pictures made &s;uch a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon her memory, that &s;he recognized Barnwell in her garden, when turning to the captain of the guard, "Am not I well guarded, (&s;aid &s;he) without one armed man in my company?" Babing$on &s;eeing the nece&s;&s;ity of an inva&s;ion, to facilitate the &s;ucce&s;s of their mea&s;ures, introduced him&s;elf to Wal&s;ingham, whom he &s;ollicited for a pa&s;&s;port, by virtue of which he and Ballard might &s;et out on their travels. That mini&s;ter being well apprized of his intention, promi&s;ed to grant his reque&s;t, the more readily as he under|took
<PB N="86" REF="880">
to di&s;cover the &s;ecret de&s;igns of the Scotti&s;h fugitives in France$ but in a few $ays Ballard was apprehended. Babington, alarmed at this circum&s;tance, directed Charnoc and Savage to execute the murder with the fir&s;t opportunity: yet afterwards under&s;tanding that Ballard had been &s;eized as a popi&s;h prie&s;t, he changed his re&s;olution, and by letters pre&s;&s;ed Wal&s;ingham to procure the licence and relea&s;e of his friend, who would be of &s;ingular &s;ervice to him in executing the plan he had projected in the queen's behalf. The &s;ecretary &s;till amu&s;ed him with hopes of obtaining his de&s;ire; and, in the mean time, or|dered Scudamore, his own &s;ervant, to watch him in &s;uch a manner that he &s;hould not e&s;cape. Babington di&s;covering by accident that Scudamore was employed as a &s;py upon his actions, found means to e&s;cape into the fields, where he was joined by Dun and Barnwell. A proclamation was immediately i$&s;ued, in which they were de&s;cribed, and declared traitors. They were ap|prehended at Harrow, in the di&s;gui&s;e of pea&s;ants. Their accomplices likewi&s;e fell into the hands of the queen's officers. They confe&s;&s;ed the con&s;piracy, $leaded guilty at their trials, and were executed, to the number of fourteen, in St. Giles$s fields, their u$$al place of meeting.</P>

<P>Mary queen of Scots was charged with having carried on a corre&s;pon|dence with Babington, by means of Gilbert G$$$ord, who betrayed her letters to Wa$$ingham. In the&s;e letters &s;he approved of his &s;cheme for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Elizabeth, and &s;$tting her&s;elf at liberty. She advi&s;ed him to form an a&s;&s;ocia|tion, but to ab&s;tain from rai&s;ing an in&s;urrection, until a&s;&s;ured of foreign a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; to engage in the &s;cheme the earl of Arundel and his brothers; the earl of We&s;tmoreland, Paget, and others; and, in order to procure her own deliverance, &s;he directed him to overturn a cart in the gate of the ca&s;tle; to &s;et fire to the &s;tables, or intercept her as &s;$e rode out for exerci&s;e, between Chartley and Stafford. Immediately after the con&s;pirators were apprehended, Sir Thomas Gorges was &s;ent to make Mary acquainted with the tran&s;action. He acco&s;ted her purpo&s;ely when &s;he had taken hor&s;e to ride out from the ca&s;tle of Chartley, to which &s;he never returned. She was conducted from one gentle|man's hou&s;e to another, until &s;he reached the ca&s;tle of Fotheringay, in Nor|thampton&s;hire, where &s;he was clo&s;ely confined. Her papers were &s;eized, and &s;ent up &s;ealed to court; and her money &s;ecured, on pretence of preventing its being converted to the purpo&s;es of bribery. Nau, a frenchman, and Curle, a Scot, her two &s;ecretaries, were arre&s;ted and committed to pri&s;on. Upon examination, they are &s;aid to have owned a corre&s;pondence with Babington; that their mi&s;tre&s;s dictated the letters in French, which Curle tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, and then they were written in cypher. Atte&s;ted copies of the&s;e let|ters were &s;ent by Sir Edward Wotton to Paris, that the court of France might be convinced of Mary's being concerned in the con&s;piracy.</P>

<P>Thirty-&s;ix of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners arriving at Fotheringay on the eleventh of November, pre&s;ented her with a letter from Elizabeth, commanding her to &s;ubmit to a trial. She peru&s;ed the letter with great compo&s;ure; com|plained that every threatened danger, either from &s;ubjects or foreigners, was imputed to her by certain courtiers, who were her mortal enemies. She wondered the queen of England &s;hould command her as a &s;ubject, whereas &s;he was an ab&s;olute &s;overeign, and independent prince&s;s. She &s;aid &s;he would never &s;toop to any conde&s;cen&s;ion which might derogate from her royal maje&s;ty, or preju|dice the rank and dignity of her own &s;on; that the laws of England were un|known to her; that &s;he was de&s;titute of coun&s;el; nor could &s;he conceive who were to be her peers; that &s;he was even robbed of her own papers, and no per&s;on dur&s;t undertake to be her advocate. This declaration being committed to writing, and read to her, &s;he added, that in&s;tead of enjoying the protection of the laws of England, as Elizabeth alledged in her letter, &s;he had been confined in pri&s;on &s;ince her fir&s;t arrival in the kingdom; &s;o that &s;he neither derived the lea&s;t benefit from the Engli&s;h laws, nor could &s;he ever learn what &s;ort of laws they were. When the commi&s;&s;ioners pre&s;&s;ed her to &s;ubmit to the queen's plea&s;ure, otherwi&s;e they would proceed again&s;t her as contumacious, &s;he declared &s;he would rather &s;uffer a thou&s;and deaths than own her&s;elf a &s;ub|ject to any prince on earth; yet &s;he was ready to vindicate her&s;elf in a full and free parliament; that for aught &s;he knew, this meeting or a&s;&s;embly was de|vi&s;ed again&s;t her life, on purpo&s;e to take it away under colour of legal proceed|ings. She exhorted them to con&s;ult their own con&s;ciences, and remember that the theatre of the world was much more exten&s;ive than the kingdom of England. At length the vice-chamberlain Hutton vanqui&s;hed her objections, by repre|&s;enting that &s;he injured her reputation by avoiding a trial, in which her inno|cence
<PB N="88" REF="900">
might be proved to the &s;atisfaction of all mankind. This ob&s;ervation made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ion upon her, that &s;he agreed to appear, if they would ad|mit and allow her prote&s;t di&s;owning all &s;ubjection: even when they refu&s;ed to allow it, &s;he was contented with its being received and entered in writing. Then they proceeded to the trial, and $erjeant Gaudy charged her with know|ing, approving, and con&s;enting, to Babington's con&s;piracy. She denied that &s;he had ever known or corre&s;ponded with Ballard or Babington, or had the lea&s;t intimation of &s;uch a con&s;piracy. Babington's confe&s;&s;ion being read, in which mention was made of the earls of Arundel and Northumberland, &s;he &s;hed a flood of tears, exclaiming, <Q>&startq;Alas! what hath the noble hou&s;e of How|wards endured for my &s;ake?&endq;</Q> But, &s;oon recollecting her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aid Babing|ton's confe&s;&s;ion might be extorted by the rack, which was really the ca&s;e; that her adver&s;aries might procure the cyphers which &s;he u&s;ed, and forge whatever they plea&s;ed to invent to her prejudice; that it was improbable &s;he &s;hould ad|vi&s;e him to &s;ollicit the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Arundel, who was &s;hut up in pri&s;on, or that of Northumberland, a very young nobleman, with whom &s;he never had the lea&s;t connexion. She owned that &s;he had u&s;ed her be&s;t endeavours to recover her liberty, as nature her&s;elf dictates, and had &s;ollicited her friends for that purpo&s;e; but po&s;itively denied that ever &s;he harboured a thought again&s;t the life of Elizabeth. She ob&s;erved that many dangerous enterprizes might be attempted in her behalf, even without her knowledge; and expre&s;&s;ed her &s;u&s;|picion that her cyphers and characters had been counterfeited for the purpo&s;e of taking away her life, by Wal&s;ingham and his emi&s;&s;aries, who &s;he heard had already practi&s;ed again&s;t her per&s;onal &s;afety, and even contrived the death of her &s;on. Wal&s;ingham, thus accu&s;ed, ro&s;e up, and prote&s;ted that his heart was free from malice; that he had never done any thing unbecoming an hone&s;t man in his private capacity, nor ought unworthy of the place he occupied in the &s;tate; though his zeal for the queen's pre&s;ervation had prompted him to &s;ift and examine carefully all the con&s;piracies that were formed again&s;t her life and dignity. The queen of Scots declared her&s;elf &s;atisfied of his inno|cence, and de&s;ired he would give as little credit to the malicious accu&s;ations of her enemies, as &s;he now gave to the reports which &s;he had heard to his preju|dice. The written evidence of her two &s;ecretaries being produced, &s;he affirmed they had been either intimidated, tortured, or bribed, into a confe&s;&s;ion of what was ab&s;olutely fal&s;e: &s;he &s;aid &s;he was not to be convicted but by her own words or hand-writing: &s;he de&s;ired &s;he might be confronted with her &s;ecre|taries; and ob&s;erved, that were &s;he in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her notes, &s;he could an&s;wer more particularly. She demanded a copy of her prote&s;t, an advocate to plead her cau&s;e, and an impartial hearing in full parliament. Her reque&s;ts were re|jected; and the court, after having &s;at &s;everal days, adjourned to the twenty|fifth day of October, at the Star-chamber in We&s;tmin&s;ter, when all the com|mi&s;&s;ioners appeared, except Shrew&s;bury and Warwick.</P>

<P>Nau and Curle having &s;worn to the letters and copies which had been produced, &s;entence was pronounced again&s;t the queen of Scots, for having been privy to Babington's plot, and imagined, &s;ince the fir&s;t day of June, divers matters tending to the hurt, death, and de&s;truction of Elizabeth's per|&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> contrary to the form of the &s;tatute in the commi&s;&s;ion &s;pecified. On the &s;ame day, the commi&s;&s;ioners publi&s;hed a declaration, that the &s;entence did

not at all derogate from James king of Scots in his title and honour; but that he was in the &s;ame place, degree, and right, as if the &s;aid &s;entence had never been pronounced. To condemn a &s;overeign prince&s;s &s;o circum&s;tanced, again&s;t whom neither word, writing, or &s;ub&s;cription, could be produced, on the te&s;timony of her own &s;ervants, who were rewarded for their evidence; and without bringing tho&s;e witne&s;&s;es to confront her at her trial, was of a piece with that iniquity and inhuman oppre&s;&s;ion to which &s;he had been expo&s;ed &s;ince the day of her arrival in England. The parliament meeting on the twenty|ninth day of October, approved the &s;entence; and, in an addre&s;s to the queen, de&s;ired it might be put in execution. She expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t aver&s;ion to &s;uch violent mea&s;ures; and intreated the two hou&s;es to find &s;ome expedient to &s;ave her from the nece&s;&s;ity of taking a &s;tep &s;o repugnant to her inclination: but, at the &s;ame time, &s;he informed them of a con&s;piracy to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate her within a month; &s;o that they renewed their in&s;tances for the execution of Mary, and &s;he affected to amu&s;e them with my&s;terious an&s;wers. On the &s;ixth day of December, the &s;entence again&s;t Mary queen of Scots was publicly pro|claimed through the whole kingdom; and the lord Buckhur&s;t, with Beale, was &s;ent to notify it to that prince&s;s, and exhort her to prepare for death. When their me&s;&s;age was delivered, &s;he betrayed not the lea&s;t emotion; but, with a chearful countenance, thanked God that her trouble&s;ome pilgrimage would &s;oon be at an end. Then Sir Amias Paulet ordered her canopy of &s;tate to be taken down, and dive&s;ted her of all the other badges of royalty; an indignity of which &s;he complained in a letter to queen Elizabeth, as well as of the unfair u&s;e which had been made of her letters and papers: &s;he de&s;ired her body might be &s;ent to France; that &s;he might not be put to death in private; that her &s;ervants might enjoy the &s;mall legacies &s;he &s;hould bequeathe, and be &s;uffered to depart in peace to their own country.</P>

<P>Henry III. of France being apprized of their proceedings again&s;t Mary, &s;ent over Bellievre to intercede for her life with queen Elizabeth. That mini&s;ter arriving in London, was admitted to an audience, and made a very &s;trong remon&s;trance in favour of the captive queen. After having waited &s;e|veral days for an an&s;wer, he &s;ent M. de St. Cyr to court, renewing his reque&s;t for Mary's life, and de&s;iring time to make his ma&s;ter acquainted with the &s;ituation of that unfortunate prince&s;s. In an&s;wer to this reque&s;t, he received a verbal me&s;&s;age, importing that the queen would wait twelve days for Henry's remon&s;trance. In the mean time, Bellievre being admitted to her pre&s;ence at Greenwich, repeated his former arguments, to di&s;&s;uade her from imbruing her hands in the blood of her kin&s;woman; an unhappy prince&s;s, doubly intitled to the rights of ho&s;pitality, as a gue&s;t and &s;uppliant. He demon&s;trated that the execution of Mary would be an outrage again&s;t the law of nature and nations, the dictates of humanity, and the &s;ugge&s;tions of Elizabeth's own intere&s;t; and concluded his harrangue by telling her, that &s;hould &s;he proceed to extremities of rigour, his ma&s;ter would re&s;ent her conduct, as an injury to the common intere&s;t of all kings, and an in&s;ult to every &s;overeign in particular. Eliza|beth a&s;king if he was charged to u&s;e &s;uch language, he an&s;wered in the affirma|tive. "Have you &s;uch orders under your ma&s;ter's hand," (&s;aid &s;he). He told her they were in letters written with the king's own hand: &s;he required him to avow this a&s;&s;ertion in writing; and he wrote without he&s;itation. She <NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte.</NOTE>

Notwithstanding the $ar$$ft manner in which Bellievre &s;ollicited for the life of the Scotti&s;h queen, he is &s;aid to have $$ho$ted Elizabeth in private to haften the execution of that prince&s;s; and &s;uch collu&s;ion is not at all impro|bable, when we con&s;ider Henry's implacable ani$$$ity to the duke of Gui&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> the kin&s;men of Mary queen of Scotland.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ar. Ch. 1987.</NOTE> The mini&s;try of England, in order to pave the way for the execu|tion of the Scotti&s;h queen, took care to alarm the nation with fal&s;e &s;urmi&s;es of new plots, and projected inva&s;ions. One Stafford being arre&s;ted on &s;u&s;picion of $word$ confe&s;&s;ed that he had conferred with De Trappes, &s;ecretary to $word$ the French amba&s;&s;ador in ordinary, about hiring a de&s;perado to murder the queen. De Trappes had &s;et out for Dover, in hope of overtaking Bellievre with &s;ome di&s;patches, when he was &s;eized upon the road, and con|veyed pri&s;oner to the Tower of London. Nothing material appearing in his papers, the council &s;ent for Chateauneuf, and taxed him with having been concerned in a con&s;piracy again&s;t the queen's life. Stafford being brought before the board, in&s;i&s;ted upon the amba&s;&s;ador's being privy to the de&s;ign; and his evidence was confirmed by Moody, the pretended a$$a$$in. Chateau|neuf owned that Stafford had mentioned &s;ome &s;uch project to him; but that he had turned him out of his hou&s;e, and threatened to deliver him into the hands of her maje&s;ty. The council reprimanded him &s;harply for having con|cealed &s;uch a trea&s;onable de&s;ign; and the queen complained of his conduct to Henry, by the mouth of the amba&s;&s;ador whom &s;he &s;ent to Paris immediately after the departure of Bellievre. By the&s;e complaints, and other pretences of de&s;igns formed again&s;t her life, &s;he eluded the &s;ollicitations of Henry in favour of the Scotti&s;h queen. Stafford's plot was devi&s;ed for the purpo&s;e. Rumours were rai&s;ed and indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated to frighten and provoke the people. A Spani&s;h fleet was &s;aid to have arrived in Milford-Haven. It was reported that the Scots had made an irruption into England; that the duke of Gui&s;e had landed with an army in Su&s;&s;ex; that the queen of Scots had e&s;caped from pri&s;on; that a rebellion was rai&s;ed in the north; and a new con&s;piracy hatched to murder the queen, and burn the city of London: nay, in &s;ome counties queen Elizabeth was believed to be already murdered. Such were the arts practi&s;ed by the mini&s;try, to excite a ferment in the nation, and exa&s;perate the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> &s;ubjects again&s;t the queen of Scots, as the cau&s;e of all the&s;e calamities.</P>

<P>James of Scotland was no &s;ooner informed of his mother's di&s;tre&s;s, than he di&s;patched W. Keith, gentleman of his bed-chamber, with a letter to Elizabeth, conjuring her to &s;pare the life of his parent, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould think him&s;elf bound by the laws of God and man to revenge her death; and be&s;$$ching her at any rate to re&s;pite the execution of the &s;entence, until he could &s;end an amba&s;&s;ador with further propo&s;itions, which &s;he might find &s;a|tisfactory. She was &s;eized with a tran&s;port of indignation when &s;he peru&s;ed this letter, in which James pre&s;umed to threaten her with vengeance; but her pa&s;|&s;ion &s;ub&s;iding, &s;he granted the de&s;ired re&s;pite. At length the ma&s;ter of Gray, and Sir Robert Melvil, arriving in London, propo&s;ed that their king &s;hould give the chief of his nobility as ho&s;tages, to &s;ecure Elizabeth from any future

practices of his mother, who &s;hould re&s;ign her right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to her &s;on; and this re&s;ignation &s;hould be guaranteed by foreign princes. The&s;e propo&s;als the queen rejected with di&s;dain; and, when Sir Robert Melvil begged earne&s;tly that the execution might be deferred for a week, &s;he an&s;wered with great emo|tion, "No; not for an hour." We have already ob&s;erved, that Elizabeth's di&s;&s;imulation failed her whenever Mary was the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation.

<P>Elizabeth now proceeded to act the la&s;t part of the tragedy relating to the unhappy queen of Scotland. In order to po&s;&s;e&s;s her people with an opinion of her clemency, and aver&s;ion to violent mea&s;ures, we have &s;een that &s;everal noblemen had thrown them&s;elves at her feet, be&s;eeching her to take pity upon them and their po&s;terity; and, by the death of Mary, provide for the &s;afety of religion and the realm. This farce they performed before the commi&s;&s;ion was expedited. After the &s;entence was pronounced, &s;he &s;uffered her&s;elf to be twice addre&s;&s;ed by the parliament, which even reproached her with having refu&s;ed her people ju&s;tice, becau&s;e &s;he delayed the execution of the &s;entence: &s;he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to circulate fal&s;e reports, and alarm the nation with imaginary dangers, before &s;he would &s;ign the death warrant; and, la&s;tly, &s;he contrived means for in&s;piring the people with a belief that this war|rant was executed without her knowledge, and contrary to her intention. She made u&s;e of Davi&s;on as her tool on this occa&s;ion. He had been lately ap|pointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate for the purpo&s;e. The queen, in &s;eeming terror at tho&s;e reports, which her own creatures had diffu&s;ed through the kingdom, delivered to Davi&s;on an order &s;igned with her own hand, and &s;ealed with her own &s;eal, to make out a warrant for the execution of Mary, under the &s;anction of the great &s;eal, and to keep it &s;ecret in his own cu&s;tody, until he &s;hould re|ceive further directions. Next morning &s;he &s;ent two gentlemen &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, to de&s;ire that Davi&s;on would not go to the chancellor until &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him: when he told her that the chancellor had already put the great &s;eal to the warrant, &s;he pretended to be di&s;&s;atisfied, and a&s;ked what need there was for &s;uch hurry? The order for the execution was directed to the earls of Shrew&s;bury, Derby, Kent, and Cumberland, who were ordered to &s;ee the queen of Scots beheaded in their pre&s;ence. Davi&s;on, who was well acquainted with the real &s;entiments of Elizabeth touching queen Mary, communicated what had pa&s;&s;ed to the members of the privy council, who unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved that the order &s;hould be put in execution. It was immediately delivered to Bea$e, who &s;um|moned the noblemen to whom it was directed, and &s;et out for Fotheringay with two executioners.</P>

<P>Mary heard the death-warrant read without exhibiting the lea&s;t marks of di&s;compo&s;ure; though &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urprize that the queen of England &s;hould con&s;ent to her being executed; and laying her hand on a New Te&s;ta|ment which happened to be upon the table, &s;he &s;olemnly prote&s;ted, that &s;he had never devi&s;ed, pur&s;ued, or con&s;ented to any de&s;ign again&s;t the per&s;on of Elizabeth. She denied her having had the lea&s;t concern in Babington's con|&s;piracy; and inquiring about the fate of Nau and Curle, a&s;ked whether it had ever been heard of before, that &s;ervants were &s;uborned and admitted as evi|dence again&s;t their ma&s;ter? She de&s;ired that her confe&s;&s;or might attend her;
<PB N="92" REF="940">
a favour which is granted to the wor&s;t malefactors, though now cruelly denied to the queen of Scotland. After the earls had retired, &s;he ate &s;paringly at &s;up|per; and her attendants weeping and lamenting her fate, &s;he comforted them with a che$rful countenance, telling them they ought not to mourn, but re|joice at the pro&s;pect of her &s;peedy deliverance from a world of mi&s;ery. The earl of Kent, who &s;eems to have hated her with an uncommon degree of rancour, had told her that her life was the death, and her death would be the life, of the prote&s;tant religion. Mary &s;eemed to triumph in this declaration, ob&s;erving to Burgoign her phy&s;ician, that it was a plain acknowledgment of her being put to death on account of religion, and not for any offence &s;he had committed again&s;t the per&s;on of Elizabeth. After &s;upper, &s;he reviewed her will, and peru&s;ed the inventory of her effects. The&s;e &s;he bequeathed to different individuals; and divided her money, which by this time &s;he had recovered, into a number of little pur&s;es, and di&s;tributed them among her &s;ervants, whom &s;he warmly recommended in letters to the king of France and the duke of Gui&s;e. Going to bed at her u&s;ual hour, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed part of the night in uninterrupted repo&s;e; then ri&s;ing, &s;pent the remainder in prayer and acts of devotion.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XI.</HEAD>
<P>On the day of her death, which was the eighth of February, &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with equal elegance and decorum, and cau&s;ing her will to be read in the hearing of her &s;ervants, de&s;ired they would take their legacies in good part, as her ability did not corre&s;pond with her wi&s;hes in their favour. When Thomas Andrews, high &s;heriff of the county, came to call her to execution, &s;he was employed in prayer. She came forth with a compo&s;ed countenance, and maje&s;tic demeanor, with a long veil of linnen on her head, and in her hand a crucifix of ivory. At the bottom of the &s;tairs, Sir Andrew Melvil, ma&s;ter of her hou&s;hold, fell upon his knees, and &s;hedding a flood of tears, lamented his misfortune in being doomed to carry the news of her un|happy fate to Scotland. "Lament not &s;aid $he$ but rather rejoice, that Mary Stuart will &s;oon be freed from all her cares. Tell my friends that I die con&s;tant in my religion, and firm in my fidelity and affection towards Scotland and France. God forgive them who have thir&s;ted after my blood, as the harts do after the water brooks. Thou, O God, who art truth it&s;elf, and perfectly under&s;tande&s;t the inward thoughts of my heart, knowe&s;t how greatly I have de&s;ired that the realms of England and Scotland might be united. Commend me to my &s;on, and a&s;&s;ure him I have done nothing pre|judicial to the &s;tate or crown of Scotland. Admoni&s;h him to pre&s;erve amity and friend&s;hip with the queen of England, and &s;ee that thou do him faithful &s;ervice." In this place &s;he was received by the four noblemen, who with great difficulty were prevailed upon to allow Melvil, with her phy&s;ician, apo|thecary, &s;urgeon, and two female attendants, to be pre&s;ent at the execution. Then the noblemen and the &s;heriff going before, and Melvil bearing up her train, &s;he walked to the &s;caffold, which was rai&s;ed about two feet from the floor of the hall, and furni&s;hed with a chair, a cu&s;hion, and a block, covered with black cloth. As &s;oon as &s;he had &s;eated her&s;elf, Beale began to read the warrant for her execution; then Fletcher, dean of Peterborough, &s;tanding without the rails, repeated a long exhortation, which &s;he interrupted twice, de&s;iring him to forbear, as &s;he was firmly re&s;olved to di$ in the Roman catho|lic religion. The lords indu&s;triou&s;ly tormented this poor lady in her la&s;t mo|ments.
<PB N="93" REF="950">
They ordered the dean to pray; and he proceeded, although &s;he told them that &s;he could not join with them, and had very little time to &s;pare for her own devotions. She therefore, with her &s;ervants, fell on her knees, and prayed aloud in Latin, from the office of the Virgin Mary. When the dean left off &s;peaking, &s;he prayed again in the Engli&s;h tongue, fervently recommending the church, her &s;on, and queen Elizabeth, to the protection of Almighty God. When her acts of devotion were fini&s;hed, &s;he ordered her women to undre&s;s her for the block; and the executioners rudely interfering, bade them &s;tand off, &s;aying, &s;he was not u&s;ed to undre&s;s her&s;elf before &s;o much company, nor ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;uch valets de chambre. Her two women bur&s;ting into tears, and loud exclamations of &s;orrow, &s;he reminded them, in the French language, of her having undertaken for their di&s;creet behaviour: &s;he embraced them ten|derly, bidding them forbear their womani&s;h lamentations, for now &s;he &s;hould re&s;t from all her &s;orrows; then turning to her men &s;ervants, who were over|whelmed with un&s;peakable affliction, &s;he, with a gracious &s;mile, bade them farewel. The two executioners kneeling, and asking her pardon, &s;he &s;aid &s;he forgave them, and all the authors of her death, as freely as &s;he wi&s;hed God would forgive her own tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. She once more made a &s;olemn prote&s;ta|tion of her innocence. Her eyes were covered with a linen handkerchief: &s;he laid her head upon the block without the lea&s;t mark of perturbation, recited a p&s;alm, and having repeated a pious ejaculation, received the fatal &s;troke. She was cruelly mangled by the executioner, who having at length &s;evered her head from her body, and holding it up in his hand, the dean of Peter|borough exclaimed, "So let all queen Elizabeth's enemies peri&s;h." The earl of Kent an&s;wered, Amen; while the re&s;t of the &s;pectators wept and &s;ighed at this affecting &s;pectacle. Her women begged they might be allowed to per|form the la&s;t offices to their dead mi&s;tre&s;s, offering to pay thrice the value of what remained about her breathle&s;s cor&s;e; but their reque&s;t was denied: they were roughly commanded to be gone, and the body was left to the di&s;cretion of the executioners, by whom it was indecently &s;tripped, and carried into an adjoining room, where they covered it with a coar&s;e ru&s;&s;et cloth belonging to an old billiard-table. It was afterwards imbalmed, inclo&s;ed in a leaden coffin, and interred with great pomp and &s;olemnity in the cathedral of Peterborough; from whence her &s;on James removed it, in the &s;equel, to the chapel of Henry VII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spotti&s;wood.

<P>Such was the untimely fate of Mary Stuart, a prince&s;s unmatched in beauty, and unequalled in misfortune. Perhaps the charms of her per|&s;on, and the accompli&s;hments of her &s;ex, in which &s;he far out&s;hone all her co|temporaries, contributed as much to her ruin, as did her title to the crown of England, which is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the cau&s;e of her death. Elizabeth was a woman as well as a politician. She not only dreaded Mary as<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> the rival of her dignity, but al&s;o envied her &s;uperior qualifications. Though other motives influenced her mini&s;try again&s;t that prince&s;s, the queen of Eng|land &s;eems to have been in a great mea&s;ure actuated by per&s;onal malice, founded upon the re&s;ult of a compari&s;on between her own character and that of the all-accompli&s;hed Mary queen of Scots. This was the original grudge upon which all her future rancour was grafted; for after Mary had been de|tained nineteen years in captivity; after tho&s;e con&s;piracies which had been
<PB N="94" REF="960">
formed in her behalf by the fir&s;t noblemen in England, were utterly cru&s;hed and extinguished, and Elizabeth's throne e&s;tabli&s;hed upon univer&s;al popularity; while &s;he lived in harmony with the king of France, found employment for Philip in the Netherlands, and her kingdom was altogether free from di&s;tur|bance or commotion, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he really thought her&s;elf in danger from the machinations of her pri&s;oner. Had &s;he had been guided by political views only, perhaps &s;he would have relea&s;ed the queen of Scots in the beginning of her captivity. In that ca&s;e &s;he would have been exempted from the danger of tho&s;e commotions which were excited by her impri&s;onment; and the factions would have been continued in Scotland, where &s;he might have ea&s;ily managed both &s;ides for her own advantage. Mary queen of Scots, bating &s;ome acts of indi&s;cretion, excu&s;able from her youth and inexperience, was a lady po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t amiable virtues: over and above her amazing beauty, and the exqui&s;ite &s;ymmetry of her per&s;on, &s;he was learned, penetrating, invincibly &s;ecret, liberal, charitable, unaffectedly pious, meek, affable, mag|nanimous, and endowed with &s;uch fortitude as no adver&s;ity could di&s;compo&s;e.</P>

<P>When the tidings of Mary's death were brought to queen Eliza|beth, &s;he affected to expre&s;s the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, with all the marks of extravagant &s;orrow. She commanded the members of the council to quit her pre&s;ence; and Davi&s;on to be pro&s;ecuted in the Star-chamber. She wept, wailed, and lamented the hard fate of her dear kin&s;woman. She di&s;patched her relation Robert Cary with a letter to James king of Scotland, expre&s;&s;ing her incomparable grief of mind at the lamentable accident which had hap|pened, contrary to her intention; and profe&s;&s;ing the warme&s;t regard and af|fection for him and his concerns. The Scotti&s;h king breathed nothing but revenge again&s;t tho&s;e who had brought his mother to the block. He would not admit Cary into his kingdom; but &s;ent Sir George Hume, and the ma&s;ter of Melvil, to receive his letter on the border. He was not &s;atisfied with Eli|zabeth's apology, nor the confinement of Davi&s;on, whom &s;he had ordered to be pro&s;ecuted in the Star-chamber. The e&s;tates of Scotland meeting at Edin|burgh, promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t their &s;overeign in revenging his mother's death, with their lives and fortunes. But the queen of England had emi&s;&s;aries in the court of James, who found no difficulty in appearing his indignation. They appealed to his prevailing pa&s;&s;ions of fear and vanity. They repre&s;ented the danger of engaging in a war with England, a rich, powerful nation, able to cru&s;h him in one campaign; and the folly of incen&s;ing a people over whom he had the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of reigning, provided he &s;hould not provoke them to take &s;ome &s;tep to the prejudice of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. By &s;uch remon&s;trances, he was di&s;&s;uaded from commencing ho&s;tilities, until the arrival of lord Hun&s;|don as amba&s;&s;ador from England, a nobleman for whom he had a particular regard, and by whom he was ea&s;ily prevailed upon to lay a&s;ide all re&s;olutions<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$mden.</NOTE> of revenge.</P>

<P>Davi&s;on was the &s;acrifice offered up to the re&s;entment of the Scotti&s;h monarch. That &s;ecretary was accu&s;ed before the Star-chamber, of having contemned the queen's orders, violated his oath of fidelity, and neglected the duties of his office. He &s;aid he would rather be found guilty than pre&s;ume to con$$&s;t with her maje&s;ty; prote&s;ted, that if he had erred, he had erred through ignorance only, and a full per&s;ua&s;ion that what he did was agreeable to

the queen's inte$tion. He therefore $ubmitted to the judgment of the council, was &s;entenced to pay a fine of ten thou&s;and pounds, and remain in pri&s;on during her maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure. He begged they would intercede in his behalf, that he might be re&s;tored to the queen's favour; which, however, he did not retrieve, but langui&s;hed a long time in confinement, during which $he &s;ome|times relieved his nece&s;&s;ities. While he remained in cu&s;tody he wrote an apo|logy, addre&s;&s;ed to Wal&s;ingham, to the following effect: That before the de|parture of the French and Scotti&s;h amba&s;&s;adors, he delivered into the queen's own hand, the order for the execution of Mary, which &s;he immediately $igned, de&s;iring it might receive the &s;anction of the great &s;eal. Then &s;he $ade him &s;hew it to Wal&s;ingham, who was already &s;ick, &s;aying, in deri&s;ion, he would certainly die at &s;ight of the warrant. She ob&s;erved &s;he had delayed it hitherto, that &s;he might not be thought to act with violence; but there was a nece&s;&s;ity for its being executed. She broke forth into pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t Sir Amias Paulet, and Sir Drue Drury, becau&s;e they had not &s;pared her this trouble, and de&s;ired that Wal&s;ingham would feel their pul&s;es touching the af|fair. Next day, when &s;he under&s;tood that the great &s;eal was affixed, &s;he blamed Davi&s;on for his precipitation, &s;aying, a better cour&s;e might be taken. To which hint the &s;ecretary replied, that the ju&s;te&s;t cour&s;e was always the be&s;t. Fearing, however, that &s;he would lay the whole blame upon him, as &s;he had formerly imputed the death of the duke of Norfolk to lord Burghley, he communicated the whole tran&s;action to Sir Chri&s;topher Hatton, by whom it was imparted to Burghley. This nobleman laid it before the re&s;t of the council, who unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to ha&s;ten the execution, and bear an equal &s;hare of the blame: then Beale was di&s;patched with the warrant and letters. On the third day after this re&s;olution, Elizabeth relating a dream about Mary's death, Davi&s;on asked if &s;he had changed her mind: &s;he an&s;wered, No; but another cour&s;e might have been devi&s;ed; and de&s;ired to know if he had received any an&s;wer from Paulet. He produced the letter, in which that gentleman &s;tatly refu&s;ed to undertake any thing which &s;hould be incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice and honour. Then &s;he exclaimed, in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, again&s;t the nicene&s;s of tho&s;e preci&s;e fellows who promi&s;ed mighty matters, but indeed would perform nothing for her &s;afety. She accu&s;ed them of perjury, in the breach of their a&s;&s;ociation-vow; and ob&s;erved, that there were &s;ome per&s;ons who would &s;till do it for her &s;ake. Davi&s;on repre&s;ented the inju&s;tice and di&s;honour of &s;uch proceedings, expatiated upon the danger that would accrue to her reputation, and told her that the council had already taken order in the affair. He likewi&s;e declared, that on the very day of Mary's death, &s;he had chid him, becau&s;e the queen of Scots was not yet executed. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE></P>

<P>The parliament meeting on the fifteenth day of February, a motion was made in the hou&s;e of commons, to pre&s;ent an addre&s;s of thanks to her maje&s;ty, for having put the queen of Scots to death: but this did not pa&s;s, be|cau&s;e it would have fixed upon Elizabeth an imputation which &s;he &s;ought &s;o eagerly to avoid. A petition, with a Directory, or book of di&s;cipline, from the Puritans, being pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e, and &s;econded by four gentlemen, the queen &s;ent for the book, and committed the four members to the Tower, for having pre&s;umed to meddle in church-matters, in contempt of her repeated inhibition.

<P>Such a &s;upply was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent the ruin of the confederates in the Low-Countries. Leice&s;ter, during his admini&s;tration, had not only exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t arbitrary and de&s;potic power, but al&s;o encouraged factions, which had well nigh de&s;troyed the union of the provinces. Stanley and York, whom he had appointed governors of Zutphen and Deventer, be|trayed their tru&s;t, and &s;urrendered their $orts to the prince of Parma; and the &s;tates fearing that all the other Engli&s;h governors of his nomination would follow their treacherous example, elected prince Maurice provi&s;ionally $tadt|holder and governor-general in his ab&s;ence. Then they wrote a letter to Eli|zabeth, complaining that Leice&s;ter had i&s;&s;ued placarts again&s;t trade, and com|mitted their towns to the charge of &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, protected traitors, and re&s;trained the power of the &s;tates. Lord Buckhur&s;t was &s;ent over to compro|mi&s;e the quarrel; and then they extended the lift of their grievances again&s;t the earl of Leice&s;ter. They taxed him with having refu&s;ed in&s;tructions; nominated coun&s;ellors of &s;tate; quartered his own arms on the &s;eal of the &s;tates; coined ro&s;e nobles, to pa&s;s for double their intrin&s;ic value; in&s;tituted a new court of exchequer; filled the colleges of the admiralty with unqualified per&s;ons; hindered the levy of &s;ix thou&s;and Germans; and excited the common people again&s;t the magi&s;trates. Elizabeth was not plea&s;ed with the&s;e complaints, which produced an animo&s;ity between Leice&s;ter and Buckhur&s;t. Sir John Norreys was recalled: the Engli&s;h troops were greatly dimini&s;hed, and &s;tarving for want of pay; Gueldres was betrayed to the enemy, and the prince of Parma had inve&s;ted Sluys. The queen di&s;patched Leice&s;ter with five thou&s;and men to the relief of this place, which, however, he could not &s;uccour; and therefore marched into Zealand, where he renewed his old prac|tices, while Sluys was obliged to capitulate. The earl having rendered him|&s;elf extremely odious to the people and the &s;tates of the Netherlands, re&s;olved to employ force in the execution of his projects. His de&s;ign was to appre|hend and put to death John Olden Barneylt, and thirteen other &s;trenuous op|po&s;ers of his arbitrary mea&s;ures, and to &s;eize Dort, Enckhui&s;en, Leyden, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$mden. $word$ Grot$$s.</NOTE> other places: but his de&s;ign being di&s;covered, the queen recalled him to England, obliged him to re&s;ign his government, and &s;ent over the lord Wil|loughby to command the Engli&s;h forces.</P>

<P>Elizabeth having been apprized in the beginning of the year that Philip of Spain had begun to make preparations for invading England, &s;ent Sir Francis Drake with a fleet of &s;hips to de&s;troy his ve&s;&s;els, and intercept his provi&s;ions. This commander &s;unk two gallies in the bay of Cadiz, took, burned, and de&s;troyed, an hundred $e&s;&s;els loaded with provi&s;ions, and $word$ of war, together with a galeon of fourteen hundred tons belonging to the marquis of Santa Cruz; and another of Ragu$a, loaden with merchandize.

After the&s;e exploits, Drake &s;ailed to the Azores, and in his way took the St. Philip, a carrack of enormous bulk, re|turning from the Ea&s;t Indies, richly laden.

<P>The&s;e depredations &s;erved only to &s;timulate Philip in his prepa|rations<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He re|&s;olved therefore to make a conque&s;t of England, which being an open country, without fortified towns, mu&s;t at once fall to him who &s;hould conquer in the field. He procured from the pope a con&s;ecrated banner, with fre&s;h bulls for excommunicating Elizabeth as an heretic, publi&s;hing a cru&s;ade again&s;t her, and ab&s;olving her &s;ubjects from their oath of allegiance. He pretended to be the next catholic heir to the crown of England, as a de&s;cendant from the two daughters of John of Gaunt, duke of Lanca&s;ter; and he determined to di&s;|embark his forces at the mouth of the river Thames, in the neighbourhood of London. For the purpo&s;es of this expedition, he equipped one hundred and thirty &s;hips, manned with nineteen thou&s;and two hundred and ninety &s;oldiers, eight thou&s;and three hundred and fifty &s;eamen, two thou&s;and and eighty galley|&s;laves, and mounted with two thou&s;and three hundred and &s;ixty pieces of can|non. The duke of Parma was ordered to provide tran&s;ports, and an army of five and twenty thou&s;and men, to be conveyed to England as &s;oon as the Spani&s;h fleet &s;hould appear on the coa&s;t of Flanders. The duke, in pur&s;uance of his orders, cau&s;ed a great number of large flat-bottomed ve&s;&s;els to be built for the tran&s;portation of the cavalry; provided other &s;hips for the foot &s;oldiers, and quartered his troops in the neighbourhood of Gravelines, Dunkirk, and New|port; &s;even hundred Engli&s;h fugitives having inli&s;ted under his banner, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the conque&s;t of their own country.</P>

<P>Elizabeth having learned the particulars of this formidable arma|ment, which was &s;tiled the Invincible Armada, took the nece&s;&s;ary precautions for giving the Spaniards a warm reception. Having equipped a con&s;iderable flcet, &s;he created Charles lord Howard of Effingham lord admiral of England; and he was &s;ent with a &s;trong &s;quadron to the we&s;t, where he was joined by Sir Francis Drake, now appointed vice-admiral. She ordered lord Henry Sey|mour, &s;econd &s;on to the duke of Somer&s;et, to cruize along the coa&s;t of Flan|ders, with forty Engli&s;h and Flemi&s;h &s;hips, to prevent the prince of Parma from putting to &s;ea with his forces. Twenty thou&s;and men were cantoned along the &s;outhern coa&s;ts of England; another body of well-di&s;ciplined troops encamped at Tilbury, near the mouth of the Thames, under the con|duct of the earl of Leice&s;ter, whom the queen created general in chief of all her forces; and the lord Hun&s;don commanded a third army, amounting to &s;ix and thirty thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot, for the defence of her maje&s;ty's per&s;on. Arthur lord Gray, Sir Francis Knotles, Sir John Norreys, Sir Richard Bingham, and Sir Roger Williams, men renowned for their valour and experience, were con|&s;ulted about the management of the war by land. In pur&s;uance of their ad|vice, all the landing-places on the coa&s;t were fortified and garri&s;oned, from Hull to the Land's end, and Milford Haven: the militia of the country was
<PB N="98" REF="1000">
armed, and regulated under proper officers, who received in&s;tructions for interrupting the di&s;embarkation of the enemy, wa&s;ting the country before them, and amu&s;ing them with flight skirmi&s;hes and continual alarms, until the army could be a&s;&s;embled at the place, in order to give them battle. The queen impri&s;oned &s;ome &s;u&s;pected papi&s;ts; &s;ent new in&s;tructions to Sir William Fitzwilliams lord deputy of Ireland; and, by her friends in Scotland, in&s;tigated James again&s;t the Roman catholics and the Spani&s;h faction. That prince was more afraid than &s;he, of the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch an inva&s;ion, which would have deprived him of his fair &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and expo&s;ed his native kingdom to the arms of a foreign conqueror.

<P>Philip and Elizabeth, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e preparations for offence and defence, endeavoured to amu&s;e each other with a negotiation, to gain time, until the one &s;hould be able to &s;trike, and the other to ward off the in|tended blow. The duke of Parma having received a commi&s;&s;ion for treating, the Engli&s;h envoys repaired to O&s;tend, although the e&s;tates of the Netherlands had refu&s;ed to concur in the treaty, and the conferences were opened at Bour|bourg. The Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners propo&s;ed a truce, which was rejected. Then they de&s;ired that the antient alliance &s;hould be renewed between Eng|land and the hou&s;e of Burgundy; that all the foreign troops &s;hould be with|drawn from the Low-Countries; that the people &s;hould be &s;ecured in their liberties, and indulged with a toleration in matters of religion; and that the money which queen Elizabeth had lent them &s;hould be repayed by the king of Spain. The debates upon the&s;e articles were &s;pun out, until the Spani&s;h Armada appeared in the channel; and then the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a &s;afe-conduct to Calais.</P>

<P>Alonzo Perez de Guzman, duke of Medina Sidonia, commander of the Spani&s;h fleet, had &s;ailed from Li&s;bon on the twenty-ninth day of May; but being overtaken by a &s;torm, the &s;hips were di&s;per&s;ed, though, in few days, they re-a&s;&s;embled at Corunna, and in the neighbouring harbours. Ef|fingham, the Engli&s;h admiral, having received an exaggerated account of the damage received by the Spani&s;h navy, &s;et &s;ail towards Spain, with a view to attack and de&s;troy them in their harbours; but the wind &s;hifting, he returned to Plymouth, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they might chu&s;e this favourable gale to enter the Engli&s;h channel while he was ab&s;ent. This was really the ca&s;e: they had probably pa&s;&s;ed him in a fog; for on the very day after his return to port, being the nineteenth of July, the Spani&s;h fleet was &s;een off the Lizard, on the coa&s;t of Cornwal. The admiral forthwith ordered his &s;hips to be towed out to &s;ea, again&s;t a &s;trong breeze that blew in &s;hore; and then he de&s;cried the Armada &s;ailing up the channel in line of battle, like &s;o many lofty ca&s;tles floating on the bo&s;om of the &s;ea. He allowed them to pa&s;s, that he might have the advantage of the wind, and di&s;patched his brother-in-law Sir Edward Hoby to court for a further &s;upply of men and &s;hipping. Upon this occa&s;ion many noblemen, and per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by fitting out &s;hips at their own expence, and engaging as volunteers in the &s;er|vice
<PB N="99" REF="1010">
of their country. Among the&s;e were the earls of Oxford, Northumber|land, and Cumberland, Sir Thomas and Sir Robert Cecil, and the celebrated Sir Walter Raleigh. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of July, the admiral, &s;econded by Drake, Hawkins, and Forbi&s;her, attacked the rear of the Armada, com|manded by John Martinez de Recalde, and maintained the engagement about two hours, pouring in their broad-&s;ides, and tacking about with admirable dexterity. They did not chu&s;e to engage the enemy more clo&s;ely, becau&s;e they were greatly inferior to the Spaniards in the number of &s;hips, guns, men, and in weight of metal; nor could they pretend to board &s;uch lofty &s;hips, without a manife&s;t di&s;advantage, Neverthele&s;s, two Spani&s;h gall$ons were di&s;abled and taken. On the twenty-third day of July, the duke of Medina Sidonia bore down upon the Engli&s;h fleet, and both &s;ides &s;trove for &s;ome time to gain the weather-gage: at length the battle began, and was fought with great confu|&s;ion and various &s;ucce&s;s; though the lo&s;s on either &s;ide was not con&s;iderable. This engagement was followed by a ce&s;&s;ation, becau&s;e the lord admiral could not renew ho&s;tilities, until he received a &s;upply of powder and ammunition. On the twenty-fifth, a Portugue&s;e galleon was taken, notwith&s;tanding the vigorous efforts of Don Diego Telles Enriquez, who brought three galea&s;&s;es to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. On the twenty-&s;eventh, the Armada anchored before Calais, and were again attacked by the Engli&s;h fleet, now reinforced, and amounting to one hundred and forty &s;hips, well manned and provided for action. The Spani&s;h admiral pre&s;&s;ed the duke of Parma for a reinforcement of forty fly|boats, that he might be the better enabled to deal with the light Engli&s;h fri|gates; and he did not doubt but by this time the Netherland forces were em|barked for the de&s;cent upon England. The duke was not at all prepared to join the Armada. His ve&s;&s;els were leaky, and de&s;$itute of provi&s;ions; the greater part of his &s;eamen had de&s;erted; the troops were not yet embarked; and the harbours of Dunkirk and Nieuport were blocked up by a &s;quadron of &s;hips belonging to Holland and Zealand. After lord Effingham had can|nonaded the Armada for &s;ome time, he prepared eight fire-&s;hips; and at mid|night &s;ent them, under the conduct of Young and Prow&s;e, into the mid&s;t of the enemy, where, being &s;et on fire, they produced univer&s;al terror and con|fu&s;ion. The duke of Medina Sidonia ordered his captains to &s;lip their cables, and put to &s;ea with all expedition. They practi&s;ed this expedient, but with &s;uch di&s;order, that they ran foul of each other in the dark; and their whole navy was filled with tumult and uproar. A large galea&s;s, commanded by Don Hugo de Moncada, having lo&s;t her rudder, next day &s;truck upon the &s;ands of Calais, and was, after a very de&s;perate engagement, taken by three Engli&s;h captains, who found on board a great quantity of gold, and de|livered the ve&s;&s;el and guns as a perqui&s;ite to the governor of Calais. The Engli&s;h fleet taking the advantage of the enemy's confu&s;ion, engaged them with great fury, as they endeavoured to re-a&s;&s;emble off Gravelines. The en|gagement<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meteren. Carte.</NOTE> began at four o'clock in the morning, and la&s;ted till &s;ix in the evening. The Engli&s;h having the advantage of wind and tide, handled them &s;o roughly, that thirteen of their be&s;t &s;hips were either &s;unk or driven a&s;hore; one of their galleons was taken, and another fell into the hands of the Zealanders. The duke of Medina Sidonia being driven towards the coa&s;t of Zealand, held a council of war, in which it was re&s;olved, that, as their
<PB N="100" REF="1020">
ammunition began to fail, their &s;hips had received great damage, and they di&s;|paired of being joined by the duke of Parma, they &s;hould return to Spain, by failing round the Orkneys, the Hebrides, and the i&s;land of Ireland. Ac|cordingly they proceeded to the northward, and were followed by the Engli&s;h fleet as far as Flamborough-head, where they came up with the fugitives; and the Spani&s;h admiral, intimidated by the pro&s;pect of a long and dangerous voy|age, would have &s;urrendered, had he been attacked by the Engli&s;h navy. But, a council being called by lord Effingham to regulate the particulars of the en|gagement, it appeared upon inquiry, that their ammunition was almo&s;t ex|hau&s;ted; &s;o that they were obliged to let the Spani&s;h $$eet proceed on their voyage, while they returned to the Downs. That very night the Armada was terribly &s;hattered in a &s;torm. Seventeen of the &s;hips, having five thou&s;and men on board, were afterwards ca&s;t away upon the we&s;tern i&s;les, and the coa&s;t of Ireland. Some were wrecked on the rocks of Norway, and many peri&s;hed by fire, and other accidents. Seven hundred Spaniards landing in Scotland, were treated with humanity by James; and, with the con&s;ent of Elizabeth, &s;ent over to the duke of Parma in the Netherlands; but tho&s;e who got a&s;hore in Ireland, were butchered by the natives, or the lord deputy. Of the whole Armada, three and fifty &s;hips only returned to Spain, in a mi&s;erable condition; and the commanders imputed their ill &s;ucce&s;s to their not being joined by the duke of Parma, and their being too &s;everely re&s;tricted to the letter of their in&s;tructions.</P>

<P>The Engli&s;h &s;truck two medals to perpetuate the memory of the Ar|mada's mi&s;carriage; and the king of Spain bore his di&s;appointment with great fortitude. He ordered a general thank&s;giving to God and the &s;aints, that the misfortune was not greater; and treated the &s;oldiers and &s;eamen with uncommon humanity. Nor was Elizabeth backward in acknowledging the divine pro|tection, in public prayer and thank&s;giving. She had animated the army at Tilbury with her pre&s;ence; and now made a &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion in triumph through the city of London. She rewarded the lord admiral with a pen&s;ion: &s;he &s;ent Sir Robert Sydney as her amba&s;&s;ador to James of Scotland, to thank that monarch for the alacrity with which he had offered his a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Spaniards, and to amu&s;e him with promi&s;es which were never performed: but her joy was interrupted by the death of her favourite Leice&s;ter, who was &s;eized with a fever, and expired at Cornbury-lodge in Oxford&s;hire, when the patent was actually drawn for creating him queen's lieutenant, in the govern|ment<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$nde$.</NOTE> of England and Ireland. Notwith&s;tanding her &s;orrow for this event, &s;he ordered his effects to be &s;old at public auction, to pay his debts to the crown. After all the encomiums which have been be&s;towed upon Elizabeth for her conduct, in the precautions taken again&s;t the Spani&s;h armament, &s;he certainly hazarded the &s;afety of her kingdom, by her par&s;imonious di&s;po&s;ition, and blind attachment to this favourite: for her &s;hips were very poorly &s;upplied with ammunition and provi&s;ion; and her captain-general by land was utterly devoid of courage, conduct, experience, and di&s;cretion. In&s;tead of protecting and &s;ecuring the union of the e&s;tates of the Low-Countries, by a &s;age and upright admini&s;tration, he had kindled di&s;&s;en&s;ions among them, which were not extingui&s;hed at his death; and the&s;e prevented them from profiting by the

Before Leice&s;ter died, the Puritans were by his encouragement grown to an intolerable degree of in&s;olence. They publi&s;hed &s;currilous libels again&s;t the liturgy and con&s;titution of the church, and even &s;et up the pre&s;byterian form of di&s;cipline in &s;everal counties. In France the duke of Gui&s;e was become &s;o powerful and popular, that he in&s;ti|gated the Pari&s;ians to make barricadoes in their &s;treets, and prepare for at|tacking the king in his palace of the Louvre; &s;o that Henry was obliged to quit his capital, and make a di&s;honourable peace with the chiefs of the league: but, in the month of December, he revenged this outrage upon the duke, and his brother the cardinal, whom he cau&s;ed to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated at Blois; an act of barbarity which produced an open rebellion of the League, and the city of Paris. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mezera$$</NOTE></P>

<P>Elizabeth now enjoyed &s;uch tranquillity as she had not known &s;ince her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne. Her formidable rival was no more. The king of Spain was di&s;abled from pro&s;ecuting his re&s;entment; the affairs of the &s;tates in the Low-Countries began to a&s;&s;ume a more favourable a&s;pect, under the wi&s;e conduct of count Maurice; and the king of Scots was entirely go|verned by tho&s;e who received pen&s;ions from England. He had &s;ent amba&s;|&s;adors to Denmark, to treat of a marriage with the elde&s;t daughter of that mo|narch; but his chancellor Maitland, who was influenced by Elizabeth, limited the powers of the envoys in &s;uch a manner, that the Dani&s;h king imagining they wanted to trifle with him, be&s;towed the prince&s;s upon the duke of Brun&s;|wick. The queen of England had recommended the &s;i&s;ter of Henry king of Navarre as a wife to James, who &s;ent the lord Tungland into France, on pretence of negotiating an affair with her brother, though in reality to &s;ee and make a report of Catherine. The de&s;ign of Elizabeth was to protract the treaty about this match as long as &s;he could &s;tart objections: for &s;he imagined that James would not be &s;o ea&s;ily managed were he once married to a woman of &s;en&s;e and di&s;cernment, or connected by &s;uch an alliance with a prince of power and capacity.</P>

They had di&s;patched colonel Sempil to &s;ollicit Philip for another inva&s;ion: Bothwell undertook to &s;eize the king's per&s;on; but was di&s;appointed; the other three advanced with a body of forces towards Aber|deen; but the king a&s;&s;embling a greater number of troops, they were obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, and remained in cu&s;tody, until the new queen ar|rived in Scotland.

<P>Though Elizabeth was thus enabled to carry the war into Spain, &s;he did not think proper to ri&s;que her &s;ub&s;idies upon the precarious i&s;&s;ue of an expen&s;ive expedition. Don Antonio, prior of Crato, had arrived in England, and &s;ollicited her for &s;upplies to a&s;&s;ert his title to the crown of Portugal. As Philip continued to oppre&s;s that nation, this was judged a favourable con|juncture for rai&s;ing Don Antonio to the throne. Sir Francis Drake, and Sir John Norreys, undertook his re&s;toration, as private adventurers; the queen permitting them to rai&s;e forces, and equip a fleet, which was joined by &s;ix &s;hips of her navy. The emperor of Morocco, jealous of Philip's power, pro|mi&s;ed to lend two hundred thou&s;and crowns to Don Antonio, who &s;ent his own &s;on to Fez, as an ho&s;tage for the repayment of the money: but the Moor did not perform his promi&s;e, becau&s;e Philip delivered into his hands the fortre&s;s of Arzila. Drake and Norreys having embarked about twelve thou|&s;and &s;oldiers and &s;ailors, &s;et &s;ail in April from Plymouth, with a fleet of one hundred and forty-&s;ix ve&s;&s;els, and landing near Ferrol, inve&s;ted Corunna. They took the lower town by a&s;&s;ault; but the upper part, &s;ituated on a rock, they could not reduce for want of artillery. The count de Andrada marching to its relief with a body of eight thou&s;and men, they rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and at|tacked him at the bridge of Burgus, where he was defeated. The troops being greatly dimini&s;hed by an epidemical di&s;temper, they reimbarked, and &s;teering towards the coa&s;t of Portugal, were joined by the earl of E&s;&s;ex, and Sir Ro|ger Williams, with a regiment. The fir&s;t had &s;tole from court without the queen's knowledge. Landing again near Peniche, they reduced that place, and marching to Li&s;bon, entered the &s;uburbs of that city; but the town being defended by a &s;trong garri&s;on of Spaniards, the mortality &s;till raging among the Engli&s;h troops, and not a &s;oul &s;tirring in behalf of Don Antonio, they proceeded to Ca&s;caes, which Drake had taken, and having &s;eized three&s;core ve&s;&s;els laden with corn, belonging to the Han&s;e towns, reimbarked for England.

<P>The Han&s;e towns &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to complain of Drake's having &s;eized their &s;hips; but, in&s;tead of receiving &s;atisfaction, the Engli&s;h mini&s;try gave them to under&s;tand, that in the patent granted to them by Ed|ward III. it was expre&s;ly &s;tipulated, That they &s;hould not trade to any country openly at war with England; that provi&s;ions were contraband, and &s;ubject to confi&s;cation; and that they had no rea&s;on to complain of the capture of their ve&s;&s;els, as the queen had cautioned them again&s;t importing &s;uch provi&s;ion into Spain and Portugal. This year was not le&s;s remarkable in France than the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> former had been in England. Henry III. &s;eeing him&s;elf in danger of being oppre&s;&s;ed by the League, called in the king of Navarre and the Huguenots to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e auxiliaries enabled him to form the blockade of Paris, with an army of eight and thirty thou&s;and men; and he was on the point of reducing the place, when he was &s;tabbed by Jaques Clement, a Jacobin friar. In his la&s;t moments he declared the king of Navarre his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and that prince a&s;&s;umed the name of Henry IV. Though his Swi&s;s troops, and &s;ome of the French nobility, took the oath of allegiance to the new monarch, he was de&s;erted by the duke D'Epernon, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction; di&s;owned by the League as an heretic, and in danger of being abandoned by the Hugue|nots, who perceived him wavering in his religion.</P>

<P>In this emergency, he retired to Normandy with &s;even thou&s;and men; the duke de Mayenne pur&s;uing him with a numerous army. At length he was reduced to the alternative of making a &s;tand at Arques again&s;t four times the number of his troops, or of embarking for Dieppe and taking re|fuge in England. He had already &s;ollicited &s;uccours from Elizabeth; and, in hope of their &s;peedy arrival, re&s;olved to bear the brunt of an attack from the duke de Mayenne, general of the League, who was repul&s;ed with con&s;ider|able lo&s;s.

<P>Philip king of Spain in&s;i&s;ted upon being declared protector of France, in con&s;ideration of the &s;uccours he had granted to the League; and his party in that kingdom was &s;o &s;trong, that the duke de Mayenne, not daring to oppo&s;e his demand directly, found &s;ome difficulty in delaying the nomina|tion, until the arrival of the pope's legate, who would in all probability claim it for his holine&s;s. In the mean time, this general recovered Pontoi&s;e, and inve&s;ted Meulan; the &s;iege of which, however, the king obliged him to rai&s;e. Henry, in his turn, &s;at down before Dreux; and the duke, reinforced with two thou&s;and Spani&s;h hor&s;e under count Egmont, pa&s;&s;ed the Seine, in order to
<PB N="104" REF="1060">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$ $word$ 1$90.</NOTE> relieve the place. The king met him near Ivry, and an ob&s;tinate battle en|&s;uing$ gained a complete victory; after which he advanced to Paris, and tried to reduce it by famine. Thirteen thou&s;and of the inhabitants actually died of hunger: but Henry, through a princely exce&s;s of genero&s;ity and com|pa&s;&s;ion, allowed all the old men, women, and children, to pa&s;s in $a$ety through his camp; &s;o that the place, di&s;encumbered of &s;o many u&s;ele&s;s mouths, was enabled to hold out till the latter end of Augu&s;t, when the duke of<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> Parma marched with the Spani&s;h army from the Netherlands to its relief. His arrival obliged Henry to rai&s;e the blockade; but the duke avoided a battle, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> retreated immediately to the Low-Countries. Neverthele&s;s, the king's intere&s;t gained ground; his cau&s;e was e&s;pou&s;ed by the chief of the nobility, and the League was not a little di&s;concerted by the death of their titular king the old cardinal of Bourbon. At the &s;ame time Henry was &s;upplied by the queen of England with &s;ums of money for levying German auxiliaries under the prince of Anhalt: yet &s;he was too good an occonomi&s;t to lend money without &s;uffi|cient &s;ecurity, if &s;uch &s;ecurity could be obtained. Henry's agents found means to &s;atisfy her in this particular. In the Netherlands &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed O&s;tend$ be&s;ides the other cautionary towns, for the &s;ums &s;he had advanced to the &s;tates of Brabant and Flanders. She involved her&s;elf in no unnece&s;&s;ary expence: &s;he lived in a very penurious manner; &s;o that very few even of her own countiers ta&s;ted her bounty; and &s;he found means to annoy the public enemy at the ex|pence of private adventurers. We have &s;een how Drake harra&s;&s;ed the Spa|niards, both in the European &s;eas and in America: at this period the earl of Cumberland failing to the Azores, took and demoli&s;hed the ca&s;tle of Fayal, and brought home a great number of rich prizes.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year, &s;ome di&s;turbances happened in Ire|land, partly owing to the ferocity of the natives, and partly occa&s;ioned by the oppre&s;&s;ive conduct of Fitzwilliams the lord deputy. The earl of Tiroen having cau&s;ed Hugh Gavilloch, the natural &s;on of Shan O Neale, to be &s;trangled, was &s;ummoned to England, where he obtained the queen's pardon, upon his &s;olemnly engaging that he would live in peace with Tirlogh Lei|nigh, and all his neighbours; that he would not a&s;&s;ume the title of O Neale, im|po&s;e taxes, exerci&s;e any juri&s;diction, intercept ammunition or provi&s;ions intended for the u&s;e of the Engli&s;h garri&s;ons, nor admit into his territories monks, friars, or malecontents. This nobleman was very punctual in fulfilling his engage|ments, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many excellent qualifications, both of mind and body. Hugh Ro$ Mac Mahon, a powerful lord in Monaghan, having exacted the tax called Bonaghty from the people, according to the cu&s;tom of Ireland, was ap|prehended by order of the lord deputy, tried by a jury of common &s;oldiers, condemned, executed, and his e&s;tate divided between &s;ome of his own &s;ept and the Engli&s;h &s;ettlers.

He was under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of conquering all France, and the catholic noblemen in his army ferved him with reluctance; nay, even upon the expre&s;s condition that he &s;hould be in&s;tructed in &s;uch a manner as would induce him to change his religion. In this nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs, he had recour&s;e to Elizabeth, and the prote&s;tant princes in Germany. The queen promi&s;ed to &s;upply him with &s;uccours, on condition they &s;hould be u&s;ed to drive the Spaniards from the maritime pro|vinces of France oppo&s;ite to the coa&s;t of England. Though it was Henry's interest to expel them fir&s;t from the center of his dominions, he promi&s;ed to comply with her propo&s;al; and &s;he engaged by treaty to &s;upply him with three thou&s;and men, &s;tipulating, that within one year &s;he &s;hould be re|imbur&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> for the exp$nce of their levy, tran&s;portation, and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In pur&s;uance of this convention, &s;he &s;ent part of the&s;e &s;uccours into Britanny, un|der the command of Norreys, and the re&s;t into Picardy with Sir Roger Wil|liams. Henry at the &s;ame time negotiated for eleven thou&s;and men with the elector of Brandenburg and $a$ime$ prince Palatine; but all the&s;e auxiliaries being in&s;ufficient for his purpo&s;es, he demanded a &s;econd reinforcement from the queen of England, on pretence of inve&s;ting Rouen. She was &s;o anxious to &s;ee the Spaniards driven from the maritime places, that &s;he obliged her&s;elf by another treaty to &s;upply the French King with four thou&s;and men for this &s;ervice. She be&s;towed the command of the&s;e forces on the earl of E&s;&s;ex, who had &s;ucceeded Leice&s;ter as her maje&s;ty's chief favourite.

<P>Elizabeth was incen&s;ed to find her&s;elf thus duped by Henry, to whom &s;he wrote a letter, upbraiding him with breach of promi&s;e, and threat|ening to recall her troops from his dominions. Alarmed at the&s;e menaces, the French king ordered the mar$chal de Biron to inve&s;t Rouen; and this &s;tep furni&s;hed him with a pretext for demanding a further reinforcement from Eng|land, alledging that the la&s;t was con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by &s;ickne&s;s and de|&s;ertion.

<P>Henry now bent all his endeavours to be reconciled with the queen of England, who &s;ent him a new reinforcement of two thou&s;and men; and being extremely unea&s;y at the neighbourhood of the Spaniards, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Britanny; engaged in a new treaty, importing, That &s;he &s;hould &s;upply him with four thou&s;and men, &s;ome pieces of artillery, and a certain quantity of ammunition, on condition that the Engli&s;h forces &s;hould be joined by four thou&s;and French foot &s;oldiers, and one thou&s;and cavalry, to be de&s;tined for the recovery of Bretagne: That the French king &s;hould reim|bur&s;e her in one year: That he &s;hould not make peace with the Leaguers, until they &s;hould engage to join him in driving the Spaniards out of the kingdom: And that, in ca&s;e of peace with Spain, England &s;hould be comprehended in the treaty. Elizabeth performed her part of the contract with great punctua|lity, and &s;ent over her proportion of troops under the command of Norreys;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> but, in&s;tead of acting in Bretagne, they were obliged to &s;erve in Normandy, as Henry was hard pre&s;&s;ed in that province. The queen complained loudly of the contravention, and even threatened to recal her troops; but her own intere&s;t was &s;o much connected with the &s;afety of the French king, that &s;he would not put her threats in execution. She i&s;&s;ued out proclamations, prohibiting her &s;ubjects from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Leaguers, or the king of Spain, with corn, ammu|nition, or naval &s;tores. She equipped fifteen &s;hips of war, under the command of Sir Walter Raleigh, to di&s;tre&s;s the Spaniards in the We&s;t Indies; but his fleet being di&s;per&s;ed in a &s;torm, the expedition was countermanded. Then &s;he di&s;patched a &s;mall &s;quadron to cruize off the Azores, and Sir Martin Forbi&s;her to the coa&s;t of Spain, in order to lie in wait for the Spani&s;h carracks from the Ea&s;t Indies. Burroughs, who commanded the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;quadrons, drove one galleon on &s;hore, where it was burned, and took another, worth above one<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meteren.</NOTE> hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds. About the &s;ame time, Thomas White, a Londoner, made prize of two Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els loaded with quick&s;ilver and in|dulgences to be &s;old in the Mexican empire.</P>

&s;acrifice to a faction of his enemies, who accu&s;ed him of having reviled the queen, corre&s;ponded with her enemies, and fomented the rebellions in Ireland. He was convicted of trea&s;on upon partial evidence, and died in the Tower, after a long impri&s;onment. The Iri&s;h chieftains in Ul&s;ter engaged in a private<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ Ch. 1$$$.</NOTE> league for expelling the Engli&s;h garri&s;ons. The ca&s;tle of Montro&s;e was &s;ur|prized by O Donel; Macguire rai&s;ed an in&s;urrection in Fermanagh, and en|tering Connaught, was defeated by Sir Richard Bingham. Hugh earl of Tyrone engaged in this confederacy; and, upon the death of Tirloch Lei|r$ch, a&s;&s;umed the title of O Neale; but he afterwards &s;ubmitted, and was forgiven. The queen was more nearly touched by a con&s;piracy which had been lately di&s;covered in Scotland. The earls of Huntley, Errol, Angus, and &s;everal other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, &s;ollicited the king of Spain to make a de$$ent upon that kingdom. Their agent George Ker, brother to the l$$rd of New bottle, being &s;eized, with his di&s;patches, ju&s;t as he was going to embark, the mini&s;try became acquainted with the particulars of the &s;cheme. David Graham of Fintry, one of the accomplices, was condemned and be|headed; the re&s;t were &s;ummoned to appear before the parliament. Elizabeth, alarmed at this con&s;piracy, and &s;u&s;picious of the king's own inclinations, &s;ent the lord Burrough to congratulate him upon the di&s;covery of the plot; to a&s;&s;ure him of her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and pre&s;s him to puni&s;h the popi&s;h lords, by the confi&s;cation of their e&s;tates. She likewi&s;e de&s;ired a pardon for Bothwell, who having made two attempts to &s;eize the king's per&s;on, had been proclaimed a traitor, and fled into England. There he was protected by Elizabeth, who refu&s;ed to deliver him up when James demanded him, according to the &s;tipu|lations of the la&s;t treaty. He now excu&s;ed him&s;elf from pardoning &s;uch a notorious offender, but promi&s;ed to proceed judicially again&s;t the Roman ca|tholic noblemen. Ker e&s;caped from pri&s;on, and the parliament could not confi&s;cate the lords, for want of evidence. Sir Robert Melvil was di&s;patched to England, to demand of queen Elizabeth a &s;um of money which would enable the king to levy forces, and expel the rebels from the kingdom. James was &s;o wretchedly poor, that he could neither keep a table, nor maintain a guard for the defence of his own per&s;on. He therefore became an importunate beg|gar with the e&s;tates of the Netherlands, as well as with the queen of Eng|land, who, though &s;he &s;ometimes parted with trifling &s;ums, was too penurious to &s;upply him with a &s;ufficiency for his occa&s;ions. Melvil did not &s;ucceed in his negotiation; and Bothwell returning privately to Scotland, tampered &s;o effectually with the duke of Lennox, the earl of Athol, the lord Ochiltrec, and other enemies of chancellor Maitland, that they introduced him into the king's bed-chamber, where falling on his knees, and imploring his maje&s;ty's forgivene&s;s, he was $word$ at the reque&s;t of the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador. This pardon, however, $s the effect of compul&s;ion, was annulled by the conven|tion of the e&s;tates; though he was promi&s;ed to be indulged with an abolition of all his pa&s;t trea&s;ons, if he would &s;ue for it within a certain time, and then quit<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> the kingdom. Bothwell, di&s;&s;atisfied with the&s;e conditions, renewed his former practices again&s;t the king's per&s;on, but mi&s;carried in his attempts. A &s;ub&s;e|quent convention pa&s;&s;ed an act for the more firm e&s;tabli&s;hment of the prote&s;tant<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> religion in Scotland; and the catholic lords were &s;ummoned, either to comply with the doctrines of the kirk, within a limited time, or quit the country.</P>

<P>The Engli&s;h parliament meeting in the month of February, took cognizance of a book written by one Par&s;ons a Je&s;uit, endeavouring to prove that the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne of England was legally ve&s;ted in the Infanta of Spain. This performance was condemned by the parliament$ which declared, that all per&s;ons keeping it in their hou&s;es &s;hould be deemed guilty of high trea&s;on. The Puritans having grown intolerably in&s;olent and trouble&s;ome, were now laid under &s;evere re&s;trictions, by an act for retaining the queen's &s;ubjects in their due obedience. This law decreed that all per&s;ons above the age of &s;ixteen, ab&s;enting them&s;elves from church for a month, &s;hould be impri&s;oned, until relea&s;ed in con&s;equence of their public declaration of conformity. They were obliged to conform within three months after conviction, or abjure the realm; otherwi&s;e they were liable to be puni&s;hed as felons, without benefit of clergy. The &s;tatute, though enacted &s;eemingly again&s;t the Roman catholics, was principally levelled at the Puritans; and in|deed equally affected all non-conformi&s;ts. The commons granted a large &s;upply, in con&s;ideration of the great expence to which the queen had been expo&s;ed, for the defence of England again&s;t the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion, as well as for the &s;upport of the French king and the United Provinces, but this &s;ub&s;idy was granted with a clau&s;e, importing, that it &s;hould not be drawn into prece|dent: two &s;ub&s;idies were likewi&s;e voted by the clergy in convocation.</P>

<P>This genero&s;ity of the parliament and clergy con&s;oled Elizabeth in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the mortifications &s;he underwent from the conduct of Henry king of France. That prince, in&s;tead of u&s;ing the Engli&s;h auxiliaries for expelling the Spaniards from Britanny, employed them only as a check upon tho&s;e invaders, while he exerted his chief endeavours in other parts of his kingdom; &s;o that Elizabeth would have recalled her troops, had not &s;he been diverted from her purpo&s;e by the intreaties and remon&s;trances of the ma|rechal d'Aumont, who a&s;&s;ured her, in her ma&s;ter's name, that a powerful effort would &s;oon be made for the reduction of Bretagne. At this period Henry finding it impo&s;&s;ible to reduce the kingdom of France to his obedience, while he profe&s;&s;ed the prote&s;tant religion, and being hard pre&s;&s;ed by his Roman ca|tholic friends, renounced the reformed doctrines, and declared him&s;elf a con|vert to the church of Rome. The queen of England was no &s;ooner informed of this event, than &s;he wrote a &s;evere letter, upbraiding him with his apo&s;tacy; which he frankly imputed to the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs. But, notwith&s;tanding Elizabeth's re&s;entment, &s;he con&s;ented to engage in a new league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with Henry, when &s;he under&s;tood that the king of Spain intended to make a powerful effort to &s;upport the League; and this alliance was actually concluded at Melun, in the month of October, &s;tipulating, that no peace &s;hould be made with Spain, without the mutual con&s;ent of both parties. Elizabeth then recommended the prote&s;tants to the protection of Henry, and propo&s;ed Bre&s;t as a place of retreat for the Engli&s;h forces, and cautionary town for the repayment of the money with which &s;he had &s;upplied him in his nece&s;&s;ities; but this &s;ecurity he carefully evaded. The queen, to &s;ecure her&s;elf &s;till more effectually from the in&s;ults of the Spaniards, ordered the i&s;les of Scilly$ to be fortified and garri&s;oned; while Jer&s;ey and Guern&s;ey were &s;ecured in the &s;ame manner. The Engli&s;h fugitives &s;till continued to plot again&s;t Elizabeth and her government. One $word$, at their in&s;tigation, exhorted Ferdinard earl of
<PB N="110" REF="1120">
Derby to a&s;&s;ume the title of king, as grand&s;on of Mary, daughter to Henry VII. He a&s;&s;ured the earl he &s;hould be powerfully &s;upported by Philip of Spain; and threatened, in ca&s;e of his declining the propo&s;al and revealing the &s;cheme, that he &s;hould not long enjoy his life. The earl immediately informed again&s;t $word$ who was condemned accordingly: but his threats were certainly exe|cuted<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$$den.</NOTE> upon the earl, who in a few months died of poi&s;on.</P>

<P>The death of the duke of Parma did not wholly put a &s;top to the intended inva&s;ion of France. The Spani&s;h army entering Picardy, reduced Noyons, and then marched back to the Low-Countries. The count de Fu|entes, and Don Diego d'Ibarra, who were now at the head of the Spani&s;h affairs in the Netherlands, not only fomented the troubles in Scotland, by feeding the mad$$ontents of that kingdom with promi&s;es of &s;uccour; but they re&s;olved to take off Elizabeth by poi&s;on. For this purpo&s;e they corrupted Roderic Lopez, a Por$ug$$se Jew, who was one of her phy&s;icians, with a bribe of fifty thou&s;and crowns. The de&s;ign being di&s;covered by intercepted letters, he and two of his accomplices were apprehended, and confe&s;&s;ed the nature of their corre&s;pondence with Fuentes and Ibarra. At the place of execution, Lopez declared that he loved the queen as well as he loved Je&s;us Chri&s;t; an expre&s;&s;ion which coming from the mouth of a Jew, excited the mirth of the &s;pectators. At the &s;ame time, Patrick Cull$n, an Iri&s;h fencing-ma&s;ter, was convicted of having been &s;ent from the Low Countries to $word$ the queen; Edmund York and Richard Williams were likewi&s;e apprehended, as ru&s;&s;ians &s;uborned by Ibarra for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Elizabeth wrote a letter to Erne&s;t archduke of Au&s;tria, by this time appointed governor of the Low-Countries, de&s;iring he would puni&s;h the authors of &s;uch treachery; and demanding that the Engli&s;h fugitives con|cerned in &s;uch de&s;igns, &s;hould be delivered into her hands. But &s;he had very little rea&s;on to expect any &s;atisfaction on this head, as &s;he her&s;elf protected An|tonio Perez, late &s;ecretary to Philip, who had excited &s;ome commotions in Arragon, and fled to England, where he was entertained and care$&s;ed by the earl of Effex.</P>

This amba&s;&s;ador repre&s;ented, in the queen's name, that the Roman catholics of Scotland enjoyed in public the exerci&s;e of their religion, and openly corre&s;ponded with the king of Spain. James replied, that he would act again&s;t them ac|cording to the laws of the land; and, if they &s;hould refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to the laws, he would pur&s;ue them by force of arms, provided the queen, who was as much intere&s;ted as him&s;elf, in the &s;ucce&s;s of the war, would contribute to the expence. Lord Zouch &s;till pre&s;&s;ing him to enact &s;everer laws again&s;t them, the king an&s;wered, with &s;ome emotion, that the queen of England had no right to command him, or to pre&s;cribe the rules by which he &s;hould govern his own kingdom. Then he demanded that &s;he would deliver up Bothw$ll, who had again taken refuge in England. Far from giving him that &s;atisfaction, $he in all probability furni&s;hed Bothwell with means to return and rai&s;e four hundred men, with whom he &s;urprized Leith.

The citizens of Edinburgh taking arms again&s;t him, he retined towards Dalkeith, and routed the lord Hume, who commanded the advanced guard of a body of forces headed by the king in per&s;on$ but, not daring to &s;tand the brunt of a general engagement, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his troops, and took refuge once more in England$ James immediately di&s;patched two envoys to complain to Elizabeth of Bothwell's being &s;till harboured in her dominions; to a&s;&s;ure her he would pro&s;eribe the per&s;ons, and confi&s;cate the lands of the popi&s;h lords; and to de&s;ire a &s;upply of money in the mean time. She promi&s;ed to comply with his reque&s;t, and forthwith publi&s;hed a proclama|tion, forbidding her &s;ubjects to give &s;helter to the earl of Bothwell. The Scotti&s;h parliament meeting in May, pronounced &s;entence of forfeiture again&s;t the three popi$h earls, and the laird of Auchi$down: but the execution of the &s;entence was deferred, on account of the bapti&s;m of Henry prince of Scotland. Elizabeth &s;ent the earl of Su&s;&s;ex as amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to attend at this &s;olemnity, at which al&s;o were pre&s;ent the envoys of Denmark, Brun&s;wick, Mecklenburg, and the United Provinces.</P>

<P>Incen&s;ed as Elizabeth was again&s;t the Spaniard, for his uncea$ing endeavours to di&s;tre&s;s her and her allies, &s;he would not expend her &s;ub&s;idies in the operations of an offen&s;ive war, but annoyed the enemy by granting commi&s;&s;ions to private adventurers, who acted again&s;t them at their own expence.

<P>Philip of Spain retorted the&s;e ho&s;tilities by exciting a fre&s;h re|bellion in Ireland, under the conduct of Macguire and Mac-Mahon. Sir W. Ru$$el had been &s;ent over to &s;ucceed Fitzwilliams as lord deputy; and the earl of Tyrone having been accu&s;ed of corre&s;ponding with the rebels, pleaded his own cau&s;e &s;o effectually, in a vi&s;it to the new governor, that he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed as a loyal &s;ubject. Notwith&s;tanding his profe&s;&s;ions, he attacked the fort of Black-water, in the ab&s;ence of the governor; and being declared a traitor, openly joined the rebels, who&s;e forces in Ul&s;ter and Connaught amounted to near ten thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot, commanded by experienced officers, who had &s;erved in the Low Countries. Elizabeth, alarmed at this formid$ble rebellion, recalled Sir John Norreys, with a body of veterans, from Britanny; and the&s;e being joined with a reinforcement in England, were &s;ent over to Ireland
<PB N="113" REF="1150">
to cru&s;h the rebels before they &s;hould receive the &s;uccours they expected from Spain. When Norreys advanced to Armagh, Tyrone abandoned the fort of Black-water, reduced the town of Dungannon and the neighbouring villages to a&s;hes, and was driven almo&s;t to de&s;pair, when the want of provi&s;ions com|pelled the Engli&s;h general to retire, after he had left garri&s;ons in Armagh and Monaghan. Neverthele&s;s, Feagh Mac-Hugh, chief of the Byrnes, &s;ub|mitted to the lord deputy; and Norreys agreed with Tyrone and O Donel for a truce till the end of December. This introduced a treaty or negotiation with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1596.</NOTE> the rebels, who demanded a general amne&s;ty, the free exerci&s;e of their reli|gion, the re&s;titution of their e&s;tates, and an exemption from all garri&s;ons and impo&s;itions. The queen offered to pardon them for their rebellion, provided they would di&s;mi&s;s their forces, repair the forts they had demoli&s;hed, re&s;tore the effects they had &s;eized, admit garri&s;ons, &s;heriffs, and other officers, and di&s;cover their tran&s;actions with foreign princes. They rejected the&s;e propo&s;als, though the truce was prolonged to April. The queen would have repaired their lo&s;&s;es, but would by no means indulge them with a toleration. Tyrone in the mean time treated with Philip as well as with Elizabeth, and cunningly tran&s;mitted to the lord deputy the letters which he received from that monarch. The&s;e he pre&s;ented as proofs of his loyalty to Elizabeth; though his aim was to deceive the vigilance of the deputy, and inhance the opinion of his own importance. Before the truce expired he capitulated with Norreys, and delivered ho&s;tages, in con&s;equence of a pardon for him&s;elf and his accomplices: yet he refu&s;ed to take the oath of allegiance. The rebels in Connaught &s;ubmitted on the &s;ame terms: but this peace was of &s;hort duration. O Donel ravaged the country: Feagh Mac-Hugh, at the in&s;tigation of Tyrone, renewed the rebellion in Lein&s;ter, and &s;urprized the fort at Balencore; but he was &s;oon routed and &s;lain, together with George and Peter Butler, nephews to the earl of Ormond, whom Feagh had per|&s;uaded to join in the revolt. Tyrone attacked the garri&s;on of Armagh; but afterwards made an apology for this act of violence, and propo&s;ed a new con|ference with the lord deputy, for a full and final compo&s;ition. His aim being only to amu&s;e him, this conference was po&s;tponed from time to time, and at la&s;t the de&s;ign was wholly laid a&s;ide. The progre&s;s of the rebels was in a good mea&s;ure owing to a jealou&s;y that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Ru&s;&s;el and Norreys; and Tyrone did not fail to take the advantage of their mi&s;under&s;tanding. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE></P>

The French king was extremely chagrined at the repul&s;e he had &s;u&s;tained from Elizabeth; and many members of his council advi&s;ed him to make a &s;eparate peace. He complained &s;till more loudly of the United Provinces, which, though in alliance with him, had taken no &s;tep for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> relief of &s;uch a con&s;iderable place.

Though they had actually grown rich during the war, they pleaded inability, exag|gerating their lo&s;&s;es at &s;ea, the inunnation of their country, and the great ex|pence which they had undergone in equipping fleets to join her navy again&s;t the Spaniards. She would not admit of their excu&s;es, alledging, that if they had money to give away to the king of France, they &s;urely could not be in|capable of paying their ju&s;t debts. She upbraided them with their ingratitude; and reminded them of the deplorable &s;ituation in which they were when &s;he generou&s;ly took them into her protection. They might have ju&s;tly told her, that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they had received was more owing to a &s;en&s;e of her own in|tere&s;t, than to motives of genero&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion; and they might have pleaded the condition of the loan, by which &s;he was not entitled to reimbur&s;e|ment until the war &s;hould be fini&s;hed: but they deprecated her wrath by &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, and obtained a re&s;pite, by furni&s;hing her with four and twenty &s;hips well manned, and provided for five months, to join her navy in an attempt again&s;t the Spaniards. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the cardinal Albert of Au&s;tria &s;ucceeding his brother Erne&s;t in the government of the Low Countries, threw a reinforcement into La F$re, which Henry IV. be&s;ieged in per&s;on, and then inve&s;ted Calais. The French king immediately di&s;patched Sancy to England for &s;uccour: he was followed by the marechal de Bouillon, who importuned Elizabeth &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly, that &s;he ordered eight thou&s;and men to be levied and &s;ent over, under the command of E&s;&s;ex; but, before they could embark, the place &s;urrendered, and the troops were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, though &s;he &s;upplied Henry with a &s;um of money on the credit of his two amba&s;&s;adors.</P>

<P>The queen being apprized of Philip's great preparations again&s;t England or Ireland, equipped a fleet of one hundred and fifty &s;hips, including tho&s;e that were &s;ent by the &s;tates general. Robert earl of E&s;&s;ex, and Charles Howard lord admiral of England, who had expended va&s;t &s;ums on this oc|ca&s;ion, were appointed chiefs of the armament, though with different com|mands; the admiral directed the operation at &s;ea, and the earl conducted the forces at their landing. The fleet was divided into four &s;quadrons, of which the third was commanded by the lord Thomas Howard, and the fourth by

Sir Walter Raleigh. Having received their in&s;tructions, they &s;et &s;ail from Plymouth in the beginning of June; and, on the twentieth day of that month anchored near St. Seba&s;tian's chapel, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land of Cadiz. The Spani&s;h &s;hips of war retiring into the Puntal, were next day attacked by the Engli&s;h; and the engagement la&s;ted from break of day till noon, when the enemy &s;eeing their galleons mi&s;erably &s;hattered, and a great number of their men killed, re&s;olved to &s;et fire to their ve&s;&s;els, and run them a&s;hore. The Spani&s;h admiral called the St. Philip was burned, together with two or three other &s;hips that lay near her; but the St. Matthew and St. Andrew were &s;aved and taken. Immediately after this action, the earl of E&s;&s;ex landed at Puntal with eight hundred men, and advanced again&s;t a body of five hundred Spaniards, who retreated into Cadiz at his approach. The&s;e were &s;o clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, and the inhabitants were in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that no &s;teps could be taken for the de|fence of the place, until the Engli&s;h had bur&s;t open the gate and entered the city. After a &s;hort skirmi&s;h in the &s;treets, the a&s;&s;ailants made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the market-place, and the garri&s;on retired into the ca&s;tle; though they &s;oon capitulated, on condition that the inhabitants &s;hould have liberty to depart with their wearing apparel, and all their other effects be di&s;tributed as booty among the &s;oldiers; that they &s;hould pay five hundred and twenty thou|&s;and ducats for the ran&s;om of their lives, and &s;end forty of their chief citizens to England, as ho&s;tages for the payment of the money. The earl of E&s;&s;ex being now entirely ma&s;ter of the place, turned out all the inhabitants, and loaded the &s;hips with the money and rich effects which the &s;oldiers had not yet taken in plunder. Mean while admiral Howard detached Sir Walter Raleigh to burn the merchant-&s;hips which had retired to Port-Real. Two millions of ducats were offered as their ran&s;om; but he rejected the propo&s;al, ob&s;erving that he was come to burn, and not to ran&s;om their &s;hips. The duke of Me|dina Sidonia, however, found means to unload &s;ome, and &s;et fire to others, that they might not fall into the hands of the Engli&s;h. Be&s;ides the lo&s;s which their merchants &s;u&s;tained in this expedition, the king lo&s;t two galleons, thir|teen &s;hips of war, and four and twenty ve&s;&s;els laden with merchandize for the Indies, over and above the ammunition which he had provided for his de&s;ign upon England. The earl of E&s;&s;ex was of opinion, that Cadiz ought to be kept as a thorn in the &s;ide of the Spaniards, and offered to remain in per&s;on for its defence: but the majority being impatient to return to their own country with the booty they had obtained, his motion was over-ruled, and they &s;et &s;ail for England, after having &s;et fire to the town and adjacent villages. When they arrived at Faro, in Algarbe, they found the place de|&s;erted, and all the effects removed. The fleet being afterwards driven out to &s;ea by a &s;trong northern gale, E&s;&s;ex propo&s;ed to make an attempt upon the Azores; but nobody &s;econding the propo&s;al, except the lord Howard, they returned to England, enriched with the &s;poils of the enemy. E&s;&s;ex, however, had the mortification to find that Sir Robert Cecil, &s;on of the lord trea&s;urer, had in his ab&s;ence been appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate; an office to which the earl had &s;trongly recommended Sir Thomas Bodley, who had been &s;ent as amba&s;&s;ador to the Low-Countries. His chagrin was &s;till augmented by the queen's appointing Sir Francis Vere governor of the Brille; a place of tru&s;t which E&s;&s;ex &s;ollicited for him&s;elf. <NOTE PLACE="marg">C$m$$$</NOTE></P>

<P>Elizabeth, though &s;he had a particular attachment to the per&s;on of E&s;&s;ex, payed very little regard to his recommendations, partly becau&s;e &s;he looked upon him as an impetuous youth, without experience and di&s;cernment; and partly becau&s;e he was privately oppo&s;ed by old Cecil, who had long &s;erved her with the utmo&s;t fidelity, was clo&s;e, careful, penurious; and, in a word, a mini&s;ter after her own heart. It was by his &s;ugge&s;tions that the queen became &s;o importunate with the &s;tates of the Netherlands for the pay|ment of the debt they had contracted. They were &s;ufficiently able to di&s;|charge this obligation; but they con&s;idered the debt as a tie which connected Elizabeth more firmly to their intere&s;t; and therefore were extremely aver&s;e to part with this bond of union. When &s;he renewed her demands, they &s;ent de|puties to London, to make fre&s;h remon&s;trances; they offered to pay two hundred thou&s;and florins yearly, either for her life, or during the war, and four millions in as many years after the peace &s;hould be concluded.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the di&s;gu&s;t which Elizabeth had conceived again&s;t the French king; and that prince's re&s;entment of her refu&s;ing to &s;uccour Calais, their mutual intere&s;t was &s;o in&s;eparably connected in the war with Spain, that they agreed to open conferences for a treaty, which had been propo&s;ed before the Spaniards had reduced the towns in Picardy. The duke of Bouillon was &s;ent over to a&s;&s;i&s;t Sancy in the negotiation; and Eng|li&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners being appointed to treat with them, the league was &s;oon concluded, on condition that Elizabeth &s;hould furni&s;h four thou&s;and men for the defence of Picardy and Normandy: That the king of France &s;hould &s;upply her with the like number, in ca&s;e her kingdom &s;hould be invaded;<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> and that neither party &s;hould make peace without the other's con&s;ent. The &s;tates-general acceded to this treaty; though their admi&s;&s;ion was retarded by the jealou&s;y of Elizabeth, who pretended that they had no right to accede as a &s;overeign power, but merely as a&s;&s;ociated towns under her protection.

<P>Philip of Spain, exa&s;perated by the conduct of Elizabeth, and the lo&s;&s;es he had &s;u&s;tained from the arms of her people, re&s;olved to make another effort for the conque&s;t of England. He a&s;&s;embled a formidable fleet at a time when the queen thought him utterly di&s;abled from executing any &s;cheme of revenge; and this navy having taken land forces on board at Fariola, &s;teered its cour&s;e for England; but was di&s;per&s;ed by a violent &s;torm, which rendered it altogether un&s;erviceable for that &s;ea&s;on. The king of Spain had begun to treat privately of a &s;eparate peace with Henry; but the negotiation was altogether interrupted by the &s;ucce&s;s of Porto Carrero, governor of Dour|lens, who found means to &s;urpri&s;e Amiens; though this advantage did not recompence Philip for the defeat of his troops at Turnhaut by prince Maurice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Almo&s;t all the native Iri&s;h in Ul&s;ter and Connaught being encouraged by his emi&s;&s;aries with hope of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, had ri&s;en in arms; and Thomas lord Burrough was &s;ent over by Elizabeth with the commi&s;&s;ion of lord deputy.

<P>Elizabeth now re&s;olved to make an attempt upon Tercera, the prin|cipal i&s;land of the Azores, and, if po&s;&s;ible, intercept the Spani&s;h flota in their pa&s;&s;age from the We&s;t Indies. Five thou&s;and &s;oldiers were embarked in a fleet of one hundred and twenty &s;hips; and to the&s;e were added five and twenty Dutch &s;hips, under the command of admiral Warmout, having on board one thou&s;and Engli&s;h veterans from the Low-Countries, headed by Sir Francs Vere, governor of the Brille. The chief command of this armament was conferred upon the earl of E&s;&s;ex. The lord Mountjoy was his lieutenant for the land forces; and his &s;econd and third &s;quadrons were conducted by lord Thomas Howard and Sir Walter Raleigh. He was in&s;tructed to de&s;troy the Spani&s;h fleet at Ferrol, and then proceed to the Azores. He &s;ailed from Plymouth on the tenth day of June, but the fleet was &s;cattered by a violent tempe&s;t, and the &s;hips were obliged to put in at different ports of England; though, in a few days, they rendezvou&s;ed at Plymouth. They &s;ailed again in Augu&s;t, and were damaged in &s;uch a manner, by another &s;torm, that they laid a&s;ide their de&s;ign upon Ferrol, which was by this time &s;trongly fortified, and proceeded directly to the Azores. Raleigh being parted from the other admirals, ar|rived at Flores, and &s;ailing to Fayal, in que&s;t of the earl of E&s;&s;ex, took that town before he joined the general, who re&s;ented his acting without orders; but was pacified by Raleigh's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The earl propo&s;ed to wait at the i&s;land of Gracio&s;a for the Indian fleet; but was per&s;uaded by a pilot to &s;ail for the i&s;le of St. Michael, where he would find a &s;afer harbour. He had not &s;ailed two hours from Gracio&s;a, when the plate fleet arrived at that i&s;land; and being informed of the Engli&s;h armament, &s;teered directly for Tercera, where they anchored under the town of Angra, and ca&s;tle of Brazil. They pa&s;&s;ed in the night through a &s;mall &s;quadron of four &s;hips, commanded by Sir W. Mon&s;on, who di&s;patched a ve&s;&s;el with intelligence to the earl of E&s;&s;ex: but they were po&s;ted in &s;uch a manner, when that nobleman came to ob&s;erve them, that it was judged impracticable to attack them, without the utmo&s;t danger; and all their trea&s;ure was by this time &s;ent on &s;hore. He had, however, taken<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camde$.</NOTE> three ve&s;&s;els which had &s;traggled from the flota. He now &s;ailed back to St. Michael, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Villa Franca, where he found a con|&s;iderable booty, and &s;tore of refre&s;hment for his people. Raleigh, mean while, drove a&s;hore and de&s;troyed an Indian carrack. Then the earl &s;et &s;ail for England, and arrived at Plymouth in the latter end of October. The lord trea&s;urer had re&s;igned the place of ma&s;ter of the court of wards, in fa|vour of his &s;on Sir Robert; and E&s;&s;ex complained that old Cecil had taken the advantage of his ab&s;ence. The earl was likewi&s;e mortified to &s;ee the ad|miral created ea$l of Nottingham, &s;o as to precede him in rank; but he re|ceived &s;ome &s;atisfaction in being promoted to the honour of earl marechal of England.</P>

<P>We have already ob&s;erved, that the Han$e towns had compl$in$d that the Engli&s;h fleet had &s;eized their &s;hips at Li$bon. As they were not &s;a$$s$ied with Elizabeth's an&s;wer, they appealed to the diet of the empire, and obtained a decree, prohibiting the Engli&s;h to trade in the dominions of Germany. The Engli&s;h merchants were driven from Hamburg, and other Han&s;e towns; and Sigi&s;mund king of Poland &s;ent over an amba&s;&s;ador to England, to de|mand the &s;hips belonging to his &s;ubjects, which had been taken in Portugal. This envoy, in a Latin oration, &s;poke in very high terms, and even threatened the queen with his ma&s;ter's re&s;entment. Elizabeth an&s;wered him extempore, in the &s;ame language, telling him his ma&s;ter was a raw, hot|headed, young prince, who did not know the nature of &s;uch negotiations; and that he him&s;elf was a pedant, ignorant of mankind, and unacquainted with the rules of decorum. She ju&s;tified her conduct by the law of nations; &s;aid the king of Poland was impertinent to mention and boa&s;t of his alliance with the hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Spain; ob&s;erving that &s;he was very little obliged to the fir&s;t, and had &s;et the other at defiance. The di&s;pute between England and the Hanie towns became &s;o &s;erious, that Elizabeth i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, inhibiting them from trading to her dominions, and ordering the lord mayor to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of the &s;teel-yard. The towns on the other hand re&s;olved to form an a&s;&s;ociation to prevent the Engli&s;h from trading to Germany and Poland; but this confederacy was prevented by Sir George Carew, who being empower|ed to offer an enjoyment of their antient privileges, as an indulgence from the crown of England, and a free traffic to Spain with corn, and all other com|modities, except naval &s;tores, the magi&s;trates of Dantzick refu&s;ed to &s;end de|puties<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rymer.

<P>It was the fate of Elizabeth to be continually wrangling with her allies, becau&s;e they were in continual want of her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which &s;he &s;eldom granted, except upon such terms as they could not ea&s;ily ob&s;erve. Henry IV. being greatly incommoded by the Spaniards, &s;ince they had made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Amiens, re&s;olved to retake that city, and &s;ummoned the queen of England to &s;end over the four thou&s;and men &s;tipulated in the la$t treaty. She con&s;ented to his reque&s;t, on condition that he would pay them while they &s;hould be in his &s;ervice; but, this being a condition which he could not ea&s;ily fulfil, be endeavoured to extort her compliance by alarming her jealou&s;y. He gave her to under&s;tand, that he had it in his option to make a &s;eparate peace with Phi|lip, who had offered to re&s;tore all the towns he had taken but Calais and Ar|dres, provided he would detach him&s;elf from the intere&s;t of England. This ex|pedient an&s;wered his purpo&s;e. Elizabeth de&s;ired her amba&s;&s;ador to tell him, that &s;he could not per&s;uade her&s;elf he would violate the treaty, to the ob&s;ervation of which he had &s;o &s;olemnly &s;worn: and that he might be encouraged to fulfil his engagements, &s;he &s;ent over her troops, with a round &s;um of money. By virtue of this &s;upply, he was enabled to carry on the &s;iege of Amiens, which &s;urren|dered to him in September. Then the private negotiations between him and Spain were renewed; and the principal articles were &s;ettled before he dropped the lea&s;t hint of peace to his allies. The queen, however, di&s;covered the&s;e prac|tices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D$$$e.</NOTE> at which &s;he was not a little alarmed.

<P>Sir Robert Cecil was di&s;patched to France to know upon what foot|ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He promi&s;ed, however, that he would employ all his influence in obtaining ho|nourable and advantageous terms to the queen of England and the &s;tates ge|neral. As he expected nothing but reproaches from his allies, he re&s;olved to &s;pare him&s;elf the mortification of bearing them in his own per&s;on, and therefore ap|pointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the Engli&s;h and Dutch amba&s;&s;adors. At this conference, Barnevelt, one of the Netherland envoys, &s;ummoned Henry, though ab&s;ent, to an&s;wer on his con&s;cience, whether or not he thought it was beneath the honour of a prince to abandon his allies in &s;uch a manner. Cecil &s;poke with great freedom on the &s;ame &s;ubject; and demanded that the peace might be deferred until he could receive new in&s;tructions from his mi&s;tre&s;s. The two amba&s;&s;adors even offered, in the name of their con&s;tituents, to furni&s;h him with ten thou&s;and infantry, and one thou&s;and hor&s;e, to be maintained by En|gland and the Netherlands through the whole cour&s;e of the war, provided Henry would renounce his treaty with Philip, and engage with them in a per|petual alliance. The chancellor of France expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t gratitude for the &s;uccours the king had already received; and excu&s;ed his ma&s;ter's conduct from the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs. In vain did Elizabeth upbraid him in a &s;evere let|ter with his ingratitude and perfidy: he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign, to give peace to his country. The negotiations were carried on at Vervins; and on the twelfth day of June, the peace was ratified by Henry; after he had de|layed it for a few weeks, in order to &s;ave appearances.

<P>Elizabeth immediately &s;ent Sir Thomas Vere to know the re&s;olution of the &s;tates general. She was already determined to maintain the war, by which alone &s;he thought Philip would be &s;o much employed in the Netherlands, that he would not find it practicable to execute his &s;chemes again&s;t England. But, &s;he affected a &s;trong propen&s;ity to peace, alledging that &s;he could no longer bear &s;uch a heavy burthen. The &s;tates, who&s;e &s;afety in a great mea&s;ure de|pended upon her friend&s;hip and alliance, were &s;o alarmed at her declaration, that they agreed to &s;uch terms of a new league as &s;he thought proper to propo&s;e. The treaty was accordingly concluded, on condition, That the &s;tates &s;hould give &s;ecurity for the payment of eight millions of florins, to which &s;he limited her demands: That one half of this &s;um &s;hould be liquidated during the war, by certain annual payments; and that the re&s;titution of the places which were in the hands of the Engli&s;h, together with the payment of the other half, &s;hould be amicably &s;ettled after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the peace: That the queen &s;hould furni&s;h eleven hundred and fifty men to garri&s;on different fortre&s;&s;es, and be paid by the &s;tates: That, for the future, the queen &s;hould &s;tand di&s;|charged of the engagement to furni&s;h any other auxiliary troops; but, that the Engli&s;h who either were at that time, or might be in the &s;ervice of the

&s;tates, &s;hould take the oath to the &s;aid &s;tates, be maintained by them, and obey<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> their generals: That the power of the deputy of England, &s;tipulated in the for|mer treaty, &s;hould be aboli&s;hed; though the queen re&s;erved to her&s;elf the li|berty of &s;ending one per&s;on to &s;it in their council: That when &s;he &s;hould be en|gaged in war again&s;t the common enemy, whether offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive, the &s;tates &s;hould furni&s;h her with forty or fifty &s;hips of war, five thou&s;and foot &s;ol|diers, and five hundred cavalry. About this time the earl of Cumberland re|turned from the We&s;t Indies, where he had taken Poto rico, and &s;ent away the inhabitants, that he might convert it into an Engli&s;h &s;ettlement; but, having lo&s;t a great number of men by the dy&s;entery, he re-embarked his people for England, having reaped very little fruit from his expedition, in which he had plendered Lancerata, one of the Canary i&s;lands.</P>

<P>In the la&s;t voyage of Sir Francis Drake, one Squire had been taken by the Spaniards, and per&s;uaded by Walpole, an Engli&s;h je&s;uit, to attempt the lives of the queen and the earl of E&s;&s;ex. He furni&s;hed him with a poi&s;onous powder, to be &s;prinkled upon the earl's chair and the queen's &s;addle; and Squire, at his return to England, tried the experiment, without effect. Wal|pole &s;uppo&s;ing that Squire had deceived him, as Elizabeth and E&s;&s;ex &s;till con|tinued in good health, &s;ent over a per&s;on in revenge to accu&s;e Squire, who be|ing apprehended, confe&s;&s;ed the whole affair, and was executed as a traitor. Elizabeth never thought her&s;elf &s;afe from &s;uch attempts during the life of Phi|lip II. king of Spain, who now died in the &s;ixty &s;econd year of his age, after having reigned two and forty, during which he had embroiled all Europe by his ambition, and lo&s;t the &s;even United Provinces by his cruelty, bigotry, and ar|bitrary admini&s;tration. The fire of rebellion which he kindled in Ireland con|tinued to burn violently, even after his decea&s;e. The earl of Tyrone had again rebelled, defeated and &s;lain Sir Henry Bagnal, and reduced the fort of Black|water. Though his progre&s;s was checked by the arrival of Sir Samuel Bagnal, with a reinforcement from England, all Connaught revolted; and a rebellion was rai&s;ed in Mun&s;ter, by Owny Macroryage and Sir Thomas of De&s;mond. They drove the Engli&s;h &s;ettlers from their hou&s;es and plantations, and inve&s;ted Kilmallock; but, the earl of Ormond advancing with a body of forces, com|pelled them to rai&s;e the &s;iege, put Cork, Kin&s;ale and Youghal in a po&s;ture of defence, exacted ho&s;tages from the chieftains: then marching into Lein&s;ter, he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> routed a body of the rebels, and relieved the ca&s;tle of Maryborough.</P>

<P>Elizabeth con&s;ulting with the earl of E&s;&s;ex and the admiral about the choice of a proper per&s;on for the admini&s;tration of Ireland, E&s;&s;ex recom|mended Mr. George Carew, in oppo&s;ition to Sir George Knolles, whom, how|ever, the queen preferred to his competitor. The earl was &s;o provoked at her &s;lighting his recommendation, that he turned his back upon her in contempt; and &s;he, incen&s;ed at his in&s;olence, gave him a box on the ear, bidding him go and be hanged. E&s;&s;ex laying his hand upon his &s;word, &s;wore he would not have taken &s;uch an affront from Henry VIII. and retired from court in a tran|&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion. Notwith&s;tanding all the remon&s;trances of his friends, he for &s;ome time breathed nothing but revenge and defiance; but at length his pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;iding, he was pardoned, and received again into favour.

He was one of tho&s;e cold, plodding, illiberal &s;tate&s;men, who think hone&s;ty and plain pealing are incompatible with the art of government.

He was an excellent mini&s;ter for the revenue, which he managed with equal frugality and addre&s;s. In his private behaviour he was clo&s;e, covetous, ill-bred, and un|gracious.

<P>The rebellion continuing &s;till to rage in Ireland, the queen and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He was accordingly appointed lord deputy of Ireland, with a more exten&s;ive commi&s;|&s;ion than ever had been granted to any of his predece&s;&s;ors; and &s;etting out im|mediately for his government, arrived in Dublin the &s;eventeenth day of April. In&s;tead of advancing directly again&s;t Tyrone, according to the in&s;tructions he had received, he marched into Mun&s;ter, where, having reduced the ca&s;tle of Cahir, received the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the inhabitants, and performed &s;ome incon&s;i|derable exploits again&s;t a body of the rebels. He returned to Dublin in the lat|ter end of June, after having lo&s;t a great number of his men by &s;ickne&s;s and fatigue. The queen being informed of his tran&s;actions, wrote a &s;evere letter, reproaching him with his contempt of her orders. He excu&s;ed him&s;elf by &s;aying he had followed the advice of the council of Ireland, and promi&s;ed to march into Ul&s;ter again&s;t Tyrone; neverthele&s;s, he turned his arms again&s;t the O Mores and O Conners in Leix and Offaly; and by that time he returned from this petty expedition, his forces were &s;o much dimini&s;hed, that he demanded a reinforce|ment of one thou&s;and men from England. In the mean time he ordered Clif|ford, governor of Connaught, to make a diver&s;ion on the &s;ide of Belick, where he was routed and &s;lain by O Rourke. E&s;&s;ex, having received a &s;upply of troops from England, marched again&s;t Tyrone to the borders of Ul&s;ter, and obliged him to retire into woods and fa&s;tne&s;&s;es. Then that rebel craved a parley, which he obtained at Louth, where both parties agreed to a ce&s;&s;ation for &s;ix weeks, to be renewed occa&s;ionally for the &s;ame term, or vacated on a fortnight's notice from either &s;ide. Having concluded this inglorious truce, he marched back to Dublin, where he under&s;tood the queen was greatly incen&s;ed again&s;t him, for having pre&s;umed to di&s;obey her orders a &s;econd time. He therefore re|&s;olved to return to England, even without leave, to counter-work the efforts of his enemies at court; and his departure is &s;aid to have been ha&s;tened, by fal&s;e re|ports of the queen's being dangerou&s;ly ill, and de&s;paired of by her phy&s;icians. The&s;e rumours were indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated by his adver&s;aries, who, at the &s;ame time, &s;topped all &s;hips but tho&s;e that carried this intelligence. The friends of E&s;&s;ex advi&s;ed him to land in Wales with the Iri&s;h army, which was at his devotion; but, he rejected this council, and leaving the admini&s;tration of Ire|land in the hands of the lord chancellor Loftus and Sir George Carew, &s;et &s;ail for England with a very &s;mall retinue.</P>

<P>Elizabeth had received &s;uch bad impre&s;&s;ions of him from his en e|mies, that &s;he now began to &s;u&s;pect him of de&s;igns upon the crown, and made preparations for her own &s;afety. On pretence of having received intelligence that the Spaniards were employed in equipping a powerful fleet again&s;t England, &s;he granted commi&s;&s;ions for levying &s;ix thou&s;and men, and be&s;towed the com|mand of them upon the lord admiral, who was no friend to E&s;&s;ex. She ordered the trained bands of London to be armed and exerci&s;ed. Chains were drawn acro&s;s the principal &s;treets of London, and the gates were &s;trongly guarded, as in times of the mo&s;t imminent danger: but, when &s;he under&s;tood by letters from Ireland, that the earl of E&s;&s;ex had no intention to bring over the forces, &s;he di&s;banded the new levies, and the citizens were relea&s;ed from &s;uch &s;everity of watch and di&s;cipline. E&s;&s;ex mean while landing in England, with the earl of Southampton, and &s;ome other officers, po&s;ted immediately to the court, which was then at Non&s;uch, about ten miles from London; and, without &s;hift|ing his dre&s;s, or clean&s;ing him&s;elf from the &s;oil of his journey, went directly to the queen's bed-chamber, where he found her maje&s;ty ju&s;t ri&s;en, with her hair<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> hanging over her eyes. He kneeled and ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and after &s;ome pri|vate conver&s;ation, returned to his own apartment, flu&s;hed with joy at the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Osborne.</NOTE> gracious reception he had met with from his mi&s;tre&s;s. After having changed his apparel, he again vi&s;ited her maje&s;ty, with whom he conferred &s;ome hours in private, and afterwards dined in great good humour. In the afternoon, when he repeated his vi&s;it to the queen, he found her very much altered in her be|haviour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sidney's let|$$$.</NOTE> She taxed him with neglect of her orders, and de&s;ired that he might be examined by the lords in council. Tho&s;e in waiting met immediately; but, after having &s;at &s;ome time, the affair was referred to the determination of a full council, which was &s;ummoned accordingly; and in the mean time the earl was confined to his chamber. Next day he was interrogated at the council-board, touching his contempt of the queen's orders, his making a truce with Tyrone, and his leaving Ireland without her maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion.

The earl of Ormond, who commanded as lieutenant|general, marching again&s;t him with the wreck of the Engli&s;h forces, was fain to conclude a truce, and wrote to the queen for a &s;peedy reinforcement: but be|fore this arrived, the earl drove Owny and Redmond Bourke from Leix and Tipperary.</P>

She determined therefore to convince her people, that &s;he had not confined E&s;&s;ex without a cau&s;e; and ordered him to be tried in the lord keeper's hou&s;e before the council, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the four judges. He was there found guilty of divers mi&s;demeanors, and &s;entenced to be removed from the council-board, &s;u&s;pended from the offices of earl mare&s;chal and ma&s;ter of the ordnance, and detained in pri&s;on during her maje&s;ty's plea|&s;ure.

The earl behaved on this occa&s;ion with great humility, and the queen<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

He had hoped his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive behaviour would have entitled him to a free pardon; but finding him&s;elf &s;till under re|&s;trictions, and having met with a mortifying repul&s;e when he petitioned the queen for a renewal of the lea&s;e by which he farmed the &s;weet wines, his patience for&s;ook him, and all his impetuo&s;ity of re&s;entment awoke. He broke out into unguarded exclamations again&s;t his enemies at court, and did not even ab&s;tain from &s;evere &s;arca&s;ms again&s;t the per&s;on of Elizabeth, &s;aying &s;he was now grown an old woman, and as crooked in her mind as in her body.

Such per&s;onal reflecti|ons &s;he never forgave. She now lent a willing ear to the &s;ugge&s;tions of &s;ecre|tary Cecil, Sir Walter Raleigh, and the re&s;t of his enemies. She rejected with di&s;dain all the petitions and memorials that were pre&s;ented in his behalf by him&s;elf and his relations; and &s;eemed bent upon provoking him to &s;ome &s;tep that would be productive of his own de&s;truction. To the indignation of an incen&s;ed &s;overeign was added the rage of a &s;lighted woman. E&s;&s;ex was &s;ur|rounded by a number of adherents, who poi&s;oned his mind with the mo&s;t fatal coun&s;els. The chief of the&s;e were Sir Chri&s;topher Blount, Sir Giles Meyrick, and Henry Cuffe.

<P>He by letters endeavoured to per&s;uade the king of Scotland that the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters favoured the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the infanta of Spain, who&s;e pretended right had been a&s;&s;erted in a late performance; and he ex|horted the Scotti&s;h king to in&s;i&s;t upon Elizabeth's declaring him her &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or. James was afraid of teazing Elizabeth upon &s;uch a di&s;agreeable &s;ub|ject:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> for he had already &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the king of Denmark, and &s;e|veral other powers of Germany, de&s;iring their mediation with the queen to|wards her doing him ju&s;tice; but they excu&s;ed them&s;elves from giving her any unnece&s;&s;ary offence. Be&s;ides, he was &s;o much embroiled at home, that he would not run the ri&s;que of incurring her di&s;plea&s;ure, at a time when he might have occa&s;ion for her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He was at continual variance with his clergy, who were generally &s;our gloomy pedants, equally in&s;pired with pride and fanatici&s;m. They found him lukewarm to their forms of religion, aver&s;e to their per&s;onal characters; and, by their influence among the popu|lace, &s;ubjected him to divers mortifications. They even refu&s;ed to give public thanks to God for his miraculous pre&s;ervation from the &s;words of the earl Gowry and his brother, who had decoyed him to their hou&s;e in Perth, in or|der to &s;acrifice him to the manes of their father, who had been executed for trea&s;on. James was already removed from all his attendants; and, on pre|tence of receiving a hidden trea&s;ure, conveyed into a &s;olitary apartment, where he found a man &s;tanding in armour. Gowry's brother Alexander, who was his conductor, having locked the door as he entered, told the king that he now would take vengeance upon him for the murder of his father, and draw|ing

a dagger, would have plunged it in his brea&s;t, had not he been re&s;trained by the man in armour, who wrenched the dagger from his hand, d$claring that he &s;hould not, while he lived, commit &s;o foul a deed. The king him&s;elf argued &s;o pathetically again&s;t the perpetration of &s;uch an act, that Alexander was confounded; and a&s;&s;uring his maje&s;ty his life &s;hould be &s;afe, de&s;ired he would remain in that place, until he could &s;peak with his brother. So &s;aying, he retired; but &s;oon returned, &s;aying the earl was implacable, and &s;wearing by God he &s;hould die. He then endeavoured to tie the king's hands with a garter, and James &s;truggled manfully in his own defence. The per&s;on in armour, who was Gowry's &s;ervant, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, opened a window, towards which James pulling his antagoni&s;t, cried Murder! trea&s;on trea&s;on! and demanded a&s;&s;i&s;tance. His voice being known by &s;ome of his attendants who were in the &s;treet, John Ram&s;ay, one of his pages, ran up the back-&s;tairs, and entering the apartment, found the king &s;till &s;truggling with Alexander Ruthven. James de&s;iring him to &s;trike the traitor, he wounded him in two or three places with his dagger, while the man in armour retired another way. Alexander then quitted his hold, and running down &s;tairs, was met by Sir Thomas Erskine, who killed him outright. This gentleman, followed by doctor Hugh Hereife a phy&s;ician, and one Wil$on a footman, repaired im|mediately to the place where the king remained with Ram&s;ay. As they ex|pected an a&s;&s;ault from earl Gowry him&s;elf, they locked their &s;overeign in a clo&s;e$, and prepared to defend the entry. Immediately they were attacked by the earl with a &s;word in each hand, attended by &s;everal armed dome&s;tics; and a fierce conflict en&s;ued. The defenders of James were in danger of being wor&s;ted, when one of them exclaiming, "You have killed the king our ma&s;ter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> will you take our lives al&s;o?" Gowry was &s;o confounded at this exclamation that he &s;et the points of his two &s;words to the ground, in token of a ce&s;&s;ation. He was that in&s;tant run through the body by Ram&s;ay, and fell dead at his feet. His &s;ervants &s;eeing him fall, betook them&s;elves to flight; though not before Sir Thomas Erskine and Dr. Hereife were dangerou&s;ly wounded. By this time the noblemen and their followers had broke open the doors of the ordinary pa&s;&s;age, and ru&s;hing into the chamber, expre&s;&s;ed their joy at the &s;afety of the king, who, falling upon his knees, gave thanks to God for his deliverance. A d$y of public thank&s;giving being appointed, the mini&s;ters of Edinburgh refu&s;ed to ble&s;s God for having protected his maje&s;ty, alledging that it was a &s;ham con&s;piracy. The king and council, therefore, went in proce&s;&s;ion to the market-place, to countenance Lind&s;ay bi&s;hop of Ro&s;s in preaching a &s;ermon &s;uited to the occa&s;ion. After this ceremony, the king repaired to Dumferm|ling to vi&s;it the queen, who had been ju&s;t delivered of a prince, chri&s;tened by the name of Charles, afterwards king of Great Britain and Ireland.</P>

Finding James of Scotland aver&s;e to his propo&s;als, he took under his protection &s;ome pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters, who preached at his hou&s;e; and multitudes of people went thither on pretence of hearing their &s;er|mons. He formed a kind of council, compo&s;ed of the earl of Southampton, Sir Charles Danvers, Sir Ferdinando Gorges governor of the fort of Plymouth, Sir John Daveys &s;urveyor of the ordnance, and Sir John Littleton of Franckel. The&s;e being a&s;&s;embled at Drury-hou&s;e, he produced a li&s;t of individuals, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed attached to his fortunes. It contained the names of a great num|ber of noblemen, knights, and gentlemen.

E&s;&s;ex dreading a &s;econd impri&s;onment, excu&s;ed him&s;elf on account of indi&s;po|tion, and con&s;ulted his friends touching the emergency of his &s;ituation. He was de&s;titute of men, arms, and ammunition; the guards were doubled, and he was aver&s;e to any attempt again&s;t the palace, which would look like open trea&s;on. While he and his confidents were in con&s;ultation, a per&s;on, pro|bably employed by his enemies, came in as a me&s;&s;enger from the citizens, with tenders of friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t all his adver&s;aries. This in|telligence was confirmed by others, who a&s;&s;ured him that Sir Thomas Smith, one of the &s;heriffs, would rai&s;e one thou&s;and men of the trained-bands for his &s;ervice. The earl's vanity being flattered by the&s;e in&s;idious propo&s;als, he re|&s;olved to enter the city next day; and, in the mean time, &s;ent notice to his friends, that the lord Cobham and Sir Walter Raleigh lay in wait for his life. Early in the morning he was vi&s;ited by the earls of Rutland and Southampton, the lord Sandes, Parker, and Monteagle, with three hundred per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The doors of E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e were immediately locked, that none might go forth without permi&s;&s;ion: Sir Walter Raleigh &s;ending a me&s;&s;age to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, this officer vi&s;ited him in a boat upon the river, and di&s;covered all their tran&s;actions. The lord keeper, accompanied by the earl of Worce&s;ter, the lord chief ju&s;tice Popham, and Sir William Knolles, uncle to the earl of E&s;&s;ex, were &s;ent by the queen to learn the mean|ing of &s;uch a concour&s;e of people. Being admitted through the wicket, they found the court-yard filled with the populace. When the lord keeper mentioned the cau&s;e of their coming, E&s;&s;ex replied aloud, that there was a con&s;piracy again&s;t his life; and that his friends were a&s;&s;embled for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on, &s;ince nothing but his blood could &s;atisfy his enemies. The lords endeavouring to expo&s;tulate with him, were interrupted by the multi|tude, which rai&s;ed a terrible clamour, threatening them with in&s;tant death. The lord keeper charged them, upon their allegiance, to lay down their arms, and following E&s;&s;ex into the hou&s;e, was, with his attendants, committed to the guard of Sir John Daveys, Francis Tre&s;ham, Owen Sali&s;bury, and &s;ome mu&s;keteers. The coun&s;ellors being thus &s;ecured, E&s;&s;ex leaving two hundred men with Meyric to defend his hou&s;e, repaired to the city, where he exclaimed in the &s;treets, "For the queen! For the queen! My life is in danger!" hoping to engage the citizens to ri&s;e in his behalf: but they had received or|ders from the mayor to keep within their hou&s;es; &s;o that he was not joined by one &s;ingle per&s;on. Then he proceeded to the hou&s;e of &s;heriff Smith, whom he di&s;patched to the lord mayor, de&s;iring he him&s;elf, or four aldermen, would come and confer with him upon the &s;ituation of his affairs: but, before he received any an&s;wer from that quarter, the earl of Cumberland, with Sir Thomas Gerard knight-mar&s;hal, came into the city, and proclaimed him and all his adherents traitors. This circum&s;tance was no &s;ooner known, than many of the earl's followers &s;lunk away; and he him&s;elf, in manife&s;t dejection, attempted to return to his own hou&s;e, intending to make his peace with the queen, by means of the coun&s;ellors whom he had left in cu&s;tody. Finding

Ludgate guarded by Sir John Levi&s;on, who denied him pa&s;&s;age, he a&s;ked and obtained leave for Gorges to pa&s;s, that he might relea&s;e the coun&s;ellors, whom he forthwith conducted to Whitehall. The earl, in returning towards the heart of the city, found a chain drawn a-cro&s;s the &s;treet, at the corner of St. Paul's, and guarded by armed men, who had been a&s;&s;embled by the bi&s;hop of London. In fighting his way through this ob&s;truction, Henry Tracy, a young gentleman for whom he had a &s;ingular affection, lo&s;t his life; and Sir Chri&s;topher Blount was wounded and taken. The earl, going down Friday|&s;treet, embarked in a boat at Queenhythe, and landing at E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e, began to make preparations for his defence.</P>

<P>He was immediately inve&s;ted by the lord admiral, at the head of &s;everal regiments provided with artillery; and, about ten at night, he, with his company, &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. He and Southampton were immedi|ately conveyed to the archbi&s;hop's palace at Lambeth, from whence they were next day &s;ent to the Tower; and his friends were confined in other pri&s;ons. The mini&s;try &s;till alarmed the queen with a&s;&s;urances that the danger was not yet over. The citizens were obliged to keep double watch and ward; and captain Thomas Lea was executed at Tyburne, becau&s;e he had &s;aid to Sir Robert Crofts, "Might not &s;even or eight hone&s;t fellows, as we are, throw our&s;elves at his maje&s;ty's feet, and repre&s;ent the injury that is done to &s;o many brave gentlemen, who may one day do her good &s;ervice?" This in&s;inuation being reported by Crofts, was interpreted into a de&s;ign of &s;etting E&s;&s;ex at li|berty: Lea was apprehended, convicted, and condemned. He died with great intrepidity, declaring him&s;elf entirely innocent of the crime laid to his charge. E&s;&s;ex and Southampton were tried by their peers on the nineteenth day of Fe|bruary; lord Buckhur&s;t pre&s;iding as high &s;teward, and both were condemned as traitors. E&s;&s;ex, after condemnation, was vi&s;ited by that &s;uper&s;titious devotion which took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind in all his di&s;graces. He was terrified al|mo&s;t into de&s;pair by the gho&s;tly remon&s;trances of his own chaplain A&s;hton; he was reconciled to Cecil, and the re&s;t of his adver&s;aries, and made a full confe&s;&s;ion of his con&s;piracy. On A&s;h-wedne&s;day he was brought to the &s;caf|fold, which was erected within the Tower, and &s;uffered in pre&s;ence of the earls of Cumberland and Hertford, the lord vi&s;count Bindon, the lord Thomas Howard, the lord Darcy, the lords Compton, Morley, and many other per|&s;ons of di&s;tinction: Sir Walter Raleigh retired into the armoury, from whence he &s;aw the execution, at which he could not help &s;hedding tears. E&s;&s;ex ap|peared in a &s;uit of black &s;attin; and, after having made an obei&s;ance to the &s;pectators, confe&s;&s;ed his &s;ins with marks of uncommon &s;orrow and contrition, though he prote&s;ted that he never entertained a thought to the prejudice of her maje&s;ty's per&s;on. His behaviour denoted penitence, not without a mixture of apprehen&s;ion: he re&s;igned him&s;elf intirely to the direction of the divines who attended him; and, after &s;et exerci&s;es of devotion, &s;ubmitted his neck to the executioner, who, with three &s;trokes, &s;evered his head from his body.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> Thus died, in the thirty-fourth year of his age, Robert Devereux earl of E&s;&s;ex, once the minion of fortune, and always the darling of the people. He was a nobleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of excellent and amiable qualities; brave, liberal, and humane; a patron of learning, in which he him&s;elf had made good pro|gre&s;s; a warm friend, and an avowed enemy. His foibles were vanity, am|bition, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reliq. Wot|ton.</NOTE>
<PB N="128" REF="1300">
and an impetuo&s;ity of temper, by which he fell a &s;actifice to the artful<NOTE PLACE="marg">Win$oo$.</NOTE> intrigues of tho&s;e who dreaded his power, and envied his good fortune. His ac|complices Meyric and Cuffe were executed at Tyburn; Sir Charles D$nvers and Sir Chri&s;topher Blount were beheaded: Littleton, Orel, and Sir Edmund-$ain|ha$ were tried and conde$ned but the fir&s;t dying in pri&s;on, the others were pardoned. The earl of Southampton was detained in the Tower till the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of king James, by whom he was &s;et at liberty, and re&s;tored in blood by act of parliament. Elizabeth certainly looked upon E&s;&s;ex with the eyes of particular affection, which in all probability was not extingui&s;hed at the time of his condemnation; for &s;he betrayed great agitation of mind, and even countermanded the order for his execution. But &s;he was provoked by his con|temptuous forbearance to implore her mercy; and being alarmed at his own declaring that his life would be dangerous to her &s;afety, &s;he ordered the &s;en|tence to be executed. He is &s;aid to have made application to her for pardon; but his letters and me&s;&s;ages were intercepted by the earl and counte&s;s of Not|tingham. It does not appear, however, that &s;he underwent any violent tran|&s;ports at the news of his death; though, when her indignation &s;ub&s;ided, &s;he became pen&s;ive and melancholy, and never heard his name mentioned without &s;ighing.</P>

<P>The king of Scotland, when he heard of the earl's being ap|prehended, had di&s;patched the earl of Mar, and the abbot of Kinlo&s;s, as his amba&s;&s;adors to the court of England; and, by the notes with which they were furni&s;hed, we may conclude that he was intere&s;ted in &s;ome project which did not take effect. But the earl being executed before they arrived, they pretended their errand was to congratulate her maje&s;ty upon her happy &s;ucce&s;s in quelling the late audacious attempt. Elizabeth affected to take the compliment in good part; and was even prevailed upon to add two thou&s;and pounds a year<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.</NOTE> to their ma&s;ter's pen&s;ion.

<P>The rebels in Ireland being again put in motion, by &s;upplies and promi&s;es from the king of Spain, the lord deputy marched again&s;t Tyrone, whom he drove from his camp under Blackwater, expelled the Macgeni&s;&s;es from Lecale, took Dundrum, and &s;everal other ca&s;tles belonging to the re|bels, &s;ecured the abbey of Armagh with a &s;trong garri&s;on, advanced as far north as Dungannon, and routed them in &s;everal encounters. Sir Henry Docwra compelled Mac&s;winy Fanagh to &s;ubmit, and retrieved &s;ome ca&s;tles which had been betrayed to the rebels; and Sir George Carew &s;eizing the titular earl of De&s;mond, and Florence Maccarty, &s;ent them to England, where they died in pri&s;on. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of September, a Spani&s;h fleet entered the harbour of Kin&s;ale, and Don John de Aguilla landing with four thou&s;and ve|terans, Sir Richard Piercy retreated with his men to Cork, in obedience to the order he had received. The Spani&s;h general immediately publi&s;hed a mani|fe&s;to, declaring he was come to execute the pope's bull again&s;t Elizabeth, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h the catholic religion. Tyrone and O Donel a&s;&s;embling their forces, re&s;olved to join him; but, before they could advance into Mun&s;ter, the lord deputy had inve&s;ted the Spaniards in Kin&s;ale; and detached Carew to &s;top their progre&s;s on the frontiers: but another reinforcement of two thou&s;and Spaniards landing at Beerhaven and Baltimore, under the command of Si|beure and Alon&s;o O Campo, were joined by O Donel and Tyrone, &s;o as to con&s;titute an army of &s;even thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot, with which they ad|vanced to the relief of Kin&s;ale. In&s;tead of throwing a &s;upply into the place, they were defeated by the lord deputy, with the lo&s;s of twelve hundred men killed on the &s;pot; and O Campo with three Spani&s;h officers were taken. Syriago arriving with &s;even hundred recruits at Ca&s;tlehaven, was no &s;ooner informed of this defeat, than he &s;et &s;ail for Spain, carrying O Donel along with him; and Tyrone retired to his fa&s;tne&s;&s;es in Ul&s;ter.

The Spaniards were conveyed to their own country in Engli&s;h bottoms; and Aguila gave &s;uch an unfavourable ac|count of Tyrone and his confederates, that Philip would &s;end no more troops to Ireland, though he &s;till &s;upplied the rebels with money, arms, and am|munition. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year, a rancorous quarrel broke out be|tween the Je&s;uits and the &s;ecular prie&s;ts in England, which la&s;t accu&s;ed the others as the cau&s;e of all the &s;evere laws which had been enacted again&s;t the catholics; becau&s;e they had been concerned in all the con&s;piracies, and even hired a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to murder her maje&s;ty. Bitter pamphlets were publi&s;hed on both &s;ides. The &s;ecular prie&s;ts were &s;addled with a &s;uperior called Blackwell, attached to the Je&s;uits, who continued to oppre&s;s, and even declared them &s;chi&s;matics; but they appealed to the pope, who revoked his authority. Se|cretary Cecil recommended the &s;eculars to the protection of the French king; but Elizabeth i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, commanding all the Je&s;uits to depart the kingdom immediately; and this order was extended to &s;uch &s;eculars as would refu&s;e to take the oath of allegiance. It was at this juncture that Henry IV. of France ordered the marechal de Biron to be beheaded, for having con|&s;pired with other noblemen to di&s;member the French monarchy. The marechal de Bouillon, who was likewi&s;e concerned in this con&s;piracy, retired to Ger|many, from whence he &s;ollicited Elizabeth's interce&s;&s;ion with his ma&s;ter; and &s;he, by her amba&s;&s;ador, hinted to Henry, that this might be a Spani&s;h &s;trata|gem to infect him with &s;u&s;picions of his be&s;t &s;ubjects; but that prince told the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, his mi&s;tre&s;s had a better opinion of Bouillon than he de&s;erved, ina&s;much as he had actually engaged in the con&s;piracy of E&s;&s;ex, again&s;t her own per&s;on and dignity.</P>

<P>The queen had pardoned him with &s;uch reluctance, that many people imagined her la&s;t illne&s;s was produced from her chagrin at that event. It mu&s;t be owned, however, &s;he had many more powerful cau&s;es of grief and mortification. She was very loth to relinqui&s;h the plea&s;ures of life and royalty. She endeavoured to conceal the ravages which time had made upon her con|&s;titution, even from her own knowledge. She affected an extravagant gaiety both in her dre&s;s and diver&s;ions, and even engaged in a childi&s;h intercour&s;e of love with the earl of Clanrickarde, a young Iri&s;h nobleman, who re&s;embled E&s;&s;ex in his per&s;onal qualifications; but he did not meet her advances with equal warmth, and for that rea&s;on the intercour&s;e was &s;oon laid a&s;ide. She tried to divert her attention from di&s;agreeable objects, by hunting, tourna|ments, and parties of plea&s;ure: but, in &s;pite of all her endeavours, &s;he was &s;eized with the horrors of melancholy. She became peevi&s;h, pen&s;ive, &s;ilent, and &s;ighed and wept in&s;en&s;ibly. Perhaps the faculties of her mind were impaired by long and violent exerci&s;e. Perhaps &s;he reflected with re|mor&s;e upon &s;ome actions of her life, which were contrary to humanity, can|dour, and good morals. She had ju&s;t lo&s;t a friend and confident in the counte&s;s of Nottingham; &s;he had been thwarted by her mini&s;try and council in the affair of Tyrone; &s;he found her con&s;titution decaying; &s;he fore&s;aw, through the exaggerating mi&s;t of jealou&s;y, her courtiers and dependants, &s;hrinking away in the evening of her life, in order to recommend them&s;elves to her &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and her indignation again&s;t the unfortunate E&s;&s;ex having &s;ub&s;ided, &s;he lamented his fate, remembering nothing of him but the amiable &s;ide of his character, and the plea&s;ure &s;he had enjoyed in his conver&s;ation. Such a concurrence of cau&s;es, joined to the infirmities of her body, was more than &s;ufficient to plunge her into an aby&s;s of de&s;pondence. She lo&s;t her ap|petite,
<PB N="132" REF="1340">
and could enjoy no repo&s;e: feeling a perpetual heat in her &s;tomach, attended with an unquenchable thir&s;t, &s;he drank without cea&s;ing, but refu&s;ed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her phy&s;icians. When the archbi&s;$op of Canterbury, &s;ecre|tary Cecil, and others of her council, intreated her on their knees to take what was nece&s;&s;ary for her &s;u$tenance and relief, &s;he peevi&s;hly replied, that &s;he knew her own con&s;titution, and was in no danger. At length, teazed by their intreaties, &s;he de&s;ired they would let her die in quiet. Her melancholy and di&s;temper gaining ground, Cecil and the lord admiral de&s;ired to know her &s;entiments with regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and &s;he &s;aid, as the crown of Eng|land had been always held by kings, it ought not to devolve upon ra&s;cals, but upon her immediate heir the king of Scotland. Having continued &s;itting upon cu&s;hions for ten days, without clo&s;ing an eye, or uttering a &s;yllable, &s;he was put to bed partly by force, and &s;eemed to revive a little: &s;he heard &s;ome<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camd$n.</NOTE> pious meditations, and joined in prayer with the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury.</P>

<P>After &s;he was deprived of her &s;peech, the noblemen of her council de&s;ired &s;he would give &s;ome token of her approving the Scotti&s;h mo|narch as her &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and &s;he laid her hand upon her head as a mark of ap|probation. On the twenty-fourth day of March, about two o'clock in the morning, &s;he expired, in the &s;eventieth year of her age, and in the forty-fifth of her reign. She had given orders that her corp&s;e &s;hould not be touched or &s;een by any per&s;on but her own women: it was therefore not expo&s;ed to public view, but being conveyed from Richmond, where &s;he died, to Whitehall, was interred in the chapel of Henry VII. at We&s;tmin&s;ter, with great magnificence. Elizabeth, in her per&s;on, was ma&s;culine, ta$l, &s;traight, and &s;trong limbed, with an high round forehead, brown eyes, fair complexion, fine white teeth, and yellow hair. She danced with great agility; her voice was &s;trong and &s;hrill; &s;he under&s;tood mu&s;ic, and played upon &s;everal in&s;truments. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an excellent memory, under&s;tood the dead and living languages, had made good proficiency in the &s;ciences, and was well read in hi&s;tory. Her conver&s;ation was &s;prightly and agreeable, her judgment &s;olid, her apprehen&s;ion acute, her application indefatigable, and her courage invincible. She was the great bul|wark of the prote&s;tant religion: &s;he was highly commendable for her general regard to the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; and even for her rigid o$co|nomy, which &s;aved the public money, and evinced that love for her people, which &s;he &s;o warmly profe&s;&s;ed: yet &s;he deviated from ju&s;tice in &s;ome in&s;tances when her intere&s;t or pa&s;&s;ions were concerned; and notwith&s;tanding all her great qualities, we cannot deny that &s;he was vain, proud, imperious, and in &s;ome ca&s;es cruel. Her predominant pa&s;&s;ions were jealou&s;y and avarice; though &s;he was al&s;o &s;ubject to &s;uch violent gu&s;ts of anger as overwhelmed all regard to the dignity of her &s;tation$ and even hurried her beyond the bounds of common decency. She was wi&s;e and &s;teady in her principles of government; and, above all princes, fortunate in a mini&s;try <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Her vanity appeared in her love of $lattery, which &s;he gre$dily &s;wallowed even when it was ful$o$e and ab$$rd; and in the variety and richne&s;s of her apparel, which &s;he continued to wear even in her old age. Her behaviour to Sir James Melvil, when he came as amba&s;&s;ador from Mary queen of Scots, was altogether childi&s;h. Under&s;tand|ing that he had been a traveller, &s;he &s;hifted her
<PB N="133" REF="1350">
dre&s;s every day, that he might tell her which kind of habit became her be&s;t. She asked whether &s;he or his queen was the fairer, the taller, and the better dancer; and when he &s;aid that Mary was taller than her highne&s;s, &s;he an|&s;wered, that then Mary was too high, for &s;he her&s;elf was neither too high nor too low. She directed the lord Hun$don to conduct Melvil, as if by accident, into a gallery, where he &s;hould hear her play upon the virginals. He gue&s;&s;ed the contrivance, and without leave entered her apart|ment. Then &s;he de$ired to know whether &s;he or his mi&s;tre&s;s was the better mu&s;ician. In order to di&s;play her learning, &s;he &s;poke to him in the French, High Dutch, and Italian languages; and detained him two days, until he &s;hould &s;ee her dance a &s;arabrand.</P>
<P>Her cruelty and jealou&s;y were too con&s;picuous in the fate of the duke of Norfolk and Mary queen of Scots. Of avarice and par$imony &s;he exhibited numberle&s;s proofs, in extorting pre&s;ents from noblemen, on pretence of vi&s;iting them at their hou&s;es: in allowing her amba&s;&s;adors in fo|reign countries to live at their own expence, un|til &s;ome of them were ruined; and in carrying on the war again&s;t Spain at the charge of private ad|venturers. When &s;he died, be&s;ides a va&s;t quantity of plate and jewels, &s;he left three thou&s;and robes, none of which &s;he had the liberality to di&s;tribute among her &s;ervants. She rai&s;ed one hundred thou&s;and crowns yearly, by granting licences to Roman catholics and non-conformi$ts, exempting them from the penalty inflicted by law upon tho&s;e who did not regularly attend divine wor&s;hip. She exacted every new-year's day above &s;ixty thou|&s;ands crowns in gifts from her dependants. She entertained &s;pies in all the hou&s;es of the nobility, encouraged informers, introduced the u&s;e of tor|tures, enacted a great number of penal laws; and by the terror of her &s;u&s;picion, which was ge|nerally fatal to the object, drove many gentlemen into exile, that &s;he might pro$ecute them to con|$i&s;cation, and enjoy their e$tates. Her choleric di&s;po&s;ition prompted her often to revile foreign amba&s;&s;adors in the gro$$e$t terms; to in&s;ult her mini&s;ters and &s;ubjects in the mo&s;t ab$&s;ive language, and even to cha$ti$e her female attendants with her own hand. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, &s;he u&s;ed to utter oaths and imprecations in the mo&s;t vulgar &s;tile; and the ladies of her court did not &s;cruple to follow her example. Her great art co$&s;i$ted in cajoling her parliament and people with the mo&s;t flattering care&s;&s;es, the &s;incerity of which they could not doubt, when they found them&s;elves rich and happy under her admini&s;tration.</P>

<P>ARCHBISHOP Bourchier, who crowned Henry VII. dying &s;oon after that ceremony, was &s;ucceeded by Morton bi&s;hop of Ely, who had been &s;o in&s;trumental in rai&s;ing Henry to the throne. One of this prince's maxims was to live well with the clergy: and therefore we find no di&s;turbance in the Engli&s;h church during his whole reign; nor any eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tep of importance, except a regulation of &s;anctuaries, which the king obtained from the pope, who, by way of recompen&s;ing him&s;elf for this favour, &s;ent Ja&s;per Pons as his agent to collect money from the Engli&s;h people for di&s;pen&s;ations from going to the jubilee. We have, in the cour&s;e of the hi&s;tory, mentioned this pontiff's &s;cheme again&s;t the Turks, in which he invited Henry to engage. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or Julian II. wrote to him on the &s;ame &s;ubject; and he amu&s;ed both with general promi&s;es which he had no intention to perform. The af|fairs of the church are &s;o interwoven with the civil hi&s;tory of Henry VIII. in who&s;e reign the reformation began, that the chief eccle&s;ia&s;tical events are there recorded; and indeed there was no room to treat of the Engli&s;h church apart, after it had renounced the papal &s;upremacy. During the fir&s;t eighteen years of this prince's reign, he acted in &s;piritual matters as an humble depen|dant of the Roman pontiff. He exerci&s;ed his pen in defence of the papal
<PB N="135" REF="1370">
authority: he &s;ent deputies to the council of the Lateran, which had been convoked in oppo&s;ition to that of Pi&s;a. He called in all the books of Luther, from who&s;e doctrine two and forty articles were collected, and condemned by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion which Wol&s;ey i&s;&s;ued as legate in England: Henry like|wi&s;e granted a privilege for printing Fi&s;her's book again&s;t the German re|formers; and, upon all occa&s;ions manife&s;ted uncommon zeal for the catholic religion. The cardinal being ve&s;ted with his legatine power, expre&s;&s;ed un|common animo&s;ity again&s;t tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed the new doctrine. Six men and one woman were condemned to the flames at Coventry, for having taught their children to repeat the Lord's prayer, the ten commandments, and the apo&s;tles cr$ed, in the vulgar tongue. Severities of the &s;ame nature were practi&s;ed in different parts of the kingdom, where the reformation began to gain ground. This, however, was the only practice in which the cardinal and the clergy could agree. He a&s;&s;umed a power of calling convocations, and laying them under contribution; and, when they complained of the&s;e en|croachments, he threatened them with a general vi&s;itation. He was &s;up|ported in the&s;e arbitrary proceedings by the king, who reaped the fruits of his exaction, and began to hold the per&s;ons of the clergy in contempt, on ac|count of their ignorance and profligacy. Neverthele&s;s, he &s;till retained his at|tachment to the old religion. When Luther, at the de&s;ire of his patron the elector of Saxony, wrote a letter to the king of England, excu&s;ing the acri|mony and abu&s;e with which he had treated him in his writings, Henry, in his an&s;wer, retorted the other's virulence, in &s;arca&s;ms upon his doctrine, and refu&s;ed to forgive him on any other terms than tho&s;e of his retracting his errors, re|nouncing his wife, and retiring from the world, to pa&s;s the remainder of his days in penance and mortification. It appears from a letter of cardinal Wol&s;ey to the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, that the fir&s;t had formed a plan for a reformation of the clergy; and pope Adrian him&s;elf was &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed in this particular, that the German princes were encouraged to pre&s;ent him with the grievances of the church, dige&s;ted into an hundred articles, containing an account of the luxury, prophanity, avarice, &s;uper&s;tition, and pride of eccle&s;ia&s;tics: but the good effects of the pope's moderation w$re prevented by the cabals and in|trigues of his clergy; and, in England, Henry &s;till continued to pro&s;ecute the<NOTE PLACE="marg">St$ype.</NOTE> Lutherans.</P>

<P>After the fall of Wol&s;ey, we have &s;een in the civil hi&s;tory, the de|mands of Henry upon his clergy; and in what manner they &s;ub&s;cribed to the articles in which they owned his &s;upremacy. Cranmer being appointed arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, the king deliberated with him about the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of mona&s;teries; and it was re&s;olved, that this &s;hould be preceded by a vi&s;itation which in all probability would reconcile the people to the &s;cheme, by bringing to light the vices and impo&s;ture practi&s;ed in religious hou&s;es. Cromwell was created vicar-general, with &s;uch powers as ab&s;olutely &s;u&s;pended all epi&s;copal juri&s;diction; and this power he delegated to his deputies, enabling them to confirm or annul the election of prelates, to &s;u&s;pend or deprive them; to con|vene &s;ynods, try eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, pa&s;s cen&s;ures, and grant pen&s;ions to &s;uch monks as might be willing to quit a mona&s;tic life. Their in&s;tructions were extremely minute touching their inquiry into the doctrines, morals, and be|haviour of abbots and abbe&s;&s;es, nuns, and friars; and they followed them
<PB N="136" REF="1380">
with the utmo&s;t rigour, di&s;clo&s;$ng &s;uch &s;cenes of vice, ob&s;cenity, and im|po&s;ture, as expo&s;ed them to the dete&s;tation of all tho&s;e who retained the lea&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ C$ $word$</NOTE> regard for d$cency and good order. After three hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix ab|b$es had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, when a motion was made in convocation for tran|&s;$$ting the Bible into the Engli&s;h language, Gardiner and the popi&s;h bi&s;hops oppo&s;ed it with all their power; till Henry him&s;elf ordered that the tran&s;lation &s;hould be begun; and it was afterwards printed at Paris. In the mean time, an Engli&s;h b$$k, called the King's Primer, was publi&s;hed, containing the doctrines of chri&s;tianity, &s;et forth in a plain, familiar manner, and expo&s;ing the &s;uper&s;titions of the Romi&s;h clergy.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ $h 1$36.</NOTE> A convocation being held, to confirm the &s;entence again&s;t the king's late marriage, the lower hou&s;e pre&s;ented the upper hou&s;e with fifty-nine opinions meriting re$ormation, extracted from the &s;ermons and writings of Cranmer and the prote&s;tant party. After a long debate, they e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;et of ar|ticles concerning r$ligion, ordaining bi&s;hops to in&s;truct the people in the Bible and the Creed, and to condemn all doctrines that were declared heretical by the fir&s;t four councils of the church; namely, tho&s;e of Nice, Con&s;tantinople, Ephe&s;us, and Calcedon: acknowledging bapti&s;m to be a divine in&s;titution, and condemning the doctrines of the Anabapti&s;ts and Pelagians on that &s;ubject: limiting penance to the articles of contrition, confe&s;&s;ion, and amendment of life, as nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation; and declaring ab&s;olution pronounced by the prie&s;t to be as effectual, as if by God him&s;elf: confirming the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; and defining ju&s;tification to be a perfect renewal in Chri&s;t, the fruit of the chri&s;tian virtues operating both outwardly and inwardly; and recommending images in churches as helps to devotion: exhorting the people to honour the &s;aints as per&s;ons in glory; to prai&s;e God for them, and imitate their virtues; and to &s;ollicit their interce&s;&s;ion at the throne of grace: to retain certain &s;ymbols, as containing my&s;tical &s;ignifications, and &s;erving to lift up the mind to God: &s;uch as the prie&s;t's ve&s;tments, the cere|mony of &s;prinkling holy water, to remind us of our bapti&s;m and the blood of Chri&s;t; of giving holy bread in &s;ign of our union with Chri&s;t, and in remem|brance of the &s;acrament; of carrying candles on Candlema&s;s day, alluding to Chri&s;t as the &s;piritual light; giving a&s;hes on A&s;h-wedne&s;day, in token of pe|nance and mortality; bearing palms on Palm-&s;unday, thereby &s;hewing a de|&s;ire to receive Chri&s;t in our hearts as he entered into Jeru&s;alem; creeping to the cro&s;s, ki&s;&s;ing it, and &s;etting up the &s;epulchre on Good-friday, in token of humility, and in remembrance of his death; of hallowing the font, to|gether with exorci&s;ms and benedictions; recommending prayers for departed $ouls as good and charitable: but, as the &s;cripture did not a&s;certain the pains they &s;uffered, or the place in which they were confined, the people were en|joined to remit them wholly to God's mercy, and to reject the notion of their being delivered from purgatory by the pope's pardons; by ma&s;&s;es &s;aid in particular places, or before certain images. The&s;e articles were publi&s;hed with a preface by Henry him&s;elf; and the emperor made them the ba&s;is of the famous Interim which he granted in favour of the German prote&s;tants.</P>

<P>The pope having &s;ummoned Henry to his council at Mantua, the king prote&s;ted again&s;t the legality and proceedings of this a&s;&s;embly, and was &s;econded by the convocation of Canterbury. Hitherto he had acted under the
<PB N="137" REF="1390">
&s;anction of this authority; but now Cromwell, as his vicar, independent of all re&s;triction, publi&s;hed a &s;et of in&s;tructions to the clergy, inforcing the late articles, and recommending order and di&s;cipline among the people. The&s;e were followed by a new vi&s;itation and di&s;&s;olution of the greater mo$$&s;teries. Some infamous methods were practi&s;ed to per&s;uade and intimidate the abbots and monks into a &s;urrender of their hou&s;es and charters. Henry was re|&s;olved to be ab&s;olute both in church and &s;tate: he had formed a religion of his own, and per&s;ecuted equally the papi&s;ts and prote&s;tants, who refu&s;ed to con|form with his opinions, notwith&s;tanding the remon&s;trances of Melancthon, who by letters exhorted him to a greater con&s;i&s;tency in his doctrines and con|duct. There was not one per&s;on in his dominions who dur$t openly di&s;&s;ent from his &s;y&s;tem, except Cranmer archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; and we have al|ready ob&s;erved, in the civil hi&s;tory, that this prelate was &s;creened from de|&s;truction by the per&s;onal affection of Henry.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; V.</HEAD>
<P>After the fall of Cromwell, the archbi&s;hop was obliged to proceed with great caution, and re&s;olved to befriend the prote&s;tants, by gradually &s;apping the foundations of the Romi&s;h religion. He called a convocation in London, to con&s;ult upon means for putting a &s;top to the per&s;ecution, and re|forming the clergy; he recommended a revi&s;ion of the laws and ca$ons enacted again&s;t &s;imony, perjury, bla&s;phemy, and other crimes, and propo&s;ed a tran&s;la|tion of the Bible, which was actually printed by Grafton, and publi&s;hed by the king's authority. He likewi&s;e, with the king's permi&s;&s;ion, d$creed that the u&s;e of tapers, &s;ilk habits, and other ornaments of images, &s;hould be aboli&s;hed; that a chapter of the New Te&s;tament &s;hould be read in every p$ri&s;h, morning and evening; that the mi&s;&s;als, and other books of liturgy, &s;hould be $$$mined, corrected, and ca&s;tigated of all feigned legends, &s;uper&s;titious orai&s;ons, collects, ver&s;icles, re&s;pon&s;es, and names of &s;aints, not mentioned in the &s;eripture. The king afterwards granted a commi&s;&s;ion to a &s;elect number of the convocation, to draw up a declaration of the chri&s;tian doctrine, for the nece&s;&s;ary crudition of a chri&s;tian man. This performance contained the declaration of faith, the creed, the &s;even &s;acraments, the ten commandments, the Lord's prayer, the Ave$Maria; an article of freewill; an article of ju&s;tification; an article of good works, and another of prayer for departed &s;ouls.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; VI.</HEAD>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e points which Cranmer gained in favour of the reformed religion, in oppo&s;ition to Gardiner, Bonner, and other Romi&s;h pre|lates, the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation &s;till remained in full force, under the protection of the king him&s;elf, who was &s;o bigotted to this article of belief, that many per&s;ons were brought to the &s;take for di&s;believing the real pre&s;ence in the Euchari&s;t. We have &s;een what &s;nares were laid for the de&s;truction of Cranmer; and that they not only mi&s;carried, but even &s;erved to confirm Henry's confidence in that prelate's innocence and integrity. The king was &s;o much convinced of the purity of his intention, that he did not take um|brage at the archbi&s;hop's making a motion in the hou&s;e of lords for mode|rating the proceedings upon the act of the &s;ix articles, which had been the foundation of a mo&s;t cruel per&s;ecution. Though Cranmer was on this oc|ca&s;ion un&s;upported by the other prelates, he argued with &s;uch &s;trength of rea&s;on, that the hou&s;e agreed to the act of mitigation. In the &s;ame parlia|ment he propo&s;ed a dige&s;t of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws; and an act pa&s;&s;ed, autho|ri&s;ing
<PB N="138" REF="1400">
the king to nominate &s;ixteen eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and as many laymen, for re|viewing the canons. Cranmer actually fini&s;hed the draught of a code, inti|tuled Reformatio legum eccle&s;ia&s;ticarum, which he pre&s;ented to the king at<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> Hampton-court; and letters patent were drawn up for authori&s;ing this dige&s;t. Nay, Henry about this time &s;eemed bent upon a further reformation. In a let|ter to the archbi&s;hop, he forbade the practice of creeping to the cro&s;s, and of &s;everal other &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies of popery: but his intention was partly fru&s;trated by the remon&s;trances of Gardiner, who, in a letter to him from the imperial court, where he re&s;ided, gave him to under&s;tand, that if any fur|ther innovations &s;hould be made in the religion of England, the emperor would never con&s;ent to a pacification. This was the true rea&s;on for dropping the &s;cheme of the dige&s;t, in which Cranmer had made &s;uch con&s;iderable progre&s;s. Neverthele&s;s, Cranmer, in obedience to Henry's commands, tran&s;lated the li|turgy, and &s;ome proce&s;&s;ions, into the Engli&s;h language.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VII.</HEAD>
<P>Towards the latter end of his reign, he became more and more ar|bitrary, both in &s;pirituals and temporals. The archbi&s;hops of Canterbury and York, Bonner of London, and &s;everal other prelates, were fain to make con|veyances in his favour, of many manours belonging to their different dioce&s;es, upon very &s;light con&s;iderations; and the&s;e deeds were confirmed by parliament, which had already be&s;towed upon him all the colleges, free chapels, and other<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1$46.</NOTE> remaining religious endowments. In the la&s;t year of his reign, the French king &s;ent over Annibault his admiral, with a propo&s;al for aboli&s;hing the ma&s;s in both kingdoms; and Henry reli&s;hed the &s;chme &s;o well, that he ordered Cranmer to draw up the form of a communion, to be &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of it; but his death prevented it from being put in execution.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VIII.</HEAD>
<P>When Edward &s;ucceeded to the throne, the archbi&s;hop exerted all his influence to complete the reformation. The king had been in&s;tructed by tutors, who were attached to the prote&s;tant doctrines; and the protector openly favoured that religion. Cranmer was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Barlow bi&s;hop of St. David's, Ridley afterwards bi&s;hop of London, and &s;everal other able preachers, who, by their zeal and elocution, contributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of his endeavours. Gardiner perceiving, from the complexion of the mini&s;try, and the inclinations of the people, that he &s;hould be of very little &s;ervice to the cau&s;e of popery, by openly oppo&s;ing the tenets of the reformation, endeavoured to check the progre&s;s of them, by repre&s;enting to the protector, that all innova|tions during a minority, would produce confu&s;ion and di&s;turbance in the &s;tate; and propo&s;ing that matters of religion &s;hould continue as they were left at the death of Henry, until the reigning king &s;hould take the management of affairs into his own hands. Very little regard was paid to his in&s;inuations. A book writ|ten again&s;t the corruptions of popery, and publi&s;hed by Herman archbi&s;hop|elector of Cologne, was now tran&s;lated into the Engli&s;h language, and printed in London by the direction of Cranmer. This performance made a &s;trong im|pre&s;&s;ion upon the minds of the people, which were further enlightened by Marcart's declaration of the ma&s;s, and the paraphra&s;e of Era&s;mus on the New Te&s;tament, which were carefully tran&s;lated and publi&s;hed for the general u&s;e of the nation$ Gla&s;ier, in a &s;ermon at St. Paul's church, affirmed, that the in|&s;titution of Lent was no more than a po&s;itive law; and others preached again&s;t other parts of the popi&s;h wor&s;hip: but, the&s;e were virulently oppo&s;ed by the in|ferior
<PB N="139" REF="1410">
clergy, who derived their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the fees they received by the &s;acraments, and other &s;acramentals, and chiefly by &s;inging ma&s;&s;es for the de|parted &s;ouls of the poor$ for which they charged two pence a ma&s;s. The&s;e therefore were enemies to the reformation, which would have deprived them of bread; and they were &s;upported by Gardiner, Bonner and Ton&s;tal, who de|clared again&s;t all alteration in religion: but, the chief of the party was the prince&s;s Mary, who now openly e&s;pou&s;ed the regulations of her father, and in particular the act of the $ix articles.</P>

<P>On the other hand, the props of the reformation were fir&s;t, the young king him&s;elf, who had been carefully educated in prote&s;tant principles by Dr. Cox, and Mr. Chiek, the protector, the archbi&s;hops of Canterbury and York, Holbeach bi&s;hop of London, Goodrich of Ely, and Ridley elect of Roche&s;ter. Old Latimer was now relea&s;ed, but refu&s;ing to re&s;ume his epi&s;copal function, lived privately with Cranmer. This prelate and his friends obtained letters pa|tent for a vi&s;itation over England, during which all bi&s;hops were prohibited from preaching in any place but in their own cathedrals; and other eccle&s;ia&s;tics were re&s;tricted to their collegiate or parochial churches, unle&s;s provided with the king's &s;pecial licence. The kingdom was divided into &s;ix &s;eparate di&s;tricts or circuits; and the vi&s;itors for each con&s;i&s;ted of two gentlemen, a civilian, a divine, and a regi&s;ter. They were furni&s;hed with injunctions, articles, and ho|milies drawn up for the in&s;truction of the people; and they were accompanied by the mo&s;t eminent preachers, to explain the mo&s;t u&s;eful articles of religion. The common people con&s;idered the prie&s;ts as &s;o many mountebanks, who had &s;ecrets for the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls, and thought nothing was nece&s;&s;ary but to leave their &s;piritual concerns to the &s;kill and direction of &s;uch empirics. Some preachers had run into the other extreme, and per&s;uaded their hearers, that if they magnified Chri&s;t, and depended wholly upon his merits and inter|ce&s;&s;ion, they could not peri&s;h, even though they &s;hould lead the mo&s;t pro$li|gate lives. In the homilies the&s;e errors were rectified. They a$cribed the &s;al|vation of mankind to the death and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t: but they declared there was no &s;alvation through Chri&s;t, but to &s;uch as truly repented, and lived according to the rules of the go&s;pel. The articles and injunctions related to the renunciation of the papal power, the acknowledgment of the king's &s;upre|macy, preaching and teaching the elements of religion in the vulgar tongue, taxing the benefices of the clergy for the &s;upport of the poor, the maintenance of &s;cholars and man&s;ion-hou&s;es, regulating the lives of churchmen, and abo|li&s;hing &s;uper&s;tition, pilgrimages, images, and other ab&s;urdities of the popi&s;h religion. In a word, the in&s;tructions and injunctions contained excellent rules for the reformation of the clergy, as well as of the ignorant laity, and for the advancement of true piety and good morals. Neverthele&s;s, they met with great oppo&s;ition. Bonner received them with a prote&s;tation, that he would ob&s;erve them, if they were not contrary to God's law, and the ordinances of the church. Sir Anthony Cook, and the other vi&s;itors, complaining of this prote&s;t to the council, he was ordered to appear; and though he made a full &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, was committed to the Fleet-pri&s;on. The council being informed of Gardiner's inten|tion to reject the homilies, &s;ummoned him to the board, and expo&s;tulated with him upon the &s;ubject. He affirmed that the homilies contained manife&s;t con|tradictions, and excluded charity from ju&s;tification; he offered to di&s;pute upon
<PB N="140" REF="1420">
this &s;ubject at Oxford, again&s;t any opponent what&s;oever: and he exclaimed again&s;t the paraphra&s;e of Era&s;mus, which he &s;aid was bad enough in the ori|ginal$<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> but much wor&s;e in the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation. Notwith&s;tanding all his ar|guments$ he was likewi&s;e &s;ent to the fleet, from whence he wrote a letter in his own vi$$$cation to the protector, when this nobleman returned in triumph from Scotland: but he was not relea&s;ed till after the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, when he was &s;et at liberty by an act of pardon.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ C$ $word$</NOTE> On the fifth day of November, the convocation met, and Taylor dean of Linco$n was cho&s;en pro$ocutor: Cranmer opened the a&s;&s;embly with a &s;peech, in which he pre&s;&s;ed the members to a further reformation, that the remains of popery might be entirely laid a&s;ide. The lower hou&s;e pre&s;ented four petitions to the upper hou&s;e, praying that the eccle&s;$a&s;tical laws might be reviewed and publi&s;hed$ pur&s;uant to a &s;tatute enacted in the late reign, that the clergy of the lower hou&s;e might be admitted to &s;it in parliament with the commons, ac|cording to ancient u&s;age. That the corrections made by the bi&s;hops and others in the offices of divine &s;ervice, by order of the convocation, might be laid before the hou&s;e; and that the rigour of the &s;tatute for the payment of fir&s;t-fruits might be mitigated. The attendance of the lower clergy in parlia|ment had been two hundred years in di&s;$$e; and therefore no regard was paid to this petition. It was re&s;olved, however, that &s;ome bi&s;hops and divines &s;hould be appointed to labour for the reformation of the church-&s;ervice. In t$is convocation, a motion was made for annulling all canons, laws and u&s;ages again&s;t the marriage of prie&s;ts, and l$kewi&s;e all vows of celibacy; and a re&s;o|lution taken to admini&s;ter the communion in both kinds: this was immediately confirmed by act of parliament.</P>

<P>At the &s;ame time the privy-council publi&s;hed a proclamation, indem|ni$ying all tho&s;e who had omitted bearing candles on Candlemas day, taking a&s;hes on A&s;h-Wedne&s;day, creeping to the cro&s;s, carrying palms, and other ce|remonies of &s;uper&s;tition. They likewi&s;e directed a m$ndate to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, for a general &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of images; and this order was rigo|rou&s;ly put in execution, though not without a dangerous oppo&s;ition. Cran|mer's next care was to form a committee for reforming the offices of the church. It was compo&s;ed of eminent prelates and doctors in divinity, who proceeded with equal accuracy and circum&s;pection. A form being drawn up for the communion in both kinds, was publi&s;hed by the king's proclamation, and the books di&s;tributed through all the pari&s;hes of England. The new book of Com|mon$prayer, and the other offices compo&s;ed by the committee, were extremely di&s;agreeable to Gardiner, who exerted all his eloquence and influence in excit|ing the people to reject &s;uch innovations; he preached openly again&s;t the pro|ceedings of the government, and employed all his emi&s;&s;aries to bring their in|junctions into contempt with the multitude. Accordingly &s;everal dangerous commotions were rai&s;ed, and the Lollard mob being the &s;tronger, became very in&s;olent and l$centious, until they were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the care and vigilance of the admini&s;tration. Gardiner was &s;everal times &s;ummoned before the council, and reprimanded for the liberties he had taken in defending popery; at length he $lat$y told the protector, that as a bi&s;hop, he could not be an&s;werable to his own con&s;$$ence, for omitting to preach upon the ma&s;s and the euchari&s;t,
<PB N="141" REF="1430">
which he conceived to be the principal points of the chri&s;tian religion. He was therefore committed to the Tower, and all his papers were &s;ecured. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1549.</NOTE></P>

<P>The new liturgy being e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the act of uniformity pa&s;&s;|ed, another vi&s;itation was &s;et on foot. The in&s;tructions given to the vi&s;itors imported, That in all pari&s;h-churches the &s;ervice &s;hould be read in a plain au|dible voice, as the people did not under&s;tand it while the prie&s;ts retained the tone they u&s;ed in reading Latin prayers: That &s;ome of the old rites &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, &s;uch as the prie&s;t's ki&s;&s;ing the altar, the practice of cro&s;&s;ing, lifting the book from one place to another, breathing on the bread, and &s;hewing it before the di&s;tribution, praying by beads, and &s;ub&s;tituting a certain number of Ave-Marias for one Pater-no&s;ter. That the prie&s;ts &s;hould exhort the people to remember the box of the poor; and that curates &s;hould preach and catechi&s;e at lea&s;t once in &s;ix weeks: That the communion &s;hould not be &s;old in trentals; and that there &s;hould be but one communion in one church, except on Ea&s;ter|day and Chri&s;tmas, when people came to the &s;acrament in greater numbers; and that no markets &s;hould be held, or bargains made in churches or church|yards, e&s;pecially in time of divine &s;ervice or &s;ermon. Cranmer, at the &s;ame time, held a provincial vi&s;itation, in which the articles were drawn according to the king's injunction. The council &s;ent orders to the bi&s;hop of London, to forbid &s;pecial ma&s;&s;es in St. Paul's church; and to take care that there &s;hould be only one communion at the great altar. Bonner immediately complied with this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> order, and the new &s;ervice was univer&s;ally received, except by the prince&s;s Mary, who&s;e chaplains &s;till continued to &s;ay ma&s;s in her own family, not|with&s;tanding the exhortations, and even threats of the council.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year public di&s;putations were held at Oxford and Cambridge, touching the real pre&s;ence in the &s;acrament. The Lutherans affirmed, That in the &s;acrament, there was both the &s;ub&s;tance of the bread and wine, and Chri&s;t's body together. The prote&s;tants of $$i&s;&s;erland taught, That the &s;acrament was only an in&s;titution, to commemorate the death and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t. Martin Bucer believed in the real pre&s;ence, though he did not think the my&s;tery was to be explained; and Calvin agreed with him in maintaining, that the body and blood of Chri&s;t were really pre&s;ent. Peter Martyr &s;ettled at Oxford, publicly explained the euchari&s;t in the Helvetian manner, and a tu|mult was rai&s;ed on the occa&s;ion. Public di&s;putations were afterwards held in pre&s;ence of the king's commi&s;&s;ioners. Cranmer collected and publi&s;hed all the rea&s;ons again&s;t the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and was an&s;wered by Gardi|ner, under the name of Marcus Con&s;tantius. It was at this time, that the council ordered the laws to be put in execution again&s;t anabapti&s;ts, and other heretics, who began to abound in England, and broach doctrines equally ab|&s;urd and bla&s;phemous. Of the&s;e we have already mentioned Joan Bocher, or Joan of Kent, who&s;e death-warrant the young king &s;igned with the utmo&s;t reluctance. There was another &s;ect called Go&s;pellers, who profe&s;&s;ed the doc|trine of prede&s;tination, from which they made &s;uch inferences, that many peo|ple gave way to their pa&s;&s;ions, under the notion of their being prede&s;tined to &s;uch actions; &s;o that impiety, and even de&s;peration, was often the con&s;e|quence of &s;uch a belief. Luther altered his opinion concerning this tenet, and Melancthon condemned it in his writings: but it was &s;till maintained by Calvin and Bucer.</P>

<P>We have, in the civil hi&s;tory, &s;een how Gardiner was deprived, and the protector di&s;graced. Upon the fall of this nobleman, the hopes of the pa|pi&s;ts began to revive; they even gave out that the old religion would prevail, as the new &s;ervice was nothing more than an act of the duke of Somer&s;et. The council being appri&s;ed of this report, wrote to all the bi&s;hops of England, re|quiring all clergymen to deliver up all antiphonales, mi&s;&s;als, grayles, proce&s;|&s;ionals, manuals, legends, pies, portua&s;&s;es, journals and ordinals, to &s;uch as &s;hould be appointed by the king to receive them; injoining the bi&s;hops to ob|&s;erve one uniform order, in the &s;ervice &s;et forth by the common con&s;ent of the realm: and in particular, to take care that there &s;hould be provi&s;ion made of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1550</NOTE> bread and wine for the communion on Sunday. At the &s;ame time, an act pa&s;&s;ed in parliament, decreeing, That all books of &s;uper&s;tition &s;hould be de&s;troyed; that all images in churches &s;hould be defaced; and that the prayers to &s;aints &s;hould be expunged from all the primers which the late king had publi&s;hed.</P>

<P>Ridley's elevation to the &s;ee of London, and Hooper's promotion to that of Glouce&s;ter, were events that operated &s;trongly in favour of the reforma|tion. Yet, this la&s;t refu&s;ed to wear the epi&s;copal ve&s;tments, which he &s;aid were human inventions, and not &s;uitable to the &s;implicity of the chri&s;tian religion. In vain Cranmer and Ridley exhorted him to comply with this ceremony, as a law injoined by the magi&s;trate, and a matter of little or no con&s;equence in reli|gion. In vain did Bucer and Peter Martyr &s;econd the opinion of the&s;e pre|lates: Hooper continued ob&s;tinate, and was for &s;ome time &s;u&s;pended from preaching. In the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer, John-a-La&s;co was allowed to preach at St. Au&s;tin's in London, to a congregation of Germans, who had fled from their own country, rather than receive the Interim of the diet. They were erected into a corporation, and four other mini&s;ters were a&s;&s;ociated with John|a-La&s;co, though he was &s;uperintendant. At this juncture, Polydore Vergil was permitted to retire to his own country, and to hold the archdeaconry of Wells, with his prebe$$ of Nonnington, notwith&s;tanding his ab&s;ence from the kingdom. Poinet was declared bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, and Coverdale was ap|pointed coadjutor to Vey&s;ey bi&s;hop of Exeter. The book of Common-prayer was reviewed, and many articles of it cen&s;ured by Martin Bucer, who now wrote a book for the king's u&s;e, intituled, Concerning the kingdom of Chri&s;t. Young Edward was bent upon reforming the abu&s;es of the church. He even began to write a di&s;cour&s;e about a general reformation; and it was at this pe|riod, that the journal of his proceedings commenced.</P>

<P>In the beginning of the following year, Bucer died at Oxford, uni|ver&s;ally regretted by all tho&s;e who favoured the reformation. He was a per&s;on of great learning, mode&s;ty, and zeal, and had nothing &s;o much at heart as the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1551.</NOTE> union of tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed the doctrines of chri&s;tianity. The greate&s;t part of this year was &s;pent by Cranmer and Ridley, in preparing the articles which &s;hould contain the doctrines of the church of England, in a conci&s;e and plain form, cutting off the errors of popery, as well as tho&s;e lately introduced by the anabapti&s;ts and enthu&s;ia&s;ts of Germany; avoiding the niceties of &s;choolmen, together with &s;ome points of controver&s;y; and with regard to others leaving a liberty to divines, of following their private opinions, without di&s;turbing the peace of the church. The next care of the reformers was to correct the book of Common-prayer, in which they made &s;ome additions and alterations, which
<PB N="143" REF="1450">
were authori&s;ed by act of parliament. In the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion another act was pa&s;&s;|ed, relating to holidays and fa&s;ting-days$ It was decreed, That all Sundays, with the days marked in the calender and liturgy, &s;hould be kept as holidays; and that the bi&s;hops &s;hould proceed by the cen&s;ures of the church again&s;t the di&s;obedient. A provi&s;o was added, for the ob&s;ervation of St. George's fea&s;t by the knights of the garter; another in favour of labourers or fi&s;hermen, who might work on the&s;e days, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. The eves of holidays were or|dained to be kept as fa&s;ts; and on Fridays and Saturdays, as well as in Lent, ab&s;tinence from fle&s;h was enjoined. Other laws were enacted again&s;t u&s;ury and &s;imony, and in favour of the marriage of the clergy.</P>

<P>After the di&s;&s;olution of this parliament, the chiefs of the reformed religion were employed in devi&s;ing proper rules and regulations for the $ccle&s;i|a&s;tical courts, and all things relating to the government of the church. An<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1552.</NOTE> act had pa&s;&s;ed, empowering the king to nominate two and thirty per&s;ons for making a general reformation of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws; and, during this &s;e&s;|&s;ion, a commi&s;&s;ion was given to eight per&s;ons to prepare the matter for the re|view of the one and thirty, that it might be the more ea&s;ily compiled. This work was chiefly compo&s;ed by Cranmer, and proves that he was the greate&s;t canoni&s;t then in England. Dr. Haddon, univer&s;ity-orator at Cambridge, and Sir John Chiek, were employed to tran&s;late it into the Latin language; a task which they performed with equal accuracy and elegance. It was dige&s;ted into fifty one titles; and the thirty two commi&s;&s;ioners divided them&s;elves into four cla&s;&s;es, in order to revi&s;e, correct, and bring it to perfection: they accordingly fini&s;hed the work; but the king died before it received the royal confirmation. At this period, the clergy were brought into contempt by their extreme poverty. Many eccle&s;ia&s;tics exerci&s;ed the trades of carpenters, taylors and publicans. The rich did not maintain &s;tudents at the univer&s;ities, according to the king's injunctions. The places de&s;igned for poor &s;cholars in &s;chools and colleges, were given to the children of wealthy people: the livings were &s;old in a &s;canda|lous manner, and the majority of the country clergy were &s;o ignorant, that they could hardly read the &s;ervice.</P>

<P>The council of Trent was now &s;u&s;pended for two years, without having made any progre&s;s in the reformation of the church. When it was convoked by the pope, the king of France had prote&s;ted again&s;t it, and threat|ened to call a national council in France. Neverthele&s;s the emperor pre&s;&s;ed the Germans to go to Trent; and Maurice, with the other princes of the Aug&s;|burg confe&s;&s;ion, ordered their divines to con&s;ider of the matters to be pro|pounded in council. They demanded a &s;afe-conduct from the council, as well as from the emperor; and this was obtained, though not in the terms of that which was granted by the council of Ba&s;il to the Bohemians. Mean while the fathers publi&s;hed their decrees about the euchari&s;t, confirming the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. Then they proceeded to enjoin auricular confe&s;&s;ion as ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation. The amba&s;&s;adors of the duke of Wirtemberg moving, that they might have a &s;afe-conduct for their divines to come and propo&s;e their doctrines, the legates an&s;wered, that they would not engage in any di&s;putation with the prote&s;tant divines; but, if they had any &s;cruple, in which they de&s;ired &s;atisfaction, with an humble and obedient mind, they &s;hould have a hearing; with regard to the &s;afe-conduct, they &s;aid it argued a di&s;tru&s;t of the council, to
<PB N="144" REF="1460">
a&s;k a$y other than what was already granted. When the amba&s;&s;adors of Mau|$$$$ $rrived $word$ Tre$t, they de&s;ired that e$ery article might be recon&s;idered: but this propo&s;$l was rejected with d$$$ain. Then they ex$epted to the &s;afe|conduct which had been given, as different from that of the council of Ba$$$$ the l$ga$e$ p$$$i&s;$d to $$ke th$t affair into con&s;ideration. The pope under|&s;tandi$g that the emp$$$r int$$d$d to revive the &s;pirit of former councils, in order $o $word$ the po$$i$ical power, made peace with France, and ordered the legat$$ to pro$$ed in the d$ci&s;$on of the do$$rine, hoping the prote&s;tants would retire from T$ent, in de&s;pair of obtaining their demands.

<P>When Mary a&s;cended the throne, the deprived bi&s;hops were re&s;tored, the prote&s;tant p$elates were &s;et a&s;ide, and the council wrote a letter to the bi&s;hops, attended with a proclamation, forbidding all per&s;ons to preach or ex|pound the &s;criptures without the queen's licence. The papifts, even before they were &s;upp$rted by any legal authority, began to erect altars, and revive the &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies which had been aboli&s;hed. We have &s;een$ in the civil hi&s;tory, how Mary, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of cardinal Pole, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the Roman catholic religion. After the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Wyat's rebellion, in&s;truc|tio$$ were &s;ent to the bishops, enjoining a vi$itation of their clergy, and a re|&s;toration of all the ri$es, ceremonies, and canons of the Roman church. The bi&s;hops who favoured the re&s;toration, were now deprived in their turn; and the jails were filled with prote&s;tant divines. Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley, were committed pri&s;oners by the qu$en's precept, to the mayor and bailiffs of Oxford, where they were obliged to di&s;pute with four popi&s;h divines in public, and treated with the mo&s;t in&s;olent partiality. Tho&s;e who were impri&s;oned in and about London, drew up repea$ed addre&s;&s;es and petitions to the queen and parliament; and th$&s;e being altogether neglected, their friends and parti&s;ans were inflamed into &s;ome indecencies again&s;t the government, which were pro|ductive of a &s;evere per&s;ecution. In the beginning of this reign, a great num|ber of Engli&s;h pro$e&s;tants retired to the continent, and &s;ettled in &s;everal dif|ferent places. Tho&s;e re&s;iding at Franckfort were greatly influenced by John Knox the Scotti&s;h reformer, who exclaimed again&s;t the Engli&s;h liturgy, and was a violent a&s;&s;erter of purity in church-government. The&s;e principles
<PB N="145" REF="1470">
produced a &s;chi&s;m among the Engli&s;h refugees. Tho&s;e who had retired to Zurich di&s;claimed all &s;uch innovations. Knox and Whittingham con&s;ulted Calvin, who di&s;approved of the Engli&s;h &s;ervice. Neverthele&s;s, they agreed to compromi&s;e the difference, and to compile a new liturgy from tho&s;e of England and Geneva. Dr. Cox, however, with &s;ome other refugees, arriving at Franckfort, acquired a majority in the a&s;&s;embly, and fixed the imputation of trea&s;on on Knox and his party. They &s;upported the charge from parts of his own writings, levelled not only at queen Mary, but al&s;o again&s;t the em|peror; &s;o that he was obliged to take refuge in Geneva; and Cox modelled the church at Franckfort according to the Engli&s;h con&s;t$$$tion.</P>

<P>Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Elizabeth to the throne, all the eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal mea&s;ures which had been taken in the la&s;t reign were rever&s;ed. She a&s;&s;umed the &s;upremacy, ejected the popi&s;h bi&s;hops, re&s;tored tho&s;e few of the prote&s;tant prelates who were alive; prepared a &s;et of injunctions that differed very little from tho&s;e of Edward; and gave order for a royal vi&s;itation of the clergy all over England. The commi&s;&s;ioners were chiefly laymen, to whom &s;he dele|gated her whole &s;upremacy. The Engli&s;h refugees now returned to their own country, the greater part of them with &s;trong prejudices again&s;t the church|&s;ervice; and &s;everal foreign princes interceded with the queen in behalf of tho&s;e di&s;&s;enters, that they might be indulged with the liberty of a &s;eparate wor&s;hip. This, however, &s;he would never grant, though they enjoyed a toleration from her connivance. Dr. Parker had been prevailed upon to accept of the archbi&s;hop|ric of Canterbury; and the papi&s;ts affected afterwards to ridicule the irregu|larity of his ordination, which they branded with the name of the Nag's head con&s;ecration; becau&s;e, after he had been con&s;ecrated in Lambeth-chapel, the officers of the court of Canterbury were entertained at a tavern of that name in Cheap&s;ide. It appears, however, from inconte&s;tible evidence, that he was duly con&s;ecrated$ and thus authorized, he proceeded to the con&s;ecration of other prelates, who were elected into the vacant &s;ees. Jewel bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury publi&s;hed a lift of the ab&s;urdities in the religion of Rome; and de|clared from the pulpit, that if any papi&s;t would make good a &s;ingle propo&s;i|tion of tho&s;e he had &s;tigmatized, either from the &s;cripture, or the ancient fa|thers and councils, he would give up the conte&s;t and sub&s;cribe him&s;elf a pro|&s;elyte. He afterwards di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his apology for the church of England, and acquired great reputation for learning all over Europe.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding Elizabeth's aver&s;ion to popery, &s;he did not ap|prove of the marriage of the clergy. She even directed an order to the arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, implying, That no head of a cathedral or college &s;hould keep his wife or family within tho&s;e places; and &s;ignified her di&s;like of mar|riage among the clergy, in a private letter to Parker him&s;elf, who was a mar|ried prelate. The di&s;&s;enters, who about this time publi&s;hed the Geneva Bible, were become &s;o bold and trouble&s;ome with their fanatici&s;m, that the queen found it convenient to check their vivacity, by a proclamation commanding all heretics, whether foreigners or natives, to depart the kingdom in one and twenty days. This &s;erved to keep them within bounds; and the majority of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1563.</NOTE> them thought proper to di&s;&s;emble their opinions. Neverthele&s;s, the wor&s;hip of Geneva continued to make pro&s;elytes, even in the convocation, where &s;ome prelates propo&s;ed a further reformation in church-ceremonies: a propo&s;al

which occa&s;ioned very warm debates, though no innovation was made. They in&s;i&s;ted upon doctrinal points, and &s;ettled the articles of religion as they now &s;tand in the book of Common Prayer. Yet the heats concerning forms were &s;o very violent, that Elizabeth, in a letter to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, required him to exert his authority against tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to conform with the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, threatening to employ more rigorous methods for that purpo&s;e, &s;hould the efforts of him and the other prelates mi&s;carry.</P>

<P>The puritans were patronized by the earl of Leice&s;ter, and Pilkington bi&s;hop of Durham: but, notwith&s;tanding their intere&s;t, Elizabeth re&s;olved to make &s;ome examples. Samp&s;on dean of Chri&s;t's-church in Ox|ford was deprived of his deanery; and Humphrey, pre&s;ident of Magdalen|college, was confined and cen&s;ured. The di&s;&s;enters &s;till gaining ground, un|der the au&s;pices of Beza, a foreigner, archbi&s;hop Parker prevailed upon the queen to publi&s;h a proclamation enjoining conformity to the habits; and &s;ome of the interior clergy were &s;ilenced, &s;u&s;pended, and even impri&s;oned. The puritans are &s;aid to have been clande$tinely encouraged by the je&s;uits, &s;ome of whom were taken in the act of preaching their doctrines, in order to fo|ment divi&s;ions in the church of England. It mu&s;t be owned, however, that if the di&s;&s;enters were thus encouraged, they them&s;elves did not know the real characters of their auxiliaries; for, of all other chri&s;tians, they were the mo&s;t rancorous enemies of popery, and all its adherents. We have el&s;ewhere ob|&s;erved that mi&s;&s;ionaries were &s;ent over from the Engli&s;h &s;eminaries abroad, to foment the inte&s;tine troubles of the kingdom; and, as they wore all kinds of di&s;gui&s;e, &s;ome of them might appear in the &s;hape of puritans, that they might the better avoid the cognizance of the law, and have opportunities of mi&s;|leading the weake&s;t-minded people, who are tho&s;e that are the mo&s;t &s;ubject to the impre&s;&s;ions of fanatici&s;m.</P>

<P>The chief preacher and director of the puritans was Thomas Cartwright of the univer&s;ity of Cambridge; and the tenets in which he di$|&s;ented from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church were the&s;e that follow. He taught that the names and functions of archbi&s;hops and archdeacons ought to be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed: That the office of a bi&s;hop ought to be limited to preaching and praying; and that of a deacon to the employment of taking care of the poor: That the government of the church ought to be ve&s;ted in the mini&s;ter and elders; and that every mini&s;ter ought to belong to a particular congregation; and that his office ought to be conferred upon him by the public choice of the congregation: That no per&s;on ought to be admitted into the mini&s;try, unle&s;s he had the talent of teaching and preaching; and that the &s;ame per&s;on ought to preach, pray, and admini&s;ter the &s;acrament: That nothing but canonical &s;cripture ought to be read in the church: That there ought to be no private prayer in the church$liturgy; but all the audience &s;hould attend to the mini&s;ter, whether preaching or praying: That the mini&s;ter has no exclu&s;ive privilege for burying the dead, which equally belongs to the re&s;t of the pari&s;h: That all portions of &s;cripture, names and di&s;tinctions of God, ought to be treated with the &s;ame degree of regard; &s;o that the people need not &s;tand at the reading of the Go&s;pel, or bow at the name of Je&s;us: That the po&s;ture of &s;itting at the communion is as lawful as that of kneeling or &s;tanding, and ex|hibits a more natural repre&s;entation of a &s;upper: That the &s;acrament ought
<PB N="147" REF="1490">
to be admini&s;tred in private, even to tho&s;e in danger of death: That the &s;ign of the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m is a &s;uper&s;titious practice: That the father ought to pre&s;ent the child for bapti&s;m, and make a confe&s;&s;ion of the faith in which he intends to in&s;truct him: but that there ought to be no &s;et form; nor &s;hould the child's name be given by a woman; nor &s;hould any per&s;on be allowed to engage for the education of the infant, but &s;uch as is qualified to receive the Lord's &s;upper; and all names of pagani&s;m &s;hould be avoided, as well as &s;acred epithets, &s;uch as Chri&s;t, Angel, Bapti&s;t, &amp;c. That matrimony ought to be celebrated at all times of the year; and that it was &s;candalous to take money for a licence to marry at certain prohibited times: That no per&s;ons ought to marry without the knowledge of the congregation: That it is unlawful to fa&s;t in Lent, as well as on Fridays and Saturdays: That the keeping of holidays and fairs upon the Lord's day is unlawful: That kings and bi&s;hops ought not to be anointed; and that the&s;e words, "Receive the holy Gho&s;t," at the or|dination of mini&s;ters, ought to be omitted, as a ridiculous and wicked ex|pre&s;&s;ion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Collier.</NOTE></P>

<P>The&s;e were the opinions e&s;pou&s;ed and a&s;&s;erted by Cartwright, who made &s;uch progre&s;s in his teaching, as alarmed the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. Dr. Chaderton of Cambridge, and afterwards the two archbi&s;hops, complained of him to Cecil and the council. In the next parliament, an act was pa&s;&s;ed obliging the clergy to declare their a&s;&s;ent to the thirty-nine articles; and &s;e|veral canons for di&s;cipline were enacted in the convocation. Two prote&s;tations were impo&s;ed upon the papi&s;ts, and tho&s;e of the reformed religion. By the fir&s;t they acknowledged the queen's &s;upremacy, and di&s;claimed the power of the pope. By the other, they renounced any act or &s;entence of any &s;ynod, church, con&s;i&s;tory, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical a&s;&s;embly, to the prejudice of this &s;upre|macy. Cartwright publi&s;hed pamphlets in defence of his tenets. He was &s;e|conded by one Edward Deringe, who gave lectures in St. Paul's cathedral; and a pre&s;bytery was formed at the village of Wand&s;worth, on the model of the Geneva in&s;titution. Some dignitaries of the church took up the pen and an&s;wered tho&s;e pamphlets. A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued for executing the laws again&s;t nonconformi&s;ts; and &s;ome of the principal di&s;&s;enters were &s;u&s;pended, deprived, and impri&s;oned. The &s;everities exerci&s;ed again&s;t them were chiefly attributed to archbi&s;hop Parker, who &s;u&s;pected them of practices again&s;t his per&s;on. He had always been a bitter enemy to their opinions; and now per|ceiving they were countenanced by per&s;ons of high rank, he complained that the church had no friend at court, but the queen her&s;elf. She ordered the lord trea&s;urer Burleigh to make a &s;evere &s;peech in the council again&s;t non|conformity. She declared again&s;t the religious exerci&s;es of the di&s;&s;enters; and &s;eemed at this juncture inclined to a per&s;ecution; for ten Dutchmen and one woman were condemned to the &s;take for here&s;y. Though the &s;entence was afterwards mitigated into bani&s;hment; yet two per&s;ons of the &s;ame nation were actually burned at Smithfield.</P>

<P>Parker dying, was &s;ucceeded in the archbi&s;hopric by Grindal of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 15$5.</NOTE> York, a prelate of great moderation.

But &s;he ordered him to &s;uppre&s;s them, though they con&s;i&s;ted in nothing but an expo&s;ition of the &s;cripture. He wrote &s;ome &s;trong remon&s;trances in their

favour; and was &s;o inflexible on the &s;ubject, that the members of the St$r|chamber, by virtue of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion, confined him to his hou&s;e, and &s;eque&s;tered him for &s;ix months from his juri&s;diction. The per&s;ecuting &s;p$rk &s;eemed to revive. Two fanatics were put to death; and all the jails of the kingdom were falled with popi&s;h and prote&s;tant recu&s;ans. Gria|dal's &s;eque&s;tration was continued, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit, and alter his opinion of the prophe&s;yings. At length, however, he was re&s;tored to his functions, which he exerci&s;ed, until finding him&s;elf pre&s;&s;ed with infirmides, he re&s;igned his archbi&s;hopric, and retired to Croydon, where he died in a few<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch 1583.</NOTE> months after his re&s;ignation. He was &s;ucceeded by John Whitgift bi&s;hop of Worce&s;tes, at a time when the nation was infe&s;ted by the fect of Brown$$ts, the mo&s;t rigid of all puritans, who derived their name from their founder Robert Brown, a weak enthu&s;ia&s;t of Rutland&s;hire. He had written &s;ome pamphlets again&s;t both church and &s;tate; and Elias Thacker and John Cop|ping were executed for having di&s;per&s;ed them among the people. Brown was &s;aved by the intere&s;t of lord Burleigh, to whom he was related. He con|formed and relap&s;ed &s;everal times, and at la&s;t died in a jail, to which he had been committed for a breach of the peace.</P>

<P>Whitgift harboured the keene&s;t animo&s;ity again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, whom he repre&s;ented to the queen as a &s;ect which re&s;trained her &s;upremacy to a temporary juri&s;diction. Jealous of her power and prerogative, &s;he con|ceived a very bad opinion of the puritans, and finding the archbi&s;hop a pre|late of re&s;olution, according to her own heart, &s;he delegated all eccle&s;ia&s;tical power to him, that &s;he might not be importuned by the patrons of the di&s;|&s;enters, &s;ome of whom were her chief mini&s;ters and favourites. The fir&s;t &s;tep which the archbi&s;hop took, was to pre&s;s the clergy of his dioce&s;e to &s;ub|&s;cribe three articles declared legal by the civilians and judges of England. The&s;e imported, that the bi&s;hop might puni&s;h, by a pecuniary mulct, any per|&s;on, whether eccle&s;ia&s;tic or layman, guilty of any eccle&s;ia&s;tical crime or of|fence: That the ordinary may inflict a pecuniary puni&s;hment upon &s;uch as ab&s;ent them&s;elves from divine &s;ervice, without rea&s;onable excu&s;e; and that a bi&s;hop may make an ordinance, by which an excommunicated per&s;on &s;hall pay ten pounds for every month during which he &s;hall &s;tand excommunicated for contempt. His impo&s;ing the&s;e articles &s;erved only to draw upon him&s;elf a load of calumny and re&s;entment. At length he di&s;puted with the heads of the di&s;&s;enters at Lambeth, in pre&s;ence of the earl of Leice&s;ter and other mini|&s;ters, who, though puritanically inclined, could not help deciding in his favour. Neverthele&s;s, in the next parliament, a &s;trong party in the hou&s;e of commons joined in pre&s;enting a petition to the upper hou&s;e in favour of the noncon|formi&s;ts: but they were baffled by the vigilance of the archbi&s;hop, who pre|vailed upon the queen to qua&s;h all objections to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, in the hou&s;e of commons, and inflict further &s;everities on the di&s;&s;enters. They were &s;ubjected to the oath ex officio, as often as it &s;hould be admini&s;tred, on pain of impri&s;onment. Cartwright was &s;ent to the Fleet for refu&s;ing it. Udal, one of their preachers, was condemned to death; and Penry was exe|cuted for having written &s;ome &s;atyrical libels.</P>

<P>Puritani&s;m, like every &s;ect, flouri&s;hed under per&s;ecution; and almo&s;t all the towns in England were filled with di&s;&s;enters$ As la&s;t, they di&s;puted the legality of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion$ under which they had &s;uf|fered &s;uch &s;everities; and the matter was &s;olemnly argued at the $word$ in an action brought by one Caudrey, a deprived mini&s;ter. Many learned argu|ments were produced on each &s;ide of the que&s;tion; but the judges came to a re&s;olution, that if the act of &s;upremacy had never been made, the king or queen of England, for the time being, might e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch an eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion as was then in force, by the ancient prerogative and law of Eng|land.

James was not all plea&s;ed with the concour&s;e of people that continually &s;urrounded him. Though meanly familiar with his particular friends and courtiers, he was extremely aver&s;e to crowds and ceremony. Per|haps he was a&s;hamed of his ungracious figure, and aukward addre&s;s; and, in all probability, he did not think him&s;elf &s;afe in the mid&s;t of &s;o many &s;tran|gers. Whatever were his motives, he certainly i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, for|bidding all &s;trangers to approach his per&s;on. At York he received the re|&s;pects and homage of almo&s;t all the nobility in the kingdom; and there he favoured &s;ecretary Cecil with a mo&s;t gracious reception, contrary to the ex|pect$tion of every body in the kingdom: for that mini&s;ter had been the in|v$terate enemy of E&s;&s;ex, whom James con&s;idered as a martyr to his intere&s;t; and he was moreover &s;on of that Burleigh who had brought the king's mother<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wil&s;o$.</NOTE> to the block. He had, notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e di&s;advantages, found means to infinua$e him&s;elf into the favour of James, with whom he had carried on a corre&s;pondence during the latter part of the queen's reign. In all appearance he accommodated him&s;elf to the king's notions of government, and rendered<NOTE PLACE="marg">S$owe.</NOTE> him&s;elf nece$$ary to his occa&s;ions, by his wealth, experience, and &s;agacity. This prince had conceived a mo&s;t romantic notion of the kingly prerogative; and, in order to communicate this idea to his people betimes, he commanded a thief to be hanged at Newark, without any form of trial.</P>

<P>When he arrived at Theobald's, a hou&s;e belonging to Cecil, he was vi&s;ited by the council in a body, and augmented the number of the members, with &s;ome of his Scotti&s;h attendants; namely, the duke of Lennox, the earl of Mar, the lord Hume, and Sir James Elphin&s;ton.

Thomas Sackville, baron of Buckhur&s;t, and lord trea&s;urer, was created earl of D$$&s;$t: the $word$ of E&s;|&s;endon was be&s;towed upon Sir Robert Cecil the &s;ecretary, afterwards vi&s;count Cranburn, and finally earl of Sali&s;bury; and Philip Herbert, brother to the earl of Pembroke, was promoted to the earldom of Montgomery. While the king was on the road from Scotland, he had given orders for relea&s;ing the earl of Southampton, who, with the &s;on of E&s;&s;ex, was re&s;tored to his honours and e&s;tate: but the lords Grey, Cobham, Carew, and Sir Walter Raleigh, met with a very cold reception from his maje&s;ty. They had been concerned in the death of E&s;&s;ex, and were now de&s;erted by Cecil, though he had acted as their confederate in that tragedy.

James under&s;tood the general maxims of government in theory; but he wanted re&s;olution to put them in practice.

He was encouraged in the&s;e &s;entiments by Cecil the &s;ecretary, the earl of Suffolk lord chamberlain, and Northampton keeper of the privy &s;eal, to whom he left the chief management of his affairs. Though the Engli&s;h people dete&s;ted the&s;e maxims, they were &s;till more di&s;gu&s;ted by the di&s;agreeable peculiarities of his di&s;po&s;ition. He ne|glected

all bu&s;ine&s;s, to indulge his pa&s;&s;ion for hunting: when the country people a&s;&s;embled in crouds, while he was engaged in that diver&s;ion, he u&s;ed to cur&s;e them bitterly, and prote&s;t he would leave the kingdom, rather than be &s;ubject to &s;uch intru&s;ion.

It mu&s;t be owned, however, for the credit of his admini&s;tra|tion, that he &s;u&s;pended, by proclamation, all the monopolies which had been granted in the late reign to the prejudice of commerce; &s;uper&s;eded all illegal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Str$pe.</NOTE> protections for the delay of &s;uits, and put a &s;top to the abu&s;e of purveyors.</P>

<P>In a little time after his arrival in London, he &s;ent a numerous train of noblemen and ladies into Scotland, to accompany his queen and children to his new dominions. She accordingly &s;et out for England with prince Henry and the lady Elizabeth; but Charles being &s;ickly, did not arrive till the month of October in the following year. James met his con&s;ort at the hou&s;e of Sir George Farmer, at Ea&s;ton near Towce&s;ter, from whence he ac|companied her to Wind&s;or. Anne was a prince&s;s of violent re&s;entment. She had lately mi&s;carried, from a tran&s;port of indignation, at Stirling, where the &s;ervants of the earl of Mar refu&s;ed to deliver prince Henry into her hands; and, although the earl him&s;elf had no concern in this refu&s;al, &s;he would not be reconciled to him, until after &s;he had been &s;ome time in England. When the king removed from the Tower to Greenwich, he knighted two hundred and thirty-&s;even per&s;ons, exclu&s;ive of a general &s;ummons, commanding all who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed forty pounds a year in land, to come and receive the order of knight|hood, or el&s;e compound with the king's commi&s;&s;ioners.

<P>Henry the French king being well acquainted with the weakne&s;s of James, &s;ent over the marquis de Ro&s;ny, afterwards duc de Sully, to compliment him upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of England; but his chief errand was to hin|der the king from being cajoled by the Spaniards, to whom he had a warm &s;ide, and to renew the defen&s;ive alliance which had been made with Elizabeth; de&s;igns in which he &s;ucceeded according to the wi&s;hes of his ma&s;ter. The count d'Aremberg amba&s;&s;ador from the archduke Albert and the infanta I&s;a|bella, &s;overeigns of the Low-Countries, had got the &s;tart of the marquis de Ro&s;ny.

<P>He not only hankered after a pacification with Spain; but likewi&s;e entertained an aver&s;ion to the &s;tates-general, although they had more than once relieved him in his nece&s;&s;ities.

Neverthele&s;s, finding his new &s;ubjects of very dif|ferent &s;entiments; and being convinced by the marquis de Ro&s;ny of his true intere&s;t, he, in his treaty with Henry IV. of France, agreed that they &s;hould be allowed to levy troops in the dominions of both kings, who &s;hould al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t them with the annual &s;um of one million four hundred thou&s;and livres, to be advanced by the French king, though he was at liberty to deduct one third of it from the debt which he owed to Elizabeth.

<P>The plague raging with redoubled force at London, during the heats of &s;ummer, the court retired to Wilton, an hou&s;e in the neighbourhood of Sali&s;bury, belonging to the earl of Pembroke. During the king's re&s;idence at that place, he di&s;covered the plan of a &s;trange con&s;piracy, projected by the lords Grey and Cobham, Sir Walter Raleigh, Griffin, Markham, George Brook, Anthony Copley, and two popi&s;h prie&s;ts, named William Wat&s;on and William Clark. The de&s;ign was to dethrone James, and &s;ub&s;titute in his place his cou&s;in Arabella Stuart. Lord Cobham undertook to treat with the archduke at Bru&s;&s;els, for a &s;upply of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and crowns; as well as to pre&s;ent letters from the lady Arabella to the archduke, the king of Spain, and the duke of Savoy, engaging to take an husband at their recommendation, and grant a free toleration to the catholics. The con&s;pirators had al&s;o agreed that lord Cobham &s;hould demand the king's permi&s;&s;ion to levy two thou&s;and men for the &s;ervice of the Hollanders, and with tho&s;e very troops make &s;ure of his maje&s;ty's per&s;on. They had actually conferred with the count d'Arem|berg, and &s;ettled the &s;hares of the money allotted to each individual. Lord Cob|ham had, by letter, de&s;ired an audience of the lady Arabella, in order to make her acquainted with the &s;cheme; but, in&s;tead of granting his reque&s;t, &s;he forth|with &s;ent his letter to the king. The de&s;ign was di&s;covered by a &s;i&s;ter of An|thony Copley, who being alarmed at an expre&s;&s;ion which dropped from her brother, imparted it to her husband, and he communicated his &s;u&s;picion to the lord admiral. Copley being apprehended, confe&s;&s;ed the de&s;ign. The other con&s;pirators were arre&s;ted, tried at Winche&s;ter, and convicted of high trea&s;on. Raleigh made &s;uch a vigorous defence, and &s;o little appeared again&s;t him, that every body exclaimed again&s;t tho&s;e who found him guilty, though he was at that time the mo&s;t unpopular man in the nation, on account of the part he acted in the pro&s;ecution of E&s;&s;ex. He was now condemned on the &s;ingle te&s;timony of the lord Cobham, a nobleman of weak intellects, and an infamous character. He had even retracted his fir&s;t evidence again&s;t Raleigh, though he afterwards affirmed it; nor was he produced in court upon the

trial. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e appearances of innocence, and the &s;mall likeli|hood of his engaging in &s;uch an unpromi&s;ing &s;cheme, with a &s;et of idle con|federates, divided in intere&s;t, politics, and religion, this great man was un|doubtedly guilty. He had been &s;uper&s;eded in his po&s;t of captain of the guard, and lo&s;t the office of lord warden of the &s;tanneries: his pa&s;&s;ions were turbulent and impetuous; and the tran&s;ports of his re&s;entment overwhelming all his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beaumont Dep.</NOTE> reflection, hurried him into this imprudent con&s;piracy. Ce$il pro&s;ecuted him in the mo&s;t rancorous manner, and Coke the attorney-general reviled him upon his trial in the mo&s;t &s;currilous terms of reproach. George Brook and the two priefts were executed: the lords Cobham and Grey, with Markham, were pardoned on the &s;caffold, even after having laid their heads upon the block; and Raleigh, though reprieved, was detained many years in the Tower, where<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camden.</NOTE> he wrote his hi&s;tory of the world.</P>

<P>Immediately after the di&s;covery of this plot, the king returned from Wilton, and with the queen was crowned at We&s;tmin&s;ter. Then he publi&s;hed a proclamation, forbidding all per&s;ons, who were not immediately nece&s;&s;ary, to approach the court till winter, on account of the plague, which in the cour&s;e of one year had &s;wept off above thirty thou&s;and &s;ouls in London, though the whole number of inhabitants at that period did not amount to two hundred thou&s;and. The papi&s;ts, flu&s;hed with the hope of a toleration, under a monarch who at one time &s;eemed to favour their religion, pre&s;ented a petition for this purpo&s;e: and were not a little mortified when he gave them to under&s;tand that he thought him&s;elf obliged to maintain tho&s;e regulations in religion which he found in force at his acce&s;&s;ion. Though James was no$ enemy to the catholic religion, he was extremely aver&s;e to their attachment to the court of Rome, and the power of the papacy; and Cecil had per&s;uaded him that a toleration was incompatible with his regal power and pterogative. The puritans flattering them&s;elves with the hope of a more favourable an&s;wer from a prince who had been educated in their religion, petitioned not only for a toleration, but likewi&s;e demanded that he would give order for reforming &s;ome articles of the Engli&s;h doctrine and di&s;cipline with which they could not conform. There was no &s;et of people which James dete&s;ted &s;o much as the puritans. The Scotti&s;h pre&s;byterians had thwarted him on many occa&s;ions: they had treated his per&s;on with indecent familiarity, and his power with di&s;|re&s;pect; and the republican &s;pirit by which they were animated could not but be extremely odious to a prince who prided him&s;elf in cheri&s;hing the mo&s;t arbitrary maxims of ab&s;olute monarchy.</P>

<P>He had by this time joined in the Engli&s;h communion, and re&s;olved to oblige the di&s;&s;enters to a conformity with the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion: but, with a view to maintain the appearance of impartiality, he de&s;ired that a con|ference might be held between &s;ome bi&s;hops and mini&s;ters of the puritan party at Hampton-court, where the king appeared in per&s;on, not as a judge, but<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1604.</NOTE> with all the zeal of a warm parti&s;an. He began with declaring that he would not alter one tittle of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion; and, indeed, they did not di&s;|&s;ent &s;o much in doctrinal points as in the exterior forms of wor&s;hip, and in the government of the hierarchy. They complained that the churches were filled with ignorant pa&s;tors; that they were obliged to conform to the book of Common Prayer, that contained many things which their con&s;ciences could
<PB N="157" REF="1590">
not dige&s;t; that the clergy were &s;ubjected to the cen&s;ure of laymen, by means of the high commi&s;&s;ion-court, which exerci&s;ed the king's eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;upremacy: that the &s;ign of the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m, the ring in marriage, and the &s;urplice worn by the prie&s;ts, were &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies, and remnants of popery. The&s;e important articles produced warm debates, in which the king mingled with great eagerne&s;s. The chancellor exclaimed that he had often heard the prie&s;thood was united to royalty; but now he was convinced of that truth by the learned arguments of his maje&s;ty. Archbi&s;hop Whitgift carried his flat|tery<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wil&s;on. Coke.</NOTE> &s;till higher, in declaring, he was per&s;uaded that the king &s;poke from the immediate in&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t. The puritans, far from reaping any advantage from this conference, were exhorted to conform to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and even threatened with &s;evere pro&s;ecution, in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience. If there was any &s;tate &s;cheme on the part of the king, in this di&s;putation, it was to per&s;uade the public that the mini&s;ters of the puritans were fairly con|futed, and that nothing but ob&s;tinacy hindered them from uniting with the church; but in all probability he had no other de&s;ign in propo&s;ing the confe|rence than that of enjoying an opportunity to di&s;play his learning.</P>

<P>In a few weeks after this fruitle&s;s conference, the metropolitan &s;ee of Canterbury became vacant by the death of archbi&s;hop Whitgift, who was &s;ucceeded by Richard Bancroft, a declared enemy of the prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters, again&s;t whom he rai&s;ed &s;uch a per&s;ecution, that a great number of families re|tired to other countries, where they could enjoy liberty of con&s;cience. In the latter end of February, a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, commanding all Je|$uits and prie&s;ts ordained by foreign power, to leave the kingdom; and this was followed by another again&s;t the prote&s;tant nonconformi&s;ts. A third was publi&s;hed, prohibiting all per&s;ons from hunting but &s;uch as were duly quali|fied. A fourth ordained that an annual fe&s;tival &s;hould be kept in remembrance of the king's miraculous deliverance from the con&s;piracy of Gowry; and, in a word, &s;o many ordinances of this &s;ort appeared, that this was called the reign of proclamations. In that by which the parliament was convoked, he exhibited a &s;trong &s;pecimen of his arbitrary di&s;po&s;ition. He commanded the counties and boroughs to return members of &s;uch qualifications as he de&s;cribed, on pain of their being excluded from parliament; and threatened any city, borough, or corporation, which &s;hould act contrary to this order, with fine and deprivation of privileges. On the fifteenth day of March, the king and queen rode in proce&s;&s;ion through the &s;treets of London, which was now free from the plague; and, on the &s;eventh day of July, the parliament met at We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>

<P>To this a&s;&s;embly James made a long harangue, expatiating upon the happine&s;s of the nation in his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne; explaining his &s;enti|ments of religion, and inforcing the maxims of his government. It was a cold, tedious, diffu&s;e oration, &s;tuffed with pedantic conceits, c$lled and &s;tudied for the occa&s;ion; and formed a natural picture of his own di&s;po&s;ition and character, the &s;tronge&s;t features of which were his &s;ublime notion of the pre|rogative, his aver&s;ion to the puritans, his tenderne&s;s $owards the Roman ca|tholics, his vanity and &s;elf-importance. In&s;tead of that admiration with which he hoped to in&s;pire his audience, he met with little el&s;e than di&s;appro|bation and contempt. The members were offended at the expre&s;&s;ions he
<PB N="158" REF="1600">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> u&s;ed in favour of the Roman catholics, whom he promi&s;ed to meet half way in the road of reformation. The puritans were incen&s;ed to find them&s;elves repre&s;ented by the king as a &s;ect of republicans that ought not to be tolerated in a monarchical government; and the nation in general were di&s;gu&s;ted at his comparing Scotland with England, as one equal half of the i&s;land, which he wi$hed to &s;ee united under the &s;ame religion, laws, and government. The bu&s;ine&s;s with which the parliament began, was an act to acknowledge and con|firm his title to the crown of England, though he would have willingly di&s;|pen&s;ed with this mark of their regard, as he depended intirely on his heredi|$ary title. His branding the Puritans, without di&s;tinction, as men of a turbu|lent and republican &s;pirit, not only alienated that powerful &s;ect from all af|fection to him and his family, but al&s;o obliged them, for their own pre&s;erva|tion, to unite and coale&s;ce with the political malecontents of the kingdom; and this junction formed a party &s;trong enough to &s;hake the Engli&s;h mo|narchy to its foundation. As James had, in his proclama$ion for convoking the parliament, &s;truck at the freedom of election, the hou&s;e of commons took the fir&s;t opportunity of a&s;certaining their own privileges. Sir Francis Good|win being returned for the county of Bucks, was pronounced an out-law by the chancellor. His &s;eat was vacated; a writ i&s;&s;ued for a new election, and Sir John Forte&s;cue cho&s;en in his room. The hou&s;e rever&s;ed the chancellor's decree, and re&s;tored Sir Francis to his &s;eat. They refu&s;ed to hold a confe|rence with the lords on this &s;ubject. In a remon&s;trance to the king, they main|tained, that though the returns were made into chancery, the right of judging elections belonged to the hou&s;e: yet they afterwards appointed a committee to confer with the judges before the king and council; and, in order to &s;ave the honour of the king, who $a$ere&s;ted him&s;elf warmly in this affair, they agreed to an expedient which he propo&s;ed; namely, that both Goodwin and Forte&s;cue &s;hould be &s;et a&s;ide, and a writ be i&s;&s;ued, by warrant of the hou&s;e, for a new election: thus, however, they &s;ecured their own right of judging &s;olely in their own elections and returns. This was the fir&s;t effort of that parliamentary &s;pirit which in the next reign became too powerful for the &s;overeign. The commons were no longer a pa&s;&s;ive h$rd, ob&s;equious to the will of an imperi|ous monarch. They had acquired wealth and property from traffic: their ideas were exp$nded by learning and commerce, which had now made con|&s;iderable progre&s;s in many parts of Europe, as well as in England$ and they were fired with a &s;pirit of independence, which they had now an opportunity of exerting to advantage, under a weak prince, a foreigner, who did not un|der&s;tand the genius of his &s;ubjects, and who, in&s;tead of conciliating their af|fection, incurred the hatred of a powerful party, by his ridiculous and impo|litic di&s;tinctions. James had nothing &s;o much at heart as the union of the two kingdoms. This &s;eems to have been his chief aim in a&s;&s;embling the parliament, which he thought he had eloquence enough to per&s;uade into &s;uch a mea&s;ure. They accordingly appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with tho&s;e of Scotland; but they were too much incen&s;ed at the king's parti|ality<NOTE PLACE="marg">W$$$on.</NOTE> for his own countrymen to deliberate in earne&s;t upon the propo&s;al. In the mean time, James, in order to aboli&s;h the di&s;tinction of England and Scotland, a&s;&s;umed the title of king of Great Britain; joined the armorial en&s;igns of the two kingdoms; and, by an expre&s;s proclamation, rendered

<P>Immediately after the prorogation, a treaty of peace with Spain was concluded at London, as al&s;o another that wholly related to commerce. They were negotiated by Taxis and Richardot, and afterwards &s;igned by the con&s;table of Ca&s;tile, who came over from the Low Countries for that purpo&s;e. The mo&s;t remarkable article of this peace, imported, That James &s;hould fix a day before the expiration of which the &s;tates of the United Provinces &s;hould make peace with the archduke; and in ca&s;e of their refu&s;al, the king of England &s;hould deem him|&s;elf ab&s;olved from all engagements with that confederacy. Neverthele&s;s, he neither fixed the time, nor withdrew his troops from their &s;ervice: nay, he even re&s;tored the places they had mortgaged, on payment of a much &s;maller &s;um than that for which they were depo&s;ited. It was after the conclu&s;ion of this treaty, that the town of O&s;tend capitulated, having been three years be&s;ieged by the Spaniards, who found nothing in the place but heaps of ruins, in recompence for the va&s;t &s;ums of money, and the incredible number of lives which had been expended in the conque&s;t. James, without concerning him&s;elf about the fate of this fortre&s;s, re&s;olved to improve his new connexion with Spain; and the earl of Nottingham lord high admiral was appointed his amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to that court, for which he took his departure with a very nume|rous and magnificent retinue; while the earl of Hertford was di&s;patched as envoy to Bru&s;&s;els. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Baker.</NOTE></P>

<P>James had not long enjoyed the benefit of this pacification, when he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1605.</NOTE> was expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger, by one of the blacke&s;t con&s;piracies that ever was hatched. The laws again&s;t popi&s;h recu&s;ants had been put in execution; and their e&s;tates were &s;eque&s;tered, and a&s;&s;igned to courtiers, with whom they were forced to compound. The&s;e &s;everities, inflicted by a prince from whom the papi&s;ts expected the milde&s;t treatment, exa&s;perated them to &s;uch a degree, that the ruin of him and his family became their con&s;tant wi&s;h and prayer; and &s;ome bigots of that per&s;ua&s;ion devoted him to de&s;truction. Robert Cate&s;by of A&s;hby, and Francis Tre&s;ham of Ru&s;hton in Northampton&s;hire, encouraged by Henry Garnet &s;uperior of the Engli&s;h je&s;uits in England, had immediately before the death of Elizabeth &s;ent Thomas Winter to Spain, to &s;ollicit an inva&s;ion of their own country; and even after the death of that prince&s;s, they employed other emi&s;&s;aries to carry on the negotiation; but all their mea&s;ures were broken by the la&s;t treaty between James and Philip: and they concerted a new &s;cheme of a much more horrible nature. The invention is charged to Cate&s;by, who propo&s;ed that the hou&s;e of lords &s;hould be blown up with gunpowder at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, when the king, queen, prince of Wales, with all the lords &s;piritual and temporal, the judges, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons of the kingdom would be pre&s;ent. Their purpo&s;e was, after this dreadful ma&s;&s;acre &s;hould have been effected, to &s;ecure the per&s;on of the prince&s;s Elizabeth, who lived with her governe&s;s the
<PB N="160" REF="1620">
lady Harrington, at Combe near Coventry, proclaim her queen, and charge the mi&s;chief on the puritans. For the execution of this infernal &s;cene, Piercy one of the con&s;pirators hired a vault or cellar immediately under the hou&s;e of lords; and by means of Fawkes an old &s;oldier, whom they had brought from Flanders, conveyed into it thirty barrels of gunpowder, artfully covering them with billets and faggots, as a &s;tore of &s;ewel which Piercy had provided for the winter. Private attachment hath often prevented public calamity. Before the parliament met, William Parker lord Monteagle, received a letter from one of the con&s;pirators, probably from Tre&s;ham, who was kin&s;man to his lady, ad|vi&s;ing him to be ab&s;ent from the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion; for, God and man had con|curred to puni&s;h the wickedne&s;s of the times; and intimating, that the parlia|ment would &s;u&s;tain a terrible blow, without knowing from whom it &s;hould come. He likewi&s;e ob&s;erved, that the danger would be pa&s;t in as little time as he &s;hould take to burn the letter. Monteagle being puzzled by this adver|ti&s;ement, carried it at midnight to the earl of Sali&s;bury, who being as much perplexed as the other, about the meaning of tho&s;e enigmatical expre&s;&s;ions, con|&s;ulted the earl of S$$folk, who was lord chamberlain. The letter was after|wards imparted to the earls of Nottingham, Worce&s;ter, and Northampton, before the king came to We&s;tmin&s;ter from Roy&s;ton. James having carefully peru&s;ed this dark intimation, is &s;aid to have gue&s;&s;ed the de&s;ign of the con&s;pirators; and though many people believed he was on this occa&s;ion prompted by Cecil, who made this little &s;acrifice to the king's vanity, no rea&s;on appears in hi&s;tory for depriving him of the honour of the di&s;covery. Per&s;onal timidity was one of his principal foibles, which he is &s;aid to have inherited from his mother's womb; and derived from the fright &s;he underwent at the murder of Riccio. Fear is ever quick-&s;ighted; and the imagination of &s;uch a prince mu&s;t have been always teeming with tho&s;e ideas that were the mo&s;t dreadful to his apprehen|&s;ion. Nothing is &s;o terrible $o a coward as the effect of gunpowder; and this having been uppermo&s;t in the recollection of James, no wonder that he &s;hould interpret into an explo&s;ion, the &s;udden, un&s;een blow that &s;hould come without their &s;eeing who hart them, and have its effect in as little time as a man would take to burn a letter. It was re&s;olved, that the hou&s;es and vaults adjoining, and belonging to the hou&s;e of peers, &s;hould be &s;earched on the eve of the in|tended meeting of the parliament. On the fourth day of November the lord chamberlain, accompanied by the lord Monteagle, went as u&s;ual, to take a &s;light &s;urvey of the neighbouring hou&s;es; and the cellar being left open, to avoid &s;u&s;|picion, perceived an extraordinary quantity of wood, which he thought Piercy could not po&s;&s;ibly con&s;ume for his own u&s;e in one winter. This circum&s;tance augmented his &s;u&s;picion, and Sir Thomas Knevet &s;teward of We&s;tmin&s;ter was ordered, o$ $word$ of &s;earching for &s;tolen tape&s;try, to &s;ee the wood removed, that if there was any thing underneath, it might appear. He went thither at midnight, with proper attendants, and apprehending Fawkes at the cellar|door, in his boots, with a dark lanthorn in his hand, found a tinder-box, and three matches in his pockets; then the wood being removed, they di&s;covered the barrels of gunpowder. He appeared as Piercy's &s;ervant, and was hardened enough to avow his de&s;ign, when examined before the council; but, he refu&s;ed to di&s;cover his accomplices, who hearing of his being apprehended, fled into different parts of the country. Cate&s;by, Piercy, and the chief of the con&s;pira|tors,
<PB N="161" REF="1630">
retired to Warwick&s;hire, in hope of rai&s;ing, by the intere&s;t of Sir Everhard Digby, a &s;ufficient number of recu&s;ants to &s;eize the prince&s;s Elizabeth, who was immediately removed to Coventry: &s;o that this de&s;ign was al&s;o prevented. Then they repaired to Holbech in Stafford&s;hire, the &s;eat of Sir Stephen Littleton; and there they were inve&s;ted by Sir Richard Wal&s;h high &s;heriff of Worce&s;ter|&s;hire, with his po&s;&s;e, as they had broke open &s;tables, and &s;tole hor&s;es in the ad|joining counties. In preparing for their defence, they met with a mi&s;erable di&s;|appointment in the explo&s;ion of their gunpowder, by which &s;ome of them were terribly &s;corched. Neverthele&s;s, their ca&s;e being de&s;perate, they re&s;olved to force a pa&s;&s;age through their a&s;&s;ailants. Cate&s;by, Piercy, and the two Winters were killed on the &s;pot; Graunt, Digby, Rookwood, and Bates were taken and conveyed to London, where they di&s;covered all the circum&s;tances of the con|&s;piracy. Tre&s;ham being afterwards apprehended, confe&s;&s;ed the whole plot, and was impri&s;oned in the Tower, where he died of a &s;trangury. The earl of Northumberland being committed to the cu&s;tody of the archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, was afterwards condemned in a fine of thirty thou&s;and pounds, for hav|ing admitted Piercy into the band of pen&s;ioners, without exacting from him the oath of &s;upremacy. On the twenty-&s;eventh day of January, eight of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>The parliament meeting on the appointed day, adjourned to the ninth of November, when the king, in a long &s;peech, a&s;&s;umed the merit of hav|ing unriddled the my&s;terious letter; and, in order to manife&s;t his tenderne&s;s to the catholics, di&s;tingui&s;hed between tho&s;e who acknowledged the pope's &s;upremacy, and &s;uch as were good &s;ubjects to their &s;overeign, though they belived in tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation, and other &s;chola&s;tic dogmas of the Roman church. At the &s;ame time he did not fail to di&s;clo&s;e his aver&s;ion to the puritans, whom he repre&s;ented as a &s;ect that de&s;erved to be puni&s;hed with penal fire, becau&s;e they believed that no papi&s;t could be &s;aved; as if this was not a reproach that might have been much more ju&s;tly levelled again&s;t the whole body of catholics: but, this is one of the many ab&s;urdities of his rancorous partiality again&s;t tho&s;e who were &s;uppo&s;ed to favour republican principles. The two hou&s;es having pa&s;&s;ed an act, for ob&s;erving the fifth day of November as an annual thank&s;|giving for the deliverance of the king and parliament, proceeded to take mea&s;ures for the di&s;covery of popi&s;h recu&s;ants, and the prevention of their trea|&s;onable de&s;igns. In one &s;tatute they enacted, That tho&s;e who &s;hould be found guilty of having ab&s;ented them&s;elves from the church for one whole month, &s;hould forfeit two thirds of their e&s;tates: That all conformi&s;ts &s;hould receive
<PB N="162" REF="1640">
the &s;acrament once a-year in their pari&s;h-churches: That all recu&s;ants &s;hould take a new oath of allegiance, renouncing the papal power, of ab&s;olving &s;ubjects from the obedience due to their &s;overeign; and abjuring, as impious and he|retical, that damnable doctrine of Rome, implying, That princes excommuni|cated, or deprived by the pope, might be depo&s;ed, or murdered by their &s;ub|jects. But, the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;tep taken again&s;t the catholics, was another act, prohibiting popi&s;h recu&s;ants from coming within ten miles of London, or going to the di&s;tance of five miles from their own hou&s;es, without &s;pecial licence &s;igned by four ju&s;tices of the peace: from practi&s;ing law or phy&s;ic: from act|ing as judges, clerks, or officers in any corporation, or as executors or admini|&s;trators: from pre&s;enting to livings, &s;chools, or ho&s;pitals: and rendering their children incapable of inheriting e&s;tates, &s;hould they omit taking the oath of allegiance at the age of eighteen. The&s;e acts, however, dictated by the re&s;ent|ment of the nation, were not rigorou&s;ly put in execution; though the majority of the catholics, with Blackwell their &s;uperior, con&s;ented to take the oath of allegiance, notwith&s;tanding a brief of pope Urban VIII. who forbade them to comply on pain of eternal damnation.</P>

<P>The mutual danger to which the king and parliament had been ex|po&s;ed from the gunpowder plot, &s;eemed to increa&s;e their regard for each other; and the commons indulged him with a &s;ub&s;idy which amounted to four hun|dred thou&s;and pounds. This was a very &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply for enabling him to entertain his brother-in-law the king of Denmark, and the prince of Vaudemont third &s;on of the duke of Savoy, who vi&s;ited his court in the cour&s;e of this &s;um|mer, and were regaled at an incredible expence with plays, balls, ma&s;ks, and in|terludes, which did more honour to the ho&s;pitality than to the ta&s;te and inven|tion of the entertainer. The prorogation of the parliament being expired, James earne&s;tly exhorted the two hou&s;es to bring the union of the two king|doms to perfection; and Bacon the &s;ollicitor-general recommended it in a very<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1607.</NOTE> eloquent harangue. The king had already publi&s;hed a proclamation, declar|ing all tho&s;e who were born &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of England, natu|ralized in both kingdoms. Hearing the two hou&s;es were very backward in proceeding upon this &s;ubject, he &s;ent for them to Whitehall, where he under|took to an&s;wer all their objections; and told them they would be guilty of a double iniquity, &s;hould they refu&s;e to grant his reque&s;t. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e eager remon&s;trances, the parliament would not agree to the union; and all he could obtain was, a revocation of the ho&s;tile laws &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two nations. The Engli&s;h objected to an union with a kingdom &s;o inferior to their own in power, riches, and extent; to the difference of laws and cu&s;toms; and to the antient league between France and Scotland: but, the real &s;ource of their aver&s;ion to this mea&s;ure was a national animo&s;ity, inflamed by the king's partial di&s;tribution of his favours. Sir Chri&s;topher Pigot knight of the &s;hire for Bucks, launched out into invectives again&s;t the Scots, whom he reviled as proud fellows, robbers, beggars, rebels, and traitors. He &s;aid twenty Scots were not worth one Engli&s;hman: and that there was no more compari&s;on between the one and the other, than between a judge on the bench and a thief at the bar. The natives of Scotland who belonged to the court were &s;o incen&s;ed at the&s;e reflections, that they not only retorted the obloquy, with menaces of revenge, but al&s;o pre&s;ented a formal complaint to the king, who entered warmly into
<PB N="163" REF="1650">
the re&s;entment of his countrymen, thinking him&s;elf in&s;ulted in the general re|proach. The hou&s;e being informed of his maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure, ordered Pigot to be brought to the bar, where he qualified his expre&s;&s;ions by prote&s;ting, that he did not mean to revile the whole Scotti&s;h nation; but, that his words related only to &s;ome part of the We&s;tern i&s;lands. Notwith&s;tanding this explanation, he was expelled the hou&s;e, and committed to pri&s;on. Yet, after the rece&s;s of par|liament during the Ea&s;ter holidays, many members &s;poke with great acrimony in contempt of the king's per&s;on, and even pronounced the Scots happy, in being remote from the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a prince. James was &s;o exa&s;perated at the&s;e indecent freedoms, that in a &s;peech to the parliament, he declared, &s;ince they wi&s;hed his ab&s;ence, he would either re&s;ide alternately in England and Scot|land, or fix his habitation at York or Berwick. The commons intended to have de&s;ired, in an addre&s;s, that he would not li&s;ten to private reports, but learn the &s;en&s;e of the hou&s;e from the mouth of the &s;peaker; that he would give tho&s;e members whom he had blamed, an opportunity to clear them&s;elves in his pre|&s;ence; and allow them to &s;peak freely in parliament on any &s;ubject that might fall under their cognizance. The king being apprized of their intention, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age, importing, That he was extremely tender of their privileges; and that every member might &s;peak freely, though with mode&s;ty and di&s;cretion. When they had pa&s;&s;ed the bill for aboli&s;hing the laws of ho&s;tility again&s;t the Scotti&s;h nation, he prorogued the parliament to the &s;ixteenth day of Novem|ber, and the prorogation was afterwards continued.</P>

<P>At this period, an in&s;urrection happened in the counties of Nor|thampton, Warwick, and Leice&s;ter. The pea&s;ants a&s;&s;embled to the number of four thou&s;and, under the command of John Reynolds, known by the appella|tion of captain Pouch, and for a whole month, employed them&s;elves in demo|li&s;hing parks and inclo&s;ures. The &s;heriffs rai&s;ing their po&s;&s;es, wor&s;ted them in &s;everal encounters: at length they di&s;per&s;ed, in con&s;equence of a proclamation, promi&s;ing redre&s;s of their grievances; and captain Pouch with &s;ome other ring|leaders being taken, were executed for high trea&s;on. In the beginning of this reign, the lord Montjoy had brought the earl of Tyrone from Ireland, and pre|&s;ented him to the king, from whom he met with a very gracious reception. But,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baker. Coke.</NOTE> he was of &s;uch a re&s;tle&s;s and turbulent &s;pirit, that he could not live in quiet; and after his return to his own country, he not only rai&s;ed a fre&s;h in&s;urrection, but even demanded &s;uccours from foreign powers. His efforts mi&s;carrying, he fled to the continent with the earl of Tyrconnel, whom he had engaged in his re|bellious practices; and pretended that the cruelties exerci&s;ed upon the pa|pi&s;ts of Ireland had compelled him to quit his country. James, in an&s;wer to this calumny, publi&s;hed an apology, to prove that he had treated the Roman catholics with great tenderne&s;s. In the beginning of this year, the archduke had &s;ent father Ney, provincial of the order of St. Francis, with propo&s;als of peace to the &s;tates of the United Provinces; and prince Maurice gave him to under&s;tand, that there could be no pacification, unle&s;s the king of Spain would acknowledge the provinces as a free and independent &s;tate. The eccle&s;ia&s;tic having &s;ignified this an&s;wer to the archduke, was di&s;patched a &s;econd time to Holland, with a writing &s;igned by Albert and the infanta, with which the &s;tates|general were &s;atisfied, on condition that it &s;hould be ratified at the court of Spain. Henry IV. of France being informed of this tran&s;action, &s;ent the pre|&s;ident

Jeanin, to offer his mediation to the &s;tates, which they forthwith accept|ed. But, in order to $word$ giving cau&s;e of jealou&s;y to James, they demanded his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and afterwards &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador to London, to make him acquainted with the &s;ituation of their affairs. When Philip's ra|tification arrived, it was found &s;o full of equivocal expre&s;&s;ions, that they were obliged to demand an explanation, in con&s;equence of which demand the nego|tiation was protracted; though, in the mean time, both &s;ides enjoyed the bene|fit<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> of a ce&s;&s;ation.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> The &s;ucceeding year was remarkable for little el&s;e than the execu|tion of two popi&s;h prie&s;ts, who refu&s;ed to take the oath of allegiance: the death of the earl of Dor&s;et, who was &s;ucceeded in his po&s;t of lord high trea&s;urer, by Cecil earl of Sali&s;bury: an exclu&s;ive privilege granted to a merchant for dre&s;&s;ing and dying broad-cloth, which had formerly been &s;ent to Holland for that pur|po&s;e: the king's monopolizing the &s;ale of alom, which had been lately di&s;|covered in England: a difference with the Dutch, who were forbidden to fi&s;h upon the coa&s;ts of Great Britain, until they engaged by treaty to pay a yearly $um for that privilege: and the enmity which archbi&s;hop Bancroft expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the puritans, a great number of whom re&s;olved to &s;ettle in Virginia, where they hoped to be out of the reach of per&s;ecution. Many families ac|tually embarked for that colony; and the re&s;t were prevented by a proclama|tion, forbidding them to quit the kingdom without an expre&s;s licence from the king, who began to fear this &s;ect would become too numerous and power|ful in America. James continued to indulge him&s;elf in his favourite diver&s;ion of hunting, and di&s;pen&s;ed his favours with &s;uch a prodigal hand, that he was expo&s;ed to all the mortifications of indigence. Indeed, &s;everal circum&s;tances concurred with his own lavi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition to involve him in manifold difficul|ties. The crown was indebted at his acce&s;&s;ion in a large &s;um, which Elizabeth had borrowed of the Londoners. That prince&s;s had alienated or mortgaged the crown-lands, in order to exempt her &s;ubjects from impo&s;itions. The increa&s;e of gold and &s;ilver in Europe, after the di&s;covery of the We&s;t-Indies, had not only introduced a more luxurious manner of living than that which had ob|tained in the reigns of his predece&s;&s;ors, but at the &s;ame time rai&s;ed the price of provi&s;ions and every other commodity: &s;o that, as his &s;ubjects became wealthy from commere, he became poor; for his revenue did not increa&s;e in proportion: the &s;ee-farm rents underwent no alteration; and the crown-lands were let in long lea&s;es, greatly under value.</P>

<P>Though James payed very little regard to the affairs or intere&s;t or the &s;tates-general, yet he did not fail to demand the payment of the debt which they owed to the crown of England, amounting to eight hundred and eighteen thou&s;and four hundred and eight pounds &s;terling. After &s;ome di&s;|putes, matters were adju&s;ted, and the plenipotentiaries of each nation &s;igned a defen&s;ive league, importing, That James &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in obtaining for the &s;tates a ju&s;t and honourable peace; and defend them with a certain number of &s;hips and forces, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be attacked. In return for the&s;e &s;tipula|tions, they entered into the like engagements for the &s;afety of him and his do|minions. In another treaty concluded at the &s;ame time, they acknowledged them&s;elves indebted to him for the &s;um already &s;pecified, and promi&s;ed to di&s;|charge it at the rate of thirty thou&s;and pounds payed half yearly; the fir&s;t pay|ment

<P>The&s;e treaties being ratified, the king of England &s;$nt Robert Spencer to the Hague, with powers to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the congre&s;s, in conjunction with Winwood his amba&s;&s;ador in ordinary. The king of Spain had ratified the archduke's declaration touching the independence of the &s;tates, only on condition, that the peace &s;hould take effect; and they refu&s;ed to treat on any other footing than that of a free &s;tate. They al&s;o received int$lligence, that Philip had endeavoured to detach the king of Great Britain from his in|tere&s;t, by means of Don Fernando de Gironne, who repaired to the court of London, in quality of amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary. This circum&s;tan$e was the more alarming, as James declared, upon all occa&s;ions, that he looked upon the Dutch as rebels; for, he did not believe that in any ca&s;e what&s;oever, &s;ubjects had a right to withdraw them&s;elves from the dominion of their &s;overeign. The&s;e being his &s;entiments, no wonder that his amba&s;&s;adors acted a very in|con&s;iderable part at the negotiation for a general peace. J$anin the French pre&s;ident directed the conferences; but, notwith&s;tanding his utmo&s;t $$forts, he could not obtain the con&s;ent of both parties to a pacification. Thus ba$$ed, he propo&s;ed a truce for twelve or fifteen years; and to this with difficulty they agreed. The king of Spain and the archduke, acknowledged the &s;tates, as a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

The&s;e advantages were not at all agreeable to the king of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grotius.</NOTE> England, who con&s;idered their &s;ucce&s;s as a precedent dangerous to the regal authority, of which he entertained &s;uch a &s;ublime idea, that, in the cour&s;e of this year, he granted a licence to print and publi&s;h two books, written in de|fence of the mo&s;t de&s;potic maxims. The fir&s;t compo&s;ed by one Cowel, a cler|gyman, maintained, that the king was not bound by the laws of the land, or by the oath which he took at his coronation. The author of the &s;econd was doctor Blackwood another eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who affirmed as a leading principle, that by the conque&s;t of William the Norman, the Engli&s;h had for&s;eited all their liberties. James under&s;tanding how much the people were offended by the&s;e performances, and hearing the parliament intended to make examples of the authors, anticipated their re&s;entment, by prohibiting the &s;ale of the books, and recalling the copies by proclamation.</P>

In order to conciliate their affections, he began with a&s;&s;uring them, that his maje&s;ty was re&s;olved to redre&s;s all their grievances; and, as a mark of his &s;ingular affection, would confer the order of knighthood upon his elde&s;t &s;on Henry prince of Wales, during the &s;e&s;&s;ion. He then proceeded to explain the cau&s;es of the king's indigence, ob&s;erving, that he had payed the debts of the late queen; that he had maintained an army of nineteen thou&s;and men in Ire|land; that he had expended great &s;ums in the funeral of Elizabeth, in his own journey, and that of his queen and children, from Edinburgh to London; in entertaining the king of Denmark, and the foreign amba&s;&s;adors; in main|taining
<PB N="166" REF="1680">
three &s;eparate courts for him&s;elf, his con&s;ort, and the prince of Wales; in &s;ending envoys to different courts on the continent; and in liberalities to his officers and dependants. He launched out into extravagant encomiums upon the king's wi&s;dom and probity; and declared that his maje$ty, far from intend|ing to rule de&s;potically, was ready at all times to hear the remon&s;trances of his parliament, provided they would confine them&s;elves within proper bounds, without deviating from that re&s;pect which was due to &s;uch a great and gra|cious &s;overeign. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, the members of the hou&s;e of commons loudly complained of the king's prodigality and exce&s;&s;ive profu&s;ion towards his own countrymen. Others ventured to affirm that his intention was to &s;ap the privileges of the &s;ubject by gradual u&s;urpation. He had been heard to declare at his own table, that the civil law of the Roman em|perors ought to be &s;ub&s;tituted in room of the common law of England; and approved of the treati&s;e called the Interpreter, written by Dr. Cowell on that &s;$bject; but the chief cau&s;e of their complaint was the high commi&s;&s;ion court, which had exerci&s;ed great &s;everities again&s;t the puritans, who&s;e party was e&s;pou&s;ed by a majority of the commons.</P>

<P>James, being informed of the&s;e proceedings, had recour&s;e to his own $loquence, which he thought irre&s;i&s;tible, and harangued the two hou&s;es at Whitehall. His &s;peech, however, was very ill calculated to &s;ooth the animo|&s;ity of his people. He told them that the prerogative of kings re&s;embled the divine power: that, as God could create or annihilate, make or unmake, accord|ing to his own will; &s;o kings could be&s;tow life or death, and judge all mankind without being &s;ubject to any earthly judicature. They could exalt the lowly, and aba&s;e the lofty: and, like per&s;ons playing at che&s;s, make a &s;imple pawn over|come a knight or bi&s;hop: neverthele&s;s, all kings, that were not tyrants, would confine them&s;elves to the laws they had enacted. He affirmed, that as it was held bla&s;ph$mous to di&s;pute what God may do, &s;o was it &s;editious in &s;ubjects to di&s;pute what a king might do in the height of his power. He a&s;&s;ured them of his attachment to the common law, provided it were reviewed and cor|rected. He de&s;ired they would not intermeddle with him on the exerci&s;e of government, which he called King-craft; for he had been thirty years at the trade in Scotland, and &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip in England; &s;o that there<NOTE PLACE="marg">W$$en.$</NOTE> needed no Phormios to teach Hannibal. Finally, he expatiated upon his own nece&s;&s;ities, and demanded a &s;upply; ob&s;erving that his reputation was now at &s;take among foreign princes; for, &s;hould his reque&s;t be refu&s;ed, the world would impute his di&s;appointment either to his own lack of merit or to their want of affection. The commons, though highly di&s;gu&s;ted at &s;ome of the maxims he had bro$ched, thought proper to di&s;&s;emble their re&s;entment, and expre&s;s a willingne&s;s to comply with the king's de&s;ires. The earl of Sali&s;bury moved for a conference with the commons, in order to obtain an adequate &s;upply for his maje&s;ty's pre&s;ent occa&s;ions, as well as a grant for two hundred thou&s;and pounds a year, for the future &s;upport of his royal dignity. The commons fired at this propo&s;al, and voted only one &s;ub&s;idy and one fifteenth, which did not amount to the &s;ixth part of what had been a&s;ked for the king's pre&s;ent occa&s;ions. They refu&s;ed to &s;ettle any &s;tanding revenue, unle&s;s the king would purcha&s;e it with &s;ome valuable con&s;ideration. They complained of re&s;|pites of homages, and con&s;ented to &s;ettle an annual revenue of two hundred
<PB N="167" REF="1690">
thou&s;and pounds, provided ward&s;hips &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, purveyances abo|li&s;hed, and &s;ome further privileges granted to the &s;ubject: but, they a&s;ter|wards ro&s;e in their demands, and in&s;i&s;ted upon the redre&s;s of their grievances. They complained of the king's pretending that his proclamations ought to have the force of laws; of the power arrogated by the high commi&s;&s;ion court; of his maje&s;ty's having altered the book of rates, and impo&s;ed new cu&s;toms on ce$tain &s;pecies of merchandi&s;e. They petitioned that no body &s;hould be forced to lend money to the king, or to give a rea&s;on for his refu&s;al; and, having received divers me&s;&s;ages, forbidding them to debate upon his right of laying impo&s;ts, they repre&s;ented that it was their fundamental right to debate freely upon all matters that concerned the &s;ubject. They afterwards pa&s;&s;ed a bill again&s;t taxes and impo&s;itions on merchants and merchandi&s;e; but it was thrown out of the hou&s;e of lords at the fir&s;t reading. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Winwood.</NOTE></P>

<P>James began to leave the admini&s;tration entirely in the hands of his mini&s;ters; and, while he indulged him&s;elf in hunting, payed very little at|tention to the affairs of the continent, when the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria endeavoured to aggrandize it&s;elf at the expence of its neighbours. The elector of Bran|denburg, and the duke of Neuberg, who were competitors for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the duke of Cleves, perceiving that the emperor Rodolphus II. intended to defraud them both of the inheritance, compromi&s;ed their difference; and im|plored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France and Holland. Henry IV. had already re&s;olved to humble the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and was glad of having this pretence for commencing ho&s;tilities. He promi&s;ed to lead his troops in per&s;on into the country of Cleves; and de&s;ired the &s;tates-general to &s;end thither prince Mau|rice with part of their forces: but, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e preparations, he was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by Ravillac, who &s;tabbed him as he alighted from his coach, in the very middle of his own capital. The murderer was a de&s;perate bigot, who had lately re&s;ided in Bru&s;&s;els, where his enthu&s;ia&s;m had been inflamed by the emi&s;&s;aries of Spain. As he had acted upon the maxim of the Je&s;uits, who looked upon Henry as an heretic in his heart, James was alarmed at an event which might affect his own pre&s;ervation: in order to &s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t a &s;et of men, who maintained &s;uch a dete&s;table doctrine, he publi&s;hed a procla|mation, commanding all Je&s;uits to quit the kingdom, and prohibiti$g all popi&s;h recu&s;ants from coming within ten miles of the court. Then he exacted the oath of allegiance from all his &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>Although the court of Spain was generally &s;u&s;pected of having effected the death of the French monarch, James di&s;covered a warm inclination

to be more clo&s;ely co$nected with Philip. Perhaps he thought it would be a prudent &s;tep to acquire the friend&s;hip of a power &s;o formidable to prote&s;tant princes. He therefore di&s;patched the lord Cornwall to Spain, with propo&s;als<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> of a match between the prince of Wales and the elde&s;t infanta. Richard Ban|cro&s;t, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, died about this period, after he had obtained a patent for founding a college at Chel&s;ea for the maintenance of able theologi&s;ts, to confute, in their &s;ermons and writings, the adver&s;aries of the Engli&s;h church, whether papi&s;ts or puritans. Bancro$t was &s;ucceeded in the metropolit$n &s;ee by George Abbot, who was of a character very different from that of his pre|dece&s;&s;or, and even accu&s;ed of being a puritan in his heart. When the parliament re-a&s;&s;embled, the king found the commons &s;till inau&s;picious, complaining, and inqui&s;itive; and therefore di&s;&s;olved them by proclamation, after they had &s;at &s;even years.

He was much more plea&s;ed with per&s;onal beauty than any other qualification; and the fir&s;t object that made an impre&s;&s;ion upon him was Robert Carr, a youth who had been his page in Scotland. Since that time he had travelled in France, and acquired &s;ome exterior accompli&s;hments, which &s;erved to &s;et off the beauty of his per&s;on. The lord Hay, looking upon him as a proper &s;ubject for the king's weakne&s;s, cau&s;ed him to be arrayed in the gaye&s;t apparel; and, at a pub|lic tilting match, inve&s;ted him with the office of pre&s;enting the buckler and de|vice to his maje&s;ty. Performing this &s;ervice, his hor&s;e, being unruly, flung him to the ground, and his leg was broke by the violence of the fall. James could not help taking particular notice of this accident: he was &s;truck with the beauty of Carr's per&s;on, as well as with the richne&s;s of his apparel, and gave order for his being lodged in the palace, where he vi&s;ited him after the tourna|ment. He found him extremely illiterate, and was charmed with his &s;impli|city; re&s;olving to mould this ductile clay according to his own fancy and in|c$ination. He now undertook the office of a pedagogue, for which indeed he &s;eemed to have been de&s;igned both by nature and education. He took infinite plea&s;ure in teaching him the rudiments of the Latin tongue. He created him knight and gentleman of his bedchamber. The earl of Dunbar, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a good &s;hare of the king's favour, dying at this juncture, Carr engro&s;&s;ed the whole without a rival, and &s;ucceeded that nobleman as trea&s;urer of Scotland.

<P>James, about this time, was rou&s;ed from his indolence by a theo|logical di&s;pute that happened in Holland between the di&s;ciples of Francis $o|marus and James Arminius, concerning ab&s;olute pred$&s;tination, and the in$|mi&s;&s;ibility of grace. Arminius dying, his place of profe&s;&s;or of theology in the univer&s;ity of Leyden was filled with Conrad Vor&s;tius, profe&s;&s;or at Steinfort, who had already publi&s;hed a treati&s;e intituled De Deo, which had drawn upon him the enmity of all the Gomarians. He publi&s;hed an apology; no$with|&s;tanding which they reviled him as a So$inian, and offered so demo$$$$ate damnable errors in both his performances. The king of England, having p$|ru&s;ed his treati&s;e and apology, was &s;o &s;hocked at his heretical opinions, that he forthwith &s;ent a li&s;t of them to Winwood his amba&s;&s;ador at the H$g$$$ with orders to declare to the &s;tates, that he was re&s;olved to publi&s;h $word$ m$ni$e&s;t$$ expre&s;&s;ing his dete&s;tation of tho&s;e errors, as well as of tho&s;e who permitted them to be circulated. In the mean time he ordered &s;ome copies of the treati&s;e and apology to be burned by the hands of the common hangman, at London, Oxford, and Cambridge. The &s;tates general, though not a little &s;hoeked at the in&s;olence of his interpo&s;ition, an&s;wered the amba&s;&s;ador's m$morial in a civil manner; yet, neverthele&s;s, Vor&s;tius was received in his profe&s;&s;or&s;hip. James wrote to them, declaring that &s;imple death was too gentle a puni&s;hment for &s;uch a wretch, whom if they were re&s;olved to tolerate, he would &s;eparate from the communion of Holland, and take &s;uch mea&s;ures that other churches &s;hould follow his example. The &s;tates, being unwilling to break with the king of England, told the amba&s;&s;ador, that they had ordered Vo$&s;tius to ab|&s;tain from the exerci&s;e of his office, until a new a&s;&s;embly could be convened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Winwood. Wil&s;on.</NOTE> in order to enquire into the affair. James, not yet &s;atisfied wi$h this an&s;wer, publi&s;hed a declaration, in which he treated the &s;tates of Holland with very little ceremony; and they, in order to avoid a quarrel, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Vor&s;tius from Leyden, though they procured another &s;ettlement for him at Goada. All this exertion in James, a prince of remarkable indolence, who had already treated tran&s;ub&s;tantiation and the number of the &s;acraments as &s;chola&s;tic que&s;tions, of little con&s;equence to &s;alvation, is not to be accounted for but from his vanity and &s;elf-conceit. He thought him&s;elf the mo&s;t able thoologi&s;t in the whole world; and, after he had &s;ignified his &s;entiments on this di&s;pute, he could not brook the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition. Perhaps too he was influenced by motives of re|&s;entment, again&s;t pen&s;ionary Barnevelt, the patron of Vor&s;tius, whom he hated as a rank republican.</P>

He began with pa&s;&s;ing an act of oblivion to quiet the minds of the people. He took them into his immediate protection, indulged them with the benefit of the Engli&s;h laws, and cau&s;ed ju&s;tice to be admini&s;tered with the utmo&s;t impartiality. Wicklow, Wexford, Tyrone, Tyrconnel, the northern parts of Ul&s;ter, half of Connaught, and all Mun&s;ter, were divided into counties, &s;upplied with &s;heriffs and ju&s;tices of the peace; and the judges made their circuits regularly twice a year. The lords and chieftains made &s;urrender of their lands to the crown; and, before they were regranted, all oppre&s;&s;ive exactions were aboli&s;hed. The Iri&s;h duties, rents, and &s;ervices, were valued and reduced to certain &s;ums of money, on

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1612.</NOTE> James now enjoyed him&s;elf in the mo&s;t profound tranquillity, which was &s;eldom invaded but by the difficulty he found in rai&s;ing money for his ordinary expence. He cau&s;ed his mother's body to be tran&s;ported from the church of Peterborough to We&s;tmin&s;ter, and depo&s;ited in the chapel founded by Henry VII. and, in the cour&s;e of this year, he had an opportunity to exhibit an agreeable &s;pecimen of impartiality in the execution of lord San|quar, a Scotti&s;h nobleman, who was convicted of having murdered a fencing|ma&s;ter. In vain did the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and &s;everal other noblemen intercede for this malefactor: James, perceiving how much the Engli&s;h nation was exa&s;perated at his partiality for his countrymen, prudently &s;acrificed him to their re&s;entment. In the month of October, Frederick V. elector palatine, arrived in England, in order to e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s Elizabeth; and was enter|tained with great magnificence: but, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e rejoicings, the nation was overwhelmed with &s;orrow, by the death of Henry prince of Wales, who, being &s;eized with an epidemic fever, expired on the twelfth day of No|vember,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co$$$. Wil$on.</NOTE> in the nineteenth year of his age. He is celebrated by hi&s;torians as one of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing princes that ever any country produced, and died univer&s;ally regretted by the people, not without &s;u&s;picion of poi&s;on, which was even imputed to the contrivance of his own father. But this &s;eems to be a groundle&s;s calumny, built upon &s;ome expre&s;&s;ion of the king, which argued him jealous of his &s;on's popularity, and afraid of his martial di&s;po&s;ition. Cer|tain it is, prince Henry de&s;pi&s;ed his father's pu&s;illanimity, and publicly di&s;|approved of his conduct; and James payed &s;o little deference to the memory of this excellent prince, that he would not even allow the courtiers to wear mourning. His death did not even interrupt the preparations for his daugh|ter's marriage; which, however, was deferred a few weeks, until Henry's funeral ob&s;equies could be performed.</P>

<P>The elector palatine, having been in&s;talled a knight of the garter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This he demanded and received, as an antient cu&s;tom ob&s;erved upon all &s;uch occa&s;ions. The elector remained in England about &s;ix weeks after his marriage; and all that time was &s;pent in fea&s;ts, balis, ma&s;querades, and other diver&s;ions. The city of London made a &s;uperb entertainment for the new-married couple, and pre&s;ented the electre&s;s with a pearl necklace of immen&s;e value. In the month of May James &s;u&s;tained another irreparable lo&s;s by the death of Cecil earl of Sali&s;bury, a &s;olid politician, who was perfectly acquainted with the genius of the people, and the affairs of the kingdom. His weight and &s;agacity &s;erved

as a counterpoi&s;e to the ra&s;hne&s;s and ignorance of the other mini&s;ters; and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the art of diverting the king in&s;en&s;ibly from the pur&s;uit of mea&s;ures that might have been attended with pernicious con&s;equences.

<P>The lord Roche&s;ter &s;till continued to engro&s;s the favour of his &s;o|vereign, and bore his good fortune with &s;uch equanimity and di&s;cretion as ren|dered him equally agreeable to the prince and people. He carefully avoided the lea&s;t appearance of partiality towards his own countrymen, and conducted him&s;elf according to the coun&s;els of Sir Thomas Overbury, a man of virtue, &s;agacity, and experience, who carefully directed him how to &s;hun tho&s;e rocks upon which &s;o many favourites had been &s;hipwrecked. But at length, all the wi&s;dom of the monitor proved in&s;ufficient to guard him again&s;t the allurements of a baneful pa&s;&s;ion that hurried him into ruin and di&s;grace. He became ena|moured of the counte&s;s of E&s;&s;ex, daughter to the earl of Suffolk, one of the mo&s;t beautiful young ladies in the kingdom. She had been married at the age of thirteen; and her hu&s;band, being likewi&s;e a minor, the con&s;ummation of the marriage was deferred until he &s;hould roturn from his travels. Mean while Roche&s;ter found means to make an impre&s;&s;ion upon her heart, and they gratified their mutual pa&s;&s;ion in &s;tolen interviews. The king him&s;elf was privy to this amour; for he delighted in acting the part of a confident in &s;uch inter|cour&s;e, as well as in li&s;tening to tales of ob&s;cenity, which his courtiers often invented for his entertainment. The return of E&s;&s;ex interrupted the enjoyment of the lovers: that nobleman, fired with the charms of his young con&s;ort, claimed the privilege of a hu&s;band with all the impatience of youthful ardour. She had conceived a dete&s;tation of E&s;&s;ex, which increa&s;ed in proportion to her affection for Roche&s;ter: &s;he treated him with indifference, coldne&s;&s;, and repul&s;e; and, by means of one Turner, a phy&s;ician's widow, had recour&s;e to a pretended magician of the name of Forman, who &s;upplied her with powders, which he &s;aid would render her hu&s;band impotent. Whatever means were u&s;ed, the earl found it impo&s;&s;ible to conver&s;e with his lady, who practi&s;ed &s;o many ex|traordinary methods to in&s;pire him with aver&s;ion and di&s;gu&s;t, that &s;he at length &s;ucceeded in her endeavours. He began to think &s;he was different from all the other individuals of her &s;ex, and the extravagant &s;orrow &s;he affected to di&s;|play, per&s;uaded him that her heart was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome more favoured lover. On the&s;e con&s;iderations he neglected her in his turn; and when he di&s;|covered the intercour&s;e between her and Roche&s;ter, which became every day more and more notorious, he relinqui&s;hed her intirely, as an abandoned woman unworthy of his affection.</P>

<P>The counte&s;s, not &s;atisfied with being the mi&s;tre&s;s, eagerly wi&s;hed to be the wife of Roche&s;ter, to whom &s;he communicated her &s;entiments on this &s;ubject; not doubting but that, by his influence with the king, &s;he could pro|cure a divorce from her hu&s;band. When Roche&s;ter imparted this &s;cheme to Sir Thomas Overbury, that faithful coun&s;ellor argued with great vehemence again&s;t &s;uch an expedient, which he &s;aid would be attended with infamy and di&s;grace. The counte&s;s, being appri&s;ed of his oppo&s;ition, marked him out as a &s;acrifice to her re&s;entment; and, as the favourite was by this time infatuated by her charms, engaged him in a plan for the de&s;truction of Overbury. He
<PB N="172" REF="1740">
told the king that Sir Thomas was become in&s;olent and unruly; and de&s;ired he might be lent amba&s;&s;ador to Mu&s;covy. Then he per&s;uaded Overbury to refu&s;e the office, a&s;&s;uring him he would obtain &s;omething more advantageous as &s;oon as the king's re&s;entment &s;hould be blown over. The unhappy victim, tru&s;ting to the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, declined accepting the office which the king propo&s;ed; and Roche&s;ter expatiating on his refu&s;al as a mark of in&s;olence and di&s;re&s;pect to his maje&s;ty, an order was granted for committing him pri&s;oner to the Tower, the lieutenancy of which had been lately be&s;towed upon Sir Gerva&s;e Elwaies, one of the favourite's creatures. The trouble&s;ome coun&s;ellor being thus removed and &s;eque&s;tred from all intercour&s;e with his friends and acquaintance, the earl of Northampton, uncle to the counte&s;s, &s;ollicited the king in behalf of his niece, who demanded a divorce on account of her hu&s;band's impotence. James, plea|&s;ed with an opportunity to oblige his favourite, granted a commi&s;&s;ion under the great &s;eal to the bi&s;hops and judges, impowering them to hear and deter|mine the affair. A jury of matrons was impanelled to in&s;pect the counte&s;s, and they reported her a virgin. In confideration of her mode&s;ty &s;he obtained permi&s;&s;ion to appear before them in a veil, and is &s;aid to have &s;ub&s;tituted in her place a young woman of her own &s;hape and &s;tature. The earl of E&s;&s;ex, being examined by the commi&s;&s;ioners, declared that he had never performed the rites of matrimony; nor did he believe he &s;hould ever be able to conver&s;e with her as a wife, though he did not find the &s;ame difficulties with other women. The report of the matrons, corroborated by this confe&s;&s;ion, induced the judges to declare the marriage a nullity. Bil&s;on bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter having &s;trenu|ou&s;ly contended for this di&s;&s;olution, his &s;on was knighted by the intere&s;t of Ro|che&s;ter, and ever after di&s;tingui&s;hed in deri&s;ion by the name of Sir Nullity Bil&s;on.</P>

<P>In a few weeks after this deci&s;ion, the favourite was created earl of Somer&s;et, and his marriage with the counte&s;s &s;olemnized in the mo&s;t o&s;ten|tatious manner. Nothing was now wanting to their triumph but the death of Overbury, without which that implacable woman could not be &s;atisfied. They had already practi&s;ed upon his life with &s;low poi&s;on, admini&s;tered by one We&s;|$on, recommended by Mrs. Turner as a proper in&s;trument for this pur|po&s;e: he attended the pri&s;oner as a dome&s;tic, and the poi&s;on was compounded by another mi&s;creant called Franklin, an apothecary. Overbury, finding his health con&s;iderably impaired, and gue&s;&s;ing the cau&s;e of his indi&s;po&s;ition, wrote a pathetic letter to Somer&s;et, imploring his mediation with the king, that he might be re&s;tored to liberty; and the earl a&s;&s;ured him, that in a few days he &s;hould be relea&s;ed from his confinement. The accomplices redoubled their efforts, but the effects of what they admini&s;tered proving le&s;s violent than they had expected, We&s;ton and Franklin are &s;aid to have &s;tifled him with the bed-cloaths. He was immediately interred, on pretence that the &s;mell of the body was intolerably offen&s;ive; and the earl of Northampton, in a letter to Somer&s;et, intimating his decea&s;e, declared that he died of the venereal di&s;tem|per,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> which had proceeded to &s;uch a degree of inveteracy, that his whole body was covered with loath&s;ome ulcers. The&s;e, in fact, were the efforts of a vi|gorous con&s;titution, to di&s;charge the poi&s;on which this unfortunate gentleman had received.</P>

<P>Northampton was privy to every circum&s;tance of this barbarous<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1614.</NOTE> a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and &s;ucceeded Overbury as the coun&s;ellor of Somer&s;et. He was a Roman catholic in his heart, and being warden of the Cinque Ports, per&s;ons of that religion were admitted into the kingdom without examination; &s;o that England was in a little time filled with popi&s;h prie&s;ts and je&s;uits. The people began to murmur; and the earl of Northampton being accu&s;ed as the cau&s;e of this grievance, pro&s;ecuted &s;everal per&s;ons on the writ of Scandalum Magnatum. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e pro&s;ecutions the archbi&s;hop produced a letter, written by the earl to cardinal Bellarmine, declaring him&s;elf a zealous catholic, wholly devoted to the &s;ee of Rome. The king reproached him bitterly for this in|&s;tance of his di&s;&s;imulation, and he retired to his country-hou&s;e, where, in a few weeks, he died a profe&s;&s;ed papi&s;t. The Roman catholics, however, did not &s;u&s;tain &s;o many mortifications as were devi&s;ed again&s;t the pre&s;byterians, great numbers of whom quitted their native country, and &s;ettled in New-England, which &s;oon became a flouri&s;hing colony; though they were not permitted to depart from Britain until they had given &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for their good behaviour.</P>

<P>James was of &s;uch a profu$e di&s;po&s;ition, that no revenue could have been &s;ufficient to exempt him from want and indigence <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Being one day in the gallery at Whitehall, attended by Sir Henry Rich and James Maxwell, &s;ome porters happened to pa&s;s, loaded with money for the privy pur&s;e. The king, perceiving Rich whi&s;pering to Maxwell, in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing what he had &s;aid; and being told that he ex|pre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h that he had &s;o much money, he ordered the porters to carry the whole &s;um, amounting to three thou&s;and pounds, to his lodgings; &s;aying, he $ad more plea&s;ure in giving, than the other could po&s;&s;ibly have in receiving his bounty. <BIBL>Wil&s;on.</BIBL></NOTE>; therefore his mini&s;ter's whole attention was employed in devi&s;ing means for rai&s;ing money without the &s;anction of parliament. He now had recour&s;e to a &s;cheme formed by the late earl of Sali&s;bury; namely, the creation of baronets, a &s;pecies of nobility between a baron and a knight, to de&s;cend as an hereditary title. One hundred were inve&s;ted with this new dignity, by patents, obliging them to main|tain a certain number of &s;oldiers in Ireland: but this &s;ervice was commuted for a &s;um of money. The king had recour&s;e to other expedients for filling his empty coffers: he &s;old monopolies, revived the antient cu&s;tom, by which every per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing forty pounds a year in land was obliged to receive the order of knighthood; and compounded with tho&s;e who de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from an honour which they could not maintain. He created a certain number of knights of Nova Scotia, who likewi&s;e purcha&s;ed this di&s;tinction. The titles of earl, vi&s;count, and baron, were &s;et to &s;ale at different prices, in the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Tho&s;e who had defective titles were obliged to pay for a confirmation, and the Star-Chamber impo&s;ed exce&s;&s;ive fines for the u&s;e of his maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>Even all the&s;e channels were unable to &s;upply the wa&s;te of the king's prodigality; &s;o that the favourite and his &s;on-in-law the earl of Suffolk per&s;uaded him to convoke a new parliament, with a&s;&s;urances that they would take care to return a majority of the commons, that &s;hould be at his devotion. This promi&s;e, however, they were not able to perform. The parliament meeting on the fir&s;t day of April, the king demanded an aid on account of his
<PB N="174" REF="1760">
daughter's marriage, giving them to under&s;tand, that they &s;hould be afterwards allowed to examine into the gri$vances of the nation. In&s;tead of complying with his reque&s;t, they began by enquiring in what manner the crown-revenues had been expended; and found that his maje&s;ty had made exce&s;&s;ive donations to his own countrymen, not only in money, but in lands, which they had &s;old to the Eng$$&s;$, remitting the money to Scotland, an in&s;atiable gulph, from which it never returned. Then they examined into the cau&s;e of the &s;urpri&s;ing increa&s;e of popi&s;h recu&s;ants, which they imputed, fir&s;t, to the king's admitting popi&s;h lords into his council; and, &s;econdly, to the negotiations which had been &s;et $n foot for the marriage of the king's &s;ons with the daughters of popi&s;h princes. They next deliberated upon the monopolies which were prejudicial to commerce; and the extraordinary means which had been u&s;ed to rai&s;e money without the intervention of parliament: finally, they re&s;olved to pre&s;ent an addre&s;s, be&s;eeching his maje&s;ty to redre&s;s the&s;e grievances; and, in particular to h$nder his Scotti&s;h &s;ubjects from making any future &s;ettlements in England. James was &s;o incen&s;ed at their rough manner of proceeding, that he di&s;&s;olved the parliament before it had enacted one &s;tatute; and ordered &s;ome of the members to be impri&s;oned, for having &s;poken too freely of him and his prerogative.</P>

<P>The parliament having proved &s;o unpropitious, the court could devi&s;e no other fea&s;ible &s;cheme for relieving the king in his nece&s;&s;ity, but that of a Benevolence, which was immediately put in execution. All the &s;heriffs of the kingdom were ordered by an act of council to levy a &s;um under this title, from the individuals of their different di&s;tricts; and to &s;end up to court a li&s;t of tho&s;e who &s;hould either refu&s;e to contribute, or be&s;tow a pre&s;en$ in|adequate<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cole.

<P>The earl of Somer&s;et po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the king's affection &s;o intirely, that the queen is &s;aid to have become jealous of this favourite. Whether this was the real cau&s;e of her aver&s;ion, or &s;he &s;u&s;pected him of having been con|cerned in the death of her elde&s;t &s;on prince Henry, &s;he certainly hated him with an uncommon degree of rancour, and re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to effect his ruin. For this purpo&s;e &s;he intere&s;ted in her re&s;entment Sir Ralph Winwood, who enjoyed the title of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, though all the functions of the of|fice were performed by the expre&s;s direction of Somer&s;et. The king, in his winter's progre&s;s, pa&s;&s;ing through Cambridge, was entertained by the &s;tudents with a comedy intitled Ignoramus, compo&s;ed with a view to ridicule the common law and lawyers of England; a &s;ubject extremely agreeable to James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$$$n. 1$13.</NOTE> who dete&s;ted all laws which the people had any hand in framing. The earls of Pembroke, Bedford, and &s;ome other noblemen, who were enemies to So|mer&s;et, either pre&s;uming upon the king's levity of di&s;po&s;ition, or perceiving &s;ome marks of abatement in his affection for that favourite, determined to
<PB N="175" REF="1770">
di&s;play a new lure for his fancy; and for this purpo&s;e pitched upon George Villiers, &s;econd &s;on of Sir Edward Villiers, a gentleman of Leice&s;ter&s;hire. George was ju&s;t turned of twenty, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all tho&s;e exterior graces by which the weak mind of James was &s;o liable to be captivated. He had lately returned from France, with all the per&s;onal accompli&s;hments which could be acquired in that country; and being gorgeou&s;ly apparelled for the purpo&s;e, was placed at the comedy, in &s;uch a manner that he could not fail to attract the king's notice. James no &s;ooner beheld this gaudy figure, than he exhibited marks of admiration; and retained him in the court as one of his cup$bearers.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="38" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Somer&s;et was too jealous of his influence to look upon this new comer with unconcern. By his office of chamberlain he exerci&s;ed autho|rity over all the cup-bearers, and &s;ubjected Villiers to continual mortifications. Neverthele&s;s, that young competitor deprived him every day of a new &s;hare of the king's favour. The enemies of Somer&s;et nur&s;ed the king's growing inclination for Villiers with extravagant encomiums upon the beauty, virtue, and accompli&s;hments of this minion. Somer&s;et was like a mi&s;tre&s;s in the wane of her charms: the king was cloyed with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He began to be di&s;gu&s;ted with the change in this nobleman's appearance and di&s;po&s;ition. Since his marriage he was become melancholy, and &s;eemed to feel the poignant &s;tings of con&s;cience: he neglected the ornaments of his per&s;on: his vivacity vani&s;hed: he no longer mingled in the fooleries that were daily practi&s;ed in the king's anti-chamber; and he began to exhibit marks of avarice, than which nothing was more de&s;picable in the eyes of his &s;overeign. James had declared that he would have no favourite but &s;uch as &s;hould be recommended by the queen: that in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould complain of him in the &s;equel, he might have it in his power to &s;ay he had favoured him at her own expre&s;s de&s;ire. Abbot archbi&s;hop of Canterbury be&s;ought her to recommend Villiers; and at fir&s;t &s;he flatly refu&s;ed to comply with his reque&s;t, ob&s;erving, that &s;hould he be received on the footing of a favourite, the king would &s;oon teach him to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who recommended him, that he might be the more attached to his maje&s;ty's own per&s;on: but, by dint of importunity, &s;he was at length prevailed upon to u&s;e her influence with the king in his behalf. James, charmed with her reque&s;t, immediately knighted Villiers, and appointed him one of the gentlemen of his chamber.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The court was immediately divided between the two favourites. Though the king &s;till affected to treat Somer&s;et with marks of particular con&s;ideration, every body perceived a con&s;traint in this complacency; and Vil|liers, by his affability, deprived his rival every day of &s;ome con&s;iderable ad|$erent. Somer&s;et perceiving his progre&s;s, thought it high time to &s;creen him|&s;elf from the machinations of his enemies; and, throwing him&s;elf at the king's feet, &s;upplicated a general pardon, that his foes might not be able to tak$ ad|vantage of any error or offence he might have committed during his admini|&s;tration, through frailty or ignorance. James forthwith granted his reque&s;t, and ordering an ample pardon to be expedited, &s;igned it with his own hand. But the chancellor refu&s;ed to give it the &s;anction of the great &s;eal, alledging that it was a pardon not only for all the trea&s;ons, felonies, and murders, which Somer&s;et might have already committed, but al&s;o for all tho&s;e of which he
<PB N="1$$" REF="1780">
might be guilty in the &s;equel. Another pardon couched in proper ter$s might have been ea&s;ily drawn up; but whether the queen oppo&s;ed it, or the earl of Somer&s;$t thought it impolitic to give the world any further rea&s;on believe he &s;tood in need of &s;uch an amne&s;$y, no &s;uch pardon was ever ob|tained.</P>

<P>Upon the king's return to Roy&s;ton from his &s;ummer-progre&s;s, the t$ain was laid for the de&s;truction of this favourite. The apothecary's &s;er|$$nt who had compounded a poi&s;onous cly&s;ter for the unhappy Overbury, having ret$red to the Low-Countries, di&s;covered this and other circum&s;tances to Trumbull the king's envoy at Bru&s;&s;els, who communicated this intelli|gence to Sir Ralph Winwood; and the king being made acquainted with the whole affair, commanded them both to keep it &s;ecret, until they &s;hould re|cerve further orders. In all probability he would have let it re&s;t in oblivion, had not Somer&s;et's indi&s;cretion compelled him to take other mea&s;ures. The peace of his court was now every day invaded by the quarrels and di&s;putes of the two favourites and their dependants. He expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that they &s;hould live together on terms of friend&s;hip. He ordered Villiers to &s;ollicit Somer&s;$t's protection. The young knight accordingly vi&s;ited the earl at his own hou&s;e, where he told him he was come to de&s;ire he might be admitted into the number of his humble &s;ervants, prote&s;ting that he would &s;erve him with the ut|mo&s;t fidelity, and depend upon him for his fortune and preferment. Somer|&s;$t rejected all his advances, telling him he had no &s;ervice for him; and that he would break his neck, &s;hould he ever find an opportunity of &s;o doing.</P>

<P>The king was extremely incen&s;ed at this brutal reply, and from that moment de&s;tined Somer&s;et to infamy and ruin. While he re&s;ided at Roy|$ton, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to lord chief ju&s;tice Coke, with a letter, de&s;iring him to i&s;&s;ue warrants for apprehending the earl of Somer&s;et and his counte&s;s, Sir Gerva&s;e Elwaies lieutenant of the Tower, Mrs. Turner, We&s;ton, and Francklin, the accomplices in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury. When the officer came to &s;erve the warrant upon the earl at Roy&s;ton, he found him on the point of &s;etting out for London: the king hung about his neck, a&s;$|ing, in the mo&s;t affectionate tone, when he &s;hould &s;ee him again. Somer&s;et being made acquainted with the purport of the warrant, exclaimed in a furious &s;train again&s;t the in&s;olence of the officer who pre&s;umed to arre&s;t a peer of the realm in the king's pre&s;ence; but James being informed of the tran&s;action, &s;aid, with a &s;mile, "Nay, nay, you mu&s;t go; for if Coke &s;hould &s;end for me, I mu&s;t comply." Then he accompanied him to the &s;tair-ca&s;e, embraced him at part|ing, begging he would return immediately, in as much as he could not live without his company. Yet he had no &s;ooner turned his back, than he ex|claimed, "Go, and the devil go with thee: I &s;hall never &s;ee thy face again." Som$r&s;$t and his counte&s;s were committed to the Tower, and all the other accomplices to different pri&s;ons; and next day judge Coke repairing to Roy|&s;ton, the king commanded him to examine the affair with the utmo&s;t impar|tiality, wi&s;hing that the cur&s;e of God might fall upon him and his family $hould he &s;pare the guilty; and imprecating the &s;ame malediction upon him|&s;elf and his po&s;terity, in ca&s;e he &s;hould pardon any of tho&s;e whom the law &s;hould condemn.</P>

The pa&s;&s;ion of love, which had prompted this couple to act &s;uch an execrable tragedy, was &s;oon converted to mutual di&s;gu&s;t and implacable hatred.

<P>After the fall of Somer&s;et, the favour of James was wholly con|centrated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1616$</NOTE> upon the youthful Villiers, who &s;hone forth in meridian lu&s;tre, and conciliated the affections of all the courtiers by his engaging manners and in|&s;inuating addre&s;s: but the fir&s;t exertion of his influence was in filling all the places about court with his own creatures; &s;o that the dependants of the old mini&s;ter were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed of cour&s;e. It was in the beginning of this mini&s;try that lord chief ju&s;tice Coke was dive&s;ted of his office, on pretence of &s;ome trivial mi&s;demeanours, though the real cau&s;e of his di&s;grace was his oppo&s;ing the king, in be&s;towing a vacant bi&s;hopric in commendam. His place was filled by Montague; and the lord chancellor Elle&s;mere being &s;eized with a dangerous illne&s;s, re&s;igned the &s;eals into the hands of his maje&s;ty. He kept them till the death of Elle&s;mere, and then they were given to Bacon, who was afterwards promoted to the dignity of chancellor. He was an ablelawyer, and an excellent philo&s;pher; but abject, irre&s;olute, and of an unguarded di&s;po&s;ition, which was practi&s;ed upon to the prejudice of his character. In the cour&s;e of this year, the king's only &s;urviving &s;on Charles was created prince of Wales; and the king vehemently wi&s;hed to &s;ee him married: but as no pro|te&s;tant king had a marriageable daughter, and James thought he &s;hould de|grade his dignity in matching him with a lady of inferior rank, he turned his eyes upon two catholic prince&s;&s;es; namely, Anne of Au&s;tria, who married Lewis XIII. of France, and the infanta Maria, daughter of Philip III. king of Spain.</P>

<P>The marriage of the French monarch was already determined; &s;o that his whole attention was diverted into other channels. He &s;ent the lord Hay amba&s;&s;ador to France, and the lord Ro&s;s into Spain, with compliments

of congratulation to the two monarchs, upon the nuptials of Lewis and Anne; and they were in&s;tructed to &s;ound the inclinations of the two kings touching the marriage of the prince of Wales with the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter of Lewis, or with the infanta Maria. The French lady was already betrothed to the prince of Piedmont: but the other &s;cheme afforded a more agreeable pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. The duke of Lerma, Philip's prime mini&s;ter, had already made an overture concerning the match, to Digby the Engli&s;h envoy at Madrid; and the count de Gondemar, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at London, was em|powered to treat with the king on this &s;ubject. This was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;tratagem of the court of Spain, to interrupt the good under&s;tanding that &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between the Engli&s;h and Dutch; and Charleton, the king's amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, gave his ma&s;ter to under&s;tand, that the Spaniards had for this purpo&s;e circulated a report that the negotiation for the marriage was far ad|vanced. In effect, Philip's aim was to amu&s;e James with this treaty, in &s;uch a manner that he &s;hould not join again&s;t him in the war of Cleves; but, in the &s;equel he was influenced by a more important motive. The vanity of the Engli&s;h monarch was &s;o agreeably flattered with the pro&s;pect of this alliance, that he could not help manife&s;ting the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s to &s;ee it brought to perfection; and Gondemar, who was perfectly well acquainted with his di&s;|po&s;ition, managed this de&s;ire to &s;uch advantage, that for &s;everal years James acted in every thing according to his direction, rather than run the ri&s;que of &s;eeing the match fru&s;trated, by giving offence to the court of Spain.</P>

<P>Such were the politics of that prince, who was denominated the Solomon of the age. He &s;aw without emotion the efforts of the court of France in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the prote&s;tants of that kingdom: he beheld with un|concern the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria forming projects for en&s;laving all Europe; and, on pretence of indulging his people with the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, he neglected every political concern of the nation. Nor did his conduct at home redound more to the credit of his di&s;cretion. He &s;quandered away immen&s;e &s;ums, and alienated almo&s;t all the crown-lands, to enrich a few worthle&s;s favourites. The earl of Somer&s;et had, in five years, ama&s;&s;ed two hundred thou&s;and pounds in money, jewels, and plate; be&s;ides eighteen thou&s;and pounds a year in landed e&s;tate. The earl of Salisbury, though a younger brother, had left a large fortune. Northampton had built an expen&s;ive palace in London, &s;ince known by the name of Northumberland-hou&s;e; and bequeathed a great inheritance to his nephew the earl of Arundel. Suffolk, another brother of the duke of Norfolk, had expended two hundred thou&s;and pounds in one edifice in the country. The duke of Lennox, the earl of Dunbar, and lord Hay, had re|mitted<NOTE PLACE="marg">W$$&s;on.

<P>All the &s;ources of this profu&s;ion were now dried up, and the king was bent upon enriching his new favourite. The &s;tates of Holland know|ing his &s;ituation, and afraid of their cautionary towns, which he might be pre|vailed upon to deliver into the hands of Spain, in order to promote his &s;on's marriage, &s;eized this opportunity to reobtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e places; and, at the &s;ame time, compound for the debt which they owed to the crown of Eng|land. They began by abating their punctuality in paying the Engli&s;h garri|&s;ons; and the&s;e complained to the king, who was in no condition to provide
<PB N="179" REF="1810">
for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. When he &s;ent remon&s;trances to the &s;tates on this &s;ubject, they expatiated upon the bad &s;ituation of their affairs, occa&s;ioned by the va&s;t expences of the war. Caron, their envoy in England, in&s;inuated to the mi|ni&s;try, that if the king would con&s;ent to re&s;tore the cautionary towns, he be|lieved the &s;tates would endeavour to rai&s;e money by borrowing at high intere&s;t, in order to &s;atisfy him with re&s;pect to the debt they owed. This was a tempta|tion which James and his courtiers could not with&s;tand. He forthwith wrote to the &s;tates on this &s;ubject; the pen&s;ionary Barnevelt was &s;ent over to manage the negotiatiation at the court of London, where he acted his part with &s;uch dexterity, that James accepted of one third of the &s;um which was due; and delivered up the cautionary towns which had been pledged to queen Eli|zabeth.</P>

<P>This money no &s;ooner appeared than it vani&s;hed in an unaccount|able manner. The king payed no creditor; the fleet was ruined for want of repair; and not one farthing was &s;ent to the troops in Ireland, which for &s;eve|ral years had received no regular &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The earl of Suffolk lord trea|&s;urer had embezzled a con&s;iderable part of the &s;upply; and Villiers the new favourite would not let &s;lip this opportunity of ruining th&eacute; father-in-law of Somer&s;et. He was accu&s;ed in the Star-chamber of divers malver&s;ations in the exerci&s;e of his office; and being found guilty, condemned to pay a fine of thirty thou&s;and pounds, and be impri&s;oned during the king's plea&s;ure. The office of trea&s;urer was put in commi&s;&s;ion; and &s;ecretary Winwood dying about the &s;ame time, his place was divided between Naunton and Calvert, the fir&s;t of whom was a prote&s;tant, and the other a papi&s;t. Villiers was by this time created vi&s;|count of Waddon, and earl of Buckingham: he was afterwards rai&s;ed to the titles of marquis and duke of Buckingham, in&s;talled knight of the garter, ap|pointed ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, chief ju&s;tice in Eyre, warden of the Cinque-ports, &s;teward of We&s;tmin&s;ter, con&s;table of Wind&s;or, and lord high admiral of Eng|land. In the beginning of the &s;ucceeding year, Marc Antonio de Dominis, archbi&s;hop of Spalato in Dalmatia, arrived in England as a convert to the pro|te&s;tant religion. He preached and wrote again&s;t the doctrines of the Roman<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1617.</NOTE> church; and was appointed dean of Wind&s;or, and ma&s;ter of the Savoy. After having re&s;ided &s;ome years in England, he was &s;educed by count Gondemar, with the promi&s;e of a cardinal's hat, to go and make a public recantation at Rome. He accordingly went to Rome, and abjured the prote&s;tant religion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wil&s;on.</NOTE> but, in&s;tead of being promoted, he was confined in a dungeon of the inqui&s;i|tion, where he died; and his body was burned in public.</P>

<P>James, from his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of England, had formed the &s;cheme of reducing the Scotti&s;h clergy to a conformity with the Engli&s;h church. He had &s;ent the following articles to be in&s;erted in their canons: That they &s;hould receive the communion kneeling: That the &s;acrament &s;hould be admini&s;tered in private to &s;ick per&s;ons: That they &s;hould keep the fe&s;tivals of Chri&s;tmas, Ea&s;ter, A&s;cen&s;ion, and Whit&s;untide: and, That children at a cer|tain age &s;hould be confirmed by the bi&s;hops. The&s;e articles being rejected by the general a&s;&s;embly, as the preliminaries of more important alterations, the king was incen&s;ed at their ob&s;tinacy; and re&s;olved to vi&s;it his Scotti&s;h dominions, that he might in per&s;on compel them to obedience. The Scotti&s;h bi&s;hops re|tained nothing but the name of that dignity; for, the whole eccle&s;ia&s;tical power was lodged in the general a&s;&s;embly of the mini&s;ters. James was bent upon re&s;tor|ing
<PB N="180" REF="1820">
epi&s;copacy to its former lu$tre and authority; but, he did not con&s;ider, that the revenues which had maintained that &s;plendor, aro&s;e from e&s;tates which were $ow po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by lay nobleman, who would not ea&s;ily part with their acqui&s;i|tions. Be&s;ides, the people in general were puritanical, and the &s;pirit of $word$ prevailed over the whole nation. The king, before his departure from London, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, importing his de&s;ign of vi&s;iting his antient king|dom, that he might reform certain abu&s;es which had crept into the church and &s;tate of that country. Then he &s;ent &s;ome officers of his hou&s;hold to Edinburgh, directing them to adorn his chapel with pictures and &s;tatues, which gave great offence to his Scotti&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>He him&s;elf opened the parliament of Scotland with a long ha|rangue, in which he recommended the e&s;tabli&s;hment of regular civil polity, the abolition of all barbarous cu&s;toms, promi&s;ed to protect the innocent, and threatened to puni&s;h the guilty. He de&s;ired they would appoint commi&s;&s;ioners to regulate the affairs of religion; and the parliament a&s;&s;enting to his propo&s;al, he him&s;elf nominated them from the number of his own creatures. He in&s;i&s;ted upon their e&s;tabli&s;hing the following article, That every thing ordained by the king and his bi&s;hops, touching the exterior government of the church, &s;hould have the force of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical law, to which every per&s;on &s;hould &s;ubmit. The mini&s;ters immediately took the alarm, prote&s;ting again&s;t this article; and the whole nation was in a ferment. James, di&s;concerted by this oppo&s;ition, de&s;ired the clergy would attend him at St. Andrew's, where he told them he was deter|mined to be obeyed; and they, intimidated by his menaces, be&s;ought him to convoke a general a&s;&s;embly, that his propo&s;als might be unanimou&s;ly accepted. With great reluctance he con&s;ented to this expedient. In the mean time, Simp&s;on, who had drawn up and &s;igned the prote&s;t, was impri&s;oned; and Catherwood, who had di&s;per&s;ed copies of it, was bani&s;hed the kingdom. After James had &s;et out on his return to England, the general a&s;&s;embly meeting at St. Andrew's, re&s;olved to delay their acceptation of the four articles, until all the churches of the kingdom could be informed of the affair; and then the &s;e&s;&s;ion broke up. The king, exa&s;perated at this contempt of his authority, ordered all their &s;tipends to be arre&s;ted; but, finding this mea&s;ure &s;erved only to irritate the minds of his Scotti&s;h &s;ubjects, he allowed them to hold another a&s;&s;embly at Perth, where they were at length prevailed upon to receive his four articles; though this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spo$ti&s;wood.</NOTE> impo&s;ition &s;owed the &s;eeds of tho&s;e troubles which afterwards ruined his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>

<P>During the king's journey from Scotland to London, he was pre&s;ented with a petition by a great number of pea&s;ants, trade&s;men, and &s;ervants, re|que&s;ting, that they might as u&s;ual be allowed to take their diver&s;ions on Sun|days, after divine &s;ervice. James being per&s;uaded, that tho&s;e were puritans who forbade &s;uch diver&s;ions; and that they were jewi&s;hly inclined, becau&s;e they affected to call Sunday the Sabbath, re&s;olved to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the vulgar in the privilege which they had lo&s;t. He publi&s;hed a performance, intituled, The book of Sports, recommending all diverting exerci&s;es after &s;ermon. He ordered it to be read publicly in all churches; and &s;uch mini&s;ters as refu&s;ed to obey this injunction, were &s;everely puni&s;hed by the court of high com|mi&s;&s;ion. Whatever his motives might have been for enforcing this practice, it was not a bad pre&s;ervative again&s;t the de&s;perate effects of gloomy fanatici&s;m, which had already taken full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one kingdom, and made con&s;idera|ble progre&s;s in the other.</P>

<P>This year was rendered remarkable for the la&s;t expedition of Sir Walter Raleigh, which produced loud murmurs again&s;t the government. Though he was odious to the nation when the king committed him to the Tower, the hatred of the people was &s;oftened by his long confinement; and their admiration excited by the &s;urpri&s;ing vigour of his faculties, manife&s;ted in his hi&s;tory of the world, which had been lately publi&s;hed; a work compo&s;ed in pri&s;on, where he laboured under every &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s that could di&s;pirit or di&s;concert the human mind. At length, he was relea&s;ed, though without a pardon; and his e&s;tate having been forfeited, he formed a &s;cheme for acquir|ing a new fortune in America. He gave the king to under&s;tand, that he had, in the cour&s;e of his former expeditions, found a rich gold mine in Guiana, which was uninhabited by any European nation; and he obtained a commi&s;&s;ion, im|powering him to make a &s;ettlement on the place. Several wealthy adventu|rers engaged in this project, for the purpo&s;es of which twelve ve&s;&s;els were equip|ped; and he took his departure from England in the month of Augu&s;t. When he arrived at the mouth of the river Oroonoko, he detatched five ve&s;&s;els, un|der the command of his &s;on, and captain Keymis, to &s;ail up the &s;tream in que&s;t of the mine; and they making a de&s;cent near a &s;mall town called St. Thomas, lately built by the Spaniards, met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition$ in &s;pite of which, they took and plundered the place, though young Raleigh was killed in the action. No mine, however, could they find, nor the lea&s;t appearance of ore. Raleigh, chagrined at the lo&s;s of his &s;on, and their failure in &s;earch of the gold, which alone could reconcile the king to the ho&s;tilities they had committed again&s;t the Spaniards, is &s;aid to have threatened Keymis with his maje&s;ty's indignation, for having fir&s;t deceived Raleigh in his de&s;cription of the mine, and afterwards attacked the Spaniards without his order. Keymis, in order to avoid public puni&s;hment and di&s;grace, made away with him&s;elf. A grievous mortality pre|vailed among the people: the &s;ailors loudly exclaimed, that they had been &s;a|crificed to a chimerical project, and compelled Raleigh to &s;et &s;ail for England. He was obliged by contrary winds to put in at Kin&s;ale in Ireland, where he en|deavoured to per&s;uade them to follow his fortunes in France; but, they were deaf to all his arguments and intreaties; he then directed his cour&s;e to Plymouth, where he was immediately arre&s;ted by the king's order, and after having made an un|&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to e&s;cape, reconveyed to the Tower of London.</P>

<P>In his ab&s;ence the count de Gondemar made heavy complaints again&s;t the expedition; and the king declared, that Raleigh had expre&s;s orders to avoid all di&s;pute and ho&s;tilities with the Spaniards. The amba&s;&s;ador, therefore, demanded that he &s;hould be puni&s;hed; otherwi&s;e the negotiation for the prince's marriage would mi&s;carry. James was not only intimidated by this declaration, but al&s;o incen&s;ed again&s;t Raleigh, who had returned without the trea&s;ure, even after having embroiled him with the court of Spain. He believed the &s;cheme was an impo&s;ition from the beginning; and that Raleigh's real de&s;ign was to plun|der the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, never doubting that he &s;hould be able to per&s;uade the &s;ailors into the&s;e mea&s;ures. The king, on the&s;e con&s;iderations, re&s;olved, that his former &s;entence &s;hould be executed. The ca&s;e was argued in the court of King's-bench, where Raleigh pleaded his commi&s;&s;ion, which he &s;aid im|plied a pardon, ina&s;much as it inve&s;ted him with the power of life and death<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coke. Wil&s;on.</NOTE> over tho&s;e whom he commanded. The lord chief ju&s;tice replied, that trea&s;on could not be pardoned except in expre&s;s terms; and ordered him to be executed

next morning, when he was accordingly beheaded on a &s;caffold erected in the Old|palace-yard at We&s;tmin&s;ter. He had formerly practi&s;ed low &s;hifts, and even feigned madne&s;s, to &s;ave his life. But, now he collected all his fortitude, and died with uncommon courage and compo&s;ure. He was certainly a man of ad|mirable talents; but turbulent, ra&s;h, and pre&s;umptuous. He had maintained a literary corre&s;pondence with prince Henry, who admired his character; and, at the queen's reque&s;t, &s;ent &s;ome of the cordial known by his name, to her &s;on in his la&s;t illne&s;s, affirming, that it was an infallible cure for fevers, except where poi&s;on had been admini&s;tered. This ridiculous a&s;&s;everation made &s;uch an im|pre&s;&s;ion upon her mind, that when the prince died, &s;he could not help believ|ing &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter means had been practi&s;ed again&s;t his life. Raleigh had for|merly done great mi&s;chief to the Spaniards in the reign of queen Elizabeth, and in divers memorials &s;ince his confinement, di&s;&s;uaded James from any alli|ance with that people. No wonder then that Gondemar &s;hould exert all his influence for the de&s;truction of &s;uch an enemy to his nation. On the whole, it mu&s;t be owned, that Raleigh &s;eems to have undertaken his la&s;t voyage with a piratical intention; and that he was capable of impo&s;ture, appears from his treati&s;e, intituled, The di&s;covery of the large, rich, and beautiful empire of Guiana: an empire which never exi&s;ted but in his own fancy and de|&s;cription.</P>

They ob&s;erved, That the &s;tates of Holland had &s;ent a fleet of fi&s;hermen on the coa&s;t of Britain, without a&s;king the king's permi&s;&s;ion; but, on the contrary, had &s;upplied them with a &s;quadron for their defence, as if they meant to brave the nation: That the court was become a &s;cene of debauchery, where nothing was heard but cur&s;es, bla&s;phemy, and impure di&s;cour&s;e: That the number of papi&s;ts was &s;urpri&s;ingly increa&s;ed: That the king's eagerne&s;s for the marriage of his &s;on with a daughter of Spain, too plainly denoted his bias towards the Roman catholic church: that the prerogative of the crown was extended to the oppre&s;&s;ion of the people in the deci&s;ions of the high commi&s;&s;ion-court and Star-chamber; in granting monopolies prejudicial to commerce; impri&s;oning members of the hou&s;e of commons contrary to law; and in levying money without con&s;ent of parliament. On the other hand, the king was no le&s;s di&s;&s;atisfied with his people for pretending to cen&s;ure his government; and he conceived a remarkable antipathy to parliaments, which he con&s;idered as an in&s;olent check upon the kingly prerogative. He con&s;oled him&s;elf, however, for the cen&s;ures of his &s;ubjects, with the agreeable pro&s;pect of the match, and the promi&s;e of receiving a very large &s;um as the infanta's portion.</P>

The &s;tates, including the prote&s;tant deputies, were afterwards convoked by the defenders, a certain numbers of per&s;ons cho&s;en and appointed to enforce the execution of edicts; and this a&s;&s;embly having pre&s;ented a petition to the em|peror, demanding the execution of the laws of the kingdom, and a reparation for the injuries they had &s;u&s;tained, adjourned it&s;elf to another day. The em|peror, in&s;tead of an&s;wering their petition, ordered his lieutenant in Bohemia to prevent the next meeting of the &s;tates, which had been convoked without his permi&s;&s;ion; but, the deputies, in&s;tead of obeying his command, repaired to the chancery, th$ew three of the emperor's officers out at the window, and expelled the Je&s;uits from the city. Then they publi&s;hed an apology for their conduct; and engaged in an a&s;&s;ociation for their mutual defence. Upon hearing the emperor was preparing to attack them, they cho&s;e four and twenty protectors, whom they impowered to levy troops, and impo&s;e taxes for the maintenance of the war.

But, notwith&s;tanding their oppo&s;ition, he was ac|knowledged king of Bohemia at the diet; and elected emperor in the month of Augu&s;t. Then the &s;tates took an oath that they would never own him as their &s;overeign; and cho&s;e Frederick elector palatine their king. That prince ac|cepted their offer without he&s;itation; di&s;patched the baron D'Aulna to &s;ollicit the advice of his father-in-law the king of England. But this was no more than a &s;imple compliment; for, without waiting his an&s;wer, he a&s;&s;embled a body of troops; and repairing to Prague, was there crowned on the fourth day of November.</P>

<P>Before the arrival of Frederick's envoy, James hearing of his elec|tion, a&s;&s;embled his council to deliberate upon the &s;ubject; and they were of opinion, that the king &s;hould exhort his &s;on-in-law to refu&s;e the crown of Bo|hemia. They were influenced by the &s;entiments of the king, who con&s;idered the conduct of the &s;tates as rebellious and puritanical; and dreaded that Fre|derick's oppo&s;ition to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria might prejudice the darling match of $word$ &s;on, and the projected alliance between the kings of England and Spain. James was &s;o incen&s;ed again&s;t the elector, when he heard he had accepted the crown, that he refu&s;ed to grant an audience to his envoy: by his amba&s;&s;adors in foreign courts, he di&s;&s;avowed the &s;tep which his &s;on-in-law had taken, and even refu&s;ed to honour him with the kingly title. He attempted to per&s;uade him to renounce the crown, and influence the &s;tates of Bohemia to acknowledge Ferdinand. With this view he &s;ent two amba&s;&s;adors to P$ague; but his ad|monitions were of no &s;ignification. Mean while the court of Madrid did not $ail to encourage James in his pacific di&s;po&s;ition. There the whole conver&s;ation turned upon the ju&s;tice, genero&s;ity, and moderation of the Engli&s;h monarch. The negotiation for the marriage, which had been interrupted on account of the pope's he&s;itating to grant a di&s;pen&s;ation, was now re&s;umed; and Cotting|ton was given to under&s;tand, that &s;hould it be much longer delayed, they would either conclude the marriage without it, or fall upon means to extort the pope's compliance. That mini&s;ter did not fall into the &s;nare. Being well acquainted with the views and &s;entiments of Philip, he exhorted his maje&s;ty to break off the negotiation, a&s;&s;uring him the de&s;ign of the court of Spain was to amu&s;e him with vain pretences. James was of another opinion: he ordered Cottington to declare to king of Spain, that he had no &s;hare in the affair of Bohemia; that the elector had acted without his knowledge; and that he di&s;approved of his conduct in accepting the crown.</P>

Frederick's affairs at fir&s;t wore a promi&s;ing a&s;pect.

<P>Frederick having marched into Bohemia with ten thou&s;and of the Palatine troops, the archduke Albert levied an army of thirty thou&s;and men in the Low Countries, in order to attack the Palatinate. The Dutch commu|nicated the de&s;ign of this armament to the court of London; but James, in|&s;tead of taking effectual methods for the pre&s;ervation of his daughter and her family, contented him&s;elf with ordering Edmonds his amba&s;&s;ador at Bru&s;&s;els, to demand the meaning of the&s;e levies. The archduke replied, that the troops were rai&s;ed by the expre&s;s order of the Spani&s;h king; and that, perhaps he might learn their de&s;tination from Spinola, who was appointed general of the expedition. This officer being interrogated on the &s;ame &s;ubject, pretended ignorance, alledging his orders were &s;ealed, and that he could not open them until the troops &s;hould be upon the march; but, he told the amba&s;&s;ador that if he would accompany him in his route, he might &s;oon be informed. The de&s;ign was &s;o palpable, that the people of England began to exclaim again&s;t the king's indolence and in&s;en&s;ibility. Neverthele&s;s, he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his &s;cheme of neutrality; and the nation was certainly obliged to him for prevent|ing their being involved in a war, which would have not only con&s;umed their trea&s;ures, but al&s;o deprived them of an advantageous commerce with the Spaniards both in Europe and America. His forbearance, however, was ow|ing to other reflections. By dint of &s;ollicitations, he was prevailed upon to allow one regiment of two thou&s;and four hundred men, to be rai&s;ed for the &s;ervice of the elector Palatine. It was commanded by Horatio Vere, who had &s;erved with reputation in Holland; and the earls of Oxford and E&s;&s;ex acted<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wil&s;on$</NOTE> as captains to two companies of volunteers. They were tran&s;ported to Hol|land, pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine below the Wezel, were e&s;corted to Franckfort by a body of troops under prince Federick Henry of Na&s;&s;au; and on the fir&s;t day of October, joined the army of the palatine's allies, conducted by the margrave of An&s;pach.</P>

<P>By this time Spinola had reached the Palatinate, where he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;ome incon&s;iderable places; but, the &s;ea&s;on being far ad|vanced, both armies &s;oon retired into winter quarters. In the beginning of this year, the French king had &s;ent the dukes of Angoule&s;me and Bethune, with Mr. De&s;preaux to the princes of Germany, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in appea&s;ing the troubles of Hungary and Bohemia. James of England had likewi&s;e di&s;patched Sir Ed|ward Wotton to Germany, with the &s;ame de&s;ign; and after he had vi&s;ited the princes &s;eparately, he arrived at Vienna, where he pre&s;ented &s;ome propo&s;als, in the name of his ma&s;ter, to which Ferdinand payed no regard. Frederick elector palatine was now put under the ban of the empire. The elector of Sax|ony entered Lu&s;ace, which he &s;ubdued. The duke of Bavaria joining the count de Bucquoy the imperial general in Bohemia, they advanced towards Prague, in the neighbourhood of which the palatine was po&s;ted. A battle immediately en&s;ued$ and Frederick being totally defeated, fled with his wife and family to Holland. The inhabitants of Prague opened their gates to the Imperiali&s;ts.

The palatine was abandoned by almo&s;t all his allies. Even his general the prince of Anhalt, engaged in the emperor's &s;ervice; though count Mansfeldt &s;till pre&s;erved his fidelity.

The amba&s;&s;ador executed his commi&s;&s;ion in &s;uch a manner as gave offence to the con&s;table de Luines, who complained of his arrogance to the king, and he was recalled. He afterwards begged his maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion to challenge the con&s;table to &s;ingle combat for having belied him; but, James refu&s;ed his reque&s;t, and &s;ent in his room the vi&s;count of Don|ca&s;ter, lately created earl of Carli&s;le, who expended great &s;ums of money to very little purpo&s;e; for, the Huguenots reaped no benefit from his &s;olli|citations.</P>

<P>The campaign of the Palatinate was no &s;oon$r ended, than the earl of E&s;&s;ex returned to England, and a&s;&s;ured the king, that without powerful and &s;peedy &s;uccours, that country would fall into the hands of the enemy. Whe|ther James was alarmed at this intelligence, or de&s;irous of u&s;ing this pretext for rai&s;ing money, he declared to count Gondemar, that $e would not &s;tand tamely, and &s;ee his grandchildren deprived of their inheritance; and demanded a Benevolence of his &s;ubjects for the defence of the Palatinate. This expedient did not &s;ucceed according to his expectation, and the people continuing to blame his indolence and indifference for the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, he convoked<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$$hworth.</NOTE> a parliament. With a view to per&s;uade the nation that he $as determined to pur&s;ue vigorous mea&s;ures, he convened a number of noblemen and officers of reputation, to deliberate upon the mo&s;t effectual means to pro&s;ecute the war; and, in order to prevent the repro$c$es and obloquy of his &s;ubject$, he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, forbidding them to di&s;cour&s;e of &s;tate affairs.</P>

<P>James, without all que&s;tion$ wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve the Palatinate to his &s;on-in-law; but, his we$kne&s;s was cajoled in &s;uch a m$nner by Gondemar, that he believed no expedient would be &s;o effectual for that purpo&s;e, as the match of his &s;on with the infant$ of Spain; and that this &s;cheme would mi&s;|carry &s;hould he attempt to take any other &s;tep in the elector's favour: be&s;ides, his aver&s;ion to war was in&s;uperable. He re&s;olved, however, to &s;eem bent on vigorous mea&s;ures, in hope that he &s;hould receive ample &s;ub&s;idi$s from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> parliament, which met on the twentieth day of January. The king, as u&s;ual, made a long &s;peech to both hou&s;es, explaining the duty of parliaments; expa|tiating on his own merit and nece&s;&s;ities; and demanding &s;upplies for the relief of the Palatinate, in defence of which, he declared he would hazard his crown, and even the life of his own &s;on, &s;hould he mi&s;carry in his endeavours to pro|cure a rea&s;onable pacification. The hou&s;e of commons con&s;idering the urgency of the occa&s;ion, and being extremely incen&s;ed again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, immediately granted two &s;ub&s;idies, with which the king was &s;atisfied for the pre&s;ent. This affair being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the commons received petitions again&s;t the increa&s;e of popi&s;h recu&s;ants, moncpolies, and projectors. The king had farmed to certain inviduals, the power of lice$&s;ing taverns and public hou&s;es; and granted to Sir Giles Montpe&s;&s;on and Francis Michel, an exclu&s;ive patent for the &s;ale of gold and &s;ilver lace. By virtue of this privilege, they had been guilty of &s;uch &s;candalous fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion, that, upon complaint to the
<PB N="187" REF="1890">
upper hou&s;e, they were committed to pri&s;on; though Montpe&s;&s;on, who was Buckingham's creature, found means to e&s;cape: but he was degraded from the dignity of knight, and his e&s;tate confi&s;cated. The other was &s;entenced to do public penance in the &s;treet, &s;itting a-hor&s;eback with his face to the tail, to pay a fine of a thou&s;and pounds, and be impri&s;oned for life.</P>

<P>James perceiving with what eagerne&s;s the two hou&s;es proceeded again&s;t the&s;e delinquents, began to be afraid of his favourite Buckingham, who had been the author of tho&s;e monopolies. He therefore went to the hou&s;e of peers, and &s;oothed the parliament with the mo&s;t affectionate expre&s;&s;ions; a&s;|&s;uring them, upon the faith of a chri&s;tian king, that if he had known of tho&s;e grievances, he would have puni&s;hed the authors of his own accord; and cau|tioning them again&s;t giving ear to tho&s;e who &s;hould accu&s;e the innocent in&s;tead of the guilty. They under&s;tood his meaning, and forbore to trace the enormity to its fountain. James afterwards under&s;tanding that the commons had im|peached chancellor Bacon, lately created baron of Verulam and vi&s;count of St. Alban's, he again harrangued both hou&s;es, repre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ity of pu|ni&s;hing corrupted judges; and &s;olliciting further &s;ub&s;idies, as the former &s;up|ply granted by the commons was already expended for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the palatine and his family, who had taken refuge in Holland. He ob&s;erved that great &s;ums would be requi&s;ite to defray the expence of extraordinary amba&s;&s;a|dors to all the courts of Europe, as well as for an army to march into the Pa|latinate, in ca&s;e his negotiations &s;hould prove ineffectual; and, la&s;tly, he pro|te&s;ted before God, that he would not di&s;&s;olve the parliament, until the affairs which were then under their con&s;ideration &s;hould be fully determined.</P>

<P>The chancellor being committed to the Tower, and con&s;cious of that corruption which was laid to his charge, pre&s;ented a petition to the hou&s;e of peers, confe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf guilty, and reque&s;ting that he might not be ex|po&s;ed to the &s;hame of a public trial. They in&s;i&s;ted upon his owning every particular article of the impeachment$ yet, notwith&s;tanding this minute confe&s;&s;ion, he was deprived of his office of chancellor, and even rendered in|capable of &s;itting in the upper hou&s;e of parliament, fined in forty thou&s;and pounds, and condemned to be impri&s;oned in the Tower during the king's plea&s;ure. In con&s;ideration of his great genius, James remitted his fine, re|lea&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wil&s;on. Ru&s;hworth.

He retrieved the favour of his &s;overeign, by writing the panegyric of Henry VII. who&s;e character James revered as the model of &s;a|gacity and king-craft, and who&s;e conduct he endeavoured in vain to imitate. It was in this parliament that the two factions, known by the name of court and country party, began to proceed on a regular plan of oppo&s;ition.

The lower hou&s;e looking upon this &s;tep as an encroachment on their privileges, de&s;ired a conference with the peers, that they might concert an ad|dre&s;s on the &s;ubject. James giving them to under&s;tand, that he would not &s;uffer his prerogative to be the &s;ubject of di&s;pute, the lords refu&s;ed their con|currence; and the commons prote&s;ted that the king's re&s;olution hindered them from fini&s;hing the work they had begun, for the benefit of the public. The king repairing to the hou&s;e of peers, told them he would indulge them with a delay of ten days; and they, after a conference with the commons, demanded it for fifteen.

<P>By this time, Bohemia, Moravia, and Sile&s;ia, had &s;ubmitted to the emperor: the upper Palatinate was &s;ubdued by the duke of Bavaria. Spi|nola, after having made many conque&s;ts in the lower Palatinate, con&s;ented to a truce for five weeks; and the archduke a&s;cribed this conde&s;cen&s;ion to his re|gard for the king of England; though, in fact, he was obliged to recal his troops to the Low Countries, becau&s;e the truce of twelve years between$ Spain and Holland was expired; and he was glad of this ce&s;&s;ation, during which the emperor might fill the place of tho&s;e forces. This &s;hort truce being ex|pired, the Spani&s;h troops left under the command of Don Gon&s;alez de Cor|dova, being joined by a &s;trong reinforcement, undertook the &s;iege of Franken|dal, defended by &s;ome of the Engli&s;h forces under Vere; but he was obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege at the approach of Mansfeldt, who, in his turn, retired be|fore count Tilly into Alface.

<P>The archduke, in order to divert James from any de&s;ign of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Dutch, now that ho&s;tilities were renewed between them and Spain, gave him to under&s;tand, that peace might be ea&s;ily re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the empire, provided the palatine would offer a rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction to the emperor. He wrote in favour of Frederick to Ferdinand; and the letter was communi|cated to James, who firmly believed that, in con&s;ideration of him, the dif|ference would be amicably determined. To this letter the emperor replied, That, by his great regard for the king of England, he was di&s;po&s;ed to con|clude a peace upon equitable terms with the palatine. The king of Spain de|clared to Ferdinand, that &s;hould he, according to report, be&s;tow the upper Pa|latinate upon the duke of Bavaria, he mu&s;t no longer expect the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Spain. All the&s;e letters were imparted to James, or to his amba&s;&s;adors, and
<PB N="189" REF="1910">
to confirm his opinion, that any appearance of di&s;tru&s;t would ruin all his mea&s;ures. In the&s;e &s;entiments he di&s;patched the lord Digby as his amba&s;|&s;ador to Vienna, to demand of the emperor, that the imperial ban again&s;t the elector palatine &s;hould be revoked, or at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pended; and that Frederick &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hereditary dominions: in which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Du Che$ne.

Ferdinand &s;till profe&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t veneration for the king of Britain, declaring that all he de&s;ired was &s;uitable &s;atisfaction for the injuries he had received; but he ob|&s;erved, that he had undertaken the war with the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;e|veral princes, without who&s;e con&s;ent he would not take any material re&s;olution; but he &s;aid he had convoked a diet at Rati&s;bon, the re&s;ult of who&s;e determi|nations he would impart to the king of England. The archduke dying at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> Bru&s;&s;els about this period; and his widow the infanta I&s;abella writing to Fer|dinand in favour of the palatine, Digby &s;eized this opportunity of demanding a truce for the lower Palatinate: and the emperor promi&s;ed to comply with his demand, provided the duke of Bavaria would con&s;ent to &s;uch a ce&s;&s;ation: he even advi&s;ed Digby to go and negotiate the truce with that prince, and he found him in the upper Palatinate; but, when he mentioned the cau&s;e of his coming, the duke told him the country was almo&s;t wholly &s;ubdued, and he would take care that in a very little time there &s;hould be no occa&s;ion for further ho&s;tilities. James being informed of this reply, complained to the emperor of the duke's having invaded the Palatinate; and propo&s;ed that his &s;on in|law &s;hould renounce his preten&s;ions to the crown of Bohemia, &s;ubmit to the emperor, and implore his pardon on his knees: he at the &s;ame declared, that if he could not obtain favour for his &s;on-in-law by fair means, he would &s;up|port him by force of arms.

Then lord Digby recounted the particulars of his em|ba&s;&s;y; adding, that a large &s;um of money was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub&s;i&s;t the army commanded by the count de Mansfeldt, and to &s;end a reinforcement of Engli&s;h troops into the Palatinate.</P>

The king being informed of their proceedings, was &s;hocked at this unprecedented re|mon&s;trance, which not only taxed him with in&s;incerity, and attachment to the Romi&s;h religion, but al&s;o &s;truck at the very root of his prerogative, in directing his conduct and admini&s;tration. He then re&s;ided at Newmarket, from whence he &s;ent a letter to the &s;peaker, commanding the hou&s;e &s;o forbear meddling with the affairs of government, the marriage of his &s;on, or the honour of his allies. He gave them to under&s;tand, that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the right and power to puni&s;h faules committed during the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, as well as at any other time; and that he would not fail to exerci&s;e that power as often as the in&s;olence of the members &s;hould give him cau&s;e. He concluded with a&s;&s;uring them, that if they had touched upon any points which he had formerly for|bidden them to di&s;cu&s;s, he would not deign to receive or an&s;wer their pe|tition. The commons were incen&s;ed, not intimidated, by this menacing let|ter: they knew their own &s;trength and the king's weakne&s;s, and immediately framed a new petition, to which they tacked the remon&s;trance. This new paper was conceived in very re&s;pectful terms: but it was no le&s;s bold than re|&s;pectful. After having reminded him of the chearfulne&s;s with which they undertook to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the defence of the Palatinate, they ob&s;erved that their zeal for the pr$$e&s;tant religion, and the intere&s;t of his maje&s;ty's family, had induced them to repre&s;ent the dangers with which both were threatened: and to point out remedies for tho&s;e evils: that, by his letter to the &s;peaker, he &s;eemed bent upon depriving them of the parliamentary liberty to &s;peak freely in the hou&s;e, as well as of the juri&s;diction which the hou&s;e exerci&s;ed over its own members: they therefore begged he would not violate a privilege which was their undoubted right, and which they inherited of their ance&s;tors; a right which he him&s;elf had confirmed in his &s;peeches to parliament, and without which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cu&s;s and determine the affairs that might fall under their cogniz$noe. They &s;ent this petition with the remon&s;trance to the king by twelve deputies, who were treated in a mo&s;t ungracious manner. He received the petition, but refu&s;ed the remon&s;tance; and in a few days &s;ent his an&s;wer in writing. He therein chid them &s;everely for pre&s;uming to trench upon his prerogative; mentioned the &s;teps he had taken for the defence of the Palatinate; laid the blame of the war upon the imprudence of his &s;on-in law; complained that they had &s;truck at the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of &s;overeignty, by violating his alliances; pre&s;uming to direct his conduct in the pro&s;ecution of the war; and dictating to him with regard to his &s;on's marriage, as well as concerning the amne&s;ty they had demanded. He told them he was an old and
<PB N="191" REF="1930">
wi&s;e king that needed none of their coun&s;el; that tho&s;e matters were above their comprehen&s;ion; and they ought to remember the Latin proverb, Ne &s;utor ultra crepidam. In all undertakings a man ought to have regard to his own abilities. He &s;aid they had mi&s;interpreted his letter to the &s;peaker; that though their privileges were derived from the favour of his predece&s;&s;ors and him&s;elf, he would be careful in pre&s;erving them, until they &s;hould invade his preroga|tive; but in that ca&s;e he would &s;trip them of tho&s;e boa&s;ted privilege&s;, which &s;erved only to dimini&s;h the faire&s;t flowers of the crown. The commons, alarmed at this la&s;t part of his declaration, had immediate recour&s;e to a pro|te&s;tation, in which they repeated all their former preten&s;ions to freedom of &s;peech, and liberty of offering their advice to the crown, without limitation; and affirmed, that the liberties, franchi&s;es, privileges, and juri&s;diction of par|liament, are the antient and indubitable right of inheritance peculiar to the &s;ubjects of England. James no &s;ooner under&s;tood their intention, than he<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth. Wil&s;on. Coke.</NOTE> ha&s;tened to town; and &s;ending for the journal of the hou&s;e of commons, tore out with his own hand the prote&s;tation, which he declared null and void, both on account of the manner in which it had been framed, and of the mat|ter it contained. It had (as he alledged) been drawn up by a committee, and pre&s;ented at an unu&s;ual hour, and in a tumultuous manner, when very few members were in the hou&s;e. He therefore cancelled the prote&s;tation by an act of council. In a few days after this effort in behalf of his prerogative he di&s;&s;olved the parliament by proclamation, and then wreaked his vengeance upon tho&s;e members of the hou&s;e of commons who had taken freedoms with his power and admini&s;tration. Cook, Philips, Selden, Pym, and Mallery, were committed to pri&s;on. Diggs, Crew, Rich, and Sir James Perrot, were exiled to Ireland, on pretence of executing &s;ome commi&s;&s;ion in that country; and a pretext was found for confining the earls of Oxford and Southampton in the Tower.</P>

<P>The whole nation was now divided between the court and the country parties. All the papi&s;ts and the Arminians, which were by this time formed into a &s;ect in England, e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the king, and the puritans declared for the oppo&s;ition. Faction was inflamed into mutual rancour and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1621.</NOTE> animo&s;ity. The royali&s;ts affected to confound all their oppo&s;ers under the name of Puritans; and the&s;e in their turn accu&s;ed the royali&s;ts of popery and Arminiani&s;m.

James had now not only entailed upon him&s;elf the hatred of a powerful faction at home, but al&s;o incurred the contempt of all the &s;tates upon the continent. In his own kingdom they revived the &s;candalous in&s;inuations touching his mother's connexion with David Riccio; and in the Spani&s;h Netherlands he was publicly ridiculed in comedies, pictures, and pa&s;quinades * <NOTE PLACE="foot">&dagger; In a theatrical piece acted at Bru&s;&s;els, a courier was introduced, declaring the melancholy tidings that the Palatinate would &s;oon be wre&s;ted from the emperor; ina&s;much as the king of Den|mark had agreed to furni&s;h the expelled elector with one hundred thous;and pickled herrings, the Dutch had re&s;olved to &s;pare him the like number of butter-boxes, and the king of Eng|land to employ one hundred thou&s;and amba&s;&s;a|dors.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e in&s;ults the king continued to negotiate. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Digby to Spain, and We&s;ton to Bru&s;&s;els, in order to fini&s;h the two important affairs of the marriage and the Palatinate; and, in order to fill his exhau&s;ted coffers, directed the judges on their circuits to demand a Bene|volence of his &s;ubjects. His imagination was &s;till regaled with the portion of two millions, which he &s;hould receive with the infanta of Spain; for which rea&s;on he ordered Digby to conclude the match, without &s;tipulating for the re|&s;titution of the Palatinate; believing, that after the celebration of the nuptials, Philip would not refu&s;e him that favour. When Digby, who was in the cour&s;e of this year created earl of Bri&s;tol, &s;et out for Madrid, the king di&s;patched Gage to Rome, in order to ha&s;ten the di&s;pen&s;ation; and, in order to render his holine&s;s the more propitious, relea&s;ed all the popi&s;h recu&s;ants who were in pri&s;on, by an order under the great &s;eal, addre&s;&s;ed to all the judges of the king|dom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> As this arbitrary &s;tep of di&s;pen&s;ing with the laws produced$ loud cla|mours over all the nation, the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, keeper of the &s;eals, publi&s;hed a ju&s;tification of the king's conduct.

<P>The count of Schwartzenburg, when he arrived in England, was found to have no power to conclude a truce; and therefore there was a nece&s;|&s;ity for negotiating with the archduche&s;s at Bru&s;&s;els, whither, as we have ob|&s;erved, We&s;ton had been di&s;patched as amba&s;&s;ador; and, to pave the way towards &s;ucce&s;s, lord Vaux, a papi&s;t, was permitted to levy two thou&s;and men in England, to &s;erve this prince&s;s in the war again&s;t the &s;tates general. Mean|while prince Chri&s;tian of Brun&s;wick, admini&s;trator of the bi&s;hopric of Hal|ber&s;tadt, who had accompanied the palatine to the Hague, levied an army in We&s;tphalia, which had retired into Al&s;ace: but, being oppo&s;ed by the Spani&s;h forces, the count of Anhalt, and the Bavarian army under Tilly, they found great difficulty in entering the Palatinate. The elector, travelling through France, arrived at the army of Mansfeldt, which had advanced to Germer|&s;heim: but the prince of Baden was defeated on the &s;ixth day of May. In a month after this action, count Tilly routed the palatine and Mansfeldt, who fled to Manheim; and he afterwards attacked prince Chri&s;tian, who, though wor&s;ted in the engagement, made &s;hift to join the elector with good part of his forces. They were afterwards &s;urrounded by the Spani&s;h and Bavarians, reinforced to the number of fifty thou&s;and. Then the palatine returned to Holland. The prince of Brun&s;wick and Mansfeldt marching to the Low-Countries, were attacked in Brabant by Gon&s;alez de Cordova; and the battle was $ought with equal &s;ucce&s;s on both &s;ides. The prince of Brun&s;wick lo&s;t his arm by a cannon-ball; and Mansfeldt continued his route to Holland. Tilly being left without an enemy in the Palatinate, reduced Heidelberg and Man|heim, and then undertook the &s;iege of Frankendal.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions conferences were begun at Bru&s;&s;els, at the d$&s;ire of James, in order to procure the truce which he had de&s;ired; but the Spaniards refu&s;ed to treat with any but principals, and the Engli&s;h am|ba&s;&s;ador was not ve&s;&s;ed with &s;ufficient powers from the palatine and his allies. When the&s;e were obtained, the archdutche&s;s owned that &s;he her&s;elf had no other power than a &s;imple letter from the emperor, de&s;iring him to concert mea&s;ures with the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador: in a word, that prince&s;s and the count de Schwartzenburg protracted the negotiation on various pretences, until Hei|delberg was taken and Manheim be&s;ieged. James wrote to the Spani&s;h mo|narch, de&s;iring that the affairs of the palatine might continue in their pre&s;ent po&s;ture till the expiration of the truce, and that the blockade of Manheim might be rai&s;ed. But before Philip could give orders for this purpo&s;e, that city had &s;urrendered, and Tilly had inve&s;ted Frankendal, which he would &s;oon have<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. de Re|bellion de Boheme.</NOTE> reduced, had not the overflowing of the rivers compelled him to abandon his enterprize.</P>

<P>Hitherto the court of Spain had amu&s;ed James with a fruitle&s;s negotiation for a marriage to which the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria was extremely aver&s;e. The pope would not grant the di&s;pen&s;ation, without &s;tipulating &s;uch advantages for the catholic religion in England, as he could not believe James would ever allow: but this prince was &s;o intent upon the match and the two millions, that he &s;ub&s;cribed to all his conditions; and the king of Spain, fore&s;eeing that his conde&s;cen&s;ion would, in all probability, pave the way for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of popery in the dominions of Great-Britain, re&s;olved at la&s;t to be&s;tow the in|fanta upon the prince of Wales. He perceived that the king of England would not be much longer amu&s;ed by artifices, of which he began to find him&s;elf the dupe; and took it for granted, that he would, upon his being undeceived, &s;up|port the palatine effectually; this con&s;ideration, added to the other motive, determined him in &s;avour of the marriage. In the&s;e &s;entiments he wrote to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1623.</NOTE> the archdutche&s;s, de&s;iring &s;he would order the general to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Frankendal, and renew the congre&s;s for a truce at London, where it was ac|cordingly concluded for eighteen months, on condition that Frankendal &s;hould be put into the hands of the infanta I&s;abella, who &s;hould re&s;tore it at the ex|piration of the truce to the Engli&s;h; and that the elector palatine &s;hould re|nounce all connexion with the prince of Brun&s;wick and count Mansfeldt. Be|fore the conclu&s;ion of this ridiculous treaty, the emperor at the diet of Rati&s;bon had transferred the electoral dignity and the upper Palatinate to the duke of Bavaria, in &s;pite of a vigorous oppo&s;ition from &s;everal princes, who dreaded &s;uch an example.</P>

<P>The king of England &s;aw with unconcern his &s;on-in-law thus &s;tripped of his e&s;tate and dignity; and &s;till con&s;oled him&s;elf for the contempt of mankind, with the hope of the marriage, in which he by this time really had rea&s;on to think he &s;hould not be di&s;appointed. He and the prince of Wales had &s;igned all the articles propo&s;ed by the courts of Rome and Madrid, and agreed to every regulation touching the infanta's portion and her jointure. The counts of Olivarez and Gondemar had &s;hewn Philip's approbation, in a wri|ting &s;igned with his own hand. As the di&s;pen&s;ation was expected from Rome in the month of March, or April at farthe&s;t, it was re&s;olved that the marriage &s;hould be celebrated in four days after it &s;hould be received; and, that in
<PB N="194" REF="1960">
twenty days after this ceremony, the infanta &s;hould &s;et out for England. No|thing could have prevented the conclu&s;ion of this long expected marriage, but the frantic &s;tep which was now taken by the prince of Wales and the marquis of Buckingham. This favourite, with a view either to have the honour of fini&s;h|ing an affair of &s;uch importance, or to contract a nearer intimacy with the prince of Wales; or, la&s;tly, to di&s;play his influence and gallantry to the Spani&s;h nation, per&s;uaded Charles to &s;urpri&s;e Philip with a vi&s;it, which, from the ro|mantic nature of the adventure, would captivate the admiration and affection of that monarch and his &s;ubjects, and induce him to take &s;ome re&s;olution in favour of the palatine, as a return for this generous confidence. The prince approved of the propo&s;al, which was communicated to the king, when he happened to be in good humour; and he &s;igned his a&s;&s;ent before he had reflected on the con&s;equences, agreeing that the prince and Buckingham &s;hould &s;et out in di&s;gui&s;e, attended by Sir Francis Cottington, &s;ecretary to Charles, and En|dymion Porter, gentlemen of his bed-chamber. The&s;e were pitched upon, not only as per&s;ons in whom they could confide, but al&s;o becau&s;e they had been at the court of Spain, and under&s;tood the language of the country. When James began to con&s;ider this &s;trange project, the timidity of his di&s;po&s;ition exaggera|ted all the dangerous con&s;equence that might attend the execution of it; and next day he imparted them to his &s;on and favourite, begging they would think no more of &s;uch a ra&s;h undertaking. The prince in&s;i&s;ted upon his promi&s;e; the marquis upbraided him with breach of faith: Sir Francis Cottington, being con&s;ulted, confirmed all the king's fears: James broke out into a pa&s;&s;ion of tears and lamentation, exclaiming he was undone, and that he &s;hould lo&s;e baby Charles. Buckingham chid, reviled, and threatened Cottington for his pre&s;uming to give his advice in affairs of &s;tate; and the king, rather than di&s;oblige his favourite, renewed his con&s;ent to the journey.</P>

<P>The nece&s;&s;ary preparations being made, they &s;et out for France, through which they travelled in di&s;gui&s;e, and even ventured to appear at a ball in Paris, where Charles &s;aw the prince&s;s Henrietta, whom he afterwards e&s;pou|&s;ed. In eleven days after his departure from England he arrived at Madrid, where Philip received him in the mo&s;t cordial manner. He expre&s;&s;ed the deepe&s;t obligation to him for the generous confidence he had repo&s;ed in his honour; pre&s;ented him with a golden key that opened the locks of all his apartments; and introduced him into the palace with all the pomp of a coro|nation. The privy-council were publicly ordered to obey him as the king him|&s;elf; all the pri&s;ons of Spain were thrown open in honour of this royal &s;tran|ger; &s;umptuary laws were &s;u&s;pended; and the king honoured him with pre|cedency in every place but the prince's own apartment, where he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be at home. The only circum&s;tance in which they maintained any re&s;erve, related to the infanta, whom the Spani&s;h manners would not allow him to &s;ee but in public, until the di&s;pen&s;ation &s;hould arrive. In a word, nothing could be more noble and generous than the conduct of Philip on this remarkable occa&s;ion. True it is, endeavours were u&s;ed to convert him to the catholic religion, both by theological arguments and political rea&s;ons. He received a letter from pope Gregory XV. exhorting him to return within the pale of the church, and imitate his glorious ance&s;tors, who had &s;ignalized them&s;elves &s;o
<PB N="195" REF="1970">
often in defence of religion. To this he &s;ent a civil an&s;wer, which gave offence to narrow minds among the prote&s;tants. When the di&s;pen&s;ation arrived they found it clogged with certain additional articles, importing, That the infanta &s;hould have a church in London: That the children of the marriage &s;hould be educated by the mother, until they &s;hould have attained the tenth year of their age: That the nur&s;es &s;hould be catholics appointed by the infanta: And that the king of England &s;hould give &s;ecurity for the performance of the articles concerning religion. Philip agreed to be &s;ecurity for James, to whom the new|drawn articles were &s;ent by Cottington.</P>

<P>His arrival in England was attended with a report that the pope and the king of Spain demanded a toletation for Engli&s;h papi&s;ts. James ac|tually con&s;ulted his council on this &s;ubject, and received a letter from Abbot archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, conjuring him, as he tendered his own &s;afety and the welfare of the nation, to forbear taking &s;uch a pernicious mea&s;ure. James, without paying the lea&s;t regard to this remon&s;trance, &s;igned, &s;ealed, and &s;wore to the execution of the articles, by &s;ome of which he promi&s;ed that the Roman catholics &s;hould not be mole&s;ted in the private exerci&s;e of their religion; and that no new laws &s;hould be made to their prejudice. Cottington was &s;ent back to Madrid with tho&s;e ratified conditions; and the king was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the &s;ucce&s;s of the negotiation, that he created his favourite Villiers, duke of Buckingham, though there was not another per&s;on in England who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a dignity. His conde&s;cen&s;ion was &s;o great that Philip began to doubt his &s;incerity. He po&s;tponed the departure of the infanta to the &s;pring; and in the mean time ordered his amba&s;&s;ador in England to de&s;ire the king would be|gin to execute his engagements in favour of the catholics. James was embar|ra&s;&s;ed by this demand: he dreaded the con&s;equence of proclaiming a toleration; but he delivered into the amba&s;&s;ador's hand a declaration of his council, &s;pe|cifying his intention for that purpo&s;e; and the court of Spain &s;eemed to be &s;a|tisfied with this expedient. Pope Gregory dying in the interim, the nuncio refu&s;ed to deliver the di&s;pen&s;ation, until it &s;hould be confirmed by the new pon|tiff; and Urban XIII. being rai&s;ed to the papacy, deferred this &s;tep, in hope of the prince's conver&s;ion.</P>

<P>The count de Olivarez, Philip's prime mini&s;ter, reminded Buckingham of his having promi&s;ed that Charles &s;hould become a pro&s;elyte to the catholic religion; and the duke gave him the lie without he&s;itation. This Engli&s;h mini&s;ter had rendered him&s;elf extremely odious to the Spaniards by his levity and pre&s;umption; and he, in his turn, hated them with the like aver&s;ion. He &s;aw the di&s;po&s;ition of Charles was perfectly well &s;uited to the Spani&s;h gravity and re&s;erve; and was afraid that &s;hould the marriage &s;ucceed, his in|fluence would be &s;uper&s;eded by the intere&s;t of that nation at the court of Eng|land. He had now gained the a&s;cendancy over the prince's &s;pirit; and whatever arguments he may have u&s;ed, certain it is, he all of a &s;udden detached him from the pro&s;ecution of the alliance. It was a more difficult ta&s;k to per&s;uade the king to part at once with the hopes he had &s;o long indulged; yet even this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendo$.</NOTE> he accompli&s;hed. He gave him to under&s;tand by letters, that Philip had no intention to effect the re&s;titution of the Palatinate, nor even to accompli&s;h the contract of marriage; but that the prince ran the ri&s;que of being detained all

his life in Spain. Charles wrote at the &s;ame time to his father, that he did not<NOTE PLACE="marg">W$$$on $word$</NOTE> expect to return; and de&s;ired he would thenceforward con&s;ider the electre&s;s as his &s;ole heir.</P>

<P>James, alarmed at this intelligence, wrote in the fir&s;t tran&s;port of his fear to Buckingham, charging him to bring home the prince immediately; and forthwith di&s;patched ve&s;&s;els to St. Andero in Bi&s;cay, to take them on board. The duke immediately communicated this order to Philip, alledging the prince's return was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to quiet the fears and &s;u&s;picions of the Engli&s;h people: but, in the mean time, he would leave a proxy, to e&s;pou&s;e the infanta, as &s;oon as the confirmed di&s;pen&s;ation &s;hould arrive. The king of Spain made no objection to his return, but offered to be the prince's proxy; a pro|curation for this purpo&s;ed was drawn up and &s;igned by the prince of Wales, who delivered it to the earl of Bri&s;tol, with order to put it into the hands of Philip in ten days after the arrival of the di&s;pen&s;ation. The Spani&s;h monarch accompanied his gue&s;t to the E&s;curial, where he was royally regaled; and erected a pillar on the &s;pot where they parted, as a monument of their friend|&s;hip. The prince, before he embarked, di&s;patched one of his dome&s;tics with a letter to the earl of Bri&s;tol at Madrid, de&s;iring that he would not part with the procuration until he (Charles) &s;hould be &s;atisfied that the infanta, after the ceremony, &s;hould not take the veil. The amba&s;&s;ador, willing to remove this ob&s;tacle before the arrival of the di&s;pen&s;ation, demanded &s;ecurities of the Spani&s;h monarch, who returned a very &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, which the earl communi|cated to king James and the prince of Wales. James had not yet re&s;igned his hope of the marriage, though he now became more than ever &s;ollicitous about the intere&s;t of his daughter. He, in a letter to Bri&s;tol, expre&s;&s;ed his hope that beforeChri&s;tmas he &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed with two articles of agreeable news, namely, the marriage of his &s;on, and the re&s;toration of his daughter.

It was at this period that the prince of Wales di&s;clo&s;ed to his father the aver&s;ion he had conceived to the marriage. His remon&s;trance was &s;econded by the duke of Buckingham, who had for many years governed him with the mo&s;t de&s;potic authority; and his influence mu&s;t have been very powerful indeed, to overcome the king's at|tachment to an alliance, for which he had &s;o long &s;acrificed the intere&s;t of his family. He forbade the earl of Bri&s;tol to part with the procuration; an order which was no &s;ooner &s;ignified to Philip, that the infanta laid a&s;ide the title of prince&s;s of Wales, which &s;he had a&s;&s;umed &s;ince the arrival of the di&s;pen&s;ation; and a &s;top was put to all the preparations for the marriage. The earl of Bri|&s;tol<NOTE PLACE="marg">W$l&s;on. D$ Che&s;ne.

The king's reluctance to &s;uch mea&s;ures
<PB N="197" REF="1990">
was overpowered by the impetuo&s;ity of tho&s;e who directed his conduct: they prevailed upon him to &s;ign orders for exacting a Benevolence, which was partly levied in the mo&s;t arbitrary manner, on pretence of recovering the Palatinate; but all of a &s;udden the collectors de&s;i&s;ted; and James convoked a parliament, to which Buckingham thought he &s;hould recommend him&s;elf effectually by his having broke off the Spani&s;h match, an alliance &s;o di&s;agreeable to the Engli&s;h nation. In order to pave the way to this popularity, he affected to care&s;s &s;ome of the leading puritans, con&s;ulting them upon means for $e-uniting the chapter|lands to the crown; and when the parliament met, the king's &s;peech to the two hou&s;es plainly proved, that he &s;poke the &s;ugge&s;tions of a mini&s;ter, in con|tradiction to the whole tenor of his former conduct. In&s;tead of expatiating upon his prerogative, as u&s;ual, he now mode&s;tly craved their advice and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance touching his &s;on's marriage, the welfare of his daughter and family, and the general peace of Europe. He mentioned the prince's journey to Spain: which, together with all his negotiations for the match, had, as he &s;aid, proved ineffectual, from the in&s;incerity of the court of Madrid. He declared that he never de&s;igned to grant a toleration to the catholics; prote&s;ted before God, that his intention was to maintain the commons in the enjoyment of all their privileges; and conjured them again to take into immediate con&s;ideration the important &s;ubjects he had propo&s;ed. This harangue was well received by the hou&s;e, which Buckingham had filled with his creatures.</P>

<P>In a conference between the peers and commons, while the prince of Wales was pre&s;ent, the duke, in a long di&s;cour&s;e$ explained the motives of the prince's journey to Spain; the negotiation for the marriage and re&s;titution of the Palatinate, and the rea&s;ons of the prince's abrupt return. He alledged that the king had been mi&s;led by the fal&s;e reports of the earl of Bri&s;tol; that Philip never intended either to conclude the match, or intere&s;t him&s;elf in behalf of the palatine; and that the whole blame of the mi&s;carriage ought to be laid upon the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, who had abu&s;ed his maje&s;ty's confidence. For the truth of his a&s;&s;ertions he appealed to Charles, who confirmed all his alle|gations; and his &s;peech was crowned with univer&s;al applau&s;e. The Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador having complained to the king, that the duke of Buckingham &s;poke of his ma&s;ter in di&s;re&s;pectful terms, the two hou&s;es pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, declaring that the duke had &s;aid nothing which ought to give offence to the Spani&s;h monarch; and they thanked that nobleman for his candid nar|ration. As the king had not told them that the negotiation for the marriage was ab&s;olutely at an end, they drew up another addre&s;s, coun&s;elling his maje&s;ty to break off the treaty; and James, convening them in the hou&s;e of peers, declared he was ready to comply with their reque&s;t, provided they would enable him to &s;upport the war, which would infallibly en&s;ue. He even conde&s;cended &s;o far as to propo&s;e, that the &s;ub&s;idies, which they &s;hould grant, might be mana|ged by commi&s;&s;ioners appointed in parliament. They promi&s;ed to vote three whole &s;ub&s;idies and as many fifteenths on the&s;e terms; and he di&s;patched a courier to Madrid with letters, by which he formally broke off the negotiation.</P>

<P>This re&s;olution was no &s;ooner known to the people than they celebrated the rupture with bonfires and other demon&s;trations of joy. The two hou&s;es petitioned the king to execute the laws again&s;t Je&s;uits and Roman prie&s;ts; to give order for &s;eizing the arms of popi&s;h recu&s;ants, and obliging
<PB N="198" REF="2000">
them to retire from London; to revoke all licences granted to &s;uch recu&s;ants, and put a &s;top to the great concour&s;e of people who re&s;orted to ma&s;s in the chap|pels of amba&s;&s;adors; to deprive all papi&s;ts of the po&s;ts which they enjoyed; and to engage his royal word that he would not for the future &s;u&s;pend the execution of the laws again&s;t popi&s;h recu&s;ants, on any account what&s;oever. To this pe|tition the king &s;ent a very complai&s;ant an&s;wer, a&s;&s;uring them in general, that he would comply with their demands: but he artfully avoided explaining him|&s;elf touching tho&s;e articles that mentioned the removal of the papi&s;ts from London, and their being dive&s;ted of all employments. Buckingham's mother and wife, one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, and many per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;ide|rable offices, were either profe&s;&s;ed or reputed Roman catholics. The com|mons pre&s;ented a li&s;t of fifty-&s;even to the king, but he would not &s;ignify his &s;entiments on this &s;ubject; and they did not in&s;i&s;t upon &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>The marquis d'Innoio&s;a, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, incen&s;ed again&s;t Buckingham for having prevented the marriage, and treated his ma&s;ter with &s;uch di&s;re&s;pect, took an opportunity of putting a paper into the king's hand privarely; and James retired forth with into his clo&s;et, where he was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find it an accu&s;ation of the duke, dige&s;ted into different ar|ticles, calculated to alarm him with fears of per&s;onal danger. They imported, That the king was &s;urrounded by people devoted to the prince and the duke; &s;o that he could not be informed of what pa&s;&s;ed in parliament, or even in his own court; where he was in all re&s;pects as much a pri&s;oner as ever Francis I. of France was at Madrid: That the prince and Buckingham had re&s;olved to remove him from the throne; and, for that purpo&s;e, engaged him in a war, that they might have a pretext for levying troops to dethrone him: That the duke's emi&s;&s;aries endeavoured to render his maje&s;ty odious and contemptible among his &s;ubjects, and had already corrupted the parliament: That Bucking|ham had not only broke off the match, but even divulged his ma&s;ter's &s;ecrets, and exerted his utmo&s;t efforts to embroil him with the Hollanders: That he had been bribed by divers foreign amba&s;&s;adors, and put him&s;elf at the head of the puritans, though he well knew they had formed a &s;cheme for transferring the crown to the electre&s;s palatine. In the conclu&s;ion of this paper he was de&s;ired to take the opportunity of the prince's being in the hou&s;e of peers with Buckingham, to &s;end for the &s;ecretary of the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, by whom all his doubts and &s;cruples would be removed. James, alarmed with this in|formation, actually conferred in private with the &s;ecretary, and another Spa|niard, known by the name of father Mae&s;tro; and from that day became me|lancholy and di&s;tru&s;tful. He could not conceal his &s;entiments from Bucking|ham, nor forbear to exhibit marks of alienation. One day, &s;etting out with the prince for Wind&s;or, he ordered the duke to &s;tay behind, on &s;ome &s;light pretence. Buckingham, &s;hocked at this order, begged in the name of God to know what was laid to his charge; and the king pro$e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf extremely un|happy in being abandoned by tho&s;e who enjoyed the greate&s;t &s;hare of his affection. The duke $$tired to his own hou&s;e, overwhelmed with anxiety; but, by the ad|vice of the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, he &s;oon followed the king to Wind&s;or, where he found means to remove his maje&s;ty's &s;u&s;picions: or rather James di&s;&s;embled his &s;entiments, through fear of the other's re&s;entment. He longed with impa|tience for the arrival of the earl of Bri&s;tol, on who&s;e integrity and prudence he
<PB N="199" REF="2010">
could rely with the utmo&s;t confidence. Before the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the duke of Buckingham, being offended at Lionel Cranfield, earl of Middle&s;ex, and lord trea&s;urer, for having refu&s;ed to an&s;wer &s;ome demands during the prince's re&s;idence in Spain, re&s;olved to &s;hew that as he had influence enough to rai&s;e this mini&s;ter from ob&s;curity, &s;o he had power &s;ufficient left to puni&s;h his pre|&s;umption. He was, by the duke's in&s;tigation, impeached of divers mi&s;de|meanors; and though the evidence again&s;t him was extremely defective, he was condemned to pay a fine of fifty thou&s;and pounds, and rendered incapable of &s;itting in the hou&s;e of peers. When this pro&s;ecution began, the king, who looked upon Middle&s;ex as a faithful and able mini&s;ter, conjured the prince and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coke, Wil&s;on.

<P>Such was the de&s;poti&s;m exerci&s;ed over the mind of this weak prince, that when the earl of Bri&s;tol arrived at Dover, he &s;ent an order, com|manding him to confine him&s;elf within his own hou&s;e, until he &s;hould an&s;wer certain que&s;tions. After the prorogation of the parliament, that nobleman petitioned that he might be interrogated; and, by dint of repeated &s;ollicitations obtained his reque&s;t. The commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by the council for this pur|po&s;e, having examined him minutely, declared they could find nothing repre|hen&s;ible in his conduct. Neverthele&s;s, he was &s;till confined, and given to un|der&s;tand, that there was only one way to regain his maje&s;ty's favour, namely, that of owning him&s;elf guilty of certain mi&s;demeanours which were &s;pecified to him in writing. He rejected the propo&s;al with di&s;dain; and the king told Buckingham, that he exerci&s;ed a mo&s;t horrible tyranny, in compelling an inno|cent man to declare him&s;elf guilty: but, he had not intere&s;t enough to &s;creen him from oppre&s;&s;ion, or even to &s;ee him, though he ardently wi&s;hed for an op|portunity to profit by his advice. In the mean time, &s;ix thou&s;and men were &s;ent over to Holland, to &s;erve in the army of the &s;tates, under the prince of Orange; and other levies were begun for troops to join the count de Man$feldt, who intended to make an irruption into the Palatinate during the wintor.</P>

<P>Henry Rich, lately created earl of Holland, had been &s;ent am|ba&s;&s;ador to France, to &s;ound that court touching a marriage between the prince of Wales and the prince&s;s Henrietta; and the propo&s;al was agreeable to the French mini&s;try. The earl of Carli&s;le was &s;ent over to a&s;&s;i&s;t Holland in the negotiation; and the conferences were opened in Compeigne, at the very time when James, according to his promi&s;e to parliament, ordered the laws to be put in execution again&s;t popi&s;h r$cu&s;ants. The Roman catholic prie&s;ts in England implored the interce&s;&s;ion of Lewis XIII. who in compliance with their de&s;ire, di&s;patched the archbi&s;hop of Ambrun to &s;ollicit in their behalf. That prelate arrived at Roy&s;ton in di&s;gui&s;e, and had divers conferences with the king, who declared him&s;elf a friend to the catholic religion; a&s;&s;ured him that the members of that communion &s;hould not be injured under his government, and imparted a ridiculous &s;cheme for procuring a general toleration all over Chri&s;tendom. The treaty for the marriage was &s;till carried on; and, after &s;ome debates, concluded under the au&s;pices of cardinal de Richeli$$, on condition, That the prince&s;s Henrietta &s;hould enjoy all the indulgences with re&s;pect to re|ligion which had been &s;tipulated for the infanta; among other articles, That &s;he &s;hould &s;uperintend the education of her children to the age of thirteen.

<P>The earl of Carli&s;le had propo&s;ed to Lewis, a league again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and the French court not only di&s;covered an inclination to enter into &s;uch an engagement; but even promi&s;ed to join a body of troops to tho&s;e which James had undertaken to rai&s;e for the count de Mansfeldt. This great officer arrived in England, where he met with a very honourable reception; and the king agreed that he &s;hould have twelve thou&s;and men, to make a diver&s;ion in the lower Palatinate. This body being levied, James demanded of the in&s;anta I&s;abella the town of Frankendal, which was delivered into her hands, until the truce &s;hould expire; and a free pa&s;&s;age for the Eng|li&s;h garri&s;on through the dominions of Spain and its allies. That prince&s;s de|clared, &s;he would punctually comply with the articles of the treaty of London, in delivering up Frankendal, and granting a pa&s;&s;age for the Engli&s;h troops through the territories belonging to her and the king of Spain; but, that &s;he could not undertake for their pa&s;&s;ing unmole&s;ted through the dominions of the empire. Thus was the king of England over-reached in &s;uch a manner, that the treaty was rendered altogether ineffectual. When the truce expired, the governor of Frankendal marched out of the place with his garri&s;on; but as no per&s;on appeared in behalf of his Britannic maje&s;ty, he forthwith returned, and retook po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town. The troops de&s;tined for the &s;ervice of Mansfeldt were embarked in the &s;evere &s;ea&s;on of the year; and when they ar|rived at Calais, the French would not &s;uffer them to land.

James refu&s;ed to take another oath, ob&s;erving, that his word was &s;ufficient: &s;o that there was a nece&s;&s;ity for having a new di&s;pen&s;ation without this clau&s;e. But, James did not live to &s;ee the marriage take effect. About the middle of March he was &s;eized with a tertian ague, which in a few days brought him to the grave, in the fifty-ninth year of his age, after he had reigned two and twenty years in England.

Calvert lord Baltimore, who had profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Roman catholic; granted a pardon to Cranfield earl of Middle&s;ex; recalled by proclamation all the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects from the Imperial, Spani&s;h, and Flemi&s;h &s;ervices; i&s;&s;ued commi&s;&s;ions for granting letters of repri&s;al again&s;t the Spaniards, as well as for rai&s;ing ten thou&s;and men, partly for a naval expedition, and partly for the recovery of the Palatinate. The&s;e troops were &s;ent to Port&s;mouth to be em|barked, and the expence of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and cloathing was a&s;&s;igned upon different counties, to be afterwards reimbur&s;ed by the exchequer. The mar|riage of the king being celebrated by proxy at Paris, the duke of Buckingham was employed to conduct the queen to England. She arrived on the twelfth day of June at Dover, where &s;he was received by Charles, and the nuptials were con&s;ummated at Canterbury. On the &s;ixteenth day of the &s;ame month, the king and queen made their public entry into London; and on the eighteenth the parliament a&s;&s;embled. Charles, in his fir&s;t &s;peech, reminded the two hou&s;es of their having coun&s;elled his father to break off the two treaties, and employ more effectual means for the recovery of the Palatinate: he therefore expected they would &s;upport him in maintaining the war, which was the re&s;ult of their advice. He intreated them to be &s;peedy with their &s;upplies; and a&s;&s;ured them of his attachment to the prote&s;tant religion. Lord Coventry keeper of the privy seal enlarged upon the different parts of the king's &s;peech, recommended his wants to their genero&s;ity, and vouched for his maje&s;ty's affection to his par|liament and people.</P>

<P>By this time the popularity of Buckingham had vani&s;hed: the commons had di&s;covered that they were mi&s;led by his fal&s;e repre&s;entation of the Spani&s;h affair; and he no longer payed court to the puritan faction, which was now be|come extremely powerful. Under this denomination, the court affected to con&s;ider all tho&s;e leading members of the lower hou&s;e, who had a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves in a regular de&s;ign to abridge the prerogative of the crown, and a&s;certain and augment the liberties of the commons. They looked upon the hierarchy as the firm prop of monarchical power, and dete&s;ted it accordingly: they found the levelling principles of the puritans more con&s;onant to their re|publican &s;chemes: they &s;aw them numerous, wealthy, warm, enterprizing, and enthu&s;ia&s;tic; of con&s;equence, the more ea&s;ily moved and actuated by art and di&s;&s;imulation: they therefore enrolled them&s;elves as members of that party. Notwith&s;tanding the eagerne&s;s with which the king pre&s;&s;ed the commons for an immediate &s;upply, the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s upon which the par|liament proceeded, was a petition of both hou&s;es again&s;t popi&s;h recu&s;ants; and they received a gracious though a general an&s;wer. Then they &s;ummoned<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$&s;hworth.</NOTE> doctor Montague, the king's chaplain, to the bar of the hou&s;e, for having writ|ten a book, intituled, An appeal to Cae&s;ar, in which he gave it as his opinion, that a virtuous catholic might be &s;aved from eternal damnation; and &s;eemed to favour the Roman doctrine. He was remitted to the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, who contented him&s;elf with exhorting him to avoid writing on &s;uch &s;ub|jects for the future. The king was piqued at this pro&s;ecution, and evoked the cau&s;e before his own council. He could not help expre&s;&s;ing his d$&s;plea&s;ure at
<PB N="204" REF="2060">

<P>As the plague made d$eadful havock in London, the parliament was adjourned to Oxford; and in the mean time an incident happened, which &s;trongly marked the character of the Engli&s;h people at this period. James, immediately before his death, had promi&s;ed to lend the French king &s;ix &s;hips to &s;erve again&s;t the Genoe&s;e; but, Lewis XIII. re&s;olved to u&s;e them in the &s;iege of Rochelle ag$in&s;t his prote&s;tant &s;$bjects. They accordingly &s;ailed to Dieppe, under the command of Pennington; but, the captains and &s;eamen no &s;ooner under&s;tood their de&s;tination, than they weighed anchor, and returned to Eng|land. The king &s;ent a po&s;itive order to Pennington, commanding him to &s;teer his cour&s;e to Dieppe again, and deliver them into the hands of the French. The order was obeyed; but, all the men de&s;erted rather than &s;erve again&s;t the prote&s;tants of Rochelie. Yet, even the&s;e Huguenots were &s;upported by the king of Spain, and their revolt prevented Lewis from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Engli&s;h monarch in his de&s;igns again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>

<P>When the parliament a&s;&s;embled at Oxford, the hou&s;e of commons was immediately filled with complaints again&s;t the duke of Buckingham and other mini&s;ters, who had coun&s;elled the king to mi&s;apply the &s;ub&s;idies which had been granted to his father. They ob&s;erved, that no care was taken to protect the trade of the nation from pirates: that there was a powerful party in the kingdom, which openly favoured popery and Arminiani&s;m; and they again &s;ummoned Montague to the bar of the hou&s;e, where he was very &s;everely reprimanded. The king perceiving they were more intent upon the grievances of the nation, than upon the exigency of his affairs, &s;ent for both hou&s;es to the hall of Chri&s;t's college, where he again put them in mind of their promi&s;e to &s;upport the war; and a&s;&s;ured them, that the &s;upply they had voted would not be &s;ufficient to de|fray the expence of a fleet which he had actually equipped. Then one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate explained the nece&s;&s;ity of granting a much larger &s;um for the king's occa&s;ions. The commons, in&s;tead of complying with the&s;e hints, renewed their complaints again&s;t the duke of Buckingham and the favourers of popery; and Charles, in order to render them more propitious to his views, indulged them with a particular an&s;wer to every article of their former petition, granting every thing they de&s;ired. Even this conde&s;cen&s;ion failed to mollify their hearts, and open their pur&s;es. They &s;till dwelt upon the grievances of the nation, and the &s;tate of religion; and the king, incen&s;ed to &s;ee all his mea|&s;ures broken, di&s;&s;olved the parliament, on pretence of the plague's having ex|tended to Oxford. But, the commons before their di&s;&s;olution, with a view to ju&s;tify them&s;elves in the opinion of the people, drew up an artful declaration, importing, That their de&s;ign was to &s;upport his maje&s;ty in all his ju&s;t under|takings, after they &s;hould have procured redre&s;s for the grievances of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$$$worth.</NOTE> nation.</P>

<P>Charles having nothing to hope from parliament, rai&s;ed money by way of loan, extorted by orders under the privy &s;eal; and, to facilitate this expedient, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, recalling all the children of Engli&s;h parents that were in foreign &s;eminaries, as well as the &s;ubjects of Great Britain and Ireland, who were in the &s;ervice of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; while, at the &s;ame time, the privy council publi&s;hed an order for di&s;arming all popi&s;h recu&s;ants.

The fleet de&s;tined to act again&s;t Spain, con&s;i&s;ting of four&s;core &s;hips, having on board ten regiments of infantry, &s;et &s;ail in October, under the command of Ed|ward Cecil ju&s;t created vi&s;count Wirnbleton, in&s;tructed to cruize in a certain latitude, to intercept the Spani&s;h plate-fleet on its return from the We&s;t-Indies. He was di&s;appointed in his expectation; but, might have taken or de&s;troyed a great number of rich galleons and gallies lying in the bay of Cadiz, had the earl of E&s;&s;ex, who commanded the van, attacked them before they could have put them&s;elves under the cannon of Portreal, and &s;unk &s;ome ve&s;&s;els in the chan|nel to block up the pa&s;&s;age. A thou&s;and men being landed with Sir John Burgh, the fort of Puntal &s;urrendered at the fir&s;t &s;ummons. The re&s;t of the infantry were next day &s;et on &s;hore, and marched towards the bridge of Suazzo; but, being quartered in a place where there was great plenty of wine, the &s;oldiers drank it to &s;uch exce&s;s, that univer&s;al confu&s;ion en$ued; and the officers were obliged to de&s;i&s;t from their enterprize.

<P>The king's finances being quite exhau&s;ted, he publi&s;hed a proclama|tion, ordering all per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of forty pounds a year, who had not yet been knighted, to come and receive that dignity: but, reaping very little ad|vantage from this contrivance, he found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of convok|ing another parliament. In the mean time he was crowned at We&s;tmin&s;ter by the hands of Laud bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells, who approaching him as he &s;at upon his throne, pronounced an ob&s;olete addre&s;s in the Latin language, to this effect. <Q>&startq;Stand, and hold fa&s;t, from henceforth, that place of royal dignity whereof you are the lawful and undoubted heir by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from your an|ce&s;tors, and which hath been this day delivered unto you, in the name and by the authority of Almighty God, and by the hands of us the bi&s;hops and &s;er|vants of God, though unworthy; whom as you &s;ee approach nearer to God's altars, &s;o vouch&s;a&s;e the more graciou&s;ly to continue to them your royal favour and protection; and the Lord Almighty, who&s;e mini&s;ters and &s;tewards they are, e&s;tabli&s;h your throne in righteou&s;ne&s;s, that it may &s;tand fa&s;t for ever|more, like as the &s;un before him, and as the faithful witne&s;s in heaven.&endq;</Q> The revival of this invocation, which had been di&s;continued &s;ince the corona|tion of Richard II. gave great offence to the puritans, and indeed, was a very idle and un&s;ea&s;onable mark of Laud's &s;uper&s;tition.</P>

<P>The king, that he might berid of the leaders of the oppo&s;ition, appointed them as &s;heriffs of counties, &s;o that they could not &s;it in the hou&s;e of com|mons; but, this &s;cheme did not an&s;wer expectation. That &s;pirit had dif|fu&s;ed it&s;elf through the whole kingdom; and this new parliament inherited the complexion and character of the la&s;t. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened with a &s;peech<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1626.</NOTE> by the lord keeper of the privy &s;eal, who extolled the virtues of the king, and in his maje&s;ty's name recommended unanimity. He likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured them of the king's affections towards his &s;ubjects, and exhorted them to enact whole|&s;ome laws for the benefit of his people. The commons having pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, thanking him for his gracious an&s;wer to the petition de|livered by the la&s;t parliament, began to take the grievances of the people into con&s;ideration. They cho&s;e one committee for &s;ecret affairs; another to con|&s;ider of ways and means to redre&s;s the grievances; and a third to examine the

&s;tate of religion. This was their main engine, managed by the famous Pym, chairman of the com$ittee. Two books, compo&s;ed by Montague, were again brought under in&s;pection, and condemned as $rroncous, popi&s;h, and Arminian. Charles demanded a &s;ub&s;idy, and endeavoured to de&s;erve it, by ordering the judges to put the laws in executi$n again&s;t pop$$h recu&s;ants. But &s;till the com|mons continued to br$od upon the grievances: they even obliged the com|mi&s;&s;ioners, appointed by parliament for managing the &s;ub&s;idies granted in the late reign, to give an account of their admini&s;tration. Charles not only pre&s;&s;ed them to grant the &s;ub&s;idy without further delay, which might be prejudicial to his affairs; but, in a letter to the &s;peaker, he gave the members of the lower hou&s;e to under&s;tand, that he would not receive a &s;upply unle&s;s it &s;hould be proportioned to his occa&s;ions, of which that they might not plead ignorance, he &s;ignified them in five articles that accompanied the letter. The commons, &s;hocked at this peremptory me&s;&s;age, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s couched in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms, expre&s;&s;ing their hope that he would graciou&s;ly receive &s;uch information from his parliament as woul$ di&s;cover the cau&s;e of his maje&s;ty's wants as well as of the national grievances; and they prote&s;ted they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him &s;o effectually that he &s;hould find him&s;elf &s;ecure at home and formi|dable abroad. Charles, in apprehen&s;ion of their impeaching Buckingham, again&s;t whom they loudly exclaimed as the author of all the grievances, wrote a &s;econd letter to the &s;peaker, in which he plainly told them he would not &s;uffer them to proceed again&s;t any of his dome&s;tics, much le&s;s again&s;t tho&s;e who filled the fir&s;t places about his per&s;on. He &s;aid he could not comprehend their rea&s;ons for attacking the duke of Buckingham, who had been &s;o popular in the fir&s;t parlia$ent of his reign for the &s;ervice he had done the nation: he declared that the duke, in&s;tead of augmenting, had con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed his fortune; and that he had done nothing but by his ma&s;ter's expre&s;s command: he therefore de$ired they would di&s;patch the affair of the &s;upply, otherwi&s;e they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru$hworth.</NOTE> them&s;elves would be the fir&s;t &s;ufferers by their own delay. This letter produ|ced no effect: they &s;till re&s;olved to impeach Buckingham. Doctor Turner, one of the members, propo&s;ed the que&s;tion, whether or not they might proceed again&s;t the duke upon public report? and it was decided in the affirmative. The king demanded that Turner &s;hould be puni&s;hed for his pre&s;umption; but the me&s;&s;age was di&s;regarded: neverthele&s;s they voted three &s;ub&s;idies and three fifteenths; but re&s;olved that the bill &s;hould not pa&s;s until their grievances were redre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>Charles, impatient of their proceedings, convoked both hou&s;es at Whitehall, where he thanked the lords for their loyalty and moderation; but told the commons he had &s;ent for them to convince them of their having acted contrary to the con&s;titution of the kingdom. Then the lord privy &s;eal, ha|ranguing them in his maje&s;ty's name, ob&s;erved that as no prince was more attached to the lawful u&s;e of parliaments than their &s;overeign, &s;o no king was more jealous of his prerogative, which he would not &s;uffer to be violated un|der the pretext of parliamentary freedom. He complained that Mr. Cook and doctor Turner had &s;poke &s;editiou&s;ly in their hou&s;e, with a view to defame and bring his government into contempt; and that his maje&s;ty's me&s;&s;ages, demand|ing that the&s;e members &s;hould be puni&s;hed for their in&s;olence, had been di&s;re|garded. He exculpated the conduct of the duke of Buckingham, on the te&s;ti|mony
<PB N="207" REF="2090">
of the king him&s;elf; and in&s;i&s;ted upon their de&s;i&s;ting from &s;uch irregular informations. He complained that raw members, without age, education, and experience, had pre&s;umed to vilify his council of &s;tate: that they had &s;poken of affairs in &s;uch a manner as to prejudice his negotiations with foreign powers: that their committees had not only examined the letters of his &s;ecretaries as well as his own, but even ordered the clerks of the office to produce memorials and &s;ecret notes made for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. He declared that the &s;upplies they had voted were altogether in&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es to which they were de|&s;tined; and commanded them to let him know, by Saturday next, what &s;um they would add to the &s;ub&s;idies already granted; giving them to under&s;tand, that &s;hould they fail in voting &s;uch an aid as would be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer his exigencies, he would not promi&s;e to keep them longer a&s;&s;embled; whereas, by complying with his de&s;ire, they would obtain his con&s;ent to &s;it as long as the &s;ea&s;on would permit$ The lord privy &s;eal having concluded his &s;peech, the king him&s;elf reminded them of the two treatles which had been broken off by the expre&s;s advice of parliament. He ob&s;erved that Mr. Cook had &s;aid, it was better to be devoured by foreigners, than to be ruined by impo&s;itions at home; but, for his part, he thought it was more honourable for a &s;overeign to be ruined by foreign enemies, than to fall under the contempt of his own &s;ub|jects: and he told them, that as it was his undoubted prerogative to a&s;&s;emble and di&s;&s;olve parliaments, it would depend on their behaviour, whether they &s;hould continue or cea&s;e. As &s;oon as the commons returned to their hou&s;e they ordered the doors to be &s;hut, and the keys to be laid on the table, that no member might retire until they &s;hould have deliberated upon the king's de|claration.</P>

The duke &s;ignified the rea&s;ons that induced his maje&s;ty to be &s;o importunate for a &s;upply; and a&s;&s;ured them he had no intention to interrup$ their proceedings upon the grievances of the nation. He took this opportu|nity to ju&s;tify his own conduct and magnify his &s;ervices; and the lord Con|way, &s;ecretary o$ &s;tate, attempted to demon&s;trate that the &s;ub&s;idies had been employed according to the intention of parliament. Though the commons were in &s;ome mea&s;ure appea&s;ed by this in&s;tance of the king's conde&s;cen&s;ion, they pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance, vindi$ating them&s;elves from the charge of ir|regularity and pre&s;umption; repre&s;enting that it was the undoubted privilege of parliament to deliberate upon national grievances; and humbly intreating that he would not take notice of any thing that might be &s;aid in the freedom of their debates, but &s;u&s;pend his judgment until he &s;hould &s;ee their re&s;olutions. The king, being extremely embarra&s;&s;ed for want of money, and fore&s;eeing that the commons would not deliberate upon that article until they &s;hould $e &s;atis|fied in the other, at length con&s;ented to their impeaching the duke of Buck|ingham.</P>

<P>Their proceedings on this &s;ubject were retarded by an unexpected inci|dent.

intercede with his maje&s;ty, that he might enjoy his privilege as a peer of the realm. The lords addre&s;&s;ed the king on this &s;ubject, and he complied with their reque&s;t; but at the &s;ame time the keeper of the privy &s;eal wrote to Bri&s;|tol, in the king's name, de&s;iring he would not obey the writ of &s;ummons. This letter the earl pre&s;ented, with a &s;econd petition, to the hou&s;e of peers, de&s;iring their permi&s;&s;ion to exhibit articles of accu&s;ation again&s;t the duke of Bucking|ham, who (he a$firmed) had abu&s;ed the late king as well as his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, the nation, and the parliament. Charles, incen&s;ed at his pre&s;umption, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the lords, declaring he intended to impeach the earl of Bri&s;tol of high trea&s;on. That nobleman was immediately taken into cu&s;tody, and brought to the bar of the hou&s;e, where the &s;olicitor-general read the articles of accu|&s;ation, in the name of the king, who had corrected them with his own hand. At the &s;ame time the hou&s;e received the earl's impeachment of Buckingham, and lord Conway, &s;ecretary of &s;tate. The king's accu&s;ation of Bri&s;tol was di|vided into three parts, including his conduct before his emba&s;&s;y to Spain, his behaviour during that emba&s;&s;y, and his demeanour &s;ince his return to England: but he acquitted him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as reflected very little honour on his accu&s;ers.</P>

<P>In a few days after this trial, the commons prepared articles of im|peachment again&s;t the duke of Buckingham; and Sir Dudley Diggs accu&s;ed him in the hou&s;e of peers of malver&s;ations, mi&s;pri&s;ions of trea&s;on, and divers other crimes and offences, &s;pecified in thirteen articles, which amounted to nothing more than the practice of buying and &s;elling places of honour and profit; to his having in one in&s;tance extorted money from the Ea&s;t-India company; and admini&s;tered a plai&s;ter and medicines to the late king in his la&s;t illne&s;s, without the knowledge of the phy&s;icians. The charge was &s;upported by Sir John Elliot, who exaggerated every circum&s;tance of the impeachment, and &s;poke with great virulence and contempt of Buckingham. He and Diggs were next day committed pri&s;oners to the Tower; and the king was &s;o imprudent as to declare, in the hou&s;e of lords, that he him&s;elf would be an evidence to clear the duke of every article in the impeachment. The commons, exa&s;perated at the impri&s;onment of their members, on pretence of their having &s;poken di&s;re&s;pect|fully of the king, &s;igned a prote&s;t, importing, That Sir Dudley Diggs had not &s;poken the words of which he was accu&s;ed; and they publicly declared, that neither he nor Elliot had exceeded their commi&s;&s;ion. The king, who had hoped to intimidate the hou&s;e, finding him&s;elf di&s;appointed, thought proper to relea&s;e the members; and the hou&s;e of peers pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, de&s;iring that he would al&s;o &s;et at liberty the earl of Arundel, who had been taken into cu&s;tody for the &s;ame offence. The king was very unwilling to comply with their reque&s;t; but, they repeating their demand, and in&s;i&s;ting upon the com|mitment's being a breach of privilege, he con&s;ented to the earl's di&s;charge, though not without great reluctance.</P>

<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions, the office of chancellor in the uni|ver&s;ity of Cambridge becoming vacant by the death of the earl of Suffolk, the duke of Buckingham was, by the king's intere&s;t, cho&s;en his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; a cir|cum&s;tance that gave great offence to the commons, who ju&s;tly complained of his being elected at a time when his impeachment was depending, and the plu|rality of his places formed one article of his accu&s;ation. It was certainly a
<PB N="209" REF="2110">
very impolitic mar$ of the king's contempt of his accu&s;ers. At length the duke delivered his an&s;wer to the impeachment, of which the commons demanded a copy: but Charles, in order to divert their attention from this object, wrote a letter to the &s;peaker, in&s;i&s;ting upon their pa&s;&s;ing the bill for the &s;ub&s;idy, with|out any condition, before the end of next week; otherwi&s;e he &s;hould be obli|ged to take other mea&s;ures, as his occa&s;ions were too importunate to admit of the lea&s;t delay. The lower hou&s;e, in&s;tead of obeying this command, &s;ent up a petition again&s;t popi&s;h recu&s;ants, containing a li&s;t of nine and fifty profe&s;&s;ed or reputed papi&s;ts, who enjoyed offices under the government. They after|wards demanded an audience of the king, to whom the &s;peaker delivered a declaration, ju&s;tifying their conduct, and a petition reque&s;ting that the duke of Buckingham might be removed from his maje&s;ty's councils and per&s;on. Charles, &s;hocked at the nature and freedom of this addre&s;s, re&s;olved to di&s;mi&s;s the parliament; and the commons, receiving intimation of his de&s;ign, drew up a remon&s;trance, of which every member was furni&s;hed with a copy. The lords, apprized of the king's re&s;olution, attempted by an addre&s;s to divert him from his purpo&s;e, which however he executed by an immediate di&s;&s;olution of the parliament. In the remon&s;trance, which was chiefly levelled again&s;t the duke of Buckingham, the commons complained of the di&s;&s;olution of the former parliaments: Of the king's hinting a de&s;ign of laying them intirely a&s;ide: Of his having levied the tax of tonnage and poundage, which had expired with his father, without being renewed by the commons. They conjured him to give up the duke to the ju&s;tice of the nation, and remove him intirely from his councils; otherwi&s;e all the money they could grant would, by his mi&s;application, redound to the prejudice of the kingdom. Charles publi&s;hed a declaration to ju&s;tify the di&s;&s;olution: he alledged that, by means of &s;ome turbulent &s;pirits in the lower hou&s;e, the commons, in&s;tead of enabling him to &s;upport the war in which he was engaged by the council of parliament, di&s;regarded all his letters and me&s;|&s;ages touching the nece&s;&s;ity of a pre&s;ent &s;upply, employing their whole at|tention in pro&s;ecuting his innocent &s;ervants, and endeavouring to intrench upon his prerogative.</P>

<P>Charles inherited all his father's &s;ublime notions of the kingly power, and entertained a contempt for the commons which James would never venture to avow. His temper was more inflexible, his mind more re&s;olute than that of his father; and he thought his glory, his duty to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, was inte|re&s;ted in oppo&s;ing and preventing the encroachments of the parliament. He now i&s;&s;ued a proclamation for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the remon&s;trance; and another for|bidding all di&s;putes for or again&s;t Arminiani&s;m: then he ordered the attorney|general to pre&s;ent an information again&s;t Buckingham in the Star-chamber, for having admini&s;tered medicines to the late king; but this cau&s;e was never de|cided. In order to &s;upply the want of parliamentary &s;ub&s;idies, he e&s;tabli&s;hed a commi&s;&s;ion for compounding with popi&s;h recu&s;ants. He renewed all the lea|&s;es of the crown tenants; he borrowed a certain &s;um from every peer; and de|manded of the city of London a loan of one hundred thou&s;and pounds, which was refu&s;ed. He laid a tax upon the &s;ea-ports, for equipping a fleet to protect the trade of the nation; and he continued to exact the tonnage and poundage. He declared the kingdom was threatened with an inva&s;ion; ordained a fa&s;t to avert the judgments of God; and rai&s;ed a body of troops, on pretence of defend|ing the nation. On the twenty-&s;eventh day of Augu&s;t, his uncle, the king of
<PB N="210" REF="2120">
Denmark, whom he had engaged in the alliance again&s;t the emperor, was totally defeated by the count de Ti$$y, who took all his baggage and artillery; and Charles was obliged to find money to repair this di&s;a&s;ter. For this purpo&s;e $e could devi&s;e no exped$$$t &s;o $ea&s;ible as that of a general loan: commi&s;&s;ioners were immediately appointed and &s;ent into the different counties, with in&s;truc|t$ons to demand a certain &s;um from each individual, according to his e&s;tate; to examine upon oath tho&s;e who &s;hould refu&s;e to comply, that it might be known, whether or not any per&s;on or per&s;ons had tampered with them, to excu&s;e them&s;elves from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the king in his nece&s;&s;ities; and to tran&s;mit to the council the names, quality, and places of habitation of tho&s;e who &s;hould prove refractory. A li&s;t of the voluntary &s;ub&s;cribers was pub$$&s;$ed, with a view to influence others by their example: all the nobility and per&s;ons of fortune were ordered to remain at their country-hou&s;es, until the &s;ub&s;cription &s;hould be fini&s;hed; and, with a view to intimi|date the &s;ubjects from a refu&s;al, Sir Randolph Crew, the lord chief ju&s;tice, was dive&s;ted of his office, becau&s;e he had expre&s;&s;ed a di&s;like to this impo&s;ition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$$$$orth.</NOTE> Over and above this in&s;tance of &s;everity, &s;oldiers were quartered upon the hou&s;es of tho&s;e who were backward in their contributions; and when they were in&s;ulted or injured by tho&s;e trouble&s;ome gue&s;ts, they could not appeal to the ordinary courts of ju&s;tice, but were obliged to crave redre&s;s from a council of war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 16$$.</NOTE> which the king had in&s;tituted for the regulation of the army. Notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e precautions the money came &s;o &s;lowly into the exchequer, that the council thought proper to u&s;e more violent methods. Tho&s;e trade&s;men and burghers, who rejected the loan, were enli&s;ted as &s;oldiers; and per&s;ons of a higher rank were, upon their &s;econd refu&s;al, &s;ent as exiles into tho&s;e counties that were at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from the places of their habitation: nay, &s;uch as ref$&s;ed to &s;ubmit to this &s;entence, were impri&s;oned in London. Ve|nal clergymen were employed to preach up pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;t|ance. Sibthorp, declared from the pulpit, that &s;ubjects were puni&s;hable for refu&s;ing to obey the commands of their &s;overeign, even though the&s;e com|mands &s;hould be contrary to the laws of God, of nature, and of the nation. Manwaring affirmed, that the king was not obliged to ob&s;erve the laws of the kingdom; but that &s;ubjects were bound in con&s;cience to obey him, without re&s;triction, on pain of eternal damnation. Abbot archbi&s;hop of Canterbury was &s;u&s;pended from all his archiepi&s;copal functions, and confined to his country hou&s;e, for having refu&s;ed to licen&s;e Sibthorpe's &s;ermon. Manwaring, being in the following parliament condemned by the hou&s;e of lords to pay a fine of a thou&s;and pounds, to make public recantation at the bars of both hou&s;es, to be impri&s;oned, &s;u&s;pended, and declared incapable of any employment civil or<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ R$$$$orth.</NOTE> eccle&s;ia&s;tical, was neverthele&s;s pardoned by the king, and in the &s;equel promo|ted to a bi&s;hopric.</P>

<P>Such conduct could not fail to rai&s;e a ferment in the nation; and the only pro&s;pects the king could have of freeing him&s;elf from all his troubles, were a &s;peedy peace with Spain, and an hearty reconciliation with the com|mons. He was extremely aver&s;e to both the&s;e mea&s;ures. He had not yet grati|fied Buckingham's revenge again&s;t the count de Olivarez; and he him&s;elf deeply re&s;ented the in&s;olence of the lower hou&s;e, which had taken &s;uch unpre|cedented liberties with his prerogative and admini&s;tration. One would imagine h$s $$vourite had been be$t upon his r$in. In&s;tead of di&s;engaging him from
<PB N="211" REF="2130">
the de&s;tructive war in which he was already involved, he intailed upon him another enemy &s;till more formidable than the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Buckingham, in his emba&s;&s;y to Paris, had a&s;pired in his gallantry even to the per&s;on of the queen of France, Anne of Au&s;tria wife of Lewis XIII. He is &s;aid to have made an impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of that prince&s;s, and incurred the jealou&s;y of cardinal de Richelieu, who took immediate &s;teps for preventing the pro&s;ecution of his amour, and laid &s;nares for the life of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter. The duke being apprized of his de&s;igns, denounced vengeance again&s;t the cardinal; and at his return to England in&s;tigated his &s;overeign to declare war again&s;t France. Such at lea&s;t was the &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e of this rupture; and Buckingham was of a di&s;po&s;ition very apt to be influenced by motives of this nature. The queen's chaplains and dome&s;tics were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, in open violation of the marriage-con|tract. The duke imagined this affront would incite the French king to com|mit ho&s;tilities: but, that monarch contented him&s;elf with remon&s;trating again&s;t the contravention of the treaty. At length a pretext was found by the mini|&s;ter. Charles declared in council his re&s;olution to engage in a war with France, becau&s;e that court had refu&s;ed to grant a pa&s;&s;age to the Engli&s;h troops under the count of Mansfeldt: becau&s;e it oppre&s;&s;ed the Huguenots; and the French fleet had made prize of &s;ome Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els. Mon&s;ieur de Soubize, brother to the duke de Rohan, &s;ollicited &s;uccours for the inhabitants of Rochelle, who were threatened with a &s;iege; and a &s;trong armament being equipped for that &s;er|vice, the duke of Buckingham, as admiral and commander in chief, &s;et &s;ail from Port&s;mouth in the beginning of July.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XV.</HEAD>
<P>The Rochellers, who had received no previous hint of this expedi|tion, refu&s;ed to admit the Engli&s;h &s;uccours into their town, on pretence that they could not take &s;uch a material re&s;olution without the concurrence of the other prote&s;tants with whom they were a&s;&s;ociated; but, in reality, they were afraid of their allies, &s;u&s;pecting that Soubize and Blancard, who managed their affairs at the court of Charles, had agreed to betray the place into the hands of the Engli&s;h. Buckingham thus di&s;appointed, &s;teered his cour&s;e to the I&s;le of Rh&eacute;, and landing with &s;even thou&s;and men, obliged Toiras the French officer, who commanded in that place, to retire into the $ort of St. Martin. Had this been immediately attacked, in all probability he would have been forced to &s;urrender: but, the duke being totally ignorant of the art of war, gave him time to provide for his defence; and the &s;iege was undertaken in form. The French court no &s;ooner heard of this inva&s;ion, than the count de Schomberg was di&s;|patched with &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and men to the I&s;le of Rh&eacute;, which he entered without oppo&s;ition from the Engli&s;h navy; and obliged Buckingham to rai&s;e the &s;iege with &s;uch precipitation, that two thirds of his army were cut in pieces before he could reimbark, though he him&s;elf was the la&s;t man that quited the &s;hore. This proof of his per&s;onal courage, however, was but a &s;mall &s;ubject of con&s;olation for the di&s;grace and di&s;a&s;ter which his country &s;u&s;tained from his mi&s;conduct; and for the hatred and cur&s;es of his fellow-&s;ubjects.</P>

<P>Charles not yet di&s;couraged by this mi&s;carriage, re&s;olved to renew his efforts again&s;t France; and the inhabitants of Rochelle finding them&s;elves on the eve of a &s;iege craved &s;uccours with the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;ollicitations. The<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon. Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> king propo&s;ed to comply with their reque&s;t; but, his finances were altogether $word$ and almo&s;t all his mariners and &s;oldiers had de&s;erted the &s;ervice for want of pay. He had exerci&s;ed &s;uch acts of &s;evelity upon tho&s;e who refu&s;ed the
<PB N="212" REF="2140">
loan, that he had nothing to expect from a parliament but the mo&s;t vigorous oppo&s;ition. Sir John Elliot had pre&s;ented a petition to the king, demanding his enlargement; but, no regard was payed to his remon&s;trance. Five other gentlemen, impri&s;oned for the &s;ame refu&s;al, made the like demand, not as a fa|vour, but as the privilege of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects; no cau&s;e having been a&s;&s;igned for their commitment. This affair was brought to a &s;olemn trial before all the judges of the realm, who refu&s;ed to admit them to bail by virtue of a Habeas corpus, and remanded them to pri&s;on. After the&s;e acts of arbitrary power, Charles had very little rea&s;on to hope for conde&s;cen&s;ion in the parliament. Ne|verthele&s;s, &s;uch was the emergency of his affairs, that by the advice of Sir Ro|bert Cotton, he i&s;&s;ued out writs for convoking that a&s;&s;embly. He recalled archbi$hop Abbot from his country-hou&s;e, to which he had been confined; re|lea&s;ed the bi&s;hop of Lincoln, and the earl of Bri&s;tol; and &s;et at liberty all tho&s;e who were impri&s;oned on account of the loan, to the number of &s;even and twenty. The majority of the&s;e were returned as members of the new parlia|ment, which met about the middle of March.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 162$.</NOTE> The king, in his fir&s;t &s;peech to both hou&s;es, told them that they were convoked on purpo&s;e to grant the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies; and, that &s;hould they neglect to contribute what was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of the &s;tate, he &s;hould, in di&s;charge of his con&s;cience, u&s;e tho&s;e means that God had put into his hands, for &s;aving that which the folly of certain per&s;ons would otherwi&s;e endanger. The lord-keeper, as u&s;ual, enlarged upon the king's text. He explained the &s;ituation of all the European powers; expatiated upon the ambition of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, the perfidy of the French court, and the danger to which the Briti&s;h dominions were expo&s;ed from &s;uch formidable adver&s;aries. He exag|gerated the wants and extolled the merits of his maje&s;ty. He repeated the ri|diculous plea of the war's having been originally undertaken by advice of par|liament. He reminded them of the king's threats, in ca&s;e of their di&s;obedience; and conjured them to be neither tardy nor &s;paring in their &s;upplies. The com|mons began, as in the la&s;t parliament, with the grievances of the nation, par|ticularly the practice of billeting &s;oldiers, extorting loans, impri&s;oning tho&s;e that refu&s;ed to lend, and rejecting the privilege of the Habeas corpus, by which the Engli&s;h &s;ubject is admitted to bail. Sir Francis Seymour, Sir Thomas Wentworth afterwards earl of Strafford, Sir Robert Philips, and Sir Edward Coke, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves on this occa&s;ion by the freedom of their reflec|tions. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, among other expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame nature, &s;aid, <Q>&startq;How can we expre&s;s our affections while we retain our fears; or &s;peak of giving, till we know whether we have any thing to give?&endq;</Q> Wentworth ex|claimed, <Q>&startq;They have taken from us, what &s;hall I &s;ay? indeed, what have they left us? by tearing up the roots of all property, they have taken from us all means of &s;upplying the king; and of ingratiating our&s;elves by volun|tary proofs of duty and attachment.&endq;</Q> <Q>&startq;O improvident ance&s;tors! $cried Philips$ O unwi&s;e forfathers! to be &s;o curious in providing for the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our lands, and the liberties of parliament; and at the &s;ame time to neglect our per&s;onal liberty, and let us lie in pri&s;on during plea&s;ure, without redre&s;s or remedy? If this be law, why do we talk of liberties? why trouble our&s;elves with di&s;putes about a con&s;titution, franchi&s;es, and property? what may any man call his own, if not the liberty of his per&s;on?&endq;</Q> Sir Ed|ward

Coke quoted &s;tatutes to prove the king had no power to levy taxes by ex|torted loans; and he repeated an article of the great charter, importing, That no freeman &s;hall be arre&s;ted, impri&s;oned, or di&s;&s;ei&s;ed of his freehold, except by the legal judgment of his peers, or by an expre&s;s law of the land. In vain did the parti&s;ans of the court endeavour to molli&s;y tho&s;e demagogues, and per&s;uade them to begin with a &s;upply. In vain did &s;ecretary Cook pre&s;ent certain propo|&s;itions from the king: the hou&s;e refu&s;ed to hear them, till they &s;hould have di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject of grievances. In oppo&s;ition to the king's preten&s;ions, and to the determination of the judges, they voted, That no &s;ubject &s;hould be impri&s;oned or arre&s;ted without cau&s;e &s;hewn; and, That the pri&s;oner &s;hould enjoy the privi|lege of the Habeas corpus, even tho' committed by order of the king or council: Thatevery freeman has, by antient and indubitable right, the ab&s;olute and intire property of his own e&s;tate: and, That no tax, talliage, loan, or benevolence, can be impo&s;ed by any other authority than of parliament. Then they allowed the &s;ecretary to read the king's propo&s;itions, demanding, That they would equip thirty &s;hips for the defence of the coa&s;ts: ten for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Rochelle, and the like number to guard the Elbe, the Sound, and the Baltick: that they would provide for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of eleven thou&s;and men de&s;tined for an expe|dition abroad; and for &s;ix thou&s;and to be &s;ent as auxiliaries to the king of Den|mark: that they would furni&s;h the forts and magazines with nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores and ammunition: to cau&s;e twenty &s;hips to be yearly built as a reinforcement to the navy; repair the fortified places, pay the arrears due to the train of artillery, the Victualling-office, the fleet, and the merchants, who&s;e ve&s;&s;els had been employed in the &s;ervice: and la&s;tly, form a magazine for the land|forces.</P>

<P>The commons, without entering into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of particular ar|ticles, re&s;olved to grant a powerful &s;upply; and then re&s;umed the con&s;ideration of grievances. As the council had confined to their own hou&s;es &s;everal indivi|duals who refu&s;ed the loan, and &s;ent others to &s;erve abroad in the army, the hou&s;e re&s;olved that no free &s;ubject could be arre&s;ted or exiled to any place what&s;oever, by order of the king and council, without the concurring autho|rity of the laws of the land, or act of parliament. The king beginning to be apprehen&s;ive of this &s;pirit in the commons, &s;ent &s;ecretary Cook with two &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive &s;oothing me&s;&s;ages, in con&s;equence of which they re&s;olved to grant five &s;ub&s;idies; but, immediately returned to the old &s;ubject, and demanded a con|ference with the upper hou&s;e. Charles &s;till pre&s;&s;ed the affair of the &s;ub&s;idies, in repeated me&s;&s;ages mixed with threats; and the court members endeavoured to inti|midate the oppo&s;ition, by hinting the danger of the king's being induced to govern altogether without parliaments. The commons were alarmed, not affrighted. They pre&s;ented a petition again&s;t the new method of quartering &s;oldiers in pri|vate hou&s;es; but, in&s;tead of an&s;wering it, he exhorted them to proceed with|out lo&s;s of time upon the &s;upply. Their ob&s;tinacy increa&s;ed in proportion to his impatience. They determined to &s;ell their &s;ub&s;idies for &s;ome valuable con|&s;ideration. They prepared another remon&s;trance, intituled, The petition of right, in order to a&s;certain the liberties of the &s;ubject; and &s;ent it up to the lords for their peru&s;al and concurrence. The upper hou&s;e propo&s;ed &s;ome alterations, which the other ab&s;olutely rejected.</P>

<P>The king &s;ummoned the lords and commons to Whitehall, where the lord-keeper, in his name, told them, That his maje&s;ty looked upon the great charter, and the &s;ix explanatory &s;tatutes, as unalterable con&s;titutions actually in force: That he would maintain his &s;ubjects in the liberty of their per&s;ons and e&s;tates: and, That he would govern according to the laws and &s;tatutes of the realm. He a&s;&s;ured them they would find as much &s;ecurity in his royal word and promi&s;e, as in any &s;tatute they could enact; and de&s;ired they would unanimou&s;ly concur in di&s;paching the principal affair. The commons were not plea&s;ed with this declaration, which they con&s;idered as a &s;ubterfuge to elude their intention. Sir Thomas Wentworth ob&s;erved, that they mu&s;t not only be &s;atisfied them&s;elves, but al&s;o do &s;omething for the &s;atisfaction of po&s;te|rity; and, that as their laws and liberties had been publicly violated, it was nece&s;&s;ary to demand a public reparation. They were again importuned by me&s;&s;ages, and given to under&s;tand that the &s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hould not continue a fortnight longer. They &s;till &s;tood firm to their purpo&s;e. The &s;peaker, in his addre&s;s of thinks to the king for his having declared his intention to rule according to law, de&s;ired to know if he would give his royal a&s;&s;ent to a bill for the &s;ecurity of their rights and privileges. The lord keeper an&s;wered, in the king's name, That his maje&s;ty's word was better than a bill, which, however, they might pre|pare, for confirming the great charter and the &s;ix &s;tatutes; but without expla|nation, addition, or paraphra&s;e. The petition beng drawn up, the commons fixed the time for the payment of the &s;ub&s;idies, that the king might have no cau&s;e to complain of their backwardne&s;s on that &s;ubject; and that &s;ame day &s;ent the petition to the upper hou&s;e, demanding the concurrence of the lords. In a conference between the two hou&s;es, the lord keeper produced a letter from the king to the peers, declaring his re&s;olution to forbear for the future from im|pri&s;oning any per&s;on on account of his refu&s;ing to lend money, or for any other cau&s;e that did not immediately affect the public weal. He likewi&s;e promi&s;ed that the cau&s;e of impri&s;onment &s;hould be always &s;pecified; and the party ad|mitted to bail, according to the laws of the kingdom. As the lower hou&s;e took no notice of this letter, the lords propo&s;ed an additional clau&s;e to the pe|tition; but the commons rejecting it, they did not in&s;i&s;t upon its being admit|ted. Then the two hou&s;es re&s;olved to pre&s;ent the petition, and be&s;eech his maje&s;ty to vouch&s;afe an an&s;wer in full parliament, that it might be regi&s;tered as a fundamental con&s;titution. It contained an enumeration of the &s;tatutes which had been lately violated; and an humble prayer, That no man for the future &s;hould be compelled to yield any gift, loan, benevolence, or tax, without an act of parliament: That none &s;hould be confined, mole&s;ted, or di&s;quieted for the refu&s;al thereof: That his maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to remove the &s;ol|diers and mariners who were quartered upon private per&s;ons,; and never lay &s;een burdens on his people in time to come: That the commi&s;&s;ions for pro|ceeding by martial law might be revoked and annulled; and no &s;uch commi&s;|&s;ions be i&s;&s;ued for the future. The&s;e they demanded as their rights and liber|ties, according to the laws and &s;tatutes of the realm; be&s;eeching his maje&s;ty to declare, that the proceedings to the prejudice of his people in any of the pre|mi&s;&s;es, &s;hould not be drawn into con&s;equence or example; and, that he would, for the further comfort and &s;afety of his people, declare, That all his officers and
<PB N="215" REF="2170">
mini&s;ters &s;hould &s;erve him according to the laws and &s;tatutes of the realm, as they tendered the honour of his maje&s;ty, and the pro&s;perity of the kingdom. This petition being read before the king, his an&s;wer was in the&s;e words.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> <Q>&startq;The king willeth that right be done, according to the laws and cu&s;toms of the realm: and, that the &s;tatutes be put in due execution: that his &s;ubjects may have no cau&s;e to complain of any wrong or oppre&s;&s;ion, contrary to their ju&s;t rights and liberties, to the pre&s;ervation whereof he holds him&s;elf in con|&s;cience as much obliged, as of his own prerogative.&endq;</Q> The commons, di&s;&s;a|tisfied with this vague and eva&s;ive reply, laid a&s;ide the bill of &s;ub&s;idies, and brought the &s;ubject of grievances again upon the carpet. It was at this junc|ture that they pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence upon doctor Manwaring, as we have ob&s;erved above. The king having &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the commons, importing, that he would make no alteration in his an&s;wer, and fini&s;h the &s;e&s;&s;ion in a few days; they took it for granted that Buckingham had done them ill offices. Sir John Elliot ri&s;ing up to &s;peak, was &s;ilenced by the &s;peaker, who declared he had the king's particular order for that purpo&s;e. The hou&s;e immediately drew up the following declaration: <Q>&startq;That &s;ince the beginning of this parliament, no mem|ber had failed in point of re&s;pect to his maje&s;ty.&endq;</Q> Then they decreed, in a committee of the whole hou&s;e, that no member &s;hould retire, on pain of being committed to the Tower. The &s;peaker, however, being permitted to with|draw, went immediately to the king, and informed him of the&s;e proceedings. Mean while they deliberated upon a remon&s;trance to his maje&s;ty, in which the duke of Buckingham &s;hould be accu&s;ed as the principal cau&s;e of all the mis|fortunes of the nation. The keeper returned with the king's order to adjourn till next day, when he delivered another me&s;&s;age, &s;ignifying, That his maje&s;ty had no intention to deprive them of their ju&s;t rights, but only to prevent their blaming his council, his pa&s;t conduct, and his mini&s;ters. He de&s;ired they would not proceed upon bu&s;ine&s;s which would require more time than he had allotted; and promi&s;ed that &s;hould he and they part in good under&s;tanding, he would &s;oon call them together again, when they might con&s;ider other affairs at their lei&s;ure. Without regarding his promi&s;e or reque&s;t, they proceeded with the remon&s;trance, and demanded the concurrence of the lords, in be&s;eeching his maje&s;ty to give a more clear and &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to the petition of right. Charles, thus &s;ollicited by both hou&s;es, thought proper to comply with their reque&s;t; and the petition of right being read again in his hearing, he pro|nounced the u&s;ual form of a&s;&s;ent, "Let it be right, as is de&s;ired." This con|ce&s;&s;ion was received with loud acclamations and public rejoicings; and the com|mons could no longer delay the bill of &s;ub&s;idies, which was pa&s;&s;ed immediately. Yet their ill humour did not abate.</P>

<P>If, on one hand, Charles has been taxed with having formed a de&s;ign to render him&s;elf ab&s;olute; it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be owned, that the leaders of this parliament &s;eemed bent upon infinging and reducing his undoubted preroga|tive. This confirmation of their rights and privileges was &s;o well received in all parts of the kingdom, that the demagogues began to fear the king would become popular. They therefore re&s;olved to fini&s;h the remon&s;trance, and in&s;ert in it every &s;hadow or &s;u&s;picion of a grievance, which might help to in&s;pire the &s;ubject with hatred and contempt of his &s;overeign. They di&s;covered an order
<PB N="216" REF="2180">
of the king for the payment of thirty thou&s;and pounds to Sir William Balfour, and Sir John Dolbeir, who had rai&s;ed a body of German cavalry to be tran&s;|ported into England. They examined a commi&s;&s;ion granted to certain per&s;ons, impowering them to devi&s;e ways and means for rai&s;ing money, either by im|po&s;ition on the people, or otherwi&s;e. They &s;et on foot an inquiry into the conduct of the duke of Buckingham; and they had recour&s;e to the article of religion, as the mo&s;t inflammatory ingredient that could be mingled in their remon&s;trance. They re&s;olved, That the duke of Buckingham was the cau&s;e of all the national di&s;a&s;ters, including the growth of popery: and, That Neale and Laud, bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter and Bath, were the protectors of Arminiani&s;m. All the&s;e circum&s;tances were in&s;erted in the remon&s;trance, together with a mi|nute recapitulation of all the mi&s;carriages by &s;ea and land; and every in&s;tance of arbitrary exaction and mi&s;conduct, which they imputed to the evil coun&s;els of the duke of Buckingham. The king received this addre&s;s with the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible chagrin; and afterwards gave the lower hou&s;e to under&s;tand, that he would put an end to the &s;e&s;&s;ion on the twenty-&s;ixth day of the month. The commons forthwith began to prepare another remon&s;trance again&s;t the king's levying the duties of tonnage and poundage, without con&s;ent of parliament. They repre&s;ented, That this impo&s;ition was of the nature of other &s;ub&s;idies granted by the commons; an hereditary right inherent in the &s;ubjects, founded upon the antient and original con&s;titution of the kingdom, confirmed by divers &s;tatutes. They declared, That the exaction of tho&s;e duties upon merchandize, or any other tax, without the con&s;ent of parliament, was a violation of the funda|mental liberties of the kingdom, and incongruous with his maje&s;ty's an&s;wer to the petition of right. The king being made acquainted with the purport of this &s;econd remon&s;trance, repaired to the hou&s;e of peers, and &s;ent for the com|mons. He reminded both hou&s;es of their having prote&s;ted, in their petition of right, that they had no intention to encroach upon his prerogative, which was not indeed in their power. He now declared, That in his an&s;wer to the peti|tion, he did not mean to grant any new $word$ to his people: nor would he part with the tonnage and poundage, which was one of the chief &s;upports of his crown. Then he gave his a&s;&s;ent to the b$$l of &s;ub&s;idies, and prorogued the par|liament<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> to the twentieth day of October.</P>

<P>After their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, he recalled the copies of Manwaring's &s;ermon, which had given &s;uch offence, and ordered &s;ome Je&s;uits to be impri&s;oned; but, on the other hand, he e&s;tabli&s;hed a commi&s;&s;ion for compounding with popi&s;h re|cu&s;ants. We&s;ton, a profe&s;&s;ed papi&s;t, was created lord high trea&s;urer, and after|wards earl of Portland; Laud was tran&s;lated to the bi&s;hopric of London, and Montague, author of the Appeal to Cae&s;ar, was promoted to the &s;ee of Chi|che&s;ter. A con&s;iderable armament had been equpped for the relief of Rochelle, which was now clo&s;ely be&s;ieged. The earl of Denbigh had &s;ailed thither; but neglected to attack the French fleet, and returned with di&s;honour. In order to wipe out this &s;tain, the duke of Buckingham re&s;olved to take the command upon him&s;elf, and repaired to Port&s;mouth, where the fleet and forces were al|ready prepared for the expedition. On the fe&s;tival of St. Bartholomew, in the morning, the duke had been in earne&s;t conver&s;ation with Mon&s;ieur de Soubize, and &s;ome other French gentlemen, who u&s;ed &s;uch ge&s;ticulations in &s;peaking,
<PB N="217" REF="2190" MS="Y">
according to the cu&s;tom of their country, that the by-&s;tanders, who did not un|der&s;tand the French language, imagined they &s;poke with great animo&s;ity. Im|mediately after this di&s;cour&s;e, Buckingham, in going to another apartment, turned about in the pa&s;&s;age to &s;peak with Sir Thomas Fryar. In this po&s;ture he was &s;tabbed by an un&s;een hand, that left a knife &s;ticking in his brea&s;t. He exclaimed "The villain hath killed me!" and drawing the in&s;trument from the wound, dropped dead upon the floor. The hou&s;e was immediately filled with tumult and con&s;ternation. The French gentlemen were immediately &s;eized, upon &s;u&s;picion of having perpetrated the murder, becau&s;e they had been heard to expo&s;tulate with &s;uch vivacity. Near the door was found an hat, with|in which appeared a paper, in&s;cribed with four or five lines of the remon&s;trance, declaring the duke of Buckingham an enemy to the kingdom; and underneath were &s;ome &s;hort ejaculations. No body doubted that this hat belonged to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who was &s;een walking before the gate with great compo&s;ure; and at once confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf the author of the deed. Some of the duke's officers drew their &s;words, in order to &s;acrifice him on the &s;pot, and he &s;tood with open arms to receive his fate: but, they were prevented from executing their purpo&s;e by the interpo&s;ition of others, who prudently &s;ugge&s;ted that he might make very material di&s;coveries. His name was Felton, a gentleman by birth, who had &s;erved as lieutenant in the expedition to the I&s;le of Rh&eacute;; and his captain being &s;lain, &s;ollicited the command of the company, which the duke be&s;towed upon another per&s;on. Felton con&s;idered his di&s;appointment as an affront and injury which could not be redre&s;&s;ed. It made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his mind, which was of a gloomy ca&s;t. He quitted the &s;ervice, became a fanatic in religion; and when the commons publi&s;hed their remon&s;trance, he looked upon it as act of duty to de&s;troy the per&s;on whom they declared the author of every national calamity. This reflection co-operating with his revenge, produced the mo&s;t de&s;perate en|thu&s;ia&s;m, under the influence of which he repaired to Port&s;mouth, where he ea&s;ily found an opportunity of executing his purpo&s;e among the croud of peo|ple who had daily acce&s;s to the duke's apartments. He declared that no per&s;on was privy to his de&s;ign, which was formed purely on con&s;cientious motives; and he &s;eemed to think he had done his country &s;ignal &s;ervice; but, afterwards, at his trial he expre&s;&s;ed great contrition and abhorrence of his guilt. The king was then at Southwick, in the neighbourhood of Port&s;mouth; and being at prayers when Sir John Hippe&s;ley entered the room, and in a whi&s;per made him acquainted with the deplorable fate of his favourite, he received the tidings with|out change of countenance; but, the &s;ervice was no &s;ooner ended than he retired to his chamber, and gave vent to the mo&s;t violent tran&s;ports of &s;orrow. Such were the natural effects of a warm and friendly di&s;po&s;ition: but, he had much more cau&s;e to rejoice at the death of a man, who&s;e life mu&s;t have been a perpetual cau&s;e of di&s;tru&s;t and contention between the &s;overeign and the people. He was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon.</NOTE> a nobleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every per&s;onal accompli&s;hment, whether natural or ac|quired. His apprehen&s;ion was quick, and his under&s;tanding tolerably cultivated; he was brave, courteous, and liberal; but, fiery, ra&s;h, impetuous, overbearing, and &s;o much a &s;lave to his pa&s;&s;ions, that he &s;crupled not to &s;acrifice the intere&s;t of the nation to his own private views of re&s;entment. After Buckingham's death, the earl of Lind&s;ey was appointed admiral and commander of the fleet and army de&s;tined for the relief of Rochelle; but before he reached the coa&s;t of France,
<PB N="218" REF="2200">
the cardinal de Richelieu had built a &s;urpri&s;ing mole acro&s;s the mouth of the harbour, which effectually excluded the Engli&s;h &s;uccours; &s;o that the inhabi|tants were obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, even in &s;ight of their allies.</P>

<P>The parliament re-a&s;&s;embling in January, a committee of com|mons was appointed to examine the ca&s;e of &s;everal merchants who&s;e effects had been &s;eized by the officers of the cu&s;toms, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to pay the duty of tonnage and poundage. The king convening both hou&s;es at Whitehall, declared that he had never entertained a thought of enjoying that &s;ub&s;idy otherwi&s;e than as a voluntary gift of his people; and de&s;ired that all mutual jealou&s;y might be laid a&s;ide. In a few days he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the commons, reque&s;ting they would pa&s;s the bill of tonnage and poundage; but they pretended the affairs of religion were much more pre&s;&s;ing. They complained that the laws were not executed again&s;t popi&s;h recu&s;ants; that, on the contrary, papi&s;ts were favoured with lucrative employments; that &s;ome|thing was daily added to the ceremonies of religion; that Cozens, dean of Durham, had introduced into his church, angels, &s;aints, altars, and lighted tapers on Candlemas-day; and that Arminiani&s;m was greatly encouraged. Notwith&s;tanding repeated me&s;&s;ages from the king, urging them to proceed with the bill of tonnage and poundage, they &s;et on foot an inquiry into the cau&s;e of the&s;e religious grievances. They, in a formal prote&s;tation, expre&s;&s;ed their belief in the thirty-nine articles, as explained by the doctors of the Eng|li&s;h church; and their abhorrence of the opinions and doctrines adopted by Je&s;uits and Arminians. They &s;ollicited the king to proclaim a fa&s;t; and pre|&s;ented an addre&s;s, containing a &s;ort of apology for their preferring the affairs of religion to any other article of bu&s;ine&s;s, in their deliberations. Buckingham, the great object of their aver&s;ion, being now removed, their re&s;entment glowed with double rancour again&s;t Laud bi&s;hop of London, who, as the king's &s;pi|ritual director, encouraged all his high notions of the hierarchy and preroga|tive. He was branded as a &s;uper&s;titious eccle&s;ia&s;tic, chief of the Arminian &s;ect, by who&s;e influence Montague, Co&s;ens, Sibthorpe, and Manwaring, had been pardoned and even promoted to bi&s;hoprics or rich benefices; and they exclaimed again&s;t him as an implacable foe not only to the puritans, but al&s;o to the liberty of his country.</P>

<P>While the commons were employed in examining the&s;e religious grievances, the warehou&s;e of one Rolls, a merchant, and member of the hou&s;e, was &s;ealed up by the officers of the cu&s;toms, becau&s;e he had refu&s;ed to pay the tonnage and poundage. A proce&s;s was already in&s;tituted in the court of ex|chequer again&s;t tho&s;e recu&s;ants; and now the commons &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the barons of that court, importing, That they had re&s;olved the bill of tonnage and poundage &s;hould not be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed until the goods &s;hould be re&s;tored to the pro|prietors. The officer of the cu&s;toms, being que&s;tioned at the bar of the hou&s;e, de|clared his maje&s;ty had commanded him to make no other reply, but that the goods were &s;eized for duties due to his late maje&s;ty. In a committee of the whole hou&s;e the que&s;tion was propo&s;ed, Whether they &s;hould proceed again&s;t the of|ficer of the cu&s;toms? Violent debates en&s;ued; and Sir John Fineh, the &s;peaker, being de&s;ired to put the que&s;tion to the vote, &s;aid he could not comply without di&s;obeying the king's order. They were immediately adjourned to the twenty|fifth day of February, and afterwards to the &s;econd of March, by the king's
<PB N="219" REF="2210">
order. When they met again, the &s;ame affair was brought upon the carpet: the &s;peaker again refu&s;ed to collect the votes: he declared, in the king's name, that the hou&s;e was adjourned to the tenth day of March, and attempted to withdraw; but was forcibly held in the chair by Holles and Valentine, until the majority had, in a tumultuous manner, pa&s;&s;ed a prote&s;tation, by which all the favour|ers of popery and Arminiani&s;m, all tho&s;e who advi&s;ed or a&s;&s;i&s;ted the king in levying tonnage and poundage before it was granted by parliament, and all per&s;ons &s;ubmitting to the payment of it, were declared enemies to the &s;tate, and traitors to the liberties of England. As the king had nothing to expect from &s;uch a &s;e&s;&s;ion, he was not &s;orry for this pretence to di&s;&s;olve the parliament, and publi&s;hed a proclamation, &s;ignifying his intention on this &s;ubject. Next day nine members of the lower hou&s;e were &s;ummoned to appear before the council; four of the&s;e obeyed the citation, and were committed to the Tower, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to give an account of what had pa&s;&s;ed in their hou&s;e when the &s;peaker was detained in the chair. The papers of Holles, Elliot, and Sel|den, were &s;eized; and a proclamation i&s;&s;ued for arre&s;ting the five that did not appear. On the tenth day of March the king came to the hou&s;e, and di&s;|&s;olved the parliament, after a &s;hort &s;peech, in which he thanked the lords for their dutiful and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive behaviour, and declared his re&s;entment again&s;t &s;ome vipers in the lower hou&s;e, who had blinded the eyes of their fellows with the mi&s;t of in&s;olence and &s;edition.</P>

<P>That he might not &s;eem to exert a de&s;potic power in puni&s;hing tho&s;e leaders of the people, he propo&s;ed certain que&s;tions to the judges; and, according to their an&s;wers, ordered the attorney-general to rai&s;e a proce&s;s again&s;t the impri&s;oned members for their violent, unlawful, and &s;editious be|haviour in the hou&s;e of commons. Alderman Chambers was profecuted in the Star-chamber for having &s;aid that the merchants were more oppre&s;&s;ed in Eng|land than in Turkey; and condemned to an exorbitant fine, the payment of which reduced him to extreme poverty. Long was &s;entenced to pay two thou|&s;and pounds for having violated his oath, in &s;itting as a member of the lower hou&s;e, after he had been &s;worn &s;heriff of Wilt&s;hire. The impri&s;oned members in vain demanded the privilege of the Habeas Corpus: they were detained in confinement from March to October; and then the court of King's-bench de|creed that they &s;hould remain in pri&s;on during the king's plea&s;ure. Elliot was moreover ca&s;t in a fine of two thou&s;and pounds, Valentine in one of five hundred, and Holles obliged to pay a thou&s;and marks. Such arbitrary aud unpopular mea&s;ures could not fail to inflame the public di&s;content. The po|pulace murmured openly, and di&s;per&s;ed libels again&s;t bi&s;hop Laud, and lord We&s;ton the trea&s;urer, as the authors of all tho&s;e violent coun&s;els. The king publi&s;hed a long declaration in his own defence, ju&s;tifying the &s;teps he had taken, and in particular the di&s;&s;olution of the parliament, from the in&s;olent and &s;editious conduct of the members: but this apology had little weight with the nation; the impri&s;oned members were looked upon as martyrs to the liberties of the people. The di&s;pute was con&s;idered as a conte&s;t between the crown and the &s;ubject; no wonder therefore that the king's parti&s;ans were not the mo&s;t numerous. Individuals were heard publicly to complain that the king intended to de&s;troy the privileges of parliament; that commerce was ruined, religion in danger, and the kingdom on the brink of &s;lavery, from which nothing could
<PB N="220" REF="2220">
&s;ave it but a new parliament. Charles, informed of the&s;e clamours, ende$|voured to &s;ilence them by a proclamation, forbidding all per&s;ons to di&s;cour&s;e upon the &s;ubject of a new parliament; and a &s;atyrical performance appearing, under the title of Advice to the king to bridle the in&s;olence of parliaments, the S$ar-chamber declared it a &s;editious libel.</P>

<P>Charles, finding it impracticable to maintain the war without &s;ub|&s;idies, re&s;olved to conclude a peace with France, which was accordingly ef|fected by the mediation of Venice, on condition that the articles of the queen's marriage &s;hould be confirmed; and the Huguenots were left to the mercy of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ruthworth C$$r$don</NOTE> their &s;overeign. Since the beginning of this war France and Spain had acted altogether on the defen&s;ive$ they knew the di&s;putes between Charles and his parliament would di&s;able him from executing any important &s;cheme to their pre$udice; and they would not concert any plan of operation again&s;t him, that might unite the kingdom from a &s;en&s;e of common danger: they even di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Engli&s;h pri&s;oners, who had been taken in the inglorious expeditions to Cadiz and the i&s;le of Rh&eacute;. The peace with France was &s;ucceeded by a treaty with Spain, which was next year ratified without any difficulty. The five &s;ub&s;idies, granted by parliament, produced &s;o little, that the king ordered the tonnage and poundage to be levied with great rigour. The cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers were impowered to enter hou&s;es, and break open warehou&s;es, che&s;ts, and clo&s;ets, to &s;earch for goods which had not payed the duty; and, on this pre$ence of &s;earching, they committed numberle&s;s acts of fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion. In order to prevent the popular clamours from producing in&s;urrections, the council i&s;&s;ued orders for arming and reviewing the militia, that the people might be intimidated by their appearance; while, on the other hand, they were amu&s;ed with public orders for putting the laws in execution again&s;t papi&s;ts. At the &s;ame time the king endeavoured to fill his coffers by granting exclu&s;ive privileges for the &s;ale of commodities and provi&s;ions: &s;o that the whole king|dom was filled with monopolies, to the un&s;peakable prejudice of trade and<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ Ch. 16$0.</NOTE> manufacture. Pre&s;byteriani&s;m having made great progre&s;s in England, the king, by the advice of bi&s;hop Laud, &s;ent in&s;tructions to the prelates of the kingdom, enjoining them, among other things, to take e&s;pecial care that $o puritan mini&s;ter &s;hould be admitted into the church; and to di&s;cover all &s;uch as &s;hould neglect the rites pre&s;cribed in the canons. The pre&s;byterians conceived the mo&s;t implacable hatred again&s;t Laud for this and other in&s;tances of his enmity, and he &s;everely felt their re&s;entment in the &s;equel <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">On the twenty-ninth day of May the queen was delivered of a prince, who was baptized by the name of Charles.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The power of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria was now become &s;o formidable in Germany, that all the neighbouring potentates were alarmed; and no prince &s;eemed &s;o well qualified to bridle its ambition as Gu&s;tavus Adolphus king of Sweden; upon him therefore France and England turned their eyes. He was animated with a de&s;ire to &s;upport the liberties of the empire; but employed in a war with Poland, which for the pre&s;ent hindered him from gratifying that inclination. The di&s;pute was compromi&s;ed by the mediation of the two crowns. The French court con&s;idered him as a proper in&s;trument to check the growth of a rival power; and Charles of England hoped by his means to
<PB N="221" REF="2230">
effect the re&s;toration of the palatine. He engaged with Gu&s;tavus in a pri|vate convention for this purpo&s;e, and &s;upplied him with a reinforcement of &s;ix thou&s;and men, commanded by the marquis of Hamilton, in who&s;e name they were levied, that the king might &s;ave appearances with the hou&s;e of Au$tria. The Swede, however, did not perform his engagements: for after he had obtained &s;everal glorious victories, he refu&s;ed to re&s;tore the king of Bohem$a, except upon &s;uch har&s;h conditions as that prince could not ac|cept with any regard to his honour. Charles, perceiving that he had been duped, withdrew his forces, which had done good &s;ervice, and recalled Vane, who had accompanied the king of Sweden, in quality of Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador.</P>

<P>Among the methods practi&s;ed by Charles to rai&s;e money, was that of appointing commi&s;&s;ioners to compound with tho&s;e, who though &s;um|moned at his coronation to come and receive the honour of knighthood, had neglected to appear. In the reign of Edward II. an old cu&s;tom was enacted<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> into a law, importing, That every man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of twenty pounds a year in land$ &s;hould be knighted: almo&s;t all the &s;ucceeding monarchs had put the law in execution. Charles, con&s;idering the difference of value in money be|tween that reign and the pre&s;ent time, &s;ummoned tho&s;e only who&s;e yearly rent amounted to forty pounds: yet even this mitigation was deemed a hard&s;hip, becau&s;e the value of twenty pounds, in the days of Edward, was equal to four times the &s;um in the reign of Charles. A great number had therefore refu&s;ed to obey the mandate, and the&s;e were now fined for their di&s;obedience. A con|&s;iderable &s;um was likewi&s;e exacted by way of compo&s;ition from tho&s;e who de|clined the order. This was likewi&s;e a &s;ubject of di&s;content, though not &s;o<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1631.</NOTE> inflammatory as the conduct of Laud with re&s;pect to religion. That prelate, though irreproachable in his morals, was, either from &s;uper&s;tition or hatred to the puritans, inflexibly attached to certain idle ceremonies, which gave infinite offence to all the fanatics in England. The&s;e appeared as flagrant innovations, at the con&s;ecration of St. Catherine's church. When he approached the we&s;t door, a loud voice was heard, exclaiming, <Q>&startq;Open, open ye everla&s;ting doors, that the king of glory may enter in!&endq;</Q> The gates were in&s;tantly thrown open: then the bi&s;hop entering, fell on his knees; and with his eyes and hands up|rai&s;ed, exclaimed, <Q>&startq;This place is holy, the ground is holy; in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, I pronounce it holy.&endq;</Q> In his way to the chancel he &s;everal times took up an handful of du&s;t, and threw it in the air$ he bowed frequently at the communion-table; he, with his attendants, walked in proce&s;&s;ion around the church, &s;inging p&s;alms: he repeated a form of prayer, and pronounced the&s;e words with a loud voice, <Q>&startq;We con&s;ecrate this church; and &s;eparate it unto thee as holy ground, not to be profaned by common u&s;es.&endq;</Q> Standing by the communion-table, he &s;olemnly anathematized all who &s;hould pollute that &s;acred place; and poured forth benedictions upon tho&s;e who had contributed to build and adorn the edifice. In the clo&s;e of every cur&s;e and ble&s;&s;ing he bowed towards the ea&s;t, and cried, <Q>&startq;Let all the people &s;ay Amen.&endq;</Q> After the &s;ermon he proceeded to admini&s;ter$ the &s;acrament: in advancing to the communion-table he made &s;everal genuflexions, and bowed &s;even times very low to the bread and wine. Having lifted up the corner of a cloth that covered the Euchari&s;t, he dropped it &s;uddenly; and, retreating three paces, bowed three times almo&s;t to pro&s;tration. Then he advanced again,

In the mean time, the king created him pre|&s;ident of the council of the North, a court of judicature e&s;tabli&s;hed at York in the reign of Henry VIII. for the relief of poor $uitors in the counties of York, Northumberland, Cumberland, W$&s;tmin&s;ter, and the bi&s;hopric of Durham, who could not a$$ord to bring their $au&s;es into the courts of We&s;tmin&s;ter. This court, being intirely conducted by the king's private in|&s;tructions, without any other dependance, degenerated into a terrible grie|vance, in&s;omuch that, in a &s;ub&s;equent parliament, Mr. Hyde, afterwards earl of Clarendon, declared to the hou&s;e of lords, that of fifty-eight articles of in|&s;tructions, there was not one that did not either contradict or tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of the realm. The king, having now governed the nation three or four years without a parliament, began to find him&s;elf more at ea&s;e than he had ever been &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the thron$. His revenue now flowed in certain channels. The commons became habituated to tho&s;e impo&s;itions, again&s;t which they had exclaimed as the acts of arbitrary power; and though indi|viduals were occa&s;ionally handled with rigour, the people in general found them&s;elves rich and ea&s;y under his admini&s;tration.

<P>In this &s;ea&s;on of tranquillity he re&s;olved to vi&s;it his antient king|dom of Scotland, where he was accordingly crowned with grea$ magnificence; and the parliament, being a&s;&s;embled at Edinburgh, granted a larger &s;ub&s;idy than ever had been given to any other king of that realm. The Engli&s;h mo|ney had by this time $ound it$ way into Scotland, and the nobles of that country even vied with the Engli&s;h courtiers in the &s;plendour of their equipage and $ntertainments. Charles inherited his father's de&s;ign of bringing religion in Scotland to a conformity with the Engli&s;h church: and bi&s;hop Laud ac|companied him in this journey, to facilitate the execution of the &s;cheme. As a preparatory &s;tep he pa&s;&s;ed two acts in the Scotti&s;h parliament, the fir&s;t in$i|$uled, An act concerning the king's prerogative, and the habit of the clergy$
<PB N="224" REF="2260">
This was no other than the confirmation of a &s;tatute enacted in the preceding reign, impowering the king to give &s;uch directions as he &s;hould think proper, with regard to the dre&s;s of the clergy.

Both the&s;e acts met with oppo&s;ition from the pre&s;byterians: they looked upon the fir&s;t as a prelude to the u&s;e of the &s;urplice, which was an abomination in their eyes; and the words "at pre&s;ent pro$e&s;&s;ed," they con&s;idered as an aequi|vocal<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$$$worth.</NOTE> expre&s;&s;ion, calculated to re&s;tore epi&s;copal government.

<P>The Scotti&s;h religioni&s;ts were not mi&s;taken in their conjec|tures. The king's purpo&s;e was really to introduce the rites of the Engli&s;h church, and re-e&s;tabli&s;h epi&s;copacy in its former power and &s;plendour. Bi&s;hop Laud preached in the royal chapel at Edinburgh on the benefit of conformity, and the reverend ceremonies of the church. He propo&s;ed to the Scotti&s;h bi&s;hops that the Engli&s;h liturgy &s;hould be received into their &s;ervice. They objected to this propo&s;al, that &s;uch a &s;tep would alarm the jealou&s;y of the nation, which would be apt to look upon the Engli&s;h liturgy as the fore|runner of Engli&s;h laws, and an encroachment upon the independency of the kingdom. They therefore de&s;ired that another might be compo&s;ed for the u&s;e of the Scotti&s;h church, that &s;hould be the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance, but different in &s;ome immaterial particulars. The king embraced this advice, though contrary to the inclination of Laud. He was him&s;elf jealous of the independency of his native kingdom; and appointed a &s;elect number of the Scotti&s;h bi&s;hops to form a new liturgy for their own &s;ervice. He erected Edinburgh into a bi&s;hopric; created the archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's chancellor of the kingdom; he admitted &s;everal other prelates to $eats in the privy council, and in the college of ju&s;tice$ a very un&s;ea&s;onable mark of his re|gard for the hierarchy; for the bi&s;hops, by this promotion, incurred the hatred and envy of the noblemen, who, though they re&s;pected them in their eccle&s;ia&s;tical capacities, could not bear to &s;ee them in civil $tations, to<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$arendon.</NOTE> which they them&s;elves thought they had a better title.</P>

Being pro&s;ecuted in the Star-chamber, his book was condemned to be burned by the hands of the common hangman: the author was expelled from the bar, degraded from the degree he had received at Oxford, deprived of his ears in the pillory, &s;entenced to pay a fine of five thou&s;and pounds to the king, and to undergo perpetual impri&s;onment. The printer was ca&s;t in a fine of five hundred pounds; and Abbot's chaplain, who had licen&s;ed it, was obliged to pay fifty.

Archbi&s;hop Laud was the profe&s;&s;ed enemy not only of the Briti&s;h pre&s;byterians, but likewi&s;e of the Dutch, Walloon, and French refugees, who had been formed into different congregations in Eng|land, &s;ince the reign of Edward VI. with liberty to celebrate divine &s;ervice in their own forms.

Sir Anthony Roger was for this fault condemned by the Star-chamber in &s;uch an exce&s;&s;ive fine, as terrified all the other delinquents into immediate compo&s;ition. Charles finding many per&s;ons &s;till refractory with regard to the payment of &s;hip-money, publi&s;hed the deci&s;ion of the judges, who declared, that in ca&s;e of national danger, the king was impowered to levy a tax for the defence of the kingdom; and that he alone was the judge of that danger, as well as of the time and manner in which it ought to be averted. Notwith|&s;tanding this opinion, John Hambden, being taxed in twenty &s;hillings for an e&s;tate which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Buckingham&s;hire, re&s;olved to &s;tand &s;uit, rather than comply with an impo&s;ition &s;o contrary to the laws of the realm, and the liberties of the &s;ubject.

<P>The king was not &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by the&s;e mea&s;ures as to ne|glect<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1637.</NOTE> the de&s;ign he had formed of altering the &s;tate of religion in Scotland. The bi&s;hops of that country employed to compo&s;e a liturgy, had begun with a book of canons; and this having been approved by Laud, the king &s;ent it back to Scotland, as the &s;tandard of church-di&s;cipline. The pretence u&s;ed for introduc|ing this book, was that the acts of the general a&s;&s;embly were not in print; and could not therefore be known to the people. Nothing could be more ab&s;urd than the conduct of Charles in this whole affair. The canons, through a gro&s;s over&s;ight of tho&s;e who compiled them, injoined conformity with the new litur|gy, which was not yet compo&s;ed; they were recommended as an abridgment of eccle&s;ia&s;tical acts; and &s;uppo&s;ed the hierarchy and juri&s;diction of bi&s;hops in full force, though, for fifty years after the reformation, the general a&s;&s;emblies had always condemned and rejected epi&s;copacy; and in all their acts avowed a pre&s;byterian government. The liturgy being prepared, the king &s;ent orders for reading it on Ea&s;ter-day in all the churches at Edinburgh; but, the earl of Traquair, trea&s;urer for Scotland, repre&s;enting that dangerous con&s;equences might en&s;ue, &s;hould the populace be &s;urpri&s;ed with it before they were prepared for its reception; the ceremony was po&s;tponed till the twenty-third day of July, when the chancellor, attended by the council, &s;ome bi&s;hops, the lords of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, and the magi&s;trates of the city, repaired to the cathedral to &s;ee the king's order put in execution. The dean had no &s;ooner opened the book, and begun to read, than the populace that were in the church interrupted him with loud clamour and execrations, &s;o as that he could not be heard. The bi&s;hop of Edinburgh mounting the pulpit, in order to appea&s;e them with mild remon&s;trances, was &s;a|&s;uted with the &s;ame cries and cur&s;es, and a &s;hower of &s;tones and &s;ticks, by which his life was endangered. The chancellor and the judges were treated with the &s;ame in&s;olence and di&s;re&s;pect. A$ length, the magi&s;trates of the city found means to expel the outrageous people; and the doors being locked, the &s;ervice was performed, though not without continual interruption from the enraged multitude in the &s;treet. They &s;till continued to revile the &s;ervice, and threaten the prelates; they broke the church-windows with &s;tones and other mi&s;&s;$les; and when the bi&s;hop of Edinburgh came forth, it was with great difficulty that he e&s;caped a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. The other churches of the city were filled with the like tumults, in which, however, no per&s;on of any rank &s;eemed to have the lea&s;t concern. A great concour&s;e of people re&s;orting to Edinburgh in the month of October, the council began to fear another riot, and publi&s;hed proclamations, &s;ignifying, That the council would be transferred to Dundee; commanding all &s;trangers to quit the city; and prohibiting a book written again&s;t the Engli&s;h and popi&s;h ceremonies impo&s;ed upon the church of Scotland. Next day, the populace be&s;ieged the place where the council was a&s;&s;embled, demanding, with dreadful imprecations, that the bi&s;hop of Galloway might be delivered into their hands. At the &s;ame time, they blocked up the magistrates in the town-hou&s;e, and in a petition de&s;ired that the liturgy might be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and that certain popular mini&s;ters, who had been &s;ilenced for their turbulence and &s;editious beha|viour,
<PB N="228" REF="2300">
&s;hould be re&s;tored to their functions. The earl of Traquair was over|tur$ed in the &s;treet, the multitude exclaiming, <Q>&startq;God confound the liturgy and all tho&s;e who maintain it.&endq;</Q> At length they di&s;per&s;ed, at the intreaties of &s;ome burghers, to whom they payed a particular regard; and were forbid by another proclamation to rea&s;&s;emble in the &s;treets. Far from being intimidated by &s;uch mandates, they loudly demanded that their mini&s;ters &s;hould be re&s;tored. A petition was pre&s;ented to the chancellor, in the name of all the inhabitants of Edinburgh, men, women, children, and &s;ervants; and another by the noblemen, gentlemen, and burghers, again&s;t the liturgy and the canons. The pulpits re|&s;ounded with exclamations again&s;t them, as the preludes to popery and arbitrary power. The bi&s;hops were reviled as the mini&s;ters of &s;atan, antichri&s;t, and cor|ruption; and the populace compared to Balaam's a$s, who&s;e mouth the Lord had opened. The king, informed of the&s;e di&s;turbances, in&s;tead of taking pro|per mea&s;ures to allay the ferment of the nation, ordered his mini&s;ters in Scot|land to publi&s;h an ambiguous proclamation, declaring his abhorrence of popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tit$on, and his intention to introduce nothing but what &s;hould tend to the advancement of the religion at pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ed in his kingdom of Scotland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>Nothing could be better calculated for inflaming and exa&s;perat|ing that &s;pirit of di&s;content and animo&s;ity, which had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the people. The commonalty were aver&s;e to epi&s;copal government from religious principles: but, the noblemen and landholders were influenced by more carnal motives. They knew the king's attachment to the clergy; they had &s;een his late effort to re&s;tore them to their antient power and dignity; they dreaded a re&s;umption of the crown-lands; they could not bear to &s;ee prelates introduced into the highe&s;t offices of the &s;tate; and the$ were in&s;pired with a national jea|lou&s;y of all innovations from England. To the&s;e, &s;ome among them added con|&s;cientious con&s;iderations; but, religion was the univer&s;al pretext. The pre&s;by|terian mini&s;ters were u&s;ed as tools on this occa&s;ion, to foment the popular fana|tici&s;m, by alarming their minds with the fears of popery, calumniating the bi&s;hops, and expatiating upon the chains of religious &s;lavery that were forging for the nation. Immediately after the la&s;t proclamation was publi&s;hed at Stirling, the earl of Hume and lord Lind&s;ay, accompanied by many other noblemen, and a great concour&s;e of people, repaired to the market-cro&s;s, and, without regarding the pre&s;ence and authority of the council, read publicly a prote&s;t, importing, That they would pre&s;ent their grievances to the king: That they could not &s;ub|mit to the bi&s;hops as judges, until they &s;$ould have acquitted them&s;elves of the crimes laid to their charge: That no proclamation or act of council, re&s;olved upon in pre&s;ence of tho&s;e prelates, &s;hould prejudice the prote&s;ters: That none of their a&s;&s;ociates &s;hould be expo&s;ed to any danger in their lives and fortunes$

nor incur any penalty civil or $ccle&s;i$&s;$ical, for having refu&s;ed to acquie&s;ce in the &s;aid acts, books, canons, ri$es, juri&s;dictions, and proclamations, compo&s;ed and publi&s;hed contrary to the decrees of the general a&s;&s;embly, or again&s;t the laws of the realm: That, in ca&s;e this di&s;pute &s;hould produce any di&s;order, it &s;hould not be imputed to them, ina&s;much as the council refu&s;ed to receive a re|mon&s;trance and declinatory, which they had lately pre&s;ented; and, that their petitions tended to nothing but the maintenance of the true religion in Scot|land, and to the honour of his maje&s;ty. The &s;ame proclamation was read at Linlithgow and Edinburgh.</P>

<P>Their next &s;tep was to e&s;tabli&s;h a council for the direction of their affairs. They erected four offices or tables, con&s;i&s;ting of the noblemen, the gentlemen, the boroughs, and the mini&s;ters. From the&s;e they elected de|puties, to form a general table or council to take re&s;olutions according to the in&s;tructions received from their con&s;tituents. The whole authority of the king|dom was now lodged in the&s;e tables; and all their re&s;olutions were executed with the utmo&s;t regularity. Their fir&s;t important tran&s;action was their form|ing the &s;ol$mn league and covenant, which was no other than an a&s;&s;ociation of the people, expre&s;&s;ing their dete&s;tation and abhorrence of all innovations in re|ligion; binding them&s;elves by a &s;olemn oath to defend the presbyterian doc|trines, with their lives and fortunes; and, declaring they would employ their whole power to defend his maje&s;ty's per&s;on and authority, in maintaining the religion, liberties, and laws of the kingdom again&s;t all per&s;ons what&s;oever. This obligation recapitulated the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, which had been &s;igned by the late king at two different periods of his reign; and was the more dangerous, as it implied a &s;ort of independence of the regal authority, by re&s;tricting the loy|alty of the a&s;&s;ociates to certain conditional limits. It was no &s;ooner publi&s;hed than the people ran in crowds to &s;ub&s;cribe it; and it was &s;igned by almo&s;t all the per&s;ons of con&s;equence in the kingdom, except the privy coun&s;ellors, the judges, the bi&s;hops, and tho&s;e who enjoyed places under the crown: &s;o that it may be very fairly deemed a national effort in defence of religious liberty. It mu&s;t be owned at the &s;ame time, that &s;uch an a&s;&s;ociation was illegal and &s;editious, and the very intent of it contrary to the king's eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;upremacy, which had been recognized in the a&s;&s;embly of Gla&s;gow, as well as to &s;ucce&s;&s;ive acts of parliament, by which, during the la&s;t forty years, epi&s;copacy had been re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed and confirmed in Scotland. The covenanters pleaded, That the recogni|tion had been obtained by compul&s;ion: and, That tho&s;e acts of parliament were impo&s;ed by arbitrary power, without the con&s;ent of the clergy, and in diametrical oppo&s;ition to the &s;en&s;e of the nation.</P>

<P>The king, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;orders, &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his de|&s;ign to introduce the liturgy and the canons, and &s;ent the marquis of Hamilton to repre&s;ent his per&s;on in Scotland, under the title of high commi&s;&s;ioner, hop|ing that nobleman had intere&s;t and indu&s;try enough to reduce the malcontents to obedience, without giving them any material &s;atisfaction in their pretended grievances. The tables fore&s;eeing a &s;torm, began to prepare for their own de|fence. They endeavoured to &s;eize a &s;hip-load of arms &s;ent by the king to be depo&s;ited in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh; but, being di&s;appointed, they &s;et a guard upon that fortre&s;s, to prevent their being introduced: at the &s;ame time, they im|ported a provi&s;ion of the like nature for their own u&s;e. The commi&s;&s;ioner ar|riving
<PB N="230" REF="2320">
in Scotland, demanded, that they &s;hould renounce the covenant, return to their obedience, and let the king know what they de&s;ired for their &s;ati&s;|faction. They in&s;i&s;ted upon a general a&s;&s;embly and a free parliament; declar|ed they had never deviated from their obedience; and that they would rather renounce their bapti&s;m than the covenant. The marquis publi&s;hed a proclama|tion, in which the king a&s;&s;ured his &s;ubjects of Scotland, That he had no de&s;ign to introduce innovations: That no &s;tep &s;hould be taken contrary to the laws: and, That he would convoke a general a&s;&s;embly and parliament as &s;oon as his con|venience would permit. The covenanters an&s;wered, in a public prote$tation, That a &s;imple proclamation was no &s;ecurity for the redre&s;s of their grievances: That the bi&s;hops were &s;till left at liberty to practi&s;e tho&s;e innovations of which they complained: and, That the laws to which the king promi&s;ed to conform, were &s;uch as con&s;tituted their oppre&s;&s;ion. The commi&s;&s;ioner having informed him&s;elf of the &s;tate of affairs in Scotland, thought it incumbent upon him to communicate his ob&s;ervations to the king in per&s;on. He therefore repaired to London, and, in a little time returned to Edinburgh, ve&s;ted with power to con|voke a parliament and general a&s;&s;embly. But, before he would agree to the convocation of an a&s;&s;embly, he propo&s;ed eleven articles of re&s;triction, which, upon their remaining ob&s;tinate, were reduced to two conditions, namely, That no layman &s;hould vote in the election of the mini&s;ters deputed to the a&s;&s;embly; and that the a&s;&s;embly &s;hould not determine any thing but by way of remon|&s;trance, according to acts of parliament. The&s;e the covenanters re&s;i&s;ted with di&s;dain, &s;ignifying their de&s;ign of convoking a general a&s;&s;embly, even without the king's permi&s;&s;ion. The marquis re&s;olved to make another journey to court, and in the mean time obtained a promi&s;e from them, that they would not pro|ceed to the election of members till the twentieth day of September. In this interval, however, they took &s;uch precautions as &s;ecured an a&s;&s;embly fit for their purpo&s;es.</P>

<P>When the commi&s;&s;ioner returned, he publi&s;hed a proclamation, im|porting, That the king revoked the liturgy, the book of canons, the high com|mi&s;$$on, and the five articles of Perth: That for the future, the bi&s;hops &s;hould be cen&s;urable by the general a&s;&s;embly: and, That all the &s;ubjects of Scot|land &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, with an oath annexed, very diffe|rent from that of the covenant. Then he convoked a general a&s;&s;embly at Gla&s;gow for the month of November, and a parliament at Edinburgh, to meet in May of the following year. The tables prote&s;ted again&s;t the proclamation, becau&s;e the new oath, in obliging them to maintain the religion at pre&s;ent po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, would operate in favour of the innovations which had been confirmed by acts of parliament. An accu&s;ation, &s;igned by a great number of noblemen, gentlemen, mini&s;ters, and burghers, was pre&s;ented to the presbytery of Edin|burgh again&s;t the bi&s;hops, alledging, That they had not adhered to the condi|tions on which the general a&s;&s;embly at Montro&s;e in the preceding reign, con|&s;ented to their being admitted to parliament. By tho&s;e they were obliged to act only as deputies of the church: to propo&s;e nothing without the expre&s;s order of the church: to con&s;ent to nothing but what &s;hould be for the advantage of the church, on pain of deprivation: and, to be accountable to the general a&s;&s;embly for their conduct in parliament. When the day of meeting arrived, the com|mi&s;&s;ioner plainly perceived that the lay intere&s;t predominated in the a&s;&s;em|bly,
<PB N="231" REF="2330">
in the number of elders and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors that were returned; and all that he could do for the &s;ervice of the king, was to encourage and promote disputes that would furni&s;h him with a pretence to di&s;&s;olve them. The bi&s;hops pre&s;ented a declinatory, pronouncing the a&s;&s;embly n$ll; and the commi&s;&s;ioner entered a great number of prote&s;ts again&s;t their proceedings. At length, finding them deter|mined to &s;it in judgment upon the bi&s;hops, he, on the &s;eventh day of their &s;e&s;|&s;ion, di&s;&s;olved the a&s;&s;embly as illegal, becau&s;e they had introduced lay-elders to vote in their deliberations; becau&s;e the members had been cho&s;en by lay-elders, contrary to cu&s;tom; becau&s;e tho&s;e few members to whom the tables were aver&s;e had been rejected without rea&s;on; and the bi&s;hops were in danger of being tried by tho&s;e who were their profe&s;&s;ed enemies. Notwith&s;tanding this &s;entence of di&s;&s;olution, the a&s;&s;embly of Gla&s;gow continued it&s;elf by virtue of its own au|thority, and pa&s;&s;ed acts by which they not only condemned the liturgy, canons, and high commi&s;&s;ion, excommunicated fourteen bi&s;hops, and abjured epi&s;copal government; but, they likewi&s;e prefumed to rever&s;e divers acts of parliament in favour of epi&s;copacy, and to annul the &s;ub&s;criptions of tho&s;e who had &s;igned the confe&s;&s;ion of faith according to the king's order: nay, they even explained that confe&s;&s;ion as virtually implying an aboli&s;ion of epi&s;copacy. The commi&s;|&s;ioner publi&s;hed another explanation, to prove that epi&s;copacy did &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nel&s;on.

<P>The king was no &s;ooner informed of their pre&s;umption, than he re|&s;olved<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1639.</NOTE> to reduce them by force of arms. He &s;ummoned the nobility to a ren|dezvous at York, on the fir&s;t day of April, ordering each individual to bring thither what number of cavalry he could rai&s;e. He, by means of archbi&s;hop Laud, obtained a large contribution from the clergy; and the catholics, exhorted and animated by the queen, were very liberal on this occa&s;ion. The com|mand of a fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixteen large &s;hips, was conferred upon the mar|quis of Hamilton. The king &s;et out for York on the &s;eventh day of April, and found his army amounted to near twenty thou&s;and men, be&s;ides five thou|&s;and &s;oldiers on board of the fleet, his own guards, and the garri&s;ons of Ber|wick and Carli&s;le. The covenanters, far from being idle, had been before|hand with his maje&s;ty in their preparations. They had received &s;upplies of arms, officers, artillery, and ammunition from Sweden, Germany, and Hol|land; and they e&s;tabli&s;hed a corre&s;pondence with the puritans of England, without who&s;e advice they took no &s;tep of importance. Charles, not without rea&s;on, taxed them with rebellion; and they endeavoured to per&s;uade the Eng|li&s;h nation that they had taken up arms &s;olely in defence of their religious liberties. They repre&s;ented them&s;elves as their brethren in di&s;tre&s;s; and ex|horted them to &s;eize this opportunity of vindicating their country from op|pre&s;&s;ion. In order to convince the world of their pacific intentions, they &s;cru|pulou&s;ly obeyed the king's proclamation, forbidding them to march within ten miles of the Engli&s;h border; and $e believing their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in this particu|lar was the effect of their fear, &s;ent another proclamation to Edinburgh, com|manding them to lay down their arms, on pain of being declared guilty of high trea&s;on, yet offering a pardon to tho&s;e who &s;hould return to oheir duty: but, the magi&s;trates of Edinburgh would not &s;uffer this mandate to be publi&s;hed.</P>

The earl, in all probability, expected they would retreat at his approach; but, he found them advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted on an eminence, to the number of five thou&s;and foot-&s;oldiers, and two hundred hor&s;emen; and their appearance made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon him, that he retired with &s;ome precipitation to the king's quarters in the neighbourhood of Berwick. Charles, far from blaming his conduct, expre&s;&s;ed uncommon &s;atisfaction at his return. He now perceived, that he had been $word$ with regard to the &s;trength of the covenanters, who had by this time reduced the ca&s;tles of Edinburgh and Dumbarton.

<P>The covenanters, appri&s;ed of his inclinations, wrote in a very hum|ble &s;train to the earls of Arundel, E&s;&s;ex, and Holland, imploring their good offices with his maje&s;ty, and prote&s;ting, that nothing was farther from their thoughts than any de&s;ign to invade England. E&s;&s;ex, who both hated and de&s;pi&s;ed the Scots, would not deign to an&s;wer their letter, which he &s;ent to the king; but, the other two noblemen were differently affected. They thought the covenanters had rea&s;on on their &s;ide, and turned their thoughts towards a pacification. When tho&s;e letters had produced their effect, the lord Dumferm|lin arrived from the Scotti&s;h camp with a trumpet; and pre&s;ented to the king an humble &s;upplication, be&s;eeching his maje&s;tyto appoint commi&s;&s;ioners for a treaty. Charles de&s;ired, That the la&s;t proclamation he had &s;ent to Edinburgh &s;hould be read in the Scotti&s;h army. General Le&s;ley complied with his reque&s;t; and then he appointed &s;ix commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the in&s;urgents. The conferences &s;oon produced the following conventions for peace. The Scotti&s;h forces &s;hall be di&s;banded in four and twenty hours after the king's declaration, importing, That all eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs &s;hall be decided by the general a&s;&s;embly; and all civil matters by the parliament: The royal forts, ca&s;tles, and munitions of war, &s;hall be re&s;tored to the king: His maje&s;ty &s;hall then recal his fleet from the coa&s;t of Scotland, and di&s;mi&s;s the per&s;ons, &s;hips, and effects which it had &s;eized: No a&s;&s;embly &s;hall be held, but &s;uch as is approved by acts of parlia|ment. The cau&s;e of this war was never mentioned in the articles of pacifica|tion, which being &s;igned, the Scots di&s;banded their army, and the king ap|pointed the earl of Traquair his high commi&s;&s;ioner at the en&s;uing a&s;&s;embly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$thworth.</NOTE> This nobleman, a faithful adherent to the king, and devoted to the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, was furni&s;hed with a &s;et of in&s;tructions, by which it appears that Charles intended to temporize; and, in all likelihood, there was as little &s;incerity on the &s;ide of the covenanters, who di&s;banded their troops in &s;uch a manner, that they could be rea&s;&s;embled with the utmo&s;t facility and di&s;patch.</P>

<P>The king did not think him&s;elf &s;trong enough to reduce them by force of arms, and began to doubt the fidelity of his Engli&s;h &s;ubjects; and the Scots made this feigned &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, partly out of deference to their corre&s;pon|dents in England, and partly with a view to fix the odium of any &s;ub&s;equent rupture upon the king and his council. At the meeting of the general a&s;&s;embly in Edinburgh, the bi&s;hops, by the advice of his maje&s;ty, pre&s;ented a declinatory to the commi&s;&s;ioner, who &s;ent it to the king, without having communicated the contents to the members. The a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed an act, imputing the troubles of the kingdom to the liturgy, the canons, con&s;ecration, ordination, the high commi&s;&s;ion, the five articles of Perth, the change of the church-government into epi&s;copacy, the introduction of eccle&s;ia&s;tics into civil offices; and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion or interruption of general a&s;&s;emblies: all which innovations they aboli&s;hed; and the commi&s;&s;ioner confirmed their re&s;olutions. By other acts they petitioned the commi&s;&s;ioner and council, to ordain that all the &s;ubjects of Scotland &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe the covenant; and they commanded all the members of the church to &s;ign it, with an expre&s;s clau&s;e, importing, That they received it as explained by the general a&s;&s;embly, that is, containing an abolition of the articles of Perth, the epi&s;copal government; and the elevation of eccle&s;ia&s;tics to civil offices. Then they re&s;olved to petition the king, that their acts might be ratified in par|liament; and without con&s;ulting the commi&s;&s;ioner, appointed another a&s;&s;embly to meet at Aberdeen in the month of July in the following year. The parlia|ment a&s;&s;embling immediately after their &s;eparation, pre&s;ented a number of acts &s;o prejudicial to the king's prerogative, that Charles, by a letter to Traquair, ordered him to prorogue the parliament till the &s;econd day of June in the &s;uc|ceeding year; and &s;hould he meet with any oppo&s;ition, to declare tho&s;e mem|bers who &s;hould continue &s;itting, guilty of high trea&s;on.</P>

<P>This order being notified to the parliament, it immediately &s;epa|rated; but, not before the members had drawn up a declaration, importing, That the earl of Traquair had no power to prorogue the parliament without their own con&s;ent: That the order had been obtained through fal&s;e information: That the earl of Traquair and the council had violated the privileges of par|liament: That though they had a right to &s;it notwith&s;tanding the prorogation, they were willing to &s;eparate, in order to give the king a proof of their obedi|ence. Neverthele&s;s, they left a committee to pre&s;ent an humble petition to his maje&s;ty, which was accordingly tran&s;mitted to London by the earl of Dum|fermlin, and the lord Loudon, appointed their deputies for this purpo&s;e; but the king would not favour them with an audience, becau&s;e they had undertaken their journey without the leave of the high commi&s;&s;ioner. After their return to their own country, Traquair being called to court, reported to the council the tran&s;actions which had pa&s;&s;ed in Scotland &s;ince the pacification; and it was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that the Scots &s;hould be reduced to their duty by force of arms. Neverthele&s;s, the king permitted the committee of Edinburgh to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Scotti&s;h parliament to the king, and not to the council of England, which had no juri&s;diction over them. Then the king favoured them with an audience, attended by the committee; and Loudon, in a long &s;peech, endeavoured to ju&s;tify the tran&s;actions in Scotland: but, the king was not &s;atisfied with his arguments; and the council declared, that the Scotti&s;h deputies had no powers to treat of an accommodation.</P>

<P>Charles complained of the in&s;olence and illegal conduct of their parliament; he taxed the covenanters with having, &s;ince the la&s;t pacification, levied troops; received arms, artillery, and ammunition from foreign countries; impo&s;ed taxes on the &s;ubjects; diffu&s;ed defamatory libels again&s;t his govern|ment, through the kingdom of England; prohibited the king's governor of Edinburgh-ca&s;tle from repairing the walls of that fortre&s;s; and prevented the garri&s;on from &s;upplying them&s;elves with provi&s;ions; fortified other places for their own rebellious purpo&s;es; and &s;ollicited the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of foreign powers again&s;t their own &s;overeign. This la&s;t allegation was &s;upported by an inter|cepted letter, directed to the king of France, in the &s;ame &s;tile that &s;ubjects u&s;e towards their &s;overeign. The &s;ubject of it was to implore a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and re|commend the bearer Colvil as their agent; and it was &s;ub&s;cribed Rothes, Mon|tro&s;e, Montgomery, Loudon, Le&s;ley, Forre&s;ter, Marr. Lord Loudon being examined touching this letter, which was without date, declared it had been written before the la&s;t pacification; but, he was committed pri&s;oner to the Tower; and, the king made an advantage of this occurrence, pretending, that the Scots de&s;igned to introduce an army of foreigners into their country; &s;o that there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to make preparations for the defence of England. Charles certainly acted in the mo&s;t arbitrary and impolitic man|ner, by exerting his &s;upremacy in the church of Scotland, contrary to the ge|nius and con&s;ciences of the people, inflamed to the mo&s;t dangerous pitch of fanatici&s;m; and, without all doubt, the Scots were guilty of rebellion in taking arms again&s;t their &s;overeign, and demanding the abolition of the epi&s;copal go|vernment, which was founded on acts of parliament: but, if ever re&s;i&s;tance is excu&s;able, it mu&s;t certainly be &s;o in &s;uch a ca&s;e, where a people is threatened with temporal and religious &s;lavery.</P>

He ordered every county to rai&s;e a certain number of troops, and exacted the payment of &s;hip-money with great<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> rigour. He was furni&s;hed with a very rea&s;onable pretence for levying this im|po&s;ition. The Dutch fleet under admiral Tromp, attacked a Spani&s;h &s;quadron commanded by Don Antonio de Ocquendo, while he lay at anchor in the Downs, under the protection of Pennington, admiral of England. Forty Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els were de&s;troyed or taken; and Charles deeply re&s;ented this in&s;ult upon the ho|nour of his flag: but, the &s;ituation of his affairs would not allow him to break with the Dutch; and in the beginning of the following year they &s;ent a &s;plen|did emba&s;&s;y with excu&s;es, and a propo&s;al of marriage between the prince of<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$l&s;on.</NOTE> Orange and his elde&s;t daughter. The earl of Northumberland was appointed general of the army de&s;tined to act again&s;t Scotland; and his lieutenant was Wentworth governor of Ireland, lately created earl of Strafford. This noble|man, together with the marquis of Hamilton, and the archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, were con&s;ulted in all important affairs; and advi&s;ed him to convoke a

parliament. Mean while, the king borrowed money of his coun&s;ellors to de|fray the expence of his warlike preparations; and they contributed largely to|wards the relief of his nece&s;&s;ities. Their example was followed by &s;ome other noblemen; &s;o that he found him&s;elf in a condition to proceed with his armament, without waiting for a &s;ub&s;idy.</P>

<P>The parliament meeting on the twenty-third of April, Sir John Finch lately appointed lord-keeper, made a &s;peech in the king's name and pre|&s;ence to both hou&s;es, enlarging upon the in&s;olence of the Scotti&s;h rebels; and demanding an immediate &s;upply that &s;hould enable him to reduce them to obe|dience. Then the king him&s;elf confirmed what he had advanced; and ordered the letter from the Scotti&s;h lords to the French king to be read in their hearing. The commons having cho&s;en their &s;peaker, and appointed their committees, in&s;tead of taking fire at the in&s;olence of the Scots, and granting an immediate &s;upply, appeared, like their predece&s;&s;ors, attached to the &s;ubject of grievances, and received divers petitions, complaining of &s;hip-money, monopolies, the Star|chamber, and the high commi&s;&s;ion. Mr. Pym, in a long di&s;cour&s;e, undertook to demon&s;trate, that the rights of the nation had been violated by encroach|ments on the liberties of parliament, innovations in religion, and inva&s;ions of property. The hou&s;e ordered the regi&s;ters containing the proce&s;s again&s;t Mr. Hambden about the &s;hip-money to be produced. The &s;peaker of the la&s;t par|liament, being examined touching his refu&s;ing to collect the votes, declared, that he was re&s;tricted by his maje&s;ty's expre&s;s order; and they immediately voted, that this order was a violation of privileges. Both hou&s;es being &s;um|moned to Whitehall, the lord-keeper gave them to under&s;tand that the army was on its march; and, that unle&s;s they &s;hould be regularly payed, his maje&s;ty's de&s;igns would prove abortive. He told them, that the king had no intention to reduce the &s;hip-money into an annual revenue; he explained the nece&s;&s;ity of equipping a powerful navy; expatiated upon the readine&s;s with which the Iri&s;h parliament had granted a &s;upply: he de&s;ired they would regulate the tax of ton|nage and poundage; declared his maje&s;ty's firm intention to redre&s;s all their grievances; and exhorted them to lay a&s;ide all jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picion. At the &s;ame time, he &s;et lord Loudon at liberty, through the mediation of the marquis of Hamilton, who is &s;aid to have favoured the covenanters in his heart.</P>

<P>His a&s;&s;urances made no impre&s;&s;ion upon the commons, who conti|nued to deliberate upon the grievances. The king &s;ent a me&s;&s;age, de&s;iring their po&s;itive an&s;wer touching the &s;upply; but they expre&s;&s;ed no inclination to gratify his reque&s;t. Then Sir Henry Vane, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, propo&s;ed in his maje&s;ty's name, That if they would vote twelve &s;ub&s;idies payable in three years, and pa&s;s it into an act immediately, with a clau&s;e, that it &s;hould not determine the &s;e&s;|&s;ion, he would not only ab&s;tain for the pre&s;ent from levying &s;hip-money, but even con&s;ent to its being utterly aboli&s;hed in any manner that they &s;hould judge convenient. This propo&s;al produced violent debates. Notwith&s;tanding the clamours of the oppo&s;ition, the majority &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to give the king &s;ati&s;|faction; but, during that day, the hou&s;e could not take any re&s;olution. Mean while, &s;ome malicious per&s;on in&s;inuated to the king, that next day the commons intended to pa&s;s a vote again&s;t the war with Scotland; and Charles unhappily believing the report, which was intirely groundle&s;s, repaired on the morrow to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth. Clarendon.</NOTE> the hou&s;e of peers, where he di&s;&s;olved the parliament. Immediately after the
<PB N="236" REF="2380">
di&s;&s;olution, which the king ju&s;tified by a long declaration, an order of council was i&s;&s;ued for &s;earching the lord Brook's papers, on &s;u&s;picion of his maintain|ing a corre&s;pondence with the Scotti&s;h rebels: Sir Henry Bella&s;is, and Sir John Hotham, were impri&s;oned for refu&s;ing to an&s;wer que&s;tions that were put to them at the council-board; and Mr. Crew was &s;ent to the Tower, becau&s;e he would not deliver to the council the petitions that were pre&s;ented to the committee for the affairs of religion, of which he had been pre&s;ident. Tho' the parliament was di&s;&s;olved, the convocation continued &s;itting, under the name of a &s;ynod, and enacted certain canons. Among the&s;e there was one, that obliged all eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and &s;uch as had received degrees in the univer&s;ities, to take an oath, importing, that they approved of the doctrine and di&s;cipline of the church of England; and that they never would con&s;ent to any alteration of the church-government by archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, deans, archdeans, &amp;c. After having &s;ettled their canons and this oath, which they had no legal power to impo&s;e, they granted a large &s;ub&s;idy for the maintenance of the Scotti&s;h war, and then &s;eparated.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; L.</HEAD>
<P>The di&s;&s;olution of the parliament rai&s;ed a new ferment among the peo|ple; and their di&s;&s;atisfaction was greatly increa&s;ed by the favour publicly &s;hewn to the Roman catholics, who were protected and even care&s;&s;ed at court, through the influence of the queen, who had per&s;uaded her hu&s;band to receive count Rozetti, the pope's agent, in a public capacity. In order to rai&s;e money for the purpo&s;es of the war, the king ordered every county to advance the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums for cloathing their re&s;pective forces, and conducting them to the general rendezvous. He bought upon credit all the pepper that was on the warehou&s;es of the Ea&s;t-India company, and &s;old it again for ready money: he borrowed forty thou&s;and pounds worth of bullion, which private per&s;ons had &s;ent to the Mint, and punctually repaid it in the &s;equel. He de|manded a loan of three hundred thou&s;and pounds of the city of London; but met with a refu&s;al, at which he was &s;o much incen&s;ed that he re&s;olved to gratify his revenge. The city had formerly received a patent for &s;ettling a colony at Londonderry in Ireland: it was now accu&s;ed before the Star|chamber of having u&s;urped a greater quantity of lands than was granted in the patent, condemned to lo&s;e the grant, and pay a large fine; but it afterwards retrieved the patent: though it was likewi&s;e pro&s;ecuted before the Star-chamber, becau&s;e the mayor and &s;heriffs had neglected to &s;eize the goods and effects of tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to pay the &s;hip-money. Such rigour, exerci&s;ed upon the metropolis, alienated the hearts of the in|habitants from the king, and they in their turn enjoyed their revenge. The Scots continued to foment the animo&s;ity of the people by their artful profe&s;&s;ions and in&s;idious declarations, which were &s;pread all over the king|dom by their travelling-pedlars and other di&s;gui&s;ed agents.</P>

<P>The earl of Northumberland being &s;eized with a dangerous illne&s;s, and the earl of Strafford, his lieutenant detained at London as a nece&s;|&s;ary member of the cabinet council, the lord Conway advanced to New|ca&s;tle with three thou&s;and infantry and fifteen hundred hor&s;e; and there he received inteiligence that the Scotti&s;h army was on its march towards England. Le$$ey, at the head of two and twenty thou&s;and covenanters, pa&s;&s;ed the Tweed at Cold&s;tream, on the twentieth day of Augu&s;t; and in
<PB N="237" REF="2390">
a few days encamped at Newburn, on the banks of the river Tyne, about four miles from Newca&s;tle. He found the lord Conway intrenched on the other &s;ide to guard the ford, and re&s;olved to pa&s;s in the face of the Engli&s;h. He rai&s;hed &s;ome batteries, by which Conway's hor&s;e were put in con|fu&s;ion; and pa&s;&s;ing the river, after a &s;light &s;kirmi&s;h, routed him at the fir&s;t on&s;et. Conway retired with precipitation to Durham; and, thinking him&s;elf un&s;afe in that place, marched back to Northallerton, where he joined the king's army. Mean while the Scots, &s;urpri&s;ed at their own &s;ucce&s;s, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Newca&s;tle, where they found plenty of ammunition and ar|tillery provided for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. The incon&s;iderable action at New|burn was attended with very important con&s;equences. The earl of Strafford, a nobleman of a &s;evere and haughty di&s;po&s;ition, rendered him&s;elf unpopular in the army by reviling Conway's officers and &s;oldiers for their pu&s;illani|mous behaviour at the pa&s;&s;age of the Tyne. The&s;e, on the other hand, in excu&s;e of their own conduct, magnified the number, valour, and di&s;cipline of the enemy: and &s;uch exaggerations made an impre&s;&s;ion upon the whole army, already aver&s;e to the war.</P>

<P>The malecontents now &s;poke loudly again&s;t the government, know|ing this was no time to call them to account for their pre&s;umption: the Scots behaved with great moderation, declaring they entertained no ho&s;tile de&s;igns again&s;t the Engli&s;h, whom they con&s;idered as their friends and brethren in oppre&s;&s;ion; but that their &s;ole aim was to procure acce&s;s to his maje&s;ty, that they might make him acquainted with their grievances. They prote&s;ted their intentions were wholly pacific; they circulated two manife&s;tos, explaining the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, the artifices of their enemies, among whom they ranked as chief the earl of Strafford and the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; the nece&s;&s;ity that compelled them to take arms in their own defence; the rectitude of their intention, which they called God to witne&s;s; and the intere&s;t of England to engage in the &s;ame cau&s;e, for the &s;upport of their liberties and religion. Fi|nally, they &s;ent a petition to the king, be&s;eeching him, in the mo&s;t humble terms, to lend an ear to their complaints, and redre&s;s their grievances by the advice of an Engli&s;h parliament. Charles had convoked an a&s;&s;embly of his nobles at York, that he might u&s;e their advice in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of af|fairs. He de&s;ired to know the particular demands of the Scots, who tran&s;|mitted the following propo&s;itions: That he would cau&s;e the acts of the la&s;t general a&s;&s;embly to be ratified in parliament: That the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, and other places of &s;trength in Scotland, &s;hould be employed for no other purpo&s;e but the defence of the kingdom: That the Scots in England and Ire|land &s;hould not incur any penalty for having &s;ub&s;cribed the covenant, nor be &s;ubjected to oaths or &s;ub&s;criptions contrary to the laws of the realm: That the authors of the&s;e troubles &s;hould be puni&s;hed as incendiaries, according to their demerits: That the &s;hips taken from the Scots &s;hould be re&s;tored, with all their merchandize, and the damage be repaired: That they &s;hould be indemnified for all the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained &s;ince the beginning of the troubles: That the proclamations, declaring them traitors, &s;hould be revoked: And that his maje&s;ty would, with the advice of his Engli&s;h parliament, withdraw the gar|ri&s;ons from the frontiers, that a free communication and commerce between the two nations might be re&s;tored.</P>

<P>The king was now reduced to great perplexity. The city of Lon|don, which befriended the Scots, had pre&s;ented a petition, complaining of illegal impo&s;itions, monopolies, the growth of popery, and propo&s;ing a parliament as the only expedient for redre&s;&s;ing the&s;e national grievances. Another remon&s;trance, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, was &s;igned by the earls of Bedford, E&s;&s;ex, Hartford, Warwi$k, Bri&s;tol, and Mulgrave, the lords Say and Seal, Edward Howard, Bolingbroke, Mandeville, Brook, and Paget; and the gentlemen of York&s;hire delivered an addre&s;s, in which they be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to make peace with Scotland, and a&s;&s;emble a parliament. The king, in a &s;peech to the noblemen of York, declared his re&s;olution to convoke a parliament for the third day of November; and demanded their advice touching the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of his troops, and the an&s;wers he &s;hould return to the propo&s;als of the Scots. The re&s;ult of their deliberations was, that commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be appointed to treat with the enemy. Six$een peers were nominated for that purpo&s;e, to|gether with the earls of Traquair, Morton, and Lanerk, and &s;ome others as their a&s;&s;i&s;tants; at the &s;ame time a re&s;olution was taken to borrow two hun|dred thou&s;and pounds of the city of London, on the credit of the peers, who &s;hould give &s;ecurity for the repayment of that &s;um. The Scots having ap|pointed commi&s;&s;ioners to treat on their &s;ide, the negotiation was begun at Rippon on the fir&s;t day of October. But, in the fir&s;t place, they repre&s;ented that their army was maintained by contributions rai&s;ed upon Cumberland, Newca&s;tle, and the bi&s;hopric of Durham; and in&s;i&s;ted upon the king's making &s;ome provi&s;ion for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence during the treaty. They likewi&s;e refu&s;ed to confer with the earl of Traquair, whom they branded as an incendiary, again&s;t whom they demanded ju&s;tice. After &s;ome di&s;putes the commi&s;&s;ioners agreed upon the preliminary articles, providing for the maintenance of the Scotti&s;h army, at the rate of eight hundred and fifty pounds a day; and re&s;toring the freedom of commerce between the two nations. But the Scots artfully pro|tracted the ratification of the articles until the &s;ixteenth day of October; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$&s;hworth. Clarendon.</NOTE> then they had not &s;ettled the conditions of the truce, much le&s;s di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the articles of the treaty. They fore&s;aw that the noblemen would be obliged to give their attendance in parliament; and in that ca&s;e the conferences would be removed to London, which was propitious to their de&s;igns. They were not mi&s;taken in their conjectures: the negotiation was transferred to London, at the de&s;ire of the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>

<P>THE parliament, at meeting, was unu&s;ually numerous. Every mem|ber looked upon this conjuncture as a national cri&s;is. The king, in his &s;peech, repre&s;$$ted the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;upply to maintain his troops, and o$ means to expel the Scotti&s;h rebels, that the nation in general might be freed from its $ears, and the northern counties di&s;burthened of &s;uch trouble&s;ome g$$&s;ts, whom they were obliged to maintain. The commons having, at the king's recommendation, filled their chair with William Lenthal, a lawyer of &s;ome reputation, e&s;tabli&s;hed a committee of elections. Then they re&s;olved$ that on certain days of every week there &s;hould be a committee of the whole hou&s;e, to deliberate upon the &s;tate of religion, the grievances, the courts of ju&s;tice, commerce, and the affairs of Ireland. Fanatici&s;m, with all its levelling principles, had now over&s;pread the land. Even tho&s;e leaders of the commons, who had a&s;&s;umed a puritanical &s;everity in their words and actions, to work the more effectually on the minds of the populace, were gradually infected with that enthu&s;ia&s;m which at fir&s;t they had only feigned. Many became real reli|gioni&s;ts; while others imbibed a large portion of puritani&s;m, without laying a&s;ide their hypocri&s;y. The members were generally bent upon an alteration in the government. A few moderate men &s;ought only to a&s;certain the li|berties of the nation: others re&s;olved to humble and dimini&s;h the royal prero|gative; and there was a more violent party that extended their views to an utter extirpation of the hierarchy and monarchical government: but the&s;e at fir&s;t carefully concealed their de&s;igns under the profe&s;&s;ion of rigid pre&s;byterians, and were afterwards known by the name of independents. Religion was be|come a univer&s;al fa&s;hion. The mo&s;t eloquent &s;peakers in the hou&s;e introduced a kind of holy cant and jargon into their &s;peeches, and all their allu&s;ions being &s;criptural, &s;tamped them with an air of prophecy or in&s;piration.</P>

<P>In the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ions a great number of petitions were pre|&s;ented by individuals, as well as by multitudes of people, and numerous troops of hor&s;emen from different counties, craving redre&s;s of grievances both in church and &s;tate. Mr. Pym, member for Tavi&s;tock in Cornwal, &s;ignalized him&s;elf in a &s;et &s;peech$ recapitulating every grievance and &s;hadow of mi&s;con|duct of which the king's admini&s;tration had been accu&s;ed. He divided them into three heads, &s;uch as infringed the liberty of parliament, prejudiced reli|gion, and encroached upon the liberty of the &s;ubject. He compared the in|novations in religion to the parable of the dry bones in the prophecies of Ezekiel. They fir&s;t joined them&s;elves together: then came the &s;inews and $$$&s;h; the&s;e were afterwards covered with &s;kin; and at la&s;t the whole was in|&s;pired with the breath of life. He compla$n$d that members of parliament had been re$$$$ined from &s;peaking their &s;entiments; that &s;ome of them had been impri$$r$d, pro$ecut$d in in$erior courts, and d$$$ined in cu&s;tody for having &s;poken their opinions in the hou&s;e: that the $word$ had been forbidden to put the $ue$ti$n, and &s;everal parliaments abr$p$ly di&s;&s;olved; that the laws again&s;t papi&s;ts were &s;u&s;pended, and per&s;ons of that commu$ion favoured with places of tru&s;t and honour in the commonwealth: that they freely re&s;orted to court, in order to communicate their councils and de&s;igns; and that a nuncio publicly exerci&s;ed the pope's authority in England. He inveighed again&s;t the main|t$n$nce of popi&s;h tenets in books, $ermons, and di&s;put$s; the new ceremonies
<PB N="241" REF="2430">

Under the head of public grievances he re|capitulated the exaction of tonnage and poundage, compo&s;ition for knight|hood, impo&s;ition of &s;hip-money, arbitrary enlargement of fore&s;ts, &s;ale of nu|&s;ances by compounding for them, commi&s;&s;ion for building and depopulation, unlawful military charges levied by the king's warrant, letters of council, and orders of lieutenants of counties; extrajudicial declarations of judges, mono|polies, the court of Star-chamber, the king's edicts and proclamations for maintaining monopolies; the ambition and corruption of the clergy who preached up divine authority and ab&s;olute power in kings; and la&s;tly, the intermi&s;&s;ion of parliaments.

<P>The commons de&s;ired the lords to join in an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty for a fa&s;t, which was accordingly appointed. A committee was named to examine into the number of papi&s;ts in and about London. The lord Digby propo&s;ed a remon&s;trance on the grievances of the nation, which was po&s;tponed till ano|ther opportunity. The hou&s;e voted, that all tho&s;e members, who were con|cerned in monopolies, &s;hould be reputed unworthy of &s;eats in parliament. Among the petitions pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e, were tho&s;e of Prynne, Ba&s;twic, and Burton, who had undergone &s;uch rigorous puni&s;hment for libelling the government. By an arbitrary order of council they had been &s;everally exiled to Scilly, Jer&s;ey, and Guern&s;ey; excluded from all communication, and de|barred the u&s;e of pen, ink, and paper. The hou&s;e of commons now rever&s;ed the &s;entence, as illegal; and the judges were ordered to make reparation to the injured. When they landed in England, the people in crouds received them with loud acclamations. They were treated on the road with great magnifi|cence, and entered London in triumph, amid&s;t the warme&s;t demon&s;trations of popular affection. Lilburn, Leighton, Jennings, and Smart, who had been impri&s;oned for the &s;ame offence, were likewi&s;e relea&s;ed, and obtained damages of the judges and mini&s;ters. The hou&s;e eagerly li&s;tened to all petitions of people who had been aggrieved by the king's mini&s;ters, or complained of the innovations of the clergy. But their chief re&s;entment was levelled again&s;t archbi&s;hop Laud and the earl of Strafford, whom they con&s;idered as the mo&s;t dangerous enemies of puritani&s;m in church and &s;tate. On the eleventh day of November, Pym, after having de&s;ired that the doors of the hou&s;e might be locked, and the keys laid on the table, declared he had divers articles of com|plaint, which might amount to an impeachment for high trea&s;on again&s;t the earl of Strafford. A committee, having con&s;idered the charge in another apart|ment, reported that there was &s;ufficient ground for an accu&s;ation: then Pym was ordered to go up to the hou&s;e of peers, and impeach the earl of high trea|&s;on, in the name of the commons. He had fore&s;een this &s;torm, and propo&s;ed to the king that he &s;hould retire to his government of Ireland; but Charles tru&s;ted &s;o much to his capacity and attachment, that he in&s;i&s;ted upon his at|tendance, and promi&s;ed to defend him from the fury of the commons. He was no &s;ooner impeached than the lords committed him to the cu&s;tody of the
<PB N="242" REF="2440">
u&s;her of the black rod; and, in a few days, he was &s;ent to the Tower. Divers petitions having been delivered to the lower hou&s;e again&s;t Sir Francis Winde|bank, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, complaining that he had favoured the Roman catho|lics, and relea&s;ed &s;everal convicted prie&s;ts, he was &s;ummoned to appear and an&s;wer to the charge; but he thought proper to con&s;ult his &s;afety, by retiring to the continent.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>The commons, taking into con&s;ideration the new canons, the oath, and the tax upon the clergy, which had been enacted and impo&s;ed by the con|vocation, unanimou&s;ly voted that &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly had no power to frame con&s;titutions, canons, or any other acts, without con&s;ent of parliament: that the late canons contained matters contrary to the king's prerogative, the fun|damental laws of the kingdom, the rights of parliament, the liberty and pro|perty of the &s;ubjects; that therefore they tended to &s;edition, and were of the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences. Then they appointed a committee of nine and thirty members to inquire who were the principal promoters of tho&s;e canons; and to prepare an impeachment again&s;t the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, for hav|ing endeavoured to overturn the laws and religion of his country. The Scot|ti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, who acted in concert with the puritan party, at the &s;ame time pre&s;ented to the lords an accu&s;ation again&s;t this prelate, taxing him with being the author of all the troubles in Scotland, by impo&s;ing the book of ca|nons and the liturgy upon the natives of that kingdom, and exciting a war between his maje&s;ty and his &s;ubjects. The archbi&s;hop, being likewi&s;e im|peached by the commons, was taken into cu&s;tody, and afterwards committed to the Tower. Matthew Wren, bi&s;hop of Ely, being &s;u&s;pected of a de&s;ign to quit the kingdom, was obliged to give a &s;ecurity for ten thou&s;and pounds. The lord keeper Finch, being threatened with a pro&s;ecution, fled into Hol|land, and was declared a traitor by a vote of the commons; and the king committed the &s;eals to Sir Edward Lyttleton. Bramp&s;ton Davenport, and Crawley, three of the judges were obliged to give bail. Such was the me|thod taken to over-awe the king's mini&s;ters: but what &s;till more contri|buted to intimidate his adherents, was the practice of pa&s;&s;ing votes again&s;t any part of their conduct, as contrary to law.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; V.</HEAD>
<P>Petitions being pre&s;ented again&s;t tho&s;e who had been concerned in monopolies, innovations, or in any &s;hape in&s;trumental in promoting what was &s;tiled a grievance, the hou&s;e of commons examined and declared them delin|quents, as having committed offences for which they de&s;erved to be puni&s;hed according to law: con&s;equently they lay under the terror of a pro&s;ecution. A much greater number lived in daily apprehen&s;ion of falling under cognizance; &s;o that all the favourers of Charles were terrified into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and he was almo&s;t abandoned by his defendants. He found the torrent too &s;trong to be oppo&s;ed, and therefore acquie&s;ced in their mea&s;ures with a good grace; and indeed, from the beginning of this parliament, he &s;eems to have been &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to a reconciliation with the commons. The lord Falkland, having &s;poken with great energy again&s;t the impo&s;ition of &s;hip-money, the hou&s;e voted that this tax was levied contrary to the laws of the kingdom, the privileges of the &s;ubject, and the petition of right: that the opinions of the judges, who fa|voured that impo&s;ition, were contrary to the laws of the kingdom, the rights and property of the &s;ubject, the re&s;olutions of parliament, and the petition of
<PB N="243" REF="2450">
right: and that the king's orders, on that &s;ubject, were illegal in the &s;ame de|gree. A committee was appointed to examine the judges, and learn by whom and in what manner they were &s;olicited and threatened to give &s;uch an extra|judicial opinion. The committee for examining the right of the &s;ubject was ordered to draw up impeachments again&s;t lord keeper Finch and the re&s;t of the judges who had &s;ub&s;cribed tho&s;e opinions; to receive informations touching the refu&s;al of admitting per&s;ons to the benefit of the Habeas Corpus, the prohi|bitions, the extrajudicial opinions of the judges concerning the juri&s;diction of eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, and the court of admiralty, as well as their own illegal proceedings. The lords ordered the record of the judgment awarded again&s;t Mr. Hambden, in the affair of &s;hip-money, and the opinions of the judges on that affair, to be cancelled in their pre&s;ence; and this order paved the way for an act to aboli&s;h &s;hip-money, to which the king gave his a&s;&s;ent in the &s;equel.</P>

<P>The demagogues in the hou&s;e of commons had re&s;olved upon the abolition of the hierarchy. The pre&s;byterians hated the bi&s;hops, as their reli|gious enemies and per&s;ecutors. The republicans con&s;idered them as a dead weight in the hou&s;e of lords, that would always cau&s;e the royal &s;cale to pre|ponderate; for, they were to a man, devoted to the king and his prerogative. In order to pave the way for their exclu&s;ion from the upper hou&s;e, a great num|ber of petitions were procured again&s;t the prelates. One was pre&s;ented again&s;t archbi&s;hop Laud, in the name of Wil&s;on, a mini&s;ter whom he had &s;u&s;pended. Smart complained of having been deprived of his benefice, and impri&s;oned by the high commi&s;&s;ion, at the in&s;tigation of doctor Cozens dean of Durham, be|cau&s;e he would not conform to the innovations which that eccle&s;ia&s;tic had in|troduced. Smart was relea&s;ed, and Cozens declared a delinquent. The town of Banbury petitioned again&s;t innovations. Two inhabitants of Che&s;ter com|plained to the hou&s;e of their having been cruelly treated by the high commi&s;|&s;ion-court of York, becau&s;e they had vi&s;ited Prynne in the ca&s;tle of Caernarvon. A petition was pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e, &s;ub&s;cribed by a great number of per&s;ons in London, and &s;everal counties, containing eight and twenty grievances, ari&s;ing from epi&s;copal government. Addre&s;&s;es of the &s;ame kind were offered by the city of Glouce&s;ter; and &s;everal mini&s;ters of the Engli&s;h church. They were eagerly received by the commons, who nominated a committee to examine the juri&s;diction and proceedings of the two courts of high commi&s;&s;ion, in the pro|vinces of Canterbury and York; and another was e&s;tabli&s;hed, to take cognizance of the la&s;t convocation.</P>

<P>The king, alarmed at the&s;e tran&s;actions, repaired to the hou&s;e of peers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1641.</NOTE> where, in a &s;peech to the lords and commons, he recommended di&s;patch in pro|viding for the maintenance of the fleet and army: he told them, that he made a wide di&s;tinction between reforming and altering the government; that therefore, he could not con&s;ent to the exclu&s;ion of bi&s;hops from the upper hou&s;e; nor to a bill for triennial parliaments, which he under&s;tood the commons had under con&s;ideration. On that &s;ame day, a petition was pre&s;ented to them again&s;t Matthew Wren, who, while bi&s;hop of Norwich, had by oppre&s;&s;ion and innovation, compelled above fifty families of that city to retire to New-England. Then the hou&s;e deliberated upon the remon&s;trance of the mini&s;ters in London, again&s;t the bi&s;hops; and the right of prelates to &s;it in parliament.
<PB N="244" REF="2460">
Warm debates aro&s;e upon this la&s;t &s;ubject. The friends of epi&s;copacy affirmed, that prelates &s;at in parliament &s;ince the beginning of the con&s;titution, as the repre&s;entatives of the clergy: and the other party alledged, that they fir&s;t ob|tained &s;eats in parliament, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of temporal baronies, for which they did homage to the &s;overeign. Much learning and elocution was di&s;played on both &s;ides of the di&s;pute. On the thirteenth day of February, the hou&s;e or|dered a bill to be brought in for aboli&s;hing &s;uper&s;tition. On the fir&s;t day of March, a committee was e&s;tabli&s;hed to prepare rea&s;ons for depriving eccle&s;ia&s;tics of all &s;ecular employments; and on the ninth, another bill was ordered again&s;t pluralities. Upon the report of the committee appointed to examine the remon|&s;trance again&s;t the bi&s;hops, the hou&s;e voted, That the legi&s;lative and judiciary power of the bi&s;hops in the hou&s;e of peers, was a great ob&s;tacle to the di&s;charge of their &s;piritual functions, as well as prejudicial to the &s;tate; therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppre&s;s that power: and that a bill &s;hould be prepared for the purpo&s;e. The &s;ame vote was pa&s;&s;ed with re&s;pect to the judiciary power of bi|&s;hops, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tics in the commi&s;&s;ion of the peace, in the Star-Chamber, or in any other court of juri&s;diction. At length, a bill for exclud|ing eccle&s;i$&s;tics from all &s;ecular employments pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of commons; and was &s;ent up to the lords, among whom it met with great oppo&s;ition. The commons immediately brought in another bill for the total abolition of epi&s;co|pacy: then the lords gave them to under&s;tand, they were ready to concur with the fir&s;t bill, excepting the cl$$&s;e that deprived bi&s;hops of their &s;eats in parlia|ment. In a &s;ub&s;equent conference between the two hou&s;es, the lords declared, That they did not conceive this right of the bi&s;hops could be di&s;puted, either by the common or &s;tatute-law of the kingdom: nor did they &s;ee any inconvenience re&s;ulting from &s;uch right; though they were ready to concur with the commons in excluding them from &s;eats in the Star-Chamber and in the council, and from the exerci&s;e of all &s;ecular employments. Next day the lower hou&s;e pre&s;ented to the lords nine rea&s;ons for excluding bi&s;hops from parliament: and on the &s;eventh day of June, the peers voted, That the bi&s;hops &s;hould be maintained in their right to &s;it in parliament. On the fifteenth, the lower hou&s;e pa&s;&s;ed a vote, importing, That all deans, chapters, archdeacons, prebendaries, chanters, canons, and their officers, &s;hould be totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and their revenues em|ployed for the encouragement of &s;tudy, &s;cience, and other pious u&s;es: That the king &s;hould be indemnified for his rents, fir&s;t-fruits, and other rights: and, That a convenient &s;ub&s;i&s;tence &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned to tho&s;e who &s;hould be thus deprived of their livings, provided they were not delinquents.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the catholics did not e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed. The committee appointed to con&s;ider the king's proclamation again&s;t recu&s;ants, having reported that it did not an&s;wer the expectations of the hou&s;e, the com|mons de&s;ired the general of the army to di&s;mi&s;s all the officers that were papi&s;ts, and petitioned the king to deprive all catholic governors of their places. A re|mon&s;trance was prepared again&s;t the pope's nuncio Ro&s;etti, who re&s;ided in England, on pretence of being nece&s;&s;ary to the queen in matters of con&s;cience; and the ju&s;tices of the peace were ordered to pro&s;ecute recu&s;ants with all the rigour of the law. Several conferences were held between the two hou&s;es on the &s;ubject of one Goodman, a je&s;uit, who had been condemned to death and re&s;pited by the king. They pre&s;ented a joint-remon&s;trance to his maje&s;ty, de&s;ir|ing
<PB N="245" REF="2470">
he would not interrupt the execution of ju&s;tice upon this je&s;uit and apo&s;tate. Charles replied, That the death of Goodman might prejudice the prote&s;tants abroad. The man him&s;elf petitioned that he might be put to death rather than occa&s;ion any difference between the king and parliament; and the two hou&s;es, mollified perhaps by this generous reque&s;t, no longer in&s;i&s;ted upon his execu|tion. The commons having received information of &s;ome &s;ecret de&s;ign hatched by the papi&s;ts, ordered the mayor of London to prevent the re&s;ort of people to the chapels of the queen, and of foreign amba&s;&s;adors: a bill was brought into the hou&s;e for difarming all the papi&s;ts of the kingdom. The members exa|mined into the affair of the contribution which the catholics had rai&s;ed for the &s;upport of the war in Scotland. But the queen appea&s;ed them with a me&s;&s;age, owning &s;he had exerted her&s;elf for the relief of the king in his nece&s;&s;ities, pro|te&s;ting &s;he did not know that the methods &s;he u&s;ed were contrary to law; and a&s;&s;uring them &s;he would for the future act with more circum&s;pection. She like|wi&s;e promi&s;ed of her own accord, that Ro&s;etti &s;hould be &s;ent back to his own country; but, delaying the performance of this promi&s;e until their patience was exhau&s;ted, they ordered him to be brought to the bar, that he might be in|terrogated; and he retired to the continent with great precipitation. Father Philippe, the queen's confe&s;&s;or, was examined by the commons, who &s;ent to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nal&s;on. Ru&s;hworth.

<P>This vigour of the commons was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the Scotti&s;h army that &s;till remained at Newca&s;tle. The earl of Rothes and lord Loudon, who were their chief deputies in negotiating the treaty, maintained an intimate corre&s;pondence with the leading men in the lower hou&s;e, and greatly influenced their mea&s;ures. Tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners were magnificently lodged in the city of London, clo&s;e by St. Antholin's church, which was a&s;&s;igned to them as a place of devotion, where their chaplains publicly practi&s;ed the pre&s;|byterian form of wor&s;hip; and by their preaching acquired great popularity among the Engli&s;h puritans. Their prayers and &s;ermons were no other than rhap|$odies of unintelligible jargon, which was wonderfully adapted to the ignorant fanatici&s;m that then prevailed in all parts of the nation. The hou&s;e of commons appointed a committee to renew the treaty of Rippon with the Scotti&s;h commi&s;|&s;ioners; and an order was entered, that upon all occa&s;ions they &s;hould receive the appellation of Our Brethren of Scotland. It was re&s;olved, That the Scotti&s;h as well as the Engli&s;h army, &s;hould be payed by the parliament: two &s;ub&s;idies were granted for this purpo&s;e; and in the mean time, money was borrowed in the city of London, on the credit of particular members. A poll-tax, and other &s;upplies, were afterwards levied; but not &s;ufficient to defray the whole expence. They fore&s;aw, that the parliament's being in debt, would be a good rea&s;on for continuing the &s;e&s;&s;ion. They looked upon the Scots as their confederates, who&s;e pre&s;ence kept the king in &s;ubjection; and they determined to retain tho&s;e invaders, until they &s;hould have wholly &s;ubdued the royal prerogative.</P>

<P>This was actually the ca&s;e: in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion Charles gave his a&s;&s;ent to an act e&s;tabli&s;hing triennial parliaments; another to aboli&s;h the Star-chamber and high-commi&s;&s;ion; a third for reducing fore&s;ts to their an|tient bounds in the reign of Edward I. a fourth repealing the &s;tatutes con|cerning knighthood, which had pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of the &s;econd Edward;

a$d a fi$th for aboli&s;hing the tax of &s;hip-money. The common$, in granting the tonnage and poundage, voted the&s;e duties for two months only, and after|wards renewed their grant from time to time, that they might convince the king of his having no independent right to a&s;&s;ume them, without the con&s;ent of parliament. The mar&s;hal's-court, the &s;tannary-court, together with the councils of the North, and of Wales, were aboli&s;hed, as illegal and oppre&s;&s;ive$ The nation expre&s;&s;ed great joy at the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions of the king, who now found him&s;elf abandoned by his adherents, and had the mortification to &s;ee the Scots care&s;&s;ed by the Parliament, which, in&s;tead of enabling him to drive them as rebels out of England, now pre&s;ented them with three hundred thou|&s;and pounds, as a recompence for having invaded the kingdom. In a word, he was obliged to grant all their demands, in a treaty which was ratified by the parliaments of both nations. Charles, with a view to render the popular leaders propitious to his government, and more placable with regard to the earl of Strafford, admitted into his council the earls of Hertford, Bedford, E&s;&s;ex, Bri&s;tol, and Warwick; the lords Say, Saville, and Kimbolton. Juxon bi&s;hop of London, the friend of Laud, re&s;igned the trea&s;urer's &s;taff: Oliver St. John<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$$$orth.</NOTE> was appointed &s;olicitor-general. The king intended that Hollis &s;ho $d fill the place of &s;ecretary, vacated by the flight of Windebank: that Pym &s;hould be made chancellor of the exchequer, in the room of lord Cottington, who had re&s;igned; lord Say ma&s;ter of the wards; the earl of E&s;&s;ex governor, and Mr. Hambden tutor to the prince: but this total change in the mini&s;try was prevented by the king's under&s;tanding that tho&s;e per&s;ons would not alter their mea&s;ures, in con&s;equence of their promotion.</P>

<P>The &s;acrifices he had already made, did not one moment retard the pro&s;ecution of Strafford. That nobleman was con&s;idered as the chief &s;upport of the prerogative: the commons looked upon him as an apo&s;tate; and the Scots hated him, as the implacable and avowed enemy of their country. A committee of thirteen was cho&s;en by the lower hou&s;e, to prepare the charge again&s;t him; and the&s;e were joined to a committee of the lords, authorized to examine witne&s;&s;es and papers touching any part of the earl's conduct. They likewi&s;e took an oath of &s;ecrecy, that the earl might find the greater difficulty in eluding their enquiries, and in preparing for his defence. The king too ra&s;hly con&s;ented to their examining privy-coun&s;ellors upon opinions delivered at the board. Sir George Ratcliffe, the earl's friend and confident, was ac|cu&s;ed of high trea&s;on, brought from Ireland and committed to pri&s;on, that Strafford might be deprived of his intimate friend, who was be&s;t able to ju&s;tify his conduct. The Iri&s;h hou&s;e of commons &s;ent over a committee to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the pro&s;ecution of this unfortunate nobleman, who had been their governor; and, in a word, the three kingdoms &s;eemed bent upon his de&s;truction. The articles of his impeachment, amounting to eight and twenty, charged him with having exerci&s;ed illegal arbitrary power and oppre&s;&s;ion in many in&s;tances, both as pre&s;ident of the North, and as lord lieutenant of Ireland: with having been the cau&s;e of the war with the Scots, again&s;t whom he had unju&s;tly irritated his maje&s;ty: with having levied an army of Iri&s;h papi&s;ts to en&s;lave the king|dom: and with having advi&s;ed the king to e&s;tabli&s;h an ab&s;olute government on the ruins of the con&s;titution. We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall was formed into a large cou$t $word$ judicature for this important trial. The earl of Arundel pre&s;ided as lord
<PB N="247" REF="2490">
high &s;teward, the peers &s;at in their robes as judges, and the commons as ac|cu&s;ers; but the bi&s;hops withdrew, according to cu&s;tom, becau&s;e forbidden by the canons to a&s;&s;i&s;t at any trial for life. At the upper end was a chair and cloth of &s;tate for the king, and on each &s;ide a clo&s;e gallery, in which his maje&s;ty and the queen &s;at in private. Whitelock was appointed chairman of the committee appointed to conduct the impeachment. The trial began on the twenty-&s;econd day of March. The articles of accu&s;ation were inforced with all the virulence of malice, and all the energy of eloquence. The earl behaved with great dignity, courage, and compo&s;ure. His defence was noble, &s;pirited, and effectual. He acquitted him&s;elf of every imputation, except a few acrimonious expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;ome in&s;tances of indi&s;cretion, which ought to have been forgiven, as the infirmities of human nature. Nothing had ap|peared again&s;t him to ju&s;tify the charge of trea&s;on, when, on the twelfth day of April, Pym produced, in the hou&s;e of commons, a paper of &s;ome notes taken by &s;ecretary Vane, of opinions delivered at the council-table. Young Vane pretended that he had found them by accident in his father's cabinet; and, as they were thought to bear te&s;timony again&s;t the earl, his accu&s;ers next day read them openly at his trial. They were intitled, No dan|ger of a war with Scotland, if offen&s;ive, not defen&s;ive. The earl had advi&s;ed the king to borrow a &s;um of money of the city of London, and to levy &s;hip|money. He &s;aid his maje&s;ty was ab&s;olved from all rule of government, as having tried all legal ways, and been repul&s;ed; and that he had an army in Ireland, which he might employ to reduce this kingdom to obedience. The earl, in his defence ob&s;erved, that it was hard mea&s;ure to be pro&s;ecuted under the notion of trea&s;on for opinions given in council: that his u&s;ing the expre&s;&s;ion "this kingdom," was not proved, as the marquis of Hamilton, the earl of Northumberland, the lord trea&s;urer, and the lord Cottington, who were pre&s;ent at the board, declared, upon their honours, that they never heard him &s;peak &s;uch words; but granting he had u&s;ed the expre&s;&s;ion, the word This, could not rationally imply England, which had not been guilty of di&s;obedience, but Scotland, which was the immediate &s;ubject of their de|liberation, and in a &s;tate of actual rebellion. After having made this an&s;wer, he recapitulated the &s;everal parts of his former defence; and, in conclu&s;ion, &s;aid, <Q>&startq;My lords, I have troubled you longer than I &s;hould have done, were it not for the intere&s;t of the&s;e dear pledges a &s;aint in heaven hath left me.&endq;</Q>&mdash;Here he made a pau&s;e, pointing to his children, and &s;hedding &s;ome tears, then proceeded in the&s;e words: <Q>&startq;What I forfeit my&s;elf is nothing; but that my indi&s;cretion &s;hould extend to my po&s;terity woundeth me to the very &s;oul&mdash;You will pardon my infirmity; &s;omething I &s;hould have added, but am not able, therefore let it pa&s;s:&mdash;and now my lords, for my&s;elf, I have been taught, by the ble&s;&s;ing of Almighty God, that the afflictions of this pre&s;ent life are not to be compared to the eternal weight of glory, which &s;hall be revealed hereafter: and &s;o, my lords, even &s;o, with all tranquillity of mind, I freely &s;ubmit my&s;elf to your judgment, and whether that judgment be of life or death, Te Deum Laudamus.&endq;</Q> The very chairman of the committee who managed the impeachment, &s;ays this great and good per&s;on &s;poke with &s;uch pathetic grace and eloquence as moved the hearts of all his auditors (a few excepted) to pity and remor&s;e.</P>

<P>He and his coun&s;el produced &s;uch weighty arguments in his defence, that the commons &s;aw no pro&s;pect of his de&s;truction but by bill of attainder, which pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e on the twenty-fir&s;t day of April, after a &s;harp debate, and was immediately &s;ent up to the lords. On the fir&s;t day of May, the king a&s;&s;embling both hou&s;es, pa&s;&s;ionately reque&s;ted that they would not proceed &s;everely again&s;t the earl of Strafford, whom, in his own con&s;cience, he could not condemn of high trea&s;on; but that for his mi&s;demeanours he &s;hould never &s;erve him, nor the commonwealth, in any place of tru&s;t, no not &s;o much as a con&s;table. Next day the nuptials of the prince of Orange and the prince&s;s Mary were &s;olemnized; and the popular mini&s;ters preached up the nece&s;&s;ity of ju&s;tice upon &s;ome great delinquents. On the third, a va&s;t multitude of the populace from the city appeared at We&s;tmin&s;ter, armed with &s;words and cudgels, crying aloud for ju&s;tice again&s;t the earl of Strafford. They pretended decay of trade, and want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and pa&s;ted up at We&s;tmin&s;ter the names of all tho&s;e members of parliament who had voted for the earl. A na|tional prote&s;tation to maintain the prote&s;tant religion again&s;t popery; to defend the king's per&s;on, the power of parliament, and the rights and liberties of the &s;ubject, was taken by the lords and commons, and impo&s;ed upon all the people of England. A bill was brought in for continuing this parliament, which &s;hould not be prorogued, adjourned, or di&s;&s;olved, without the con&s;ent of both hou&s;es, until the grievances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed, but have credit to take up money. A majority of the peers voted the earl of Strafford guilty of high trea&s;on. The king being addre&s;&s;ed upon the act of attainder, and the other bill, was involved in the utmo&s;t anxiety. His coun&s;ellors advi&s;ed him to give up the earl, in order to appea&s;e the enraged people. Strafford him&s;elf, in a letter, gallantly exhorted his maje&s;ty to &s;acrifice him to a reconciliation with his &s;ubjects. The queen, who was no friend to the earl, and terrified with the thoughts of a rebellion, u&s;ed all her influence in per&s;uading him to comply with the demands of his parliament. Thus perplexed, and bated with importuni|ties, he commi&s;&s;ioned three lords to pa&s;s the bills, which deprived Strafford of life, and him&s;elf of authority. When &s;ecretary Carleton informed the earl of this tran&s;action, he &s;tarted up from his chair, with marks of extreme a&s;toni&s;h|ment, and laying his hand upon his brea&s;t, exclaimed, <Q>&startq;Put not your tru&s;t in princes, nor in the &s;ons of men; for in them there is no &s;alvation.&endq;</Q> Charles was immediately &s;eized with remor&s;e for what he had done, and &s;ent a letter by the prince to the hou&s;e of lords, intreating them to confer with the commons, that the life of Strafford might be &s;pared; but they paid no regard to his reque&s;t.</P>

<P>The parliament was now more than ever exa&s;perated by the di&s;|covery of two de&s;igns which were &s;aid to be countenanced by his maje&s;ty. One was to forward the e&s;cape of Strafford, by means of captain Billing&s;ley, who came with two hundred men, and a warrant from the king, to be admitted into the Tower; but Sir William Balfour the lieutenant, &s;u&s;pecting his inten|tion, would not receive the reinforcement. Balfour him&s;elf was tampered with, and might have been gratified with a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, for conniving at the earl's elopement; but he was &s;o &s;trongly attached to his countrymen the covenanters, that he rejected the offer, and communicated the tran&s;action to the popular men among the commons. The other de&s;ign was an a&s;&s;ociation
<PB N="249" REF="2510">
of the officers in the army to defend the king's per&s;on and government again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;eemed bent upon overturning the con&s;titution in church and &s;tate. The per&s;ons chiefly concerned in this affair, were the lord Piercy, Jermyn, O Neale, Goring, Wilmot, Pollard, and A&s;hburnham, who enjoyed com|mi&s;&s;ions in the army. They were piqued at &s;ome marks of partiality which the commons had exhibited in favour of the Scots; and no doubt they were fired with indignation to &s;ee their monarch &s;o rigorou&s;ly treated by this par|liament. They drew up the form of a petition to the king and parliament, to be &s;ub&s;cribed by the army, which therein promi&s;ed to come up and guard his maje&s;ty and the two hou&s;es, from the danger of tumults excited by male|contents, and vindicate the nation from innovations. This draught was coun|ter&s;igned by the initial letters of the king's name, in token of his approbation. Goring, who was governor of Port&s;mouth, betrayed the &s;ecret to the leading men in the lower hou&s;e. Pym communicated the intelligence in an inflamma|tory &s;peech. Piercy and Jermyn fled immediately to the continent. Goring was examined at the bar of the hou&s;e, and confe&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;ociators had bound them&s;elves by an oath of &s;ecrecy; and, though this circum&s;tance was &s;till de|nied by Pollard, Wilmot, and A&s;hburnham, Piercy confirmed it, in a letter to his brother the earl of Northumberland. It was con&s;idered as a very dan|gerous con&s;piracy; and on this occa&s;ion the prote&s;tation had been &s;igned by all the members of both hou&s;es, except Southampton and Roberts. To keep up the ferment of the people, fre&s;h alarms were every day &s;ounded. A great con|cour&s;e of papi&s;ts was &s;aid to be a&s;&s;embled in Lanca&s;hire: the malecontents of that communion were reported to meet in Surry, and con&s;pire in &s;ubterranean caverns. Some ridiculous plots were feigned for the purpo&s;e of irritating the populace; and rumours of inva&s;ions and in&s;urrections carefully circulated. The people thus inflamed, blazed out in violence and riot; they crouded about the palace of Whitehall, and demanded ju&s;tice with the mo&s;t outrageous me|naces and clamour.</P>

<P>In &s;uch a &s;tate of anarchy and in&s;urrection, no wonder that little regard was payed to the king's interpo&s;ition in favour of Strafford. On the twelfth day of May, that unhappy nobleman was brought to the &s;caffold on Tower-hill; and, as he pa&s;&s;ed by the apartments of the archbi&s;hop, he &s;poke to him at the window, intreating the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his prayers. Laud, &s;um|moning all his fortitude, encouraged the noble &s;ufferer with &s;piritual comfort, admini&s;tred with a chearful voice and confident expre&s;&s;ion. Thus animated, the earl appeared in his la&s;t &s;cene with that &s;erenity which is the effect of true courage and internal peace. He expre&s;&s;ed his fears that a reformation, begun with the &s;hedding of innocent blood, would not have a happy i&s;&s;ue. He declared his attachment to the prote&s;tant religion, as profe&s;&s;ed in the church of Eng|land; his loyalty to the king, and affection to the peace and welfare of the kingdom. Having bid farewell to his brother and friends; <Q>&startq;And now (&s;aid he) one &s;troke will make my wife a widow, my dear children fatherle&s;s, de|prive my poor &s;ervants of their indulgent ma&s;ter, and &s;eparate me from my affectionate brother and all my friends.&endq;</Q>&mdash;In preparing him&s;elf for the blo$k, <Q>&startq;I thank God $added he) that I am no way afraid of death, nor am daunted with any terrors; but do as chearfully lay down my head at this time, as ever I did when going to repo&s;e.&endq;</Q> So &s;aying, he &s;ubmitted his
<PB N="250" REF="2520">
neck to the executioner, who at one &s;troke &s;evered his head from his body. Such was the fate of Sir Thomas Wentworth earl of Strafford, a nobleman of rare talents, invincible courage, and un&s;haken fidelity: but proud, contemptu|ous, arbitrary, and overbearing. He had, without doubt, advi&s;ed the king to maintain his authority by force of arms; but he was altogether innocent and unconcerned in tho&s;e mea&s;ures by which Charles had involved him&s;elf in &s;uch<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> a labyrinth of trouble and perplexity. Tho&s;e had been devi&s;ed and practi&s;ed before he had any &s;hare in the admini&s;tration; and the bill of attainder by which he fell, is a &s;tanding reproach upon both hou&s;es of parliament.</P>

<P>The king was extremely &s;hocked at the death of Strafford, and thought he had every thing to fear from the violence of tho&s;e men who had al|ready treated him with &s;uch cruelty and contempt. In&s;pired with this appre|hen&s;ion, he re&s;olved to appea&s;e them with all &s;orts of conde&s;cen&s;ion. It was at this period that the tax of &s;hip-money and the Star-chamber were aboli&s;hed. Wilmot, A&s;hburnham, and Pollard, were expelled the hou&s;e and impri&s;oned, for having been concerned in the con&s;piracy to &s;educe the army. All the taxes which the king had impo&s;ed, the exten&s;ion of the fore&s;ts, and the practice of impri&s;oning tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to comply with &s;uch impo&s;itions, were voted contrary to law; and the greater part of monopolies was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. It was likewi&s;e at this juncture that they pa&s;&s;ed the bill again&s;t pluralities, condemned the canons, and oath framed by the la&s;t convocation; carried up an accu&s;ation to the lords again&s;t thirteen bi&s;hops, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at that a&s;&s;embly; aboli&s;hed the high commi&s;&s;ion. Dr. Wren bi&s;hop of Norwich, for having introduced innovations, and &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies in the church, was voted unworthy and unfit to hold or exerci&s;e any office or dignity in church or commonwealth; and the lords, at the de&s;ire of the lower hou&s;e, committed him to the Tower: voted the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of deans and chapters, and ordered all the &s;ubjects to &s;ub|&s;cribe the prote&s;tation. Lord Digby, &s;on to the earl of Bri&s;tol, who had been formerly in the oppo&s;ition, but lately di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the defence of Strafford, was now called up to the hou&s;e of peers, and became the king's chief mini&s;ter and confident. When the commons demanded that the Iri&s;h army &s;hould be di&s;banded, the king gave them to under&s;tand, that he had pro|mi&s;ed to &s;end four thou&s;and men into the Spani&s;h &s;ervice. The lower hou&s;e petitioned his maje&s;ty that he would retract his promi&s;e; and he in&s;i&s;ting upon the performance of it, as an affair in which his honour was engaged, they pu|bli&s;hed a declaration, importing, That every per&s;on concerned in tran&s;porting the Iri&s;h troops to foreign parts, &s;hould be regarded as an enemy to the &s;tate. This &s;tep effectually fru&s;trated the king's intention; for no &s;hip-ma&s;ter would<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> expo&s;e him&s;elf to inevitable ruin, by embarking in &s;uch &s;ervice.</P>

<P>The treaty with the Scots being brought to a conclu&s;ion, Charles allowed the parliament of Scotland to a&s;&s;emble, and declared his intention of a&s;&s;i&s;ting at it in per&s;on. The commons &s;u&s;pecting that he de&s;igned to put him&s;elf at the head of his army in the north, on pretence of vi&s;iting his kingdom of Scotland, demanded a conference with the lords, and propo&s;ed that both armies &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed before his departure; which the king, at their reque&s;t, po&s;tponed till the tenth day of Augu&s;t. Both were accordingly di&s;|banded at the &s;ame time, and the Scots returned to their own country, very well &s;atisfied with their expedition. Then he &s;et out upon his journey; but their
<PB N="251" REF="2530">
di&s;tru&s;t &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, they propo&s;ed that a committee from both hou&s;es &s;hould attend the king in Scotland, on pretence of conferring with the Scotti&s;h par|liament, though in reality to be &s;pies upon his maje&s;ty's conduct. The earl of Bedford being nominated as one of the peers, declined the office; &s;o that lord Howard of E&s;crick was the only member of that hou&s;e who undertook the journey; and of the commons, the committee con&s;i&s;ted of Nathaniel Fiennes, Sir William Armyne, Sir Philip Stapleton, and John Hambden. The commons &s;till continued &s;itting, and took &s;everal grievances into con&s;ideration. Then they re&s;olved to adjourn from the ninth day of September till the twentieth of October. This re&s;olution was no &s;ooner taken, than a great number of members from both hou&s;es retired to the country; and &s;ome rigid pre&s;byteri|ans took this opportunity to propo&s;e an alteration in the book of Common Prayer; which was &s;o vigorou&s;ly defended by Mr. Hyde, afterwards earl of Clarendon, that no &s;tep was taken on the &s;ubject. The lords, during this di&s;pute, voted that the book of Common Prayer &s;hould be u&s;ed without any alteration. This vote produced a conference between the hou&s;es. The com|mons de&s;ired the lords would concur with them in publi&s;hing a declaration for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all the late innovations in the church, and all diver&s;ions on the Lord's Day. The lords, on the other hand, demanded the concurrence of the commons, in publi&s;hing an order of their hou&s;e, proh biting all change in di|vine wor&s;hip as e&s;tabli&s;hed by law. The lower hou&s;e ab&s;olutely rejected this propo&s;al, and ordered their declaration to be printed and publi&s;hed through the whole kingdom. They at the &s;ame time appointed a committee of three and forty members to manage affairs of importance during their adjournment: the lords e&s;tabli&s;hed another for their hou&s;e; and then the parliament adjourned<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth.

<P>The king, attended by the duke of Lennox, lately honoured with the additional title of Richmond, the marquis of Hamilton, and the lord Willoughby, travelled po&s;t to Edinburgh, where he found it convenient to acquie&s;ce in every thing which the parliament of Scotland propo&s;ed. James Graham earl of Montro&s;e was at that time a pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle of Edin|burgh, through the influence of Argyle, who was his rival in popularity and ambition. During the treaty of Rippon, Montro&s;e, though at fir&s;t a cove|nanter, had conveyed a letter to the king, containing a&s;&s;urances of inviolable fidelity: and this being di&s;covered, he was ever after &s;u&s;pected, and odious to the pre&s;byterian party. He afterwards engaged the earls of Mare&s;chal, Wigton, Athol, Mar, and many other noblemen, in an a&s;&s;ociation to maintain the royal authority. This tran&s;piring, he and his confederates were &s;ummoned before a committee of the &s;tates, when they declared they had no de&s;ign to un|dertake any thing to the detriment of the public. The earl was again &s;um|moned by the parliament, which ordered him to be confined in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh, where he now remained. The king, in order to conciliate the af|fection of the Scotti&s;h nation, promoted Argyle to the dignity of a marquis, Loudon to an earldom; general Le&s;ley was created earl of Leve$; Hender|&s;on, Gille&s;py, and other popular preachers, were gratified with pen&s;ions. In parliament, the lords of the articles were &s;et a&s;ide. A law was enacted to pre|vent foreigners from being created peers of Scotland, without proper qualifica|tion,
<PB N="252" REF="2540">
&s;uch as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing e&s;tates in the kingdom. A bill for triennial parliaments was pa&s;&s;ed; and it was decreed that no member of the privy-council, judge, or officer of &s;tate, &s;hould be appointed without the approbation of parliament. The lord Henry Ker, &s;on to the earl of Roxburgh, &s;ent a challenge to the marquis of Hamilton by the earl of Crawford, defying him to &s;ingle combat, as a traitor to God, to his king, and his country: the marquis complained of his in&s;olence to the king and the parliament, before whom he was obliged to a&s;k pardon on his knees. Immediately after this di&s;turbance was appea&s;ed, Hamilton and Argyle withdrew them&s;elves abruptly from parliament, on pretence that a plot was formed again&s;t their lives, by the earl of Crawford, and &s;ome other gentlemen, who were immediately confined; but, upon inquiry, it was found a fal&s;e alarm, probably concerted between the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners then at Edinburgh, and the two marqui&s;&s;es, to keep up the di&s;quiets of both<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> nations.</P>

<P>Intelligence of this pretended con&s;piracy being conveyed to Pym, chairman of the committee appointed to &s;it during the rece&s;s of parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> the hou&s;es no &s;ooner met, than he made a report of this affair. The commons immediately demanded a conference with the lords, to whom they repre&s;ented their fears of a dangerous con&s;piracy by papi&s;ts in Scotland; then propo&s;ed that the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;hould be &s;trictly guarded, and the king|dom be put in a po&s;ture of defence. The peers a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al; and both hou&s;es demanded a guard of the earl of E&s;&s;ex, whom the king had lately appointed general of the forces to the &s;outh of the river Trent. Next day warm debates aro&s;e in the hou&s;e of commons, touching the declaration which they had publi&s;hed before the adjournment, and which many per&s;ons refu&s;ed to obey, alledging that &s;uch an order could not have the force of a law. The next &s;ubjects that engro&s;&s;ed their attention, was the pro&s;ecution of the bi&s;hops who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the la&s;t convocation; and the bill for excluding all pre|lates from &s;itting in parliament. In a conference with the lords, Pym made a &s;peech again&s;t the bi&s;hops; and afterwards St. John explained the rea&s;ons for an act to aboli&s;h their votes in parliament. He &s;aid they had no inherent right as temporal lords, who are peers of the kingdom, becau&s;e they were not the repre&s;entatives of any cla&s;s, not even of the clergy, who were otherwi&s;e re|pre&s;ented in the convocation; becau&s;e they could not act as temporal lords in cau&s;es of life and death; and &s;everal acts had pa&s;&s;ed in former reigns, without their con&s;ent, &s;uch as that of Elizabeth, touching the book of Common Prayer. In the reign of Henry VIII. and in the ca&s;e of Dr. Standi&s;h, the judges declared, that the king had a power to convoke a parliament, without &s;ending writs to the bi&s;hops. In the time of Edward I. the clergy had been excluded from a parliament held at Carlile. It does not appear from antient records that prelates voted in affairs which concerned the clergy; for they either import that the king having con&s;ulted with the earls, barons, and other nobles, gave his a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch an act; or that <Q>&startq;The act was pa&s;&s;ed with the con&s;ent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru$$worth.</NOTE> of the earls, barons, and other laymen,&endq;</Q> without any mention of the bi&s;hops. This &s;cheme of exclu&s;ion met with &s;uch oppo&s;ition in the hou&s;e of lords, where the bi&s;hops them&s;elves voted, that it was po&s;tponed to another op|portunity.</P>

<P>Had the leading men in the oppo&s;ition entertained no other de&s;ign but that of redre&s;&s;ing the grievances of the nation, and a&s;certaining the liberties of the people, their aim was now accompli&s;hed, and they would have re&s;ted content with the triumphs they had obtained over the prerogative. But their views &s;eem to have extended with their &s;ucce&s;s: they re&s;olved to humble the king in &s;uch a manner, that he &s;hould never have it in his power to puni&s;h them for the mortifications to which they had &s;ubjected him. They determined to aboli&s;h the hierarchy, not only as the con&s;tant &s;upport of monarchical go|vernment, but al&s;o as the bulwark and mound that oppo&s;ed the tide of purita|ni&s;m, which now bade &s;o fair for overflowing the three kingdoms. The chiefs, who managed the machines of oppo&s;ition in both hou&s;es, were the earl of E&s;&s;ex, the lords Say and Kimbolton, for the peers; Pym, Hambden, St. John, Fiennes, Vane, and Hollis, for the commons. E&s;&s;ex was a popular nobleman, of &s;olid &s;en&s;e and great authority in parliament: vanity and ambition were his predominant foibles; and his conduct was in a good mea&s;ure influenced by private animo&s;ity again&s;t the court, where he had been but indifferently treated. Lord vi&s;count Say was clo&s;e, ambitious, a bigotted puritan, and an indefatigable &s;tickler again&s;t the arbitrary mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try. The lord Kimbolton had acquired great popularity by his good nature, genero&s;ity, and in&s;inuating addre&s;s. He di&s;|approved of the court maxims from principle, and attached him&s;elf to the op|po&s;ite party, with which he was in high e&s;timation. Pym had more experience in parliament than any other member: he was a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, reflection, and &s;agacity, tinctured with republican principles, though not in&s;pired with the fury of fanatici&s;m. John Hambden po&s;&s;e&s;$ed a great &s;hare of courage, cun|ning, and di&s;cernment; &s;poke with great art and energy in the hou&s;e of com|mons, and concealed the mo&s;t enterprizing genius under the cloak of diffidence, humility, and moderation. St. John was a natural &s;on of the hou&s;e of Boling|broke, and a lawyer by profe&s;&s;ion. He had parts and indu&s;try; but was dark, cloudy, and re&s;erved, proud, and revengeful; an enemy to the church from principle, and a foe to the court from re&s;entment; for he had been impri&s;oned on &s;u&s;picion of &s;editious practices. Nathaniel Fiennes, &s;econd &s;on of the lord Say, inherited his father's principles both in politics and religion. He had acquired a good &s;hare of learning in the univer&s;ity of Oxford; &s;pent &s;ome time in Geneva, Switzerland, and Scotland, where he was confirmed in his aver&s;ion to the church of England, and at length became a popular &s;peaker in the hou&s;e of commons. Sir Henry Vane, &s;on to the &s;ecretary, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great na|tural talents, and the mo&s;t profound di&s;&s;imulation. His conception was quick and penetrating, and he &s;poke with great weight and facility. He had &s;tudied in Magdalen-college at Oxford, and afterwards travelled to Geneva, where he contracted the mo&s;t rancorous hatred to the di&s;cipline and liturgy of the Engli&s;h church. He made a voyage to New-England, that he might enjoy liberty of con&s;cience; and, upon his return to England, was appointed joint-trea&s;urer of the navy: but he was incen&s;ed again&s;t the earl of Strafford, by that nobleman's procuring for him&s;elf the title of baron Raby, an hou&s;e belonging to the Vane family, and pro&s;ecuted him with all the bitter|ne&s;s of revenge. In this pur&s;uit he cultivated the friend&s;hip of Pym and his a&s;&s;ociates, and &s;oon acquired the confidence of the whole party. But no one of the demagogues was more valued and e&s;teemed than Denzil Hollis, brother to the earl of Clare, a per&s;on of rare accompli&s;hments and unblemi&s;hed cha|racter. He had formerly oppo&s;ed the court and the duke of Buckingham,

To the&s;e leaders, Sir Gilbert Gerard, Strode, Ha&s;ler$gg, Hotham, Cho$mley, and Stapleton$ were &s;ubordinate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$$ren$on.</NOTE> obeying their dictates with the mo&s;t implicit regard. The commons, not &s;atisfied with the conce&s;&s;ions they had already extorted from their &s;overeign, and planning &s;till further alterations in the con&s;titution, &s;eemed now apprehen|&s;ive of the king's reconciling him&s;elf intirely with his people. In order to blow up the embers of their animo&s;ity, they re&s;olved to draw up and publi&s;h a re|mon&s;trance of the &s;tate of the kingdom, in which they might recapitulate with exaggerations every in&s;tance of mi&s;conduct, and each arbitrary mea&s;ure charge|able upon the king &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, and alarm the nation with imaginary dangers. This they imagined would provoke the king to take &s;ome &s;tep that would produce a new quarrel, and furni&s;h them with a presence for po&s;tponing the &s;ettlement of his revenues, which the king expected in return for all his conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>

<P>While the committee was employed in compo&s;ing this famous re|mon&s;trance, their work was interrupted by an unexpected incident of &s;uch im|portance, as claimed their whole attention: this was the rebellion in Ireland. The old Roman catholic Iri&s;h had, by the increa&s;e of puritani&s;m in that king|dom, been of late treated with great rigour in point of religion; &s;o that their inveteracy again&s;t the prote&s;tant planters was inflamed with fre&s;h rancour. When they reflected on the &s;tate of England, where the con&s;titution was un|hinged, and the power of the &s;overeign almo&s;t annihilated by the factious com|mons; when they con&s;idered, that the three armies in England, Scotland, and Ireland, were di&s;banded, except an handful of troops &s;cattered up and down their own country in &s;ingle companies; they thought the pre&s;ent conjuncture was the faire&s;t opportunity they &s;hould ever enjoy for retrieving their antient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the exerci&s;e of their religion. They were quickened by the apprehen&s;ion of further per&s;ecution from the puritanical &s;pi|rit of the times; for the Scotti&s;h covenanters, and their brethren of England, had publicly threatened to exterminate the papi&s;ts of Ireland. They were ani|mated by &s;eeing the &s;ucce&s;s of the Scots, who had reduced the king to a com|pliance with all their demands. They were exhorted by their prie&s;ts to ri&s;e in defence of their religion and liberty; they were encouraged with hope of &s;uc|cour by cardinal Richelieu; and their countrymen, who &s;erved in foreign armies, promi&s;ed to di&s;cipline and conduct them in &s;uch a laudable enterprize. The prote&s;tants in Ireland were but a handful in compari&s;on with the number of the natives, among whom they lived in the mo&s;t &s;upine &s;ecurity. There was a magazine of arms, ammunition, and artillery at Dublin, almo&s;t quite un|guarded; and Sir William Par&s;ons, and Sir John Borlace, the lords ju&s;tices, were altogether unequal to the ta&s;k of government which they had undertaken. All the&s;e con&s;iderations occurred to Roger More, a man of valour and capa|city, who inculcated them upon the lord Maguire and Sir Phelim Oneal, two of the mo&s;t powerful Iri&s;h chieftains. In a word, all the native Iri&s;h were en|gaged in a con&s;piracy to expel the Engli&s;h. They re&s;olved to ri&s;e throughout all the provinces in one day, and attack the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements; and lord Maguire, with Roger More, undertook to &s;urpri&s;e the ca&s;tle of Dublin. All the preparations were made for this in&s;urrection; Maguire and More had al|ready
<PB N="255" REF="2570">
repaired to Dublin with a good number of their confederates, and intended to attack the ca&s;tle in the morning. One Oconnolly, a prote&s;tant, di&s;covered the &s;ecret to the ju&s;tices, who forthwith retired into the ca&s;tle with a rein|forcement, and alarmed the city: Maguire was taken, but Roger More e&s;ca|ped. This di&s;covery did not prevent the general in&s;urrection which began in Ul&s;ter. The unhappy Engli&s;h were fir&s;t plundered, and then ma&s;&s;acred without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex. Such &s;cenes of cruelty were acted by Sir Phelim Oneal and his followers, that the bare de&s;cription of them fills the mind with horror. Death and de&s;olation appeared likewi&s;e in the other provinces, and even in more mi&s;erable &s;hapes, though the rebels did not &s;o deeply imbrue their hands in blood. They &s;tripped the wretched Eng|li&s;h of their very cloaths, and drove men, women, and children naked into the fields, to peri&s;h by famine and the inclemencies of a tempe&s;tuous winter. The roads were crouded with &s;uch &s;pectacles of di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery, as one would think mu&s;t have &s;oftened the heart of the mo&s;t &s;avage barbarian. The &s;hivering, the dying, and the dead; the old and infirm, fainting with cold and hunger; the children clamorous for food and &s;helter; the mother weeping over her expiring infant; the wife &s;hrieking with terror and di&s;may; the hu&s;|band groaning with unutterable woe; formed a mo&s;t di&s;mal variety of human &s;ufferings and de&s;pair: nature, the mo&s;t barbarous and uncultivated, would have been unable to perpetrate &s;uch barbarity, had it not been exa&s;perated be|yond all feeling, by religious phrenzy. The ru&s;&s;ian bigots not only exulted in the calamity which they had produced, but even triumphed in the hope that tho&s;e wretched &s;ufferers would be damned to all eternity. In this forlorn con|dition &s;ome thou&s;ands reached the city of Dublin, where they were received with compa&s;&s;ion and treated with humanity. Many died of &s;trange di&s;tempers, occa&s;ioned by the complicated fatigues of mind and body which they had under|gone. A good number &s;unk under the weight of grief and affliction; others refu&s;ed all &s;u&s;tenance, unable to &s;urvive their families and friends. Above forty thou&s;and helple&s;s victims fell by this brutal barbarity, of which there is<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temple.</NOTE> &s;carce a parallel in the records of any age or nation. The ju&s;tices a&s;&s;embled all the troops that were not already &s;urrounded by the rebels; and the&s;e, to|gether<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carte.</NOTE> with &s;uch as enli&s;ted in the &s;ervice, amounted to &s;ix thou&s;and: but &s;ix hundred, being detached to the relief of Tredagh, be&s;ieged by the natives, were routed and put to the &s;word. The earl of Ormond, lieutenant-general, propo&s;ed to attack the in&s;urgents before they &s;hould be armed and di&s;ciplined; but the ju&s;tices, who were puritans, induced either by fear or wor&s;e motives, re&s;olved to act upon the defen&s;ive only. The Engli&s;h of the Pale (&s;uch was the appellation given to the de&s;cendants of the fir&s;t Engli&s;h &s;ettlers who &s;till profe&s;&s;ed the religion of their forefathers) expre&s;&s;ed their dete&s;tation of this rebellion, and were &s;upplied with arms to be employed in defence of the government. But they &s;oon joined the native Iri&s;h under the lord Gor|man&s;tone; &s;o that the principal army of the rebels amounted to twenty thou&s;and men, and threatened to be&s;iege Dublin. In order to allure the people to their &s;tandard, they called them&s;elves the queen's army, affirmed that their intent was to a&s;&s;ert the royal prerogative again&s;t the in&s;olence of a puri|tanical parliament; and Sir Phelim Oneal, having found a royal patent in the hou&s;e of lord Caulfield, whom he had murdered, affixed the &s;eal of it

<P>The king was no &s;ooner informed of this revolt, by a letter from the north of Ireland, than he di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger with intelligence to the par|liament of England; and demanded immediate &s;uccours from the parliament of Scotland. But, notwith&s;tanding all their profe&s;&s;ions of duty to the king, and attachment to the prote&s;tant religion, they excu&s;ed them&s;elves from taking any &s;uch mea&s;ures, alledging, that as Ireland depended upon England, the Engli&s;h parliament would undoubtedly provide for its &s;ecurity; whereas, &s;hould they intermeddle in the affair, of their own accord, they might incur the jealou&s;y of their brethren. The commons of England being informed of this di&s;a&s;ter, re|&s;olved, with the concurrence of the upper hou&s;e, to borrow fifty thou&s;and pounds of the city of London for the relief of Ireland: That the con&s;ent of the lords &s;hould be &s;olicited for depriving the lord We&s;ton of the government of the I&s;le of Wight, becau&s;e he was a reputed papi&s;t: That the principal Roman ca|tholics in England &s;hould be &s;ecured, and the queen's mona&s;tery of capuchins di&s;&s;olved. Other precautions were taken with regard to foreigners, who were not prote&s;tants. They afterwards voted, That two hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be provided for the war of Ireland: That eight thou&s;and men &s;hould be rai&s;ed and tran&s;ported to that country: That a magazine of arms and ammu|tion &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed at Che&s;ter for the u&s;e of Dublin; and, the ammu|nition at Carli&s;le be &s;ent to Carrickfergus: That the committee appointed for the affairs of Ireland &s;hould deliberate upon the means of recompen&s;ing tho&s;e who &s;hould inli&s;t as volunteers for this &s;ervice; of granting a pardon to tho&s;e of the rebels who &s;hould &s;ubmit; and of &s;etting a price on the heads of their leaders: That it &s;hould inquire in what &s;hape they could u&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Scots to the be&s;t advantage; and bring in a bill for impre&s;&s;ing &s;oldiers for the war in Ireland.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXII.</HEAD>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this appearance of ardour, and the repeated importunities of the ju&s;tices, the &s;upplies they &s;ent were &s;o incon&s;iderable, that they &s;eemed calculated to keep alive the war, rather than &s;ubdue the rebels. They had found their account in the Scotti&s;h inva&s;ion; and now they deter|mined to make advantage of the Iri&s;h rebellion, to foment the fears of the peo|ple, and keep the king in a &s;ort of dependence. Charles, with a view to di&s;|prove the calumny which the Iri&s;h had fixed upon his character, pre&s;&s;ed the par|liament, with redoubled in&s;tances, to take mea&s;ures for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the in&s;ur|gents; and this eagerne&s;s &s;upplied the commons with a pretence for &s;u&s;pecting his integrity. They affected to apprehend a de&s;ign of en&s;laving the parliament when the kingdom &s;hould be unfurni&s;hed of troops; and really dreaded his in|fluence with the army that &s;hould be rai&s;ed. He had imprudently committed to their care and wi&s;dom the conduct and pro&s;ecution of the war, that they might proceed with the more vigour in an affair of &s;uch national importance. They interpreted this expre&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t unlimited &s;en&s;e, even to the anni|hilation of the king's authority. They rai&s;ed money for the Iri&s;h war, but re|&s;erved the greate&s;t part of it for other purpo&s;es: they removed arms from the king's magazines, and employed them afterwards again&s;t his own per&s;on: they enli&s;ted men, and appointed officers, by which means they acquired great influ|ence in the army; and though a con&s;iderable time elap&s;ed before any troops were
<PB N="257" REF="2590">
&s;ent over, the fault was never imputed to them, but to the malecontents about the king's per&s;on. With a view to mortify and provoke the king, they &s;ent fre&s;h in|&s;tructions to their committee in Scotland, importing, that they had rea&s;on to be|lieve the Iri&s;h rebellion was the effect of evil coun&s;els, given by tho&s;e who con|tinued in places of tru&s;t and honour about the king. They de&s;ired his maje&s;ty to remove the&s;e evil coun&s;ellors, otherwi&s;e they &s;hould take more effectual mea|&s;ures to prevent the danger with which the kingdom was threatened. This ad|dre&s;s was a prelude to the remon&s;trance which they brought into the hou&s;e on the twenty-&s;econd day of November. It was an appeal to the people, replete with the mo&s;t virulent malignity again&s;t the king, who&s;e admini&s;tration was charged anew with every &s;hadow of a grievance which the nation had endured &s;ince the commencement of his reign; and even with every misfortune which had happened from the accidents of war, aggravated with all the force of rhe|toric and hyperbole. There was &s;till a moderate party in the hou&s;e, that op|po&s;ed this remon&s;trance with great vigour; and very warm debates ari&s;ing, the commons &s;at till three o'clock in the morning, when it was carried by a majority of nine only. After many of the moderate members had retired, quite exhau&s;ted with fatigue, it was immediately p$inted, in con&s;equence of another vote, which likewi&s;e met with &s;trong oppo&s;ition; nor did they even deign to communicate it to the upper hou&s;e.</P>

<P>On the twenty-fifth day of November, the king returning from Scotland, was received in the city of London with extraordinary demon&s;trations of joy and re&s;pect; and when he arrived at Whitehall, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the guard which the earl of E&s;&s;ex had granted for the protection of parliament. Both hou&s;es petitioned, that the guard might be continued: but, Charles ob&s;erved, there was no nece&s;&s;ity for maintaining &s;uch a guard, which &s;erved no other pur|po&s;e but that of &s;omenting the fears and &s;u&s;picions of the people. He pro|mi&s;ed, however, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, to furni&s;h them with a guard, under the command of the earl of Dor&s;et: but this they rejected. The king retiring in a few days to Hampton-Court, the commons &s;ent thither a deputation, with the remon&s;trance tacked to a petition, repre&s;enting, That the malignant party, who&s;e conduct evidently tended to the advantage and growth of popery, was guided by je&s;uits, and other emi&s;&s;aries of Rome, which had even corrupted &s;everal bi&s;hops; and found means to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the privy-council, and offices of tru&s;t about his maje&s;ty. They, for the&s;e r$a&s;ons, be&s;ought him to concur with his people in a parliamentary way, in providing for the &s;afety of the kingdom again&s;t the malicious de&s;igns of the papi&s;ts: That he would con&s;ent to their purpo&s;e of expelling the bi&s;hops from parliament; of re&s;training the power they had u&s;urped over the clergy; aboli&s;hing the innova|tions and vexations they had introduced; and of executing the good laws which had been enacted for &s;ecuring the liberty of his &s;ubjects: That he would re|move from his council tho&s;e who favoured the oppre&s;&s;ion with which the peo|ple had been afflicted; and employ in the admini&s;tration &s;uch per&s;ons only as &s;hould be agreeable to the parliament, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ollicitation of any per&s;on whatever. Tho' the king could not but be &s;hocked at this petition and remon&s;trance, which were in effect manife&s;tos again&s;t him, printed and pub|li&s;hed contrary to his expre&s;s de&s;ire; he made a very moderate, though general an&s;wer to the fir&s;t; and in the &s;equel publi&s;hed a declaration in an&s;wer to the
<PB N="258" REF="2600">
remon&s;trance: but, his cr$dit was by this time reduced &s;o low with the na|tion, that $t produced very little effect in his favour. In the beginning of Decem|ber, the king going to the hou&s;e o$ lords to pa&s;s the act of tonnage and poun|dage $or a few months only, gave both hou&s;es to under&s;tand, That far from repenting his having pa&s;&s;$d the bills which had been pre&s;ented d$ring this &s;e&s;|&s;ion, he would repeat the &s;ame conduct on the $ame occa&s;ion; and grant every thing that could be rea&s;onably demanded for the maintenance of the liberties and religion of his &s;ubjects. He recommended di&s;pa$ch in the relief of Ireland; and de&s;ired they would appoint commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the two Scotti&s;h no|blemen deputed by the parliament of that kingdom, to receive their propo&s;als touching the &s;uccours to be &s;ent from thence to Ireland. A committee was immed$ately appointed for this purpo&s;e. The Iri&s;h rebels, having in a memo|r$al to the ju&s;tices, demanded liberty of con&s;cience, the $ommons of England de$ired a conference with the lords; and both hou&s;$s &s;olemnly declared, that $hey would never con&s;ent to a toleration of the Roman religion in Ireland.</P>

<P>The king and the puritan party &s;eemed equally &s;u&s;picious, and afraid of each other. The commons intended to employ ten thou&s;and Scots in the reduction o$ Ireland, that England might not be left unprovided. The king de&s;ired to &s;end over an equal number of Engli&s;h and Scots, and the lords e$pou$ed his opinion. The commons declared. That unle$s the bill for pre&s;|&s;ing &s;ho$ld pa&s;s, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to levy troops in England for the &s;er|vice. They had already impri&s;oned lord Dillo$, and lord Taaffe, &s;ent to the king by the lord ju$tices of Ireland, with propo&s;itions from the rebel$; and they $$ized their papers, among which they hoped to find &s;omething to the pre$u|d$ce of their &s;overeign. They petitioned the king to declare the Iri&s;h, reb$ls $nd traitors; and he publi&s;hed a proclamation for this purpo&s;e: but, by the &s;ecretary's order, the printer was forbid to ca&s;t off a greater number than fi$ty copies. The king having received notice of an intended tum$lt at We&s;tmin|$ter, ordered the &s;heriff to place a guard upon the parliament, which was im|mediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the hou&s;e of commons. The king being informed of their having brought in a bill for pre&s;&s;ing &s;oldiers, in which there was a clau&s;e $ontrary to his prerogative of levying troops; and that this bill had been already &s;ent to the lords, he re&s;olved to prevent its being enacted into a law without &s;ome qualification. He convened both hou&s;es, and told them, he was content to pa&s;s the bill, provided they would in&s;ert this clau&s;e, <Q>&startq;Saving the rights of king and people.&endq;</Q> A committee for both hou&s;es was immediately appointed, to take this propo&s;al into con$ideration; and, upon their report, the lords and commons voted, That the king had violated the privileges of parliament, in propo&s;ing a limitation to a bill before it was pre&s;ented; in taking cognizance of a bill while it was in agitation; and, in expre&s;&s;ing re&s;entment again&s;t him or t$em, who had made any motion about the bill while it was in debate.</P>

<P>They publi&s;hed a declaration, and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s upon the $ame &s;$bject; to which $e an&s;wered in writing, that nothing was $arther from his intention than any thought of violating their privileges. He gave them further cau&s;e of offence, in taking the lieutenancy of the Tower from Sir Wil|$$am Bal$our, who was their creature; and be&s;towing it upon colonel Lunsford, a man of an enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, and a very indifferent character. The Londoners
<PB N="259" REF="2610">
immediately pre&s;ented a petition again&s;t this officer, as a man of bad morals, repre&s;enting the importance of &s;uch a tru&s;t, and intreating the commons to take the affair into their con&s;ideration. The lower hou&s;e de&s;ired the concurrence of the lords, in petitioning his maje&s;ty to appoint Sir John Conyers lieutenant of the Tower; but the peers refu&s;ed to concur with a demand which was &s;o ma|nife&s;tly contrary to the royal prerogative. The commons, incen&s;ed at this re|pul&s;e, voted, that Lunsford was not a proper per&s;on for this office: they pub|li&s;hed a declaration, &s;pecifying the cau&s;es of their fear and di&s;tru&s;t; expatiating upon the continual ob&s;tacles they encountered in the upper hou&s;e, which was filled with bi&s;hops and popi&s;h lords; and prote&s;ting again&s;t all the mi&s;chiefs that would happen, &s;hould the command of the Tower remain in the hands of Lunsford: at the &s;ame time, they de&s;ired the earl of Newport to re&s;ide in the place of which he was con&s;table. The apprentices a&s;&s;embling in great numbers, pre&s;ented a petition to the king again&s;t papi&s;ts, innovators, and bi|&s;hops; and the whole city was filled with tumult. Then Charles deprived Lunsford of his office; but, at the &s;ame time, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the earl of Newport from his government, becau&s;e he had been told, that during his ab&s;ence in Scotland, the earl, at an a&s;&s;embly in Ken&s;ington, where mention was made of a con&s;piracy in that kingdom, &s;aid, <Q>&startq;If there is really &s;uch a con&s;piracy, we have his wife and children in our power.&endq;</Q> The earl, however, denied that he had ever u&s;ed &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>The leaders of the oppo&s;ition, as a previous &s;tep to the exclu&s;ion of the bi&s;hops, thought proper to excite popular clamours again&s;t them, and employed their emi&s;&s;aries to rai&s;e tumults. A great multitude of the popu|lace a&s;&s;embling at We&s;tmin&s;ter, exclaimed, "No bi&s;hops, no bi&s;hops," and in|&s;ulted &s;ome prelates going to parliament. Captain Hyde, with &s;ome other di&s;banded officers being pre&s;ent, drew his &s;word, and propo&s;ed to cha&s;ti&s;e tho&s;e round-heads: but, being un&s;upported, he was apprehended and carried before the commons, who committed him to pri&s;on. Hence aro&s;e the appella|tion of Round-heads, &s;ugge&s;ted by the cropped hair worn by the apprentices; who, in their turn, reproached their antagoni&s;ts with the name of Cavaliers. In a few hours after this adventure, Lunsford and &s;ome other officers fell upon the multitude with their &s;words, and wounded above twenty apprentices. An infinite number of the populace immediately crowded to We&s;tmin&s;ter, armed with &s;words and &s;taves; and the two cities were filled with uproar and confu|&s;ion. The mayor of London ordered the gates to be &s;hut: the king &s;ent for the trained bands to Whitehall. The lords, by their u&s;her, commanded the people to retire; and the mob refu&s;ing to obey the order, demanded the con|currence of the commons, in publi&s;hing a declaration again&s;t tumults, and de|&s;iring a guard of his maje&s;ty. The lower hou&s;e pretended it was too late to deliberate upon &s;uch a propo&s;al: in the mean time, they impowered a commit|tee to &s;et at liberty &s;uch of the rioters as were impri&s;oned. The tumults con|tinuing next day, they took no &s;tep to di&s;per&s;e the people; and Mr. Pym being exhorted to u&s;e his influence for this purpo&s;e, is &s;aid to have replied, <Q>&startq;God forbid that the people &s;hould be hindered from obtaining their ju&s;t de&s;ires.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>Twelve prelates meeting at the hou&s;e of the archbi&s;hop of York, &s;ub&s;cribed a prote&s;t, which was pre&s;ented to the king and lords, im|porting,
<PB N="260" REF="2620">
That as they had an inconte&s;tible right to vote in parliament, they were ready to do their duty, if not prevented by force and violence: That they ab|$$$rred all opinions tending to the advancement of popery: That, as they had been in&s;ulted, and their lives endangered by the fury of the populace, they could no longer repair to the hou&s;e of peers, unle&s;s mea&s;ures &s;hould be taken for their per&s;onal &s;afety: and, therefore they prote&s;ted again&s;t all laws, votes, and re&s;o|lutions, that &s;hould be made in their ab&s;ence. The lords no &s;ooner received this prote&s;t, which was, in effect, an effort to di&s;&s;olve or &s;u&s;pend the parliament; than they demanded a conference with the commons, who having taken it into con&s;ideration, re&s;olved to accu&s;e the bi&s;hops of high trea&s;on, for having at|tempted to &s;ubvert the fundamental laws, and the very e&s;&s;ence of parliaments. This re&s;olution was immediately executed; and the twelve bi&s;hops were com|mited to pri&s;on. Next day the commons &s;ent a deputation to the king, de&s;iring he would appoint a guard for their &s;ecurity, under the command of E&s;&s;ex, in whom they could confide; and the king demanding a me&s;&s;age to this effect in writing, they, in the mean time, provided them&s;elves with a number of hal|$ards in their own defence. They were apprehen&s;ive of Lunsford and his confederates, as well as of the &s;tudents of the inns of court, who had appeared in abody at Whitehall, and offered their &s;ervice to his maje&s;ty, from whom they met with a very gracious reception. He dreaded the con&s;equence of &s;uch tumultuous a&s;&s;emblies of the populace; he &s;ent orders to the common-council to take mea&s;ures for preventing tho&s;e di&s;orderly meetings; and in an&s;wer to the me&s;&s;age of the commons, he &s;aid, he &s;aw no foundation for their fears; that he would protect them with the &s;ame care he &s;hould exert in defence of his own wife and children; or &s;hould this a&s;&s;urance prove in&s;ufficient, he would appoint a guard, for which he him&s;elf would be re&s;pon&s;ible.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ch. 1642.</NOTE> The mutual &s;u&s;picion and di&s;tru&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the king and parliament, had now proceeded &s;o far, that both &s;ides fore&s;aw a rupture; and each endeavoured to find a pretext from the other's conduct. At this critical conjuncture, the king took the mo&s;t imprudent &s;tep that ever was devi&s;ed by a weak and ra&s;h mini&s;ter. The lord Digby per&s;uaded him to impeach the mo&s;t popular men in parliament, of high trea&s;on. On the third day of January, the attorney-general going to the hou&s;e of peers, gave them to under&s;tand the king had commanded him to accu&s;e the lord Kimbolton, Denzil Hollis, Arthur Ha&s;lerig, John Pym, John Hambden, and William Strode, of high trea&s;on: at the &s;ame time, he delivered the general articles of the charge, which he had re|ceived from his maje&s;ty's own hand. They were taxed with having endeavoured to &s;ubvert the government, &s;trip the king of his prerogative, and ve&s;t the &s;ub|jects with an arbitrary power over the lives, effects, and liberties of the people: with having calumniated the king, in order to render him odious to his people: with having attempted to per&s;uade the late army to di&s;obey the king's orders, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in executing their trea&s;onable de&s;igns: with having traiterou&s;ly incited and invited a foreign power to invade England: with having e&s;&s;ayed to &s;ubvert the foundation and e&s;&s;ence of parliaments: and, with having employed force and terror, and encouraged tumults again&s;t the king and parliament. The attorney added, it was the king's de&s;ire, that a committee &s;hould be appointed to examine witne&s;&s;es, under an oath of &s;ecrecy; and, that the lords would &s;ecure
<PB N="261" REF="2630">
the per&s;ons of the accu&s;ed. The peers immediately nominated a committee to examine the regularity of the&s;e proceedings, and to &s;earch the regi$ters, that they might know, whether or not a peer of the realm had, ever before this pe|riod, been impeached at the bar of the lords by the king's attorney-general: at the &s;ame time, they tran&s;mitted the accu&s;ation of the five members of the lower hou&s;e, to the commons, who having received notice that the king's officers had &s;ealed up the cabinets of tho&s;e accu&s;ed members, &s;ent their &s;erjeant to take off the &s;eals, and impri&s;on tho&s;e who had applied them. An order was likewi&s;e made, that in ca&s;e the &s;ame violence &s;hould be offered to any other member, h$ might require the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the con&s;table, to apprehend and detain the officer &s;o acting.</P>

<P>In a conference with the upper hou&s;e, they expatiated upon this in|&s;ult; and as the king had a &s;trong guard at Whitehall, propo&s;ed, that the par|liament &s;hould take the &s;ame precaution, or adjourn to &s;ome place of &s;afety. During their deliberations on this &s;ubject, a $erjeant at arms repaired to the lower hou&s;e; and in the king's name, demanded, that the accu&s;ed members &s;hould be delivered into his hands. The commons &s;ent a deputation to the king, repre&s;enting, that they would take his me&s;&s;age into con&s;ideration; and, th$t in the mean time, the five accu&s;ed members &s;hould be ready to an&s;wer any charge, according to law. They were accordingly ordered to attend every day in the hou&s;e. The king deferred his an&s;wer till next morning, but declared that the &s;erjeant had acted in obedience to his command. The commons being a&s;|&s;$mbled next day, were informed that the king approached with his band of pen&s;ioners, and a great number of armed attendants. The five members im|mediately withdrew; and they had &s;carce quitted the hou&s;e, when the king en|tering, walked up to the &s;peaker's chair, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;By your leave, Mr. &s;peaker, I mu&s;t make u&s;e of your chair for a moment.&endq;</Q> Having &s;eated him&s;elf, and looked around, he told the hou&s;e he was &s;orry for the occa&s;ion that forced him thither: that he was come in per&s;on to &s;eize the members whom he had accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on, &s;eeing they would not deliver them to his &s;erjeant at arms. Addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the &s;peaker, he de&s;ired to know, whether any of them were in the hou&s;e. The &s;peaker falling on his knees, replied, That he had nei|ther<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth. Nal&s;on. Whitelock.</NOTE> eyes to &s;ee, nor tongue to &s;peak in that place, but as the hou&s;e was plea&s;ed to direct him; and he begged his maje&s;ty's pardon, that he could give no other an&s;wer. The king carefully &s;urveying the hou&s;e, &s;aid the birds were flown; but he expected they would &s;ecure, and deliver them into his hands. He de|$lared his intention was, to try them in a fair and legal manner; and maintain whatever had been done in favour of the &s;ubject. When he retired, a great number of members cried aloud, "Privilege, privilege!" &s;o that he heard the exclamation. Then the hou&s;e was adjourned till next day, when they voted, That the king had violated their privileges: and, That they could not a&s;&s;em|ble again in the &s;ame place, until they &s;hould have obtained &s;atisfaction, and a guard for their &s;ecurity. They appointed a committee of four and twenty mem|bers, to &s;it in Guildhall, and deliberate upon the &s;teps that &s;hould be taken for &s;ecuring the kingdom, and maintaining the privileges of parliament. Then they informed the lords of the tran&s;action of the preceding day; and adjourned from the fifth to the eleventh day of January.</P>

<P>The king having ordered the mayor of London to a&s;&s;emble the common-council in Guildhall, went thither, and in pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treets had the mortification to hear the people exclaim, "Privilege, privilege." Nay, a paper was thrown into his coach, in&s;cribed with the&s;e words, <Q>&startq;To your tents, O I&s;rael.&endq;</Q> He told the common-council, that he was come to demand the per&s;ons accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on, who, he under&s;tood, were concealed in the city. He demanded their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in apprehending the delinquents, that they might be tried according to law; and he declared, upon his royal word, that his inten|tion was to defend the prote&s;tant religion to the la&s;t day of his life, again&s;t all its enemies. This declaration had very little weight with the citizens, who were ge|nerally of the puritan faction; and had &s;everely &s;marted under his admini&s;tration. In&s;tead of complying with his de&s;ire, the common-council pre&s;ented a petition, repre&s;enting the decay of trade, and the terrors of the citizens, occa&s;ioned by the progre&s;s of the rebellion in Ireland, fomented by the papi&s;ts of England: they complained of the delay of &s;uccours de&s;tined for Ireland; of a plot again&s;t the prote&s;tant religion; the change of lieutenant of the Tower; the extraordinary armaments at Whitehall; endeavours to gain over the &s;tudents of the law; the mi&s;under&s;tanding between king and parliament; and, his maje&s;ty's entering the hou&s;e of commons to &s;eize &s;ome of the members, contrary to the privileges of parliament. Charles, in his an&s;wer, made a particular reply to all the&s;e articles; and concluded with a profe&s;&s;ion of particular e&s;teem for the city of London. He next day publi&s;hed a proclamation, commanding all magi&s;trates and officers of ju&s;tice, to apprehend the accu&s;ed members, and convey them to the Tower; but no regard was payed to his profe&s;&s;ions or commands. The committee of four and twenty came to the following re&s;olutions: That the publication of the articles charged again&s;t the accu&s;ed members, was a manife&s;t violation of the pri|vileges of parliament, and a &s;editious act, tending to the interruption of the public peace: That the &s;aid privileges could not be properly maintained, unle&s;s his ma|je&s;ty &s;hould plea&s;e to name tho&s;e who had advi&s;ed him to &s;eal the clo&s;ets and cabinets of the accu&s;ed members; to &s;end a &s;erjeant at arms, with orders to arre&s;t them in the hou&s;e of commons; to go thither him&s;elf; and to publi&s;h the charge in the form of a proclamation; to the end that tho&s;e pernicious coun&s;ellors might be brought to condign puni&s;hment.</P>

<P>The king, afraid of expo&s;ing him&s;elf to &s;ome in&s;ult from &s;uch a tumultuous populace, retired to Wind&s;or; and the hou&s;e of commons meeting on the eleventh day of January at We&s;tmin&s;ter, the committee went thither by water, attended by a great number of watermen, who undertook to guard them from violence. Charles, in order to atone for the wrong &s;tep he had taken, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the two hou&s;es, giving them to under&s;tand, that he de&s;i&s;ted from his pro&s;ecution of the lord Kimbolton, and the five members: that his in|tention was to proceed again&s;t them in a more unexceptionable manner: and, that he would take as much care of the privileges of parliament as of his own crown and life. He afterwards repeated the &s;ame a&s;&s;urances in a &s;econd me&s;&s;age; and intreated them to deliberate upon the &s;ituation of Ireland, as an intere&s;ting &s;ubject that required vigour and di&s;patch. Far from being &s;atisfied with the&s;e in&s;tances of conde&s;cen&s;ion, they confirmed the re&s;olution of their committee, in the form of a declaration. They impeached the attorney-general
<PB N="263" REF="2650">
for having violated their privileges, in pre&s;enting articles again&s;t their members to the upper hou&s;e, although he acted by his maje&s;ty's expre&s;s command; and the two hou&s;es petitioned the king to communicate the proofs he could produce again&s;t the &s;ix members. The king left it to their choice, whether he &s;hould proceed again&s;t them before the parliament, or according to common law. They rejected the alternative, and in&s;i&s;ted upon their former demand. Then Charles, in a third me&s;&s;age, de&s;i&s;ted intirely from the pur&s;uit; and as a proof of his af|fection for his &s;ubjects, offered to grant a general pardon in &s;uch manner as &s;hould be agreeable to the parliament. Even this conce&s;&s;ion produced no effect in his favour. They, in another petition, demanded that he would be plea&s;ed to deliver up to ju&s;tice tho&s;e evil coun&s;ellors by whom he had been mi&s;led; and the lords pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence again&s;t Sir Edward Herbert, the attorney-general, de|claring him incapable of exerci&s;ing any other employment than that which he at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> pre&s;ent enjoyed; and committing him to cu&s;tody during the plea&s;ure of the hou&s;e.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nal&s;on.</NOTE> The mutual di&s;tru&s;t of the king and parliament daily increa&s;ed. Sir John Biron, lieutenant of the Tower, was &s;ummoned to appear at the bar of the hou&s;e of commons, to explain the rea&s;ons that induced him to &s;end arms and ammunition to Whitehall, at the time when the king entered the lower hou&s;e; but he excu&s;ed him&s;elf from obeying their citation, as he had his maje&s;ty's ex|pre&s;s command to keep within his garri&s;on. The commons rejected the king's offer of furni&s;hing them with a guard commanded by the earl of Lind&s;ey, and ordered major-general Skippon to attend them every day with two companies of the London militia. Hearing that lord Digby had a&s;&s;embled about two hun|dred officers on hor&s;eback at King&s;ton upon Thames, h$ &s;ent orders to the &s;he|riffs of the neighbouring counties to rai&s;e their po&s;&s;es, and attack tho&s;e who &s;hould attempt to invade the peace of the kingdom: and they cautioned colonel Goring, governor of Port&s;mouth, again&s;t delivering up the place to any per&s;on, or admitting any troops, but in con&s;equence of the king's order, notified by both hou&s;es of parliament. They circulated a report that the king had formed the de&s;ign of &s;urpri&s;ing Port&s;mouth; and even examined &s;ome evidences on the &s;ubject. The lords &s;ent an expre&s;s order to lord Digby, to return and re&s;ume his &s;eat in parliament; but knowing him&s;elf obnoxious to both hou&s;es, as the king's chief coun&s;ellor and confident, he prudently withdrew him&s;elf from the kingdom.</P>

<P>The lords and commons concurred in appointing Sir John Ho|tham governor of Hull, where there was a magazine of arms, which the king had purcha&s;ed for the Scotti&s;h war. Hotham received an order from the par|liament, of which he was a member, forbidding him to deliver the place to any per&s;on what&s;oever, but &s;uch as &s;hould be commi&s;&s;ioned by the king and both hou&s;es of parliament. They brought in a bill for adjourning them&s;elves to &s;ome other place of &s;afety, as though they believed them&s;elves in danger at We&s;tmin|&s;ter. They forbade the earl of Newport, ma&s;ter of theordnance, and the lieute|nant of the Tower, to part with any cannon or warlike &s;tores: they ordered the &s;heriffs of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter to keep a con&s;tant guard for blocking up the Tower. They &s;eized &s;ome &s;addles de&s;igned for King&s;ton; and in con&s;e|quence of fal&s;e information given by Bag&s;haw, one of their own members, they directed Skippon, whom they had rai&s;ed to the dignity of a major-general, to detach a party of hor&s;emen to Wind&s;or for intelligence. The earls of E&s;&s;ex and
<PB N="2$4" REF="2660">
Holland, being ordered to give attendance on the king, as lord chamberlain and groom of the &s;tole, the lords forbade them to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from parlia|ment, where their pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ervice of the public. Such acts of u&s;urpation were manife&s;t proofs of their having already annihilated the king's authority.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Ireland re|mained in a mo&s;t forlorn &s;ituation. Charles offered to levy ten thou&s;and men for that &s;ervice; but the parliament in&s;i&s;ted upon an act for pre&s;&s;ing &s;oldiers, that they might have it in their power to extend their influence, by granting commi&s;&s;ions to their own adherents. A bill for this purpo&s;e had been &s;ent up to the lords, but had not yet pa&s;&s;ed the upper hou&s;e. Mean while, the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners offered their mediation to compromi&s;e the differences between the king and parliament; but as they had not previou&s;ly communicated their intention to his maje&s;ty, he rejected their offer as an in&s;ult; while the two hou&s;es thanked them for this mark of their affection. Neverthele&s;s, he a&s;&s;ented to a propo&s;al of the Iri&s;h committee, that two thou&s;and five hundred Scotti&s;h troops already levied, &s;hould be forthwith tran&s;ported to the north of Ireland, and be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Carrickfergus for their head-quarters.</P>

<P>The commons &s;till continued to court popularity, and alarm the nation with imaginary terrors. The accu&s;ed members had been brought to the hou&s;e in triumph, attended by a cavalcade of the citizens. Petitions were de|livered by the apprentices, porters, and even by a multitude of women, headed by a brewer's wife, who compared her&s;elf to the woman of Tekoah; and claimed a right equal to that of men, in communicating their &s;en&s;e of the public dan|ger, becau&s;e Chri&s;t had died for them as well as for the other &s;ex. Addre&s;&s;es of the &s;ame nature were pre&s;ented by the inhabitants of Buckingham&s;hire, Hert|ford&s;hire, and E&s;&s;ex, complaining of the decay of trade, the growth of popery, and the malignant party by which the king was mi&s;led; petitioning, that the evil coun&s;ellors might be removed from his maje&s;ty: that the kingdom &s;hould be put in a po&s;ture of defence by order of the two hou&s;es: that the bi&s;hops &s;hould<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$$$wo$th. $$arendon.</NOTE> be deprived of their votes and &s;eats in parliament: and prote&s;ting they would hazard their lives and fortunes in forwarding the good work. All the&s;e peti|tioners were thanked and care&s;&s;ed by Pym and his a&s;&s;ociates, while tho&s;e who addre&s;&s;ed them, in favour of the church and monarchy, were di&s;couraged, impri|&s;oned, and pro&s;ecuted as delinquents. The committee for the affairs of Ireland, having demanded of the city of London, one hundred thou&s;and pounds by way of loan, for the relief of that kingdom, the mayor and aldermen pre|&s;ented a petition to the commons, declaring their incapacity to levy any &s;um by way of impo&s;ition, without the con&s;ent of the lenders, which could not be ob|tained, becau&s;e the money formerly borrowed of them was not yet repayed, nor applied to the relief of Ireland, for which it had been demanded. They &s;aid the citizens were di&s;couraged by the king's refu&s;ing to employ thirteen thou&s;and Scots for that &s;ervice; by the delay in pa&s;&s;ing the bill for pre&s;&s;ing &s;oldiers; in di&s;|arming the papi&s;ts; in putting the kingdom in a po&s;ture of defence; in appoint|ing a lieutenant of the Tower, in whom the nation could con&s;ide. They com|plained that the king's &s;hips were employed in tran&s;porting delinquents out of the kingdom: that many thou&s;ands of p$ople unknown$ concealed them|&s;elves about Covent-Garden for &s;ome $ini$t$r purpo&s;e: that, by the mi&s;under|&s;tanding

<P>In a conference between the two hou&s;es, the&s;e petitions were communicated to the lords by Mr. Pym, who took this occa&s;ion to pronounce an acrimonious &s;peech, expatiating upon the groans, the agony, the terror, the perplexity of the nation, the variety of dangers to which the kingdom was expo&s;ed, the calamities from which the&s;e dangers proceeded; and the multi|plicity of influences that con&s;tituted the &s;ource of the&s;e calamities. He pre|tended that the kingdom was in danger from the de&s;igns of foreign princes, already armed to take advantage of its inte&s;tine divi&s;ions; from the multitude of papi&s;ts at home; from the in&s;urrection of the common people; and from the rebellion in Ireland. He imputed the&s;e dangers to ob&s;tructions in the re|formation of the church; to the power of the bi&s;hops, and the corruption of the clergy; to the interruption of commerce, which could not be charged upon the commons; and to the delay of &s;uccouring the prote&s;tants in Ireland, in who&s;e behalf they had exerted their utmo&s;t endeavours. He &s;aid, that &s;ome of tho&s;e who were now at the head of the rebellion, had obtained pa&s;&s;ports from his maje&s;ty: that the commons had been intimidated in the pro&s;ecution of de|linquents; and the king's ve&s;&s;els employed in conveying to another country, tho&s;e who fled from the ju&s;tice of parliament: that the kingdom was expo&s;ed to inva&s;ion and in&s;urrection, by the decayed condition of the fleet and fortifi|cations, as well as by the want of a proper power to regulate the militia: that the deliberations of parliament had been interrupted by violent con&s;piracies, violation of privileges, and repeated efforts to &s;ow the &s;eeds of divi&s;ion between the two hou&s;es: that all the&s;e mi&s;chiefs originally &s;prung from the pernicious coun&s;ellors that mi&s;led his maje&s;ty: It was this malign influence that engendered the war with Scotland, the rebellion in Ireland, the corruption of religion, the lo&s;s of national liberty, and the horrible attempts which had been made to de&s;troy the very e&s;&s;ence of parliaments. He harangued upon the in|nocence and virtue of the commons, which had been &s;o ba&s;ely calumniated by the malignant party; and he conjured the lords to concur vigorou&s;ly with the commons in their endeavours to &s;ave the nation. The &s;en&s;ible reader will per|ceive, that the fears of inva&s;ion were chimerical; and that the kingdom was threatened with no danger, but from that national di&s;traction which they them|&s;elves fomented. Pym was &s;olemnly thanked by the &s;peaker, in the name of the commons, for his excellent &s;peech, which was ordered to be printed and publi&s;hed. The king finding him&s;elf accu&s;ed of having granted pa&s;&s;ports to the rebels, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e, demanding reparation for &s;uch malicious ca|lumny. The hou&s;e vindicated Pym, and named &s;everal per&s;ons who had ob|tained pa&s;&s;ports for Ireland: the king affirmed that they had been granted while he was in Scotland, and before he knew of their order for &s;hutting up<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> the ports of the kingdom. The hou&s;e replied by a declaration, in which they

maintained the truth of Pym's a&s;&s;ertion, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to grant that &s;atisfaction which the king demanded.</P>

<P>Charles, who had every thing to apprehend from the malevo|lence of &s;uch a faction, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to both hou&s;es, propo&s;ing that they &s;hould &s;peedily and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ary means for maintaining the royal authority, &s;ettling the king's revenues, &s;ecuring the privileges of parlia|ment$ the liberty and property of the &s;ubject, the &s;afety of the prote&s;tant religion as profe&s;&s;ed in England; and for regulating the ceremonies of divine wor&s;hip in &s;uch a manner that they &s;hould not for the future give any ju&s;t cau&s;e of of|fence. All the&s;e particulars being dige&s;ted and reduced into one body, he and the parliament would be better able to judge of them. He &s;aid, that, by his conce&s;&s;ions, it would appear how far he had always been from forming any of tho&s;e de&s;igns which the fears and jealou&s;ies of &s;ome per&s;ons had &s;ugge&s;ted; and how ready he would be to exceed the greate&s;t examples of the mo&s;t indulgent princes, in their acts of grace and favour towards their &s;ubjects. The commons thanked him for his goodne&s;s, promi&s;ing to labour &s;eriou&s;ly in that which he had pro|po&s;ed; and they told him they had de&s;ired the concurrence of the lords, in be&s;eeching his maje&s;ty to put the militia, the Tower of London, and all the other &s;trengths of the kingdom, in the hands of tho&s;e who &s;hould be recommended to him by the two hou&s;es. To this addre&s;s the king replied, that if Sir John Byron &s;hould be found unworthy of retaining the lieu|tenancy of the Tower, he would deprive him of that office; otherwi&s;e he could not allow his &s;ervants to be expo&s;ed to &s;uch unde&s;erved affronts: that he would never confer that po&s;t upon any per&s;on whom the parliament &s;hould have room to di&s;tru&s;t; but that he would re&s;erve to him&s;elf the nomination, as a jewel in|&s;eparable from his crown, and a right with which he was inve&s;ted by the fun|damental laws of the kingdom: with re&s;pect to the militia, which ought to de|pend upon his authority alone, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be regulated for the &s;afety of the kingdom; and, as &s;oon as the two hou&s;es &s;hould have di|ge&s;ted a &s;cheme for that purpo&s;e, he would &s;ignify his &s;entiments in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould be agreeable to his own honour and the &s;ecurity of his people. At the &s;ame time he exhibited an undeniable proof of his de&s;ire to oblige them, by depriving Sir John Byron of the lieutenancy, and conferring it upon Sir John Conyers, whom the commons had recommended for that office.</P>

<P>Neverthele&s;s, the two hou&s;es pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, be&s;eeching him to commit the Tower of London, the other &s;trong places, and the militia of the kingdom, to &s;uch per&s;ons as they &s;hould propo&s;e: and he de&s;ired them to make out a li&s;t of tho&s;e whom they approved as commanders of &s;trong holds and the militia, a&s;&s;uring them that he would employ &s;uch as they &s;hould recommend, provided he &s;hould have no ju&s;t cau&s;e of exception. The par|liament immediately prepared an ordinance for the regulation of the militia, to which they fixed a li&s;t of the names they recommended for the lieutenants of the counties, and delivered them with a petition, demanding his maje&s;ty's a&s;&s;ent. Charles, finding their demands increa&s;ed in proportion to his conde|&s;cen&s;ion, fore&s;aw that the conte&s;t would end in a civil war; and thought it high time to provide for his own &s;afety and that of his family. He &s;ent the

queen to Holland, on pretence of her accompanying the prince&s;s Mary to the prince of Orange her hu&s;band; and, being de&s;titute of money, he furni&s;hed her with &s;ome of the crown-jewels, to be &s;old in ca&s;e of emergency. He had, by means of the earl of Newca&s;tle, endeavoured to &s;ecure the magazine of Hull before Hotham was &s;ent to command that place, and he now &s;ecretly tampered with Go$ing, governor of Port&s;mouth. Nor will any unprejudiced per&s;on blame him for taking the&s;e precautions again&s;t the de&s;igns of a powerful faction that &s;eemed bent upon his ruin, by which alone the chiefs of it thought they could be &s;ecured from the vengeance of injured royalty. He &s;aw him&s;elf fallen from the highe&s;t pinnacle of envied monarchy to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t abject dependence; deprived of his prerogative and every enjoy|ment for which a king could wi&s;h to inherit the throne of his ance&s;tors; rob|bed of his honour and reputation, and defrauded of his people's love by the vile&s;t arts of calumny and malice; expo&s;ed to every &s;pecies of in&s;ult and mor|tification; bereft of his friends, de&s;erted by his coun&s;ellors; obliged to &s;acrifice his be&s;t mini&s;ters to cruel, unrelenting party-rage; and to part (perhaps) for ever with tho&s;e who were mo&s;t dear to his affection. He &s;aw the regal power already trampled under foot, the civil con&s;titution altered and impaired; and the hierarchy, to which he was con&s;cientiou&s;ly attached, in the mo&s;t imminent danger of being overturned by fanatici&s;m and religious phrenzy.</P>

<P>When the ordinance was pre&s;ented, he told them, that being upon the road to Dover with the queen and prince&s;s, he could not give an an|&s;wer to an affair of &s;uch importance till after his return. The two hou&s;es im|portuned him in another petition; and he &s;ent his an&s;wer, importing, that he was willing to appoint commanders for the militia according to their recom|mendation, except in the city of London, and other corporations, which by their charters were ve&s;ted with the power of commanding their own militia: but that he could not &s;trip him&s;elf for an indefinite time of that power ve&s;ted in him by the laws of God and man for the defence of his people; he de&s;ired therefore that this affair &s;hould be &s;ettled by act of parliament, for the &s;atis|faction of all his &s;ubjects. The hou&s;es voted that this an&s;wer was not &s;atis|factory; and drew up a third petition, which was delivered to him at Theo|balds, whither he had retired. They repeated the old &s;train of jealou&s;ies, fears, dangers, and pernicious coun&s;ellors. They declared, that in ca&s;e he &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in his refu&s;al, they would pa&s;s the ordinance by the authority of the two hou&s;es. They intreated him to re&s;ide in &s;ome place near London; to give order that his royal highne&s;s &s;hould fix his habitation in St. James's palace; and they begged leave to inform him, that the power of regulating the militia could not be granted to any community or corporation without the authority of the parliament. <Q>&startq;You &s;peak of jealou&s;ies and fears: (&s;aid the king in his an&s;wer) lay your hands to your hearts, and a&s;k your&s;elves, whether I may not likewi&s;e be di&s;turbed with fears and jealou&s;ies?&endq;</Q> He &s;aid, his an&s;wer, touching the militia, was &s;o agreeable to ju&s;tice and rea&s;on, that he &s;hould not alter it in any point: that he wi&s;hed it might be &s;afe and honourable for him to re&s;ide near the parliament: that he would take care of his &s;on in &s;uch a man|ner, as &s;hould ju&s;tify him to God as a father, and to his dominions as a king: he a&s;&s;ured them, upon his honour, that he had no thoughts but of peace and

<P>The commons, in $word$ of this an&s;wer, immediately voted it a refu$al to grant the demands of the two hou&s;es touching the militia: they re|&s;olved$ That the denial was &s;ugge&s;ted by the enemies of the &s;tate, and would hazard the peace and &s;afety of the kingdom: That his maje&s;ty's removal to any remote part would endanger the kingdom and prejudice the proceedings of pa$liament: That an examination &s;hould be &s;et on foot to find out and bring to condign puni&s;hment the authors of &s;uch pernicious advice: That the lords &s;hould be moved to concur with the commons in the&s;e votes, and to appoint a &s;elect committee that &s;hould join another of the commons to deliberate upon the mea&s;ures to be taken in &s;uch an emergency. Then the two hou&s;es publi&s;hed their ordinance for e&s;tabli&s;hing the militia under the command of per&s;ons nomi|nated for that purpo&s;e in counties and corporations. On the ninth day of March, the king, being at Newmarket, was pre&s;ented with a declaration from both hou&s;es, explaining the cau&s;es of their fears and &s;u&s;picions, which they a&s;cribed to a pretended plot again&s;t the religion and peace of the kingdom, formed by evil coun&s;ellors by whom his maje&s;ty had been mi&s;led. They im|puted the rebellion in Ireland to the machinations of Engli&s;h papi&s;ts counte|nanced by the government. They particulari&s;ed all the in&s;tances of vi|olation of privileges, which they had undergone; and among the&s;e enu|merated, the king's &s;aying he wi&s;hed it might be &s;afe and honourable for him to re&s;ide near the parliament. They be&s;ought him to remove from his pre&s;ence tho&s;e evil coun&s;ellors who were the authors of all the dangers and troubles to which the nation was expo&s;ed; and to re&s;ide with the prince in the neighbour|hood of London. The king, being thus hara&s;&s;ed out of all patience, told the committee, that he would take time to an&s;wer this &s;trange and unexpected de|claration. He &s;aid, God in his good time will di&s;cover the bottoms of all plots and trea&s;ons, and then he &s;hould &s;tand right in the eyes of his people. <Q>&startq;I &s;till confe&s;s my fears (added he) and call God to witne&s;s, that they are greater for the true prote&s;tant profe&s;&s;ion, my people, and laws, than for my own rights and &s;afety; though I mu&s;t tell you I conceive that none of the&s;e are free from danger. God &s;o deal with me and mine, as all my thoughts and intentions are upright for the maintenance of the true prote&s;|tant profe&s;&s;ion, and for the ob&s;ervation and pre&s;ervation of the laws of this land.&endq;</Q> Charles could not hear the declaration read without manife&s;t marks of emotion. He interrupted it &s;everal times, exclaiming, <Q>&startq;That's fal&s;e; that's a lie.&endq;</Q> Next day, when he delivered his an&s;wer in writing to the committee, the earl of Pembroke a&s;ked, Whether the militia might not be granted accord|ing to the parliament's de&s;ire for a time? The king replied with great warmth$ "No, by God, not for an hour."</P>

<P>No wonder that his patience was by this time exhau&s;ted, after hav|ing yielded &s;o much for their &s;atisfaction. He had already pa&s;&s;ed the two bills which they had &s;o eagerly pro&s;ecuted; one for excluding the bi&s;hops from their &s;eats in parliament; and the other for pre&s;&s;ing &s;oldiers into the &s;ervice. He had, on that occa&s;ion, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the two hou&s;es, importing, That he had pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e bilis for the &s;atisfaction of his people, and to &s;hew his pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire of finding &s;ome means to appea&s;e the troubles of the nation: That he
<PB N="269" REF="2710">
would i&s;&s;ue a proclamation, ordering the laws again&s;t recu&s;ants to be vigorou&s;ly executed: That, with the parliament's con&s;ent, he would bani&s;h all Roman prie&s;ts from the kingdom, within the term of twenty days: That he would leave to the hou&s;es the care of reforming the government and liturgy of the church: That if the parliament &s;hould think his pre&s;ence nece&s;&s;ary for the reduction of the rebels in Ireland, he would chearfully venture his per&s;on in that &s;ervice: and, That as he had received a petition from the inhabitants of Suffolk, repre&s;enting the decay of their cloth manufactures, he earne&s;tly recommended the con&s;ide|ration of that affair to both hou&s;es, and would readily concur in any re&s;olution they &s;hould take for the encouragement of commerce. The hou&s;es thanked him for having pa&s;&s;ed the two bills; but took no further notice of his me&s;&s;age. Before the queen embarked for Holland they &s;ent a deputation to her to vindi|cate them&s;elves from a report that was circulated, implying that they intended to accu&s;e her of high trea&s;on. They intercepted and opened &s;ome letters from lord Digby at Middleburg in Zealand, to the queen and Sir Lewis Dives; and de&s;ired her maje&s;ty would not maintain any corre&s;pondence with that nobleman, whom they re&s;olved to impeach as a traitor to his country.</P>

<P>In the mid&s;t of the conte&s;t about the militia, Charles informed the parliament of his re&s;olution to go and put him&s;elf at the head of the Engli&s;h troops in Ireland; as a previous &s;tep to which expedition he intended to rai&s;e a guard of two thou&s;and infantry and two hundred hor&s;e in Che&s;hire and the neighbouring counties; and he de&s;ired the two hou&s;es would &s;ettle a fund for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Whether they believed the king was in earne&s;t, or &s;ought only to fix upon them the odium of a refu&s;al, they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, &s;peci|fying their rea&s;ons for not complying with his demand; declaring that &s;hould he levy tho&s;e troops, without their con&s;ent, they would interpret his conduct into a de&s;ign of in&s;piring the people with terror; and employ their utmo&s;t efforts in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the forces that &s;hould be thus a&s;&s;embled. They likewi&s;e prote&s;ted, that in ca&s;e the king &s;hould ab&s;ent him&s;elf from the realm, they would not obey the commi&s;&s;ioners or regents whom he &s;hould appoint to rule in his ab&s;ence; but that they them&s;elves would govern the kingdom accord|ing to law and the oath of allegiance they had taken. The king, in an an&s;wer to this addre&s;s, refuted all their arguments; and they publi&s;hed a replication: but this affair had no other con&s;equence; nor does it appear that the king really intended to leave England. The animo&s;ity between him and the majority in both hou&s;es had ri&s;en to &s;uch a flame, that each &s;ide thought a civil war in|evitable, and endeavoured to &s;hift the blame from it&s;elf by appeals to the public.</P>

<P>If Charles had yielded the point of the militia for a limited time, in all probability his adver&s;aries would have been greatly embara&s;&s;ed with re&s;pect to their &s;ub&s;equent conduct: but they took care to inflame his re&s;ent|ment, by in&s;erting har&s;h expre&s;&s;ions in their addre&s;&s;es, and he was not yet &s;o de&s;titute as to be under a nece&s;&s;ity of leaving him&s;elf entirely at the mercy of his enemies. On the fifteenth day of March he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to both hou&s;es, &s;ignifying his de&s;ign to go and re&s;ide for &s;ome time at York, recommended the affairs of Ireland to their &s;erious attention: with re&s;pect to the militia he ob&s;erved, that as he had been always careful of their privi|leges, he hoped they would not violate his rights, of which the mo&s;t funda|mental article imported, that his &s;ubjects &s;hould not be obliged to obey any ordinance to which he had not given his a&s;&s;ent. Next day the commons, with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon.</NOTE>
<PB N="270" REF="2720">
the approbation of the upper hou&s;e, re&s;olved, That they &s;hould adhere to their preceding votes concerning the militia: That the king's ab&s;ence was a total<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> hindrance to the affairs of Ireland: That when the parliament, which is the &s;upreme court of the kingdom, declares what is law, no per&s;on ought to que&s;|tion or contradict its orders; and that a prohibition to obey them is a great violation of privileges: That a committee of both hou&s;es &s;hould examine who was author of the la&s;t me&s;&s;age from his maje&s;ty: That tho&s;e who advi&s;ed the king to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from parliament, were enemies to the peace of the king|dom, and might be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected of favouring the rebellion in Ireland. The lords voted that the ordinance for the &s;ecurity of the kingdom was not con|trary to the oath of allegiance: That commi&s;&s;ions under the great &s;eal to lieu|tenants of counties were null and illegal; and, That every per&s;on exerci&s;ing the power over the militia by virtue of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ions, &s;hould be deemed a per|turbator of the public peace. The two hou&s;es concurred in voting, That the kingdom being in manife&s;t danger from foreign enemies, as well as from a po|$$&s;h malignant party at home, there was an indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity for putting $word$ in a po&s;ture of defence: That the two hou&s;es had addre&s;&s;ed his maje&s;ty, that he might &s;ettle the militia of the kingdom in &s;uch a manner as they had judged convenient; but, he had refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent: That, in ca&s;e of extreme danger, and the king's refu&s;al, the ordinance publi&s;hed by the two hou&s;es concerning the militia, was binding upon the people by the fundamental laws of the realm: That tho&s;e appointed lieutenants of counties by the two hou&s;es &s;hould receive their orders for the exerci&s;e of their employments. This was another in&s;tance of the mo&s;t flagrant u&s;urpation in the two hou&s;es, which, neither by law, cu&s;|tom, nor con&s;titution, had the lea&s;t &s;hadow of right to a&s;&s;ume &s;uch authority, or even to arrogate the name of Parliament, without the concurrence of the king, who con&s;titutes the head of that body. Nothing could at any time ex|cu&s;e &s;uch acts of power in the two hou&s;es, except the mo&s;t imminent danger impending over the commonwealth; and here was no danger but of their own creating.</P>

<P>Some time after the&s;e re&s;olutions, they received the king's decla|ration, in an&s;wer to that which had been pre&s;ented to him at Newmarket. Be|fore this was delivered to the hou&s;es, they had fini&s;hed an addre&s;s, by way of reply to the an&s;wer, which he had returned to the committee at Newmarket; and he wrote another reply to their la&s;t remon&s;trance. Their addre&s;&s;es were filled with the mo&s;t invidious in&s;iuations again&s;t the mi&s;conduct of the mini&s;try in the former part of the king's reign; with a rancorous recapitulation of every particular which could be con&s;trued into a breach of privilege; the hackneyed repetition of fears and jealou&s;ies, popi&s;h plots and inva&s;ions, and the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate per&s;everance in demanding the king's a&s;&s;ent to every propo|&s;ition they could make again&s;t his per&s;on and government. A &s;pirit of can|dour, &s;incerity, injured innocence, and good &s;en&s;e, breathes through all the king's an&s;wers. He frankly acknowledged the errors of his former conduct; reminded them of the atonement he had made by his &s;ub&s;equent conce&s;&s;ions; refuted the cruel calumnies which had been forged to his prejudice; explained his motives for refu&s;ing to comply with their demand; and expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire of promoting the happine&s;s of his people. <Q>&startq;If you think (&s;aid $word$ in his la&s;t an&s;wer you have a right to demand what you plea&s;e, and in "whatever $$ile you judge proper; and, if we cannot refu&s;e it, nor give the

In plain Engli&s;h, this is taking from us the liberty of &s;peech; a deprivation which would be unju&s;t, even if we were a &s;ubject: but, being your king, we leave it to others to find a &s;uitable name for &s;uch conduct.&endq;</Q> The two<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> hou&s;es, with a view to make a merit of their conde&s;cen&s;ion, pa&s;&s;ed a bill for e&s;tabli&s;hing the militia, as the king had recommended that method to parlia|ment; but, when it was pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, he refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent, becau&s;e he him&s;elf was excluded from all &s;hare in the regulation. He &s;ignified his rea&s;ons for witholding his a&s;&s;ent. They replied, in a declaration, and he an|&s;wered their reply. They then ordered their ordinance to be put in execution: the king publi&s;hed a proclamation, forbidding all per&s;ons to execute their or|dinance, on pain of being declared perturbators of the public peace: and, on the other hand, the parliament i&s;&s;ued a fre&s;h declaration, prohibiting all the &s;ub|jects from yielding obedience to the king's proclamation, as being contrary to the laws of the realm.</P>

<P>When the king retired to the North, the two hou&s;es &s;u&s;pected that he had formed a de&s;ign for making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Hull; and therefore they petitioned that he would order the magazine to be tran&s;ported from that place to the Tower of London. He gave them to under&s;tand, that he could not con&s;ent to their reque&s;t, until he &s;hould know for what purpo&s;e it was in|tended; and that, &s;hould they attempt to tran&s;port his magazine, without his order, he &s;hould look upon &s;uch an attempt as an expre&s;s violation of his rights. Notwith&s;tanding this declaration, and a petition pre&s;ented to the king by the gentlemen of York&s;hire, de&s;iring that the magazine might not be removed, the parliament cau&s;ed the greater part of it to be depo&s;ited in the Tower. Charles certainly intended to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Hull, and &s;ecure the arms he had purcha&s;ed with his own money. Such &s;teps were, at this juncture, not only excu&s;eable, but even nece&s;&s;ary, for his own pre&s;ervation. On the twenty|third day of April, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf before the gates of Hull, with a re|tinue of three hundred hor&s;e, and demanded entrance, which was refu&s;ed by Sir John Hotham the governor, who appeared upon the rampart, and told him, that he could not receive his maje&s;ty, and &s;uch a numerous train, without betraying the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him by the parliament; but that he might enter with twelve attendants. The king con&s;ented to exclude all his retinue, except thirty followers: but Hotham refu&s;ing to open the gates on the&s;e terms, the king ordered two heralds to proclaim him a traitor, and retired to Beverley, where he pa&s;&s;ed the night. Next day Hotham was again &s;ummoned to open the gates, with promi&s;e of pardon for his former di&s;obedience; but he remained inflexible, and Charles returned to York, extremely chagrined at his di&s;ap|pointment. He demanded reparation of the parliament for the in&s;ult he had &s;u&s;tained. He quoted laws to prove it was the king's office to defend the realm, and take charge of garri&s;ons and magazines; and he claimed that of Hull in particular, as having been purcha&s;ed at his own private expence. The parliament maintained that Hotham had done his duty, pretending that the laws had committed the &s;trengths and magazines of the kingdom to the &s;o|vereign, as a depo&s;it to be employed for the pre&s;ervation, not the ruin of the
<PB N="272" REF="2740">
people. This conte&s;t produced a number of me&s;&s;ages, declarations, an&s;wers, and replies; and, in the mean time, the king's friends endeavoured to obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Hull, by maintaining a corre&s;pondence with an officer of the gar|ri&s;on, who di&s;covered the de&s;ign to the governor, and he &s;ent intelligence of this affair to the two hou&s;es. The attempt had been made by means of a gentleman named Beckwyth, who, on the mi&s;carriage of his &s;cheme, retired to York; and thither the hou&s;es di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to take him into cu&s;tody, but the king would not allow him to execute the order.</P>

<P>Charles, now laying a&s;ide all hope of accommodation, began to prepare for war in earne&s;t. He had already gained over Goring, governor of Port&s;mouth; and the queen was employed in Holland in purcha&s;ing artillery, arms, and ammunition. The earl of Northumberland lord high admiral, being old and infirm, the king conferred the command of the fleet upon Sir John Pennington, who was devoted to his intere&s;t: but the hou&s;es remon&s;trated again&s;t his choice; and, in a paper tran&s;mitted to the lord keeper Littleton, who had by this time repaired to the king at York, in&s;i&s;ted upon his maje&s;ty's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendo$. Ru$hworth.</NOTE> appointing the earl of Warwick commander of the navy. Charles, incen&s;ed at this demand, as well as at the di&s;re&s;pectful manner in which it was commu|nicated, refu&s;ed to comply with their de&s;ire: neverthele&s;s, Warwick found means to u&s;urp the command, by the intrigues of the parliament, and the in|fluence of Northumberland, who favoured his intere&s;t. The two hou&s;es be|gan to put in execution their ordinance touching the militia, and the trained|bands of London were mu&s;tered in their pre&s;ence. They &s;ent deputies to York, on pretence of delivering a me&s;&s;age to the king, concerning Hull and the mi|litia; and, when he would have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with an an&s;wer, they told him they had orders to remain at York, where they acted as &s;pies upon his conduct. In order to di&s;credit the proceedings of his adver&s;aries, he &s;ent private directions to all his friends in both hou&s;es, to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the parliament, and attend his per&s;on; and this command a con&s;iderable number obeyed the more willingly, as their lives were in continual danger from the in&s;olence of the populace, and the violence of tho&s;e members by whom the multitude was actuated.</P>

<P>The king having a&s;&s;embled the freeholders of York&s;hire, pro|te&s;ted, in a public &s;peech, that he had retired to the North with a view to pre|&s;erve the peace of that part of his dominions, and not to make it the &s;eat of war; a de&s;ign of which he had been fal&s;ely accu&s;ed. He &s;aid the two hou&s;es had &s;ent their deputies to brave him, even as far as York: that as they had deprived him of his magazine at Hull; begun to execute their ordinance con|cerning the militia, and approved the trea&s;on of Sir John Hotham, he could no longer doubt that his per&s;on was in the mo&s;t imminent danger. He there|fore re&s;olved to appoint a guard, and demanded their approbation and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Though the gentlemen of that country were generally well affected to his maje&s;ty, they were mingled with a good number of malecontents; and the&s;e being practi&s;ed upon by the committee of the two hou&s;es, pre&s;ented pe|titions, di&s;approving of the king's propo&s;al; which, however, was reli&s;hed by the majority. A troop of hor&s;e-guards was immediately formed of tho&s;e gentlemen who voluntarily inli&s;ted them&s;elves for that &s;ervice, under the com|mand of the prince of Wales; and one regiment of trained-bands was ordered $word$ $o duty without intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>THE nation was now divided between the king and the two hou&s;es. The greater part of the old nobility and antient families in the king|dom, who valued them&s;elves upon the loyalty and virtue of their ance&s;tors, ad|hered to the cau&s;e of their &s;overeign, which was al&s;o &s;u&s;tained by all tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to the antient con&s;titution and the hie$archy. All in general whom nature had endowed with genero&s;ity and benevolence of di&s;po&s;ition, who&s;e man|ners
<PB N="274" REF="2760">
were poli&s;hed by &s;ocial and elegant intercour&s;e, and who&s;e minds were en|larged by a liberal education, glowed with ardour in the cau&s;e of injured roy|alty, upon which nothing reflected more lu&s;tre th$n the approbation and at|tachment of the learned, loyal, and venerable un ver&s;ity of Oxford <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The king was attended at York by lord Littleton, keeper of the &s;eals; the marquis of Hertford, governor to the prince of Wales; lord Falkland, &s;ecretary of &s;tate; the duke of Rich|mond, the earls of So$thampton, Devon&s;hire, Clare, Monmouth, Carnarvon, Cumberland, Salisbury, Cambridge, We&s;tmoreland, Rivers, Newport$ Lind&s;ey, Bath, Dor&s;et, Northampton, Br$&s;to$$ Berk&s;hire, Dover, lords Newark, Rich, Coventry, Capel, Gray of Ruthven, Pawlet, Saville, Dun&s;more, Mowbray, and Martravers; Howard of Charleton, Lovelace, Mohun, Sey|mour. Sir P. Wych comptroller, Secretary Ni|cholas, Sir J. Colepepper chancell$r of the $x|chequer, lord chief ju&s;tice Banks. Many other noblemen were employed in the king's behalf in different parts of the kingdom; and, among the members of the lower hou&s;e who retired to York, was Mr. Hyde, afterwards earl of Clarendon,</NOTE>. The oppo&s;ite faction was compo&s;ed of tho&s;e whom the court had per&s;onally di&s;|obliged; of &s;uch as wanted to fi&s;h in troubled wate$s; of republicans and pro|te&s;tant di&s;&s;enters; comprehending a great number of corporations, manufacturers, and the lower cla&s;s of people, inflamed with the &s;pirit of fanatici&s;m. The traders were generally aver&s;e to the king, partly from the di&s;couragements to which commerce had been &s;ubjected during this reign; partly from a &s;pirit of independence become licentious and in&s;olent; and partly from hatred and emu|lation of the antient families which adhered to the intere&s;t of their &s;overeign: but the greate&s;t advantage the two hou&s;es enjoyed over the monarch, was the countenance and &s;upport of the city of London, the great re&s;ervoir of the na|tional wealth and credit.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; II.</HEAD>
<P>The king i&s;&s;ued a proclamation for transferring the courts of ju&s;tice to York; but the hou&s;es at We&s;tmin&s;ter prevented the execution of this order. He likewi&s;e commanded major-general Skippon to attend his per&s;on; but he received a contrary order from the parliament which he cho&s;e to obey. On the nineteenth of May, the two hou&s;es publi&s;hed a remon&s;trance or declaration, as a reply to the an&s;wers which the king had made to &s;ome former addre&s;&s;es; and he refuted them by another declaration. They recapitulated as u&s;ual all the errors of his conduct; they arrogated to them&s;elves the power of a parlia|ment, as if a parliament could exi&s;t without the concurrence of the &s;overeign: they magnified their own mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ervation of Ireland; they ex|patiated upon the imminent danger to which the nation was expo&s;ed; and they a&s;cribed all tho&s;e dangers to the malignant party by which the king was mi&s;led. Charles, on the other hand, vindicated him&s;elf from their a&s;per&s;ions; detected the ab&s;urdity and pre&s;umption of their a&s;&s;uming the appellation of a parlia|ment; recriminated upon their conduct, their in&s;olent expre&s;&s;ions, their acts of arbitrary power and their &s;upporting individuals who had been guilty of high trea&s;on. He demon&s;trated the fallacy of their imputing to him the delay in &s;ending &s;uccours to Ireland; and the fal&s;ity of tho&s;e dangers, plots, and con&s;piracies, which they them&s;elves had &s;eigned, for the purpo&s;es of blacken|ing the character of their &s;overeign, and keeping up the ferment of the nation. Charles never &s;hone &s;o much as in his adver&s;ity, which called forth the exer|tion of tho&s;e faculties which are not &s;o much employed in the ordinary oc|curences of life. He &s;tood collected within him&s;elf with admirable fortitude, depended upon his own lights, di&s;clo&s;ed a &s;urpri&s;ing extent of under&s;tanding,
<PB N="275" REF="2770">
and rea&s;oned with great &s;trength of argument and preci&s;ion. His me&s;&s;ages, an&s;wers, and declarations, are clo&s;e, clear, and nervous; though the mo&s;t ma&s;terly of tho&s;e performances were penned by the lord Falkland, a nobleman equally remarkable for the elegance of his mind, and the moderation of his temper.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; III.</HEAD>
<P>On the twentieth day of May, the commons pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal votes, im|porting, That the king had formed a de&s;ign to make war upon the parliament: That &s;uch a de&s;ign was contrary to his coronation-oath, and tended to the di&s;|&s;olution of government: and, That all a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in this war &s;hould be re|puted and puni&s;hed as traitors. Then they &s;ent a petition to the king, de|&s;iring he would di&s;mi&s;s the troops he had levied; otherwi&s;e they &s;hould be obliged to &s;ecure the peace of the kingdom by more effectual means. In his an&s;wer he reproached them with having appointed a guard to them&s;elves; and with having commanded the &s;heriffs of counties to oppo&s;e all &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hould a&s;&s;emble by order of his maje&s;ty. On the &s;econd day of June, they pre&s;ented him with nineteen propo&s;itions for re-e&s;tabli&s;hing a good under&s;tanding between the king and parliament; with which, if he had complied, he mu&s;t have &s;hame|fully given up, to an inveterate faction, the whole regal power, prerogative, and dignity: he mu&s;t have contributed to the total overthrow of the con&s;titu|tion in church and &s;tate, betrayed the intere&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, reduced him|&s;elf to the mo&s;t di&s;graceful dependence upon his per&s;onal enemies, and ren|dered his name a reproach among the princes of the earth. To the&s;e propo&s;als he wrote &s;uch an an&s;wer as mu&s;t have &s;atisfied every per&s;on who&s;e judgment was not bia&s;&s;ed by rancour and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but he had to do with a &s;et of men who had planned a total revolution of government, and who had proceeded too far in this de&s;ign to recede with &s;afety. For this rea&s;on, all their votes, re&s;olutions, remon&s;trances, and declarations, were evidently calculated to irri|tate and alarm the minds of the people, inflame animo&s;ities, and widen the breach between the &s;overeign and the two hou&s;es of parliament; whereas Charles, from the beginning of this parliament, bent his whole endeavours towards the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of a good under&s;tanding between him and them, by repeated conce&s;&s;ions, redre&s;&s;ing grievances, and parting with the mo&s;t un|doubted prerogatives of his crown. This was the great aim of his whole con|duct, except when he was provoked by in&s;ults, or &s;educed by ra&s;h coun&s;el into &s;ome indi&s;cretions, from which the mo&s;t upright and cautious minds are not wholly exempt.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>The two hou&s;es having received intelligence that the queen had &s;old or impawned &s;ome of the crown-jewels at Am&s;terdam, publi&s;hed an order, de|claring all tho&s;e concerned in &s;elling or pawning tho&s;e jewels, or in rai&s;ing money for the king, enemies of the &s;tate. The commons likewi&s;e ordered the &s;heriffs of counties to &s;ummon the members who had withdrawn them&s;elves from parliament, to re&s;ume their &s;eats before the &s;ixteenth day of June, on pain of a certain fine, and &s;uch other puni&s;hment as the hou&s;e &s;hould think proper to inflict. At the &s;ame time the upper hou&s;e ordered nine of their members, who had retired to York, to appear at their bar on the eighth day of June, as delinquents. As they excu&s;ed them&s;elves by letters from obeying<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> this order, the commons pre&s;ented an impeachment again&s;t them: the lords publi&s;hed a &s;entence, excluding them from &s;itting in their hou&s;e during
<PB N="276" REF="2780">
the continuance of this parliament, and condemning them to impri&s;onment in the Tower, for &s;uch a period of time as the hou&s;e &s;hould think proper to pre|&s;cribe. On the tenth day of June, the two hou&s;es having received intimation that the king had granted commi&s;&s;ions to levy troops, publi&s;hed propo&s;als for borrowing either money or plate for the defence of the kingdom. Charles, informed of this mea&s;ure, wrote a letter to the mayor of London, forbidding the citizens to lend money to the two hou&s;es. They forthwith i&s;&s;ued a declaration, repre&s;enting the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of putting them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence, again&s;t the violent de&s;igns of the king; and he publi&s;hed a long an&s;wer, reproaching them with their outrageous proceedings, contrary to the fundamental laws of the realm: at length, by a printed order, they pro|hibited all per&s;ons from publi&s;hing any declaration of the king, or other writing, contrary to the ordinances of parliament. The king, &s;uppo&s;ing that the captains of his navy were generally well affected to his per&s;on, deprived the earl of Northumberland of the po&s;t of high admiral; ordered the earl of Warwick to re&s;ign his command, which was given to Sir John Pennington; and wrote to every individual captain, commanding him to weigh anchor from the Downs, and &s;ail directly to Burlington-bay. The captains were very well di&s;po&s;ed towards his maje&s;ty; but the &s;cheme was executed in &s;uch a dilatory and indi&s;creet manner, that Warwick found an opportunity to tamper with the individuals, and confirm them in their attachment to his command, which was renounced by two only; and the&s;e being arre&s;ted, were &s;ent pri&s;oners to London.</P>

<P>Mean while, the earl of Newca&s;tle took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, and Tinmouth, for the &s;ervice of his maje&s;ty, who had by this time received a &s;mall &s;upply of arms and ammunition from Holland, by means of the queen, and his &s;on-in-law the prince of Orange. He appointed the earl of Hertford his lieutenant-general in the we&s;tern counties: the earl of Lind&s;ey was ve&s;ted with the command of the army under the command of the king him&s;elf: Sir Jacob A&s;hley was con$titu$ed general of the infantry; and the command of the cavalry was re&s;erved for the king's nephew prince Rupert, brother to the elector palatine. The lord Digby, in his pa&s;&s;age from Holland, had been taken pri&s;oner in di&s;gui&s;e, and conveyed to Hull, where finding it impo&s;&s;ible to remain long concealed from the knowlege of many per&s;ons well acquainted with his features, he di&s;covered him&s;elf to Hotham, in confidence of his honour and gennro&s;ity. The governor di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with the warme&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of duty and attachment to the king; and a&s;&s;ured him, that if his maje&s;ty would appear before the place with the lea&s;t &s;hew of an army or ar|tillery, he would capitulate immediately after the fir&s;t di&s;charge. Charles, in|fluenced by this promi&s;e, a&s;&s;embled a number of militia, with about &s;even hun|dred hor&s;e, and formed the blockade of Hull, after having publi&s;hed a pro|clamation, &s;pecifying his rea&s;ons for undertaking the &s;iege; and &s;ummoned the town to &s;urrender. But by this time Hotham was &s;o narrowly watched by his own &s;on, and the other officers of the garri&s;on who were devoted to the two hou&s;es, that he excu&s;ed him&s;elf from the performance of his promi&s;e; and the king, being de&s;titute of means to carry on the &s;iege in form, was obliged to<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> de$$$ from the enterprize. In the mean time he had received an addre&s;s from the two hou&s;es, be&s;eeching him to di&s;continue his warlike preparations, remove
<PB N="277" REF="2790">
his forces from Hull, di&s;band his troops, and withdraw his garri&s;ons from Newca&s;tle, Tinmouth, and other places in the county of Lincoln; on which conditions they promi&s;ed to lay a&s;ide the preparations they had begun to make in their own defence. Their terms the king rejected, and in his turn pre&s;ented them with propo&s;als, to which they made no &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. About the beginning of Augu&s;t, Goring governor of Port&s;mouth declared for the king, and was immediately blocked up by &s;ea and land; the earl of Warwick com|manding the fleet, and the militia of the adjacent parts being a&s;&s;embled by a committee of the two hou&s;es, appointed for that &s;ervice. The governor having neglected to furni&s;h the place with &s;alt and corn, was in a few days obliged to capitulate, and retired to Holland. During this &s;hort blockade, the king publi&s;hed a declaration, recapitulating all the cau&s;es of his complaint again&s;t the two hou&s;es; declaring them guilty of high trea&s;on, and forbidding his &s;ubjects to obey their orders.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VI.</HEAD>
<P>At the &s;ame time he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, commanding all per&s;ons who were able to bear arms, to repair, on the twenty-fifth day of Augu&s;t, to Nottingham, where he intended to &s;et up the royal &s;tandard, in conformity with the antient practice of the Engli&s;h kings, when, upon extraordinary oc|ca&s;ions, they needed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their people. Mean while, he detached the earl of Hertford, and &s;ome other noblemen, to manage his intere&s;t in the we&s;tern counties. He him&s;elf repaired to Lincoln, where he borrowed the arms of the trained-bands for the u&s;e of his new-levied troops; and from thence he marched to Nottingham, where he reviewed his cavalry, to the number of &s;even hundred hor&s;emen, well mounted and accoutred. Hearing that the earl of E&s;&s;ex was on his march with two regiments of infantry, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Coventry, he advanced to that city with his hor&s;e, in order to anticipate the enemy; but he was refu&s;ed admittance by the mayor, and returned to Not|tingham very much chagrined, leaving the command of the cavalry to Wil|mot the commi&s;&s;ary-general, who next day retreated &s;hamefully, before twelve hundred men of the enemy's infantry, e&s;corted by one troop of hor&s;e. The king's proclamation had produced &s;o little effect, that when the royal &s;tandard was &s;et up at Nottingham, not a &s;oul appeared but a few trained-bands a&s;&s;embled for that purpo&s;e. Every countenance was over&s;pread with melancholy and de|jection; and the &s;tandard being blown down by a &s;torm, this accident was in|terpreted into an unlucky omen. Indeed nothing could be more melancholy than the pro&s;pect of this unhappy monarch, de&s;titute of troops, arms, ar|tillery, and ammunition, except a very incon&s;iderable &s;upply, altogether ina|dequate to his nece&s;&s;ities, &s;urrounded by timorous friends, di&s;tracted by jar|ring councils, wanting even the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and threatened by a power|ful faction, which had not only de&s;poiled him of his revenue and authority, but al&s;o intere&s;ted the majority and richer part of the nation in its rebellious de|&s;igns: nay, he was expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t immediate hazard from a body of his adver&s;aries, con&s;i&s;ting of five thou&s;and foot &s;oldiers, and fifteen hundred cavalry, who had by this time taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Coventry. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon.</NOTE></P>

<P>In this emergency, the king, by the advice of his council, &s;ent the earls of Southampton and Dor&s;et, Sir John Colepepper, and Sir William Udall, with a me&s;&s;age to the two hou&s;es, propo&s;ing a treaty for an accommodation, declaring his firm re&s;olution to maintain the true religion, and the privileges of
<PB N="278" REF="2800">
his people; prote&s;ting that he earne&s;tly de&s;ired peace; and that, &s;hould his propo&s;al be rejected, God would not impute to him the blood that might be &s;hed in the cour&s;e of their di&s;pute. The deputies were treated with great in|&s;olence and contempt by both hou&s;es; and their an&s;wer imported, that with|out derogating from the privileges of parliament, they could not treat with the king, until he &s;hould have revoked tho&s;e proclamations by which they were de|clared guilty of high trea&s;on. In a &s;ub&s;equent me&s;&s;age, he promi&s;ed to revoke tho&s;e proclamations, and take down his &s;tandard, as &s;oon as they &s;hould fix a day for recalling their declarations, by which all his friends and adherents were treated as traitors to their country. They in&s;i&s;ted on their former an&s;wer, a&s;|&s;uring him, that if he would return to his parliament, after the revocation which they had propo&s;ed, he &s;hould receive &s;en&s;ible marks of their fidelity and obedience; but that the parliament, as repre&s;entative of the kingdom, would never &s;uffer it&s;elf to be put in competition with his maje&s;ty's pernicious coun|&s;ellors. Then they publi&s;hed a declaration, prote&s;ting that they would never lay down their arms, until the king &s;hould have abandoned the delinquents to the ju&s;tice of parliament. Charles &s;ent a third me&s;&s;age, in which he &s;aid the public &s;hould judge whether he or they had manife&s;ted the warmer &s;ollicitude for peace; that &s;hould they in the &s;equel de&s;ire to treat, he would always re|member, that the blood to be &s;hed was that of his &s;ubjects; and that he would return to his parliament as &s;oon as the cau&s;es of his ab&s;ence &s;hould cea&s;e. To this they returned a very acrimonious an&s;wer, charging his &s;oldiers with having committed the mo&s;t violent outrages, and him&s;elf with having not only care&s;&s;ed the agents of the Iri&s;h rebels, but al&s;o with having &s;eized the ammunition, cloathing, and hor&s;es, provided for the reduction of tho&s;e rebels, in order to be employed again&s;t his own parliament. Charles, in a &s;ub&s;equent declaration, ab&s;olutely denied the truth of tho&s;e imputations; ob&s;erving, by way of re|crimination, that the two hou&s;es had made no &s;cruple of u&s;ing again&s;t their &s;overeign one hundred thou&s;and pounds, rai&s;ed for the relief of Ireland; that though the hou&s;e of commons was compo&s;ed of above five hundred members, two hundred had been obliged to relinqui&s;h their &s;eats, by the violence and threats of the majority; and that, of one hundred peers, not above &s;ixteen continued to &s;it in the upper hou&s;e of parliament.</P>

<P>During this conte&s;t, the earl of E&s;&s;ex a&s;&s;embled at Northampton an army of &s;ixteen thou&s;and men, well armed, with an excellent train of artillery. The king, diffident of his &s;afety at Nottingham, began his march towards Wales, with a &s;mall number of troops, ill provided, in hope of &s;ecuring Che&s;ter and Shrew&s;bury. At Wellington, in the neighbourhood of Derby, he harrangued his little army, prote&s;ting, in the pre&s;ence of Almighty God, that he would maintain the true prote&s;tant religion, as e&s;tabli&s;hed in the church of England; that he would defend the rights and privileges of his &s;ubjects; and particularly ob&s;erve tho&s;e laws to which he had given his a&s;&s;ent in the pre&s;ent parliament. He found him&s;elf obliged to u&s;e &s;ome hor&s;es de|&s;igned for the &s;ervice of Ireland, and to borrow arms from the militia of the places through which he pa&s;&s;ed. The inhabitants of Shrew&s;bury received him with the warme&s;t demon&s;trations of joy and affection. There he e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters; and the number of his troops increa&s;ed &s;o con&s;iderably, that in a few days he found him&s;elf at the head of ten thou&s;and infantry, and
<PB N="279" REF="2810">
four thou&s;and hor&s;e. He was &s;upplied with money by &s;ome friends in London; the loyal univer&s;ity of Oxford dedicated the plate of all their colleges to his &s;ervice; and their example was followed by the univer&s;ity of Cambridge. Sir John Byron had been &s;ent to Oxford for this &s;upply, with a &s;mall detach|ment of cavalry; and prince Rupert, who had a&s;&s;umed the command of the hor&s;e, was detached with another body to Worce&s;ter, in order to meet and &s;ecure Byron in his return. Mean while, the earl of E&s;&s;ex re&s;olving to fix his head|quarters in this city, ordered Nathaniel Fiennes to advance, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place; but, this officer finding Byron had entered it with his convoy, re|tired with precipitation. Immediately after his departure, prince Rupert arrived with his brother Maurice, and had &s;carce alighted, when he perceived five hun|dred hor&s;e of E&s;&s;ex's army, commanded by colonel Sandys, advancing through a defile ju&s;t at hand. He and his company immediately mounted; and, with ad|mirable courage and pre&s;ence of mind, attacked the enemy as they came out of the lane: they were totally routed, after having left their commander and about thirty men killed on the &s;pot; and &s;everal officers were taken. The &s;ucce&s;s of this fir&s;t &s;kirmi&s;h wonderfully in&s;pirited the royali&s;ts, and impre&s;&s;ed the enemy with a terror of prince Rupert, who had given &s;uch an early proof of extraordi|nary<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth. Clarendon.</NOTE> conduct and bravery. He forthwith conducted his convoy to Shrew&s;bury, where the plate was coined for the king's u&s;e; and next day the earl of E&s;&s;ex took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Worce&s;ter, where he re&s;ided for &s;ome time, during which he &s;ecured the cities of Hereford, Glouce&s;ter, and Bri&s;tol.</P>

<P>The king had no &s;ooner a&s;&s;embled an army, with which he thought he could act upon the offen&s;ive, than he began his march from Shrew&s;bury to|wards London; and in two days after his departure, the earl of E&s;&s;ex put him|&s;elf in motion to attend his rear. On the twenty-&s;econd day of October, the armies were within &s;ix miles of each other. The king having received intelli|gence that E&s;&s;ex had advanced to Keinton, a village on the borders of War|wick&s;hire, drew up his army on Edgehill, about two miles from the enemy; and on Sunday the twenty-third day of the month, gave them battle. The army of E&s;&s;ex was &s;uperior in number to the royali&s;ts, who did not exceed ten thou|&s;and hor&s;e and foot. He po&s;ted Ram&s;ey, a Scotti&s;h officer, at the head of a thou&s;and hor&s;e, on the left wing. He him&s;elf commanded the line of infantry, with about two regiments of cavalry, extending from Keinton towards Edge|hill; and Sir William Balfour acting under the earl of Bedford, was intru&s;ted with a &s;trong body of hor&s;e as a re&s;erve. The king's right wing of hor&s;e was commanded by Prince Rupert, the left by commi&s;&s;ary Wilmot, and Sir Arthur A&s;hton. The earl of Lind&s;ey, though general, fought on foot at the head of his own regiment, Sir Edmund Verney knight-mar&s;hal carried the king's &s;tandard; and Sir John Byron formed the re&s;erve with his own regiment only. About three o'clock in the afternoon, prince Rupert advancing to charge the left wing of the enemy, Sir Faithfull Forte&s;cue, with his whole troop, de&s;erted from Ram&s;ey, and joined the prince, who charged their adver&s;aries with &s;uch fury, that they were immediately routed, and pur&s;ued for two miles. Wilmot and Sir Arthur A&s;hton met with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the right wing of E&s;&s;ex; and the re&s;erve under Byron joined in the pur&s;uit, leaving the infantry on both &s;ides to di&s;pute the fortune of the day. During this conte&s;t, Sir William Balfour advancing with his re&s;erve, fell upon the flank of the royali&s;ts, and did
<PB N="280" REF="2820">
great execution. The earl of Lind&s;ey was mortally wounded, and his &s;on the lord Willoughby, taken pri&s;oner, while he endeavoured to re&s;cue his father; Sir Edmund Verney being &s;lain, the &s;tandard fell into the hands of the enemy, but was recovered by the valour of captain John Smith. The king's whole in|fantry was thrown into confu&s;ion, and him&s;elf with his two &s;ons in great danger of being taken. When prince Rupert and Wilmot returned from the pur&s;uit, their troops were &s;o fatigued and &s;cattered, that they could not be brought into order &s;o as to renew the charge; and night approaching, left the fate of the day undecided. Each &s;ide kept its ground, and next morning both armies fronted one another. About five thou&s;and combatants lay dead on the field of battle, the greater number of the&s;e having been killed by the king's cavalry. Be&s;ides the earl of Lind&s;ey, and Sir Edmund Verney, the king lo&s;t the lord Aubigney, brother to the duke of Richmond and Lenox. Among tho&s;e who fell on the other &s;ide, were the lord St. John of Bletnezo, elde&s;t $$n to the earl of Boling|broke$ and Charles E&s;&s;ex, an officer of reputation. Lord Willoughby, Sir Tho|mas Lunsford, Sir Edward Stradling, and &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction in the king's army, were taken. His &s;oldiers &s;uffered greatly from the cold, which was very &s;evere in the night; and indeed, both &s;ides &s;eemed to think them&s;elves vanqui&s;hed. E&s;&s;ex retired to Warwick ca&s;tle; and the king having apppointed Ruthven general of his army, in the room of the earl of Lind&s;ey, marched to Banbury, and &s;ummoned the ca&s;tle to &s;urrender. Though the garri&s;on con|&s;i&s;ted of eight hundred infantry, and a troop of hor&s;e, they immediately capitu|lated; and one half of the &s;oldiers inli&s;ted in the king's army. Here he left a garri&s;on, under the command of the earl of Northampton, and next day en|tered Oxford, where he was received with joy and acclamation.</P>

<P>The two hou&s;es, though they arrogated to them&s;elves the victory, were neverthele&s;s overwhelmed with con&s;ternation, when they learned the particulars of the battle; while the king's friends at London &s;eized this opportunity of exag|gerating the exploits of the royali&s;ts, and expatiating upon the nece&s;&s;ity of a peace. On the day that preceded the battle, the two hou&s;es had publi&s;hed a decla|ration, taxing the king with having given commi&s;&s;ions to papi&s;ts, with having &s;ent per&s;ons to levy troops at Hamburgh, and in Denmark, encouraged Iri&s;h rebels, and entertained &s;everal per&s;ons declared guilty of hi$$ trea&s;on, namely lord Digby, Oneal, Williams, Pollard, and A&s;hburnham. They likewi&s;e affirmed, that the je&s;uits had collected money for his u&s;e in foreign countries; and for the&s;e rea&s;ons, they re&s;olved to engage in a &s;olemn covenant, hoping they &s;hould be joined by the Scots, according to the treaty of peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two kingdoms. Charles publi&s;hed two an&s;wers, in which he po&s;itively denied the truth of their imputations; and affirmed there was a great number of papi&s;ts in their army. In their reply to this an&s;wer, they in&s;i&s;ted upon his having granted commi&s;&s;ions to catholics, whom they named: at the &s;ame time, they publi&s;hed a petition, pre&s;ented to the king by the catholics of Lanca&s;hire, begging per|mi&s;&s;ion to provide them&s;elves with arms for his &s;ervice; and his maje&s;ty's an|&s;wer, in which he complied with their reque&s;t. At &s;uch a juncture, when the con&s;titution was unhinged, and the legi&s;lature divided within it&s;elf; when the king was &s;tripped of his prerogative, and a powerful faction had actually taken arms again&s;t his per&s;on, it was natural, it was ju&s;t in him, to embrace the offers of his &s;ubjects, for his own pre&s;ervation; and it was prudent to wa$e
<PB N="281" REF="2830">
di&s;tinctions, which he could not maintain with any regard to his per&s;onal &s;afety. As he claimed the victory at Edgehill, he, in order to fortify his preten&s;ions, and intimidate his adver&s;aries, &s;ent an offer of pardon to the city of London, and &s;everal other towns which had declared for the two hou&s;es. His &s;ecret friends took all occa&s;ions to magnify the advantage, and in&s;pire the people with an aver&s;ion to the war. On the other hand, the parliament re&s;olved to demand peace, to exert their utmo&s;t endeavours for putting them&s;elves in a condition to maintain the war, and to de&s;ire the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Scots, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>The army of E&s;&s;ex was immediately recruited by a great number of apprentices, who enli&s;ted in con&s;equence of an ordinance, importing that all the time of their &s;ervice in the field &s;hould be reckoned as part of their apprentice|&s;hip; and they &s;ent a declaration to Scotland, de&s;iring their brethren of that kingdom to prepare forces to cover their frontiers from the attempts of the popi&s;h army, which the earl of Newca&s;tle had rai&s;ed in the north of England. The king, by the advice of his friends in London, re&s;olved to approach that city, before the agitation produced by the battle &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide, hoping that &s;ome commotion would be rai&s;ed in his favour. With this view he advanced to Reading, which was abandoned with precipitation by Harry Martin, who com|manded the garri&s;on compo&s;ed of the parliament's troops. This motion alarmed the two hou&s;es to &s;uch a degree, that they di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to the king, to de&s;ire he would grant a &s;afe-conduct for a committee of lords and commons, to attend him with an humble petition. He complied with their reque&s;t, ex|cepting again&s;t Sir John Evelyn, who had been proclaimed a traitor. The hou&s;es would not admit of this exception, e&s;pecially as they received informa|tion that the earl of E&s;&s;ex was on his march to London; but, the king proceed|ing as far as Colebrook, their appetite for peace recurred. The apprehen&s;ion of the people grew clamorous and importunate; and the earls of Northumber|land and Pembroke, with three members of the lower hou&s;e, waited upon his maje&s;ty with a petition, that he would choo&s;e his re&s;idence at &s;ome place in the neighbourhood of London, where he might conveniently treat with a commit|tee of parliament, about preventing further blood&s;hed, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the peace of the nation.</P>

<P>The deputies received a very favourable an&s;wer from the king, who pitched upon the ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or, which was in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and they re|turned with a &s;eemingly &s;incere de&s;ire of peace, to make their report to their con&s;tituents, when this fair pro&s;pect of an accommodation was ruined by the impetuo&s;ity of prince Rupert. He was a youth of a very ob&s;tinate temper, and ungracious addre&s;s. Far from craving the advice of more experienced officers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> he had payed no deference to the king's orders, &s;ince he fir&s;t engaged in the &s;er|vice; and acted entirely from the &s;ugge&s;tions of his own head&s;trong ambition. He now advanced with all the cavalry as far as Houn&s;low, and under&s;tanding that E&s;&s;ex had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of King&s;ton, Acton, and Brentford, &s;o that he was in danger of being intercepted, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to the king, de&s;iring he might be &s;u&s;tained by the re&s;t of the army. The infantry immediately began<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarend$n.</NOTE> their march, and the avenues of Brentford being barricaded by the enemy, the place was taken by a&s;&s;ault, after a warm action, in which the king's troops took above five hundred pri&s;oners, eleven pair of colours, fifteen pieces of cannon,
<PB N="282" REF="2840">
and a large qua$tity of ammunition. The hou&s;es loudly exclaimed again&s;t this attack, as a proof of the king's in&s;incerity, and perfidious dealing, though they had no rea&s;on to complain, as they had not demanded a ce&s;&s;ation; and their general had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of King&s;ton and Acton, after their committee had waited upon his maje&s;ty. Neverthele&s;s, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the parliament, im|porting, that what he had done was in con&s;equence of the motions of E&s;&s;ex; that he was &s;till cordially di&s;po&s;ed to peace, and would expect their deputies at Br$ntford. His me&s;&s;enger was maltreated and impri&s;oned; the two hou&s;es affirmed, that the king's de&s;ign was to &s;urprize and plunder the city of London; and they ordered the mayor to &s;end the trained-bands to reinforce the earl of E&s;&s;ex. By this conjunction he was rendered much &s;tronger than Charles. Both armies faced one another a whole day, on the heath, near Brentford; and, in the evening, the king wheeled off to King&s;ton, which the enemy had quitted. He lay at Hampton-Court, from whence he retired to Oat-lands, where fir&s;t hear|ing how his character was a&s;per&s;ed, touching the attack at Brentford, he, in a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;es, repeated his rea&s;ons for the &s;tep he had taken, complained of tho&s;e fal&s;e imputations, and told them he would move to a greater di&s;tance from London, that they might prepare their propo&s;als, without any apprehen&s;ion; or, that if they were aver&s;e to a treaty, he was content to put an end to the mi&s;eries of his people by one deci&s;ive battle. Mean while, he directed his forces to re|tire to Reading, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the pri&s;oners he had taken, after they had pro|mi&s;ed upon oath that they would never bear arms again&s;t their &s;overeign.</P>

<P>The parliament having received offers of men and money from the citizens of London, influenced by Pennington the mayor, pa&s;&s;ed an ordinance, that all &s;uch as &s;hould furni&s;h men, money, hor&s;es, or arms for the &s;ervice, &s;hould be repayed with intere&s;t; and for &s;uch payment, they engaged the public faith of the kingdom. They reinforced the army, care&s;&s;ed the earl of E&s;&s;ex, and con&s;tituted him &s;ole general. Then they petitioned the king to return to his parliament, with his royal, not his martial attendance. To this addre&s;s he returned a &s;uitable reply, &s;till expre&s;&s;ing his de&s;ire to treat of an accommodation. They declared he had no mind to peace; and ordered their general to march with his army to Wind&s;or, after their chaplains Downing and Mar&s;hal had ab&s;olved the &s;oldiers of the oath they had taken at Brentford, to ab&s;tain from carrying arms again&s;t the king. All hope of peace being now vani&s;hed, Charles left a &s;trong garri&s;on in Reading, under the command of Sir Arthur A&s;hton, while he him|&s;elf marched with the re&s;t of his army to Oxford. Wallingford in the neigh|bourhood of that city, the Brill on the edge of Buckingham&s;hire, and Banbury were &s;ecured with garri&s;ons; and the head-quarters for the hor&s;e were e&s;tabli&s;hed at Abingdon: &s;o that he commanded Oxford&s;hire and Berk&s;hire, and influ|enced the counties of Buckingham and Northampton. Marlborough in Wilt|&s;hire being held for the parliament by Ram&s;ey, a Scotti&s;h officer in their &s;ervice, the king &s;ent thither Wilmot, now appointed lieutenant-general of the hor&s;e, with a &s;trong detachment, which entered the town by a&s;&s;ault; they took the governor, officers, and a thou&s;and pri&s;oners, and returned &s;afe to Oxford with four pieces of cannon, and great &s;tore of arms and ammunition: but, this advantage was in &s;ome mea&s;ure ballanced by the misfortune that befel the lord Grandi&s;on, who, with three of four regiments of hor&s;e and dragoons, was taken by the enemy at Winche&s;ter; from whence, however, he made his e&s;cape to Oxford.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XIV.</HEAD>
<P>The king's next &s;tep was to refute the declaration which the two hou&s;es had &s;ent into Scotland. Commi&s;&s;ioners from that kingdom actually re&s;ided in London; and, before the armies took the field, had exhorted the parliament to a reconciliation with his maje&s;ty. He now &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the privy-council of Scotland, complaining of the calumnies which had been cir|culated by the two hou&s;es and their emi&s;&s;aries, to the prejudice of his character; recapitulating the injuries he had &s;uffered, and exhorting his &s;ubjects of Scot|land to per&s;evere in their duty and allegiance. As the king's revenues were intercepted, he was enabled by the loyalty and genero&s;ity of Oxford, the af|fection of his adherents, and particularly by &s;ums drawn from his friends in London, to defray the nece&s;&s;ary expence of his army and hou&s;hold, and even to make preparations for the en&s;uing campaign. When, according to cu&s;tom, he appointed &s;heriffs in all the counties, the commons ordered that every per&s;on &s;o nominated, &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted as a delinquent. Hearing that the king had ordered &s;ome of the pri&s;oners taken at Edge-hill to be indicted for high trea&s;on, they declared all &s;uch indictments illegal; inhibited the judges to pro|ceed; and declared, that if any of their &s;oldiers &s;hould be executed, they would make retaliation upon tho&s;e they had taken pri&s;oners. The king publi&s;hed a proclamation, forbidding all men to pay or receive the duty of tonnage and poundage; and the hou&s;es declared that no per&s;on &s;hould be mole&s;ted on that account. They maintained agents in Holland, Bru&s;&s;els, and France. The prince of Orange had heartily engaged in the cau&s;e of his father-in-law; but the &s;tates-general were united with the parliament by a conformity of civil and religious principles. They prevailed upon Franci&s;co de Melos, governor of Flanders, to di&s;countenance the king's friends in that country. The king of Spain had been incen&s;ed again&s;t Charles for having concluded a league of amity with the crown of Portugal. He had encouraged and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the rebels in Ireland, and now his amba&s;&s;ador at London carried on an intimate corre&s;pon|dence with the two hou&s;es. Richelieu, the French mini&s;ter, had been concerned in exciting the fir&s;t commotions in Scotland. La Fert&eacute;, the envoy from that crown, acted as a &s;py for the parliament; and the huguenots were attached to it by the ties of religion.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XV.</HEAD>
<P>In order to rai&s;e money for their occa&s;ions, the two hou&s;es ordered that committees &s;hould be named for borrowing money and plate to &s;upply the wants of the army; and that they &s;hould take into cu&s;tody all provi&s;ions of money, plate, and hor&s;es, to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy. They ordained, that I&s;aac Pennington, mayor of London, and a certain num|ber of aldermen and citizens, &s;hould be ve&s;ted with authority to impower &s;ix per&s;ons of every ward in London to a&s;&s;e&s;s all per&s;ons who refu&s;ed to contri|bute in &s;ums not exceeding the twentieth part of their &s;ub&s;tance; to di&s;train goods for this purpo&s;e, to receive rents, to compound debts, and even to im|pri&s;on whole families. The king publi&s;hed a declaration, explaining the per|nicious con&s;equences of &s;uch an arbitrary tyrannical impo&s;ition, which de&s;troyed the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential privileges of the people: he required that his loving &s;ubjects would not &s;ubmit to &s;uch an extravagant ordinance, or give any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the army of the rebels, on pain of incurring &s;evere puni&s;hment and perpetual infamy. A great number of citizens, well affected to his maje&s;ty, prepared a petititon to the parliament, recommending a treaty for peace; but the two
<PB N="284" REF="2860">
hou&s;es refu&s;ed to receive it, on pretence that it had been framed by delinquents. Another, of the &s;ame tenor, was drawn up by the inhabitants of We&s;tmin&s;ter, who were treated in the &s;ame ignominious manner. The mayor and aldermen, at the in&s;tigation of the parliament, &s;ent deputies to the king, with a petition, de&s;iring him to di&s;band his army, and return to his parliament. To this he returned an an&s;wer by a gentleman, who was permitted to read it before the common-council of the city, a&s;&s;embled for that purpo&s;e; and in pre&s;ence of a committee of lords and commons, who had taken proper precautions to pre|vent its having any effect to his advantage. The parliament &s;eemed to have nothing &s;o much at heart as the extirpation of epi&s;copacy, for which the com|mons prepared a bill; and, by their intrigues, it pa&s;&s;ed the upper hou&s;e, where otherwi&s;e it would have met with oppo&s;ition. They ob&s;erved, that this was the &s;ole condition upon which the Scots would take arms in their behalf; and they in&s;inuated to tho&s;e whom they knew extremely aver&s;e to this mea&s;ure, that, in ca&s;e of a treaty with the king, this bill would alarm him with &s;uch apprehen&s;ions for the church, that he would be glad to redeem the hierarchy<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> with &s;ome &s;ignal conce&s;&s;ion. This great point being gained, they began to prepare propo&s;itions of peace to be pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>Mean while the civil war continued to rage in different parts of the kingdom. The earl of Newca&s;tle, having levied forces for the king's &s;ervice in the North, was oppo&s;ed in his pa&s;&s;ing the river Tees, that &s;eparates the bi$hopric of Durham from York&s;hire, by young Hotham, at the head of a &s;trong detachment from the army of lord Fairfax, who commanded for the parlia|ment in that country: but the earl forced his pa&s;&s;age, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of York with eight thou&s;and men. He afterwards attacked the intrenchments of Fairfax at Tadca&s;ter; but met with &s;uch a warm reception, that he was obliged to retire, after a very ob&s;tinate action. At Gi&s;borough Sir Hugh Cholmley defeated &s;ix hundred men in the king's &s;ervice, commanded by colonel Slingby, who was taken, with a good number of his followers: and the town of Leeds, garri&s;oned by fifteen hundred men, under Sir William Sa|ville, was a&s;&s;aulted and taken by young Fairfax, &s;on to the general. In the &s;outhern parts of the kingdom, Sir William Saville, for the parliament, redu|ced Farnham, Winche&s;ter, and Chiche&s;ter. In February, prince Rupert took Cirence&s;ter by a&s;&s;ault, and made twelve hundred pri&s;oners. Lord Brook, in attacking &s;ome of the king's troops intrenched at Litchfield, lo&s;t his life; but the po&s;t was taken by his followers. The&s;e, under Sir John Gill, being rein|forced by Sir William Brererton from Nantwich, advanced to Stafford, in que&s;t of the earl of Northampton, who gave them battle on Hopton-heath, though they amounted to three times his number. Their hor&s;e were immediately routed; but the earl, being di&s;mounted, was &s;lain, after he had given repeated proofs of per&s;onal prowe&s;s, and refu&s;ed quarter from the hands of &s;uch infamous rebels. Sir John Byron, who commanded the victorious cavalry, would have attacked them the next day; but they retired by favour of the darkne&s;s. Lord Herbert, who had undertaken the &s;iege of Glouce&s;ter, was &s;urpri&s;ed by Sir William Waller, who routed his forces, and took a great number of pri|&s;oners. Then he reduced the ca&s;tle of Chep&s;tow, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Monmouth.</P>

<P>The war was carried on with &s;till greater vigour in the we&s;tern counties. The marquis of Hertford had been appointed general for the king in that part of the country, and e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters at Bath; but the earl of Bedford, who commanded for the parliament, having rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable force, obliged him to retire into Wales; from whence he detached Sir Ralph Hopton into Cornwall with about five hundred hor&s;e, to manage the king's intere&s;t in that county. This gentleman was well received in Cornwall; and the whole county, through the influence of Sir Bevil Greenvil, declared for his maje&s;ty. Hopton, having a&s;&s;embled three thou&s;and Corni&s;hmen, drove the commi&s;&s;ioners of the parliament from Launce&s;ton, where they had made &s;ome levies, and afterwards from Salta$h; but, as they refu&s;ed to &s;erve in any other county, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them after this &s;ervice: neverthele&s;s, he found means to maintain about five hundred regular troops, with which he made incur&s;ions into Devon&s;hire. The parliament, alarmed at his &s;ucce&s;s, formed an army of the forces they had rai&s;ed in the counties of Dor&s;et, Somer&s;et, and Devon, and conferred the command of it upon the earl of Stamford. This nobleman &s;ent a &s;trong detachment into Cornwall, under Ruthven, a Scotti&s;h officer, gover|nor of Plymouth, who pa&s;&s;ed the river Tamar near Salta&s;h, and advanced to Bradock-down in the neighbourhood of Li&s;kard, where he was encountred and defeated by Sir Ralph Hopton. Ruthven fled to Salta&s;h, which he endeavoured to fortify; and the earl of Stamford, who had proceeded as far as Launce&s;ton, in order to join Ruthven, retired to Tavi&s;tock. The victors dividing their forces, part of them marched with lord Mohun and Sir Ralph Hopton to Sal|ta&s;h, which they took by a&s;&s;ault; Ruthven e&s;caping by &s;ea to Plymouth. The other divi&s;ion, conducted by Sir John Berkley, Sir Bevil Greenvil, and colonel A&s;hburnham, advanced to Tavi&s;tock, which the earl of Stamford abandoned at their approach. Immediately after the&s;e tran&s;actions, the inhabitants of De|von&s;hire and Cornwall agreed to a neutrality, that the &s;eat of war might be re|moved from the&s;e two counties. The &s;ame expedient was propo&s;ed in York|&s;hire; and the articles were actually drawn up between the lord Fairfax for the parliament, and Henry Bella&s;is, heir apparent of the lord Falconbridge, who adhered to his maje&s;ty. The&s;e were &s;ub&s;cribed by the principal per&s;ons of either party; but the parliament di&s;owned the tran&s;action, reprimanded Fair|fax, expre&s;&s;ed their dete&s;tation of a neutrality, and ordered him to proceed according to his former in&s;tructions. About the middle of February, the queen, who had &s;ent repeated &s;upplies of arms and ammunition from Holland for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, took &s;hipping for England; and, arriving at Burling|ton-bay, was received by the earl of Newca&s;tle, who e&s;corted her to York, from whence &s;he was afterwards conducted to Oxford.</P>

<P>The two hou&s;es, having fini&s;hed their propo&s;itions, demanded of the king a &s;afe-conduct for a committee, which was granted in favour of the earls of Northumberland, Pembroke, Sali&s;bury, and Holland, the lords vi&s;|counts Wenman and Dungarnon, Sir John Holland, Sir William Litton, William Pierpoint, Bul&s;trode, Whitelock, Edmund Waller, and Richard Win|wood.

<P>During this congre&s;s he detached prince Rupert, to open a commu|nication between York and Oxford; and he had already made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Bromicham and Litchfield, when he was recalled to undertake the relief of Reading, which by this time was be&s;ieged by the earl of E&s;&s;ex. The garri&s;on was commanded by Sir Arthur A&s;hton; but he being wounded in the begin|ning of the &s;iege, the command devolved upon colonel Fielding. A &s;mall reinforcement of three hundred men, with a &s;upply of powder, was thrown into the place by lieutenant-general Wilmot; notwith&s;tanding which the town was not thought to be in a defen&s;ible condition, and Fielding demanded a ca|pitulation; mean while ho&s;tages were mutually given for a ce&s;&s;ation of arms. The king began his march from Oxford, to relieve the place; but, after an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt, was obliged to retire: &s;o that Fielding &s;urrendered the town on condition of being permitted to retire with all the honours of war. He had, however, neglected to &s;tipulate for the &s;afety of the de&s;erters, who were executed by order of E&s;&s;ex, who&s;e &s;oldiers in&s;ulted the garri&s;on as they marched out, and even plundered the waggons, in contempt of the capi|tulation: an outrage which the king's &s;oldiers retaliated in the &s;equel, as often<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> as they found an opportunity. Fielding was tried by a court-martial, and condemned to death for having &s;urrendered Reading upon &s;uch conditions: but he was pardoned in con&s;ideration of his former &s;ervices, and lived to &s;ignalize his courage and fidelity on many different occa&s;ions,</P>

de&s;erting to the king, and per&s;uaded prince Rupert to beat up the quarters of the enemy, after having particularly informed them of their di&s;po&s;ition. To demon&s;trate the practicability of &s;uch an exploit, he propo&s;ed to go as a volun|teer, with a detachment which he conducted to part of the&s;e quarters, where he defeated &s;ome regiments, and brought a good number of pri&s;oners to Ox|ford. Prince Rupert, encouraged by his &s;ucce&s;s, complied with his advice, in making a more vigorous attack upon that part of their army which was quar|tered at Thame. They departed from Oxford with a &s;trong body of hor&s;e; and, taking a long circuit in the night, arrived by break of day at Wickham, where they cut in pieces two regiments of the enemy: they attacked another quarter with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, and attempted to retire by a bridge, at which they had left a &s;ufficient guard. By this time the earl of E&s;&s;ex had taken the alarm, and detached part of his cavalry, to detain the prince until he &s;hould be able to advance with the infantry. They overtook him on the &s;kirts of Chalgrave-field, where he wheeled about, and charged them with &s;uch impe|tuo&s;ity, that they betook them&s;elves to flight, after having lo&s;t &s;ome of their be&s;t officers; and, among the re&s;t, the celebrated John Hambden, who had acted as colonel of a regiment &s;ince the beginning of the war, and proved in many encounters that his courage was equal to any of his other extraordinary endowments. The candour and moderation, for which this gentleman was di&s;tingui&s;hed, in the beginning of the oppo&s;ition to the king's mea&s;ures, had given way to a violence of animo&s;ity again&s;t the antient con&s;titution, and the per&s;on of his &s;overeign, by whom he had been declared guilty of high trea&s;on. This was an affront he could never forgive: he became pa&s;&s;ionate and even ferocious, di&s;couraged all overtures towards an accommodation; and now his death &s;truck a damp into the hearts of the whole faction. Other officers of di&s;tinction were &s;lain or taken pri&s;oners. The army under E&s;&s;ex was di&s;pirited by the&s;e checks, dimini&s;hed by di&s;temper, and in want of nece&s;&s;aries; &s;o that he thought proper to remove from Thame, and put his troops into quarters of refre&s;hment at St. Alban'$, Uxbridge, and other places in that neighbourhood.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarenden.</NOTE> On the other hand, prince Rupert returned in triumph to Oxford, and recom|mended Urrey to the king in &s;uch warm encomiums upon his courage and con|duct, that he received the honour of knighthood, and was preferred to the command of a regiment.</P>

<P>The king's affairs &s;till wore a favourable a&s;pect in the we&s;tern counties, where the neutrality was over-ruled, as in the North, by the votes and declarations of the parliament. Major Chudleigh, with a body of the enemy, made an attempt upon Launce&s;ton; but, being repul&s;ed, retired to Okington. About the middle of May, the earl of Stamford marching into Cornwall, at the head of &s;even thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot, with a train of artillery, encamped on the top of a hill near Stratton, and detached Sir George Chudleigh with twelve hund|red cavalry, to &s;urpri&s;e the high &s;heriff of the county at Bodmin. The Corni&s;h loyali&s;ts, under lord Mohun and Sir Ralph Hopton, &s;eized this opportunity of attacking their infantry, in the ab&s;ence of their hor&s;e. They formed their &s;mall army into four divi&s;ions, and attacked the hill in &s;o many different parts. After a very warm conte&s;t they met upon the &s;ummit, di&s;armed major-general Chudleigh, routed the parliamentarians, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their cannon and camp, while the earl of Stamford retired with precipitation to Exeter;

and Sir George Chudleigh, with their cavalry, took the &s;ame route from Bod|min, as &s;oon as he was informed of the earl's di&s;a&s;ter. The victorious loyali&s;ts, having received orders to join prince Maurice and the marquis of Hertford, who had advanced as far as Somer&s;et&s;hire, began their march; and joining the marquis at Chard, the two bodies, thus united, amounted to above &s;even thou|&s;and men, in excellent order, with a good train of artillery: thus &s;trengthened they took Taunton, Bridgewater, and Dun&s;tar-ca&s;tle, almo&s;t without oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>The two hou&s;es, immediately after the battle of Stratton, &s;ent Sir William Waller, to rai&s;e an army in the county of Somer&s;et, in order to re|trieve their affairs. He acted with &s;uch &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch, that a detach|ment from his army endeavoured to beat up the quarters of the marquis at Somerton, before he had any intelligence of their approach. They were, however, repul&s;ed by the earl of Carnarvon, who pur&s;ued them &s;o far that he fell into a kind of ambu&s;cade, formed by a &s;trong party of Waller's dragoons, before which he was obliged to retreat in his turn, till he was &s;u&s;tained by prince Maurice; a very &s;mart action en&s;ued, in which the prince exhibited repeated proofs of the mo&s;t intrepid bravery, and the enemy were routed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. The royali&s;ts, having re&s;ted a few days at Wells, advanced towards Sir William Waller, who had fixed his head-quarters at Bath, and received from London a reinforcement of five hundred cavalry, &s;o completely armed with cuira&s;&s;es and defen&s;ive armour, that the loyali&s;ts termed them the lob&s;ters; and, in the &s;equel, found them generally irre&s;i&s;tible. After &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes that were fought with various &s;ucce&s;s, the marquis and prince Maurice marched to Marsfield, five miles beyond Bath, in the road to Oxford. Waller, who&s;e aim was to prevent their joining the king, immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lan&s;|down hill, which he fortified with brea&s;t works and cannon. Then he detached a body of hor&s;e towards Marsfield, from whence they were driven back by the loyali&s;ts, who drew up their forces in order of battle on the plain; but, per|ceiving how advantageou&s;ly the enemy was po&s;ted, they began to retreat to their old quarters. Waller immediately &s;ent his whole cavalry to fall upon their flank and rear; and the new regiment of cuira&s;&s;iers did great execution; &s;o that the king's hor&s;e, hitherto deemed invincible, were broken and di&s;mayed: never|thele&s;s, they were rallied by the valour and activity of their officers, and the enemy fled in their turn. Then the royali&s;ts attacked the hill with &s;urpri&s;ing courage, and gained the &s;ummit after a very ob&s;tinate engagement; the enemy retiring behind a &s;tone-wall, where they faced the king's troops in good order till night, and then retired to Bath, by favour of the darkne&s;s. The marquis was left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field; but the victory was not purcha&s;ed without con&s;iderable damage. Sir Bevil Greenvill was killed in the attack, together with a good number of excellent officers; and next morning, as Sir Ralph Hopton and &s;erjeant-major Sheldon rode about the field, they were blown up with gunpowder, eight barrels of which happened to be in a waggon, and took fire either by treachery or accident. The major died next day, to the un|&s;peakable regret of the army, by which he was beloved for his courage and ami|able di&s;po&s;ition; and Sir Ralph Hopton was &s;o mi&s;erably &s;corched, that they de&s;paired of his recovery. The lo&s;s of this great man, who was the darling of the &s;oldiers, they deemed equivalent to a defeat, and retreated with heavy hearts to Marsfield.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>The marquis then re&s;olved to join his maje&s;ty, and began his march for Oxford; but Waller hung upon his rear with &s;uch vigilance and activity, that he found it impracticable to reach that city with his whole army. It was therefore re&s;olved, that he and prince Maurice &s;hould fight their way through the enemy; and that the infantry and cannon &s;hould remain at the Devizes, until the general could return with a reinforcement from Oxford. This re&s;olution they executed; and Sir William Waller beleaguered the De|vizes. The earl of Crawford marching at the head of his own regiment of hor&s;e, with a convoy of ammunition to the relief of the be&s;ieged, was inter|cepted by a &s;trong body of the enemy's cavalry, and hardly e&s;caped with the lo&s;s of his whole convoy. They were by this di&s;appointment reduced to great di&s;tre&s;s, and hampered &s;o clo&s;e by Sir William Waller, that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to defend the place for any length of time. The king know|ing the importance of relieving them, no &s;ooner under&s;tood their &s;ituation, from the prince and the marquis, than he detached lord Wilmot, with fifteen hundred cavalry, and two field-pieces, to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Waller immediately drew up his forces on Roundway-down, about two miles from the Devizes, in order to prevent the junction of Wilmot and the king's troops; and Wilmot re&s;olved to give him battle, in hope that the infantry would march out and join him during the engagement. Waller advancing with his whole cavalry, to charge the royali&s;ts, met with &s;uch a warm reception, that his invincible re|giment of cuira&s;&s;iers were broken and di&s;per&s;ed, and his hor&s;e routed with great &s;laughter. Then the Corni&s;h infantry arriving from the Devizes, and joining the victorious Wilmot, attacked the enemy's foot with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that almo&s;t the whole body was either killed or taken pri&s;oners; and Waller fled with a few followers to Bri&s;tol, in which there was a garri&s;on of the par|liament's troops. This victory was obtained on the thirteenth day of July, which was doubly fortunate for the king, who, at that very time, met the queen on the field of Keinton, and with her received above two thou&s;and in|fantry, and one thou&s;and hor&s;e, well armed, together with &s;ix pieces of cannon, two mortars, and one hundred waggons of ammunition, which were conveyed in &s;afety to Oxford.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>In order to take advantage of the con&s;ternation with which Wal|ler's defeat had overwhelmed the parliament and their adherents, $Charles con&s;ented to the &s;iege of Bri&s;tol, projected by prince Rupert; and the whole army was employed in this enterprize. The Corni&s;h troops took po&s;t on the &s;ide of Somer&s;et&s;hire, and the prince e&s;tabli&s;hed his quarters on the &s;ide of Glou|ce&s;ter. Nathaniel Fiennes commanded in the place, at the head of five and twenty hundred foot, and a regiment of dragoons. The town was in a good po&s;ture of defence, and the ca&s;tle well fortified, and &s;upplied with men, provi&s;ion, and ammunition. In a council of war, it was determined to pro|ceed by a&s;&s;ault; and the troops began the attack on both &s;ides of the town with &s;urpri&s;ing intrepidity. The Corni&s;h men met with &s;uch difficulties from the nature of the ground, and the ob&s;tinate defence of the be&s;ieged, that, not|with&s;tanding their undaunted courage and re&s;olution, they were repul&s;ed with &s;laughter, with the lo&s;s of many gallant officers. On the other &s;ide, where the place was more acce&s;&s;ible, prince Rupert had better &s;ucce&s;s. Colonel Wa&s;hington entered the line, and made room for the hor&s;e to follow. The
<PB N="290" REF="2920">
enemy forthwith abandoned their po&s;ts and retired within the town; &s;o that the a&s;&s;ailants, at the expence of much blood, had only obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;uburbs, and retained little hope of making them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the city, when the governor demanded a parley. He obtained an honourable capitula|tion, in con&s;equence of which he &s;urrendered the town, and marched out with his arms and baggage: but his &s;oldiers were in&s;ulted and plundered by the royali&s;ts, in revenge for the treatment they them&s;elves had met with at Read|ing; and many other outrages were committed in the city, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the inhabitants were di&s;affected to the cau&s;e of his maje&s;ty. The reduction of Bri&s;tol, though it greatly &s;welled the tide of the king's pro&s;perity, co&s;t him a number of excellent officers, the lo&s;s of whom he &s;everely regreted. Of the Corni&s;h men, major Kendall, Sir Nicholas Stanning, and the two colonels Trevannion and Buck, were either &s;lain or mortally wounded in the attack. In the divi&s;ion of prince Rupert, the colonels Launsford and Moyle were &s;hot from windows, after they had entered the &s;uburbs; and the lord vi&s;count Grandi&s;on died of the wounds he received on this occa&s;ion. He was a young nobleman of unblemi&s;hed honour, invincible courage, and inviolable fidelity. F$$nnes governor of Bri&s;tol was tried by a court-martial for having &s;urrendered that city in a cowardly manner, and condemned to death; but the &s;entence was remitted by the earl of E&s;&s;ex, and he &s;pent the remainder of his life in foreign countries.</P>

<P>About this time the earl of Newca&s;tle, in the North, encountered the lord Fairfax on Ather&s;ton-moor, where the parliamentarians being totally routed, Fairfax retreated with the remains of them into Hull, of which he was appointed governor, in the room of Hotham, whom the two hou&s;es had committed to cu&s;tody. To complete their chagrin, the mo&s;t violent animo&s;ity began to rage between the earl of E&s;&s;ex and Sir William Waller. The earl grew jealous of this favourite, and tired of the war; and Waller taxed him with neglect of duty, in allowing the queen to pa&s;s unmole&s;ted to Oxford, and in &s;uffering Wilmot to relieve the Devizes. All the&s;e concurring calamities made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ion upon the two hou&s;es, that they &s;ent Sir Wil|liam Armyne, young Sir Henry Vane, and two other members, as a deputa|tion to their brethren in Scotland, de&s;iring they would immediately advance with an army to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The king had, before this happy turn of his affairs, i&s;&s;ued a declaration, declaring the proceedings of the two hou&s;es to be void, as the members did not enjoy the freedom and liberty of parliament; and now he publi&s;hed a declaration, re-capitulating his late &s;ucce&s;&s;es, repeating the prote&s;tation he had made in the beginning of war, expre&s;&s;ing his eager de|&s;ire of peace, his intention to govern by the laws of the land, and maintain the privileges of parliament, and requiring his good &s;ubjects to a&s;&s;i&s;t him vigor|ou&s;ly with men and arms, plate, money, and hor&s;es, that he might the &s;ooner be enabled to put an end to the calamities of the nation.</P>

<P>This declaration co-operating with the victories he had gained, produced &s;uch effects among his adver&s;aries and their adherents, that if he had marched directly to London, before the fears of the parliament &s;ub&s;ided, in all probability the war would have been fini&s;hed to his honour and advantage; but he had ca&s;t his eyes upon the city of Glouce&s;ter, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which would have made him ma&s;ter of the whole Severne, and enabled him to &s;upply his
<PB N="291" REF="2930">
garri&s;ons at Worce&s;ter and Shrew&s;bury from the city of Bri&s;tol, the command of which was now be&s;towed upon prince Rupert, though the government was ve&s;ted in Sir Ralph Hopton, promoted about this time to the dignity of a baron. The garri&s;on of Glouce&s;ter was commanded by colonel Ma&s;&s;ey, a &s;oldier of fortune, who had formerly &s;erved in the king's army under colonel William Leg, during the la&s;t war with Scotland. This gentleman &s;ounded his inclination towards his maje&s;ty by a letter, to which he returned a very blunt an&s;wer; but he in private de&s;ired the me&s;&s;enger to tell colonel Leg, that the king might depend upon his attachment. He &s;aid, if prince Rupert &s;hould be &s;ent to be&s;iege Glouce&s;ter, he would defend it to extremity; but to his ma|je&s;ty in per&s;on, he would &s;urrender at the fir&s;t &s;ummons. In con&s;equence of this promi&s;e, Charles re&s;olved to march thither without delay. He detached prince Maurice and the earl of Carnarvon towards Dorche&s;ter, with a body of hor&s;e and foot, to extend his intere&s;t in the we&s;tern counties; and he him&s;elf, attended by the marquis of Hertford, &s;et out for Glouce&s;ter, in the neighbour|hood of which he arrived on the tenth day of Augu&s;t. He forthwith &s;ent a trumpet, to &s;ummon the town to &s;urrender; and the me&s;&s;enger returned with two meagre deputies, who demeaned them&s;elves with great in&s;olence, and pre&s;ented a paper, declaring the citizens would, with God's help, keep the town, according to the commands of his maje&s;ty, &s;ignified by both hou&s;es of parliament. This was &s;ub&s;cribed by the governor, the mayor, thirteen aldermen, and a great num|ber of the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial inhabitants. Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;appointment, the king's council re&s;olved that the place &s;hould be be&s;ieged; and Sir William Vava&s;our, who commanded for his maje&s;ty in South Wales, was ordered to draw his forces to the fore&s;t-&s;ide of the town, to overawe and re&s;train the be|&s;ieged, who had broken down the bridges, &s;et fire to the &s;uburbs, and prepared for a vigorous defence.</P>

<P>Mean while, the parliament, which had hitherto acted with &s;uch unanimity, began to be di&s;tracted with divi&s;ions and con&s;piracies. Edmund Waller, the celebrated poet, had, with keen &s;atire, and admirable eloquence, oppo&s;ed the violent coun&s;els by which the commons were governed. He en|joyed the confidence of the earl of Northumberland, Conway, and other per|&s;ons of moderation, who dete&s;ted the furious proceedings of the lower hou&s;e. He concerted with his brother-in-law Mr. Tomkyns, and Mr. Chaloner the intimate friend of that gentleman, an a&s;&s;ociation of the lords and citizens, to refu&s;e payment of the illegal taxes impo&s;ed by the parliament without the royal a&s;&s;ent. Their di&s;cour&s;e was overheard by a &s;ervant of Tomkyns, who be|trayed it to Pym. All three were apprehended, tried by a court-martial, and condemned to death. Tomkyns and Chaloner were executed on gibbets erected before their own doors: Waller redeemed him&s;elf by informing again&s;t his friends, counterfeiting &s;orrow and remor&s;e, bribing the puritanical mini&s;ters, and paying a fine of ten thou&s;and pounds. Then the lords and commons &s;ub&s;cribed a covenant, which they impo&s;ed upon their army, ex|pre&s;&s;ing their abhorrence of the late con&s;piracy, and their re&s;olution to amend their lives; vowing that they would never lay down their arms &s;o long as the papi&s;ts, in open war again&s;t the parliament, &s;hould be &s;creened from ju&s;tice; and promi&s;ing to contribute their uttermo&s;t in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the two hou&s;es again&s;t the king's army. The in&s;olence of the faction was now ri&s;en to &s;uch a pitch, that they openly accu&s;ed the queen of high trea&s;on, and pre&s;ented an impeachment of her

to the upper hou&s;e. An in&s;ult which the king re&s;ented &s;o warmly, that he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, forbidding his &s;ubjects to obey the orders of the two hou&s;es, which he no longer acknowledged as the parliament.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e bold mea&s;ures, the reduction of Bri&s;tol was no &s;ooner known, than the lords began to deliberate upon expedients for peace, and communicated propo&s;itions for that purpo&s;e to the commons, which produced vehement debates, between the violent party and tho&s;e who were in|clined to a &s;olid pacification; but at length it was determined by a majority, that the propo&s;itions &s;hould be tran&s;mitted to his maje&s;ty. The faction im|mediately began to ply all their engines to cloud this pro&s;pect of an accom|modation. The pulpits re&s;ounded with arguments and exclamations again&s;t a treaty: printed papers were di&s;tributed and pa&s;ted upon all public places, ex|horting the people to ri&s;e as one man, and repair to the hou&s;e of commons next morning, as twenty thou&s;and Iri&s;h rebels were landed for their de&s;truction. A petition again&s;t peace was drawn up in the common-council, and pre&s;ented to the lower hou&s;e by Pennington the lord mayor; and all We&s;tmin&s;ter was filled with tumult. Many moderate members withdrew them&s;elves from the hou&s;e, where they could no longer &s;it in &s;afety; while the others thanked the city for their petition and advice, and the propo&s;itions for peace were rejected. A great number of the wives of citizens delivered a petition for peace; but they were attacked, and many of them killed and wounded, by a troop of hor&s;e commanded by one Harvey. The two hou&s;es received Waller after his defeat with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem. He was cho&s;en commander in chief of the forces and militia of London; and they declared that they would enable him to take the field again, to relieve their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed friends in the We&s;t. They pa&s;&s;ed an ordinance to rai&s;e a new army, under the command of the earl of Manche&s;ter, to oppo&s;e the earl of Newca&s;tle, and protect the a&s;&s;ociated counties of E&s;&s;ex, Hertford, Cambridge, Norfolk, Suffolk, Huntington, and Lincoln. Then they &s;ent a committee of both hou&s;es to &s;oothe the earl of E&s;&s;ex, who had been for &s;ome time di&s;gu&s;ted; and had indeed conferred with the moderate party, upon expedients to force the two hou&s;es into pacific mea|&s;ures. Whatever arguments the committee u&s;ed, he was per&s;uaded to re-adopt their &s;entiments; and his other friends fearing he would di&s;cover their de&s;ign, withdrew them&s;elves from the parliament. The earl of Portland, lord Love|lace, and lord Conway, repaired to Oxford; and their example was followed by the earl of Clare. The earls of Bedford and Holland e&s;caped to the king's garri&s;on at Wallingford; and the earl of Northumberland retired to his own hou&s;e at Petworth in Su&s;&s;ex.</P>

<P>While the king was employed in the &s;iege of Glouce&s;ter, the city of Dorche&s;ter, Weymouth, and Portland, &s;urrendered to the earl of Car|narvon, who left his army under the command of prince Maurice, and re|paired to the king, in di&s;content at &s;ome outrages which the troops had com|mitted with impunity. Sir John Digby routed a body of the parliament's forces at Torrington; Barn&s;taple and Bediford were &s;urrendered to him without oppo&s;ition; and prince Maurice undertook the &s;iege of Exeter, which was de|livered into his hands on capitulation, by the earl of Stamford. The &s;iege of Glouce&s;ter proceeded &s;lowly, from the king's want of nece&s;&s;aries for &s;uch an enterprize; and the valour and vigilance of Ma&s;&s;ey, who made repeated &s;allies, in which the be&s;iegers &s;u&s;tained incredible damage.. At length the earl of E&s;&s;ex
<PB N="293" REF="2950">
undertook the relief of the place. The two hou&s;es &s;upplied him with forces, among which he mu&s;tered four regiments of the city trained-bands; and to|wards the end of Augu&s;t he began his march from London. The rendezvous of his troops was at Ayle&s;bury, where, being joined by the lord Gray, and re|inforcements from the a&s;&s;ociated counties, he found him&s;elf at the head of eight thou&s;and infantry, and half that number of hor&s;e. Then he continued his march by Brackley: though he was a little incommoded by a de|tachment of the king's hor&s;e, &s;ent on purpo&s;e to harra&s;s him with light &s;kir|mi&s;hes, he proceeded with great expedition; and the king's forces abandoning their works at his approach, entered Glouce&s;ter in triumph, when the garri&s;on was reduced to extremity. Having &s;upplied the town with provi&s;ion, ammu|nition, and a reinforcement of &s;oldiers, he marched to Tewk&s;bury; from whence he made a &s;udden motion to Cirence&s;ter, where he &s;urprized two re|giments of the royali&s;ts, and &s;eized a great quantity of provi&s;ions prepared for the king's army: then he took his route through the northern parts of Wilt|&s;hire, having marched twenty miles before the king was informed of his motions.</P>

<P>Prince Rupert was immediately detached over the hills, to inter|cept him in his march, and amu&s;e him with &s;kirmi&s;hes, until the king in per|&s;on &s;hould bring up the infantry. He performed this &s;ervice with &s;uch expe|dition, that before the enemy reached Newbury, he charged, and put their rear in confu&s;ion; and, though they behaved with great conduct and re&s;olu|tion, he compelled them to &s;horten their intended march, and take up their quar|ters at Hungerford. Next day, which was the &s;eventeenth of September, the king took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Newbury with his foot; &s;o that E&s;&s;ex was obliged to pa&s;s the night in the open field; and was indeed in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that in all probability he would have found it extremely difficult to extricate him&s;elf, had the royali&s;ts avoided a battle: but he was obliged to the impetuo&s;ity of &s;ome young officers, who de&s;pi&s;ed &s;uch maxims of caution. He drew up his men in order of battle, upon Bigs-hill, within a &s;hort mile of Newbury, and made &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition as became a general of his conduct and experience. The royali&s;ts began to &s;kirmi&s;h in &s;mall &s;ucce&s;&s;ive parties, until they were in|&s;en&s;ibly engaged &s;o far, that the king found it nece&s;&s;ary to hazard a general action. The king's hor&s;e charged with their u&s;ual intrepidity, and even routed the cavalry of E&s;&s;ex; but they could make no impre&s;&s;ion upon his foot, behind which the hor&s;e rallied as often as they were put in confu&s;ion. The London trained-bands, in particular, oppo&s;ed them&s;elves like a rampart again&s;t the efforts of the royali&s;ts, and managed their pikes with &s;uch dexterity, that prince Rupert attacked them in vain, at the head of his choice cavalry. The battle was fought all day, with equal ob&s;tinacy on both &s;ides; and night parted the combatants, before either army could claim the victory. The king recalled his troops from the field; and next morning the earl of E&s;&s;ex pur&s;ued his march towards Reading, which he reached with his cannon and baggage, after his rear had been &s;everely handled by prince Rupert, who charged it when entangled in defiles, at the head of his hor&s;e, and one thou&s;and mu&s;queteers. Though the num|ber of men &s;lain in the battle of Newbury was not very con&s;iderable, the king &s;u&s;|tained irreparable lo&s;s in the fate of &s;ome worthy noblemen who fell in the en|gagement. The earl of Sunderland, a young nobleman of promi&s;ing parts, was killed by a cannon-bullet. The earl of Carnarvon, who had &s;erved his royal ma&s;ter with &s;uch courage and ability, was run through the body with a &s;word,

and expired in an hour after he had received the wound; but the theme of uni|ver&s;al lamentation was the death of the great, the good, the amiable Lucius Cary lord vi&s;count Falkland, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, the darling of the mu&s;es, the patron of learning and merit, the mirrour of integrity, and the pattern of con&s;ummate virtue. This excellent per&s;on had con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed the crown in tho&s;e mea&s;ures which he deemed dangerous to the liberty of the &s;ubject, and the privileges of parliament: but, when he perceived the drift of the dema+gogues was to ruin the con&s;titution; that the king had &s;ufficiently atoned for the errors of his conduct, during the fir&s;t part of his reign, by the manifold conce&s;&s;ions he had made in favour of his people, he di&s;claimed their pro|ceedings, and e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of his &s;overeign in di&s;tre&s;s: yet, he was &s;o much afflicted at &s;eeing his country involved in the calamities of a civil war, that he lo&s;t his former &s;erenity of temper; he became &s;ilent, pen&s;ive, and re|&s;erved; and, in the mid&s;t of his friends, the word "Peace" often broke from him with a profound &s;igh. He eagerly forwarded every overture of an ac|commodation; and, that this conduct might not &s;eem the re&s;ult of per&s;onal timi|dity, he expo&s;ed him&s;elf on all occa&s;ions to the mo&s;t imminent hazard, as if he had de&s;pi&s;ed life, or been enamoured of danger. When his temper fir&s;t changed, he began to neglect the exterior ornaments of his per&s;on, in which he had been formerly exact and curious; but, in the morning of the battle, as if he had fore&s;een his fate, he be&s;towed extraordinary pains upon his ap|parel, &s;aying, the enemy &s;hould not find his body in a &s;lovenly condition. <Q>&startq;I am weary of the times (added he) and fore&s;ee much mi&s;ery to my country; but believe I &s;hall be out of it before night.&endq;</Q> He charged in the front of lord Byron's regiment, and being &s;hot in the belly, fell from his hor&s;e; but<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon.

This is one of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed characters which we find upon record; and his death the more lamentable, as he d$ed in the four and thirtieth year of his age.</P>

<P>The earl of E&s;&s;ex having refre&s;hed his men at Reading, quitted that place, which was immediately &s;ecured for the king, with a &s;trong gar|ri&s;on, commanded by Sir Jacob A&s;hley; and his maje&s;ty retired to Oxford. E&s;&s;ex, by &s;low marches, returned to London, where he was received with joy and acclamation; and the two hou&s;es appointed a &s;olemn thank&s;giving, not only for his &s;ucce&s;s in relieving Glouce&s;ter, but al&s;o for the &s;ignal victory h$ had obtained at Newbury. Indeed this action might have been fatal to the king, had Sir William Waller, who was quartered at Wind&s;or with four thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot, advanced to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of E&s;&s;ex: but he did not at all intere&s;t him&s;elf in the fortune of that nobleman; though they were after|wards formally reconciled to each other by the mediation of the two hou&s;es. The king's little court was di&s;tracted by cabals. Prince Rupert thwarted the marquis of Hertford: the queen had her own favourites, among whom the principal was the lord Jermyn. The earls of Bedford, Clare, and Holland, were treated with coldne&s;s and re&s;erve, even after they had &s;erved at the &s;iege of Glouce&s;ter, and behaved with remarkable gallantry at the la&s;t battle. They re|&s;ented this impolitic conduct of the king, who was incapable of di&s;&s;imulation; and took the fir&s;t opportunity of returning to the parliament, from which they ea&s;ily obta$ned forgivenne&s;s: the earl of Northumberland being informed of the recep|tion they had met with at Oxford, re&s;umed his &s;eat in the hou&s;e of lords, without being que&s;tioned, as he had never manife&s;ted his intention to de&s;ert their cau&s;e.</P>

<P>The committee of the commons which had been &s;ent into Scot|land, met with all the &s;ucce&s;s they could de&s;ire in their negotiation with the con|vention of e&s;tates, and the general a&s;&s;embly of that nation. They declared them&s;elves ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t their brethren of England; and propo&s;ed that the two kingdoms &s;hould agree in a covenant for the extirpation of prelacy, and a more intimate union of the Engli&s;h and Scotti&s;h parliaments. A draught of &s;uch a covenant was tran&s;mitted to the two hou&s;es at We&s;tmin&s;ter, where it was received with applau&s;e; and &s;ub&s;cribed by the lords, commons, and a&s;&s;embly of divines. By this &s;olemn league and covenant, they bound them&s;elves to pre|&s;erve the reformed religion in the three kingdoms; to promote a uniformity in doctrine and di&s;cipline; to extirpate popery and prelacy; to maintain the privi|leges of parliament and the liberties of the people; to defend his maje&s;ty's per|&s;on and authority, in the pre&s;ervation and defence of the true religion, and the liberties of the kingdom; to di&s;cover incendiaries and malignants, that they might receive condign puni&s;hment; to promote a firm peace and union to all po&s;terity; to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another with all their power, renounce neutrality, and re&s;i&s;t temptation; to humble them&s;elves for their &s;ins, amend their lives, and vie with each other in the great work of reformation. This covenant was read in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitelock.</NOTE> St. Margaret's church at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in pre&s;ence of both hou&s;es; and the com|mons ordered that it &s;hould be taken next Sunday by all per&s;ons in their re&s;pective pari&s;hes. The Scots, on this occa&s;ion, were partly influenced by temporal in|tere&s;t, and partly by fanatici&s;m. They began to fear, that &s;hould the king tri|umph over the two hou&s;es, he would retract all the conce&s;&s;ions which had been extorted from him by the Scotti&s;h nation. They were inflamed with the hope of e&s;tabli&s;hing their darling pre&s;bytery in England, and even extending it to the remote&s;t regions, and &s;ome of them were allured with the pro&s;pect of &s;har|ing the &s;poils of the royali&s;ts.</P>

<P>In the beginning of the &s;pring, the earl of Loudon, chancellor of Scotland, with other commi&s;&s;ioners of that kingdom, attended by their apo&s;tle Hender&s;on, had vi&s;ited the king at Oxford, and renewed their offer of me|diation. They even, in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing &s;ollicitations, recommended the pre&s;|byterian model of wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline; and he was obliged to de&s;ire they would be contented with the conce&s;&s;ions he had already made in their favour. They met with no better &s;ucce&s;s, in reque&s;ting him to &s;ummon a Scotti&s;h parlia|ment; and in demanding a pa&s;&s;port for London, where they intended to confer with the two hou&s;es. Thus baffled in all their endeavours, they returned highly di&s;contented, to their own country. As they could not prevail upon the king to convoke a parliament, the con&s;ervators of the peace, lately cho&s;en to maintain the confederacy with England, a&s;&s;embled in his maje&s;ty's name, a convention of the e&s;tates, which, as well as the parliament, was ve&s;ted with power to levy troops, and impo&s;e taxes. The duke of Hamilton, and his brother the earl of Lanerk, had undertaken to oppo&s;e the king's adver&s;aries in this a&s;&s;embly: but, either from want of &s;incerity, or power, they concurred with them in all their tran&s;|actions. The Scotti&s;h covenanters were them&s;elves over-reached by the pro|found craft and impenetrable di&s;&s;imulation of Sir Henry Vane, who, though he hated pre&s;bytery, as much as he was aver&s;e to epi&s;copacy, acquie&s;ced in all their demands, a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in drawing up the covenant, &s;eemed to enter warmly into their religious views, and loudly extolled their di&s;cipline, which in his
<PB N="296" REF="2980">
heart he de&s;pi&s;ed. Thus cajoled, and encouraged with the &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and pounds, advanced to them on the credit of the two hou&s;es, they began to a&s;&s;emble their forces with great alacrity; and, in a little time, their army amounted to twenty thou&s;and men, the command of whom they be&s;towed upon their old general the earl of Leven, who accepted the office without he&s;itation, though he had &s;olemnly promi&s;ed that he would never bear arms again&s;t his<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$arendon.</NOTE> maje&s;ty. In the treaty between the two nations, it was &s;tipulated, that a com|mittee of the Scots &s;hould always fit with the clo&s;e committee at We&s;tmin&s;ter, for carrying on the war with equal authority; and that there &s;hould be no treaty of peace without the joint con&s;ent of the parliaments of both kingdoms.</P>

<P>About this time, the count D'Harcourt arrived in London, as am|ba&s;&s;ador extraordinary from the king and queen regent of France, to offer their good offices towards a reconciliation between the king and his parliament. He was received with great ceremony by the two hou&s;es, and vi&s;ited the king at Oxford. At his return from thence, he &s;ent a paper to the earl of Northum|berland, de&s;iring he would intimate to parliament, that the king his ma&s;ter, and the queen his mi&s;tre&s;s, were extremely de&s;irous of interpo&s;ing their good offices for re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the peace of England; and, that if they would explain the rea|&s;ons that induced them to take up arms, he would endeavour to propo&s;e &s;uch ex|pedients as might effect an accommodation. The two hou&s;es accepted the offer of the king and queen regent of France, with all due re&s;pect; and a&s;&s;ured him, that when he &s;hould make any propo&s;itions to the parliament, by authority from their maje&s;ties of France, they would return &s;uitable an&s;wers. He had, at his fir&s;t arrival in Oxford, propo&s;ed an alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive between the king and his ma&s;ter; and afterwards, when Charles agreed to the propo&s;al, he waved it on a frivolous pretence; but, promi&s;ed that the court of France &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t the king of England in every thing that might contribute to the re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of his authority. After &s;ome &s;light efforts to produce a negotiation, he quitted the kingdom, not without &s;u&s;picion of having fomented tho&s;e diffe|rences which he pretended to compromi&s;e. Richelieu was now dead, but &s;uc|ceeded in the mini&s;try by cardinal Mazarin, who adopted the maxims of his predece&s;&s;or.</P>

<P>The two hou&s;es having prepared a new great-&s;eal, exactly re|&s;embling that which the lord-keeper Lyttleton had delivered to the king, pub|li&s;hed an ordinance, declaring void and invalid, all grants and letters-patent, which had pa&s;&s;ed the great-&s;eal &s;ince the keeper left the hou&s;e; ve&s;ting their own &s;eal with the whole authority; and pronouncing that who&s;oever &s;hould, for the future, pa&s;s or claim any thing under another great-&s;eal, &s;hould be held an enemy to the &s;tate. It was committed to &s;ix commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;olemnly &s;worn to execute the office of keepers of the great-&s;eal, according to the orders of both hou&s;es of parliament; and the fir&s;t in&s;tance in which they u&s;ed it, was a patent con&s;tituting the earl of Warwick lord high-admiral of England. The king having &s;ent writs to the judges of We&s;tmin&s;ter for adjourning the term to Ox|ford, the me&s;&s;engers were tried by a court-martial as &s;pies, and condemned to be hanged: one was accordingly executed, and the other committed to Bridewell. Charles, notwith&s;tanding his &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the cour&s;e of the campaign, had met with divers checks that had an unfortunate influence on his affairs. Be&s;ides his being obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Glouce&s;ter, and the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained at
<PB N="297" REF="2990">
Newbury, three thou&s;and of the king's men, under major-general Goring, were defeated at Wakefield, by young Fairfax; and their commander fell into the hands of the enemy: lord Withrington with part of the troops belonging to the marquis of Newca&s;tle's forces, were routed at Horn-ca&s;tle in Lincoln&s;hire, by the earl of Manche&s;ter, lord Willoughby, and Oliver Cromwell: he was likewi&s;e obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Hull, which he had undertaken in con&s;e|quence of a corre&s;pondence with the two Hothams, who were detected and &s;ent pri&s;oners to London; and the Scots were by this time in a condition to enter England. In hope of averting the &s;torm from Scotland, the peers at Oxford &s;ub&s;cribed a letter to the Scotti&s;h council of &s;tate, repre&s;enting the foulne&s;s of the rebellion rai&s;ed by the two hou&s;es at We&s;tmin&s;ter, reminding them of their obligation to the king, and conjuring them to de&s;i&s;t from their purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the parliament: then the king, to convince his &s;ubjects of the prepo&s;terous claim which the remnant at We&s;tmin&s;ter laid to the appellation of parliament, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, &s;ummoning the members of both hou&s;es to a&s;&s;emble at Oxford, on a certain day in January fixed for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>His next expedient for his own defence, was a &s;cheme to u&s;e part of the troops that &s;erved in Ireland again&s;t the rebels of that kingdom. The Engli&s;h parliament had taken no other effectual &s;tep to di&s;tre&s;s the Iri&s;h Ro|man catholics, but that of contracting with the Scots, who &s;ent over a good number of troops, that made a diver&s;ion from Dublin, and protected the Briti&s;h planters in the north. Notwith&s;tanding the great inequality of numbers, the Engli&s;h troops in that kingdom had routed the rebels in many encounters; and the earl of Ormond had obtained two &s;ignal victories over them. Never|thele&s;s, as the two hou&s;es neglected to &s;upply them with provi&s;ion, ammunition, and recruits, they were by this time de&s;titute of the common nece&s;&s;aries of life. The ju&s;tices who were di&s;&s;affected to the king, had been removed by the influ|ence of Ormond, and their places &s;upplied with others who wi&s;hed well to his maje&s;ty: for this rea&s;on, the parliament payed the le&s;s regard to their &s;ollicita|tions. They tran&s;mitted to the two hou&s;es a remon&s;trance from the army, de|&s;cribing their deplorable &s;ituation, and de&s;iring leave to quit the kingdom, otherwi&s;e they &s;hould have recour&s;e to tho&s;e means with which nature had fur|ni&s;hed them for their own pre&s;ervation. The rebels had &s;ent repeated pe|titions to the king, be&s;eeching him to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners to hear what they could &s;ay in their own vindication. Influenced by the&s;e concurring motives, he authorized Ormond and the ju&s;tices to conclude a ce&s;&s;ation for one year, with the council of the rebels at Kilkenny; and ordered the earl to tran&s;port part of the army to England.</P>

<P>The lords and commons meeting at Oxford, agreed, with the king's approbation, to &s;end a trumpet with a letter to the earl of E&s;&s;ex, expre&s;|&s;ing their earne&s;t de&s;ire to heal the bleeding wounds of their country, and con|juring him to communicate this their de&s;ire to the two hou&s;es at We&s;tmin&s;ter, that per&s;ons might be appointed on either part to treat of an accommodation. This letter was &s;ub&s;cribed by three and forty noblemen, dukes, marqui&s;&s;es, earls, vi&s;counts, and barons, and one hundred and eighteen members of the hou&s;e of commons; whereas, not above two and twenty peers were engaged in the oppo&s;ite party. The earl of E&s;&s;ex &s;ent back the trumpeter with a &s;hort billet to the king's general, the earl of Brentford, importing, that he could not
<PB N="298" REF="3000">
communicate the letter to parliament, because it was not addre&s;&s;ed to the two hou&s;es. At the &s;ame time, he tran&s;mitted copies of the national covenant, and a canting declaration of both kingdoms, pronouncing the cur&s;e of Meroz upon tho&s;e who &s;hould not come to help the Lord again&s;t the mighty. The king, without intermitting his preparations for war, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the lords and commons at We&s;tmin&s;ter, propo&s;ing a treaty: and to this they replied, That they were re&s;olved to defend the rights of parliament with their lives and for|tunes, de&s;iring his maje&s;ty's hearty concurrence with their mea&s;ures. All hope of a pacification was again di&s;pelled. The hou&s;es at We&s;tmin&s;ter impo&s;ed an exci&s;e on wine, beer, and other commodities; and tho&s;e at Oxford followed their example. The&s;e la&s;t publi&s;hed a declaration, explaining the rea&s;ons which had compelled them to leave the parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter. They declared that the Scots had broke the act of pacification: that all his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects of Eng|land and Wales were bound by their allegiance to re&s;i&s;t them: that their abet|tors were traitors and enemies to the &s;tate: that the lords and commons at We&s;tmin&s;ter were guilty of high trea&s;on, for having levied war again&s;t the king; for having counterfeited the great-&s;eal; and con&s;ented to the inva&s;ion of the Scots: that, in the&s;e three in&s;tances, they had betrayed the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by their country, and ought to be pro&s;ecuted as traitors to the king and kingdom. The marquis of Newca&s;tle marched northwards from York, in order to oppo&s;e the Scots, who entered England in January, when the weather was extremely &s;evere; but colonel Bella&s;is being defeated at Selby, by Sir Tho|mas Fairfax, the marquis was obliged to return and &s;ecure York, while Fairfax marched into Che&s;hire.</P>

<P>The marquis of Ormond being created lord lieutenant of Ireland, &s;ent over a good body of foot to Che&s;ter, where joining the lord Byron, they re|duced &s;everal places, and defeated a detachment of the parliamentarians at Mid|dlewich. The fugitives retired to Nantwich, and the victors undertook the &s;iege of that place; but their good fortune was of &s;hort duration. Sir Thomas Fairfax joining Sir William Brereton, marching to the relief of the be&s;ieged, charged them &s;uddenly, at a time when they were divided by a rivulet &s;welled by exce&s;&s;ive rain: the garri&s;on making a &s;ally at the &s;ame time, the be&s;iegers were totally routed; and lord Byron e&s;caped with the hor&s;e to Che&s;ter. On this occa&s;ion the celebrated colonel Monk was taken, and committed pri&s;oner to the Tower; but he afterwards engaged in the &s;ervice of the parliament. The earl of Montro&s;e, in a vi&s;it to the king at Oxford, had impeached the conduct of duke Hamilton in &s;uch a manner, that his maje&s;ty was convinced of that nobleman's having betrayed his intere&s;t; and when the duke, with his brother the earl of Lanerk, came to court from Scotland at this juncture, they were put under an arre&s;t by the king's order: Lanerk e&s;caped to London; but, the duke was com|mitted pri&s;oner to Bri&s;tol, and afterwards removed to the ca&s;tle of Pendennis in Cornwall. About this time, the two hou&s;es were deprived of their corner-&s;tone, in the death of John Pym, who had in a great mea&s;ure influenced all their coun&s;els, and was a man of exten&s;ive parts, and indefatigable indu&s;try. The prince elector palatine, who had retired from England in the beginning of the civil war, now arrived in London, and was care&s;&s;ed by the parliament. White|hall was a&s;&s;igned to him for his lodgings. The two hou&s;es i&s;&s;ued an order for paying the pen&s;ion of twelve thou&s;and pounds, which had been formerly granted

<P>Mean while, the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on did not interrupt the opera|tions<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1644.</NOTE> of war. As the marquis of Newca&s;tle retired, the Scots advanced farther into the kingdom. They &s;ummoned the town of Newca&s;tle to &s;urrender, but the garri|&s;on refu&s;ing to &s;ubmit, they pa&s;&s;ed the Tyne; and being joined by the lord Fair|fax at Tadca&s;ter, the two generals re&s;olved to undertake the &s;iege of York, to which the marquis had retired. As it was a city of a large extent, they would not proceed in form, until they &s;hould be reinforced by the troops under the earl of Manche&s;ter, who commanded in the a&s;&s;ociated counties; and in the mean time, they formed a blockade on one &s;ide only. The town of Newark in Nottingham&s;hire, garri&s;oned by the king's troops, being be&s;ieged by lord Wil|loughby and Sir John Meldrum, at the head of five thou&s;and men, the king de|tached prince Rupert with a body of forces to &s;uccour the place. When he ap|proached the town, Meldrum, who commanded in the ab&s;ence of Willoughby, drew up his army in order of battle; and an action en&s;uing, both &s;ides fought with great ob&s;tinacy till night, when Meldrum attempted to retire by a bridge where he had po&s;ted a &s;trong guard, to &s;ecure his retreat. This, however, he found occupied by the royali&s;ts; &s;o that he was &s;urrounded on all hands, and next day obliged to capitulate. The prince agreed, that the officers and troopers &s;hould retire with their hor&s;es, and the infantry with their &s;words: but Meldrum was obliged to deliver up all his other arms, artillery, and ammunition.</P>

<P>After this &s;ignal victory, prince Rupert marched to the relief of the counte&s;s of Derby, who was be&s;ieged in her hou&s;e of Latham in Lanca&s;hire, by a body of two thou&s;and parliamentarians. She had defended her&s;elf with incredi|ble courage for two months; and now the be&s;iegers abandoning their enterprize, part of them reinforced the garri&s;on of Bolton, which the prince afterwards took by a&s;&s;ault. Then he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Liverpool, where he re|ceived a letter from the king, commanding him to relieve York, and give battle to the enemy. By this time, the earl of Leven and lord Fairfax were joined by the earl of Manche&s;ter, with a good body of infantry; and the &s;iege of York was begun. The marquis of Newca&s;tle made a vigorous defence; and about the beginning of July, prince Rupert approached at the head of an army little inferior in number to the be&s;iegers. They forthwith abandoned their enterprize, and took po&s;t on Mar&s;ton-Moor, while the prince entered York in triumph. He there, in a conference with the marquis, propo&s;ed to give battle to the enemy, and payed no regard to the remon&s;trances of that nobleman, who a&s;&s;ured him, that the Scots and Engli&s;h being at variance, would &s;eparate in a few days, of their own accord; and that he expected a reinforcement of five thou|&s;and men from the North. The prince, on this occa&s;ion, demeaned him&s;elf in &s;uch an imperious manner as &s;hocked and incen&s;ed the marquis, who&s;e birth and &s;ervices intitled him to the utmo&s;t re&s;pect. When the prince ordered the troops to be in readine&s;s to engage next day, the marquis told him, he &s;hould not he&s;itate in obeying his maje&s;ty's nephew; but that, for his own part, he would &s;erve as a volunteer in the battle. On the third day of July the prince advanced again&s;t the enemy; and, about two in the afternoon both armies were drawn up in order of battle. But as there was a ditch between them, &s;ome time elap&s;ed before the action began. The prince appeared at the head of his left wing, con&s;i&s;ting of five thou&s;and hor&s;e; the right was commanded
<PB N="300" REF="3020">
by Sir Charles Lucas and Colonel Urrey; while the main body was directed by general Goring. Sir Thomas Fairfax commanded the right wing of the enemy, con&s;i&s;ting of all their cavalry, joined by three regiments of Scotti&s;h hor&s;e; the left was under the direction of the earl of Manche&s;ter and lieutenant|general Cromwell; lord Fairfax took po&s;t with a body of re&s;erve, con&s;i&s;ting of his infantry, reinforced with a brigade of the Scotti&s;h foot; and the main body was commanded by the earl of Leven. Prince Rupert charged the right wing of the enemy with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that they were totally routed; and the three generals of the parliament quitting the field, fled towards Cawood ca&s;tle. But the battle was re&s;tored by the valour and conduct of Oliver Cromwell, who, at the head of their left wing, engaged the right of the royali&s;ts, in which the marquis of New$&s;tle acted as a volunteer. They fought on both &s;ides with in|credible fury for &s;ome time; but at length the king's forces were totally de|feated: and when his left wing, which had been victorious, returned from the pur&s;$it, Cromwell attacked it with &s;uch intrepidity before it could be reduced into order, that it was entirely broken and di&s;per&s;ed; &s;o that the parliament<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> obtained a compleat victory. The prince lost &s;ix thou&s;and men, one half of whom fell in battle, together with all his artillery, baggage, and ammunition. He was &s;o much chagrined and confounded at this rever&s;e of fortune, that in|stead of retiring into York, until he &s;hould receive further orders from his ma|je&s;ty, he retreated to Shrop&s;hire with the wreck of his army, while the marquis of Newca&s;tle, di&s;gu&s;ted by his imperious deportment, embarked at Scarborough for the continent, where he remained till the re&s;toration. He was a nobleman of a mo&s;t dignified character; a liberal and munificent patron of the ingenious arts, of un&s;haken loyalty, invincible courage, and exten&s;ive influence; &s;o that the royal cau&s;e &s;u&s;tained an irreparable lo&s;s in his retreat. Immediately after the battle of Mar&s;ton-Moor, the three generals returned to the &s;iege of York, which in a few days was &s;urrendered by Sir Thomas Glenham the governor, who found him&s;elf unable to hold out for any length of time, and de&s;paired of relief. The lord Fairfax took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city; the earl of Manche&s;ter marched back towards the a&s;&s;ociated counties; and the Scotti&s;h army returned to the North, in order to join the earl of Calendar on his march from Scotland with a &s;trong reinforcement. When this junction was effected, they undertook the &s;iege of Newca&s;tle, which they carried by a&s;&s;ault.</P>

<P>The parliament had made extraordinary preparations for this cam|paign. Be&s;ides the armies of Fairfax and Manche&s;ter they had levied ten thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot to be under the command of E&s;&s;ex; and ordered the a&s;&s;ociated counties of Kent, Surry, Su&s;&s;ex, and Hants, to maintain &s;ix thou&s;and under the command of Sir William Waller, whom they intended to oppo&s;e to prince Maurice in the We&s;t, where he bore down all oppo&s;ition. The king, in order to baffle their de&s;ign, detached lord Hopton towards Su&s;&s;ex, and Waller faced him at Farnham: but, after &s;ome &s;light &s;kirmi&s;hes, this general withdrew his troops into the place, and repaired to London, that he might re|present to the two houses the nece&s;&s;ity of a reinforcement. He was accordingly &s;upplied with a body of the city-militia, and E&s;&s;ex was ordered to accommodate him with a thou&s;and hor&s;e, under the command of Sir William Balfour. Wal|ler, thus reinforced, retook the ca&s;tle of Arundel, which Hopton had reduced<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> in his ab&s;ence; and this la&s;t general, having received a &s;upply of men from his maje&s;ty, re&s;olved to give the enemy battle. The two armies met near Alres|ford,
<PB N="301" REF="3030">
on the twenty-ninth day of March. The king's hor&s;e were routed by Sir William Balfour, and the infantry was &s;everely handled: neverthele&s;s the action continued till night, when lord Hopton retired with his artillery and ammunition towards Reading, and left Waller in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field; from whence he marched to Winche&s;ter, which he plundered, though he could not reduce the ca&s;tle.</P>

<P>The two hou&s;es, elated by this advantage, re&s;olved to fini&s;h the war at once, by undertaking the &s;iege of Oxford, where the king re&s;ided; and for this &s;ervice they de&s;tined the armies of E&s;&s;ex and Waller. The king, &s;u&s;|pecting their de&s;ign, withdrew his garri&s;on from Reading, after having di&s;|mantled the place, and a&s;&s;embled an army amounting to twelve thou&s;and men, part of which he po&s;ted at Abingdon, in order to check the progre&s;s of the enemy. E&s;&s;ex and Waller began their march apart; the fir&s;t at the head of twelve thou&s;and foot and three thou&s;and cavalry: the other, with &s;even thou|&s;and infantry, and fifteen hundred dragoons. At the approach of E&s;&s;ex the king's officer abandoned the place, of which the other took immediate po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; while his maje&s;ty endeavoured to defend the banks of the I&s;is and the Cherwell, which however they found means to pa&s;s in &s;pite of all his endea|vours. They thought they had now entangled their &s;overeign in the toil; but he e&s;caped in the night with a &s;mall body of hor&s;e, at the head of which he and the prince arrived in &s;afety at Worce&s;ter. He had already prorogued his par|liament at Oxford, and the queen had retired to Exeter, very far advanced in her pregnancy. There &s;he was delivered of the prince&s;s Henrietta; and when E&s;&s;ex advanced into the we&s;tern counties, &s;he demanded a &s;afe-conduct for Bri&s;|tol, which he refu&s;ed. Then &s;he retired to Cornwall, where &s;he embarked for France, under convoy of a &s;hip of war &s;ent thither by the prince of Orange. The generals of the parliament were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed when they under&s;tood the king had e&s;caped from Oxford. The two hou&s;es had ordered E&s;&s;ex to fol|low his maje&s;ty, in ca&s;e he &s;hould retire from that city; and Waller was com|manded to manage their intere&s;t in the We&s;t. The earl, however, marched into the we&s;tern counties, contrary to their di&s;po&s;ition; and he had advanced as far as Sali&s;bury, when he received an order from the parliament, commanding him to return and pur&s;ue the king, and leave the we&s;tern expedition to Waller. In&s;tead of obeying this mandate, he wrote a letter to the committee of war, explaining his conduct, and &s;ub&s;cribed him&s;elf <Q>&startq;their innocent, though &s;u&s;|pected &s;ervant.&endq;</Q> They did not think proper to exa&s;perate him at &s;uch a juncture, and he pro&s;ecuted his march into Devon&s;hire. Prince Maurice rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Lyme, and retired to Exeter. Dorche&s;ter, Weymouth, and Tiverton &s;urrendered to the earl, and he was admitted into Barn&s;taple, where finding one Howard, an officer in the king's army, who had de&s;erted from the &s;ervice of the parliament, he ordered him to be executed by martial law. Prince Maurice retaliated this in&s;tance of &s;everity upon one Turpin, ma&s;ter of a &s;hip, who had been formerly condemned for carrying arms again&s;t his &s;o|vereign; though the execution of the &s;entence had been hitherto re&s;pited. The two hou&s;es, incen&s;ed at the prince's pre&s;umption, ordered judge Glanville to be pro&s;ecuted as guilty of high trea&s;on, for having been concerned in condemning Turpin. This judge had declared for the king in the beginning of the civil war; but, in the &s;equel, abandoned the cau&s;e of his &s;overeign. Fourteen clo|thiers
<PB N="302" REF="3040">
were hanged at Woodhou&s;e by the king's party; and the parliamen|tarians executed eight Iri&s;h pri&s;oners, who had been taken in a &s;kirmi&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>The king arrived at Worce&s;ter on the &s;ixth day of June; and, in order to deceive the vigilance of Waller, who had followed him with &s;urpri&s;ing expedition, he made a feigned march towards Shrew&s;bury, as if he had intended to join prince Rupert before the battle of Mar&s;ton-Moor. Waller, believing this was really his intention, made a ha&s;ty march, and took po&s;t between him and Shrew&s;bury: then the king wheeled off &s;uddenly, and took the route to Oxford, in the neighbourhood of which he was joined by the re&s;t of his army. After this junction he marched to Buckingham&s;hire, in order to give battle to the enemy. Waller approached with the &s;ame de&s;ign; and the two armies appeared on oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the river Cherwell, on the twenty-ninth day of June. The king, with a view to draw Waller from the advantageous ground of which he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, pretended to begin his march for Northampton&s;hire, leaving a &s;trong guard at the bridge of Cropredy, to di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age with the foe. Receiving intelligence that a large detachment of the enemy was within a mile of his van, he ordered it to double its pace, in hope of inter|cepting the whole body: Waller no &s;ooner perceived that there was a great di&s;tance between his van and his rear, than he ordered a large detachment to ford the river; while he him&s;elf, with fifteen hundred hor&s;e, a thou&s;and foot, and eleven pieces of cannon, attacked and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the bridge of Cropredy. Then pa&s;&s;ing with his whole forces, he fell upon the king's rear, but was repul&s;ed by the gallantry of the earl of Cleveland, who routed his hor&s;e, took part of his artillery, and compelled him to repa&s;s the river with precipitation. The king attacked the bridge and ford in his turn: the la&s;t he gained; but his attempt upon the bridge was ineffectual. Next day, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that Waller's &s;oldiers would lay down their arms upon an a&s;&s;urance of pardon, the king &s;ent a trumpeter to demand a &s;afe-conduct for a gentleman with a gracious me&s;&s;age from his maje&s;ty: but Waller an&s;wered, that he had no power to receive any &s;uch me&s;&s;age without the con&s;ent of parliament, to<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$$$worth.</NOTE> which the king might make his application.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="44" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>After the two armies had faced one another for two days, they re|tired by different routes. Waller employed him&s;elf in recruiting his army, which had &s;u&s;tained great lo&s;s in the action; and the king re&s;olved to direct his march to the we&s;tern counties, in order to join prince Maurice, and give battle to the earl of E&s;&s;ex. By ea&s;y marches he arrived at Bath, where he re|ceived the melancholy account of the battle at Mar&s;ton-Moor. How mortified &s;oever he mu&s;t have been by this intelligence, he bore his fate with &s;urpri&s;ing fortitude, and &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution to execute the &s;cheme he had pro|jected. E&s;&s;ex, being appri&s;ed of his de&s;ign, propo&s;ed to meet him half way, and hazard an engagement, if he &s;hould find a favourable opportunity: but he was diverted from this re&s;olution by the lord Roberts, a major-general in his army, who, being a Corni&s;h man, pre&s;&s;ed him to proceed in his route to Cornwal, where he a&s;&s;ured him the inhabitants would immediately declare for the parliament: the earl accordingly entered that county on the twenty-&s;ixth day of July. On that very day the king arrived at Exeter, from whence he fol|lowed E&s;&s;ex towards Launce&s;ton and Bodmin; where that nobleman, finding him&s;elf di&s;app inted in his hope, wrote to the two hou&s;es, demanding that an
<PB N="303" REF="3050">
army &s;hould be &s;ent immediately to make a diver&s;ion in his favour. Waller being both unable and unwilling to undertake this expedition, colonel Middleton was detached on that &s;ervice, at the head of five and twenty hundred hor&s;e. The king, con&s;cious of the &s;traights to which he had reduced the enemy, wrote a letter with his own hand to E&s;&s;ex, exhorting him to u&s;e his influence for pro|curing peace to his country. Prince Maurice and the earl of Brentford wrote to him on the &s;ame &s;ubject; and he received a letter, &s;igned by all the general officers of the king's army, propo&s;ing a treaty; and prote&s;ting they would main|tain with their lives and fortunes the conditions to which his maje&s;ty &s;hould agree. To the&s;e addre&s;&s;es he replied, that the be&s;t thing the king could do would be to return to his parliament. About this time lord Wilmot, who had for &s;ome time fomented a &s;pirit of mutiny among the troops, and even given E&s;&s;ex to under&s;tand, that the officers would compel the king to conclude an equitable peace, was arre&s;ted, and deprived of his employment, which the king be&s;towed on lord Goring, his rival in wit, good fellow&s;hip, and reputation. Wilmot was afterwards permitted to quit the kingdom. The earl of E&s;&s;ex was now reduced to &s;uch &s;traights for want of provi&s;ion, that the king, being rein|forced by Sir Richard Greenvill, re&s;olved to reduce him without hazarding a battle. He accordingly rai&s;ed a fort upon the bank of the river by which he had been &s;upplied, and hemmed him in on all &s;ides, &s;o as to intercept all his con|voys. In this emergency the earl ordered Sir William Balfour to force his pa&s;&s;age through the king's quarters, at the head of the cavalry; and this &s;ervice was &s;ucce&s;sfully performed, under cover of a very dark night. Then E&s;&s;ex &s;ent a trumpet to demand a parley of the king; but, before the me&s;&s;enger returned, he embarked with &s;ome officers in a ve&s;&s;el at Foy, and was conveyed to Ply|mouth, leaving major-general Skippon to make the be&s;t terms he could obtain for the infantry. A conference was opened by &s;ome officers of each army, who agreed that Skippon &s;hould deliver up all his artillery, arms, and ammu|nition: That the officers &s;hould retain their &s;words and pi&s;tols, and march out with drums beating and colours flying: That they &s;hould be conducted, at their choice, to Li&s;tithiel, Foy, Pool, Warham, or Southampton; and that the men &s;hould not be importuned to enli&s;t in the king's &s;ervice. E&s;&s;ex, at his return to London, was treated with great civility by the two hou&s;es, not|with&s;tanding the cau&s;e they had to complain of his conduct. His &s;oldiers were immediately furni&s;hed with new arms; and his forces recruited. The earl of Manche&s;ter and colonel Middleton were ordered to reinforce his army; and &s;o far were they from being di&s;pirited by this di&s;a&s;ter, that they paid no attention to a me&s;&s;age received from the king, propo&s;ing a treaty for peace.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XLV.</HEAD>
<P>After an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon Plymouth, his maje&s;ty left it blockaded by Sir Richard Greenvill, and marching to Chard in Somer&s;et&s;hire, publi&s;hed a proclamation, repre&s;enting, That his offers of peace had been re|jected by the two hou&s;es; &s;ignifying his re&s;olution to approach London, and commanding the inhabitants of the country through which he &s;hould march, to take up arms and join his forces. This expedient produced very little effect in his favour. His army, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing, was dimini&s;hed one half &s;ince he &s;et out on his we&s;tern expedition. His &s;oldiers were de&s;titute of cloath|ing, nece&s;&s;aries, and pay; and the hor&s;e were di&s;gu&s;ted at the di&s;grace of Wil|mot, who had been very popular among the cavalry. The king was &s;o long
<PB N="304" REF="3060">
retarded in remedying the&s;e inconveniencies, that he found it impracticable to execute his de&s;ign, and re&s;olved to return to Oxford. Even this &s;cheme was attended with many difficulties. Sir William Waller was po&s;ted at Andover. The earl of E&s;&s;ex being recruited and reinforced, began his march towards the &s;ame place; and the earl of Manche&s;ter was at hand to join the other two ge|nerals. In vain the king attempted to prevent their junction, which was ef|fected at Reading on the twenty-fir&s;t day of October. He then detached the earl of Northampton with three regiments of hor&s;e, to relieve Banbury-ca&s;tle, be&s;ieged by colonel John Fiennes, with the forces of Northampton&s;hire, War|wick, and Coventry; while he him&s;elf marched to Donnington ca&s;tle, in the neighbourhood of Newbury, a fortre&s;s which had been long blocked up and be&s;ieged by the parliament's forces. Having thrown &s;uccours into the place, and knighted the governor for his gallant defence, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New|bury, where he entrenched him&s;elf, while the enemy marched again&s;t him from Reading, with a great &s;uperiority in number of troops. On the twenty|&s;eventh day of October, they attacked his intrenchments in two different parts; and the action was maintained with great violence from four o'clock in the afternoon till night, when the a&s;&s;ailants forced the lines in one place, and took &s;everal pieces of cannon; but the darkne&s;s prevented them from making u&s;e of that advantage. On the other &s;ide, they had been repul&s;ed with con&s;ider|able lo&s;s: neverthele&s;s, the king thought proper to retire in the night to Wal|lingford, leaving his artillery and baggage in the ca&s;tle of Donnington, which the earl of Manche&s;ter next day &s;ummoned to &s;urrender. Though the go|vernor refu&s;ed to capitulate, they took no &s;tep towards the reduction of the place, but remained inactive at Newbury, where former animo&s;ities between their generals began to revive with redoubled violence. The king retired unmole&s;ted to Oxford, where, being joined by prince Rupert with the northern hor&s;e, as well as by the earl of Northampton, and reinforced with draughts from different garri&s;ons, he found him&s;elf at the head of eleven thou|&s;and men, with whom he marched back to Donnington, and drew up his army in order of battle, between that ca&s;tle and the town of Newbury. The enemy likewi&s;e appeared in battalia; but they did not think proper to attack<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon.

As they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be influenced by the king's &s;on|in-law the prince of Orange, the two hou&s;es eluded the offer, on pretence that they could take no &s;tep of that kind without the concurrence of the Scotti&s;h nation, with which they were united by the covenant. They, by another or|dinance, forbade their officers and &s;oldiers to give quarter to the Iri&s;h who &s;hould be taken in the king's &s;ervice. On the eleventh day of November archbi&s;hop Laud, who had remained a pri&s;oner &s;ince his fir&s;t impeachment, was brought to his trial, and made &s;uch a vigorous defence, that the com|mons fore&s;eeing he could not be convicted by common evidence, declared him
<PB N="305" REF="3070">
guilty by an act of attainder which pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of lords, though not with|out &s;ome oppo&s;ition. He pleaded the king's pardon, which had been con|veyed to him from Oxford; but it was declared null by both hou&s;es $$ing &s;entenced to the death of a common $elon, he petitioned, that, as he was a prie&s;t, a bi&s;hop, a privy coun&s;ellor, and a peer of the realm, he might &s;uffer decapitation; a reque&s;t which the commons granted with difficulty. On the tenth day of January, this aged prelate was brought to the &s;caffold, where he harrangued the &s;pectators with great fortitude$ He declared him&s;elf innocent of any de&s;ign to &s;ubvert the laws of the realm, or to e&s;tabli&s;h popery. He prote&s;ted he had never been an enemy to parliaments, though he could not applaud &s;ome of their proceedings. He forgave all his enemies; prayed that God would direct the parliament for the good of the nation; and &s;ubmitted his neck to the executioner, who with one &s;troke &s;evered his head from his body.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitelock.</NOTE> Thus fell the famous archbi&s;hop Laud, a prelate of uncommon learning, piety, and virtue, which were clouded with &s;ome unhappy prejudices that proved per|nicious to his country.

<P>This was a bad omen for the treaty which was then in agitation between the king and parliament. Immediately after his maje&s;ty's return to Oxford from Newbury, the two hou&s;es demanded and obtained a &s;afe-conduct for their deputies, with propo&s;als of peace, which they had drawn up in the &s;ummer. The king having heard them read, demanded, in his turn, a &s;afe|conduct for the duke of Richmond and the earl of Southampton, who &s;hould carry an an&s;wer to the two hou&s;es: but this reque&s;t they would not grant, un|til he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the two hou&s;es of the Engli&s;h parliament a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and to the commi&s;&s;ioners of Scotland. On this occa&s;ion Charles had recour&s;e to a &s;ubterfuge which does no great honour to his &s;incerity. He entered a &s;ecret prote&s;t in the council-books, importing, that though he had denominated them the parliament, he did not acknowlege them as &s;uch. By his deputies he propo&s;ed that commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be appointed on each &s;ide, to meet at an indifferent place, and treat of a pacification. After &s;ome di&s;putes, they agreed that the conferences &s;hould be opened at Uxbridge, on the thirtieth of January, and continue twenty days; and that the propo&s;itions &s;hould be reduced to the three articles of religion, the militia, and Ireland. The king's commi&s;&s;ioners were the duke of Richmond, the marquis of Hertford, the earls of Southampton, King&s;ton, and Chiche&s;ter; and eleven commons, among whom was Sir Edward Hyde chancellor of the exchequer, and afterwards earl of Clarendon. The two hou&s;es appointed twelve deputies, at the head of whom were the earls of Northumberland, Pembroke, Sali&s;bury, and Denbigh; and the chief of the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners were the earl of Loudon chancellor of that kingdom, and the marquis of Argyle. The propo&s;itions offered by the two hou&s;es were no other than the mo&s;t &s;evere conditions they could have impo&s;ed upon a prince whom they intended to &s;trip of all the power, and in|deed of all the en&s;igns of royalty. In a word, they demanded that the
<PB N="306" REF="3080">
hierarchy &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, and pre&s;byteriani&s;m e&s;tabli&s;hed in both king|doms: That the king &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe the covenant; abandon his be&s;t friends as traitors; give up the militia, and even his own children to the direction of the two hou&s;es, which engro&s;&s;ed the whole &s;overeign authority. Though no peace was to be expected from &s;uch propo&s;als, the king's commi&s;&s;ioners, in the cour&s;e of the conferences, agreed, That every per&s;on &s;hould enjoy liberty of con|&s;cience touching the ceremonies of the church: That no bi&s;hop &s;hould exerci&s;e any &s;ort of juri&s;diction: That no per&s;on &s;hould be admitted into holy orders without the con&s;ent of the pre&s;bytery: That epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, with re&s;pect to marriages and wills, &s;hould be regulated by the king and the two hou&s;es: That proper laws &s;hould be enacted for the regulations of epi&s;copal vi&s;its, the expence of eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;uits, frivolous excommunications, and other abu&s;es of the &s;piritual courts: That the militia &s;hould be put into the hands of twenty commi&s;&s;ioners, one half to be named by the king, and the other by the two hou&s;es: and, That the commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould la&s;t for three years. The&s;e conce&s;|&s;ions were not deemed &s;atisfactory by the two hou&s;es. Nothing material was propo&s;ed, relating to the affairs of Ireland; and the twenty days being expired, the conferences broke up, without having produced any pro&s;pect of accommo|dation.</P>

<P>This mi&s;carriage of the treaty was extremely agreeable to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth. Whitlock.</NOTE> independent party, which now began to di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf from the pre&s;byterians, with whom it had hitherto concurred in aba&s;ing the royal authority: in every other circum&s;tance their views were quite different. The pre&s;byterians &s;ought to humble and re&s;train the prerogative; the independents to aboli&s;h monarchy, and introduce a democracy. The pre&s;byterians rejected the hierarchy; the in|dependents renounced all forms of church government. They even condemned the ordination of mini&s;ters, allowing all per&s;ons, without exception, to preach, teach, and expound the &s;criptures, according to the talents they had received from God and nature. This &s;ect was compo&s;ed of &s;uch fanatics as gave a loo&s;e to the wilde&s;t reveries of enthu&s;ia&s;m. It was headed by Vane, Cromwell, Tate, and Ha&s;$erig, who found it the be&s;t engine for effecting their purpo&s;e of overturn|ing the con&s;titution in church and &s;tate. The&s;e now began to practi&s;e every art of acquiring popularity. They employed emi&s;&s;aries among the people, to magnify the errors which had been committed &s;ince the commencement of the war, both in the civil and military admini&s;tration; to in&s;inuate that all &s;uch mi&s;conduct proceeded from the intere&s;ted views of individuals, who found their account in the troubles of the nation: and that &s;ome of the generals had purpo&s;ely neglected opportunities of fighting to advantage, dreading nothing &s;o much as a termination of the war. Cromwell had publicly accu&s;ed the earl of Manche&s;ter of having mi&s;behaved from the&s;e motives, in the la&s;t battle of Newbury. The earl recriminated upon Cromwell, by declaring that in a conference with this officer, he &s;aid, that if Manche&s;ter would &s;tick firm to hone&s;t men, $e would &s;oon find him&s;elf at the head of an army, that &s;hould give law both to king and parliament. This declaration alarmed the two hou&s;es, and in a conference at E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e, it was deliberated whether or not Cromwell &s;hould be a$re&s;ted; but this &s;tep was po&s;tponed to another opportunity. Mean while Ol$ver and his a&s;&s;ociates ha&s;tened the execution of the &s;cheme they had projected for new|modelling the army. They propo&s;ed that the troops &s;hould be formed into new
<PB N="307" REF="3090">
regiments; and that members of parliament &s;hould be excluded from all offices civil and military.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XLIX.</HEAD>
<P>The hou&s;e of commons having re&s;olved it&s;elf into a grand com|mittee, to examine the &s;tate of the nation, Cromwell &s;tood up, &s;aying, now was the time to &s;peak, or be &s;ilent for ever. He affirmed, that the name of parlia|ment would become odious to the people, unle&s;s they &s;hould act with more vigour in the pro&s;ecution of the war, which &s;ome members were accu&s;ed of pro|tracting for their own intere&s;t; and he gave it as his opinion, that every mem|ber &s;hould re&s;ign the office he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as a mark of his di&s;intere&s;ted regard for the welfare of the nation. He was &s;econded by &s;ome of his confederates, who &s;poke in general terms; at length, Tate and Vane propo&s;ed an ordinance for ex|cluding members from all offices what&s;oever. A committee was appointed to prepare it, together with another for new-modelling the army. A fa&s;t was pro|claimed for imploring the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God on their endeavours. The pulpits rang with invectives again&s;t tho&s;e members of parliament, who engro&s;&s;ing pro|fitable employments in the government and the army, grew rich by the mi&s;|fortunes of their country. On the nineteenth day of December, the &s;elf-denying ordinance pa&s;&s;ed the lower hou&s;e; but was rejected by the lords. Neverthele&s;s, the commons voted new regulations for the army, and be&s;towed the command of it upon Sir Thomas Fairfax, with power to chu&s;e his own officers. He ac|cordingly<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1$45.</NOTE> delivered his li&s;t of colonels, in which there was not one member of parliament. The earls of E&s;&s;ex, Denbigh, and Manche&s;ter, finding it impo&s;|&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the popular torrent, re&s;igned their commi&s;&s;ions; and next day the lords pa&s;&s;ed the &s;elf-denying ordinance. The pre&s;byterians were fairly out|witted by the nomination of Fairfax for general. He was of their profe&s;&s;ion, and they imagined he would be true to their intere&s;t; but he was intirely go|verned by the coun&s;els of Cromwell, who di&s;&s;embled his real &s;entiments, and profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a zealous pre&s;byterian. While the new general re&s;ided at Wind&s;or, where he had fixed his head-quarters, &s;uperintending the reformation of his army, the committee of the two kingdoms gave him to under&s;tand, that the king had ordered prince Rupert to join him with two thou&s;and hor&s;e: they therefore directed him to detach a body of cavalry towards Oxford, to prevent this junction; and expre&s;sly ordered him to give the command of this detach|ment to Cromwell, as the time fixed for putting in execution the &s;elf-denying ordinance was not yet arrived. This order was calculated to retain Oliver in the &s;ervice, even after the ordinance &s;hould take place.</P>

<P>During the cour&s;e of the preceding year, the earl of Montro&s;e had &s;ig|nalized him&s;elf in a wonderful &s;eries of victories, over the covenanters. On promi&s;e of being &s;upplied with men by the earl of Antrim from the north of Ireland, he with great difficulty reached the Highlands of Scotland in di&s;gui&s;e. When the Iri&s;h landed, to the number of eleven hundred, he produced the king's commi&s;&s;ion, and a&s;&s;embled about the &s;ame number of Highlanders, well affected to the royal c$u&s;e. Without any regular provi&s;ion of arms or ammu|nition, he attacked and routed lord Elcho at Perth, though he commanded an army of &s;ix thou&s;and men, armed and well di&s;ciplined, one third of which num|ber was &s;lain in the battle and pur&s;uit. Being afterwards joined by the earl of Airly, he routed five and twenty hundred covenanters, headed by the lord Burley at Aberdeen. When &s;urrounded on all hands by the marquis of Argyle, the earl of

Lothian, and other noblemen, with the militi$ of the country, he $luded all their vigilance by the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing retreats, marches, and &s;tratagems. He kept the field in the middle of winter, when the ground was covered with &s;how, ex|po&s;ed to inten&s;e cold, famine, and fatigue: he ravaged the country of Ar|gyle with fire and &s;word: he defeated the troops of the marquis at Innerlochy, with great &s;laughter. The terror of his name di&s;per&s;ed a body of five thou&s;and men, whom the earl of Seaforth had a&s;&s;embled: he took Dundee by a&s;&s;ault, and gave it up to plunder; and retreated above &s;ixty miles, in the face of a &s;uperior enemy, commanded by colonel Urrey, who had by this time de&s;erted the king, and joined the parliamentarians. He defeated this officer in a pitched battle near Inverne&s;s; and Bailie, another &s;oldier of reputation, marching again&s;t him with<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> a fre&s;h army, met with the &s;ame di&s;a&s;ter.

<P>THE parliament's army was by this time new-modelled according to the plan of Cromwell, &s;o as that all members of parliament were excluded; and their adherents re&s;igning their commi&s;&s;ions, the vacant places were filled with independents. The&s;e acted the part of chaplains as well as of officers: in the intervals of military duty, they exerci&s;ed them&s;elves in &s;ermon, prayer, and exhortation. They were &s;eized with exta&s;ies of devotion, and poured forth rhap&s;odies, which they them&s;elves mi&s;took for prophecy and in&s;pi|ration. Thus actuated, they mounted the pulpits, and held forth in a torrent of that &s;ort of eloquence, which though lea&s;t under&s;tood, is the mo&s;t effectual in kindling the blaze of enthu&s;ia&s;m. The common &s;oldiers were infected by this contagion: they were &s;eized with the &s;ame holy fervours: they underwent the operations of grace: they communicated their mutual feelings: they gave utterance to the &s;pirit: they advanced to battle &s;inging p&s;alms, or religious &s;ongs: they fought with the mo&s;t eager zeal, and died in full confidence of ob|taining the crown of martyrdom. It was with a detachment of &s;uch warriors that Cromwell marched from Wind&s;or on the twenty-fourth day of April. In the neghbourhood of I&s;lip, he cut in pieces four regiments of the king's cavalry. Blechington was &s;urrendered to him at the fir&s;t &s;ummons, by colonel Winde|ba$k, who was condemned by a court-martial, and &s;hot for cowardice; but Cromwell was repul&s;ed in his attack upon Farrindon. Taunton being be&s;ieged by Sir Richard Greenvill, the two hou&s;es ordered the general to march to the relief of that place; but when he had advanced as far as Blandford, he received a countermanding order; in con&s;equence of which he returned to Newbury, after<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hw$rth.</NOTE> having detached colonel Weldon with body of hor&s;e and foot, to &s;uccour Taun|ton. At his approach Greenvill rai&s;ed the &s;iege; but being afterwards joined by a reinforcement under Goring, he re&s;umed his operations again&s;t the place, in which the detachment with Weldon was now included.</P>

<P>The king marching to Leice&s;ter, took that city by a&s;&s;ault; and Fairfax followed the &s;ame route, in order to give him battle, the two hou&s;es having, at the de&s;ire of their general, di&s;pen&s;ed with the attendance of Cromwell, who thus pre&s;erved his command in the army, notwith&s;tanding the &s;elf-denying ordinance. Charles being informed that Fairfax was ordered to be&s;iege Oxford, advanc|ed towards Harborough, where he received intelligence that he had aban|doned his de&s;ign upon Oxford; and had been repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s in a&s;&s;aulting the ca&s;tle of Bor&s;tal. The king continued his march, in expectation of being joined by colonel Gerard with two thou&s;and men from Wales, as well as by Goring, at the head of three thou&s;and cavalry. This officer had wrote to $$m from Taunton, giving him hopes of reducing that place, and advi&s;ing him to act upon the defen&s;ive, until he &s;hould join the army: but, the letter fell into the hands of Fairfax, who thus apprized, re&s;olved to hazard an engagement before the junction could be effected. For this purpo&s;e he followed the royali&s;ts; and the king &s;eeing it would be impo&s;&s;ible to reach Leice&s;ter, without expo&s;ing
<PB N="311" REF="3130">
his rear to certain de&s;truction, determined to meet him half way. He accord|ingly marched back; and, on the fourteenth day of June, came in &s;ight of the enemy, who were drawn up in order of battle on a ri&s;ing-ground, in the neigh|bourhood of a village called Na&s;eby. Prince Rupert led the right wing of the royali&s;ts: the left was under the direction of Sir Marmaduke Lang|dale: lord A&s;tley commanded the main body, con&s;i&s;ting of all the infantry: and the king headed the body of re&s;erve. The cavalry on the enemy's right wing was commanded by Cromwell; the left by his &s;on-in-law Ireton: while Fairfax and Skippon conducted the center. Prince Rupert attacked the left wing with his u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity and &s;ucce&s;s: they were broke and pur&s;ued as far as the village; but, the prince in his return mi&s;pent his time, in a fruit|le&s;s attempt to &s;eize their park of artillery. Cromwell, in the mean time, was furiou&s;ly engaged with Sir Marmaduke Langdale, who&s;e hor&s;e were broken after a very ob&s;tinate di&s;pute. The infantry on both &s;ides maintained the conflict with equal valour for &s;ome time; but, in &s;pite of the efforts of Fairfax and Skippon, their battalions began to give way, when Cromwell returned, and charged the king's infantry in flank, with &s;uch vigour as they could not re&s;i&s;t; &s;o that they were immediately routed and di&s;per&s;ed. By this time prince Ru|pert had rejoined the king, and the &s;mall body of re&s;erve; but his troops, tho' victorious, could not be brought to a &s;econd charge. They were at all times licentious and ungovernable: but here they were intimidated; for, Fairfax, Skippon, and Cromwell, had by this time reduced their forces into order of bat|tle; and &s;tood ready either for attack or defence. The king would have charged them, at the head of his re&s;erve, even before Rupert returned, had not he been prevented by an uncommon accident. The Scotti&s;h earl of Carnwath, who rode by his maje&s;ty's &s;ide, &s;eizing the bridle of his hor&s;e, turned him round, &s;aying with a loud oath, "Will you go upon your death in an in&s;tant?" The troops &s;eeing this motion, wheeled to the right, and rode off in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that they could not be rallied during the whole action.

<P>After the battle, he and prince Rupert retired with the hor&s;e to A&s;hby de la Zouche, from whence they proceeded to Hereford, where they parted. The prince repaired to Bri&s;tel, to put that place in a po&s;ture of defence; while the king continued his route to Wales, in hope of being able to a&s;&s;emble an army in that exhau&s;ted country. Fairfax advanced to Leice&s;ter, which &s;urren|dered upon capitulation. Then he marched into the We&s;t, where he rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Taunton, and totally defeated lord Goring at Lamport. This $word$ was attended with the reduction of Bridgewater, Sh$rburn, and Bath; after which Fairfax undertook the &s;iege of Bri&s;tol. That place was well &s;upplied with men, provi&s;ions, and ammunition; and every body concluded, from the

known valour of prince Rupert, that it would make a very vigorous defence. He even wrote to the king, that he &s;hould be able to hold out four months, unle&s;s a mutiny &s;hould compel him to &s;urrender. Notwith&s;tanding this pro|mi&s;e, and the general expectation, he offered to capitulate at the fir&s;t &s;ummons; and actually delivered up the place before the be&s;iegers had begun to make their approaches. The unhappy monarch, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of his grief and<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> re&s;entment, ordered his nephew to quit the kingdom, and revoked all his commi&s;&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>Fairfax having &s;ecured Bri&s;tol with a proper garri&s;on, re&s;umed his march to the we&s;tern counties, ordering Cromwell to keep open the communi|cation with London; and detaching colonel Rainborough to be&s;iege Berkeley|ca&s;tle, which was the only place that remained in the king's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion between Glouce&s;ter and Bri&s;tol. Cromwell, in the cour&s;e of this excur&s;ion, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the Devizes, the town and ca&s;tle of Winche&s;ter, and &s;everal other places. Fairfax mean while reduced Tiverton, and blocked up the city of Exeter. Hearing that the prince of Wales had a&s;&s;embled an army in Corn|wal, and was on his march to give him battle, he advanced with great expe|dition to meet his royal highne&s;s, who thought proper to retreat into Cornwal, after part of his cavalry under lord Wentworth had been &s;urpri&s;ed by the enemy. Then Fairfax took Dartmouth by a&s;&s;ault, and returned to the blockade of Exeter. Lord Goring had by this time retired to France; and the prince of Wales be&s;towed the command of his army upon lord Hopton, who re&s;olved to relieve Exeter. General Fairfax being informed of his de&s;ign, left the con|duct of the blockade to Sir Hardre&s;s Waller, and marched towards Torrington, where Hopton lay intrenched. His troops endeavouring to di&s;lodge the par|liamentarians from &s;ome of their po&s;ts in the night, were in&s;en&s;ibly drawn into an engagement, which be ame general, and la&s;ted till morning. The in|trenchments were forced; the infantry on the king's &s;ide were either killed, taken, or di&s;per&s;ed; and lord Hopton retired with the cavalry into Cornwal. Thither he was followed by the victor; and the prince of Wales finding him&s;elf in danger of being taken, embarked on board of a ve&s;&s;el, and was conveyed to the i&s;les of Scilly. Hopton continued &s;till to retire before the army of the parliament, over which he gained &s;ome petty advantages; but at length he was &s;urrounded on all hands at Truro, and obliged to take the benefit of a capitulation. He &s;tipulated that his troops &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and allowed either to cro&s;s the &s;ea or return to their own hou&s;es. All their hor&s;es and arms were delivered to Fairfax, who granted pa&s;&s;ports to tho&s;e who de&s;ired to quit the kingdom, after they had &s;worn that they would never &s;erve again&s;t the parliament. This treaty being executed, the lords Hopton and Colepepper retired to Scilly; &s;o that the king's troops in the we&s;tern counties were entirely di&s;per&s;ed; and Fairfax returned to the &s;iege of Exeter, which &s;urrendered in the month of April.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year, the Scotti&s;h army be&s;ieged Carlile, which &s;urrendered on capitulation in the month of June. About the latter end of July, they inve&s;ted Hereford; but abandoned this enterprize in the beginning of September. The earl of Leven publi&s;hed an apology for his mi&s;carriage, in which he complained that his men were not payed by thepar|liement;  that the two hou&s;es had not performed their promi&s;e, of &s;upplying

him with artillery, and other implements of &s;iege; and that he had been obliged to detach David Le&s;ley with the greater part of his hor&s;e and dra|goons, to oppo&s;e the earl of Montro&s;e in Scotland. They retreated to York|&s;hire, where they received a &s;upply of thirty thou&s;and pounds, and the two hou&s;es ordained that the ea&s;tern a&s;&s;ociated counties &s;hould furni&s;h them with fourteen hundred pounds &s;terling a week, on condition that they would under|take the &s;iege of Newark, which they accordingly inve&s;ted in the month of October.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the unfortunate king underwent a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;eries of dangers, mortifications, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which he bore with uncommon fortitude and dignity. Far from being overwhelmed with de&s;pair, in con&s;e|quence of his defeat at Na&s;eby, he no &s;ooner under&s;tood that Fairfax had marched into the we&s;tern counties, than he advanced from Wales, at the head of his cavalry, amounting to three thou&s;and men, reduced the town of Hun|tington, vi&s;ited Oxford, where he received a &s;mall reinforcement, and then took po&s;t at Cambden, at the time when Bri&s;tol and Hereford were inve&s;ted. The Scots rai&s;ing the &s;iege of this la&s;t place, he entered it with his little army, and there remained till the twentieth day of September. He was now re|duced to &s;uch a melancholy &s;ituation, that he &s;aw no other pro&s;pect of re|trieving his affairs, than that of joining Montro&s;e in Scotland; and this expe|dient he actually embraced. Hearing that a &s;trong body of hor&s;e and dra|goons belonging to the enemy, was po&s;ted, under the command of Pointz, be|tween Hereford and Worce&s;ter, he re&s;olved to take his route through North Wales to Che&s;ter, and from thence pa&s;s through Lanca&s;hire and Cumberland to Scotland. He found the enemy in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the outworks and &s;uburbs of Che&s;ter, which they had &s;urpri&s;ed. He detached Sir Marmaduke Lang|dale over Holt-bridge, in order to fall upon the back of the be&s;iegers early next morning, while he him&s;elf entered the city. Pointz, who had followed the king by ha&s;ty marches, appeared next day, and was charged by Sir Mar|maduke, who compelled him to retire at a greater di&s;tance. The be&s;iegers no &s;ooner perceived him, than they began to evacuate the &s;uburbs, in order to join his troops; and thus reinforced, he attacked the royali&s;ts in his turn. They were overpowered by numbers, and pur&s;ued to the walls of Che&s;ter. Then the earl of Litchfield and lord Gerard, with the king's guards, and the re&s;t of the cavalry, advanced to the charge, and Pointz was obliged to retire: but his mu&s;queteers being drawn up among the narrow lanes and hedges, made &s;uch a fire upon the royali&s;ts, that they were broken, routed, and di&s;per&s;ed, after the gallant earl of Litchfield, and many other gentlemen of reputation, had lo&s;t their lives in the engagement.</P>

<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; VII.</HEAD>
<P>The king retreated with five hundred hor&s;e to Denbigh-ca&s;tle in North Wales, and Pointz hung upon his rear. Being joined by prince Maurice with eight hundred hor&s;e, and &s;ome other reinforcements, he cro&s;&s;ed the river Dee, gained a march upon the enemy, and arrived at Bridgenorth, where, receiving intelligence that Berkley-ca&s;tle and the Devizes had &s;urren|dered to the parliamentarians, he, by the advice of his council, &s;et out for Newark in Nottingham&s;hire, where he had a garri&s;on of two thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot. Though he had already been chagrined with an account of Mon|tro&s;e's total defeat by David Le&s;ley, who &s;uddenly fell upon him before he had
<PB N="314" REF="3160">
proper notice of his approach; it was now confidently reported, that the earl, &s;tre$gth$$ed by a $$inforcement, had attacked and wor&s;ted Le&s;ley in his turn, and marched towards the b$rder with a &s;trong army. This fal&s;e intelli|gence gained &s;uch credit with the king, that he advanced northwards as far as Rotheram, where he was undeceived. There he was certainly informed that Montro&s;e had retreated with his broken forces towards the Highlands; that David Le&s;ley was ma&s;ter of all Lothian; and that the Scotti&s;h army lay be|tween Northallerton and Newca&s;tle. Inexpre&s;&s;ible was the &s;orrow and anxiety that this intelligence produced in the bo&s;om of the king, who forthwith re|&s;olved to return; but, in the mean time, he con&s;tituted lord Digby lieutenant|general of all the forces rai&s;ed, or to be rai&s;ed, on the other &s;ide of Trent; and ordered him and Sir Marmaduke Langdale to proceed with fifteen hundred hor&s;e for Scotland, to join Montro&s;e. This new general began his expedition without delay. He di&s;per&s;ed a thou&s;and foot, rai&s;ed for the parliament, in the neighbourhood of Donca&s;ter; and at Sherbourne attacked colonel Copley, who commanded a body of cavalry. Digby was routed, and fled to Skipton, while his baggage fell into the hands of the enemy; and, among other things, a cabinet of papers, which were publi&s;hed by order of the two hou&s;es. Not|with&s;tanding the check he had received, he proceeded through We&s;tmoreland and Cumberland, as far as Dumfries in Scotland: but receiving no intelli|gence of Montro&s;e, and finding him&s;elf in danger of being &s;urrounded by the covenanters, he embarked with Sir Marmaduke, and the Scotti&s;h earls of Carnwath and Nidde&s;dale, for the i&s;le of Man, from whence they were tran|&s;ported to Ireland.</P>

<P>His maje&s;ty returning to Newark, prince Rupert appeared in his pre&s;ence, de&s;iring he might have an opportunity to ju&s;tify his conduct. The king, who ever loved him with the mo&s;t tender affection, complied with his reque&s;t; admitted of his apology; and, by a declaration, ab&s;olved him of all &s;u&s;picion of di&s;loyalty. The well-affected gentlemen of that country being di&s;&s;atisfied with the conduct of Sir Richard Willis governor of Newark, the king, who was determined upon removing to Oxford, told him he would appoint him captain of his hor&s;e-guards; &s;o that he &s;hould always be in attendance upon his per&s;on; and that he would confer the government of Newark upon lord Bella&s;is. Sir Richard was extremely mortified at this in|timation, and retired to con&s;ult with his friends. While his maje&s;ty &s;at at dinner, he entered the apartment, accompanied by prince Rupert and prince Maurice, lord Gerard, and about twenty officers of the garri&s;on. He &s;aid his di&s;grace was now the public talk of the town. Prince Rupert affirmed, that Sir Richard Willis was no otherwi&s;e faulty than in being his friend. Lord Gerard exclaimed, it was a plot of lord Digby, who was a traitor, and he would prove him to be &s;o. The king, equally &s;urpri&s;ed and incen&s;ed at their intru&s;ion, ro&s;e from the table in di&s;order, de&s;iring Sir Richard Willis would follow him into his bed-chamber. He replied, that he had received a public injury, and expected a public &s;atisfaction. The king could no longer contain his indignation. He a&s;&s;umed &s;uch an air of re&s;entment and authority as he had never manife&s;ted before, and commanded them to begone from his pre|&s;ence, with &s;uch dignity of di&s;plea&s;ure as overwhelmed them with confu&s;ion and di&s;may. They had no &s;ooner quitted the apartment, than he was vi&s;ited
<PB N="315" REF="3170">
by the lords and gentlemen in the town, who comforted him with the mo&s;t dutiful expre&s;&s;ions, and profe&s;&s;ed a very tender &s;en&s;e of the in&s;olent u&s;age he had endured. Lord Bella&s;is was immediately declared governor of the place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon.</NOTE> and began to perform the functions of his office. In the afternoon, the king received a petition, &s;igned by the two princes and their adherents, de&s;iring that Sir Richard Willis might be tried by a court-martial; or, &s;hould this be de|nied, that they and their friends might be furni&s;hed with pa&s;&s;es. The&s;e were immediately expedited; they next day retired to Wyverton, and then to Bel|voir-ca&s;tle; from whence they &s;ent one of their number to the parliament for leave to quit the kingdom; yet they were afterwards pardoned and taken into favour.</P>

<P>Nothing could be more forlorn and de&s;olate than the condition of Charles at this juncture. His faithful coun&s;ellors, and tru&s;ty friends, had either fallen in his cau&s;e, or been obliged to exile them&s;elves from their country. His con&s;ort, the tender partner of his heart, had been obliged to fly for re|fuge to a foreign land. His elde&s;t &s;on now roamed a wretched fugitive among the barren rocks of Scilly; and the re&s;t of his children ran the ri&s;que of falling into the hands of his inveterate enemies. His armies were either &s;laughtered or di&s;per&s;ed; he was abandoned by his ungrateful nephews, whom he had al|ways cheri&s;hed with parental affection; and now he found him&s;elf &s;o encom|pa&s;&s;ed by his adver&s;aries, under Pointz and Ro&s;&s;iter, that it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape, without the interpo&s;ition of a miracle. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e dan|gers, he &s;till pre&s;erved an unclouded judgment, and un&s;haken equanimity. He &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to the governor of Oxford, with orders that the hor&s;e of the garri&s;on &s;hould be between Banbury and Daventry, at an appointed time. He departed from Newark on the third day of November, at eleven o'clock at night, attended by five hundred hor&s;e. At three in the morning they reached B$lvoir-ca&s;tle, where he found Sir Gervas Lucas, the governor, ready with guides to conduct him farther on his way. In pa&s;&s;ing near Burleigh, where the parliament had a garri&s;on, he was mole&s;ted by their hor&s;e, who killed and took &s;ome &s;tragglers. Towards evening he was &s;o fatigued, that he found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome repo&s;e in a village near Northampton. At ten o'clock he continued his march, pa&s;&s;ed Daventry before day, reached Banbury about noon; and there he found the hor&s;e, by whom he was &s;afely conducted to Oxford, after having undergone &s;uch a vici&s;&s;itude of misfortune, danger, and fatigue, as mu&s;t have broken the &s;pirit of any prince not endued<NOTE PLACE="marg">Id.</NOTE> with a very uncommon &s;hare of magnanimity.</P>

<P>He had now lei&s;ure to deliberate upon the means of his own pre&s;erva|tion; but no plau&s;ible &s;cheme occurred to his imagination. In this emergency he had again recour&s;e to the method of negotiation. He entertained &s;ome faint hopes of profiting by the di&s;&s;entions between the pre&s;byterians and inde|pendents; and indeed he built too much on this mi&s;under&s;tanding. He de|manded of the two hou&s;es a &s;afe-conduct for the duke of Richmond, the earl of Southampton, and &s;ome others, whom he intended to &s;end with propo&s;als for an accommodation. Receiving no an&s;wer, he renewed his demand. In a third me&s;&s;age, he offered to treat with them in per&s;on, provided the parlia|ment, the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, the mayor of London, and the generals of their armies, would engage that he &s;hould &s;afely re&s;ide among them for forty
<PB N="316" REF="3180">
days, and return unmole&s;ted to Oxford, Worce&s;ter, or Newark, in ca&s;e the n$g$$ia$ion &s;hould prove i$$$$ectual: and, for their encouragement to treat, he $$$lared him&s;elf ready to &s;ettle the militia in the hands of &s;uch per&s;ons as they &s;hould recomm$nd or approve for that purpo&s;e. The hou&s;es, in an&s;wer to h$s fir&s;t me&s;&s;age, refu&s;ed a &s;afe-conduct for his commi&s;&s;ioners; but pro|mi&s;ed to draw out propo&s;itions and bills, which &s;hould be pre&s;ented to his ma|je&s;ty. To his propo&s;$$ of a per&s;onal treaty they made no an&s;wer. He com|plained of their &s;ilence in repeated me&s;&s;ages. He offered liberty of con&s;cience to nonconformi&s;ts. He propo&s;ed, upon the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the armies, to join the two hou&s;$s, to take mea&s;ures for the payment of the public debt$, and for &s;ettling the affairs of the militia and of Ireland, to the &s;atisfaction of all parti$$. The hou&s;es rejected his propo&s;al, and upbraided him with having &s;hed the blood of his &s;ubjects. He re$uted their a$per$ions, in&s;i&s;ted upon the per&s;onal treaty, and made other conce&s;&s;ions, which plainly indicated his &s;incere de&s;ire of peace. Con&s;idering his deplorable &s;ituation, they could not $oubt his &s;in|cerity: but nothing was farther from their thoughts than an accommodation with their &s;overeign. Their leaders were determined upon a di&s;&s;olution of monarchy. They had reduced their king to extremity, and now they thought it was their turn to impo&s;e conditions. They taxed him with a de&s;ign to make peace with the rebels in Ireland, and employ their troops again&s;t his parlia|ment If he had actually practi&s;ed this expedient for his own pr$&s;ervation, he would have been acquitted by all the unprejudiced part of the world. Per&s;ecuted and hunted down by his own rebellious &s;ubjects, he had a natural right, after more pacific means had proved ineffectual, to call in an army of for$igners to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, how much &s;oever they might have di$$ered from him in articles of faith. This has been the practice of all nations. How much more ju&s;tifiable was he then, in &s;ecuring the aid of his own &s;ubjects, even though he gratified them for this &s;ervice with that liberty of con&s;cience which every human being has a right to enjoy? But Charles ab&s;olutely denied the imputation of having empowered the earl of Glamorgan to conclude a treaty with the Iri&s;h rebels. He owned, in$$ed, he had commi&s;&s;ioned that nobleman to rai&s;e and bring a body of Iri&s;h troops into England: nor did he deny that the marquis of O$mond had powers to fini&s;h by treaty a war which the parliament had negle$$$d to maintain; as the prote&s;tants of Ireland were threatened wish utter ext$rpati$$. Glamorgan exceeded his powers; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> actually conc$$ded a treaty in the king's name: but this was no &s;ooner known, than the earl was arre$ted and impri&s;oned by the marquis of Ormond; and the king d$&s;owned the tran&s;action.</P>

<P>Such was the melancholy &s;ituation of Charles, when the court of France &s;$nt over Montreuil, on pretence of mediating a peace between the king and parliament, though his real intention was to effect a &s;eparat$ accommodation between his maje&s;ty and the Scotti&s;h army. His queen di&s;patched Mr. Da|venant at the &s;$me time, to per&s;uade him to declare for the pre&s;byteri$n party, which was e&s;pou&s;ed by the city of London, in oppo&s;ition to the independents. Montre$$l $$und the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners at London, very well di&s;po&s;ed to treat with his maje&s;ty; but they in&s;i&s;ted upon the abolition of epi&s;copacy, as an indi&s;pen&s;able preliminary, with which the king, from con&s;cientious motives, con&s;ta$$ly r$fu$ed to comply. While the French mini&s;ter made a journey to
<PB N="317" REF="3190">
the Scotti&s;h army before Newark, in hope of finding &s;ome temperament, Fair|fax advanced with his army towards Oxford; &s;o that the king was in the mo&s;t imminent danger of being &s;urrounded. He had ordered the lord A&s;tley to draw from the few garri&s;ons &s;till in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;uch a body of troops as might take the field early in the &s;pring. He accordingly a&s;&s;embled about two thou&s;and, with which he advanced towards Oxford; but the parliamentari|ans, appri&s;ed of his de&s;ign, fell upon him in his march, when his troops were fainting with fatigue. After a very ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, his forces were defeated and di&s;per&s;ed, and he him&s;elf taken pri&s;oner, together with Sir Charles Lucas, and many other officers.</P>

<P>This was the la&s;t effort which the king made to defend him&s;elf by force of arms. He now &s;aw no other po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping the rancour of his adver&s;aries, than that of throwing him&s;elf into the arms of the Scots, who he hoped, would, from re&s;entment to the independent party, which they hated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1646.</NOTE> and affection to their native prince, be prevailed upon to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, or at lea&s;t protect his per&s;on from the rage of his enemies. Such protection their chiefs had &s;everally promi&s;ed, in conferences with Montreuil, though they refu&s;ed to &s;ign any treaty or convention for that purpo&s;e; and this French agent advi&s;ed the king to depend upon their &s;incerity. Charles was be&s;et in &s;uch a manner, that he had no time to he&s;itate; and he thought this was the lea&s;t de&s;perate cour&s;e he could follow. Had any other re&s;ource remained, he would hardly have thrown him&s;elf, without any other a&s;&s;urance, upon the mercy of tho&s;e who were his declared enemies, and acted as auxiliaries to the parliament of Eng|land. Early in the morning of the twenty-&s;eventh day of April, he quitted Oxford in di&s;gui&s;e, attended by John A&s;hburnham, and one Hud&s;on an ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic, who undertook to conduct him through bye-wayes that were little frequented. He &s;pent &s;everal days in travelling from one gentleman's hou&s;e to another, where he was not unknown, though no notice was taken of his per&s;on. He pa&s;&s;ed through St. Alban's, and even came within a few miles of London, as if he had intended to pre&s;ent him&s;elf before the parliament: then he took the road to the Scotti&s;h camp at Newark. His e&s;cape from Oxford was no &s;ooner known in London, than the two hou&s;es i&s;&s;ued an order, denounc|ing the pains of high trea&s;on again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;helter or protect their &s;overeign. When he di&s;covered him&s;elf to the earl of Leven, that general &s;eemed exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed and confounded at his pre&s;ence: neverthele&s;s, he received him with all the marks of re&s;pect and veneration.</P>

<P>An expre&s;s was immediately di&s;patched with an account of this im|portant incident to the two hou&s;es; in which it was immediately re&s;olved, that Fairfax, who had inve&s;ted Oxford, &s;hould relinqui&s;h that enterprize, and march directly to Newark: but this re&s;olution was po&s;tponed, when the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners declared that the king's coming was altogether unexpected by their generals, who would punctually obey the orders of the parliament. The Scots prevailed upon the king to order Bella&s;is governor of Newark to &s;ur|render the place, which was accordingly delivered up; and hearing that Fair|fax had made a motion towards the North, they forthwith retired with his maje&s;ty to Newca&s;tle. There he was excluded from all communication with Montreuil, and A&s;hburnham was obliged to leave the kingdom, otherwi&s;e he

<P>The king &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the two hou&s;es, de&s;iring they would fini&s;h the affair of religion according to the advice of able theologi&s;ts. He con&s;ented to their appointing commi&s;&s;ioners for the militia during &s;even years: he offered to concur with them in &s;ettling the affairs of Ireland; to di&s;mi&s;s his troops, and &s;urrender the places that were &s;till in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He wrote to the city of London, that he was di&s;po&s;ed to &s;atisfy the two hou&s;es in every particular. He afterwards pre&s;&s;ed the parliament to &s;end propo&s;itions; and a&s;ked leave to come and treat with them in per&s;on. The Scots publi&s;hed a declaration, prote&s;ting that they would adhere to the covenant; and that they abhorred all &s;ecret prac|tices tending to produce a mi&s;under&s;tanding between the two kingdoms. They pre&s;ented a petition to the king, be&s;eeching him to labour effectually in the great work of peace, to &s;ub&s;cribe the covenant, regulate religion in conformity with the practice of the be&s;t prote&s;tant churches, and conduct him&s;elf according to the advice of his parliament. The general a&s;&s;embly of the kirk of Scotland wrote to the parliament of England, the city of London, and the eccle&s;ia&s;tical a&s;&s;embly, intreating them to forward the work of reformation according to the tenour of the covenant. The hou&s;e of commons voted that there was no further occa&s;ion for the Scotti&s;h army; and that the commi&s;&s;ioners of that kingdom &s;hould be required to withdraw their forces from England. Then they &s;ent propo&s;als of peace to the king, more &s;evere than tho&s;e upon which they had in&s;i&s;ted at Ux|bridge. They now arrogated to them&s;elves the whole power of the admi|ni&s;tration; and their deputies gave the king to under&s;tand, that they could not &s;tay longer than ten days at Newca&s;tle. He an&s;wered, that though he could not &s;trip him&s;elf of that which he inherited by birth and the laws of the realm, he would con&s;ent to all ju&s;t and rea&s;onable demands for the good of the commonwealth, without paying any regard to his own particular intere&s;t. The earl of Loudon, chancellor of Scotland, exhorted him to comply with the propo&s;als, deriving his arguments from the nece&s;&s;ity of his maje&s;ty's affairs; but, in the article of epi&s;copacy, the king was immoveable.</P>

<P>The deputies of Scotland pre&s;ented a memorial to the upper hou&s;e, offering to withdraw their army from England, upon payment of their arrears. Commi&s;&s;ioners were immediately appointed to examine their accounts. After various di&s;putes they agreed to take four hundred thou&s;and pounds in lieu of all their demands: and this is &s;aid to have been the price for which they &s;old their king to his enemies. That the delivery of this ill-fated prince to the
<PB N="319" REF="3210">
two hou&s;es was a private &s;tipulation in the treaty, is &s;carce to be que&s;tioned: that it was criminal in the Scots, will admit of &s;ome doubt. Had they acted otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t have deviated from all their former maxims, and enga|ged in a dangerous war again&s;t their own confederates, in behalf of a prince whom they had always con&s;idered as their implacable enemy. In protecting their king, they mu&s;t have betrayed their cau&s;e, proved fal&s;e to their tru&s;t, and ruined the work which they had rai&s;ed with &s;uch labour. Their aver&s;ion to the king was in&s;pired by the &s;ugge&s;tions of re&s;entment, intere&s;t, and fanati|ci&s;m: the&s;e are motives hardly to be re&s;i&s;ted. Had they given way to the dictates of genero&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion, they would have gloriou&s;ly atoned for the mi&s;chiefs they had occa&s;ioned: though ruined in the conte&s;t with the king's adver&s;aries, they would have nobly fallen, and their memory would have e&s;caped that reproach by which it is now &s;tigmatized. In the beginning of September, the duke of Hamilton had been removed to St. Michael's mount in Cornwall; and when it &s;urrendered to the parliamentarians, he was relea&s;ed. He now repaired from London to Newca&s;tle with the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, and importuned the king to clo&s;e with the propo&s;itions of the two hou&s;es. His maje&s;ty &s;aid, all he de&s;ired was a hearing, and that was denied. He did not ab&s;olutely reject the propo&s;als, but wi&s;hed for an opportunity to explain his &s;entiments. He propo&s;ed that the hierarchy &s;hould be confined to &s;ome particular dioce&s;es, &s;uch as Oxford, Winche&s;ter, Bri&s;tol, Bath, and Exeter; and that the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed in all other parts of the kingdom: he hoped the clergy would not pre&s;s him to act again&s;t his con&s;cience, until he &s;hould be better informed.</P>

<P>On the eighteenth day of September, the two hou&s;es appointed a committee to confer with the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners about di&s;po&s;ing of the king's per&s;on. The earl of Loudon alledged, that each kingdom had an equal right to this di&s;po&s;al, as he was equally &s;overeign of both kingdoms; and as the intere&s;t of both nations was united by the covenant. The Engli&s;h committee replied, that they had the &s;ole right to di&s;po&s;e of his per&s;on, becau&s;e he was then in England, and the Scotti&s;h army acted as auxiliaries to that nation. This point was debated in &s;everal conferences; and the Scots printed a relation of what they had advanced to prove that Scotland and England were equally intere&s;ted in the per&s;on of the king, and had an equal title to di&s;po&s;e of him and his affairs. The commons ordered the copies of this relation to be &s;eized, and the printer was impri&s;oned. Then they pubii&s;hed a long an&s;wer, which they &s;ent to the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, who refu&s;ed to receive it, on pretence that it was not offered in the name of either hou&s;e of parliament. On the &s;ixteenth day of December, the parliament of Scotland, re&s;olved that their commi&s;&s;ioners at London &s;hould demand of the two hou&s;es, in their name, that the king might return to London with honour and &s;afety; and, at the &s;ame time, declare that the Scotti&s;h parliament was re&s;olved to maintain the monarchy in the per&s;on of the king, together with his ju&s;t rights to the crown of England. Next day, however, a remon&s;trance was pre&s;ented to them by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the general a&s;&s;embly, repre&s;enting the enor|mous &s;in of taking any &s;tep tending to produce a rupture between the two nations; and propo&s;ing that new efforts &s;hould be made for per&s;uading the

<P>Hitherto the pre&s;byterian$ and independents had acted in concert again&s;t their &s;overeign: but now their mutual animo&s;ity began to appear. Oliver Cromwell, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed $word$ re$olution, unbounded ambition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1647.</NOTE> and impenetrable di&s;&s;imulation, $word$ the whole conduct of the indepen|dents. He gained a &s;urpri&s;ing ascendancy over the &s;pirit of general Fairfax, and filled the army with officers devoted to his intere&s;t, &s;uch as Rain&s;borough, Fleetwood, Lambert, and Harri&s;on. The majority of the members in parlia|ment were pre&s;byterians, &s;upported by the city of London: they dreaded the general officers, and wanted to di&s;band the army. As it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end forces into Ireland, they formed a plan of enli&s;ting private men for that &s;ervice, and tran&s;porting them to that kingdom under new officers, in whom they could confide. Cromwell, knowing their de&s;ign, oppo&s;ed it with all his power; and found this ta&s;k the more ea&s;y, as the earl of E&s;&s;ex died in the preceding year. He &s;eemed to approve the &s;cheme of the commons, feigned him&s;elf a rigid pre&s;byterian, talked in the language of &s;cripture, and per&s;uaded Fairfax that he had nothing in view but the glory of God, and the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the true religion. At the &s;ame time he &s;et his emi&s;&s;aries at work to excite a &s;pirit of mutiny among the troops. The inferior officers had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to military licen&s;e, that they could not bear the pro&s;pect of returning to their former occupations.</P>

<P>The commons under&s;tood they had prepared a petition to their ge|neral, for the peru&s;al of the hou&s;e, demanding an act of indemnity, the pay|ment of their arrears, and an exemption from &s;erving in Ireland again&s;t their own con&s;ent. Two colonels, and two lieutenant-colonels, being examined at the bar of the hou&s;e, touching the nature of the petition, were commanded to &s;uppre&s;s it and all other &s;uch addre&s;&s;es as might be drawn up for the future. At the &s;ame time the general was directed to give orders that a declaration &s;hould be read at the head of each regiment, importing that the petition tended to excite di&s;contents in the army; to impede the reduction of Ireland; and that the hou&s;e would proceed again&s;t the authors of it, as perturbators of the pub|lic peace. This expedient &s;erved only to inflame the re&s;entment of the &s;oldiers, who now loudly complained, that after they had &s;hed their blood in defence of the liberties of the nation, they were now, by the mo&s;t in&s;upportable tyranny, debarred the privilege of pre&s;enting a petition to their general: a right to which they were certainly intitled as free-born &s;ubjects of England. When the com|mi&s;&s;ioners, appointed by the parliament, repaired to the army, and cau&s;ed the votes to be read aloud for new-modelling the regiments, colonel Lambert, in the name of all the officers, demanded the act of indemnity, the payment of arrears, &s;ecurity for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence while in Ireland, and the names of the ge|nerals under whom they &s;hould &s;erve in that kingdom. They exclaimed aloud, they were ready to march under Fairfax, Cromwell, and Skippon: &s;ome of the general officers pre&s;ented a declaration to the parliament, ju&s;tifying their former petition, and in&s;i&s;ting upon the &s;ame articles.</P>

<P>The commons voted that the army &s;hould be di&s;banded, and the &s;ol|diers receive &s;ix weeks pay at their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. Then Skippon produced a petition from &s;everal regiments, &s;pecifying their rea&s;ons for not &s;erving in Ire|land, and complaining of the ill treatment they had received from the par|liament. The commons, alarmed at the&s;e marks of di&s;content, pa&s;&s;ed divers votes for giving &s;atisfaction to the army; and ordered Cromwell, Skippon, Ireton, and Fleetwood, to &s;ignify their favourable intentions to the &s;oldiery. It was on this occa&s;ion, that the common &s;oldiers elected agitators or de|puties to di&s;cu&s;s their affairs, and communicate their re&s;olutions to a coun|cil compo&s;ed of generals, field-officers, and captains. The&s;e were the in|&s;truments by which Cromwell and his a&s;&s;ociates managed the whole military machine. They were cho&s;en from the private &s;oldiers or the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of officers, for their reputed knowledge, and their &s;piritual gift of preaching and prayer. The two hou&s;es, &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in their re&s;olution to di&s;band all the troops, except tho&s;e de&s;tined for Ireland, ordained, That &s;ecurity &s;hould be given to the troops for their arrears: That the &s;oldiers &s;hould not be compelled to &s;erve in Ireland: and, That provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for the widows and orphans of tho&s;e maimed in the &s;ervice Then they regulated the manner in which the regiments were to be di&s;banded at different times and places.</P>

<P>When the general, in a council of war, produced the votes of the commons, the officers &s;aid they did not believe the &s;oldiers would be &s;atisfied, becau&s;e they would neither receive their full pay, nor &s;ecurity for their arrears; and, without an act of amne&s;ty, they might be pro&s;ecuted at law after their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. The &s;oldiers them&s;elves, in a petition to the general, complained of the&s;e hard&s;hips, and de&s;ired that the army &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled in one place,

where they might con&s;ider of means to redre&s;s their grievances before they should be $word$ otherwi&s;e they &s;hould be obliged to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as might be prevented by a compliance with their demands. The general, with the advice of the council of war, immediately contracted his quarters; and$ in a letter to the two hou&s;es, begged they would concert mea&s;ures for appearing the army, and preventing a very dangerous rupture. The parlia|ment, intimidated by this intelligence, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to divide the forces. They offered a month's pay to tho&s;e who &s;hould quit their regiments, and engage in the Iri&s;h expedition. For the &s;atisfaction of the army, they voted, That the &s;ubaltern officers and &s;oldiers &s;hould receive the whole of their arrears, and a month's pay over and above: That the declaration of the two hou&s;es again&s;t their petition, &s;hould be erazed from the journal; and, That an act of indemnity &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed in their favour. But all the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions could not &s;atisfy the army. The directors of it were re&s;olved, that it &s;hould<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> not be $$banded, but kept up as a ballance to the presbyterian intere&s;t. It was, by this time, converted into a kind of a republic, in which the vote of a common &s;oldier was equivalent to that of his colonel; and every &s;eparate bri|gade thought they had a right to take re&s;olutions, which were executed in the name of the army: &s;o that very little di&s;cipline or &s;ubordination remained.</P>

<P>A few regiments of hor&s;e re&s;olved to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the king's per&s;on. For the execution of this de&s;ign they pitched upon cornet Joyce, who had been a taylor before the war. On the third of June, this of|ficer arrived with a detachment of fifty hor&s;e at Holmby, about break of day; and going up &s;tairs, attended with three troopers, knocked at the door of the king's apartment. The door being opened, at his maje&s;ty's de&s;ire, Joyce and his companions, approaching him with their hats off, and pi&s;tols in their hands, told him he mu&s;t go to the army. When the king a&s;ked by what authority he came on this expedition, the cornet an&s;wered, "By this;" pointing to his pi&s;tol, and de&s;iring his maje&s;ty would put on his cloaths, as di&s;patch was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The king ordered one of his attendants to call the committee of the two hou&s;es, who had taken charge of his per&s;on. They were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the arrival of Joyce, and a&s;ked if he acted by order of the parlia|ment: he an&s;wered in the negative, and held up his pi&s;tol. They &s;aid they would write to the parliament to know their plea&s;ure: he replied, they might do &s;o, but the king mu&s;t go along with him immediately. Colonel Brown, having &s;ounded the guard which the parliament had &s;et over the king, found them aver&s;e to any re&s;i&s;tance; &s;o that his maje&s;ty, having broken his fa&s;t, went into his coach, attended by a few dome&s;tics, and re&s;igned him&s;elf to the will of Joyce, not without &s;u&s;picion that he &s;hould be carried to &s;ome unfrequented place, and murdered. He had, however, di&s;patched the Scotti&s;h earl of Du$|&s;$rm$ing with a letter to the two hou&s;es, giving an account of this adventure; and de&s;iring they would not give credit to any thing he &s;hould write under con|finement. He lay the fir&s;t night at the hou&s;e of colonel Montague near Cam|bridge, and next day arrived at Newmarket, where he was treated with great respect by the officers of the army. The regiments, being a&s;&s;embled at this place, pre&s;ented a petition to the general, complaining of the parliament; and next day &s;ub&s;cribed a writing, which they termed "The engagement," $word$ to be disbanded, on condition that their grievances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed,

according to the determination of a council compo&s;ed of the generals, together with two officers, and as many &s;oldiers of every regiment; but, declaring they would not &s;eparate until they &s;hould have received this &s;atisfaction. On the &s;eventh day of June, the general informed the two hou&s;es of the king's being removed from Holmby, by the &s;oldiers, who had received no order from their officers for that purpo&s;e. He &s;aid, he had &s;ent colonel Whaley with a detach|ment to meet the king, and reconduct him to Holmby; but that his maje&s;ty had refu&s;ed to return. He a&s;&s;ured them, that neither he, nor any of his officers, had any &s;hare in removing the king: that the &s;ole aim of the army was to e&s;ta|bli&s;h a firm and la&s;ting peace: that they had no intention to oppo&s;e the pre&s;|byterian di&s;cipline, and &s;et up independency: but, they would leave every thing to the prudence of parliament, without pretending to e&s;pou&s;e any particular party.</P>

<P>The commons, in order to vindicate them&s;elves from the impu|tation of acting from intere&s;ted motives, confirmed the &s;elf-denying ordinance; vacated all employments po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by members of parliament; deprived all members of that per&s;onal privilege by which they had been &s;creened from their creditors; declared that all informations again&s;t members &s;hould be heard on an appointed day; and, that no member &s;hould be indemnified for his particular lo&s;&s;es, until the public debts &s;hould be di&s;charged. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e votes, the army advanced to St. Alban's, within twenty miles of London; and the ge|neral &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;es, intreating them to take &s;ome &s;peedy mea&s;ures for the &s;atisfaction of the &s;oldiery. Nothing could be more agreeable to the peo|ple in general, than this commencement of ho&s;tility again&s;t the parliament, which had exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t de&s;potic tyranny over the nation. Tho&s;e clamorous dema|gogues who had un&s;heathed the &s;word again&s;t their &s;overeign, on pretence of &s;creening the &s;ubject from oppre&s;&s;ion, were now the authors of the mo&s;t into|lerable extortion. They had by the mo&s;t arbitrary exaction levied above thirty millions in five years; and &s;till the public was loaded with enormous debts and incumbrances. They are &s;aid to have divided three hundred thou&s;and pounds among their own members. Great &s;ums were &s;ecreted by their committees appointed to manage the different branches of the revenue. The exchequer was now aboli&s;hed, that tho&s;e managers might plunder the public without con|troul. An exci&s;e was extended over butchers meat, and all the common ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life. One half the lands and rents of the kingdom, belonging to the royali&s;ts, were &s;eque&s;tered. Great numbers of the&s;e unhappy &s;ufferers were denied all redre&s;s. The re&s;t could obtain no remedy, but that of paying exor|bitant compo&s;itions, and &s;ub&s;cribing the covenant; &s;o that many antient and honourable families were intirely ruined by tho&s;e up&s;tart plebeians. More than one half of the clergy were deprived of their livings, and reduced to beggary, becau&s;e they would not renounce their civil and religious principles. The country committees continued to fine, impri&s;on, and corporally puni&s;h tho&s;e they &s;tiled malignants, without law, ju&s;tice, or re&s;traint: in cau&s;es of private property, they took vengeance upon tho&s;e who favoured their &s;overeign; and &s;old their protection to the be&s;t bidder. They &s;aid they were authorized to &s;poil the Egyptians: they termed their oppre&s;&s;ive conduct, the dominion of the elect: they pretended to &s;eek the Lord in prayer, and cloaked their iniquity<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hume.</NOTE> with all the grimace of affected holine&s;s.</P>

<P>At the motion of the army, the parliament was overwhelmed with con&s;ternation. They forthwith pa&s;&s;ed an ordinance, impowering the city of London to rai&s;e &s;ome cavalry, as if they intended to put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of d$fence. The general and the re&s;t of the officers wrote a letter to the mayor, complaining that certain members of parliament were de&s;irous of in|volving the nation in a new war, that they them&s;elves might e&s;cape the puni&s;h|ment they had &s;o richly de&s;erved. They prote&s;ted they had no de&s;ign to inter|meddle in affairs of government, or to injure the pre&s;byterians, and the city of London, unle&s;s they &s;hould attempt to protect tho&s;e incendiaries; they declared them&s;elves ready to withdraw to a greater di&s;tance, upon proper a&s;&s;ur$nce that the government would be &s;ettled in an equitable manner; but &s;hould the city take arms again&s;t the army, it would run the ri&s;que of bringing abundance of mi&s;chief on its own head. This letter being communicated to the parl$$$ent, they &s;ent an order to the general, that he &s;hould no: come within five and twenty miles of London. They ordered ten thou&s;and pounds to be payed to the &s;ol|diers who &s;hould quit the army, and engage in the Iri&s;h expedition.

<P>The army, con&s;cious of its own &s;trength, pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance to the two hou&s;es, demanding, That the parliament &s;hould be purged of cor|rupted and unduly elected members: That tho&s;e who had openly oppo&s;ed the army, &s;hould be expelled, and rendered incapable of &s;itting as judges upon &s;ol|diers, even after the army &s;hould be di&s;banded: That &s;ome period &s;hould be fixed to this parliament: and, That for the future, parliaments &s;hould continue only for a certain time: That they &s;hould neither be di&s;&s;olved nor adjourned, but with their own con&s;ent: That the &s;ubject &s;hould be confirmed in the right of pre|&s;enting petitions: That the power of committees and lieutenants of counties, &s;hould be regulated and reduced to proper bounds: That the public accounts &s;hould be equitably &s;ettled: and, That after &s;ome acts of ju&s;tice upon delinquents, an act of amne&s;ty &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed. The next bold &s;tep which they took, was to impeach eleven members of parliament, who were indeed the chiefs of the pre&s;byterian party. They &s;ent a deputation of officers to We&s;tmin&s;ter, to accu&s;e Hollis, Stapleton, Lewis, Clotworthy, Waller, Maynard, Ma&s;&s;ey, Glyn, Long, Harley, and Nichols. The&s;e members were charged with having ob&s;tructed the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice: with having rai&s;ed &s;u&s;picion again&s;t the officers, and endea|voured to &s;ow &s;edition between the parliament and the army: with having formed a de&s;ign to di&s;band the army, to &s;educe the troops, and engage the of|ficers in their mi&s;chievous machinations. Next day they pre&s;ented a memorial to the commons, de&s;iring, that the accu&s;ed members &s;hould be ordered to with|draw: That the army &s;hould receive a month's pay, and the &s;ame advantages granted to tho&s;e who enli&s;ted for the &s;ervice of Ireland: and, That until the diffe|rences between the parliament and the army could be compromi&s;ed, no levies &s;hould be carried on in London or el&s;ewhere.</P>

deputies on purpo&s;e to complain, that the people were oppre&s;&s;ed by the com|mittees which the parliament had e&s;tabli&s;hed in the different counties. The two hou&s;es were fain to comply with all the demands of the army; which being de|termined again&s;t accommodation, produced a new remon&s;trance, threatening to employ extraordinary means, unle&s;s they &s;hould receive immediate &s;atisfaction with re&s;pect to the following articles: That the declaration inviting officers and &s;oldiers to quit the army, &s;hould be revoked and annulled: That the king &s;hould remain with the army: That the accu&s;ed members &s;hould be expelled: That the officers and &s;oldiers who had abandoned the army, &s;hould be di&s;banded and di&s;per&s;ed: That the reduced officers &s;hould quit London: That levies &s;hould cea&s;e; and the parliament put an end to the difference &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them and the army. After this remon&s;trance was delivered, the troops advanced as far as Uxbridge; and the king's friends began to hope that a rupture between the parliament and the army would redound to his maje&s;ty's advantage. The king him&s;elf was of that opinion. He was treated with all imaginable defe|rence by the troops, among whom he found him&s;elf very much at his ea&s;e; and Cromwell, with his confederates, a&s;&s;ured him they would re&s;tore him to his former dignity. The two hou&s;es were &s;o &s;tartled at this pro&s;pect, that they re&s;olved to gratify the army with every &s;ort of conce&s;&s;ion. The accu&s;ed mem|bers de&s;ired leave to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the hou&s;e, and every other &s;tep was taken for their &s;atisfaction: &s;o that, at length, the army &s;eemed &s;atisfied; and the head-quarters were fixed at Wickham.</P>

<P>The pre&s;byterians were di&s;gu&s;ted at this tame conde&s;cen&s;ion of the parliament in favour of the independents. They engaged in an a&s;&s;ociation with the magi&s;trates of London, to oppo&s;e force with force. They &s;ent private agents into Scotland to &s;olicit a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The common-council pre&s;ented a petition to the two hou&s;es, complaining of the arbitrary power exerci&s;ed by the committees; demanding they would take proper mea&s;ures to repre&s;s the in&s;o|lence of the army, &s;ettle the government, re-e&s;tabli&s;h the king in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ju&s;t rights, according to the covenant, pro&s;ecute the war in Ireland with vigour, puni&s;h delinquents, and pa&s;s an act of amne&s;ty. Petitions were like|wi&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth,</NOTE> delivered by the apprentices and populace, de&s;iring that the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline might be e&s;tabli&s;hed on a &s;ure footing; that the in&s;olence of &s;ectaries might be repre&s;&s;ed; and the army payed off and di&s;banded. The&s;e commotions were countenanced by the accu&s;ed members, and many others of that hou&s;e, who would have ri&s;qued a rupture with the army; but they were over-ruled by the caution of the majority. The army being informed of the tran&s;actions in London, and the me&s;&s;age &s;ent to Scotland, demanded, in another petition, that the parliament &s;hould publi&s;h a declaration, prohibiting foreign troops to enter the kingdom; that the forces &s;hould be regularly payed; and the militia of London &s;ettled on its antient footing. The hou&s;es immediately complied with their reque&s;t. The rigid pre&s;byterians, incen&s;ed at this &s;ervile complai&s;ance, joined with the common-council of London, and a good number of mem+bers of parliament, in forming an engagement, by which they bound them|&s;elves to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in oppo&s;ing the army, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that its in|tention was to overthrow every mea&s;ure which had hitherto been taken towards e&s;tabli&s;hing the peace of the kingdom. They engaged to employ their lives and fortunes in defending the king's authority and per&s;on, the privileges of par|liament,
<PB N="326" REF="3280">
and the liberties of the people. The two hou&s;es publi&s;hed, by &s;ound of trumpet, a prohibition to &s;ign this engagement. Nevertherle&s;s, the pre&s;by|terians in London held a&s;&s;emblies, and enli&s;ted &s;oldiers; the common-council received two petitions from the burghers and apprentices, de&s;iring that the mi|litia might be regulated according to the ordinance of the fourth day of May, which had been lately aboli&s;hed by the two hou&s;es. In con&s;equence of the&s;e re|mon&s;trances, the common-council petitioned the parliament, that the la&s;t might be revoked, and the other confirmed. By the ordinance of May, the city of Lon|don had entru&s;ted the militia to a new committee, compo&s;ed of pre&s;byterians; but, this ordinance they afterwards recalled at the de&s;ire of the army.</P>

<P>On the twenty-&s;ixth day of July, a great multitude of the populace a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, with a petition, demanding, that the new ordinance touching the militia, &s;hould be revoked; that the declara|tion again&s;t the engagement &s;hould be annulled; and an order imme|diately i&s;&s;ued to recal the ab&s;ent members, particularly the eleven who had been accu&s;ed. The&s;e commotions were influenced by Sir William Waller, Pointz, and Ma&s;&s;ey, who had been removed from their employments by the new model, and now re&s;ided in London. While the parliament deliberated upon tho&s;e demands, the populace were very clamorous in the halls adjoining to the two hou&s;es. They knocked at the doors of the upper hou&s;e, broke the windows with &s;tones, and committed &s;uch outrages as terrified the mem|bers into a compliance with their demands. They voted, That the la&s;t ordinance touching the militia, &s;hould be annulled; and adjourned till next day: but, the multitude compelled the &s;peaker and the members to re&s;ume their places, and ordain, that the king &s;hould return to London. The general &s;ent a letter to the common-council, expre&s;&s;ing great affec|tion for the city of London, and complaining of the violence which had been offered to the parliament. They returned a civil an&s;wer, excu&s;ing what had been done, and de&s;iring he would not approach nearer to the city; but, being informed that the army was on its march towards London, they ordered the militia to guard the lines; and all the inhabitants able to carry arms, to repair to the quarters a&s;&s;igned.</P>

<P>The parliament meeting after a &s;hort adjournment, found that the &s;peakers of the two hou&s;es, with a good number of members, had quitted London. They forthwith &s;ub&s;tituted other &s;peakers, and were not &s;orry that the friends to the army had withdrawn them&s;elves. They voted, That the king &s;hould return to London: That the committee of the London militia &s;hould be authori&s;ed to rai&s;e troops for the defence of the city, as well as to chu&s;e a general acceptable to the parliament; and, that he &s;hould appoint the officers, with the approbation of the committee. The choice $ell upon major|general Ma&s;&s;ey; and a day was appointed for delivering commi&s;&s;ions, and di&s;|po&s;ing the troops into regiments. The common-council received another me|nacing letter from the general; and, in their turn, publi&s;hed an apology, which was no other than a recrimination upon the army, for its in&s;olence and arbitrary proceedings. The parliament under&s;tanding that the general approached Lon|don, on pretence of protecting them from violence, &s;ent a letter to a&s;&s;ure him they needed no protection; and as his march to London would be productive of mi&s;chief, they expre&s;sly ordered him to withdraw his troops to a greater di&s;tance.
<PB N="327" REF="3290">
They recalled the ab&s;ent and accu&s;ed members; while Ma&s;&s;ey, Waller, and Pointz were employed in forming their regiments and companies. The two &s;peakers, and the other members who had ab&s;ented them&s;elves, to the number of &s;ixty-&s;ix, demanded the protection of the general, alledging that they had been obliged to quit the hou&s;es for fear of being torn in pieces by the popu|lace. The army was glad of this pretext for marching to London, in order to re&s;tore the members, to whom they payed the re&s;pect that was due to the par|liament; and continued their route for Houn&s;low-heath, which was the place of rendezvous. The earl of Manche&s;ter and Lenthal, &s;peakers of the two hou&s;es, together with the other members who had retired to the army, were presbyterians in their hearts; but they fore&s;aw the army would at length pre|vail, and they took this method to &s;ave them&s;elves from de&s;truction.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="30" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXX.</HEAD>
<P>The army now publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, acquitting them&s;elves of the imputations laid to their charge, recapitulating the arbitrary mea&s;ures of the pre&s;byterian faction; declaring they would &s;upport the two &s;peakers, who had fled to their protection, and puni&s;h the authors of the&s;e di&s;orders. The courage of the citizens vani&s;hed, when they under&s;tood that the army had advanced to Houn&s;low. The common-council wrote a letter to the gene|ral, importing, That, as it appeared from his declaration, he had no other de&s;ign than to do ju&s;tice to the ab&s;ent members, the city was ready to concur with him; that they had ordered all the avenues to be opened, and put an end to their preparations of defence. On the &s;ixth day of Augu&s;t, Fairfax, ac|companied by the &s;peakers, and the members who had ab&s;ented them&s;elves, arrived in We&s;tmin&s;ter with an e&s;corte of dragoons; and the members forthwith re&s;umed their places in parliament. The two hou&s;es immediately concurred in voting, that the general &s;hould be con&s;tituted governor of the Tower. They appointed a day of thank&s;giving for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the parliament with|out blood&s;hed; and they ordained that the army &s;hould receive a month's pay as a gratuity. The lords propo&s;ed that all the tran&s;actions of parliament, from the twenty-&s;ixth day of July, to the &s;ixth of Augu&s;t, &s;hould be annulled; and that the members who had &s;at at We&s;tmin&s;ter during the ab&s;ence of the two &s;peakers, &s;hould be excluded from their &s;eats in parliament, and puni&s;hed for their pre&s;umption. The army had, in a remon&s;trance, made the &s;ame de|mands;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> but, after violent debates in the lower hou&s;e, they were rejected by a very &s;mall majority. Neverthele&s;s, &s;even peers, the mayor and aldermen of London, together with &s;ome officers of militia, were accu&s;ed of trea&s;on, for having been concerned in tumults, and endeavouring to excite a new war. The two hou&s;es re&s;olved, with the concurrence of the army, to &s;end &s;ix thou|&s;and foot &s;oldiers, four thou&s;and hor&s;e, and five hundred dragoons, to Ireland; to maintain &s;ix and twenty thou&s;and men in England, and di&s;band the re&s;t of the forces. But the&s;e re&s;olutions were executed &s;lowly, and each &s;ide endea|voured to amu&s;e the other. Though the army had at fir&s;t pretended to nothing but the care of their own concerns, they now profe&s;&s;ed to &s;ettle the common|wealth; and, before their march towards London, pre&s;ented to the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the parliament, a &s;et of propo&s;als &s;eemingly for this purpo&s;e, though they were c$$$ulated for retarding the &s;ettlement, which the authors of $hem profe&s;&s;ed to forward and promote.</P>

<P>The king &s;till continued in the neighbourhood of the army, by which he was treated with the mo&s;t flattering marks of di&s;tinction. His chap|lains were permitted to attend him, and celebrate &s;ervice according to the forms of the Engli&s;h church. He was permitted to conver&s;e with his old &s;er|vants. Sir John Berkeley and A&s;hburnham attended his per&s;on; and even the marquis of Ormond had free acce&s;s to his pre&s;ence: but the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure he enjoyed, was the company of his own children, with whom he had &s;everal interviews, which were &s;o tender, that they &s;eemed to melt the heart of Oliver Cromwell, who declared, he had never &s;een &s;uch a pathetic &s;cene as the meeting of this fond parent with his infant offspring, and extolled the king for the benevolence of his di&s;po&s;ition. He was vi&s;ited by the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, who expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t eager de&s;ire to &s;erve him, thinking it was their real intere&s;t to unite with their &s;overeign again&s;t the independents, who were their common enemies. Cromwell and his a&s;&s;ociates care&s;&s;ed his maje&s;ty, in order to prevent this union, and a&s;&s;ured him they would not lay down their arms, until he &s;hould be re&s;tored to his former dignity. Charles dete&s;ted the pre&s;byterians, as the inveterate enemies of the hierarchy, and the authors of all the troubles to which he and the kingdom had been expo&s;ed: but he prudently maintained a corre&s;pondence with both &s;ides, in hope of being cho&s;en as umpire to decide their difference; or at lea&s;t of holding the balance between them, &s;o as to make either &s;cale preponderate. He had too great an opinion of his own importance. Cromwell, Ireton, and the other chiefs of the independent faction, amu&s;ed him with vain hopes, until they had obtained a complete victory over the pre&s;byterians and the city. Then they abated in their expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect; he was more &s;trictly guarded; they would hardly allow his dome&s;tics to conver&s;e with him in private; he remained at Hampton-court, without receiving any further propo&s;als of accommoda|tion; and &s;pies were employed to mark all his words and actions. He now perceived he had been the dupe of Cromwell, and began to be apprehen&s;ive of mi&s;chievous de&s;igns upon his per&s;on. The army pre&s;ented him in private with propo&s;als of peace, much more &s;evere than tho&s;e which had been offered to him at Newca&s;tle; and, becau&s;e he rejected them, the officers were offended. Cromwell bitterly reproached A&s;hburnham, the king's chief confident, for having a&s;&s;i&s;ted his maje&s;ty in treating with the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, in order to engage that nation to act again&s;t the army. Major Huntington, whom Crom|well had employed in conveying &s;ecret me&s;&s;ages to the king, gave his maje&s;ty to under&s;tand, that his employer would ruin him, if not prevented. He forth|with re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion, and even offered to di&s;cover Cromwell's &s;ini&s;ter practices to the parliament; but he was refu&s;ed a hearing.</P>

<P>Finally, the king being warned from different quarters, and by various channels, of the de&s;igns that were harboured again&s;t his life, re&s;olved to withdraw him&s;elf from the army. Early in the evening, he retired to his cham|ber, on pretence of being indi&s;po&s;ed; and, in an hour after midnight, went down the back-&s;tairs, attended with A&s;hburnham and Legg, both gentlemen of the bed-ch$mber. Sir John Berkeley waited for him at the garden-gate with hor&s;es, which they in&s;tantly mounted, and directed their route towards Hamp|&s;hire. A&s;hburnham &s;aid he had be&s;poke a &s;hip for conveying the king to &s;ome
<PB N="329" REF="3310">
part of the continent, or to Jer&s;ey: but the ve&s;&s;el could not be found at the place appointed. The royal fugitive, thus di&s;appointed, repaired to Tichfield, a &s;eat belonging to the earl of Southampton, and di&s;covered him&s;elf to that nobleman's mother, who received him with the warme&s;t cordiality. There he deliberated with his friends about his next excu$&s;ion; and they advi&s;ed him to cro&s;s over to the i&s;le of Wight, which was under the government of colonel Hammond, who enjoyed a great &s;hare of Cromwell's confidence. A&s;hburn|ham and Berkeley were &s;ent before, to exact a promi&s;e of this officer, that if he could not protect, he would not detain his maje&s;ty's per&s;on. Hammond &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at their addre&s;s; expre&s;&s;ed his inclination to &s;erve his maje&s;ty, but owned, at the &s;ame time, he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of obeying his &s;uperiors. When he under&s;tood where the king was, he accompanied them to Tichfield with a guard of &s;oldiers, and &s;tayed in a lower apartment while A&s;hburnham went up to the king's chamber. Charles no &s;ooner under&s;tood that Hammond was in the hou&s;e, than he exclaimed, "O Jack! thou ha&s;t undone me!" The other &s;hed a flood of tears, and offered to go down and di&s;patch the colonel: but the king would not con&s;ent to &s;uch an expedient. He re|collected all his fortitude; and &s;ent for Hammond, who repeated his pro|fe&s;&s;ions of regard, and &s;eemed to believe the army would take no &s;tep to his prejudice. Charles &s;ubmitted to his fate, accompanied the colonel to the I&s;le<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon.</NOTE> of Wight, and was lodged at Cari&s;brook-ca&s;tle, where at fir&s;t he found him&s;elf treated with marks of duty and re&s;pect. Though A&s;hburnham's conduct, on this occa&s;ion, has the air of treachery, the king acquitted him of any trea|&s;onable intention; and, in all probability, he was outwitted by the emi&s;&s;aries of Cromwell and Ireton, who found &s;ome method to per&s;uade him that the king's per&s;on would be fafer in the I&s;le of Wight than with the army. If that was the ca&s;e, he concealed his de&s;ign from the king, who perhaps would have di&s;approved of the &s;cheme, and amu&s;ed him with the hope of a ve&s;&s;el which he had never intended to provide. If he was free of di&s;loyalty, he was certainly guilty of the mo&s;t unwarrantable pre&s;umption and temerity.</P>

<P>The parliament was informed of the king's e&s;cape by Cromwell, who tran&s;mitted to them a letter, left by his maje&s;ty on the table, addre&s;&s;ed to both hou&s;es. He complained of the rigorous captivity he had undergone, among people who were continually fluctuating in their principles; who were not a&s;hamed to declare a de&s;ign of de&s;troying the nobility, by depriving the peers of their negative voice in parliament; and who favoured and encouraged the principles of the levellers. He &s;aid his intention was to conceal him&s;elf for &s;ome time, even from the knowledge of his friends; neverthele&s;s, he earne&s;tly wi&s;hed for peace; and declared, he would contribute all that lay in his power, for the &s;atisfaction of all parties. La&s;tly, he de&s;ired to be heard with honour and &s;afety, in which ca&s;e he would quit his retreat, and appear in public. On the fifteenth day of November, the earl of Manche&s;ter, &s;peaker of the upper hou&s;e, received a letter from colonel Hammond, informing their lord&s;hips, that the king had come to the I&s;le of Wight, and put him&s;elf under his protection.</P>

<P>Cromwell now began to be di&s;turbed by a &s;ect of his own rai&s;ing. He and his a&s;&s;ociates had indulged the &s;oldiers to &s;uch a degree of licence, that he found it extremely difficult to reduce them to any &s;ort of &s;ubordination.
<PB N="330" REF="3320">
When the differences between the parliament and the army were compromi&s;ed, the generals had no further occa&s;ion for the concurrence of the common &s;ol|diers: their councils were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the agitators remanded to their re|&s;pective regiments. They refu&s;ed to obey the&s;e orders; the councils and con|ferences were continued; they claimed an equal &s;hare with their generals, in regulating the government; they pretend$d to aboli&s;h all di&s;tinctions, and thence acquired the appellation of lev$llers. The&s;e principles would have pro|duced divi&s;ion and anarchy among the troops, and entirely de&s;troyed the au|thority of the generals, had not they been nipped in the bud by the conduct and re&s;olution of Cromwell. He repaired to a meeting of tho&s;e levellers, with a guard of cho&s;en men, and began to expo&s;tulate with them upon the danger|ous con&s;equences of their &s;tubborn and precipitate conduct. Finding them deaf to his remon&s;trances, he fell upon them all of a &s;udden, routed and di&s;|per&s;ed the whole body, ordered &s;ome of the pri&s;oners to be hanged upon the &s;pot, and &s;ent the re&s;t to London. By acting with the &s;ame vigour and in|trepidity on &s;everal other occa&s;ions, he broke the mutinous &s;pirit of this dan|gerous &s;ect, and reduced the army to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>The king being di&s;appointed in his hope of e&s;caping, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the two hou&s;es, accompanied with propo&s;als for an accommodation. Though his con&s;cience would not permit him to give up the order of bi&s;hops, he was contented that the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline, at pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;hould continue during three years, on condition that he, and others of the Engli&s;h church, &s;hould be permitted to u&s;e their own rites, without incurring any penalty; that the eccle&s;ia&s;tical a&s;&s;embly at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;hould con&s;ult and deliberate with twenty theologicians of his nominating, upon the &s;ubject of religion, that he and the two hou&s;es might fix upon a form of church-government, according to the word of God; and that all per&s;ons &s;hould enjoy liberty of con&s;cience, without prejudice to the laws enacted again&s;t popi&s;h recu&s;ants, athei&s;ts, and un|believers. He &s;aid he would con&s;ent to an act of parliament, ve&s;ting the power of the militia in the two hou&s;es, during his whole reign, provided that it &s;hould be afterwards reunited with the crown, as in the reigns of Elizabeth and James; and he propo&s;ed that, during his whole reign, all the great officers of &s;tate, and privy-coun&s;ellors, &s;hould be nominated by the two hou&s;es. He offered to aboli&s;h the court of wards and liveries, and to pa&s;s an act of oblivion; and he demanded permi&s;&s;ion to treat in per&s;on, with honour, liberty, and &s;afety. When the king quitted Hampton-court, the two hou&s;es had prepared a &s;et of propo&s;itions for his maje&s;ty; but they were not &s;ent, becau&s;e the Scotti&s;h com|mi&s;&s;ioners rai&s;ed continual ob&s;tacles, complaining that the&s;e propo&s;als did not &s;ufficiently provide for the intere&s;t of their country. The Scots at that time hoped to conclude a &s;eparate peace with him upon their own terms; but they in&s;i&s;ted upon the abolition of epi&s;copacy; and this was a demand with which he would not comply.</P>

<P>At length the two hou&s;es re&s;olved to treat with the king, pro|vided he would give his a&s;&s;ent to four preliminary acts, for e&s;tabli&s;hing the militia; recalling all the declarations publi&s;hed again&s;t the parliament and their adherents; depriving peers created &s;ince the troubles, of their right to fit in parliament; and empowering the two hou&s;es to adjourn at their own plea&s;ure.

time to &s;tart objections; and the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners in vain attempted to throw ob&s;tacles in their way. The parliament was now re&s;olved to break the mea&s;ures of the independents; and, on the &s;ixth day of November, received another me&s;&s;age from the king, demanding a per&s;onal treaty. The commi&s;|&s;ioners from Scotland pre&s;ented a long memorial to parliament, complaining that the two hou&s;es violated the covenant, in &s;eeking to treat of peace with|out their concurrence; and objecting to the propo&s;als that were prepared. The hou&s;es an&s;wered this memorial in very acrimonous terms, and ordered the printer to be impri&s;oned. Then they appointed a committee to pre&s;ent the bills to his maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>The Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners at the &s;ame time repaired to the I&s;le of Wight, with the articles of a treaty drawn up in form. Charles pru|dently refu&s;ed to pa&s;s the four bills, without any &s;ecurity for the &s;ucce&s;s of the treaty, becau&s;e he ju&s;tly feared, that after having granted the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, he &s;hould find the two hou&s;es as implacable as before. He was better plea&s;ed with the conditions offered by the Scots. The duke of Hamilton had made a tender of his &s;ervices, which was very agreeable to his maje&s;ty. The mar|quis of Ormond had communicated to him a &s;cheme of joining the lord Inche|quin in Ireland, and rai&s;ing forces for his &s;ervice in that kingdom. The Scots undertook to a&s;&s;emble an army in his behalf; and he imagined that the union of his friends with the pre&s;byterians of both kingdoms, would be able to cru&s;h the power of the independents. Influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he concluded a &s;ecret treaty with the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, in which he pro|mi&s;ed to confirm the covenant in England and Scotland, together with the pre&s;by|terian government, for three years, during which the affairs of religion &s;hould be &s;ettled by an a&s;&s;embly of theologi&s;ts and eccle&s;ia&s;tics of both kingdoms. They engaged that the kingdom of Scotland &s;hould defend the rights of his crown again&s;t all opponents; for which purpo&s;e it &s;hould &s;end an army into England, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h him upon the throne, effect an union of the two na|tions, and procure a &s;olid peace. The commi&s;&s;ioners &s;tipulated &s;everal other advantages for their country, and returned very well plea&s;ed with the &s;ucce&s;s of their negotiation.</P>

<P>The king had no &s;ooner di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the committee of parlia|ment with a refu&s;al, than the governor ordered all his dome&s;tics to quit the ca&s;tle, and confined him &s;o clo&s;ely that no per&s;on could &s;peak to him without having fir&s;t obtained permi&s;&s;ion. An officer of the name of Burley re&s;iding in the I&s;le of Wight, was fired with indignation at the unworthy treatment to which his &s;overeign was expo&s;ed; and endeavoured to engage &s;ome people in a de&s;ign to re&s;cue the king from the hands of his enemies; but, before he could put his &s;cheme in execution, he was apprehended, condemned, and put to death. When the king's an&s;wer was reported in the hou&s;e of commons, &s;everal members &s;poke with great virulence again&s;t his per&s;on; and in particu|lar Oliver Cromwell, who called him a man of blood, and a double dealer. He advi&s;ed them to &s;end no further addre&s;&s;es to the king, but to regulate the affairs of the nation without his concurrence. His propo&s;al was &s;upported by his a&s;&s;ociates; and, after violent debates, the hou&s;e re&s;olved, that for the fu|ture no addre&s;&s;es or me&s;&s;ages &s;hould be &s;ent to the king. They publi&s;hed a de|claration<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> on the &s;ubject, containing all the bitterne&s;s and malice of the famous
<PB N="332" REF="3340">
remon&s;trance on the &s;tate of the kingdom, together with additional reproaches upon the king's &s;ub&s;equent conduct. This &s;tep, however, was not taken without great oppo&s;ition in the hou&s;e of commons, where there was &s;till a majority of pre&s;byterians, though they were intimidated by Cromwell, and overawed by the neighbourhood of the army.</P>

<P>The Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, before they returned to their own country, concerted mea&s;ures with the marquis of Ormond, the other friends of the king in England, and the leading m$n among the presbyterians. They agreed that the marquis &s;hould join Inchequin, who commanded the parlia|ment's troops in Mu$$ter, and had declared for his &s;overeign: be&s;ides, &s;ome chiefs of the rebels, di&s;gu&s;ted at the tyranny exerci&s;ed by the pope's nuncio in Ireland, had promi&s;ed to reinforce Ormond with a con&s;iderable body of forces. The cavaliers undertook to rai&s;e in&s;urrections in different counties of England; and the officers, excluded from the army by the new model, engaged in the &s;ame de&s;ign. Sir Marmaduke Langdale, and Sir Philip Mu&s;grave, who had great influence in the North, re&s;olved to &s;ecure Berwick and Carli&s;le; and the presbyterian party in London, and in the hou&s;e of commons, began to make preparations for appearing openly again&s;t the parliament. Had this &s;cheme been duly dige&s;ted, and all the parts of it executed at the &s;ame time, Cromwell would have had occa&s;ion for all his talents, to pre&s;erve the footing he had gained; but, as they did not concur in one connected plan, acted at different times, without unanimity and proper preparation, the army found no difficulty in quelling one party before another declared it&s;elf, until all oppo&s;ition was &s;ubdued.</P>

<P>The parliament of Scotland a&s;&s;embled on the tenth day of March, notwith&s;tanding the intrigues of the marquis of Argyle, who, though a rigid presbyterian in religion, was an independent in politics, and had engaged in an intimacy of friend&s;hip with Vane and Cromwell. The moderate presbyterians were headed by the duke of Hamilton, his brother the earl of Lanerk, and lord London. Their intere&s;t predominated on this occa&s;ion; and the duke was cho&s;en pre&s;ident of the committee of danger, appointed to provide for the &s;afety of the kingdom. Argyle, finding his party outnumbered in parliament, had recour&s;e to the general a&s;&s;embly, which had almo&s;t turned the &s;cale in his favour. The committee$ having examined the &s;tate of the kingdom, found it in great danger, and declared it would be nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e an army of forty thou&s;and men, to put it in a proper po&s;ture of defence. The commi&s;&s;ioners of the a&s;&s;embly oppo&s;ed this expedient with great violence and ob&s;tinacy. They pre&s;ented a great number of demands to parliament, in&s;i&s;ting upon the danger and iniquity of engaging in a war without provocation. Eighteen lords and forty members of parliament &s;olemnly prote&s;ted again&s;t the vote for levying an army. The marquis of Argyle, and his adherents, affirmed, that the in|tention of the committee was to &s;upport the king's parti&s;ans, the mortal enemies of the Scots, and of all the presbyterians in both kingdoms; that Edinburgh already &s;warmed with cavaliers, &s;uch as Langda$e, Mu&s;grave, Glenham, Fleming, and others, who hated the covenanters with the mo&s;t inveterate ran|cour; and that a junction with the king's party, compo&s;ed of papi&s;ts, epi&s;copals, and other malignants, was a manife&s;t violation of the covenant. The&s;e repre|&s;entations, joined to the efforts of certain envoys, &s;ent thither by the indepen|dents
<PB N="333" REF="3350">
of England, made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon the people, that the parlia|ment could not help i&s;&s;uing an ordinance, excluding from their army and pro|tection all per&s;ons who &s;hould refu&s;e to &s;ub&s;cribe the covenant. The duke of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> Hamilton, who was declared general, found him&s;elf obliged to di&s;mi&s;s the cavaliers, a&s;&s;uring them that he would elude this order as &s;oon as he &s;hould have entered England. In a word, he met with continual ob&s;tacles, which retarded his levies. In&s;tead of forty, he could hardly a&s;&s;emble fourteen thou|&s;and men, and the&s;e ill-armed and undi&s;ciplined; and his army was not in a condition to march till the beginning of July.</P>

<P>During the&s;e preparations, Langhorn, Powel, and Poyer, three co|lonels who had &s;erved in the parliament's army, declared for the king, &s;ecured the ca&s;tle of Pembroke, and influenced the greate&s;t part of South-Wales to e&s;pou&s;e the royal cau&s;e; while lord Byron endeavoured in North Wales and Che&s;hire to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection in favour of his &s;overeign; and the people of Kent took arms, under the command of one Mr. Hales, a young gentleman of great fortune, but &s;mall experience or capacity. General Fairfax &s;ent Crom|well with a detachment to reduce the Wel&s;h and oppo&s;e the Scots, &s;hould they invade the kingdom; while he him&s;elf continued at London to prevent di&s;tur+bances in that city, and ob&s;erve the motions of the Kenti&s;h in&s;urgents. The&s;e were increa&s;ed to a great number; and lord Goring, now earl of Norwich, and Sir William Waller headed them, in expectation that London would declare for them, &s;hould they approach that city. With this hope they advanced to Blackheath; and Fairfax immediately took the field. Then they retired, &s;ome to Roche&s;ter, and others to Maid&s;tone; which la&s;t place the general took by a&s;&s;ault, where a great number of the enemy was killed and taken pri&s;oners. The re&s;t abandoned Roche&s;ter, and took po&s;t on Houn&s;low-heath, in hope of being &s;uccoured by the city of London; but, being di&s;appointed in this hope, they di&s;per&s;ed at the approach of the army. The earl of Norwich cro&s;&s;ed the Thames at Grave&s;end, in boats, with about five hundred men, in order to join the king's friends in E&s;&s;ex. Tho&s;e were a&s;&s;embled, to the number of three thou&s;and, under lord Capel, Sir William Compton, Sir Charles Lucas, Sir George Li&s;le, Sir Bernard Ga&s;coign, and colonel Farr, which la&s;t had been in the &s;ervice of the parliament. They took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Colche&s;ter, where they propo&s;ed to remain until they could join the Scotti&s;h army, which they heard was already on its march. They were &s;oon inve&s;ted by Fairfax, who &s;eeing the place almo&s;t de&s;titute of defences, attempted to enter by force, but was repul&s;ed with &s;uch lo&s;s, that, being unwilling to hazard another a&s;&s;ault, he re|&s;olved to reduce it by famine, and formed the blockade &s;o clo&s;e as to prevent the be&s;ieged from receiving the lea&s;t &s;uccour or reinforcement.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions there had been a commotion in London among the populace who favoured the king. They defeated a troop of the militia, &s;ecured two of the city-gates, compelled the mayor to take refuge in the Tower, advanced to Whitehall, exclaiming, "For God and the king;" and were at la&s;t di&s;per&s;ed by two regiments of cavalry. The king's &s;econd &s;on, the duke of York, found means to e&s;cape from St. James's, where he had been kept under the eye of the earl of Northumberland, and retired to Holland, where he was cordially received by his &s;i&s;ter the prince&s;s of Orange. Langdale and Mu&s;grave &s;urpri&s;ed Berwick and Carli&s;le; and, in a little time, found them|&s;elves
<PB N="334" REF="3360">
at the head of four thou&s;and royali&s;ts; &s;o that they were in a condition to go $n que&s;t of general Lambert, who commanded in tho&s;e parts for the parliaments but, by an expre&s;s order from Edinburgh, they were for$id to hazard an$ a$$$on until the Scotti&s;h army &s;hould have entered England. In the latter end of May, the &s;a$lors of a &s;quadron, lying in the Downs, revolted again&s;t their commander R$insborough, whom they &s;et a&s;hore, together with &s;ome other officers di&s;affected to the royal cau&s;e. Being &s;upplied with provi&s;ion by the king's friends in Kent, they &s;teered their &s;quadron to the Brill, and deli|vered it to the duke of York, whom the king had appointed high-admiral of England. The prince of Wales, who had retired to Paris, where he re&s;ided with his mother, was no &s;ooner informed of this lucky incident, than he repaired to Helvoet&s;luys; and, going on board of the fleet, was received with loud acclamations. He &s;ent his brother to the Hague, and &s;et &s;ail for Eng|land, in order to join and head the Scotti&s;h army, when it &s;hould enter that kingdom. When he arrived at Yarmouth, the inhabitants refu&s;ed him admit|tance; then he directed his cour&s;e to the river Thames, and took &s;everal rich ve&s;&s;els belonging to the Londoners, which were afterwards re&s;tored. Mean while, the earl of Warwick a&s;&s;embled a &s;quadron, with which he &s;ailed in que&s;t of the prince; and anchored his &s;hips &s;o near him in the river, that an engage|ment was thought unavoidable. The prince of Wales was eager for battle, and had actually weighed, in order to attack the earl; but, the wind failing, and afterwards blowing full in his teeth, he could not execute his re&s;olution. Warwick was reinforced with &s;ome fre&s;h &s;hips; and the royal fleet being in want of provi&s;ion, young Charles was per&s;uaded to return to Helvoet&s;luys, whither he was followed by the enemy. In the beginning of June the royali&s;ts<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$arendon. Ru$hworth.</NOTE> &s;urpri&s;ed the ca&s;tle of Pontefract in York&s;hire, which they &s;ecured with a good garri&s;on: and about the &s;ame time, Scarborough revolted from the parliament.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="43" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>At this juncture, the earl of Holland, who had changed &s;ides &s;o often, formed a de&s;ign in favour of his maje&s;ty. The Scotti&s;h army was ready to march; Cromwell was employed in the &s;iege of Pembroke ca&s;tle; Fairfax engaged in the blockade of Colche&s;ter, while not above two regiments re|mained in London; and the pre&s;byterian party had regained its influence in parliament. The earl of Holland, thinking there could not be a more favour|able opportunity for executing the &s;cheme he had projected, &s;et out from Lon|don publicly, attended by about an hundred hor&s;emen, and was joined at King&s;ton upon Thames by the duke of Buckingham, his brother lord Francis Villiers, and the earl of Peterborough, with &s;ome forces. They forthwith &s;ent a letter to the mayor and common-council of the city, declaring their intention of joining the troops of Surrey, Su&s;&s;ex, and Middle&s;ex, in order to deliver the king, and e&s;tabli&s;h the peace of the nation; and de&s;iring the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lon|don, as their &s;ole aim was peace and the welfare of the kingdom, according to the covenant. The magi&s;trates of the city, having very little confidence in the earl and his confederates, &s;ent the letter to the parliament, by which the three noblemen were in&s;tantly declared traitors to their country. That &s;ame day their hor&s;e were attacked by colonel Lewe&s;y, who routed them in the neighbourhood of King&s;ton; and lord Francis Villiers was &s;lain in the engagement: but, in the night, the leaders abandoned the place, and retired with about four hundred men to St. Alban's. They were afterwards &s;urpri&s;ed at St. Neots by colonel
<PB N="335" REF="3370">
Scroop, who took the earl of Holland, and conducted him to London, from whence he was removed to the ca&s;tle of Warwick: the other two noblemen e&s;caped, and the whole project mi&s;carried. On the eleventh day of July, the duke of Hamilton entered England at the head of the Scotti&s;h army; and Crom|well, having reduced the ca&s;tle of Pembroke, began his march to join Lambert, who commanded for the parliament in the northern counties.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>Had the duke of Hamilton advanced immediately into the heart of the kingdom, before the &s;eparate bodies of the Engli&s;h army could join toge|ther, in all probability he would have effected the re&s;toration of his &s;overeign. The city of London would have &s;hut its gates again&s;t Fairfax, and the royali&s;ts would have taken up arms in &s;o many different parts of the kingdom, that the independents mu&s;t have been divided, di&s;tracted, and overpowered: but the duke and his army &s;eemed to act upon different principles. He de&s;ired to re&s;tore the king without conditions. The presbyterians, of whom his troops were compo&s;ed, in&s;i&s;ted upon the treaty which their commi&s;&s;ioners had concluded with his maje&s;ty. They refu&s;ed to march with the royali&s;ts, becau&s;e they &s;crupled to take the covenant; they &s;u&s;pected their general of having a warm &s;ide to epi&s;copacy; therefore thwarted his mea&s;ures, and retarded his motions. He removed the Engli&s;h garri&s;on from Carlile, in which he left a body of his own countrymen. He was joined by Sir Marmaduke Langdale, with four thou&s;and foot and &s;even hundred hor&s;e; but this officer was obliged to march always at a di&s;tance from the Scots, to elude the order of their parliament, which had expre&s;ly forbid Hamilton to act in concert with tho&s;e Engli&s;h who &s;hould refu&s;e to &s;ub&s;cribe the covenant. Lambert retired at their approach with &s;uch precipitation, that he mu&s;t have been entirely defeated had the duke pur&s;ued him in his retreat; but that nobleman, in&s;tead of taking the advantage of his di&s;order, loitered away &s;everal days at Carlile, then marched to Kendal in We&s;tmoreland, where he remained until he could no longer find &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for his army. For this rea&s;on he advanced with part of his forces into Lanca&s;hire, and fixed his head-quarters at Pre&s;ton.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="45" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XLV.</HEAD>
<P>Cromwell, having joined Lambert in York&s;hire, re&s;olved to &s;eek the enemy, though his troops did not amount to nine thou&s;and; and the&s;e were almo&s;t exhau&s;ted with fatigue. Sir Marmaduke Langdale, who&s;e divi&s;ion com|po&s;ed the duke's vanguard, &s;ent notice that Cromwell was at hand; and advi&s;ed his grace to contract the quarters, which were &s;cattered at great di&s;tances from each other. The duke per&s;uaded him&s;elf that it was no more than a detach|ment from Cromwell's army, and neglected the &s;alutary advice of the Engli&s;h officer, who was attacked by the enemy's hor&s;e; and, after a very ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, driven back to Pre&s;ton. The duke ordered him to advance again, and promi&s;ed that he &s;hould be &s;u&s;tained; but he did not perform his promi&s;e, and Langdale was entirely routed on the &s;ixteenth day of Augu&s;t. Then Cromwell's cavalry marched to Pre&s;ton, which they found in the utmo&s;t con|fu&s;ion, and took, after a &s;mart engagement. The duke retired to the other &s;ide<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell's Letter in Ru&s;hworth.</NOTE> of the bridge, at which he po&s;ted a &s;trong guard, that defended it ob&s;tinately for &s;ome time; but, at length, they were obliged to abandon it to the victors. The fugitives were, next day and the following, pur&s;ued to Warrington; after having made a &s;tand, and defended a defile for &s;everal hours: there Bailey, who commanded them, &s;urrendered with his men pri&s;oners of war. The duke
<PB N="336" REF="3380">
fled, with about three thou&s;and hor&s;e, to Utoxeter; but, Lambert being clo&s;e at his heels, he and all his officers fell into the hands of the enemy: while the broken cavaliers e&s;caped to Cumberland, where they joined major-general Monro. This officer had followed the duke of Hamilton with a reinforce|ment of hor&s;e and foot, and now retreated to his own country, without paying any regard to the remon&s;trances of the king's friends, who &s;ollicited him to join them, and make a &s;tand again&s;t the enemy. Cromwell, marching to the border, &s;ent a letter to the committee of the Scotti&s;h parliament, demanding that they would recall Monro, and deliver up Berwick; otherwi&s;e he would carry the war into their country. The face of affairs was now entirely changed in Scotland: Argyle's intere&s;t predominated, and he a&s;&s;embled a body of troops to oppo&s;e Monro, who had been, at his return, joined by the earl of Lanerk. They &s;eized Stirling, and hampered the marquis: but all their mea&s;ures were broken by Cromwell, who advanced to Edinburgh. The committee of danger abandoned that place, and the earl of Lanerk and Monro con&s;ented to an accommodation. Cromwell was received at Edinburgh with great &s;olemnity, by means of Argyle, with whom he cultivated an intimacy of friend&s;hip. Berwick and Carlile were delivered into his hands: at the de&s;ire of the Scots, he left Lambert with &s;ome regiments, to overawe the malignants of that country; and, having concerted mea&s;ures with the marquis, returned in tri|umph to England.</P>

<P>The royali&s;ts in Colche&s;ter had defended the place with &s;urpri&s;ing intrepidity and re&s;olution, until they were compelled by famine to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. Then the general &s;ullied his victory with an act of cruelty, which he was in&s;tigated to commit by the barbarous and blood-thir&s;ty Ireton. In a council of war it was re&s;olved, That Lucas, Li&s;le, and Ga&s;coign, &s;hould be put to death; but the life of Ga&s;coign was &s;pared, on account of his being a foreigner. When the other two were brought out to be &s;hot, Lucas gave the word to fire, as if he had been at the head of his own company. Li&s;le ki&s;&s;ed him eagerly after he was dead; and de&s;ired the executioners to come nearer. One of the &s;oldiers replying, "I'll warrant you &s;ir, we will hit you:" "Friends &s;aid he &s;miling I have been nearer you when you have mi&s;&s;ed me." So &s;aying, he received their &s;hot, and fell, lamented by all good men who had an opportunity to know the candour of his heart and the &s;weetne&s;s of his di&s;po|&s;ition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon.</NOTE> Ga&s;coign, who was a Florentine, having undre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to undergo the &s;ame fate, de&s;ired he might be indulged with pen, ink, and paper, to make the grand duke acquainted with the nature of his death, that his family &s;hould not be deprived of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and the council of wan, finding he was a foreigner, would not take away his life, le&s;t the grand duke of Tu&s;cany &s;hould make reta$$ation upon the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects in his dominions.</P>

<P>While the army was at a di&s;tance from London, and the Scots expected in England, the pre&s;byterian party prevailed in the two hou&s;es at We&s;tmin&s;ter: and the independents were fain to &s;ubmit. The common|council of the city pre&s;ented a petition, demanding that the chains for their &s;treets, and barricadoes, which had been taken from them, &s;hould be re&s;tored; and major-general Skippon commi&s;&s;ioned to command the forces in London. Their demands were immediately granted. The hou&s;e of commons, having deliberated upon the form of government to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, voted that the
<PB N="337" REF="3390">
nation &s;hould be governed by a king and two hou&s;es of parliament: That the propo&s;als &s;ent to the king at Hampton-court, &s;hould &s;erve as a foundation for the government: and, That each member might freely &s;peak his &s;entiments with re&s;pect to his maje&s;ty. The parliament received another petition from the mayor and common-council, de&s;iring, That they &s;hould be authorized to e&s;ta|bli&s;h their own militia: and, That the command of the Tower &s;hould be con|ferred on a per&s;on recommended by them to the two hou&s;es. The parliament complied with the&s;e reque&s;ts; and the citizens began to prepare for action. On the fifth day of May, the commons publi&s;hed a declaration, importing, That they would maintain the covenant, and join the Scots in treating with his ma|je&s;ty. The inhabitants of Surry repairing to We&s;tmin&s;ter in great numbers, petitioned the two hou&s;es, That the king &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in all his rights and prerogatives; and the troops di&s;banded. They committed &s;uch violence upon the guards of the parliament, that recour&s;e was had to a detachment of hor&s;e and foot quartered in the Mews and Whitehall, who attacked and di&s;per&s;ed them, after having killed and wounded a great number. Such ra&s;h, incon&s;ide|rate conduct was prejudicial to the king's affairs. The pre&s;byterians began to &s;u&s;pect, that their intention was to re&s;tore the king, without conditions; and therefore they kept aloof when the cavaliers took arms in different parts of the kingdom.</P>

<P>Embarra&s;&s;ed between the royali&s;ts and independents, and equally afraid of the &s;ucce&s;s of either, they re&s;olved to conclude a peace with the king, during the ab&s;ence of the army. In &s;pite of the oppo&s;ition of the independents, the two hou&s;es voted, That after the king &s;hould have &s;igned three bills to be pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, they would treat with him upon the re&s;t of the propo|fals to which the two kingdoms had agreed. The&s;e three bills related to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the militia, the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline, and the revocation of the declarations which had been publi&s;hed again&s;t the parliament. The com|mons ordained, that the eleven members of their hou&s;e, and the lords who had been accu&s;ed by the army, &s;hould be acquitted of all imputation; they re&s;tored Glyn, the member for We&s;tmin&s;ter, who had been expelled; and forbade all per&s;ons, on pain of death, to take arms without their authority. On the twenty|&s;ixth day of June, they appointed a committee to con&s;ider of means to treat with his maje&s;ty. The mayor, aldermen, and common-council, petitioned, that a per&s;onal treaty &s;hould be &s;et on foot with his maje&s;ty; and the Scots invited to concur with them in their endeavours after peace. The commencement of this negotiation was retarded by di&s;putes between the lords and commons. The ad|vice of the committee was, that they &s;hould annul the vote by which they had prohibited addre&s;&s;es to the king: that they &s;hould not in&s;i&s;t upon the three bills as preliminary; but remove his maje&s;ty to one of his hou&s;es in the neighbour|hood of London. The lords approved of this advice; but the commons re|fu&s;ed to treat, except upon the three previous conditions. The city of London concurred with the upper hou&s;e, in &s;everal petitions, and &s;eemed to threaten the commons with more violent mea&s;ures. The&s;e, on the other hand, employed Skippon to enli&s;t &s;oldiers for a guard, on pretence of apprehending the de&s;igns of the cavaliers, who at that time &s;warmed in London; and the independents employed all their arts to foment this divi&s;ion.</P>

<P>At length, the commons con&s;ented to wave the three preliminary bills; but, fifty days elap&s;ed before they could agree upon the manner, time, and place of the treaty; and in that interval, the Scots and all the royali&s;ts were over|thrown: &s;o that the pre&s;byterians became more fearful, and the independent in|tere&s;t revived in the two hou&s;es. Neverthele&s;s, they re&s;olved to proceed with the treaty; and &s;ignified their re&s;olution to the king. In compliance with his demands, the upper hou&s;e voted, That the probibition to addre&s;s him &s;hould be annulled: That tho&s;e who&s;e attendance and advice his maje&s;ty required, &s;hould be with him; and that he &s;hould be re&s;tored to the &s;ame liberty he had enjoyed at Hampton-court: That the treaty &s;hould be carried on in the town of Newport; and the Scots be invited to &s;end thither their commi&s;&s;ioners: That five lords and ten commoners &s;hould be appointed as commi&s;&s;ioners from the Engli&s;h parliament. The commons objected to the article of inviting the Scots; but agreed, that they might &s;end deputies of their own accord, or in con&s;equence of the king's invitation. They drew up in&s;tructions to colonel Hammond, touching his conducting the king to Newport; and in&s;i&s;ted upon his maje&s;ty's promi&s;ing, upon his royal word, that he would not leave the I&s;le of Wight, during the conferences, nor for twenty eight days after they &s;hould be fini&s;hed. Mean while, petitions were delivered to the parliament, by the city of London, demanding, that the king &s;hould be &s;et at liberty, and invited to a per&s;onal treaty: another to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, was pre&s;ented by the of|ficers who had been reduced; but, when the news of Cromwell's victory ar|rived, the independents produced a petition, &s;igned by many thou&s;ands, taxing the commons with corruption; di&s;approving of a treaty with the king; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ru$hwor$h.</NOTE> propo&s;ing the model of a &s;ort of republican government. This addre&s;s was &s;econded by another, in the name of the &s;hip-ma&s;ters; but, the parliament did not think this was a proper conjuncture to irritate them further, by an&s;wering their reproaches: neverthele&s;s, they per&s;i&s;ted in their re&s;olution to treat, and their commi&s;&s;ioners &s;et out for the I&s;le of Wight.</P>

<P>They were &s;upri&s;ed at the manife&s;t change that appeared in their haple&s;s &s;overeign. When he was bere$t of his &s;ervants, and cut off from all human com|munication, he laid a&s;ide all care of his per&s;on. He had allowed his beard to grow; his hair, which being di&s;hevelled and neglected, was now almo&s;t totally &s;ilvered by the hand of time, or the pre&s;&s;ure of anxiety; and his apparel bore the marks of misfortune and decay. Thus he &s;tood a venerable figure of ma|je&s;ty and di&s;tre&s;s, which even his adver&s;aries could not behold without reverence and compa&s;&s;ion. Though his exteriors were altered, his mind was &s;erene; he received them with a chearful a&s;pect; and, in the cour&s;e of the conferences, di&s;|covered an amazing extent of under&s;tanding. The earl of Sali&s;bury, &s;urpri&s;ed at the&s;e in&s;tances of uncommon capacity, &s;aid to Sir Philip Warwick, <Q>&startq;The king is extremely improved of late!&endq;</Q> <Q>&startq;He was always &s;o, (replied the other) but now, at la&s;t, you are &s;en&s;ible of it.&endq;</Q> Sir Henry Vane in&s;i&s;ted upon their being rigid and circum&s;pect in propo&s;ing terms of accommodation, on account of the king's uncommon abilities. He freely agreed to recal the declarations which had been publi&s;hed again&s;t the parliament; but, it was not without great reluctance, that he con&s;ented to acknowledge they had taken arms in their own defence. He &s;urrendered to the parliament the whole power of the militia, and that of levying money for its &s;upport, during the term of twenty years; nay,
<PB N="339" REF="3410">
even that of re&s;uming the &s;ame authority, at any time after the expiration of that term, when they &s;hould declare &s;uch a &s;tep nece&s;&s;ary for the public &s;afety. With re&s;pect to religion, he &s;aid his con&s;cience would not permit him to con&s;ent to the abolition of epi&s;copacy, which he firmly believed was of apo&s;tolical in&s;titution; and as to the &s;ale of the church-lands, he deemed it not only &s;acrilegious, but expre&s;sly contrary to his coronation oath, by which he was bound to maintain the rights of the clergy; neverthele&s;s, to convince them of his eager de&s;ire after peace, he would con&s;ent to their reducing epi&s;copacy to its primitive u&s;e: that archbi&s;hops, deans, and chapters, &s;hould be aboli&s;hed: that the pre&s;byterian form of di&s;cipline &s;hould continue for three years, during which the king and parlia|ment, with the advice of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical a&s;&s;embly, and other divines named by his maje&s;ty, &s;hould agree upon &s;ome &s;uitable plan of church-government. He yielded up the queen's privilege of having ma&s;s celebrated in her own chapel: he was willing that the chapter-lands &s;hould be let at low lea&s;es for ninety-nine years: he gave up the book of Common-prayer, with the provi&s;o, that he might u&s;e &s;ome other liturgy in his own exerci&s;es of devotion: he re&s;igned the whole management of the Iri&s;h war to the two hou&s;es: he promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to an act for rai&s;ing money to di&s;charge the public debts: he &s;ubmitted to the par|liament's demand of &s;elling all the great offices for twenty years, as well as to the abolition of the court of wards, on condition, that he and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;hould, in lieu of it, receive the annual &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and pounds: he ac|knowledged their great &s;eal, and re&s;igned his own, together with the power of creating peers without the con&s;ent of the two hou&s;es: he con&s;ented to their ob|liging the royali&s;ts to compound for their e&s;tates; but, when they demanded a bill of attainder again&s;t the marquis of Newca&s;tle, lord Digby, lord Byron, Sir Marmaduke Langdale, Sir Richard Greenvill, Sir Francis Doddington, and judge Jenkins, he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to &s;acrifice his be&s;t friends to their ven|geance, though he would have yielded to their bani&s;hment for a limited time. He continually upbraided him&s;elf with his tame conde&s;cen&s;ion in giving up the earl of Strafford to the rage of an implacable faction; and his ideas of grati|tude and friend&s;hip had been corroborated by the reflections that occurred to him in his &s;olitary confinement. Though he had now almo&s;t wholly dive&s;ted him|&s;elf of his royalty, to plea&s;e the arrogance of an u&s;urping parliament, the two hou&s;es having con&s;idered his an&s;wers and conce&s;&s;ions, voted them un&s;atisfactory on the articles of epi&s;copacy, popery, the covenant, the &s;ale of church-lands, and delinquents. The term of the conferences was prolonged; and the parlia|ment demanded a final an&s;wer of his maje&s;ty. To make a parade of their in|dulgence, they voted, That he might return with honour, liberty, and fafety to London: and, That he &s;hould be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his lawful revenues, as &s;oon as he &s;hould have &s;ub&s;cribed to all their propo&s;itions. What was this but a cruel mockery of in&s;olence and deceit. They profe&s;&s;ed to treat with their &s;overeign, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his complying with all their demands. No per&s;on of &s;enti|ment and candour can reflect upon the pride and ob&s;tinacy of tho&s;e plebeians, without indignation.</P>

<P>While the king and the two hou&s;es were engaged in this negotiation, the officers of the army endeavoured to &s;tart new ob&s;tacles to a pacification. The king's party having &s;urpri&s;ed the ca&s;tle of Pontefract in York&s;hire, colonel Rain&s;borough was &s;ent to be&s;iege the place, and lo&s;t his life in a &s;truggle with a

party of the garri&s;on, which endeavoured to carry him off by &s;tratagem. He was a de&s;perate tool of Cromwell, who therefore re&s;olved to revenge his death, and inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle with &s;ome of the troops from Scotland. In the mean time, he &s;ent a &s;trong detachment forwards to join Fairfax, who&s;e head-quarters were at Wind&s;or. The officers thus reinforced, drew up a remon&s;trance, and pre&s;ented it to parliament. They demanded, that the king &s;hould be brought to ju&s;tice, as the author of all the blood&s;hed and evils with which the kingdom had been afflicted: that the prince of Wales and the duke of York &s;hould be proclaimed traitors, and bani&s;hed for ever, unle&s;s they &s;hould &s;ubmit within a certain limited time: that the revenues of the crown &s;hould be &s;eque&s;tered for public u&s;es: that a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of parliaments &s;hould be &s;ecured on &s;ome &s;ettled plan: that, for the future, no king &s;hould be owned but by the election of parliament, and after the per&s;on &s;o elected &s;hould have expre&s;sly re|nounced his negative voice again&s;t the re&s;olutions of the commons. Ad|dre&s;&s;es of the &s;ame kind were received from a number of the inhabitants and &s;hipma&s;ters of London, from the neighbourhood of Oxford, the town of New|ca&s;tle, the county of York, and different bodies of the army. The general re|called Hammond, and &s;ent colonel Eure to take the king into clo&s;e cu&s;tody. The commons complained of this change, and ordered the general to continue Hammond in his command; but, in&s;tead of obeying their mandate, he directed Eure to remove his maje&s;ty to the ca&s;tle of Hur&s;t in Hamp&s;hire, oppo&s;ite to the I&s;le of Wight. He ju&s;tified this &s;tep by a declaration, in which the army taxed the majority of the members with corruption, and exhorted tho&s;e who had good intentions, to prote&s;t again&s;t the re&s;olutions of the two hou&s;es, and retire; in which ca&s;e, the army would acknowledge and obey them as the legal parliament.</P>

<P>On the fir&s;t day of December, the general wrote a letter to the city of London, intimating that he was on his march for that capital, on account of the contempt with which the parliament had treated the remon&s;trance. He prote&s;ted he had no fini&s;ter de&s;ign again&s;t the city: but, de&s;ired the magi&s;trates would &s;upply him with forty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, in eight and forty hours.<NOTE PLACE="marg">R$&s;hworth.</NOTE> The commons a&s;&s;ented to the reque&s;t, though the money was not &s;ent; and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon.</NOTE> general was intreated to advance no nearer to London. While the hou&s;e was employed in examining the king's offers, the general arrived with &s;everal regiments, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of We&s;tmin&s;ter. On the fourth day of the month, the hou&s;e of commons receiving intelligence that the king was conveyed to Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle, voted, That his maje&s;ty had been removed with|out their con&s;ent: then they re&s;olved, That the king's conce&s;&s;ions might &s;erve as a foundation for peace. After this vote, they appointed a committee to treat with the general, about re&s;toring a good under&s;tanding between the parliament and the army. On the &s;ixth day of the month, Fairfax di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the militia of London, which for &s;everal months had &s;erved as a guard to the two hou&s;es; and ordered his &s;oldiers to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the avenues to We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. Forty-one members going to the lower hou&s;e, did they arre&s;t, and confine in a neighbourng hou&s;e; and when the &s;peaker &s;ent thither the &s;erjeant to &s;ummon tho&s;e members to their places, the officer who guarded them, told him he knew no orders &s;uperior to tho&s;e he obeyed. Colonel Whalley, accompanied by &s;everal officers, repaired to the hou&s;e of commons, and pre&s;ented a writing, intituled,
<PB N="341" REF="3430">
"Propo&s;itions and demands of the army for its ju&s;tification." They charged the inva&s;ion of the Scots, and all the ob&s;tacles which had hindered the re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of peace, upon major-general Brown, and ninety members of the hou&s;e, whom they named, and who&s;e immediate expul&s;ion they demanded. On the &s;eventh day of December, the commons, in going to the hou&s;e, found a &s;trong guard on both &s;ides of the door, by which tho&s;e ninety members were denied admittance.</P>

<P>The pre&s;byterians being thus excluded, the hou&s;e became wholly inde|pendent; and Cromwell taking his &s;eat, was thanked for his great &s;ervices. The general detached three regiments into the city, and &s;eized twenty thou&s;and pounds belonging to the merchants. The excluded members having publi&s;hed a prote&s;tation again&s;t the violence they had undergone, the two hou&s;es declared it &s;candalous and &s;editious; then they ordained, that in the en&s;uing election for the magi&s;tracy of London, no per&s;on &s;hould be cho&s;en mayor, or common|council man, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted the king again&s;t the parliament, either in the fir&s;t or &s;econd war; who had coutenanced the tumults in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, or the in&s;urrections in Kent, E&s;&s;ex, Middle&s;ex, or Surry. On the twentieth day of December, the general relea&s;ed &s;ixteen of the impri&s;oned members, who were allowed to re&s;ume their places in parliament. The &s;mall number of peers who &s;at in the upper hou&s;e, unable to &s;tem the torrent, thought proper to acquie&s;ce in the mea&s;ures of the victorious party. Petitions were now pre&s;ented again&s;t the king, by the &s;oldiers of Lambert's army, and the counties of Somer&s;et and Norfolk; and the fleet under the earl of Warwick &s;ent a declaration, in which it concurred with the army's remon&s;trance.</P>

<P>At length, this bold remnant of the hou&s;e of commons, pre&s;umed to form a re&s;olution which far tran&s;cended all former acts of trea&s;on and fana|tici&s;m. They appointed a committee to draw up a formal accu&s;ation or im|peachment of his maje&s;ty. Colonel Harri&s;on, the &s;on of a butcher, was com|manded to conduct the king from Hur&s;t-ca&s;tle to Wind&s;or. On the road he was permitted to dine at the hou&s;e of lord Newburgh, who had previou&s;ly con|trived a &s;cheme for his e&s;cape, by means of a fleet cour&s;er provided for that purpo&s;e; but, before the king arrived the bea&s;t was lamed by the kick of another hor&s;e. The duke of Hamilton, who was confined at Wind&s;or, being admitted into the pre&s;ence of his &s;overeign, ran towards him with all the eagerne&s;s of affec|tion, and fell upon his knees, exclaiming, "My dear ma&s;ter!" The unhappy monarch rai&s;ed him up, and embracing him tenderly, replied, while the tears ran down his cheeks, "I have indeed been a dear ma&s;ter to you." The king was in&s;tantly hurried away, and the duke weeping bitterly, foretold that this was the la&s;t time he &s;hould &s;ee his per&s;ecuted prince. Such was the fortitude and re&s;ignation of Charles, that all his own misfortunes never co&s;t him one tear; but, he could not &s;ee unmoved, the ruin of his adherents. Immediately after the deplorable fate of the gallant Sir Charles Lucas, a relation of that gentle|man appearing before the king, in a mourning habit, his maje&s;ty recollected the occa&s;ion, and &s;hed a flood of tears as a tribute to the memory of the decea&s;ed. When Charles arrived at Wind&s;or, the council of war ordained, that he &s;hould be no longer treated as a &s;overeign. All ceremony was laid a&s;ide: he &s;aw him|&s;elf deprived of his &s;ervants, and expo&s;ed to every in&s;ult of contemptuous fami|liarity. The&s;e were &s;evere mortifications, which, however, he bore without re|pining.
<PB N="342" REF="3440">
He could not believe his adver&s;aries would pre&s;ume to bring him to a formal trial; but, for &s;ome time, he nightly expected the private &s;troke of a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ination, until he was undeceived by Harri&s;on, who a&s;&s;ured him, that his fate would be as public as the &s;un at noon.</P>

<P>On the twenty-eighth day of December, the commons having con&s;idered the report of their committee, pa&s;&s;ed an act for erecting a high-court of ju&s;tice, impowered to try the king, by the name of Charles Stuart, for having formed the dete&s;table de&s;ign to overthrow the fundamental laws and liberties of the na|tion, and introduce an arbitrary and tyrannical government: for having waged a cruel war upon his parliament, by which the kingdom had been mi&s;erably ravaged, the public trea&s;ure exhau&s;ted, commerce intirely ruined, many thou|&s;ands of people de&s;troyed, and an infinite number of evils produced. Thomas lord Fairfax, Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton, Sir Hardre&s;s Waller, Philip Skippon, and other per&s;ons, to the number of one hundred and forty-five, were appointed commi&s;&s;ioners and judges, on this &s;urpri&s;ing trial. The ordinance for impeaching the king being &s;ent to the upper hou&s;e, was unanimou&s;ly rejected by &s;ixteen peers, who in&s;tantly adjourned for ten days: the lower hou&s;e imme|diately voted, That the members of their hou&s;e, and the other commi&s;&s;ioners nominated as judges on the king, might execute the commi&s;&s;ion, although the lords had rejected the ordinance. At the &s;ame time, they erazed from the com|mi&s;&s;ion, the names of &s;ix peers who had been appointed among the judges, and in&s;erted others. Among the&s;e was Brad&s;haw, a practitioner of the law, whom they afterwards elected pre&s;ident of their high-court of ju&s;tice. This mea&s;ure being taken, they voted, That the &s;overeign power re&s;ided originally in the peo|ple: That the authority of the nation was in the hands of the commons of England, a&s;&s;embled in parliament as repre&s;entatives of the people: and, That what&s;oever the commons declared to be law, had the force of a &s;tatute, without the a&s;&s;ent of king or peers. From the &s;ixth to the twentieth day of January, the time was employed in making preparations for this a&s;toni&s;hing trial, which pa&s;&s;ed in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. On the &s;ixth day of January, the Scotti&s;h commi&s;|&s;ioners re&s;ident at London, in a letter to parliament, pre&s;&s;ed for unity of coun|cils and actions between the two nations, according to the covenant; and de&s;ired that the hou&s;e would not proceed to try the king until the opinion of Scotland &s;hould be known.</P>

<P>Coke being cho&s;en &s;ollicitor-general for the trial, and Dori&s;laus and A&s;ke appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t in managing and drawing up the charge again&s;t the king, the court of ju&s;tice heard the charge, and appointed a committee to pe|ru&s;e the proofs. On the fir&s;t day of the trial, the crier of the court called over the names of the commi&s;&s;ioners; and nobody an&s;wering for lord Fairfax, his name was repeated, when a female voice from the gallery exclaimed, <Q>&startq;He has more wit than to be here.&endq;</Q> When the impeachment was read <Q>&startq;In the name of all the good people of England,&endq;</Q> <Q>&startq;No, (replied the &s;ame voice in a &s;hriller tone) nor the twentieth part of them.&endq;</Q> One of the officers ordered a file of mu&s;queteers to fire at the place from whence this an&s;wer proceeded; but, they &s;oon di&s;covered that the per&s;on who &s;poke was the lady Fairfax, whom they per&s;uaded to retire. The king being brought from Wind&s;or to St. James's, was next day produced before the high-court in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, having been guarded thither by colonel Hacker, and about thirty officers armed with parti|zans.
<PB N="344" REF="3450">
He was met at the gate by the mace of the court, and conducted to a chair placed within the bar, on which he &s;at down without moving his hat; and, with an air of dignified di&s;dain &s;urveyed the members of the court, who were likewi&s;e covered. The pre&s;ident Brad&s;haw gave him to under&s;tand, he was brought thither to be tried, upon a charge again&s;t him by the commons of Eng|land. His maje&s;ty made a motion to &s;peak, but was interrupted. When he heard the charge, accu&s;ing him as author of all the blood that had been &s;hed during the war, he &s;miled at their in&s;olence; and demanded by what authority he was brought to &s;uch a trial? Brad&s;haw replying, <Q>&startq;In the name of the commons of England;&endq;</Q> he ob&s;erved, that without the king and the lords, there could be no parliament; that the kingdom of England was hereditary; and, that with|out being convinced of their having lawful authority, he &s;hould betray his tru&s;t in an&s;wering the articles of his impeachment. Having been &s;ummoned to an|&s;wer &s;everal times, and refu&s;ing as often, he was remanded to St. James's; and the court adjourned. On the twenty-&s;econd day of January, the Scotti&s;h com|mi&s;&s;ioners delivered &s;ome papers to the hou&s;e, declaring, That Scotland had an undoubted intere&s;t in the per&s;on of the king: That he was not delivered to the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners at Newca&s;tle for the ruin of his per&s;on; but for a &s;pee|dier &s;ettlement of the peace of his kingdom. They di&s;&s;ented extremely from the pre&s;ent way of proceeding again&s;t him, which, they &s;aid, left a deep impre&s;|&s;ion on their hearts, and &s;at heavy on their &s;pirits, in regard of the great mi&s;e|ries that were like to en&s;ue upon the kingdoms; and they moved for leave of the hou&s;e, to make their per&s;onal addre&s;&s;es to his maje&s;ty: papers of the &s;ame nature they likewi&s;e pre&s;ented to the lord-general. At the &s;econd &s;itting of the high-court, the pre&s;ident required the king to an&s;wer to the charge of high|trea&s;on which had been brought again&s;t him. His maje&s;ty again demurred to the legality of the court; ob&s;erved, that the commons of England never con&s;tituted a court of judicature; challenged Brad&s;haw to produce one prece|dent; and offered to give his rea&s;ons for conceiving, that he could not, in con|&s;cience and duty, &s;ubmit to their authority. But, he was interrupted by the pre&s;ident, and reconveyed to his lodgings. At his third appearance, he conti|nued firm to his purpo&s;e; refu&s;ed to put in any particular an&s;wer until he &s;hould be convinced that their proceedings were not contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom: he told them they had made their king a pri&s;oner, while he was in treaty, on the public faith of the kingdom: and, that he was willing to give &s;atisfaction to his people; but, not as a criminal before a court of judi|cature, which could have no legal authority.

<P>Their next &s;tep was to publi&s;h the charge again&s;t his maje&s;ty. On the twenty-&s;eventh day of the month, the high-court &s;at in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall; and the king in going thither was in&s;ulted by the &s;oldiers, and the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of the populace, who exclaimed, "Ju&s;tice, ju&s;tice! execution, execution!" He appeared undaunted as before, with his hat on; and de&s;ired, that as he had &s;omething to &s;ay that might nearly concern the peace of the kingdom, and the liberty of the &s;ubject, he might be heard before the lords and commons in the Painted-chamber. His judges withdrew into the court of wards, where many
<PB N="344" REF="3460">
members of their court were of opinion that they &s;hould comply with the king's de&s;ire. When they were over-ruled by the majority, colonel Harvey and &s;ome others went away in di&s;content, and would never afterwards &s;it with the re&s;t of the commi&s;&s;ioners. The king's propo&s;al being rejected, he declared he had nothing el&s;e to &s;ay. Had he been indulged in this reque&s;t, it was thought he would have propo&s;ed a re&s;ignation of the crown in favour of the prince of Wales. The pre&s;ident now expatiated upon his mi&s;government; and endea|voured to prove by argument, and in&s;tances from hi&s;tory, that kings were ac|countable to their people. Then he commanded the clerk to read the &s;entence, reciting the charge of trea&s;ons and crimes, for which the court did adjudge, That he, the &s;aid Charles Stuart, as a tyrant, traytor, murderer, and public enemy, &s;hould be put to death, by &s;evering his head from his body. He di&s;covered no &s;igns of emotion at this unheard-of outrage again&s;t ju&s;tice, humanity, and de|corum; but, again de&s;ired a hearing, which was refu&s;ed. In walking through the hall from this execrable tribunal, the &s;oldiers and rabble, in&s;tigated by their &s;uperiors, renewed the cry of "Ju&s;tice and execution." They reviled and &s;coffed at him in the mo&s;t bitter and taunting expre&s;&s;ions: they blew into his face the &s;moke of tobacco, which was particularly offen&s;ive to his organs; and one mi&s;creant even pre&s;umed to &s;pit in the face of his anointed &s;overeign. The&s;e in&s;ults he bore with the patience and piety of a primitive martyr. He &s;miled at their rancour: <Q>&startq;Poor &s;ouls! (&s;aid he$ for a little money they would treat their commanders in the &s;ame manner:&endq;</Q> and he poured forth ejaculations to heaven in favour of his adver&s;aries. Tho&s;e of the populace who &s;till retained the feelings of humanity, expre&s;&s;ed their &s;orrow in &s;ighs and tears. A &s;oldier melting at the &s;ight of fallen maje&s;ty, could not help imploring aloud, the ble&s;|&s;ing o$ heaven upon his royal head. An officer overhearing his petition, &s;truck him to the ground in pre&s;ence of the haple&s;s monarch, who &s;aid, <Q>&startq;The puni&s;h|ment, me$hinks, exceeds the offence.&endq;</Q> At his return to Whitehall, he de&s;ired permi&s;&s;$on of the hou&s;e to &s;ee his children, and be attended in his private devo|tion by doctor Juxon, late bi&s;hop of London; and both the&s;e reque&s;ts were granted, though he was expo&s;ed to the impertinent exhortations of Hugh Pe|ters the furious fanatical preacher.</P>

<P>The de&s;ign of trying a king as a malefactor before a court of ju|dicature, con&s;tituted of his own &s;ubjects, was looked upon with horror by every nation on the continent. Though the French mini&s;try was di&s;tracted, and that kingdom involved in a civil war, their amba&s;&s;ador in England was or|dered to interpo&s;e in the king's behalf. The Dutch al&s;o employed their good offices, though in a very cold, phlegmatic manner. The Scots exclaimed, preach$d, and prote&s;ted, again&s;t the violence offered to maje&s;ty. Pathetic let|ters were wri$$$n to the parliament by the queen and the prince of Wales. The duke of Richmond, the earls of Hertford, Southampton, and Linde&s;ey, pre|&s;$n$ed a r$mon$trance to the commons, importing, that as they were the king's c$un$ellors$ an$ had advi&s;ed all tho&s;e mea&s;ures now imputed as crimes to their &s;overe$gn, th$y only $ere guilty; and offered them&s;elves as &s;acrifices to the $afety of th$$r prince. This generous interpo&s;ition in favour of their haple&s;s ma$$$r, w$ich r$f$ects ete$nal honour on their names, produced no effect upon the $ommons; an$ the high-court of j$$tice appointed the thirtieth day of January, for $word$ $$ng's execu$i$$.</P>

<P>During this &s;hort interval of three days between his &s;entence and his death, he had a very tender interview with his two haple&s;s children, the prince&s;s Elizabeth, and the duke of Glouce&s;ter, who were brought to him from Sion hou&s;e. This la&s;t was an infant; but the prince&s;s, though a child, expre&s;&s;ed a deep &s;en&s;e of the misfortunes to which her family was expo&s;ed. The fond parent now wept over his orphan offspring, while he cla&s;ped them in his pa|ternal embrace. He enriched his daughter with &s;en&s;ible advice and pious ex|hortations. He charged her to tell the queen, that he had never, not even in thought, &s;werved from his fidelity towards her; and that his conjugal affection &s;hould not terminate but with his life. He gave her two &s;eals adorned with jewels, the only wealth that now remained to this ill-fated monarch. He im|plored heaven to &s;hower down ble&s;&s;ings on the&s;e forlorn babes and the re&s;t of his children; and, taking leave of them in the mo&s;t affecting manner, re&s;igned him&s;elf to his fate. This la&s;t &s;truggle of nature being pa&s;&s;ed, he prepared him&s;elf for death with the mo&s;t &s;erene tranquillity. The greatne&s;s of this dreadful tran&s;action overwhelmed the people with fear and a&s;toni&s;hment: they waited in &s;ilent horror, as if they expected the di&s;&s;olution of nature. The fa|natici&s;m of the &s;oldiers was wrought up to the highe&s;t pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;tic frenzy by &s;ermons, exhortations, and prayer. Fairfax, who exerted all his in|fluence to avert the execution of the &s;entence, was plyed with this religious ar|tifice: Cromwell and Ireton a&s;&s;ured him that the Lord had rejected the king; and exhorted him to &s;eek by prayer &s;ome direction from heaven. Harri&s;on was employed to join with him in his exerci&s;es of devotion, which he prolonged in prayer, p&s;alms, and lamentations, until the fatal &s;troke was over.</P>

<P>The warrant for executing the king was now granted by the high court of ju&s;tice, and pious Charles longed for his deliverance. On the thirtieth day of January he was conducted on foot through St. James's park to White|hall, accompanied by doctor Juxon, and guarded by a regiment of foot, under the command of colonel Tomlin&s;on. He had taken the &s;acrament in the morning. He continued at his devotion in Whitehall till noon, when he drank a gla&s;s of wine, and ate a mor&s;el of bread. Then he went through the Ban|quetting-Hou&s;e to the &s;caffold erected adjoining to that edifice. It was covered with black cloth: on the middle of it appeared the block and ax, with two executioners in vizors; &s;everal troops of hor&s;e and companies of foot were drawn up on each &s;ide, and the place was &s;urrounded by a multitude of &s;pectators. The king eyed the implements of death with great compo&s;ure, and a&s;ked if there was not a higher block. Then, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to colonels Tomlin&s;on, Hacker, and &s;ome other per&s;ons who were on the &s;caffold, he declared him|&s;elf innocent of having commenced the war again&s;t his parliament. He owned that his fate was a ju&s;t judgment from heaven, for having con&s;ented to the execution of an unju&s;t &s;entence upon the earl of Strafford. He forgave all his enemies, exhorted the people to return to their obedience, and acknowledge his &s;ucce&s;&s;or as their lawful &s;overeign; and &s;ignified his inviolable attachment to the prote&s;tant religion, as profe&s;&s;ed in the church of England. While he pre|pared him&s;elf for the block, doctor Juxon told him, there was but one &s;tage more; which, though trouble&s;ome, was &s;hort, and would convey him to heaven, where he &s;hould find ineffable joy and comfort. <Q>&startq;I go (&s;aid the king) from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown, where no di&s;turbance

One of the men in vizors &s;evered his head from his body at one blow; and the other, holding it up &s;treaming with blood, exclaimed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$dlow. R$$hworth, Whi$$lock. C$$r$ndon.</NOTE> "This is the head of a traitor." The &s;pectators te&s;tified their &s;orrow in &s;ighs, $ears, and lamentations; and great numbers attempted to dip their handker|chiefs in the blood of this murdered prince, which they con&s;idered as the precious relics of a ble&s;&s;ed martyr. Such were the impre&s;&s;ions of grief and horror made by this melancholy &s;pectacle, that &s;ome pregnant women lo&s;t the fruit of their wombs; others were &s;eized with convul&s;ions; and many fell into violent di&s;tempers that conveyed them to their graves. The very pul|pits, that u&s;ed to resound with in&s;olence and &s;edition, were now bedewed with the tears of real &s;orrow and contrition; and the people, in general, con|ceived an abhorrence and dete&s;tation of tho&s;e execrable hypocrites, who, under the ma&s;k of &s;anctity, performed a deed, which hath fixed an indelible &s;tain upon the character of the nation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the people in general were afflicted and in$$$ied at the execution of the king, appeared from the eagerne&s;s with which they bought up the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of the work, intit$led, Icon B$$ilike, a collection of the prayers and medita|tions of the king in the exerci&s;e of his private devotion and reflection. The &s;tile of this book is &s;trong, elegant, and per&s;picuous; and it abounds with &s;uch manly &s;entiments of piety and good|&s;en&s;e, as reflect unfading honour upon the memory of the royal author. His enemies, not contented with having deprived him of life, endeavoured to rob him of the reputation of having written this performance, which they a&s;cribed to Dr. Gawden; but the Icon is &s;o much &s;uperior in &s;tyle, matter, and compo&s;ition, to all the other productions of this author, that every reader of di&s;cernment mu&s;t perceive the ab&s;urdity of the imputation. Charles was very liberal to the cele|brated Flemi&s;h painter, Sir Peter-Paul Rubons, by who&s;e advice he purcha&s;ed the cartoons of Raphael, which are now in the palace of Hamp|ton-court; together with many excellent pieces of painting from foreign countries. He likewi&s;e care&s;&s;ed Vandyke, who was the pupil of Rubens, and even be&s;towed upon him his own kin&s;woman in marriage. His architect was the famous Inigo Jones, an arti&s;t who far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all his cotem|poraries, and left many monuments of his inimi|table genius, that &s;till remain in England. Laws, the mu&s;ician, was a particular favourite with Charles, who u&s;ed to call him the father of mu&s;ic. He be&s;towed particular marks of favour upon the renowned Harvey, who, to the eternal honour of the Engli&s;h nation, di&s;covered the circulation of the blood, from his own &s;agacity a&s;&s;i$ted by ex|periments. It mu&s;t be allowed that this prince was a judge of literary merit, and yet he &s;eems to have been void of ta&s;te for poetry and the drama. Sir John Suckling was the only poet that enjoyed any degree of countenance in the court of Charles; and that he owed not &s;o much to his poetical talents, as to his family and connexions. He en|tirely overlooked the merit of Ben John&s;on, until he was reduced to extreme poverty in his old age; and then the king &s;ent him ten pounds in charity. Ben was &s;hocked at the pitiful pre&s;ent, which, however, his nece&s;&s;ities obliged him to receive; but he could not help giving way to the dictates of his &s;pleen. <Q>&startq;The king (&s;aid he to the me&s;|&s;enger) &s;ends me ten pounds, becau&s;e he hears I lodge in a blind alley; but, from the nar|rowne&s;s of his bounty, I perceive his &s;oul lodges in a blind alley.&endq;</Q> Charles, con&s;idering the narrowne&s;s of his revenue, lived with great magnificence, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed four and twenty pa|laces, elegantly and completely furni&s;hed.

<P>Such was the unworthy and unexampled fate of Charles I. king of England, who fell a &s;acrifice to the mo&s;t atrocious in&s;olence of trea&s;on, in the forty-ninth year of his age, and in the twenty-fourth of his reign. He was a prince of a middling &s;tature, robu&s;t, and well proportioned. His hair was of a dark colour, his forehead high, his complexion pale, his vi&s;age long, and his a&s;pect melancholy. He excelled in riding and other manly exerci&s;es: he inherited a good under&s;tanding from nature, and had cultivated it with great a&s;&s;iduity. His perception was clear and acute, his judgment &s;olid and deci&s;ive; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a refined ta&s;te for the liberal arts, and was a munificent patron to tho&s;e who excelled in painting, &s;culpture, mu&s;ic, and architecture. In his private morals he was altogether unblemi&s;hed and exemplary. He was merciful, mode&s;t, cha&s;te, temperate, religious, per&s;onally brave; and we may join the noble hi&s;torian in &s;aying, <Q>&startq;He was the worthie&s;t gentleman, the be&s;t ma&s;ter, the be&s;t friend, the be&s;t hu&s;band, the be&s;t father, and the be&s;t chri&s;tian of the age in which he lived.&endq;</Q> He had the misfortune to be bred up in high notions of the prerogative, which he thought his honour and his duty obliged him to maintain. He lived at a time when the &s;pirit of the people became too mighty for tho&s;e re&s;traints which the regal power derived from the con&s;titution; and when the tide of fanatici&s;m began to overbear the religion of his country, to which he was con&s;cientiou&s;ly devoted. He &s;uffered him&s;elf to be guided by coun&s;ellors who were not only inferior to him&s;elf in knowledge and judgment; but generally proud, partial, and inflexible: and, from an exce&s;s of conjugal affection that bordered upon weakne&s;s, he payed too much deference to the advice and de&s;ires of his con&s;ort, who was &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly attached to the errors of popery, and importuned him ince&s;&s;antly in favour of the Roman ca|tholics. Such were the &s;ources of all that mi&s;government which was imputed to him during the fir&s;t fifteen years of his reign. From the beginning of the civil war to his fatal cata&s;trophe, his conduct &s;eems to have been unexcep|tionable. His infirmities and imperfections have been candidly owned in the cour&s;e of the narration. He was not very liberal to his dependents; his con|ver&s;ation was not ea&s;y, nor his addre&s;s plea&s;ing; yet the probity of his heart, and the innocence of his manners, won the affection of all who attended his per&s;on, not even excepting tho&s;e who had the charge of his confinement. In a word, he certainly de&s;erved the epithet of a virtuous prince, though he wanted &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;hining qualities which con&s;titute the character of a great monarch.</P>

<P>The per&s;ons devoted to death under this form of ju&s;tice, were the duke of Hamilton, the earl of Holland, the lord Goring whom the king had created earl of Norwich, lord Capel, and Sir John Owen, accu&s;ed of having carried arms again&s;t the parliament. The duke of Hamilton had made his e&s;cape, and was di&s;covered by accident in the Borough of Southwark, from whence he was conveyed to the Tower. At his trial, he pleaded, that he was not a &s;ubject of England; but a pri&s;oner of war, taken in open ho&s;tility, acting by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion from the parliament of his own country. The judge told him he was tried as earl of Cambridge; and that having accepted this title, and &s;at in the Engli&s;h parliament, he was become a &s;ubject of England. The $arl of Holland, being oppre&s;&s;ed with age and infirmities, made very little defence. The earl of Norwich &s;aid he had been bred from his youth in the court, and received many obligations from his maje&s;ty, whom he thought it was his duty to obey. Lord Capel refu&s;ed to acknowledge the juri&s;diction of the court; he claimed a fair trial by his peers, if he had done any thing con|trary to the laws. He affirmed, that when Colche&s;ter was taken, general Fair|fax had promi&s;ed that his life &s;hould be &s;pared: but this promi&s;e was over|ruled, upon the general's declaring he had only exempted the pri&s;oner from military execution. Sir John Owen &s;aid he had &s;erved the king according to his con&s;cience, and the oath of allegiance he had taken. They were all con|victed, and condemned to lo&s;e their heads. Sir John Owen hearing the &s;en|tence, thanked the court, with a profound reverence, for adjudging him to &s;uch an honourable death; and &s;wore, by God! he was afraid they would have ordered him to be hanged like a felon. Their friends petitioned the par|liament in their behalf; and the earl of Norwich, with Sir John Owen, were reprieved. The duke, when he mounted the &s;caffold, complained bitterly of the &s;entence, by which he &s;uffered death for obeying orders which he could not have rejected, without incurring the penalty of high trea&s;on.

<P>The prince of Wales, now in the eighteenth year of his age, re$ided at the Hague, where he received the melancholy tidings of his father's death. He forthwith a&s;&s;umed the ti$le of king: and all tho&s;e who attended him, and had be$n memb$r$ of his father's council, were now continued as coun&s;ellors, and took the o$th ac$$rdingly. He &s;ub&s;i&s;ted entirely on the friend&s;hip and bounty of his brother-in-l$w the prince of Orange; but he &s;oon &s;aw him&s;elf in d$nger of b$$ng cut off from that re&s;ource. The &s;tates of Holland, fore&s;eeing that the pa$$$$ment would in&s;i&s;t upon their obliging him to leav$ their domi+n$ons, were inclined to anticipate the demand; and the king bei$g in$ormed of their inclination$ re&s;olved to prevent the di&s;grace of a di&s;mi$&s;ion: but he knew not where $o find a retreat. In his father's lif$-time, he had met with an inho&s;pit$ble r$cep$ion in $rance; and he was too well acquainted with the d$&s;|po&s;ition of the queen r$gent and the car$inal, to beli$ve they would now pr$fer his fri$nd&s;hip to tha$ of the n$w r$publ$c: be&s;ides, he could not reli&s;h th$ pro&s;p$$t of living with a mother who had endeavoured already to direct his conduct with the mo&s;t de&s;potic authority. In this emergency Charles fixed his eye upon Ireland. The pope's nuncio had rendered him&s;$lf &s;o odious to the catho$$cs o$ that kingdom, that he was obliged to retire. The marquis of Ormond $$v$ng conc$uded a &s;econd treaty with the council of Kilkenny, took the com|mand of th$ir f$rc$s, with which he wre&s;ted Dundalk, Newry, Trim, a$d Drogh$$$, from the hands of the parliament of England, and re&s;olved to un|$$$$$ke the &s;iege of Dublin. Prince Rupert, who now commanded the king's $$eet, had been cha$ed by a &s;uperior navy under the earl of Warwick, and re|t$red to the harbour of King&s;ale, wh$re he lay in &s;afety, and was able to fa|vour the operations of the m$rquis. Thit$er Charles re&s;olved to retire, when his d$&s;ign was &s;u$$end$d, in con&s;equ$$$$ of the inte$ligence he received from Scotland.</P>

<P>The parliament in that kingdom had di&s;avowed the proceedings again&s;t the late king; and in high terms taxed the Engli&s;h parliament with a violation of the covenant, in&s;omuch that their commi&s;&s;ioners were arre&s;ted, and for &s;ome time detained in cu&s;tody. The Scots hated the independents, whom they con&s;idered as implacable enemies to their nation, as well as to the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline; and they dreaded the thoughts of a republican govern|ment, &s;ettled upon the principles which the Engli&s;h parliament &s;eemed to pur|&s;ue. Their &s;tates therefore being a&s;&s;embled, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, acknow|ledging Charles II. as their lawful and hereditary &s;overeign, on condition that, before his admi&s;&s;ion to the exerci&s;e of the regal functions, he &s;hould give pro|per &s;atisfaction to the kingdom, touching the &s;ecurity of religion, the union between the two nations, and the peace of Scotland, according to the national and &s;olemn league and covenant. Deputies were &s;ent to inform the king of this tran&s;action; and they reached the Hague ju&s;t at the time when the earls of Lanerk and Lauderdale arrived in Holland. In a few days after their landing, the king was vi&s;ited by the marquis of Montro&s;e, who had formerly payed his re&s;pects to the queen and Charles, then prince of Wales, at Paris, where they received him very coldly, becau&s;e they were afraid of di&s;obliging the cove|nanters, by whom the marquis was abhorred. After that interview, Montro&s;e engaged in the &s;ervice of the emperor; but hearing of his ma&s;ter's martyrdom, he now repaired to the Hague, with a numerous retinue of gentlemen, who followed his fortunes, and made a tender of his &s;ervice to his young &s;overeign: &s;o that now the king was be&s;ieged by three parties of the Scotti&s;h nation, who hated one another; namely, the rigid covenanters, patronized by Argyle; the moderate pre&s;byterians, who adhered to duke Hamilton; and the royali&s;ts, headed by Montro&s;e. The king had no great rea&s;on to be rejoiced at the news of his being proclaimed, under &s;uch re&s;trictions. He was di&s;plea&s;ed at their in&s;o|lence, in pre&s;uming to capitulate with their &s;overeign: he remembered that the ruin of his father was entirely owing to the Scotti&s;h pre&s;byterians: he had no great opinion of their power and unanimity: he dete&s;ted their hypocri&s;y, was aver&s;e to their au&s;tere manners, and waved their invitation. In&s;tead of &s;ub|&s;cribing to their conditions, he per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign to vi&s;it Ireland; and in the mean time granted a commi&s;&s;ion to Montro&s;e to make a de&s;cent upon Scotland.</P>

<P>Charles, in con&s;equence of his mother's importunities, re&s;olved to vi&s;it her before his voyage to Ireland. He was the more inclined to gratify her in this reque&s;t, as he perceived the &s;tates-general were heartily tired of his re&s;iding in Holland: be&s;ides, his departure was ha&s;tened by an incident which gave great umbrage to the Dutch nation. Dr. Dori&s;laus, a native of Delft, who had lived many years in England, and been employed as judge-advocate in the parliament's army, was now &s;ent over to the Hague, in quality of agent from the two hou&s;es. On the very evening of his arrival, as he &s;at at &s;upper in a public ordinary, five or &s;ix &s;trangers entering the apartment, with their &s;words drawn, one of them de&s;ired the company would be under no apprehen&s;ion, as their bu&s;ine&s;s was only with Dori&s;laus, agent to the rebels in England, who had &s;o lately murdered their &s;overeign. So &s;aying, he pulled him a&s;ide, and killed him on the &s;pot. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in and his confederates retired unmo|le&s;ted: but they were known to be Scotti&s;h officers depending upon the mar|quis

of Montro&s;e. The &s;tates did not fail to complain of this outrage; but they behaved with great re&s;pect to the king, and proceeded &s;o &s;lowly in their inqui&s;ition, that the offenders had time to con&s;ult their own &s;afety.</P>

<P>Charles, in order to avert the di&s;grace of a formal intimation to be|gone, de&s;ired an audience of the &s;tates of Holland, to whom he explained the nature of his &s;ituation, with regard to Scotland and Ireland, and craved their advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. After this in&s;tance of his confidence and e&s;teem, they could not with any decency de&s;ire him to withdraw, e&s;pecially as he had &s;igni|fied his re&s;olution to vi&s;it Ireland with the fir&s;t opportunity. Mean while, he appointed the lord Cottington, and Mr. Hyde chancellor of the exchequer, his amba&s;&s;adors and plenipotentiaries to the court of Madrid, to &s;ollicit &s;uccours from his mo&s;t catholic maje&s;ty. His friends in Scotland under&s;tanding he was aver&s;e to the conditions which the parliament wanted to impo&s;e, determined to excite an in&s;urrection; and, if it &s;hould be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, receive him upon his own terms. Colonel Middleton and Monro, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Gordons, levied &s;ome troops, and &s;urpri&s;ed Inverne&s;s; but they were &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed by the vigilance and activity of Strachan, an officer employed again&s;t them by the parliament.</P>

<P>The face of affairs in Ireland underwent &s;uch an alteration as ren|dered it impracticable for the king to go thither with any pro&s;pect of advan|tage. The Engli&s;h hou&s;e of commons was now at lei&s;ure to provide for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$$$endon.</NOTE> &s;ecurity of that kingdom. They were alarmed at the union of the royali&s;ts and the Iri&s;h Roman catholics: they voted a &s;trong army for that &s;ervice, and Crom|well was appointed lord lieutenant of the kingdom. The levellers, incen&s;ed at<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$$er.</NOTE> finding them&s;elves treated as mutineers, and &s;owers of &s;edition; after they had acted &s;uch a con&s;iderable part in reducing the pre&s;byterians, began to a&s;|&s;emble, on pretence of deliberating upon the choice of the troops to &s;erve in Ireland; and actually took po&s;t at Burford, to the number of five thou&s;and, pretending Cromwell had promi&s;ed that no part of the army &s;hould approach within t$n miles of their rendezvous: but Reynolds, by the direction of Fair|fax, fell upon them &s;uddenly, at the head of &s;ix thou&s;and men, and they were totally routed. About fourteen hundred he made pri&s;oners and &s;ent to Lon|don: a few of the&s;e were executed, and the re&s;t pardoned through the medi|ation of Cromwell.</P>

<P>While Oliver was employed in preparing his forces for the Iri&s;h ex|pedition, the marquis of Ormond undertook the &s;iege of Dublin: but hearing that Cromwell intended to land his troops in Mun&s;ter, he detached lord Inche|quin to that province to oppo&s;e him, and began to form the blockade of Dub|lin, though his army was now con&s;iderably weakened. Cromwell had &s;ent thither a reinforcement of three thou&s;and men; and colonel Jones the go|vernor being thus &s;trengthened, would no longer remain upon the defen&s;ive. He made a &s;ally with the be&s;t part of his garri&s;on, and charged the quarters of the be&s;iegers at day-break with &s;uch fury, that Ormond's army fled with great precipitation; he him&s;elf e&s;caping with difficulty, after he had made a gallant &s;tand with a body of officers. Cromwell being informed of this action, changed his de&s;ign; and, in&s;tead of landing in Mun&s;ter, &s;ailed directly to Dub$in, where he arrived in the middle of Augu&s;t. Then the marquis retired with the wreck of his army to a greater di&s;tance, after having thrown into

The&s;e unfavourable events deterred the king from pro|&s;ecuting his purpo&s;e of repairing to Ireland: but, as he found his &s;ituation at Paris very uncomfortable, both on account of his mother's temper, and the mortifying neglect of the French court, he retired with his brother the duke of York, and his little court, to the i&s;land of Jer&s;ey, where Sir George Car|teret the governor &s;till pre&s;erved his $idelity inviolate. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendo$$</NOTE></P>

<P>The committee of the Scotti&s;h parliament, which had received no de|finitive an&s;wer from Charles, di&s;patched George Windram to the king, with propo&s;als for his &s;ettlement in Scotland, according to a treaty to be concluded between him and the &s;tates; but they prote&s;ted they would not begin the ne|gotiation, until he &s;hould have acknowleged the legality of the pre&s;ent par|liament. Before Windram reached Jer&s;ey, the king had received the account<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitelock.</NOTE> of Ormond's defeat, and Cromwell's progre&s;s in Ireland, where he had taken Tredagh by a&s;&s;ault, and put the garri&s;on and Iri&s;h inhabitants to the &s;word, without di&s;tinction of age of &s;ex. Charles was moreover importuned by the queen and the prince of Orange, to li&s;ten to the Scotti&s;h propo&s;als; &s;o that Windram found him extremely well di&s;po&s;ed to a treaty. Not that he would have conde&s;cended &s;o far, could he have found any other re&s;ource; for, after he had a&s;&s;ured Windram that he would meet the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners at Breda, in the month of March, he wrote a letter to Montro&s;e, to ha&s;ten his preparations for a de&s;cent upon Scotland, in hope that his &s;ucce&s;s would &s;pare him the mortification of treating with tho&s;e whom he con&s;idered as the wor&s;t of rebels. When Windram returned to his own country, the parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bate.</NOTE> and general a&s;&s;embly of the kirk, influenced by the marquis of Argyle, con|curred in preparing a &s;et of propo&s;itions, and appointed deputies to open the conferences at Breda. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>They met the king at the appointed time and place, and pre&s;ented him with four articles of peace, from which they would not recede. They demanded that none of tho&s;e who had been excommunicated by the kirk, &s;hould have acce&s;s to his maje&s;ty: That he would declare upon oath, and by writing &s;igned with his privy-&s;eal, his approbation of the national covenant, and the &s;olemn league and covenant of the two kingdoms, and fulfil the intention of them to the be&s;t of his power: That he would confirm and ratify the acts of parliament enjoining the &s;ub&s;cription of tho&s;e covenants, e&s;tabli&s;hing the pre&s;byterian church-government, the Directory, the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, and the Cate|chi&s;m: That he would practi&s;e them him&s;elf; give order that they &s;hould be practi&s;ed by his dome&s;tics; and promi&s;e that he would never allow them to be changed: finally, That all civil concerns &s;hould be regulated by the parlia|ment, and all eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs by the general a&s;&s;embly. Charles did not receive the&s;e propo&s;als without indignation, which, however, he carefully di&s;|&s;embled, becau&s;e he was in no condition to manife&s;t his re&s;entment. He &s;igni|fied his aver&s;ion to take the covenant, which indeed he dete&s;ted: he offered to confirm the presbyterian di&s;cipline in Scotland, by act of parliament; but, with re&s;pect to his own per&s;on, he thought it unrea&s;onable to expect that he &s;hould re|nounce the religion in which he had been educated. He de&s;ired to know if they

had power to relax in any d$mand, or to treat about the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he might expect from the Scots, towards his being re&s;tored to the crown of England. They owned they had no &s;uch powers; and that he had no other alternative but that of accepting or rejecting their propo&s;itions.</P>

<P>Shocked as he was, at this in&s;olent impo&s;ition, he found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to temporize, and protracted the nego$iation, until he &s;hould hear from Montro&s;e, upon who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s all his hopes were founded. That heroic nobleman having been &s;upplied with money by the king of Denmark, and &s;ome private gentlemen of his own country, who were &s;ettled in that king|dom, and in Sweden, purcha&s;ed &s;ome arms and ammunition, which, with about five hundred &s;oldiers, he tran&s;ported to the mo&s;t northern parts of Scot|land, at the very time when the commi&s;&s;ioners were at Breda. He &s;urpri&s;ed a ca&s;tle, in which he &s;ecured his military &s;tores, &s;ummoned his friends to join him, and publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, repre&s;enting, that he was come by virtue of his maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ion, to protect his fellow-&s;ubjects, without any intention to interrupt the negotiation at Breda. On the contrary, he hoped to facilitate the conclu&s;ion of it, by means of his army; and &s;hould it be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, he would immediately lay down his arms.</P>

<P>The parliament at Edinburgh was exceedingly irritated again&s;t the king, for having, at &s;uch a conjuncture, granted a commi&s;&s;ion to a per&s;on who was alike the object of their terror and abhorrence, degraded and forfeited by their court of ju&s;ticiary, and excommunicated by their clergy. They per|ceived the king's drift was to make his own terms. They forthwith a&s;&s;embled an army, under the command of David Le&s;ley: and, in the mean time, de|tached Strachan northwards, with a body of hor&s;e, to keep the country in awe, and hinder the royali&s;ts from joining Montro&s;e. The marquis had no cavalry, and very few parti&s;ans repaired to his &s;tandard; &s;o that he neither could procure intelligence of the enemy, nor with&s;tand them when they &s;uddenly appeared. The highlanders fled at the fir&s;t charge; but the foreigners made a vigorous &s;tand for &s;ome time, and the marquis fought with his u&s;ual intrepi|dity: at length, however, they were broken and di&s;per&s;ed. Montro&s;e him&s;elf being obliged to provide for his &s;afety in flight, threw away his george and garter, and exchanging apparel with a pea&s;ant, repaired in this di&s;gui&s;e to the hou&s;e of a gentleman who had formerly &s;erved under his command. There he lay concealed for two days; but, whether he was betrayed by his landlord, or di&s;covered by accident, he fell into the hands of Le&s;ley, who treated him with great in&s;olence; and, after having expo&s;ed him to the view of the people, in this wretched attire, conveyed him to Edinburgh, where the parliament was then $itting. At the gate of the city, he was delivered to the magi&s;trates, who cau&s;ed him to be bound down upon a high chair, placed in a cart pro|vided for the purpo&s;e, and conducted through the public &s;treet, that the people might have a full view of the man, at mention of who&s;e name they had &s;o often trembled. The common executioner &s;tood by him in the cart, before which the officers taken in the engagement walked in fetters, to the pri&s;on, where he was treated as a common malefactor.

<P>In two days after his commitment, he was brought before the parlia|ment, and bitterly reviled by the earl of Loudon the chancellor, who upbraided him with having broken the covenants, rebelled again&s;t God, the king, and the kingdom, and committed many horrible murders, trea&s;ons, and impieties. He told them, that as the king had conde&s;cended to treat with them, he would behave towards them with more reverence than he &s;hould otherwi&s;e have ex|pre&s;&s;ed for &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly. He &s;aid he had taken and kept the fir&s;t covenant, while they pro&s;ecuted the purpo&s;es for which it was ordained; that he had never &s;ub&s;cribed the &s;econd, which was productive of the mo&s;t mon&s;trous re|bellion; that he had rai&s;ed forces by virtue of his maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ion, and acted like a faithful &s;ubject, without perpetrating tho&s;e cruelties that were laid to his charge, or &s;uffering any blood to be &s;hed but in battle; on the contrary, he had always put a &s;top to the carnage as &s;oon as he po&s;&s;ibly could take &s;uch a &s;tep with any regard to his own &s;afety, and had &s;aved the lives of many per&s;ons then pre&s;ent, to who&s;e evidence he appealed. He ob&s;erved, that he had laid down his arms, and quitted the kingdom, at his late ma&s;ter's command; that he had now again returned to Scotland, by the authority of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty. He ad|vi&s;ed them to con&s;ider the con&s;equence of proceeding again&s;t him in this man|ner, and demanded a fair trial by the laws of the land, or by the law of na|tions. He was condemned to be hanged next day on a gallows thirty feet high; and the &s;entence implied, that he &s;hould be afterwards quartered, and his members expo&s;ed in different parts of the kingdom. During this &s;hort inter|val, he was per&s;ecuted by their mini&s;ters, who told him, his &s;ufferings in this life would be but an ea&s;y prologue to tho&s;e which he would undergo hereafter; and, without &s;cruple, pronounced his eternal damnation. He heard them with &s;corn, ob&s;erving, that they were a mi&s;erable, deluding and deluded people, and would &s;hortly bring that poor nation to the mo&s;t in&s;upportable &s;ervitude. He declared, he was as well plea&s;ed to hear that his head &s;hould be placed on the Tolbooth, as he &s;hould be to know that his picture hung in the king's bed-chamber; and wi&s;hed he had fle&s;h enough to be di&s;tributed among all the cities of Chri&s;tendom, as a te&s;timony of the cau&s;e for which he &s;uffered. At the place of execution, the hangman tied about his neck, with a cord, an ele|gant Latin book, containing the hi&s;tory of his exploits, written by Dr. Wi&s;|hart, who had been his chaplain. He &s;miled at this mark of impotent malice, &s;aying, he was prouder of that collar than ever he had been of the garter. He demeaned him&s;elf with undaunted courage, and the mo&s;t pious re&s;ignation. He expatiated on the virtues of his murdered ma&s;ter; &s;poke in prai&s;e of the ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of the pre&s;ent king, and fervently prayed that they might not betray him as they had betrayed his father. After &s;ome devout ejacula|tions, he chearfully &s;ubmitted to the &s;entence, which was executed with every circum&s;tance of barbarous exultation. Such was the ignominious death of James<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon.

<P>After the death of Montro&s;e, the king finding him&s;elf ab&s;olutely without other re&s;ource, &s;ub&s;cribed the terms which the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners had pre&s;ented, and embarked at Scheveling, with the earl of Lanerk, now duke of Hamilton, and his kin&s;man the earl of Lauderdale, who were &s;o ob|noxious to the rigid pre&s;byterians, that when they arrived in Scotland, they found it nece&s;&s;ary to retire to their re&s;pective hou&s;es for their per&s;onal &s;afety. The king was obliged to &s;ign the covenant, before the Scots would allow him to &s;et his foot on &s;hore. Then the marquis of Argyle received him with de|mon&s;trations of the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect: but all his Engli&s;h dome&s;tics of any quality, were removed from his per&s;on, except the duke of Buckingham. Daniel O Neal was apprehended, as an Iri&s;hman who had been in arms for the late king, and bani&s;hed from Scotland by order of the council: and they di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed Mr. Robert Long, principal &s;ecretary of &s;tate, Sir Edward Walker clerk of the council, and many other &s;ervants, who&s;e places they &s;upplied with rigid covenanters. He was &s;urrounded, and ince&s;&s;antly importuned by their clergy, who came to in&s;truct him in religion; obliged to give con&s;tant attendance at their long &s;ermons and prayers, which generally turned upon the tyranny of his father, the idolatry of his mother, and his own malignant di&s;po&s;ition. They in&s;i&s;ted upon his ob&s;erving Sunday as the mo&s;t rigorous fa&s;t of a Jewi&s;h &s;abbath; they kept a &s;trict watch upon his looks and ge&s;tures; and, if ever he chanced to &s;mile during this religious mummery, he underwent a &s;evere re|primand for his pro$anity. With re&s;pect to the external appearances of royalty, he had no occa&s;ion to complain. He lived in great &s;tate and plenty, was well attended, and &s;erved with marks of deference and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but debarred all exerci&s;e of regal power, and re&s;tricted in every article of private &s;atisfaction. The marquis of Argyle at fir&s;t &s;trove to ingratiate him&s;elf with Charles, by the mo&s;t complai&s;ant deportment, and &s;uch entertaining conver&s;ation as he thought would be agreeable to his maje&s;ty: but, when the king hinted the de&s;ire of effecting an union between him and Hamilton, he appeared extremely aver&s;e to &s;uch a coalition, and gradually withdrew him&s;elf from all communication with his &s;overeign, whom he now &s;u&s;pected of a de&s;ign to accompli&s;h his de&s;truc|tion by means of his inveterate rival.</P>

<P>The Engli&s;h parliament, alarmed at the treaty of Breda, as &s;up|po&s;ing that the king would employ an army of Scots to recover the crown of England, re&s;olved to anticipate the danger, by carrying the war immediately into Scotland, whither, in all probability, they were invited by the marquis of Argyle; and for this purpo&s;e they recalled Cromwell from Ireland, which by this time was almo&s;t wholly &s;ubdued. The marquis of Ormond was di&s;abled from oppo&s;ing him effectually, by the di&s;&s;en&s;ions that prevailed among the Iri&s;h. Monk, after a long impri&s;onment, had been per&s;uaded to engage in the &s;ervice of the parliament, and now acted as one of their generals, under Cromwell. He concluded a peace with O Neal, which was authorized by the
<PB N="357" REF="3590">
council of &s;tate$ but the parliament having refu&s;ed to ratify it, as being too favourable to the catholics, O Neal began to treat with Ormond; and was on the point of joining that nobleman, when his purpo&s;e was prevented by death: then his troops di&s;per&s;ed of their own accord. Mean while Cromwell reduced Kilkenny, with many other places, and pro&s;ecuted his conque&s;ts with &s;urpri&s;ing rapidity. That the Iri&s;h might not have opportunities to compromi&s;e their dif|ferences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon. Bate.</NOTE> and unite again&s;t him, he, by proclamation, permitted their officers to enli&s;t as many &s;oldiers as they could engage in foreign &s;ervice, and a&s;&s;ured them that they &s;hould depart unmole&s;ted. Above five and twenty thou&s;and imme|diately took the advantage of this permi&s;&s;ion, and entered into the &s;ervice of France; &s;o that all oppo&s;ition was &s;ubdued. Then he con&s;tituted his &s;on-in-law Ireton deputy-lieutenant, and returned to England, in obedience to the mandate of the parliament. When he took his &s;eat in the hou&s;e, the &s;peaker thanked him for the &s;ervices he had done the commonwealth: then they pro|ceeded to deliberate upon the war with Scotland. They de&s;ired to know if Fairfax would conduct that enterprize. He knew they did not much depend upon his attachment, and that this was no other than a bare compliment. He therefore declined the &s;ervice, and &s;ent his commi&s;&s;ion to the commons, who gratified him with a pen&s;ion of five thou&s;and pounds, and appointed Oliver Cromwell general of the forces of the commonwealth. As the royali&s;ts and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitelock.</NOTE> pre&s;byterians exclaimed again&s;t the inju&s;tice of this war, the hou&s;e appointed a committee to draw up a declaration, in which they &s;uppo&s;ed that the Scots in|tended to intrude Charles II. into the throne of England, though they had not as yet &s;ignified any &s;uch intention.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XVII.</HEAD>
<P>They had indeed begun to levy &s;ome troops; and they were no &s;ooner informed of the Engli&s;h preparations, than they redoubled their dili|gence in a&s;&s;embling an army, the command of which they be&s;towed upon Le&s;ley earl of Leven. Argyle, in modelling this army, excluded all officers and &s;oldiers who were &s;u&s;pected of having a warm &s;ide to the royal cau&s;e. Commi&s;&s;ions were granted to none but rigid pre&s;byterians, who were generally de&s;titute of courage and di&s;cipline. They were directed by a committee of the kirk and &s;tate. The mini&s;ters encouraged them with long prayers, and preached with equal bitterne&s;s again&s;t the vices of the court, and the impiety of Cromwell. They promi&s;ed victory with as much confidence as they could have expre&s;&s;ed, if they had been actually in&s;pired. With great difficulty they con&s;ented to the king's &s;eeing the army; but perceiving the &s;oldiers were plea&s;ed with the &s;ight of their &s;overeign, they removed him to a greater di|&s;tance, declaring that the &s;oldiers were too much inclined to put their confi|dence in the arm of fle&s;h, whereas their hope and dependence ought to be in the prayers and piety of the kirk.</P>

<P>About the middle of July, Cromwell, at the head of an army amounting to eighteen thou&s;and men, began his march for the Scotti&s;h border, where he publi&s;hed his manife&s;to, and under&s;tood that the Scots were en|camped, to the number of eight and twenty thou&s;and men, well armed and equipped, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. They had ordered all the people to quit the country between Berwick and the capital, and remove their effects; &s;o that Cromwell advanced without oppo&s;ition through a de&s;olate country, attended by a fleet which &s;upplied him with provi&s;ion. He found
<PB N="358" REF="3600">
the enemy &s;o &s;trongly intrenched between Leith, Edinburgh, and Dalkeith, that he could not attack them with any pro&s;pect of advantage, and thought proper to retreat towards Mu$&s;leburgh. Le&s;ley detached a body of hor&s;e to fall upon his rear, commanded by Lambert, over whom they gained &s;ome advantage. Next day a hot &s;kirmi$h happened between two detachments; and the Scots were repul&s;ed to their camp with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. Cromwell made another motion towards them, in hope of drawing them from their intrenchments; but all his efforts were ineffectual. After the two armies had remained in &s;ight of each other for &s;everal weeks, Cromwell was &s;o &s;traitned for want of provi&s;ion and forage, that he found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of retiring. He re&s;olved to embark his infan$ry on board of the fleet, and return with his hor&s;e to Ber|wick. With this view he marched to Dunbar, where his navy lay at anchor; and by this time his army was dimini&s;hed to about twelve thou&s;and men. He was followed by the Scots, who encamped upon a hill, at the di&s;tance of a mile from Dunbar, in full confidence of putting an end to the war, by the de&s;truction of the whole Engli&s;h army.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XIX.</HEAD>
<P>Indeed Cromwell was now reduced to &s;uch difficulty, that he could neither embark his troops, pro&s;ecute his march, nor remain in his pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation, without expo&s;ing his army to the mo&s;t imminent danger of being defeated or &s;tarved. General Le&s;ley, &s;en&s;ible of his advantage, re&s;olved to keep his ground, and watch the motions of the enemy; but, the clamours of the mi|ni&s;ters who attended the camp, and boldly promi&s;ed victory in the name of the Lord, excited &s;uch a &s;pirit of impatience among the &s;oldiers, that he was ob|liged to yield to the torrent, and put his army in motion to attack the Engli&s;h. Cromwell had &s;pent his time in preaching, praying, and &s;eeking the Lord, from whom, he &s;aid, he received particular comforts and a&s;&s;urances, during the exer|ci&s;e of his devotion. On the &s;econd day of September, perceiving the Scots in motion, he exclaimed, "The Lord has delivered them into our hands;" and ordered his army to &s;ing p&s;alms, as if he had already been a&s;&s;ured of the victory. Indeed, he had no great rea&s;on to doubt of his &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t &s;uch an enemy. He then advanced towards them, and next morning before day-light, began the attack. The Scotti&s;h cavalry on the right wing made a vigorous charge; but were &s;oon repul&s;ed, broken, and put to $light: the left wing abandoned the field without engaging. Three regiments of their infantry &s;tood until they were cut in pieces; but all the re&s;t fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation. Above three thou&s;and were &s;laughtered on the &s;pot, and in the pur&s;uit; and among the&s;e &s;ome mini&s;ters, in the very act of encouraging them with a&s;&s;urance of vic|tory.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon. Bak$r. $word$.</NOTE> Seven or eight thou&s;and were taken, together with &s;even and twenty pieces of cannon, all their baggage and ammunition; while, on the other hand, the Eng|li&s;h did not lo&s;e above forty men in the engagement. Cromwell immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Leith and Edinburgh; but, the ca&s;tle held out till the latter end of December.</P>

<P>This defeat was far from being di&s;agreeable to the king, who re&s;ided at St. John&s;ton's. The Scotti&s;h parliament, which had excluded the Hamilto|nians, and all the royali&s;ts, from the army over which Cromwell had obtained the victory, now &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of employing them for the pre&s;ervation of the kingdom; and therefore treated the king as a per&s;on of &s;ome importance to the commonweal. They re&s;olved that all tho&s;e who had been formerly ex|cluded
<PB N="359" REF="3610">
&s;hould, upon proof of their repentance, be admitted to offices and em|ployments in the &s;tate and army. Great numbers did public penance, that they might have an opportunity to &s;erve their country; and the king &s;eon &s;aw his friends in a condition to exert them&s;elves for his intere&s;t. This change, however, was not effected without great oppo&s;ition from the rigid party, who prote&s;ted again&s;t the parliament's re&s;olution, and acquired the appellation of Prote&s;ters, while the other &s;ide were termed Re&s;olutioners. The former, &s;trengthened by an a&s;&s;ociation of the we&s;tern &s;hires, and joined by Strachan, Ker, and &s;ome other good officers, pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance to the parliament, by which it was declared &s;editious; but, as this faction was very numerous, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome mea&s;ure for their &s;atisfaction. To this end, the king was obliged to publi&s;h a declaration, acknowledging the &s;in of his fa|ther in marrying into an idolatrous family; and that he was guilty of all the blood that had been &s;hed in the civil war. He expre&s;&s;ed a deep &s;en&s;e of his own pernicious education, and the prejudices he had imbibed again&s;t the cau&s;e of God; he confe&s;&s;ed all the former part of his life, had been a cour&s;e of en|mity to the work of God; he pro&s;e&s;&s;ed his repentance for having granted a com|mi&s;&s;ion to Montro&s;e; and prote&s;ted he would adhere to this declaration to the end of his life. It was not without the utmo&s;t reluctance that Charles com|plied with this expedient, which did not produce the de&s;ired effect. The pro|te&s;ters believed, that this extraordinary &s;tep, by which he voluntarily &s;tigma|tized his own family, was no other than a cover to &s;ome de&s;ign which he had hatched again&s;t them. On this &s;uppo&s;ition, they engaged in a clo&s;er union among them&s;elves; and declared they would have no nearer communication with the re&s;olutioners, than with Cromwell and the Engli&s;h independents.</P>

<P>Charles, extremely chagrined to &s;ee he had expo&s;ed him&s;elf to no purpo&s;e, and very much di&s;&s;atisfied with his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, li&s;tened to a pro|po&s;al of the royali&s;ts, who &s;olicited him to join them at Dundee, where he would find a con&s;iderable body in arms. He e&s;caped in the night from St. John&s;ton's; but, at the place of rendezvous found only a very &s;mall party in waiting; and, while he deliberated upon his next excur&s;ion, he was overtaken by colonel Montgomery, whom Argyle had detached in pur&s;uit of him with a troop of hor&s;e. The king was obliged to return, not a little mortified at his di&s;appoint|ment; but, this attempt to e&s;cape had a good effect in his favour. The mar|quis of Argyle and the committee of the e&s;tates, were now alarmed with the apprehen&s;ion, that the rigour with which he was treated, might reduce him to take &s;ome de&s;perate re&s;olution, perhaps, that of joining the cavaliers, and involv|ing the nation in a civil war. They therefore relaxed in their &s;everity; and even admitted him to &s;ome &s;mall &s;hare in the admini&s;tration.</P>

<P>Charles perceiving that nothing effectual could be done for his &s;er|vice without the concurrence of Argyle, who was at the head of the clergy by whom the majority of the nation was directed, endeavoured to gain over that nobleman to his intere&s;t. He affected to treat him with uncommon affability and e&s;teem; and even hinted a de&s;ire of e&s;pou&s;ing his daughter. The marquis<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon. Burnet.</NOTE> kept aloof, becau&s;e he knew the king's aver&s;ion to his principles; but, his &s;on lord Lorn, who was captain of the guard, attached him&s;elf to the king, and faithfully executed his private commi&s;&s;ions. The ceremony of the coronation
<PB N="360" REF="3620">
was performed at Scone on the fir&s;t day of January; and, after that time, all per&s;ons were indi&s;criminately admitted into his maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence. Levies were now &s;et on foot, without di&s;tinction of parties; and an army of eighteen thou|&s;and men was completed by the beginning of June, before Cromwell could take the field, &s;o much was he retarded by want of forrage.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="23" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXIII.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 16$1.</NOTE> Charles appointed David Le&s;ley his lieutenant-general, and putting him&s;elf at the head of his troops, took po&s;t at Torwood, between Edinburgh and Stirling, in a very advantageous &s;ituation, having at his back a plentiful country, from which he could be conveniently &s;upplied with provi&s;ion. All the pa&s;&s;es of the Forth were &s;trongly guarded, and his camp &s;urrounded with in|trenchments, which &s;ecured him again&s;t any attack of the enemy. Cromwell marched up, and offered him battle; but, the Scots had been rendered circum|&s;pect by the experience of the preceding year, and would not quit their de|fences. After the two armies had faced each other about &s;ix weeks, Cromwell detached colonel Overton with &s;ixteen hundred men towards Edinburgh, and they pa&s;&s;ed the frith in boats provided for that purpo&s;e. He was immediately followed by Lambert with a more con&s;iderable body; and the&s;e two officers took po&s;t in the &s;hire of Fife, while Cromwell favoured their de&s;cent by ad|vancing to the king's intrenchments, as if he had intended to carry them by a&s;|&s;ault. The king no &s;ooner under&s;tood that the Engli&s;h had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fife, than he &s;ent major-general Brown, with four thou&s;and men, to give them battle; but, he being totally routed by Lambert, Cromwell tran&s;ported his whole army without further oppo&s;ition. Though he had thus cut off the king's com|munication with Fife, from whence he had drawn his chief &s;upplies of provi&s;ion, this motion had left the frontiers of England expo&s;ed; and even fru&s;trated the purpo&s;e of the war, which was undertaken to prevent the king from marching into England.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="24" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>Charles therefore, in&s;tead of following Cromwell, who now made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Perth, re&s;olved to &s;eize this opportunity of penetrating into England, where he did not doubt of being joined by a great number of roya|li&s;ts and pre&s;byterians. In that hope he took the route to Carli&s;le with all po&s;|&s;ible di&s;patch, and had been &s;everal days on his march before Cromwell received the lea&s;t intimation of his de&s;ign. This was the &s;econd capital error which Oliver had committed &s;ince he invaded Scotland; the fir&s;t was, that of &s;uffering him&s;elf to be cooped up at Dunbar, where nothing could have &s;aved him from ruin but the egregious folly of the Scots, joined to their want of true courage and di&s;cipline. When he received intelligence of the king's march into England, he wrote an account of it to the parliament, a&s;&s;uring them he would &s;oon be at the heels of Charles. He advi&s;ed them, in the mean time, to arm the militia in all the different counties, that the royali&s;ts might be prevented from a&s;&s;embling, and he him&s;elf be reinforced at his arrival in England. He detached Harri&s;on and Lambert, with a &s;trong body of hor&s;e, to harra&s;s the king in his march: he left Monk and five thou&s;and men in Scotland, with orders to reduce Stirling and Dundee; and then he began his march with great dili|gence, in hope of overtaking the king before he &s;hould reach London.</P>

<P>Charles had &s;ent colonel Ma&s;&s;ey before him, with a detachment, to receive tho&s;e who &s;hould join the royal &s;tandard; and he wrote to the earl of
<PB N="361" REF="3630">
Derby to quit the I&s;le of Man, and meet him in Lanca&s;hire, where that noble|man had great intere&s;t; but, events did not an&s;wer his expectation. The rigid pre&s;byterians in his army de&s;erted in great numbers, from a con&s;cientious di&s;|like to the &s;ervice. The militia of England overawed the royali&s;ts, &s;o that they could not ri&s;e in the king's behalf. The committee of the kirk, which followed the army, ordered Ma&s;&s;ey to publi&s;h a declaration, importing, that the king was a zealous friend to the covenant; and that &s;uch as refu&s;ed to &s;ign it would not be received in his army. Though the king forbade Ma&s;&s;ey to publi&s;h this de|claration, the purport of it was &s;o well known, that many cavaliers were deterred from joining their &s;overeign. The Engli&s;h pre&s;byterians were extremely aver&s;e to the king's being e&s;tabli&s;hed, until he &s;hould have previou&s;ly confirmed the conce&s;&s;ions made by his father in the treaty of Newport. The earl of Derby having a&s;&s;embled twelve hundred men for the king's &s;ervice in Lanca&s;hire, was encountered by colonel Lilburne, on his march with a reinforcement to Cromwell; and defeated, after an ob&s;tinate engagement, in which lord Withrington lo&s;t his life.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>The king's army, in&s;tead of being augmented, was daily dimini&s;hed by de&s;ertion and di&s;ea&s;e; &s;o that he laid a&s;ide his de&s;ign of marching to Lon|don, and directed his route to Worce&s;ter, where he thought he &s;hould be able to refre&s;h and recruit his fatigued army, without running great ri&s;que from the efforts of the enemy. He met with a cordial reception from the magi&s;trates of the place, where he was &s;olemnly proclaimed; and he quartered his troops in the neighbourhood. Mean while, Cromwell being &s;trongly reinforced, called in his detachments, and advanced towards Worce&s;ter, with an army greatly &s;u|perior in number to the royali&s;ts, who were encamped within a mile of the city, and waited the attack without flinching. Cromwell, re&s;olving to make a diver&s;ion on the other &s;ide of the Severne, detached Lambert to pa&s;s the river at the bridge of Upton, guarded by Ma&s;&s;ey, who defended it with great vigour, until he was &s;everely wounded and carried off; then the bridge was abandoned, and the enemy pa&s;&s;ed without further oppo&s;ition, under the command of Fleet|wood. Thus, the king was obliged to weaken his army, by &s;ending a detach|ment to the &s;ame &s;ide of the river.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>On the third day of September, the anniver&s;ary of the battle at Dunbar, Cromwell attacked the royali&s;ts at both ends of the town; and the engagement la&s;ted &s;everal hours, during which, the brigade commanded by the duke of Hamilton and general Middleton, fought with great gallantry, until Middleton was dangerou&s;ly hurt, the duke mortally wounded, and the greate&s;t part of his officers and &s;oldiers di&s;abled or &s;lain. No other part of the royali&s;ts made the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance. The cavalry were immediately driven back into the town, which was filled with confu&s;ion and di&s;may. In vain did the king en|deavour to rally and lead them back to the charge. They fled at full gallop; and being pur&s;ued by the enemy's hor&s;e, were killed, taken, or di&s;per&s;ed. The<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon. Whitelock.</NOTE> infantry, thus abandoned, were &s;eized with con&s;ternation, and &s;tood tamely to be butchered by the victors. Two thou&s;and peri&s;hed by the &s;word; and four times that number being taken, were &s;old as &s;laves to the American planters. The earls of Lauderdale, Rothes, Carnwath, Kelly, Derby, Cleveland, and ge|neral David Le&s;ley, fell into the enemy's hands; and the duke of Hamilton died of his wounds, &s;incerely regretted by all good men, as a nobleman of un|blemi&s;hed worth and integrity.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The king retired from the field with Le&s;ley, and a good body of hor&s;e; but, &s;eeing them overwhelmed with con&s;ternation, and believing they could not po&s;&s;ibly reach their own country, he withdrew him&s;elf from them in the night, with two or three &s;ervants, whom he likewi&s;e di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, after they had cut off his hair$ that he might hav$the better chance for remaining unknown. By the direction of the earl of Derby, he went to Bo&s;cobel in Shrop&s;hire, where he was for &s;ome days entertained by four brothers of the name of Pendrell; three of the&s;e acted as &s;couts, while the fourth accompanied the king, who being di&s;|gui&s;ed in the habit of a pea&s;ant, worked for &s;ome days at wood-cutting. Then Charles made an attempt to retire into Wales under the conduct of his compa|nion; but, the pa&s;&s;es of the Severne were guarded in &s;uch a manner$ that he re|turned to Bo&s;cobel, where he met with colonel Carele&s;s, who had, like him&s;elf, e&s;caped from the battle of Worce&s;ter. It was during his re&s;idence in this place, that they were obliged to climb a &s;preading oak, among the thick branches of which, they pa&s;&s;ed that day together, beholding, and overhearing the con|ver&s;ation of &s;everal per&s;ons, who went thither on purpo&s;e to &s;earch for their unhappy &s;overeign, that they might deliver him into the hands of his enemies. In the du&s;k of the evening, Carele&s;s conducted the king over hedges and ditches, for about eight miles, till they arrived at a cottage be|longing to a poor Roman catholic pea&s;ant, known to the colonel, who was him&s;elf of that religion. Their ho&s;t being sold that the &s;tranger was a cavalier who had e&s;caped from Worce&s;ter, conveyed him to a little barn al|mo&s;t filled with hay, among which the king enjoyed a profound &s;leep, after the farigue he had undergone in this la&s;t pilgrimage, which he had performed in his boots. But, before he went to re&s;t, it was thought proper that Carele&s;s &s;hould retire, as the danger was the greater while they travelled together; and &s;end &s;ome per&s;on in whom he could confide, to conduct the king to another place of &s;ecurity. Mean while he was entertained with coar&s;e bread and butter-milk, the be&s;t fare his landlord could provide, without incu$ring the &s;u&s;picion of his neighbours.</P>

<P>After he had re&s;ted two nights upon the hay-mow, a man came from Carele&s;s with directions to guide him to another hou&s;e, more out of the way of vi&s;itation, and, at the di&s;tance of twelve miles. Before he &s;et out on this nocturnal excur&s;ion, he exchanged apparel with his ho&s;t, who, in lieu of his boots, procured an old pair of &s;hoes; but they were &s;o unea&s;y to his feet, that$ after he had travelled in them a few miles, he threw them away and walked in his &s;tockings, and the&s;e were &s;oon torn with the hedges over which he pa&s;&s;ed. His feet were &s;o wounded with thorns and &s;harp &s;tones, and he was &s;o exhau&s;ted with the fatigue of this di&s;mal journey, that he &s;everal times threw him&s;elf on the ground in de&s;pair, chu&s;ing rather to be taken by his ad|ver&s;aries, than to proceed in &s;uch torture. His guide, however, u&s;ed &s;uch remon&s;trances as encouraged him to repeat his efforts, and before morning he reached the place of his de&s;tination, where he was again lodged in a barn among &s;traw, fed with the mo&s;t homely fare, and &s;upplied with &s;hoes and &s;tockings. From thence he was conveyed to a third hou&s;e; and thus, for &s;ome days, he pa&s;&s;ed from one to another, through the habitations of poor Roman catholics, who concealed him with great fidelity. He received great a&s;&s;i&s;tance from one Mr. Huddle&s;tone, a Benedictine monk, who provided him occa|&s;ionally with a hor&s;e, and more decent apparel than the wretched garb he had hitherto worn.</P>

<P>This man effected an interview between his maje&s;ty and lord Wilmot, who was likewi&s;e concealed in that neighbourhood. Wilmot intro|duced him to Mr. Lane, a worthy gentleman, in the county of Stafford, in who&s;e hou&s;e he was conveniently accommodated. There he read the pro|clamation, by which a price of a thou&s;and pounds was &s;et upon his head, and the penalty of high-trea&s;on denounced again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould harbour or conceal the per&s;on of Charles Stuart. He now deliberated with Mr. Lane about the means of e&s;caping to France; and the &s;on, who had been a colonel in his &s;ervice, was admitted to the council. They agreed that, as the king wi&s;hed to be in the we&s;tern parts of the kingdom bordering upon the &s;ea, he &s;hould ride before Mr. Lane's daughter to the neighbourhood of Bri&s;tol, on a vi&s;it to one Mrs. Norton, a friend and kin&s;woman of this young lady. The journey could not be performed in le&s;s than four or five days; and there was a nece&s;&s;ity for pa&s;&s;ing through many market-towns, where he might run the ri&s;que of being known: neverthele&s;s he re&s;olved to hazard the adventure. He was equipped with cloaths and boots for the &s;ervice; and, Mrs. Lane riding on the &s;ame hor&s;e behind him, was attended by a &s;ervant in livery; while the colonel accompanied them at a di&s;tance, with a hawk and &s;paniels, on pretence of taking his diver&s;ion. In this manner they &s;et out in the month of October; and, at the hou&s;e in which they lodged the fir&s;t night, they were met by lord Wilmot, with whom they adju&s;ted the &s;tages, in &s;uch a manner that he was &s;eldom &s;een in their company. On the morning of the fourth day colonel Lane returned towards his father's hou&s;e; and the king, with his conductre&s;s, arrived in &s;afety at Mr. Norton's habitation. During this journey, it was her con&s;tant practice, when &s;he reached their lodgings for the night, to repre&s;ent the king as a neighbour's &s;on, who, at the de&s;ire of his father, rode before her, that he might the &s;ooner recover of a quartan ague, with which he had been afflicted: on this pretence &s;he always provided a convenient bedchamber, to which he retired, and thither &s;he her&s;elf carried his &s;upper. He every day met people who&s;e per&s;ons he knew; and when he pa&s;&s;ed through Bri&s;tol, he could not help turning out of his way, from an emotion of curio&s;ity, and riding round the place where the ca&s;tle formerly &s;tood. When they arrived at the hou&s;e of Mr. Norton, the fir&s;t per&s;on he &s;aw was Dr. Gorges, one of his own chap|lains, &s;itting at the door, amu&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;eeing people play at bowls. Mrs. Lane, after the compliments of &s;alutation had pa&s;&s;ed between her and Mrs. Norton, de&s;ired that a chamber might be provided for William, who was newly recovered of an ague. This being immediately prepared, the king, who had retired to the &s;table, on pretence of &s;uperintending his hor&s;e, was conducted to his apartment. The butler, being &s;ent to him with a me&s;s of broth, no &s;ooner beheld his countenance, than he fell on his knees; and, while the tears ran down his cheeks, exclaimed, "I am rejoiced to &s;ee your maje&s;ty." He had been faulconer to Sir Thomas Jermyn, and was well acquainted with the phy&s;iognomy of Charles, who enjoined him &s;ecrecy even from Mr. Norton and his wife. He a&s;&s;ured him of his fidelity, and &s;crupulou&s;ly kept his word. After &s;upper he was vi&s;ited by Dr. Gorges, who now practi&s;ed medicine, and came to offer his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in quality of phy&s;ician. The king retired to the dark &s;ide of the room, where the doctor felt his pul&s;e, a&s;ked divers que&s;tions

concerning his health, bade him be of good chear, as the fever had left him, and withdrew.</P>

<P>Having &s;tayed &s;ome days in this place, he and lord Wilmot, who lodged in the neighbourhood, repaired to the hou&s;e of colonel Francis Wynd|ham, where he was cordially received, and introduced to that gentleman's mother, a venerable matron, who had lo&s;t three &s;ons and a grand&s;on in the &s;er|vice of his maje&s;ty's father. While he remained in this agreeable retreat, one Mr. Elli&s;on, a friend of the colonel, be&s;poke a bark at Lyme in Dor&s;et|&s;hire, to convey two pa&s;&s;engers into France. The &s;hip-ma&s;ter appointed a place in the neighbourhood of that town, where they &s;hould come aboard. The king, lord Wilmot, and the colonel, rode to a &s;mall inn near the beach, but no ve&s;&s;el appeared; and, after they had waited all night in vain, they re|turned to Elli&s;on's hou&s;e, which they had left the preceding day. This di&s;ap|pointment was owing to the fear of the &s;hip-ma&s;ter's wife, who &s;u&s;pected her hu&s;|band of having engaged in &s;ome dangerous de&s;ign, and declared &s;he would inform the magi&s;trate again&s;t him, &s;hould he attempt to leave his hou&s;e before morn|ing. The king made a very providential e&s;cape from the little inn at which he had lodged: it chanced to be a &s;olemn fa&s;t; and a fanatic weaver, who had &s;erved in the parliament's army, was preaching again&s;t Charles Stuart in a chapel that fronted the hou&s;e, where he actually &s;at among other &s;trangers. A farrier, employed to in&s;pect the &s;hoes of the hor&s;es belonging to &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;engers, took the liberty to examine that on which the king had travelled from the hou&s;e of colonel Lane, in hope of finding further employment. He told the inn-keeper, that one of tho&s;e hor&s;es had come from the north country; a circum&s;tance he pretended to know from the fa&s;hion of the &s;hoes. Then he repaired to the chapel; and, after the &s;ermon, communicated this particular to divers per&s;ons of his acquaintance; at length it reached the ears of the preacher, who declared the rider could be no other than Charles Stuart.</P>

<P>He went immediately with a con&s;table to the hou&s;e; and, finding the &s;trangers were gone, hired hor&s;es to go in pur&s;uit of them. Charles returned to the hou&s;e of colonel Wyndham, from whence he was conducted to a place of greater &s;ecurity, in the neighbourhood of Sali&s;bury, prepared for his reception. He pa&s;&s;ed through a regiment of hor&s;e, and met De&s;borough walking down a hill, with &s;everal officers. While he &s;tayed in the hou&s;e of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon.</NOTE> &s;erjeant Hyde, at Heale near Sali&s;bury, a ve&s;&s;el was provided by means of Dr. Hinchman, a prebend of that cathedral. Colonel Gunter, a gentleman of Su&s;&s;ex procured the bark at Brighthelm&s;ted, to which the king and lord Wil|mot were conducted by Philips: there he embarked, and was &s;afely landed in November at Fe&s;camp in Normandy, after having undergone an amazing variety of danger and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and experienced the un&s;haken fidelity of forty different per&s;ons of all ranks, to whom the pre&s;ervation of his life was intru&s;ted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account of the king's e&s;cape, chiefly ta|kes from Clarendon, who had it from the king him&s;elf, is different in &s;ome particulars from that which Mr. Pepy&s;s, &s;ecretary to the admiralty, af|terwards wrote from his maje&s;ty's own mouth.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>While Charles led this fugitive life, his adver&s;aries triumphed in the &s;ucce&s;s of their u&s;urpation. In Scotland Monk reduced Stirling, where he found the records of that kingdom, which he &s;ent to London, from whence they never returned. Then he be&s;ieged Dundee; which, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, he took by a&s;&s;ault, ma&s;&s;acred the garri&s;on and inhabitants, and abandoned the town to pillage. Aberdeen, St. Andrew's, and many other

places, &s;urrendered on capitulation; and, in a little time, he &s;ubdued all the Low Countries of Scotland. The republic of England had now acquired &s;uch reputation in foreign countries, that all the princes in Europe courted their friend&s;hip, and were afraid of giving any countenance or relief to the king, who lived in a wretched manner at Paris, by means of his mother's pen&s;ion, utterly neglected by the French king and the cardinal, who&s;e &s;cheme was to ingratiate them&s;elves with the parliament of England. Cromwell's intere&s;t and reputation had, by this time, ri&s;en to &s;uch a pitch, that he directed all the re&s;olutions of the hou&s;e, and was in effect chief of the republic, as well as general of the forces. He returned to London in triumph, and was met at Acton by the &s;peaker of the hou&s;e, accompanied by the mayor and magi&s;trates of London, in their formalities. General Ma&s;&s;ey was committed to the Tower, from whence he made his e&s;cape: the earl of Derby, being tried by a court|martial, was convicted of high trea&s;on, and beheaded at Bo&s;ton, where he died with great magnanimity: many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction were put to death by the &s;ame authority. The parliament &s;ent a body of forces to the I&s;le of Man, which they &s;ubdued; and the counte&s;s of Derby was reduced to extreme indigence, after &s;he had, with great gallantry, defended her lord's ca&s;tle. This was the &s;ame lady who &s;o bravely defended the hou&s;e of Latham. She was of the noble hou&s;e of Tremouille in France; a woman of a ma&s;culine &s;pirit, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitelock.</NOTE> had the honour of being the la&s;t Briti&s;h &s;ubject who &s;ubmitted to the victorious commonwealth. Jer&s;ey was taken by admiral Blake and colonel Hayne for the parliament. Sir George Ay&s;cue &s;ubdued Barbadoes, of which lord Wil|loughby was governor for the king; and the i&s;lands of Nevis and St. Chri&s;t|opher's &s;ubmitted at the fir&s;t &s;ummons.</P>

<P>The parliament now pa&s;&s;ed an act, abol&s;hing the royalty of Scotland, and incorporating that country with the Engli&s;h commonwealth: impowering it however to &s;end a certain number of repre&s;entatives to the Briti&s;h parliament. Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ent thither to regulate this union, in which the whole nation voluntarily acquie&s;ced, except a few royali&s;ts who had retired to the mountains under the earl of Glencairn and lord Balcarras, and the clergy, who prote&s;ted again&s;t the incorporation, becau&s;e it would produce a &s;ubordination of the church to the &s;tate, in the things of Chri&s;t. All cau&s;es were determined by a mixture of Engli&s;h and Scotti&s;h judges. Ju&s;tice was impartially admini&s;tered: peace and order were maintained by the prudent and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.</NOTE> upright conduct of general Monk, who commanded the forces in that king|dom. The people, &s;ecured in their property, exerci&s;ed them&s;elves in the arts of indu&s;try; and, under this u&s;urpation, they enjoyed infinitely more plenty and &s;atisfaction than ever was known to their ance&s;tors.</P>

<P>Prince Rupert, with his fleet, being obliged to quit Kin&s;ale, &s;teered to Portugal, and anchored in the river Tagus. Thither he was pur|&s;ued by Blake, who could hardly be prevented, by the remon&s;trances of his Portugue&s;e maje&s;ty, from attacking him in &s;ight of Li&s;bon. The prince at length e&s;caped, by the favour of that prince, and directed his cour&s;e to the We&s;t-Indies, where his brother prince Maurice was &s;hipwrecked in a hurricane. There he committed depredations on the &s;hips of Spain and tho&s;e of the republic; and, at la&s;t, returned to France, where he &s;old his prizes, together with the remains of his navy.

&s;hips richly laden, and intimidated that monarch with menaces of further ven|geance; &s;o that he was fain to make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the republic, and they con&s;ented to a removal of the alliance between England and Portugal. The conque&s;t of Ireland was fini&s;hed by Ireton the new deputy, who puni&s;hed with great rigour all the pri&s;oners who had been concerned in the ma&s;&s;acre; and, among the&s;e, Sir Phelim Oneale &s;uffered an ignominious death upon the gal|lows, which was a ju&s;t judgment upon him for the unparalleled cruelties he had committed. After Limeric was reduced, Ireton died of the plague in that city: Cromwell expre&s;&s;ed great &s;orrow, and the republicans were incon&s;olable at the death of this officer, who was a man of an inflexible, &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition, and an inveterate enemy to kingly government. His command devolved upon lieutenant-general Ludlow, who fini&s;hed the war with uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>The republic having now reduced the Briti&s;h dominions to obedience, re&s;olved to cha&s;ti&s;e the Dutch, again&s;t whom they had very &s;lender cau&s;es of complaint. The prince of Orange had died in the cour&s;e of the preceding year, leaving the prince&s;s far advanced in her pregnancy. Imme|diately after his death, the parliament &s;ent over Oliver St. John, and Walter Strickland, as amba&s;&s;adors, to propo&s;e a clo&s;e defen&s;ive alliance with the States-general. St. John's real aim was to effect a &s;trict union between the two commonwealths, and he dropped &s;ome hints on the &s;ubject; but he found the &s;tates aver&s;e to &s;uch a near connexion with an un&s;ettled government, which was odious to all the &s;tates in Chri&s;tendom. He was even affronted by the friends of the young prince of Orange born &s;ince his father's death, and expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of the populace, who were generally well affected to the family of Stuart. Incen&s;ed at this treatment, he endeavoured, at his return, to excite a war again&s;t Holland, and even prevailed upon Cromwell to concur with his endeavours. Perhaps that politician thought it might be nece&s;&s;ary to divert, by a foreign war, the attention of the people from con&s;idering the &s;cheme of em|pire which he had now projected; and employ tho&s;e hands, which might become trouble&s;ome from want of exerci&s;e. Some of tho&s;e who &s;u&s;pected his de&s;igns upon the commonwealth, imagined that a war with the Dutch might dimini&s;h his influence, as the operations would be chiefly by &s;ea, and the expence of the navy oblige the parliament to di&s;band the army, which was altogether at Crom|well's devotion.</P>

<P>The parliament, having re&s;olved to humble the Dutch, pa&s;&s;ed the act of navigation, prohibiting all nations to import any merchandi&s;e into England, but what was the produce of the country to which the &s;hips belonged. This &s;troke was directly levelled again&s;t the traffic of the Dutch, which con&s;i&s;ted wholly in tran|&s;porting foreign commodities from one country to another. The commonwealth granted letters of marque to divers merchants, who complained that their &s;hips had been unju&s;tly confi&s;cated in Holland; and they ripped up the old wound, occa&s;ioned by the cruelties which had been perpetrated upon the Engli&s;h &s;ub|jects, thirty years before, by the Hollanders at Amboyna. The States-general, alarmed at the&s;e mea&s;ures, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to London to &s;ollicit a repeal of the act of navigation: but the parliament, far from complying with their re|que&s;t, demanded &s;atisfaction for the ma&s;&s;acre at Amboyna, the murder of Dori&s;laus, the corre&s;pondence, which, during the civil war, the Dutch am|ba&s;&s;adors
<PB N="367" REF="3690">
had maintained with the late king; and they claimed about two mil|lions of money for the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained by the Dutch in the Ea&s;t-Indies, Perfia, Mu&s;covy, Greenland, and the I&s;le of Poleron. The Dutch perceived, by tho&s;e demands, that the Engli&s;h were re&s;olved upon war; and they began to put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>

<P>They &s;oon equipped one hundred and fifty &s;hips of war; and Martin Van Tromp, their admiral, was &s;ent into the channel with two and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

On the &s;eventeenth day of May he fell in with the Engli&s;h fleet, in the road of Dover, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix and twenty &s;hips, commanded by Blake, who ordered &s;everal cannon, with|out &s;hot to be fired, as a &s;ignal for the Dutch to pay the u&s;ual compliment of lowering their top&s;ails to the Engli&s;h flag. Tromp payed no regard to the&s;e warnings; and Blake no &s;ooner fired a ball at him, than he returned a whole broad&s;ide. The battle immediately began with great fury; Blake being rein|forced by captain Bourne with eight &s;hips during the engagement, maintained the fight from four in the afternoon till night, when Tromp retired to the back of the Goodwin-&s;ands, after having lo&s;t two &s;hips, one of which was &s;unk, and the other taken. The Engli&s;h hi&s;torians &s;ay, that none of Blake's &s;hips were much da|maged: whereas the Dutch pretend that &s;ix of them were actually &s;unk; and that, had not day-light failed, the Engli&s;h fleet would have been de&s;troyed. If that was the ca&s;e, Tromp ought to have kept his &s;tation, and next day renewed the engagement.</P>

<P>The populace of London were &s;o exa&s;perated by the news of this battle, that they in&s;ulted the Dutch amba&s;&s;adors; &s;o that the parliament ap|pointed a guard for their protection. The&s;e envoys, in an audience demanded for that purpo&s;e, affirmed, that Blake was the aggre&s;&s;or; and Adrian Paw arriv|ing at London as an extraordinary amba&s;&s;ador, confirmed their allegation, by laying before the hou&s;e Tromp's narrative of the action. He conjured them to inquire into the particulars of the affair; and if it &s;hould appear, that their admiral had actually refu&s;ed to compliment the Engli&s;h flag, and been the occa|&s;ion of the battle, the &s;tates-general would puni&s;h him for his pre&s;umption. He intreated them, by the common ties of their religion and liberties, to li&s;ten to terms of accommodation; and appoint commi&s;&s;ioners to renew the alliance between the two republics. They payed no regard to his remon&s;trances; and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon. Whitelock.</NOTE> notwith&s;tanding all his pretences, Tromp certainly &s;ailed with a view to quarrel with the Engli&s;h fleet, which he hoped to cru&s;h by dint of his &s;uperiority in number; for, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Blake would have cho&s;en to fight again&s;t &s;uch odds, without cau&s;e or provocation. The parliament having rejected the advances of the Dutch, and renewing their claims of &s;atisfaction, the &s;tates|general recalled their amba&s;&s;adors, and publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, declaring, they had been attacked without cau&s;e by the parliament of England. An an&s;wer was made to this declaration, denying the charge; and &s;pecifying the injuries the Engli&s;h had &s;u&s;tained from the republic of Holland: among the&s;e they mentioned Tromp's refu&s;ing to acknowledge the flag of England; and to this article the Dutch replied, that although they had been willing, in the infancy of their commonwealth, to pay that mark of deference to the monarch of England, they did not think them&s;elves obliged to ob&s;erve &s;uch ceremony to|wards a people who were no longer ruled by a kingly government.</P>

<P>They &s;ent Van Galen with a &s;quadron to the Mediterranean, again&s;t captain Badily, the Engli&s;h commodore in that &s;ea. Tromp &s;ailed towards the Downs, in order to engage rear-admiral Ay&s;cue, who lay at anchor in that road with part of the Engli&s;h fleet; but, hearing that Blake had &s;ailed northward with forty &s;hips, to de&s;troy the Dutch fi&s;hers and their convoy, on the coa&s;t of Shetland, he followed him with a very numerous armament. The two fleets came in &s;ight of each other near Newca&s;tle; but, when they were ju&s;t ready to engage, a violent &s;torm aro&s;e, and &s;cattered the Dutch navy in &s;uch a manner, that not above forty &s;hips returned with Tromp to Holland; though, in a few weeks, the re&s;t arrived at the Texel. Mean while Blake proceeded to the northward, de&s;troyed a great number of Dutch herring bu&s;&s;es; and took all their convoy. On the &s;ixteenth of Augu&s;t, admiral De Ruyter, with four and thirty &s;hips of war, and a large fleet of merchant &s;hips under his convoy, fell in with Sir George Ay&s;cue near Plymouth, who, though inferior in number to the enemy, engaged and fought them with great valour until night put an end to the engagement. The Engli&s;h admiral retired into Plymouth; and De Ruyter conducted his fleet in &s;afety to Holland. Van Galen had before this time attacked and defeated commodore Badily in the Mediterranean, though the victor lo&s;t his life in the action. Blake, on his return to the &s;outhward, met with another Dutch fleet on the coa&s;t of Kent, commanded by De Witte and De Ruyter. A battle en&s;ued, in which the rear-admiral of the enemy was boarded and taken, two of their &s;hips were &s;unk, one was blown up; and their fleet re|tired in the night, in a &s;hattered condition. The Engli&s;h now equipped &s;uch a formidable fleet, that the Dutch dur&s;t not appear in the channel: &s;o that a great number of their trading ve&s;&s;els fell into the hands of the enemy; among the&s;e a fleet of forty &s;ail from Portugal, and &s;ix &s;hips from the Ea&s;t-Indies, richly laden.</P>

Tromp &s;et &s;ail for this rendez|vous, with &s;eventy-&s;even &s;hips of war, including the &s;quadron of De Ruyter; and, on the twenty-ninth day of November, was encountered by Blake with an inferior fleet, near the Goodwin-&s;ands, where a de&s;perate battle was fought from eight in the morning till night. Blake was wounded, two of his &s;hips were taken, as many burned, one was &s;unk; and the darkne&s;s opportunely interpo&s;ed to &s;ave him from de&s;truction. He took that opportunity of retiring to the Downs; and Tromp, elated with his victory, continued his voyage with a broom fixed to his maintop-ma&s;t, as a &s;ignal that he would &s;weep the channel clear of the enemy.</P>

&s;kill, conduct, and intrepidity; the &s;ailors of each nation &s;ighting with &s;urpri&s;ing courage and per&s;everance. The engagement was renewed for three days &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively; and at la&s;t, Tromp, though overpowered with numbers, and &s;uperior weight of metal, made a very honourable retreat with his whole convoy, except|ing thirty ve&s;&s;els which fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h. He lo&s;t, however, eleven &s;hips of war; two thou&s;and of his men were &s;lain, and fourteen hundred taken; but the Engli&s;h fleet was &s;o &s;hattered in the battle, that they could not pretend to chace him up the channel; and the victory co&s;t them a good number<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitelock.

The &s;tates-general had incurred &s;uch an enormous ex|pence in the maintenance of this war, and their trade had &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely by the Engli&s;h crui&s;ers, that all Holland was filled with complaint and con&s;terna|tion; and they thought proper to make new conce&s;&s;ions to the haughty republic, which &s;eemed bent on their de&s;truction. The &s;tates of Holland wrote a letter to Lenthall the &s;peaker, propo&s;ing an accommodation; and this being favou|rably an&s;wered, the &s;tates-general, in a formal addre&s;s to the parliament, de&s;ired they would plea&s;e to appoint a place where they might treat of a pacification: but before this negotiation could be &s;et on foot, a &s;trange revolution happened in England.</P>

<P>Cromwell by this time perceived that the parliament dreaded his ambition; and that, under pretence of maintaining a &s;ea-war, they aimed at a di&s;&s;olution of the land-army. He knew that they had rendered them&s;elves odious to the nation by their arbitrary proceedings and extortion. There was no occa&s;ion for his employing much reflection with re&s;pect to his own conduct on this occa&s;ion. He con&s;ulted with his officers, who were &s;taunch to his in|tere&s;t; and they pre&s;ented a petition to the hou&s;e, demanding the payment of their arrears, and affirming, that the public revenue, if rightly and hone&s;tly managed, would be &s;ufficient for the regular &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the army, as well as for all the other nece&s;&s;ary expences of the government. The parliament or|dered the officers to be reprimanded for this in&s;olent addre&s;s; and forbid to in|termeddle in the admini&s;tration. Then the petitioners produced another re|mon&s;trance, importing, that the members had not performed their promi&s;e of di&s;&s;olving their a&s;&s;embly, that there might be a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of parliaments: they therefore de&s;ired they would put an end to their admini&s;tration, after having convoked another parliament; and named a council of &s;tate to admini&s;ter affairs in the mean time. This propo&s;al was &s;econded by all the members who enjoyed employments in the army, as well as by the pre&s;byterians who had been admitted into the hou&s;e, in con&s;equence of having &s;worn to the engagement; but the majority was of a different opinion. They re&s;olved, That it was not a proper time to di&s;&s;olve the parliament while the nation had a war, and a great variety of important affairs upon its hands; but, that the vacant &s;eats &s;hould be filled by new elections. At the &s;ame time, they appointed a committee to pre|pare a bill for an act, prohibiting all per&s;ons to pre&s;ent &s;uch petitions, on pain of being deemed guilty of high trea&s;on.</P>

<P>Oliver Cromwell was born at Huntingdon, of a good family, tho' he inherited but a &s;mall e&s;tate from his father. Far from making any profici|ency in his &s;tudies at the univer&s;ity, he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his di&s;&s;olute cour&s;e of life, con&s;uming his time and fortune in gaming, riot, and debauchery. At length, he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a &s;pirit of religious enthu&s;ia&s;m. He profe&s;&s;ed a reformation of manners; his deportment became &s;erious and &s;edate; he cho&s;e for him&s;elf a &s;ober helpmate; and &s;eemed to vie in holine&s;s with the wilde&s;t zealots of the puritanical party. His hou&s;e was converted into a conven|ticle; and his fortune was &s;oon wa&s;ted by his ho&s;pitality to the brethren. Then he commenced farmer at St. Ives; but neglected his temporal affairs, by in|dulging his religious reveries and illuminations. In&s;pired by the&s;e vi&s;ions, and prompted by the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs, he re&s;olved to tran&s;port him&s;elf into New-England with his friend John Hambden, that they might, in that land of revelation, enjoy unmole&s;ted their &s;piritual tran&s;ports; but, after they had actualled embarked, they were obliged to land again by an order of council$ His ob&s;tinacy and re&s;olution fir&s;t appeared in oppo&s;ing the earl of Bedford, who, by a patent from the crown, drained part of the fen-country near the I&s;le of Ely. When his circum&s;tances were extremely low, he found means to be elected member of the long-parliament for the town of Cambridge; and though the &s;pirit frequently moved him to &s;peak in the hou&s;e, his elocution was &s;o har&s;h, vulgar, confu&s;ed, tedious, and ob&s;cure, that he was not, for two years, heard with any attention, but overlooked among the herd of ignorant zealots; tho' John Hambden had founded the depth of his genius; and foretold his future greatne&s;s. On the day after the famous remon&s;trance had been carried by a very &s;mall majority, he told lord Falkland, that if they had not gained their point, he and many other hone&s;t gentlemen would have &s;old their effects, and
<PB N="371" REF="3730">
quitted the kingdom. He was certainly at that time a zealous republican; and acted again&s;t the king from principle. In the forty-third year of his age, he rai&s;ed a troop of hor&s;e, and &s;oon &s;ignalized him&s;elf by his prowe&s;s and military conduct. This troop he augmented to a regiment; and, by means of di&s;cipline, example, prayer, and exhortation, infu&s;ed his own &s;pirit into every individual under his command. In&s;tead of broken tap&s;ters, decayed &s;erving-men, and the very lowe&s;t cla&s;s of the people, that compo&s;ed the forces fir&s;t rai&s;ed by the parliament, he enli&s;ted freeholders, and farmers &s;ons, who fought from prin|ciple. Among the&s;e, he intermingled &s;ome of the mo&s;t zealous fanatics in England, who in a little time propagated the contagion through the whole re|giment, while Oliver him&s;elf preached, prayed, and puni&s;hed alternately, &s;o as to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;y&s;tem of di&s;cipline and enthu&s;ia&s;m. He was now ex|alted to that &s;phere in which his talents &s;hone to the greate&s;t advantage. In courage and conduct he equalled the mo&s;t renowned of his cotemporaries; but he excelled them all in fraud and di&s;&s;imulation. By the&s;e qualities he gained the a&s;cendency over Fairfax, while he was no more than the &s;econd officer in the army. His views were expanded by &s;ucce&s;s: his fir&s;t principles of republican equality &s;hrunk before the flame of his ambition; and, having ta&s;ted the &s;weets of unlimited command, he now a&s;pired at the &s;overeign au|thority.</P>

<P>The people expre&s;&s;ed little or no re&s;entment at the di&s;&s;olution of the parliament. On the contrary, he received congratulatory addre&s;&s;es from the fleet, the army, the chief corporations and counties, and from divers con|gregations of the &s;aints in different parts of the kingdom. The royali&s;ts and pre&s;byterians were plea&s;ed at the &s;ubjection of a party which had ruined the king's friends, and expelled the others from parliament. The independent faction at this time included two &s;ects, which, though concurring in republican prin|ciples, differed widely in every other &s;entiment. The&s;e were the millenarians or fifth monarchy-men, and the dei&s;ts. The fir&s;t, which was the mo&s;t nume|rous party, affirmed that dominion was founded on grace: that all di&s;tinction of magi&s;tracy ought to be aboli&s;hed, except the authority acquired by &s;uperior piety and holine&s;s: they expected Chri&s;t's &s;econd coming; and that, in the mean time, the &s;aints &s;hould govern upon earth. The dei&s;ts were the a&s;&s;ertors of unbounded liberty, both in religion and government: at lea&s;t they claimed more freedom than they could expect to enjoy under any regular admini&s;tration. Martin, Harrington, and Sidney, were the leaders of this cla&s;s, which Crom|well hated, becau&s;e, being free of fanatici&s;m, they were not within the &s;phere of his operation. The&s;e he reproached as heathens; but attached him&s;elf to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hume.</NOTE> the millenarians, upon who&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;m he could work with the utmo&s;t facility.</P>

<P>Though he had already a&s;&s;umed the &s;upreme authority, he thought proper to amu&s;e them with the appearance of a commonwealth. He fir&s;t of all ju&s;tified his conduct in di&s;&s;olving the parliament, by a declaration &s;igned by all the principal officers of the fleet and army. Then he re&s;olved, with their concurrence, that the &s;overeign power &s;hould be ve&s;ted in one hun|dred and forty-four per&s;ons, under the denomination of a parliament. Nothing could be more dextrous than Cromwell's choice of the&s;e members, who were wretches of the lowe&s;t birth, and meane&s;t intellects, &s;o entirely devoid of knowledge and experience in affairs, that he fore&s;aw they would &s;oon be

obliged to re&s;ign the ruins they were &s;o ill qualified to manage. He &s;ent a written order to each in particular, requiring him to repair to Whitehall on the fourth day of July, when, after having harrangued them in a tedious confu&s;ed di&s;cour&s;e, he delivered to them an in&s;trument on parchment, &s;igned by him&s;elf, and the principal officers of the army, importing, That the whole, or any forty of them, &s;hould be ve&s;ted with &s;overeign power to govern the nation: That all the &s;ubjects of England, Scotland, and Ireland, &s;hould be bound to obey them till the third day of November, in the following year: That, before the expiration of this term, they &s;hould elect a like number of repre&s;entatives to &s;ucceed them in the &s;overeign authority for one year; and that, for the future, there &s;hould be an annual rotation of parliaments. Thus authori&s;ed, they voted them&s;elves a parliament, cho&s;e Mr. Rou&s;e for their &s;peaker; and, being chiefly compo&s;ed of fifth-monarchy men, anabapti&s;ts, antinomians, and independents, they cho&s;e eight gifted members to &s;eek the Lord in prayer. They began the exerci&s;e of their function, by deliberating upon the abolition of the clergy, the tythes, the univer&s;ities, the court of chancery, and the common law, in lieu of which they intended to e&s;tabli&s;h the Mo&s;aical in&s;titution. The fanatics of this age &s;eemed particularly attached to the Old Te&s;tament, from which they borrowed the names they commonly be&s;towed upon their children: the appellations of James, John, Peter, and Andrew, were now rejected for tho&s;e of Hezekiah, Habbakuk, Jo&s;hua, and Zerobabel. Whole &s;entences were &s;ometimes u&s;ed as chri&s;tian names, <Q>&s;uch as &startq;Stand fa&s;t on high, Stringer; Fight the good fight of faith, White; God reward, Smart;&endq;</Q> the ten commandments were included in the prenomen of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitelock.

<P>The provinces of Holland and Zealand finding them&s;elves grievou&s;ly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the war, and the progre&s;s they had made towards a negotiation being fru&s;trated by the di&s;&s;olution of the parliament, the &s;tates|general now appointed four amba&s;&s;adors to treat with the new legi&s;lature of England. While they were employed in drawing up in&s;tructions for the&s;e envoys, admiral Tromp, with an hundred &s;hips, fell in with the Engli&s;h fleet commanded by Monk, Dean, Pen, and Law&s;on. They engaged on the third day of June, near the coa&s;t of Flanders, and fought with equal courage, un|til night parted them. Dean was killed in the action; neverthele&s;s, the Eng|li&s;h renewed the battle next day; and the Dutch were obliged to retire with great lo&s;s: for, towards the latter end of the engagement, the Engli&s;h were reinforced by Blake, with eighteen &s;ail of fre&s;h &s;hips. The victors pur&s;ued him to the coa&s;t of Holland, and totally interrupted the Dutch commerce, until the gallant Tromp had refitted his &s;hips, and thought him&s;elf in a con|dition to face the enemies of his country.</P>

<P>Cromwell ordered the fleet to be repaired with incredible di&s;patch, that he might take advantage of the con&s;ternation produced among the Dutch by the death of Tromp, and the ruin of their navy. But his armament was di&s;|per&s;ed and &s;hattered by a violent &s;torm; and, rather than load the people with new impo&s;itions, which might have excited a dangerous clamour at &s;uch a juncture, he determined to conclude a peace with the &s;tates-general. The ne|gotiation was accordingly begun, and continued during the whole winter. The Dutch amba&s;&s;adors at fir&s;t met with a very di&s;agreeable reception from the new parliament, which con&s;idered the Hollanders as worldly-minded men, whom the &s;aints were under the nece&s;&s;ity of eradicating from the face of the earth, before they could begin the work of &s;ubduing antichri&s;t. This a&s;&s;embly of fanatics had now &s;at five months, without doing any thing of importance; and, during that time, they became the object of ridicule and contempt to the whole nation. The people exclaimed again&s;t &s;uch a fooli&s;h legi&s;lature; and Cromwell was the better plea&s;ed at the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;content, as the parlia|ment, forgetting that they had derived all their authority from him alone, began to pretend a power from the Lord, and to in&s;i&s;t upon their divine commi&s;&s;ion.

Among the fir&s;t acts of Cromwell's &s;overeignty, was the ex|ecution of Mr. Vowel and colonel Gerard, two cavaliers who had hatched a con&s;piracy again&s;t his life: they were tried and found guilty by an high-com|mi&s;&s;ion court, which now took the place of juries. Vowel was hanged and Gerard beheaded on Tower-hill. The &s;ame &s;caffold &s;erved for the execution of Don Pantaleon Sa, knight of Malta, and brother to the Portugue&s;e am|ba&s;&s;ador. He had come upon the New-Exchange with armed attendants, in que&s;t of this very Gerard, by whom he had been affronted on the preceding day. He mi&s;took another man for the colonel, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated him on the &s;po$. Several per&s;ons were wounded in the &s;cuffle, by his attendants. He re|tired to his brother's hou&s;e, which was immediately &s;urrounded by the popu|lace, who demanded the murderer, and threatened to drag him out by vio|lence. Cromwell being informed of the tran&s;action, &s;ent a party of &s;oldiers for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and the amba&s;&s;ador was obliged to deliver up his brother, with all his a&s;&s;ociates.

Don Pantaleon &s;uffered decapitation, and all his accomplices were hanged at Tyburn. John IV. king of Portugal complained of this outrage upon the law of nations; but he received no &s;atisfaction, and yet forbore to recal his amba&s;&s;ador.</P>

<P>Charles II. had offered to &s;erve on board the Dutch fleet during the war; but the &s;tates declined the propo&s;al. He &s;till remained at Paris, &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting on a mi&s;erable pen&s;ion from the court of France, which was very ill payed; and now he had the mortification to &s;ee mon&s;ieur Bordeaux appointed amba&s;&s;ador to the protector of England. From this circum&s;tance he con+cluded, that he &s;hould be obliged to quit France; and, in order to &s;ave him|&s;elf the di&s;grace of a formal di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, he gave notice to Mazarine that he intended to retire from the French dominions. The cardinal was glad to find him&s;elf thus anticipated: he promi&s;ed to pay up the arrears, and continue his pen&s;ion; and the king received at that time another &s;mall &s;upply which enabled him to remove him&s;elf with decency.

<P>Cromwell, according to the act of government, i&s;&s;ued out writs for a new parliament, excluding however all tho&s;e who had carried arms for the king. They met on the third day of September, and the protector harangued them in the Painted-chamber. He informed them of the &s;teps he had taken for mo|delling the new government; a&s;&s;ured them of his upright intentions; recapi|tulated what he had done for the nation; told them he had convoked a free par|liament; and that he did not pretend to be their ma&s;ter, but their fellow|labourer. Notwith&s;tanding all the pains he had taken to procure a favourable parliament, he &s;oon found him&s;elf di&s;appointed in his endeavours. They cho&s;e Lenthall their &s;peaker, at his recommendation; but, their fir&s;t deliberations were employed in examining the nature of that authority by which they had been convoked. Cromwell had too many friends in the hou&s;e, to believe this inquiry would be brought to any determination; neverthele&s;s, he would not tamely &s;uffer his power to become the &s;ubject of di&s;pute. He therefore &s;um|moned them to the Painted-chamber, where he talked to them in a &s;tile quite different from that which he had u&s;ed in his fir&s;t harangue. He &s;aid, they a&s;|&s;umed too much liberty in que&s;tioning the e&s;tabli&s;hed government, from whence they derived all their authority; for, if they were not lawfully a&s;&s;embled, they had no power to deliberate. At their return to the hou&s;e, they found a guard at the door, which would not &s;uffer any member to enter, until he had &s;igned a recognition, by which he promi&s;ed to be faithful to the commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland; and, that he would never con&s;ent to a change in the government, e&s;tabli&s;hed under a protector and parliament. A good number who refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe this engagement, were excluded from the hou&s;e; and, many &s;igned it with no other view than that of having opportuni|ties to thwart his mea&s;ures. Several members engaged in a con&s;piracy, formed chiefly by the cavaliers, to take arms in different parts of the kingdom. Crom|well having received intelligence of this &s;cheme from his &s;pies, anticipated the purpo&s;e of his enemies, by di&s;&s;olving the parliament eleven days before the expi|ration of the term fixed by the act of government; and he gave them to under|&s;tand, at parting, that he knew &s;everal members were engaged in a plot again&s;t the admini&s;tration.</P>

<P>In two days after their di&s;&s;olution, he ordered major Wildman to be<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baker.

Some other per&s;ons, republicans as well as royali&s;ts, were apprehended on the &s;ame account. The king had received frequent intimations from his friends in Eng|land, that the government of the protector was odious to the whole nation; and he concluded, that all the enemies of Cromwell were well-wi&s;hers to him and his family; though this was a very fal&s;e conclu&s;ion. The royali&s;ts, on the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Wil|mot now created earl of Roche&s;ter$ and Sir Jo&s;eph Wag&s;taff came over privately to London. In a con&s;ultation with the royali&s;ts, it was agreed, that the earl &s;hould conduct the undertaking in the North; and that Wag&s;taff &s;hould command the in&s;urrection in the We&s;t. He accordingly &s;et out for Sarum; and having joined Mr. Penruddock, Jones, and Grove, who had a&s;&s;embled about two hundred hor&s;e, entered Sali&s;bury in time of the a&s;&s;ize. They took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the gates and the market-place, &s;eized the judges and &s;heriff; and proclaimed king Charles: but finding them&s;elves di&s;appointed in their expecta|tion of being joined by the inhabitants, they quitted the town, and retreated to the we&s;tward. Being pur&s;ued by a troop of hor&s;e that happened to be quartered in that neighbourhood$ they were &s;eized with &s;uch a panic, that they threw down their arms and &s;urrendered. Wag&s;taff e&s;caped; but, Penruddock, Jones, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Whitelock.</NOTE> Grove, were taken and executed. The earl of Roche&s;ter finding nothing pre|pared for a ri&s;ing in York&s;hire, thought proper to po&s;tpone the attempt; and $ound means to retire to the continent. Charles about this time di&s;covered, that all his mea&s;ures had been for &s;ome time betrayed by one of his own dome&s;tics, called Manning, who maintained a corre&s;pondence with Thurloe the protector's &s;ecretary; and this traitor was &s;hot in the ca&s;tle belonging to the duke of New|burgh. All oppo&s;ition was now at an end, in Scotland as well as in England. The earl of Glencairn, who commanded the Highlanders that &s;tood out for the king, had made his peace with the government; and Middleton, who &s;ucceeded him in that command, was in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year totally defeated by a detachment of Monk's army under Morgan.</P>

<P>Oliver, at length, found lei&s;ure to convert his attention to the affairs of the continent. The famous war of Germany, which had raged for thirty years, in con&s;equence of the palatine's having ra&s;hly accepted the crown of Bo|hemia, was now terminated by the peace of We&s;tphalia. The young palatine was re&s;tored to part of his dominions; and the rights and privileges of the members that compo&s;e the Germanic body, were fixed and a&s;certained. Gu&s;|tavus Adolphus king of Sweden, to who&s;e valour the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in the empire had been &s;o much indebted, was &s;ucceeded on the throne by his daugh|ter Chri&s;tina; and that prince&s;s, tired of the fatigues of royalty, had re&s;igned the crown to her kin&s;man Charles Gu&s;tavus, who trod in the &s;teps of the great Adolphus; and extended his conque&s;ts to the &s;outh &s;ide of the Baltic. In France, cardinal Richelieu had fomented the troubles again&s;t Charles I. of England, that he might not interfere with the cardinal's de&s;ign of humbling the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or Mazarine pur&s;ued the &s;ame plan of politics too far; for, in&s;tead of &s;upporting the ballance between the king and parliament, he &s;uffered Charles to be depre&s;&s;ed, and a much more formidable power to ri&s;e from his ruins. He &s;acrificed the intere&s;ts of Charles II. to his fear of di&s;obliging the commonwealth, by which he was &s;o little regarded, that their fleet attacked the French navy on their way to the relief of Dunkirk, which was be&s;ieged by the Spaniards. The cardinal dige&s;ted the in&s;ult; and &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador to Lon|don, to &s;olicit the friend&s;hip of the republic. With re&s;pect to Charles I. the court of Spain had manife&s;ted the &s;ame inglorious indifference, or rather coun|tenanced the amba&s;&s;ador Cardenas in a &s;candalous partiality for the parliament.
<PB N="379" REF="3810">
Since the martyrdom of that unhappy prince, they had indeed received lord Cottington and chancellor Hyde, as amba&s;&s;adors from young Charles; but, they received them coldly, and di&s;appointed them in the purport of their em|ba&s;&s;y, which was to obtain &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance for their nece&s;&s;itous prince. A&s;cham, &s;ent thither by the parliament, as their envoy, was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by &s;ome Iri&s;h of|ficers at Madrid; and the court of Spain, either could not or would not deliver up the perpetrators of this outrage, though one of them actually &s;uffered by the hands of ju&s;tice. Perhaps this incident might irritate the re&s;entment of the protector. He ought, according to the dictates of &s;ound policy, to have &s;up|ported the declining fortunes of Spain again&s;t the victorious hou&s;e of Bourbon; but, he had concluded a treaty with Charles X. of Sweden, who was nearly connected with France; and he was unwilling to take any &s;tep which might di&s;oblige his new ally, who&s;e friend&s;hip he had eagerly courted. Be&s;ides, Crom|well was influenced by religious motives. He thought his alliance with France would enable him to procure &s;ome indulgence for the prote&s;tants of that kingdom. He looked upon the Spaniards as a people bigotted to the &s;uper&s;titions of po|pery, and &s;laves to the inqui&s;ition, which he abhorred. Tho&s;e religious prejudices form a &s;trong contra&s;t in the character of this great u&s;urper. He thought it nece&s;&s;ary to gild the morning of his protector&s;hip with &s;ome &s;ignal exploit. He thir&s;ted after the wealth of the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies; he was importuned and flattered by the &s;ubtle Mazarine: and, on the&s;e con&s;iderations, he determined to wage war with the Spani&s;h branch of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>

<P>Immediately after his elevation to the protector&s;hip, he &s;ent Blake with a fleet into the Mediterranean, to cha&s;ti&s;e the cor&s;airs of Algier, who had committed depredations on the Engli&s;h traders.

By the&s;e he was directed to make a de&s;cent upon the i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola; and attack the capital St. Domingo. In April they de&s;cried the i&s;land; and at &s;ight of their fleet the Spaniards abandoned their town; but, when they &s;aw Venables landing his &s;oldiers at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the place, they recovered their &s;pirits, returned to their habitations, and prepared for a vigorous defence. The Engli&s;h were &s;o fatigued by a long march in a hot climate, without water to quench their thir&s;t, that when they arrived at St. Domingo, they could hardly &s;tand under their arms. They were immediately repul&s;ed, and obliged to reimbark with precipitation, leaving on the i&s;land a con&s;iderable number of their men killed and wounded. After this mi&s;carriage, the fleet &s;teered to Jamaica, which they conquered, almo&s;t without oppo&s;ition. Having left &s;ome troops in this i&s;land, they returned to England; and the protector was &s;o exa&s;perated at their having failed in the attempt upon Hi&s;paniola, that he ordered Penn and Venables to be &s;ent pri&s;oners to the Tower. Neverthele&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baker. Clarendon. Thurloe.</NOTE> he took care to reinforce the garri&s;on at Jamaica; and that i&s;land &s;oon became a flouri&s;hing colony.</P>

England. On the twenty-third day of October, Oliver publi&s;hed the peace with France, which was no other than a renewal of antient treaties. Knowing how much he was hated by the royali&s;ts, pre&s;byterians, independents, and even by &s;ome officers of di&s;tinction in the army; he thought he could not be too much on his guard again&s;t in&s;urrection, and took his precautions accordingly. On pretence of keeping the cavaliers in awe, he divided England into eleven provinces; and each of the&s;e he a&s;&s;igned to a major-general, who governed without controul. The&s;e officers, ve&s;ted with unlimited powers, became real tyrants; and oppre&s;&s;ed the people in &s;uch a manner, that the protector was obliged to abridge their authority.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

This officer in a few days de&s;cried the galleons, to which he gave chace. The Spani&s;h admiral and two of his captains ran their ve&s;&s;els a&s;hore; but two &s;hips richly laden fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h, and two were &s;et on fire. In one of the&s;e the marquis of Bajadox peri&s;hed with his wife and daughter. When the prizes arrived at Port&s;mouth, the protector gave order, that the trea&s;ure &s;hould be conveyed to London in waggons, which proceeded through the &s;treets in triumph. Blake having re|ceived intelligence that the fleet from Peru had taken &s;helter among the Cana|ries, &s;ailed thither; and found them in the bay of Santa Cruz, in a very formi|dable po&s;ture of defence. The bay was fortified by a ca&s;tle and &s;even forts, united by a line of communication. Don Diego Diagues the Spani&s;h admiral had moored his &s;maller ve&s;&s;els clo&s;e to the &s;hore, and the larger galleons farther out, with their broad&s;ides to the &s;ea. Blake, far from being di&s;couraged by this warlike di&s;po&s;ition, took the opportunity of a wind blowing into the bay; and attacked them with irre&s;i&s;tible impetuo&s;ity. After an ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, the enemy abandoned their galleons, which were &s;et on fire and de&s;troyed; and the wind &s;hifting, &s;o as to blow from the &s;hore, enabled the Engli&s;h admiral to weather the bay, where otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed to &s;uch a &s;evere fire from the forts, as in all probability would have made him repent of his ra&s;h enterprize. This great officer, in his return to England, died of the drop&s;y, to the un&s;peakable regret of Cromwell, who honoured his corp&s;e with a very magnificent funeral. Blake had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his valour and conduct, as a general in the &s;ervice of the parliament, and was turned of fifty before he commenced &s;ea-officer.

<P>Cromwell &s;eemed de&s;irous of conciliating the affection of the people by an upright admini&s;tration. The benches were filled with judges of integrity, who did ju&s;tice without re&s;pect of per&s;ons.

his implacable enemies, when he a&s;&s;umed the office of protector. Strict di&s;ci|pline was maintained among the troops. That a regular church might be main|tained, he e&s;tabli&s;hed commi&s;&s;ioners, partly eccle&s;ia&s;tics, partly laymen, who, under the name of Tryers, examined the morals and qualifications of tho&s;e who were candidates for the mini&s;try; and &s;uch as were admitted they pre&s;ented occa&s;ionally to the livings that were formerly in the gift of the crown. Full liberty of con&s;cience he allowed to all but papi&s;ts and prelati&s;ts; and even the clergy of the Engli&s;h church were le&s;s re&s;trained under his government, than they had been by the republican parliament. He bridled the royali&s;ts by his army and &s;pies, who in&s;inuated them&s;elves into all their &s;ecret councils. He was likewi&s;e well acquainted with every tran&s;action in the court of Charles; for, after the execution of Manning, he found means to corrupt Sir Richard Willis, who was in the confidence of the chancellor of the exchequer, and knew the &s;ecret de&s;igns of the king and all his adherents. He &s;eemed to be apprehen|&s;ive of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. Colonel Titus, under the name of Allen, had written a pamphlet, intitled, "Killing no murder," on purpo&s;e to in&s;tigate &s;ome per&s;on to de&s;troy the tyrant in this manner. Cromwell took occa&s;ion to declare that &s;uch a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations were ba&s;e and unmanly; and therefore he would not be the fir&s;t to practi&s;e them upon his enemies: but, &s;hould the cavaliers make any &s;uch attempt upon his life, he would find in&s;truments to exterminate the whole royal family. The admini&s;tration of Scotland was ve&s;ted in a council, con|&s;i&s;ting chiefly of Engli&s;h members, and lord Broghill was appointed pre&s;ident. In order to curb the nobility, the protector aboli&s;hed va&s;&s;alage, and revived the office of ju&s;tice of peace, which king James had introduced. He &s;upported a long line of forts and garri&s;ons, from one end of the kingdom to the other: he maintained an army of ten thou&s;and men to prevent in&s;urrection and di&s;|turbance. He favoured the pre&s;byterian clergy, though they took great free|doms with his per&s;on and government; but his emi&s;&s;aries carefully fomented the animo&s;ity that prevailed between the re&s;olutioners and prote&s;ters. At this juncture, the enemies of Cromwell had well nigh obtained the completion of all their wi&s;hes, by an accident. The count of Oldenburg having pre&s;ented him with &s;ix fine Frie&s;land coach-hor&s;es, he, for his amu&s;ement, attempted to drive his own equipage round Hyde Park, while his &s;ecretary Thurloe &s;at in the coach. The hor&s;es taking fright, galloped off with &s;uch violence of &s;peed, that he could neither manage the reins, direct their cour&s;e, nor keep his &s;eat; but falling upon the pole, was dragged along the ground; and a pi&s;tol, which he always kept in his pocket, went off in the cour&s;e of his career: yet he e&s;caped from all the&s;e perils, almo&s;t unhurt. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ludlow.</NOTE></P>

<P>The protector thought he had now e&s;tabli&s;hed his authority on &s;uch a firm ba&s;is, that it wanted nothing but the confirmation of a parliament com|po&s;ed of members from the three kingdoms; and this he accordingly convoked for the &s;eventh day of September: but he managed the elections with &s;uch dexterity, that a great majority of his friends was returned; and above one hundred members were excluded, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to &s;ign the recognition. By the fir&s;t act that was pa&s;&s;ed, they renounced Charles Stuart; by another, they decreed the penalty of high trea&s;on again&s;t any per&s;on who &s;hould make an attempt upon the life of the protector.

In the month of February, he di&s;covered a con&s;piracy hatched again&s;t his life, by one Syn|dercomb, a di&s;banded trooper, who had &s;erved in his own guards. This re|&s;olute &s;oldier had &s;everal times attempted to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the protector, and very narrowly mi&s;&s;ed his aim.

<P>Mean while the parliament continued to exhibit daily proofs of their complai&s;ance to the protector, who, on his &s;ide, &s;eemed to have changed his nature, in order to &s;ollicit popularity. He care&s;&s;ed the independents, profe&s;&s;ed a particular affection for the pre&s;byterians, and pretended to have laid a&s;ide all enmity to the nobility and royali&s;ts. Colonel Jeph&s;on, in order to &s;ound the inclinations of the parliament, moved that they &s;hould make a tender of the crown to the protector; and the members expre&s;&s;ed no &s;urprize at the pro|po&s;al: but when a more formal motion to the &s;ame purpo&s;e was made by alder|man Pack, the whole hou&s;e was filled with commotion. Lambert, on pretence of con&s;cientious motives, &s;tarted every civil and religious objection that oc|curred again&s;t the kingly government, and oppo&s;ed the motion at the head of a &s;trong party: he had entertained the hope of &s;ucceeding Cromwell in the protector&s;hip. In &s;pite of his oppo&s;ition, the motion was approved by a great majority; the bill brought in, and a committee appointed to confer with his highne&s;s, to remove the &s;cruples which might otherwi&s;e hinder him from ac|cepting the offer. The conferences on this &s;ubject la&s;ted for &s;everal days. The committee urged him with arguments and importunities, to which he re|plied in &s;uch a confu&s;ed, unintelligible manner, as plainly indicates that he did not de&s;ire to be under&s;tood. He was certainly ambitious of the crown; and, in all probability, the motion was made with his privity and concurrence: but he was &s;taggered and perplexed by the violent oppo&s;ition of Lambert and other officers. He dreaded the army, which he him&s;elf had trained to principles dia|metrically oppo&s;ite to monarchy, and even wrought up to the mo&s;t de&s;perate enthu&s;ia&s;m again&s;t the kingly name: he could not even gain over his brother|in law De&s;borough, and Fleetwood who had married his daughter. They plainly told him, they would re&s;ign their commi&s;&s;ions, &s;hould he accept of the crown; and de&s;ired he would no longer depend upon their &s;ervice and attach|ment. A petition again&s;t the office of king, &s;igned by colonel Pri$e and a great number of officers, was pre&s;ented to parliament. He was given to un|der&s;tand, that &s;everal per&s;ons had engaged in an a&s;&s;ociation to cut him off, immediately after his elevation to the royal dignity: he dreaded a mutiny among the troops; and he is &s;aid to have been influenced by a pretended pro|phecy, importing that he &s;hould be very near the throne, but never wear the diadem. He had de&s;ired time to deliberate, and appointed the eighth day of May for his an&s;wer. In this interval, while he fluctuated between fear and am|bition,
<PB N="383" REF="3850">
he is &s;aid to have undergone a vici&s;&s;itude of the mo&s;t anxious doubts and apprehen&s;ions: at length his an&s;wer implied an ab&s;olute refu&s;al.</P>

<P>The parliament acknowledged this in&s;tance of moderation, in con|firming his dignity of protector, and augmenting his power, by a &s;olemn act, intitled, "The humble petition and advice." This empowered him to name<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitelocke.

Cromwell &s;wore to the punctual execution of all the&s;e articles; and appointed the twenty-&s;ixth day of June for his inauguration, which was celebrated for the &s;econd time with great pomp and magnificence, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the fir&s;t was defective in point of validity: then the parliament adjourned it&s;elf to the twentieth day of January.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this year, the protector concluded with France a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, by which he obliged him&s;elf to &s;end a reinforcement of &s;ix thou&s;and Engli&s;h to the French army. He likewi&s;e &s;tipulated that Mardyke and Dunkirk &s;hould be be&s;ieged, and, when taken, delivered to Cromwell. King Charles, when he received the fir&s;t hint of this negotiation, &s;ent a private envoy to the archduke Leopold, governor of the Low Countries, with propo&s;als of engaging in a league with Spain; and that prince embraced the offer, in hope that the king of England would influence the Iri&s;h troops in France to quit that &s;ervice and inli&s;t in the army of his catholic maje&s;ty. They &s;oon con|cluded the treaty, by which the king was allowed to re&s;ide privately at Bru&s;|&s;els, with a pen&s;ion of &s;ix thou&s;and livres a month, and half as much for his brother the duke of Glouce&s;ter, who, after his father's death, had been &s;ent to Holland by order of the parliament: be&s;ides, the court of Spain engaged to furni&s;h Charles with &s;ix thou&s;and men, as &s;oon as he &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a good port in England. This treaty being ratified, the King quitted Co|logne, and repaired to the Low Countries, at the time when Leopold re&s;igned that government to Don John of Au&s;tria, natural &s;on of Philip IV. Lord Mu&s;kerry, who commanded an Iri&s;h regiment in France, abandoned that &s;ervice at his maje&s;ty's de&s;ire, and joined the Spani&s;h army; and four other regiments, con&s;i&s;ting of Engli&s;h, Scots, and Iri&s;h, followed his example. When the league between France and England was &s;igned, cardinal Mazarine gave the duke of York to under&s;tand, that he mu&s;t retire to another country: at the &s;ame time he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all the cavaliers who had entered into the French &s;ervice, and, among the re&s;t, the lord Digby; who, by the death of his father, was become earl of Bri&s;tol, and had by this time embraced the Roman catholic religion. Cromwell &s;ent &s;ix thou&s;and veterans into France, under the command of Reynolds, who had acted as his plenipotentiary at Paris. In this fir&s;t campaign, &s;everal places were taken from the Spaniards; and, among the&s;e Mardyke, of which the Engli&s;h troops were put in immediate po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion. Reynolds being drowned in his pa&s;&s;age to England, was &s;ucceeded in command by Lockhart, a native of Scotland, who re&s;ided as amba&s;&s;ador at Paris. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon.</NOTE></P>

<P>After the adjournment, Cromwell deprived Lambert of his commi&s;|&s;ion of lieutenant-general, which was be&s;towed upon Fleetwood; but he in|dulged him with a pen&s;ion of two thou&s;and pounds, on condition of his living quietly, without di&s;turbing the government: other officers were al&s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice, becau&s;e the protector could not depend upon their attach|ment. He now produced his elde&s;t &s;on Richard at court, as his heir apparent. He was a man of an inoffen&s;ive, unambitious character, who had been mar|ried &s;ome years, and lived in the country on a &s;mall e&s;tate, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in right of his wife: he &s;pent his time in acts of benevolence. Far from approving his father's conduct, he had, at the time of the late king's trial, fallen on his knees, and conjured him in the mo&s;t pathetic manner to &s;pare the life of his &s;overeign. His brother Henry was by this time promoted to the government of Ireland. His elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter had been married to Mr. Clay|pole, and was the darling of her father; another he be&s;towed upon the grand|&s;on and heir of the earl of Warwick; a third married lord vi&s;count Falcon|bridge; and a fourth lived in celibacy.</P>

<P>Cromwell, in order to form a &s;ort of ballance to the commons, and re&s;tore in &s;ome &s;hape the form of the antient con&s;titution, had, in the interval of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, i&s;&s;ued writs, &s;ummoning &s;ixty members to compo&s;e another hou&s;e equivalent to the hou&s;e of peers. This &s;tep he was authorized to take by the "Humble petition and advice." The&s;e writs were directed to four or five of the antient nobility, who rejected the invitation, to &s;ome gentlemen of fortune, and a number of officers who had rai&s;ed them&s;elves from the meane&s;t employments. He indulged them with the privileges which the peers had formerly enjoyed; and di&s;tingui&s;hed them by the name of "The other hou&s;e," until he and the parliament &s;hould agree to honour them with a more digni|fied appellation. The commons meeting on the twentieth day of January, a motion was made for admitting tho&s;e members who had been excluded, be|cau&s;e they refu&s;ed to &s;ign the recognition. It was approved &s;o &s;uddenly, that Cromwell had not time to find a pretence for di&s;puting a power they enjoyed by a &s;olemn act, which he him&s;elf had &s;worn to ob&s;erve; &s;o that above an hundred of his mo&s;t bitter enemies were admitted into parliament, forming a great majority in the oppo&s;ition. They began with que&s;tioning the autho|rity of the other chamber, which they &s;aid could not pretend to have a power equal to the hou&s;e of commons, from which it derived its origin and ex|i&s;tence.</P>

<P>The protector, incen&s;ed at their pre&s;umption, &s;ummoned them to Whitehall, and &s;upported the authority of the other hou&s;e with &s;uch vehe|mence of expre&s;&s;ion, that the commons, fearing immediate di&s;&s;olution, thought proper to acknowledge the other hou&s;e as an e&s;&s;ential part of parliament. Neverthele&s;s, they afterwards pre&s;umed to debate upon the petition and ad|vice; and &s;everal members affirmed, that it was null and of no effect, becau&s;e enacted under compul&s;ion, at a time when a great number of members was excluded from the hou&s;e, without any legal cau&s;e. Cromwell, perceiving that the&s;e &s;peeches tended to a repeal of the act upon which his whole authority was founded, immediately repaired to the other hou&s;e, and &s;ent for the commons. He told them, that the petition and advice was a mea&s;ure of their own: that, for his part, far from a&s;piring to the honour of being protector, he would
<PB N="385" REF="3870">
rather have lived in a cottage, and kept a flock of &s;heep, than have burthened him&s;elf with &s;uch an employment; but, as it was their de&s;ire, he did not doubt that they would have &s;upported the work of their own hands. He &s;aid there was a predominating humour among them, di&s;po&s;ing them to find every thing too high or too low; and therefore it was impo&s;&s;ible to content them, while they neglected virtue, hone&s;ty, piety, and ju&s;tice. He &s;aid, by their connivance, endeavours had been u&s;ed to form con&s;piracies in the army again&s;t the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment; that their de&s;ign was to divide the nation, and advance the intere&s;t of the king of Scotland; that &s;ome of them had actually enli&s;ted &s;ol|diers for that prince, who was then employed in making preparations for Eng|land. <Q>&startq;Since that is your purpo&s;e (added he) and &s;uch are your proceedings, I think it is high time to put an end to your &s;itting: I therefore declare this parliament di&s;&s;olved; and God be judge between you and me.&endq;</Q> Several members an&s;wered "Amen."</P>

<P>It was not without rea&s;on that Cromwell talked of con&s;piracies in favour of the king. A plot was actually formed by Mr. Mordaunt, brother to the earl of Peterborough; Sir Henry Sling&s;by, a wealthy knight of York&s;hire; and doctor Hewet, a clergyman of the church of England. They had com|municated to the king &s;uch a fea&s;ible account of this combination, that he had really made &s;ome preparations in the Low Countries, and intended to &s;end over tho&s;e four regiments which afterwards joined the Spaniards. Cromwell, having received intimation that one of his maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ions was accepted by a gentleman of the name of Stapley, who&s;e father had been one of the late king's judges, and was intimate with the protector, &s;ent for him to Whitehall; and, by dint of private remon&s;trances, prevailed upon him to di&s;cover all he knew of the con&s;piracy. He likewi&s;e gave Oliver to under&s;tand, that the marquis of Ormond had been in England, and re&s;ided three weeks in London. That noble|man had been &s;ent over by the king to learn the true &s;tate of the combination; and, finding matters not yet ripe for action, returned to the continent, without the knowledge of Cromwell. Mordaunt, Slingsby, and Hewit, together with a great number of their accomplices, were apprehended; and a high court of ju&s;tice was erected to try the&s;e con&s;pirators. Mordaunt was &s;aved by means of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1658.</NOTE> his wife, who bribed the principal evidences to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the trial: but the other two were condemned and executed. A&s;hton, Stacy, and Belle&s;ley, &s;uffered on the &s;ame account, and many others received &s;entence of death: but the protector &s;pared their lives, rather than run the ri&s;que of aug|menting the number of his enemies, which were already numerous and formi|dable. The king, about this time, received a petition, &s;igned by &s;everal inde|pendents, quakers, and anabapti&s;ts, profe&s;&s;ing their dete&s;tation of Cromwell, and offering to ri&s;que their lives and fortunes in his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, provided he would a&s;&s;ent to &s;ome propo&s;itions joined to their addre&s;s. In the&s;e they demanded, that he would re&s;tore the long parliament, confirm the conce&s;&s;ions which his father had made in the treaty of Newport; and allow every man to wor&s;hip God in his own way. Charles, who did not reli&s;h their demands, and had no great opinion of their intere&s;t, returned a general an&s;wer, importing, that he was not of a humour to per&s;ecute any per&s;on on account of his religion, and that tho&s;e who were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve him effectually, might always depend upon his favour.</P>

<P>In the month of June, marechal Turenne, who commanded the French army, undertook the &s;iege of Dunkirk, which was but indifferently provided for defence. He had no &s;ooner inve&s;ted the place, than Don John of Au&s;tria marched to its relief, re&s;olving to give battle to the be&s;iegers. The prince of Cond&eacute;, who commanded a body of his own troops as an ally of the Spaniards, advi&s;ed Don John and the marquis of Caracena to alter the di&s;po&s;ition they had made, and explained his rea&s;ons for advi&s;ing that alteration: but, his coun&s;el being rejected, he repaired to his po&s;t, and told the duke of York, who, with his brother, &s;erved as a volunteer in the Spani&s;h army, that he would pre|&s;ently &s;ee them lo&s;e a battle. Lockhart, who commanded the Engli&s;h troops, charged the Spani&s;h infantry with &s;uch vigour, that they were &s;oon broken; while their hor&s;e &s;uffered in the &s;ame manner from the French cavalry. In a word, they were totally routed: though the prince of Cond&eacute;, with his divi&s;ion, made a ma&s;terly retreat to Ypres and Furnes; whither likewi&s;e the Spaniards retired in great confu&s;ion. Turenne proceeded with the &s;iege of Dunkirk, and the gallant marquis de Leyde, the governor, being mortally wounded, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> place was &s;urrendered by capitulation. The French king entered the town in triumph, and afterwards delivered it to Lockhart, whom the protector had ap|pointed governor for the Engli&s;h.

<P>Cromwell, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch an uninterrupted &s;eries of &s;ucce&s;s, was by this time become truly mi&s;erable. He &s;aw him&s;elf dete&s;ted by all the different parties in England; and that his whole power re&s;ted upon a &s;tanding army in which his enemies had con&s;iderable influence. Plots and con&s;piracies had been formed again&s;t his life and government; he knew the de&s;perate tem|per of tho&s;e fanatics whom he him&s;elf had &s;o often practi&s;ed upon, and was ince&s;&s;antly haunted by the terrors of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. He wore defen&s;ive armour under his cloaths, and always kept a loaded pi&s;tol in his pocket. His a&s;pect became cloudy, and when a &s;tranger appeared at his court, he fixed his eyes upon him with all the eagerne&s;s of &s;u&s;picion. When he made excur&s;ions to Hampton-court, his coach was always filled with armed dome&s;tics, clo&s;ely &s;urrounded with guards, and he travelled with hurry and precipitation. He never &s;lept three nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the &s;ame chamber: he &s;hifted his lodging|room without communicating his purpo&s;e to the family; and, at the back-door of the apartment in which he lay, he ever po&s;ted centinels, in who&s;e attach|ment he could confide. He was al&s;o expo&s;ed to family-di&s;quiets that preyed upon his &s;pirits. Fleetwood was aver&s;e to his power from principle, and had converted his wife to his opinion. His favourite daughter Claypole had lately died of a langui&s;hing di&s;order, during which &s;he, in divers conferences, had awakened the horrors of his guilty con&s;cience. All the&s;e circum&s;tances con|curring with the continual agitation of his &s;pirits from the multiplicity of af|fairs<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitelocke.</NOTE> in which he was engaged, had a violent effect on his con&s;titution. In the month of Augu&s;t he was &s;eized with a tertian ague at Hampton-Court; and, the &s;ymptoms increa&s;ing, he was removed to Whitehall, where he began to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lodlow.</NOTE> reflect upon his pa&s;t life, and prepare for his di&s;&s;olution. When his chaplain, Goodwin, told him the elect would never fall into reprobation, he replied, "Then I am &s;afe; for I am &s;ure I was once in a &s;tate of grace." He was &s;o much encouraged by the vi&s;ions and pretended revelations of his fanatical prea|chers,
<PB N="387" REF="3890">
that he believed he &s;hould certainly recover, even when the phy&s;icians de&s;paired of his life. <Q>&startq;I tell you (cried he) with emotion, I &s;hall not die of this di&s;temper: favourable an&s;wers have been returned by heaven, not only to my own &s;upplications, but likewi&s;e to tho&s;e of the godly, who carry on a more intimate corre&s;pondence with the Lord.&endq;</Q> Upon a fa&s;t-day, appointed on account of his di&s;temper, the mini&s;ters thanked God for the undoubted pledges they had received of the protector's recovery.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXI.</HEAD>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e a&s;&s;urances his &s;ymptoms became more and more violent, and the phy&s;icians declared the next fit would put a period to his life. Then the council &s;ent a deputation to know his plea&s;ure with regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He was almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, when they asked if it was his plea&s;ure that his elde&s;t &s;on Richard &s;hould &s;ucceed him in the protector&s;hip; and all the an&s;wer he could make was a &s;imple affirmative. He expired on the third day of September, the anniver&s;ary of the victories he had obtained at Dunbar and Worce&s;ter; and his death was rendered remarkable by one of the mo&s;t violent tempe&s;ts which had blown in the memory of man, as if nature had intended to celebrate the fate of &s;uch an extraordinary per&s;on. Cromwell died in the fifty-ninth year of his age, leaving all Europe in a&s;toni&s;hment at the in|cidents of his fortune. We have already ob&s;erved that he was de&s;cended of a good family in Huntingdon&s;hire. His father died while he was young; but his mother &s;urvived his elevation to the protector&s;hip. She was a virtuous woman, of the name of Stuart, and &s;aid to be related to the royal family. Oliver was of a robu&s;t make and con&s;titution, and his a&s;pect was manly though clowni&s;h. His education extended no farther than a &s;uperficial knowledge of the Latin tongue: but he inherited great talents from nature; though they were &s;uch as he could not have exerted to advantage at any other juncture than that of a civil war inflamed by religious conte&s;ts. His character was formed from an amazing conjunction of enthu&s;ia&s;m, hypocri&s;y, and ambition. He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of courage and re&s;olution that overlooked all danger, and &s;aw no difficulty. He dived into the characters of mankind with wonderful &s;agacity; while he con|cealed his own purpo&s;es under the impenetrable &s;hield of di&s;&s;imulation. He recon|ciled the mo&s;t atrocious crimes to the mo&s;t rigid notions of religious obligation. From the &s;evere&s;t exerci&s;e of devotion he relaxed into the mo&s;t ludicrous and idle buffoonery. He pre&s;erved the dignity and di&s;tance of his character in the mid&s;t of the coar&s;e&s;t familiarity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>When he had a point to carry in the army, he conde&s;cended to take corporals and &s;erjeants to his bed, where he plied them with religious exerci&s;e and di&s;cour&s;e. Among his friends he je&s;ted and compo&s;ed doggrel rhimes. At a meet|ing of the republican chiefs, and the general of|ficers, to concert the model of a free govern|ment, Cromwell, by way of joke, threw a cu&s;hion at the head of Ludlow, who returned the com|pliment, and chaced him down &s;tairs. In &s;ign|ing the king's &s;entence, he in a frolic be&s;meared the face of Harry Martin with ink, and Martin bedaubed him in the &s;ame manner. He fre|quently invited his inferior officers to entertain|ments, and when the di&s;hes were &s;et upon the table, a number of &s;oldiers would ru&s;h in and carry off the victuals. There was no &s;plendour or magnificence in his court, which the nobility di&s;dained to honour with their pre&s;ence: but his oeconomy was well regulated: all the per|&s;ons he employed at home and abroad, were men of uncommon ability, and acted with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;pirit for the honour of the nation. He inter|po&s;ed &s;o effectually in favour of the prote&s;tants in the valley of Lucerne, and tho&s;e of Ni&s;mes and Languedoc, who were in actual rebellion again&s;t their princes, and in imminent danger of being extirpated, at the in&s;tigation of the pope, that they were pardoned and re&s;tored to all their pri|vileges; while his holine&s;s trembled at the me|naces of the protector, who gave him to under|&s;tand, that his fleet &s;hould vi&s;it Civita Vecchia, in &s;uch a manner that Rome would refound with the noi&s;e of the Briti&s;h cannon. Cromwell was not altogether in&s;en&s;ible to literary merit. He granted a pen&s;ion to archbi&s;hop U&s;her, though of the oppo&s;ite party: he retained Andrew Mar|vel in his &s;ervice; he care&s;&s;ed Waller, to whom he was related. He gave one hundred pounds a year to the profe&s;&s;or of divinity at Oxford; and the celebrated John Milton was his &s;ecretary for the Latin tongue; though his immen&s;e genius was but little known even to his employers; for he is mentioned by Whitelocke as an ob&s;cure blind man, very unfit for his office.</P>

<P>This age likewi&s;e produced Sir William Da|ven$$t, Sir John Denham, and Cowley, who, though indifferent poets, acquired a good &s;hare of reputation. The republican &s;pirit of the times gave birth to the Oceana of Harrington, con|taining the plan of an ideal commonwealth; and the controver&s;ies and ab&s;urdities that deformed religion, encouraged Hobbes to write and publi&s;h his Leviathan.</P>
<P>Among the &s;ects produced in the reign of Charles, one of the mo&s;t remarkable was that of the quakers, which was founded by George Fox, the &s;on of a weaver at Drayton in Lanca&s;hire. This enthu&s;ia&s;t was bound apprentice to a &s;hoe|maker; but, having a turn to &s;piritual contem|plations, he quitted this mechanical profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;trolled about the country in a leathern doublet. That he might not be interrupted in his &s;ublime meditations, he wandered in woods, lodged in hollow trees, and read the Bible without cea&s;ing. At length he believed him&s;elf in&s;pired, and began to di&s;regard the &s;cripture as a dead letter. He now a&s;&s;umed the character of an apo&s;tle; and, returning to the world, exerted his talents in making pro&s;elytes. The fanati|ci&s;m of the times a&s;&s;i&s;ted his endeavours, in which he met with extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s. He and his di&s;ciples were &s;eized with &s;uch violent tran&s;|ports of enthu&s;ia&s;m, as threw them into contor|&s;ions, and univer&s;al trepidation, from whence they derived the name of quakers. Their pe|culiarities in manners and doctrine are &s;o well known as to need no de&s;cription. They were &s;everely per&s;ecuted, confined in pri&s;ons and mad hou&s;es, reviled, &s;courged, and &s;et in the pillory; but they &s;uffered with &s;uch patience and equani|mity, as excited the admiration of mankind. They renounced all rites and ceremonies of re|ligion; and pretended to be directed by the im|mediate illumination of the &s;pirit. One of this &s;ect peri&s;hed in attempting to fa&s;t forty days, as Chri&s;t fa&s;ted in the wilderne&s;s. A female quaker appeared naked in a church before Cromwell the protector, &s;aying, &s;he was moved by the &s;pirit to appear as a &s;ign to the people. A good num|ber believing that the renovation of all things had commenced, threw away their cloaths as &s;u|perfluities. James Naylor fancied him&s;elf the &s;aviour of the world: he pretended to rai&s;e a per&s;on from the dead: he made a public entry into Bri&s;tol, mounted on a hor&s;e, while his di&s;|ciples &s;pread their garments before him, crying, <Q>&startq;Ho&s;anna to the highe&s;t! holy, holy, is the Lord God of Sabbaoth.&endq;</Q> When examined by the magi&s;trate, he made no other an&s;wer to all que&s;tions, but this, "Thou ha&s;t &s;aid it." They condemned him to be &s;et on the pillory; he was &s;courged, branded in the face, and a red hot iron thru&s;t through his tongue. The&s;e in|flictions he bore with patience, nay, even with exultation; but, when he was confined to Bride|well, kept to hard labour, fed upon bread and water, and debarred the company of his di&s;ciples, his illu&s;ions vani&s;hed; and, being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed as an ordinary man, he returned to his original oc|cupation.</P>

temperate from inclination: perplexed and de&s;picable in his di&s;cour&s;e; clear and con&s;ummate in his de&s;igns: ridiculous in his reveries; re&s;pectable in his conduct: in a word, the &s;trange&s;t compound of villainy and virtue, ba&s;ene&s;s and magnanimity, $ab&s;urdity and good &s;en&s;e, that we find upon record in the annals of mankind.</P>

<P>Immediately after the decea&s;e of Cromwell the council a&s;&s;embled; and, in con&s;equence of his la&s;t will, elected his &s;on Richard protector of the com|monwealth. This election was notified to the mayor of London, and next day he was proclaimed in that city and in We&s;tmin&s;ter. Far from meeting with oppo&s;ition, he in a little time received addre&s;&s;es from the different counties and corporations of England, congratulating him upon his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which they promi&s;ed to &s;upport with life and fortune. After having been in|&s;talled, and taken the oath, he, in order to &s;ecure the attachment of general Monk, who had rendered him&s;elf ab&s;olute in Scotland, &s;ent thither that offi|cer's
<PB N="589" REF="3910">
brother-in-law Clarges, with a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip and regard. Monk received them with profe&s;&s;ions of acknowledgment and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. As Richard had conde&s;cended to a&s;k his advice, he coun&s;elled him to employ none but pious and moderate mini&s;ters in the church; to hinder the officers from caballing together; and exert his endeavours to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the army. He had no rea&s;on to doubt the affection of the troops, ina&s;much as every regiment in the &s;ervice had, in addre&s;&s;es, a&s;&s;ured him of their inviolable attachment. Mean while he expended a con&s;iderable &s;um of money on the funeral of his father, who was magnificently interred in the chapel of Henry VII. among the kings and princes of England. The parties were grown &s;o re&s;tle&s;s and head|&s;trong before the protector's death, that he him&s;elf, with all his power and ca|pacity, could hardly keep them in &s;ubjection. Much le&s;s could they be go|verned by Richard, who had nothing active in his di&s;po&s;ition, no talents for bu&s;ine&s;s, no knowledge of government, no acquaintance with the army, no ambition of power, no importance of character. The general a&s;&s;ent to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was no other than a temporary acquie&s;cence, until each party could concert its mea&s;ures, and act effectually for its own intere&s;t.</P>

<P>The new protector, that his power might have the proper &s;anction, convoked a parliament for the three kingdoms, con&s;i&s;ting, like the la&s;t, of two hou&s;es; and in the mean time con&s;ulted with his particular friends, about means for keeping his council and army in dependence upon his authority. His confederates were men in civil employments, who, without con&s;idering the change of circum&s;tances, advi&s;ed him to &s;upport to its full extent, the au|thority which he inherited from his father, and the plan of government he had e&s;tabli&s;hed. His uncle De&s;borough was a republican, and his brother Fleetwood an enthu&s;ia&s;tic millenarian, con&s;equently both aver&s;e to the govern|ment of a &s;ingle per&s;on. Fleetwood was the idol of the army, which Ri|chard di&s;obliged by the promotion of &s;ome officers again&s;t whom they enter|tained a di&s;like. Lambert and Ludlow, with many other officers whom Oliver had laid a&s;ide, came forth from their retreats, and began to cabal again&s;t the pro|tector. Some of his di&s;gui&s;ed enemies per&s;uaded him that it would be his in|tere&s;t to a&s;&s;emble a good number of officers at London, to overawe the de|liberations of the parliament, in ca&s;e it &s;hould prove refractory. He fell into the &s;nare, and ordered all the officers that could be &s;pared from their regiments to repair to London. The&s;e con&s;tituted a numerous a&s;&s;embly, which met frequently, and a&s;&s;umed the name of "The great council of the army." Being actuated by De&s;borough and his a&s;&s;ociates, they pre&s;ented a petition to the protector, demanding that no member of the army &s;hould be &s;ubject to the civil magi&s;trate; and that the officers &s;hould enjoy the privilege of chu&s;ing their own general. Richard, &s;hocked at their pre&s;umption, rejected their reque&s;ts, and even threatened to di&s;mi&s;s them from the &s;ervice, &s;hould they make &s;uch extravagant propo&s;als for the future. Their directors en|couraged this petition, on purpo&s;e that the officers might &s;uffer a repul&s;e, which would provoke their re&s;entment; and they were not di&s;appointed in their expectation.</P>

<P>When the parliament met on the twenty-&s;eventh day of January, they called in que&s;tion the right which the Scots and Iri&s;h arrogated, in &s;end|ing members to the hou&s;e; and, like their predece&s;&s;ors, they began to examine
<PB N="390" REF="3920">
the authority of the other hou&s;e. After tedious debates, it was agreed by a majority of votes, that the other hou&s;e &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t; and the Scotti&s;h and Iri&s;h members sit in parliament. Then they pa&s;&s;ed an act, confirming Richard's<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1659.</NOTE> title of protector. In the mean time the council of officers pre&s;ented another petition, demanding that Fleetwood &s;hould be appointed general of the army. The protector an&s;wered this with uncommon acrimony, and ordered them to return to their quarters. The commons, dreading their de&s;igns, voted that no council of officers &s;hould be held during the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament; and that no per&s;on &s;hould be permitted to exerci&s;e an employment in the army, until after he &s;hould have taken an oath that he would not interrupt the deliberations of the commons. But the&s;e votes were rejected by the other hou&s;e, compo&s;ed chiefly of officers; and the council were continued, without any regard to the orders of the protector, who had now lo&s;t all authority, and brought his ad|mini&s;tration into contempt. On the twenty-&s;econd day of April, he was be|leaguered in Whitehall by a body of officers; and De&s;borough penetrating to his apartment with an armed retinue, demanded, in the name of the army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whitelock. Clarendon. Baker. Ludlow.</NOTE> that he would di&s;&s;olve the parliament. He was obliged to comply with their de&s;ire; and, as the commons had adjourned the hou&s;e for three days, he di&s;|&s;olved them by proclamation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="25" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXV.</HEAD>
<P>The officers re&s;olved to &s;ettle the government, without taking the lea&s;t notice of Richard, who was now con&s;idered as a private per&s;on. They elected Fleetwood for their general; re&s;tored Lambert, Ludlow, and the other officers whom Oliver had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and broke five colonels, who had advi&s;ed Richard to &s;upport the parliament. The&s;e were Ingold&s;by, Goffe, Whalley, lord Fal|conbridge, and Howard afterwards earl of Carlile. The council of officers always met at Wallingford-hou&s;e, which belonged to Fleetwood, whom they &s;eemed de&s;irous of rai&s;ing to the protector&s;hip: but Lambert, who was a man of deep de&s;ign and a&s;piring ambition, re&s;olved to counterwork the intere&s;t of Fleetwood by private cabals, while he cajoled him to his face with the mo&s;t flat|tering expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and veneration. For this purpo&s;e he employed colonel Lilburne to intrigue among the independents of the army, who ab|horred the protector&s;hip. A great number of the&s;e being inferior officers, a&s;&s;embled at St. James's, to con&s;ult about the regulation of the government; there they began to extol the admini&s;tration of the independent parliament, which had brought their king to the &s;caffold, and de&s;troyed the con&s;titution of their country. They were joined by Ludlow, countenanced by Sir Henry Vane, Sir Arthur Ha$lerig, and all the tribe of republicans, anabapti&s;ts, millenarians, and other fanatics that &s;warmed in the army. In a word, they became &s;o powerful, that the council of Wallingford-hou&s;e thought proper to join them in "the good old cau&s;e:" &s;o they termed the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of that rem|nant which Oliver had &s;o di&s;gracefully di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Before this union of the officers took effect, tho&s;e of Wallingford-hou&s;e, in a conference with Vane, Ha$lerig, Scot, Solway, and other members of the old parliament, had in&s;i&s;ted upon their being &s;ecured by an act of indemnity; but were obliged to re&s;t contented with a verbal promi&s;e, by which tho&s;e members engaged to u&s;e their endeavours for that purpo&s;e. All the&s;e &s;teps being taken, Lambert, accom|panied by a great number of officers, repaired to the hou&s;e of Lenthal, who had been &s;peaker in the long parliament, and pre&s;ented him with a declaration
<PB N="391" REF="3930">
of the military council, by which he and the other members were invited to re-a&s;&s;emble. Accordingly, on the eighth day of May, they met in the hou&s;e, to the number of two and forty; and the pre&s;byterian members, who had been formerly excluded, attempted to re&s;ume their &s;eats; but they would not admit of &s;uch trouble&s;ome a&s;&s;ociates; and the army &s;upported them in the renunciation of tho&s;e members. This a&s;&s;embly was &s;o hated for their former tyranny, that the people in general could not help deriding them under the de|nomination of "the rump;" in allu&s;ion to their being the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable and ignoble part of the parliament.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep taken by them, was to tamper with the officers under Monk in Scotland, while they &s;ent thither Clarges to per&s;uade him to acknowledge the new government. They knew he hated them in his heart; but &s;uch was his influence among the troops, and the whole Scotti&s;h people, by whom he was generally beloved for his impartial and mild admini&s;tration, that the parliament would not venture to deprive him of his office. The change of government was &s;o &s;udden and unexpected, that Monk had not time to regulate his conduct; and when he began to &s;ound his officers, he found them already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by letters from their friends in London. He therefore acquie&s;ced in the authority of his new ma&s;ters. Immediately after the parliament rea&s;&s;em|bled, Lambert pre&s;ented an addre&s;s in the name of the general council of officers, petitioning, That they would pa&s;s an act of indemnity in favour of tho&s;e who had been in&s;trumental in the late changes of government: That all chri&s;tians &s;hould be indulged with liberty of con&s;cience, except papi&s;ts, prelati&s;ts, and li|bertines: That all cavaliers &s;hould be for ever excluded from the magi&s;tracy or public employments of any kind: That mea&s;ures &s;hould be taken to pre|vent the danger from the power's being too long ve&s;ted in one parliament: That they would confirm lord Charles Fleetwood in the office of general in chief of all the land-forces belonging to the commonwealth: That the legi&s;|lative power &s;hould re&s;ide in a repre&s;entative of the people; and the executive part of government be intru&s;ted to a council of &s;tate, compo&s;ed of able, pious, and faithful members: That they would di&s;charge the debts of his highne&s;s Richard Cromwell; and grant &s;uitable pen&s;ions for him and his mother, that po&s;terity might &s;ee the great re&s;pect they payed to the memory of their renowned general Oliver Cromwell, to which the &s;tate had owed &s;uch &s;ignal obligations. The parliament thanked the officers for their affection to the public; though they did not at all reli&s;h &s;ome articles of their addre&s;s. They dete&s;ted the family of Cromwell; but they were afraid of di&s;obliging their con&s;tituents. A deputation from their hou&s;e waited upon Richard, to know whether or not he acquie&s;ced in the change of government; and he &s;ignified his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in writing. Neverthele&s;s, they refu&s;ed to pay the debt which he had contracted for his father's funeral; but they accommodated him with two thou&s;and pounds, and ordered him to leave Whitehall in &s;ix days.</P>

<DIV4 N="27" TYPE="section">

<P>They appointed Fleetwood commander in chief; but, limited his commi&s;&s;ion to one year; they ordained, that all commi&s;&s;ions &s;hould be &s;igned by the &s;peaker of the hou&s;e; they voted, That Ireland &s;hould be go|verned by commi&s;&s;ioners appointed in parliament; and recalled Henry Crom|well to London. He obeyed the order with a good grace, though he might have given them abundance of trouble; for, he had great influence among the
<PB N="392" REF="3940">
troops in that kingdom; and was beloved by the people for his mild and up|right admini&s;tration. The parliament dreading the power of the &s;uperior of|ficers, a good number of whom they knew were aver&s;e to their government, began to new-model the army. The committee for examining commi&s;&s;ions, ca&s;hiered many officers whom they &s;u&s;pected; and filled their places with others, in whom they could confide. They would have practi&s;ed the &s;ame method with the troops under Monk; but, he was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of their intention, than he wrote letters to the parliament, complaining of their de&s;ign to &s;ap his authority; and hinting, that it would not be for their intere&s;t to drive him to extremity. They did not think it prudent to quarrel with an officer of his ability, at the head of twelve thou&s;and veterans, &s;upported by the whole Scotti&s;h nation; and therefore, they recalled the commi&s;&s;ions they had granted. They continued the tax of five and thirty thou&s;and pounds a-month, which had been impo&s;ed by the parliament during Oliver's protector&s;hip. They<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon. Baker$ Wh$tlock.</NOTE> appointed commi&s;&s;ioners for the civil government of Ireland; and be&s;towed the chief command of the forces in that kingdom upon Edmund Ludlow, an experienced officer and rigid republican.</P>

<P>Having received intimation of a de&s;ign in favour of the king, they ordered all cavaliers to quit London. This &s;tep was not unnece&s;&s;ary. Charles had impowered commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with tho&s;e, who, though they had acted again&s;t his father or him&s;elf, were now willing to return to their duty. The&s;e agents had met with extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s. The people were &s;ick of a tyranny e&s;tabli&s;hed by two and forty independents, the de&s;picable rem|nant of tho&s;e who had en&s;laved their country; and they were as much di&s;gu&s;ted with an army of fanatics and hypocrites, who, on pretence of extending the kingdom of Chri&s;t, had pro&s;ecuted their own &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es, and committed the mo&s;t flagrant acts of in&s;olence, cruelty, and oppre&s;&s;ion. The pre&s;byterians were no friends to monarchy, unle&s;s curtailed of almo&s;t all its prerogatives; but, they were &s;till more aver&s;e to the independents, and eagerly &s;ought the ruin of that dete&s;ted party, even though at the expence of &s;eeing the royal family re&s;tored. They therefore re&s;olved to co-operate with the cavaliers. Colonel Mordaunt re&s;olved to hazard his life once more for the &s;ervice of his &s;overeign. He projected a plan for &s;urpri&s;ing at one time Glouce&s;ter, Lyme, Plymouth, Exeter, and Che&s;ter. The &s;cheme was approved by the king, who repaired in &s;ecret to St. Malo, that he might be at hand, in ca&s;e the enterprize &s;hould &s;ucceed. But, the whole de&s;ign was defeated by the treachery of Sir Richard Willis, who imparted it to Thurloe, by whom it was communicated to the council of &s;tate. The militia of the different counties was immediately put into the hands of officers upon whom the parliament could depend; and &s;uch other pre|cautions taken as rendered the execution of the &s;cheme altogether impracticable. Ma$$ey was taken in attempting to &s;urpri&s;e Glouce&s;ter; but he e&s;caped from his keepers: lord Willoughby and Horatio Town&s;hend were arre&s;ted on the road to the we&s;tern counties. Sir George Booth, with five hundred men, actu|ally took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Che&s;ter, and publi&s;hed a declaration again&s;t the tyranny of the parliament, without mentioning the king's name. He was joined by Sir Thomas Middleton; but, Lambert marching again&s;t them with a detachment of the army, by order of the commons, they were quickly routed. Sir George
<PB N="393" REF="3950">
Booth e&s;caped from the field, but he was afterwards di&s;covered in woman's attire, and conveyed to the Tower of London.</P>

<P>This victory in&s;pired the parliament with &s;uch extraordinary cou|rage, that they ventured to confirm the alterations they had formerly made in Monk's army: and this officer was &s;o much offended, that in a letter to the &s;peaker he demanded his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; but, his brother-in-law Dr. Clarges u&s;ed &s;uch arguments with Lenthal, that it was never communicated to the parlia|ment. The conduct of Monk was &s;o my&s;terious at this juncture, that one would be apt to think he had not yet determined in what manner he &s;hould act. The parti&s;ans of the king took it for granted, that he &s;ecretly favoured the royal cau&s;e; and, upon that &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;ent his own brother, who was a clergyman and royali&s;t, with propo&s;als in favour of his &s;overeign: but, he declined treating on the &s;ubject, and behaved towards his brother with impene|trable re&s;erve and &s;eeming indifference.</P>

<P>The principal officers at London perceiving that the intention of the parliament was to en&s;lave the army, held &s;everal conferences, to concert mea&s;ures for preventing the execution of this de&s;ign; and their deliberations were &s;till influenced by Lambert, though he was then quartered in the north of England. Knowing that the inferior officers of the troops about London were devoted to the parliament, he tampered with tho&s;e under his command &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that they were prevailed upon to &s;ign a petition to parliament, demanding, That they would comply with the contents of the addre&s;s formerly pre&s;ented by the council of Wallingford-hou&s;e: That they would e&s;tabli&s;h ge|neral Fleetwood in his command, which, according to his pre&s;ent commi&s;&s;ion, would expire in a few months: That Lambert &s;hould be appointed lieutenant|general, De&s;borough general of the cavalry, and Monk general of the infantry: That they would take vengeance on tho&s;e communities which had a&s;&s;i&s;ted the enemy in the late in&s;urrections; and regulate the corporations in &s;uch a man|ner, as to exclude from the magi&s;tracy all but &s;uch as had expre&s;&s;ed their affection for a commonwealth. This petition, dated at Derby, was commu|nicated to Fleetwood for his approbation, before it &s;hould be pre&s;ented to par|liament; but, Sir Arthur Ha&s;lerig having received intimation of their &s;cheme, communicated his intelligence to the hou&s;e. Fleetwood being interrogated upon this &s;ubject, owned the de&s;ign; and three officers who brought it to town, delivered a copy of the petition to the &s;peaker. The hou&s;e having taken the &s;ub&s;tance of it into deliberation, voted, That to have other officers than tho&s;e appointed by parliament, would be u&s;ele&s;s, chargeable, and danger|ous to the commonwealth.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="31" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this mark of di&s;approbation, the officers drew up another addre&s;s, which was pre&s;ented to De&s;borough. In this, though they profe&s;&s;ed adherence to the parliament, they complained of mi&s;repre&s;entations; and in many articles &s;upported the petition from Derby. They al&s;o demanded, That the arrears of the army &s;hould be payed: That provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for maimed &s;oldiers, widows, and orphans: That no officer &s;hould be ca&s;hiered<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon. Baker. Whitelock.</NOTE> but by the &s;entence of a court-martial, except in ca&s;e of reduction: and, That none &s;hould be admitted but &s;uch as were examined and &s;ound duly qualified. The hou&s;e was extremely di&s;&s;atisfied at the nature of this addre&s;s; but, being in no condition to act with a high hand, they thanked the petitioners for this
<PB N="394" REF="3960">
expre&s;&s;ion of their affection and fidelity; and gave them to under&s;tand, that the parliament had already begun to take mea&s;ures for the &s;atisfaction of the army. Neverthele&s;s, having received letters from Monk, filled with pro|fe&s;&s;ions of attachment and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they ventured to an&s;wer every di&s;tinct article of the petition, in a different &s;tile. They declared, That the officers had complained without cau&s;e; and, That the parliament did not think them&s;elves obliged to give an account of their conduct. The officers now thought they could not recede with &s;afety; and they re&s;olved either to &s;ubdue or di&s;&s;olve the parliament. For this purpo&s;e Lambert approached London with his brigade; and the hou&s;e pa&s;&s;ed an act, declaring all tho&s;e guilty of high-trea&s;on who &s;hould rai&s;e money on the &s;ubject, without the con&s;ent of parliament. Having received a&s;&s;urances from Monk, that he would &s;upport them, and was already on his march from Scotland, they ca&s;hired Lambert, De&s;borough, and &s;ome other officers who had &s;igned the petition; revoked Fleetwood's commi&s;&s;ion, and appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to govern the army for a limited time: but, the army payed no regard to the&s;e re&s;olutions. The council of &s;tate &s;ent for two regiments, commanded by officers in whom they could confide, to take up their quarters in We&s;tmin&s;ter, and guard the parliament; but Lambert entering London with four regiments, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the avenues to the par|liament, on the thirteenth day of October, reconducted the &s;peaker to his own hou&s;e, and excluded the members. At night, the two regiments that were well affected to the parliament, retired from their po&s;ts, which were immediately occupied by Fleetwood: next day the malecontents ca&s;hiered the officers of tho&s;e two regiments, and filled up their places with others, whom the &s;oldiers received without he&s;itation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="32" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>Having thus &s;eized the admini&s;tration into their own hands, they formed a council of ten, to provide for the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions of the com|monwealth. They cho&s;e Fleetwood for their general, Lambert for their lieu|tenant, and De&s;borough for general of the cavalry. A council of &s;even was impowered to di&s;tribute commi&s;&s;ions; and the &s;evere&s;t di&s;cipline was ob&s;erved. They &s;ent colonel Cobbet to Monk, that he might endeavour to engage that officer in their party; but, &s;hould his remon&s;trances prove ineffectual, he had in&s;tructions to &s;educe his troops, and, if po&s;&s;ible, arre&s;t his per&s;on. Dr. Clarges did not fail to make Monk previou&s;ly acquainted with Cobbet's commi&s;&s;ion. Dur|ing this anarchy that prevailed in England, the king &s;et out for Fontarabia, that he might be pre&s;ent at the treaty which was now brought upon the carpet, for a pacification between France and Spain; but, before he reached St. John de<NOTE PLACE="marg">C$arendon.</NOTE> Luz, the peace of the Pyrenees was concluded. Don Lewis de Haro prime|mini&s;ter of Spain, received him with great ho&s;pitality: he even pre&s;ented him with a &s;um of money; but, cardinal Mazarine refu&s;ed to &s;ee him, that he might give no umbrage to the parliament of England; and Charles returned to Bru&s;&s;els. On the twenty-&s;ixth day of October, the council of officers ap|pointed a committee of &s;afety, in which they ve&s;ted the power of the admini&s;|tration. The principal members were Fleetwood, De&s;borough, Lambert, Ludlow, and Sir Henry Vane, who though a member of parliament, had lately e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the army. At the &s;ame time, the officers publi&s;hed a declaration, annulling the late orders of parliament; and declaring, that far from &s;etting up a military government, they had e&s;tabli&s;hed a committee of
<PB N="395" REF="3970">
&s;afety, which was injoined to deliberate and propo&s;e a form of legi&s;lature, that &s;hould be proper to maintain the liberties of the &s;ubject, and the happine&s;s of the commonwealth, without king, &s;ingle governor, or hou&s;e of peers.</P>

<P>Monk had by this time, in all probability, re&s;olved to fol|low the dictates of his affection to the royal family. He expected to be joined by the pre&s;byterians, who had been &s;everely oppre&s;&s;ed by the indepen|dents: he was a&s;&s;ured of the cavaliers; and did not doubt of being able to gain over part of the army in England; but, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to act with &s;ecre&s;y and circum&s;pection, and proceed for &s;ome time under colour of re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the parliament. He a&s;&s;embled his troops from the different parts of Scotland; di&s;mi&s;&s;ed &s;ome officers whom he knew aver&s;e to his de&s;igns; impri|&s;oned Cobbet in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh; found means to &s;ecure the town of Berwick in his intere&s;t; and demanded of the Scots an extraordinary &s;upply for the purpo&s;es of his expedition. During the&s;e preparations, Clarges arrived in Scotland with propo&s;als for a treaty between him and the committee of &s;afety. By the advice of this gentleman, he con&s;ented to a negotiation, in order to gain time; and &s;ent three of his officers, namely, Wilkes, Cloberry, and Knight, as commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the committee, though they were expre&s;sly or|dered to &s;tart &s;uch ob&s;tacles as would protract the negotiation. They found Lambert at York with a body of forces, to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of Monk, whom he hated as a rival in military fame and preferment. He &s;aid, he was &s;ufficiently authori&s;ed to treat with them; but, when they demanded the re&s;to|ration of the parliament, he owned he had no in&s;tructions on that article; and they proceeded to London, where the committee immediately a&s;&s;ented to all their propo&s;als. The treaty was accordingly &s;igned on the fifteenth day of November; both &s;ides engaging to act vigorou&s;ly in oppo&s;ition to Charles Stuart.</P>

<DIV4 N="34" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>Monk was chagrined at the precipitation of his deputies, and delayed ratifying the treaty, on pretence that they had deviated from their in|&s;tructions. From this circum&s;tance the committee &s;u&s;pected his de&s;ign. The members of the parliament who had compo&s;ed the council of &s;tate, a&s;&s;embling privately, expedited a commi&s;&s;ion, appointing Monk commander in chief of all the forces in England, Scotland, and Ireland. The governor of Port&s;mouth admitted into the place, Ha&s;lerig, Morley, and Walton; and declared for the parliament. A detachment of the army &s;ent thither by the committee to block up the town, abandoned their officers, and joined the governor. Their exam|ple was followed by another body of troops, detached on the &s;ame &s;ervice: while vice-admiral Law&s;on publicly e&s;pou&s;ed the parliament's intere&s;t; and &s;ailed into the river Thames to overawe the committee and their adherents. Lambert informed of the&s;e tran&s;actions, &s;ent a regiment to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friends in London; but when they arrived at St. Alban's, they revolted to the parliment: Ha&s;lerig, Walton, and Morley, began their march for London, at the head of tho&s;e very troops which had abandoned their leaders. Such a concurrence of di&s;a&s;ters, intirely broke the &s;pirit of the committee. They dur&s;t not a&s;&s;emble the army, for fear of &s;eeing more dangerous in&s;tances of defec|tion; and they took no precautions for their own defence. Whitelocke advi&s;ed Fleetwood either to put him&s;elf at the head of the army, or effect an accommoda|tion with the king. He &s;eemed to reli&s;h this la&s;t part of the alternative; but
<PB N="396" REF="3980">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon. Baker. W$$telock. L$dlow.</NOTE> he afterwards changed his opinion, and remained inactive. At length, he and his colleagues con&s;ented to the re&s;toration of the parliament; and re&s;igned the authority they had u&s;urped. On the twenty-&s;ixth day of December, the mem|bers a&s;&s;embling, appointed a committee for governing the army in their name and under their direction: then they &s;ent expre&s;s orders to Lambert, to di&s;tri|bute his forces into quarters; but, they had already, upon the news of the revo|lution at London, confined their general, who was &s;ent pri&s;oner to the Tower of London: Sir Harry Vane and &s;ome other members, who joined the army, were likewi&s;e confined to their own hou&s;es.</P>

<P>Monk having received a &s;upply of thirty thou&s;and pounds from the Scots, and taken proper precautions for maintaining the peace of that kingdom, entered England on the &s;econd day of January. In a few days he received a letter from the &s;peaker, informing him of the parliament's being re&s;tored, thanking him for his good intentions, and giving him to under&s;tand that he might &s;ave him&s;elf the trouble of coming to London, as they were al|ready in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their authority. Notwith&s;tanding this intimation, he proceeded on his march, pretending that he would reduce the mutinous army to obedience under the legi&s;lative power. Lord Fairfax, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of York, that it might not fall into the hands of the committee of &s;afety, admitted Monk without he&s;itation, and they frequently conferred together; &s;o that, in all probability, Monk acted in concert with the pre&s;by|terian party, of which Fairfax was the chief. Notwith&s;tanding Monk's di&s;|&s;imulation, the members of the rump were too &s;agacious not to perceive that he certainly had &s;ome &s;ecret de&s;ign which he indu&s;triou&s;ly concealed from their knowledge: but, whether it was to follow the foot&s;teps of Oliver Cromwell, or to re&s;tore the king, they could not yet determine. They e&s;tabli&s;hed a council of &s;tate, compo&s;ed of nine and twenty members, of which Monk was one. They ordered each to take an oath, renouncing the title of Charles Stuart, profe&s;&s;ing fidelity to the parliament and commonwealth, and engaging to oppo&s;e the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;ingle governor and hou&s;e of peers. Then they &s;ent Scot and Robin&s;on, as their deputies, under pretence of doing honour to Monk, though, in effect, they were intended as &s;pies upon his conduct. They met him at Leice&s;ter, where he, that very day, in their pre&s;ence, received an addre&s;s from the city of London, exhorting him to re&s;tore the members whom the independents had expelled from parliament before the late king's trial. Scot interrupted the deputy from London, while he recited this petition, and &s;aid, it tended to the de&s;truction of a republican parliament. Neverthe|le&s;s, Monk received it graciou&s;ly: and many other addre&s;&s;es to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e were pre&s;ented to him, in his march from Scotland. To the&s;e he made no other an&s;wer, than that he would communicate their contents to the parliament: he was &s;till under an indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;&s;embling, le&s;t the commons and army &s;hould unite for his de&s;truction.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="36" TYPE="section">

<P>When he reached St. Alban's, he &s;ent a letter to the hou&s;e, de|&s;iring they would order the regiments that were in London to quit that city, and make way for his troops, as he could not think it proper for tho&s;e men who had been &s;o lately in rebellion, to re&s;ide in the &s;ame place with his &s;oldiers, who were devoted to the &s;ervice of the parliament: at the &s;ame time he forwarded a plan for the di&s;po&s;ition of his own troops in London, and a&s;&s;igned quarters in the
<PB N="397" REF="3990">
neighbourhood for tho&s;e which &s;hould march out at his approach. This de|mand increa&s;ed the &s;u&s;picion of the hou&s;e; but they were fain to comply with<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> his directions. On the third day of February he entered London in triumph; at the head of his army, and repaired to the council of &s;tate, where the oath of abjuration being tendered to him, he de&s;ired time to con&s;ider; ob&s;erving that &s;trong objections had been made to it in parliament. They refu&s;ed to admit him as a member on any other terms, and he withdrew. On the &s;ixth, he was in|troduced into the hou&s;e of commons by Scot and Robin&s;on, a chair of velvet being placed within the bar; the &s;peaker &s;olemnly thanked him, in the name of the parliament, for his great &s;ervices, and de&s;ired him to be &s;eated. He declined the compliment; and, &s;tanding behind the chair, made a &s;hort harrangue. He &s;aid, the peaceable re&s;toration of the parliament was not one of the &s;malle&s;t ble&s;&s;ings which God had conferred upon this poor nation. He expre&s;&s;ed his joy that God had been plea&s;ed to make him, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an in&s;trument to bring about that ble&s;&s;ed event. He acknowledged his own unworthine&s;s and their genero&s;ity. He told them, that he had received a great number of ad|dre&s;&s;es, expre&s;&s;ing the de&s;ire of a free parliament: that the excluded members &s;hould be re&s;tored without the impo&s;ition of oaths; and the time fixed for an|other general election. He ob&s;erved, that the fewer oaths they impo&s;ed, they would the &s;ooner bring their work to perfection. He exhorted them to be upon their guard again&s;t cavaliers and fanatics. He recommended the &s;ettle|ment of Ireland and Scotland to their particular care; and, with re&s;pect to this la&s;t kingdom, pre&s;ented them with a li&s;t of judges and commi&s;&s;ioners of ap|proved talents and fidelity.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="37" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The common-council of London, &s;uppo&s;ing them&s;elves per|fectly well acquainted with the real de&s;ign of Monk, re&s;olved to pay no taxes, until the excluded members &s;hould be replaced. The parliament forthwith ordered the general to march into the city, arre&s;t eleven members of the common-council, carry off their chains, and demoli&s;h their gates and port|cullices. Monk, in obedience to this order, entered the city with his troops, apprehended the eleven common-council-men, and began to de&s;troy the gates. Then he wrote a letter to the parliament, informing them of what he had done, and begging they would moderate the &s;everity of their order. The hou&s;e, whether from re&s;entment to the city, or with a view to prove the &s;in|cerity of his profe&s;&s;ions, commanded him to execute punctually the order he had received; and he forthwith obeyed their mandate. After having deprived the city of its chains, gates, and portcullices, he marched back to Whitehall, of his own accord, leaving the Londoners equally a&s;toni&s;hed and incen&s;ed at his proceedings. On that very day, Prai&s;egod Barebones pre&s;ented to parlia|ment a petition, &s;igned by a great number of per&s;ons, de&s;iring that every in|dividual of the kingdom &s;hould be compelled to take the oath of abjuration. He met with a gracious reception, and was thanked for his affection to the commonwealth.</P>

<P>Monk began to think he had extended his di&s;&s;imulation too far. He &s;ent his brother Clarges to a&s;&s;ure the mayor, that he would make ample reparation for what he had done, and to propo&s;e a conference with him and the common-council. The mayor, afraid of being en&s;nared by his deceit, re|jected the propo&s;al; neverthele&s;s he re&s;olved to vi&s;it the city once more, at the
<PB N="398" REF="4000">
head of his troops. Ju&s;t as he began his march, he, with the concurrence of his officers, &s;ent a letter to the parliament, complaining that they had em|ployed him in the mo&s;t unpopular &s;ervice they could devi&s;e; that they payed too much regard to Lambert, Vane, and &s;ome other friends to the com|mittee of &s;afety; that they allowed Ludlow to &s;it in parliament, although he &s;tood accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on by the officers in Ireland; and that they had thanked Barebones for having pre&s;ented a &s;editious petition. He then po&s;i|tively demanded that, by Friday next, they would i&s;&s;ue writs for filling the vacant places, and make way for the meeting of a free parliament. The hou&s;e could no longer doubt of his de&s;ign; yet they voted that he &s;hould be thanked for his care and concern; and that they &s;hould begin without delay to take mea&s;ures for his &s;atisfaction. Scot and Robin&s;on were &s;ent to make him acquainted with this re&s;olution; but he had already marched into the city, and prevailed with the mayor to a&s;&s;emble the common-council. He told the&s;e two deputies, that every thing would be well, provided they would ob&s;erve the contents of his letter. When this an&s;wer was reported to the hou&s;e, they voted that the command of the army &s;hould be ve&s;ted in five commi&s;&s;ioners; and they nominated Monk as one of them, though in &s;uch a manner, that his pre&s;ence was not nece&s;&s;ary to a quorum. Mean while he had effectually ex|cu&s;ed him&s;elf to the magi&s;trates of London, by declaring his inviolable regard for the city, and communicating the letter he had &s;ent to the parliament. No|thing was now heard but ringing of bells and &s;houts of joy: the populace made bonfires in every &s;treet, and roa&s;ted rumps of poultry in deri&s;ion of the par|liament.</P>

<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>When Monk was &s;ummoned to take his place in the council of &s;tate, he declined going thither, on pretence that his pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary in the city, to keep the inhabitants quiet. He now again received petitions from all quarters, for the re&s;toration of the &s;ecluded members; and, after &s;ome fruitle&s;s conferences between &s;ome of the&s;e and the &s;itting members, he re&s;olved to re-e&s;tabli&s;h them by force of arms. Having &s;ecured the con&s;ent of his officers, and exacted a new promi&s;e from the excluded members, that they would call a full and free parliament, he, on the twenty-fir&s;t day of Fe|bruary, accompanied them to Whitehall; from whence they were conducted, with a &s;ufficient guard, to the parliament-hou&s;e, which they entered, without having &s;ent any previous intimation of their purpo&s;e. Their number was &s;o &s;uperior to that of the rump, that the chiefs of this la&s;t party, &s;eeing no po&s;|&s;ibility of making head again&s;t &s;uch oppo&s;ition, thought proper to withdraw, and leave the field free to their antagoni&s;ts. Monk &s;ent circular letters to the commanders of all the regiments, informing them of this revolution: he a&s;|&s;ured them, that the re&s;tored members were zealous for the intere&s;t of the army; and de&s;ired them to exert all their vigilance in defeating the de&s;igns which the malignants might hatch in favour of Charles Stuart. He concealed from them his real de&s;ign, becau&s;e they were generally anabapti&s;ts and republicans, not yet &s;ufficiently prepared for the re&s;toration of the royal family.</P>

<P>The parliament annulled all the re&s;olutions and ordinances which had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the excluded members: they relea&s;ed Sir George Booth, and all the royali&s;ts, who were in pri&s;on; they appointed Monk general in chief of all the forces in the three kingdoms; they repealed the oath of abjuration,
<PB N="399" REF="4010">
and that of fidelity to the e&s;tabli&s;hed government without king and hou&s;e of peers; &s;o that the lords were re&s;tored to their right of &s;itting in parliament. They made great alterations in the militia all over the kingdom: con&s;tituted<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon. Baker. Whitelock.</NOTE> a council of &s;tate, compo&s;ed of one and twenty members, the majority of whom were royali&s;ts; and di&s;&s;olved their own a&s;&s;embly on the &s;eventeenth day of March, after having i&s;&s;ued writs for a free parliament, to meet on the twenty-fifth day of April. But, before their &s;eparation, they voted that no per&s;on &s;hould be employed in a military capacity, until after he &s;hould have acknowledged upon oath the ju&s;tice of the war, which the parlia|ment had waged again&s;t the late king; and that none of tho&s;e who had carried arms for Charles &s;hould be returned as members of the en&s;uing par|liament.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XLI.</HEAD>
<P>The republicans &s;eeing through this di&s;gui&s;e, endeavoured to per|&s;uade Monk to a&s;&s;ume the &s;overeign power, in imitation of Cromwell, chu&s;ing to &s;ubmit to a &s;ingle chief, rather than expo&s;e them&s;elves to the vengeance of injured maje&s;ty; but he rejected all their remon&s;trances on this &s;ubject. Then they in&s;tigated a good number of officers, who profe&s;&s;ed their own principles, to draw up a declaration, in which they engaged to maintain the republican government. This was pre&s;ented to the general, with a de&s;ire that it might be &s;ub&s;cribed by the whole army. But he fir&s;t excu&s;ed him&s;elf, alledging that it was unnece&s;&s;ary; and, when they repeated their importunities, he, in an ab|&s;olute tone, forbade them to a&s;&s;emble for the future, without his permi&s;&s;ion. Cardinal Mazarine having received intimation that Monk had formed &s;ome great de&s;ign, ordered Bordeaux, the French amba&s;&s;ador, to make a tender of his &s;ervices to the general, who civilly declined his offers. Immediately after the di&s;&s;olution of the parliament, Sir John Greenvill, &s;ent over by the king, had a private audience of Monk, who di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him to his ma&s;ter, with a&s;|&s;urances of zeal and fidelity to his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, as well as with &s;ome &s;a|lutary advice, which Charles followed with great punctuality. Mean while the general new-modelled his army. Some officers, by his direction, pre&s;ented him with an addre&s;s, in which they promi&s;ed to obey implicitly the orders of the en&s;uing parliament. He approved of this engagement, which he or|dered to be &s;igned by all the different regiments; and this furni&s;hed him with a pretence for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing all the officers by whom it was rejected.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="42" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XLII.</HEAD>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e tran&s;actions, his endeavours had well nigh been defeated by an accident: Lambert e&s;caped from the Tower, and began to a&s;&s;emble forces. He was a very active officer, and had acquired great in|fluence in the army. Monk knew that a great number of the &s;oldiers were republicans, and would take the fir&s;t opportunity of oppo&s;ing his mea&s;ures in favour of the king. He therefore di&s;patched colonel Ingold&s;by, with his own regiment, again&s;t Lambert, before he &s;hould have time to a&s;&s;emble his dependents. That officer had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Daventry, with four troops of hor&s;e; but the greater part of them joined Ingold&s;by, to whom he him&s;elf &s;urrendered, not without exhibiting marks of pu&s;illanimity, that ill agreed with his reputation. Okey, Axtel, Cobbet, and Crede, were likewi&s;e taken without oppo&s;ition. The republicans made another effort before the meeting<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1660.</NOTE> of the parliament: they circulated copies of a feigned letter, dated at Bru&s;&s;els, importing that the king de&s;ired his re&s;toration for nothing &s;o much as an op|portunity
<PB N="400" REF="4020">
of being revenged upon his enemies. In oppo&s;ition to this &s;trata|gem, which began to produce &s;ome effect, the nobility and other royali&s;ts, to the number of &s;eventy, &s;igned a declaration di&s;avowing &s;uch principles, and prote&s;ting their de&s;ire of living peaceably, without &s;eeking revenge again&s;t the authors of their misfortunes.</P>

<DIV4 N="43" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>On the twenty-fifth day of April, the new parliament met in two hou&s;es, according to the antient con&s;titution; and in both the intere&s;t of the royali&s;ts predominated, notwith&s;tanding the votes of limitation, to which the electors payed no regard. On the &s;econd day of their &s;itting, Sir John Green|vill returned from Bru&s;&s;els, with the king's commi&s;&s;ion, con&s;tituting Monk general of all the forces; and a letter from his maje&s;ty, to be communicated to the council of &s;tate and the officers of the army: but the general excu&s;ed him&s;elf from opening this letter, without the permi&s;&s;ion of parliament. The hou&s;e of commons being adjourned for a few days, Sir John Greenvill pre&s;ented to the lords a letter from the king, expre&s;&s;ing his hope that, as they were now re&s;tored to their privileges, they would u&s;e their endeavours to ap|pea&s;e the troubles of the kingdom, re-e&s;tabli&s;h his maje&s;ty in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ju&s;t prerogatives, re&s;tore to the parliament its privileges, and to the people their liberties. Together with this letter, Greenvill delivered a declaration, in which the king promi&s;ed to govern according to the laws of the realm, and maintain the rights of his &s;ubjects: To pa&s;s an act of indemnity, in favour of all tho&s;e who had acted again&s;t him or his father, except &s;uch as the parlia|ment &s;hould deem unworthy of pardon: To indulge tender and &s;crupulous con&s;ciences with liberty in matters of religion: To leave to the examination of parliament the claims of tho&s;e officers, &s;oldiers, and others, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed lands to which their titles might be conte&s;ted: To confirm all the&s;e articles by act of parliament: To &s;atisfy the army under general Monk, with re|&s;pect to their arrears; and receive the officers and &s;oldiers into his &s;ervice, in the &s;ame rank and with the &s;ame appointments, which they then en|joyed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="44" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>This declaration was no &s;ooner read, than the lords voted that, according to the antient con&s;titution of England, the government ought to be ve&s;ted in a king, lords, and commons. The &s;ame declaration, with another letter, being delivered to the lower hou&s;e after their adjournment, they con|curred with the vote of the lords; and re&s;olved to pre&s;ent the king with fifty thou&s;and pounds, the duke of York with ten thou&s;and, and the duke of Glouce&s;ter with half that &s;um. Then the two hou&s;es erazed from their re|cords all the acts which had pa&s;&s;ed to the prejudice of royalty. The army, the navy, and the city of London, prepared addre&s;&s;es, congratulating his ma|je&s;ty on his re&s;toration, and vowing inviolable fidelity; and the&s;e were deli|vered to Charles by the hands of Clarges. On the eighth day of May, the king was proclaimed in London; and the deputies of the parliament and city &s;et out on the eleventh for the Hague, where Charles waited their arrival. Some pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters repaired to the &s;ame place, to te&s;tify the zeal of that &s;ect for his re&s;toration, and &s;ound his real &s;entiments with re&s;pect to re|ligion. He confirmed to them, by word of mouth, the promi&s;e of liberty of con&s;cience, in&s;erted in his declaration; but when they exhorted him to aboli&s;h the u&s;e of the common-prayer and the &s;urplice in his own chapel, he frankly
<PB N="401" REF="4030">
told them, that as he did not intend to re&s;trict any per&s;on in point of religion, &s;o neither would he be re&s;tricted. He gave audience to the deputies of the parliament on the &s;ixteenth day of May; and, at the &s;ame time, admiral Montague payed his re&s;pects to his maje&s;ty, accompanied by the principal of|ficers of the fleet, who waited his orders at Scheveling: he afterwards re|ceived the compliments of congratulation from the &s;tates-general, and em|barked on the twenty-third day of the month. On the twenty-&s;ixth he ar|rived at Dover, where he was met by general Monk, whom he embraced with the warme&s;t affection, honouring him with the appellation of Father. He<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon. Whitelock. Baker.</NOTE> proceeded directly to Canterbury, where he be&s;towed the order of the garter upon his re&s;torer; and, on the twenty-ninth, which was his birth-day, reached Whitehall, through an innumerable multitude of people, who rent the air with &s;houts and acclamations. They had been &s;o long di&s;tracted by unrelent|ing factions, oppre&s;&s;ed and alarmed by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tyrannies which threa|tened national anarchy and de&s;truction, that they could not, without extrava|gant emotions of joy, behold their con&s;titution re&s;tored without blood&s;hed; while the king remounted the throne of his ance&s;tors, and law, order, and &s;ubordination, began to flow quietly in their antient channels.</P>

<P>CHARLES II. was in the thirtieth year of his age when he took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne with tho&s;e advantages. He had taken pains in cultivating his under&s;tanding. He under&s;tood mechanics and &s;hip-building; was well acquainted with the hi&s;tory and politics of the mo&s;t remarkable &s;tates in Europe: he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a natural fund of humour and vivacity, together with the mo&s;t in&s;inuating addre&s;s, and the power of plea&s;ing in conver&s;ation. He was a latitudinarian in religion, carele&s;s, indolent, and ex$$$mely addicted to plea&s;ure. The people, partly in imitation of the king's jovial di&s;po&s;ition, and partly from the nature of the human mind, &s;o apt to be hurried from one ex|treme to another, gave a loo&s;e to intemperance, and the whole kingdom was filled with riot and exce&s;s. The fir&s;t object that ingro&s;&s;ed the attention of Charles after his re&s;toration, was the choice of his council, in$o which (though it chiefly con&s;i&s;ted of zealous royali&s;ts) he, from political views, admitted &s;ome chiefs of the pre&s;byterian party, &s;uch as the earl of Manche&s;ter, appointed lord chamberlain; lord Say, privy &s;eal; Anne&s;ley, created earl of Anglefey; A&s;hley Cooper, and Denzil Hollis, preferred to the dignity of barons. The dukedom of Albemarle was conferred upon Monk; and admiral Montague was created earl of Sandwich. The king &s;hifted the burthen of affairs in a good mea&s;ure from his own &s;houlders on tho&s;e of his brother the duke of York, who excelled Charles in application, as much as he fell &s;hort of him in capacity. He was proud, vindictive, arbitrary, and bigotted to the Roman catholic religion, which he had embraced in his exile. The king him&s;elf is &s;aid to have been a convert to that per&s;ua&s;ion; though this was a circum&s;tance he carefully concealed; and indeed he &s;eemed to laugh at all forms of religion. His fir&s;t mini&s;ter was Sir Edward Hyde, lately created earl of Cla$endon, and high chan|cellor of England, who had adhered to him in all his fortunes, was an upright and excellent judge; and &s;erved him with equal integrity and attachment. He under&s;tood the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the different parties, which he managed with di&s;cretion, though he &s;eems to have been rather too inflexible with regard
<PB N="404" REF="4060">
to the pre&s;byterians. His daughter Anne admitted the duke of York to the privilege of a husband, on promi&s;e of marriage; and, her pregnancy being the con&s;equence of their &s;ecret corre&s;pondence, Charles in&s;i&s;ted upon his performing his promi&s;e, rather than fix a &s;tain upon the family of &s;uch a faithful &s;ervant. He accordingly e&s;pou&s;ed her, though not without reluctance; and this mar|riage was extremely di&s;agreeable to the queen mother, who had been always aver&s;e to the chancellor. The marquis of Ormond was now created duke, and appointed lord &s;teward of the hou&s;hold; the earl of Southampton, high trea|&s;urer; and Sir Edward Nicholas, &s;ecretary of &s;tate.</P>

<P>The a&s;&s;embly of lords and commons was now called "The convention," until the king, on the third day after his arrival, went to the upper hou&s;e; and, &s;ending for the commons, pa&s;&s;ed an act, by which it was declared a parliament. Then they proceeded on the bill of indemnity, which met with &s;ome ob&s;tacles in the lower hou&s;e, on account of the clau&s;es to be in&s;erted. Some members propo&s;ed to make examples of all tho&s;e who had remarkably exerted them&s;elves in favour of the late u&s;urpation, without paying any regard to the king's decla|ration from Breda. Many per&s;ons imagined that this propo&s;al was dictated by Charles him&s;elf, actuated by the de&s;ire of revenge; and divers libels were privately circulated, in order to in&s;pire the public with a di&s;tru&s;t of his &s;incerity. With a view to di&s;&s;ipate the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, the king &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the parlia|ment, pre&s;&s;ing them to di&s;patch the act of indemnity, conformable to his decla|ration from Breda: and, in a few days, it was &s;ent to the lords for their con|currence. The commons had excepted from the benefit of this pardon a very few of the mo&s;t notorious regicides; but the peers, having received a number of petitions from the widows and orphans of tho&s;e who had been executed by &s;entences of high-courts erected during the u&s;urpation, in&s;i&s;ted upon excepting all who had &s;at as judges on &s;uch trials. Charles, fearing that this difference between the hou&s;es might be productive of delay, repaired to the hou&s;e of lords, and per&s;uaded them to pa&s;s the bill, in a pathetic &s;peech; repre&s;enting that his honour was concerned; that he intended to except none but the immediate murtherers of his father; and that the tranquillity of the kingdom depended upon the performance of his promi&s;e. The lords, thus &s;ollicited, concurred with the commons in the material articles of the bill; but they would not con|&s;ent to a clau&s;e relating to nineteen of tho&s;e who &s;at as judges on the late king. They had &s;urrendered them&s;elves in con&s;equence of a proclamation, in which Charles declared, that none but &s;uch as &s;hould &s;urrender them&s;elves within a certain time, could be entitled to his maje&s;ty's mercy. The commons had in|&s;erted a clau&s;e to deprive them of every thing but their lives; and the lords in&s;i&s;ted upon their enjoying the full benefit of the indemnity, as they had ma|nife&s;ted &s;uch confidence in the king's clemency. After &s;everal conferences the two hou&s;es agreed, that in ca&s;e tho&s;e nineteen &s;hould be condemned by the judges, the king &s;hould re&s;pite them until the plea&s;ure of his maje&s;ty and the parliament &s;hould be more particularly known. At length the act pa&s;&s;ed, excepting nine and forty who had &s;at in judgment upon their &s;overeign.</P>

<P>Oliver Cromwell, Brad&s;haw, Pride, and one and twenty other members of that court, already dead, were confi&s;cated, and &s;ubjected to &s;uch other pe|nalties as the king and parliament &s;hould think proper to inflict. Philips and Ha&s;$erig underwent the &s;ame fate: Hutchin&s;on and La&s;&s;els were con|demned
<PB N="405" REF="4070">
in a fine, and declared incapable of exerci&s;ing any employment. Oliver St. John, and &s;eventeen other per&s;ons nominated in the act, were forbid to ac|cept any civil, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, or military office, on pain of being deemed excepted from the benefit of the indemnity. All who had pronounced &s;entence of death as judges during the u&s;urpation were declared incapable of being elected mem|bers of parliament, or of exerci&s;ing any employment, excepting Ingold&s;by and Tomlin&s;on. The fir&s;t had been very in&s;trumental in effecting the re&s;toration; the other had been recommended to the favour of Charles in a me&s;&s;age from his father, who had been treated with great humanity by Tomlin&s;on; and even made a convert of that officer, by whom he was attended on the &s;caffold. Sir Henry Vane and general Lambert were likewi&s;e excepted from the act, though they had not been concerned in the king's murder.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>When Charles gave his a&s;&s;ent to this act, he pa&s;&s;ed another, confirming all the judiciary proceedings &s;ince the beginning of the civil war, notwith&s;tand|ing their illegality; a third for levying a capitation tax to pay the fleet and army; a fourth, fixing the intere&s;t of money at &s;ix per cent; and a fifth, or|daining that the anniver&s;ary of his re&s;toration &s;hould be ob&s;erved as a perpetual holiday. Charles took this opportunity to cajole the parliament with a flat|tering &s;peech, in which he hinted his own nece&s;&s;ities. The commons pre&s;ented his two brothers with a &s;um of money; and re&s;olved to &s;ettle the king's yearly revenue at the rate of twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds: but, before they could &s;ettle the funds, he ordered them to adjourn to the &s;ixth day of November, after having pa&s;&s;ed an act for rai&s;ing by a land tax, within the &s;pace of one month, the &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and pounds, to an&s;wer the pre&s;ent occa|&s;ions of his maje&s;ty. They likewi&s;e continued for &s;ome time longer the tax of &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds per month, which they had impo&s;ed in the begin|ning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. At this juncture the duke of Glouce&s;ter died of the &s;mall|pox, in the twentieth year of his age: he was a prince of an amiable character, and tenderly beloved by the king, who &s;eemed more afflicted by his death than by any other incident of his whole life.</P>

<P>During the adjournment of parliament, Charles appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to proceed upon the trials of the regicides; the number of whom, including the officers of the court, and others immediatley concerned in that tragedy, amounted originally to four&s;core. Of the&s;e, five and twenty were dead; nine and twenty had e&s;caped from the kingdom; &s;even were deemed proper objects of the king's mercy; nine and twenty received &s;entence of death; but nineteen were reprieved during the king's plea&s;ure, becau&s;e they had &s;urrendered them|&s;elves according to the proclamation. The ten, devoted to immediate ex|ecution, were Harri&s;on, Carew, Coke, Peters, Scot, Clement, Scrope, Jones, Hacker, and Axtel. The&s;e were all enthu&s;ia&s;ts, either millenarians or repub|licans; and bore their fate, not &s;imply with fortitude, but with the &s;pirit and con|fidence of martyrs, who &s;uffered for having done their duty. Some circum&s;tances of &s;candalous barbarity attended their execution. Harri&s;on's entrails were torn out, and thrown into the fire before he had expired: his head was fixed on the &s;ledge that drew Coke and Peters to the place of execution, with the face turned towards them. The executioner, having mangled Coke, approached Peters, be&s;meared with the blood of his friend, and a&s;ked, how he liked that work? Peters eyed him with di&s;dain, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;You have butchered a &s;ervant of God in my &s;ight; but I defy your cruelty.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>After the parliament adjourned, the king had publi&s;hed a proclamation on the &s;ubject of religion, directing the bi&s;hops how to exerci&s;e their &s;piritual juri&s;diction; ordaining that a certain number of theologi&s;ts &s;hould be cho&s;en to review and alter the liturgy; and that no per&s;on &s;hould, in the mean time, be obliged to conform. Nine of the old bi&s;hops, &s;till living, were re&s;tored to their dioce&s;es. Bi&s;hoprics and benefices were offered to the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters; but they were refu&s;ed by all except Reynolds, who be|came bi&s;hop of Norwich. In the month of October, the prince&s;s dowager of Orange arrived in London; and the king was afterwards vi&s;ited by his mother, accompanied by the prince&s;s Henrietta, and Edward prince palatine, brother to prince Rupert. It was at this juncture, that the queen-mother pro|po&s;ed the match between her daughter Henrietta and the duke of Orleans; to which Charles con&s;ented without he&s;itation.</P>

<P>The parliament, meeting on the &s;ixth day of November, &s;ent a &s;olemn deputation to congratulate the queen upon her happy return; and the commons pre&s;ented ten thou&s;and pounds to each of her daughters: then they took mea|&s;ures for enabling the king to di&s;band the army, which was gradually reduced; Charles re&s;erving only a regiment of hor&s;e, and another of infantry, as a guard to his per&s;on. In &s;ettling the king's revenue, the commons aboli&s;hed the court of wards and liveries, in lieu of which he received one hundred thou&s;and pounds a year, ari&s;ing from one half of the exci&s;e, e&s;tabli&s;hed as a fund in per|petuity for that purpo&s;e; and the other half of the exci&s;e, together with the duty of tonnage and poundage, were granted to the king for his life. This affair being di&s;patched, the parliament ordered the bodies of Cromwell, Ireton, Brad&s;haw, and Pride, to be dug out of their graves, and dragged through the &s;treets to Tyburn, where they continued hanging a whole day, and then were interred under the gallows. On a vague report of a con&s;piracy again&s;t the life of the king and queen-mother, Desborough, Overton, Morgan, and &s;ome other officers were taken into cu&s;tody; but, upon inquiry, the report was found to be without foundation. On the twenty-ninth day of December, the king, going to the hou&s;e of peers, thanked the two hou&s;es for their affection, in the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude: the chancellor expatiated on the &s;ame &s;ubject, and then his maje&s;ty di&s;&s;olved the parliament. The earl of Clarendon, in his &s;peech, touched upon the militia; &s;aying, he wi&s;hed they had found time to &s;ettle it to the mutual &s;atisfaction of king and people: he likewi&s;e mentioned a con&s;piracy for &s;urpri&s;ing Wind&s;or, Whitehall, and the Tower of London. He affirmed, that many disbanded officers and republicans were concerned in this de&s;ign; and that they had planned an in&s;urrection in the We&s;t, to be headed by general Ludlow.</P>

<P>In the beginning of January, while the king accompanied his mother to Dover, one Venner, a de&s;perate enthu&s;ia&s;t, and fifth monarchy-man, appeared in the &s;treets of London at the head of three&s;core fanatics completely armed, and proclaimed king Je&s;us. They flew a man becau&s;e he declared him&s;elf for<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kennet. Barnet. L$dlow. $word$.</NOTE> God and king Charles. They believed them&s;elves invulnerable, made a de&s;pe|rate re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t a body of the trained-bands &s;ent to di&s;per&s;e them, and retreated to Kane-wood near Hamp&s;tead. Being di&s;lodged from thence in the morning by a detachment of &s;oldiers, they returned to London, and took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hou&s;e, in which they defended them&s;elves again&s;t a body of troops,
<PB N="407" REF="4090">
until the majority was killed. The few &s;urvivors were taken, tried, condemned, and executed; and affirmed to the la&s;t, that, if they had been deceived, the Lord him&s;elf was their deceiver. The king u&s;ed great expedition in di&s;&s;olving the convention-parliament, becau&s;e a great number of presbyterians had been returned among the commons, and they were a check on the conde&s;cending temper of the other members. They had granted the &s;upplies &s;cantily, and with the appearance of di&s;tru&s;t; they were aver&s;e to the king's being ve&s;ted with the whole power of the militia; nor would they have tamely &s;uffered the bi&s;hops to re&s;ume their &s;eats in parliament. This mad attempt was looked upon as a confirmation of the con&s;piracy; and it furni&s;hed the mini&s;try with a handle to publi&s;h a proclamation again&s;t all religious conventicles, ordaining that the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy &s;hould be exacted from all per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of di&s;affection to the government: &s;o that the presbyterians were con|founded with the enemies of the &s;tate, under the general appellation of Di&s;&s;enters.</P>

<P>The king had not been long re&s;tored when he converted his attention to the affairs of Scotland. Some members of the council propo&s;ed, that the Scots &s;hould be retained in &s;ubjection by means of a &s;tanding army and the $orts which had been erected from one end of the kingdom to the other. The earl of Lauderdale, who had been taken at the battle of Worce&s;ter, and con|tinued a pri&s;oner from that event to the re&s;toration, was now admitted to the council, and &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed this propo&s;ition. He ob&s;erved that the Scots had been reduced to &s;lavery, in con&s;equence of the efforts they made in behalf of his maje&s;ty; and though they were not mentioned in the declaration from Breda, the king could not, without incurring the imputation of ingratitude, allow them to remain in a &s;tate of mi&s;ery and oppre&s;&s;ion. He &s;aid they were &s;o humbled, that they would comply with any terms of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the crown, provided their independency &s;hould be re&s;tored: that the attachment of the Scots to their native prince was very warm, and would be a good re&s;ource again&s;t the turbulent &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h. Charles was &s;atisfied with the&s;e ar|guments. He ordered the troops in Scotland to be di&s;banded, the forts to be erazed, the Engli&s;h judges in that country to di&s;continue their functions, and a convention of the e&s;tates to be a&s;&s;embled. Tho&s;e who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves for their loyalty, were nominated to the great offices of the &s;tate. He appointed the earl of Glencairn, chancellor; the earl of Crawford, trea&s;urer; the earl of Ca&s;tils, lord ju&s;tice general; the earl of Lauderdale, &s;ecretary of &s;tate; and Middleton, now created an earl, was &s;ent down to repre&s;ent his maje&s;ty in the office of lord high commi&s;&s;ioner. At the &s;ame time the council determined to intimidate that nation by &s;ome examples of &s;everity. The mar|quis of Argyle had made a journey to London, in hope of being admitted to pay his re&s;pects to the king in per&s;on: but he was arre&s;ted $word$ Whitehall, com|mitted to the Tower, and afterwards &s;ent down to Scotland to be tried for high trea&s;on. The other victim devoted to death, was one Guthry, a $our pedan|tic presbyterian mini&s;ter, who had taken indecent freedoms with the king, while he re&s;ided among that people <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The king appointed the earls of O$$ery and Montrath, in conjunction with Sir Mau$ice E$|&s;tace, chancellor of Ireland, to govern that king|dom as ju&s;tices, until he &s;hould have lei&s;ure to name a lord-lieutenant.</P>

<P>Some pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters finding them&s;elves confounded with other &s;ectaries whom they abhorred, intreated the king to give order for a conference between them and the bi&s;hops, that both &s;ides might candidly examine their objections to the Engli&s;h liturgy. Charles complied with their reque&s;t: one and twenty eccle&s;ia&s;tics were nominated on each &s;ide; and the conferences were begun in the hou&s;e of the bi&s;hop of London, who lived in the Savoy. The bi&s;hops would not offer &s;uch an indignity to the church as to make the lea&s;t conce&s;&s;ion to this &s;tubborn &s;ect; and the presbyterians exclaimed again&s;t the liturgy, and the &s;urplice, as relics of the church of Rome. After ob&s;tinate di&s;pute and virulent altercation, they parted more than ever irritated again&s;t each other.

<P>Writs had been i&s;&s;ued for a new parliament to meet on the eighth day of May; and the court had influenced the elections &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that the majority of the members returned were &s;trongly attached to the hierarchy and the royal prerogative. The king, in his fir&s;t &s;peech to both hou&s;es, recom|mended two bills for confirming the act of indemnity, and made them ac|quainted with his intention to e&s;pou&s;e the infanta of Portugal; a match al|ready concluded, with the advice of his council. Sir Edward Turner, &s;ollici|tor-general to the duke of York, being cho&s;en &s;peaker, the two hou&s;es voted that thanks &s;hould be returned to his maje&s;ty, for this in&s;tance of his confi|dence, in communicating his purpo&s;ed marriage to his parliament; and that they &s;hould go in a body and congratulate him upon that event.

<P>The republicans thinking them&s;elves in&s;ecure from the zeal of this parliament, petitioned the king that the act of indemnity might be confirmed; and he wrote to the two hou&s;es for this purpo&s;e, giving them to under&s;tand, that this &s;hould be the fir&s;t bill he would pa&s;s. They forthwith complied with his de&s;ire; and, on the tenth day of June, he gave his a&s;&s;ent to an act to con|firm the act of indemnity pa&s;&s;ed in the preceding parliament; and to another, authori&s;ing the king to receive a free and voluntary contribution from his &s;ub|jects. The next bu&s;ine&s;s on which the commons proceeded, was a bill for confi&s;cating the e&s;tates of the regicides who were dead; and for the puni&s;h|ment of lord Mon&s;on, Henry Mildmay, and Robert Wallop, who, though the king &s;pared their lives, were re&s;erved for other pains and penalties. In con&s;equence of this act, they were dragged on a hurdle to Tyburn, with ropes about their necks, and then doomed to perpetual impri&s;onment. This com|plai&s;ant parliament, in an act for the pre&s;ervation of his maje&s;ty's per&s;on and government, extended the penalties of high trea&s;on to all who &s;hould devi&s;e the death of the king, or any injury to his per&s;on; who &s;hould plot to arre&s;t,

impri&s;on, depo&s;e, or wage war again&s;t him; who &s;hould in&s;tigate any foreign power to invade his dominions, or manife&s;t this evil intention by word or writing. They decreed, that whoever &s;hould affirm the king was a papi&s;t or heretic, or excite the hatred of the people again&s;t his government or per|&s;on, &s;hould be rendered incapable of exerci&s;ing any employment in church or &s;tate. They annulled the act for excluding bi&s;hops from the hou&s;e of lords; they declared that the power of the militia belonged to the king alone; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rapin. Ralph.</NOTE> they empowered him to di&s;po&s;e of the land forces. He thanked them for the&s;e marks of their confidence and affection; and, having pa&s;&s;ed the bills, ordered them to adjourn till the twentieth day of November. The convocation which &s;at during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, did nothing of any con&s;equence, but grant a benevo|lence to his maje&s;ty, according to the act pa&s;&s;ed for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>In Scotland the tide of loyalty ran with extraordinary violence. The parliament of that kingdom carried their complai&s;ance to &s;uch extrava|gance, as to annul by a reci&s;&s;ory act all the laws that had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the be|ginning of their di&s;putes with the late king; &s;o that epi&s;copacy was of cour&s;e re&s;tored. They declared the covenant unlawful, and voted an additional re|venue to the king, of forty thou&s;and pounds, to be levied by the way of exci&s;e, for the maintenance of a &s;mall force, which might prevent future di&s;|turbances. The marquis of Argyle was tried for his compliance with the late u&s;urpation; and made &s;uch a vigorous defence, that the parliament, though bent upon his de&s;truction, mu&s;t have acquitted him of the charge, had not the commi&s;&s;ioner produced letters which he had written to Monk, while he commanded in Scotland, expre&s;&s;ing his hearty concurrence with the go|vernment at that time e&s;tabli&s;hed. Being thus ba&s;ely betrayed by his former friend, he was found guilty, and condemned to lo&s;e his head, which was or|dered to be fixed upon the place from whence the head of Montro&s;e had been lately taken down, and &s;olemnly interred with the other parts of his body. The marquis behaved at his execution with great compo&s;ure; declared him&s;elf innocent of the late king's death; exhorted the people to adhere to the cove|nant, which he called the work of God, and died in peace with all mankind. Guthry confe&s;&s;ed all that was laid to his charge, and &s;eemed to glory in his &s;ufferings. On the ladder, he made a kind of &s;ermon to the people, in which he ju&s;tified all he had done, and extolled the covenant as the mo&s;t meritorious obligation. Sir Archibald John&s;ton of Warri&s;ton, who had been one of Cromwell's lords, was now attainted; but e&s;caped into France, where he was afterwards &s;eized, brought over, and executed. Sharp, who had been agent for the Scotti&s;h pre&s;byterians, now de&s;erted his party, and being con&s;ecrated by the bi&s;hop of London, was created archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's. Hamilton, Fairfoul, and Leighton, received the &s;ame con&s;ecration, and were appointed to different &s;ees in Scotland. They obtained from the king a declaration re|e&s;tabli&s;hing epi&s;copacy in that kingdom. The council &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all &s;ynods and pre&s;byteries, but &s;uch as &s;hould be authorized by the bi&s;hops. The parliament confirmed this re&s;toration; prohibited all &s;orts of conven|ticles; re-e&s;tabli&s;hed the right of patronage; and ordained that all per&s;ons in public employments &s;hould not only renounce the two covenants, but al&s;o declare in writing, that it was unlawful for &s;ubjects, on any pretence

<P>In England the cavaliers loudly complained of the king's ingrati|tude, in neglecting and leaving them to &s;tarve, while their per&s;ecutors, by the a$t of indemnity, enjoyed the immen&s;e wealth they had acquired by the mo&s;t unlawful methods. The mini&s;try, on the other hand, filled the city with ru|mours of plots and con&s;piracies again&s;t the king and the government. Their aim was partly to amu&s;e the public, and partly to animate the people and par|liament again&s;t the nonconformi&s;ts, who were &s;aid to be the authors of all tho&s;e combinations. The king him&s;elf, the members of both hou&s;es, and e&s;pecially the earl of Clarendon, hated the pre&s;byterians, and wanted an op|portunity to humble them, under the general term of Nonconformi&s;ts. The parliament meeting in November, petitioned the king to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation, commanding all reduced officers and &s;oldiers to retire to the di&s;tance of twenty miles from London: then the commons voted twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds for his maje&s;ty's pre&s;ent occa&s;ions.</P>

<P>The earl of Clarendon, in a conference between the two hou&s;es, po|&s;itively affirmed that a con&s;piracy had been formed &s;ince the month of March, to interrupt the peace of the nation. He named &s;everal per&s;ons concerned in this plot, the particular circum&s;tances of which he explained; and &s;aid, that although it had been defeated at London, by the precaution taken with regard to the di&s;banded officers and &s;oldiers, it would, neverthele&s;s, be pro&s;ecuted in different counties of England. The two hou&s;es immediately appointed a com|mittee to enquire into the affair, that mea&s;ures might be taken to &s;ecure the peace of the kingdom. This pretended di&s;covery was the foundation of the corpo|ration-act, which was now pa&s;&s;ed in parliament, ordaining all mayors, alder|men, coun&s;ellors, or officers of corporations, to take an oath, importing, that they did not think it lawful, on any pretence whatever, to take arms again&s;t the king; and that they abhorred the dete&s;table maxim of arming again&s;t the king's per&s;on, under the &s;hadow of his authority; or even of op|po&s;ing &s;uch as acted by virtue of his commi&s;&s;ion. This was a mo&s;t &s;candalous conce&s;&s;ion, by which the liberties of England were left at the mercy of regal power. The committee of both hou&s;es proceeded on their enquiry into the nature of the con&s;piracy; and the earl of Clarendon made an alarming report of a de&s;ign to surpri&s;e Shrew&s;bury, Coventry, and Bri&s;tol: but this plot &s;eems to have been no other than a fiction of the mini&s;try, to pave the way for the act of uniformity; for that was no &s;ooner pa&s;&s;ed than the inquiry was laid a&s;ide.</P>

<P>On the fir&s;t day of March, the king &s;ending for the commons to Whitehall, gently reproached them for the little care they had taken to &s;ettle his revenue; mentioned a republican party that &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the kingdom; expre&s;&s;ed uncommon zeal for the church of England; gave them to under&s;tand that he had &s;ent the book of Common Prayer to the lords, with his approba|tion of &s;ome changes which the convocation had thought proper to make in it, that it might be more &s;uitable to an act of uniformity, which he de&s;ired the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1662.</NOTE> lower hou&s;e would prepare, without pa&s;&s;ion or precipitation. The commons were re&s;olved to manife&s;t their obedience in every particular. They brought in a bill to per&s;ecute the quakers for refu&s;ing to take oaths in courts of judicature.
<PB N="411" REF="4130">
On the nineteenth of May, the king gave his a&s;&s;ent to the act for e&s;tabli&s;hing uniformity in public wor&s;hip, and in the admini&s;tration of the &s;acraments. By this &s;tatute, which began to be in force on St. Bartholomew's day, every mini&s;ter was obliged to conform to the wor&s;hip of the Engli&s;h church, ac|cording to the book of Common Prayer lately revi&s;ed, and to &s;ign a declara|tion approving of that ritual; to take the oath of canonical obedience, abjure the &s;olemn league and covenant, and acknowledge his dete&s;tation of the prin|ciple of taking up arms again&s;t the king, or tho&s;e acting by his commi&s;&s;ion, on any pretence what&s;oever. He was likewi&s;e re&s;trained from admini&s;tring the &s;acraments, unle&s;s he had been previou&s;ly ordained by a bi&s;hop. By an act regulating the militia, all lords lieutenants of counties, and their de|puties, together with officers and &s;oldiers, were obliged to declare, upon oath, that they held it unlawful to take arms again&s;t the king, or tho&s;e acting by his commi&s;&s;ion. As another in&s;tance of the parliament's devotion to the king, the commons voted an annual tax of two &s;hillings upon every hearth, to his ma|je&s;ty and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: this impo&s;ition, joined to the tonnage and poundage, the exci&s;e, and duty upon merchandize, augmented his revenue to a much greater &s;um than had ever been payed to any of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>

<P>On the twenty-fir&s;t day of May, the king's marriage with Cathe|rine infanta of Portugal, was celebrated with great magnificence. Though a virtuous prince&s;s, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no per&s;onal attractions; but Charles was cap|tivated by her portion, which amounted to three hundred thou&s;and pounds, to|gether with the fortre&s;s of Tangier in Africa, and Bombay in the Ea&s;t Indies. Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e &s;upplies, the king dealt out his trea&s;ure with &s;uch a lavi&s;h hand, that his coffers were quickly exhau&s;ted; and he was obliged to devi&s;e extraordinary means to recruit his finances. His difficulties were con|&s;iderably increa&s;ed by the expence of maintaining Dunkirk; and therefore he re&s;olved to &s;ell it for a &s;um of money to the French mini&s;try. Clarendon and Southampton, though virtuous mini&s;ters, were both concerned in this tran|&s;action; but, in all probability, the expedient was fir&s;t propo&s;ed by Charles him&s;elf. The chancellor invited D'E&s;trades, the French mini&s;ter at the Hague, to come over to London, where he managed this negotiation; and the French king purcha&s;ed Dunkirk, with all the artillery and ammunition in the place, for the con&s;ideration of four hundred thou&s;and pounds.</P>

<P>While this affair was in agitation, Berk&s;tead, Cobbet, and Okey, three of the regicides, who had e&s;caped to the continent, were di&s;covered, and arre&s;ted in Holland by Downing the Engli&s;h re&s;ident at the Hague, who had formerly &s;erved the commonwealth, and been chaplain to the regiment com|manded by Okey. He now &s;eized and conveyed them on board of an Engli&s;h &s;hip, without giving them time to claim the protection of the &s;tates; and they were executed at Tyburn, where they behaved with equal moderation and de|corum. Their trial was &s;oon followed by that of Sir Henry Vane and general Lambert, who had been excepted from the act of indemnity, as principal authors of the troubles, though they were not in the number of tho&s;e who &s;at in judgment upon the king. Their execution had been &s;u&s;pended, at the interce&s;&s;ion of the convention-parliament; but this, out of its great zeal, petitioned for their trial. Vane was indicted for his conduct after the king's death; and defended him|&s;elf with great ability. He &s;aid, that he had acted in obedience to an e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="412" REF="4140">
authority; and if an acknowledgment of that authority was criminal, the whole nation was guilty: he pleaded the &s;tatute of the &s;eventh Henry, enacting, That no man &s;hould be que&s;tioned for adhering to the e&s;tabli&s;hed prince: he di&s;claimed all the cruelties that had been practi&s;ed upon the parliament and the king: he reminded them of the per&s;ecution he had undergone for oppo&s;ing the u&s;urpation of Cromwell; and ob&s;erved, that although he could have e&s;caped from his enemies, at the re&s;toration, he cho&s;e rather to &s;tay, and give te&s;timony with his blood, to the cau&s;e of liberty which he had e&s;pou&s;ed. The law was &s;trained for his conviction; and he fell, in all probability, a &s;a|crifice to the manes of the earl of Strafford, again&s;t whom he had acted with the mo&s;t rancorous enmity. Though naturally fearful, he was &s;o animated by his enthu&s;ia&s;m, as to bear his fate with fortitude and compo&s;ure. When he was brought to the &s;caffold to &s;uffer decapitation, he &s;poke to the multitude in ju&s;ti|fication of the cau&s;e in which he had embarked; but, he was &s;ilenced by the noi&s;e of drums and trumpets. Lambert was likewi&s;e found guilty and con|demned; but, in con&s;equence of his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive hehaviour at his trial, he ob|tained a reprieve, and was confined to the i&s;land of Guern&s;ey, where he lived twenty years in oblivion.</P>

<P>When the act of uniformity took place, &s;o contrary to the king's declaration from Breda, and &s;o much to the di&s;honour of Charles, two thou&s;and pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters cho&s;e rather to re&s;ign their benefices, and embrace beg|gary, than &s;ub&s;cribe the articles. They thought that the bi&s;hops would not venture to expel &s;uch a number of popular preachers; and, that the king, who was indifferent to all forms of religion, would not &s;uffer his promi&s;e to be vio|lated, on account of any religious di&s;pute. Charles was wholly pa&s;&s;ive on this occa&s;ion. He did, indeed, hate the manners of the pre&s;byterians; but, he was now directed by the earl of Clarendon, who thought it rea&s;onable that the church &s;hould be purged of tho&s;e intruders, who had deformed her beauties, per&s;ecuted her mini&s;ters, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her wealth. In order to mi|tigate in &s;ome mea&s;ure the &s;everity of this act, the king i&s;&s;ued a declaration, promi&s;ing to u&s;e his influence with the parliament, to concur in pa&s;&s;ing a law by which he might be enabled more fully to exert his di&s;pen&s;ing power in favour of tho&s;e who, from con&s;cientious motives, could not comply with the act of uniformity. This was intended as a preliminary to a general toleration, the benefit of which might extend to the catholics, to whom the king had a &s;ecret propensity. They had &s;upported the rights of the crown during the late trou|bles. There was a &s;plendor and magnificence in their mode of wor&s;hip that captivated the fancy of Charles. The importunities of his mother, and the per&s;ua&s;ions of tho&s;e with whom he lived in exile, are &s;aid to have prevailed upon him to embrace that religion; and his brother the duke of York, who had great influence over his conduct, was &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly addicted to popery.</P>

<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by parliament to &s;ee the corporation|act put in execution, u&s;ed their authority with &s;uch rigour, that there was not an officer left in any community, who did not warmly e&s;pou&s;e the principles of the parliament. They moreover demoli&s;hed the walls of Glouce&s;ter, Coventry, Northampton, and Leice&s;ter, becau&s;e the&s;e places in the civil war had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves by their zeal again&s;t monarchy. About the latter end of the year, &s;ix fanatics were executed for having engaged in a con&s;piracy to mur|der
<PB N="413" REF="4150">
the king, his brother, the duke of Albermale, and to &s;urpri&s;e the Tower of London and the ca&s;tle of Wind&s;or. Though no per&s;on of con&s;equence was concerned in this de&s;ign, it was repre&s;ented as a very &s;erious affair by the mi|ni&s;try, who pretended that Ludlow, and all the republican officers, were ready to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.

Ludlow had made his e&s;cape into Switzerland, im|mediately after the re&s;toration; and there he lived without making the lea&s;t attempt to retrieve the fortune of him&s;elf and his a&s;&s;ociates. In the cour&s;e of this year, admiral Law&s;on &s;ailing with a &s;quadron to the coa&s;t of Barbary, com|pelled the dey of Algiers to conclude a peace with England: then the king made Tangier a free-port, and favoured it with particular privileges.</P>

<P>The pre&s;byterians thinking them&s;elves unju&s;tly oppre&s;&s;ed, petitioned the king and council, that they might be exempted from the penalties &s;pecified in the act of uniformity; and his maje&s;ty publi&s;hed a proclamation, declaring, that although he adhered with all his heart to that act; neverthele&s;s, out of re|gard to &s;ome of his &s;ubjects, he was willing to di&s;pen&s;e with their ob&s;erving certain articles therein contained. This indulgence was planned on purpo&s;e to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1663.</NOTE> favour the catholics, and therefore tran&s;acted without the privity and concur|rence of the chancellor, who&s;e credit with the king now began to decline. He was a violent enemy to the papi&s;ts, and therefore hated by the queen-mother, the duke of York, and the earl of Bri&s;tol who had turned Roman catholic during his exile. He now employed all his wit, humour, and vivacity, in ri|diculing the earl of Clarendon, and rendering that faithful mini&s;ter di&s;agreeable in the eyes of his &s;overeign. The chancellor was likewi&s;e dete&s;ted by Mrs. Palmer, the king's favourite concubine, who was afterwards created dutche&s;s of Cleveland. She was a woman abandoned by every &s;entiment of virtue and decorum; proud, revengeful, profligate, and rapacious. Clarendon di&s;dained to flatter her vanity, or gratify her avarice; therefore all her influence upon Charles was u&s;ed to his prejudice. Secretary Nicholas, the chancellor's intimate friend, was deprived of his office, which the king conferred upon his profe&s;&s;ed enemy Sir Henry Bennet, a reputed papi&s;t, who was afterwards created lord Arlington.</P>

<P>Charles has left very few in&s;tances of his gratitude upon record.

A &s;um of money had been once rai&s;ed by the parliament for their relief; but, this was by no means proportioned to their merits and nece&s;|&s;ities. Charles was &s;o prodigal in the articles of his common expence, that he could not &s;upply them from his own revenue; and he found it convenient to employ another &s;ort of people, who&s;e affection it was nece&s;&s;ary to conciliate: &s;o that the unfortunate royali&s;ts being di&s;appointed in their &s;anguine hopes, loudly complained of his ingratitude; but, he fled from their clamours to &s;cenes of mirth, jollity, and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure.</P>

They alledged, that this was no more than a gracious
<PB N="414" REF="4160">
declaration, that he would exert his influence with the parliament in favour of tender con&s;ciences: they ob&s;erved, that as the parliament did not think proper to advi&s;e or countenance &s;uch indulgence, his maje&s;ty was acquitted of all obliga|tion towards nonconformi&s;ts. They enumerated the inconveniences which might ari&s;e from a toleration; and propo&s;ed, as the mo&s;t effectual method to prevent &s;chi&s;ms, troubles, and divi&s;ions, that the laws &s;hould be executed for the &s;up|port of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, according to the act of uniformity. Charles finding his de&s;ign &s;o di&s;agreeable to the commons, thought proper to po&s;tpone it to a more favourable opportunity; but, the two hou&s;es petitioned him, in an|other addre&s;s, to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation, commanding all Roman catholic prie&s;ts and je&s;uits to quit the kingdom, except &s;uch as were in the &s;ervice of the two queens, or belonged to foreign amba&s;&s;adors.

<P>While the commons were employed in &s;ettling the funds for the king's revenue, Charles being reduced to great nece&s;&s;ity, a&s;&s;embled them in the Banquetting-hou&s;e at Whitehall; and, in the clo&s;e of a flattering &s;peech, re|plete with profe&s;&s;ions of eternal gratitude, and the warme&s;t affection, begged a &s;upply for his pre&s;ent occa&s;ions, which he &s;aid were extremely pre&s;&s;ing. They could not re&s;i&s;t his pathetic addre&s;s; and therefore granted him four entire &s;ub|&s;idies: and the convocation of the clergy followed their example. Although the king's affection was by this time in a great mea&s;ure alienated from the earl of Clarendon, he could not forget his faithful &s;ervices and attachment; and therefore that nobleman &s;till retained his office and a certain degree of fa|vour: &s;o that the catholic party began to fear he would retrieve the credit he had lo&s;t. This con&s;ideration, in all probability, induced the earl of Bri&s;tol to impeach the chancellor of high trea&s;on. In this &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tent charge, he was accu&s;ed of having endeavoured to &s;ix the imputation of popery upon the king: of having promi&s;ed to u&s;e his influence in aboli&s;hing the penal laws again&s;t papi&s;ts: of having con&s;ented to &s;ome articles di&s;graceful to the prote&s;t|ant religion, in the treaty for the king's marriage: of having &s;candalized his maje&s;ty: advi&s;ed the &s;ale of Dunkirk: reviled both hou&s;es of parliament: en|riched him&s;elf by &s;elling employments; and embezzled the public money. This impeachment appeared &s;o void of all foundation and probability, that it was rejected by the lords; and the earl of Bri&s;tol was &s;o much a&s;hamed of his conduct, that for &s;ome time he did not appear in public.</P>

<P>In this &s;e&s;&s;ion the commons granted to the duke of York, the profits ari&s;ing from the po&s;t and wine-licence offices: &s;o that he was enabled to<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> keep a &s;eparate court, and live altogether independent of his brother. The par|liament being prorogued to the &s;ixteenth day of March, the king and queen made a progre&s;s into the we&s;tern counties; and were entertained with great magnificence by the univer&s;ity of Oxford.

Ch. 1664.</NOTE> to the trade of the nation, voted, That the wrongs, affronts, and in|dignities, offered by the Dutch, in the Indies, Africa, and el&s;ewhere, to the &s;ubjects of England, had in a great mea&s;ure, ob&s;tructed the trade of the na|tion: That his maje&s;ty &s;hould be intreated to procure reparation for the&s;e wrongs, and take mea&s;ures for preventing &s;uch injuries for the future; for which purpo&s;es the two hou&s;es would a&s;&s;i&s;t him to their utmo&s;t power again&s;t all op|po&s;ers. This was the prelude of a war with Holland, upon which the king had been for &s;ome time determined. Nothing more frivolous could be a&s;&s;igned for engaging in this enterprize. In &s;pecifying particulars, the Dutch were charged with having taken two Engli&s;h &s;hips in the Ea&s;t-Indies; but, they alledged, that tho&s;e &s;hips had been employed in carrying on an illicit commerce, and the &s;tates had actually depo&s;ited a &s;um of money exceeding the value of them, until the Engli&s;h court of admiralty could determine the merit of the cau&s;e. The war owed its origin to other motives. Charles, who&s;e prodigality kept him always nece&s;&s;itous, fore&s;aw that he &s;hould be able to convert to his private u&s;e part of the &s;upplies granted for the maintenance of the war: he delighted in &s;hip-building; and was ambitious of equipping a navy that &s;hould give law to all the maritime &s;tates in Europe: his brother longed for an opportunity to &s;ignalize his courage and power as high-admiral, again&s;t a people he hated, not only for their republican principles, but al&s;o as one of the chief bulwarks of the prote&s;tant religion: the trading part of the nation looked upon the Dutch as the mo&s;t dangerous rivals in commerce; and the royal African company, in particular, had been thwarted by the Dutch in fixing their &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Guiney.</P>

<P>The two hou&s;es having pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king on the &s;ubject of their vote, he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at this in&s;tance of their zeal for the advancement of commerce; &s;aid, he would examine the particular com|plaints which had been made again&s;t the &s;ubjects of the &s;tates-general, and order his mini&s;ter at the Hague to demand immediate reparation. In&s;tructions were &s;ent to Downing for this purpo&s;e; but, in the mean time, the duke of York, as governor of the royal African company, &s;ent Sir Robert Holmes with a &s;quadron to di&s;tre&s;s the Dutch &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Guiney. He drove them from Cape de Verd; built a fort at the mouth of the river Gambia; made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Cape-cor&s;e ca&s;tle, and took a great number of their trading ve&s;&s;els. From thence he &s;ailed to America, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Nova Belgia, which changed its name to that of New-York. At this very juncture, admiral de Ruyter and Sir John Law&s;on had &s;ailed with combined &s;quadrons again&s;t the cor&s;airs of Algiers. The &s;tates were no &s;ooner informed of the ho&s;|tilities committed upon their &s;ubjects by Holmes, than they di&s;patched private orders to De Ruyter, importing, that he &s;hould &s;ail to the coa&s;t of Guiney, and make repri&s;als on the Engli&s;h. He accordingly undertook the voyage, re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed the Dutch in all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, expelled the Engli&s;h from &s;ome of their old &s;ettlements, and made prize of all the &s;hips that fell into his hands.
<PB N="416" REF="4180">
Then he &s;ailed to the We&s;t Indies, where he was repul&s;ed in an attack upon Ba$$adoes; and afterwards made att$mpts upon &s;ome of the Engli&s;h colonies in North America.</P>

<P>Downing, the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter at the Hague, pre&s;ented a me|morial to the &s;tates$ demanding &s;atisfaction for the damages done to the Engli&s;$, which, he &s;$id$ amounted to &s;even or eight hundred thou&s;and pounds; and they being willing to avoid a war, &s;ent over Van Go$h, as an amba&s;&s;ador extraor$inary to London, to compromi&s;e the differences between the two na|tions. When he complained of the ho&s;tilities committed by Holmes, Charles pretended this was a private difference between two companies, of which h$ would not pretend to take cognizance; and he excu&s;ed his having prohibited the importation of merchandize from Holland, on account of the plague, which had been introduced into that country. Neverthele&s;s he continued to make preparations for war with &s;urpri&s;ing indu&s;try. He borrowed one hundred $$ou&s;and pounds of the citizens of London, who were plea&s;ed with the pro&s;pect of a war that threatened de&s;truction to their rivals; and he vi&s;ited all the docks in per&s;on, that his pre&s;ence might quicken the diligence of the workmen. In the month of November, the duke of York &s;et &s;ail with a &s;quadron, and falling in with a fleet of Dutch merchant &s;hips, took one hundred and thirty ve&s;&s;els, which were detained as lawful prize, though war was not yet declared. The French king offered his mediation, which was ac|cepted by the $tates-general: but Charles refu&s;ed to enter into any negotiation, until he &s;hould have received entire &s;$tisfaction for the lo&s;&s;es and in&s;ults which his &s;ubjects had &s;u&s;tained.</P>

<P>The parliament, before its la&s;t prorogation, had pa&s;&s;ed an act again&s;t conventicles, ordaining that every per&s;on convicted of having been pre&s;ent at a religious meeting of di&s;&s;enters, &s;hould be fined in five pounds for the fir&s;t offence, ten for the &s;econd, and for the third be tran&s;ported to the plantations: by this law the pre&s;byterians were excluded from all benefit of the declaration from Breda. When the two hou&s;es met on the twenty-fourth day of November, the king gave them to under&s;tand, that upon his own credit, he had equipped the &s;tronge&s;t fleet that ever England owned; and that as he had expended eight hundred thou&s;and pounds on this armament, he hoped the commons would indulge him with proportionable &s;upplies. He &s;aid the &s;tates had, by numberle&s;s artifices, eluded every rea&s;onable propo&s;al for a pacification; and he a&s;&s;ured them, that, &s;hould he be compelled to en|gage in ho&s;tilities, he would never li&s;ten to any overtures of peace, until after having obtained tho&s;e ends for which the war &s;hould be undertaken. The commons were &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to concur with his de&s;ires, that they forthwith voted a &s;upply of two millions five hundred thou&s;and pounds for the main|tenance<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burn$$.

Mean while the Dutch did not neglect to p$t them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence. When the news of De Ruyter's progre&s;s on the coa&s;t of Guiney, and in the We&s;t Indies, arrived in England, the king pub$$$$ed a &s;olemn declaration of war again&s;t the United Provinces, with the un$n$mous con&s;ent of all the privy coun&s;ellors, except the earls of

<P>Lewis XIV. being importuned by the Dutch to declare again&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1665.</NOTE> England, in con&s;equence of the la&s;t treaty which he had concluded with the &s;tates-general, and &s;ollicited by Charles to ob&s;erve a neutrality, was for &s;ome time divided in his &s;entiments. He was loth to di&s;oblige Charles, le&s;t he &s;hould throw him&s;elf into the arms of Spain, whither he had lately &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y; and, on the other hand, it was his intere&s;t to &s;upport De Wit and the Love&s;tein party in Holland again&s;t the prince of Orange, who naturally claimed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his uncle the king of England. In order to gain time, he &s;ent the duke de Vernueil, at the head of a &s;plendid emba&s;&s;y, to London, with offers of mediating a peace between England and the United Provinces; and there they continued till the latter end of the &s;ucceeding year, though their endeavours did not meet with &s;ucce&s;s. The duke of York putting to &s;ea in the month of May, before the Dutch fleet was a&s;&s;embled, &s;ailed towards the coa&s;t of Holland, and cruized near the Texel fifteen days, during which he took a great number of their &s;hips homeward-bound; then he retired to Harwich road. After his departure, the fleets of Holland and Zealand joined, to the number of one hundred and twenty one, exclu&s;ive of fire&s;hips, under the command of admiral Opdam, Cortenaer, Evertzen, and Cornelius Van Tromp, &s;on of the celebrated Martin Van Tromp, who lo&s;t his life in the late war. This armament was fitted out by the advice, vigi|lance, and activity of John De Wit, pen&s;ionary of Holland, a man of very exten&s;ive talents, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;pirit of an old Greek republican. He had always oppo&s;ed the growing power of the hou&s;e of Orange, le&s;t it &s;hould one day en&s;lave his country. His intere&s;t now predominated in the common|wealth; and he re&s;olved to hazard a general engagement with the Engli&s;h, becau&s;e, even if the Dutch navy &s;hould be defeated, that event would induce the French king to declare for the republic.</P>

<P>Opdam therefore $ailed in que&s;t of the Engli&s;h fleet, and de&s;cried it near Colche&s;ter; but the wind changing &s;o as to blow from the &s;outh-we&s;t, he bore away for the mouth of the Meu&s;e, rather than engage the enemy, while they had the advantage of the weather-gage. He received a fre&s;h order from the &s;tates, com$anding him, upon pain of death, to $$ght the Engli&s;h, whatever might be the &s;tate of the weather. He forthwith weighed anchor on the third day of June; and in a few hours fell in with the Engli&s;h fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred and fourteen &s;ail, exclu&s;ive of fire&s;hips and ketches, under the command of the duke of York, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by prince Rupert and the earl of Sandwich, with Penn, Law&s;on, Sir George Ay&s;cue, and &s;ome other inferior admirals. The engagement began at four in the morning, and both &s;ides fought with their u&s;ual intrepidity. The duke of York was in the hotte&s;t part of the battle, and behaved with great &s;pirit and compo&s;ure, even when the earl of Falmouth, the lord Mu&s;kerry, and Mr. Boyle were killed at his &s;ide by one cannon-ball, which covered him with the blood and brains of

the&s;e three gallant gentlemen. He was clo&s;ely engaged with Opdam, while that officer peri&s;hed by his &s;hip's blowing up; his flag was hoi&s;ted by Cor|tenaer, who likewi&s;e fell in the battle: a good number of the Dutch captains had been promoted in the &s;ervice by the intere&s;t of the prevailing faction, without any regard to merit, and &s;ome of the&s;e were deficient in point of courage. In a word, the enemy was defeated, with the lo&s;s of nineteen &s;hips either burned or $unk in the action, and about &s;ix thou&s;and men. The vic|tory co&s;t the Engli&s;h three or four &s;hips, and fifteen hundred men, among whom was vice-admiral Law&s;on, an officer of great valour and experience: the Dutch fleet were chanced to the coa&s;t of Holland, Van Tromp &s;ecuring their retreat with equal valour and di&s;cretion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This victory might have been much more compleat, had not Brouncker, a gentleman of the duke's bedchamber, de$ired Penn, in his ma$$er's name, to $lacke$ $ail, while they were in p$r&s;uit of the enemy. The duke had retired to re&s;t$ af$er having given order to carry all their $ail, and wake him when they &s;hould be $p with the c$ace. When $e awoke, and &s;aw they had $hortened $$il, he expre$$ed equal &s;urprize and di&s;plea&s;ure; and Brouncker was turned out of his $ervice. Some people imagined this man had made $&s;e of the duke's name without his autho|rity, in con&s;equence of an injunction of the dutche&s;s, who had directed him to take all op|portunities of con&s;ulting his ma&s;ter's per&s;onal &s;afety. Others alledge that the duke's courage was exha$&s;$ed; and that he was affected by an expre&s;&s;ion of Penn, who, at a council of war, $aid, they mu&s;t prepare for a hotter engagement; for, the courage of the Dutch w$s never &s;o high as when they were reduced to de&s;pair. <BIBL>Bur$et.</BIBL></NOTE>. The duke of York &s;ailing back to England, left the fleet at anchor, and repaired to London, where he was received amid&s;t the acclamations of the people.

The king and council would not &s;uffer the duke to expo&s;e his per&s;on to the danger of a &s;econd engagement; and therefore the command of the fleet devolved upon the earl of Sandwich.</P>

<P>The Dutch fleet of merchant &s;hips, from Turkey and the Ea&s;t Indies, having &s;ailed north about, in order to avoid the Engli&s;h cruizers, anchored in the port of Berghen in Norway, where they lay until De Ruyter &s;hould come and conduct them to Holland. Sir Gilbert Talbot, the Engli&s;h envoy at Copenhagen, propo&s;ed to the king of Denmark, that he &s;hould &s;eize all tho&s;e &s;hips, which were richly laden, by way of revenge upon the Dutch, who, he &s;aid, had involved him in a trouble&s;ome war with Sweden. The Dani&s;h king was tempted by the richne&s;s of the prize; but ob&s;erved, he was not in a condition to execute &s;uch a de&s;ign. Talbot promi&s;ed to procure the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h fleet, provided he would recompence the captors with one half of what they &s;hould take: the bargain was &s;truck between the two monarchs; and Charles ordered the earl of Sandwich to $et $ail imme|diately for Berghe$. The earl detached Sir Thomas Tiddeman, with part of the fleet, on that &s;ervice, and $e attacked the Dutch with great impetuo&s;ity: but the governor of Berghen, who had not yet received orders to remain pa&s;|&s;ive, joined the Hollanders in giving him &s;uch a warm reception, that he was obliged to quit the enterprize, after having received con&s;iderable damage. Charles was not a little chagrined at the di&s;appointment; and &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed

with the earl of Sandwich, for having omitted to &s;ail thither in per&s;on, that he was deprived of his command, and &s;ent on an emba&s;&s;y to Madrid. De Ruyter having returned from America with a good number of Engli&s;h prizes, was promoted to the office of lieutenant-admiral-general, and immediately ve&s;ted with the command of a fleet of ninety-three &s;ail, in excellent order. The pen&s;ionary De Wit, Huygens, and Boreel, embarked as commi&s;&s;ioners from the &s;tates. They, with great difficulty, &s;ailed from the Texel through a new pa&s;&s;age which De Wit now di&s;covered by &s;ounding. They arrived at Berghen, and took their trade under convoy; but they were di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;torm, and &s;ome of them fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h; the re&s;t of the fleet returned to Holland, in a &s;hattered condition.</P>

<P>At this period, the plague made terrible havoc in London, where it &s;wept off above one hundred thou&s;and of the inhabitants. The king, in order to avoid the contagion, retired to Hampton-court, from whence he removed his hou&s;hold to Sali&s;bury; but, this city being &s;oon infected, he cho&s;e his re&s;idence at Oxford. Charles had excited the famous Bernard Van Ghalen bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter, to take arms again&s;t the &s;tates-general, in con&s;i|deration of receiving a large &s;ub&s;idy from England. This turbulent prelate a&s;&s;embled a body of twenty thou&s;and men, with which he invaded the pro|vince of Overy&s;&s;el, and reduced &s;everal places: but the French king and the dukes of Lunenburg &s;ending a con&s;iderable reinforcement to the Dutch army, and the &s;ub&s;idy from England being ill payed, he was glad to li&s;ten to terms of accommodation.</P>

<P>The parliament meeting at Oxford in the beginning of October, granted twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds to the king for the &s;upport of the war, and one hundred thou&s;and to the duke of York, in acknowledgment of his &s;ignal &s;ervices. Then they pa&s;&s;ed the famous "Five mile act," by which every nonconforming preacher was bani&s;hed five miles from the place where he had been mini&s;ter, after the act of indemnity, unle&s;s he would take the oath of non-re&s;i&s;tance. They were treated in this manner, on pretence that they had endeavoured to poi&s;on the minds of the people, by in&s;tilling into them the principles of &s;chi&s;m and rebellion. Though this per&s;ecution was &s;et on foot by the chancellor, who was the implacable enemy of the pre&s;|byterians, the bill met with great oppo&s;ition in the upper hou&s;e, from his in|timate friend the earl of Southampton. The &s;ame &s;ect was per&s;ecuted with equal &s;everity in Scotland, though the majority of that nation were pre&s;by|terians. The nonjuring mini&s;ters were commanded by a proclamation to re|move, with their families, to the di&s;tance of twenty miles from the places where they u&s;ed to re&s;ide, on pain of incurring the penalty annexed to &s;edi|tious practices. The&s;e people would have been reduced to a deplorable &s;itua|tion, had not the charity of their friends increa&s;ed, in proportion to the &s;everity of the government.</P>

After he had &s;ailed on this expedition, De Ruyter appeared between Newport and Dunkirk, with &s;eventy-one &s;hips of the line, twelve frigates, thirteen fire|&s;hips, and eight yachts; Evertzen and Tromp acting as inferior admirals. The duke of Albemarle, though greatly inferior in number to the enemy, bore down upon them without he&s;itation, on the fir&s;t day of June; and the Dutch captains were &s;o eager to engage, that they ordered their cables to be cut, that they might be the &s;ooner able to clo&s;e with the Engli&s;h. The battle began with incredible fury: Tromp, and afterwards De Ruyter, were obliged to &s;hift their flags, becau&s;e their &s;hips had &s;u&s;tained &s;uch damage that they were in danger of &s;inking; one of their fleet was blown up, and admiral Evertzen killed with a cannon ball. On the other hand, Sir William Berkeley, who led the van of the Engli&s;h, &s;teered into the mid&s;t of the enemy, where his &s;hip was overpowered and taken, after a gallant re&s;i&s;tance, in which he lo&s;t his life: one or two Engli&s;h &s;hips were &s;unk, notwith&s;tanding the valour and acti|vity of Albemarle, who, though in the decline of life, fought with all the ardour and vivacity of a youthful warrior. Night parted the combatants; but next day, the weather being more moderate, the fight was renewed with re|doubled violence. Van Tromp having engaged him&s;elf too far among the Engli&s;h, would have been taken, had not De Ruyter come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and brought him off. The&s;e two admirals were of oppo&s;ite factions, and rivals for glory: they were in&s;pired with emulation, and fought with equal conduct and re&s;olution. The Dutch being joined with a reinforcement of &s;ixteen &s;hips, and the Engli&s;h fleet &s;hattered in &s;uch a manner, that not above eight and twenty &s;ail remained fit for &s;ervice, the duke of Albemarle was obliged to &s;heer off and retreat towards the coa&s;t of England, followed by the victorious enemy, who had come up with him towards the evening, when a calm prevented them from beginning a fre&s;h attack. In the morning of the third day, Albemarle hav|ing made a previous di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ent the di&s;abled &s;hips a head, while he him&s;elf remained in the rear with tho&s;e that were &s;till capable of &s;ervice, &s;o as to form a line a-&s;tern occa&s;ionally for the reception of the pur&s;uers. About two o'clock, when the Dutch were almo&s;t within gun-&s;hot, the duke de&s;cried prince Rupert and his &s;quadron to the &s;outhward, crouding all their &s;ails to come up with him, and immediately hauled upon a wind to join this reinforcement. Sir George Ay$cue, in a &s;hip of one hundred guns, had the misfortune to &s;trike on the Galloper $$$ds, where he was &s;urrounded and taken. The two Engli&s;h fleets having joined, prepared for another engagement, and in the morning bore down upon the Dutch, who waited for them without flinching. A fourth

battle was now begun with equal rage and re&s;olution on both &s;ides, and con|tinued until it was interrupted by a thick fog, when the Engli&s;h found them|&s;elves &s;o maltreated, that they took this opportunity to retire, with the lo&s;s of divers large &s;hips that were &s;unk or taken by the enemy. Both &s;ides claimed the victory; but the Dutch had certainly obtained the advantage, though there was no glory lo&s;t by either nation.</P>

<P>Both fleets were &s;oon refitted; and De Ruyter was ordered to put to &s;ea, to join the duke de Beaufort with the French &s;quadron. On the twenty-fourth day of July, he fell in with the Engli&s;h fleet, commanded by prince Rupert and the duke of Albemarle: it amounted to above one hundred &s;ail, while that of the &s;tates did not exceed eighty-eight &s;hips of war and nineteen fire&s;hips. The battle began near the mouth of the Thames, and was fought with equal rage and emulation. Sir Thomas Allen, vice-admiral of the white, defeated the van of the enemy, and three of their inferior ad|mirals were &s;lain. In the mean time Sir Jeremy Smith, vice-admiral of the blue, was wor&s;ted by Van Tromp, who followed the chace &s;o far that he was entirely &s;eparated from the center. De Ruyter being overpowered by numbers, &s;u&s;tained the engagement till night with difficulty; and was next day attacked by the whole force of the Engli&s;h navy. He bore the &s;hock with un&s;haken re&s;olution, and gained more glory by his retreat than the Engli&s;h acquired by their victory. They followed him to the coa&s;t of Flu&s;hing, and then &s;ailed in que&s;t of Tromp, whom they de&s;cried near Harwich; but, in &s;pite of all their efforts, he retreated with very little lo&s;s, to the Texel. He was of the Orange faction, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have de&s;erted De Ruyter from motives of animo&s;ity. This admiral having complained of his conduct, he was put under arre&s;t, and his commi&s;&s;ion be&s;towed upon another officer. The duke of Albemarle detached Holmes, with a &s;quadron, to in&s;ult the coa&s;t of Holland. In the road of Vlye he burned a great number of ve&s;&s;els, and two &s;hips of war appointed for their convoy: then he made a de&s;cent upon the i&s;land of Schelling, and reduced the town of Brandaris to a&s;hes. After this expedition, the Engli&s;h fleet took their &s;tation near the I&s;le of Wight, to hinder the junction of the French and Dutch &s;quadrons, while De Ruyter anchored in the road of St. John, near Boulogne. There he was taken dangerou&s;ly ill of a contagious di&s;temper, which had made terrible havock among the &s;eamen; and the &s;tates thought proper to recall him to Holland. The duke of Beau|fort, thinking they were &s;till in the neighbourhood of Boulogne, &s;ailed up the channel as far as Dieppe, and then directed his cour&s;e to the coa&s;t of Britanny, without &s;uffering the lea&s;t mole&s;tation from the Engli&s;h.</P>

<P>About this period, London was expo&s;ed to a terrible di&s;a&s;ter from a conflagration which broke out on the third day of September, in the hou&s;e of a baker that lived on Fi&s;h-&s;treet Hill, near the Bridge. The flames, augmented by a &s;trong ea&s;terly wind, raged with &s;urpri&s;ing violence. They de&s;troyed &s;ix hundred &s;treets, including eighty-nine churches, many ho&s;pitals and public edifices, and thirteen thou&s;and two hundred private hou&s;es. The ruins, comprehending four hundred and thirty-&s;ix acres of ground, extended from the Tower along the river to the Temple church, and north-ea&s;terly along the city-walls as far as Holborn bridge. The conflagration continued three days, notwith&s;tanding all the endeavours that could be u&s;ed to &s;top its

progre&s;s, the king and the duke a&s;&s;i&s;ting per&s;onally on hor&s;eback, from the fir&s;t alarm to its total ce&s;&s;ation. At length, when all hope had vani&s;hed, and the wretched inhabitants were overwhelmed with con&s;ternation and de&s;pair, it &s;uddenly cea&s;ed, and was entirely extingui&s;hed, after having reduced many thou&s;and families from affluence to mi&s;ery, and the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing city in Europe to a deplorable heap of rubbi&s;h. Neverthele&s;s the &s;pirit of the people did not &s;ink under this calamity. London &s;oon ro&s;e more beautiful from its a&s;hes. The king, by a &s;tretch of the prerogative, regulated the plans of the new &s;treets, &s;o as to render them more &s;pacious and convenient than tho&s;e which had been burned; and he prohibited the u&s;e of lath and timber, as materials for the con&s;truction of the hou&s;es. The narrowne&s;s of the &s;treets had not only &s;ubjected them to ca&s;ualties of this nature, but al&s;o prevented a free circulation of air, which, being impregnated with animal vapours, was apt to putrify, and produce infectious di&s;tempers, in&s;omuch that London was &s;carce ever free from a contagion; whereas no &s;uch di&s;temper has appeared &s;ince the city was rebuilt.</P>

<P>The fire of London was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the effect of malicious de&s;ign, and variou&s;ly imputed to the Roman catholics and the republicans, as the &s;tream of prejudice happened to run; though it does not appear how &s;uch a &s;cheme could contribute to the intere&s;t of either party. The populace generally exclaimed again&s;t the catholics as the authors of this conflagration. The parliament appointed a committee to make a &s;evere &s;crutiny on this &s;ubject, but nothing appeared to the prejudice of the papi&s;ts; yet the mi&s;chief is charged upon them in the in&s;cription engraved on the pillar that was erected as a monument of this calamity. A French Huguenot was apprehended, and convicted on his own confe&s;&s;ion: he appeared to be lunatic, and the &s;hip|ma&s;ter, in who&s;e ve&s;&s;el he had been conveyed from Rouen, declared that he did not arrive in London till the conflagration was begun; neverthele&s;s he was condemned and executed. When the parliament met in September, they voted the &s;um of one million eight hundred thou&s;and pounds for the &s;upport of the war: but as the nation in general imputed the conflagration to the ca|tholics, and the king was ob&s;erved to countenance &s;ome per&s;ons of that per&s;ua&s;ion, they petitioned that the laws might be put in execution again&s;t Romi&s;h prie&s;ts and je&s;uits. He forthwith i&s;&s;ued a proclamation for this purpo&s;e; yet the delinquents were &s;o favourably dealt with, that the people, and even the parliament, began to take umbrage at the admini&s;tration.</P>

<P>The rigour exerci&s;ed again&s;t the presbyterians in Scotland, under the direction of archbi&s;hop Sharp, produced &s;ome violent di&s;orders in that kingdom. In the month of November, the people of the we&s;tern &s;hires ran to arms, and &s;urpri&s;ed Turner, who was quartered at Dumfries with an incon&s;iderable num|ber of &s;oldiers. At Lanerk in Clidde&s;dale they held a &s;olemn fa&s;t, renewed the covenant, and publi&s;hed a declaration. They declared that they had taken arms again&s;t the king; they complained of the oppre&s;&s;ion under which they groaned; they demanded that epi&s;copacy &s;hould be aboli&s;hed; and that presbytery, with the covenant and their mini&s;ters, &s;hould be re&s;tored. Dalziel, with &s;ome troops of hor&s;e, was &s;ent again&s;t tho&s;e in&s;urgents; and, by proclamation, offered pardon to all tho&s;e who &s;hould, in four and twenty hours, return to their hou&s;es. They marched towards Edinburgh, in hope of being joined by the inha|bitants
<PB N="423" REF="4250">
of that city; but, being di&s;appointed in their expectation, they began to be di&s;couraged, and dropped off &s;o fa&s;t, that their number was reduced from two thou&s;and to nine hundred. They re&s;olved to retreat to the We&s;t, where they knew the people were well affected to their cau&s;e; but, Dalziel charging them at Pentland hills, they were immediately routed and di&s;per&s;ed. Forty were killed on the &s;pot, about one hundred and thirty taken; and the re&s;t e&s;caped by the darkne&s;s of the night. They were poor, innocent enthu&s;ia&s;ts; the objects of compa&s;&s;ion rather than of re&s;entment; they had injured no per&s;on in their march, but payed regularly for their provi&s;ion, and &s;pent their time in &s;ermons, p&s;alm-&s;inging, and prayer. Forty of the&s;e poor wretches cho&s;e to be hanged rather than renounce the covenant; and bore their fate like martyrs. One Maccail, a preacher, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to know their corre&s;pondents who had encouraged them to take up arms, was put to the torture, which he endured without flinching, and expired in a rapture of religious joy; exclaiming, in a clear, di&s;tinct voice, <Q>&startq;Farewell &s;un, moon, and &s;tars! farewell kindred and friends! farewell world and time! farewell weak and frail body! wel|come eternity! welcome angels and &s;aints! welcome Saviour of the world! and welcome God the judge of all!&endq;</Q> This &s;everity was expre&s;ly contrary to the inclinations of the king; who, in a letter to the earl of Rothes, the com|mi&s;&s;ioner, de&s;ired that no more blood might be &s;hed; that the pri&s;oners &s;hould be &s;et at liberty, on their promi&s;ing to obey the laws for the future; and that tho&s;e who &s;hould refu&s;e to &s;ubmit &s;hould be &s;ent to the plantations. The&s;e executions, and many other in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion were countenanced by Sharp and Burnet, archbi&s;hops of St. Andrew's and Gla&s;gow.</P>

<P>The commons of England had by this time con&s;iderably abated in their complai&s;ance to his maje&s;ty. In&s;tead of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the money bill, they were employed in drawing up an impeachment of lord Mordaunt, governor of Wind&s;or ca&s;tle, for having acted tyrannically in that &s;tation. They pre&s;ented the articles to the upper hou&s;e, and complained at the &s;ame time, that he was permitted to keep his place among the peers, while the articles of his impeach|ment were recited. The upper hou&s;e, on the other hand, blamed the com|mons for having infringed the right of the peers, by impo&s;ing an oath upon the commi&s;&s;ioners, whom they appointed to receive the money ari&s;ing from the capitation tax: and the&s;e &s;ubjects of conte&s;t produced divers fruitle&s;s confe|rences. At length the poll-tax pa&s;&s;ed, though the king complained of their having named commi&s;&s;ioners, as a mark of the little confidence they repo&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burne$. Rapin.

<P>Charles was now tired of the war, from which he had reaped no &s;olid<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1667.</NOTE> advantage. Overtures of peace had been made, and the king of Sweden had offered his mediation. The &s;tates-general were willing that things &s;hould be reduced to the &s;ame &s;ituation in which they had been before the war; or that each &s;ide &s;hould keep the advantages they had gained. This alternative was &s;o equitable, that nothing &s;eemed wanting but the formality of a treaty: the king, however, po&s;tponed the negotiation until he &s;hould receive the &s;upplies from parliament, part of which he re&s;olved to convert to his own private pur|po&s;es. The&s;e being obtained, he determined to treat in earne&s;t; but in&s;i&s;ted upon opening the congre&s;s at London. The &s;tates declared they had no objection to that propo&s;al, but the con&s;ideration of their allies, the kings of France and
<PB N="424" REF="4260">
Denmark, who refu&s;ed to treat in any part of England. Then Charles propo&s;ed the Hague, in hope of being able to influence the deliberations by means of the Orange faction; but the pen&s;ionary perceived his drift, and this place was judged improper. At length all parties agreed that the conferences &s;hould be opened in May at Breda. Thither lord Hollis and Mr. Coventry were &s;ent, as plenipo|tentiaries from England; while tho&s;e of France, Denmark, and Holland, repaired to the &s;ame place; as well as two amba&s;&s;adors from the king of Swe|den, under who&s;e mediation the conference were carried on. Charles in&s;i&s;ted upon the re&s;titution of the two &s;hips which had been taken before the war, and the i&s;land of Poleron in the Ea&s;t Indies, which had been wre&s;ted from the Eng|li&s;h, re&s;tored by a &s;ub&s;equent treaty, and now retaken &s;ince the commencement of the war. It was a &s;pice-i&s;land, and though the Dutch had delivered it to the Engli&s;h, according to treaty, they carefully grubbed up all the clove trees before it was &s;urrendered. Notwith&s;tanding this precaution, they knew it might have been ea&s;ily replanted, &s;o as in a few years to interfere with their &s;pice|trade, and therefore tenaciou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon retaining it in their own hands.</P>

<P>Charles, at length, relaxed in this article, and looked upon the peace as already concluded. He had ordered all his large &s;hips to be unrigged, and kept only a &s;mall &s;quadron of crui&s;ers in commi&s;&s;ion. De Wit re&s;olved to take the advantage of his negligence: the preparations in Holland were con|tinued without cea&s;ing; and De Ruyter, &s;ailing from the Texel with fifty &s;hips of the line, &s;teered directly to the river Thames, at the mouth of which he arrived on the tenth day of June. He attacked Sheerne&s;s fort, which was ea&s;ily taken: he broke down a &s;trong chain drawn acro&s;s the mouth of the river Medway, and de&s;troyed three guard&s;hips moored within-&s;ide for its pro|tection. He cleared a pa&s;&s;age through &s;ome ve&s;&s;els which had been &s;unk in the channel by order of the duke of Albemarle: then &s;ailed up the river as far as Upnore ca&s;tle, which was reduced. Then they burned three &s;hips of the line, after having met with a de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance; and fell down the Medway, with a re&s;olution to attempt the river Thames. By this time the whole coa&s;t was alarmed, and London filled with con&s;ternation. Ships were &s;unk at Wool|wich and Blackwall; platforms rai&s;ed in different places, and provided with ar|tillery; the trained-bands drawn out, and the city of London put into a po&s;ture of defence. De Ruyter, &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding in the Thames, &s;et &s;ail for Port&s;mouth, which he in vain attempted to reduce; then he directed his cour&s;e to Torbay, where he took &s;ome Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els. He made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon Plymouth: from thence he &s;ailed up the channel; in&s;ulted Har|wich, chaced a &s;quadron commanded by Sir Edward Sprague, penetrated once more into the river Thames, and kept all the &s;ea-ports on that &s;ide of the i&s;land in terror and confu&s;ion. The people were fired with indignation to &s;ee them|&s;elves expo&s;ed to the in&s;ult of an enemy whom they had formerly contemned. They loudly exclaimed again&s;t the king, who had converted the public money to his own private u&s;e, and left the nation defencele&s;s.</P>

The only gainers by this war were the two royal brothers.

<P>The king was no &s;tranger to the murmurs of the people, who com|plained bitterly of his conduct; not only on account of the late di&s;grace, but likewi&s;e of his having concluded an inglorious peace, after the war had co&s;t &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums of money. They accu&s;ed him of having deceived the par|liament, in declaring he would never lay his arms a&s;ide until he &s;hould have received ample &s;atisfaction from the enemy: they taxed him with having em|bezzled the &s;upply: they blamed him for his partiality to catholics; and, in par|ticular, for having be&s;towed the office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate upon the earl of Ar|lington, a reputed papi&s;t: they were &s;candalized at his lewd life and the irregu|larities of his court, which was become a &s;cene of buffoonery and intemperance. The king thought it was nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome &s;acrifice to the di&s;contents of the &s;ubjects, and pitched upon Clarendon as a proper victim. Charles looked upon that nobleman as a trouble&s;ome cen&s;or, who di&s;approved of his conduct, and was a check upon his plea&s;ures. The favourite mi&s;tre&s;s railed at the earl without cea&s;ing; the duke of Buckingham and other courtiers ridiculed his cha|racter and deportment. The king received intimation that the chancellor had oppo&s;ed a &s;cheme projected by &s;ome members of the lower hou&s;e, for &s;et|tling a revenue of two millions upon his maje&s;ty; and this oppo&s;ition, which flowed from a love to his country, was con&s;trued into an unpardonable offence again&s;t his &s;overeign. His gravity and inflexible virtue operated as a continual reproach upon the levity and di&s;&s;olute morals of Charles, who had been long di&s;gu&s;ted by his manners, even while he re&s;pected his talents and fidelity: but what incen&s;ed the king again&s;t him beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of forgivene&s;s, was the part he acted in the marriage of the duke of Richmond. Charles was enamoured of Mrs. Stuart, whom he had tempted with all the allurements which a crown could enable him to exhibit; but, finding her cha&s;tity impregnable, he enter|tained thoughts of procuring a divorce from the queen, and rai&s;ing Mr. Stuart to the place of his lawful confort. The earl of Clarendon, who knew his de&s;ign, is &s;aid to have promoted a match between this young lady and the duke of Richmond, that his grand-children might not be excluded from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne, by the i&s;&s;ue of the king's &s;econd marriage. The duke of Rich|mond, who was captivated by the beauty of Mrs. Stuart, e&s;pou&s;ed her in private; and the king was &s;o exa&s;perated at the match, that he not only bani&s;hed the duke from court, but reviled Clarendon with the mo&s;t bitter reproaches. That nobleman had the misfortune to be very unpopular at this juncture; and his friend the earl of Southampton was lately dead. The presbyterians, a power|ful and numerous &s;ect, hated Clarendon as the author of all the per&s;ecution they had undergone. He was abhorred by the catholics as the great ob&s;tacle to all their hopes of favour and toleration; and the people, in general, blamed him for the &s;ale of Dunkirk. He was employed in building an expen&s;ive hou&s;e, while the plague depopulated the city of London; and purcha&s;ed &s;ome &s;tones, which, before the fire of London, had been &s;et apart for rebuilding St. Paul's cathedral. The prejudiced vulgar be&s;towed the name of Dunkirk|hou&s;e
<PB N="426" REF="4280" MS="Y">
on this new edifice: they looked upon the execution of his de&s;ign at that juncture, as an in&s;ult upon the calamities of the nation, and exclaimed again&s;t the impiety of u&s;ing, in his own hou&s;e, the materials which had been provided for the hou&s;e of God. All the&s;e concurring cau&s;es were more than &s;ufficient to effect the di&s;grace of this mini&s;ter. The king, on pretence of &s;atisfying the people, deprived him of the office of chancellor, and Sir Orlando Bridgeman was appointed keeper of the great &s;eal.</P>

<P>The parliament a&s;&s;embling in October, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, thanking him for having di&s;banded the forces which had been levied for the defence of the kingdom, when the Dutch fleet in&s;ulted the coa&s;ts; for having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all the papi&s;ts from his guards, and other military employ|ments; and in particular, for having taken the office of high chancellor from the earl of Clarendon. To this article he replied, that he would never employ him for the future in any public affair. He not only withdrew his protection from the earl, but even influenced the commons to impeach him of high trea|&s;on. They accu&s;ed him of having advi&s;ed the king to maintain an army, di&s;&s;olve the parliament, and render him&s;elf ab&s;olute: of having &s;aid the king was a papi&s;t: of having &s;old illegal patents, and granted injunctions to &s;top the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice of having bani&s;hed &s;everal per&s;ons in an unlawful manner: of having received bribes on different occa&s;ions, and enriched his family by obtaining grants for them of the crown-lands: of having fru&s;trated u&s;eful de&s;igns for the pre&s;ervation of Engli&s;h and the reduction of French colonies: of having corre&s;ponded with Oliver Cromwell and his accomplices: of having advi&s;ed and been in&s;trumental in the &s;ale of Dunkirk: of having altered a pa|tent after it had received the &s;anction of the great &s;eal: of having extorted money by writs of "Quo warranto" from many corporations, immediately after their charters had been confirmed by parliament: of having abu&s;ed and betrayed his maje&s;ty, by di&s;covering his &s;ecrets to the enemy: and of having advi&s;ed the fatal &s;eparation of the fleet, which in the late war had well nigh been attended with the lo&s;s of one part of his maje&s;ty's navy.</P>

This refu&s;al gave ri&s;e to a violent di&s;pute between the two hou&s;es. At length the commons voted that the lords, in refu&s;ing to commit the earl of Clarendon on their impeachment, had &s;topped the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, and formed a precedent of evil and dangerous con&s;equence. The earl knowing how ob|noxious he was to the commons, and con&s;cious that the court was determined on his ruin, $word$ to withdraw him&s;elf from the kingdom. The duke of York had &s;upported him with all his intere&s;t, both in the cabinet and the hou&s;e of peers. He had even entered &s;o warmly into his defence, as to give um|brage to the king, who at length de&s;ired him to tell the earl that he would do well to retire into another country; in which ca&s;e he might &s;till receive marks of his favour. It was in con&s;equence of this intimation that he cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to France, where he &s;pent the remainder of his life in reviewing and reducing to order the materials he had collected for the hi&s;tory of the great rebellion; a performance &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated for the candid repre&s;entation of facts, and the &s;triking touches of character which it contains.</P>

The lords having received this apology, deputed the duke of Buckingham to deliver it to the other hou&s;e; and when he performed this ta&s;k, <Q>&startq;Gentlemen, (&s;aid he) the lords have ordered me to put into your hands this &s;candalous and &s;editious libel &s;ent to them by the earl of Clarendon. I have orders to pre&s;ent it to your hou&s;e, and to de&s;ire you will &s;end it back with your convenience; for, as it is written in a &s;tyle very agreeable to their lord&s;hips, they are de&s;irous of pre&s;erving it carefully.&endq;</Q> The commons were incen&s;ed at this apology. Many virulent expre&s;&s;ions were uttered again&s;t the earl: they voted it a &s;can|dalous and malicious libel, and ordered it to be burned by the hands of the com|mon executioner. The lords &s;ent down to the commons, a bill for bani&s;hing the earl of Clarendon. The lower hou&s;e propo&s;ed a bill of attainder, and a warm di&s;pute en&s;ued. At la&s;t the lower hou&s;e pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t bill, to which the king gave his a&s;&s;ent with uncommon &s;atisfaction.

The Dutch were immediately expo&s;ed to his de&s;igns, from the nature of their &s;ituation, and wi&s;hed for nothing more than an op|portunity of uniting with England in a confederacy that &s;hould be able to op|po&s;e<NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 166$.</NOTE> a &s;ufficient barrier to the ambition of Lewis. The king of England find|ing his reputation and credit on the decline among his own &s;ubjects, was will|ing to take &s;ome &s;tep that might retrieve his popularity; and nothing was &s;o likely to produce this effect as his becoming the head of a league for &s;upporting the balance of power in Europe. He therefore di&s;patched Sir William Temple to the Hague, as amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary, will full power to conclude &s;uch a treaty with the &s;tates-general; and they received the overture &s;o favourably, that in five days the alliance was concluded. In a very little time, the king of Sweden acceded to it, as a principal, and thus was formed, "The triple alli|ance," by which the contracting powers a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves the office of arbiters in the differences between France and Spain, with re&s;pect to the Low-Countries, as well as in the war between Spain and Portugal. The de&s;ign of it was to &s;upport the Spani&s;h monarchy, re&s;train the exorbitant power of France, and prevent a dreadful war, in which all Europe would probably have been involved. It was therefore generally applauded, and &s;eemed to be in all re&s;pects the wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ure which was taken in England during the whole reign of Charles II. Sir William Temple afterwards concluded a treaty of commerce with the &s;tates-general; and a peace between Spain and Portugal was happily effected under the guaranty of the Engli&s;h monarch.</P>

<P>When the parliament met in February, the king informed them of the&s;e tran&s;actions, demanded a &s;peedy &s;upply for equipping a fleet, and forti|fying the maritime parts of the kingdom; and earne&s;tly de&s;ired they would deliberate upon ways and means for effecting an union with re&s;pect to religion among all his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects. The commons were &s;o offended at the king's lenity towards nonconformi&s;ts, that they did not even thank him for the triple alliance. On the contrary, they appointed a committee to examine the con|duct of &s;everal per&s;ons who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have mi&s;behaved in the late war. They enquired into the affair of Berghen in Norway, the &s;eparation of the fleet under prince Rupert and the duke of Albemarle; the pre&s;umption of Brouncker, in giving fal&s;e orders, while the duke of York was a&s;leep; the neglect of maintain|ing a &s;ufficient fleet, during the la&s;t year of the war; and the di&s;grace occa&s;ioned by the Dutch when they entered Chatham river. The king began to be ex|tremely unea&s;y at this &s;pirit of inquiry, which was rai&s;ed as a reproach upon the errors of his own admini&s;tration. He &s;ollicited them to di&s;cu&s;s the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the &s;upply.

<P>The triple alliance was founded upon an alternative which Lewis XIV. had propo&s;ed to the court of Spain. He offered to relinqui&s;h the rights of his queen, provided the court of Spain would either con&s;ent to his keep|ing the conque&s;ts he had already made in the Low-Countries; or, in lieu of the&s;e, cede to him Franche-Comt&eacute;, with the towns of Cambray, Aire, and St. Omer. The queen-regent of Spain had kept aloof, in hope of engaging the &s;tates-general and the king of England in a war again&s;t Lewis: but finding that the contracting powers of the triple alliance propo&s;ed only to take arms in ca&s;e the French king &s;hould recede from his alternative, &s;he con&s;ented to his keeping his acqui&s;itions in the Low-Countries, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the Engli&s;h and Dutch would be indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to engage in a war with France, &s;hould &s;he ever attempt to extend her conque&s;ts in the Netherlands. After this de|claration of Spain, no other ob&s;tacle remained to retard a pacification. Aix|la-Chapelle was the place pitched upon for the meeting of the plenipotentiaries, who were immediately &s;ent thither from France, Spain, England, Holland, and Sweden. The treaty was &s;igned in May, after a very &s;hort negotiation. Lewis remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the towns in Flanders, which he had reduced. He re&s;tored Franche-Comt&eacute; to the crown of Spain; and the peace was guaranteed by the powers concerned in the triple alliance. The Dutch ordered a medal to be &s;truck, with a pompous in&s;cription, in which they arrogated to them&s;elves the whole honour of having given peace to Europe. Jo&s;hua Van Beuningen, their plenipotentiary at Aix-la-Chapelle, was vain enough to &s;trike another, in which he compared him&s;elf to Jo&s;hua &s;topping the cour&s;e of the &s;un which was the device of the French monarch. The&s;e, and other &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable marks of pride, gave umbrage to Lewis, who &s;eemed to remember them in the &s;equel, when he found an opportunity to puni&s;h their pre&s;umption.

<P>HITHERTO, Charles &s;eems to have &s;tudied nothing &s;o much as his own ca&s;e and convenience. Without doubt, he inherited high no|tions of the prerogative, which were cheri&s;hed by the nature of his education. But, his father's fate and his own &s;ufferings had rendered him extremely cau|tious of quarelling with his parliament; and his indolent di&s;po&s;ition was an un&s;urmountable bar to the execution of any de&s;ign upon the liberties of the people. He had immer&s;ed him&s;elf in plea&s;ure, and would not have &s;acrificed his private enjoyment to the mo&s;t flattering pro&s;pect of arbitrary power, if his revenue had been &s;ufficient to &s;upply the channels of his prodigality. Though the commons were attached to him from principle, and had been liberal, if we compare their grants with tho&s;e of former parliaments; yet, con&s;idering the late increa&s;e of wealth and luxury in almo&s;t every court of Europe, his &s;upplies were rather &s;canty than a$$luent; and his profu&s;e expence rendered him a beg|garly dependent upon the bounty of the commons. His nece&s;&s;ities continually invaded his repo&s;e. He was ince&s;&s;antly importuned by &s;uitors whom he could not gratify. He was rou&s;ed by the more active &s;pirit of his brother, who ex|horted him to ri&s;e above tho&s;e humble &s;ollicitations he had hitherto practi&s;ed to his parliament for daily &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. He was be&s;et by &s;ome de&s;perate coun|&s;ellors, who importuned and encouraged him to affert his own independence in $ubduing that in&s;olent u&s;urpation which the rebellious &s;ubject had rai&s;ed on the ruins of regal authority. Prince Rupert, the duke of Ormond, lord-keeper Bridgeman, and &s;ecretary Trevor, men in who&s;e honour and integrity the na|tion had confidence, were now &s;eldom or never &s;ummoned to the cabinet|council; but, the king was wholly conducted by the advice of Clifford, A&s;hley, Buckingham, Arlington, and Lauderdale, a junto di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appella|tion of "The cabal," a word formed by the initial letters of their names. Sir Thomas Clifford was a man of an enterpri&s;ing genius, rendered the more dan|gerous by the talent of eloquence and the &s;pirit of intrigue which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Lord A&s;hley afterwards rai&s;ed to the $arldom of Shaft&s;bury, had been a mem|ber of the long-parliament, of great influence among the pre&s;byrerians: he in|$inuated him&s;elf into the confidence of Cromwell; and afterwards employed his credit in forwarding the re&s;toration. By his uncommon talents, he acquired great weight with every party he e&s;pou&s;ed. He was turbulent, re&s;tle&s;s, ambi|tious, &s;ubtle, and enterpri&s;ing: he had conquered all &s;en&s;e of &s;hame; was re|&s;trained by no fears, and influenced by no principle. The duke of Buckingham was a gay, capricious nobleman, of &s;ome wit, and great vivacity; the mini&s;ter of riot; the &s;lave of intemperance; a pretended athei&s;t, without honour, prin|ciple, ecconomy, or di&s;cretion. Arlington po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very moderate capacity, and was not remarkable for any vicious habit, though he wanted integrity and re&s;olution to with&s;tand the temptations of his colleagues. Lauderdale was learned, aukward, ob&s;tinate, ambitious, pa&s;&s;ionate even to frenzy, vindictive, implacable, in&s;olent, and abject. Such were the individuals that con&s;tituted the cabal; and the duke of York a&s;&s;i&s;ted at their councils. They repre&s;ented to the king, that even this parliament &s;o remarkably attached to the crown, had already exhibited &s;ome &s;ymptoms of di&s;content; that they had been penu|rious in their temporary &s;upplies, and kept his revenue in a very precarious &s;ituation. They ob&s;erved, that his father's great error con&s;i&s;ted in his having

<P>Colbert de Croi$&s;y, the French amba$&s;ador at London, had already &s;ounded the inclinations of the king and his cabal, touching an alliance with his ma$ter; and he $ound them very favourably di&s;po&s;ed, when he under&s;tood the de&s;ign of Lewis was to humble the pride of the &s;tates-general. After Colbert had thus paved the way for a negotiation, the king of France went to &s;ee his new works at Dunkirk; and was accompanied by the dutche&s;s of Orleans, who took this op|portunity of being in the neighbourhood of England to vi$it her brother Char$es. She l$nded in May at Dover, where &s;he was received by the king and all his court; and there they enjoyed each other's company for a fortnight, in a con|tinual round of diver&s;ions. She was one of the mo&s;t ami$ble prince&s;&s;es of the age in which &s;he lived, and loved her brother with the warme$$ a$$$ction; but, &s;he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been ve&s;ted with a private commi&s;&s;ion, to a$$ur$ Charles that the king of France would enable him to &s;hake off the yoke of parliament, and re&s;tore the catholic re$igion in England, as &s;oon as the Dutch &s;hould be &s;ufficiently humbled by their joint endeavours. If he retained any &s;cruples about the execution of this &s;cheme, Lewis could not have fixed upon more effectual expedients to remove them than tho&s;e he now practi&s;ed. The dutche&s;s of Orleans was a young lady of the mo&s;t in&s;inuating addr$$s, and had great influence with her brother: be&s;ides, the French king re&s;olved to bind him down to his engagements by the bonds of plea&s;ure. For thi$ purpo&s;e, he &s;ent over with the dutche$s, mademoi&s;elle de Quero&uuml;aille, a young lady of extraor|dinary beauty and accompli&s;hments, which in&s;tantly captivated the heart of Charles. She accompanied him to London, was crea$$d dutche&s;s of Port&s;|mouth, and maintained her empire over him during the whole cour&s;e of his life. She kept him firm to his connexions with France, and continued to be the reigning favourite, while his former mi&s;tre&s;s, lady Cleveland, was rai&s;ed to the dignity of dutche&s;s, as a recompence for the influence &s;he had lo$t.</P>

<P>The good under&s;tanding between the kings of France and England had well nigh been bla&s;ted in the bud, by an incident which made a deep im|pre&s;&s;ion on the mind of Charles. The dutche&s;s of Orleans, immediately after her return to France, happened to &s;wallow a gla&s;s of &s;uccory-water, by the di|rection of her phy&s;icians; and was immediately &s;eized with violent agonies, of which &s;he expired. She was &s;uppo&s;ed to have fallen a &s;acri$ice to the jea|lou&s;y
<PB N="436" REF="4380">
of her hu&s;band, who &s;eemed to take umbrage at the gaiety of her di&s;po|&s;ition, and intimacy of friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between her and his brother Lewis XIV. She certainly believed her&s;elf poi&s;oned; though &s;he was re&s;trained by her confe&s;&s;or from owning her &s;u&s;picion to Mr. Montague the Engli&s;h amba&s;|&s;ador in France, who was pre&s;ent at her death. She died with great re&s;olution, declaring &s;he felt no regret at leaving the world, but that of parting with her brother Charles, whom &s;he loved with the mo&s;t tender affection. When the news of this tragedy were brought to Whitehall by Sir Thomas Arm&s;trong, who, at the &s;ame time, communicated the &s;u&s;picion o$ her having been poi&s;oned, $he king melted in a flood of tears, and expre&s;&s;ed his indignation again&s;t the duke of Orleans, in the mo&s;t bitter terms of reproach. But, he &s;oon checked his pa&s;&s;$on, and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;Thomas, I beg you will not mention a &s;yllable of this matter.&endq;</Q> The court of France was in great confu&s;ion at this event. The report of the poi&s;on was immediately circulated through the city of Paris, and Lewis was afraid it would de&s;troy the connexion between him and the king of England. He &s;ent over the marquis de B$llefonds to condole with Charles; and this nobleman was furni&s;hed with the atte&s;tations of the phy&s;icians, who declared, that the dutche&s;s died of a natural di&s;temper. The king was, or pre|tended to be &s;atisfied with the&s;e te&s;timonies; and the duke of Buckingham, on pretence of carrying compliments of condolance to the duke of Orleans, was di&s;patched to France, with power to &s;ign the treaty which had been negotiated by the dutche&s;s.</P>

<P>Lewis, in the month of September, &s;ent the marechal de Crequi with a body of forces into Lorraine, of which he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The duke having been &s;urpri&s;ed, e&s;caped with difficulty, and implored the interce&s;&s;ion of Charles, whom he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his exile; but, the an&s;wer he received, was <Q>&startq;That there was no remedy like patience.&endq;</Q> The parliament meeting in October, the king, by the mouth of the lord-keeper, gave them to under&s;tand, that as the fleets of France and Holland were lately increa&s;ed to a very formidable degree, it was nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould maintain a re&s;pectable navy; and therefore he had ordered fifty large &s;hips to be put in commi&s;&s;ion, be&s;ides the &s;quadron al|ready in the Mediterranean: that even though he had not engaged to &s;uccour his allies in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, it would be very imprudent to &s;it aloof, and tamely $ee &s;o many clouds gathering, without providing &s;ome &s;helter again&s;t the im|pending &s;torm. He mentioned the treaties which had been lately concluded with the kings of France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, the &s;tates|general, and the duke of Savoy. He ob&s;erved, that the yearly expence of the fleet amounted to five hundred thou&s;and pounds: That the remaining part of the revenue was not &s;ufficient to pay the intere&s;t of the debts which the king had contracted: and, That the pre&s;ent armament would co&s;t eight hundred thou&s;and pounds. Finally, he a&s;&s;ured them, the king would prorogue the parliament at Chri&s;tmas; and de&s;ired they would regulate their mea&s;ures accordingly. The commons, dazzled by the great alliances the king had contracted for the honour and advantage of the nation, re&s;olved to gra|tify him in all his demands. They began to prepare bills for rai&s;ing two m$llions five h$$$red thou&s;and pounds; but, before they could be brought to per$ection, th$ king adjourned the parliament. By this time Sir William Temple, who re$$ded as amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, was recalled to London, the king and his mini&s;ters knowing he had too much integrity and love for his

country, to act as an in&s;trument of the cabal. At fir&s;t, he was ordered to leave his wife and family in Holland, as if the king intended he &s;hould return; but, De Wit was not a dupe to this artifice. He &s;u&s;pected the de&s;igns of the two monarchs; and de&s;ired the Dutch re&s;ident at London to inform the mini&s;try, that he would look upon Temple's being recalled as an infallible proof of a change of mea&s;ures at the court of England. In the preceding winter, the prince of Orange, being then twenty years of age, arrived at London, and was affectionately received by his uncle. His voyage was undertaken with a view<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Montague's Letters. Rapin.

<P>The commons, after a &s;hort adjournment, pa&s;&s;ed the Coventry-act, by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1671.</NOTE> which the practice of maiming was made a capital crime. This law derived its origin from an outrage committed upon a member of parliament. A propo&s;al having been made in the hou&s;e for laying a tax upon play-hou&s;es, it was oppo&s;ed by the courtiers, one of whom ob&s;erved, that the players were the king's &s;er|vants, and part of his plea&s;ure. Sir John Coventry a&s;ked, whether his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure lay among the male or the female players; and this &s;arca&s;m was con|&s;idered as an in&s;olent violation of that re&s;pect due to the kingly name, which had been hitherto religiou&s;ly pre&s;erved in all parliamentary di&s;putes. It was the more di&s;agreeable to Charles, as he then publicly maintained Gwyn and Davis, two concubines who had been cho&s;en from the theatre. The duke of Mon|mouth, therefore, undertook to make a public example of Coventry. This gen|tleman in going to his own lodgings at night, was attacked in the &s;treet by Sands, Obrian, and &s;ome other officers of the guards. He forthwith &s;natched a flambeau from his &s;ervant, with one hand, and managed his &s;word &s;o gallantly with the other, that he wounded three or four of the a&s;&s;ailants, before he was overpowered and di&s;armed: then his no&s;e was purpo&s;ely cut to the bone, as a le&s;&s;on to teach him what re&s;pect he owed to the king's character. The com|mons, exa&s;perated at this a&s;&s;ault upon a member for words &s;poken in the hou&s;e, not only enacted the law above-mentioned, but al&s;o in&s;erted a clau&s;e, importing, That tho&s;e who attacked Sir John Coventry &s;hould not be intitled to the be|nefit of a pardon from the crown. The lower hou&s;e, with the concurrence of the lords, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, on the progre&s;s of popery, repre|&s;enting the cau&s;e of its increa&s;e; and the means by which it might be re&s;trained for the future. Charles a&s;&s;ured them he would exert all his power for their &s;atisfaction; but &s;aid, they could not think it &s;trange, that he &s;hould make &s;ome di&s;tinction between the papi&s;ts who had lately embraced the catholic religion, and tho&s;e who had not only been born and educated in that per&s;ua&s;ion, but al&s;o faithfully &s;erved his father and him in their adver&s;ity. The commons then pro|ceeded upon the &s;upplies: they brought in a bill for a land-tax, another for an additional exci&s;e upon beer, and a third for taxing law-&s;uits for a certain number of years. The king had for &s;ome time made a practice of going to the hou&s;e of peers, without formality, on pretence of hearing the debates for his amu&s;ement, though his real de&s;ign was to influence their deliberations.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; VI.</HEAD>
<P>When the fir&s;t of the bills &s;ent up by the commons was read in the upper hou&s;e, lord Lucas ro&s;e up, and, in the king's hearing, pronounced a &s;evere &s;peech, complaining, that &s;ince the re&s;toration, the burthens laid upon the &s;ubject were much more grievous than at any former time, while the &s;trength of the kingdom had vi&s;ibly dimini&s;hed; that great &s;ums granted to the king had been employed to enrich a few individuals, who had kept aloof from him in the day of trouble; while tho&s;e who had &s;uffered the heat of the day, undergoing impri&s;onments, &s;eque&s;trations, and expo&s;ing their lives for his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, were reduced to poverty and contempt. He &s;aid the nation was in &s;ome re&s;pects more mi&s;erable than if it were actually &s;ubdued by a victo|rious enemy; for, in that ca&s;e, the people would know the wor&s;t of their mi&s;|fortune, a circum&s;tance that would in &s;ome mea&s;ure alleviate their affliction: but at pre&s;ent the &s;ubject was kept in the mo&s;t perplexing uncertainty, in giving to-day, they did not know but that they &s;hould be obliged to give twice as much to-morrow, until they &s;hould be entirely exhau&s;ted. It would be nece&s;&s;ary therefore to make &s;ome &s;ort of e&s;timation, to a&s;certain what every man might call his own: for his own part, &s;hould it be found nece&s;&s;ary, he would con|&s;ent to give one half of his &s;ub&s;tance to the king, provided he could be &s;e|cured in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the remainder. He added, that the bills brought in by the commons would rai&s;e three millions; an enormous &s;ub&s;idy. He there|fore propo&s;ed, that the lords &s;hould moderate the exce&s;&s;ive liberality of the lower hou&s;e, by reducing the rate of the land-tax; for, if they had not power to retrench the extravagance of &s;uch impo&s;itions, they might &s;ay they had nothing; and that their whole &s;ub&s;tance was at the di&s;po&s;al of the commons. This bold &s;peech, which was printed and publi&s;hed, gave &s;uch umbrage to the king, that, in con&s;equence of his reque&s;t, the peers ordered it to be burned by the hands of the hangman, as a libel upon lord Lucas; becau&s;e, when the paper was pre&s;ented to him, and he was que&s;tioned about it, he owned part of it only. Neverthele&s;s it had made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon the lords, who &s;ent back the bill with amendments. The&s;e were rejected by the commons, and a di&s;pute en&s;ued; but at la&s;t the lords &s;ubmitted, and the bills were pa&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>The lords agreed likewi&s;e to the tax upon law-proceedings: but they refu&s;ed to pa&s;s a fourth for laying an additional duty on certain commodities. The merchants of London petitioned again&s;t it, as an in&s;upportable burthen on trade; and the upper hou&s;e propo&s;ed amendments. The commons affirmed that the lords had no right to amend money-bills; the&s;e denied the a&s;&s;ertion. The di&s;pute grew warm. The commons claimed the &s;ole right of regulating the taxes, by virtue of a fundamental law. The lords de&s;ired them to pro|duce that law; and they an&s;wered, they would find it on the back of the "Magna Charta." The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive conferences &s;erved only to inflame their mutual animo&s;ity, which became &s;o violent that the king found it nece&s;&s;ary to prorogue the parliament; and, for a year and nine months, it was kept from rea&s;&s;embling, by means of repeated prorogations.</P>

The dutche&s;s had, during her la&s;t illne&s;s, embraced the Roman catholic religion; and, &s;oon after her
<PB N="439" REF="4410">
death, the duke made a &s;olemn abjuration of the prote&s;tant here&s;y, to father Simons, an Engli&s;h je&s;uit. He had been convicted during his exile, and was generally known to be a catholic in his heart, though hitherto he had not made open profe&s;&s;ion of his religious principles; on the contrary, he pre|tended to adhere to the church of England. The king had long entertained the de&s;ign of procuring a divorce from Catherine, in hope of having legitti|mate i&s;&s;ue by another con&s;ort. Buckingham had propo&s;ed infamous means for ruining her reputation, in &s;uch a manner that &s;he might have been charged with breach of conjugal faith; but, the&s;e expedients the king rejected with horror. He believed the marriage might be declared null, on account of her being barren, or incapable of bearing children; and the pope was &s;ounded on this &s;ubject. The je&s;uits in England knowing of what con&s;equence &s;uch a divorce might be to the duke of York, pre&s;&s;ed him to declare his religion, threatening, that unle&s;s he would make that &s;acrifice to his con&s;cience, they would u&s;e all their influence to procure the pope's con&s;ent to the king's di|vorce from Catherine. The duke for &s;ome time refu&s;ed to take a &s;tep which he knew would render him odious to the greater part of the Engli&s;h nation; but finding the je&s;uits were actually employed in putting the&s;e threats in execu|tion, he agreed to make a formal abjuration of the prote&s;tant religion, on con|dition that they would ob&s;truct the divorce.</P>

<P>The immediate views of the cabal at this juncture were directed to a war with Holland; it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to break the triple alliance, and find a pretext for beginning ho&s;tilities. Sir Henry Coventry was di&s;patched as amba&s;&s;ador to Sweden; and Sir George Downing &s;ent to the Hague, in the room of Sir William Temple. De Wit knew this mini&s;ter to be a turbulent firebrand, and an inveterate enemy to the republic; he therefore con&s;idered the change as an infallible &s;ign of an approaching rupture. Downing, at his arrival in Holland, &s;olemnly prote&s;ted that his ma&s;ter was determined to ad|here &s;crupulou&s;ly to the triple alliance; and that he had no other rea&s;on for equipping a fleet, but that of rendering him&s;elf re&s;pectable among his neigh|bours, and guarding again&s;t the de&s;igns of the French king, whom he had great rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t. At the &s;ame time he complained of the backwardne&s;s of the Dutch, in fulfilling the article of the la&s;t treaty relating to Surinam; and mentioned &s;ome cau&s;es of difference between the Engli&s;h merchants and their Ea&s;t-India company. The captain of a yacht &s;ent to bring over the wife and family of Sir William Temple from the Hague, was ordered by the ad|miralty to go in que&s;t of the Dutch fleet, and fire upon them &s;hould they re|fu&s;e to pay the compliment to the flag of England. This officer did not fall in with them until lady Temple and her children were on board: then he &s;ailed through the mid&s;t of a &s;quadron commanded by Van Ghent; and, as they did not lower their top&s;ails, di&s;charged his cannon at them without he&s;i|tation. The Dutch admiral, &s;urpri&s;ed at this extravagance, &s;ent an officer to expo&s;tulate with him upon &s;uch extraordinary conduct. He replied, that he acted according to orders. Then Van Ghent going on board of his yacht, on pretence of paying his compliments to lady Temple, told him, that although the &s;tates-general had engaged by treaty to pay the compliment to the Engli&s;h flag, he could not expect that a large fleet, commanded by an admiral, would lower their top&s;ails to a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el, which was not even a &s;hip of war,
<PB N="$40" REF="4420">
but a private boat for plea&s;ure or di&s;patch. The captain departed without further di&s;putes; yet, though he had fired &s;everal guns loaded with &s;hot at them, and been &s;aluted by the Dutch admiral, he no &s;ooner arrived in England, then he was committed pri&s;oner to the Tower, for not having &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;erted the ho|nour of his maje&s;ty.

<P>How far Charles re&s;pected his honour at home, we may learn by an incident of a &s;ingular nature, that occurred about this period. There was a de&s;perate ruffian, of the name of Blood, rendered infamous by the practice of robbery and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. He had undertaken to &s;urpri&s;e the ca&s;tle of Dub|lin, while the duke of Ormond was viceroy of Ireland: but he failed in the attempt, and &s;ome of his accomplices being hanged, he &s;wore their death &s;hould be revenged. He followed the duke into England; and, one night while that nobleman was in his coach returning to Clarendon-hou&s;e where he lodged, Blood, with eight accomplices well mounted, &s;topped the carriage. He murdered the coachman and one of the &s;ervants, then &s;et the duke on hor&s;e|back, behind one of the gang, that he might be conveyed to Tyburn, and put to an ignominious death, purpo&s;ing to leave his body hanging on the gib|bet, with a paper fixed to his brea&s;t, explaining the cau&s;e of his execution. They had already made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in this expedition, when the duke, making an effort to di&s;engage him&s;elf, fell from the hor&s;e, together with the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to whom he had been tied: while they lay &s;truggling together on the ground, Ormond's dome&s;tics, who had been by this time alarmed, rode up to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and Blood with his crew having di&s;charged their pi&s;tols at the duke, e&s;caped by favour of the darkne&s;s. He afterwards formed a &s;cheme for carrying off the regalia from the Tower of London; and executed it &s;o far, that he had actually &s;eized the crown, and pa&s;&s;ed out at the Tower-gate, with three accomplices, after having left Edwards, the keeper of the Jewel|office, &s;eemingly dead of the wounds he received in defending his tru&s;t. Neverthele&s;s, he alarmed the guards, and the ruffians were apprehended. One of them was immediately known to have been concerned in the attempt upon Ormond, which was now laid to the charge of Blood; and he frankly owned him&s;elf author of that enterprize, but he refu&s;ed to di&s;cover his accomplices, &s;aying, the fear of death &s;hould never prompt him to deny a crime, or betray an a&s;&s;ociate. This de&s;perado, who had been a &s;oldier in Cromwell's army, behaved with &s;uch remarkable intrepidity and contempt of life, that the king was &s;eized with an emotion of curio&s;ity to &s;ee &s;uch a phenomenon; and Blood knew how to turn this circum&s;tance to his advantage. He told his maje&s;ty, that on account of the &s;everity which had been exerci&s;ed over the con&s;ciences of the godly, he had once re&s;olved to kill the king with a carbine, in a place near Batter&s;ea, where Charles u&s;ed to bathe in the river: that with this view he had actually concealed him&s;elf among the reeds; but his &s;pirits were &s;o damped with the awe of maje&s;ty, that he relented, and laid a&s;ide his de&s;ign. He &s;aid he looked upon life and death with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute indif|ference; but gave the king to under&s;tand, that his a&s;&s;ociates had bound them|&s;elves together, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths, to revenge the death of any indivi|dual of the confederacy, that might fall into the hands of ju&s;tice; and that no power upon earth could baffe the efforts of their de&s;perate re&s;olution. The

king, though he affected admiration at this man's boldne&s;s, was in all proba|bility alarmed with the fear of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and on that motive pardoned the malefactor; though not before he had obtained the con&s;ent of Ormond, who granted it in the mo&s;t gallant manner.

Nothing retarded the commencement of ho&s;tilities, but the indigence of Charles: though he had received two millions five hundred thou&s;and pounds from parliament, and &s;even hundred thou&s;and livres by &s;tipulation from the king of France, he &s;till found him&s;elf in nece&s;&s;ity. He gave his mini&s;try to under&s;tand, that he could not begin the war without a further &s;upply of five hundred thou&s;and pounds; and, as he could not have recour&s;e to the parliament, which was prorogued, he promi&s;ed to confer the office of trea&s;urer upon him who &s;hould contrive a practicable expedient for rai&s;ing that &s;um of money. Sir Thomas Clifford happened to be the mo&s;t for|tunate in his invention: he propo&s;ed to &s;top the payments of the exchequer, and convert all the money to his immediate occa&s;ions. The &s;cheme was im|mediately put in execution, and Clifford appointed lord-trea&s;urer. The whole nation was a&s;toni&s;hed and affrighted at this de&s;perate mea&s;ure. The bankers, who had lent money to the government, &s;hut up their &s;hops, and refu&s;ed to accept the draughts of tho&s;e who kept ca&s;h with them; &s;o that many private families were ruined. The merchants could neither an&s;wer bills, nor pay duties at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e; &s;o that commerce was interrupted, credit in a great mea&s;ure de&s;troyed, the public faith violated, univer&s;al confu&s;ion en&s;ued among the trading part of the nation, and the city of London was filled with clamour and di&s;traction. The king publi&s;hed a declaration, excu&s;ing this &s;tep as the effect of nece&s;&s;ity, ari&s;ing from the formidable preparations of his neighbours, and promi&s;ing to do ju&s;tice to the creditors of the crown. Finding very little regard was payed to his proclamation, he convened the bankers at the Trea&s;ury, and a&s;&s;ured them from his own mouth, that they &s;hould be punc|tually &s;atisfied, either from the next &s;upplies granted by parliament, or out of his own revenue: he therefore de&s;ired they would an&s;wer the draughts of the merchants, &s;o that bu&s;ine&s;s might flow in its former channel.</P>

<P>The cabal had devi&s;ed another plan for filling the king's coffers; namely, that of intercepting the Dutch fleet of merchant &s;hips from Smyrna, valued at fifteen hundred thou&s;and pounds. Sir Robert Holmes was &s;ent on this &s;ervice, and fell in with Sprague, on his return with a &s;quadron from the
<PB N="442" REF="4440">
Mediterranean: had he been reinforced by this officer, he would certainly have &s;ucceeded in his de&s;ign; but he was re&s;olved to engro&s;s the whole honour and advantage to him&s;elf, and allowed Sprague to continue his voyage homewards. He &s;oon de&s;cried the Dutch fleet, under convoy of five &s;hips of war, com|manded by commodore Van Ne&s;s, who had received &s;ome intimation of his de&s;ign, and put his &s;quadron, with the convoy, into an admirable po&s;ture of defence. Holmes attacked them with great impetuo&s;ity, on the thirteenth day of March; and all that day they bravely &s;u&s;tained the engagement: it was re|newed in the morning, and maintained till night; on the third day, one of the Dutch &s;hips of war was taken, together with three or four incon&s;iderable trading ve&s;&s;els: the re&s;t continued their cour&s;e, under the excellent conduct of their com|modore; and, by the favour of a thick fog, arrived &s;afely in Holland. The &s;tates-general exclaimed loudly again&s;t this pyratical attempt, which appeared the more di&s;honourable, as it had proved un&s;ucce&s;sful; the people of Eng|land condemned it as an infamous enterprize, and the king him&s;elf was a&s;hamed of the undertaking. The mini&s;try pretended that it was no other than a ca&s;ual rencounter, occa&s;ioned by the pride of the Dutch commodore, who refu&s;ed to &s;trike his top&s;ails in compliment to the Engli&s;h &s;quadron. Neverthele&s;s, four Dutch Ea&s;t-India &s;hips, afterwards taken by the Engli&s;h cruizers, were condemned as lawful prize, even before the declaration of the war.</P>

<P>The &s;tates-general could hardly believe the king of England was in earne&s;t, until the&s;e outrages were committed; then they were convinced, and redoubled their diligence in preparing for a rupture between the two nations. In the mean time Charles, with a view to favour the Roman catholics, by virtue of his &s;upreme power in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, confirmed by divers acts of parliament, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, &s;u&s;pending the penal laws again&s;t nonconfor|mi&s;ts, indulging prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters with the public exerci&s;e of their religion, and allowing the catholics to wor&s;hip God after their own way in private. This was a large &s;tride towards arbitrary power, &s;o contrary to the &s;entiments of the parliament, that he would not have ventured to take it, had not he been provided with a powerful fleet, and a new$rai&s;ed army, at his devotion. His next &s;tep was to declare war again&s;t the Dutch, for having refu&s;ed to &s;end home the Engli&s;h families &s;ettled in Surinam, as the two nations had &s;tipu|lated in the treaty of Breda; for having denied the honours due to the Engli&s;h flag; and ridiculed the king and people of England in medals and pictures: &s;uch were the frivolous pretences of this iniquitous war. The Dutch ju&s;tified them&s;elves, by affirming that they had not detained the Engli&s;h families in Surinam, but they had refu&s;ed to quit the colony; that their admirals were not obliged, by any treaty, to lower their top&s;ails on their own coa&s;t to an Engli&s;h plea&s;ure-boat; and that they had never countenanced any pictures or medals that reflected upon the honour of the king or people of England <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The foundation of this ridic$lo$s charge was a portrait of Cornel$$$ De Wit, the pen&s;ionary's brother, p$$nted by order of the magi&s;trates of Dort.

Charles, to complete the farce, pretended, in this declaration, that he would &s;till faithfully adhere to the purport of the triple alliance. Mean while he or|dered

all the Dutch &s;hips that were in Engli&s;h harbours to be &s;eized, contrary to an expre&s;s article in the treaty of Breda. The Dutch followed his ex|ample; but afterwards relea&s;ed them, ob&s;erving that his breach of faith was not a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for their imitating &s;uch unju&s;tifiable conduct. After &s;uch an uncommon in&s;tance of candour and integrity, Charles was a&s;hamed to detain their ve&s;&s;els, the greater part of which were &s;et at liberty. He now, by a &s;tretch of prerogative, &s;u&s;pended the art of navigation, as almo&s;t all the &s;eamen in the kingdom were employed in the navy. He i&s;&s;ued a proclamation in favour of pre&s;&s;ing &s;ailors: in another he threatened all tho&s;e who &s;hould pre&s;ume to &s;peak irreverently of his conduct, or hear &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es without informing again&s;t the delinquents; and, by an order of council, he e&s;tabli&s;hed martial law for the regulation of the army. The lord keeper Bridgeman re|fu&s;ing to affix the &s;eal to the declaration for &s;u&s;pending the penal laws, was removed from his office, and lord A&s;hley, now earl of Shafte&s;bury, was ap|pointed lord chancellor of England.</P>

<P>Lewis XIV. in his declaration of war again&s;t the Dutch, a&s;&s;igned no other rea&s;on than his being di&s;&s;atisfied with their conduct. The bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter declared war again&s;t the republic, on pretence of their having at|tempted to corrupt the governors of his places; and the elector of Cologne admitted a body of French troops into his dominions, under the pretext of providing for his own &s;afety, though De Wit was well appri&s;ed of the treaty in which he had engaged. The commonwealth of the United Provinces &s;eemed now devoted to de&s;truction. Lewis was at the head of an army, con|&s;i&s;ting of one hundred and eighty thou&s;and men, commanded by the be&s;t ge|nerals in the world: his &s;ubjects were enriched by commerce, under the ex|cellent admini&s;tration of Colbert; and his finances were managed with admi|rable oeconomy. The Dutch, on the other hand, were di&s;tracted between two powerful factions. De Wit, the chief of the Louve&s;tein party, who had long directed the admini&s;tration, thought he could not take more effectual means to depre&s;s the Orange faction, than tho&s;e of di&s;banding great part of the army, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the old officers who were devoted to the family of Orange, and &s;upplying their places with the &s;ons and kin&s;men of his own friends, ge|nerally raw youths, who had never &s;een &s;ervice, were utterly ignorant of di&s;|cipline, and, for the mo&s;t part, &s;erved by proxy; &s;o that no military &s;pirit remained. The &s;oldiers were de&s;pi&s;ed; the fortifications neglected; and all the valour and di&s;cipline of the republic confined to the navy, which was the ob|ject of the pen&s;ionary's peculiar care and in&s;pection. The &s;tates-general at fir&s;t endeavoured to divert the king of England from his ho&s;tile intentions, by conce&s;&s;ions and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. They con&s;ented to honour his flag in any manner he &s;hould pre&s;cribe; and they appointed his nephew the prince of Orange captain-general and admiral, though he had not yet attained the twenty-third year of his age: but Charles rejected all their advances; he was bent upon the de&s;truction of the republic, without paying the lea&s;t regard to the intere&s;t of his nephew.</P>

<P>De Wit had not acted with his u&s;ual vigilance, in making prepara|tions for the threatened inva&s;ion. He was now &s;en&s;ible of the extreme hazard to which his country was expo&s;ed; and re&s;olved to make one powerful effort by &s;ea, while the prince of Orange was employed in making levies, and re|e&s;tabli&s;hing

di&s;cipline in the army. De R$yter was &s;ent to &s;ea with a fleet of ninety &s;hips of war, be&s;$des forty frigates and fire&s;hips, and Cornelius de Wit acted on board as deputy from the &s;tates. Their intention was to prevent the junction of the French and Engli&s;h fleets; but this was already effected. They lay at anchor in Solebay, to the number of one hundred and thirty &s;hips of the l$ne. The duke of York commanded in chief; the earl of Sandwich acted as $dmiral of the blue; and the French &s;quadron was conducted by the marechal d'Etr$es. They rode at anchor in &s;uch di&s;order, that the earl of Sandwich repre|&s;ented to the duke the danger of their being attacked in that po&s;ture; but his advice was neglected, and the an&s;wer he received was &s;uch as implied a &s;u&s;picion of his courage. Picued at this reflection, he re&s;olved, in ca&s;e of an engagement, to conquer or peri&s;h. On the twenty-eighth day of May, the Dutch admiral bore down upon them &s;o &s;uddenly, that they were obliged to cut thei$ cables with the utmo&s;t precipitation, in order to form the line; and the whole $$eet was in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that the &s;hips ran foul of one another. The earl of Sandwich made ha&s;te to weather the headland, and oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to the enemy, that the duke might have time to reduce the re&s;t of the fleet into order. He &s;u&s;tained a mo&s;t furious attack from the brave&s;t of the enemy. He repul&s;ed the &s;hip of Van Ghent, after that admiral had been killed in the engagement: he de&s;troyed another large &s;hip which attempted to board him; he &s;unk three fire&s;hips before they were near enough to grapple with his rigging. Though &s;ix hundred of his men were either killed or wounded, and his &s;hip was dreadfully &s;hattered by the &s;hot of the enemy, he &s;till continued to ply his artillery without cea&s;ing, until another fire&s;hip ran him aboard on the quarter. Even then he might have e&s;caped into another ve&s;&s;el; but the duke's &s;arca&s;m had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind, that he cho&s;e rather to die than &s;urvive the lo&s;s of his &s;hip, which, being blown up, he and every per&s;on on board were de&s;troyed. In the mean time the duke of York was attacked by De Ruyter; and they engaged each other &s;o clo&s;e for two hours, that the Dutch admiral afterwards declared this was the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate of two and thirty actions in which he had been concerned. The duke's &s;hip being di&s;abled, he was obliged to move his flag on board of another, and his divi&s;ion was in danger of being overpowered; when Sir Jo&s;eph Jordan, who &s;ucceeded Sandwich, came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The battle being thus re&s;tored, continued till night, when the Dutch retired. Victory declared for neither &s;ide, though it was claimed by both nations. The French &s;quadron was very little engaged; and, in all pro|bability, the marechal d'Etr&eacute;es had orders to keep off, that the two maritime powers might de&s;troy one another.</P>

<P>Lewis had by this time invaded the territories of the &s;tates-general on the &s;ide of Germany. He pa&s;&s;ed the Meu&s;e at Vi&s;et, reduced Or&s;oi, Bur$k, We&s;el, Emerick, and Rhinberg, almo&s;t without oppo&s;ition. Then he ad|vanced to the banks of the Rhine, which his hor&s;e pa&s;&s;ed by &s;wimming, while his infantry cro&s;&s;ed it in boats; and a few Dutch regiments that appeared on the oth$r &s;ide, retired with precipitation. Marechal de Turenne took the &s;trong fort of Skink in a few days; Arnheim, Knotzembourg, and Nime|guen, &s;urren$ered to him at the fir&s;t &s;ummons. Lewis entered Doerbourg w$thout re$$&s;tance: his forces reduced Harderwick, Amersfert, Campen, Rh$nen, Viane, Eiberg, Zwol, Cuilemberg, Wageninguen, Lochem, and

The marquis of Rochefort &s;urprized Naerden, within three leagues of Am&s;terdam. Fourteen &s;tragglers appearing before Muyden, re|ceived the keys of the town from the magi&s;trates; but the ca&s;tle was pre&s;erved by a female &s;ervant, who rai&s;ed up the draw-bridge, and the French &s;tragglers were afterwards expelled: the cannon of this fortre&s;s commands the entrance to the harbour of Am&s;terdam. The prince of Orange, at the head of his raw, di&s;couraged troops, was obliged to retreat into the province of Holland before the victorious enemy, who&s;e rapid progre&s;s overwhelmed the people with con|&s;ternation and de&s;pair. Lewis had now &s;ubdued the three provinces of Guel|derland, Overy&s;&s;el, and Utrecht, and threatened the re&s;t with immediate &s;ub|jection. The populace, and all tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ed the Louve&s;tein party, in&s;tead of exerting them&s;elves for the pre&s;ervation of their liberties, exclaimed again&s;t the pen&s;ionary, for having neglected the means of defence. They re|viled him as the partizan of France; the author of all their calamities; and looked upon the young prince of Orange as the only per&s;on who could &s;ave them from de&s;truction. In the mid&s;t of this de&s;pondence, the magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam acted up to the noble example of their ance&s;tors: they obliged the burge&s;&s;es to keep watch and ward; the people were armed and regularly payed; &s;ome u&s;ele&s;s &s;hips were repaired, and furni&s;hed with artillery for the defence of the city; and the &s;luices being opened, the whole neighbourhood was laid under water. The other towns followed their example; &s;o that the whole province of Holland was overflowed.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions, the nobles were &s;till &s;o much influenced by their fears, that when the &s;tates met to deliberate upon the de|plorable &s;ituation of the commonwealth, they voted that, provided their reli|gion, liberty, and &s;overeign power, could be &s;aved, every thing el&s;e &s;hould be &s;urrendered to the conqueror. Am&s;terdam declared again&s;t treating with the foe; but this oppo&s;ition being over-ruled, they &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to depre|cate the wrath, and implore the compa&s;&s;ion of the French and Engli&s;h mo|narchs. They offered to cede Mae&s;tricht, and all the frontier towns lying without the limits of the &s;even provinces, to Lewis, and accommodate him with a large &s;um to defray the expence of the war. The French king de|manded that the commodities of France &s;hould be imported duty free into Holland; that the &s;tates would permit the free exerci&s;e of the catholic reli|gion, &s;hare the churches between them and the prote&s;tants, and appoint re|gular &s;alaries for their prie&s;ts; that they &s;hould cede to him all the frontier towns of the republic, together with Nimeguen, Skink, Knotzembourg, part of Guelderland, the i&s;les of Bommel and Voorn, and the forts of St. Andrew, Louve&s;tein, and Crevecoeur; that they &s;hould pay twenty millions of livres for the expence of the war; &s;end a yearly emba&s;&s;y to Paris, with a golden medal, as an acknowledgment that to him they owed the pre&s;ervation of that liberty which his predece&s;&s;ors had enabled their &s;tates to acquire; that they &s;hould give entire &s;atisfaction to the king of England; and, within ten days, &s;ignify their a&s;&s;ent to the&s;e propo&s;als: in which ca&s;e he would evacuate his conque&s;ts.</P>

<P>Their envoys di&s;patched to London met with a very har&s;h reception from the court, though they excited the compa&s;&s;ion of the people. Charles him&s;elf began to be unea&s;y at the rapid progre&s;s of his ally. He fore&s;aw that the entire conque&s;t of Holland would be a formidable acce&s;&s;ion of power to Lewis, who might forget his engagements, and think it his intere&s;t to leave the king of England in dependence upon his &s;ubjects: be&s;ides, he was eager to &s;hare the &s;poils of the Dutch republic. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their amba&s;&s;adors, and &s;ent the duke of Buckingham, with the earls of Arlington and Hallifax, to ne|gotiate with Lewis on the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs. They repaired to Utrecht, where the French king re&s;ided with his court, renewed the league between him and Charles, and in&s;erted a clau&s;e, that no peace &s;hould be made with Holland, but by common con&s;ent. Then they produced their ma&s;ter's demands upon the &s;tates, importing, that the Dutch &s;hould do honour to the Engli&s;h flag, without any limitation; bani&s;h all the king's enemies and calumniators; pay a million &s;terling towards the charges of the war, as well as ten thou&s;and pounds yearly for liberty to fi&s;h on the Briti&s;h &s;eas; &s;hare the trade of the Ea&s;t Indies; inve&s;t the prince of Orange with the hereditary dignity of &s;tadt|holder; and deliver into the king's hands the i&s;les of Walcheren, Cad&s;ant, Gor&eacute;e and Voorn, together with the town and ca&s;tle of Sluys, as &s;ecurity for the performance of articles.</P>

<P>The&s;e cruel demands reduced the people of Holland to de&s;pair. The Orange faction took this opportunity to inflame their re&s;entment again&s;t the pen&s;ionary and his brother, who became the objects of popular hatred and exe|cration. They demanded the repeal of the perpetual edict, by which they had engaged upon oath, that they would never acknowledge the prince of Orange as &s;tadtholder. The two brothers &s;till continued to oppo&s;e the repeal, from mo|tives of true patrioti&s;m. At length the populace broke through all re&s;traint. By an in&s;urrection at Dort the burgoma&s;ters were compelled to &s;ign a repeal of the edict. The people at Am&s;terdam, Rotterdam, Middleburg, and the Hague, ro&s;e in arms again&s;t their magi&s;trates, and obliged them to declare in favour of the prince of Orange. John De Wit had been a&s;&s;aulted, and left &s;eemingly dead upon the &s;treet; his brother Cornelius was be&s;et by ruffians in his own hou&s;e at Dort; and, being &s;ick, was with great difficulty protected by his &s;ervants: the gallant De Ruyter was in&s;ulted in the &s;ame manner at Am|&s;terdam. Cornelius de Wit was accu&s;ed by an infamous barber of a de&s;ign again&s;t the life of the prince of Orange. Though the charge was improbable and ab&s;urd, the multitude howled for ju&s;tice; and his judges, intimidated by their clamour, condemned him to the torture. This he endured with un&s;haken fortitude, prote&s;ting his innocence; and, between whiles, repeating the beau|tiful ode of Horace, beginning with "Ju&s;tum et tenacem propo&s;ite virum." He was, neverthele&s;s, deprived of his offices, and underwent the &s;entence of bani&s;hment. The pen&s;ionary re&s;olved to accompany him in his exile, and re|paired to the pri&s;on where he lay, in order to con&s;ole him in his adver&s;ity. The ba&s;e-born multitude a&s;&s;embled in a tumultuous manner, broke down the pri&s;on|doors, dragged out the unfortunate brothers, embrued theit &s;avage hands in the blood of tho&s;e virtuous patriots who had de&s;erved &s;o well of their country, and treated their dead bodies with the mo&s;t barbarous indignity.</P>

<P>By the unworthy fate of tho&s;e two &s;ons of liberty, the prince of Orange acquired the whole admini&s;tration of Holland and Zealand: the young prince, John Ca&s;imer, of Na&s;&s;au, now under the guardian&s;hip of his mother, was &s;tadtholder of Friezeland and Groningen; and the other three provinces were in the hands of the enemy. Lewis no &s;ooner under&s;tood that the prince of Orange was elevated to the dignity of &s;tadtholder, than he at|tempted to bribe him over to his intere&s;t, by offering to make him &s;overeign of Holland; but he rejected the propo&s;al with di&s;dain. The duke of Bucking|ham, vi&s;iting this young prince on his return to England from Utrecht, ex|horted him to put him&s;elf wholly under the protection of his uncle, the king of England. When he expre&s;&s;ed a regard for his country, the duke &s;aid, <Q>&startq;You &s;ee your country is already lo&s;t.&endq;</Q> <Q>&startq;There is one way (replied the prince) of avoiding &s;uch a &s;ight; and that is, to die in the la&s;t ditch.&endq;</Q> The &s;tadt|holder was naturally phlegmatic, re&s;erved, and thoughtful, well acquainted with the &s;trength and intere&s;t of his country. To the care of John De Wit, the profe&s;&s;ed enemy of his greatne&s;s, he owed a liberal education: he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great &s;hare of courage and fortitude, and was extremely tenacious of his pur|po&s;e. At an extraordinary a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, he, in a &s;peech that la&s;ted three hours, repre&s;ented the pernicious con&s;equences of accepting the terms pro|po&s;ed by the king of France; encouraged them with &s;olid rea&s;ons to hope that they &s;hould &s;till be able to defend their liberties; demon&s;trated the po&s;&s;ibility of rai&s;ing money to defray the enormous expence of &s;uch a war; and concluded with &s;aying, that religion and liberty could not be purcha&s;ed at too dear a price. The &s;tates li&s;tened to him with amazement: they were a&s;toni&s;hed at the ex|tent of his knowledge, and the &s;olidity of his arguments: they were animated by the &s;pirit of their young &s;tadtholder. That grief and dejection, which had &s;o long appeared in their countenances, now vani&s;hed; they recovered the faculty of recollection, which &s;eemed to have been buried under their misfor|tunes; and began to exert them&s;elves with vigour in defence of their country.</P>

<P>Lewis, &s;eeing a &s;top put to his conque&s;ts by the inundation of Hol|land, left the duke of Luxemburgh at Utrecht, and marched into Flanders, from whence he ha&s;tened to Paris, where he was received with more ful&s;ome adulation than had ever been payed to any European prince &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of the Roman empire. The pa&s;&s;age of the Rhine, which he had beheld at a wary di&s;tance, and which his troops had performed almo&s;t without oppo&s;ition, was celebrated in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, as an exploit equal to that of Alexander in pa&s;&s;ing the Granicus; and the epithet of "Great" was be&s;towed upon him by the &s;ervile flattery of his &s;ubjects, though he had not the lea&s;t ingredient of heroi&s;m in his whole compo&s;ition. He was on this occa&s;ion accompanied by the duke of Monmouth, who commanded &s;ix thou&s;and Engli&s;h auxiliaries, that rein|forced Lewis in con&s;equence of the treaty between the two monarchs.

<P>The chief hope of the Dutch centered in the Engli&s;h parliament, which they believed would open its eyes to the real intere&s;t of the kingdom, and take mea&s;ures for putting an end to a war &s;o oppo&s;ite to the advantage of their country: but, in this hope, they were di&s;appointed by another proro|gation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">B$rnet. Temple. Rap$n.</NOTE> Charles, re&s;olving to make new levies, thought proper to keep the exchequer &s;till &s;hut; though the time was elap&s;ed, at the expiration of which he had faithfully promi&s;ed it &s;hould be opened. He excu&s;ed him&s;elf, however, in a proclamation, ob&s;erving, that the war &s;till continued, though he had done all that lay in his power, to promote a pacification. Sir Henry Coventry was now appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate; lord Clifford rewarded with the trea&s;urer's &s;taff, and the dignity of duke conferred upon Lauderdale; &s;o that the cabal &s;eemed to triumph in their councils, and &s;ecurely enjoyed their pen&s;ions from France, the infamous wages of treachery and corruption. At length the parlia|ment<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 16$$.</NOTE> rea&s;&s;embled in the beginning of February; and, at the recommendation of the court, cho&s;e Sir John Charleton their &s;peaker, Turner, who hitherto po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the chair, having been created a baron of the exchequer. The king, in his &s;peech, having mentioned the war, and referred them to the declaration for the cau&s;es and nece&s;&s;ity of that mea&s;ure, ob&s;erved that his indulgence in favour of the nonconformi&s;ts had produced a very good effect, in &s;ecuring the peace of the kingdom. He &s;aid, the favour granted to catholics was as little as he could &s;hew, con&s;idering their &s;ervices and fidelity to him and his father: he told them plainly, that he &s;hould take all &s;orts of contradiction in evil part, and was determined to &s;upport his declaration on that &s;ubject. He took notice of a &s;u&s;|picion he had incurred, of having levied land-forces to controul the laws and invade the property of the &s;ubject: he declared there was a nece&s;&s;ity for having a greater number for the next campaign; therefore he hoped they would take that circum&s;tance into con&s;ideration. He concluded with an a&s;&s;urance that he would maintain the true prote&s;tant religion as e&s;tabli&s;hed in the church of Eng|land; and that the liberty and property of his &s;ubjects &s;hould be pre&s;erved inviolate. The earl of Shafte&s;bury, as lord chancellor, enlarged upon the &s;ame &s;ubjects, in a long &s;peech replete with the mo&s;t impudent fal&s;hoods, the mo&s;t palpable ab&s;urdity, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t adulation. He a&s;&s;erted that this was the parliament's war, undertaken by their advice again&s;t an in&s;olent people, who aimed at univer&s;al empire; a nation who&s;e exi&s;tence was incompatiable with the intere&s;t of Great-Britain; <Q>&startq;they mu&s;t be exterminated (&s;aid he) "Delenda e&s;t Carthago. If you &s;uffer them to ri&s;e again, remember that the &s;tates of Holland are the perpetual enemies of England, both from intere&s;t and incli|nation.&endq;</Q> He extolled the king as the be&s;t prince that ever &s;at upon the throne; as the re&s;torer of liberty and the Engli&s;h church, for which his father had &s;uffered; in which he him&s;elf had been born and educated; and to which he had adhered in his greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous attachment, notwith&s;tanding the great offers by which he was tempted to renounce his reli|gion. He recommended a &s;upply to their &s;erious con&s;ideration, de&s;iring that it might be &s;peedy and effectual. He concluded with the&s;e words, <Q>&startq;Let us ble&s;s God and the king, that our religion is &s;afe; that the church is committed to the care of a prince, from whom we have nothing to fear for our parliaments,
<PB N="449" REF="4510">
liberties, and property. What more can a good Engli&s;hman a&s;k, except that God will be plea&s;ed to grant his maje&s;ty a long and happy reign; and that the triple alliance between king, parliament, and people, may never be broken or impaired.&endq;</Q> The commons, in&s;tead of complying with the mea&s;ures of the king, began the &s;e&s;&s;ion by vindicating their own privileges. The chancellor had i&s;&s;ued writs for filling the vacant &s;eats in parliament, and new members had been elected; but now the hou&s;e voted tho&s;e writs and elections illegal, and the new members were expelled. The commons were extremely di&s;&s;atisfied with the king's conduct: they di&s;approved of the war, and re&s;olved to demand that the grievances of the nation &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed: but that they might not be &s;u&s;pected of di&s;affection or un&s;ea&s;onable re&s;entment, they voted a tax of &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds per month for eighteen months, to an&s;wer the king's extraordinary occa&s;ions. But they did not even mention the war, and re&s;olved that the money-bill &s;hould go hand in hand with the redre&s;s of grievances. They pre&s;ented an addre&s;s again&s;t the king's declaration for liberty of con&s;cience, ob&s;erving that the penal laws could not be &s;u&s;pended but by act of parliament; and be&s;eeching his maje&s;ty to remove all doubts and fears from the hearts of his faithful &s;ubjects. He an&s;wered, that he was &s;orry a &s;tep he had taken for the peace of the kingdom &s;hould produce any unea&s;ine&s;s in the hou&s;e of commons, or give them cau&s;e to call in que&s;tion his undoubted power in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, which he &s;hould never have thought of u&s;ing, but for the advantage of his &s;ubjects. He declared his intention was not to evade or renounce the advice of his parliament; and, that if they would pre|pare a bill for the &s;ame purpo&s;es, that &s;hould be more effectual for pre&s;erving the tranquillity of church and &s;tate, and pre&s;ent it in a &s;uitable manner, he would convince them of his readine&s;s to concur with every mea&s;ure that &s;hould be judged nece&s;&s;ary for the benefit of the kingdom. In another addre&s;s, the commons gave him to under&s;tand, that his an&s;wer was not &s;ufficient to remove their fears and &s;u&s;picions, ari&s;ing from his arrogating a power of di&s;pen&s;ing with penal laws: a power, which they &s;aid his predece&s;&s;ors had never pretended to exerci&s;e: a claim, by which he might interrupt the cour&s;e of the laws, and change the whole legi&s;lative power, re&s;iding in the king and the two hou&s;es of parliament; they therefore implored a more clear and &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. He replied, it was an affair of con&s;equence, and he would take time to con&s;ider their addre&s;s. Charleton, the &s;peaker, de&s;iring to re&s;ign the chair on account of his ill &s;tate of health, was &s;ucceeded by Edward Seymour.</P>

<P>The cabal had mi&s;reckoned on the intere&s;t of the pre&s;byterians, which they thought to &s;ecure by the declaration of indulgence. That &s;ect perceived the drift of the court was, under &s;helter of them, to favour the Roman catholics; that the mini&s;try pur&s;ued arbitrary mea&s;ures; that the king had involved the nation in an unju&s;t and expen&s;ive war with their natural al|lies, and a&s;&s;embled an army, which was encamped in the neighbourhood of London, in all probability to over-awe the deliberations of the parliament. Alderman Love, one of the chiefs of the pre&s;byterian party, &s;poke in the hou&s;e with great &s;pirit again&s;t the declaration; and his di&s;intere&s;ted behaviour on this occa&s;ion made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ion on the commons, that they brought in a bill for the relief of prote&s;tant nonconformi&s;ts. It pa&s;&s;ed the lower hou&s;e without oppo&s;ition; but the lords propo&s;ed &s;ome amendments, with which the com|mons
<PB N="450" REF="4520">
would not comply; and, before the affair could be compromi&s;ed, the king prorogued the parliament. In the mean time, the lords and commons joined in an addre&s;s again&s;t the Roman catholics, de&s;iring that the laws might be rigorou&s;ly executed again&s;t prie&s;ts and je&s;uits: that all officers and per&s;ons in public employments in the army, &s;hould take the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy, and receive the communion according to the form of the church of England. He publi&s;hed a proclamation according to cu&s;tom; but this did not &s;atisfy the commons, who re&s;olved to prepare a bill that &s;hould ef|fectually remedy the evil of which they complained; and they were determined again&s;t pa&s;&s;ing the &s;upplies until the declaration for liberty of con&s;cience &s;hould be recalled.</P>

<P>Charles now found his affairs at a very delicate cri&s;is: the que&s;|tion was, whether he &s;hould pull off the ma&s;k, and break with his parlia|ment, or &s;acrifice his prerogative, and own him&s;elf dependent upon their power and affection. The cabal were divided in opinion. The majority advi&s;ed him to &s;hake off all re&s;traint, and avail him&s;elf of the army which lay encamped on Black-heath, under the command of Schomberg, a German prote&s;tant, of great reputation in war. Lauderdale undertook to bring a &s;trong body of forces from Scotland, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;ubduing the parliament. Buckingham offered to &s;eize tho&s;e members of the lower hou&s;e who oppo&s;ed the court-mea&s;ures. The &s;ame violent councils were e&s;pou&s;ed by Shaft&s;bury and Clifford: but Ar|lington, from a timorous temper, was for more moderate mea&s;ures. The French king exhorted Charles to make peace with the parliament, as he could not of him&s;elf maintain the whole war. The concubines, afraid of &s;uffering in the general confu&s;ion that would en&s;ue, importuned him to embrace pacific mea&s;ures; and this conduct being the be&s;t &s;uited to his own indolent and un|warlike di&s;po&s;ition, he re&s;olved to gratify the commons. Shaft&s;bury, per|ceiving the king's want of re&s;olution, began to dread a parliamentary inquiry; from the danger of which, that he might &s;kreen him&s;elf in time, he, in the mo&s;t abrupt manner, entered into all the violence of the oppo&s;ition. He was received with open arms, by the chiefs of tho&s;e who were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the Country Party: they knew his &s;trength, and triumphed in the acqui&s;ition. He now pre&s;&s;ed the king to a compliance with the parliament; and Charles, &s;ending for the declaration, broke the &s;eal with his own hand. On the eighth day of March, he repaired to the hou&s;e of peers, where he de|&s;ired the commons to di&s;patch the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;upply; and a&s;&s;ured them, that he would grant his a&s;&s;ent to every bill calculated to redre&s;s their grie|vances.</P>

<P>The two hou&s;es were &s;o well plea&s;ed with this a&s;&s;urance, that they went in a body to thank his maje&s;ty for his mo&s;t gracious declaration. Never|thele&s;s, they &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed the famous te&s;t-act, importing, That every per&s;on in office or employment, &s;hould take the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy; receive the &s;acrament in &s;ome pari&s;h-church before competent witne&s;&s;es, and &s;ub&s;cribe a declaration, renouncing all belief of the real pre&s;ence in the eu|chari&s;t. They likewi&s;e brought in another bill for preventing marriages be|tween prote&s;tants and papi&s;ts: this was levelled again&s;t a match now in agita|tion between the duke of York and the archdutche&s;s of In&s;pruck. Then the commons pre&s;ented two addre&s;&s;es upon grievances; one relating to England,
<PB N="451" REF="4530">
and the other to Ireland. In the fir&s;t, they demanded that a new duty laid upon coals, by order of council, &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; that &s;oldiers &s;hould not be quartered in private hou&s;es; that the forces &s;hould be di&s;banded at the conclu&s;ion of the war; and that the practice of pre&s;&s;ing men into the &s;ervice &s;hould be di&s;continued. The petition concerning Ir$land related chiefly to re|ligious grievances; but, among other articles, they reque&s;ted that colonel Richard Talbot, agent for the catholics in that kingdom, &s;hould be dive&s;ted of all employment, civil or military, and be denied acce&s;s to his maje&s;ty's per&s;on. The king made a favourable an&s;wer; and then the money-bill pa&s;&s;ed without oppo&s;ition. When the te&s;t-act received the royal a&s;&s;ent, a bill of in|demnity likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed to &s;kreen the mini&s;ters from all inquiry: then the ca|tholic officers quitted their employments; the duke of York re&s;igned the lu|crative office of lord high admiral; and lord Clifford gave up his trea&s;urer's &s;taff, which was be&s;towed upon Sir Thomas O&s;borne, afterwards$ created earl of Danby.</P>

<P>Prince Rupert being appointed admiral of the fleet, began to make preparations for going to &s;ea, but was thwarted by his captains, who were generally devoted to the duke, and re&s;ented his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion: Sir Edward Sprague and the earl of O$$ory acted as inferior admirals. Having been joined by the French &s;quadron under D'Etr&eacute;es, they &s;teered towards the coa&s;t of Holland, to the number of one hundred and forty &s;ail, comprehending fri|gates and fire&s;hips, and, on the twenty-eighth day of May, attacked the Dutch fleet, under De Ruyter, near Schoenvelt; but neither &s;ide had cau&s;e to boa&s;t of the victory. The enemy retired into their own harbours, and u&s;ed &s;uch diligence in re&s;itting their &s;hips, that in a week they again pre&s;ented them|&s;elves to the combined fleets of England and France. On the fourteenth of June, they met off Flu&s;hing, where they cannonaded one another without coming to a clo&s;e engagement, and were parted by tempe&s;tuous weather before any con&s;iderable damage was done on either &s;ide. Prince Rupert was aver&s;e to the war, and for that rea&s;on perhaps acted with the le&s;s activity. The duke &s;till influenced the conduct of the admiralty; and, from private pique to prince Rupert, kept the fleet in continual want of nece&s;&s;aries and provi&s;ion; &s;o that he was obliged to return into harbour to be &s;upplied. He was no &s;ooner in condition to go to &s;ea, than he &s;teered his cour&s;e to the Texel; and, on the eleventh day of Augu&s;t, fell in with the Dutch fleet, commanded by De Ruyter and Tromp, who were now perfectly reconciled by the mediation of the prince of Orange. When the action began, De Ruyter &s;ingled out prince Rupert; Tromp oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to Sir Edward Sprague; and Brankert, their rear$admiral, bore up to the marechal D'Etr&eacute;es. This battle was fought with &s;ur|pri&s;ing emulation by the Engli&s;h and Dutch officers; but the French kept a$loof, in &s;uch a manner, that Brankert &s;hot a-head to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of De Ruyter; and prince Rupert, being &s;eparated from the divi&s;ion of Sir John Chichely, was quite &s;urrounded by the enemy, and expo&s;ed to a mo&s;t dreadful fire. He &s;ought with his u&s;ual courage, and manife&s;ted &s;uch conduct as he had never di&s;played before. He di&s;engaged him&s;elf with wonderful dexterity; and, joining Chichely, bore down to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Sprague, who was almo&s;t overpowered by Tromp and his &s;quadron. The Royal Prince, in which he fought, was &s;hattered in &s;uch a manner, that he was obliged to &s;hift his flag
<PB N="452" REF="4540">
to the St. George; Tromp for the &s;ame rea&s;on moved from the Golden Lion to the Co$et; and the action was renewed with redoubled violence, until the St. George was quite di&s;abled: then Sprague took to his boat, in order to hoi&s;t his flag on board of another &s;hip; but the pinnace being &s;unk by a cannon-ball$ this gallant officer peri&s;hed. The earl of O&s;$ory di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his extr$ordinary valour and pe$&s;everance; but, after the death of Sprague, he found him&s;$lf hard pre&s;&s;ed by the enemy. Prince Rupert perceiving that whole divi&s;ion almo&s;t tot$$ly di&s;abled, &s;ent three fire&s;hips among the Dutch fleet, which was l$kewi$$ greatly damaged; and made &s;ignal for the French &s;quadron to bear down and engage. Had they obeyed this order, while the enemy were in confu&s;ion, occa&s;ioned by the fire&s;hips, in all probability the Engli&s;h would have obtained a complete victory. But the French marechal payed no regard to the &s;ignal; and the majority of the Engli&s;h &s;hips had been &s;o roughly handled, that the prince could not pur&s;ue his advantage: he therefore col|lected his &s;traggled &s;hips, and hauled off to the Engli&s;h &s;hore, leaving the vic|tory undecided.</P>

<P>The king of Sweden having offered his mediation, a congre&s;s was opened at Cologn; but the two monarchs in&s;i&s;ted nearly on the terms which they had already impo&s;ed, and the &s;tates having recollected them&s;elves from their panic, &s;unk every day in their offers, as their affairs began to a&s;&s;ume a more favourable a&s;pect. Spain and France had come to an open rupture: the emperor had declared in their favour, and &s;ent an army into the field, under the command of the famous Montecuculi, who found means to baffle the vigi|lance of Turenne, and, by a &s;udden march, inve&s;ted Bonne on the Upper Rhine, before the marechal was aware of his de&s;ign. The prince of Orange having taken Naerdin, and, by the mo&s;t artful conduct, left all the French ge|nerals behind him, joined the Imperiali&s;ts, and Bonne &s;urrendered in a few days. They reduced &s;everal other places in the electorate of Cologn; and the com|munication between France and the United Provinces being cut off, Lewis abandoned all his conque&s;ts, except Mae&s;tricht, which he had taken during this campaign. The Dutch amba&s;&s;adors at the congre&s;s now talked in very lofty terms; and tho&s;e of France and England retired from Cologn, on pretence of the violence offered to the count de Fur&s;tenberg, plenipotentiary for the elector of Cologn. This nobleman was apprehended by order of the emperor, as a &s;ubject of the empire, who had betrayed his country; and the two kings refu&s;ed to treat until he &s;hould be &s;et at liberty.</P>

<P>The emperor, in another in&s;tance, manife&s;ted his contempt for the king of England and his concerns. Propo&s;als had been made for a mar|riage between the duke of York and a prince&s;s of the In&s;pruck branch of the hou&s;e of Au&s;t$$$: but the emperor becoming a widower in the cour&s;e of this year, e&s;pou&s;ed the lady; and the duke of York was obliged to turn his eyes to another quarter. He now pitched upon Mary, &s;i&s;ter of Francis duke of Modena, whom Lewis XIV. declared an adopted daughter of $rance; en|gaging at the &s;ame time to pay her portion. The propo&s;al was immediately accepted, and the marriage &s;olemnized by proxy; the earl of Peterborough re|pre&s;enting the duke's per&s;on. The commons meeting after a prorogation, petinoned the king that he would prevent the match between the duke and the prince&s;s of Modena; and take c$re that his brother &s;hould marry no lady of the
<PB N="453" REF="4550">
catholic per&s;ua&s;ion. To this addre&s;s the king replied, that the duke's marriage was already con&s;ummated by proxy; and that he could not &s;uppo&s;e it would be di&s;agreeable to the commons, as they had never expre&s;&s;ed the lea&s;t di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction at the propo&s;al of the other match between his brother and a catholic prince&s;s, which had been &s;o long in agitation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The hou&s;e was not &s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, and re&s;olved to pre&s;ent another addre&s;s, containing their rea&s;ons for oppo&s;ing the marriage. Charles, in a &s;peech to parliament, had mentioned the congre&s;s at Cologn; giving them to under&s;tand, that his amba&s;&s;adors had been treated with con|tempt by tho&s;e of the &s;tates-general, who &s;eemed aver&s;e to all rea&s;onable terms of accommodation. He therefore demanded a &s;peedy &s;upply for the maintenance of the war; de&s;ired they would di&s;charge the debt he had con|tracted with the bankers and gold&s;miths, who were ruined by his &s;topping payment at the exchequer; and he promi&s;ed to maintain the religion, liberty and property of his &s;ubjects. The chancellor expatiated upon the &s;ame topics; but neither his eloquence, nor the king's importunity, made the lea&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion upon the commons. They adjourned the hou&s;e, and afterwards began to take his maje&s;ty's &s;peech into con&s;ideration. In a committee of the whole hou&s;e, they re&s;olved, That no &s;upply &s;hould be granted to the king, nor any impo&s;ition laid upon the &s;ubjects, before the final payment of the la&s;t aid, amounting to one million two hundred and thirty-eight thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty pounds; nor until the kingdom &s;hould be &s;ecured again&s;t the de&s;igns of popery, and all the national grievances redre&s;&s;ed; unle&s;s the ob&s;tinacy of the Dutch, in refu&s;ing rea&s;onable terms of peace, &s;hould render &s;uch &s;upply nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of the nation. At the &s;ame time, they petitioned for a general fa&s;t, as if the kingdom had been in imminent danger. Then the hou&s;e went in a body to the king, with a &s;econd addre&s;s again&s;t the duke's marriage. They repre&s;ented that it would produce doubts, di&s;quiets, and di&s;|&s;atisfaction in the minds of the people, and probably engage his maje&s;ty in alliances prejudicial to the prote&s;tant religion; that it would increa&s;e the number of prie&s;ts and je&s;uits in England, and revive the hopes of the catholic party; that it would dimini&s;h the people's affection for his royal highne&s;s; that the prince&s;s of Modena having &s;o many relations at the court of Rome, this marriage would furni&s;h them with means to penetrate into his maje&s;ty's mo&s;t &s;ecret councils; and, as matches concluded by proxy, had been often di&s;&s;olved, they intreated him to prevent the actual con&s;ummation of this marriage, the duke being the pre&s;umptive heir of the crown.</P>

<P>Charles was extremely &s;hocked at the&s;e vigorous proceedings of the commons, and told them, he would con&s;ider their addre&s;s. Mean while they voted that the land army was a grievance and a burthen to the nation; and began to prepare a third addre&s;s on that &s;ubject On the fourth day of November, the king came &s;uddenly to the upper hou&s;e, and &s;ent for the com|mons. The u&s;her of the black rod and the &s;peaker arrived at the &s;ame time at the hou&s;e of commons; but the fir&s;t had no &s;ooner entered, than the door was &s;hut upon the u&s;her. Then the commons immediately voted, That the al|liance with France was a grievance; that the evil coun&s;ellors about the king were grievances; and that, in particular, the duke of Lauderdale was a grie|vance,

Mean while the u&s;her continued knocking at the door; the &s;peaker leaped from the chair before the votes could be collected, and the hou&s;e ro&s;e in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. The king, in a very &s;hort &s;peech, repre&s;ented the great advantages which the enemy would reap from the lea&s;t appearance of di&s;&s;en&s;ion between him and his parliament: he declared he had exerted his ut|mo&s;t care in preventing the growth of popery; and prorogued them to the &s;eventh day of January. He deprived the earl of Shaft&s;bury of his office, and Sir Heneage Finch was created keeper of the great &s;eal. He removed all<NOTE PLACE="marg">B$rn$$. Rapin. Ralph.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A$. Ch. 1674.</NOTE> When the parliament re-a&s;&s;embled, the king told them, that the &s;tates general &s;ought only to amu&s;e him with vague overtures of peace: that their &s;ole hope centered in a di&s;union between him and his parliament; that the be&s;t way of obtaining a good peace was to equip a good fleet; that a good fleet could not be equipped without money; and that therefore he expected a &s;peedy and proportionable &s;upply, granted with good will and affection. Charles had now lo&s;t all credit with his parliament: they were aware of his dangerous de&s;igns; they re&s;olved to prevent the execution of tho&s;e plans of arbitrary power which he had projected; and &s;eriou&s;ly deliberated on the grievances of the nation. The lords, in an addre&s;s, petitioned that all papi&s;ts might be or|dered to quit London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, during the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament; and he publi&s;hed a proclamation for that purpo&s;e. Next day the two hou&s;es joined in another addre&s;s, de&s;iring he would ordain a day of fa&s;ting and hu|miliation, to implore the protection of God again&s;t the efforts of popery; and the king complied with their reque&s;t. The commons pre&s;ented a third addre&s;s, de&s;iring that the militia of London, We&s;tmin&s;ter, and the whole kingdom, might be ready at an hour's warning, to oppo&s;e any in&s;urrections that might be excited by papi&s;ts or other malcontents. The king a&s;&s;ured them that he would provide for the &s;afety of their lives, liberties, and privileges. They voted, That the king &s;hould be intreated to remove the duke of Lauderdale for ever from his per&s;on and council, as a dangerous and &s;u&s;pected per&s;on. The duke of Buckingham under&s;tanding that he would be the next victim, de&s;ired and obtained a hearing before the hou&s;e. On the fir&s;t day he was &s;o di&s;ordered, that he pretended to be taken ill, and withdrew. At his &s;econd appearance, he &s;eemed more compo&s;ed. He endeavoured to ju&s;tify his own conduct; imputed all the evil coun&s;els to the earl of Arlington, and dropped &s;ome &s;evere in&s;inua|tions again&s;t the king and his brother <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He &s;aid $$nting was a good diver&s;ion; but if a man would hunt with a brace of lob$$ers, he would have but ill &s;port.

The commons de&s;ired he would an&s;wer a &s;et of queries, which they prepared, in relation to &s;ome arbitrary &s;teps of the government; but they were not &s;atisfied either with his an&s;wers or defence, and therefore he underwent the fate of Lauderdale. Arlington was likewi&s;e heard in his own ju&s;tification, and excu&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o well, that, although an impeachment was prepared again&s;t him, they dropped the pro&s;ecution.</P>

<P>Charles now perceiving that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to maintain the war which was &s;o di&s;agreeable to the parliament, began to li&s;ten to the terms which the &s;tates-general had propo&s;ed to him in private for a &s;eparate peace. They wrote a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letter, to be delivered by the marquis de Fre&s;no, the Spani&s;h envoy at London, whom they impowered to conclude a treaty with him in their name, on certain conditions &s;pecified in his credentials. Charles, to make a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, communicated tho&s;e propo&s;als to the two hou&s;es; and demanded the advice of his parliament. They exhorted him to put an end to the war: the conferences were begun with the marquis de Fre&s;no; and in fifteen days the treaty was concluded. It was a renewal of the peace of Breda, with the&s;e additions, That they &s;hould compliment the Engli&s;h flag whether in large fleets or in &s;ingle ve&s;&s;els; and pay about three hundred thou&s;and pounds to Charles, towards defraying the expence of his armaments.</P>

<P>Though the parliament thanked the king for this peace, which was extremely agreeable to the nation, they &s;till continued to examine grievances. They in&s;i&s;ted upon the king's di&s;banding his land-forces and guards: they ap|pointed a committee to con&s;ider the militia-law pa&s;&s;ed in the Scotti&s;h parliament, authori&s;ing the army of that kingdom to march into any part of the king's dominions, by an order of their council. Another committee was directed to inquire into the &s;tate of Ireland, with re&s;pect to religion, the regular troops, and the militia. They prepared one bill for explaining and maintaining the pri|vilege of the Habeas corpus; and brought in another, obliging the members of both hou&s;es to take the te&s;t-oath. Charles was not a little mortified at this &s;pirit of &s;everity; but he rendered the&s;e mea&s;ures ineffectual by an immediate pro|rogation; and having thus freed him&s;elf from all foreign and dome&s;tic di&s;putes, relap&s;ed into a life of indolence, effeminacy, and plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>The king of France expre&s;&s;ed no re&s;entment at his being aban|doned in this clande&s;tine manner by his ally: on the contrary, he frankly ac|cepted the profered mediation of Charles, from which he had rea&s;on to hope for favour and indulgence, con&s;idering that he, at this time, obliged the Engli&s;h monarch with a yearly pen&s;ion of one hundred thou&s;and pounds. Be&s;ides, the &s;ucce&s;s of the war had not been an&s;werable to the &s;anguine hopes of Lewis; and his enemies had multiplied into a formidable alliance. The prince of Orange had advanced into Flanders with a numerous army well di&s;ciplined, and endea|voured to bring the prince of Cond&eacute; to a battle; but, he cautiou&s;ly avoided an engagement, becau&s;e he was inferior in number, till at length the &s;tadtholder expo&s;ed a wing of his army at Seneffe. The French general did not fail to take advantage of this over&s;ight; and a very ob&s;tinate action en&s;ued. The prince of Orange behaved on this occa&s;ion with equal courage and pre&s;ence of mind. He rallied his troops, and led them back to the charge. He attacked the veteran forces of France with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;pirit and per&s;everance; and obliged the prince of Cond&eacute; to exert all the qualities of a con&s;ummate general. The battle was maintained even by moon-light, till at la&s;t the darkne&s;s parted the combatants. The prince of Cond&eacute; &s;aid, the &s;tadtholder had acted in every thing like an old general, except in expo&s;ing his per&s;on too much like a young &s;oldier. He then undertook the &s;iege of Oudenarde; but, at the enemy's ap|proach he abandoned the enterprize, by the per&s;ua&s;ion of the Imperial and Spa|ni&s;h generals with whom he was joined: but, he inve&s;ted and took Grave be|fore

the end of the campaign. The French had reconquered Franche Comt&eacute;; and Turenne was &s;uperior to the allies in Al&s;ace. He defeated the duke of Lorrain, and the emperor's general Caprara, at Zintzheim. The Germans had invaded Al&s;ace to the number of &s;eventy thou&s;and. He attacked and routed a body of them at Mulhau&s;en: he drove the elector of Brandenburgh from Colmar: he obtained a victory over them at Turkheim: and at la&s;t, ob|l$ged them to repa&s;s the Rhine with damage and di&s;grace.</P>

<P>The king of England, that his propo&s;als of mediation might have the more weight with the &s;tates-general, recalled Sir William Temple from his $etreat, and &s;ent him amba&s;&s;ador to Holland, where he knew that mini&s;ter was in univer&s;al e&s;teem. He found the Dutch very well di&s;po&s;ed to peace; but, they could not in gratitude de&s;ert their allies, who in&s;i&s;ted upon pro&s;ecuting the war; and the prince of Orange was by this time inflamed with the de&s;ire of military glory. During the campaign he carefully avoided all conference with the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador; and afterwards told him, that until a greater impre&s;&s;ion could be made upon France, they had nothing to expect from a negotiation. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This year was remarkable for the death of $span$ m$n; namely, M$$$on, one of the gre$$ed $word$ for $word$ poetry th$$ ever the world produced; and the earl of Clarendon, who died in the eighth year of $is exile, at Rouen in Normandy.</NOTE></P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions the court of England underwent &s;ome al$$rations.

This con|te&s;t produced the mo&s;t rancorous animo&s;ity between tho&s;e two mini&s;ters, who mutually exerted their utmo&s;t endeavours for the ruin of each other. The duke of Buckingham was di&s;graced, and lo&s;t the dignity of chancellor of the uni|ver&s;ity of Cambridge, in which he was &s;ucceeded by the duke of Monmouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Ralph.

Lauderdale &s;till kept his ground by the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous application to the king's pa&s;&s;ions; and the mo&s;t devoted &s;ub&s;erviency to all his extravagant de&s;igns. Neverthele&s;s, he was &s;o much intimidated by the vote which had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him in the hou&s;e of commons, that he affected openly to renounce the mea&s;ures of the cabal. He profe&s;&s;ed uncommon zeal for the prote&s;tant religion; appeared con&s;tantly at church; was punctual in receiving the com|munion; and advi&s;ed the king to put the laws rigorou&s;ly in execution again&s;t the catholics.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 16$5.</NOTE> All the&s;e arts, however, were incapable of appea&s;ing the re&s;ent|ment of the commons.

As Charles did not think proper to comply with their reque&s;t, they re&s;olved to deliver another petition to the king, for the

Then they &s;et on foot an inquiry into the conduct of the earl of Danby, whom they re&s;olved to impeach, for having been concerned in a de|&s;ign to render the king ab&s;olute; but, finding the proofs in&s;ufficient, they dropped the accu&s;ation. The next &s;tep they took, was an addre&s;s to his ma|je&s;ty, de&s;iring he would recal the Engli&s;h auxiliaries from France; and take effectual methods to prevent his &s;ubjects from engaging in that &s;ervice for the future.

<P>The commons proceeded with &s;uch warmth in tho&s;e maxims of oppo&s;ition to the court, that many members of the upper hou&s;e, and e&s;pe|cially the bi&s;hops, began to dread the revival of the republican &s;pirit. In order to prevent the mi&s;chiefs which might be kindled by &s;uch a flame, the earl of Lind&s;ey brought into the hou&s;e of lords a te&s;t-bill, for impo&s;ing upon all per|&s;ons in eccle&s;ia&s;tical, civil, and military employments, as well as upon privy|coun&s;ellors, and members of parliament, an oath, renouncing the lawfulne&s;s of re&s;i&s;ting the king, or tho&s;e acting under his commi&s;&s;ion, on any precence what|&s;oever; and declaring before God, that they would never attempt to alter the government in church or &s;tate. This bill met with &s;uch oppo&s;ition, that the debates upon it continued &s;eventeen days; and then it was carried by a &s;mall majority.

<P>It would in all probability have produced warmer di&s;putes and more bitter altercation among the commons, had not their attention been di|verted by a conte&s;t of another nature. One doctor Shirley having been ca&s;t in a law&s;uit by Sir John Fag a member of the hou&s;e of commons, appealed from chancery to the hou&s;e of peers, who took cognizance of the cau&s;e, and &s;ummoned Sir John Fag as re&s;pondent. He complained to the lower hou&s;e, which undertook to defend him. They declared, that the lords had no right to receive an appeal from any court of equity; and committed Shirley to pri&s;on. The peers in&s;i&s;ted upon their juri&s;diction, which they had exerci&s;ed for a long cour&s;e of years. Recour&s;e was had to conferences, which proved ineffectual. The commons impri&s;oned four lawyers who pleaded in this cau&s;e before the peers, contrary to an order of the lower hou&s;e. The lords declared this com|mitment a breach of the Magna Charta; and ordered the lieutenant of the Tower to relea&s;e the pri&s;oners. Upon his refu&s;al, they petitioned his maje&s;ty to puni&s;h him for contempt of the hou&s;e. The king, in a &s;peech to both hou&s;es, exhorted them to lay a&s;ide their animo&s;ity; and finding his advice had no effect upon the commons, prorogued the parliament to the thirteenth day of October. The lower hou&s;e had voted a &s;upply of three hundred thou&s;and pounds to the king; but, at the &s;ame time, re&s;olved that the tonnage and poundage &s;hould be applied to the maintenance of the navy: he was therefore not a little chagri$ed to &s;ee the bill delayed by the quarrel between the two hou&s;es.</P>

<P>In opening the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, he earne&s;tly recommended unanimity, the intere&s;ts of the Engli&s;h church, and a &s;upply that &s;hould be &s;ufficient for building new &s;hips, and clearing off the anticipations of his revenue. The commons ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed to pay his debts; but they granted three hundred thou&s;and pounds for the expence of building twenty &s;hips of a certain rate; and appropriated the
<PB N="458" REF="4600">
tonnage and poundage to the &s;upport of the navy. Then they began to re&s;ume the &s;ubject of grievances with great eagerne&s;s and acrimony; when their deliberations were interrupted by the in&s;olence of a French je&s;uit called father St. Germain. He entered the hou&s;e of one Luzancy, a convert to the prote&s;tant religion; and by threatening to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate or tran&s;port him to France, extorted a writing, in which he renounced his conver&s;ion. A complaint of this violence was brought before the commons by Luzancy, who declared, that the je&s;uit had &s;aid the king was a catholic in his heart: that the court was endeavouring to procure liberty of con&s;cience: and, that in le&s;s than two years the majority of the Engli&s;h people would acknowledge the pope's authority. Luzancy charged him with having dropped &s;ome other expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame nature; and added, there was &s;uch a number of prie&s;ts and papi&s;ts in London, that a pro&s;el$te could not walk in the &s;treets, without running the ri&s;que of his life. This affair produced &s;uch a violent ferment among the commons, that the king, in order to appea&s;e them, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, offering a reward of two hundred pounds to any per&s;on that &s;hould apprehend St. Germain; but, he had already e&s;caped to the continent.</P>

The duke of Buckingham had made a &s;peech again&s;t per&s;ecution; and obtained permi&s;&s;ion to bring in a bill in favour of prote&s;tant nonconformi&s;ts. Even this was &s;tifled in the birth by a revival of the quarrel between the two hou&s;es.

who po&s;ted him&s;elf upon the German &s;ide of the river. The mo&s;t ma&s;terly conduct was di&s;played by both tho&s;e con&s;ummate generals; at length, Tu|renne had reduced the enemy to the nece&s;&s;ity of decamping in a few days, at a great di&s;advantage: but, before he could reap the fruits of his ingenuity, he was &s;lain by a cannon-ball, as he rode about viewing the po&s;ture of the Impe|riali&s;ts. The death of this truly great man filled the French army with in|expre&s;&s;ible grief and confu&s;ion. The &s;oldiers loved him as their father, and revered him as a being of &s;uperior &s;pecies: they were therefore incon&s;olable. Neverthele&s;s, his nephew De Lorges, who &s;ucceeded to the command, made a judicious retreat acro&s;s the Rhine: yet the &s;afety of his army was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the valour of the Engli&s;h troops that were placed in the rear, and fought the enemy with the mo&s;t de&s;perate re&s;olution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John Churchill, afterwards duke of Marl|borough, &s;erved among the&s;e auxiliaries, in the &s;tation of a private captain.</NOTE>.

<P>The campaign being ended, the eyes of all Europe were turned upon the congre&s;s at Nimeguen, where, at length, all the plenipotentiaries were a&s;|&s;embled. Lewis was de&s;irous of dividing the allies, and concluding a &s;$parate peace with Holland; and Charles, the mediator, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in that de&s;ign. Sir William Temple was ordered to treat privately with the &s;tates and the prince of Orange on this &s;ubject. The &s;tates &s;eemed willing to embrace the propo&s;al; but the prince refu&s;ed to take any &s;tep by which he might have in|curred the imputation of having betrayed tho&s;e allies who had &s;o generou&s;ly interpo&s;ed for the pre&s;ervation of his country. Perhaps this con&s;ideration was reinforced by the dictates of ambition and revenge. The Spaniards were ex|tremely aver&s;e to peace, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that Charles would &s;oon open his eyes to the inter$&s;t of England, and declare again&s;t France, rather than &s;ee Lewis in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Low-Countries: but Charles, in &s;ome ca&s;es$ looked upon his own intere&s;t as a circum&s;tance widely different from that of his people. He con&s;idered the bulk of the nation as a &s;et of turbulent, u$ruly, rebellious plebeians, who&s;e in&s;olence and ob&s;tinacy poi&s;oned all his enjoyments: whereas he regarded Lewis as his affectionate kin&s;man, his warm friend, and generous benefactor.

<P>The king, in his &s;peech to the parliament, which met in Fe|bruary, prote&s;ted he was ready to grant all the &s;ecurity in his power for the maintenance of the prote&s;tant religion, and the liberties of the people: he recommended harmony between the t$o hou&s;es, made them acquainted with his nece&s;$ities, and de&s;ired a &s;upply that would enable him to make a co$&s;ider|able addition to his navy. The commons had no &s;ooner quitted the hou&s;e of lords, than the duke of Buckingham &s;tanding up, undertook to prove that the parliament was di&s;&s;olved by the la&s;t prorogation, in con&s;equence of a &s;tat$te made in the reign of Edward III. importing, That a parliament &s;hould<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1677.</NOTE> be held once a year, or oftener, if need be. He &s;aid, that acts of parliament were not like women, the wor&s;e for being old: that although the words, "if need be," were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed when the act was renewed, the original &s;tatute

had never been repealed; nor could the king &s;et it a&s;ide, without violating the Magna Charta. He was &s;econded by the earls of Sali&s;bury, Shaft&s;bury, and the lord Wharton. Their arguments produced violent debates; but, as they tended towards an abolition of all that had been tran&s;acted in this parlia|ment, as well as to &s;edition and anarchy; tho&s;e four noblemen were com|mitted to the Tower. Buckingham, Sali&s;bury, and Wharton, after having been confined &s;ome months, made their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the king, who ordered them to be relea&s;ed. Lord Shaft&s;bury moved, in the king's-bench, that he might be di&s;charged: but the court refu&s;ed to take cognizance of the matter. He remained a whole year pri&s;oner, and then made that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by which he might have obtained his liberty, when the other three lords were di&s;charged. The hou&s;e of commons now voted the &s;um of five hundred and eighty thou|&s;and pounds to his maje&s;ty, to defray the expence of building thirty &s;hips of war: then they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, de&s;iring his maje&s;ty would take ef|fectual mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ervation of the Spani&s;h Netherlands. As the king's an&s;wer was general, they petitioned him again upon the &s;ame &s;ubject; adding, that in ca&s;e of a war with France, they would &s;upport him with all their power. He gave them to under&s;tand, that the be&s;t method for con|&s;ulting the &s;afety of the kingdom would be to enable him to put it in a pro|per po&s;ture of defence. They accordingly di&s;patched the money-bills, which received the royal a&s;&s;ent; and then the parliament was adjourned.</P>

<P>The vigour of the commons had been quickened by the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the French in Flanders. In March Lewis took Valenciennes: then di|viding his army, he &s;ent his brother the duke of Orleans to be&s;iege St. Omer, while he him&s;elf inve&s;ted Cambray. The prince of Orange marched to the re|lief of St. Omer, and was defeated by the duke of Orleans and Luxembourg at Montca&s;&s;el, from whence he retired to Ypres. Both towns fell into the hands of the enemy; and all the Spani&s;h Netherlands were left expo&s;ed. The commons had exhorted Charles to contract &s;uch alliances as would be &s;ufficient to check the ambition of the French monarch; and he had demanded a &s;upply of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds. When they met in May, they ex|pected he would impart to them the connections he had made during the ad|journment. He had taken no &s;uch mea&s;ure; but &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e by &s;ecretary Coventry, de&s;iring they would di&s;patch the money-bills, as he intended in a little time to put an end to the &s;e&s;&s;ion. Though they were well enough di&s;po&s;ed to grant the money, they in&s;i&s;ted upon having &s;ome certainty of its being applied to the proper purpo&s;es; and Charles refu&s;ed to engage in any alliances, until he &s;hould be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;upply. He expre&s;&s;ed an ap|prehen&s;ion that they intended to involve him in a war with France; and then leave him in the mid&s;t of his difficulties, unle&s;s he &s;hould purcha&s;e their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance by &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions to the prejudice of the crown. Perhaps their mu|tual di&s;tru&s;t was not altogether without foundation. In a &s;peech to them at Whitehall, he a&s;&s;ured them, upon the word of a king, that they &s;hould have no cau&s;e to repent the confidence they might repo&s;e in him, with re&s;pect to the &s;teps nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the kingdom. He at the &s;ame time declared he would not hazard their &s;afety and his own, until he &s;hould find him&s;elf in a condition to defend his people, and attack their enemies; and he told them
<PB N="462" REF="4640">
it would be their own fault if proper provi&s;ion &s;hould not be made for their defence.</P>

<P>The oppo&s;ition in the lower hou&s;e was now become too powerful for the court-party, which con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of needy cavaliers, and men of de&s;perate fortunes, who received pen&s;ions from the government, and devoted them&s;elves to the mo&s;t arbitrary mea&s;ures of the crown. This infamous practice of corruption was introduced by Clifford: but the intere&s;t of the mi|ni&s;try had been weakened by the di&s;grace of Buckingham, and the defection of Shaft&s;bury. Many members were irritated into oppo&s;ition, by di&s;appoint|ments in their expectations from the court; and other by the pernicious con|duct of the admini&s;tration. After very warm debates upon the king's &s;peech, the country-party prevailed, and an addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to the king, im|porting, That it was not the cu&s;tom of parliament to grant money for the &s;upport of alliances, before the nature of them was known. They intreated him to con|clude a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with the &s;tates-general of the United Provinces; to curb the growing power of France, and pre&s;erve the Spani&s;h Netherlands; and they explained their rea&s;ons for thinking that a war with France was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Charles, in his an&s;wer, complained that they had violated his prerogative, by in&s;i&s;ting upon his engaging in alliance with any power what&s;oever. He &s;aid the power of making peace and war was a right inherent in the crown, from which he would never recede; and then he ordered them to adjourn to the tenth day of July.</P>

<P>The earl of Danby, by the &s;ugge&s;tions of Sir William Temple, who had been recalled to England, propo&s;ed a match between the prince of Orange and the prince&s;s Mary, elde&s;t daughter to the duke of York. She and her &s;i&s;ter Anne had been educated in the prote&s;tant religion, by the king's expre&s;s command; and the prince of Orange &s;eemed to reli&s;h the pro&s;pect of &s;uch a marriage. The king at fir&s;t was neutral, or rather &s;eemed aver&s;e to this al|liance, which he knew mu&s;t be extremely di&s;agreeable to his brother: but, when Danby repre&s;ented that this marriage would in all probability bring over the prince of Orange entirely to his views, he began to &s;ee it in a different light, and permitted his nephew to vi&s;it England, after the campaign &s;hould be fini&s;hed. He accordingly arrived in England in the month of October, and repaired to the court, which was then at Newmarket. He was extremely well plea&s;ed with the character and per&s;on of Mary, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many amiable qualities; and made a formal demand of her in marriage. The duke treated him coldly, but declared his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the commands of the king, which indeed he always &s;crupulou&s;ly obeyed; and Charles con&s;ented to the match, on condition that he and the prince &s;hould fir&s;t agree upon the plan of a pacification. The prince refu&s;ed to treat of a peace, until the marriage &s;hould be con|&s;ummated. He &s;aid, he would not give his allies rea&s;on to believe that he had purcha&s;ed a wife at their expence; nor was he of a humour to barter his honour for any woman upon earth. He &s;aid to Temple, that he heartily re|pented of his coming to England: he de&s;ired him to tell the king, that he was determined to depart in two days; and that he left it in his maje&s;ty's choice, whether they &s;hould live for the future, as the be&s;t friends, or the greate&s;t enemies. The king was intimidated by the re&s;olute deportment of his nephew.
<PB N="463" REF="4650">
He knew he was extremely popular in England; and that he had maintained a corre&s;pondence during the la&s;t war with the chiefs of the Engli&s;h malcontents. Temple and Danby did not fail to repre&s;ent and exaggerate the pernicious con|&s;equences of a rupture with the prince of Orange; and Charles agreed to the prince's own terms. The portion of the prince&s;s was fixed at forty thou|&s;and pounds: the marriage-articles were executed: the king declared the match in council: the city of London received the news with extraordinary demon|&s;trations of joy and approbation: the mayor regaled the whole court with great magnificence: and the nuptials were celebrated on the fourth day of November.</P>

<P>This affair being happily concluded to the general &s;atisfaction of the nation, the king and prince entered into conferences for a plan of pacification, at which the duke of York, the earl of Danby, and Sir William Temple a&s;&s;i&s;ted. After &s;ome di&s;pute they agreed, That Lewis &s;hould re&s;tore all he had wre&s;ted from the emperor and the duke of Lorraine: That there &s;hould be a reciprocal re&s;titution between France and Holland; and, That Spain &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Aeth, Oudenarde, Charleroy, Courtray, Tournay, Cond&eacute;, Valenciennes, Saint-Guillain, and Binch. The prince promi&s;ed to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours in per&s;uading the &s;tates-general to accept of the&s;e con|ditions; and Charles undertook to recommend them to the French monarch. He declared he would never depart from this plan, but declare war again&s;t the French king, &s;hould he prove refractory; and, with this a&s;&s;urance, the prince returned with his bride to Holland. Mr. de Duras, afterwards earl of Fever|&s;ham, was &s;ent as amba&s;&s;ador to France, with intimation of this agreement; which, though it mu&s;t have been extremely di&s;agreeable to Lewis, he received without any emotion of re&s;entment. He &s;aid, the king of England knew he might always command a peace; but he thought it was hard to part with &s;ome of tho&s;e towns in Flanders, upon the fortifications of which he had expended con&s;iderable &s;ums of money: he hoped his brother would not break with him for a few towns; but even with regard to the&s;e, he would &s;end in&s;tructions to Barillon, his amba&s;&s;ador at London.</P>

<P>The French king knew he was ma&s;ter of one argument which would always have weight with &s;uch a nece&s;&s;itous and prodigal prince as Charles. Barillon received orders to give up all the towns except Tournay, and even promi&s;e an equivalent for that, rather than break off the treaty: but that mi|ni&s;ter cajoled the king in &s;uch a manner, that his agreement with the prince of Orange was &s;oon forgotten, and a negotiation of a very different nature begun. This was no other than a &s;tipulation of conditions, in con&s;ideration of which the king of England &s;hould forbear from declaring in favour of the allies, notwith|&s;tanding the importunities of his parliament. The treaty was carried on by Montague, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, who demanded two hundred thou|&s;and pounds a year, while the war &s;hould continue; but Courtin, who re&s;ided in London, prevailed upon Charles to re&s;t contented with two millions of livres. Montague afterwards received in&s;tructions from Danby, to in&s;i&s;t upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temple. Burnet. Rapin.

<P>Charles had prolonged the adjournment, until he &s;hould have con|cluded a new league with Holland, which was &s;igned in January. Though this was only a defen&s;ive alliance, to prevent the French king from extending his conque&s;ts in the Low Countries, the king thought it would dazzle the eyes of his parliament &s;o as to produce wonderful effects in his favour. When they a&s;&s;embled in January, he told them he had concluded an alliance with Hol|land, which could not fail of pre&s;erving Flanders, unle&s;s the commons &s;hould refu&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies. He &s;aid, that finding his endeavours after peace ineffectual, he had recalled his troops from France: that, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, the nation could not be without ninety &s;hips of the line in commi&s;&s;ion, and an army of thirty thou&s;and men: that they might take what precautions they &s;hould judge proper for appropriating the &s;upplies to the purpo&s;es of the war. He communicated the marriage of his niece with the prince of Orange: he demanded an aid proportionable to the nece&s;&s;ities of the kingdom, and the important de&s;igns he had projected for the honour and advantage of his people. The commons, in&s;tead of &s;ignifying their approbation of his conduct, and their readine&s;s to acquie&s;ce in his propo&s;als, petitioned, in an addre&s;s, That he would not engage in any treaty with France, until &s;he &s;hould be reduced to the &s;ame condition in which &s;he was at the peace of the Pyrenees: and they gave him to under&s;tand, that whenever he &s;hould be plea&s;ed to com|municate the nature of his alliances to his faithful commons, they would enable him to pro&s;ecute the war, or procure an honourable peace. He com|plained of this addre&s;s as an inva&s;ion of his prerogative. He told them they were mi&s;taken if they thought he would give up his undoubted right of making peace and war; but, that if once he &s;hould be enabled by their means to under|take a war, it &s;hould not be fini&s;hed until he &s;hould have procured a &s;olid peace for all the powers of Chri&s;tendom: in the mean time, he ob&s;erved that new alliances could not be contracted without the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, which he there|fore recommended to their attention.</P>

<P>During the&s;e di&s;putes between the king and parliament, the king of France, taking the field early in the &s;pring, reduced Ghent and Ypres, and then di&s;tributed his troops in quarters of refre&s;hment. This progre&s;s alarmed the Dutch in &s;uch a manner, that they re&s;olved to conclude a &s;eparate peace. Lewis, knowing his own advantage, and that he had nothing to fear from the king of England; talked in the &s;train of a conqueror, and in&s;i&s;ted upon terms very different from tho&s;e which had been planned by Charles and the prince of Orange. In April the chancellor told the two hou&s;es, in the king's name, that the Dutch certainly intended to conclude a &s;eparate peace with France; and his maje&s;ty demanded their advice on that &s;ubject. The commons exhorted him to declare war again&s;t France: then they voted the alliance with Holland not an&s;werable to their addre&s;s, nor &s;ufficient for the &s;ecurity of the kingdom. Charles expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;&s;atisfaction at this vote, notwith&s;tanding which they pre&s;ented another addre&s;s, de&s;iring to know the re&s;olutions he had taken in con&s;equence of their advice; that he would pay more attention to their addre&s;&s;es; and that he would remove the duke of Lauderdale from his coun|cils. The king replied, That he was &s;urpri&s;ed at the extravagance of their addre&s;s, to which he would not at pre&s;ent make the an&s;wer it de&s;erved. As
<PB N="465" REF="4670">
they had already pa&s;&s;ed a poll-tax for the &s;ervice of the year, he began to make levies, which were carried on with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing diligence and &s;ucce&s;s, that in &s;ix weeks his army of thirty thou&s;and men was completed. The duke of Monmouth was &s;ent over with three thou&s;and to garri&s;on Oftend, a fleet was equipped, and the court breathed nothing but defiance again&s;t the French monarch.</P>

<P>The &s;tates-general, appri&s;ed of the&s;e preparations, di&s;patched Van Lewin as their amba&s;&s;ador to London, with in&s;tructions to declare, That if the king of England would immediately denounce war again&s;t France, they would break off their negotiation with Lewis, and act vigorou&s;ly in conjunction with their allies. Charles, finding him&s;elf obliged to give a categorical an&s;wer, told Sir William Temple, who brought the propo&s;al from the Dutch amba&s;|&s;ador, that, &s;eeing the &s;tates were contented to accept of the conditions which France had pre&s;cribed, and Lewis had offered to purcha&s;e with a &s;um of money his con&s;ent to that which he could not prevent, he &s;aw no rea&s;on for rejecting the gratuity. He therefore ordered Temple to treat with Barillon, the French amba&s;&s;ador; but Sir William refu&s;ed to be concerned in &s;uch a &s;candalous ne|gotiation. He found others, however, who undertook the office. The bargain was &s;truck for three hundred thou&s;and pounds; but Barillon afterwards gave him to under&s;tand that his ma&s;ter would not pay the money unle&s;s he would engage, by a &s;ecret article, that he would never maintain an army that &s;hould exceed eight thou&s;and men, reckoning the whole force in his three kingdoms. When this demand was &s;ignified to Charles, <Q>&startq;Cod's fi&s;h! (&s;aid he) does my brother of France think to &s;erve me thus? Are all his promi&s;es to make me ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of my people come to this? Or, does he think it a thing to be done with eight thou&s;and men?&endq;</Q> This exclamation plainly proves, that Charles had entertained &s;uch a de&s;ign; though the preparations in which he was now employed, &s;eem to have been made with a view to rai&s;e the price of his neutrality with the French monarch. At this juncture he certainly held the ballance of power in Europe: but he had neither ambition to act as umpire among the princes of Chri&s;tendom, nor re&s;olution to pro&s;ecute any plan of importance; and, with re&s;pect to the intere&s;ts of his country, he was ab&s;olutely indifferent. He never exerted him&s;elf but in tran&s;ient efforts, as he chanced to be &s;timulated by the clamours of his parliament, the importunity of his wants, or the ince&s;&s;ant in&s;tigation of tho&s;e who enjoyed his confidence.</P>

<P>When the two hou&s;es met in May, in vain he had recour&s;e to promi&s;es and intreatics. The commons re&s;olved, that &s;hould his maje&s;ty think proper to declare war again&s;t France, they would enable him to maintain it: otherwi&s;e they would concert mea&s;ures for di&s;banding the army. The king alledged, that Lewis had offered a truce till the twenty-&s;eventh day of July; and until that term &s;hould be expired, it would be improper to di&s;band the forces. Notwith|&s;tanding this declaration, they voted that the troops levied &s;ince the month of September &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;ied. On the eighteenth day of June, Charles told the two hou&s;es, in a &s;peech, that the peace between France, Spain, and Holland, was almo&s;t as good as concluded: he &s;aid, the Spaniards had po&s;itively declared they were not able to bear the expence of maintaining garri&s;ons in Flanders, which mu&s;t be left expo&s;ed, unle&s;s England would undertake to &s;upport the fortifications: he therefore ob&s;erved, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to keep a good fleet
<PB N="466" REF="4680">
at &s;ea; and, in particular, to provide for the &s;afety of O&s;tend, where otherwi&s;e the French might maintain a fleet of forty &s;hips of war, exactly oppo&s;ite to the mouth of the Thames. If they de&s;ired he &s;hould live in &s;$rict union with his parliament, they would make an addition of three hundred thou&s;and pounds to his revenue, in which ca&s;e they might bring in a bill for appropriating fifty thou&s;and yearly to the &s;upport of the fleet and artillery: then he would be always ready to pa&s;s whatever acts &s;hould be propo&s;ed for the benefit of the nation. Finally, he de&s;ired they would remember that he had engaged to pay forty thou&s;and pounds for the portion of the prince&s;s Mary: that the fir&s;t m$$ety was already due, and demanded by the prince of Orange. This &s;peech had no other effect but that of irritating the commons, who ab&s;olutely rejected the propo&s;al touching the augmentation of the revenue. They likewi&s;e fini&s;hed the bill for di&s;banding the army; granting, however, &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds for the payment of it. The king having pa&s;&s;ed it, together with another for an additional tax upon wine for three years; and a third, decreeing that the dead &s;hould be buried in flannel, for the benefit of the woollen manu|facture; the parliament was prorogued.</P>

<P>Mean while the &s;t$$$$-general negotiated a peace with France for them&s;elves and Spain; and Lewis having agreed to re&s;tore Ghent, Aeth, Charle$oy, Oudenarde, Courtray, and Limbou$g, to his mo&s;t catholic maje&s;ty; the Dutch amba&s;&s;adors received orders to &s;ign the treaty: but, when the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador demanded of the French plenipotentiaries at what time tho&s;e towns &s;hould be re&s;tored; they were given to under&s;tand that the French king would detain them until the allies &s;hould have made re&s;titution of the places they had wre&s;ted from the crown of Sweden. This declaration retarded the conclu&s;ion of the treaty. Charles was &s;o incen&s;ed at this conduct of Lewis, that he forth|with &s;ent Sir William Temple to the Hague, with full power to &s;ign a mutual league with the &s;tates, by which the contracting powers obliged them&s;elves to compel France by force of arms to re&s;tore the &s;ix towns in Flanders.

<P>This was a vigorous mea&s;ure, which the king of England had not &s;teadine&s;s enough to &s;upport. He &s;ent Du Cros, the Swedi&s;h agent at London, with an order to Temple, commanding him to repair forthwith to Nimeguen, and tell the Swedi&s;h plenipotentiaries, in his name, that if they would con&s;ent to the immediate evacuation of the &s;ix places in Flanders, he would, after the conclu&s;ion of the peace, employ all his intere&s;t in procuring the re&s;titution of the towns which their ma&s;ter had lo&s;t during the war. Du Cros no &s;ooner arri|ved in Holland, than he vi&s;ited the deputies of the &s;tates apart; and not only made them acquainted with the order he had received for Sir William Temple; but a&s;&s;ured them, at the &s;ame time, that the kings of France and England had already agreed upon a plan of a pacification, from which Charles would never deviate, notwith&s;tanding his la&s;t treaty with the &s;tates-general. Neverthele&s;s the Dutch plenipotentiaries at Nimeguen re&s;olutely refu&s;ed to &s;ign the peace, unle&s;s the French king would engage to make immediate re&s;titution of the &s;ix towns; and the French amba&s;&s;adors &s;eemed inflexible till the very la&s;t day of the con|gre&s;s, which was the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, when all of a &s;udden they de&s;i&s;ted from their preten&s;ions, and the treaty was &s;igned. This was &s;oon followed by an

<P>For a cour&s;e of twelve years, Lauderdale had governed Scotland with the mo&s;t cruel and perfidious de&s;poti&s;m; except during a &s;mall intermi&s;&s;ion while the government was in the hands of the earl of Tweddale and Sir Robert Murray, men of moderate principles, and di&s;cretion. Epi&s;copacy had been &s;et|tled in that kingdom, but was &s;o contrary to the genius of the people, that con|venticles multiplied every day. The e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy were in&s;ulted; and the covenanters became extremely in&s;olent and trouble&s;ome, not contented with the indulgence and toleration they enjoyed by the connivance of the government. The two acts procured in the parliament of Scotland, relating to the king's &s;upremacy and the militia, rendered Lauderdale as ab&s;olute as any ea&s;tern em|peror. He pa&s;&s;ed other laws again&s;t nonconformi&s;ts, by virtue of which he fined, impri&s;oned, and bani&s;hed the &s;ubject: &s;o that his admini&s;tration was a mo&s;t cruel and perfidious inqui&s;ition, promoted by Sharpe, archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's. His conduct in civil affairs was equally unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive: he laid re&s;trictions upon trade; impo&s;ed heavy duties, and granted monopolies to his own creatures. A party was formed again&s;t him by the duke of Hamilton, the earl of Tweddale, and &s;ome other noblemen, who repre&s;ented his iniquity to the king. They were graciou&s;ly received; but Lauderdale &s;till continued in authority. He now gave a loo&s;e to the mo&s;t furious revenge. He influ|enced the privy-council of that kingdom to convert the hou&s;es of tho&s;e who had complained of his admini&s;tration into garri&s;ons for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing conventicles$ and the &s;oldiers were encouraged to plunder and de&s;troy the effects of tho&s;e whom they had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The lawyers of Edinburgh having a&s;&s;erted, that appeals to parliament were legal, the king's order was obtained for bani&s;hing them twelve miles from that city: and the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice was &s;topped for a whole year. Twelve of the chief magi&s;trates were declared incapable of public office, for no other crime than that of refu&s;ing the mo&s;t &s;ervile compliance with the orders of Lauderdale. Individuals were impri&s;oned in the mo&s;t arbitrary man|ner, and all employments &s;et to &s;ale. Bonds were impo&s;ed upon the landholders of the we&s;tern &s;hires in which pre&s;byteriani&s;m chiefly prevailed, obliging them to be an&s;werable in the affair of conventicles, for their &s;ervants, tenants, and dependants. Becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to &s;ign the&s;e iniquitous obligations, the country was deemed to be in a &s;tate of rebellion. Eight thou&s;and Highlanders, in con&s;equence of an order of council, were a&s;&s;embled by &s;ome of the chieftains; and the&s;e being joined by the guards, marched into the We&s;t, where they lived at di&s;cretion for two months, during which they committed every &s;pecies of cruelty, rapine, and outrage. A great number of preachers and their hearers
<PB N="468" REF="4700">
were "intercommuned;" a &s;tep taken in that country, previous to outlawry; and, that the cry of the oppre&s;&s;ed people might not reach the throne, all noble|men and landholders were forbid, under &s;evere penalties, to quit the kingdom. Notwith&s;tanding this injunction by act of council, the duke of Hamilton, the earls of Ca&s;&s;els and Tweddale repaired to London, and layed the mi&s;erable &s;tate of their country before Charles, who i&s;&s;ued orders for di&s;continuing the bonds and writs of intercommuning; but expre&s;&s;ed no indignation again&s;t L$uderdale, who had abu&s;ed his authority. In the ab&s;ence of the&s;e noblemen, the duke was allowed to &s;ummon a convention of the e&s;tates; which, in their<NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> addre&s;&s;es to the king, expre&s;&s;ed their entire &s;atisfaction with Lauderdale's ad|mini&s;tration: a &s;ure mark of the abject &s;lavery to which that wretched people were reduced.</P>

<P>AT this period, the attention of the Engli&s;h nation was engro&s;&s;ed by a very remarkable in&s;tance of villainy and impo&s;ture, that rai&s;ed an univer&s;al ferment among the people, and operated in defiance of common &s;en&s;e and demon&s;tration. On the twelfth day of Augu&s;t, one Kirby a chymi&s;t, ap|proaching the king in St. James's park, <Q>&startq;Sir (&s;aid he) keep within the com|pany: your enemies have a de&s;ign upon your life.&endq;</Q> Being que&s;tioned fur|ther in con&s;equence of this &s;trange intimation, he offered to produce one doctor Tongue, a weak, credulous clergyman, who had told him, that two per&s;ons, named Grove and Pickering, were engaged to murder the king; and that Sir George Wakeman, the queen's phy&s;ician, had undertaken to take away his maje&s;ty's life by poi&s;on, &s;hould the attempts of tho&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins mi&s;carry. Tongue was intro|duced to the king, with a bundle of papers, relating to this pretended con&s;pi|racy, and referred to the lord trea&s;urer Danby. He &s;aid the papers were thru&s;t under his door; and afterwards declared he knew the author of them, who de&s;ired his name might be concealed, as he dreaded the re&s;entment of the je&s;uits. The information he gave was &s;o vague and improbable, that Charles conclu|ded the whole was a fiction. A pacquet of letters, directed to Bedingfield, confe&s;&s;or to the duke of York, no &s;ooner came to hand, than he delivered them to his royal highne&s;s, as papers of dangerous import, which he did not under|&s;tand: but they &s;eemed calculated to involve him in trouble, and were ma|nife&s;tly forged; as he knew the hand-writing of the per&s;ons in who&s;e names they were &s;ub&s;cribed. The king had been previou&s;ly informed of this pacquet by Tongue, who declared it was &s;ent by the je&s;uits who had con&s;pired again&s;t his life. When he therefore compared this intimation with the behaviour of Bedingfield, and the contents of the letters; he was more and more per&s;uaded that the whole plot was an impo&s;ture, and de&s;ired that it might be concealed from the knowlege of the public, le&s;t it &s;hould produce a new flame among the people. The duke, however, was &s;o &s;ollicitous to acquit the je&s;uits, and e&s;pecially his own confe&s;&s;or, of all imputation, that he in&s;i&s;ted upon a minute inquiry before the council.</P>

<P>Then Titus Oates, the fountain of all this intelligence, made his ap|pearance. He was an abandoned mi&s;creant, ob&s;cure, illiterate, and indi|gent. He had been once indicted for perjury, afterwards chaplain of a king's &s;hip, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for unnatural practices. Then he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Ro|man catholic, and cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to St. Omer, where he was for &s;ome time maintained in the Engli&s;h college. The fathers of that &s;eminary &s;ent him with &s;ome di&s;patches to Spain; but, after his return, when they became better acquainted with his character, they would not &s;uffer him to continue in the college, and he came over to London, where he could hardly &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the mi&s;erable pittance which they allowed for his &s;upport. There he cultivated an acquaintance with Tongue and Kirby, and probably, with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, contrived this plot, partly to improve his circum&s;tances, and partly to gratify
<PB N="471" REF="4730">
his thir&s;t of revenge again&s;t the je&s;uits, who had treated him with &s;uch con|tempt. Finding the king had payed very little regard to the &s;ugge&s;tions of his two friends, he re&s;olved to try his fate with the public, which always li&s;tened greedily to every charge again&s;t the catholics; and for this purpo&s;e voluntarily &s;wore to the truth of his information, before Sir Edmund&s;bury Godfrey, an active ju&s;tice of the peace, who lived in We&s;tmin&s;ter. He pre|tended that the pope had a&s;&s;umed the &s;overeignty of England as St. Peter's patrimony, and delegated his authority to Oliva, general of the je&s;uits, who had expedited commi&s;&s;ions for all the offices civil and military in the government of Great Britain and Ireland: that the eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities were likewi&s;e con|ferred upon Roman catholic prie&s;ts, foreigners as well as natives: that they had tried the king under the name of the black ba&s;tard, condemned him as an heretic, and re&s;olved to deprive him of life: that, when he (Oates) returned from France, a general meeting of the je&s;uits had been held at the White Hor&s;e tavern in the Strand, where they determined to take off the king, by &s;hooting, &s;tabbing, or poi&s;on: that &s;everal attempts had been already made without &s;ucce&s;s; and that Coleman, &s;ecretary to the duke of York, was not only acquainted with their de&s;igns, but al&s;o corre&s;ponded on this &s;ubject with father * La Chai&s;e, confe&s;&s;or to the French king. A great number of je&s;uits, whom he named, were immediately taken into cu&s;tody. Coleman at fir&s;t re|tired; but next day &s;urrendered him&s;elf to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and &s;ome of his papers were &s;ecured. Oates did not know him per&s;onally, when he was produced at the council, and only charged him upon hear&s;ay: he likewi&s;e mentioned Wakeman the king's phy&s;ician. Being a&s;ked if he knew any thing to his prejudice, he an&s;wered, "No;" adding, <Q>&startq;God forbid I &s;hould &s;ay any thing more than I know: I would not do that for all the world.&endq;</Q> He &s;aid, in the cour&s;e of his examination, that he had been in Spain, and conferred with Don John, who had promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t them powerfully in their de&s;igns. The king de&s;iring him to de&s;cribe the per&s;on of Don John, he &s;aid he was a tall thin man: but Charles him&s;elf knew he was &s;hort and corpulent. His ma|je&s;ty a&s;ked another que&s;tion touching the &s;ituation of the je&s;uit college in Paris, in which Oates &s;aid he had been pre&s;ent at a con&s;ult; and he made &s;uch an an&s;wer as plainly proved he had never &s;een the place. He affirmed that the je&s;uits had counterfeited the duke's &s;eal, which they u&s;ed occa&s;ionally; and that they intended to take away his life, &s;hould he prove refractory: that they had de&s;tined a good number of noblemen and prelates to death: that they had u&s;ed &s;eventeen hundred fire balls, and four&s;core firemen, in beginning the conflagration in London; and were determined to &s;eize that opportunity of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the king; but their hearts relented when they &s;aw him exert him|&s;elf with &s;uch humanity for the relief of the &s;ufferers. He declared that the je&s;uits fomented the faction in Scotland again&s;t the duke of Lauderdale; and that he had &s;een and been intru&s;ted with many letters relating to this con|&s;piracy. <NOTE PLACE="foot">&dagger; Oates was &s;o ignorant, that he called him father la Shee. He did not once mention Lang|horne the lawyer, who was a per&s;on of note, and managed all the affairs of the je&s;uits in England. When Dr. Burnet a&s;ked him in private, what arguments the je&s;uits had u&s;ed for his conver&s;ion to the Roman catholic religion, he laid his hands upon his brea&s;t, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;God and his holy an|gels know I never changed; but went among them on purpo&s;e to betray them.&endq;</Q> He &s;poke with great pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t the &s;ociety, and &s;aid he would have their blood.</NOTE></P>

<P>The apprehen&s;ions of the people were &s;urpri&s;ingly arou&s;ed, and their re&s;entment kindled even to &s;ury at this information, every particular of which they implicitly believed. It was &s;uppo&s;ed to be confirmed by Coleman's let|ters, which contained &s;ome my&s;terious hints about extirpating the prote&s;tant here&s;y, the great zeal of the duke, and the mercenary &s;pirit of his brother. But what e&s;tabli&s;hed its credit beyond all doubt or he&s;itation, in the opinion of the multitude, was the death of Sir Edmund&s;bury Godfrey, who, after having been lo&s;t for &s;everal days, was found dead in a ditch by Primro&s;e-hill in the way to Hamp&s;tead. His own &s;word was thru&s;t through his body; but no blood had flowed from the wound: &s;o that in all probability he had been dead &s;ome time before this method was taken to deceive the public. His gloves lay by him; and there was money in his pocket. A broad, livid mark appeared quite round his neck, which was broken; his brea&s;t exhibited &s;ome marks of brui&s;es; and on his breeches were found &s;everal drops of wax-lights, which he never u&s;ed in his own family. The clamour was immediately rai&s;ed again&s;t the pa|pi&s;ts, as the authors of this murder; and the duke of Norfolk incurred &s;ome &s;u&s;picion, from the officious manner in which he had retailed different reports to the council, before the body was found. He told them Godfrey had made a &s;candalous marriage, and retired from the deri&s;ion of the public: he &s;hifted the &s;cene of the tran&s;action from place to place; and the decea&s;ed had been &s;een near Arundel-hou&s;e, immediately before he di&s;appeared. The populace were now exa&s;perated to &s;uch a degree, that moderate men began to dread a general ma&s;&s;acre of the Roman catholics. The body of Godfrey was carried through the &s;treets in proce&s;&s;ion, preceded by &s;eventy clergymen, attended with a va&s;t multitude, and expo&s;ed in public for &s;everal days, during which this melancholy &s;pectacle produced a mo&s;t inflammatory effect upon the be|holders. Even the better &s;ort of people were infected with all the vulgar pre|judices of the lower cla&s;s; and the &s;treams of re&s;entment and credulity ran &s;o high, that no man could, with any regard to per&s;onal &s;afety, expre&s;s the lea&s;t doubt concerning the information of Oates, or the murder of Godfrey.</P>

<P>The parliament meeting while the people were in this agitation, Charles could not help taking &s;ome notice of the con&s;piracy; but he touched upon it &s;lightly, &s;aying, he &s;hould forbear delivering his opinion on the &s;ubject, le&s;t he &s;hould be thought to &s;ay too much or too little. He was &s;till de&s;irous of &s;tifling an enquiry which might involve the kingdom in confu&s;ion, and redound to the prejudice of his brother, whom he knew to be a bigotted papi&s;t. His intention, however, was fru&s;trated by the earl of Danby, who, either from enmity to the catholics, or a de&s;ire of acquiring popularity, di&s;|clo&s;ed the whole affair in the hou&s;e of peers, and expatiated upon the danger to which the king's life was expo&s;ed by this con&s;piracy. Charles was very much di&s;plea&s;ed at his conduct upon this occa&s;ion. <Q>&startq;You have (&s;aid he) given them a handle to ruin your&s;elf, as well as to di&s;turb my affairs.&endq;</Q> The country-party in the parliament would not let &s;lip &s;uch an opportunity of managing the pa&s;&s;ions of the people; while the creatures of the court were a&s;toni&s;hed and intimidated into &s;ilence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. An addre&s;s was pre|&s;ented for a fa&s;t, and a new form of prayer compo&s;ed for the occa&s;ion. The two hou&s;es petitioned that all popi&s;h recu&s;ants &s;hould be obliged to leave London; and that no &s;tranger &s;hould be permitted to approach his maje&s;ty's
<PB N="473" REF="4750">
per&s;on. Yet, in all the&s;e three addre&s;&s;es, they did not limit their fears to the king's per&s;on; but expre&s;&s;ed their apprehen&s;ion of the danger that threatened the prote&s;tant religion. This was the note which had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;ounded in the ears of the people, by the members of the former long parlia|ment. Oates was now examined by the commons, and made &s;everal additions to his fir&s;t declaration. He affirmed, that the pope had by commi&s;&s;ions ap|pointed lord Arundel of Wardour chancellor, lord Powis trea&s;urer, Sir Wil|liam Godolphin privy-&s;eal, lord Bella&s;is general, lord Petre lieutenant-general, lord Radcliffe major-general, lord Stafford payma&s;ter-general, Coleman &s;e|cretary of &s;tate, and Langhorne advocate-general. This lawyer he had not mentioned at the council-board; but now he in&s;i&s;ted upon having &s;een the com|mi&s;&s;ions in Langhorne's chamber, and upon having delivered &s;ome of them with his own hands. He likewi&s;e accu&s;ed Coleman and Wakeman, upon his own knowledge: the fir&s;t as having employed four ruffians to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king at Wind&s;or, in the preceding &s;ummer: the other, who&s;e per&s;on he did not know at his fir&s;t examination, he now charged with having undertaken, for the con&s;ideration of fifteen thou&s;and pounds, to poi&s;on his maje&s;ty. If Oates had actually profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Roman catholic, on purpo&s;e to betray the je&s;uits, and had even been intru&s;ted with tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ions and letters, he certainly would have retained and produced &s;ome of them, in order to cor|roborate and a&s;certain the truth of his evidence. He had boa&s;ted to the king of having ventured his &s;oul in his &s;ervice; but, if he had really acted from &s;uch motives, he would not have allowed four ruffians to repair to Wind&s;or, on purpo&s;e to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his &s;overeign, without giving intelligence of their de&s;ign. It were an idle ta&s;k to detect the fal&s;hood of an information which contains &s;uch a number of palpable ab&s;urdities. The two hou&s;es voted it a mo&s;t dan|gerous con&s;piracy; and the lords above-mentioned were committed to the Tower. The trained-bands of London were ordered to be in readine&s;s: the two hou&s;es &s;at every day, to con&s;ider the dangerous plot: a committee of lords were appointed to examine witne&s;&s;es; and they were &s;upplied with blank warrants, for committing &s;uch per&s;ons as they &s;hould find cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect. Oates was recommended to the king by the parliament, protected by guards, accommo|dated with a pen&s;ion of twelve hundred pounds, and extolled as the &s;aviour of the nation. The king expelled the catholics from London, and from his guards, by proclamation: but the parliament was not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;atisfied. The com|mons brought in a bill for preventing the danger that aro&s;e from popi&s;h mem|bers, e&s;pecially in the hou&s;e of peers. This was a previous &s;tep to more vi|gorous mea&s;ures concerted again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the duke of York. The leading men in the upper hou&s;e, at this juncture, were the duke of Buckingham, the earl of Shaft&s;bury, the lords E&s;&s;ex and Halifax. They were all aver&s;e to a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or; but the two fir&s;t acted from private animo&s;ity. The king perceived the drift of the commons, who had actually begun to debate upon an addre&s;s for petitioning his maje&s;ty to remove the duke from his per&s;on and councils. He therefore, on the ninth day of November, in a &s;peech to both hou&s;es, declared his readine&s;s to pa&s;s all rea&s;onable bills, provided they &s;hould have no tendency to de&s;troy the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the true branch, nor to re&s;train his authority, and the ju&s;t rights of his prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, a new informer appeared, in the per&s;on of one Bedloe, who, in a letter to Mr. Secretary Coventry, from Newbury, on the road to Bri&s;tol, de&s;ired that he might be apprehended by warrant, as he could make &s;ome important di&s;coveries. He was an infamous cheat, who had been detected in many different branches of knavery. He had made &s;hift to live by impo&s;ture, and travelled over great part of Europe in borrowed charac|ters. He was, according to his de&s;ire, arre&s;ted at Bri&s;tol, and conveyed to London. He declared before the council, that he had &s;een the body of Sir Edmund&s;bury Godfrey in the queen's palace at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e: that a &s;ervant of lord Bella&s;is had offered to gratify him with four thou&s;and pounds, if he would a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying it away; but that he had declined the office, and gone into the country, where he was &s;o di&s;turbed by the horrors of con&s;cience, that he could enjoy no peace of mind, until he had addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the &s;ecretary. At his fir&s;t examination, in the king's pre&s;ence, he &s;aid he knew nothing of the plot; but had heard that forty thou&s;and Spaniards were ready to rendez|vous as pilgrims at St. Jago, from whence they would be tran&s;ported to Eng|land. Next day, however, when examined by the committee of lords, he re|collected all the particulars of the con&s;piracy, on his own knowledge; and, to render him&s;elf the more acceptable, added a great many circum&s;tances of his own invention. The king told Dr. Burnet, that Bedloe had certainly been tutored, in the interval between his fir&s;t and &s;econd examination. He now &s;aid, that there was a de&s;ign of landing ten thou&s;and men at Burlington bay, from Flanders; and of &s;urpri&s;ing the i&s;lands of Jer&s;ey and Guern&s;ey by an embarkation from Bre&s;t. He affirmed, that the lords Powis and Petre had un|dertaken to rai&s;e an army in Radnor&s;hire, to join tho&s;e that would arrive from Spain: that fifty thou&s;and men were ready to ri&s;e in London: that lord Staf|ford, Coleman, and Ireland, had received money &s;ufficient to defray the ex|pence of tho&s;e armaments: that he him&s;elf had been tampered with, to under|take the murder of a man, in con&s;ideration of which he &s;hould have four thou&s;and pounds, a commi&s;&s;ion from lord Bella&s;is, and the pope's benediction. He pretended they were re&s;olved to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king, ma&s;&s;acre the pro|te&s;tants; and, &s;hould the duke refu&s;e to hold the kingdom of the pope, the chief authority would be ve&s;ted in certain noblemen nominated by his holine&s;s. He likewi&s;e accu&s;ed the lords Carrington and Brudenel, who were committed to cu&s;tody by order of parliament. He charged the fire of London, as well as a &s;ub&s;equent di&s;a&s;ter of the &s;ame kind in Southwark, upon the catholics, who hoped to find an opportunity to ma&s;&s;acre the prote&s;tants, in &s;uch &s;cenes of tumult and confu&s;ion; or at lea&s;t to enrich them&s;elves with the &s;poils of their enemies.</P>

<P>Bedloe's di&s;covery needs no comment; though it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that France and Spain was at war when this project of inva&s;ion was &s;uppo&s;ed to be concerted between tho&s;e two powers: that the king of Spain, far from being in a condition to tran&s;port forty thou&s;and men upon &s;uch a project, could not afford garri&s;ons for the towns in Flanders, which, at his de&s;ire, were &s;ecured by Engli&s;h troops; and that, after the mo&s;t rigorous and unexpected &s;earch, no arms, ammunition, commi&s;&s;ions, or papers, were found, to confirm the evidence of Oates and Bedloe. Neverthele&s;s, &s;uch was the torrent of prejudice, &s;uch the frenzy of the people, that no incon&s;i&s;t|encies
<PB N="475" REF="4770">
were &s;een, no facts compared, no objections &s;tarted. Rea&s;on was wholly abandoned, and the mo&s;t incomprehen&s;ible circum&s;tances were the mo&s;t de|voutly believed. They threw a veil of my&s;tery over the whole de&s;ign, which did not fail to excite the veneration of the public, even to a dangerous degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m. The &s;tory would have been le&s;s believed, had it been more con&s;i&s;tent and intelligible. The commons, in an addre&s;s, be&s;ought his ma|je&s;ty to appoint commi&s;&s;ioners for tendering the oaths of allegiance and &s;upre|macy to his own dome&s;tics, tho&s;e of the duke of York, and all re&s;iding in the palaces of Whitehall, St. James's, and Somer&s;et-hou&s;e. The king de&s;ired that the &s;ervants of the queen, and dutche&s;s of York, might be excepted; but, in a &s;econd petition, they in&s;i&s;ted upon their former demand. Under&s;tanding that commi&s;&s;ions had been granted to officers who had not taken the oaths, they committed &s;ecretary William&s;on to the Tower, for having counter&s;igned &s;uch commi&s;&s;ions. The king immediately relea&s;ed him. The commons ju&s;ti|fied what they had done in another addre&s;s, de&s;iring that he might be detained in cu&s;tody; and that all the popi&s;h officers &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Charles told them that William&s;on was already relea&s;ed; but that he would di&s;mi&s;s the of|ficers again&s;t whom they had objected. Then they proceeded on the bill for rendering papi&s;ts incapable of fitting in parliament: they brought in another for di&s;banding the troops; and a third for maintaining part of the militia in arms for a certain term. Charles gave his a&s;&s;ent to the two former; but this la&s;t he ab&s;olutely rejected, declaring, that he would not part with the command of the militia; no, not for an hour: he offered, however, to keep the third part of it on foot, for the &s;ecurity of the government, provided they would grant a &s;upply &s;ufficient to maintain &s;uch a force; but they did not think pro|per to embrace the propo&s;al. When the bill for excluding all members who &s;hould refu&s;e the te&s;t oaths, was brought into the hou&s;e of peers, the duke of York moved that an exception might be admitted in his favour. He beg|ged this indulgence, with tears in his eyes, declaring, that his religion was a private concern between God and his own &s;oul; and that it &s;hould never ap|pear in his public conduct. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e earne&s;t intreaties, he carried his point by two votes only.</P>

<P>Edward Coleman being brought to his trial, was convicted on the evidence of Oates and Bedloe. The former &s;wore he had &s;ent four&s;core guineas to the ruffian who undertook to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king: the date of this tran&s;action he fixed to the month of Augu&s;t; but would not &s;pecify the par|ticular day. Coleman could have proved he was in the country, during the greater part of that month$ and therefore the witne&s;s would not be particular. His letters to father la Chai&s;e were, in all probability, more heavy upon him than the evidence of Oates and Bedloe: not that they contained any trea&s;on|able expre&s;&s;ions; but they were replece with marks of impertinent zeal again&s;t the prote&s;tant religion. After his &s;entence, many members of both hou&s;es offered to interpo&s;e in his behalf, if he would make an ample confe&s;&s;ion. They hoped the love of life would have prompted him to accu&s;e the duke his ma&s;ter; but he per&s;i&s;ted to the la&s;t moment in prote&s;ting his own innocence, and vindicating the character of his royal highne&s;s. He owned the indi&s;cre|tion of his own conduct, and &s;ome private frauds he had committed; but died in great compo&s;ure, denying every tittle of what had been laid to his charge;
<PB N="47$" REF="4780">
and decliring$ before God, that he had never &s;een Oates but once; and never once &s;aw Bedloe before he was apprehended.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Charles &s;till maintained his fir&s;t opinion of the con&s;piracy, which he ridiculed in private among tho&s;e in whom he could confide; but he &s;aw it was ab&s;olutely necessary to yield to the torrent, lest he &s;hould exa&s;perate the nation. He therefore i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, promi&s;ing a reward of two hun|dred pounds to every per&s;on who &s;hould make any new di&s;covery touching the plot, before the twenty-fifth day of December. Oates and Bedloe, though they had often declared that they knew of no per&s;on of di&s;tinction concerned in the plot, except tho&s;e they had already named, now ventured to accu&s;e the queen of being engaged in the de&s;ign again&s;t the life of her hu&s;band; and the commons, in an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;ired that the queen and her dome&s;tics might be immediately removed from the palace of Whitehall. It was well known that Charles had no great affection to the queen; and that her removal would have made way for another con&s;ort, by whom he might have had an heir of his own body, which would have quieted all the fears and jealou&s;ies of tho&s;e who were aver&s;e to a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Neverthele&s;s, he would not aban|don the queen to the rage of a mi&s;guided people. He a&s;&s;ured her &s;he might depend upon his protection. In order to manife&s;t his re&s;entment at the in&s;o|lence of Oates, he commanded him to be &s;trictly guarded. Next day, however, the commons, in an addre&s;s, in&s;i&s;ted upon his being enlarged, and &s;erved by his own dome&s;tics: they likewi&s;e desired his maje&s;ty would grant a competent pen|tion for his &s;ub&s;istence. They voted, that the king &s;hould be addressed, to ca$&s;e all the papists in the kingdom to be arre&s;ted. On the &s;ixth day of De|cember, they impeached, at the bar of the upper hou&s;e, the five lords who were confined in the Tower; but they had not time to pre&s;ent the articles of ac|cu&s;ation.</P>

<P>In the cour&s;e of this month, Ireland and Pickering je&s;uits, with Grove a lay-brother, were tried at the Old Bailey. Thomas Whitebread, provincial of the order, and John Fenwick a member of the &s;ociety, were like|wi&s;e produced at the bar; but their trial was deferred on account of the ab|&s;ence of a principal evidence. Oates depo&s;ed, that Pickering and Grove had bound them&s;elves by an oath, admini&s;tred by Whitebread, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king: that for this purpo&s;e they had provided them&s;elves with &s;crewed pi&s;tols and &s;ilver bullets: that Pickering actually attempted to &s;hoot the king in the park; but his flint was loo&s;e, &s;o that he lo&s;t the opportunity. Bedloe &s;wore that Ire|land, Pickering, and Grove, together with one Conyers a Benedictine monk, undertook to murder the king in his morning walk at Newmarket: that he had heard them declare this re&s;olution, in the lodgings of father Harcourt, where it was determined that Grove &s;hould be gratified with fifteen hundred pounds, and Pickering with as many ma&s;&s;es as the like &s;um would procure: in this particular he agreed with Oates. He likewi&s;e declared, that Knight, Pritchard, O Neale, and O Bryan, were employed to murder the earl of Shaft&s;bury, the duke of Buckingam, the duke of Ormond, and his &s;on the earl of O&s;&s;ory. Grove, in his de$ence, prote&s;ted, that, as he had a &s;oul to be &s;aved, he was utterly ignorant of the whole affair. Pickering &s;aid he had never in his life fired a pi&s;tol; and Whitebread, who was pre&s;ent at the trial, declared, in the pre&s;ence of God, that Oates had not &s;poke three words of truth in his
<PB N="477" REF="4790">
whole depo&s;ition. Ireland denied that he had ever &s;een Bedloe before that day, and de&s;ired him to produce a &s;ingle witne&s;s to prove he had ever been in his company. Pickering affirmed that he was an utter &s;tranger to the per&s;ons of both evidences. When Groves ob&s;erved that he hardly knew Oates by &s;ight, this informer reminded the pri&s;oner of his having told him, that he and three other Iri&s;hmen had &s;et fire to the Borough of Southwark; and that his &s;hare of the reward for this &s;ervice, amounted to four hundred pounds. Ireland offered to prove, by twenty witne&s;&s;es, that he had been in Stafford&s;hire, and Che&s;hire, during the whole month of Augu&s;t, and part of September, the period which the informers had a&s;&s;igned for tho&s;e con&s;ultations: but, as the witne&s;&s;es were not pre&s;ent, the pri&s;oner reaped no benefit from the propo&s;al. Whitebread produced a certificate, under the &s;eal of the college at St. Omer, importing, that Oates had re&s;ided in that place during the months of April and May, although he had &s;worn to his being pre&s;ent at a con&s;ult in London on the twenty-fourth day of April. But this certificate could not be admitted as evi|dence, by the laws of England. In a word, the three pri&s;oners were con|demned, and each prote&s;ted, in his la&s;t moments, that he was as innocent of the crimes laid to his charge, as a child new born.</P>

<P>The oppo&s;ition in the two hou&s;es of parliament was now grown too &s;trong to be controuled; and their animo&s;ity again&s;t the court &s;eemed to in|crea&s;e with their power. The earl of Danby lord trea&s;urer was the chief ob|ject of their re&s;entment. He knew that many members of both hou&s;es were bent upon his de&s;truction; and the per&s;on whom he chiefly dreaded was Mon|tague, who had been amba&s;&s;ador in France, and come over to England, with|out the king's leave, in order to fill a &s;eat he had procured in parliament. The king, at Danby's reque&s;t, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the commons, informing them of his re&s;olution to bring Montague to a trial, for having corre&s;ponded with the pope's nuncio abroad: at the &s;ame time a warrant was granted to &s;ecure his papers. Warm debates aro&s;e in the hou&s;e; and many individuals declared it was a high breach of privilege, to &s;eize the papers of a member again&s;t whom no trea&s;onable practices had been &s;worn. Montague had warily depo&s;ited all his credentials in the hands of a tru&s;ty friend, to whom he now &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger for the whole collection. The box being brought into the hou&s;e, he opened it, and produced two letters from the earl of Danby, directing him to treat with the king of France for &s;ix hundred thou&s;and livres, to be paid annually to the king of England, for three years after the peace of Nimeguen, in con&s;ideration of his favouring the French intere&s;t at the congre&s;s. The hou&s;e was kindled into a violent flame by this intelligence. Winnington the &s;ollicitor-general inveighed again&s;t the earl of Danby, as a mini&s;ter who had been concerned in betraying the intere&s;t of England, and that of her allies, in &s;elling the nation, and &s;ub|verting the government: he therefore moved he might be impeached of high trea&s;on. Notwith&s;tanding a vigorous oppo&s;ition by the earl's friends, who ob&s;erved there was no trea&s;onable fact charged upon him; and that he had done nothing but writ letters by the king's order; it was re&s;olved, by a majo|rity of votes, that the earl of Danby &s;hould be impeached; and in two days the articles were &s;ent up to the hou&s;e of lords.</P>

<P>He was accu&s;ed of having given in&s;tructions to his maje&s;ty's amba&s;|&s;adors, without the privity of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, or of the council: of
<PB N="478" REF="4800">
having endeavoured to &s;ubvert the government, and introduce arbitrary power: of having negotiated a di&s;advantageous peace with France, and &s;old the intere&s;t of the nation: of being popi&s;hly affected: of having concealed the late horrid plot contrived by the papi&s;ts: of having wa&s;ted the public trea&s;ure, and ob|tained by indirect means &s;everal exorbitant grants from the crown. The earl of Danby was extremely embarra&s;&s;ed by &s;ome of the&s;e articles, which he could not an&s;wer in his own ju&s;tification, without accu&s;ing the king, who had begged he would not divulge his &s;ecret negotiations. He recriminated upon Monta|gue as the per&s;on who had advi&s;ed and &s;et on foot tho&s;e private treaties; and to prove this a&s;&s;ertion, &s;ent two of that mini&s;ter's letters to the hou&s;e of commons, who would not &s;uffer them to be read. He ob&s;erved, in the hou&s;e of lords, That the French mini&s;try had always looked upon him as an enemy to the intere&s;t of their nation: that he had exerted uncommon diligence in tracing out the con|&s;piracy: and, that he had wa&s;ted no trea&s;ure, ina&s;much as there was none to wa&s;te. He likewi&s;e in&s;inuated, that it was in his power to vindicate his own conduct in &s;uch a manner as would clear him of every article of the imputation. Granting all the allegations in the impeachment to be true, there was not one that amounted to high trea&s;on; and therefore the lords refu&s;ed to commit him to the Tower. The commons in&s;i&s;ted upon his being taken into cu&s;tody: a conte&s;t en&s;ued; and the king dreading &s;ome fatal con&s;equence from the violence of the lower hou&s;e, prorogued the parliament, which he afterwards di&s;&s;olved. At the &s;ame time he i&s;&s;ued writs, convoking another for the &s;ixth day of March. Charles found it was high time to put an end to this a&s;&s;embly, which had con|tinued &s;ince the &s;econd year of his reign. Their former complai&s;ance and con|fidence<NOTE PLACE="marg">B$rnet.

They were grown not only unmanageable, but even dangerous to his government; and &s;eemed to tread in the &s;teps of the long-parliament that ruined his father. It mu&s;t be owned however, that this change was in a great mea&s;ure owing to his own mi&s;conduct.</P>

<P>On the twenty-fir&s;t day of December, Miles Prance a gold&s;mith, who profe&s;&s;ed the Roman catholic religion, was apprehended on &s;u&s;picion of having been concerned in the murder of Sir Edmund&s;bury Godfrey. The in|former was one Wren who had lodged at his hou&s;e, and &s;wore, that his land|lord had been ab&s;ent for &s;everal nights about the time at which the murder was committed. Prance being brought before the committee of lords at We&s;tmin|&s;ter, denied the charge with the deepe&s;t imprecations; but Bedloe being pre&s;ent, and affirming that this was one of the men whom he had &s;een with the dead<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch$ 1$$$.</NOTE> body in Somer&s;et Hou&s;e; he was committed to Newgate, loaded with irons, and confined in the condemned hole, which was cold, dark, damp, and almo&s;t intolerably offen&s;ive. There the poor wretch lay in all the horrour of de&s;pair, groaning, &s;hrieking, and exclaiming that he was not guilty. Next day, he de&s;ired he might be carried before the earl of Shaft&s;bury, who was pre&s;ident of the committee. This nobleman is &s;aid to have employed reproach and dreadful threats upon this mi&s;erable object, already half dead with fear, to extort an ac+cu&s;ation again&s;t the catholics. At length, he di&s;covered &s;ome particulars, and promi&s;ed to make a more ample confe&s;&s;ion, if he could be a&s;&s;ured of pardon. This being obtained, he was examined in Newgate by a committee of both hou&s;es, and afterwards brought to Whitehall before the king and council. There he
<PB N="479" REF="4810">
declared that Godfrey had been murdered in Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, by the contrivance of Gerald and Kelly two Iri&s;h prie&s;ts, Robert Green cu&s;hion-keeper of the queen's chapel, Lawrence Hill footman to doctor Godden trea&s;urer of the chapel, and Henry Berry porter of Somer&s;et-palace. The next time Prance ap|peared before the council, he begged a private audience of the king, which being granted, he fell upon his knees, and declared, as he hoped for &s;alvation, that his confe&s;&s;ion was totally fal&s;e. He &s;aid, he was unacquainted with Bedloe, and utterly ignorant of the murder as well as of the con&s;piracy; but that Wren had informed again&s;t him in revenge for his having demanded the rent of his lodgings. Being &s;ent back to his mi&s;erable apartment in Newgate, intimidated by the goaler, and expo&s;ed to the tyranny of the committee, he &s;ent the keeper to tell the king, that his fir&s;t depo&s;ition was true; and this he afterwards re|tracted. Doctor Loyd vi&s;iting him by the king's command, found him half dead with cold and terror. This humane clergyman ordered a fire to be made, and a bed to be provided for him; then he avowed his confe&s;&s;ion in &s;uch a man|ner as convinced the doctor of his &s;incerity. Perhaps, when he retracted his fir&s;t depo&s;ition, he hoped the king would have taken him under his immediate protection; but, finding him&s;elf &s;till at the mercy of the committee, he hazarded his &s;oul rather than endure the hard&s;hips to which his body was &s;ubjected.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XIII.</HEAD>
<P>His confe&s;&s;ion contained the following particulars. Hill, Gerald, and Green, in con&s;equence of a con&s;ultation with Kelly, Berry, and Prance, un|dertook to di&s;patch Sir Edmund&s;bury Godfrey, as a violent per&s;ecutor of the Roman catholics, and a declared enemy of the queen's &s;ervants. On the twelfth day of October, they followed him at a di&s;tance, from ten in the morn|ing till &s;even in the evening, when he entered a hou&s;e in the neighbourhood of St. Clement's church, where he &s;tayed till nine. When he arrived at the water-gate of Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, in his way homewards, Kelly and Berry feigned a quarrel, and Hill prevailed upon Godfrey to interpo&s;e as a ju&s;tice of the peace. With difficulty he was prevailed upon to enter the gate, when Green throwing a twi&s;ted handkerchief over his head, fixed it round his neck, and the re&s;t falling upon him at the &s;ame time, he was immediately &s;trangled; they knocked upon his brea&s;t with their knees, and twi&s;ted his neck until it was quite di&s;located. The body was carried to a high chamber in the hou&s;e of Dr. Godden, in which it lay two nights, and then it was removed to another apartment, where it was &s;een by Bedloe. They &s;hifted it to a third place, and even brought it back to the room in which it had been at fir&s;t depo&s;ited. Having kept it four days and four nights, they determined to convey it into the fields, with the rings on the fingers, and the money in the pockets; and to thru&s;t the &s;word through it, that the public might believe Sir Edmund&s;bury had made away with him&s;elf. They accordingly brought a &s;edan chair into the court, and the body being placed in it, was at midnight carried by them to Soho: there Hill waited for them with a hor&s;e, upon which it was mounted before him, and they proceeded to Primro&s;e-Hill, where they left it in a ditch, after Gerald had thru&s;t the &s;word into it, and laid it in a proper attitude.</P>

<P>Berry, Green, and Hill, were upon the evidence of Prance and Bed|loe, convicted of this murder, in &s;pite of the mo&s;t manife&s;t contradictions in the depo&s;itions of the two witne&s;&s;es, the different evidence given by each at different times, and the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umptions in favour of the accu&s;ed. The&s;e unhappy
<PB N="480" REF="4820">
men brought witne&s;&s;es to prove that they were at home and in bed at the time in which they were &s;aid to be employed in removing the body. The centinels who &s;tood that night at the gate of Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, depo&s;ed, that no &s;edan was brought out of the palace. The people who lived in Godden's lodings, declared upon oath, that no dead body could po&s;&s;ibly be brought into the hou&s;e without their knowledge; and that they were every day in the room which Prance de|&s;cribed, without &s;eeing any thing of that nature. Green and Hill died, prote&s;t|ing their innocence, as they hoped for mercy at the judgment-&s;eat of God. Berry profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a prote&s;tant, and died like a devout chri&s;tian, denying his having been privy in any &s;hape to the murder; though he might have &s;aved his life by making a confe&s;&s;ion. Oates, Bedloe, and Prance, were undoubtedly fal&s;e informers, and Berry, Green, and Hill, in all probability, innocent. But, certain it is, Sir Ed|mund&s;bury Godfrey was murdered; and the &s;u&s;picion naturally falls upon the Roman catholics. Perhaps he was di&s;patched by the direction of tho&s;e who did not know the particulars of the information to the truth of which Titus Oates had &s;worn before him; but, were apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome di&s;covery that might be fatal to the catholic intere&s;t. The &s;tory of his death, as related by Prance, with the circum&s;tances of his body's being removed from one apartment to another, conveyed in a &s;edan, and mounted on hor&s;eback, is altogether improbable. They might have &s;tripped him of his money and rings, and thrown him into the river, without running any ri&s;que of being di&s;covered; whereas the method de|&s;cribed by Prance was the mo&s;t dangerous they could have devi&s;ed. If they were de&s;irous of impo&s;ing upon the world with re&s;pect to the manner of his death, a &s;ingle man might have carried out the body in a hamper, without the lea&s;t hazard of detection. Be&s;ides, the cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned for murdering him, was ab&s;olutely without foundation. He was an enemy to all per&s;ecution, and lived upon good terms with the catholics; in&s;omuch that he warned Coleman of his danger, and coun&s;elled him to retire before he was publicly accu&s;ed. The drops of wax upon his breeches &s;eemed to indicate, that he had been &s;trangled by the light of tapers, which were u&s;ed only by per&s;ons of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion, and popi&s;h prie&s;ts at their wor&s;hip. At this period, Stephen Dugdale who had been &s;teward to lord A&s;hton$ offered him&s;elf as an evidence to make further di&s;coveries concerning the con&s;piracy. He affirmed, that two hundred thou&s;and papi&s;ts were ready to take arms in England, and accu&s;ed five je&s;uits and a prie&s;t, again&s;t whom the king i&s;&s;ued a proclamation; but all of them e&s;caped, except Gav$n$ who was taken and impri&s;oned.</P>

<P>Charles exerted his utmo&s;t endeavours to influence the elections for the new parliament; but, the &s;pirit of the times was &s;uch as defeated all his efforts. Almo&s;t all the active men in the kingdom were enemies to the court; and the people were &s;o in&s;atuated by the rumours of plots and con&s;piracies ha$$ned by the papi&s;ts, that their re&s;entment confounded the king with the catholics, though$ according to all the informations hitherto publi&s;hed, the immediate purpo&s;e of the con$pirators was to remove the king by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. The pre&s;byterians be&s;tirred them&s;elves with incredible ardour on this occa&s;ion. They bore the chief &s;way in corporations, and even introduced the practice of &s;plitting freeholds, in order to multiply votes for members. In a word, Charles had the mortification to fore$$e that the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition would revive with double violence in this new parliament. In order to avert part of the &s;torm
<PB N="481" REF="4830">
with which he was threatened, he removed the duke of York from his pre&s;ence$ and that prince, in obedience to a written order, retired with his dutche&s;s and daughter Anne to Bru&s;&s;els. The king likewi&s;e ordered a pardon to be expedited in favour of the earl of Danby, le&s;t his enemies &s;hould renew the pro&s;ecution again&s;t that mini&s;ter$ and the fear of death compel him to di&s;cover his maje&s;ty's &s;ecrets. In his &s;peech to the new parliament, the king mentioned the pains he had taken in puni&s;hing the con&s;pirators, and the murderers of Godfrey. He made a merit of having removed his brother from the kingdom; and he demanded &s;up|plies, as well for di&s;banding the army as for maintaining the navy. The com|mons having cho&s;en Edward Seymour for their &s;peaker, the king rejected their choice; and an ob&s;tinate di&s;pute en&s;ued. They pretended that the new &s;peak|er's being pre&s;ented for the king's approbation was a meer form; and he main|tained that he had a right to di&s;approve of their choice, without di&s;clo&s;ing the cau&s;e of his di&s;approbation. The que&s;tion could not be decided by precedent: at length, the affair was compromi&s;ed; and one Gregory a lawyer being elected by the hou&s;e, was confirmed by the king. On the twentieth day of March, the hou&s;e appointed a &s;ecret committee for preparing evidence again&s;t the lords who were in the Tower, and for receiving further information with regard to the con&s;piracy and the murder of Godfrey. Then they began to prepare new articles of impeachment again&s;t the earl of Danby.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XVI.</HEAD>
<P>They &s;ummoned Tongue, Oates, Bedloe, and one Everard, a new witne&s;s, to the bar of the hou&s;e, to be examined concerning the plot. They ad|dre&s;&s;ed the king to gratify Bedloe with a reward of five hundred pounds, which he had promi&s;ed, by proclamation, to the per&s;on who &s;hould fir&s;t di&s;cover the murderers of Godfrey; and to commend him to the protection of the duke of Monmouth general of the forces. They voted, That an horrible con&s;piracy had been hatched by the papi&s;ts for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the king, de&s;troying the pro|te&s;tant religion, and &s;ubverting the government: the peers concurred with them in this vote; and both hou&s;es petitioned for a day of fa&s;t and humiliation. The king going to the hou&s;e of lords, interceded with the parliament for the earl of Danby. He &s;aid that nobleman had acted in obedience to the orders he received: that for their &s;atisfaction he would deprive him of all his employ|ments, and remove him from his pre&s;ence; but, he in&s;i&s;ted upon the pardon he had granted. The commons were not at all &s;atisfied with this declaration. The hou&s;es were filled with Danby's enemies; and the commons were wholly influenced by Shaft&s;bury, who equally hated the king, the duke, and the trea|&s;urer, with implacable rancour. The de&s;ign was to extort &s;ecrets of &s;tate, the di&s;|covery of which would reflect di&s;grace upon his maje&s;ty's character. The pardon, if valid, mu&s;t defeat this purpo&s;e. The commons &s;ent a committee to know of the chancellor in what manner the pardon had been &s;ealed: then they under|&s;tood that the king had withdrawn the &s;eals from his cu&s;tody for the time, that he might be &s;creened from all blame. The whole hou&s;e was in commotion. Nothing was heard but the mo&s;t virulent invectives again&s;t the earl of Danby. Shaft&s;bury among the peers exhau&s;ted all his eloquence in &s;tigmati&s;ing the go|vernment. He &s;aid popery and &s;lavery were two brothers that walked hand in hand, &s;ometimes the one and &s;ometimes the other entered fir&s;t; but, they never parted: that in England popery would enter fir&s;t to pave the way to &s;lavery; but, in Scotland, &s;lavery had taken the lead, and popery would follow. Danby
<PB N="482" REF="4840">
having withdrawn him&s;elf, the commons brought in a bill, obliging him to &s;urrender him&s;elf into the hands of ju&s;tice by a certain day, on pain of being proceesed again&s;t by an act of attainder. This bill was &s;ent down from the lords with &s;ome amendments: a di&s;pute aro&s;e, and conferences were held upon the &s;ubject: at length$ the peers acquie&s;ced and the bill pa&s;&s;ed. Then the earl of Danby &s;urrendered him&s;elf to the u&s;her of the black-rod, and was committed pri&s;oner to the Tower.</P>

<P>Charles was now reduced to great perplexity. He &s;aw his autho|rity already di&s;regarded, and ran the ri&s;que of being di&s;graced by the di&s;coveries of Danby. In this emergency he con&s;ulted Sir William Temple, who advi&s;ed him to weaken the oppo&s;ition, by admitting the chiefs of it into his council. He forthwith tried the expedient. The earl of E&s;&s;ex, a con&s;cientious nobleman, was created lord trea&s;urer in the room of Danby: the office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate was be&s;towed upon the earl of Sunderland, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a good capacity, and a talent for intrigue. Lord Hallifax, celebrated for his genius, learning, and eloquence, was likewi&s;e &s;worn of the council; and the&s;e three, together with Sir William Temple, were fir&s;t con&s;ulted in all affairs of importance. Shaft&s;|bury was declared pre&s;ident of the council; but, finding him&s;elf excluded in|tirely from the king's confidence, he &s;till adhered to the popular party, over whom he retained all his former influence. The city of London, and the king|dom in general, were overjoyed at this promotion, which &s;eemed to progno&s;ti|cate a change of mea&s;ures; but, the king's intimation of it was received with great indifference by the hou&s;e of commons. All the art and intrigue of Shafts|bury was employed in keeping up the flame of animo&s;ity again&s;t the king and his brother. The hou&s;e of one Bird being &s;et on fire by his maid-&s;ervant Eli|zabeth Oakely, &s;he confe&s;&s;ed &s;he had been in&s;tigated to commit that crime by one Stubbs a catholic; and he being que&s;tioned, owned that father Gifford his confe&s;&s;or had a&s;&s;ured him there was no &s;in in burning the hou&s;es of heretics. He and Oakely declared, that the catholics in England intended to ri&s;e in arms, and expected to be joined by an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men from France. The commons immediately addre&s;&s;ed the king for the execution of Pickering and the other condemned je&s;uits. They even a&s;&s;embled on Sunday, to concert mea&s;ures for the pre&s;ervation of the king's per&s;on, and the prote&s;tant religion again&s;t the attempts of the papi&s;ts. They brought in a bill for bani&s;hing all Roman catholics from London: they voted, That the duke's being a Roman catholic, and the pre&s;umptive heir of the crown, was the chief encouragement to the de&s;igns and plots of the papi&s;ts, again&s;t the king and the prote&s;tant religion.</P>

<P>On the twenty-fifth of April, the earl of Danby being brought to the bar of the upper hou&s;e, pleaded his pardon, and was reconveyed to the Tower. A committee of the commons being appointed to examine the nature of this defence$ reported, That there was no example of any per&s;on's having pleaded a pardon in bar of an impeachment. Then the lower hou&s;e de&s;ired the lords to a&s;k if the earl would in&s;i&s;t wholly upon his pardon. When this que&s;|tion was put, he de&s;ired time to con&s;ider of a reply, and was indulged with four days for that purpo&s;e. The king, in an&s;wer to the addre&s;s of the commons for the execution of the per&s;ons under &s;entence of death, ob&s;erved, that he had been always &s;crupulous of &s;hedding blood; that he would take time to deliberate
<PB N="483" REF="4850">
maturely on their reque&s;t, and make them acquainted with his &s;entiments on the &s;ubject. Being &s;hocked at their vote again&s;t his brother, he, after a &s;hort &s;peech to both hou&s;es, on the thirtieth day of April, de&s;ired they would u&s;e ex|pedition in tracing out the particulars of the con&s;piracy, as well as in devi&s;ing ways and means for di&s;banding the army, and maintaining a fleet for the defence of the kingdom. Then he told them, that as a mark of his care for the pre&s;er|vation of their religion, he had ordered the chancellor to communicate certain propo&s;als for their con&s;ideration. Accordingly, the chancellor, in his maje&s;ty's name, propo&s;ed the following limitations upon a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or: That it &s;hould not be in his power to be&s;tow eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices or &s;piritual offices upon any but pious and learned prote&s;tants: That the parliament &s;itting at the death of the king &s;hould continue for a certain time; or in ca&s;e there &s;hould be no parliament at that juncture, the la&s;t &s;hould a&s;&s;emble without any new writs of elections: That, in the reign of a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or, no members of the privy-council, or judges, &s;hould be appointed or di&s;placed but by the authority of parliament; and that all ju&s;tices of the peace &s;hould be prote&s;tants: That, with re&s;pect to the militia, no lieutenant of a county &s;hould be deprived of his office but by order of parliament. The chancellor &s;aid it would be difficult to conceive how the power of a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or could be more effectually limited, con&s;idering how much his revenues would depend upon the parliament: never|thele&s;s, if they could add any thing for the &s;ecurity of religion and liberty, without de&s;troying the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the king would willingly a&s;&s;ent to their propo&s;al.</P>

<P>The commons, without paying the lea&s;t regard to the&s;e offers, pro|ceeded with the bill for preventing the dangers that might ari&s;e from popery, in the reign of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, as well as in his &s;ucce&s;&s;or's; and they ordered another to be brought in for vacating the &s;eats of tho&s;e members who &s;hould accept of any employment under the crown. On the fifth day of May, the hou&s;e in a body demanded of the peers, that the earl of Danby &s;hould be brought to his trial. Then they pre&s;ented a long addre&s;s to the king again&s;t the duke of Lauderdale; and they fini&s;hed the money-bill for enabling the king to di&s;band the army. This act contained a clau&s;e, importing, That for the future, &s;oldiers &s;hould not be quartered in private hou&s;es. The lords, by a me&s;&s;age, informed the lower hou&s;e of their having fixed a day for hearing council upon the validity of Danby's pardon, which the commons had declared null and of no effect. They were incen&s;ed at this me&s;&s;age, and in&s;tantly voted, That any per&s;on pre|&s;uming to defend the validity of Danby's pardon, &s;hould be deemed a betrayer of the liberties of the nation. They were now re&s;olved to proceed to extremi|ties; they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, repre&s;enting, That London and We&s;tmin&s;ter were over-run with papi&s;ts; and demanding, That the militia &s;hould be armed. Next day being Sunday, they ordered a bill to be brought in for rendering the duke of York incapable of &s;ucceeding to the throne of Eng|land. In an addre&s;s to the king, they declared they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him with their whole power; and in ca&s;e he &s;hould die a violent death, wreak their vengeance upon the catholics.</P>

<P>The committee of both hou&s;es meeting to deliberate upon the manner in which they &s;hould proceed with the trial of the five lords that were pri&s;oners in the Tower, the commons in&s;i&s;ted upon excluding the bi&s;hops, as tho&s;e were
<PB N="484" REF="4860">
ca&s;es in which life was concerned. The lords, on the other hand, alledged, That the prelates had a right to be pre&s;ent at all the proceedings, except the $word$ This difference produced a learned di&s;pute, and many writings were published on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion. On the fifteenth day of May, the commons read, for the fir&s;t time, the bill of exclu&s;ion, to render the duke of York incapable of &s;ucceeding to the throne of England. In this famous bill, they a&s;&s;erted, That the pope's emi&s;&s;aries had &s;educed James duke of York, the pre&s;umptive heir of the crown: That they had converted him to the catholic religion, engaged him in divers negotiations with the pope, cardinals, and nun|cios, for the intere&s;t of that communion: That by his means they had aug|mented the greatne&s;s of the French king, to the manife&s;t danger of England: and, That by the acce&s;&s;ion of a popi&s;h prince to the throne, &s;upported by foreign alliances, they would in time be enabled to execute their damnable enterprize. The propo&s;ed act therefore ordained, by the authority of the king and the two hou&s;es, That the &s;aid James duke of York, Albany, and Ul&s;ter, &s;hould be in|capable of inheriting the crowns of England, Scotland, and Ireland, with their dependencies: or of enjoying the rights, titles, prerogatives, and revenues of the &s;aid crowns: That, in ca&s;e of the king's death or re&s;ignation, they &s;hould de|volve to the next per&s;on in the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as if the duke of York were dead: That all the acts of &s;overeignty or royalty exerci&s;ed by him, &s;hould be null and puni&s;hable as trea&s;on: That all per&s;ons attempting to put him in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of any one of tho&s;e kingdoms, or corre&s;ponding with him for this pur|po&s;e, &s;hould be deemed guilty of high trea&s;on: That he him&s;elf, upon &s;etting foot in the&s;e kingdoms, &s;hould be held guilty of the &s;ame crime: and all per|&s;ons were authori&s;ed to apprehend, impri&s;on; and, in ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance, &s;ubdue him and his adherents by force of arms. This bill was read for the &s;econd time; and the que&s;tion being put, whether it &s;hould be referred to the exami|nation of a committee of the whole hou&s;e, it was carried in the affirmative by a majority of &s;eventy-nine voices.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXI.</HEAD>
<P>The next &s;tep of the commons was, to &s;et on foot a &s;evere in|quiry again&s;t tho&s;e members who received pen&s;ions from court; and eighteen were di&s;covered. The &s;tanding army and the guards were voted illegal; and they brought in the bill of Habeas corpus, which was pa&s;&s;ed into an act before the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. This is one great bulwark of Briti&s;h liberty, obliging the judge, under &s;evere penalties, to grant a writ of Habeas corpus, at the reque&s;t of every pri&s;oner, directing the gaoler to produce him in court, and certify the cau&s;e of his commitment. The king had for &s;ome time entertained thoughts of proroguing the parliament; but, now his re&s;olution was quickened by a hint of intelligence, importing, that the commons intended to draw up a remon|&s;trance upon the grievances of the nation, like that which was pre&s;ented to his father before the commencement of the civil war. Alarmed by this informa|tion, he repaired to the hou&s;e of peers on the twenty-&s;eventh of May, and &s;ending for the commons, prorogued the parliament to the fourteenth day of Augu&s;t. It was afterwards di&s;&s;olved, without the advice of council; and writs were i&s;&s;ued for new elections. This was a de&s;perate remedy, which Charles would not have u&s;ed, had not he thought his &s;ervant's life was at &s;take, and his own crown in danger. He found him&s;elf at variance with a &s;et of people whom he
<PB N="485" REF="4870">
could neither intimidate nor appea&s;e; he became pen&s;ive and fullen, and his temper vi&s;ibly changed from this period.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; XXII.</HEAD>
<P>After the prorogation, the five je&s;uits, namely Whitebread the provincial, Fenwick, Harcourt, Gavan, and Turner, were brought to trial. Oates depo&s;ed that Whitebread pre&s;ided at the con&s;ultation, in which it was re&s;olved to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king; and that the re&s;t were a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the &s;ame de&s;ign. Dugdale, the new informer, &s;wore that he had &s;een a letter, in the hand-writing of Whitebread to father Ewers, de&s;iring him to choo&s;e bold and faithful per&s;ons to murder the king; and that he had read an hundred letters to different people on the &s;ame &s;ubject. Con&s;idering the craft and circum&s;pection of the je&s;uits, this circum&s;tance is almo&s;t incredible. He likewi&s;e depo&s;ed, that Harcourt wrote an account of Godfrey's death to Ewers, in Stafford&s;hire, on the very night in which that magi&s;trate was murdered; &s;o that it was known in the country &s;ome days before the body was di&s;covered at Primero&s;e-hill. Prance affirmed, that Harcourt told him, there was a de&s;ign on foot to take away the king's life; and that Fenwick &s;aid, fifty thou&s;and men were ready to take arms, under the command of the lords Bella&s;is, Powis, and Arundel. Bedloe declared, that he had heard the pri&s;oners di&s;cour&s;ing with Coleman about &s;end|ing four ru$$ians to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king at Wind&s;or: that he &s;aw Harcourt take four&s;core or an hundred guineas out of a che&s;t, for the u&s;e of tho&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins: that, at another time, this je&s;uit delivered an order for two thou&s;and pounds, as part of a greater &s;um, to Sir George Wakeman, the queen's phy&s;ician, who &s;aid that fifteen thou&s;and pounds would be but an indifferent reward for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing religion, and preventing the ruin of three kingdoms. The unhappy pri&s;oners ob&s;erved, in their own defence, that the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t them were per&s;ons of de&s;perate fortunes and infamous characters; that it was very impro|bable they &s;hould communicate &s;ecrets of this nature to Oates, who had been expelled from St. Omer for &s;candalous practices, and even excluded from the &s;acrament. They enumerated the &s;elf-contradictions that appeared in his evi|dence: they produced &s;ixteen witne&s;&s;es of credit, &s;tudents at St. Omer, and chiefly &s;ons of reputable parents, who &s;wore that Oates was in the &s;eminary during the time at which he &s;aid the con&s;ultation was held in London. Eleven other witne&s;&s;es declared upon oath, that Ireland, who had been executed, was in the country at the time of tho&s;e pretended con&s;ultations, though Oates had &s;worn he was in town; and, in con&s;equence of that depo&s;ition, the man had lo&s;t his life. Oates, indeed, provided him&s;elf with &s;ix or &s;even evidences, who declared they &s;aw him in London at the time to which he had &s;worn; and, among the re&s;t, one Smith, a &s;chool-ma&s;ter at I&s;lington, upon who&s;e credit he chiefly depended. The&s;e circum&s;tances were &s;uppo&s;ed to invalidate the te&s;timony of &s;ixteen papi&s;ts, whom even Scroggs the judge had di&s;countenanced and ridiculed: yet Smith retracted his evidence in the &s;equel. Gavan was &s;o weak as to de&s;ire that his innocence might be proved by the ordeal$ in that ca&s;e, indeed, there would have been a po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping; whereas there was none in the com|mon form of trial before &s;uch a judge and jury.</P>

<P>They were immediately convicted; though &s;entence was not pro|nounced till after the trial of Langhorn the lawyer, who was accu&s;ed by the &s;ame evidences as a principal agent in the con&s;piracy. He objected to the credit of &s;uch infamous witne&s;&s;es who had received pardon, and recompence for betraying
<PB N="486" REF="4880">
their fellow-&s;ubjects. Oates declared, that in&s;tead of receiving a recompence, he had &s;pent &s;ix or &s;even hundred pounds of his own money. Bedloc likewi&s;e affirmed, that he was &s;even hundred pounds in advance. Langhorn ob&s;erved the improbability of the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, con&s;idering that when they fir&s;t appeared they were in extreme indigence. He in&s;i&s;ted upon the evidence by which Oates had been proved perjured; but the judge gave him to under&s;tand, that he could not reject an evidence as perjured, until he was formally convicted of perjury. Oates had &s;worn that he lodged in the hou&s;e of Grove, at the time of the great con&s;ultation; Grove's wife and &s;ervant depo&s;ed, that he did not. The judge ob&s;erved, that, being in di&s;gui&s;e, he might have lodged there without being known. The witne&s;&s;es for the pri&s;oner were in&s;ulted by the court, and mal|treated by the people. One of them was hurt, to the imminent danger of his life. A woman declared &s;he could not give evidence, unle&s;s the court would promi&s;e to protect her. The judge told her, all he could do, was to puni&s;h tho&s;e by whom &s;he might be a&s;&s;aulted: Langhorn, rather than &s;he &s;hould run the ri&s;que of her life, waved her te&s;timony. When he was convicted, the bar|barous multitude te&s;tified their joy by loud acclamations. He and the je&s;uits received &s;entence of death, and prote&s;ted their innocence to the la&s;t moment of their lives. Whitebread, in particular, declared his abhorrence of all equivo|cation, and of the maxim e&s;pou&s;ed by &s;ome je&s;uits, touching the lawfulne&s;s of depo&s;ing and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating princes.</P>

<P>The humane reader cannot, without horror, reflect upon the fate of tho&s;e unhappy per&s;ons, who fell a &s;acrifice to the &s;avage prejudice of the multitude, excited by the villainy of the mo&s;t abandoned mi&s;creants; and in|flamed by the arts of a malignant faction. By this time, however, the populace began to be gorged with blood: the rage of their re&s;entment had exhau&s;ted it&s;elf. The prote&s;tations, the compo&s;ure, and pious deportment of the &s;ufferers, made impre&s;&s;ion upon the minds of all who retained the lea&s;t &s;entiment of humanity; and now they began to reflect upon the characters of the informers and the ab&s;urdities of their information; which, in the hurry and precipitation of their vengeance, they had wholly overlooked. On the eighteenth day of June, the chief ju&s;tice proceeded to the trial of Sir George Wakeman, the queen's phy&s;ician. Oates had &s;aid, at his fir&s;t examination, that he knew no|thing again&s;t this per&s;on but by hear&s;ay; yet now he &s;wore he had &s;een a letter from him to A&s;hby the je&s;uit, advi&s;ing him to u&s;e a milk-diet, and be pumped at the Bath: and likewi&s;e expre&s;&s;ing his zeal for the de&s;ign of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating or poi&s;oning the king. He then repeated his former accu&s;ation of the queen. Wakeman reminded the judge of the informer's &s;olemn declaration that he knew nothing again&s;t him but by hear&s;ay. He proved, by his own &s;ervant, and the apothecary at the Bath, that he did not write, but dictate, the paper &s;ent to A&s;hby; and that nothing could be more ab&s;urd than to pre&s;cribe a milk|diet with the u&s;e of the Bath-water. Bedloe prevaricated &s;candalou&s;ly in his evidence again&s;t this phy&s;ician; who, together with three Benedictine monks tried at the &s;ame time, were acquitted by the jury. Oates and Bedloe, per|ceiving their credit was now entirely bla&s;ted, loudly taxed the chief ju&s;tice, Scroggs, with partiality; becau&s;e he acted in the&s;e trials with unu&s;ual moderation.

<P>In Scotland the duke of Lauderdale's intere&s;t declined apace. He had been accu&s;ed before the council of England, by the duke of Hamilton, and &s;everal other noblemen, who proved him guilty of the mo&s;t arbitrary and ty|rannicabadmini&s;tration. His memory had begun to fail him, and the king was de&s;irous of letting him fall gently; being re&s;olved to ve&s;t the government of Scotland in the hands of the duke of Monmouth, who was now the minion of the people. At pre&s;ent it was &s;o relaxed, and the di&s;tractions in England were &s;o well known, that the covenanters rejected all re&s;traint, and took arms in defence of their conventicles. They hated Sharpe, archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's, with the mo&s;t implacable enmity, as an apo&s;tate, and per&s;ecutor of God's people. A troop of the&s;e armed fanatics, chancing to meet this prelate and his daughter, in his coach, upon a heath in the neighbourhood of St. Andrew's, dragged him from the carriage; and, without paying the lea&s;t regard to the cries and intreaties of his daughter, murdered him in the mo&s;t barbarous man|ner. This cruel a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination was celebrated by the covenanters as an exploit meritorious in the &s;ight of God. They became more and more in&s;olent and enterprizing. They publi&s;hed a declaration again&s;t prelacy, and burned &s;eve|ral acts of parliament in the market-place of Rutherglen, a &s;mall borough near Gla&s;gow. Captain Graham, afterwards lord Dundee, attacked one of their conventicles, and was repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of thirty men. They now re&s;olved to try their fortune in the field. They took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gla&s;gow; expelled the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy; i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, declaring, they had taken up arms again&s;t the king's &s;upremacy, popery, prelacy, and a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The king was no &s;ooner informed of this in&s;urrection, than he di&s;patched Monmouth with &s;ome troops of Engli&s;h cavalry to Scotland. The&s;e being joined by the Scotti&s;h guards, and &s;ome regiments of militia, marched again&s;t the in&s;urgents, who were po&s;ted at Bothwel-bridge, between Gla&s;gow and Hamilton, to the number of eight thou&s;and, commanded by their mini&s;ters. They defended the bridge until their ammunition was expended: then they retired; and Monmouth pa&s;&s;ing, drew up his forces without oppo&s;ition. They could not &s;tand the fire of his artillery; but immediately fled in confu&s;ion. Seven hundred were kil|led in the pur&s;uit, and twelve hundred taken pri&s;oners. The duke treated them with great lenity. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed tho&s;e who promi&s;ed to live peaceably un|der the government. Three hundred, who rejected this condition, were em|barked for the plantations, and peri&s;hed in the voyage. The duke of Mon|mouth was naturally brave and merciful; but he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have courted popularity on this occa&s;ion. He had married a Scotti&s;h lady, the rich heire&s;s of Buccleugh, allied to all the chief nobility, and hoped to &s;ucceed the duke of Lauderdale in all his influence. He prevailed upon the king to grant an act of indemnity in favour of tho&s;e poor wretches who had been harra&s;&s;ed and hunted into rebellion by the &s;everity of the government; but Lauderdale took care to draw it up in &s;uch a manner, that it &s;eemed rather a full pardon to him and all his adherents, than an indulgence to the "intercommuned" covenanters.</P>

<P>In the latter end of Augu&s;t the king was taken ill of an intermit|ting fever at Wind&s;or. This being thought dangerous by the phy&s;ician, Charles, with the privity of E&s;&s;ex, Sunderland, and Hallifax, &s;ent a courier for the duke

of York, who returned privately to England; but, before he reached $word$ the king was recovered. The duke of Monmouth had re&s;igned him&s;elf to the management of Shaftsbury, and &s;eemed to a&s;pire at the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown. He was highly favoured by the king, and idolized by the people$ neverthele&s;s, the duke of York, being &s;upported with the intere&s;t of the ear$s of E$$ex and Hallifax, refu&s;ed to return to the continent until Monmouth was deprived of his commi&s;&s;ion, and ordered to quit the kingdom. This great point being gained, the duke of York retired again to Bru&s;&s;els; but he &s;oon obtained leave to re&s;ide in Scotland, that he might have an opportunity of con|ciliating the affections of that people, and be at hand, in ca&s;e of his brother's decea&s;e.</P>

<P>Before he left England, he had prevailed upon the king to po&s;t|pone the meeting of the new parliament by prorogation. He hoped, that as the nation began to cool, his right to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion would regain the ground it had left. Be&s;ides, he had &s;ome expectation from a new plot, which he thought would tran$late the odium from the catholics to the pre&s;byterians. One Danger|field, more infamous (if po&s;&s;ible) than Oates and Bedloe, a wretch who had been &s;et in the pillory, &s;courged, branded, and tran&s;ported for fraud, felony, and co$ing$ h$tched a plot, in conjunction with a midwife called Cellier, a Roman catholic of abandoned morals. They were &s;aid to be encouraged by the earl of Ca$$lemain, the counte&s;s of Powis, and the five popi&s;$ lords in the Tower. Dangerfield declared there was a de&s;ign on foot to &s;et up a new form of govern|ment, and remove the king, with the royal family. He communicated this in|telligence to the king and the duke of York, who &s;upplied him with money, and $word$ his di&s;covery. He hid &s;ome &s;editious papers in the $word$ of one c$lo$el Man&s;el, and then brought cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers into the apartments to &s;earch for &s;muggled merchandize. The papers were found; and the council having examined the affair, concluded they were forged by Danger|field. They ordered all the places he frequented to be &s;earched; and, in the hou&s;e of Cellier, the whole &s;cheme of the con&s;piracy was di&s;covered upon paper, concealed in a meal-tub, whence it acquired the name of the Meal-tub plot. Dangerfield, being committed to Newgate, made an ample confe&s;&s;ion of the forgery, which he &s;aid was contrived by the earl of Ca&s;tlemain, the coun|te&s;s of Powis, and the five lords in the Tower: that the de&s;ign was to &s;uborn witne&s;&s;es to prove a charge of &s;odomy and perjury upon Oates; to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the earl of Shaft&s;bury; to accu&s;e the dukes of Monmouth and Buckingham, the earls of E&s;&s;ex, Hallifax, and others, of having been concerned in the con&s;pi|racy again&s;t the king and his brother. The earl of Ca&s;tlemain and the counte&s;s of Powis were &s;ent to the Tower; and the king him&s;elf was &s;u&s;pected of having encouraged this impo&s;ture. But people, who rea&s;oned without prejudice, be|lieved the confe&s;&s;ion and information were equally fal&s;e.</P>

<P>The earls of E&s;&s;ex and Hallifax pre&s;&s;ed the king to a&s;&s;emble the parliament: but, he was afraid of finding them irritated by this new di&s;|covery; and therefore with&s;tood all their importunities. Di&s;gu&s;ted at this refu&s;al, and dreading the popular re&s;entment, they withdrew them&s;elves from the king's confidence. E&s;&s;ex re&s;igned the trea&s;urer's &s;taff, which was be&s;towed upon Laurence Hyde, who, with Sunderland, and Godolphin, became his chief coun&s;ellors. Lord Ruffel, one of the mo&s;t popular and virtnous men in the
<PB N="489" REF="4910">
nation, $uitted the council-board: Sir William Temple retired to the country; and Shaft&s;bury being removed from the board, his place was f$lled by the earl of Radnor. The immediate cau&s;e of his removal was an in&s;ult he offered to the king in his ab&s;ence. Charles had met his brother at Newmark$$, from whence the duke of York &s;et out for Scotland: this interview was no &s;ooner known to Shaft&s;bury, than he called a council at Whitchall; and preffed them to pre&s;ent an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, repre&s;enting the danger to which his life was expo&s;ed from the duke's pre&s;ence.</P>

<P>This turbulent nobleman finding him&s;elf expelled from the coun|cil, and from all &s;hare in the admini&s;tration, advi&s;ed Monmouth to return to England, even without the king's leave. Charles refu&s;ed to &s;ee him when he arrived in London, but ordered him to leave the kingdom. In&s;tead of obey|ing this command, he accompanied Shaft&s;bury in a progre&s;s through many parts of the kingdom, among thou&s;ands of people who a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee this darling of the Engli&s;h nation. Such conduct &s;eemed to indicate a de&s;ign again&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. L'E&s;trange.

Shaft&s;bury, by means of his emiffaries, procured petitions to the king from different parts of the kingdom, demanding a parlia|ment; and excited &s;uch a &s;pirit of di&s;content again&s;t the government, as &s;eemed to progno&s;ticate a very dangerous rebellion. Charles was extremely incen&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1680.</NOTE> at the duke of Monmouth; and chagrined at &s;eeing him&s;elf de&s;erted by his coun&s;ellors. Lord Cavendi&s;h, Sir Henry Capel, and Mr. Powel, di&s;continued their attendance at council; and &s;ome places in the admiralty were relinqui&s;hed. All the antimini&s;terial members were re-elected in the new parliament$ and the whole nation was filled with murmurs, that foretold a &s;torm like that which had &s;wept his father from the throne.</P>

<P>The nearne&s;s and importance of the danger &s;eemed to in&s;pire him with more vigour than he was ever known to po&s;&s;e&s;s. The parliament meeting on the twenty-&s;ixth day of January, he told them, in a &s;hort &s;peech, that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the nation rendered an intermi&s;&s;ion ab&s;olutely nec&s;&s;ary; and therefore he prorogued them to the fifteenth day of April. Then he declared in council, that he had ordered the duke of York to return to court, judging his pre&s;ence nece&s;&s;ary at a time when que&s;tions were &s;tarted, in which his intere&s;t was &s;o nearly concerned. That prince returned in February, and was received by his brother with extraordinary marks of affection. In all probability, his advice and exhortations corroborated the king's re&s;olution: &s;o that he deter|mined to try his &s;trength with that re&s;tle&s;s faction which he could not appea&s;e. The parti&s;ans of the court retorted the practice of petitions upon their antagoni&s;ts. They took care to provide a great number of addre&s;&s;es to his maje&s;ty, expre&s;|&s;ing their abhorrence of the licentious freedom which had been taken in de|manding a parliament. One &s;ide was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Petitioners; the other acquired the appellation of Abhorrers. As their mutual animo&s;ity increa&s;ed, they reviled each other in the mo&s;t opporbrious terms. The party in the oppo&s;ition compared the courtiers to the Iri&s;h banditti, called Tories; and they, on the other hand, expre&s;&s;ed their contempt of the anticourtiers, by cla&s;|&s;ing them under the title of Whigs, a term of reproach formerly given to the rigid covenanters of Scotland, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to live upon a kind of
<PB N="490" REF="4920">
buttermilk called Whig in that country. From the&s;e beginnings were derived the famous names of Whig and Tory, which &s;till &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h the fac|tions of England, though they have &s;trangely varied from their original &s;ig|nification.</P>

<P>The whigs were headed by the earl of Shaft&s;bury, who was bent upon the ruin of the duke of York, in oppo&s;ition to whom he &s;et up the duke of Monmouth. He not only conducted him in the road to popularity, but circulated a report that the king had been actually married to Mrs. Walters the duke's mother; and that the contract of marriage was in a black box, in|tru&s;ted to the care of Mr. Gilbert Gerard. The king, in a council a&s;&s;embled for the purpo&s;e, declared this rumour was fal&s;e; and de&s;ired that a minute in|quiry might be &s;et on foot, to di&s;cover the author of &s;uch malicious &s;lander. Gerard being &s;ummoned to appear, declared upon oath, that he never had any &s;uch contract in his hands, and never heard that any &s;uch writing exi&s;ted. At la&s;t, the king publi&s;hed a declaration, that he never was married, nor conrracted to Mrs. Walters, or Barlow, mother to the duke of Monmouth, nor to any per&s;on what&s;oever, but queen Catherine. This declaration, atte&s;ted by all the privy-coun&s;ellors then pre&s;ent, was entered upon record in the court of chan|chery. In the &s;ummer, the earl of Ca&s;tlemain, and Cellier the midwife, were tried on account of the Meal-tub plot, and acquitted; and the grand-jury threw out the bill of indictment again&s;t the counte&s;s of Powis.</P>

<P>Bedloe died in Augu&s;t at Bri&s;tol, and not only in&s;i&s;ted upon the truth of his evidence again&s;t the je&s;uits, but al&s;o accu&s;ed the duke and the queen of having been concerned in the de&s;ign of introducing popery into Eng|land. He likewi&s;e declared he had many other circum&s;tances to di&s;cover, of importance to the king and nation; and be&s;ought the chief-ju&s;tice North, who vi&s;ited him in his illne&s;s, to intercede with his maje&s;ty for &s;ome allowance on which he could &s;ub&s;i&s;t. This &s;olicitation plainly proves he did not think him|&s;elf dying, and invalidates the credit which is &s;uppo&s;ed due to a death-bed con|fe&s;&s;ion. Be&s;ides, if he was really guilty of the blood of &s;o many innocent per&s;ons, he mu&s;t have been hardened in a long cour&s;e of villainy, beyond all &s;en&s;e of penitence and remor&s;e.</P>

<P>Though the court-party had of late gained ground, tho&s;e in the oppo&s;ition made &s;trong efforts to retain their influence in the nation. Clay|ton the mayor of London, having named a per&s;on for &s;heriff, who was di&s;a|greeable to the faction, the common-hall rejected him, and cho&s;e Bethel and Corni&s;h, two noted independents and republicans, who &s;acrificed their religion to their intere&s;t, &s;o far as to take the oaths and the &s;acrament, and renounce the convenant, to qualify them&s;elves for this employment. Then the common|council de&s;ired the mayor to petition the king to a&s;&s;emble the parliament: and a proclamation was in a few days publi&s;hed, to inform the public that the parlia|ment would a&s;&s;emble on the twenty-fir&s;t day of October. Shaftsbury, attended by the earl of Huntington, the lords Ru&s;&s;el, Cavendi&s;h, Grey, Brandon, Sir Henry Caverly, Sir Gilbert Gerard, and Sir William Cooper, appeared in We&s;t|man&s;ter-hall, and pre&s;ented to the grand jury of Middle&s;ex a bill of indictment again&s;t the duke of York, as a popi&s;h recu&s;ant. Before the jury fixed on any determination concerning this unexpected pre&s;entment, they were &s;uddenly di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed by the chief-ju&s;tice. This &s;tep in Shaftsbury was a declaration of eternal
<PB N="491" REF="4930">
war again&s;t the duke of York, by which he a&s;certained his inviolate attachment to his party. Charles, alarmed at their pre&s;umption, thought proper to do &s;omething to render the parliament le&s;s implacable. He in&s;i&s;ted upon his bro|ther's returning to Scotland, until the &s;torm &s;hould be overblown, a&s;&s;uring him he would never abandon his intere&s;t; and the duke, though not without reluc|tance, complied with his reque&s;t.</P>

<P>When the parliament a&s;&s;embled, the king in his &s;peech to both hou&s;es, informed them of his having concluded an alliance with Spain. He declared him&s;elf ready to concur with them in all rea&s;onable expedients for the &s;ecurity of the prote&s;tant religion, provided no prejudice &s;hould be offered to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. He exhorted them to pro&s;ecute the inquiry into the con&s;piracy; de|manded a &s;upply for the &s;upport of Tangier, which he could not maintain without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and above all things recommended a &s;trict union between them and him, as the chief article that would en&s;ure the &s;trength and pro&s;perity of the nation. The commons having cho&s;en their &s;peaker, began the &s;e&s;&s;ion by ex|pelling &s;ome of their own members, who had &s;ub&s;cribed the petitions of the abhorrers: for the &s;ame rea&s;on they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring he would remove from all public employment Sir George Jefferys recorder of London, and fir&s;t-judge of Che&s;ter. They inherited all the eagerne&s;s of the la&s;t parliament, with re&s;pect to the con&s;piracy. They received the informations of the new witne&s;&s;es, Dangerfield, Jenni&s;on, Dugdale, and one Turberville; and they recommended doctor Tongue to the king, for the fir&s;t good benefice in the gift of the crown that &s;hould become vacant. The lords Ru&s;&s;el and Capel expatiated upon all the &s;teps which the government had taken to the preju|dice of the nation. They imputed them wholly to the coun&s;els of papi&s;ts; and exaggerated the dangers to which the kingdom would be expo&s;ed from a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or. They were &s;econded by a great number of members, &s;ome of whom &s;poke of the duke in the mo&s;t virulent terms. At length, the hou&s;e renewed the votes which had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him in the former parliament, when lord Ru&s;&s;el moved, that a committee &s;hould be appointed to bring in a bill for ex|cluding the duke of York from the throne. This mea&s;ure, &s;o repugnant to the king's inclination, was e&s;pou&s;ed not only by the earl of Sunderland, but even by the dutche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, who, in all probability thought, that &s;hould the duke of York be &s;et a&s;ide, her &s;on might have &s;ome chance for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>There was now a very powerful party formed again&s;t the court, whether we re&s;pect the talents or the intere&s;t of tho&s;e that were in the oppo&s;ition; but, Charles was a&s;&s;ured of the church, which had ever adhered to lineal &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion; of all tho&s;e royali&s;ts who dete&s;ted fanatici&s;m and republican principles; and of a great number, who from a &s;incere regard to their country, dreaded the revival of that anarchy from which the nation had been &s;o lately delivered. The motion for the bill of exclu&s;ion produced violent debates in the lower hou&s;e, which were maintained with great eloquence and vivacity. It was &s;up|ported by lord Ru&s;&s;el, Sir William Jones, Sir Francis Winnington, Sir Henry Capel, Sir William Pulteney, colonel Titus, Treby, Hambden, and Montague. It was oppo&s;ed by Sir Leoline Jenkins &s;ecretrary of &s;tate, Sir John Erneley chan|cellor of the exchequer, Sir William Temple, Hyde, and Seymour. The ex|clu&s;ioni&s;ts a&s;&s;erted, That the king, lords, and commons of England, had a right to alter any part of the con&s;titution: That the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of
<PB N="492" REF="4940">
England had been often &s;et a&s;ide; and that &s;uch an expedient was never &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as at the pre&s;ent juncture, when the duke's bigotry to the church of Rome, his connexions with catholic princes, and his own arbitrary di&s;po&s;ition, threatened the nation with the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of popery, the per&s;ecution, and even the extirpation of the prote&s;tants, together with &s;uch acts of oppre&s;&s;ion as would in&s;tigate the people to take arms in their own defence, and intail an|other civil war upon the kingdom. Tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the bill, argued that the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was deemed a fundamental principle in all European monarchies; and had never been &s;et a&s;ide but by &s;ucce&s;sful u&s;urpation or ab|&s;olute tyranny: that it could never be altered, without expo&s;ing the kingdom to the mo&s;t violent convul&s;ions, unle&s;s the whole nation concurred in the change: that a legi&s;lature which deviates from a fundamental point of the con&s;titution, &s;ubverts that very principle of authority on which it&s;elf is founded: that although individuals acquie&s;ce in common laws enacted by a majority in parliament, the ca&s;e would be very different, were the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to be altered. A very powerful party would oppo&s;e this violation of the con&s;titution, and numberle&s;s mi&s;chiefs would en&s;ue: that the duke of York had &s;olemnly promi&s;ed his religion &s;hould never affect his public conduct: that the con&s;idera|tion of his own intere&s;t would prevent him from re-e&s;tabli&s;hing a religion &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to the genius of the people; or, if that &s;hould prove too weak, the limitations which the king had propo&s;ed would effectually re&s;train him from giving way to the dictates of his &s;uper&s;tition. La&s;tly, they ob&s;erved, that the king was determined to ri&s;que every thing rather than &s;acrifice the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and therefore it would be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider the con&s;equences of driving their &s;overeign to extremity.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e arguments, the bill was carried by a great majority: but it met with another fate in the upper hou&s;e, where the whole bench of bi&s;hops, except three, declared again&s;t it, as a dangerous innovation. It was defended by Shaft&s;bury, E&s;&s;ex, and Sunderland. They were an&s;wered by Hallifax, who di&s;played a &s;urpri&s;ing extent of capacity; and in eloquence far out&s;hone his uncle Shaft&s;bury, again&s;t whom he was animated by re&s;ent|ment and emulation. The king was pre&s;ent at the debate, which was pro|longed till eleven at night, when the bill was thrown out by a majority of thirty three. The commons were extremely mortified at this di&s;appointment; and &s;o incen&s;ed again&s;t Hallifax, that they addre&s;&s;ed the king to remove him from his councils and pre&s;ence for ever, on pretence of his having advi&s;ed the late prorogation of parliament. When the king, by a me&s;&s;age, exhorted them to di&s;patch the affair of the con&s;piracy, and proceed to the trial of the lords in the Tower; they an&s;wered, that the delay was occa&s;ioned by the pernicious coun&s;els of tho&s;e who had advi&s;ed him to di&s;&s;olve the la&s;t parliament, and prorogue the pre&s;ent. In&s;tead of complying with his demand for the relief of Tangier, which was be&s;ieged by the king of Morocco, they recapitulated all the in&s;tances of his mi&s;conduct, which his whole reign afforded: &s;ome of the members plainly &s;aid, that &s;hould they grant a &s;um of money for this &s;ervice, it would in all probability be converted to another u&s;e. They ob&s;erved, that although above a million had been rai&s;ed for a new navy, the king had not built one &s;ingle &s;hip; that two millions, granted for the &s;upport of the triple a$$iance, had been employed to de&s;troy that connexion; and that the king had
<PB N="493" REF="4950">
received a million to wage war with France, at a time when he was under a &s;ecret engagement with Lewis to effect a pacification. They drew up a re|mon&s;trance, in eighteen articles, repre&s;enting the danger to which the nation was expo&s;ed, from the favour &s;hewn to papi&s;ts, and in&s;inuating that the king was concerned in a con&s;piracy again&s;t the prote&s;tant religion, and the liberty of his people.</P>

<P>They re&s;olved to wreak their vengeance upon lord Stafford, one of the pri&s;oners in the Tower, uncle to the duke of Norfolk, a nobleman of narrow under&s;tanding, and already overwhelmed with old age and infirmities. On the thirtieth day of November, he was brought to trial by his peers, the chancellor, now created earl of Nottingham, being appointed lord high &s;tew|ard for the occa&s;ion. The evidences again&s;t him were Dugdale, Oates, and Turberville. The fir&s;t depo&s;ed that lord Stafford, at Tixhall, the hou&s;e of lord A&s;ton, had tempted him with the offer of five hundred pounds to murder the king. Oates &s;wore, that he &s;aw lord Stafford receive from Fenwick a com|mi&s;&s;ion for being payma&s;ter-general to the army. Turberville declared, that he had conver&s;ed with lord Stafford at Paris, where he promi&s;ed to make his fortune, if he would a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king, who was a heretic, and rebel again&s;t God Almighty. The pri&s;oner made &s;uch a defence as equally &s;urpri&s;ed his friends and enemies. He proved Dugdale to be a knave, who had cheated lord A&s;ton, defrauded his &s;ervants, and contracted debts, for which he had been committed to pri&s;on, from whence he had no other way of extricating him&s;elf but by turning informer. He likewi&s;e made it appear, that he was not at Tixhall on the day mentioned by the evidence. He invalidated the te&s;timony of Oates, by enumerating the omi&s;&s;ions, additions, and palpable contradictions in his former depo&s;itions; by reminding the court of his per$i|dious di&s;&s;imulation in point of religion; his &s;olemn abjurations and execrations to &s;upport that fal&s;hood by which he owned his credit was e&s;tabli&s;hed among the je&s;uits; and the improbability that a man concerned in a con&s;piracy of &s;uch importance, &s;hould have been abandoned to that mi&s;ery with which he was oppre&s;&s;ed when he fir&s;t turned informer. He proved that Turberville had eloped from a convent, and turned trooper in the French &s;ervice, from whence he had de&s;erted: that he lived in the utmo&s;t indigence in London, and had been heard to &s;ay, "By God! there is no better bu&s;ine&s;s than that of an informer:" and his &s;ervants &s;wore they had never &s;een Turberville with their lord, either in France or in England. The pri&s;oner ob&s;erved, that through a cour&s;e of forty years, he had pre&s;erved his loyalty, in the mid&s;t of danger, difficulty, and civil confu&s;ion; and that it was not credible he &s;hould now, in his old age, when broken with infirmities, renounce the ea&s;e and affluence he enjoyed, to belye his former conduct, and engage in &s;uch a villainous con&s;piracy again&s;t his &s;overeign, who had been always to him remarkably generous and in|dulgent.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;trength of his defence, the &s;implicity of his deportment, and his pathetic prote&s;tations of innocence, he was con|victed of high trea&s;on, by a majority of four and twenty voices. Hearing the verdict, he exclaimed, "God's holy name be prai&s;ed!" When the high &s;teward gave him to under&s;tand that the peers would intercede with his ma|je&s;ty, that his &s;entence might be mitigated into decapitation, he &s;hed a flood

of tears, telling them he was not moved to this weakne&s;s by the fear of death, but by a deep &s;en&s;e of their goodne&s;s. Though he was not afraid to die, he di&s;covered a de&s;ire of life; and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the lords, intimating that he would di&s;cover all he knew of any de&s;igns again&s;t the government. Being brought to the hou&s;e, he di&s;clo&s;ed &s;ome &s;chemes in which he had been con|cerned, for obtaining a toleration in favour of the catholics; and mentioned the earl of Shaft&s;bury as one who had undertaken to procure this indulgence. The lords would not &s;uffer him to proceed; but remanded him to the Tower, where he began to prepare for death with equal courage and re&s;ignation. On the twenty-ninth day of December, he was brought to the &s;caffold, where, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, he declared him&s;elf innocent of the crimes laid to his charge. He &s;poke of the witne&s;&s;es with charity and compa&s;&s;ion; di&s;|a$owed all the murdering and immoral principles imputed to the Roman ca|tholics; and expre&s;&s;ed his hope that the public would &s;oon be undeceived, and do ju&s;tice to his injured reputation. The populace were melted at the meek|ne&s;s, piety, and re&s;ignation of this antient nobleman, who&s;e character had been always untainted, till the date of this accu&s;ation. When he repeated his prote&s;tations with regard to his innocence, they cried aloud, <Q>&startq;We believe you, my lord&mdash;God ble&s;s you, my lord.&endq;</Q> Even the executioner was &s;oft|ened: he could not perform his office without he&s;itation and marks of &s;ym|pathy; and, when he held up the head, according to cu&s;tom, exclaiming, "This is the head of a traitor," no expre&s;&s;ion of a&s;&s;ent was heard: all was &s;till, &s;ilent, and &s;orrowful.</P>

<P>This was the la&s;t blood &s;hed on account of that pretended con|&s;piracy, which was invented by a few needy mi&s;creants, for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing them&s;elves from indigence and contempt; and afterwards fo&s;tered by a dangerous faction, to blow up the flames of di&s;cord through the kingdom. To an&s;wer this perfidious aim, they &s;crupled not to abu&s;e a whole people; to exa&s;perate them into a &s;avage di&s;regard of truth and common ju&s;tice; and to exerci&s;e &s;uch acts of barbarity as will remain upon record, an indelible &s;tain upon the character of the nation. The commons demanded other victims than lord Stafford, who had di&s;appointed them greatly, in the hope they had con|ceived that he would make &s;ome di&s;covery that would &s;erve to keep up the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. North $emple. $word$ $word$.</NOTE> general ferment, which now began to &s;ub&s;ide. They voted, that a bill &s;hould be brought in for bani&s;hing the mo&s;t con&s;iderable papi&s;ts from the king|dom: that while the catholics retained any hope of &s;eeing the duke of York a&s;cend the throne, the per&s;on of the king, the prote&s;tant religion, and the lives and liberties of the people, would be in imminent danger. Then they re&s;olved to prepare a bill for an a&s;&s;ociation to defend the king's per&s;on, the prote&s;tant religion, and all per&s;ons of that per&s;ua&s;ion, again&s;t inva&s;ion and op|po&s;ition; as well as to prevent the duke of York, or any other popi&s;h prince, from &s;ucceeding to the throne of England. They propo&s;ed &s;everal other bills, as re&s;trictions on the prerogative; and, in an addre&s;s, be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to grant his a&s;&s;ent to an act of parliament for excluding his brother from the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

of the &s;tate of the nation, and the &s;ituation of Chri&s;tendom, in &s;uch a manner as would enable him to &s;uccour Tangier, &s;upport his alliances, and &s;ecure the peace of the kingdom. Before they received this an&s;wer, they had brought in a bill for exempting prote&s;tant nonconformi&s;ts from the penal|ties impo&s;ed by an act in the reign of queen Elizabeth; and it pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es: but the clerk of the crown concealed it, by the king's order; &s;o that when he came to the hou&s;e it was not to be found. He had always declared for a general indulgence, the benefit of which would have ex|tended to his catholic &s;ubjects: but he thought the pre&s;byterians, who&s;e inte|re&s;t predominated in this parliament, had little rea&s;on to expect he would in|dulge them with an exclu&s;ive toleration. The commons drew up articles of im|peachment again&s;t lord chief-ju&s;tice Scroggs, for having endeavoured to &s;tifle the con&s;piracy; and for having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the grand jury of Middle&s;ex in an irregular manner, when the duke of York was pre&s;ented as a popi&s;h recu&s;ant. They concurred with the lords, in voting that there actually was, and had been for &s;everal years, a horrible con&s;piracy in Ireland, hatched by the papi&s;ts, to ma&s;&s;acre the prote&s;tants, and overturn the e&s;tabli&s;hed government of that king|dom; and that the hope of &s;eeing the duke of York upon the throne of England, had encouraged the &s;aid con&s;piracy. The lower hou&s;e, after violent debates upon the king's la&s;t an&s;wer, re&s;olved, that the act of exclu&s;ion was the only &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for the king's life, the prote&s;tant religion, and the e&s;tabli&s;hed government: that, until &s;uch an act &s;hould pa&s;s, the commons could not grant any &s;upplies, without endangering the king's per&s;on and the prote&s;tant religion, and betraying the people they repre&s;ented: that all tho&s;e who had advi&s;ed his maje&s;ty to per&s;i&s;t in oppo&s;ing the bill of exclu&s;ion, had given pernicious coun&s;el, were favourers of popery, and enemies to the king and kingdom. They re&s;olved that an addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to the king, de&s;iring he would remove from his pre&s;ence and councils, the earls of Hallifax, Worce&s;ter, Clarendon, Fever&s;ham, and Laurence Hyde. They voted, that whoever &s;hould lend money, or promote loans to the king, upon the cu&s;toms, exci&s;e, or other taxes, or accept or purcha&s;e tallies, or anticipa|tions, upon the king's revenues, &s;hould be deemed an enemy to parliaments, and pro&s;ecuted as &s;uch by the two hou&s;es.</P>

<P>The&s;e violent proceedings plainly demon&s;trated that they either in|tended to involve the kingdom in a civil war, or hoped the king's ea&s;y tem|per would be intimidated or influenced into a de&s;ertion of his brother's intere&s;t. Their in&s;olence, however, &s;erved only to excite his re&s;entment, without im|pairing his re&s;olution. The dutche&s;s of Port&s;mouth fell upon her knees, and begged he would not ruin him&s;elf for the &s;ake of his brother. Mr. Sidney, his amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, tran&s;mitted to him a memorial written by Fagel, pen&s;ionary of Holland, to prove that the king could not &s;upport the duke of York, without abandoning the intere&s;ts of Europe. He re&s;i&s;ted all importu|nities and remon&s;trances with &s;urpri&s;ing fortitude; and, rather than injure his brother, re&s;olved to prorogue the parliament. This was a power which he had not, like his father, re&s;igned. The commons receiving intimation of his de|&s;ign, before he went to the hou&s;e of lords, voted, in a tumultuous manner, that whoever advi&s;ed his maje&s;ty to prorogue the parliament, was a traitor to the king, the kingdom, and the prote&s;tant religion, a pen&s;ioner of France,

and one who favoured the inte$e&s;ts of that crown$ that, in the opinion of the hou&s;e, the acts made in the reign of queen Elizabeth, again&s;t popi&s;h recu|&s;an$s, ought not to extend to proce&s;tant di&s;&s;$$ters; and that the pro&s;ecution of prote&s;tant nonconformi&s;ts is an oppre&s;&s;ion upon the &s;ubject: that it weake$s the prote&s;tant intere&s;t$ encourages popery, and is productive of dangerous con&s;equences to the kingdom: that thanks be given to the city of London for their loyalty, care, and vigilance, in the pre&s;ervation of the king and the prote&s;tant religion: that, in the opinion of the hou&s;e, the great fire of Lon|don was kindled by the papi&s;ts, in order to introduce popery and arbitrary power: that an addre&s;s be pre&s;ented to his maje&s;ty, de&s;iring him to re&s;tore the duke of Monmouth to all his offices, of which he had been dive&s;ted by the influence of the duke of York. The&s;e votes had &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed when the u&s;her of the black rod came and &s;ummoned them to the upper hou&s;e, where the king pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome bills; and then the chancellor prorogued them till the twentieth day of January. In three days after this prorogation, the mayor and common-council of London pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to his maje&s;ty, be&s;eech|ing him to re-a&s;&s;emble the parliament at the appointed time, that they might regulate the important affairs of the kingdom. This remon&s;trance &s;erved only to irritate the king, who i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, di&s;&s;olving the parliament. At the &s;ame time he convoked another to meet on the twenty-fir&s;t day of March, at Oxford.</P>

<P>Though he knew the intere&s;t of the pre&s;byterians &s;till prevailed in all the corporations, he re&s;olved to try every expedient for obtaining a parlia|ment that &s;hould be le&s;s implacable; and he was de&s;irous of meeting them at a di&s;tance from London, which had been always unpropitious to him and his family. It was not without rea&s;on that he dreaded the inhabitants of this opu|lent city. They re-elected the four members who had repre&s;ented them in the two la&s;t parliaments. They pre&s;ented them with an addre&s;s of thanks for their endeavours to obtain an act of exclu&s;ion again&s;t the duke of York. They expre&s;&s;ed their hope that the members would never agree to any &s;upplied, un|til the kingdom &s;hould be &s;ecured again&s;t popery and arbitrary power; and de|clared they would &s;upport them with their lives and fortunes. The example of London was followed by almo&s;t all the corporations in the kingdom; &s;o that the king fore&s;aw he &s;hould be at the head of the &s;ame parliament he had di&s;&s;olved. The duke of Monmouth, with fifteen peers, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, petitioning that his maje&s;ty would not a&s;&s;emble the parliament at Oxford, where the two hou&s;es could not meet with &s;afety, or debate with freedom, while expo&s;ed to the attempts of the papi&s;ts, a great number of which had in&s;inuated them&s;elves into his maje&s;ty's guards. This was a mortifying remon&s;trance to Charles, who would not favour the petitioners with any an&s;wer, but eyed them with looks of indignation.</P>

<P>Each party had for &s;ome time reviled and ridiculed the other, in pamphlets and libels$ and this practice was attended with a remarkable inci|dent. One Fitzharris, an Iri&s;h papi&s;t, dependent on the dutche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, for who&s;e peru&s;al he u&s;ed to purcha&s;e tho&s;e occa&s;ional &s;atires, propo&s;ed, to a Scotchman of the name of Everhard, to write a libel again&s;t the king and the duke of York. The Scot was actually a &s;py for the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts. He be|lieved this was a &s;cheme to entrap him, and re&s;olved to retort the intended
<PB N="497" REF="4990">
mi&s;chief on the head of Fitzharris. He a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al, and they agreed to meet in a hou&s;e where Everhard had previou&s;ly po&s;ted Sir William Waller, an eminent ju&s;tice of the peace, and two other per&s;ons, within hearing. There Fitzharris and Everhard compo&s;ed a virulent libel again&s;t the king and his brother, replete with trea&s;on and &s;currility. Waller immediately informed the king of this tran&s;action, and obtained a warrant for apprehending Fitz|harris, in who&s;e pocket the libel was found. Seeing him&s;elf in the hands of ju&s;tice, and knowing the management of all the former trials had been left to the country-party, he re&s;olved to de&s;erve their favour, and declared he had been employed by the court to write the libel, that the odium of it might be thrown upon the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts. He &s;aid the intention of the mini&s;try was to &s;end copies of it to all the leaders of the oppo&s;ition, and to arre&s;t them im|mediately, as per&s;ons engaged in a con&s;piracy, the belief of which this paper would &s;erve to confirm. He likewi&s;e pretended to make new di&s;coveries about the popi&s;h plot, and told a great many improbable circum&s;tances, which he had invented for the purpo&s;e. He was at fir&s;t committed to New|gate; but the king, either believing that the oppo&s;ite party would tamper with him, or hoping that he might be rendered u&s;eful to the de&s;igns of the court, granted an order for removing him to the Tower, where he is &s;aid to have been practi&s;ed upon by Hawkins the chaplain, to own he was &s;uborned by the country-party.</P>

<P>When the parliament a&s;&s;embled at Oxford, the members on both &s;ides were armed and attended by their friends and adherents, as if they had expected an immediate rupture. The repre&s;entatives of London, in particular, were &s;urrounded by a numerous band of hor&s;emen, di&s;tingui&s;hed by knots of ribbons in&s;cribed "No popery; no &s;lavery." The king's &s;peech to this par|liament was couched in a very unu&s;ual &s;tile. He complained of the in&s;up|portable proceedings of the la&s;t hou&s;e of commons; and plainly told them, that as he never intended to exerci&s;e arbitrary power over others, &s;o he would not allow it to be exerci&s;ed over him&s;elf. He &s;aid, if they would con&s;ider the pro|vocations he had undergone, they would find more cau&s;e to wonder at his long patience, than at the re&s;entment which he had lately expre&s;&s;ed. He ob&s;erved, that his a&s;&s;embling them upon this occa&s;ion plainly proved that no irregularities on their part &s;hould ever in&s;pire him with a di&s;gu&s;t for parliaments. He hoped the bad &s;ucce&s;s of former animo&s;ities would di&s;po&s;e them to more mo|deration, and induce them to con&s;ider what &s;teps it would be nece&s;&s;ary to take in the pre&s;ent conjuncture. He expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t de&s;ire of removing all rea&s;onable fears ari&s;ing from the po&s;&s;ibility of a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and added, that he would willingly li&s;ten to any practicable &s;cheme for putting the govern|ment intirely into prote&s;tant hands, during the life of any prince who &s;hould profe&s;s the catholic religion. Some expedients had been &s;ugge&s;ted for this purpo&s;e; but they were even more di&s;agreeable to the duke than was the bill of execution.</P>

They re&s;olved to try him by impeach|ment; and, to manife&s;t their contempt for the court, ordered &s;ecretary Jen|kins to carry up the articles to the hou&s;e of lords. He was &s;o incen&s;ed at being cho&s;en for this employment, that he at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to comply with the order of the hou&s;e; but he thought proper to &s;ubmit, when they threatened to com|mit him for his di&s;obedience.

<P>Their next &s;tep was to examine the expedients propo&s;ed in lieu of the bill of exclu&s;ion. It was propo&s;ed, That the duke &s;hould be bani&s;hed, during life, to the di&s;tance of five hundred miles from any part of the Briti&s;h dominions: That the government &s;hould be wholly ve&s;ted in a regent: That this office &s;hould be conferred upon the prince&s;s of Orange; and, in ca&s;e of her death, devolve to her &s;i&s;ter Anne: That &s;hould the duke of York have a &s;on educated in the prote&s;tant religion, the &s;aid regent &s;hould act during his minority: That, though the kingdom &s;hould be governed in the name of James II. yet no man &s;hould take arms for him, or by virtue of his commi&s;&s;ion, on pain of being capitally puni&s;hed: and, That the &s;ame penalty &s;hould be decreed again&s;t any per&s;on who &s;hould affirm that the &s;imple title of King takes away all defects men|tioned in this act, or in any &s;hape eludes the obligation of it: That all officers, civil and military, &s;hould take an oath to ob&s;erve this &s;tatute: That acts of the &s;ame nature &s;hould pa&s;s in the parliaments of Scotland and Ireland: That, in ca&s;e the duke of York &s;hould enter either of the three kingdoms, he &s;hould be excluded "ip&s;o facto," and the &s;overeignty devolve to the regent: That all papi&s;ts of any con&s;ideration &s;hould be bani&s;hed by name, and their children educated in the prote&s;tant religion. Rigorous as the&s;e expedients were, the commons rejected them, and re&s;umed the bill of exclu&s;ion. In a word, the leaders of the oppo&s;ition were re&s;olved to be di&s;&s;atisfied with every thing the king could propo&s;e, in hope of humbling him into the mo&s;t abject &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>The lords having rejected the impeachment again&s;t Fitzharris, and remitted his trial to the ordinary courts of judicature; the commons ex|claimed again&s;t this refu&s;al, which indeed was unprecedented. They voted, that the commons a&s;&s;embled in parliament had an undoubted right to im|peach any per&s;on, whether peer or commoner, before the lords, for high trea&s;on, or any other crime what&s;oever; and that the refu&s;al of &s;uch an impeachment was a real denial of ju&s;tice: that Edward Fitzharris having been impeached by the commons, the lords had denied ju&s;tice, and violated the con&s;titution of parliaments, in ordering him to be pro&s;ecuted at common law; and that no inferior court of judicature could proceed again&s;t Fitzharris, without violating the privileges of parliament. The&s;e violent re&s;olutions being taken, they con|verted their attention to the bill of exclu&s;ion, again&s;t which no member pre|&s;umed to &s;peak, except &s;ecretary Jenkins, who underwent the mo&s;t acrimonious raillery and deri&s;ion.

from whence he next day repaired to London, where he publi&s;hed a de|claration, containing his rea&s;ons for di&s;&s;olving the two la&s;t parliaments.

<P>Their in&s;olence and pre&s;umption were in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;ucceeded by fear and dejection; and they retired quietly to their own homes, without having concerted any mea&s;ures for their future conduct.

<P>Charles did not enjoy his triumph with moderation. His tem|per, which had been always ea&s;y and merciful, became arbitrary, and even cruel. He entertained all the fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es and informers who had been &s;o infamou&s;ly in&s;trumental in &s;hedding innocent blood. They had formerly &s;erved the pur|po&s;es of the oppo&s;ite faction. They now offered their &s;ervices to the court, and met with a very favourable reception. The mini&s;try &s;eemed determined to re|taliate and retort upon the Whigs, all the forgery and inhumanity which they had &s;o long countenanced and &s;upported. Fitzharris &s;uffered in company with Oliver Plunket the titular archbi&s;hop of Armagh, a man of very moderate prin|ciples, who had always maintained a fair character, until he was accu&s;ed by &s;ome profligate Iri&s;h prie&s;ts, who came over to drive the trade of evidence. They were encouraged by the earl of Shaft&s;bury, though their information was ab&s;urd and contradictory, and their characters were in all re&s;pects vile and infamous. They &s;wore Plunket had collected a va&s;t &s;um of money, enli&s;ted an army, and expected a de&s;cent from France, to favour a ma&s;&s;acre of the prote&s;tants. His defence con&s;i&s;ted in an ab&s;olute denial of all that was laid to his charge; not|with&s;tanding which he was convicted and condemned, and &s;uffered death with great compo&s;ure, prote&s;ting his innocence to the la&s;t moment of his life.</P>

<P>The king, in order to convince the world of the &s;uperiority he had acquired, committed Shaft&s;bury to the Tower, and at the &s;ame time impri&s;oned &s;everal other per&s;ons of inferior rank, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves as partizans of that party. Among the&s;e was one College, known by the name of the "Prote&s;tant joyner," a factious zealot, who had been u&s;ed as a tool by the leaders of the party, and often &s;poken of the king and royal family with the mo&s;t provoking in&s;olence. He had accompanied the city|members to Oxford, armed with &s;word and pi&s;tol, and was now pre&s;ented by the grand jury of London, as guilty of &s;edition. Though the bill was returned "ignoramus," the court would not de&s;i&s;t from pro&s;ecuting this unhappy man, who was the fir&s;t victim devoted to their vengeance. After having been expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t inhuman acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, he was conveyed to Oxford, on pretence of his having uttered trea&s;onable expre&s;&s;ions in that city. He was indicted for trea&s;on, and tried at the a&s;&s;ize before a partial judge and packed jury. He was accu&s;ed by Dugdale, Turberville, and others, who had pro&s;ti|tuted their con&s;ciences again&s;t the catholics; and, when objections were made to their characters, the mini&s;try ob&s;erved that they were the &s;ame people whom the whigs had cheri&s;hed and &s;upported as evidences in the popi&s;h con&s;piracy. Nothing could be more &s;avage and wicked than this kind of retaliation. Col|lege made a vigorous defence, and proved him&s;elf innocent, to the &s;atisfaction of every unprejudiced &s;pectator; neverthele&s;s he was found guilty, amid&s;t the acclamations of the populace. He bore his fate with un&s;haken fortitude, and at his execution denied the crime for which he had been condemned.</P>

<P>Titus Oates, the original informer, was the only per&s;on of that &s;tamp who&s;e &s;ervices were now rejected; he was, by an order of council, ignominiou&s;ly expelled from Whitehall, and even forbid to come within a certain di&s;tance of that palace. But the king's re&s;entment was chiefly directed again&s;t the earl of S$aft&s;bury, who had certainly harra&s;&s;ed him with the mo&s;t implacable and indefatigable malic. No &s;ums were &s;pared to &s;eek for evidence, and even to &s;uborn witne&s;&s;es, again&s;t this nobleman. A bill of indictment being pre&s;ented to the grand jury, the witne&s;&s;es were examined in open court, and &s;wore to &s;uch incredible circum&s;tances as mu&s;t have invalidated their te&s;timony, even though they had not been already branded as perjured villains. Among his papers indeed there was a draught of an a&s;&s;ociation, which might have been con&s;trued into trea&s;on; but it was not in the hand-writing of Shaftsbury, nor could his adver&s;aries prove that he had ever communicated this &s;cheme to any per&s;on, or &s;ignified his approbation of any &s;uch project. Bethel and Corni&s;h had been &s;ucceeded in the office of &s;heriffs by Shute and Pilkington, men of the &s;ame principles; and they took care to &s;ummon a jury that rejected the bill of ind$ctment again&s;t the earl; a circum&s;tance &s;o agreeable to the populace, that the whole city rung with acclamations.</P>

<P>In Scotland the court met with no oppo&s;ition, even in the mo&s;t arbi|trary mea&s;ures. The duke of York, as king's commi&s;&s;ioner, had a&s;&s;embled the parliament of that kingdom in July. They pa&s;&s;ed an act, acknowledging that the crown of Scotland had, by an inherent right, by the nature of the monarchy, and the fundamental laws of the kingdom, always de&s;cended to the heir of blood; and that no law or con&s;ideration could alter the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: they enacted another &s;tatute for impo&s;ing upon per&s;ons in office a te&s;t oath,
<PB N="501" REF="5030">
acknowledging the king's &s;upremacy, renouncing the covenant, and e&s;pou&s;ing the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience: a clau&s;e, however, was admitted in favour of the prote&s;tant religion, ratifying an old confe&s;&s;ion of faith, in which the maxim of re&s;i&s;tance was inculcated; &s;o that the act was a collection of ab&s;urd contradictions, patched up in a hurry by people of different parties. A great number of eccle&s;ia&s;tics re&s;igned their livings, rather than a&s;&s;ent upon oath to &s;uch incon&s;i&s;tencies: the earl of Argyle refu&s;ed to take it, without an explana|tion. He was a con&s;cientious nobleman, of the presbyterian per&s;ua&s;ion; he had adhered to the king in all his adver&s;ity, and been re&s;tored to his paternal honours and e&s;tate. He was afterwards unju&s;tly convicted and condemned for "lea&s;ing-making," upon an old ab&s;urd &s;tatute; and obtained his pardon. When the courtiers in Scotland propo&s;ed that the princes of the blood &s;hould be exempted from the te&s;t oath, he argued &s;trenuou&s;ly again&s;t this exception, ob&s;erving that the danger to which the prote&s;tant religion was chiefly expo&s;ed, aro&s;e from the po&s;&s;ible perver&s;ion of the royal family. By this oppo&s;ition he incurred the duke's di&s;plea&s;ure; which, however, that prince carefully di&s;|&s;embled. When the oath was tendered to Argyle, he &s;aid he took it as far as it was con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf and the prote&s;tant religion; he declared he did not mean to bind him&s;elf up from endeavouring, con&s;i&s;tently with his loyalty and con&s;cience, to effect any alteration that might prove advantageous to church or &s;tate. For this expre&s;&s;ion he was committed pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle, tried for lea&s;ing-making and perjury, convicted, and condemned to death. The king, however, ordered the execution of the &s;entence to be &s;u&s;pended until his plea|&s;ure &s;hould be farther known; in the mean time the earl e&s;caped from his confinement, and took refuge in Holland. The parti&s;ans of the duke pre|tended that he had no de&s;ign again&s;t the life of Argyle, but only again&s;t the hereditary juri&s;dictions, by which he maintained a very dangerous authority in the Highlands.</P>

<P>The fanatics in Scotland continued to in&s;ult the law, through a mi&s;|guided zeal for religion. They were actuated by two furious preachers, called Cameron and Cargill; the fir&s;t was &s;lain in a &s;kirmi&s;h, after he had publi&s;hed a declaration at Dumfries, renouncing his allegiance to the king, becau&s;e he had broke the covenant. Cargill was taken and executed, together with one Hack&s;ton, who had been concerned in the murder of archbi&s;hop Sharpe. This man was de&s;perately wounded when taken. He was tried in a &s;ummary way, le&s;t his death &s;hould anticipate the &s;troke of ju&s;tice. He endured the amputa|tion of his hands without &s;hrinking; and then a&s;ked, with great compo&s;ure, if they cho&s;e to cut off his feet. He was afterwards hanged, and his heart, being cut out, was &s;een to palpitate on the executioner's knife. About fifteen per|&s;ons, male and female, &s;uffered death rather than &s;ay, "God ble&s;s the king;"<NOTE PLACE="marg">L'E&s;trange. Burnet. Rapin. Ralph. Hume.</NOTE> for, upon this condition, the duke offered to &s;pare their lives. They gloried in their &s;ufferings, and died in tran&s;ports of joy. At length the duke, pitying their infatuation, put a &s;top to the executions, and ordered tho&s;e poor deluded wretches to be kept to hard labour in a hou&s;e of correction. In other re&s;pects he per&s;ecuted the presbyterians with great &s;everity, and even incurred the impu|ration of barbarity, by &s;eeming curious to ob&s;erve the agonies of &s;ome wretches who were put to the torture by the de&s;poti&s;m of the government. The king having now obtained a complete victory over all oppo&s;ition, the duke repaired to
<PB N="502" REF="5040">
London, that he might &s;hare the fruits of his brother's good fortune; and acquired &s;uch an influence over Charles, that he in effect governed the three<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1$82.</NOTE> kingdoms. He made another voyage to Scotland by &s;ea, in the Dolphin frigate, which, chancing to &s;trike upon a &s;and-bank in the pa&s;&s;age, was lo&s;t. The duke &s;aved him&s;elf in the long-boat, with a few per&s;ons whom he named for admittance. On this occa&s;ion he is &s;aid to have &s;aved &s;ome ob&s;cure prie&s;ts, and a number of favourite dogs, while many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction were left to peri&s;h. Such was the loyalty of the &s;hip's crew, that, when they &s;aw him safe in the boat, they expre&s;&s;ed their joy in loud acclamations, though they knew that they them&s;elves would be drowned in a few moments. The govern|ment of Scotland he left in the hands of the earls of Aberdeen and Queen&s;|berry: the fir&s;t was chancellor and the other trea&s;urer of that kingdom, which they ruled with rods of iron. The Scots, &s;ince the re&s;toration, had been &s;ub|jected to &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tyrants, that the &s;pirit of liberty was almo&s;t extingui&s;hed in the nation. The impo&s;ition of the te&s;t oath was attended with &s;uch acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, that many thou&s;ands re&s;olved to withdraw them&s;elves into another country, where they might enjoy that liberty of con&s;cience which was denied them at home; and they &s;ent up agents to London to treat with the proprietors of Carolina about their &s;ettling in that colony. Yet, in the mid&s;t of all this de&s;poti&s;m and national calamity, the duke had found means to con|ciliate the affections of the nobility and clergy, in&s;omuch that the prelates of the kingdom wrote a letter to Sancroft, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, extolling in the mo&s;t hyperbolical terms the duke's mild and upright admini&s;tration, and in particular his affection to the church.</P>

<P>The king, finding his authority ab&s;olute, re&s;olved to humble the presbyterians, and even practi&s;ed the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable methods for the grati|fication of his revenge; in which he was in&s;tigated by the violent coun&s;els of his brother. The nonconformi&s;ts were rigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted, on the &s;tatute enacted in the reign of queen Elizabeth; all magi&s;trates, judges, ju&s;tices of the peace, and lieutenants of counties, &s;u&s;pected of leaning towards republican principles, were dive&s;ted of their employments, and their places filled with approved tories. The clergy te&s;tified their devotion to the court, in their writings and &s;ermons: the pulpits re&s;ounded with the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and nonre&s;i&s;tance; and the king received an infinite number of addre&s;&s;es, profe&s;&s;ing the utmo&s;t abhorrence of the principles avowed in the a&s;&s;ociation which had been found among Shaftsbury's papers. The mutual animo&s;ity between the two parties was now inflamed into rage and rancour; and Charles declared him&s;elf the head of a faction. The city of London &s;till maintained its independence, and the &s;heriffs influenced the grand-jury in &s;uch a manner, as &s;kreened the presbyterians of that capital from oppre&s;&s;ion. Sir John Moor, the mayor, had been gained over to the court-intere&s;t; and he named two per&s;ons for &s;heriffs who he knew would be agreeable to the mini&s;try. The common-hall and the citizens taking the alarm, in&s;i&s;ted upon an election by liveries, and Papillon and Dubois were elected by a great majority: never|thele&s;s the mayor carried on a &s;eparate poll in favour of North and Rich; and, being &s;upported by the mini&s;try, forced them upon the public. In the &s;ame irregular manner he &s;ecured a &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the mayoralty, whom he knew devoted to the king's commands. This was a point of great importance to

Charles, and &s;o well under&s;tood by the earl of Sha$tsbury, that he thought proper to quit the kingdom, and fix his re&s;idence in Holland; that very country, the ruin of which he had planned in the cabinet, and urged in parlia|ment in the remarkable words, "Delenda e&s;t Carthago." The duke of York, now that the magi&s;tracy of London was at his devotion, &s;ued alderman Pil|kington on a writ of Scandalum magnatum, for having &s;aid of him, when he heard of his return from Scotland, <Q>&startq;He has already burned the city, and now he is coming to cut all our throats.&endq;</Q> For this indi&s;creet expre&s;&s;ion he was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rapin.

Sir Patience Ward, who gave evidence in his behalf, being &s;ued for perjury, was convicted and condemned to the pillory. The earl of Sunderland had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate when he voted for the bill of exclu&s;ion, and his place had been filled with lord Conway; but, upon this nobleman's re&s;ignation, Sunderland was taken again into favour, and by &s;ome people &s;u&s;|pected of having joined the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts, on purpo&s;e to learn and betray their &s;ecrets to the mini&s;try <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prince Rupert, the duke of Lauderdale, the earls of Nottingham and Sha$t&s;bury, died in the cour&s;e of this year; and Mr. Thyn was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|ted in the &s;treets of London by count Coning&s;|mark, two of who&s;e accomplices were exe|cuted at Tyburn.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Charles was at this time &s;ecure of the magi&s;try in London, but he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1683.</NOTE> fore&s;aw a &s;trong oppo&s;ition at the next election, and that he would be every year expo&s;ed to the &s;ame &s;truggles, and oppo&s;ed, not only in London, but likewi&s;e in all the corporations which were under presbyterian management. While that intere&s;t prevailed he could never expect to &s;ee a parliament propitious to his de&s;ires; and he was &s;o much involved in debts and difficulties, that he could hardly &s;ub&s;i&s;t without a parliamentary &s;upply: he therefore formed a project for rai&s;ing a de&s;potic authority over all the corporations of England. He began with London, again&s;t which he i&s;&s;ued a writ of "Quo warranto," to enquire into the validity of its charter, which he pretended the corporation had forfeited in two in&s;tances. They were charged with having impo&s;ed a toll, in order to defray the expence of rebuilding their markets after the fire of Lon|don, and of having pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, containing a &s;candalous reflection upon his maje&s;ty and his admini&s;tration. The cau&s;e was tried in the court of King's-Bench, and Treby and Pollexfen pleaded as coun&s;ellors for the city: they proved, that all corporations had a power to make bye-laws; that &s;ubjects were inve&s;ted with an inherent right to petition the king; that the reflection in the addre&s;s charged upon them as &s;candalous, was not levelled at the king, but his evil coun&s;ellors, who had advi&s;ed him to prorogue the par|liament; and they expatiated upon the inju&s;tice of annihilating a whole corpo|ration for the faults of their magi&s;trates, who were liable to pro&s;ecution as individuals. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e arguments, the judges, who were wholly influenced by the mini&s;try, declared that the city of London had forfeited its privileges, and that its charter was at the king's di&s;po&s;al. The judgment, however, was not recorded until his maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure &s;hould be known. The citizens of London were confounded and di&s;mayed at this tran&s;action. A common-council being a&s;&s;embled, the majority agreed to &s;ubmit to the king's plea&s;ure, before the &s;entence &s;hould be recorded. They accordingly pre&s;ented a petition to that effect; and the king offered to re&s;tore their charter, on the follow|ing
<PB N="504" REF="5060">
conditions: That no mayor or other officer of the commonalty &s;hould exer|ci&s;e his office until his election &s;hould be confirmed under the king's &s;ign manual: That, in ca&s;e his maje&s;ty &s;hould di&s;approve of their choice of a mayor and &s;heriffs, they &s;hould proceed to a new election; and, provided the &s;econd &s;hould be di&s;agreeable to the king, he &s;hould appoint per&s;ons of his own nomi|nation: That the mayor and court of aldermen &s;hould be empowered to dive&s;t any alderman of his office, by the king's permi&s;&s;ion: That, &s;hould an alderman after his election be deemed incapable by the court of aldermen, the quarter &s;hould be obliged to chu&s;e another; and, &s;hould he prove unacceptable to the court, a third &s;hould be elected by the court it&s;elf; and that the ju&s;tices of the peace in London &s;hould act only by virtue of the king's commi&s;&s;ion. The&s;e were &s;evere terms, to which, however, the common-council &s;ubmitted, by a majority of eighteen voices. Other corporations, &s;eeing the fate of London, were ea&s;ily induced to &s;urrender their charters into the hands of the king, from whence they were not retrieved but by the payment of con&s;iderable &s;ums of money.</P>

<P>Such an arbitrary and cruel admini&s;tration could hardly fail to pro|duce de&s;igns again&s;t the government, in a nation abounding with people who entertained even the mo&s;t extravagant notions of liberty. The earl of Sha$t&s;|bury, even before the la&s;t parliament, had engaged the duke of Monmouth, the lords Ru&s;&s;el and Grey, to ri&s;e in arms and oppo&s;e the duke's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion at the death of Charles: they afterwards a&s;&s;ociated the earls of E&s;&s;ex and Sali&s;bury with them in the above de&s;ign; but the impri&s;onment of Sha$t&s;bury inter|rupted their con&s;ultations. The&s;e, however, were renewed when the new &s;heriffs were impo&s;ed upon the city; in&s;urrections were planned, and corre|&s;pondences e&s;tabli&s;hed in different parts of the kingdom. The confederates depended chiefly on the city of London, which was devoted to Sha$tsbury, who, being afraid of tru&s;ting him&s;elf in any other place, lurked among the citizens, meditating the mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;chemes that bla&s;ted ambition and revenge could dictate. The con&s;pirators met at the hou&s;e of one Shephard, a wine merchant, in the city; they propo&s;ed their friends &s;hould ri&s;e in arms in London, Bri&s;tol, Devon&s;hire, and Che&s;hire. The duke of Monmouth and Sir Thomas Arm&s;trong viewed the guards; and were of opinion that they might be ea&s;ily attacked and reduced. They agreed to a declaration for ju&s;tify|ing their de&s;ign to the public; but the enterprize was delayed in con&s;equence of an intimation from Trenchard, who had undertaken to head the ri&s;ing in the We&s;t, and now gave them to under&s;tand that he could not for &s;ome weeks be ready to take the field. Sha$t&s;bury was &s;o enraged at this delay, as well as intimidated by the authority which the king had e&s;tabli&s;hed in the city, that he retired to Am&s;terdam, where he died very little regretted; though it mu&s;t be allowed, that, notwith&s;tanding all his incon&s;tancy, party rage, di&s;&s;imulation, and ruinous ambition, he was one of the mo&s;t able and upright judges that ever pre&s;ided in the court of chancery.</P>

<P>The chiefs of the con&s;piracy, after his departure, were the duke of Monmouth, the earl of E&s;&s;ex, the lords Ru&s;&s;els and Howard, Algernoon Sidney, and John Hambden, grand&s;on to the famous patriot who oppo&s;ed Charles I. in the tax of &s;hip-money: they corre&s;ponded with Argyle and the malcontents of Scotland, and &s;till re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the &s;cheme of in&s;ur|rection,
<PB N="505" REF="5070">
though they differed widely from each other in their motives. Mon|mouth a&s;pired to the crown; Ru&s;&s;el and Hambden propo&s;ed to exclude the duke of York from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and redre&s;s the grievances of the nation; Sidney was a profe&s;&s;ed republican; E&s;&s;ex &s;eemed to cheri$h the &s;ame principles; and lo$d H$ward was an abandoned nobleman, who &s;ought only to gratify his own intere&s;t and ambition. There was likewi&s;e a &s;et of &s;ubordinate con$pirators, con&s;i&s;ting of colonel Rum&s;ey, an old republican officer; lieutenant-colonel Walcot of the &s;ame &s;tamp; Goodenough, under-&s;heriff of London; Fergu&s;on, an hot-headed, factious, independent mini&s;ter, who had been one of Sha$t&s;|bury's tools; and &s;everal attorneys, merchants, and trade&s;men of London: but of the&s;e none had acce&s;s to the lords, except Rum&s;ey and Fergu&s;on. The inferior order at their meetings embraced the mo&s;t de&s;perate re&s;olutions; they propo&s;ed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king in his way to Newmarket. Rumbald, one of their number, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a farm on that road, called the Rye-Hou&s;e, whence the con&s;piracy was denominated "the Rye-Hou&s;e plot." They deliberated upon &s;topping the king's coach, by overturning a cart in the highway at this place, and &s;hooting him from the hedges. It was likewi&s;e propo&s;ed that his guards &s;hould be engaged by forty hor&s;e under Walcot, while Rum&s;ey &s;hould a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate his per&s;on. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e con&s;ultations the hou&s;e in which the king re&s;ided at Newmarket taking fire, he quitted the place &s;ooner than he intended: &s;o that the con&s;pirators were di&s;appointed in their aim of di&s;patch|ing him on his return to London; and this e&s;cape was afterwards magnified by the courtiers, as an interpo&s;ition of providence. One of the con&s;pirators, who&s;e name was Keiling, finding him&s;elf in danger of a pro&s;ecution for being concerned in arre&s;ting the mayor of London, at the &s;uit of Papillon and Dubois, the two excluded &s;heriffs, re&s;olved to earn his pardon by di&s;covering this plot to the mini&s;try. Colonel Rum&s;ey, and We&s;t a lawyer, no &s;ooner under&s;tood that this man had informed again&s;t them, than they agreed to &s;ave their lives by turning king's evidences, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves accordingly. Shep|hard being apprehended, confe&s;&s;ed all he knew, and warrants were i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the chiefs of the con&s;piracy. Monmouth ab&s;conded, Grey e&s;caped from the me&s;&s;enger by whom he had been arre&s;ted, Ru&s;&s;el was committed to the Tower; Howard, being found concealed in a chimney, was ba&s;e enough to purcha&s;e pardon by betraying his friends: he informed again&s;t E&s;&s;ex, Sidney, and Hambden, who were immediately &s;ecured, and many other con&s;pirators detected and impri&s;oned.</P>

<P>Walcot was fir&s;t brought to trial, and condemned, together with Hone and Rou&s;e, upon the evidence of Rum&s;ey, We&s;t, and Shephard: they died with compo&s;ure, acknowledging the ju&s;tice of the &s;entence by virtue of which they were executed. The &s;ame witne&s;&s;es were produced again&s;t lord Ru&s;&s;el, whom, however, they accu&s;ed with great reluctance. He was the be&s;t beloved nobleman in the kingdom, and even his enemies could not help revere|ing his virtues.

the dutche&s;s of Port&s;mouth with the &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and pounds; lord Ru&s;&s;el's lady, daughter of the earl of Southampton, threw her&s;elf at the king's feet, in a flood of tears, and pleaded the merits of her father in behalf of her hu&s;band. Charles was inexorable; he dreaded the principles and popu|larity of lord Ru&s;&s;el; he deeply re&s;ented that eagerne&s;s and per&s;everance with which he had oppo&s;ed him in the late parliaments; he had even denied the king's power of remitting the barbarous part of the &s;entence pronounced again&s;t lord Stafford. Charles now mitigated his doom into &s;imple decapitation, &s;ay|ing, <Q>&startq;My lord Ru&s;&s;el &s;hall find I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that prerogative which he thought fit to deny me in the ca&s;e of lord Stafford.&endq;</Q> Lord Cavendi&s;h, the intimate friend of Ru&s;&s;el, offered to effect his e&s;cape, by exchanging apparel with him, and remaining a pri&s;oner in his room; the duke of Monmouth &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to him, importing that he would &s;urrender him&s;elf, if he thought that &s;tep would contribute to his &s;afety. Lord Ru&s;&s;el generou&s;ly rejected both the&s;e expedients, and re&s;igned him&s;elf to his fate with admirable fortitude. His lady, that he might not be &s;hocked in his la&s;t moments, &s;ummoned up the re&s;olution of a heroine, and parted from him without &s;hedding a tear. <Q>&startq;Now (cried he$ the bitterne&s;s of death is pa&s;t;&endq;</Q> and afterwards behaved with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;erenity of temper, exhibiting &s;ome extraordinary marks of good humour.

The &s;caffold was erected in Lincoln's-inn-fields, that the triumph of the court might appear the more con&s;picuous in his being conveyed through the whole city of London. Even the populace wept as he pa&s;&s;ed along in the coach with Tillot&s;on and Burnet. On the &s;caffold he pre&s;ented a paper to the &s;heriffs, expre&s;&s;ing his zeal again&s;t popery, prote&s;ting his own innocence with regard to any de&s;ign again&s;t the king's life. He prayed God would pre&s;erve his maje&s;ty, and the prote&s;tant religion; and, without the lea&s;t change of coun|tenance, calmly &s;ubmitted to the &s;troke of the executioner.</P>

<P>The trial of Ru&s;&s;el was followed by that of Algernoon Sidney, brother to the earl of Leice&s;ter, a bold commonwealth's man, in whom the &s;pirit of the antient republics &s;urvived. He had been deeply concerned in the war again&s;t the king's father, though he vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the u&s;urpation of Cromwell. He afterwards u&s;ed all his endeavours to prevent the u&s;urpation, and cho&s;e to live in voluntary exile, until his private affairs required his pre&s;ence in England; then he &s;olicited and obtained the king's pardon. Notwith&s;tand|ing this indulgence, he joined the popular party, and entered eagerly into all their &s;chemes again&s;t the government, in hope of &s;eeing at la&s;t a perfect repu|blic e&s;tabli&s;hed. Lord Howard was the &s;ole witne&s;s that appeared again&s;t him: but the pro&s;ecutors produced &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;es upon Government, found among his papers; and affirmed that the&s;e were equivalent to another evidence. They were written in defence of liberty, maintaining the original contract upon which government was rai&s;ed, and from which all power was derived; the law|fulne&s;s of re&s;i&s;tance, in ca&s;e of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion; and the maxim of pre|ferring a republic to the government of a &s;ingle per&s;on. There was nothing
<PB N="507" REF="5090">
trea&s;onable in the&s;e doctrines. The papers appeared to have been long written. They could neither prove them to be in his hand-writing, nor that he had ever communicated them to any per&s;on upon earth: and he ob&s;erved, in his own de|fence, that in a charge of trea&s;on, the law ab&s;olutely required two living wit|ne&s;&s;es. All the&s;e arguments were urged without effect. A jury had been packed for his trial, and the charge was given again&s;t him with great virulence, by the inhuman Jeffries, now chief-ju&s;tice. He was convicted of cour&s;e, and in a few days executed. He complained of the iniquity of his &s;entence, by which he lo&s;t his life; but, far from denying his connections with Ru&s;&s;el, and the other con&s;pirators, he gloried in his &s;ufferings for the good old cau&s;e, in which, from his early youth, he had been inli&s;ted.</P>

<P>Howard being the &s;ole evidence again&s;t Hambden, this la&s;t was indicted for a mi&s;demeanour only, and ca&s;t in a fine of forty thou&s;and pounds. Holloway, a merchant of Bri&s;tol, one of the con&s;pirators, had fled to the We&s;t Indies, from whence he was now brought back to England. He &s;ubmitted to the king's mercy, and was executed. Sir Thomas Arm&s;trong had been out|lawed for the con&s;piracy, and fled to Holland, where he was betrayed into the hands of Chudleigh the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter, who &s;ent him over to England. He demanded a fair trial, to which he was intitled by the &s;tatute, as the time pre|&s;cribed for his &s;urrendering him&s;elf was not yet elap&s;ed. Jeffries declared he was not intitled to the benefit of the &s;tatute, becau&s;e he had not &s;urrendered voluntarily: he in&s;ulted him from the bench, and condemned him to die the death of a traitor, which he underwent with great re&s;olution. No incident that di&s;tingui&s;hed this period was more remarkable than the death of the earl of E&s;&s;ex, pri&s;oner in the Tower, who, on the morning of Ru&s;&s;el's execution, was found murdered in his apartment, his throat being cut from ear to ear. Though the coroner's inque&s;t brought in their verdict &s;elf-murder, and the earl had been known &s;ubject to fits of melancholy, &s;ome circum&s;tances &s;eemed to counte|nance a &s;u&s;picion of his having fallen by another hand; and that &s;u&s;picion did not even re&s;pect the king and his brother, who happened that morning to be in the Tower, which for many years before they had not vi&s;ited. This, however, is a circum&s;tance which might naturally be interpreted in their favour; for, had they really been concerned in &s;uch an atrocious crime, they would have hardly appeared upon the &s;cene; a &s;tep which could not fail to arrou&s;e the &s;u|&s;picion of the public. Two children declared, that they &s;aw a hand throw a bloody razor from the ca&s;ement. Lady E&s;&s;ex made a very minute inquiry into every circum&s;tance relating to this tragedy, and communicated all the par|ticulars to Dr. Burnet, who &s;ays there was not the lea&s;t foundation for a pro|&s;ecution. He informs us al&s;o, that the earl was not only &s;ubject to gloomy fits of the &s;pleen, but a profe&s;&s;ed advocate for &s;uicide.</P>

<P>The duke of Monmouth had engaged in a corre&s;pondence with the earl of Argyle, by who&s;e means he hoped to be joined, or at lea&s;t favoured by the covenanters in Scotland, who were indeed &s;o cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed by the go|vernment, that any ri&s;que was preferable to the mi&s;ery they endured. Some of their leaders came to London, on pretence of treating with the proprietors of Carolina, and were con&s;ulted by Lord Ru&s;&s;el, and the other noblemen con|cerned in the Rye-hou&s;e plot. Argyle, who then re&s;ided in Holland, under|took to &s;upply the covenanters with arms, if the duke of Monmouth would re|mit
<PB N="508" REF="5100">
eight thou&s;and pounds for that purpo&s;e; and the agents from Scotland promi&s;ed to bring their con&s;tituents into the field. Bailie of Jervi&s;wood, a man of talents and integrity, managed this tran&s;action; and he was apprehended among the per&s;ons concerned in the con&s;piracy. Being &s;ent pri&s;oner to Edin|burgh, he &s;uffered very rigorous treatment during a long confinement; and, as the mini&s;try could find no evidence again&s;t him, they in&s;i&s;ted upon his purging him&s;elf by oath, of all &s;u&s;picion of having been concerned in the Rye-hou&s;e plot, otherwi&s;e they would hold him guilty. He objected again&s;t this impo&s;i|tion, as an act of the mo&s;t inhuman tyranny; he prote&s;ted his innocence and abhorrence of all de&s;igns again&s;t the life of his maje&s;ty: but, he refu&s;ed to an|&s;wer upon oath all the que&s;tions they might propo&s;e. He was therefore fined in &s;ix thou&s;and pounds; and detained in pri&s;on, to the manife&s;t danger of his life. The duke of York was not &s;atisfied with this puni&s;hment. He directed the mini&s;try to &s;earch for evidence again&s;t Bailie; and they employed the mo&s;t un|ju&s;t and &s;candalous means to gratify his revenge: at length the earl of Tarras, who had likewi&s;e been impri&s;oned on account of the con&s;piracy, and Murray of Philiphaugh, were induced by threats to &s;wear that Bailie had tampered with them to ri&s;e in rebellion; and this unhappy gentleman was convicted of trea|&s;on. He was already reduced to the brink of the grave, by hard u&s;age and di|&s;temper; and the judges were &s;o much afraid that death would di&s;appoint the duke's expectation, that they ordered him to be executed immediately after con|demnation. He to the la&s;t denied all knowledge of any de&s;ign again&s;t the king's life, or that of the duke, looked upon death as a deliverance, and died like an old Roman.</P>

<P>The &s;everities exerci&s;ed in the latter parts of this reign were gene|rally a&s;cribed to the influence of the duke, into who&s;e hands the king, from indolence, had re&s;igned the admini&s;tration. The detection of this con&s;piracy furni&s;hed him with the means, not only to cru&s;h the oppo&s;ition, but al&s;o to wreak his vengeance upon his own particular enemies, under the colour of ju|&s;tice. The nation in general con&s;idered the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination-plot with horror, and as the people confounded this with the &s;cheme for an in&s;urrection, the whole party that oppo&s;ed the crown began to lo&s;e their influence. Charles retrieved his popularity, and received the warme&s;t addre&s;&s;es of congratulation from all parts of the kingdom. The univer&s;ity of Oxford te&s;tified their zeal for his per|&s;on and family, by a &s;olemn judgment and decree pa&s;&s;ed in the convocation, again&s;t certain republican maxims and opinions, advanced and defended by Bu|chanan, Milton, Hobbes, Goodwin, Baxter, and other writers. The&s;e they declared damnable and impious doctrines, &s;erving to corrupt the morals and the minds of turbulent people, to excite tumults and rebellions, overturn &s;tates and kingdoms, and encourage regicide and athei&s;m. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e pro|&s;ecutions, the prince&s;s Anne, &s;econd daughter to the duke of York, was mar|ried to prince George, brother to the king of Denmark; and the nuptials were celebrated in London. As this city had not yet formally acknowledged their acquie&s;cence in the &s;entence awarded again&s;t them, the king ordered the judg|ment on the "Quo warranto," to be recorded: then he &s;eized the government into his own hands, and &s;ent a commi&s;&s;ion to William Pritchard, continuing him in the office of mayor during his plea&s;ure. He likewi&s;e confirmed the two

<P>The credit and power of the duke of York were now become ter|rible even to the mini&s;try; and the earl of Hallifax re&s;olved to balance them with another influence. He di&s;covered the place of Monmouth's retreat, and prevailed upon him to &s;end two &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letters to the king, which wakened all the paternal tenderne&s;s of Charles, who permitted him to appear at court, and even endeavoured to mediate a reconciliation between him and the duke of York. He prevailed with him to di&s;clo&s;e the particulars of the con&s;piracy, upon promi&s;e that his te&s;timony &s;hould never be produced again&s;t any of his friends and adherents. He called an extraordinary council, to tell the mem|bers that Monmouth was a &s;incere penitent; and had declared his re&s;olution to avoid all &s;uch criminal de&s;igns for the future: a declaration to this purpo&s;e was in&s;erted in the Gazette. Monmouth finding him&s;elf di&s;graced with all his party by this conduct, no &s;ooner obtained his pardon in form, than he denied he had ever made any &s;uch confe&s;&s;ion. His parti&s;ans believed this a&s;&s;ertion, and declared the whole was a fiction of the mini&s;try. Charles was &s;o provoked by Monmouth's duplicity, that he bani&s;hed him from his pre&s;ence, and afterwards ordered him to quit the kingdom. He retired to Holland, where he was ho|&s;pitably received by the prince of Orange, and afterwards corre&s;ponded with his father, who&s;e fondne&s;s for him revived; though he carefully concealed it from the knowledge of the duke of York. In the month of September, the king &s;ent a fleet, under the command of the earl of Dartmouth, to demoli&s;h the town and ca&s;tle of Tangier, which he could no longer maintain without a par|liamentary &s;upply. The mole was entirely de&s;troyed, and the garri&s;on being brought over to England, helped to form a little army, which was kept up to over-awe the malcontents of the kingdom.</P>

<P>Charles no &s;ooner found him&s;elf at liberty to con&s;ult his own in|clinations, than he dropped all corre&s;pondence with Spain, and renewed his connections with Lewis king of France, again&s;t who&s;e intere&s;t he had never acted without reluctance. Lewis, after the peace of Nimeguen, when other powers di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their forces, kept a great army on foot, dictated to the neigh|bouring &s;tates, and &s;eemed to think him&s;elf within reach of univer&s;al monarchy. He erected chambers at Metz and Bri&s;ac, for enquiring into titles, and re&s;um|ing &s;uch territories as had ever belonged to his new conque&s;ts. The&s;e courts of juri&s;diction &s;ummoned princes to appear before them, and i&s;&s;ued decrees oc|ca&s;ionally, expelling them from their dominions. Lewis took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the free town of Stra&s;burg. He demanded Alo&s;t of the Spaniards; and, in con&s;e|quence of their refu&s;ing to cede that place, reduced Luxemburg. He &s;ent a fleet to bombard Genoa, becau&s;e that &s;tate had &s;tipulated to build &s;ome gallies for the Spaniards; and they were fain to deprecate his re&s;entment by the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions. Spain was &s;o exa&s;perated at the in&s;olence of the French monarch, that without con&s;idering her own weakne&s;s, &s;he declared war again&s;t him; and had the mortification to &s;ee him over-run all the Spani&s;h Nether|lands, without oppo&s;ition. The prince of Orange in vain endeavoured to inte|re&s;t Holland and England in the quarrel. The French intere&s;t prevailed among the &s;tates-general, and Charles had neither means nor inclination to embark in the di&s;pute. The emperor of Germany had oppre&s;&s;ed his Hungarian &s;ubjects
<PB N="510" REF="5120">
in &s;uch a manner, that they were driven to de&s;pair. The French mini&s;ters fo|mented their indignation, and they took arms under count Tekeli. This nobleman finding him&s;elf unable to cope with the whole Imperial power, &s;oli|cited the protection of the Turks, who actually invaded Germany, and pene|trated as far as Vienna, which they inve&s;ted. The king of France a&s;&s;embled an army on the frontiers of the empire, in full confidence that Vienna would be taken, and the emperor ruined; and that the princes of Germany would appeal<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Rap$. R$p$.</NOTE> to him for protection. The city was already reduced to extremity by the grand vizir Cara Mu&s;tapha, at the head of one hundred and thirty thou&s;and men, when John Sobie&s;ky king of Poland, marching to the relief of the place, compelled them to abandon the &s;iege; and, on the &s;econd day of September, defeated them<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>At this period, Charles reigned as ab&s;olute as any monarch in Chri&s;tendom; and his government was fullied with numberle&s;s in&s;tances of partiality and oppre&s;&s;ion. Cruelty was not natural to his di&s;po&s;ition, and there|fore we mu&s;t impute them to the &s;anguinary temper of his brother, which he had not re&s;olution enough to re&s;train. That he di&s;approved of his conduct in many ca&s;es, is highly probable. He appeared di&s;&s;atisfied and unhappy even in the mid&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;s and triumphs over his enemies. He was even heard to &s;ay, <Q>&startq;Brother, I am too old to go again to my travels; you may, if you plea&s;e.&endq;</Q> This expre&s;&s;ion was probably u&s;ed in an&s;wer to &s;ome violent pro|po&s;al of the duke. The earl of Danby was now relea&s;ed upon bail, after a long impri&s;onment. Lord Petre, one of the popi&s;h noblemen, committed on the evidence of Dangerfield, had died in the Tower, after having written a letter to the king; in which he, on the faith of a dying man, prote&s;ted his own in|nocence. The other four were admitted to bail, although the former judges had declared, that it was not in their power to enlarge, upon any &s;ecurity what|&s;oever, a peer of the realm, who had been committed by the parliament. The duke of York was not &s;o favourable to his friends, as implacable towards his enemies. Dutton Colt, who had been member of the three la&s;t parliaments, was accu&s;ed of having called the duke a papi&s;t; of having declared he would be hanged at his own gate, rather than &s;uffer &s;uch a prince to a&s;cend the throne; and of having reviled him with many expre&s;&s;ions of abu&s;e. For the&s;e offences, he was &s;entenced to pay a fine of one hundred thou&s;and pounds. The &s;ame fine was awarded again&s;t Titus Oates, for having &s;aid that the duke was a trai|tor. Two indictments for perjury were laid again&s;t him, but the&s;e were not tried till the next reign; in the mean time he remained in pri&s;on. Since the detection of the Rye-hou&s;e plot, two and thirty per&s;ons were condemed in rui|nous fines, and &s;ome of the&s;e likewi&s;e &s;entenced to the pillory. When Charles had obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the charters that con&s;tituted the corporations in England, he publi&s;hed a declaration, thanking his &s;ubjects, in the mo&s;t affecti|onate terms, for having repo&s;ed &s;uch confidence in their &s;overeign; a&s;&s;uring them he would u&s;e it with moderation, and convince the mo&s;t extravagant re|publicans, that as the crown was the origin of the people's rights, &s;o it was the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>He was actually &s;uppo&s;ed to have planned a total change in his conduct. Tho&s;e who undertake to ju&s;tify or excu&s;e his character, affirm that he intended to emancipate him&s;elf from that intolerable &s;lavery in which he was

held by his brother; to &s;end the duke of York beyond &s;ea, or into Scotland, to recal Monmouth, and a&s;&s;emble a free parliament. If this was the ca&s;e, death anticipated the execution of his laudable de&s;ign. He was &s;uddenly &s;eized with an apoplectic fit; after which he langui&s;hed a few days, and on the &s;ixth of February expired, in the fifty-fourth year of his age, and the twenty-fifth of his reign. Notwith&s;tanding the errors in his conduct, and the blemi&s;hes in his character, he was per&s;onally beloved by the people, who were overwhelmed with grief and a&s;toni&s;hment at his death. This &s;orrow and &s;urpri&s;e, co-ope|rating with the terror of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and the dete&s;tation of popery, ingendered a &s;u&s;picion of his having been taken off by poi&s;on; but this, upon inquiry, appeared without foundation. During his la&s;t illne&s;s, he received the &s;acrament from the hands of a catholic prie&s;t, and died in that communion. Two papers, written with his own hand, in defence of the Romi&s;h religion, were found in his clo&s;et; and the duke imprudently ordered them to be pu|bli&s;hed. They &s;erved no other purpo&s;e than that of &s;tigmatizing the memory of his brother, and confirming the opinion of the public with regard to his own bigotry.</P>

<P>Charles II. was in his per&s;on tall and &s;warthy, and his countenance marked with &s;trong, har&s;h lineaments. His penetration was keen, his judg|ment clear, his under&s;tanding exten&s;ive, his conver&s;ation lively and entertain|ing, and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the talent of wit and ridicule. He was ea&s;y of acce&s;s, po|lite, and affable: had he been limited to a private &s;tation, he would have pa&s;&s;ed for the mo&s;t agreeable and be&s;t-natured man of the age in which he lived. His greate&s;t enemies allow him to have been a civil hu&s;band, an obliging lover, an affectionate father, and an indulgent ma&s;ter: even as a prince, he manife&s;ted an aver&s;ion to cruelty and inju&s;tice. Yet the&s;e good qualities were more than over-balanced by his weakne&s;s and defects. He was a &s;coffer at religion, and a libertine in his morals: carele&s;s, indolent, profu&s;e, abandoned to effeminate plea&s;ure, incapable of any noble enterprize, a &s;tranger to manly friend&s;hip and gratitude; deaf to the voice of honour, blind to the allurements of glory, and in a word, wholly de&s;titute of every active virtue. Being him&s;elf unprincipled, he believed mankind were fal&s;e, per&s;idious and intere&s;ted; and therefore he prac|ti&s;ed di&s;&s;imulation for his own convenience. He was &s;trongly attached to the French manners, government, and monarch: he was di&s;&s;atisfied with his own li|mited prerogative. The majority of his own &s;ubjects, he de&s;pi&s;ed or hated, as hy|pocrites, fanatics, and republicans, who had per&s;ecuted his father and him&s;elf, and &s;ought the de&s;truction of the monarchy. In the&s;e &s;entiments, he could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to pur&s;ue the intere&s;t of the nation; on the contrary, he &s;eemed to think that his own &s;afety was incompatible with the honour and advantage of his people. Had he been an ab&s;olute prince, the &s;ubjects would have found them&s;elves quiet and happy under a mild admini&s;tration; but, harra&s;&s;ed as he was, by a powerful oppo&s;ition, and perplexed with perpetual indigence, he thought him&s;elf obliged, for his own ea&s;e and &s;ecurity, to pro&s;ecute mea&s;ures which rendered his reign a misfortune to the kingdom; and intailed upon him the contempt of all the other powers in Europe. Yet that misfortune did not<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Wellwood. Sheffield. Rapin.</NOTE> immediately affect the nation in its commercial concerns.

This period likewi&s;e produced the immortal Newton, who&s;e $word$ in nature will reflect eternal lu&s;tre on the nation that gave him birth; the learned Stil|ling$lect$ the elegant, the rational Tillot&s;on, be|&s;ides many other excellent divines, &s;uch as Ten|$i&s;on, Patrick, Loyd, and Burnet, who di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf by his hi&s;tory of the reformation. The practice of medicine was greatly improved by the judicious Sydenham. The witty doggre|li&s;t Butler contributed more than any other per|&s;on, by his poem of Hudibras, to bring fanati|ci&s;m into contempt. The king admired this pro|duction, yet left the author to die in ob&s;curity. Dryden &s;hone unrivalled in poetry; but was viti|ous and incorrect from the depravity of the public ta&s;te, and the hurry in which he was obliged to write for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Otway's tragedies are cele|brated above all others, for warmth and pathetic tenderne&s;s. He lived utterly neglected, and died of hunger. Even the courtiers of this reign were in&s;pired with literary ambition. The duke of Buckingham acquired &s;ome reputation by writing the Rehear&s;al, to ridicule the fal&s;e ta&s;te and ab&s;ur|dities of the dramatic writers. Roche&s;ter rendered him&s;elf famous for poignancy of &s;atire and impu|rity. Wycherly di&s;played the genius of true co|medy, though rude and licentions. The earls of Dor&s;et, Ro&s;common, and Mulgrave, wrote with ea&s;e, &s;pirit, and negligence. Hallifax po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed re|fined talents; the writings of Sir William Temple are entertaining and in&s;tructive.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>IMmediately after the decea&s;e of Charles, his brother James was proclaimed in London, without the lea&s;t tumult, or &s;hadow of oppo&s;ition. On the contrary, the people &s;eemed to rejoice at his acce&s;&s;ion. On the fir&s;t day of his reign, he a&s;&s;embled the council at Whitehall. He di&s;claimed arbi|trary principles: declared he would maintain the religion e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, and defend the liberties of his people, for which he had already expo&s;ed his life upon more than one occa&s;ion. His &s;peech was printed and read with uni|ver&s;al applau&s;e. All tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed employments under the late king, were continued in their re&s;pective offices by proclamation: this was another popular &s;tep in the new monarch. The &s;ubjects did not &s;eem much di&s;&s;atisfied even when he went publicly to ma&s;s; but they began to be alarmed at a pro|clamation which he i&s;&s;ued, for continuing the cu&s;toms and exci&s;e, which had been granted to his brother only for life. He ordered Hudle&s;ton to publi&s;h an ac|count of his brother's dying in the Roman catholic faith; and produced the two papers which had been found in his clo&s;et. The funeral of that prince was celebrated without any &s;olemnity, and at a very little expence. The earl of Roche&s;ter was appointed trea&s;urer, his brother Clarendon keeper of the privy|&s;eal; and Hallifax, now a marquis, was created pre&s;ident of the council. The king received congratulatory addre&s;&s;es from all parts of the kingdom, and &s;ome of them couched in the mo&s;t &s;ervile terms of adulation. He and his queen were crowned on the twenty-third day of April, when the populace ob|&s;erved that the royal diadem was too large for his head, and &s;hook from &s;ide to &s;ide; a circum&s;tance from which they deduced a bad omen.</P>

<P>On the day of the coronation, the parliament of Scotland was a&s;&s;embled by the duke of Queen&s;berry, who repre&s;ented the king's per&s;on as commi&s;&s;ioner. That nobleman, though a faithful adherent to the royal family, a&s;&s;ured the king that he could not &s;erve him in any thing that &s;hould contradict the laws of his country. James, in his letter to the Scotti&s;h parliament, inveighed again&s;t the fanatics, whom he termed murderers and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins; and de&s;ired the &s;tates would take proper mea&s;ures to &s;ecure the kingdom again&s;t their machinations. The commi&s;&s;ioner told them, his maje&s;ty was re&s;olved to maintain and protect the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and the liberties of his &s;ubjects; and exhorted them to exterminate the fanatics. The earl of Perth, chancellor of that kingdom, extolled the king's virtues, and afterwards embraced the catholic religion; by which &s;tep he ingratiated him&s;elf &s;o much with James, that he was able to &s;up|plant the duke of Queen&s;berry. The parliament pre&s;ented an abject addre&s;s to the king on his acce&s;&s;ion: they confirmed the act of the preceding reign for maintaining the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion: they annexed the exci&s;e to the crown: they enacted a &s;tatute, decreeing the penalties of trea&s;on and con&s;i&s;cation of goods, not only again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould be pre&s;ent at conventicles, but even again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hould know and yet forbear giving te&s;timony again&s;t traitors and nonconformi&s;ts; and, in a vote which they called an offer of duty, they profe&s;&s;ed their abhorrence of all principles and po&s;itions derogatory to the king's &s;acred, &s;upreme, &s;overeign, ab&s;olute power.</P>

<P>Before the meeting of the Engli&s;h parliament, which had been convo|ked for the nineteenth day of May, Oates was tried in the court of king's bench, upon two indictments of perjury; and convicted upon the evidence of above &s;ixty reputable witne&s;&s;es, nine of whom were prote&s;tants. He was &s;en|tenced to pay a fine of two thou&s;and marks; to be &s;courged through the &s;treets

by the hangman twice in three days; to &s;tand in the pillory at different parts of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter; to undergo this infamy once every year, and be impri&s;oned for life. Jeffries in&s;ulted him from the bench, and the executioner performed his office with great &s;everity. He bore his fate with &s;urpri&s;ing re|&s;olution, prote&s;ting his innocence in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner; was cheri&s;hed and &s;upported by a numerous party, who looked upon him as a martyr to the prote&s;tant religion; and, in the &s;ub&s;equent reign, he obtained his liberty, with a pen&s;ion of four hundred pounds. Dangerfield, being al&s;o convicted of per|jury, was &s;entenced to be &s;courged, and to pay a fine of five thou&s;and pounds. After having undergone this corporal puni&s;hment, one Francis, a &s;tudent in the law, reviled him with &s;ome acrimonious expre&s;&s;ions; to which he replied with &s;uch virulence, as provoked the aggre&s;&s;or to pu&s;h a &s;mall cane into his eye. Dangerfield died in two hours; and Francis, being convicted of the murder, was executed; notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t earne&s;t &s;olicitations of &s;ome per&s;ons of great intere&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; IV.</HEAD>
<P>The parliament having met and cho&s;en their &s;peaker, the king, in his &s;peech to both hou&s;es, repeated the promi&s;es he had made to his council, touching the maintenance of the Engli&s;h church, and the liberties of the people. He demanded a &s;upply for the &s;upport of the fleet and the occa&s;ions of the crown, a&s;&s;uring them that the more liberal they &s;hould be, he would always be the better di&s;po&s;ed to meet them often. He gave them to under&s;tand, that the earl of Argyle had landed in Scotland, with a view to excite a rebellion, for which purpo&s;e he had brought arms and officers from Holland, and publi&s;hed two manife&s;tos, accu&s;ing the king of tyranny and u&s;urpation. The parliament were charmed with the king's &s;peech; and that &s;ame day pre&s;ented an addre&s;s of thanks, in an&s;wer to which, he a&s;&s;ured them they would find him a man of his word. The commons immediately voted, that all the revenues enjoyed by the late king &s;hould be granted to his maje&s;ty for the term of his life; and the upper hou&s;e di&s;charged the earl of Danby and the popi&s;h lords from their bail. They brought in a bill for rever&s;ing the attainder of lord Stafford, on the &s;uppo&s;ition of his having been fal&s;ely accu&s;ed; and it pa&s;&s;ed by a majority, though not without great oppo&s;ition, and a prote&s;tation of tho&s;e lords by whom it was op|po&s;ed. The commons, however, rejected the bill; for how complai&s;ant &s;oever they might be to the king, they had no intention to encourage the Roman catholic party. Not but that the art of corruption had been exerci&s;ed in a &s;hameful manner, to procure &s;uch a parliament as would enter into all the king's mea&s;ures. The boroughs of England, by the &s;eizure of their charters, were left intirely at the mercy of the court, and the corporation-men obliged to choo&s;e &s;uch members as were agreeable to the admini&s;tration. The two hou&s;es voted, that they would a&s;&s;i&s;t the king with their whole power again&s;t the earl of Argyle and all other traitors. The committee for the affairs of religion pre|pared a vote for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the king in defending the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; and another, that his maje&s;ty &s;hould be de&s;ired, in an addre&s;s, to execute the laws again&s;t nonconformi&s;ts: but the&s;e were rejected by the hou&s;e, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they would be di&s;plea&s;ing to the king, who was him&s;elf a nonconformi&s;t. But they unanimou&s;ly pa&s;&s;ed the following vote, That the hou&s;e repo&s;ed it&s;elf intirely on the king's word and declaration, that he would &s;upport and defend the Engli&s;h church as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, which was dearer to them than their

lives. The &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion was u&s;ed in the &s;peaker's &s;peech to the king, when he came to the parliament to pa&s;s the bill for his revenue.</P>

<P>The earl of Argyle, thinking him&s;elf relea&s;ed from the tyes of allegiance by the injuries he had &s;u&s;tained, waited at Am&s;terdam for a favourable oppor|tunity to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection of his countrymen again&s;t James, who was the autho$of his misfortunes. He knew the pre&s;byterians of Scotland were reduced to de&s;pair by oppre&s;&s;ion; and he did not doubt but they would join him at his fir&s;t appearance. He held many conferences with the duke of Monmouth, who was likewi&s;e a refugee in Holland, and very well di&s;po&s;ed to act again&s;t the king of England; and they formed the &s;cheme of a double in&s;urrection. Argyle per&s;uaded the duke to try his fortune among the whigs in the we&s;t of England, who loved him almo&s;t to adoration: but they were de&s;titute of money to forward the undertaking, and Monmouth had received no a&s;&s;urances of being joined at his landing by any per&s;on of con&s;ideration. At length, Ar|gyle, being &s;upplied with a &s;um of money by a rich widow in Am&s;terdam, pur|cha&s;ed arms and ammunition for his enterprize, and &s;et &s;ail for Scotland, after having extorted the duke's promi&s;e that he would make a de&s;cent in England, as &s;oon as he &s;hould hear of Argyle's arrival in the Highlands. This noble|man embarked with &s;ome Scotti&s;h officers; and, on the fifth day of May being off the Orkneys, &s;ent his &s;ecretary on &s;hore to &s;ound the inhabitants, by whom he was detained pri&s;oner. The earl, di&s;appointed in this quarter, failed round to Dun&s;taffnage, an old ca&s;tle on his own e&s;tate, which he converted into a place of arms. He was immediately joined by five and twenty hundred of his own va&s;&s;als and dependants: then he publi&s;hed his manife&s;tos, and wrote cir|cular letters to his friends; but they had been previou&s;ly &s;ecured by an order of council, upon the news of his arrival at the Orkneys. By means of his three &s;hips, and a great number of &s;mall boats, he tran&s;planted his men to the i&s;le of Bu$e, where he remained unactive until he received intelligence that three &s;hips of war and &s;ome frigates were ordered to di&s;tre&s;s him by &s;ea, while the duke of Gordon, the marquis of Athol, and the earl of Arran, advanced again&s;t him by land, at the head of different bodies of forces. Thence he pa&s;&s;ed over into Argyle&s;hire, from whence he marched towards Dumbarton, after having moved his artillery and ammunition into another ca&s;tle, and left a &s;mall garri&s;on for its defence. The place was immediately taken, and his ve&s;&s;els fell into the hands of the enemy: this lo&s;s di&s;couraged him and his followers to &s;uch a de|gree, that they now thought of nothing but providing for their own &s;afety. Finding them&s;elves hotly pur&s;ued from place to place, they di&s;per&s;ed into &s;mall bodies, that they might have the better chance for e&s;caping. The earl him&s;elf, after having been wounded, thought proper to quit his hor&s;e, and was taken by a pea&s;ant, &s;tanding up to his neck in water. Being conducted to Edinburgh, he began to prepare for death with the mo&s;t chearful re&s;ignation; and, in a few days was beheaded, in con&s;equence of his former &s;entence. Rumbold, owner of the Rye-hou&s;e, who had accompanied him in this expedition, together with one Ayla&s;&s;e, nearly allied to the old earl of Clarendon, were brought to trial in London, and condemned. Rumbold denied that the per&s;ons in the Rye-hou&s;e plot had ever formed a re&s;olution to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the king. He laughed at the notion of divine hereditary right: believed that allegiance and protection were reciprocal. He &s;aid he could not think God had made the greater part of
<PB N="517" REF="5190">
mankind with &s;addles on their backs and bridles in their mouths, and a few with boots and &s;purs to ride them at their plea&s;ure. Aylaffe was examined by the king in per&s;on, who exhorted him to di&s;cover their corre&s;pondents in Eng|land, &s;aying, "Mr. Aylaffe, you know it is in my power to pardon you." He boldly replied, that although it was in his power, it was not in his nature: and the king would not di&s;prove the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion; for both were executed.</P>

<P>The duke of Monmouth, according to his promi&s;e, &s;ailed from the Texel with three ve&s;&s;els, on the twenty-fourth day of May, and on the eleventh day of June landed with about four&s;core followers at Lyme in Dor&s;et&s;hire, of which he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without re&s;i&s;tance. Here he publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, conceived in very bitter terms again&s;t the king, whom he reproached as author of the fire of London, of the popi&s;h plot, the murder of Godfrey, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation of E&s;&s;ex, the di&s;&s;olution of parliaments, the &s;ubornation of juries, the mo&s;t flagrant acts of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion. He taxed him with having poi|&s;oned his brother; declared he him&s;elf was come to redre&s;s the grievances of the nation; that his mother had been the lawful wife of Charles; and he in|vited the people to join him in his laudable undertaking. The parliament was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1685.</NOTE> no &s;ooner informed of Monmouth's landing, than they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the king, a&s;&s;uring him of their zeal and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in quelling this rebellion. They be&s;ought him to publi&s;h a proclamation, offering a reward of five thou|&s;and pounds to any per&s;on who &s;hould take the duke dead or alive; and they brought in a bill of attainder again&s;t him; which, in two days, pa&s;&s;ed through both hou&s;es. They likewi&s;e voted a grant to the king of four hundred thou&s;and pounds for his pre&s;ent occa&s;ions: then the parliament was adjourned. The country people flocked to the &s;tandard of Monmouth &s;o fa&s;t, that in two or three days his army was augmented to two thou&s;and men; but he was not joined by any per&s;on of con&s;equence. Receiving intimation that the duke of Albemarle advanced with a &s;trong body of militia to block him up in Lyme, he marched to Axmin&s;ter; and Albemarle retreated with precipitation. At Taunton the duke of Monmouth was received amid&s;t the loud acclamations of the people: his army being con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, he a&s;&s;umed the title of King, and was proclaimed with great &s;olemnity. He then i&s;&s;ued a procla|mation, &s;etting a price upon the head of the duke of York; a &s;econd, declaring the pre&s;ent parliament a &s;editious a&s;&s;embly; and the third, denouncing Albe|marle a traytor. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of June he marched to Bridgwater, where he was likewi&s;e well received, and from thence advanced to the neigh|bourhood of Bri&s;tol, the inhabitants of which were well affected to his per&s;on and de&s;ign; but they were kept in awe by their governor, the duke of Beaufort. Monmouth, under&s;tanding that the king's troops were on the march to give him battle, re&s;olved to retire to Bridgewater. He was refu&s;ed admittance into Bath; but he entered Froome without oppo&s;ition. The king was not a little perplexed and alarmed at his progre&s;s. The regular troops being di&s;per&s;ed through different parts of the kingdom, he ordered the militia of the we&s;tern counties to be rai&s;ed: he recalled &s;ix regiments of Engli&s;h and Scots that were in the &s;ervice of the &s;tates-general. The prince of Orange offered to come over and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in per&s;on; but this offer he declined. Having a&s;&s;embled about three thou&s;and foot and dragoons, he be&s;towed the command of this little army upon the earl of Fever&s;ham, nephew to the famous marechal de Turenne; and

this nobleman took po&s;t at Sedgemore, a village in the neighbourhood of Bridgewater, while the militia of that country was a&s;&s;embled by the dukes of Beaufort, Somer&s;et, Albemarle, and the earl of Pembroke.</P>

<P>Monmouth, who had returned to Bridgewater, finding him&s;elf in danger of being &s;urrounded by the enemy, who&s;e number every day increa&s;ed, re&s;olved to attack the earl of Fever&s;ham at Sedgemore. On the fifth of July, he began his march about eleven at night in profound &s;ilence; but, falling in with Dumbarton's regiment, which happened to be in an advanced po&s;t, they alarmed the royali&s;ts, who were &s;oon provided for his reception. The action began at day-break; and lord Grey, who commanded Monmouth's hor&s;e, was routed at the fir&s;t on&s;et. The duke, at the head of the infantry, maintained his ground with great gallantry, until he was charged in flank by the victorious hor&s;e of the enemy, and his men would no longer &s;tand to their arms. About three hundred were killed in the engagement, and a thou&s;and in the pur&s;uit. He retired with about fifty hor&s;e; but the&s;e &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed, and he rode towards Dor&s;et&s;hire until his hor&s;e could carry him no farther. Then he alighted, and exchanging apparel with a &s;hepherd, fled on foot, attended by a German count, who had accompanied him from Holland. Being quite exhau&s;ted with hunger and fatigue, they lay down in a field, and covered them&s;elves with &s;traw. The &s;hepherd being found in his cloaths, was brought to lord Lumley, who, from his information and the &s;agacity of &s;ome hounds, detected the duke in this forlorn &s;ituation, with raw pea&s;e in his pocket, which he had gathered in the fields to &s;u&s;tain life. His &s;pirit had quite for&s;aken him; and he mani|fe&s;ted the meane&s;t dejection. He wrote a piteous letter to the king, imploring his compa&s;&s;ion; and another to the queen dowager, craving her mediation. She interceded for him, and obtained the king's promi&s;e to give him an audi|ence. At this interview the duke fell upon his knees, and begged his life in the mo&s;t abject terms. James a&s;ked him &s;everal que&s;tions; de&s;ired him to &s;ign a paper, declaring the late king had a&s;&s;ured him that he had never been mar|ried nor contracted to the duke's mother. When he had made this acknow|ledgment, the king told him his crime was of &s;uch a nature, that it could not be pardoned; and, that he had nothing to do but prepare him&s;elf for another world. The queen, who was pre&s;ent, is &s;aid to have in&s;ulted him in the mo&s;t outrageous manner. The duke, perceiving he had nothing to hope from the clemency of his uncle, recollected his &s;pirits, ro&s;e and retired with an air of di&s;dain; neverthele&s;s, he renewed his intreaties for life, and even begged a re|&s;pite for a few days; which was denied. All hope being varni&s;hed, he com|po&s;ed him&s;elf for death, which he encountered with indifference. On the &s;caffold he profe&s;&s;ed his &s;orrow for the blood which had been &s;hed; and de|clared he had ever meaned well to the nation. He touched the ax, and &s;aid, it was not &s;harp enough. He gave the executioner half of what he intended for his reward, telling him his &s;ervant would give the re&s;t, provided he &s;hould perform his part with dexterity, and not behave &s;o burcherly as he had done at the death of lord Ru&s;&s;el. The man was &s;eized with an univer&s;al trepida|tion. When the duke laid down his head and made the &s;ignal, he &s;truck three times ineffectually, and then threw down the ax; but, the &s;heriff compelled him to re&s;ume the work, which with three other &s;trokes he fini&s;hed. The head and body were buried immediately in the chapel of the Tower. Such was the

lamentable fate of James duke of Monmouth, the darling of the Engli&s;h people. He was brave, &s;oft, and gentle, &s;incere, and good-natured, open to &s;lattery, and addicted to plea&s;ure. Lord Grey was al&s;o taken; but he compounded for his life, by paying large &s;ums of money, and di&s;covering all the connections of Monmouth.</P>

<P>The king, however, was not &s;atisfied with the vengeance he had taken. His officers acted with the mo&s;t &s;avage inhumanity towards the pri&s;on|ers that were taken at Sedgemore. Fever&s;ham ordered above twenty to be hanged immediately after the action. Nineteen were put to death in the &s;ame manner at Bridgewater, by colonel Kirke, a brutal &s;oldier who had &s;erved at Tangier. He continued to execute others occa&s;ionally, for his diver&s;ion, with &s;uch circum&s;tances of wanton barbarity as are &s;hocking to human nature. He ravaged the whole country, without making the lea&s;t di&s;tinction between friend or foe. He allowed his &s;oldiers to live upon free-quarter, and his own regi|ment, which was the mo&s;t outrageous, he di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Kirke's lambs; an appellation &s;till remembered with horror in that part of the country. The inhumanity of this ruffian was properly &s;econded by the furious Jeffries, who was &s;ent on the we&s;tern circuit, as another mini&s;ter of the king's vengeance. His natural brutality and thir&s;t of blood were inflamed with continual intoxi|cation. He told the pri&s;oners, that if they would &s;ave him the trouble of try|ing them, they might expect &s;ome favour; otherwi&s;e, he would execute the law upon them with the utmo&s;t &s;everity. Many poor wretches were thus de|coyed into confe&s;&s;ion; but, they found no mercy. He threatened juries, in|timidated witne&s;&s;es, rejected all interce&s;&s;ion, and &s;eemed to take plea&s;ure in the work of death. At Dorche&s;ter, he ordered nine and twenty per&s;ons to be exe|cuted immediately after conviction. In this town two hundred and ninety-two received &s;entence of death. He pro&s;ecuted the &s;ame work of carnage at Exeter and Taunton. Two hundred and fifty per&s;ons were in this circuit &s;a|crificed, under colour of ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>Lady Li&s;le, widow of one of the regicides, tho' her&s;elf a loyali&s;t, was apprehended, in extreme old age, for having &s;heltered in her hou&s;e two fugi|tives from the battle of Sedgemore. She proved that &s;he had ordered her &s;ervant to carry an information again&s;t them to the next ju&s;tice of the peace, as &s;oon as &s;he knew in what enterprize they had been engaged. Twice the jury declared her not guilty. Jeffries &s;ent them back with dreadful menaces; and at la&s;t they were intimidated into a verdict, by which &s;he lo&s;t her life. In vain was interce&s;|&s;ion made for this aged matron. The king lent a deaf ear to all that could be &s;aid in her behalf; and &s;he &s;uffered an ignominious death. One of the rebels having e&s;caped to London, took refuge in the hou&s;e of Mrs. Gaunt an ana|bapti&s;t, who&s;e life was one continued exerci&s;e of benevolence. She concealed and maintained this fugitive, who was &s;uch an abandoned villain, that he in|formed again&s;t his protectre&s;s, for the reward and indemnity offered in a pro|clamation to tho&s;e who &s;hould di&s;cover delinquents. He was pardoned and recompenced for his traachery; and &s;he was burned alive for her beneficence.

<P>Nothing could be more flouri&s;hing than the king's pre&s;ent &s;ituation. He had quelled two dangerous rebellions; trampled faction under foot; and ob|tained a parliament that complied with all his de&s;ires. He &s;aw a &s;tanding army at his beck; heard the doctrines of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and nonre&s;i&s;tance ecchoed from every corner, as articles of the Engli&s;h creed; and found him&s;elf courted by foreign &s;tates, as a prince who had it in his power to regulate the intere&s;ts of Europe. But, he had nothing &s;o much at heart as the conver&s;ion of his people to the catholic religion. His own zeal was in this particular reinforced by that of the queen, who was a bigotted Italian, and continually whetted by the importunities and exhortations of &s;ome hot-brained je&s;uits, who had ac|quired the mo&s;t ab&s;olute influence and tyranny over his con&s;cience. His brother, even in his la&s;t agonies, di&s;&s;uaded him from endeavouring to re&s;tore the catholic religion in England, becau&s;e he thought it was a &s;cheme extremely hazardous, and even impracticable. Don Pedro Ronquillo the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, in his fir&s;t audience ob&s;erved to him, that he &s;aw a great number of prie&s;ts about his maje&s;ty's per&s;on; he therefore took the liberty to caution him again&s;t their im|portunities, le&s;t he &s;hould repent of having li&s;tened to them, when it would be too late. The king took ami&s;s the freedom of his advice; and a&s;ked, with an air of di&s;content, if the king of Spain con&s;ulted with prie&s;ts. <Q>&startq;Yes, (re|plied Ronquillo) and for that rea&s;on our affairs are &s;o unpro&s;perous?&endq;</Q> Pope Innocent XI. in a brief to James on his acce&s;&s;ion, after having commended his zeal for the catholic religion, expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ion that it might carry him too far; and, in&s;tead of contributing to the advancement of his own affairs, and the intere&s;t of religion, be of extreme prejudice of both. Notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e cautions, he re&s;olved to proceed with his enterprize; as a previous &s;tep to which he thought it would be nece&s;&s;ary to render him&s;elf ab&s;olute, and then he &s;hould be able to employ the mo&s;t effectual means of converting his &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>The duke of Ormond, who had de&s;erved better of the royal family than any &s;ubject in the king's dominions, and was in all re&s;pects a nobleman of un|blemi&s;hed honour, had for &s;ome time governed Ireland as lord-lieutenant. Being a con&s;cientious prote&s;tant, he was now recalled. The king appointed a new privy-council for that kingdom, and many members were catholics; the&s;e daily increa&s;ed, until they became the majority. The prote&s;tants were now &s;can|dalou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed, on pretence of their favouring Monmouth's rebellion; and at length, the militia was wholly di&s;armed. Colonel Talbot, a furious papi&s;t, was impowered to model the army; and he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the greater part of the prote&s;tant officers, filling their places with tho&s;e of his own religion. After

having performed this &s;ignal &s;ervice, he came over to England, where he was created earl of Tyrconnel, and lieutenant-general of the Iri&s;h army, while the earl of Clarendon was appointed lord-lieutenant of the kingdom.</P>

<P>The king's next &s;tep was to augment his &s;tanding army from &s;even thou&s;and to fifteen thou&s;and men. When the parliament met on the ninth day of November, he told them he had found by experience a militia altogether u&s;ele&s;s, and &s;uch a &s;tanding force ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the peace of the kingdom. He therefore demanded a proportionable &s;upply for their main|tenance. With re&s;pect to the catholic officers whom he had employed, he &s;aid, they were men of approved fidelity; and that, after having enjoyed the benefit of their &s;ervices, in times of danger and difficulty, he would not expo&s;e them to misfortune, nor him&s;elf to the nece&s;&s;ity of being without them, in ca&s;e of an|other rebellion. He concluded with a declaration, that he would ri&s;que his life for the true intere&s;t of the kingdom; and therefore he hoped, there would be no interruption of the harmony &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and his parliament. The two hou&s;es, notwith&s;tanding their exce&s;&s;ive loyalty, began to be alarmed at the king's large &s;trides towards popery and arbitrary power. In the hou&s;e of lords, the motion for an addre&s;s of thanks to the king for his &s;peech met with great oppo&s;ition; and though it pa&s;&s;ed by a &s;mall majority, the hou&s;e re&s;olved to take the &s;peech into further con&s;ideration. When it was read in the hou&s;e of commons, a profound &s;ilence en&s;ued. This was interrupted by the earl of Middleton &s;ecretary of &s;tate, who moved for an addre&s;s of thanks to his maje&s;ty. After a &s;econd pau&s;e, lord Ca&s;tleton oppo&s;ed the motion; and the con&s;ideration of it was referred till the twelfth day of November. Then they debated with great freedom upon the con&s;equences of a &s;tanding army, and the demand of a further &s;upply, after &s;o much had been given. But, the intere&s;t of the court predominated, and &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds were voted for the maintenance of the forces. Their complai&s;ance, however, gave way to their fears, when they con&s;idered that article of the &s;peech in which the king frankly told them, he had di&s;pen&s;ed with the laws in favour of popi&s;h officers. In this addre&s;s, they thanked him for having quelled the rebellions; but, they repre&s;ented that the te&s;t-act rendered popi&s;h recu&s;ants incapable of exerci&s;ing any employment under the government. That as his maje&s;ty had mentioned the &s;ervices of the Roman catholic officers, they would prepare a bill for exempting them from the penalties they had incurred; but, as by continu|ing them in their employments, he a&s;&s;umed the power of di&s;pen&s;ing with the laws; a power of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence with re&s;pect to the liberties of the people, and the &s;ecurity of religion; they humbly be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to give orders for quieting intirely the fears of his faithful &s;ubjects. To this addre&s;s the king replied, That he did not expect &s;uch a remon&s;tance from the commons, after he had demon&s;trated the advantages that would ari&s;e from a perfect union between him and his parliament; but, he declared that in whatever &s;hape they might abu&s;e the confidence which he had repo&s;ed in them, he &s;hould &s;till pun|ctually perform the promi&s;es he had made. This an&s;wer &s;truck them with &s;uch a panic, that not a word was &s;poken for &s;ome time after they returned to their hou&s;e. At length Cook member for Derby ro&s;e up, &s;aying, <Q>&startq;I hope we are all true-born Engli&s;hmen; and that a few hard words are incapable

They began to deliberate on ways and means for rai&s;ing the &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds which they had granted; and, in order to appea&s;e the king, they re&s;olved to bring in a bill, impowering him to name a certain number of catholic officers to &s;erve in the army. But as he could not obtain the extent of his wi&s;hes, he in a few days prorogued the parliament: the prorogation was continued from time to time, and at length it was totally di&s;&s;olved.</P>

<P>The earl of Stamford and lord Delamere had been committed to the Tower in July, upon a general accu&s;ation of trea&s;on, and debarred all inter|cour&s;e with their friends, by word or writing. They found means, however, to petition the hou&s;e of lords, which de&s;ired the king would be plea&s;ed to de|clare the cau&s;e of their impri&s;onment. He told them tho&s;e two lords were accu&s;ed of trea&s;on; and that he had given orders for trying lord Delamere in Che&s;hire, where the crime was &s;aid to have been committed. As he did not &s;ig|nify his intention with regard to the earl of Stamford, the lords ordered that nobleman to be tried by his peers, with the con&s;ent of his maje&s;ty. Delamere<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Rapin. R$$ph.</NOTE> was likewi&s;e tried in the &s;ame manner, contrary to the king's fir&s;t re&s;olution. The lords Howard and Grey, with another infamous informer, were produced in evidence again&s;t him.

The earl of Stamford they admitted to bail, and he afterwards availed him&s;elf of a general pardon, which the king granted by proclamation, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ucceeding year. By this time the earl of Arlington was dead, and his place of chamberlain be|&s;towed upon the earl of Mulgrave, who acquired a great &s;hare of the king's favour.

He revoked the edict of Nantz, by which Henry IV. had &s;ecured his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects in the exerci&s;e of their religion. This law, which had been declared irrevocable, he repealed; and per&s;ecuted tho&s;e unhappy people with &s;uch &s;everity and inju&s;tice, that above half a million of his mo&s;t indu&s;trious &s;ubjects fled from their native country into other realms, where they could enjoy liberty of con&s;cience. Together with great &s;ums of money, they exported from France tho&s;e arts and manufactures by which that kingdom had been enriched. Fifty thou&s;and of the&s;e refugees arrived in England, and were ho&s;pitably received by James, who treated them with great humanity; and affected to exclaim again&s;t the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit of the French monarch.

<P>In Scotland the parliament was a&s;&s;embled by the earl of Moray, who in complai&s;ance to the king had changed his religion. He delivered to them a letter from his maje&s;ty, recommending to their care and humanity his poor ca|tholic &s;ubjects, who had always been faithful to the crown, that they might enjoy the protection of the laws, without taking oaths that were repugnant to their con&s;ciences and religion. This letter produced violent debates. At length, a bill was brought in for indulging catholics with the private exerci&s;e of their wor&s;hip; but it was violently oppo&s;ed and deferred to further con&s;ideration. Then the king ordered the commi&s;&s;ioner to prorogue the parliament; and, by virtue of his own prerogative, e&s;tabli&s;hed liberty of con&s;cience through the whole kingdom. His power in Ireland was no le&s;s ab&s;olute. Tyrconnel had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed almo&s;t the whole number of prote&s;tants that were in the army; and encroached &s;o much on the civil government, that Clarendon was left ab&s;olutely de&s;titute of authority. At la&s;t this nobleman was recalled, and Tyrconnel appointed lord-lieutenant. This was a ferocious bigot, who exerci&s;ed &s;uch acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, and encouraged the catholics to &s;uch a pitch of in&s;olence and power, that the di&s;armed prote&s;tants expected another ma&s;&s;acre. Many thou|&s;ands relinqui&s;hed their lands and effects, and came over to England, where they could be &s;heltered from the barbarity of &s;uch a tyrant; and the merchants of England who traded to that kingdom, withdrawing their effects, the country was reduced to un&s;peakable di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>In England, the king pro&s;ecuted his de&s;ign more gradually. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed four judges, who refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;ert his di&s;pen&s;ing power, and filled their places with &s;uch as promi&s;ed to be more ductile. He re&s;olved to put their obe|dience to immediate proof. The coachman of Sir Edward Hales, a new pro&s;elyte, was directed to inform again&s;t him as a popi&s;h recu&s;ant employed in quality of co|lonel in the &s;ervice. He was pro&s;ecuted for the &s;um of five hundred pounds, and pleaded the king's di&s;pen&s;ing power. The plea was argued with great learning and vivacity before the judges, who gave it as their opinion, that the di&s;pen&s;ing power was a prerogative in&s;eparable from the kings of Eng|land. Thus all the fences to the con&s;titution were at once thrown down. The king now admitted four popi&s;h lords into his council, namely, the lords Arun|del of Wardour, Bella&s;is, Dover, and the earl of Tyrconnel. The catholic wor&s;hip was publicly performed, and the je&s;uits erected colleges in different parts of the kingdom. Four catholic bi&s;hops, con&s;ecrated in the king's chapel, were &s;ent through the kingdom, to exerci&s;e their epi&s;copal functions, under the title of apo&s;tolic vicars. Their pa&s;toral letters were printed by the king's printer, and di&s;tributed through all the different counties. The monks appeared at court in the habits of their orders; and a great number of prie&s;ts and friars arrived in England. The whole admini&s;tration was managed by catholics. The king &s;ent a circular letter to the bi&s;hops, ordering them to prohibit their inferior clergy from preaching on points of controver&s;y; a practice which &s;erved only to foment animo&s;ities. But, this injunction was very little regarded by the prote&s;tant divines, who &s;eeing their religion in &s;uch imminent danger, ex|po&s;ed the errors, ab&s;urdities, and cruelty of the catholic communion, with &s;uch learning, energy, and candour, as operated powerfully on the conviction of the public; and redounded to the immortal honour of tho&s;e virtuous champions, the chief of whom were Tillot&s;on, Stillingfleet, Teni&s;on, Patrick, and Sherlock.</P>

<P>The king and his council were &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed with tho&s;e endeavours, &s;o expre&s;ly contrary to the royal mandate, that they were re&s;olved to e&s;tabli&s;h a new eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion-court that &s;hould enforce obedience. This was accordingly in&s;tituted, and compo&s;ed of &s;ecular as well as eccle&s;ia&s;tical members, among whom were &s;ome catholics. The prelates were the archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury, and the bi&s;hops of Durham and Roche&s;ter; but the metropolitan never took his place. Jeffries, now created a peer and lord chancellor of England, was one of the lay-members: &s;uch al&s;o were the earls of Roche&s;ter and Sunder|land. They were impowered to exerci&s;e all &s;orts of eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction; to corect abu&s;es in the &s;piritual laws, enquire into all offences, puni&s;h delinquents by cen&s;ure, excommunication, &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and depo&s;ition; to examine &s;tatutes, rules, and charters of colleges, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical communities; and make &s;uch corrections and alterations as they &s;hould think proper. Doctor Sharp having preached at St. Anne's church upon a point of controver&s;y, the king, in a letter to the bi&s;hop of London, defired he might be &s;u&s;pended. The prelate repre|&s;ented, that there was no law for &s;u&s;pending a clergyman without a legal trial. Sharp him&s;elf pre&s;ented a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive petition to the king, of which no notice was taken. The bi&s;hop of London had propo&s;ed in the hou&s;e of lords to examine the king's la&s;t &s;peech to his parlia#ment; and was therefore extremely odious to the mini&s;try. Being &s;ummoned before the new eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, he declined their juri&s;diction, affirming, that as a bi&s;hop he was &s;ubject to the metropolitan alone. His plea was over-ruled; he was &s;u&s;pended from all epi&s;copal functions, for having di&s;obeyed the king's order; and the bi&s;hops of Durham, Roche&s;ter, and Peterborough, were ve&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of his dioce&s;e.</P>

<P>This deci&s;ion excited loud clamours among the people, who were &s;till more irritated, when they &s;aw an army of fifteen thou&s;and men encamped on Houn&s;low-heath in time of profound peace. A mini&s;ter, who&s;e name was John&s;on, publi&s;hed a paper, addre&s;&s;ed to the officers and &s;oldiers, repre&s;enting the guilt the ba&s;ene&s;s, and infamy, of &s;erving as in&s;truments to de&s;troy the religion and con&s;titution of their country. The author, being tried in the court of king's-bench, for having written a &s;editious libel, was convicted, fined in five hundred marks, &s;et in the pillory, &s;courged from Newgate to Tyburn, and &s;olemnly degraded: neverthele&s;s, his performance produced a wonderful effect upon the &s;oldiery. Miles France, the informer, was now tried and con|victed of perjury: but his puni&s;hment was remitted, in con&s;ideration of his having voluntarily retracted his evidence, by which three innocent men had lo&s;t their lives: perhaps he would not have been &s;o gently u&s;ed, had not he profe&s;&s;ed the Roman catholic religion. The king became every day more and more ambitious of making converts. Sunderland &s;acrificed his religion to his intere&s;t, though he would not make a public abjuration. The earl of Roche&s;ter con&s;ented to a conference with &s;ome popi&s;h prie&s;ts; but declared him&s;elf di&s;&s;a|tisfied with their arguments, and refu&s;ed to change. He lo&s;t his office of trea&s;urer, which was put in commi&s;&s;ion; but he was gratified with a con|&s;iderable pen&s;ion. The king deprived his brother Clarendon of the privy-&s;eal, which was given to lord Arundel. He conde&s;cended &s;o far as to exhort Kirke to become a pro&s;elyte. That ru&s;&s;ian told him he was pre-engaged; for he had promi&s;ed to the king of Morocco, that &s;hould he ever change his religion, he would turn Mahometan.</P>

<P>James, to crown all his endeavours in behalf of the catholic com|munion, &s;ent the earl of Ca&s;tlemain with a &s;plendid emba&s;&s;y to the pope, to acknowledge the king's &s;piritual obedience to his holine&s;s, and reconcile his kingdoms to the catholic religion. This nobleman was received at Rome with the mo&s;t mortifying indifference. Innocent was at variance with the French king. He looked upon James as the parti&s;an and pen&s;ioner of this monarch. He dreaded the effects of his frantic zeal, and knew his connections with the je&s;uits, whom Innocent dete&s;ted. Though he granted audiences to the amba&s;&s;ador, he always pretended to be &s;eized with a fit of coughing, which interrupted the earl's &s;peech, and obliged him to retire. At length he complained loudly of this contemptuous treatment, and threatened to return. The pope, in an&s;wer to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Rapin.

All that he could obtain was a di&s;pen&s;ation for father Peters, the king's confe&s;&s;or, permitting him to enjoy a bi&s;hopric, which, however, he did not obtain.

<P>James, notwith&s;tanding all di&s;couragements, &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his fa|vourite<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1687.</NOTE> de&s;ign of converting the three kingdoms; and finding him&s;elf de&s;erted by the church-party, he affected to care&s;s the pre&s;byterians. He &s;ent a declaration to Scotland, granting full liberty of con&s;cience to all his &s;ubjects of that king|dom, by virtue of his &s;overeign authority, his royal prerogative, and his ab&s;o|lute power, which all his people were bound to obey, without re&s;erve or re&s;tric|tion. He, by the &s;ame power, annulled all laws enacted again&s;t Roman catho|lics; and abrogated all oaths by which nonconformi&s;ts were rendered incap|able of tru&s;t and office. The covenanters were not a little rejoiced, to find them&s;elves delivered all at once from tho&s;e re&s;trictions in &s;pirituals, of which they had &s;o long complained; and the council thanked the king, in the name of the whole nation, for this mark of his princely clemency and indulgence. The &s;ucce&s;s of this mea&s;ure in Scotland, encouraged him to practi&s;e the &s;ame expedient in England. Accordingly, on the fourth day of April, he publi&s;hed a declaration for liberty of con&s;cience to the &s;ame effect, though he mentioned his ab&s;olute power in more moderate terms, and &s;aid he did not doubt of its meeting with the approbation of the parliament. It was &s;o agreeable to all the nonconformi&s;ts, that he received the warme&s;t addre&s;&s;es of thanks from the anabapti&s;ts, quakers, independents, and pre&s;byterians. In the&s;e they extolled the regal power, which they had &s;o long endeavoured to aba&s;e. They trium|phed over the churchmen, and publi&s;hed many virulent invectives again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed form of di&s;cipline. The king fomented this difference between two parties, to which he was equally aver&s;e. In private conver&s;ation, he talked of nothing but the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion to which the nonconformi&s;ts had been &s;ubjected by the church of England. He pur&s;ued this artifice &s;o far as to give order for a revi&s;ion of the &s;uits which had been in&s;tituted in the eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal courts again&s;t the di&s;&s;enters. But this animo&s;ity was of &s;hort duration; they &s;oon perceived the king's drift, and all their mutual re&s;entment &s;ub&s;ided. Some of the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops were &s;o abject, as to influence their inferior clergy to &s;end flattering addre&s;&s;es upon the declaration. Crew of Durham, Barlow of Lincoln, Cartwright of Che&s;ter, Wood of Litchfield and Coventry, and Wat|&s;on

<P>The king having hitherto &s;ucceeded even beyond his own expecta|tion, re&s;olved to open a way for the Roman catholics, into the church and uni|ver&s;ities of England. He recommended father Francis, a benedictine monk, to the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, for the degree of ma&s;ter of arts. They per|ceived all the dangerous con&s;equences of &s;uch an admi&s;&s;ion. They pre&s;ented a petition, be&s;eeching the king to revoke his mandate. They &s;ent a deputation to London, with a remon&s;trance on the &s;ame &s;ubject. Their petition was di&s;|regarded; their deputies were denied a hearing. The vice-chancellor was &s;um|moned to appear before the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court. He was deprived of his office; yet the univer&s;ity &s;till refu&s;ed to admit Francis, and the king thought proper to de&s;i&s;t from his purpo&s;e. His attempt upon Oxford he pro&s;ecuted with more per&s;everance. The place of pre&s;ident in Magdalen-college being vacant, he &s;ent a mandate in favour of one Farmer, a new convert, who&s;e character, in other re&s;pects, lay under imputation. They petitioned the king that they might be allowed to chu&s;e their own pre&s;ident, according to the &s;tatutes of the col|lege; or that his maje&s;ty would recommend a per&s;on properly qualified for &s;uch an important office. As no an&s;wer was made to this remon&s;trance, the fellows of the college elected Dr. Hough, a man of learning, integrity, and re&s;olution. The king was incen&s;ed at their pre&s;umption. The vice-pre&s;ident and the fel|lows were cited before the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, for having di&s;obeyed the king's order. They repre&s;ented, that they were re&s;trained from chu&s;ing Farmer by their &s;tatutes, and the nature of the oath they had taken. They proved Far|mer in every &s;hape unqualified for &s;uch an office. Notwith&s;tanding their de|fence, the court decreed that the new pre&s;ident &s;hould be deprived of his office; and that the vice-pre&s;ident and one of the fellows &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended. But, the king being informed of what had appeared to the prejudice of Farmer's cha|racter, &s;ent another mandate in favour of Parker bi&s;hop of Oxford, who was as pro&s;tigate as the other. The fellows refu&s;ed to comply with this injunction. The king repaired in per&s;on to Oxford, and the fellows were brought into his pre&s;ence. He reproached them with their in&s;olence and di&s;obedience, in the mo&s;t imperious terms; and commanded them to chu&s;e the bi&s;hop of Oxford their pre&s;ident, without further delay. They pre&s;ented a petition, which he would not receive; and Parker was &s;till rejected. He afterwards e&s;tabli&s;hed an inferior commi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it Magdalen-college. The chiefs of this delegation, were Cartwright bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, and one of the judges. They endeavoured to intimidate the fellows into compliance by menaces: but, finding them re&s;o|lute, they propo&s;ed an expedient for &s;aving the king's honour by means of a declaration, which the members of the college were willing to &s;ub&s;cribe. The king was not &s;atisfied with this medium. He in&s;i&s;ted upon their owning their contempt of his order, and promi&s;ing they would comport them&s;elves with more re&s;pect for the future. He demanded that they &s;hould acknowledge the ju&s;tice and legality of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, implore his forgivene&s;s upon their knees, and &s;ubmit to the bi&s;hop of Oxford as their pre&s;ident. Tho&s;e conditi|ons being rejected by all the fellows, except Charnock, and one other; the re|cu&s;ants were, by the &s;entence of the commi&s;&s;ioners, expelled from the college,
<PB N="527" REF="5290">
and deprived of their fellow&s;hips. This judgment was affirmed by the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical court, which moreover decreed, that the pre&s;ident and the fellows &s;hould be declared incapable of holding eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices. Notwith&s;tand|ing this &s;entence, the pre&s;ident refu&s;ed to quit his hou&s;e, until he was forcibly expelled. Then the college was filled with catholics, and Charnock appointed vice-pre&s;ident.</P>

<P>This flagrant inva&s;ion of the laws and religion of the kingdom proved one of the mo&s;t unpopular acts of the king's whole reign: but, indeed, by this time he had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s towards ab&s;olute dominion, and had &s;ome rea&s;on to think the nation in general acquie&s;ced in its &s;lavery; for he was flattered even in his highe&s;t preten&s;ions by the clergy, the laity, and all &s;orts of communities; among the&s;e the &s;ociety of the Temple di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by a ful&s;ome addre&s;s, in which they declared, that the prerogative being the gift of God, no earthly power could dimini&s;h it, and that it nece&s;&s;arily remained entire and in&s;eparably attached to his royal per&s;on. Yet the tory parliament, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive as they were in the beginning, and attached to the king by the ties of affection, could never be brought to a compliance with his ultimate de&s;igns upon the religion and con&s;titution of their country. He had di&s;po&s;ed of all the great employments to per&s;ons of his own communion. The ju&s;tices of the peace were either catholics, or prote&s;tants devoted to his will; and they em|ployed all their influence in e&s;tabli&s;hing the king's di&s;pen&s;ing power. James intended to call a new parliament, and began to take mea&s;ures for the election of &s;uch members as would pay an implicit obedience to his commands. He clo&s;eted individuals, and endeavoured to convince them of the nece&s;&s;ity for aboli&s;hing penal laws. He employed arguments, threats and promi&s;es alter|nately. The &s;ame methods were practi&s;ed by his mini&s;ters, deputy-lieutenants, judges, and ju&s;tices, in different parts of the kingdom. Writs of Quo Warranto were i&s;&s;ued again&s;t &s;ome refractory corporations, which were obliged to &s;ubmit to his commands; and he him&s;elf made a progre&s;s through &s;everal counties, in order to intimidate and cajole the people. But all his endeavours proved un|&s;ucce&s;sful: he met with nothing but coldne&s;s, reluctance, and di&s;affection; &s;o that he would not hazard the meeting of a new parliament.</P>

<P>The pope had, in the preceding year, conferred the dignity of nuncio upon Ferdinand Dada, who had re&s;ided privately in England, and at|tended the king's per&s;on ever &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne.

On the third day of July, this prie&s;t made his public entry into Wind&s;or, in his pontificals, preceded by the cro&s;s, and attended by a great number of monks, in the ha|bits of their re&s;pective orders. The duke of Somer&s;et being lord of the bed|chamber in waiting, refu&s;ed to conduct the nuncio to an audience, alledging<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Welwood.

In order to &s;ound the prince, he employed one Stuart, who was acquainted with Fagel the pen&s;ionary, to a&s;&s;ure this coun&s;ellor, in a letter, that the intere&s;t of Eng|land, as well as of the prince, required the abolition of the te&s;t and penal laws. As Fagel made no reply to this addre&s;s, Stuart renewed the attack in a &s;econd and third letter; till at length, tired by the pen&s;ionary's &s;ilence, he gave them to under&s;tand, that the king had employed him to write, and de&s;ired to know the &s;entiments of the prince on this &s;ubject.

<P>Their opinion was &s;upported by very clear and convincing rea&s;ons, which, while they irritated the king again&s;t his &s;on$in-law, &s;erved to confirm great part of the nation in the re&s;olution which they had lately taken to $ppo&s;e the arbitrary de&s;igns of the m$$i&s;try. They began to perceive that the kingdom would infallibly be reduced to &s;lavery, and the prote&s;tant religion extingui&s;hed, unle&s;s they &s;hould engage in &s;ome &s;peedy and effectual mea&s;ures for their own pre&s;ervation. They turned their eyes upon the prince of Orange; and &s;ome were inclined to wait patiently, until the prince&s;s &s;hould &s;ucc$ed to the throne by the cour&s;e of nature: but they bani&s;hed tho&s;e forbearing m$xi$s, when a proc$$$$tion was publi&s;hed, declaring the queen's pregnancy, and ordaining a day of thank&s;giving for the occa&s;ion. The&s;e tidings filled the catholics with exce&s;&s;ive joy, and the re&s;t of the nation with the mo&s;t di&s;mal pre&s;ages. The je&s;uits were bold enough to proph$cy that the queen would bring forth a $on. They pretended her conception was the miraculous effect of vows made by her and her mother to the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and our lady of Loretto. Ad|$re&s;&s;es of congratulation were immediately wa&s;ted to the king from $ll cor|ners of the i&s;land, as if the whole nation had thought the birth of a prince would be a public ble&s;&s;ing. But the&s;e addre&s;&s;es were procured by the emi&s;|&s;aries of the mini&s;try. All the prote&s;tants in the kingdom were alarmed, as at the eve of a terrible calamity. A great number fondly believed that the queen's pregnancy was counterfeit. She had been for &s;ome years in an ill $tate of health; and this circum&s;tance, con&s;idered through the medium of pa&s;|&s;ion, &s;ugge$$ed the belief of an impo&s;ture. Before James a&s;cend$d thethr$ne, this lady had been pregnant, and at that time her enemies circulated a report of

<P>The king was &s;o elevated with this pro&s;pect of male $word$ that he &s;eemed to &s;et the prince of Orange at defiance. He di&s;olaimed the cor|re&s;pondence between Stuart and Fagel: he $word$ the Algeri$es, who were at war with the Dutch: he recalled the &s;ix Briti&s;h regiments that were in the &s;ervice of the &s;tates-general: he augmented his navy, and &s;eemed to wait for nothing but a pretence to declare war again&s;t Holland. The &s;tates, in an&s;wer to his demand, repre&s;ented, that, by treaties, they were not obliged to part with the regiments, except when he &s;hould be at war with &s;ome foreign power, or in ca&s;e of an actual rebellion in his dominions. He renewed his demand; they pleaded the letter of the treaty: at length he publi&s;hed a pro|clamation, recalling all his &s;ubjects that were in the &s;ervice of the &s;tates-gene|ral. The prince of Orange offered pa&s;&s;ports to &s;uch Engli&s;h or Scotti&s;h offi|cers as de&s;ired to quit the &s;ervice; and, by this expedient, purged the troops of tho&s;e individuals in who&s;e attachment and fidelity he could not con&s;ide.</P>

<P>James, in order to demon&s;trate the con&s;tancy of his councils, and his contempt for the malcontents of the kingdom, publi&s;hed another de|claration, granting liberty of con&s;cience, and aboli&s;hing the penal laws. At the &s;ame time the bi&s;hops were enjoined, by an order of council, to cau&s;e this declaration to be read in all the churches of their different dio$e&s;es. This &s;cheme was calculated to mortify the church of England, again&s;t which he was remarkably irritated, and to en&s;nare the bi&s;hops into the guilt of di&s;|obedience, unle&s;s they would become the in&s;truments of his de&s;igns again&s;t the prote&s;tant religion. Loyd bi&s;hop of St. A&s;aph, Ker of Bath and Wells, Turner of Ely, Lake of Chiche&s;ter, White of Peterborough, and Tre|lawny of Bri&s;tol, being then in London, no &s;ooner received the&s;e orders, than they ha&s;tened to Lambeth, to con&s;ult with Sancroft archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. There they deliberated upon the &s;ubject; and agreed in opinion, that they could not obey the king's command, without betraying their con&s;ciences, and their duty to God and their country. They therefore drew up and &s;igned a pe|tition to the king, repre&s;enting their unwillingne&s;s to be concerned in publi&s;h|ing the declaration. They prote&s;ted their reluctance did not proceed from any &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition to his maje&s;ty's will; nor to a defect of tenderne&s;s for the nonconformi&s;ts; but &s;olely from the nature of the declaration it&s;elf, founded on a di&s;pen&s;ing power, which the parliament, on &s;everal occa&s;ions, had declared illegal. They &s;aid they could not be concerned in publi&s;hing it, with any regard to prudence, honour, and con&s;cience; and therefore they earne&s;tly and re&s;pectfully be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to excu&s;e them from obeying the order of council. On the eighteenth day of May, they went in a body to the palace, without having communicated their de&s;ign to any per&s;on whatever, and pre&s;ented this petition to the king, who received and read it with marks of &s;urprize and di&s;plea&s;ure. He &s;aid he did not look for &s;uch an addre&s;s from the Engli&s;h church, particularly from &s;ome among them: that they &s;hould hear from him, &s;hould he change his opinion; if not, he expected they would obey his order. They an&s;wered, that they were re&s;igned to the will of heaven; and retired.</P>

<P>He re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute tho&s;e prelates in the mo&s;t rigorous manner. The king's mea&s;ures were now become &s;o odious to the people, that although the bi&s;hops of Durham and Roche&s;ter, who were members of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, ordered the declaration to be read in the churches of their dioce&s;es, the audience would not &s;tay to hear them; and one mini&s;ter told his congregration, that though he had po&s;itive orders to read the declaration, they had none to hear it; a hint in con&s;equence of which they evacuated the church, and then he recited it in private. The petitioning bi&s;hops being brought be|fore the council, were a&s;ked if they owned the petition; and the archbi&s;hop acknowledged it was written by his own hand. Then the chancellor demanded if they would give bail to appear in the court of king's-bench, and an&s;wer the charge that &s;hould be brought again&s;t them, of endeavouring to dimini&s;h the king's authority, and interrupt the peace of the nation. They refu&s;ed to ap|pear in that court, alledging their privilege in quality of peers, which they were obliged to maintain, as well as the intere&s;t of the church, according to the oath they had taken to oppo&s;e all innovation in church and &s;tate. The chancellor threatened to commit them to the Tower, unle&s;s they would im|mediately retract their a&s;&s;ertions and withdraw the petition. They &s;aid they were ready to go where&s;oever the king &s;hould plea&s;e to &s;end them: they hoped the King of kings would be their protector and their judge: they were not afraid of man; and, as they had done nothing contrary to law, no menaces could &s;hake their re&s;olution. An order was immediately expedited for their commitment; and the attorney-general was commanded to pro&s;ecute them for having written and publ$&s;hed a &s;editious libel again&s;t his maje&s;ty's government. The king re&s;olved they &s;hould be conveyed to the Tower by water, as the whole city was in commotion. The people were no &s;ooner informed of their de&s;tination, than they ran to the &s;ide of the river, which was lined with an in|credible mult$tude. As the reverend pri&s;oners pa&s;&s;ed, the populace fell upon their knees, and great numbers ran into the water, craving their ble&s;&s;ing, calling upon heaven to protect them, and exhorting them to &s;uffer nobly for their religion. The deportment of the bi&s;hops was mode&s;t, humble, and re|&s;igned. They conjured the people to fear God, honour the king, and main|tain their loyalty. A va&s;t croud was a&s;&s;embled at the Tower, where they were received in the &s;ame manner. The very &s;oldiers by whom they were guarded, affected by the &s;pectacle, kneeled before them, imploring their bene|diction and forgivene&s;s. The prelates went immediately to the Tower-chapel, to thank heaven for tho&s;e afflictions, which, for the &s;ake of religion, they were thought worthy to endure.</P>

They even reached the camp at Houn&s;low, while the king was at dinner in lord Fever&s;ham's tent. This nobleman went out to learn the noi&s;e of tho&s;e &s;houts; and, when he returned, he told the king, it was nothing but the joy expre&s;&s;ed by the &s;oldiers at the acquittal of the bi&s;hops. "Call you that nothing! (&s;aid the king) but &s;o much the wor&s;e for them." He forthwith returned to Whitehall, and publi&s;hed a proclamation, forbidding the populace to a&s;&s;emble in the &s;treets: but, notwith&s;tanding this prohibition, the whole city was lighted up by bonfires and illuminations. The &s;ame rejoicings were made in all the principal towns of England, to the un&s;peakable mortification of James, who threatened to deliver up the bi&s;hops to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court; and, as a mark of his indignation, deprived Hal|loway and Powel of their offices.</P>

<P>This unhappy prince, perceiving the di&s;po&s;ition of his people was very unfavourable to his de&s;igns, determined to force them into a com|pliance with his will, provided he could depend upon the attachment of the army. He thought if one regiment would promi&s;e implicit obedience, their example would be followed by the re&s;t of the forces. In this hope, he ordered one of the regiments to be drawn up in his pre&s;ence; and the major, by his command, de&s;ired all tho&s;e that would not contribute to the repeal of the te&s;t and penal laws, to lay down their mu&s;quets. He was equally &s;urpri&s;ed and chagrined to &s;ee the whole battalion ground their arms, except two officers, and a very few &s;oldiers, who were Roman catholics. After &s;ome pau&s;e, he commanded them to take up their arms, telling them, that for the future he would not do them the honour to a&s;k their advice. His next &s;cheme was to di&s;|mi&s;s
<PB N="532" REF="5340">
the greater part of the prote&s;tant officers and &s;oldiers, and fill their places with catholics. He began by new-modelling the regiment commanded by his own $word$ &s;on the duke of Berwick. Five Iri&s;h &s;oldiers were enli&s;ted in every company. The national prejudice again&s;t the natives of that kingdom had been very keen fince the ma&s;&s;acre of the prote&s;tants; and now it was inflamed by the fears of popery, aggravated in ballads and pamphlets, which had a wonderful effect upon the common people. Beaumont the lieutenant-colonel of the regiment, and &s;everal captains, refu&s;ed to admit Iri&s;h recruits. They were immediately tried for mutiny by a council of war, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice. The navy was not more complying than the army. Admiral Strick|land having ordered ma&s;s to be celebrated on board of his &s;hip, &s;uch a tumul$ $$$ued among the &s;ailors, that he could hardly hinder them from throwing the priests into the &s;ea.</P>

<P>The king's ob&s;tinacy and per&s;everance &s;eemed to encrea&s;e in pro|portion to the people's oppo&s;ition. His queen and his prie&s;ts continually &s;ti|mulated him with intreaties and exhortations to proceed in the execution of his project; and he was encouraged by the &s;ervile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of &s;ome prote&s;tant divines. The bi&s;hops of Durham, Roche&s;ter, and Che&s;ter, &s;till approved of all his mea&s;ures. The clergy of Che&s;hire pre&s;ented an abject addre&s;s, con|demning the conduct of the &s;even prelates who had &s;crupled to publi&s;h the declaration. The bi&s;hop of Durham &s;u&s;pended thirty mini&s;ters of his dioce&s;e who refu&s;ed to read it; and the inhabitants of Carlile declared they would con|cur with his maje&s;ty in repealing the te&s;t and penal laws. James, far from altering his conduct, i&s;&s;ued orders for pro&s;ecuting all tho&s;e clergymen who had forbore to read his declaration. He &s;ent a mandate to his new fellows of Mag|daien-college at Oxford, to elect for their pre&s;ident one Gifford, a doctor of the Sorbonne, whom he likewi&s;e nominated to the &s;ee of Oxford, in the room of Parker, lately decea&s;ed. Sprat bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, and member of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court, &s;eeing the king proceeding with &s;uch a career in the road to r$in, re&s;olved to con&s;ult his own &s;afety in time, and withdrew him&s;elf from the commi&s;&s;ion, on pretence that his con&s;cience would not permit him to pro&s;ecute tho&s;e who had refu&s;ed to read the declaration.</P>

<P>Every individual, whether Whig or Tory, who knew the value of liberty, and was attached to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, now plainly &s;aw, that without an immediate and vigorous oppo&s;ition to the mea&s;ures of the king, the nation would be reduced to the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of &s;piritual and temporal &s;ub|jection. The principal per&s;ons of both parties began to reflect with remor&s;e upon the mutual animo&s;ity which had weakened the common intere&s;t: they perceived the nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to foreign aid; and they looked upon the prince of Orange as their natural ally and protector. As a previous &s;tep towards an application to this auxiliary, they &s;aw it would be nece&s;&s;ary to compromi&s;e all their dome&s;tic di&s;putes. Some moderate men of each faction exerted their endeavours for this purpo&s;e. Their efforts were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. The Whigs and Tories, united by the common ties of religion and liberty, agreed in private to lay a&s;ide all contention, and join heartily in oppo&s;ing the arbitrary de&s;igns of their mi&s;guided &s;overeign. The prince of Orange was no &s;tranger to the murmurs of the Engli&s;h. He had &s;ent over Dykvelt as an envoy, on pretence of remon&s;trating to James on his conduct.
<PB N="533" REF="5350">
But he had given him &s;ecret in&s;tructions to treat with the chiefs of the m$lcon$$nts. This agent executed his commi&s;&s;ion with equal &s;ecrecy and &s;ucce&s;s. He a&s;&s;ured the church party, of the prince's particular favour and regard. He exhorted the di&s;&s;enters to beware of the king's care&s;&s;es, which could not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;incere$ and hope for a toleration from a prote&s;tant parliament. They were &s;atisfied by the &s;olidity of his arguments, and profe&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t perfect attachment to the &s;tadtholder, in whom all their hopes were centered. The pro$$&s;tant prince's of the empire had formed a &s;eparate league at Magdeburg, for the de|fence of their religion; and &s;ome towns in Holland, which had been influenced by French councils, being alarmed and incen&s;ed at the per&s;ecution of the hu|g$$nots in France, dropped all their connections with the court of Lewis, and repo&s;ed an entire confidence in the &s;tadtholder. By this acce&s;&s;ion of influence, he was enabled to form a league at Aug&s;burg, in which all the princes of the empire united again&s;t the ambitious de&s;igns of the French monarch. Spain, Holland, and Savoy, acceded to this alliance.</P>

<P>While James &s;at upon the Engli&s;h throne, the prince &s;aw no pro&s;pect of engaging this kingdom in the general a&s;&s;ociation. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the prince&s;s was defeated by the birth of the prince of Wales; and therefore he would not &s;light an invitation that &s;o agreeably flattered his intere&s;t and ambition. Admiral Herbert, who was very popular among the &s;eamen, re&s;igned his commi&s;|&s;ion in di&s;gu&s;t, and retired to the Hague, where he a&s;&s;ured the prince of a ge|neral di&s;affection in the navy. This a&s;&s;urance was confirmed by admiral Ru&s;|&s;el, who, pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing frequently between England and Holland, &s;erved as a canal of communication between the prince and the Engli&s;h prote&s;tants. Henry Sidney, brother to Algernoon, went over to the Hague, under the pre|text of going to Spaa for his health, and had frequent conferences with the &s;tadt|holder. Lord Dunblaine, &s;on to the earl of Danby, made &s;everal voyages to Holland, in a frigate of his own, and conveyed not only a&s;&s;urances from a great number of noblemen and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, but likewi&s;e con&s;iderable &s;ums of money to the prince of Orange. Zuyle&s;tein, whom the prince had &s;ent over to England with compliments of congratulation on the birth of the prince of Wales, carried back a formal invitation from the Engli&s;h nobility. The bi&s;hop of London, the duke of Norfolk, the marquis of Hallifax, the earls of Dor&s;et, Devon&s;hire, Nottingham, and Danby, the lords Lovelace, Delamere, Paule$, Eland; many gentlemen of intere&s;t, and a great number of &s;ub&s;tan|tial citizens, joined in the application to the prince, intreating him to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the recovery of their liberties, and promi&s;ing to &s;upport his endeavours with their lives and fortunes. The earl of Shrew&s;bury, a very popular nobleman, who had renounced the Romi&s;h religion in which he was educated, and re&s;igned his regiment, mortgaged his e&s;tate for forty thou&s;and pounds, which he offered, together with his own per&s;onal &s;ervice, to the prince of Orange. Lord Whar|ton, though overwhelmed with age and infirmities, vi&s;ited the prince on the &s;ame errand. Lord Mordaunt re&s;ided at the Hague, and promoted the enter|prize with all his power. Even Sunderland, the favourite mini&s;ter of James, is &s;aid to have corre&s;ponded with the prince, and betrayed his infa$uated ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>So many concurring motives could not fail to influence the con|duct of the prince, who undertook the expedition, and began to make prepa|rations for it with equal prudence and di&s;patch. The competition between
<PB N="534" REF="5360">
prince Clement of Bavaria, and the cardinal of Fur&s;tenberg, for the archbi|&s;hopric of Cologne, furni&s;hed the &s;tates-general with a presence for a&s;&s;embling an army in the neighbourhood of Nimeguen. The prince managed his intrigues in &s;uch a manner, that three or four members devoted to his intere&s;t, were in|tru&s;ted with the direction of the affairs then in agitation. Orders were given to prepare a formidable fleet, and augment the army, as a war with France &s;eemed inevitable. The prince had an interview at Minden in We&s;tphalia, with the electors of Saxony and Brandenburg, the princes of Lunenburg, and the land|grave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el. To them he communicated his &s;cheme, which was of &s;uch con&s;equence to the general intere&s;t of religion and liberty; and they en|gaged to defend Holland from the attacks of France, during the prince's expe|dition to England. A fleet of fifty large &s;hips of war was equipped, with as many ve&s;&s;els as would &s;erve for the tran&s;portation of twelve thou&s;and land|forces. The&s;e were freighted on different pretences by the merchants of Am|&s;terdam, Rotterdam, and other maritime places: they were di&s;tributed among different ports, where the troops were ordered to embark, and the rendezvous was fixed in the road of Gore&eacute; where the navy waited for their junction. The prince's corre&s;pondents in England agreed to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves into different parts of the country, on the fir&s;t news of his landing$ in order to excite in&s;ur|rections again&s;t the government, and rai&s;e troops for his &s;ervice; and he never doubted of being immediately joined by &s;uch a number, as would enable him to make head again&s;t the king's army.</P>

<P>Notwith&s;tanding all his &s;ecre$y and di&s;cretion, the French and Engli&s;h mini&s;ters at the Hague took the alarm at tho&s;e preparations, and com|municated their &s;u&s;picions to James, who thought they had refined too much in their conjectures. He per&s;uaded him&s;elf that the intelligence his envoy pre|tended to have received, was no other than a rumour &s;pread by his enemies, to divert him from the pro&s;ecution of his de&s;igns. Neverthele&s;s, he thought pro|per to flatter his people with the promi&s;e of a new parliament, and gave orders to the chancellor to i&s;&s;ue writs for elections, on the fifth day of September: but, as the&s;e writs were not expedited, in all probability he had no other de&s;ign but that of amu&s;ing his &s;ubjects. At this period, Bonrepos arrived as amba&s;&s;a|dor from France, with offers from Lewis, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the king with a fleet and ar|my of thirty thou&s;and men, again&s;t all invaders: but this was declined, by the advice of Sunderland. He repre&s;ented to James, that by introducing French forces into the kingdom, on the eve of a new parliament, he would entirely lo&s;e the hearts of all his &s;ubjects; and run the ri&s;k of &s;eeing his kingdom con|quered by his auxiliaries. It was &s;uppo&s;ed, however, that by means of this mini&s;ter, a new alliance was concluded between the kings of France and En|gland. Mean while, James ordered his amba&s;&s;ador in Holland to pre&s;ent a memorial to the &s;tates, de&s;iring to know the de&s;tination of their extraordinary armament. He received an an&s;wer, importing, that they only imitated the example of the king of England, who had lately equipped a powerful fleet, and a&s;&s;embled a numerous army, without explaining his intentions; and they, in their turn, de&s;ired to know the nature of the alliance which he had concluded with the French monarch. This an&s;wer in &s;ome mea&s;ure waked the &s;u&s;picion of James, who ordered the towns of Port&s;mouth and Hull, the two keys of En|gland, to be put in a po&s;ture of defence, and be&s;towed the governments of the&s;e
<PB N="535" REF="5370">
places upon two Roman catholics: but he took no further precautions again&s;t the impending danger, and could not believe the prince of Orange would hazard a de&s;cent.</P>

<P>The court of France, at the reque&s;t of Skelton the Engli&s;h mi|ni&s;ter, who acted on this occa&s;ion without orders, &s;ent directions to the count D'Avaux, their envoy at the Hague, to declare, in a memorial to the &s;tates, that the intimate friend&s;hip and alliance &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the kings of France and England would oblige his ma&s;ter, not only to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Engli&s;h monarch, &s;hould he be attacked, but al&s;o to look upon the fir&s;t act of ho&s;tility again&s;t England, as a manife&s;t violation of the peace, and a formal de&s;ign to break with France. The &s;tates returned an ambiguous an&s;wer, and demanded of the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, an explanation of the la&s;t alliance between France and England. They made the &s;ame demand of the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, by the mouth of Van Citters their envoy at London. James, with the concurrence of his council, di&s;owned the memorial of D'Avaux; and Skelton being immediately recalled from France, was committed to the Tower for his pre&s;umption. Sun|derland &s;till argued, that the belief of &s;uch a connection with Lewis, would ruin the king in the opinion of his &s;ubjects. This advice &s;ome writers impute to treachery. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of September, the king i&s;&s;ued a procla|mation, declaring his de&s;ign was to procure an entire liberty of con&s;cience to all his &s;ubjects; to maintain the Engli&s;h church, by confirming the acts of unifor|mity, without any other alteration than that of repealing the penal laws enacted again&s;t tho&s;e who were not promoted to eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices. He likewi&s;e expre&s;&s;ed his readine&s;s to con&s;ent to a law that &s;hould exclude Roman catholics from &s;eats in the hou&s;e of commons. This proclamation, which was not only ambiguous, but al&s;o &s;elf-contradictory, made no favourable impre&s;&s;ion upon the people, who expected redre&s;s of their grievances from the prince of Orange alone. The king of France had by this time &s;ent a numerous army into the empire, under the command of the dauphin, and Philip&s;burg was inve&s;ted. Barillon, the French envoy at London, advi&s;ed the king of England to de&s;ire his ma&s;ter to abandon the &s;iege, and &s;end his forces to the frontiers of Holland; a motion that in all likelihood would prevent the expedition again&s;t England; but this advice was not taken. Sunderland &s;till objected the jealou&s;y of the &s;ubjects, as the friends of the prince of Orange had circulated a report, that the Dutch armament was de&s;tined to prevent the French from landing in England.</P>

<P>James being now convinced of the prince's de&s;ign, ordered the navy to be manned and prepared for &s;ea; &s;et on foot new levies, and &s;ent for &s;ome regiments from Ireland; appointed the earl of Fever&s;ham general of his land-forces, and conferred the command of the navy upon the earl of Dart|mouth. He directed the marquis of Albeville his mini&s;ter at the Hague, to a&s;&s;ure the &s;tates, that there was no private treaty &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and the French monarch; and to declare his readine&s;s to concur with them in taking mea&s;ures for maintaining the peace of Nimeguen. They paid no regard to this memorial. On the contrary, the pen&s;ionary frankly owned to the marquis, that the prince of Orange, in con&s;equence of an invitation from the Engli&s;h nobility, was re&s;olved to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the ancient con&s;titution, which the king had entirely altered &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion. When the mini&s;ter com|municated this information to the king, adding, that the Hague was filled
<PB N="536" REF="5380">
with Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, waiting to embark in the prince's expedition, he and his whole council were overwhelmed with con&s;ternation: they no longer doubted that the invader would be &s;upported by the majority of the kingdom; and being incapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing between their friends and enemies, they knew not whom to tru&s;t. In this emergency, James a&s;&s;embled the bi&s;hops of Winche&s;ter, Chiche&s;ter, Roche&s;ter, Peterborough, Ely, Bath and Wells, and de&s;ired their ad|vice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They obtained leave to go and con&s;ult with the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who was indi&s;po&s;ed; and promi&s;ed to deliver their &s;entiments in writing. Mean while the king publi&s;hed a proclamation, informing the &s;ubjects of a purpo&s;ed inva&s;ion; exhorting them to lay a&s;ide their animo&s;ities, and join with him again&s;t the common enemy, who&s;e intention was to en&s;lave them: a&s;&s;uring them he would venture his life once more in their defence; and giving them to under&s;tand, that he could not conveniently a&s;&s;emble the new parliament, until this &s;torm &s;hould be overblown. In order to conciliate the affection of his people, he ordered the bi&s;hop of London to be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in his epi&s;copal functions: he appointed a new mayor for the city of London, becau&s;e Eyles the anabapti&s;t was not agreeable to the citizens, who were members of the Engli&s;h church. He a&s;&s;ured the magi&s;trates that he would re&s;tore their antient charter; and he publi&s;hed a general amne&s;ty, with &s;ome exceptions.</P>

<P>On the third day of October, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, ac|companied by eight prelates whom James had con&s;ulted, was admitted to an audience at Whitehall, and pre&s;ented the king with the re&s;ult of their delibe|ration, in ten articles of advice. They coun&s;elled his maje&s;ty to put the go|vernment of the different counties into the hands of per&s;ons di&s;tingui&s;hed by their birth, and qualified by the laws of the land: To aboli&s;h the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court: To recal all the di&s;pen&s;ations, by virtue of which di&s;qualified per&s;ons had been admitted into civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical employments: To revoke all the licences by which catholics were permitted to open public &s;chools: To de&s;i&s;t from all preten&s;ion to a di&s;pen&s;ing power, or refer it entirely to the deci&s;ion of parliament: To forbid the four apo&s;tolic vicars to continue invading the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, which belonged to the bi&s;hops of the Engli&s;h church: To fill up the vacant bi&s;hoprics and benefices with men of learning and piety: To re&s;tore the charters which had been taken from corporations: To a&s;&s;emble a free parliament; and allow the bi&s;hops to offer &s;uch rea&s;ons as might induce him to be reconciled to the Engli&s;h church, in which he had been born and educated. Though the&s;e advices mu&s;t have been very unpalatable to the king, as contain|ing &s;evere reproaches upon his pa&s;t government, he affected to take them in good part, and even complied with them in &s;everal articles. He &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court: re&s;tored the old charter to the city of London. The lieutenants of the counties were enjoined to correct all abu&s;es which had injured the corporations. The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, as vi&s;itor of Magdalen-college at Oxford, was authorized to re-e&s;tabli&s;h it in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all its rights and privileges. All corporations were re&s;tored to the enjoymentof their antient immunities. Several governors were changed: catholic ju&s;tices and ma|gi&s;trates were deprived of their offices, which the king now be&s;towed upon prote&s;tants; &s;o that in a few days the great work, in which the king had laboured &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, was entirely undone. The&s;e ha&s;ty &s;teps towards a reformation, though &s;uppo&s;ed to be the effect of fear, began to make &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ion

upon the minds of the people, when he received intelligence that the Dutch fleet was di&s;per&s;ed and di&s;abled by a tempe&s;t. He forthwith recalled the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter from Oxford, after that prelate had &s;ummoned the fellows of Magdalen-college; and &s;eemed inclined to retract all the &s;teps he had taken for the &s;atisfaction of his &s;ubjects: yet, hearing the news he had received were fal&s;e, he commanded the bi&s;hop to proceed, and the fellows of the col|lege were re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; but, by his conduct in this affair, he brought his &s;in|cerity in que&s;tion.</P>

<P>As he dreaded the violence of the populace, he ordered all the Ro|mi&s;h chapels in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter to be &s;hut up; and the prie&s;ts of that communion, fore&s;eeing the approaching &s;torm, began to di&s;appear. A body of troops from Ireland landed at Che&s;ter, and three thou&s;and men from Scot|land arrived at Carli&s;le. Orders were i&s;&s;ued to rai&s;e ten new regiments, and arm the militia; and a proclamation was publi&s;hed, commanding the &s;ubjects to remove their cattle to the di&s;tance of twenty miles from the place where the de&s;cent &s;hould be made. A writing being publi&s;hed in Holland, in&s;inu|ating that the birth of the prince of Wales was an impo&s;ture; the king a&s;&s;emb|led a council extraordinary, to which he invited the queen dowager, with all the lords &s;piritual and temporal then in London, the lord mayor and aldermen, and the judges. He told them his enemies had pretended to doubt the birth of the prince of Wales; and therefore he had taken this opportunity to examine the affair in their pre&s;ence, that he might clear him&s;elf from all &s;u&s;picion of having practi&s;ed &s;uch a vile impo&s;tnre. Forty witne&s;&s;es were produced; and, as far as the nature of the ca&s;e would permit, a&s;certained the queen's delivery, to the &s;atisfaction of every unprejudiced hearer; but great part of the nation were incapable of conviction; and this proof &s;erved only to rivet their &s;u&s;picion, or confirm their notions of the impo&s;ture. The depo&s;itions were recorded in chancery, printed, publi&s;hed, and di&s;per&s;ed through the kingdom. Many people concluded that there mu&s;t have been &s;omething very weak and defective in a cau&s;e that required &s;uch extraordinary &s;upport, not con&s;idering that their own prejudices had obliged the king to have recour&s;e to &s;uch an ex|traordinary inve&s;tigation. In October the earl of Sunderland was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his two employments of &s;ecretary of &s;tate and pre&s;ident of the council. He was di&s;agreeable to the king's catholic coun&s;ellors; and &s;u&s;pected, nay even openly accu&s;ed, of corre&s;ponding with the enemy: in the &s;equel he publi&s;hed an apology for his conduct.</P>

<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the prince of Orange was employed in drawing up a manife&s;to, explaining the motives by which he was actuated, and the purport of his expedition. He enumerated the grievances of the Engli&s;h nation: recapitulated the fruitle&s;s attempts which had been made for procuring redre&s;s in the u&s;ual way of petition and remon&s;trance: mentioned the circum&s;tance of the &s;uppo&s;ed impo&s;ture in the birth of the prince of Wales: profe&s;&s;ed his own regard and that of the prince&s;s for the Engli&s;h nation, to the relief of which he had been invited by a great number of lords &s;piritual and temporal, gentlemen, and other per&s;ons of all conditions. He avowed his in|tention of vi&s;iting England with a body of &s;orces &s;ufficient to &s;ecure him from the attempts of tho&s;e who might endeavour to thwart his mea&s;ures. He de|clared his de&s;ign was to convoke a free parliament, to which he would refer the

&s;ettlement of the nation; and the &s;ame promi&s;e he made with re&s;pect to Scot|land and Ireland. This declaration was already printed, in order to be di&s;tri|buted among the Engli&s;h people, when he received information that the king had redre&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the grievances of which he complained, and taxed hi$ with a de&s;ign to conquer England. He therefore made an addition to his manife&s;to, importing, that the forces he intended to tran&s;port, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ufficient for the conque&s;t of England; nor could the Engli&s;h noble|men and gentlemen, engaged in his undertaking, be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of con|tributing to the &s;ubjection of their country: that the late redre&s;s of &s;ome grie|vances, though a plain acknowledgment of oppre&s;&s;ion, was but a temporary expedient to cajole the people, who could have no &s;ecurity for their rights and privileges, but in the acts of a free parliament, which he promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble in their behalf. The &s;tates-general, at the &s;ame time, publi&s;hed the rea&s;ons which had induced them to lend their &s;hips and forces to the prince of Orange; namely, the invitation which the prince had received from the nobility and clergy of England, and the apprehen&s;ion that king James, after he &s;hould have made him&s;elf ab&s;olute in his own kingdom, would join the French mo|narch in de&s;troying the prote&s;tant religion, and exterminating the people of the United Provinces.</P>

<P>The prince of Orange, having taken leave of the &s;tates, embarked on the nineteenth day of October with the earls of Shrew&s;bury and Maccles|field, the lords Mordaunt, Wilt&s;hire, Paulet, Ela$, and Dunblaine; admiral Herbert, Mr. Sidney, Mr. Ruffel, Doctor Burnet, and many other Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. He was al&s;o attended by the count de Schomberg and his &s;on, with about three hundred French officers of the reformed religion. His fleet con|&s;i&s;ted of fifty &s;ail of the line, twenty frigates, as many fire&s;hips, and about four hundred tran&s;ports, on board of which twelve or thirteen thou&s;and &s;oldiers were embarked. Admiral Herbert led the van; the rear was conducted by Evert|zen, and the prince commanded in the centre, with a flag di&s;playing his own arms, circum&s;cribed, "The prote&s;tant religion, and the liberties of England." Underneath, "Je maintiendrai," the device that di&s;tingui&s;hed the hou&s;e of Na&s;&s;au. The fleet had &s;ailed but a few leagues when the wind &s;uddenly &s;hifted to the we&s;t, and blew a violent &s;torm, which la&s;ted two whole days, and &s;cat|tered the &s;hips in &s;uch a manner, that a whole week elap&s;ed before they could re-a&s;&s;emble at their rendezvous. They had &s;u&s;tained very little damage: the &s;tates, however, magnified their lo&s;s in the gazettes, and declared that the prince would be obliged to po&s;tpone his expedition to the &s;pring.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="43" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>This artful in&s;inuation had the de&s;ired effect: James believed their fleet was actually di&s;abled; and, on that &s;uppo&s;ition, recalled &s;ome of the con|ce&s;&s;ions he had made for the &s;atisfaction of his people. When he under&s;tood that the prince, in his manife&s;to, declared he was invited by a great number of lords &s;piritual and temporal, he &s;ummoned the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and three or four other prelates into his pre&s;ence, and in&s;i&s;ted upon their &s;ign|ing a declaration to di&s;prove the prince's a&s;&s;ertion. They a&s;&s;ured him of their fidelity in general terms, but de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from an&s;wering a writing which did not concern them in particular. The king was incen&s;ed at their re|fu&s;al, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with marks of the mo&s;t violent indignation. Then he publi&s;hed an an&s;wer to the prince's manife&s;to, in which he endeavoured to
<PB N="539" REF="5410">
ju&s;tify his own conduct, and blacken the character of the &s;tadtholder. At this period two printed letters were di&s;tributed through England; one addre&s;&s;ed to the Engli&s;h army by the prince of Orange, and the other directed by admiral Herbert to the &s;ailors, by whom he was greatly beloved. The&s;e papers con|tained rea&s;ons and exhortations, di&s;&s;uading them from acting as the in&s;truments of tyranny again&s;t the religion and liberties of their country; and they produced a &s;urpri&s;ing effect.</P>

<P>The damage &s;u&s;tained by the Dutch fleet, being in a few days re|paired, the prince re-embarked on the fir&s;t day of November, and at fir&s;t &s;teered to the northward, intending to land in the mouth of the Humber; but the ea&s;terly wind blew &s;o &s;trong in the night, that he changed his re&s;olution, and &s;tood to the we&s;tward. He &s;ailed down the channel without &s;eeing the king's fleet, which lay at the Gunfleet to the number of &s;ixty &s;hips, commanded by the earl of Dartmouth. The prince now determined to land at Torbay; but, in the night of the fourth, the pilot over&s;hot the Start-point, and the gale was &s;o fre&s;h that it was found impracticable to beat up to windward. This accident would have obliged the prince to bear away for Falmouth, at the extremity of the i&s;land, had not the wind unexpectedly &s;hifted to the we&s;t, and conducted them into Torbay; while at the &s;ame time it effectually hindered the Engli&s;h fleet to come down the channel. On the fifth day of November, the anniver|&s;ary of the gunpowder plot, the prince di&s;embarked his troops at the village of Broxholme in Torbay. The baggage and artillery were &s;ent to Top&s;ham, the &s;eaport of Exeter, and next day the prince began his march for that city, where however he remained ten days, without being joined by any per&s;on of con|&s;ideration. The king no &s;ooner received intelligence of his landing, than he ordered his troops to a&s;&s;emble on Sali&s;bury plain. In order to vilify the prince's power, he di&s;tributed li&s;ts of all the regiments that compo&s;ed his little army. Hearing the city of London, with the counties of Kent and York, intended to pre&s;ent addre&s;&s;es, be&s;eeching him to effect an accommo|dation with the prince of Orange, he publicly declared, that he would con&s;ider as enemies all tho&s;e who &s;hould propo&s;e &s;uch an accommodation. At the &s;ame time he publi&s;hed a declaration, charging the prince of Orange with a de&s;ign to u&s;urp the crown of England. Mean while the &s;tadtholder pa&s;&s;ed his time very di&s;agreeably at Exeter: the bi&s;hop had quitted the place at his landing, and repaired to London, where the king created him archbi&s;hop of York. When Doctor Burnet mounted the pulpit at Exeter, on the Sunday after the prince's arrival, in order to read the manife&s;to, all the canons and great part of the con|gregation left the church. Very few Engli&s;hmen offered their &s;ervices to the &s;tadtholder; and he met with very little &s;ucce&s;s in rai&s;ing three new regiments of infantry. Though the people were generally well affected to his de&s;ign; the recent rememberance of the cruelties exerci&s;ed upon the parti&s;ans of Monmouth, in that country, deterred them from engaging in any other enterprize again&s;t the government.</P>

<P>On the tenth day after the prince's landing, when he began to de|liberate about reimbarking, he was joined by &s;ome per&s;ons of con&s;equence; among the&s;e was Edward Seymour, who propo&s;ed an a&s;&s;ociation for the defence of the laws and liberties of the kingdom, binding the &s;ub&s;cribers to &s;tand by the prince of Orange, and by one another, until, by means of a free parliament,

their religion and privileges &s;hould be &s;ecured in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;creen them from any future danger of popery and &s;lavery. This a&s;&s;ociation was &s;ub|&s;cribed by all pre&s;ent; and from this day, the prince's affairs a&s;&s;umed a more promi&s;ing a&s;pect. He began his march for Sali&s;bury, and the number of his followers daily increa&s;ed. Lord Colche&s;ter, &s;on to the earl of Rivers, Mr. Wharton, colonel Godfrey, and Mr. How, joined him with about &s;ixty hor&s;e|men well-mounted; the&s;e were followed by the earl of Abington, captain Clarges, and &s;ome others. Lord Cornbury, &s;on of the earl of Clarendon, colonel of a regiment of dragoons, revolted to the prince with a good part of four regiments. Lord Delamere a&s;&s;embled his va&s;&s;als in Che&s;hire, and openly declared for the &s;tadtholder. Lord Lovelace began his march for Exeter, at the head of four&s;core hor&s;e; but he was encountered by the militia at Ciren|ce&s;ter, defeated, and taken pri&s;oner. The two archbi&s;hops, five other prelates, the dukes of Grafton and Ormond, the earls of Dor&s;et, Clare, Clarendon, Bur|lington, Angle&s;ey, and Roche&s;ter; the lords Newport, Paget, Chandois, and Offul&s;ton, meeting in London, drew up and pre&s;ented a petition to the king, be&s;eeching him to convoke a free parliament, and take mea&s;ures for &s;atisfying the prince of Orange. James declared, that he pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to a&s;&s;emble a free parliament; and promi&s;ed, upon his royal word, that it &s;hould meet im|mediately after the prince's departure from the kingdom: but he &s;aid, this &s;tep could not be taken while the enemy was in the country, and had it in his power to influence the elections.</P>

<P>This unhappy monarch was now involved in a labyrinth of fears and perplexity. The defection of his &s;ubjects made a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind. He had rea&s;on to believe the army was infected with the &s;ame &s;pirit; and he began to di&s;tru&s;t the fidelity of tho&s;e who nece&s;&s;arily enjoyed a great &s;hare of his confidence. Re&s;olving to head his army in per&s;on, he recom|mended the city of London to the care of the lord mayor. He made a &s;peech to his principal officers, in which he &s;olemnly renewed the promi&s;e of a&s;&s;embling a free parliament. He told them, if they de&s;ired any thing more, he was ready to gratify their wi&s;hes: he declared, that if any of them were &s;till di&s;&s;atisfied with his conduct, and inclined to join the prince of Orange, he would &s;upply them with pa&s;&s;ports, in order to &s;pare them the &s;hame of de&s;erting their lawful &s;overeign. He left a council at London, compo&s;ed of the chancellor Jeffries, the lords Godolphin, Powis, Bella&s;is, and Pre&s;ton; and &s;et out for Sali&s;bury, where he arrived on the nineteenth day of November. There he was compli|mented by the officers, who expre&s;&s;ed their attachment to him in the warme&s;t terms, and their indignation at the de&s;ertion of lord Cornbury. Notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, he was expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t unea&s;y reflections. He &s;aw all his &s;chemes bla&s;ted, his people melting from him, his friends falling off, and his family in danger of immediate ruin. His interned di&s;turbance had &s;uch an effect upon his con&s;titution, that the blood gu&s;hed from his no&s;trils; and next day the &s;ame &s;ymptom recurred.</P>

<P>The officers forgetting their late profe&s;&s;ions, now de&s;ired the earl of Fever&s;ham to tell the king, that they could not in con&s;cience &s;erve again&s;t the prince of Orange, who aimed at nothing but the &s;ecurity of the prote&s;tant religion, and the liberties of the people. This was a mortifying declaration to the king, who thus found him&s;elf deprived in a manner of all re&s;ource. Fe|ver&s;ham
<PB N="541" REF="5430">
advi&s;ed him to &s;ecure lord Churchill, who&s;e fidelity was que&s;tioned. James had heaped &s;uch favours upon this nobleman, whom he had rai&s;ed from ob&s;eurity, ennobled, and promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general, that he could not doubt his attachment. Next day, however, Churchill went over to the prince, accompanied by the duke of Grafton, colonel Berkeley, and &s;everal other officers. He &s;ent a letter to the king, pleading con&s;cience for his de&s;er|tion; but, James imputed it to the fear of his falling fortune, operating upon a mind that felt no ties of gratitude. He was now wholly abandoned by his for|titude, and returned to London in a &s;tate of dejection, after having publi&s;hed a proclamation, promi&s;ing a free pardon to all de&s;erters who in four and twenty hours &s;hould return to their duty. This produced no effect; but, he had the additional mortification to &s;ee him&s;elf for&s;aken by his &s;on-in-law prince George of Denmark, who left him at Andover.</P>

<P>The prince of Orange who had advanced to Sherburne, receiving advice that the king had returned to London, and his army retired to Read|ing, marched towards Sali&s;bury, which he entered amid&s;t the acclamations of the people. In his route to this place, a &s;kirmi&s;h happened between two parties of the oppo&s;ite armies, in which the Engli&s;h gained &s;ome advantage. The earl of Bath governor of Plymouth, admitted the Dutch fleet into that harbour. The earl of Shrew&s;bury and Sir John Gui&s;e expelled the duke of Beaufort from Bri&s;tol, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the inhabitants, who declared for the prince of Orange. The earl of Devon&s;hire having a&s;&s;embled a great number of gentlemen in Derby&s;hire, openly e&s;pou&s;ed the &s;ame cau&s;e. The earl of Danby &s;ecured the city and county of York in the &s;ame intere&s;t. Their ex|ample was followed by Nottingham&s;hire and the town of Berwick. Hull was delivered into the hands of colonel Copley by the garri&s;on, after they had arre&s;ted the lord Langdale their catholic governor. The prince received tenders of &s;ervice from the duke of Somer&s;et and the earl of Oxford. The duke of Ormond entered the city of Oxford, and ordered the manife&s;to to be read in public. Finally, the king was abandoned by his own daughter Anne prince&s;s of Denmark, who e&s;caped privately from Whitehall, and was accompanied by the bi&s;hop of London to Nottingham; from whence &s;he repaired to Oxford, where &s;he was joined by her hu&s;band. She &s;ent a letter to the queen, containing an apology for her retreat, and the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of duty to her father. When James was made acquainted with the flight of his favourite daughter, he could not help bur&s;ting into tears, and exclaimed, in an agony of grief, "God help me! my own children have for&s;aken me!" He now tottered on the brink of de&s;truction. The queen was overwhelmed with con&s;ternation. Peters his confe&s;&s;or had retired to France, in the retinue of the earl of Walde|grave, who &s;ucceeded Skelton as amba&s;&s;ador at Paris; Jeffries was di&s;mayed; and Barillon the French envoy, reproached the king with his having rejected the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lewis.</P>

<P>Finding him&s;elf in this de&s;olate condition, he a&s;&s;embled the few prote&s;tant lords &s;piritual and temporal who happened to be at London, and im|plored their advice. They were unanimou&s;ly of opinion that he &s;hould imme|diately call a free parliament; grant an ab&s;olute pardon to all tho&s;e who had joined the prince of Orange; &s;end deputies to treat with him of an accommo|dation; and in&s;tantly deprive all catholics of the employments they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.
<PB N="542" REF="5440">
He forthwith ordered the chancellor to prepare writs for the elections. He publi&s;hed a proclamation, declaring, That all peers and commons &s;hould be at liberty to vote or be elected without di&s;tinction, whether they had or had not joined the prince of Orange. Hales a catholic, was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the lieute|nancy of the Tower, and that command conferred on colonel Skelton. The marquis of Hal$$$ax, the earl of Nottingham, and lord Godolphin, were nomi|nated as deputies to treat with the prince of Orange, who furni&s;hed them with a &s;afe-conduct; and they &s;et out on this emba&s;&s;y in the beginning of Decem|ber. About this time, a paper was circulated thro' all England, entituled, "The third declaration of the prince of Orange." He di&s;owned the paper, tho' it was publi&s;hed in his name. The author declared his highne&s;s did not intend to mole&s;t the papi&s;ts, if they would be quiet; but, that all of that communion found in arms, or in the exerci&s;e of public employments, with their abettors, &s;hould be treated as enemies and perturbators of the public peace. All magi&s;trates and officers, civil as well as military, were required to &s;eize, di&s;arm, and &s;ecure &s;uch di&s;turb|ers, on pain of being deemed traitors to the religion, laws, and liberties of their country. This declaration, which was publi&s;hed by almo&s;t all the ju&s;tices of the peace in the kingdom, completed the de&s;pair of the catholics: &s;o that they dur&s;t not &s;hew their faces in public. The hue and cry was rai&s;ed again&s;t fa|ther Peters; and the earl of Sali&s;bury was pre&s;ented as a popi&s;h recu&s;ant, to the grand jury of Middle&s;ex.</P>

<P>The king's deputies had an audience of the prince at Hungerford; and at his de&s;ire delivered their ma&s;ter's propo&s;als in writing. James de&s;ired, that their difference might be left to the deci&s;ion of a free parliament which he had convoked; and that the two armies &s;hould remain at an equal di&s;tance from London. The prince on the other hand propo&s;ed, That all papi&s;ts &s;hould be di&s;armed and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the employments they enjoyed: That all pro|clamations again&s;t him&s;elf &s;hould be recalled: That the command of the Tower &s;hould be put into the hands of the lord mayor: That, if the king &s;hould think proper to re&s;ide in London during the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, the prince &s;hould likewi&s;e remain in the &s;ame place, with an equal number of guards: or, That the king and he &s;hould r$&s;ide at an equal di&s;tance from London: That the two armies &s;hould be removed thirty miles from the city: and, That no new forces &s;hould be brought into the kingdom: That Tilbury$fort &s;hould be put into the hands of the city-magi&s;trates: That, until the parliament &s;hould meet, part of the revenue &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned for the maintenance of the prince's army: and, That in order to prevent an inva&s;ion from abroad, the fortre&s;s of Port&s;mouth &s;hould be committed to the charge of &s;ome per&s;on equally agree|able to the king and the prince. When James peru&s;ed the&s;e propo&s;als, he &s;aid, they were more moderate than he expected. He a&s;&s;embled the noblemen who were in London, to deliberate upon the pre&s;ent conjuncture of affairs. Ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the earl of Bedford, <Q>&startq;My lord, (&s;aid he,) you are an hone&s;t man; have great credit; and can do me &s;ignal &s;ervice.&endq;</Q> <Q>&startq;Sir, (replied the earl,) I am a feeble, old man, very unable to do you any con&s;iderable &s;ervice; but, I had a &s;on (he added with a &s;igh) who, if now alive, could &s;erve your maje&s;ty in a more effectual manner.&endq;</Q> He alluded to lord Ru&s;&s;el, who had &s;uf|fered death in the la&s;t reign. James was &s;o &s;truck with this reflection, that he could not an&s;wer one word.</P>

<P>Every thing now tended to an accommodation; and the nobility were ordered to rea&s;&s;emble next day, to agree upon mea&s;ures for re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the peace of the kingdom. But, the king altered his re&s;olution before morning. His private coun&s;ellors advi&s;ed him to retire into France, where he would be protected by a powerful and generous monarch, who would enable him to re&s;ume the reins of government upon his own terms. Whereas, by remaining in England, he would be reduced to the &s;hadow of royalty, and &s;ee him&s;elf com|pelled to retract all his conce&s;lions in favour of the catholic religion. They infu&s;ed terrors into the queen, by repre&s;enting, that the parliament would declare her delivery an impo&s;ture, the prince of Wales illegitimate; and perhaps ac|cu&s;e her of trea&s;on for having favoured catholics, contrary to the laws of the realm. Thus alarmed, &s;he re&s;olved to retire immediately into France with the prince of Wales; and extorted a po&s;itive promi&s;e from the king, that he would follow her without delay. On the tenth of December at night, &s;he cro&s;&s;ed the river with her infant in an open boat, expo&s;ed to the wind and rain; and waited in the fields at Lambeth, until Lauzun provided a coach for her accommodation. In this &s;he travelled to Grave&s;end, where &s;he embarked on board of a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el that conveyed her and the prince of Wales in &s;afety to Calais. From thence &s;he ha&s;tened to Ver&s;ailles, where Lewis received her with the mo&s;t cordial ho&s;pitality.</P>

<P>The king having &s;ent an order to the earl of Fever&s;ham to di&s;band the army, and cau&s;ed the writs for the election of a new parliament to be burned, di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in plain apparel, and about four o'clock in the morning, em|barked in a boat at Whitehall, accompanied by Sir Edward Hales, Mr. Shel|don, and Abbadie his valet de chambre. He threw the great-&s;eal into the Thames, that it might not fall into the hands of his enemies, and proceeded to|wards the mouth of the river, where a &s;hip waited for his reception. He hoped his ab&s;ence would produce a perplexity in the nation, which might be favoura|ble to his cau&s;e: but the prince of Orange fore&s;aw, that nothing would &s;ooner promote the accompli&s;hment of his own de&s;ign. The king's di&s;appearance was actually productive of con&s;ternation and confu&s;ion, as all government &s;eemed to be &s;u&s;pended. The lords and bi&s;hops who were in London, together with &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, held a con&s;ultation in Guildhall with the lord mayor and aldermen. They re&s;olved to adhere to the prince of Orange; and &s;ent deputies to him with this re&s;olution, &s;ub&s;cribed by all the members of that a&s;|&s;embly. They appointed lord Lucas lieutenant of the Tower, until the prince's plea&s;ure &s;hould be known. The common-council of London &s;ent a deputa|tion to the prince with an addre&s;s, craving his protection, and intreating him to honour the city with his pre&s;ence. The populace plundered, burned, and demoli&s;hed all the Romi&s;h chapels. Jeffries the chancellor being detected in the dre&s;s of a &s;ailor, was maltreated by the multitude, and conveyed to the Tower, where death &s;oon delivered him from the terrors of exemplary pu|ni&s;hment.</P>

This incident was &s;welled up into a report, that an Iri&s;h army had landed in England, and was in full march to the capital, burning, plun|dering, and ma&s;&s;acring, without mercy or di&s;tinction. The rumour was in the

circulation improved into a detail of the mo&s;t dreadful circum&s;tances. The city of London was alarmed with the account of their having reached Ux|bridge. Some endeavoured to &s;ave them&s;elves by flight; others ran to arms; all the windows were illuminated, that the enemy might not take advantage of the darkne&s;s; univer&s;al tumult and trepidation en&s;ued. The panic extended it&s;elf to all parts of England with amazing rapidity; and, in the more remote counties, had re&s;olved to put all the Roman catholics to the &s;word, when they were hap|pily undeceived by learning the true cau&s;e of this commotion. The prince of Orange was no &s;ooner informed of the army's being di&s;banded, than he publi&s;hed a proclamation, requiring the officers to rea&s;&s;emble their men, and wait in quarters for further orders; and another proclamation, to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e, was i&s;&s;ued by the noblemen a&s;&s;embled at London.</P>

<P>In the mean time, the &s;mall ve&s;&s;el in which the king had embarked, was detained at Fever&s;ham by the common people, who di&s;covered Sir Edward Hales on board, and mi&s;took the king for his prie&s;t or chaplain. In this opi|nion they arre&s;ted, in&s;ulted, and robbed their unfortunate &s;overeign of &s;ome valuable jewels, and about five hundred guineas. At length, he was known by a con&s;table, who fell at his feet, begging pardon for the in&s;olence of the people; and they now, with marks of contrition, offered to re&s;tore the plunder. He received the jewels, but de&s;ired them to keep the money. Then he &s;ent for the $arl of Winchel&s;ea, who happened to be in the neighbourhood; and that nobleman per&s;uaded him to return to London. The news of his being di&s;covered in &s;uch a manner, had very different effects upon different per&s;ons. The nobility and magi&s;trates of the city began to fear they had been too officious; for, they perceived the hearts of the people relenting at the di&s;tre&s;s of their &s;overeign. Having con&s;ulted together, they deputed four of their number to wait upon his maje&s;ty, and intreat him to return to Whitehall, where he &s;hould be received with the mo&s;t dutiful re&s;pect. His coaches were immediately di&s;patched to Fever&s;ham. Then they &s;ent an expre&s;s, to inform the prince of Orange that his maje&s;ty was &s;till in the kingdom. The prince had now advanced to Wind&s;or, where he received this intelligence with equal concern and &s;urprize. He forthwith di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Zuyle&s;tein with a me&s;&s;age to the king, de&s;iring he would retire to Roche&s;ter, until mea&s;ures could be taken with regard to his affairs. But before this me&s;&s;age could be delivered, the king arrived in London, where he was received amid&s;t the acclamations of the people, who rejoiced at his re|turn, as if he had come from immediate conque&s;t, and triumphed over the enemies of the nation. He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Whitehall, and his dome&s;tics $$ocked around him; but, this gleam of good fortune was of a very &s;hort duration.</P>

<P>He had &s;ent the earl of Fever&s;ham with a letter to the prince of Orange, inviting him to St. James's with &s;uch a number of guards as he &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary, that they might confer together upon means for appea&s;ing the troubles of the nation. The prince would not deign to an&s;wer this letter; but ordered the earl to be di&s;armed and arre&s;ted. He &s;igned a written order to the marquis of Hallifax, the earl of Shrew&s;bury, and lord Delamere, to go and give the king notice that it would be proper for him to retire to Ham-hou&s;e near Richmond; and that he might retain his own guards for the &s;$$ety of his per&s;on. Then he ordered his regiment of guards to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion

The count replied, that his orders mu&s;t be immediately obeyed. One of his battalions marched at $word$ in the night, through the Park to Whitehall; and were drawn up in order of battle, oppo&s;ite to the king's guards, with their matches lighted, ready to engage. The captain of the Engli&s;h guard refu&s;ed to quit his po&s;t until the king ordered him to march off the Parade. Then the Dutch troops took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the palace, and placed double &s;entries on the king's per&s;on. About midnight the three noblemen deputed by the prince arrived at Whitehall; and in&s;i&s;ted upon the king's being wakened, to give them audience. They recited the order in his hearing, and he acquie&s;ced in the prince's command; but, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of retiring to Roche&s;ter rather than to Richmond. The prince perceived his intention was to leave the kingdom; and in this hope readily complied with his reque&s;t. Next day the king &s;et out for that place, accompanied by the $word$ of Ayle&s;bury, Litchfield, Arran, and Dumbarton; and attended by a detach|ment of the Dutch guards.</P>

<P>The prince of Orange that &s;ame day fixed his re&s;idence at St James's, where he received the compliments of the nobility and the lord mayor of Lon|don; and his arrival was celebrated by the populace with public rejoicings. After having repo&s;ed him&s;elf a few days, he a&s;&s;embled all the nobility, to the number of three&s;core. He de&s;ired they would concert proper mea&s;ures for con|voking a free parliament for the pre&s;ervation of the prote&s;tant religion, and the &s;ecurity of the rights and liberties of the kingdom. Then he left them to their own deliberations. They voted an addre&s;s of thanks to his highne&s;$$ and re|&s;olved to meet every day in the hou&s;e of peers, that they might deliberate upon what he had recommended to their attention. The king finding him&s;elf &s;tripped of his authority, and reduced from the pinnacle of regal power to the lowe&s;t de|gree of dependence, re&s;olved to withdraw him&s;elf out of the reach of a people who had renounced his government, and a rival, from who&s;e ambition he did not think his life altogether &s;ecure. On the twenty-third day of December, he privately retired from Roche&s;ter, attended by his natural &s;on the duke of Berwick, and two dome&s;tics, to the &s;ea-&s;ide, where a ve&s;&s;el was prepared$ there embarking he &s;et &s;ail for France, and arrived at the port of Ambleteu&s;e; from whence he repaired to St. Germain, where he found his con&s;ort and the prince of Wales. He left a paper on his table at Roche&s;ter, written with his own hand. In this he complained of the di&s;repect with which he had been $word$ by the prince of Orange, who had rejected his propo&s;als by the earl of Fever&s;h$$; arre&s;ted that nobleman contrary to the law of nations; ordered his guards to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the palace by night; &s;ent an order to him&s;elf at midnight, commanding him to quit his own hou&s;e; invaded his dominions, and counte|nanced a malicious report, on purpo&s;e to deprive his infant &s;on of the $word$ He &s;aid he was born free, and de&s;ired to pre&s;erve his liberty: that he had often expo&s;ed his life for the honour of his country; and hoped so ven$$$e it once more to redeem it from &s;ubjection: that he would not run the ri&s;que of being rendered incapable to &s;erve his people, and therefore he had retired from con|finement; but, he &s;hould be always ready to fly to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the nation, whenever their eyes &s;hould be opened, &s;o as to &s;ee how much they had been

abu&s;ed by the pretexts of religion and liberty. He hoped God would touch the hearts of his &s;ubjects, and in&s;pire them with &s;entiments of moderation, that a free parliament might indulge all nonconformi&s;ts with liberty of con&s;cience, than which nothing would more contribute to the advantage and happine&s;s of the nation. Thus ended the reign of James II. a prince in whom &s;ome good qualities were rendered ineffectual by mi&s;taken notions of the prerogative, ex|ce&s;&s;ive bigotry to the religion of Rome, and an inflexible &s;everity of temper. He was brave, &s;teady, re&s;olute, diligent, upright, and &s;incere, except when warped by religious con&s;iderations; yet, even where religion was not concerned, he appears to have been proud, haughty, vindictive, cruel, and unrelenting; and though he approved him&s;elf an obedient and dutiful &s;ubject, he certainly became one of the mo&s;t intolerable &s;overeigns that ever reigned over a free people <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In this reign the &s;ettlement of Carolina and Pen&s;ylvania was completed.

<P>As the prince of Orange had been embarra&s;&s;ed by his pre&s;ence, &s;o now he was overjoyed at his retreat. James probably imagined that upon his retiring from the kingdom, a total ce&s;&s;ation of government would en&s;ue, and be attended with &s;uch anarchy, as would oblige the &s;ubjects, for their own &s;akes, to recal him to the throne: he deceived him&s;elf by this expectation. His departure was no &s;ooner known than the peers, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of hereditary juri&s;diction, re&s;olved to act as the guardians of the public. They pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the prince, de&s;iring he would take into his hands the admini&s;tration of the government, civil and military, the management of the public revenue, and the regulation of the affairs of Ireland, until a convention of the e&s;tates &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled. In another addre&s;s, they intreated him to &s;end orders to all the places that were ve&s;ted with the right of electing members, that they &s;hould in ten days chu&s;e repre&s;entatives to compo&s;e a convention, which might act as a parliament in &s;ettling the nation. Before the prince would take this &s;tep, he was re&s;olved to be authori&s;ed by the commons as well as by the peers. He publi&s;hed an order, requiring all tho&s;e who had &s;erved as members of parliament in the reign of Charles II. together with the lord mayor, alder|men, and fifty common-council men of London, to meet at St. James's, on the twenty-&s;ixth day of December, that he might con&s;ult them on the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs. They accordingly a&s;&s;embled at the appointed time, and adjourned to the hou&s;e of commons: there, after &s;ome debates upon the au|thority by which they had been convened, they drew up and pre&s;ented an ad|dre&s;s to the prince, de&s;iring he would take upon him&s;elf the charge of the admini&s;tration till the meeting of the convention, which they begged he would convoke for the twenty-&s;econd day of January. The prince a&s;&s;ured them he would comply with their advice, and concur with them in every mea&s;ure that<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$ Rapin.</NOTE> &s;hould be judged nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the kingdom. Being thus inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme authority, he ordered Barillon the French amba&s;&s;ador to quit the kingdom immediately. Next day he received the communion in the man|ner practi&s;ed in the church of England. He publi&s;hed a proclamation, autho|ri&s;ing all prote&s;tants who had public employments, to continue in the exerci&s;e of them till the meeting of the convention; and he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all the catholic

<P>The Scotti&s;h bi&s;hops had &s;ent an addre&s;s to the king, declaring<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1689.</NOTE> their abhorrence of the inva&s;ion threatened by the prince of Orange$ but his de&s;ign was extremely agreeable to the generality of people in that kingdom, who profe&s;&s;ed the pre&s;byterian religion. The retreat of James was no &s;ooner known at Edinburgh, than the chancellor of the kingdom re&s;igned the great &s;eal, and retired from that capital: then the populace a&s;&s;embling, in&s;ulted not only the catholics, but likewi&s;e the favourers of epi&s;copacy. They demoli&s;hed chapels and plundered hou&s;es; &s;o that the bi&s;hops were obliged to fly with the utmo&s;t precipitation, while many noblemen and others of that country repaired to London, to ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of the prince, and conform them&s;elves to the conduct of the Engli&s;h nation. Tho&s;e the prince a&s;&s;embled at St. James's, to the number of thirty lords and four&s;core gentlemen, who&s;e advice he de|manded with regard to the affairs of Scotland. From thence they repaired to Whitehall, and having cho&s;en the duke of Hamilton their pre&s;ident, deliberated upon the an&s;wer they &s;hould make to the prince of Orange. The earl of Arran propo&s;ed an addre&s;s to the king, de&s;iring he would return to Scot|land and convoke a parliament$ but this propo&s;al was unanimou&s;ly rejected. They be&s;ought the prince to a&s;&s;ume the reins of government in Scotland, and convoke the &s;tates of that kingdom for the fourteeenth day of March; and they received nearly the &s;ame an&s;wer which he had made to the Engli&s;h.</P>

<P>The &s;ettlement of Ireland was a ta&s;k of much greater difficulty. Tyrconnel commanded an army compo&s;ed of papi&s;ts, and it could not be imagined that he would voluntarily &s;ubmit to the prince's orders: yet as the lords and commons of England had intreated the prince to regulate the affairs of that kingdom, and he had received an addre&s;s from the prote&s;tant inhabitants, he could not help taking &s;ome notice of their intere&s;t. He wrote a letter to Tyt|connel, requiring him to &s;ubmit to the regulations that &s;hould be made in Eng|land. Colonel Hamilton undertook to deliver this letter, and inforce it in &s;uch a manner that the earl would &s;ubmit; but, far from performing his pro|mi&s;e, he encouraged him to &s;et the prince at defiance. It was at this juncture, that the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who had hitherto &s;tood $word$ went, ac|companied with eight other prelates, to make a tender of their &s;ervices to the prince, and &s;ub&s;cribed the a&s;&s;ociation: at the &s;ame time he was complimented by ninety pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters, who went in a body to pay their re&s;pects, and were civilly received. While the nation was employed in chu&s;ing repre&s;enta|tives, William &s;ent for the prince&s;s; but &s;he was for &s;ome time detained by a hard fro&s;t, which had locked up the harbours in Holland.</P>

<P>The convention meeting on the twenty-&s;econd day of January, each hou&s;e cho&s;e a &s;peaker; and then the prince's letter to both was read to this effect: that he had complied with their de&s;ires, in re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the peace and public &s;afety of the kingdom, and now it was their bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ecure their religion, laws, and liberties upon a certain foundation. He ob&s;erved, that the dangerous &s;ituation of the prote&s;tants in Ireland required Immediate relief; and that, except a di&s;union among them&s;elves, nothing could be more &s;atal to foreign connexions, than a delay in their deliberations; the &s;tates-ge|neral would have immediate occa&s;ion for the troops they had furni&s;hed, as well

as for the &s;peedy a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h, again&s;t a powerful enemy with whom they were at war: he per&s;uaded him&s;elf, that be&s;ides the obligation of treaties, they would be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Dutch as prote&s;tants and friends, who had expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch ardour for the pre&s;ervation of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution. The two hou&s;es immediately pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the prince, in which they ac|knowledged, that, under God, the nation was indebted to him for its de|liverance. They approved of his admini&s;tration; and begged he would con|tinue to manage the affairs of government, until they &s;hould have occa&s;ion to pre&s;ent another addre&s;s; and they promi&s;ed to pay the utmo&s;t deference to all the contents of his letter. They ordained a day of thank&s;giving for the happy deliverance of the nation; and the bi&s;hops, by command of the upper hou&s;e, in&s;erted in the &s;ervice of the day, a particular prayer for the prince of Orange. The king had written a letter to his privy-coun&s;ellors, nearly in the terms of the paper he had left at Roche&s;ter, and de&s;iring their advice in the pre&s;ent con|juncture. It was printed and publi&s;hed by his direction; but as he received no an&s;wer from tho&s;e to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, he &s;ent a letter to each hou&s;e of the convention; in which he promi&s;ed, on the word of a king, to grant a general indemnity, even to tho&s;e who had betrayed him, excepting a very few whom he could not with &s;afety forgive: but the two hou&s;es refu&s;ed to examine the contents.</P>

<P>On the twenty-eighth day of January, Mr. Dolben, in the lower hou&s;e, undertook to prove that the throne was vacated by the king's de|&s;ertion. After a debate that la&s;ted &s;everal hours, they voted, by a great ma|jority, that king James II. having endeavoured to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution of the kingdom, by breaking the original contract betwixt king and people; and having, by the advice of je&s;uits and other wicked per&s;ons, violated the funda|mental laws, and withdrawn him&s;elf out of the kingdom, had abdicated the government; and that the throne was thereby vacant: and that experience had &s;hewn, a prote&s;tant kingdom could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t under the government of a popi&s;h &s;overeign. As the elections had run in the old channel, without being expo&s;ed to any undue influence, almo&s;t all the repre&s;entatives of the boroughs were pre&s;byterians, who had now re&s;umed their former principles of rejecting the right of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But in the hou&s;e of peers the intere&s;t of the Tories was con&s;iderable. They now re&s;umed tho&s;e maxims of government, which they had depo&s;ited when they found them&s;elves threatened with imme|diate &s;lavery. Both parties had by this time forgot the coalition, and their former animo&s;ity revived.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; LXII.</HEAD>
<P>The lords, without acquie&s;cing in the vote of the commons, began to con&s;ider in what manner the government &s;hould be &s;ettled, &s;uppo&s;ing the thro$e was actually vacant. The earls of Roche&s;ter and Nottingham, leaders of the Tory party, propo&s;ed that the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould be pre&s;erved, and a regent appointed during the king's life, as if James was actually in a &s;tate of lunacy. They produced a recent in&s;tance of this expedient in Portugal, where, after the depo&s;ition of Alphon&s;o VI. his brother Don Pedro had been appointed regent of the kingdom. The marquis of Hallifax &s;peaker of the hou&s;e, and the earl of Danby, who headed the oppo&s;ite party, expatiated upon the difficulties, the confu&s;ion, and civil di&s;orders, that would probably attend a regency, oppo&s;ed by that very prince in who&s;e name it mu&s;t operate. The Tories urged, that the election of one king would form a precedent which
<PB N="549" REF="5510">
would produce &s;ucce&s;&s;ive conte&s;ts for the throne; &s;o that the peace of the na|tion would be continually interrupted, and the monarchy degenerate into a tur|bulent republic: be&s;ides, it would be expoted to ince&s;&s;ant danger, from the preten&s;ions of him who would claim the crown by the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; whereas &s;hould this be pre&s;erved intire, the admini&s;tration would one day fall$ into the hands of the true heir; and then all di&s;putes and di&s;orders would natu|rally cea&s;e. The Whigs in&s;i&s;ted upon the original contract, by which the people were intitled to take arms again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, and expel a tyrant from the throne. They explained the ab&s;urdity of re&s;i&s;ting or puni&s;hing the parti|&s;ans of a man, whom they acknowledged to be their lawful &s;overeign, in ca&s;e he &s;hould attempt to di&s;turb the peace of the kingdom, and grant com|mi&s;&s;ions to his adherents. They enumerated other inconveniences that would ari&s;e from a regency. They ob&s;erved, that unle&s;s they elected a new &s;overeign, they mu&s;t acknowledge the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of a child of a doubtful birth, who would be educated in principles de&s;tructive of the religion and liberty of the kingdom, and perpetuate tho&s;e maxims in his family and de&s;cendents.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="53" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; LXIII.</HEAD>
<P>After a long debate, a new &s;overeign was preferred to a regent, by a majority of two voices. Of all the prelates, the bi&s;hops of London and Bri&s;tol only, e&s;pou&s;ed this &s;ide of the que&s;tion. The archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury, who was a timo$ous man, ab&s;ented him&s;elf from the hou&s;e, that he might not be obliged to give his opinion on the &s;ubject. Next day the lords debated the que&s;tion, Whether there was actually an original contract between the king and people? And it was carried in the affirmative by a majority of &s;even voices. Then they di&s;puted upon the grammatical &s;ignification of the word "Abdicated," and agreed that "De&s;erted" &s;hould be u&s;ed in its place. The next word they examined was the term "Vacant;" and this que&s;tion was pro|po&s;ed: <Q>&startq;Whether, &s;uppo&s;ing king James had violated the original contract between him and his people, and abandoned the government, the throne was thereby become vacant?&endq;</Q> The Tories maintained, that by the laws of England, the king could never die: of con&s;equence the throne could not be vacant; and it pa&s;&s;ed in the negative by a majority of eleven: forty peers, how|ever, entered a prote&s;t again&s;t this deci&s;ion. Some of the Whig party moved that, &s;uppo&s;ing king James virtually dead, they &s;hould acknowledge the prince and prince&s;s of Orange king and queen of England: but this propo&s;al was re|jected by a &s;mall majority. On the &s;econd day of February, the lords &s;ent down the vote of the commons, with their amendments, which were not ap|proved by the lower hou&s;e. A conference was held, without producing an ac|commodation: then the commons appointed four and twenty members, to maintain the opinions of their hou&s;e, in a new conference; and the peers$ no|minated the earls of Nottingham, Clarendon, Roche&s;ter, and Pembroke, the bi&s;hop of Ely, and &s;ome others, to &s;upport their &s;entiments in favour of the amendments they had propo&s;ed. This conference was managed with great ability on the part of the commons, by Hambden, Somers, Holt, Maynard, Treby, Sacheverel, Po$$exfen, Sir Robert Howard, Sir Richard Temple, Foley, and Ayres: yet, rather than &s;hock the Tories by attacking their fa|vourite doctrines, they cho&s;e to wave &s;ome &s;trong arguments they might have deduced from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, the fir&s;t principles of the con&s;titution, and the natural right that, in &s;uch emergencies, the people certainly had to pro|vide
<PB N="550" REF="5520">
extraordinary remedies for the pre&s;ervation of the community. The re|port of this conference, made to the hou&s;e of peers, produced warm debates: but at length the majority agreed to de&s;i&s;t from their amendments; and the hou&s;e concurred with the vote of the commons, <Q>&startq;That king James had ab|dicated the government, and thereby the throne was become vacant.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>During the&s;e di&s;putes the prince of Orange remained at St. James's, without making the lea&s;t effort to increa&s;e the number of his parti&s;ans. Though naturally dry and phlegmatic, he was now more re&s;erved than ever; and the members of both hou&s;es were &s;urpri&s;ed, that no application was made to them in his behalf. At length &s;ending for the marquis of Halli$ax, the earls of Danby, Shrew&s;bury, and &s;ome other noblemen, he told them he had hitherto kept &s;ilence, that he might not &s;eem to interfere with the freedom of their delibe|rations. He &s;aid he knew &s;ome per&s;ons were inclined to a regency, to which he had no objection; but, for his own part, he would not undertake the office. Others, he ob&s;erved, were de&s;irous of rai&s;ing the prince&s;s to the throne; and that he &s;hou$d reign by her courte&s;y. He declared his profound $$$eem for the prince&s;s, but he was not of a humour to hold a crown dependent upon any woman upon earth; nor would he have any &s;hare in the government, unle&s;s inve&s;ted with it for life: neverthele&s;s, if they thought proper to act in another manner, he would give them no oppo&s;ition, but return to Holland, without meddling $urther in their affairs; but, in ca&s;e they &s;hould inve&s;t him with the royalty for life, he would agree that the po&s;terity of the prince&s;s Anne &s;hould be preferred to that which he might have by a &s;econd marriage.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; LXV.</HEAD>
<P>When the hou&s;e of peers proceeded to deliberate upon an expedient to fill the vacant throne, Halli$ax propo&s;ed that the prince of Orange &s;hould reign alone, and the prince&s;&s;es &s;ucceed in order, at his death. This motion gave ri&s;e to violent debates; and the two hou&s;es began to be divided into parties. The earl of Danby &s;ent an expre&s;s to the prince&s;s o$ Orange, with an a&s;&s;urance that if &s;he cho&s;e to reign alone, he had intere&s;t enough to carry that point in her favour: &s;he replied that &s;he was the prince's wi$e, and would never cheri&s;h a &s;eparate intere&s;t from that of her hu&s;band, to whom &s;he tran&s;mitted the earl's letter. At la&s;t the two hou&s;es agreed, and each voted apart, that the prince and prince&s;s of Orange &s;hould reign jointly as king and queen of England$ and that the admini&s;tration &s;hould be in the hands of the prince alone. This vote, however, pa&s;&s;ed, by a very &s;mall majority, in the upper hou&s;e, and not without a formal prote&s;t by the oppo&s;ite party.

<P>And whereas the &s;aid late king James the &s;e|cond, having abdicated the government, and the throne being thereby vacant, his highne&s;s the prince of Orange (whom it hath plea&s;ed Al|mighty God to make the glorious in&s;trument of delivering this kingdom from popery and arbi|trary power) did (by the advice of the lords &s;pi|ritual and temporal, and divers principal per&s;ons of the commons) cau&s;e letters to be written to the lords &s;piritual and temporal, being prote|&s;tants, and other letters to the &s;everal counties, cities, univer&s;ities, burroughs, and cinque-ports, for the chu&s;ing of &s;uch per&s;ons to repre&s;ent $word$ as were of right to be &s;ent to parliament, to meet and &s;it at We&s;tmin&s;ter, upon the twenty-&s;econd day of January$ in this year 1688, in or|der to &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment$ as that their reli|gion, laws and liberties, might not again be in danger of being &s;ubverted: Upon which let|ters, elections having been accordingly made; and thereupon the lords &s;piritual and temporal, and commons, pur&s;uant to their &s;everal letters and elections, being now a&s;&s;embled in a full and free repre&s;entative of this nation, taking into their mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration the be&s;t means for attaining the ends afore&s;aid, do in the fir&s;t place (as their ance&s;tors in like ca&s;e have u&s;ually done) for vindicating and a&s;&s;erting their ancient rights and liberties; declare$</P>
<P>1. That the pretended power of &s;u&s;pending laws$ or execution of laws, by legal authority, without con&s;ent of parliament, is illegal. 2. That the pretended power of di&s;pen&s;ing with laws, or the execution of laws, by regal autho|rity, as it hath been a&s;&s;umed and exerci&s;ed of late, is illegal. 3. That the commi&s;&s;ion for erecting the late court of commi&s;&s;ioners for ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, and all other commi&s;&s;ions and courts of the like nature, are illegal and perni|cious. 4. That levying of money for or to the u&s;e of the crown, by pretence of prerogative, without grant of parliament, for longer time, or in any other manner than the &s;ame is or &s;hall be granted, is illegal. 5. That it is the right of the &s;ubjects to petition the king, and all commitments and pro&s;ecutions for &s;uch petition|ing, are illegal. 6. That the rai&s;ing or keep|ing a &s;tanding-army within the kingdom in time of peace, unle&s;s it be with con&s;ent of parliament, is again&s;t law. 7. That the &s;ubjects, which are prote&s;tants, may have arms for their defence &s;uitable to their condition, and as allowed by law. 8. That elections of members of parlia|ment ought to be free. 9. That the freedom of &s;peech, and debates or proceedings in parlia|ment, ought not to be impeached or que&s;tioned in any court or place out of parliament. 10. That exce&s;&s;ive bail ought not to be required, nor exce&s;&s;ive fines impo&s;ed, nor cruel and un|u&s;ual puni&s;hments inflicted. 11. That jurors ought to be duly empannelled and returned, and jurors which pa&s;s upon men in trials of high-trea&s;on ought to be freeholders. 12. That all grants and promi&s;es of fines and forfeitures of particular per&s;ons, before conviction, are illegal and void. 13. And that for redre&s;s of all grie|vances, and for the amending, &s;trengthening and pr$$$rving of the laws$ parliament$ ought to be held frequently.</P>

<P>And the &s;aid lords &s;piritual and temporal, and commons, do pray the &s;aid prince and prince&s;s of Orange, to accept the &s;ame accordingly: And that the oaths hereafter mentioned be taken by all per&s;ons of whom the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy might be required by law, in$$e$d of them; and that the &s;aid oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy be abrogated: I A.
