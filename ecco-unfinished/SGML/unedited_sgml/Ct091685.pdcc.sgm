<P>THE following LETTERS are undoubtedly genuine; and are now fir&s;t publi&s;hed from the Originals, by Mr. JOHN HODGETTS, of Hagley, in Worce&s;ter&s;hire, Exe|cutor to the late WILLIAM SHEN|STONE, E&s;quire. The Writer of them was &s;o well known, that to &s;ay any thing concerning her on this occa&s;ion, would be as &s;uper|fluous as it would be to attempt to give a character of the Letters. They mu&s;t &s;peak for them&s;elves. Yet it may not be improper to inform the Reader, that in the original Manu&s;cript Volume of the&s;e

Letters, which had been bound together by Mr. Shen&s;tone, in the fir&s;t leaf he had written with his own hand, as follows:</P>

They com|menced in the year 1739, and were continued to the year of her death (1756), with &s;ome few &endq;intermi&s;&s;ions.</Q></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITHOUT the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of your pen, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for me to return Mr. Shen&s;tone &s;ufficient thanks for the honour he does me, and my humble habitation; and for the agreeable entertainment his ver&s;es afford me: to you, Sir, I owe the plea&s;ure of hav|ing enjoyed that gentleman's conver&s;ation a few moments; to you I owe the advantage of being repre&s;ented to him in the mo&s;t flat|tering light; and to you I de&s;ire to owe the favour of &s;peaking my gratitude for his gen|teel compliment, and my admiration of all he

As you, Sir, have the art to de&s;cribe the mo&s;t &s;imple things with the nice&s;t elegance (as appears by your Pa&s;toral) I mu&s;t once more intreat you to make known to your friend, the &s;incerity of my heart in the approbation it gives to his works; to which it pays ju&s;t prai&s;e, though my words could no more expre&s;s it (without doing wrong to my &s;entiments) than they could utter the real e&s;teem, and friendly regard, with which I am, Sir,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF my doing barely ju&s;tice, in commending the beauty of your &s;ituation, and the ele|gance of your ta&s;te, can make you vain, you mu&s;t not admit of any company, if you will be|come a rigid hermit; nor &s;hould I have ventured a vi&s;it to the Lea&s;owes, where the more one &s;ees, the more one admires, and that admiration leads towards envy, which, as an hermite&s;s, I ought to &s;hun.</P>
<P>I return thanks, not only for the agreeable reception you gave me, but al&s;o for your kind enquiry now. I got home &s;afe, but had one downfal, a little beyond Birmingham, which however did no hurt to Mr. Outing nor me; nor was it any di&s;honour to my po&s;tillion, as the night was very dark, and the moon down, or at lea&s;t clouded over: but we met with very

unho&s;pitable treatment at Shirley-&s;treet, where they refu&s;ed to receive us at the Saracen's Head, though it was but eleven o'clock, and we &s;aw a good fire in the kitchen; and a maid, who was &s;itting by it, took her candle and went to bed, whil&s;t we were at the door intreating, knocking, and at la&s;t threatening, but all in vain: the &s;tars took pity of us, and appeared ju&s;t as our ho&s;te&s;s di&s;appeared, and guided us in a friendly man|ner to Barrells, where we arrived at pa&s;t one o'clock, and the next day regaled our&s;elves with the be&s;t pine-apple I ever eat; &s;ince which time, I have talked of nothing but the beauty of Virgil's grove, and the meanne&s;s of my own; which u&s;ed to give me &s;ome plea&s;ure, but is &s;o much le&s;&s;ened in my e&s;teem, by comparing it with yours, that I could almo&s;t wi&s;h I had not &s;een the latter.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Outing, who left this place on Satur|day la&s;t, de&s;ired the inclo&s;ed might be conveyed to you; and I take the &s;ame opportu|nity of conveying my excu&s;es for the incivility you mu&s;t think me guilty of, in not ri&s;ing the day you left Barrells, to wi&s;h you a good journey, and to thank you for the favour of your com|pany. The not doing &s;o, carried an appear|ance even of ingratitude, as your vi&s;it had given me &s;o much plea&s;ure; nor can your own good na|ture have been my advocate farther, than by low|ering my crime, in calling it lazine&s;s; to which I would plead guilty, but that, in fact, my inten|tion was to get up when the &s;ervant came in to light my fire, but was prevented, by her telling me you was in bed, and, &s;he believed, was not to go away that day: this good news indulged me; and I, with the tranquillity &s;atisfaction gives, took another nap; but waking, found it only an agreeable dream; for you was gone. Mr. Outing, the in&s;tant I came down &s;tairs, pre&s;ented me with a &s;ong, which he &s;aid he found upon your table; and I read it eagerly,
<PB N="8" REF="12">
&s;oon finding it to be your &s;tile. It is not nece&s;|&s;ary to add, that I thought it extremely pretty, and very poetical; but if it had been in pro&s;e, I &s;hould have been tempted to a&s;k who was that ASTERIA that could make her <HI>hearths</HI> cheerful to you in the rigid &s;ea&s;on, when I, who had &s;o lately been favoured with your company, was too &s;en&s;ible 'twas not in my power to make mine &s;o, though nobody could wi&s;h it more; but want of &s;un and want of genius is ill &s;up|plied by a coal-fire, which was all I had to give; and my ill health unluckily at that time added to my &s;tupidity, when I mo&s;t wi&s;hed for &s;pirits to entertain my agreeable company: and now that I have entirely recovered my health, I have lo&s;t my company. Such are the chequered chances of this life! &s;o that my <HI>hermite&s;s</HI> and I have entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my little wood, without either fear or hope of being interrupted in our contemplations. I contentedly &s;ub&s;cribe to what &s;he has wrote upon her old tree;
<Q>"The world forgetting, by the world forgot:"</Q>
but would not include in that world the friends I e&s;teem, and who&s;e conver&s;ation I admire: nor can ever any of the di&s;agreeable events in LIFE make me wi&s;h it to become un&s;ociable whil&s;t it la&s;ts; but cities (no more than fore&s;ts) do not
<PB N="9" REF="13">
afford &s;ociety; it is the <HI>conver&s;ation</HI> of a cho&s;en few that &s;mooths the rugged road of life: &s;uch as <HI>yours</HI> &s;trews it with <HI>flowers</HI>; but as <HI>they</HI> &s;oon fade, &s;o did <HI>you</HI> vani&s;h, and all the company that &s;urrounded my <HI>hearth</HI>; which, though aban|doned, will afford me &s;uch conver&s;ation as the pen can &s;upply, whil&s;t I have the plea&s;ure of reading your thoughts; which plea&s;ure I hope you will not deny me, but rather &s;end me any thing they may happen to add to the collection I have; than which nothing can be more e&s;teemed by, Sir,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE apprehen&s;ion that the farmer who car|ried Inigo Jones's de&s;igns, and a letter in the book from me to you, may have delivered them to a wrong per&s;on at Birmingham, is the occa&s;ion of my troubling you with this, to let you know that I did not fail to &s;end it the very fir&s;t market day after I received the favour of yours; and he &s;ays he delivered it to a man at the po&s;t-hou&s;e, but the po&s;t-mi&s;tre&s;s (who, they tell me, is not the milde&s;t nor mo&s;t obliging dame) a&s;&s;ured Par&s;on Holyoak, &s;he received no &s;uch thing; and upon his a&s;king her, if &s;he hap|pened to have any letter &s;ince, directed for me, &s;he &s;aid, No! neither did &s;he know me, or would trouble her&s;elf about it. Which I men|tion, that in ca&s;e you write, you will be plea&s;ed to &s;end your's to Ma&s;ter Franky Holyoak, at Mr. Bolton's, whole&s;ale Toymaker, upon Snow-Hill, in Birmingham.

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Barrells, <DATE>Ea&s;ter Sunday, 1748.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is rather to oblige the ambulatory old gentlewoman who delivers you your letters with &s;o much alacrity, than it is to oblige her <HI>be&s;t ma&s;ter</HI>, that I write again &s;o &s;oon; for I am too &s;en&s;ible <HI>my</HI> letters will but ill repay the plea|&s;ure I receive from <HI>his</HI>; &s;o that I ought to make a longer pau&s;e, and not interrupt my friends in <HI>better company, better thoughts</HI>, and <HI>better diver&s;ions</HI>, as Swift expre&s;&s;es it. If that con&s;ideration was ju&s;t, which made him <HI>pau&s;e a few weeks</HI> betwixt his letters, I ought to pau&s;e years, or rather never write at all; that would be more polite; but it would make me fancy my&s;elf ungrateful, and con&s;equently make me hate my&s;elf. It is therefore <HI>&s;elf-love</HI> which urges me to take this early opportunity of returning thanks for your
<PB N="12" REF="16">
la&s;t letter, wrote on Lady-Day. However de|pre&s;&s;ed your <HI>&s;pirits</HI> might be when you wrote it, it revived mine; for it is not in the power even of the north-ea&s;t wind to depre&s;s your <HI>genius</HI>; and to <HI>that</HI> we owe thoughts which mu&s;t plea&s;e, how|ever negligently they may be dre&s;&s;ed: &mdash; the &s;tiffen-bodied gown would not add charms, I believe, to a beautiful woman, no more than Voiture's laboured turns of expre&s;&s;ion add to his &s;tile: and friend&s;hip undoubtedly &s;hews it&s;elf in the be&s;t light, when lea&s;t adorned by art. There|fore I hope you will never deprive me of the plea&s;ure your letters give me, nor defer it, be|cau&s;e your &s;pirits may not ju&s;t then allow you to &s;end them out in their be&s;t apparel; it is &s;uffi|cient you <HI>can</HI> do &s;o; and they'll always be as welcome to me in their common garb, which is yet richer than you &s;eem to imagine. I follow the rule I give, and write what comes upper|mo&s;t; but it is in <HI>me</HI> a fault, as I am not pri|vileged to do &s;o by any of the gifts of nature, except artle&s;s &s;incerity be one.</P>
<P>I read your four &s;onnets with much plea&s;ure; and am obliged to you for the trouble of tran&s;cribing them: they are truly poetical, yet have an ea&s;e as well as delicacy in the turn of thought and expre&s;&s;ion, which mu&s;t, I believe, be agreeable to all, whether good judges by their
<PB N="13" REF="17">
&s;kill and learning, or only judges of good &s;en&s;e and nature. If Dod&s;ley gives a &s;econd edition of his well-cho&s;en collection, I hope you will not let your School-mi&s;tre&s;s be unaccompanied by all her parent's offspring. Now that the boi&s;terous baneful month of March is over, and that the &s;un re&s;umes his power, I hope, and &s;hall expect to &s;ee the productions of your imagina|tion, as much as I &s;hall expect to &s;ee tho&s;e of my parterre, my &s;hrubbery, or grove; and if joined to that &s;atisfaction I have your company here, I &s;hall give double prai&s;es to the returning &s;pring. Mr. Whi&s;tler, or any friend of yours, will be perfectly welcome; but remember, that though I &s;hall be a great gainer by <HI>his</HI> con|ver&s;ation, I &s;hall al&s;o be a lo&s;er by his hearing <HI>mine</HI>, and his &s;eeing this poor hermitage; of both which he may perchance have formed an advantageous idea, by your partial account of them; and <HI>that</HI> idea will in&s;tantly be de&s;troyed, unle&s;s you have been as &s;ilent as Mr. Outing was about the Lea&s;owes, before I had &s;een it: his caution was well judged, but wrong placed. But to &s;hew you that I do not prefer fame (e&s;pe|cially unmerited fame) to plea&s;ure and improve|ment, I de&s;ire you to bring him, though at the expence of his being undeceived. I have read over his Shuttlecock &s;everal times, and each
<PB N="14" REF="18">
time with redoubled plea&s;ure. 'Tis certainly a beautiful poem: I own my&s;elf a very indifferent judge, but it plea&s;es me. It is an uncommon performance, and what many older and more famed poets would be proud of, whatever <HI>juvenile</HI> faults there may be in it; but, I think, the au|thor's youth may rather be remarked by the great &s;pirit and vivacity of his thoughts, than by any errors in his judgment; but if any &s;uch there be, you are his friend, and will have a very ea&s;y ta&s;k in your critici&s;m, if you &s;hould object to a few words, in order to let it appear perfect to the world, if our pre&s;ent world is elegant enough to be worthy of it. Its name, and part of its character, had reached my ears before I &s;aw it, but not from you. I think his &s;imilies exceeding apt, and his digre&s;&s;ions ju&s;t and lively: if &s;o &s;light a &s;ubject, at &s;o early an age, could be worked up &s;o well, he certainly is capable of rai&s;ing the intrin&s;ic value of any more weighty, or more lofty &s;ubject he undertakes.</P>
<P>Your remark upon Fitzo&s;borne's Letters is mo&s;t ju&s;t; for letters that are, or even &s;eem to be, wrote <HI>for the pre&s;s</HI>, never plea&s;e like others: yet they are, I think, wrote in good language, and &s;hew, I believe, polite learning and judg|ment; and the &s;tile would be unexceptionable, I fancy, in <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI>; but familiar letters require a
<PB N="15" REF="19">
more familiar addre&s;s. I find &s;everal more are promi&s;ed, if the&s;e &s;ucceed. I wi&s;h &s;ome labori|ous pen may not be writing in the name of that author, and overwhelm us with his <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> let|ters; the&s;e, however, are genuine, as I &s;uppo&s;e, though I never heard of that gentleman; and am obliged to you for your explanation of the character of Mezentius; that, in particular, might prevent the real names being publi&s;hed: they would have made the book infinitely more intere&s;ting; but if that could not be, I don't know whether feigned but common modern names, might not have plea&s;ed better, as they would have &s;eemed real.</P>
<P>You are welcome to Inigo Jones's de&s;igns, as long as they can be of &s;ervice to you; and in return, I beg the favour of you to &s;end me the height and thickne&s;s of your wall that has arches &s;unk in it, and the depth, breadth, and height of tho&s;e arches; and let me know whether they are plai&s;tered on the in&s;ide, and if any ornament is on the top, or only a coping: it is to build in &s;ummer a bit of wall (as you advi&s;ed) to &s;kreen me from the cottage that is contiguous to my garden, in lieu of the garden-&s;eat which you and we all thought did not an&s;wer the hopes I had of it. If I do build that &s;eat, it &s;hall be to terminate &s;ome walk or view.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="20">The chimney in my &s;tudy was not exactly in the middle of the room; which has occa&s;ioned my moving it twelve inches, and con&s;equently moving Pope's bu&s;t to be in the center. The lines wrote over it are put up again, (which, you know, are out of Virgil) but the &s;tucco at the back of it mu&s;t be new done, and the flat pieces of wain&s;cot that make the margins of it, were never ornamented. Perhaps you would invent &s;ome more elegant ornament, if you would be&s;tow a thought upon it; or the &s;tucco might be ju&s;t as before, only &s;ome foliage or other carving, to drop down the &s;ides. Mi&s;s Merediths write word, that the pre&s;ent fa&s;hion at London, is all lead carving, which ladies do them&s;elves, by cutting India, or other thin lead with &s;ci&s;&s;ors, and &s;haping it into flowers, knots, &amp;c. and fixing it to a wire, which is afterwards nailed on in the form de&s;igned; and the carving is either gilt, or el&s;e painted the colour of the &s;tucco or wain&s;cot, according as &s;uits the place.</P>
<P>I &s;end this to the Birmingham po&s;t-office, (as you ordered) by a chance per&s;on. If you write an an&s;wer &s;oon, pray direct it to Mr. Iron|monger, Ma&s;ter of the Ca&s;tle-Inn, to be for|warded to me, (for Franky Holyoak is at home) and there is no po&s;t nor certain convey|ance

You will allow this to be &s;ome merit; at lea&s;t, you would allow it, if you knew how great is my propen&s;ity to write to you; it being always with the &s;elfi&s;h view of procuring in return &s;ome compo&s;ition of yours. My &s;elf-denial this time has been great, but it is well rewarded by the favour of your la&s;t letter, and Mr. Whi&s;tler's Flower-Piece; the moral of which is perfectly ju&s;t, and the thought very genteel and elegant. In this, as well as in his other Poem which you &s;ent me, I think one may ob&s;erve a great delicacy of imagination: the words altered with a pencil &s;eem to be much for the better, e&s;pecially the fir&s;t line. <Q>As for his &s;entiment on enjoying things by reflec|tion, I am not yet a convert to it, but am rather of your mind, that &startq;an ab&s;ent plea&s;ure is equi|valent &endq;to a pre&s;ent pain."</Q> For in&s;tance, if I was fond of London and its amu&s;ements, or had a ta&s;te for public places, I feel that it would give me pain to &s;ee St. James's, Vauxhall, Ra|nelagh, &amp;c. &amp;c. repre&s;ented in &s;o lively a man|ner as I &s;ee them through an optical gla&s;s which I have lately purcha&s;ed, now that I am ab&s;ent from them: but as I never was fond of a crowd, I enjoy tho&s;e places as much as I de&s;ire in this reflected way, without wi&s;hing my&s;elf at them;

and I can look on the buildings and gardens of Stowe in the &s;ame manner, and with plea&s;ure, becau&s;e I never was there. But were you to pre&s;ent me with the Views of the Lea&s;owes, I own I &s;hould not put them into my &s;how-box without pain, nor &s;ee them well repre&s;ented without regret; as it would remind me of the agreeable day I &s;pent there, and my lo&s;t plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>Your friend Mr. Graves's Lamentation is very pretty and pathetic, and &s;eems to come from the heart: he mu&s;t, I think, be very &s;in|cerely and very &s;trongly in love; and yet I can|not but think <HI>that</HI> very incon&s;i&s;tent with his parting voluntarily from his Lucy, and with his &s;ending her to London, without any jea|lou&s;y: and I confe&s;s I al&s;o think it incon&s;i&s;tent that a man, who may be &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;pi&s;e the opinion of the world, (&s;ince he marries &s;o much below him&s;elf, and what the world would re|commend) &s;hould part from <HI>her</HI> he &s;o dearly loves, only to give her an education proper to plea&s;e that world which he &s;eems to de&s;pi&s;e; for it is plain, &s;he plea&s;es <HI>him</HI> without that edu|cation. How does he know, but that by lo&s;ing her rural innocent air, however &s;he may im|prove in her dancing-ma&s;ter's opinion, &s;he may le&s;&s;en in <HI>his</HI>, and her acquired charms may not
<PB N="20" REF="24">
plea&s;e him as her native charms did the town? Perhaps I judge wrong, and yet I think it &s;eems to be a natural way of judging. How|ever, as he is your friend, I wi&s;h him happy, and hope &s;he will not have the fate you threaten your ro&s;e-bud, and I threaten my bull-finch with; which la&s;t (&s;ince I have happened to mention it) I mu&s;t tell you, is a little fooli&s;h <HI>impromptu</HI> I wrote in a letter to our friend Outing, who&s;e an&s;wer was, that notwith&s;tanding the moral of my &s;ong, he went the night he received it to the Oratorio of Judas Maccabaeus, where he was highly entertained; and he &s;peaks with &s;uch ec&s;ta&s;y of the mu&s;ic, as I confe&s;s I cannot conceive any one can feel who under|&s;tands no more of mu&s;ic than my&s;elf; which I take to be his ca&s;e. But I &s;uppo&s;e he &s;ets his judgment true to that of the multitude; for if his ear is not nice enough to di&s;tingui&s;h the harmony, it &s;erves to hear what the multitude &s;ay of it. He <HI>would</HI> be offended, if he &s;hould know that I think his &s;inging much upon a par with my poetry; and you <HI>ought</HI> to be of|fended that I &s;end you &s;uch fooli&s;h lines: but he might have happened to mention them to you, and as they are not worth the trouble of a&s;king for, I prevent you, by &s;ending them, and hope you will throw them in the fire when you
<PB N="21" REF="25" MS="Y">
have read them: for they are not worth &s;hewing to any, but one who, like you, is capable of ex|cu&s;ing all faults in a friend, and who will not account it one in me, that I am no <HI>Poete&s;s</HI>; which reproachful name I would avoid, even if I were capable of acquiring it; for which rea|&s;on I hope you will throw the Epi&s;tle the Bo&s;|tangy has &s;ent you into the flames, with the Song, and forget I ever wrote in <HI>ver&s;e</HI> my real opinion in pro&s;e of the Lea&s;owes' beauties.</P>
<P>I am impatient for your E&s;&s;ay, e&s;pecially as you tell me there is in it a re&s;emblance of your&s;elf. I hope you will give me rules for oeconomy; nobody wants them more: but I &s;u&s;pect you will not give me &s;uch as I might learn between Temple-Bar and the Stones End. In &s;hort, I have no great opinion of your rudiments in this &s;cience, though per|haps you may know the theory better than the practice of it: and you may be a good &s;pecu|lative oeconomi&s;t for what I know; but I ne|ver met with a practical one in a &s;oul where genero&s;ity and benevolence had a place, or to which a bright genius was joined.</P>
<P>I lament with you the lo&s;s of Lady Lyttelton, though I had not the honour of being per&s;onally acquainted with her; but her character was known, and all &s;ociety mu&s;t mourn &s;o good a
<PB N="22" REF="26">
member of it, and all the poor &s;o good a bene|factre&s;s.</P>
<P>Your advice about my chimney plea&s;ed me greatly; but forced oeconomy forbids my fol|lowing it: be&s;ides that good carving is too fine for my humble roof. The room, con&s;ider, is only hung with &s;ixpenny paper, and is &s;o low that I have but five inches between Pope's Head and the Motto over it: &s;o that I can neither have a compartment for that, nor an architrave, as is at Houghton. The contra&s;t between that place and Barrells is &s;o great, that it is ludicrous to name them together: and yet I allow with you, that the chimney in the din|ing-room there, might give one a hint for my little one; but I have not height enough for it. Upon the whole, as your thought was too good to reject, I have employed my friend Williams (in New-&s;treet, Birmingham) to paint the orna|ments you would have had carved, in &s;tone-colours, pretty &s;trongly &s;haded to appear to ri&s;e like carving; and I &s;ent him one of the two &s;ketches you &s;ent me, that he might the better comprehend what ornaments he was to intro|duce. When my brother Bolingbroke built Dawley, which he cho&s;e to call a Farm, he had his hall painted in &s;tone-colours, with all the implements of hu&s;bandry placed in the manner
<PB N="23" REF="27">
one &s;ees or might &s;ee arms and trophies in &s;ome General's hall; and it had an effect that plea&s;ed every body. I believe Pope mentions it in one of his letters to Swift.&mdash;Mr. Williams is going to paint two ceilings for Mr. An&s;on (elder bro|ther to my Lord An&s;on) in Stafford&s;hire; one of them is for the Chine&s;e room: I believe he has &s;ketched them out at Birmingham, but is to go to paint them as &s;oon as the Parliament ri&s;es. &mdash;Mr. Outing writes that he has &s;ent you a bu&s;t of Pope done to look like marble, and that Rack&s;trow is doing four in that manner for my brother Sir John.&mdash;I &s;hould like to &s;ee your &s;tandi&s;h.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more ju&s;t than the critici&s;m upon the Play in the Magazine.&mdash;If you read French, I could &s;end you a play ju&s;t acted at Paris; Lady Bolingbroke &s;ent it me: the chief character is a man who makes it his &s;ole bu&s;i|ne&s;s and his &s;ole plea&s;ure to make mi&s;chief, even where he can get nothing by it: it is very well drawn, and I wi&s;h one did not &s;ee &s;o many people like it.</P>
<P>If ever I have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing your compo&s;itions all together, I could wi&s;h to have them ornamented in the manner of Pine's Ho|race, by your&s;elf; where you would &s;hew your ta&s;te in a double capacity, as poet and painter.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS is the fir&s;t opportunity I have had of &s;ending you the French Comedy you de&s;ire, and of an&s;wering your query about your &s;tandi&s;h. My advice is not worth a&s;king in &s;uch matters; but &s;ince you do me the favour to a&s;k it, it is this:</P>
<P>You have forty ounces of old plate, which, at five &s;hillings and &s;ixpence per ounce, amounts to eleven pounds. You have an inclination to indulge your fancy without much expence: you may then make your &s;tandi&s;h to weigh only thirty ounces, which, at eight &s;hillings, (which is, I find, the price demanded) will come to
<PB N="25" REF="29">
twelve pounds: &s;o that it will co&s;t your pocket but twenty &s;hillings, and I am per&s;uaded will weigh enough for a &s;tandi&s;h, if the dimen&s;ions you intended to make it of are &s;o large that thirty ounces will make the &s;ilver too thin. I &s;uppo&s;e there will be no hurt in making it le&s;s in &s;ize, as the ta&s;te will be equally &s;hewn; and I imagine the u&s;e will be much the &s;ame: but of this I cannot judge, becau&s;e I never &s;aw your draught.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed I received from Lady Hertford, to whom I had &s;ent your Ballad of Queen Eli|zabeth, knowing it would &s;uit her ta&s;te, and be|lieving you would pardon me, as I &s;ent it upon the footing of a trifle; but I will not &s;end more of your compo&s;itions without your permi&s;&s;ion: I therefore beg you will &s;end me back her letter by the very fir&s;t opportunity, (as I wait for <HI>that</HI> to an&s;wer it) and &s;ay which of the things I have of yours you permit me or forbid me to &s;end; for I &s;hall religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve your directions about that, as well as about <HI>Daw&s;on's Ditty</HI>, which I &s;hall like to &s;ee in print, and to keep &s;ilence. I have heard <HI>that</HI> &s;ung which he made ju&s;t before his execution, and which was not made for him. Your <HI>Kid</HI> moves compa&s;&s;ion; but it is comfort to think (as you ob&s;erve) how many evils it would have done, if it had lived to
<PB N="26" REF="30">
be old; and many it al&s;o might have received. Do not imagine what you write can be <HI>middling</HI>; if ever you &s;hould cea&s;e to write <HI>well</HI>, you will certainly write <HI>ill:</HI> for I am &s;ure you never <HI>com|promi&s;ed</HI> with Apollo, whatever your friend Greaves may do with the <HI>world</HI>.</P>
<P>The Duke of Newca&s;tle <HI>Pantin</HI> charms me, and I don't doubt but it made the peace. I am in doubt, when I hear of this polite fa&s;hion, whether it is a mark that the world is returned to its infancy, (as old people grow childi&s;h) or whether it be not &s;ome coquetti&s;h invention, that Mr. Pantin may &s;ay in dumb &s;how what the Lady who wears him cannot &s;ay for her&s;elf. If this &s;uppo&s;ition &s;hould be thought &s;evere upon their reputations, at lea&s;t it &s;aves them from the imputation of folly and childi&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>Had Shake&s;peare been u&s;ed to gather rents, he would not have &s;aid
<Q>"For who &s;o firm, that cannot be &s;educ'd?"</Q>
&s;ince your half day in endeavouring to <HI>&s;educe</HI> your tenant into paying you for half a year was <HI>ineffectual</HI>, and as my labours that way are as vain. My &s;ucce&s;s in <HI>receiving</HI> money is very &s;imilar to yours; and if what you &s;ay about the <HI>butter-di&s;h</HI> and the <HI>&s;luice</HI> is true as to you, it is no le&s;s &s;o as to me. The parallel between us may
<PB N="27" REF="31">
be carried yet farther; for I am as backward as you at <HI>wringing from the hard hands of pea&s;ants their vile tra&s;h</HI>; nor could I ever be forced, even by experience, into a proper <HI>veneration for &s;ix|pence</HI>, or have the fore&s;ight to nur&s;e Fortune; but however, to <HI>eat one's cake</HI> when one is <HI>a-hungered</HI>, is mo&s;t &s;weet.&mdash;The late King George was fond of peaches &s;tewed in brandy in a par|ticular manner, which he had ta&s;ted at my fa|ther's; and ever after, till his death, my mamma furni&s;hed him with a &s;ufficient quantity to la&s;t the year round (<HI>he</HI> eating two every night). This little pre&s;ent he took kindly: but one &s;ea&s;on proved fatal to fruit-trees, and &s;he could pre&s;ent his Maje&s;ty but with half the u&s;ual quantity, de&s;iring him to u&s;e oeconomy, for they would barely &s;erve him the year at <HI>one</HI> each night. Being thus forced by nece&s;&s;ity to retrench, he &s;aid he would then eat <HI>two</HI> every other night; and valued him&s;elf upon having mortified him|&s;elf le&s;s, than if he had yielded to their regula|tion of one each night; which, I &s;uppo&s;e, may be called a compromi&s;e between oeconomy and epicuri&s;m; but I leave it to your deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>As little as I love money, and as well as I love Lady Hertford and admire her judgment, I grudge &s;ix &s;hillings for Hervey's Meditations, becau&s;e you &s;ay they are <HI>&s;ometimes affected</HI>, and
<PB N="28" REF="32">
that he admires Dr. <HI>Young</HI>, whom I have not wit enough to admire (I hope Lady Hertford don't hear me): but I want to &s;ee the fronti&s;|pieces, becau&s;e Dr. Wall is &s;o ingenious a man, that I am per&s;uaded he gives nothing to the pub|lic but what is worthy of per&s;ons of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>I am glad you can read French; not that it is my favourite language by any means, but I think there are &s;o many things of delicacy wrote in it, that it mu&s;t give you plea&s;ure; and their commentators are worthy to be con&s;ulted, and, if not <HI>approved</HI>, at lea&s;t to be <HI>compared</HI> with ours. As to the pronunciation, the <HI>ear</HI> mu&s;t teach it, <HI>not</HI> the <HI>eye</HI>. When you favour me with a vi&s;it, I will be the <HI>a&s;s in the Toga</HI>, if you plea&s;e, as far as pronunciation goes.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILST you was prevented from read|ing the play by your Brother's &s;evere illne&s;s, I was prevented an&s;wering yours of the fir&s;t in&s;tant, by my own illne&s;s, of which I have not been many days recovered. The medi|cines the apothecary thought proper to give me, (though they did me good) lowered my &s;pirits, and made me incapable of attending to any agreeable amu&s;ement; &s;o that Lady Hert|ford's letter remains <HI>unan&s;wered</HI>, and the books that you and &s;he recommend, <HI>unread:</HI> I cannot give you a &s;tronger proof that my di&s;order was real. It has now left me in a great mea&s;ure, and I will &s;et about what I was obliged to neglect, but will leave Mr. Hervey's Meditations for the la&s;t; not (as the French &s;ay) <HI>pour faire bonne bouche</HI>, but, on the contrary, becau&s;e I am not &s;o eager to read them as the poems; and my curio&s;ity as to Dr. Wall's Fronti&s;pieces is fully &s;atisfied by your account of them. I &s;hall be glad <HI>now</HI> to &s;ee the poem upon Sickne&s;s, which you offer to lend me. A few days ago the &s;ub|ject
<PB N="30" REF="34">
might have depre&s;&s;ed my lowered &s;pirits, and have made nervous cordials of no effect. My hand &s;till trembles a little, as perhaps you will perceive, which will make me &s;horten this letter; and Par&s;on Hall's conver&s;ation whil&s;t I write, is another motive to my &s;hortening it; &s;o I ha&s;ten, Sir, to tell you that I am very happy in the thought of &s;eeing you &s;oon at Barrells, and much obliged to Mi&s;s Dolman for her in|tended vi&s;it. Every friend of yours is welcome here; therefore &s;he would be &s;o, had I never &s;een her: but having had the plea&s;ure of enjoy|ing her company at your hou&s;e, I &s;hould have a very bad ta&s;te not to be de&s;irous of enjoying more of it. Here I naturally &s;hould &s;ay, the &s;ooner you come the better; but I will tell you &s;incerely, that I am at pre&s;ent a&s;hamed of my &s;lovenly garden, which cannot be weeded, nor in the lea&s;t &s;pruced up, till my hay is all in; which employs all my &s;ervants, and all the hands I can get this bu&s;y time. Mr. Outing writes me word, that in a fortnight he &s;hall be at Somerviles-A&s;ton, and that a few days after he will come to Barrells; by which time I reckon my hay-making will be at an end, and my garden put into &s;omewhat better order: and as I know he will be greatly plea&s;ed to meet you here, I hope about that time to &s;ee you, and
<PB N="31" REF="35">
that you will not make &s;o &s;hort a &s;tay here as you mention.</P>
<P>Your pen gives me a very clear idea of Mr. Lyttelton's ca&s;tle, and I believe I know the &s;pot on which it is &s;ituated; but the propo&s;al you make of my &s;eeing it in &s;o agreeable a manner as by going to Mr. Dolman's, makes me un|willing to content my&s;elf with viewing it only in your letter.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be ready to contribute to any encou|ragement you &s;hall think fit to give to Mr. Smith's De&s;igns; and am glad Virgil's Grove will have a place among them.</P>
<P>I return thanks for your compliment about my Son, who is as <HI>dear</HI> to me as he is <HI>dutiful</HI>, and, I flatter my&s;elf, <HI>de&s;erving:</HI> he is returned from Italy to Spa, and is going to pay his duty to the King at Hanover. My Daughter is lately married.&mdash;I hope your Brother is perfectly re|covered, and that you will pardon this &s;tupid letter, which I am &s;ure is not fraught with the lea&s;t &s;pirit; but in its lowly way is very &s;incere, particularly when it a&s;&s;ures you of the perfect e&s;teem, with which I am,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my la&s;t letter might po&s;&s;ibly prevent my having the plea&s;ure of your company &s;o &s;oon as you intended to give it me, I take the fir&s;t opportunity of acquainting you, that the ob&s;tacles are removed; for my hay-making is over, and my health is better. As to Mr. Outing's meeting you, indeed I cannot ab&s;o|lutely an&s;wer; but I know he left London la&s;t Monday was &s;even night, with his cou&s;in Wal&s;h, and they were to come to Oxford in the &s;tage|coach, &s;tay there a day, and proceed to Jacky Reynalds's on hor&s;eback; from whence I under|&s;tood Mr. Wal&s;h would go to drink Cheltenham waters, and Mr. Outing would, in a very &s;hort time after his arrival in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, make me a vi&s;it at Barrells; and was much concerned he could not meet you and Mi&s;s Dolman here; for I &s;uppo&s;e he compre|hended you were coming immediately, and his letter was writ the 5th in&s;tant. I expect every day to hear from him, and I imagine he will be here next week; but whether he is or

no, I &s;hall hope to &s;ee you, Sir, with Mi&s;s Dol|man, her brother, or any friend you choo&s;e to bring. If you write to me on Saturday, and direct it to be left with Mr. Williams, Painter, in New-&s;treet, Birmingham, I have de&s;ired him to forward it; and as his brothers live in Henley, he has more frequent opportunities of &s;ending thither than Mr. Ironmonger. He has fini&s;hed my chimney-piece; which he hopes will not be di&s;approved by you, Sir, to whom I owe the idea of it.</P>
<P>I am a&s;hamed to own that I have not yet an|&s;wered Lady Hertford's letter, nor read the books &s;he recommended: in &s;hort, I might as well have been a mole and lived under ground, or a dormou&s;e and &s;lept ince&s;&s;antly, as the in|&s;ignificant animal I have been for &s;ome time. Two or three days indeed I was kept awake by a vi&s;it from Mr. Meredith, who entertained me with the many gay entertainments he had been a partaker of at London la&s;t Spring; but when he was gone, I was left alone with Mon&s;ieur Pantin, whom, I confe&s;s, I have not wit enough to amu&s;e my&s;elf with; &s;o that I &s;eldom let him make his appearance, but when Par&s;on Hall comes; for they &s;hew each other to great advantage.</P>

<P>I Always re&s;pected your man Tom for his hone&s;ty and fidelity to his ma&s;ter; but at pre&s;ent I re&s;pect him for the good <HI>tidings</HI> he <HI>bringeth</HI>, which make my heart full glad. It is plain your thoughts and mine corre&s;pond; for I have been all the la&s;t week con&s;idering which day I &s;hould fix for going to the Lea&s;owes, or whether I &s;hould not fir&s;t de&s;ire your company at Barrells.&mdash;Mr. Meredith came hither la&s;t Tue&s;day, and went for London on Thur&s;day. We talked of your charming &s;ituation; but more of your agreeable company: both which he wi&s;hes to be acquainted with; and I offered to carry him to wait on you, as on Monday next, and &s;aid he might go on from thence to Che&s;hire; which he hearkened to with plea&s;ure, but told me he was obliged to get there by Saturday, and that he intended coming here again next Friday, in his way thither; &s;o would not let me write you word, for fear of di&s;appointing you. I &s;ent however to Mr. Hall (as I don't love to jumble in a po&s;t-chai&s;e alone) to a&s;k him to go with me
<PB N="37" REF="41">
on Monday or Tue&s;day next; but he was po&s;ting away to preach the a&s;&s;ize &s;ermon ye&s;ter|day at Warwick, and from thence to go to Rugby the latter end of this week; where he ex|pects to receive his final an&s;wer about the Living of Harborough; and in ca&s;e he &s;ucceeds, will be obliged to ride about the country &s;till farther; but if not, will return to Henley next Saturday, and wait upon you with me, as he writes me word. In this uncertain &s;tate, confu&s;ed by all the&s;e half engagements, your tru&s;ty '&s;quire found me, and &s;eemed come to my relief, by bringing me word you was ready to make me happy in your company, and Mr. and Mi&s;s Dolman's and your brother's, at my cell. Now the be&s;t way I can think of to decide of this affair is, that I &s;hould go, at all events, to the Lea&s;owes on Monday to dinner; and that ye all return with me, or immediately after me, to Barrells, as be&s;t &s;uits you; by which means I &s;hall have more of your company, and I may attend Mr. Meredith to a place he is &s;o de&s;irous to &s;ee if he can put off his journey to that day; which I am apt to think he may ea&s;ily do, as Birmingham is in his way home: &s;o he will only dine at the Lea&s;owes, where I propo&s;e, with your leave, to take a night's lodging; as you was &s;o kind to de&s;ire: By which means I
<PB N="38" REF="42">
&s;hall have more of your company, and &s;hall &s;ee your improvements more at lei&s;ure; and your woods will afford a different &s;cenery, when they are embrowned by the &s;hade of the evening, or when the moon glimmers through their leaves: whereas I have never yet &s;een them but in full &s;un-&s;hine, and when walking (had it been in any other place) had been a toil. If you do not write me a line to the contrary, by Thur&s;day's po&s;t, you will &s;ee me next Monday, the 7th in|&s;tant, at your <HI>Forme orn&eacute;e:</HI> and I hope to bring you on the 8th, to my <HI>Ferme 'neglig&eacute;e</HI>; for that you will find it. Having had &s;o much com|pany in my hou&s;e, and the hay-harve&s;t having employed my &s;ervants, the gardens were ne|glected ju&s;t when they ought to have been put in order; and the dry time has prevented the new-laid turf from joining; and my pavillion, when almo&s;t fini&s;hed, was pulled down again in part, to add to it a &s;hrine for Venus: &s;o that it is &s;till uncovered; and the ro&s;es, &amp;c. are all faded, and give an ugly a&s;pect to my &s;hrub|bery; which waits your directions to be new modelled: But in this imperfect condition, if it affords ever &s;o little plea&s;ure to Mr. Dolman, it will have done part of what I wi&s;h it to do: and though I cannot treat him &s;o elegantly as I treated you with truffles and Ca&s;&s;adi-bread, he
<PB N="39" REF="43">
will be heartily welcome to the beans and bacon my Farm produces, and to the chee&s;e of my own dairy.&mdash;I do not wonder your neighbours vi&s;it you frequently; but I wi&s;h they do not envy you, and endeavour to &s;py &s;ome fault. I am per|&s;uaded I &s;hall like your &s;mall Gothic building better than their huge one.&mdash;I am proud of having mentioned the carpet pavement. I be|lieve the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et's is not famous enough to have given occa&s;ion to the words &s;poken by the ladies that vi&s;ited yours. I am al&s;o proud of having &s;hewn my approbation of your place, and of the manner of your improv|ing it, even in its infancy; &s;ince it is now uni|ver&s;ally admired by all who have any ju&s;t pre|ten&s;ions to ta&s;te.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have begun my letter with con|dolence upon your late illne&s;s, and congratula|tions upon your recovery; but as it would have done you no good, you will excu&s;e my neglect, and be &s;o ju&s;t as to believe, that, though it is mentioned la&s;t in my letter, my good wi&s;hes for your health and happine&s;s are ever uppermo&s;t in my mind, however <HI>derang&eacute;</HI> the manner of expre&s;&s;ing them in my letters may be: for what they want in form, they have in &s;incerity; which

I am apt to think you e&s;teem better than form. So I &s;hall only call my&s;elf</P>

<P>The clergyman, who has troubled the pre&s;s with his Lamentations over Polyanthos's, and has prefixed my name to his performance, is one Mr. Perks, of Coughton, whom I never &s;aw but twice; and he had never &s;een Barrells when he wrote it, but came to &s;ee it, in order to make his Dedication in prai&s;e of it. But I think he forms his &s;uppo&s;ition of my taking delight in flowers (not from my Shrubbery, but) from the art, with which he &s;ays I have adorned my apartments. Par&s;on Allen, who does not pre|tend to be a poet, has made a Dedication in imitation of the other; but, I think, better.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ju&s;t time to tell you, that I received your mo&s;t agreeable and obliging letter ye&s;terday; and &s;hall be glad of your company and your Brother's, &amp;c. next Wedne&s;|day, being to dine at Mrs. Che&s;ter's on Tue&s;day. &mdash;Outing writes word that if his cou&s;in returns to London, as he intends, next Monday, he will come for two or three days to Barrells; and hopes to meet you and Mi&s;s Dolman.&mdash;A re|port prevails at Henley which would give me great concern, but that your letter being dated la&s;t Sunday makes me think it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be true: yet it &s;hocked me a good deal to hear the many circum&s;tances repeated belonging to this &s;uppo&s;ed fatal accident; which is, that Mr. Dolman was drowned la&s;t Thur&s;day, being a fi&s;hing in Grove Field, near Warwick; and that his corp&s;e was brought to Litchfield on Friday, and on Saturday two gentlemen &s;et out &s;eparate roads for Oxford to get his &s;cholar&s;hip; one of which brought this news to the Swan, and told it to Mr. Hall and Mr. Holyoak, and

another Oxford &s;cholar whom Mr. Hall is ac|quainted with, came the next day to Henley and confirmed the &s;ame, expre&s;&s;ing great con|cern.

How to reconcile all this with your &s;ending me his compliments in your letter on Sunday, &s;ome Oedipus mu&s;t determine.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is well I am an <HI>invalid</HI>; but even <HI>that</HI> I fear will not be an excu&s;e &s;ufficient for my delaying thanks, &s;o greatly due to you, Sir, to Mi&s;s Dolman, and to your Brother, for the friendly vi&s;it you made me at Barrells; which I &s;incerely a&s;&s;ure you gave me both health and plea&s;ure: for I look upon <HI>the&s;e</HI> two as in&s;epa|rable
<PB N="45" REF="49">
companions: and I am certain the <HI>rugged walk</HI> to Ulenhall Chapel (however conducive to <HI>health</HI>, according to the Phy&s;ician, or to <HI>hap|pine&s;s</HI>, according to the Divine) would never have inclined me to undertake it, had not the company I was with &s;moothed the road, and levelled the ruts; for &s;uch was the effect it had at lea&s;t upon my imagination. But the roads are as <HI>rough</HI> as ever, and I as <HI>lazy</HI>; which &s;hews that <HI>we hermits</HI> are to blame, droning away our time in our cells. For my part, I had a fever, and kept my bed ye&s;terday: I am not very &s;trong to-day; but to re&s;tore my &s;trength and health, (at lea&s;t to give me plea&s;ure) I pro|po&s;e to wait on Mi&s;s Dolman at Brome next Monday (the 29th) to breakfa&s;t and dinner; and to return to Barrells after viewing the <HI>Giants</HI> Ca&s;tle at Hagley. I will then deliver to you the books you lent me, as al&s;o the <HI>green</HI> manu|&s;cript which I &s;o much valued my&s;elf upon having &s;tole from your pocket. Nothing could make me relea&s;e it but your promi&s;e in your la&s;t letter of giving it me with Additions. <HI>Tho&s;e</HI> I &s;hall always covet; and amendments I &s;hall never require.</P>
<P>I have not yet been well enough to an&s;wer Lady Hertford's letter; &s;o have not &s;ent her any thing more of yours. Queen Elizabeth
<PB N="46" REF="50">
you know &s;he has; and as <HI>&s;he</HI> plea&s;ed her as well as my&s;elf in her fir&s;t dre&s;s, I have not &s;ent her in the other.</P>
<P>Mr. Outing <HI>(notwith&s;tanding</HI> the &s;yllabubs) arrived here about two days after you left War|wick&s;hire. He tells me nothing about maids or widows; but does not &s;eem very ready to make new &s;yllabubs, nor to forget old friends: but I confe&s;s that his neglecting the opportunity of telling them &s;o, does not &s;et his friend&s;hip off to the be&s;t advantage. Perhaps he leaves tho&s;e marks of it in the dark, to let them appear in the more re&s;plendent manner when he has held out the lantern of truth to enlighten them, as to his late &s;eemingly remi&s;s conduct. And upon this affair he is now I believe employed, having a&s;ked for ink and paper.</P>
<P>I think I &s;aw a locu&s;t on Sunday la&s;t: Mr. Bradley found it in his corn &s;ingly. If it is one, one might call it a <HI>flying gra&s;hopper</HI>; for it is ex|actly like the gra&s;hopper, only two inches and a half long, and has a brown complexion, and &s;ix feet and four wings; and eats leaves.</P>
<P>Smith's De&s;igns would undoubtedly (if well coloured) be delightful objects, as I &s;uppo&s;e them all drawn in per&s;pective: and for the co|louring, you need be in no fear of either error
<PB N="47" REF="51">
or expence, as you can do them &s;o well your|&s;elf.</P>
<P>My niches are as hollow as when you left them. The ma&s;on I have not &s;een; and the in|tended alteration I had almo&s;t forgot, for want of &s;eeing the place. Such indolence is inexcu|&s;able; yet it does not make me in the &s;malle&s;t degree forgetful of what regards my friends, nor of their advice; which I am ever grateful for, and wi&s;h only I had &s;pirits good enough to ha&s;ten the execution of the workmen.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with great plea&s;ure I learn within the&s;e few hours, that Barrells is eight miles nearer to the Lea&s;owes than I have hitherto thought it; and that the deep ruts I had formed an idea of, are levelled down to bowling-greens. <HI>Such</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="52">
is the account my friend John&s;on gives; who &s;erves me with coals; lives at Northfield; is acquainted with <HI>Hales Owen</HI>, the <HI>Grange</HI>, and with the <HI>Lea&s;owes</HI>, where he &s;ays lives one Mr. Shen&s;tone. He, by my de&s;ire, puts my po&s;til|lion into that lucky road to-morrow to carry you this letter; by which I acquaint you of the plea&s;ure I propo&s;e from it: for in ca&s;e it proves as <HI>he</HI> &s;ays; and that you are not otherwi&s;e en|gaged, you will &s;ee me at the Lea&s;owes any day you plea&s;e to name, either of this week or the next after Wedne&s;day. Mr. Outing and Mr. Hall will accompany me: and we propo&s;e going early in the morning and returning at night to Barrells.&mdash;You &s;ee, Sir, what an agree|able place, adorned with ta&s;te, and more agree|able conver&s;ation, &s;ubjects you to: yet you might for this &s;ea&s;on have e&s;caped the trouble of our company, had it not been for your neigh|bour John&s;on's <HI>good report</HI>; who, had he been a divine, might perhaps have conducted more pilgrims to heaven by this favourable account, than others have done by the merit they pro|po&s;e to them, in reward for labouring through thorns, and &s;truggling with dangers; and might by the &s;ame rule have freed you from the inter|ruption our vi&s;it may give to eremitical retire|ment; if, like other more pious divines, he
<PB N="49" REF="53" MS="Y">
had left your roads as rugged and perilous as they appeared to us before he traced them out.</P>
<P>I write a line to Mi&s;s Dolman, (whom I hope to meet at your hou&s;e) and return her Pilking|ton's Memoirs, which entertained me agreeably. I find, upon reading them over, that the per|&s;on &s;o often mentioned and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the letters J. W&mdash;le, is Mr. Wor&s;dale the Painter.</P>

<P>Pardon this &s;crawl, wrote after midnight; and be &s;o kind as either to &s;end my &s;ervant to Broom with my me&s;&s;age to Mi&s;s Dolman, and the book; or el&s;e to take charge of them for her.</P>

<P>YOUR benevolence, Sir, to your friends does not leave them at your gate, but accompanies them home; and, le&s;t it &s;hould not remain in their memory, is refre&s;hed by new marks of it. As &s;uch I look upon your me&s;&s;age and letter to-day; and have the plea&s;ure to a&s;|&s;ure you, in an&s;wer to your kind enquiry, that I am &s;o far from bodily &s;uffering, that I am better in health than I have been for &s;ome time pa&s;t; and my mind is greatly regaled by the ideas your charming &s;ituation and more charming improvements have indulged it with. I mu&s;t in particular commend your la&s;t alteration; for I never &s;aw a more advantageous one than the clew you have given to lead to your wood, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Your apologies in point of lodging, &s;uppo&s;e me to have neglected your invitation, for fea$ of not meeting with &s;o good a one at the Lea|&s;owes as in the ruts of the Port-way, or &s;ome dirty lane nearer home; which might have been our lot, as it was dark. But I hope you will do
<PB N="51" REF="57" MS="Y">
me more ju&s;tice than to &s;uppo&s;e I would have been &s;o unkind to my&s;elf as to have quitted a place where I was &s;o pre&s;&s;ingly invited, and &s;o agreeably entertained, had I not been obliged to return home that night. But le&s;t you &s;hould think this a compliment, I promi&s;e faithfully (and as it is for my own &s;ake, you may believe me) to &s;tay, next time I go to the Lea&s;owes, all that night, and as far of the next day as you &s;hall think rea&s;onable and &s;afe for travelling. This promi&s;e, or rather threat, you may depend upon: &s;o beware.</P>
<P>I was glad of the <HI>honour</HI> of meeting Lord Dudley and his Si&s;ter at your hou&s;e; and hope for <HI>that</HI> of &s;eeing them at mine. The re&s;t of the company which happened to come to you were extremely agreeable; and I regretted no|thing but want of day-light which deprived me of &s;o many plea&s;ures at once.</P>
<P>As to Par&s;on Hall, I never thought there was any offence given him: if there was, <HI>I</HI> gave it fir&s;t; but being uncon&s;cious of it, I never made him an excu&s;e; but, on the contrary, reproached him for leaving my chai&s;e a quarter of a mile from home; where, when I came, I found him very good-humoured, and he lay here. How|ever, when I received your letter this afternoon, I &s;ent it to him to Henley to read: he returned
<PB N="52" REF="58">
it immediately, with the inclo&s;ed an&s;wer; and I believe him &s;o &s;incere, that he never once ima|gined any per&s;on could take any thing that was &s;aid but as a joke: and I confe&s;s my&s;elf not only &s;o <HI>&s;incere</HI>, but al&s;o &s;o <HI>&s;tupid</HI>, that I did not con|ceive it could be &s;uppo&s;ed otherwi&s;e; or that what was &s;aid was capable of admitting of any other interpretation, till your letter reminded me, that perhaps before &s;trangers it might not be proper: but if &s;uch is the ca&s;e, before &s;trangers one mu&s;t &s;ew up one's mouth, and be exceeding bad company, le&s;t they &s;hould imagine one wants common humanity to one's own friend; which would here be the ca&s;e, as I look upon Mr. Hall as mine.</P>
<P>In the hurry ye&s;terday of plea&s;ure and fatigue, I forgot to return thanks for a fine greyhound I received from the Lea&s;owes by my &s;ervant the la&s;t time I &s;ent. He has catched me a hare; and &s;eems of a race to catch many.&mdash;I beg my be&s;t compliments to Mr. Jo&s;eph Shen&s;tone, who&s;e obliging temper is to be liked by all, and is much regarded by me.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e Mi&s;s Dolman is returned to Broom; but hope you will make my compliments to her and her Brother in the mo&s;t friendly manner; and wi&s;h &s;o many miles and rugged ways did not part us. I begin to envy the ants, who are

hid from the world, and the world from them, till the &s;ummer &s;un returns to enliven it. <HI>This</HI> you will &s;ay is a &s;ad pro&s;pect I have propo&s;ed to my view; perhaps more really &s;erious than Mr. Hervey's of the Tombs! But <HI>true</HI> however it is, that winter in the country is too &s;olemn to give plea&s;ure, though it may give awe; and I love it as much as a child does a rigid parent. But to put off the evil day, I hope you will a&s;&s;i&s;t by lengthening out the autumn as long as po&s;|&s;ible, by your company here and your Brother's, and by your agreeable letters when I do not &s;ee you.&mdash;I dare not name the Green Book now, though <HI>precious</HI> to me; for you have paid great intere&s;t for the loan of it, by the &s;ix lines you &s;ent me to-day, which are delightfully pretty; and which Lord Dudley and my&s;elf ought to think our&s;elves honoured by: but yet, the <HI>intere&s;t</HI> paid, the <HI>principal</HI> is &s;till due, and the <HI>Green Book</HI> is &s;till my object. Whatever you write, or de&s;ign, is &s;o; therefore it is &s;aying no more than you have heard me &s;ay before; and which I am hopeful you will believe, knowing that I de&s;erve by my &s;incerity to be e&s;teemed</P>

It would be a good amu&s;ement in the Wizard's Ca&s;tle; for by this means it would give no trouble to bring all the beautiful gardens and palaces of the world to your view, as his chry|&s;tal globe by turning &s;hewed him the various turns of man.

<P>IN the la&s;t letter I wrote you (which I hope you received) I promi&s;ed to &s;end you Dod&s;ley's Mi&s;cellany by Mr. Outing and Mr. Hall the week following; but finding they have not yet fixed a day for their journey, I am re&s;olved to venture &s;ending the books by your faithful po&s;twoman, (to whom Mr. Bradley will deliver them) rather than to wait any longer for me&s;&s;engers who may perhaps never perform their promi&s;e: for the beauties of autumn will &s;oon decay, though they are not decayed yet; the roads grow bad, and the days, which are already &s;hort, will be &s;horter; and Mr. Outing's bu&s;ine&s;s, which obliges him to be in London

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE uncertainty of my receiving an an|&s;wer from you in due time, according to the date, and al&s;o my pre&s;ent uncertainty as to which day of this month I am mo&s;t likely to have the plea&s;ure of your company at Barrells, and, above all, the fear of being by &s;ome ac|cident deprived of it, or by my ab&s;ence &s;eem unde&s;erving of it, are all rea&s;ons which oblige me without the lea&s;t delay to acquaint you, that, before I received your la&s;t welcome letter, I had yielded to Mr. and Mrs. Reynalds's &s;trong invitation to Somervile's-A&s;ton; where, had I refu&s;ed to go, yet Mr. Outing mu&s;t have gone, having part of his wardrobe there (as his fir&s;t vi&s;it from London was to them); as al&s;o, &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s which he &s;ays he mu&s;t go to fini&s;h, even if I &s;hould again be prevented from going where I have been &s;o long expected: and I dare &s;ay
<PB N="64" REF="70">
you would be &s;orry to find him gone from Barrells; and more &s;o, to have a &s;econd time rea&s;on to think his friend&s;hip remi&s;s in its duty. Therefore, Sir, the&s;e con&s;iderations weighed, I determine to &s;end a me&s;&s;enger to the Lea&s;owes to-morrow with this, and my compliments to you and Mr. Jo&s;eph Shen&s;tone; and to ac|quaint you, that our day of march from Bar|rells to A&s;ton is fixed for Friday next, the 18th in&s;tant; and that of our return for the Friday following, the 25th: and we &s;hall depend upon &s;eeing you the fir&s;t moment your bu&s;ine&s;s or inclination permits. How readily would my pen and wi&s;hes fix the 26th, that being the earlie&s;t moment; but you ob&s;erve in your let|ter to Mr. Outing, that fixing days is an en|croachment upon liberty; therefore I am &s;ilent, and &s;ubmit to the time which &s;uits your con|veniency. And as I do not intend to make any more excur&s;ions till &s;pring returns, and do not expect any company here, I fear no interrup|tions from this &s;ide the <HI>Lickee</HI>, (how do you &s;pell it?) and flatter my&s;elf there will be none on the other: then &s;hall I &s;ee you arrive per|haps through &s;now or rain, which will heighten my gratitude, but moderate my joy. The Green Book will add greatly to my plea&s;ure, and your conver&s;ation will make me prefer

winter to my favourite autumn, though I have refu&s;ed that preference to &s;pring: but to &s;ay the truth, no &s;ea&s;on can be di&s;agreeable in com|pany one likes; nor none agreeable with the in&s;ipid or un&s;ociable, the unfriendly, or the un|meaning, the de&s;igning, the tale-bearing, the pedantic, or the ignorant, &amp;c. &amp;c. from all which may the Divine Powers deliver us; and may I &s;oon enjoy the rever&s;e company in my chimney corner! then &s;hall I be agreeably en|tertained; Mr. Outing be ea&s;ed from his fears of not &s;eeing you before he leaves the country; and Mr. Hall be enabled to make his own excu|&s;es to you, and in particular to Mr. Jo&s;eph Shen|&s;tone for not performing his promi&s;e. He &s;eems penitent, and I galled him a little, though with your gentle and kind reproaches, which he felt, notwith&s;tanding at that in&s;tant he was wrapt in ec&s;tacies of joy and admiration; for he had pur|cha&s;ed an incomparable hor&s;e the day before. The beauty of novelty is great with him; but it will be decayed before this month is out, and he will then have the more time to give you marks of his friend&s;hip; which I dare &s;ay is always &s;in|cere, and not tran&s;ient, as his pa&s;&s;ion for his hor&s;e may be.&mdash;Now I have an&s;wered for him,

It is &s;ufficient, that your not coming or writing &s;ooner, was no way owing to your want of friend&s;hip: <HI>that</HI> en&s;ures your pardon; and I find my&s;elf now become the penitent &s;inner, but expect the &s;ame pardon; for I am &s;en&s;ible I was too &s;evere (though meant in raillery) when I reprimanded you for not coming or writing into Warwick&s;hire; whereas I ought to have con&s;idered I was in another county nine or ten days, and that you could not gue&s;s I had left orders to be &s;ent for if you came, or to have your letters brought me if you wrote.&mdash;After my return, indeed, Mr. Outing's expectations of &s;eeing you were rai&s;ed by our not hearing from you; which he attri|buted to your de&s;ign of coming here before his return to London; and his expectations rai&s;ed my hopes; &s;o that the la&s;t &s;ix days (which was the full time he could allow him|&s;elf to &s;ojourn here) &s;eemed &s;o many years to him, and made me think the time the long|er, though I had not equal rea&s;on to grieve at the di&s;appointment, being &s;u&s;tained by hope, whil&s;t he has cau&s;e to de&s;pair perhaps for many months to come.

the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of reference to a third per&s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. Allen was here la&s;t week, but is gone; &s;o that I cannot make your compliments to him now, but I can an&s;wer that he will be glad to make his to you in per&s;on, as he has a great e&s;teem for you. He thinks &s;o well of Mr. Whi&s;tler's Poem, and is &s;o plea&s;ed with mo&s;t of the thoughts, that he wi&s;hes them new dre&s;&s;ed, or rather the whole thing revi&s;ed by &s;ome good poet of age more mature than that gentleman's then was, and imagines it worthy of their care.</P>
<P>Permit me to interrupt what I am &s;aying with a cur&s;e again&s;t crow-pens. If I was to add to the cur&s;es in the Service for A&s;hwedne&s;day, the crows would be loaded with them; or ra|ther, the men who invented putting their quills to this u&s;e, which at pre&s;ent gives me into|lerable fatigue, and will prevent my &s;aying half of what I would &s;ay to you:&mdash;How much more friendly are the gee&s;e! Mine were all retired to, re&s;t before I returned from my de|votions at Henley; and I never once thought or imagined that turkies could produce a quill capable of writing &s;o good a hand as your let|ter is wrote in. Surely the bird you killed for Lord Dudley, and with who&s;e quill you wrote
<PB N="74" REF="80">
to me, mu&s;t have been a phoenix in di&s;gui&s;e! How could we have been both &s;o elegantly fea&s;ted by any common bird! If my turkies carried &s;o much wit in their quills, they &s;hould not live till morning, but &s;hould be &s;acrificed to you. But if, on the contrary, they can only convey <HI>my wit</HI>, let <HI>them</HI> live, and let <HI>me</HI> be &s;ilent for <HI>your</HI> &s;ake.&mdash;Your want of gilt paper was no more to be regarded than your want of a coronet or crown. My want of a pen and ink is really want of common nece&s;&s;aries, bread or water: yet the fact is &s;o, that I can come at neither that will make what I write intelligible. All I can do for you is, to make my letter the &s;horter. But I mu&s;t fir&s;t commend your intended alterations in your hou&s;e, though they prolong the time of your ab&s;ence. The room you de&s;cribe, is of a good dimen&s;ion, as well as elegant: the library will be the &s;ame, and will be a la&s;ting plea&s;ure to you. It is now only in embrio: the improving it to the per|fection you propo&s;e, will be a daily amu&s;e|ment. Your fine pro&s;pects and waters will a&s;&s;i&s;t you in making every thing round it enchant|ing: but if you &s;hould be as &s;en&s;ible of the beauties of the Lea&s;owes as your friends are, they would never be able to get you from it; and as I &s;hould be one of the greate&s;t &s;ufferers,

I will not encourage you to like it too much. Yet I may venture to &s;ay, that I think the building you &s;end me the &s;ketch of, will be a fine ornament to one of your woods, and your urn a very proper and friendly addition to the other. You &s;ay nothing of either of the Sketches, &s;o that I do not know which you have fixed upon: I think tho&s;e I have marked with 2 and 3, are too common a &s;hape, and would do better in a church than a grove; <HI>that</HI> you have wrote the in&s;cription upon, is a better &s;hape in my eye; but I think the top-ornament not very pretty, though better than the flame in the &s;econd. The garland of flowers mends the &s;hape of the third: but I imagine you have fixed on the fir&s;t, and think it will be very hand&s;ome. I do not think the pipe, &amp;c. on the fourth would be ugly if hung by a rib|band to the knot which joins the foliage; but I do not &s;o well like the ba&s;e of the urn: but I &s;peak with great ignorance, and con&s;equently with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which you will &s;ay is not always a con&s;equence of ignorance; but it ought to be &s;o, and is &s;o where the ignorant are not by nature fools: <HI>&agrave; propos</HI> to which, permit me to &s;ay, that I mu&s;t be a great one, if I think my|&s;elf capable of critici&s;ing upon your writings of any &s;ort.&mdash;The elegies you have the goodne&s;s to

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Barrells, <DATE>January 4th, 1748-9, Nine at Night.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your letter of the 30th ult. this evening, in my bed; to which I was confined by a nervous fever. I could not even read it; for I had not &s;een day-light &s;ince the &s;un &s;et, the evening before; which tedious time was not once indulged with &s;weet repo&s;e. I am now up, and think it &s;hould be morning; but as yet, there appears to me as much irregularity in time as there is in my pul&s;e, and as you are &s;ure to find in my letter; e&s;pecially as it is wrote under the&s;e circum&s;tances. I imagined I could not hold a pen, and I find it only po&s;&s;ible by in|tervals. I have however remembered the late rough notes of my croaking crow enough to reject the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his quill, and have recour&s;e to the goo&s;e to return the compliments you make me, imagining the quill of that bird would fa|vour me as it did you: but I am di&s;appointed; &s;he is &s;till &s;tupid; and her &s;i&s;ter, who &s;erved you &s;o well, mu&s;t have been bred at Paris, if
<PB N="79" REF="85">
one judges by her politene&s;s: and if you have ever employed her in the Poetical Pieces you have &s;ent me, I &s;hall think &s;he has &s;tudied at Parna&s;&s;us.&mdash;Why mu&s;t the &s;illy look of the goo&s;e entitle her to be the emblem of nothing but &s;tupidity, when the more &s;illy gravity of the owl allows him to be the emblem of wi&s;|dom? Henceforward I &s;hall prefer gee&s;e to all other of the feathered kind: at lea&s;t, the gee&s;e of the Lea&s;owes.</P>
<P>I am glad your parlour wants no more to fini&s;h it than &s;tucco. Mr. Wright of Worce&s;|ter &s;tucco'd my Summer-hou&s;e; which is well done, as to workman&s;hip. Where more ele|gance is required, he employs an Italian under him. They did the new work at Warwick Ca&s;tle, at the Priory, and the in&s;ide of the Tem|ple at Lord Archer's.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith's letter to you, Sir, is exceeding polite; and I rejoice that he looks upon the Lea&s;owes in the light that place appears to me: my vanity is indulged by it, as is my con&s;tant de&s;ire to perform what is agreeable to you, &s;ince he &s;eems &s;o well plea&s;ed that the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et's name &s;hould be added to his li&s;t, and that I have had the good fortune to pro|cure it. Her Grace has been very ill, and is far from being recovered, though &s;he did me the
<PB N="80" REF="86">
honour to write me a compliment of condo|lence upon the death of Lord St. John, my Brother (at Naples) which &s;he &s;ays &s;he did, <HI>knowing that I ever write benefits on a rock, but injuries on &s;and</HI>. I have, indeed, in this very in&s;tance, felt that &s;he does me ju&s;tice; for the news of his death, which my Brother Boling|broke wrote la&s;t Monday &s;evennight, was the fir&s;t cau&s;e of my di&s;order.&mdash;I have been di&s;abled from reading over your Elegies with the atten|tion <HI>I</HI> could wi&s;h and <HI>they</HI> do merit; but I am well per&s;uaded, they will plea&s;e better judges, as they do me; and that they want but little of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e judges to make them as perfect as your&s;elf and your friends can de|&s;ire. I confe&s;s, the length of the Preface gave me &s;ome pain, le&s;t the impatience of many rea|ders might make them lay down the book before they got to what <HI>that</HI> is meant to intro|duce them to: and in &s;ome per&s;ons it may rai&s;e &s;cruples as to the propriety of the Elegies, which they would not ever have thought of objecting to, as it is a kind of di&s;&s;ertation upon that &s;pecies of poetry, and might perhaps (if nece&s;&s;ary at all) be better printed as &s;uch after the Elegies. The many tedious and bad pre|faces that have fatigued the world, may have perhaps cau&s;ed a di&s;like to &s;uch introductions,
<PB N="81" REF="87">
however perfect they may be, and made them be condemned by numbering the pages, rather than by reading them; and whether they are right or wrong in doing &s;o, I believe all writers are under a &s;ort of nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to the fa&s;hion of the times, or of renouncing ap|plau&s;e, even when they be&s;t de&s;erve it: and that <HI>that</HI> &s;hould be your ca&s;e, who de&s;erve &s;o much, would be a concern to all your friends, and to none more than to me. I confe&s;s, I was doubtful if I ought to object to this preface to your&s;elf, though I thought as I now write about it; but was diffident of my judgment, till you mentioned an intention of curtailing it at lea&s;t. The &s;eventh Elegy I like as well as any I have had time to look over, and was the more inclined to read it, as you had Lord Beau|champ in view in the latter part; but I am apt to think the Duche&s;s would rather be <HI>hurt</HI> than <HI>plea&s;ed</HI> at the application of it, becau&s;e the late Duke was &s;o barbarous as to &s;ay that &s;he &s;ent her <HI>&s;on</HI> over to kill him.&mdash;<Q>Might not the intention and the &s;en&s;e of the Elegy end as properly at the fourteenth &s;tanza &startq;the beauties &endq;of Britannia's mind?"</Q> Perhaps I talk very fooli&s;hly; for my &s;mall genius (if ever I had any) is grown ru&s;ty for want of opportunities of u&s;ing, and of brightening it, by conver&s;ation:
<PB N="82" REF="88">
and my imagination has been robbed of every &s;park of fire by the fever, to kindle a flame in my blood and &s;corch my body, whil&s;t my thoughts freeze: yet it has left in my heart enough warmth to keep friend&s;hip alive as long as I exi&s;t.

<P>Saturday.</P>
<P>P. S. Mr. John Reynalds has lain here one night &s;ince you wrote to me; and &s;ays he will fly from A&s;ton to Barrells at your call. Mr. Hall will have equal plea&s;ure in &s;eeing you, and le&s;s way to come. Mr. Allen has been im|mured in minced pies, (as I &s;uppo&s;e) and has devoutly paid his homage to <HI>his</HI> god <HI>Whi&s;t</HI> &s;o long, that his devotion (like that of other bi|gots) has made him forget his friends, and every worldly duty, beyond the limits of his pari&s;h: &s;o that I have not &s;een him, but am per&s;uaded he is not yet &s;o <HI>hardened</HI> in his <HI>ido|latry</HI>,

but he will be recalled the moment you come to convert him; which I the more rea|dily an&s;wer for, as the twelve days are now over.</P>
<P>You are to remark, that though my letter was wrote on the 4th in&s;tant, my Po&s;t&s;cript is not wrote till the 7th at night: and I have the plea&s;ure to tell you, I am recovered from my indi&s;po&s;ition, and wait impatiently for your company, and will keep the Elegies &s;afe till then.</P>
<P>You had no need to make an excu&s;e for <HI>group|ing</HI> many &s;ubjects in the la&s;t &s;hort page of your letter; for a good ma&s;ter knows how to put every object in its mo&s;t advantageous light, though they were ever &s;o numerous, and to place them &s;o, that the more clo&s;ely connected, the more plea&s;ing the groupe, and the more is the judgment of the arti&s;t admired, who with his pencil cannot exceed your quill.</P>

<P>IT is true, Sir, <HI>life is chequered</HI>, and with great exactne&s;s too. I have often thought it, and now experience it: for your letter was delivered to me la&s;t Friday at noon, and gave me exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure; and that &s;ame evening I was &s;eized with exqui&s;ite pain in my right foot, which for three days continued raging, and would make me rave, if I did not think it Ju&s;tice Divine: for to me to be denied the power to <HI>walk</HI>, is as great a puni&s;hment as it is to &s;ome (Outing for in&s;tance) to be obliged to <HI>ride</HI>. Many perhaps in my ca&s;e would vainly <HI>blame the Powers above</HI>; but I allow their <HI>di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> to be ju&s;t: for a more mo|derate pain would not have been adequate to the plea&s;ure your letter, and the Ver&s;es inclo&s;ed, afforded me.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR great punctuality in returning the books has prevented my &s;ending a &s;er|vant to thank you for your vi&s;it; which I may do with infinitely more ju&s;tice than you can thank me for my <HI>reception</HI>, which was far from de&s;erving to have the word <HI>elegant</HI> joined to it: the word <HI>hearty</HI> is the utmo&s;t it could claim, and <HI>that</HI> I may venture to in&s;ure for as long as my life la&s;ts; for till <HI>that</HI> cea&s;es, my &s;incerity will not cea&s;e; and my e&s;teem for you, Sir, in particular, I am certain never will. But I always wi&s;h to enliven that <HI>heavy</HI> idea which the word <HI>hearty</HI> conveys, by &s;ome entertainment agreeable to your ta&s;te, when|ever
<PB N="88" REF="94">
ever you favour me with a vi&s;it: but, alas! I have had as many di&s;appointments in my wi&s;hes as any per&s;on ever had, during &s;everal years of my life, I al&s;o find one in this la&s;t de&s;ire; for the weather, or my &s;pirits, or both, are generally depre&s;&s;ed when I wi&s;h them gaye&s;t; and my &s;olitude is commonly more &s;trict when I wi&s;h it to be varied, by the arrival of &s;ome merry companion or other to entertain me and my friends: yet I might live at lea&s;t five hundred years in this place before one quarter of the incidents happened which are related in any one of the &s;ix volumes of Tom Jones. I have not yet read the two la&s;t; but I think as you do, that no one character yet is near &s;o &s;triking as Adams's in the author's other com|po&s;ition, and the plan &s;eems far-fetched; but in the adventures that happen, I think he pro|duces per&s;onages but too like tho&s;e one meets with in the world; and even among tho&s;e people to whom he gives good characters, he &s;hews them as in a concave gla&s;s, which di&s;|covers blemi&s;hes that would not have ap|peared to the common eye, and may make every mode&s;t reader fear to look in &s;uch a gla&s;s, as &s;ome do who have been beauties, and would choo&s;e to fancy them&s;elves &s;o &s;till. The Beauty her&s;elf might &s;hun it equally; for
<PB N="89" REF="95" MS="Y">
that &s;ort of gla&s;s would not flatter, and defects would appear, as there is no perfection in us mortals.&mdash;If Mr. Fielding and Mr. Hogarth could abate the vanity of the world by &s;hew|ing its faults &s;o plainly, they would do more than the greate&s;t divines have yet been capable of: But human nature will &s;till be the &s;ame, and would, I am afraid, furni&s;h them, if they lived till the world ended, with &s;uch imperfect objects to repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I thank you, Sir, for Irene, and as much for giving me your opinion, which I look upon as a &s;ure guide with which I may travel through it with &s;afety and profit. I hear it is not much liked at London; but though the Pub|lic are far from being in general unju&s;t judges, they are apt to condemn or commend too &s;ud|denly; and, if one thing di&s;plea&s;es, to be di&s;|plea&s;ed with the whole; and the &s;ame, when one thing happens to plea&s;e; their prai&s;e and their condemnation being in extremes: and they often damn a play for one &s;ingle fault, or extol it for a &s;ingle beauty.</P>
<P>I &s;end you a book for your bookbinder's pattern: but as to your wax, you are (for the fir&s;t time in your life) a little <HI>ungenerous</HI> in challenging me to match its colour; you might as well bid me match the <HI>vermeille of the ro&s;e</HI>,

If you cea&s;ed ab&s;olutely to add to it, it would &s;till be new; Nature would furni&s;h it with never-dying charms; but I know you cannot help a&s;&s;i&s;ting it, &s;o that I &s;hall di&s;|cover &s;ome unconfe&s;&s;ed beauty which you will &s;eem careful to hide, when I next pay my annual vi&s;it and acknowledgments to you.&mdash;If any thing is done here, it will be owing to the advice you are &s;o kind to give me.&mdash;I doubt whether I rightly under&s;tand in what manner you would have <HI>the Hermitage become part of the &s;hrubbery, by means of about three yards of &s;hrubbery on the out&s;ide of my lime-walk?</HI> I &s;hould be glad to make this connection; but will it not lay my garden open to the field through which pa&s;&s;es a foot-road to Henley? and yet, accor|ding to your advice, might I not plant that &s;traight walk, which is now gravelled, full of &s;hrubs, and not let it lead to the Hermitage, but return in a &s;erpentine manner one of my crooked &s;and-walks beyond the Ha! Ha! &s;o as to meet the walk which is bordered by &s;ervice-trees and fenced with rails, and does lead in a curve to the Hermitage; in which walk might

al&s;o be &s;hrubs and a &s;erpentine &s;and-pa&s;&s;age? This could be done, but I que&s;tion if it is your meaning. The cau&s;e of my doubt is your &s;aying <HI>behind</HI> the Lime-walk; whereas I have no limes but from the Phea&s;ant Yards to the White Gate that leads to the Field; and <HI>behind</HI> tho&s;e limes is only the lane which is much below the garden, and is lately planted with abeles: the walk in the field which immediately leads to the Shrubbery is planted with <HI>&s;ervice-trees</HI>. Set me right when I hear from you next.&mdash;I cannot venture to put up my pavillion this &s;um|mer, unle&s;s you extend your kindne&s;s &s;o far as to come over in the warm &s;ea&s;on for a few days, to in&s;truct me and my workmen; for I am per&s;uaded they will err, though Mr. Hands the Joiner will perform his part well, in laying out the ground as he has done in the wood|work; but the Ma&s;ons I &s;hall never manage, nor be able even to in&s;truct; and as to the planting round, I think to defer that till the latter &s;ea&s;on, but in the mean time make the &s;hort Ha!

<P>P. S. As to Mr. Hall's affair, he had a laudable ambition to have you write an in|&s;cription to perpetuate his Father's memory. You &s;aid you knew him &s;o little, you de&s;ired I would give you &s;ome hints to guide you; but I knew him not at all, nor ever &s;aw him in my life. The general character I have heard, was that of an hone&s;t man, a faithful &s;teward, and
<PB N="93" REF="99">
withal knowing; &s;o that his advice was often a&s;ked and followed with &s;ucce&s;s; and he was careful of his family and prudent. More I know not; but once read a letter of his writ|ing upon an accidental affair, which was a little intricate, and ob&s;erved in it much pru|dence, judgment, calmne&s;s, yet not unfeeling calmne&s;s, aud much delicacy of &s;entiment; from which letter I judged the better of his heart and head; yet it was written in the evening of his life, and when a private misfortune had ruffled him and lowered his &s;pirits. Since that, I have only heard that he was lamented by many; and you know how much his &s;on was affected with it; and his zeal and affection for his father makes him wi&s;h more &s;hould be &s;aid of him than barely that he lived and died, and with &s;omething more elegance than the common form of what the &s;exton writes on a grave|&s;tone; but he does not de&s;ire flattery or flou|ri&s;hes. According to this, and to obey your commands, I have wrote down a kind of &s;peci|men, which I beg you to peru&s;e, and reject or alter, or amend, as you &s;hall &s;ee proper. As to the fir&s;t line, I am dubious if I &s;hould have it or not to begin, "Here lie," &amp;c. which may be too common and dry; and yet the other may for
<PB N="94" REF="100">
what I know appear too flouri&s;hing. If it was to be &s;et up in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, I think I &s;hould venture it; but to the readers in Tan|worth Church-yard, perhaps it will not appear that the Reverence here meant is only as to an hone&s;t man.</P>
<P>I can only add my excu&s;es for pretending to put my hints into any method, which I &s;hould have left to you; but I con&s;idered the Green Book might be at a &s;tand, whil&s;t your thoughts were employed on this Epitaph.&mdash;Thus &s;elf-love works even] on the mo&s;t <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI>, which I thought <HI>I</HI> was; but find my&s;elf mi&s;taken when intere&s;t points to me a method of ob|taining any of your Works; which in this ca&s;e I do at the expence of my friend Mr. Hall, who will have me, in&s;tead of you, to plan his father's monument; and I am quite unequal to the ta&s;k. Pray burn it or mend it; and for his &s;ake write another, or add a few lines to this.</P>
<P>Pray write an an&s;wer for Thur&s;day next.&mdash; Pity my hurry, and excu&s;e my &s;crawl.&mdash;Com|pliments to your Brother.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE no more than time to let you know that I had your book fir&s;t and your letter after, very &s;afe; and to thank you for your little &s;ketch of alterations in my Shrubbery. In order to follow it, I have begun by taking down the &s;tyles, that no foot-road may prevent the execution of what we propo&s;e; and am ungravelling the lime-walk and laying mold on it; which is the whole that can be done till the planting &s;ea&s;on. In the mean time, I have fini&s;hed my lower garden, by turning the &s;even gra&s;s-plats that were in the &s;hape of Lord Mayor's Cu&s;tards, into one large one; and have widened the gravel-walk round from five feet and a half to twelve feet and a half broad. As to the court, the palli&s;ades are removed, the end-walls built, the turf taken away, the &s;lopes made more gentle, the pillars removed to the extremities of the palli&s;ades, and the &s;un-dial is &s;et in the middle, and the court levelled, rai&s;ed, and gravelled; the two gates are mak|ing. The upper garden is ungravelled, and
<PB N="96" REF="102">
is making into a bowling-green; the pavillion will be &s;et up next, and the white pales taken away from the wall-&s;ide of the &s;table-court to enlarge that in autumn: the way to the Cop|pice will be altered according to your direc|tions; and I hope then you will be &s;o kind as to a&s;&s;i&s;t me; for it is impo&s;&s;ible for you at a di&s;tance to judge &s;o well as on the place.&mdash;I do not know if you would have the little gates left or no at each end of the Service Walk, though they are to be hid with &s;hrubs. I pro|po&s;e coming into the Coppice from the Service-Walk at the farther end between the Chairs that overlook the Pit, and the farther corner of the Wood beyond what an&s;wers to the top of the Hermitage Pit.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h for Mr. Hall's &s;ake you would make a new Epitaph; for mine is &s;carcely worth your retouching. There is one line in par|ticular I do not like: I think it is,
<Q>"As a friendly Coun&s;ellor he gain'd Affection."</Q>
The word <HI>E&s;teem</HI> I believe is not u&s;ed in the whole; though I really forget: but in &s;hort, I like none of that line; and very little of any part of the thing.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR approbation rewards amply the pains I have taken lately in following my workmen, and adds a reli&s;h to the plea&s;ure I take in endeavouring to improve the environs of my cottage. My pavilion is fini&s;hed all to tiling and flooring. I believe I &s;hall be obliged to pen it in with pales to keep off bea&s;ts of all kinds; tho&s;e in human &s;hape chiefly: but the fence will be hid in time with a hedge, and the building &s;haded behind with trees, and on the &s;ides by &s;hrubs. The Ha! Ha! is digging.&mdash;The court has been honoured with Mrs. Kendall's coach and fix, which found room &s;ufficient.
<PB N="98" REF="104">
The bowling-green begins to look tolerably green &s;ince this late rain, which I hope will join the turfs perfectly. The Abele Walk, and that which was gravel, will be filled in the planting &s;ea&s;on, and the Serpentines altered to lead to the Coppice; but the manner of it I &s;hall leave to your direction, hoping to &s;ee you long before that time here, e&s;pecially as Mr. Dolman does me the favour to propo&s;e making me a vi&s;it whil&s;t my Shrubbery is in beauty; which ought to be now: but it is &s;till winter here! It is true, there are various &s;hrubs well blown, but it is &s;o cold and wet, one cannot walk to &s;ee them; and on the dry days the winds are &s;o high, that it is equally di&s;agreeable, and the flowers droop towards the ground when &s;carcely full blown.&mdash;You &s;eem de&s;tined never to &s;ee the embroidery Nature be&s;tows upon my Cop|pice in Spring; where we had even this year great variety of cow&s;lips, primro&s;es, ragged-robins, wild hyacinths both white and blue, violets, &amp;c. &amp;c. In the Shrubbery, I think the fine&s;t ornament is the large bu&s;hes of Whit&s;un-ro&s;es, which are &s;till in blow, and give one an idea of &s;now-balls this cold weather. The lilac is already over, and has given place to the &s;yringa; of which I have enough to per|fume the place with the help of the &s;weet-briar;
<PB N="99" REF="105">
and &s;everal of my ro&s;es are in blow. If this and the next week &s;hould prove more like &s;ummer than the la&s;t, I &s;hall wi&s;h you and Mr. Dolman would come.&mdash;Mrs. Reynalds from Glouce&s;ter&s;hire is now with me, and de&s;ires her compliments to you, and will be glad to &s;ee you here. Her hu&s;band is to come on Tue&s;day to &s;tay here the re&s;t of this week. She will &s;tay here during the next week al&s;o; but the week after that, I expect Mrs. Meredith from Lon|don; and how many &s;he may bring with her I cannot tell.&mdash;Outing will either be at Jacky Reynalds's next week, and come here at your call; or el&s;e he will come here with Mrs. Me|redith for a few days, and go from hence to Jacky Reynalds's, where he will be all &s;ummer, except when he is here.&mdash;Par&s;on Allen is well, and will meet you at any time.&mdash;Mr. Hall is happy in the hopes you give of touching the Epitaph; and I am proud that you think it worth your attention enough to mend &s;ome parts of it.&mdash;I am glad your book&s;eller has improved upon mine. In France, when they gild the edges, (which they do better than us) they marble that gilding with faint colours, which looks very pretty.&mdash;Tho&s;e per&s;ons who cannot find plea&s;ure in trifles, are generally wi&s;e in their own opinions, and fools in the
<PB N="100" REF="106">
opinion of the wi&s;e, as they neglect the oppor|tunities of amu&s;ement, without which the rugged road of life would be in&s;upportably tedious. I think the French are the be&s;t philo&s;ophers, who make the mo&s;t they can of the plea&s;ures, and the lea&s;t they can of the pains of life; and are ever &s;trewing flowers among the thorns all mortals are obliged to walk through; whereas, by much reflection, the Engli&s;h contrive to &s;ee and feel the thorns double, and never &s;ee the flowers at all, but to de&s;pi&s;e them; expect|ing their happine&s;s from things more &s;olid and durable, as they imagine: but how &s;eldom do they find them! One meets indeed with di&s;ap|pointments in trifles; but they are ea&s;ier borne: yet I confe&s;s I was much concerned la&s;t week at the di&s;a&s;ter which befel my poultry, and found my&s;elf puni&s;hed for my pre&s;umption in daring all my neighbours to produce &s;uch fine turkies as mine, of which I had thirty-&s;even, and &s;ix of them were fit to eat; whereas a pole|cat fetched away twenty in one night, and eight at three in the afternoon next day, and &s;ucked the eggs of the turkies, ducks, and chickens, and (what vexed me more upon your account) of the Guinea Hens.</P>
<P>Mr. Hall tells me that Lord Archer a&s;ked him at London, ten days ago, (though he was
<PB N="101" REF="107">
but an hour with him) what you and I thought of his obeli&s;k?&mdash;My bricklayer promi&s;es to alter the Niches this week. My &s;tone-ma&s;on mi&s;took the breadth of the two &s;teps up to the pavilion exactly half, &s;o that I have been obliged to have them pieced, which is ugly.&mdash; Mr. Williams has darkened the ground of the chimney-piece, but cannot alter the &s;hades without new doing the whole.&mdash;I keep Lang|ley's Book till you come to pick out &s;ome &s;er|pentine-walks. I wi&s;h his ideas had been more confined, or my territories le&s;s &s;o. Is it not the &s;ame Langley who publi&s;hed very pretty De&s;igns for Pavement? Mr. Bel&s;on got &s;ome executed with a &s;hade of black, white, and brown &s;mall pebbles.&mdash;The Duche&s;s of Somer|&s;et has a floor to a pavilion in all coloured &s;mall pebbles, placed &s;o as to look like a Per|&s;ian carpet.&mdash;Somebody in Hamp&s;hire has a dead fawn or deer repre&s;ented in pebbles at the door of a grotto in a park; but Langley's are only regular geometrical figures.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I OUGHT to have thanked you &s;ooner for yours, of the 3d, which, as I &s;uppo&s;e, cro&s;&s;ed mine upon the road: but in mine I told you I hoped for your an&s;wer, by word of mouth, to view my Shrubbery with Mr. Dol|man; after which en&s;ued the mo&s;t &s;tormy weather I ever knew, which de&s;troyed all my <HI>Summer</HI> &s;chemes, and left me no comfort but the hopes of converting you to my opinion of giving to <HI>Autumn</HI> the preference over Summer. &mdash;As to <HI>Spring</HI>, the beauties of it are entirely bani&s;hed our hemi&s;phere; and you will be obliged to owe to my favourite &s;ea&s;on every ray of fun un&s;haded by a cloud, or impending &s;hower, that you have enjoyed this &s;ea&s;on. That is al&s;o a &s;ea&s;on which gives me one annual
<PB N="103" REF="109">
day of plea&s;ure at lea&s;t, as it invites me to the Lea&s;owes, or rather, as I naturally point to it, and you are &s;o kind to receive me, and give the Nereids (your Maids of Honour) orders to do it in the mo&s;t elegant manner; and no com|mands were ever better obeyed. I have no &s;uch &s;ervants as tho&s;e aquatic nymphs; and even my terre&s;trial &s;laves &s;corn to obey me: nay, I fear I am not even heard by the a&euml;rial beings, &s;ince they &s;o &s;eldom favour me with a &s;mile. The rains have made my ro&s;es droop before their time; but &s;everal &s;orts have made their appearance, and have died in their prime: others are coming on; but I fear my Shrub|bery mu&s;t lo&s;e more than it is po&s;&s;ible to gain by the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on, however fine the wea|ther may be.</P>
<P>I have been obliged to put off the vi&s;it de|&s;igned me by Mrs. Meredith and two of her daughters next week, and our friend Outing with them, becau&s;e I expect my own daugh|ter and Mr. Wymonde&s;old (her hu&s;band), and do not know but their attendants may be nu|merous; and my hou&s;e is not adapted to re|ceive numbers of people. It is true, one might be &s;uppo&s;ed to make free with a daughter; but my ca&s;e is peculiar. She is now nineteen years old, and I never lay under the &s;ame roof with
<PB N="104" REF="110">
her &s;ince &s;he was only &s;ix; and her hu&s;band I never &s;aw in my life, and have only heard that he is an exceeding good-natured man, and have &s;een that he writes very &s;en&s;ible let|ters to me; but further of his character I do not know. He is u&s;ed to very fine &s;eats, &amp;c. of his father's, and here he will meet a cottage in compari&s;on. What &s;tay they make I know not; but will acquaint you when I know; hoping then for your company, Mr. Dolman's, and Outing's.&mdash;Mrs. Reynalds &s;pent a fort-night with me, and flattered her&s;elf you would come at the &s;ame time. <HI>Jacky</HI> was part of that time here.</P>
<P>I had a letter la&s;t po&s;t from the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et, which being le&s;s than u&s;ual in the rural &s;tyle, I &s;hould not &s;end you, but that I think you will like the de&s;ign &s;he men|tions of a &s;tove in the Chapel; &s;o I &s;end her letter, which you will return.&mdash;Twenty or thirty thou&s;and pounds laid out at Northum|berland Hou&s;e, will be a kind of Roman va|nity, and contribute to the beauty of that part of the city of London, and to the conveniency of the populace in particular, if the Strand is widened.</P>
<P>I &s;aw to-day in the London Evening Po&s;t a letter which reflects upon my Brother B&mdash;&mdash;ke,
<PB N="105" REF="111" MS="Y">
in regard to Mr. P&mdash;pe's treachery to him; in which the blame &s;eems to be thrown from him upon my Brother. I have not yet &s;een any one thing more that has been publi&s;hed concerning it, except a Preface in a Magazine in his favour, the truth of which I could atte&s;t; and have often wondered he could &s;o long &s;tifle the abominable u&s;age he met with from P&mdash;pe in printing his Work, which he had intru&s;ted to him to review, intending that it &s;hould not be publi&s;hed till after his own death. The letters between P&mdash;pe and the Printer, bargaining for the price, were found by Lord Marchmont, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was, by P&mdash;pe's la&s;t <HI>Will</HI>, to look over his papers jointly with Lord Bol&mdash;ke: but as to the &s;ubject of the book, I know nothing of it; nor is that to the purpo&s;e, as to P&mdash;pe's ba&s;ene&s;s to the be&s;t of friends; without whom he had never &s;hone in the E&s;&s;ay on Man.</P>
<P>I like extremely your Weekly Ver&s;es, and &s;hould value greatly a collection of them. Pray favour me once a week with the lines of the day.&mdash;As to the pre&s;ervation of your flowers, I fear tho&s;e you &s;ent me will not keep the peo|ple that read them from gathering as many as u&s;ual, unle&s;s it &s;hould make them dread the re&s;entment of Fairies and <HI>Hobgoblins</HI>, which
<PB N="106" REF="112">
undoubtedly they have formed a perfect notion of, though your rea&s;oning and your lines will not be under&s;tood by them; but if you once per&s;uade them you can conjure up &s;pirits by your pen, I think you may be &s;ecure in your grott from all intruders, and &s;ee your Shrub|bery pro&s;per unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P>Pardon me for differing with you in opinion. You are not the idle man of the creation. You may be bu&s;ied to the benefit of &s;ociety without &s;tirring from your &s;eat, as much as the mi&s;|chievous man with &s;eeming idlene&s;s may be bu&s;ied in the de&s;truction of it. You give in|nocent plea&s;ure to your&s;elf, and in&s;truction as well as plea&s;ure to others, by the amu&s;e|ments you follow. Your pen, your pencil, your ta&s;te, and your &s;incere unartful conduct in life (which are the things that make you appear idle) give &s;uch an example, as it were to be wi&s;hed might be more generally followed&mdash;few have the capacity, fewer have the hone&s;ty to &s;pend their time &s;o u&s;efully, as well as un|blameably.</P>
<P>Your little Gothic Bench I admire. I hope you will execute it at the low price you men|tion, with your own timber; and properly placed, it will be a far more perfect thing than
<PB N="107" REF="113">
our famous re&s;torer of the Gothic &s;tyle in building (Mr. Miller) has yet given us.</P>
<P>I am to dine at Lord Archer's next Tue&s;|day, when I &s;hall &s;ee the Obeli&s;k, and be a better judge how it appears from the &s;aloon it is &s;een from: Mr. Hall, you know, thinks it appears from thence too taper. Talking of Mr. Hall, I mu&s;t tell you that he de&s;ires his be&s;t compliments, be&s;t thanks, &amp;c. &amp;c. and acknowledges he ought to have wrote to you, and would do it now, but he has been, and &s;till is, very much out of order. He rode in one fortnight &s;even or eight hundred miles; to Bath one day; to London two days after; lay there but one night, and away to Rugby; upon &s;everal Ro&s;inantes who plunged him in the waters or on the &s;harp &s;tones: his view was a good living: he was the ninth compe|titor, and &s;ince that has two more that follow him in their hopes or pretences. I do not find it is decided who &s;hall have it; but one thing is certain, that riding &s;o hard, and in bad roads and bad weather, heated his blood, threw him into a high fever, and he is now moving about in a more limited &s;phere, but clogged with half a fever at lea&s;t. In this con|dition he was unable to con&s;ider of the lines you were &s;o kind to &s;end; but ju&s;t read the
<PB N="108" REF="114">
three Epitaphs over, commended in general, and was thankful for your kind attention, then retired to his phy&s;ic, &amp;c. hoping to regain more equal &s;pirits than his are at pre&s;ent, and a more <HI>&s;teady</HI> pul&s;e, which I tell him may make his head more <HI>&s;teady</HI>; and he hopes as much, that he may be able to talk over this little affair with you, Sir, and me at Bar|rells. If his pur&s;uit after <HI>tra&s;h</HI> (which he him&s;elf de&s;pi&s;es) &s;hould cau&s;e him very ill health, how might you hug your&s;elf in your idlene&s;s!&mdash;But to return to his Father's Epi|taph, (though I think it would be our be&s;t way to make his fir&s;t) I am per&s;uaded I have wrote what wants much amendment; and &s;hews your <HI>he&s;itations</HI> (as you politely call them) to be very ju&s;t. As to the &s;econd line, I believe Mr. John Hall may afford a better cadence; but I rather thought the &s;imple name (as you do) more elegant; and I find my Brother Bolingbroke's Epitaph for Daniel Pul|teney is the &s;ame in that particular, there being neither <HI>Mr.</HI> nor <HI>E&s;quire</HI>. In the &s;ame Epitaph is al&s;o
<Q><L>"The Lo&s;s of &s;o much Private Virtue</L>
<L>"Is a Public Calamity."</L></Q>
Your word <HI>Exten&s;ive</HI>, &s;ub&s;tituted in the place
<PB N="109" REF="115">
of <HI>Large</HI>, is certainly better. I believe the jingle of <HI>Large</HI> and <HI>Small</HI> caught me; and I al&s;o believe <HI>"renders his death"</HI> would be better: but whether &s;o much exactne&s;s in grammar is expected in this kind of writing as in plain pro&s;e, you are the be&s;t judge. The word <HI>Example</HI>, in the 13th line, was <HI>Experience</HI> in the copy I kept at home, and was a &s;lip of my pen in tran&s;cribing. <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI> may not be altogether proper to be contra-di&s;tingui&s;hed; but I do not know how to mend it to plea&s;e me: <HI>Temper</HI> is not more to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from Nature; and in &s;hort, the&s;e three lines puzzle me. <HI>Diffu&s;ed</HI> may be put to advantage, I think, (as you ob&s;erve) in&s;tead of <HI>Di&s;per&s;ed</HI>, in the fourteenth line. <HI>Skill</HI> and <HI>Prudence</HI>, as you &s;ay, may be under|&s;tood as not enough oppo&s;ite, though I think they are a good deal &s;o:&mdash;might not one &s;ay
<Q>"Skill equal to his di&s;intere&s;ted Fidelity."</Q>
In the ninteenth line, <HI>E&s;teem</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Re&s;pect</HI>, we both agree in. I do not well know as to the doubt you make, whether they are peculiar enough to each, but am again at a &s;tand for words to change tho&s;e for. As to the twen|tieth, twenty-fir&s;t, and twenty-&s;econd lines, Mr. Hall de&s;ired me, &s;oon after I &s;ent you the
<PB N="110" REF="116">
copy, to leave them out entirely. I &s;hould choo&s;e to leave out, as you ob&s;erve, <HI>"The Rich ble&s;s'd:"</HI> might it not be
<Q><L>The Poor ble&s;t, the Oppre&s;&s;or fear'd him;</L>
<L>Nor did tho&s;e who envy'd pre&s;ume to cen&s;ure his Repu|tation:</L></Q>
or el&s;e,
<Q>Nor did Envy's Breath pre&s;ume to cen&s;ure his Reputation.</Q>
Becau&s;e if I &s;aid, <HI>tho&s;e who envy'd</HI>, it might im|ply that &s;omebody did; which I do not know. <HI>Zeal</HI> being placed after <HI>Affection</HI>, is certainly better, for the rea&s;on you ob&s;erve; and mu&s;t be &s;o, if u&s;ed at all. But upon the whole, I would have Mr. Hall take one of the three copies entire, as you was &s;o kind to &s;end; and I &s;uppo&s;e he will, when he is re&s;tored to his health, &s;en&s;e, and judgment; before which, or then at lea&s;t, I hope we &s;hall talk it over in one of my cells, or under my new pavilion, which he calls <HI>too low</HI>. If it had been higher, it mu&s;t have been in proportion too broad for the walk, and mu&s;t have co&s;t me a great deal by a lead covering; and my hou&s;e would have appeared lower than my pavilion. It is, to be &s;ure, &s;mall, but the plan in the book is not above &s;even inches deeper, and the front is the &s;ame

In the mean time, I keep off all the intruders from their old way to Henley, and have given them a better, which &s;huts their mouths; and none clamber over the hedges but tho&s;e who are not yet apprized of the alteration. Sir Robert Cocks has as many hundred abeles ready for me as I can wi&s;h, again&s;t the bu&s;y month of October next.</P>
<P>It is ju&s;t come into my mind, Sir, that you love good writing, good impre&s;&s;ions to &s;eals, and all other proper decorations of a letter: I ought therefore to &s;ecrete mine, and neither &s;end it, nor ever let you know that I was ca|pable of intending to &s;end &s;uch a &s;crawl: but I con&s;ider <HI>this</HI> mu&s;t go or none; for I never made a copy of a letter in my life, and my hand and pen being upon the gallop, will &s;tum|ble &s;ometimes. If this excu&s;e will not do, you &s;hall have the next as <HI>prim</HI> as Lord S&mdash;d's cravat (&s;o celebrated); but it will not be half a quarter &s;o long.

<P>AS I believe you &s;incere in the impatience you expre&s;s to vi&s;it me at Barrells, I hope you will be &s;o ju&s;t as to believe me equally impatient to receive you here, and doubly di&s;|appointed that a continuation of your di&s;order &s;hould occa&s;ion our not meeting at the times appointed.&mdash;For God's &s;ake, do not venture a journey too &s;oon; yet come as &s;oon as you can. The nature of your illne&s;s gives me pain; your frequent relap&s;es increa&s;e it; but the &s;trength of your con&s;titution, the opinion of your faithful &s;ervant Tom, and the &s;pirit I perceive in your letters, give me plea&s;ure, and encourage me to hope a &s;peedy as well as certain cure; and con&s;equently that the next week will be as favourable to me as I ima|gined, and was per&s;uaded <HI>this</HI> would have
<PB N="113" REF="119">
been. Mr. Outing's being here added to my de&s;ire it &s;hould happen &s;o. I put nobody off upon your account; &s;o be ea&s;y. My hou&s;e, though &s;mall, will never deny me a place for you and your friends, whom I look upon as mine.&mdash;I beg my compliments to Mr. and Mi&s;s Dolman; and need not add, that their com|pany will be always agreeable to me, as well as your Brother's.</P>
<P>How plea&s;ed &s;hould I be if I could help you to a proper Motto for your Gothic Building, which even Spen&s;er has denied you in your pre&s;ent &s;earch! You could ea&s;ily &s;upply his deficiency, and I dare &s;ay you would do it to advantage in his own language. You have &s;hewn your&s;elf capable of <HI>that</HI> already: &s;o, without putting him or me to the blu&s;h, make an <HI>old</HI> Engli&s;h Motto as you have made a Gothic Building, and you will be approved by the moderns, and envied by the ancients.</P>
<P>As to the lines you de&s;ire me to write in my own hand upon one of your &s;kreens, I am ready to do it; for I fear not the cen&s;ure of tho&s;e who may read them, let the multitude be ever &s;o great, &s;ince you have read them, and have not di&s;approved: but I never yet was &s;o puzzled in making my judgment and yours tally. I conceive them to be <HI>bad</HI>, but

you &s;ay they are <HI>good</HI>; therefore I <HI>err</HI>, and per|haps <HI>I err</HI> in &s;aying that the fourth line, filled with mono&s;yllables&punc; is an exceeding bad one. I &s;hall &s;ubmit the moment you &s;peak; but in the mean time imagine, that
<Q>"Pre&s;erving &s;till their Parents beauteous Face,"</Q>
might be as well as what I wrote before, if not better. All I wi&s;h about it is, that you will believe me &s;incere, even in rhime; and that I long for an opportunity of &s;crawling over your &s;eat at the Lea&s;owes with my pen|cil, and of &s;hewing you (as well as Mr. and Mi&s;s Dolman, and Mr. Jo&s;eph Shen&s;tone) at Barrells, that I am, <HI>&s;ans c&eacute;r&eacute;monie</HI>, but with the greater truth,</P>

<P>YESTERDAY and To-day have been &s;pent by Mr. Outing and my&s;elf in looking out to &s;py you coming towards us: but we looked in vain; and our flattering hopes begin to give place to unwelcome de|&s;pair, which is aggravated by the apprehen&s;ions of a fre&s;h relap&s;e of your illne&s;s, and is the cau&s;e of my &s;ending a &s;ervant to enquire after your health; of which I hope to hear a good account; but rather wi&s;h to &s;ee it in your per&s;on, and to hear it from your own mouth.</P>
<P>Mr. Hall came ye&s;terday in the evening to ki&s;s your hands, but found Outing and me lamenting your ab&s;ence; one &s;eated on a turf, the other on a &s;tone at the Hermite&s;s's door, who has acquired a new bed, which may hold not only you, if your colic &s;hould oblige

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM doubtful whether I &s;hould write to you now, as I may expect you are upon the road hither; for Litchfield Races have, as I ima|gine, left Mr. Dolman at liberty ere this; and your di&s;order has I hope left you free to pur&s;ue your inclinations, which Mr. Outing and I are vain enough to believe would lead you hither. If he denied it, he would not gain credit, as all his friends well know he has put off other journies upon that account; and if I denied it, I am &s;ure I &s;hould be un|ju&s;t to you, who &s;hew &s;o much partial fa|vour
<PB N="118" REF="124">
to me and my habitation. This fact therefore being laid down as certain, joined to your not having wrote on Saturday la&s;t, as you promi&s;ed, creates in me &s;ome fears, le&s;t your illne&s;s &s;hould have returned upon you, or not have left you long enough for you to tru&s;t your&s;elf from home. If this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, I &s;hall be doubly di&s;ap|pointed: yet I cannot blame you for choo&s;|ing to be in your own hou&s;e, when confined to a hou&s;e, and on your own bed, when con|&s;trained to lay on one at hours when one mo&s;t wi&s;hes and mo&s;t expects to be able to con|ver&s;e with one's friends, viz. after meals, which are the mo&s;t &s;ociable hours in life, when one is ble&s;t with friends and health to enjoy them. But, Sir, &s;ince blankets and white-wine-whey have not cured you under the care of phy&s;icians, I ought not to &s;uppo&s;e I could per|form that wi&s;hed-for ta&s;k; and yet I will an|&s;wer for it, that were you at Barrells, you would not be tempted to tran&s;gre&s;s the rules pre&s;cribed by tho&s;e phy&s;icians, no more than you would be by the Per&s;ian Rice and Sher|bet you mention; and that might be one &s;tep towards a cure. You would find no co&s;tly viands here; and as for liberty, which you &s;ay you mu&s;t have to eat what you have <HI>not</HI> a
<PB N="119" REF="125">
mind to, you &s;hould have it; but as for li|berty to eat what you <HI>have</HI> a mind to, you &s;hould <HI>not</HI> have it: &s;o pray do not think when you come here, that your &s;teps
<Q>"&mdash; to the Huxter's &s;av'ry Cottage tend;"</Q>
for were I the uncontrouled dame that awed you with birchen power, you &s;hould not find that I greeted you with &s;uch cates, as, by in|dulging your ta&s;te, might pamper your illne&s;s; nor &s;hould you walk out in unwhole&s;ome fogs or dews, nor have I power to walk you round the margin of brooks and fountains if I would: &s;o that, in &s;hort, you would be here as in&s;ipidly &s;afe as ever Valetudinarian was in the clo&s;e&s;t retreat.</P>
<P>The lines you &s;ent me I like greatly; but &s;ince Mr. Lyttelton objects to the two fir&s;t lines of the la&s;t &s;tanza, and that you do not &s;eem much plea&s;ed with them, what if you were to write on your Gothic Seat only the two fir&s;t &s;tanzas, which are unexceptionable? for though the <HI>"Beechen Bowl,"</HI> &amp;c. is well ex|pre&s;&s;ed, and would be va&s;tly pretty in &s;ome other place, I que&s;tion if it is nece&s;&s;ary here: and the threat (if I may &s;o call it) in the la&s;t &s;tanza, is perhaps le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary; as any thing like threatening is what the &s;implicity of a
<PB N="120" REF="126">
rural &s;wain avoids; which character you &s;eem to a&s;&s;ume in the in&s;cription. I had the plea&s;ure to read the other in&s;cription in one of your mo&s;s-&s;eats, and have it al&s;o by me in a former letter of yours.&mdash;I &s;ee you have put <HI>Harm betide</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Ill betide</HI>: the difference is of &s;mall con&s;equence; yet I am unwilling to give up the fir&s;t (<HI>Ill betide</HI>). If you have a mind for a little more critici&s;m from &s;uch a No-Critic as my&s;elf, I think <HI>Sportive</HI> Fawns may &s;up|ply the place of <HI>Rural</HI> Fawns, as they were jocular Deities. You have put <HI>Fringed</HI> Cell in|&s;tead of <HI>Mo&s;&s;y</HI> Cell; which Oberon at fir&s;t called it; but I love <HI>Mo&s;&s;y</HI> &s;till; &s;o attached am I to the fir&s;t of your Editions.</P>
<P>That many parts of your Farm were extra|vagantly commended by Mr. Lyttelton, Miller, &amp;c. I do not wonder at, though I cannot pro|perly term it <HI>Extravagantly</HI>, becau&s;e it was &s;o ju&s;tly and rea&s;onably: and as to the Scape-Goat, (as you call your Summer-hou&s;e) it has now &s;ome merit, and had all the merit you required of it at the time you built it; but I confe&s;s what you have done &s;ince mu&s;t de|grade it: yet I would not have it quite di&s;|regarded, and rather wi&s;h it could be turned to &s;ome u&s;eful ornament.&mdash;Have you a dove-hou&s;e? The nearne&s;s of the water would
<PB N="121" REF="127">
plea&s;e the pigeons; and the &s;ight of them would plea&s;e you: but let the building become what it will, if it remains there, I would have it change its colour from red to white.&mdash;Talk|ing of changing, I mu&s;t tell you of my changes at this cottage. Mr. Outing has put <HI>O Venus Regina Gnidi</HI> in the new Pavilion over Venus's Shrine, oppo&s;ite my hou&s;e, in&s;tead of over the Summer-hou&s;e door, where it was; from which Summer-hou&s;e I have bani&s;hed the two motto's on the &s;ide-doors, as you advi&s;ed. The Pi|ping Fawn is retired from the front of the Aviary to his po&s;t in the Wood, where he &s;tands in the Double Oak, in lieu of the motto <HI>Huc ades</HI>, &amp;c. which being taken down, <HI>Habit&acirc;|runt Dii quoque Sylvas</HI> is to &s;upply its place.&mdash; I have found a kind of natural arbor in the Coppice, with an oak in it, under which I have a mind to rai&s;e a bank of turf and put my Tapping Fawn upon it to dance, with

for a motto. Query, (&s;ays Mr. Outing) Whe|ther a Fawn may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Ditcher? &mdash;I think to put over my Aviary

<P>THIS is Monday; and on Saturday la&s;t I wrote you a letter of great length, which I &s;ent to Henley to be conveyed to the Birmingham Po&s;t-Office, directed to you, to be left there; but finding your illne&s;s con|tinues, and not having heard from you &s;ince the letter in which you promi&s;ed to write to me la&s;t Saturday was &s;evennight, I cannot be ea&s;y without a more particular enquiry con|cerning your health. This is the only &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent me&s;&s;age and letter. The la&s;t letter was a medley, which if you are ill, will tire you to read, and will tire you more to an&s;wer; &s;o I leave you free to make your&s;elf ea&s;y about that, only beg you will let Mr. Outing and me know how you do. As to my&s;elf, I expected to have gone to London this week, but my &s;cheme is altered; nor would I have gone if you had &s;ent me word you would come.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>COULD I &s;uppo&s;e that you laid any &s;tre&s;s upon ceremonial, which is only the &s;ha|dow of friend&s;hip, where you are &s;ecure of its &s;ub&s;tance, I would make you many apologies for &s;ending this letter by the po&s;t, which I ought to have &s;ent to the Lea&s;owes on Monday by a &s;ervant, who &s;hould al&s;o have gone to Broom to enquire how all the agreeable com|pany that left Barrells on Sunday got to their re&s;pective hou&s;es. The omi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e ci|vilities I confe&s;s, and hope to be ab&s;olved when you con&s;ider that they do not proceed from an ungrateful mind. I could not have performed them without a good deal of incon|venience to my&s;elf; and I know they could not be of any con&s;equence to you: but you may be a&s;&s;ured, that your obliging vi&s;it gave
<PB N="126" REF="132">
me much plea&s;ure, and its &s;hort duration much regret, however wanting I may be in expre&s;&s;|ing it.</P>
<P>Mr. Outing left me ye&s;terday morning, much lamenting that he did not go the day before, when he &s;eemed to grudge every ray of &s;un that was &s;een at Barrells, and to dread every drop of rain that might fall the next day on the road to A&s;ton. His fears &s;hould have made him con&s;ult &s;ome &s;kilful almanack|maker; but tru&s;ting to his own ob&s;ervations, I believe he met with a little rain, which (however lightly it might &s;prinkle him) would I dare &s;ay make him cur&s;e the <HI>unjoyous</HI> wea|ther, and call him&s;elf an <HI>unfortunate</HI> hero more than once.</P>
<P>I &s;ee in the news-paper an adverti&s;ement of a Poem, dedicated to the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et, about Family Prayer, by one who &s;eems to be a great admirer of Mr. Hervey. I &s;hould imagine it to be by the Chaplain &s;he talks of in her letter; but do not know.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I did on Monday was to or|der the Ha! Ha! to be lowered two bricks; but found it not nece&s;&s;ary to lower it even one; for the paper you &s;tuck up is &s;een from the Hall-Door by lowering the earth a con&s;ider|able
<PB N="127" REF="133">
length of way. So much higher was it than the Ha! Ha! that it was <HI>that</HI> which ob|&s;tructed the view totally, and not the wall. I al&s;o &s;taked out the ground for the &s;weep of palli&s;adoes and trees at the hither end of the Long Walk, and I bani&s;hed the auricula-pots from the Library-Window; and ye&s;terday I wrote to be&s;peak the pediment for the Pavi|lion.

<P>Should you, if you cho&s;e to erect in my Coppice an urn to the memory of a friend, place it in one of the corners where the trees &s;eem to form an arbour, or in the Middle-Walk, from whence you now &s;ee Claverden? As the latter place is to be filled with trees, it might be perceived through them perhaps to &s;ome advantage from the Shrubbery and Sum|mer-hou&s;e; but if &s;o, it would require to be higher than in the remote parts of the Wood. How high &s;hould you like the pede&s;tal? and how high the urn in either place?</P>

<P>AS I am at pre&s;ent in as languid (though not in &s;o painful) a condition as you have lately been, I might have been excu&s;ed by you, had I not wrote till I found my&s;elf better; but I &s;hould not be excu&s;ed by my&s;elf. My own reproaches would be continual tor|ments to me, did I not take the earlie&s;t oppor|tunity of returning thanks for the Ode you &s;ent me, and for the unmerited compliment it makes to me, and to my little retreat. Were

&s;trict truth as nece&s;&s;ary to poetry as it is to hi&s;tory, you would be guilty of a great fault in placing the &s;cene here, where the Mu&s;es never come, except when you bring them. But as poetical licences are allowable, this error may be &s;o too: and I am per&s;uaded no other can be found in your plan; nor do I believe that even <HI>you</HI> can find any thing in the compo&s;ition to amend, and yet I will not give a copy till you permit me, becau&s;e I would not willingly di&s;obey any of your commands.&mdash;Be&s;ides the plea&s;ure your letter and ver&s;es afford me in reading, and the pride they indulge in making me the &s;ubject of them, they give me a third &s;atisfaction, which exceeds the others, and that is, the looking upon them as proofs of your late di&s;order having quite left you: which I think I may do; for illne&s;s would di&s;able your ge|nius from working with that vigour one may ob&s;erve in the&s;e productions of it. And indeed the very impre&s;&s;ions which bodily pain com|monly leaves, would be yet too recent in a vulgar mind to allow it the free u&s;e of its faculties: but yours is &s;uperior to others, even when it is mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>

better, that I proceed to tell you that my only architect (who is a joiner at Warwick) happens to be very ill, &s;o that the pediment is not fini&s;hed: perhaps not begun. I have ordered him to make it low, and agreeable to the Doric order, as the pillars of the Temple are. I men|tioned three urns: he talks of three figures. I do not know if three balls would not be as well. Lord Burlington u&s;es them a good deal.&mdash;When I have an opportunity, I will enquire of the knowing which are the proper books of Architecture for your u&s;e; and in the mean time will &s;end you the only one I have that teaches the rudiments of that &s;cience. Wor&s;e print or wor&s;e paper you never &s;aw! It co&s;t me five &s;hillings at one of O&s;borne's &s;ales, thirteen years ago. Perhaps you will get a better printed one of the kind, if you like this upon looking it over.&mdash;As to the urn for Mr. Somervile, he has wrote me the price of a plain one in wood, and al&s;o in Warwick &s;tone; but it is only twenty inches high at that price: which I &s;uppo&s;e is not half high enough; and he &s;ends a frightful common pede&s;tal in the inclo&s;ed draught.&mdash;I have a fancy for an urn on a round altar, and have &s;crawled out &s;uch a thing my&s;elf, and &s;ent it to Mr. Williams to put in oil, and
<PB N="131" REF="137" MS="Y">
to paint green trees round, that I may gue&s;s at the effect it will have. The urn I drew from a little pair the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et turned for me in wood, from an antique urn the Counte&s;s of Pomfret brought her from Italy. It has no cover. You will &s;ee how it is when Williams &s;ends it back. In the mean time, pray think of a place to &s;et the urn in; for I cannot plea&s;e my&s;elf about it.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this place of my letter I am inter|rupted by one from Mi&s;s Patty Meredith, to de&s;ire I will &s;end four of my hor&s;es to join two of Mrs. Meredith's to bring them hither from Wol&s;eley-Bridge on Friday next the 20th; &s;o I will not &s;end this epi&s;tle till they come, choo&s;ing to wait, in order to make it more worth your reading, by &s;ending you Mi&s;s Patty's opinion, and Mi&s;s Harriot's, about pla|cing the urn.</P>
<P>I will only add here, that I am &s;orry for the u&s;age you have met with from your Par&s;on: but hope your path goes on, and could wi&s;h it had been where you propo&s;ed, in defiance of eccle&s;i|a&s;tical &s;pite; but &s;ince that is impracticable, at lea&s;t flatter my&s;elf that you will di&s;appoint his malicious intent, by making a path on your own land equally pretty, and out of the reach of their powers, who endeavoured to prevent the

dictates of your ta&s;te. Place it ever &s;o far from them, it is po&s;&s;ible their envy may reach it, and trace it to its full extent: but what of that, if they cannot mole&s;t it otherwi&s;e? And I will fancy you can have one that will even exceed in beauty that which you fir&s;t thought of.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day, October 25th.</P>
<P>By various accidents I have waited in vain for Mrs. Meredith till this day, and have not yet had time to write, nor weather to &s;eek for &s;ituations in the Coppice.</P>
<P>Friday, 27th.</P>
<P>To-morrow morning a &s;ketch of Mi&s;s Patty's will go to the Lea&s;owes, in hopes of &s;aving the town of Birmingham; but it is impo&s;&s;ible to find time to write a line with it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PRAY read the inclo&s;ed letter fir&s;t.&mdash;I hope you received a Sketch on Saturday. &mdash;This beginning will &s;eem abrupt: more &s;o than Mr. Whi&s;tler's! but my rea&s;on for it
<PB N="133" REF="139">
is the &s;ame as his. If he is pardoned after a &s;ilence of &s;ix months, perhaps I may receive the &s;ame favour. My &s;ilence was not of &s;uch long duration. My crime was not &s;o great, becau&s;e it did not deprive you of &s;o much plea&s;ure; and my contrition is as great as his can be: and if you will believe me, I blu&s;h as much as he could do; and neither of us can expre&s;s <HI>that</HI> upon paper; therefore, I hope you will believe us both, and re&s;tore me as well as Mr. Whi&s;tler to your friend&s;hip. My pleading for him is an act of &s;upererogation, as he has pleaded &s;o much better for him&s;elf: and yet I have no other way of &s;hewing my gratitude for his mention of me. How proud &s;hould I be of what he &s;ays of me, were I not at the &s;ame time humbled, by knowing my merit cannot have attracted his applau&s;e, &s;ince he never was in my company! The &s;ame con|&s;ideration &s;hould make me wi&s;h he never might be in it, le&s;t he &s;hould be undeceived to my di&s;ad|vantage. But upon the whole, weighing my lo&s;&s;es and gains by the notion I have conceived of his conver&s;ation by what I have &s;een of his writings, I think I would venture to let him di&s;cover my ignorance, rather than be deprived of his com|pany; which you promi&s;ed la&s;t year to give me, by his accompanying you to Barrells;
<PB N="134" REF="140">
where (by the way) if you plea&s;e to come now, I can offer you more than I have yet been able to do; which is the conver&s;ation of Mrs. Meredith and four of her daughters.&mdash; The Yellow Room which Mi&s;s Dolman lay in, when you was la&s;t here, is empty.&mdash;I &s;hould rejoice to &s;ee you.&mdash;The month of October calls upon you to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in planting; and I know you would not choo&s;e to be remi&s;s in acts of friend&s;hip. I offer you an occa&s;ion of &s;hewing yours; and unle&s;s you go to Lon|don to meet Mr. Whi&s;tler, I think I may expect you will do me this favour before the new moon decays. I would fain endeavour to wipe off the prejudice you have taken again&s;t Autumn; and if the&s;e four young ladies do not a&s;&s;i&s;t me, I fear I &s;hall never meet with &s;ucce&s;s; nor can any thing be more likely to enliven the melancholy a&s;pect you dread when days grow &s;hort and leaves turn yellow.</P>
<P>We have &s;earched every corner of the Cop|pice, and can find no oak-tree favourable to our de&s;ign, unle&s;s it is the great double oak, within which Outing placed the Piping Fawn. The tree is unexceptionable for that u&s;e; but the &s;ituation you will think, I dare &s;ay, too much expo&s;ed, e&s;pecially as the entrance is &s;o very near from the Abele Walks: if that can
<PB N="135" REF="141">
be obviated, perhaps thickening that part with trees and ever-greens may render it more proper: if not, Mi&s;s Harriot, nor Mi&s;s Patty, nor I, can think of no place but the brink of the Pit, a little below which &s;tands an oak, that &s;preads a good deal over it; again&s;t which oak Mi&s;s Patty, in the inclo&s;ed Sketch, pro|po&s;es to &s;et the urn and altar, and to &s;hade it round with yews, laurels, &amp;c. and give up the re&s;t of the Pit to the open field, and al&s;o to plant the Sand Walk that now leads into the Coppice and up to the Two Chairs, full of trees, and let the way be a narrow &s;erpen|tine path through it, backward from the Pit, leading into the inward part of the Coppice; on the right &s;ide of which is an old &s;tump of oak, which may make a proper back to a root-&s;eat, from whence you will view the urn in a direct line fronting &s;o as to be able to read the in&s;cription.&mdash;Let us know if you conceive my meaning and Mi&s;s Patty's Draw|ing; and whether our idea is likely to appear well when put in practice.</P>
<P>I received two days ago, Mr. Williams's <HI>Sketch</HI>, as he calls it, though he has made it a real Picture from my Sketch, and has made the pede&s;tal &s;quare in&s;tead of round, &s;aying it is mo&s;t proper as the urn is round: his paint|ing
<PB N="136" REF="142">
has no regard to &s;ituation.&mdash;The &s;teps in Mi&s;s Patty's Sketch are, if you remember, leading into the Pit from a corner over again&s;t the great oak, and terminate by &s;ome willows.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Harriot &s;ays,&mdash;Query. Would it be ami&s;s, in&s;tead of planting the Sand-Walk, to throw the earth down &s;o as to make it a turfed &s;lope from the Coppice, in&s;tead of a perpendi|cular &s;ide of a Pit as it now is? and would it not help to take off the ugly look of a marle-pit which it now has?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Patty is amu&s;ing her&s;elf in copying Watts, and I in being a thief, which &s;he com|plains the more of, as the boy &s;he was draw|ing is not fini&s;hed; but I will inclo&s;e it in &s;pite of her, becau&s;e I am</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE heard of giving one guinea to a mu&s;ician to play, and ten to leave off. Thus are you, I believe, by this time inclin|able to reward old <HI>Emma</HI>, and to di&s;mi&s;s her from the office of po&s;twoman. For her &s;ake I ought to write &s;eldomer, unle&s;s I could make my letters &s;uch as could render her
<PB N="138" REF="144">
welcome when &s;he pre&s;ents you with the large packets &s;he finds at Birmingham from Bar|rells. &mdash;What occa&s;ions my troubling you again &s;o &s;oon is, that Mrs. Meredith and her daughters leave me the beginning of next week, and I &s;hould be glad to know before that, what &s;ize you would choo&s;e the urn and pede&s;tal &s;hould be of: for as to the le$$er ones at Hagley, you do not mention their $i|men&s;ion; and the twenty inches Mr. Hands talked of, was cau&s;ed by the mi&s;take of a figure in my letter. The little nook which you have forgot, is over again&s;t you when you &s;it under the great double oak, and from it go down winding &s;teps which I had cut a great while ago in the earth to lead to the bottom of the Pit, but are &s;haded by the trees which grow on the brink of it; and a little before you come to the bottom, there is like a narrow landing-place, where grows a &s;hort row of willows, which form a kind of little hedge at the foot of an old oak which grows on the bank, and there is the &s;pot we propo&s;ed to &s;et the urn. Mi&s;s Patty drew it wrong, when &s;he made it of a line with the tree; and Mi&s;s Harriot's propo&s;al is to &s;lope off the bank quite from the trees on the left &s;ide the walk which now is, down to the &s;aid willows, which
<PB N="139" REF="145">
are at pre&s;ent four feet and a half below the edge of the bank; and I believe it will have a good effect. Mi&s;s Patty has <HI>&s;crawled</HI> (for &s;he can do nothing well with compa&s;&s;es) three views of an urn, viz. one front and two end-views.&mdash;Query, Whether the harp and the reeds &s;hould be carved flat on the urn, or pro|ject as in N^o. 1. and whether you like the &s;hape; as al&s;o if this Ionic pede&s;tal is &s;uitable, and whether with or without the bay-wreath or the &s;quare for the in&s;cription?&mdash;I never intended four lyres. We did intend to leave the lower part of the Pit, from the Willows downwards, perpendicular.&mdash;I am glad you like balls for the pediment. The &s;weep is formed by the pali&s;ades: the elms are all moved from the lawn on the &s;outh-&s;ide my hou&s;e, to &s;top up the opening of the Coppice on the ea&s;t from hence as you directed, and &s;ome limes are among them.</P>
<P>I thank you for &s;ending Gibbs's book; which I will take care of, but never yet could admire his ta&s;te in Architecture. The monument for the late Duke of Newca&s;tle gives a &s;pecimen of it; and even his genteele&s;$ things he di&s;graces commonly with &s;ome awk|ward ornament. His building at Cambridge I have &s;een, but never could like.&mdash;Pardon me
<PB N="140" REF="146">

My knowledge does not extend very far, as learned as I am; and yet I know that it is the fa&s;hion for every body to write a couplet to the &s;ame tune (viz. an old country-dance) upon whatever &s;ubject occurs to them; I &s;hould &s;ay upon whatever per&s;on, with their names to it.

It con&s;i&s;ts, as you will find, of puns (or as the French properly call it, <HI>Jeu de mots</HI>) upon his name; and though I never was a lover of puns, I do not di&s;like the na|tural &s;prightly turn of the&s;e; and I hope they will amu&s;e you a few moments, for the rea&s;on you quote from Cibber (him&s;elf!) <Q>&startq;That &endq;&s;mall matters amu&s;e in the country."</Q> The truth of which mo&s;t people have felt, or are unfeeling and unhappy.</P>

I wi&s;h it may be for the better.

Twenty-&s;even good &s;traight elms, in&s;tead of them, make the lines parallel; and I have hopes of knocking down ten <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> trees, which ob&s;tructed the pro&s;pect (as you and Mr. Hall a&s;&s;ured me) from the Old Summer-hou&s;e.&mdash;If the whole College of King's in Cambridge &s;hould be more favourable to me than one &s;ingle joint of a foe (I will not &s;ay limb) of a College which you had to deal with, I &s;hall triumph: but I mu&s;t not brag too &s;oon; perhaps my &s;cheme may prove as abortive as yours.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter of the 26th ult. and mine of the 29th, cro&s;&s;ed each other at Birming|ham. The next day yours arrived &s;afe at Barrells, and gave me more than wonted plea|&s;ure, as my &s;pirits much wanted &s;uch a cor|dial, being depre&s;&s;ed by various things, parti|cularly by the death of Mr. Davis, who leaves his Widow, (my friend) whom I love and e&s;teem, in deep affliction, though without tears, or pomp of &s;orrow. He was a gentleman-like man, generous, and capable of being a friend; which many in higher life are not: and to her he was Brother, Father, Friend, as well as tender Hu&s;band. She had not recovered the concern the lo&s;s of her only child had cau&s;ed her, when this greater misfortune befel her.&mdash;We are all born to &s;uffer afflictions; and I have had a large &s;hare: but I &s;incerely prote&s;t none has ever been felt by me &s;o &s;e|verely as tho&s;e which have befallen my friends. And as if <HI>that</HI> was well known to my evil &s;tar, it &s;heds its influence over mo&s;t of tho&s;e
<PB N="150" REF="156">
per&s;ons I have an affection for.&mdash;Pray God it may not reach you!</P>
<P>Here I break off to tell you Outing's an|&s;wer to my me&s;&s;age in his own words; which are the&s;e, <Q>&startq;My motions are at &s;o great an uncertainty, that it makes me unea&s;y to my&s;elf and rude to my friends. The hopes of &s;eeing Mr. Shen&s;tone prevented me from writing to him; and now that I am able to do it, <HI>Will</HI>'s impatience prevents me from &endq;telling him &s;o."</Q>&mdash;This &s;aid <HI>Will</HI>, you mu&s;t know, is the me&s;&s;enger I &s;ent early one morn|ing, and he did not return till late next even|ing, becau&s;e Mr. Outing kept him to have time to an&s;wer my letter; which he did an|&s;wer about the tenth part of: the di&s;tance is fourteen miles, and the me&s;&s;enger a &s;peedy one. &mdash;Jacky Reynalds has been here &s;ince, and tells me he is at pre&s;ent at Sir Robert Cocks's, con&s;ulting every per&s;on and every map to find out (not the longitude, but) the neare&s;t way to Port&s;mouth, whether through London or acro&s;s the country. His per&s;on is &s;till as I &s;uppo&s;e in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, his be&s;t cloaths are at Barrells, and his thoughts on board the Hazard Sloop (where the lad he has the care of is to be placed) or rather on the road thi|ther, where I do not doubt but he fancies there
<PB N="151" REF="157">
are dragons innumerable waiting for him; for an indolent per&s;on may form as many difficul|ties when he is to undertake a journey, as a child frightened by its nur&s;e, or a per&s;on who has the <HI>night-mare</HI> &s;ees bugbears.</P>
<P>The hopes you give me of the Green-Book feeds my imagination, and I flatter my|&s;elf the fir&s;t &s;wallow will bring it; for I do not imagine you will honour the robin-red-brea&s;t with your errand; and he is the only feathered vi&s;itant I am likely to have for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>If I was not tender of encroaching upon Mrs. Emme Scudamore's rights, I would pro|po&s;e to you to exchange a pair or two of pigeons of the carrier kind (of which I have &s;ome) next &s;pring; and by winter they may convey letters to and from the Lea&s;owes and Barrells with great diligence, without her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or her friend William's. Why &s;hould it not be done here as well as abroad, as it is e&s;pecially by our merchants in the ea&s;tern countries, who often gain riches by early ad|vice that expeditious way? and why &s;hould the fund of fortune be &s;till &s;upplied with care, and that of friend&s;hip neglected? It is to the latter I would rai&s;e an altar, and wi&s;h to have it blaze as bright as that &s;eems to do in the
<PB N="152" REF="158">
ingenious device you &s;ent me, which is (<HI>&s;ans compliment</HI>) the prettie&s;t of the kind I ever &s;aw for a &s;eal; and hope you will permit me to make u&s;e of it by having one cut according to it.</P>
<P>Sunday, December 10th, 1749.</P>
<P>Here I broke off, with an intention of copying my letter, and &s;ending a neater edition of it, this being full of blots; but had not an opportunity of &s;ending it &s;afely to Birming|ham; when on Friday I received yours, of the 5th, and this moment your la&s;t, of the 7th, by Pedley's &s;on. As he is to return in the morning early, and I am to have Lord Archer and other company at dinner to-morrow, I &s;hall not have time to copy it over; &s;o beg you will excu&s;e it, and receive this incorrect epi&s;tle for the &s;ake of its candour, not for its wit or its beauty: for it has no more pretence to either, than a hurdygurdy has to harmony.</P>
<P>I think Mr. Meredith's account of your Grove is a very true one; and as to what re|lates to the buildings (&s;ince he choo&s;es to make a parallel between them and tho&s;e at Hagley) I dare &s;ay you will not di&s;pute giv|ing the preference to the latter; nor &s;et your Gothic Bench in oppo&s;ition to their Gothic Ca&s;tle: and yet give me leave to &s;ay the for|mer
<PB N="153" REF="159">
is in the better ta&s;te and proportion. Mr. Meredith never &s;aw Hagley, therefore I won|der how he came to &s;peak of it as a judge: That he admires the Lea&s;owes is certain, and is ju&s;t.&mdash;I hate puns as much as you can do; but they &s;erve now and then, as &s;uch di&s;hes which the French call <HI>Hors d'oeuvres</HI>, to inter|&s;per&s;e among&s;t tho&s;e of more &s;ub&s;tance, and are counted as nothing.</P>
<P>I like your fancy of making your par&s;on Bi&s;hop of Nova Scotia, which would be making him of &s;ome u&s;e. I have not experi|enced the good luck you wi&s;h me with eccle|&s;ia&s;tics: &s;o cannot &s;ay any thing in their fa|vour; though I wi&s;h I could, becau&s;e of their function, which puts it in their power to do good or hurt: and they generally choo&s;e the latter.</P>
<P>It is time to &s;peak to you about the Urn; which I cannot do without returning you a million of thanks for your intere&s;ting your&s;elf &s;o much in what gives me plea&s;ure, and for the trouble you have given your&s;elf in draw|ing out the &s;everal &s;ketches of urns; all which are in exceeding good ta&s;te, if mine may be permitted to judge. I &s;ent one (the &s;malle&s;t in the drawings) to Warwick, to a&s;k what it would co&s;t if executed quite plain

with the pede&s;tal, and the &s;ize of the le&s;&s;er ones at Hagley, according to what you wrote me about them; and am to have an an&s;wer next Tue&s;day, though I do not propo&s;e having it made yet; for the weather will not allow it to be &s;et up with &s;afety, as I imagine, till about April.&mdash;I would employ Pedley pre|ferably to any other workman, if I had it worked at home, both from your recommen|dation and his own &s;kill; as al&s;o from compa&s;|&s;ion for his misfortunes: but I have &s;everal rea&s;ons which prevent my having it done at home; and among&s;t others, I have no place to have it worked in, nor any to keep it in when fini&s;hed, till it is a proper &s;ea&s;on to &s;et it up. Had Pedley had any dwelling where he could have made it, and from whence I could have &s;ent for it, I would order it im|mediately, though it were to co&s;t me more; but as it is, I cannot employ him, becau&s;e I cannot have it done at home; which I am &s;orry for, e&s;pecially as you, Sir, recommend him, which weighs not a little with me; nor &s;hall any one el&s;e do that or any thing in his way for me but him, if ever I have any &s;tone worked here.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedne&s;day.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I an&s;wered yours by your &s;ervant, I told you I had not time to examine the urns you kindly &s;ketched out for me (Mr. Allen, &amp;c. chattering round me). I have now looked them over, and like them well. I think the proportion of the large one (N^o. 5.) &s;eems to be very ju&s;t; and I believe the le&s;&s;er &s;ize is big enough for my &s;mall Coppice. I cannot <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> admire the foliage at the necks of the urns, either at bottom or on the cover. I think tho&s;e fluted thus are better; and it is full ornamental enough, if they mu&s;t not be quite plain. As to the placing the Poetical Attributes either on the urn or the pede&s;tal, or on both, you have given variety of agreeable &s;pecimens. I confe&s;s, what plea&s;es my eye mo&s;t is the fi&s;tula and pipe on the fifth urn, and the oval wreath on the fir&s;t pede&s;tal. The lyre, erect as it is &s;hewn on the &s;econd pede&s;tal, I cannot ad|mire; nor do I like the &s;urrounding fe&s;toons,
<PB N="156" REF="162">
N^o. 1, 3, 4, &s;o well as the &s;light fe&s;toon in the middle: &s;o that I had fixed upon having the pipe, &amp;c. on the urn, and the wreath on the pede&s;tal, and was con&s;idering about what &s;hould be on the other &s;ide, when I recol|lected, that if the urn is placed, as I la&s;t pro|po&s;ed, under the great Double Oak, there will only be one &s;ide &s;een perfect, viz. that which will front the new entrance at the corner of the Pit; the oppo&s;ite &s;ide will be hid by the tree, and the &s;ide towards the Ser|vice Walk will be filled up with trees, and the &s;ame on the other &s;ide: Therefore if you think that &s;omething ornamental &s;hould be &s;een through the trees, we mu&s;t have a &s;ur|rounding fe&s;toon of natural flowers tied with knots, as in N^o. 3: But (if you have no objec|tion) I &s;hould rather like to have the urn plain all but on one &s;ide, as is for example Mrs. Lyttelton's urn in Hagley Church, where &s;he is lying on a couch; and nothing is repre|&s;ented on the other three &s;ides. In this ca&s;e, I would by all means have the pipe, &amp;c. as you have introduced it (N^o. 5.) on the large urn, and the oval wreath on the pede&s;tal, with the Engli&s;h in&s;cription within it, as it is on that you &s;ent, (N^o. 1.) and the <HI>His Saltem</HI> on the upper plinth, as in N^o. 4. But then,
<PB N="157" REF="163">
where can we write the <HI>Po&s;tquam</HI>, &amp;c.? May it not be ju&s;t above the wreath? All this would enrich the front, and the re&s;t would be plain, and only beautiful by the &s;hape and proportion. I cannot like lyres or even ma&s;ks on an urn, I mean any thing that projects &s;o much on the &s;ides; it takes off that roundne&s;s which is its beauty.&mdash;I thought to have the urn and pede&s;tal worked at the Marble-yard at Warwick, and to &s;end my own team for them. I &s;uppo&s;e Pedley made my urns which are on the New Summer-hou&s;e there, and that he &s;till works there. He can gue&s;s at the value of &s;uch a one as we propo&s;e, if you are &s;o good to a&s;k him; and I &s;hould be very willing to have it made by him. You may know the price if quite plain, or one &s;ide adorned as abovementioned; or el&s;e the fe&s;toon round, and the wreath on one front of the pede&s;tal; or the &s;light wreath in the middle on three &s;ides, and the tibia, &amp;c. on the fourth, with the pipe and a lyre obliquely placed with it, in&s;tead of the &s;prig of laurel, as the laurel-wreath will be below it. But after all, this la&s;t will be a dearer way, becau&s;e the pede&s;tal would require &s;omething on four &s;ides: &s;o, if you plea&s;e we will &s;tick to carving only the front, as I mentioned before; and if that
<PB N="158" REF="164">
&s;hould be quite improper, I mu&s;t in that ca&s;e &s;ubmit to the &s;urrounding fe&s;toon; but &s;hall give up the fi&s;tula and pipe with very great regret: &s;o hope it is allowable to keep it.</P>
<P>If you was not as anxious as my&s;elf to have due honour paid to the memory of our wor|thy friend, I &s;hould not be &s;o rude as to in|terrupt thus often your amu&s;ements, and turn your thoughts from the plea&s;ing decorations you are daily adding at the Lea&s;owes to tho&s;e humble ones I exhibit here.&mdash;What would I give for a little &s;tream to run at the foot of this pede&s;tal! I dare &s;ay you would be ge|nerous enough to part with a &s;mall rivulet, if you could per&s;uade it to run down hither.&mdash;I imagine your i&s;lands mu&s;t have a pretty effect. &mdash;Is your Summer-hou&s;e yet transformed; or does it remain a butt for Mr. Lyttelton's and Mr. Miller's cen&s;ure? They find &s;o much at the Lea&s;owes to rai&s;e their envy, and con|&s;equently their &s;pleen, that it is happy for them &s;ome one object offers that they can vent it upon: when <HI>that</HI> is removed, they will wi&s;h it up again; &s;o vexed will they be to find them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity of commending. What can be a greater misfortune to a cri|tic? Pope would have died many years ago, had he been obliged to refrain from &s;atire, the
<PB N="159" REF="165">
&s;ole delight of his little peevi&s;h temper. How happy was he to meet with a Timon at his villa! The world furni&s;hes many: but tho&s;e who would find one, mu&s;t not &s;eek him at the Lea&s;owes.</P>
<P>How charitable would it be, Sir, if you would take a trip to this little Retreat at this melancholy &s;ea&s;on!&mdash;The Engli&s;h hang them|&s;elves, it is &s;aid, in the month of November, and I find the French begin to catch the in|fection; for they go to <HI>la Trappe</HI>; that and hanging are &s;ynonimous. What then, if, to in|dulge the &s;plenetic humour which the den&s;ity of the air and the &s;hortne&s;s of the days in|cline you to, you &s;hould come and &s;pend them in my chimney-corner? Nothing will put you enough in mind of &s;pring to make you regret it, unle&s;s it is the &s;inging of my two Canary-birds; and they &s;hall, if you plea&s;e, be &s;ent out of the parlour; after which the mo&s;t pro|found &s;ilence will reign, and dulne&s;s be tri|umphant. This is what I invite you to; but you will be no &s;ooner here than the &s;cene will appear to me quite changed: my propo&s;al is therefore mercenary: I confe&s;s it, &s;elf-love will have it &s;o.&mdash;<HI>A propos</HI>, Where is the Green-Book? Why did I ever tru&s;t it out of my hands? Will it not, when copied over, ho|nour

May I hope that you will &s;et about it in ear|ne&s;t, at your lei&s;ure hours?&mdash;Adieu: I &s;carce know what I write.&mdash;Par&s;on Allen kept me up till Three to hear his &s;tories; and on Sun|day I &s;at up all night, and &s;hall not keep much more regular hours till after next Friday; for I am to dine and &s;up at Spernal, (the Par&s;on will have it &s;o) and on that day (or rather on Saturday morning) I &s;hall take leave of the pre&s;ent moon: nor &s;hall I have occa&s;ion to u&s;e the next; for the roads will be impa&s;|&s;able by that time for a carriage that quar|ters, and indeed there will be nobody &s;carcely left in the country to vi&s;it.

<P>Shall you not hear from Mr. Whi&s;tler from London? his letters will entertain you; and you will I dare &s;ay let me partake of the plea|&s;ure.&mdash;When the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et returns from Bath, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall hear from Her Grace.&mdash;Mi&s;s Patty promi&s;es to write; but I much &s;u&s;pect the numerous amu&s;ements Lon|don affords to one of her age, and who has
<PB N="161" REF="167">
never &s;pent but the la&s;t &s;prings there, nor ever &s;een it before, will often prevent her &s;itting down to write.&mdash;Among&s;t other diver&s;ions, I find they act plays &s;ometimes at home, to which all Mrs. Meredith's acquaintance are invited. Mr. Meredith and &s;ome other young gentlemen do the mens parts, and Mi&s;s Patty the top part of the women&mdash;They have &s;cenes from the Play-hou&s;e, and make proper &s;tage-dre&s;&s;es&mdash;Her acting is much admired. I made her do a &s;cene or two, to give me a notion of it, and it &s;truck me.&mdash;Monimia was what &s;he acted at home: but I think &s;he does &s;ome of the mad parts (which Mrs. Cibber is fa|mous for) very finely.&mdash;Next &s;ummer they propo&s;e a much longer &s;tay at Barrells, where I hope you will meet them; and they may &s;hew you &s;ome of the&s;e kind of amu&s;ements, &s;o uncommon in the&s;e unfrequented &s;hades; if we can mu&s;ter up performers.</P>

<P>YESTERDAY mu&s;t be marked with the blacke&s;t ink in the kalendar of my life. My friends and neighbours &s;eemed to combine, and leave me at once to &s;olitude and regret. Mrs. Meredith and her four daughters &s;et out from hence, at eight o'clock, in their coach with my hor&s;es, for Oxford; and Mr. Hall &s;et out at the &s;ame time from Henley in the &s;tage: he will not be at London before ten or fourteen days: they will be there on Thur&s;day.&mdash;Mrs. Meredith and I &s;at up all night on Sunday, by choice; the re&s;t went to bed; by which contrivance I &s;ecured to my&s;elf &s;ome re&s;t la&s;t night: whereas if Sleepi|ne&s;s had not forced me to it, Thought would have deprived me of it.&mdash;Nothing is &s;o ter|rible as parting from friends: and to have
<PB N="163" REF="169" MS="Y">
taken leave and then have gone to bed, had been &s;uch an image of death, that I avoided it as much as po&s;&s;ible, and endeavoured to bani&s;h them all from my mind.&mdash;Luckily a man came to fell &s;ome trees, ju&s;t as they were &s;etting out: and immediately looking upon him as upon a tutelar angel &s;ent to my a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, I never returned to the hou&s;e, but walked, under his protection, all over my grounds, and particularly to the farther end of the Long Avenue; where I ordered a crooked row of &s;crub trees to be fallen, and a &s;trait row of elms to be planted, and other views to be opened, by felling and tran&s;planting about the Old Summer-hou&s;e; as al&s;o near the Grove-Pool, to &s;hew the winding of the walk from the Coppice and other points; and &s;e|veral roots to be &s;tocked up for future root|hou&s;es.&mdash;<HI>A propos:</HI> I have taken the liberty this moment to &s;end your tru&s;ty Tom to recon|noitre a place in the Coppice for a root-&s;eat; as al&s;o &s;ome roots I have &s;tocked, to &s;ee if there are enough. You will permit him &s;ome time to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in making one. This I have thoughts of placing in a corner near where the two chairs now &s;tand; from which one &s;hall ju&s;t di&s;cover a bit of a Glouce&s;ter&s;hire hill over the Pit; but it will be through a

very narrow winding-path, the re&s;t of that Open being to be full planted.&mdash;Since I am &s;peaking of that part of my environs, I will tell you of a new &s;cheme I have formed for placing the urn. I thought, before I received yours, that the area round the bottom of the pede&s;tal would be too narrow in the place we had once fixed upon for the urn; and I al&s;o think the tree, which would be its canopy there, is too incon&s;iderable: &s;o that my pre&s;ent de&s;ign is to place it under the Great Double Oak, who&s;e venerable trunk will &s;upport and branches &s;hade it more properly than the other oak could have done. It will be like rai&s;ing a throne, as well as a monument, for Mr. Somervile; and could he &s;ee it, he would, I believe, think him&s;elf more honour|ably placed than if he was <HI>kicked</HI> down below one's feet, which might offend his elevated &s;pirit.&mdash;What think you then of filling the end of the Service Walk, where the entrance now is, with trees, re&s;erving glades for the pro&s;pects, but hiding the hou&s;e and gardens, and of placing the urn there, as much &s;urrounded with ever-greens as po&s;&s;ible, and having a &s;mall entrance from the field, in the nook near the cor|ner of the Pit, which will front the fore-part of the urn, but which is not to be the common
<PB N="165" REF="171">
entrance to the Coppice? Perhaps a little root-&s;eat may be there, under the &s;hade of the hedge, in&s;tead of where the Chairs are; from whence one may contemplate the urn one way, and have a pro&s;pect through one of the openings of the Walk the other:&mdash;But this la&s;t thing of the &s;eat comes into my head only now as I write; the re&s;t I thought of before, and &s;crawled it on a bit of rumpled paper, only to make my&s;elf comprehend my own meaning; and when I had done, was going to throw it in the fire, when I received yours; by which I conceived that you had doubts about the propriety of the lower &s;itua|tion. This makes me venture to &s;end this &s;ame rumpled &s;crawl, which may perhaps give you an idea of my la&s;t intention, which I &s;hall execute, unle&s;s you di&s;approve it.&mdash; Mi&s;s Harriot's thought is undoubtedly right, and &s;hall be pur&s;ued. The Serpentine &s;hall not be on the brink of the Pit, as de&s;cribed in the paper, but &s;hall go through the mid&s;t of the trees, and the Pit be all given to the field from the willows. The &s;lope &s;hall be turfed as far as the willows: below that &s;hall be perpendicular. Some white pales I have, may go where the &s;teps now are, to reach the willows, and fence out the cattle.

I am for having no other ornament than <HI>that</HI> to the urn, and no other than the bay-wreath to the pede&s;tal.&mdash;What if a lyre was added obliquely to the tibia and fi&s;tula, or el&s;e hung upon the other &s;ide of the urn, and the bay-branch left out, as the pede&s;tal will have bay enough upon it?&mdash; The Coat of Arms would be greatly ab&s;urd, for the rea&s;ons you give; but I could wi&s;h I had a medallion of him carved wi|thin the wreath: but that is not to be had.&mdash;I &s;hall leave the proportions to your judgment, but think the le&s;&s;er one at Hagley

Upon the whole, I would have it very plain: the wreath on the pede&s;tal, and the fi&s;tula and wreath on the urn are &s;ufficient. Ma&s;ks or lyres, or any thing as handles, &s;poil the look, and the proportion, in my opinion.&mdash; Could you not complete your favours, by a&s;king Pedley what he would do it for in Warwick-&s;tone?&mdash;I return Gibbs; and cannot like Mr. Coul&s;ton's dre&s;s and full-bottomed wig on a tomb.&mdash;You are welcome to keep my old book as long as you plea&s;e; and I will enquire about modern ones.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE hopes you give me of &s;eeing you here the&s;e holidays, are more wel|come than any New-year's-gift I could have received: and as the fro&s;t is over, I depend upon their not being fru&s;trated.&mdash;Your com|pa&s;&s;ion for Mrs. Davis &s;hews a good heart; and I think &s;he de&s;erves the opinion you have conceived of her; of which I acquainted her, being glad to contribute towards every plea&s;ure &s;he is capable of feeling in her pre|&s;ent melancholy circum&s;tances. The remarks they &s;ugge&s;t to you, are perfectly ju&s;t and philo&s;ophical: but the difficulty is, how to put in practice what you would advi&s;e; for I know by my own experience, that the things which amu&s;e when the heart and mind are at ea&s;e, cea&s;e to do &s;o when they are &s;trongly affected, and when amu&s;ements are mo&s;t wanted to divert thought from the &s;ubject that cau&s;es grief: And yet I am &s;till &s;o far of your opinion, that I cannot be &s;orry (though &s;he is &s;o) that it is her lot to have a multipli|city of bu&s;ine&s;s to go through (being &s;ole
<PB N="172" REF="178">
executrix to her hu&s;band); nor that &s;he has already quitted the hou&s;e &s;he lived in, hav|ing let it: for the hurry this has cau&s;ed, joined to the examining various books of accounts, &amp;c. mu&s;t, I think, &s;ometimes have obliged her, notwith&s;tanding delicacy of ima|gination, to turn her thoughts from the dead to the living. It is true, &s;he looks upon the&s;e affairs as irk&s;ome: but as &s;he is now incapable of reli&s;hing tho&s;e diver&s;ions which are calculated for plea&s;ure, I think it is well the&s;e others pre&s;ent them&s;elves; without which, I am per&s;uaded &s;he would give her&s;elf up to unavailing regret, though not with that pomp of &s;orrow, which I never can for|bear &s;uppo&s;ing to be more affectation than it is reality.&mdash;I have invited her to Barrells; but when, or whether her affairs will permit her to come, I am ignorant.</P>
<P>Mr. Allen de&s;ired his compliments to you, when he left Barrells la&s;t Saturday; as did Mr. Hall, by a letter I received the po&s;t after (viz. Chri&s;tmas-day); expre&s;&s;ing his great hurry, perplexities, and uncertainty of the time of his return; all occa&s;ioned by the &s;udden death of the Bi&s;hop of Litchfield and Coven|try; by who&s;e order he went to his hou&s;e at ten o'clock on Friday morning to be examined
<PB N="173" REF="179">
(which he had already been at Lambeth); but <Q>&startq;Lo! (he &s;ays) the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf was called upon at Five the &s;ame morning, to &endq;be examined at a great and ju&s;t Tribunal:" &s;o that he mu&s;t go for the third time to Lambeth to get a new fiat; and, in &s;hort, be at much more trouble and expence by this unexpected accident.</Q> He adds, that he had &s;ecured a di&s;pen&s;ation before the Bi&s;hop's death; but I &s;uppo&s;e the holidays are al&s;o ob&s;tructions to the proceedings in the Courts.</P>
<P>I humbly beg Mrs. Emme's pardon for having once pre&s;umed to &s;ub&s;titute carrier pigeons in her place. She ought not, I confe&s;s, to have them &s;et up as rivals again&s;t her, &s;ince &s;he is as true to her tru&s;t as the doves can be, and as expeditious as Nature will allow her to be.</P>
<P>I cannot imagine how I could &s;uppo&s;e Mr. M&mdash; to mean Mr. Meredith; and I can le&s;s &s;uppo&s;e how Mr. Miller could make &s;o ab|&s;urd a compari&s;on about the Lea&s;owes and Hagley. Would it not have been &s;uffi|cient for him to have &s;poke the truth, by &s;aying the Lea&s;owes had more beauties than Hagley; and better u&s;e was made of the gifts of Nature, &s;uch as water-views, &amp;c. and have left &s;tructures out of the que&s;tion, which
<PB N="174" REF="180">
are owing to the pur&s;e more than to the ta&s;te; and with which you never pretended to vye? As to my&s;elf, I am not a&s;hamed to own that I like even a root-&s;eat at the Lea&s;owes better than I do his <HI>modern ruin</HI> of an <HI>ancient ca&s;tle</HI>; nor is it extraordinary. How many are there, be&s;ides my&s;elf, who&s;e eyes oblige them (without knowing why) to be more de|lighted with the Banquetting-hou&s;e at White|hall than with Blenheim Ca&s;tle, and with the front of Covent-Garden Church than with St. Paul's Cathedral!&mdash;Such is the force of truth, exemplified by that of proportion.</P>
<P>Lord Archer, &amp;c. dined here; and I dined and &s;upped at Umber&s;lade la&s;t week; and I be|lieve they go for London next week: As they come into Warwick&s;hire but every other year, I fear I &s;hall not have an opportunity of in|troducing you to his Lord&s;hip, nor him to you at the Lea&s;owes, before the year 1751: but if the weather proves favourable when you are here, I will carry you to &s;ee the hou&s;e and gardens any morning you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Now for the inexhau&s;tible topic of Urns. I approve greatly of your la&s;t urn, N^o. 5; which an&s;wers to the &s;hape and &s;implicity of what I wi&s;hed for, and will execute: and I agree with you in preferring two plinths to
<PB N="175" REF="181">
one. It remains then only to di&s;cu&s;s the one point, <HI>Decoration</HI>; in which point the placing the motto's are included. The <HI>His Saltem</HI> upon the upper plinth mu&s;t be undoubtedly; and I am much plea&s;ed, as is Mr. Allen, (a better judge than my&s;elf) with the <HI>Po&s;tquam t$ Fata</HI>, &amp;c. But we propo&s;e to you two things: <HI>his</HI> is, That, below where Mr. Somervile's name, &amp;c. is placed, &s;hould be added
<Q>"Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit."</Q>
But this he entirely &s;ubmits to you: only I think with him, that as the other motto re|gards him chiefly as a poet, this la&s;t will record him as a man who de&s;erved the e&s;teem of every good man; and was regretted accor|dingly. As to my own propo&s;al, I fear you will not like it: but you and I may both be in the right, in agreeing to the in&s;crip|tion's being in Engli&s;h&mdash;
<Q>"Sacred to the Memory of WILLIAM SOMERVILE, E&s;q."</Q>
$t may be uncu&s;tomary; but a woman may $e privileged to &s;werve from &s;uch rules as $e may be &s;uppo&s;ed not to under&s;tand: and $ will better plea&s;e the generality of his and $$y common acquaintance, as well as the mob,
<PB N="176" REF="182">
whom you call your friends. There will be le&s;s affectation in it, and will more become me. As al&s;o, to have the whole &s;eem plain, and not co&s;tly. And al&s;o, the rea&s;on of my erecting it, to be as plainly under&s;tood to mean no more than my e&s;teem for him as a worthy Man and a good Poet, who had honoured me with his friend&s;hip: but I would ward again&s;t the <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>cen&s;orious</HI>, who might be capable of forging &s;everal &s;uch ridiculous rea|&s;ons (notwith&s;tanding his age and every other circum&s;tance) that might draw on a reproach upon me for paying this tribute to his me|mory; and although I am in no &s;ort afraid of unju&s;t cen&s;ure, yet I have &s;uffered too much by it not to be cautious.&mdash;As I have taken the liberty to give you this hint in a friendly way, I am almo&s;t &s;ure you will willingly agree with me to leave out garlands of flow|ers, &amp;c. and (exclu&s;ive of the rea&s;on above|mentioned) I am charmed with your thought of alluding to the Chace; which you very ju&s;tly &s;ay <HI>would be the mo&s;t proper ornament</HI>, a <HI>Wreath</HI> and <HI>French-Horn:</HI> but then you &s;ay, <HI>you give it up, becau&s;e you cannot manage it well</HI>&punc; I know you could; and I &s;ee &s;ome rough$ &s;ketches on the back of your paper, which
<PB N="177" REF="183">
do not di&s;plea&s;e me. Permit me to a&s;k, Would it be ami&s;s (though draw <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> it I cannot) to have a French-Horn &s;u&s;pended from the bottom of the mouldings of the up|per part of the pede&s;tal by a riband, and two branches of laurel to be cro&s;&s;ed through it, turned upwards, &s;o as to form three parts of a wreath? Nobody but your&s;elf could ever be &s;uppo&s;ed to comprehend &s;uch a &s;crawl as this; and yet I dare &s;ay, you will comprehend my meaning, and then throw it into the fire, as I reque&s;t. If after the&s;e hints you will allow the motto's, as well as the in&s;cription, to be all in the front (the urn being plain) I think the whole will be fixed: but here you will have the trouble to draw the wreath and horn afre&s;h. But I do not a&s;k pardon for giving it you, as it is not meant to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in adorning my farm, but in paying due honours to our decea&s;ed friend; who is as much la|mented by you as by my&s;elf.</P>
<P>You will receive this on New-year's-day I &s;uppo&s;e: may it be propitious to you! and
<PB N="178" REF="184">
&s;o may every &s;ucceeding year! This wi&s;h is unlimited; &s;o is my e&s;teem and friend&s;hip for you. Need I add that I am</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your obliged humble &s;ervant, H. LUXBOROUGH?</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>Pray either come and &s;urprize me, or el&s;e let me know when you will come, by the fir&s;t opportunity.&mdash;I forgot to mention that our intended &s;ituation for the urn will not &s;hew any ornament or in&s;cription, except &s;uch as are in front; &s;o that they will be needle&s;s: and as we have agreed the urn &s;hall be plain, the fewer ornaments upon the pede&s;tal, the better. But I cannot forbear thinking, as there are two plinths to &s;upport the urn be&s;ides the pede&s;tal, the whole propo&s;ed &s;cheme might be executed on the one &s;ide; that is, on the front of the pede&s;tal.&mdash;Where do you get your thick gilt paper? Mine is tran&s;parent.</P>
<P>N^o. 1. I think the fi&s;tula &s;u&s;pended has a good effect <HI>hanging to the wreath</HI>. N^o. 2, 3, are very proper, (e&s;pecially that without the lyre) in ca&s;e a circular wreath is admitted. N^o. 4. The proportion to my eye is agreeable; as I dare &s;ay it is to the ju&s;tne&s;s of the com|po&s;ite order. N^o. 5. The proportion of the Corinthian pede&s;tal does not plea&s;e me equal|ly;
<PB N="179" REF="185">
but I am (perhaps for want of &s;kill) prejudiced again&s;t that order. The medallion I like much, and think it an ornament greatly in ta&s;te; but it will be difficult to get &s;uch a thing executed, and more &s;o to pre&s;erve it from mo&s;s, which would di&s;gui&s;e the features. Yet, had a bu&s;t been made of him, as was propo&s;ed by Richard&s;on, I would have had the medallion done from it, and have liked it better than any thing el&s;e. N^o. 6. (This is &s;ent to Warwick) I think this the prettie&s;t &s;hape for the urn; and it mo&s;t re&s;embles tho&s;e little ones the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et turned in wood for me; which &s;he copied from an antique urn brought her by the Counte&s;s of Pomfret from Italy. I &s;end one of them for you to look at. N^o. 7. This is undoubtedly the front view I prefer as to ornament; but do not like the &s;hape of the urn for the rea&s;on you give. N^o. 8. This mantling is very well, (e&s;pecially that with flowerets) in ca&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary to have any thing on tho&s;e &s;ides of the urn that are not in front.&mdash;Query, Whether the wreath left entirely out of the laurel-pede&s;tal, and the laurel-&s;prig added to the fi&s;tula and tibia (as in N^o. 5, of the <HI>fir&s;t drawings</HI>) might not be as well; but placed &s;omething higher on the urn, and not &s;u&s;|pended;
<PB N="180" REF="186">
as there will be in this ca&s;e (of a plain urn) no wreath to hang it to?&mdash;I &s;hould like the whole to be as plain as po&s;&s;ible: that is to &s;ay, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with ex|pre&s;&s;ing my friend&s;hip for Mr. Somervile, and his poetical genius; trophies of which mu&s;t undoubtedly be on one &s;ide the urn: but all the re&s;t would be as mere ornament to the work and to the place, which is in no &s;ort my intention. Neither would I have it expen|&s;ive (for more rea&s;ons than barely that of &s;a|ving money); but I would expre&s;s with as much &s;implicity as po&s;&s;ible my re&s;pect for his memory, without flattery or pomp; and that it was my friend&s;hip only which made me rai&s;e this memorandum of him: &s;o that my fir&s;t thought of all was only to have had an altar, without any urn, and &s;omething wrote upon it equivalent to what you have put round the blazing altar you drew out in your letter, viz. <HI>Sacred to Friend&s;hip</HI>; or to that ef|fect. But as an urn will undoubtedly be hand&s;ome, I am, upon the whole, for having an exceeding plain one, in as ju&s;t &s;ymmetry as po&s;&s;ible; and on one &s;ide, only &s;ome proper trophy to him, &s;uch as the tibia and fi&s;tula only; and the laurel on the pede&s;tal to in|clo&s;e his name, &amp;c.&mdash;The places you pro|po&s;e
<PB N="181" REF="187">
for the other motto's on the plinths, are very proper; and nothing can be more pro|per than the <HI>His Saltem</HI> and the <HI>Po&s;tquam</HI>, &amp;c. unle&s;s one could have found one in his own Works, which was &s;uitable, and good at the &s;ame time; which I confe&s;s I do not find in tho&s;e I have &s;een of his. Outing's memory (which is a good one) had not recorded any: for which rea&s;on, when the thing was &s;poken of, he &s;aid there&punc; mu&s;t be a Latin one; and de&s;ired me to advi&s;e with you; and men|tioned none him&s;elf, but <HI>His &s;altem accumulem donis</HI>, &amp;c. and was for having an altar orna|mented with flowers, &amp;c. be&s;ides the urn: but of all this he &s;poke to you before, without my knowledge.&mdash;So, as to my pre&s;ent plain &s;cheme, agreeable to the form and method you &s;eem to approve, and to the motto's you cho&s;e, I beg the favour you will draw one more, and it &s;hall be executed, provided you will further promi&s;e to come and direct where it &s;hall be placed; that is, on which &s;pot,

(as him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it): for the double oak &s;hall be his canopy; unle&s;s you change your opinion and mine.</P>

to <HI>&s;trawberries, acorns, artichokes</HI>, or any ve|getable that I have hitherto &s;een, for the han|dle of any va&s;e or urn; and had rather have none, or at mo&s;t a &s;mall round nob on the top of the cover, &s;uch as you have given to N^o. 6; which, as I mentioned before, is &s;ent to Warwick.</P>

<P>IF either of us regarded ceremony, I &s;hould wait till I had the plea&s;ure of hearing from you, before I troubled you with re|newing our corre&s;pondence; and then I &s;hould endeavour to expre&s;s how much joy your company here had given me, and how much regret your ab&s;ence had cau&s;ed me. But as I always &s;uppo&s;e, when the rays of friend&s;hip appear, ceremony vani&s;hes, I take it for grant|ed, you will u&s;e none of it with me, nor expect any from me: It is but a vapour.&mdash;This point &s;ettled, I mu&s;t tell you that I have been more than nine days (the common period, confined with a cold; and, very happily for

<P>Not the &s;elf-flattery of J&mdash; G&mdash;&mdash; C&mdash;&mdash;, junior, E&s;q. in his Preface to the Life of Socrates, nor his &s;mart &s;courges of great men in his Notes, have awakened me enough to read all his book; but I will do it &s;oon, as your very ju&s;t remarks in the margin carry me agreeably through the road which this young Biographer &s;eems to have &s;own with nettles: but as he rai&s;es him&s;elf upon that bank, I wi&s;h they do not &s;ting him when they come to maturity.</P>
<P>I &s;end you a letter of the Duche&s;s of So|mer&s;et's; which I de&s;ire you will return as &s;oon as you have read it: for till then I can|not an&s;wer it.&mdash;That &s;he &s;hould agree in liking all you write, I do not wonder; but am not a little proud of having cho&s;e out a poem of yours to &s;end her, which plea&s;es both Her Grace and her chaplain. For though it would &s;tand the te&s;t of all the Duche&s;&s;es and their chaplains in England, yet that <HI>my</HI> Duche&s;s

<P>You left your&s;elf in &s;afe hands, when you intru&s;ted me with &s;everal things of your writ|ing: for all tho&s;e you called incorrect, or did not commi&s;&s;ion me to &s;hew, I never did; though, according to my own opinion, I might have done it without offence to your Mu&s;e: but it would have been an offence to you; and friend&s;hip is with me &s;acred.</P>
<P>This is wrote on the paper you was &s;o kind to give me; but with the wor&s;t of pens. Take pity of me; and let Aris at Birmingham know that you de&s;ire, if I &s;end to him for any thing in his way, you would have him &s;erve me as he does you. I &s;hall reap the benefit of this, and you will have &s;ome of the glean|ings.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you, that my &s;trict obedience to your commands has nearly incurred di&s;plea&s;ure from Mr. Outing; to whom I wrote upon bu&s;ine&s;s (and was obliged to &s;end to Somerviles-A&s;ton on purpo&s;e); and in my letter &s;aid you would have gone there from hence, but that my&s;elf and my &s;ervants had told you they believed the hou&s;e was filled with friends of Mr. Reynalds's from Montgomery; and that hearing he was gone

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EVERY day brings us &s;trong and fre&s;h proofs of the folly of being &s;olicitous after grandeur, riches, power, or indeed after any other earthly ble&s;&s;ing; which is &s;natched from us as &s;oon as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.&mdash;You gue&s;s that the death of the Duke of Somer&s;et cau&s;es my pre&s;ent reflection; which millions of things might daily oblige one to make, and &s;till give greater cau&s;e for. The death of a man of &s;ixty-&s;ix, who has been tormented many years with the gout, cannot be deemed an uncommon or unexpected event: and yet I confe&s;s it &s;urprized me when I received the news, near as much as when I received that of the death of his Son, Lord Beauchamp. The e&s;teem I had for His Grace, and the friend&s;hip I have, and have long had, for his Duche&s;s, could not let me hear of his death without &s;hedding tears of regret: and the ac|count
<PB N="187" REF="193">
&s;he gives me of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his health in her letter of the 21&s;t ult. cau&s;es my being &s;o much &s;urprized at its happening thus &s;uddenly. And as every trifling circum|&s;tance increa&s;es the perturbation of thought upon &s;uch occa&s;ions; &s;o did my happening to be &s;ealing up a letter of congratulation and directing it to Lady Betty Smith&s;on upon the birth of a &s;on, ju&s;t as the po&s;t-letters and news-papers were brought in, which I chanced to ca&s;t my eye upon, and immediately &s;aw the article, which rather demanded condolence than congratulation from me; and would have made my letter very unwelcome, and the more improper as &s;he lies-in, and that po&s;|&s;ibly Sir Hugh (now Earl of Northumberland) might not have cho&s;e &s;he &s;hould receive any, le&s;t they might move her pa&s;&s;ions in her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances. This <HI>faux-pas</HI> however I e&s;caped, and threw my letter in the fire, with one I had intended for the Duche&s;s; wherein I promi&s;ed to &s;end her the Ode you honoured me with after your illne&s;s; and introduced your intention of getting acquainted with Mr. Lind&s;ey the Duke's chaplain; which I ex|pre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, as to make her un|der&s;tand that you meant it as a &s;tep towards an introduction to Her Grace: But what avails
<PB N="188" REF="194">
it now? <HI>"L'homme propo&s;e et Dieu di&s;po&s;e"</HI> as the French Proverb &s;ays.</P>
<P>Outing got to Town on Monday &s;evennight, in thunder, lightning, and in rain, and was welcomed by an earthquake the Thur&s;day after.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t Mi&s;s Meredith is to be marri|ed, the 23d in&s;tant, to Mr. Banks of Win|&s;tanley in Lanca&s;hire, her relation, (a &s;econd-cou&s;in to the Duke of Somer&s;et) who&s;e e&s;tate is 2,300<HI>l.</HI> per annum: but, far above all, is a man of &s;trict honour, benevolence, and good nature, and ho&s;pitable to the greate&s;t degree; and his propo&s;als to her, generous to as great a one. Had it not been for this event, Mr. Meredith would be now here: he is with her in that country; the re&s;t of the family are at London. I had a letter from him upon the occa&s;ion, which &s;hews his joy; and I will im|part it to you when I &s;ee you and the ro&s;es appear together in my Shrubbery: for you know they take it ill you have never yet vi&s;ited them. The humble violet would be &s;till more glad to receive you; but &s;carcely dares propo&s;e it.</P>
<P>I am almo&s;t angry at Lord Stamford for vi|&s;iting your Walks at &s;uch an un&s;ea&s;onable time: it was quite wrong-headed; but I hope he and
<PB N="189" REF="195">
his Lady will &s;ee them in &s;ummer. Do they live near you? I wi&s;h I could meet her there. She is a woman of excellent &s;en&s;e, and a great admirer of the beauties of nature; which &s;he will &s;ee to the be&s;t advantage in your envi|rons.&mdash;I agree with you as to the wreath round the French-Horn; and have be&s;poke it.</P>
<P>You are &s;o far from being cen&s;orious, as to Mr. Miller's place, that your de&s;cription gives me an infinitely more advantageous idea of it, than any I had conceived before from what others had &s;aid to me of it. Undoubt|edly advantages might be taken from the view he has on the &s;pot where Edgehill battle was fought; but the memorandums rai&s;ed there mu&s;t proceed from a genius &s;ome|thing more &s;ublime than that which &s;eems merely turned to Gothic architecture. Many a man can &s;ketch out a bow-window or heavy ca&s;tle, who is unacquainted with the beauties of a genteel urn: but many more people could do the one and the other more ea&s;ily than dedicate it properly, and impre&s;s &s;uch ideas as the hi&s;tory and the place might &s;ug|ge&s;t to tho&s;e of a more refined though le&s;s mechanical genius than I conceive him to be of. You could ea&s;ily a&s;&s;i&s;t him, if you thought it worth your while to give your advice;
<PB N="190" REF="196">
yet beware of advi&s;ing him to remove re|mains of monuments, or even a &s;ingle &s;tone from the church-yard. The par&s;ons would call it &s;acrilege, and cut up his woods as they did yours; perhaps pull down his <HI>lofty</HI> tower, and you would trepan him into this.</P>
<P>I have ended four &s;ides before I was aware of it; but you will know it too well: and now I mu&s;t add, that I do not yet know what to &s;ay about the in&s;cription to the urn. Mr. Allen is va&s;tly again&s;t its being in Engli&s;h; and I am al&s;o inclinable to give that up, unle&s;s it might be allowable to let the pro&s;e be &s;o, and the motto Latin, as a quotation: but accord|ing to your letter, I find it is again&s;t rule, if rules there be in <HI>Urnary</HI>.&mdash;I liked your fir&s;t thought; and the motto you pitch upon, viz. <HI>Po&s;tquam</HI>, &amp;c. and have no fault to find with it now, but that it gives an idea of Mr. So|mervile, merely as a poet. Is it impo&s;&s;ible to put the intended Engli&s;h in&s;cription, or at lea&s;t what is adequate to it, into Latin within the wreath, retaining al&s;o the abovementioned motto? I am &s;ure you could do it well; and verily believe you would be glad to do it for the &s;ake of your decea&s;ed Friend, and of</P>

<P>BY the inclo&s;ed, you will find the Urn is fini&s;hed; and I am to fix a day for &s;end|ing my team for it. The in&s;cription being undetermined, &s;tops me: for I think it would be better done at Warwick than it can be by the fools at Henley; and I would order it &s;o, as to give them only one day to write it, and &s;end for it the next.&mdash;By my la&s;t letter to you, I mentioned the in&s;cription's being in Latin; and hoped you would think of &s;omething which might tran&s;mit to po&s;terity an idea of Mr. Somervile in his private character, as well as you have &s;hewn his capacity as a poet, by the Latin motto you propo&s;ed, and by the emblematical ornament on the pede&s;tal, as Author of the <HI>Chace</HI>, and as a lover of hunt|ing.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOT having &s;een Mr. Allen &s;ince I re|ceived yours, I defer an an&s;wer to the query about the in&s;cription. I am not a pro|per per&s;on to decide; but am inclinable to the alteration you mention, as it will take away the objection to the two motto's pro|po&s;ed coming together.&mdash;The urn was erected this morning, and now makes a good figure under its canopy of oak. If the weather continues dry, it will be fit to be painted in a fortnight: and the man who &s;et it up will come at the &s;ame time to in&s;cribe it. The letters are to be carved in the &s;tone, and then blacked. Collins, who made it, does all Lord Brook's and Mr. Wi&s;e's work; and his foreman appears to be a good workman. The French-horn, wreathed with laurel, was done by the be&s;t &s;tone-carver in Warwick. All this is good.&mdash;Now for the bad. Fir&s;t of all, the &s;haft is not all in one piece. I a&s;ked the man the rea&s;on, and he prote&s;ts he could not get a &s;tone of that &s;ize in Warwick: that he tried every quarry, and went purpo&s;ely to the principal one; but in vain. So there are two pieces of five inches each, one above, the other
<PB N="194" REF="200">
below the wreath, which hangs on a hoop not &s;u&s;pended by a riband. The next misfortune is owing to a mercenary, ill-natured ra&s;cal, who is a weekly carrier from Henley to War|wick; by whom I &s;ent a letter la&s;t Saturday to Mr. Hands, to &s;ay that I would &s;end my team for the va&s;e and pede&s;tal on Monday: but, if Mr. Collins did not choo&s;e that day, de&s;ired he would name another. Mr. Hands was not at home; but his people &s;ent the fellow to Mr. Collins, who told him by word of mouth, that the team mu&s;t not come till Wedne&s;day; for the things could not be &s;ent &s;afely before: which me&s;&s;age the ra&s;cal never brought, nor ever mentioned to my &s;ervants, though he &s;aw four of them on Sun|day at Henley, and &s;poke to two of them. If it had been wrote down, he would have brought it, and demanded Three-pence at lea&s;t for it; but as it was verbal, he did not think it worth delivering. So when the team got to War|wick on Monday, Mr. Hands &s;wore; Mr. Collins fretted: both &s;aid the urn would be damaged; for they had be&s;poke ca&s;es of deal for every di&s;tinct part, and but one ca&s;e was made; yet to &s;end the waggon back empty they did not dare: &s;o, in &s;hort, they packed it all up as carefully as they could.
<PB N="195" REF="201">
But the roads being very rough and bad, they with difficulty got home by One in the morning; the mouth of the French-horn &s;truck off, and two &s;tones broke off the lower plinth, and a &s;mall notch on the urn, and one on the cap of it, but trifling. The foreman and another man came in the morn|ing and mended the two &s;tones very well (as I had &s;ome of the &s;ame &s;tone in the rough); and have put the mouth of the French-horn on again (for luckily it was not lo&s;t); and they &s;ay it is as &s;trong as ever, and the paint will hide entirely the piecing.</P>
<P>I was very well entertained on Sunday even|ing, and on Monday till Five in the evening, with Mr. Smith's company. He brought me the Prints I had &s;ub&s;cribed to. I al&s;o &s;ub|&s;cribed to four, which he intends to put out; and I bought of him four others, and al&s;o the eight Derby&s;hire Views; and he gave me one of Chat&s;worth; and would have given me a whole &s;ett, if I would have accepted it. Mr. Hall &s;aw him here, and has &s;ub&s;cribed to his new &s;ett. He promi&s;es me the little book with Virgil's Grove, at the time he deli|vers the others.&mdash;Would but the Green Book come too, I &s;hould be completely happy!&mdash;We talked much of you. He is charmed with
<PB N="196" REF="202">
your ta&s;te, and with the Lea&s;owes; and would be more charmed with you, if you would have &s;hewn him any of your writings: but he &s;ays you u&s;ed him ill in that point; for he has &s;een only what is in print. He got up at Seven, and walked all over this place; and again with me, when I aro&s;e. He commends it more than I think it de&s;erves. He agrees with you entirely in admiring the amphitheatre of wooded hills that we &s;ee from the windows, and the &s;ituation of the Hermitage; which he thinks preferable to any in England. He la|ments my want of water; but thinks I might find &s;prings (as indeed mo&s;t people do). He liked the &s;hell-urns, and the &s;ituation for the new one; as al&s;o the a&s;pect of the kitchen-garden, and the pond and oak-tree; and agrees to moving the pales, &s;o as to guide one to the Shrubbery. The gloomine&s;s of the night &s;hewed the Long Walk to advantage, with the moon ju&s;t &s;een through the trees on Sun|day, when he came by my coach-&s;ide from Henley; and he was delighted with the Go|thic arch they form: but he is again&s;t plant|ing the Service-Walk bank with flowers, or doing any thing to it; thinking its roughne&s;s is a good contra&s;t to divide the Shrubbery from the Coppice, which is al&s;o a kind of
<PB N="197" REF="203">
&s;hrubbery. He is al&s;o again&s;t my painting the niche where Venus is: for he &s;ays &s;he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been bathing, and to crouch her&s;elf in that manner, upon the approach of &s;omebody, by way of hiding her&s;elf: and he would have the niche adorned with mo&s;s, &amp;c. like &s;ome bathing place in a remote cor|ner; and (he &s;ays) &s;ome bits of looking-gla&s;s among it to reflect what is to be &s;een, and al&s;o to give a watery look at a di&s;tance, will have a good effect from the Hall-door. He is much for the pediment; to which my only objection is the price. He is much plea&s;ed with the place where you have &s;et your urn; but thinks, as you do, that it looks too &s;mall from where it is mo&s;t &s;een.&mdash;I have begun the Ha!Ha! acro&s;s the Service Walk; and the urn is &s;een from every place, Shrubbery, Ter|race, Bowling-green, Long Walk, and the End of the Kitchen-garden; which is to be ta|ken in.</P>
<P>I &s;end you half the je&s;&s;amine-water I have left; and will write to a&s;k Mrs. Wymonde&s;old, if it is to be bought at London.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e Mr. Meredith's two la&s;t letters. I hope you will meet him here; and that we &s;hall pour libations together over Mr. So|mervile's urn. But will you not come be|&s;ides,

<P>THAT the interruption to our corre|&s;pondence &s;hould happen on my &s;ide, I blu&s;h at, though I well know it was not my fault. I wi&s;h you could know it as well; for you could not then blame me. But if you are inclined to blame me, pray con&s;ider that I have been &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed already, by being deprived of your letters, which I greatly e&s;teem. I mu&s;t have been my own enemy,
<PB N="199" REF="205">
had I deprived my&s;elf of them willingly. The truth is, that when your la&s;t letter came, I had company, who &s;taid a week (Sir Peter Soame, the Con&s;ul of O&s;tend, and Mr. Allen); and you know I have nobody to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in doing the honours of my hou&s;e. At that juncture of time I received the news of Lady Boling|broke's death; of my Brother's va&s;t affliction for her, and of his own indi&s;po&s;ition: All which obliged me to &s;end a &s;ervant expre&s;s to Lon|don, and to offer to go my&s;elf; which if my brother had accepted, I would have &s;et out immediately: &s;o that I had the journey in &s;ome mea&s;ure to prepare for, and a great many let|ters to write by the me&s;&s;enger I &s;ent; &s;ince who&s;e return an accident happened among my dome&s;tics, which &s;hocked me, and cau&s;ed me a good deal of trouble and thought. Diabo|lical weather, added to all this, lowered my &s;pirits yet more, and &s;olitude contributed to my dulne&s;s. Judge then, Sir, whether I was &s;it to write to you; I, who in my brighte&s;t moments am unequal to the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>I &s;ee with plea&s;ure the advancement of Spring; but though its progre&s;s has been quick, there are few flowers, except the lilac: the woodbine begins to &s;hew it&s;elf, and the
<PB N="200" REF="206">
&s;weet-briar is fragrant: but I fear there is not quite &s;tability enough in the wea|ther, nor variety enough in the Shrubbery to invite you as yet; but there will be ere long. The Coppice has the advantage at pre|&s;ent; for Nature has embroidered it thick with all kinds of wild flowers. The Hermitage looks ruinous, the roof being pulled to pieces, in or|der to have it thatched; without which I &s;hall never keep the wet out: but it &s;hall be covered &s;peedily. I have not yet had time to fill up the Walk, which you know I had ungravelled; nor to ungravel the middle one, as you advi&s;ed: but it &s;hall be done. As to the urn, I told you it was erected: if dry weather continues, I will have it painted next week. As the motto Mr. Allen cho&s;e, and that you had cho&s;e, can|not, in your opinion, be on each &s;ide the &s;ame plinth; and as neither of them &s;ingly take in both the moral and the poetical character of Mr. Somervile, nor my friend&s;hip, I &s;earched Francis's Horace, with a view to find <HI>one</HI> only, that &s;hould expre&s;s in &s;ome mea&s;ure the whole; and Mr. John Reynalds happening to come in, looked over it with me, and we both hit upon a &s;hort one, which to my thinking an&s;wers the intent, and will not oblige me to write any
<PB N="201" REF="207">
other on the &s;ides. As the forepart of the pede&s;tal only is adorned with carving, I think it is be&s;t to have no writing but on the front. The motto is

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IMAGINE you receive this from the Ely|&s;ian Shades, where it is next to a miracle but I had been, in&s;tead of writing to you from my parlour; which act is contrary to the rules of chirurgery, and is full as much as I can execute in this &s;crawling fa&s;hion. But I was re&s;olved to attempt for the fir&s;t time what mo&s;t people would have been unable to per|form in &s;ix months: whereas it will not be a fortnight till to-morrow morning, &s;ince I had a fall in my chamber, in getting out of bed: which, by the circum&s;tances of it, mu&s;t have
<PB N="204" REF="210">
proved fatal, had I not been re&s;erved by Fate for &s;ome other end, which I am as yet a &s;tran|ger to. The goodne&s;s of my con&s;titution pre|vented any humour falling to the parts affected, and I had very little fever. Young Mr. Holyoak the Surgeon has proceeded in &s;o &s;kilful, and yet &s;o precipitate a manner, that my plai&s;ters are already reduced from eight or nine to two only: one over my eye, which will perhaps be &s;carred, and one ju&s;t above my knee, where <HI>the lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance</HI> (as they call it) makes it longer in curing. <HI>New fle&s;h</HI> mu&s;t grow there, and <HI>new &s;kin</HI> on my face: but he has treated me in the French way, and u&s;ed no lenitives, nor kept my eye bound up longer than till it could open. I have been tractable and in &s;pirits; and am now allowed to go once in the middle of the day to the Hermitage; where I hope to receive you about <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion Week</HI>: for I fear &s;everal of the flower|ing-&s;hrubs will be gone off if you defer it longer, and I long to have you &s;ee it in full bloom.</P>
<P>The oaks are quite green here; and the urn is painted, and the motto and whole in&s;cription were carved the day before I received your letter (which did not come till Friday, though it was wrote on Sun|day);
<PB N="205" REF="211">
and I did not know how to detain the &s;tone-carver, who came purpo&s;ely from Warwick.&mdash;I have not &s;een Mr. Allen or Mr. Hall to &s;hew your motto's to; but will do &s;o the fir&s;t opportunity. In the mean time, let me beg you to make u&s;e of the fir&s;t (mean|ing your own Engli&s;h one), which I am charmed with; and think I can an&s;wer that our friend Mr. Somervile will be &s;o, if any intel|ligent &s;pirit is allowed to advi&s;e him of it.&mdash; Adieu.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS letter goes by &s;ome colliers belong|ing to Hale&s;owen, who pretend to be well acquainted with the Lea&s;owes. I hope it will reach you; which I much fear my la&s;t did not, as I wrote it near three weeks ago, to acquaint you of a very terrible fall which I had had; and to de&s;ire your company here the <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion Week</HI>, le&s;t the blo&s;&s;oms of the Shrub|bery &s;hould be gone if you deferred your vi&s;it: &s;ince which time I have daily expected you; and the flowers have ha&s;tened more than u&s;ual to di&s;play their beauties, which are con&s;e|quently nearer decay: &s;o that I hope you will not po&s;tpone the vi&s;it you promi&s;ed to my garden, till it is &s;tripped of its ornaments. As to your vi&s;it to me, it is agreeable in every &s;ea&s;on; and I remember with gratitude, that you have given me your company, when every body le&s;s friendly was afraid to peep out of their door.&mdash;I would have returned you the in&s;criptions directly after my letter, had I not &s;uppo&s;ed you would be here before they could

get to you. I never have &s;een Mr. Allen but once &s;ince I received them, and that in a hurry. Mr. Hall I have &s;een twice, and he explained mo&s;t of them in Engli&s;h, and &s;eemed to like them well; but was both times in a hurry al&s;o: &s;o that I could not po&s;&s;ibly form, from their tran&s;lation, a judgment which of the La|tin ones I &s;hould prefer; neither am I capa|ble of it otherwi&s;e; but am almo&s;t &s;ure I &s;hall approve that which you fix upon. This is owing to my vanity I confe&s;s, which makes me believe that my judgment will tally with yours: for if it did not, my &s;incerity would force me to own it, as it obliges me now to a&s;&s;ure you, that I am, Sir,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAD I not expected your &s;ervant to come for the gee&s;e, I &s;hould have wrote by the u&s;ual conveyance, to thank you for your la&s;t agreeable and kind vi&s;it. I am glad you liked the road by which you returned home. It is in part the &s;ame as Outing and I went once to the Lea&s;owes: but if a vehicle (that is not for the waggon track) could go all the way you rode, it would bring us much nearer to|gether than we are: however, your kind invi|tation to me to &s;tay three or four days with you obviates all objections concerning length of way: therefore, &s;ince you will be troubled with my company, you may depend upon it in July; and as early as I po&s;&s;ibly can in that month. I dare not name a day yet, for fear of di&s;ap|pointment, e&s;pecially as my hay-making is not begun; but I could wi&s;h to go about the 17th.&mdash;As you are building and altering, the accommodation may not be in the order you would wi&s;h it; but you may depend upon my being exceeding well plea&s;ed with it: cere|mony is no more my ta&s;te than it is yours. I
<PB N="209" REF="215">
am glad the Duche&s;s and her train behaved without any &s;hew of it, when they vi&s;ited you and your environs; with which I make no doubt but they were plea&s;ed. I love Colonel Lyttelton for wanting to give you their &s;hell|urn, which would have a good effect on many &s;pots of the Lea&s;owes; and is I think very ill placed in their garden. I hope Mi&s;s Lyt|telton will get you the &s;mall &s;tatue and the old Abbey-windows; which Abbey (with your permi&s;&s;ion) I intend to vi&s;it; as al&s;o Lord Dudley's Green-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Hall came here Ye&s;terday, and is this moment returned to Harborough; but left his compliments to you in charge with me; and &s;ays he will not fail to vi&s;it you &s;ome afternoon: but I believe his vi&s;it will &s;carcely be confined to &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time.&mdash;Nanny is highly plea&s;ed that &s;he is to go with me to the Lea|&s;owes: perhaps Mr. Hall may meet me there; and that will be all my train the fir&s;t vi&s;it. As to the &s;econd, Mr. and Mrs. Wymonde&s;old will I hope be here, and Mrs. Davies, who is to &s;pend the &s;ummer in the country with them. Colonel Hilde&s;ley (a relation of mine) talks al&s;o of coming. If you let us go to the Lea&s;owes, I propo&s;e lying at Birmingham, that we may &s;tay the later with you.&mdash;You &s;ee
<PB N="210" REF="216">
how ready I am to accept of invitations which promi&s;e me &s;o much plea&s;ure as that of your company in your beautiful Walks: &s;o that you would do well to be cautious how you lay &s;uch temptations in my way, le&s;t I &s;hould cau&s;e you to repent, by troubling you too often.&mdash;I hope the Bi&s;hop and the Baronet will treat the Par&s;on as his u&s;age in regard to you de&s;erves.</P>
<P>I thank you &s;incerely for your advice with re&s;pect to my improvements here; and am &s;en|&s;ible all the things you mention are wanting. I had already mentioned to a carpenter my in|tention of having &s;ome garden-&s;kreens made; which will be deferred no longer than till the wood is thought to be &s;ufficiently &s;ea&s;oned.&mdash; The day after you left me, I fini&s;hed the apart|ment of the urn, all but turfing; that &s;hall be done when the &s;ky plea&s;es to pour forth &s;howers to moi&s;ten the earth: but for that I mu&s;t not pray till my hay is in. &mdash; I have turned the Path in the Coppice towards the Bank, where a &s;eat is propo&s;ed above the Pit; and have filled up the place, where we did turn in before, with trees, and have put the white bench, which did &s;tand on the Bank, into the corner; from whence one has a view of Skiltz; and the urn looks al&s;o Well from it. I have
<PB N="211" REF="217">
al&s;o made another opening in the Long Walk, and am thinning the branches of the trees that lead to the Old Orchard; &s;o that I now di&s;cover three little edifices, be&s;ides Oldborough Church, through the trees.</P>
<P>I return thanks for Swift's Works. The fertility of his imagination cannot tire. I &s;end you the Conque&s;t of Mexico, in French; and think it entertaining. I al&s;o &s;end Voltaire's Tragedies, that you may read his <HI>Alzire</HI> before I &s;ee you; and I will put Mr. Somervile's Tran&s;lation of it in my pocket, to read with you at the Lea&s;owes.&mdash;Your &s;tile is always plea&s;ing to me, whether you write at different periods, or otherwi&s;e. I confe&s;s, this la&s;t way, which makes a little journal, is the more agree|able, becau&s;e it imitates conver&s;ation, and makes one fancy one's &s;elf upon the place, and in the company de&s;cribed.&mdash;You could not, Sir, have &s;aid any thing more flattering to me, than that <HI>there is a re&s;emblance between my imagination and yours</HI>. It would be too vain in me to own that I think &s;o; but I may &s;ay with truth, that there is a great &s;imilitude in our way of life, and our &s;olitary amu&s;ements; and <HI>that</HI> may al&s;o cau&s;e a re&s;emblance in our turn of thought. Whenever mine tallies with yours, I &s;hall conclude I am right, and be
<PB N="212" REF="218">
proud of it. For example, I am as plea&s;ed as you are to have people of ta&s;te &s;ee my improvements here, and take a plea&s;ure in hearing them commended; and am glad when Chance &s;ends &s;uch per&s;ons here: and my friend&s;hip for you makes me al&s;o glad to hear when they go to the Lea&s;owes: but I &s;hould not like to have it a &s;hew for the Public in general, as Lord Cobham's; of which every body tires.&mdash;Your neighbourhood to Hagley will often cau&s;e you to have good company drop in at the Lea&s;owes; and tho&s;e who have once &s;een it, will wi&s;h to &s;ee it often: nor do the beauties of Hagley in the lea&s;t ob&s;cure tho&s;e of your place. Proceed, Sir, in your &s;chemes, which will diffu&s;e plea&s;ure around you, as well as give plea&s;ure to your&s;elf. But I would not have you (nor would I my&s;elf, though we were ever &s;o rich) execute our &s;chemes all at once: for I think there is more joy in forming the plan and &s;eeing it grow by degrees towards perfection, than there is in &s;eeing it perfect.</P>
<P>I &s;end you a Goo&s;e, a Gander, a Mallard, two Ducks, and a rumpled Egg-Shell. This rural tribute Barrells humbly pays to its Lord <HI>the Lea&s;owes</HI>; where by the care of good Mrs. Arnold the fowl cannot fail to pro&s;per. &mdash;

<P>THE bearer (Mr. Moore of Warwick, Plai&s;terer) is going to Sir Thomas Lyttelton's, for whom he has done a great deal of &s;tucco-work; and is to do more. He al&s;o did the in&s;ide of Lord Archer's &s;ummer-hou&s;e, and of mine, when he worked for Mr. Wright: but he is now &s;et up for him&s;elf; and has mended my figure of Milton &s;o well, (though it was broke in a thou&s;and pieces, and a hand and arm lo&s;t) that I &s;hall employ him further.

He is de&s;irous of &s;eeing the Lea&s;owes, and of offering you his &s;ervice: &s;o that I have wrote this letter to oblige him; as al&s;o to de&s;ire you will let him &s;ee your white Bu&s;t of Pope; for I have a mind to have Lord Bolingbroke's painted the &s;ame.

<P>MR. Williams appears in my parlour very opportunely, as I wanted a convey|ance for my an&s;wer to the letter you la&s;t fa|voured me with; and he tells me he intends waiting upon you the end of this week. I de&s;ired him not to forget to look at your Bu&s;t of Pope; hoping he may be able to paint mine of my Brother Bolingbroke after the &s;ame manner. I envy him the plea&s;ure he will have at the Lea&s;owes, whil&s;t I am chained down here in (hitherto fruitle&s;s) expectation of Mr. Outing and the Lawyer Mr. Woolfe, who is to come with him: and when I &s;hall be re|lea&s;ed God only knows; as Lord Luxborough

<P>I beg my compliments to my Lord <HI>of</HI> Dud|ley: and as to your Par&s;on, he cannot expo&s;e him&s;elf more in his pulpit than he did out of it, when he took advantage of your ab|sence to indulge his ill-natured di&s;po&s;ition by preventing you from executing the plea|&s;ing &s;cheme your good ta&s;te had &s;ugge&s;ted to you, and which would have heightened the beauties of your place. Had he one of his own that could vye with the &s;cenery of yours, it might have made envy an <HI>excu&s;e</HI> (if it is an allowable one) for what he did, which, with|out it, is &s;heer malice as ever any of <HI>hell's own</HI> inhabitants was capable of.</P>
<P>Mr. Williams carries my Hi&s;tory of Bar|badoes to Aris to bind, and with it the &s;heet of writing-paper for a &s;ample.</P>
<P>I was &s;orry to &s;ee Mr. Meredith's name u&s;ed in the &s;trange letter the Clergyman wrote to one Mr. Webb, about the 10th of

June; and for which the latter is taken up: but Mr. Meredith was not at the meeting.</P>
<P>Mr. Williams waits; &s;o I mu&s;t cea&s;e writing when I have de&s;ired a favour of you in behalf of Mr. William Holyoak, Apothe|cary, &s;econd &s;on to Par&s;on Holyoak, who with his wife, (whom I believe you have &s;een here) is at Birmingham in lodgings, with an intention of &s;etting up there.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS this letter is intended to &s;et out with a load of my wheat at Twelve o'clock, I hope the diligent Mrs. Scudamore will find it at the Po&s;thou&s;e when &s;he calls for letters To-morrow morning. It will carry you nei|ther agreeable news nor &s;prightly thoughts from me, as I am an invalid, though upon the recovery. I &s;hould at lea&s;t have imparted my complaints to you before, but that my &s;pi|rits flagged, and my hand faultered as much as you would have perceived my tongue to do, had you been here; and is not now very &s;teady, though much better &s;ince Monday evening; when I in&s;i&s;ted upon being let blood in &s;pite of the advice of the Galenical gen|tlemen, who feared it would deject my &s;pirits yet more: but as their advice was mechanical, I thought <HI>I</HI> could advi&s;e better; becau&s;e <HI>I felt</HI>, and <HI>they</HI> only <HI>&s;ugge&s;ted</HI>. I proved in the right: bleeding relieved me. The fir&s;t nine ounces were black as ink; the tenth was good blood; and no &s;ooner had I begun to bleed, but I felt ea&s;ier, and have been mending ever
<PB N="219" REF="225">
&s;ince; and have been able to go once my u&s;ual tour round my Coppice, &amp;c. Before that operation, my fever never intermitted; and I can &s;carcely &s;ay it remitted. The <HI>imme|diate</HI> cau&s;e of it is &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from the angui&s;h I felt by the mo&s;t uncommon &s;ting of a wa&s;p, which perhaps you ever heard of: it &s;tung a tendon on the out&s;ide of my arm near the elbow, on the 17th in&s;tant; on the 18th, it was &s;welled to my fingers ends, and by night had infected the blood &s;o, that the in&s;ide, at the bend of the arm (where lies a vein, an artery and a tendon) was inflamed &s;o greatly, that it obliged me to &s;end for my &s;ur|geon. He al&s;o found the arm no le&s;s hard (though much le&s;s beautiful) than that of Venus in her Shrine in my Walk; in&s;omuch that he feared it would impo&s;thumate, and has prevented it only by hot fomentations, &amp;c. &amp;c. and cooling phy&s;ic; and it was kept in a &s;ting above a week. The &s;ame day this mi&s;|fortune happened, I buried my tru&s;ty &s;ervant James, who had lived with me twenty-two years; and was incorruptible where my in|tere&s;t was concerned. He died the 15th. On the 16th, I received the news of poor Mr. Hall's having broke his arm, ju&s;t below the &s;houlder, by a fall from his hor&s;e, in riding
<PB N="220" REF="226">

One ought to have a &s;uper-natural a&s;&s;i&s;tance to keep one's &s;pirits up &s;o as to unravel all the&s;e accounts, and manage things properly at &s;uch a juncture; and I look upon my uncommon de&s;ire of being blooded, as the whi&s;per of &s;ome good Genii, &s;ince it has &s;ucceeded &s;o well.

<P><PB N="223" REF="229">I am a&s;&s;ured that the paper carvings are quite as beautiful, and more durable, than either wood or &s;tucco; and for ceilings in|finitely preferable, e&s;pecially as they may be moved, being only fa&s;tened up with tacks. They adorn chimnies and indeed whole rooms with them, and make picture-frames of them. The paper is boiled to ma&s;h and pounded a va&s;t while, then it is put into moulds of any form;&mdash; but farther I know not; only that when it is tacked up, you either paint it white, or gild it, as you would do wood. Several Ladies take the trouble of making this them&s;elves: but it is to be bought in &s;ingle ornaments, &s;o much a piece, or a dozen. So Lord Foley's Chapel-ceiling was bought.</P>

My bees join with me in inviting you to my little Library, where they rejoice in their labour, and work abundantly. It is a &s;ituation that Virgil has not marked out for them; but I dare &s;ay, were he to inhabit this earth again, he would not fail to call in an army of the&s;e u&s;eful creatures to form a colony in his Study, where he would view their works, and fancy him&s;elf one of their fellow-citizens. Would it be ami&s;s if every per|&s;on in power was obliged to have this piece of furniture, not for their amu&s;ement only, as I have it, but for their in&s;truction in the art of government? Be that as it will, it is really very entertaining to us Hermits.</P>

This &s;tep from my chamber to my parlour appears to me a &s;tep of con&s;equence; and I write to ac|quaint you of it, as I am vain enough to believe it will give you plea&s;ure; and al&s;o, as it is a duty incumbent upon me to return

Dr. Wall of Worce&s;ter was my phy&s;ician; and I think him a very inge|nious man: he and Mr. Holyoak were obliged to be &s;peedy, to prevent a mortification in the bowels; but after five or &s;ix days, I believe the danger of that was over. A &s;low fever has tormented me almo&s;t ever &s;ince: but as I am now determined to &s;hake off all com|plaints, I mu&s;t implore your a&s;&s;i&s;tance: for what can contribute &s;o much to the recovery of the body as the entertainment of the mind (particularly where the &s;pirits and nerves have been much affected)?

<P>THE favour of a vi&s;it from you, at any &s;ea&s;on, but more particularly in this rigid one, demands my earlie&s;t thanks; and the little di&s;order you complained of here makes me anxious to hear of your perfect recovery, and of your good journey home: therefore I begin my enquiries this day, though probably it may not be in my power to &s;end my letter
<PB N="232" REF="238">
before Thur&s;day, when &s;ome hone&s;t butcher or other may po&s;&s;ibly convey it to Birming|ham. But I was unwilling to defer even tho&s;e few days writing; for my late illne&s;s and your journey into Berk&s;hire have cau&s;ed &s;uch a cha&s;m in our corre&s;pondence, that I am im|patient to have it filled up. I could wi&s;h a daily courier was to go between the Lea|&s;owes and Barrells: yet it is happy for you that the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e; for my de&s;ire to receive letters from you would certainly make me &s;elfi&s;hly trouble&s;ome, by forcing mine upon you; which at be&s;t are not much worth reading, and can be no other than &s;tupid, when want of conver&s;ation and of agreeable objects deprive me of every thing amu&s;ing, and furni&s;h me with no ideas: no more ideas than the Pyramids of Egypt afforded to Dr. Perry; which he a&s;&s;ured Lord Che&s;terfield were <HI>none at all.&mdash;A propos</HI> to his Lord&s;hip; he is not the author of the Oeconomy of Human Life.</P>
<P>I was agreeably &s;urprized ye&s;terday with a vi&s;it from Dr. Wall, who dined with me, and returned to Worce&s;ter. He talked to me of a Poem that I am impatient to &s;ee: he had it in the manu&s;cript, and has it al&s;o in print; but it was publi&s;hed for the Public but on
<PB N="233" REF="239">
Saturday la&s;t: the author is Mr. Cambridge, the gentleman who entertained the Prince and Prince&s;s of Wales &s;o elegantly la&s;t &s;ummer at his Seat on the Severn; as you mu&s;t have read in the News-papers. The title of the Poem is, I think, <HI>the Scribleriad, an Heroic Poem</HI>. The &s;ubject is the &s;uppo&s;ed travels and adventures of Scriblerus; of which Dr. Wall named no particulars but one, which was his being enamoured with a Prince&s;s, whom he meets in a Gothic Ca&s;tle: and I imagine this Poem is not calculated to plea&s;e Mr. Miller, and the re&s;t of the Gothic gentlemen; for this Mr. Cambridge expre&s;&s;es a di&s;like to the in|troducing or reviving ta&s;tes and fa&s;hions that are inferior to the modern ta&s;te of our country. The fronti&s;piece to this Poem Dr. Wall pre|&s;ented Mr. Cambridge with: and as it is the Doctor's own drawing and inventing, I did not think it civil to a&s;k the de&s;cription of it; &s;o I wait, till I can get the book, to judge of it; and &s;hould be glad to have your judgment of it, when you have &s;een and read it. He &s;ays the Poem is all fini&s;hed: but I do not know whether this, which is publi&s;hed, is more than the fir&s;t part.&mdash;We talked of the Lea&s;owes: he wi&s;hed to &s;ee it, and &s;eemed to regret that
<PB N="234" REF="240">
his bu&s;ine&s;s deprived him of the plea&s;ure of going to &s;ee the places he &s;hould reli&s;h. If he has as great a reli&s;h for money as Dr. M&mdash;, the misfortune he complains of will be none to him: but I rather imagine him not to be of that exce&s;&s;ive craving temper.</P>
<P>As one is &s;till wi&s;hing for what one has not, I wi&s;h for fine weather, leaves on the trees, flowers in the Shrubbery, and all other the gay products of &s;pring, and with them your company and Mr. Whi&s;tler's under my Double Oak. Am I not exorbitant in my wi&s;hes? Half the&s;e plea&s;ures at a time might &s;uffice, one would think; but I am &s;o angry at being de|prived of them, that I cannot be appea&s;ed without enjoying them all. In the mean time I am freezing by the fire-&s;ide, which &s;corches without warming; and my ink is as frozen as my hands and my ideas. Your genius, Sir, does not freeze &s;o ea&s;ily; therefore I hope, in &s;pite of winter, you will employ it for the benefit of the Public, or at lea&s;t for that of your friends, and not let your pen, ink, and paper remain u&s;ele&s;s. It is a crime, you know, to bury a talent.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the fro&s;t is gone, (the good effects of which change I feel in my health) I hope your ink is thawed, which I am per&s;uaded has hitherto been froze; for I am &s;ure your genius cannot freeze, and I believe your friend&s;hip to be as warm as that: therefore can impute your cold &s;ilence to nothing but the &s;tagnation of your ink; but hope now &s;ome &s;treams of it will flow this way, in return for tho&s;e I &s;ent you from my ink-bottle a fort|night ago. I ought perhaps to have waited till I heard from you, before I troubled you a &s;econd time; but I was impatient to &s;end you the Draught I promi&s;ed to &s;end about to War|wick, for your &s;atisfaction as well as my own. I believe you will think (as I do) five guineas
<PB N="236" REF="242">
very dear: at lea&s;t I think it too much to give for a gla&s;s-frame for &s;uch an humble edifice as mine. The larger Daught Mr. Hands &s;ent me, and the &s;mall one Mr. Moore the &s;tucco-man &s;ent: whether they employed the &s;ame carver, I cannot tell. I find a &s;lighter &s;ort than either of the three will be three guineas. I imagine you could draw &s;omething genteeler than either, which might come to le&s;s. The propo&s;al for &s;tuccoing my little pa&s;&s;age makes it come al&s;o to more than I expected. Moore (who has lately been at London) talks to me of a &s;ort of &s;tucco-paper, which I had never heard of; and &s;ays Lord Foley has done his Chapel in Worce&s;ter&s;hire with it (the ceiling at lea&s;t). By his de&s;cription, the paper is &s;tamped &s;o deep as to project con&s;iderably, and is very thick and &s;trong; and the ornaments are all detached, and put on &s;eparately.&mdash;As &s;uppo&s;e, for example, it were the pattern of a common &s;tucco-paper, which is generally a mo&s;aic formed by a ro&s;e in a kind of octagon: it &s;eems, in this new way one of the&s;e ro&s;es is to be bought &s;ingly; &s;o you have as many in num|ber as the place requires, which are pa&s;ted up &s;eparately, and then gilt: the ornaments for the cornices are likewi&s;e in &s;eparate pieces, and, when fini&s;hed, cannot, I &s;uppo&s;e, be known
<PB N="237" REF="243">
from fretwork. The difficulty, and con&s;e|quently the expence, mu&s;t be in putting up the&s;e ornaments, which, as I under&s;tand, mu&s;t be done by a man whom the Paper-&s;eller &s;ends on purpo&s;e from London: but perhaps your ingenuity might avoid that, if you could &s;ee any fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et is going on (as &s;he writes me word) with the Chapel &s;he is making, which was a large Drawing-room. She gives 300<HI>l.</HI> for the three windows for it; which are &s;tained gla&s;s, done by one Pries, a mo&s;aic with|out figures, and of a Gothic form, and all the &s;tucco in the &s;ame ta&s;te, and ornamented. &mdash;Her Grace &s;ays there is an inundation of new books. She commends Mr. Fielding's En|quiry into the Cau&s;e of the Increa&s;e of Street-Robberies: and &s;he talks of a copy of Ver&s;es wrote in a Country Church-Yard; but &s;up|po&s;es I have &s;een that, though not printed.&mdash; I wrote you word before, that Dr. Wall had dined with me, and recommended the Scrib|leriad:&mdash;and here I mu&s;t end my &s;cribble, for want of room.</P>

Mais en v&eacute;rit&eacute;, Mon&s;ieur, votre lettre e&s;t en elle-m&ecirc;me trop bonne pour avoir be&s;oin de cet a&s;&s;ai&s;onnement; ain&s;i je vous &s;upplie de chercher &agrave; l'avenir des couriers un peu plus alertes: pour moi j'imagine que cette lettre tant attendue e&s;t venue &s;ur le dos de quelque lima&ccedil;on; car il n'y a qu'un me&s;&s;ager de cet e&s;pece qui ait p&ucirc; mettre treize jours &agrave; venir de chez vous ici. Ah que cela fait languir! et de plus, ces retardemens rompent le fil de la conver&s;ation qu'on t&acirc;che d'imiter par une corre&s;pondance r&eacute;guliere; et puis comme tout change dans ce monde (et encore plus &s;ouvent en Angleterre qu'ailleurs) ce que l'on, mande dans une lettre qui marche &s;i lentement, ne &s;e trouve plus le fait, lor&s;qu'on la re&ccedil;oit: Par exemple, Mon&s;ieur, vous me parlez de la gel&eacute;e, et je re&ccedil;ois cette nouvelle dans un orage de &abper;luie; ain&s;i du re&s;te: il n'y a que de notre amiti&eacute; dont j'o&s;e r&eacute;pondre de la &s;tabilit&eacute;: j'aurois d&ugrave; r&eacute;pondre &s;eulement de la mienne, mais je veux me flatter que vous ne me d&eacute;direz pas, Mon&s;ieur, quand j'y joins la v&ocirc;tre.</P>
<P>Vous avez voulu que je vous &eacute;crivi&s;&s;e en Fran&ccedil;ois, et je vous ob&eacute;is d'abord, au d&eacute;pens de la r&eacute;putation que j'ai de po&s;&s;&eacute;der cette l$ngue; car vous direz &s;&ucirc;rement, apr&egrave;s avoir
<PB N="240" REF="246">
l&ucirc; ce que j'&eacute;cris, qu'il n'y a rien de moins vrai que l'&eacute;loge qu'on me donne. Mais pour vous, Mon&s;ieur, c'e&s;t je crois de l'Arabe que vous m'&eacute;crivez; je ne comprend rien &agrave; ces Me&s;&s;ieurs et Dames les Glums, les Gawries, &amp;c. car non &s;eulement ce langage, et le livre o&ugrave; vous le prenez, me &s;ont inconnus, mais je n'a|vois jamais ou&iuml; dire qu'on en e&ucirc;t donn&eacute; un dans ce go&ucirc;t au Public; et j'eu&s;&s;e encore moins devin&eacute; qu'il auroit &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;di&eacute; &agrave; mon amie Madame de Northumberland. L'auteur ne me paro&icirc;t pas trop d&eacute;licat dans la compa|rai&s;on qu'il fait de cette Comte&s;&s;e &agrave; Made|moi&s;elle la Gawry (ail&eacute;e comme une chauve|&s;ouris): il faut e&s;p&eacute;rer que &s;on e&s;prit a plus d'agr&eacute;mens que &s;a figure.

<P>I &s;earched for the Green Book in your packet, and found only the Red Book, which I have not had time to open.

<P>I have been to-day all over my Gardens and Coppice, and find the former in very nice order, by the indefatigable care of my Scotch gardener; but the &s;ea&s;on has not favoured his labours: however, I believe you will find a great amend|ment in the appearance of it.

The merchant &s;hewed him one pod only, which is as big as a pine-apple, and perfumes a room even now it is not in flower. He has al&s;o got me a water-engine, made of Lignumvitae, which will water my garden with much ea&s;e.

You are very good in in&s;tructing me how to amend mine, and to im|prove the limited and &s;canty beauties of my &s;itu|ation. Your mi&s;take in calling the <HI>Service</HI>-Walk a <HI>Lime</HI>-Walk may prove a lucky hint: for why not make one of my Crooked Walks lead to my new Lime-Walk, which is planted with Horn|beam between, and &s;o wind as to go behind it into the Lane which is planted with abeles, and &s;o form a Serpentine through them to the Coppice, coming in &s;omewhere at the farther end of it, or behind the Great Oak? In the mean time, I will fill the Gravel-Walk with &s;hrubs, as you propo&s;e, and hide or take away the door that leads to the Coppice. Let me know if you comprehend my meaning. It will make the place private, and &s;urprize more at the entrance.&mdash;I find I can take away the foot-road to Henley. This propo&s;al would be

There will be thirty-eight feet of planting behind the Pavilion, within the hedge. The Ha! Ha! will bound the Green from the out&s;ide of the two rows of elms; the &s;loping part to be towards the Green, the perpendicular part towards the Pavilion, and walled. Four feet of turf will range with it before the Pavilion, which is to &s;tand upon two &s;tone &s;teps.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAD I been informed, even by a dream, that you and your Brother were &s;uffering &s;uch pain of body and mind, (which mu&s;t be the ca&s;e when one &s;uffers for one's friend, as well as for one's &s;elf) I would have &s;ent imme|diately to enquire after you both, and &s;hould have &s;uffered great anxiety till my me&s;&s;enger had returned: and even without the&s;e ills, (un|known to me till the 24th in&s;tant) I had &s;ent long before to return the Book, the Ode, &amp;c. and to enquire after you; but not having &s;o pre&s;&s;ing a rea&s;on as I &s;hould have had, could I have heard of your illne&s;s, I did delay it, and, I confe&s;s, delayed it too long: but it was next to impo&s;&s;ible to have done otherwi&s;e; the circum|&s;tantial
<PB N="258" REF="264">
rea&s;ons for which would make my letter a greater torment to you than my &s;ilence could po&s;&s;ibly be: &s;o I only &s;ay, that my avocations, and tho&s;e of my &s;ervants, have been attended with &s;o many rebuffs from weather and di&s;agree|able accidents, that I have been &s;till obliged to defer from minute to minute, day to day, and week to week, the bu&s;ine&s;s I would mo&s;t wil|lingly have done, and the <HI>devoirs</HI> that I ought to have paid my friends; but my heart has never been influenced by di&s;appointments, nor allured by any plea&s;ures, to &s;werve one moment from its fixed attachment to the per&s;ons it has de|voted it&s;elf and all its &s;tock of friend&s;hip to. Judge then, Sir, whether it can have been as ungrateful to you as it appears. Melancholy your &s;ituation mu&s;t have been, and is there|fore now I hope the more joyful by the recovery of your Brother; of which you gave me great rea&s;on for hopes.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day, May 1&s;t.</P>
<P>JUST at the break of my letter, I had a good deal of company come in; and two of them (Mrs. and Mi&s;s Chambers) came to &s;tay &s;ome time. Their coming obliged me to quit my pen; and indeed prevented my &s;ending Joe:

but I hope nothing will prevent his going to the Lea&s;owes to-morrow morning.</P>
<P>I beg my be&s;t compliments to Mr. Jo&s;eph Shen&s;tone, as does Mr. Hall to you both; and he hopes you are both able to enjoy the beauties of your Groves otherwi&s;e than through the window. He feels the more for you, as he has rea&s;on to fear his Brother is dying (if not dead by this time) at Bri&s;tol, where he left him exceeding ill. I am glad you have a neighbour re&s;embling good Mrs. Holyoak, to attend your &s;ick-chamber; as I have lately experienced the comfort &s;he was to mine.&mdash;I do not know Dr. Hervey nor Dr. Wilks; but &s;hall be as inclinable to love him who attended your call, and did his be&s;t &s;ervices, as I &s;hall be to di&s;like the other, unle&s;s I hear &s;ome very good rea&s;ons for his refu&s;ing to come at &s;uch an extremity.</P>
<P>My corre&s;pondence (had it not intermitted) would have afforded you no plea&s;ure: for as the effects of my mind have as &s;trong an influ|ence upon my nerves as yours have, and as I have had <HI>divers and &s;undry</HI> things to affect my mind; &s;o am I ill company to my&s;elf, to my vi&s;itants, and to my corre&s;pondents. Would you make me otherwi&s;e, pray ha&s;ten to give me a good account of your health, and of your

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have relieved me from anxious fears; for I imputed your &s;ilence to your having no good tidings to impart: but I have now the plea&s;ure to read of your Brother's better health, and con&s;equently of your own better &s;pirits; both which I rejoice at &s;incerely, and hope fine
<PB N="262" REF="268">
weather will complete what your great care of him has &s;o far effected, as your letter gives an account of; which is having done a great deal, con&s;idering the &s;everity of his illne&s;s, of which I hope he will have no relap&s;e.</P>
<P>My own &s;pirits are much lowered by my Brother Bolingbroke's misfortune; which thun|derbolt fell upon him quite unexpectedly, by the inju&s;tice or un&s;kilfulne&s;s of French juri&s;|prudence, and the chicane of their lawyers. He has appealed now to their parliament, where if he does not find redre&s;s, it will be to <HI>their</HI> di&s;|grace; but &s;o much to <HI>his</HI> detriment, that I dread the thoughts of it. The French judges are partial, even without having the mode&s;ty to di&s;|gui&s;e their partiality; and of the cu&s;tomary law of Paris it is &s;aid proverbially, <HI>Que les formes emportent le fond</HI>. This iniquitous and ab&s;urd judgment, given again&s;t my Brother, is upon a pre&s;umption that he was married to his late Lady before the year 1722, which he was <HI>not</HI>; though, out of honour and friend&s;hip, he did too much to let it be believed in France: and his delicacy is thus rewarded by her own Daughter and Son-in-law, who owe him great obligations. They take from him 18,500 livres a year in annuities in that country, and condemn him to pay 300,000 livres to the Marquis de Montmorin,

his Daughter-in-law's Hu&s;band. Every livre is a|bout one &s;hilling; &s;o the &s;um is very con&s;iderable to any body, much more to a per&s;on harra&s;&s;ed by attainders, forfeitures, &amp;c.&mdash;But why do I har|ra&s;s you with all this account? it is &s;eemingly not the part of a friend to do &s;o, as your &s;pirits rather want to be cheared: and yet it is a &s;trong proof of friend&s;hip; for to whom &s;hould one open one's heart and &s;peak of one's &s;orrows, but to the per&s;on whom one thinks capable of feeling for one? and of cour&s;e that mu&s;t be one we have a friend&s;hip for, and on who&s;e reciprocal friend&s;hip we depend.</P>
<P>But now to talk of your favourite &s;ea&s;on <HI>Spring:</HI> Are you not a little a&s;hamed at the appearance &s;he has made this year? Such an advocate as you &s;he mu&s;t &s;urely have forfeited; and where will &s;he find &s;uch another? <HI>I</HI> tri|umph at pre&s;ent, and hope Autumn will be &s;o fine as to increa&s;e my partiality to what your charming lines had almo&s;t made me de&s;ert. Before that &s;ea&s;on arrives, I hope to &s;ee the Lea-&s;owes: for I have u&s;ually gone to it later in the year than was convenient. I am &s;orry you cannot &s;ee my Shrubbery now; for it is in its prime. I am new-laying with &s;and all my Walks in that and the Coppice. My Kitchen-Garden is much improved by your having
<PB N="264" REF="271">
directed it to be lengthened: the Melon Ground is al&s;o made warmer and more private. I am going to fence-in the Service-Tree Walk from the Sheep; for my new gardener has at la&s;t contrived to keep other intruders out of it by a Ha! Ha! and high bank he has made acro&s;s the Lane. My Hermitage has been perfectly dry all this wet &s;ea&s;on, by the alteration I made when I thatched it; and more than this I can|not &s;ay, though I &s;eem at pre&s;ent in a humour to extol my <HI>environs:</HI> perhaps it is becau&s;e I have been deprived of the enjoyment of them by the bad weather, and therefore prize them the more, as &s;ome &s;ort of tempers are fonde&s;t of their friends when ab&s;ent from them, and grow tired of them when they have their com|pany. However my re&s;emblance to tho&s;e per&s;ons may be as far as relates to my gardens, I do not &s;ay; but I will affirm I have no re&s;em|blance to them as to what relates to my friends; for, ab&s;ent or pre&s;ent, they are always dear to me: but their pre&s;ence is what I mo&s;t wi&s;h for. I mu&s;t, however, u&s;e my&s;elf (or rather am u&s;ed) to love people at a di&s;tance; for I &s;ee nobody near to be&s;tow my affections upon. Tho&s;e few who de&s;erve them are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;natched from me by one awkward event or other; and I &s;eldom find u&s;e for that member the tongue,
<PB N="265" REF="272" MS="Y">
which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o e&s;&s;ential to women. My ears are <HI>as</HI> u&s;ele&s;s to me; for the whi&s;tling of the winds is their only entertainment: but my eyes have at pre&s;ent an agreeable verdure to admire, and forty-three troop-hor&s;es to ob&s;erve &s;campering in my meadow, which, with the tent of the gra&s;s-guards, really makes the &s;cenery pretty from my windows: and, &s;olitary as I am, I neither envy the frequenters of Vauxhall nor Ranelagh; and can read of a Jubilee in the News-paper without once wi&s;hing to &s;ee it. My Brother &s;ays that I am almo&s;t buried civilly before I am &s;o naturally; and &s;eems to think of following my example; but <HI>that</HI> I am &s;orry for. <HI>My</HI> being cut off from &s;ociety is of no con&s;equence to it; but <HI>his</HI> being &s;o is.</P>
<P>I would &s;end you Pompey the Little, if I had it; but the Gentleman who lent it me, bor|rowed it of another Gentleman, to whom it was to be returned on a day named. It is entertain|ing enough for &s;uch a trifle. Fielding, you know, cannot write without humour. Pere|grine Pickle I do not admire: it is by the author of Roderick Random, who is a lawyer: but the thing which makes the book &s;ell, is the Hi&s;tory of Lady V&mdash;, which is introduced (in the la&s;t volume, I think) much to her Lady|&s;hip's
<PB N="266" REF="273">
di&s;honour; but publi&s;hed by her <HI>own</HI> order, from her <HI>own</HI> Memoirs, given to the author for that purpo&s;e; and by the approba|tion of her <HI>own</HI> Lord. What was ever equal to this fact? and how can one account for it?&mdash; I never read the letters from the characters in David Simple till the other day, though Mrs. Fielding publi&s;hed them four years ago; and her Brother commends them much. I think the Vi&s;ion, at the end of them, is the be&s;t thing in the two volumes.&mdash;I cannot tell who wrote the Ver&s;es in a Country Church-Yard, but I like them well; and think all the fir&s;t part of the Elegy very beautiful. I cannot &s;ee why it did not end at the mo&s;t beautiful line in it.&mdash;I &s;end you Mr. We&s;t upon Education; as being the only new thing Dod&s;ley has &s;ent me. I would eagerly embrace any opportunity of contributing to your entertainment, and am grieved it is &s;o little in my power: my few corre&s;pondents at London are too much taken up with their own amu&s;ements to think of re|galing their country friends: nay, I believe few of them think at all, being giddy with the whirlwind of diver&s;ions of which they are in a continual rotation, and impart none of their plea&s;ures, not even the relation of them, to us <HI>Campagnards</HI>; &s;o that we have nothing to im|part
<PB N="267" REF="274">
that is new to each other. The &s;tagnation of the commodity <HI>Scandal</HI>, I am <HI>not</HI> &s;orry for; but <HI>that</HI> of the currency of wit, humour, or indeed the mere occurrences of the day, we &s;uffer by: for when <HI>they</HI> circulate, <HI>we</HI> give le&s;s way to melancholy thoughts, which are too apt to prey upon the minds of us reclu&s;e people, and do us as much hurt in one &s;en&s;e, as the people of the world's having no thought at all does them in another.&mdash;But I ju&s;t now perceive that I let my own thoughts ramble without bounds, and that my pen obeys them to your misfortune. I con&s;ole my&s;elf a little in remembering to have heard you &s;ay you loved to receive <HI>long</HI> letters from your friends. Happy &s;hould I be, were you (<HI>who to my co&s;t are not</HI>) like an Iri&s;hman, who being &s;ent with three pence for a letter directed to his Ma&s;ter, &s;lyly changed it for one he &s;aw at the Po&s;t-hou&s;e, charged &s;ixpence, being double; and though it was directed to another Gentleman, brought it home to his Ma&s;ter, re|joicing at his contrivance, as this letter was twice as big as that he expected: Were this, I &s;ay, your ca&s;e, the letter I am writing would have &s;ome merit with you; whereas, intrin&s;ically it has ju&s;t none at all, except its coming from a &s;incere Friend, though &s;tupid Corre&s;pon|dent.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="275">But to continue this rhap&s;ody (which I ad|vi&s;e you to throw into the fire before you read it); I, who never was given to &s;peak much in prai&s;e of Kings, cannot but commend the hu|mane conduct of our own, upon occa&s;ion of his Son's death, and the tenderne&s;s he has &s;hewn to the Prince&s;s Dowager and her children. But I need not have excu&s;ed my commending Kings, &s;ince the actions I commend in him are not owing to his Royalty; but when humanity is joined with it, tho&s;e actions are more con&s;picu|ous, and, I fear I might add, more rare.&mdash;I am a&s;&s;ured (<HI>&agrave; propos</HI> to Kings) that the Memoirs of the Hou&s;e of Brandenburgh are wrote by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia him&s;elf; which makes me wi&s;h to read them.</P>
<P>Now (<HI>&agrave; propos</HI> to nothing yet &s;aid) I mu&s;t tell you that it is true Mr. Hall felt &s;trongly for his Brother's illne&s;s and death, and was a&s;&s;i&s;tant to him to the utmo&s;t of his power: he has &s;ince been fatigued with the con&s;equences of it, which will, I imagine, continue &s;ome time, as he voluntarily takes the trouble of &s;ettling accounts, &amp;c. with no le&s;s than three or four per&s;ons his Brother was concerned for, viz. the Bi&s;hop of London, Mr. Savage, Mr. Kend$l, and perhaps more; but I do not know. $$e was a great lo&s;s to his family; and &s;ine his

He is making up another with the Bi&s;hop of London; and there is Mr. Kendal be&s;ides; and I believe more people: and though his Brother's Hone&s;ty and Punctuality does not leave it a difficult ta&s;k to do, yet it takes a great deal of time from a per&s;on who has other employments: but he will go to the Lea&s;owes as &s;oon as he has more lei&s;ure.

I will however hope that I con&s;trued it in a wor&s;e &s;en&s;e than there was occa&s;ion for; and I &s;hould have &s;ent again ere now to be more fully informed, had I had it in my power; but bu&s;i|ne&s;s, company, and weather, all impeded: and even now, Joe carries this to Mr. Williams;

This ap|pears inhuman; but &s;o it mu&s;t be: for with four of my hor&s;es he conveys my landau to the &s;aid Mr. Williams to paint anew, and to get mended; and mu&s;t return at night with the &s;ame four hor&s;es to Barrells, where he will find full forty hor&s;es more; being tho&s;e of Captain Robin&s;on's Troop, which are to graze here till winter, if gra&s;s ever appears. Thus harra&s;&s;ed with that incumbrance (which might have been very profitable) and confined to my chimney-corner, without a flower to adorn my chimney-piece, or a goo&s;eberry my board, I langui&s;h out this everla&s;ting winter without &s;o much as progno&s;ticating its end. I did indeed ye&s;terday dine with Mrs. Kendal at Stratford, whom I had not &s;een &s;ince the lo&s;s of her only Son, and her favourite Si&s;ter: but found the roads, the weather, and every thing &s;o bad, (except her company) that I never was &s;o fatigued in go|ing forty or fifty miles in a day.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY not having an&s;wered yours, of the 14th ultimo, is owing to the hopes you gave me of &s;urprizing me agreeably with a vi&s;it. The &s;ea&s;on is now favourable for it; and I pro|mi&s;e you to return it &s;oon. Why &s;hould you not come and celebrate St. Swithin's Day with me? Your company will make me regard the day which gave me birth with much more plea&s;ure than the circum&s;tance of its having fir&s;t &s;hewn me the light: for what is light, or any other ble&s;&s;ing, without &s;ocial friends?</P>
<P>I return Mr. Somervile's Picture (as I &s;up|po&s;e you meant I &s;hould). I think it very like Worledge's, and indeed like Mr. Somervile; but methinks it &s;carcely does him ju&s;tice, as &s;ome of the lea&s;t agreeable features in his face
<PB N="277" REF="284">
are rather too &s;trongly marked; as under the eyes for example; and I think as he was very fair, the pencil might be fainter. But upon the whole, had I not another of him, I would not give this for a great &s;um. His urn is now beautifully &s;haded by its canopy of oak; under which I &s;at la&s;t night agreeably, though alone, looking at the neighbouring hills, hearing my mowers whet their &s;cythes, &s;eeing the troop-hor&s;es &s;camper about my avenue, and hearing one of the Gra&s;s-Guard Dragoons play on his German Flute; which he does very well: he has al&s;o a pair of Iri&s;h Bag-pipes, with which he can play in concert; they having &s;ixteen notes, and the Scotch but nine. He has no pipe to put to his mouth, and but very little motion with his arm; his fingers do the chief. You &s;hall hear him on Monday, if you plea&s;e; and I hope you will plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay your new windows will plea&s;e others, though they may not plea&s;e you. You have not indulgence enough for your own ta&s;te; nay, you do it inju&s;tice. Do not talk of <HI>altering old hou&s;es</HI>, or of <HI>maturing and perfecting errors</HI>; that touches me home, and makes me wince: for too true it is, that after a va&s;t deal of money laid out, one has nothing per|fect,
<PB N="278" REF="285">
nor within many degrees of perfection.</P>
<P>Your town of Birmingham grows very po|lite. I think the Players, who enjoyed the plea&s;ure of your Grove, &s;hould have entertained you there. How delightful would be the Ma&s;que of Comus acted on that &s;pot!</P>
<P>I think Mr. Dolman's objection to coming here the day you propo&s;ed it can hardly be received as an excu&s;e. Deficiency in point of dre&s;s is never ob&s;erved, where there is no defi|ciency in &s;entiment and &s;en&s;e; therefore he might have come &s;afely any-where, and &s;till more &s;o to me, who lay very little &s;tre&s;s upon the outward ornaments of my acquaintance.</P>
<P>I am extremely glad Mr. Jo&s;eph Shen&s;tone continues pretty well; and beg my compli|ments to him.&mdash;Lord St. John is &s;till at Batter|&s;ea, but is going to Caen, in Normandy, to the Academy.&mdash;My &s;ervant Price is at London upon bu&s;ine&s;s. I expect him home on Saturday; when I hope to hear more of my friends in tho&s;e parts.

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT twelve o'clock at noon, and in bed, (to my &s;hame be it &s;poken) I received your packet: the only thing fortune has favoured me in this la&s;t fortnight. I hope her next gift will be your company here or at the Lea&s;owes, if I have &s;pirits enough left to go that far. You never knew mine at &s;o low an ebb as they are at pre&s;ent; and con&s;equently I never had &s;o much occa&s;ion for your company and your letters; which I find a reli&s;h in, though in few other things in life. You &s;hould have be&s;towed upon me the &s;ight of the Ver&s;es that went to Hagley. I envy the company there the plea&s;ure they have in peru&s;ing them; which their good ta&s;te and good judgments make them
<PB N="284" REF="291">
worthy of: but if the &s;entiments of hearts alone were to be con&s;ulted, I feel my&s;elf as worthy as they can be of &s;eeing your Works, by the &s;incere regard and friend&s;hip I have for the author.</P>
<P>I find the Lea&s;owes is become the re&s;ort of the <HI>beau monde</HI>; nor do I wonder at it; but I think the Ma&s;ters of the Vauxhalle, Ranelaghs, and the Playhou&s;es in the neighbourhood ought to file a bill again&s;t you, for decoying their company from them.&mdash;If Sir Harry Gough has no better ta&s;te for the environs of a place than he &s;hews in his choice of liquor, he does not de&s;erve to &s;ee your Grove: for whey is, I think, what one would not go &s;o far to drink.</P>
<P>A Mr. Gough of Perry-Hall was here, about three weeks ago, to a&s;k leave to &s;ee my Her|mitage, and &s;aid he liked it. I do not enjoy it much my&s;elf: the cold weather and ince&s;&s;ant rain would hinder me, were I even in better &s;pirits. Indeed, you will &s;ay, it is ju&s;t a pro|per place for indulging melancholy thoughts; which is true; but therefore I ought to &s;hun it.&mdash;I am to dine to-morrow at Umbe$&s;lade, as little as I like going out.&mdash;I dare an&s;wer that Lord and Lady Archer would have been glad to meet you here.

when they return from Warwick Races, I mu&s;t make them two vi&s;its; and I ought to go to Mr. We&s;t's, whom you mention, if I did any thing that ceremony requires; and after the&s;e vi&s;its, I propo&s;e to pack up my night-cap, and make a more agreeable vi&s;it at the Lea&s;owes; which plea&s;ure, I hope, the ingratitude and malice that per&s;ecutes me, cannot deprive me of. In the mean time, I flatter my&s;elf that your workmen will &s;pare you to have a peep at the Bees in my Library, and at my venerable Oak: The &s;oldier that played on the German Flute &s;o well, whil&s;t I &s;at under it, is returned to Worce&s;ter, which I am &s;orry for; it &s;ounded &s;o well among&s;t the trees as I walked in my little wood; and even his bagpipes were not di&s;agreeable. He played on both on my birth|day, whil&s;t we bowled, and had our &s;yllabub out of doors; for I had no entertainment to offer but <HI>des amu&s;emens champ&eacute;tres</HI>.</P>
<P>My Brother Bolingbroke is every day in ex|pectation to hear &s;ome account from France of his trouble&s;ome law-&s;uit: after that, he will determine what to do.

<P>THE depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits my letter di&s;co|vered to you, turned into a dangerous bi|lious fever; and the bile which has by proper medicines been di&s;charged, proved to be as black as in my late illne&s;s (when you &s;ent to enquire &s;o kindly after me, and when it was &s;uppo&s;ed I could not live).

having an&s;wered your la&s;t obliging letter, nor having returned your delightful Ode; which has run in my head, and been the only plea&s;ing thought during my confinement to my bed; but the plea&s;ure was generally eclip&s;ed by pain before I could have &s;poke (much le&s;s have wrote) my approbation of it; and now I do it with a weak hand and head, the fever never having left me for a week; but my heart thanks you for <HI>my &s;hare</HI> of the compliments you pay to your vi&s;itors at the Lea&s;owes, and which every party de&s;erves more than my&s;elf, by their merit; but can never de&s;erve it more by their &s;entiments in regard to you.

<P>I cannot write much more; yet mu&s;t tell you one &s;ecret which nobody in this neighbour|hood knows, viz. that my Brother Bolingbroke is to &s;end a &s;et of hor&s;es from Batter&s;ea on Saturday next, to fetch me to him.

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMONG the many di&s;agreeable things I &s;uffer from the <HI>iniquity of Chance</HI>, (as you expre&s;s it) it is none of the lea&s;t, that I am de|prived
<PB N="289" REF="296">
of &s;eeing you and your improvements at the Lea&s;owes. I &s;ometimes form an idea of them; but they amu&s;e me in that &s;hape only as a fairy-tale. You do me ju&s;tice, when you believe that I would willingly (I may add joy|fully) have gone and &s;pent &s;ome days with you: but, as the vulgar French proverb &s;ays, <HI>l'homme propo&s;e, et Dieu di&s;po&s;e</HI>.</P>
<P>You are extremely kind in &s;ending to enquire after my health; as al&s;o in advi&s;ing me to be le&s;s precipitate, than I generally am, in my journies. My Brother Bolingbroke de&s;ires the &s;ame of me; and adds, that he is hopeful I &s;hall find his cancer near, if not quite, extir|pated; which revives me a little. If it be &s;o, it will do honour to the per&s;on who undertook the cure, and whom Mr. Chi&s;elden, in a letter to me, treated with &s;ome &s;corn, as a <HI>Cancer|curer, Operator</HI>, &amp;c. But before my Brother employed him, he had &s;ufficient a&s;&s;urances that the remedy had &s;ucceeded in a multitude of ca&s;es; which he took care to have examined and verified: therefore he &s;ays, he &s;hould <HI>even</HI> be more unfortunate than it belongs to <HI>him</HI> to be, if it failed in his ca&s;e alone. Perhaps I may bring him back with me; and who knows but we three may meet here? as to the Lea|&s;owes, I cannot an&s;wer; for I believe he will
<PB N="290" REF="297">
not make many peregrinations the re&s;t of his life.</P>
<P>I will undoubtedly write to you from Batter|&s;ea; and have &s;ent this day covers to Lord Archer to frank, with that intent. You mu&s;t not expect much news, or any thing jovial from thence; but &s;incerity of heart you may always expect from me; nor need you doubt my remembering you wherever I am. The affection of my real friends, and the civilities they &s;hew me, make a much &s;tronger impre&s;|&s;ion upon me than the injuries of my enemies, or even than the treachery and ingratitude of &s;uppo&s;ed friends.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the Prince's Pillar at Hag|ley, as I remember, did not much plea&s;e me: the effect it will have in the other place I can|not judge of at this di&s;tance. If Sir Thomas dies, I &s;uppo&s;e his Son and Mr. Pitt will ex|tend their genius and ta&s;te &s;ome miles: but they cannot obtain for money what Nature has pre&s;ented you with at the Lea&s;owes; I mean, a command of water.</P>
<P>That I approve your Ode is no merit in me, unle&s;s you account it one to know that a good thing is good.</P>
<P>As to Peregrine Pickle, I hired it, and that merely for the &s;ake of reading one of the
<PB N="291" REF="298" MS="Y">
volumes, wherein are in&s;erted th$ Memoirs of Lady V&mdash;; which, as I was well $$quainted with her, gave me curio&s;ity. The $word$ the book is, I think, ill wrote, and not inter$$ting. Pompey the Little is pretty and humored$, and the language good; but it was only lent me; and I have had nothing of late from Dod&s;ley: but you may depend upon it, if I pick up any thing worth reading at London, I will &s;end it you. I am glad your Brother has had no return lately of his a&s;thma, and beg my compliments to him, as al&s;o to Mr. and Mi&s;s Dolman.</P>
<P>I have laid your letter to Mr. Outing upon my chimney-piece, where he will find it if he comes to Barrells: when that will be, it is not in my power to &s;ay, any more than it is in his, I &s;uppo&s;e, to be more ambulant.</P>
<P>I cannot give your me&s;&s;age to Mr. Hall, not having &s;een him this month. He is, I believe, at Harborough, and would undoubtedly accept of your invitation.</P>
<P>I beg you will favour me with your com|mands to London, which I can execute with ea&s;e, and will do it with punctuality.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now a&s;k pardon for keeping your &s;ervant-maid all night again&s;t her inclination and duty: for &s;he &s;aid &s;he had promi&s;ed to come
<PB N="292" REF="299">

I &s;ent her word, I was apprized of the length of way, and that the fatigue would be too much, and moreover that I would take the fault upon me, if it was one; &s;o, dear Sir, you are to puni&s;h me and not her, if this proves ami&s;s. I have &s;ent her to &s;ee my Gardens and Coppice; but fear &s;he will de&s;pi&s;e them, being u&s;ed to your's.</P>

<P>AS I was &s;tepping into my po&s;t-chai&s;e this morning, your &s;ervant delivered me your obliging letter; which nothing &s;hould have prevented my an&s;wering immediately, but going to church; from whence I am this mo|ment returned, &s;o pinched with cold, and my

To which I may add another rea&s;on, Sir Peter Soame being ju&s;t come in to dinner: but I mu&s;t find time, in ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, to tell you that I am greatly plea&s;ed with the hopes of &s;eeing you at Barrells next week; and I e&s;teem my&s;elf <HI>no &s;mall Heroine</HI>, &s;ince I have removed &s;uch a bar to my plea|&s;ure as was your <HI>indolence</HI>, which prevented my &s;eeing you here; but &s;ince that is removed, I glory in my exploit, and am, Sir,</P>

<P>HAD I had a &s;ervant to &s;end to the Lea|&s;owes, I &s;hould not have omitted thank|ing you for your kind (though &s;hort) vi&s;it, long before this time: but Price and Joe were both at London; the re&s;t of my dome&s;ticks all new &s;ervants, that are as unknown to me as the road to your hou&s;e is to them. Price came home in my po&s;t-chai&s;e la&s;t Saturday, but re|turns to London on Friday next. He brought me a letter from Mrs. Wymonde&s;old, in which was the inclo&s;ed Po&s;t&s;cript, as al&s;o a very di|minutive bottle of Sweets, which I &s;end with this letter to the care of Mr. Williams. She goes to Tunbridge the fir&s;t week in July, and to Bath the fir&s;t week in October; between which &s;ea&s;ons &s;he will endeavour to prevail with her Father-in-law to di&s;pen&s;e with her company three weeks, in order to &s;pend them here with me.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now beg the favour of you to in&s;truct me about the ceiling of my bed-room, which I would have adorned a little with <HI>papier mach&eacute;</HI>
<PB N="300" REF="307">
and the ground painted of a colour; but do not know where to get the paper ornaments, nor how to have them fixed up: for no per&s;on hereabouts has the &s;malle&s;t idea of it. Should not the ceiling and cove, which are at pre&s;ent plain &s;tucco much cracked, be mended by the Warwick plai&s;terer, before the re&s;t is attempted?

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR quick return to my trouble&s;ome letter gave me much plea&s;ure, but no &s;urprize, as you have long accu&s;tomed me to all friendly attentions on your part: but your taking down your whole <HI>ceiling</HI> to &s;end me, merely to &s;atisfy my impertinent curio&s;ity, is a gallantry that quite confounds me; and your maid's charging her&s;elf with it, and bringing it &s;afe, though unaccompanied, and riding &s;ingle, &s;hews her a Heroine. Had you &s;een me open the parcel, you would have found me a contra&s;t to her. Fear and trembling &s;eized me ere I read that it was extremely tender and apt to break. It increa&s;ed &s;o much upon viewing the truth of that, that as I re|ceived the pieces I returned them in five mi|nutes time to your &s;ervant, le&s;t any thing &s;hould happen to them here: but however, in that &s;hort time, I perceived that your advice to me was proper in regard to <HI>my</HI> ceiling, and that your ornaments mu&s;t look very pretty in <HI>yours</HI>. I will write to Bromwich to &s;end me
<PB N="302" REF="309">
&s;ome in that ta&s;te, and will get the accidental cracks I mentioned to you repaired; after which, if the Gentleman your neighbour favours me with a vi&s;it and with his directions, it will infinitely oblige me.</P>
<P>You plea&s;e me in telling me you have had company, and more &s;o, in telling me you are not at pre&s;ent the lea&s;t aver&s;e to &s;uch di&s;&s;ipa|tion; for your aver&s;ene&s;s to it prevented the effect which you &s;eemed to want from &s;uch a remedy. I am my&s;elf too aver&s;e to that remedy to wonder you are &s;o: but it is common to preach better than one practi&s;es.</P>
<P>I know Mrs. Stanley; for I &s;uppo&s;e you mean the Daughter of Sir Hans Sloane, Si&s;ter of Lady Cadogan: Admiral Smith I do not know: but who is there but mu&s;t wi&s;h to know him, when <HI>you</HI> &s;ay he is the <HI>delight of mankind?</HI>&mdash;I am glad Lord Dudley is re&s;tored to you, and beg my compliments to him and Mi&s;s Lea.&mdash;Mr. Outing is &s;till at Henley at Mr. Holyoak's: he comes here &s;ometimes as a day-vi&s;iter; &s;ometimes &s;tays a night, which he did ye&s;terday with Jack Reynalds; and they left me this morning. He knows he is welcome for longer.&mdash;I am glad Sir George Lyttelton has a view to modern plans for his hou&s;e;
<PB N="303" REF="310">
which certainly ought to be more modern (or more antique) than it is.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wymonde&s;old in my opinion de&s;erves no thanks for &s;uch an ideal pre&s;ent: for my part, I &s;aw nothing in the little bottle (which I dur&s;t not open) but a green &s;mall &s;hadow: if any thing was ever in it (as undoubtedly there was) it mu&s;t have evaporated, as well it might, being covered with <HI>nothing</HI>, and &s;topt with a common gla&s;s-&s;topper.&mdash;You do Price too much honour:&mdash;he is at London; how <HI>well</HI> or <HI>ill</HI>, I do not know at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Talking of illne&s;s, mention with real con|cern that of your maid's &s;i&s;ter; and the more &s;o, as &s;he is a &s;ervant you recommended to me, and whom I much wi&s;hed to have found capable of the work her po&s;t here obliged her to; which is in it&s;elf &s;uch as only a &s;trong and healthy per&s;on u&s;ed to work can go through; I mean when I have my whole dairy; but &s;ince &s;he has been here, I have had but one cow, and no labour; yet the poor girl was &s;eized with pains in all her limbs about four days ago, which grew wor&s;e, and are more fixed in one arm now. I no &s;ooner knew it, but I &s;ent for Mr. Holyoak, who is the per&s;on with whom I intru&s;t my own health: after he had talked with her, he told me &s;he &s;aid any cold was
<PB N="304" REF="311">
apt to give her &s;uch pains (which he called rheumatic); and that wetting her feet would do it immediately. This is a great misfor|tune to a &s;ervant, and makes it impo&s;&s;ible to a mi&s;tre&s;s to keep one &s;o tender; and would be great imprudence in the &s;ervant, however willing, (as I dare &s;ay this is) to attempt it. Therefore hope dear Mr. Shen&s;tone will not take it ami&s;s that I part with her. I offer her and your own maid-&s;ervant my po&s;t-chai&s;e to carry them together, as it would be more ea&s;y for Hannah on Monday; and hope your own maid will accept the offer, that &s;he may ac|company her &s;i&s;ter, and al&s;o &s;ee Barrells to|morrow (Sunday) with le&s;s interruption.</P>

<P>ANY me&s;&s;enger that comes from the Lea&s;owes is &s;ure to be welcome at Bar|rells (as Hannah would have been, if you had permitted her to come).&mdash;You are very kind in being &s;olicitous about my health, which is good now, my Birmingham cough has left me; but it continued a con&s;iderable time after you went from hence.</P>
<P>I congratulate you upon having had &s;o much agreeable company, who will undoubt|edly vi&s;it you often; as, by your account of them, they &s;eem to be people of ta&s;te.&mdash;My pride cannot be heightened by Sir George Lyttelton's approbation of my Lines, becau&s;e Mr. Shen&s;tone had commended them before, and has thought them worthy of being re|touched by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lord Dudley is &s;low in fixing a day for giving me the plea&s;ure of his and your com|pany: but I hope the re&s;olution will come
<PB N="313" REF="320">
upon him &s;uddenly, and will as &s;uddenly be executed; though I cannot promi&s;e his Lord|&s;hip any plea&s;ure in the journey, except that of <HI>obliging</HI>; which I know is a great one to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Outing and I have lived like two Hermits &s;ince you left us. The few fine days we have had I have employed in making &s;mall improve|ments (alterations at lea&s;t) in my Coppice, and in the way to it: but much more planting is required; and I want greatly a hedge that will grow as quick as yours did, and I &s;hall prize it as much (but with far more rea&s;on) as the <HI>venerable</HI> Dean does his newly-found Druid-Idol.</P>
<P>I return your &s;mall Red Book, after having copied the Ode on Indolence, which plea&s;es me much.&mdash;I al&s;o &s;end you by tru&s;ty Tom three Ro&s;es for your Gothic windows, which you may fix up without cen&s;ure, for they are all <HI>red</HI>.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve your aver&s;ion to Autumn con|tinues, and that, when you find your &s;pirits depre&s;&s;ed, you are ready to lay the fault on the &s;ea&s;on; but I take it that &s;olitude is the chief cau&s;e, and the nur&s;e of <HI>painful ideas</HI>.</P>
<P>I hope Mrs. Arnold is well, and &s;hall be obliged to her for a Guinea cock, when con|venient.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="321">Pray remember me kindly to Mr. Pixall, and a&s;k if he be&s;poke my long &s;tools and fire-grate at Birmingham? and whether he &s;poke to Mr. Williams?</P>
<P>Adieu. I am interrupted by Mr. John Rey|nalds, and Mr. Bradley, and Lady Plymouth's &s;ervant, from writing more; but never can be interrupted in my &s;entiments of friend&s;hip and gratitude towards you, which are immutable.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LONG have I expected the plea&s;ure of your company and Lord Dudley's, but have expected in vain; and my impatience at the delay will &s;ufficiently &s;how the greater im|patience and the concern I now feel at finding my&s;elf obliged to prolong that delay, which I wi&s;hed to &s;horten.&mdash;The truth is, that my

old &s;ervant Price is &s;truck with a pal&s;y, and one half of his body is dead; &s;o that he is entirely helple&s;s: and as his weight and &s;ize do not agree with the narrowne&s;s of my garret-&s;tairs, there was not a po&s;&s;ibility of carrying him, la&s;t Saturday, higher than the fir&s;t &s;tory; where he has continued ever &s;ince in the bed Mr. Outing lay in till then; and another per|&s;on lays in the other bed, in the &s;ame room, to be ready at hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and turn him as he lays. This accident, and the con&s;equences of it, perplex me a good deal; but it was unavoidable: for &s;o faithful an old &s;ervant could not be &s;ent out of the hou&s;e, unle&s;s in|humanity had guided me; which I hope will never be the ca&s;e, though I forfeit my own plea&s;ure; for I cannot a&s;k to &s;ee you and Lord Dudley, where I could not lodge you. I have literally but one &s;pare bed at pre&s;ent, and that is u&s;ed by Dr. Wall when he comes to the &s;ick man.&mdash;I never till now wi&s;hed for a &s;pa|cious habitation: my &s;mall one was &s;ufficient for my u&s;e, and fully &s;atisfied my ambition; but now that it bani&s;hes my friends, it is in|&s;upportable to me: it is, however, but for a time, and <HI>that</HI>, I hope, a <HI>&s;hort one</HI>.

In the mean time, be plea&s;ed to pre&s;ent my compliments to Lord Dudley and Mi&s;s Lea, and acquaint his Lord|&s;hip of my di&s;appointment.&mdash;Mr. Outing pre|&s;ents his compliments to you, and a&s;ks your commands to London, where he is obliged to go &s;oon.&mdash;I am mo&s;t &s;incerely, dear Sir,</P>

<P>IT is both kind and polite of you to &s;end &s;o far to enquire after my hone&s;t old &s;ervant Price: but the an&s;wer is &s;uch as I believe you gue&s;s:&mdash;He is no more. It plea&s;ed God to relea&s;e him from his mi&s;ery, but not till ye&s;ter|day morning, at two or three o'clock. He had his &s;en&s;es to the la&s;t, and made his will.

My hurry, and the confu&s;ion of my hou&s;e, has been very great, and is not yet at an end: The having almo&s;t all new &s;ervants makes it lay harder upon me. &mdash;Mr. Outing was to have gone for London to-day; but does not go till next Monday, and de&s;ires his be&s;t compliments to you.</P>
<P>If you &s;ee Mr. Pixall, pray &s;ay that I do not mean to give two guineas for a fender; and I even think I need not have any bought: but would be glad of a &s;mall grate; and I am obliged to him for the trouble of getting the things made which I be&s;poke.&mdash;My great Parlour looks very hand&s;ome now it is painted with flake-white.</P>
<P>Thanks for your Stanza to Admiral Smith, which is genteel and elegant. You are happy in having neighbours de&s;erving of your pane|gyrics.&mdash;Mrs. Dillon's beauty claims a con|&s;iderable place among them.&mdash;I can &s;carcely form an idea of Lady Lyttelton pre&s;iding over a Dairy, any more than I &s;hould of the vene|rable Dean, if you told me he preferred a modern Guinea to a copper Otho.</P>

<P>THIS is, upon my honour, the fir&s;t moment I have been able to hold a pen &s;ince I received your obliging letter; and I was unwilling to &s;end without writing, or dictating at lea&s;t; but I could do neither. Lane would have wrote of her own accord; and I would have permitted her, had I con|&s;ulted merely good manners; but friend&s;hip would have remained un&s;atisfied, and the de|licacy of yours might have made you &s;ugge&s;t that I was more dangerou&s;ly ill than I really was.</P>
<P>My di&s;order proceeded I believe from a cold I got the day we went to &s;ee the Monu|ment: and after you left Barrells, it turned to a fever of a &s;low kind, chiefly nervous, attended with pains in my bowels, which, added to want of re&s;t, have weakened me &s;o much, that I have not yet cro&s;&s;ed my room; nor have I &s;een a mortal except Doctor

Whenever I do hear, I will make her your &s;up|pliant compliment, and make no doubt but you will &s;oon be forgiven.</P>
<P>I rejoice that you and Lord Dudley were not the wor&s;e for your di&s;agreeable journey. I &s;hall, for the future, hold the Saracen's Head in great e&s;teem for having &s;hewn you the ho&s;pi|tality it once denied me.&mdash;I beg of you to make my be&s;t compliments to his Lord&s;hip, with many thanks for his kind vi&s;it, which gave me great plea&s;ure.&mdash;Do this by letter, if he is out of the country.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Bradley are plea&s;ed and ho|noured with your kind remembrance; and it was as welcome in your Po&s;t&s;cript as if it had been in a higher place.

<P>IT is true the time has appeared long &s;ince I heard from you; but mo&s;t of it has been a &s;eries of &s;uch very bad weather, that I would not have bought even the plea|&s;ure of a letter from you at the expence of the hazards my friend Thomas mu&s;t have run in bringing it. Were I to tell him &s;o, he would not conceive how great a compliment I paid him;
<PB N="325" REF="332" MS="Y">
nor can you, Sir, unle&s;s you gue&s;s at the degree of joy you afford me each time you write. Yours, at hearing from me, would perhaps be reciprocal, if I could entertain you as well: but alas! how far &s;hort am I of being able to entertain you at all! particularly at this time, that my &s;pirits are not only depre&s;&s;ed with what affects yours, as &s;olitude, winter &s;torms, and more heavy winter evenings, but al&s;o by the &s;torm my Daughter's imprudence (to call it by no wor&s;e a name) has rai&s;ed not only in her family, but in the world. This melancholy &s;cene to her friends is I &s;uppo&s;e an amu&s;ement to the public, and will &s;hortly be a &s;till greater one, who will divert them|&s;elves at her and her favourite's expence, whil&s;t her Hu&s;band and Friends lament her folly.&mdash;I had a letter of condolence to-day upon this &s;ub|ject, which is no &s;ecret one, from the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et; but, as it is a kind of &s;ermon, I will &s;pare you &s;o &s;erious an epi&s;tle, which will be more u&s;eful when your &s;pirits are too much enlivened, (if they ever are &s;o) than at this languid &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;I de&s;ire you will not fail to write to Mr. Greaves for the Ode, that I may keep my word with Her Grace: and when you write, a&s;&s;ure him of my e&s;teem, and make my compliments to his agreeable Wife.&mdash;I re|turn

the enamelled Label for a bottle, which I &s;uppo&s;e is meant for him. The de&s;ign of it is exceedingly pretty; and I &s;hould not &s;o long have deprived him of the plea&s;ure of &s;ee|ing it, had I not waited for your &s;ervant to carry it &s;afe, who, by the way, was &s;o kind to bring me a pretty large book from Aris, who bound it for me: it is called <Q>&startq;Memoirs of &endq;&s;everal learned Ladies of Great Britain."</Q> I have not read it; and &s;hould not have &s;ub|&s;cribed to it, but to oblige a Lady who de|&s;ired me, having no idea of its merit; therefore I do not &s;end it you: be&s;ides, how &s;hould tru&s;ty Tom be able to carry that, and with it thirteen more things I load him with, to leave at Birmingham? viz. 1&s;t, a jack for boots; 2dly, a reading-de&s;k; 3dly, a cribbage-board; 4thy, a pair of &s;nuffers; 5thly, a ruler; 6thly, an eighteen-inch rule; three pair of nutcrackers make nine things; a lemon-&s;queezer, ten; two candle&s;ticks make twelve; a piquet-board, thirteen:&mdash;but le&s;t you &s;hould think the bur|then too great for your man or your hor&s;e, be it known that the&s;e thirteen u&s;eful things go all into one coat-pocket, and are made out of one piece of mahogany, eighteen inches long, when open, nine when &s;hut, and barely five broad. Mr. John Reynalds brought this Pro|teus
<PB N="327" REF="334">
ye&s;terday to &s;hew me, and I &s;end it to have one made by it, fir&s;t, for the curio&s;ity of this maggotty invention; &s;econdly, for the u&s;e of it, when it is in the &s;hape of a reading-de&s;k. I &s;aw him take his boots off with it with ea&s;e; and I believe it is equally good as a lemon|&s;queezer. I think a place might be contrived to let in a &s;mall ink-bottle and a pen: but as it was invented by a <HI>General</HI>, that uten&s;il gave place to others more immediately nece&s;&s;ary to his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But now for Egoti&s;m (for you a&s;k after me, and mu&s;t be obeyed): I have never been below &s;tairs &s;ince I wrote to you la&s;t, and never but once &s;ince I &s;aw you, and that was &s;o long ago as New-year's-day, when I went down, for a very few dull hours, and have been ill &s;ince; but am now pretty well; and my lower rooms have had fires made in them &s;ome days, by way of preparing them for the reception of my per|&s;on, which moves but &s;lowly towards them; though I believe I &s;hall go down the ladder, if any charitable per&s;on comes to receive me at the bottom. I expected it would have been Mrs. Davies with her Mother-in-law, Mrs. Bartlet, for whom I offered to &s;end my chai&s;e to-morrow; but they choo&s;e to defer their vi&s;it one or two days. As to Mrs. Holy|oak,
<PB N="328" REF="335">
who <HI>was</HI> a very chearful neighbour, &s;he has never been here &s;ince the death of her &s;e|cond &s;on (who&s;e death, by the way, is rather good than ill fortune to his family); and Mr. Holyoak has been here but once, though it is above &s;ix weeks ago; and Mi&s;s Molly lives at Worce&s;ter.&mdash;Mr. Allen is dead.&mdash;Mr. Bradley has been at London, but called on me ye&s;ter|day; as did Dr. Wall on Sunday, who tells me a turnpike-road is to be made (by an Act of Parliament promoted by Sir George Lyttel|ton) from Stourbridge to Brom&s;grove; and, by Lord Plymouth's de&s;ire, on to <HI>Hewell</HI>, and to Crabbs Cro&s;s; which la&s;t place is but &s;ix miles off; and from it one enters upon the Ridgeway.

It is true the in|vitation is mercenary, and nothing as yet makes Barrells a de&s;irable re&s;idence: the Aviary is unpeopled, the Garden produces only &s;now|drops, crocu&s;es, &amp;c. and all the melody of the Grove is the voice of rooks; but &s;eeing them build (which they have begun to do) introduces

As to my only near neighbours, I give up the thoughts of ex|pecting it; for I neither &s;ee nor hear any thing from them, but by their &s;ervant-boy, who comes regularly three times a week to de&s;ire the News-paper.</P>

intere&s;ts me, as he was my Brother: perhaps it may not intere&s;t you; in which ca&s;e you need not read it.&mdash;Neither Poetry nor Plays have approached me of a long &s;ea&s;on, and news I learn only from the wor&s;t hands, viz. the news-paper writers. My corre&s;pondents are few: the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et is too much retired to hear of what pa&s;&s;es, and is too much wrapt up in religious and moral reflections to admit of other &s;ubjects in her letters.&mdash;Sir William Meredith and his Si&s;ters are not yet arrived at London. Sir Peter Soame lives almo&s;t always in the country; and Outing is too lazy to write a line more than he is obliged to.

to <HI>my&s;elf</HI> it is unknown; and all the intelli|gence I have from it is by a few &s;nowdrops and polyanthu&s;es, which are daily &s;ent as amba&s;|&s;adors into my chamber, tied up in a no&s;egay, but in no ways inviting, though joined with the <HI>kind</HI> laure&s;tinus, who is indeed a <HI>friend in di&s;tre&s;s</HI>, (as you called him) and is mo&s;t wel|come in winter: but I could almo&s;t wi&s;h to have him out of &s;ight, and even the <HI>Robin</HI>'s &s;weet note out of hearing, as they remind me of the melancholy winter that is &s;carcely pa&s;t; and nothing agreeable as yet denotes approaching Spring. I &s;et Mrs. Davies to tran&s;cribe the Green Book, and began it my&s;elf: it was not quite fini&s;hed, &s;o &s;he carried it to Stratford; but it is &s;afe, and almo&s;t done, and you &s;hall have the copy. But where are the pretty paintings I was to have? You &s;ee how covetous I am, and how a little received makes me gra&s;p at more: but as covetou&s;ne&s;s is in&s;atiable, &s;o is your fund of &s;upplying it inexhau&s;tible.</P>
<P>I expect Sir William Meredith &s;oon, who will I hope tell me news, or bring me new things to read; all which is uncertain: in the mean time, I have read the <HI>Game&s;ter</HI> and the <HI>Brothers</HI>, and a book called <HI>Manners</HI>. As to the <HI>Game&s;ter</HI>, you have undoubtedly read it:
<PB N="333" REF="340" MS="Y">
it is true it draws tears, and &s;eems adapted to do good, which I heartily wi&s;h it may; but it is much upon a footing with <HI>George Barn|well</HI>; and in my mind, the heroine's genero|&s;ity and good nature is rather over&s;trained: but tho&s;e who paint for the &s;tage mu&s;t draw larger than life. The <HI>Brothers</HI> I have al&s;o read, and believe it to be a well-wrote piece; but as it is poetry, you are the be&s;t judge. I find it is liked, and, I think, with rea&s;on. The Bricklayer's performance is a &s;urprizing one in him, and has to be &s;ure infinitely more &s;pirit than the other tragedy called al&s;o <HI>The Earl of E&s;&s;ex</HI>; but I never was fond of the &s;ubject. As the&s;e plays will fill but a corner of my &s;ervant's pockets, I &s;end them, though well per&s;uaded you mu&s;t have read them; but he can ea&s;ily bring them back. With them goes Voltaire's Defence of my Brother Bolingbroke's Letters, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Did your man &s;hew you the little jack for boots, and all the apparatus? If it is at Birmingham to be copied for me, Jo&s;eph may a&s;k after it; for I order him to return that way with a compliment to my relation Captain Somervile, who is quartered there, and who lay here with Mr. John Reynalds a week ago: it is Lord Somervile's <HI>elde&s;t</HI> Son I mean; he

I find <HI>your</HI> Beauty Lady Diana Egerton is married, but not to the lover I &s;aw her with the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on that I was at Bath.&mdash;Mr. Outing is, I believe, at London, in Charles Court; but not an echo &s;peaks his name to me, nor does a po&s;tboy bring a line from him.

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU may be certain that I have been ill, &s;ince you have not had a letter from me of &s;o long a time; for, next to conver&s;ing with you, nothing plea&s;es me &s;o much as cor|re&s;ponding with you by letter. When Mr. Pixell was la&s;t here, I was &s;o little able to an&s;wer the obliging letter you wrote by him, that I could not &s;o much as &s;ee him; for I was in bed all day. I &s;hould have rejoiced to have contributed towards his Son's &s;ucce&s;s, in what he de&s;ired to obtain at Stratford; but unfortunately I have no intere&s;t there: Mrs. Kendall gone to Lord Exeter's, and Mrs. Davies gone to London,&mdash;to whom could I apply? (for Mr. Payton he was &s;ure of before, as well as of Mr. Kendrick) yet I did venture to write
<PB N="336" REF="343">
to Mr. Brigham and Mrs. Bartlet: the former was from home, but has &s;ince &s;ent me the in|clo&s;ed an&s;wer; and Mrs. Davies has al&s;o wrote me a line about it, which I inclo&s;e. I advi&s;ed with Mr. John Reynalds about the affair, who &s;aid there was no way he knew of, but for Mr. Pixell, the Father, to go and canva&s;s, and get nine or ten Aldermen together and make them drunk, and con&s;equently they would be friends to his Son.&mdash;It is too true that this kind of proceeding prevails in England much &s;ooner than merit.</P>
<P>I find your neighbours and mine echo each other, <HI>Air and exerci&s;e! air and exerci&s;e!</HI> and we no &s;ooner obey but we get cold, and become incapable of even taking the air and exerci&s;e which the hou&s;e and gardens afford. I am &s;ure I find it &s;o; for though I am better in health, I have &s;uch a violent pain in my face and teeth, that I can get no &s;leep, nor apply my&s;elf to any thing. This, added to my low|ne&s;s of &s;pirits, will certainly in&s;pire me with very <HI>bright thoughts</HI> to adorn my letter! but if dulne&s;s is my lot, I cannot help it, and you are too candid not to pardon me, though I 'numb you with it.</P>
<P>I &s;ent my hor&s;es to London la&s;t Wedne&s;day to fetch Mrs. Davies and my new po&s;t-chariot.
<PB N="337" REF="344">
I expect to &s;ee them on Monday at farthe&s;t, and then will take from her the copies &s;he has wrote out of your Green Book, which &s;he locked up at Stratford before &s;he went her journey. Your <HI>other Green Book</HI> is a curio&s;ity more worthy Dean Lyttelton; but is far from dimini&s;hing my real value for the unadorned, unembelli&s;hed, un-illuminated Green Book, which you allow me to call my own.&mdash;But to return to the la&s;t Green Book: I mu&s;t &s;ay it is beautifully illuminated, and the gilding is, in my mind, &s;urprizingly well laid on; and as to the price, you mu&s;t have paid the man with indulgences; for the money you gave is in no ways adequate to the value. I never &s;aw but one like it, and it is the property of Sir William Meredith, who&s;e merit you extol in &s;ix as elegant lines as I ever read. I want to &s;ee the whole copy of ver&s;es complete; and I much want to &s;ee you two here together. If I have not that &s;atisfaction, the fault will be yours.&mdash;I expect him &s;oon. He is at Wi|gan in Lanca&s;hire, making intere&s;t to be cho|&s;en Member of Parliament: his Si&s;ters are at London in a new hou&s;e he has taken, except the Counte&s;s Ferrers, who is already gone out of town, and I believe was there but a few weeks.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="345" MS="Y">I congratulate you upon Mr. Hylton's be|coming your neighbour: he &s;eemed to me of a gentle di&s;po&s;ition, and capable of being a good friend, as well as de&s;irous of becoming one by his obliging behaviour.&mdash;Your corre&s;pondence with Lord Dudley cannot be otherwi&s;e than amu&s;ing and in&s;tructive; for you &s;ay you <HI>&s;eldom write to him, and never hear from him</HI>. I ima|gine the ca&s;e is much the &s;ame between you and Outing; from whom I hear occa&s;ionally, but &s;eldom; and &s;carcely ever but upon bu&s;ine&s;s. Mr. Reynalds tells me he &s;till complains of his pupil, who is not yet gone to &s;ea.&mdash;The two Captains Somervile are at Litchfield on ac|count of the Review.</P>
<P>P. S. The <HI>Moralities</HI> and <HI>Crito</HI> I &s;end back: the former is certainly <HI>trite</HI>-i&s;&s;imo; the latter is the rever&s;e. I have read with plea&s;ure the new Tran&s;lation from <HI>Solez</HI> of the Conque&s;t of Mexico, corrected by Mr. Hook, Author of the Roman Hi&s;tory; and find it &s;ets that event in a new light by the old author, and in much newer and better language than we have ever &s;een it before, by means of the new tran&s;lation. &mdash;What you &s;ay of Mademoi&s;elle Maintenon's Letters is perfectly true; but I could not have known how to &s;ay it, though I felt it; &s;o little
<PB N="339" REF="346">
of a critic am I; and yet I think I could cri|ticize upon her &s;entiments, which, when com|pared with her actions, &s;eem not a little hypo|critical. We &s;hall &s;ee her Life in print &s;hortly, and then we may judge better, if it is wrote fairly.</P>
<P>I ju&s;t now have &s;ent for the <HI>learned Mr. Hume</HI>, my Gardener, to con&s;ult about your hot-bed for melons. He a&s;&s;ures me it is too late to aim at having any <HI>this</HI> year; but will direct your man how to proceed again&s;t the <HI>next</HI>. Had you wrote about it in your la&s;t letter, I could not only have a&s;&s;i&s;ted you with advice, but al&s;o with &s;eeds and plants.&mdash;I have exceeding fine anemonies, but the Gardener &s;ays they will die long before they get to you; other|wi&s;e you &s;hould have had a <HI>po&s;ie to wear on your brea&s;t</HI>.&mdash;I am promi&s;ed a cornel tree; but mu&s;t wait till September.</P>
<P>I could laugh (if you would forgive it) at <HI>you</HI> and your <HI>apothecary</HI>; the one fears the &s;teeple will fall on his head, and therefore dreads the &s;ound of the bells: the other lives a mile or two off, and gives money to have tho&s;e bells made harmonious, though he cannot hear them: the latter has to be &s;ure a more public &s;pirit, and the other a more prudential one, according to the &s;elf-intere&s;ted &s;cheme of
<PB N="340" REF="347">
things. Upon the whole, I vote for no bells ringing when Lord Dudley comes into the country, but tho&s;e pretty ones I was &s;o fond of hearing in your hall; and methinks I would go and join chorus,
<Q>"Down with your Caps to the Ground, Boys:"</Q>
but fir&s;t, Sir, be plea&s;ed to come here, and &s;ee the &s;pontaneous beauties of my Coppice; for you never come till they have run their race, and are no more. In &s;hort, if you will not come &s;oon, I will not go to the Lea&s;owes at all. By the way in which you take this threat, I &s;hall know if you choo&s;e my company.&mdash;Be &s;o good as to let my Gardener &s;ee Lord Dudley's Green-Hou&s;e and Hot-Hou&s;es: he begged leave to &s;ee the Lea&s;owes; and as you had a&s;ked him, I could not well refu&s;e.</P>
<P>Your idea of the ink-&s;tand's preventing the new machine from being u&s;eful as a pair of breeches, made me laugh (though alone) &s;o loud, that Lane heard me. She pre&s;ents her re&s;pects, and I my affectionate compliments.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR two letters arriving almo&s;t in the &s;ame minute, rou&s;ed me in &s;ome mea|&s;ure out of the lethargic di&s;po&s;ition, or rather the heavy &s;tupefaction I have been oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome time, notwith&s;tanding what I have &s;uffered, and do &s;uffer, by a violent pain in my face and teeth, enough to have given &s;pirits, though not by an agreeable method; whereas mine are as dejected as you can po&s;&s;ibly ima|gine; and I &s;ee no immediate rea&s;on to hope their &s;peedy amendment.</P>
<P>I very &s;eldom have vi&s;ited my Shrubbery; and have then been obliged to be often &s;up|ported, or to &s;it down: and as to my new chai&s;e, (which is a chariot, or rather a landau|let, only drawn as a po&s;t-chai&s;e) I have been in it but twice, and then forced in. The la&s;t time was only to Oldbarrow, about four days ago, and have not recovered the fatigue yet, nor been down &s;tairs but once. This grim de&s;cription of my&s;elf will not recommend me
<PB N="342" REF="349">
as a companion or a corre&s;pondent; but I am equally a friend; for my &s;entiments, thank God, are not infected, though my &s;pirits and body &s;uffer. I am &s;orry you are inclinable to &s;uch dejection, which I know &s;o well how to pity: but hope you will &s;hake it off with more ea&s;e, and that I &s;hall &s;ee you bri&s;k and bonny at this place ere long, with your good and agreeable Friend.</P>
<P>I will not fail to &s;end your packet to the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et, and to obey all your commands; but it is too big for the po&s;t.&mdash;I have read the Ode, and think it can receive no amendment.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand that Mr. Hylton and Mi&s;s Rock both come down with Lord Dudley, and that Mi&s;s L&mdash; is jealous of Mi&s;s R&mdash;, who it &s;eems is very pretty; and that they are to &s;top in Buckingham&s;hire, in their way.</P>
<P>The plural number concerning letters, in the fir&s;t line of mine, may puzzle you; but means the letter you &s;ent me to-day by tru&s;ty Thomas, as al&s;o that you wrote (in part to me) to Mrs. Davies, dated the 9th, which &s;he &s;ent for my peru&s;al ju&s;t before your &s;ervant came in; and it rejoiced me to find you had remembered, when I feared the contrary. I have never &s;een

<P>Being really too weak to fini&s;h copying the Green Book, I &s;end as far as Mrs. Davies wrote, and the titles of the remainder.</P>
<P>The notion of a turnpike plea&s;es me much, hoping it facilitates the way to the Lea&s;owes: but you &s;hould have gone to Hagley. I preach, you find; but how do I practi&s;e? Helas!&mdash; Lady Plymouth, Lady Archer, &amp;c. are in the neighbourhood, and I in my chimney-corner.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I could &s;ee Mrs. Donolly's Accu&s;ation, and Mr. Outing's Vindication, in a Maga|zine.</P>
<P>Adieu. So bad a pen, &s;o bad a head, &s;o bad &s;pirits, ought not to trouble you longer: yet, under all the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, you will ever find me</P>

I therefore tell you my&s;elf, that I am <HI>tolerably</HI> well; I might &s;ay <HI>very</HI> well, if I had more &s;tre$$th; but that nervous di&s;order, which has long affected my &s;pirits, and which affected my limbs (particularly my hands) when at Bath, is de&s;cended to my legs, which have been

The wor&s;t effect of all the&s;e complaints is my being deprived of the plea&s;ure of ranging over the charming Lea|&s;owes all day, and of enjoying your conver&s;a|tion there; but, le&s;t you &s;hould think me wor&s;e than I am, I mu&s;t tell you that I am ju&s;t come into the hou&s;e from the Summer-hou&s;e, where I drank tea with Mrs. Bartlet, Mrs. Davies, Mr. Holyoak, and Mr. John Reynalds: the two latter we have left at bowls by moon-light.

<P>I think the inundation of fine company you have had at the Lea&s;owes mu&s;t have been an additional ornament to that charming place; and the place mu&s;t have given them real plea|&s;ure, as they are people of ta&s;te.&mdash;All the

<P>EVERY in&s;tance of your partial friend&s;hip gives me a plea&s;ure, which would be per|fect, was it not attended by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of not meriting that partiality which I am proud of. This reflection humbles me; and I mu&s;t own that what you call <HI>brightne&s;s</HI> in me, is only borrowed, as that of the moon; and is owing to your neighbourhood, and even to your corre&s;pondence; which when I am deprived of, I remain a dull inanimate lump.&mdash; Your concern for my health &s;hews your good nature; which I ought to repay by following your advice&punc; but the weather often ob&s;tructs my performances in my po&s;t-chai&s;e, which I think were to be very frequent, according to your pre&s;cription and Sir Peter Soame's; but I go frequently as far as my neighbour Mrs. Bradley's, who is not able to come to me at pre&s;ent, being near lying-in. As to my vi&s;it to the Lea&s;owes, I want neither your per&s;ua|&s;ions, nor Dr. Wall's advice, to induce me to it; my own inclination bia&s;&s;ing me that way
<PB N="348" REF="355">
more than any bribe could bia&s;s a mercenary voter at an election; &s;o that a &s;un-&s;hiny week, a continuance of my pre&s;ent degree of health, and a little better u&s;e of my legs, would cer|tainly &s;uffer me to be attracted by the charms of the <HI>renowned Lea&s;owes</HI>, who&s;e power draws Beaux, Belles, Poets, Senators, &amp;c. to pay ho|mage to them. Glad I am that &s;o much good ta&s;te is left in our nation; and proud I am that I had ju&s;t enough to di&s;cover its beauties before it had received the benefit of the poli&s;h|ing you have &s;ince be&s;towed upon it. Na|ture and you went hand in hand to perfect it. Nature will per&s;i&s;t in her work.&mdash;Pray do not you be idle, but let the applau&s;e of the polite encourage you.

<P>I wi&s;h my pen could keep pace with my thoughts; your letter would be an&s;wered more fully; but you know my hands and legs have not been of late famous for agility: yet you encourage me greatly as to one of my inabi|lities, by telling me that mo&s;t of your vi&s;itants are <HI>mi&s;erable walkers</HI>; and I &s;hall plume my&s;elf with the remembrance of having been a better one not long &s;ince, which enabled me to par|take of the di&s;tant as well as of the near pro|&s;pects of your farm, and will again re&s;tore me, as I hope, to that of vi&s;iting every corner of your Grove at lea&s;t: the other wood might be too a&s;piring; &s;o I dare not mention it, but &s;hall admire it with uplifted eyes.</P>
<P>Now for the Election. As to the particular an&s;wer to every point which I could have wi&s;hed to &s;end you, I mu&s;t be deficient to|night. You &s;ent late. I am ignorant &s;o much as of Mr. Coventry's friends or his enemies.

<P>As for you; Sir, you want not, I hope, fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances of my friend&s;hip; and for proofs of it, let but fortune put it in my power, and do you command as ha&s;tily as you plea&s;e, you &s;hall be obeyed by</P>

By means of Mr. Holyoak I got &s;ome names of freehold|ers, with whom both he and I will u&s;e our intere&s;t in favour of Mr. Coventry. If you know of any be&s;ides tho&s;e named in this li&s;t, be plea&s;ed to &s;end me their names. Lord Archer made me a vi&s;it to-day: I &s;poke to him upon this affair, and found that he and Lord Plymouth were in the intere&s;t of Mr. Coventry as &s;trongly as we could wi&s;h; how|ever, I gave him, by his own de&s;ire, the inclo&s;ed little li&s;t which I got from Mr. Holyoak. As to Mr. Packwood, Lord Archer and we &s;up|po&s;e him to be engaged on the other &s;ide. There are voters who live at Tanworth: I make no doubt but Lord Archer &s;ecures them, as he appears to be zealous in the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Holyoak de&s;ires his compliments to you, and &s;ays he is wholly at your &s;ervice for whatever intere&s;t he can make: and you give me plea&s;ure by affording me an occa&s;ion of

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CANNOT forbear reflecting upon your kindne&s;s to your friends in general, and to me in particular. Your obliging letter came ju&s;t <HI>&agrave; propos</HI> to rouze me from an unplea&s;ing, in|active, and wor&s;e than lethargic &s;tate of body; for as to my mind, it is ever waking and intent upon my friends; nor do they lo&s;e one &s;cruple of the regard I owe them, by my not expre&s;&s;ing it with my pen; nor do they lo&s;e an in&s;tant of plea&s;ure by my &s;ilence; for what can <HI>I</HI> &s;ay to plea&s;e, who hear nothing to plea&s;e my&s;elf? But no more of this.&mdash;Be a&s;&s;ured my friend&s;hip
<PB N="353" REF="360">
retains its full weight, and is neither <HI>e&s;tranged</HI> from you, nor in the lea&s;t dimini&s;hed. Your merit and my e&s;teem &s;ecure it yours.</P>
<P>I am a&s;hamed of my&s;elf when I name your Ode. I am guilty, I confe&s;s, of having de|prived Her Grace of it long; but I am al&s;o innocent of any artifice in my &s;eeming neglect; only I did not meet with any body I could tru&s;t with it that was going towards Her Grace's habitation, and the little book was too big and heavy for a frank; but at la&s;t I have &s;ent it, and hope to give you her an&s;wer about Dod&s;ley's printing it ere long; and in the mean time flatter my&s;elf no fal&s;e edition by piracy, &amp;c. can happen to be publi&s;hed: be that as it will, I &s;hall take the blame upon my&s;elf for my delay, and &s;hall excu&s;e you to my Friend the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et; who is too benign to accu&s;e us, as &s;he mu&s;t know we mean her well; and I do not doubt but &s;he will permit Dod&s;ley to print it, and that with plea&s;ure. You was kind in contributing &s;omething of Mr. Whi&s;tler's and Mr. Graves's to his Mi&s;cellanies: Would I were capable of adding a line to them worth reading! but I am no Poete&s;s: if I was, the Lea&s;owes and its Owner &s;hould &s;till be my theme.</P>
<P>Mrs. Davies has left me to horrid &s;olitude;
<PB N="354" REF="361">
b$$ has left the re&s;t of your Poems, which $word$ $nclo&s;e. You will, methinks, &s;tare at the epithet <HI>horrid</HI> which I have annexed to <HI>&s;olitude</HI>; as that u&s;ed to plea&s;e me, and be called <HI>&s;weet</HI> at lea&s;t: but changes of one kind bring on changes of another, even without being owing to ficklene&s;s, as my life has proved to me; yet my ta&s;tes are the &s;ame; and I had rather now deck a rural bower than glitter on a birthnight at court: but as we are all made for &s;ociety, the lo&s;s of neighbours and of limbs, make the&s;e bowers more irk&s;ome than inviting. I am, however, much better in health and limbs than when you &s;aw me, and do not de&s;pair of mea&s;uring your walks once more at lea&s;t with my &s;teps: provided you come in the mean time to do the &s;ame to mine; why not? Winter is your &s;ea&s;on of appearing: the Lea&s;owes has too many charms, and attracts too good company to be left in Summer: but our country hearts and hearths may be as hone&s;t, pert, and jovial, as any your pari&s;hion|ers can afford you; and at <HI>more</HI> we &s;hall not a&s;pire&mdash;Come el&s;e and &s;ee. Outing will be here &s;oon, I &s;uppo&s;e; for the roads of the Vale of Eve&s;ham frighten him from the thoughts of coming from Somervile's A&s;ton hither, when they are at the wor&s;t. Par&s;on Holyoak went
<PB N="355" REF="362">
with him thither, and &s;taid a few days; and al&s;o went to Hewell with him, where (according to the news-paper's phra&s;e) they were <HI>mo&s;t gra|ciou&s;ly received</HI>.&mdash;The <HI>great</HI> Mr. We&s;t of the Trea&s;ury &s;ent his gardener to-day to view my &s;mall Garden and my Walks; which I won|der at, as him&s;elf had &s;een them before, and mu&s;t know they would not teach or &s;erve as examples to his &s;ervant.</P>
<P>I did not think of making <HI>more la&s;t words</HI>; but I cannot go to bed without congratulating you upon the polite company you have re|ceived at the Lea&s;owes. I am vain methinks that what I &s;o much approved when in its cradle, &s;hould become the re&s;ort and envy of the <HI>beau monde</HI>, in &s;pite of the roads and weather.</P>
<P>I am glad you do Lord Pl&mdash;'s good na|ture and politene&s;s the ju&s;tice it de&s;erves. I had a few lines from him and his Lady to-day; &s;he is a de&s;erving and amiable woman. I am glad you will advi&s;e as to their improvements without doors; for they intend right as to the in&s;ide. <HI>Mais les pauvres environs re&s;teront en defaut.</HI> The approach of the waters to the hou&s;e will, I fear, produce more agues than good fi&s;h, or plea&s;ant views to the place. I am much obliged to Sir George Lyttelton; had I
<PB N="356" REF="363">
power, he might command it, or you for him.</P>
<P>I hear the oppo&s;ition as to the Election is &s;topped, and hear it with plea&s;ure. I envy you &s;ome of your company more than that of your antediluvian, though Reverend, <HI>Beed</HI>, and that of your Gothic, though modern, Miller.&mdash;I am glad Hagley is to &s;tand in a rational place, as it has a rational ma&s;ter, and has lo&s;t its unra|tional controller, the late gardener of it.</P>
<P>I cannot be &s;orry Mr. Hylton has <HI>hauled</HI> his thou&s;and pounds back, or is &s;o to do. It is far better to <HI>haul</HI> his money, than a <HI>pertui&s;ane</HI>, or whatever el&s;e is the name of the tall thing they haul. As to <HI>the bottle</HI>, and what was <HI>over the bottle</HI>, you may a&s;&s;ure him I never ventured to let Mr. Ou&mdash;g &s;ee it; for what might have en&s;ued? No, Sir, I would not offend any <HI>officer</HI> in the King's troops.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry Lord Dudley's toe has been &s;o offended by his <HI>bed's foot</HI>, of which he &s;hould be cautious for the future, as I fear the damages would rather upon trial fall on his Lord&s;hip than on <HI>that</HI> offender. I beg my be&s;t re&s;pects to his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>Par&s;on Holyoak, &amp;c. are your obedient &s;er|vants. Mrs Bradley is recovering from a dangerous lying-in; and Mrs. Davies is at

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I undertake to write to you to-night, I do not know how my letter is to be wafted to Birmingham, unle&s;s &s;ome kind Sylph offers her &s;ervice; the terre&s;trial me&s;&s;engers not being able to travel, at lea&s;t not in this country, where it &s;nows, rains, and freezes, not alternately, but at the &s;ame time. Is that your ca&s;e in Shrop&s;hire? If &s;o, I pity you; but I think you and I, who have not much el&s;e to do, &s;hould utter our lamentations to each other from the corners of the &s;ame chim|ney. Sharing the burthen of winter would be le&s;&s;ening it to each of us. I cannot go to the Lea&s;owes; <HI>ergo</HI> you mu&s;t come to Barrells, or we cannot meet. Is not this true rea&s;oning? You will &s;ay (and perhaps with truth) that it
<PB N="361" REF="368">
is like an invitation to a funeral; which, I am per&s;uaded, is a compliment mo&s;t people would be glad not to receive; but though it could not entertain you to accept of &s;uch an invita|tion, it would illu&s;trate your friendly qualities, by affording you an opportunity of giving, rather than of receiving, plea&s;ure. The word <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> reminds me that I have received a very agreeable epi&s;tle from your Friend Mr. Hylton, who&s;e lo&s;s of a place at Court does not &s;eem to &s;it heavy upon him. It is no more than I expected from the good &s;en&s;e I ob&s;erved in him.</P>
<P>I return you the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et's letter; and have methinks too long forborne &s;colding you for imagining Her Grace's meaning to be that you &s;hould not print your Poem upon Rural Ta&s;te. On the contrary, &s;he is, I am &s;ure, proud of its being in&s;cribed to her, though too ba&s;hful, in her retirement, to choo&s;e her name to be at the head of it; yet well knowing with inward &s;atisfaction, that every body will know &s;he is the Heroine of the piece, as much as one knows who was Waller's Sacchari&s;&s;a, without reading her real name at the top. Had our Duche&s;s not intended you &s;hould publi&s;h it, what need had &s;he to enjoin <HI>&s;tars</HI> or <HI>da&s;hes</HI> in|&s;tead of her and of her habitation's names?
<PB N="362" REF="369">
Do not deprive the public of the plea&s;ure they would have in reading it, and do not deprive Her Grace of the compliment you intended her, and which &s;o much &s;eems to plea&s;e her, both by the letters &s;he writes to me as well as to your&s;elf about it. In an&s;wer to your que&s;tion, I can &s;incerely a&s;&s;ure you, that I never once thought of the Duche&s;s's refu&s;al, nor do I call it one now; and am certain &s;he means no more than what &s;he expre&s;&s;es to you about &s;uppre&s;&s;ing her name; &s;o that your <HI>vanity</HI>, were it ever &s;o great, would not be really hurt by this, which your <HI>imagination</HI> only deems a di&s;ap|pointment.</P>
<P>Your Ver&s;es to Lady Plymouth (who&s;e name is Catherine) plea&s;e me greatly, and &s;he as greatly merits your prai&s;e. Your expre&s;&s;ion in the la&s;t line ought to be far from di&s;plea&s;ing Lord Plymouth, and is, in my mind, more proper and more elegant than any feigned name you could give him. I cannot but &s;ay I &s;hould rather wi&s;h the in&s;cription, being to a Lady, had been in Engli&s;h. Could not that have been, and yet Horace's Latin motto have been pre&s;erved? but I am no critic, having neither capacity nor inclination to be one; &s;o that what I &s;ay upon &s;uch &s;ubjects &s;hould be wrote in &s;and.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I &s;ent my &s;ervant to the Lea|&s;owes, I was very well: when he re|turned, I had got a bad cold, cough, and fever. When <HI>your</HI> &s;ervant came here, I had lo&s;t the two latter complaints; but was &s;till too much out of order with my cold and &s;ore throat, to be able to hold a pen, or even to dictate; and have kept my bed &s;everal days &s;ince that; but am re&s;olved to write now, though my eyes &s;mart for it. Far better it is to &s;mart than to have even the appearance of ingratitude, or of neglecting tho&s;e one profe&s;&s;es a friend&s;hip for. This is <HI>no</HI> florid excu&s;e, but is the real opinion of me your culprit, who cannot &s;o well excu&s;e my&s;elf for the impolitene&s;s of letting your &s;ervant go back without the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et's letter, and Mr. Hylton's, which you had &s;ent me to peru&s;e; but the forget|fulne&s;s proceeded from having company at cards, and talking round me.&mdash;Though I con|gratulated Mr. Hylton upon his di&s;appoint|ment
<PB N="373" REF="380">
in the affair he had engaged in, and thought he had no great lo&s;s in being deprived of the <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> of carrying a <HI>battle-ax</HI>; yet I as &s;incerely regret your having mi&s;&s;ed the oppor|tunity, which &s;eemed to throw it&s;elf in your way, of executing a more agreeable office without toil, and one both honourable, and at|tended with great conveniencies to a country gentleman, who choo&s;es to be exempted from &s;ome <HI>&s;tupid</HI> or <HI>turbulent</HI> offices in his county. Such would have been your ca&s;e, had you been Sir R. Lyttelton's E&s;quire, who&s;e Brother I think &s;hould have propo&s;ed it to you. It would have been friendly, neighbourly, and in no ways doing you a plea&s;ure at their own expence.&mdash;As to the account of your ill health, I am not di&s;po&s;ed to believe it (pardon me, Sir, for it was <HI>you</HI> complained); for I think <HI>your &s;olitude, your want of air to breathe, objects to con|ver&s;e with, inclemency of weather, privation from the amu&s;ements your own ta&s;te has procured you in your own environs</HI>; are all poi&s;ons imbibed in winter, and it is not <HI>bli&s;ters</HI>, &amp;c. &amp;c. that will expel them. Try the company of your di&s;tant friends; perhaps change of air and the exer|ci&s;e of travelling may perform miracles: if one place does not do, go to another; but pray begin by <HI>this</HI>, where I expect you daily. Mr.

Outing and I will nur&s;e you, and the bu&s;y rooks will tell you each morning that it is time to prepare for the fe&s;tivals of Spring, and to bury your complaints in old Winter's grave.</P>
<P>My kinde&s;t &s;ervice to Mrs. Rock, whom I &s;hall always be ready to oblige when in my power; and wi&s;h I could &s;erve her e&s;&s;entially, by contributing my intere&s;t with Lady North|umberland, in conjunction with the endeavours of her other friends, to place her Daughter about Lady Betty Percy: but unfortunately I cannot be deemed a proper negociator in this affair, having &s;ome time ago re&s;ented her Lady&s;hip's &s;pending a con&s;iderable time in my neighbourhood both at Lord Brook's and Lord Hertford's, and pa&s;&s;ing through Henley without calling or even <HI>&s;ending</HI> to me. This appeared to me unkind; and I could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing my opinion of it to the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et, who probably might &s;peak of it to her Daughter; from whom, how|ever, I have not heard, and to whom I have not wrote, nor would I <HI>begin</HI> by a&s;king a favour: all therefore I can do is to mention Mrs. Rocks's reque&s;t to the Duche&s;s; which I will do in a few days.</P>
<P>Is Boadicea a good play or a bad one? I

have not &s;een nor read it.&mdash;You frighten me with the prolix &s;tile of the Author of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's Memoirs: &s;o I defer read|ing that.&mdash;I thank you for the news articles of your letter; as al&s;o for acquainting me that Lord Dudley is well; to whom I beg my re&s;pects, and hope and &s;incerely wi&s;h the &s;ucce&s;s of his coal-mine.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EVERY day have I been in expectation of an an&s;wer from the Duche&s;s of Somer|&s;et to the letter I wrote Her Grace to recom|mend Mrs. Rock's Daughter; which I did in
<PB N="376" REF="383">
the &s;tronge&s;t manner I was capable of. No an&s;wer is come as yet; which may be owing to Her Grace's not having had a proper oppor|tunity of taking with the Counte&s;s of North|umberland about it. Be that as it will, I am determined not to defer longer than to-morrow &s;ending a &s;ervant to the Lea&s;owes to enquire after your health; but have ordered him not to &s;et out till the po&s;t is come in, becau&s;e if it &s;hould bring an an&s;wer from the Duche&s;s in the morning, it &s;hall go to you inclo&s;ed in this; in the mean time wi&s;hing it may be an agreeable one to Mrs. Rock, and con&s;equently to you and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed letter of reque&s;t to me cau&s;es me to make one to you; which is, dear Sir, that you will mention the affair to Lord Dudley from me, in behalf of the young clergyman who writes the letter. He was once at Barrells &s;ome days with Sir Peter Soame, to whom he is a neighbour. He appeared to me to be a very &s;ober, mode&s;t man. Want of preferment, and at la&s;t getting a trifling one, too little to live upon, (e&s;pecially for a married man) he $$n in debt, and has been &s;everely treated by his creditors, who would, if they could, have confined him, and taken from him the hone&s;t means by which he propo&s;ed to extricate him|&s;elf,
<PB N="377" REF="384">
and to do ju&s;tice to them. Fortune, how|ever, and good friends have hitherto prevented their de&s;igns, and have favoured him with &s;ome preferment at Sheerne&s;s (as you will read in his letter); but yet he fears his per&s;on is not &s;afe without &s;ome &s;ort of protection. Perhaps Lord Dudley may be able to give him a chap|lain&s;hip; which would greatly oblige me. Speak of it, pray, to his Lord&s;hip, and let me know his an&s;wer. I have declined writing to Mademoi&s;elle de Montandre for an Amba&s;&s;ador's protection, for particular rea&s;ons regarding only her and my&s;elf; and I am the more &s;olicitous to endeavour to &s;erve him another way, which makes me, I fear, too trouble&s;ome to Lord Dudley.</P>
<P>I have had a &s;econd letter from Mr. Hylton, but have not an&s;wered it, becau&s;e you &s;ay you expect him in the country; where I hope to &s;ee him with you at my hou&s;e.</P>
<P>My tedious cold, which torments me in all &s;hapes, &s;tupifies my brain, and makes me in|capable of writing more than to give Mr. Outing's compliments, and to a&s;&s;ure you of the friend&s;hip of</P>

<P>NOBODY is &s;o unfit as I to an&s;wer your agreeable letters; for were I ever &s;o capable of it, my fingers would not obey: the fro&s;t having made them almo&s;t as u&s;ele&s;s as when I went to Bath, and more painful; and my head has been &s;tupified eight weeks with a cold that is not only ob&s;tinate, but has taken as many different &s;hapes as Proteus, to torment me in various ways.&mdash;I am &s;orry for my friend Tom, who has, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;uffered as well as I, by the inclemency of the weather.</P>
<P>I have no new books, alas! to amu&s;e my&s;elf or you; &s;o can only return yours of Hogarth's with thanks. It &s;urprized me agreeably; for I had conceived the performance to be a &s;et of prints only, whereas I found a book which I did not imagine Hogarth capable of writing; for in his pencil I always confided, but never imagined his pen would have afforded me &s;o much plea&s;ure. As to his not fixing <HI>the preci&s;e degree of obliquity</HI>, which con&s;titutes beauty, I forgive him, becau&s;e I think the ta&s;k too hard
<PB N="381" REF="388">
to be performed literally; but yet he conveys an idea between his pencil and his pen, which makes one conceive his meaning pretty well.</P>
<P>When I write to the Duche&s;s of Somer&s;et, I will do it in the manner you de&s;ire, as to your Poem; and will al&s;o name Mrs. Rock's Daughter again; but fear the Duche&s;s (like my&s;elf) &s;ees &s;o few of the inhabitants of this terre&s;trial globe, that &s;he will not readily find a proper per&s;on to recommend her to as a Lady's woman, though I make no doubt but the young woman de&s;erves it. I &s;hould think Lady Elizabeth might with much propriety de&s;ire her Mamma to recommend her to &s;ome Lady; nor do I think Lady Northumberland would take it at all ami&s;s that Mi&s;s Rock a&s;ked the child that favour.&mdash;The inclo&s;ed will be teazing to you, as it is to me; for it vexes me not to be able to &s;erve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, who addre&s;s them&s;elves to me. You would how|ever be kind to me, and charitable to the poor man, if you could contrive a way how Lord Dudley might &s;erve him; and his Lord&s;hip would add to the favours he has always &s;hewn to me upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I will not po&s;itively &s;ay one word in behalf of <HI>indolence</HI>, &s;ince it keeps you by your fire|&s;ide,
<PB N="382" REF="389">
though by promi&s;e you ought to be by mine.</P>
<P>Had I not been extremely out of order, I would have &s;een Mr. Cotterell; but hope at lea&s;t that my &s;ervants have been civil to him. When he has fini&s;hed your Eolian harp, I be|lieve I &s;hall de&s;ire you to be&s;peak one of him for me.

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN your &s;ervant brought me your letter, I was ill in bed with a fever fit, which made it impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;it up, or to put my hands out of bed to write. It went off next day; but then I received the news of the death of an own Aunt (and of her Hu&s;band, who &s;urvived her but &s;ix days) at Geneva. Lord Luxborough &s;ent me word of it, becau&s;e my &s;urviving relations there did not well know where to direct to me: but I was equally obliged to write to them upon the occa&s;ion, and deferred writing to you merely upon that account; and at the &s;ame time re|&s;olved doing it by my &s;ervant Jo&s;eph, as to|morrow; but this day Mrs. Holyoak of Hen|ley
<PB N="384" REF="391">
has &s;ent to me to de&s;ire my chai&s;e may fetch her to &s;tay at Barrells &s;ome days; &s;o that my epi&s;tle cannot reach the Lea&s;owes be|fore Monday. This will, I hope, be a &s;uffi|cient excu&s;e for not an&s;wering yours &s;ooner; which I ought to have done, upon account of the Gentlewoman you recommend to me as an hou&s;ekeeper. Her character I would take from you, Sir, as &s;oon as from any friend or ac|quaintance living; but mu&s;t confe&s;s I have had &s;uch ill &s;ucce&s;s with &s;ervants in that po&s;t, that I intend to do without one; and have given the &s;ame an&s;wer to a friend of mine, who recommended one of Birmingham al&s;o.</P>
<P>I never was more &s;urprized nor concerned than at the death of Mi&s;s Dolman. I ever e&s;teemed her, and wi&s;hed her welfare. I con|dole with her Brother, as I do with you &s;in|cerely.</P>
<P>I rejoice that Fortune vi&s;its the Grange, and hope &s;he will call at the Lea&s;owes next. Poor Mr. Belchier is frowned upon by her; and though he is much obliged to Lord Dudley and you and my&s;elf, for our endeavours to &s;erve him, he thinks Lord Dudley's lawyer a little too &s;crupulous in his objections: for my part, I am no judge of that; but he &s;ays a few months would have been &s;ufficient to
<PB N="385" REF="392">
extricate him; and that the &s;ame favour is granted to other clergymen: and Sir Peter Soame writes him word he mu&s;t not let it be known where he is; for people are ready enough to enquire and to threaten to get writs out again&s;t him, which his friend Sir Peter Soame has hitherto prevented. In the mean time, the poor man is tormented with the ague, which Kent has given him, added to the vex|ation of his mind. If he dares get out, he will come with Sir Peter here, and thank me for my endeavours to &s;erve him.&mdash;You will I hope find out that he thinks there are many precedents for Gentlemen in orders receiving the favour he a&s;ks.&mdash;Sorry I am to be trouble&s;ome to my friends; but more &s;o, that I &s;ee the di&s;tre&s;s of others, without being capable of removing it, when they implore my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Talk to me no more, I de&s;ire, of your <HI>winterly &s;tate of health</HI>; for Boreas has at length given place to the Zephyrs, who will &s;hortly blow out the buds in my Shrubbery; which will take it ami&s;s if you &s;hould not be here to re|ceive its vernal offerings.</P>
<P>Mr. Hylton is very obliging in remembering me. I beg you will make him my compli|ments, and a&s;&s;ure him I would have an&s;wered
<PB N="386" REF="393">
his la&s;t, but imagined he would have quitted London for the Lea&s;owes long before now. His cabinets and boxes I e&s;teem as his har|bingers; and as for his wine, I hope at lea&s;t that you drank his health in it.</P>
<P>I am not &s;orry you have done nothing new of late at the Lea&s;owes: it wants nothing to make its beauties more admired; and your <HI>finances</HI> will be the better for your indolence in that point; as would mine, if I had been al|ways as indolent as I am at pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>YOUR thanking me for my vi&s;it at the Lea&s;owes, before I had &s;ent my thanks to you for your very kind and agreeable reception of me there, is very obliging; but being &s;o, it comes the &s;evere&s;t reproach you could have made me; by making me &s;en&s;ible of the rude|ne&s;s I have been guilty of, in not &s;ending to you &s;ince I left you. The truth is, that I had nobody to &s;end, having parted with the idle boy I had with me at your hou&s;e; and every day Jo&s;eph has been employed in driving me out: &s;o great a gadder has the fine weather made me, and &s;o much better health and &s;pirits has my journey to the Lea&s;owes given me. Ten phy&s;icians, with an equal number of &s;urgeons and apothecaries, could not have effected &s;uch an <HI>amendment</HI>; I believe I might &s;ay <HI>cure</HI>; for I have never been &s;ick once. I imagine your air is good; and I &s;ee that your improvements in your Walks and Ca&s;cades make your place a Paradi&s;e in miniature: yet, though I am its profe&s;&s;ed admirer, it mu&s;t permit me to &s;ay

that the conver&s;ation of the ma&s;ter and contri|ver of the <HI>beauties</HI> I &s;aw there, was to me pre|ferable far to them; &s;o that I regretted le&s;s than I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have done the weakne&s;s of my limbs, which prevented my <HI>trampouzing</HI> &s;o much as I u&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have been to &s;ee every neighbour I have, but the one I mo&s;t wi&s;h to &s;ee, Lady Ply|mouth.&mdash;A cro&s;s tenant of Mr. Sheldon's has cut off all connection between Hewell and Barrells; yet I per&s;evere in trying for a road, as eagerly as tho&s;e who bore for a mine.

It is the lea&s;t &s;ize I have, but mu&s;t be cut le&s;s. I took it from Queen Caro|line (for robbing crowned heads is no more than a fair repri&s;al). My other frames of that &s;ize were not gilt, but lacquered, which I thought not good enough, though Mr. Thomas would have taken one, as it was out of u&s;e; but I judged it to be le&s;s genteel than that which I &s;end, and I remembered this &s;uited to the frame over your parlour-chimney, which

Now in ca&s;e Mr. Hylton is not already pro|vided, why &s;hould he not come in the Bir|mingham coach to Henley? when here, he may &s;ee this mare, and may hear of others; and if he &s;hould not purcha&s;e, the coach will be a certain vehicle at his return. This propo&s;al puts a &s;top to your future delays,
<PB N="407" REF="414">
upon his account, and &s;hows my <HI>empre&s;&s;ement</HI> to &s;ee you both.</P>
<P>I have no time to write more; for Mrs. <HI>Maydew</HI> mu&s;t have my letter to-night, and will carry it &s;afe to-morrow early to the po&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Outing is at Oldbarrow: I am alone and &s;tupid; &s;o adieu.&mdash;Believe me unalterably</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours, &amp;c. H. LUXBOROUGH.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>The coach &s;ets out from Henley, I think, Mondays and Thur&s;days, and is at Henley by breakfa&s;t (eight or nine). Mr. Hylton might lie over night at Birmingham.</P>
<P>This letter is &s;horter than ordinary, and perhaps you will complain; I will therefore &s;ubjoin a trifling <HI>impromptu</HI> I once wrote in a hurry, and which I am doubtful if I ever &s;hewed you; but think I never &s;hewed any body. It will &s;erve to read, and then kindle your candle, or <HI>&s;often your flute</HI>, if you u&s;e paper, as u&s;ual, on that occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>THIS goes not only to make you the compliments of the &s;ea&s;on, (which I do very &s;incerely, and not merely becau&s;e it is cu&s;tomary) but it al&s;o goes to a&s;k how you do, and what can occa&s;ion your &s;ilence? It is an age &s;ince I wrote to you about a hor&s;e Mi&s;s Molly Holyoake has to &s;ell, which I thought might &s;uit Mr. Hylton; and propo&s;ed, that if he was not already provided with one, he might come to Barrells in the Birmingham coach when you &s;hould come here: and in that letter I inclo&s;ed a few bad Lines of my own, wrote &s;ome years ago: &s;ince all which, I received the inclo&s;ed from our trouble&s;ome little Par&s;on, who is, thank God, &s;ailing towards America. I &s;end it, becau&s;e Lord Dudley's protection is in it; which I de&s;ire you will take out and deliver to his Lord&s;hip from me, with many thanks and many excu&s;es for having troubled him about this affair.&mdash;I inclo&s;e, be|&s;ides the other, a letter I received from Sir William Meredith, as you are mentioned in it.&mdash; Mr. Outing is gone to &s;up at Henley, and does not know of my writing, or you would have compliments from him.</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="416">I have not &s;een the new Tragedy <HI>Barbaro&s;&s;a:</HI> perhaps you can lend it me.&mdash;Mr. Outing has talked &s;everal times of making a vi&s;it at the Grange; but does not know whether Lord Dudley is there, or at the Parliament.</P>

<P>YOUR &s;ilence excites me to break mine; for upon the pre&s;ent footing one of us might be murdered (like the Dey of Algiers), and the other die of an apoplexy, and the longe&s;t liver of the two know nothing of the fate of the other.

It is true I did not an&s;wer your la&s;t; but Mr. Outing wrote you the rea&s;on, which ought to have been excu&s;e &s;ufficient; for I was really ill, and in|capable of guiding a pen. I am much better: but as the Warwick&s;hire roads do not invite one abroad at this &s;ea&s;on, one doubly wi&s;hes for the company of one's friends round our de&s;erted hearths.</P>

<P>I CANNOT well conde&s;cend to thank you for your letter of the 17th, con&s;idering that it was &s;carcely the &s;hadow of what I long expected, which was your company and Mr. Hylton's in my Shrubbery, my Hermitage, my Library, and, in the evenings, at my fire|&s;ide. No le&s;s than three weeks are pa&s;t &s;ince the la&s;t promi&s;e came, the others having been

buried in oblivion: but of this la&s;t I held my|&s;elf &s;o &s;ure, that, being obliged to go on Wedne&s;day la&s;t to Warwick, I left my butler at home with orders to fetch Mrs. Holyoake to entertain you till my return; but behold! you do not &s;o much as make mention of your having had thoughts, much le&s;s of having given promi&s;es to vi&s;it this place and me! The elms are green in vain: in vain the cu|cumbers are large, and as vainly the Shrubbery &s;hoots out, and the Coppice has a carpet of primro&s;es, cow&s;lips, &amp;c. Let them reproach you; and let your Governe&s;s, Mrs. Holyoake, correct you: and may &s;he boa&s;t

<P>The prettie&s;t thing I ever &s;aw of the kind, is the &s;hell-room at Guy's Clift: Mr. Greet|head and Lady Mary have executed it all with their own hands: <HI>bed-hangings, chimney-boards, pictures</HI> over the doors, &amp;c. If you was not lazy, you would &s;ee it. I came from it through Warwick, Snitterfield, Bu&s;hes, Bearly, and Wooton; but on hor&s;eback you would not have had that trouble.</P>
<P>Mr. Nugent vi&s;its me again. Mr. Soame is under inoculation, very full, and in good &s;pirits.&mdash;I go to-morrow to Kinwarton to dine with a clergyman, who &s;eems to have &s;ome

<P>LADY Luxborough &s;ends her compliments to Mr. Shen&s;tone, and if it is agreeable to him in all re&s;pects, &s;he would go on Saturday morning to the Lea&s;owes, to lie one night only.&mdash;Sir Peter Soame and his Son are at Bar|rells, and are very de&s;irous of waiting on Mr. Shen&s;tone. Mr. Outing and Mrs. Davies are al&s;o at Barrells, and would accompany her, if not trouble&s;ome.

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the favour of yours by your &s;ervant; and as you &s;ay you have had intelligence, the moment you wrote, of the melancholy news from
<PB N="415" REF="422" MS="Y">
Barrells, give me leave to a&s;&s;ure you I expected Mrs. Davies or Mr. Outing would have ac|quainted you with it as &s;oon as the poor Lady's breath was gone, as they did the &s;ame to Sir Peter Soame, Sir William Meredith, and &s;ome others of my Lady's relations. I depended upon this, as my Wife mentioned it to them before me; which if I had imagined they had ne|glected, I would certainly have wrote to you my&s;elf.&mdash;We have been, and indeed &s;till are, in hurry and confu&s;ion, though at the &s;ame time it gives me great &s;atisfaction to &s;ay truly, that nothing hath been wanting, either to pro|long her life, or to prepare her for the other world, as far as opportunities and intervals would give leave. The beginning of her illne&s;s was occa&s;ioned by a cold and hoar&s;ene&s;s, about a month &s;ince, in &s;etting out for Wootton about five o'clock on Friday: the Sunday following &s;he &s;ent for my Wife and Daughter to drink tea, and a me&s;&s;age to me, that &s;he expected I would call as I returned from Ullenhall Chapel; which accordingly I did, and ob&s;erved the above-mentioned &s;ymptoms upon her, and told her, that as I had the care of Ullenhall, &s;he would give me leave to &s;ay to her, as I thought it incumbent to do, that as &s;he had not attend|ed Church nor the Sacrament very lately, I would advi&s;e her to receive the Sacrament. She
<PB N="416" REF="423" MS="Y">
an&s;wered, I was very good, and that &s;he would &s;end to me very &s;oon; and accordingly received it with great devotion. The night before &s;he died I read the Recommendatory Prayer to her; and I hope &s;he is perfectly happy, though &s;he had &s;o great troubles and afflictions in this life. &mdash;My Wife would gladly have wrote to you; but the truth of it is, &s;he returned from Barrells but ye&s;terday, and is very ill; and for this rea|&s;on, &s;he hopes you will not take it unkind.&mdash; Mrs. Davies and Outing have been with Lady Luxborough all her illne&s;s, which I am very glad of.&mdash;Lord Luxborough is expected at Barrells to-morrow, to give orders about the funeral.&mdash;I have nothing more material to add, but my Wife and Daughter's be&s;t compliments, and to a&s;k your pardon for this incoherent letter from, Dear Sir,</P>
