FOR THE CONDUCT OF
FEMALE EDUCATION.</HEAD>

<HEAD>Section I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE FEMALE CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE PARENTS and guardians of young ladies of the la&s;t
half century were le&s;s &s;olicitous about procuring for them &s;o
exten&s;ive an education, as modern refinement requires. Hence
it happens, that female education has not yet been reduced to a
perfect: &s;y&s;tem; but is frequently directed by tho&s;e, who have
not them&s;elves had a good education, or who have not &s;tudied
the &s;ubject with &s;ufficient attention. And tho' many ingenious
remarks are to be found in the works of Locke, Rou&s;&s;eau,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Genlis, and other writers &s;till more modern; yet few of them
are exactly applicable to the management of boarding &s;chools;
the improvement of which is the intent of the pre&s;ent treati&s;e.</P>
<P>The advantages of a good education con&s;i&s;t in uniting health
and agility of body with chearfulne&s;s and activity of mind; in
&s;uperadding graceful movements to the former, and agreeable
ta&s;tes to the latter; and in the acquirement of the rudiments of
&s;uch arts and &s;ciences, as may amu&s;e our&s;elves, or gain us the
e&s;teem of others; with a &s;trict attention to the culture of morality
and religion.</P>
<P>The female character &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the mild and retiring vir|tues
rather than the bold and dazzling ones; great eminence in
almo&s;t any thing is &s;ometimes injurious to a young lady; who&s;e
temper and di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould appear to be pliant rather than ro|bu&s;t;
to be ready to take impre&s;&s;ions rather than to be decidedly
mark'd; as great apparent &s;trength of character, however excel|lent,
is liable to alarm both her own and the other &s;ex; and to
create admiration rather than affection.</P>
<P>There are however &s;ituations in &s;ingle life; in which, after
the completion of their &s;chool-education, ladies may cultivate to
<PB N="11" REF="10">
any extent the fine arts or the &s;ciences for their amu&s;ement or
in&s;truction. And there are &s;ituations in a married &s;tate; which
may call forth all the energies of the mind in the care, education,
or provi&s;ion, for a family; which the inactivity, folly, or death
of a hu&s;band may render nece&s;&s;ary. Hence if to &s;oftne&s;s of man|ners,
complacency of countenance, gentle unhurried motion,
with a voice clear and yet tender, the charms which enchant all
hearts! can be &s;uperadded internal &s;trength and activity of mind,
capable to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s or combat the evils of life; with
a due &s;en&s;e of moral and religious obligation; all is obtain'd,
which education can &s;upply; the female character becomes com|pleat,
excites our love, and commands our admiration.</P>
<P>Education &s;hould draw the outline, and teach the u&s;e of the
pencil; but the exertions of the individual mu&s;t afterwards intro|duce
the various gradations of &s;hade and colour, mu&s;t illuminate
the land&s;cape, and fill it with the beautiful figures of the Graces
and the Virtues.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<PB N="12" REF="11">
<HEAD>Section II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MUSICK AND DANCING</HEAD>
<P>ARE generally taught by ma&s;ters, who profe&s;s tho&s;e arts;
concerning which we &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that they are frequently
believed to be of too great importance in female education; and
on that account that too much time is expended on their acquire|ment.
It is perhaps more de&s;irable, that young ladies &s;hould play,
&s;ing, and dance, only &s;o well as to amu&s;e them&s;elves and their
friends, than to practi&s;e tho&s;e arts in &s;o eminent a degree as to
astoni&s;h the public; becau&s;e a great apparent attention to trivial
accompli&s;hments is liable to give a &s;u&s;picion, that more valuable
acqui&s;itions have been neglected. And, as they con&s;i&s;t in an
exhibition of the per&s;on, they are liable to be attended with vani|ty,
and to extingui&s;h the blu&s;h of youthful timidity; which is
in young ladies the mo&s;t powerful of their exterior charms.</P>
<P>Such ma&s;ters &s;hould be cho&s;en to in&s;truct young ladies in the&s;e
accompli&s;hments, as are not only well qualified to &s;ing and play,
<PB N="13" REF="12">
or to dance them&s;elves; but al&s;o who can teach with good temper
and genteel behaviour: they &s;hould recollect, that vulgar man|ners,
with the &s;harp ge&s;tures of anger, and its di&s;agreeable tones
of voice, are unpardonable in tho&s;e, who profe&s;s to teach grace|ful
motion, and melodious expre&s;&s;ion; and may affect the ta&s;te
and temper of their pupils, &s;o as to be more injurious to their
education; than any thing, which they are able to teach them,
can counterbalance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">READING.</HEAD>
<P>AS Reading is as much a language to the eye, as &s;peaking is
to the ear; it requires much time and labour for children to ac|quire
both the&s;e languages. Such books &s;hould therefore be put
into their hands, as join amu&s;ement with in&s;truction, and thus
lighten the fatigue of continued application, as Sandford and
Merton, Parent's a&s;&s;i&s;tant, Evenings at home, and many others.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13">
In learning to read aloud, a clear and di&s;tinct enunciation is
&s;eldom acquired at &s;chools; which is owing to the child &s;tanding
clo&s;e to the teacher, who looks over the book along with it; and
hence the pupil finds no difficulty in being under&s;tood, even
when &s;he pronounces only half words. This however is ea&s;ily
remedied by placing the reader at the di&s;tance of two yards or
more from the hearer; then the young &s;cholar &s;oon finds, that
&s;he is not under&s;tood, unle&s;s &s;he expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf with clear
articulation. For this purpo&s;e the teacher &s;hould always be pro|vided
with a duplicate of the book, &s;he teaches; that &s;he may
not be nece&s;&s;itated to look over the &s;houlder of her pupil.</P>
<P>As the young &s;cholars advance in the knowledge of language,
other books mu&s;t be taught them both in pro&s;e and poetry; &s;uch
as may improve their minds in the knowledge of things, in mo|rality,
religion, or which may form their ta&s;te. A great number
of books for the u&s;e of children has been publi&s;hed in late years;
many of them by very ingenious writers, and well adapted to the
purpo&s;e de&s;igned, of &s;uch of the&s;e, as have come to my know|ledge,
a catalogue &s;hall be given at the end of this treati&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="section">
<PB N="15" REF="14">
<HEAD>Section IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WRITING.</HEAD>
<P>WRITING, as it keeps the body in a fix'd po&s;ture, as well
as drawing, and needlework, &s;hould not be too long applied to
at a time; &s;ince the body, and even the countenance, may thus
get a certain tendency to one attitude; as is &s;een in children, who
are brought up to &s;ome mechanic art, as in poli&s;hing buttons or
precious &s;tones on a lathe. A proper manner of holding the pen,
or pencil, or needle, with an ea&s;y but graceful attitude of the
per&s;on, and an agreeable moderate attention of the countenance,
&s;hould fir&s;t be taught; for which purpo&s;es an inclined de&s;k has
many advantages over an horizontal table for the books, or work|ing
frames; as the body is thence le&s;s bent forwards; and the
light in general &s;ituations more vividly reflected to the eye.</P>
<P>If the de&s;k be &s;ixteen inches broad, the furthermo&s;t edge of it
&s;hould ri&s;e about three inches and half from the horizontal line;
<PB N="16" REF="15">
which produces the mo&s;t convenient inclination, and the table or
frame, which &s;upports it, for the u&s;e of the taller children, &s;hould
ri&s;e about two feet eight inches from the ground.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GRAMMAR,</HEAD>
<P>WHICH is an ab&s;tract &s;cience teaching the texture of lan|guage,
is too hard for very young minds; and is therefore gene|rally
taught too early: and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of Arithmetic.
The Engli&s;h grammars in general u&s;e at &s;chools are both tedious
and defective compo&s;itions; an epitome, or extract, from Lowth's
grammar, with the late improvements of Mr. Horne Tooke in
the theory of language, would well &s;upply this branch of know|ledge;
and might be given to the public under the name of a
&startq;rational Engli&s;h grammar.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Devis has publi&s;h'd a &s;mall and u&s;eful rudiment of gram|mar
purpo&s;ely for the u&s;e of young Iadies; which may be taught
as an introduction to Lowth's grammar. The Abb&eacute; Gaultier's
<PB N="17" REF="16">
Jeu de Grammaire may perhaps be render'd amu&s;ing to children,
and convey to them ideas of the French grammar. It is &s;old by
Elm&s;ley in the Strand, and by Mrs. Harrow in Pall-Mall; but
is perhaps better adapted to private families, than to &s;chools.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">LANGUAGES.</HEAD>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of learning &s;ome antient or foreign languages
impo&s;es a laborious ta&s;k on the youth of both &s;exes; which con|&s;umes
years of their precious time, which might otherwi&s;e be
employed in the acqui&s;ition of &s;ciences. The difficulty of ob|taining
a competent knowledge of the Greek or Latin language
is many times greater than that of obtaining any modern one; as
may be deduced from the innumerable changes of the termination
of their nouns, adjectives, and verbs; which to a beginner are
all &s;o many new words. And as the works of the be&s;t writers
in the&s;e languages have been tran&s;lated into our own, it is le&s;s
nece&s;&s;ary in the education of ladies to expend &s;o much time and
labour in acquiring them. But as the French and Italian are le&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="17">
difficult to learn, and contain new books of ta&s;te and knowledge,
which are yearly publi&s;h'd in this age of literature; and as they
are convenient for conver&s;ing with foreigners, who come hither,
or in our travelling into other countries; and la&s;tly, as they are
agreeable as well as fa&s;hionable &s;tudies; the pupils of boarding
&s;chools &s;hould be encouraged to attain one or both of them.</P>
<P>The method recommended by Mr. Locke in his treati&s;e on
education, &s;ect. 162, of teaching languages by conver&s;ation, will
on trial be generally found &s;ucce&s;sful in re&s;pect to modern lan|guages
with even the younge&s;t children. Neverthele&s;s a know|ledge
of grammar &s;hould afterwards be taught with care, if the
child be too young at fir&s;t to attend to it; for without the aid of
grammar not only the French or Italian languages, but even the
Engli&s;h will not always be &s;poken or written with perfect
accuracy.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e of acquiring modern languages by conver&s;a|tion,
a &s;chool generally &s;upplies better opportunities than a pri|vate
family, be&s;ides the advantage of &s;ome degree of emulation,
which frequently exi&s;ts, where children conver&s;e together: ano|ther
advantage of infantine &s;ociety is, that they learn many other
things, as well as languages, by repeating them to each other; and
<PB N="19" REF="18">
obtain, what is &s;eldom to be acquired from adult companions,
&s;ome knowledge of phy&s;iognomy; as the pa&s;&s;ions of children are
more legibly expre&s;s'd on their countenances than at a maturer
age. This knowledge of phy&s;iognomy, which is perhaps only
to be acquired at &s;chools, by giving a promptitude of under&s;tand|ing
the pre&s;ent approbation or di&s;like, and the good or bad de|&s;igns,
of tho&s;e whom we conver&s;e with, becomes of hourly u&s;e
in almo&s;t every department of life.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">ARITHMETIC</HEAD>
<P>LIKE grammar is an ab&s;tract &s;cience, which is frequently
attempted to be taught too early; at the &s;ame time it may be
ob&s;erved, that the early initiation of mo&s;t children into card play|ing
before they come to &s;chool, by giving clear and vi&s;ible ideas
of the ten fir&s;t numerals, &s;eems greatly to facilitate their acquire|ment
of arithmetic; and if this fa&s;hionable amu&s;ement could be
&s;o managed by the parents, who allow it to their children, as not
to excite a de&s;ire of gain along with a conte&s;t of ingenuity, it
<PB N="20" REF="19">
might be rendered, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, advantageous by exciting the
mind to activity in this branch of &s;cience; but is neverthele&s;s
not proper to be u&s;ed in &s;chools, where it's effects on the pa&s;&s;ions
cannot be &s;ufficiently watched, and counteracted.</P>
<P>So much of the &s;cience of numbers as is in common u&s;e, as
the numeration, &s;ubtraction, multiplication, and divi&s;ion of mo|ney,
&s;hould be learnt with accuracy; to which &s;hould be added
the rule of three, and decimal fractions; which will abundantly
repay the labour of acquiring them by the plea&s;ure and utility,
which will perpetually re&s;ult from the knowledge of them thro'
life. The higher parts of arithmetic, as algebra and fluxions, be|long
to the ab&s;tru&s;er &s;ciences.</P>
<P>There are many introductory books to the &s;cience of arith|metic;
tho&s;e I have heard mo&s;t recommended are Vi&s;e's tutor's
guide, Hutton's practical arithmetic, and Wingate's arithmetic;
but it is probable, that mo&s;t of the introductory treati&s;es to arith|metic
mu&s;t be nearly of equal excellence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="section">
<PB N="21" REF="20">
<HEAD>Section VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GEOGRAPHY.</HEAD>
<P>SO much of this &s;cience, as depends only on memory, may be
taught to children in their early years. They &s;hould be taught
to point out on large maps the counties of England, and then the
principal divi&s;ions of Europe, and of the other quarters of the
world; and la&s;tly to trace out the principal rivers and mountains,
which ingrave or imbo&s;s it's &s;urface, which is much to be pre|fer'd
to di&s;&s;ected maps; as it is the &s;ituations, rather than the
exact forms of counties and of countries, which &s;hould be at|tended
to. Afterwards the u&s;e of the globes &s;hould be explain'd;
and &s;ome &s;hort outline of a&s;tronomy ought to accompany the&s;e
lectures.</P>
<P>A compendious &s;y&s;tem of geography on cards, publi&s;hed by
Mr. Newberry, in St. Paul's church yard, &s;upplies a very conve|nient
method of in&s;tructing children. Other geographical cards
by Bowles, tho' they only mention the latitude and longitude of
<PB N="22" REF="21">
important places, may al&s;o be u&s;ed with advantage. The maps
publi&s;h'd by Mr. Faden, which have blank outlines to be filled up
by the &s;tudent, are well de&s;igned, and not very expen&s;ive. The
Abb&eacute; Gualtier's cours de Geographie form'd into a game may,
like his game at grammar, be render'd amu&s;ing to children, and
are tolerably well adapted both to private families, where there
are but few pupils, and to public &s;eminaries of in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Fairman's geography, a &s;mall octavo &s;old by John&s;on, contains
a &s;hort account of the planets, and u&s;e of the globes. Brooks's
gazetteer is an u&s;eful work; and &s;ome other good geographical
publications are mentioned in the catalogue of books at the end
of this work.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of mankind is connected with the knowledge of
the earth, which they cultivate. A &s;ummary of the hi&s;tory of
England &s;hould precede that of other nations, as it may be more
<PB N="23" REF="22">
intere&s;ting, and more ea&s;ily comprehended by Engli&s;h children.
Afterwards an abridgement of the hi&s;tory of other nations both
antient and modern may be collected from various writers, but
are &s;ome of them already made conci&s;e and agreeable by Dr. Gold|&s;mith
in his hi&s;tories of Greece and Rome, as well as of England
and Scotland; which however cannot be well remembered with|out
a previous knowledge of geography, or by con&s;ulting maps
with every change of place in the account of tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>Afterwards a brief, but correct knowledge of hi&s;tory &s;till more
ancient, and of chronology, comprehending the four great em|pires
of the world, with the ri&s;e of the pre&s;ent kingdoms of
Europe from the fall of the la&s;t, may be acquired according to
the plan of Mrs. Chapone in her letters on the improvement of
the mind. This outline of hi&s;tory and chronology may be readily
and agreeably learned from Prie&s;tley's chart of hi&s;tory; which
with his chart of biography &s;hould hang among&s;t a collection
of large well-colour'd maps in the parlour of a boarding &s;chool,
that they may frequently encounter the eyes of the young
&s;tudents.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="section">
<PB N="24" REF="23">
<HEAD>Section X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">NATURAL HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of the various other animals is al&s;o connected
with our knowledge of the various parts of the earth, which they
inhabit. This is termed natural hi&s;tory, and may be taught to
children earlier than the hi&s;tories of mankind, as being ea&s;ier to
their comprehen&s;ions, and thence more intere&s;ting and agreeable
to them. Dr. Gold&s;mith in his hi&s;tory of animated nature has
al&s;o made this part of knowledge of easy acce&s;s; and Mr.
Bewick's account of quadrupedes, with wood-prints of the ani|mals,
and amu&s;ing tale-pieces to the &s;ections, are quite charming
to children. To the&s;e &s;hould be added a treati&s;e on birds, with
the &s;cientific names admirably adapted for the u&s;e of &s;chools by
Mr. Galton, publi&s;h'd by John&s;on in St. Paul's church yard,
London, in three &s;mall volumes. And be&s;ides the&s;e, children
&s;hould be permitted occa&s;ionally to in&s;pect the collections of fo|reign
animals, which are frequently exhibited in this country;
<PB N="25" REF="24">
as an examination of the objects them&s;elves conveys clearer ideas
than prints and de&s;criptions, and at the &s;ame time adds to their
knowledge, and gratifies their curio&s;ity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE RUDIMENTS OF TASTE</HEAD>
<P>ARE too much neglected in mo&s;t boarding &s;chools; the&s;e
&s;hould be taught with &s;ome care, as perhaps peculiarly belonging
to Ladies; &s;ince ta&s;te enters into their dre&s;s, their motions, their
manners, as well as into all the fine arts, which they have lei&s;ure
to cultivate; as drawing, painting, modelling, making artificial
flowers, embroidery; writing letters, reading, &s;peaking, and into
almo&s;t every circum&s;tance of life.</P>
<P>The general rudiments of ta&s;te are to be acquired fir&s;t by
reading books, which treat profe&s;&s;edly on the &s;ubject; as the ten
papers by Mr. Addi&s;on on the power of imagination in the Spec|tator,
vol. 6, No. 411; Akin&s;ide's plea&s;ures of imagination;
Burke on the &s;ublime and beautiful; Hogarth's analy&s;is of beauty;
<PB N="26" REF="25">
Ma&s;on's Engli&s;h garden; Wheatley's ornamental gardening; and
Gilpin's picture&s;que views. Secondly by &s;electing and explain|ing
admired pa&s;&s;ages from cla&s;&s;ical authors, as the Beauties of
Shake&s;pear, of John&s;on, and of Stern. And la&s;tly by exhibiting
and explaining the prints of beautiful objects, or ca&s;ts of the be&s;t
antique gems and medallions.</P>
<P>The authors above mentioned have divided the objects of Ta&s;te
into the &s;ublime, the beautiful, and the new; but a new &s;ect of
inquirers into this &s;ubject have lately added the Picture&s;que;
which is &s;uppo&s;ed to differ from the beautiful by it's want of
&s;moothne&s;s, and from the &s;ublime from it's want of &s;ize; but
this circum&s;tance has not yet perhaps undergone &s;ufficient exa|mination.
&mdash;See e&s;&s;ay on Picture&s;que, by U. Price.</P>
<P>Others have endeavoured to make a di&s;tinction between beauty
and grace; and have e&s;teem'd them, as it were, rivals for the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the human heart. But Grace may be defined Beauty
in action; for a &s;leeping beauty can not be called graceful, in
whatever attitude &s;he may recline; the mu&s;cles mu&s;t be in action
to produce a graceful attitude, and the limbs to produce a grace|ful
motion. The &s;uppo&s;ed origin of our ideas of beauty acquired
in our early infancy from the curved lines, which form the female

<HEAD TYPE="sub">DRAWING AND EMBROIDERY.</HEAD>
<P>DRAWING as an elegant art belongs to the education of
young ladies, and greatly facilitates the acquirement of Ta&s;te.
As this is generally taught by ma&s;ters, who profe&s;s it, I &s;hall
only ob&s;erve, that tho' as an art it con&s;i&s;ts of deceiving the eye,
yet as a &s;cience it is capable of producing to the mind the mo&s;t
&s;ublime and beautiful images, or the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;cenes of
life, for our amu&s;ement, admiration, or in&s;truction.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation applies to Embroidery, which is paint|ing
with the needle in&s;tead of the pencil, and &s;eems to have been
a fa&s;hionable employment of ladies of the highe&s;t rank in the early
ages of the world. As the ladies in polite life have frequently
much lei&s;ure time at their di&s;po&s;al, it is wi&s;e for them to learn
many elegant as well as u&s;eful arts in their early years; which
<PB N="28" REF="27">
they may afterward cultivate for their amu&s;ement; and thus de|prive
&s;olitude of irk&s;omene&s;s: And by being able to entertain
them&s;elves, they may be le&s;s &s;olicitous to enter the circles of di&s;|&s;ipation,
and depend le&s;s for happine&s;s on the caprice of others.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the amu&s;ement or accompli&s;hment of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the
talent of drawing, there is another advantage re&s;ulting from it;
which con&s;i&s;ts in u&s;ing the pencil as a language to expre&s;s the
forms of all vi&s;ible objects, as of flowers, machines, hou&s;es,
land&s;capes; which can not in words alone be conveyed to others
with &s;ufficient accuracy: For this end it may be &s;ufficient to
draw in outlines alone the figures of natural things, without ex|pending
&s;o much time on this art, as is requi&s;ite to enable the
learner to add the nice touches, which form the delicate grada|tions
of &s;hade and colour.</P>
<P>It may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;ome knowledge of the &s;cience of
per&s;pective &s;hould be previou&s;ly acquired for the purpo&s;e of draw|ing
the outlines of objects; but I &s;u&s;pect, that this is not always
nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince at our learning to &s;ee; before we have compared
the ideas received by the &s;en&s;e of &s;ight with tho&s;e received by
that of touch; any object placed before our eyes, as &s;uppo&s;e the
face of a companion, mu&s;t appear a flat coloured or &s;haded &s;ur|face,
<PB N="29" REF="28">
and not a &s;olid &s;ubstance cover'd with eminences and depre&s;|&s;ions;
as is &s;o well proved by Bi&s;hop Berkley in his theory of
vision. Hence if any one could &s;o far unlearn the language of
&s;ight as to imagine the face of his companion to be a flat colour'd
&s;urface only, (as it is really &s;een) he would draw from nature as
ea&s;ily and exactly, as if he was copying a picture, as the inequa|lities
would appear lights and &s;hades; and he would thus be
enabled to take the likene&s;s with much greater facility and accu|racy without the aid of the rules of per&s;pective.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY</HEAD>
<P>IS connected with the &s;tudy of ta&s;te, and &s;hould therefore be
taught in boarding &s;chools; as without &s;ome knowledge of it the
works of the painters, &s;tatuari&s;ts, and poets, both antient and
modern, can not be under&s;tood. But as a great part of this
mythology con&s;i&s;ts of per&s;onify'd vices, much care &s;hould be
taken in female &s;chools, as well as in male ones, to prevent any
bad impre&s;&s;ions, which might be made on the mind by this kind
<PB N="30" REF="29">
of erudition; this is to be accompli&s;hed by explaining the alle|gorical
meaning of many of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed actions of heathen
deities, and by &s;hewing that they are at pre&s;ent u&s;ed only as
emblems of certain powers, as Minerva of wi&s;dom, and Bellona
of war, and thus con&s;titute the language of painters; and are
indeed almo&s;t the whole language which that art po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, be&s;ides
the delineation of vi&s;ible objects in re&s;t or in action.</P>
<P>These emblems however are not to be &s;o easily acquired by
de&s;criptions alone, nor &s;o ea&s;ily remembered by young pupils; as
when prints of antique &s;tatues, or medallions, or when cameos,
or impre&s;&s;ions of antique gems, are at the &s;ame time &s;hewn and
explained to them. For this purpo&s;e the prints of Spence's
Polymetis may be exhibited and explained; from which Bell's
pantheon is principally taken: And Dannet's dictionary of my|thology,
originally written in french, may be occa&s;ionally con|&s;ulted;
and the notes on Mr. Pope's tran&s;lations of Homer.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a little book intitled, &startq;In&s;tructions &s;ur les Meta|morpho&s;es,
par M. Le Ragois,&endq; which, I am informed is an u&s;e|ful
and unexceptionable work for this purpo&s;e, containing a kind
of &s;ummary of each &s;tory of fabulous mythology: to which may
be added a tran&s;lation of Ovid's Metamorpho&s;es, publi&s;hed by
<PB N="31" REF="30">
Garth; which, I am told, is the be&s;t tran&s;lation of that work.
Much agreeable knowledge of this kind is to be found in Byrant's
mythology; Abbe de Pluche's hi&s;tory of the heavens; Warbur|ton's
e&s;&s;ay on Elen&s;inian my&s;teries; to which I beg leave to add
the de&s;cri&s;ption of the Portland va&s;e in the notes to the fir&s;t vo|lume

<HEAD TYPE="sub">POLITE LITERATURE</HEAD>
<P>MAY be divided into di&s;&s;ertations, plays, romances, poems;
each of which, if the works are properly &s;elected, may afford
amu&s;ement and in&s;truction to young per&s;ons; of &s;ome of the
books of each of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of literature a catalogue will be
given at the end of the work.</P>
<P>Such di&s;&s;ertations, as have been generally admired, may be
&s;elected from the Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, the World, the
Rambler, Adventurer, be&s;ides many others.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="31">
Plays are of three kinds, tragical, &s;entimental, and humour|ous;
of the fir&s;t, Addi&s;on's Cato has been long admired; and the
tragedies of Thomp&s;on con&s;i&s;t of fine language. Of the &s;econd
kind Cumberland's comedies are in&s;tances; and of the third She|ridan's
comedies; &s;ome of which are entertaining and inoffen&s;ive,
and may be read by young ladies without injury to their morals,
or much outrage to their feelings.</P>
<P>There are many plays, which are better &s;een as exhibited on
the &s;tage, than as read in the clo&s;et; becau&s;e the objectionable
pa&s;&s;ages are generally omitted in the repre&s;entation. But whether
young ladies &s;hould be taught to act plays them&s;elves, as is done
at &s;ome boy's &s;chools, is a matter of doubt. The danger con&s;i&s;ts
in this, lea&s;t the acqui&s;ition of bolder action, and a more elevated
voice, &s;hould annihilate that retiring mode&s;ty, and blu&s;hing em|barra&s;ment,
to which young ladies owe one of their mo&s;t power|ful
external charms.</P>
<P>If young ladies act plays among&s;t them&s;elves only, or without
admitting more than two or three of their friends or parents; or
if they repeat cho&s;en &s;cenes of plays, or &s;peeches only, much of
the above objection cea&s;es, and &s;ome advantages may re&s;ult to
their attitudes or enunciation. Madam de Genlis's Theatre
<PB N="33" REF="32">
D'Education affords the lea&s;t exceptionable whole plays, with the
&s;acred dramas of Mi&s;s Moore, and of Meta&s;tatio.</P>
<P>3. Novels or romances may be divided into the &s;erious, the
humorous, and the amorous. Of the&s;e, the u&s;e of the la&s;t &s;hould
be intirely interdicted; but the fir&s;t, when well managed, may
convey in&s;truction in the mo&s;t agreeable and forceable manner:
Such as Mr. Day's Sandford and Merton. The Children's friend.
Tales of the ca&s;tle. Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe. Edward, by the author
of Zelucco. And to the&s;e may be added &s;ome other modern
novels, the productions of ingenious ladies, which are I believe
le&s;s objectionable than many others; as the Evelina, Cecilia, and
Camilla of Mi&s;s Burney. The Emmeline and Ethelinda of
Charlotte Smith; Inchbald's &s;imple &s;tory; Mrs. Brook's Emely
Montague; and the female Quixote; all which I have here
introduced from the character given to me of them by a very
ingenious lady, not having my&s;elf read them with &s;ufficient
attention. And la&s;tly, the humorous novels, which are not writ|ten
to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions, convey in&s;truction, as far as they are
imitations of real life: Of the&s;e are Le Sage's famous novel of
Gil Blas; and Fielding's Tom Jones; neither of which however
are proper books for young readers.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">
There are many, who condemn the u&s;e of novels altogether;
but what are epic poems but novels in ver&s;e?&mdash;It is difficult to
draw the line of limit between novels, and other works of ima|gination;
unle&s;s the word novel be confined to mean only the
romances of love and chivalry.</P>
<P>It is true indeed, that almo&s;t all novels, as well as plays, and
epic poems, have &s;ome exceptional pa&s;&s;ages to be found in them;
which might therefore be expunged, before they are allow'd to
be read by young ladies. But are young women therefore to be
kept in intire ignorance of mankind, with whom they mu&s;t
&s;hortly a&s;&s;ociate, and from whom they are frequently to chu&s;e a
partner for life? This would be making them the &s;laves rather
than the companions of men, like the Sultanas of a Turki&s;h
Seraglio. And how can young women, who are &s;ecluded from
the other &s;ex from their infancy, form any judgment of men, if
they are not to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;uch books, as delineate manners?
&mdash;A lady of fortune, who was per&s;uaded by her guardian to marry
a di&s;agreeable and &s;elfi&s;h man, &s;peaking to her friend of the ill
humour of her hu&s;band, lamented, that &s;he had been prohibited
from reading novels. &startq;If I had read &s;uch books, &s;aid &s;he, before
I was married, I &s;hould have cho&s;en better; I was told, that
all men were alike except in re&s;pect to fortune.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34">
We mu&s;t however ob&s;erve, that novels are perhaps more ob|jectionable
in &s;chools than in private education; as the comments
of one bad mind may be dangerous to the whole community:
And as they are more amu&s;ing to young people than any other
books, if read too early, they may give a di&s;tate to more u&s;eful
knowledge; which are good rea&s;ons for the total prohibition of
them in &s;chools: And in private education, lea&s;t a preference of
fiction to truth &s;hould be thus instill'd, the ridiculous pa&s;&s;ages,
with which even the be&s;t novels abound, &s;hould be carefully
pointed out by a friend or governe&s;s; with their exaggerations,
improbabilities, and frequent deviations from nature.</P>
<P>There are indeed few books, which delineate manners, whe|ther
in pro&s;e or poetry, however well cho&s;en, which have not
&s;ome objectionable pa&s;&s;ages in them. In reading the fables of
E&s;op, Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau well ob&s;erves, that the effect on the mind
may frequently be totally different from that de&s;igned by the
author; as in the fable where the fox flatters the crow, and gains
the piece of chee&s;e, the moral was de&s;igned to &s;hew the folly of
attending to flatterers; but may equally be &s;uppo&s;ed to applaud
the cunning of the fox or flatterer, who is rewarded. In the
popular narrative of Robinson Cru&s;oe a childi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition con|cerning
intimations of future events, &s;omewhat like the &s;econd
<PB N="36" REF="35">
&s;ight of the highlands of Scotland, is frequently inculcated; and
the u&s;e of rum or brandy is propo&s;ed as an infallible cure in all
maladies; which however I am told is corrected in the new
Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe.</P>
<P>Pamela, and Jo&s;eph Andrews, and Clari&s;&s;a Harlow, are re|commended
by Madame de Genlis, and by Mrs. Macawley.
&mdash;Madame de Genlis in a note in one of her works gives her rea&s;on
for recommending Richard&s;on's novels; becau&s;e his heroins re|tain
a more con&s;iderable degree of command over their affections
than tho&s;e of apparently le&s;s exceptionable romances. In this
re&s;pect, a novel call'd &startq;Plain Sen&s;e,&endq; lately published by Lane,
and written by an ingenious Che&s;hire lady, claims the preference
to all others, and appears to me to carry this idea to exce&s;s.</P>
<P>The works of Richard&s;on are neverthele&s;s not only too vo|luminous,
and thence would con&s;ume too much time, which
might be better employ'd in &s;chools; but in the&s;e, and even in
Mr. Pope's rape of the lock, and his Eloi&s;a to Abelard, many ob|jectionable
pa&s;&s;ages of another kind may be di&s;cover'd. If the&s;e
pa&s;&s;ages, from which &s;o few books are totally exempt, were ex|punged,
it might rai&s;e curio&s;ity, and induce young people to
examine different copies of the &s;ame work, and to &s;eek for other
<PB N="37" REF="36">
improper books them&s;elves; it is therefore perhaps better, when
the&s;e books are read to a governe&s;s, that &s;he &s;hould expre&s;s di&s;|approbation
in a plain and quiet way of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, rather than
to expunge them; which would give a feeling of di&s;like to the
pupil, and confirm her delicacy, rather than give impurity to her ideas.</P>
<P>Much therefore depends on the conduct of the governe&s;s in
this re&s;pect, &s;o long as they are under the eye of a judicious
monitor, no real harm could probably arise from their &s;eeing
human nature in all the cla&s;&s;es of life, not only as it &s;hould be,
or as it may be imagined to be, but as it really exi&s;ts, &s;ince with|out
compari&s;on there can be no judgment, and con&s;equently no
real knowledge.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be ob&s;erved, that the exce&s;&s;ive &s;tudy of
novels is univer&s;ally an ill employment at any time of life; not
only becau&s;e &s;uch readers are liable to acquire a romantic ta&s;te;
and to return from the flowery &s;cenes of fiction to the common
duties of life with a degree of regret; but becau&s;e the high-wrought
&s;cenes of elegant di&s;tre&s;s di&s;play'd in novels have been
found to blunt the feelings of &s;uch readers towards real objects of
mi&s;ery; which awaken only di&s;gu&s;t in their minds in&s;tead of &s;en|timents
of pity or benevolence.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="37">
4. The works of the poets, as well as tho&s;e of the writers
of novels, require to be &s;elected with great caution. The &s;ame
may be &s;aid of painting, &s;culpture, and mu&s;ick; which by de|lighting
the imagination influence the judgment, and may thence
be employ'd either to good or bad purpo&s;es: But as poetry, when
thus &s;elected, like painting, &s;culpture, and mu&s;ick, it's rival &s;i&s;|ters,
is an object of refined ta&s;te, and affords an elegant amu&s;e|ment
at lea&s;t, it &s;o far belongs to the education of young ladies.</P>
<P>Gay's fables, Thom&s;on's &s;ea&s;ons, Gi&s;borne's walk in a fore&s;t, are
proper for the younger cla&s;&s;es of pupils; afterwards Pope's
Ethic epi&s;tles, and e&s;&s;ay on man, Gold&s;mith's poems, Akin&s;ide,
Ma&s;on, Gray, and others, which are enumerated in the cata|logue.
I forbear to mention the Botanic garden; as &s;ome ladies
have intimated to me, that the Loves of the plants are de&s;cribbed
in too glowing colours; but as the de&s;criptions are in general of
female forms in graceful attitudes, the objection is le&s;s forceable
in re&s;pect to female readers. And be&s;ides the celebrated poets of
our own country, as Milton and Shake&s;peare, tran&s;lations from
the antients, as from Homer and Virgil; and from the more mo|dern
poems of Ta&s;&s;o, and Camoens, may be read with plea&s;ure
and improvement, tho' &s;ome objectionable pa&s;&s;ages may perhaps
be found in all of them.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="38">
5. For the purpo&s;e of forming a &s;tyle in writing, a few well-cho&s;en
books &s;hould be read often over; till the ear acquires, as
it were, the mu&s;ick of the &s;entences; and the imagination is thus
enabled to copy it in our own compo&s;itions; &s;uch as tho&s;e papers
of the Spectator, which are a&s;cribed to Addi&s;on, and are termi|nated
with a capital letter of the word Clio; or &s;ome of Lady
Wortley Montague's letters from Turkey; or other works of
cha&s;te, di&s;tinct, and expre&s;&s;ive &s;tyle, not over-loaded with meta|phors,
which with &s;uperabundance of ornament injure per&s;pi|cuity.</P>
<P>But for other purpo&s;es of education it is perhaps better to teach
young people &s;elect parts of many books, than a few intire ones;
not only becau&s;e the pupils will thus be acquainted with more
authors in fa&s;hionable literature; but becau&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s of
polite education is to give the outline of many &s;pecies of erudi|tion,
or branches of knowledge; which the young ladies may
cultivate further at their future lei&s;ure without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a
teacher, as may be&s;t suit their ta&s;tes or their &s;ituations.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this &s;ection on polite learning without men|tioning,
that &s;ome illiterate men have condemned the cultivation
of the minds of the female &s;ex, and have call'd &s;uch in ridicule
<PB N="40" REF="39">
learned ladies; as if it was a reproach to render them&s;elves agree|able
and u&s;eful. Where affectation is join'd with learning, it be|comes
pedantry, but this belongs oftener to the ignorant than to
the cultivated; as is &s;o well elucidated in &startq;Letters to literary
ladies,&endq; a &s;mall duodecimo publi&s;hed by John&s;on, and written by

<P>1. An outline of Botany may be learnt from Lee's introduc|tion
to botany, and from the tran&s;lations of the works of Linnaeus by a &s;ociety at Litchfield; to which might be added Curtis's bota|nical
magazine, which is a beautiful work, and of no great ex|pence.
But there is a new treati&s;e introductory to botany call'd
Botanic dialogues for the use of &s;chools, well adapted to this pur|po&s;e,
written by M. E. Jac&s;on, a lady well &s;kill'd in botany, and
publi&s;hed by John&s;on, London. And la&s;tly I &s;hall not forbear
to mention, that the philo&s;ophical part of botany may be agree|ably
learnt from the notes to the &s;econd volume of the Botanic
garden, whether the poetry be read or not.</P>
<P>2. An outline of Chemi&s;try, which &s;urprizes and enchants
us, may be learnt from the Elements of chemi&s;try by Lavoi&s;ier,
originally publi&s;hed in french; to which may be added a &s;mall
work of Fourcroy call'd the philo&s;ophy of Chemi&s;try. The for|mer
of the&s;e illu&s;trious chemi&s;ts peri&s;h'd by the guillotine, an ir|reparable
lo&s;s to &s;cience and to mankind!</P>
<P>The acquirement of Chemi&s;try &s;hould be preceded by a &s;ketch
<PB N="42" REF="41">
of Mineralogy; which is not only an intere&s;ting branch of &s;cience,
as it teaches the knowledge of diamonds and precious &s;tones, and
of the various mines of metals, coals, and &s;alt; but becau&s;e it
explains al&s;o the difference of &s;oils, and is thus concern'd in the
theory and practice of agriculture: But there is at pre&s;ent no
proper introductory book, that I know of, on this &s;ubject for the
u&s;e of children; as Cron&s;tedt's, and Bergman's, and Kirwan's
mineralogy are too exact and prolix; nor could be well under|&s;tood
without a &s;mall collection of fo&s;&s;ils.</P>
<P>3. An outline of the &s;ciences, to which Mathematics have
generally been applied, as of a&s;tronomy, mechanics, hydro&s;tatics,
and optics, with the curious addition of electricity and mag|neti&s;m,
may be&s;t be acquired by attending the lectures in experi|mental
philo&s;ophy, which are occa&s;ionally exhibited by itinerant

name of natural philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The books in common u&s;e for teaching the&s;e &s;ciences are too
difficult and ab&s;tru&s;e for the &s;tudy of young per&s;ons. Some parts
of natural phylo&s;ophy are render'd not unentertaining in the
notes of the fir&s;t volume of the Botanic garden, as the theory of
meteors, and of winds; and an account of the &s;trata of the earth;
<PB N="43" REF="42">
which neverthele&s;s require too much attention for very young
ladies; but may be read with plea&s;ure after leaving &s;chool by
tho&s;e, who po&s;&s;e&s; inquiring minds. It is to be wi&s;hed that &s;ome
writer of juvenile books would endeavour ea&s;ily to explain the
&s;tructure and u&s;e of the barometer, and thermometer, and of
clocks and watches, which &s;upply a part of the furniture of our
hou&s;es, and of our pockets.</P>
<P>4. In the &s;ame manner the various arts and manufactories,
which adorn and enrich this country, &s;hould occa&s;ionally be
&s;hewn and explain'd to young per&s;ons, as &s;o many ingenious parts
of experimental philo&s;ophy; as well as from their immediately
contributing to the convenience of life, and to the wealth of the
nations, which have invented or establi&s;hed them. Of the&s;e are
the cotton works on the river Derwent in Derby&s;hire; the pot|teries
in Stafford&s;hire; the iron-founderies of Coalbrooke Dale in
Shrop&s;hire; the manufactories of Birmingham, Manche&s;ter, Not|tingham;
but the&s;e are not in the province of a boarding &s;chool,
but might be advantageou&s;ly exhibited to young ladies by their
parents in the &s;ummer vacations.</P>
<P>5. In this &s;ection of arts and &s;ciences it may be proper to
mention the art of producing a technical memory invented by
<PB N="44" REF="43">
Mr. Gray; which may be readily acquired by con&s;ulting his
book, and may perhaps be of advantage in remembering dates or
numbers; as they are expre&s;s'd by letters, and form'd into words.
This work I attended to in my youth, but found it an amusing
trick, rather than an u&s;eful art.</P>
<P>6. The art of writing Short-hand, which is &s;aid to be of
Engli&s;h invention, &s;hould al&s;o be mentioned in this place. The
book I learn'd this art from was publi&s;h'd by Gurney, and &s;aid
to be an improvement on Ma&s;on; other treati&s;es of &s;hort-hand I
have al&s;o examined, but found them all nearly of equal excel|lence.
I can only add, that many volumes, which I wrote from
medical lectures, I now find difficult to decypher; and that as the
words in &s;hort-hand are &s;pelt from their &s;ound only; tho&s;e &s;cho|lars,
who practi&s;e this art early in life, are liable not afterwards
to &s;pell our language correctly; and la&s;tly, that I believe, this
art is &s;till capable of improvement by fir&s;t forming a more accu|rate
alphabet, than that in common u&s;e among all european
nations.</P>
<P>7. This &s;ection on arts and &s;ciences may perhaps be thought
to include more branches of them, than is nece&s;&s;ary for female
erudition. But as in male education the tedious acquirement of
<PB N="45" REF="44">
antient languages for the purpo&s;e of &s;tudying poetry and oratory
is gradually giving way to the more u&s;eful cultivation of modern
&s;ciences, it may be of advantage to ladies of the ri&s;ing generation
to acquire an outline of &s;imilar knowledge; as they are in future
life to become companions; and one of the greate&s;t plea&s;ures re|ceived
in conver&s;ation con&s;i&s;ts in being reciprocally well under|&s;tood.

<P>THE criterion of moral duties has been variou&s;ly delivered by
different writers: Expediency, by which is meant whatever in|crea&s;es
the &s;um of public happine&s;s, is by &s;ome called the crite|rion
of virtue; and whatever dimini&s;hes that &s;um is term'd vice.
By others the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of the individual, if rightly
under&s;tood, is &s;aid to be the bond of moral obligation. And la&s;tly,
by others the will of God is &s;aid to con&s;titute the &s;ole criterion of
virtue and vice.</P>

But be&s;ides &s;y&s;tematic books of morality, which are generally

<ITEM>1. A &s;ympathy with the pains and plea&s;ures of others, or
compa&s;&s;ion.</ITEM>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">COMPASSION.</HEAD>
<P>A Sympathy with the pains and plea&s;ures of others is the
foundation of all our &s;ocial virtues. &startq;DO AS YOU WOULD BE
DONE BY,&endq; is a precept, which de&s;cended from heaven. Who|ever
feels pain him&s;elf, when he &s;ees others affected with it, will
not only never be liable to give pain, but will always be inclined
<PB N="47" REF="46">
to relieve it. The lady, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this chri&s;tian virtue of com|pa&s;&s;ion,
cannot but be a good daughter, a good wife, and a good
mother, that is, an amiable character in every department of
life.</P>
<P>The manner of communicating this benevolent &s;ympathy to
children con&s;i&s;ts in expre&s;&s;ing our own &s;ympathy, when any thing
cruel pre&s;ents it&s;elf; as in the de&s;truction of an in&s;ect; or when
actions of cruelty are related in books or in conver&s;ation. I once
ob&s;erved a lady with apparent expre&s;&s;ions of &s;ympathy &s;ay to her
little daughter, who was pulling off the legs of a fly, &startq;how
&s;hould you like to have your arms and legs pull'd off? would it
not give you great pain? pray let it fly away out of the win|dow:&endq;
which I doubt not would make an indelible impre&s;&s;ion
on the child, and lay the foundation of an amiable character.</P>
<P>This virtue of compa&s;&s;ion is a certain foundation of benevo|lence;
and on that account renders children good to their own
parents in the latter part of their lives, as well as to all other
people; an important circum&s;tance to the happine&s;s of our latter
years! Where cruelty or malevolence re&s;ides in the brea&s;t, it is
generally exerci&s;ed mo&s;t by the child upon the aged parent, with
whom in civilized &s;ociety he frequently re&s;ides; and who often
<PB N="48" REF="47">
lives &s;o long as to &s;tand in his way to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a wi&s;h'd-for
inheritance.</P>
<P>This compa&s;&s;ion, or &s;ympathy with the pains of others, ought
al&s;o to extend to the brute creation, as far as our nece&s;&s;ities will
admit; for we cannot exi&s;t long without the de&s;truction of other
animal or vegetable beings either in their mature or embryon
&s;tate. Such is the condition of mortality, that the fir&s;t law of
nature is &startq;eat, or be eaten.&endq; Hence for the pre&s;ervation of our
exi&s;tence we may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have a natural right to kill tho&s;e
brute creatures, which we want to eat, or which want to eat us;
but to de&s;troy even in&s;ects wantonly &s;hews an unreflecting mind,
or a depraved heart.</P>
<P>A young gentleman once a&s;&s;ured me, that he had lately fallen
in love with a young lady; but, on their walking out one even|ing
in &s;ummer, &s;he took two or three &s;teps out of her way on the
gravel walk to tread upon an in&s;ect; and that afterwards when|ever
the idea of her came into his mind, it was attended with this
picture of active cruelty, till that of the lady ceased to be agree|able,
and he relinqui&s;hed his de&s;ign of court&s;hip.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s this &s;ympathy, however amiable and nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="49" REF="48">
may be carried to an extreme, &s;o as to render mi&s;erable the per|&s;on,
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it; &s;ince many pitiable objects mu&s;t be &s;een in
our journey through life, which we have not power to relieve.
This then furni&s;hes us with a barrier or line, where to &s;top; that
is, we &s;hould endeavour to render our little pupils alive to &s;ym|pathize
with all remediable evils; and at the &s;ame time to arm
them with fortitude to bear the &s;ight of &s;uch irremediable evils,
as the accidents of life mu&s;t frequently pre&s;ent before their eyes.</P>
<P>There &s;hould al&s;o be a plan in &s;chools to promote the habit as
well as the principle of benevolence; each young lady might
occa&s;ionally contribute a &s;mall &s;um on &s;eeing a needy naked child
to purcha&s;e flannel or coar&s;e linen for clothes, which they might
learn to cut out, and to make up them&s;elves; and thus the prac|ti&s;e
of indu&s;try might be united with that of liberality.</P>
<P>Another &s;till more practical mode of producing a habit of be|nevolence
in children might be by inducing them to employ &s;ome
lei&s;ure hours in little works of ta&s;te, as in making artificial flow|ers,
pur&s;es, fringes, and be&s;towing the&s;e on poor people, in order
that they might &s;ell them for their &s;upport. Mi&s;s Hartley at
Bath, the daughter of the great medical philo&s;opher of that
name, has lately exhibited an amiable example of this kind of
<PB N="50" REF="49">
philanthropy; &s;he has been long di&s;tingui&s;hed by her talents as
an arti&s;t in painting; and has lately di&s;tributed her elegant per|formances
among the poor fami&s;hed emigrants, who re&s;ide in her
neighbourhood; who are thus greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;ale of her
works.</P>
<P>Another channel, in which this &s;ympathy &s;hould be taught to
flow, is in the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e attentions, which perpetually
diffu&s;e happine&s;s by promoting by courte&s;y of behaviour the
cheerfulne&s;s, or forwarding by ready a&s;&s;i&s;tance the intere&s;ts of
tho&s;e, whether equals, inferiors, or &s;uperiors; with whom every
one happens to a&s;&s;ociate or re&s;ide: which con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ential
part of what is termed politene&s;s of manners; and univer&s;ally
indicates a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">VERACITY.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the purpo&s;e of inculcating a love of truth early in life
the love of prai&s;e &s;upplies the mo&s;t certain means. This kind of
<PB N="51" REF="50">
honour has an hone&s;t pride for it's ba&s;is: a &s;tory is related in one
of the modern volumes of the univer&s;al hi&s;tory of an inhabitant
of Con&s;tantinople, who was brought to the &s;caffold for denying
the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Mahomet; and on having a pardon offered
him, if he would then declare his error, an&s;wer'd, that he would
not &s;peak an untruth to &s;ave his life. And, I think, it is re|corded,
that one of the fathers of the church u&s;ed to affirm, that
he would not tell a lie, were he &s;ure to gain heaven by it.</P>
<P>I once heard an ingenious lady &s;ay to a company of her friends,
that her daughter, a young girl, who &s;tood by with a counte|nance
flu&s;h'd with plea&s;ure, never told her a lie in her life: This
happy u&s;e of flattery was likely to produce a love for veracity,
which would never be de&s;troy'd by intere&s;ted motives.</P>
<P>The di&s;grace of telling a lie &s;hould be painted in vivid colours,
as totally de&s;tructive of the character of a lady or gentleman, ren|dering
them contemptible in the eyes of the world: And the
inconvenience of this dete&s;table habit of lying &s;hould be explain'd
from it's preventing their being believed, when they wi&s;h it; as is
exemplified in the fable of the &s;hepherd-boy; who call'd out
&startq;the wolf, the wolf,&endq; &s;o often to alarm his neighbours, and thus
to amu&s;e him&s;elf, when no wolf was near; that when the real
<PB N="52" REF="51">
wolf attack'd his flock, he could by no vociferation prevail on
any one to come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: Or like the village-drunkard,
who frequently amu&s;ed him&s;elf with crying out &startq;fire,&endq; along
the &s;treets on his return from the ale-hou&s;e in the night, to the
great alarm of the neighbourhood; till at length, when his cot|tage
was really in flames, his di&s;tre&s;s was not believed, and he
could gain no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to extingui&s;h them.</P>
<P>This &s;incerity of character &s;hould be confirm'd by the example
of the governe&s;&s;es, who &s;hould them&s;elves pay the mo&s;t exact and
&s;crupulous attention to truth; they &s;hould not exaggerate trifling
errors into reprehen&s;ible faults; and, where reproof is nece&s;&s;ary,
&s;hould give it with kindne&s;s: and &s;hould not only punctually ful|fil
their own promi&s;es, tho' to their inconvenience, but exact the
&s;ame from their pupils in return.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;hould be added the precepts of religion, as
&s;oon as their minds are capable of receiving them, which uniformly in|culcate
truth and probity in all our words and actions.</P>

<P>THE impre&s;&s;ions on the mind made by recent examples
placed, as it were, before our eyes have &s;o much more durable
effects, than the more ab&s;tracted ideas deliver'd in &s;y&s;tems of
moral philo&s;ophy; that I believe the mo&s;t efficacious method of
inculcating the virtue of prudence in re&s;pect to their own conduct
is by telling young people the ill con&s;equences, which have
lately happen'd to others; who&s;e per&s;ons or names they are ac|quainted
with: &s;o that a repetition of the &s;lander of a town,
which always degrades the retailers, has &s;ometimes it's advan|tage
as a le&s;&s;on to the hearers.</P>
<P>There is another kind of prudence, which it is nece&s;&s;ary to
acquire in &s;ome degree, which arms the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or again&s;t the ill
de&s;igns of others; hence they &s;hould be taught to beware of flat|terers,
game&s;ters, drunkards, and of all ill-temper'd per&s;ons. As
this prudence is to be acquired by the knowledge of mankind,
<PB N="54" REF="53">
&s;uch books as the maxims of Rochfoucault, and others, might be
recommended; but they give too gloomy a picture of human
nature to be put into the hands of young ladies.</P>
<P>&startq;Know your&s;elf&endq; is a celebrated injunction, and may con|&s;titute
one department of Prudence, when any one undertakes
&s;ome great action, or great change in the condition of life; but
&startq;know other people&endq; is equally nece&s;&s;ary in pa&s;&s;ing along this
&s;ublunary world, and may be in&s;erted with propriety as another
maxim in the code of prudence. The facility of knowing
others in the daily intercourse of the world is produced by the
knowledge of phy&s;iognomy, acquired at &s;chools in early life;
while the pa&s;&s;ions continue to be impre&s;s'd on the countenances
of children; and which is never &s;o well acquired in private tui|tion;
and thus con&s;titutes one of the great advantages of &s;chool-education.</P>
<P>JUSTICE and CHASTITY, which are the principal links, by
which civilized &s;ociety is held together, are to be inculcated in
young minds by &s;imilar methods; that is by pointing out by ex|amples
the public puni&s;hment, or public di&s;grace, which certainly
accompanies the breach of either of the&s;e important duties: and
afterwards to add the precepts of religion, when their minds are
<PB N="55" REF="54">
capable of perceiving their force, to co-operate with the effect
of the laws of &s;ociety, and of the opinion of the wife and

<HEAD TYPE="sub">FORTITUDE.</HEAD>
<P>IF female children are not treated with tenderne&s;s by a mother
in their early years of infancy, they are perhaps liable to acquire
a har&s;hne&s;s of character, and an apparent unfeelingne&s;s, which
afterwards renders them le&s;s amiable; though it may give them
greater fortitude; which &s;hould therefore be inculcated at their
rather maturer years.</P>
<P>Neither the robu&s;t a&s;&s;ailing courage, which prompts to the
performance of heroic actions, nor the o&s;tentatious patience,
which requires the flattery of the public eye for its's &s;upport,
belong to the female character. But that &s;erene &s;trength of mind,
which faces unavoidable danger with open eyes, prepared to
counteract or to bear the nece&s;&s;ary evils of life, is equally valu|able
<PB N="56" REF="55">
as a male or female acqui&s;ition. This is term'd pre&s;ence of
mind; it depends on our judgment of the real value of things;
and on our application of tho&s;e cau&s;es, which contribute to turn
di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances to the be&s;t advantage; and can there|fore
only be acquired by the general cultivation of good &s;en&s;e and
of knowledge.</P>
<P>An occa&s;ional effu&s;ion of tears has been thought an amiable
weakne&s;s, and a mark of delicacy of the &s;ex. When tears are
&s;hed at the irremediable misfortunes of others, it indicates an
amiable &s;en&s;ibility; but when young ladies indulge them&s;elves in
a promptitude of di&s;&s;olving into ince&s;&s;ant tears at every trivial
distre&s;s of their own, it &s;hews a kind of infantine debility of
mind, and conveys an idea of their being unfit for the common
duties of life; and &s;hould therefore be di&s;couraged by rea&s;oning
on the kind and quantity of the evil, which di&s;turbs them; and
by reciting to them the examples of fortitude exhibited by others
in di&s;a&s;ters much more calamitous, of which there are examples
in the letters of Lady Ru&s;&s;el: And la&s;tly by reminding them of
the con&s;olations of religion.</P>
<P>A &s;light appearance of timidity has been e&s;teem'd another
mark of delicacy of the &s;ex; but timidity is the companion of
<PB N="57" REF="56">
debility of mind rather than of delicacy, and &s;hould not therefore
be encouraged. In re&s;pect to the expre&s;&s;ions of fear the violent
cries and di&s;torted countenances of &s;ome ladies in &s;ituations of
danger exhibit them in no very amiable attitudes; while they
increa&s;e the confu&s;ion, and may be said &startq;to help the &s;torm;&endq;
but if to the&s;e be added an affectation of fear without cau&s;e; as
when a young lady &s;creams through the whole gamut at the &s;ight
of a &s;pider, or a gra&s;s-hopper; the fault becomes voluntary, and
&s;hould be oppo&s;ed and conquer'd by the &s;hafts of ridicule.</P>
<P>Impudence in common language has been termed boldne&s;s;
and ba&s;hfulne&s;s has been a&s;cribed to timidity; but neither of
them with &s;ufficient preci&s;ion; as brave men have been known
to be ba&s;hful, and cowards impudent. A&s;&s;urance of counte|nance
ari&s;es from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it rather over-valuing his own
abilities; and impudence con&s;i&s;ts in this a&s;&s;urance with a total
di&s;regard of the opinions of others; but neither of them bear any
analogy to fortitude. On the other hand mode&s;ty ari&s;es from the
po&s;&s;e&s;sor of it rather under-valuing his own abilities; and ba&s;h|fulne&s;s
con&s;i&s;ts in this mode&s;ty with great &s;olicitude about the
opinions of others; but neither of them are attended with per|&s;onal
fear. So charming is the appearance of this great &s;en&s;ibi|lity
by adding a blu&s;h to the features of beauty, that no endea|vours
<PB N="58" REF="57">
&s;hould be u&s;ed to extingui&s;h it early in life. Nor &s;hould
any means be contrived to increa&s;e it to exce&s;s, as embarra&s;&s;ment

&s;mile of flattery, nor the &s;mile of &s;elf-approbation, nor the &s;mile
of habit, nor of levity; but it is &s;imply an expre&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ure,
which &s;eems to ari&s;e at the &s;ight of our acquaintance; and which
per&s;uades them, that they po&s;&s;e&s;s our love, and for which they
barter their own in return.</P>
<P>However this conciliating manner may have been u&s;ed, as
above related, for bad purpo&s;es; it probably proceeded originally
from friendline&s;s and opene&s;s of heart, with cheerful benevo|lence;
and that in tho&s;e, who have in proce&s;s of time become
<PB N="62" REF="61">
bad characters, the appearance of tho&s;e virtues has remain'd, after
the reality of them has vani&s;h'd. What then is the method, by
which this inchantment of countenance can be taught? certainly
by in&s;tilling cheerfulne&s;s and benevolence into the minds of
young ladies early in life, and at the &s;ame time an animation of
countenance in expre&s;&s;ing them; and though this plea&s;urable ani|mation
be at fir&s;t only copied, it will in time have the appearance
of being natural; and will contribute to produce by a&s;&s;ociation
the very cheerfulne&s;s and benevolence, which it at fir&s;t only imi|tated.
This is a golden ob&s;ervation to tho&s;e, who have the care
of young children.</P>
<P>A very accompli&s;h'd lady, who read the manu&s;cript of this

&startq;nothing can be more ju&s;t and intere&s;ting than the whole of this

of manner, that an attempt to engraft this beautiful cheerful|ne&s;s
on a grave &s;et of features might produce the wor&s;t of evil
affectations? A natural &s;implicity of manner, whether &s;erious or
gay, will always plea&s;e; and probably this amiable addre&s;s may
be rendered equally con&s;i&s;tent with natural manners, whether &s;e|rious

<HEAD TYPE="sub">CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to the winning manners above de&s;cribed, the art of
plea&s;ing in conver&s;ation &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in two things; one of
them to hear well; and the other to &s;peak well. The perpetual
appearance of attention, and the varying expre&s;&s;ion of the coun|tenance
of the hearer to the &s;entiments or pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;peaker,
is a principal charm in conver&s;ation; to be well heard and accu|rately
under&s;tood encourages our companions to proceed with
plea&s;ure, whatever may be the topics of their di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who have been educated at &s;chools, and have learnt
the knowledge of phy&s;iognomy from their playfellows in their
early years, under&s;tand the plea&s;urable or painful feelings of all
with whom they conver&s;e, often even before their words are
fini&s;hed; and, by thus immediately conforming the expression of
their own features to the &s;en&s;ations of the &s;peaker, become the
intere&s;ting and animated companions above de&s;cribed, which is
<PB N="64" REF="63">
&s;eldom &s;een in tho&s;e educated in private families; and which, as
before ob&s;erved, gives a preference to &s;chool-education.</P>
<P>To &s;peak agreeably in re&s;pect to manner con&s;i&s;ts in a voice
clear, yet not loud; &s;oft, yet not plaintive; with di&s;tinct articu|lation,
and with graceful attitudes rather than with graceful
actions; as almo&s;t every kind of ge&s;ticulation is di&s;agreeable. In
re&s;pect to the matter it &s;hould be &s;uch, as coincides with the
ta&s;tes or pur&s;uits of tho&s;e, to whom the conver&s;ation is addre&s;s'd.
From hence it will appear, that both to hear well, and to &s;peak
well, requires an exten&s;ive knowledge of things; as well as of
the ta&s;tes and pur&s;uits of mankind; and mu&s;t therefore ultimately
be the effect of a good education in general, rather than a parti|cular
article of it.</P>
<P>There are however faults to be avoided, and cautions to be
ob&s;erved, in the conver&s;ation of young ladies; which &s;hould be
pointed out to them by the governe&s;s of a boarding &s;chool. Of
these I &s;hall mention fir&s;t, that whenever the thir&s;t of &s;hining in
conver&s;ation &s;eizes on the heart, the vanity of the &s;peaker be|comes
apparent; and we are di&s;gu&s;ted with the manner, what|ever
may be the matter of the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="64">
Secondly, that it is always childi&s;h, and generally ridiculous,
when young people boa&s;t of their follies, or when they accu&s;e
them&s;elves of virtues; neither of which they probably po&s;&s;e&s;s in
the degree, which they de&s;cribe. A young lady was heard to
say, &startq;I am frighten'd to death at the &s;ight of a bird:&endq; And
another, that &s;he was &s;o incon&s;iderate, as to give her money to
the poor naked children, whom &s;he &s;aw in the &s;treets in winter.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they &s;hould be apprized, that there is danger in
&s;peaking ill even of a bad per&s;on; both becau&s;e they may have
been mi&s;inform'd, and becau&s;e they &s;hould judge their neighbours
with charity. A friend of mine was once a&s;k'd by a young man,
how he could di&s;tinguish, whether the lady, whom he meant to
addre&s;s, was good temper'd; and gave this an&s;wer. &startq;When any
dubious accu&s;ation is brought in conver&s;ation again&s;t an ab&s;ent
per&s;on; if &s;he always inclines to believe the wor&s;t &s;ide of the
que&s;tion, &s;he is ill-temper'd.&endq; There are &s;ome nice di&s;tinctions
on this &s;ubject of good nature delivered in Lady Pennington's
advice to her daughters, p. 89, which are worth a young lady's
attention.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that it is dangerous for a young lady to &s;peak very
highly in prai&s;e even of a de&s;erving man; for if &s;he extols his
<PB N="66" REF="65">
actions, &s;he will &s;eem to give her&s;elf the importance of a judge,
and her determinations will &s;ometimes be call'd in que&s;tion; and
to commend highly the per&s;on of a man is in general e&s;timation
incon&s;i&s;tent with the delicacy of the &s;ex at any age.</P>
<P>Fifthly, young ladies &s;hould be advi&s;ed not to accu&s;tom them|&s;elves
to the u&s;e of &s;trong a&s;&s;everations, or of a kind of petty
oaths, &s;uch as &startq;upon my honour,&endq; in their conver&s;ation; nor
often to appeal to others for the truth of what they affirm; &s;ince
all &s;uch &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions and appeals derogate &s;omewhat from
the character of the &s;peaker; as they give an intimation, that &s;he
has not been u&s;ually believed on her &s;imple a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Sixthly, laughing vehemently aloud, or tittering with &s;hort
&s;hrieks, in which &s;ome young ladies, who have left &s;chool, in|dulge
them&s;elves at cards or other amu&s;ements, are reprehen&s;ible;
as their dignity of character mu&s;t &s;uffer by appearing too violently
agitated at trivial circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Seventhly, an uniform adherence to &s;incerity in conver&s;ation
is of the fir&s;t importance; as without it our words are but empty
&s;ounds, and can no more intere&s;t our companions than the tinkling
of a bell. No artificial poli&s;h of manners can compen&s;ate for the
<PB N="67" REF="66">
apparent want of this virtue, nor any acquirements of knowledge
for the reality of the want of it. Hence though the exce&s;s of
blame or prai&s;e of the actions of others may be imprudent or im|proper
in the conver&s;ation of young ladies; as mentioned in the
third and fourth articles of this &s;ection; yet in the&s;e, as in all
other kinds of conver&s;ation, their opinions &s;hould be given with
truth, if given at all; but when the characters of others are con|cern'd,
they &s;hould be delivered with diffidence and mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, if at any time any improper di&s;cour&s;e &s;hould be ad|dre&s;s'd
to young ladies, which has a tendency to indecency, im|morality,
or irreligion, they &s;hould be taught to expre&s;s a marked
di&s;approbation both in words and countenance. So great is the
power of the &s;ofter &s;ex in meliorating the characters of men;
that, if &s;uch was their uniform behaviour, I doubt not, but that
it would much contribute to reform the morals of the age; an
event devoutly to be wi&s;hed, and which would contribute much
to their own happine&s;s.</P>
<P>To the&s;e might be added many other ob&s;ervations from the
writers on female education, concerning a due re&s;pect in conver|&s;ation
to &s;uperiors, good temper to equals, and conde&s;cen&s;ion to
inferiors. But as young ladies are not expected to &s;peak with the
<PB N="68" REF="67">
wi&s;dom, or preci&s;ion of philo&s;ophers; and as the carele&s;s cheer|fulne&s;s
of their conver&s;ation, with &s;implicity of manner, and with
the grace, ea&s;e, and vivacity natural to youth, &s;upplies it with
it's principal charms; the&s;e &s;hould be particularly encouraged, as
there are few artificial accompli&s;hments, which could Compen&s;ate
for the lo&s;s of them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">EXERCISE.</HEAD>
<P>THE acquirements of literature, and of many arts, make the
lives of young people too &s;edentary; which impairs their &s;trength,
makes their countenances pale and bloated, and lays the founda|tion
of many di&s;ea&s;es; hence &s;ome hours &s;hould every day be
appropriated to bodily exerci&s;es, and to relaxation of mind.</P>
<P>Such as tend to produce activity, and to promote the growth
of the per&s;on in re&s;pect to height, are prefer'd in the &s;chools for
young ladies to tho&s;e, which render the &s;y&s;tem more robu&s;t and
mu&s;cular.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="68">
Of the&s;e playing at ball, at &s;huttlecock, &s;winging as they &s;it
on a cord or cu&s;hion, and dancing, in the open air in &s;ummer,
and within doors in winter, are to be prefer'd. To the&s;e &s;ome
have recommended an exerci&s;e of the arms by &s;winging leaden
weights, which are call'd dumb bells; the&s;e &s;hould be very light,
if they be u&s;ed at all, otherwi&s;e they load the &s;pine of the back,
and render the &s;houlders thick and mu&s;cular, and rather impede
than forward the perpendicular growth of the per&s;on. The ring|ing
of a real bell hung as is done in churches, or the frequent
drawing up of a weight by a cord over a pulley, with a fly-wheel
to prevent it's too ha&s;ty de&s;cent, would be an exerci&s;e, which
might be u&s;ed with great advantage by young people; as it both
extends the &s;pine, and &s;trengthens the mu&s;cles of the che&s;t and
arms.</P>
<P>Many other kinds of exerci&s;e have been recommended by
authors: Madam Genlis advi&s;es weights to be carried on the
head, as milk-maids carry their milk-pails; and even to add
weights to the &s;oles of the &s;hoes of children to &s;trengthen, as &s;he
&s;uppo&s;es, the mu&s;cles of locomotion in walking or running. It
is evident, that carrying weights on the head mu&s;t be injurious
to young people, e&s;pecially where there is a tendency to &s;oftne&s;s
of the bones; as it may contribute to bend the &s;pine by their pre&s;|&s;ure,
<PB N="70" REF="69">
and to impede the perpendicular growth of the body; and
the walking in weighted &s;hoes may induce awkward ge&s;tures
without any adequate advantage.</P>
<P>There are other modes of exertion, which, though graceful in
them&s;elves, are not allow'd to ladies by the fa&s;hion of this age
and country; as &s;kating on the ice in winter, &s;wimming in &s;um|mer,
funambulation, or dancing on the &s;treight rope: but walk|ing
with a &s;tately mea&s;ured &s;tep occa&s;ionally, like the march of
&s;oldiers, and reading aloud frequently rather in a theatric man|ner,
as well as dancing and &s;inging, will much contribute to
give &s;trength and grace to the mu&s;cles of locomotion, and of
vocallity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Section XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">AIR.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;trength and activity of young people not only depends
on the perpetual exerci&s;e of their limbs, as de&s;cribed in the preced|ing
&s;ections, but on the purity of the air, which they breathe, and
<PB N="71" REF="70">
even on the occa&s;ional coldne&s;s of it. The cold air of winter
acts on delicate people like a cold bath; as it dimini&s;hes the action
of the &s;ubcutaneous ve&s;&s;els for a time, and thus produces an accu|mulation
of animal power, whence an increased action of tho&s;e
ve&s;&s;els and a con&s;equent warmth of the &s;urface of the body &s;uc|ceeds;
and by this le&s;s expenditure of animal power during im|mer&s;ion
in cold air, and it's con&s;equent accumulation, the per|&s;on
becomes &s;tronger for a time and more animated; which is
termed in common language &startq;bracing the &s;y&s;tem.&endq; Hence to
&s;trengthen delicate children they &s;hould be encouraged to go into
the cold air of winter frequently, but &s;hould not remain in it
longer than a quarter or half an hour at a time. In &s;ummer
young people can &s;carcely continue too much in the air, where
they are &s;haded from the heat of the &s;un.</P>
<P>A con&s;tant immer&s;ion in pure air is now known to contribute
much both to the health of the &s;ystem, and to the beautiful co|lour
of the complexion. And this atmo&s;phere &s;hould undergo a
perpetual change and renovation; that the vital air, which con|&s;titutes
about one-fourth part of it, may not be too much dimi|ni&s;hed
by frequent re&s;piration. Due attention &s;hould be given to
this important circum&s;tance both by frequently urging the young
ladies to amu&s;e them&s;elves out of doors; and by the proper venti|lation
<PB N="72" REF="71">
of the &s;chool-room, dining-room, bed-rooms, and their
other apartments. For this purpo&s;e it is convenient to &s;aw off
about one inch from the top of every door of the&s;e crowded
rooms, and oppo&s;ite to this aperture to nail along the top of the
door a tin plate about two inches wide, ri&s;ing at an angle of about
forty-five degrees; which will bend the current of air up towards
the ceiling; where it will be mixed with the warm air of the
room, and &s;ink down among&s;t the &s;ociety without the danger of
giving cold to any one: And, be&s;ides the&s;e door-ventilators, the
upper &s;a&s;hes of every window &s;hould always be let down a few
inches, when the external weather will admit of it.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to bed-rooms, which have more than one bed, the
doors &s;hould be furni&s;hed with &s;imilar ventilators for the due ad|mi&s;&s;ion
of fre&s;h air; and during the &s;ummer months a window
&s;hould be kept a few inches open during the night as well as the
day; the &s;a&s;h of which &s;hould have a bolt or other proper fa&s;ten|ing
for this purpo&s;e; nor &s;hould the fire-place be &s;topt up at any
&s;ea&s;on by a chimney board, or a bag of &s;traw; as many rooms are
made to &s;hut up &s;o clo&s;e, that this is the only aperture, by which
fre&s;h air is admitted. To this &s;hould be added, that the bed cur|tains
&s;hould never be drawn close round the beds; which confine
the air &s;poil'd by frequent re&s;piration, and the per&s;pirable matter,
<PB N="73" REF="72">
like a noxious atmo&s;phere over the uncon&s;cious &s;leepers. At the
&s;ame time none of the beds &s;hould be placed very near either to
an open window, or to an open chimney, as a partial current of
air might be injurious by the coldne&s;s it might occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In crowded bed-rooms, where children are clo&s;e &s;hut up for
eight or nine hours every night, not only the pale bloated com|plexion,
which is &s;een in children of crowded manufactories; but
other di&s;ea&s;es are produced by the impurity of the air, &s;uch as
indige&s;tion, difficulty of breathing, and &s;ometimes convul&s;ive
fits, as mention'd in Zoonomia, vol. II. cla&s;s iii. 1. 1. 5. and
la&s;tly putrid fevers; of which fatal in&s;tances frequently occur in
the crowded habitations of the poor. Hence parents cannot be
too careful in in&s;pecting the bed-rooms, and the beds of the
&s;chools, to which they intru&s;t their children; as not only their
pre&s;ent comfort, but their future health, and &s;ometimes their
lives depend on this attention; as is further explain'd in the &s;ec|tion
on rheumati&s;m.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the due ventilation of rooms by a perpetual &s;upply of
pure air in &s;ummer, &s;omething &s;hould be here &s;aid about the
manner of warming them in winter. As the quantity of air car|ried
up a chimney is very great, owing to it's being render'd &s;o
<PB N="74" REF="73">
much lighter than the external atmo&s;phere by the heat of the
fire, &s;trong currents of cold air pre&s;s into the room at every chink
of the doors and windows pa&s;&s;ing towards the fire; and are liable
to give catarrh, rheumati&s;m, kibed heels, and &s;welled fingers to
tho&s;e &s;cholars, who are expo&s;ed to them. To le&s;&s;en the&s;e currents
of cold air &s;etting in at every aperture, the chimney &s;hould be
&s;o contracted over the fire-grate, as to admit no more of the warm
air to go up it, than is nece&s;&s;ary to carry up the &s;moke; and
hence much more of the warm air near the fire-place will ri&s;e
up to the ceiling; and de&s;cending, as it becomes cooler, in the
di&s;tant parts of the room, will form a kind of vertical eddy, and
warm the whole appartment; adding greatly to the heat pro|duced
by the radiation from the fire.</P>
<P>To effect this Doctor Franklin recommended an iron or tin
plate to &s;lide under the mantle-piece over the fire, &s;o as to leave con|tract
the aperture of the chimney to two or three inches in width,
all the length over the fire-grate. And lately Count Rumford
has accompli&s;h'd the &s;ame purpo&s;e by a flat &s;tone about twelve
inches broad, and eighteen inches high; which is rear'd upon
one end at the back of the fire-place, about eight inches above
the grate, and leans forward towards the mantle-piece, &s;o as to
an aperture, three or four inches wide, and twelve or four|teen
<PB N="75" REF="74">
inches long, over the front of the fire-place. The u&s;e of
both the&s;e contrivances is to contract the mouth of the chimney,
and thus to admit no more warm air up it, than is nece&s;&s;ary to
convey the smoke. And the &s;liding iron plate in Franklin's plan,
and the end-reared &s;tone in Rumford's plan, are de&s;igned to be
occa&s;ionally withdrawn for the admittance of the chimney-&s;weeper.
The&s;e are de&s;cribed in detail in the e&s;&s;ays of Doctor
Franklin, and Count Rumford; and it is believed, that one-third
of the fuel may be thus &s;aved, and the rooms be kept more
equally warm, and more &s;alutary.</P>

<HEAD>Section XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CARE OF THE SHAPE.</HEAD>
<P>DELICATE young ladies are very liable to become awry at
many boarding &s;chools, this is occa&s;ion'd principally by their
being obliged too long to pre&s;erve an erect attitude, by &s;itting on
forms for many hours together. To prevent this the &s;chool-&s;eats
&s;hould either have backs, on which they may occa&s;ionally rest
them&s;elves; or de&s;ks before them, on which they may occa&s;ion|ally
<PB N="76" REF="75">
lean. This is a thing of greater con&s;equence, than may
appear to tho&s;e, who have not attended to it; and who wi&s;h their
children to acquire a very erect attitude.</P>
<P>When the lea&s;t tendency to become awry is ob&s;erved, they
&s;hould be advi&s;ed to lie down on a bed or &s;ofa for an hour in the
middle of the day for many months; which generally prevents
the increa&s;e of this deformity by taking off for a time the pre&s;&s;ure
of the head and neck and &s;houlders on the &s;pine of the back; and
it at the &s;ame time tends to make them grow taller.</P>
<P>Young per&s;ons, when nicely mea&s;ured, are found to be half
an inch higher in the morning than at night; as is well known
to tho&s;e, who inli&s;t very young men for &s;oldiers. This is owing
to the cartilages between the bones of the back becoming com|pre&s;s'd
by the weight of the head and &s;houlders on them during
the day. It is the &s;ame pre&s;&s;ure, which produces curvitures and
di&s;tortions of the &s;pine in growing children, where the bones are
&s;ofter than u&s;ual; and which may thus be relieved by an hori|zontal
po&s;ture for an hour in the middle of the day, or by being
frequently allow'd to lean on a chair, or to play on a carpet on
the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="76">
Young ladies &s;hould al&s;o be directed, where two &s;leep in a
bed, to change every night, or every week, their &s;ides of the bed;
which will prevent their tendency to &s;leep always on the &s;ame
&s;ide; which is not only liable to produce crookedne&s;s, but al&s;o
to occa&s;ion di&s;ea&s;es by the internal parts being &s;o long kept
in uniform contact as to grow together. For the &s;ame rea|&s;on
they &s;hould not be allow'd to &s;it always on the &s;ame &s;ide
of the fire or window; becau&s;e they will then be inclined too
frequently to bend towards one &s;ide; which in those con&s;titutions,
where the bones are too &s;oft, is liable to produce crookedne&s;s of
the &s;pine.</P>
<P>Another great cau&s;e of injury to the &s;hape of young ladies is
from the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;tays, or other tight bandages; which at the
&s;ame time cau&s;e other di&s;ea&s;es by changing the form or &s;ituation
of the internal parts. If a hard part of the &s;tays, even a knot of
the thread, with which they are &s;ewed together, is pre&s;s'd upon
one &s;ide more than the other; the child bends from the &s;ide,
which is unea&s;y, and thus occa&s;ions a curiviture of the &s;pine.
To counteract this effect &s;uch &s;tays, as have fewe&s;t hard parts,
and e&s;pecially &s;uch as can be daily or weekly turn'd, are prefer|able
to others. A wi&s;e fa&s;hion of wearing no &s;tiff &s;tays, which
<PB N="78" REF="77">
adds &s;o much to the beauty of young ladies, has commenced
&s;ince the above was written; and long may it continue!</P>

in London, at No. 6, North-&s;treet, Tottenham-court Road;
which &s;u&s;pends the head, and places the weight of it on the

<P>It will be from hence ea&s;ily perceived, that all other methods
of confining or directing the growth of young people &s;hould be
u&s;ed with great &s;kill, &s;uch as back-boards, or bandages; and that
their application &s;hould not be continued too long at a time; lea&s;t
wor&s;e con&s;equences &s;hould en&s;ue, than the deformity they are
de&s;igned to remove. Of the&s;e the &s;tocks for the feet of children,
for the purpo&s;e of making them turn their toes quite out, and
<PB N="79" REF="78">
the frame for pre&s;&s;ing in their knees, as they &s;tand erect, at the
&s;ame time, I &s;u&s;pect, when carried to exce&s;s, to be particularly
injurious, and to have cau&s;ed an irrecoverable lamene&s;s of the
hip-joint; as explain'd in Zoonomia, vol. II. cla&s;s 1. 2. 2. 17.
The&s;e therefore &s;hould be u&s;ed with proper caution, &s;o as to give
no pain or unea&s;y feels, or not u&s;ed at all.</P>
<P>To this it may be proper to add, that the &s;tiff erect attitude,
taught by &s;ome modern dancing ma&s;ters, does not contribute to
the grace of per&s;on, but rather militates again&s;t it; as is well
&s;een in one of the prints in Hogarth's analy&s;is of beauty; and is
exemplify'd by the ea&s;y grace of &s;ome of the antient &s;tatues, as
of the Venus de Medici, and the Antinous; and in the works of
&s;ome modern arti&s;ts, as in a beautiful print of Hebe feeding an
eagle, painted by Hamilton, and engraved by Eginton; and many
of the figures of Angelica Kauffman. And la&s;tly, which is &s;o
eminently &s;een in many of the beauties of the pre&s;ent day, &s;ince
they have left off the con&s;traint of whale-bone &s;tays, and a&s;&s;umed
the graceful dre&s;s of the ancient grecian &s;tatues.</P>
<P>In the tendency to curviture of the &s;pine whatever &s;trengthens
the general con&s;titution is of &s;ervice, as the u&s;e of the cold bath
in the &s;ummer months. This however requires &s;ome re&s;triction
<PB N="80" REF="79">
both in re&s;pect to the degree of coldne&s;s of the bath, the time of
continuing in it, and the &s;ea&s;on of the year. Common &s;prings,
which are of 48 degrees of heat, are too cold for tender con&s;ti|tutions,
whether of children or adults; and frequently do them
great and irreparable injury, as I have witne&s;&s;ed in three or four
ca&s;es. The coldne&s;s of river water in the &s;ummer months,
which is about 65 degrees, or that of Matlock, which is about
68, or of Buxton, which is 82, are much to be prefer'd: The
two latter are improperly call'd warm baths, comparing their
degree of heat with that of common &s;prings; whereas they are in
reality cold baths, being of much lower degree of heat than that
of the human body, which is 98. The time of continuing in a
cold bath &s;hould be but a few minutes; certainly not &s;o long as
to occa&s;ion a trembling of the limbs from cold. In re&s;pect to
the &s;ea&s;on of the year, delicate children &s;hould certainly only
u&s;e cold bathings in the &s;ummer months; as the going fre|quently
into the cold air in winter will an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es
of the cold bath.</P>

<P>YOUNG Ladies &s;hould be in&s;tructed to &s;hew attention to
their dre&s;s, as it gives an idea of cleanline&s;s of their per&s;ons;
which has &s;o great a charm, that it may be reckon'd among&s;t the
inferior virtues; for this purpo&s;e an elegant &s;implicity of dre&s;s is
to be recommended in preference to that &s;uperabundance of orna|ment,
where the lady her&s;elf is the lea&s;t part of her. The form
of dre&s;s mu&s;t neverthele&s;s perpetually vary with the fa&s;hion of the
time; but a per&s;on of ta&s;te may le&s;&s;en tho&s;e parts of a fa&s;hionable
dre&s;s, which oppo&s;e beauty or grace; and bring forwards tho&s;e,
which are more coincident with them; &s;o as to wear a dre&s;s in
fa&s;hion, and yet not devoid of ta&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="81">
Thus when large hoops were in general u&s;e, which &s;o totally
militate with all ideas of beauty and grace; ladies of ta&s;te wore
them as &s;mall, as cu&s;tom would allow. So in re&s;pect to the
ear-rings of the pre&s;ent day; &s;ince piercing the tender part of the
ear for the purpo&s;e of &s;u&s;pending a weight of gold, or of precious
&s;tones, or of gla&s;s beads to it, reminds us of the &s;avage &s;tate of
mankind; tho&s;e ladies of ta&s;te, who think them&s;elves obliged to
comply with this indecorous fa&s;hion, u&s;e the lighte&s;t materials, as
a chain of &s;mall pearls, to give a le&s;s di&s;tressing idea of the pain,
they &s;eem to &s;uffer at every motion of their heads. Hence al&s;o
long pendant and complicated ear-rings, however they may add
to the dignity of riper years by their co&s;tline&s;s, are unbecoming to
young ladies; as they &s;eem to give pain in the quicker, tho' more
graceful, motions of juvenility.</P>
<P>Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, I think, ob&s;erves in one of his addre&s;&s;es
to the academy, that hard curls of hair &s;tiffen'd with the fat of
hogs, and cover'd with the flower of wheat, cannot be admitted
into picture. The &s;ame may be observed of that coat of mail, the
whale-bone &s;tays, the u&s;e of which is now &s;o happily di&s;conti|nued.
Both of the&s;e, however they may conceal the grey hairs
and waining figures of tho&s;e, who are advanced in life, are highly
injurious to the flowing locks and graceful forms of young ladies.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="82">
As beauty con&s;i&s;ts of lines flowing in ea&s;y curves according to
the analy&s;is of Hogarth; tho&s;e parts of dre&s;s, which are com|po&s;ed
of &s;uch lines, are always agreeable. Thus a &s;a&s;h de&s;cend|ing
from one &s;houlder to the oppo&s;ite hip, or a grecian veil
thrown back and winding carele&s;sly down behind, are always
beautiful; but a few white o&s;trich feathers ri&s;ing on the head
before, and a train of &s;ilk &s;weeping on the ground behind, add &s;o
much grace to a moving female figure, as to attract all eyes with
uncea&s;ing admiration.</P>
<P>In moving forwards the hair falls back, and in very &s;wift
motion floats upon the air behind; hence by a&s;&s;ociation of ideas,
when the hair is made to retire from the cheeks, it gives an inti|mation
of the youthful agility of the per&s;on; and when it is
brought forwards over the cheeks, it may con&s;ent with unmoving
dignity, like the full wig of a judge, but dimini&s;hes our idea of
the activity of playful youth.</P>
<P>Where the appearance of u&s;e in dre&s;s can be given to orna|ments,
it &s;ugge&s;ts an excu&s;e for wearing them, and is therefore
to be prefer'd; as diamond pins, &s;trings of pearl, and a comb of
&s;hell, to re&s;train the exuberant hair; or knots of ribbons to fix the
&s;lipper on the foot, to contract the &s;leeve around the arm, to unite
<PB N="84" REF="83">
the ve&s;t upon the bo&s;om, or to attach the cap above the forehead.
And when the&s;e are &s;imilar in colour, it gives an air of &s;implicity,
and a kind of pyramidal form to the dre&s;s; which the painters &s;o
much endeavour to exhibit both in their land&s;capes, and their
groups of figures.</P>
<P>Other ornaments, which bear no analogy to u&s;e in dre&s;s,
&s;hould be &s;paringly worn; lea&s;t they give an idea, that they were
de&s;ign'd to di&s;play the pride of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, rather than to deco|rate
her per&s;on. The&s;e are &s;ometimes &s;een &s;o ill placed as to
make deformities con&s;picuous, as a number of rings on fingers
di&s;torted with the gout, or &s;plendid buckles on turn'd-in feet.
Where there is no appearance of u&s;e, all &s;hining ornaments &s;hould
be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to direct the eye of the beholder to &s;ome beau|tiful
feature of the lady, who wears them; as diamond &s;tars in
the hair, and artificial flowers on the bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Paint and per&s;umes are totally inadmi&s;&s;ible in the dre&s;s of
young ladies, as they give a &s;u&s;picion of natural defects in re&s;pect
to colour of the &s;kin, and odour of the breath. Where there
exi&s;ts but a mediocrity of beauty, and youth is in the wain, a
variety of pretty or of co&s;tly ornaments on the dre&s;s, and even
he whitene&s;s of powder in the hair, may &s;ometimes mingle with
<PB N="85" REF="84">
our idea of the per&s;on, and &s;eem to render the whole fairer, more
plea&s;ing, or more re&s;pectable. But ornaments of every kind are
u&s;ele&s;s or injurious to youthful beauty; they add no power to
the charm, but rather di&s;enchant the beholder by ab&s;tracting his
attention; which dwells with undimini&s;h'd rapture on beauty
array'd by &s;implicity, and animated without affectation. Thus
the maje&s;tic Juno of Homer is array'd in variety of ornament,
and with ear-rings, which have three large pendant bobs to each,
and commands univer&s;al homage. But his Queen of Beauty is
dre&s;s'd with more &s;imple elegance, in her magic &s;a&s;h, or ce&s;tus,
and charms all eyes.</P>
<P>The attention to ta&s;te in dre&s;s may neverthele&s;s be carried into
an extreme; it &s;hould not &s;eem to be the mo&s;t important part of
the education of a young lady; or the principal object of her care;
&s;he &s;hould rather appear to follow than to lead the fa&s;hion, ac|cording
to the lines of Mr. Pope,
<Q><L>Be not the fir&s;t, on which the new are tried,</L>
<L>Nor yet the la&s;t to lay the old a&s;ide.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PUNISHMENTS. REWARDS. MOTIVES.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the cu&s;tom of many &s;chools to u&s;e &s;ome kinds of puni&s;h|ments,
which either give pain or di&s;grace to the delinquent, as a
fool's cap, or a meal of water gruel. The u&s;e of the&s;e are &s;eldom
if ever nece&s;&s;ary in &s;chools for young ladies, and are always at|tended
with di&s;agreeable con&s;equences, as they either dimini&s;h the
character of honour in the puni&s;h'd per&s;ons, &s;ink their &s;pirits, or
render them in&s;en&s;ible to the opinions of others; or injure their
health: In&s;omuch that at &s;ome &s;chools all that can be acquired
<PB N="88" REF="87">
can &s;carcely compen&s;ate the lo&s;s of cheerfulne&s;s, and degradation
of mind, or bad health, which their puni&s;hments produce.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;itting in the public &s;chool for an hour in a cap with
bells dimini&s;hes the &s;en&s;ibility of a child to the opinions of her
companions, and thus gradually de&s;troys one of the greate&s;t mo|tives
to good actions, and of the greate&s;t re&s;traints from bad ones.
For the &s;ame rea&s;on reprimands and even admonitions &s;hould be
always applied in private, but applau&s;e or reward in public.</P>
<P>A meal of water gruel, given as a puni&s;hment in&s;tead of a
meal of animal food, &s;o frequently had recour&s;e to in &s;ome
boarding &s;chools, I believe to have laid the foundation of incurable
debility. The di&s;ea&s;es of debility, as &s;crophula, bronchocele,
&s;oftne&s;s of bones, and the con&s;equent di&s;tortion of them, are very
common among the children of the poor in Derby, which on
examination, I believe to be owing to their food con&s;i&s;ting chiefly
of gruel; or &s;ometimes with milk, which has been twice &s;kim'd,
&s;o that it is totally deprived of it's mo&s;t nouri&s;hing part; at other
times with weak &s;alt broth, but &s;eldom with &s;olid animal food.
When broth is weak in re&s;pect to the quantity of fle&s;hmeat boil'd
in it, it is the cu&s;tom of cooks to add much &s;alt to it to increa&s;e
the reli&s;h, which renders it &s;till more injurious to weak children;
<PB N="89" REF="88">
as &s;alt contains no nouri&s;hment, and by its &s;timulus increa&s;es the
action of the &s;y&s;tem; and by promoting great in&s;en&s;ible or &s;en&s;i|ble
per&s;piration dimini&s;hes the &s;trength of the child more, than
the &s;mall quantity of meat di&s;&s;olved in the broth can counter|balance.</P>
<P>2. How then are refractory children to be govern'd? certainly
by the &s;uperiority of the mind of the teacher over that of the
pupil. When a famous lady in Italy was put to the torture, and
que&s;tion'd by what &s;orcery &s;he had govern'd a prince&s;s of the fa|mily
of Medici; &s;he an&s;wered &startq;by no &s;orcery, but by that
power, which &s;uperior minds po&s;&s;e&s;s over inferior ones.&endq;</P>
<P>3. Be&s;ides the two circum&s;tances, which &s;o much govern the
great world, I mean hope of reward and fear of puni&s;hment; in
the micro&s;co&s;m of a boarding &s;chool blame and prai&s;e, if given
very &s;paringly, will be found &s;trong motives to the little pupils
to perform their ta&s;ks well, and of more efficacy ten times, than
the meal of water gruel, or the di&s;grace of a cap and bells.
E&s;teem and di&s;grace are ob&s;erved by Mr. Locke to be of all
others the mo&s;t powerful incentives to the mind, when once it is
brought to regard them: And if once you can communicate to
children a love of credit, and an apprehen&s;ion of &s;hame, you have
<PB N="90" REF="89">
in&s;till'd into them a principle, which will con&s;tantly act, and in|cline
them to do right, tho' it is not the true &s;ource from whence
our actions ought to &s;pring; which &s;hould be from our duty to
others and to our&s;elves.&mdash;See E&s;&s;ay on education; &s;ect. 56, &amp;c.
where are many other valuable ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>4. Emulation at &s;eeing others excel, if properly managed is
another incitement to indu&s;try. But as this is liable to degenerate
into envy, it &s;hould rather be left to it's own operation, than be
promoted by pointing out the examples, which &s;hould be copied.
It is better to &s;ay, &startq;your ta&s;k is not done to-day &s;o well as you
&s;ometimes do it,&endq; than to &s;ay, &startq;your ta&s;k is not done &s;o well as
your &s;i&s;ter's.&endq; Since in the latter ca&s;e envy, and it's con&s;equence
hatred, may &s;ucceed; a thing of tenfold wor&s;e con&s;equence than
the neglect of a thou&s;and ta&s;ks.</P>
<P>5. Tho' &s;ome degree of flattery may be u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in
teaching veracity to very young children, as mention'd in &s;ect.
18. of this work, yet I think it &s;hould be u&s;ed very rarely indeed,
and only on very important occa&s;ions, lea&s;t it &s;hould become a
nece&s;&s;ary motive of action, in&s;tead of moral duty; as ob&s;erved in
Zoonomia, vol. II. cla&s;s iii. 2. 1. 8. &startq;The debility of the ex|ertion
of voluntary efforts prevents the accompli&s;hment of all the
<PB N="91" REF="90">
great purpo&s;es of life. This often originates from a mi&s;taken
education; in which plea&s;ure or vanity is made the immediate
motive of action, and not future advantage, or what is term'd
duty. This ob&s;ervation is of great value to tho&s;e, who attend
to the early education of their own children.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have &s;een one or two young married ladies of fortune, who
perpetually became unea&s;y, and believed them&s;elves ill, a week
after their arrival in the country; and continued &s;o uniformly
during their &s;tay; yet on their return to London or to Bath im|mediately
lo&s;t all their complaints; and this I ob&s;erved to happen
to them repeatedly. All which I was led to a&s;cribe to their being
in their infancy &s;urrounded with menial attendants, who had flat|tered
them into the exertions, which they then u&s;ed. And that
in their mature years they became torpid for the want of this &s;ti|mulus,
and could not amu&s;e them&s;elves by any voluntary em|ployment,
but required ever after to be flattered into activity; or
to be amu&s;ed by others.&endq;</P>
<P>6. Rewards have been given to children to excite their indu&s;|try
in the performance of particular ta&s;ks; the&s;e are certainly le&s;s
eligible motives to action than the fear of di&s;grace, the love of
reputation, and above all the obligations of duty. Where never|thele&s;s
<PB N="92" REF="91">
the&s;e are thought proper, the kind of rewards requires
&s;ome attention; which &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of books, or maps, or
boxes of colours, or needle ca&s;es; but not of money, or of trinkets
for ornamental dre&s;s, or of a gla&s;s of wine. Where money is
given as a reward for indu&s;try in children, it may &s;eem to them
to be the proper motive of their actions in&s;tead of reputation or
of duty; and may thus induce the vice of avarice or of extrava|gance.
Where a fine cap or gown is given as a reward of dili|gence,
the pride of dre&s;s may be produced, and become their
great motive of action, in&s;tead of the love of reputation, or of
duty. And la&s;tly, where a gla&s;s of wine is given as a reward for
indu&s;try, a child is taught to believe wine to be a mo&s;t valuable
acqui&s;ition, and a perpetual de&s;ire of it even to intoxication may
be the con&s;equence. I remember a wealthy farmer, who had
two drunken &s;ons, tho' he was a &s;ober man him&s;elf, who told
me, that he a&s;cribed this great misfortune to his having occa&s;ion|ally
given them in their early life a cup of ale as a reward for
their exertions.&mdash;See Locke on education, &s;ect. 52, &amp;c.</P>
<P>7. A very accurate ob&s;erver, who has long had the conduct
of &s;chools of various kinds for the in&s;truction of the youth of
both &s;exes, acquaints me, &startq;That he has often with extreme
&s;urprize ob&s;erved a child make a greater progre&s;s in &s;ome one
<PB N="93" REF="92">
branch of education in three months, than another of &s;imilar
age, opportunity, capacity, and even apparently of equal applica|tion,
has been able to effect in three years.&endq; The &s;ame ob&s;erva|tion
has been made by others, but he adds, &startq;That this might
probably ari&s;e from &s;ome trivial circum&s;tance, which determined
the inclination of the fortunate &s;tudent; and that it is po&s;&s;ible,
that the means may &s;ometime be di&s;cover'd of governing the&s;e
incidents, and thus producing a new, era in the art of education!&endq;</P>
<P>Similar to this it has often been ob&s;erved, that the fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ions
made on our infant minds by accidental di&s;gu&s;t, admiration,
or flattery, are the frequent cau&s;es of our antipathies or aver&s;ions,
and continue through life to bias our affections or mi&s;lead our
judgments. One of my acquaintance can trace the origin of many of
his own energies of action from &s;ome &s;uch remote
&s;ources; which ju&s;tifies the ob&s;ervation of M. Rou&s;&s;eau, that the
&s;eeds of future virtues or vices are oftener &s;own by the mother

<P>Many children from the difficulty of &s;peaking it are liable to a
defective pronunciation of the letter R; this is indeed almo&s;t ge|neral
in &s;ome parts of Northumberland, and is &s;aid to be a &s;ound
unknown in China; which obliged the catholic mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;ent
thither by Louis the 14th to change the name of the virgin Mary,
from Maria into Malia, or from Mary into Mally. In &s;peaking
the letter R the middle of the tongue is made to vibrate with
&s;emivocal air; whereas in pronouncing L, the edges of the
tongue only vibrate; the Northumberland vernacular R is form'd
with &s;ibilant air in&s;tead of &s;emivocal air, or differs from the true
R, as S differs from Z. Both which &s;hould be explain'd to tho&s;e
children, who have this imperfect pronunciation.</P>
<P>Among the lower orders of the people of London, who are
called Cockneys, the letter W is pronounced &s;ibilant like the
German W, and not &s;emivocal like our vernacular one; this
&s;eems to re&s;emble the &s;ound of V to inattentive ears; and the&s;e
Cockneys, are thence &s;uppo&s;ed to u&s;e V in&s;tead of W, as Vomen

when alone, as in repeating a play; but begins to he&s;itate, if any

Tho&s;e words al&s;o are mo&s;t difficult to him to pronounce, which he

more &s;o if he is aware, that the hearer is impatient to be inform'd,
and that he cannot conjecture the name, before it is &s;poken.</P>
<P>It requires great attention, and much time to overcome this

<P>Suppo&s;e the &s;tammerer finds difficulty in &s;peaking the word

<P>THIS defect of vi&s;ion, which is term'd &s;trabi&s;mns, may fre|quently
be conquer'd in children, if it be attended to early, be|fore
it has been long e&s;tabli&s;h'd by habit. In this deformity it
generally happens, that one eye is better than the other, which
induces the child to view objects with the be&s;t eye, and to hide
the center of the other behind the no&s;e. This greater inirritabi|lity
of one eye is often occa&s;ion'd, I &s;u&s;pect, in infancy, by tying
a bandage for too long a time over an eye, which has happen'd
to be &s;lightly inflamed, and thus decrea&s;ing it's power of action
<PB N="99" REF="98">
by di&s;u&s;e; in the &s;ame manner the large mu&s;cles of the body
become weaken'd by long inaction; and the right arm is generally
&s;tronger than the left from it's having been more frequently ex|erci&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e if the be&s;t eye be for an hour or two, or longer,
cover'd every day with gauze &s;tretch'd upon a circular piece of
whale-bone, &s;o as to render the vi&s;ion of this eye as
indi&s;tinct as that of the other, the child will naturally turn them both to the
&s;ame object, and in a little time the weak eye will become
&s;tronger by being u&s;ed, or the &s;trong one weaker by di&s;u&s;e, and
the child will cea&s;e to &s;quint.</P>
<P>Another kind of &s;quinting is owing intirely to a bad habit, and
con&s;i&s;ts in looking at objects with one eye only at a time. The
owl bends both his eyes upon the object, which he ob&s;erves; and
by thus perpetually turning his head to the thing he in&s;pects, ap|pears
to have greater attention to it; and has thence acquired the
name of the bird of wi&s;dom. All other birds, I believe, look at
objects with one eye only, but it is with the eye neare&s;t the ob|ject
attended to; whereas in this kind of &s;trabi&s;mns the per&s;on
attends to objects with the mo&s;t di&s;tant eye only. This habit
has probably been produced, by a cap worn in infancy, which
<PB N="100" REF="99">
projected forward beyond the head on each &s;ide, like the bluffs
of a coach-hor&s;e, &s;o as to make it easier for the child, as he lay in
his cradle, to view oblique objects with the eye mo&s;t di&s;tant from
them; which kind of cap is therefore to be avoided.</P>
<P>A curious ca&s;e of this ill habit of vi&s;ion is related in the Philo&s;.
Tran&s;act. vol. 68. by Dr. Darwin; which was relieved by fixing
a parchment gnomon on the no&s;e of the little boy; which pro|jected
about an inch from the ridge of it, and cau&s;ed him for a
time to view oblique objects with that eye, which was neare&s;t
them.</P>

<P>Nothing prevents or cures the&s;e maladies but a due attention
to keep the extremities of delicate children warm, either by

linen rag moi&s;tened in a &s;aturnine &s;olution made by di&s;&s;olving half

<P>THE rheumati&s;m, and other inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, are fre|quently
occa&s;ion'd in crowded &s;chools by placing &s;ome of the
beds with one &s;ide again&s;t a wall; where the weaker child con|fined
by a &s;tronger bedfellow is liable to lie for hours together
with &s;ome part of it in contact with the cold wall; which in the
winter months has often been attended with fatal con&s;equences;
and e&s;pecially in tho&s;e boarding &s;chools, where the beds are
&s;mall, and but one blanket allow'd to each of them, and a &s;canty
feather-bed.</P>
<P>We are indued with a very accurate &s;en&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h heat
and cold, which &s;hould be nicely attended to; as the extremes of
<PB N="104" REF="103">
both of them are injurious to our health, and more &s;o in our
&s;leeping than in our waking hours. The extreme of heat is not
much experienced in this climate, except when it is artificially
produced; but that of cold is the cau&s;e of numerous di&s;ea&s;es of
the mo&s;t fatal tendency. A &s;evere continued fro&s;t may be borne
by the &s;trong, who can keep them&s;elves warm by their activity,
but is de&s;tructive to the weak and &s;edentary. In the year 1795
the weather in January, and in one week of February was un|commonly
&s;evere; the &s;ame five weeks in January and February
1796 were uncommonly mild; and it appears by the bills of
mortality in London, that 2823 people died in the&s;e five weeks
of fro&s;t in 1795; and that only 1471 died in the &s;ame five weeks
of mild weather in 1796, which is not much more than half the
number.&mdash;See a paper by Dr. Heberden in Philo&s;. Tran&s;act. For
the year 1796.</P>
<P>Some mi&s;inform'd parents have conceived, that a hard bed con|tributes
to harden their children in re&s;pect to their bearing cold,
and have on that account laid them on &s;traw-mattre&s;&s;es, or on beds
with boarded bottoms. The only difference between lying on a
&s;oft or hard bed con&s;i&s;ts in this; the weight of the body in the
former ca&s;e pre&s;&s;es on a larger &s;urface, and in the latter on a le&s;s;
neither of which has any reference to the habits of tenderne&s;s or
<PB N="105" REF="104">
hardine&s;s in re&s;pect to cold and heat; unle&s;s indeed a feather-bed
is &s;o &s;oft, that, as the child &s;inks down in the middle of it, the
ri&s;ing edges bend over him, and in part cover him. Perhaps
beds made of &s;oft leather properly prepared, and inflated with
air, as the Emperor of Germany was &s;aid to u&s;e in camp, might
be preferable on this account to feather-beds.</P>
<P>The beds for young children cannot therefore be too &s;oft,
however they may contribute to the indolence of grown people,
provided they do not keep them too warm by bending over them
as above de&s;cribed. But the too great hardne&s;s of beds is, I believe,
frequently injurious to the &s;hape of infants by occa&s;ioning them
to re&s;t on too few parts at a time; which hardens tho&s;e parts by
pre&s;&s;ure, and prevents their proportionate growth. It al&s;o occa|&s;ions
their &s;leep to be le&s;s &s;ound by the unea&s;ine&s;s it cau&s;es, and
in con&s;equence le&s;s refre&s;hing.</P>
<P>The feet and knees and hands of weaker children are liable to
become cold in bed in winter, on which account it is more &s;alu|tary
for them to &s;leep with a bed-fellow, rather than alone; as
they then naturally put their cold knees or hands to their compa|nion
in bed, and thus frequently prevent rheumatic, and other
inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es of fatal event. For the &s;ame rea&s;on it is
<PB N="106" REF="105">
better for a new-born infant to &s;leep with it's mother in winter,
or with a young nur&s;e, than in a &s;olitary crib by her bed-&s;ide;
unle&s;s the artificial warmth of the room be more nicely graduated,
than is commonly done.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, where children are too feeble from illne&s;s,
a fire &s;hould be allow'd in their bed-chamber in cold weather; as
the cold air is otherwi&s;e injurious to their lungs, which cannot be
clothed &s;o as to prevent the contact of the air, like the other parts
of the body; a fire contributes al&s;o to ventilate a room, and to
circulate the air in it, and thence to render it more &s;alutary; but
it &s;hould not warm it to more than 60 or 65 degrees, that it's
temperature may not differ too much from that of the external
atmo&s;phere; as tho&s;e, who are kept generally too warm, are liable
to take cold at every bla&s;t of air, not from the degree of cold, to
which they happen to be expo&s;ed, but to it's difference from that,
which they have been accu&s;tomed to.&mdash;See &s;ect. xxvi.</P>
<P>The univer&s;al analogy derived from other animals, which pro|duce
a feeble offspring, evinces the truth of this doctrine, both
in re&s;pect to the &s;oftne&s;s, and the due degree of warmth of their
beds: Birds line the ne&s;ts for their young with feathers; the
cider duck, and the rabbit, pluck the down from their own
<PB N="107" REF="106">
brea&s;ts to increa&s;e the &s;oftne&s;s of the beds for their tender off-&s;pring;
and brood them with their wings, or cla&s;p them to their
bo&s;oms for the &s;ake of warmth.</P>
<P>The number of hours required for &s;alutary &s;leep is greater for
younger children, than for tho&s;e more advanced; as during our
progre&s;s through life we acquire greater facility in u&s;ing our vo|luntary
power, and recruit it in le&s;s time when exhau&s;ted. The
younger cla&s;&s;es of &s;cholars may go to re&s;t at &s;even, or eight; but
the elder &s;hould be allowed another hour for the purpo&s;es of read|ing
or other kinds of improvement; the hour of ri&s;ing mu&s;t vary

<P>MILK is the food de&s;igned by nature for young animals, and
&s;hould be given them in it's recent &s;tate. As the cream is the
mo&s;t nouri&s;hing part of the milk, and is ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion than
the coagulable or chee&s;y part; and as milk con&s;titutes a principal
<PB N="108" REF="107">
portion of the aliment of children; to take off the cream once,
or even twice, as is practi&s;ed in &s;ome boarding &s;chools, before it
is given to the children, is a &s;hameful circum&s;tance of par&s;imony,
and very injurious to their healths.&mdash;See &s;ect. xxx, on puni&s;h|ments.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould the milk given to children be long kept in a boil|ing
heat; becau&s;e much of it's fragrant oil is then evaporated, as
is evident from the fine odour of the &s;team of it, when taken
from the fire; and it's further deterioration from long boiling is
&s;hewn by it's then inducing con&s;tipation, which is contrary to
it's effect in it's recent and natural &s;tate.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s even new milk does not always agree with chil|dren,
after they have pa&s;s'd the years of infancy. For milk taken
into the &s;tomach mu&s;t be always previou&s;ly curdled or coagulated,
before it can be dige&s;ted, or converted into nouri&s;hment: Hence
milk is always found curdled in the &s;tomachs of calves, and the
acid juice of their &s;tomachs is u&s;ed to coagulate the milk in the
proce&s;s of chee&s;e-making: Now the &s;tomachs of young children
abound more with this acid juice than in their riper years, and
when a &s;ufficient quantity of it is not produced for the purpo&s;e
of curdling the milk, which they drink, it is liable to di&s;agree.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="108">
To the&s;e few therefore, who&s;e &s;tomachs do hot ea&s;ily dige&s;t
the coagulable part of milk, other fluid food &s;hould he allow'd to
breakfa&s;t, as gruel, or tea with cream and &s;ugar in it, and with
bread and butter; and to &s;upper, a &s;lice of cold meat, or of chee&s;e,
or tart, or bread and butter, with &s;mall beer or water for drink;
but it is probable, that milk might be made to agree with all
&s;tomachs, if it was previou&s;ly curdled by rennet, as I have often
recommended with &s;ucce&s;s to elderly per&s;ons; or by letting it
&s;tand, till it becomes &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;our like buttermilk, as is the
cu&s;tom of the inferior people of Scotland; except neverthele&s;s
where the di&s;ta&s;te of the child is owing to prejudice or caprice,
which is then incurable but by time.</P>
<P>For dinner animal food plain dre&s;s'd, with vegetables or bread,
and pudding of wheat flour, milk, and eggs, with &s;ugar or but|ter,
are more nouri&s;hing than vegetable &s;u&s;tenance alone. Wheat
flour contains more nutriment than that of rice, or barley, or oats;
as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more &s;tarch in proportion to it's bulk, and a gluten
approaching to animal matter. But much &s;alt or &s;pice &s;hould not
be allow'd in the diet of children, as they are certainly unwhole|&s;ome
by inducing a weakne&s;s of the capillary and ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;|tems
of ve&s;&s;els in con&s;equence of their too great &s;timulus, and
contain no nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="109">
As butter and &s;ugar are perhaps the mo&s;t nutritive of animal
and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, they may be more ea&s;ily taken to ex|ce&s;s;
on which account &s;ome mi&s;taken parents have totally pro|habited
the u&s;e of them; which is a great di&s;advantage to weaker
children, who require more nutritive diet in le&s;s bulk than
&s;tronger ones.</P>
<P>For the drink of the more robu&s;t children water is preferable,
and for the weaker ones, &s;mall beer; but in this, as well as in
the choice of &s;olid food, their palates &s;hould be con&s;ulted; for the
nice di&s;cernment of this &s;en&s;e is be&s;tow'd on us by nature to di&s;|tingui&s;h,
what the &s;tomach can be&s;t dige&s;t. It &s;hould however
be ob&s;erved, that in artificial viands the ta&s;te cannot di&s;tingui&s;h,
what is unwhole&s;ome; as &s;ugar may be mix'd with ar&s;enic. So
in the drinking of fermented liquors, as ale or wine, which are
chemical productions, the palate is not to be con&s;ulted; a gla&s;s
of meer wine &s;hould never be given to children, as it injures their
tender &s;tomachs like a gla&s;s of brandy or rum or gin to a grown
per&s;on; and induces tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, which it is often erroneou&s;ly
given to prevent; as weakne&s;s of dige&s;tion, with the production
of worms in con&s;equence. Wine neverthele&s;s diluted with thrice
it's quantity of water may be allow'd, if required, in&s;tead of &s;mall
beer; or ale or cider diluted with thrice their quantities of water.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="110">
Ripe fruits, or fruit pies, are peculiarly &s;erviceable to the con|&s;titutions
of children, as well as agreeable to their palates; as they
are known to prevent biliary concretions, and con&s;equent jaun|dice;
and on the &s;ame account to render the &s;kin clearer and
fairer, as well as to counteract the tendency to putrid di&s;ea&s;es.
The&s;e &s;hould therefore be allow'd to children at all &s;ea&s;ons; and
may either occa&s;ionally con&s;titute a part of their diet; or may be
recommended to them, when they lay out part of their pocket-money
with huck&s;ters, in preference to &s;eed-cakes, gingerbread,
or &s;ugar-plumbs; the former of which are generally made of bad
flour deteriorated by &s;pice; and the latter are liable to be colour'd
with gamboge, vermillion, verdigrea&s;e, or other noxious drugs.</P>
<P>Too long fa&s;ting, or food of le&s;s nouri&s;hment than they have
been accu&s;tomed to, are peculiarly injurious to children; as they
weaken their power of dige&s;tion, impair their &s;trength, and im|pede
their growth. The children of the inferior poor, and of
families, which have adopted &s;ome ill-advi&s;ed rules of ab&s;temious
diet, are frequently &s;tarved into the &s;crophula, and become pale-faced
and bloated, owing to deficiency of the quantity of blood,
and to want of &s;ufficient &s;timulus to the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>If young people are thought to be too corpulent, a diminution

of food with an increa&s;e of exerci&s;e, when they have obtain'd
their full growth, may be u&s;ed with advantage; but even then
not without caution. Since young ladies, after they have left

become pale and emaciated, and to fall into universal debility;
which remains through a di&s;ea&s;ed and comfortle&s;s life.</P>

<P>1. A Due regard to the prudent expenditure of their money,
a proper care of their clothes, and a par&s;imonious attention to
the lap&s;e of time, &s;hould be inculcated into the minds of young
ladies. To effect the&s;e purpo&s;es one efficacious method, where
the u&s;ual exhortations fail, may be to &s;uffer their imprudence to
produce &s;ome inconvenience to them&s;elves; which they &s;hould
be permitted to feel to a proper degree.</P>
<P>Thus a profu&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary expenditure of their pocket money
will &s;hortly induce poverty; which &s;hould by no means be alle|viated
<PB N="113" REF="112">
by a fre&s;h &s;upply of money; till the inconvenience pro|duced
has effected a conviction of the impropriety of their con|duct.
Except when the expenditure has been made for &s;ome
laudable purpo&s;e, and then no time &s;hould be lo&s;t in re&s;toring the
power of repeating it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame means may be u&s;ed in re&s;pect to their omi&s;&s;ion to
take care of their clothes; they &s;hould find the nece&s;&s;ity of re|pairing
them with their own hands, or of foregoing &s;ome vi&s;it|ing
amu&s;ements, till new ones can be procured; that thus the
con&s;equent inconvenience may teach them economy, if they are
otherwi&s;e too inattentive to the u&s;ual admonitions on the&s;e &s;ub|jects.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the economy of time the hours of amu&s;ement and
of exerci&s;e &s;hould be regularly counted; and the length of time
young ladies employ in dre&s;&s;ing &s;hould be nicely attended to; as
in adult life the hours con&s;umed at the toilet of &s;ome ladies is
perfectly ridiculous, and detains them from more important
duties. Perhaps a &s;tated time might be allow'd the young ladies
for adju&s;ting the articles of their dre&s;s, that they might acquire
a habit of di&s;po&s;ing them with neatne&s;s, ta&s;te and elegance, and
yet with expedition.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="113">
2. Men are generally train'd from their early years to the
bu&s;ine&s;s or profe&s;&s;ion, in which they are afterwards to engage;
but it mo&s;t frequently happens to ladies, that tho' de&s;tined to the
&s;uperintendance of a future family, they receive &s;carcely any
previous in&s;truction; but begin this important office with a pro|found
ignorance of the value of money, and of the proper appli|cation
of the things, which surround them.</P>
<P>Many young ladies de&s;titute of mothers, and without a home,
are continued at &s;chool to a later age; &s;uch &s;hould be form'd into a
cla&s;s, and properly in&s;tructed in dome&s;tic economy; each of them
&s;uperintending the bu&s;ine&s;s of the family, a week or a month by
turns; not only providing for the table, and directing the cookery,
but they &s;hould al&s;o be taught other parts of dome&s;tic employ|ment,
as cutting out linens, and making them up with plain and
&s;trong needle-work, either for their own families, or to be given
as clothing for nece&s;&s;itous infants or mothers.</P>
<P>Such an addition of dome&s;tic knowledge and benevolent in|du&s;try
to ornamental accompli&s;hments would give the &s;chool,
that procures it, a decided advantage over other &s;chools, which
have no &s;uch in&s;titution.</P>

<HEAD>Section XXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">SCHOOL-EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE advantages of a &s;chool-education, where twenty or
thirty children are properly in&s;tructed, over that in a private fa|mily
are derived from &s;everal &s;ources. Fir&s;t, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved,
that almo&s;t all our exertions in early life are owing to our imi|tating
others; in childhood we are mo&s;t liable to imitate the
actions of tho&s;e, who are &s;omewhat older than our&s;elves; and in
manhood, of tho&s;e we are in &s;omewhat higher life; whence the
general prevalence of fa&s;hion in dre&s;s and manners. Now there
are more examples to cau&s;e this imitative activity in well con|ducted
&s;chools, and the children in con&s;equence become more
active in the pur&s;uit of their &s;tudies, and in the acquirement of
their accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>It may be added, that not only children, before they have acquired
the u&s;e of rea&s;on, or voluntary deliberation, but that the greate&s;t
part of adult mankind learn all the common arts of life by imi|tating
<PB N="116" REF="115">
others; and that even dumb creatures &s;eem capable of ac|quiring
knowledge with greater facility by imitating each other,
than by any methods, by which we can teach them. Thus dogs,
when they are &s;ick, learn of each other to eat gra&s;s as are emetic;
and cats to moi&s;ten their paws for the purpo&s;e of wa&s;hing their
faces. And the readie&s;t way to in&s;truct all brute animals is by
practi&s;ing them with others of the &s;ame &s;pecies; which have
already learnt the arts, we wi&s;h them to acquire, as explain'd in
Zoonomia, vol. I. &s;ect. 22. 3.</P>
<P>A &s;econd advantage of &s;chools, when well conducted, is, that
children often take plea&s;ure in teaching each other, in&s;omuch
that at boy's &s;chools I have often ob&s;erved, that the lower cla&s;&s;es
have learnt more from their &s;chool-fellows of the higher cla&s;&s;es,
than even from their ma&s;ters; which has &s;ometimes ari&s;en from
the friend&s;hip, or vanity of the elder boy, and &s;ometimes from the
&s;olicitation of the lower one; but has in all ca&s;es been advan|tageous
to both of them.</P>
<P>A third &s;uperiority of &s;chool-education ari&s;es from an emula|tion,
which naturally exi&s;ts, where many pur&s;ue the &s;ame &s;tudies,
but which &s;hould not be encouraged by rewards or degradations;
as it then may degenerate into envy or hatred; but &s;hould in ge|neral
<PB N="117" REF="116">
be left intirely to it's own operation; as mention'd in
&s;ect. xxx.</P>
<P>A fourth advantage of &s;chool-education is from the children
acquiring a kind of practical phy&s;iognomy; which renders them
more intelligent, and more intere&s;ting companions; and is of
greater con&s;equence in our pa&s;&s;age through life, than almo&s;t any
&s;ingle accompli&s;hment, as explain'd in &s;ect. vi. and &s;ect. xxiv. of
this work.</P>
<P>Fifthly, where languages are learnt by conver&s;ation, as is ge|nerally
practi&s;ed in teaching the french language, a &s;chool-edu|cation
properly conducted is much &s;uperior to that of a governe&s;s
in a private family. And languages are &s;o much ea&s;ier taught to
children by conver&s;ation than by the ab&s;tract rules of grammar,
that Mr. Locke is &s;olicitous to have the latin and greek languages
taught by conver&s;ation in boys' &s;chools; and thinks the time of
learning words might thus be much &s;horten'd, which now occu|pies
&s;even or eight years; part of which might be much better
employ'd in acquiring the knowledge of things.</P>
<P>The Philo&s;opher, who de&s;pi&s;ing the goods of fortune &s;aid,
&startq;he was rich, though he carried about with him every thing,
<PB N="118" REF="117">
which he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd,&endq; meant to a&s;&s;ert, that &s;trength of mind join'd
with &s;trength of body, were &s;uperior to any other advantages of
life. A good education furni&s;hes us with this ine&s;timable trea|&s;ure;
it accompanies us at home, travels with us abroad; delights
us in &s;olitude, graces us in &s;ociety; comforts us in mi&s;fortune,
guards us in pro&s;perity; contributes to the happine&s;s of others,
and en&s;ures our own.</P>

<P>I Beg leave to apprize the reader, that I have in&s;erted a great
part of the following catalogue of books for the younger chil|dren,
becau&s;e they were recommended to me by ladies, who&s;e
opinions I had rea&s;on to regard, and not from my own attentive
peru&s;al of them; which has been prevented by my other nece&s;|&s;ary
occupations. Such of them therefore, as are le&s;s generally
known, a parent or governe&s;s will plea&s;e to read, before they put
<PB N="119" REF="118">
them into the hands of their children. And I can only add, that
if I had my&s;elf been better acqainted, with them, the collection
would probably have been le&s;s numerous.</P>

<HEAD>APOLOGY FOR THE WORK.</HEAD>
<P>THE foregoing treati&s;e was written at the de&s;ire of Mi&s;s S. and Mi&s;s M. Parker;
who were them&s;elves educated for the purpo&s;e of educating others; and on that account
were originally placed in different &s;eminaries for female tuition; and afterwards en|gaged
them&s;elves for a time as teachers in other &s;chools, and in private families; the
better to qualify them&s;elves for the arduous ta&s;k of conducting a boarding &s;chool for
the education of young ladies.</P>
<P>About four years ago a hou&s;e was offered to &s;ale at A&s;hborne in Derby&s;hire, at the
very extremity of the town, in a mo&s;t plea&s;ant and healthy &s;ituation, on a dry &s;andy
&s;oil, with excellent water, well &s;helter'd from the north-ea&s;t, and commanding an
exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of Sir Brooke Boothby's park, and it's beautiful environs; through
which are plea&s;ant walks at all &s;ea&s;ons of the year; and of which an engraved plate
was pre&s;ented to me by Sir Brooke Boothby as a fronti&s;piece to this work.</P>
<P>A &s;pacious walled garden adjoins the hou&s;e at the bottom of which is a &s;tream of
water, winch may &s;ometime be converted into a river-bath.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s PARKERS procured this eligible &s;ituation, and had the hou&s;e well fitted up
for the purpo&s;es of a boarding &s;chool. It con&s;i&s;ts of an ample &s;chool-room, and an
ample dining-room, and four &s;maller parlours, on the principal floor; with two &s;tair-ca&s;es,
one of which is of &s;tone. The whole is airy and well lighted; and now con|tains
about thirty pupils without being crowded.</P>
<P>They next had the good fortune to engage very excellent teachers in dancing,
mu&s;ic, and drawing, from Nottingham, Derby, and Lichfield, with a polite emigrant
as French-ma&s;ter; and la&s;tly applied to me for any ideas, I could furni&s;h them with,
on the &s;ubject of female education. And now, as their e&s;tabli&s;hment has &s;ucceeded to
their utmo&s;t wi&s;h, have expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire, that I would give to the public, what I
wrote originally for their private in&s;pection.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that a copy of the manu&s;cript has been &s;een by many of the
ingenious of both &s;exes, and much improved by their ob&s;ervations; to whom I here
beg leave to return my mo&s;t grateful acknowledgments.</P>
