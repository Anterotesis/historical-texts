<P>The commanders of his maje&s;ty's forces and fleets in North-America and the We&s;t-Indies, have tran&s;mitted cer|tain and repeated intelli|gences, of an illegal and mo&s;t pernicious trade carried on by the king's &s;ubjects in North-America and the We&s;t-Indies, as well to the French i&s;lands as to the French &s;et|tlements on the continent in America&punc; and particularly to the rivers M bile and Mi&s;&s;i&s;|&s;$pp$; by which the $word$ to the great reproach and de|triment of government, are &s;upplied with provi&s;ions and other nece&s;&s;aries; whereby they are principally, if not alone, enabled to &s;u&s;tain and protract this long and expen|&s;ive war. And it further ap|pearing, that large &s;ums of bullion are &s;ent by the king's &s;ubjects to the above places, in return whereof commodi|ties are taken, which inter|fere with the product of the Briti&s;h colonies them&s;elves, in open contempt of the au|thority of the mother-coun|try, as well as the mo&s;t ma|nife&s;t prejudice of the manu|factures and trade of Great Britain. In order, therefore, to put the $o&s;t &s;peedy and $word$ $word$ &s;t$p to &s;uch flagiti|$$s $word$ &s;o utterly &s;ub|ver&s;ive of all laws, and &s;o highly repugnant to the well-being of this kingdom:</P>
<P>It is his maje&s;ty's expre&s;s will and plea&s;ure, that you do forthwith make the &s;trict$&s;t and mo&s;t diligent enquiry in|to the &s;tate of this dangerous and ignominious trade: and that you do u&s;e every means in your power to detect and di&s;cover per&s;ons concerned either as principals or acce&s;|&s;aries therein; and that you do take every &s;tep authorized by law, to bring all &s;uch hei|nous offenders to the mo&s;t ex|emplary and condign puni&s;h|ment. And you will as &s;oon as may be, and from time to time, tran&s;mit to me, for the king's information, full and particular accounts of the pro|gre&s;s you &s;hall have made in the execution of this his maje&s;ty's commands; to the which the king expects that you pay the mo&s;t exact obedience. And you are further to u&s;e your utmo&s;t endeavours to trace out and inve&s;tigate the various artifices and eva&s;ions by which the dealers in this iniquitous intercour&s;e find means to cover their criminal proceedings, and to elude the law; in order that from &s;uch lights due and timely con&s;i|derations may be had, what farther provi&s;ion may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to re&s;train an evil of &s;uch exten&s;ive and pernicious con&s;equences.</P>

of extraordinary profit excited the merchants<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760</NOTE> not only to a&s;&s;i&s;t the enemies of their country, but al&s;o to run all ri&s;ques in eluding the vigilance of the legi&s;lature. The inhabitants of Martinique found a plentiful market of provi&s;ion furni&s;hed by the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects at the Dutch i&s;lands of Eu&s;tatia and Cura&ccedil;oa; and tho&s;e that were &s;ettled on the i&s;land of Hi&s;pan$ola were &s;upplied in the &s;ame manner, at the Spani&s;h &s;ettlement of Monte-Chri&s;to.</P>

A&s;&s;emblies were held, and plans revolved for this purpo&s;e. At length they concerted a &s;cheme for ri&s;ing in arms all at once in different parts of the i&s;land, in order to ma&s;&s;acre all the white men, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the go|vernment. They agreed that this de&s;ign &s;hould be put in execution immediately after the depar|ture of the fleet for Europe: but their plan was defeated by their ignorance and impatience. Tho&s;e of the con&s;pirators that belonged to captain For|re&s;t's e&s;tate, being impelled by the fumes of in|toxication, fell &s;uddenly upon the over&s;eer while he &s;at at &s;upper with &s;ome friends, and butchered the whole company. Being immediately joined by &s;ome of their confederates, they attacked the neighbouring plantations, where they repeated the &s;ame barbarities, and &s;eizing all the arms and ammunition that fell in their way, began to grow formidable to the colony. The governor no &s;ooner received intimation of this di&s;turbance, than he, by proclamation, &s;ubjected the coloni&s;ts to martial law. All other bu&s;ine&s;s was interrupted, and every man took to his arms. The regular troops, joined by the troop of militia and a con|&s;iderable number of volunteers, marched from Spani&s;h Town to St. Mary's, where the in&s;urrec|tion began, and &s;kirmi&s;hed with the in&s;urgents; but as they declined &s;tanding any regular engage|ment,

The&s;e auxiliaries, in con&s;ide|ration of a price &s;et upon the heads of the rebels, attacked them in their own way, &s;lew them by &s;urprize, until their &s;trength was broken, and numbers made away with them&s;elves in de&s;pair; &s;o that the in&s;urrection was &s;uppo&s;ed to be quelled about the beginning of May: but in June it broke out again with redoubled fury, and the rebels were reinforced to a very con&s;iderable number. The regular troops and the militia, joined by a body of &s;ailors, formed a camp under the command of colonel Spragge, who &s;ent out detachments again&s;t the negroes, a good number of whom were killed and &s;ome taken; but the re&s;t, in&s;tead of &s;ubmit|ting, took &s;helter in the woods and mountains. The pri&s;oners being tried, and found guilty of rebellion, were put to death by a variety of tor|tures. Some were hanged; &s;ome beheaded; &s;ome burned; and &s;ome fixed alive upon gibbets. One of the&s;e la&s;t lived eight days and eighteen hours, &s;u&s;pended under a vertical &s;un, without being re|fre&s;hed by one drop of water, or receiving any manner of &s;u&s;tenance.</P>

Notwith|&s;tanding the&s;e examples and regulations, a body of rebellious negroes &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in places that were deemed inacce&s;&s;ible to regular forces, and from the&s;e they made nocturnal irruptions into the neare&s;t plantations, where they acted with all the wantonne&s;s of barbarity; &s;o that the people of Jamaica were obliged to conduct them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t vigilance and circum&s;pection; while rear-admiral Holmes, who commanded at &s;ea, took every precaution to &s;ecure the i&s;land from in|&s;ult or inva&s;ion.</P>

merchant-&s;hips to Europe, he &s;tationed the &s;hips<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> under his command, in &s;uch a manner as was mo&s;t likely to intercept this fleet; and his di&s;po&s;ition was attended with &s;ucce&s;s. The enemy &s;ailed from the cape to the number of eight &s;ail on the &s;ixteenth, and next day they were chaced by the king's &s;hips, the Hamp&s;hire, Lively, and Boreas, which, how|ever, made little progre&s;s, as there was little wind, and that variable. In the evening, the breeze fre&s;h|ened, and about midnight the Boreas came up with the Sirenne, commanded by commodore Mac-Cartie. They engaged with great vivacity for about twenty-five minutes, when the Sirenne &s;hot a-head, and made the be&s;t of her way. The Bo|reas was &s;o damaged in the rigging, that &s;he could not clo&s;e with the enemy again till next day at two in the afternoon, when the action was renewed off the ea&s;t end of Cuba, and maintained till forty minutes pa&s;t four, when Mr. Mac Cartie &s;truck. In the mean time, the Hamp&s;hire and Lively gave chace to the other four French frigates, which &s;teered to the &s;outhward with all the &s;ail they could carry, in order to reach the we&s;t-end of Tortuga, and &s;helter them&s;elves in Port au Prince. On the eighteenth the Lively, by the help of her oars, came up with the Valeur at half an hour pa&s;t &s;even in the morning; and after a hot action that con|tinued an hour and a half, compelled the enemy to &s;ubmit. The Hamp&s;hire &s;tood after the other three, and, about four in the afternoon, ran up be|tween the duke de Choi&s;euil and the prince Ed|ward. The&s;e he engaged at the &s;ame time; but the fir&s;t, having the advantage of the wind, made her retreat into Port au Paix: the other ran a-&s;hore about two leagues to leeward, and &s;truck her co|lours;

This was al&s;o the fate of the Fleur de Lis, which had run into Fre&s;h water-bay, a&punc;little farther to lee|ward of Port au Prince. Thus, by the prudent di&s;po&s;ition of admiral Holmes, and the gallantry of his three captains, Norbury, Uvedale, and Maitland, two large frigates of the enemy were taken, and three de&s;troyed.</P>

Two of the&s;e, namely the Vainqueur of ten guns, &s;ixteen &s;wivels, and ninety men, and the Mackau of &s;ix &s;wivels and fifteen men, had run into &s;hoal-water in Cumberland harbour, on the i&s;land of Cuba. The boats of the Trent and Boreas were manned, under the direction of the lieutenants, Millar and Stuart, who being rowed up to the Vainqueur, boarded and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion under a clo&s;e fire, after having &s;urmounted many other difficulties. The Mackau was taken, without any re&s;i&s;tance; then the boats proceeded again&s;t the Gue&s;pe of eight guns and eighty-five men, which lay at anchor far|ther up in the Lagoon; but before they came up, the enemy had &s;et her on fire, and &s;he was de&s;troyed.</P>

After a warm engagement, that la&s;ted &s;e|veral hours, the enemy's batteries were &s;ilenced, and indeed demoli&s;hed, and the Engli&s;h captains took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the four prizes. They after|wards entered another harbour of that i&s;land, hav|ing fir&s;t demoli&s;hed another fort; and there they lay four days unmole&s;ted, at the expiration of which they carried off three other prizes. In their return to Antigua, they fell in with thirteen &s;hips bound to Martinique with provi&s;ions, and took them all without re&s;i&s;tance. About the &s;ame time, eight or nine privateers were taken by the &s;hips which commodore Sir James Douglas employed in crui&s;ing round the i&s;land of Guadaloupe; &s;o that the Briti&s;h commerce in tho&s;e &s;eas flouri&s;hed under his care and protection.</P>

A powerful &s;qua|dron &s;till remained in the bay of Quiberon, in order to amu&s;e and employ a body of French forces on that part of the coa&s;t, and interrupt the navi|gation of the enemy; though the principal ai m of this armament &s;eems to have been to watch and detain the few French &s;hips, which had run into the river Villaine, after the defeat of Conflans; an object the importance of which will doubtle&s;s a&s;toni&s;h po&s;terity. The fleet employed on this &s;er|vice was alternately commanded by admiral Bo&s;|cawen and Sir Edward Hawke, officers of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed abilities, who&s;e talents might have been &s;urely rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to much greater na|tional advantages. All that Mr. Bo&s;cawen could do in this circum&s;cribed &s;cene of action was to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;mall i&s;land near the $iver Vannes, which he cau&s;ed to be cultivated and planted with vegetables for the u&s;e of the men infected with &s;corbutic di&s;orders ari&s;ing from &s;alt provi&s;ion, &s;ea air, and want of proper exerci&s;e. In the month of September, Sir Edward Hawke, who had by this time relieved Mr. Bo&s;cawen, detached the gallant lord Howe in the Magnanime, with the &s;hips prince Frederick and Bedford, to reduce the little i&s;land of Dumet, about three miles in length and two in breadth, abounding with fre&s;h water. It was defended by a &s;mall fort mounted with nine cannon, and manned with one company of the re|giment of Bourbon, who &s;urrendered in a very &s;hort time after the &s;hips had begun the attack. By this &s;mall conque&s;t a con&s;iderable expence was

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Admiral Rodney de&s;troys &s;ome ve&s;|&s;els on the c$a&s;t of France.</NOTE> Admiral Rodney &s;till maintained his former &s;ta|tion off the coa&s;t of Havre de Grace, to ob&s;erve what &s;hould pa&s;s at the mouth of the Seine. In the month of July, while he hovered in this neigh|bourhood, five large flat-botton$ed boats loaded wth cannon and &s;hot, &s;et &s;ail from Harfleur in the middle of the day, with their colours flying, as if they had &s;et the Engli&s;h &s;quadron at defiance; for the walls of Havre de Grace, and even the adja|cent hills were covered with &s;pectators, a&s;&s;embled to behold the i&s;&s;ue of this adventure. Having reached the river of Caen, they &s;tood backwards and forwards upon the &s;hoals, intending to amu&s;e Mr. Rodney till night, and then proceed under cover of the darkne&s;s. He perceived their drift, and gave directions to his &s;mall ve&s;&s;els to be ready, that as &s;oon as day-light failed, they &s;hould make all the &s;ail they could for the mouth of the river Orne, in order to cut off the enemy's retreat, while he him&s;elf &s;tood with the larger &s;hips to the &s;teep coa&s;t of Port Ba&s;&s;in. The &s;cheme &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h. The enemy, &s;eeing their retreat cut off, ran a&s;hore at Port Pa&s;&s;in, where the admiral de&s;troyed them, together with the &s;mall fort which had been erected for the defence of this harbour. Each of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els was one hundred feet in length, capable of containing four hundred men for a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age. What their de&s;tination was, we cannot pretend to determine: but the French had provided a great number of the&s;e tran&s;ports; for ten e&s;caped into the river Orne leading to Caen; and in con&s;equence of this di&s;a&s;ter one hundred

In the month of No|vember, captain Oury of the Acteon chaced a large privateer, and drove her on &s;hore between Cape Barfleur and La Hogue, where &s;he peri&s;hed. The cutters belonging to Mr. Rodney's &s;quadron &s;coured the coa&s;t towards Dieppe, where a con&s;ide|rable fi&s;hery was carried on, and where they took or de&s;troyed near forty ve&s;&s;els of con&s;iderable bur|then. Though the Engli&s;h navy &s;uffered nothing from the French during this period, it &s;u&s;tained &s;ome damage from the weather. The Conqueror, a new&s;hip of the line, was lo&s;t in the channel on the i&s;land of St. Nicholas; but the crew and cannon were &s;aved. The Lyme of twenty-guns foundered in the Cattegate in Norway, and fifty of the men peri&s;hed; and, in the We&s;t Indies, a tender belong|ing to the Dublin, commanded by commodore Sir James Douglas, was lo&s;t in a gale of wind, with an hundred cho&s;en mariners.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara|tions for a &s;ecret expedi|tion.</NOTE> Of the dome&s;tic tran&s;actions relating to the war, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable was the equipment of a pow|erful armament de&s;tined for &s;ome &s;ecret expedition. A numerous body of forces was a&s;&s;embled, and a great number of tran&s;ports collected at Port&s;|mouth. Generals were nominated to the com|mand of this enterprize. The troops were actu|ally embarked with a great train of artillery; and the eyes of the whole nation were attentively fixed upon this armament, which could not have been prepared without incurring a prodigious expence. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e preparations, the whole &s;ummer was &s;pent in idlene&s;s and inaction; and in
<PB N="15" REF="140">
the latter end of the &s;ea&s;on the undertaking was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760&punc;</NOTE> laid a&s;ide. The people did not fail to clamour again&s;t the inactivity of the &s;ummer, and com|plain, that notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e &s;ub&s;idies granted for the pro&s;ecution of the war, no &s;troke of importance was &s;truck in Europe for the advan|tage of Great Britain; but that her trea&s;ure was lavi&s;hed upon fruitle&s;s parade, or a G&mdash;n alliance &s;till more pernicious. It mu&s;t be owned, indeed, that no new attempt was made to annoy the enemy on Briti&s;h principles; for the &s;urrender of Mont|real was the natural con&s;equence of the &s;teps which had been taken, and of the mea&s;ures concerted in the cour&s;e of the preceding year.

But, in all probability, the de&s;ign of the armament was either to intimidate the French into propo&s;als of peace, to make a diver&s;ion from the Rhine by alarming the coa&s;t of Bretagne, or to throw over a body of troops into Flanders to effect a junction with the hereditary prince of Brun&s;wic, who, at the head of twenty thou&s;and men, had made an ir|ruption as far as the Lower Rhine, and even cro&s;|&s;ed that river; but he mi&s;carried in the execution of his de&s;ign.</P>

Had they really been wounds, there would be little rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e they were the immediate cau&s;e of her death, as no con&s;iderable ve&s;&s;el had been hurt, nor any of the bowels injured; but, that the in|fliction of &s;uch wounds, co-operating with other circum&s;tances of barbarity, blows, &s;tripes, and brui&s;es, might, in a body incen&s;ed with rage, and inflamed with intoxication, produce a fever, that would terminate in death, is a po&s;&s;ibility to which every judicious phy&s;ician mu&s;t &s;ub&s;cribe;

Accordingly they appeared at Vacha, &s;ituated on the frontiers of He&s;&s;e, and forming the head of the chain of cantonments which the allies had on the Werra.

At length victo|ry declared for the allies. Five battalions of the enemy, including the commander in chief, and the prince of Anhalt-cothen, were taken, with &s;ix pieces of cannon, all their arms, baggage, and artillery. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the mare|chal duke de Broglio remained encamped on the heights of Corbach. He had, in advancing from Franckfort, left detachments to reduce the ca&s;tles of Marpurg and Dillemburg, which were occu|pied by the allies, and they fell into his hands, the garri&s;ons of both being obliged to &s;urrender pri&s;o|ners of war.

<P>It is with the greate&s;t &s;a|tisfaction, that I have the ho|nour of acquainting your lord&s;hip of the &s;ucce&s;s of the hereditary prince, ye&s;terday morning.</P>
<P>General Sporcken's corps marched from the camp at Kalle to Liebenau, about four in the afternoon of the twenty-ninth; the heredi|tary prince followed the &s;ame evening, with a body of troops, among which were the two Engli&s;h batralions of grenadiers, the two of High|landers, and four &s;quadrons of dragoons, Cope's and Con|way's.</P>
<P>The army was under arms all day on the thirtieth, and, about eleven at night, march|ed off in &s;ix columns to Lie|benau. About five the next morning, the whole army a&s;&s;embled, and formed on the heights near Corbeke. The hereditary prince was, at this time, marching in two co|lumns, in order to turn the enemy's left flank; which he did by marching to Donhel|bourg, leaving Klein-Eder on his left, and forming in two lines, with his left towards Do&s;&s;el, and his right near Grimbeck, oppo&s;ite to the left flank of the enemy, who&s;e po&s;ition was, with the left to the high hill near Offendorff, and their right to Warbourg, into which place they had flung Fi&s;cher's corps. The hereditary prince immediate|ly attacked the enemy's flank, and, after a very &s;harp di&s;|pute, obliged them to give way, and, by a continual fire, kept forcing them to fell back upon Warbourg. The army was, at this time, marching with the greate&s;t diligence to attack the enemy in front; but the infantry could not get up in time: general Waldegrave, at the head of the Briti&s;h, pre&s;&s;ed their march as much as po&s;&s;ible: no troops could &s;hew more eagerne&s;s to get up, than they &s;hewed. Many of the men, from the heat of the weather, and over-&s;training them&s;elves to get on, through mora&s;&s;y and very difficult ground, &s;uddenly dropped down on their march.</P>
<P>General Mo&s;ty, who was at the head of the Briti&s;h ca|valry, formed on the right of our infantry on the other &s;ide of a large wood, upon receiv|ing the duke's orders to come up with the cavalry as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, made &s;o much expe|dition, bringing them up at a full trot, though the di&s;|tance was near five miles, that the Briti&s;h cavalry had the happine&s;s to arrive in time, to &s;hare the glory of the day, having &s;ucce&s;sfully $harged, &s;everal times, both the enemy's cavalry and in|fantry.</P>
<P>I &s;hould do inju&s;tice to the general officers, to every offi|cer and private man, of the cavalry, if I did not beg your lord&s;hip would a&s;&s;ure his ma|je&s;ty, that nothing could ex|ceed their gallant behaviour on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Captain Philips made &s;o much expedition with his cannon, as to have an op|portunity, by a &s;evere ca$|nonade, to oblige tho&s;e who had pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel, and were formed on the other &s;ide, to retire with the utmo&s;t precipitation.</P>

<P>M. de Muy is now retiring from the heights of Volk|mi&s;&s;en, where he lay under arms la&s;t night, towards Wolf|&s;hagen. I cannot give your lord&s;hip an account of the lo&s;s on either &s;ide.

and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of that city; then he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> reduced Munden, Gottingen, and Elmbeck, in the electorate of Hanover. All that prince Fer|dinand could do, con&s;idering how much he was out-numbered by the French, was to &s;ecure po&s;ts and pa&s;&s;es with a view to retard their progre&s;s, and employ detachments to harra&s;s and &s;urpri&s;e their advanced parties. In a few days after the action at Warbourg, general Luckner repul&s;ed a French detachment, which had advanced as far as Eimbeck, and &s;urpri&s;ed another at Nordheim. At the &s;ame period, colonel Donap with a body of the allied army attacked a French corps of two thou&s;and men, po&s;ted in the wood of Saba|bourg, to pre&s;erve the communication between their grand army, and their troops on the other &s;ide of the We&s;er; and, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trength of their &s;ituation, drove them from their po&s;t, with the lo&s;s of five hundred men, either killed or made pri&s;oners; but this advantage was overbalanced by the reduction of Ziegenhain, garri&s;oned by &s;even hundred men of the allied army, who, after a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance, were obliged to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. On the fifth day of Augu&s;t, prince Ferdinand be|ing encamped at Buhne, received intelligence that a con&s;iderable body of the enemy, amounting to upwards of twenty thou&s;and men, were in motion to make a general forage in the neighbourhood of Gei&s;mar. He pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel early in the morning, with a body of troops, and &s;ome artil|lery, and po&s;ted them in &s;uch an advantageous manner, as to render the enemy's attempt totally

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The he|reditary prince beats up the quar|ters of the French at Ziren|berg.</NOTE> On the &s;ame morning, the hereditary prince &s;et out on an expedition to beat up the quarters of a French detachment. Being informed that the volunteers of Clermont and Dauphine, to the number of one thou&s;and, hor&s;e and foot, were cantoned at Zierenberg, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the French camp at Dierenberg, and pa&s;&s;ed their time in the mo&s;t carele&s;s &s;ecurity, he advanced to|wards them from his camp at Warbourg, with|in a league of their cantonment, without &s;eeing any of their po&s;ts, or meeting with any of their patroles; a circum&s;tance that encouraged him to beat up their quarters by &s;urprize: for this &s;er|vice he pitched upon five battalions, with a de|tachment of Highlanders, and eight regiments of dragoons. Leaving their tents &s;tanding, they be|gan their march at eight in the evening, and pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel near Warbourg. About a league on the other &s;ide of the Dymel, at the village of Wit|zen, they were joined by the light troops under ma|jor Bulow; and now the di&s;po&s;ition was made, both for entering the town, and &s;ecuring a retreat, in ca&s;e of being repul&s;ed. When they were within two miles of Zierenberg, and in &s;ight of the fires of the enemy's grand guard, the grenadiers of Maxwel, the regiment of King&s;ley, and the High|landers, advanced by three &s;eparate roads, and marched in profound &s;ilence: at length, the noi&s;e of their feet alarmed the French, who began to fire; then the grenadiers proceeded at a round pace with unloaded firelocks, pu&s;hed the piquets,

&s;lew the guard at the gate, and ru&s;hing into the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760&punc;</NOTE> town drove every thing before them with incredi|ble impetuo&s;ity. The attack was &s;o &s;udden, and the &s;urprize &s;o great, that the French had not time to a&s;&s;emble in any con&s;iderable number; but they began to fire from the windows, and, in &s;o doing, exa&s;perated the allied troops, who, bur&s;ting into the hou&s;es, &s;laughtered them without mercy. Hav|ing remained in the place from two till three in the morning, they retreated with about four hun|dred pri&s;oners, including forty officers; and brought off two pieces of artillery. This noctur|nal adventure, in which the Briti&s;h troops di&s;play|ed equal courage and activity, was atchieved with very little lo&s;s; but, after all, it de&s;erves no other appellation, than that of a partizan exploit, for it was attended with no &s;ort of advantage to the al|lied army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Petty ad|vantages on both &s;ides.</NOTE> Con&s;idering the great &s;uperiority of the French army, we cannot account for the little progre&s;s made by the duke de Broglio, who, according to our conception, might either have given battle to the allies with the utmo&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s; or penetrated into the heart of Hanover, the con|que&s;t of which &s;eemed to be the principal object of the French mini&s;try. In&s;tead of &s;triking an important &s;troke, he retired from Immenhau&s;en towards Ca&s;&s;el, where he fortified his camp, as if he had thought him&s;elf in danger of being attacked; and the war was carried on by &s;mall detachments&punc; Major Bulow being &s;ent with a &s;trong party from the camp of the allied army at Bline, &s;urpri&s;ed the town of Marpurg, de&s;troyed the French ovens, and brought off a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;tores

He met with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s at Butzbach, where he &s;urpri&s;ed and took two companies belonging to the regi|giment of Raugrave, and retired with his body to Frankenberg, where he joined colonel For&s;en. On the twelfth day of September they made a move|ment towards Frankenau; and Mr. de Stainville, who was po&s;ted with a body of French troops at Merdenhagen, advanced to check their progre&s;s. He came up with their rear in the neighbourhood of Munden, and attacked them in pa&s;&s;ing the river Orck, with &s;uch vigour, that For&s;en, with &s;ome of his cavalry, was taken, and Bulow obliged to abandon &s;ome pieces of cannon. The action was ju&s;t determined, when this la&s;t was reinforced by the hereditary prince of Brun&s;wick, who had made a forced march of five German miles, which had fatigued the troops to &s;uch a degree, that he de|ferred his attack till next morning; but, in the mean time, M. de Stainville retired towards Frankenburg. The Hanoverian general Wan|genheim, at the head of four batta$ions and &s;ix &s;quadrons, had driven the enemy from the defiles of Soheite, and encamped at Lawenthagen; but, being attacked by a &s;uperior number, he was obliged, in his turn, to give way, and his re|treat was not effected without the lo&s;s of two hun|dred men, and &s;ome pieces of artillery. When the enemy retired, general Wangenheim repa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, and occupied his former &s;ituation at U&s;&s;ar. Mean while, general Luckner gained an advantage over a detachment of French cavalry, near Norten. Prince Ferdinand, when marechal Broglio quitted his camp at Immenhau&s;en, made

Whether this excur|&s;ion was intended to hinder the French from rein|forcing their army in We&s;tphalia, or to co-operate in the Low Countries, with the armament now rea|dy equipped in the ports of England; or to gra|tify the ambition of a young prince, overboil|ing with courage, and glowing with the de&s;ire of conque&s;t; we cannot explain to the &s;atisfaction of the reader: certain it is, the Au&s;trian Nether|lands were, at this juncture, entirely de&s;titute of troops, except the French garri&s;ons of O&s;tend and Nieuport, which were weak and incon&s;iderable&punc; Had ten thou&s;and Engli&s;h troops been landed on the coa&s;t of Blankenburg&punc; they might have taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Bruges, Ghent, Bru&s;&s;els, and Antwerp, with|out re&s;i&s;tance, and joined the hereditary prince in the heart of the country: in that ca&s;e, he would have found him&s;elf at the head of thirty thou&s;and men, and might have made &s;uch a diver&s;ion in favour of Hanover, as to transfer the &s;eat of wa$ from We&s;tphalia into Flanders. The empre&s;s queen might indeed have complained of this inva&s;ion, as the formality of declaring war again&s;t her had not been ob&s;erved by Great Britain; but, con&s;idering that &s;he was the declared enemy of Hanover, and

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> had violated the barrier treaty, in e&s;tabli&s;hing which the kingdom of Great Britain had lavi&s;hed away &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure; a &s;tep of this kind, we apprehend, might have been taken, with|out any imputation of perfidy or inju&s;tice. What|ever the motives for the prince's expedition might have been, he certainly quitted the grand army of the allies, in the month of September, and, tra|ver&s;ing We&s;tphaiia, with twenty battalions, and as many &s;quadrons, appeared on the Lower Rhine, marching by Schermbeck and Du&s;&s;eldorp. On the twenty-ninth day of the month, he &s;ent a large detachment over the river at Rocroort, which &s;ur|pri&s;ed part of the French partizan Fi&s;cher's corps at Rhynberg, and &s;coured the country. Next day, other parties, cro&s;&s;ing at Rees and Emerick, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome redoubts, which the French had rai&s;ed along the bank of the river; and here they found a number of boats &s;ufficient to tran&s;port the re&s;t of the forces. Then the prince advanced to Cleves, and, at his approach, the French garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of five hundred men, under the com|mand of M. de Barrel, retired into the ca&s;tle, which, however, they did not long defend; for on the third day of October, they capitulated, and &s;ur|rendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, after having in vain endeavoured to obtain more favourable con|ditions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He comes to We&s;el, and is wor&s;ted at Cam|pen.</NOTE> A more important object was We&s;el, which the prince inve&s;ted, and began to be&s;iege in form.

He had hoped to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> carry it by a vigorous exertion, without the for|mality of a regular &s;iege, but he met with a warmer reception than he expected; and his ope|rations were retarded by heavy rains, which, by &s;welling the river, endangered his bridges, and laid his trenches under water. The difficulties and delays occa&s;ioned by this circum&s;tance en|tirely fru&s;trated his de&s;ign. The French, being made acquainted with his motions, were not &s;low in taking mea&s;ures to anticipate his &s;ucce&s;s. M. de Ca&s;tries was detached after him, with thirty battalions, and thirty-eight &s;quadrons; and, by forced marches, arrived, on the fourteenth day of October, at Rhynberg, where the prince's light troops were po&s;ted. The&s;e he attacked imme|diately, and compelled to abandon the po&s;t, not|with&s;tanding all the efforts of the prince, who commanded in per&s;on, and appeared in the warm|e&s;t part of this &s;hort but &s;anguinary affair. The enemy, leaving five battalions, with &s;ome &s;qua|drons, at Rhynberg, marched by the left, and en|camped behind the convent of Campen. The prince, having received intimation, that M. de Ca&s;tries was not yet joined by &s;ome reinforce|ments, that were on the march, determined to be beforehand with them, and attempt that very night to &s;urpri&s;e him in his camp. For this pur|po&s;e, he began his march at ten in the evening, after having left four battalions, and five &s;qua|drons, under general Bo$k, with in&s;tructions to ob&s;erve Rhynberg, and attack that po&s;t, in ca&s;e the attempt on Campen &s;hould &s;ucceed. Before the allied forces could reach the enemy's camp,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of overpowering Fi&s;cher's corps of irregulars, which occupied the convent of Campen, at the di&s;tance of half a league in their front. This &s;ervice occa&s;ioned &s;ome firing, the noi&s;e of which alarmed the French army. Their commander formed them with great expedition, and po&s;ted them in a wood, where they were immediately attacked, and, at fir&s;t, obliged to give ground; but they &s;oon retrieved all they had lo&s;t, and &s;u&s;tained, without flinching, an uncea&s;ing fire of mu&s;quetry, from five in the morning till nine at night, when they reaped the fruits of their per&s;everance. The hereditary prince, who&s;e hor&s;e was killed under him, &s;eeing no pro&s;|&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s in prolonging an action, which had already co&s;t him a con&s;iderable number of men, thought proper to give orders for a retreat, which was not effected without con&s;u&s;ion, and left the field of battle to the enemy. His lo&s;s, on this occa&s;ion, did not fall &s;hort of &s;ixteen hun|dred choice men, killed, wounded, and taken; and this lo&s;s fell chiefly on the troops of Great-Britain, who were always found in the foremo&s;t ranks of danger. All their officers, both of in|&s;antry and dragoons, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves re|markably, and many were dangerou&s;ly wounded. Among the&s;e, the nation regretted the lo&s;s of lord Downe, who&s;e wounds proved mortal: he was a young nobleman of &s;pirit, who had lately em|braced a military life, though he was not regular|ly trained in the &s;ervice.</P>

and extended along the Rhine. The firing of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> cannon and mu&s;quetry was maintained till night. Mean while, a column of the French infantry, commanded by M. de Chabot, marched through Walach, and took po&s;t among the thickets, at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a league, in the front of the prince's army. By this time, the Rhine was &s;o much &s;welled by the rains, and the banks of it were overflowed in &s;uch a manner, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to repair and move lower down the bridge, which had been thrown over that ri|ver. This work was accordingly performed in pre&s;ence of the enemy, and, the prince, pa&s;|&s;ing without mole&s;tation, proceeded to Bruynen, where he fixed his head-quarters. His pa&s;&s;ing the Rhine &s;o ea&s;ily, under the eye of a victorious ar|my, &s;o much &s;uperior to him in number, may be counted among the fortunate incidents of his life.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The al|lies and French go into winter-quarters.</NOTE> As the enemy retreated, prince Ferdinand ad|vanced as far as Hur&s;te, where he e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters about the latter end of November. While he remained in this po&s;ition, divers &s;kirmi&s;hes happened in the neighbourhood of Gottingen. Major-general Breidenbach, at the head of two regiments of Hanoverian and Brun&s;wick guards, with a detachment of cavalry, attacked on the twenty-ninth day of November, the French po&s;t at Heydemunden, upon the river Worrau. This he carried, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, which the enemy ha&s;tily abandoned.

Neverthele&s;s, they kept the place blocked up from the twenty-&s;econd day of November to the twelfth of the following month, when the garri&s;on, in a de&s;perate &s;ally, took one of their principal po&s;ts, and com|pelled them to rai&s;e the blockade.

If the allied army had not been weak|ened, for the &s;ake of a ra&s;h, ill-concerted, and un&s;ucce&s;sful expedition to the Lower Rhine, in all probability the French would have been obliged to abandon the footing they had gained in the cour&s;e of this campaign, and in particular to re|treat from Gottingen, which they now maintained and fortified with great diligence and circum|&s;pection.</P>

For the&s;e purpo&s;es he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dippe&s;walde, Maxen, and Pretchen|dorff, as if he intended to enter Bohemia by the way of Pa&s;sberg; but this &s;cheme being found impracticable, he returned to his camp at Frey|berg; and in January the Pru&s;&s;ian and Au&s;trian armies were cantoned &s;o near each other, that daily &s;kirmi&s;hes were fought with various &s;ucce&s;s. The head of the Pru&s;&s;ian camp was formed by a body of four thou&s;and men under general Zett|witz, who, upon the twenty-ninth day of January, was attacked with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity by the Au&s;|trian general Beck, that he retreated in great con|fu&s;ion to Torgau, with the lo&s;s of five hundred men, eight pieces of artillery, and a con&s;iderable quantity of new cloathing, and other baggage. Another advantage of the &s;ame nature was gained by the Au&s;trians at Neu&s;tadt over a &s;mall body of Pru&s;&s;ians who occupied that city. In the month of March general Laudohn advanced with a &s;trong detachment of hor&s;e and foot, in order to &s;urpri&s;e the Pru&s;&s;ians, who, in attempting to effect a re|treat to Steinau, were &s;urrounded accordingly, and very roughly handled. General Laudohn &s;um|moned them twice by &s;ound of trumpet to lay down their arms; but their commanders, the cap|tains Blumenthal and Zittzwitz, rejecting the pro|po&s;al with di&s;dain, the enemy attacked them on all hands with a great &s;uperiority of number.

General Fouquet, being &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit; and having received two wounds, was at length taken pri&s;oner: about three thou&s;and of his men e&s;caped to Bre&s;lau; the re&s;t were killed, or taken; but the lo&s;s of the victors is &s;aid to have exceeded that of the vanqui&s;hed. In July general Laudohn under|took the &s;iege of Glatz, which was taken after a very faint re&s;i&s;tance: for, on the very day that the batteries were opened again&s;t the place, the garri|&s;on abandoned part of the fortifications, which the be&s;iegers immediately occupied. The Pru&s;&s;ians made repeated efforts to regain the ground they had lo&s;t; but they were repul&s;ed in all their at|tempts. At length the garri&s;on laid down their arms, and &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. From this tame behaviour of the Pru&s;&s;ians, one would ima|gine the garri&s;on mu&s;t have been very weak: a circum&s;tance which we cannot reconcile with the known &s;agacity of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch, as the place was of great importance, on account of the immen&s;e magazine it contained, including above one hundred bra&s;s cannon, a great number of mortars, and a va&s;t quantity of ammunition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He un|dertakes the &s;iege of Bre&s;|lau;</NOTE> Laudohn, encouraged by his &s;ucce&s;s at Glatz, advanced immediately to Bre&s;lau, which he began to bombard with great fury <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Germans are in ge|neral but indifferent engi|neers, and little acquainted with the art of be&s;ieging. On this occa&s;ion the Au&s;trian general had no other pro&s;pect than that of carrying the place by a &s;udden attack, or intimi|dating count Tavenzein the governor, into an immediate &s;urrender; for he knew the Ru&s;&s;ian army was at a con&s;i|derable di&s;tance, and judged from the character of prince Henry of Pru&s;&s;ia, that he would advance to the relief of the place, long before it could be taken according to the u&s;ual forms. Influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, when he had inve&s;ted the town, he &s;ent a letter to the governor, &s;pecifying, that his army con|&s;i&s;ted of fifty battalions and four&s;core &s;quadrons; that the Ru&s;&s;ian army, amounting to &s;eventy-five thou&s;and men, was within three days march of Bre&s;lau; that no &s;uccour could be expected from the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, encamped as he was on the other &s;ide of the Elbe, and over-awed by the army of count Daun; that prince Henry, far from being in a condition to bring relief, would not be able to &s;tand his ground again&s;t the Ru&s;|&s;ians; that Bre&s;lau being an open mercantile town, not a fortre&s;s, could not be de|fended without contravening the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of war; and therefore the governor, in ca&s;e of ob&s;tinacy, had no rea&s;on to expect an honour|able capitulation, the benefit of which was now offered. He, at the &s;ame time, &s;ent a memorial to the civil ma|gi&s;trates, threatening their town with de&s;truction, which could by no other means be prevented than by joining with the inhabitants in per|&s;uading the governor to em|brace immediately the terms that were propo&s;ed. Count Taven&Slungr;ein, in&s;tead of being intimidated, was encouraged by the&s;e menaces, which im|plied an apprehen&s;ion in Laudohn, that the place would be relieved. He there|fore replied to the &s;ummons he had received, that Bre&s;lau was not &s;imply a mercantile town, but ought to be con|&s;idered as a place of &s;trength, as being &s;urrounded with works and wet ditches: that the Au&s;trians them&s;elves had defended it as &s;uch after the battle of Li&s;&s;a, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;even; that the king his ma&s;ter having command|ed him to defend the place to the la&s;t extremity, he could neither comply with general Loudohn's propo&s;als, nor pay the lea&s;t regard to his threats of de&s;troying the town, as he had not been in|tru&s;ted with the care of the hou&s;es, but with the defence of the fortifications. The Au&s;trian convinced him that &s;ame evening, that he threat|ened nothing but what he meaned to perform. He opened his batteries, and poured in upon the town a mo&s;t terrible &s;hower of bombs and red-hot bullets, which continued till midnight. Du|ring this dreadful di&s;charge, which filled the place with horror and de&s;olation, he at|tempted the outworks by a&s;&s;ault. The Croats attack|ed the covered way in diffe|rent places with their u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity; but were re|pul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, by the conduct and re&s;olution of the governor and garri&s;on. The&s;e proceedings having made no impre&s;&s;ion upon Ta|venzein, the be&s;ieging gene|ral had recour&s;e again to ne|gociation, and offered the mo&s;t flattering articles of ca|pitulation, which were re|jected with di&s;dain. The go|vernor gave him to under|&s;tand, that the de&s;truction of the town had made no charge in his re&s;olution, though it was a practice contrary to the law of arms, as well as to the dictates of common hu|manity, to begin the &s;iege of a fortre&s;s by ruining the in|habitants: finally, he a&s;&s;ured him he would wait for him upon the ramparts, and de|fend the place to the utmo&s;t of his power.

Perhaps it was this intimation that de|termined the king to change his plan, and return to the Elbe.

How far this expectation was well-grounded, we mu&s;t leave the reader to judge, after having ob&s;erved, that the place was now much more defen&s;ible than it had been, when the la&s;t attempt of the Au&s;trians upon it mi&s;carried; that it was &s;ecured with a nume|rous garri&s;on, commanded by general Macguire, an officer of courage and experience.

Though the &s;uburbs towards the

The king had nothing to oppo&s;e to &s;uperior numbers, but &s;upe|rior activity, of which he determined to avail him|&s;elf without delay. In&s;tead of making a feint towards Sile&s;ia, he re&s;olved to march thither in earne&s;t; and for that purpo&s;e, cro&s;&s;ing the Elbe, encamped at Dallwitz, on the farther bank of the river, leaving general Hul&s;en with fifteen thou&s;and men in the intrenched camp of Schlettow, to maintain his footing in Saxony. On the third day of Augu&s;t he began his march for Sile&s;ia, followed by count Daun with the grand Au&s;trian army, while the detached body under Lacy took po&s;t at Rechenberg, and the imperial army encamped at Xe&s;&s;eldorf. Both the Pru&s;&s;ians and Au&s;trians marched at the rate of one hundred miles in five days: on the tenth the king took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the camp of Lignitz; and here he &s;eemed in danger of being quite &s;urrounded by the enemy, who oc|cupied the whole ground between Parchwitz and Coffendau, an extent of thirty miles. Count Daun's army formed the centre of this chain, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the heights of Wahl&s;tadt and Hochkirk: general Laudohn covered the ground between Je&s;chkendorf and Co&s;chitz: the ri&s;ing grounds of Parchwitz were &s;ecured by general Nauendorff; and M. de Beck, who formed the left, extended his troops beyond Co&s;&s;endau. The king marched&punc;

The Pru&s;&s;ians immediately pa&s;&s;ed the Katz|bach to attack this general; but he made &s;uch a &s;kilful di&s;po&s;ition for a retreat towards the army of count Daun, that he not only baffled the endea|vours of the king to bring him to action, but, by po&s;ting him&s;elf on the heights of Henner&s;dorff, anticipated his march to Jauer. In vain the Pru&s;|&s;ian monarch attempted next day to turn the ene|my on the &s;ide of the mountain, by Pom&s;en and Jager&s;dorff; the roads were found impa&s;&s;ible to the ammunition-waggons, and the king returned to the camp at Lignitz.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">obtains a victory over Lau|dohn;</NOTE> While he remained in this &s;ituation he received advice, that four and twenty thou&s;and Ru&s;&s;ians, under count Czernichew, had thrown bridges over the Oder at Auras, where they intended to cro&s;s that river, and he concluded the enemy had form|ed a de&s;ign to clo&s;e him in, and attack him with their joint forces. Daun had, indeed, projected a plan for &s;urpri&s;ing him in the night, and had ac|tually put his army in motion for that purpo&s;e; but he was anticipated by the vigilance and good fortune of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch. That prince, reflecting that if he &s;hould wait for his adver&s;aries in his camp, he ran the ri&s;que of being attacked at the &s;ame time by Lacy on his right, by Daun in his front, and by Laudohn on his left, he al|tered his po&s;ition, in order to di&s;concert their ope|rations: and, on the fourteenth day of the month,
<PB N="71" REF="720">
marched to the heights of P&s;affendorff, where he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> formed his army in order of battle. Receiving in|timation, about two in the morning, that Laudohn was in full march, advancing in columns, by Ben|nowitz, he divided his army into two &s;eparate bo|dies. One of the&s;e remained on the ground, in order to maintain the po&s;t again&s;t any attempts that might be made by count Daun to &s;uccour Laudohn; and that this &s;ervice might be the more effectually performed, the heights were fortified with batteries, &s;o judiciou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed as to impede and over-awe the whole Au&s;trian army. The king, having taken this precaution, wheeled about with &s;ixteen battalions and thirty &s;quadrons, to fall upon Laudohn as he &s;hould advance; but that general knew nothing of his de&s;ign, until he him&s;elf ar|rived at the village of P&s;affendorff about three in the morning, when the day dawning, and a thick fog gradually di&s;per&s;ing, the whole detachment of the Pru&s;&s;ian army appeared in order of battle, in a well-cho&s;en &s;ituation, &s;trengthened with a nume|rous train of artillery, placed to the be&s;t advantage. Laudohn was not a little mortified to find him&s;elf caught in his own &s;nare; but he had advanced too far to recede, and therefore, making a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, re&s;olved to &s;tand an engagement. With this view he formed his troops, as well as the time, place, and circum&s;tances would permit; and the Pru&s;&s;ians advancing to the attack, a &s;evere action en&s;ued. The king rode along the line to animate the troops, and &s;uperintended every part of the charge, hazarding his life in the mo&s;t dangerous &s;cenes of the battle to &s;uch a degree, that his hor&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="730">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> was killed under him, and his cloaths were &s;hot through in &s;everal places. The Au&s;trians main|tained the conflict with great ob&s;tinacy until &s;ix in the morning, when they gave ground, and were pur&s;ued to the Katzbach, beyond which the king would not allow his troops to pro&s;ecute the advan|tage they had gained, that they might be able to &s;uccour the right, in ca&s;e marechal count Daun &s;hould &s;ucceed in his attempt to advance again&s;t them from Lignitz. That general had actually begun his march to fall upon the Pru&s;&s;ians on one &s;ide, while Laudohn &s;hould attack them on the other; but he was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find they were decamped, and when he perceived a thick cloud of &s;moke at a di&s;tance, he immediately com|prehended the nature of the king's management. He then attempted to advance by Lignitz; but the troops and artillery which had been left on the height of P&s;affendorff, to di&s;pute his march, were &s;o advantageou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed as to render all his ef|forts abortive. Laudohn is &s;aid to have lo&s;t in the action about eight thou&s;and men, killed, wounded, and taken, including eighty officers, with twenty-three pair of colours, and eighty-two pieces of cannon: over and above this lo&s;s, the Au&s;trian ge|neral &s;uffered greatly by de&s;ertion. The Pru&s;&s;ians obtained the victory at the expence of one general, with five hundred men killed, and twelve hundred wounded. Immediately after the action the victor marched to Parchwi$z; while Daun detached prince Lowen&s;tein and general Beck, with the re&s;erve of his army, to join prince Czernichew, who had cro&s;&s;ed the Oder at Auras; but he was &s;o intimi|dated

by the defeat at Lignitz, that he forthwith<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> repa&s;&s;ed the river, and prince Lowen&s;tein retired on the &s;ide of Jauer. By this bold and well-conduct|ed adventure, the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch not only e&s;cap|ed the mo&s;t imminent hazard of a total defeat from the joint efforts of two &s;trong armies, but al&s;o pre|vented the dreaded junction of the Ru&s;&s;ian and Au&s;|trian forces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">rai&s;es the blockade of Sch|weid|nitz.</NOTE> His bu&s;ine&s;s now was to open the communica|tion with Bre&s;lau, and his brother prince Henry, whom he joined at Neumarcke. The prince, after Laudohn was obliged to relinqui&s;h the &s;iege of Bre&s;lau, had kept a watchful eye over the motions of the Ru&s;&s;ian army, which had advanced into the neighbourhood of that city, and, without all doubt, would have bombarded it from &s;ome commanding heights, had not they been prevented by prince Henry, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e po&s;ts, and fortified them with redoubts. The king, having freed Bre&s;lau from the neighbourhood of his ene|mies, and being &s;trengthened by the junction with his brother, le&s;t a con&s;iderable detachment under the command of general Goltze, to protect the country again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ian irregulars; and ad|vanced with his whole force to the relief of Sch|weidnitz, which was blocked up by the Au&s;trian army under the command of the marechal count Daun. In his march he fell upon a &s;eparate body under general Beck, made two battalions of Croats pri&s;oners, and di&s;per&s;ed &s;everal &s;quadrons. This atchievement had &s;uch an effect upon the enemy, that they rai&s;ed the blockade, and retreated with &s;ome precipitation to the mountains of Land&s;hut.</P>

Un|der&s;tanding that the army of the empire had formed a de&s;ign to cut off his communication with Torgau, he quitted his camp at Mei&s;&s;en, and marched to Strehla. The enemy having divided their forces into two bodies, one of them, on the twentieth day of Augu&s;t, attacked an advanced po&s;t of the Pru&s;&s;ians; while the other was di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a manner as to over-awe Hul&s;en's camp, and prevent him from taking any &s;tep for the re|lief of his battalions, who maintained their ground with difficulty again&s;t the &s;uperior number of the a&s;&s;ailants. In this emergency the Pru&s;&s;ian general ordered his cavalry to make a circuit round a ri&s;ing&punc;ground, and, if po&s;&s;ible, charge the enemy in flank. This order was executed with equal vigour and &s;uc|ce&s;s. They fell upon the imperial army with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, as drove their battalions and hor&s;e upon each other in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. A con|&s;iderable number of the enemy were &s;lain, and forty-one officers, with twelve hundred men, made pri&s;oners. By this advantage, which was obtained at a very &s;mall expence, general Hul&s;en opened for him&s;elf a way to Torgau, whither he in&s;tantly retreated, perceiving that the whole army of the Imperiali&s;ts was advancing to cut off his commu|nication with the Elbe: this retreat furni&s;hed the enemy with a pretext for claiming the victory.</P>

<P>I have not had the letter which you mention. We are in a manner blocked up, in regard to corre&s;pondence, by the Ru&s;&s;ians on one &s;ide the Oder, and by the Au&s;trians on the other.

You are not &s;uffi|ciently acquainted with the circum&s;tances of affairs to have a clear idea of all the dangers which threaten the &s;tate: I know, but conceal them; I keep all my fears to my&s;elf, and only communi|cate to the public my hopes, or the little good news that I can acquaint them with.

<P>I lead here the life of a military monk. I have much to think of about my affairs, and the re&s;t of my time I devote to literature, which is my con&s;olation, as it was of the con&s;ul, the father of his country and of eloquence.

The Ru&s;&s;ian army being on its retreat from Sile&s;ia, count Czernichew was &s;ent with a &s;trong detachment into the Marche of Branden|burg, while a numerous body of Au&s;trians, un|der Lacy and Brentano, penetrated into the &s;ame country from Saxony, with in&s;tructions to join the Ru&s;&s;ians at the gates of Berlin. The Pru&s;&s;ian ge|neral Hul&s;en, finding him&s;elf too weak to cope with the army of the empire in Mi&s;nia, had fallen back to this capital, where he was joined by the troops under general Werner, lately returned from Pomerania: but as their forces, after this junction, did not exceed &s;ixteen thou&s;and men, and the al|lies advancing again&s;t them amounted to forty thou&s;and, they would not pretend to oppo&s;e the enemy in the open field, nor to defend a city of &s;uch extent, and &s;o imperfectly fortified.

In favour of the city the foreign mini&s;ters there re|&s;iding, interpo&s;ed their mediation with &s;uch zeal and &s;ucce&s;s, that tolerable conditions were ob|tained. The inhabitants were indulged with the free exerci&s;e of their religion, and an immunity from violence to their per&s;ons and effects. The enemy promi&s;ed that the Ru&s;&s;ian irregulars &s;hould not enter the town; and that the king's palace &s;hould not be violated. The&s;e articles being rati|fied, the Au&s;trian and Ru&s;&s;ian troops entered the place, where they totally de&s;troyed the magazines, ar&s;enals, and founderies, with an immen&s;e quan|tity of military &s;tores, and a great number of can|non and &s;mall arms: then they demanded the im|mediate payment of eight hundred thou&s;and guil|ders; and afterwards exacted a contribution of one million nine hundred thou&s;and German crowns. Many outrages were committed by the licentious &s;oldiery, in &s;pite of all the precautions which the officers could take to pre&s;erve the mo&s;t exact di&s;|cipline.

<P>However enormous the cruelties were, to which the king's dominions were a prey la&s;t year, one would imagine that his maje&s;ty's enemies wanted to out-do them&s;elves in this re&s;pect, by their bar|barous conduct this year. It would in fact &s;eem, that after four un&s;ucce&s;sful campaigns, they thought they &s;hould more ea&s;ily obtain their ends, by means equally &s;hocking to humanity, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the practice of civilized nations, than by endeavour|ing to terminate the war by arms, and the &s;uperiority of their forces.</P>
<P>In this light all the opera|tions of this campaign, and in particular the famous ex|pedition again&s;t Berlin, natu|rally pre&s;ent them&s;elves be|fore the impartial public. The whole united forces of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, in con|junction with the numerous armies of Ru&s;&s;ia, have over|run Sile&s;ia, not with a view to fight battles, or get po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the fortre&s;&s;es by re|gular &s;ieges; but to carry fire and &s;word into a pro|vince, which they are plea&s;ed to con&s;ider at Vienna as part of the inconte&s;table domini|ons of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Towns that were already laid under contribution, have, ne|verthele&s;s, been plundered and &s;acked: Land&s;hut, in parti|cular, furni&s;hes a memorable example of this conduct, &s;o contrary to all the laws of war. The capital, and other fortre&s;&s;es in Sile&s;ia, of which they could not make them|&s;elves ma&s;ters by &s;tratagem, or other indirect methods, for want of artillery to lay &s;iege to them, have been bombarded without any hopes of &s;ucce&s;s: one would think they did it only for the plea|&s;ure of beholding a great number of hou&s;es and public edifices, on fire.</P>
<P>That unfortunate province would doubtle&s;s have been ir|recoverably ruined, had not Providence thought proper to &s;et bounds to their exce&s;&s;es, and to humble them by an event which de&s;troyed all their flattering hopes. The battle of Lignitz &s;topt the execu|tion of their va&s;t de&s;igns, and di&s;concerted their plan for the re&s;t of the campaign. Three armies each of them &s;upe|rior in number to that of the king, which had even entirely &s;urrounded him, and which counted &s;o much on the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the mea&s;ures they had taken to overwhelm him, that they had even fixed the day which was to decide his fate, were, by this victory, reduced for a long time to to|tal inaction, and obliged to think more of defending them&s;elves, than of forming offen&s;ive enterpri&s;es. The Ru&s;&s;ians retreated towards the frontiers of Poland, &s;et|ting fire to every place where they had received any lo&s;s, or apprehended an attack. The two Au&s;trian armies &s;hut them&s;elves up in the hills of Sile&s;ia, and oppo&s;ed tho&s;e na|tural barricades to the efforts which his maje&s;ty made to come to blows with them. There they waited for the i&s;|&s;ue of the diver&s;ion which the policy of the court was to procure to be made. Mar|&s;hal Soltikoff remained the whole month of September, without daring to make the lea&s;t motion, in pre&s;ence of the &s;mall corps under general Goltz; the operations of his troops being confined to the de&s;olating tho&s;e parts of Lower Sile&s;ia that were in his power. But as this proceed|ing could not deliver the Au|&s;trian army from its confined po&s;ition, which in the end might prove fatal to it, the court of Vienna again had recour&s;e to the&s;e methods, which it employs with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s to extricate it|&s;elf from a dilemma, and pre|vailed with the Ru&s;&s;ians to invade the Marche of Bran|denburgh.</P>
<P>For this end the generals Czernichef and Tottleben were detached with upwards of 20,000 men, and general Lacy was &s;ent again&s;t Berlin with 14,000 from the Au|&s;trian army. The whole Ru&s;&s;ian army followed at a &s;mall di&s;tance, to &s;u&s;tain this grand enterprize. But each party wanting to get before the other, general Tottleben, without waiting for the ar|rival of the large corps of troops, appeared on the 3d of October before Berlin, with 2000 light troops and &s;ome foot. He immediately &s;um|moned it, and upon its refu|&s;ing to &s;urrender, he threw into the town &s;ome hundreds of royal grenades, bombs, and red-hot balls, in hopes of obtaining by fire and by terror, what he could not promi&s;e him&s;elf from his for|ces. The three a&s;&s;aults made on Halle-gate were repelled; and the flames, which had broke out in five different parts, were happily extin|gui&s;hed. The prudent mea|&s;ures taken by the Pru&s;&s;ian generals who were at Berlin, at la&s;t obliged the Ru&s;&s;ian ge|neral to retire without effect|ing his purpo&s;e. Mean while, prince Eugene of W$rtem|burgh, and lieutenant-gene|ral Hul&s;en, had come to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the capital, and for &s;ome time put a &s;top to the enemy's enterpri&s;es: they would probably have obliged them wholly to drop their de&s;ign, had not count Czer|nichef, on one &s;ide, and ge|neral Lacy on the other, come up with their troops. At the &s;ame time the grand Ru&s;&s;ian army arrived at Francfort on the Oder, and general Panin, with &s;even regiments, was detached towards Berlin, to &s;u&s;tain general Czernichef; and he could be followed every day by fre&s;h detach|ments.</P>
<P>The two Pru&s;&s;ian generals above-mentioned, &s;eeing the great &s;uperiority of the ene|my, would not expo&s;e the city to the precarious i&s;&s;ue of a battle, and re&s;olved to give it time to capitulate, in order to prevent the calamities to which it might be expo&s;ed; accordingly they withdrew on the 6th, before day-break, to Spandau, and the governor and the magi&s;trates made &s;e|parate capitulations with ge|neral Tottleben. It was agreed that the town &s;hould be delivered up to the Ru&s;|&s;ians; that the garri&s;on, con|&s;i&s;ting of two battalions of Itzenplitz's regiment, and one battalion of Ludenitz's mili|tia, &s;hould be pri&s;oners of war; and that, on paying a contribution of 1,500,000 crowns, and 200,000 as a gra|tuity to the troops, for which the town was obliged to be|come bound, it &s;hould enjoy full liberty, protection and &s;afety, while the enemy &s;ta$d in it. The pri&s;oners, who, at the mo&s;t, amounted but to 1200 men, and not to 4000, as the foreign news-papers have given out, were carried off; and the cadets, who could not be comprehended in the capi$ul$ti n, which mentions only generals, offi|cers, &s;ubal$ern$, and &s;oldiers, were carried away with the re&s;t on foot. Though &s;carce above ten or twelve ye rs old, their tender age could not &s;ecure them from this hard u&s;age&punc; which we hear, hath already put an end to many of their lives.</P>
<P>According to the public news-papers, the Ru&s;&s;ian ge|nerals divided them among them&s;elves&punc; to take the keep|ing of them, as if they were &s;laves condemned to perpe|tual capti $ty. Neverthele&s;s, they can be con&s;idered only in two lights: If they were pri|&s;oners of war, they ought to be exchanged; and, if they were not, they were unju&s;tly carried away, and ought to be immediately di&s;charged.</P>
<P>By virtue of the capitula|$i$n $span$ with general Had$ick in $word$ the city of Berlin was $span$ to be mo|le$$ed or $span$ by the Au$trian$ during the whole cour&s;e of this war: never|thele&s;s, &s;ome Au&s;t$i$n regi|ments took up their quarters b$ force, and again&s;t the will of the Ru&s;&s;ians, at Frederick|$$adt, and in the New-$own, where, by this act of violence, and the exce&s;&s;es of every kind which they were guilty of, they gave &s;uch proofs how little they regard their own engagements.</P>
<P>The capitulation made by general Tot$leben was no better ob&s;erved&punc; either by the Ru&s;&s;ians or Au&s;trians. By the third article of the two capitulations for the garri&s;on, and the town, it was &s;ettled, that no &s;oldier &s;hould be quartered in the city or &s;ub|urbs; that the light troops &s;hould not be permitted to enter the place; and that both the royal palaces and private hou&s;es &s;hould be en|tirely &s;afe, and not be expo&s;ed to pillage: neverthele&s;s, &s;e|veral Au&s;trian regiments took up their quarters in the town, as hath ju&s;t been mentioned. They even lived at di&s;cretion; and, not content with eating and drinking at the expence of their landlords, they com|pelled them to give them mo|ney, goods, and whatever they a&s;ked. There are but few inhabitants of Berlin, whom the&s;e gue&s;ts did not co&s;t hundreds or thou&s;ands of crowns. The town was, in a manner, over-run with co&s;|&s;acks, hu&s;&s;ars, and other light troops, who robbed both in the &s;treets and in the hou&s;es, and wherever they came. Nor was the regular troops wholly free from this re|proach; the Au&s;trians, in particular, di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves in the&s;e exploits. On a careful enquiry it hath been found, that 282 private hou&s;es were broke and plun|dered, and the inhabitants compelled, by the mo&s;t bar|barous acts of violence, to part with money, watches, and whatever the &s;oldiers had a mind to. A very great number of per&s;ons were beat, cut with &s;words, and abu&s;ed in &s;uch a cruel manner, that ma|ny are &s;till in danger of their lives from the wounds they received. A woman named Schack was found dead on the quay of Collen, with her body disfigured by wounds. People &s;carce dared to appear in the &s;treets for fear of be|ing robbed; and mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s obliged them to be abroad in the evening, or at night, were &s;tripped of every thing. The king's &s;tables, which by the capitulation were not to be touched, were a principal object of the enemy's ravage, though the Ru&s;&s;ian com|mander had placed there a &s;afeguard of twenty-four $word$ All his maje&s;ty's coaches, which could not, &s;urely, $e reckoned implements of war, were broke to pieces, after being &s;tripped of the velvet, embroidery, and l$ce; and the apartments of M. Schv e|rin, one of the king's eque$|$ies, which are over the $$a|bles, were plundered. The ho&s;pital for invalids, and the ho&s;pital called la Charit&eacute;, tho&s;e retreats of the unhappy, the infirm, and the indigent, which one would im$gine, the mo&s;t cruel enemy would have re&s;pected, were not &s;pared, but pillaged, and ex|po&s;ed to other exce&s;&s;es of different kinds. In the church of Jeru&s;alem&punc; the Au&s;trians robbed the v$&s;try and the poo$'s box, and opened &s;ome graves to &s;trip the dead. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that general Tottie$$n&punc; and briga|dier Bachman, who was ap|pointed vice-governor, en|deavoured to maintain order and di&s;cipline in the city, and that they even put a &s;top to &s;ome exce&s;&s;es committed by the troops: but mo&s;t of the di&s;orders were &s;uffered to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed; and by the ex|ce&s;&s;es committed in breach of the c$$i$ulati$$&punc; the city &s;u&s;|tains a lo&s;s of &s;ome hundred thou&s;and crowns, over and above the enormous contri|bution exacted from it.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, what hap|pened at Berlin was nothing compared to what was done in the &s;mall towns and the flat country, the whole, from the gates of Berlin to the di&s;|tance of &s;everal miles, being laid totally de&s;olate. In par|ticular the Au&s;trian, Ru&s;&s;ian, and Saxon troops joined to leave the mo&s;t dete&s;table marks of their rage and in|humanity at the ca&s;tle of Charlottenbourg. E&s;terha|$i's Au&s;trian hu&s;&s;ars, and the Saxon uhlans, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in this exploit, and their officers looked on un|concerned. Whole &s;quadrons entered the ca&s;tle on the 9th of October, and plundered it for four days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, without receiving the lea&s;t check from either general or officer. All the $ape&s;try was torn down; looking-gla&s;&s;es, pictures, tables, chairs, china, in &s;hort, all that was of any value, was broke or &s;poilt, except a large quantity of ef|fects which &s;ome greedy offi|cers took for them&s;elves, and &s;ent away in covered wag|go$s. Even the king's cha|pel, that &s;acred place, which the mo&s;t &s;avage nations would have re&s;pected, was ravag|ed, and profaned by their na&s;tine&s;s, and the organs broke. In the apartments of the ca&s;tle, the pictures of the royal family were &s;poilt and disfigured, and &s;everal &s;tatues of the celebrated cabinet of cardinal Polignac, valuable monuments of antiquity, were muti$ated or damaged. In &s;hort, &s;uch havock was made at this country-&s;eat, that &s;carce any thing more than the walls can properly be &s;aid to be left. Neverthele&s;s, the plunder got here did not &s;a|tisfy the enemy's greedine&s;s, nor &s;ecure the inhabitants of the town from being plun|dered, though they had ran|&s;omed them&s;elves by the pay|ment of 15000 crowns in ready money. Every thing was taken from them; and what could not be carried away was broke or de&s;troy|ed. Several inhabitants were hor&s;ewhipped and cut with $abr$s; of which two died. Even the women, without di&s;|tinction of age, were expo&s;ed to the rage of the enemy, and made victims of their brutality.</P>
<P>Schoenhau&s;en, the queen's country-hou&s;e, &s;hared much the &s;ame fate. A Ru&s;&s;ian &s;u|baltern arrived there on the 8th of October, with $ight hu&s;&s;ars, and demanded, with grievous threats, her maje&s;|ty's plate. In vain he was told, that it had been carried long before to a place of &s;afe|ty: they &s;earched the ca&s;tle, and not finding what they wanted, pulled down, and $ore the tape&s;try and the cur|tains, and, taking what they liked, went to the hou&s;e of the keeper of the ca&s;tle, &s;tripped him and his wife, beat him with rods and whips, and even pinched them with red-hot pinchers in &s;uch a cru|el manner, that both are &s;till dangerou&s;ly ill. The gene|rals Czernichef and Tottle|ben, being informed of the&s;e cruelties, promi&s;ed, indeed, to put a &s;top to them; but in&s;tead thereof, the ca&s;tle was totally de&s;olated between the 9th and the 12th. All the tape&s;try and curtains left af|ter the former vi&s;it were torn, and the chairs, pictures, and china, broke to pieces. In &s;hort, Schoenhau&s;en was made a de&s;art; nor did the officers b$longing to it, or the village of Pankow, which adjoins to it, fare better. A &s;ervant be|longing to the ca&s;tle was laid on the fire in his own apart|ment, and the mini&s;ter's foot|man hacked to death with $abres. The women were di&s;|honoured in the mo&s;t barba|rous manner: all the cattle were driven away, and every hou&s;e and barn emptied.</P>
<P>The palace of the margrave Charles at Friedrichfelde re|ceived the &s;ame treatment from the Ru&s;&s;ians; and mo&s;t of the provincial towns met with no more favour. Frank|fort, in particular, was mo&s;t grievou&s;ly harra&s;&s;ed many ways, though the enemy's generals had given the magi&s;|trates a&s;&s;urances in writing, that they had no farther ex|actions to fear. Lieutenant colonel R$$$hewsky lighted a large fire in the great &s;quare, with which he threatened to $et the city in flames. A burgoma&s;ter was whipped in a cruel manner, and all the magi&s;trates threatened with the &s;ame treatment. By the&s;e violent mea&s;ures they ex|torted great quantities of cloth, li$en, and forage, and a contribution of 50,000 crowns, be&s;ides what was given under the title of ex|traordinaries, which, how|ever, did not prevent many acts of cruelty and robbery from being committed in that town, where the damage amounts to above 200,000 crowns.</P>
<P>The fate of Copenick, Fur&s;tenwalk, Be&s;kow, Alt-Lansberg, Strasberg, O|rangeberg, Lubenwalde, and, in general, all the towns in the Marcne&punc; where the ene|my came, was equally hard. They were forced to pay con|tributions, and to furni&s;h things much above their abi|lities, and, after all, were ex|po&s;ed to pillage and &s;hocking acts of cruelty. But nothing can come up to the dreadful $ight which the flat country pre&s;ents, from Berlin to the frontiers of Poland, Sile&s;ia, and Saxony, wherever the enemy have been. The vil|lages are entirely plundered, and the country people left de$ti$ute both of corn and cattle. Their beds, their fur|niture, and, in &s;hort, all they had, is carried off. The corn which the enemy could not u&s;e, or carry off, they &s;cat|tered about, and threw into the dirt. All the cattle, cows, as well as hor&s;es, oxen, and &s;heep, were taken: a|bove 100,000 head had pa&s;&s;ed through Frankfort. Some villages were &s;et on fire, particularly Schoneberg and Gro&s;&s;en&punc;Beer. In &s;hort, wherever they came, they beat and abu&s;ed the inhabi|tants in the mo&s;t cruel man|ner, and barbarou&s;ly di&s;ho|noured the women&punc; without di&s;tinction of age or condi|tion, in pre&s;ence of their pa|rents and husbands. In fine, to fill up the mea&s;ure of their deeds of inhumanity and hor|ror, they laid a&s;ide all regard to the &s;epulchres of the dead, which have always been held in a kind of veneration by the mo&s;t barbarous nations. The troops under general Lacy, in their return thro' Wilmer&s;dorff, an e&s;tate be|longing to the Schwerin fa|mily, broke open the bury|ing vault, opened the coffin of the ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e to the king, who had been dead 12 years, and tho&s;e of his lady and children, &s;tript the bo|dies, and threw them on the ground. The&s;e barbarities, of which the hi&s;tory of the lea&s;t civilized nations fur|ni&s;hes few examples, will be handed down to the mo&s;t di&s;|tant po&s;terity, and perpetuate the &s;hame of Pru&s;&s;ia's ene|mies.</P>
<P>What is &s;aid above, is only a brief &s;ummary&punc; and as it were the out-lines of the &s;cene of deva&s;tation which the king's enemies made in the Marche in their la&s;t in|va&s;ion. A detail of particu|lars would fill volumes. But no fact has been mentioned, but what any one may be convinced of by the te&s;timony of their own &s;en&s;es. We have not taken the liberty to make ill grounded and exag|gerated complaints, &s;uch as are tho&s;e of a court, which employs venal pens to excite fal&s;e compa&s;&s;i$n, by magni|fying the evils it hath brought on it&s;elf through its own fault. It is well known how it filled Europe with its cla|mours, when its capital, de|$ended by its allies as if it had been a regular fortre&s;s, &s;u&s;tained, more thro' their fault, than that of the be|&s;iegers, the natural con&s;e|quence of a &s;iege; while it appears quite in&s;en&s;ible at the fate of the city of Witten|berg, which tho&s;e very allies reduced to a&s;hes without any nece&s;&s;ity, and almo&s;t without having fired again&s;t the ram|parts. It forgets probably, or wants to make the public forget, that its allies made no &s;cruple to bombard likewi&s;e without $$$e&s;&s;ity, and for the mo&s;t part without &s;ucce&s;s, Zittau, Schweidnitz, Cu$$rin, Colberg, Bre$$an, B$r$in, and Co$el: and that in this man|ner they reduced a part of tho&s;e towns to a&s;hes, and greatly damaged the re&s;t. That court would at pre&s;ent have great rea&s;on to make the mo&s;t &s;erious reflections on the obligation it lies un|der to its troops, and tho&s;e of its allies, for the conduct they have held, if the king were di&s;po&s;ed to follow bad exam|ples, and to retaliate on the &s;ubjects of Saxony the cala|mities which his &s;ubjects have been &s;o unju&s;tly made to &s;uf|fer. But his maje&s;ty's man|ner of thinking will always prevent
his recurring to &s;uch rigorous methods, till he be forced to it by indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity. He de$e&s;t$ this illi|cit manner of making war the more, as it contributes &s;o little to the end for which war is waged. This truth ap|pears evident from the la&s;t expedition of the enemy into the Marche. They found it very ea&s;y to &s;lip, as it were, into Brandenburgh, with an army of 80&punc;000 men, and to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of an open city defended by a handful of men. But as &s;oon as his ma$je&s;ty, informed of this inva&s;ion, flew to the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of his oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ub|jects, and approached the frontier only, all tho&s;e troops of the enemy fled precipi|tately, and retired, &s;ome to Poland, and &s;ome to Saxony. It is not denied that they did hurt; but the damage is not irreparable, and can have no influence on the future ope|rations of the war. The di|ver&s;ion which the enemy pro|po&s;ed to make by it, far from favouring their affairs in Sax|ony, and Sile&s;ia, hath given the king an opportunity to reconquer the former, and to deliver the latter. Thus Haddick's enterprize again&s;t Berlin was followed in 1757, by the glorious victories of Rosbach and Li&s;&s;a. The late expedition of the Ru&s;&s;ians and Au&s;trians again&s;t Berlin hath &s;erved, notwith&s;tanding all that hath been publi&s;hed, to ruin, without any rea&s;on, and without any end, &s;ome thou|&s;ands of innocent &s;ubjects. But it hath di&s;played the ene|mies of Pru&s;&s;ia, in their true colours, to all Europe, and laid open the fal&s;ity, the in|ju&s;tice, and the cruelty of the principles on which they act, in this war. It &s;hould &s;eem that the court of Vienna wanted to reali&s;e, on this oc|ca&s;ion, the &s;hocking expre&s;|&s;ion of one of its generals, "That they mu&s;t leave the &s;ubjects of Brandenburgh on|ly free air and the bare ground." Unable hitherto to cru&s;h the king, the mag|nanimous defender of the German liberties, it again hath recour&s;e to tho&s;e me|thods which the Ferdinands [of Au&s;tria] employed in the la&s;t century, to reduce the whole empire under their de&s;potic yoke. By its con|duct in our days, it renews the &s;ad remembrance of that long and bloody war which Germany then groaned un|der, for the &s;pace of thirty years. Let all Europe con&s;i|der at pre&s;ent what it hath to expect from &s;uch an enemy. Let it judge whether the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, in ca&s;e it could accompli&s;h the depre&s;|&s;ion of that of Brandenburgh, would not extend in its ambi|tious views farther; and, to gain its end, &s;eek to involve other &s;tates in the calamities in which it wants to plunge tho&s;e of his maje&s;ty. But Providence, which hath al|ready &s;o often defeated the projects of this hou&s;e, and which hath recently humbled its pride by the defeat at Tor|gau, will &s;till &s;et fre&s;h bounds to its ambition in the &s;equel of this war. We mu&s;t hope that by it's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the king will continue to defend him|&s;elf &s;ucce&s;sfully again&s;t the league formed again&s;t him by the infinuations and intrigues of the court of Vienna; and that all the efforts of his ene|mies will not prevent the mo&s;t di&s;tant po&s;terity from acknowledging him to have been the defender of the Pro|te&s;tant religion and the liber|ties of Germany.</P>
<P><HI>The following is an An&s;wer to the foregoing relation of the ravages committed by the Au&s;trians, Ru&s;&s;ians, and Sax|ons, in Brandenburgh, pub|li&s;hed at Dre&s;den, and re|printed in the Bru&s;&s;els Ga|zette.</HI></P>
<P>The inhabitants of Berlin have been more frightened than hurt. As they had, by their acclamations and ap|plau&s;es, been accomplices in the exce&s;&s;es committed by their ma&s;ter in Saxony, they expected repri&s;als: but the generals of the two empre&s;|&s;es di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves as much at Berlin, by their genero&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion, as tho&s;e of Pru&s;&s;ia in Saxony by their obduratene&s;s and bar|barity. Yet the Pru&s;&s;ian Ga|zette hath the a&s;&s;urance to complain of a contribution of 1,800,000 crowns; of the plundering the ar&s;enal, and the de&s;truction of the pow|der-mill. The generals La|cy and Tottleben carried off the arms and uniforms that were in the king's magazines: they rendered un&s;erviceable the royal foundery, which continually replaced in the enemies armies the artillery which the imperial troops took from them at the price of their blood. The furni|ture of two country &s;eats, the embelli&s;hments of which had been directed by the mo&s;t rigorous oeconomy, was da|maged by the &s;oldiers, who, in other re&s;pects, ob&s;erved the exacte&s;t di&s;cipline. Com|pare the lo&s;&s;es of the Pru&s;|&s;ians with ours, and with tho&s;e of the king-elector, who&s;e augu&s;t family, pri&s;o|ners in their own palace, have &s;een the apartments of it broke open, the locks of the cabinets picked, their do|me&s;tics obliged to ran&s;om them&s;elves, their officers rob|bed, the fine&s;t furniture fold by auction for a trifle, their country &s;eats converted into ho&s;pitals and &s;tables, till the rage of the Pru&s;&s;ians reduced them to a heap of rubbi&s;h; the capital &s;et on fire and burnt; the gardens that &s;ur|rounded it de&s;troyed and dug up, from mere wantonne&s;s; the ornaments of them de|&s;troyed by expre&s;s order of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; our ar|&s;enal, which contained only rich and curious pieces, car|ried to Berlin by an enemy who&s;e de&s;tructive &s;pirit is al|ways &s;ubordinate to his avi|dity; the ca&s;tles and e&s;tates of the mini&s;ters and princi|pal nobility and gentry demo|li&s;hed and laid wa&s;te, after being &s;everal times ran&s;omed; the men carried off from the towns and villages, the hou|&s;es of the citizens plundered methodically, the magi&s;trates thrown into dungeons, to compel them to deliver up the effects of the widow and the orphan; and to extort from the unfortunate inhabitants the little money they had $id from the Pru&s;&s;ian tax-gather|ers.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a part only of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which the gene|rals of the empre&s;&s;es had to take vengeance for. But their imperial maje&s;ties have too much magnanimity to make unhappy &s;laves an&s;wer|able for what they did by the command of a de&s;potic ma&s;|ter. It is the royal hou&s;e of Pru&s;&s;ia that owes &s;atisfaction to the powers it hath offend|ed. Its &s;ubjects, perhaps, have been long wi&s;hing in their hearts, that they may take it complete in the trea|ty of peace.</P></NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> In the royal palace of Charlottenburg they pil|laged

<P>The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, in his march through Lu&s;at$a, was &s;till attended by count Daun at the head of his grand army; and both pa&s;&s;ed the Elbe about the latter end of October. The Pru&s;&s;ians cro&s;&s;ed the river at Co&s;wick, where he as joined by the troops under prince Eugene of Wirtemberg, and general Hul&s;en; &s;o that his army now amounted to eighty thou&s;and fighting men, with whom he re&s;olved to &s;trike &s;ome &s;troke of importance. Indeed, at this time his &s;ituation was truly critical. General Lau|dohn, with a con&s;iderable body of Au&s;trians, re|mained in Sile&s;ia; the Ru&s;&s;ian army &s;till threat|ened Bre&s;lau, the capital of that country. The Imperiali&s;ts and Au&s;trians had taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the great towns in Saxony, and were ma&s;ters on both &s;ides of the Elbe. In the ea&s;tern part of Pomerania the Ru&s;&s;ians had in|ve&s;ted Colberg by &s;ea and land, &s;eemingly deter|mined to reduce the place, that they might have a &s;ea-port, by which they could be &s;upplied with provi&s;ion, ammunition, nece&s;&s;aries, and reinforce|ments, without the trouble and inconvenience of a long and laborious march from the banks of the Vi&s;tula.</P>
<P>On the we&s;tern &s;ide of Pomerania, the war which had hitherto langui&s;hed was renewed by the Swedes with uncommon vivacity. They pa&s;&s;ed the river Pene without oppo&s;ition; and oblig|ing general Stullerheim to retreat, advanced as far as Stransberg. That officer, however, be|ing

<P>Thus the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch &s;aw him&s;elf obliged to abandon Sile&s;ia, deprived of all the places he held in Saxony, which had been his be&s;t re|&s;ource; and in danger of being driven into his hereditary country of Brandenburg, which was unable either to maintain, or even to recruit his army.</P>

The right wing of the Au&s;trians being at Gro&s;wich, and their left at Torgau, the Pru&s;|&s;ian king determined to attack them next day, which was the third of November. His de&s;ign was to march through the wood of Torgau by three different routes, with thirty battalions and fifty &s;quadrons of his left wing: the fir&s;t line was ordered to advance by the way of Mackrene to Neiden; the &s;econd, by Peckhutte to El&s;ni k; and the third, con&s;i&s;ting of cavalry, to penetrate by the wood of W$lde$$ayn to Vogel&s;ang.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> On the other hand general Ziethen was directed to take the great Leip&s;ick road, with thirty batta|lions and &s;eventy &s;quadrons of the right; and quitting it at the ponds of Torgau, to attack the villages of Suptitz and Gro&s;wich. The king's line in its march, fell in with a corps of Au&s;trians under general Reid, who retired into the wood of Torgau; and another more con&s;iderable body, po&s;ted in the wood of Wildenhayn, likewi&s;e re|treated to Gro&s;chutz, after having fired &s;ome pieces of artillery: but the dragoons of St. Ignon, being enclo&s;ed between two columns of Pru&s;&s;ian infan|try, were either killed or taken. By two in the afternoon the king had penetrated through the wood to the plain of Neiden, from whence an|other body of the enemy retired to Torgau, where a continued noi&s;e of cannon and &s;mall arms declared, that general Zeithen was already engaged. The Pru&s;&s;ians immediately advanced at a quicker pace, and pa&s;&s;ing the mora&s;&s;es near Neiden, inclined to the right in three lines, and &s;oon came to action. Daun had cho&s;en a very advantageous po&s;ition: his right extended to Gro&s;wich, and his left to Zinne; while his infantry occupied &s;ome eminences along the road of Leip&s;ick; and his front was &s;trength|ened with no le&s;s than two hundred pieces of cannon. His &s;econd line was di&s;po&s;ed on an extent of ground, which terminated in hillocks towards the Elbe; and again&s;t this the king di|rected his attack.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> He had already given his troops to under|&s;tand, that his affairs were in &s;uch a &s;ituation, they mu&s;t either conquer or peri&s;h: and they be|gan the battle with the mo&s;t de&s;perate impe|tuo&s;ity; but they met with &s;uch a warm re|ception from the artillery, &s;mall arms, and in particular from the Au&s;trian carbineers, that their grenadiers were &s;hattered and repul&s;ed. The &s;econd charge, though enforced with in|credible vigour, was equally un&s;ucce&s;sful: then the king ordered his cavalry to advance, and they fell upon &s;ome regiments of infantry with &s;uch fury as obliged them to give way. The&s;e, however, were compelled to retire, in their turn, before about &s;eventy battalions of the enemy, who advanced towards Torgau, &s;tretch|ing with their right to the Elbe, and their left to Zinne. While the prince of Hol&s;tein rallied his cavalry, and returned to the charge, the third line of Pru&s;&s;ian infantry attacked the vineyard of Suptitz, and general Ziethen with the right wing took the enemy in rear. This di&s;po&s;ition threw the Au&s;trians into di&s;order, which was greatly augmented by the di&s;a&s;ter of count Daun, who was dangerou&s;ly wounded in the thigh, and carried off the field of battle. But the Pru&s;&s;ians could not pur&s;ue their vic|tory, becau&s;e the action had la&s;ted until nine, and the night, being unu&s;ually dark, facilitated the retreat of the enemy, who cro&s;&s;ed the Elbe on three bridges of boats, thrown over the river at Torgau.</P>

The carnage was very great on both &s;ides: about three thou&s;and Pru&s;&s;ians were killed, and five thou&s;and wounded; and, in the fir&s;t attacks, two general officers, with fifteen hundred &s;ol|diers, were made pri&s;oners by the enemy.

He there|fore declared, that as the country of Mecklen|bourg was impoveri&s;hed and almo&s;t depopulated by the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions, the duke would find him&s;elf obliged to take mea&s;ures for the future &s;ecurity of his &s;ubjects, if not immediately favoured with &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the court of Vienna as would put a &s;top to tho&s;e violent proceedings.

<P>"Since the troubles be|gan, that de&s;olate Germany, his maje&s;ty the king of Po|land, elector of Saxony, hath been too often obliged to make ju&s;t complaints to his high allies, to the diet of the empire, and to all Europe. Stript of his hereditary do|minions by a neighbour, who, on entering them, a&s;ked only a pa&s;&s;age through them, made prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip towards the &s;overeign, and declared he had no ground of complaint again&s;t him, nor any claim on the country; the king could not but look on the acts of ho&s;tility com|mitted by the Pru&s;&s;ians as &s;o many injuries, as &s;o many breaches of the law of na|tions, and manife&s;t violations of the laws of the empire. But things were &s;oon carried to &s;uch a length, that Saxony would have thought her&s;elf too happy to find in the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, not a depo&s;itary, but a declared enemy, pro|vided this enemy would have re&s;pected the laws and cu&s;|toms of war, which humani|ty pre&s;cribes, and which all civilized nations have hither|to ob&s;erved. She would not, in that ca&s;e, have &s;een her towns &s;ubjected to contribu|tions which exceed all mea|&s;ure; the &s;uburbs of the ca|pital &s;et on fire, without ne|ce&s;&s;ity; the lands laid wa&s;te; and, what completes her mi&s;|fortunes, her young men torn from her by force, and con|&s;trained to bear arms again&s;t their &s;overeign: horrid treat|ment! and &s;o oppo&s;ite to humanity, that it is without example, not among civilized nations only, but even among the greate&s;t barbarians.</P>
<P>Sunk under &s;uch grievous oppre&s;&s;ions, Saxony &s;eemed to have no room to fear that her condition could be wor&s;e. Neverthele&s;s, &s;he hath found within the &s;pace of the la&s;t year, that fre&s;h misfortunes were in re&s;erve for her; and that, if the Pru&s;&s;ians &s;eemed for &s;ome time to pre&s;erve the country, it was only that they them&s;elves might enjoy its produce. This tenderne&s;s was not dictated by humanity, but by intere&s;t. As the danger of being expelled Saxony in|crea&s;ed, they di&s;played their cruelty. If they quitted any part of the country without hope of returning, they gave it up to pillage: wherever they came, the unhappy pea|&s;ant was plundered without mercy; grain, forage, hor&s;es, cattle of all kinds, were taken from him; and he was left without &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Whole families, and the be&s;t work|men of all &s;orts, were carried off: even women found no &s;afeguard in their &s;ex; but all who were thought u&s;eful for Brandenburgh were torn from their families, and car|ried into &s;lavery.</P>
<P>The city of Dre&s;den re|mained. Notwith&s;tanding the ruin of its &s;uburbs, it &s;till maintained a numerous peo|ple: it was the re&s;ource of the neighbouring country. To complete the ruin of Sax|ony, the unfortunate city was to be de&s;troyed. Had the enemy attacked the place ac|cording to the rules and cu&s;|toms of war, had they di|rected their efforts again&s;t the ramparts, the king would, without doubt, have lament|ed the evils that would have re&s;ulted from it to his people; but he would have lamented them without complaining: and though in the fierce&s;t wars the re&s;idences of &s;ove|reigns have hitherto been ge|nerally &s;pared, his maje&s;ty would have been &s;ilent; for, in &s;hort, one is accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider the king of Pru&s;&s;ia not as an ordinary enemy: but the Pru&s;&s;ians made war on the innocent town&s;men: their fire was wholly directed again&s;t the hou&s;es; and they endeavoured to de&s;troy a town which they could not take.</P>
<P>The king cannot forbear pointing out to all Europe this remarkable circum&s;tance, that the enemy redoubled their fire again&s;t the hou&s;es in Dre&s;den, and did them the greate&s;t damage, when the arrival of M. Daun, with his whole army, left them no hope of being able to take the place; and, in &s;hort, that in drawing off their men from the &s;uburbs before Wil&s;|druff-gate, they laid in a&s;hes upwards of an hundred hou&s;es that had e&s;caped in the pre|ceding fires. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;ucceeded in complet|ing the misfortunes of Saxo|ny by the di&s;a&s;ters that be&s;el the capital. Three hundred and fifty hou&s;es de&s;troyed, with all that was in them, and a great many others half ruined, are a fatal lo&s;s to a city already exhau&s;ted by four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years of misfor|tunes. After the&s;e things, the king thinks it &s;carce worth while to mention his palaces and his gardens, which were &s;acked and ruin|ed, in contempt of the re|gard u&s;ually paid from one &s;overeign to another. Is there a man in the empire, or even in all Europe, who doth not &s;ee in the&s;e terrible effects an implacable hatred, and a de|&s;tructive fury, which all na|tions ought to concur in re|pre&s;&s;ing?</P>
<P>It is not to render his ene|my odious, that the king holds up this picture to all the powers in Europe, and particularly to his co-e&s;tates, and his high allies; but in hopes of exciting them to redouble their efforts, with|out delay, for the deliverance of Saxony, and not &s;uffer that unfortunate country to be ab&s;olutely ruined, to move their compa&s;&s;ion in favour of an innocent people, reduced to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and who can expect but a very feeble $word$ from their &s;overeign, &s;tr$pt him&s;elf of all things by acts of oppre&s;|&s;ion, no lo&s;s violent than un|fore&s;een.</P>
<P>This inability is of all his maje&s;ty's misfortunes the mo&s;t &s;evere. He loves his people. He h$th a father's bowels for them; and he &s;ees them over|whelmed with di&s;tre&s;s, with|out being able to &s;uccour them. The king hath the con&s;olation left of employ|ing, in their favour, all that the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e, his invariable love of ju&s;tice, and the great &s;acrifices he hath made for the common ad|vantage, and the pre&s;ervation of the empire; in &s;hort, all the regard and attention that he may merit by his misfor|tunes from the friendly pow|ers. By all the&s;e titles he conjures tho&s;e powers to take the propere&s;t mea&s;ures for the relief and pre&s;ervation of the &s;ubjects left him in Saxo|ny.</P>
<P>As to what regards him per&s;onally, his maje&s;ty puts his whole tru&s;t in the &s;ove|reign ma&s;ter of kings, in that judge who &s;earcheth the heart, and weigheth right in the &s;cales of ju&s;tice. He is encouraged to hope that he will, in the end, be plea&s;ed to enable him to dry up the tears of the Saxons, to guard them for the future from all external violence, and to en|&s;ure their dome&s;tic happine&s;s by paternal government.</P>
<P>His con&s;cience beareth him this precious witne&s;s, that he hath not drawn &s;o many evils upon him&s;elf and his dominions by unju&s;t or am|bitious enterprizes. The ju&s;|tice of his cau&s;e is &s;o evident, &s;o inconte&s;tible, and even &s;o fully acknowledged by every one, that he cannot be re|fu&s;ed an indemnification pro|portioned to his lo&s;&s;es, if in the future pacification any re|gard be paid to ju&s;tice and equity.&punc;</P></NOTE> All Europe pitied the hard

In the month of October admiral Ste|vens<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reduc|tion of Pondi|cherry in the Ea&s;t Indies.</NOTE> &s;ailed from Trincamaley with all his &s;qua|dron, in order to its being refitted, except five &s;ail of the line, which he left under the command of captain Haldane to block up Pondicherry by &s;ea, while Mr. Coote &s;hould carry on his operations by land. By this di&s;po&s;ition, and the vigilance of the Briti&s;h officers, the place was &s;o hampered as to be greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for want of provi&s;ions, even before the &s;iege could be undertaken in form; for the rainy &s;ea&s;on rendered all regular approaches impracticable. The&s;e rains being abated by the twenty&punc;&s;ixth day of November, colonel Coote di|rected the engineers to pitch upon proper places for erecting batteries, that &s;hould enfilade or flank the works of the garri&s;on, without expo&s;ing their own men to any &s;evere fire from the enemy. Ac|cordingly four batteries were con&s;tructed in dif|ferent places, &s;o as to an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es, and opened altogether on the eighth day of December at midnight.

Though the ap|proaches were retarded &s;ome days by a violent &s;torm, which almo&s;t ruined the works, the damage was &s;oon repaired; a con&s;iderable po&s;t was taken from the enemy by a&s;&s;ault, and afterwards re|gained by the French grenadiers, through the timidity of the Sipoys, by whom it was occupied.

<P>Art. I.

<P N="2">II. They &s;hall be main|tained in the exerci&s;e of the Roman Catholic religion, in the &s;ame manner as has been practi&s;ed under the French government. The churches and the hou&s;es of the eccle|&s;ia&s;tics and religious per&s;ons &s;hall be pre&s;erved, together with every thing thereupon belonging, whether they be &s;ituated without or within the town. The mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;hall have liberty of pa&s;&s;ing from place to place, and &s;hall find, under the Engli&s;h flag, the &s;ame protection as under the French flag.</P>
<P N="3">III. Not only the buildings and hou&s;es belonging to pri|vate per&s;ons, whether lay|men, or eccle&s;ia&s;tics, or reli|gious per&s;ons, &s;hall be left in the condition they are, but al&s;o the buildings be|longing to the company, as well as the fort, the ware|hou&s;es, and the walls of the town, with all the fortifica|tions, until the date of the&s;e la&s;t, that is to &s;ay, every thing of this kind, belonging to the company, &s;hall be de|cided by the two re&s;pective courts.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The papers of the re|gi&s;try and notary office, on which depend the fortunes of the inhabitants, &s;hall be &s;ent to France, without any ob|&s;tacle, by &s;uch conveyances as they &s;hall think fit, who are now charged with them, and in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion they &s;hall, in the mean time, re|main.</P>
<P N="5">V. The treatment, herein before &s;tipulated by the fir&s;t article, for the inhabitants of Pondicherry, &s;hall be ex|tended to all the members of the council, company's agents, officers &s;ettled in the &s;ame town, and all others, who have been, or now are, in the &s;ervice of the com|pany; and &s;o in like man|ner to the merchants, whether Armenians, or of any other nation &s;ettled heretofore in Pondicherry for their trade.</P>

It may be doubted, however, whether colonel Coote, with all his &s;pirit, vigi|lance, and military talents, could have &s;ucceeded in this enterprize, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;quadron, which co-operated with him by &s;ea, and effectually excluded all &s;uccours from the be&s;ieged. It mu&s;t be owned, for the honour of the &s;ervice, that no incident interrupted the good under&s;tand|ing

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> which was maintained between the land and &s;ea officers, who vied with each other in contri|buting their utmo&s;t efforts towards the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition. On the twenty-fifth day of De|cember rear-admiral Steevens arrived with four &s;hips of the line, having parted with rear-admiral Corni&s;h and his divi&s;ion in &s;tormy weather: but he joined them at Pondicherry before the place was &s;urrendered.&mdash;On the fir&s;t day of January a violent tempe&s;t obliged admiral Steevens to &s;lip his cables and put to &s;ea, where he parted with the re&s;t of his &s;quadron; and when in three days he returned to the road of Pondicherry, he had the mortification to find that his divi&s;ion had &s;uf|fered &s;everely from the &s;torm. The &s;hips of war called the Duke of Acquitaine and the Sunderland foundered in the &s;torm, and their crews peri&s;hed: The Newca&s;tle, the Queenborough, and Protector fire&s;hip, were driven on &s;hore and de&s;troyed; but the men were &s;aved, together with the cannon, &s;tores, and provi&s;ions. Many other &s;hips &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage, which, however, was &s;oon repaired. Admiral Steevens having intercepted the letter in&s;erted above from Lally to Raymond, immediately di&s;patched letters to the Dutch and Dani&s;h &s;ettlements on this coa&s;t, intimating, that notwith&s;tanding the in&s;inuations of general Lally, he had eleven &s;ail of the line, with two frigates, under his command, all fit for &s;ervice, in the road of Pondicherry, which was clo&s;ely inve&s;ted and blockaded both by &s;ea and land.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of George II. king of Eng|land.</NOTE> While the arms of Great Britain &s;till pro&s;pered in every effort tending to the real intere&s;t of the nation, an event happened which, for a moment, ob&s;cured the &s;plendour of her triumphs; and could not but be very alarming to tho&s;e G&mdash;n allies, whom her liberality had enabled to maintain an ex|pen&s;ive and &s;anguinary war of humour and ambition. On the twenty-fifth day of October, George II. king of Great Britain, without any previous di&s;order, was in the morning &s;uddenly &s;eized with the agony of death, at the palace at Ken&s;ington. He had ri&s;en at his u&s;ual hour, drank his chocolate, and in|quired about the wind, as anxious for the arrival of the foreign mails; then he opened a window of his apartment, and perceiving the weather was &s;erene, declared he would walk in the garden. In a few minutes after this declaration, while he remained alone in his chamber, he fell down upon the floor: the noi&s;e of his fall brought his at|tendants into the room, who lifted him on the bed, where he de&s;ired in a faint voice that the prince&s;s Amelia might be called; but before &s;he could reach the apartment he had expired. An attempt was made to bleed him, but without ef|fect; and indeed his malady was far beyond the reach of art; for when the cavity of the thorax or che&s;t was opened, and in&s;pected by the &s;erjeant &s;urgeons, they found the right ventricle of the heart actually ruptured, and a great quantity of blood di&s;charged through the aperture into the

The ca&s;e however was &s;o extraordinary&punc; that we que&s;tion whether there is &s;uch another in&s;tance upon record.&mdash;A rupture of this nature appears the more remarkable, as it happened to a prince of a healthy con&s;titution, unaccu&s;tomed to exce&s;s, and far advanced beyond that period of life when the blood might be &s;uppo&s;ed to flow with a dangerous impetuo&s;ity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of that prince.</NOTE> Thus died George II. at the age of &s;eventy-&s;even, after a long reign of thirty four years, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a variety of important events, and chequered with a vici&s;&s;itude of character and fortune. He was in his per&s;on rather lower than the middle &s;ize, well &s;haped, erect, with eyes remarkably prominent, a high no&s;e, and fair com|plexion. In his di&s;po&s;ition he is &s;aid to have been ha&s;ty, prone to anger, e&s;pecially in his youth, yet &s;oon appea&s;ed; otherwi&s;e mild, moderate, and humane; in his way of living temperate, regu|lar, and &s;o methodical in every branch of private oeconomy, that his attention de&s;cended to objects which a great king (perhaps) had better over|look. He was fond of military pomp and parade; and per&s;onally brave. He loved war as a &s;oldier; he &s;tudied it as a &s;cience; and corre&s;ponded on the &s;ubject with &s;ome of the greate&s;t officers whom Germany had produced. The extent of his under|&s;tanding, and the &s;plendour of his virtue, we &s;hall not pre&s;ume to a&s;certain, nor attempt to di&s;play;&mdash;we rather wi&s;h for opportunities to ex|patiate on his munificence and liberality; his ge|nerous

With re&s;pect to his government, it very &s;eldom deviated from the in&s;titutions of law; or en|croached upon private property; or interfered with the common admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. The cir|cum&s;tances that chiefly mark his public charac|ter, were a predilection for his native country, and a clo&s;e attention to the political intere&s;ts of the Germanic body: points and principles to which he adhered with the mo&s;t invincible for|titude; and, if ever the blood and trea&s;ure of Great Britain were &s;acrificed to the&s;e con&s;idera|tions, we ought not &s;o much to blame the prince who acted from the dictates of natural affection, as we &s;hould dete&s;t a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ve&mdash;I m&mdash;rs, all of whom in their turns devoted them&s;elves, &s;oul and body, to the gratification of this pa&s;&s;ion, or partiality, &s;o prejudicial to the true intere&s;t of their country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Recapitu|lation of the prin|cipal events of his reign.</NOTE> The reign of George II. produced many revo|lutions, as well in the internal &s;chemes of oecono|my and admini&s;tration, as in the external projects of political connexions; revolutions that expo&s;ed the frailties of human nature, and demon&s;trated the in&s;tability of &s;y&s;tems founded upon conve|nience. In the cour&s;e of this reign a &s;tanding army was, by dint of mini&s;terial influence, in|grafted on the con&s;titution of Great Britain.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> corruption, contrived to &s;ecure a con&s;tant majo|rity in p&mdash;t, was overturned, and the inven|tor of it obliged to quit the reins of govern|ment. Profe&s;&s;ed patriots re&s;igned the principles which they had long endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h, and li&s;ted them&s;elves for the defence of that for|tre&s;s again&s;t which their zeal and talents had been levelled. The management of a mighty kingdom was con&s;igned into the hands of a motley admi|ni&s;tration, mini&s;ters without knowledge, and men without integrity, who&s;e councils were timid, weak, and wavering; who&s;e folly and extrava|gance expo&s;ed the nation to ridicule and contempt; by who&s;e ignorance and pre&s;umption it was reduced to the verge of ruin. The kingdom was engaged in a quarrel truly national, and commenced a ne|ce&s;&s;ary war on national principles; but that war was &s;tarved, and the chief &s;trength of the nation transferred to the continent of Europe, in order to maintain an unnece&s;&s;ary war, in favour of a family who&s;e pride and ambition can be equalled by nothing but its in&s;olence and ingratitude. While the &s;trength of the nation was thus exerted abroad for the &s;upport of worthle&s;s allies, and a dangerous rebellion raged in the bowels of the kingdom, the &s;&mdash;n was in&s;ulted by his m&mdash;rs, who de&s;erted his &s;ervice at that critical juncture, and refu&s;ed to re&s;ume their functions, until he had truckled to their petulant humour, and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed a favourite &s;ervant, of who&s;e &s;uperior ta|lents they were meanly jealous. Such an unpre|cedented &s;ece&s;&s;ion at any time would have merited the imputation of in&s;olence; but at that period,
<PB N="115" REF="1160">
when their &s;&mdash;n was perplexed and embarra&s;&s;ed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> by a variety of dangers and difficulties; when his crown, and even his life, was at &s;take, to throw up their places, abandon his councils, and as far as in them lay, detach them&s;elves from his for|tune; was a &s;tep &s;o likely to aggravate the di&s;|order of the nation; &s;o big with cruelty, ingra|titude, and &s;&mdash;n, that it &s;eems to de&s;erve an appellation which, however, we do not think pro|per to be&s;tow. An inglorious war was &s;ucceeded by an ignominious p&mdash;ce, which proved of &s;hort duration; yet in this interval the Engl &s;h nation exhibited &s;uch a proof of commercial opulence, as a&s;toni&s;hed all Europe. At the clo&s;e of a war which had drained it of &s;o much trea&s;ure, and in|crea&s;ed the public debt to an enormous burden, it acquie&s;ced under &s;uch a reduction of intere&s;t as one would hardly think the mini&s;try dur&s;t have propo&s;ed, even before one half of the national debt was contracted.</P>
<P>A much more unpopular &s;tep was a law that pa&s;&s;ed for naturalizing the Jews; a law &s;o odious to the people in general, that it was &s;oon repealed, at the reque&s;t of that m&mdash;r by whom it had been chiefly patronized. An ill-concerted peace was in a little time productive of fre&s;h ho&s;tilities and an|other war with France, which Britain began to pro&s;ecute under unfavourable au&s;pices. Then the whole political &s;y&s;tem of G&mdash;y was inverted. The k&mdash;of E&mdash;d abandoned the intere&s;t of that hou&s;e which he had in the former war &s;o warmly e&s;pou&s;ed, and took into his bo&s;om a p&mdash;e whom he had formerly con&s;idered as his inveterate

The unpropitious beginning of this war again&s;t France being imputed to the mi&s;conduct of the ad&mdash;n, excited &s;uch a ferment among the people as &s;eemed to threaten a dangerous in|&s;urrection. Every part of the kingdom re&s;ounded with the voice of di&s;&s;atisfaction, which did not even re&s;pect the throne. The k&mdash;g found him&s;elf obliged to accept of a m&mdash;r pre&s;ented by the people, and this mea&s;ure was attended with con&s;e|quences as favourable as his wi&s;h could form. From that in&s;tant all clamour was hu&s;hed; all op|po&s;ition cea&s;ed. The enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of the new mini&s;ter &s;eemed to diffu&s;e it&s;elf through all the operations of the war; and conque&s;t every where attended the efforts of the Briti&s;h arms. Now appeared the fallacy of tho&s;e maxims, and the fal&s;hood of tho&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, by which former mini&s;ters had e&s;tabli&s;hed and endeavoured to ex|cu&s;e the practices of c&mdash;n. The &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;|affection, which had been in&s;i&s;ted on as the &s;ource of parliamentary oppo&s;ition, now intirely vani&s;hed; nor was it found nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e &s;ini&s;ter means for &s;ecuring a majority, in order to an&s;wer the pur|po&s;es of the admini&s;tration.

A thou&s;and pens were drawn to paint the beauties and &s;ublimity of his character, in poetry as well as pro&s;e.

The &s;ame panegyric and pathos appeared in all the addre&s;&s;es, with which every other community in the kingdom approached the throne of our pre&s;ent &s;overeign; in&s;omuch that we may venture to &s;ay, no prince was ever more popu|lar at the time of his decea&s;e. The Engli&s;h are na|turally warm and impetuous; and, in generous natures, affection is as apt as any other pa&s;&s;ion to run riot. The &s;udden death of the king was la|mented as a national misfortune by many, who felt a truly filial affection for their country; not that they implicitly &s;ub&s;cribed to all the exagge|rated prai&s;e which had been &s;o liberally poured forth on his character; but becau&s;e the nation was deprived of him at a critical juncture, while in|volved in a dangerous and expen&s;ive war, of which he had been per&s;onally the chief mover and &s;up|port. They knew the burden of royalty devolved upon a young prince, who, though heir apparent to the crown, and already arrived at the years of maturity, had never been admitted to any &s;hare of the admini&s;tration, nor made acquainted with any &s;chemes or &s;ecrets of &s;tate. The real character of the new king was very little known to the gene|rality of the nation. They dreaded an abrupt change of mea&s;ures, which might have rendered u&s;ele&s;s all the advantages obtained in the cour&s;e of the war. As they were ignorant of his connexions, they dreaded a revolution in the mini&s;try, which might fill the kingdom with clamour and confu|&s;ion.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the com|merce of Great Britain.</NOTE> The commerce of Great Britain continued to increa&s;e during the whole cour&s;e of this reign; but this increa&s;e was not the effect of extraordinary encouragement. On the contrary, the nece&s;&s;ities of government, the growing expences of the na|tion, and the continual augmentation of the pub|lic debt, obliged the legi&s;lature to hamper trade with manifold and grievous impo&s;itions: its in|crea&s;e, therefore, mu&s;t have been owing to the na|tural progre&s;s of indu&s;try and adventure, extend|ing them&s;elves to that farthe&s;t line or limit be|yond which they will not be able to advance: when the tide of traffick has flowed to its highe&s;t mark, it will then begin to recede in a gradual ebb, until it is &s;hrunk within the narrow limits of its original channel. War, which naturally im|pedes the traffick of other nations, has opened new &s;ources to the merchants of Great Britain: the &s;uperiority of her naval power hath cru&s;hed the navigation of France, her great rival in com|merce; &s;o that &s;he now &s;upplies, on her own

Thus her trade is augmented to a &s;ur|pri&s;ing pitch; and this great augmentation alone has enabled her to maintain the war at &s;uch an enormous expence. As this advantage will cea&s;e when the French are at liberty to re-e&s;tabli&s;h their commerce, and pro&s;ecute it without mole&s;tation, it would be for the intere&s;t of Great Britian to be at continual variance with that re&s;tle&s;s neighbour, provided the conte&s;t could be limited to the ope|rations of a &s;ea-war, in which England would be always invincible and victorious. Foreign nations will doubtle&s;s be &s;urpri&s;ed to learn, that above eight thou&s;and &s;hips are employed by the traders of Great Britain; and that the produce of the &s;ink|ing fund, which is the overplus produced by all the different funds appropriated to defray the in|tere&s;t of the national debt, exceeds annually three millions &s;terling.</P>

<P>The clergy of Great Britain were generally learned, pious, and exemplary. Sherlock, Hoad|ley, Secker, and Conybeare, were promoted to the fir&s;t dignities of the church.

But the&s;e promotions were granted to rea&s;ons of &s;tate convenience, and per&s;onal intere&s;t, rather than as rewards of extraordinary merit. Many other eccle&s;ia&s;tics of worth and learning were totally overlooked. Nor was eccle&s;ia&s;tical merit confined to the e&s;tabli&s;hed church.

<P>Fanatici&s;m al&s;o formed a league with fal&s;e phi|lo&s;ophy. One Hutchin&s;on, a vi&s;ionary, intoxi|cated with the fumes of Rabbinical learning, pre|tended to deduce all demon&s;tration from Hebrew roots, and to confine all human knowledge to the five books of Mo&s;es. His di&s;ciples became nu|merous after his death. With the methodi&s;ts, they denied the merit of good works; and bitterly inveighed again&s;t Newton as an ignorant preten|der, who had pre&s;umed to &s;et up his own ridi|culous chimaeras in oppo&s;ition to the &s;acred philo|&s;ophy of the Pentateuch. But the mo&s;t extraordi|nary &s;ect which di&s;tingui&s;hed this reign was that of the Moravians, or Hernhutters, imported from Germany by count Zinzendorf, who might have been termed the Melchizedec of his followers, in|a&s;much as he a&s;&s;umed among them the three-fold character of prophet, prie&s;t, and king. They could not be &s;o properly &s;tlled a &s;ect as the di&s;ci|ples of an original, who had invented a new &s;y&s;tem of religion. Their chief adoration was payed to the Second Per&s;on in the Trinity: the Fir&s;t they treated with the mo&s;t &s;hocking neglect. Some of their tenets were bl&mdash;s, &s;ome indecent, and others ridiculou&s;ly ab&s;urd. Their di&s;cipline was a &s;trange mixture of devotion and impurity. Their exterior wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ted of hymns, prayers, and
<PB N="123" REF="1240">
&s;ermons; the hymns extremely ludicrous, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An, 1760.</NOTE> often indecent, alluding to the &s;ide hole or wound which Chri&s;t received from a &s;pear in his &s;ide, while he remained upon the cro&s;s. Their &s;ermons frequently contained very gro&s;s incentives to the work of propagation. Their private exerci&s;es are &s;aid to have abounded with &s;uch rites and my&s;te|ries as we cannot explain, with any regard to deco|rum. They pro&s;e&s;&s;ed a community of goods; and were governed as one family, in temporals as well as &s;pirituals, by a council, or kind of pre&s;by|tery, in which the count, as their ordinary, pre|&s;ided. In ca&s;es of doubt, or great con&s;equence, the&s;e pretended to con&s;ult the Saviour, and to decide from immediate in&s;piration; &s;o that they boa&s;ted of being under the immediate direction of a Theocracy; though, in fact, they were &s;laves to the mo&s;t dangerous kind of de&s;poti&s;m: for as often as any individual of the community pre&s;umed to think for him&s;elf, or differ in opinion from the ordinary and his band of a&s;&s;ociates, the oracle de|creed, that he &s;hould be in&s;tantly &s;ent upon the mi&s;&s;ion which they had fixed in Greenland, or to the colony they had e&s;tabli&s;hed in Pen&s;ylvania. As the religioni&s;ts con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of manufac|turers, who appeared very &s;ober, orderly, and in|du&s;trious; and their chief declared his intention of pro&s;ecuting works of public emolument, they obtained a &s;ettlement under a parliamentary &s;anc|tion in England, where they &s;oon made a con&s;i|derable number of pro&s;elytes, before their princi|ples were fully di&s;covered and explained.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> Many ingenious treati&s;es on metaphy&s;ics and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Metaphy|&s;ics and Medicine.</NOTE> morality appeared in the cour&s;e of this reign; and a philo&s;ophical &s;pirit of inquiry diffu&s;ed it&s;elf to the furthe&s;t extremities of the united kingdom. Tho' few di&s;coveries of importance were made in medicine, yet that art was well under&s;tood in all its differ|ent branches; and many of its profe&s;&s;ors di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves in other provinces of litera|ture. Be&s;ides the medical e&s;&s;ays of London and Edinburgh, the phy&s;ician's library was enriched with many u&s;eful modern productions; with the works of the cla&s;&s;ical Friend, the elegant Mead, the accurate Huxham, and the philo&s;ophical Prin|gle. The art of midwifery was elucidated by &s;cience, reduced to fixed principles, and almo&s;t wholly con&s;igned into the hands of men practi|tioners. The re&s;earches of anatomy were pro&s;e|cuted to &s;ome curious di&s;coveries by the inge|nuity and dexterity of a Hunter and a Monro. The numerous ho&s;pitals in London contributed to the improvement of &s;urgery, which was brought to perfection under the au&s;pices of a Che&s;elden and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Agricul|ture.</NOTE> a Sharpe.

Thus many of the Engli&s;h manufactures, being found &s;light and un&s;erviceable, grew into di&s;credit abroad; thus the art of producing them more perfect, may in time be totally lo&s;t at home. The cloths now made in England, are inferior in texture and fabric to tho&s;e which were manufac|tured in the beginning of the century; and the &s;ame judgment may be pronounced upon al|mo&s;t every article of hardware. The razors, knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, hatchets, &s;words, and other edge uten&s;ils, perpared for exportation, are ge|nerally ill-tempered, half-fini&s;hed, flawed or brit|tle; and the mu&s;quets, which are &s;old for &s;even or eight &s;hillings a-piece to the exporter, &s;o carele&s;ly and uncon&s;cientiou&s;ly prepared, they can|not be u&s;ed without imminent danger of mutila|tion; accordingly one hardly meets with a ne|gro man upon the coa&s;t of Guinea, in the neigh|bourhood of the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements, who has not been wounded or maimed in &s;ome member, by the bur&s;ting of the Engli&s;h fire-arms.

Thom&s;on, the poet of the Sea&s;ons, di&s;played a luxuriancy of genius in de&s;cribing the beauties of nature. Aken|&s;ide and Arm&s;trong excelled in didactic poetry. Even the Epopoea did not di&s;dain an Engli&s;h dre&s;s, but appeared to advantage in the Leonidas of Glover, and the Epigoniad of Wilkie. The public acknowledged a con&s;iderable &s;hare of dra|matic merit in the tragedies of Young, Mallet, Home, and &s;ome other le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed authors. Very few regular comedies, during this period, were exhibited on the Engli&s;h theatre, which, however, produced many le&s;s laboured pieces, abounding with &s;atire, wit, and humour. The Carele&s;s Hu&s;band of Cibber, and Su&s;picious Hu&s;|band of Hoadley, are the only very modern comedies that bid fair for reaching po&s;terity. The exhibitions of the &s;tage were improved to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite entertainment, by the talents and management of Garrick, who greatly &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed all his predece&s;&s;ors of this, and perhaps every other nation, in his genius for acting; in the &s;weetne&s;s and variety of his tones; the irre|&s;i&s;tible magic of his eye; the fire and vivacity of his action: the elegance of attitude; and the whole pathos of expre&s;&s;ion. Quin excelled in dignity and declamation; as well as in exhi|biting &s;ome characters of humour, equally ex|qui&s;ite and peculiar. Cibber breathed the whole &s;oul of female tenderne&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion; and Prit|chard di&s;played all the dignity of di&s;tre&s;s. That

Candidates for literary fame appeared even in the higher &s;phere of life, embelli&s;hed by the ner|vous &s;tile, &s;uperior &s;en&s;e, and exten&s;ive erudition of a Corke; by the delicate ta&s;te, the poli&s;hed mu&s;e, and tender feelings of a Lyttleton. King &s;hone unrivalled in Roman eloquence. Even the female &s;ex di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their ta&s;te and ingenuity. Mi&s;s Carter rivalled the cele|brated Dacier in learning and critical knowledge; and Mrs. Lennox &s;ignalized her&s;elf by many &s;uc|ce&s;sful efforts of genius, both in poetry and pro&s;e. The genius of Cervantes was transfu&s;ed into the novels of Fielding, who painted the characters, and ridiculed the follies of life with equal &s;trength, humour, and propriety. The field of hi&s;tory and biography was cultivated by many writers of ability, among whom we di&s;tingui&s;h the copious Guthrie, the circum&s;tantial Ralph, the laborious Carte, the learned and elegant Robert&s;on, and above all the ingenious, penetrating, and com|prehen&s;ive Hume, whom we rank among the fir&s;t writers of the age, both as an hi&s;torian and philo&s;o|pher. Nor let us forget the merit con&s;picuous in the works of Campbell, remarkable for candour, intelligence, and preci&s;ion.

The laudable aim of inli&s;t|ing the pa&s;&s;ions on the &s;ide of virtue, was &s;uc|ce&s;sfully pur&s;ued by Richard&s;on, in his Pamela, Clari&s;&s;a, and Grandi&s;on; a &s;pecies of writing equal|ly new and extraordinary, where, mingled with much &s;uperfluity and impertinence, we find a &s;u|blime &s;y&s;tem of ethics, and amazing knowledge, and command of human nature. Many of the Greek and Roman cla&s;&s;ics made their appearance in Engli&s;h tran&s;lations, which were favourably received as works of merit; among the&s;e we place, after Pope's Homer, Virgil by Pitt and Warton, Horace by Francis, Polybius by Hamp|ton, and Sophocles by Francklyn. The war in|troduced a variety of military treati&s;es, chiefly tran&s;lated from the French language; and a free country like Great Britain, will always abound with political tracts and lucubrations. Every lite|rary production of merit, calculated for amu&s;e|ment or in&s;truction, that appeared in any country or language of Chri&s;tendom, was immediately imported, and naturalized among the Engli&s;h people. Never was the pur&s;uit after knowledge &s;o univer&s;al, literary merit more regarded, than at this juncture by the body of the Briti&s;h nation; but it was honoured by no attention from the throne, and little indulgence did it reap from the liberality of particular patrons.

Hud&s;on, Reynolds, and Ram&s;ay, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their &s;uperior merit in portraits; a branch that was &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated by many other Engli&s;h painters. Wooton was famous for repre&s;enting live animals in general; Seymour for race hor&s;es; Lambert, and the Smiths, for land&s;chape; and Scot for &s;ea-pieces. Several &s;pirited attempts were made on hi&s;torical &s;ub|jects; but little progre&s;s was made on the &s;u|blime parts of painting. E&s;&s;ays of this kind were di&s;couraged by a fal&s;e ta&s;te, founded upon a reprobation of Briti&s;h genius. The art of en|graving was brought to perfection by Strange, and laudably practi&s;ed by &s;everal other ma&s;ters; and great improvements were made in mezzo|tinto, miniature, and enamel. Many fair monu|ments of &s;culpture or &s;tatuary were rai&s;ed by Ry&s;bach, Roubilliac, and Wilton. Architecture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&s;culpture.</NOTE> which had been cheri&s;hed by the elegant ta&s;te of a Burlington, &s;oon became a favourite &s;tudy; and many magnificent edifices were reared in different parts of the kingdom. Ornaments were carved in wood, and moulded in &s;tucco,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> with all the delicacy of execution; but a pa&s;|&s;ion for novelty had introduced into gardening, building, and furniture, an ab&s;urd ta&s;te, equally void of beauty and convenience. Improvements in the liberal and u&s;eful arts, will doubtle&s;s be the con&s;equence of that encouragement given to merit by the &s;ociety in&s;tituted for the&s;e pur|po&s;es, which we have de&s;cribed on another oc|ca&s;ion. As for the Royal Society, it &s;eems to have degenerated in its re&s;earches, and to have had very little &s;hare for half a century at lea&s;t, in extending the influence of true philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this reign with a detail of the forces and fleets of Great Britain, from whence the reader will conceive a ju&s;t idea of her opulence and power.</P>

<P>From the foregoing li&s;t of &s;ea and land forces it plainly appears, that Great Britain, on her own element, is more than a match for all the maritime powers of Europe, &s;hould they combine to her prejudice. Nothing, therefore, could be more impolitical in the conduct of any neutral &s;tate, ambi|tious of naval commerce, than to involve it&s;elf in a war, as the a&s;&s;ociate or auxiliary to the enemies of England; becau&s;e it would nece&s;&s;arily forfeit the advantages of neutrality, and, in all human probability, &s;ee its infant navigation immediately de&s;troyed. This would certainly be the fate of Spain, &s;hould &s;he precipitately e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of the other branch of the hou&s;e of Bourbon; for, granting it was in her power to reinforce the French navy with thirty &s;ail of the line, the com|bined

The &s;ame proclamation was repeated with the u&s;ual &s;olemnities in different parts of the metropolis, which re&s;ounded with joy and acclamations. To the council, a&s;&s;embled at Carleton&punc;hou&s;e, the king addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the&s;e words: <Q>&startq;The lo&s;s that I and the nation have &s;u&s;|tained by the death of the king my grand|father, would have been &s;everely felt at any time; but coming at &s;o critical a juncture, and &s;o unexpected, it is by many circum&s;tances aug|mented; and the weight now falling upon me, much increa&s;ed, I feel my own in&s; f$ciency to &s;upport it as I wi&s;h: but, animated by the ten|dere&s;t affection for this my native country, and depending on the advice, experience, and abi|lities

Another proclamation was i&s;&s;ued for the encouragement of piety and virtue, and for pre|venting and puni&s;hing vice, prophanene&s;s, and im|morality. The tide of affection towards the young monarch began to run &s;o high, that addre&s;&s;es, couched in the warme&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of love and at|tachment, flowed in from every part of the king|dom. The magi&s;trates of London led the way; and their example was followed by the merchants and traders of that city, amounting to &s;uch a number as had never before appeared on the like occa&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Though it would be &s;uperfluous to in&s;ert tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es, which contain no|thing very remarkable, the reader will not be di&s;gu&s;ted to &s;ee the following letter, written to the king by the bi&s;hop of London; a letter fraught with good &s;en&s;e, pie|ty, and affection, in all re|&s;pects worthy of the charac|ter of that aged and vene|rable prelate.</P>

<SALUTE>"SIRE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"Amid&s;t the congratu|lations that &s;urround the throne, permit me to lay before your maje&s;ty a heart, which, though oppre&s;&s;ed with age and infirmity, is no &s;tranger to the joys of my country.</P>
<P>When the melancholy news of the late king's demi&s;e reached us, it naturally led us to con&s;ider the lo&s;s we had &s;u&s;tained, and upon what our hopes of futurity depended. The fir&s;t part excited grief, and put all the tender pa&s;|&s;ions into motion; but the &s;econd brought life and &s;pirit with it, and wiped away the tear; from every face.</P>
<P>Oh! how graciou&s;ly did the providence of God provide a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, able to bear the weight of government in that unexpected event.</P>
<P>You, Sir, are the per&s;on whom the people ardently de&s;ire; which affection of theirs is happily returned, by your maje&s;ty's declared con|cern for their pro&s;perity, and let nothing di&s;turb this mu|tual con&s;$nt. Let there be but one conte&s;t between them, whether the king loves the people be&s;t, or the people him: and may it be a long, a very long conte&s;t; may it never be decided, but let it remain doubtful; and may the paternal affection on the one &s;ide, and the filial obe|dience on the other, be had in perpetual remembrance.</P>
<P>This will probably be the la&s;t time I &s;hall ever trouble your maje&s;ty. I beg leave to expre&s;s my warme&s;t wi&s;hes and prayers on your behalf. May the God of heaven and earth have you always under his protection, and direct you to &s;eek his honour and glory in all you do; and may you reap the benefit of it by an increa&s;e of happine&s;s in this world, and in the next."</P>
<P>We &s;hall al&s;o indulge the public with the addre&s;s of the Quakers, who, in man|ners, diction, and turn of thinking, &s;eem to be a &s;pe|cies di&s;tinct from the ordina|nary race of men.</P>

<P>"Deeply afflicted with the &s;udden and &s;orrowful event, that leads our fellow &s;ubjects with condolance to the throne, we beg leave to expre&s;s the &s;ympathy we feel on this af|flicting occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tly &s;en&s;ible of the fa|vour and protection we have enjoyed during the late mild and happy reign, and im|pre&s;&s;ed with the warme&s;t &s;en|timents of duty and grati|tude to our decea&s;ed &s;ove|reign, we pay this tribute of unaffected grief to the me|mory of the father and the friend of his people.</P>
<P>We have abundant rea&s;on to acknowledge the goodne&s;s of Almighty God, for con|tinuing to this period a life of &s;uch importance to the wel$are of the&s;e kingdoms; a period, when we behold a prince, endowed with quali|ties that add lu&s;tre to a crown, formed by tuition and example to protect the li|berties of his people, a&s;cend|ing the Briti&s;h throne, and, in the earlie&s;t acts of power, giving the mo&s;t ample de|mon&s;trations of his royal re|gard for piety and virtue.</P>
<P>Ever faithful and zealou&s;ly affected to thy illu&s;trious hou&s;e, though differing in &s;entiments and conduct from others of our fellow &s;ubjects, we embrace this opportunity to crave thy indulgence and protection: and beg leave to a&s;&s;ure the king, that our di&s;|&s;ent proceeds not from a con|tumacious di&s;regard to the laws, to cu&s;tom, or authori|ty, but from motives to us purely con&s;cientious.</P>
<P>The &s;ame religious prin|ciple that produces this di&s;|&s;$nt, we tru&s;t, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will continue to engage us, as it always hath done &s;ince we were a people, to exert whatever influence we may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, in promoting the fear of God, the honour of the king, and the pro&s;perity of his &s;ubjects. May the Almighty ble&s;s thy endeavours to put a &s;top to the effu&s;ion of blood, and render thee the happy in&s;tru|ment of re&s;toring peace and tranquillity. May &s;acred and unerring wi&s;dom ever be thy guide, adorn thee with every virtue, and crown thee with every ble&s;&s;ing, that future ages may commemorate the happi|ne&s;s of thy reign with grateful admiration.</P>

<P>How much &s;oever the king might have di&s;ap|proved of tho&s;e mea&s;ures which had involved the nation in &s;uch an expen&s;ive war on the continent of Europe, affairs were &s;o &s;ituated, that he could not abruptly renounce that &s;y&s;tem of politics, with any regard to the dignity of his crown, or to the honour of the public faith, which was in &s;ome mea&s;ure engaged to &s;upport the German allies of Great Britain.

<PB N="156" REF="1590">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> Pru&s;&s;ian monarch, delivered and printed by his mi|ni&s;ter at London during the late war, importing, That as no German prince has a right to meddle with the internal policy of Great Britain, nor with the con&s;titution of its government, he had rea&s;on to hope the Engli&s;h nation would not meddle with the dome&s;tic affairs of the empire; more e&s;pecially as England had no rea&s;on to interfere in this quar|rel from any con&s;ideration of commerce, or other|wi&s;e: and granting that England &s;hould be more favourably inclined towards one German court than to another, yet he thought it too unrea&s;onable to pretend that &s;uch powerful and re&s;pectable princes, as tho&s;e of the empire are, &s;hould be obliged to regulate their conduct according to the inclinations of tho&s;e among the Engli&s;h, who &s;trive to involve their countrymen in foreign quarrels, that are of no manner of concern to England. He begins with a comparative view of the &s;trength of France and England; and undeniably proves, that France is by far the mo&s;t powerful in the number of men, in the greatne&s;s of revenue, and the variety of re|&s;ources: every mea&s;ure, therefore, which has a tendency to unite the powers of Europe, among them&s;elves, and again&s;t France, mu&s;t be for the general advantage of Europe, and the particular intere&s;t of Great Britain; and every mea&s;ure tend|ing to &s;et the &s;tates of Germany, Holland, and England, either at war with each other, or among them&s;elves, mu&s;t be calculated for the advantage of France, and the prejudice of the other Eu|ropean powers. Of con&s;equence, whenever &s;uch wars &s;hall break out between any two &s;tates of Eu|rope,

To tho&s;e who plead the nece&s;&s;ity of preventing France from making a conque&s;t of Hanover he replies that an electorate of the em|pire cannot be annihilated but by the de&s;truction of the whole Germanic con&s;titution; and &s;hould a king of France &s;eize Hanover, and eject a whole family from its rights, every member of the em|pire, even Sweden and Denmark, would take the alarm, and ri&s;e up again&s;t &s;uch an act of violence: it were therefore to be wi&s;hed, that France &s;hould attempt to hold &s;uch a precarious conque&s;t, that all Germany might be united again&s;t her encroaching power.

he might have enjoyed the benefit of a neu+trality.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> He affirmed, it was not with a view to oppre&s;s the Hanoverians that the French pene|trated into We&s;tphalia; but becau&s;e they knew the Engli&s;h would meet them there, and fight them at &s;uch a di&s;advantage as might ballance all the &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms in every other part of the world. The French have no other country in which they can act again&s;t the power of Eng|land. They cannot invade Great Britain: if they could, not a regiment would be &s;ent into We&s;t|phalia. They have neither tran&s;ports to convey, nor a navy to protect their troops in the pa&s;&s;age to any part of America, Africa, or the Ea&s;t Indies: they mu&s;t therefore either remain at home unem|ployed, or be &s;ent into Germany; and &s;urely while they are prevented from invading the Briti&s;h dominions, and all their i&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies lie expo&s;ed to the attempts of the Engli&s;h, they could not wi&s;h for a more effectual diver&s;ion than that of transferring the war into Germany, where the utmo&s;t endeavours of the Briti&s;h nation &s;erve only to entail mi&s;ery on that electorate which it at|tempts to defend; and to exhau&s;t tho&s;e trea&s;ures, which, if applied to the purpo&s;es of a truly Briti&s;h war, would infallibly complete the conque&s;t of every &s;ettlement po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by France in America; con&s;equently cut off that ambitious power from the chief &s;ource of its wealth and commerce.

Over and above this revenue, the &s;tate hath borrowed twelve mil|lions for the &s;ervice of the year.

The Engli&s;h navy for this year, co&s;ts five millions &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds, though never employed in any actual &s;ervice: France equipped no fleet during the cour&s;e of this year; &s;o that the difference of expence, in this particular, reduces the funds of the two nations, with re&s;pect to the land war, to nine and ten millions.

He takes notice, that a war of de|fence

is much more difficult than a war of offence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> becau&s;e it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to defend a large extent of country from an enterpri&s;ing enemy of &s;uperior number: that the French have every year brought a &s;uperiority of number into the field, and every &s;ummer penetrated into He&s;&s;e and part of Hanover: that whatever force England may &s;end into Germany, France will always &s;end a greater, becau&s;e her troops are much more numerous: that while England, by running yearly ten or twelve millions in debt, is barely able to maintain an army of ninety-five thou&s;and men in Germany, France, with very little addition to her ordinary expence, can pour one hundred and twenty thou&s;and men into the &s;ame country; con&s;equently may protract the war until the credit of Britain &s;hall be entirely bankrupt, as it is pro&s;ecuted in a country where victory can do the Engli&s;h little good, and where a defeat can do the French little harm. Should they lo&s;e one battle, in&s;tead of maintaining their ground on the We&s;er, they will retreat to the Mayne; that is, to a greater di&s;tance from Eng|land, and &s;o much nearer to their own country. Should the Briti&s;h army obtain a &s;econd victory, perhaps their enemies might repa&s;s the Rhine into France, where &s;urely the Engli&s;h would not be &s;o mad as to follow them, or undertake the reduction of their fortified frontier: they would therefore be recruited and reinforced, and return in the next campaign with &s;uperior numbers: but &s;hould the fate of battle turn again&s;t the Briti&s;h arms, they would be obliged to retreat until cut off from all communication with the &s;ea; and, as they could
<PB N="166" REF="1690">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> neither be recruited nor reinforced, mu&s;t at the long&punc;run &s;ubmit to a capitulation. With re&s;pect to the lo&s;s of men, France never maintained a more innocent war; and all the advantages gained over them in Germany have &s;erved only to prevent their reduction of Hanover; but no deci&s;ive &s;troke hath been &s;truck again&s;t them: for, though they have retreated for the pre&s;ent, they have returned every &s;ucceeding campaign with redoubled vigour. What purpo&s;e, therefore, can be an&s;wered by the pro&s;ecution of &s;uch a war, but the deva&s;tation of the territories belonging to the Briti&s;h allies, the accumulation of an enormous debt on the &s;houlders of Great Britain and a deplorable &s;laughter of her brave&s;t &s;ons, who&s;e lives have been &s;quandered away with the mo&s;t &s;avage profu&s;ion, under the direction of a foreigner, whom England could not puni&s;h, nor call to account, even though he had (which &s;urely is not the ca&s;e) made the mo&s;t infamous u&s;e of the power and authority with which he was ve&s;ted? Should Britain, by an ex|traordinary effort, and contracting an additional debt of twenty millions, be able to &s;end a &s;uperior force into Germany, while the French are retired into their own country, this would undoubtedly be the con&s;equence: the enemy would remain at home for that year, and, by &s;aving their troops and their money, provide a better fund for the en&s;u|ing campaign, when England would be exhau&s;ted. At this rate, whatever the &s;ucce&s;s of England may be in Germany, France can never be effectually injured by them: on the contrary, it will be her intere&s;t to keep alive the war in that quarter, as the

<P>After having fatther di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the merits of his P&mdash;n m&mdash;y, re&s;pecting Great Britain, deduced from his conduct towards her, both in the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent war, the author proceeds to inve&s;tigate that great political que&s;tion, whether Britain ought to have any continental connections? He determines in the affirmative. He ob&s;erves, that France is the only enemy upon the continent by which Britain can be endangered; and allows, that whenever the other nations of Europe will unite effectually in a war again&s;t France, it will then be the intere&s;t of England to join in that alliance; but to interfere as a party, or rather as an incendiary, in every quarrel between German princes, to take up the cudgels her&s;elf, and contract enormous debts by borrowing money to pay them for fighting their own quarrels, is &s;uch an ab&s;urdity in politics as one would think no nation could avow. He &s;ays, if king William III. in&s;tead of placing him&s;elf at the head of Eu|rope, and uniting the &s;everal &s;tates of it in arms again&s;t France, had con&s;tituted him&s;elf the chief of a German party, formed petty connections in that country, and involved Great Britain in the in|ternal broils of the empire, the French monarch might have thanked him for adhering to &s;uch a wretched &s;y&s;tem, which no other power of Europe would have joined him in &s;upporting. All the trea&s;ures of England, in that ca&s;e, had been ex|pended to no purpo&s;e; and in the mean time Eu|rope would have been en&s;laved.

The French were op|po&s;ed by different armies of the allies in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Savoy, Germany, and Flanders: they lo&s;t twenty thou&s;and men at the battle of Ra|millies; and a whole army, with half a million of trea&s;ure, at the &s;iege and battle of Turin. For this expence of about two million eight hundred thou|&s;and pounds, advanced by England, the allies were induced to bring two hundred thou&s;and men into the field: but England has this year expended more than double that &s;um in Germany, without being able to produce half the number.</P>
<P>Our &s;en&s;ible author, in the next place, con&s;iders that maxim which has been &s;o &s;trongly inculcated on the public; namely, that the war in Germany is a diver&s;ion in favour of the Engli&s;h. He denies that it is a diver&s;ion either of the forces, or of the trea&s;ures of France. The French forces are em|ployed in a German war; but by no means di|verted from any other &s;ervice by which they could
<PB N="170" REF="1730">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> annoy the Engli&s;h. They may a&s;&s;emble troops on the coa&s;t oppo&s;ite to England; but they have neither &s;hips to tran&s;port them, nor a fleet to pro|tect them in their pa&s;&s;age. Could they find means to throw over ten thou&s;and men by &s;tealth, or even double that number, what rea&s;on could Britain have to fear &s;uch an inva&s;ion&punc; were tho&s;e national troops, which &s;he now maintains in Germany, to the amount of five and twenty thou&s;and men, en|camped or cantoned on the &s;outhern coa&s;t of Eng|land, ready to be reinforced by the re&s;t of the re|gular forces and the militia of Great Britain? Could &s;uch a de&s;cent be effected in &s;pite of all the diffi|culties attending it, which appear almo&s;t in&s;ur|mountable while the Engli&s;h are ma&s;ters at &s;ea; the invaders mu&s;t infallibly be defeated, and even obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion: but, granting &s;uch an attempt was practicable, it would not &s;urely be prevented by their pro&s;ecuting the war in Germany.</P>
<P>The army of France in time of war does not fall &s;hort of three hundred thou&s;and men. About one hundred and twenty thou&s;and are employed in Germany: they have no other enemy to oppo&s;e on the continent of Europe; con&s;equently one hundred and eighty thou&s;and men remain inac|tive, and one half of the&s;e idle men would be more than &s;ufficient to invade Great Britain with a good pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s: they are not there|fore in want of troops; but de&s;titute of the means of conveyance; an undeniable proof that a German war is not a diver&s;ion of the French forces. Neither can it be deemed a divi&s;ion of

their trea&s;ure; becau&s;e their trea&s;ure could not<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> be employed &s;o effectually el&s;ewhere in the annoy|ance of Great Britain. They were very &s;en&s;ible of the advantages they derived from their colo|nies in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, and ju&s;tly con|&s;idered them as the great &s;ource of their wealth, and the chief &s;upport of their marine. They knew that the&s;e &s;ettlements could not be protected again&s;t England, without a formidable fleet and a great number of tran&s;ports, to wa&s;t over occa&s;ional &s;uccours and &s;upplies. If we, therefore, &s;uppo&s;e the French mini&s;try governed by the dictates of true policy, or indeed of common &s;en&s;e, they would have converted their trea&s;ure and their whole endeavours to this, as the mo&s;t important object that could engage their attention, had they not found the ta&s;k altogether impracticable. Their &s;hips were detained in Engli&s;h ports; their &s;ailors in Engli&s;h pri&s;ons. Their fi&s;hery was de&s;troyed; their navigation at an end; and all their principal harbours, both in Europe and America, were blocked up by the &s;quadrons of Great Britain. They might perhaps purcha&s;e &s;hips from the Swedes, Danes, or Genoe&s;e; but as the &s;ea is covered with Eng|li&s;h crui&s;ers, and their ports are be&s;et by the &s;qua|drons of this nation, they would find it a very dif|ficult ta&s;k to a&s;&s;emble a navy; and &s;hould they &s;ucceed in this particular, their &s;hips mu&s;t rot in the harbour; for &s;hips can be of no &s;ervice with|out &s;eamen; and &s;eamen cannot be made but by the practice of navigation. In the beginning of the war, while there was any po&s;&s;ibility of &s;upport|ing their marine, they attended to this object with
<PB N="172" REF="1750">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous care; and while there was any rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of invading England, never dreamed of marching into Germany. The elec|torate of Hanover was &s;o far from being thought in danger, that a body of its troops were brought over for the defence of England. In the &s;equel, when France perceived that Britain was prepared again&s;t in&s;ult; that her own navy was de&s;troyed, and her colonies in danger of being conquered; then &s;he bethought her&s;elf of Germany; and it was &s;he in fact that made the diver&s;ion, in this country; and the German war was, on the part of England, not a war of diver&s;ion, but a war of defence, in favour of a barren electorate, which, if put up to &s;ale, would not fetch one half of the money which is yearly expended in its behalf; for the protection of a country which cannot be pro|tected, who&s;e inhabitants are rendered mi&s;e|rable by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they receive; and for the &s;upport of an ally from whom no mutual &s;ervice can be expected. On the other hand, had one third part of the &s;ums expended in Germany, been employed in giving additional vigour to the naval armaments of Great Britain, France by this time would not have had one &s;ettlement left in the We&s;t Indies: all the profits of her external com|merce mu&s;t have cea&s;ed, and &s;he mu&s;t have been ab&s;olutely obliged to accept &s;uch terms of peace as England &s;hould think proper to impo&s;e. Nay, without any &s;uch additional reinforcement, this con&s;equence mu&s;t have en&s;ued from a &s;pirited u&s;e of that armament which loitered inactive at Port&s;|mouth, until the &s;ea&s;on for action was elap&s;ed.
<PB N="173" REF="1760">
Should Britain per&s;i&s;t in throwing her ineffectual<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> &s;hield before Hanover, it will be the &s;ignal for France to make that electorate the &s;eat of war in every future quarrel. It will be giving up all the advantages of an in&s;ular &s;ituation, and, as it were, chaining Great Britain to the continent, from which &s;he is &s;o happily &s;evered by nature. It is re|nouncing her naval &s;uperiority, and leaving her enemy the choice of a field where di&s;comfiture can do them little harm, and where &s;he her&s;elf mu&s;t be infallibly exhau&s;ted, even by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of her own victories. Three &s;uch victories as tho&s;e of Crevelt, Minden, and Warbourg, though obtained in the cour&s;e of one campaign, could have little or no effect in bringing the war to a termination. The French army would retire to their own terri|tories, and be ready to invade the electorate early in the next campaign. If France, therefore, can maintain the war for little more than the amount of its annual revenue, it can hardly be expected that &s;he will &s;ue for peace the&s;e ten years; before the expiration of which period the national debt of Great Britain will exceed two hundred millions, &s;hould it continue to encrea&s;e eight millions annual|ly. This we conceive to be a very moderate calcula|tion, con&s;idering that above fourteen millions were borrowed for the &s;ervice of the pre&s;ent year; and certainly it mu&s;t afford very melancholy reflections to every lover of his country, who con&s;iders that the Briti&s;h manufactures cannot po&s;&s;ibly bear the load of &s;uch an augmented intere&s;t; and that na|tional bankruptcy mu&s;t be productive of horror, confu&s;ion, anarchy, and ruin.</P>

You may depend upon the faithful and punctual application of what &s;hall be granted. I have ordered the proper e&s;timates for the en|&s;uing year to be laid before you; and al&s;o an account of the extraordinary expences, which,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> from the nature of the different and remote ope|rations, have been unavoidably incurred.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;It is with peculiar reluctance that I am obliged, at &s;uch a time, to mention any thing which per|&s;onally regards my&s;elf. But, as the grant of the greate&s;t part of the civil li&s;t revenues is now de|termined, I tru&s;t in your duty and affection to me, to make the proper provi&s;ion for &s;upport|ing my civil government with honour and dig|nity. On my part, you may be a&s;&s;ured of a re|gular and becoming oeconomy.</Q></P>
<P>"My lords and gentlemen,</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;The eyes of all Europe are upon you. From your re&s;olutions the prote&s;tant intere&s;t hopes for protection, as well as all our friends for the pre|&s;ervation of their independency; and our ene|mies fear the final di&s;appointment of their am|bitious and de&s;tructive views. Let the&s;e hopes and fears be confirmed and augmented by the vigour, unanimity, and di&s;patch of our pro|ceedings.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;In this expectation I am the more encou|raged by a plea&s;ing circum&s;tance, which I look upon as one of the mo&s;t au&s;picious omens of my reign. That happy extinction of divi&s;ions, and that union and good harmony which continue to prevail among&s;t my &s;ubjects, afford me the mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pect. The natural di&s;po&s;ition and wi&s;h of my heart, are to cement and promote them; and I promi&s;e my&s;elf that nothing will ari&s;e on your part to interrupt or di&s;turb a &s;itu|ation

&s;o e&s;&s;ential to the true and la&s;ting felicity of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> this great people.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The king, in pa&s;&s;ing from the palace of St. James's to St. Stephen's chapel, was &s;aluted by in|numerable crowds of people, who rent the air with acclamation, and &s;eemed to be tran&s;ported to a very unu&s;ual pitch of loyalty and affection; and tho&s;e who &s;aw what pa&s;&s;ed in the hou&s;e of peers were deeply affected with the &s;cene. Their ears had been long accu&s;tomed to foreign accents from the throne; a circum&s;tance at all times ungracious to an Engli&s;h ear: they could not therefore unmoved behold it filled with an amiable prince, born and educated among them, with an open ingenuous countenance, expre&s;&s;ing &s;entiment and benevo|lence; but when they heard him declare him&s;elf a Briton, in the warme&s;t terms of &s;elf-gratulation; when they heard him pronounce his oration in a clear melodious tone of voice, with all the graces of elocution, they could not help thinking them|&s;elves under the illu&s;ion of an agreeable dream: they were hurried back, in idea, to the favourite aeras of their admired Edwards and Henrys; and many were melted into tears of tenderne&s;s and joy. The&s;e raptures, how&s;oever general and intere&s;ting, did not hinder &s;ome individuals from regretting certain expre&s;&s;ions contained in this popular ha|rangue: they took exceptions to the declared in|tention of &s;upporting a continental war; and were &s;orry to hear the hackneyed pretence of the pro|te&s;tant intere&s;t repeated by a prince, who had &s;o little occa&s;ion to u&s;e any di&s;putable plea with a

<P>In the beginning of every new reign all the members of both hou&s;es being obliged by law to take the oaths again, this ceremony was performed in both hou&s;es, according to the u&s;ual form, as &s;oon as the king retired: then each prepared an addre&s;s, replete with the mo&s;t endearing expre&s;|&s;ions of loyalty and affection, and reverberating every paragraph as it proceeded from the throne. As the &s;ub&s;tance of both was &s;imilar, or rather the &s;ame, it will be &s;ufficient to repeat the addre&s;s of the commons, which ran in the following &s;train.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Petitions from con|fined deb|tors.</NOTE> As the acce&s;&s;ion of a new king to the throne of Great Britain has been generally di&s;tingui&s;hed by acts of grace in favour of debtors and delinquents, petitions were now pre&s;ented to the hou&s;e of com|mons by per&s;ons confined for debt in the different gaols of London, the borough of Southwark, and other parts of the kingdom, explaining their mi|&s;erable &s;ituation, and imploring relief from the le|gi&s;lature. An act in behalf of the&s;e objects had generally pa&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of every parlia|ment; but they were now encouraged to hope for immediate relief, not only from the elevation and character of the new &s;overeign, but al&s;o from the&s;e other con&s;iderations; that all the pri&s;ons in the kingdom were crouded; and many thou&s;ands of u&s;eful &s;ubjects lo&s;t to their country, at a time when the people were thinned by a cruel &s;anguinary war; and many branches of manufacture abandoned for want of labourers. The univer&s;al benevolence of the young monarch had even diffu&s;ed a dawn of hope to tho&s;e objects di&s;tingui&s;hed by the term of crown-pri&s;oners, of all other captives the mo&s;t wretched and forlorn; ina&s;much as they are in|dulged

All the&s;e fond il|lu&s;ions, however, vani&s;hed in di&s;appointment and de&s;pair. By pardoning atrocious crimes, a monarch certainly injures the community he was born to protect. But an act of grace, framed under pro|per exceptions and re&s;trictions, would undoubted|ly be an exertion of the royal prerogative, in which the genero&s;ity of the prince might happily coincide with the advantage of the people.</P>
<P>To the cries of the debtors the legi&s;lature lent a favourable ear, and a bill in their behalf was brought into the hou&s;e of commons. While they deliberated on this mea&s;ure, an humble remon|&s;trance was offered by the bankrupts confined within the pri&s;on of the King's Bench, repre&s;ent|ing the hard&s;hips to which they were expo&s;ed from a clau&s;e in the bill now depending, by which tho&s;e unfortunate bankrupts, who had not obtained their certificates, would be excluded from the benefit of the act; and expre&s;&s;ing their hope, that, as the legi&s;lature had hitherto judged other in&s;olvents to be proper objects of favour, they &s;hould be no longer debarred the benefit of that mercy which their fellow-&s;ufferers enjoyed.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bad con|&s;equences of the compell|ing clau&s;e.</NOTE> This compul&s;ive clau&s;e was attended with a con|&s;equence, which, in all probability, the legi&s;lature did not fore&s;ee. Great numbers of trade&s;men, and people in the lower cla&s;&s;es of life, and even many who had moved in a &s;uperior &s;phere, were &s;aid to have laid hold on this opportunity of di&s;|encumbering them&s;elves from their debts, which might have been hone&s;tly payed by a proper exer|tion of indu&s;try and temperance. Every per&s;on, de&s;irous of reaping the benefit of the act, prevailed upon &s;ome relation or friend to perform the part of compelling creditor. The public complained that the gaols about London were crouded with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e voluntary captives; and that a great number of hone&s;t men were ruined by this indulgence &s;hewn to their debtors by the clemency of parliament.

That it is an encourage|ment to idlene&s;s and profligacy, and a &s;trong temp|tation to fraud, in the minds of the vulgar, are truths which cannot be denied. At the &s;ame time we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that the greate&s;t national advan|tage may be attended with &s;ome inconvenience; that the advantage flowing from this clau&s;e is great and manife&s;t, as it emancipates many citizens from the wor&s;t kind of &s;lavery, prevents great numbers from abandoning their country, and reunites to the community many u&s;eful members, of who&s;e talents and indu&s;try it would otherwi&s;e be totally deprived.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other bills that received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</NOTE> A bill was formed, and pa&s;&s;ed into a law, for extending to hog's lard and grea&s;e the late act to di&s;continue, for a limited time, the duties payable upon tallow imported from Ireland. They took mea&s;ures for continuing the act "for the better &s;ecuring and encouraging the trade of his maje&s;ty's &s;ugar-colonies in America," which was near ex|piring. A bill was prepared, and pa&s;&s;ed, enabling the king to make lea&s;es and copies of offices, lands and hereditaments, parcel of his dutchy of Cornwal, or annexed to the &s;ame, and for other purpo&s;es therein mentioned. Another was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for preventing frauds committed by per|&s;ons navigating &s;mall boats, with provi&s;ions and re|fre&s;hments, upon the river Thames.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> numerous thefts and robberies that were commit|ted upon the river, to the great lo&s;s and detriment of merchants, owners of &s;hips, ve&s;&s;els, and other crafts belonging to the port of London, as well as to the inhabitants and occupiers of whar&s;s, yards, and tenements adjoining to the river. The &s;anc|tion of the legi&s;lature was al&s;o given to a bill for amending the law intituled, "An act to amend, and render more effectual, a former act for the fur|ther qualification of ju&s;tices of the peace," &s;o far as it obliged tho&s;e who had already taken and &s;ub|&s;cribed the qualification-oath, to take and &s;ub&s;cribe the &s;ame again at the general or quarter &s;e&s;&s;ion of the peace for the county, riding, or divi&s;ion, for which they intend to act in quality of ju&s;tices. Earl Mari&s;chal of Scotland, who had &s;o lately ob|tained his pardon, was now further indulged by the royal bounty: a &s;mall ballance on the purcha&s;e of one of his family e&s;tates, which had been for|feited in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixteen, remaining &s;till unpaid to the government by the tru&s;tees of the purcha&s;er, the earl pre&s;ented a petition to the hou&s;e of commons, expre&s;&s;ing his hope that his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty would, in compa&s;&s;ion to the &s;ufferings of the petitioner, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his family, be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to grant unto him, for his pre&s;ent &s;upport, what remained due to the crown of the purcha&s;e money, provided his maje&s;ty was enabled &s;o to do by the authority of parliament: he therefore prayed, that leave might be given to bring in a bill for this purpo&s;e. The king reinforced this petition with a gracious me&s;|&s;age, &s;ignified to the hou&s;e by the chancellor of the

In con&s;equence of this favour, the earl, in his old age, retrieved about &s;ix thou&s;and pounds of his original fortune, which was valued at above fifty thou&s;and pounds when he &s;uffered the attainder: but this wretched pittance being in&s;ufficient to maintain him in his own country, he found him&s;elf obliged to re&s;ide abroad; &s;o that he &s;eemed to reap very little comfort from the pardon which he had been &s;o &s;olicitous to obtain.</P>

This intimation was referred to the committee of &s;upply, and that re&s;olution taken in favour of the American provinces which we have mentioned above among the grants of the year. The royal me&s;&s;age was likewi&s;e procured in favour of the Ea&s;t India company, for enabling them to defray the expence of a military force in India; and they were accordingly gratified with the &s;um already &s;pecified under that article.

In a &s;peech from the throne he in|formed both hou&s;es of parliament, that, upon granting new commi&s;&s;ions to the judges, the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of their offices fell naturally under con|&s;ideration; that notwith&s;tanding the act pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of king William III. for &s;ettling the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the crown, by which act the commi&s;&s;ions of the judges were continued in force during their good behaviour; yet their offices had determined at the demi&s;e of the crown, or in &s;ix months after that event, as often as it had happened: that as he looked upon the independency and uprightne&s;s of the judges as e&s;&s;ential to the impartial admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice, one of the be&s;t &s;ecurities to the rights and liberties of his &s;ubjects, as well as con|ducive to the honour of the crown, he recom|mended this intere&s;ting object to the con&s;ideration of parliament, in order that &s;uch further provi&s;ion might be made for &s;ecuring the judges in the en|joyment of their offices during their good beha|viour, notwith&s;tanding any &s;uch demi&s;e, as &s;hould be mo&s;t expedient.

Nothing could &s;o much add to the plea&s;ure, which the&s;e con&s;i|derations afford me, as that I am now able to acquaint you with the great progre&s;s made of late by the com|bined army in Germany, un|der the command of prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick. I formerly told you, that the nature of the war, in tho&s;e parts, had kept the cam|paign there &s;till depending; and it now appears, to the &s;urprize of my enemies, that the &s;uperior ability and inde|fatigable activity of my ge|neral, and the &s;pirit and ar|dour of my officers and troops, have greatly profited of this per&s;everance, not|with&s;tanding all the difficul|ties ari&s;ing from the &s;ea&s;on.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> di&s;order, had procured a battalion of the York|&s;hire militia for their guard, and the&s;e were drawn up in the maket-place. The populace being re|inforced by a body of di&s;perate keelmen from Newca&s;tle, began to in&s;ult the guard with re|proaches, mi&s;&s;iles, and even with blows, which the militia for &s;ome time &s;u&s;tained with all the tem|perance of perfect di&s;cipline. The riot act was read, and the people were exhorted to retire to their re&s;pective habitations. But in&s;tead of com|plying with this advice, they became more intract|able. Encouraged by the forbearance of the mi|litia, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a notion that they would not commit ho&s;tilities, they proceeded from one act of outrage to another; a&s;&s;aulted them as they &s;tood arranged in order of battle, and with fire|arms killed an officer and a private &s;oldier. Thus exa&s;perated, the militia poured in upon them a regular di&s;charge, by which forty-five of the po|pulace were killed upon the &s;pot, and three hun|dred mi&s;erably wounded. The &s;urvivors imme|diately betook them&s;elves to flight, and many dropped down upon the road in their retreat.

As the la&s;t year was di&s;tingui&s;hed by an atrocious murder committed in London by a foreigner, &s;o the pre&s;ent exhibited an in&s;tance of another &s;tranger, who, in the &s;ame city, performed a deed of the &s;ame kind, though attended with much more &s;avage and horrible circum&s;tances. One Theodore Gardelle, a Swi&s;s painter, being warmed with &s;ome trivial provocation, layed vio|lent hands on Mrs. King, in who&s;e hou&s;e he lodged, near Leice&s;ter &s;quare, and deprived her of life in her own apartment. The rage of pa&s;&s;ion which prompted him to this exce&s;s was &s;ucceeded by a tran&s;port of terror, which hurried him into &s;uch mea&s;ures for his own pre&s;ervation as the humane reader will not under&s;tand without &s;huddering. He concealed what had pa&s;&s;ed by locking the apartment where the body lay, and by di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the maid &s;ervant, who happened to be ab&s;ent when the murder was committed. He had &s;ent her upon &s;ome errand to a different part of the town, as if the murder had been a premeditated &s;cheme: when &s;he returned, he told her Mrs. King was gone &s;uddenly to the country, and had directed him to di&s;mi&s;s her from her &s;ervice. He accordingly payed what wages were due to this woman, and &s;he retired. Being now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e, he pa&s;&s;ed the night alone in his own apartment. Next morning he de&s;cended to the chamber where the body of the unhappy woman lay, &s;eparated the
<PB N="220" REF="2240">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> head, and even di&s;&s;ected it with the mo&s;t gloomy deliberation. This he con&s;umed by fire: the bowels he took out, and buried in the &s;oil of the privy. He then di&s;membered the body, and de|&s;troyed the limbs with a fire made of green wood, that the &s;mell of fle&s;h might not alarm the neigh|bours. He divided the trunk in &s;mall pieces, and carrying part of them in a &s;ack, threw them into the river. This was a work of time, which he &s;eemed to brood over with a kind of horrid enjoy|ment. In the intervals of his labour, he &s;olaced him&s;elf with the conver&s;ation of a pro&s;titute, who lay with him in the hou&s;e, and from who&s;e &s;ide he ro&s;e early in the morning, in order to fini&s;h his dreadful ta&s;k. His guilt could not be long con|cealed. The &s;udden di&s;appearance of Mrs. King, and the di&s;tracted behaviour of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, created &s;u&s;picion. He found it nece&s;&s;ary to employ an occa&s;ional dome&s;tic, who perceived &s;igns of blood. The &s;ervant whom he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed exerted her&s;elf in his detection: a warrant was granted for appre|hending Gardelle; and &s;earch being made in the hou&s;e, parcells of the body were found. The mur|derer, being brought to trial, was convicted on the fulle&s;t evidence, and executed in the open &s;treet, not far from the place where the crime was com|mitted. He confe&s;&s;ed the murder; but denied that it was premeditated. He declared that Mrs. King had fir&s;t reproached, and then &s;truck him; that in pu&s;hing her from him, he was the occa&s;ion of her falling backwards; that her head pitching on the &s;ide of a bed, &s;he &s;eemed to have &s;u&s;tained a fracture of the &s;kull; that terrified by her cries,

The metropolitan &s;ee of Canterbury was worthily filled by Secker, renowned for his piety, candour, and urbanity. The office of lord high chancellor was con&s;erred upon lord Henley, baron Grange, who had eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf at the bar by his independent &s;pirit, know|ledge, and integrity. Lord Mansfield maintained his &s;eat on the King's Bench, and judge Willes in the Common Pleas.

Every place of polite re&s;ort became a temple of brutal confu&s;ion; and the conductors of the theatrical exhibitions thought their entertain|ments but indifferently received, if every repeated repre&s;entation did not produce a tumult, and &s;ome lives were not endangered by the thronging of the audience. This riotous di&s;po&s;ition was inflamed by tho&s;e &s;cenes of military parade and preparation, which were continually pa&s;&s;ing before the eyes of the people; the proce&s;&s;ions of recruiting parties, the evolutions of di&s;cipline, new levies of troops, marches and countermarches of entire battalions, and the warlike appearance of the national militia, which was by this time improved into a body of e&s;tabli&s;hed troops fit for &s;ervice. All the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances u&s;hered in a profu&s;ion of idle pagean|try, di&s;played in &s;cenes of barbarous pomp, pre|&s;cribed by the forms of the con&s;titution, for cele|brating the king's coronation. A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, appointing the twenty-&s;econd day of September for this ceremony; &s;o that the curio&s;ity of weak minds was fo&s;tered, during the whole &s;um|mer, to &s;uch a degree of impatience, that the whole attention of the people &s;eemed to center in this gaudy &s;pectacle; &s;uch preparations were made, and &s;uch eagerne&s;s was expre&s;&s;ed by per&s;ons of all degrees, that one would have imagined the whole nation on the brink of lunacy.</P>

On the &s;eventeenth day of the month, the prince&s;s, accompanied by the reigning duke her brother, &s;et out with all her at|tendants for Mirow, and proceeded to Perleberg, where the count de Gotter complimented her in the name of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch.

Seats and &s;caffolds were prepared along the &s;hore for &s;everal miles; and all the publicans re&s;iding near the banks of the river, both in Kent and E&s;|&s;ex, were enriched by an amazing conflux of com|pany. Every individual ob&s;erved the wind as ear|ne&s;tly as if his whole fortune depended on the fir&s;t change of weather; and London poured forth her &s;warms, like an immen&s;e hive, during the fir&s;t gleams of vernal &s;un&s;hine. All the medicinal wells to which wealthy people re&s;ort in the &s;um|mer, either for health or plea&s;ure, were now de|&s;erted; and numbers flocked to the metropolis from all parts of the united kingdom to &s;ee their &s;overeign's bride, and be eye&punc;witne&s;&s;es of the en|&s;uing coronation. After a tedious voyage of ten<NOTE PLACE="marg">Her arri|val and $uptials.</NOTE> days, during which the fleet was expo&s;ed to con|trary winds and tempe&s;tuous weather, the prince&s;s landed on the &s;eventh day of September in the af|ternoon at Harwich, where &s;he was received by the mayor and aldermen in their formalities.

Their applau&s;e was &s;ig|nified in tumultuous acclamations, which attended her for &s;everal miles; and the eagerne&s;s of the po|pulace was carried even to a degree of licentious zeal, which the guards could hardly re&s;train within the bounds of decent re&s;pect. Thus accompanied by great numbers of people in carriages, on hor&s;e|back, and a foot, this amiable prince&s;s proceeded through Hyde-park, down Con&s;titution-hill, to the garden-gate of the palace of St. James, where &s;he was handed out of her coach by the duke of Devon&s;hire, in quality of lord chamberlain. At the gate &s;he was received by the duke of York, and in the garden &s;he was met by the king him&s;elf, who&s;e looks declared the tran&s;ports of his joy. When &s;he made her obei&s;ance, he rai&s;ed her by the hand, which he ki&s;&s;ed, and then led her up-&s;tairs to the palace, where they dined together, with the whole royal family. At nine the nuptial ceremony was performed in the royal chapel, which had been magnificently decorated for the occa&s;ion. Be&s;ides the royal family, all the great officers of &s;tate, the nobility, peers and peere&s;&s;es, and the foreign mi|ni&s;ters, were pre&s;ent at the &s;ervice, the conclu&s;ion of which was announced to the people by the di&s;|charge of the artillery in the Park and at the Tower; and the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter were il|luminated in honour of this au&s;picious event.

We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall was prepared for the coronation&punc;banquet, by re|moving the courts of judicature, boarding the floor, erecting canopies, and building three rows of galleries for the accommodation of &s;pectators. A platform was laid between this Hall and the Abbey-church, where the king is actually crowned.

In the month of January captain Elphin&s;ton, commander of the Richmond, mounted with thirty-two guns, fell in with the Felicite, a French frigate, of the &s;ame force, off the coa&s;t of Holland; and a &s;e|vere engagement began about ten in the morn|ing, near Grave&s;ande, about eight miles from the Hague, to which place the prince of Orange, general Yorke the Briti&s;h envoy, and the count d'Affry the French amba&s;&s;ador, repaired with a great multitude of people, to behold the progre&s;s and i&s;&s;ue of the battle. About noon both &s;hips ran a&s;hore: neverthele&s;s the action was &s;till main|tained, until the enemy de&s;erted their quarters&punc; they afterwards abandoned the &s;hip, which was in|tirely de&s;troyed, after having lo&s;t their captain and about one hundred men, who &s;ell in the di&s;pute.

She was now mounted with thirty-five guns, and com|manded by Mr. le Verger de Belair, with a com|mi&s;&s;ion from the French king. Her crew amount|ed to about three hundred men, including a de|tachment of &s;oldiers; and he was bound to Pon|dicherry in the Ea&s;t Indies. Captain Hood, not|with&s;tanding her &s;uperior &s;ize, attacked her with|out he&s;itation, and was very warmly received. Several ma&s;ts in both &s;hips were &s;hot away, and they fell foul of one another, while the &s;ea ran very high; &s;o that the crews on both &s;ides were greatly encumbered by their broken ma&s;ts and &s;hattered rigging. At length the waves &s;eparated them, and the Warwick fell to leeward. Captain Hood, having cleared &s;hip, bore directly down upon the enemy: then the engagement was re|newed, and la&s;ted about an hour; at the expiration of which the captain of the Warwick &s;truck his colours, having lo&s;t about fourteen men killed outright, be&s;ides thirty-five wounded. The lo&s;s in number of men was equal on board the Miner|va, and all her ma&s;ts went by the board: never|thele&s;s the prize was brought in triumph to Spit|head.

The action was main|tained on both &s;ides with uncommon fury, until the Vengeance being &s;et on fire by the enemy's wadding, the French re&s;olved to take advantage of the confu&s;ion produced by this accident, and, running their bow&s;prit upon the taffaril of the Engli&s;h frigate, attempted to board her.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark|able en|gagement by the captains Faulkner and Lo|gie.</NOTE> One of the mo&s;t remarkable and &s;hining actions that di&s;tingui&s;hed this war, and proved beyond all contradiction the &s;uperiority which the Engli&s;h claimed over the French in point of naval di&s;ci|pline, was an incident which we &s;hall now relate. On Monday the tenth of Augu&s;t, captain Faulk|ner of the Bellona, a &s;hip of the line, and captain Logie of the Brilliant, a frigate of thirty guns, $ailed from the river Tagus for England, having on board a con&s;iderable &s;um of money for the mer|chants of London. On Thur&s;day in the afternoon, being then off Vigo, they di&s;covered three fail of &s;hips &s;tanding in for the land, one of the line of battle, and two frigates. They no &s;ooner de&s;cried captain Faulkner, than they bore down upon him, until within the di&s;tance of &s;even miles, when, &s;ee|ing the Bellona and the frigate through the mag|nifying medium of a hazy atmo&s;phere, they mi&s;|took them both for two-decked &s;hips, and dread|ing the i&s;&s;ue of an engagement, re&s;olved to avoid the encounter.

Captain Faulkner being by this time convinced of their &s;ize, and conjecturing, from the intelligence he had received, that the large &s;hip was the Cou|rageux (in which particular he was not mi&s;taken), he hoi&s;ted all the canvas he could carry, and gave chace until &s;un-&s;et, when one of the French fri|gates hauling out in the offing, he di&s;played a

They kept &s;ight of the enemy during the whole night and at &s;un-ri&s;e had gained but about two mile upon them in a chace of fourteen hours; &s;o tha$ the French commodore might have &s;till avoided a$ engagement for the whole day, and enjoyed the chance of e&s;caping in the darkne&s;s of the &s;ucceed+ing night; but he no longer declined the action The air being perfectly &s;erene, he now perceived that one of the Engli&s;h &s;hips was a frigate; and the Bellona her&s;elf, which was one of the be&s;t con|&s;tituted &s;hips in the Engli&s;h navy, lay &s;o flu&s;h in the water as to appear at a di&s;tance con&s;iderably &s;maller than &s;he really was. The French com|mander, therefore, being a man of &s;pirit, hoi&s;ted a red en&s;ign on the mizzen &s;hrouds, as a &s;ignal for his two frigates to clo&s;e with and engage the Bril|liant. At the &s;ame time he hauled down his &s;tud+ding &s;ails, wore round, and &s;tood for the Bellona under his top&s;ails; while captain Faulkner ad|vanced towards her with an ea&s;y &s;ail, and ordere$ his quarters to be manned.

Th$ two &s;hips were equal in burthen, in number o$ guns, and in weight of metal. The crew on boar$ of the Courageux amounted to &s;even hundred men able to &s;tand to their quarters; and they were com+manded by M. du Guy Lambert, an officer of ap+proved valour and ability. The Bellona's comple+$ent con&s;i&s;ted of five hundred and fifty cho&s;e

The fire on both &s;ides was &s;u&s;pended until they were within mu&s;ket &s;hot of each other, and then the engagement began with a dreadful di&s;charge of fire-arms and artillery. In le&s;s than nine mi|nutes all the Bellona's braces, bowlings, &s;hrowds, and rigging, were cut and &s;hatt$red by the &s;hot, and the m zen ma&s;t fell over the &s;tern, with all the men on the round top, who, neverthele&s;s, &s;aved their lives, by clambering into the port|holes of the gun-room. Captain Faulkener, ap|prehen&s;ive that the enemy would &s;eize the oppor|tunity of his being di&s;abled, and endeavour to e&s;cape, gave orders for immediate boarding; an attempt which the po&s;ition of the two &s;hips &s;oon rendered altogether impracticable. The Coura|geux was now falling athwart the f$re foot, or bows of the Bellona, in which ca&s;e the Engli&s;h &s;hip mu&s;t have been raked fore and a$t with great execution.

Every &s;hot took place, and bore de&s;truction along with it. The &s;ides of the Courageux were &s;hatter|ed and torn by every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive broad&s;ide, and her decks were &s;trewed with carnage. About twenty minutes did the enemy &s;u&s;tain the havock made by this battery, &s;o ince&s;&s;antly plied, and &s;o fatally di|rected. At length it became &s;o intolerable, that the French en&s;ign was hauled down: the rage of battle cea&s;ed; the Engli&s;h mariners had left their quarters, and the officers congratulated each other on the &s;ucce&s;s of the day. At this juncture a &s;hot being unexpectedly fired from the lower tier of the Courageux, the Briti&s;h &s;eamen ran to their quarters, and, without orders, poured in two broad&s;ides upon the enemy, who now called for quarter, and an end was put to the engagement. The damage done to the rigging of the Bellona was con&s;iderable, but &s;he &s;uffered very little in the hull, and the number of the killed and wounded did not exceed forty. The ca&s;e was very different with the Courageux, which now ap|peared like a wreck upon the water. Nothing was &s;een &s;tanding but her forema&s;t and bow&punc;&s;prit; large breaches were made in her &s;ides; her decks were torn up in &s;everal parts; many of her guns were di&s;mounted; and her quarters were filled with the mangled bodies of the dying and the dead. Above two hundred and twenty were kil|led outright, and half that number was brought a&s;hore wounded to Li&s;bon, to which place the

Captain Faulkener was not<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> more commendable for his gallantry in the action, than for the humanity and politene&s;s with which he treated his pri&s;oners, who&s;e grateful acknow|ledgement, and un&s;olicited applau&s;e, con&s;titute the faire&s;t te&s;timony that a man of honour can en|joy. Nor ought we to with hold our prai&s;e from Capt. Logie of the Brilliant, who&s;e valour and dexterity, in a great mea&s;ure, contributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of his commodore. Perceiving it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to acquire any thing but laurels from two frigates, the lea&s;t of which was of equal &s;trength with the &s;hip he commanded; he re&s;olved to amu&s;e them both, &s;o as to hinder either from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Courageux.

With re&s;pect to the interruption of the French navigation, the &s;ame purpo&s;e is more effectually an&s;wered by maintaining a &s;quadron in the bay of Quiberon, without which the i&s;land can be of no u&s;e, as it affords not one harbour in which a &s;hip of war could lie at anchor. But the &s;tronge&s;t argument again&s;t this expedition, was derived from the nature of the i&s;land, fenced around by inacce&s;&s;ible rocks, except at a few open|ings, which the enemy had rai&s;ed &s;trong bulwarks to defend. In the cour&s;e of the la&s;t &s;ummer they had been apprized of the de&s;tination of the Bri|ti&s;h armament, and taken great pains to entrench and fortify every place where they thought it was po&s;&s;ible to make a de&s;cent. The citadel of Pa|lais, planned and executed by the celebrated en|gineer Vauban, was counted one of the &s;tronge&s;t fortifications belonging to France; and the garri|&s;on, amounting to above three thou&s;and choice men was commanded by the Chevalier de St. Croix, one of the mo&s;t re&s;olute and active officers of that kingdom. Why this &s;cheme was preferred to other objects of &s;eemingly greater importance, we &s;hall not pretend to explain: &s;ar le&s;s can we account for its being delayed a whole year at &s;uch an expence to the nation; as if ho&s;tilities had

All that he could do, in the mean time, was to publi&s;h a manife&s;to, addre&s;&s;ed to the inhabitants, declaring, that, if they would put them&s;elves un|der the protection of the Briti&s;h government, they &s;hould be indulged with the free exerci&s;e of their religion, and retain all the rights and privileges which they had ever enjoyed. This a&s;&s;urance pro|duced a con&s;iderable effect among the natives, a good number of whom immediately clo&s;ed with the propo&s;al. The next &s;tep the general took was to &s;ummon the French commandant, who re|mained encamped under the walls of the citadel, and declared he would defend the place to the la&s;t extremity; and indeed it mu&s;t be owned, for the honour of this gentleman, that, in the cour&s;e of the &s;iege, he performed every thing that could be expected from a gallant officer, con&s;ummate in the art of war. About the latter end of April, &s;ome mortars being brought up, began to play upon the town, within the walls of which the enemy now retired; and at this juncture Sir William Peere Williams, a captain in Burgoyne's light hor&s;e, was &s;hot by a French centinel, in recon|noitring their &s;ituation.

On the other hand, the enemy attacked the po&s;t of Gentzungen near Filtzberg, from whence they were repulled with &s;ome damage.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;&s;el be|&s;ieged by the al$$$s.</NOTE> The all$ed army was cantoned in two lines, with the right extending to the Lahne, and the left &s;tretched towards Fulda; while prince Ferdinand e&s;tabli&s;hed his quarters at Schwien&s;berg.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Ferdi|nand re|treats.</NOTE> After this di&s;a&s;ter, the allies continued to retreat as the enemy advanced. They abandoned the &s;iege of Ziegenhayn, from which they did not re|tire without con&s;iderable lo&s;s. All the places they had lately reduced were now de&s;erted. The &s;iege of Ca&s;&s;el was rai&s;ed; the army retired behind the Dymel, and prince Ferdinand e&s;tabli&s;hed his head|quarters at Neuhas near Paderborn. In con&s;e|quence of the&s;e motions, the French were again in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole landgraviate of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, ma&s;ters of Gottingen and Munden in Hanover, and at liberty to penetrate into the heart of that electorate. The &s;ituation of the allies &s;eemed the more critical, as the prince de Soubi&s;e was at the head of a &s;econd French army, cantoned on the Lower Rhine; and if he had heartily co-operated with the marechal de Broglio, there is no doubt but they might have terminated the war before the clo&s;e of &s;ummer.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s of de|tached parties.</NOTE> The progre&s;s of the French was retarded by the lo&s;s of a large magazine of hay, collected at We&s;el on the Rhine, which was con&s;umed by fire, not without &s;u&s;picion that it was wilfully de&s;troyed. The hereditary prince of Brun&s;wick, at the head of a &s;eparate body, advanced to Nettelen, in the neigh|bourhood of Mun&s;ter, about the middle of May, to ob&s;erve the motions of the army under Soubi&s;e, who ordered three different camps to be formed at Du&s;&s;eldorff, Burich, and Rees, though part of his forces &s;till remained in cantonment. The war was in the mean time carried on by detached parties, and &s;kirmi&s;hes were fought with various &s;ucce&s;s. The army of the duke de Broglio, having pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel about the latter end of June, drove general Sporcken from his po&s;t on the left of that river, with the lo&s;s of eight hundred men taken pri&s;oners, nineteen pieces of cannon, four hundred hor&s;es, and two hundred waggons. After this ex|ploit, the French made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of War|burg, Paderborn, and Dringelbroen, and obliged prince Ferdinand to repa&s;s the Lippe on the &s;econd day of July. The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, however, were over|ballanced by the atchievements of detached par|ties, which he &s;ent forth from time to time to har|ra&s;s them in their motions, and intercept their con|veys of provi&s;ion. On the thirteenth day of July, in the morning, general Luckner with his detach|ment advanced to Salme, where the count de Cha|bot

Other par|ties de&s;troyed the French convoys in the neigh|bourhood of Ca&s;&s;el, and did &s;uch con&s;iderable da|mage to the enemy, that they re&s;olved to join the armies, and give battle to prince Ferdinand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Kirch-Den$|ke$n.</NOTE> The allies were encamped at Hohenover: the right wing, at the extremity of which the heredi|tary prince was po&s;ted, extended as far as the v$l|lage of Buder$h, and this was guarded by a de|tachment. The body of the army occupied the heights of Wambeln; and the prince of Anhal$ po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the ground between Illingen and Hohe|nover. The marquis of Granby maintained his po&s;ition on the heights of Kirch-Denckern: lieu|tenant-general Wutgenau, moving from the heath of Untrup, marched by his right, in order to ap|proach the village of Kirch Denckern: the avenue$ and po&s;ts on the little rivers Aa&s;t and Sultzbah were guarded by the piquets of the army. On the fifteenth day of July, in the evening, the army of Soubi&s;e, having &s;truck their tents, advanced on the left of the allies, and di&s;lodged the advanced po&s;ts of lord Granby, again&s;t who&s;e corps their chief effort was directed. Prince Ferdinand now thought proper to make a new di&s;po&s;ition. The marquis was directed to maintain his ground to the la&s;t ex|tremity. Wutgenau was ordered to make a mo|tion to the left, to block up the high road from Lip&s;tadt to Ham, and to act in concert with the

Lieutenant-general Conway replaced the prince of Anhalt, be|tween Illingen and Hohenover. The hereditary prince ordered lieutenant-general Bo&s;e to occupy the heights of Wambeln, leaving count Kilman|&s;egge on the &s;ide of Buderich. The greate&s;t part of the artillery was di&s;tributed by count Shaum|bourg Lippe on the front of the left. General Sporcken, who encamped with a &s;eparate body at Hortzfeld, was ordered to detach &s;ix &s;quadrons, and as many battal$ons, over the Lippe, to &s;up|port M. de Wutgenau, and to act with the re&s;t as he &s;hould judge mo&s;t effectual for the advantage of the whole. Lord Granby, being furiou&s;ly attacked by the enemy, &s;u&s;tained a prodigious fire of artil|lery and &s;mall arms, and with un&s;haken re&s;olution with&s;tood all their efforts until the arrival of Wutgenau; who, advancing on his left, and charg|ing them in flank, obliged them to retire into the woods with precipitation: then he extended his right to Haus-Vilinghau&s;en, and turned his left towards the high road of Ham, the defence of which place was his chief object. Prince Ferdi|nand having learned from the pri&s;oners that mare|chal Broglio had decamped from Erwite at break of day, in order to join Soubi&s;e, and give battle to the allies, concluded that the &s;tronge&s;t efforts would be made upon his l$ft, and took his precau|tions accordingly. He ordered general Howard to bring up the brigade of infantry commanded by

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> lord Frederick Cavendi&s;h, and the cavalry of lord Pembroke. Colonel Grevendor&s;f was detached with two battalions to barricade and fortify the village of Kirch&punc;Denckern, and to be there &s;up|ported, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, by General Howard. Mean while, the enemy kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome po&s;ts oppo&s;ite to the picquets of the allied ar|my, and the patroles &s;kirmi&s;hed all night. At three in the morning the whole French army ad|vanced again to the attack on the &s;ide where Wut|genau was po&s;ted, and a dreadful fire of cannon and mu&s;quetry was maintained on both &s;ides for five hours, during which the enemy was not able to gain one inch of ground. About nine, prince Ferdinand receiving intimation that the$r de&s;ign was to cannonade the camp of lord Granby from an oppo&s;ite eminence, immediately ordered a body of troops to anticipate this operation by a vigorous charge. This movement proved deci&s;ive. The troops advanced with amazing intrepidity, and at|tacked with &s;uch vigour as in a little time obliged the enemy to give way, and abandon the field in confu&s;ion. Their left, which &s;till maintained a &s;e|vere cannonade on that &s;ide where the hereditary prince commanded, no &s;ooner under&s;tood the mi&s;|carriage on their right than they de&s;i&s;ted from the attack, and retreated in order. The le$t of the enemy was pur&s;ued as far as Hiltrup, about a league from the $ield of battle; but as the nature of the ground did not permit the cavalry to act, they &s;$$tained the le&s;s damage in their retreat. In this un&s;ucce&s;sful attack they lo&s;t about four thou|$$nd men, killed or taken, with a few colours, an$

In other re&s;pects, the victory would have been attended with little advantage, had the enemy continued to act in concert, and avail them&s;elves of their great &s;u|periority in point of number. But their generals were &s;aid to be actuated by motives of per&s;onal pique, and to have mutually thwarted the &s;chemes of each other. Broglio, proud, warm, and enter|pri&s;ing, valued him&s;elf upon his military talents, and owed his command to the prevailing opinion that he was the be&s;t general in France. The prince de Soubi&s;e was deemed a better citizen than a &s;oldier: generous, humane, and amiable in his private cha|racter, he a&s;pired not to military glory; but &s;uf|fered him&s;elf to be u&s;ed as an in&s;trument to gra|tify the re&s;entment of the marchione&s;s de Pompa|dour, who hated the marechal duke de Broglio.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Soubi&s;e retreats to the Roer.</NOTE> Certain it is, after the action of Kirch Denckern, which the French denominate from the village of Fillinghau&s;en, their two armies were di&s;united.

But his pa&s;&s;age of the Roer was de&s;igned to &s;ecure a great number of barges coming down the Rhine, loaden with forage for his army; and, before he took this &s;tep, he &s;ent off two large detachments to reinforce Brog|lio. Having received his forage, he repa&s;&s;ed both the Roer and the Lippe, and advanced as far as Dulmen; while Broglio, penetrating further into the electorate of Hanover, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of

The French general encamped in his neighbourhood, on the heights of Neim, and many &s;kirmi&s;hes en|&s;ued; in one of which prince Henry, brother to the hereditary prince of Brun&s;wick, was mortally wounded. About the middle of Augu&s;t an advan|tage was gained at Ca&s;&s;el by general Luckner, who attacked and routed a body of the enemy, from whom he took a con&s;iderable number of men and hor&s;es.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">W$l&s;em|b$$$le taken by the French.</NOTE> Marechal Broglio having pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er with his whole army, as if his intention had been to at|tack the city of Hanover, pince Ferdinand made a forced march, pa&s;&s;ed the Dymel, and approached Ca&s;&s;el. This movement obliged the French ge|neral to return with the greater part of his army: then prince Ferdinand, retreating to Paderborn, e&s;tabli&s;hed his head-quarters at Buhne, from whence he extended his forces towards Hamelen. Broglio once more pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, encamped near Eim|beck, and laid the whole country under contri|bution. In the mean time, Soubi&s;e having e&s;ta|bli&s;hed his ovens at Dor&s;ten, and garri&s;oned the place with one battalion, the hereditary prince found means to attack and reduce the town, to make pri&s;oners of the garri&s;on, to demoli&s;h the ovens, and de&s;troy the magazines there provided: an exploit, in con&s;equence of which the prince de Soubi&s;e retreated to the other &s;ide of the Lippe; but he &s;oon repa&s;&s;ed that river, and advanced again

While prince Ferdinand lay encamped at Will|hem&s;thall in the neighbourhood of Hamelen, and the hereditary prince at the head of a detachment &s;coured the open country of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, the ma|rechal Broglio made repri&s;als in the Hartz, where he reduced and demoli&s;hed the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Schutzfels, and made the garri&s;on pri&s;oners of war. A detachment, commanded by his brother the count de Broglio, and prince Xavier of Saxony, having made a forced march, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Wolfembuttle, and then inve&s;ted Brun&s;wick; but before they could reduce this city, the hereditary prince being joined by general Luckner, flew to the relief of his own capital.

M. de Chabot no &s;ooner under&s;tood that he had pa&s;&s;ed the river, than he began early in the morning of the fifth to retreat towards Eimbeck; but, when he approach|ed Wicken&s;en, he found the road po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a &s;trong body of Briti&s;h grenadiers and Highlanders: for the marquis of Granby had gallantly forced the enemy's po&s;t at Cappelnhagen, and blocked up the defile by the hour appointed. Chabot, per|ceiving him&s;elf intercepted, retreated immediate|ly towards E&s;cher&s;hau&s;en, and &s;truck into the other road to Eimbeck, which general Hardenberg had been ordered to occupy: but in his march to Baden|werder &s;ome of his pontoons were overturned, and this accident retarded him &s;o long, that he did not reach the place appointed until &s;even in the morn|ing; and by that time Chabot had pa&s;&s;ed the de|file in his way to Eimbeck, where he arrived at noon, without further interruption. Thus the plan mi&s;carried; and this will generally be the fate

This was the la&s;t tran&s;action of any con&s;e|quence that happened between the contend ng ar|mies in We&s;tphalia. Broglio quartered his army in Ca&s;&s;el, and that neighbourhood.

The king of P&mdash;had derived caution and circum&s;pection from a re|petition of mi&s;carriages and di&s;appointments. He knew too well the vigilance, activity, and fortitude of the Au&s;trian general Laudohn, to hope he &s;hould acquire any material advantage from a &s;udden im|petuo&s;ity of attack. The number of his forces was con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by the di&s;ea&s;es of the camp, as well as by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of indeci&s;ive bat|tles. His dominions were already half depopu|lated by the draughts he had made to recruit his armies; whereas the countries po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his ene|mies were much more capable to &s;upply &s;uch con|tinual drains. The &s;take which he hazarded was therefore the more important; and he plainly per|ceived, that even a repetition of victory would complete his ruin. Be&s;ides, Laudohn had taken his mea&s;ures &s;o artfully, that he could not be at|tacked with any pro&s;pect of advantage; and the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch could not &s;hift the &s;cene into another country, without abandoning his maga|zines and cities of refuge in Sile&s;ia. Such indeed was his &s;ituation, that he could not move, without expo&s;ing him&s;elf to lo&s;s or di&s;comfiture. He there|fore determined to maintain his ground, and act upon the defen&s;ive; and in&s;tructions to the &s;ame purpo&s;e were communicated to his brother prince Henry, who&s;e army was cantoned in Saxony, in the neighbourhood of that commanded by count Daun the Au&s;trian general.</P>

The Ru&s;&s;ian mini&s;try, hav|ing been long &s;en&s;ible of the inconveniencies to which their operations were &s;ubject from their great di&s;tance from the &s;cene of action, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;i|ble, to reduce Colberg, which would &s;erve as a magazine and a key to Pomerania. For this pur|po&s;e, general Romanzoff was detached, in the month of July, with a con&s;iderable body of forces to inve&s;t that fortre&s;s by land, while it &s;hould be blocked up by &s;ea by a &s;trong &s;quadron, in which an additional number of troops with the ar|tillery and warlike &s;tores were tran&s;ported. This was joined by the Swedi&s;h fleet in Augu&s;t, and Ro|manzoff began to canonnade the place; but, as he

The Swedes, at the &s;ame time, &s;eemed to favour the operations of their allies. Their army in we&s;tern Pomerania, having received a reinforcement, began to advance again to the Pru&s;&s;ian territories, and &s;kirmi&s;hed with Stutterheim; but no action of con&s;equence was hazarded on either &s;ide.</P>

In May, however, a detachment ad|vanced towards Sile&s;ia without artillery, and formed a camp at Bojanovo: another body e&s;tabli&s;hed a con&s;iderable magazine at Po&s;en; a third, under count Tottleben, penetrated into Pomerania in the beginning of June, and made a furious attack upon Belgarde, from whence he was repul&s;ed with con&s;i|derable lo&s;s.

Immediately after this at|chievement, general Butturlin &s;eparated the main body of his army from the Au&s;trians, and retreated towards Poland; yet he left general Czernicheff with a con&s;iderable body of forces to co-operate with Laudohn, who, about this juncture, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf by an extraordinary exploit&punc; which proved very detrimental to the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch's affairs.</P>

It was central in its &s;ituation, &s;trongly for|tified, and contained a great magazine of military &s;tores and artillery. Laudohn formed a &s;cheme for reducing it by &s;urprize, and it &s;ucceeded be|yond expectation. On the fir&s;t day of October, at three in the morning, the troops &s;elected for this &s;ervice advanced to the attack in four different places, and, under the favour of a thick fog, not only approached, but even fixed their &s;caling lad|ders, before they were perceived by the garri&s;on, who &s;carce had time to fire a few cannon at the a&s;&s;ailants. The conte&s;t, however, was maintained for &s;ome time with &s;mall arms, until a powder-ma|gazine in one of the outworks blew up, and about &s;ix hundred men on both &s;ides were de&s;troyed by the explo&s;ion. The Au&s;trians, taking advantage of the confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned by this accident, ad|vanced to the body of the place, and bur&s;ting open the gates, entered the town without much oppo&s;i|tion. At day-break they found them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the place; and the governor, lieutenant-general Za&s;trow, with all his garri&s;on, amounting to three thou&s;and men, were made pri&s;oners. Thus Lau|dohn, at the expence of about &s;ix hundred men, who fell in the attack, took above five times that number; and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of a &s;trong im|portant fortre&s;s, in which he found a va&s;t magazine of meal, and a numerous train of artillery.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;pira|cy again&s;t the per|&s;on of the Pru&s;|&s;ian mo|narch.</NOTE> In the beginning of December he there can|toned his army, and the Au&s;trian forces were quar|tered in the neighbourhood of Scheweidnitz. Im|mediately before the king repaired to Bre&s;lau, he had the good fortune to detect a con&s;piracy, which was formed again&s;t his per&s;on by the baron de Warkotch, a man of con&s;iderable rank and for|tune in Sile&s;ia, and one Francis Schmedt, a prie&s;t. Their intention was to &s;eize the king when he &s;hould come forth unattended, and convey him to the Au&s;trian camp: but whether they were coun|tenanced in this &s;cheme by the court of Vienna, is a que&s;tion which hath not yet been determined. The di&s;covery was made by one of the baron's do|me&s;tics, who&punc; being charged with a letter from the baron to the eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and &s;u&s;pecting the contents, delivered it to the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch. Thus the my&s;tery was unravelled: a detachment was immediately &s;ent to apprehend the baron, and &s;eize all his papers. Both were accordingly &s;ecured; but he afterwards found means to e&s;cape through a window. His lady was, however, detained in cu&s;|tody. Schmedt having likewi&s;e con&s;ulted his &s;afe|ty by flight, the king cau&s;ed them to be cited to appear by the twenty-fir&s;t day of January, to an|&s;wer to the charge brought again&s;t them, on pain of forfeiting their lives and e&s;tates.

The captivity of an incendiary prince will generally &s;top the effu&s;ion of blood, and put an end to the horror and de&s;olation of war; but the de&s;truction of towns and magazines in|volves the innocent in calamity, and extends the mi&s;eries of the human &s;pecies: for the magazines, thus de&s;troyed, are commonly repaired at the ex|pence of the unhappy country into which the &s;eat of war has been transferred.</P>

The blockade had for &s;ome time been converted to a regular &s;iege; and colonel Haden, who commanded the garri&s;on, made a very ob&s;tinate defence. In the beginning of October, the boi&s;|terous weather obliged the Swedi&s;h &s;quadron to re|tire. A Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hip of the line was wrecked, and all the crew peri&s;hed: their ho&s;pital &s;hip was acci|dentally &s;et on fire and de&s;troyed: in a word, the Ru&s;&s;ian fleet likewi&s;e withdrew, and returned to Cron&s;tadt; and then the garri&s;on of Colberg received a large &s;upply of provi&s;ion from Stetin. The&s;e circum&s;tances concurring with the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on, it was imagined, would compel even the Ru&s;&s;ians to quit the field, and at any rate render the operations of the &s;iege impracticable; but Ro|manzoff &s;eemed to &s;et the winter at defiance, and pro&s;ecuted his works with unabating vigour, until he reduced a &s;mall fort that commanded the har|bour.

<P>We &s;hall conclude the foreign tran&s;actions of this year, with an incident that demon&s;trates the cautious regard with which the powers of Europe avoid every opportunity of giving umbrage to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Incident relating to Malta.</NOTE> Ottoman Porte. In the cour&s;e of the preceding year, a large Turki&s;h &s;hip of the line, called the Ottoman Crowne, was &s;eized by the Chri&s;tian-&s;laves on board, who ro&s;e upon the Turks, and, having defeated them, brought the &s;hip into Malta; where, according to cu&s;tom, the prize was divided among the captors. The Porte de|manded the re&s;titution of the &s;hip in the mo&s;t in&s;o|lent terms; and the knights of Malta, who are a$ perpetual war with the infidels, treated this de|mand with di&s;dain. The grand &s;ignior, incen&s;ed at the refu&s;al, &s;ent a public man$fe$to Naples by

the capuchins of Tunis, in which he bitterly com|plained<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> of the Malte&s;e knights, and threatened their total extirpation; at the &s;ame time he began to equip a formidable fleet of &s;hips and galleys: but as he cau&s;ed large quantities of warlike &s;tores to be conveyed by the Black Sea to the mouth of the Danube, and the report prevailed that he had lately concluded a treaty of alliance with the Pru&s;|&s;ian monarch, certain powers &s;u&s;pected that he harboured &s;ome other de&s;ign, under the pretext of an armament again&s;t Malta. The empre&s;s queen of Hungary, to avoid all occa&s;ion of giving um|brage to the Porte, forbade all the knights of Malta re&s;iding in her dominions, to repair to the de|fence of that i&s;land, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be attacked: a circum&s;tance that plainly evinces what regard even the mo&s;t bigotted powers pay to the in&s;titu|tions of religion, when they interfere with tempo|ral intere&s;ts. The French king acted on this oc|ca&s;ion, with more delicacy and di&s;cretion. He purcha&s;ed the Turki&s;h &s;hip which had been taken, and &s;ent it to Con&s;tantinople as a pre&s;ent to the &s;ultan. It was protected in the voyage by the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers; and the grand &s;ignior was plea&s;ed to &s;ignify that his re&s;entment was appea&s;ed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of a ne|gociation for peace between the courts of Lon|don and Ver&s;ailles</NOTE> The mo&s;t important tran&s;action that di&s;tingui&s;hed this year, was a negociation for peace between Great Britain and France, which was brought upon the carpet at the reque&s;t of the court of Ver&s;ailles. We have already ob&s;erved, that the powers at war had agreed to open a general congre&s;s at Aug&s;|burg; and the Briti&s;h plenipotentiaries were ac|tually nominated at the court of London; when
<PB N="292" REF="3000">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> the French king made advances towards a &s;eparate pacification with England, under the mediation of the Spani&s;h monarch. The count d'Affry, amba&s;|&s;ador from France at the Hague, had &s;everal con|ferences on this &s;ubject with general York, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter; but the&s;e proving abortive, and the i&s;&s;ue of the congre&s;s being di&s;tant and uncer|tain, the court of Ver&s;ailles took an extraordinary &s;tep to effectuate an immediate peace with England. A memorial of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty was, in the month of March, tran&s;mitted by the hands of prince Gallitzin, the Ru&s;&s;ian amba&s;&s;ador at London, to Mr. &s;ecretary Pitt, with a letter from the Due de Choi&s;eul the French mini&s;ter, &s;igni|fying that the king of France hoped the frank and ingenuous manner in which he propo&s;ed to treat with his Britannic maje&s;ty, would bani&s;h all &s;u&s;|picion and mi&s;tru&s;t from the negociation, and en|gage the king of England to di&s;clo&s;e his real &s;enti|ments, either with regard to the continuation of the war, or the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace. He likewi&s;e declared, that, with re&s;pect to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, his ma&s;ter's allies were determined to act at the future congre&s;s, according to the dictates of ju&s;tice and good faith, &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to promote the inte|re&s;ts of humanity, and re&s;tore the peace of Europe. The French king, in his memorial, expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire that the particular accommodation between France and England &s;hould be united with the general pacification of Europe; but, as the objects of the war between France and England were totally foreign to the di&s;putes in Germany, he thought it would be nece&s;&s;ary to agree with his
<PB N="293" REF="3010">
Britannic maje&s;ty upon certain principal points which<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> &s;hould form the ba&s;is of their particular negociation. In order to avoid the delays which a minute and te|dious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of particular circum&s;tances might occa&s;ion, he propo&s;ed that the two crowns &s;hould remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they &s;hould have con|quered from each other in different parts of the world, at the following periods of time; in the Ea&s;t-Indies, on the fir&s;t day of September in the pre&s;ent year; in the We&s;t-Indies and Africa, on the fir&s;t of July; and in Europe, on the fir&s;t of May: but, as the&s;e terms might be thought either too near or too remote; and the king of England might be of opinion that compen&s;ations &s;hould be made in whole, or in part, for the reciprocal con|que&s;ts of the two crowns; he would willingly com|mence a negociation on the&s;e &s;ubjects; his chief aim being to evince his hearty de&s;ire of removing all ob&s;tacles which might ob&s;truct the &s;alutary object of peace. The&s;e advances met with a favourable reception at the court of London. Mr. &s;ecretary Pitt wrote an immediate an&s;wer to the Duc de Choi&s;eul, expre&s;&s;ing his ma&s;ter's &s;incere de&s;ire to corre&s;pond with the pacific &s;entiments of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty. At the &s;ame time he declared, that the king of England was determined to &s;up|port the intere&s;t of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch and his other allies, with the cordiality and efficacy of a &s;incere and faithful ally. This letter was accom|panied with a memorial, in which his Britannic maje&s;ty acknowledged that the objects which oc|ca&s;ioned the war between England and France, were totally foreign from the di&s;putes in Germany.
<PB N="294" REF="3020">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> He agreed that the two crowns &s;hould remain in&punc; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the conque&s;ts they had made upon each other; but he objected to the dates pre&s;cribed, without propo&s;ing any other. Neverthele&s;s, he declared he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee in London, a per|&s;on duly authorized by his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, to enter with the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters into a final di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e points, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the intere&s;ts of the two nations. Accordingly, in the cour&s;e of the corre&s;pondence between the two &s;ecretaries, it was agreed that the &s;ieur de Bu&s;&s;y, who had formerly re&s;ided in a public character at London, &s;hould be appointed mini&s;ter, and repair to that court in or|der to manage the negociation; while Mr. Stanley &s;hould act at Ver&s;ailles in the &s;ame capacity. In the mean time &s;everal letters and memorials were inter|changed between the two courts. It was in the month of May that Mr. Stanley cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea from Dover to Calais, and at the &s;ame time M de Bu&s;&s;y arrived at London.

In the conferences which en&s;ued at London and Ver&s;ailles, the French mini&s;ters continued to pre&s;s a &s;pecification of the aeras at which the two nations &s;hould be entitled to the <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis;</HI> and the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this point the Engli&s;h negociators avoided, until the citadel of Bellei&s;le was reduced. Then the Engli&s;h mini&s;try declared by a memorial, in explicit terms, that the fir&s;t of July, September, and November next en|&s;uing, &s;hould be the e&s;tabli&s;hed aeras, after which all the conque&s;ts that might be made on either &s;ide, &s;hould be mutually re&s;tored: but, to the&s;e aeras, the king of England agreed only on the following conditions: That every thing &s;ettled between the two crowns, in relation to their particular di&s;putes, &s;hould be finally conclu&s;ive and obligatory, inde|pendant of the negociations of Aug&s;burg, for ad|ju&s;ting and terminating the conte&s;ts of Germany; and that the definitive treaty of peace between Great Britain and France, or at lea&s;t the prelimina|ries, &s;hould be concluded, &s;igned, and ratified by the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t.

In the mean time they gave Mr. Stanley to under&s;tand, that France would guarantee to England the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ca|nada, provided England would re&s;tore the i&s;land of Cape Breton, and confirm the right of French &s;ub|jects to take and cure fi&s;h in the Gulph of St. Lau|rence, as well as on the banks, and in the i&s;land of Newfoundland: that the fortifications of Loui&s;|bourg &s;hould be demoli&s;hed, and the harbour laid open: that Minorca &s;hould be re&s;tored to Great Britain, in exchange for the i&s;lands of Guadalupe and Mariegalante: that, with re&s;pect to the Ea&s;t-India affairs, the trea$y concluded in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-five, between the &s;ieur Godcheu and governor Saunders, &s;hould be confirmed; that in Africa, either Senegal or Goree &s;hould be re&s;tored to France; on which con&s;idera|tion the French king &s;hould evacuate Gottingen, He&s;&s;e&punc;Ca&s;&s;el, and the county of Hanau; withdraw his troops to the Rhine and the Maine, and leave no forces in Germany, but a number equal to that of the enemy which &s;hould remain in the Briti&s;h army a&s;&s;embled in We&s;tphalia. The&s;e articles were by no means agreeable to the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, who, by the canal of Mr. Stanley, &s;ignified that his Britannic maje&s;ty would not re&s;tore the i&s;land of Cape Breton upon any condition what&s;oever; and that France, in con&s;ideration of being allowed to fi&s;h on the banks of Newfoundland, &s;hould con|&s;ent to the demolition of Dunkirk.

If the&s;e principles are incon|te&s;tible, it will be proper to compare the time when the captures were made, with the date of the decla|ration of war; and no prize taken anterior to this declaration can be deemed legal, without overturn|ing the mo&s;t &s;acred of human in&s;titutions. Should it be alledged they were made by way of repri&s;al, for ho&s;tilities which the French had committed in Ame|rica, this objection was anticipated by ob&s;erving that there was no &s;ort of affinity between ho&s;tilities pre|tended to be commenced at Fort du Que&s;ne on the Ohio, and &s;hips taken trading among the i&s;lands of the We&s;t Indies: that &s;uch ho&s;tilities might be the motives of declaring war; but the effects could not take place before that declaration was publi&s;h|ed; and it would be unju&s;t to aggrieve innocent individuals, ignorant of the facts and circum&s;tances of remote ho&s;tilities which have kindled the flames of a general war between two nations. Moved by the&s;e con&s;iderations, the French king demanded an indemnification for his &s;ubjects, for the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained before the war commenced, withou pretending to reclaim his own &s;hips of war take$

before that declaration. Finally, he offered to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> guarantee the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent royal family to the throne of Great Britain; and propo&s;ed, that immediately after the ratification of the peace, the pri&s;oners on both &s;ides &s;hould be &s;et at liberty, and re-conveyed to their own country without ran&s;om. Together with this memorial, mon&s;ieur de Bu&s;&s;y<NOTE PLACE="marg">Memorial relating to Spain.</NOTE> delivered to the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, another of a very &s;ingular nature, importing, that the di&s;putes &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between Spain and England gave his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty cau&s;e to apprehend a new war in Europe and America, unle&s;s they could be now adju&s;ted: that the Spani&s;h monarch had commu|nicated to him the three points of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, namely, the re&s;titution of &s;ome &s;hips taken in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent war, under Spani&s;h colours; the liberty claimed by the Spani&s;h nation to fi&s;h on the banks of Newfoundland; and the de&s;truction of the &s;et|tlements made by the Engli&s;h on the Spani&s;h ter|ritories in the Bay of Honduras. Be&s;ides the&s;e points, the court of Madrid had lately given the French king to under&s;tand, that he had preten&s;ions to the neutral i&s;lands, which he would not fail to explain upon a proper occa&s;ion. His mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian&punc;maje&s;ty, therefore, pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired that the&s;e differences might be amicably terminated; and that the king of Spain &s;hould be invited to guarantee the treaty between the two crowns; be|cau&s;e, &s;hould they kindle up a new war, he &s;hould be obliged to perform his engagements to his al|lies. Whether this remon&s;trance was an expedient calculated to preponderate again&s;t the demand with re&s;pect to the demolition of Dunkirk, or really the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> effect of the French king's earne&s;t de&s;ire to e&s;ta|bli&s;h peace on the mo&s;t &s;olid foundation, we can|not pretend to determine. Perhaps, according to the opinion of &s;ome politicians, it was artfully thrown in as an ob&s;tacle to the peace, which the court of Ver&s;ailles never &s;incerely de&s;ired, or at lea&s;t was now rendered unnece&s;&s;ary by a more in|timate connection with Spain. Certain it is, the mini&s;ters of France had long been employing all their art and influence to in&s;pire the Spani&s;h mo|narch with jealou&s;y at the growing power of Great-Britain, her ab&s;olute empire at &s;ea, and her exten|&s;ive conque&s;ts in America; and it is equally certain that the&s;e intrigues, at the long run, an&s;wered the end propo&s;ed. The two French memorials were accompanied by a third notification, &s;ignifying, that the empre&s;s-queen had con&s;ented to a particular peace between France and England, on the&s;e terms, and the&s;e only: That France &s;hould, for her benefit, keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the countries belonging to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia: that the king of Great Britain, elector of Hanover, &s;hould afford no longer any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, either in troops or &s;ub&s;idies, to the Pru&s;|&s;ian monarch, in like manner as France &s;hould be re&s;tricted with re&s;pect to the empre&s;s-queen and her allies. If the&s;e in&s;inuations were intended to defeat the declared purpo&s;e of the negociation, they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejected with di&s;|dain by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try.</NOTE> could not have been better contrived. The court of London received them with di&s;dain, as in&s;ults upon the dignity and good faith of Great Britain. Mr. Secretary Pitt, in a letter to Mr. Bu&s;&s;y, de|clared his ma&s;ter would not &s;uffer the di&s;putes with Spain, to be intermingled in any &s;hape in the ne|gociation
<PB N="303" REF="3110">
for peace; that the bare mention of &s;uch<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> an idea would be con&s;idered as an affront; and that the memorial relating to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia could not be admitted without derogating from the honour of Great Britain, and that inviolable fidelity with which the king of England was determined to fulfil his engagements towards his allies. A memorial to the &s;ame purpo&s;e was tran&s;mitted to the court of Ver&s;ailles, couched in &s;uch high terms, as could not fail to give umbrage to a power re|markable for its pride and arrogance. Had the French king been in&s;incere in his profe&s;&s;ions, he was now furni&s;hed with the faire&s;t pretexts for breaking off the negociation. England in her demand relating to Dunkirk, had undoubtedly re|ceded from the fir&s;t agreement of treating on the <HI>$ti po&s;&s;idetis:</HI> &s;he had rejected, with di&s;dain, the &s;ole condition on which the allies of Lewis had agreed to a &s;eparate peace between France and Great Britain: &s;he had refu&s;ed with a mixture of indig|nation and contempt, the memorial relating to the di&s;putes with Spain; and Bellei&s;le being taken, France had nothing farther to fear from that quar|ter. This therefore was the juncture at which the mini&s;try of Ver&s;ailles might have broke off the conferences, without affording any ju&s;t handle for impeaching their &s;incerity. Yet this &s;tep they carefully avoided. To the la&s;t propo&s;als of Great-Britain, they an&s;wered by an ultimatum, in which they made new conce&s;&s;ions. They even conde|&s;cended to make an apology for having propo&s;ed a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the points in di&s;pute with Spain; and the conde de Fuentes, who re&s;ided as amba&s;&s;ador

"&mdash;I. The king of Great Britain &s;till in&s;i&s;ts upon the entire and total ce&s;&s;ion of Ca|nada and its dependencies, without any limits or exceptions what&s;oever; as al&s;o upon the full and final ce&s;&s;ion of Cape Breton, and all the other i&s;lands n the gulph of St. Laurence. Canada, according to the line of its limits traced by the marquis of Vaudrueil him&s;elf, when he, as governor-general, &s;urrendered that province, by capitulation, to the Engli&s;h general Amher&s;t, comprehends on one &s;ide, the lakes Huron, Michigan, and that called Superior; and the &s;aid line, drawn from the Red lake, embraces by a winding cour&s;e the river Oua|bache to its junction with the Ohio; from thence extending along this la&s;t river, inclu&s;ively to its confluence with the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.

With re&s;pect to the public profe&s;&s;ion and exerci&s;e of the Roman-catholic religion in Canada, his Britannic maje&s;ty will indulge his new &s;ubjects with that liberty, to be enjoyed withoutinterruption or mole&s;tation; and the French inhabitants or others who have been &s;ubject to the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian king in that country, &s;hall have entire freedom and op|portunity

As for the line drawn from Rio Perdido, contained in a notification delivered by mon&s;ieur de Bu&s;&s;y, on the eighteenth day of Augu&s;t concerning the limits of Loui&s;iana, his maje&s;ty cannot but reject &s;uch an unexpected propo&s;al, as altogether inadmi&s;&s;ible on the&s;e accounts: The &s;aid line, under colour of fixing the limits of Loui|&s;iana, includes in that province exten&s;ive countries, which, with the po&s;ts and forts that command them, the marquis de Vaudreuil hath &s;urrendered, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn capitulation, to his Britannick maje&s;ty, under the definition of Canada; of con&s;equence, however contentious the re&s;pective preten&s;ions of the two crowns might have been before the war, particularly with re&s;pect to the cour&s;e of the Ohio, and the territories adjacent, all the contending titles are, &s;ince the &s;urrender of Canada, and the line of its limits traced by the marquis de Vaudreuil, united, and without contradiction, become valid, in confirming to Great Britain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e countries, together with the other parts of Canada. The line propo&s;ed for a&s;certaining the limits of Loui&s;iana cannot be admitted, becau&s;e it would comprehend on the &s;ide of Carolina, very exten&s;ive countries and numerous nations, which have always been con&s;idered as under the protection

In the&s;e &s;entiments, his maje&s;ty, far from having pro|po&s;ed that France &s;hall be at liberty to &s;end armies into Sile&s;ia, "without being limited to the number &s;tipulated in her actual engagements with the court of Vienna," a propo&s;al to be found in no part of the ultimatum of England, he hath only declared, as the thirteenth article of the &s;aid ultimatum &s;hews, that Great Britain and France &s;hall be at liberty to &s;upport, as auxil$aries, their re&s;pective allies, in the particular di&s;pute for the recovery of Sile&s;ia, ac|cording to the engagements which each crown has contracted. The king declares, at the &s;ame time, that he has neither the intention nor the power to forbid and inhibit any foreign troops from entering into the &s;ervice and the pay of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, how&s;oever di&s;po&s;ed his maje&s;ty might be to con&s;ent that he &s;hall not furni&s;h, but in &s;ub&s;idies only, the &s;uccours which Great Britain &s;hall think proper, in conformity with her engagements, to afford his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty. With re&s;pect to the prizes taken after the commencement of ho&s;tilities, though be|fore the formality of declaring war, the king per|&s;i&s;ts in his opinion, that &s;uch a demand on the part of France, is neither ju&s;t nor defen&s;ible, according to the mo&s;t inconte&s;tible principles of the laws of war and of nations. As to the evacuation of O&s;tend and Nieuport, the king cannot help referring to the motives &s;ounded on the mo&s;t expre&s;s and irrevoc|able &s;tipulations in the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties, &s;peci|fied in the eleventh article of the ultimatum of Great Britain, and to his declaration relating to that &s;ubject; and his maje&s;ty confides in the good faith

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Final re|ply of France to the an|&s;wer of Great Britain.</NOTE> This an&s;wer, couched in &s;uch a peremptory &s;tile as could not but mortify the pride of France, might have been deemed another &s;ufficient excu&s;e for breaking off the negociation, had the court of Ver|&s;ailles wanted nothing more than a &s;pecious pretext for this purpo&s;e: but, after &s;everal fruitle&s;s con|ferences between the duke de Choi&s;eul and Mr. Stanley, the Brench mini&s;try thought proper to make further conce&s;&s;ions, in a new memorial to the court of London, dated on the ninth day of Sep|tember. In this paper the French king, after the preamble, declaring, that in ca&s;e the negociation &s;hould not &s;ucceed, all the conce&s;&s;ions made in the cour&s;e of it &s;hould be null and of no effect, pro|ceeds to this purpo&s;e: "The king has &s;aid in his fir&s;t memorial of propo&s;als, as well as in his ultima|tum,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> that he would cede and guarantee to Eng|land the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canada, in the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive form; his maje&s;ty repeats that offer; and even without di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the line of limits traced in a chart or map pre&s;ented by Mr. Stanley; as that line de|manded by England is doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive form that can be given to the ce&s;&s;ion, the king is willing to grant it, without further que&s;tion. His maje&s;ty had affixed four conditions to his guaran|tee: and to the&s;e England does not &s;eem aver&s;e: the king only thinks the term of one year too &s;hort for the emigration of the French and the &s;ale of their effects; and de&s;ires it may be protracted to two years, or eighteen months at lea&s;t. As the court of England has, in the fir&s;t article of its an|&s;wer relating to the entire and total ce&s;&s;ion, of Ca|nada, as agreed upon between the two courts, added the wo$d <HI>dependencies,</HI> it will be nece&s;&s;ary to explain what is meant by the word <HI>dependencies,</HI> that the ce&s;&s;ion may not produce di&s;putes in the &s;equel. The fir&s;t paragraph concerning the limits of Loui&s;iana, con|tained in the &s;econd article of England's an&s;wer, is allowed by France: the &s;econd paragraph is neither ju&s;t nor clearly expre&s;&s;ed; it is propo&s;ed therefore that it &s;hall be definitively explained in the following terms: "The intermediate Indian nations, &s;ituated between the lakes and the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, within the line de&s;cribed, &s;hall be neutral and independent, under the protection of the king of France; and tho&s;e without the line, on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;hall al&s;o be neutral and independent, under the protection of the king of England.

nations on either &s;ide of the line; but the &s;aid<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> nations &s;hall not be abridged of the liberty which they have hitherto enjoyed of trafficking with both French and Engli&s;h." Although France is very &s;en|&s;ible how contrary it is to the views of reconcilia|tion, for the party that cedes to propo&s;e to the party which has conquered, and means to pre&s;erve its conque&s;ts, the ce&s;&s;ion of countries which are not very well known; although this form of proceeding demanded by England, is without doubt &s;ubject to numberle&s;s difficulties, neverthele&s;s, the king, in order to demon&s;trate his readine&s;s to embrace every temperament tending to reconcile the two courts, freely declares to England, that he will guarantee to that crown the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Senegal and Goree, provided England will guarantee to France the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her &s;ettlements at Anamaboe and Acra. The fourth article of the an&s;wer comprehends &s;eve|ral objects, and each enquires a particular explana|tion. England &s;till joins together the liberty of fi&s;hing on part of the i&s;land of Newfoundland, &s;ti|pulated to France in the thirteenth article of the treaty of Utrecht, with the ninth article of the &s;ame treaty, relating to the demolition of Dunkirk. The fourth and la&s;t an&s;wer which &s;hall be given to Eng|land on this head, is, that the&s;e two &s;tipulations in treaty of Utrecht, have no other affinity, one with another, but that of their being both compri&s;ed in the &s;ame treaty; and that the conce&s;&s;ion ex|plained in favour of the French, in the thirteenth article of that treaty, is a compen&s;ation for the ce&s;&s;ion of Newfoundland and Annapolis Royal, made on the part of France to England, by the
<PB N="316" REF="3240">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> twelfth and thirteenth articles of the &s;ame treaty. But that the two courts may come to a right un|der&s;tanding on this &s;ubject, and in order to facilitate the peace, the king con&s;ents to demoli&s;h the works which have been made for the defence of the har|bour of Dunkirk &s;ince the beginning of that war, to fill up the ba&s;on which would contain &s;hips of war, and de&s;troy the buildings belonging to the rope-work; but, at the &s;ame time, his maje&s;ty will allow the merchant-harbour, which cannot receive even a frigate, to remain for the mutual advantage of England and France. He will engage that there &s;hall be no maritime, military e&s;tabli&s;hment in that &s;ea-port; but he will leave the wet ditch or lunette round the place, which was made for the &s;alubrity of the air and the health of the inhabitants. As to the fi&s;ning on the banks of Newfoundland, the king expects that the twelfth article in the treaty of Utrecht &s;hall be confirmed. In regard to the con|dition propo&s;ed by England, concerning the li|berty of fi&s;hing allowed to belong to the French, in the gulph of St. Laurence, France agrees, that, ex|clu&s;ive of the part of Newfoundland pre&s;cribed in the thirteenth article of the treaty of Utrecht, the French, except in ca&s;e of accident, &s;hall not come upon the coa&s;ts belonging to England&punc; in the gulph of St. Laurence, either to dry their fi&s;h or &s;pread their ne$s; but&punc; bating the&s;e two exceptions, the French &s;hall be at liberty to fi&s;h without mole&s;ta|tion, in eve$y part of the &s;aid gulph of St. Lau|rence. As to the ce&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land of St. Peter, the &s;mallne&s;s of that i&s;land, and its &s;ituation &s;o near Placentia, give the king rea&s;on to believe that &s;uch

a &s;helter would be altogether illu&s;ive, and &s;erve ra|ther<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 176</NOTE> to create di&s;putes between the two nations, than facilitate the fi&s;hery of the French &s;ubjects. The king had demanded of England the i&s;land of Cape Breton or St. John; he had even re&s;tricted him&s;elf to the incon&s;iderable i&s;land of Canceau; he now repeats the &s;ame propo&s;al to his Britannic ma|je&s;ty; or, if the king of England, for rea&s;ons un|known in France, cannot agree to the ce&s;&s;ion of Canceau; it is propo&s;ed he &s;hall add to the i&s;land of St. Peter, the ce&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land of Maquelon, or Michelon, two i&s;lands which, joined together, do not exceed three leagues in extent. Incon&s;ider|able as the&s;e &s;ettlements are, and though, properly &s;peaking, they form but one i&s;land, yet the king will accept of them, and even impo&s;e upon him&s;elf this condition&punc; That there &s;hall not be in either of the&s;e i&s;lands, nor in Canceau, provided England &s;hould part with this la&s;t, any military e&s;tabli&s;hment: France will only maintain a guard of fifty men to &s;upport the execution of the police, which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to maintain in tho&s;e i&s;lands. The king will, as much as po&s;&s;ible, con&s;idering the weakne&s;s of this guard, prevent all foreign ve&s;&s;els, even the Engli&s;h them&s;elves, from going a&s;hore on tho&s;e i&s;lands. France does not pretend to fi&s;h and dry cod on the coa&s;t of Newfoundland, in any other way but according to the &s;tipulation in the thir|teenth article of the treaty of Utrecht, provided it be under&s;tood that the French have liberty to take and dry their fi&s;h on the coa&s;t of St. Peter and Michelon. Finally, the king agrees that an Eng|li&s;h commi&s;&s;ary &s;hall re&s;ide in the &s;aid i&s;lands, to

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> &s;ee that the conditions &s;tipulated in the treaty &s;hall be punctually fulfilled. The divi&s;ion of the four neutral i&s;lands between the two courts, ought to be &s;pecified in the preliminaries: France agrees to any divi&s;ion of the&s;e i&s;lands that &s;hall be propo&s;ed by England, provided the i&s;land of St. Lucie &s;hall be declared part of the &s;hare a&s;&s;igned to France. The king, without &s;taying to di&s;pute particulars, con|&s;ents to the &s;ixth and &s;eventh articles, relating to the re&s;titution of Guadalupe, Marigalante, Bellei&s;le, and Minorca. As to the eighth article, relating to the evacuation of places in Germany, the king re|fers to the &s;eventh article of the ultimatum. It is not in his power to evacuate the countries belonging to his ally the empre&s;s-queen. The ninth article of England's an&s;wer requires explanation; for it is couched in &s;uch a manner, that the &s;en&s;e of it is not ea&s;ily under&s;tood: it &s;uppo&s;es engagements between the king and the empre&s;s, and between England and Pru&s;&s;ia, which are not mutually known to the two courts of Ver&s;ailles and London. It is not ima|gined in France, that the king of England has not influence to prevent the allies of his crown, &s;uch as the &s;overeigns of Hanover, He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, and Brun&s;|wic, from joining their troops to tho&s;e of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; but, without launching into u&s;ele&s;s di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions, the king, though determined, for the &s;ake of peace, to make the mo&s;t con&s;iderable &s;acrifices, is at the &s;ame time irrevocably re&s;olved, to grant nothing in the future treaty of peace, but what &s;hall be conformable to the &s;tipulations by which he is engaged with his allies. It is with &punc;their con&s;ent and concurrence that the king, in relation to the
<PB N="319" REF="3270">
war of We&s;tphalia, propo&s;ed to England the tenth<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 17$6.</NOTE> article of the memorial, containing his maje&s;ty's propo&s;als, and the &s;eventh and thirteenth articles of the ultimatum of France. The king adheres to the&s;e three articles, in an&s;wer to the eighth and ninth articles in the an&s;wer of England; re&s;olved, neverthele&s;s, to treat upon any new propo&s;als of England, relative to tho&s;e objects; propo&s;als which &s;hall be communicated to the king's allies, and ac|cepted by his maje&s;ty, with the con&s;ent of the em|pre&s;s, provided they &s;hall not be contrary to the en|gagements &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and that prin|ce&s;s.&mdash;France is &s;till of opinion, that the king's propo&s;als, relating to the prizes taken from his &s;ub|jects before the declaration of war, are &s;o ju&s;t, that he is obliged to &s;upport them, and refers him&s;elf on that head, to the twelfth article of his propo&s;als. The king, after the &s;igning of the treaty, or even of the preliminaries, will deliver to the king of Eng|land a paper &s;igned with his own hand, containing a declaration, that it never was his intention to unite the towns of O&s;tend and Nieuport to his do|minions. France will agree to the terms propo&s;ed for a ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, provided they are &s;uch as cannot be di&s;advantageous to either crown. France adopts the negociation between the Ea&s;t In|dia companies of the two nations, on condition that it &s;hall be terminated at the &s;ame time as that of the two crowns; for this purpo&s;e, they &s;hall name their commi&s;&s;ioners, and begin their negociation without lo&s;s of time. The fourteenth article, re|lating to the exchange of pri&s;oners, will meet with no difficulty: but the court of England will do

the French, and to the inroads of the Indians, ac|tuated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> by French influence. In the pro&s;ecution of the war, France was deprived of all Canada, and their influence of cour&s;e extingui&s;hed through all the Indian nations, inhabiting or bordering on that va&s;t country. The whole extent of the lakes, together with the cour&s;e of the river St. Laurence, including the i&s;lands &s;ituated in the gulph of St. Laurence, were united to the Briti&s;h dominion. Nothing now remained but the conque&s;t of Loui&s;iana, to confirm the &s;ecurity of the Engli&s;h colonies beyond all fear of alarm, to render all the Indian nations of N. America intirely dependant on the Briti&s;h govern|ment, and to engro&s;s the whole fur-trade of that immen&s;e continent. The&s;e purpo&s;es can never be an&s;wered while the French continue to have acce&s;s by the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, to the inland parts of America. The colony of Loui&s;iana, which at the commence|ment of the war was weak and incon&s;iderable, and might have been reduced by a handful of troops, without interfering with any other capital opera|tion, is now con&s;iderably &s;trengthened and rein|forced; and, no doubt, will every day encrea&s;e in wealth, extent, and number of people.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1761.</NOTE> reader may judge of the importance of Loui&s;iana, which hath been left unattempted by the arms of Great Britain; and &s;o tamely overlooked in the cour&s;e of the negociation. The fi&s;hery in the gulph of St. Laurence, and on the banks of Newfound|land, con&s;tituted one great &s;ource of wealth to France, and was undoubtedly her chief nur&s;ery for &s;eamen; con&s;equently the lo&s;s of it mu&s;t have been &s;everely felt in that nation: but the Engli&s;h m&mdash;y voluntarily offered to readmit her to a participation of this advantage, which, we will ven|ture to &s;ay, was more than equivalent to all that &s;he forfeited by the entire ce&s;&s;ion of Canada. The produce of Guadelupe is more than three times the value of what Canada adds to the wealth of Great Britain; yet the crown of E&mdash;agreed without he&s;itation to re&s;tore this opulent and important ac|qui&s;ition. If &s;uch e&s;&s;ential &s;acrifices were made on both &s;ides, what then ob&s;tructed the pacification?&mdash;The French king declared he could not give up We&s;el in Germany, which he had garri&s;oned in the name of the empre&s;s queen; a place which the king of Pru&s;&s;ia had of him&s;elf abandoned: and the Briti&s;h government refu&s;ed to re&s;tore tho&s;e mer|chant-&s;hips which had been taken before the decla|ration of war.

The an&s;wer is ob|vious. The progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h conque&s;ts, and the imperative manner in which they dictated the terms of peace, had, by this time, effectually ar|rou&s;ed the jealou&s;y and di&s;gu&s;t of the court of Ma|drid, which being moreover convinced of the French king's moderation, offered to &s;upply him with pecuniary &s;uccours; and the&s;e were all that he wanted to maintain a war in Germany, by which he well knew Great Britain would be in a few years utterly impoveri&s;hed. In that ca&s;e he fore&s;aw England would be expo&s;ed to a new war with Spain, which could not fail to encrea&s;e her incumbrances; and that, in the pro&s;ecution of &s;uch accumulated ho&s;ti|lities again&s;t her, he &s;hould probably recover &s;ome of the territories &s;he had &s;ubdued.&mdash;That this was not meer conjecture appeared from the conduct of Spain, which, from this period, &s;eemed to provoke a rupture with Great Britain. In accounting for the conduct of princes, we mu&s;t not always look for national motives. The ties of con&s;anguinity, or other private connections, have not unfrequently preponderated again&s;t the intere&s;t of a whole king|dom.

Some regard was likewi&s;e due to the following con|&s;iderations. England, at this period, derived con|&s;iderable advantages from her trade with Spain. A great number of Briti&s;h merchants and factors were &s;ettled in different parts of that kingdom, and concerned in the remittances by the &s;lota from the We&s;t-Indies: all the&s;e would have been inevitably ruined by a precipitation of ho&s;tilities.

Notwith&s;tanding this abrupt &s;ece&s;&s;ion, the king, with a genero&s;ity peculiar to him&s;elf, gratified him for his pa&s;t &s;ervices with a yearly pen&s;ion of three thou&s;and pounds, to be continued even after his decea&s;e, during the &s;urvivancy of his lady and &s;on; and this gratuity was reinforced with the title of barone&s;s of Chatham to his lady, and that of baron to her heirs male, Mr. Pitt for his own per&s;on declining the di&s;tinction of nobility. This event excited &s;uch a loud clamour as had not been heard &s;ince the trial of admiral Byng. It divided the nation into violent factions, and deluged the public with inundations of pamphlets, papers, and pa&s;quinades. The friends and admirers of Mr. P&mdash;exclaimed, that after he had rai&s;ed the nation from the lowe&s;t &s;tate of contempt and de&s;pondency, to the highe&s;t pinnacle of glory and exultation, he was ungratefully thwarted in his de&s;igns for the public good, and thru&s;t from the helm at the mo&s;t critical juncture, by a cabal of wicked and worth|le&s;s men, who&s;e mi&s;conduct had formerly brought the common-wealth to the verge of ruin. They expatiated upon the wonderful talents of the late mini&s;ter: they enumerated the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Bri i&s;h arms during the period of his admini&s;tra|tion: they a&s;cribed them wholly and &s;olely to the $$&s;dom of his plans and the vigour of his coun|&s;els:

The populace not only rent the air with their &s;houts, but expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of un|yoking his hor&s;es, that they might draw, by force of arm, the chariot of their beloved mini&s;ter. The &s;ame demon&s;trations of particular veneration were indu&s;triou&s;ly repeated in the &s;equel of the enter|tainment, and in the return of their maje&s;ties to St. James's; nor did the &s;curril herd of low ple|beians refrain from exclamations of di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t an unblemi&s;hed nobleman, &s;uppo&s;ed to enjoy a di|&s;tingui&s;hed &s;hare of his &s;overeign's confidence and e&s;teem.

Such a commotion could not fail to clog the wheels of government, ob&s;truct the public &s;er|vice, and might perhaps have &s;ome effect in al$e|nating the affections of the &s;ubjects. They were of opinion that his accepting a pen&s;ion and title did violence to the delicacy of his character, as a di&s;intere&s;ted patriot, which character had been the &s;ubject of repeated encomium, and the theme of general admiration.

&s;he was treated with want of decorum.

The earl of Bri&s;tol proceeded with delicacy and caution, and did not in&s;i&s;t upon a categorical an&s;wer until every milder method had been tried without &s;ucce&s;s. The mo&s;t extraordinary circum&s;tance attending this rupture was the purport of a paper <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Trar&s;lation of a Note delivered to the Earl of Egremont by the Count de Fuentes, Amba&s;&s;ador at the Court of London from the Court of Spain, December <HI>25, 1761.</HI></P>
<P>"The count de Fuentes, the Catholic king's amba&s;&s;a|dor to his Britannic maje&s;ty, has ju&s;t received a courier from his court, by whom he is informed, that my lord Bri&s;tol, his Britannic maje&s;|ty's amba&s;&s;ador at the court of Madrid, has &s;aid to his excellency Mr. Wall, mini&s;ter of &s;tate, that he had orders to demand a po&s;itive and ca|tegorical an&s;wer to this que&s;|tion, viz. "If Spain thinks of allying her&s;elf with France again&s;t England;" and to de|clare, at the &s;ame time, that he &s;hould take a refu&s;al to his demand for an aggre&s;&s;ion and declaration of war; and that he &s;hould, in con&s;e|quence, be obliged to retire from the court of Spain. The above mini&s;ter of &s;tate an|&s;wered him, that &s;uch a &s;tep could only be &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;pirit of haughtine&s;s and di&s;cord, which, for the mi&s;|fortune of mankind, &s;till reigns but too much in the Briti&s;h government: that it was in that very moment that the war was declared, and the king's dignity violently at|tacked, and that he might retire how and when he &s;hould think perfect.</P>
<P>"The count de Fuentes is, in con&s;equence, ordered to leave the court and the do|minions of England; and to declare to the Briti&s;h king, to the Engli&s;h nation, and to the whole univer&s;e, that the horrors into which the Spa|ni&s;h and Engli&s;h nations are going to plunge them&s;elves, mu&s;t be attributed only to the pride, and to the un|mea&s;urable ambition of him who has held the reins of the government, and who ap|pears &s;till to hold them, al|though by another hand: that if his Catholic maje&s;ty excu&s;ed him&s;elf from an&s;wer|ing on the treaty in que&s;tion between his Catholic maje&s;ty and his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;|ty, which is believed to have been &s;igned the fifteenth of Augu&s;t, and wherein it is pretended, there are condi|tions relative to England, he had very good rea&s;ons: fir&s;t, the king's dignity required him to manife&s;t his ju&s;t re|&s;entment of the little ma|nagement, or, to &s;peak more properly, of the in&s;ulting manner with which all the affairs of Spain have been treated during Mr. Pitt&punc;s $word$ who&punc; finding him&s;elf convinced of the ju&s;|tice, which &s;upported the king in his preten&s;ions, his ordinary and la&s;t an&s;wer was, That he would not relax in any thing till the Tower of London was taken &s;word in hand.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, his maje&s;ty was much &s;hocked to hear the haughty and imperious tone, with which the contents of the tr aty were demanded of him: if the re&s;pect due to royal maje&s;ty had been re|garded, explanations might have been had without any difficulty: the mini&s;ters of Spain might have &s;aid frank|ly to tho&s;e of England, what the count de Fuentes, by the king's expre&s;s order&punc; declares publicly, viz. That the &s;aid treaty is only a convention between the family of Bour|bon, wherein there is nothing which has the lea&s;t relation to the pre&s;ent war: that there is in it an article for the mu|tual guaranty of the domi|nions of the two &s;overeigns: but it is &s;pecified therein, that that guaranty is not to be under&s;tood but of the do|minions which &s;hall remain to France, after the pre&s;ent war &s;hall be ended; that al|though his Catholic maje&s;ty might have had rea&s;on to think him&s;elf offended by the irregular manner in which the memorial was returned to M. de Bu&s;&s;y, mini&s;ter of France, which he had pre|&s;ented for terminating the differences of Spain and Eng|land, at the &s;ame time with the war between this la&s;t and France; he has, however, di&s;&s;embled, and from an ef|fect of his love of peace, cau&s;ed a memorial to be de|livered to my lord Bri&s;tol, wherein it is evidently de|mon&s;trated, that the &s;tep of France, which put the mi|ni&s;ter Pitt into &s;o bad hu|mour, did not at all offend either the laws of neutrality, or the &s;incerity of the two &s;overeigns: that further, from a fre&s;h proof of his pacific &s;pirit, the king of Spain wrote to the king of France, his cou&s;in, that if the union of intere&s;t in any manner re|tarded the peace with Eng|land, he con&s;ented to &s;epa|rate him&s;elf from it, not to put any ob&s;tacle to &s;o great a happine&s;s: but it was &s;oon &s;een that this was only a pre|tence on the part of the Eng|li&s;h mini&s;ter; for that of France continuing his nego|tiation without making any mention of Spain, and pro|po&s;ing conditions very advan|tageous and honourable for England, the mini&s;ter Pitt, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the univer&s;e, rejected them with di&s;dain, and &s;hewed at the &s;ame time his ill-will again&s;t Spain, to the &s;candal of the &s;ame Briti&s;h council; and unfortunately he has &s;ec|ceeded but too far in his per|nicious de&s;ign.</P>
<P>This declaration made, the count de Fuentes de&s;ires his excellency my lord Egremont to pre&s;ent his mo&s;t humble re&s;pects to his Britannic ma|je&s;ty, and to obtain for him pa&s;&s;ports, and all other faci|lities, for him, his family, and all his retinue, to go out of the dominions of Great Britain without any trouble, and to go by the &s;hort pa&s;|&s;age of the &s;ea, which &s;epa|rates them from the conti|nent."</P>

<P>"The earl of Egrement, his Britannic maje&s;ty's &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate, having received from his excellency the count de Fuentes, amba&s;&s;ador of the Catholic king at the court of London a paper, in which, be&s;ides the notification of his $word$ and the demand of the nece&s;&s;ary pa&s;&s;ports to go out of the king's dominions, he has thought proper to enter into what has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed be|tween the two courts, with a view to make that of London appear as the &s;ource of all the misfortunes which may en&s;ue from the rupture which $word$ happened; in order that $$body may be mi&s;led by the declaration, which his excel|lency has been plea&s;ed to make to the king, to the Engli&s;h nation, and to the whole univer&s;e; notwith|&s;tanding the in&s;inuation, as void of foundation as of de|cency, of the &s;pirit of haugh|tine&s;s and of di&s;cord, which, his excellency pretends, reigns in the Briti&s;h government, to the mi$fortune of mankind; and notwith&s;tanding the irre+gularity and indecency of ap|pealing to the Engli&s;h na|tion, as if it could be &s;epa|rated from its king, for whom the mo&s;t determined &s;enti|ments of love, of duty, and of confidence, are engraved in the hearts of all his &s;ub|jects; the &s;aid earl of Egre|mont, by his maje&s;ty's ortier, laying a&s;ide, in this an&s;wer&punc; all &s;pirit of declamation and of har&s;hne&s;s, avoiding every offen&s;ive word, which might hurt the dignity of &s;overeigns, without &s;tooping to invec|tives again&s;t private per&s;ons, will confine him&s;elf to facts with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous ex|actne&s;s: and it is from this repre&s;entation of facts, that he appeals to all Europe, and to the whole univer&s;e, for the purity of the king's inten|tions, and for the &s;incerity of the wi&s;hes his maje&s;ty has not cea&s;ed to make, as well as for the moderation he has always &s;hewed, though in vain, for the maintenance of friend&s;hip and good under&s;tanding be|tween the Briti&s;h and Spani&s;h nations.</P>
<P>The king having received undoubted informations, that the court of Madrid had &s;e|cretly contracted engage|ments with that of Ve$&s;$$$$es, which the mini&s;ters of France laboured to repre&s;ent, in all the courts of Europe, as of|fen&s;ive to Great Britain; and combining the&s;e appearances with the &s;tep, which the court of Spain had, a little time be|fore, taken towards his ma|je&s;ty, in avowing its con&s;ent (though that avowal had been followed by apologies) to the memorial pre&s;ented the 23d of July, by the &s;ieur de Bu&s;&s;y, mini&s;ter plenipotentiary of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian king, to the king's &s;ecretary of &s;tate; and his maje&s;ty having after|wards received intelligence, &s;carce admitting a doubt, of troops marching, and of mi|litary preparations making in all the ports of Spain, judged that his dignity as well as his prudence, required him to order his amba&s;&s;ador at the court of Madrid, by a di&s;patch, dated the 28th of October, to demand, in terms the mo&s;t mea&s;ured however, and the mo&s;t amicable, a communication of the treaty recently concluded between the courts of Madrid and Ver&s;ailles, or at lea&s;t of the articles which might relate to the intere&s;ts of Great Bri|tain; and, in order to avoid every thing, which could be thought to imply the lea&s;t &s;light of the dignity, or even the delicacy, of his Catholic maje&s;ty, the earl of Bri&s;$ol was authori&s;ed to content him&s;elf with a&s;&s;urances, in ca&s;e the Catholic king offered to give any, that the &s;aid engagements did not contain any thing that was contrary to the friend&s;hip which &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between the two crowns, or that was prejudicial to the intere&s;ts of Great Britain, &s;uppo&s;ing that any difficulty was made of &s;hewing the treaty. The king could not give a le&s;s equivocal proof of his dependance on the good faith of the Catholic king, than in &s;hewing him an un|bounded confidence in &s;o im|portant an affair, and which &s;o e&s;&s;entially intere&s;ted his own dignity, the good of his kingdoms, and the happine&s;s of his people.</P>
<P>How great, then, was the king's &s;urprize, when, in&s;tead of receiving the ju&s;t &s;atisfac|tion, which he had a right to expect, he learnt from his amba&s;&s;ador, that, having ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the mini&s;|ter of Spain for that purpo&s;e, he could only draw from his a refu&s;al to give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to his maje&s;ty's ju&s; requi&s;itions, which he has accompanied with terms that breathed nothing but haugh|tine&s;s, animo&s;ity, and me|nace; and which &s;eemed &s;o &s;trongly to verify the &s;u&s;pi|cions of the unamicable di&s;|po&s;ition of the court of Spain, that nothing le&s;s than his maje&s;ty's moderation, and his re&s;olution taken to make all the efforts po&s;&s;ible to avoid the misfortunes in&s;eparable from a rupture, could deter|mine him to make a la&s;t trial, by giving orders to his am|ba&s;&s;ador to addre&s;s him&s;elf to the mini&s;ter of Spain, to de|&s;ire him to inform him of the intentions of the court of Madrid towards that of Great Britain in this conjuncture, if they had taken engage|ments, or formed the de&s;ign to join the king's enemies in the pre&s;ent war, or to depart, in any manner, from the neu|tality they had hitherto ob|&s;erved; and to make that mini&s;ter &s;en&s;ible, that, if they per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing all &s;ati&s;|faction on demands &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;o intere&s;t|ing, the king could not but con&s;ider &s;uch a refu&s;al as the mo&s;t au$hentick avowal, that Spain had taken her part, and that there only remained for his maje&s;ty to take the mea&s;ures which his royal pru|dence &s;hould dictate for the honour and dignity of his crown, and for the pro&s;pe|rity and protection of his people; and to recal his am|ba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>Unhappily for the public tranquillity, for the intere&s;t of the two nations, and for the good of mankind, this la&s;t &s;tep was as fruitle&s;s as the preceding ones; the Spa|ni&s;h mini&s;ter, keeping no fur|ther mea&s;ures, an&s;wered dri|ly, "That it was in that very moment that the war was declared, and the king's dig|nity attacked, and that the earl of Bri&s;tol might retire how, and when, he &s;hould think proper."</P>
<P>And in order to &s;et in its true light the declaration, "That, if the re&s;pect due to his Catholick maje&s;ty had been regarded, explanations might have been had without any difficulty; and that the mini&s;ters of Spain might have &s;aid frankly, as Mon&s;. de Fuentes, by the king's expre&s;s order, declares publicly, that the &s;aid treaty is only a con|vention between the family of Bourbon; wherein there is nothing which has the lea&s;t relation to the pre&s;ent war; and that the guaranty, which is therein &s;pecified, is not to be under&s;tood but of the do|minions which &s;hall remain to France after the war:" it is declared, that, very far from $span$ being want|ing to the re&s;pect&punc; acknow|ledged to be due to crowned $word$ the in$tructions given to the earl of Br$&s;t$l $span$ to make the $span$ $he $span$ of the $word$ between the $span$ and Ver+&s;ai$$$$, with all the decency, and all the attention po&s;&s;ible; and the $span$ was not made till $word$ $word$ and the mo&s;t $span$ to give the $word$ $word$ and at the $word$ $word$ therefore, if $span$ ever had $span$ this &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary $word$ $word$ they had not the $word$ rea&s;on, that $word$ $o have engaged them $word$ $word$ it to the $span$ when $span$ be of u&s;e. $span$ the terms&punc; $word$ which the declara|tion $span$ are us the $span$ not having received $span$ for it appears at $word$ &s;ight, that the an&s;wer is not at all conformable to the demand: we wanted to be informed, <HI>if the court of Spain $word$ to join the French, our enemies, to make war on Great Britain, or to a&punc;part from their neutrality:</HI> whereas the an&s;wer concerns one treaty only, which is &s;aid to be of the 15th of Augu&s;t, carefully avoiding to &s;ay the $word$ word that c$uid explain, in any $span$ the $word$ of Spain towards Great $word$ or the further engagements they may have contracted in the pre&s;ent $word$.</P>

In a word Martinique is the mo&s;t populous and flouri&s;hing of all the colonies which the French nation po&s;&s;e&s;s in America. Its towns and harbours are &s;trongly fortified: the country it&s;elf is rendered extreme|ly difficult of acce&s;s by woods, pa&s;&s;e$, rivers, rocks, and ravines; defend$d by a body of regul$r troops, and reinforced by a di&s;ciplined militia, &s;a$d to con&s;i&s;t of ten thou&s;and white natives, be&s;ides $our times that number of negroes, whom they can arm in ca&s;es of emergency. The reduction of this i&s;land was an object of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to Great Britain, not only on account of its own in|trin&s;ic worth, and the det$iment which the le&s;s of it mu&s;t occa&s;ion to the enemy, but likewi&s;e $or the &s;ecurity of the Engli&s;h i&s;lands, among&s;t which it is &s;ituated, and of the Briti&s;h trading &s;hips, which were terr$bly annoyed by the privateers of M$$ti|nique.</P>

The general, however, judg|ing this an improper place for a di&s;embarkation, two brigades, commanded by the brigadiers Havi|land and Grant, were detached under convoy to the bay of Petite-An&s;e, where a battery was cannonaded and taken by the &s;eamen and marines. The&s;e bri|gades were &s;oon followed by the whole army, and the re&s;t of the &s;quadron; and other batteries being &s;ilenced, general Monckton and the forces landed without further oppo&s;ition on the &s;ixteenth, in the neighbourhood of the Cas des Navires. The bri|gadiers Haviland and Grant had made a de&s;cent in the other place, and marched to the ground oppo|&s;ite to Pigeon-I&s;land, which commands the har|bour of Fort-Royal: but the road being found impa&s;&s;able for artillery, Mr. Monckton altered his fir&s;t de&s;ign. The two brigades, however, with the light infantry under lieutenant-colonel Scot, while they remained on &s;hore, were attacked in the night by a body of grenadiers, freeboo$ers, negroes, and mulattoes, who had been &s;ent over from Fort-Royal; but they met with &s;uch a warm reception as compelled them to retreat with precipitation&punc; after having &s;u&s;tained &s;ome lo&s;s.</P>

<PB N="366" REF="3760">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> to defend to the la&s;t extremity. The Eng|li&s;h commander, having erected a battery to favour the pa&s;&s;age of a ravine which &s;eparated him from tho&s;e heights, made a di&s;po&s;ition for the attack, which was put in execution on the twenty-fourth day of January. In the dawn of the morning, brigadier Grant, at the head of the grenadiers, &s;up|ported by lord Rollo's brigade, attacked the ad|vanced po&s;ts of the enemy, under a br$&s;k fi$e of the batteries; while brigadier R$fane with his bri|gade, reinforced by the marines, marched up on the right to attack the redoubts that were rai&s;ed along the &s;hore; and the light infantry under colonel Scot, &s;upported by the brigade of Wal&s;h, advanced on the left of a plantation, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to turn the enemy. They &s;ucceeded in their attempt, while the grenadiers were engaged in driving the French from one po&s;t to another; and this motion contributed in a great mea&s;ure to the &s;ucce&s;s of the day. By nine in the morning they were in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the Morne To$tue&s;on, and all the redoubts and batteries with which it was fortified. The ene|my retired in con$u&s;ion to the town of Fort-Royal, and to the Morne Garnier, which, being more high and inacce&s;&s;ible than the other, was deemed im|practicable. During the conte&s;t for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Tortue&s;on, brigadier Haviland, at the head of his brigade, with two battalions of highlanders, and another corps of light infantry under major Leland, was ordered to pa&s;s the ravine a good $ay to the left, and turn a body of the enemy po&s;ted on the oppo&s;ite heights, in hope of being able to divide their forces; but the country was &s;o difficult
<PB N="367" REF="3770">
of acce&s;s, that it was late before this pa&s;&s;age was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> effected. In the mean time, the general, per|ceiving the enemy giving way on all &s;ides, ordered colonel Scot's light in&s;antry, with Wal&s;h's brigade, and a divi&s;ion of the grenadiers, to advance on the left to a plantation, from whence they drove the enemy, and where they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an ad|vantageous po&s;t oppo&s;ite to the Morne Garnier. They were &s;upported on the right by Haviland's corps, when they pa&s;&s;ed the ravine; and the road between the two plantations, which they occupied, was covered by the marines. Next day the Eng|li&s;h began to erect batteries again&s;t the citadel of Fort-Royal; but were greatly annoyed from Morne Garnier. On the twenty-&s;eventh, about four in the afternoon, the enemy made a furious atttack, with the greate&s;t part of their forces, on the po&s;ts occupied by the light infantry and brigadier Havi|land; but were handled &s;o roughly, that they &s;oon retired in di&s;order. Such was the a$dour of the Engli&s;h troops, that they pa&s;&s;ed the ravine with the $ugitives, &s;eized their batteries, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground, being &s;upported by the brigade of Wal&s;h and the grenadiers under Grant, who march|ed up to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance when the attack began. Major Leland, with his light infantry, finding no re&s;i&s;tance on the left, advanced to the redoubt which was abandoned; and the brigadiers Wal&s;h, Grant, and Haviland, moved up in order to &s;up|port him; &s;o that by nine at night the Briti&s;h troops were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this very &s;trong po&s;t, that commanded the citadel, again&s;t which their own artillery was turned in the morning. The
<PB N="368" REF="3780">
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> French regular troops had fled into the town, and the militia di&s;per&s;ed in the country. The gover|nor of the citadel, perceiving the Engli&s;h em|ployed in erecting batteries on the different heights by which he was commanded, ordered the c$$made to be beat, and &s;urrendered the place by capitula|tion. On the fourth of February the gate of the citadel was delivered up to the Engli&s;h; and $$xt morning the garri&s;on, to the number of eight hun|dred, marched out with the honours of war. Im|mediately after the reduction of Fort-Royal, depu|tations were &s;ent from different quarters of the i&s;land, de&s;iring a capitulation: but the governor-general, Mr. de la Touche, retired with his forces to St. Pierre, which he propo&s;ed to defend with un|common vigour. On the &s;eventh, Pidgeon-I&s;land, which was &s;trongly fortified, and counted one of the be&s;t defences of the harbour, &s;urrendered at the fir&s;t &s;ummons, and obtained a capitulation &s;imilar to that of the citadel. It was agreed, that the troops of the French king &s;hould be tran&s;ported to Rochfort in France; that the mi$itia &s;hould lay down their arms, and remain pri&s;oners of war, untii the fate of the i&s;land &s;hould be determined. The&s;e &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es were obtained at the &s;mall expence of about four hundred men, including a few offi|cers, killed and wounded in the different attacks; but the lo&s;s of the enemy was much more con&s;i|derable. The mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance of this enterprize was the &s;urpri&s;ing boldne&s;s and ala|crity of the &s;eamen, who, by force of arm, drew a number of heavy mortars and &s;hips cannon up the &s;teepe&s;t mountains to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance

from the &s;ea, and acro&s;s the enemy's line of fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> to which they expo&s;ed them&s;elves with amazing indifference. Fourteen French privateers were found in the harbour of Port-Royal; and a much greater number, from other ports in the i&s;land, were delivered up to admiral Rodney, in con&s;e|quence of the capitulation with the inhabitants, who, in all other re&s;pects, were very favourably treated.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reducti|on of the whole i&s;land.</NOTE> Ju&s;t when general Monckton was ready to em|bark for the reduction of St. Pierre, a very large and flouri&s;hing town, &s;ituated to leeward of Fort-Royal, two deputies arrived with propo&s;als of ca|pitulation for the whole i&s;land on the part of Mr. de la Touche, the governor general. On the fourteenth the terms were &s;ettled, and the capitu|lation &s;igned: on the &s;ixteenth the Engli&s;h com|mander took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of St. Pierre, and all the po&s;ts in that neighbourhood; while the governor-general, with Mr. Rouille, the lieutenant-governor, the &s;taff officers, and about three hundred and twenty grenadiers, were embarked in tran&s;ports, to be conveyed to France. That &s;uch an important conque&s;t &s;hould be atchieved almo&s;t without blood|&s;hed, was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the favour|able capitulation which the i&s;land of Guadaloupe had obtained, and the good faith with which the articles of that capitulation had been ob&s;erved by the conquerors. Indeed, the inhabitants of Marti|nique, who were indulged with nearly the &s;ame terms, mu&s;t have found them&s;elves con&s;iderably gainers by their change of &s;overeign; ina&s;much as, together with the enjoyment of their own reli|gion,

By the reduction of Martinique, the i&s;land of Antigua, St Chri&s;topher's, and Nevis, together with the &s;hips trading to the&s;e colonies, are perfectly &s;ecured again&s;t the depredations of the enemy; and Great Britain acquires an annual addi|tion in commerce, at lea&s;t, to the amount o$ one mil|lion &s;terling. While general Monckton was em|ployed in regulating the capitulation of this i&s;land, commodore Swanton &s;ailed with a &s;mall &s;quadron to the i&s;le of Grenade, which, with &s;ome others po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the French, depends upon Martinique, and in all probability would &s;ubmit without oppo|&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>General Barrington.</HEAD>
<P>Art. 1. There were only one hundred and fifty high-landers, that joined us at Bar|badoes: the greate&s;t part of the re&s;t did not arrive till the day before we landed at Gua|daloupe; and one company did not come till a &s;quadron was &s;ent to attack Fort Louis. They joined it off of that place, and landed with the marines. This was about three weeks after we came to Ba&s;&s;e-terre.</P>
<P>It is not denied that the returns of the army, when we arrived at Barbadoes, amounted to five thou&s;and eight hundred men: but it will appear al&s;o, by the re|turns, that no more were landed at Martinique than four thou&s;and four hundred and &s;ixty-eight men.</P>

<P>Art. 2. In regard to the commodore's offer of draw|ing the artillery, &amp;c.

<P>"It was &s;oon after the troops were ordered for re-imbarking from off the i&s;land of Martinico, that I was made acquainted with the motives which induced the general for taking &s;uch a &s;tep: I then under&s;tood the me&s;&s;age from the general to commodore Moore was, that if he, the commodore, could make an attack with his fleet, or land the artillery, &s;tores, and pro|vi&s;ions, &amp;c. nearer Fort Royal, the army, at all events, &s;hould march the next morning to inve&s;t the place; if not, boats to be &s;ent on &s;hore in the evening, for the troops to be taken on board. His an&s;wer was, that they could not be landed nearer, or at any other place, than where the troops landed; and he would un|dertake, with his &s;ailors, to land them there. But at a meeting of the general offi|cers, the next morning, on board of his &s;hip&punc; he then &s;aid that his me&s;&s;age was, that he not only offered to land them at the place before mentioned, but likewi&s;e to tran&s;port them wherever the &s;ervice might require. This much &s;urpri&s;ed general Hop|&s;on&punc; and all the other general officers, who never took his an&s;wer in that &s;en&s;e. Being a&s;ked, what number of men he could &s;pare from the fleet for that &s;ervice, he mentioned four, or at mo&s;t &s;ix hundred men, which was known to be greatly in&s;ufficient.</P>
<P>As for the chief engineer, giving his opinion again&s;t his maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war attack|ing Fort Royal on the i&s;land of Guadaloupe, I am certain he continued in the &s;ame &s;en|timents after the attack was made, and the place aban|doned; and I &s;hould not do ju&s;tice to his character, were I of any other: for as the fort was on an eminence, it rendered their fire but of a very immaterial &s;ervice towards reducing it, there being not a gun di&s;mounted, nor much damage done to any capital work; nor did the enemy quit the fort, o$ cea&s;e firing, till the morning after the attack was made. They were &s;en&s;ible of no$ being able to hold out forty eight hours after the troops made good their landing. As it was commanded by heights, I think it would not have taken more time to have re|duced it; and of con&s;equence they mu&s;t have weakened their own &s;trength, by leav|ing a &s;ufficient number of men for garri&s;oning the place, to be taken pri&s;oners.</P>

In con&s;equence of this delay, it was found extremely difficult to di&s;po&s;e of the men for that night, as it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for them to find their re&s;pec|tive tran&s;ports in the dark: but this difficulty was &s;ur|mounted by the commodore, who di&s;tributed them among the &s;hips of war.

The whole of the road from the &s;ea to the Dos d'Ane, which is near $word$ miles, is &s;o narrow, that, in many places, not above three men could march in fl$$t, and mo&s;t part of it very rocky and &s;teep.</P>

<P>When the marines had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fort Louis, Mr. Moore, at the de&s;ire of general Hop&s;on, went on board the Panther, accom|panied by colonel Clavering, to reconnoitre the coa&s;t, and fixed upon a landing-place near Arnonville, where the troops were actually di&s;em|barked.</P>

Had even all the&s;e difficulties been &s;ur|mounted, there were &s;till more to encounter, if po&s;&s;ible, of a &s;tronger nature; I mean the redoubt, without which, our being ma&s;ters of the Dos d'Ane would not have been of the lea&s;t &s;ervice, and which we mu&s;t have abandoned, as it would have been next to impo&s;&s;ible to have &s;upplied that po&s;t with provi&s;ions.</P>

A trader of St. Eu&s;tatia offered to &s;up|ply the commodore with ten thou&s;and barrels of beef, at an under-price, declaring, without &s;cruple, that the Bri|ti&s;h crui&s;ers had effectually prevented him from di&s;po&s;ing of it at any French market. Be&s;ides, the inhabitants of Guadalupe would have been chargeable with the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity, had they collected magazines of provi&s;ion in the defencele&s;s town of Mahaut, &s;ituated at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the centre of their po&s;ts, while the enemies had it in their power to cut off the communication: but, if they had, it would have reflected no blame upon the commo|dore, who had done every thing in the power of &s;hips to prevent it.</P>

<P>Mr. Moore is very much mi&s;taken, when he &s;ays that it was an improper place for a magazine: it was, as near as could be, in the center of the two i&s;lands, and as far removed as po&s;&s;ible, con|&s;i&s;tent with &s;afety and conve|nience, from the enemy.

<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"In an&s;wer to the letter you have done us the honour to write, relating to &s;everal circum&s;tances concerning the &s;iege of Guadaloupe, of which you require the true &s;tate, as we were eye-witne&s;&s;es of what pa&s;&s;ed; Mr. Vidal having acted, during the &s;iege, as a captain of the hor&s;e-militia, and at the beginning of the &s;iege as aid-du-camp to the governor; and Mr. Des Hayes as captain in the infantry-mi|litia.</P>
<P>We declare, Sir, that, with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t article of your letter, what you alledge is very true, in regard to the difficulty of the road by the &s;ea-&s;ide, leading to the gene|ral quarters, as well as that of the Dos d'Ane: this la&s;t is &s;o &s;teep and narrow, al|mo&s;t through its whole ex|tent, which is about four thou&s;and paces, or four Eng|li&s;h miles, that three men can &s;carce march a-brea&s;t; and in many places it is &s;o incumbered with &s;tones as to be ab&s;olutely impracticable. Moreover, it was the more difficult to be forced, as en|trenchments had been made, and po&s;ts fortified the whole length of the road; as at Bi&s;dary, Vaubelle, la Batterie Mutine, the Je&s;uits, the Ho&s;|pital, and, la&s;tly, the guard at the general quarters; and above all this, the grand camp mounted with cannon, which commanded the road.</P>
<P>The inhabitants eagerly wi&s;hed to be attacked in this place, hoping to &s;ee your troops &s;ink under the at|tempt. Their hopes were founded on the nature of the road, which would have pro|duced new difficulties. They knew it was out of the reach of the cannon of the &s;hips; and they were not afraid of being attacked in other places, being covered by the river of Gallion, being &s;ecured on both &s;ides by &s;uch a prodi|gious height, and defended by &s;everal po&s;ts, which it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd article, concerning the provi&s;ions brought to us from St. Eu|&s;tatia to the Bay Mahaut, a little town &s;ituated in the bottom of the great Cul de Sac, it is the only place from whence we received any dur|ing the &s;iege, if we except &s;ome boats that came loaden to Port Louis, Petit Canal, and Moule, three towns in Grande-terre, into which &s;ome prizes were brought. We had our magazines at the Bay Mahaut, and until that town was reduced, our communi|cation of provi&s;ions was not interrupted. They were at fir&s;t conveyed to different plantations, particularly to that of Mr. Machicourt at Arnonville, and from thence to the reduit and general quarters: but your de&s;cent at Houelbourg, which was fol|lowed by the reduction of all the po&s;ts from the Bay Ma|haut to Cape&s;terre, and the &s;eizure of all our provi&s;ions found in that town, and other places which were burned, from which places we could not po&s;&s;ibly tran&s;port them in time to our reduits and general quarters; reduced the inhabitants to the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of capitulating; be|ing in want of provi&s;ions at the general quarters as well as in other po&s;ts, particularly at the reduit, to which all the women, children, and &s;ick had retired; and, in fine, without any hope of receiving a &s;upply, having no longer any communication with the town of the Bay Mahaut, which was moreover the only pa&s;s for our militia from Gua|daloupe to Grand-terre that remained, after the reduction of Fort Louis; which pa&s;s had never been interrupted by any crui&s;ers, until you de|prived us of it.</P>
<P>In regard to the third ar|ticle of your letter, we can a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, that when the marquis of Beauharnois, general of Martinique, arrived at Grande-terre, in the &s;qua|dron of Mr. de Bompart, a few days after the capitula|tion of Guadaloupe, he di&s;|embarked about &s;ix hundred regulars, and a con&s;iderable number of men draughted from the companies in Mar|tinique, together with the volunteers, of whom, as we are a&s;&s;ured, there were fifteen hundred aboard the &s;hips that compo&s;ed the &s;quadron, where was likewi&s;e &s;tore of ammu|nition &s;uitable to the &s;ervice; but under&s;tanding that Gua|daloupe had capitulated, they reimbarked. Tho&s;e were very ill informed who &s;aid there were &s;ix hundred armed ne|groes: there were none bu &s;ervants who attended their ma&s;ters, and tho&s;e not at al intended for fighting. We &s;hall not &s;ay any thing po&s;i|tive about the return of the &s;quadron. If we refer to the general opinion, and to per|&s;ons particularly acquainted with the &s;ituation of the i&s;lands, and with the &s;eas by which they are &s;urrounded, it cannot be denied but that if Guadaloupe had not been obliged to capitulate, by your la&s;t operations, in cutting off our provi&s;ions as well by &s;ea as by land, that &s;quadron might have burned all the tran&s;ports, before the Briti&s;h &s;quadron off Dominique could have come up, as the French was more than ten leagues to windward, and you had then but one frigate of forty gun$ with your tran&s;ports; and that manoeuvre of our &s;qua|dron would have infallibly obliged you to rai&s;e the &s;iege had it not been for the pre+caution you had previou&s;ly taken.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fourtl article concerning the Fli+bu&s;tiers, certain it is, there were about five hundred in the i&s;land. Near two hun|dred of the&s;e people had di&s;|embarked at Bay Mahaut, during the &s;iege. Part of them were employed at the batteries: the re&s;t were form|ed into two companies. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of about two hundred and fifty, was commanded by Grand Jo&s;eph, who was killed at their head when your grena|diers advanced to the attack of the Batterie la Mutine: the other, of fifty, was com|manded by the &s;ieur Roux.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is the undi&s;|gui&s;ed truth of all you de&s;ired us to explain.</P>
<P>We have the honour to be, with the mo&s;t profound re|&s;pect,</P>

<P>In the &s;econd, by another letter of the 17th of May, wrote to him al&s;o, it appears what orders the general had given to governor Crump:</P>

<P>The troops which were landed did not exceed &s;ix hundred blacks and whites, and the&s;e in a wretched con|dition; &s;o that, if they had &s;tayed, they might all have been taken pri&s;oners, as Mr. Moore would have gone up and landed his marines on the back of Mr. Beauharnois, who would have found him|&s;elf between two fires.

<P>I might add a third, which is, that the i&s;land had been &s;ummoned about &s;ix weeks before by the &s;hipping; but the an&s;wer given by the go|vernor was very far from be|ing &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>Art. 11. It appears from a letter wrote by Mr. Des Hayes to general Barrington, that the &s;uccours landed by Mr. de Beauharnois con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix hundred regular troops, and a great number of the militia draughted from the companies at Martinique, be|&s;ides voluntiers, of which there were on board the fleet near fifteen hundred. This does not &s;eem like the account given of them by Mr Moore; neither is it to be in agined that the general of Martin que would tru&s;t him&s;elf with &s;uch wretches as they are repre|&s;ented, who&s;e condit on could not $ve been re$de ed $word$ mi&s;erable from the leng h of their voyage</P>
