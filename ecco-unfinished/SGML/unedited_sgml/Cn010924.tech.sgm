<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF Heaven &s;hall be plea&s;ed to open your Ears to the Humble
and Sincere Application made to you in the&s;e Sheets in behalf
of this mi&s;erably Divided Nation; your Lord&s;hips will let it be
no Ob&s;truction to the Benefit you may receive from it, that
it comes from an Unknown or Inferiour Hand.</P>
<P>Let the Author be who he will, or what he will, your Lord&s;hips
will be obliged to allow him to be a Friend to your Per&s;ons, to
Truth, and to the Intere&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ince no Man can be a Friend
to either, that does not to his utmo&s;t pur&s;ue the great End propo&s;ed
here, which is the publick Good and Peace of this Countrey.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
This Paper is Addre&s;s'd to your Lord&s;hips in your Double Capa|city,
1. As Noblemen of <HI>Scotland.</HI> 2. As Peers of <HI>Britain&punc;</HI> As the
fir&s;t, 'tis pre&s;umed you are all In&s;pired with Compa&s;&s;ion for your
Native Countrey, with Zeal for her Intere&s;t, with Concern for her
Misfortunes, and with &s;incere affectionate De&s;ires for her Recove|ry.</P>
<P>As Peers of <HI>Britain,</HI> you are Embark'd in the general Good of the
United Kingdom, you have her whole Politick Con&s;titution and
Capacity upon your Heads, are equally Patriots for one Part as for the
other.</P>
<P>It is no matter who were for, or again&s;t the Union, that comes
not in Con&s;ideration now, whoever was again&s;t it, or whoever was
for it; you are all now equally concerned to keep it Sacred, and to
make it an Advantage, which, without yoar Lord&s;hips Concurrence
can never be done.</P>
<P>It would be a Charge too heavy, and what the&s;e Sheets &s;hall not
&s;o much as &s;ugge&s;t of &s;uch Honourable Per&s;ons as your Lord&s;hips,
tha$ any of your Body &s;hould retain &s;uch Aver&s;ions to the Union, as to
endeavour to make it produce all the Evils they formerly predicted of
it.</P>
<P>Time, My Lords, and Gods Providence has already concurred to
make the Union a mean of Deliverance to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and it is very
remarkable that God has brought this Nation to a kind of a Nece&s;&s;ity
of giving Him publick Thanks for the UNION; the Thank&s;giving
on the third of <HI>June</HI> being in its Nature no le&s;s, as it was a Thank&s;|giving
for a Mercy received by the Agency of that Nation you are
United to, and Effected as a Con&s;equence of the Union, by virtue
of which only <HI>England</HI> became obliged at their own Expence to re&s;cue
you out of the Hands of Popery and Tyranny, from which it is
manife&s;t <HI>Scotland</HI> could by no means have Delivered her &s;elf.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that &s;ay this Merits no Thanks either to <HI>England,</HI> or to the
Union, and renounce the Obligation or Sen&s;e of Kindne&s;s, becau&s;e
<HI>England,</HI> had been obliged to do it for her own <HI>Safety,</HI> &s;eem like the
Ungratful Wretch, that when his Hou&s;e was on Fire, would give no
Thanks to his Neighbour that put it out, becau&s;e his own Intere&s;t
obliged him to do it, to &s;ave his own Hou&s;e which was next.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
It is out of Doubt that the Care and Concern <HI>England</HI> &s;hew'd for
the Danger of <HI>Scotland</HI> on this Occa&s;ion was an Effect of the Union,
and therefore your Thank&s;giving for the &s;ea&s;onable Deliverance you
received is in one Sence, a giving Thanks for the Union&mdash;; And
may Heaven go on to give this Nation con&s;tant Occa&s;ion to give Him
Prai&s;e for the Effects of the Union, till in meer Sen&s;e of their own
Intere&s;t they are entirely Reconciled to it as the only Mean, under
God, of the Nations Safety and Pro&s;perity&mdash;. But this by the
way.</P>
<P>But in order to bring the De&s;ign of this Paper down to your
Lord&s;hips immediate Contemplation, your Lord&s;hips are mo&s;t humbly
intreated to look a little into, and con&s;ider the pre&s;ent State of your
Native Countrey, and perhaps by this your Lord&s;hips may be helped
to &s;ee how much it is in your Lord&s;hips Power, and mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity
be your undoubted Duty to promote its Settlement and Pro&s;peri|ty.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland,</HI> My Lords, Promi&s;ed her &s;elf, and many of your Lord|&s;hips
in your Thoughts Promi&s;ed your &s;elves for her a great many
Advantages from the Union; It would be an unplea&s;ant Contem|plation
to offer to your Lord&s;hips, that the Di&s;appointment of all the
good Things <HI>Scotland</HI> might Expect from the Union &s;hould ly at the
Door of her Nobility, the Sons of her Triumph, which are her
Boa&s;t and her Glory, &s;ome of whom were the very Means of making
this very Union, and without whom it had never been brought to
Perfection.</P>
<P>And yet &s;o it is, and &s;o it will appear to be, unle&s;s your Lord&s;hips
&s;hall in time Con&s;ider the State of your Countrey, li&s;ten to its Groans,
hear the Voice of its Circum&s;tances, and immediately Apply your
&s;elves to the proper Remedies.</P>
<P>We were told indeed one thing again&s;t the Union, which it is but
too apparent proves True, tho' differently from the Thoughts of tho&s;e
that Sugge&s;ted it, <HI>viz.</HI> That we &s;hould be In&s;ected with the Contagion
of <HI>Englands Vices,</HI> and &s;o if we &s;hould partake of her Wealth, we &s;hould
al&s;o partake of her Crimes.</P>
<P>Thus far this is come to pa&s;s, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Grief of all good
Men, that we have been and are affected with the Contagion of
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<HI>Englands</HI> Divi&s;ions, the Poy&s;on of Partie Strife is already &s;pread from
thence upon us; and if your Lord&s;hips do not apply your &s;elves to an
immediat cure for this Mallady, the Lepro&s;ie of B$ibery and Corrupti|on
will get into the Walls of the Building, and will never be cured
till the very Hou&s;e (I mean the Con&s;titution) be pull'd down to the
very Foundation.</P>
<P>To explain this, it is nece&s;&s;ary to enter a little into the Cau&s;es and
Nature of our pre&s;ent Politicks, and &s;ee if the evil Spirit that is gone
out among us, be not a Spirit of De&s;truction, and that aims at all &s;orts
of National Confu&s;ions.</P>
<P>From whence come Strife and Divi&s;ions among you, <HI>&s;ays the Text,</HI>
come they not from your Lu&s;ts? Lu&s;t of Rule, Lu&s;t of Ambition, Pride
and Covetou&s;ne&s;s; are not the&s;e the Ground of our fatal Divi&s;ions;
and how unhappy is it to &s;ee this Strife nowhere &s;o fixt, as among our
Nooles, who are the Guardians of our Peace, and &s;hould be the Di&s;|couragers
of all our Divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is in vain to flatter your Lord&s;hips Characters, and pay Homage to
your Titles; but to &s;peak plain, is to &s;peak hone&s;tly, if the&s;e wretch|ed
Divi&s;ions begin among the Nobility, and from thence &s;pread over
this Nation, the Nobility then will have the Fame, (if &s;uch it can be
counted,) of being their Countrys de&s;troyers.</P>
<P>For GOD's &s;ake then my Lords, and for your Countrys &s;ake, for
the &s;ake of your Families, your Religion and your Po&s;terity be plea&s;|ed
but to look into the pre&s;ent State of the Divi&s;ions of your Countrey,
and when you do this Impartially; if you do not &s;ee, that you alone
are the Cau&s;e of all this Di&s;traction, you will at lea&s;t &s;ee, that it is in
your Power alone to cure it: And how your Lord&s;hips will an&s;wer it
to your Honour, to your Con&s;ciences, to your Sons, and to your
MAKER; That having it in your Power to &s;ave your Countrey from
the&s;e mi&s;erable Confu&s;ions you neglected it, is enough to make you
tremble to think on.</P>
<P>Among the Illu&s;trious Appearance that are now to a&s;&s;em|ble,
a great many are come from <HI>England;</HI> what Spirit they carried
up, and what they bring down, is very melancholly to reflect on;
They went up united, they come down divided; They went up with
Zeal and Love to their Countrey which they had united, they come
<PB N="7" REF="6">
down po&s;&s;e&s;t with Party. D&mdash;'Is that was again&s;t their Countrys
Peace; They went up uniting this Kingdom with its Neighbours, they
come down dividing it again&s;t it &s;elf&mdash;: What my Lords has <HI>England</HI>
done to you, or what have you done to one another? Where is the
Spirit and the Zeal with which the Union was carried on here amids the
Clamours of your Common Enemy? And what Condition &s;hall this
Countrey be in to defend it &s;elf again&s;t the Powerful Enemies of the
Union both at Home and Abroad, if our Nobility who were the Life
and Soul of the Union for&s;ake the very fir&s;t Principle of Union in Ge|neral,
<HI>viz.</HI> to unite one with another.</P>
<P>When your Lord&s;hips were fixing and fini&s;hing the great Affair of
the Union, what noble Speeches came from your Mouths! And well
we hoped, my Lords, they came from your Hearts, encouraging Uni|on,
per&s;wading the People to imbrace Union, applauding Union it
&s;elf as a Vertue, and the Union of <HI>Britain</HI> as an Honour and Advan|tage:
Is it po&s;&s;ible the &s;ame Age that &s;aw your Lord&s;hips &s;o Zealous
for Union, &s;hould &s;ee the &s;ame Noble Advocats of Peace divided into
formidable Squadrons, fighting with the wor&s;t &s;ort of Weapons again&s;t
their Country? For all &s;orts of Divi&s;ions among your Lord&s;hips, are
Wars rai&s;ed again&s;t your Countreys Good.</P>
<P>And how weak are the Pretences of this Party-Struggle, and what
is aim'd at in the Strife? The Good of our Countrey, as it is the
&s;pecious Pretence of all publick Actions, &s;o is it here: But will your
Lord&s;hips be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, The publick Good is always to be
pur&s;ued by proper and &s;uitable Methods. Peace is attained be&s;t in
peaceable Methods. <HI>Pax quaeritur Bello</HI> is a Motto fit for Men in Arms;
but in Councils, in Government, in Parliaments, it is the Men of
Peace only, and Methods of Peace that can produce Peace. Where
there is Strife and Contention, there is every evil Work: And it is
impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch Confu&s;ions of Intere&s;ts, and Jarring of Parties as is now
&s;een among us, can procure Peace, or be for the Countreys
Good.</P>
<P>If it were &s;ufficient to &s;ay we aim'd at the publick Good, then all
Actions would be &s;anctified by that Cover: Even the <HI>French</HI> Inva&s;ion,
my Lords, was &s;o for the publick Good; and the wor&s;t Baits the De|vil
<PB N="8" REF="7">
lays to in$nare Men and Nations, are gilded over with that glitter|ing
Shew.</P>
<P>But, my Lords, will your Lord&s;hips be plea&s;ed to li&s;ten to a yet &s;upe|rior
In&s;tructor, who&s;e Words have hitherto been Oracles to this
whole I&s;land: When Her Maje&s;ty pa&s;s'd the Bill for an Union of
the two Kingdoms, you have Her Royal In&s;tructions to all Her
loving Subjects, to Unite with one another, as the only Bond of
Peace, and as the only Safety and Happine&s;s of the Na|tion.</P>
<P>But from general Exhortations to Peace, your Lord&s;hips are in|treated
to look into the &s;candalous Trifles which are the Subject of the
pre&s;ent Divi&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> Who &s;hall or &s;hall not be &s;ent up to &s;erve their
Countrey in Parliament. And, in this Ca&s;e, my Lords, it is mo&s;t ju&s;t
to call it Scandalous and a Trifle.</P>
<P>Not that it is a Trifle, the &s;ending Good, and Wi&s;e, and Hone&s;t
Members to Parliament; But, my Lords, it is but a Trifle of Diffe|rence,
which Party tho&s;e Good, Wi&s;e and Hone&s;t Men &s;hall be cho&s;en
out of; e&s;pecially if we compare the Thing with the terrible Divi&s;i|on
it is now &s;etting on Foot in this Nation.</P>
<P>And as for being Scandalous, ti's hoped your Lord&s;hips will pardon
the Cour&s;ene&s;s of the Term, &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible to give it any other
that would be appo&s;ite and &s;uited to the thing, while it gives but too
ju&s;t Ground to the People to &s;ugge&s;t. That there mu&s;t be &s;ome other
End, than the mee$ Serving <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the eager De&s;ire which ap|pears
in &s;ome Gentlemen, to be cho&s;en for her Repre&s;entatives. It is a
mo&s;t undoubted Truth, and your Lord&s;hips will bear with the Plain|ne&s;s
of Laying it down.</P>
<P>That whoever he is, that &s;eeks or endeavours to be Elected a Mem|ber
of Parliament, whether Peer or Commoner, for any other Rea|&s;on,
or with any other De&s;ign, than the Service and Good of his
Countrey, &s;o far betrays his Countrey, and the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him
by his Countrey.</P>
<P>It is a mo&s;t &s;candalous Reflection upon the Honour and Character of
your Lord&s;hips, and all the Repre&s;entative Body of <HI>Scotland,</HI> let them
be of what Squadron they will, That it &s;hould be &s;ugge&s;ted, any Men,
or Party of Men among your Illu&s;trious Body, &s;hould have any
<PB N="9" REF="8">
private Ends to &s;eek in the hone&s;t Pur&s;uit now made, of being
Elected.</P>
<P>It cannot but be your Lord&s;hips Concern, therefore, to &s;hew your
Re&s;entment at &s;uch ill Treatment, and at its Authors: But above all,
to clear your Conduct from &s;o much as the Shadow of &s;uch a Crime&mdash;,
Not, my Lords, that it is a Crime to &s;erve your Prince, but 'tis a
Crime of the wor&s;t <HI>Nature,</HI> to &s;eek to obtain what &s;hould be only the
Reward of your Merit and Capacities, from a certain formidable Ap|pearance,
made by Strength of Party, not Merit; as if this or that
Party had &s;uch or &s;uch a &s;uperior Influence on their Countrey, and
therefore the Men mu&s;t be imploy'd, le&s;t they &s;hould <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>My Lords, this Paper forbears to enter into the unhappy <HI>Et Cetera</HI>'s
of this Argument, le&s;t the Nakedne&s;s of &s;ome Mens Conduct &s;hould
appear; which, in Hopes of their Amendment, and in Concern for
their Reputation, are concealed.</P>
<P>If, my Lords, there are &s;uch pernicious Politicks now on Foot a|mong
you, and Men are forming them&s;elves into Parties, in Affairs
of this Moment, in order to get them&s;elves into, or to keep them|&s;elves
in Preferment, Imployments and Tru&s;ts in the publick Ad|mini&s;tration;
'Tis a &s;ad Token of their wanting Principles to <HI>di&s;charge
tho&s;e Imployments,</HI> when they &s;o far mortgage their Principles to obtain
them.</P>
<P>For what Coherence, my Lords, have Places and Preferments,
Pen&s;ions and Salaries under the Crown, or Advancement at Court,
with Repre&s;enting your Countrey in Parliament? It is true, we have
a Court and a Queen that will not bribe her Subjects, to betray their Coun|trey,
nor &s;uffer them to do it when they would; but it has not always
been &s;o, nor may it ever be &s;o, and therefore it has been a long Struggle
in the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> to render Employment from the Court
and Repre&s;entatives in Parliament, incon&s;i&s;tent with one another&mdash;.
But <HI>be that as it will,</HI> this is certain, tho they may have an hone&s;t Cohe|rence
with one another, they can have no hone&s;t Dependance upon
one another. And therefore it is a mo&s;t un&s;ufferable Slander on your
Lord&s;hips, to &s;ay that this Struggle is with any De&s;ign of &s;erving your
&s;elves, or of recommending this or that Party <HI>to the Government,</HI> as of
Superior Intere&s;t in <HI>Scotland;</HI> if this were your De&s;ign, it would brand
<PB N="10" REF="9">
your Lord&s;hips Characters and Families with a Crime too infamous to
name, nay it wold reproach the Queen her &s;elf and her Admini&s;trati|on,
as if her Maje&s;ty would be aw'd to be&s;tow her Favours, or commit
her Tru&s;t to ANY PARTY that appears formidable enough to carry the
Election among the Peers.</P>
<P>Far be it from the De&s;ign of this Paper to &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch a thing of &s;o
Honourable, &s;o Illu&s;trious a Body as the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it cannot
be, that a Thought &s;o mean either of her Maje&s;ty or of her Admini|&s;tration,
can enter into your Hearts, and if it &s;hould, you may be told
without any Indecency, and much more without pretending to prophe|cie
that your Lord&s;hips will be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty has all along &s;hewed in the placing and di&s;placing Men
and Partys &s;uch a &s;teadine&s;s of Re&s;olution, and &s;uch a clearne&s;s of Judg|ment,
that it is not to be feared on one hand, or hoped on the other,
that appearance of Faces only &s;hall be a Key to her Favours, or Num|bers
of Names, and Strength of Party open or &s;hut the Door to the Pow|er
of Admini&s;tration: And therefore any Man who&s;e Eyes are in his
head, may acquaint your Lord&s;hips that this is not the way to obtain
that End.</P>
<P>But my Lords, it cannot be un&s;ea&s;onable to remind your Lord&s;hips
how publickly &s;uch Slanders are rai&s;ed, how indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread, and
how openly your Lord&s;hips Honour is in&s;ulted with &s;uch things as the&s;e,
as if the gaining Places and Imployments at Court were the only thing,
aimed at, and it mu&s;t be whol&s;om Advice to your Lord&s;hips, let it
come from never &s;o mean a hand, that your Lord&s;hips would be plea&s;|ed
&s;o to guard your Conduct, as to give no room for &s;uch vile Sugge&s;ti|ons,
that Po&s;terity may know the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> are not capable of
any thing &s;o low, &s;o mean, &s;o much under their Dignity and Chara|cter
in the World.</P>
<P>My Lords, the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> never wanted Merit to recom|mend
them to their Princes Service, and to advance them both at
Home&punc; and Abroad; and to form Parties to obtain Places at the Price
of the dividing and &s;ubdividing their Countrey, is a thing &s;o mean,
that it fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;es they wanted Merit otherways to recommend them,
or that their Sovereign di&s;pen&s;ed her Favours by appeareance, and un|der
the Aw of Parties, and not by the light of her Judgment, and the
Merit of the Per&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
It is no hard matter my Lords to propo&s;e a general Unity and Con|cord
in this great Matter now before your Lord&s;hips, as the only way
to pre&s;erve your Lord&s;hips and your Countrey from Ruine; but it is
harder to propo&s;e a particular Method how to cru&s;h this Mon&s;ter,
this Infant Hydra, this wicked Spirit of Party-making ju&s;t now crept
into this Kingdom&mdash;. It is called a Spirit now crept in; not that
the World is ignorant of your former Divi&s;ions which in their Degree
have been pernitious enough, but the pre&s;ent Flood of ill Practices
which is broke in upon the Nations Peace, is but new, and may re|ceive
a Check from your Lord&s;hips, if it be taken now before the
Breach, at which it comes in, grows too wide to be made up.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign however of this Addre&s;s is not to croud your Thoughts
with Schemes of Elections, and form uniting Projects among your Lord|&s;hips,
if your Eyes were open to the dangerous Con&s;equence of the
pre&s;ent Divi&s;ions, you would always apply your &s;elves to the proper re|medies,
without any bodies Advice. Could you but &s;ee how this Me|thod
a&s;&s;ures you of the certainty of their planting eternal Feuds and
Animo&s;ities among you as a Nation, and among your Families as No|blemen
or Gentlemen, ever rivalling, ever undermining one another,
could you be made &s;en&s;ible of the Con&s;equences of the&s;e things to
your Children and to the Government, how by &s;trength of Parties &s;ome
of the Nobility may for ever be excluded from the Honour of &s;itting in
Parliament, a Priviledge born with them, and which they may have
done nothing to forefeit; how this will rouze the retired Families of the
Nobility, and make them ever be pu&s;hing at, and forming Parties for
Elections, and how it will entail Family Grudge, per&s;onal Peike, and
Party-quarrels on our Po&s;terity, handing down Mi&s;chief, and convey|ing
rancour'd Blood from Generation to Generation, when your Lord|&s;hips
Eyes are open to the&s;e things, and you &s;hall come but to give your
&s;elves lei&s;ure to con&s;ider them, your Lord&s;hips might be left to find out
the ea&s;y Remedy for &s;uch fatal Mi&s;chiefs, you could not but apply
your &s;elves to it, for they are really Mines filled with all manner of
Combu&s;tibles, $u&s;t ready to be &s;prung, and to blow up the very Foun|dation
of this Nations Felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
And now my Lords, not to enter upon Methods of Election, or al|tering
the Scheme directed by Parliament, yet 'tis humbly left upon your
Lord&s;hips Thoughts to con&s;ider of as a Medium to pre&s;erve your Lord|&s;hips
and your Po&s;terity in Peace and Amity among your &s;elves, and
prevent the mortal Contagion of Party-&s;trife &s;preading it &s;elf over this
Nation, to the Ruine of your Honour, your Peace, and your Po&s;terity,
whether this Election might not be carried on without the Breach a|mong
your Lord&s;hips, which all Wi&s;e Men fore&s;ee, and all Good
Men are grieved for.</P>
<P>Ballot has been thought of as a Medium to prevent the particular
Peikes and Feuds, which from the various Sidings of Families and Inte|re&s;ts
may be too frequent among the Nobility, &s;ince in the Balloting
it cannot be known (other than Men will di&s;cover them&s;elves) who any
Man gives his Vote for: But then again this will not at all put a &s;top
to the Sollicitations and Struggle of Parties among us, which is the
Root of all the other Mi&s;chiefs, and will be always a teeming Brooder
of unfore&s;een Evils among us.</P>
<P>Rotation has been rejected in Parliament, and as it would be a Me|thod
to which your Lord&s;hips would be tied down by Law, and from
which you could upon no Con&s;ideration whatever recede, it is not
without its Inconveniences, and is not altogether con&s;i&s;tent with the
Nature of a Free Repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>But might it not be worth your Lord&s;hips while to con&s;ider, whe|ther
&s;uch a thing as a voluntar Rotation might not be form'd by Con|&s;ent,
and in time obtain by Cu&s;tom, &s;o as to be the receiv'd Method
of Elections, re&s;erving &s;till the Right of breaking in upon it, tho not
to practi&s;e it but in extraordinary Ca&s;es&mdash;. This my Lords is a
&s;ort propo&s;al, but it is full of various Advantages to your Countrey, to
the Nobility as a Body, and to the particular Families of the Nobility
as Peers, and it will be very difficult to find out one Inconvenience
that can be charged upon it, Nor can any thing be objected again&s;t
it, but that perhaps your Lord&s;hips will &s;ay the Propo&s;al comes <HI>too
late,</HI> and it is otherways determined.</P>
<P>1. My Lords, by this method all the Nobility in <HI>Scotland</HI> who
are legally qualified, will, <HI>or may if they plea&s;e,</HI> enjoy their Right
<PB N="13" REF="12">
of &s;itting in Parliament, and &s;o the Union not be reproacht with
taking away their Birth-right.</P>
<P>2. Your Lord&s;hips will be made Judges among your &s;elves of
per&s;onal Merit, and may reject any Nobleman who has rendred
him&s;elf unworthy of the Honour of repre&s;enting you; and tho
upon none but extraordinary Occa&s;ions, &s;uch Di&s;tinctions will
be made, yet your Lord&s;hips would be Judges of the&s;e Extraordi|nary
Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>3.This unhappy Party-&s;truggle among you would immediatly
die, and be forgotten, you would have no more Squadrons of
Parties formed again&s;t one another, labouring to engro&s;s the
Votes of their Inferiors, to purcha&s;e the Smiles of their Superi|or,
all the Bribery and Corruption, which if it be not yet come
in, will of cour&s;e follow the&s;e Proceedings, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be left
off; all the Fury of Parties will die, the Fire of Contention go
out, and the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> will be delivered from a new In|fection;
which if it be once &s;pread among them, will in time de|bauch
their Principles, and render their Per&s;ons contemptible.</P>
<P>The World, my Lords, is not without Examples of this kind; and
tho many might be produced, yet two are &s;o Eminent, and &s;o near
your Lord&s;hips, that they will be mo&s;t familiar to your Thoughts.</P>
<P>The Parliaments of <HI>England,</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of <HI>Britain</HI> now, (by
Con&s;equence of the Union) have an undoubted Right to limit the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion,
and tran&s;po&s;e the Right of A&s;cending to the Throne of this
I&s;land; and this being e&s;tabli&s;hed in both Kingdoms in their &s;eparate
State by particular Declarations, be&s;ides Precedents, it may pa&s;s for a
Maxim here, without requiring further Confirmation.</P>
<P>Now, tho the &s;everal Qualifications which the Law requires, may
incapacitat any per&s;on to govern, who otherways had the Right of
primogeniture&punc; as in the Ca&s;e of the Abdication of the late King and the
de&s;cending to his Children being both &s;u&s;pected, and al&s;o Popi&s;h; and tho'
the Parliament have an ab&s;olute power to declare and determine this or
that per&s;on to be Succe&s;&s;or or Heir apparent; yet when Circum&s;tances
have put them off from one Branch or another, they have always kept
the Line in view, and &s;till re&s;erving the Right of naming the Succe&s;|&s;or,
<PB N="14" REF="13">
they have always gone to the next in Blood, again&s;t whom no le|gal
Exception has lyen.</P>
<P>A &s;econd In&s;tance is in the Election of the Lord Mayor of the City
of <HI>London,</HI> which is thus, the Common Hall, <HI>that is,</HI> the Suffrages of
all the Livery-men or Burge&s;&s;es of the City, is required to choo&s;e two
Men out of the Court of Aldermen to be Lord Mayor; the&s;e when by
the Majority of the Electors they are cho&s;en, are returned to the Court
of Aldermen.</P>
<P>The Court of Aldermen is obliged to name one of the&s;e two as Lord
Mayor for the Year en&s;uing, it is ab&s;olutely in the Brea&s;t of the Alder|men
to take which of the two they plea&s;e; and &s;ometimes as they &s;ee
occa&s;ion, they do break into their Cu&s;tom, and choo&s;e out of their
u&s;ual Method, but generally &s;peaking, and unle&s;s &s;ome extraordinary
Ca&s;e interveen, they choo&s;e the Senior Alderman, or as they call it, he
that is next the Chair.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e examples its pre&s;umed are exactly to the Ca&s;e&mdash;, and
prove that the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> may in this Election ob&s;erve a volun|tary
Rotation, and take their whole Body in its Cour&s;e, either begin|ning
at the Elde&s;t or Highe&s;t, down to the Younge&s;t or Lowe&s;t of the
Nobility, or one of the Highe&s;t, one of the lowe&s;t; and yet ly under no
other Obligation to confine them&s;elves to it than the Court of Alder|men
do in choo&s;ing the per&s;on next the Chair.</P>
<P>If any Nobleman by rea&s;on of his Circum&s;tances, either of Health or
E&s;tate, found it not for his Convenience, his Ab&s;ence from the A&s;&s;em|bly
might determine it, &s;ince it were ea&s;y to re&s;olve to choo&s;e none
but &s;uch as were pre&s;ent, or &s;uch as &s;ent their Names, de&s;iring to be
e&s;teemed as pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>O how would this at one Blow overwhelm all the Schemes and Pro|jects
of the pre&s;ent Squadrons of Separation! how would it remove all
the ill Blood the Poi&s;on and Rancor that is breaking in upon Families.
How would it e&s;tabli&s;h the Peace and Tranquillity of the Nobility of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> which by the other unhappy Divi&s;ions now on foot is like to
be perfectly de&s;troyed and trampled under foot, even by its own Mem|bers.
<HI>But alas!</HI> We are told already 'tis too late, <HI>the War is begun,</HI> and
no &s;uch Capitulation (<HI>the wor&s;e for Scotland &s;till</HI>) can be hearkened
to.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
There is another Method, but what hopes is there to &s;ee it put in
practice! and what a happy, Nation would we be, if it could be
brought to pa&s;s! And this is that laying a&s;ide Parties and privat De&s;igns!
the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> would act like them&s;elves, and make their Ele|ction
intirely free from any remote View of Intere&s;t or Prejudices, and
choo&s;ing Men of Capacity and Merit, as well as Nobility of Birth, &s;eek
to rai&s;e and maintain the Reputation of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the Hou&s;e of Peers,
rather than the Reputation of Party, in the hopes of a &s;hare in the Spoils
of the Nation.</P>
<P>This would bring the Members of <HI>Scotland</HI> in either Hou&s;e into a Fi|gure
&s;uited to the Tru&s;t their Countrey has repo&s;ed in them, <HI>and this it is
not too late to do.</HI> But my Lords, when all is carried by Intere&s;t and Party,
Club and Cabal, when Whigs &s;et up Torries again&s;t Whigs, and Tor|ries
&s;et up Whigs again&s;t Torries, what can this be? is this a Strife for
your Nation! is this a Struggle for the publick Good! is it not a meer
Strife for Ma&s;tery, and the Heavings of two Mighty Parties, who pu&s;h
their &s;ecret De&s;igns, and have &s;omething el&s;e be&s;ides the Good of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
in their Vew?</P>
<P>And what will be the Con&s;equences of the&s;e things? GOD Almigh|ty
only knows what National Mi&s;chiefs His Goodne&s;s will prevent,
which would otherways be the Effect of &s;uch Divi&s;ion$&punc; but it
would be very &s;atisfactory to many that wi&s;h well to <HI>Scotland,</HI> $ome
body that &s;ees farther than ordinary into &s;uch things would clear up
&s;ome of the&s;e Doubts about them.</P>
<P>1 <HI>&s;t.</HI> Whether this will not in its nature tend, <HI>Not</HI> $span$ breaking
or intirely di&s;&s;olving the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> as a Body $word$ that can
hardly be po&s;&s;ible, tho the Scripture &s;ays, A Hou&s;e $word$ again&s;t
it &s;elf cannot &s;tand: But to the le&s;&s;ening their Characters, rendring them
contemptible in the Eyes of the World, and particularly of Hone&s;t
Men; as men who have abandoned all Concern for their Countrey,
are acted only by their Private Intere&s;ts, and Pur&s;ue&punc; nothing but the
Game of Preferment and Partys, and by Con&s;equence are not to
be valued, tru&s;ted, or depended upon.</P>
<P>2. Whether this will not oblige the Queen in meer Defence of her
Maje&s;ties Character <HI>as to di&s;cerning,</HI> and to let her Subjects know,
that Names, Numbers, and a &s;hew of Party-Strength, cannot aw or
<PB N="16" REF="15">
bya&s;s her Judgment in the Choice of her Servants, to contemn all
Parties that &s;o openly pur&s;ue &s;uch a Game, under Colour of the Ser|vice
of their Countrey, &amp; re&s;olve to imploy NONE of them, be their
fancied Succe&s;s never &s;o great, except &s;uch as their per&s;onal Merit
and different Conduct &s;hall recommend: And if her Maje&s;ty has ta|ken
up &s;uch Re&s;olutions already, whether all the World does not ju|&s;tifie
her Royal Prudence in it, and applaud both her Maje&s;ties Wi&s;|dom
and Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>3. Whether the Animo&s;ities this Party-Struggle lays the Foundati|on
of, and which it is, apparent will be at lea&s;t triennally renewed,
do not weaken <HI>Scotland</HI> in particular, lay her open to Foreign Ene|mies,
di&s;able her People in the general Defence of the Government,
and may not in time be run up to &s;uch a height as may be dangerous
to the publick Peace&mdash;; and thus &s;he &s;hall be rendered contemp|tible
on one hand, and &s;u&s;pected on the other, and be con&s;tantly
$$bjected to the in&s;ult of a Foreign Enemie, that would gladly over|$$he&s;m
both Parties.</P>
<P>Thus my Lords, not the Ruine of your own Characters, the bla&s;ting
the Honour of the Nobility of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and rendring even the Repre|&s;entatives
$ou &s;hall choo&s;e contemptible in the Eyes of the World; not
