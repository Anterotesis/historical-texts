<HEAD>PROLOGUE. <HI>Spoken by</HI> Mr. FOOTE.</HEAD>
<L>FOR wit's keen &s;atire, and this laughing &s;tage,</L>
<L>What theme &s;o fruitful as a Bankrupt Age?</L>
<L>For not confin'd to commerce is the cur&s;e,</L>
<L>The head is near as empty as the pur&s;e;</L>
<L>Equally &s;unk, our credit and our wit,</L>
<L>Nor is the &s;age mere &s;olvent than the cit;</L>
<L>All the&s;e&mdash;but &s;oft, ere thus abroad we roam,</L>
<L>Were it not prudent fir&s;t to look at home?</L>
<L>You, gentle Sirs, have giv'n me credit long,</L>
<L>And took my word for many an idle &s;ong;</L>
<L>But if exhau&s;ted, I give notes to-day,&mdash;</L>
<L>For wit and humour, which I cannot pay,</L>
<L>I mu&s;t turn Bankrupt too, and hop away.</L>
<L>Unle&s;s indeed, I modi&s;hly apply,</L>
<L>For leave to &s;ell my works by lottery.</L>
<L>Tho' few will favour, where's no ca&s;h to fee'em,</L>
<L>Poor hopes, that way to part with my Mu&s;cum:</L>
<L>My old friend, Smirk, indeed, may lend his aid,</L>
<L>And &s;ell by auction all my &s;tock in trade;</L>
<L>His placid features, and imploring eye,</L>
<L>May tempt perhaps the tardy town to buy;</L>
<L>His winning manner, and his &s;oft addre&s;s,</L>
<L>To other &s;ales of mine have giv'n &s;ucce&s;s;</L>
<L>But after all, my ever honour'd friends,</L>
<L>On you alone my fate this night depends;</L>
<L>I've fought &s;ome battles, gain'd &s;ome vict'rys here,</L>
<L>And little thought a culpript to appear</L>
<L>Before this hou&s;e; but if re&s;olv'd you go</L>
<L>To find me guilty, or to make me &s;o,</L>
<L>To grant me neither wit, nor ta&s;te, nor &s;en&s;e,</L>
<L>Vain were my plea, and u&s;ele&s;s my defence.</L>
<L>But &s;till, I will not &s;teal, I will not beg,</L>
<L>Tho' I've a pa&s;&s;$ort in this wooden leg.</L>
<L>But to my cot contentedly retire,</L>
<L>And flew my cabbage by my only fire;</L>
<L>Mean time, great Sirs, my &s;entence yet unknown,</L>
<L>E'en as your Ju&s;tice be your candor &s;hewn,</L>
<L>And when you touch my honour, don't forget your own.</L>

<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>THIS letter and ca&s;ket, with my ma&s;ter's mo&s;t re&s;pectful compliments, you will, Kitty, with your own fair hands, deliver to Mi&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Ca&s;ket is heavy&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e, Mr. Robin, this is what my Lady calls the Purryfunalia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>A &s;mall tribute, Madam, to adorn the bride on the happy occa&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, I &s;uppo&s;e you look upon this mar|riage as good as concluded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Things are gone &s;uch a length, that not the lea&s;t doubt can be made.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet between the cup and the lip,&mdash;you remember the proverb?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of the parties may die to be &s;ure, other|wi&s;e I don't know how&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: The young lady has not alter'd her mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No to my knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Sir Robert Ri&s;counter, her father? the&s;e curmudgeonly cits regard no ties, no obli|gations when they have an higher intere&s;t in view. I &s;uppo&s;e he has received larger propo&s;als from &s;ome other party.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard no &s;uch thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I am &s;ure no impediment can ari&s;e from our quarter. My ma&s;ter, Sir James Bid|dulph,
<PB N="3" REF="6">
is too much a man of honour: be&s;ides, I know his whole &s;oul is wrapt up in Mi&s;s Lydia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has given her pretty convincing proofs of his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, I &s;uppo&s;e the malicious mother-in-law, who, I know, hates Mi&s;s, and has a damn'd deal of art, in conjunction with Mi&s;s Lucy, that pre|cious pledge of her former hu&s;band's affections, has contrived to throw &s;ome confounded rub in the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ble&s;s me, Mr. Robin, I don't know what you mean, I am &s;ure I &s;aid nothing at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. But only that things which are not done, may perhaps never be done; there is nothing certain but death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very moral, Mi&s;s Kitty,&mdash;(there is &s;ome mi&s;|tery, if I could but get at it, but this &s;lut is as cunning&mdash;I will have a trial, however) nay, for the matter of that, I can have, Mrs. Kitty, no intere&s;t at all in this match: there is &s;o much confinement, and form, even in the mo&s;t fa&s;hion|able families, that a &s;ingle &s;ervice is be&s;t &s;uited to me, e&s;pecially too, that now I am got into mo&s;t of the clubs: there is one circum&s;tance I
<PB N="4" REF="7">
&s;hall mo&s;t feelingly regret: That I own, will greatly touch me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, what may that be, Mr. Robin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not living under the &s;ame roof with Mi&s;s Kitty. I made no doubt, Madam, but your fortunes would follow your mi&s;tre&s;s's, and, in that ca&s;e, I thought to &s;often the rigours of my captivity, in your agreeable conver&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Mr. Robin? Well, I prote&s;t, I did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when our mutual endeavours had pro|cured for us a &s;mall independence, I flatter'd my|&s;elf with gently &s;liding the down-hill of life, &s;ubject to no other will but Mi&s;s Kitty's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a difference between him, and the &s;er|vants of this &s;ide the bar?&mdash;Really, Mr. Robin, you talk nearly as well as your ma&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And no wonder, Madam, &s;ince love, the &s;ame deity, in&s;pires us both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How quick you are in your rippartees, Mr. Robin? are you good at a riddle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you mean the making them, no; it is too low a &s;pecies of writing for me; for novels I
<PB N="5" REF="8">
have now and then &s;ome dealings with Noble, and have by me a genteel comedy of one act, that is thought to have a good deal of merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And Pray when does it make its appearance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, I don't know, all the managers are &s;uch &s;cribblers, that they won't give a genius fair play, but engro&s;s the whole &s;tage to them|&s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very &s;elfi&s;h, indeed. Well, Mr. Robin, though you won't make a riddle, I will, which, as my Lady expects me, you may &s;tudy to expound by your&s;elf. This match won't take place, and yet are none of the parties to blame; I may live in the &s;ame hou&s;e with you, though I &s;hould leave my young Mi&s;tre&s;s's &s;ervice, and the lo&s;s of my place may perhaps be the making of my fortune. So Adieu.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but Mi&s;s Kitty, one word, if you plea&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a &s;yllable, go, and puzzle your brains. But take this, for your comfort, that if you can|not at pre&s;ent make out my meaning, a little time will fully explain it.<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>So &s;kitti&s;h and &s;hy, Mrs. Pert! but if our next meeting don't bring forth this &s;ecret, you are no true chambermaid, nor I fit for a valet de chambre. All re&s;erve among&s;t &s;ervants is flat

Sir Robert is choleric enough, but then, as he is provoked without cau&s;e, he is appea&s;ed without rea&s;on; one word will inflame, another extingui&s;h the fire; whom one minute he per&s;ecutes, the next he protects. His joy, grief, love, hatred, are in eternal rotation, and I have been often tempted to think his mind a machine, moved only by the immediate objects before it.</P>
