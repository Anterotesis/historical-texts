<HEAD>ENGLISH SOVEREIGNS.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE the Romans came into this i&s;land, the Britons, who then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the country, were divided into &s;everal nations, each of them governed by their own kings. And, when Britain became a mem|ber of the Roman empire, many of their tribes had their proper kings, who were &s;uffered to govern by their own laws, provided they were tributary. Such kings were Cogidunus and Pra&s;titagus, mentioned by Tacitus; Lucius, &s;aid to be the fir&s;t chri&s;tian king, who died in 407, and left the Roman emperor heir to his kingdom; with Coilus, the father of Helena, mother of Con&s;tantine the Great. After the Romans had quitted Britain, upon the irruptions of the Goths into Italy, in the empire of Honorius, that is, in 430, the kingly government returned to the Britons, who cho&s;e for their king, Con&s;tantine, brother of Aldroi|nus, king of Brittany, in France, a prince of the Briti&s;h blood; to whom &s;ucceeded Con&s;tantine his &s;on; then Vortiger, who u&s;urped the crown; but being hara&s;&s;ed by the Scots and Picts in 440, and to maintain his u&s;urpation, fir&s;t called in the Saxons, at that time hovering along the coa&s;t of Britain, in 446
<PB N="35" REF="39">
The&s;e having got &s;ure footing in the i&s;land, never left the Britons quiet till they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole. And though they were overthrown in many battles by King Vortimer, the &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Vortiger, and afterwards by King Arthur, yet the Britons were, &s;oon after his death, &s;o broken and weakened, that they were forced at la&s;t to retreat, and exchange this &s;weet and rich part of Britain for the mountains of Wales. Cadwallader, la&s;t king of the Britons, began to reign 660, killed in battle Lothair, king of Kent; and Ethelwold, king of the We&s;t Saxons, turned monk and died at Rome.&mdash; Thus the Britons left the &s;tage, and the Saxons en|tered. By the&s;e the country was divided into &s;even kingdoms, called the Heptarchy. Kent, the fir&s;t kingdom, was in Julius Cae&s;ar's time, the &s;overeignty of four petty princes, and never called a kingdom, till Hengi&s;t erected it into one.</P>

<P>HENGIST, fir&s;t monarch of Britain, landed in the i&s;le of Thanet, 449; and, after having &s;urprized Vortiger, and put to death a great number of the Britons, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dominions, and laid the foundation of the monarchy.

<P>CHERDIC, 3d monarch, arrived in Britain, and overcame a Briti&s;h &s;overeign, called Natanleod, near Chard, in Hamp&s;hire, in the 7th year of Ella's monarchy; and, about 6 years after, began the kingdom of the We&s;t Saxons, where he reigned 13 years, when he a&s;&s;umed the monarchy, which he continued for the &s;pace of 21 years; and, having two &s;ons, died in 534, the 33d of his kingdom, and the 40th after his arrival.</P>

<P>CHEVLINE, 3d king of the We&s;t Saxons, and 5th monarch, &s;ucceeded his father in both his dignities, and enlarged his kingdom of the We&s;t Saxons; but, treating his &s;ubjects with contempt, he was by them compelled to abdicate his throne, in the 33d year of his reign, and died in bani&s;hment, in 592.

into a mona&s;tery. This king was the fir&s;t that cau&s;ed the laws of the land to be collected, and tran&s;lated into Saxon.

His fir&s;t wife was the daugh|ter of Chilperike, king of France, by whom he had three children, a &s;on and two daughters. He had a &s;econd wife, who&s;e name has not been tran&s;mit|ted to us, being unworthy of remembrance, for marrying her &s;on-in-law after the death of his father. Pope Boniface pre&s;ented Ethelbert's elde&s;t daughter, Ethelburge, with a looking-gla&s;s, and an ivory comb (which was pre&s;erved in Sir Robt.

He conquered Kent, gave that kingdom to Cuthred, and kept their king Pren captive in Mer|cia. He built Winchcomb mona&s;tery in Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire, where he led Pren to the altar, and relea&s;ed him without ran&s;om or entreaty.

<P>EGBERT, 17th king of the We&s;t Saxons, and 19th but fir&s;t &s;ole monarch of the Engli&s;h. He began his reign over the We&s;t Saxons in 800. The Corni&s;h and Welch a&s;&s;ociated again&s;t him, which provoked him to enact a law, commanding no Briton to pre&s;ume to pa&s;s Offa's ditch, and immediate death to his enemies that dur&s;t &s;et foot upon Engli&s;h ground. He took Che&s;ter, and cau&s;ed their broken image of Cadwallo to be thrown down from the we&s;tern gate of London.

In 846 he ordained tithes to be collected, and exempted the clergy from re|gal tributes He vi&s;ited Rome in 847, confirming the grant of Peter-pence, and agreed to pay Rome 300 marks per ann. His &s;on, Ethelbald, obliged him to divide the &s;overeignty with him, 856. He reigned above 20 years, died Jan. 13, 857, and was buried, but removed to Winche&s;ter.

He was born at Wantage, in Berk&s;hire, 849, and obliged to take the field of battle again&s;t the Danes, within one month after his coronation, at Wilton, in Oxford|&s;hire. In the 4th year of his reign they divided their army, one part &s;eized on Exeter, where they wintered, and the other went into Northumber|land. Alfred defeated them at Exeter, but they again made head again&s;t him at Chippenham, in 876, where he was defeated, and again &s;oon after at Bri&s;tol; but he recovered &s;trength, and attacked them in camp, at Abingdon, in Oxford&s;hire.

He divided his kingdom into &s;hires, hun|dreds and tithings; and obliged his nobles to bring up their children to learning, and to induce them thereto, permitted none into office unle&s;s they were learned; and, to enable them to procure that learning, he founded the univer&s;ity of Oxford. He was buried at Winche&s;ter, and had two &s;ons and two daughters.</P>
<P>EDWARD the Elder, his &s;on, &s;ucceeded him, and was crowned at King&s;ton upon Thames, in 901. The kingdom was greatly hara&s;&s;ed by the Danes on his acce&s;&s;ion; but, in 910, two Dani&s;h chiefs were &s;lain at Wolverhampton, in Stafford&s;hire, which &s;topped their ravages. In 911 Leolin, Prince of Wales, did homage to Edward for his principality. He died at Farringdon, in Berk&s;hire, in 924, the 24th year of his reign, and was buried at Winche&s;ter.

This exa&s;perated the Danes, and excited them to revenge their countrymen's deaths; for which purpo&s;e Sweyn landed on the coa&s;t of Devon in 1003, and on the coa&s;t of Nor|folk the year following, when he de&s;troyed the city of Norwich and the town of Thetford; no$ did he quit the kingdom till Ethelred had paid him 36,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> which he, the year following, de|manded as an annual tribute.

<HEAD>SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THIS nation has as great preten&s;ions to antiquity as any in Europe, having, according to their hi&s;torians, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that kingdom for above 2000 years, without ever being entirely conquered; though they have been &s;ubdued at certain periods by the Romans and Engli&s;h, and in a great mea&s;ure over|run by the Danes. They boa&s;t a line of 115 kings, who can all of them deduce their pedigree from Fer|gus I. who was &s;ent by the people of Ireland, and came into Scotland about the time that Alexander the Great took Babylon, viz 330 years before Chri&s;t. As to the origin of the Scots, there are various opini|ons, and the hi&s;torians who contend for their anti|quity, &s;ay they came from Spain. Tho&s;e are oppo&s;ed by others who, in general, &s;uppo&s;e them to be a re|mainder of the Britons, who fled from the Roman &s;ervitude. However, we &s;hall begin with Metel|lanus, the 17th King of Scotland, in the &s;econd year of who&s;e reign Je&s;us Chri&s;t was born; he died in 29, and was &s;ucceeded by Caractacus.</P>

The Boii, or Bavarians, were likewi&s;e &s;ubjected by him, and the Saracens, Huns, Danes, and Normans felt the power of his &s;word.
