By Way of
REPROOF
From one of the PEOPLE called
QUAKERS,
TO
Thomas Bradbury, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><HI>Friend</HI> Thomas Bradbury,</OPENER>
<P>_I Have deemed thee &s;undry
Times to be worthy of Re|buke;
neverthele&s;s I have for|born
to &s;peak unto thee pub|lickly,
de&s;iring rather that
thou &s;houlde&s;t Reform tho&s;e Things where|in
thou ha&s;t done fooli&s;hly. In Times pa&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="3">
thou wer't called a Preacher of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s,
and many of the People flocked unto
thee, being delighted with thy Words:
Howbeit, <HI>Thomas,</HI> thy deficiency was even
then known to many: But when the Wrath
of Men waxed hot again&s;t each other, and
the Love of Brethren began openly to de|cay,
Friends hoped thou woulde&s;t have
&s;hewn thy &s;elf the true Di&s;ciple of him, who
left thee both his Pattern and Precept for
thy Guidance in the right Way, wherein
if thou had'&s;t walk'd carefully, thou &s;hould'&s;t
have obtain'd the Name, and perchance
the Ble&s;&s;ing annexed in the Word, unto the
<HI>Peace-maker.</HI></P>
<P>But contrary-wi&s;e, thou ha&s;t taken part
with Evil-doers, and ha&s;t been bu&s;ie in the
Antichri&s;tian ungodly Work of Strife:
Thou ha&s;t fallen upon the Innocent, with
Words of Bitterne&s;s, engendring Malice and
Envy, whereby thou ha&s;t been Occa&s;i|on
of much Evil-doing, and ha&s;t brought
forth Wrath among thy Brethren.</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>Thomas,</HI> for in this thou ha&s;t done
fooli&s;hly, and fora&s;much as thou oughte&s;t
to be Rebuked, I &s;hall &s;peak plain Words
unto thee, wherewith thou &s;halt not be able
to contend, &s;eeing Truth &s;hall be contain|ed
therein, and &s;eeing thou ha&s;t grieved me
&s;orely in this that thou ha&s;t done; the Evi$
whereof I am dubious whether thou under$
&s;tande&s;t it or not.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="4">
There are, who &s;ow Contention
among Brethren, but their End is Fooli&s;h|ne&s;s.
I fear, <HI>Thomas,</HI> that thou ha&s;t been
of this Number; for I find among thy
publick Works, that thou ha&s;t preached,
That Men &s;hould take Arms, and fight a|gain&s;t
one another, becau&s;e of Tyrants. It
&s;eemeth that thou had&s;t not any ju&s;t Rea|&s;on
to preach &s;uch Things among thy Peo|ple;
fora&s;much as the Queen, under whom
thou then live&s;t, was not deemed worthy
of the Name of a Tyrant; neither do I un|der&s;tand,
that thou or thy People were any
way oppre&s;&s;ed by Her, or that thou did&s;t
alledge any act of Tyranny to be commit|ted
by Her at that Time: But on the con|trary,
Thou, and al&s;o thy People, were
at full Liberty, if &s;o it had &s;eemed good
unto thee to have lived under her <HI>peaceable
and quiet Lives in all Godline&s;s and Hone|&s;ty.</HI>
So that, PLAINLY, <HI>Thomas,</HI> Thou
had&s;t no ju&s;t Rea&s;on to proceed in this thy
Preaching, wherein thou excite&s;t thy Hear|ers
to make War, and give&s;t occa&s;ion to
Men to &s;peak hard Words of thee, as that
thou wa&s;t a Preacher of Sedition, an In|cendiary,
and one that moved to Wrath
and to &s;hedding of Blood. Nay, <HI>Thomas,</HI>
but the&s;e Things are not of good Report,
neither are they found to be agreeable to
the Character given in the Word, to &s;uch
as thou &s;aye&s;t thou art. Thou art Com|manded
<PB N="8" REF="5">
to be <HI>&s;ober,</HI> and not a <HI>Brawler,</HI> as
thou plainly &s;ette&s;t forth thy&s;elf to be.</P>
<P>I find likewi&s;e, that &s;ithence thou could|e&s;t
not bring thy purpo&s;e to pa&s;s in the
Days of the Reign of the &s;aid Queen, and
that rather by the &s;hortne&s;s of the Conti|nuance
of that Ruler, thou could'&s;t not
prevail to cau&s;e the People to fight, and to
&s;hed Blood, thou ha&s;t continued thy evil
De&s;ign in the Days of the King, and bear|e&s;t
thy Te&s;timony loudly for &s;hedding of
Blood, by the way which thou calle&s;t
Ju&s;tice, pointing out unto the Rulers of the
People &s;uch Per&s;ons as thou beare&s;t an
evil Mind towards, without Cau&s;e; and
it &s;eemeth, that not in thy <HI>Preaching-Bench</HI>
only, but in thy Communication with angry
Men, thou art found animating them un|to
Wrath, and unto that Wickedne&s;s which
is forbidden by the Lord; and which, al|beit
that thou thinke&s;t meet to call Ju&s;tice,
Men think otherwi&s;e thereof, and that it
de&s;erveth no other Name than that of <HI>Re|venge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas,
Thomas,</HI> I warn thee, deal no
more in the&s;e Things; there is, to whom
Vengeance belongeth, and who hath for|bidden
thee and me to intermeddle there|with.
Moreover, I Coun&s;el thee to advi&s;e
with the Writers of ancient Times, where|in
thou may'&s;t learn, that Execution of Ju&s;tice
is the mo&s;t difficult Thing in which the
<PB N="9" REF="6">
Sons of Men are at all Concerned, and that
Men are not able at all Times to know
what is Ju&s;tice, or how the &s;ame &s;hould
be di&s;tributed unto each other, fora&s;much
as that often &s;eemeth to be ju&s;t in the Eyes
of Men, which is Oppre&s;&s;ion and Injurious
in the Sight of God. And thou well know|e&s;t,
that &s;uch is the Iniquity of the Days
wherein we live, that oftentimes, what is
called Ju&s;tice in one Day, is called Tyran|ny
and Oppre&s;&s;ion in another Day; and
Men, <HI>e&s;pecially, Thomas, Preaching-Men,
as thou art,</HI> ought much rather to
move their People and their Brethren to
forbear and forgive one another, than to
move and excite them to Severities, and to
executing Revenge upon one another, lea&s;t
the Day come, when that which they call
Ju&s;tice, may be doomed Inju&s;tice, as I told
thee but now.</P>
<P>Thou art not ignorant, <HI>Thomas,</HI> that
many Years agone, on the Thirtieth Day
of the Fir&s;t Month, the &s;ame in which I
write unto thee, &s;ome of thy People, <HI>Preach|ers
as thou art,</HI> u&s;ed the &s;ame Speech, and
excited the People of this Land to Blood,
even to Murther, and that of their Right|ful
Ruler and KING; and thou art not
Ignorant, that in doing thereof, they made
u&s;e of the &s;ame Words which thou lette&s;t
fall lately in one of thy Tavern A&s;&s;emblies,
wherein thou art too frequent; <HI>to wit,</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="7">
doing JUSTICE: I have heard, <HI>Thomas,</HI>
and I &s;uppo&s;e that thou thy&s;elf ha&s;t heard
al&s;o, that many Preachers in tho&s;e Days,
excited the People to cry in a Tumultuous
and un&s;eemly manner, for <HI>Ju&s;tice, Ju&s;tice;</HI>
the &s;ame Voice which is heard from thee
at this Time; And how knowe&s;t thou, O
Man, that the Voices which only call for
<HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> at this time, may not encourage
tho&s;e to whom they cry, to do what is not
Ju&s;t, and to &s;hed Innocent Blood, as it was
in that Day? Verily, <HI>Thomas,</HI> I fear thou
knowe&s;t not what thou art employld about;
when ungodly Men, and Men of no Prin|ciples,
<HI>for &s;uch are among the People,</HI> take
upon them&s;elves the Executing their own
Revenge, under the &s;pecious a&s;&s;umed Co|lour
of doing Ju&s;tice upon Offenders; <HI>know|e&s;t
thou</HI> where &s;uch Men will &s;top? And
having Power to interpret Laws, or &s;train
and extend the Ordinances of the Land to
their own Purpo&s;es, knowe&s;t thou what
they will call Law! And what Ju&s;tice!
What Right, and what Wrong? Knowe&s;t
thou not, that <HI>the Wrath of Men worketh
not the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God;</HI> and that
the&s;e Things tend unto Blood, fora&s;much
as ye <HI>know not what Spirit ye are of?</HI> The&s;e
Things are well worthy of thy Con&s;idera|tion,
and that before it be too late; for
Ra&s;hne&s;s and Zeal without Knowledge, are
not in Matters of Blood, as they are in o|ther
<PB N="11" REF="8">
Things: They cannot retrieve by Re|pentance,
the Mi&s;chief which they being
to pa&s;s in the Land, neither can they make
Reparation for Blood, when it is like Water
<HI>&s;pilt upon the Ground, and cannot be gather|ed
up.</HI> I Coun&s;el thee therefore, that thou
forbear to excite thy Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> to do
wickedly; but rather that thou preach to
them that they REPENT, <HI>for the King|dom
of Heaven is at Hand;</HI> which I meekly
adverti&s;e thee is the proper Duty of thy Em|ployment,
whereas the other is the Work
of Darkne&s;s, and tendeth to Blood.</P>
<P>Thou wilt, <HI>or it's much,</HI> be provoked to
Anger at my Words, and &s;ay, I am plead|ing
for <HI>Baal;</HI> but thy own Ways &s;hall re|prove
thee herein; for <HI>know, O Man,</HI> that
I am of tho&s;e Friends, who rejoice, in that
it hath plea&s;ed the <HI>King</HI> to take unto him
wi&s;e Coun&s;ellors, and hath not put his
Tru&s;t in tho&s;e who have deceived the Peo|ple;
likewi&s;e I de&s;ire, that the Evil Pro|ceedings
which endanger'd the King's Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
the Crown, may be di&s;cover'd; and
if it &s;hall appear to the King, that any of
the King's Worthies have laid a Confedera|cy,
and have &s;haken Hands with <HI>the Stran|ger,</HI>
that tho&s;e their Evil Doings may be
puni&s;h'd, therefore, fora&s;much as <HI>this is an
Iniquity to be puni&s;h'd by the Judge:</HI> And
moreover, becau&s;e tho&s;e Men had affirm|ed
before the whole Congregation, and
<PB N="12" REF="9">
lifted up their Hands to the Lord, that they
did freely and heartily Renounce the &s;aid
<HI>Stranger,</HI> &amp;c. and having therefore Lyed
unto the Lord, they ought to be expelled
the Society of the Faithful: But ala&s;s!
<HI>Thomas,</HI> this will not &s;erve thy Turn, nor
&s;atisfie the Thir&s;t after Blood, which the
People whom thou ha&s;t enflamed are di|&s;temper'd
with; for ye are &s;eeking after
Evil Things, and &s;triving to involve the In|nocent
in the Errors of the Guilty, that
you may entitle them al&s;o unto like Puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e
it &s;eemeth to me, that thou and
many of thy People are Deceivers of your
&s;elves, in the Things wherein thou thus
boldly intermedle&s;t, and that the Thir&s;t
after Blood will appear the more hainous in
thee and them; for that pa&s;&s;ing by the
more open and flagitious Crime of &s;haking
Hands with the <HI>Stranger,</HI> and &s;etting him,
<HI>whom the Lord hath rejected,</HI> upon the
Throne of the King, which I have told
thee, de&s;erves, that tho&s;e who are guilty
thereof, &s;hould <HI>dye the Death.</HI> I &s;ay, &s;etting
this a&s;ide, as a thing whereof thou &s;eeme&s;t
to doubt, that thou &s;halt not bring Witne&s;&s;es
to prove them guilty; it &s;eemeth that thou
woulde&s;t with Earne&s;tne&s;s prevail upon
thy People to call that Trea&s;on, whereof the
People of the Land Rejoice and are exceed|ing
glad; <HI>to wit,</HI> that an End is put to that
<PB N="13" REF="10">
evil Thing call'd War, and that the Nations
of the Earth, and the Princes thereof, have
joyn'd to make Peace. Whatever the migh|$$
Men of Valour who drew Sword (and of
$hom their Enemies &s;ay, that they delighted
$word$ Blood,) may &s;ay of this Thing, yet &s;ure|$$
thou who art a Preacher &s;hould&s;t not be
$rrowful that the Nations are in Peace,
$uch le&s;s &s;hould'&s;t thou joyn with tho&s;e,
$word$ &s;ay, That this Peace is not of the Lord;
$word$ oughte&s;t to know, <HI>Thomas,</HI> that this
$$ace could not have been obtain'd, if the
$$rd had not inclin'd the Heart of the Queen
$word$ make it, to whom he had, from Heaven,
$ven the only lawful Power to do it; and
$od, who has the Hearts of Kings in his
$$nds, &s;o powerfully inclin'd the Heart of
$word$ Queen, as I have lately heard he did,
$en &s;o much that Sleep went from her
$$es, as once from <HI>Aha&s;uerus the King, for
$word$ Salvation of the Lord's People of that Day;</HI>
$word$ that &s;he could have no re&s;t Night or
$word$, till &s;he put an end to the Day of Blood
$word$ De&s;olation, which then over&s;pread the
$word$. If this be a Truth, <HI>Thomas,</HI> and
$word$ Work was of God, I coun&s;el thee to
$word$ alone, le&s;t haply thou be'&s;t found to
$word$ again&s;t God.</P>
<P>$$beit the Conditions whereon this Peace
$$ain'd plea&s;e thee not, yet if it pleas'd
$word$ Lord, that this Peace, and on the&s;e
$$itions, &s;hould be made, Wilt thou &s;hut
<PB N="14" REF="11">
thine Eyes and &s;top thine Ears again&s;t th$
Voice of &s;upernatural Power, and fallin$
on the In&s;truments only&punc; deny thereby th$
In&s;trumentality of Providence, in a Wor$
of &s;uch a mighty Nature? I advi&s;e thee $word$
<HI>beware</HI> how thou behave in this Point, lea$$
it bring Shame to thee and to thy Friends$
when peradventure ye &s;hall fail al&s;o in th$$
Evil ye have invented again&s;t innocent Pe$$&s;ons,
and the injur'd Men &s;hall cry un$$
the Lord again&s;t the Oppre&s;&s;ion, which $word$
have de&s;ign'd for them to ruin and oppre$$
them, and he &s;hall hear and &s;ave them $word$
of your Hands; for be it known unto the
<HI>Thomas,</HI> that all tho&s;e who have been, a$
&s;till are, Friends to the Peace, are not wi$$ed
Per&s;ons as thou &s;peake&s;t, neither ha$$
they betrayed the Land and the King; $word$
there are among us, who believe that $word$
Peace was of the Lord, and that the In&s;t$$ments,
whether tho&s;e who had Evil $word$
&s;igns therein, or tho&s;e who had not, $word$
po&s;ing there were of both Kinds am$$
them, were mov'd by &s;upernatural In$$ences,
to bring to pa&s;s what the Lord
$word$ before determin'd to be brought to $word$
whether to the Good or to the Hurt of
our Land.</P>
<P><HI>Beware then,</HI> that thou and the Men, $word$

$hat the Lord and the Queen commanded

$word$ Right to command them to do; for with|$ut
Controver&s;y, thou mu&s;t allow, that what
$word$ Queen had lawful Power to Command,
$$er Servants had lawful Right to perform,
$word$ therein to obey her Voice.</P>
<P>I refrain from Words with thee, <HI>Thomas,</HI>
$$ncerning Things wherein we differ, <HI>to

of which I &s;ee, thou, who art a|$ong
the Men of Blood in high E&s;teem,
$$oulde&s;t be vain in contending with me;
out thou may&s;t contend in this with me,
$word$ thou thinke&s;t it meet; that whether it
$word$ lawful to make Peace or not, was not

the Con&s;ent of any of the People of the $and.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e, it will admit very little Con|$$over&s;y,
albeit thou wilt endeavour to con|$$vert
it with me, whether the Queen

Peace, any of her Servants can be

thou &s;landere&s;t none, neither take&s;t upon

<P>Having &s;poken the&s;e Things to thee in
Meekne&s;s and Soberne&s;s, as well, <HI>and even
much more</HI> for the Reproof of the Children
of thy People, than thy own; I mu&s;t ad|moni&s;h
thee, <HI>Thomas,</HI> of thy Duty, wherein
thou ha&s;t been deficient, and warn thee to
be more faithful in the Di&s;charge thereof&punc;
fora&s;much as that the Iniquities of the Time$$
call loudly upon thee, and upon all who
fear the Lord, and are mov'd by the Spirit
of Truth to bear Te&s;timony again&s;t them&punc;
and <HI>&s;hew the Hou&s;e of Jacob their Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t a&s;&s;umed the Place of a publick$
Reprover of &s;ome, as well as thou wa&s;t$$
al&s;o a publick In&s;tructor of others; and
particularly, <HI>Thomas,</HI> Thou ha&s;t been loud$$
and overmuch bu&s;y in thy Exclamations
again&s;t the Men of the Time who are now
di&s;plac'd, and not only did&s;t reprove their
Offences, but as Men &s;ay, &s;earch'd for Of|fences
in their Behaviour, even where they
could not be found: But it &s;eemeth that
thou thinke&s;t, or woulde&s;t that we &s;hould
<PB N="17" REF="14">
think, that the Men of the&s;e Times, who
are Exalted by the King, in the Room of
tho&s;e who have been Deba&s;ed, are Men
Blamele&s;s, and de&s;erving no Rebuke; whe|ther
it be &s;o in Truth, Yea, or Nay, thou
and I mu&s;t Commune a little. Verily, <HI>Tho|mas,</HI>
it appeareth unto me, That the Ini|quity
of the People aboundeth, even of their
Rulers, in a much greater Manner, than it
did in the Days wherein thou wer't ag|grieved
thereat; and therefore, I mu&s;t en|quire
of thee, How it cometh to pa&s;s, That
thou, <HI>Watchman,</HI> art &s;ilent, in the Day, when
the Cry of our National Offences, like the
Sin of <HI>Sodom,</HI> reacheth up to Heaven? Is
it that thy Partiality is &s;o great, as that it
cau&s;eth thee to &s;hut thy Eyes; and that
being blinded by thy Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons,
thou &s;ee&s;t not the Flood of Wickedne&s;s
which is breaking in upon the Land of thy
Nativity? Or, Art thou afraid to di&s;charge
thy Duty, and &s;peak plainly to Great Men?
There was an <HI>Elijah,</HI> who dur&s;t &s;ay, even
to the King, <HI>Thou art he that troubleth I&s;ra|el.</HI>
There was a <HI>Nathan,</HI> who dur&s;t &s;ay,
even to the King, <HI>Thou art the Man:</HI> But,
Thou, O Man, art &s;ilent, tho' the Per&s;ons
concern'd are Meaner than the King.</P>
<P>What thinke&s;t thou, <HI>Thomas,</HI> of the Pie|ty,
the Religion, the Godline&s;s of the Men
in Power? Are they, who are made under
the King, Rulers of the People; Are they,
<PB N="18" REF="15">
<HI>I &s;ay,</HI> Men fearing God, and <HI>hating Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s?</HI>
Are they &s;uch as <HI>&s;eek the Pro&s;peri|ty
of Zion,</HI> and that <HI>&s;tand in the Gap,</HI> when
the Judgments of God threaten the Land
for the Sin of the Inhabitants? Search thou
the Characters of the&s;e Men; and if thou
dare&s;t to be Hone&s;t, &s;peak from thy Con|&s;cience
in their behalf; for as God him&s;elf
will not be mock'd, neither is this the
Time for thee to Mock thy Brethren.</P>
<P>It was told me, <HI>Thomas,</HI> That in one of
thy late Preachings, thou did'&s;t, indeed, move
the Rulers of the Land to choo&s;e Magi|&s;trates,
&s;uch as were <HI>Men fearing God;</HI> but
that thou did'&s;t omit, that other Qualifica|tion
mention'd in the Words, from whence
that &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ion is quoted; <HI>to wit,
hating Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> They Report of thee,
That either thou wert forgetful of the
Text, or that &s;omething much wor&s;e than
forgetfulne&s;s, was the occa&s;ion of the O|mi&s;&s;ion
thereof; and tho&s;e, who &s;ay the&s;e
Things, Report thee to be a <HI>Time-&s;erver,</HI>
and Partial to thy Friends. But I will Ad|moni&s;h
thee to beware of giving ju&s;t Occa|&s;ion
to Evil Men, to think thee worthy of
Blame; and if thou art di&s;pos'd to accept
of thy Friend's Coun&s;el, I will advi&s;e thee,
how thou &s;halt deliver thy &s;elf from all
that Reproach, which Evil Tongues &s;hall
devi&s;e again&s;t thee, concerning this Thing;
and my Advice to thee is, that according to
<PB N="19" REF="16">
thy Duty, Thou now <HI>lift up thy Voice like a
Trumpet;</HI> that thou Cry aloud, <HI>and &s;pare
not;</HI> &s;pare not thy &s;elf, and &s;pare not thy
wicked Friends; but fearing not their
Wrath, any more than thou did&s;t the
Wrath of the Queen, whom thou unju&s;tly
mi&s;us'd; &s;peak plainly to them, and tell

<P>Verily,
it hath been told me, <HI>Thomas,</HI>
and I rejoice thereat, that certain wicked
and abominable Per&s;ons have already &s;o
far &s;hewed them&s;elves in their Interludes
and Plays, as that they have di&s;plea&s;ed <HI>the
King,</HI> and that he hath been plea&s;ed to cau&s;e
&s;ome Re&s;traint to be laid on them; there|fore
ble&s;&s;ed be the King, and ble&s;&s;ed be the
God of the King, who hath put it in his
Heart to do &s;o. But &s;urely it will be thy
Duty, and the Duty of all tho&s;e who love
the Land of their Nativity, to endeavour
$o let the King under&s;tand, that not only a
Re&s;traint, but a total Di&s;&s;olution of the&s;e
Corporations of <HI>Sathan,</HI> is required at his
Hands; and that unle&s;s it be done, Judg|$ent
and Wrath will be upon his People,
$nd upon the Land.</P>
<P>I am given to under&s;tand, <HI>Friend Thomas,</HI>
$$at if our King were rightly informed of
$he&s;e Things, he would cau&s;e it to be other|$i&s;e
in the Land; and would not &s;uffer
$$il Examples in his own Hou&s;hold to de|$$eive
and to draw a&s;ide the People com|mitted
<PB N="26" REF="23">
to his Charge; for <HI>I wot,</HI> that our
Lord the King meaneth well, and de&s;ireth
with his Heart to do the Things which are
prai&s;e-worthy: But it is not unknown unto
us, that he is yet a Stranger in the Land
which he is &s;et to govern; and it may be,
that he knoweth not fully, as yet, the
Wickedne&s;s of the Imagination of the Hearts
of his People; how willing and forward
they are, to embrace the Works of Darkne&s;s,
and to run blindly upon their own De|&s;truction.
If the King were plainly and
uprightly dealt withal concerning this Mat|ter,
he would not &s;uffer &s;uch Evils to pre|vail,
for that his Heart is Right after the
Laws of God, albeit the Country from
whence he came, has not been governed
after this manner.</P>
<P>It is then requir'd at thy Hands, <HI>Thomas,</HI>
and at the Hands of tho&s;e thy Friends, who
thou calle&s;t the GUIDES of the People, that
ye &s;hould deal truly with the King, and
that ye &s;hould tell the King, or tho&s;e who
are about him; charging them that they
deal faithfully with the King herein: That
unle&s;s &s;peedy Care be taken by them, to
put a Stop to the Growth of Prophane&s;s and
all manner of Wickedne&s;s, which is gon$$
out among the People of the Land, ever
&s;ince the Death of our good Queen, Wrath$
will be upon them, and upon this People
<PB N="27" REF="24">
from the Lord, and <HI>we &s;hall be de&s;troy'd,
both we and our King.</HI></P>
<P>And how cometh it to pa&s;s, <HI>Thomas,</HI> that
thy Mouth hath been &s;topp'd thus long,
and that thou ha&s;t not &s;poken in the Ears of
the People of the&s;e Things: Ha&s;t thou not
&s;een, yea, ha&s;t thou not known, that the
Great Ones act unrighteou&s;ly, and walk
not in the Paths of Truth? Ha&s;t thou not
&s;een, that Prophane&s;s abounds, and that
they have broken out, even with Violence,
in the Ways of Wickedne&s;s, as I told thee,
more than all that have been before them?
Is not this to ju&s;tifie what hath been laid to
their Charge, in a late Book publi&s;h'd, as
Men &s;ay, with evil Intent again&s;t the King,
wherein it is &s;aid, <HI>that not one of the Princes
of the Land who &s;tand before the King at
this Time, have any Fear of God before their
Eyes.</HI> Verily, <HI>Thomas,</HI> this is a Lamenta|tion,
and the whole Land hath Cau&s;e to
mourn therefore; and yet where are the
People, even among tho&s;e whom thou
calle&s;t the <HI>People of the Lord,</HI> who taketh
any notice thereof? But ye cover the Ini|quities
of tho&s;e, who give their Hands to
carry on the Work of the King; as if their
Sins were not to be Reproved, or which is
yet wor&s;e, as if the King's Throne was not
to be E&s;tabli&s;hed by Righteou&s;ne&s;s: Woe
unto them who call Evil Good, and Good
<PB N="28" REF="25">
Evil: The Offences of the&s;e from whom we
look for Salvation to the Land, are more
grievous to Righteous Men, than the wick|edne&s;s
of the Wicked; fora&s;much as this
gives Occa&s;ion to the Enemy to Bla&s;pheme,
and likewi&s;e becau&s;e it cau&s;eth the Delive|rance
which we looked for, to fail.</P>
<P>Thinke&s;t thou, <HI>Thomas,</HI> that the People
of the Lord in this Land, did not expect,
that the King was exalted on the Throne,
to deliver us from Wickedne&s;s, and from
the ungodly Government of the&s;e Men, who
had not the Fear of God before their Eyes
as well as from the Enemies of the publick'
Peace, and from the Tyrannous Oppre&s;&s;ions
of the <HI>Stranger?</HI> Wherefore are we called
upon to give Thanks unto the Lord for our
Deliverance, if we are yet in the Bonds of
Iniquity? <HI>Nay, Thomas,</HI> But the Reforma|tion
of the People of the Land is the Work
of the King, for this hath God highly exalt|ed
him to the Throne, and for this our Ex|pectations
are towards him, which if he
&s;hould not endeavour to accompli&s;h, the
Land will have Cau&s;e to mourn, as much
as now it &s;eemeth that we &s;hould rejoice.
Neither is our Lord the King ignorant here|of,
as I under&s;tand; but it may be, that he
is yet Ignorant of the Behaviour of his
Nobles and Servants, who, as far as lieth in
them, are pulling down the Work which
<PB N="29" REF="26">
the King hath built, and cau&s;ing the Joy
which we have &s;hewed on the Occa&s;ion of
the Coming of the King, to be turned into
$$ourning, fora&s;much as we have Rea&s;on to
$$ar a Cur&s;e, and not a Ble&s;&s;ing, &s;hall at|$$nd
the&s;e Things: For we &s;hall be ill &s;aved
from Oppre&s;&s;ion, if we are &s;uffer'd, nay,
$$courag'd and led by Example, to be
$$ickeder than we were before, even by

<P>How is it, <HI>Thomas,</HI> that thou art &s;ilent,
$$ay, at all tho&s;e Things, &s;eeing thou can&s;t
not gain-&s;ay the Truth hereof? Is it that
thou art not willing to bring the&s;e thy

over-much on that account, for be a&s;&s;ured,

like, unto Men who que&s;tion'd with thee
concerning the&s;e Things; which cau&s;es
me to wonder greatly, why thou &s;houlde&s;t
decline the Performance of the&s;e Things at
<PB N="34" REF="31">
this Time, when thou thoughte&s;t it to be
thy Duty at the Time before mention'd,
and which thou coulde&s;t not refrain from,
as thou &s;aye&s;t, without being blame wor|thy.
Plainly, <HI>Thomas,</HI> thou de&s;erve&s;t Re|buke
in this Matter, and do&s;t openly &s;hew
unto the World, that thou art a Time-&s;er|ver,
and a Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons; and I am
moved in Spirit to u&s;e har&s;her Words unto
thee, but I re&s;train my&s;elf in that, po&s;&s;ibly
thou may'&s;t amend; and I therefore give
thee an Occa&s;ion to te&s;tify thy Repentance,
by a better and more upright Practice,
which I wi&s;h thee to go &s;peedily about.</P>
<P>It behoveth thee, <HI>Thomas,</HI> much rather
to do thus, than to enquire after the Truth
of what I have herein a&s;&s;erted, <HI>to wit,</HI> that
the Great Ones, the Princes, and Heads of
the People, are leading the Ignorant a&s;tray
into Wickedne&s;s, more than did tho&s;e who
went before them.</P>
<P>Howbeit, lea&s;t thou &s;houlde&s;t endeavour
to palliate and extenuate, in behalf of tho&s;e
who are thy Darlings in other re&s;pects, I
mu&s;t lead thee by the Hand, <HI>not by the
No&s;e,</HI> Thomas, <HI>others have done thee that
Office already,</HI> that thou may'&s;t be Convin|ced,
yea, even Confounded, for tho&s;e
whom thou ha&s;t with &s;o great Confidence
taken on thee to recommend as good Men,
and Men fearing God: I do <HI>thee Ju&s;tice,
<PB N="35" REF="32">
Thomas,</HI> and therefore ob&s;erve in thy be|half,
that thy Mode&s;ty would not permit
thee to &s;ay, <HI>They were Men hating Coverou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>It hath been u&s;ual with thee, tho' it ap|peareth
to me, that it was not be&s;eeming
thy Per&s;on; I &s;ay, it hath been u&s;ual with
thee, to Salute the Servants of thy Queen;
&s;uch as Lord&mdash;, and Lord&mdash;, Lord&mdash;,
and Lord&mdash;, with Rude&punc; and
Prophane Titles, and Filthy Words; &s;uch as
<HI>R</HI>&mdash;<HI>B</HI>&mdash;, De&mdash;ees, Who&mdash;ers,
$nd many &s;uch un&s;eemly Speeches, which
$word$ may not Repeat; for the&s;e I would meek|ly
Reprove thee, <HI>Thomas;</HI> howbeit, I &s;hould
not have &s;poken thereof on this Occa&s;ion;
But that thou may'&s;t enquire into the
Lives and Conver&s;ations of thy Friends,
who are call'd Lord&mdash;, Lord&mdash;, Lord
&mdash;, Lord&mdash;, Lord&mdash;, and many
more; and that thou &s;hould'&s;t write the
Hi&s;tory of their Lives, and al&s;o of their
Conver&s;ations, That the People of the Land
$$ay be a&s;&s;ured, they are more Holy, and
$$ore Righteous Per&s;ons; more fearing God,
$nd hating Covetou&s;ne&s;s; more free from
tho&s;e Things, whereof the other were ac|cu&s;ed,
than tho&s;e who went immediately
before them; and if thou can'&s;t not make
the Truth thereof appear, then, <HI>Thomas,</HI>
thou mu&s;t give them the like Appellations,
<PB N="36" REF="33">
or wipe them off from the Characters of
tho&s;e who went before them.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Thomas,</HI> I mu&s;t Commun$$
with thee, yet a while, about the growth$$
of Publick Wickedne&s;s, of which I have
&s;poken, which, perhaps, thou wilt find ou$
&s;ome Quibble to avoid; for thou art a cun|ning
Shaver, and knowe&s;t right well how
to wa&s;h tho&s;e <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> which tho$
would'&s;t &s;hould appear Whiter than others
and thou wilt be ready to &s;ay, That my
Accu&s;ation reacheth to no other Offences
then that of &s;eeing Plays, and &s;uch like <HI>$word$</HI>
bominations, which albeit, thou do&s;t $word$
approve; yet thou may'&s;t think, de&s;erv$$
not to be e&s;teemed a Debauching the Pe$ple,
and leading them to De&s;truction, &s;e$$ing
that tho&s;e Things were publickly pra|ctic'd
by the Great Ones; not in the Day$$
of <HI>Anne</HI> the Queen only, but in all Times
even in the Days of the Years of <HI>Willia$$</HI>
and of <HI>Mary,</HI> the King and Queen, wh$$
were worthily e&s;teem'd among the be&s;t $word$
tho&s;e, who have &s;at on the Throne of the$$
Lands.</P>
<P>But know, O Man! That this is n$$thing
&s;o, and there are who may prove $word$
thee, That <HI>Mary</HI> the Queen, of whom th$$
may'&s;t &s;peak, during her whole Time $word$
&s;itting on the Throne, was &s;eldom &s;een $word$
go into tho&s;e Hou&s;es of Filthine&s;s and A$$bomination,
No, not within their Doors$$
<PB N="37" REF="34">
and that being de&s;ired by &s;ome of the In|&s;truments
of Satan, for &s;uch are always bu|$$&s;ie
about Grea$ Ones, to obtain Counte|nance
to their Devices, &s;he an&s;wered, as I
$$let thee know I have been inform'd, <HI>That
&s;he would not give &s;uch an Example unto the
People of the Land;</HI> neither, <HI>Thomas,</HI> can'&s;t
thou &s;ay, that the King, who&s;e Name was
<HI>William,</HI> was &s;een during his abode here,
above once, (and then apparently to his
Di&s;like) at any of tho&s;e accur&s;ed Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>But, having &s;aid enough of the&s;e Things,
and to Silence thee in the pretence of my
having nothing of Moment but this, of the
<HI>Play-Hou&s;es,</HI> to make my Complaints a|gain&s;t;
<HI>Come thou hither, and I will &s;hew thee
greater Abominations than the&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The Great Ones not Content with Play-Hou&s;es,
and New Societies of the&s;e Chil|dren
of Hell, called <HI>Comedians,</HI> are now &s;et|ting
up, and are preparing to &s;et up <HI>Weekly</HI>
Ma&s;querades, <HI>Circular</HI> Balls, <HI>Nights</HI> for
Gaming and Mu&s;ick <HI>Meetings</HI> in divers Parts
of this great City, and thou may'&s;t meet
with the Adverti&s;ements of the&s;e Things
in the Publick Papers, called News, as if
there were no Offence given thereby, ei|ther
unto God, or unto Good People.</P>
<P>And, What thinke&s;t thou of the&s;e Things,
<HI>Thomas Bradbury?</HI> Are the&s;e <HI>the Ways</HI> by
which the People of this Land are to be
Reformed? And by which the Honour
<PB N="38" REF="35">
and Intere&s;t of Holy Religion is to be main|tained?
Are the&s;e the Steps of thy New$$
Deliverers? If thou &s;peak not <HI>Now;</HI> If <HI>no$$</HI>
thou lift not up thy Voice like a Trumpet
the Blood, or Lo&s;s of the Souls of thy Peo$ple
&s;hall lie at thy Door, and at the Doo$$
of &s;uch of the Teachers of the People, $word$
are in thy Station; for I &s;peak, thro' thee$$
to them all, and they all &s;hall be Guilty, fo$
having been Watchmen in <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and
not having done the Duty of Watchmen:
And after God &s;hall have &s;top'd thy Mouth&punc;
who refu&s;eth to &s;peak when his Honour&punc;
and his Intere&s;t, and Kingdom, is thus Impi|ou&s;ly
invaded, he &s;hall deliver his Churches,
and his People from the Floods that are o|ver-whelming
them, and thine Eyes <HI>&s;hall
not &s;ee it.</HI></P>
<P>But, if thou do'&s;t thy Duty, if thou giv|e&s;t
warning to the Princes of thy People;
if thou &s;peake&s;t boldly, and calle&s;t upon
Men every where to Repent; if thou cry|e&s;t
aloud, and &s;pare&s;t not, &s;pare&s;t not the
Great, the Powerful, the Fierce, the Furi|ous;
if thou &s;pare&s;t not; thy &s;elf, neither
feare&s;t the Face of Man, the Ble&s;&s;ing of a
Nation, ready to Peri&s;h, &s;hall come upon
thee; the Portion of a Righteous Man &s;hall
be thy Reward. God &s;hall own thee and
thy Work, and that in the Face of his and
thy Enemies. Thou &s;halt be a Wall of Fire
