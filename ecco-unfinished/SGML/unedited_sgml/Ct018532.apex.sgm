<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>SOME copies of &s;purious impre&s;&s;ions of this Comedy, and of the Maid of Bath, having been printed and circulated before the application to the Court of Chancery for an Injunction, it has been thought advi&s;able, in vindication of the property of the Editor, as well as in ju&s;tice to the decea&s;ed Author, imme|diately to commit to the pre&s;s genuine editions of the two dramatick pieces above-mentioned, together with the Comedy of the Devil Upon Two Sticks, which had been al&s;o without authority adverti&s;ed for publication.</P>
<P>On in&s;pection of the &s;purious impre&s;&s;ions, it appears, that all the errors of carele&s;s and igno|rant tran&s;cribers are there religiou&s;ly pre&s;erved; and all the additions and improvements, made by the &s;acetious Writer, are omitted. Many in&s;tances of this will occur on peru&s;al of this Comedy; in which, be&s;ides the re&s;toration of &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages always &s;poken on the &s;tage, the Reader will find a whole &s;eene, at the end of the Fir&s;t Act, and another, &s;till more entertaining

and popular, at the beginning of the Third; both which were wholly wanting in the &s;purious Impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Unauthorized publications are not only always detrimental to private property, but commonly prove injurious to the publick: For the copies, being obtained by clande&s;tine and indirect means, are, for the mo&s;t part, as has happened in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, incorrect and imperfect.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by Mr. GARRICK. Spoken by Mr. FOOTE.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>IN trifling works of Fancy, wits agree,</L>
<L>That nothing tickles like a &s;imile:</L>
<L>And &s;o, by way of tuning you to laughter,</L>
<L>With which, I hope, you'll tickle us hereafter,</L>
<L>From our poetick &s;torehou&s;e, we produce</L>
<L>A couple, &s;pick and &s;pan for pre&s;ent u&s;e.</L>
<L>Dramatick writers were, like watchmen, meant</L>
<L>To knock down Vice&mdash;few an&s;wer the intent;</L>
<L>Both &s;hould be quick to &s;ee and &s;eize their game;</L>
<L>But both are &s;ometimes blind, and &s;ometimes lame:</L>
<L>Can tho&s;e cry <HI>&s;tand,</HI> while they them&s;elves are reeling?</L>
<L>Can tho&s;e catch thieves, while they them&s;elves are &s;tealing?</L>
<L>When wanted mo&s;t, the watch a nap will take&mdash;</L>
<L>Are all our comick authors quite awake?</L>
<L>Or, what is wor&s;e, by which they &s;till come near 'em,</L>
<L>Are not you more than half a&s;leep who hear 'em?</L>
<L>I, your old watchman, here have &s;ix'd my &s;tand,</L>
<L>On many a vice and folly laid my hand:</L>
<L>'Twas you cried <HI>watch!</HI> I limp'd at your command.</L>
<L>Let me, like other watchmen, ble&s;s the times,</L>
<L>And take the privilege to nod betimes;</L>
<L>Nor let your frowns now force me on a fright</L>
<L>To cry<HI>&mdash;"Pa&s;t &s;even o'clock, and a cloudy night."</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, with your patience not to be too free,</L>
<L>We'll change the &s;ubject and the &s;imile.</L>
<L>To cha&s;e a &s;muggling crew, who law deride,</L>
<L>We launch a cutter of three guns this tide:</L>
<L>With your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we will make the foe</L>
<L>Sink, or &s;ubmit to CAPTAIN TIMBERTOE,</L>
<L>Ye pirate criticks, fall not foul on me!</L>
<L>If once I &s;ink, I founder in the &s;ea.</L>
<L>In this condition, can I &s;wim to &s;hore?</L>
<L>I'm cork'd, 'tis true; but then I want an oar.</L>
<L>You oft have &s;av'd my little bark from &s;inking:</L>
<L>I am no &s;i$$, &s;ave me from water-drinking!</L>

<P>Change? And pray, ma&s;ter Flaw, how are mine changed for the better? An&s;wer me a few &s;hort que&s;tions, and deny what I &s;ay, if you can. When I was compelled, by the cruel laws of this country, to go into exile for

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>

<P>Like enough.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;Secondly, that the &s;aid Flaw &s;hall circulate, privately and publickly, in taverns, coffee-hou&s;es, Journals, Chronicles, Morning and Evening-Po&s;ts, and Courants, that the &s;aid Felicia is a per&s;on of great addre&s;s and abi|lities; and that, by means of many powerful connections, &s;he is able to procure po&s;ts, places, preferments of all conditions and &s;izes; to rai&s;e ca&s;h for the indigent, and pro|cure good &s;ecurities for &s;uch as are wealthy; &s;uitable matches for people who want hu&s;|bands and wives, and divorces &s;or tho&s;e who wi&s;h to get rid of them.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>Luke Lockup? why, how is it po&s;&s;ible he could&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing of that: Fore&s;eeing, indeed, that &s;uch a thing might po&s;&s;ibly happen, I had provided a couple of people to prove that you were &s;hipwreek'd on the We&s;tern coa&s;t; &s;o that, though you were returned before your time from your travels, it was none of your

<P>Nay, as to that, Mr. Flaw, there is no man living to who&s;e care I would &s;ooner tru&s;t my&s;elf than your own; but &s;ure in this affair we have been both of us rather too quick.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Mr. Flaw, we will po&s;tpone that, if you pla&s;e: I hope I am a little better bred than to mention any thing of my private affairs before ladies; their little ears, &s;weet craturs, &s;hould be tickled with nothing but love.</P>

<P>True, true; but here you may &s;u&s;pend your politene&s;s a little; for, unle&s;s I am mi&s;|taken, it is to this lady's good offices you mu&s;t be oblig'd in your pre&s;ent pur&s;uit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that indeed alters the ca&s;e. Why then, madam, this is my bu&s;ine&s;s at once: You mu&s;t under&s;tand I came over lately from Lime|rick;

<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prodigious! upon my &s;oul, madam, in a hundred miles riding, I did not meet with a human cratur, except &s;heep and oxen, to tell me the road; and I &s;hould have lo&s;t my|&s;elf again and again, but for the mile-&s;tones, that are &s;o kind to an&s;wer your que&s;tions with|out giving you the trouble to a&s;k them: And &s;o, being de&s;irous to fellow my neighbours' ex|ample, I have, madam, made bold to come over before them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right; one would not like to be la&s;t in the cha&s;e.</P>

<P>Nay, madam, the party will lo&s;e no credit by doing what is de&s;ired: The Doc|tor's powers are pretty well known about town; not a more populous preacher within the &s;ound of Bow-bell; I don't mean for the mobility only; <HI>tho&s;e</HI> every canting fellow can catch; the be&s;t people of fa&s;hion ar'n't a&s;hamed to fol|low my Doctor: Not one, madam, of the hum|drum, drawling, long-winded tribe; he never crams congregations, gives them more than they can carry away; not above ten or twelve mi|nutes at mo&s;t.</P>
