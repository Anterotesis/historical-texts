<HEAD>A NEW
VOYAGE
ROUND THE
WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P>_IT has for &s;ome Ages been thought
&s;o wonderful a thing to &s;ail the
Tour or Circle or the Globe,
that when a Man has done this
mighty Feat, he pre&s;ently thinks
it de&s;erves to be recorded like
Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI>'s. So as &s;oon
as Men have acted the Sailor, they come a-&s;hore and
write Books of their Voyage, not only to make a
great Noi&s;e of what they have done them&s;elves,
but pretending to &s;how the way to others to come
after them, they &s;et up for Teachers and Chart
Makers to Po&s;terity. Tho' mo&s;t of them have had
this Misfortune, that whatever Succe&s;s they have
had in the Voyage, they have had very little in
the Relation; except it be to tell us, that a Sea|man
when he comes to the Pre&s;s, is pretty much
out of his Element, and a very good Sailor may
make but a very indifferent Author.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4">
I do not in this, le&s;&s;en the Merit of tho&s;e Gen|tlemen
who have made &s;uch a long Voyage, as that
round the Globe; but I mu&s;t be allow'd to &s;ay, as
the way is now a common Road, the Rea&s;on of it
thoroughly known, and the Occa&s;ion of it more
frequent than in former Times; &s;o the World
has done wondering at it; we no more look up|on
it as a mighty thing, a &s;trange and never heard
of Undertaking; this cannot be now expected of
us, the thing is made familiar, every ordinary
Sailor is able to do it, if his Merchants are but
qualified to furni&s;h him for &s;o long a Voyage; and
he that can carry a Ship to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> may with the
&s;ame Ea&s;e carry it round the World.</P>
<P>Some tell us, it is enough to wonder at a thing
nine Days, one would rea&s;onably then conclude,
that it is enough that &s;ailing round the World
has been wondered at above a Hundred Years: I
&s;hall therefore let the Reader know, that it is
not the Rarity of going round the World that
has occa&s;ion'd this Publication, but if &s;ome Inci|dents
have happened in &s;uch a Voyage, as either
have not happened to others, or as no other
People, tho' performing the &s;ame Voyage, have
taken notice of, then this Account may be worth
publi&s;hing, tho' the thing, <HI>viz.</HI> The Voyage
round the World, be in it &s;elf of no Value.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erv'd, of the &s;everal Navigators
who&s;e Voyages round the World have been pub|li&s;h'd,
that few, if any of them, have diverted us
with that Variety which a Circle of that Length
mu&s;t needs offer. We have very little account of
their Landings, their Diver&s;ions, the Accidents
which happen'd to them, or to others by their
Means; the Stories of their Engagements, when
they have had any Scuffle either with Natives, or
<HI>European</HI> Enemies, are told &s;uperficially and by
<PB N="3" REF="5">
Halves; the Storms and Difficulties at Sea or on
Shore, have no where a full Relation; and all the
re&s;t of their Accounts are generally fill'd up with
Directions for Sailors coming that way, the Bear|ings
of the Land, the Depth of the Channels,
Entrances, and Barrs, at the &s;everal Ports, An|chorage
in the Bays, and Creeks, and the like
Things, u&s;eful indeed for Seamen going thither
again, <HI>and how few are they?</HI> but not at all to the
Purpo&s;e when we come expecting to find the
Hi&s;tory of the Voyage.</P>
<P>Another &s;ort of the&s;e Writers have ju&s;t gi|ven
us their long Journals, tedious Accounts of
their Log-work, how many Leagues they &s;ail'd
every Day; where they had the Winds, when it
blew hard, and when &s;oftly; what Latitude in
every Ob&s;ervation, what Meridian Di&s;tance, and
what Variation of the Compa&s;s. Such is the Ac|count
of Sir <HI>John Narbrough</HI>'s Voyage to the <HI>South
Seas,</HI> adorn'd with I know not how many Charts
of the famous Streight of <HI>Magellan,</HI> a place only
now famous for &s;howing the Ignorance of
Sir <HI>John Narbrough,</HI> and a great many wi&s;e Gentle|men
before him, and for being a Pa&s;&s;age they had
no need to have troubled them&s;elves with, and
which no Body will ever go through any more.</P>
<P>Such al&s;o are the Voyages of Captain <HI>John Wood,</HI>
to <HI>Nova Zemla,</HI> an the Charge of the Publick, in
King <HI>Charles</HI> the IId's time, and <HI>Martin Forbi&s;her</HI>
to the North We&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages, in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s
time; all which, are indeed full of their own
Journals, and the Incidents of &s;ailing, but have
little or nothing of Story in them, for the u&s;e of
&s;uch Readers who never intend to go to Sea, and
yet &s;uch Readers may de&s;ire to hear how it has
far'd with tho&s;e that have, and how Affairs &s;tand
in tho&s;e remote Parts of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
For the&s;e Rea&s;ons, when fir&s;t I &s;et out upon a
crui&s;ing and trading Voyage to the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and re|&s;olv'd
to go any where, and every where that
the Advantage of Trade or the Hopes of Pur|cha&s;e
&s;hould guide us, I al&s;o re&s;olv'd to take &s;uch
exact notice of every thing that pa&s;t within my
Reach, that I would be able, if I liv'd to come
home, to give an Account of my Voyage, differ|ing
from all that I had ever &s;een before, in the
nature of the Ob&s;ervations, as well as the man|ner
of relating them: And as this is perfectly
new in its Form, &s;o I cannot doubt but it will be
agreeabie in the Particulars, &s;eeing either no Voy|age
ever made before, had &s;uch Variety of Inci|dents
happening in it, &s;o u&s;eful and &s;o diverting, or
no Per&s;on that &s;ail'd on tho&s;e Voyages, has
thought fit to publi&s;h them after this manner.</P>
<P>Having been fitted out in the River of <HI>Thames</HI>
&s;o lately as the Year 1713. and on a De&s;ign per|haps
not very con&s;i&s;tent with the Mea&s;ures ta|king
at that time for the putting an End to the
War, I mu&s;t be allowed to own I was at fir&s;t
oblig'd to act not in my own Name, but to put
in a <HI>French</HI> Commander into the Ship, for the
Rea&s;ons which follow, and which tho&s;e who un|der&s;tand
the manner of Trade upon clo&s;ing the
late War, I mean the Trade with <HI>Spain,</HI> will ea|&s;ily
allow to be ju&s;t and well grounded.</P>
<P>During the late War between <HI>Great Britain</HI>
and her Confederates on one &s;ide, and the united
Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> on the other &s;ide, we
all know the <HI>French</HI> had a free Trade into the
<HI>South Seas;</HI> a Trade carried on with the greate&s;t
Advantage, and to the greate&s;t Degree, that any
Particular Commerce has been carried on in the
<PB N="5" REF="7">
World for many Ages pa&s;t; in&s;omuch that we
found the Return of Silver that came back to
<HI>France</HI> by tho&s;e Ships, was not only the enrich|ing
of the Merchants of St. <HI>Malo, Rochell,</HI> and
other Ports in <HI>France,</HI> &s;ome of whom we &s;aw get
immen&s;e E&s;tates in a few Years, even to a Mil|lion
<HI>Sterling</HI> a Man. But it was evident, the
King of <HI>France</HI> him&s;elf was enabled by the Circu|lation
of &s;o much Bullion thro' his Mints, to carry
on that War with very great Advantage.</P>
<P>It was ju&s;t at the Clo&s;e of this War, when
&s;ome Merchants of <HI>London</HI> looking with Envy on
the Succe&s;s of that Trade, and how the <HI>French,</HI>
notwith&s;tanding the Peace, would apparently
carry it on, for &s;ome Years at lea&s;t, to infinite
Advantage, began to con&s;ider whether it might
not be po&s;&s;ible to come in for a Snack with <HI>France,</HI>
as they were ally'd to <HI>Spain,</HI> and yet go abroad
in the Nature of a private Crui&s;er.</P>
<P>To bring this to pa&s;s, it was thought proper
in the fir&s;t place, to get a Share, if po&s;&s;ibe, in
a new De&s;ign of an <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI>
ju&s;t then intended to be &s;et up by
&s;ome <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Merchants, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of an
Imperial Charter, or at lea&s;t under Colour of it;
and &s;o we might go to Sea in a threefold Capacity,
to be made u&s;e of as Occa&s;ion might pre&s;ent; <HI>viz.</HI>
when on the Coa&s;t of <HI>New Spain</HI> we &s;ought to
trade, we were <HI>French</HI> Men, had a <HI>French</HI> Captain,
and a &s;ufficient Number of <HI>French</HI> Seamen, and
<HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> or <HI>Walloon</HI> Seamen, who &s;poke <HI>French,</HI> &s;o to
appear on all proper Occa&s;ions. When at Sea
we met with any <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship worth our while,
we were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Crui&s;ers, had Letters of Mart
from <HI>England,</HI> had no Account of the Peace, and
were fitted for the Attack. And when in the
<HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> we had occa&s;ion to trade, either at the
<PB N="6" REF="8">
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI> Settlements, we &s;hould have Im|perial
Colours, and two <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Merchants at
lea&s;t in Appearance, to tran&s;act every thing as we
found Occa&s;ion. However, this la&s;t part of our
Project fail'd us, that Affair not being fully ripe.</P>
<P>As this my&s;terious Equipment may be liable
to &s;ome Exceptions, and perhaps to &s;ome En|quiries,
I &s;hall for the pre&s;ent conceal my Name,
and that of the Ship al&s;o: By Enquiries, I mean
Enquiries of private Per&s;ons concern'd; for as to
publick Enquiries, we have no Unea&s;ine&s;s, ha|ving
acted nothing in Contradiction to the Rules
and Laws of our Country; but I &s;ay, as to pri|vate
Per&s;ons, it is thought fit to prevent their
Enquiries, to which end, the Captain in who&s;e
Name I write this, gives me leave to make u&s;e
of his Name, and conceal my own.</P>
<P>The Ship &s;ail'd from the River the 20th of <HI>De|cember</HI>
1713. and went directly over to the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Flanders,</HI> lying at an Anchor in <HI>Newport Pitts,</HI>
as they are call'd, where we took in our <HI>French</HI>
Captain <HI>Jean Michael Mirlotte,</HI> who with 32 <HI>French</HI>
Seamen, came on board us in a large Snow from
<HI>Dunkirk,</HI> bringing with them 122 &s;mall Anchors
or Rundlets or Brandy, and &s;ome Hampers and
Casks of <HI>French</HI> Wine in Wicker'd Bottles: While
we were here, we lay under <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours, with
Pendants flying, our Ship being upwards of 500
Tun, and had 46 Guns mounted, mann'd with
356 Men: We took the more Men on board
becau&s;e we re&s;olv'd as Occa&s;ion &s;hould pre&s;ent, to
fit our &s;elves with another Ship, which we did
not que&s;tion we &s;hould meet with in the <HI>South Seas.</HI></P>
<P>We had al&s;o a third De&s;ign in our Voyage,
tho' it may be e&s;teem'd an Accident to the
re&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> We were re&s;olv'd to make &s;ome At|tempts
<PB N="7" REF="9">
for new Di&s;coveries, as Opportunity offer|ed;
and we had two Per&s;ons on board who were
exceedingly well qualified for our Direction in
this part, all which was deriv'd from the follow|ing
Occa&s;ion;</P>
<P>The Per&s;on who was principally concern'd in
the Adventure, was a Man not only of great
Wealth, but of great Worth; he was par|ticularly
addicted to what we call New Di&s;co|veries,
and it was indeed upon his Genius to &s;uch
Things, that the fir&s;t Thought of the Voyage
was founded: This Gentleman told us, that he
had already &s;ent one Ship fully equipt and fur|ni&s;h'd
for a new Attempt, upon the <HI>North We&s;t</HI>
or <HI>North Ea&s;t</HI> Pa&s;&s;ages, which had been &s;o often
in vain tried by former Navigators; and that he
did not que&s;tion the Succe&s;s, becau&s;e he had di|rected
them by new Mea&s;ures, and to &s;teer a
Cour&s;e that was never attempted yet; and his
De&s;ign in our Voyage was to make like Di&s;co|veries
towards the <HI>South</HI> Pole; where, as he &s;aid,
and gave us very good Rea&s;ons for it, he did not
doubt but we might di&s;cover even to the Pole it
&s;elf, and find out New Worlds and new Seas,
which had never been heard of before.</P>
<P>With the&s;e De&s;igns, this Gentleman came in|to
the other part of our Project and contributed
the more largely, and with the more Freedom,
to the whole, upon that Account; in parti|cular,
all the needful Preparations for &s;uch Di&s;co|veries,
were made wholly at his Expence, which
I take Notice of here, as being mo&s;t proper in
the Beginning of our Story, and that the Reader
may the le&s;s wonder at the odd way we took to
perform a Voyage which might with much more
Ea&s;e have been done by the u&s;ual and ordinary
way.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="10">
We &s;ail'd from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Flanders</HI> the &s;econd
of <HI>January,</HI> and without any extraordinary Inci|dent
made the Coa&s;t of <HI>Galloway</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> the
tenth, where we &s;tay'd and took in a very ex|traordinary
Store of Provi&s;ions, three times as
much as u&s;ual; the Beef being al&s;o well pickled or
double pack'd, that we might have a &s;ufficient
Re&s;erve for the Length of our Voyage, re&s;olving
al&s;o to &s;pare it as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>We had a very rich Cargo on board, con&s;i&s;ting
of all &s;orts of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures &s;uitable for the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Trade in their <HI>We&s;t Indies;</HI> and as we
aim'd at nothing of Trade till we came to the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t, we &s;ail'd directly for the <HI>Canary</HI>
I&s;lands; having not fully re&s;olv'd whether we
would make our Voyage to the <HI>South Seas</HI> fir&s;t,
and &s;o round the Globe by the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> as has
been the ordinary way, or whether we would go
fir&s;t by the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> and upon the Di&s;coveries
we were directed to, and then cro&s;s the great
<HI>Pacifick</HI> Ocean to the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> as
was at la&s;t re&s;olv'd.</P>
<P>We made the <HI>Canaries</HI> the eleventh of <HI>February,</HI>
and coming to an Anchor there to take in &s;ome
fre&s;h Water, we put out <HI>French</HI> Colours, and &s;ent
our Boat on Shore, with a <HI>French</HI> Boat&s;wain and
all <HI>French</HI> Seamen, to buy what we wanted: They
brought us on board five Butts or Pipes of Wine,
and &s;ome Provi&s;ions, and having fill'd our Water,
we &s;et Sail again the thirteenth: In this time we
call'd a Council among our &s;elves, by which way
we &s;hould go as above.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I was for going by the Cape of <HI>Good
Hope</HI> fir&s;t, and &s;o to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> then keeping
to the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Java,</HI> go away to the <HI>Moluccoes,</HI>
where I made no doubt to make &s;ome Purcha&s;e among
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Spice I&s;lands, and &s;o go away
<PB N="9" REF="11">
to the <HI>Philippines;</HI> but the whole Ships Company,
I mean of Officers, were again&s;t me in this Scheme,
altho' I told them plainly that the Di&s;coveries
which would he made in &s;uch a Voyage as that,
were the principal Rea&s;ons why our chief Owner
embark'd In the Adventure, and that we ought
to regard the End and De&s;ign of our Voy|age;
that it would certainly in the Clo&s;e of things
amount to the &s;ame, as to Trade, as if we went
the u&s;ual way, &s;eeing the Places we were to go
to, were the &s;ame one way as the other, and it
was only putting the Que&s;tion which we &s;hould
go to fir&s;t; that all the Navigators on &s;uch Voy|ages
as the&s;e, went by the <HI>South Seas</HI> fir&s;t, which
would be no Honour to us at all; but if we went
by the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> fir&s;t, we &s;hould be the fir&s;t that
ever went &s;uch a Voyage, and that we might
make many u&s;eful Discoveries and Experiments
in trying that Cour&s;e; that it would be worth
our while, not only to go that way, but to have
all the World take notice of it, and of us for it.</P>
<P>I u&s;ed a great many Arguments of the like Na|ture,
but they an&s;wer'd me mo&s;t effectually, with
laying before me the Difficulties of the Voyage,
and the contrary Methods of Trade, which, in a
Word, made the going that way impracticable:
Fir&s;t, the Difficulty of the Voyage, over the va&s;t
Ocean call'd the <HI>Pacifick Sea,</HI> or <HI>South Sea,</HI> which,
if we kept a <HI>Southern</HI> Latitude, and took the vari|able
Winds as we &s;hould find them, as I pro|pos'd
to do, might very well be a Voyage of &s;ix
or eight Months, without any &s;ight of Land, or
&s;upply of Provi&s;ions or Water, which was into|lerable;
that as to Trade, it was prepo&s;terous,
and ju&s;t &s;etting the Voyage with the Bottom up|ward;
for as we were loaden with Goods, and
had no Money, our fir&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s was to go to the
<PB N="10" REF="12">
<HI>South Seas,</HI> where our Goods were wanted, and
would &s;ell for Money, and then to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI>
where our Money would be wanting, to buy
other Goods to carry home, and not to go to the
<HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> fir&s;t, where our Goods would not &s;ell,
and where we could buy no other for want of
Money.</P>
<P>This was &s;o &s;trong a way of rea&s;oning, that
they were all again&s;t me, as well <HI>French</HI> as <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
and even the two Agents for Di&s;coveries, &s;ub|mitted
to it; and &s;o we re&s;olv'd to &s;tand away
from the <HI>Canaries,</HI> to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> thence
upon the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Coa&s;t of <HI>South America</HI> to Cape
<HI>Horn,</HI> and then into the <HI>South Seas;</HI> and if we
met with any thing that was <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> by the way,
we re&s;olv'd to make Prize of it, as in a time of
War.</P>
<P>Accordingly we made the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> in
about twenty &s;ix Days, from the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands,
and went on Shore at Cape St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> for
fre&s;h Water, afterwards we put into the Bay of
<HI>All Saints,</HI> got &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ions there, and
about an Hundred very good Hogs, &s;ome of
which we kill'd and pickled up their Fle&s;h, and
carried the re&s;t on board alive, having taken on
board a great Quantity of Roots, and <HI>Maiz,</HI> or
<HI>Indian</HI> Corn, for their Food which they thriv'd
on very well.</P>
<P>It was the la&s;t of <HI>March</HI> when we came to the
Bay, and having &s;tay'd there fourteen Days, to
furni&s;h our &s;elves with all Things we wanted, we
got Intelligence there, that there were three
Ships at the <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> in the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI>
which were preparing to go for <HI>Europe,</HI> and that
they expected two <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Men of War to be their
Convoy, becau&s;e of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Men of War
which were in <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> to Convoy the <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> Fleet.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13">
Their having two <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Men of War with
them for their Convoy, took away a great deal
from the Joy we had entertain'd at the News of
their being there, and we began to think we
&s;hould make little or nothing of it: However,
we re&s;olv'd to &s;ee the utmo&s;t of it, and particu|larly
if our double Appearance would not now
&s;tand us in &s;ome &s;tead.</P>
<P>Accordingly we went away for the River of
<HI>plate,</HI> and as u&s;ual, &s;preading <HI>French</HI> Colours, we
went boldly up to <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and &s;ent in our
Boat, mann'd with <HI>French</HI> Men, pretending to
be homeward bound from the <HI>South Seas</HI> and in
want of Provi&s;ions. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> receiv'd us with
Civility enough, and granted us &s;uch Provi&s;ions
as we wanted; and here we found, to our great
Satisfaction, that there was no &s;uch thing as any
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Man of War there; but they &s;aid they ex|pected
one, and the Governor there for the King
of <HI>Spain</HI> asked our <HI>French</HI> Officer if we would take
one of their Ships under our Convoy; Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Mirlotte</HI> an&s;wer'd him warily, that his Ship was
deep loaden, and foul, and he could not un|dertake
any thing, but if they would keep him
Company, he would do them what Service
he could; but that al&s;o, as they were a rich
Ship, they did not de&s;ign to go directly to <HI>France</HI>
but to <HI>Martinico,</HI> where they expected to meet
with &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Men of War to Convoy them
home. This An&s;wer was &s;o well manag'd, tho'
there was not one Word of Truth in it, that one
of the three Ships, for the other two were not
ready, re&s;olv'd to come away with us, and, in
an evil Hour for them, they did &s;o.</P>
<P>To be &s;hort, we took the innocent <HI>Spaniard</HI> into
our Convoy, and &s;ail'd away to the <HI>Northward</HI>
with them, but were not far at Sea, before we
<PB N="12" REF="14">
let them know what Circum&s;tances they were in,
by the following Method: We were about half
a League a Head of them, when our Captain
bringing too, and haling tip our Cour&s;es, made a
Signal to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for the Captain to come on
board, which he very readily did; as &s;oon as he
was on board, our Captain let him know that
he was our Pri&s;oner, and all his Men, and imme|diately
manning their Boat with thirty of our
own Men, we &s;ent them on board their Ship, to
take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her, but order'd them that they
&s;hould be have civilly to the Men on board, and
plunder nothing: For we made a Promi&s;e to
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain, that his Ship &s;hould not be
plunder'd, upon Condition he would give us a
ju&s;t Account of his loading, and deliver peace|ably
to us what Riches he had on board;
then we al&s;o agreed, that we would re&s;tore him
his Ship, which by the way we found was chiefly
loaden with Hides, Things of no Value to us,
and that the Ship al&s;o, was an old Ve&s;&s;el, &s;trong,
but often doubled, and therefore a very heavy
&s;ailer, and con&s;equently not at all fit for our
purpo&s;e, tho' we greatly wanted a Ship to take
along with us, we having both too many Men,
and being too full of Goods, as I have &s;aid above.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain, tho' &s;urpriz'd with the
Stratagem that had brought him thus into the
Hands of his Enemies, and greatly enrag'd in
his Mind at being circumvented, and trapann'd
out of his Ship, yet &s;hew'd a great Pre|&s;ence
of Mind under his Misfortune; and, as I
verily believe, he would have fought us very
bravely, if we had let him know fairly what we
were, &s;o he did not at all appear dejected at his
Di&s;a&s;ter, but capitulated with us as if he bad
been talking Sword in Hand. And one time
<PB N="13" REF="15">
when our Captain and he could not agree,
and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain was a little threatned, he
grew warm; told the Captain that he might be
ill us'd, being in his Hands, but that he was not
afraid to &s;uffer whatever his ill Fortune had pre|par'd
for him, and he would not, for fear of ill
U&s;age, yield to ba&s;e Conditions; that he was a
Man of Honour, and if he (our Captain) was &s;o
too, he demanded to be put on board his own
Ship again, and he &s;hould &s;ee he knew how to
behave him&s;elf. Our Captain &s;mil'd at that, and
told him, he was not afraid to put him on board
his own Ship and fight for her again, and that
if be did &s;o, he was &s;ure he could not e&s;cape him;
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain &s;mil'd too, and told him he
&s;hould &s;ee (if he did) that he knew the way to
Heaven from the Bottom of the Sea, as well as
any other Road, and that Men of Courage were
never at a lo&s;s to conquer their Enemy one way
or other; intimating, that he would &s;ink by his
Side rather than be taken, and that he would
take care to be but a very indifferent Prize to
him, if he was conquered.</P>
<P>However, we came to better Terms with him
afterward and in &s;hort, having taken on board
all the Silver, which was about 200000 Pieces of
Eight, and whatever el&s;e we met with that was
valuable, among the re&s;t, his Ammunition, and
&s;ix Bra&s;s Guns. We performed Conditions, and
&s;ent him into the <HI>Rio de la Plata</HI> again with his
Ship, to let the other <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captains know
what &s;couring they had e&s;caped.</P>
<P>We got a good Booty here indeed, but were
di&s;appointed of a Ship; however, we were not
&s;o &s;en&s;ible of that Di&s;appointment now, as we
were afterwards: For as we depended upon go|ing
to the <HI>South Seas,</HI> we made no doubt of meet|ing
<PB N="14" REF="16">
with Ve&s;&s;els enough for our purpo&s;e; what
followed, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee.</P>
<P>We had done our Work here, and had neither
any Occa&s;ion or any De&s;ire to lie any longer on
this Coa&s;t, where the Climate was bad, and the
Weather exceeding hot, and where our Men be|gan
to be very unea&s;y, being crowded together
&s;o clo&s;e all in one Ship; &s;o we made the be&s;t of
our way <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>We met with &s;ome &s;tormy Weather in the&s;e
Seas, and particularly a <HI>North We&s;t</HI> Bla&s;t, which
carried us for eleven Days, or thereabouts, a
great way off to Sea: But as we had Sea Room
enough, and a &s;tout &s;trong built Ship under us,
perfectly well prepar'd, tite and firm, we made
light of the Storms we met with, and &s;oon came
into our Voyages way again; &s;o that about the
fourth of <HI>May</HI> we made Land in the Latitude of
45 Degrees 12 Minutes <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>We put in here for fre&s;h Water, and finding
nothing of the Land mark'd in our Charts, we
had no knowledge of the place, but coming to
an Anchor at about a League from the Shore, our
Boat went in que&s;t of a good watering place; in
pur&s;uit of this, they went up a Creek about two
Leagues more, where they found good Water,
and fill'd &s;ome Casks, and &s;o came on Board to
make their Report.</P>
<P>The next Day we came into the Creeks Mouth
where we found &s;ix to eight Fathom Water
within Cables Length of the Shore, and found
fre&s;h Water enough, but no People or Cattle,
tho' an excellent Country for both.</P>
<P>Of this Country, I made many Ob&s;ervations,
&s;uitable to the De&s;ign and De&s;ire of our ingeni|ous
Imployer and Owner, and which are one
end of publi&s;hing this Voyage: I &s;hall mention
<PB N="15" REF="17">
only one here, becau&s;e &s;hall come to &s;peak it
again on another Occa&s;ion more largely. My
Ob&s;ervation here, is as follows:
<Q>An Ob&s;ervation concerning the Soil and
Climate of the Continent of America,
South of the River <HI>De la Plata;</HI> and
how &s;uitable to the Genius, the Con&s;ti|tution,
and the Manner of living En|gli&s;hmen,
and con&s;equently for am En|gli&s;h
Colony.</Q></P>
<P>THE particular Spot which I ob&s;erve upon,
is that part of the Continent of <HI>America</HI>
which lies on the Shore of the <HI>North Seas,</HI> as they
are call'd, tho' fal&s;ly; for they are more proper|ly
the <HI>Ea&s;t Seas,</HI> being extended along the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>
Shores of <HI>South America.</HI> The Land lies on the
&s;ame <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> &s;ide of <HI>America,</HI> extended <HI>North</HI> and
<HI>South</HI> from <HI>Coa&s;ta De&s;erta,</HI> in 42 Degrees, to Port
St. <HI>Julian,</HI> in 49 Degrees and a half, being al|mo&s;t
500 Miles in Length, full of very good Har|bours,
and &s;ome navigable Rivers; the Land
is a Plain for &s;everal Scores of Miles within
the Shore; with &s;everal little ri&s;ing Hills, but no
where mountainous or &s;tony; well adapted for
enclo&s;ing, feeding, and grazing of Cattle; al&s;o for
Corn, all &s;orts of which would certainly not only
grow, but thrive very well here; e&s;pecially
Wheat, Rye, Pea&s;e, and Barley, Things which
would &s;oon be improv'd by <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> to the
making the Country rich and populous, the rai|&s;ing
great Quantities of Grain of all Sorts, and
Cattle in Proportion. The Trade which I pro|po&s;e
for the Con&s;umtion or all the Produce, and
<PB N="16" REF="18">
the place whither to be carried, I refer to &s;peak
of by it &s;elf, in the further Pur&s;uit of this Work.</P>
<P>I return now to the Pur&s;uit of our Voyage. We
put to Sea again the tenth of <HI>May,</HI> with fair Wea|ther
and a fair Wind; tho' a Sea&s;on of the Year,
'tis true, when we might have Rea&s;on to expect
&s;ome Storms, being what we might call the Depth
of their Winter. However, the Winds held
<HI>Northerly,</HI> which there are to be e&s;teem'd the
warm Winds, and bringing mild Weather; and
&s;o they did till we came into the Latitude of 50
Degrees, when we had &s;trong Winds and &s;qualy
Weather, with much Snow and Cold, from the
<HI>S. W.</HI> and <HI>S. W.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> which blowing very hard,
we put back to Port St. <HI>Julian,</HI> where we were
not able to &s;tir for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>We weigh'd again the 29th and &s;trood <HI>South</HI>
again pa&s;t the Mouth of the Streights of
<HI>Magellan,</HI> a Streight famous for many Years, for
being thought to be the only Pa&s;&s;age out of the
<HI>North Seas</HI> into the <HI>South Seas,</HI> and therefore I
&s;ay famous &s;ome Ages; not only in the Di&s;co|very
of it by <HI>Magellan,</HI> a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain, but of
&s;uch Significance, that for many Years it was
counted a great Exploit to pa&s;s this Streight,
and few have ever done it of our Nation but that
they have thought fit to tell the World of it, as
an extraordinary Bu&s;ine&s;s, fit to be made publick
as an Honour to their Names. Nay King <HI>Charles</HI>
the IId thought it worth while to &s;end Sir <HI>John
Narbrough</HI> on purpo&s;e to pa&s;s and take an exact
Survey of this Streight, and the Map or Plan of
it has been publi&s;h'd by Sir <HI>John</HI> him&s;elf, at the
publick Expence, as a u&s;eful thing.</P>
<P>Such a mighty and valuable thing al&s;o was
the pa&s;&s;ing this Straight, that Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI>'s
going thro' it, gave birth to that famous old
<PB N="17" REF="19">
Wives Saying, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Sir</HI> Francis Drake <HI>&s;hot
the Gulph;</HI> a Saying that was current in <HI>England</HI>
for many Years, I believe near a Hundred after
Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> was gone his long Journey <HI>of all;</HI>
as if there had been but one Gulph in the World,
and that pa&s;&s;ing it had been a Wonder next to
that of <HI>Hercules</HI> clean&s;ing the <HI>Egean</HI> Stable.</P>
<P>Of this famous place I could not but ob&s;erve
on this Occa&s;ion, that as Ignorance gave it its
fir&s;t Fame, and made it for &s;o many Ages the
mo&s;t eminent part of the Globe, as it was the
only Pa&s;&s;age by which the whole World could be
&s;urrounded, and that it was every Man's Honour
that had pa&s;s'd it, as above; &s;o now it is come
to the full End or Period of its Fame, and will
in all Probability never have the Honour to
have any Ship, Ve&s;&s;el, or Boat, go through it
more, while the World remains, unle&s;s (which
is very improbable) that part of the World
&s;hould come to be fully inhabited. I know &s;ome
are of Opinion, that before the full Period of the
Earth's Exi&s;tence, all the remote&s;t and mo&s;t bar|ren
Parts of it &s;hall be peopled; but I &s;ee no
Ground for &s;uch a Notion, but many Rea&s;ons
which would make it appear to be impracticable,
and indeed impo&s;&s;ible; unle&s;s it &s;hould plea&s;e God
to alter the Sitnation of the Globe as it re&s;pects
the Sun, and place it in a direct, as it now moves
in an oblique Po&s;ition; or that a new Species of
Mankind &s;hould be produced, who might be as
well qualified to live in the Frozen Zone, as we
are in the Temperate, and upon whom the Ex|tremity
of Cold could have no Power. I &s;ay, as
there are &s;everal Parts of the Globe where this
would be impracticable, I &s;hall &s;ay no more than
this, that I think 'tis a groundle&s;s Sugge&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="20">
But to return to our Voyage; we pa&s;s'd by
the Mouth of this famous Streight <HI>De Magellan,</HI>
and tho&s;e others which were pa&s;s'd thro' by
<HI>Le Maire</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man afterwards; and keep|ing
an offing of &s;ix or &s;even Leagues, went away
South, till we came into the Latitude of 58. when
we would, as we had tried three Days before,
have &s;tretched away <HI>South We&s;t,</HI> to have got into
the <HI>South Seas,</HI> but a &s;trong Gale of Wind took us
at <HI>W. N. W.</HI> and tho' we could (lying; near to it)
&s;tretch away to the <HI>Southward,</HI> yet as it over|blow'd,
we could make no <HI>We&s;tward</HI> way; and
tho' we had under us an excellent &s;trong built
Ve&s;&s;el, that valued not the Waves, and made ve|ry
good work of it, yet we went away to Lee|ward
in &s;pight of all we could do, and lo&s;t
Ground amain. We held it out however, the
Weather being clear, but exce&s;&s;ive cold, till we
found our &s;elves in the Latitude of 64.</P>
<P>We call'd our Council &s;everal times, to con|&s;ider
what we &s;hould do, for we did but drive to
Leeward; the longer we &s;trove with it, the
Gale held &s;till, and to our Apprehen&s;ions it was
&s;et in; blowing like a kind of <HI>Mon&s;on,</HI> or <HI>Trade
Wind,</HI> tho' in tho&s;e Latitudes I know there is no
&s;uch thing properly call'd, as a <HI>Trade Wind.</HI></P>
<P>We tried (the Wind abating) to beat up again
to the <HI>North,</HI> and we did &s;o; but it was by run|ning
a great way to the <HI>Ea&s;t;</HI> and once I believe
we were in the Longitude of St. <HI>Helena,</HI> tho' &s;o
far <HI>South,</HI> but it co&s;t us infinite Labour, and near
&s;ix Weeks time, at length we made the Coa&s;t, and
arrived again at the Port of St. <HI>Julian</HI> the 20th of
<HI>June,</HI> which, by the way, is the Depth of their
Winter.</P>
<P>Here we re&s;olv'd to lay up for the Winter,
and not attempt to go &s;o far <HI>South</HI> again at that
<PB N="19" REF="21">
time of Year, but our eager De&s;ire of pur&s;uing
our Voyage prevail'd, and we put out to Sea
again, having taken in fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, &s;uch as
are to be had there; that is to &s;ay, Seals, Pen|guines,
and &s;uch like Trade, and with this Re|cruit
we put to Sea, I &s;ay, a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>We had this time wor&s;e Luck than we had
before, for the Wind &s;etting in at <HI>South We&s;t,</HI>
blew a Storm, and drove us with &s;uch Force
away to Sea <HI>Ea&s;tward,</HI> that we were never able to
make any way to the <HI>Southward</HI> at all, but were
Carried away with a continued Storm of Wind,
from the &s;ame Corner, or near it, our Pilot, or
Ma&s;ter, as we call'd him, finding him&s;elf often
obliged to go away before it, and it kept us
out &s;o long at Sea, and we were gone &s;o far to
the <HI>North Ea&s;t, Ea&s;tward,</HI> that he advi&s;ed us to
&s;tand away for the Cape of <HI>Good Hope;</HI> and ac|cordingly
we did &s;o, and arriv'd at the Cape the
la&s;t Day of <HI>July.</HI> We were now dead hearted
indeed, and I began to revive my Propo&s;al of
going to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> as I had at fir&s;t intended;
and to an&s;wer the Objection which they made
again&s;t it, as being again&s;t the Nature of Trade,
and that we had nothing on board but <HI>European</HI>
Goods, which were not fitted for the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI>
where Money only was &s;uitable to the Market
we were to make. I &s;ay to an&s;wer this Obje|ction,
I told them I would engage that I would
&s;ell our whole Cargo at the <HI>Phillipine</HI> I&s;lands, as
well as on the Coa&s;t of <HI>America;</HI> for that tho&s;e
I&s;lands being <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> our Di&s;gui&s;e of being <HI>French</HI>
would &s;erve us as well at the <HI>Phillipines,</HI> as it
would in <HI>New Spain;</HI> and with this particular
Advantage, that we &s;hould &s;ell here for four
times the Value as we &s;hould on the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Chili,</HI> or <HI>Peru;</HI> and that when we bad done; we
<PB N="20" REF="22">
could load our Ship again there, or in other Pla|ces
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> with &s;uch Goods as would come
to a good Market again in <HI>New Spain.</HI></P>
<P>This I told them was indeed what had not
been practis'd, nor at any other time would it
be practicable: For as it was not u&s;ual for any
Ships to go from the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> to the <HI>Philippines,</HI>
&s;o neither was it u&s;ual for any <HI>European</HI> Ships to
trade with Freedom to the <HI>South Seas,</HI> till &s;ince
the late War, when the <HI>French</HI> had the Priviledge:
and I could not but be amaz'd that the <HI>French</HI> had
never gone this way, where they might have made
three or four Voyages in one, and with much
le&s;s Hazard of meeting with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Dutch</HI>
Crui&s;ers; and have made twice the Profits which
they made the other way, where they were fre|quently
out three or four Years upon one Re|turn;
whereas here they might make no le&s;s than
three Returns, or perhaps four, in the &s;ame Voy|age,
and in much le&s;s time.</P>
<P>They were now a little &s;urprized, for in all
our fir&s;t Debates we had nothing of this Matter
brought in Que&s;tion; only they entertain'd a No|tion
that I was going upon &s;trange Projects, to
make Di&s;coveries, &s;earch for the <HI>South</HI> Pole,
plant new Colonies, and I know not how many
Whims of their own, which were neither in my
De&s;ign, or in my In&s;tructions. The Per&s;on there|fore
who was our <HI>Supra Cargo,</HI> and the other Cap|tain
who&s;e Name I have not mentioned, together
with the <HI>French</HI> Captain <HI>Mirlotte,</HI> and the re&s;t who
had all oppos'd me before, came chearfully into
my Propo&s;al, only the <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> told me in the
Name of the re&s;t, that he began to be more &s;en|&s;ible
of the Advantages of the Voyage I had pro|pos'd,
than he was before; but that us he was
entru&s;ted, together with me, in the Govern|ment
<PB N="21" REF="23">
of the trading part, for I was empower'd
equally with him too, he begg'd I would not take
it ill, that he de&s;ir'd I would let him farther into
that Particular, and explain my &s;elf at lea&s;t as
far as I thought fit.</P>
<P>This was &s;o ju&s;t a Reque&s;t, and &s;o ea&s;y for me
to do, and above all, was made with &s;o much
good Manners and Courte&s;y, that I told him, if I
had been otherwi&s;e determin'd, the courteous
and good humour'd way, with which he requir'd
it, would con&s;train me to it; but that however
I was very ready to do it, as he was entru&s;ted
with the Cargo equally with me, and that it was
a piece of Ju&s;tice to the Owners, that who they
thought fit to tru&s;t, I &s;hould tru&s;t al&s;o; upon
this I told him. My Scheme was as follows:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I told him, that as the <HI>Phillipine</HI> I&s;lands
receiv'd all their <HI>European</HI> Goods from <HI>Acapulco</HI> in
<HI>America</HI> by the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Ships, they were
oblig'd to give what Price was impo&s;ed upon
them by the Merchants, who brought tho&s;e
Goods by &s;o many Stages to <HI>Acapulco.</HI> For Ex|ample;
the <HI>European</HI> Goods, or &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Goods in particular, with which they were load|en,
went fir&s;t from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> from <HI>Ca|diz</HI>
by the Galloons to <HI>Porto Belo,</HI> from <HI>Porto Belo</HI>
to <HI>Panama,</HI> from <HI>Panama</HI> to <HI>Acapulco;</HI> in all
which Places, the Merchants had their &s;everal
Commi&s;ions and other Profits upon the Sale; be|&s;ides
the extravagant Charges of &s;o many &s;everal
ways of Carriage, &s;ome by Water, &s;ome by Land,
and be&s;ides the King's Cu&s;toms in all tho&s;e Pla|ces;
and that after all this, they were brought
by Sea from <HI>Acapulco</HI> to the <HI>Phillipine</HI> I&s;lands,
which was a prodigious Voyage, and were then
generally &s;old in the <HI>Phillippine</HI> I&s;lands at three
Hundred <HI>per Cent.</HI> advance.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="24">
That in the Room of all this, our Cargo being
well bought and well &s;orted, would come to the
<HI>Phillippine</HI> I&s;lands at once, without any landing or
relanding, and without any of all the Additions
of Charge to the fir&s;t Co&s;t, as tho&s;e by the way
of <HI>New Spain</HI> had upon them; &s;o that if we were
to &s;ell them at the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;lands a Hundred
<HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper than the <HI>Spaniards</HI> u&s;ually &s;old,
yet we &s;hould get abundantly more than we could
on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru,</HI> tho' we had been allow'd a
free Trade there.</P>
<P>That there was but two Objections to this Ad|vantage,
and the&s;e were, our Liberty of trading,
and whether the place would con&s;ume the Quan|tity
of Goods we had: And to this I had much to
an&s;wer; Fir&s;t, That it was well known at the
<HI>Phillippine</HI> I&s;les, that the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>
were united firmly together&punc; that the King
of <HI>Spain</HI> had allowed the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Subjects
a free Trade in his <HI>American</HI> Dominions, and con|&s;equently
that it would not be denied there; but
on the other hand, that if it was deny'd by the
Governor, yet there would be room to find out a
Trade with the Inhabitants, and e&s;pecially with
the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and <HI>Japan</HI> Merchants, who were al|ways
there, which Trade, the Governor could
not prevent; and thus we could not fear a Mar|ket
for all our Cargo, if it was much greater than
it was.</P>
<P>That as to the Returns, we had the Advan|tage
either way: For Fir&s;t, We &s;hould be &s;ure
to receive a great part of the Price of our Goods
in <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> or <HI>Japan</HI> Gold and Silver, or in Pieces
of Eight; or it we thought fit to trade another
way, we might take on board &s;uch a Quantity
of <HI>China</HI> Damasks, and other wrought Silks,
Mu$lins, and Chints, <HI>China</HI> Ware, and <HI>Japan</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="25">
Ware; all which, would be immediately &s;old in
<HI>America;</HI> that we &s;hould carry a Cargo of the&s;e
Goods to <HI>New Spain,</HI> infinitely to our Advantage,
being the &s;ame Cargo which the four great <HI>Aca|pulco</HI>
Ships carry back with them every Year:
That when we had gone to the <HI>South Seas</HI> with
this Cargo, of which we knew we &s;hould make a
good Market, we had nothing to do but to come
back, if we thought fit, to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> again,
where we might load for <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Flanders,</HI>
&s;uch Goods as we thought proper; or if we did
not think fit to take &s;o great a Run, we might
go away to the <HI>South,</HI> and round by Cape <HI>Horn</HI>
into the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, and perfect tho&s;e Di&s;co|veries,
which we made part of, in the beginning
of our Voyage.</P>
<P>This was &s;o clear a Scheme of Trade, that he
&s;eem'd &s;urpriz'd with it, and fully &s;atisfied in
every part of it. But the Captain then objected
again&s;t the Length of the Voyage to the <HI>South Seas</HI>
from the <HI>Philippines</HI> and rais'd &s;everal Scruples
about the Latitude which we &s;hould keep in &s;uch
a Voyage; that we &s;hould not be able to carry
any Provi&s;ions which we could take on board in
tho&s;e hot Countries, that would keep for &s;o long
a Run, and &s;everal other Difficulties; to all
which, I made an&s;wer, that when we had &s;old
our Cargo at the <HI>Phillipines,</HI> and found our Ad|vantages
there to an&s;wer our De&s;ires, I would
not oppo&s;e our returning from thence directly to
<HI>England,</HI> if they found it needful; or if they
thought a farther Adventure would not an&s;wer
the Ri&s;ques we were to expect in it; and that we
would never have any Di&s;pute about that.</P>
<P>This &s;atisfied them fully, and they went im|mediately
with the News to the Men, as what
they thought would plea&s;e them wonderfully,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
&s;eeing they were mighty unea&s;y but two or three
Days before, about their being to go back again
to the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> and the Latitude of 64.
where we had not only been twice driven back,
as if Heaven had forbidden us to pa&s;s that way,
but had been driven &s;o far to the <HI>South,</HI> that we
had met with a mo&s;t &s;evere Cold, and which pin|ched
our Men exceedingly, who being come, as
we might &s;ay, a hot Weather Voyage, were but
ill furni&s;h'd for the Weather u&s;ual in the Lati|tudes
of 64.</P>
<P>But we had a harder Task to go through than
we expected, upon this Occa&s;ion; and it may
&s;tand here upon Record, as a Buoy or Beacon to
warn Officers and Commanders of Ships, <HI>Supra
Cargoes,</HI> and &s;uch as are tru&s;ted in the Conduct of
the Voyage, never to have any Di&s;putes among
them&s;elves (I &s;ay not among them&s;elves) about
the Cour&s;e they &s;hall take, or whither they &s;hall
go; for it never fails to come among the Men
after them, and if once the Debate is but named
on the out-&s;ide of the Great Cabin Door, it be|comes
immediately a Di&s;pute among the Officers
upon the Quarter Deck, the Lieutenants, Mates,
Pur&s;er, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from thence it gets afore the Ma&s;t,
and into the Cook Room, and the whole Ship is
immediately divided into Factions and Parties;
every Forema&s;t Man is a Captain, or a Director
to the Captain; every Boat&s;wain, Gunner, Car|penter,
Cock&s;wain, nay, and even the Cook, &s;ets
up for a Leader of the Men; and if two of them
join Parties, 'tis ten to one but it comes to a
Mutiny, and perhaps to one of the two la&s;t Ex|tremes
of all Mutinies, <HI>viz.</HI> running away from
the Ship, or running away with the Ship.</P>
<P>Our Ca&s;e was exactly thus, and had i&s;&s;ued ac|cording
for ought I know, if we had not been
<PB N="25" REF="27">
in a Port, where we got Immediate A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
and that by a more than ordinary Vigor in the
Management too.</P>
<P>I have mentioned the fir&s;t time when we call'd
a Council about our Voyage at the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and
how it was carried again&s;t my Opinion not to go
to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> but to go to the <HI>South Seas,</HI>
about by Cape <HI>Horn:</HI> As the Debate of this was
not at all conceal'd, the Officers of the Ship,
<HI>viz.</HI> the two Lieutenants and two Mates, the
Pur&s;er, and others, came in, and went out, and
not only heard all we &s;aid, but talk'd of it at Li|berty
on the Quarter Deck, and where they
pleas'd, till it went among the whole Ship's
Crew. It is true, there came nothing of all this
at that time, becau&s;e almo&s;t all the Votes being
again&s;t my Opinion, as I have &s;aid already, the
Ship's Company &s;eem'd to join in naturally with
it, and the Men were &s;o talked into the great
Pro&s;pects of Gain to them&s;elves, by a Voyage to
the <HI>South Seas,</HI> that they look'd upon me, who at
the Bottom had the chief Direction of Things, to
be no body, and to have only made a ridiculous
Propo&s;al, which was again&s;t all their Intere&s;t;
and I perceiv'd clearly after this, that they look'd
upon me with an evil Eye, as one that was
again&s;t their Intere&s;t; Nay and treated me with a
&s;ort of Contempt too, as one that had no Power
to hurt them, but as one, that if Things were
left to me, would carry them on a Wild Goo&s;e
Cha&s;e they knew not whither.</P>
<P>I took no Notice of this at fir&s;t, knowing that
in the Proce&s;s of Things I &s;hould have Opportu|nity
enough to let them know I had Power to
oblige them many ways; as al&s;o, that I had Au|thority
&s;ufficient to command the whole Ship,
and that the Direction of the Voyage was prin|cipally
<PB N="26" REF="28">
in me, tho' I being willing to do every
thing friendly, had too ea&s;ily, and I may &s;ay, too
fooli&s;hly, put that to the Vote, which I had a
right to have commanded their Compliance with.
The ill Con&s;equences of which, appear'd not, for
&s;ome time, but broke out upon the Occa&s;ion of
our new Mea&s;ures, as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had determin'd, <HI>as you have heard,</HI>
our Voyage among our &s;elves, in the great Cab|bin,
the <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> and Captain <HI>Mirlotte,</HI> as above,
went out upon the Quarter Deck, and began to
talk of it among the Officers, Mid&s;hipmen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and to give them their Due, they talk'd of it
very hone&s;tly, not with any Complaint of being
over-rul'd, or over-per&s;waded, or the like, but
as a thing that was fully agreed to among us in
the great Cabbin.</P>
<P>The Boat&s;wain, a blunt, &s;urly, bold Fellow,
as &s;oon as he heard of it, <HI>very well, &s;ays he,</HI> &s;o
we are all come back into Captain&mdash;'s blind
Propo&s;al; why this is the &s;ame that every body
rejected at the <HI>Canaries;</HI> and now becau&s;e we are
driven hither by contrary Winds, tho&s;e Winds
mu&s;t be a Rea&s;on why we mu&s;t undertake a pre|po&s;terous,
ridiculous Voyage, that never any
Sailor would have propos'd, and that Man never
went before. What does Captain&mdash;think
that we can't find our way to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ame|rica</HI>
again? and becau&s;e we have met with cro&s;s
Winds, we mu&s;t never meet with fair ones? I
warrant him, let us but go up the Height of
St. <HI>Helena,</HI> we will loon reach the <HI>Rio de la Plata</HI>
and Port St. <HI>Julian</HI> again, and get into the <HI>South
Seas</HI> too, as others have done before us.</P>
<P>The Gunner took it from the Boat&s;wain, and
he talks with one of the Mid&s;hip Men in the &s;ame
Dialect. For my part, &s;ays he, I &s;hipt my &s;elf
<PB N="27" REF="29">
for the <HI>South Seas</HI> when I fir&s;t came a board the
Ship, and in hopes of good Booty, and if we go
thither, I know nothing can hinder us, Wind
and Weather permitting: But this is &s;uch a Voy|age,
as no Man ever attempted before; and
whatever he propo&s;es can have nothing in it for
the Men, but horrid Fateague, violent Heats,
Sickne&s;s, and &s;tarving.</P>
<P>One of the Mates takes it from him, and he
&s;ays as openly, I wonder what <HI>a plague</HI> the re&s;t
of the Gentlemen mean, they were all again&s;t
Captain&mdash;when he &s;tarted this whim&s;ical
Voyage before, and now they come all into it of
a &s;udden, without any Con&s;ideration; and &s;o the
Project of one Man mu&s;t ruin the mo&s;t promi&s;ing
Voyage in the World, and be the Death of above
two Hundred as &s;tout Fellows as ever were toge|ther
in one Ship in this part of the World.</P>
<P>One of the Mid&s;hipmen followed the Mate,
and &s;aid we were all promis'd that another Ship
&s;hould be gotten, either purchas'd or taken, and
that the fir&s;t Ship we took, &s;hould be mann'd
and victualled out of this Ship, where we were
double mann'd and crowded together enough to
bring an Infection among us, in &s;uch hot Climates
as we are going into; and if we were in the <HI>South
Seas,</HI> we &s;hould ea&s;ily buy a Ship, or take a Ship
for our Purpo&s;e, almo&s;t where we would; but
in all this part of the World there is no &s;uch
thing as a Ship fit for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man to &s;et his
Foot in. We were promis'd too, that when we
got into &s;uch a Ship, we that enter'd as Mid&s;hip|men
&s;hould be preferr'd to Offices as we were
qualified, and as our Merit &s;hould recommend us.
What they are going to do with us now, I can't
imagine, unle&s;s it be to turn us a-fore the Ma&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="30">
when half the Forema&s;t Men are dead, and
thrown over Board.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter, or Pilot of the Ship, heard all
the&s;e Things, and &s;ent us word into the great
Cabbin, of all that pa&s;s'd, and, in &s;hort, a&s;&s;ured
us, that if the&s;e Things went a little farther, he
was afraid they would come up to a Mutiny;
that there was great Danger of it already, and
that we ought to apply &s;ome immediate Remedy
to it, or el&s;e he thought it would be too late:
He told me the Particulars al&s;o, and how the
whole Weight of their Re&s;entment &s;eem'd to
tend to a quarelling at my Command, as believing
that this Project of going to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> was
wholly mine; and that the re&s;t of the Officers
being a little influenc'd by the Accident of our
being driven &s;o far out of our way, were only bi|a&s;s'd
in the re&s;t by my Opinion; and as they
were all again&s;t it before, would have been &s;o
&s;till if it had not been for me; and he fear'd, if
they went on, they might enter into &s;ome fatal
Mea&s;ures about me, and perhaps re&s;olve to &s;et
me a &s;hore in &s;ome barren, uninhabited Land or
other, to give me my Belly full of New Di&s;co|veries,
as it &s;eems &s;ome of them had hinted, and
the &s;econd Mate in particular.</P>
<P>I was far from being in&s;en&s;ible of the Danger
I was in, and indeed of the Danger the whole
Voyage, Ship and all, was in; for I made no
Que&s;tion, but that if their bruti&s;h Rage led them
to one villainous Action, they would &s;oon go on
to another; and the Devil would take hold of
that Handle to repre&s;ent the Danger of their be|ing
puni&s;h'd for it when they came home; and
&s;o, as has been often the Ca&s;e, prompt them to
Mutiny again&s;t all Command, and run away with
the Ship.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31">
However, I had pre&s;ence of Mind enough to
enter into proper Mea&s;ures for our general Safe|ty,
and to prevent the wor&s;t in ca&s;e of any At|tempt
upon me, fir&s;t I repre&s;ented the Ca&s;e to
the re&s;t of the Gentlemen, and ask'd if they
would &s;tand by me, and by the Re&s;olutions which
we had taken for the Voyage; then I call'd in to
our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the chief Mate, who was a Kin&s;|man
of one of our Owners, a bold, re&s;olute Gen|tleman,
and the Pur&s;er, who we knew was faith|ful
to us; as al&s;o, the Surgeon, and the Carpen|ter:
I engag'd them all to give me fir&s;t their
Opinions whether they were convinc'd of the
Rea&s;onablene&s;s of my Scheme for the Voyage I
had propos'd; and that they might judge for
them&s;elves, laid it all before them again, ar|guing
every part of it &s;o clearly to them, that
they were convinc'd entirely of its being the
mo&s;t rational Pro&s;pect of the Voyage for us, of
any we could go about.</P>
<P>When I had done this, I recommended it to
them to expo&s;tulate with the Men, and, if po&s;|&s;ible,
to keep them in Temper, and keep them
to their Duty; but at the &s;ame time, to &s;tand all
ready, and upon a Signal which I gave them, to
come all to the Steerage, and defend the great
Cabbin Door with all the other Hands, who they
could be &s;ure of; and in the mean time, to be
very watchful over the Motions of the Men, and
&s;ee what they drove at.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, I fortified my &s;elf with the
<HI>French</HI> Captain, and the <HI>Supra Cargo,</HI> and the
other Captain; and by the way, all the <HI>French</HI>
Captain's Men were true to him (and he true to us)
to a Man. We then brought a &s;ufficient Store of
Ammunition and &s;mall Arms into the great Cab|bin,
<PB N="30" REF="32">
and &s;ecur'd the Steerage, as al&s;o the Round
Hou&s;e, &s;o that we could not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;urpriz'd.</P>
<P>There was nothing done that Night, but the
next Morning I was inform'd, that the Gunner
and &s;econd Mate were in a clo&s;e Cabal togerther,
and one or two of the Mid&s;hipmen, and that they
had &s;worn to one another, not that they would
not go the Voyage as was propos'd, for that
might have ended in their running away, which
I &s;hould not have been &s;orry for; but in &s;hort,
their Oath was, that the Ship &s;hould not go the
Voyage; by which I was pre&s;ently to under&s;tand,
that they had &s;ome Mea&s;ures to take to prevent
my De&s;ign of the Voyage to the <HI>Phillipines,</HI> and
that perhaps this was to run away with the Ship
to <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> which was not far off.</P>
<P>I had however, this apparent Encouragement
in this Ca&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> that as the Contrivance was
yet but two Days old, for it was but two Days
&s;ince they had any Notice of our Intentions to go,
they would be &s;ome Days caballing and forming
an Intere&s;t among the Men, to make up a Party
&s;trong enough to make any Attempt; and that
as I had a &s;trong Set of Men who would be as
diligent the other way, they would be heaving
and contriving one way and the other way to get
the Men over to their Opinion, &s;o that at lea&s;t
it would be &s;ome time before they could make
their Party up.</P>
<P>The thing was rightly conjectured, and the
three Men above who had made them&s;elves the
Head of the Mutineers, went on a pace, and my
Men encrea&s;ed too, as much as could be de&s;ired for
the time; but the <HI>Friday</HI> after, which was about
five Days from the fir&s;t Di&s;covery, one of the
Mid&s;hipmen came and de&s;ir'd to &s;peak with me,
and de&s;ir'd it might not, if po&s;&s;ible, be known
<PB N="31" REF="33">
that he was with me. I ask'd him if he de&s;ir'd
to be alone, he &s;aid no, I might appoint who I
thought convenient that I could tru&s;t, but that
what he had to &s;ay, was of the la&s;t Importance
to all our Lives, and that therefore he hop'd I
would be very &s;ure of them who I tru&s;ted in &s;uch
a Ca&s;e. Upon this I told him, I would name the
chief Mate, the <HI>French</HI> Captain, and the <HI>Supra
Cargo,</HI> and in the mean time, I bid him not be too
much &s;urpriz'd, for that I had already &s;ome War|ning
of the thing which I believ'd he had to tell me
of, and that I was preparing all <HI>Things</HI> to di&s;appoint
it: That however I &s;hould not value his Fidelity
the le&s;s, and that he might &s;peak freely his Mind
before tho&s;e Men, for they were all in the Secret
already, and he might be &s;ure both of Protection
and Reward.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I bid him go out upon the Quar|ter
Deck, and walk there, and that when the
chief Mate went off into the Round Hou&s;e, he
&s;hould go down between Decks as if he was going
into his Cabbin to &s;leep, and that when he heard
the chief Mate call the Cabbin Boy, a Black of
mine, who&s;e Name was <HI>Spartivento,</HI> he &s;hould
take that for a Signal that the Steerage was clear,
and he might come up, and &s;hould be let into the
great Cabbin; all which, was &s;o manag'd, and
in &s;o &s;hort a time, that he was with us in the
great Cabbin in a Quarter of an Hour after the
fir&s;t Conference, and none of the Men per|ceiv'd
it.</P>
<P>Here he let me into the whole Secret, and a
black Project it was; <HI>viz.</HI> That the &s;econd Mate,
the Gunner, three Mid&s;hipmen, the Cox&s;wain,
and about &s;ix and thirty of the Men, had re&s;ol|ved
to mutiny and &s;eize upon all us who were in
the new Project, as they call'd it; and to confine
<PB N="32" REF="34">
us fir&s;t, then to &s;et us on Shore, either there
where we were, or &s;ome where el&s;e, and &s;o carry
the Ship away to the <HI>South Seas,</HI> and then to do
as they found convenient; that is to &s;ay, in a
Word, to &s;eize upon me, the other Captain, the
<HI>French</HI> Captain, the <HI>Supra Cargo,</HI> chief Mate,
Doctor, and Carpenter, with &s;ome others, and
run away with the Ship.</P>
<P>He told me, that they had not fully con&s;ulted
all their Mea&s;ures, nor gain'd &s;o many of the
Men as they intended; that they were to &s;ound
&s;ome more of the Men the next Morning, and as
&s;oon as they had made their dumber up fifty,
they were re&s;olv'd to make the Attempt, which
they did not que&s;tion would be by <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> and
this was <HI>Monday</HI> Morning; and that if they were
then ready, they would make the On&s;et at chan|ging
the Watch the &s;ame Evening. He added,
That as they were to go on Shore the next Mor|ning
for fre&s;h Water, I &s;hould know the Truth
of it by this; that the &s;econd Mate would come
to me, and tell me that they wanted more Wa|ter,
and to know if I plea&s;ed the Boats &s;hould go
on Shore, and that if I plea&s;ed he would go with
them, or any el&s;e who I pleas'd to appoint; and
that upon Suppo&s;ition that I would leave it to
him, to take who he thought fit to go with him,
he would then take Occa&s;ion to choo&s;e the prin|cipal
Con&s;pirators, that they might when they
were on shore, con&s;ult their Mea&s;ures for good
and all.</P>
<P>I had all that Day (<HI>Monday</HI>) to order my Pre|parations,
and upon this plain Intelligence, I re|&s;olv'd
to lo&s;e no time, nor was it long before I
re&s;olv'd what to do; for as their De&s;ign was de|&s;perate,
&s;o I had nothing but de&s;perate Remedies
to provide. Having therefore, as I &s;ay, &s;ettled
<PB N="33" REF="35">
my Mea&s;ures, I call'd for the Cock&s;wain, and bid
him man the Pinnace, for that I was to go on
Shore, and I appointed only the <HI>Supra Cargo,</HI> and
the Surgeon, and the <HI>French</HI> Captain, to go
with me.</P>
<P>There were no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships in the Road, but
there were about five <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships homeward
bound waiting for more, and three outward
bound. As I pa&s;s'd by one of the outward bound
<HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Ships, the <HI>French</HI> Captain, as we had
agreed before, pretended to know the Ship, and
that the Commander was his old Acquaintance,
and ask'd me to give him leave to vi&s;it him, and
told me he was &s;ure he would make us all wel|come.
I &s;eem'd unwilling at fir&s;t, telling him, I
intended to go on Shore and pay my Re&s;pects to
the Governor, and, as was u&s;ual, to ask him
leave to buy &s;ome Provi&s;ions, and that the Go|vernor
would take it very ill if I did not go:
However, upon his alledging that we would not
&s;tay, and that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain upon his going
on board, would, he was &s;ure, give us a Letter
of Recommendation to the Governor, by which
we &s;hould have every thing granted that we could
de&s;ire. Upon this, and his Importunity, I &s;eem|ed
to con&s;ent, and we went all on board.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Merlotte,</HI> who &s;poke <HI>Dutch</HI> very well,
hal'd the Ship, ask'd the Captain's Name, and
then ask'd if he was on Board; they an&s;wer'd
yes, then he bid them tell him the Captain of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship was come to vi&s;it him; upon which,
immediately their chief Mate bad them man the
&s;ide, and &s;tood at the &s;ide to receive us, and before
we could get up, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain came upon
the Quarter Deck to meet me, and with great
Civility invited me into his Cabbin; and while
<PB N="34" REF="36">
we were there, the chief Mate, by the Captain's
Order, entertain'd the Boats Crew with like Ci|vility.</P>
<P>When we were in the Cabbin, Captain <HI>Mer|lotte</HI>
told the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain that we came indeed
to him in the Form of a Vi&s;it, but that our Bu|&s;ine&s;s
was of the greate&s;t Importance, and begg'd
we might &s;peak to him of it in the hearing of
none but &s;uch as he could tru&s;t: The Captain
told us with the greate&s;t open-heartedne&s;s ima|ginable,
that tho' we were Strangers to him, yet
we look'd like hone&s;t Men, and he would grant
our De&s;ire; we &s;hould &s;peak it in the hearing of
none but tho&s;e we could tru&s;t, for there &s;hould be
no body by but our &s;elves.</P>
<P>We made him fully &s;en&s;ible that we knew
how obliging that Compliment was, but begg'd
he would admit any who he thought worthy to
be tru&s;ted with a Secret of the la&s;t Importance.
He then carried it as far t' other way, and told
us, that then he mu&s;t call in the whole Ship's
Company, for that there was not a Man in the
Ship but he could tru&s;t his Life in his Hands.
However, upon the whole, he &s;ent every Body
out of the Cabbin but us three and him&s;elf, and
then de&s;ir'd we would &s;peak our Minds freely.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Merlotte,</HI> who &s;poke <HI>Dutch,</HI> began,
but the Captain interrupted him, and ask'd if
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captain, (meaning me) &s;poke <HI>Dutch;</HI>
he &s;aid no, upon which he ask'd Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI>
if he &s;poke <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and he &s;aid yes, upon which
he let me know that he under&s;tood <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and
de&s;ir'd I would &s;peak to him in <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>I was heartily glad of this, and began imme|diately
with the Story, for we had time little
enough. I told him that he was particularly
<PB N="35" REF="37">
happy, that as he &s;aid, could put his Life in the
Hand of any Man, the meane&s;t in his Ship; that
my Men were unhappily the rever&s;e of his; and
then beginning at the fir&s;t of the Story, I gave
him a full Account of the whole, as related above.</P>
<P>He was extremely affected with it, and ask'd
me what he could do to &s;erve me, and a&s;&s;ur'd
me that he would not only do what in him lay,
but would engage all the Ships in the Road to
do the like, and the Governor al&s;o on Shore. I
thanked him very &s;incerely, and told him, that
what at pre&s;ent was the thing I thought lay be|fore
me, was this, <HI>viz.</HI> that the chief Con&s;pira|tors
would be on Shore to morrow, with one, or
perhaps two, of our Boats, to fetch Water, and
get &s;ome fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, and I would be very
glad to have them &s;eiz'd upon by Surprize, when
they were on Shore, and that then I thought I
could ma&s;ter the re&s;t on Board well enough.</P>
<P>Leave that to me, &s;ays he, I'll give the Gover|nor
Notice this Evening, and as &s;oon as they
come on Shore they &s;hall be all &s;eiz'd; but, &s;ays
he, if you think they may incline to make any
Re&s;i&s;tance, I'll write a Line to the Governor,
and give it you now; then when your Men go on
Shore, order one or two of the principal Rogues
to go and wait on the Governor with the Letter
from you, and when he receives it, he &s;hall &s;e|cure
them there; &s;o they will be divided and ta|ken
with the more Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean time, adds he, while this is doing
on Shore, I'll come on board your Ship, with
my Long Boat and Pinnace, and as many Men as
you plea&s;e, to repay you the Compliment of this
Vi&s;it, and a&s;&s;i&s;t you in reducing the re&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38">
This was &s;o kind, and &s;o compleatly what I
de&s;ir'd, that I could have asked nothing more
or le&s;s; and I accepted his Vi$it in his Barge,
which I thought would be enough, but was afraid
that if more came, our Men might be alarm'd,
and take Arms before I was ready; &s;o we agreed
upon that, and that if I de&s;ir'd more Help, I
&s;hould hang out a Signal, <HI>viz.</HI> a Red Antient on
the Mizen Top.</P>
<P>All Things being thus con&s;ulted, I return'd on
Board, pretending to our Men that I had &s;pent
&s;o much time on Board the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, that I
could not go on Shore; and indeed &s;ome of my
Men were &s;o drunk, that they could &s;carce &s;it
to their Oars; and the Cock&s;wain was &s;o very
drunk, that I took Occa&s;ion to ask Leave pub|lickly,
to leave him on Board till the next Day,
giving the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain al&s;o, a Hint that he
was in the Con&s;piracy, and I &s;hould be glad to
leave him on that Account.</P>
<P>The next Day about nine a Clock, the &s;econd
Mate came to me, and told me they wanted
more Water, and if I plea&s;ed to order the Boat
on Shore, he would go, if I thought fit, and &s;ee
if he could get any fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, the Pur&s;er
being indi&s;po&s;ed: I told him yes, with all my
Heart, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain la&s;t Night had
given me a Letter to the Governor, to de&s;ire we
might be furni&s;h'd with whatever we had Occa|&s;ion
for, and that I had Thoughts of calling for
him to go on Shore and deliver it, and that per|haps
the Governor might make him &s;ome Pre&s;ent
in Compliment to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>He &s;eem'd extremely pleas'd at this, and even
elevated, and going out to give Orders about the
Boat, order'd the Long Boat and the Shallop, and
<PB N="37" REF="39">
came in again, and ask'd me who I pleas'd to have
go along with him; I an&s;wer'd, &s;milingly to
him, pick and choo&s;e them your &s;elf, only leave
the Pinnaces Crew that went with me ye&s;terday,
becau&s;e they mu&s;t go on Board again to carry
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain a little Pre&s;ent of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer
that I am going to &s;end him, and fetch a board
their drunken Cock&s;wain, who was &s;o drunk, we
was fain to leave him behind us.</P>
<P>This was ju&s;t what he wanted; and we found
he cho&s;e all the chief Rogues of the Con&s;piracy;
&s;uch as the Boat&s;wain, the Gunner, the Mid|&s;hipmen
we &s;poke of and &s;uch of the Foremo&s;t
Men as he had &s;ecur'd in his De&s;ign, and of the
re&s;t, we judg'd they were in the Plot, becau&s;e he
took them with him; and thus having the Long
Boat and the Shallop, with about &s;ix and thirty
Men with them, away they went to fill Water.</P>
<P>When they came on Shore, they had pre&s;ent|ly
three <HI>Dutch</HI> Men, &s;et by the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain,
unperceiv'd by them, to be Spies upon them, and
to mark exactly what they did; and at the &s;ame
time, they found three Boats of <HI>Dutch</HI> Men at
the watering place, for the Captain had gotten
two Boats to go on Shore from two other Ships,
full of Men al&s;o, having acquainted them with
the De&s;ign. As &s;oon as our Boats came on Shore,
the Men appear'd to be all very much engag'd
in &s;omething more than ordinary, and in &s;tead of
&s;eparating, as it was expected they &s;hould, they
went all into one Boat, and there they were
mighty bu&s;y engag'd in Di&s;cour&s;e one with ano|ther.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain had given the Charge of
the&s;e Things to a brisk, bald Fellow, his Mate,
and he took the Hints the Captain gave him, &s;o
<PB N="38" REF="40">
well, that nothing could have been better; for
finding the Men thus in a kind of a Cabal, he
takes four of his Men with Muskets on their
Shoulders, like the Governor's Men, and goes
with them to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mens Boat, and asks for
their Officer, the &s;econd Mate, who upon this
appears: He tells them he comes from the Go|vernor,
to know if they were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, and
what their Bu&s;ine&s;s was on Shore there: The
Mate an&s;wer'd, they came from an board the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship, that they were driven there by
&s;tre&s;s of Weather, and hoped they might have
Leave to fill Water and buy Nece&s;&s;aries for their
Money. He told them he &s;uppos'd the Gover|nor
would not refu&s;e them when he knew who
they were, but that it was but good Manners to
ask leave: The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man told him, that he
had not yet fill'd any Water, or bought any Pro|vi&s;ions,
and that he had a Letter to the Gover|nor,
from the Captain, which he &s;uppos'd was to
pay the u&s;ual Civilities to him, and to give him
the Civility of asking leave, as was expected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Man an&s;wer'd, that was <HI>Hael weel,</HI>
that he might go and carry it if he plea&s;ed then,
and if the Governor gave them Leave, all was
right and as it &s;hould be but that the Men
could not be admitted to come on Shore till his
Return. Upon this, away goes the &s;econd Mate
of our Ship, and three of the Men with him,
whereof the Gunner was one; for he had ask'd
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man how many he might carry with
him, and he told him three or four; and tho&s;e
he took, you may be &s;ure were of the particular
Men, who he had a Confidence in, becau&s;e of
their conver&s;ing together by the way.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="41">
When they came to the Governor, the Mate
&s;ent in a Me&s;&s;age fir&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> That he was come
from on board the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship in the Road, and
that he had a Letter from the Captain to his
Excellence. The Governor, who had Notice
given him of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ends out word, that
the Gentlemen &s;hould &s;end in the Letter, and
the Governor would give them an An&s;wer: In
the mean time, there appear'd a Guard of Sol|diers
at the Governor's Hou&s;e, and the four <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
Men were let into the outer Room, where
the Door was &s;hut after them, and the Soldiers
&s;tood without the Door, and more Soldiers in
another Room between them and the Parlour
which the Governor &s;at in.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, the Mate was call'd in, and
the Governor told him, that he had read the
Letter which he brought, and ask'd him, by an
Interpreter, if he knew the Contents of it; he
an&s;wer'd No: The Governor replied, he &s;up|po&s;ed
not, for if he had, he would &s;carce have
brought it; at the &s;ame time told him, he was
oblig'd to make him and all his Men Pri&s;oners, at
the Reque&s;t of their own Captain, for a Con&s;pi|racy
to rai&s;e a Mutiny and run away with the
Ship. Upon which, two great fat <HI>Dutch</HI> Men
came up to him and bid him deliver his Sword,
which he did with &s;ome Reluctance; for he was
a &s;tout, de&s;perate, and &s;trong Fellow; but he
&s;aw it all to no purpo&s;e to di&s;pute or re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, the three Men without were
made Pri&s;oners al&s;o, by the Soldiers. When the
Governor had thus &s;ecur'd the&s;e Men, he call'd
them in and enquir'd the Particulars of the Ca&s;e,
and expo&s;tulated with them very courteou&s;ly up|on
&s;uch a horrid, villainous Practi&s;e, and enquir'd
<PB N="40" REF="42">
of them what the Occa&s;ion could be; and hear|ing
all they had to &s;ay in their Defence, told
them he could do nothing in it more, till their
Captain came on Shore, which would be in a
Day or two, and that in the mean time, they
mu&s;t be content to remain in Cu&s;tody, which
they did, &s;eparated from one another. They
were very civilly treated, but &s;trictly kept from
&s;peaking with one another, or &s;ending any Me&s;|&s;ages
to one another, or to the Boats.</P>
<P>When this was done, the Governor &s;ent &s;ix
Files of Mu&s;queteers down to the watering place,
with Order to &s;ecure all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men in the
two Boats, which was done. They pretended
to make &s;ome Re&s;i&s;tance at fir&s;t, being all very
well arm'd but the Seamen of the three <HI>Dutch</HI>
Long Boats, joining them&s;elves to the Soldiers,
and Notice being given the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen, that
if they fir'd one Gun, they &s;hould have no Quar|ter,
and e&s;pecially their two principal Men, the
chief Mate, and the Gunner, being ab&s;ent, they
&s;ubmitted, and were all made Pri&s;oners al&s;o.</P>
<P>When this was done, of which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Cap|tain
had Notice, by a Signal from the Shore, he
came off in his Shallop, with about &s;ixteen Sea|men,
and five or &s;ix Gentlemen and Officers, to
pay his Vi&s;it to me. I receiv'd him with all the
Appearance of Ceremony imaginable, cau&s;ed a
hand&s;ome Dinner to be prepar'd for him, and
caus'd his Men to be all treated upon the Deck,
and made mighty Preparation for a Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>But in the Middle of all this, Captain <HI>Mer|lotte,</HI>
with all his <HI>French</HI> Men, being thirty two,
appear'd in Arms on the Quarter Deck; the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Captain's Attendants &s;tood to their Arms
on the Main Deck, and I, with the <HI>Supra</HI>
<PB REF="43" MS="Y">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="41" REF="44">
<HI>Cargo,</HI> the Doctor, and the other Captain, lea|ving
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain and &s;ome Men in the
great Cabbin as a Re&s;erve, came to the Steerage
Door, clear'd the Steerage behind me, and &s;tood
there with a Cutla&s;h in my Hand, but &s;aid no|thing;
neither was there a Word &s;poke any
where all the while.</P>
<P>In this Juncture, the chief Mate, the faithful
Mid&s;hipmen, the Carpenter, and the Gunner's
Mate, with about twenty Men, who they could
tru&s;t, went fore and aft between Decks, and &s;e|cur'd
all the particular Men that we had the lea&s;t
Su&s;picion of, being no le&s;s than thirty five more:
The&s;e they &s;ecur'd, bringing them up into the
Steerage, where their Hands were tyed behind
them, and they were commanded not to &s;peak
one Word to one another, upon pain of pre&s;ent
Death.</P>
<P>When this was done, the chief Mate came to
me to the Steerage Door, and pa&s;&s;ing by, went
forward on with his Men, enter'd the Cook
Room, and po&s;ted him&s;elf at the Cook Room
Door. There might be &s;till about eighty Men
upon the Foreca&s;tle, and Mid&s;hips upon the open
Decks; and there they &s;tood &s;taring, and &s;ur|priz'd
at what was doing, but not being able to
gue&s;s in the lea&s;t what was meant, what was the
Cau&s;e of it, or what was intended to be done
farther.</P>
<P>When I found all Things ready, I &s;tept for|ward
a Step or two, and beckoning to the Mate
to command Silence, I told the Men, that I was
not di&s;pos'd to hurt any Man, nor had I done
what I now did, but by Nece&s;&s;ity, and that I ex|pected
they &s;hould all &s;ubmit; that if any one
of them made the lea&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance, he was a dead
<PB N="42" REF="45">
Man, but that if they would be ea&s;y and quiet,
I &s;hould give a very good Account to them all,
of every part of the Voyage, or Scheme of a Voy|age
which I had laid, and which had been &s;o ill
repre&s;ented to them.</P>
<P>Then I cau&s;ed my Commi&s;&s;ionor Letter of Mart
to be read to them all, by which it appear'd, that
I was really chief Commander of the Ship, and
had a right to direct the Voyage as I thought
be&s;t; with a Paper of written In&s;tructions, &s;igu'd
by the Owners and Adventurers, and directed
to me, with another Paper of In&s;tructions to all
the Officers, to be directed by me in all Things;
which indeed, was all News to them, for they
did not think I was the chief Captain or Com|mander
of the Ship and Voyage.</P>
<P>When I had done this, I gave them a long and
full Account of the Rea&s;ons why I thought it be&s;t
as our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances were &s;tated, not to
go to the <HI>South Seas</HI> fir&s;t, but to go away to the <HI>Phil|lipine</HI>
I&s;lands, and what great Pro&s;pect of Advan|tage
to the Owners there was, as well as to the
Men; and that I wondered much that &s;uch Mea|&s;ures
were taking in the Ship as I heard there
were; and that I was not, they might &s;ee, un|provided
of Means to reduce every one of them
to their Duty by Force, and to puni&s;h tho&s;e that
were guilty as they de&s;erv'd; but that I rather
de&s;ir'd to win them by Kindne&s;s; and that there|fore
I had re&s;olv'd, that if any of them had any
rea&s;on to di&s;like the Voyage, they &s;hould be fairly
&s;et on Shore, and &s;hould go to the &s;econd Mate
and his Comrades: And as I named the &s;econd
Mate, I told them what Circum&s;tances they were
in, and how effectually they were &s;ecur'd.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="46">
This a&s;toni&s;h'd them, and &s;urpriz'd them ex|ceedingly,
and &s;ome of them enquir'd more par|ticularly
into the Circum&s;tances of the &s;aid &s;econd
Mate and his Fellows: I told them they were
&s;afe enough, and &s;hould remain &s;o: For as I could
prove they had all a villainous De&s;ign to run
away with the Ship, and &s;et me on Shore, ei|ther
here, or in a wor&s;e place, I thought that
only upon account of my own Safety, &s;uch Men
were not fit to go in the Ship, being once capa|ble
to entertain &s;uch horrid, mi&s;chievous Thoughts,
or that could be guilty of &s;uch a Villany; and that
if any of them were of their Minds, they were
very welcome, if they thought fit, to go to them.
At this Word, &s;ome bold Rogues upon the Fore|ca&s;tle,
which I did not di&s;cern, by rea&s;on of the
Number that &s;tood there, cried out <HI>One and all,</HI>
which was a Cry at that time of Mutiny and Re|bellion,
that Was certain, and in its kind very
dangerous.</P>
<P>However, to let them &s;ee I was not to be
daunted with it, I call'd out to one of the Men
among them, who I &s;aw upon the Foreca&s;tle;
you <HI>Jones, &s;ays I,</HI> tell me who that was, and come
away from them, for I'll make an Example of
him whoever 'tis, <HI>Will. Jones</HI> &s;lunk in among the
re&s;t, and made me no An&s;wer, and immediately
<HI>One and all</HI> was cried again, and a little Huzza
with it, and &s;ome of the Men appear'd to have
&s;ome Fire Arms with them. There was a great
many of them, and I pre&s;ently fore&s;aw, that if I
went to the Extremity, I &s;hould &s;poil the Voy|age,
tho' I conquer'd them; &s;o I bridled my
Pa&s;&s;ion with all my Might, and &s;aid calmly, ve|ry
well Gentlemen, let me know what it is you
mean by <HI>One and all;</HI> I offered any of you that
<PB N="44" REF="47">
did not like to go the Voyage, might quit the
Ship, is that it you intend by <HI>One and all?</HI> If &s;o,
you are welcome, and pray take care to do it im|mediately;
as for what Che&s;ts or Clothes you
have in the Ship, you &s;hall have them all with
you. Upon this I made the chief Mate, who
was now come to me again, advance a little with
&s;ome more Men, and get between the Men up|on
the Foreca&s;tle, and tho&s;e who were upon the
Main Deck; and, as if he had wanted Room,
when he was gotten between them, he &s;aid to
them, &s;tand aft a little Gentlemen, and &s;o crowd|ed
them towards me.</P>
<P>As they came nearer and nearer to where I
&s;tood, I had Opportunity to &s;peak to them
&s;ingly, which I did calmly and &s;miling: <HI>Why how
now Tom,</HI> &s;ays I to one of them, what are you
among the Mutineers? <HI>Lord Sir,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Tom, not I,
they are mad I think, I have nothing to &s;ay to them;
I care not where I go, not I; I'll go round the Globe
with you, its all one to me.</HI> Well <HI>Tom, &s;ays I,</HI> but
what do you do among them then? come away
into the Steerage, <HI>and &s;how your &s;elf an hone&s;t Man.</HI>
So <HI>Tom</HI> comes in, and after him another, and
then two more; upon my &s;aying to <HI>Tom</HI> what do
you do among them, one of the Fellows &s;ays to
one of the Officers that &s;tood at a little Di&s;tance
from me, what does the Captain mean by &s;aying
among them, what does he reckon us to be in the
Plot? He is quite wrong, we are all ignorant,
and &s;urpriz'd at it. He immediately tells me
this, and I was glad, you may be &s;ure, to hear
it, and &s;aid aloud to the Man he &s;poke to, If they
are hone&s;t Men and would not appear in this
Villany, let them go down between Decks and
get out of the way, that they may have no Share
<PB N="45" REF="48">
in the Puni&s;hment, if they have none in the
Crime. <HI>With all my Heart,</HI> &s;ays one <HI>God ble&s;s
you Captain,</HI> &s;ays another, and away they dropt
one by one in at the Steerage Door, and down
between Decks, every one to his Hammock or
Cabbin, till there was not above five, or &s;ix of
Them left.</P>
<P>By this time, our two Boats appear'd from the
Shore, being both mann'd with <HI>Dutch</HI> Men, <HI>viz.</HI>
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain's Mate and about twenty of
his Men, all the Water Casks full, but not a
Man of mine with them, for they were left a
Shore in &s;afe Cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>I waited till they came on Board, and then
turning to the Men on the Foreca&s;tle, I told
them they &s;hould go on Board the Boats imme|diately,
as &s;oon as the Buts of Water were hoi&s;t|ed
in. They &s;till &s;aid <HI>One and all,</HI> they were rea|dy,
de&s;ir'd they might go and fetch their Clothes:
No no &s;ays I, not a Man of you &s;hall &s;et your
Foot any more into the Ship; but go get you in|to
the Boats, and what is your own, &s;hall be gi|ven
you into the Boat.</P>
<P>As I &s;poke this in an angry Tone, and with
a kind of Pa&s;&s;ion, that look'd provok'd to a high
Degree, they began to &s;ee they had no Room to
choo&s;e; and &s;ome of them &s;lipt down the Scuttle
into the Cook Room. I had order'd the Officer
who was there, who was one of the Mid&s;hip|men,
to wink at it, and let as many come down
as offered it, and the hone&s;t Man did more than
that; for he went to the Scuttle him&s;elf, and as
if he had whi&s;per'd, &s;o that I &s;hould not hear him,
call'd them one by one by their Names, and ar|gued
with them: <HI>Prithee Jack,</HI> &s;ays he to one
of them, don't you be di&s;tracted and ruin your
<PB N="46" REF="49">
&s;elf to gratify a ra&s;h drunken Humour; if you
go into the Boat you are undone you will be
&s;eiz'd as &s;oon as you come a Shore as the re&s;t are,
and will be &s;ent to <HI>England</HI> in Irons, and there
you will be infallibly hang'd; why you are cer|tainly
all mad. <HI>Jack</HI> replies, he had no de&s;ign to
mutiny, but the &s;econd Mate drew him in, and
he did not know what to do, he wi&s;h'd he had
not meddled, but he was undone, now what
could he do? <HI>Do,</HI> &s;ays the the Mid&s;hip-man,
leave them for Shame, and &s;lip down here, and
I'll &s;ee and get you off if I can. Accordingly
he pull'd him down, and after him &s;o many got
out of Sight the &s;ame Way that there was not
above Seventeen or Eighteen left upon the Fore|ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>I &s;eem'd to take no Notice of that, till at la&s;t
one of the Men that was left there with his Hat
or Cap in his Hand, &s;tepping ju&s;t to the Edge
of the Foreca&s;tle which was next to me, &s;aid,
with a very re&s;pectful Manner, That I &s;aw how
many had &s;lunk away and made their Peace, or
at lea&s;t obtained Pardon, and that I might, per|haps,
know that they who were left were only
&s;uch as had their Duty there, being placed there
of Cour&s;e before the Mutiny began, and that
they had no Hand in it, but abhorr'd it with
all their Hearts, which he hoped I would con|&s;ider
and not joyn them with tho&s;e that had of|fended,
meerly becau&s;e they came upon the
Foreca&s;tle and mix'd there with the Men who
had the Watch.</P>
<P>I told him if that was true it would be in
their Favour, but I expected he would prove it
to my Satisfaction before I accepted that for an
Excu&s;e. He told me it might, perhaps, be
<PB N="47" REF="50">
hard to prove it, &s;eeing the Boat&s;wain and his
Mate, and the &s;econd Mate were gone, but the
re&s;t of the Ship's Crew could all te&s;tify that they
were a Part of the Men who&s;e Watch it was,
and that they were upon the Foreca&s;tle by the
Nece&s;&s;ity of their Duty and no otherwi&s;e, and
Call'd &s;uch and &s;uch Men who were upon Du|ty
with them to witne&s;s it, who did confirm
it.</P>
<P>Upon this, I found my &s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity,
in Ju&s;tice to the Men, to approve it: But my
own Management was a Bite upon my &s;elf in it;
for tho' I did allow the Mid&s;hip-men to wink
at their &s;lipping away as before, yet I made no
Que&s;tion but I &s;hould have &s;ome left to make
Examples of; but as I could not go back from
the Promi&s;e of Mercy which I had allow'd the
Mid&s;hip-man to offer in my Name: So I trick'd
my &s;elf by their Mi&s;take into a Nece&s;&s;ity of
pardoning them all, which was very far from
my De&s;ign; but there was no Remedy.</P>
<P>However, the Men, when they were &s;o hap|pily
e&s;caped, de&s;ired the Mid&s;hip-men, who had
been in&s;trumental to deliver them, to a&s;&s;ure me,
that as they were &s;en&s;ible they had de&s;erved ve|ry
ill at my Hands, and that yet I had treated
them thus kindly, they would not only reveal
to me all the Particulars of the Con&s;piracy and
the Names of tho&s;e principally concern'd in it,
but that they would a&s;&s;ure me, they would ne|ver
more di&s;pute any of my Mea&s;ures, but were
very ready to do their Duty as Seamen to what
Part of the World &s;oever I might think fit to
go, or which Way I thought fit to carry them;
whether outward or homeward, and that they
gave me the tender of their Duty in this Man|ner
<PB N="48" REF="51">
with the utmo&s;t Sincerity and with Thank|fulne&s;s
for my having forgiven them that Conduct
which was the wor&s;t that a Seaman could be
guilty of.</P>
<P>I took this very kindly, and &s;ent them Word
I did &s;o and that they &s;hould find they had
taken the wi&s;er Cour&s;e, that I had an intire Con|fidence
in their Fidelity and that they &s;hould
never find I would reproach them with, or u&s;e
them the wor&s;e for what had pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was very glad of this Sub|mi&s;&s;ion
of the Men for tho' by the Mea&s;ures I
had taken I was &s;atisfied I &s;hould conquer them,
and that I was &s;afe from their Attempts; yet
carrying it on by Re&s;entment, and doing Ju|&s;tice
upon the Offenders, whatever Advantage
it had one Way, had this Di&s;advantage in the
Con&s;equence; (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it would ruin the Voyage,
for at lea&s;t half the Men were in the Plot.</P>
<P>But having thus conquer'd them by good U|&s;age,
I thought my next Work was to enquire
into the Mi&s;takes which had been the Foun|dation
of all this: So before I parted with the
Men who had returned to their Duty, I told
them, that as I had freely forgiven what was
pa&s;t, &s;o I would keep my Word with them,
that I would never reproach them with it; but
that I thought it was nece&s;&s;ary their Judgments
&s;hould be convinc'd how much they were im|pos'd
upon, as well as their Tempers be re|duced
by my Kindne&s;s to them. That I was of
the Opinion that they had been abu&s;ed in the
Account given them of what I had de&s;ign'd to
do, and of the Rea&s;ons I had to give for doing
it; and I would de&s;ire them to let me know af|terwards,
whether they had been faithfully in|form'd
<PB N="49" REF="52">
of Things or not and whether in their
own Judgment, now when they were freed from
the Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions they were under, they could
object any Thing again&s;t it or no.</P>
<P>This I did with Re&s;pect to the other Men
who I had made Pri&s;oners in the Steerage, who
I had the &s;ame De&s;ign to be kind to as I had to
the&s;e; but upon whom I re&s;olv'd to work this
Way, becau&s;e, after all, I might have this
Work to do over again if I &s;hould meet with
any Di&s;appointment or Mi&s;carriage in the Voyage;
or e&s;pecially if we &s;hould be put to any Straits
or Di&s;tre&s;s in the pur&s;uing it.</P>
<P>In order to this, I cau&s;ed the Voyage it &s;elf,
and the Rea&s;ons of it, the Nature of the Trade
I was to carry on by it, the Pur&s;uit of it to
the <HI>South-Seas;</HI> and in a Word, every Thing
ju&s;t as we had argued and &s;ettled it in the great
Cabbin, to be put into Writing and read to
them.</P>
<P>The Fellows, every one of them, declar'd
they were fully &s;atisfied in the Voyages it &s;elf,
and that my Rea&s;ons for it were perfectly good;
and that they had received a quite different Ac|count
of it; as that I would carry them into
the I&s;land of the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> which was the mo&s;t
unhealthy Part of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> that I would
go away to the <HI>South</HI> for new Di&s;coveries; and
that I would go away thence to the <HI>South-Seas;</HI>
which was a Voyage of &s;uch a Length that no
Ship could victual for; that it was impo&s;&s;ible to
carry fre&s;h Water &s;uch a Length; and in a Word;
that it was a Voyage that would de&s;troy us
all.</P>
<P>It was the chief Mate and the Mid&s;hip-man
who took them all down the Scuttle, that
<PB N="50" REF="53">
brought me this Account from them; &s;o I made
him take two of tho&s;e penitent Mutineers with
him, and go to the Men in the Steerage, who
he had made Pri&s;oners aqt fir&s;t, and &s;ee whether
their Del$$ions were of the &s;ame Kind, and what
kind of Temper they were in: Accordingly he
went to them directly, for this was not a Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
that admitted giving them Time to club
and Cabal together, and form other Societies or
Combinations which might have Con&s;eqnences
fatal to us &s;till.</P>
<P>When he came to them, he told them, the
Captain was willing to do all the Ju&s;tice po&s;&s;ible
to his Men, and to u&s;e them on all Occa&s;ions
with Equity and Kindne&s;s; I ordered him to
enquire calmly what it was had mov'd them to
the&s;e Di&s;orders, and what it was which they
had been made to believe was doing, that they
could enter into Mea&s;ures &s;o de&s;tructive to them|&s;elves,
and to tho&s;e who had entru&s;ted them all
with the Ship and Cargo; for that in a Voyage
every Forema&s;t-man, in his Degree, is tru&s;ted
with the Safety of the whole Ship.</P>
<P>They an&s;wered it was the Mate; that they had
never &s;hewn them&s;elves di&s;contented, much le&s;s
di&s;orderly in the Ship; that they had on all
Occa&s;ions done their Duty thro' the whole
Voyage till now, and that they had no ill De|&s;ign
upon any one, much le&s;s had they any De|&s;ign
to de&s;troy the Voyage or injure the Cap|tain;
but that they were all told by the &s;econd
Mate, that the Captain had impos'd upon them,
that he had propos'd a mad Voyage to the <HI>South
pole</HI> that would murther them all, and that they
were to lay a&s;ide the Trading, and Crui&s;ing
Voyage which they came out upon, and were
<PB N="51" REF="54">
now to &s;pend the whole Voyage in new Di&s;co|veries;
by which the Men could propo&s;e nothing
to them&s;elves but Hard&s;hips, and perhaps pe|ri&s;hing
with Hunger and Cold; whereas, had
they gone to the <HI>South-Seas</HI> as was intended,
they might all have been made; and that the
Hazards with that Pro&s;pect, had &s;ome Sen&s;e
in them; whereas in this Project, there was no|thing
but certain De&s;truction.</P>
<P>The Mate deliver'd them a Copy of the
Scheme I had propos'd, the Rea&s;ons of it, the
Trade I had de&s;ign'd, the Return I was to make,
and every Thing as I have already mention'd
it, and bid them take it and con&s;ider of it.</P>
<P>As I was ju&s;tly provoked to &s;ee how I had
been abu&s;ed and mi&s;repre&s;ented to the Men, &s;o
they were a&s;toni&s;h'd when they read my Scheme
and &s;aw what Mi&s;chiefs they had been led into
for they know not what, and without any Rea|&s;on
or ju&s;t Con&s;ideration: And after they had
debated Things a while among them&s;elves, they
de&s;ir'd the chief Mate might come to them a|gain,
which he did: Then they told him, that
as they had been thus gro&s;sly abus'd and drawn
into mi&s;chiefs which they never de&s;ign'd, by &s;uch
plau&s;ible Pretences, and by being told &s;uch a
long Story full of Lies, and to carry on a
helli&s;h Project of the &s;econd Mates; they hoped
then, being &s;o much impos'd upon, would a lit|tle
extenuate their Fault; than they were con|vinc'd,
hat the Captain had propos'd nothing
but what was very rational, and a Voyage that
might be very profitable to the Owners and to
them&s;elves and they entirely threw them&s;elves
upon the Captain's Mercy, and humbly begg'd
Pardon; that if I pleas'd to forgive them, they
<PB N="52" REF="55">
would endeavour to merit &s;uch Forgivene&s;s by
their future Behaviour; and that in the mean
Time, they &s;ubmitted to what Puni&s;hment I
pleas'd to lay upon them: And particularly,
that as they had for&s;eited, by their Con&s;piracy,
all the Claim they had upon the Ship, and might
ju&s;tly have been turn'd a-&s;hore at the fir&s;t Land
they came to, they were willing to fine a Di&s;|charge
for all their Wages due to them, which
was now near eight Months a Man, and to be
con&s;idered for the re&s;t of the Voyage as they de|&s;erv'd:
That they would all take a Solemn
Oath of Fidelity to me to do their Duty, to go
wherever I would carry them, and to behave
with the greate&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion and Diligence, in
Hopes to regain my Favour by their future
Behaviour, and to &s;hew their Gratitude for the
Pardon I &s;hould grant them.</P>
<P>This was indeed ju&s;t as I would have it, for
I wanted nothing more than to have &s;omething
offered, which I might give them back again;
for I ever thought, and have found it by Expe|rience
to be the be&s;t Way; and Men were al|ways
&s;ecured in their Duty by a generous Kind|ne&s;s,
better than by ab&s;olute Dominion and
Severity: Indeed my Opinion was ju&s;tified in all
the Mea&s;ures I took with the&s;e Men; for as I
found they were &s;ufficiently humbled, and that
I had brought them low enough, I let them
know, that it was not their puni&s;hment but their
Amendment that I de&s;ired; that I &s;corn'd to
make a Prey of them, and take that Forfei|ture
they had offer'd, &s;o putting the Wages due
to them for their Labour in my Pocket. But I
&s;ent them Word, I was very glad to hear that
they were &s;en&s;ible how much they had been
<PB N="53" REF="56">
impos'd upon; that as it was not my De&s;ign to
offer any Thing to them, which they or any ho|ne&s;t
Men ought to refu&s;e, &s;o it was not my De&s;ire
to make any Advantages of their Follies, but what
might tend to bringing them back to their Duty;
that as I had no Pro&s;pect that was incon&s;i&s;tent
with their Safety and intere&s;t, &s;o I &s;corn'd to make
a Profit of their Submi&s;&s;ion; that as to their Wa|ges,
tho' they had forfeited it by their Mutiny,
yet God forbid I &s;hould make it my Profit:
and &s;ince forgiving their Offence was in my
Power, the Crime being in one Particular an
Offence again&s;t me, they &s;hould never be able
to &s;ay I made a Gain of their Submi&s;&s;ion, and
like the Pope &s;hould &s;ell them my Pardon;
that upon their &s;olemn engaging to me never
to offer the lea&s;t Di&s;turbance of any Kind in
the Ship for the future, but to do their Du|ty
faithfully and Chearfully, I would forget all
that was pa&s;t; only this I expected, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
two of them who were particularly guilty of
threat'ning the Life of Captain <HI>Merlotte,</HI> &s;hould
be puni&s;h'd as they de&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>They could not deny but this was mo&s;t ju&s;t;
and they did not &s;o much as offer to intercede
for tho&s;e two: But when one of the two mov'd
the re&s;t, they an&s;wer'd they could not do it,
for they had received Favour enough for them|&s;elves,
and they could not de&s;ire any Thing of
the Captain for their Sakes, for they had all
de&s;erv'd Puni&s;hment as well as they.</P>
<P>In a Word, the two Men were brought to
the Geers, and &s;oundly whipp'd and pickl'd; and
they all prov'd very hone&s;t ever after: And
the&s;e, as I &s;aid at fir&s;t were two and thirty in
all.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="57">
All this while Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> with his <HI>French</HI>
Men were in Arms, and had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion on the
Quarter Deck to the Number of 23 &s;tout Men;
I had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Main-deck with 18 Men
and the 16 <HI>Dutch</HI> Men, and my chief Mate,
with the Mid&s;hip-man had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
Cook-room and the Quarter-deck; the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Captain, our <HI>Supra Cargo,</HI> the Surgeon, and the
other Captain kept the Great Cabbin, with a
Guard of 12 Mu&s;queteers without the Door,
and about 8 more within, be&s;ides Servants.
Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI>'s Man al&s;o had a Guard of
eight Men in the Round-hou&s;e. I had now
nothing to do but with my Men who were on
Shore; and of the&s;e, &s;ix of them were indiffer|ence,
being Men not embark'd in the De&s;ign, but
carried on Shoar by the chief Mate, with a De|&s;ign
to engage them with him; &s;o that indeed
they fell into a Puni&s;hment before they fell into
the Crime, and what to do with the&s;e Men
was the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing I did, was to di&s;mi&s;s my Vi|&s;itor
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain, who I had a great deal
of Rea&s;on to think my &s;elf exceedingly oblig'd
to: And fir&s;t I hand&s;omely rewarded his Men,
to whom I gave four Pieces of Eight a Man; and
having waited on the Captain to the Ship's Side
and &s;een him into his Boat, I fired him 21 Guns
at his going off; for which he fired 25 when
he came on board his Ship. The &s;ame After|noon
I &s;ent my Pinnace on board him for my
drunken Cock&s;wain, and with the Pinnace I &s;ent
the Captain three dozen Bottles of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer,
and a Quarter-cask of Canary, which was the
be&s;t Pre&s;ent I had to make him; and &s;ent eve|ry
one of his other Scamen a Piece of Eight
<PB N="55" REF="58">
<HI>per</HI> Man; and indeed the A&s;&s;i&s;tance I had from
the Ship de&s;erv'd it; and to the Mate who
acted &s;o bravely with my Men on Shore I &s;ent
50 Pieces of Eight.</P>
<P>The next Day I went on Shore to pay my
Re&s;pects to the Governour, when I had all the
Pri&s;oners deliver'd up to me; the &s;ix Men I
cau&s;ed to be immediately &s;et at Liberty, as
having been innocent, and brought all the re&s;t
on board tied Hand and Foot as Pri&s;oners,
and continued them &s;o a great while afterward
as you &s;hall hear: As for the &s;econd Mate, I
tryed him formally by a Council of War, as
I was empower'd by my Commi&s;&s;ion to do, and
&s;entenced him to be hang'd at the Yard Arm:
And tho' I &s;u&s;pended the Execution from Day
to Day, yet I kept him in Expectation of the
Halter every Hour; which, to &s;ome, would have
been as grievous as the Hanging it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus we conquered this de&s;perate Mutiny,
all principally proceeding from &s;uffering the
private Di&s;putes among our &s;elves, which
ought to have been the <HI>Arcana</HI> of the
whole Voyage, and kept as &s;ecret as Death it
&s;elf could have kept it, I mean &s;o, as not to
come among the Seamen afore the Ma&s;t.</P>
<P>We lay here 12 Days, during which Time,
we took in fre&s;h Water as much as we had
Casks for, and was able to &s;tow. On the 13th
Day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> we weighed and &s;tood away
to the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> de&s;igning to make no Land any more
till we came to <HI>Java-Head,</HI> and the <HI>Streights</HI> of
<HI>Sunda;</HI> for that Way we intended to &s;ail: But
the Wind &s;prung up at <HI>E.</HI> and at <HI>E. S. E.</HI> and
blew &s;o fre&s;h, that we was oblig'd, after two
<PB N="56" REF="59">
Days beating again&s;t it, to bear away afore it,
and run back to the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope.</HI></P>
<P>While we were here, there came in two
<HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Men more, homeward bound,
to whom had happened a very odd Accident,
<HI>as follows:</HI> They had been attack'd by a large
Ship of 44 Guns, and a &s;tout Sloop of 8 Guns;
the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships re&s;olving to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another,
&s;tood up to the <HI>French</HI> Man, <HI>for &s;uch it &s;eems he
was,</HI> and fought him very warmly. The En|gagement
la&s;ted &s;ix or &s;even Hours; in which
the Privateer had kill'd them &s;ome Men; but
in the Heat of the Fight, the Sloop receiv'd a
Shot, which brought her Main-ma&s;t by the
Board; and this caus'd the Captain of the Fri|gate
to &s;heer off, fearing his Sloop would be
taken; but the Sloop's Men took Care of them|&s;elves,
for halling a little out of the Fight,
they got into their own Boats, and a Boat
which the Frigate &s;ent to their Help, and a|bandon'd
the Sloop; which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Men per|ceiving,
they mann'd out their Boats, and &s;ent
and took the Sloop with all that was in her,
and brought her away with them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Men came into the Road at the Cape
with this Prize while our Ship was there the
&s;econd Time; and we &s;aw them bringing the
Sloop in a Tow, having no Ma&s;t &s;tanding but
a little Pole-ma&s;t &s;et up for the pre&s;ent, and
her Mizen; which was al&s;o di&s;abled and of
little U&s;e to her.</P>
<P>I no &s;ooner &s;aw her, but it came into my
Thoughts, that if &s;he was any Thing of a Sea-Boat,
&s;he would do our Bu&s;ine&s;s to a Tittle;
and as we had always re&s;olved to get another
Ship, but had been di&s;appointed, this would
<PB N="57" REF="60">
an&s;wer our End exactly: Accordingly I went
with my chief Mate in our Shallop, on board
my old Acquaintance the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain, and
enquiring there, was inform'd of the Ca&s;e, that
it was a Prize taken as above, and that in all
Probability the Captain that took her would be
glad to part with her; and the Captain pro|mi&s;ed
me to go on board the Ship that brought
her in, and enquire about it, and let me know.</P>
<P>Accordingly the next Morning, the Cap|tain
&s;ent me Word I might have her; that
&s;he carried eight Guns, had good Store of Pro|vi&s;ions
on board, with Ammunition &s;ufficient,
and I might have her and all that was in her
for 1200 Pieces of Eight. In a Word, I &s;ent my
chief Mate back with the &s;ame Me&s;&s;enger and
the Money; giving him Commi&s;&s;ion to pay the
Money and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her if he lik'd
her, which he did; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain, my
Friend, lent him 12 Men to bring her off to
us; which they did the &s;ame Day.</P>
<P>I was a little put to it for a Ma&s;t for her,
having not any Thing on board that we could
&s;pare that was &s;it for a Main-ma&s;t: But re&s;olv|ing
at la&s;t to ma&s;t her not as a Sloop, but as a
Brigantine, we made &s;hift with what &s;pare
Pieces we had, and a &s;pare Fortop-ma&s;t, which
one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships help'd me to, &s;o we &s;itted
her up very hand&s;omely, made her carry twelve
Guns, and put 60 Men on board. One of the
be&s;t Things we found on board her, was Cask,
which we greatly wanted, e&s;pecially for Barrel|ling
up Beef and other Provi&s;ions, which we
found very difficult; but our Cooper eked them
out with making &s;ome new ones out of her
old ones.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="61">
After &s;taying here 16 Days more, we fail'd a|gan
indeed, I thought once we &s;hould never have
gone away at all; for it is certain above half the
Men in the Ship had been made unea&s;y, and
there remained &s;till &s;ome mi&s;-under&s;tanding of
my De&s;ign, and a Suppo&s;ition of all the frightful
Things the &s;econd Mate had put into their
Heads; and by his Means the Boat&s;wain and
Gunner: As the&s;e three had the principal Ma|nagement
of the Con&s;piracy, and that I had par|don'd
all the re&s;t, I had &s;ome Thoughts of
making an Example of the&s;e; I took Care to let
them know it too, in a Manner, that they had no
Room to think it was in je&s;t, but that I intended
to have them all three hang'd; and I kept them
above three Weeks in Su&s;pen&s;e about it:
However as I had no Intention to put them
to Death, I thought it was a Piece of Cruelty
&s;omething wor&s;e than Death to keep them
continually in Expectation of it, and in a Place
to where they had but little more than Room
to breath.</P>
<P>So having been 17 Days gone from the Cape,
I re&s;olved to relieve them a little; and yet at
the &s;ame Time remove them out of the Way
of doing me any capital Injury, if they &s;hould
have any &s;uch De&s;ign &s;till in their Heads: For
this Purpo&s;e I cau&s;ed them to be removed out
of the Ship into the Brigantine, and there I per|mitted
them to have a little more Liberty than
they had on board the great Ship; and where
two of them entered into another devili&s;h Con|&s;piracy,
as wild and fooli&s;h as ever I heard of,
or as, perhaps, was ever heard of; of which I
&s;hall &s;ay more in its Place.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62">
We were now two Sail in Company, and we
went away from the Cape the third of <HI>Septem|ber,
Anno.</HI> 1714. We found the Brigantine
was an excellent Sea-boat, and could bear the
Weather to a Miracle, and no bad Sailor; &s;he
kept Pace with us on all Occa&s;ions, and in a
Storm we had at <HI>S. S. E.</HI> &s;ome Days after, &s;he
&s;hifted as well as we did in the great Ship, which
made us all in Love with her.</P>
<P>This Storm drove us away to the <HI>North|ward;</HI>
and I once thought we &s;hould have been
driven back to the Cape again; which if it had
happen'd, I believe we &s;hould never have gone
on with the Voyage; for the Men begun to
murmur again, and &s;ay we were bewitch'd, that
we were beaten off fir&s;t from the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI>
that we could never get round there, and
now driven back from the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Africa;</HI> &s;o
that in &s;hort it look'd as if Fate had determined
this Voyage to be pur&s;ued no farther. The
Wind continued and blew exceeding hard; and
in &s;hort, we were driven &s;o far to the <HI>North,</HI>
that we made the <HI>South</HI> Point of the I&s;land of
<HI>Madaga&s;car.</HI></P>
<P>My Pilot knew it to be <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> as &s;oon as
he had a clear View of the Land, and having
beaten &s;o long again&s;t the Sea to no Purpo&s;e,
and being in Want of many Things, we re|&s;olved
to put in; and accordingly made for
Port St. <HI>Agu&s;tive,</HI> on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Side of the I&s;land,
where we came to an Anchor in eleven fathom
Water, and a very good Road.</P>
<P>I could not be without a great many Anxious
Thoughts upon our coming into this I&s;land; for
I knew very well that there were a Gang of
de&s;perate Rogues here, especially on the <HI>Nor|thren</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="63">
Coa&s;t, who had been famous for their
Pyracies; and I did not know but that they
might be either &s;trong enough as Pyrates, to
take us, or Rogues enough to entice a great
many of my Men to run away: So I re&s;olv'd nei|ther
to come near enough the Shore to be &s;ur|prized,
nor to &s;uffer any of my Men to go on
&s;hore, &s;uch excepted as I could be very &s;ecure
of.</P>
<P>But I was &s;oon inform'd by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man who
came off to me with &s;ome of the Natives in a
kind of Canvas Boat, that there were no <HI>Euro|peans</HI>
there but him&s;elf, and the Pyrates were on
the <HI>North</HI> Part of the I&s;land; that they had no
Ship with them of any Force, and that they
would be glad to be fetch'd off by any Chri|&s;tian
Ship; that they were not above 200 in
Number, their chief Leaders, with the only
Ships of Force they had, being out a Crui&s;ing
on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the Gulph of
<HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>After this, I went on Shore my &s;elf with
Captain <HI>Merlotte,</HI> and &s;ome of the Men who
I could tru&s;t; and we found it true as the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Man had related. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Man gave
us a long Hi&s;tory of his Adventures, and
how he came to be left there by a Ship he came
in from <HI>Europe,</HI> which, he running up into the
Country for Sport, with three more of his Com|rades
went away without them, and left them
among the Natives, who however u&s;ed them
very well, and that now he &s;erv'd them for
an Interpreter and a Broker, to bargain for
them with the <HI>European</HI> Ships for Provi&s;ions.
Accordingly he engag'd to bring us what Pro|vi&s;ions
we pleas'd, and propos'd, &s;uch Trinkets
<PB N="61" REF="64">
in Return, as he knew the Natives de&s;ir'd, and
as were of Value little enough to us, but he
de&s;ir'd a Con&s;ideration for him&s;elf in Money,
which tho' it was of no u&s;e to him there, he
&s;aid, It might be hereafter; and as his De|mand
was but 20 Pieces of Eight, we thought
he very well de&s;erv'd it.</P>
<P>Here we bought a great Quantity of Beef,
which having no Casks to &s;pare, we &s;alted,
and then cur'd it in the Sun by the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Man's Direction, and it prov'd of excellent
U&s;e to us thro' the whole Voyage, for we
kept &s;ome of it, till we came to <HI>England,</HI>
but it was then &s;o hard, that a good Hatch|et
would hardly cut it.</P>
<P>While we lay here, it came into my
Thoughts, that now was a good Time to
execute Ju&s;tice upon my Pri&s;oners, &s;o I call'd
up the Officers to a Kind of Council of War,
and propo&s;ed it to them in general Terms,
not letting them know my Mind, as to the
Manner of it. They all agreed that it was
nece&s;&s;ary, and the &s;econd Mate, Boat&s;wain and
Gunner, had &s;o much Intelligence of it from
the Men, that they prepar'd for Death, as
much as if I had &s;ign'd a Dead Warrant for
their Execution, and that they were to be
hang'd at the Yard Arm. But in the Middle
of tho&s;e Re&s;olves, I told the Council of Offi|cers,
my De&s;ign was, to the <HI>North</HI> Part of
the I&s;land, where a Gang of Pyrates were
&s;aid to be &s;ettled, and that I was per&s;waded
I might get a good Ship among them, and
as many Men as we de&s;ir'd, for that I was
&s;atisfied the greate&s;t Part of them were &s;o
wearied of their pre&s;ent Government, that they
<PB N="62" REF="65">
would be glad of an Opportunity to come
away, and e&s;pecially &s;uch as had either by
Force, or ra&s;h ha&s;ty Re&s;olutions been as it
were &s;urpriz'd into that &s;ort of Life; that I
had been inform'd they were very far from
being in &s;uch a formidable Po&s;ture, as they
had been repre&s;ented to us in <HI>Europe,</HI> or any
thing near &s;o Numerous, but that on the
contrary we &s;hould find them poor, divided,
in Di&s;tre&s;s, and willing to get away upon any
Terms they could.</P>
<P>Some of the Officers of the Ship differ'd
from me in my Opinion; they had received
&s;uch Ideas of the Figure tho&s;e People made
in <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> from the common Report in
<HI>England,</HI> that they had no Notion of them, but
as of a little Common Wealth of Robbers; that
they were immen&s;ely rich, that Captain <HI>Avery</HI>
was King of the I&s;land, that they were near
8000 Men, that they had a good Squadron
of &s;tout Ships, and that they were able to
re&s;i&s;t a whole Fleet of Men of War, having
a Harbour &s;o well fortified at the Entrance
into it, that there was no coming at them
without a good Army for Land Service, and
the like.</P>
<P>I convinc'd them how impo&s;&s;ible this was
to be true, and told them $all the Di&s;cour&s;e
I had had with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man, at the Place
where I now was, who had had a full Account
of it from &s;everal of them, who had come
down to St. <HI>Augu&s;tines</HI> in little Boats, in order
to make their E&s;cape from them, and to get
Pa&s;&s;age for <HI>Europe;</HI> whom he had always a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed,
and got them off, as any Ship touch at
that Port; and who all agreed in their Relati|on
<PB N="63" REF="66">
on of their Particulars, which were indeed mi&s;e|rable
enough, &s;aving that they wanted neither
Victuals or Clothes.</P>
<P>In a Word, I &s;oon brought them to enter
into the Rea&s;on of it, and to be of my Opi|nion,
and accordingly I ordered to get ready,
and in 3 days Time weigh'd, and &s;tood away
for the <HI>North</HI> of the I&s;land; for by the Way
we did not now communicate our Debates or
Re&s;olves to the Men before the Ma&s;t, as had
been done defore, we had indeed had enough
of that already.</P>
<P>While we were thus coa&s;ting the I&s;land, to
the <HI>North</HI> and in the Channel or Sea between
the I&s;land and the Main of <HI>Africa,</HI> it came
into my Thoughts, that I might now make
U&s;e of my Traytors to my Advantage and
their Own too, and that I might if they were
hone&s;t gain my End, and get a full Intelli|gence
of the People I had my Eye upon, and
if they were &s;till Traytors they would de&s;ert
and go over to the Pyrates, and I &s;hould be
well rid of them, without the Nece&s;&s;ity of
bringing them to the Yard Arm; for I was
very unea&s;y in my Mind about hanging them
too, nor could I ever have been brought to
do it, I believe, whatever Ri&s;que I had run
from their mutinous Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>I was now got in the Latitude of 15 De|grees
and a half, <HI>South</HI> of the Lin$, and began
to think of &s;tanding in for the Shore; when
I ordered the &s;econd Mate who lay in Irons in
the Brigantine, to be brought on Board the
great Ship, and to be call'd up into the great
Cabin. He came in great Concern, tho' he was
of him&s;elf a very bold and re&s;olute Fellow, yet
<PB N="64" REF="67">
as he made no doubt, that he was &s;ent for
to Execution, he appear'd throughly &s;often'd,
and quite another Man, than he was before.</P>
<P>When he was brought in, I cau&s;ed him to be
&s;et down in a Nook of the Cabbin, where he
could not &s;tir to offer any Violence to me, if he
had had any Will to it, two large Che&s;ts being
ju&s;t before him; and I order'd all my People to
withdraw, except Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> and the <HI>Supra
Cargo;</HI> and then turning my &s;elf to the Criminal,
I told him he knew his Circum&s;tances, I need not
repeat them, and the Fact for which he was
brought into that Condition; that I had hitherto
from time to time delay'd his Execution, con|trary
to the Opinion of the re&s;t of the chief Offi|cers,
who in full Council had unanimou&s;ly con|demn'd
him; that I had a &s;udden Thought came
into my Head, which, if he knew how to merit
Mercy, and to retrieve his Circum&s;tances by his
future Fidelity, might once again put it into his
Power, not only to &s;ave his Life, but to be tru&s;t|ed
in the Ship again, if he inclined to be hone&s;t;
that however if he had no Inclination to merit by
his Service, I would put it to his Choice, either
to undertake with Courage and Fidelity what I
had to propo&s;e to him, in which Ca&s;e he might
expect to be very well treated, or if not, I would
pardon him as to the Death he had Rea&s;on to
expect, and he, with his two Fellow Criminals,
&s;hould be &s;et on Shore to go whither they pleas'd.</P>
<P>He waited, without offering to &s;peak a Word,
till I made a full Stop, and then ask'd me if I
gave him Leave to an&s;wer; I told him yes; then
he ask'd if I gave him Leave to &s;peak freely, and
would not take Offence at what he might &s;ay; I
told him he &s;hould &s;peak as freely as if he had
<PB N="65" REF="68">
never offended; and that as I had given him his
Life, I now would give him my Word nothing
he could &s;ay &s;hould revoke the Grant; and
that he &s;hould not only go freely on Shore,
<HI>for I expected by his Words that he had made that
Choice,</HI> but that I would give him the the Lives
of his two fellow Pri&s;oners; and would give
them Arms and Ammunition, and any Thing
el&s;e that was rea&s;onable for them to ask, or
nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on Shore in &s;uch a
Country.</P>
<P>He told me then, that, had it been any other
Part of the World than at <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> he would
readily have cho&s;en to have gone on Shore; nay,
tho' the Place had been really de&s;olate and un|inhabited;
that he did not object becau&s;e my Offer
was not very generous and kind, and it would
be always with regret that he &s;hould look back
upon the Mercy he &s;hould have received, and
how ill he had de&s;erv'd it at my Hands.</P>
<P>But that, as it was at this Place that I men|tioned
&s;etting him at Liberty, he told me, that tho'
he had been mutinous and di&s;orderly, for which
he acknowledg'd he had de&s;erv'd to die, yet he
hop'd I could not think &s;o ill of him as to believe he
could turn Pyrate; and begg'd that rather than
entertain &s;uch hard Thoughts of him, I would
execute the wor&s;t Part of the Sentence and
&s;end him out of the World a Penitent, and an
hone&s;t Man; which he &s;hould e&s;teem far better
than to give him his Life in a Condition in
which he could pre&s;erve it upon no other Terms
than tho&s;e of being the wor&s;t of Villains: He
added, that if there was any Thing he could do
to de&s;erve &s;o much Mercy as I intended him,
he begg'd me that I would give him Room to
<PB N="66" REF="69">
behave him&s;elf as became him, and he would
leave it wholly to me, to u&s;e him as he &s;hould de|&s;erve,
even to the recalling the Pardon that I had
granted him.</P>
<P>I was extremely &s;atisfied with what he &s;aid,
and more particularly with the Manner of his
Speaking it: I told him I was glad to &s;ee that he
had a Principle of &s;o much Hone&s;ty, at the Bot|tom
of a Part &s;o unhappy as he had acted; that
I would be very far from prompting him to
turn Pyrate, and much more from forcing him
to do &s;o; and that I would according to his
De&s;ire put an Opportunity into his Hands to
&s;hew him&s;elf a new Man; and by his Fidelity
to wipe out all that was pa&s;t: And then, with|out
any more Ceremony, I told him my whole
De&s;ign, which was to &s;end him, and four or five
more Men with him, on Shore among the py|rates
as Spies, to &s;ee what Condition they were
in, and to &s;ee whether there was any Apprehen|&s;ions
of Violence from them, or whether they
were in the mean Circum&s;tances that I had Rea|&s;on
to believe they were in; and la&s;tly whether
they had any Ship or Ve&s;&s;el which might be
bought of them, and whether Men might be
had to encrea&s;e our Company; that is to &s;ay,
&s;uch Men as being penitent for their Rogueries,
and tyred with their Mi&s;cries, would be glad of
the Opportunity of turning hone&s;t Men before
they were brought to it by Di&s;tre&s;s and the Gal|lows.</P>
<P>He embraced the Offer with the greate&s;t rea|dine&s;s,
and gave me all the A&s;&s;aurances that I
could de&s;ire of his Fidelity. I then ask'd him
whether he thought his two fellow Pri&s;oners
might be tru&s;ted upon the &s;ame Foot. He ask'd
<PB N="67" REF="70">
me if I would take it for a Piece of Sincerity,
if after a Tryal, he &s;hould tell me his Mind, and
would not be di&s;plea&s;ed if he declined &s;peaking
his Thoughts till he had talk'd with them: I
told him he &s;hould be at Liberty to give his
farther An&s;wer after he had propos'd it to him;
but I in&s;i&s;ted upon his Opinion fir&s;t, becau&s;e
it was only his Opinion that I ask'd now; where|as
if he reported it to them, then he had no
more to do but to report their An&s;wer. He
then ask'd me if I would plea&s;e to grant him
one Thing; (<HI>viz.</HI>) that whatever his Opinion
&s;hould be, that what he &s;hould &s;ay &s;hould be no
Prejudice to them in their pre&s;ent Condition:
I told him it was a rea&s;onable Caution in him,
and I would a&s;&s;ure him, that whatever he &s;aid
&s;hould not do them any Prejudice; and to con|vince
him of it, I gave him my Word that I
would not put them to Death on any Account
what&s;oever merely for his Sake: He bow'd and
thank'd me very heartily for that Grant, which
he &s;aid oblig'd him to be the plainer with me
on that Head; and as he &s;aid, he would not
deceive me in any Thing whatever, &s;o he would
not in this e&s;pecially; and therefore told me, it
was his Opinion they would not &s;erve me faith|fully;
and he referr'd me to the Experience I
&s;hould find of it; and added, that he would be &s;o
ju&s;t to me in the beginning, as that while he
begg'd me to be merciful to them, yet for my
own Sake he would al&s;o beg me not to tru&s;t
them.</P>
<P>I took the Hint, and &s;aid no more at that
Time, but ordered his Irons to be taken off, and
ordred him to have leave to go to his former
Cabbin, and to have his Che&s;ts and Things re|&s;tored
<PB N="68" REF="71">
to him; &s;o that he was at full Liberty
in the Ship, tho' not in any Office, or appoin|ted
to any particular Bu&s;ine&s;s. A Day or two
after this, we made Land, which appear'd to be
the <HI>North We&s;t</HI> Part of the I&s;land, in the Lati|tude
of thirteen Degrees thirty Minutes; and
now I thought it was Time to put our De&s;ign
in Execution; for I knew very well that it
could not be a great Way from this Part of
the I&s;land where the Pyrates were to be heard
of: So I ordered the Boat on Shore, with about
&s;ixteen Men, to make Di&s;coveries, and with them
my new re&s;tored Man. I gave him no In&s;truc|tion
for any thing extraordinary at this Time;
our Work now being only to find out where
they were: The Boat came on board again at
Night, for we had now &s;tood in within two
Leagues of the Shore, and brought us an Ac|count,
that there were no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Europeans</HI>
at all thereabouts, but that they were to be heard
of a great Way farther: So we &s;tood away to
the <HI>North</HI> all the Night, and the next Day, the
Wind being fair and the Sea &s;mooth, and by
our Reckoning we went in that Time about
forty Leagues.</P>
<P>The next Evening, the &s;ame Company went
on Shore again, and were &s;hew'd by &s;ome of
the Natives where the Pyrates inhabited; which
in &s;hort, was about five or &s;ix and twenty Miles
farther <HI>North</HI> &s;till, in a River very commodious for
Shipping, where they had five or &s;ix <HI>European</HI>
built Ships, and two or three Sloops; but they
were all laid up, except two Sloops, with which
they crui&s;ed &s;ometimes a great Di&s;tance off to
the <HI>North,</HI> as far as the <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulph: He
returned with this Intelligence the &s;ame Night;
<PB N="69" REF="72">
and by his Direction, we &s;tood in as clo&s;e un|der
the Shore, as we could conveniently, about
&s;ix Leagues farther <HI>North;</HI> here we found a ve|ry
good Road under a little Cape, which kept
us perfectly undi&s;covered; and in the Morning
before Day, my Man went on Shore again with
the Boat, and keeping only four Men with him,
&s;ent the Boat on board again, agreeing on a
Signal for us to &s;end the Boat for him again
when he &s;hould return.</P>
<P>There was a pretty high Ledge of Hills to
the <HI>North</HI> of the Place where he landed, and
which running <HI>We&s;t</HI> made the little Cape under
the Lee of which our Ship rode at an Anchor
as above. As &s;oon as he came to the top of
tho&s;e Hills he plainly di&s;covered the Creek or
Harbour where the Pyrate Ships lay, and where
they had form'd their Encampment on the Shore.
Our Men took &s;uch proper Ob&s;ervations of the
Scituation of the Place they were in, upon the
Hill, that they might not fail to find their Way
back again, tho' it were in the Night; and ha|ving
agreed in the Account they &s;hould give of
them&s;elves, &s;o that they might be all found in
the &s;ame Tale. They boldly went down the
Hill, and came to the Edge of the Creek; the
Pyrates Camp being on the other Shore.</P>
<P>Here they fir'd a Gun to rai&s;e a kind of Al|larm
among them, and then hanging out a
white Cloth on the top of a Pole, a Signal
of Peace, they Hail'd them in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and ask'd
them if they would &s;end a Boat and fetch them
over.</P>
<P>The Pyrates were &s;urpriz'd at the Noi&s;e of the
Piece, and came running to the Shore with all
&s;peed; but they were much &s;urpriz'd when they
<PB N="70" REF="73">
heard them&s;elves Hail'd in <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Upon the
whole, they immediately &s;ent a Boat to fetch them
over, and received them with a great deal of
Joy.</P>
<P>Our Men pretended to be overjoy'd at finding
them there, told them a long Story, that they
came on Shore on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Side of the I&s;land
where, not far off, there were two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships;
but that the Natives quarrelling with their Men,
upon &s;ome Rudene&s;s offer'd to their Women;
and they being &s;eparated from their Fellows,
were oblig'd to fly, that the Natives had &s;urroun|ded
the re&s;t, and they believ'd had kill'd them all;
that they wandred up to the top of the hill, in|tending
to make Signals to their Ship, to &s;end
them &s;ome Help; when &s;eeing &s;ome Ships, they
believed &s;ome <HI>Europeans</HI> were there, and &s;o came
down to take Shelter; and they begg'd of them
a Boat to carry them round the Cape to their
Comrades; unle&s;s they would give them Leave
to &s;tay with them, and do as they did, which
they were very willing to do.</P>
<P>This was all a made Story; but however, the
Tale told &s;o well, that they believ'd it thorow|ly,
and received our Men very kindly, led them
up to their Camp, and gave them &s;ome Victu|als.</P>
<P>Our Men ob&s;erv'd they had Victuals enough,
and very good, as well Beef as Mutton; that
is to &s;ay, of Goats Fle&s;h, which was excellent
good; al&s;o Pork and Veal, and they were tole|rable
good Cooks too; for they found they had
built &s;everal Furnaces and Boilers, which they
had taken out of their Ships, and dre&s;s'd a va&s;t
Quantity of Meat at a Time: But they ob&s;erv'd
they had no Liquor; upon which, the Mate pull'd
<PB N="71" REF="74">
a large Bottle of good Cordial Waters out
of his Pocket, and gave it about as far as it
would go, and &s;o did two others of the Men
which their new Landlords took very kind|ly.</P>
<P>They &s;pent good Part of the fir&s;t Day in look|ing
about them, &s;eeing the Manner of the Py|rates
Living there, and their Strength; and &s;oon
perceived that they were indeed but in a &s;orry
Condition every Way, except that they had Cat|tle
and Fle&s;h Meat &s;ufficient. They had a good
Platform of Guns indeed, and a covered Place
palli&s;ado'd round where they lodg'd their Am|munition.
But as for Fortifications to the Land|ward
they had none, except a double Palli&s;ado
round their Camp, and a &s;ort of a Bank thrown
up within to fire from, and &s;tand covered from
the Enemies Lances, which was all they had to
fear from the Natives. They had no Bread but
what they made of Rice, and the Store they had
of that was very &s;mall: They told our Men in|deed,
that they had two Ships Abroad, who they
expected back every Day with a Quantity of
Rice, and what el&s;e they could get; e&s;pecially
with &s;ome Arack, which they were to Trade for
with the <HI>Arabian</HI> Merchants, or take it by
Force, which &s;hould fir&s;t offer.</P>
<P>Our Men pretended to like their Way of
living mighty well, and talk'd of &s;taying with
them, if they would let them, and thus they
pa&s;s'd the fir&s;t Day of Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Our Men had two Tents or Hutts given them
to lodge in, and Hammocks hung in the Hutts
very agreeably, being &s;uch I &s;uppo&s;e as be|long'd
to &s;ome of their Company that were
dead, or were out upon Adventure, here they
<PB N="72" REF="75">
&s;lept very &s;ecure, and in the Morning walk'd
about, as Strangers might be &s;uffer'd to do to
look about them, but my new Manager's Eye
was chiefly here upon two Things, <HI>1&s;t.</HI> to &s;ee
if they had any Shipping for our Purpo&s;e, and
<HI>2ly.</HI> to &s;ee, if he could pitch upon one Man
more particular than the re&s;t, to enter into
&s;ome Confidence with, and it was not long
before he found an Opportunity for both, the
Manner was thus;</P>
<P>He was walking by him&s;elf, having ordered
his other Men to &s;traggle away, two and two,
this way and that, as if they had not minded
him, tho' always to keep him in Sight, I &s;ay,
he walk'd by him&s;elf towards that Part of the
Creek, where, as was &s;aid, three of their big|e&s;t
Ships lay by the Walls, and when he came
to the Shore right again&s;t them, he &s;tood &s;till
looking at them very earne&s;tly, while he was
here, he ob&s;ev'd a Boat put off from One of
them, with four Oars and one Sitter onely,
who they &s;et on &s;hore ju&s;t by him, and then
put off again; the Per&s;on, who they &s;et on
&s;hore, was it &s;eems, One, who had been with|our
Men the evening before, but having &s;ome
particular Office on board one of tho&s;e Ships,
lay on board every Night with about 10 or 12
Men, ju&s;t to watch and guard the Ship, and
&s;o came on Shore in the Morning, as is u&s;ual
in Men of War lay'd up.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he &s;aw our Man, he knew him,
and &s;poke very familiarly to him, and &s;eeing
he was looking &s;o earne&s;tly at the Ship, he
ask'd him, if he would go on board, our Man
faintly declin'd it, as on purpo&s;e to be ask'd
again, and upon ju&s;t as much farther pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="73" REF="76">
as was &s;ufficient to &s;atisfie him, that the Gun|ner,
for that was his Office, was in earne&s;t,
he yeilded, &s;o the Gunner call'd back the
Boat, and they went on board.</P>
<P>Our Man view'd the Ship very particularly,
and pretended to like eve$ry Thing he &s;aw,
but, after &s;ome Conver&s;ation, asks him this
home Que&s;tion, namely, why they did not go
to Sea, and &s;eek Purcha&s;e, having &s;o many
good Ships at their Command; he &s;hook his
Head, and told him very frankly, that they
were in no Condition to undertake any thing,
for that they were a Crew of unre&s;olv'd divi|ded
Rogues; that they were never two Days
of a Mind, that they had no Body to com|mand,
and therefore no Body to obey; that
&s;everal Things had been offer'd, but nothing
concluded, that in &s;hort they thought of no|thing,
but of &s;hifting every one for them|&s;elves,
as well as they could.</P>
<P>My Mate reply'd, he thought it had been quite
otherwi&s;e, and that made him tell them la&s;t
Night, that he had an Inclination to &s;tay with
them; I heard you &s;ay &s;o, &s;aid the Gunner, and
it made me &s;mile; I thought in my &s;elf, that
you would be of another Mind, when you
knew us a little better, for in a Word &s;aid
he, if they &s;hould agree to lend you a Boat
to go back to your Ship, they would go toge|ther
by the Ears, about who &s;hould go with
you, for not a Man of them, that went with
you, would ever come back again hither, if
your Captain would take them on board, tho'
the Terms were to be hang'd, when they
came to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77">
My Mate knew that this was my Opinion
before, but he was realy of another Mind him|&s;elf,
till he &s;aw things, and till he talk'd with
this Gunner, and this put new Things in his
Head; &s;o he entertain'd the Gunner with a
Scheme of his own, and told him, if it was &s;o
as he related it, and that he had really a mind
to come off from that Gang, he believ'd, that
he could put him in a way how to do it to
his Advantage, and to take a Set of his People
with him, if he could pick out &s;ome of them
that might be depended upon.</P>
<P>The Gunner reply'd, that he could pick out
a Set of very brave Fellows, good Seamen,
and mo&s;t of them &s;uch, as having been forc'd
into the Pyrates Ships, were drag'd into that
wicked Life they had lived, not onely again&s;t
their Con&s;ciences, but by a meer Nece&s;&s;ity to &s;ave
their Lives, and that they would be glad at
any Price to come off: The Mate ask'd him,
how many &s;uch he could an&s;wer for, he told
him above a hundred; upon this the Mate
told him the Circum&s;tances we were in, the
Voyage we were upon, that we were a Letter
of <HI>Mart</HI> Ship of &s;uch a Force, but that we
were over mann'd and double &s;tor'd, in hopes
of getting a good Ship upon our Crui&s;e, to
man out of the other, that we had been di&s;|appointed,
and had only got the Sloop or
Brigantine which we bought, as before, at the
Cape, that if he could per&s;wade the Men, to
&s;ell us one of their Ships, we would pay them
for it in ready Money, and perhaps entertain
100 of their Men into the Bargain.</P>
<P>The Gunner told him, he would propo&s;e it:
to them, and added in po&s;itive Terms, that
<PB N="75" REF="78">
he knew it would be readily accepted, and
that he &s;hould take which of the three Ships
I pleas'd; the Mate then de&s;ir'd, that he would
lend them his Shallop to go on board our Ship,
to acquaint me with it, and bring back &s;uffici|ent
Orders to treat; he told him, he would
not only do that, but before I could be ready
to go, he would propo&s;e it to the chief Men
that he had his Eye upon, and would have
their Con&s;ent, and that then he would go a|long
with him on board to make a Bargain.</P>
<P>This was as well as our Mate could expect,
and the Gunner had either &s;o much Authority
among them, or the Men were &s;o forward to
&s;hift their Station in the World, that the
Gunner came again to our Mate in le&s;s than
two hours, with an Order, &s;ign'd by about
&s;ixteen of their Officers, empowering him to
&s;ell us the Ship, which the Gunner was on
board of, and to allot &s;o many Guns, and
&s;uch a Proportion of Ammunition to her, as
was &s;ufficient, and to give the Work of all
their Carpenters for &s;o many Days, as were
nece&s;&s;ary to repair her, Calk, and grave her,
and put her in Condition to go to Sea.</P>
<P>She was a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> built Ship, where they had
her, the Gunner &s;aid he did not know; but
&s;he was a very &s;trong tight Ship, and a pretty
good Sailor. We made her carry two and thirty
Guns, tho' &s;he had not been u&s;ed to carry above
twenty-four.</P>
<P>The Gunner being thus impower'd to treat
with my Mate, came away in their Shallop, and
brought the &s;aid Gunner and and two more of
their Officers with him and eight Seamen.
The Gunner and I &s;oon made a Bargain for the
<PB N="76" REF="79">
Ship, which I bought for five thou&s;and Pieces
of Eight, mo&s;t of it in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods, &s;uch as
they wanted; for they were many of them al|mo&s;t
naked of Clothes; and as for other Things
they had &s;carce a pair of Stockings or Shoes a|mong
them. When our Bargain was made, and
the Mate had related all the Particulars of the
Conference he had had with the Gunner, we
came to talk of the People who were to go with
us: The Gunner told us that we might in|deed
have good Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect a Gang of
Men who had made them&s;elves infamous all over
the World by &s;o many Pyracies and wicked Ac|tions:
But if I would put &s;o much Confidence
in him, he would a&s;&s;ure me, that as he &s;hould
have the Power in his Hands to pick and chu&s;e
his Men, &s;o he would an&s;wer Body for Body for
the Fidelity of all the Men he &s;hould chu&s;e;
and that mo&s;t, if not all of them, would be
&s;uch as had been taken by Force out of other
Ships, or wheedl'd away when they were drunk:
And in a Word, he told me, there never was a
Ship-load of &s;uch Penitents went to Sea toge|ther
as he would bring us: when he had &s;aid &s;o,
he began to move me that I would plea&s;e to give
him the &s;ame Po&s;t which he held in the Ship;
(<HI>viz.</HI>) of Gunner, which I promi&s;ed him; and
then he de&s;ir'd I would permit him to &s;peak
with me in Private; I was not at fir&s;t very
free to it, but he having con&s;ented to let the
Mate and Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> be pre&s;ent, I yield|ed.</P>
<P>When all the re&s;t were withdrawn, he told
me, that having been five Years in the Pyrates
Service, as he might call it, and being obliged to
do as they did, I might be &s;ure he had &s;ome &s;mall
<PB N="77" REF="80">
Share in the Purcha&s;e; and however, he had
come into it again&s;t his Will, yet as he had been
oblig'd to go with them, he had made &s;ome Ad|vantage;
and that being re&s;olv'd to leave them,
he had a good while ago pack'd up &s;ome of the
be&s;t of what he had got, to make his E&s;cape,
and begg'd I would let him depo&s;ite it with me
as a Security for his Fidelity. Upon this, he or|der'd
a Che&s;t to be taken out of the Shallop, and
brought into my great Cabbin; and be&s;ides this,
gave me out of his Pocket, a Bag &s;eal'd up, the
Contents of which, I &s;hall &s;peak of hereafter.</P>
<P>The Shallop return'd the next Day, and I &s;ent
back the Mate with my Long Boat and twenty
four Men, to go and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ship,
and appointed my Carpenter to go and &s;ee to the
Repairs that were nece&s;&s;ary to be done to her:
And &s;ome Days after, I &s;ent Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> with
the <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> in our Sloop, to go and &s;ecure
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to cover the Retreat of any
of the Men that might have a Mind to come
away, and might be oppos'd by the re&s;t: And
this was done at the Reque&s;t of the Gunner, who
fore&s;aw there might be &s;ome Squabble about it.</P>
<P>They &s;pent &s;ix Weeks and &s;ome odd Days in
&s;itting out this Ship, occa&s;ioned by the want of
a convenient place to lay her on Shore in, which
they were oblig'd to make with a great deal of
Labour, however, &s;he was compleatly &s;itted up:
When &s;he was &s;itted, they laid in a good
Store of Provi&s;ions, tho' not &s;o well cur'd as to
la&s;t a great while; One of the be&s;t Things we
got a Recruit of here, was Casks, which <HI>as be|fore</HI>
we greatly wanted, and which their Coopers
a&s;&s;i&s;ted us to trim, &s;ea&s;on, and &s;it up.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="81">
As to Bread, we had no Help from them
for they not only had none but what they made
of Rice, but they had no &s;ufficient Store of that,
as I have hinted before.</P>
<P>But we had more to do yet: For when the
Ship was &s;itted up, and our Men had the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of her, they were &s;urpriz'd one Morning
on a &s;udden, with a mo&s;t horrible Tumult among
the Pyrates; and had not our Brigantine been at
hand, (as above) to &s;ecure the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I believe
they had taken the Ship from our Men again, and
perhaps have came down with her and their two
Sloops, and have attack'd us. The Ca&s;e was
this,</P>
<P>The Gunner, who was a punctual Fellow to
his Word, re&s;olv'd that none of the Men &s;hould
go in the Ship, but &s;uch as he had &s;ingl'd out;
and they were &s;uch, as were generally Men taken
out of Merchants Ships, by Force, as before:
But when he came to talk to the Men of who
and who &s;hould go, and &s;tay; truly they wou'd
all go, to a Man, there was not a Man of them
wou'd &s;tay behind; and, in a Word, they fell
out about it, to that Degree, that they came to
Blows, and the Gunner was forced to fly for it,
with about twenty two Men that &s;tood to him,
and &s;ix or &s;even were wounded in the Fray,
whereof two died.</P>
<P>The Gunner being thus driven to his Shifts,
made down to the Shore to his Boat, but the
Rogues were too nimble for him, and had got to
his Boat before him, and prepar'd to man her
and two more, to go on Board and &s;ecure the
Ship: In this Di&s;tre&s;s, the Gunner, who had ta|ken
Sanctuary in the Woods at about a Mile di|&s;tance,
but unhappily above the Camp, &s;o that
<PB N="79" REF="82">
the Platform of Guns was between him and the
Ship, had no Remedy, but to &s;end one of his Men
who &s;wam very well, to take a Compa&s;s round
behind the Pyrates Camp, and come to the Wa|ter
&s;ide below the Camp and Platform, &s;o to take
the Water and &s;wim on Board the Ship, which
lay near a League below their &s;aid Camp, and give
our Men Notice of what had happened, to warn
them to &s;uffer none of their Men to come on
Board, unle&s;s the Gunner was with them, and if
po&s;&s;ible, to &s;end a Boat on Shore to fetch off the
Gunner and his Men, who were following by the
&s;ame way, and would be at the &s;ame place, and
make a Signal to them to come for him.</P>
<P>Our Men had &s;carce receiv'd this Notice, when
they &s;aw a Boat full of Men put off from the
Platform, and row down under Shore towards
them: But as they re&s;olv'd not to &s;uffer them to
come on Board, they call'd to them by a Speak|ing
Trumpet, and told them they might go back
again, for they &s;hould not come on Board, nor
any other Boat, unle&s;s the Gunner was on Board.</P>
<P>They row'd on for all that, when our Men
call'd to them again, and told them, if they of|fer'd
to put off, in order to come on Board, or in
&s;hort, to row down Shore any farther than a lit|tle
Point which our Man nam'd, and which was
ju&s;t a head of them, they would fire at them:
Well, they row'd on for all this, and that tho'
they were pa&s;t the Point; which our Men &s;eeing,
they immediately let fly a Shot, but fir'd a little
a head of them, &s;o as not to hit the Boat, and
this brought them to a &s;top; &s;o they lay upon
their Oars a while, as if they were con&s;idering
what to do; when our Men perceiv'd two Boats
more come off from the Platform likewi&s;e, full
<PB N="80" REF="83">
of Men, and rowing after the fir&s;t. Upon this,
they call'd again to the fir&s;t Boat with their
Speaking Trumpet, and told them if they did
not all go immediately on Shore, they would
&s;ink the Boat. They had no Remedy, &s;eeing our
Men re&s;olv'd, and that they lay open to the
Shot of the Ship; &s;o they went on Shore accor|dingly,
and then our Men fir'd at the empty Boat,
till they &s;plit her in Pieces, and made her u&s;ele&s;s
to them.</P>
<P>Upon this firing, our Brigantine, which lay
about two Leagues off in the Mouth of a little
Creek, on the <HI>South</HI> of that River, weigh'd im|mediately,
and &s;tood away to the opening of the
Road where the Ship lay, and the Tide of Flood
being &s;till running in, they drove up towards
the Ship for her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and came to an An|chor
about a Cables Length a head of her, but
within Pi&s;tol &s;hot of the Shore; at the &s;ame time
&s;ending two and thirty of her Men on Board the
great Ship to re-inforce the Men on Board, who
were but &s;ixteen in Number.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this time, the Gunner and his twenty
one Men, who heard the firing, and had quick|ened
their Pace, tho' they had a great Compa&s;s
to fetch, thro' Woods and untrod Raths, and
&s;ome Luggage to carry too, were come to the
Shore, and made the Signal, which our Men in
the Ship ob&s;erving, gave Notice to the Officer of
the Brigantine to fetch them on Board, which he
did very &s;afely; by the way, as the Officer after|wards
told us, mo&s;t of their Luggage con&s;i&s;ted
in Money, with which it &s;eems every Man of
them was very well furni&s;h'd, having &s;hared their
Wealth at their fir&s;t coming on Shore: As for
Clothes, they had very few, and tho&s;e all in
<PB N="81" REF="84">
Rags; and as for Linnen, they had &s;carce a Shirt
among them all, or Linnen enough to have made
a white Flag for a Truce, if they had had Occa|&s;ion
for it: In &s;hort, a Crew &s;o rich and &s;o rag|ged,
were hardly ever &s;een before.</P>
<P>The Ship was now pretty well mann'd, for the
Brigantine carried the Gunner and his twenty one
Men on Board her; and the Tide by this time
being &s;pent, &s;he immediately unmoor'd, and
loos'd her Top Sails, <HI>which, as it happen'd, had
been bent to the Yards two Days before,</HI> &s;o with
the fir&s;t of the Ebb, &s;he weigh'd and fell down
about a League farther, by which &s;he was quite
out of Reach of the Platform, and rid in the open
Sea; and the Brigantine did the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But by this Means, they mi&s;s'd the Occa&s;ion of
the re&s;t of the Gunner's Men, who having got
together to the Number of between &s;eventy and
eighty, had follow'd him and come down to the
Shore, and made the Signals, but were not un|der&s;tood
by our Ship, which put the poor Men
to great Difficulties; for they had broken away
from the re&s;t by Force, and had been pur&s;ued
half a Mile by the whole Body, and particularly
at the Entrance into a very thick, woody place,
were &s;o hard put to it, that they were oblig'd to
make a de&s;perate &s;tand, and fire at their old
Friends, which had exa&s;perated them to the la&s;t
Degree. But as the Ca&s;e of the&s;e Men was de&s;|perate,
they took an effectual Method for their
own Security, of which I &s;hall give a farther Ac|count
pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The general Body of the Pyrates were now up
in Arms, and the new Ship was, as it were, in open
War with them, or at lea&s;t they had declar'd War
again&s;t it: But as they had been di&s;appointed
<PB N="82" REF="85">
in their Attempt to force it, and found they were
not &s;trong enough at Sea to attack it, they &s;ent
a Flag of Truce on Board. Our Men admit|ted
them to come to the Ship &s;ide, but as my
Mate, who now had the Command, knew them
to be a Gang of de&s;perate Rogues that would at|tempt
any thing, tho' never &s;o ra&s;h, he order'd
that none of them &s;hould come on Board the
Ship, except the Officer and two more, who
gave an Account that they were &s;ent to treat
with us. So we call'd them the Amba&s;&s;adors.</P>
<P>When they came on Board, they expo&s;tulated
very warmly with my new Agent the &s;econd
Mate, that our Men came in the Po&s;ture of
Friends, and of Friends too in Di&s;tre&s;s, and had
receiv'd Favours from them, but had abu&s;ed the
Kindne&s;s, which had been &s;hewn them; that they
had bought a Ship of them, and had had Leave and
A&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;it her up and furni&s;h her; but had
not paid for her, or paid for what A&s;&s;i&s;tance and
what Provi&s;ions had been given to them: And
that now to compleat all, their Men had been
partially and unfairly treated, and when a cer|tain
Number of Men had been granted us, an in|ferior
Fellow a Gunner was &s;et to call &s;uch and
&s;uch Men out, ju&s;t who he plea&s;ed, to go with
us; whereas the whole Body ought to have had
the appointing who they wou'd or wou'd not give
Leave to, to go in the Ship: That when they
came in a peaceable manner to have demanded
Ju&s;tice, and to have treated amicably of the&s;e
Things, our Men had denied them Admittance,
had committed Ho&s;tilities again&s;t them, had fir'd
at their Men and &s;tav'd their Boat, and had af|terward
receiv'd on Board their De&s;erters, all
<PB N="83" REF="86">
contrary to the Rules of Friend&s;hip. And in all
the&s;e Ca&s;es they demanded Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Our new Commander was a ready Man
enough, and he an&s;wer'd all their Complaints
with a great deal of Gravity and Calmne&s;s: He
told them, that it was true we came to them as
Friends, and had receiv'd friendly U&s;age from
them, which we had not in the lea&s;t di&s;honour'd;
but that as Friends in Di&s;tre&s;s, we had never
pretended to be, and really were not; for that
we were neither in Danger of any thing, or in
Want of any thing; that as to Provi&s;ions, we
were &s;trong enough, if need were, to procure
our &s;elves Provi&s;ions in any part of the I&s;land, and
had been &s;everal times &s;upplied from the Shore
by the Natives, for which we had always fully
&s;atisfied the People who furni&s;h'd us; and that
we &s;corn'd to be ungrateful for any Favour we
&s;hould have receiv'd, much le&s;s to abu&s;e it, or
them for it.</P>
<P>That we had paid the full Price of all the Pro|vi&s;ions
we had receiv'd, and for the Work that
had been done to the Ship, that what we had bar|gain'd
for, as the Price of the Ship, had been paid,
as far as the Agreement made it due, and that
what remain'd, was ready to be paid as &s;oon as
the Ship was fini&s;hed, which was our Bargain.</P>
<P>That as to the People who were willing to take
Service with us, and enter them&s;elves on Board,
it is true, that the Gunner and &s;ome other Men
offered them&s;elves to us, and we had accepted
of them, and we thought it was our part to ac|cept
or not to accept of &s;uch Men as we thought
fit. As for what was among them&s;elves, that
we had nothing to do with; that if we had been
publickly warn'd by them not to have entertain'd
<PB N="84" REF="87">
any of their Men, but with Con&s;ent of the whole
Body, then indeed we &s;hould have had Rea&s;on
to be cautious; otherwi&s;e, we were not in the
lea&s;t concern'd about it. That it is true, we re|fu&s;ed
to let their Boats come on Board us, being
a&s;&s;ured that they came in a ho&s;tile manner, either
to take away the Men by Force, which had been
entred in our Service, or perhaps even to &s;eize
the Ship it &s;elf; and why el&s;e was the fir&s;t Boat
follow'd by two more full of Men, arm'd and
prepar'd to attack us; that we not only came in
a friendly manner to them, but re&s;olv'd to con|tinue
in Friend&s;hip with them, if they thought
fit to u&s;e us as Friends; but that con&s;idering
what part of the World we were in, and what
their Circum&s;tances were, they mu&s;t allow us to
be upon our Guard, and not put our &s;elves in a
Condition to be u&s;ed ill.</P>
<P>While he was talking thus with them in
the Cabbin, he had ordered a Can of Flip to
be made, and given their Men in the Boat,
and every one a Dram of the Bottle, but
would not &s;uffer them to come on board; how|ever
one or two of them got leave to get in at
one of the Ports, and got between Decks among
our Men; here they made terrible Complaints
of their Condition, and begg'd hard to be enter|tain'd
in our Service; they were full of Money,
and gave twenty or thirty Pieces of Eight a|mong
our Men, and by this Pre&s;ent pre|vail'd
for two Men to &s;peak to my Mate,
who appear'd as Captain to take the Boat's
Crew on board; the Mate very gravely told
the two Amba&s;&s;adors of it, and told them,
that &s;eeing they were come with a Flag of
Truce, he would not &s;top their Men, without
<PB N="85" REF="88">
their Con&s;ent, but the Men being &s;o earne&s;t, he
thought, they would do better not to oppo&s;e
them; the Amba&s;&s;adors, as I call them, oppo&s;'d
it however vehemently, and at la&s;t de&s;ir'd to go
and talk with the Men, which was granted them
readily; When they came into their Boat,
their Men told them plainly, that <HI>One and all</HI>
they would enter them&s;elves with their Country
Men, that they had been forc'd already to turn
Pyrates, and they thought, they might very ju&s;t|ly
turn hone&s;t Men again by Force, if they
could not get Leave to do it peaceably; and that
in &s;hort, they would go on Shore no more; that
if the Amba&s;&s;adors de&s;ir'd it, they would &s;et
them on Shore with the Boat, but as for them|&s;elves,
they would go along with the new Cap|tain.</P>
<P>When the Amba&s;&s;adors &s;aw this, they had no
more to do, but to be &s;atisfied, and &s;o were &s;et
on Shore, where they de&s;ir'd, and their Men
&s;taid on Board.</P>
<P>During this Tran&s;action, my Mate had &s;ent
a full Account to me of all that had pa&s;s'd, and
had de&s;ir'd me to come on board, and give far|ther
Directions in all that was to come; &s;o I took
our <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> and Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> along with
me, and &s;ome more of our Officers, and went to
them; it was my Lot to come on board, ju&s;t
when tho&s;e famous Amba&s;&s;adors were talking
with my Mate, &s;o I heard mo&s;t of what they had to
&s;ay, and heard the An&s;wer my Mate gave them,
as above, which was extremely to my Satisfacti|on;
nor did I interrupt him, or take upon me
hny Authority, tho' he would very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively
aave had me &s;hewn my &s;elf, as Captain, but I
<PB N="86" REF="89">
bid him go on, and &s;at down, as not concern'd it
the Affair at all.</P>
<P>After the Amba&s;&s;adors were gone, the fir&s;t
thing I did, was, in the Pre&s;ence of all the Com|pany,
and having before had the Opinion of tho&s;e
I brought with me, to tell my &s;econd Mate, how
well we were all &s;atisfi'd with his Conduct, and to
declare him, Captain of the Ship, that he was
in; only demanding his &s;olemn Oath, to be under
Orders of the great Ship, as Admiral; and to
carry on no &s;eparate Intere&s;t from us, which h$e
thankfully accepted, and to give him his Due, a$
faithfully perform'd, all the re&s;t of our very long
Voyage, and thro' all our Adventures.</P>
<P>It was upon my &s;eeming Interce&s;&s;ion, that h$
gave Con&s;ent to the Boat's Crew, who brough
the Amba&s;&s;adors, to remain in our Service, and
&s;et their State&s;men on &s;hore; and in fine, I told
him, that as far as about one hundred and fifty
or two hundred Men, he &s;hould entertain wh$o
he thought fit; thus having &s;ettl'd all things it
the Ship to our Satisfaction, we went back to
our great Ship the next day.</P>
<P>I had not been many hours on board our Ship
but I was &s;urprz'd with the fireing of three Mu&s;|quets
from the Shore; we wondred what &s;hould
be the meaning of it, knowing, that it was at
unu&s;ual Thing in that Place, where we knew th$
<HI>Natives</HI> of the Country had no Fire-Arms, &s;o we
knew not what to make of it, and therefor$
took no Notice of it, other than as I &s;ay, to won|der
at it; about half an hour after that, we hear|d
three Mu&s;quets more, and &s;till not knowing any|thing
of the Matter, we made them no Return
to the Signal; &s;ome Time after, three Muskets
were fir'd again, but all was one, we took n$
<PB N="87" REF="90">
Notice, for we knew nothing, of what Return
was to be made to it.</P>
<P>When Night came on, we ob&s;erv'd two great
Fires upon two &s;everal Hills, on that Part of the
Shore, oppo&s;ite to us, and after that, three Rock|ets
were fir'd, &s;uch as they were, but they went
off ill; I &s;uppo&s;e their Gunner was ill provided
for &s;uch Things, but all &s;ignified nothing; we
would ha' made any Return to them, that had
been to be under&s;tood, but we knew nothing of
any agreed Signal; however I re&s;olv'd, that
in the Morning I would &s;end a Boat on Shore,
well mann'd, to learn if po&s;&s;ible, what the Mean|ing
of all this was; and accordingly in the Morn|ing,
I &s;ent our long Boat and Shallop on Shore,
with two and thirty Men in them both, to get
Intelligence; ordering them if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;peak
with &s;ome Body, before they went on Shore, and
know, how things &s;tood; that then, if it was a
Party of the Pyrates, they &s;hould, by no means,
come near them, but parley at a Di&s;tance, till
they knew, what the Meaning of it all was.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my Men came near the Shore, they
&s;aw plainly, that it was a Body of near an hundred
of the Pyrates, but &s;eeing them &s;o &s;trong, they
&s;tood off, and would not come nearer, nor near
enough, to parly with them, upon this the Men
on Shore, got one of the I&s;landers Canvas Boats,
or rather, Boats, made of Skins, which are but
&s;orry ones at be&s;t, and put off with two Men, to
manage the Sail, and one Sitter, and two Pad|dles
for Oars, and away they came toward us,
carrying a Flag of Truce, that is to &s;ay, an old
white Rag; how they came to &s;ave &s;o much Lin|nen
among them all, was very hard to &s;ay.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="91">
Our Men could do no le&s;s, than receive their
Amda&s;&s;ador, and a Flag of Truce gave no Shad|dow
of Apprehen&s;ion, e&s;pecially con&s;idering the
Figure they made, and that the Men on Shore
had no other Boats to &s;urprize or attack us with;
&s;o they lay by upon their Oars, till they came up,
when they &s;oon under&s;tood who they were; <HI>viz.</HI>
that they were the Gunner's &s;elected Men, that
they came too late, to have their Signal perceiv'd
from the other Ship, which was gone out of fight
of the Place they were directed to; that they had
with great Difficulty, and five Days and Nights
marching, got thro'a woody and almo&s;t unpa&s;&s;able
Country to come at us; that they had fetch'd a
Circuit of near an hundred Miles, to avoid being
attack'd by their Comrades, and that they were
pur&s;ued by them, with their whole Body, and
therefore they beg'd to be taken on board; they &s;aid
if they &s;hould be overtaken by their Comrades,
they &s;hould be all cut in Peices, for that they had
broke away from them by Force, and moreover
had been oblig'd at the fir&s;t of their Pur&s;uit, to
face about, and fire among them, by which they
had kill'd &s;ix or &s;even of them, and wounded
others, and that they had &s;worn, they would
give them no Quarter, if they could come fairly
up with them.</P>
<P>Our Men told them, they mu&s;t be contented
to remain on Shore, where they were, for &s;ome
Time, for that they could do nothing, till they
had been on board, and acquainted their Captain
with all the particulars, &s;o they came back im|mediately
to me for Orders.</P>
<P>As to me, I was a little unea&s;y at the Thoughts
of taking them on board; I knew they were a
Gang of Pyrates at be&s;t, and what they might do
<PB N="89" REF="92">
I knew not, but I &s;ent them this Me&s;&s;age, that
tho' all their Tale might be very good for ought
I knew, yet that I mu&s;t take &s;o much Time, as
to &s;end an Expre&s;s to the Captain of the other
Ship, to be inform'd of the Faith of it; and that
if he brought a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer, I would &s;end
for them all on board.</P>
<P>This was very uncomfortable News to them,
for they expected to be &s;urrounded every Hour by
their Comrades, from whom they were to look for
no Mercy; however &s;eeing no Remedy, they re|&s;olv'd
to march about twenty Miles farther <HI>South,</HI>
and lie by in a Place near the Sea, where we
agreed to &s;end to them; concluding, that their
Comrades not finding them near the place where
we lay, would not imagine, they could be gone
farther that way; As they gue&s;s'd, &s;o it prov'd,
for the Pyrates came to the Shore, where they
&s;aw Tokens enough of their having been there,
but concluded, that &s;eeing they could not be
found there, they were all gone on board our
Ship.</P>
<P>The Wind proving contrary, it was no le&s;s
than four Days before our Boat came back, &s;o
that the poor Men were held in great Su&s;pence:
But when they returned, they brought the Gun|ner
with them, who had &s;elected tho&s;e Men from
all the re&s;t for our new Ship; and who, when he
came, gave me a long Account of them, and
what Care he had taken to pick them out for our
Service, delivering me al&s;o a Letter from my
new Captain to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e: Upon all
which concurring Circum&s;tances, we concluded
to take them on board; &s;o we &s;ent our Boats for
them, who at twice brought them all on board,
and very &s;tout hone&s;t Fellows they were.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="93">
When they had been on board &s;ome Days and
refre&s;h'd them&s;elves, I concluded to &s;end them
all on board the new Ship; but upon Advice, I
re&s;olved to &s;end &s;ixty of my own Men joyn'd to
forty of the&s;e, and keep thirty four of them on
board my Ship; for their Number was ju&s;t &s;e|venty
four, which with the Gunner and his twen|ty
one Men, and the &s;ixteen Men who came
with the worthy Emba&s;&s;adors, and would not go
on Shore again, made one hundred and twelve
Men; and as we all thought were enough for us,
tho' we took in between forty and fifty more
afterwards.</P>
<P>We were now ready to go to Sea, and I cau&s;ed
the new Ship and the Brigantine to come away
from the Place where they lay and joyn us; which
they did, and then we unloaded Part of our
Provi&s;ions and Ammunition; of which, as I ob|&s;erv'd
at fir&s;t, we had taken in double Quantity;
and having furni&s;hed the new Ship, with a Pro|portion
of all Things nece&s;&s;ary, we prepar'd for
our Voyage.</P>
<P>I &s;hould here give a long Accuont of a &s;econd
devili&s;h Con&s;piracy, which my two remaining
Pri&s;oners had form'd among the Men; which
was to betray the new Ship to the Pyrates: But
'tis too long a Story to put in here; nor did I
make it publick among the Ship's Company: But
as it was only, <HI>as it were,</HI> laid down in a Scheme,
and that they had no Opportunity to put it in
Practice, I thought it was better to make as little
Noi&s;e of it as I could. So I order'd my new
Captain, <HI>for it was he who di&s;covered it to me,</HI> to
puni&s;h them in their own Way, and without ta|king
Notice of their new Villanies, to &s;et them
on Shore, and leave them to take their Fate
<PB N="91" REF="94">
with a Set of Rogues, who they had intended
to joyn with, and who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion was likely,
&s;ome Time or other, to bring them to the Gal|lows.
And thus I was rid of two incorrigible
Mutineers; what became of them afterwards I
never heard.</P>
<P>We were now a little Fleet, (<HI>viz</HI>) two large
Ships and a Brigantine, well mann'd, and fur|ni&s;h'd
with all &s;orts of Nece&s;&s;aries for any
Voyage or any Enterprize that was fit for Men
in our Po&s;ture to undertake; and particularly
here, I made a full De&s;ign of the whole Voyage,
to be again openly declared to the Men, and had
them ask'd, One by One, if they were willing
and re&s;olv'd to undertake it, which they all very
chearfully an&s;wered in the Affirmative.</P>
<P>Here we had Opportunity to furni&s;h our &s;elves
with a va&s;t Stock of excellent Beef, which as I
&s;aid before, we cur'd with little or no Salt, by
drying it in the Sun; and I believe we laid
in &s;uch a Store, that in all our three Ve&s;&s;els we
had near an hundred and fifty Tun of it; and
it was of excellent U&s;e to us, and &s;erv'd us
thro' the whole Voyage: There was little el&s;e
to be had in this Place that was fit to be carried
to Sea; except, that as there was plenty of Milk,
&s;ome of our Men that were more dexterous than
others, made &s;everal large Chee&s;es; nor were
they very far &s;hort of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Chee&s;e, only that
we were but indifferent Dairy-Folks: Our Men
made &s;ome Butter al&s;o, and &s;alted it to keep, but
it grew rank and oily, and was of no U&s;e to
us.</P>
<P>It was on the fifteenth of <HI>December</HI> that we
left this Place, a Country fruitful, populous,
full of Cattle, large and excellent good Beef,
<PB N="92" REF="95">
and very fat; and the Land able to produce all
Manner of good Things; but the People wild,
naked, black, barbarous, perfectly untracta|ble,
and in&s;en&s;ible of any State of Life being
better than their own.</P>
<P>We &s;tood away toward the Shore of <HI>Arabia,</HI>
till we pa&s;t the Line, and came into the Lati|tude
of eighteen Degrees <HI>North,</HI> and then &s;tood
away <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and <HI>E.</HI> by <HI>N.</HI> for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Facto|ries
of <HI>Surrat,</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar;</HI> not
that we had any Bu&s;ine&s;s there, or de&s;ign'd any,
only that we had a mind to take on Board a
Quantity of Rice, if we could come at it; which
at la&s;t we effected by a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, which we
met with at Sea, bound to <HI>Goa</HI> from the Gulph
of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> We chas'd her and brought her too
indeed, as if we re&s;olv'd to attack and take the
Ship; but finding a Quantity of Rice on Board,
which was what we wanted, with a Parcel of
Coffee; we took all the Rice, but paid the <HI>Su|pra
Cargo,</HI> who was a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> or <HI>Armenian</HI> Mer|chant,
very hone&s;tly for the whole Parcel, his full
Price, and to his Satisfaction: As for the Coffee we
had no Occa&s;ion for it: We put in at &s;everal Ports
on the <HI>Indian</HI> Coa&s;t for fre&s;h Water, and fre&s;h
Provi&s;ions, but came near none of the Factories,
becau&s;e we had no mind to di&s;cover our &s;elves;
for tho' we were to &s;ail thro' the very Center of
the <HI>India</HI> Trade, yet it was perfectly without any
Bu&s;ine&s;s among them. We met indeed on this
Coa&s;t with &s;ome Pearl Fi&s;hers, who had been in
the Mouth of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulph, and had a
large Quantity of Pearl on Board. I would have
traded with them for Goods, but they under&s;tood
nothing but Money, and I refus'd to part with
it: Upon which, the Fellows gave our <HI>Supra
<PB N="93" REF="96">
Cargo</HI> &s;ome &s;curvy Language, which, tho' he did
not well under&s;tand what they &s;aid, yet he pre|tended
to take it as a great Affront, and threatned
to make Prize of their Barks, and Slaves of the
Men; upon which, they grew very humble; and
one of them, a <HI>Malabar Indian,</HI> who &s;poke a lit|tle
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;poke for them, that they would wil|lingly
trade with us for &s;uch Goods as we had;
whereupon I produced three Bales of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Cloth, which I &s;hew'd them, would be of good
Merchandi&s;e at <HI>Gombaroon</HI> in the Gulph, for that
the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> made their long Ve&s;ts of &s;uch
Cloths.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, for this Cloth, and &s;ome Money, we
bought a Box of choice Pearls, which the Chief
of them had pick'd out from the re&s;t for the
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Merchants at <HI>Goa;</HI> and which, when
I came to <HI>London,</HI> was valued at two thou&s;and
two hundred Pound Sterling.</P>
<P>We were near two Months on our Voyage
from <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> to the Coa&s;t of <HI>India,</HI> and from
thence to <HI>Ceylon,</HI> where we put in, on the <HI>South
We&s;t</HI> Part of the I&s;land, to &s;ee what Provi&s;ions
we could get, and to take in a large Supply of
Water. The People here we found willing to
&s;upply us with Provi&s;ions; but withal, &s;o &s;harp,
impo&s;ing upon us their own Rates for every
Things; and withal, &s;o fal&s;e, that we were often
provoked to treat them very rudely. Howe|ver,
I gave &s;trict Orders that they &s;hould not be
hurt upon any Occa&s;ion; at lea&s;t, 'till we had fill'd
all our Water Cask, and taken in what fre&s;h
Provi&s;ions we could get, and e&s;pecially Rice,
which we valued very much: But they provok'd
us at la&s;t beyond all Patience; for they were
&s;uch Thieves when they were on Board, and &s;uch
<PB N="94" REF="97">
treacherous Rogues when we were on Shore,
that there was no bearing it; and two Accidents
fell out upon this Occa&s;ion, which fully broke the
Peace between us; one was on Board, and the o|ther
was on Shore, and both happened the &s;ame
Day. The Ca&s;e on Board was this; there came on
Board us a &s;mall Boat, in which was eleven Men
and three Boys, to &s;ell us Roots, Yams, Mangoes,
and &s;uch Stuff as it was frequent for them to do
every Day; but this Boat having more Goods of
that Kind than u&s;ual, they were longer than or|dinary
making their Market: While they were
thus Chaffering on Board, one of them having
wandred about the Ship, and pretending to
admire every Thing he &s;aw, and being gotten
between Decks, was taken &s;tealing a Pair of
Shoes, which belong'd to one of the Seamen;
the Fellow being &s;topt for his Theft, appear'd
angry, rai&s;ed a hideous skreaming Noi&s;e to al|larm
his Fellows; and at the &s;ame Time, having
&s;tolen a long Pair of Ci&s;&s;ars, pull'd them out,
and &s;tabb'd the Man that had laid hold of him
into the Shoulder, and was going to double his
Blow, when the poor Fellow that had been
wounded, having &s;truck up his Heels aud fallen
upon him, had kill'd him, if I had not call'd to
take him off, and bring the Theif up to me.</P>
<P>Upon this Order, they took up the <HI>Barbarian,</HI>
and brought him up with the Shoes and the Ci&s;|&s;ars
that he had &s;tolen, and as the Fact was plain,
and needed no Witne&s;&s;es, I cau&s;ed all the re&s;t
of them to be brought up al&s;o; and as well as we
could, made them under&s;tand what he had done.
They made pitiful Signs of Fear, lea&s;t they
&s;hould all be puni&s;hed for his Crime, and par|ticularly
when they &s;aw the Man, who he had
<PB N="95" REF="98">
wounded brought in; then they expected no|thing
but Death, and they made a &s;ad Lementa|tion
and Howling, as if they were all to die im|mediately.
It was not without a great deal of
Difficulty that I found Ways to &s;atisfy them,
that no Body was to be puni&s;hed but the Man that
had committed the Fact; and then I cau&s;ed him
to be brought to the Geers, with a Halter about
his Neck, and be &s;oundly whipp'd; and indeed
our People did &s;courge him &s;everely from Head
to Foot; and I believe, if I had not run my &s;elf
to put an End to it, they had whipp'd him to
Death.</P>
<P>When this Execution was over, they put him
into their Boat and let them all go on Shore: But
no &s;ooner were they on Shore, but they rai&s;ed a
terrible Hubbub among all the Villages and
Towns near them, and they were not a few, the
Country being very Populous; and a va&s;t Multi|tude
of them came down to the Shore, &s;taring
at us, and making confu&s;ed ugly Noi&s;es, and a|bundance
of Arrows they &s;hot at the Ship, but
we rode too far from the Shore for them to do us
any Hurt.</P>
<P>While this was doing, another Fray happen'd
on Shore, where two of our Men Chaffering
with an I&s;lander and his Wife for &s;ome Fowls,
they took his Money, or what el&s;e it was he was
to give, and gave him Part of the Fowls, but
they pretended the Woman &s;hould go and fetch
the re&s;t, while the Women was gone, three or
four more of the &s;ame Sort came to the Man
that was left, and talking a while together,
&s;eeing they were &s;o many, and our Men but
two, they began to take hold of the Fowls they
had &s;old, and would take them away again; at
<PB N="96" REF="99">
which, one of our Men &s;tep'd up to the Fellow
that had taken them up, and went to lay hold of
him, but he was too nimble for him, and ran
away and carried off the Fowls and the Money
too. The Seamen was &s;o enrag'd to be &s;erv'd &s;o,
that he took up his Piece, for they had both
Fire Arms with them, and fir'd immediately af|ter
him, and aim'd his Shot &s;o luckily, that tho'
the Fellow flew like the Wind, he &s;hot him
thro' the Head, and he drop'd down dead up|on
the Spot.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of them, tho' terribly frighted, yet
&s;eeing our Men were but two, and the Noi&s;e
bringing twenty or thirty more immediately to
them, attack'd our Men with their Lances, and
Bows and Arrows; and in a Moment, there was a
pitch'd Battle of two Men only again&s;t twenty
or thirty, and their Number encrea&s;ing too.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, our Men &s;pent their Shot freely a|mong
them as long as it la&s;ted, and kill'd &s;ix or
&s;even, be&s;ides wounding ten or eleven more;
and this cool'd their Courage, and they &s;eem'd
to give over the Battel; and our Men, who&s;e
Ammunition was almo&s;t &s;pent, began to think
of retreating to their Boat, which was near a
Mile off, for they were very unhappily gotten
from their Boat &s;o far up the Country.</P>
<P>They made their Retreat pretty well for about
half the Way, when, on a &s;udden, they &s;aw they
were not pur&s;ued only, but &s;urrounded, and that
&s;ome of their Enemies were before them. This
made them double their Pace, and &s;eeing
no Remedy, they re&s;olv'd to break thro' tho&s;e
that were before them, who were about eleven
or twelve: Accordingly, as &s;oon as they came
within Po&s;tol &s;hot of them, one of our Men
<PB N="97" REF="100">
having, for want of Shot, put almo&s;t a Hand|ful
of Gravel and &s;mall Stones into his Piece, and
fired among them, and the Gravel and Stones
&s;cattering, wounded almo&s;t all of them; for they
being naked from the Wa&s;te upwards, the lea&s;t
Grain of Sand &s;cratch'd and hurt them, and made
them bleed if it did but touch them.</P>
<P>Being thus compleatly &s;car'd, and indeed more
afraid than hurt, they all run away, except two
who were really wounded with the Shot or
Stones, and lay upon the Ground: Our Men let
them lye, and made the be&s;t of their Way to their
Boat; where, at la&s;t, they got &s;afe, but with
five hundred of the People at their Heels; their
Fellows did not &s;tay to fire from the Boat, but
put off with all the Speed they could, for fear
of their poi&s;on'd Arrows, and the Country Peo|ple
pour'd &s;o many of their Arrows into the
Boat after them, and aim'd them al&s;o &s;o true,
that two of our Men were hurt with them; but
whether they were poi&s;on'd or no, our Surgeons
cur'd them both.</P>
<P>We had enough of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> and having no Bu|&s;ine&s;s
to make &s;uch a Kind of War as this mu&s;t
have been, in which we might have lo&s;t, but
could get nothing, we weigh'd and &s;tood away
to the <HI>Ea&s;t;</HI> what became of the Fellow that
we la&s;h'd, we know not; but as he had but little
Fle&s;h left on his Back, which was not mangled,
and torn with our whipping him, and we &s;up|po&s;e,
they are but indifferent Surgeons, our
People &s;aid the Fellow could not live: and the
Rea&s;on they gave for it, was becau&s;e they did
not pickle him after it. Truly, they &s;aid, that
they would not be &s;o kind to him as to pickle
him: For tho' Pickling, that is to &s;ay, throwing
<PB N="98" REF="101">
Salt and Vinegar on the Back after the whipping
be cruel enough, as to the Pain it is to the Pati|ent,
yet 'tis certainly the Way to prevent Mor|tification,
and cau&s;es it to heal again with the
more Ea&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;tood over from <HI>Ceylon E. S. E.</HI> cro&s;s the
great Bay of <HI>Bngal,</HI> leaving all the Coa&s;t o$
<HI>Coromandel,</HI> and &s;tanding directly for <HI>Anchin</HI>
on the <HI>North</HI> Point of the great I&s;land of <HI>Sumatra</HI>
and in the Latitude of &s;ix Degrees thirty on$
Minutes <HI>North.</HI></P>
<P>Here we &s;pread our <HI>French</HI> Colours, and com|ing
to an Anchor, &s;uffer'd none of our Men to
go on Shore but Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> and his <HI>French</HI>
Men; and having nothing to do there, or any
where el&s;e in the <HI>Indian Seas,</HI> but to take in Pro|vi&s;ions
and fre&s;h Water, we &s;taid but five Days
in which Time, we &s;upply'd our &s;elves with
what the Place would afford; and pretending to
be bound for <HI>China,</HI> we went on to the <HI>South,</HI>
thro' the Streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI> between the
I&s;land of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and the <HI>Main or I&s;thmus</HI> of
<HI>Malacca.</HI></P>
<P>We had here a very difficult pa&s;&s;age, tho' we
took two Pilots on Board at <HI>Anchin,</HI> who pre|tended
to know the Streights perfectly well; twice
we were in very great Danger of being lo&s;t, and
once our <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship was &s;o entangled a|mong
Rocks and Currents, that we gave her
up for lo&s;t, and twice &s;he &s;truck upon the Rocks,
but &s;he did but touch, and went clear.</P>
<P>We went &s;everal Times on Shore among the
<HI>Malayans,</HI> as well on the Shore of <HI>Malacca</HI> it &s;elf,
as on the Side of <HI>Sumatra:</HI> They are a fierce,
cruel, treacherous, and mercile&s;s Crew of hu|mane
Devils as any I have met with on the Face
<PB N="99" REF="102">
of the whole Earth; and we had &s;ome Skirmi|&s;hes
with them, but not of any Con&s;equence:
We made no Stay any where in this Streight,
but ju&s;t for fre&s;h Water, and what other fre&s;h
Provi&s;ions we could get, &s;uch as Roots, Greens,
Hogs and Fowls, of which they have Plenty and
a great Variety: But nothing to be had but for
ready Money; which our Men took &s;o unkindly,
and e&s;pecially their offering two or three Times
to cheat them, and once to murther them; that
after that, they made no Scruple to go on Shore
a hundred or more at a Time, and plunder and
burn what they could not carry off; till at la&s;t
we began to be &s;uch a Terror to them, that
they fled from us wherever we came.</P>
<P>On the fifth of <HI>March</HI> we made the
<HI>Southermo&s;t</HI> Point of the <HI>I&s;thmas</HI> of <HI>Mallacca;</HI> and
the I&s;land, and Streights of <HI>Sincapore,</HI> famous for
its being the great Outlet into the <HI>Chine&s;e Sea,</HI>
and lying in the Latitude of one Degree fifteen
Minutes <HI>North</HI> Latitude.</P>
<P>We had good Weather thro' the&s;e Streights,
which was very much to our Comfort; the dif|ferent
Currents, and Number of little I&s;lands,
making it otherwi&s;e very dangerous, e&s;pecially
to Strangers: We got by very good Luck, a <HI>Dutch</HI>
Pilot ta carry us thro' this Streight, who was a
very u&s;eful skilful Fellow, but withal &s;o very
impertinent and inqui&s;itive, that we knew not
what to &s;ay to him nor what to do with him: At
la&s;t he grew &s;aucy and in&s;olent, and told our
chief Mate, that he did not know but we might
be Pyrates, or at lea&s;t Enemies to his Country|men
the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and if we would not tell him
who we were, and whither we were bound,
he would not Pilot us any farther.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="103">
This I thought very in&s;olent, to a Degree be|yond
what was &s;ufferable; and I bid the Boat|&s;wain
put a Haller about the Fellow's Neck,
and tell him, that the Moment he omitted to
direct the Steerage as a Pilot, or the Moment
the Ship came to any Misfortune, or &s;truck up|on
any Rock, he &s;hould be tru&s;s'd up. The
Boat&s;wain, a rugged Fellow, provides him&s;elf
with a Halter, and coming up to the Pilot, ask'd
him, <HI>What it was he wanted to be &s;atisfied in?</HI> The
Pilot &s;aid, he de&s;ired to have a true Account
whither we were going: <HI>Why,</HI> &s;ays the Boat|&s;wain,
<HI>we are a going to the Devil, and I &s;hall &s;end
you before to tell him we are coming;</HI> and with that,
he pulls the Halter out of his Pocket, and puts
it over his Head; and taking the other End of
it in his Hand, <HI>Come,</HI> &s;ays the Boat&s;wain, <HI>come
along with me; do you think we can't go thro' the
Streight of</HI> Sincapore <HI>without your Help; I warrant
you,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>we will do without you.</HI></P>
<P>By this Time, you may &s;uppo&s;e, the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Man to be in a mortal Fright, and half choak'd too
with being drag'd by the Throat with the Hal|ter,
and full heartily he begg'd for his Life: At
Length, the Boat&s;wain, who had pull'd him a|long
a good Way, &s;topp'd, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man
fell down on his Knees; but the Boat&s;wain &s;aid,
he had the Captain's Orders to hang him, and
hang him he would, unle&s;s the Captain recall'd
his Orders; but that he would &s;tay &s;o long, if
any Body would go up to the Captain, and tell
him what the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man &s;aid, and bring back
an An&s;wer.</P>
<P>I had no De&s;ign to hang the poor Fellow, you
may be &s;ure, and the Boat&s;wain knew that well
enough: However, I was re&s;olv'd to humble
<PB N="101" REF="104">
him effectually, &s;o I &s;ent back two Men to the
Boat&s;wain; the fir&s;t was to tell the Boat&s;wain
aloud, that the Captain was re&s;olv'd to have
the Fellow hang'd, for having been &s;o impudent
to threaten to run the Ship a-Ground: But then
the &s;econd, <HI>who was to &s;tay a little behind,</HI> was to
call out, as if he came &s;ince the fir&s;t from me,
and that I had been prevail'd with to pardon him,
on his Promi&s;es of better Behaviour: This was
all acted to the Life; for the fir&s;t Me&s;&s;enger
call'd aloud to the Boat&s;wain, that the Captain
&s;aid he would have the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man hang'd for
a Warning to all Pilots, and to teach them not
to in&s;ult Men when they are in Difficulties, as the
Midwives do Whores in Travel, and won't de|liver
them till they confe&s;s who is the Father.</P>
<P>The Boat&s;wain had the End of the Halter
in his Hand all the while; <HI>I told you &s;o, &s;ays he,
before, come, come along MYNHEER,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I
&s;hall quickly do your Work,</HI> and put you out of your Pain;
and then he dragg'd the poor Fellow along to
the Main-ma&s;t: By this Time the &s;econd Me&s;|&s;enger
came in and delivered his Part of the
Errand, and &s;o the poor <HI>Dutch</HI> Man was put out
of his Fright, and they gave him a Dram to re|&s;tore
him a little, and he did his Work very
hone&s;tly afterwards.</P>
<P>And now we were got loo&s;e again, being in
the open Sea, which was what we were very
impatient for before. We had now a long Run
over that Part which we call the Sea of <HI>Borneo,</HI>
and the upper Part of the <HI>Indian Arches,</HI> call'd
&s;o for its being full of I&s;lands, like the <HI>Archi|pelague</HI>
of the <HI>Levant.</HI> It was a long Run, but
as we were to the <HI>North</HI> of the I&s;lands, we had
the more Sea-room; &s;o we &s;teer'd <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> half a
<PB N="102" REF="105">
Point, one Way or other for the <HI>Manilla's,</HI> or
<HI>Phillipine</HI> I&s;lands; which was the true De&s;ign
of our Voyage, and, perhaps, we were the fir&s;t
Ship that ever came to tho&s;e I&s;lands freighted
from <HI>Europe</HI> &s;ince the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> lo&s;t their Foot|ing
there.</P>
<P>We put in on the <HI>North</HI> Coa&s;t <HI>of Borneo</HI> for
fre&s;h Water, and were civilly enough u&s;ed by
the Inhabitants of the Place, who brought us
Roots, and Fruits of &s;everal Kinds, and &s;ome
Goats, which we were glad of: We paid them
in Trifles; &s;uch as Knives, Ci&s;&s;ars, Toys, and
&s;everal Sorts of wro$ght Iron, Hatchets, Ham|mers,
Gla&s;s-work, Looking-gla&s;&s;es, Drinking-gla&s;&s;es,
and the like. From hence we went a|way,
as I &s;ay, for the <HI>Phillipine</HI> I&s;lands. We &s;aw
&s;everal I&s;lands in our Way, but made no &s;top ex|cept
once for Water, and arriv'd at <HI>Manilla</HI> the
twenty &s;econd of <HI>May,</HI> all our Ve&s;&s;els in very good
Condition, our Men healthy, and our Ships
&s;ound; having met with very few contrary Winds,
and not one Storm in the whole Voyage from
<HI>Madaga&s;ear,</HI> having been &s;eventeen Months and
two Days on the Voyage from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>When we came hither, we &s;aluted the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Flag, and came to an Anchor, carrying <HI>French</HI>
Colours: Captain <HI>Merlotte,</HI> who now acted as
Commander, &s;ends his Boat on Shore the next
Day to the Governor with a Letter in <HI>French</HI> very
re&s;pectful; and telling the Governor, that hav|ing
the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion, and being
come into tho&s;e Seas, he hop'd, that for the
Friend&s;hip which was between their Mo&s;t Chri&s;ti|an
and Catholick Maje&s;ties, he &s;hould be allow'd
the Freedom of Commerce, and the U&s;e of the
Port; the like having been granted to his Mo&s;t
<PB N="103" REF="106">
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's Subjects in all the Ports of
<HI>New Spain,</HI> as well in the <HI>Southern</HI> as in the <HI>Nor|thern
Seas.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governor returned a very civil
and obliging An&s;wer, and immediately granted
us to buy what Provi&s;ions we plea&s;ed for our
Supply, or any Thing el&s;e for our U&s;e; but an|&s;wered,
that as for allowing any Exchange of
Merchandizes, or giving Leave for <HI>European</HI>
Goods to be brought on Shore there, that he was
not empower'd to grant.</P>
<P>We made as if this An&s;wer was &s;atisfactory e|nough
to us; and the next Morning, Captain
<HI>Merlotte</HI> &s;ent his Boat on Shore with all <HI>French</HI>
Sailors, and a Mid&s;hip-man <HI>French,</HI> with a hand|&s;ome
Pre&s;ent to the Governor; con&s;i&s;ting of
&s;ome Bottles of <HI>French</HI> Wine, &s;ome Brandy, two
Pieces of Fine Holland, two Pieces of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
black Bays, one Piece of $ine <HI>French</HI> Drugget,
and five Yards of Scarlet Woollen Cloth.</P>
<P>This was two con&s;iderable a Pre&s;ent for a <HI>Spa|niard</HI>
to refu&s;e; and yet the&s;e were all <HI>European</HI>
Goods, which he &s;eem'd not to allow to come
on Shore. The Governor let the Captain know,
that he accepted his Pre&s;ent; and the Men who
brought it, were very hand&s;omely entertained by
the Governor's Order, and had every one a
&s;mall Piece of Gold; and the Officer who went
at their Head, had five Pieces of Gold given him:
What Coin it was I could not tell, but I think it
was a <HI>Japan</HI> Coin, and the Value &s;omething le&s;s
than a Pi&s;tole.</P>
<P>The next Day the Governor &s;ent a Gentleman
with a large Boat, and in it a Pre&s;ent to our
Captain; containing two Cows, ten Sheep or
Goats rather, for they were between both; a va&s;t
<PB N="104" REF="107">
Number of Fowls of &s;everal Sorts, and twelve
great Boxes of Sweetmeats and Con&s;erves, which
were indeed very valuable; and invited the Cap|tain
and any of his Attendants on Shore, offer|ing
to &s;end Ho&s;tages on Board for our &s;afe re|turn;
and concluding with his Word of Honour
for our Safety, and free going back to our
Ships.</P>
<P>The Captain received the Pre&s;ent with very
great Re&s;pect, and indeed it was a very noble
Pre&s;ent; for at the &s;ame Time a Boat was &s;en$
to both the other Ships with Provi&s;ions and
Sweetmeats, in Proportion to the Bigne&s;s of the
Ve&s;&s;els. Our Captain cau&s;ed the Gentleman who
came with this Pre&s;ent, to have a fine Piece o$
Crim&s;on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth given him &s;ufficient to make
a Wa&s;tecoat and Breeches of their Fa&s;hion, wit$
a very good Hat, two Pair of Silk Stockings
and two Pair of Gloves; and all his People had
a Piece of Drugget given them &s;ufficient to make
them the like Suit of Clothes; the Per&s;ons who
went to the other Ship, and to the Brigantine
had Pre&s;ents in Proportion.</P>
<P>This, in &s;hort, was neither more or le&s;s than
Trading and Bartering, tho' for the Grimac$
of it, we were, in a Manner, deny'd. The next
Day the Captain went on Shore to vi&s;it the Go|vernor,
and with him &s;everal of our Officers, and
the Captain of the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship, formerly
my &s;econd Mate, and the Captain of the Brigan|tine.
I did not go my &s;elf for that Time, nor
the <HI>Supra Cargo,</HI> becau&s;e whatever might hap|pen,
I would be re&s;erv'd on Board; be&s;ides I
did not care to appear in this Part of the
Work.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="108">
The Captain went on Shore like a Captain,
attended with his two Trumpeters, and the Ship
firing eleven Guns at his going off. The Gover|nor
received him like him&s;elf, with prodigious
State and Formality; &s;ending five Gentlemen
and a Guard of Soldiers to receive them at their
Landing, and to conduct them to his Palace:
when they came there, they were entertained
with the utmo&s;t Profu&s;ion, and wonderful Magnifi|cence,
after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Manner; and they all had
the Honour to dine with his Excellence, that is
to &s;ay, all the Officers: At the &s;ame Time the
Men were entertain'd very hand&s;omely in ano|ther
Hou&s;e, and had very good Cheer: But it
was ob&s;erv'd, that they had very little Wine,
except &s;uch as we had &s;ent them; which the Go|vernor
excu&s;ed; his Store, which he had yearly
from <HI>New Spain,</HI> being &s;pent; which Deficiency
we &s;upply'd the next Day, and &s;ent him a
Quarter Cask of very good <HI>Canary,</HI> and a half
Hog&s;hed of <HI>Madera;</HI> which was a Pre&s;ent &s;o
acceptable, that in &s;hort, after this, we might
do ju&s;t as we plea&s;ed with him, and all his
Men.</P>
<P>While they were thus conver&s;ing together, af|ter
Di$ner, Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> was made to under|&s;tand,
that tho' the Governer could not admit
an open avow'd Trade, yet that the Merchants
would not be forbid coming on Board our Ship,
and Trading with us in &s;uch Manner as we
&s;hould be very well &s;atisfied with; after which,
we &s;hould be at no Hazard of getting the
Goods we &s;hould &s;ell, put on Shore; and we
had an Experiment of this made in a few Days
as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="109">
When Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> took his leave of the
Governour, he invited his Excellence to come or
board our Ship, with &s;uch of his Attendants as he
pleas'd to bring with him, and in like manner of|fered
Ho&s;tages for his Return; the Governour
accepted the Invitation, and with the &s;ame Ge|nero&s;ity
&s;aid, he would take his Parole of Ho|nour
given, as he was the King of <HI>France's</HI> Cap|tain,
and in the Name of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Ma|je&s;ty,
and would come on board.</P>
<P>The Governour did not come to the Shore &s;ide
with them, but &s;tood in the Window of the Pa|lace,
and gave them his Hat and Leg at their go|ing
into their Boats, and made a Signal to the
Platform, to fire eleven Guns at their Boats put|ing
off.</P>
<P>The&s;e were unu&s;ual and unexpected Honours
to us, who, but for this Stratagem of the <HI>French
Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> had been declared Enemies: It was
&s;ugge&s;ted to me here, that I might with great
Ea&s;e &s;urprize the whole I&s;land, nay all the I&s;lands,
the Governour putting &s;uch Confidence in us, that
we might go on &s;hore in the very Fort un&s;u&s;pect|ed:
But tho' this was true, and that we did play
them a Trick at the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> I could not bear
the Thoughts of it here; be&s;ides I had quite ano|ther
Game to play, which al&s;o was more advan|tage
to us and to our Voyage, than an Enterpri&s;e
of &s;o much Treachery could be to <HI>England,</HI> which
al&s;o, we might not be able to &s;upport from <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> might beat us out again
from <HI>Acapulco,</HI> and then we might pa&s;s our Time
ill enough.</P>
<P>Upon the whole I re&s;olv'd to keep every Punc|tilio
with the Governour very ju&s;tly, and we
found our Account in it pre&s;ently.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="110">
About three days afterwards we had Notice,
that the Governour would make us a Vi&s;it, and
we prepared to entertain his Excellence with as
much State as po&s;&s;ible by the way we had pri|vate
Notice, that the Governour would bring
with him &s;ome Merchants, who perhaps might
lay out &s;ome Money, and buy &s;ome of our Cargo;
nor was it without a &s;ecret Intimation, that even
the Governour him&s;elf was concern'd in the Mar|ket
that &s;hould be made.</P>
<P>Upon this Intelligence, our <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> cau&s;|ed
&s;everal Bales of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Goods to be
brought up and open'd, and lay'd &s;o in the Steer|age
and upon the Quarter Deck of the Ship, that
the Governour and his Atttendants &s;hould &s;ee
them of cour&s;e as they pa&s;s'd by.</P>
<P>When the Boats came off from the &s;hore,
which we knew by their Fort firing eleven Guns as
before, our Shipappear'd as fine as we could make
her, having the <HI>French</HI> Flag at the main Top as
Admiral, and Streamers and Penants at the Yard
Arms, wa&s;te Cloths out, and a very fine Awning
over the Quarter Deck. When his Excellency en|tered
the Ship, we fir'd one and twenty Guns,
the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship fir'd the like Number, and
the Brigantine fifteen, having loaded her Guns
nimbly enough to fire twice.</P>
<P>As the Governour's Entertainment to us, was
more Meat than Liquor, &s;o we gave him more
Liquor than Meat; for as we had &s;everal Sorts of
very good Wines on board, we &s;par'd nothing to
let him &s;ee, he was very welcome. After Dinner
we brought a large Bowl of Punch upon the Ta|ble,
which was a Liquor he did not under&s;tand at
all: However to do him ju&s;tice, he drank very mo|derately,
and &s;o did mo&s;t of tho&s;e that were with
<PB N="108" REF="111">
him. As to the Men that belong'd to his Retinue,
I mean Servants and Attendants and the Crews
of the Boats, we made &s;ome of them drunk
enough.</P>
<P>While this was doing, we fonnd two Gentle|men
of the Governour's Company, took Occa&s;ion
to leave the re&s;t and walk about the Ship,
and in doing this, they &s;eem'd as it were by
chance to ca&s;t their Eyes, upon our Bales of
Cloth and Stuffs, Bays, Linnen, Silks, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> and our
<HI>Supra Cargo</HI> and they began to make Bargains
apace, for he found they had not onely Money
enough, but had abundance of other Things,
which we were as willing to take as Money, and
of which they had brought Specimens with them;
as particularly Spices, &s;uch as Cloves and Nut|megs,
<HI>China</HI> Ware, Tea, Japan'd Ware, wrought
Silks, raw Silk, and the like.</P>
<P>However our <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> dealt with them at
pre&s;ent for Nothing but ready Money, and they
paid all in Gold; the Price he made here, was to
us indeed extravagant, tho' to them moderate,
&s;eeing they had been us'd to buy the&s;e Goods
from the <HI>Acapulco</HI> Ships, which came in yearly,
from whom, to be &s;ure, they bought dear enough.
They bought as many Goods at this Time, as they
paid the Value of fifteen thou&s;and Peices of
Eight for, but all in Gold by Weight.</P>
<P>As for carrying them on Shore, the Governour
being with them, no Officer had any Thing to &s;ay
to them; it &s;eems, they were carryed on Shore as
Pre&s;ents, made by us to the Governour and his
Retinue.</P>
<P>The next Day three <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchants came
on board us, early in the Morning before it was
Light, and de&s;ir'd to &s;ee the <HI>Supra Cargo;</HI> they
<PB N="109" REF="112">
brought with them a Box of Diamonds and &s;ome
Pearl, and a great Quantity of Gold, and to work
they went with our Cargo, and I thought once,
they would have bought the whole Ship's Loading;
but they contented them&s;elves to buy about the
Value of two and twenty thou&s;and Peices of
Eight, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, might co&s;t in <HI>England,</HI>
one &s;ixth Part of the Money, or hardly &s;o much.
We had &s;ome Difficulty about the Diamonds, be|cau&s;e
we did not under&s;tand them very much, but
our <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> ventur'd upon them at eight
thou&s;and Peices of Eight, and took the re&s;t in
Gold: They de&s;ir'd to &s;tay on Board till the next
Night, when, &s;oon after it was dark, a &s;mall
Sloop came on Board, and took in all their
Goods, and as we were told, carryed them away
to &s;ome other I&s;land.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day and before the&s;e Merchants
were gone, came a large Shallop on Board with a
&s;quare Sail, towing after her a great heavy Boat,
which had a Deck, but &s;eem'd to have been a
large Ship's long Boat, built into a Kind of
Yatch, but ill ma&s;ted, and &s;ail'd heavily. In the&s;e
two Boats they brought &s;even Tun of Cloves in
Matts, &s;ome Che&s;ts of <HI>China</HI> Ware, &s;ome Pieces
of <HI>China</HI> Silks, of &s;everal Sorts, and a great
Sum of Money al&s;o.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, they &s;old &s;o cheap and bought &s;o dear,
that our <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> declar'd, he would &s;ell the
whole Cargo for Goods, if they would bring
them, for by his Calculation, he had di&s;pos'd of
as many Goods, as he receiv'd the Value of one
hundred thou&s;and Peices of Eight for, all which,
by his Accounts did not amount to, fir&s;t Co&s;t, a|bove
three thou&s;and Pounds Sterling in <HI>England,</HI>
Our Ship was now an open Fair, for two or three
<PB N="110" REF="113">
Days after came the Ve&s;&s;el back, which went away
in the Night, and with them a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Jonque, and
&s;even or eight <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> or <HI>Japanners;</HI> &s;trange, ugly,
ill looking Fellows they were, but brought a <HI>Spa|niard</HI>
to be their Interpreter, and they came to
Trade al&s;o, bringing with them &s;eventy great
Che&s;ts of <HI>China</HI> Ware, exceeding fine, twelve
Che&s;ts of <HI>China</HI> Silks of &s;everal Sorts, and &s;ome
laquer'd Cabinets very fine. We dealt with them
for all tho&s;e, for our <HI>Supra Cargo</HI> &s;wept all clean,
and took every thing they brought. But they
were more difficult in the Goods, for as for Bayes,
and Druggets, and &s;uch Goods, they would not
meddle with them; but our fine Cloths and &s;ome
Bales of Linnen they bought very freely. So
we unloaded their Ve&s;&s;el, and put our Goods on
Board; we took a good Sum of Money of them
be&s;ides, but whither they went we knew not,
for they both came and went in the Night too,
as the other did.</P>
<P>This Trade held a good while, and we found,
that our Cu&s;tomers came more from other
I&s;lands, than from the I&s;land where the Governour
re&s;ided, the Rea&s;on of which, as we under&s;tood
afterwards, was, becau&s;e as the Governour had
not openly granted a Freedom of Commerce, but
privately wink'd at it, &s;o they were not wil|ling
to carry it on openly before his Face, or <HI>as
we &s;ay,</HI> under his No&s;e, whereas in other I&s;lands,
they could convey their Goods on Shore with
very little Hazard, agreeing with the Cu&s;tom|hou&s;e
Officer for a finall Matter.</P>
<P>The&s;e Boats came and went thus &s;everal Times,
till in &s;hort we had di&s;pos'd almo&s;t of the whole
Cargo; and now our Men began to be convinc'd,
that we had lay'd out our Uoyage very right, for
<PB N="111" REF="114">
never was Cargo better &s;old; and as we re&s;olv'd
to pur&s;ue our Voyage for new <HI>Spain,</HI> we had ta|ken
in a Cargo very proper to &s;ell there, and &s;o
perhaps to double the Advantage we had already
made.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, all our Hands were at Work
to &s;tore our &s;elves anew, with &s;uch Provi&s;ions, as
could be had here for &s;o long a Run, as we knew
we were to have next; namely, over the va&s;t <HI>Pa|cifick</HI>
Ocean or <HI>South Sea,</HI> a Voyage where we
might expect to &s;ee no Land for four Months, ex|cept
we touch'd at the <HI>Ladrones,</HI> as it might hap|pen;
and our greate&s;t Anxiety was for Want of
Water, wihch our whole Ship could &s;carce be a|ble
to &s;tow &s;ufficient for our U&s;e, and if they
could, our Want of Casks was &s;till as bad as the
Want of Water, for we really knew not what
to put Water in when we had it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> had help'd us to &s;ome Casks but
not many, tho&s;e that they could &s;pare were but
&s;mall, and at la&s;t we were oblig'd to make u&s;e of
about two hundred large earthen Jars, which were
of &s;ingular U&s;e to us. We got a large Quantity of
good Rice here, which we bought of a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Mer|chant,
who came in here with a large <HI>China</HI> Ve&s;|&s;el
to trade, and who bought of us al&s;o &s;everal of
our <HI>European</HI> Goods.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as we were ready to &s;ail, a Boat came
from the Town of <HI>Manilla,</HI> and brought a new
Merchant, who wanted more <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods, but
we had but few left; he brought with him thirty
Che&s;ts of Callicoes, Mu&s;lins, wrought Silks, &s;ome
of them admirably fine indeed, with fifteen Bales
of Romals, and twelve Tun of Nutmegs. We
&s;old them what Goods we had left, and gave
them Money for the re&s;t, but had them at a
<PB N="112" REF="115">
Price &s;o cheap, as was &s;ufficient to let us know,
that it was always well worth while, for Ships to
trade from <HI>Europe</HI> to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indias;</HI> from
whence they are &s;ure to make five or &s;ix of one.
Had more of the&s;e Merchants come on Board, we
were re&s;olv'd to have lay'd out all the Gold and
Silver we had on Board, which, I a&s;&s;ure you, was
a very con&s;iderable Quantity.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Merchant, who came on Board us,
was a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> but I found, that he &s;poke very
good <HI>French,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that he had been
in <HI>England</HI> &s;ome Years ago, and under&s;tood <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Woolen Manufactures very well; he told me, they
had the&s;e Goods all from <HI>Acapulco,</HI> but that they
were then exce&s;&s;ive dear, he had con&s;iderable
Dealings with the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and &s;ome with the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> and <HI>Bengale,</HI> and kept a Ve&s;|&s;el
or two of his own to go to <HI>Bengal,</HI> which ge|nerally
went twice in a Year.</P>
<P>I found, he had great Bu&s;ine&s;s with new <HI>Spain,</HI>
and that he generally had one of the <HI>Acapulco</HI>
Ships chiefly con&s;ign'd to him; &s;o that he was full
of all &s;uch Goods, as tho&s;e Ships generally carry|ed
away from the <HI>Manilla's,</HI> and had we traded
with him &s;ooner, we had had more Callicoes and
Mu&s;lins, than we now had: However we were
exceedingly well &s;tor'd with Goods of all Sorts,
&s;uitable for a Market in <HI>Peru,</HI> whither I re&s;olv'd
to go.</P>
<P>We continued chaffering after this Manner a|bout
nine Weeks, during which Time, we car|reen'd
our Ships, clean'd their Bottoms, rummag'd
our Gold, and repack'd &s;ome of our Provi&s;ions;
endeavouring as much as po&s;&s;ible, to keep all our
Men as fully employ'd as we could, to pre&s;erve
<PB N="113" REF="116">
them in Health, and yet not to over work them,
con&s;idering the Heat of the Climate.</P>
<P>Some Time before we were ready to &s;ail, I
call'd all the Warrant Officers together, and told
them, that as we were come to a Country, where
Abundance of &s;mall Things were to be bought,
and going to a Country, where we might po&s;&s;ibly
have Room to &s;ell them again to Advantage, I
would advance to every Officer an hundred Dollars,
upon Account of their Pay, that they might lay it
out to their Advantage here, and di&s;po&s;e it again
on the Coa&s;t of <HI>New Spain,</HI> this was very accepta|ble
to them, and they acknowledg'd it; and here,
be&s;ides this, by the Con&s;ent of all our Superior Offi|cers,
I gave a Large&s;s or Bounty of five Dollars a
Man, to all our Fore-Ma&s;t Men; mo&s;t of which, I
believe, they lay'd out in Arrack and Sugar, to
chear them up in the re&s;t of the Voyage, which
they all knew would be long enough.</P>
<P>We went away from <HI>Marcilla</HI> in the I&s;land of
<HI>Luzon</HI> or <HI>Luconia</HI> the fifteenth of the Month of
<HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and in the Year 1714$ and &s;ailing a while
to the <HI>Southward,</HI> pa&s;s'd the Straits between that
I&s;land, and <HI>Mindanoa,</HI> another of the <HI>Phillipines,</HI>
where we met with little extraordinary, except
extraordinary Lightning and Thunders, &s;uch as we
never heard or &s;aw before, tho' it &s;eems, 'tis very
familiar in that Climate; till about &s;ixteen Days
&s;ailing, we &s;aw the I&s;le of <HI>Guam,</HI> one of the <HI>La|drones,</HI>
or I&s;le of <HI>Thieves,</HI> for &s;o much the Word im|ports;
here we came to an Anchor <HI>Sept.</HI> 3. under the
Lee of a &s;teep Shore, on the <HI>North</HI> Side of the I&s;le
of <HI>Guam;</HI> but, as we wanted no Trade here, we
did not at fir&s;t $word$ after the chief Port, or
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governour, or any thing of that Kind $
but we chang'd our Situation the next Day, and
<PB N="114" REF="117">
went thro' the Pa&s;&s;age, to the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Side of the
I&s;land, and came to an Anchor off of the Town.</P>
<P>The People came off, and brought us Hogs,
and Fowls, and &s;everal Sorts of Roots, and
Greens, Things, which we were very glad of,
and which we bought the more of, becau&s;e we al|ways
found, that &s;uch Things were good to keep
the Men from the Scurvy, and even to cure them
of it, if they had it; we took in fre&s;h Water here
al&s;o, tho' it was with &s;ome Difficulty, the Water
lying half a Mile from the Shore.</P>
<P>When I parted from <HI>Manilla,</HI> and was geting
thro' the Strait between the I&s;land <HI>Lucon,</HI> and
that of <HI>Mindanoa,</HI> I had &s;ome Thoughts of &s;teering
away <HI>North,</HI> to try, what Land we might meet
with to the <HI>North Ea&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Phillipines;</HI> and with
Intent to have endeavour'd to make up into
the Latitude of fifty or &s;ixty Degrees, and have
come about again to the <HI>South,</HI> between the I&s;land
of <HI>California,</HI> and the main Land of <HI>America;</HI> in
which Cour&s;e, I did not que&s;tion, meeting with
extraordinary new Di&s;coveries, and perhaps &s;uch
as the Age might not expect to hear of, relat|ing
to the <HI>Northern</HI> World, and the Po&s;&s;ibility of
a Pa&s;&s;age out of tho&s;e Seas, either <HI>Ea&s;t or We&s;t,</HI> both
which, I doubt not, would be found, if they were
&s;earch'd after this Way; and which, for ought
I know, remain undi&s;covered for want only of an
Attempt being made by tho&s;e Seas, where it
would be ea&s;y to find, whether the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Seas
are navigable or not? And whether <HI>Nova Zembla</HI>
be an I&s;land, or joyn'd to the Main? Whether the
Inlets of <HI>Hud&s;on's Bay</HI> have any opening into the
<HI>We&s;t</HI> Sea, and whether the va&s;t Lakes, from whence
the great River of <HI>Canada</HI> is &s;aid to flow, have
any Communication this Way, or not.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="118">
But tho' the&s;e were valuable Di&s;coveries, yet
when I began to ca&s;t up the Account in a more
&s;erious Manner, they appear'd to have no Rela|tion
to, or Coherence with our intended Voy|age
or with the De&s;ign of our Employers,
which we were to con&s;ider in the fir&s;t Place; for
tho' it is true that we were encourag'd to make all
&s;uch Kinds of u&s;eful Di&s;coveries, as might tend to
the Advantage of Trade, and the Improvement
of Geographical Knowledge and Experience; yet
it was all to be &s;o directed, as to be &s;ub&s;ervient to
the Profits and Advantages of a trading and crui&s;|ing
Voyage.</P>
<P>It is true, that the&s;e <HI>Northern</HI> Di&s;coveries
might be inimitably fine, and mo&s;t glorious
Things to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, and infinitely for
the future Advantage of Commerce in general:
yet, as I have &s;aid, it was evident, that they
tended directly to de&s;troy the Voyage, either as
to trading, or to crui&s;ing, and might perhaps end
in our own De&s;truction al&s;o; for Example; fir&s;t
of all, if adventuring into tho&s;e <HI>Northern</HI> Seas,
we &s;hould, by our Indu&s;try, make out the Di&s;co|very,
and find a Pa&s;&s;age, either <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> or <HI>We&s;t;</HI> we
mu&s;t follow the Di&s;covery &s;o, as to venture quite
thro', or el&s;e we could not be &s;ure, that it was
really a Di&s;covery; for the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages would not
be like doubling Cape <HI>de Bon E&s;perance,</HI> on the Point
of <HI>Africa;</HI> or going round Cape <HI>Horn,</HI> the <HI>Southermo&s;t</HI>
Point of <HI>America,</HI> either of which were compa&s;s'd
in a few Days, and then immediately gave an open|ing
into the <HI>Indian</HI> or <HI>Southern</HI> Oceans, where good
Weather and certain Refre&s;hment were to be had.</P>
<P>Whereas, for the Di&s;covery in the <HI>North,</HI>
after having pa&s;s'd the <HI>Northermo&s;t</HI> Land of <HI>Grand
Tartary,</HI> in the Latitude of &s;eventy four, even to
<PB N="116" REF="119">
eighty Degrees, and perhaps to the very <HI>North</HI>
Pole: there mu&s;t be a Run <HI>We&s;t,</HI> beyond the mo&s;t
<HI>Northerly</HI> Point of <HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> and on again <HI>W.
S. W.</HI> about the <HI>North</HI> Kyn and <HI>North</HI> Cape above
&s;ix hundred Leagues, before we could come to
have any Relief of the Climate after that, one
hundred and &s;ixty Leagues more, and even to <HI>Shet|land</HI>
and the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> before we could
meet with any Relief of Provi&s;ions, which, after
the Length we mu&s;t have run, from the Latitude
of three Degrees and an half, where we now were
at the <HI>Phillipine,</HI> I&s;lands, to &s;eventy four, Degrees
<HI>North</HI> being near five thou&s;and Miles, would be im|po&s;&s;ible
to be done; unle&s;s we were &s;ure to victual,
and furni&s;h our &s;elves again, with Provi&s;ions and
Water by the Way, and that in &s;everal Places.</P>
<P>As to the other Pa&s;&s;age <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> towards the Con|tinent
of <HI>America,</HI> we had this uncertainty al&s;o;
namely, that it was not yet di&s;cover'd, whether
the Land of <HI>California</HI> was an I&s;land, or a Conti|nent,
and if it &s;hould prove the latter, &s;o as
that we &s;hould be oblig'd to come back to the
<HI>We&s;t,</HI> and not be able to find an Opening, be|tween
<HI>California</HI> and the Land of <HI>North America,</HI>
&s;o as to come away to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mexico,</HI> to
<HI>Acapulco,</HI> and &s;o into the <HI>South Sea,</HI> and at the
&s;ame Time &s;hould not find a Pa&s;&s;age thro' <HI>Hud|&s;on's
Bay, &amp;c.</HI> into the <HI>North Sea,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Eu|rope:</HI>
we &s;hould not only &s;poil the Voyage that
Way al&s;o, but &s;hould infallibly peri&s;h by the Se|verity
of the Sea&s;on, and want of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Things argued again&s;t any Attempt
that Way; whereas on the other Hand, for <HI>South|ern</HI>
Di&s;coveries we had this particular Encourage|ment;
that what ever Di&s;appointment we might
meet with, in the Search after unknown Coun|tries,
<PB N="117" REF="120">
yet we were &s;ure of an open Sea behind
us; and that when ever we thought fit, to run
<HI>South</HI> beyond the <HI>Tropick,</HI> we &s;hould find innume|rable
I&s;lands, where we might get Water, and
&s;ome Sort of Provi&s;ions, or come back into a favou|rable
Climate, and have the Benefit of the Trade
Winds, to carry us either backward or forward,
as the Sea&s;on &s;hould happen to guide us.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all, we had this A&s;&s;urance, that, the
Dangers of the Seas excepted, we were &s;ure of an
Outlet, before us, if we went forward, or be|hind
us, if we were forc'd back, and having a
rich Cargo, if we were to do nothing but go
home, we &s;hould be able to give our Employers
&s;uch an Account of our &s;elves, as that they
would be very far from being Lo&s;ers by the Voyage;
but that if we reach'd &s;afe to the Coa&s;t of <HI>New
Spain,</HI> and met with an open Commerce there, as
we expected, we &s;hould perhaps make the mo&s;t
pro&s;perous Voyage, that was ever made round
the Globe before.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations put an End to all my
Thoughts of going <HI>Northward;</HI> &s;ome of our &s;ecret
Council, <HI>for by the way, we con&s;ulted our Forema&s;t
Men no more, but had a</HI> &s;ecret Council <HI>among our
&s;elves, the Re&s;olutions of which we &s;olemnly engag'd
not to di&s;clo&s;e:</HI> Some of the&s;e, I &s;ay, were for
&s;teering the u&s;ual Cour&s;e, from the <HI>Phillipines</HI> to
<HI>New Spain, viz.</HI> keeping in the Latitudes of ele|ven
or thirteen Degrees, <HI>North</HI> of the Line, and &s;o
making directly for <HI>California;</HI> in which Latitude
they propos'd, that we might perhaps, by crui&s;ing
there about, meet with the <HI>Manilla</HI> Ships, going
from <HI>New Spain</HI> to <HI>Manilla,</HI> which we might take
as a Prize, and then &s;tand directly for the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="121">
But I oppos'd this; principally, becau&s;e it
would effectually overthrow all my meditated
Di&s;coveries to the <HI>Southward;</HI> and &s;econdly, be|cau&s;e
I had ob&s;erv'd, that on the <HI>North</HI> of the
Line, there are no I&s;lands to be met with, in all
the long Run, of near two thou&s;and Leagues, from
<HI>Guam</HI> one of the <HI>Ladrones,</HI> to the Land of <HI>Cali|fornia;</HI>
and that we did not find, we were able to
&s;ub&s;i&s;t during &s;o long a Run, e&s;pecially for Want
of Water; whereas on the <HI>South</HI> of the Line, as
well within the <HI>Tropick</HI> as without, we were &s;ure
to meet with I&s;lands $nnumerable, and that even
all the Way, &s;o that we were &s;ure of frequent
Relief of fre&s;h Water, of Plants, Fowl, and Fi&s;h,
if not of Bread and Fle&s;h, almo&s;t all the Way.</P>
<P>This was a main Con&s;ideration to our Men,
and &s;o we &s;oon re&s;olv'd to take the <HI>Southern</HI> Cour&s;e;
yet, as I &s;aid, we &s;tood away for the <HI>Ladrones</HI> fir&s;t;
the&s;e are a Clu&s;ter of I&s;lands, which lie in about
eleven to thirteen Degrees <HI>North</HI> Latitude,
<HI>North Ea&s;t</HI> from the <HI>Moluccoes,</HI> or Spice I&s;lands,
and E. and by N. from that Part of the <HI>Phil|lipines</HI>
where we were, and at the Di&s;tance of
about four hundred Leagues, and all the Ships,
which go or come between the <HI>Phillipines</HI> and
<HI>New Spain,</HI> touch at them, for the Convenience
of Provi&s;ions, Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho&s;e, that go to <HI>Spain,</HI>
put in there, in Order to recruit and furni&s;h <HI>for,</HI>
and tho&s;e that come from <HI>Spain,</HI> to relieve them|&s;elves
<HI>after</HI> &s;o long a Run as that of &s;ix thou&s;and
Miles, for &s;o much it is at lea&s;t from <HI>Guam</HI> to
<HI>Acapulco;</HI> on the&s;e Accounts, and with the&s;e Rea|&s;onings,
we came to the I&s;les of the <HI>Ladrones.</HI></P>
<P>During our Run between the <HI>Phillipine</HI> and <HI>La|drone</HI>
I&s;lands, we liv'd wholly upon our fre&s;h Pro|vi&s;ions,
of which we laid in a great Stock at <HI>Ma|nilla,</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="122">
&s;uch as Hogs, Fowls, Calves, and &s;ix or
&s;even Cows, all alive, &s;o that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beef and
Pork, which lay well &s;tor'd, was not touch'd for
a long Time.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Ladrones</HI> we recruited, and particularly
took on Board, as well alive as pickl'd up, near
two hundred Hogs, with a va&s;t Store of Roots,
and &s;uch Things as are their u&s;ual Food in that
Country; we took in al&s;o above three thou&s;and
cocoa Nuts and Cabbages; Yams, Potatoes and
other Roots for our own U&s;e, and in particular
we got a large Quantity of Maiz, or <HI>Indian</HI>
Wheat for Bread, and &s;ome Rice.</P>
<P>We &s;tor'd our &s;elves likewi&s;e with Oranges
and Lemons, and buying a great Quantity of very
good Limes, we made three or four Hog&s;heads of
Limejuice; which was a great Relief to our Men
in the hot Sea&s;on, to mix with their Water; as
for making Punch, we had &s;ome Arrack and &s;ome
Sugar, but neither of them in any Quantity, &s;o
as to have much Punch made afore the Ma&s;t.</P>
<P>We were eighteen Days on our Pa&s;&s;age from
the Streight of <HI>Mindanoa</HI> to <HI>Guam,</HI> and &s;tay'd
&s;ix Days at <HI>Guam,</HI> furni&s;hing our &s;elves with Pro|vi&s;ions,
appearing all this while with <HI>French</HI> Co|lours,
and Captain <HI>Merlotte</HI> as Commander:
However, we made no great Ceremony here
with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governor, as I have &s;aid already,
only that Captain <HI>Merlotte,</HI> after we had been
here two Days, &s;ent a Letter to him by a <HI>French</HI>
Officer, who &s;howing his Commi&s;&s;ion from the
King of <HI>France;</HI> the Governor pre&s;ently gave us
Product, as we call it, and Leave to buy what
Provi&s;ions we wanted: In Compliment for this
Civility, we &s;ent the Governor a &s;mall Pre&s;ent
of $ine Scarlet Cambler, and two Pieces of Bays;
<PB N="120" REF="123">
and he made a very hand&s;ome Return, in &s;uch
Refre&s;hments as he thought we mo&s;t wanted.</P>
<P>There was another Rea&s;on for our keeping in
this Latitude till we came to the <HI>Ladrones:</HI>
namely, that all the <HI>Southern</HI> Side of that Part
of the Way between the <HI>Phillipines</HI> and the <HI>La|drones,</HI>
$word$ &s;o full of I&s;lands, that unle&s;s we had
had very $word$ Pilots, it would have been very
hazardous; and $word$ to this, that beyond the&s;e
I&s;lands <HI>South</HI> is no $word$ the Land, which they
call <HI>Nova Guinea,</HI> lying away <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and E. S. E.;
farther than has yet been di&s;cover'd; &s;o that it
is not yet known, whether that Country be an
I&s;land or the Continent.</P>
<P>Having for all the&s;e Rea&s;ons gone to the <HI>La|drones,</HI>
and being &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied in our Rea|&s;ons,
for going away from thence to the <HI>Southward,</HI>
and having &s;tor'd our &s;elves as above, with where|ver
tho&s;e I&s;lands produc'd, we left the <HI>Ladrones,</HI>
$word$ $word$ $word$ of <HI>September</HI> in the Evening,
and &s;tood away E. S. E. with the Wind N. N. W.
a fre&s;h $word$ after this, I think, it was about
five Days, when having &s;tretch'd by our Account
about an hundred and fifty Leagues, we $word$
away more to the <HI>Southward,</HI> our Cour&s;e S E. by S.</P>
<P>And now, if ever, I expected to do &s;omething
by Way of Di&s;covery; I knew very well there
were $ew, if any, had ever &s;teer'd that Cour&s;e; or
that if they had, they had given very little Ac|count
of their Travels. The only Per&s;on who
leaves any Thing worth Notice; being <HI>Cornelius
Van&s;$houton</HI> and <HI>Francis La Mare,</HI> who, tho'
they &s;ail'd very much <HI>South,</HI> yet &s;ay little to the
Purpo&s;e, as I &s;hall &s;hew pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth Day after we parted from the
<HI>Ladrones,</HI> being, by Ob&s;ervation, in the Latitude
<PB N="121" REF="124">
of &s;eventeen Degrees <HI>South</HI> of the Line, one of
our Men cried a Sail, a Sail, which put us into
&s;ome $it of Wonder, knowing, nothing of a
Ship of any Bulk could be met with in tho&s;e Seas;
but our $it of Wonder was &s;oon turn'd to a fit of
Laughter, when one of our Men from the Fore|top,
cried out <HI>Land,</HI> which indeed was the Ca&s;e;
and the fir&s;t Sailor was &s;ufficiently laugh'd at
for his Mi&s;take, tho', give him his due, it look'd
at fir&s;t as like a Sail, as ever any Land at a Di|&s;tance
could look.</P>
<P>Towards Evening, we made the Land very
plain, Di&s;tance about &s;even Leagues <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> and
found that it was not an I&s;land, but a va&s;t Tract
of Land, extended, as we had Rea&s;on to be|lieve,
from the Side of <HI>Gillolo,</HI> and the Spice
I&s;lands, or that which we call <HI>Nova Guinea,</HI> and
never yet fully di&s;covered. The Land lying a|way
from the <HI>We&s;t N. W.</HI> to the <HI>S. E.</HI> by <HI>South.</HI>
&s;till <HI>Southerly.</HI></P>
<P>I that was for making all po&s;&s;ible Di&s;covery, was
willing, be&s;ides the Convenience of Water, and
perhaps fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, to put in her, and &s;ee
what kind of a Country it was: So I ordred the
Brigantine to &s;tand in for the Shore: They &s;ound|ed,
but found no Ground within half a League
of the Shore; &s;o they hoy&s;ted out their Boat and
went clo&s;e in with the Shore, where they found
good Anchor hold in about thirty &s;ix Fathom,
and a large Creek, or Mouth of a River;
here they found eleven to thirteen Fathom &s;oft
ouzy Sand, and the Water half fre&s;h at the
Mouth of the Creek.</P>
<P>Upon Notice of this, we &s;tood in, and came
all to an Anchor in the very Creek; and &s;ending
our Boats up the $reek, found the Water per|fect
<PB N="122" REF="125">
fre&s;h and very good upon the Ebb, about a
League up the River.</P>
<P>Among all the I&s;lands in this Part of the
World, that is to &s;ay, from the <HI>Phillipines Ea&s;tward,</HI>
of which there are an infinite Number, We ne|ver
came near any, but we found our &s;elves &s;ur|rounded
with Canoes and Variety of Boats,
bringing off to us <HI>Cocoa Nutts,</HI> Plantanes, Roots
and Greens, to traffick for &s;uch Things as they
could get; and that in &s;uch Numbers as we were
tired with them, and &s;ometimes allarm'd, and
oblig'd to fire at them. But here, tho' we &s;aw
great Numbers of People at a Di&s;tance from
the Shore, yet we &s;aw not one Boat or Bark,
nor any Thing el&s;e upon the Water.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd two or three Days taking in fre&s;h
Water, but it was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train our
Men from going on Shore, to &s;ee what Sort of
a Country it was; and I was very willing they
&s;hould do &s;o: Accordingly, two of our Boats,
with about thirty Men in both of them, went
on Shore on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Side of the Creek or Har|bour,
where our Ship lay.</P>
<P>They found the Country look'd wild and &s;a|vage
enough, but tho' they could find no Hou&s;es
or &s;peak with the Inhabitants, they &s;aw
their Foot&s;teps and their Seats where they had
&s;at down under &s;ome Trees; and after wandring
about a little, they &s;aw People, both Men and
Women at a Di&s;tance; but they run away from
our Men, at fir&s;t Sight, like frighted Deer; nor
could they make any Signal to them to be under|&s;tood;
for when our Men hallood, and call'd af|ter
them, they run again as if they had been
bewitch'd.</P>
<P>Our Men gather'd a great Variety of green
<PB N="123" REF="126">
Stuff, tho' they knew not of what Kind, and
brought it all on Board, and we eat a great
deal of it; &s;ome we boyl'd and made Broth of;
and &s;ome of our Men, who had the Scurvy,
found it did them a great deal of Good; for the
Herbs eat all &s;picey, and had a mo&s;t plea&s;ant
agreeable Ta&s;te; but none of us could tell what
to call them, tho' we had &s;everal Men on Board
who had been among the Spice I&s;lands before in
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ships.</P>
<P>We were very unea&s;y that we could get no|thing
here but a little Gra&s;s and Pot-herbs, as
our Men call'd it, and the Men mov'd me to let
them have two Boats, and go up the River as
high as the Tide would carry them: This I con|&s;ented
to, being as willing to make the Di&s;co|very
as they: So I ordered the Captain of the
<HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship, who had, as I have &s;aid, been
formerly my &s;econd Mate; I &s;ay, I order'd him
to go along with them.</P>
<P>But in the Morning, a little before the Flood
was made, I was call'd out of my Cabbin to &s;ee
an Army, as they told me, coming to attack
us: I turn'd out ha&s;tily enough, you may be
&s;ure, and &s;uch an Army no Ship were ever at|tack'd
with; for we &s;py'd three or four hundred
black Creatures, come playing and tumbling
down the Stream, towards us, like &s;o many Por|poi&s;es
in the Water: I was not &s;atisfied at fir&s;t that
they were humane Creatures; but would have
per&s;uaded our Men, that they were Sea-mon&s;ters;
and that they were certainly Fi&s;hes of &s;ome
&s;trange Kind.</P>
<P>But they quickly undeceiv'd us, for they came
&s;wimming about our Ships, &s;taring and won|dring,
and calling to one another but &s;aid not
<PB N="124" REF="127">
one Word to us; at lea&s;t, if they did, we could
not under&s;tand it.</P>
<P>Some of them came very near our Ship, and
we made Signs to them to come on Board but
they would not veuture: We to&s;s'd one of them
a Rope, and he took hold of it boldly; but as
&s;oon as we offer'd to pull, he let go, and
laugh'd at us; another of them did the
like, and when he let go, turn'd up his black
Buttocks, as in Sport at us; the Language of
which, in our Country, we all knew, but whe|ther
they meant it &s;o or not, that we cannot
tell.</P>
<P>However, this dumb conver&s;ing with them,
we did not like, neither was it to any Purpo&s;e
to us; and I was re&s;olv'd, if po&s;&s;ible, to know
&s;omething more of them than we could get
thus: So I ordered out our Pinnace with &s;ix Oars,
and as many other Men, well arm'd, to row a|mong
them; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to take &s;ome of
them and bring them on Board. They went
off, but the &s;ix Oar Pinnace, tho' a very nimble
Boat, could not row &s;o fa&s;t as they could &s;wim;
for if pulling with all their might, they came near
one of them, immediately, like Dog and Duck,
they would dive and come up again thirty or
forty Yards off; &s;o that our Men did not know
which Way to row after them: However, at
la&s;t, getting among the thicke&s;t of them, they
got hold of two, and, with &s;ome Difficulty,
drag'd them in; but were &s;urpriz'd to find they
were both Women: However, they brought
them on Board naked as they were. When
they came on Board, I ordred they &s;hould have
two Pieces of Linnen wrapt round their Wa&s;$es
to cover them, which they &s;eem'd extraordina|ry
<PB N="125" REF="128">
glad of: We gave them al&s;o &s;everal Strings of
Beads, and our Men tyed them about their
Necks, and about their Arms like Bracelets, and
they were wonderfully pleas'd with that. O|thers
of our Men gave them each of them a Pair
of Sci&s;&s;ars, with Needles, and &s;ome Thread and
threading the Needles, &s;how'd them how to &s;ow
with them: We gave them Food, and each of
them a Dram of Arak, and made Signs to know
of them where they liv'd; they pointed up to
the River, but we could by no Means under&s;tand
them. When we had dre&s;s'd them up thus with
Necklaces, and Bracelets, and Linnen, we
brought them up upon the Deck, and made them
call to their Country Folk, and let them &s;ee
how well they were u&s;ed, and ask them to come
on Board, but they would not venture.</P>
<P>However, as I thought, the Di&s;covery we
were to make, would be &s;omething the ea&s;ier
on the Account of the U&s;age of the&s;e two
young Women; for they were not, as we gue&s;s,
above twenty or two and twenty Years of Age;
we re&s;olved, that the Boat &s;hould go on, as we
intended up the River; and that, as the&s;e two
Women pointed that Way, they &s;hould carry
them along with them.</P>
<P>Accordingly we &s;ent two Shallops or large
Boats, which carried together &s;ixty Men all well
arm'd. We gave them Store of Beads and
Knives, and Sci&s;&s;ars, and &s;uch Baubles with them,
with Hatchets and Nails, and Hooks, Looking-gla&s;&s;es,
and the like; and we built up the Sides
of the Boat and Stern, and cover'd them with
Boards to keep off Arrows and Darts, if they
&s;houd find Occa&s;ion; &s;o that they look'd like <HI>London</HI>
Barges: In this Po&s;ture, as &s;oon as the Tide of
<PB N="126" REF="129">
Flood was made up, our Men went away, carry|ing
a Drum and a Trumpet in each Boat; and
each Boat had al&s;o two Pattereroes fix'd on the
Gunnel near the Bow.</P>
<P>Thus furni&s;h'd, they went off about eleven
a Clock in the Forenoon, and to my very great
Unea&s;ine&s;s, I heard no more of them in four
Days; the whole Ship's Company were indeed
&s;urpriz'd at their Stay, and the Captain of the
Sloop would fain have had me let him have &s;ail'd
up the River with the Sloop as far as the Chan|nel
would &s;erve; which indeed we found was
deep enough. Indeed, as I was unwilling to
run any more Ri&s;ques; I could not per&s;wade
my &s;elf, but, that the Force I had already &s;ent,
was &s;ufficient to fight five thou&s;and naked Crea|tures,
&s;uch as the Natives &s;eem'd to be; and
therefore I was very unwilling to &s;end:
However, I con&s;ented, at la&s;t, to have our long
Boat and two &s;maller Boats mann'd with fifty
four Men more, very well arm'd and cover'd
from Arrows and Darts, as the other had been,
go up the River, upon their &s;olemn Promi&s;e, and
with expre&s;s Order, to return the next Day at
farthe&s;t; ordering them to fire Guns as they
went up the River to give Notice to their Fel|lows,
if they could be heard that they were
coming; and that in the mean Time, if I fir'd
three Guns, they &s;hould immediately return.</P>
<P>They went away with the Tyde of Flood,
a little before Noon, and went up the River a|bout
five Leagues; the Tide running but &s;lowly
up, and a &s;trong Fre&s;h of Land-water that
check'd the Tide coming down; &s;o that when
the Tide was &s;pent, they came to an Anchor;
they found the River contrary to their Expec|tation,
<PB N="127" REF="130">
continued both deep enough, and was
wider in Breadth than where the Ships were at
Anchor; and that it had another Mouth or Out|let
into the Sea &s;ome Leagues farther <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> &s;o
that the Land to the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> of us, where our Men
went on Shore, was but an I&s;land, and had not
many Inhabitants, if any at all; the People they
had &s;een there, having, po&s;&s;ibly, &s;wam over the
other Arm or Branch of the River to ob&s;erve
our Ships the nearer.</P>
<P>As our Men found they could go no farther
for want of the Tide, they re&s;olv'd to come to
an Anchor; but ju&s;t as they were &s;ounding, to
&s;ee what Ground they had, and what Depth,
a &s;mall Breeze at <HI>N. E.</HI> &s;prung up; by which they
&s;tem'd the Current, and reach'd up about two
Leagues farther, when they hove over their
Grapling in five Fathom Water, &s;oft Ground;
&s;o that all this Way, and much farther, all our
Ships might have gone up the Channel, being
as broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> is about <HI>Fox-hall.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd, that all along this River,
they found the Land, after they came pa&s;t the
Place where the other Branch of the River broke
off, <HI>Ea&s;tward,</HI> was full of Inhabitants on both Sides,
who frequently come down to the Waters-&s;ide
to gaze and look at our Boats. But always,
when our Men call'd to them, as if they thought
our Men enquir'd after their Fellows, they poin|ted
up the River; which was as much as to &s;ay,
they were gone farther that Way.</P>
<P>However, our Men being not able to go any
farther again&s;t the Tide, took no Notice of that;
but after a little while, &s;ome of them, in one of
the &s;maller Boats, row'd towards the Shore,
holding up a white Flag to the People, in Token
<PB N="128" REF="131">
of Peace: But it was all one, and would have been
been all one, for ought we know, if they had
held up a red Flag, for they run all away, Men,
Women and Children; nor could our Men by
any Per&s;ua&s;ions, by Ge&s;tures and Signs of any
Kind, prevail on them to &s;tay, or hardly &s;o
much as to look at them.</P>
<P>The Night coming on, our Men knew not
well what Cour&s;e to take; they &s;aw &s;everal of
the <HI>Indians</HI> Dwellings and Habitations, but they
were all at a Di&s;tance from the River, occa&s;ion'd,
as our Men &s;uppos'd, by the Rivers overflowing
the flat Grounds near its Banks, &s;o as to render
tho&s;e Lands not habitable.</P>
<P>Our Men had a great Mind to have gone up to
one of the Towns they &s;aw, but he, that com|manded,
would not permit it, but told them, that
if they could find a good landing Place, that they
might all go on Shore, except a few, to keep
the Boats, they would venture; upon which the
&s;malle&s;t Boat row'd up about a Mile, and found a
&s;mall River running into the greater, and here they
all re&s;olv'd to land: but fir&s;t they fir'd two
Muskets, to give Notice, if po&s;&s;ible, to their Com|rades,
that they were at Hand, however they
heard Nothing of them.</P>
<P>What Impre&s;&s;ion the Noi&s;e of the two Mus|kets
made among the <HI>Indians,</HI> they could not tell,
for they were all run away before.</P>
<P>They were no &s;ooner on Shore, but con&s;ider|ing
they had not above two Hours Day; and that
the <HI>Indian</HI> Villages were at lea&s;t two Miles off,
they call'd a Council, and re&s;olv'd not to march
&s;o far into a Country they knew &s;o little of, and
be left to come back in the dark; &s;o they went on
Board again and waited 'till Morning, however
<PB N="129" REF="132">
they view'd the Country, found it was a fer|tile
Soil, and a great Herbage on the Ground:
There were few Trees near the River; but far|ther
up, where the <HI>Indian</HI> Dwellings were, the
little Hills &s;eem'd to be covered with Woods,
but of what Kind they knew not.</P>
<P>In the Morning before break of Day, &s;ome of
our Men fa$cied they heard a Gun fir'd up the
River; upon which, the Officer ordered
two Mu&s;quets to be fir'd again, as had been
done the Evening before; in about a Quarter of
an Hour they were an&s;wer'd by the like Firing,
by which, our Men knew that their Comrades
heard them; &s;o without pur&s;uing their intended
Landing, the Tide being then running upwards,
they weigh'd, and &s;et to their Oars, having lit|tle
or no Wind, and that which was, blowing
down the Stream.</P>
<P>After they had gone about a League, they
heard a confu&s;ed Noi&s;e at a great Di&s;tance, which
&s;urprized them a little at fir&s;t; but as they per|ceiv'd
it drew nearer and nearer, they waited a
while, when they perceiv'd fir&s;t here and there
&s;ome People, then more, and then about two or
three hundred Men and Women together, run|ning,
and every one carrying &s;omething.</P>
<P>Whither it was they were going, or what it
was they carried, we could not tell till they came
nearer; when we found that they were all loaded
with Provi&s;ions, Cocoa Nuts, Roots, Cabbages,
and a great Variety of Things which we knew
little of; and all the&s;e were carrying down to
our Ships, as we under&s;tood afterwards, in Gra|titude
for our good U&s;age of the two young
Women.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="133">
When the&s;e People &s;aw our Men and their
three Boats, they were at a full Stop, and once
or twice they were ready to lay down all their
Loads and run for it; but ours made Signs of
Peace, and held up a white Flag to them.</P>
<P>Some of them, it &s;eems, having, as we found,
convers'd with our Men, had a little more Cou|rage
than the re&s;t, and came to the Shore &s;ide,
and look'd at the Boats: One of our Men be|thought
him&s;elf of a Stratagem to make known
to them our De&s;ire of Peace with them; and
taking a String of Beads and &s;ome Toys, he held
them up at the End of the Boat Hook Staff,
and &s;hew'd them to the <HI>Indians,</HI> pointing to them
with his Hand, and then pointing with the other
Hand, to what the <HI>Indians</HI> carry'd, and to his
Mouth, intimating, that we wanted &s;uch Things
to eat, and would give him the Beads for them.</P>
<P>One of the <HI>Indians</HI> pre&s;ently under&s;tood him,
and throws him&s;elf into the Water, holding a
Bundle of Plants, &s;uch as he had tru&s;s'd up toge|ther,
upon his Head, and &s;wiming with the other
Hand, and comes &s;o near the Boat, where our
Men held out the Staff, as to reach the End of
the Staff, take off the String of Beads and Toys,
and hang his Bunch of Tra&s;h, for it was no
better, upon the Hook, and go back again, but
would come no nearer.</P>
<P>When he was gotten on Shore again, all his
Comrades came about him, to &s;ee what he had
got; he hung the String of Beads about his Neck,
and run dancing about, with the other Things
in his Hand, as if he had been mad.</P>
<P>What our Men got, was a Trifle, of le&s;s
Worth, than a good Bunch of Carrots in <HI>England,</HI>
but yet it was u&s;eful, as it brought the People to
<PB N="131" REF="134">
conver&s;e with us; for after this, they brought us
Roots, and Fruits innumerable, and began to be
very well acquainted with us.</P>
<P>By that Time$our Men had chaffer'd thus, four
or five Times, they fir&s;t heard, and in a little
while after, &s;aw their two great Boats with their
Fellows, coming down the River, at about two
Miles di&s;tance, with their Drums and Trumpets,
and making Noi&s;e enough.</P>
<P>They had been, it &s;eems, about three Leagues
higher up, where they had been on Shore among
the <HI>Indians,</HI> and had &s;et at Liberty the two
Maidens, for &s;uch, they under&s;tood, they were;
who, letting their Friends &s;ee how fine they
were dre&s;s'd, and how well they were us'd, the
<HI>Indians</HI> were &s;o exceedingly oblig'd, and &s;hew'd
them&s;elves &s;o grateful, that they thought no|thing
too much for them; but brought out all
the Sorts of Provi&s;ions, which their Country
produc'd, which, it &s;eems, amounted to nothing,
but Fruits, &s;uch as Plantanes, Cocoa Nuts, O|ranges
and Lemons, and &s;uch Things, and Roots,
which we could give no Name to; but, that
which was mo&s;t for our U&s;e, was a very good
Sort of <HI>Maiz,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, which made us
very good Bread.</P>
<P>They had, it &s;eems, &s;ome Hogs, and &s;ome
Goats, but our Men got only &s;ix of the latter;
which were at hand, and were very good. But,
that which was mo&s;t remarkable, was, that
whereas, in all the I&s;lands within the <HI>Tropicks,</HI>
the People are thievi&s;h, treacherous, fierce, and
mi&s;chievous; and are arm'd with Lances, or
Darts, or Bows and Arrows: the&s;e appear'd to
be a peaceable, quiet, inoffen&s;ive People; nor
did our Men &s;ee any Weapon among them;
<PB N="132" REF="135">
except a long Staff, which mo&s;t of the Men
carried in their Hands; being made of a Cane,
about eight foot long, and an Inch and half Dia|meter,
much like a Quarter Staff; with which
they would leap over &s;mall Brooks of Water,
with admirable Dexterity.</P>
<P>The People were black, or rather of a tawny
dark brown; their Hair long, but curling in
very hand&s;ome Rings: They went generally quite
naked, both Men and Women; except that in
two Places, our Men &s;aid, they found &s;ome of
the Women cover'd, from the Middle down|ward.
They &s;eem'd to have no Conver&s;ation
with the Sea at all, nor did we &s;ee &s;o much as
any one Boat among them; nor did any of the
Inhabitants dwell near the Sea; but cultivated
their Lands very well, in their Way; having
abundance of Greens and Fruits, growing about
their Hou&s;es; and upon which, we found, they
chiefly liv'd. The Climate &s;eem'd to be very hot,
and yet the Country very fruitful.</P>
<P>The&s;e People, by all we could perceive, had
never had any conver&s;e, with the re&s;t of the
World by Sea, what they might have by Land,
we know not; but as they lie quite out of the
Way of all Commerce, &s;o it might be probable,
they never had &s;een a Ship, or Boat; whether
any <HI>European</HI> Ship, or &s;o much as a Periagua of the
I&s;lands. We have mention'd their neare&s;t
Di&s;tance to the <HI>Ladrones,</HI> being at lea&s;t four
hundred Leagues; and from the Spice I&s;lands,
and the Country of new <HI>Guinea,</HI> much more;
but as to the <HI>European</HI> Shipping, I never heard of
any, that ever went that Way, neither do I
believe, any ever did.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="136">
I take the more Notice of the&s;e People's not
having convers'd, as I &s;ay, with the World,
becau&s;e of the Innocence of their Behaviour,
their peaceable Di&s;po&s;ition, and their Way of
living upon the Fruits and Produce of the Earth;
al&s;o their Cultivation, and the Manner of their
Habitations; no Signs of Rapine or Violence
appearing among them. Our Stay here was &s;o
little, that we could make no Enquiry into their
Religion, Manner of Government, and other
Cu&s;toms: nor have I Room to crowd many of
the&s;e Things into this Account. They went
indeed naked, &s;ome of them &s;tark naked, both
Men and Women; but I thought, they differ'd in
their Countenances, from all the wild People,
that I ever &s;aw; that they had &s;omething &s;ingu|larly
hone&s;t, and &s;incere in their Faces; nor did
we find any Thing of Fal&s;hood or Treachery
among them.</P>
<P>The Gratitude they expre&s;t, for our kindly
u&s;ing the two young Women I have mention'd,
was a Token of generous Principles; and our
Men told us, that they would have given them
what ever they could have ask'd, if they had
had it.</P>
<P>In a Word, it was on their Account, they &s;ent
that little Army of People to us, loaden with
Provi&s;ions, which our Men met, before the two
Shallops came down. But all the Provi&s;ions they
had, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in Fruits of the Earth,
Cocoa Nuts, Plantanes, Oranges, Lemons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and <HI>Maiz,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Corn. We had not any
&s;ufficient Time with them, to enquire after
what Traffick they had, or whether any Thing
$it for us; that they had &s;everal fragrant Plants;
and I believe, &s;ome Spices, as particularly Cin|namon;
<PB N="134" REF="137">
that we found, but what el&s;e the Coun|try
produces, we know not.</P>
<P>We came away from hence, after &s;even Days
Stay, having ob&s;erv'd little of the Country,
more than that it &s;eem'd to be very plea&s;ant,
but very hot; the Woods were all flouri&s;hing
and green; and the Soil rich, but no great
Matter, that could be the Subject of Trade: But
an excellent Place, to be a Bait Land, or Port
of Refre&s;hment in any Voyage, that might after|wards
be undertaken that Way.</P>
<P>We&s;et Sail, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> from hence in &s;even Days, and
finding the Coa&s;t lie fairly on our Starboard
&s;ide, kept the Land on Board all the Way
Di&s;tance about three Leagues; and it held us
thus, about an hundred and twenty Leagues due
<HI>Ea&s;t;</HI> when, on a &s;udden, we lo&s;t Sight of
the Land; whether it broke off, or whether it
only drew off farther <HI>South,</HI> we could not tell.</P>
<P>We went on two or three Days more, our Cour&s;e
<HI>S. E.</HI> when we made Land again: but found it
to be onely two &s;mall I&s;lands, lying <HI>S.</HI> and by <HI>E.</HI>
Di&s;tance nine Leagues. We &s;tood on to them,
and two of our Boats went on Shore, but found
nothing for our Purpo&s;e; no Inhabitants, nor
any living Creatures, except Sea Fowls, and
&s;ome large Snakes; neither was there any fre&s;h
Water. So we call'd that Land Cape <HI>Di&s;mal.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Evening, we &s;tood away full <HI>South,</HI>
to &s;ee if we could find out the Continuance of
the former Land: But as we found no Land, &s;o
a great Sea coming from the <HI>South</HI> we conclud|ed,
we &s;hould find no Land that Way. And vary|ing
our Cour&s;e <HI>Ea&s;terly,</HI> we ran, with a fair fre&s;h
Gale at <HI>N. W.</HI> and by <HI>W.</HI> for &s;even Days more;
in all which Time, we &s;aw nothing but the open
<PB N="135" REF="138">
Sea, every Way; and, making an Ob&s;ervation,
found, we had pa&s;s'd the <HI>Southern Tropick;</HI> and
that we were in the Latitude of &s;ix and twenty
Degrees and thirteen Minutes; after which, we
continued our Cour&s;e &s;till <HI>Southerly</HI> for &s;everal Days
more; 'till we found by another Ob&s;ervation,
that we were in two and thirty Degrees, and
twenty Minutes.</P>
<P>This Evening we made Land over our Starboard
Bow, Di&s;tance &s;ix Leagues, and &s;tood away <HI>South</HI>
and by <HI>Ea&s;t:</HI> But the Wind &s;lackening, we lay
by in the Night; and, in the Morning, found
the Land bearing <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and by <HI>S.</HI> Di&s;tance one
League and a half; a good Shore and &s;ounding,
we found about five and thirty Fathom, &s;tony
Ground. Then we hoi&s;ted our Boat out, and &s;ent
it on Shore for Di&s;coveries, to &s;ound the Depth
of the Water, and &s;ee for a good Harbour to put
in at.</P>
<P>They went quite in with the Shore, where
they found People, Men, and Women, crowd|ing
together to look at us. When our Men came
clo&s;e to the Land, they hung out a white Flag;
but the wild People under&s;tood nothing of the
meaning of it; but &s;tood looking and amaz'd;
and we have great Rea&s;on to believe, that they
never had &s;een any Ship or Bark of any Nation,
in all their Lives, but their own. We found no
Boats, or Sails, or any Thing they had, to make
u&s;e of on the Water: But &s;ome Days after, we
&s;aw &s;everal &s;mall Canoes, with three or four Men
in each.</P>
<P>Our Men not being able to &s;peak any Thing
for them to under&s;tand, or to under&s;tand any
Thing they &s;aid, the fir&s;t Thing they did, was,
to make Signs to them, for &s;omething to eat.
<PB N="136" REF="139">
Upon which, three of them &s;eem'd to go away,
and coming again in a few Minutes, brought
with them &s;everal Bundles or Bunches of Roots;
&s;ome Plantanes, and &s;ome green Lemons, or
Limes, and laid down all upon the Shore. Our
Men took Courage then to go on Shore, and
taking up what they brought, they &s;et up a
Stick, and upon the End of it, hung five Bunches
or Strings, of blew and white Beads, and went
on Board again.</P>
<P>Never was such Joy among a wild People
di&s;cover'd, as the&s;e People &s;hew'd, when they
took the Beads off the Stick: They danc'd, and
caper'd, and made a thou&s;and antick Ge&s;tures;
and, inviting our Men on Shore, laid their
Hands upon their Brea&s;ts acro&s;s; and then
look'd up, intimating a &s;olemn Oath, not to hurt
us.</P>
<P>Our Men made Signs, by which they made
them under&s;tand, that they would come again
next Morning, and al&s;o that they &s;hould bring us
more Eatables; accordingly, we &s;ent three Boats
the next Morning, and our Men carried Knives,
Ci&s;&s;ars, Beads, Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, Combs and any
Toys they had, not forgetting Gla&s;s-Beads, and
Gla&s;s-Earings in abundance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> were very ready to meet us, and
brought us Fruits and Herbs as before; but
Three of them, who &s;tood at a Di&s;tance, held
each of them a Creature exactly like a Goat, but
without Horns or Beard; and the&s;e were brought
to Traffick with us.</P>
<P>We brought out our Goods, and offer'd every
One &s;omething, but the Variety was Surprizing to
them, who had never &s;een &s;uch Things before.
But that which was mo&s;t Valuable of all our Things,
<PB N="137" REF="140">
was a Hatchet, which one of their principal
Men took up, and look'd at it, felt of the Edge,
and lay'd it down; then took it up again, and
wanted to know the u&s;e of it: Upon which one
of our Men took it, and &s;tepping to a Tree that
&s;tood near, cut off a &s;mall Bough of it at one
Blow: The Man was Surpriz'd, and run to the
Tree with it, to &s;ee if he could do &s;o too;
and finding the Vertue of it, he lay'd it down,
ran with all his Might into the Country, and
by and by returning, came with two Men more
with him, to &s;hew them this wonderful Thing
call'd a Hatchet.</P>
<P>But if they were Surpriz'd with the Novelty
of a Hatchet, our Men were as much Surpriz'd
to &s;ee hanging round the Ears of both the Men
that he brought with him, large flat pieces of Pure
Gold, and the Thread which they Hung by, was
made of the Hair of the Goats twi&s;ted very pret|tily
together and &s;trong enough.</P>
<P>Our Men offering to Handle them, to &s;ee if
they were Gold, one of the Men takes off his
two Bobs, or what we might call them, and offer|ed
them to our Men for the Hatchet; our Men
&s;eemed to make &s;ome Difficulty of it, as if the
Hatchet was of much greater Value than tho&s;e
Trifles; upon which, he being, as we found, Su|perior,
made the other that came with him, pull
off his two Ear-Jewels al&s;o; and &s;o our unrea&s;o|nable
People took them all Four, being of Pure
Gold, and Weighing together &s;ome Grains above
two Ounces, in Exchange for an old ru&s;ty Hatchet.
Well, however Unrea&s;onable the Price was, they
did not think it &s;o; and &s;o over-fond was he of the
Hatchet, that as &s;oon as he had it for his own,
he run to the Tree, and in a few Minutes had &s;o
<PB N="138" REF="141">
lay'd about him with the Hatchet, that there
was not a Twig left on it that was within his
reach.</P>
<P>This Exchange was a particular Hint to me;
and I pre&s;ently Directed my Chief-Mate, and Cap|tain
<HI>Merlotte,</HI> to go on Shore the next Day, and
acquaint them&s;elves as much as they could with
the Natives, and if po&s;&s;ible, to find out where
they had this Gold, and if any Quantity was to
be found.</P>
<P>They be&s;towed their Time &s;o well, and oblig'd
the Natives &s;o much, by the Toys and Trifles they
gave them, that they pre&s;ently told them that
the Gold, which they call'd <HI>Aarah,</HI> was pick'd
up in the Rivers that came down from a Moun|tain
which they pointed to, a great way off. Our
Men prevailed with three of them, to go with
them to one of the&s;e Rivers, and gave them
Beads and &s;uch Things to encourage them, but by
the way, no Hatchet: That was kept up at a high
Rate, and as a Ra$ity, fit only for a King or &s;ome
Great Man that wore <HI>Aarah</HI> on his Ears.</P>
<P>In a Word, they came to the River, where,
they &s;aid, they found this <HI>Aarah;</HI> and the fir&s;t
Thing our Men ob&s;erv'd there, was an <HI>Indian</HI>
$itting on the Ground, and beating &s;omething
upon a great Stone, with another Stone in his
Hand, for his Hammer: they went to &s;ee what
he was doing, and found, he had found a Lump
of Gold in the Sand, as big as a Swan Shot,
of no regular Shape; but full of Corners,
neither round or &s;quare; and the Man was beat|ing
it flat, as well as he could.</P>
<P>One of our Men, who had a Hatchet in his
Hand, made Signs to him, to let him flat it for
him; and &s;o turning the back Part of the
<PB N="139" REF="142">
Hatchet, which, by the Way, turn'd the Hatch|et
into a Hammer; he beat the Piece of Gold flat
in an In&s;tant; and then turning the Edges, beat
it that Way, 'till he brought it to be round al&s;o.</P>
<P>This was &s;o &s;urprizing to the Man that was
beating, that he &s;tood looking on, with all the
Tokens of Joy and Amazement; and de&s;iring to
&s;ee the Hatchet, look'd this Way and that Way,
upon tho&s;e of his Country Men, who came with
us; as if asking them, if ever they &s;aw the like.</P>
<P>When our Man had done, he made Signs to
know if he had any more <HI>Aarah;</HI> the Man &s;aid
nothing, but went down to the Brink of the
River; and putting his Hand into a Hole, he
brought out three little Lumps of Gold, and a great
many &s;maller, &s;ome of them about as big as a
great Pin's Head; all which he had laid up there,
in the hollow of a pretty big Stone. Our Man
thought it was too much, to take all that for
the Hatchet; and therefore pull'd out &s;ome
Beads, and Pieces of Gla&s;s, and &s;uch Toys; and
in &s;hort, bought all this Cargo of Gold; which,
in the whole, weigh'd near five Ounces, for about
the Value of two Shillings.</P>
<P>Tho' the&s;e Bargains were very agreeable to us,
yet the Di&s;covery of &s;uch a Place, and of &s;uch a
Fund of Trea&s;ure, in a Part of the World,
which, it is very probable, was never &s;een be|fore,
by any <HI>European Eyes,</HI> nor &s;o much as
enquir'd after, was the greate&s;t Satisfaction ima|ginable
to me; knowing the adventurous Tem|per
of the Gentleman, who was our principal
Employer. Upon this Account, while my Men
bu&s;ied them&s;elves in their daily Search after
Gold, and in finding out the Rivers, from
whence it came; or rather where it was found:
<PB N="140" REF="143">
I employ'd my &s;elf to be fully inform'd, where
this Place was; whether it was an I&s;land, or a
Continent; and having found a tolerable good
Road for our Ships to ride in; I caus'd my
two Shallops well mann'd to run along the
Coa&s;t, both <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t,</HI> to find which Way
it lay; and whether they could' find any End of
it; as al&s;o to &s;ee, what Rivers, what People,
and what provi&s;ions, they could meet with.</P>
<P>By my Ob&s;ervation, I found, as above, that we
were in the Latitude of &s;even and twenty De|grees
and thirteen Minutes, <HI>South</HI> Meridian; di|&s;tance
from the <HI>Ladrones</HI> about &s;ixteen Degrees
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI> While my Shallops were gone, I went on
Shore, and &s;ome of my Men &s;et up Tents on
Shore, as well for the Convenience of their Traf|fick,
as for their re&s;ting on Shore all Night;
keeping however, a good Guard, and having two
of our Ship Dogs with them, who never fail'd
giving them Notice, when ever any of the Na|tives
came near them; for what ail'd the Dogs, I
know not, but neither of them could bear the
Sight of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and we had much to do, to
keep them from flying at them.</P>
<P>While we rode here, we had the mo&s;t violent
Storm of Wind, with Rain, and with great Claps,
of Thunder, that we had yet &s;u&s;tain'd, &s;ince we
came out of <HI>England:</HI> It was our Comfort, that
the Wind came of Shore, for it blew at <HI>South,</HI>
and &s;hifting between the S. S. E. and S. W. with
&s;uch exce&s;&s;ive Gu&s;ts, and &s;o furious, and withal,
not only by Squals and &s;udden Flaws, but a
fettled terrible Tempe&s;t; that had it been from
off sea, as it was off Shore, we mu&s;t have peri&s;h'd
there had been no Remedy: And even as it was,
we rode in great Danger. My Boat&s;wain call'd
<PB N="141" REF="144">
twice out to me, to cut my Ma&s;ts by the
Board, prote&s;ting, we &s;hould either bring our
Anchors home, or founder as we rode; and in|deed,
the Sea broke over us many Times, in a
terrible Manner: As I &s;aid before, we had
an indifferent good Road, and &s;o we had, but
not a very good one for the Land was low; and
on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> we lay a little open. However, our
Ground Tackle was good, and our Ship very
tight, xand I told the Boat&s;wain, I would rather
&s;lip the Cable, and go of to Sea, than cut the
Ma&s;ts. However, in about four hours Time more,
we found the Wind abate, but it blew very hard
for three Days after that.</P>
<P>I was in great Pain for my two Shallops in
this Tempe&s;t, but they had both the good Luck
to lie clo&s;e under the Shore; and one indeed had
hauld quite upon the Land, where the Men lay on
Shore under their Sail; &s;o that they got no
Damage; and about three Days after, one of
them return'd, and brought me Word, they had
been, to the <HI>We&s;t</HI> where they had made very little
Di&s;covery, as to the Situation of the Country;
and whether it was an I&s;land, or a Continent;
but they had convers'd with the Natives very
often, and had found &s;everal, that had Pieces of
Gold, hanging &s;ome in their Hair, &s;ome about
their Necks; and they made a &s;hift to bring'as
many with them, as weigh'd, all put together,
&s;eventeen or eighteen Ounces, for which they
had bartere'd Toys and Trifles, as we did; but
they found no Rivers, where they could di&s;|cover
any Gold in the Sands, as we had done,
&s;o that they believ'd, it all came from that Side,
where we were.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="145">
But our other Shallop had much better Luck
&s;he went away to the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and by the Time &s;he
had gone about &s;ixteen Leagues, &s;he found the
Shore break off a little, and &s;oon after, a little
more, 'till at length they came, as it were, to
the Land's End; when, the Shore running due
<HI>South,</HI> they follow'd, according to their Account,
near thirteen Leagues more.</P>
<P>In this Time, they went &s;everal Times on
Shore, entered three Rivers indifferently large,
and one of them very large at the Mouth, but
grew narrow again, in three or four Leauges;
but a deep Channel, with two and twenty to
eight and twenty Fathom Water in it all the
Way, as far as they went.</P>
<P>Here they went on Shore, and traffick'd with
the Natives; who, they found, rude and unpo|li&s;h'd,
but a very mild inoffen&s;ive People; nor
did they find them any thing thievi&s;h, much le&s;s
treacherous; as in &s;ome &s;uch Countries is the
Ca&s;e. They had the good Luck, to find out the
Place, where, as they &s;uppos'd, the King of the
Country re&s;ided; which was a Kind of a City,
incompa&s;s'd with a River, almo&s;t all round; the
River making a Kind of double Hor&s;e &s;hoe. The
Manner of their living is too long to de&s;cribe;
neither could our Men give any Account of their
Government, or of the Cu&s;toms of the Place;
but what they &s;ought for, was Gold and Provi|&s;ions,
and of that they got pretty con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>They found the <HI>Indians</HI> terribly &s;urpriz'd at
the fir&s;t Sight of them; but after &s;ome Time,
they found means to let them know, they de&s;ir'd
a Truce; and to make them under&s;tand, what
they meant by it.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="146">
At length a Truce being e&s;tabli&s;h'd, the King
came, and with him near three hundred Men;
and &s;oon after the Queen, with half as many
Women. They were not &s;tark naked, neither
Men or Women, but wearing a loo&s;e Piece of Cloth
about their Middles; what it was made of, we
could not imagine: For it was neither Linnen or
Woolen, Cotton or Silk; nor was it woven;
but twi&s;ted and breeded by Hand, as our Women
make Bone Lace with Bobbins. It &s;eems it was
the Stalk of an Herb, which this was made with;
and was &s;o &s;trong, that I doubt not, it would
have made Cables for our Ships, if we had
wanted to make &s;uch an Experiment.</P>
<P>When the King fir&s;t came to four Men, they were
a little &s;hy of his Company, he had &s;o many with
him, and they began to retire; which the King
perceiving, he caus'd all his Men to &s;top, and
keep at a Di&s;tance; and advanc'd him&s;elf, with
about ten or twelve of his Men, and no more.</P>
<P>When he was come quite up, our Men, to
&s;hew their Breeding, pull'd off their Hats, but
that he did not under&s;tand; for his Men had no
Hats on. But the Officer making a Bowe to him,
he under&s;tood that pre&s;ently, and bow'd again;
at which all his Men fell down flat upon their
Faces, as flat to the Ground, as if they had been
&s;hot to Death with a Volley of our Shot; and
they did not fall &s;o quick, but they were up
again as nimbly, and then down flat on the
Ground again; and this they did three Times,
their King bowing him&s;elf to our Men, at the
&s;ame Time.</P>
<P>This Ceremony being over, our Men made
Signs to them that they wanted Victuals to Eat,
and &s;omething to Drink; and pull'd out &s;everal
<PB N="144" REF="147">
Things, to let the People &s;ee the wou'd give
&s;omething for what they might bring them.</P>
<P>The King under&s;tood them pre&s;ently, and
turning to &s;ome of his Men, he talk'd a while to
them, and our Men ob&s;erved, that while he &s;poke,
they &s;eemed to be terrified, as if he had been
Threatening them with Death. However, as
&s;oon as he had done, three of them went away,
and our Men &s;uppo&s;ed they went to fetch &s;ome|thing
that the King wou'd give them; upon which,
that they might be before Hand with them, our
Men pre&s;ented his Maje&s;ty with two Pair of
Bracelets of fine Gla&s;s-Beads of &s;everal Colours,
and put them upon his Arms, which he took mo&s;t
kindly; and then they gave him a Knife, with
a good plain Ivory Handle, and &s;ome other odd
Things. Upon receiving the&s;e noble Pre&s;ents,
he &s;ends away another of his Men, and a little
after, two more.</P>
<P>Our Men ob&s;erved, that two of the Men went
a great way off toward the Hill, but the other
Man that he &s;ent away fir&s;t, went to his Queen,
who with her Retinue of Tawny Ladies, &s;tood
but a little way off, and &s;oon after her Maje&s;ty
came with four Women only, attending her.</P>
<P>The Officer who commanded our Men, finding
he &s;hould have another kind of Compliment to
pay the ladies, retired a little; and being an
ingenious handy &s;ort of a Man, in le&s;s than half
an Hour, he, and another of his Men, made a
nice Garland, or rather a Coronet of &s;undry
Strings of Beads, and with Gla&s;s Bobs and Pen|dants,
all hanging about it mo&s;t wonderful gay;
and when the Queen was come, he went up to
the King, and &s;howing, it to him, made Signs that
he would give it to the Queen.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="148">
The King took it; but was &s;o plea&s;ed with it,
that truly he de&s;ired our Officer to put it upon
his own Head, which he did; but when he had
got it upon his own Head, he made bold to let
our Men &s;ee, he was King over his Wife, as
well as over the re&s;t of the Country, and that he
would wear it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>With that our Man pulled out a little Pocket
Looking-Gla&s;s, and holding it up, he let his Ma|je&s;ty
&s;ee his own Face, which we might rea&s;onably
&s;uppo&s;e, he had never &s;een before, e&s;pecially not
with a Crown on his Head too: That till that
Looking-Gla&s;s came, and he &s;aw his own-Face, he
was Grave and Maje&s;tick, and carried it &s;omething
like a King; but he was &s;o ravi&s;hed with this, that
he was quite be&s;ide him&s;elf, and Jump'd and
Caper'd and Danc'd about like a Mad-Man.</P>
<P>All this while, our Men &s;aw nothing coming,
but that all was given on their Side; whereupon
they made Signs again, that they wanted Provi|&s;ions;
He made Signs again, pointing to a Hill a
good way of as if it wou'd come from thence ve|ry
quickly; and then look't to &s;ee if they were
coming, as if he was impatient till they came, as
well as our People.</P>
<P>During this Time, one of our Men ob&s;erv'd,
that the Queen had &s;everal Pieces of Gold, as
they thought them to be, hanging about her,
as particularly in her Hair, and large flat Plats of
Gold upon the hinder part of her Head, &s;ome|thing
in the place of a Roll as our Women wear;
that her Hair was wound about it in Rolls
Breeded together very curiou&s;ly; and having
inform'd our Officer, he made Signs to the King,
for Leave to give the Queen &s;omething, which
he Con&s;ented to. So he went to her Maje&s;ty,
<PB N="146" REF="149">
making a Bowe as before: But this Compli|&s;ance
Surprized her; for upon his Bowing him&s;elf,
on a &s;udden falls the Queen and all her four La|dies
flat on the Ground, but were up again in a
Moment; and our People wondered how they
could throw them&s;elves &s;o flat on their Faces, and
not hurt them&s;elves; nor was it le&s;s to be won|der'd
at, how they could &s;o &s;uddenly jump up
again, for they did not ri&s;e up gradually as we
mu&s;t do, with the Help of our Hands and Knees,
if we were extended &s;o flat on our Faces; but
they, with a Spring, whether with their Hands
or their whole Bodies we know not, jumped up
all at Once, and were upon their Feet imme|diately.</P>
<P>This Compliment over, our Officer &s;tept up
to the Queen, and ties about her Neck, a mo&s;t
delicate Necklace of Pearl; <HI>That is to &s;ay,</HI> of large
hand&s;ome white Gla&s;s Beads, which might in <HI>En|gland,</HI>
co&s;t about Four Pence Halfpenny, and to
every one of her Ladies, he gave another of &s;mal|ler
Beads and differing Colours than tho&s;e which
he gave the Queen: Then he pre&s;ented her Maje&s;|ty
with a long String of Gla&s;s-Beads, which
being put over her Head, reached down to her
Wa&s;te before, and joyn'd in a kind of a To&s;&s;el,
with a little Knot of blew Ribband, which &s;he
was al&s;o extreamly plea&s;ed with; and very fine
&s;he was.</P>
<P>The Queen made, it &s;eems, the fir&s;t Return; for
&s;topping to one of her Women, our Men ob&s;er|ved
that &s;he took &s;omething out of her Hair, and
&s;he let her tye her Hair up again; after which &s;he
brought it, and gave it to our Officer, making
Signs to know if it was acceptable: It was a
Piece of Gold that weighed about two Ounces
<PB N="147" REF="150">
and a half; it had been beaten as flat as they knew
how to beat it. But the Metal was of much
more Beauty to our Men, than the Shape.</P>
<P>Our Officer &s;oon let them &s;ee that he accepted
the Pre&s;ent, by laying it to his Mouth and to his
Brea&s;t, which he found was the Way when they
liked any Thing. In &s;hort, our Officer goes to
Work again, and in a little while, he makes a little
Coronet for the Queen, as he had done before,
tho' le&s;s, and without asking Leave of the King,
went up to her, and put in upon her Head; and
then gave her a little Looking-Gla&s;s, as he had
done to the King, to look at her &s;elf.</P>
<P>She was &s;o Surpriz'd with this, that &s;he knew
not what to do with her &s;elf; but to &s;hew her
Gratitude, &s;he pulled out another Place of Gold
out of her own Hair, and gave it to our Officer;
and not Content with that, &s;he &s;ent one of her
Women to the Crowd of Women that fir&s;t
attended her, and whether &s;he Stript them of
all the Gold they had, we know not, but &s;he
brought &s;o many Pieces, that when our Men
had them (for &s;he gave all to them) they weigh'd
almo&s;t two pound weight.</P>
<P>But this was not all, when &s;he was thus dre&s;t,
up &s;he &s;tept forward, very nimbly and gracefully
towards the King to &s;how him what &s;he had
got; and finding the King, dre&s;s'd up as fine as
her &s;elf, they had Work enough for near two
Hours, to look at one another and admire their
new Ornaments.</P>
<P>Our Men reported, that the King was a Tall
well Shap'd Man, of a very Maje&s;tick Deport|ment,
only that when he laugh'd, he &s;hewed his
Teeth too much, which however, were as white
as Ivory: As for the Queen, &s;aving that her Skin
<PB N="148" REF="151">
was of a Tawny Colour, &s;he was a very pretty
Woman; very Tall, a &s;weet Countenance, admi|rable
Features, and in a Word, a compleatly
hand&s;ome Lady.</P>
<P>She was very odly Dre&s;s'd; &s;he was quite
Naked from her Head to below her Brea&s;ts: Her
Brea&s;ts were plump and round, not flaggy and
hanging down, as it is General with all the
<HI>Indian</HI> Women, &s;ome of who&s;e Brea&s;ts hang as
low as their Bellies; but Sitting as Beautifully
up, as if they had been lac'd up with Stays round
her Body; and below her Brea&s;t, &s;he had a b$oad
piece of a Skin of &s;ome curious Creature, &s;potted
like a Leopard, or rather, as I believe, it was
&s;ome fine &s;potted Deer. This was wrapt round
her very Tight, like a <HI>Body-Girt</HI> to a Hor&s;e; and
under this, &s;he had a kind of Petticoat as before
de&s;crib'd, hanging down to her Ankles. As for
Shoes or Stockings, they were only &s;uch as Na|ture
had furni&s;hed. Her Hair was black, and as
they &s;uppos'd, very long; being wreathed up,
twi&s;ted in long Locks about the Plate of Gold
&s;he wore; and when &s;he pulled off the Plate of
Gold as above, it hung down her Back, and upon
her Shoulders Gracefully enough; but it &s;eems &s;he
did not think &s;o, for as &s;oon as &s;he found it &s;o
fallen down, &s;he cau&s;ed one of her Women to
roll it all up and tye it in a great Knot which hung
down in her Neck, and did not look &s;o well as
when it was loo&s;e.</P>
<P>While the King and the Queen were conver|&s;ing,
together about their fine Things as above,
our Men went back to their Boat where they
left the Purcha&s;e they had got, and furni&s;h'd
them&s;elves with other Things &s;it to Tra&s;&s;ick with,
as they &s;aw Occa&s;ion; and they were not quite
<PB N="149" REF="152">
come up to the King again, when they perceiv'd that
the Men the King had &s;ent up into the Country
were returned; and that they brought with
them a great Quantity of &s;uch Provi&s;ions as they
had; which chiefly Con&s;i&s;ted in Roots and <HI>Maiz</HI> or
<HI>Indian</HI> Corn, and &s;everal Fruits which we had
never &s;een before: Some of them re&s;embled the
large <HI>Europian</HI> Figs, but were not really Figs;
with &s;ome great Jars of Water, having Herbs
&s;teeped in it, and Roots, that made it look as
white as Milk, and drank like Milk &s;weetned
with Sugar, but more Delicious, and exceeding
Cool and Refre&s;hing. They brought al&s;o a great
Quantity of Oranges, but they were neither
Sweet nor Sour, and our Men believed they
were not ripe; But when they were Dre&s;t,
after the Manner of the Country, which they
&s;hew'd our Men how to do, <HI>That is to &s;ay,</HI> to roa&s;t
them in the Fire, they eat admirably well, and
our Men brought a great many away to us, and
when we roa&s;ted them, they exceeded all that
ever I ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>After our Men had received what they brought,
and &s;hewn that they were acceptable to them,
the King made Signs that he wou'd be gone, but
wou'd come again to them the next Morning; and
pointing to the Queen's Head, where the Plate
of Gold had been, that &s;he gave to our Men, inti|mated,
that he would bring &s;ome of that with him
the next Day. But while he was making the&s;e
Signs, one of his other Me&s;&s;engers came back and
gave the King &s;omething into his Hand, wrapt
up, which our Men could not &s;ee: As &s;oon as the
King had it, as if he had been proud to &s;how
our Men that he could make him&s;elf and his
Queen as &s;ine as they could make him, he pull'd
<PB N="150" REF="153">
it out, and fir&s;t put it on his Queen (a &s;hort
Thing like a Robe) which reached from her Neck,
<HI>for he put it over her Head,</HI> only down to the &s;pot|ed
Skin which &s;he wore before; and &s;o it covered
her Shoulders and Brea&s;t. It was made of an in|finite
Number and Variety of Feathers, odly,
and yet very curiou&s;ly put together; and was
Spangl'd, as we may call it, all over, with little
Drops or Lumps of Gold; &s;ome no bigger than a
Pins-Head, which had Holes made thro' them,
end were &s;trung Six or Seven together, and &s;o
Tyed on to the Feathers: Some as big as a Large
Pea, hanging &s;ingle, &s;ome as big as a Hor&s;e-Bean,
and beaten Flat, and all hanging promi&s;cuou&s;ly
among the Feathers, without any Order or Shape,
which notwith&s;tanding were very Beautiful in the
Whole, and made the Thing look Rich and Hand|&s;ome
enough.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he had thus Equipt his Queen, he
put the other on upon him&s;elf, which as it was
larger, &s;o it had a Particular in its Shape; namely,
that it covered his Arms almo&s;t to his Elbows,
and was &s;o made, that it came round under the
Arm, and being fa&s;tned there with a String, made
a kind of Sleeve.</P>
<P>As the King's Robe, or what ever it may be
called, was larger, (for it came down to his Wa&s;te)
&s;o it had a great deal more Gold about it, and
larger Pieces than what the Queen wore: When
their Maje&s;ties had thus put on their Robes, you
may gue&s;s how Glorious they look'd, but e&s;pe|cially
the Queen, who being a mo&s;t charming
beautiful Creatureas before, was much more &s;o.
When &s;he glitter'd thus all with Gold; our
Men look'd very narrowly to ob&s;erve whether
there were no Diamonds, and particularly whe|ther
<PB N="151" REF="154">
any Pearl among their Finery, but they
could not perceive any.</P>
<P>In this manner they parted for that Evening;
but the People did not leave them &s;o, for they
throng'd about them; and &s;ome brought them Jars
of the white Liquor, &s;ome brought them Roots,
&s;o me Fruits, &s;ome one Thing &s;ome another; and
our Men gave every one of them &s;ome &s;mall Mat|ter
or other in Proportion to what they brought.
At la&s;t, there came four particular tall lu&s;ty Men,
with Bows and Arrows, but before they came
clo&s;e up to our Men, they laid down their Bows and
Arrows on the Ground, and came forward with all
The Tokens of Friend&s;hip, they wereable to make.</P>
<P>They had two Youths with them, each of
which led a tame Fawn of pretty large Growth;
and when the Men came up, they gave the two
Fawns to our Men; who, in Return, gave them,
each of them, a Knife, and &s;ome Strings of Beads,
and &s;uch Toys as they had.</P>
<P>Our Men ob&s;erv'd, that all the&s;e Men had
little Bits of Gold, &s;ome of one Shape, and &s;ome
of another, hanging at their Ears; and when
our Men came to be familiar, they ask'd them as
well as they could, where they found that Stuff,
and they made Signs to the Sand in the River;
and then pointed towards that Part of the
Country, where our Ships lay; which &s;igni$ied
to our Men, that the Gold was, mo&s;t of it,
where we lay, not there, where the King and
Queen re&s;ided. Nay, when our Men pointed
again to the River where they wore, and went
and took up &s;ome of the Sand, as if they would
look for Gold in it, they made Signs of laughing
at it, and that there was nothing to be found
there, but that it lay all the other Way.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="155">
And yet two or three of the Men, who, when
the Tide was out, went up the Bank of the
River, two or three Mile upon the Sands, peep|ing
and trying the Sands as they went; found
three or four little Bits of pure Gold in the
Sands, tho' not bigger than Pins Heads; but no
doubt, farther up the Country, they might have
found more.</P>
<P>The&s;e four Men &s;eeing how fond our People
were of the Gold, made Signs, that they could
fetch Gold to them, if they would give them
&s;uch Things as they lik'd; and ours again told
them, they &s;hould have any Thing they pleas'd;
and, as Earne&s;t, gave them &s;ome Peices of Iron,
and Bits of Gla&s;s of &s;mall Value, both which
they were much delighted with, before Hand.</P>
<P>Early in the Morning, their four Cu&s;tomers
came again, and brought &s;everal Men, who
&s;eem'd to be Servants, along with them, loaden
with Refre&s;hments; &s;uch as the white Water,
mention'd above; which they brought in earthen
Pots very hard, but made &s;o by the Sun, not by any
other Fire. They brought al&s;o three &s;mall Deer
with them, and a Kind of Coney or Rabbit, but
larger; which our Men were very glad of. But
that which was above all the re&s;t, they brought
a good Quantity of Gold Du&s;t, that is to &s;ay,
&s;ome in &s;mall Lumps, &s;ome in bigger; and one
of them had near a Pound weight, wrap'd up in
a piece of Coney Skin, which was all &s;o very
&s;mall, that it was like Du&s;t; which, as our Men
under&s;tood afterwards, was reckon'ed little worth,
becau&s;e all the bigger Lumps had been pick'd out
of it.</P>
<P>Our Men, you mu&s;t be &s;ure, were very wil|ling
to trade for this Commodity, and therefore
<PB N="153" REF="156">
they brought out great Variety of Things to
truck with them; making Signs to them, to pick
out what they lik'd; but &s;till keeping a Re&s;erve
for the King and Queen, who they expected.
Above all, they had made a Re&s;erve for the King,
of &s;ome extraordinary Hatchets which they had
not yet &s;uffer'd to be &s;een; with a Hammer or
two, and &s;ome drinking Gla&s;&s;es, and the like,
with &s;ome particular Toys for the Queen.</P>
<P>But they had Variety enough, (be&s;ides this) for
the four Men; who, in &s;hort, bought &s;o many
Trinkets and Trifles, that our Men not only got
all the Gold they brought, but the very Pieces of
Gold out of their Ears; in Return for which,
our Men gave them every one a Pair of Ear
Rings, to hang about their Ears, with a fine
Drop; &s;ome of green Gla&s;s, &s;ome red, &s;ome
blew; and they were wonderfully pleas'd with
the Exchange; and went back, we may venture
to &s;ay, much richer than they came.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the&s;e had done their Market,
and indeed a little before, they perceiv'd at a
Di&s;tance, the King and the Queen, coming
with a great Retinue; &s;o they made Signs to our
Men, that they mu&s;t be gone; and that they
would not have the King know, that they had
been there.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the Relation of all this made
me very much repent, that I had not happen'd
to have put in there with the Ships; tho' indeed
as the Road lay open to the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>South</HI>
Winds, it might have been wor&s;e another Way;
I mean, when the Storm blew. However as it is,
I mu&s;t report this Fart, from the Account given
us by my Men.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="157">
When the King and Queen came the
&s;econd Time, they came together, and dre&s;s'd
up, as our Men &s;uppos'd, with the utmo&s;t Mag|nificence;
having the fine feather'd &s;pangl'd
Things about their Shoulders; and the King had
over all his Habit, a fine &s;potted Robe of Deer
Skins, neatly joyn'd together; and which, as he
manag'd it, cover'd him from Head to Foot;
and in &s;hort, it was &s;o very beautiful, that he
really look'd like a King with it.</P>
<P>When he came to our Men, and the Ceremony
of their meeting was over, the King, turning
round, &s;hewed them, that he had brought them
Stores of Provi&s;ions; and indeed &s;o he had; for
he had at lea&s;t fifty Men attending him, loaden
with Roots, and Oranges, and <HI>Maiz,</HI> and &s;uch
Things; in &s;hort he brought them above twenty
thou&s;and Oranges; a great Parcel of that Fruit
like a Fig, which I mention'd above, and other
Fruits. After which another Party follow'd, and
brought twenty live Deer; and as many of their
Rabbits dead; the latter are as big as our Hares.</P>
<P>As they came up, the King made Signs to our
Men to take them; and our Officer making Signs
to thank his Maje&s;ty, he orders one of the
Queen's Attendants, to give him one of the fea|ther'd
Robes, &s;uch a one, as the King him&s;elf
had on; and made mighty fine with Lumps and
To&s;&s;els of Gold, as the other. And the tawny
La&s;s advancing to him, offer'd to put it over his
Head; but he took it in his Hand, and put it
on him&s;elf; and look'd as like a Jack Pudding in
it, as any one could de&s;ire; for it made no
Figure at all upon him, compar'd to what it did
upon the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="158">
When they had receiv'd all this, they could
not but make a &s;uitable Return; and therefore
our Officer caus'd his Re&s;erve to be brought out;
and fir&s;t he gave his Maje&s;ty, a Dozen of very
hand&s;ome drinking Gla&s;&s;es of &s;everal Sizes; with
half a Dozen gla&s;s Beekers, or Cups, to the
Queen, for the fame U&s;e. Then he gave the
King a little Hanger, and a Belt to wear it by
his Side; and &s;hew'd him, how to buckle it on,
and take it off; and how to draw it out, and put
it in again.</P>
<P>This was &s;uch a Pre&s;ent, and the King was &s;o
delighted with it, that our Officer &s;aid, he be|lieved
the King for two Hours together, did
nothing but draw it and put it up again, put it on,
and pull it off, and the like.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, he gave the King three Hatchets;
and &s;hew'd them the U&s;es of them; al&s;o two large
Hammers and a pair of very &s;trong large Sheers,
particularly &s;howing him, that with tho&s;e Ham|mers,
they might beat out the Gold Lumps
which they found in the Rivers, and with the
Sheers might cut the Edges round, or into what
Shape they pleas'd, when they were beaten thin.</P>
<P>To the Queen he gave &s;ix little Knives, and a
dozen &s;mall Looking-Gla&s;&s;es for her Ladies. Six
pair of Ci&s;ars, and a &s;mall Box full of large
Needles; then he gave her &s;ome cour&s;e brown
Thread, and &s;how'd her how to thred the Needle
and &s;ow any Thing together with the Thread;
all which &s;he admired exceedingly, and call'd her
Tawny Maids of Honour about her, that they
might learn al&s;o. And whil$t they were &s;tanding
all together, our Officer (to make the King
Laugh) Sewed two of her Women one to ano|ther
by the Lap of their Wa&s;t$coats, or what el&s;e
<PB N="156" REF="159">
it might be called; and when they were a little
Surpriz'd at it, and began (as he thought) to be a
little Unea&s;y, he took the Ci&s;&s;ars, and at one
Snap, &s;et them at Liberty again: Which pa&s;s'd
for &s;uch an extraordinary Piece of Dexterity,
that the King wou'd needs have two of them
Sew'd together again, on purpo&s;e to &s;ee it Cut
again: And then the King de&s;ired he might have
a Needle and Thread him&s;elf, and a pair of
Ci&s;&s;ars: Then he wou'd Sew &s;ome things together
and Cut them a&s;under again &s;everal Times, and
Laugh mo&s;t heartily at the Ingenuity of it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Things, they gave her Maje&s;ty a
pair of Ear-Rings to hang on her Ears, the Gla&s;s
in them looking Green like an Emrald; a Ring of
Silver with fal&s;e Stones in it, like a Ro&s;e Diamond
Ring, the Middle Stone red like a Ruby; which
&s;he went pre&s;ently and gave to the King; but our
Officer made Signs that he had one that was bigger
for the King, and accordingly gave the King
one much larger: And now they had done giv|ing
Pre&s;ents, as they thought, when the King
made a Sign to the Queen, which &s;he under|&s;tood,
and calling one of her Women, &s;he brought
a &s;mall parcel, which the Queen gave our Officer
into his Hand; wherein was about Eleven pound
Weight of Gold-Du&s;t, but as before, no big
Lumps in it.</P>
<P>Our Men having thus fini&s;h'd their Traffick, and
being about to come away, they made Signs
to the King, that they wou'd come again and
bring him more &s;ine Things; at which the King
Smiles, and pointed to the Gold, as if telling them
he wou'd have more of that for them when they
came again.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="160">
Our Men had now their Expectations fully
an&s;wer'd; and, as I &s;aid, had ended their Traffick;
and taking Leave of the King, and all his Retinue,
retired to their Shallop, the King and Queen
going away to their City as above; the
Wind blowing <HI>Northerly,</HI> they were &s;even Days
before they got down to us in the Ship; during
which time, they had almo&s;t Fami&s;h'd the Deer
they had left; Five of which they had kept to
bring us alive, and yet they went two or three
times on Shore to get Food for them by the
way.</P>
<P>We were all glad to &s;ee them again, and I had
a great deal of Rea&s;on to be very well &s;atisfied
with the Account of their Traffick, tho' not much
with their Di&s;covery, for they were not able to
give us the lea&s;t Account whether that Land was
a Continent or an I&s;land.</P>
<P>But let that be how it will, 'tis certainly a
Country yet Unfrequented by any of the Chri&s;tian
part of Mankind, and perhaps may ever be &s;o,
and yet may be as rich as any other part of the
World yet di&s;cover'd. The Mountains in mo&s;t
of the I&s;lands, as well as of the main Land in tho&s;e
Parts abounding in Gold or Silver, and no que&s;ti|on,
as well worth &s;earching after, as the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Guinea;</HI> where, tho' the Quantity they find
is con&s;iderable, yet, it is at this Time &s;ought after
by &s;o many, and the Negroes taught &s;o well
how to Value it, that but a little is brought
away at a Time, and &s;o much given for it, that
Computing the Charge of the Voyage, is often
times more than it is worth.</P>
<P>Whereas tho' it is true, that what Gold is found
here is a great way off; yet, I am per&s;uaded,
&s;uch Quantities are to be had, and the Price given
<PB N="158" REF="161">
for it &s;o very Trifling, that it wou'd be well
worth &s;earching for.</P>
<P>I reckon, that including the Gold our Shallop
brought and what we goton <HI>Shore</HI> where we lay, we
brought away about twenty four pound Weight
of Gold: The Expence of which, we could not
Value at above ten or eleven Pound in <HI>England</HI>
put it all together; and reckoning for all the
Provi&s;ions we got there, which &s;upply'd us for
twenty Days after we came away.</P>
<P>For while our Shallop was making her Vi&s;it
thus to the Royal Family, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as is related;
our Men were not Idle on Shore, but partly by
Trade with the Natives, and by Wa&s;hing the
Sands in the &s;mall Rivers, we got &s;uch a Quantity
of Gold, as well Satisfied us for the Stay we made.</P>
<P>We had been about eighteen Days here when
our Shallop returned, and we &s;tay'd a Week
more Trafficking with the People: And I am
per&s;uaded, if we had a mind to have &s;ettled
there and &s;tay'd till now, we &s;hould have been
very Welcome to the People. We &s;aw neither
Hor&s;e or Cow, Mule, A&s;s, Dog or Cat, or any
of our <HI>European</HI> &s;ort of Creatures (except that our
Men &s;hot &s;ome Wild-Ducks and Wigeon exactly
the &s;ame which we &s;ee in <HI>England,</HI> and very Fat
and Good, but much ea&s;ier to &s;hoot than in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
having never been acquainted with the Fla&s;h
and Noi&s;e of Guns as ours have been: We al&s;o
found a Sort of Patridges in the Country not
much unlike our own, and a great many of the
Whi&s;tling Plover the &s;ame with Ours.</P>
<P>Tho' this Months Stay was Unexpected, yet,
we had no Rea&s;on to think our Time ill &s;pent.
However, we did not think we ought to lie
here too long what ever we got: So we Weigh'd
<PB N="159" REF="162">
and &s;tood off to Sea, &s;teering &s;till <HI>S. E.</HI> keeping
the Shore of this Golden Country in Sight, till our
Men told us they found the Land fall off to the
<HI>South:</HI> Then we Steer'd away more <HI>Southerly</HI> for
&s;ix or eight Days, not lo&s;ing Sight of Land all the
Time, till by an Ob&s;ervation, we found we were
in the Latitude of thirty four Degrees and a Half,
<HI>South</HI> of the Line; our Meridian di&s;tance from the
<HI>Ladrones,</HI> twenty two Degrees thirty Minutes <HI>Ea&s;t;</HI>
when a fre&s;h Gale of Wind &s;pringing up at <HI>South</HI>
and by <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> oblig'd us to Hale Clo&s;e for that
Evening; at Night it blew &s;uch a Storm, that
we were oblig'd to yield to the Force of it,
and go away afore it to the <HI>N.</HI> or <HI>N.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> till
we came to the point of that Land we pa&s;t before;
here the Land tending to the <HI>We&s;t</HI> we run in
under the Lee of a &s;teep Shore, and came to an
Anchor in twenty five Fathom Water, being the
&s;ame Country we were in before. Here we rid
very &s;afe for five Days, the Wind continuing to
blow very hard all the Time from the <HI>South Ea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>My Men would fain have had me gone a Shore
again, and traffick'd with the People for more Gold;
but I, who was &s;till in que&s;t of farther Di&s;cove|ries,
thought, I knew enough of this Place, to
tempt my Friend, the Merchant, who&s;e favou|rite
De&s;ign was that of making new Di&s;coveries,
to another Voyage there; and that was enough for
me. So I declin'd going on Shore again, except,
that we &s;ent our Boats for a Recruit of fre&s;h
Water; and our Men, while they were filling it,
&s;hot a Brace of Deer, as they were feeding by the
Side of a &s;wamp or moi&s;t Ground; and al&s;o
&s;ome wild Ducks. Here we &s;et up a great wood|en
Cro&s;s, and wrote on it, the Names of our
Ships, and Commanders; and the Time that we
came to an Anchor there.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="163">
But we were oblig'd to a farther Di&s;covery
of this Country than we intended, by the fol|lowing
Accident: We had unmoor'd early in
the Morning, and by eight a Clock were un|der
Sail; by ten we had doubled the Point I
mentioned above, and &s;tood away S. keeping the
Shore on Board, at the Di&s;tance of about two
Leagues <HI>We&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day, the Officer, who had been
with the Shallop, &s;hew'd us the Opening or
Mouth where he put in, and where he had
made his Traffick with the King of the Coun|try,
as you have heard.</P>
<P>We went on &s;till for two Days, and &s;till we
found the Land extending it &s;elf <HI>South</HI> till the third
Day in the Morning, we were a little &s;urpriz'd to
find our &s;elves, as it were, embay'd; being in the
Bottom of a deep Gulph, and the Land ap|pearing
right a Head, Di&s;tance about three
Leagues; the Coa&s;t having turn'd away to the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>
and by <HI>South,</HI> very high Land and Mountainous;
and the Tops of &s;ome of the Hills cover'd with
Snow.</P>
<P>Our &s;econd Mate and the Boat&s;wain, upon
this Di&s;covery, were for coming about, and &s;ent
to me for Orders to make Signals to the other
Ship and our Brigantine, who were both a|Head,
to do the like; but I, who was willing
to acquaint my &s;elf, as fully as I could, with
the Coa&s;t of the Country, which I made no
Que&s;tion I &s;hould have Occa&s;ion to come to
again, &s;aid, NO NO, I will &s;ee a little far|ther
fir&s;t. So I run on, having an ea&s;y Gale
at N. E. and good Weather, till I came within
about League and a Half of the Shore, when
I found, that in the very Bite or Nook of the
<PB N="161" REF="164">
Bay, there was a great Inlet of Water, which
either mu&s;t be a Pa&s;&s;age or Streight between the
Land we had been on Shore upon; which in
that Ca&s;e, mu&s;t be a great I&s;land, or that it mu&s;t
be the Mouth of &s;ome extraordinary great Ri|ver.</P>
<P>This was a Di&s;covery too great to be omit|ted,
&s;o I order'd the Brigantine to &s;tand in
with an ea&s;y Sail, and &s;ee what Account could
be had of the Place; Accordingly they &s;tood in,
and we follow'd about a League, and then lay
by, waiting their Signals. I had particularly
ordered them to keep two Boats a Head to
&s;ound the Depth all the Way, and they did &s;o;
and how it happen'd, we know not, but on a
&s;udden, we heard the Sloop fire two Guns fir&s;t,
and then one Gun; the fir&s;t was a Signal to
us to bring too, and come no farther; the next
was a Signal of Di&s;tre&s;s; we immediately tack'd
to &s;tand off, but found a &s;trong Current &s;etting
directly into the Bite, and there not being Wind
enough for us to &s;tem the Current, we let go
our Anchors in twenty two Fathom Water.</P>
<P>Immediately we mann'd out all the Boats we
had, great and &s;mall, to go and a&s;&s;i&s;t our Bri|gantine,
not knowing what Di&s;tre&s;s &s;he might
be in; and they found &s;he had driven up, as we
were like to have done too far into the Channel
of a large River, the Mouth of which, being
very broad, had &s;everal Shoals in it; and tho'
&s;he had drop'd her Anchor ju&s;t upon Noticewhich
the Boats who were Sounding, gave her; yet &s;he
tayl'd a-Ground upon a Sand, and &s;tuck fa&s;t;
our Men made no Doubt but &s;he would be lo&s;t,
and began to think of &s;aving the Provi&s;ions and
Ammunition out of her. The two Long-Boats
<PB N="162" REF="165">
accordingly began to lighten her; and fir&s;t they
took in her Guns, and let out all her Casks of
Water; then they began to take in her great
Shot and the heavy Goods. But by this Time,
they found their Mi&s;take, for the Current,
which I mention'd, was nothing, but a &s;trong
Tide of Flood; which, the Indraught of the
River being very great, ran up with a very great
Force; and, in &s;omething le&s;s than an Hour, the
Brigantine fleeted again.</P>
<P>However &s;he &s;tuck &s;o long upon the Sand, and
the Force of the Current or Tide was &s;o great,
that &s;he receiv'd con&s;iderable Damage; and had
a great deal of Water in her Hold. I immediately
order'd our Boats to row to the Land, on both
Sides, to &s;ee, if they could find a good Place to
lay her on Shore in; they did &s;o, and found a
very convenient Harbour, in the Mouth of a
&s;mall River; which empty'd it &s;elf into the
great River, about two Leagues within the fore|land
of it, on the <HI>North</HI> Side; as the River <HI>Med|way</HI>
runs into the <HI>Thames,</HI> within the Mouth of it,
on the <HI>South</HI> Side; only this was not &s;o far up.</P>
<P>Here they ran in the Sloop immediately, and
the next Day we came thither al&s;o; our Boats
having &s;ounded the whole Breadth of the main Ri|ver,
and found a very good Channel, half a League
broad; having from &s;eventeen to four and
twenty Fathom Water all the Way, and very
good riding.</P>
<P>Here we found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to take
every Thing out of the Brigantine, to &s;earch her
Bottom; for her lying on Shore had &s;train'd her
Seams, and broke one of her Floor Timbers;
and having Hands enough, our Men unloaded
her in a very little Time, and making a little
<PB N="163" REF="166">
Dock for her, mended all the Damage in about
ten Days Time. But &s;eeing her in &s;o good a Con|dition,
and the Place &s;o convenient, I re&s;olv'd to
have her whole Bottom new calk'd and payd; &s;o
we made her as clean as &s;he was when &s;he fir&s;t
came off the Stocks.</P>
<P>This I took for a good Opportunity, to ca|reen
and clean our other Ships too; for we had
done little to them &s;ince we came from <HI>Mada|ga&s;car.</HI>
We found our <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship much
Worm eaten in her &s;heathing, which we help'd
as well as we could, by new nailing, and by
taking out &s;ome Pieces of her &s;heathing, and
putting new ones in. But as to our great Ship,
&s;he was &s;heath'd with Lead, and &s;o had receiv'd
no Damage at all; only that &s;he was very foul,
which we remedied by &s;craping and cleaning,
and new graving her quite over.</P>
<P>We were not all employ'd in this Work, and
therefore we had Lei&s;ure to make the be&s;t of our
Time, for the main Work of new Di&s;coveries.
And now I re&s;olv'd to leave it no more to under
Officers, as I had done before, <HI>viz.</HI> when I gave the
Command of the Shallop, that traded with the
King and Queen, as above, to a Mid&s;hip Man,
which I was very &s;orry for, tho' the Fellow did
his Bu&s;ine&s;s very well too; but I &s;ay, I re&s;olv'd
not to tru&s;t any one now, but my &s;elf.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, I took the two Shallops,
and went cro&s;s the mouth of the great River, to
the <HI>South</HI> Shore, to &s;ee what Kind of a Country
was to be found there. For, as to the <HI>North</HI>
Side where we were, we found it to be much
the &s;ame, with that Part where we had been
before; only that we found no Gold, nor did
we perceive, that the People had any.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="167">
I found the Mouth of this River or Inlet, to
be about four Leagues over, where I cro&s;s'd it,
which was about three Leagues and a half within
the Inlet it &s;elf. But the Weather being very
calm, and the Flood Tide running &s;harp, we let
our Boat drive up in our cro&s;&s;ing, about two
Leagues more; and we found the Channel grew
narrow &s;o fa&s;t, that where we came to Land, it
was not full a League over; that about three
Leagues farther, we found it a meer River, not
above as broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Blackwall.</HI></P>
<P>We found it a &s;tleep Shore, and ob&s;erving a
little Creek very convenient for our Purpo&s;e,
we ran in our Boats among &s;ome Flags or Ru&s;hes;
and lay'd them as &s;oft and as &s;afe, as if they had
been in a Dock; we went all on Shore immedi|ately,
except two Men in each Boat, left to
guard our Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>We had for Arms, every Man a Mu&s;quet, a
Pi&s;tol, and a Cutla&s;s; and in each Boat we had
&s;ix half Pikes to u&s;e, as we might have Occa&s;ion.
We had al&s;o every Man a Hatchet, hung in a
little Frog at his Belt; and in each Boat a broad
Ax and a Saw.</P>
<P>We were furni&s;h'd with Strings of Beads, Bits
of Gla&s;s, Gla&s;s Rings, Earings, Pearl Necklaces,
and &s;uch like Jewelry Ware, innumerable; be&s;ides
Knives, Ci&s;&s;ars, Needles, Pins, Looking-gla&s;&s;es,
Drinking-gla&s;&s;es, and Toys great Store.</P>
<P>We were no &s;ooner on Shore, but we found
People in Abundance; For there were two or
three &s;mall Towns within a little Way of the
Shore; and I &s;uppo&s;e, we might have the more
People about us, becau&s;e, as we under&s;tood after|wards,
they had &s;een us before, tho' we had not
&s;een them.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="168">
We made Signs to them, by putting our Fin|gers
to our Mouths, and moving our Chops, as
if we were eating, that we wanted Provi&s;ions;
and we hung up a white Flag for a Truce. They
pre&s;ently under&s;tood the fir&s;t Signal, but knew
nothing of the la&s;t; and as to Provi&s;ions, ju&s;t as
had been the Ca&s;e before, they brought us out
Roots, and Fruits, &s;uch as they eat them&s;elves;
but &s;uch as we had never &s;een before. Some of
them, however, were very &s;weet and good, and
when we boy'ld them, they eat much like an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Par&s;nip; and we gave them Strings of
Beads, Pieces of Gla&s;s, and &s;uch Things as we
found, they were always very fond of.</P>
<P>We found the People, as I ob&s;erv'd of the
other, very inoffen&s;ive and &s;incere; not quarrel|&s;ome,
nor treacherous, or mi&s;chievous in the
lea&s;t. And we took Care, not &s;o much as to let
them know the U&s;e, or Manner of our Fire
Arms a great while; neither was there one Piece
fir'd, all the Time we were among the other
People, where we had &s;o much Gold: If there
had, it had been very probable, that they would
have fled the Country, in &s;pight of all the
good U&s;age we could have been able to have
&s;hewn them.</P>
<P>The People, where we were now, were
not &s;o rich in Gold, as the&s;e where we were
before; But we found them much better &s;tor'd
with Provi&s;ions; for be&s;ides Deer, of which they
had great Plenty and Variety, for they had &s;ome
of a Sort, which I had never &s;een before, and
be&s;ides an infinite Number of tho&s;e Rabbits,
which I mention'd before, which were as big as
our Hares, and which do not burrough in the
Ground, as our Conies do; they had a Kind of
<PB N="166" REF="169">
Sheep, large, (like tho&s;e of <HI>Peru,</HI> where they are
us'd to carry Burthens;) and very good. They have
no Wool nor Horns, but are rather hairy, like a
Goat; nor &s;hould I call them Sheep, but that
their Fle&s;h eats like Mutton; and I know not
what el&s;e to call them. The Natives call'd them
<HI>Hutta&s;h;</HI> but what Breed, or from what Part of
the World, or whether created for a Peculiar to
this Part, I know not.</P>
<P>However, their Fle&s;h was very agreeable, and
they were fat and good; and as the <HI>Indians</HI> were
mightily pleas'd with the Price we paid them,
and the Goods we paid them in, they brought
us more of the&s;e <HI>Hutta&s;hes</HI> than we knew what to
do with; and as I can calculate the Rate, I
&s;uppo&s;e, we might have them for about eight
Pence, or &s;ometimes, not above &s;ix Pence co&s;t each;
for they would give us one very thankfully, for a
String or two of &s;mall Beads, and think them|&s;elves
mighty well paid.</P>
<P>I found them &s;o plentiful, and &s;o ea&s;y to come
at, that in &s;hort, I &s;ent fifty of them alive ty'd
Neck and Heels, in one of the Shallops back to
our Ships; and order'd them to &s;end their long
Boats over for more; for tho' it was &s;o little a
Way over, we did not find, they had any of
them on that Side the River.</P>
<P>We did the <HI>Indians</HI> another Piece of Service;
for if they gave us Meat, we taught them to be
Cooks; for we &s;hew'd them how to roa&s;t it upon
a Stick or Spit before the Fire; whereas they eat
all their Meat before, either &s;tew'd in earthen
Pots over the Fire, with Herbs, &s;uch as we did
not under&s;tand, or thrown on the Coals of green
Wood into the Fire; which, by the Way,
always made it &s;tink of the Smoak mo&s;t intolerably.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="170">
We had a great deal of Opportunity now, to
conver&s;e with the People on both Sides the
River; and we found them to be not only
different Nations, but of a differing Speech and
differing Cu&s;toms. The&s;e on the <HI>South</HI> Side, where
I now was, &s;eem'd to be the be&s;t furni&s;h'd with
Provi&s;ions, and to live in the greate&s;t Plenty.
But tho&s;e, on the <HI>North</HI> Side, appear'd better
cloath'd, and a more civiliz'd Sort of People; and
of the two &s;eem'd to have, in their Countenances,
&s;omething the more agreeable.</P>
<P>However, as they were near Neighbours, for
the River only parted them, they were not very
much unlike neither. That which &s;eem'd mo&s;t
&s;trange to me, was, that we found they had
little Knowledge or Communication one with
another. They had indeed &s;ome Boats in the
River, but they were but &s;mall, and rather &s;erv'd
to ju&s;t wa&s;t them over, or to fi&s;h in them, than for
any Carriage; for we found none that could
carry above four Men, and the&s;e very odly
made; partly as a Canoe, by hollowing a Tree,
and partly by Skins of Bea&s;ts, dry'd and &s;tuck on
&s;o, as they made wa&s;t Cloths to the other; yet
they would paddle along at a great Rate with
them.</P>
<P>For want of under&s;tanding their Language, I
could come at no Knowledge of their Religion or
Wor&s;hip; nor did I &s;ee any Idols among them, or
any Wor&s;hipping of the Sun or Moon. But yet,
as a Confirmation that all Nations, however Bar|barous,
have &s;ome Notion of a GOD, and &s;ome
Awe of a Superior Power: So I ob&s;erv'd here,
that being making a Bargain with one of the prin|cipal
Men, &s;uch I perceiv'd him to be by the
Re&s;pect the re&s;t &s;hew'd him; I &s;ay, being making
<PB N="168" REF="171">
a Bargain with him as well as could be done
between People that under&s;tood not one Word
of what either of us &s;aid, he had made Signs
to bring me twelve Sheep the next Morning,
for &s;ome Things that I was to deliver him of mine.
I am &s;ure the Goods were not all of them of Value
&s;ufficient to give me the lea&s;t Di&s;tru&s;t, but when
I gave him the Goods without the Sheep, being
as I &s;aid to tru&s;t him till next Day, he call'd
two Men to him, and pointing to the Goods that
I had put into his Hands, he tells upon his Fingers
Twelve; letting them know (as I &s;uppo&s;e) that
he was to give me twelve Sheep the next Day.
&s;o far it &s;eems they were to be Witne&s;&s;es of the
Agreement: Then he places his two Hands one
upon each Brea&s;t turn'd very accurately with the
Fingers up towards his Face, and holding them
there, he looks towards Heaven, with his Face
turn'd upward and with the mo&s;t Gravity, Seri|ou&s;ne&s;s,
and Solemnity in his Countenance, that
ever I &s;aw in any Mans Face in my Life. When he
had continued in this Po&s;ture about a quarter of a
Minute, he takes the two Men, and puts them ju&s;t
in the &s;ame Po&s;ture; and then points to me, and
then to him&s;elf, by which I under&s;tood, fir&s;t, that
he &s;olemnly &s;wore to me, that he wou'd bring the
Sheep punctually and faithfully to me, and then he
brought the two Men to be Bail or Security for the
Performance; <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> to oblige them&s;elves
to perform it, if he did not.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, tho&s;e People who have any Notion
of a GOD, mu&s;t repre&s;ent Him to them&s;elves
as &s;omething Superior, and &s;omething that &s;ees
and hears and knows what they &s;ay or do. Whe|ther
the&s;e People meant the Sun or the Moon, or
the Stars, or what el&s;e I do not Determine for
<PB N="169" REF="172">
them, but 'tis Vi&s;ible they under&s;tood it to be
&s;omething to &s;wear by; &s;omething that could
bear Witne&s;s of their Engagement, and that be|ing
called to Witne&s;s of it, could re&s;ent the
Breach of Promi&s;e. As to tho&s;e, who&s;e Gods are
Mon&s;ters, and hideous Shapes, frightful Images
and terrible Figures, the Motive of their Adora|tion
being that of meer Terror, they have cer|tainly
gro&s;s Ideas. But the&s;e People &s;eem to act
upon a more &s;olid Foundation, paying their
Reverence in amanner much more Rational, and
to &s;omething which it was much more rea&s;onable
to Wor&s;hip; this appear'd in the Solemnity of
their Countenances, and their Behaviour in making
a &s;olemn Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>We found tho&s;e People clothed, generally &s;peak|ing,
over their whole Bodies, their Heads, Arms,
Legs, and Feet excepted; but not &s;o agreeably as
tho&s;e we mentioned above; and we found that the
Clothing of the&s;e, were generally the Skins of Bea&s;ts,
but very artfully put together; &s;o that though they
had neither Needle or Thread, yet they had the
&s;ame Plant as I mention'd before, the Stalk of which,
wou'd &s;o &s;trongly tye like a Thread, that they peel'd
it off thicker or finer as they had Occa&s;ion, and made
u&s;e of it abundance of Ways to Tye and Twi&s;t, and
make their Clothes with it, as well for their Occa|&s;ion,
as if it had been Woven in a Loom.</P>
<P>We found &s;everal of the&s;e People had little Bits
of Gold about them; but when we made Signs to
them to know where they got it, and where it
might be had: They made Signs again, pointing
to the Country, on the <HI>North</HI> Side the River, &s;o
that we had it &s;eems Chopt upon the right <HI>Gold
Coa&s;t,</HI> in our fir&s;t Coming: They pointed indeed
likewi&s;e, to &s;ome very high Mountains, which we
<PB N="170" REF="173">
&s;aw at a great Di&s;tance S. W. &s;o that it &s;eems as I
there was Gold found that way al&s;o; but it &s;eems
the People here had not much of it for their &s;hare</P>
<P>The Men here, had Bows and Arrows, and
they u&s;ed them &s;o Dexterou&s;ly, that a Wild
Goo&s;e flying over our Heads, one of the <HI>Indians,</HI>
&s;hot it quite through with an Arrow. One of our
Men was &s;o Provok'd, to &s;ee them, as it were, to
out do him; that &s;ome time after, &s;eeing a couple
of Ducks flying fair for a Mark, he Pre&s;ented his
Piece, and &s;hot them both flying.</P>
<P>I was very Angry, when I heard the Gun, had
I been there, he had never got Leave to &s;hoot:
However, when it was done, I was pleas'd well
enough to &s;ee the Effect it had upon the&s;e poor
innocent Well-Meaning People; at fir&s;t it Fright|ed
them to the la&s;t Degree, and I may well &s;ay, it
Frighted them out of their Wits, for they that
were near it, &s;tarted &s;o violently, that they fell
down and lay Speechle&s;s for &s;ome Time: Tho&s;e that
were farther off, ran away, as if it had been &s;ome
new kind of Lightning and Thunder, and came
out of the earth in&s;tead of out of the Clouds: But
when they &s;aw the two Creatures fall down dead
out of the Air, and could &s;ee nothing that flew up
to them to kill them, they were perfectly a&s;toni&s;h'd,
and laid their two Hands on their Brea&s;ts, and
looked up to Heaven, as if they were &s;aying their
Prayers, in the &s;olemne&s;t Manner imaginable.</P>
<P>However, this Accident gave them terrible
Ideas of us, and I was afraid at fir&s;t, they would
run all away from us for fear: I therefore u&s;ed
them after it, with all the Kindne&s;s and Tender|ne&s;s
imaginable; gave them every Day one Tri&s;le
or other, which tho' of no value to me, they
were exceeding fond of; and as we ask'd
<PB N="171" REF="174">
nothing of them, but Provi&s;ions, of which they
had great Plenty, and gave us enough every Day
to &s;ati&s;fy us: As for Drink, they had none of the
Milky Liquor, which we had on the other part of
the Country: But they had a Root, which they
&s;teep'd in their Water, and made it drink Hot,
as if Pepper had been in it, which made it &s;o
&s;trong, that tho' it wou'd not make our Men
Drunk, it was wor&s;e, for it made them Mad.</P>
<P>I was &s;o pleas'd with the&s;e People, that I came
over to them every other Day, and &s;ome of our
Men lay on Shore, under a Sail pitch'd for a Tent;
and they were &s;o &s;afe, that at la&s;t, they kept no
Watch, for the poor People neither thought any
Harm, or did any; and we never gave them the
lea&s;t, Occa&s;ion to apprehend any Thing from us, at
lea&s;t, not till our Man fir'd the Gun, and that
only let them know we were able to Hurt them,
not giving them the lea&s;t Su&s;pition that we in|tended
it; on the Contrary, one of our Men
play'd an odd Prank with them, and fully &s;atisfy'd
them that we would do them no Harm; this Man
having &s;een one of their Children, a little laughing
&s;peechle&s;s Creature, of about two Years old; the
Mother having gone from it a little way, on &s;ome
particular Occa&s;ion, the Fellow takes it and led it
Home to the Tent, and kept it there all Night.</P>
<P>The next Morning, he dre&s;t it up with Beads
and Jewels wondrous fine, Necklace about its
Neck, and Bracelets of Beads about its Wri&s;t,
and &s;everal Strings of Beads wrapt up and tyed in
its Hair, having fed it, and laid it to &s;leep,
and made much of it all Night; in this
Figure, he carried it up in his Arms to the <HI>Indian</HI>
Huts or Hou&s;es, where he had found it, and
where there had been, it &s;eems, a great Out-Cry
<PB N="172" REF="175">
for the Child all the Night, the Mother crying
and rai&s;ing her Neighbours, and in a mo&s;t &s;trange
Concern.</P>
<P>But when &s;ome of the Women, her Neighbours,
&s;aw the Child brought back, there was a
contrary Extream of Joy; and the Mother of it,
being (I &s;uppo&s;e) fetch'd, &s;he fell a jumping and
dancing, to &s;ee her Child, but al&s;o making &s;o
many odd Ge&s;tures, as our Men could not well
tell for a while, whether &s;he was pleas'd or no:
The Rea&s;on it &s;eems, was, &s;he did not know
whether to Hope or Fear, for &s;he did not know
whether the Man wou'd give back her Child, or
take it away again.</P>
<P>But when the Man, who had the Child in his
Arms, had been told by Signs, that this was the
Mother, he beckoned to have her come to him,
and &s;he came, but trembling for Fear. Then he
took the Child, and Ki&s;&s;ing it two or three times,
he gave it her into her Arms. But it is impo&s;&s;ible, to expre&s;s, by Words, the Agony the
poor Woman was in; &s;he took the Child, and
holding it in her Arms, fix'd her Eyes upon it
without Motion, or as it were, without Life,
for a good While; then &s;he took it, and Em|brac'd
it in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Manner ima|ginable:
When this was over, &s;he fell a Crying
&s;o Vehemently, till &s;he Sobb'd; and all this while,
&s;poke not one Word: When the Crying had
given &s;ufficient Vent to her Pa&s;&s;ion, then &s;he fell
a Dancing, and making a &s;trange odd Noi&s;e, that
we cannot De&s;cribe, and at la&s;t, &s;he leaves the
Child, and comes back to the Place where our
Men were, and to the Man that brought her
Child, and, as &s;oon as &s;he came up to him, &s;he
falls flat on the Ground, as I have Describ'd
<PB N="173" REF="176">
above, the Queen and her Women did, and up
again immediately; and thus &s;he did three times,
which it &s;eems, was her Acknowlegment to
him for bringing it back.</P>
<P>The next Day, <HI>for her Gratitude did not end
here,</HI> &s;he came down to our Tent, and brought
with her two Sheep with a great back Burthen of
Roots, of the kind, which I &s;aid, they &s;teep'd in
the Water; and &s;everal Fruits of the Country,
as much as two Men, who came with her, could
carry; and the&s;e &s;he gave all to the Man that had
brought back her Child. Our Men were &s;o
mov'd, at the affectionate Carriage of this poor
Woman to her Child, that they told me it
brought Tears out of their Eyes.</P>
<P>They took her Pre&s;ent, but the Man that
receiv'd it, took the Woman, and dre&s;t her up as
fine almo&s;t as he had done the Child, and &s;he
went Home like a kind of a Queen among them.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erv'd, while we &s;tay'd here, that this
was a mo&s;t incomparable Soil, that the Earth was
a fat loomy Mould, that the Herbage was &s;trong,
that the Gra&s;s, in &s;ome Places, was very rank and
good, being as high as our Mid-Thigh; and that
the Air was neither very Hot, nor as we believe,
very Cold; we made an Experiment of the
Fruitfulne&s;s of the Soil, for we took &s;ome white
Pea&s;e, and digging the Ground up with a Spade,
we &s;owed &s;ome, and before we went away, we
&s;aw them come out of the Ground again, which
was in about nine Days.</P>
<P>We made Signs to the People, that they &s;hou'd
let them grow, and that if they gathered them,
they were good to eat: We al&s;o Sow'd &s;ome
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wheat, and let them know, as well as
we could, what the U&s;e of them both was. But
<PB N="174" REF="177">
I make no doubt, but they have been bette$
acquainted with both by this time, by an Occa&s;ion
which follow'd</P>
<P>Our Men were &s;o fond of this Place, and &s;o
pleas'd with the Temper of the People, the
Fruitfulne&s;s of the Soil, and Agrecablene&s;s of the
Climate; that about twenty of them offered
me, if I wou'd give them my Word to come
again, or &s;end to them to relieve and &s;upply
them with Nece&s;&s;aries, they wou'd go on $word$
and begin a Colony, and live all their Days there
Nay, after this, their Number came up to three
and thirty; Or, they offer'd, that if I wou'd
give them the Sloop, and leave with them a
Quantity of Goods, e&s;pecially of &s;uch Toys as
they knew wou'd oblige the People to u&s;e the$
well, they wou'd &s;tay at all Hazards, not doubt|ing,
as they told me, but they &s;hould come to
<HI>England</HI> again at la&s;t, with the Sloop full of Gold&punc;</P>
<P>I was not very willing to encourage either of
the&s;e Propo&s;als, becau&s;e, as I told them, I might
perhaps find a Place as &s;it to &s;ettle a Colony
in, before we came Home, which was not at &s;uch
an exce&s;&s;ive Di&s;tance from <HI>England,</HI> &s;o that it
was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible ever to relive them. This
&s;atisfied them pretty well, and they were Content
to give over the Project; and yet, at la&s;t, which
was more Prepo&s;terous than all the re&s;t, five of
our Men and a Boy, ran away from us a$d went
on Shore, and what &s;ort of life they led, or
how they manage, we are &s;carce ever likely to
know, for they are too far off us to enquire after
them again: They took a &s;mall Yaul with them,
and it &s;eems had furni&s;h'd them&s;elves privately
with &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Things, e&s;pecially Tools, a
Grind-Stone, a Barrel of Powder, &s;ome Pea&s;e, &s;ome
<PB N="175" REF="178">
Wheat, and &s;ome Barly; &s;o that it &s;eems, they are
re&s;olv'd to plant there; I confe&s;s I pittied them,
and when I had &s;earched for them, and could not
find them. I cau&s;ed a Letter to be written to
them, and fixt it up upon a Po&s;t, at the Place
where our Ship Careen'd; and another on the
South Side, to tell them, that in &s;uch a certain
Place, I had left other Nece&s;&s;aries for them,
which I did, made up in a large Ca&s;e of Boards
or Planks, and cover'd with Boards like a Shed.</P>
<P>Here I left them Hammocks for Lodging; all
Sorts of Tools for building them a Hou&s;e, Spades,
Shovels, Pick Axes, an Ax, two Saws; with
Clothes, Shoes, Stockings, Hats, Shirts; and in
a Word, every Thing that I could think of for
their U&s;e; and a large Box of Toys, Beads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
to oblige the Trade with the Natives.</P>
<P>One of our Men, who they had made privy to
their De&s;ign, <HI>but made him promi&s;e not to reveal
it, 'till they were gone;</HI> had told them, that he
would per&s;wade me, if he could, to leave them
a farther Supply; and bid them come to the
Place, after the Ships were gone; and that they
&s;hould find Directions left for them, on a Piece
of a Board, or a Letter from him, &s;et up upon a
Po&s;t. Thus they were well furni&s;h'd with all
Things for immediate living.</P>
<P>I make no doubt, but they came to find the&s;e
Things, and &s;ince they had a Mind to make
Tryal of a wild retir'd Life, they might &s;hift
very well. Nor would they want any Thing,
but <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Women, to rai&s;e a new Nation of
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> People; in a Part of the World, that
belongs neither to <HI>Europe, A&s;ia, Africa,</HI> or
<HI>America.</HI> I al&s;o left them every Man another
Gun, a Cutla&s;s, and a Horn for Powder; and I
<PB N="176" REF="179">
left two Barrels of fine Powder, and two Pigs $word$
Lead for Shot, in another Che&s;t by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>I doubt not, but the Natives will be&s;to$
Wives upon them, but what Sort of a Po&s;terit;
they will make, I cannot fore&s;ee; For I don'$
find by Enquiry, that the Fellows had any grea$
Store of Knowledge or Religion in them, being
all <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Men, <HI>as we call'd them;</HI> that is to
&s;ay, Pyrates and Rogues; So that for ought
know, there may be a Generation of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hea$
thens in an Age or two more; tho' I left then
five Bibles, and &s;ix or &s;even Prayer Books, and
good Books of &s;everal Sorts; that they might
not want In&s;truction, if they thought fit to
make U&s;e of it, for them&s;elves or their Progeny.</P>
<P>It is true, this is a Country that is mo&s;t remote
from us, of any in the yet di&s;cover'd World,
and co&s;equently, it would be &s;ugge&s;ted as unpro|fitable
to our Commerce; but I have &s;omething
to alledge in its Defence, which will prove it to be
infinitely more advantageous to <HI>England,</HI> than
any of our <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade can be, or than can
be pretended for it. The Rea&s;on is plain in a few
Words: Our <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade is all carry'd on,
or mo&s;t Part of it, by an Exportation of Bullion
in Specie; and a Return of foreign Manufactures
or Produce; and mo&s;t of the&s;e Manufactures al&s;o,
either trifling and unnece&s;&s;ary in them&s;elves; or
&s;uch as are injurious to our own Manufactures.
The &s;olid Goods brought from <HI>India,</HI> which may
be &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary to us, and worth &s;ending
our Money for, are but few; for Example:
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>I. The Returns, which I reckon trifling
and unnece&s;&s;ary, are, &s;uch as <HI>China</HI> Ware,
<PB N="177" REF="180">
Coffee, Tea, Japan Works, Pictures,
Fans, Skreens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The Returns, that are injurious to our
Manufactures, or Growth of our own
Country; are printed Callicoes, Chints,
wrought Silks, Stuffs of Herba and Barks,
Block-Tin, Sugar, Cotton, Arrack, Cop|per,
Indico.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful Things are Pep|per,
&s;alt Peter, dying Woods and dying
Earths, Drugs, Lacks, &s;uch as Shel-lack,
Stick-lack, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Diamonds, and &s;ome
Pearl, and raw Silk.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
For all the&s;e we carry nothing or very little but
Money; the innumerable Nations of the <HI>Indies,
China, &amp;c.</HI> de&s;pi&s;ing our Manufactures, and fil|ling
us with their own.</P>
<P>On the Countrary, the People in the <HI>Southern</HI>
unknown Countries, being fir&s;t of all very nume|rous,
and living in a temperate Climate, which
requires clothing, and having no Manufactures,
or Materials for Manufacturs of their own, wou'd
con&s;equently take off a very great Quantity of
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woollen-Manufactures, e&s;pecially when
Civiliz'd by our dwelling among them, and
taught the Manner of Clothing them&s;elves for
their Ea&s;e and Convenience; and in Return for
the&s;e Manufactures, 'tis Evident, we &s;hou'd have
Gold in Specie, and perhaps Spices; the be&s;t
Merehandize and Return in the World.</P>
<P>I need &s;ay no more to Excite adventurous
Heads to &s;earch out a Country, by which &s;uch an
Improvement might be made, and which would be
&s;uch an Encrea&s;e of, or Addition to the Wealth
and Commerce of our Country.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="181">
Nor can it be objected here, that this Nook of
the Country may not ea&s;ily be found by any One
but by us, that have been there before, and per|haps
not by us again exactly; for not to enter
into our Journal of Ob&s;ervations for their Direc|tion,
I lay it down as a Foundation; that who|ever,
Sailing over the <HI>South-Seas,</HI> keeps a &s;tated
Di&s;tance from the Tropick to the Latitude of
fifty &s;ix, to &s;ixty Degrees, and &s;teers <HI>Ea&s;tward</HI>
towards the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Magellan,</HI> &s;hall never
fail to di&s;cover new Worlds, new Nations, and
new inexhau&s;tible Funds of Wealth and Com|merce,
&s;uch as never were yet known to the
Merchants of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>This is the true Ocean call'd the <HI>South-Sea;</HI> that
Part that we corruptly call &s;o, can be &s;o in no
Geographical Account, or by any Rule but by
the meer Impo&s;ition of Cu&s;tom, it being only
originally call'd &s;o, becau&s;e they that Sailed
to it, were oblig'd to go round the <HI>Southtermo&s;t</HI>
part of <HI>America</HI> to come into it; whereas it ought
indeed to be call'd the <HI>We&s;t-Sea,</HI> as it lies on the
<HI>We&s;t</HI> Side of <HI>America,</HI> and Wa&s;hes the <HI>We&s;tern</HI>
Shore of that great Continent for near eight
thou&s;and Miles in length; <HI>to wit,</HI> from fifty &s;ix
Degrees <HI>South</HI> of the Line, to &s;eventy Degrees
<HI>North;</HI> and how much farther, we know not: On
this Account, I think, it ought to be called the
<HI>American</HI> Ocean, rather than with &s;uch Impro|priety
the <HI>South-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>But this part of the World where we were,
may rightly be called the <HI>SO&V;TH-SEA,</HI> by Way
of Di&s;tinction, as it extends from <HI>India,</HI> round
the Globe, to <HI>India</HI> again; and lies all <HI>South of
the Line</HI> (even for ought we know) to the very
<HI>South Pole,</HI> and which, except &s;ome Interpo&s;ition
<PB N="179" REF="182">
of Land, whether I&s;lands or Continent, really
&s;urrounds the <HI>South</HI> Pole.</P>
<P>We were now in the very Center or Middle of
this <HI>South-Sea;</HI> being, as I have &s;aid, in the Lati|tude
of thirty four Degrees twenty Minutes;
but having had &s;uch good Succe&s;s in our Enquiry,
or Search after new Continents, I re&s;olved to
Steer to the <HI>S.</HI> and <HI>S. E.</HI> as far, as till we &s;hou'd
be interrupted by Land or Ice, determining to
&s;earch this unknown Part of the Globe, as far as
Nature wou'd permit, that I might be able to
give &s;ome Account to my Employers, and &s;ome
Light to other People that might come that
Way, whether by Accident or by De&s;ign.</P>
<P>We had &s;pent &s;ix and twenty Days in this Place,
as well in Repairing our Brigantine and Careening,
and Triming our Ship, that we had not been &s;o
long, but that we did not re&s;olve to Careen our
Ships, till we had &s;pent ten Days about the Brigan|tine,
and then we found more Work to do to the
Sheathing of the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship than we expected.</P>
<P>We &s;tored our &s;elves here with fre&s;h Provi&s;ions
and Water, but got nothing that we could call a
Store, except the Fle&s;h of about thirty Deer,
which we Dry'd in the Sun, and which eat indiffe|rently
well afterward, but not exraordinary.</P>
<P>We &s;ailed again the &s;ix and twentieth Day
after we came in, having a fair Wind at <HI>N.</HI> and
<HI>N. N. W;</HI> and a fre&s;h Gale, which held us five
Days without Intermi&s;&s;ion; in which Time, run|ing
away <HI>S.</HI> and <HI>S. S. E.</HI> we reach'd the former
Latitude, where we had been; and meering
with nothing remarkable, we &s;teer'd a little
farther to the <HI>Ea&s;tward;</HI> but keeping a <HI>Southerly,</HI>
Cour&s;e &s;till, 'till we came into the Latitude of
forty one; and then going due <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> with the
<PB N="180" REF="183">
Wind at <HI>N.</HI> and by <HI>W.</HI> we reckon'd our Meridian
Di&s;tance from the <HI>Ladrones,</HI> to be fifty Degrees
and a half.</P>
<P>In all this Run we &s;aw no Land, &s;o we hall'd
two Points more <HI>Southerly</HI> and went on for &s;ix
or &s;even Days more; when one of our Men on
the round Top, cry'd Land. It was a clear fine
Morning, and the Land he &s;py'd, being very
high, it was found to be &s;ixteen Leagues Di|&s;tance;
and the Wind &s;lacking, we could not get
in that Night, &s;o we lay by 'till Morning; when
being fair with the Land, we hoi&s;ted our Boat
to go and &s;ound the Shore, as u&s;ual. They row'd
in clo&s;e with the Shore, and found a little Cove;
where there was good riding, but very deep
Water; being no le&s;s than &s;ixty Fathom within
Cables Length of the Shore.</P>
<P>We went in however, and after we were
moor'd, &s;ent our Boat on Shore to look for
Water, and what el&s;e the Country afforded. Our
Men found Water, and a good Sort of Country,
but &s;aw no Inhabitants; and upon coa&s;ting a
little both Ways on the Shore, they found it to
be an I&s;land, and without People; but found
that about three Leagues off to the <HI>Southward,</HI>
there &s;eem'd to be a <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> or Continent
of Land; where, it was more likely, we &s;hould
make &s;ome Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The next Day we fill'd Water again, and &s;hot
&s;ome Ducks; and the Day after weigh'd, and
&s;tood over for the Main, as we thought it to
be; here u&s;ing the &s;ame Caution as we always
had done; (<HI>viz.</HI>) of &s;ounding the Coa&s;t, we
found a bold Shore, and very good Anchor hold,
in &s;ix and twenty to thirty Fathom.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="184">
When we came on Shore here, we found
People, but of a quite different Condition, from
tho&s;e we had met with before; being wild,
furious, and untractable, &s;urpriz'd at the Sight
of us, but not frighted; preparing for Battle,
not for Trade; and no &s;ooner were we on Shore,
but they &s;aluted us with their Bows and Arrows.
We made Signals of Truce to them, but they
did not under&s;tand us; and we knew not what to
offer them more, but the Muzzles of our Mu&s;|quets;
for we were re&s;olv'd to &s;ee, what Sort of
Folks they were, either by fair Means or foul.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Time therefore, that they &s;hot at
our Men with their Bows and Arrows, we re|turn'd
the Salute with our Mu&s;quet|Ball,
and killed two of their be&s;t Archers. We could ea&s;ily
perceive, that the Noi&s;e of our Pieces terrify'd
them; and the two Men being kill'd, they knew
not how, or with what, perfectly a &s;toni&s;h'd them;
of that they ran, as it were, clean out of the
Country; that is to &s;ay, clean out of our Reach;
for we could never &s;et our Eyes upon any of
them after it. We coa&s;ted this Place al&s;o, accoding
to our u&s;ual Cu&s;toms; and to our great
Surprize, found it was an I&s;land too, tho' a large
one; and that the main Land lay &s;till more to
the <HI>Southward,</HI> about &s;ix Leagues Di&s;tance; &s;o
were&s;olv'd to look out farther, and accordingly
&s;e tSail the next Day, and anchor'd under the
Shore of this la&s;t Land, which, we were per&s;uaded,
was really the Main.</P>
<P>We went on Shore here peaceably, for we
neither &s;aw any People, or the Appearance of
any; But a charming plea&s;ant Valley, of about
ten or eleven Miles long, and five or &s;ix Miles
broad; and then it was &s;urrounded with
<PB N="182" REF="185">
Mountains, which reach'd the full Length; run|ing
parallel with the Valley, and clo&s;ing it in
to the Sea at both Ends; &s;o that it was a natural
Park; having the Sea on the <HI>North</HI> Side, and the
Mountains in a Semi-circle round all the re&s;t of
it, The&s;e Hills were &s;o high, and the Ways &s;o
untrod and &s;o &s;teep, that our Men, who were
curious enough to have climb'd to the Top of
them, could find no Way, that was practicable
to get up; and &s;o after two or three Attempts
gave it over.</P>
<P>In this Vale we found abundance of Deer, and
abundance of the &s;ame Kind of Sheep, which I
mention'd lately. We kill'd as many of both, as
we had Occa&s;ion for; and finding nothing here
worth our &s;taying any longer for, except that
we &s;aw &s;mething like wild Rice growing here,
we weigh'd after three Days, and &s;tood away &s;till
to the <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>We had not &s;ail'd above two Days with little
Wind, and an ea&s;y Sail, but we perceiv'd this
al&s;o was an I&s;land, tho' it mu&s;t be a large one;
for by our Account, we &s;ail'd near a hundred and
fifty Miles along the Shore of it; and we found
the <HI>South</HI> Part, a flat plea&s;ant Country enough;
and our Men &s;aid, they &s;aw People upon it, on
the <HI>South</HI> Side; but we went not on Shore there
any more.</P>
<P>Steering due <HI>South</HI> from hence in Que&s;t of the
mainLand, we went on eleven Days more, and &s;aw
nothing &s;ignificant; and upon a fair Ob&s;ervation,
I found, we were in the Latitude of &s;even
and forty Degrees and eight Minutes <HI>South;</HI> then
I alter'd my Cour&s;e a little to the <HI>Ea&s;tward,</HI>
finding no Land, and the Weather very cold,
and going on with a fre&s;h Gale at <HI>S. S. W.</HI> for four
<PB N="183" REF="186">
Days, We made Land again; but it was now to
the <HI>E. N. E.</HI> of that we were goten, as we may
&s;ay, beyond it.</P>
<P>We fell in with this Land in the Evening,
&s;o that it was not perceiv'd till we was within
half a League of it, which very much alarm'd
us; the Land being low, and having found our
Error, we brought too, nnd &s;tood off and on
till Morning, when we &s;aw the Shore lie, as it
were, under our Larboard-bow, within a Mile
and a Quarter Di&s;tance; the Land low, but the Sea
deep and &s;oft Ground. We came to an Anchor
immediately, and &s;ent our Shallops to &s;ound the
Shore, who found very good Riding in a little
Bay, under the Shelter of two Points of Land,
one of which made a kind of Hook, under
which we lay &s;ecure from all Winds that could
blow, in &s;eventeen Fathom good Ground. Here
we had a good Ob&s;ervation, and found our &s;elves
in the Latitude of fifty Degrees twenty one Mi|nutes.
Our next Work was to find Water,
and our Boats going a-Shore, found Plenty of
good Water, and &s;ome Cattle; but told us they
could give no Account what they were, or what
they were like. In &s;earching this Coa&s;t, we &s;oon
found this was an I&s;land al&s;o about eleven Leagues
in Length from <HI>N. W.</HI> to <HI>S. E.</HI> what Breadth we
could not tell. Our Men al&s;o, &s;aw &s;ome Signs of
Inhabitants; the next Day &s;ix Men appear'd
at a Di&s;tance, but would take Notice of no
Signals, and fled as &s;oon as our Men advanc'd.
Our People went up to the Place where they
lay, and found they had had a Fire of &s;ome dry
Wood; that they had lain there, as they &s;up|pos'd,
all night, tho' without Covering; they
found two Pieces of old ragged Skins of Deer,
<PB N="184" REF="187">
which look'd as if worn out by &s;ome that had
u&s;ed them for Cloathing; one Piece of a Skin o$
&s;ome other Creature which had been roll'd up in|to
a Cap for the Head, and a Couple of Arrows
of about four Foot long, very thick, and made
of a hard and heavy Wood; &s;o they mu&s;t have
very large and &s;trong Bows to &s;hoot &s;uch Ar|rows,
and con&s;equently mu&s;t be Men of an un|common
Strength.</P>
<P>Our Men wandred about the Country here three
or four Days, with le&s;s Caution, than the Nature
of the Thing requir'd for they were not among
a People of an innocent inoffen&s;ive Temper here,
as before, but among a wild untractable Nation;
that perhaps had never &s;een Creatures in their
own Likene&s;s before; and had no Thoughts of
them&s;elves, but of being kill'd and de&s;troy'd; and
con&s;equently had no Thoughts of them they had
&s;een, but as of Enemies, whom they mu&s;t either
de&s;troy, if they were able, or e&s;cape from them,
if they were not. However, we got no Harm;
neither would the Natives ever appear, to accept
any Kindne&s;&s;es from us.</P>
<P>We had no Bu&s;ine&s;s here, after we found what
Sort of People they were, who inhabited this
Place. So as &s;oon as we had taken in fre&s;h, Water,
and catch'd &s;ome Fi&s;h, of which we found good
Store, in the Harbour or Bay where we rode,
we prepar'd to be gone. Here we found the fir&s;t
Oy&s;ters, that we &s;aw any where in the <HI>South Seas;</HI>
and as our Men found them but the Day before
we were &s;ail, they made great Intreaty to me,
to let them &s;tay one Day to get a Quantity on
Board; they being very refre&s;hing, as well as
nouri&s;hing to our Men.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="188">
But I was more ea&s;ily prevail'd with to &s;tay,
when Captain <HI>Merlotte brought</HI> me out of one
Oy&s;ter that he happen'd to open, a true Oriental
Pearl; &s;o large and &s;o fine, that I &s;old it, &s;ince
my return, for three and fifty Pound.</P>
<P>After taking this Oy&s;ter, I order'd all our
Boats out a dredging; and in two Days Time, &s;o
great a Quantity there was, that our Men had
taken above fifty Bu&s;hels, mo&s;t of them very
large. But we were &s;urpriz'd, you may be &s;ure,
when, at the opening all the&s;e Oy&s;ters, we found
not one Pearl, &s;mall nor great, of any Kind what|ever;
&s;o we concluded, that the other was a
lucky Hit only; and that perhaps there might
not be any more of that Kind in the&s;e Seas.</P>
<P>While we were mu&s;ing on the Oddne&s;s of this
Accident, the Boat&s;wain of the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship,
who&s;e Boat's Crew had brougt in the great Oy&s;|ter,
in which the Pearl was found, and who had
been examining the Matter; came and told me,
That it was true, that their Boat had brought in
the Oy&s;ter; and that it was before they went
out a dredging in the offing; but that their
Boat took the&s;e Oy&s;ters on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Side of the I&s;land,
where they had been &s;hoaring, as they call'd it;
that is to &s;ay, coa&s;ting along the Shore, to &s;ee if
they cou$d find any Thing worth their Labour;
but that afterwards the Boat went a dredging
in the Mouth of the Bay where we rode; and
where finding good Store of Oy&s;ters, they had
gone no farther.</P>
<P>upon this Intelligence we order'd all Hands
to dredging again, on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Side of the I&s;land.
This was in a narrow Channel, between this
I&s;land, and, a little Clu&s;ter of I&s;lands; which we
we found together extended <HI>We&s;t,</HI> the Channel,
<PB N="186" REF="189">
where our Men fi&s;h'd, might be about a Leagn
over, &s;omething better; and the Water abou|$ive
to &s;even Fathom deep.</P>
<P>They came home well tir'd, and ill pleas'd
having taken nothing near &s;o many Oy&s;ters, a
before. But I was much better pleas'd, when it
opening them, we found a hundred and
fifty eight Pearls, of the mo&s;t perfect Colour
and of extraordinary Shape and Size; be&s;ides
double the Number of a le&s;s Size, and irregular
Shape.</P>
<P>This quicken'd our Diligence, and encourag'd
our Men; for I promis'd the Men two Peices of
Eight to each Man above his Pay, if I got any
con&s;iderable Quantity of Pearl. Upon this they
&s;pread them&s;eves among the I&s;lands, and fi&s;h'd
for a whole Week; and I got &s;uch a Quantity of
Pearl, as made it very well worth our while;
and be&s;ides that, I had Rea&s;on to believe, the
Men, at lea&s;t the Officers, who went with them,
conceal'd a con&s;iderable Quantity among them|&s;elves;
which, however, I did not think fit to
enquire very &s;trictly after at that Time.</P>
<P>Had we been nearer home, and not at &s;o very
great an Expence as three Ships, and &s;o many
Men at Victuals and Wages; or had we been,
where we might have left one of our Ve&s;&s;els to
fi&s;h, and have come to them again; We would
not have given it over, while there had been an
Oy&s;ter left in the Sea; or at lea&s;t, that we could
come at: But as Things &s;tood, I re&s;olv'd to give
it over, and put to Sea.</P>
<P>But when I was ju&s;t giving Orders, Captain
<HI>Merlotte</HI> came to me, and told me, that all the
Officers in the three Ships had joyn'd together to
make an humble Petition to me; which was,
<PB N="187" REF="190">
that I would give them one Day to fi&s;h for them|&s;elves;
that the Men had promi&s;ed, that if I
would con&s;ent, they would work for them <HI>Gra|tis;</HI>
and they promis'd, if they gain'd any Thing
con&s;iderable, they would account for as much
out of their Wages, as &s;hould defray the Ships
Expence, Victuals, and Wages, for the Day.</P>
<P>This was &s;o &s;mall a Reque&s;t, that I readily
con&s;ented to it; and told them, I would give
them three Days, provided, they were willing to
give the Men a Large&s;s, as I had done, in Pro|portion
to their Gain. This they agreed to, and
to Work they went; but whether it was that
the Fellows work'd with a better Will, or that
the Officers gave them more Liquor, or that they
found a new Bank of Oy&s;ters, which had not
been found out before; But &s;o it was, that the
Officers got as many Pearls, and &s;ome of extraor|dinary
Size and Beauty, as they afterwards &s;old
when they came to <HI>Peru,</HI> for 3217 Pieces of Eight.</P>
<P>When they had done this, I told them it was
but meet, that as they had made &s;o good a Pur|cha&s;e
for them&s;elves by the Labour of the Men,
the Men &s;hou'd have the Con&s;ideration which I
had proposed to them. But now I wou'd make
another Condition with them, That we would &s;tay
three Days more, and what ever was Catch'd in
the&s;e three Days, &s;hou'd be Share'd among the
Men at the fir&s;t Port we came at, where they could be
Sold; that the Men who had now been out &s;o long,
might have &s;omething to buy Clothes and Liquors,
without anticipating their Wages: But then I
made a Condition with the Men too, <HI>viz.</HI> that
what ever was taken, they &s;hou'd Depo&s;ite it in
my Hands, and with the joynt Tru&s;t of three Men
of their own Choo&s;ing, one out of each Ship, and
<PB N="188" REF="191">
that we wou'd &s;ell the Pearl, and I &s;hould divide the
Money among them equally, that &s;o there might
be no Quarelling or Di&s;content, and that none of
them &s;hou'd play any Part of it away: The&s;e
Engagements they all came willingly into, and
away they went a Dredging, Relieving one ano|ther
punctually; &s;o that in the whole three Days,
every Man Work'd an equal Share of Hours with
the re&s;t.</P>
<P>But the poor Men had not &s;o good Luck for
them&s;elves, as they had for their Officers. How|ever,
they got a con&s;iderable Quantity, and &s;ome
very fine ones; among the re&s;t, they had Two, in
the exact Shape of a Pear, and very exactly
Match'd; and the&s;e they wou'd needs make me a
Pre&s;ent of, becau&s;e I had been &s;o kind to them,
to make the Propo&s;al for them: I wou'd have
paid for them two hundred Pieces of Eight,
but One and All, they wou'd not be paid; and
wou'd certainly have been very much Affronted,
if I had not accepted of them; and yet the Succe&s;s of
the Men was not &s;o &s;mall, but join'd with the two
Pieces of Eight a Man, which I allowed them on
the Ships Account, and the like Allowance the
Officers made them, and the Produce of their
own Purcha&s;e they Divided afterwards, about
fifteen Pieces of Eight a Man, which was a great
Encouragement to them.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;pent in the whole, near three Weeks
here, and called the&s;e the <HI>Pearl-I&s;lands,</HI> tho' we
had given no Names to any Places before; we
were the more Surpriz'd with this Unexpected
Booty, becau&s;e we all thought it very Unu&s;ual, to
find Pearl of &s;o excellent a Kind in &s;uch a Latitude
as that of forty nine, to fifty; but it &s;eems there
are Riches yet unknown in tho&s;e Parts of the
<PB N="189" REF="192">
World, where they have never been yet expected;
and I have been told, by tho&s;e who pretend to
give a Rea&s;on for it, that if there was any Land
directly under the Poles, either <HI>South</HI> or <HI>North,</HI>
there wou'd be found Gold of a Finene&s;s more than
Double to any that was ever yet found in the
World: And this is the Rea&s;on, they &s;ay, why
the Magnetick Influence, directs to the Poles, that
being the Center of the mo&s;t pure Metals; and
why the Needle, toucht with the Load-Stone, or
Magnet, always points to the <HI>North</HI> or <HI>South</HI> Pole.
But I do not recommend this as a Certainty,
becau&s;e, 'tis Evident, no Demon&s;tration could
ever be arriv'd to, nor could any Creature reach
to that particular Spot of Land under the Pole,
if &s;uch there &s;hould be, tho&s;e Lands being Sur|rounded
with Mountains of Snow, and frozen
Seas which never Thaw, and are uterly Un|pa&s;&s;ible,
either for Ships or Men.</P>
<P>But to return to our Voyage, having thus
&s;pent, as I have &s;aid, three Weeks on this un|expected
Expedition; we &s;et Sail, and as I was
almo&s;t &s;atisfied with the Di&s;coveries we had made,
I was for bending my Cour&s;e <HI>Due-Ea&s;t,</HI> and &s;o
directly for the <HI>South</HI> part of <HI>America;</HI> but the
Winds now blowing fre&s;h from the <HI>N. W.</HI> and
good Weather, I took the Occa&s;ion, as a Fa|vourable
Summons, to keep &s;till on <HI>Southing</HI> as well as
<HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> till we came into the Latitude of fifty &s;ix;
when our Men who had been all along, a Warm-Weather-Voyage,
began to be Pinch't very much
with the Cold, and particularly Complain'd, that
they had not Cloaths &s;ufficient for it.</P>
<P>But they were brought to be Content by Force;
for the Wind continuing at <HI>N.</HI> and <HI>N. N. W.</HI> and
blowing very hard, we were oblig'd to keep onour
<PB N="190" REF="193">
Cour&s;e farther <HI>South</HI> indeed, than I ever intended&punc;
and one of our Men &s;wore we &s;hou'd be driven to
the <HI>South</HI>-Pole; indeed, we rather ran afore it,
than kept our Cour&s;e; and in this Run, we &s;uf|fered
the extreame&s;t Cold, tho' a <HI>Northerly</HI> Wind
in tho&s;e Latitudes is the warm Wind, as a <HI>Souther|ly</HI>
is here; but it was attended with Rain and
Snow, and both Freezing Violently; at length,
One of our Men cry'd out Land, and our Men
began to rejoice; but I was quite of a differing
Opinion, and my Fears were but too ju&s;t;
for as &s;oon as ever he cry'd Land, and that I ask'd him
in what Quarter, and he an&s;wered <HI>Due South</HI> which
was almo&s;t right a Head, I bid wear the Ship, and put
her about immediately, not doubting, but in&s;tead
of Land, I &s;hou'd find it a Mountain of Ice, and
&s;o it was; and it was Happy for us that we had a
&s;tout Ship under us, for it blew a Fret of Wind.
However, the Ship came very well about, tho'
when &s;he fill'd again, we found the Ice not half a
League Di&s;tance under our Stern.</P>
<P>As I hapened to be the Head mo&s;t Ship, I fir'd
two Guns to give Notice to our other Ve&s;&s;els, for
that was our Signal to come about, but that
which was very Unea&s;y to me, the Weather was
Hazy, and they were both out of Sight; which
was the fir&s;t time that we lo&s;t Sight of one ano|ther
in tho&s;e Seas: However, being both to
Windward, and within Hearing of my Guns, they
took the Warning, and came about with more
Lea&s;ure, and le&s;s Hazard than I had done.</P>
<P>I &s;tood away now to the <HI>Ea&s;tward,</HI> firing
Guns continually, that they might know which
Way to follow; and they an&s;wered me duly, to
let me know that they heard me.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="194">
It was our great good Hap al&s;o, that it was
Day when we e&s;caped this Danger; in the After|noon
the Wind abated, and the Weather clear'd
up: We then call'd a Council, and re&s;olv'd to go no
farther <HI>S.</HI> being then in the Latitude of &s;ixty
&s;even <HI>South,</HI> which I &s;uppo&s;e, is the farthe&s;t
<HI>Southern</HI> Latitude that any <HI>European</HI> Ship ever &s;aw
in tho&s;e Seas.</P>
<P>That Night it froze extreamly hard, and the
Wind Veering to the <HI>S. W.</HI> it was the &s;evere&s;t
Cold that ever I felt in my Life; a Barrel or
Cask of Water, which &s;tood on the Deck, Froze
intirely in one Night, into one Lump, and our
Cooper, Knocking off the Hoops from the Cask,
took it to Pieces, and the Barrel of Ice &s;tood by
it &s;elf, in the true Shape of the Ve&s;&s;el It had been
in. This Wind was however Favourable to our
Deliverance, for we &s;tood away now <HI>N. E.</HI> and
<HI>N. E.</HI> by <HI>N.</HI> making fre&s;h Way with a fair
Wind.</P>
<P>We made no more Land, till we came into
the Latitude of &s;ixty two, when we &s;aw &s;ome
I&s;lands at a great Di&s;tance, on both Sides of us;
we believed them to be I&s;lands, becau&s;e we &s;aw
many of them, with large Openings between.
But we were all &s;o willing, to get into a warmer
Climate, that we did not incline to put in any
where, till having run thus fifteen Days, and the
Wind &s;till holding <HI>Southerly</HI> with &s;mall Alteration
and clear Weather, We could ea&s;ily perceive the
Climate alter'd, and the Weather grew Milder;
and here taking an Ob&s;ervation, I found my
&s;elf in the Latitude of Fifty and a Half, and that
our Meridian-Di&s;tance from the <HI>Ladrones We&s;t,</HI>
was eighty &s;even Degrees, being almo&s;t one
Sem-idiamiter of the Globe, &s;o that I could not
<PB N="192" REF="195">
be far from the Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> which was my
next De&s;ign, and indeed, the chief De&s;ign of the
whole Voyage.</P>
<P>On this Expectation, I chang'd my Cour&s;e a
little, and went away <HI>N.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> till by an Ob&s;er|vation,
I found my &s;elf in forty &s;even Degrees
&s;even Minutes, and then &s;tanding away <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> for
about eleven Days more, we made the Tops of
the <HI>Andes</HI> the great Mountains of <HI>Chili</HI> in <HI>South-America</HI>
to our great Joy and Satisfaction, tho' at
a very great Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>We found our Di&s;tance from the Shore, not
le&s;s than twenty Leagues, the Mountains being
&s;o very High, and our next Bu&s;ine&s;s was to Con|&s;ider,
what part of the <HI>Andes</HI> it mu&s;t be, and to
what Port we &s;hou'd Direct our &s;elves fir&s;t. Upon
the Whole, we found we were too much to the
<HI>South</HI> &s;till, and re&s;olved to make directly for the
River or Port of <HI>Valdivia</HI> or <HI>Baldivia,</HI> call it
which you plea&s;e, in the Latitude of forty De|grees;
&s;o we &s;tood away to the <HI>North:</HI> The next
Day this <HI>Pacifick quiet Sea,</HI> as they call'd it, &s;hew'd
us a very frowning rough Countenance, and
prov'd the very Extreme of a contrary Di&s;po&s;ition.
For it blew a Storm of Wind at <HI>E.</HI> by <HI>S.</HI> and
drove us off the Coa&s;t again, but it abated again
for a Day or two; and then for &s;ix Days together,
it blew exce&s;&s;ive hard, almo&s;t all at <HI>Ea&s;t;</HI> &s;o that
I found no po&s;&s;ibility of getting into the Shore:
And be&s;ides, I found that the Winds came off that
Mountainous Country in Squals; and that the
nearer we came the Hills, the Gu&s;ts were the
more Violent: So I re&s;olved to run for the I&s;land
of <HI>Juan $erandes</HI> to refre&s;h our &s;elves there until
the Weather was &s;ettled, and be&s;ides we wanted
fre&s;h Water very much.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="196">
The little that the Wind &s;tood <HI>Southerly</HI>
help'd me in this Run, and we came in five
Days more fair with the I&s;land, to our great Joy,
and brought all our Ships to an Anchor as near
the watering Place as is u&s;ual, where we rode
ea&s;y, tho' the Wind continued to blow very hard;
and being, I &s;ay, now about the Middle of our
Voyage, I &s;hall break off my Account here, as
of the fir&s;t Part of my Work, and begin again
at our Departure from hence.</P>
<P>It is true, we had got over much the great|er
Run, as to Length of Way; but the mo&s;t
important Part of our Voyage was yet to come,
and we had no incon&s;iderable Length to run nei|ther,
for as we purpo&s;ed to &s;ail <HI>North,</HI> the
Height of <HI>Panama,</HI> in the Latitude of nine De|grees
<HI>N.</HI> and back again by Cape <HI>Horn,</HI> in the

we were now in forty Degrees <HI>South;</HI> tho&s;e three
added to the Run, from Cape <HI>Horn</HI> home to <HI>Eng|land,</HI>

<P>But to return a little to our Stay in this Place,
for that belongs to this Part of my Account, and
of which I mu&s;t make a few &s;hort Ob&s;erva|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="198">
It was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to re&s;train <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men,
after &s;o long beating the Sea, from going on
Shore, when they came to &s;uch a Place of
Refre&s;hment as this; nor indeed was it rea|&s;onable
to re&s;train them, con&s;idering how we all
might be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;tand in need of Refre&s;h|ment;
and con&s;idering that here was no Length
of Ground for the Men to wander in, no Liquors
to come at to di&s;tract them with their Exce&s;s;
and, which was &s;till more, no Women to di&s;order
or debauch them: We all knew their chief Ex|erci&s;e
would be Hunting Goats for their Sub&s;i&s;t|ance;
and we knew al&s;o, that, however they
wanted the Benefit of fre&s;h Provi&s;ion, they
mu&s;t work hard to catch it, before they could
ta&s;te the Sweet of it. Upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations,
I &s;ay, our Ships being well moor'd, and
riding &s;afe, we re&s;train'd none of them, except
a due Number to take Care of each Ship; and
tho&s;e were taken out by Lot, and then had their
Turn al&s;o to go on Shore &s;ome Days after|wards,
and, in the mean Time, had both fre&s;h
Water and fre&s;h Meat &s;ent them immediately,
and that in &s;ufficient Quantity, to their Satisfac|tion.
As &s;oon as we were on Shore, and had
look'd about us, we begun fir&s;t with getting
&s;ome fre&s;h Water, for we greatly wanted it, then
carrying a &s;mall C$sk of Arack on Shore, I
made a Quantity of i$ be put into a whole Butt
of Water before I let our Men drink a Drop;
&s;o correcting little the Chilne&s;s of the Water,
becau&s;e I knew they would drink an immoderate
Quantity, and endanger their Healths: And the
Effect an&s;wer'd my C$re; for tho&s;e who drank
at the Spring, where they took in the Water,
before I got this Butt fill'd, and before the
<PB N="196" REF="199">
Arack was put into it, fell into Swoonings and
faint Sweats, having gorg'd them&s;elves too
much with the cool Water; and two or three,
I thought, would have dy'd; but our Surgeons
took &s;uch Care of them, that they recover'd.</P>
<P>While this was doing, others cut down
Branches of Trees, and built us two large Booths,
and five or &s;ix &s;maller; and we made two Tents
with &s;ome old Sails: And thus we encamp'd, as
if we had been to take up our Dwelling, and in|tended
to People the I&s;land.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time, others of our Men began
to look out for Goats, for you may believe, we all
long'd for a little fre&s;h Meat. They were a lit|tle
too ha&s;ty at their Work at fir&s;t; for firing a|mong
the fir&s;t Goats they came at, when there
was but a few Men together, they frighted the
Creatures, and they ran all away into Holes,
and among the Rocks and Places where we
could not find them: So that for that Day they
made little of it. However, &s;ending for more
Fire-men, they made a Shift to bring in &s;even|teen
Goats the &s;ame Day; whereof we &s;ent five
on Board the Ships, and fea&s;ted with the re&s;t on
Shore. But the next Day the Men went to work
in another Manner, and with better Conduct;
for as we had Hands enough, and Fire-arms e|nough,
they &s;pread them&s;elves &s;o far, that they,
as it were, &s;urrounded the Creatures, and &s;o
driving them out of their Fa&s;t ne&s;&s;es and Retreats,
they had no Occa&s;ion to &s;hoot, for the Goats
could not get from them, and they took them e|very
where with their Hands, except &s;ome of
the old He-goats, which were &s;o &s;urly, that
they would &s;tand at Bay, and ri&s;e at them, and would
<PB N="197" REF="200">
not be taken; and the&s;e, as being old al&s;o, and
as they thought, good for nothing, they let go.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;o many of our Men went on Shore,
and the&s;e divided them&s;elves into &s;o many little
Parties, and ply'd their Work &s;o hard, and had
&s;uch good Luck, that I told them, it look'd as if
they had made a general Ma&s;&s;acre of the Goats,
rather than a Hunting.</P>
<P>Our Men al&s;o might be &s;aid, not to refre&s;h
them&s;elves, but to fea&s;t them&s;elves here with
fre&s;h Provi&s;ions; for, tho' we &s;tay'd but thirteen
Days, yet we kill'd three hundred and &s;eventy
Goats; and our Men who were on Board, were
very merrily employ'd, I a&s;&s;ure you; for they
might be &s;aid to do very little but <HI>roa&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;tew,</HI>
and <HI>broil</HI> and <HI>fry</HI> from Morning to Night; it
was indeed an exceeding Supply to them, for
they had been extremely fatigu'd with the la&s;t
Part of their Voyage, and had had no fre&s;h Pro|vi&s;ions
for &s;ix Weeks before.</P>
<P>This made them hunt the Goats with the
more Eagerne&s;s; and indeed, they &s;urrounded
them &s;o dexterou&s;ly, and follow'd them &s;o nim|bly,
that notwith&s;tanding the Difficulties of the
Rocks, yet the Goats could hardly ever e&s;|cape
them. Here our Men found al&s;o very good
Fi&s;h, and &s;ome few Tortoi&s;es, or Turtles, as the
Sea-men call them; but they valued them not,
when they had &s;uch Plenty of Veni&s;on: Al&s;o they
found &s;ome very good Herbs in the I&s;land, which
they boil'd with the Goats Fle&s;h, and which made
their Broth very &s;avoury and comfortable, and
withal very Healing and good again&s;t the
Scurvy, which in tho&s;e Climates <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men are
very &s;ubject to.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="201">
We were now come to the Month of <HI>April</HI>
1715, having &s;pent almo&s;t eight Months in this
trafficking wandering Voyage, from <HI>Manilla</HI>
hither. And whoever &s;hall follow the &s;ame, or
a like Track, if ever &s;uch a Thing &s;hall happen,
will do well to make a Year of it, and may find it
very well worth while.</P>
<P>I doubt not, but there are many undi&s;cover'd
Parts of Land to the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and to the <HI>South</HI>
al&s;o; of the fir&s;t Shore, of which I mention'd,
that we &s;tay'd trafficking for little Bits of Gold.
And tho' it is true, that &s;uch a Traffick, as I
have given an Account of, is very advantageous
in it &s;elf, and worth while to look for; e&s;peci|ally
after having had a good Market for an
outward bound <HI>European</HI> Cargo, according to the
Pattern of ours at the <HI>Phillipines;</HI> and which, by
the Way, they need not mi&s;s; I &s;ay, as this
Trade for Gold would be well worth while, &s;o
had we gone the be&s;t Way, and taken a Cour&s;e
more to the <HI>South</HI> from <HI>Manilla,</HI> not going away
<HI>E.</HI> to the <HI>Ladrones,</HI> we &s;hould certainly have
fallen in with a Country from the Coa&s;t of <HI>New
Guinea,</HI> where we might have found Plenty of
Spices, as well as of Gold.</P>
<P>For why &s;hould we not be allow'd to &s;uppo&s;e,
that the Country on the &s;ame Continent, and
in the &s;ame Latitude, &s;hould produce the
&s;ame Growth? E&s;pecially con&s;idering them &s;itu|ated,
as it may be call'd, in the Neighbourhood
of one another.</P>
<P>Had we then proceeded this Way, no Que|&s;tion,
but we might have fixt on &s;ome Place for
a Settlement, either <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French;</HI> whence a
Corre&s;pondence being e&s;tabli&s;h'd with <HI>Europe,</HI>
either by Cape <HI>Horn Ea&s;t,</HI> or the Cape <HI>De Bona
<PB N="199" REF="202">
E&s;perance We&s;t,</HI> as we had thought fit; they might
have found as great a Production of the Nutmegs,
and the Cloves, as at <HI>Banda,</HI> and <HI>Ternate;</HI> or
have made tho&s;e Productions have been planted
there for the future, where, no doubt, they
would grow and thrive as well, as they do now
in the <HI>Molucco's.</HI></P>
<P>But we &s;pun out too much Time for the
Bu&s;ine&s;s we did and tho' we might, as above,
discover new Places, and get very well too;
yet we did nothing, in Compari&s;on of what we
might be &s;uppos'd to do, had we made the
Di&s;covery more our Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I cannot doubt al&s;o, but that when I &s;tood
away <HI>South,</HI> it was too late; for had I &s;tood
into the Latitude of &s;ixty &s;even at fir&s;t, as I did
afterwards, I have good Rea&s;on to believe, that
tho&s;e I&s;lands, which we call the <HI>Molucco's,</HI> and
which lie &s;o thick, and for &s;o great an Extent,
go on yet farther, and it is &s;carce to be imagin'd,
that they break off ju&s;t with <HI>Gilloto.</HI></P>
<P>This I call a Mi&s;take in me; namely, that I
&s;tood away <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> from the <HI>Phillipines</HI> to the
<HI>Ladrones,</HI> before I had gone any Length to the
<HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to the Cour&s;e &s;et dawn in this
Work, namely, <HI>S. E.</HI> and by <HI>E.</HI> from the &s;aid
<HI>Ladrones,</HI> the Places I have taken Notice of, as
the&s;e, do not, in my Opinion, appear to be
incon&s;iderable, and of no Value; &s;o had we
&s;earch'd farther into them, I doubt not, but
there are greater Things to be di&s;cover'd; and
perhaps, a much greater Extent of Land al&s;o.
For&punc; as I have but ju&s;t, as it were, de&s;crib'd
the Shell, having made no Search after the
Kernel; it is more than probable, that within
<PB N="200" REF="203">
the Country, there might be greater Di&s;coveries
made, of immen&s;e Value&punc; too. For even as I
ob&s;erv'd &s;everal Times, whenever we found
any People that had Gold, and ask'd them, as
well as by Signs we could make them under&s;tand,
they always pointed to the Rivers, and the
Mountains, which lay farther up the Country,
and which we never made any Di&s;covery of;
having little in our View, but the getting what
little Share of Gold, the poor People had about
them. Whereas had we taken a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the Place, and left a Number of Men &s;ufficient
to &s;upport them&s;elves, in making a farther
Search; I cannot doubt, but that there mu&s;t
be a great deal of that, of which the unactive
<HI>Indians</HI> had gotten but a little.</P>
<P>Nor had we any skilful Man among us, to
view the Face of the Earth; and &s;ee what Trea|&s;ure
of choice Vegetables might be there. We had
indeed &s;ix very good Surgeons; and one of
them, who we took in among the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI>
Men, was a Man of very great Reading, and
Judgment; But he acknowledg'd, he had no
Skill in Botanicks, having never made it his
Study.</P>
<P>But, to tell the Truth, our <HI>Doctors</HI> them&s;elves,
<HI>&s;o we call the Surgeons at Sea,</HI> were &s;o taken up in
the Traffick for Gold; that they had no Lei&s;ure
to think of any Thing el&s;e. They did indeed
pick up &s;ome Shells, and &s;ome &s;trange figur'd
Skeletons of Fi&s;hes, and &s;mall Bea&s;ts, and other
Things, which they e&s;teem'd as Rarities; But
they never went a Simpling, as we call it; or
to enquire, what the Earth brought forth that
was rare, and not to be found any where el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="204">
I think likewi&s;e, 'tis worth ob&s;erving, how
the People we met with, where, 'tis probable,
no Ships, much le&s;s <HI>European</HI> Ships, had ever
been; and where they had never convers'd with
Enemies, or with Nations accu&s;tomed to &s;teal
and plunder; I &s;ay, the People, who liv'd thus,
had no Fire, no Rage in their Looks; no jealous
Fears of Strangers doing them Harm; and con|&s;equently
no De&s;ire to do Harm to others. They
had Bows and Arrows indeed, but it was rather
to kill the Deer and Fowls, and to provide
them&s;elves Food, than to offend their Enemies;
for they had none.</P>
<P>When therefore removing from thence, we
came to other and different Nations, who were
ravenous and mi&s;chievous, treacherous and fierce;
we concluded, they had convers'd with other
Nations; either by going to them, or their
Ve&s;&s;els coming there. And to confirm me in
this Opinion, I found, the&s;e fierce fal&s;e <HI>Indians</HI>
had <HI>Canoes</HI> and Boats; &s;ome of one Kind, and
&s;ome of another; by which perhaps, they con|vers'd
with the I&s;lands, or other Nations near
them; and that they al&s;o receiv'd Ships and
Ve&s;&s;els from other Nations; by which they had
&s;everal Occa&s;ions to be upon their Guard; and
learn'd the treacherous and cruel Part from
others; which Nature gave them no Ideas of
before.</P>
<P>As the Natives of the&s;e Places were tractable
and courteous, &s;o they would be made ea&s;i|ly
&s;ub&s;ervient and a&s;&s;i&s;tant to any <HI>European</HI>
Nation that would come to make Settlements
among them; e&s;pecially, if tho&s;e <HI>European</HI> Na|tions
u&s;ed them with Humanity and Courte&s;y;
for I have made it a general Ob&s;ervation con|cerning
<PB N="202" REF="205">
the Natural Di&s;po&s;ition of all the Sa|vage
Nations that ever I met with: That if
they are once but really oblig'd, they will be
always very faithful.</P>
<P>But it is our People, I mean the <HI>Europeans,</HI>
breaking Faith with them, that fir&s;t teaches them
Ingratitude; and inures them to treat their
new Comers with Breach of Faith, and with
Cruelty and Barbarity. If you once win
them by Kindne&s;s, and doing them good, I
mean at fir&s;t, before they are taught to be
Rogues by Example, they will generally be
hone&s;t, and be kind al&s;o to the uttermo&s;t of
their Power.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erv'd, that it has been the
Opinion of all the Sailors, who have navigated
tho&s;e Parts of the World, that farther <HI>South</HI>
there has been great Tracts of undi&s;cover'd
Land; and &s;ome have told us, they have &s;een
them, and have call'd them by &s;uch and &s;uch
Names; as particularly the I&s;les of <HI>Solomon,</HI> of
which yet, we can read of no Body that ever
went on Shore on them, or that could give
any Account of them; except &s;uch as are Ro|mantick,
and not to be depended upon.</P>
<P>But what has been the Rea&s;on why we
have hitherto had nothing but Gue&s;&s;es made
at tho&s;e Things, and that all that has been
&s;aid of &s;uch Lands, has been imperfect? The
Rea&s;on, if I may &s;peak my Opinion, has been,
becau&s;e it is &s;uch a prodigious Run from the
Coa&s;t of <HI>America</HI> to the I&s;lands of the <HI>Ladrones,</HI>
that the few People who have perform'd it,
never dur&s;t venture to go out of the Way of
the Trade Winds, le&s;t they &s;hould not be
able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for wane of Water and Provi|&s;ions;
<PB N="203" REF="206">
and this is particularly the Ca&s;e in the
Voyage from the Coa&s;t of <HI>America</HI> only.</P>
<P>Whereas, to go the Way which I have
mark'd out, had we &s;een a Nece&s;&s;ity, and
that there was no Land to be found to the
<HI>South</HI> of the Tropick, for a Supply of Provi|&s;ions
and fre&s;h Water, it was evident we
could have gone back again from one Place to
another, and have been con&s;tantly &s;upplied;
and this makes it certain al&s;o, that it cannot be
rea&s;onably undertaken by a Ship going from
the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> I mean the Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> to the
<HI>We&s;t:</HI> But from the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> viz. the Spice I&s;lands,
to <HI>America We&s;t,</HI> it may be adventured with
Ea&s;e, as you &s;ee.</P>
<P>It is true, That <HI>William Cornelius Van Schouton</HI>
and <HI>Francis la Mair,</HI> who fir&s;t found the Pa&s;&s;age
into the <HI>South-Sea</HI> by Cape <HI>Horn,</HI> and not to
pa&s;s the Streights of <HI>Magellan;</HI> I &s;ay, they did
keep to the <HI>Southward</HI> of the Tropick, and pa&s;s,
in Part, the &s;ame Way I have here given an
Account of, as by their Journals, which I have
by me at this Time, is apparent.</P>
<P>And it is as true al&s;o, that they did meet
with many I&s;lands and unknown Shores in
tho&s;e Seas, where they got Refre&s;hment, e&s;pe|cially
fre&s;h Water: Perhaps &s;ome of the Places
were the &s;ame I have de&s;crib'd in this Voyage;
but why they never pur&s;ued that Di&s;covery,
or mark'd tho&s;e I&s;lands and Places they got
Refre&s;hments at, &s;o that others, in que&s;t of
Bu&s;ine&s;s, might have touch'd at them, and have
receiv'd the like Benefit, that I can give no
Account of.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="207">
I cannot help being of Opinion, let our Map-makers
place them where they will, that tho&s;e
I&s;lands, where we &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully fi&s;h'd for Oy|&s;ters,
or rather for Pearl, are the &s;ame which
the ancient Geographers have call'd <HI>Solomon</HI>'s
I&s;lands; and tho' they are &s;o far <HI>South,</HI> the
Riches of them may not be the le&s;s; nor
are they more out of the Way. On the
contrary, they lie directly in the Track which
our Navigators would take, if they thought fit
either to go or come between <HI>Europe</HI> and the
<HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> &s;eeing they that come about Cape
<HI>Horn,</HI> &s;eldom go le&s;s <HI>South</HI> than the Latitude
of &s;ixty three to &s;ixty four Degrees; and the&s;e
I&s;lands, as I have &s;aid, lie in the Latitude of
Forty to Forty Eight <HI>South,</HI> and extend them|&s;elves
near one hundred and &s;ixty Leagues in
Breadth from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>Without doubt, tho&s;e i&s;lands would make a
very noble Settlement, in Order to victual
and relieve the <HI>European</HI> Merchants, in &s;o
long a Run as they have to make; and when
this Trade came to be more frequented, the
Calling of tho&s;e Ships there would enrich the
I&s;lands, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at St. <HI>Hellena</HI> are enriched
by the refre&s;hing which the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships
find, that meet there.</P>
<P>But to return to our pre&s;ent Situation, at
St. <HI>Juan Fernando;</HI> the Refre&s;hment which our
Men found here, greatly encourag'd and re|viv'd
them; and the Broths and Stewings
which we made of the Goats Fle&s;h which we
kill'd there, than which, nothing could be
whole&s;omer, re&s;tored all our &s;ick Men; &s;o that
we lo&s;t but two Men in our whole Pa&s;&s;age
from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> and had lo&s;t but eight
<PB N="205" REF="208">
Men in our whole Voyage from <HI>England,</HI> ex|cept
I &s;hould reckon tho&s;e five Men and a Boy
to be lo&s;t, which ran away from us in the
Country among the <HI>Indians,</HI> as I have already
related.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have added, that we careen'd and
clean'd our Ships here, and put our &s;elves into a
Po&s;ture for whatever Adventures might happen;
for, as I re&s;olved upon a Trading Voyage upon
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Chill</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> and a Crui&s;ing Voyage
al&s;o, as it might happen; &s;o, I re&s;olved al&s;o, to
put our Ships into a Condition for both, as Oc|ca&s;ion
&s;hould pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Our Men were nimble, at this Work e&s;pecial|ly,
having been &s;o well refre&s;hed and heart'ned
up, by their extraordinary Supply of fre&s;h Meats,
and the Additions of good Broths and Soops,
which they fed on every Day in the I&s;land, and
with which, they were &s;upplied without any Man|ner
of Limitation, all the while they were at work.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, being their Ca&s;e, they got the <HI>Ma|daga&s;car</HI>
Ship hall'd down, and her Bottom wa&s;h'd
and tallow'd, and &s;he was as clean as when &s;he
fir&s;t came off of the Stocks, in five Days Time;
and &s;he was rigg'd, and all &s;et to rights, and fit
for Sailing in two more.</P>
<P>The great Ship was not &s;o &s;oon fitted, nor was
I in &s;o much Ha&s;te, for I had a De&s;ign in my
Head, which I had not yet communicated to any
Body, and that was to &s;end the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship
a Crui&s;ing, as &s;oon as &s;he was fitted up: Accor|dingly,
I &s;ay, the fifth Day &s;he was ready, and I
managed it &s;o, that the Captain of the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI>
Ship, openly, before all the Men, made the
Motion, as if it had been his own Project, and
<PB N="206" REF="209">
de&s;ired I would let him go and try his Fortune
as he call'd it.</P>
<P>I &s;eemed loth at fir&s;t, but he added to his Im|portunity,
that he and all his Crew were willing
if they made any Purcha&s;e, it &s;hould be divided
among all the Crews, in Shares, according as they
were &s;hipped; that if it was Provi&s;ions the Cap|tain
&s;hould buy it at half Price, for the U&s;e of the
whole, and the Money to be &s;hared.</P>
<P>Well, upon hearing his Propo&s;als, which were
e&s;teemed very ju&s;t, and the Men all agreeing, I
&s;eemed to con&s;ent, and &s;o he had my Orders and
In&s;tructions, and Leave to be out twelve Days on
his Crui&s;e, and away he went; his Ship was an
excellent Sailor, as has been &s;aid, and being now
a very clean Ship, I thought he might &s;peak with
any Thing, or get away from any Thing, if he
plea&s;ed; by the Way, I ordered him to put out
none but <HI>French</HI> Colours.</P>
<P>He crui&s;ed a Week without &s;eeing a Sail, and
&s;tood in quite to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Shore in one Place,
but that he was wrong in; the eighth Day, giv|ing
over all Expectations, he &s;tood off again to
Sea, and the next Morning he &s;py'd a Sail, which
was a large <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship, and which &s;eemed to
&s;tand down directly upon him, which a little
check'd his Forwardne&s;s; however, he kept on
his Cour&s;e, when the <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;eeing him plainer,
than, it &s;eems, he had done at fir&s;t, tack'd, and
crouding all the Sail he could carry, &s;tood in for
the Shore.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard</HI> was a good Sailor, but our Ship
plainly gained upon her, and in the Evening came
almo&s;t up with her; when he &s;aw the Land, tho'
at a great Di&s;tance, and he was loth to be &s;een,
chaceing her, from the Shore; however, he fol|lowed,
<PB N="207" REF="210">
and Night coming on, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> chang'd
his Cour&s;e, thinking to get away, but as the Moon
was ju&s;t ri&s;ing, our Men, who re&s;olved to keep her
in Sight, if po&s;&s;ible, perceived her, and &s;tretch'd
after her with all the Canvas they could lay on.</P>
<P>This Cha&s;e held till about Midnight, when our
Ship coming up with her, took her, after a little
Di&s;pute; they pretended, at fir&s;t, to have nothing
on Board but Timber, which they were carrying,
as they &s;aid, to &s;ome Port for the building of
Ships: But our Men had the Secret to make the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> confe&s;s their Trea&s;ure, if they had any;
&s;o, that after &s;ome hard Words with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Commander, he confe&s;&s;ed he had &s;ome Money on
Board, which on our Mens Promi&s;e of good
U&s;age, he afterwards very hone&s;tly delivered,
and which might amount to obout &s;ixteen Thou|&s;and
Pieces of Eight.</P>
<P>But he had what we were very glad of be&s;ides,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) about two hundred great Jars of very good
Wheat Flower, a large Quantity of Oil, and &s;ome
Casks of Sweet-Meats, all which was to us very
good Prize.</P>
<P>But now our Difficulty was, what we &s;hould do
with the Ship, and with the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and this
was &s;o real a Difficulty, that I began often to wi&s;h
he had not taken her, lea&s;t her being let go, &s;he
&s;hould alarm the Country, or if detained, di&s;co|ver
us all.</P>
<P>It was not above one Day beyond his Orders,
that we had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him come into
the Road, with his Prize in tow, and the Flower
and Oil was a very good Booty to us; but upon
&s;econd and better Thoughts, we brought the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> to a fair Treaty, and, which was more
difficult, brought all our Men to con&s;ent to it.
<PB N="208" REF="211">
The Ca&s;e is this, knowing what I propo&s;ed to my
&s;elf to do, namely, to trade all the Way up the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t, and to pa&s;s for <HI>French</HI> Ships, I knew
the taking this <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship would betray us all,
unle&s;s I re&s;olved to &s;ink the Ship and murther all
the Men, &s;o I came to this Re&s;olution, namely,
to talk with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain, and make Terms
with him, which I &s;oon made him very glad of.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t I pretended to be very angry with the
Captain of the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship, and to have put
him under Confinement, for having made a Prize
of his Catholick Maje&s;ty's Subjects, we being Sub|jects
to the King of <HI>France,</HI> who was in perfect
Peace with the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Then I told him, that I would re&s;tore him his
Ship and all his Money, and as to his Flower and
Oil, which the Men had fallen greedily upon,
having a Want of it, I would pay him the full Va|lne
in Money for it all, and for any other Lo&s;s he
had &s;u&s;tained, only that I would oblige him to lie
in the Road at the I&s;land where we were, till we
returned from our Voyage to <HI>Lima,</HI> whether we
were going to trade, for which lying, I al&s;o a|greed
to pay him Demorage for his Ship, after the
Rate of eight hundred Pieces of Eight <HI>per</HI> Month,
and if I returned not in four Months, he was to
be at his Liberty to go.</P>
<P>The Captain, who thought him&s;elf a Pri&s;oner
and undone, you may be&s;ure, would embrace this
Offer; and &s;o we &s;ecured his Ship till our Return,
and there we found him very hone&s;tly at an An|chor,
of which in its Place.</P>

at lea&s;t as I had intended it, and

<P><PB N="2" REF="213">
I was now to change Faces again, and
Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> appear'd as Captain, al$
Things being tran&s;acted in his Name, and
<HI>French</HI> Captains were put into the <HI>Brigantine</HI>
and into the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship al&s;o: The fir&s;t
Thing the Captain did, was to &s;end a civil
Me&s;&s;age to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governor, to acquaint
him, That being come into tho&s;e Seas as
Friends, under his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's
Commi&s;&s;ion, and with the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s
Permi&s;&s;ion, we de&s;ir'd to be treated as Allies,

for which we would pay ready Money; al&s;o
we carry'd <HI>French</HI> Colours, but took not the
lea&s;t Notice of our Intention to trade with
them.</P>
<P>We received a very civil An&s;wer from
the Governor (<HI>viz.</HI>) That being the King of
<HI>France</HI>'s Subjects, and that they were in Alli|ance
with us, we were very welcome to Wood
and Water, and any Provi&s;ion the Place
would afford; and that our Per&s;ons &s;hould
be &s;afe, and in perfect Liberty to go on Shore,
but that he could not allow any of our Men
to lie on Shore., it being expre&s;s in his Orders,
That he &s;hould not permit any Nation, not
actually in Commi&s;&s;ion from the King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> to come on Shore, and &s;tay there, no
not one Night; and that this was done to
prevent Di&s;orders</P>
<P>We an&s;wered, That we were content with
that Order, &s;eeing we did not de&s;ire our
Men &s;hould go on Shore to &s;tay there, we not

which was frequent among Seamen.</P>
<P>While we continued here, &s;everal <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
came on Board and vi&s;ited us, and
we often went on Shore on the &s;ame Pre|tence;
but our Supra-Cargo, who under|&s;tood
his Bu&s;ine&s;s too well nor to make
u&s;e of the Occa&s;ion, pre&s;ently let the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s
&s;ee, that he had a great Cargo of Goods to
di&s;po&s;e of; they as freely took the Hint, and
let him know, that they had Money enough
to pay for whatever they bought; &s;o they
fell to work, and they bought <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> and
<HI>China</HI> Silks, <HI>Japan</HI> Ware, <HI>China</HI> Ware, Spice,
and &s;omething of every thing we had. We
knew we &s;hould not &s;ell all our Cargo here,
nor any extraordinary Quantity; but we
knew, on the other Hand, that what we did
&s;ell here, we &s;hould &s;ell for One hundred
Pounds <HI>per Cent,</HI> extraordinary: I mean,
more than we &s;hould &s;ell for at <HI>Lima,</HI> or any
other Ports on that Side, and &s;o we did; for
here we &s;old a Bottle of Arrack for Four
Pieces of eight; a Pound of Cloves for Five
Pieces of Eight, and a Pound of Nutmegs for
Six Pieces of Eight; and the like of other
Things.</P>
<P>They would gladly have purchas'd &s;ome
<HI>European</HI> Goods, and e&s;pecially <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth
and Bays But as we had, indeed, very few
&s;uch Things left, &s;o we were not willing
they &s;hould &s;ee them, that they might not
have any Su&s;picion of our being <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men,
and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, which would &s;oon have
put an End to all our Commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="215">
While we lay here trafficking with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
I &s;et &s;ome of my Men to work,
to conver&s;e among the Native <HI>Chilians</HI> or <HI>In|dians,</HI>
as we call them, of the Country, and
&s;everal things they learn'd of them according
to the In&s;tructions which I gave them; for
Example; Fir&s;t, I under&s;tood by them, That
the Country People who do not live among
the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> have a mortal Aver&s;ion to them;
that it is riveted in their Minds by Tradi|tion,
from Father to Son, ever &s;ince the
Wars which had formerly been among them;
and that though they did not now carry on
tho&s;e Wars, yet the Animo&s;ity remained, and
the Pride and cruel haughty Temper of
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> was &s;uch &s;till to tho&s;e of the
Country People, who came under their Go|vernment,
as makes that Aver&s;ion continu|ally
increa&s;e. They let us know, That if
any Nation in the World would but come
in, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and
&s;upport them in their Ri&s;ing again&s;t them,
they would &s;oon rid their Hands of the whole
Nation. This was to the Purpo&s;e, exactly,
as to what I wanted to know.</P>
<P>I then ordered particular Enquiry to be
made, Whether the Mountains of <HI>Andes</HI>
(which are, indeed, prodigious to look at,
and &s;o frightful for their Height, that 'tis
not to be thought of without &s;ome Horror)
were in any Places pa&s;&s;able? what Country
there was beyond them? and whether any of
their People had gone over and knew the
Pa&s;&s;age?</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="216">
The <HI>Indians</HI> concurr'd with the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
in this (for our Men enquir'd of both) That
though the <HI>Andes</HI> were to be &s;uppo&s;ed, indeed,
to be the highe&s;t Mountains in the World,
and that, generally &s;peaking, they were un|pa&s;&s;able,
yet that there had been Pa&s;&s;ages
found by the Vales among the Mountains;
where, with fetching &s;everal Compa&s;&s;es and
Windings, partly on the Hills, and partly
in the Valley$s, Men went, with a great deal
of Ea&s;e and Safety, quite through or over, call
it as we will, to the other called the <HI>Ea&s;t-&s;ide,</HI>
and as often returned again.</P>
<P>Some of the more knowing <HI>Indians</HI> or <HI>Chi|lians</HI>
went farther than this, and when our
Men enquired after the Manner, Situation
and Produce of the Country on the other
Side, they told them, That when they pa&s;s'd
the Mountains from that Part of the Coun|try,
they went chiefly to fetch Cattle, and
kill Deer, of which there were great Num|bers
in that Part of the Land; But that
when they went from St. <HI>Jago,</HI> they turned
away <HI>North</HI> &s;ome Leagues, when they came
to a Town called St. <HI>Anthonio de los Vejos,</HI> or,
The Town of St. <HI>Anthony</HI> and the old Men;
That there was a great River at that City,
from whence they found Means to go down
to the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> and &s;o to the <HI>Buenos
Ayres;</HI> and that they frequently carried thi|ther
great Sums of Money in <HI>Chilian</HI> Gold,
and brought back <HI>European</HI> Goods from
thence.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="217">
I had all I wanted now, and bad my
Men &s;ay no more to them of that, only tell
them, That they would come back, and
would travel a little that Way to &s;ee the
Country: The People appeared very well
plea&s;ed with that, a&s;&s;uring them, That if
they would do &s;o, they &s;hould find &s;ome,
as well <HI>Spaniards</HI> as <HI>Chilians,</HI> who would be
Guides to them thro' the Hills; al&s;o a&s;&s;uring
them, That they would find the Hills very
practicable, and the People, as they went
along, very ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t and furni&s;h them
with whatever they found they wanted, e&s;pe|cially
if they come to know that they were
not <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or that they would protect
them from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which would be
the mo&s;t agreeable Thing to them in the
World; for it &s;eems many of the Nations of
the <HI>Chilians,</HI> had been driven to live in the
Hills, and &s;ome even beyond them, to avoid
the Cruelty and Tyranny of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
e&s;pecially in the Beginning of their planting
in that Country.</P>
<P>The next Enquiry I ordered them to make,
was, Whether it was po&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s tho&s;e
Hills with Hor&s;es, or Mules, or any kind of
Carriages? and they a&s;&s;ured them, They
might travel with Mules, and even with
Hor&s;es al&s;o, but rather with Mules; but as
to Carriages, &s;uch as Carts, or Waggons,
they allowed, that was not practicable. They
a&s;&s;ured us, That &s;ome of tho&s;e Ways thro'
the Hills were much frequented; and that
there were Towns, or Villages rather, of Peo|ple,
to be found in the Valleys between
<PB N="7" REF="218">
the &s;aid Hills; &s;ome of which Villages,
were very large, and the Soil very rich and
fruitful, bearing &s;ufficient Provi&s;ions for the
Inhabitants, who were very numerous. They
told us, The People were not much inclin'd
to live in Towns as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do, but
that they liv'd &s;catter'd up and down the
Country, as they were guided by the Good|ne&s;s
of the Land; that they liv'd very &s;ecure
and unguarded, never offering any injury to
one another, nor fearing injury from any, but
the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>I caus'd the&s;e Enquiries to be made with
the utmo&s;t Prudence and Caution, &s;o that the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> had not the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of our
De&s;ign; and thus having fini&s;hed our Traf|fick,
and taken in Water and Provi&s;ions, we
&s;ailed from <HI>Baldivia,</HI> having &s;ettled a little
Corre&s;pondence there with <HI>Two Spaniards,</HI>
who were very faithful to us; and with
Two <HI>Chilian Indians,</HI> who we had, in a par|ticular
Manner, engaged, and who, to make
&s;ure of, we took along with us; and hav|ing
&s;pent about Thirteen Days here, and taken
the Value of about Six thou&s;and Pieces of
Eight in Silver or Gold, but mo&s;t of it in
Gold, we &s;et Sail.</P>
<P>Our next Port was the Bay of the <HI>Con|ception:</HI>
Here, having Two or Three Men on
Board, who were well acquainted with the
Coa&s;t, we run boldly into the Bay, and
came to an Anchor in that which they call
the Bite, or little Bay, under the I&s;land <HI>Qui|riquina;</HI>
and from thence we &s;ent our Boat,
with <HI>French</HI> Mariners to row, and a <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="219">
Coxon, with a Letter to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gover|nor,
from Captain <HI>Merlote.</HI> Our Pretence
was always the &s;ame as before, That we had
his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and that we de&s;ired Liberty to Wood and
Water, and to buy Provi&s;ions, having been a
very long Voyage, and the like.</P>
<P>Under tho&s;e Pretences, we lay here about
Ten Days, and drove a very con&s;iderable
Trade for &s;uch Goods as we were &s;ure they
wanted; and having taken about the Value
of Eight thou&s;and Pieces of Eight, we &s;et Sail
for the Port or River that goes up to St. <HI>Jago,</HI>
where we expected a very good Market, be|ing
di&s;tant from the <HI>Conception</HI> about Sixty-five
Leagues.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Jago</HI> is the Capital City of <HI>Chily,</HI> and
&s;tands Twelve Leagues within the Land;
there are Two Ports, which are made u&s;e
of to carry on the Traffick of this Place,
<HI>viz. R. de Ropocalmo,</HI> and Port <HI>de Valpari&s;o.</HI>
We were bound to the la&s;t, as being the only
Port for Ships of Burthen, and where there
is Security from bad Weather.</P>
<P>We found means here, without going up to
the City of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> to have Merchants
enough to come down to us; for this being a
very rich City, and full of Money, we
found all our valuable Silks of <HI>China,</HI> our
<HI>Atla&s;'s, China</HI> Dama&s;ks, Satins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were
very much valued, and very much wanted,
and no Price was too high for us to a&s;k for
them; for in a Word, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies,
who, for Pride, do not come behind any in
the World, whatever they do for Beauty,
<PB N="9" REF="220">
were &s;o eager for tho&s;e fine Things, that,
almo&s;t, any rea&s;onable Quantity might have
been &s;old there; but the Truth is, We had an
unrea&s;onable Quantity, and therefore, as we
had other Markets to go to, we did not let
them know what a great Stock o$ Goods we
had, but took care they had &s;omething of
every thing they wanted: We likewi&s;e found
our Spices were an excellent Commodity in
tho&s;e Parts, and fold for a mon&s;trous Profit
too, as, indeed, every thing el&s;e did al&s;o, as
above.</P>
<P>We found it very ea&s;y to &s;ell here to the Va|lue
of One hundred and thirty thou&s;and Pieces
of Eight, in all &s;orts of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
Goods; for &s;till, though we had &s;ome of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cargo loo&s;e, we let none of it be &s;een,
We took mo&s;t of the Money in Gold un|coin'd,
which they get out of the Moun|tains
in great Quantities, and of which we
&s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak more hereafter.</P>
<P>Our next trading Port was <HI>Coquimbo,</HI> a
&s;mall Town, but a good Port; Here we went
in without Ceremony, and upon the &s;ame
Foot, of being <HI>French,</HI> were well received,
traded underhand with the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchants,
and got Letters to &s;ome other Merchants at
<HI>Gua&s;co,</HI> a Port in a little Bay about Fifteen
Leagues <HI>North</HI> from <HI>Coquimbo.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, to the Port of <HI>Copiapo,</HI> is
Twenty-five Leagues: Here we found very
good Port, though no trading Town or City;
but the Country being well inhabited, we
found Means to acquaint &s;ome of the princi|pal
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Country, of what we
<PB N="10" REF="221">
were, and (with which they were plea&s;ed well
enough) That they might trade with us
for &s;uch Things, which it was ea&s;y to &s;ee,
they gave double Price for to the Merchants
who came from <HI>Lima,</HI> and other Places: This
brought them to us with &s;o much Eagerne&s;s,
that though they bought for their own U&s;e,
not for Sale, yet they came furni&s;hed with
Orders, perhaps, for Two or Three Families
together, and being generally rich, would
frequently lay out Six hundred, or Eight;
hundred Pieces of Eight a Man &s;o that we
had a mo&s;t excellent Market here, and took
above Thirty thou&s;and Pieces of Eight that
is to &s;ay, The Value of it, for they &s;till
paid all in Gold.</P>
<P>Here we had Opportunity to get a Quan|tity
of good Flower, or Wheat Meal, of very
good <HI>European</HI> Wheat; that is to &s;ay, Of
that &s;ort of Wheat; and withal, had good
Bi&s;ket baked on Shore, &s;o that now we got a
large Recruit of Bread, and our Men began to
make Puddings, and liv'd very comfortably;
likewi&s;e we got good Sugar at the Ingenioes,
or Sugar-Mills, of which there were &s;everal
here, and the farther <HI>North</HI> we went, their
Number increa&s;ed, for we were now in the
Latitude of Twenty-eight Degrees Two Min.
<HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>We had but one Port now, of any Con&s;e|quence,
that we intended to touch at, 'till
we came to the main Place we aim'd at,
which was <HI>Lima,</HI> and this was about Two
thirds of the Way thither I mean <HI>Porto Rica,</HI>
or <HI>Arica;</HI> this was in the Latitude of Eigh|teen
<PB N="11" REF="222">
Degrees, or thereabouts: They were very
&s;hy of us here, as having been much upon
their Guard for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, for fear
of <HI>Buccaniers,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Privateers; but
when they under&s;tood we were <HI>French,</HI> and
our French Captain &s;ent Two Recommenda|tions
to them from a Merchant at St. <HI>Jago,</HI>
they were then very well &s;atisfy'd, and we
had full Freedom of Commerce here al&s;o.</P>
<P>From hence we came the highth of <HI>Lima,</HI> the
Capital Port, if not the Capital City, of <HI>Peru,</HI> ly|ing
in the Latitude of Twelve Degrees Thirty
Minutes. Had we made the lea&s;t Pretence
of trading here, we &s;hould, at lea&s;t, have had
Soldiers put on Board our Ships to have
prevented it, and the People would have
been forbidden to trade with us upon Pain
of Death; but Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> having
brought Letters to a principal Merchant of
<HI>Lima,</HI> he in&s;tructed him how to manage
him&s;elf at his fir&s;t coming into the Port;
which was to ride without the Town of <HI>Callao,</HI>
out of the Command of the Puntals or Ca&s;tles
there, and not to come any nearer, upon
what Occa&s;ion &s;oever, and then to leave the
re&s;t to him.</P>
<P>Upon this the Merchant applied him&s;elf
to the Governor for leave to go on Board
the <HI>French</HI> Ship at <HI>Callao;</HI> the Governor under|&s;tood
him, and would not grant it by any
means; the Rea&s;on was, Becau&s;e there had
been &s;uch a general Complaint by the Mer|chants
from <HI>Chartagena, Porto Bello,</HI> and other
Places, of the great Trade carried on here
with <HI>French</HI> Ships from <HI>Europe,</HI> to the De&s;tru|ction
<PB N="12" REF="223">
of the Merchants, and to the Ruin
of the Trade of the Galleons, that the Go|vernor,
or Viceroy of <HI>Peru,</HI> had forbid the
<HI>French</HI> Ships landing any Goods.</P>
<P>Now, though this made our Traffick im|practicable
at <HI>Lima</HI> it&s;elf, yet it did, by no
Means, hinder the Merchants trading with
us under Cover, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but e&s;pecially when they
came to under&s;tand, that we were not loaden
from <HI>Europe,</HI> with Bays, long Ells, Druggets,
broad Cloth, Serges, Stuffs, Stockings, Hats,
and &s;uch like Woollen Manufactures of
<HI>France, England, &amp;c.</HI> but that our Cargo was
the &s;ame with that of the <HI>Manilla</HI> Ships at
<HI>Acapulco;</HI> and that we were loaden with <HI>Calli|coes,</HI>
Mu&s;lins, fine wrought <HI>China</HI> Silks, Da|ma&s;ks,
<HI>Japan</HI> Ware, <HI>China</HI> Ware, Spices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
there was then no with-holding them, but
they came on Board us in the Night with
Canoes, and &s;taying all Day, went on Shore
again in the Night, carrying their Goods to
different Places, where they knew they could
convey them on Shore without Difficulty.</P>
<P>In this Manner we traded publickly
enough, not much unlike the Manner of our
Trade at the <HI>Manillaes;</HI> and here we effe|ctually
clear'd our&s;elves of our whole Cargo,
as well <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods, as <HI>Indian,</HI> to an im|men&s;e
Sum. Here our Men, Officers as well
as Seamen, &s;old their fine Pearl, particularly
one large Parcel, containing One hundred
Seventy-three very fine Pearls, but of differ|ent
Sizes, which a Prie&s;t bought, <HI>as we were
told,</HI> to dre&s;s up the Image of the ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin
<HI>Mary,</HI> in one of their Churches.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="224">
In a Word, We came to a Ballance here;
for we &s;old every thing, that we had the lea&s;t
Intention to part with, the chief things we kept
in Re&s;erve were, &s;ome Bales of Engli&s;h Goods;
al&s;o all the Remainder of our Beads and
Bugles, Toys, Iron-work, Knives, Scizars,
Hatchets, Needles, Pins, Gla&s;s Ware, and
&s;uch Things as we knew the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did
not regard, and which might be u&s;eful in our
farther De&s;igns, of which my Head was &s;till
very full. Tho&s;e, I &s;ay, We kept &s;till.</P>
<P>Here, likewi&s;e, we &s;old our <HI>Brigantine,</HI>
which, though an excellent Sea-boat, as may well
be &s;uppos'd, con&s;idering the long Voyage
we had made in her, was yet &s;o Worm-eaten
in&punc; her Bottom, that unle&s;s we would have
new &s;heath'd her, and, perhaps, &s;hifted mo&s;t
of her Planks too, which would have taken
up a great deal of Time; &s;he was, by no
Means, fit to have gone any further, at lea&s;t,
not &s;o long a Run as we had now to make,
(<HI>viz</HI>) round the whole <HI>Southern</HI> Part of
<HI>America;</HI> I and where we &s;hould find no Port
to put in at (I mean, Where we &s;hould have
been able to have got any thing done for the
Repair of a Ship) 'till we had come home to
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It was propo&s;ed here, To have gone to
the Governor or Viceroy of <HI>Peru,</HI> and have
obtained his Licen&s;e or Pa&s;s, to have travers'd
the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> from Port St. <HI>Maria,</HI>
to the River of <HI>Darien;</HI> this we could ea&s;ily
have obtain'd under the Character that we
then bore (<HI>viz.</HI>) of having the King of
<HI>France</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion, and had we been really
<PB N="14" REF="225">
all <HI>French,</HI> I believe I &s;hould have done it; but
as we were &s;o many Engli&s;h Men, and as &s;uch
were then at open War with <HI>Spain,</HI> I did
not think it a &s;afe Adventure, I mean, not
a rational Adventure, e&s;pecially con&s;idering
what a con&s;iderable Trea&s;ure we had with
us.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, As we were now a
&s;trong Body of able Sea-men, and had Two
&s;tout Ships under us, we had no Rea&s;on to
apprehend either the Toil or the Danger of
a Voyage round <HI>Cape Horn,</HI> after which, we
&s;hould be in a very good Condition to make
the re&s;t of our Voyage to <HI>England;</HI> whereas,
if we travell'd over the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> we
&s;hould be all like a Company of Freebooters,
and Buccaneers, loo&s;e and un&s;hipp'd, and
&s;hould, perhaps, run &s;ome one Way, and
&s;ome another, among the Log-wood Cutters
at the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and other Places,
to get Pa&s;&s;age, &s;ome to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and &s;ome to
<HI>New England;</HI> and, which was wor&s;e than
all, &s;hould be expo&s;ed to a Thou&s;and Dan|gers
on Account of the Trea&s;ure we had
with us, perhaps, even to that of murthering
and robbing one another; and, as Captain
<HI>Merlote</HI> &s;aid, who was really a <HI>French</HI> Man&punc;
It were much more eligible for us, as <HI>French,</HI>
or if we had been &s;uch, to have gone up to
<HI>Acapulco,</HI> and there to &s;ell our Ships, and get
Licen&s;e to travel to <HI>Mexico,</HI> and then to have
got the Viceroy's <HI>A&s;&s;iento,</HI> to have come to <HI>Eu|rope</HI>
in the Galleons; but as we were &s;o many
<HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> it was impracticable; our Seamen
al&s;o being Prote&s;tants, <HI>&s;uch as Seamen gene|rally
<PB N="15" REF="226">
are,</HI> and bold mad Fellows, they would
never have carry'd on a Di&s;gui&s;e, both of
their Nation, and of their Religion, for &s;o
long a Time as it would have been nece&s;&s;ary
to do for &s;uch a Journey and Voyage.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides all the&s;e Difficulties, I had
other Projects in my Head, which made me
again&s;t all the Propo&s;als of pa&s;&s;ing by Land
to the <HI>North-Sea;</HI> otherwi&s;e, had I re&s;olved
it, I &s;hould not have much concern'd my&s;elf
about obtaining a Licen&s;e from the <HI>Spaniards;</HI>
for, as we were a &s;ufficient Number of Men
to have forced our Way, we &s;hould not much
have &s;tood upon their giving us leave, or not
giving us leave, to go.</P>
<P>But, as I have &s;aid, my Views lay another
Way, and my Head had been long working
upon the Di&s;cour&s;e my Men had had with the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> at <HI>Baldivia;</HI> I frequently talk'd
with the Two <HI>Chilian Indians</HI> which I had
on Board, and who &s;poke <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> pretty well,
and who we had taught to &s;peak a little
<HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>I had taken care that they &s;hould have all
the good U&s;age imaginable on Board; I had
given them each a very good Suit of Cloaths,
made by our Taylor, but after their own
Manner, with each of them a Bays Cloak;
and had given them Hats, Shoes, Stockings,
and every thing they de&s;ir'd, and they were
mighty well pleas'd, and I talk&punc; d very freely
with them about the Pa&s;&s;age of the Mountains,
for that was now my grand De&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="227">
While I was coming up the <HI>Chilian</HI> Shore,
as you have heard, that is to &s;ay, At St. <HI>Jago,</HI>
at the <HI>Conception,</HI> at <HI>Arica,</HI> and even at <HI>Lima</HI>
it&s;elf, we enquir'd, on all Occa&s;ions, into the
Situation of the Country, the Manner of tra|velling,
and what kind of Country it was be|yond
the Mountains? and we found them all
agreeing in the &s;ame Story; and that pa&s;&s;ing
the Mountains of <HI>Les Cordelieras,</HI> for <HI>&s;o they
call them in</HI> Peru, <HI>though it was the &s;ame Ridge
of Hills as we call the</HI> Andes, was no &s;trange
Thing; that there were not One or Two, but
a great many Places found out, where they
pa&s;s'd as well with Hor&s;es and Mules, as on
Foot, and even &s;ome with Carriages; and in
particular, they told us at <HI>Lima,</HI> That from
<HI>Pota&s;i,</HI> and the Towns thereabouts, there was
a long Valley, which ran for One hundred and
Sixty Leagues in Length <HI>Southward,</HI> and
<HI>S. E.</HI> and that it continued, 'till, the Hills
parting, it opened into the main level Coun|try
on the other Side; and that there were
&s;everal Rivers which began in that great
Valley, and which all of them run away
to the <HI>S.</HI> and the <HI>S. E.</HI> and afterwards, went
away <HI>E.</HI> and <HI>E. N. E.</HI> and &s;o fell into the
great <HI>Rio de la Plata</HI> and empty'd them&s;elves
into the <HI>North-Seas;</HI> and that Merchants
travell'd to tho&s;e Rivers, and then went
down in Boats its far as the Town or City of
the <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> and the <HI>Buenos Ayres.</HI></P>
<P>This was very &s;atisfying, you may be
&s;ure, e&s;pecially to hear them agree in it, that
the <HI>Andes</HI> were to be pa&s;&s;ed (though pa&s;&s;ing
them hereabouts, where, I knew, the main
<PB N="17" REF="228">
Land from the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Shore, where we now
were, mu&s;t be at lea&s;t One thou&s;and Five
hundred Miles broad) was no Part of my Pro|ject;
but I laid up all the&s;e Things in my
Head, and re&s;olv'd to go away to the <HI>South</HI>
again, and act as I &s;hould &s;ee Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>We were now got into a very hot Climate,
and, whatever was the Cau&s;e, my Men began
to grow very &s;ickly, and that to &s;uch a
Degree, that I was once afraid we had got
the Plague among us;, but our Surgeons, who
we all call Doctors at Sea, a&s;&s;ured me, There
was nothing of that among them, and yet
we buried Seventeen Men here, and had be|tween
Twenty and Thirty more &s;ick, and,
as I thought, dangerou&s;ly too.</P>
<P>In this Extremity, for I was really very
much concerned about it, one of my Doctors
came to me, and told me, He had been at
the City (that is at <HI>Lima</HI>) to buy &s;ome Drugs
and Medicines to recruit his Che&s;t, and he
had fallen into Company with an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Je&s;uit,
who he found was an extraordinary good
Phy&s;ician, and that he had had &s;ome Di&s;|cour&s;e
with him about our &s;ick Men, and,
he believed, for a good Word or Two, he
could per&s;uade him to come and vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>I was very loth to con&s;ent to it, for,
&s;ays I to the Surgeon, If he is an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Man,
he &s;peaks <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and he will pre&s;ently per|ceive,
that we are all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, and &s;o
we &s;hall be betray'd; all our De&s;igns will
be blown up at once, and our farther Mea|&s;ures
be all broken, and therefore I would
not con&s;ent: This I did not &s;peak from the
<PB N="18" REF="229">
Fear of any Hurt they could have done me
by Force, for I had no Rea&s;on to value that,
being able to have fought my Way, clear out
of their Seas, if I had been put to it; But, as
I had traded all the Way by Stratagem, and
had many con&s;iderable Views &s;till behind, I
was unwilling to be di&s;appointed by the Di&s;|covery
of my Schemes; or that the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
&s;hould know upon what a double Foundation
I acted, and how I was a <HI>French</HI> Ally and
Merchant, or an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Enemy and Pri|vateer,
ju&s;t as I pleas'd, and as Opportunity
&s;hould offer; in which ca&s;e they would have
been &s;ure to have trapann'd me, if po&s;&s;ible,
under the Pretence or the former, and have
u&s;ed me, if they ever &s;hould get an Advan|tage
over me, as one of the latter.</P>
<P>This made me very cautious, and I had
good Rea&s;on for it too, and yet the Sickne&s;s
and Danger of my Men pre&s;s'd me very hard
to have the Advice of a good Phy&s;ician, if
it was po&s;&s;ible; and e&s;pecially to be &s;atis|fied
whether it was really the Plague or no;
for I was very unea&s;y about that.</P>
<P>But my Surgeon told me, That as to my
Apprehen&s;ion of Di&s;covery he would under|take
to prevent it by this Method; Fir&s;t,
he &s;aid, He found that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Man did
not under&s;tand <HI>French</HI> at all, and &s;o I had
nothing to do but to order, That when he
came on Board, as little <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould be
&s;poke in his Hearing as po&s;&s;ible; and this was
not difficult, for almo&s;t all our Men had a
little <HI>French</HI> at their Tongues End, by hav|ing
&s;o many <HI>French</HI> Men on Board of them;
<PB N="19" REF="230">
others had the <HI>Levant Jargon,</HI> which they
call <HI>Lingua Frank,</HI> &s;o that, if they had but
due Caution, it could not be &s;uddenly per|ceived
what Country-men they were.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, the Surgeon ordered, That
as &s;oon as the <HI>Padre</HI> came on Board, he
&s;hould be &s;urrounded with <HI>French</HI> Seamen
only, &s;ome of which &s;hould be ordered to
follow him from Place to Place, and chop in
with their nimble Tongues, upon &s;ome Oc|ca&s;ion
or other, &s;o that he &s;hould hear <HI>French</HI>
&s;poken where-ever he turn'd him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Upon this, which, indeed, appeared very
ea&s;y to be done, I agreed to let the Doctor
come on Board, and accordingly the Surgeon
brought him the next Day, where Captain
<HI>Merlote</HI> received him in the Cabbin, and
treated him very hand&s;omly, but nothing
was &s;poken but <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Spani&s;h;</HI> and the
Surgeon, who had pretended him&s;elf to be an
<HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Man, acted as Interpreter between the
Doctor and us.</P>
<P>Here we told him the Ca&s;e of our Men
that were &s;ick; &s;ome of them, indeed, were
<HI>French,</HI> and others that could &s;peak <HI>French,</HI>
were in&s;tructed to &s;peak to him, as if they
could &s;peak no other Tongue, and them the
Surgeon interpreted; others who were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI>
were call'd <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Men, and Two or three
were allowed to be Engi&s;h Sea-men, pick'd
up in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> as we had Sea-men, we
told him, of all Nations.</P>
<P>The Matter, in &s;hort, was &s;o carry'd, that
the good Man, for &s;uch I really think he
was, had no manner of Su&s;picion; and, to
<PB N="20" REF="231">
do him Ju&s;tice, He was an admirable Phy|&s;ician,
and did oar Men a great deal o
good; for all of them, but Three, recovered
under his Hands, and tho&s;e Three had reco|vered,
if they had not, like mad Men, dranl
Punch when they were almo&s;t well, and by
their Intemperance, inflam'd their Blood, and
thereby thrown them&s;elves back again into
their Fever, and put them&s;elves, as the <HI>Padre</HI>
&s;aid of them, out of the Reach of <HI>Medicine.</HI></P>
<P>We treated this Man of Art with a great
deal of Re&s;pect, made him &s;ome very hand|&s;ome
Pre&s;ents, and particularly &s;uch as he
could not come at in the Country where he
was; be&s;ides which, I ordered he &s;hould have
the Value of One hundred Dollars in Gold
given him; but he, on the other Hand, thank|ing
Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> for his Bounty, would
have no Money; but he accepted a Pre&s;ent of
&s;ome Linen, a few Handkerchiefs, &s;ome Nut|megs,
and a Piece of Black Bays, mo&s;t of
which, however, he &s;aid, he made Pre&s;ents of
again in the City among &s;ome of his Ac|quaintance.</P>
<P>But he had a farther De&s;ign in his Head,
which afterwards he communicated in Con|fidence
to the Surgeon I have mentioned,
who convers'd with him, and by him to me,
and which was to him, indeed, of the highe&s;t
Importance. The Ca&s;e was this;</P>
<P>He takes our Surgeon on Shore with him
one Day from the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship, where he
had been with him to vi&s;it &s;ome of our &s;ick
Men, and drinking a Gla&s;s of Wine with
him, he told him, He had a Favour to a&s;k
<PB N="21" REF="232">
of him, and a Thing to reveal to him in
Confidence, which was of the utmo&s;t Con|&s;equence
to him&s;elf, though of no great Value
to him (the Surgeon) and if he would pro|mi&s;e
the utmo&s;t Secrecy to him on his Faith
and Honour, he would put his Life into
his Hands, <HI>For, Seignior,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>it will be
no le&s;s, nor would any thing le&s;s than my Life,
&s;ays he, pay for it, if you &s;hould di&s;cover it to
any</HI> of the People here, or any where el&s;e on
this Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Surgeon was a very hone&s;t Man, and
carry'd, indeed, the Index of it in his Face,
and the <HI>Padre</HI> &s;aid afterwards, He inclin'd
to put this Confidence in him, becau&s;e he
thought he &s;aw &s;omething of an hone&s;t Man
in his very Countenance: After &s;o frank a
Beginning, the Surgeon made no Scruple to
tell him, That &s;eeing he inclin'd to treat him
with &s;uch Confidence, and to put a Tru&s;t of
&s;o great Importance in him, he would give
him all the A&s;&s;urance that was in his Power,
that he would be as faithful to him, as it
was po&s;&s;ible to be to him&s;elf; and that the
Secret &s;hould never go out of his Mouth to
any one in the World, but to &s;uch, and at
&s;uch Time, as he &s;hould con&s;ent to and di|rect.
In &s;hort, He u&s;ed &s;o many &s;olemn Pro|te&s;tations,
that the <HI>Padre</HI> made no Scruple
to tru&s;t him with the Secret, which, indeed,
was no le&s;s than putting his Life into his
Hands: The Ca&s;e was this. Me told him, He
had heard them talk of going to <HI>Ireland</HI> in
their Return, and as he had been Thirty
Years out of his own Country, in &s;uch a
<PB N="22" REF="233">
remote Part of the World, where it was never
likely, that he &s;hould ever &s;ee it again, the
Notion he had entertain'd, that this Ship
was going thither, and might &s;et him o$
Shore there, that he might once more &s;ee his
Native Country, and his Family and Friends,
had &s;ill'd his Mind with &s;uch a &s;urprizing
Joy, that he could no longer contain him|&s;elf
and that, therefore, if he would procure
Leave of the Captain, that he might come
privately on Board, and take his Pa&s;&s;age
home, he would willingly pay whatever the
Captain &s;hould de&s;ire of him; but that it
mu&s;t be done with the greate&s;t Secrecy ima|ginable,
or el&s;e he was undone for that if
he &s;hould be di&s;covered and &s;topp'd, he &s;hould
be confin'd in the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> Hou&s;e there, as
long as he liv'd.</P>
<P>The Surgeon told him, The Thing was
ea&s;y to be done, if he would give him leave to
acquaint one Man in the Ship with it, which
was not Captain <HI>Merlote,</HI> but a certain <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Man, who was a con&s;iderable Per&s;on in
the Ship, without whom the Captain did
nothing, and who would be more &s;ecure to
tru&s;t, by far, than Captain <HI>Merlote.</HI> The
<HI>Padre</HI> told him, That without asking him
any Rea&s;ons, &s;ince he had put his Life in
his Hands, he would tru&s;t him with the
Management of it, and therefore left it in|tirely
to him.</P>
<P>The Surgeon accordingly brought him on
Board to me, and making a Confidence of
the whole Matter to me, I turn'd to the
<HI>Padre,</HI> and told him in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> giving him
<PB N="23" REF="234">
my Hand, That I would be under all the
Engagements and Promi&s;es of Secrecy, that
our Surgeon had been in, for his Security
and Satisfaction; That he had merited too
well of us, for us to wi&s;h him any Ill; and,
in &s;hort, That the whole Ship &s;hould be en|gag'd
for his Security. I told him, That as
to his coming on Board, and bringing any
thing off that belonged to him, he mu&s;t take
his own Mea&s;ures, and an&s;wer to him&s;elf for
the Succe&s;s; but that after he was on Board,
we would &s;ink the Ship under him, or blow
her up into the Air, before we would deliver
him up, on any Account whatever.</P>
<P>He was &s;o pleas'd with my frank Way of
talking to him, that he told me, He would
put his Life into my Hands, with the &s;ame
Freedom as he had done before with my Sur|geon;
&s;o we began to concert Mea&s;ures for
his coming on Board with Secrecy.</P>
<P>He told us, There was no need of any Pro|po&s;als,
for he would acquaint the Head of
their Hou&s;e, that he intended to go on board
the <HI>French</HI> Ship in the Road, and to go to
St. <HI>Jogo,</HI> where he had &s;everal Times been in
the &s;ame manner; and that, as they had not
the lea&s;t Su&s;picion or him, he was very well
&s;atisfied, that they would make no Scruple
of it.</P>
<P>But his Mi&s;take in this might have been
his Ruin; for tho' had it been a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship,
they wou'd not have mi&s;tru&s;ted him, vet
when he nam'd the <HI>French</HI> Ship in the Road
of <HI>Callao,</HI> they began to que&s;tion him very
&s;martly about it: Upon which he was oblig'd
<PB N="24" REF="235">
to tell them, That &s;ince they were
doubtful of him, he would not go at all,
telling them withal, That it was hard &s;u&s;|pect
him who had been &s;o faithful to his
Vows, as to re&s;ide for near Thirty Years
among them, when he might frequently have
made an E&s;cape from them, if he had been
&s;o di&s;po&s;ed. So for Three or Four Days he
made no Appearance of going at all; but
having had private Notice from me the Even|ing
before we &s;ail'd, he found Means to get
out of their Hands, came down to <HI>Callao</HI> on
a Mule in the Night, and our Surgeon lying
ready with our Boat about half a League
from the Town, as by Appointment, he took
him on Board, with a Negro his Servant,
and brought him &s;afe to the Ship: Nor had
we receiv'd him on Board half an Hour, but,
being unmoored and ready to &s;ail, we put
out to Sea, and carry'd him clear off.</P>
<P>He made his Excu&s;es to me, That he was
come away naked, according to his Profe&s;|&s;ion;
that he had purpo&s;ed to have furni&s;h'd
him&s;elf with &s;ome Provi&s;ions for the Voyage,
but that the unexpected Su&s;picions of the
Head of their College, or Hou&s;e, had oblig'd
him to come away in a Manner that would
not admit of it; for that he might rather be
&s;aid to have made his E&s;cape, than to have
been come fairly off.</P>
<P>I told him, He was very welcome; (And in|deed
&s;o he was, for he had been already
more worth to us than ten times his Pa&s;&s;age
came to) and, That he &s;hould be entred into
immediate Pay, as Phy&s;ician to both the

Ships, which I was &s;ure none of our Surgeons
would repine at, but rather be glad of; and
accordingly I immediately order'd him a
Cabbin, with a very good Appartment ad|joining
to it, and appointed him to eat in
my own Me&s;s whenever he pleas'd, or by
him&s;elf, on his particular Days, when he
thought fit.</P>
<P>And now it was impo&s;&s;ible to conceal from
him, that we were indeed an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship,
and that I was the Captain in Chief; except,
as has been &s;aid upon Occa&s;ion of coming to
any particular Town of <HI>Spain;</HI> I let
him know, I had a Commi&s;&s;ion to make
Prize of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and appear their
open Enemy, but that I had cho&s;en to treat
them as Friends, in a Way of Commerce, as
he had &s;een. He admir'd much the Mode|ration
I had u&s;ed, and how I had avoided
inriching my &s;elf by the Spoil, as I might
have done; and he made me many Compli|ments
upon that Head, which I excu&s;ed hear|ing,
and begg'd him to forbear: I told him,
We were Chri&s;tians, and as we had made a
very pro&s;perous Voyage, I was re&s;olved not
to do any hone&s;t Men the lea&s;t Inju&s;tice,
it I could avoid it.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here, That I did not
enter immediately into all this Confidence
with him neither, nor all at once, neither
did I let him into any Part of it, but under
the &s;ame &s;olemn Engagements of Secrecy
that he had laid upon us, nor till I was
come above Eighty Leagues South from
<HI>Lima.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="237">
The fir&s;t Thing I took the Freedom to
&s;peak to him upon, was this; Finding his Ha|bit
a little offen&s;ive to our rude Seamen, I
took him into the Cabbin, the very next
Day after we came to Sea, and told him,
That I was obliged to mention to him what I
knew he would &s;oon perceive, namely, That we
were all Prote&s;tants, except Three or Four of the
<HI>Frenchmen;</HI> and I did not know how agree|able
that might be to him: He an&s;wer'd,
That he was not at all offended with that
Part; That it was none of his Bu&s;ine&s;s to en|quire
into any one's Opinion, any farther
than they gave him Leave; That if it was
his Bu&s;ine&s;s to cure the Souls of Men on
Shore, his Bu&s;ine&s;s on Board was to cure
their Bodies; and as for the re&s;t, he would
exerci&s;e no other Function than that of a Phy|&s;ician
on board the Ship, without my Leave.</P>
<P>I told him, That was very obliging; but
that then, for his own Sake, I had a Propo&s;al
to make him, which was, Whether it would
be di&s;agreeable to him to lay a&s;ide the Habit
of a Religious, and put on that of a Gentle|man,
&s;o to accommodate him&s;elf the more
ea&s;ily to the Men on board, who, perhaps,
might be rude to him in his Habit; Seamen
being not always Men of the mo&s;t Man|ners.</P>
<P>He thank'd me very &s;incerely: He told
me, He had been in <HI>England</HI> as well as in <HI>Ire|land;</HI>
and that he went dre&s;s'd there as a Gen|tleman,
and was ready to do &s;o now, if I
thought fit, to avoid giving any Offence;
and added, that he cho&s;e to do &s;o; But then,
<PB N="27" REF="238">
&s;miling, &s;aid, He was at a great Lo&s;s, for
he had no Cloaths. I bad him take no Care
about that, for I would furni&s;h him: And
immediately we dre&s;&s;ed him up like an <HI>Eng|li&s;hman,</HI>
in a Suit of very good Cloaths,
which belong'd to one of our Mid&s;hip-men
that died. I gave him al&s;o a good Wig and
a Sword, and he pre&s;ently appear'd upon the
Quarter-Deck like a grave Phy&s;ician, and
was called <HI>Doctor.</HI></P>
<P>From that Minute, by who&s;e Contrivance
we knew not, it went current among the
Seamen, that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Doctor was an
<HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and a Prote&s;tant, and only had
put on the other Habit to di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf,
and make his E&s;cape to us: And this was &s;o
univer&s;ally believ'd, that it held to the la&s;t Day
of the whole Voyage; for as &s;oon as I met
with it, I took Care that no body that had
it in their Power would ever contradict it;
And as for the Doctor him&s;elf, he was very
glad of it and when he fir&s;t heard of it,
&s;aid, Nothing could be more to his Advan|tage,
and that he would take Care to humour
it among the Men, as far as lay in his Power.</P>
<P>However, the Doctor took Care of one
Thing, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired we would all
be mindful of it, <HI>viz.</HI> That he never offered
to go on Shore, whatever Port we came to
afterwards, and what he de&s;ired of us, was,
that none of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> might, by Enqui|ry,
hear, upon any Occa&s;ion, at his being
on board our Ship; but above all, That none
of our Men, <HI>the Officers e&s;pecially,</HI> would
ever come &s;o much in Reach of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="239">
on Shore, as to put it into their Power to
&s;eize upon them by Reprizal, and &s;o oblige
us to deliver him up by Exchange.</P>
<P>I went &s;o far with him, and &s;o did Cap|tain
<HI>Merlote</HI> al&s;o, as to a&s;&s;ure him, That if
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;hould, by any Stratagem, or
by Force, get any of our Men, nay, tho' it
was our &s;elves, into their Hands, yet he
&s;hould, upon no Conditions whatever, be deli|vered
up. And, indeed, for this very Rea|&s;on
we were very &s;hy of going on Shore at
all; and as we had really no Bu&s;ine&s;s any
where but ju&s;t for Water and fre&s;h Provi&s;ions,
which we al&s;o had taken in a very good
Store of at <HI>Lima,</HI> &s;o, for our Part, we put in
no where at all, in the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru,</HI> becau&s;e
there we might have been more particularly
liable to the Impertinencies of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
Inquiry; As to Force, we were furni&s;hed
not to be in the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ive of that.</P>
<P>Being thus, I &s;ay re&s;olved to have no more to
do with the Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru,</HI> we &s;tood off to Sea,
and the fir&s;t Land we made, was a little un|frequented
I&s;land, in the Latitude of 17 deg.
13 m. where our Men went on Shore in the
Boats three or four times to catch Tortoi&s;es, or
Turtles, being the fir&s;t we had met with &s;ince
we came from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> And here they
took &s;o many, and had &s;uch a prodigious
Quantity of Eggs out of them, that the
whole Company of both Ships liv'd on them
till within four or five Days of our coming
to the I&s;land of <HI>Juan Fernandes,</HI> which was
our next Port. Some of the&s;e Tortoi&s;es were
&s;o large and &s;o heavy, that no &s;ingle Man
<PB N="29" REF="240">
could turn them, and &s;ometimes, as much
as Four Men could carry to the Boats.</P>
<P>We met with &s;ome bad Weather after this,
which blew us off to Sea, the Wind blowing
very hard, at the <HI>South-Ea&s;t;</HI> but it was not
&s;o great a Wind as to endanger us, tho' we
lo&s;t Sight of one another more in this Storm,
than we had done in all our Voyage: How|ever,
we were none of us in any great Con|cern
for it now, becau&s;e we had agreed be|fore,
that if we &s;hould lo&s;e one another, we
&s;hould make the be&s;t of our Way to the
I&s;land of <HI>Juan Fernandes:</HI> And this we ob|&s;erv'd
now &s;o directly, that all of us &s;ha|ping
our Cour&s;e for the I&s;land, as &s;oon as the
Storm abated, came in Sight of one another
long before we came thither; which, you
may be &s;ure, was very agreeable to us all.</P>
<P>We were, including the Time of the Storm,
Two Hundred and Eighteen Days from <HI>Lima</HI>
to the I&s;land of <HI>Juan Fernandes,</HI> having mo&s;t
of the Time cro&s;s contrary Winds, and more
bad Weather than is u&s;ual in tho&s;e Seas:
However, we were all in good Condition,
both Ships and Men.</P>
<P>Here we fell to the old Trade of hunting
of Goats. And here our new Doctor &s;et &s;ome
of our Men to Simpling, that is to &s;ay, to
gather &s;ome Phy&s;ical Herbs, which he let
them &s;ee afterwards were very well worth their
while. Our Surgeons a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and &s;aw the
Plants, but had never ob&s;erv'd the &s;ame Kind
in <HI>England.</HI> They gave me the Names of
them; and 'tis the only Di&s;covery in all my
Travels which I have not re&s;erv'd &s;o carefully
<PB N="30" REF="241">
as to pubil&s;h for the Advantage of others
and which I regret the Omi&s;&s;ion of very
much.</P>
<P>While we were here, an odd Accident gave
me &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, which, however, did not
come to much: Early in the Gray of the
Morning, little Wind, and a &s;mooth Sea, a
&s;mall Frigate-built Ve&s;&s;el, under <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Co|lours,
Pennant flying, appear'd off at Sea, at
the Opening of the <HI>N. E.</HI> Point of the I&s;land; as
&s;oon as &s;he came fair with the Road, &s;he lay
by, as if &s;he came to look into the Port only,
and when &s;he perceiv'd that we began to loo&s;e
our Sails to &s;peak with her, &s;he &s;tretch'd away
to the Northward, and then altering her
Cour&s;e, &s;tood away <HI>N. E.</HI> u&s;ing Oars to a&s;&s;i&s;t
her, and &s;o got away.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more evident to us, than
that &s;he came to look at us, nor could we
imagine any thing le&s;s; from whence we im|mediately
concluded, that we were di&s;cover'd,
and that our taking away the Doctor had gi|ven
a great Alarm among the <HI>Spaniards</HI> (as
indeed we afterwards came to under&s;tand it
had done). But we came a little while after|wards
to a better Under&s;tanding about the
Frigate.</P>
<P>I was &s;o unea&s;y about it, that I re&s;olv'd
to &s;peak with her if po&s;&s;ible; &s;o I order'd
the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship, which, of the Two,
was rather a better Sailer, than our own, to
&s;tand in directly to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Chili,</HI> and
then to ply to the Northward ju&s;t in Sight of
the Shore, till he crime into the Latitude of
22; and if he &s;aw nothing in all that Run, then
<PB N="31" REF="242">
to come down again directly into the Latitude
of the I&s;land of <HI>Juan Fernandes,</HI> but keep|ing
the Di&s;tance of Ten Leagues off farther
than before, and to ply off and on in that
Latitude Five Days, and then, if he did not
meet with me, to &s;tand in for the I&s;land.</P>
<P>While he did this, I did the &s;ame at the
Di&s;tance of near Fifty Leagues from the
Shore, being the Di&s;tance which I thought
the Frigate kept in as &s;he &s;tood away from
me. We made our Crui&s;e both of us very
punctually, and I found him in the Station
we agreed on, and we both &s;tood into the
Road again from whence we came.</P>
<P>We no &s;ooner made the Road, but we &s;aw
the Frigate, as I call'd her, with another
Ship, at an Anchor in the &s;ame Road where
&s;he had &s;een us: And it was ea&s;y to &s;ee that
they were both of them in a great Surprize
and Hurry at our appearing, and that they
were under Sail in &s;o very little Time, as
that we ea&s;ily &s;aw they had &s;lipp'd their Ca|bles,
or cut away their Anchors. They
fir'd Guns twice, which we found was a Sig|nal
for their Boats, which were on Shore, to
come on board; and &s;oon after, we &s;aw
Three Boats go off to them; tho' as we un|der&s;tood
afterwards, they were obliged to
leave Sixteen or Seventeen of their Men be|hind
them, who, being among the Rocks
catching of Goats, either did not hear the
Signals, or could not come to their Boats
time enough.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="243">
When we &s;aw them in this Hurry, we
thought it mu&s;t be &s;omething extraordinary,
and bore down directly upon them, having
the Weather-Gage.</P>
<P>They were Ships of pretty good Force, and
full of Men; and when they &s;aw we were re|&s;olv'd
to &s;peak with them, and that there was
no getting away from us, they made ready
to fight us; and putting them&s;elves upon a
Wind, fir&s;t &s;tretching a Head to get the
Weather-Gage of us, when they thought they
were pretty well, boldly tack'd, and lay by
for us, hoi&s;ting the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Antient and Union-Jack.</P>
<P>We had our <HI>French</HI> Colours out till now;
but being ju&s;t, as we thought, going to engage,
I told Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> I &s;corn'd to hide what
Nation I was of when I came to fight for the
Honour of our Country; and, be&s;ides, as
the&s;e People had &s;pread <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours, I
ought to let them know what I was; that if
they were really <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and Friends, we
might not fight by Mi&s;take, and &s;hed the
innocent Blood of our own Countrymen; and
that if they were Rogues, and counterfeited
their being <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> we &s;hould &s;oon per|ceive
it.</P>
<P>However, when they &s;aw us put out <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
Colours, they knew not what to think
of it, but lay by a while to &s;ee what we
would do. I was as much puzled as they, for
as I came nearer, I thought they &s;eem'd to be
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, as well by their Bulk as by
their Way of Working; and as I came &s;till
nearer, I thought I could perceive &s;o plainly
<PB N="33" REF="244">
by my Gla&s;&s;es, that they were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sea|men,
that I made a Signal to our other Ship,
who had the Van, and was ju&s;t bearing down
upon them, to bring to; and I &s;ent my Boat
to him, to know his Opinion: He &s;ent me
Word, He did believe them to be <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and
the more (&s;aid he) becau&s;e they could be no other
Nation but <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> and the Latter
he was &s;ure they were not; but &s;ince we
were the large&s;t Ships, and that they might
as plainly &s;ee us to be <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as we could
&s;ee them, he &s;aid, he was for fighting them,
becau&s;e they ought to let us know who they
were fir&s;t: However, as I had fir'd a Gun to
bring him to, he lay by a little till we
&s;poke thus together.</P>
<P>While this was doing we could &s;ee one of their
Boats come off with Six Oars, and Two Men (a
Lieutenant and a Trumpeter it &s;eems they were)
&s;itting in the Stern, and one of them holding up a
Flag of Truce: We let them come forward, and
when they came nearer, &s;o that we could b$le em
with a Speaking-Trumpet, we ask'd em, What
Countrymen they were? and they an&s;wer'd,
<HI>Engli&s;hmen.</HI> Then we ask'd them, Whence
their Ship? Their An&s;wer was, From <HI>London.</HI>
At which we bad them come on Board, which
they did and we &s;oon found, that we were
all Countrymen and Friends, and their Boat
went immediately back to let them know it.
We found, afterwards, that they were mere
Privateers, fitted out from <HI>London</HI> al&s;o, but
coming la&s;t from <HI>Jamaica;</HI> and we let them
know no other or our &s;elves; but declin'd
keeping Company, telling them, We were
<PB N="34" REF="245">
bound now upon Traffick, and not for Pur|chace;
That we had been at the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI>
had made &s;ome Prizes, and were going back
thither again. They told us, They were come
into the South Seas for Purchace, but that
they had made little of it; having heard there
were Three large <HI>French</HI> Men of War in tho&s;e
Seas, in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Service, which made them
wi&s;h, that they had not come about; and that
they were &s;till very doubtful what to do.</P>
<P>We a&s;&s;ur'd them, We had been the Heighth of
<HI>Lima;</HI> and that we had not heard of any
Men of War, but that we had pa&s;s'd for
&s;uch our &s;elves, and perhaps were the
Ships they had heard of; for that we were
Three Sail at fir&s;t, and had &s;ometimes carry'd
<HI>French</HI> Colours.</P>
<P>This made them very glad; for it was cer|tainly
&s;o, that we had pa&s;s'd for Three
<HI>French</HI> Men of War; and they were &s;o a&s;|&s;ur'd
of it, that they went afterwards boldly
up the Coa&s;t, and made &s;everal very good Prizes,
We then found al&s;o, that it was one of the&s;e
Ships that look'd into the Road, as above,
when we were here before, and &s;eeing us then
with <HI>French</HI> Colours, took us for the Men of
War they had heard of: And they added,
That when we came in upon them again, they
gave them&s;elves up for lo&s;t Men, bur were re|&s;olv'd
to have &s;ought it out to the La&s;t, or
rather to have &s;unk by our Side, or blow them|&s;elves
up, than be taken.</P>
<P>I was not at all &s;orry that we had made this
Di&s;covery before we engag'd, for the Captains
were two brave re&s;olute Fellows, and had two
<PB N="35" REF="246">
very good Ships under them, one of Thirty|&s;ix
Guns, but able to have carry'd Forty-four
Guns; the other, which we called the
Frigate-built Ship, carry'd Twenty-eight
Guns, and they were both full of Men. Now,
tho' we &s;hould not have fear'd their Force,
yet my Ca&s;e differ'd from what it did at
fir&s;t, for we had that on Board that makes
all Men Cowards, I mean Money of which
we had &s;uch a Cargo as few <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ships
ever brought out of tho&s;e Seas; and I was
one of tho&s;e that had now no Occa&s;ion to run
needle&s;s Hazards; &s;o that, in &s;hort, I was as
well pleas'd without fighting, as they could
be: Be&s;ides, I had other Projects now in my
Head, and tho&s;e of no le&s;s Con&s;equence, than
of planting a new World, and &s;ettling
new Kingdoms to the Honour and Advantage
of my Country; and many a Time I wi&s;h'd
heartily, That all my rich Cargo was &s;afe at
<HI>London;</HI> That my Merchants were &s;haring
the Silver, and the Gold, and the Pearl
among them&s;elves, and, That I was but &s;afe
on Shore, with a Thou&s;and good Families, up|on
the South of <HI>Chili,</HI> and about Fifteen Hun|dred
good Soldiers, and Arms for Ten Thou|&s;and
more (of which by-and-by) and with the
Two Ships I had now with me, I would not
apprehend all the Power of the Spaniards,
I mean, that they could bring again&s;t me in the
<HI>South-Seas.</HI></P>
<P>I had all the&s;e Things, I &s;ay in my Head al|ready,
tho' nothing like to what I had after|wards,
when I &s;aw farther into the Matter my|&s;elf;
However, the&s;e Things made me very glad,
<PB N="36" REF="247">
that I had no Occa&s;ion to engage tho&s;e
Ships.</P>
<P>When we came thus to under&s;tand one ano|ther,
we went all into the Road together, and
I invited the Captains of the Two Privateers
on board me, where I treated them with the
be&s;t I had; tho' I had no great Dainties now,
having been &s;o long out of <HI>England.</HI> They
invited me, and Captain <HI>Merlote,</HI> and the
Captain of the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship, in Return,
and indeed treated us very nobly.</P>
<P>After this, we exchang'd &s;ome Pre&s;ents of
Refre&s;hments, and, particularly, they &s;ent me
a Hog&s;head of Rum, which was very accept|able;
and I &s;ent them, in Return, a Runlet
of Arrack, excu&s;ing my&s;elf, that I had no
great Store. I &s;ent them al&s;o the Quantity
of One Hundred Weight of Nutmegs and
Cloves; but the mo&s;t agreeable Pre&s;ent I &s;ent
them, was, Twenty Pieces of my <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI>
Dryed Beef, cur'd in the Sun, the like of
which they had never &s;een or ta&s;ted before;
and, without Que&s;tion, 'tis &s;uch an excellent
Way of curing Beef, that if I were to be at
<HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> again, I would take in a &s;ufficient
Quantity of Beef &s;o pre&s;erv'd, to victual the
whole Ship for the Voyage; and I leave it
as a Direction to all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seamen that have
Occa&s;ion to u&s;e <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Voyages.</P>
<P>I bought afterwards Six Hog&s;heads of Rum
of the&s;e Privateers, for I found they were
very well &s;tor'd with Liquors, whatever el&s;e
they wanted.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd hero Twelve or Fourteen Days,
but took Care, by Agreement, that our Men
<PB N="37" REF="248">
&s;hould never go on Shore the &s;ame Days
that their Men went on Shore, or theirs
when ours went; as well to avoid their Caball|ing
together, as to avoid Quarreling; tho'
the latter was the Pretence. We agreed al&s;o,
not to receive on Board any of our Ships
respectively any of the Crews belonging to
the other: And this was their Advantage,
for if we would have given Way to that, half
their Men, would, for ought I know, have
come over to us.</P>
<P>While we lay here, one of them went a
cruizing, finding the Wind fair to run in for
the Shore, and in about Five Days &s;he came
back with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prize, laden with
Meal, Cocoa, and a large Quantity of Bi&s;|cuit,
ready bak'd; She was bound to
<HI>Lima,</HI> from <HI>Baldivia,</HI> or &s;ome Port nearer;
I do not remember, exactly, which: They
had &s;ome Gold on Board, but not much, and
had bought their Lading at St. <HI>Jago.</HI> As
&s;oon as we &s;aw them coming in with a Prize
in Tow, we put out our <HI>French</HI> Colours,
and gave Notice to the Privateers, that it
was for their Advantage that we did &s;o; and
&s;o indeed it was, for it would pre&s;ently have
alarmed all the Country, if &s;uch a Fleet of
Privateers had appear'd on the Coa&s;t. We
Prevail'd with them to give us their <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Pri&s;oners, and to allow us to &s;et them on
Shore; I having a&s;&s;ur'd them, I would not
land them till I came to <HI>Baldivia,</HI> nor &s;uffer
them to have the lea&s;t Corre&s;pondence
with any Body till they came thither; the
Spaniards al&s;o giving their Parole of
<PB N="38" REF="249">
Honour, not to give any Account of their
being taken, till Fourteen Days after they
were on Shore.</P>
<P>This being the farthe&s;t Port <HI>South</HI> which
the &s;aid <HI>Spaniards</HI> are Ma&s;ters of in <HI>Chili,</HI> or in|deed
on the whole Continent of <HI>America,</HI> they
could not de&s;ire me to carry them any far|ther:
They allow'd us a Quantity of Meal
and Cocoa out of their Booty, for the Sub|&s;i&s;tance
of the Pri&s;oners; and I bought a
larger Quantity more of it, there being
more than they knew how to &s;tow; and they
did not re&s;olve to keep the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship
which they took; By this Means, I was
doubly &s;tock'd with Flower and Bread; but
as the fir&s;t was very good, and well pack'd
in Cask, and very good Jars, it was no
Burthen.</P>
<P>We bought al&s;o &s;ome of their Cocoa, and
made Chocolate till our Men gorg'd them|&s;elves
with it, and would eat no more.</P>
<P>Having furni&s;h'd our &s;elves here with
Goats Fle&s;h, as u&s;ual, and taken in Water
&s;ufficient, we left <HI>Juan Fernandes,</HI> and &s;aw the
Crui&s;ers go out the &s;ame Tide, they &s;teering
<HI>N. N. E.</HI> and we <HI>S. S. E.</HI> They &s;aluted us
at parting, and we bad them Good-bye in the
&s;ame Language.</P>
<P>While we were now &s;ailing for the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Chili,</HI> with fair Wind and plea&s;ant Wea|ther,
ther, my <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Doctor came to me, and
told me, he had a Piece of News to acquaint
me with, which, he &s;aid, he believ'd would
plea&s;e me very well; and this was, That
one of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners was a Planter,
<PB N="39" REF="250">
as 'tis call'd in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> or a Farmer as
we &s;hould call it in <HI>England,</HI> of <HI>Villa-Rica,</HI> a
Town built by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> near the Foot of
the <HI>Andes,</HI> above the Town of <HI>Baldivia;</HI> and
that he had entred into Di&s;cour&s;e with him upon
the Situation of tho&s;e Hills, the Nature of
the Surface, the Rivers, Hollows, Pa&s;&s;ages,
into them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whether there were any Valleys
within the Hills, of what Extent, how wa|tred,
what Cattle, what People, how di&s;po&s;ed,
and the like and, in &s;hort, if there was any
pa&s;&s;ing over them: and he told me, in few
Words, That he found him to be a very hone&s;t,
frank, open &s;ort of a Per&s;on, who &s;eem'd to
&s;peak without Re&s;erve, without the lea&s;t
Jealou&s;y or Apprehen&s;ion; and that, in a
Word, he believ'd, I might have an ample
Di&s;covery from him of all that I de&s;ir'd to
know.</P>
<P>I was very glad of tins News, you may be
&s;ure; and it was not many Hours before I
made him bring the <HI>Spaniard</HI> into the great
Cabbin to me, where I treated him very
civilly, and gave him Opportunity &s;everal
Times, to &s;ee him&s;elf very well u&s;ed; and
indeed all the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Ship were
very thankful, for my bringing them out
of the Hands of the Privateers, and took
all Occa&s;ions to let us &s;ee it.</P>
<P>I &s;aid little the fir&s;t Time, but di&s;cours'd in
general of <HI>America,</HI> of the Greatne&s;s and Opu|lency
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> there; the in&s;inite Wealth
of the Country, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and I remember well, di&s;|cour&s;ing
once of the great Riches of the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America</HI> the Silver Mines of
<PB N="40" REF="251">
<HI>Poto&s;i,</HI> and other Places, he turn'd &s;hor
upon me, &s;miling, and &s;aid, We <HI>Spaniard</HI>
are the wor&s;t Nation in the World
that &s;uch a Trea&s;ure as this could have belong'd
to; for if it had fallen into any other Hands
than ours, &s;ays he, they would have &s;earch'd
farther into it before now. I a&s;k'd him, What
he meant by that? I &s;aid, I thought they had
&s;earch'd it thoroughly enough; for that I
believ'd no Nation in the World could ever
have &s;pread &s;uch va&s;t Dominions, and planted
a Country of &s;uch a prodigious Extent, and
have not only kept the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, but
have maintain'd the Government al&s;o, and
even inhabited it, with &s;o few People.</P>
<P>Perhaps, Seignior, &s;ays he, you think, not|with&s;tanding
that Opinion of yours, that we
have many more People of our Nation in
New-Spain than we have. I do not know,
&s;aid I, how many you may have; but if I
&s;hould believe, you have as many here as in
<HI>Old-Spain,</HI> it would be but a few in Compari|&s;on
of the infinite Extent of the King of
<HI>Spain</HI>'s Dominions in <HI>America;</HI> And then, add|ed
he, I a&s;&s;ure you, Seignior, there is not
one <HI>Spaniard</HI> to a Thou&s;and Acres of Land,
take one Place with another throughout <HI>New-Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Very well, &s;aid I, then I think the Riches
and Wealth of <HI>America</HI> is very well &s;earched,
in Compari&s;on to the Number of People you
have to &s;earch after it: No, &s;ays he, it is not
neither; for the greate&s;t Number of our People
live in that Part where the Wealth is not
greate&s;t; and where even the Governor and
<PB N="41" REF="252">
Viceroy, enjoying a plentiful and luxurious
Life, they take no Thought for the Encrea&s;e, ei|ther
of the King's Revenues, or the National
Wealth: This he &s;poke of the City of <HI>Mexico,</HI>
who&s;e Greatne&s;s, and the Number of its Inha|bitants,
he &s;aid, was a Di&s;ea&s;e to the re&s;t of
the Body: And what think you, Seignior, &s;aid he,
that in that one City, where is neither Silver
or Gold but what is brought from the Moun|tains
of St. <HI>Clara,</HI> the Mines at St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI>'s
and our <HI>Lady,</HI> &s;ome of which are an Hundred
Leagues from it, and yet there are more <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
in <HI>Mexico</HI> than in both the&s;e two prodi|gious
Empires of <HI>Chili</HI> and <HI>Peru?</HI></P>
<P>I &s;eem'd not to believe him; and indeed I
did not believe him at fir&s;t, till he return'd to
me with a Que&s;tion, Pray, Seignior Capitain,
&s;ays he, how many <HI>Spaniards</HI> do you think
there may be in this va&s;t Country of <HI>Chili?</HI>
I told him, I could make no gue&s;s of the Num|bers
but, without Que&s;tion, there were many
Thou&s;ands; intimating, that I might &s;uppo&s;e
near an Hundred Thou&s;and: At which he
laugh'd heartily, and a&s;&s;ur'd me, That there
were not above Two Thou&s;and Five Hundred
in the whole Kingdom, be&s;ides Women and
Children, and &s;ome few Soldiers, which they
looked upon as nothing to Inhabitants, becau&s;e
they were not &s;ettled any where.</P>
<P>I was indeed &s;urpriz'd, and began to name
&s;ome large Places, which I thought had &s;ingly
more <HI>Spaniards</HI> in them than what he talk'd of.
He pre&s;ently ran over &s;ome of them; and
naming <HI>Baldivia</HI> fir&s;t, as the mo&s;t <HI>Southward,</HI>
he a&s;k'd me, How many I thought were there?
<PB N="42" REF="253">
And I told him, About Three Hundred Fa|milies:
He &s;mil'd at me, and a&s;&s;ur'd me,
there were not above Three or Four and Fifty
Families in the whole Place, and about
Twenty-five Soldiers; altho' it was a Forti|fication,
and a Frontier. (At <HI>Villa Rica,</HI> or the
Rich Town) where he liv'd, he &s;aid, There
might be about Sixty Families, and a Lieu|tenant
with Twenty Soldiers. In a Word, we
pa&s;s'd over the many Places between, and
came to the Capital St. <HI>Jago,</HI> where after I
had &s;uppo&s;ed there were Five Thou&s;and
<HI>Spaniards;</HI> he prote&s;ted to me, there were not
above Eight Hundred, including the Viceroy's
Court, and including the Families at <HI>Valpa|ri&s;o,</HI>
which is the Sea-Port, and excluding
only the Soldiers, which, as he &s;aid, being the
Capital of the whole Kingdom, might be
about Two Hundred, and excluding the Religious,
who, he added, laughing, &s;ignify'd no|thing
to the planting a Country, for they
neither cultivated the Land, nor increa&s;ed
the People.</P>
<P>Our Doctor, who was our Interpreter,
&s;mil'd at this, but merrily &s;aid, That was very,
true, or ought to be &s;o; intimating, that tho'
the Prie&s;ts do not cultivate the Land, yet
they might chance to increa&s;e the People a
little; but that was by the Way. As to the
Number of Inhabitants at Sr. <HI>Jago,</HI> the
Dodtor agreed with him, and &s;aid, he believ'd
he had &s;aid more than there was, rather than
le&s;s.</P>
<P>As then to the Kingdom or Empire of <HI>Peru,</HI>
in which there are many con&s;iderable Cities
<PB N="43" REF="254">
and Places of Note, &s;uch as <HI>Lima, Quitto,
Cu&s;co la Plata,</HI> and others; be&s;ides the great
Number of Towns on the Sea-Coa&s;ts, &s;uch
as Port <HI>Arica,</HI> St. <HI>Miguel, Payta, Guyaquil,
Truxillo,</HI> and many others.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, That it was true, that the
City of Lima, with the Town of <HI>Callao,</HI> was
much increa&s;ed within a few Years; and,
particularly, of late, by the &s;ettling of between
Three and Four Hundred <HI>French</HI> there, who
came by the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Licen&s;e; but that
before the coming of tho&s;e Gentlemen, at
which he &s;hook his Head, the Country was
richer, tho' the Inhabitants were not &s;o many;
and that, take it as it was now, there could
not be reckoned above Fifteen Hundred Fa|milies
of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> excluding the Soldiers,
and the Clergy, which, as above, he reckoned
nothing as to the planting the Country.</P>
<P>We came then to di&s;cour&s;e of the Silver-Mines
at <HI>Poto&s;i,</HI> and here he &s;uppo&s;ed, as I
did al&s;o, a very great Number of People; But,
Seignior, &s;ays he, What People is it you are
&s;peaking of? There are many Thou&s;ands of
Servants, but few Ma&s;ters; there is a Gari&s;on
of Four Hundred Soldiers, always kept in
Arms, and in good Order, to &s;ecure the Place,
and keep the Negroes and Criminals, who
work in the Mines, in Subjection but,
that there were not be&s;ides Five Hun|dred
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> that is to &s;ay Men, in the
whole Place and its Adjacents. So that, in
&s;hort, he would not allow above Seven Thou&s;and
<HI>Spaniards</HI> in the whole Empire of <HI>Peru,</HI> and
Two Tuou&s;and Five Hundred in <HI>Chili;</HI> at the
<PB N="44" REF="255">
&s;ame Time allowing Twice as many as both
the&s;e in the City of <HI>Mexico</HI> only.</P>
<P>After this Di&s;cour&s;e was over, I ask'd him,
What he inferr'd from it, as to the Wealth of
the Country not being di&s;cover'd? He an|&s;wer'd,
It was evident that it was for want
of People that the Wealth of the Country lay
hid; That there was infinitely more lay un|enquir'd
after, than had yet been known; That
there were &s;everal Mountains in <HI>Peru</HI> equally
rich in Silver with that of <HI>Poto&s;i;</HI> And as
for <HI>Chili,</HI> &s;ays he, and the Country where we
live, there is more Gold at this Time in the
Mountains of the <HI>Andes,</HI> and more ea&s;y to
come at, than in all the World be&s;ides: Nay,
&s;ays he, with &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion, there is more
Gold every Year wa&s;h'd down out of the
<HI>Andes</HI> of <HI>Chili</HI> into the Sea, and lo&s;t there,
than all the Riches that go from <HI>New Spain</HI>
to <HI>Europe</HI> in Twenty Years, amount to.</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e fir'd my Imagination, you
may he &s;ure, and I renewed it upon all Occa|sions,
taking more or le&s;s Time, every Day,
to talk with this <HI>Spaniard</HI> upon the <HI>Sub|ject</HI>
of Cultivation of the Lands, Improve|ment
of the Country, and the like; always
making &s;uch Enquiries into the State of the
Mountains of the <HI>Andes,</HI> as be&s;t &s;uited my
Purpo&s;e, but yet &s;o as not to give him the
lea&s;t Intimation of my De&s;ign.</P>
<P>One Day, conver&s;ing with him again about
the great Riches of the Country, and of the
Mountains and Rivers, as above, I a&s;ked
him, That &s;eeing the Place was &s;o rich, why
<PB N="45" REF="256">
were they not all Princes, or as rich as Princes,
that dwelt there?</P>
<P>He &s;hook his Head, and &s;aid, It was a
great Reproach upon them many Ways; and
when I pre&s;s'd him to explain him&s;elf, he
an&s;wered, It was occa&s;ioned by Two Things;
namely, Pride and Sloth. <HI>Seignior,</HI> &s;ays he,
we have &s;o much Pride, that we have no
Avarice, and we do not covet enough to make
us work for it: We walk about &s;ometimes,
&s;ays he, on the Banks of the Streams that
come down from the Mountains, and if we
&s;ee a bit of Gold lie on the Shore, it may be
we will vouch&s;afe to lay off our Cloak and
&s;tep forward to take it up; but if we were
&s;ure to carry home as much as we could &s;tand
under, we would not &s;trip and go to work
in the Water to wa&s;h it out of the Sand; or
take the Pains to get it together; nor, per|haps,
di&s;honour our&s;elves &s;o much as to be
&s;een carrying a Load, no, not for all the
Value of the Gold it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I laugh'd then, indeed; and told him, He
was di&s;po&s;ed to je&s;t with his Countrymen, or
to &s;peak Ironically meaning, That they did
not take &s;o much Pains as was required, to
make them effectually rich but that, I &s;up|po&s;ed,
he would not have me uuder&s;tand
him as he &s;poke: He &s;aid, I might under|&s;tand
as favourable as I plea&s;ed, but I &s;hould
and the Fact to be true, if I would go up
with him to <HI>Villa Rica,</HI> when I came to <HI>Baldi|via;</HI>
and with that, he made his Compliment
to me, and invited me to his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="257">
I a&s;ked him, with a <HI>Con Licentia, Seignior,</HI>
that is, With Pardon for &s;o much Freedom,
That if he lived in &s;o rich a Country, and
where there was &s;o inexhau&s;tible a Trea&s;ure
of Gold, how he came to fall into this State of
Captivity? and what made him venture him|&s;elf
upon the Sea to fall into the Hands of
Pyrates?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, That it was on the very Foot
of what he had been complaining of; and
that having &s;een &s;o much of the Wealth of
the Country he lived in, and having reproach|ed
him&s;elf with that very Indolence which
he now blamed all his Country-men for, he
had re&s;olved, in Conjunction with Two of his
Neighbours the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and Men of good
Sub&s;tance, to &s;et to work in a Place in the
Mountains where they had found &s;ome Gold,
and had &s;een much wa&s;h'd down by the
Water, and to find what might be done in
a thorough Search after the Fund or Mine of
it, which they were &s;ure was not far of; and
that he was going to <HI>Lima,</HI> and from thence, if
he could not be &s;upplied, to <HI>Panama,</HI> to buy
Negroes for the Work, that they might carry
it on with the better Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>This was a feeling Di&s;cour&s;e to me, and
made &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion on me, that I &s;ecret|ly
re&s;olved, That when I came to <HI>Baldivia,</HI>
I would go up with this &s;incere <HI>Spaniard</HI> (for
&s;o I thought him to be, and &s;o I found him)
and would be an Eye-Witne&s;s to the Di&s;cove|ry,
which, I thought, was made to my
Hand, and which I found now, I could make
<PB N="47" REF="258">
more effectual than by all the Attempts I was
like to make by Second Hand.</P>
<P>From this Time I treated the <HI>Spaniard</HI> with
more than ordinary Courte&s;y, and told him,
It I was not Captain of a great Ship, and
had a Cargo upon me of other Gentlemens
E&s;tates, he had &s;aid &s;o much of tho&s;e Things,
that I &s;hould be tempted to give him a Vi&s;it,
as he had de&s;ired, and &s;ee tho&s;e mon&s;trous
Mountains of the <HI>Andes.</HI></P>
<P>He told me, That if I would do him &s;o
much Honour, I &s;hould not be obliged to any
long Stay that he would procure Mules for
me at <HI>Baldivia,</HI> and that I &s;hould go, not to
his Hou&s;e only, but to the Mountain it&s;elf,
and &s;ee all that I de&s;ired, and be back again
in Fourteen Days at the farthe&s;t. I &s;hook
my Head, as if it could not be, but he never
le&s;t importuning me; and once or twice,
as if I had been afraid to venture my&s;elf with
him, he told me, He would &s;end for his Two
Sons, and leave them in the Ship as Ho&s;tages
for my Safety.</P>
<P>I was fully &s;atisfied as to that Point, but
did not let him know my Mind yet; but
every Day we dwelt upon the &s;ame Subject,
and I travelled through the Mountains and
Valleys To duely, in every Day's Di&s;cour&s;e,
with him, that when I afterwards can$e to
the Places we had talk'd of, it was as if I
had look'd over them in a Map before.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him, If the <HI>Andes</HI> were a more
Wall of Mountains, contiguous and without
Intervals and Spaces like a Forti&s;ication or
Boundary to a Country? Or, Whether they
<PB N="48" REF="259">
lay promi&s;cuous and di&s;tant from one ano|ther?
And, Whether there lay any Way over
them into the Country beyond them.</P>
<P>He &s;mil'd when I talk'd of going over them:
He told me, They were &s;o infinitely high, that
no human Creature could live upon the Top;
and withal &s;o &s;teep, and &s;o frightful, that if
there was even a Pair of Stairs up on one Side,
and down on the other, no Man alive would
dare to mount up, or venture down.</P>
<P>But that, as for the Notion of the Hills
being contiguous, like a Wall that had no
Gates, that was all fabulous; that there were
&s;everal fair Entrances in among the Moun|tains,
and large, plea&s;ant, and fruitful Val|leys
among the Hills, with plea&s;ant Rivers
and Numbers of Inhabitants, and Cattle and
Provi&s;ions of all Sorts; and that &s;ome of the
mo&s;t delightful Places to live in, that were in
the whole World, were among tho&s;e Valleys,
in the very Center of the Highe&s;t and mo&s;t
Dreadful Mountains.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid I, <HI>Seignior,</HI> but how do they go
out of one Valley into another? And whither
do they go at la&s;t? He an&s;wered me, Tho&s;e
Valleys are always full of plea&s;ant Rivers
and Brooks, which fall from the Hills, and
are form'd generally into one principal Stream
to every Vale; and that as the&s;e mu&s;t have
their Outlets on one Side of the Hills, or on
the other, &s;o, following the Cour&s;e of tho&s;e
Streams, one is always &s;ure to find the Way
out of one Valley into another, and at la&s;t,
out of the whole into the open Country; &s;o
that it was very frequent to pa&s;s from one
<PB N="49" REF="260">
Side to the other of the whole Body of the
Mountains, and not go much higher up Hill,
or down Hill, compared to the Mills in other
Places. It was true, he &s;aid, There was no
abrupt vi&s;ible Parting in the Mountains,
that &s;hould &s;eem like a Way cut through
from the Bottom to the Top, which would
be, indeed, frightful, but that as they pa&s;s
from &s;ome of the Valleys to others, there are
A&s;cents and De&s;cents, Windings and Turn|ings,
Sloaping up, and Sloaping down, where
we may &s;tand on tho&s;e little Ridges, and &s;ee
the Waters on one Side run to the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and
on the other Side, to the <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I as&s;ked him, What kind of a Country
was on the other Side? and how long Time
It would take up to go through from one Side
to the other? He told me, There were Ways,
indeed, that were more mountainous and un|ea&s;y,
in which Men kept upon the Sides or
Declivity of the Hills; in which the Natives
would go, and guide others to go, and
&s;o might pa&s;s the whole Ridge of the <HI>Andes</HI>
in Eight or Nine Days; but that tho&s;e Ways
were e&s;teemed very di&s;mal, lonely and
dangerous, becau&s;e of wild Bea&s;ts; but that
through the Valleys, the Way was ea&s;y and
plea&s;ant, and perfectly &s;afe, only farther
about and that tho&s;e Ways a Man might
be Sixteen or Seventeen Days going through.</P>
<P>I laid up all this in my Heart, to make
u&s;e of as I &s;hould have Occa&s;ion; but I ac|knowledge,
That it was &s;urprizing to me,
as it was &s;o perfectly agreeing with the No|tion
that I always entertained of tho&s;e Moun|tains,
<PB N="50" REF="261">
of the Riches of them, the Facility
of Acce&s;s to and from them, and the ea&s;y
Pa&s;&s;age from one Side to another.</P>
<P>The next Di&s;cour&s;e I had with him upon
this Subject, I began thus; Well, <HI>Seignior,</HI>
&s;aid I, We are now come quite through the
Valleys and Pa&s;&s;ages of the <HI>Andes,</HI> and, me|thinks,
I &s;ee a va&s;t open Country before me
on the other Side; pray tell me, Have you
ever been &s;o far as to look into that Part of
the World, and what kind of a Country
is it.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered gravely, That he had been
far enough &s;everal Times, to look at a Di|&s;tance
into the va&s;t Country I &s;pake of; And
&s;uch indeed it is, &s;aid he; and as we come
upon the ri&s;ing Part of the Hills, we &s;ee a
great way, and a Country without End; but
as to any De&s;criptions of it, I can &s;ay but
little, added he, only this, That it is a very
fruitful Country on that Side next the Hills:
What it is farther, I know not.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him, If there were any con&s;idera|ble
Rivers in it? and which Way they gene|rally
run? He &s;aid, It could not be, but that
from &s;uch a Ridge of Mountains as the <HI>Andes,</HI>
there mu&s;t be a great many Rivers on that
Side, as there were apparently on this; and
that, as the Country was infinitely larger,
and their Cour&s;e, in proportion, longer, it
would nece&s;&s;arily follow, That tho&s;e &s;mall
Rivers would run one into another, and &s;o
form great Navigable Rivers, as was the
Ca&s;e in the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> which originally
&s;prung from the &s;ame Hills, about the City
<PB N="51" REF="262">
<HI>La Plata</HI> In <HI>Peru,</HI> and &s;wallowing up all
the Streams of le&s;s Note, became, by the
meer Length of its Cour&s;e, one of the greate&s;t
Rivers in the World: That, as he ob&s;erved,
mo&s;t of tho&s;e Rivers ran rather <HI>South-Ea&s;t|ward</HI>
than <HI>Northward,</HI> he believed they ran
away to the Sea, a great way farther to the
<HI>South,</HI> than the <HI>Rio de la Plata;</HI> but as to
what Part of the Coa&s;t they might come to
the Sea in, that he knew nothing of.</P>
<P>This Account was &s;o rational, that nothing
could be more; and was, indeed, extremely
&s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o very remarkable, That this
agreed exactly with the Accounts before
given me by the Two <HI>Chilian Indians,</HI> or <HI>Na|tives,</HI>
which I had on Board, and with whom
I &s;till continued to di&s;cour&s;e as Occasion pre|&s;ented;
but who, at this Time, I removed
into the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship, to make Room for,
the&s;e <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was made very
&s;en&s;ible by my Doctor of the Obligation both
he and his Fellow-Pri&s;oners were Under to me,
in my per&s;uading the Privateers to &s;et them
at Liberty, and in undertaking to carry them
home to that Part of <HI>Spain</HI> from whence they
came; for as they had lo&s;t their Cargo, their
Voyage &s;eemed to be at an End; The Sen&s;e
of the Favour, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> which I had done him,
and was &s;till doing him, in the civil Treat|ment
which I gave him, made this Gentle|man
for &s;uch he was in him&s;elf, and in his
Di&s;po&s;ition, whatever he was by Family, for
that I knew nothing of; I &s;ay, it made him
<PB N="52" REF="263">
exceeding importunate with me, and with
my Doctor, who &s;poke <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> perfectly well
to go with him to <HI>Villa Rica.</HI></P>
<P>I made him no Promi&s;e, but talked at a
Di&s;tance; I told him, If he had lived by the
Sea$ and I could have &s;ailed to his Door, it
my Ship, I would have made him a Vi&s;it
He returned, That he wi&s;hed he could mak$
the River of <HI>Baldivia</HI> Navigable for me, tha$
I might bring my Ship up to his Door, and
he would venture to &s;ay, That neither me
nor all my Ship's Company, &s;hould &s;tarv$
while we were with him. In the Interva
of the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, I a&s;ked my Doctor hi$
Opinion, Whether he thought I might tru&s;$
this <HI>Spaniard,</HI> if I had a Mind to go up and
&s;ee the Country for a few Days?</P>
<P><HI>Seignior,</HI> &s;ays he, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are, i$
&s;ome Re&s;pects, the wor&s;t Nation under th$
Sun; They are cruel, inexorable, uncharitable
voracious, and, in &s;everal Ca&s;es, treacherous
but in Two Things, they are to be depended
upon beyond all the Nations in the World
that is to &s;ay, When they give their Honou$
to perform any thing; and when they hav$
a Return to make for any Favour received
and here he entertained me with a long Stor$
of a Merchant of <HI>Chartagena,</HI> who, in a Sloop
was Shipwreck'd at Sea, and was taken u$
by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant, on Board a Shi$
bound to <HI>London</HI> from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> or &s;ome
other of our I&s;lands; That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mer|chant,
meeting another <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship boun$d
to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> put the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchant o$
Board him, paid him for his Pa&s;&s;age, and
<PB N="53" REF="264">
obliged him to &s;et him on Shore on the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
Coa&s;t, as near to <HI>Chartogena</HI> as he could.
This <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchant could never re&s;t 'till
he found Means to Ship him&s;elf from <HI>Charta|gena</HI>
to the <HI>Havana,</HI> on the <HI>Galleons;</HI> from
thence to <HI>Cadiz</HI> in <HI>Old-Spain;</HI> and from thence
to <HI>London,</HI> to find out the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant,
and make him a Pre&s;ent to the Value of a
Thou&s;and Pi&s;toles, for &s;aving his Life, and
for his civil returning him to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> &amp;c.
Whether the Story was true or not, his Infer|ence
from it, was ju&s;t; namely, That a <HI>Spa|niard</HI>
never forgot a Kindne&s;s; But take it
withal, &s;ays the Doctor, that I believe 'tis
as much the Effect of their Pride, as of their
Virtue; for at the &s;ame Time, &s;aid he, they
never forget an ill Turn, any more than they
do a good one; and they frequently intail their
Enmities on their Families, and pro&s;ecute the
Revenge from one Generation to another; &s;o
that the Heir has, with the E&s;tate of his An|ce&s;tors,
all the Family Broils upon his Hands
as he comes to his E&s;tate.</P>
<P>From all this he inferred, That as this <HI>Spa|niard</HI>
found him&s;elf &s;o very much obliged to
me, I might depend upon it, that he had &s;o
much Pride in him, that if he could pull
down the <HI>Andes</HI> for me to go through, and
I wanted it, he would do it for me; and that
nothing would be a greater Satisfaction to
him, than to find &s;ome way or other how to
requite me.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es &s;hortned our Voyage,
and we arrived fair and &s;oftly (for it was
very good Weather, and little Wind) at <HI>Tuca|pel,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="265">
or the River <HI>Imperial,</HI> within Ten Leagues
of <HI>Baldivia,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Of <HI>Cape Boni&s;acio,</HI>
which is the <HI>North</HI> Point of the Entrance into
the River of <HI>Baldivia;</HI> and here I took one
of the mo&s;t unaccountable, and, I mu&s;t needs
acknowledge, unju&s;tifiable Re&s;olutions, that
ever any Commander, intru&s;ted with a
Ship of &s;uch Force, and a Cargo of &s;uch
Con&s;equence, adventured upon before; and
which I, by no means, recommend to any
Commander of a Ship to imitate; and this
was, To venture up into the Country above
One hundred and Fifty Miles from my Ship,
leaving the Succe&s;s of the whole Voyage, the
E&s;tates of my Employers, and the riche&s;t
Ship and Cargo, that ever came out of tho&s;e
Seas, to the Care and Fidelity of Two or
Three Men. Such was the un&s;atisfied Thir&s;t
of New Di&s;coveries, which I brought out of
<HI>England</HI> with me, and which I nouri&s;h'd at
all Hazards, to the End of the Voyage.</P>
<P>However, though I condemn my&s;elf, in
the main, for the Ra&s;hne&s;s of the Undertak|ing,
yet let me do my&s;elf &s;o much Ju&s;tice,
as to leave it on Record too, That I did not
run this Ri&s;que without all the needful
Precautions for the Safety of the Ship and
Cargo.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, I found out a &s;afe Place for the
Ships to ride; and this, neither in the River
of <HI>Tucapel,</HI> nor in the River of <HI>Baldivia,</HI> but
in an Opening or Inlet of Water without a
Name, about a League to the <HI>South</HI> of <HI>Tuca|pel,</HI>
embayed and &s;ecured from almo&s;t all
the Winds that could blow: Here the Ships
<PB N="55" REF="266">
lay ea&s;y, with Water enough, having about
Eleven, Fathoms good holding Ground, and
about half a League from Shore.</P>
<P>I left the <HI>Supra-Cargo,</HI> and my chief Mate,
al&s;o a Kin&s;man of my own, a true Sailor, who
had been a Mid&s;hip-man, but was now a
Lieutenant: I &s;ay, To tho&s;e I left the Com|mand
of both my Ships, but with expre&s;s
Orders not to &s;tir, nor unmoo$r, upon any Ac|count
whatever, Life and Death excepted,
'till my Return; or 'till, if I was dead, they
heard what was become of me; no, though
they were to &s;tay there Six Months, for they
had Provi&s;ions enough, and an excellent Place
for watering lay ju&s;t by them; and I made
all the Men &s;wear to me, that they would
make no Mutiny or Di&s;order, but obey my
&s;aid Kin&s;man in one Ship, and the <HI>Supra-Cargo</HI>
in the other, in all Things, except re|moving
from that Place; and that if they
&s;hould command them to &s;tir from thence,
they would not &s;o much as touch a Sail or a
Rope.</P>
<P>When I had made all the&s;e Conditions,
and told my Men, That the De&s;ign I went
upon, was for the Good of their Voyage, for the
Service of the Owners, and &s;hould, if it &s;uc|ceeded,
be for all their Advantages; I a&s;ked
them, If they were all willing I &s;hould go?
to which they all an&s;wered, That they were
very willing, and would take the &s;ame Care
of the Ships, and of all Things belonging to
them, as if I were on Board. This encou|raged
me greatly, and I now re&s;olved nothing
&s;hould hinder me.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="267">
Having thus concluded every thing, then
and not 'till then, I told my <HI>Spaniard,</HI> Tha$
I had almo&s;t re&s;olved to go along with him;
at which he appeared exceedingly plea&s;ed,
and, indeed, in a Surprize of Joy. I &s;hould
have told you, That before I told him this,
I had &s;et all the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners on Shore,
at their own Reque&s;t, ju&s;t between the Port
of <HI>Tucapel,</HI> and the Bay of the <HI>Conception,</HI>
except Two Men, who, as he told me, liv'd
in the Open Country beyond <HI>Baldivia,</HI> and, as
he ob&s;erved, were very glad to be &s;et on Shore
with him, &s;o to travel home, having lo&s;t what
little they had in the Ship, and to whom he
communicated nothing of all the Di&s;cour&s;e we
had had of the Affair of the Mountains.</P>
<P>I al&s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed now the Two <HI>Chilian Indi|an,</HI>
but not without a very good Reward,
proportioned to, not their Trouble and Time
only, but proportioned to what I &s;eemed to
expect of them, and filling them &s;till with
Expectations, that I would come again, and
take a Journey with them into the Moun|tains.</P>
<P>And now it became nece&s;&s;ary, that I &s;hould
u&s;e the utmo&s;t Freedom with my new Friend
the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> being, as I told him, to put
my Life in his Hands, and the Pro&s;perity of
my whole Adventure, both Ship and Ship's
Company.</P>
<P>He told me, He was &s;en&s;ible that I did
put my Life in his Hands, and that it was
a very great Token of Confidence in him,
even &s;uch a one, that he, being a Stranger to
me, had no Rea&s;on to expect; but he de|&s;ired
<PB N="57" REF="268">
me to con&s;ider, that he was a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI>
not a <HI>Savage;</HI> That he was one, I had laid
the highe&s;t Obligation upon, in voluntarily
taking him out of the Hands of the Free|booters,
where he might have lo&s;t his Life;
And, in the next Place, he &s;aid, It was &s;ome
Argument, that he was a Gentleman, and
that I &s;hould find him to be a Man of Ho|nour;
and, la&s;tly, That it did not appear,
that he could make any Advantage of me,
or that he could get any thing by u&s;ing me
ill; and if even that was no Argument, yet I
&s;hould find, when I came to his Hou&s;e, that
he was not in a Condition to want any
thing, that might be gained, &s;o much as to
procure it by &s;uch a Piece of Villainy and Trea|chery,
as to betray and de&s;troy the Man that
had &s;av'd his Life, and brought him out of
the Hands of the Devil, &s;afe to his Country
and Family, when he might have been car|ried
away, God knows whither. But, to con|clude
all, He de&s;ired me to accept the Offer
he had made me at Sea (<HI>viz.</HI>) That he would
&s;end for his Two Sons, and leave them on
Board the Ship as Ho&s;tages for my Safety,
and de&s;ired they might be u&s;ed on Board
no otherwi&s;e than I was u&s;ed with him in
the Country.</P>
<P>I was a&s;hamed to accept &s;uch an Offer as
this; but he pre&s;&s;ed it earne&s;tly, and im|portuned
the Doctor to move me to accept
it, telling him, That he &s;hould not be ea&s;y
if I did not; &s;o that, in &s;hort, the Doctor ad|vi&s;ed
me to agree to it; and accordingly he
hired a Me&s;&s;enger and a Mule, and &s;ent away
<PB N="58" REF="269">
for his Two Sons to come to him; and &s;uel
Expedition the Me&s;&s;enger made, that in Six
Days he returned with the Two Sons, and
Three Servants, all on Hor&s;eback. His Two
Sons were very pretty well behaved Youths,
who appeared to be Gentlemen in their very
Countenances; the Elde&s;t was about Thir|teen
Years old, and the other about Ele|ven.
I treated them on Board, as I had done
their Father, with all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;pect; and
having entertained them Two Days, left
Order, that they &s;hould be treated in the
&s;ame Manner when I was gone; and to this
I added aloud (that their Father might hear
it) That whenever they had a Mind to go
away, they &s;hould let them go: But their
Father laid a great many &s;olemn Charges
upon them, that they &s;hould not &s;tir out of
the Ship 'till I came back &s;afe; and that I gave
them leave; and he made them promi&s;e, that
they would not; and the young Gentlemen
kept their Word &s;o punctually, that when
our <HI>Supra-Cargo,</HI> who I left in Command,
offered to let them go on Shore &s;everal Times,
to divert them with Shooting and Hunting,
they would not &s;tir out of the Ship, and did
not, 'till I came back again.</P>
<P>Having gone this Length, and made every
thing ready for my Adventure, we &s;et out,
Captain <HI>Merlote,</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Doctor, the old
Mutineer, that was my Second Mate, and
who was now the Captain of the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI>
Ship, and my&s;elf, with Two Mid&s;hip-men,
who we took as Servants, but who I re&s;olved
to make the Directors of the main Enterprize.
<PB REF="270">

<PB N="59" REF="271">
As to the Number, I found my <HI>Spaniard</HI> made
no Scruple of that, if it had been half my
Ship's Company.</P>
<P>We &s;et out, &s;ome on Hor&s;es, and &s;ome on
Mules, as we could get them, but the <HI>Spa|niard</HI>
and my&s;elf rode on Two very good
Hor&s;es, being the &s;ame that his Two Sons
came on. We arrived at a Noble Country Seat
about a League &s;hort of the Town, where,
at fir&s;t, I thought we had been only to put
in for Refre&s;hment; but I &s;oon found, that
it was really his Dwelling-Hou&s;e, and where
his Family and Servants re&s;ided.</P>
<P>Here we were received like Princes, and
with as much Ceremony as if he had been
a Prince that entertained us: The <HI>Mayor Domo,</HI>
or Steward of his Hou&s;e, received us, took
in our Baggage, and ordered our Two Ser|vants
to be taken care of.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> did
all, that Pride and Oftentation was capa|ble
of in&s;piring him with, to entertain us;
and the Truth is, He could not have lived in
a Country in the World more capable of gra|tifying
his Pride; for here, without any
thing uncommon, he was able to &s;hew more
Gold Plate, than many good Families, in
our Country, have of Silver; and as for Sil|ver,
it quite eclip&s;es the Appearance, or ra|ther
took away the very u&s;e of Pewter, of
which, we did not &s;ee one Ve&s;&s;el, no, not in
the meane&s;t Part of his Hou&s;e: It is true, I
believe, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had not a Piece of Plate,
or of any Hou&s;hold Furniture, which we did
not &s;ee, except what belonged to the Apart|ment
<PB N="60" REF="272">
of his Wife; and it is to be ob&s;erved.
That the Women never appeared, except at
a Di&s;tance, and in the Gardens, and then
being under Veils, we could not know the
Lady from her Women, or the Maids from
the Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>We were lodged every one in &s;eparate
Apartments, very well furni&s;hed, but Two
of them very nobly, indeed; though all the
Materials for Furniture mu&s;t be there at an
exce&s;&s;ive Price. The way of lodging upon
Quilts, and in Beds, made <HI>Pavillion</HI>-wi&s;e, after
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cu&s;tom, I need not de&s;cribe; but
it &s;urprized me to &s;ee the Rooms hung with
very rich Tape&s;tries, in a Part of the World
where they mu&s;t co&s;t &s;o dear.</P>
<P>We had <HI>Chilian</HI> Wine &s;erved us up in round
Gold Cups, and Water in large Silver Decan|ters,
that held, at lea&s;t, Five Quarts a Piece,
the&s;e &s;tood in our Chamber. Our Chocolate
was brought us up in the &s;ame Manner, in
deep Cups, all of Gold, and it was made in
Ve&s;&s;els all of Silver.</P>
<P>It would be trouble&s;ome to the very Rea|der,
to interrupt my Account with the Rela|tion
of all the fine Things he had in his Hou&s;e,
and I could not be per&s;uaded, but that he had
borrowed all the Plate in the Town to fur|ni&s;h
out his Side-board and Table; but my
Doctor told me, It was nothing but what was
very u&s;ual among them that were Men of
any Sub&s;tance, as it was apparent he was;
and that the Silver-Smiths at St. <HI>Jago</HI> &s;up|plied
them generally with their Plate ready
wrought, in Exchange (with Allowanc$ for
<PB N="61" REF="273">
the Quality) for the Gold which they found
in the Mountains, or in the Brooks and
Streams which came from the Mountains,
into which the ha&s;ty Showers of Winter Rain
frequently wa&s;hed down pretty large Lumps;
and others, which were &s;maller, they wa&s;hed
out of the Sands by the ordinary Methods
of wa&s;hing of Oar.</P>
<P>I was better &s;atisfied in this Particular,
when, the next Day, talking to our new Land|lord
about the Mountains, and the Wealth of
them, I a&s;ked him, If he could &s;hew me any
of the Gold which was u&s;ually wa&s;hed out
of the Hills by the Rain, in the natural Fi|gure
in which it was found? He &s;miled, and
told me Yes, he would &s;hew us a little; and
with that, carried us up into a kind of a
Clo&s;et, where he had a great Variety of odd
Things, gathered up about the Mountains and
Rivers, &s;uch as fine Shells, &s;trange Stones in
the Form of Stars, heavy Pieces of Oar, but
&s;uch as neither he, or any of us, could tell
what they were, and the like; and after this,
he pulled out a great Leather Bag, which had,
I believe, near Fifty Pounds weight in it, Here,
<HI>Seignior,</HI> &s;ays he, here is &s;ome of the Dirt
of the Earth, and turning it out upon the
Table, it was ea&s;y to &s;ee that it was all Gold,
though the Pieces were of different Forms,
and &s;ome &s;carce looking like Gold at all, being
&s;o mixed with the Sparr, or with Earth, that
it did not appear &s;o plain; but in every bit,
there was &s;omething of the clear Gold to be
&s;een, and the &s;maller the Lumps, the purer
the Gold appeared.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="274">
I was &s;urprized at the Quantity, more tha$
at the Thing it&s;elf, having, as I hav$
&s;aid, &s;een the Gold which the <HI>Indians</HI> foun$
in the Countries I have de&s;cribed, whic$
&s;eemed to have little or no Mixture; bu$t
then I was to have con&s;idered, That wha$t
tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> gathered, was farther from the
Hills which it came from, and that tho&s;e
rough, irregular Pieces would not drive &s;$o
far in the Water, but would lodge them&s;elves
in the Earth and Sand of the Rivers nearer
home; and al&s;o, that the <HI>Indians,</HI> not know|ing
how to &s;eparate the Gold by Fire from
the Dro&s;s and Mixture above, did not think
tho&s;e rough Pieces worth their taking up,
whereas the <HI>Spaniards</HI> here under&s;tood much
better, what they were about.</P>
<P>But to return to the Clo&s;et; When he had
&s;hewn us this Leather Pouch full, he &s;weeps
it by to one Side of the Table, which had
Ledges round it, to keep it from running off,
and takes up another Bag full of large Pieces
of Stone, great Lumps of Earth, and Pieces
of various Shapes, all of which had &s;ome
Gold in them, but not to be gotten out but
by Fire: The&s;e, he told us, their Servants
bring them home as they find them in the
Mountains, lying loo&s;e here and there, when
they run after their Cattle.</P>
<P>But &s;till I a&s;ked him, If they found no
Pieces of pure Gold? upon this, he turned to a
great old Cabinet full of pretty large Drawers,
and pulling out one Drawer, he &s;hewed us a
&s;urprizing Number of Pieces, of pure clean
Gold, &s;ome round, &s;ome long, &s;ome flat, &s;ome
<PB N="63" REF="275">
thick, all of irregular Shapes, and worked
roundi&s;h at the Ends, with rolling along, &s;ome
of the&s;e weighed a quarter of an Ounce, &s;ome
more, and &s;ome le&s;s, and as I lifted the
Drawer, I believe there could not be le&s;s than
between Twenty and Thirty Pound weight
of it.</P>
<P>Then he pulled out another Drawer, which
was almo&s;t full of the &s;ame kind of
Drug, but as &s;mall as Sand, the bigge&s;t not
&s;o big as Pins Heads, and which might very
properly be called Gold Du&s;t.</P>
<P>After this Sight, a Man was to be &s;urpriz'd
at nothing he could &s;ee; I a&s;k'd him, How
long &s;uch a Trea&s;ure might be ama&s;&s;ing toge|ther
in this Country? He told me, That was
according to the Pains they might take in the
Search; That he had been Twelve Years here,
and had done little or nothing; but had he
had Twenty Negroes to have &s;et on Work, as
he might have had, he might have had more
than this in one Year. I a&s;k'd him, How
much Gold in Weight he thought there might
be in all this he had &s;hewn me? he told me,
He could not tell; That they never troubled
them&s;elves to weigh, but when the Silver|&s;mith
at St. <HI>Jago</HI> came to bring home any
Ve&s;&s;el, or, when the Merchants from
<HI>Lima</HI> came to <HI>Baldivia</HI> with <HI>European</HI> Goods,
then they bought what they wanted of them;
That they were &s;en&s;ible they gave exce&s;&s;ive
dear for every Thing, even Ten or Twenty for
One: But as Gold, he &s;aid, was the Growth of
that Country, and the other Things, &s;uch as
Cloth, Linnen, &s;ine Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were the Gold
<PB N="64" REF="276">
of <HI>Europe,</HI> they did not think much to giv$
what they ask'd for tho&s;e Things. In &s;hort
I found, that the People in this Country
though they kept large Plantations in thei$r
Hands, had great Numbers of Cattle, <HI>Ingenios</HI>
as they call them, for making Sugar, and
Land, under Management, for the Maintenanc$e
of them&s;elves and Families; yet did no$t
wholly neglect the getting Gold out of th$e
Mountains, where it was in &s;uch Plenty; and
therefore it &s;eems the Town adjacent is called
<HI>Villa Rica,</HI> or <HI>The Rich Town,</HI> being &s;eated, as it
were, at the Foot of the Mountains, and in
the riche&s;t part of them.</P>
<P>After I had &s;ufficiently admir'd the va&s;t
Quantity of Gold he had, he made Signs to
the Doctor, That I &s;hould take any Piece or
any Quantity that I plea&s;ed; but thought$
I might take it as an Affront, to have him offer
me any particular &s;mall Parcel. The Doctor
hinted it to me, and I bad him return him
Thanks; but to let him know, that I would by
no Means have any of that, but that I would be
glad to take up a Piece or Two, &s;uch as Chance
&s;hould pre&s;ent to me in the Mountains; that
I might &s;hew in my own Country, and tell
them, that I took it up with my own Hands:
He an&s;wer'd, He would go with me him&s;elf;
and doubted not, but to carry me where I
&s;hould fully &s;atisfy my Curio&s;ity, if I would
be content to clamber a little among the
Rocks.</P>
<P>I now began to &s;ee plainly, that I had no
manner of Need to have taken his Sons for Ho|&s;tages,
for my Safety; and would &s;ain have
<PB N="65" REF="277">
&s;ent for them back again; but he would by
no Means give me Leave; &s;o I was oblig'd
to give that over. A Day or two after, I de|&s;ir'd
of him, That he would give me Leave
to &s;end for one Per&s;on more from the Ships,
who I had a great Mind &s;hould &s;ee the
Country with me, and to &s;end for &s;ome few
Things that I &s;hould want, and, withal, to
&s;atisfy my Men, that I was &s;afe and well.</P>
<P>This he con&s;ented to; &s;o I &s;ent away one of
the two Mid&s;hip-Men, who I call'd my Servants,
and with him Two Servants of the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
my Landlord, as I call'd him, with Four
Mules and Two Hor&s;es: I gave my Mid|&s;hip-Man
my Orders and Directions under
my Hand, to my <HI>Supra-Cargo</HI> what to do; for
I was re&s;olv'd to be even with my <HI>Spaniard</HI>
for all his good U&s;age of me; the Mid&s;hip-Man
was gone Ten Days, for they came back
pretty well laden, as you &s;hall hear, and the
Men were oblig'd to come all on Foot.</P>
<P>All the while they were gone, my Landlord
and I &s;pent in &s;urveying the Country, and
viewing his Plantation: As for the City of
<HI>Villa Rica,</HI> it was not the mo&s;t proper to go
there in Publick; and the Doctor knew that
as well as the <HI>Spaniard;</HI> and therefore, tho'
we went &s;everal Times <HI>incognito,</HI> yet it was
of no Con&s;equence to me, neither did I de|&s;ire
it.</P>
<P>One Night I had a very &s;trange Fright here$
and behav'd my&s;elf very much like a Fool about
it: The Ca&s;e was this; I wak'd in the Middle
of the Night, and chancing to open my Eyes,
I &s;aw a great Light of Fire, which to me
<PB N="66" REF="278">
&s;eem'd as if the Hou&s;e, or &s;ome Part of it, had
been on Fire; I, as if I had been at <HI>Wapping</HI> or
<HI>Rotherhith,</HI> where People are always terrify'd
with &s;uch Things, jump'd out of Bed, and
call'd my Friend Captain <HI>Merlote,</HI> and cry'd
out, Fire, Fire! The fir&s;t Thing I &s;hould have
thought of, on this Occa&s;ion, &s;hould have
been, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> did not under&s;tand
what the Words Fire, Fire! meant; and, that
if I expected they &s;hould under&s;tand me, I
&s;hould, have cry'd <HI>Fuego, Fuego!</HI></P>
<P>However, Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> got up, and
my <HI>Madega&s;car</HI> Captain, for we all lay near
one another, and with the Noi&s;e they waked
the whole Hou&s;e; and my Landlord, as he af|terwards
confe&s;s'd, began to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome Mi&s;|chief;
his Steward having come to his Cham|ber-Door,
and told him, that the Strangers
were up in Arms; in which Mi&s;take we might
all have had our Throats cut, and the poor
<HI>Spaniard</HI> not to blame neither.</P>
<P>But our Doctor coming ha&s;tily in to me,
unriddled the whole Matter, which was this,
That a Volcano, or Burning Vent among the
Hills, being pretty near the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Side of the
Country, as there are many of them in the
<HI>Andes,</HI> had flam'd out that Night, and gave
&s;uch a terrible Light in the Air, as made us
think the Fire had at lea&s;t been in the Out-Hou&s;es,
or in part of the Hou&s;e, and according|ly
had put me in &s;uch a Fright.</P>
<P>Upon this, having told me what it was,
he ran away to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Servants, and
told them what the Meaning of it all was;
and bad them go and &s;atisfy their Ma&s;ter,
<PB N="67" REF="279">
which they did; and all was well again; but
as for me, I &s;at almo&s;t all the Night &s;taring
out at Window at the Eruption of Fire upon
the Hills, and the like Bonfire I had never
&s;een before, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely begg'd my Landlord's Pardon for
di&s;turbing his Hou&s;e; and ask'd him, If tho&s;e
Eruptions were frequent? he &s;aid, No, they
were not frequent, for they were con&s;tant, ei|ther
in one Part of the Hills or another; and
that in my pa&s;&s;ing the Mountains I &s;hould
&s;ee &s;everal of them. I a&s;k'd him, If they
were not alarm'd with them? and if they
were not attended with Earthquakes? He
&s;aid, He believ'd that among the Hills them|&s;elves,
they might have &s;ome Shakings of the
Earth, becau&s;e &s;ometimes they &s;hould find
Pieces of the Rocks break off, and fall
down; and that it was among tho&s;e little
Fractures that &s;ometimes Pieces of Stone were
found which had Gold inter&s;pers'd in them, as
if they had been melted and run together; of
which he had &s;hewn me &s;ome: But that as
for Earthquakes in the Country, he had ne|ver
heard of any, &s;ince he came thither,
which had been upwards of Fifteen Years,
including Three Years that he dwelt at
<HI>St. Jago.</HI></P>
<P>One Day, being out on Hor&s;eback with
my Landlord, we rode up clo&s;e to the Moun|tains,
and he &s;hew'd me at a Di&s;tance an
Entrance, as he call'd it, into them, fright|ful
enough indeed; as you &s;hall hear in its
Place: Then he told me, That was the Way
he intended to carry me when he &s;hould go to
<PB N="68" REF="280">
&s;hew me the highe&s;t Hills in the World: But
he turn'd &s;hort, and, &s;miling, &s;aid, It &s;houl
not be yet; for tho' he had promi&s;ed me a
&s;afe Return, and left Ho&s;tages for it, yet he
had not capitulated for Time.</P>
<P>I told him, He need not capitulate with
me for Time; for if I had not Two Ships
to &s;tay my Coming, and between Three and
Four Hundred Men eating me up all the
while, I did not know whether I wou'd ever
go away again, or no, if he would give me
Hou&s;e-room. He told me, As to that, he
had &s;ent my Men &s;ome Victuals, &s;o that they
wou'd not &s;tarve if I did not come back for
&s;ome Days. This &s;urpriz'd me a little, and I
di&s;covered it in my Countenance. Nay, Seig|nior,
&s;ays he, I have only &s;ent them &s;ome
Victuals to maintain my Two Ho&s;tages; for,
you know, they mu&s;t not want. It was
not Good-Manners in me to a&s;k what he had
&s;ent; but I under&s;tood, as &s;oon as my Mid|&s;hip-man
return'd, that he had &s;ent down
Sixteen Cows or Runts, I know not what to
call them, but black Cattle; Thirty Hogs,
Thirteen large <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep, as big as
great Calves; and Three <HI>Ca&s;ks</HI> of <HI>Chilian</HI>
Wine, with an A&s;&s;urance, that they &s;hould
have more Provi&s;ions when that was &s;pent.</P>
<P>I was amaz'd at all this Munificence of
the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and very glad I was, that I had
&s;ent my Mid&s;hip-man for the Things I in|tended
to pre&s;ent him again; for I was as
well able to requite him for a large Pre&s;ent as
he was to make it, and had re&s;olv'd it be|fore
I knew he had &s;ent any Thing to the
<PB N="69" REF="281">
Ship; &s;o that this exchanging of Pre&s;ents
was but a kind of generous Barter or Com|merce:
For as to Gold, we had either of us
&s;o much, that it was not at all equal in Va|lue
to what we had to give on both Sides,
as we were at pre&s;ent &s;tated.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, my Mid&s;hip-man return'd with
the Hor&s;es and Servants; and when we had
brought what I had &s;ent for into a Place
which I de&s;ired the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to allow me to
open my Things in, I &s;ent my Doctor to de|&s;ire
the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to let me &s;peak with him.</P>
<P>I told him, fir&s;t, That he mu&s;t give me
his Parole of Honour not to take ami&s;s what
I had to &s;ay to him; That it was the Cu|&s;tom
in our Country, at any Time, to make
Pre&s;ents to the Ladies, with the Knowledge
and Con&s;ent of their Hu&s;bands or Parents,
without any evil De&s;ign, or without giving
any Offence; but that I knew it was not
&s;o among the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> That I had not had
the Honour yet either to &s;ee his Lady or his
Daughter, but that I had heard he had a
Lady and a Daughter al&s;o: However, that
if he pleas'd; to be the Me&s;&s;enger of a Tri$le
I had caus'd my Man to bring, and would
pre&s;ent it for me, and not take it as an Of|fence,
he &s;hould &s;ee before-hand what it was,
and I would content my &s;elf with his accept|ing
it in their Behalf.</P>
<P>He told me, &s;miling, He did not bring
me thither to take any Pre&s;ents of me; I
had already done enough, in that I had gi|ven
him his Liberty, which was the mo&s;t
valuable Gift in the World; and as to his
<PB N="70" REF="282">
Wife, I had already made her the be&s;t Pre|&s;ent
I was able, having given her back her
Hu&s;band; That it is true, it was not the Cu|&s;tom
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to let their Wives ap|pear
in any publick Entertainment of Friends,
but that he had re&s;olv'd to break through
that Cu&s;tom; and that he had told his Wife,
What a Friend I had been to her Family,
and that &s;he &s;hould thank me for it in Pub|lick;
and that then, what Pre&s;ent I had de|&s;ign'd
for her, &s;ince I would be a Maker of
Pre&s;ents, &s;he &s;hould do her&s;elf the Honour
to take it with her own Hands, and he
wou'd be very far from mi&s;taking them, or
taking it ill from his Wife.</P>
<P>As this was the highe&s;t Compliment he
was able to make me, the more he was
obliging in the Manner; for he returned in
about Two Hours, leading his Wife into the
Room by the Hand, and his Daughter fol|lowing.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was &s;urpriz'd, for I did
not expect to have &s;een &s;uch a Sight in <HI>Ame|rica.</HI>
The Lady's Dre&s;s indeed I cannot de|&s;cribe,
but &s;he was really a charming Wo|man
in her Per&s;on, of about Forty Years
of Age, and cover'd over with Emeralds and
Diamonds, I mean, as to her Head. She
was veil'd till &s;he came into the Room, but
gave her Veil to her Woman when her Hu&s;|band
took her by the Hand. Her Daughter
I took to be about Twelve Years old, which
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> count Marriageable; She was
pretty, but not &s;o hand&s;ome as her Mo|ther.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="283">
After the Compliments on both Sides,
my Landlord, as I now call him, told her
very hand&s;omely what a Benefactor I had been
to her Family, by redeeming him from
the Hands of Villains: And &s;he, turning to
me, thank'd me in the mo&s;t obliging Man|ner,
and with a mode&s;t graceful Way of
Speech, &s;uch as I cannot repre&s;ent, and which,
indeed, I did not think the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who
are &s;aid to be &s;o haughty, had been acquaint|ed
with.</P>
<P>I then de&s;ired the Doctor to tell the <HI>Spa|niard</HI>
her Hu&s;band, That I de&s;ir'd his Lady
to accept a &s;mall Pre&s;ent which my Mid&s;hip-man
had brought for her from the Ship, and
which, <HI>with his Words,</HI> I took in my Hand,
and the <HI>Spaniard</HI> led his Wife on to take it:
And I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, It was not a mean
Pre&s;ent, be&s;ides, its being of Ten Times
the Value in that Place, as it would have
been at <HI>London,</HI> and I was now very glad
that, as I mentioned above, I always re|&s;erved
a &s;mall Quantity of all Sorts of Goods
un&s;old, that I might have them to di&s;po&s;e of
as Occa&s;ion &s;hould offer.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I pre&s;ented her with a very $ine
Piece of <HI>Dutch</HI> Holland, worth, in <HI>London,</HI>
about Seven Shillings an Ell, and Thirty-&s;ix
Ells in Length, and worth in <HI>Chili,</HI> to be &s;ure,
Fifteen Pieces of Eight <HI>per</HI> Ell, at lea&s;t; or it
was rather likely, that all the Kingdom of
<HI>Chili</HI> had not &s;uch another.</P>
<P>Then I gave her Two Pieces of <HI>China</HI> Da|ma&s;k,
and Two Pieces of <HI>China</HI> Silks called
Atla&s;&s;es, flowered with Gold; Two Pieces of
<PB N="72" REF="284">
fine Mu&s;lin, one flower'd, the other plain,
and a Piece of very fine Chints, or printed
Callicoe; al&s;o a large Parcel of Spices, made
up in blue Papers, being about Six Pounds of
Nutmegs, and about twice as many Cloves.</P>
<P>And, la&s;tly, To the young Lady I gave
One Piece of Dama&s;k, Two Pieces of <HI>China</HI>
Taffity, and a Piece of fine &s;triped Mu&s;lin.</P>
<P>After all this was delivered, and the La|dies
had received them, and given them their
Women to hold, I pulled out a little Box,
in which I had Two Couple of large Pearls,
of that Pearl which I mentioned we found at
the Pearl I&s;lands, very well matched for Ear|rings,
and gave the Lady one Pair, and the
Daughter the other; And now, I think, I had
made a Pre&s;ent $it for an Amba&s;&s;ador to carry
to a Prince.</P>
<P>The Ladies made all po&s;&s;ible Acknowledg|ment,
and we had the Honour that Day to
dine with them in Publick. My Landlord,
the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> told me, I had given them &s;uch
a Pre&s;ent, as the Viceroy of <HI>Mexico</HI>'s Lady
would have gone Fifty Leagues to have re|ceived.</P>
<P>But I had not done with my Ho&s;t; for,
after Dinner, I took him into the &s;ame Room,
and told him, I hoped he did not think I
had made all my Pre&s;ents to the Ladies, and
had nothing left to &s;hew my Re&s;pect to him;
and, therefore, fir&s;t I pre&s;ented him with
Three Negroe-men, which I had bought at
<HI>Callao</HI> for my own U&s;e, but knew I could &s;up|ply
my&s;elf again at or in my way home,
at a moderate Price; in the next Place, I
<PB N="73" REF="285">
gave him Three Pieces of Black <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI>
Bays, which, though they are coar&s;e ordi|nary
Things in <HI>England,</HI> that a Footman
would &s;carce wear, are a Habit for a Prince
in that Country; I then gave him a Piece of
very fine Scarlet <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Serge, which was
really very valuable in <HI>England,</HI> but much
more there; and another Piece of Crim&s;on
Broad-Cloth, and Six Pieces of fine Silk Drug|gets
for his Two Sons, and thus I fini&s;hed
my Pre&s;ents. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;tood &s;till, and
looked on all the while I was laying out my
Pre&s;ents to him, as one in a Tran&s;port, and
&s;aid not one Word 'till all was over; But then
he told me very gravely, That it was now
time for him to turn me out of his Hou&s;e;
For, Seignior, &s;ays he, no Man ought to &s;uf|fer
him&s;elf to be obliged beyond his Power
of Return, and I have no po&s;&s;ible way of mak|ing
any Return to you equal to &s;uch Things
as the&s;e.</P>
<P>It is true, the Pre&s;ent I had made him, if
it was to be rated by the Value of Things
in the Country where it then was, would
have been valued at Six or Seven hundred
Pounds Sterling, but to rekon them as they
might co&s;t me, did not all together amount to
above One hundred Pounds, except the Three
Negroes, which, indeed, co&s;t me at <HI>Lima</HI> One
thou&s;and Two hundred Pieces of Eight.</P>
<P>He was as &s;en&s;ible of the Price of tho&s;e Ne|groes,
as I was of the Occa&s;ion he had of them,
and of the Work he had to do for them; and
he came to me about an Hour after, and
told me, He had looked over all the Particu|lars
<PB N="74" REF="286">
of the noble Pre&s;ents which I had made
them; and though the Value was too great
for him to accept, or for any Man to offer
him, yet, &s;ince I had been at &s;o much Trou|ble
to &s;end for the Things, and that I thought
him worthy &s;uch a Bounty, he was come
back to tell me, That he accepted, thankfully,
all my Pre&s;ents, both to him&s;elf, and to his
Wife and Daughter, except only the Three
Negroes, and as they were bought in the
Country, and were the particular Traffick of
the Place, he could not take them as a Pre|&s;ent;
but would be equally obliged, and take
It for as much a Favour, if I would allow
him to pay for them.</P>
<P>I &s;miled, and told him, He and I would
agree upon that; for he did not yet know
what Favours I had to a&s;k of him, and what
Expence I &s;hould put him to; That I had a
great De&s;ign in my View, which I was to
crave his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in, and which I had not
yet communicated to him, in which he
might, perhaps, find, that he would pay dear
enough for all the little Pre&s;ents I had made
him; and, in the mean time, to make him|&s;elf
ea&s;y as to the Three Negroe-men, I gave
him my Word, that he &s;hould pay for them;
only not yet.</P>
<P>He could have nothing to object again&s;t an
Offer of this kind, becau&s;e he could not gue&s;s
what I meant; but gave me all the A&s;&s;ur|ances
of Service and A&s;&s;i&s;tance that lay in his
Power, in any thing that I might have to do
in that Country.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="287">
But here, by the way, you are to under|&s;tand,
that all this was carry'd on with a
Suppo&s;ition, that we acted under a Com|mi&s;&s;ion
from the King of <HI>France;</HI> and though
he knew many of us were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and that
I was an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> in particular, yet, as
we had &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion, and produced it,
we were <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> in that Sen&s;e, to him,
nor did he entertain us upon any other
Foot.</P>
<P>The Sequel of the Story will al&s;o make it
&s;ufficiently appear, That I did not make
&s;uch Pre&s;ents as the&s;e in meer O&s;tentation,
or only upon the Compliment of a Vi&s;it to
a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentleman, any more than I would
leave my Ship, and a Cargo of &s;uch Value,
in the manner I had done, to make a Tour
into the Country, if had not had Views &s;uf|ficient
to ju&s;tify &s;uch Beginnings; and the
Con&s;equence of the&s;e Things, will be the be&s;t
Apology for me, to tho&s;e who &s;hall have Pa|tience
to put them all together.</P>
<P>We had now &s;pent a Fortnight, and &s;ome|thing
more, in Ceremony and Civilities, and
in, now and then, taking a little Tour about
the Fields, and towards the Mountains.
However, even in this way of living, I was
not &s;o idle as I &s;eemed to be, for I not only
made due Ob&s;ervations of all the Country
which I &s;aw, but informed my&s;lef &s;ufficiently
of the Parts which I did not &s;ee. I found the
Country not only fruitful in the Soil, but
wonderful temperate and agreeable in its Cli|mate.
The Air, though hot, according to
its proper Latitude, yet that Heat &s;o mo|derated
<PB N="76" REF="288">
by the cool Breezes from the Moun|tains,
that it was rather equal to the plai$n
Countries in other Parts of the World, i$n
the Latitude of Fifty, than to a Climate i$n
Thirty-eight to Forty Degrees.</P>
<P>This gave the Inhabitants the Advantages
not only of plea&s;ant and agreeable living
but al&s;o of a particular Fertility, which ho$t
Climates are not ble&s;&s;ed with, e&s;pecially a$
to Corn, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary of all Productions
&s;uch as Wheat, I mean <HI>European</HI> Wheat, o$n
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wheat, which grew here as well and
as kindly, as in <HI>England;</HI> which in <HI>Peru</HI>
and in the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> will by n$o
means thrive for want of Moi&s;ture and
Cold.</P>
<P>Here were, al&s;o, an excellent middling
Breed of Black Cattle, which they fed un|der
the Shade of the Mountains, and on the
Banks of the Rivers, 'till they came to be
very fat. In a Word, here were, or might
be produced, all the Plants, Fruits, and
Grain, of a temperate Climate. At the &s;ame
Time, the Orange, Limon, Citron, Pome|grenate,
and Figs, with a moderate Care,
would come to a very tolerable Perfection
in their Gardens; and even Sugar-Canes, in
&s;ome Places, though the&s;e la&s;t but rarely, and
not without great Art in the Cultivation, and
chiefly in Gardens.</P>
<P>They a&s;&s;ured me, That farther <HI>Southward</HI>
beyond <HI>Baldivia,</HI> and to the Latitude of For|ty-&s;even
to Forty-nine, the Lands were
e&s;teemed richer than where we now were;
the Gra&s;s more &s;trengthening and nouri&s;hing
<PB N="77" REF="289">
for the Cattle; and that, con&s;equently, the
Black Cattle, Hor&s;es, and Hogs, were all of
a larger Breed; but that, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
had no Settlement beyond <HI>Baldivia</HI> to the
<HI>South,</HI> &s;o they did not find the Natives &s;o
tractable as where we then were; where,
though the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were but few, and the
Strength they had, was but &s;mall, yet, as
upon any Occa&s;ion, they had always been
a&s;&s;i&s;ted with Forces &s;ufficient from St. <HI>Jago,</HI>
and, if need were, even from <HI>Peru,</HI> &s;o the
Natives had always been &s;ubdued, and had
found them&s;elves obliged to &s;ubmit; and
that now they were intirely reduced, and
were, and had been, for &s;everal Years, very
ea&s;y and quiet: Be&s;ides the plentiful Harve&s;t
which they made of Gold from the Moun|tains
(which appeared to be the great Allure|ment
of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) had drawn them ra|ther
to &s;ettle here, than farther <HI>Southward,</HI>
being naturally addicted, as my new Land|lord
confe&s;&s;ed to me, to reap the Harve&s;t
which had the lea&s;t Labour and Hazard at|tending
it, and the mo&s;t Profit.</P>
<P>Not but that, at the &s;ame Time, he con|fe&s;&s;ed,
That he believed, and had heard, that
there was as much Gold to be found farther
to the <HI>South,</HI> as far as the Mountains conti|nued;
but that, as I have &s;aid, the Natives
were more trouble&s;ome, and more dangerous,
than where they now lived; and that the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> did not allow Troops &s;ufficient
to civilize and reduce them.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="290">
I a&s;ked him concerning the Natives in th$e
Country where we were? he told me, The$y
were the mo&s;t quiet, and inoffen&s;ive People
&s;ince the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had reduced them by Force
that could be de&s;ired; That they were not
indeed, Numerous, or Warlike, the Warlike
and Ob&s;tinate Part of them having fled far
ther off to the <HI>South,</HI> as they were overpower|ed
by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> That for tho&s;e that were
left, they lived &s;ecure, under the Protection
of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Governor; That they fed Cattle,
and planted the Country, and &s;old the Pro|duct
of their Lands very much to the <HI>Spa|niards;</HI>
but that they did not covet to be
rich, only to obtain Cloaths, Arms, Powder
and Shot; which, however, they let them
have but &s;paringly, and with good A&s;&s;urance
of their Fidelity. I a&s;ked him, If they were
not treacherous and per&s;idious? And if it
was not dangerous tru&s;ting them&s;elves among
them in the Mountains, and among the re|tired
Places where they dwelt? he told me,
That it was quite the contrary; that they
were &s;o hone&s;t, and &s;o harmle&s;s, that he
would at any Time venture to &s;end his Two
Sons into the Mountains a Hunting, with
each of them a <HI>Chilian</HI> for his Guide, and let
them &s;tay with the &s;aid Natives Two or
Three Nights and Days at a Time, and be
in no Unea&s;ine&s;s about them; and that none
of them were ever known to do any foul or
treacherous thing by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;ince he
had been in that Country.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="291">
Having thus fully informed my&s;elf of
Things, I began now to think it was high
Time to &s;ee the main Sight which I came to
enquire after (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Pa&s;&s;ages of the Moun|tains,
and the Wonders that were to be di&s;|covered
on the other Side; and accordingly
I took my Patron the <HI>Spaniard</HI> by him&s;elf,
and told him, That as I was a Traveller, and
was now in &s;uch a remote Part of the World,
he could not but think I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee
every thing extraordinary, that was to be
&s;een; that I might be able to give &s;ome Ac|count
of the World when I came into <HI>Europe,</HI>
better, and differing from what others had
done, who had been there before me; and
that I had a great mind, if he would give
me his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to enter into the Pa&s;&s;ages
and Valleys which he had told me &s;o much
of in the Mountains, and, if it was po&s;&s;ible,
<HI>which, indeed, I had always thought it was not,</HI>
to take a Pro&s;pect of the World on the other
Side.</P>
<P>He told me, It was not a light Piece of
Work, and, perhaps, the Di&s;coveries might
not an&s;wer my Trouble, there being little to
be &s;een but &s;teep Precipices, unho&s;pitable
Rocks, and unpa&s;&s;able Mountains, immuring
us on every Side, innumerable Rills and
Brooks of Water falling from the Clifts,
making a barbarous and unplea&s;ant Sound;
and that Sound eccho'd and reverberated from
innumerable Cavities and Hollows among
the Rocks, and the&s;e all pouring down into
one Middle Stream, which we &s;hould always
find on one Side or other of us as we went,
<PB N="80" REF="292">
and that &s;ometimes, we &s;hould be obliged to
pa&s;s tho&s;e middle Streams, as well as the
Rills and Brooks on the Sides, without a
Bridge, and at the Expence of pulling off our
Cloaths.</P>
<P>He told us, That we &s;hould meet, indeed,
with Provi&s;ions enough, and with an inno|cent
harmle&s;s People, who, according to their
Ability, would entertain us very willingly;
but that I who was a Stranger, would be
&s;orely put to it for Lodging, e&s;pecially for &s;o
many of us.</P>
<P>However, he &s;aid, as he had, perhaps, at
fir&s;t, rai&s;ed this Curio&s;ity in me, by giving
me a favourable Account of the Place, he
would be very far from di&s;couraging me now;
and that if I re&s;olved to go, he would not
only endeavour to make every thing as
plea&s;ant to me as he could, but that he and
his <HI>Mayor Domo</HI> would go along with me,
and &s;ee us &s;afe through, and &s;afe home again&punc;
but de&s;ired me, not to be in too much ha&s;te,
for that he mu&s;t make &s;ome little Preparation
for the Journey, which, as he told us, might,
perhaps, take us up Fourteen or Sixteen Days
forward, and as much backagain; Not, he &s;aid,
that it was nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould be &s;o
long going and coming, as that he &s;uppo&s;ed
I would take time to &s;ee every thing which
I might think worth &s;eeing, and not be in &s;o
much ha&s;te, as if I was &s;ent Expre&s;s. I told
him, He was very much in the right; That I
did not de&s;ire to make a thing, which I
expected &s;o much Plea&s;ure in, be a Toil to me
more than needs mu&s;t; and above all, that, as
<PB N="81" REF="293">
I &s;uppo&s;ed, I &s;hould not return into the&s;e
Parts very &s;oon, I would not take a cur&s;ory
View of a Place, which I expected would be
&s;o well worth &s;eeing, and let it be known to
all I &s;hould &s;peak of it to, that I wanted to
&s;ee it again, before I could give a full Ac|count
of it.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Seignior,</HI> &s;ays he, we will not be in
ha&s;te, or view it by halves; for if wild and
uncouth Places will be a Diver&s;ion to you, I
promi&s;e my&s;elf your Curio&s;ity &s;hall be fully
gratify'd; but as to extraordinary Things,
Rarities in Nature, and &s;urprizing Incidents
which Foreigners expect, I cannot &s;ay much
to that. However, what think you, Seignior,
&s;ays he, if we &s;hould take a Tour a little
way into the Entrance of the Hills, which I
&s;hewed you the other Day, and look upon
the Gate of this Gulph? Perhaps your Cu|rio&s;ity
may be &s;atisfy'd with the Fir&s;t Day's
Pro&s;pect, which, I a&s;&s;ure you, will be none of
the mo&s;t plea&s;ant, and you may find your&s;elf
&s;ick of the Enterprize.</P>
<P>I told him, No; I was &s;o re&s;olved upon the
Attempt, &s;ince he, who, I was &s;atisfy'd, would
not deceive me, had repre&s;ented it as &s;o
feazible, and e&s;pecially &s;ince he had offered
to conduct me through it, that I would not,
for all the Gold that was in the Mountains,
lay it a&s;ide. He &s;hook his Head at that Ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
and &s;miling at the Doctor, &s;ays he,
This Gentleman little thinks that there is more
Gold in the&s;e Mountains, nay, even in this
Part where we are, than there is now above
Ground in the whole World: Partly un|der&s;tanding
<PB N="82" REF="294">
what he &s;aid, I an&s;wered, My
Meaning was, To let him &s;ee, that nothing
could divert me from the purpo&s;e of viewing
the Place, unle&s;s he him&s;elf forbid me, which,
I hoped he would not; and that as for looking
a little way into the Pa&s;&s;age, to try if the
Horror of the Place would put a Check to
my Curio&s;ity, I would not give him that Trou|ble,
&s;eeing the more terrible and frightful, the
more difficult and impracticable it was, pro|vided
it could be ma&s;ter'd at la&s;t, the more
it would plea&s;e me to attempt and over|come
it.</P>
<P>Nay, nay, Seignior, <HI>&s;aid he plea&s;antly,</HI>
there's nothing difficult or impracticable in
it, nor is it any thing but what the Country-People,
and even &s;ome of our Nation, per|form
every Day; and that, not only by
them&s;elves, either for Sport in pur&s;uit of Game,
but even with Droves of Cattle, which they
go with from Place to Place, as to a Market,
or a Fair; and, therefore, if the Horror of
the Clifts and Precipices, the Noi&s;es of the
<HI>Volcanos,</HI> the Fire, and &s;uch Things as you
may &s;ee and hear above you, will not put a
Stop to your Curio&s;ity, I a&s;&s;ure you, you
&s;hall not meet with any thing unpa&s;&s;able or
impracticable below, nor any thing but what,
with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, and the Ble&s;&s;ed
Virgin (<HI>and then he cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and &s;o we
did all</HI>) we &s;hall go chearfully over.</P>
<P>Finding, therefore, that I was thus re&s;o|lutely
bent upon the Enterprize, but not in
the lea&s;t gue&s;$$ng at my De&s;ign, he gave
Order to have Servants and Mules provided,
<PB N="83" REF="295">
for Mules are much &s;itter to travel among
the Hills than Hor&s;es; and in Four Days he
promi&s;ed to be ready for a March.</P>
<P>I had nothing to do in all the&s;e Four Days,
but to walk abroad, and, as we &s;ay, look
about me; but I took this Opportunity to
give In&s;tructions to my Two Mid&s;hip men,
who were called my Servants, in what they
were to do.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I charged them to make Land-marks,
Bearings, and Beacons, as we might call them,
upon the Points of the Rocks above them, and
at every Turning in the Way below them, al|&s;o
at the Reaches and Windings of the Rivers
or Brooks, Falls of Water, and every thing
remarkable; and to keep each of them &s;epa|rate
and di&s;tinct Journals of tho&s;e Things;
not only to find the Way back again by the
&s;ame Steps; but that they might be able to
find that Way afterwards by them&s;elves, and
without Guides, which was the Bottom and
true Intent of all the re&s;t of my Undertak|ing;
and as I knew the&s;e were both capable
to do it, and had Courage and Fidelity to
undertake it, I had &s;ingled them out for the
Attempt, and had made them fully acquaint|ed
with my whole Scheme, and, con&s;equent|ly,
they knew the Meaning and Rea&s;on of
my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e with them: They
promi&s;ed not to fail to &s;hew me a Plan of
the Hills, with the Bearings of every Point,
one with another, where every Step was
to be taken, and every Turning to the Right
Hand, or to the Left, and &s;uch a Journal, I
believe, was never &s;een before, or &s;ince; but
<PB N="84" REF="296">
'tis too long for this Place. I &s;hall, how|ever,
take out the Heads of it as I go along,
which may &s;erve as a general De&s;cription of
the Place.</P>
<P>The Evening of the Fourth Day, as he had
appointed, my Friend the <HI>Spaniard</HI> let me
know, That he was ready to &s;et out, and
accordingly we began our Cavalcade: My
Retinue con&s;i&s;ted of Six, as before, and
we had Mules provided for us; my Two
Mid&s;hip-men, as Servants, had Two Mules
given them al&s;o for their Baggage: the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
had Six al&s;o, <HI>viz.</HI> His Gentleman, or, <HI>as</HI> I
<HI>called him before,</HI> his MAYOR DOMO, on
Hor&s;e-back, that is to &s;ay, On Mule-back,
with Mules for his Baggage, and Four Ser|vants
on Foot. Ju&s;t before we &s;et out, his
Gentleman brought every one of us a Fuzee,
and our Two Servants, each a Harquebu&s;h,
or &s;hort Mu&s;ket, with Cartouches, Powder
and Ball, and adjoyned a Pouch with &s;mall
Shot, &s;uch as we call Swan-Shot, for Fowls,
or Deer, as we &s;aw Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was as well plea&s;ed with this, as with
any thing, becau&s;e I had not &s;o intire a Con|fidence
in the Native <HI>Chilians,</HI> as he had;
but I &s;aw plainly, &s;ome Time after, that I
was wrong in that, for nothing could be more
hone&s;t, quiet, and free from De&s;ign, than
tho&s;e People, except the poor hone&s;t People
where we dre&s;&s;ed up the King and Queen, as
above.</P>
<P>We were late in the Morning before we
got out, having all this Equipage to furni&s;h,
and travelling very gently, it was about Two
<PB N="85" REF="297">
Hours before Sun-&s;et, when we came to the
Entrance of the Mountains, where, to my
Surprize, I found we were to go in upon a
Level, without any A&s;cent, at lea&s;t, that
was con&s;iderable: We had, indeed, gone up
upon a pretty &s;harp A&s;cent, for near Two
Miles, before we came to the Place.</P>
<P>The Entrance was agreeable enough, the
Pa&s;&s;age being near Half a Mile broad. On
the Left Hand, was a &s;mall River, who&s;e
Channel was deep, but the Water &s;hallow,
there having been but little Rain for &s;ome
Time; the Water ran very rapid, and, as
my <HI>Spaniard</HI> told me, was &s;ometimes exceed|ing
fierce; the Entrance lay inclining a
little <HI>South,</HI> and was &s;o &s;traight, that we
could &s;ee near a Mile before us; but the pro|digious
Height of the Hills on both Sides, and
before us, appearing one over another, gave
&s;uch a Pro&s;pect of Horror, that, I confe&s;s, it
was frightful at fir&s;t to look on the &s;tupendous
Height of the Rocks: Every thing before us
looking one higher than another, was amazing;
and to &s;ee how, in &s;ome Places, they hungover
the River, and over the Pa&s;&s;age, it threatned
a Man with being, &s;ome Time or other,
&s;wallowed up.</P>
<P>The Rocks and Precipices on our Right
Hand, had, here and there va&s;t Clefts
and Entrances, which looked as if they had
been different Thorough-fairs; but when we
came to look full into them, we could &s;ee
them clo&s;e up at the farther End, and go off
in Slopes, and with Gullies made by the Water,
which, in ha&s;$y Rains, came pouring down
<PB N="86" REF="298">
from the Hills, and which, at a Di&s;tance,
made &s;uch Noi&s;es, as 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to con|ceive,
unle&s;s by having &s;een and heard the
like; for the Water failing &s;ometimes from
a Height Twenty Times as high as the Mo|nument,
and, perhaps, much more, and meet|ing
in the Pa&s;&s;age with many Da&s;hes and
Interruptions, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe how,
the Sound cro&s;&s;ing, and interfering, mingled
it&s;elf, and the &s;everal Noi&s;es &s;unk one into
another, increa&s;ing the Whole, as the many
Waters joining, increa&s;ed the main Stream.</P>
<P>We entred this Pa&s;&s;age about Two Miles
the fir&s;t Night: After the fir&s;t Length, which,
as I &s;aid, held about Three Quarters of a
Mile, we turned away to the <HI>South,</HI> &s;hort
on the Right Hand; the River leaving us,
&s;eemed to come through a very narrow, but
deep, Hollow of the Mountains, where there
was little more Breadth at the Bottom, than
the Channel took up, though the Rocks gave
back as they a&s;cended, as placed in &s;everal
Stages, though all horrid and irregular, and
we could &s;ee nothing but Blackne&s;s and Ter|ror
all the Way. I was glad our Way did
not turn on that Side, but wondred, that we
&s;hould leave the River, and the more, when
I found, that in the Way we went, having
fir&s;t mounted gently a green plea&s;ant Slope,
when it declined again, we found, as it were,
a New Rivulet began in the Middle, and
the Water ran <HI>S. E</HI> or thereabouts: This made
me begin to a&s;k, If the Water went away in|to
the New World beyond the Hills? My
Patron &s;miled, and &s;aid, No, Seignior, not
<PB N="87" REF="299">
yet; we &s;hall meet with the other River
again very quickly; and &s;o we found it the
next Morning.</P>
<P>When we came a little farther, we found
the Pa&s;&s;age open, and we came to a very
plea&s;ant Plain, which declined a little gra|dually,
widening to the Left, or <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Side; On
the Right Side of this, we &s;aw another va&s;t
Opening like the fir&s;t, which went in about
Half a Mile, and then clos'd up as the fir&s;t
had done, &s;loping up to the Top of the Hills
a mo&s;t mon&s;trous, inconceivable Height.</P>
<P>My Patron &s;topping here, and getting
down, or alighting from his Mule, gave him
to his Man, and a&s;king me to alight, told
me, This was the fir&s;t Night's Entertainment
I was to meet with in the <HI>Andes,</HI> and hoped
I was prepared for it. I told him, That I
might very well con&s;ent to accept of &s;uch
Entertainment, in a Journey of my own con|triving,
as he was content to take up with
in Compliment to me.</P>
<P>I looked round me, to &s;ee if there were any
Huts or Cots of the Mountaniers thereabouts,
but I perceived none; only I ob&s;erved &s;ome|thing
like a Hou&s;e, and it was really a
Hou&s;e of &s;ome of the &s;aid Mountaniers
upon the Top of a Precipice as high from
where we &s;tood, as the Top of the Cupulo of
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, and I &s;aw &s;ome living Creatures,
whether Men or Women, I could not tell,
looking from thence down upon us: How|ever,
I under&s;tood afterwards, That they had
Ways to come at their Dwelling, which were
very ea&s;y and agreeable, and had Lanes and
<PB N="88" REF="300">
Plains where they &s;ed their Cattle, and had
every thing growing that they de&s;ired.</P>
<P>My Patron making a kind of an Invita|tion
to me to walk, took me up that dark
Cha&s;m, or Opening on the Right Hand,
which I have ju&s;t mentioned; Here, Sir,
&s;aid he, if you will venture to walk a few
Steps, 'tis likely we may &s;hew you &s;ome of
the Product of this Country; but as it grew
towards Night, he added, But I &s;ee if is too
dark; perhaps we may do it in the Morning:
And with this, we walked back towards the
Place where we left our Mules and Servants,
and when we came thither, there was a
complete Camp fixed, Three very hand|&s;ome
Tents rai&s;ed, and a Bar &s;et up at a
Di&s;tance, where the Mules were tyed one to
another to graze, and the Servants, and the
Baggage, lay together with an open Tent
over them.</P>
<P>My Patron led me into the Fir&s;t Tent,
and told me, He was obliged to let me know,
That I mu&s;t make &s;hift with that Lodging,
the Place not affording any better.</P>
<P>Here we had Quilts laid very artificially
and clever, for me and my Three Comerades,
and we lodged very comfortably; but be|fore
we came to that, we had the Third
Tent to go to, in which there was a very
hand&s;ome Table, covered with all Conveni|encies,
and, in a Word, with a cold Treat.
that is to &s;ay, Cold roa&s;ted Mutton and Beef,
very well dre&s;s'd; and after that, &s;ome
Potred or Baked Veni&s;on, with Pickles, Con|&s;erves,
and very fine Sweetmeats.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="301">
Here we eat very freely, but he bid us
depend upon it, That we &s;hould not fare &s;o
well the next Night; and &s;o it would be wor&s;e
every Night, 'till we came to lie intirely
at a <HI>Mountanier</HI>'s; but he was better to us
than he pretended.</P>
<P>In the Morning, we had our Chocolate as
regularly as we u&s;ed to have it in his own
Hou&s;e, and we were up, and ready to tra|vel,
in a Moment. We went winding now
from the <HI>S. E.</HI> to the Left, 'till our Cour&s;e
looked <HI>E.</HI> by <HI>N.</HI> when we came again to have
the River in View. But I &s;hould have ob|&s;erved
here, That my Two Mid&s;hip men,
and Two of my Patron's Servants, had, by
his Direction, been, very early in the Morn|ing,
clambering up the Rocks in the Open|ing
on the Right Hand, and had come back
again about a Quarter of an Hour after we
&s;et out; when, mi&s;&s;ing my Two Men, I en|quired
for them, and my Patron &s;aid, They
were coming; for, it &s;eems, he &s;aw them
at a Di&s;tance, and &s;o we halted for
them.</P>
<P>When they were come almo&s;t up to us, he
call'd to his Men in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> to a&s;k, If they
had had <HI>Una bon Vejo?</HI> They an&s;wer'd, <HI>Poco,
Poco:</HI> And when they came quite up, one of
my Mid&s;hip-Men &s;hew'd me Three or Four
&s;mall Bits of clean perfect Gold, which they
had pick'd up in the Hill or Gullet where the
Water trickled down from the Rocks; and
the <HI>Spaniard</HI> told them, That had they had
Time, they &s;hould have found much more, the
Water being quite down, and no Body having
<PB N="90" REF="302">
been there &s;ince the la&s;t hard Rain. One of
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had Three &s;mall Bits in his
Hand al&s;o; I &s;aid nothing for the pre&s;ent,
but charg'd my Mid&s;hip Men to mark the
Place, and &s;o we went on.</P>
<P>We follow'd up the Stream of this Water
for Three Days more, encamping every Night
as before; in which Time we pa&s;s'd by &s;eve|ral
&s;uch Openings into the Rocks, on either
Side. On the Fourth Day we had the Pro|&s;pect
of a very plea&s;ant Valley and River be|low
us on the <HI>North</HI> Side; keeping its Cour&s;e
almo&s;t in the Middle; the Valley reaching
near Four Miles in Length, and in &s;ome Places
near Two Miles broad.</P>
<P>This Sight was perfectly &s;urprizing, becau&s;e
here we found the Vale fruitful, level, and in|habited,
there being &s;everal &s;mall Villages or
Clu&s;ters of Hou&s;es, &s;uch as the <HI>Chilians</HI> live in,
which are low Hou&s;es, cover'd with a Kind of
Sedge, and &s;helter'd with little Rows of thick
grown Trees, of what Kind we knew not.</P>
<P>We &s;aw no Way thro', nor which Way we
were to go out; but &s;aw it every where
bounded with prodigious Mountains, look to
which Side of the Valley we would: We kept
&s;till on the Right, which was now the <HI>South-Ea&s;t
Side</HI> of the River, and, as we followed it
up the Stream, it was &s;till le&s;s than at fir&s;t, and
le&s;&s;ened every Step we went, becau&s;e of the
Number of Rills we left behind us: And
here we encamped the Fifth Time, and
all this while the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentleman victu|aelled
us: 'Then we turned again to the
Right, where we had a new and beau|tiful
<PB N="91" REF="303">
Pro&s;pect of another Valley, as broad as
the other, but not above a Mile in length.</P>
<P>After we were thro' this Valley, my Pa|tron
rides up to a poor little Cottage of a
<HI>Chilian Indian,</HI> without any Ceremony, and
calling us all about him, told us, That there
we would go to Dinner: We &s;aw a Smoke in|deed
<HI>in</HI> the Hou&s;e, rather than come <HI>out</HI> of
it; and it &s;mother'd thro' a Hole in the
Roof in&s;tead of a Chimney: However to this
Hou&s;e, as to an Inn, my Patron had &s;ent a|way
his <HI>Mayor Domo</HI> and another Servant,
and there, they were as bu&s;y as Two Cooks,
boiling and &s;tewing Goats Fle&s;h, and Fowls,
making us Soup, Broth, and &s;uch Hodge-Podge,
as it &s;eems they were us'd to provide, and
which, however homely the Cottage was, we
found very favoury and good.</P>
<P>Immediately a loo&s;e Tent was pitch'd, and
we had our Table &s;et up, and Dinner &s;erv'd in,
and within about Two Hours, we had eaten it,
repos'd our&s;elves after it (as the Cu&s;tom there
is) and were ready to travel again.</P>
<P>I had Room all this while to ob&s;erve, and
wonder at the admirable Structure of this Place,
which may &s;erve, in my Opinion, for the
Eighth Wonder of the World; that is to &s;ay,
&s;uppo&s;ing there were but Seven before. We
had in the Middle of the Day, indeed, a very
hot Sun, and the Reflection from the Moun|tains
made it &s;till hotter; but the Heighth of
the Rocks on every Side began to ca&s;t long
Shadows before Three a Clock, except
where the Openings look'd toward the We&s;t,
and as &s;oon as tho&s;e Shadows reach'd us,
<PB N="92" REF="304">
the cool Breezes of the Air came naturally on
drawing every Way exceeding plea&s;ant and
refre&s;hing.</P>
<P>The Place we were in, was green and flou|ri&s;hing,
and the Soil well cultivated by the
poor indu&s;trious <HI>Chilians,</HI> who liv'd here in
perfect Solitude, and pleas'd with their Liberty
from the Tyranny of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who very
&s;eldom vi&s;ited them, and never mole&s;ted them,
being pretty much out of their Way, except
when they came for Hunting and Diver&s;ion;
and then they u&s;ed the <HI>Chilians</HI> always civilly,
because they were oblig'd to them for their
A&s;&s;i&s;tance in their Diver&s;ions; the <HI>Chilians</HI> of
tho&s;e Valleys being very active, &s;trong, and
nimble Fellows.</P>
<P>By this Means, mo&s;t of them were furni&s;h'd
with Fire-Arms, Powder, and Shot, and were
very good Marks-Men; but as to Violence a|gain&s;t
any Body, they entertained no Thought
of that Kind, as I could perceive, but were
content with their Way of Living, which
was ea&s;y and free.</P>
<P>The Tops of the Mountains here, the Valleys
being &s;o large, were much plainer to be &s;een,
than where the Pa&s;&s;ages were narrow; for
there the Heighth was &s;o great, that we could
&s;ee nothing. Here, at &s;everal Di&s;tances (the
Rocks towring one over another) we might &s;ee
Smoak come out of &s;ome, <HI>Snow</HI> lying upon
others, Trees and Bu&s;hes growing upon
others; and Goats, wild A&s;&s;es, and other
Creatures, which we could hardly di&s;tingui&s;h,
running about on others.</P>

<P><PB N="93" REF="306">
When we had pa&s;s'd thro' this &s;econd Valley,
I perceiv'd we came to a narrower Pa&s;&s;age,
and &s;omething like the fir&s;t; the Entrance into
it indeed was &s;mooth, and above a Quarter of
a Mile broad, and it went winding away to
the <HI>North,</HI> and then again turn'd round to the
<HI>N. E.</HI> afterwards almo&s;t due <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and then to
the <HI>S. E.</HI> and &s;o to <HI>S. S. E.</HI> and this frightful
narrow Straight, with the hanging Rocks almo&s;t
clo&s;ing together on the Top, who&s;e Heighth
we could neither &s;ee or gue&s;s at, continued about
Three Days Journey more, mo&s;t of the Way a&s;|cending
gently upwards: And as to the River,
it was by this Time quite lo&s;t; but we might
&s;ee, that on any Occa&s;ion of Rain, or of the
melting of the Snow on the Mountains, there
was a Hollow in the Middle of the Valley,
thro' which the Water made its Way, and on
either hand the Sides of the Hills were full of
the like Gullies, made by the Violence of the
Rain, where, not the Earth only, but the
Rocks them&s;elves, even the very Stone, &s;eem'd
to be worn and penetrated by the continual
Fall of the Water.</P>
<P>Here my Patron &s;hew'd me, that in the
Hollow, which I mention'd, in the Middle of
this Way, and at the Bottom of tho&s;e Gullies,
or Places worn, as above, in the Rocks, there
were often found Pieces of Gold, and &s;ome|times,
after a Rain, very great Quantities;
and that there were few of the little <HI>Chilian</HI>
Cottages, which I had &s;een, where they had
not &s;ometimes a Pound or Two of Gold Du&s;t,
and Lumps of Gold by them; and he was
mi&s;taken, if I was willing to tarry, and make
<PB N="94" REF="307">
the Experiment, if we did not find &s;ome
even then, in a very little Search.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chilian</HI> Mountainier, at who&s;e Hou&s;e
we had &s;topp'd, to dine, had gone with us, and he
hearing my Patron &s;ay thus, runs pre&s;ently to
the hollow Channel in the Middle; there was
a Kind of a Fall, or Break in it, where the
Water by falling, perhaps, Two or Three
Foot, had made a little Place deeper than the
re&s;t; and which, tho' there was no Water
then running, yet had Water in it, perhaps
the Quantity of a Barrel or Two: Here, with
the Help of Two of the Servants, and a Kind
of Scoop, he pre&s;ently threw out the Water,
with the Sand, and whatever was at Bottom
among it, into the ordinary Water-Cour&s;e; the
Water &s;alling thus hard, every Scoop-full
upon the Sand or Earth that came out of the
Scoop before it, wa&s;h'd a great deal of it
away; and among that which remain'd, we
might plainly &s;ee little Lumps of Gold
&s;hining as big as Grains of Sand, and &s;ome|times
One or Two a little bigger.</P>
<P>This was Demon&s;tration enough to us; I
took up &s;ome &s;mall Grains of it, about the
Quantity of Half a Quarter of an Ounce, and
left my Mid&s;hip-Men to take up more, and
they &s;taid indeed &s;o long, that they could
&s;carce &s;ee their Way to overtake us, and brought
away about Two Ounces in all, the <HI>Chilian</HI>
and the Servants very freely giving them all
they found.</P>
<P>When we had travell'd about Nine Miles
more in this winding frightful narrow
Way, it began to grow towards Night, and
<PB N="95" REF="308">
my Patron talk'd of taking up our Quarters
as we had before; but his Gentleman put him
in Mind of a <HI>Chilian,</HI> one of their Old Ser|vants,
who lived in a Turning among the
Mountains, about Half a Mile out of our
Way, and where we might be accommodated
again with the Helps of a Hou&s;e, and Place,
at lea&s;t, for our Cookery: Very true, &s;ays
our Patron, We will go thither, and there,
Seignior, &s;ays he, turning to me, You &s;hall
&s;ee an Emblem of complete Felicity, even in
the Middle of this Place of Horror; and you
&s;hall &s;ee a Prince greater, and more truly &s;o,
than King <HI>Philip,</HI> who is the greate&s;t Man in
the World.</P>
<P>Accordingly we went &s;oftly on, his Gen|tleman
having advanced before, and, in about
Half a Mile, we found a Turning or Open|ing
on our Left, where we beheld a deep,
large Valley, almo&s;t Circular, and of about
a Mile Diameter, and abundance of Hou&s;es,
or Cottages, inter&s;pers'd all over it, &s;o that
the whole Valley looked like an inhabited
Village, and the Ground, like a planted
Garden.</P>
<P>We, who, as I &s;aid, had been for &s;ome
Miles a&s;cending upwards, were &s;o high above
them, that the low Valley looked, as the
Low Lands in <HI>England</HI> look below <HI>Box-Hill,</HI>
in <HI>Surrey;</HI> and I began to a&s;k, How we &s;hould
get down? But as we were come into a
wider Space than before, &s;o we had more
Day-light; for though the Hollow Way had
rendred it near du&s;k before, now it was almo&s;t
clear Day again.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="309">
Here we parted with the Fir&s;t <HI>Chilian</HI> that $
mentioned, and I ordered one of my Mid&s;hip|men
to give him a Hat, and a Piece of Black
Bays, enough to make him a Cloak, which
&s;o obliged the Man, that he knew not what
way to te&s;tify his Joy: But I knew what I
was doing in this; and I ordered my Mid|&s;hip-man
to do it, that he might make his
Acquaintance with him again&s;t another Time,
and it was not a Gift ill-be&s;towed, as will
appear in its Place.</P>
<P>We were now obliged to quit our Mules,
who all took up their Quarters at the Top of
the Hill, while we, by Footings made in the
Rocks, de&s;cended, as we might &s;ay, down a
Pair of Stairs of Half a Mile long, but with
many plain Places between, like Foot-paces,
for the Ea&s;e of going and coming.</P>
<P>Thus winding and turning, to avoid the
Declivity of the Hill, we came very &s;afe
to the Bottom, where my Patron's Gentle|man,
and our New Landlord, <HI>that was to
be,</HI> came to pay his Compliment to us.</P>
<P>He was dre&s;&s;ed in a Jerkin made of an Ot|ter
Skin, like a Doublet, a Pair of long <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
Breeches of Leather, dre&s;s'd after the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion, Green, and very &s;oft, and
which looked very well, but what the Skin
was, I could not gue&s;s; he had over it a
Mantle, of a kind of Cotton, dyed in Two
or Three grave Brown Colours, and thrown
about him like a <HI>Scot&s;man</HI>'s Plaid; he
had Shoes of a particular Make, tied on
like Sandals, flat-heeled, no Stockings, his
Breeches hanging down below the Calf of his
<PB N="97" REF="310">
Leg, and his Shoes lacing up above his
Ancles; he had on a Cap of the Skin of &s;ome
&s;mall Bea&s;t like a <HI>Racoon,</HI> with a bit of the
Tail hanging out from the Crown of his
Head backward, a long Pole in his Hand;
and a Servant, as oddly dre&s;s'd as him&s;elf,
carried his Gun; he had neither Spado nor
Dagger.</P>
<P>When our Patron came up, the <HI>Chilian</HI>
&s;tepped forward, and made him Three very
low Bows, and then they talked together,
not in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> but in a kind of <HI>Mountain
Jargon,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Spani&s;,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Chilian,</HI> of
which I &s;carce under&s;tood one Word: After
a few Words, I under&s;tood he &s;aid &s;omething
of a Stranger come to &s;ee, <HI>and then, I &s;uppo&s;e,
added,</HI> the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Mountains; then
the <HI>Chilian</HI> came towards me, made me
Three Bows, and bad me welcome in <HI>Spani&s;h:</HI>
As &s;oon as he had &s;aid that, he turns to his
<HI>Barbarian, I mean, His Servant, for he was
as ugly a look'd Fellow as ever I &s;aw,</HI> and tak|ing
his Gun from him, pre&s;ented it to me,
my Patron bad me take it, <HI>for he &s;aw me a
little at a Lo&s;s what to do,</HI> telling me, That
as it was the greate&s;t Compliment that a
<HI>Chilian</HI> could pay to me, he would be ve|ry
ill plea&s;ed, and out of Humour, if it was
not accepted, and would think we did not
care to be friendly with him.</P>
<P>As we had given this <HI>Chilian</HI> no Notice of
our coming, no, not a Quarter of an Hour,
we could not expect great Matters of Entertain|ment,
and, as we carried our Provi&s;ion with
<PB N="98" REF="311">
us, we did not &s;tand in much need of it; but
we had no Rea&s;on to complain.</P>
<P>This Man's Habitation was all the &s;ame
as the re&s;t; low, and covered with a Sedge,
or a kind of Reed, which we found grew
very plentifully in the Valley where he liv'd;
he had &s;everal Pieces of Ground round his
Dwelling, inclo&s;ed with Stone Walls, made
very artificially with &s;mall Stones, and no
Mortar; the&s;e inclo&s;ed Grounds were planted
with &s;everal kinds of Garden-&s;tuff for his
Hou&s;ehold, &s;uch as Plantains, <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ca|bages,
Green Cocoa, and other Things of the
Growth of their own Country, and Two of
them with <HI>European</HI> Wheat.</P>
<P>He had Five or Six Apartments in his Hou&s;e,
every one of them had a Door into the Air,
and into one another, and Two of them were
very large and decent, had long Tables on
one Side made after their own Way, and
Benches to fit to them like our Country Peo|ples
long Tables in <HI>England,</HI> and Mattre&s;&s;es
like Couches all along the other Side, with
Skins of &s;everal Sorts of wild Creatures laid
on them to repo&s;e on in the Heat of the Day,
as is the U&s;age among the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Our People &s;et up their Tents and Beds abroad
as before; but my Patron told me, The <HI>Chi|lian</HI>
would take it very ill, if he and I did not
take up our Lodging in his Hou&s;e, and we
had Two Rooms provided, very magnificent
in their Way. The Mattre&s;s we lay on,
had a large Canopy over if, &s;pread like the
Crown of a Tent, and covered with a large
Piece of Cotton, white as Milk, and which
<PB N="99" REF="312">
came round every way like a Curtain; &s;o
that, if it had been in the Open Field, it
would have been a complete Covering; the
Bed, &s;uch as it was, might be as hard as a
Quilt, and not more, and the Covering was
of the &s;ame Cotton as the Curtain-work,
which, it &s;eems, is the Manufacture of the
<HI>Chilian</HI> Women, and is made very dextrou&s;ly;
it looked wild, but was plea&s;ant enough, and
proper to the Place; &s;o I &s;lept very com|fortably
in it.</P>
<P>But, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I was &s;urprized at
the A&s;pect of Things in the Night here.
It was, as I told you above, near Night
when we came to this Man's Cottage (Palace
I &s;hould have called it) and while we were
taking our Repa&s;t, which was very pretty,
it grew quite Night; we had Wax Can|dles
brought in for Light, which, it &s;eems,
my Patron's Man had provided; and the
Place had &s;o little Communication with the
Air by Windows, that we &s;aw nothing of
what was without Doors.</P>
<P>After Supper, my Patron turns to me,
Come, Seignior, &s;aid he, pray prepare your|&s;elf
to take a Walk: What, in the Dark, &s;aid
I, in &s;uch a Country as this? No, no, &s;ays
he, It is never dark here, you are now come
to the Country of Everla&s;ting Day; What
think you? Is not this <HI>Eli&s;ium?</HI> I do not
under&s;tand you, &s;ays I; But you will pre|&s;ently,
&s;ays he, when I &s;hall &s;hew you, that
'tis now lighter Abroad, than when we came
in. Soon after this, &s;ome of the Servants
opened the Door that went into the next
<PB N="100" REF="313">
Room, and the Door of that Room, which
opened into the Air, &s;tood open, from whence
a Light of Fire &s;hone into the outer Room,
and &s;o farther into ours: What are they
burning there, &s;ays I to my Patron? You
will &s;ee pre&s;ently, &s;ays he; adding, I hope
you will not be &s;urprized; &s;o he led me out
to that Door.</P>
<P>But who can expre&s;s the Thoughts of a
Man's Heart, coming on a &s;udden into a Place
where the whole World &s;eemed to be of a
light Fire, the Valley was on one Side &s;o ex|ceeding
bright, the Eye could &s;carce bear to
look at it; the Sides of the Mountains were
&s;hining like the Fire it&s;elf; the Flame from
the Top of the Mountain on the other Side,
ca&s;ting its Light directly upon them, from
thence the Reflection into other Parts look'd
Red, and more terrible; for the fir&s;t was
white and clear, like the Light of the Sun; but
the other being, as it were, a Reflection of Light
mix'd with &s;ome darker Cavities, repre&s;ented
the Fire of a Furnace; and, in &s;hort, it
might well be &s;aid, here was no Darkne&s;s;
But, certainly, at the fir&s;t View it gives no
Traveller any other Idea than that of being
at the very Entrance into Eternal Horror.</P>
<P>All this while there was no Fire, that is
to &s;ay, No real Flame to be &s;een, only, that
where the Flame was, it &s;hone clearly into
the Valley; but the <HI>Volcano,</HI> or <HI>Volcanos,</HI>
from whence the Fire i&s;&s;ued out (for it &s;eems
there were no le&s;s than Three of them, tho'
at the Di&s;tance of &s;ome Miles from one ano|ther)
were on the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Sides of the
<PB N="101" REF="314">
Valley, which was &s;o much on that Side
where we were, that we could &s;ee nothing but
the Light, neither on the other Side, could
they &s;ee any more, it &s;eems, than ju&s;t the
Top of the Flame; nor knowing any thing of
the Places from whence it i&s;&s;ued out, which
no mortal Creature, no, not of the <HI>Chilians</HI>
them&s;elves, were ever hardy enough to go
near; nor would it be po&s;&s;ible if any &s;hould
attempt it, the Tops of the Hills, for many
Leagues about them, being covered with new
Mountains of A&s;hes and Stones, which are
daily ca&s;t out of the Mouths of tho&s;e <HI>Volca|nos,</HI>
by which, they grew every Day higher
than they were before, and which would
overwhelm not only Men, but whole Armies
of Men, if they &s;hould venture to come near
them.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t we came into the long narrow
Way I mentioned la&s;t, I ob&s;erved, That, as
I thought, the Wind blew very hard aloft
among the Hills, and that it made a Noi&s;e
like Thunder, which I thought nothing of,
but as a Thing u&s;ual; But now, when I came
to this terrible Sight, and that I heard the
&s;ame Thunder, and yet found the Air calm
and quiet, I &s;oon under&s;tood, that it was a
continued Thunder, occa&s;ioned by the Roar|ing
of the Fire in the Bowels of the Moun|tains.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome Time, you may &s;uppo&s;e, be|fore
a Traveller, unacquainted with &s;uch
Things, could make them familiar to him;
and though the Horror and Surprize might
abate, after proper Reflections on the Nature
<PB N="102" REF="315">
and Rea&s;on of the Thing, yet I had a kind
of A&s;toni&s;hment upon me for a great while;
every different Place to which I turned
my Eye, pre&s;ented me with a new Scene of
Horror; I was, for a while, frighted at the
Fire being, as it were, over my Head, for I
could &s;ee nothing of it; but that the Air
looked as if it were all on Fire, and I could
not per&s;uade my&s;elf but it would ca&s;t down
the Rocks and Mountains on my Head; But
they laugh'd me out of that Part.</P>
<P>After a while, I a&s;ked them, If the&s;e <HI>Vol|canos</HI>
did not ca&s;t out a kind of Liquid Fire,
as I had &s;een an Account of on the mon&s;trous
Eruptions at Mount <HI>Aetna,</HI> which ca&s;t out
a prodigious Stream of Fire, and ran Eight
Leagues into the Sea? Upon my putting this
Que&s;tion to my Patron, he a&s;ked the <HI>Chilian,</HI>
How long ago it was &s;ince <HI>&s;uch a Stream,</HI>
calling it by a Name of their own, ran Fire?
He an&s;wered, It ran now, and if we were
di&s;po&s;ed to walk but Three Furlongs, we
&s;hould &s;ee it.</P>
<P>He &s;aid little to me, but a&s;ked me, If I
car'd to walk a little way by this kind of
Light? I told him, It was a &s;urprizing Place
we were in, but I &s;uppo&s;ed he would lead me
into no Danger; he &s;aid, He would a&s;&s;ure me
he would lead me into no Danger; That the&s;e
Things were very familiar to them; but that
I might depend there was no Hazard, and
that the Flames which gave all this Light,
were Six or Seven Miles off, and &s;ome of
them more; We walked along the Plain of
(the Valley about Half a Mile, when another
<PB N="103" REF="316">
great Valley opened to the Right, and gave
us a more dreadful Pro&s;pect than any we had
&s;een before; For at the farther End of this
Second Valley, but at the Di&s;tance of about
Three Miles from where we &s;tood, we &s;aw
a livid Stream of Fire come running down
the Sides of the Mountain for near Three
Quarters of a Mile in Length, running like
melted Metal into a Mould, or out of a Fur|nace,
'till, I &s;uppo&s;ed, as it came nearer the
Bottom, it cooled and &s;eparated, and &s;o went
out of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Beyond this, over the Summit of a pro|digious
Mountain, we could &s;ee the Tops of
the clear Flame of a <HI>Volcano,</HI> a dreadful one
no doubt, could we have &s;een it all; and from
the Mouth of which, it was &s;uppo&s;ed this
Stream of Fire came, though the <HI>Chilian</HI> a&s;|&s;ured
us, that the Fire it&s;elf was Eight
Leagues off, and that the Liquid Fire which
we &s;aw, came out of the Side of the Moun|tain,
and was Two Leagues off of the great
<HI>Volcano</HI> it&s;elf, running like Metal out of a
Furnace.</P>
<P>They told me, There was a great deal of
melted Gold ran down with the other in|flamed
Earth in that Stream, and that much
Gold was afterwards found there; but this I
was to take upon Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>This Sight was, as you will ea&s;ily &s;up|po&s;e,
be&s;t at a Di&s;tance, and, indeed, I had
enough of it; as for my Two Mid&s;hip-men,
they were almo&s;t frighted out of all their Re|&s;olutions
of going any farther in this horrible
Place, and when we came back, they came
<PB N="104" REF="317">
mighty &s;eriou&s;ly to me, and begg'd of me
for God's &s;ake, not to venture any farther up|on
the Faith of the&s;e <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for that they
would certainly carry us all into &s;ome Mi&s;|chief
or other, and betray us.</P>
<P>I bid them be ea&s;y, for I &s;aw nothing in it
all, that look'd like Treachery; That it was
true, indeed, it was a terrible Place to look
on, but it &s;eemed to be nothing but what
was natural and familiar there, and we &s;hould
be &s;oon out of it. They told me very &s;eri|ou&s;ly,
That they believed it was the very
Mouth of Hell, and that, in &s;hort, they were
not able to bear it, and begged of me to go
back: I told them No, I could not think of
going back; but if they could not endure it,
I would give Con&s;ent that they &s;hould go
back in the Morning: However, we went, for
the pre&s;ent, to the <HI>Chilian</HI>'s Hou&s;e again, where
we got a plentiful Draught of <HI>Chilian</HI> Wine,
for my Patron had taken care to have a good
Quantity of it with us, and in the Morning
my Two Mid&s;hip-men, who got very drunk
over Night, had Courage enough to venture
forward again; for the Light of the Sun put
quite another Face upon Things, and nothing
of the Fire was then to be &s;een, only the
Smoke.</P>
<P>All our Company lodged in the Tents here,
but I and any Patron the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who lodged
within the <HI>Chilian</HI>'s Hou&s;e, as I told you.
This <HI>Chilian</HI> was a great Man among the Na|tives,
and all the Valley I &s;poke of, which
lay round his Dwelling, was called his own;
he lived in a State of perfect Tranquility,
<PB N="105" REF="318">
neither enjoying nor coveting any thing but
what was nece&s;&s;ary, and wanting nothing
that was &s;o; he had Gold, as it might be
&s;aid, for picking it up off of the Dunghil,
for it was found in all the little Gullies and
Rills of Water, which, as I have &s;aid, come
down from the Mountains on every Side; yet
I did not find, that he troubled him&s;elf to
lay up any great Quantity more than &s;erv'd
to go to <HI>Villa Rica,</HI> and buy what he wanted
for him&s;elf and Family; he had, it &s;eems, a
Wife, and &s;ome Daughters, but no Sons;
the&s;e lived in a &s;eparate Hou&s;e, about a Fur|long
from this where he lived, and were
kept there as a Family by them&s;elves, and
if he had had any Sons, they would have
lived with him.</P>
<P>He did not offer to go with us any part of
our Way, as the other had done; but, having
entertained us with great Civility, took his
Leave. I cau&s;ed one of my Mid&s;hip-men
to make him a Pre&s;ent, when we came away,
of a Piece of Black Bays, enough to make
him a Cloak, as I did the other, and a Piece
of Blue <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Serge, enough to make him
a Jerkin and Breeches, which he accepted as
a great Bounty.</P>
<P>We &s;et out again, though not very early
in the Morning, having, as I &s;aid, &s;at up
late, and drank freely, over Night, and we
found, that after we had been gone to &s;leep,
it had rained very hard, and though the Rain
was over before we went out, yet the falling
of the Water from the Hills, made &s;uch a
confu&s;ed Noi&s;e, and was eccho'd &s;o backward
<PB N="106" REF="319">
and forward from all Sides, that it was like
a &s;trange Mixture of di&s;tant Thunder, and
though we knew the Cau&s;es, yet it could not
but be &s;urprizing to us for a while.</P>
<P>However, we &s;et forward, the Way under
Foot being pretty good; and fir&s;t we went up
the Steps again, by which we had come down
(our la&s;t Ho&s;t waiting on us thither) and
there I gave him back his Gun, for he would
not take it before.</P>
<P>In this Valley, which was the plea&s;ante&s;t
by Day, and the mo&s;t di&s;mal by Night, that
ever I &s;aw, I ob&s;erved abundance of Goats,
as well tame in the Inclo&s;ures, as wild upon
the Rocks; and we found afterwards, that
the la&s;t were perfectly wild, and to be had,
like tho&s;e at <HI>Juan Fernandes,</HI> by any body
that could catch them; my Patron &s;ent
off Two of his Men, ju&s;t as a Hunt&s;man ca&s;ts
off This Hounds, to go and catch Goats, and
they brought us in Three, which they &s;hot
in le&s;s than Half an Hour, and the&s;e we car|ried
with us for our Evening Supply, for we
made no Dinner this Day, having fed hear|tily
in the Morning about Nine, and had
Chocolate Two Hours before that.</P>
<P>We travelled now along the narrow, wind|ing
Pa&s;&s;age, which I mentioned before, for
about Four Hours, 'till I found, that though
we had a&s;cended but gently, yet, that, as we
had done &s;o for almo&s;t Twenty Miles toge|ther,
we were got up to a frightful Height, and
I began to expect &s;ome very difficult De&s;cent
on the other Side; But we were made ea&s;y
about Two a Clock, when the Way not only
<PB N="107" REF="320">
declined again to the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> but grew wider,
though with frequent Turnings and Winding
about, &s;o that we could &s;eldom &s;ee above
Half a Mile before us: We went on thus pret|ty
much upon a Level, now ri&s;ing, now fall|ing;
but &s;till I found that we were a very
great Height from our fir&s;t Entrance, and as
to the running of the Water, I found that it
flow'd neither <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> nor <HI>We&s;t,</HI> but run all down
the little Turnings that we frequently met
with on the <HI>North</HI> Side of our Way, which,
my Patron told me, went all into the great
Valley where we &s;aw the Fire, and &s;o went
away by a general Channel <HI>North We&s;t</HI> 'till
it found its Way out into the open Country
of <HI>Chili,</HI> and &s;o to the <HI>South-Seas.</HI></P>
<P>We were now come to another Night's
Lodging, which we were obliged to take up
with on the green Gra&s;s, as we did the Fir&s;t
Night; but by the Help of our Proveditor-General,
my Patron, we fared very well, our
Goats-Fle&s;h being reduced into &s;o many
Sorts of Veni&s;on, that none of us could di|&s;tingui&s;h
it from the be&s;t Veni&s;on we ever
ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>Here we &s;lept without any of the frightful
Things we &s;aw the Night before, except, that
we might &s;ee the Light of the Fire in the Air,
at a great Di&s;tance, like a great City on Fire,
but that gave us no Di&s;turbance at all.</P>
<P>In the Morning our Two Hunters &s;hot a
Deer, or rather a young Fawn, before we
were awake, and this was the fir&s;t we met
with in this Part of our Travel, and thus
we were provided for Dinner even before
<PB N="108" REF="321">
Breakfa&s;t-time; as for our Breakfa&s;t, it was
always a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Breakfa&s;t, that is to &s;ay,
About a Pint of Chocolate.</P>
<P>We &s;et out very merrily in the Morning,
and we that were <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> could not refrain
&s;miling at one another, to think how we
pa&s;s'd through a Country where the Gold lay
in every Ditch, as we might call it, and ne|ver
troubled our&s;elves &s;o much as to &s;toop to
take it up; &s;o certain is it, that 'tis ea&s;y to
be placed in a Station of Life, where that
very Gold (the heaping up of which, is here
made the main Bu&s;ine&s;s of Man's living in the
World) would be of no Value, and not worth
taking off from the Ground; nay, not of Sig|nification
enough to make a Pre&s;ent of, for
that was the Ca&s;e here. Two or Three Yards
of <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> Bays, a coar&s;e Rug-like Manu|facture,
worth in <HI>London,</HI> about Fifteen-Pence
Half-penny <HI>per</HI> Yard, was here a Pre|&s;ent
for a Man of Quality, when for a Hand|ful
of Gold-Du&s;t, the &s;ame Per&s;on would
&s;carce &s;ay, Thank-you; or, perhaps, would
think him&s;elf not kindly treated to have it
offered him.</P>
<P>We travelled this Day pretty &s;martly,
having re&s;ted at Noon about Two Hours, as
before, and, by my Calculation, went about
Twenty-two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles in all; about
Five a Clock in the Afternoon, we came in|to
a broad, plain, open Place, where, though
it was not properly a Valley, yet we found
it lay very level for a good way together.
Our Way lying almo&s;t E. S. E. after we had
$arched &s;o about Two Miles, I found the Way
<PB N="109" REF="322">
go evidently down Hill, and in Half a Mile
more, to our &s;ingular Satisfaction, we found,
the Water from the Mountains ran plainly
<HI>Ea&s;tward,</HI> and, con&s;equently, to the <HI>North
Sea.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;aw, at a Di&s;tance, &s;everal Huts, or
Hou&s;es of the <HI>Mountanier</HI> Inhabitants, but
we came near none of them, but kept on our
Way, going down Two or Three pretty &s;teep
Places, not at all dangerous, though &s;ome|thing
difficult.</P>
<P>We encamped again the next Night, as
before, and &s;till our good Caterer had Plenty
of Food for us; But I ob&s;erved, That the
next Morning, when we &s;et forward, our
Tents were left &s;tanding, the Baggage-Mules
tied together to graze, and our Company
le&s;&s;ned by all my Patrons Servants, which,
when I enquired about, he told me, He hoped
we &s;hould have good Quarters quickly
without them. I did not under&s;tand him for
the pre&s;ent, but it unriddled it&s;elf &s;oon after;
for though we travelled Four Days more in
that Narrow Way, yet he always found us
Lodging at the Cottages of the Mountaniers.
The Sixth Day we went all Day up Hill; at
la&s;t, on a &s;udden, the Way turn'd &s;hort <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI>
and opened into a va&s;t wide Country, bound|le&s;s
to the Eye every way, and delivered
us intirely from the Mountains of the <HI>Andes,</HI>
in which we had wandred &s;o long.</P>
<P>Any one may gue&s;s what an agreeable Sur|prize
this was to us, to whom it was the main
End of our Travels. We made no Que&s;tion
that this was the open Country extended to
<PB N="110" REF="323">
the <HI>North,</HI> or <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, but how far
it was thither, or what Inhabitants it was
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by, what Travelling, what Provi|&s;ions
to be found by the Way, what Rivers
to pa&s;s, and whether any navigable or not;
this our Patron him&s;elf could not tell us one
Word of; owning frankly to us, That he had
never been one Step farther than the Place
where we then &s;tood; and that he had been
there only once to &s;atisfy his Curio&s;ity, as I
did now.</P>
<P>I told him, That if I had lived where he did,
and had had Servants and Provi&s;ions at Com|mand,
as he had, at would have been Impo&s;&s;i|ble
for me to have re&s;trained my Curio&s;ity
&s;o far, as not to have &s;earch'd through that
whole Country to the Sea-Side long ago: I told
him, it &s;eemed to be a plea&s;ant and
fruitful Soil, and, no doubt, was capable of
Cultivations and Improvements; and if it
had been only to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a Coun|try
in his <HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ty's Name, it mu&s;t
nave heen worth while to undertake the Di&s;|covery
for the Honour of <HI>Spain;</HI> and that
there could be no Room to que&s;tion, but his
<HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ty would have honoured him
that &s;hould have undertaken &s;uch a Thing,
with &s;ome particular Mark of his Favour,
which might be of Con&s;equence to him and
his Family.</P>
<P>He told me, That as to that, the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
&s;eemed already to have more Dominions in
<HI>America,</HI> than they could keep, and much
more than they were able to reap the Benefit
of, and &s;till more infinitely than they could
<PB N="111" REF="324">
improve, and e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Parts called
<HI>South America.</HI></P>
<P>That it was next to miraculous, that they
could keep the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion where they were,
and were not the <HI>Natives</HI> &s;o utterly de&s;titute
of Support from any other Part of the World,
as not to be able to have either Arms or
Ammunition put into their Hands, it would
be impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ince, I might ea&s;ily &s;ee, they
were Men that wanted not Strength of Body,
or Courage; and it was evident, they did
not want Numbers, &s;eeing they were already
Ten thou&s;and <HI>Natives</HI> to one <HI>Spaniard,</HI> taking
the whole Country from one End to the other.</P>
<P>He went on, Then you &s;ee, Seignior, &s;ays
he, how far we are from Improvement in
that Part of the Country which we po&s;&s;e&s;s,
and many more which, you may be &s;ure, are
among the&s;e va&s;t Mountains, and which we ne|ver
di&s;covered, &s;eeing all the&s;e Valleys and
Pa&s;&s;ages among the Mountains, where Gold
is to be had in &s;uch Quantities, and with &s;o
much Ea&s;e, that every poor <HI>Chilian</HI> gathers
it up with his Hands, and may have as much
as he plea&s;es, are all left open, naked, and
unregarded, in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the wild
Mountaniers, who are Heathens and Savages;
and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> you &s;ee, &s;ays he, are &s;o
few, and the&s;e few &s;o indolent, &s;o &s;lothful,
and &s;o &s;atisfied with the Gold they get of
the <HI>Chilians</HI> for Things of &s;mall Value in
Trade, that all this va&s;t Trea&s;ure lies unre|garded
by them. Nay, adds he, Is it not
very odd to ob&s;erve, That when for our
Diver&s;ion we come out into the Hills,
<PB N="112" REF="325">
and among the&s;e Places where you &s;ee the
Gold is &s;o ea&s;ily found, we come, as we call
it, a Hunting, and divert our&s;elves more
with &s;hooting wild Parrots, or a Fawn or
two, for which al&s;o, we ride, and
run, and make our Servants weary them&s;elves more
than they would in fi&s;hing up the Gold among
the Gullies and Holes that the Water makes
in the Rocks, and more than would &s;uffice to
find Fifty, nay, One hundred times the Va|lue
in Gold?</P>
<P>To what Purpo&s;e then &s;hould we &s;eek the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more Countries, who are already
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of more Land than we can improve,
and of more Wealth than we know what
to do with? Perceiving me very attentive, he
went on thus.</P>
<P>Were the&s;e Mountains, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> valued in
<HI>Europe,</HI> according to the Riches to be found
in them, the Viceroy would obtain Orders
from the King, to have &s;trong Forts erected at
the Entrance in, and at the Coming out of
them, as well on the Side of <HI>Chili,</HI> as here; and
&s;trong Garri&s;ons maintained in them, to pre|vent
foreign Nations la$ding, either on our
Side in <HI>Chili,</HI> or on this Side in the <HI>North</HI>
Seas, and taking the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion from us; he
would then order Thirty thou&s;and Slaves,
Negroes, or <HI>Chilians,</HI> to be con&s;tantly em|ployed,
not only in picking up what Gold
might be found in the Channels of the Water,
which might ea&s;ily be formed into proper
Receivers, &s;o as that it any Gold wa&s;hed from
the Rocks, it &s;hould &s;oon be found, and be
&s;o &s;ecured, as that none of it would e&s;cape;
<PB N="113" REF="326">
al&s;o others, with Miners and Engineers, might
&s;earch into the very Rocks them&s;elves, and
would, no doubt, find out &s;uch Mines of
Gold, or other &s;ecret Stores of it in tho&s;e
Mountains, as would be &s;ufficient to inrich
the World.</P>
<P>While we omit &s;uch Things as the&s;e, Se|ignior,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> what &s;ignifies <HI>Spain</HI> making
new Acqui&s;itions, or the People of <HI>Spain</HI>
&s;eeking new Countries? This va&s;t Tract of
Land you &s;ee here, and &s;ome Hundreds of
Miles every Way, which your Eye cannot
reach to, is a fruitful, plea&s;ant, and agree|able
Piece of God's Creation; but perfectly
uncultivated, and mo&s;t of it uninhabited;
and any Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> that thinks fit to
&s;ettle in it, are free to do &s;o, for any thing
we are able to do to prevent them.</P>
<P>But, Seignior, &s;aid I, does not his <HI>Catho|lick</HI>
Maje&s;ty claim a Title to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
it? And have the <HI>Spaniards</HI> no Governor over
it? nor any Ports or Towns, Settlements or
Colonies in it, as is the Ca&s;e here in <HI>Chili?</HI>
Seignior, replies he, The King of <HI>Spain</HI> is
Lord of all <HI>America;</HI> as well that which he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, as that which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not; that
Right being given him by the Pope, in the
Right of his being a Chri&s;tian Prince, mak|ing
new Di&s;coveries for propagating the Chri|&s;tian
Faith among In$idels. How far that
may pa&s;s for a Title among the <HI>European</HI>
Powers, I know not. I have heard, that it
has always pa&s;&s;ed for a Maxim in <HI>Europe,</HI>
that no Country, which is not planted by
any Prince or People, can be &s;aid to belong
<PB N="114" REF="327">
to them; and, indeed, I cannot &s;ay, but it
&s;eems to be rational, that no Prince &s;hould
pretend to any Title to a Country where he
does not think fit to Plant, and to keep Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion;
for if he leaves the Country unpo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed,
he leaves it free for any other Nation
to come and po&s;&s;e&s;s; and this is the Rea&s;on
why the former King of <HI>Spain</HI> did not di|&s;pute
that Right of the <HI>French,</HI> to their Colo|nies
of <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi</HI> and <HI>Canada;</HI> or the Right of
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to the <HI>Carribee</HI> I&s;lands, or to their
Colonies of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner from the <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> in
the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> which lies that Way,
&s;ays he (pointing <HI>N. E.</HI>) to the <HI>Fretum Magel|lanicum,</HI>
which lies that Way (pointing
<HI>S. E.</HI>) which comprehends a va&s;t Number of
Leagues, is called by us, <HI>Coa&s;ta De&s;erta,</HI> be|ing
unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>Spain,</HI> and di&s;regarded of
all our Nation: Neither is there one <HI>Spaniard</HI>
in it; neverthele&s;s, you &s;ee how fruitful, how
plea&s;ant, and how agreeable a Climate it is;
how apt for Planting and Peopling it &s;eems
to be; and, above all, what a Place of Wealth
here would be behind them, &s;ufficient, and
more than enough, both for them and us;
for we &s;hould have no Rea&s;on to offer them
any Di&s;turbance; neither &s;hould we be in any
Condition to do it, the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Moun|tains
being but few and difficult, as you have
&s;een, and our Numbers not &s;ufficient to do
any thing more than to block them up, to
keep &s;uch People from breaking in upon our
Settlements on the Coa&s;t of the <HI>South-Seas.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="328">
I a&s;ked him, If the&s;e Notions of his were
Common among tho&s;e of his Country, who
were &s;ettled in <HI>Chili</HI> and <HI>Peru?</HI> Or, Whether
they were his own Private Opinions only?
I told him, I believed, the latter, becau&s;e I
found he acted in all his Affairs upon gene|rous
Principles, and was for propagating the
Good of Mankind; but that I que&s;tioned
whether their Governor of <HI>Old-Spain,</HI> or the
Sub-Governor and Viceroy of <HI>New-Spain,</HI>
acted upon tho&s;e Notions or no; and &s;ince he
had mentioned the <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and the Rio
de la Plata, I &s;hould take that as an Exam|ple,
&s;eeing the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would never &s;uffer
any Nation to &s;et Foot in that great River,
where &s;o many Countries might have been
di&s;covered, and Colonies planted; though at
the &s;ame Time, they had not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or
fully di&s;covered tho&s;e Places them&s;elves.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered me, &s;miling, Seignior, &s;ays
he, You have given the Rea&s;on for this your|&s;elf
in that very Part which you think is a
Rea&s;on again&s;t it. We have a Colony at
<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and at the City of <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI>
higher up in the Rio de la Plata; and we are
not willing to let any other Nation &s;ettle
there, becau&s;e we would not let them &s;ee how
weak we are, and what a va&s;t Extent of
Land we po&s;&s;e&s;s there with a few Men: And
this for Two Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> We are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Country, and
daily increa&s;ing there, and may, in Time,
extend our&s;elves farther. The great Rivers
<HI>Parana,</HI> and <HI>Paraguay,</HI> being yet left for us
to plant in, and we are nut willing to put
<PB N="116" REF="329">
our&s;elves out of a Capacity of planting far|ther,
and therefore we keep the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We have a Communication from
thence with <HI>Peru.</HI> That great River <HI>La Plata</HI>
ri&s;es at the City <HI>La Plata,</HI> and out of
the Mountain <HI>Poto&s;i</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> and a great
Trade is carried on by that River; and
it would be dangerous to let Foreigners
into the Secret of that Trade, which they
might intirely cut off; e&s;pecially when they
&s;hould find that &s;mall Number of <HI>Spaniards</HI>
which are planted there to pre&s;erve it, &s;eeing
there are not Six hundred <HI>Spaniards</HI> in all
that va&s;t Country, which, by the Cour&s;e of
that River, is more than One thou&s;and Six
hundred Miles in Length.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, &s;aid I, the&s;e are ju&s;t Grounds for
your keeping the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that River.
They are &s;o, &s;aid he, and the more, becau&s;e
of &s;o powerful a Colony as the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
have in the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> which bound immediately
upon it, and who are always incroaching
upon it from the Land Side, and would glad|ly
have a Pa&s;&s;age up the <HI>Rio Parana</HI> to the
Back of their Colony.</P>
<P>But here, Seignior, &s;ays he, the Ca&s;e dif|fers;
For we neither take nor keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
here; neither have we one <HI>Spaniard,</HI> as I &s;aid,
in the whole Country now before you; and
therefore we call this Country <HI>Coa&s;ta De&s;erta;</HI>
not that it is a De&s;art, as that Name is gene|rally
taken to &s;ignify a barren, &s;andy, dry
Country; on the contrary. The infinite, prodi|gious
Encrea&s;e of the <HI>European</HI> black Cattle,
which were brought by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to the

<HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and let run loo&s;e, is a &s;uffici|ent
Te&s;timony of the Fruitfulne&s;s and Rich|ne&s;s
of the Soil, their Number being &s;uch,
that they kill above Twenty thou&s;and of them
in a Year, for nothing but the Hides, which
they carry away to <HI>Spain,</HI> leaving the Fle&s;h,
though fat and whole&s;ome, to peri&s;h on the
Ground, or be devoured by Birds of Prey.</P>
<P>And the Number is &s;o great, notwith|&s;tanding
all they de&s;troy, that they are found
to wander &s;ometimes in Droves of many
Thou&s;ands together, over all the va&s;t Coun|try
between the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> the City of
<HI>A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> and the <HI>Frontier</HI> of <HI>Peru,</HI> and
even down into this Country which you &s;ee
before us, and up to to the very Foot of
the&s;e Mountains.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid I, and is it not a great Pity,
that all this Part of the Country, and in &s;uch
a Climate as this is, &s;hould lie uncultivated,
or uninhabited rather? for I under&s;tand there
are not any great Numbers of People to be
found among them.</P>
<P>It is true, added he, there are &s;ome Notions of
People &s;pread about in this Country; but as
the Terror of our People, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> drove
them, at fir&s;t, from the Sea Coa&s;t towards
the&s;e Mountains, &s;o the greate&s;t Part of them
continue on this Side &s;till; for towards the
Coa&s;t it is very rare that they find any Peo|ple.</P>
<P>I would have enquired of him about Rivers,
and Navigable Streams, which might be in
this Country; but he told me frankly, That
he could give me no Account of that; only
<PB N="118" REF="331">
thus, That if any of the Rivers went away
towards the <HI>North,</HI> they certainly run all
into the great <HI>Rio de la Plata;</HI> but that if
they went <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> or <HI>Southerly,</HI> they mu&s;t go
directly to the Coa&s;t, which was ordinarily
called, as he &s;aid, <HI>La Coa&s;ta De&s;erta,</HI> or, as
by &s;ome, <HI>The Coa&s;t of</HI> Palagonia; That as to
the Magnitude of tho&s;e Rivers, he could &s;ay
little, but that it could not be rational, but
there mu&s;t be &s;ome very con&s;iderable Rivers,
and who&s;e Streams mu&s;t needs be capable of
Navigation, &s;eeing abundance of Water mu&s;t
continually flow from the Mountains where
we then were; and its being, at lea&s;t, Four
hundred Miles from the Sea Side, tho&s;e &s;mall
Streams mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily joyn together, and
make large Rivers in the plain Country.</P>
<P>I had enough in this Di&s;cour&s;e, fully to
&s;atisfy all my Curio&s;ity, and &s;ufficiently to
heighten my De&s;ire of making the farther
Di&s;coveries which I had in my Thoughts.</P>
<P>We pitch'd bur little Camp here, and &s;et
down to our Repa&s;t y for I found, that tho'
we were to go back to lodge, yet my Patron
had taken care we &s;hould be furni&s;hed &s;uf|ficiently
for Dinner, and have a good Hou&s;e
to eat it in; that is to &s;ay, a Tent, as be|fore.</P>
<P>The Place where we &s;tood, though we had
come down Hill for a great way, yet &s;eemed
very high from the ordinary Surface of the
Country, and gave us, therefore, an exceed|ing
fine Pro&s;pect of it, the Country declining
gradually for near Ten Miles; and we
thought, as well as the Di&s;tance of the Place
<PB N="119" REF="332">
would allow us, we &s;aw a great River, but,
as I learned afterwards, It was rather a great
Lake, than a River, which was &s;upplied by
the &s;maller Rivers, or Rivulets, from the
Mountains, which met there as in a great
Receptacle of Waters, and out of this Lake,
they all i&s;&s;ued again in one River; of which
I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to give a farther Ac|count
hereafter.</P>
<P>While we were at Dinner, I ordered my
Mid&s;hip-men to take their Ob&s;ervations of
every di&s;tant Object, and to look at every
thing with their Gla&s;&s;es; which they did,
and told me of this Lake; but my Patron could
give no Account of it, having never been, as
he &s;aid before, one Step farther that Way,
than where we were. However, my Men
&s;hewed me plainly, that it was a great Lake,
and that there went a large River from it
towards the <HI>E. S. E.</HI> and this was enough
for me, for that Way lay all the Schemes I
had laid.</P>
<P>I took this Opportunity to a&s;k my Mid&s;hip|men
fir&s;t, If they had taken &s;uch Ob&s;ervations
in their Pa&s;&s;age of the Mountains, as that
they were &s;ure they could find their Way
through to this Place again without Guides?
They a&s;&s;ured me they could.</P>
<P>Then I put it to them, Whether they
thought it might not be feazible to travel
over that va&s;t level Country to the <HI>North
Seas?</HI> And to make a &s;ufficient Di&s;covery of
the Country, &s;o as that hereafter <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI>
coming to the Coa&s;t on that Side of the
<HI>North Seas,</HI> might penetrate to the&s;e Golden-Mountains,
<PB N="120" REF="333">
and reap the Benefit of the Trea|&s;ure
without going a prodigious Length about
<HI>Cape Horn,</HI> and the <HI>Terra del Fuego,</HI> which
was always attended with innumerable Dan|gers;
and without breaking through the King|dom
of <HI>Chili,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Settlements,
which, perhaps, we might &s;oon be at Peace
with, and &s;o be &s;hut out that way by our
own Con&s;ents?</P>
<P>One of my Men began to &s;peak of the
Difficulties of &s;uch an Attempt; The Want
of Provi&s;ions, and other Dangers which we
&s;hould be expo&s;ed to on the Way, but the
other, a bold, bri&s;k Fellow, told me, He
made no Que&s;tion, but it might be ea&s;ily
done, and e&s;pecially becau&s;e all the Rivers
they &s;hould meet with would, of cour&s;e, run
along with us, &s;o that we &s;hould be &s;ure to
have the Tide with us, <HI>as he called it;</HI> And at
la&s;t he added, That he would be content to
be one of tho&s;e Men who &s;hould undertake
it, provided he &s;hould be a&s;&s;ured, that the
Ships would not go away, and pretend that
they could not be found, I told him, We
would talk farther about it; That I had &s;uch
a Thing in my Head, and I had a &s;trong In|clination
to undertake it my&s;elf; but that
I could not an&s;wer it to leave the Ships,
which depended &s;o much upon my Care of
the Voyage.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Talk of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of
&s;uch an Undertaking, and the Methods of
performing it, my Second Mid&s;hip man be|gan
to come into it, and to think it was pra|cticable
enough, and added, That though he
<PB N="121" REF="334">
u&s;ed &s;ome Cautions in his fir&s;t hearing Pro|po&s;als,
yet, if he undertook that Enterprize,
I &s;hould find, that he would do as much of
his Duty in it, as another Man; and &s;o he
did at la&s;t, as will appear in its Place.</P>
<P>We were, by this Time, preparing to be
&s;atisfied with our Journey, and my Patron
coming to me, and a&s;king, If I was for re|turning?
I told him, I could not &s;ay how
many Days it would be before I &s;hould &s;ay,
I had enough of that Pro&s;pect; but that I
would return when he plea&s;ed; only I had
one Que&s;tion to a&s;k him, which was, Whe|ther
the Mountains were as full of Gold
on this Side, as they were on the Side of
<HI>Chili?</HI></P>
<P>As to that, <HI>Seignior,</HI> &s;ays he, the be&s;t Way
to be certain, is to make a Tryal, that you
may be &s;ure we do not &s;peak without
Book; &s;o he called his Gentleman, and ano|ther
Servant that was with him, and de&s;ired
me to call my Two Mid&s;hip-men, and &s;peak|ing
&s;omething to his own Servants fir&s;t, in
the Language of the Country, as I &s;uppo&s;e,
he turned to me, and &s;aid, Come, let us &s;it
down and repo&s;e our&s;elves, and let them go
all together, and &s;ee what they can do.</P>
<P>Accordingly they went away, and, as my
Men told me afterwards, they &s;earch'd in
the &s;mall Streams of Water, which they found
running, and in &s;ome larger Gullies or Chan|nels,
where they found little or no Water
running; but where, upon ha&s;ty Rains, great
Shoots of Water had been u&s;ed to run, and
where Water &s;tood &s;till in the Holes and
<PB N="122" REF="335">
Falls, as I have de&s;cribed once before on the
like Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>They had not been gone above an Hour,
when I plainly heard my Two <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI>
Hollow, which I could ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h from
the Voices of any other Nation, and imme|diately
I ran out of the Tent, Captain <HI>Mer|lote</HI>
followed, and I then &s;aw one of my Mid|&s;hip-men
running towards us, &s;o we went to
meet him, and what with hollowing, and
running, he could hardly &s;peak; but reco|vering
his Breath, &s;aid, He came to de&s;ire
me to come to them, if I would &s;ee a Sight
which I never &s;aw in my Life. I was eager
enough to go, &s;o I went with him, and left
Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> to go back to the Tent to
my Patron the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Do|ctor,
who had not &s;o much Share in the Cu|rio&s;ity:
He did &s;o, and they followed fair and
&s;oftly.</P>
<P>When we came to the Place, we &s;aw &s;uch
a Sight, indeed, as I never &s;aw before; for
there they were &s;itting down round a little
Puddle, or Hole, as I might call it, of Water,
where, in the Time of Rain, the Water run|ing
ha&s;tily from in a Piece of the Rock, about
Two Foot higher than the re&s;t, had made a
Pit under it with the Fall like the Tail of a
Mill, only much le&s;s.</P>
<P>Here they took up the Sand, or Gravel,
with their Hands, and every Handful
brought up with it &s;uch a Quantity of Gold,
as was &s;urprizing; for there they &s;at picking
it out ju&s;t as the Boys in <HI>Londom,</HI> that go
with a Broom and a Hat, pick out old Iron,
<PB N="123" REF="336">
Nails, and Pins out of the Channels, and it
lay as thick.</P>
<P>I &s;tood and looked at them a while, and,
it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, it was a plea&s;ant Sight
enough; But reflecting immediately, that
there was no End of this, and that we were
only upon the Enquiry, Come away, &s;ays I,
laughing, to my Men, and do not &s;tand
picking up of Tra&s;h there all Day: Do you
know how far we have to our Lodging?</P>
<P>I can make no gue&s;s what Quantity might
have been found here in Places, which had,
for Hundreds of Years, wa&s;hed Gold from
the Hills, and, perhaps, never had a Man
come to pick any of it up before; But I was
&s;oon &s;atisfied that here was enough, even to
make all the World &s;ay they had enough; and
&s;o I called off my People, and came away.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, the Quantity of Gold which is
thus wa&s;hed down, is not &s;mall, &s;ince my
Men, enquiring afterwards among the <HI>Chi|lians,</HI>
heard them talk of the great Lake of
Water which I mentioned ju&s;t now that we
&s;aw at a Di&s;tance, which they call <HI>The Gol|den-Lake,</HI>
and where was, as they &s;aid, pro|digious
Quantities of it; not that our Men
&s;uppo&s;ed any Gold was there in Mines, or
in the ordinary Soil, but that the Waters
from the Hills, running with very rapid Cur|rents
at certain Times in the rainy Sea&s;ons,
and after the melting of the Snows, had car|ried
the Gold &s;o far as that Lake; and as it
has been &s;o, perhaps, from the Days of the
General Deluge, no People ever applying
them&s;elves to gather the lea&s;t Grain of it up
<PB N="124" REF="337">
again, it might well be increa&s;ed to &s;uch$
Quantity, as might intitle that Water to
the Name of <HI>The Golden-Lake;</HI> and all the
little Streams and Sluices of Water that run
into it, de&s;erved the Name of <HI>Golden-Rivers&punc;</HI>
as much as that of <HI>The Golden-Lake.</HI></P>
<P>But my Bu&s;ine&s;s was to know, If the
Gold was here, not to trouble my&s;elf to pick
it up: My Views lay another way, and my
End was fully an&s;wered; &s;o I came back to
my Patron, and brought all my Men with
me; You live in a Golden Country, <HI>Seig|nior,
&s;ays I,</HI> my Men are &s;tark mad to &s;ee
&s;o much Gold, and no-body to pick it up:
Should the World know what Trea&s;ure you
have here, I would not an&s;wer for it, that
they &s;hould not flock hither in Armies, and
drive you all away. They need not do that,
Seignior, &s;ays he, for here is enough for them,
and for us too.</P>
<P>We now packed up, and began our Return,
but it was not without Regret that I turned
my Back upon this plea&s;ant Country, the
mo&s;t agreeable Place, of its kind, that ever
I was at in all my Life, or ever &s;hall be in
again: A Country rich, plea&s;ant, fruitful,
whole&s;ome, and capable of every thing for
the Life of Man, that the Heart could enter|tain
a Wi&s;h for.</P>
<P>But my pre&s;ent Work was to return; &s;o we
mounted our Mules, and had, in the mean
Time, the Plea&s;ure of contemplating what
we had &s;een, and applying our&s;elves to &s;uch
farther Mea&s;ures as we had concerted among
us. In about Four Hours we returned to our
<PB N="125" REF="338">
Camp, as I called it, and, by the way, we
found, to our no little Pain, that though we
had come down Hill ea&s;ily, and in&s;en&s;ibly
to the Opening, for &s;ome Miles, yet we had
a hard pull up Hill to go back again: How|ever,
we reached to our Tents in good Time,
and made our Fir&s;t Encampment with Plea|&s;ure
enough, for we were very weary with
the Fatigue of a hard Day's Journey.</P>
<P>The next Day we reached our good <HI>Chilian</HI>'s
Man&s;ion Hou&s;e, or Palace, for &s;uch it might
be called, con&s;idering the Place, and con&s;i|dering
the Entertainment; for now he had
&s;ome Time to provide for us, knowing we
would come back again.</P>
<P>He met us with Three Mules, and Two
Servants, about a Mile before we came to the
De&s;cent going down to his Hou&s;e, of which I
took Notice before, and this he did to guide
us a Way round to his Hou&s;e, without going
down tho&s;e unea&s;y Steps; &s;o we came on our
Mules to his Door, that is to &s;ay, On <HI>his</HI>
Mules, for he would have my Patron the <HI>Spa|niard,
to whom, I ob&s;erved, he &s;hewed an ex|traordinary
Re&s;pect,</HI> and Captain <HI>Merlote,</HI>
and my&s;elf, mount his fre&s;h Mules to carry
us to his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When we came thither, I ob&s;erved he want|ed
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of my Patron's Servants for
his Cookery; for though he had provided
abundance of Food, he owned, he knew not
how to prepare it to our Liking; &s;o they
a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, and one of my Mid&s;hipmen pre|tending
to cook too, made them roa&s;t a Piece
of Veni&s;on, and a Piece of a Kid, or young
<PB N="126" REF="339">
Goat, admirable well, and putting no Garlick
or Onions into the Sauce, but their own
Juices, with a little Wine; it plea&s;ed the <HI>Spa|niard</HI>
&s;o well, that my Man pa&s;&s;ed for an
extraordinary Cook, and had the Favour
a&s;ked of him, to dre&s;s &s;ome more after the
&s;ame Manner, when we came back to the
<HI>Spaniard</HI>'s Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We had here &s;everal Sorts of wild Fowl,
which the <HI>Chilian</HI> had &s;hot while we were gone;
but I knew none of them by any of the
Kinds we have in <HI>England,</HI> except &s;ome <HI>Teal.</HI>
However, they were very good.</P>
<P>The Day was very agreeable and plea&s;ant
here; but the Night dreadful, as before, be|ing
all Fire and Flame again, and though
we under&s;tood both what it was, and where,
yet I could not make it familiar to me, for
my Life. The <HI>Chilian</HI> per&s;uaded us to &s;tay
all the next Day, and did his Endeavour to
divert us as much as po&s;&s;ible: My Two
Mid&s;hip-men went out with him a Hunting,
as he called it, that is, a Shooting; but,
tho' he was a Man of Fifty Years of Age, he
would have killed Ten of them at his Sport,
running up the Hills, and leaping from Rock
to Rock like a Boy of Seventeen. At his
Gun he was &s;o &s;ure a Mark&s;man, that he
&s;eldom mi&s;&s;ed any thing he &s;hot at, whether
running, flying, or &s;itting.</P>
<P>They brought home with them &s;everal
Fowls, Two Fawns, and full grown Deer,
and we had nothing but boiling, &s;tewing,
and broiling, all that Evening: In the After|noon,
we walked out to view the Hills, and
<PB N="127" REF="340">
to &s;ee the &s;tupendous Precipices which &s;ur|rounded
us. As for looking for Gold, we
&s;aw the Places where there was enough to be
had; but that was become now &s;o familiar to
us, that we troubled not our&s;elves about it,
as a Thing not much worth while; but our
Two Mid&s;hip-men, I think, got about the
Quantity of Five or Six Ounces a-piece while
we were chatting, or repo&s;ing in the <HI>Chilian</HI>'s
Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Here it was, that I entred into a Confi|dence
with my Patron the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> con|cerning
my Grand De&s;ign. I told him, in
the fir&s;t Place, That my View of the Open
Country beyond the&s;e Hills, and the parti|cular
Account he had given me of it al&s;o,
had rai&s;ed a Curio&s;ity in me, that I could
&s;carce with&s;tand; and that I had thereupon
form'd a De&s;ign, which, if he would further
me with his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I had a very great
Mind to put in Practice, and that, though I
was to peri&s;h in the Attempt.</P>
<P>He told me very readily, Nothing &s;hould
be wanting on his Part to give me any A&s;&s;i|&s;tance
he could, either by him&s;elf, or any of
his Servants; but, &s;miling, and with abun|dance
of good Humour, <HI>Seignior, &s;ays he,</HI> I
believe I gue&s;s at the De&s;ign you &s;peak of;
you are fired now with a De&s;ire to traver&s;e
this great Country to the <HI>Coa&s;ta De&s;erta,</HI> and
the <HI>North-S$as;</HI> That is a very great Under|taking,
and you will be well advi&s;ed before
you undertake it.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="341">
Truly, Seignior, &s;aid I, you hav$ gue&s;&s;ed
my De&s;ign, and were it not, that I have
Two Ships under my Care, and &s;ome Cargo
of Value on Board, I would bring my whole
Ship's Company on Shore, and make the Ad|venture,
and, perhaps, we might be &s;trong
enough to defend our&s;elves again&s;t whatever
might happen by the Way.</P>
<P>As to that, Seignior, &s;ays he, you would
be in no Danger that would require &s;o many
Men; for you will find but few Inhabitants
any where, and tho&s;e not in Numbers &s;uffi|cient
to give you any Trouble; Fifty Men
would be as many as you would either want
or de&s;ire, and, perhaps, as you would find
Provi&s;ions for; and, for Fifty Men, we
might be able to carry Provi&s;ions with us to
keep them from Di&s;tre&s;s; but if you will ac|cept
of my Advice, as well as A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
Seignior, &s;ays he, choo&s;e a faithful &s;trong
Fellow out of your Ship, on whom you can
depend, and give him Fifty Men with him,
or thereabouts, and &s;uch In&s;tructions as you
may find needful, as to the Place on the
Coa&s;t where you would have them fix their
Stay, and let them take the fir&s;t Hazards of
the Adventure; and as$ you are going round
by Sea, you will, if Succe&s;s follows, meet
them on the Shore; and if the Account they
give of their Journey encourage you, you
may come afterwards your&s;elf up to the&s;e
very Mountains, and take a farther View:
In which Ca&s;e, he added, with a &s;olemn Pro|te&s;tation,
Co&s;t what it will, I will come
and meet you One hundred Miles beyond the
<PB N="129" REF="342">
Hills, with Supplies of Provi&s;ions, and Mules
for your A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>This was &s;uch whole&s;ome and friendly
Advice, and he offer'd it &s;o &s;incerely, that
tho' it was very little differing from my own
De&s;ign, yet I would not be &s;een &s;o to le&s;&s;en his
Prudence in the Mea&s;ures of his Friend&s;hip,
in advi&s;ing it, as to &s;ay, That I had re&s;olv'd
to do &s;o. But, making all po&s;&s;ible Acknow|ledgment
to him for his kind Offers, I told
him, I would take his Advice, and that I
would act ju&s;t according to the Mea&s;ures he
had pre&s;crib'd; and at the &s;ame time, I
a&s;&s;ur'd him, That if I found a convenient
Port to Settle and Fortify in, I would not
fail to come again from <HI>France (for we pa&s;s'd
always as acting from</HI> France, <HI>whatever Na|tion
we were of</HI>) to Relieve and Supply them;
and that if ever I returned &s;afe, I would not
fail to Corre&s;pond with him, by the Pa&s;&s;ages
of the Mountains, and make a better Acknow|ledgment
for his Kindne&s;s, than I had been
able to do yet.</P>
<P>He was going to break off the Di&s;|cour&s;e,
upon the Occa&s;ion of the <HI>Chilian</HI>'s
returning, who was ju&s;t come in from his
Hunting, telling me, We would talk farther
of it by the Way; But I told him, I could
not quite di&s;mi&s;s the Subject; becau&s;e I mu&s;t
be&s;peak him to make &s;ome mention of it to the
<HI>Chilian,</HI> that he might, on his Account, be an
A&s;&s;i&s;tant to our Men, as we &s;aw he was capa|ble
of being, in their pa&s;&s;ing by tho&s;e difficult
Ways, and for their Supply or Provi&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.
Trouble not your &s;elf with that, Seignior,</HI> &s;aid
<PB N="130" REF="343">
he, <HI>for when your Men come, the Care &s;hall be
mine: I'll come my&s;elf as far as this Wealthy</HI>
Chilian'<HI>s, and procure them all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance
this Place can afford them, and do any thing
that offers, to forward them in the Undertaking.</HI></P>
<P>This was &s;o Generous, and &s;o Extraordi|nary,
that I had nothing to &s;ay more, but
to plea&s;e my&s;elf with the apparent Succe&s;s
of my Attempt, and acknowledge the Hap|pine&s;s
of having an Opportunity to oblige &s;o
generous a Spirited and grateful a Per&s;on.</P>
<P>I would, however, have made &s;ome farther
Acknowledgment to our <HI>Chilian</HI> Benefactor;
but I had nothing left, except a Couple of
Hats, and Three Pair of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stockings,
One Pair Silk and the other Two Wor&s;ted,
and tho&s;e I gave him, and made him a great
many Acknowledgments for the Favours he
had &s;hewn us, and the next Morning came
away.</P>
<P>We made little Stay any where el&s;e in
our Return; but making much &s;uch Stages
back as we did forward, we came the Four|teenth
Day to our Patron's Hou&s;e, having
made the Pa&s;&s;age through in &s;omething le&s;s
than Sixteen Days, and the like back in
Fifteen Days, including our &s;tay at the <HI>Chi|lian</HI>'s
one Day. The Length of the Way, ac|cording
to the be&s;t of my Calculations, I
reckon'd to be about One Hundred Seventy
Five <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles, taking it with all its
Windings and Turnings, which were not a few;
but which had this Conveniency with them,
That they gave a more ea&s;y and agreeable
Pa&s;&s;age, and made the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Proverb abun|dantly
<PB N="131" REF="344">
good, namely, <HI>That the farthe&s;t Way
was the neare&s;t Way.</HI></P>
<P>The Civilities I received after this from
my Generous <HI>Spaniard,</HI> were agreeable to the
re&s;t of his U&s;age of me; but we, that had &s;o
great a Charge upon us at the Sea-&s;ide, could
not &s;pare long Time in tho&s;e Ceremonies,
any more than I can do now for relating
them. It is enough to mention, That he
would not be excus'd at parting, from going
back with us quite to the Ships, and when I
would have excus'd it, he &s;aid, Nay, <HI>Seignior,</HI>
give me leave to go and fetch my Ho&s;tages.
In &s;hort, there was no re&s;i&s;ting him, &s;o we
went all together, having &s;tay'd Two Days
more at his Hou&s;e, and came all &s;afe to our
Ships, having been gone Forty Six Days from
them.</P>
<P>We found the Ships in very good Condition,
all &s;afe on Board and well, except that the
Men &s;eem'd to have contracted &s;omething of
the Scurvy; which our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Doctor, how|ever,
&s;oon recovered them of.</P>
<P>Here we found the Two <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Youths,
our Patron's Ho&s;tages, very well al&s;o, and
very well plea&s;ed with their Entertainment:
One of our Lieutenants had been teaching
them Navigation, and &s;omething of the Ma|thematicks,
and they had made very good
Improvement in tho&s;e Things, con&s;idering
the Time they had been there; and the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
their Father, was &s;o plea&s;ed with it, that
having not Gold enough to offer the Lieu|tenant,
as an Acknowledgment for his Teach|ing
them, he gave him a very good Ring
<PB N="132" REF="345">
from his Finger, having a fine large Emerald
in it of good Value, and made him a long
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Compliment, for having nothing of
better Value to offer him.</P>
<P>We now made Preparations for Sailing,
and our Men, in my Ab&s;ence, had laid in a
very con&s;iderable Supply of Provi&s;ions, par|ticularly
excellent Pork, and pretty tolerable
Beef, and a great Number of Goats and Hogs
alive, as many as we could &s;tow.</P>
<P>But I had now my main Undertaking to
manage, I mean that of &s;ending out my little
Army for Di&s;covery, and having communi|cated
my De&s;ign to the Supra Cargo, and the
Per&s;on who I intru&s;ted with him in the Com|mand
of the Ships, they unanimou&s;ly ap|prov'd
of the Thing. My next Bu&s;ine&s;s was,
To re&s;olve upon whom to confer the Com|mand
of the Expedition; and this, by general
Con&s;ent, fell upon the Lieutenant of the <HI>Ma|d$ga&s;car</HI>
Ship, who had taught the young
<HI>Spaniards</HI> Navigation; and this the rather,
becau&s;e he was naturally a bold, enterprizing
Man&punc; and al&s;o an excellent Geographer: In|deed
he was a general Arti&s;t, and a Man
faithful and vigilant in whatever he under|took,
nor was it a little Con&s;ideration with
me, that he was &s;o agreeable to the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
and his Sons, of who&s;e Aid we knew he would
&s;tand in to much need.</P>
<P>When I had communicated to him the De|&s;ign,
and he had both approv'd the Thing
it&s;elf, and accepted the Command, we con|&s;tituted
him Captain, and the Two Mid&s;hip|men
we made Lieutenants for the Expedition,
<PB N="133" REF="346">
promi&s;ing each of them Five Hundred Pounds
if they perform'd it: As for the Captain, we
came to a good Agreement with him for his
Reward; for I engaged to give him One
Thou&s;and bounds in Gold as &s;oon as we met,
if the Journey was perform'd effectually.</P>
<P>We then laid open the Undertaking to the
Men, and le&s;t it to every one's Choice to go,
or not to go, as they pleas'd; but in&s;tead of
wanting Men to go Voluntier, we were fain
to decide it by Lot, among &s;ome of them, they
were all &s;o eager to undertake it.</P>
<P>Then I gave them Articles and Conditions,
which they, who ventur'd, &s;hould engage
them&s;elves to comply with, and particularly,
That they &s;hould not Mutiny, upon Pain of
being Shot to Death when we met, or upon
the Spot, if the Captain thought it nece&s;&s;ary;
That they &s;hould not &s;traggle from their Com|pany,
nor be tempted by the View of pick|ing
up Gold, to &s;tay behind, when the Com|pany
beat to March; That all the Gold they
found in the Way, &s;hould be in common,
&s;hould be put together in Bulk every Night,
and be divided faithfully and equally at the
End of the Journey, allowing only Five
Shares to each Ship, to he divided as I &s;hould
direct; be&s;ides which, upon Condition, That
every Man behav'd him&s;elf faithfully and
quietly, and did their Duty, I promi&s;ed,
That be&s;ides the Gold they might get by the
Way, I would gave them every Man One
Hundred Pounds at our Meeting; and if any
Man was Sick or Maimed by the Way, they
were to engage not to for&s;ake and leave him on
<PB N="134" REF="347">
any Account what&s;oever, Death only ex|cepted;
and if any Man died, except by
any Violence from the re&s;t, his Share of the
Gold which was gotten, &s;hould be faithfully
kept for his Family, if he had any; but his
Reward of One Hundred Pounds, which was
not due, becau&s;e he did not live to demand it,
&s;hould be divided among the re&s;t: So that by
this Agreement, the Undertaking was not &s;o
dear to me as I had expected; for the Pay of
the Men amounted to no more than the Sum
following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>Having pitch'd upon the Men, I landed
them, and made them Encamp on Shore:
But fir&s;t of all, I made them, every one,
make Wills or Letters of Attorney, or
other Di&s;po&s;itions of their Effects, to &s;uch
Per&s;ons as they thought fit, with an Account
under their Hands, Endors'd on the Back of
the &s;aid Wills, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> intimating what Che&s;ts
<PB N="135" REF="348">
or Ca&s;es, or other Things they had on Board,
and what was in them, and what Pay was
due to them; and tho&s;e Che&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were
Sealed up before their Faces with my Seal,
and Writings Sign'd by me, the Contents
unknown: Thus they were &s;ecure, that all they
had left in the Ships, and all that was due to
them, &s;hould be punctually and carefully
kept, and delivered as it was de&s;ign'd and
directed by them&s;elves; and this was greatly
to their Satisfaction.</P>
<P>As to the Reward of One Hundred Pounds
a Man, and the Articles about keeping to|gether,
obeying Orders, gathering up Gold,
and the like; I did not read to them 'till
they were all on Shore, and 'till I was ready
to leave them; becau&s;e if the re&s;t of the Men
had heard it, I &s;hould have kept no Body
with me to have &s;ail'd the Ships.</P>
<P>There was as &s;tout a Company of bold,
young, brisk Fellows of them, as ever went
upon any Expedition, Fifty Three in Number,
among them a Surgeon, and his Mate, very
skilful and hone&s;t Men both of them; a
Trumpeter and a Drummer, Three Ship-Carpenters,
a Cook, who was al&s;o a Butcher
by Trade, and a Barber; Two Shoemakers,
who had been Soldiers among the Pyrates;
a Smith, and a Taylor of the &s;ame, &s;o that
they wanted no Mechanicks, whatever might
happen to them.</P>
<P>Give the Fellows their Due, they took but
little Baggage with them; but, however,
what they had, I took Care, with the
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of my good Patron, the <HI>Spaniard,</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="349">
&s;hould be as much carried for them as po&s;&s;i|ble.
I provided them Three large Tents,
made of a Cotton Stuff, which I bought in
the Country, and which we made up on
Board, which Tents were large enough to
cover them all, in ca&s;e of Rain or Heat; but
as for Beds, or Bedding, they had only Seven
Hammocks, in Ca&s;e any Man was Sick; for
the re&s;t, they were to &s;hift as well as they
could; the Sea&s;on was Hot, and the Climate
good; their Way lay in the Latitude of Forty
to Fifty, and they &s;et out in the latter end of
the Month of <HI>October,</HI> which, on that Side of
the Line, is the &s;ame as our <HI>April;</HI> &s;o that
the Covering was more to keep them from
the Heat than the Cold.</P>
<P>It was needful, in order to their Defence,
to furni&s;h them with Arms and Ammunition;
&s;o I gave to every Man a Mu&s;quet or Fu&s;ee,
a Pi&s;tol and a Sword, with Cartouches, and a
good Stock of Ammunition, Powder and
Shot, with Three &s;mall Barrels at fine Pow|der
for Store, and Lead in proportion; and
the&s;e Things were, indeed, the heavie&s;t Part
of their Baggage, excepting the Carpenters
Tools, and the Surgeons Box of Medicines.</P>
<P>As for the carrying all the&s;e Things, they
might ea&s;ily furni&s;h them&s;elves with Mules or
Hor&s;es for Carriage, while they had Money
to pay for them, and you may judge how
that could be wanting, by what has been &s;aid
of the Country.</P>
<P>We gave them, however, a good large Pack
of <HI>European</HI> Goods, to make agreeable Pre|&s;ents
where they received Favours; &s;uch as
<PB N="137" REF="350">
Black Bays, Pieces of Says, Serge, Calamanca,
Drugget, Hats and Stockings; not forgetting
another Pack of Hatchets, Knives, Sizzers,
Beads, Toys, and &s;uch Things, to plea&s;e the
Natives of the Plain Country, if they &s;hould
meet with any.</P>
<P>They de&s;ir'd a few Hand-Granadoes, and
we gave them about a Dozen, but as they
were heavy, it would have been very trouble|&s;ome
to have carried more.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;tay'd 'till all this was done,
and 'till the Men were ready to march, and
then told us privately, That it would not be
proper for him to march along with them,
or to appear openly, to countenance the En|terprize;
That my Two Lieutenants knew
the Way perfectly well; and that he would
go before to his own Hou&s;e, and they &s;hould
hear of him by the Way.</P>
<P>All the Mules and Hor&s;es which he had
lent us, to bring us back, he left with them
to carry their Baggage, and our new Captain
had bought Six more privately in the Country.</P>
<P>The la&s;t In&s;tructions I gave to our Men,
was, That they &s;hould make the be&s;t of their
Way over the Country beyond the Moun|tains;
That they &s;hould take the exact Di|&s;tances
of Places, and keep a Journal of their
March, &s;et up Cro&s;&s;es and Markes at all pro|per
Places; and that they &s;hould &s;teer their
Cour&s;e, as near as they could, between the
Latitude of Forty, where they would enter
the Country, and the Latitude of Forty Five
<HI>South;</HI> in that they would go an <HI>E. S. E.</HI> Cour&s;e
mo&s;t of the Way, and that where-ever they
<PB N="138" REF="351">
made the Shore, they &s;hould &s;eek for a Creek
or Port where the Ships might come to an
Anchor, and look out Night and Day for
the Ships; the Signals al&s;o were agreed on,
and they had Two Dozen of Rockets to throw
up, if they di&s;covered us at Sea; they had
all nece&s;&s;ary In&s;truments for Ob&s;ervation
al&s;o, and Per&s;pective Gla&s;&s;es, Pocket Com|pa&s;&s;es,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and thus they &s;et out, <HI>October</HI>
24th, 1715.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd Five Days after they began their
March, by Agreement, That if any Oppo&s;i|tion
had been offer'd them in the Country,
or any Umbrage taken at their De&s;ign, &s;o
that it could not be executed, we might have
Notice. But as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Country,
who are the mo&s;t &s;upinely negligent People
in the World, had not the lea&s;t Shadow of
Intelligence, and took them only to be <HI>French</HI>
Seamen, belonging to the Two <HI>French</HI> Ships
(&s;uch we pa&s;t for) who had lain there &s;o lo$g,
they knew nothing when they went away,
much le&s;s whither; but, no que&s;tion, they
believ'd, that they were all gone on Board
again.</P>
<P>We &s;tay'd Three Days longer than we ap|pointed,
and hearing nothing ami&s;s from
them, we were &s;atisfy'd that all was Right
with them; &s;o we put to Sea, &s;tanding off to
the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> 'till we were out of Sight of the
Shore, and then we &s;tood away due <HI>South,</HI>
with a fre&s;h Gale at <HI>N. W.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> and fair
Weather, tho' the Wind chopped about &s;oon
after, and we had Calms and Hot Weather
that did us no good, but made our Men Sick
and Lazy.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="352">
The &s;uppo&s;ed Journey of our Travellers,
their March, and the Adventures they &s;hould
meet with by the Way, were, indeed, &s;uffi|cient
Diver&s;ion; and employ'd us all with
Di&s;cour&s;e, as well in the Great Cabbin and
Round-Hou&s;e, as afore the Ma&s;t, and Wagers
were very rife among us, who &s;hou'd come
fir&s;t to the Shore of <HI>Patagonia,</HI> for &s;o we
call'd it.</P>
<P>As for the Place, neither they nor we could
make any Gue&s;s at what part of the Country
they &s;hould make the Sea; but as for us, we
re&s;olved to make the Port St. <HI>Julian</HI> our fir&s;t
Place to put in at, which is in the Latitude
of Fifty Degrees Five Minutes, and that
then, as Wind and Weather would permit,
we would keep the Coa&s;t as near as we
could, 'till we came to <HI>Punta de St. Helena,</HI>
where we would Ride for &s;ome Time, and,
if po&s;&s;ible, 'till we heard of them.</P>
<P>We had but a cro&s;s Voyage to the Mouth
of the Straights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> having contrary
Winds, as I have &s;aid, and &s;ometimes bad
Weather; &s;o that it was the Thirteenth of
<HI>December</HI> when we made an Ob&s;ervation, and
found Our&s;elves in the Latitude of Fifty
Two Degrees Thirty Minutes, which is ju&s;t
the Height of <HI>Cape Victoria,</HI> at the Mouth of
the Pa&s;&s;age. Some of our Officers were very
much for pa&s;&s;ing the Straights, and not going
about by <HI>Cape Horn;</HI> but the Uncertainty of
the Winds in the Pa&s;&s;age, the Danger of the
Currents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made it by no Means advi&s;able,
&s;o we re&s;olved to keep good Sea-room.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="353">
The Twenty Fifth of <HI>December,</HI> we found
Our&s;elves in the Latitude of Sixty two Degrees
Thirty Minutes, and being <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Day,
I fea&s;ted the Men, and drank the Health of
our Travellers; our Cour&s;e was <HI>S. E.</HI> by <HI>S.</HI>
the Wind <HI>S. W.</HI> then we chang'd our Cour&s;e
and went away <HI>E.</HI> for Eight Days, and ha|ving
made fre&s;h Way, &s;tood away, without
Ob&s;ervation, <HI>E. N. E.</HI> and in Two Days
more, made the Land, on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> of the
Straight <HI>de la Mare,</HI> &s;o that we were oblig'd
to &s;tand away <HI>E. S. E.</HI> to take more Sea-room,
when the Wind veering to the <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI> a fre&s;h
Gale, we &s;tood boldly away due <HI>North,</HI> and
running large, &s;oon found that we were entred
into the <HI>North</HI> Sea, on <HI>Twelfth Day;</HI> for Joy
of which, and to Celebrate the Day, I gave
every Me&s;s a Piece of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beef, and a
Piece of <HI>Chilian</HI> Pork, and made a great Bowl
of Punch afore the Ma&s;t, as well as in the
Great Cabbin, which made our Men very
chearful, and, in&s;tead of a Twelfth-Cake, I
gave the Cook order to make every Me&s;s a
good Plumb-Pudding, which pleas'd them all
as well.</P>
<P>But while we were at our Liquor, and
merry, the Wind came about to the <HI>N. E.</HI>
and blew very hard, threatning us with a
Storm, and as the Shore lay on our Leeward
Quarter, we were not without Apprehen&s;ions
of being driven on &s;ome dangerous Places,
and forced to ride upon Life and Death, where
we could have no Shelter; I immediately
therefore, alter'd my Cour&s;e, and ran away
<HI>Ea&s;t</HI> all Night, to have as much Sea-room as
<PB N="141" REF="354">
po&s;&s;ible: The next Day the Wind abated, and
haling away to the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> we &s;tood <HI>North|ward</HI>
again, and then <HI>N. W.</HI> in Three Days
more, and we made Land, which appear'd to
be the Head I&s;land of Port St. <HI>Julian,</HI> on the
<HI>North</HI> Side of the Port where we run in,
and about an Hour before Sun-&s;et, came to
an Anchor in Eleven Fathom good holding
Ground, Latitude Forty Nine Degrees Eigh|teen
Minutes.</P>
<P>We wanted fre&s;h Water, otherwi&s;e we
would not have made any &s;tay here at all,
for we knew we were a little too far to the
<HI>South;</HI> however, we were oblig'd to fill fre&s;h
Water here for Three Days together, the
watering Place being a good way up the
River, and the Swell of the Sea running very
high.</P>
<P>During this Interval, Captain <HI>Merlote</HI> and
I went on Shore with about Thirty Men, and
march'd up the Country near Twenty Miles,
getting up to the Top of the Hills, where we
made Fires, and at the farthe&s;t Hill we En|camped
all Night, and threw up Five Rockets,
which was our Signal; but we &s;aw nothing
to an&s;wer it, nor any Sign, either of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
People or Natives, in all the Country.</P>
<P>We &s;aw a Noble Champian Country, the
Plains all &s;mooth, and cover'd with Gra&s;s
like <HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain, very little Wood to be
&s;een any where, in&s;omuch, that we could
not get any thing but Gra&s;s to make a Smoke
with, which was another of our Signals.
We &s;hot &s;ome Fowls here, and Five or Six
Hares; the Hares are as large as an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="142" REF="355">
Fox, and Burrow in the Earth like a Rabbet$
The Fowls we &s;hot, were Duck and Mallard
Teal and Widgeon, the &s;ame as in <HI>Englan$</HI>
in Shape and Size, only the Colour generally
Grey, with White in the Brea&s;t, and Gree$
Heads, the Fle&s;h the &s;ame as ours, and very
good.</P>
<P>We &s;aw Wild Gee&s;e and Wild Swans, but
&s;hot none; we &s;aw, al&s;o, Guinacoes o$
<HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep, as big as &s;mall Mules, but
could not come at them neither; for as &s;oon
as we &s;tepp'd towards them, they would call
to one another, to give Notice of us, and
then troop all together, and be gone.</P>
<P>This is an excellent Country for Feeding
and Breeding of Sheep and Hor&s;es, the Gra&s;s
being &s;hort, but very &s;weet and good on the
Plains, and very long and rich near the fre&s;h
Rivers, and were it Cultivated and Stock'd
with Cattle, would, without doubt, produce
excellent Kinds of all Sorts of Cattle; nor
could it fail of producing excellent Corn, as
well Wheat as Ba$ley and Oats; and as for
Peas, they grow Wild all over the Country,
and nouri&s;h an infinite Number of a Birdlike
Pigeons, which fly in Flights &s;o great,
that they &s;eem in the Air like Clouds at a
great Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>As for the Soil, that of the Hills is Gravel
and &s;ome Stony, but that of the Pains, is a
light, black Mould, and in &s;ome Places a
rich Loam, and &s;ome Marle; all of which
are Tokens of Fruitfulne&s;s, &s;uch as indeed
never fa$l.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="356">
The Fourteenth of <HI>January</HI> (the Weather
being hot, and Days long, for this was their
<HI>July</HI>) we weighed and &s;tood <HI>Northerly</HI> along
the Shore, the Coa&s;t running from Port
St. <HI>Julian N. N. E.</HI> 'till we arriv'd at the fa|mous
I&s;lands called <HI>Penguin</HI> I&s;lands; and here
we came to an Anchor again, in the &s;ame
round Bay which Sir <HI>John Narborough</HI> called
<HI>Port De&s;ire,</HI> it being the Seventeenth of <HI>Ja|nuary.</HI></P>
<P>Here we found a Po&s;t, or Cro&s;s, erected
by Sir <HI>John Narborough,</HI> with a Plate of Cop|per
nailed to it, and an In&s;cription, &s;ignifying,
That he had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Coun|try
in the Name of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. Our
Men rai&s;ed a Shout for Joy that they were
in their own King's Dominions, or, as they
&s;aid, in their own Country; and, indeed,
excepting that it was not inhabited by <HI>Engli&s;h|men,</HI>
and cultivated, planted, and inclo&s;ed,
after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manner, I never &s;aw a
Country in the World &s;o like <HI>England</HI></P>
<P>Here we victualled our Ships with a new
kind of Food; for we loaded our&s;elves with
Seals, of which here are an infinite Number,
and which we &s;alted and eat, and our Men
liked them wonderfully for a while; but they
&s;oon began to be weary of them: Al&s;o the
<HI>Penguins</HI> are a very whole&s;ome Diet, and
very plea&s;ant, e&s;pecially when a little &s;alted;
and as for Salt, we could have loaded our
Ship with it, being very good and white,
made by the Sun, and found in &s;tanding
Ponds of Salt-water, near the Shore.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="357">
The <HI>Penguins</HI> are &s;o ea&s;ily kill'd, and are
found in &s;uch va&s;t Multitudes on that I&s;land,
(which, for that Rea&s;on, is &s;o called) that
our Men loaded the Long-boat with them
twice in one Day, and we reckoned there
were no le&s;s than Seven thou&s;and in the Boat
each Time.</P>
<P>Here we travelled up into the Country
in Search of our Men, and made our Signals,
but had no An&s;wer to them, nor heard any
Intelligence of them. We &s;aw &s;ome People
here at a Di&s;tance, &s;cattering about; but
they were but few, nor would they be brought
by any Means to conver&s;e with us, or come
near us.</P>
<P>We &s;pread our&s;elves over the Country
far and wide; and here we &s;hot Hares and
Wild-Fowl again in Abundance, the Country
being much the &s;ame as before, but &s;omething
more bu&s;hy, and here and there a few Trees,
but they were a great way off. There is a
large River which empties it&s;elt into this
Bay.</P>
<P>Finding no News here of our Men, I or|dered
the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Ship to weigh and &s;tand
farther <HI>North,</HI> keeping as near the Shore as
be might with Safety, and cau&s;ing his Men
to look out for the Signals, which, if they
di&s;covered, they &s;hould give us Notice by
firing Three Guns.</P>
<P>They &s;ailed the Height of <HI>Cape Blanco,</HI>
where the Land falling back, makes a deep
Bay, and the Sea receives into it a great
River at &s;everal Mouths, &s;ome of them Twen|ty
Leagues from the other, all farther
<PB N="145" REF="358">
<HI>North.</HI> Here they &s;tood into the Bay 'till they
made the Land again; for at the fir&s;t Open|ing
of the Bay, they could not &s;ee the Bot|tom
of it, the Land lying very low.</P>
<P>The Captain was doubtful what he &s;hould
do upon the Appearance of &s;o large a Bay,
and was loth to &s;tand farther in, le&s;t the
Land, pu&s;hing out into the Sea again after|wards,
and a Gale &s;pringing up from Sea|ward,
they might be &s;hut into a Bay where
they had no Knowledge of the Ground; and
upon this Caution, they re&s;olved among them|&s;elves
to come to an Anchor for that Even|ing,
and to put farther out to Sea the next
Morning.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the next Morning, he weigh'd,
and &s;tood off to Sea; but the Weather being
very fine, and the little Wind that blew, be|ing
<HI>S. W.</HI> by <HI>S.</HI> he ventured to &s;tand in for
the Shore, where he found Two or Three
&s;mall Creeks, and one large River, and &s;end|ing
in his <HI>Shalloup</HI> to &s;ound, and find out a
good Place to ride in, upon their making
the Signal to him, that they had found &s;uch
a Place, he &s;tood in, and came to an An|chor
in Eleven Fathom good Ground, Half
a League from the Shore, and well defend|ed
from the <HI>Northerly</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;terly</HI> Winds,
which were the Winds we had any Rea&s;on
to fear.</P>
<P>Having thus brought his Ship to an Anchor,
he &s;ent his <HI>Shalloup</HI> along the Shore to give me
an Account of it, and de&s;ire me to come up
to him, which accordingly we did; and here we
re&s;olved to ride for &s;ome Time, in hopes
<PB N="146" REF="359">
to hear from our little Army. We went on
Shore, &s;ome or other of us, every Day, and
e&s;pecially when Five of our Men, going on
Shore on the <HI>North</HI> Side of the River, had
&s;hot Three <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep, and a black wild
Bull; for after that, they ranged the Country
far and near to find more, but could never
come within Shot of them, except Three
Bulls and a Cow, which they kill'd after a
long Cha&s;e.</P>
<P>We lay here 'till the Sixteenth of <HI>February,</HI>
without any News of our Travellers, as I
called them. All the Hopes we had, was,
that Five of our Men, a&s;king my Leave to
travel, &s;wore to me, They would go quite
up to the <HI>Andes,</HI> but they would find them;
nay, They would go to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentle|man
him&s;elf, if they did not hear of them;
and obliged me to &s;tay Twenty Days for
them, and no longer. This I promi&s;ed them,
and giving them every thing they a&s;ked, and
Two of the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep to carry their
Ammunition, with Two Dozen of Rockets for
Signals, a Speaking-Trumpet, and a good
Per&s;pective-Gla&s;s, away they went; and from
them we had yet heard no News, &s;o that was
our pre&s;ent Hope.</P>
<P>They travelled, as they afterwards gave
an Account, One hundred and Twenty Miles
up the Country, 'till they were at la&s;t forced
to re&s;olve to kill one of their <HI>Guinacos,</HI> or
Sheep, to &s;atisfy their Hunger, which was a
great Grief to them; for their Luggage was
heavy to carry; but, I &s;ay, they only re|&s;olved
on it, for ju&s;t as they were going to
<PB N="147" REF="360">
do it, one of them rouzed a Deer with a Fawn,
and, by great good luck, &s;hot them both;
for having killed the Doe, the Fawn &s;tood
&s;till by her, 'till he had loaded his Piece again,
and &s;hot that al&s;o.</P>
<P>This &s;upplied them for Four or Five Days
plentifully, and the la&s;t Day, one of my
Men, being by the Bank of the River, for
they kept as near the River as they could, in
hopes to hear of them that Way, &s;aw &s;ome|thing
black come driving down the Stream;
he could not reach it, but calling one of his
Fellows, their Curio&s;ity was &s;uch, that the
other, being a good Swimmer, &s;tripped, and put
off to it, and when he came to it, he found
it was a Man's Hat; this made them conclude
their Fellows were not far off, and that they
were coming by Water.</P>
<P>Upon this, they made to the fir&s;t Ri&s;ing
Ground they could come at, and there they
encamped, and, at Night, fired &s;ome Rockets,
(they kept looking out, you may be &s;ure) and
after the Third Rocket was fired, they, to
their great Joy, &s;aw Two Rockets ri&s;e up
from the <HI>We&s;tward,</HI> and &s;oon after that, a
Third; and in Two Days more, they all
joyfully met, as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>We had been here, as I have &s;aid, impa|tiently
expecting them a great while; but at
la&s;t, the Man at the Main-Top, who was
ordered to look out, called aloud to us be|low,
that he &s;aw a Fla&s;h of Fire, and imme|diately,
the Men looking to Land-ward,
they &s;aw Two Rockets ri&s;e up in the Air at a
great Di&s;tance, which we an&s;wered by firing
<PB N="148" REF="361">
Three Rockets again, and they returned by
One Rocket, to &s;ignify, that they &s;aw our
Mens Signal.</P>
<P>This was a joyful Exchange of di&s;tant
Language to both Sides, but I was not there;
for being impatient, I had put out, and &s;ailed
about Ten Leagues farther; but our Ship
fired Three Guns to give me Notice, which,
however, we heard not, and yet we knew
they fired too; for, it being in the Night,
our Men, who were very attentive with their
Eyes, as well as Ears, &s;aw plainly the Three
Fla&s;hes of the Guns, though they could not
hear the Report, the Wind being contrary,
This was &s;uch certain Intelligence to me, and
I was &s;o impatient to know how Things went,
that, having al&s;o a &s;mall all Gale of Wind, I
weighed immediately, and &s;tood back again
to our other Ship; it was not, however, 'till
the Second Day after we weighed, that we
came up to them, having little or no Wind
all the Fir&s;t Day; the next Day, in the Morn|ing,
they &s;pied us, and fired the Three Guns
again, being the Signal, that they had got
News of our Friends.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more to my Satisfaction,
than to hear, that they had got News, and
it was as much to their Satisfaction as to
ours, to be &s;ure, I mean our little Army; for
if any Di&s;u&s;ter had happened to us, they
had been in a very odd Condition, and tho'
they might have found Means to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, yet
they would have been out of all Hope of ever
returning to their own Country.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="362">
Upon the Signal, I &s;tood into the Bay,
and came to an Anchor at about a League
to the <HI>Northward</HI> of our other Ship, and as
far from the Shore; and, as it were, in the
Mouth of the River, waiting for another Sig|nal
from our Men, by which we might judge,
which Side of the River to go a Shore at,
and might take &s;ome proper Mea&s;ures to
come at them.</P>
<P>About Five a Clock in the Evening, our
Eyes, being all up in the Air, and towards
the Hills, for the appointed Signals, beheld,
to our great Surprize, a <HI>Canoe</HI> come rowing
to us out of the Mouth of the River; imme|diately
we went to work with our Per&s;pe|ctive
Gla&s;&s;es. One &s;aid it was one Thing,
and one &s;aid it was another, 'till I fetched
out a large Telle&s;cope out of the Cabbin, and
with that I could ea&s;ily &s;ee they were my
own Men, and it was to our inexpre&s;&s;ible Satis|faction,
that they &s;oon after came directly
on Board.</P>
<P>It might very well take up another Vo|lume,
as large as this, to give a farther Ac|count
of the Particulars of their Journey, or
rather their Journey and Voyage; How they
got through the Hills, and were entertained
by the generous <HI>Spaniard;</HI> and afterwards by
the Wealthy <HI>Chilian:</HI> How the Men, greedy
for Gold, were hardly brought away from
the Mountains: And how, once, they had
much ado to per&s;uade them not to rob the
hone&s;t <HI>Chilian</HI> who had u&s;ed them &s;o well,
'till my Lieutenant, then their Captain, by
a Stratagem &s;eized on all their Weapons, and
<PB N="150" REF="363">
threatned to &s;peak to the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to rai&s;e
all the <HI>Chilians</HI> in the Mountains, and have
all their Throats cut; and yet, that even
this did not &s;uffice, 'till the Two Mid&s;hip|men,
then their Lieutenants, a&s;&s;ured them,
that at the fir&s;t Opening of the Hills, and in
the Rivers beyond, they would have Plenty
of Gold, and one of the Mid&s;hipmen told
them, That if he did not &s;ee them have &s;o
much Gold, that they would not &s;toop to
take up any more, they &s;hould have all his
Share to be divided among them, and &s;hould
leave him behind in the fir&s;t de&s;olate Place
they could find.</P>
<P>How this appea&s;ed them 'till they came to
the outer Edge of the Mountains, where I
had been, and where my Patron the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
left them, having &s;upplied them with Sixteen
Mules to carry their Baggage, and &s;ome Gui|nacoes,
or Sheep of <HI>Peru,</HI> which would carry
Burthens, and afterwards be good to eat
al&s;o.</P>
<P>Al&s;o, How here they mutiny'd again, and
would not be drawn away, being in&s;atiable
in their Thir&s;t after the Gold, 'till about
Twenty, more rea&s;onable than the re&s;t, were
content to move forward and, after &s;ome
Time, the re&s;t followed, though not 'till they
were a&s;&s;ured, that the picking up of Gold
continued all along the River, which began
at the Bottom of the Mountains, and that
it was likely to continue a great way far|ther.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="364">
How they worked their Way down the&s;e
Streams, with &s;till an in&s;atiable Avarice and
Thir&s;t after the Gold, to the Lake called
<HI>The Golden-Lake,</HI> and how here they were
a&s;toni&s;hed at the Quantity they found: How,
after this, they had great Difficulty to fur|ni&s;h
them&s;elves with Provi&s;ions, and greater
&s;till, in carrying it along with them 'till
they found more.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, All the&s;e Accounts might &s;uffice to
make a Volume as large as all the re&s;t: How,
at the farther End of this Lake, they found
that it evacuated it&s;elf into a large River,
which, running away, with a &s;trong Current,
to the <HI>S. S. E.</HI> and afterwards to the <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>E.</HI>
encouraged them to build Canoes, in which
they imbarked, and which River brought
them down to the very Bay where we found
them; but that they met with many Diffi|culties,
&s;unk, and &s;taved their Canoes &s;eve|ral
Times, by which they lo&s;t &s;ome of their
Baggage, and, in one Di&s;a&s;ter, lo&s;t a great
Parcel of their Gold, to their great Surprize
and Mortification: How, at one Place, they
&s;plit Two of their Canoes, where they could
find no Timber to build new ones, and the
many Hard&s;hips they were put to before
they got other Canoes; But I &s;hall give a
brief Account of it all, and bring it into as
narrow a Compa&s;s as I can.</P>
<P>They &s;et out, as I have &s;aid, with Mules
and Hor&s;es to carry their Baggage, and the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> gave them a Servant with them for
a Guide, who carrying them By ways, and
Unfrequented, &s;o that they might give no
<PB N="152" REF="365">
Alarm at the Town of <HI>Villa Rica,</HI> or any where
el&s;e, they came to the Mouth of the
Entrance into the Mountains, and there they
pitched their Tent.</P>
<Q><HI>N. B. The Lieutenant who kept their Jou|rnal,
giving an Account of this, merrily,
In his Sea Language, expre&s;&s;es it thus;</HI>
Being all come &s;afe into the Opening that
is in the Entrance of the Mountains, and
being there free from the Ob&s;ervation of
the Country, we called it our fir&s;t Port, &s;o
we brought <HI>too,</HI> and came <HI>to an Anchor.</HI></Q>
<P>Here the generous <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who, at his
own Reque&s;t, was gone before, &s;ent his Gen|tleman,
and one of his Sons, to them, and
&s;ent them Plenty of Provi&s;ions, as al&s;o cau&s;ed
their Mules to be changed for others that were
fre&s;h, and had not been fatigued with any
of the other Part of the Journey.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things being done, the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s
Gentleman cau&s;ed them to decamp, and march
Two Days farther into the Mountains, and
then they encamped again, where the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
him&s;elf came <HI>Incognito</HI> to them, and, with
the utmo&s;t Kindne&s;s and Genero&s;ity, was
their Guide him&s;elf, and their Purveyor al&s;o,
though Two or Three Times, the Fellows
were &s;o rude, &s;o ungovernable, and unbound|ed
in their hunting after Gold, that the <HI>Spa|niard</HI>
was almo&s;t frighted at them, and told
the Captain of it: Nor, indeed, was it alto|gether
without Cau&s;e for the Dogs were &s;o
ungrateful, that they robbed Two of the
<PB N="153" REF="366">
Hou&s;es of the <HI>Chilians,</HI> and took what Gold
they had, which was not much indeed, but it
hazarded &s;o much the Alarming the Coun|try,
and rai&s;ing all the <HI>Mountaineers</HI> upon
them, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was upon the Point
of flying from them, in Spight of all their
Fire-Arms and Courage.</P>
<P>But the Captain begged him to &s;tay one
Night more, and promi&s;ed to have the Fellows
puni&s;hed, and Satisfaction to be made; and &s;o
he brought all his Men together and talked
to them, and enquired who it was: But ne|ver
was &s;uch a piece of Work in the World:
When the new Captain came to talk of who
did it, and of Puni&s;hment, they cryed, They
all did it, and they did not value all the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> or <HI>Indians</HI> in the Country; they
would have all the Gold in the whole Moun|tain,
ay, that they would, By&mdash;and
&s;wore to it, and if the <HI>Spaniard</HI> offer'd to
&s;peak a Word to them, they would whip his
Head off, and the like.</P>
<P>However, a little Rea&s;oning with them,
brought &s;ome of the Men to their Sen&s;es, and
the Captain, who was a Man of Sen&s;e and of
a &s;mooth Tongue, managed &s;o well, that he
brought about 22 of the Men, and the Two
Lieutenants and Surgeons to declare for his
Opinion, and that they would act better for the
future; and with the&s;e, he clapt in between
the other Fellows, and &s;eparated about 18
of them from their Arms, for they had run
&s;cattering among the Rocks to hunt for Gold,
and when they were called to this Parley, had
not their Weapons with them: By t his
<PB N="154" REF="367">
Stratagem he &s;eized Eleven of the Thieves,
and made them Pri&s;oners; and then he told the
re&s;t in &s;o many Words, that if they would not
comply to keep Order, and obey the Rules
they were at fir&s;t &s;worn to, and had promi&s;ed,
he would force them to it, for he would de|liver
them, bound Hand and Foot, to the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> and they &s;hould do the poor
<HI>Chilians</HI> Ju&s;tice upon them, for that, in &s;hort,
he would not have the re&s;t murthered for them;
upon this, he ordered his Men to draw up, to
&s;hew them he would be as good as his Word,
but they con&s;idered of it, and &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had taken a wi&s;er Cour&s;e
than this, or, perhaps, they had been all mur|thered;
for, he ran to the two <HI>Chilian</HI> Hou&s;es
where the Rogues had plunder'd, and where,
in &s;hort, there was a kind of little Hubbub
about it, and with good Words, promi&s;ing
to give them as much Gold as they lo&s;t, and the
Price of &s;ome other Things that were taken
away, he appealed the People; and &s;o our
Men were not ruined, as they would certainly
have been, if the Mountaineers had taken the
Alarm.</P>
<P>After this, they grew a little more gover|nable,
but, in &s;hort, the Sight of the Gold, and
the ea&s;y getting it, for they pick'd it up in
abundance of Places; I &s;ay, the Sight of the
Gold, made them &s;tark mad; for now, they
were not as they were before, trafficking for
the Owners and for the Voyage: But, as I had
promi&s;ed the Gold they got &s;hould be their
own, and that they were now Working for
them&s;elves, there was no getting them to go
<PB N="155" REF="368">
on, but, in &s;hort, they would dwell here; and
this was as fatal a Humour as the other.</P>
<P>But to bring this part of the Voyage to an
End, after Eight Days they came to the
Ho&s;pitable Wealthy <HI>Chilian's</HI> Hou&s;e, who I
mention'd before; and here, as the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
had contriv'd it, they found all kind of need|ful
Stores for Provi&s;ions laid up, as it were, on
purpo&s;e; and, in a Word, here they were not
Fed only, but Fea&s;ted.</P>
<P>Here again, the Captain di&s;covered a cur&s;ed
Con&s;piracy, which, had it taken Effect, would,
be&s;ides the Ba&s;ene&s;s of the Fact, have ended in
their total De&s;truction; in &s;hort, they had
re&s;olved to rob this <HI>Chilian</HI> who was &s;o kind to
them; but, as I &s;aid, one of the Lieutenants di&s;|covered
and detected this villainous Contri|vance,
and qua&s;h'd it, &s;o as never to let the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> know of it.</P>
<P>But, I &s;ay, to end this Part; They were One
and Twenty Days in this Traver&s;e, for they
could not go on &s;o ea&s;y and &s;o fa&s;t, now they
were a little Army, as we did, who were
out Six or Seven; At length they came to the
View of the open Country, and, being all
Encamped, at the Edge of a De&s;cent, the
Generous <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and his three Servants,
took his Leave, wi&s;hing them a good Journey,
and &s;o went back, having the Day before,
brought them &s;ome Deer, Five or Six Cows
and &s;ome Sheep, for their Sub&s;i&s;ting at their
Entrance into, and Travel thro' the plain
Country.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="369">
And now they began to de&s;cend towards the
Plain, but they met with more Difficulty
here than they expected; for, as I ob&s;erved,
that the Way, for &s;ome Miles, went with an
A&s;cent, towards the farthe&s;t part of the Hill,
that continued A&s;cent, had by Degrees,
brought them to a very great, and, in &s;ome
Places, an unpa&s;&s;able De&s;cent, &s;o that, how|ever
my Guide found his Way down,
when I was through, it was not &s;o ea&s;y for
them to do it, who were &s;o many in Number, and
incumbred with Mules and Hor&s;es, and
with their Baggage, &s;o that they knew not what
to do; and if they had not known that our
Ships were gone away, there had been &s;ome
Odds, but, like the old <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> they would
have murmured again&s;t their Leader, and
have all gone back to <HI>Egypt.</HI> In a Word,
they were at their Wits End, and knew not
what Cour&s;e to take for two or three Days,
trying and e&s;&s;aying to get down here and
there, and then frighted with Precipices and
Rocks, and climbing up to get back again;
the whole of the Matter was, that they had
mi&s;s'd a narrow Way, where they &s;hould have
turn'd off to the <HI>S. E.</HI> the Marks which our
Men had made before, having not been &s;o
regular and exact ju&s;t there, as in other
Parts of the Way, or &s;ome other Turning
being &s;o very like the fame, that they took
one for the other; and thus going &s;traight
forward too far, before they turn'd, they
came to an Opening indeed, and &s;aw the plain
Country under them, as they had done before;
but the De&s;cent was not &s;o practicable.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="370">
After they had puzzled them&s;elves here, as
I &s;aid, two or three Days, one of the Lieute|nants
and a Man with him, &s;eeing a Hut or
Hou&s;e of a <HI>Chilian</HI> at &s;ome Di&s;tance, rode
away towards it; but pa&s;&s;ing into a Valley
that lay between, he met with a River which
he could by no means get over with the Mules;
&s;o he came back again in De&s;pair: The Cap|tain
then re&s;olved to &s;end back to the hone&s;t
rich <HI>Chilian,</HI> who had entertained them &s;o
well, for a Guide, or to de&s;ire him to give them
&s;uch Directions, as they might not mi&s;take.</P>
<P>But as the Per&s;on &s;ent back, was one of
tho&s;e who had taken the Journal which I
mentioned, and was therefore greatly vek'd at
mi&s;&s;ing his Way in &s;uch a Manner; &s;o he had
his Eyes in every Corner, and pulled out his
Pocket-Book at every Turning, to &s;ee how the
Marks of Places agreed; and at la&s;t, the
very next Morning after he &s;et out, he
&s;pied the Turning where they &s;hould all have
gone in, to have come to the Place which they
were at before: This being &s;o remarkable a
Di&s;covery, he came back again directly, with|out
going on to the <HI>Chilian's</HI> Hou&s;e, which was
two Days Journey farther.</P>
<P>Our Men were reviv'd with this Di&s;covery,
and all agreed to march back; &s;o, having lo&s;t
about Six Days in this fal&s;e Step, they got in|to
the right Way, and in Four more, came to
the De&s;cent, where I had been before.</P>
<P>Here the Hill was &s;till very high, and the
Pa&s;&s;age down, was &s;teep and difficult enough;
but &s;till, it was practicable, and our Men
could &s;ee the Marks of Cattle having pa&s;s'd
<PB N="158" REF="371">
there, as if they had gone in Drifts or Droves;
al&s;o it was apparent, that, by &s;ome Help and
Labour of Hands, the Way might be led
Winding and Turning on the Slope of the Hill,
&s;o as to make it much ea&s;ier to get down than it was now.</P>
<P>It co&s;t them no &s;mall Labour, however, to
get down, chiefly becau&s;e of the Mules, which
very often fell down with their Loads, and our
Men &s;aid, they believ'd, they could, with much
more Ea&s;e, have mounted up from the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Side
to the Top, than they came from the <HI>We&s;t</HI> Side
to the Bottom.</P>
<P>They incamped one Night on the Declivity
of the Hill, but got up early, and was at the
Bottom and on the plain Ground by Noon:
As &s;oon as they came there, they incamped
and refre&s;hed them&s;elves, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> went
to Dinner; but it being very hot there, the
cool Breezes of the Mountains having now left
them, they were more inclined to Sleep than
to Eat; &s;o the Captain ordered the Tent to
be &s;et up, and they made the whole Day of it,
calling a Council in the Morning to con&s;ider
what Cour&s;e they &s;hould &s;teer, and how they
&s;hould go on.</P>
<P>Here they came to this Re&s;olution, That
they &s;hould &s;end a Man or two, a con&s;iderable
Way up the Hill again, to take the &s;tricte&s;t
Ob&s;ervation he could of the Plain, with the
large&s;t Gla&s;&s;es they had, and to mark which
Way the neare&s;t River or Water was to be
&s;een; and they &s;hould direct their Cour&s;e, fir&s;t
to the Water, and that if the Cour&s;e of it lay
S. or any way to the E. of the S. they would
<PB N="159" REF="372">
follow on the Bank of It, and as &s;oon as it was
large enough to carry them, they would make
them &s;ome Canoes or Shaloups, or what they
could do, with the mo&s;t Ea&s;e, to carry them
on by Water, al&s;o they directed him to ob&s;erve
if he could &s;ee any Cattle feeding at a Di&s;tance,
or the like.</P>
<P>The Me&s;&s;enger returned, and brought them
Word, that all the Way to the <HI>E.</HI> and &s;o on
to <HI>S. E</HI> they could di&s;cover nothing of Water,
but that they had &s;een a great Lake or Lough
of Water at a great Di&s;tance, which looked
like a Sea, and lay from them to the <HI>Northward</HI>
of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> about two Points; adding, That
they did not know, but it might afterwards
empty it &s;elf to the <HI>Ea&s;tward,</HI> and it was their
Opinion to make the be&s;t of their Way
thither.</P>
<P>Accordingly the next Morning they de|camped
and marched <HI>E. N. E.</HI> very chearfully,
but found the Way much longer than they
expected; for though from the Mountains, the
Country &s;eemed to lie flat and plain, yet when
they came, to mea&s;ure it by their Feet, they
found a great many little Hills; Little, I &s;ay,
compared to the great Mountains, but Great
to them who were to Travel over them in the
Heat, and with but very indifferent Support as
to Provi&s;ions, &s;o that in a Word, the Captain
very prudently ordered, that they &s;hould travel
one three Hours in the Morning, and three
Hours in the Evening, and incamp in the Heat
of the Day, to refre&s;h them&s;elves as well as
they could.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="373">
The be&s;t Thing they met with in that Part
of the Country, was, That they had Plenty of
Water; for though they were not yet come to
any large con&s;iderable River, yet, every low
piece of Ground, had a &s;mall Rill of Water in
it; and the Springs coming out from the ri&s;ing
Grounds, on the Sides of the Mountains, being
innumerable, made many &s;uch &s;mall Brooks.</P>
<P>It co&s;t them Six Days Travel, with Two Days
re&s;ting between, to advance to that River of
Water, which, from the Height of the Moun|tains,
&s;eemed to be but a little Way off; They
could not march, by their Computation, above
Ten or Twelve Miles a Day, and re&s;t every
third Day too, for their Luggage was heavy
and their Mules but few; al&s;o &s;ome of their
Mules tyred and jaded, by their long March,
or fell lame, and were good for nothing.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, the Days which I call Days
of Re&s;t, were really not &s;o to them, for tho&s;e
Intervals were imployed to range about and
hunt for Food; and it was for that, more than
for Want of Re&s;t, that they halted every
Third Day.</P>
<P>In this Exerci&s;e they did, however, meet with
&s;uch Succe&s;s, that they made &s;hift to kill one &s;ort
of Creature or another every Day, &s;ufficient to
keep them from fami&s;hing, &s;ometimes they
met with &s;ome Deer, other times with the
<HI>Guinacoes</HI> or <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep, and &s;ometimes
with Fowls of &s;everal kinds, &s;o that they did
pretty well for Food: At length, <HI>viz.</HI> the Se|venth
Day, they came to a River, which was at
fir&s;t &s;mall, but having received another &s;mall
River or two from the <HI>Northern</HI> Part of the
<PB N="161" REF="374">
Country, began to &s;eem large enough for
their Purpo&s;e, and as it ran <HI>E. S. E.</HI> they con|cluded
it would run into the Lake, and that
they might Fleet down this River, if they
could make any thing to carry them.</P>
<P>But their fir&s;t Di&s;couragement was, the
Country was all open, with very little Wood,
and no Trees, or very few, to be found large
enough to make <HI>Canoes,</HI> or Boats of any Sort;
but the Skill of their Carpenters, of which they
had Four, &s;oon conquered this Difficulty; for
coming to a low &s;wampy Ground, on the Side
of the River, they found a Tree &s;omething like
a Beech, very firm good &s;ort of Wood; and yet
soft enough to Work ea&s;y; and they went to
Work with this, and, at fir&s;t, made them &s;ome
Rafts,; which they thought might carry
them along, till the River was bigger.</P>
<P>While this was doing (which took up two or
three Days) the Men &s;traggled up and down;
&s;ome with their Guns to &s;hoot Fowls, &s;ome
with Contrivances to catch Fi&s;h, &s;ome one
thing, &s;ome another; when, on a &s;udden, one
of their Fi&s;hermen, not in the River, but in a
little Brook, which afterwards run into the
River, found a little bit of &s;hining Stuff among
the Sand, or Earth, in the Bank; and one
cryed, he had found a piece of Gold: Now it
&s;eems all was not Gold that gli&s;ter'd, for
the Lump had no Gold in it, whatever it was;
but the Word being given out at fir&s;t, it im|mediately
&s;et all our Men a Romaging the
Shores of every little Rill of Water they came
at, to &s;ee if there was no Gold; and they had
not looked long, but they found &s;everal little
<PB N="162" REF="375">
Grains of Gold very &s;mall and fine, not only
in this Brook, but in &s;everal others: So they
&s;pent their Time the more chearfully, becau&s;e
they made some Purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>All this while they &s;aw no People, nor any
Signals of any, except once on the other Side
of the River, at a great Di&s;tance, they thought
they &s;aw about Thirty together, but whether
Men or Women, or how many of each, they
could not tell, nor would they come any
nearer; only &s;tood and gazed at our People at
a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>They were now ready to quit their Camp
and embark, intending to lay all their Bag|gage
on the Rafts, with three or four Sick
Men, and &s;o the re&s;t to march by the River|Side,
and as many as could, to ride upon the
Mules; when, on a &s;udden, all their Naviga|tion
was put to a Stop, and their new Ve&s;&s;els,
&s;uch as they were, &s;uffered a Wreck: The
Ca&s;e was thus, They had ob&s;erved a great
many black Clouds to hang over the Tops of
the Mountains, and &s;ome of them even below
the Tops, and they did believe it rained
among the Hills, but in the Plain where they
lay, and all about them, it was fair, and
the Weather fine.</P>
<P>But in the Night, the Carpenters and their
A&s;&s;i&s;tants, who had &s;et up a little Tent near
the River Side, were alarmed with a great
roaring Noi&s;e (as they thought) in the River,
tho' at a Di&s;tance upwards; presently after,
they found the Water begin to come into
their Tent; when, running out, they found the
<PB N="163" REF="376">
River was &s;welling over its Banks and all the
low Grounds on both Sides of them.</P>
<P>To their great Satisfaction it was ju&s;t break
of Day, &s;o that they could &s;ee enough to make
their Way from the Water, and the Land
Very happily ri&s;ing a little to the <HI>S.</HI> of the
River, they immediately fled thither; two of
them had &s;o much Pre&s;ence of Mind with
them, as to pick up their Working Tools, at
lea&s;t &s;ome of them, and carry off, and the
Water ri&s;ing gradually, the other two Car|penters
ventured back to &s;ave the re&s;t; but
they were put to it to get back again with
them; in a Word, the Water ro&s;e to &s;uch a
Height, that it carried away their Tent, and
every Thing that was in it, and, which was
wor&s;e, their Rafts, (for they had almo&s;t fi|ni&s;hed
Four large Rafts) were all lifted
off from the Place where they were fram'd,
which was a kind of a dry Dock, and da&s;h'd
all to Pieces, and the Timber, &s;uch as it was,
all carried away: The &s;maller Brooks al&s;o
&s;well'd in Proportion to the larger River;
&s;o that, in a Word, our Men lay, as it were,
&s;urrounded with Water, and began to be in
a terrible consternation; for tho' they lay
in a hard dry Piece of Ground, too high for
the Land-Flood to reach them, yet had the
Rains continued in the Mountains, they
might have lain there till they had been oblig'd
to cat one another, and &s;o there had been an
End of our new Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>But the Weather clear'd up among the Hills
the next Day, which hearten'd them up again;
and as the Flood ro&s;e &s;o &s;oon, &s;o the Current
<PB N="164" REF="377">
being furiou&s;ly rapid, the Waters run off a|gain
as ea&s;ily as they came on, and in Two
Days the Water was all gone again. But our
little Float was &s;hipwreck'd, as I have &s;aid, and
the Carpenters finding how dangerous &s;uch
great unweildy Rafts would be, re&s;olved to &s;et
to it, and build one large Float with Sides to it
like a Punt or Ferry-boat. They work'd &s;o
hard at this, Ten of the Men always work|ing
with them to help, that in Five Days
they had her fini&s;hed: The only Thing they
wanted was Pitch and Tar, to make her Up|per-Work
keep out the Water; and they
made a Shift to fetch a Juice out of &s;ome of
the Wood they had cut, by Help of Fire,
that an&s;wered the End tolerably well.</P>
<P>But that which made this Di&s;appointment
le&s;s afflicting, was, That our other Men hun|ting
about the &s;mall Streams where this Wa|ter
had come down &s;o furiou&s;ly, found that
there was more Gold, and the more for the
late Flood. This made them run &s;traggling
up the Streams; and, as the Captain &s;aid,
he thought once they would run quite back
to the Mountains again.</P>
<P>But that was his Ignorance too, for after a
while, and the nearer they came to the Ri&s;ing
of the Hills, the Quantity abated; for where
the Streams were &s;o furious, the Water wa&s;h'd
it all away, and carried it down with it; &s;o
that by the End of Five Days the Men found
but little, and began to come back again.</P>
<P>But then they di&s;covered, that, tho' there
was le&s;s in the higher Part of the Rivers,
there was more farther down, and they found
<PB N="165" REF="378">
it &s;o well worth while, that they went fi&s;h|ing
along for Gold all the Way towards the
Lake, and left their Fellows and the Boat to
come after.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, when nothing el&s;e would do it,
Hunger call'd them off, and &s;o, once more,
they got all their Company together again;
and now they began to load the Float, indeed
it might be call'd a Luggage Boat: However,
it an&s;wered very well, and was a great Relief
to our Men; but when they came to load it,
they found it would not carry &s;o much by a
great deal as they had to put in it, be&s;ides,
that they would be all oblig'd to march on
Foot by the Shore, which had this particular
Inconvenience in it, That whenever they came
to any &s;mall River or Brook, which run into
the other, as was very often the Ca&s;e, they
would be forc'd to march up a great Way to
get over it, or unload the great Float to
make a Ferry-boat of it to wa&s;t them over.</P>
<P>Upon this, they re&s;olved, that the fir&s;t Place
they came at, where Stuff was to be had for
building, they would go to work again, and
make Two or Three more Floats not &s;o big as
the other, that &s;o they might embark them|&s;elves,
and their Stuff, and their Provi&s;ions too
all together, and take the full Benefit of the
River, where it would afford them Help, and
not &s;ome foil on the Water, and &s;ome go on
Foot upon the Land, which was very fatigue|ing.</P>
<P>Upon this, as &s;oon as they found Stuff, as
I have &s;aid, and a convenient Place, they
went all Hands to work to build more Floats
<PB N="166" REF="379">
or Boats, call them as you will: While this
was doing, all the &s;pare Men, and all the
Men at &s;pare Hours, &s;pent their Time and
Pains in Hunting about for Gold in the Brooks
and &s;mall Streams, as well tho&s;e they had
been at before, as others; and that after they
had, as it were, plundered them at the fir&s;t
Di&s;covery, for as they had found &s;ome Gold
after the ha&s;ty Rain, they were loth to give
it over, tho' they had been a&s;&s;ured there was
more to be found in the Lake where they
were yet to come, than in the Brooks.</P>
<P>All this while their making the Floats went
&s;lowly on, for the Men thought it a great
Hard&s;hip to keep chopping of Blocks, as they
call'd it, while their Fellows were picking up
of Gold, tho' they knew they were to have
their Share of what they found, as much as
if they had been all the while with them:
But, it &s;eems, there is a kind of Satisfaction
in the Work of picking up Gold, be&s;ides the
meer Gain.</P>
<P>However, at Length, the Gold failing, they
began to think of their more immediate
Work, which was going forward; and the
Carpenters having made Three more Floats
like flat-bottom'd Barges, which they brought
to be able to carry their Baggage and them|&s;elves
too, if they thought fit, they began
to embark and fall down the River, but they
grew &s;ick of their Navigation in a very few
Days; for before they got to the Lake, which
was but Three Days going, they run &s;everal
Times on Ground, and were oblig'd to lighten
them to get them off again, then load again,
<PB N="167" REF="380">
and lighten again, and &s;o off and on, till they
were &s;o tired of them; that they would much
rather have carried all their Baggage, and have
travelled by Land: And at la&s;t they were
forced to cast off Two of them, and put all
their Baggage on Board the other Two, which,
at be&s;t, tho' large, were but very poor crazy
Things.</P>
<P>At length, they came in Sight of their be|loved
Lake, and the next Day they entred
into the open Part or Sea of it, which they
found was very large, and in &s;ome Places
very deep.</P>
<P>Their Floats, or what they might be call'd,
were by no Means fit to carry them upon
this Inland Sea; for as, if the Water had
been &s;tirred by the lea&s;t Gu&s;t of Wind, it
would pre&s;ently have wa&s;hed over them, and
have &s;poiled, if not &s;unk, their Baggage;
&s;o they had no Way to &s;teer or guide them
whenever they came into deep Water where
they could not reach the Ground with their
Poles.</P>
<P>This oblig'd them, as &s;oon as they came into
the open Lake, to keep clo&s;e under one Shore,
<HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> to the Right-hand, where the
Land falling away to the <HI>S.</HI> and the <HI>S. and by
E.</HI> &s;eemed to carry them &s;till forward on their
Way; the other Side widening to the N. made
the Lake &s;eem there to be really a Sea, for
they could not &s;ee over it unle&s;s they went on
Shore, and got up upon &s;ome ri&s;ing Ground.</P>
<P>Here, at fir&s;t, they found the Shore &s;teep
too, and a great Depth of Water clo&s;e to the
Land, which made them very unea&s;y; for if
<PB N="168" REF="381">
the lea&s;t Gale of Wind had di&s;turbed the Wa|ter,
e&s;pecially blowing from off the Lake, they
would have been &s;hipwreck'd clo&s;e to the Shore.
However, after they had gone for Two Days
along the Side, by the Help of Towing and
Setting as well as they could, they came to
a flatter Shore and a fair Strand, to their great
Joy and Satisfaction.</P>
<P>But if the Shore prov'd to their Satisfacti|on
for its Safety, it was much more so on ano|ther
Account, for they had not been long here,
before they found the Sands or Shore infinitely
rich in Gold, beyond all they had &s;een, or
thought of &s;eeing, before. They had no &s;oon|er
made the Di&s;covery, but they re&s;olv'd to
fall on, as upon a la&s;ting Spoil that was to
inrich them all, and they went to work with
&s;uch an avaricious Rage, that they &s;eemed
to be as if they were plundring an Enemy's
Camp, and that there was an Army at Hand
to drive them from the Place; and, as it
prov'd, they were in the right to do &s;o; for
in this Gu&s;t of their greedy Appetite,
they considered not where they were, and
upon what tender tickli&s;h Terms their
Navigation &s;tood. They had indeed drawn
their Two Floats to the Shore as well as they
could, and with Pieces of Wood, like Piles,
&s;tuck in on every Side, brought them to ride
ea&s;y, but had not taken the lea&s;t Thought
about Change of Weather, tho' they knew
they had neither Anchor or Cable, nor &s;o
much as a Rope large enough to fa&s;ten them
on the Shore.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="382">
But they were taught more Wit to their
Co&s;t in Two or Three Days; for the very &s;e|cond
Night, they felt a little unu&s;ual Ri&s;ing of
the Water, as they thought, tho' without any
Wind; and the next Morning, they found
the Water of the Lake was &s;welled about Two
Foot perpendicular, and that their Floats,
by that Means, lay a great Way farther
from the Shore than they did before, the Wa|ter
&s;till increa&s;ing.</P>
<P>This made them, at fir&s;t, imagine there
was a Tide in the Lake, and that after a lit|tle
Time it would abate again; but they &s;oon
found their Mi&s;take; for, after &s;ome Time,
they perceived the Water, which was perfect|ly
fine and clear before, grew, by Degrees, of
a paler Colour, thick, and whiti&s;h, till at
la&s;t it was quite white and muddy, as is u&s;u|al
in Land Floods $ and as it &s;till continued
ri&s;ing, &s;o they continued thru&s;ting in their
Floats farther and farther towards the Shore,
till they had, in &s;hort, lo&s;t all the fine Gol|den
Sands they were upon before, and found
the Lake overflowed the Land &s;o far beyond
them, that, in &s;hort, they &s;eemed to be in
the Middle of the Lake, for they could &s;carce
&s;ee to the End of the Water, even on that
very Side where, but a few Hours before,
they were fa&s;t on Shore.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily judge, that this put them
into a great Con&s;ternation, and they might
well conclude, that they &s;hould be all drown|ed
and lo&s;t; for they were now, as it were,
in the Middle of the Sea upon Two open
Floats or Rafts, fenc'd no where from the
<PB N="170" REF="383">
lea&s;t Surge or Swell of the Water, except by
a kind of wa&s;te Board, about Two Foot
high, built up on the Sides, without any
Caulking or Pitching, or any Thing to keep
out the Water.</P>
<P>They had neither Ma&s;t or Sail, Anchor or
Cable, Head or Stern, no Bows to fence off
the Waves, or Rudder to &s;teer any Cour&s;e,
or Oars to give any Motion, but, like a flat|bottomed
Punt; they thru&s;t them along
with &s;uch Poles as they had, &s;ome of which
were about Eight or Ten Foot long, and,
which gave them a little Way, but very
&s;lowly.</P>
<P>All the Remedy they had in this Ca&s;e, was
to &s;et on with their Poles towards the Shore,
and to ob&s;erve by their Pocket-Compa&s;&s;es
which Way it lay: And this they laboured
hard at, le&s;t they &s;hould be lo&s;t in the Night,
and not know which Way to go.</P>
<P>Their Carpenters, in the mean Time, with
&s;ome &s;pare Boards which they had, or rather
made, rai&s;ed their Sides as well as they
could, to keep off the Wa&s;h of the Sea, if
any Wind &s;hould ri&s;e &s;o as to make the Wa|ter
rough, and thus they fenced again&s;t eve|ry
Danger as well as they could, tho' all
put together, they were but in a very &s;orry
Condition.</P>
<P>Now they had Time to reflect upon their
voracious Fury, in ranging the Shore to pick
up Gold, without con&s;idering where, and
in what Condition they were, and without
looking out on Shore for a Place of Safety: Nay
they might now have reflected on the
<PB N="171" REF="384">
Madne&s;s of venturing out into a Lake or In|land
Sea of that va&s;t Extent, in &s;uch pitiful
Bottoms as they had under them. Their Bu|&s;ine&s;s,
doubtle&s;s, had been to have &s;topp'd
within the Mouth of the River, and found
a convenient Place to land their Goods and
&s;ecure their Lives; and when they had pitched
their Camp upon any &s;afe high Ground,
where they might be &s;ure they could neither
be overflowed or &s;urrounded with Water,
they might have &s;earch'd the Shores of
the Lake as far as they thought fit; But thus
to launch out in an unknown Water, and in
&s;uch a Condition, as to their Ve&s;&s;els, as is de|&s;cribed
above, was mo&s;t unaccountably ra&s;h
and incon&s;iderate.</P>
<P>Never was a Crew of Fifty Men, all able
and experienced Sailors &s;o embarked, nor
drawn into &s;uch a Snare; for they were &s;ur|rounded
with Water for Three or Four Miles
in Breadth on the neare&s;t Shore, and this all
on a sudden, the Country lying low and flat
for &s;uch a Breadth; all which appear'd dry
Land, and Green, like the Fields, but the Day
before; and, without Que&s;tion, they were &s;uf|ficiently
&s;urprized.</P>
<P>Now they would have given all the Gold
they had got, which was very con&s;iderable
too, to have been on Shore on the wilde&s;t and
mo&s;t barren Part of the Country, and would
have tru&s;ted to their own Diligence to get
Food: But here, be&s;ides the imminent Dan|ger
of Drowning, they might al&s;o be in Dan|ger
of Starving, for had their Floats ground|ed
but upon any little Hillock, they might
<PB N="172" REF="385">
have &s;tuck there till they had &s;tarved and pe|ri&s;hed
for Hunger: Then they were in the
utmo&s;t Anxiety too, for fear of wetting their
Powder, which if it had happened, they could
never have made &s;erviceable again, and with|out
if they could not have killed any Thing
for Food, if they had got to the Shore.</P>
<P>They had, in this Exigence, &s;ome Comforts
however, which might a little uphold their
Spirits; and without which, indeed, their
Condition mu&s;t have been deplorable and de|&s;perate.
1. It was hot Weather, &s;o that, as
they had no Shelter again&s;t the Cold if it had
come, they had no Cold to afflict them;
but they rather wanted Aunings, to keep off the
Sun, than Hou&s;es to keep off the Cold. 2.
The Water of the Lake was all fre&s;h and ve|ry
good, even when it looked white and thick,
yet it was very &s;weet and drank whole&s;ome
and good ta&s;ted: Had it been &s;alt Water,
and they thus in the Middle of it, they mu&s;t
have peri&s;hed for Thir&s;t. 3. They being now
floating over the drowned Lands only, the
Water was not very deep, &s;o that they could
reach Ground, and &s;et along their Rafts with
their Poles; and this, to be &s;ure, they failed
not to do with the utmo&s;t Diligence.</P>
<P>They had al&s;o the Satisfaction to ob&s;erve,
tho' it was not without Toiling in an inex|pre&s;&s;ible
Manner, that they did gain upon
the Shore; and there was a high Land be|fore
them, which they did draw towards, tho'
very &s;lowly, and at a very great Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>But then they had another Di&s;couragement,
namely, that they &s;aw the Day declined, and
<PB N="173" REF="386">
Night came on apace, and, in &s;hort, that it
was impo&s;&s;ible they could reach the high Land,
which they &s;aw, by Daylight, nor did they
know what to do, or how to go on in the Night.</P>
<P>At Length, Two bold Fellows offered
them&s;elves to &s;trip and go off, either to wade
or &s;wim to the Shore, which they had yet
Daylight enough to do, being, as they judged,
about Three Miles, tho' they found it above
Four Miles; and from thence to find Means
to make a Fire or Light, to guide them to
the Shore in the Dark.</P>
<P>This was, indeed, a de&s;perate Attempt,
but the Two Fellows being good Swimmers,
and willing to venture, it was not impracti|cable.
They had light Linnen Drawers on,
open at the Knees, and their Shirts; and they
took a little Bottle each in their Pockets, with
&s;ome Gun-powder in them clo&s;e &s;topped, with
other Materials for kindling Fire; Weapons
they had none, but each Man a Knife and a
Hatchet fa&s;ten'd round their Wa&s;te in a lit|tle
Belt, and a light Pole in their Hands to
help when they waded, which they expected
to do mo&s;t Part of the Way. They had no
Provi&s;ions with them, but a Bottle with &s;ome
good Brandy in their Pockets.</P>
<P>When they went off, you are to &s;uppo&s;e
the Water about Four Foot to Five Foot
deep, &s;o they cho&s;e to &s;wim rather than wade,
and, as it was very &s;eldom much deeper, they
had often Opportunity to &s;tand on the firm
Ground to re&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In this Po&s;ture they went on directly to|wards
the Land, and after they had by &s;wim|ming
<PB N="174" REF="387">
and wading together, advanced about
a Mile, they found the Water grew &s;hallower
which was a Signal to them that they &s;hould
reach the hard Ground in a little Time; &s;o
they walked chearfully on in about Three
Foot Water for near a Mile more.</P>
<P>Their Companions &s;oon lo&s;t Sight of them,
for they being in White, and the Water white
too, and the Light declining, they could not
&s;ee them at a Mile's Di&s;tance; after this, they
found the Ground falling lower, &s;o that they
had deeper Water, for Half a Mile more
all the Way; after which, they came to flat
Ground again for near Two Miles more, and
at length to the dry Land, to their great Sa|ti&s;faction,
tho' it was then quite Night.</P>
<P>Their Comrades had been near an Hour in
the Dark, that is to &s;ay, with only a dusky
Light, and began to be greatly at a Lo&s;s, not
being able to &s;ee the Compa&s;s, they had made
&s;hift to get over the Half-Mile of deeper
Water pretty well, for tho' it was too deep
for the Men to wade, as above, yet they could
reach the Bottom with their Poles, and at that
Time they happened to feel a little Breeze of
Wind fair in their Way, which both refre&s;hed
them with its cool Breath, and al&s;o gave them
a Kind of a Jog on their Way towards the
Shore.</P>
<P>At Length, to their great Joy, they &s;aw a
Light; and it was the more to their Joy, be|cau&s;e
they &s;aw it ju&s;t before them, or, as the
Seamen call it, Right a Head; by which they
had the Satisfaction to know they had not
varied their Cour&s;e in the Dark. It &s;eems
<PB N="175" REF="388">
their Two Men had landed upon a fair ri&s;ing
Ground, where they found &s;ome low Bu&s;hes
and Trees, and where they had good hard
dry Standings; and they &s;oon found Means to
pick out a few withered dry Sticks, with
which they made a Blaze for the pre&s;ent,
having &s;truck Fire with the Tools they were
furni&s;hed with, as above.</P>
<P>By the Light of this Blaze, they gave the
fir&s;t Notice to their Comrades, as above, that
they were landed, and they again, as was
agreed before Hand, fired Two Guns as a
Signal that they &s;aw it, and were all &s;afe;
al&s;o, by the Light of this Fire, they gave
them&s;elves &s;o much Light as to find more dry
Wood; and afterwards their Fire was &s;o
&s;trong and good, that they made the green
Wood burn as well as the dry.</P>
<P>Their Companions were now come into the
&s;hoal Water, in which, as I &s;aid, the Men
waded, but as their Floats did not draw above
a Foot or Eighteen Inches Water at mo&s;t,
they went on &s;till; but at length, being
within about Half a Mile of the Hillock,
where the Two Men were, they found the
Water &s;o &s;hallow, that their Floats would not
&s;wim. Upon this, more of the Men went
over-board with Poles in their Hands, &s;ound|ing,
as we may call it, for deeper Water;
and, with long Puddling about, they found
the Ground fall off a little in One Place, by
which they got their Floats about a Quarter
of a Mile farther: But then the Water was
&s;hallow again not above a Foot Water. So,
in a Word, they were fain to be content, and
<PB N="176" REF="389">
running fa&s;t a-Ground, they immediately
began, tho' dark, and them&s;elves very much
fatigued, to unload their Ships; and carry
all on Shore on their Backs.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing they took Care to land,
was their Ammunition, their Gun-powder and
Arms; not forgetting the <HI>Ammunition de
Bouche,</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> call it, I mean their
Victuals; and, with great Joy, they got to
their Two Comrades; then they fetched their
proper Materials for their Tent, and &s;et it up,
and having refre&s;hed them&s;elves, they went
all to &s;leep (as they &s;aid) without &s;o much
as a Centinel placed for their Guard: For as
they &s;aw no Inhabitants, &s;o they feared no
Enemies; and, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed they were
weary enough to make them want Re&s;t, even
in the extreame&s;t Manner.</P>
<P>In the Morning they had Time enough to
reflect upon the Madne&s;s of &s;uch ra&s;h Adven|tures,
as you &s;hall hear: Their Floats, indeed,
remained as they had left them, and the Wa|ter
was ebbed away from them above Two
Miles, that is to &s;ay, almo&s;t to the deep Half-Mile,
mentioned above, but they heard a
&s;urprizing Noi&s;e and Roaring of the Water
on the Lake it&s;elf, the Body of which was
now above Seven Miles from them.</P>
<P>They could not imagine what this Roar|ing
&s;hould mean, for they felt no Wind, nor
could they perceive any Clouds at a Di|&s;tance
that looked as if they brought any
Squawls of Wind with them, as they are of|ten
ob&s;erved to do: But when they came
nearer the Water, they &s;ound it had a Kind
<PB N="177" REF="390">
of a Swell, and that there was certainly &s;ome
more violent Motion at the farther Di&s;tance;
and in a little while, looking behind them to|wards
the Shore where their Comrades were,
they found the Water began to &s;pread over
the flat Ground again, upon which, they
ha&s;ten'd back, but having a good Way to go,
they were obliged to go Knee-deep, before
they reached to the Hillock where their Tent
&s;tood.</P>
<P>They had not been many Hours on Shore,
before they found the Wind began to ri&s;e, and
the Roaring, which before they heard at a
Di&s;tance, grew louder and nearer, till at
length the Floats were lifted up, and driven
on Shore, by the Wind, which increa&s;ed to a
Storm; and the Water &s;welled and grew rough,
and, as they were upon the Lee Shore, the
Floats were &s;oon broken in Pieces, and went
&s;ome one Way and &s;ome another.</P>
<P>In the Evening, it overca&s;t and grew cloudy,
and about Midnight they had their Share of
a violent Rain, which yet, they could &s;ee,
was more violent towards the Mountains of
the <HI>Andes,</HI> and towards the Cour&s;e of the
River, which they came down in the Floats.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence of this, was naturally,
that, the Third Day, the Waters of the Lake
&s;welled again to a frightful Height, that is to
&s;ay, it would have been frightful to them, if
they had been upon it, for they &s;uppo&s;e it
ro&s;e about Two Fathom perpendicular, and
the Wind continuing fre&s;h, the Water was all
a white Foam of Froth; &s;o, that had they had a
<PB N="178" REF="391">
good large Boat under them, &s;he would &s;carce
have lived there.</P>
<P>Their Tent kept them dry, and as they
were on dry Land, and too high to be reached
by any Inundation, they had no Concern up|on
them about their Safety: But, to be &s;ure,
took this for &s;ufficient Notice, not to come
up the Lake again in Ha&s;te, unle&s;s they were
better provided with Boats to ride out a
Storm.</P>
<P>Our Men began now to think they had
taken their Leave of the Golden Lake, and
yet they knew not how to think of leaving
it &s;o &s;oon: They were now Fourteen or Fif|teen
Leagues off of that fine Golden Shore
where they took up &s;o much, nor did they
know the Way to it by Land, and as for go|ing
by Water, that they were unprovided for,
&s;everal Ways; be&s;ides, the Waters kept up to
a con&s;iderable Height, and the Winds blew
fre&s;h for Six or Eight Days together.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Ob&s;trctuions joyn'd together,
put them upon con&s;idering of per&s;uing their
March by Land; in which, however, they
re&s;olved to coa&s;t the Lake as near as they
could to the Ea&s;tward, till, if po&s;&s;ible, they
&s;hould find that the Waters had &s;ome Outlet,
that is to &s;ay, that the Lake emptied it&s;elf
by &s;ome River towards the Sea, as they con|cluded
it certainly mu&s;t.</P>
<P>They had not yet &s;een any Inhabitants, or
any Sign of them, at lea&s;t, not near them;
they did, or 'tis thought they fancied they
did, &s;ee &s;ome on the other Side of the River,
but they would not come within Reach of
<PB N="179" REF="392">
them on any Account, &s;o that 'tis doubtful
whether they really &s;aw them or no.</P>
<P>Before they decamped for a March, it was
needful to get &s;ome Provisions, if po&s;&s;ible,
and this made them the more de&s;irous of
finding out &s;ome conver&s;ible Creatures, but it
was in vain: They killed a wild Cow and a
Deer, and this was all they could get for &s;ome
Time; and with this they &s;et forward, taking
their Cour&s;e Ea&s;t, and rather Northerly, in or|der
to come into the &s;ame Latitude they &s;et out
in, at their fir&s;t embarking on the River.</P>
<P>After they had marched thus for about Three
Days, keeping the Lake on the North Side of
them, and always in View, at length, on the
third Day in the Evening, coming to a little
Hill, which gave them the Pro&s;pect of the
Country for &s;ome Length <HI>N. E.</HI> they &s;aw
plainly a River i&s;&s;uing out of the Lake, and
running fir&s;t Ea&s;t, then bending to the South,
it was al&s;o ea&s;y to perceive, that this River
was at that Time much broader than in its
u&s;ual Cour&s;e, for that they could &s;ee a great
many Trees, which probably grew on the
Bank of the River, &s;tanding, as it were, in
the Middle of the Water, the Banks being
overflowed both Ways very con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>But as they mounted the Hill, which they
&s;tood on, to a greater Height, they di&s;cover'd
farther North, at the Di&s;tance of Five or Six
Miles, according to their Account, a much larg|er
River, which looked, compared to the fir&s;t
River, rather like a Sea than a River, which
likewi&s;e i&s;&s;ued out of the Lake and run <HI>E.</HI>
by <HI>S.</HI> towards the Sea; which River they &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="180" REF="393">
to be in the &s;ame Manner &s;welled with
a Land-Water, or Fre&s;h, as the Lake was, to a
prodigious Degree.</P>
<P>This Pro&s;pect brought them to a more &s;e|rious
Con&s;ultation, as to the Mea&s;ures they
&s;hould take to proceed on their Journey; and,
as they could ea&s;ily &s;ee, there was little or no
U&s;e to be made of the Rivers for their Tra|velling,
while the Water was thus above the
ordinary Banks, &s;o that they could not know
the proper Channels, and al&s;o that the Currents
were exceeding &s;wift; &s;o they re&s;olved to
&s;tock them&s;elves with Provi&s;ions, if po&s;&s;ible,
and continue their Journey by Land.</P>
<P>To this Purpo&s;e, they fir&s;t made it their
Bu&s;ine&s;s to catch &s;ome more <HI>Guinacos,</HI>
or large Sheep, which they knew, would not
only feed them, but al&s;o carry their Luggage,
which was &s;till heavy and very trouble&s;ome
to them, and yet ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary too:
But all their Endeavour was in vain, for tho'
they &s;aw &s;everal, and found that the Country
was pretty full of them, and &s;ome they kil|led,
yet they could not take One alive,
(which was the Thing they chiefly wanted)
by any Means that they could contrive.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of the Creatures they &s;hot
for Food, they very often found wild Cows
and Bulls, and e&s;pecially, as they found af|terwards,
on the North Side of the River;
but the mo&s;t &s;urprizing Thing to them that
they had yet met with, was &s;till to come:
They had de&s;cended from the Hill,
where they at fir&s;t di&s;cover'd the &s;maller
River, and where they had &s;et up their Tent,
<PB N="181" REF="394">
re&s;olving to march on the lower Grounds, as
near the River as they could, &s;o as to be out
of Danger of the Water, that they might find,
if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome Way over to come at the
great River, which they judg'd to be the
Stream mo&s;t proper for their Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Here they found a rich plea&s;ant Country,
level and fruitful, not &s;o low as to be expo&s;ed
to the overflowing of the River; and not &s;o
high as to be dry and barren; &s;everal little
Brooks and Streams of Water, ri&s;ing on the
Side of the Hill they came from, ran wind|ing
this Way and that, as if to find out the
River, and near the River were &s;ome Woods of
very large Trees.</P>
<P>The Men, not forgetting the main Chance,
fell to wa&s;hing and &s;earching the Sand and
Gravel in the&s;e Brooks for Gold; but the
Harve&s;t of Gold &s;eemed to be over, for here
they found none. They had al&s;o an Occa&s;ion
to di&s;cover, that till the Land-Waters were
abated, there was no &s;tirring for them, no, not
&s;o much as to cro&s;s the fir&s;t River, nor, if
they did, could they find in their Hearts to
venture, not knowing, but the Waters might
&s;till ri&s;e higher, and that the Two Rivers
might &s;well into One, and &s;o they &s;hould be
&s;wallowed up, or if not, they might be &s;ur|rounded
in &s;ome i&s;land, where they &s;hould
peri&s;h for want of Provi&s;ions; &s;o they re|&s;olved
to fetch their Baggage from the Hill, as
well as they could, and encamp in tho&s;e plea|&s;ant
Plains, as near the River as they could,
till the Water &s;hould abate.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="395">
While they &s;tay'd here, they were &s;o far
from having Hopes that the Waters would
abate, that it rained violently for almo&s;t Three
Days and Nights together; and one of tho&s;e
rainy Mornings, looking out at their Tent-Door,
(for they could not &s;tir abroad for the
Rain) they were &s;urprized, when looking to|wards
the River, which was ju&s;t below them,
they &s;aw a prodigious Number of black Crea|tures
in the Water, and &s;wimming towards
the Shore where their were.</P>
<P>They fir&s;t imagined they were Porpu&s;&s;es,
but could not &s;ugge&s;t any Thing of that Kind
at &s;uch a Di&s;tance from the Sea, when one of
the Men, looking at them through a Gla&s;s,
cried out, they were all black Cattle, and
that he could perceive their Horns and their
Heads; upon this, others looking with their
Gla&s;&s;es al&s;o, &s;aid the &s;ame, immediately, eve|ry
Man run to his Gun, and, notwith&s;tanding
it rained hard, away they march'd down to
the River's Side with all the Speed they could
make.</P>
<P>By that Time they reach'd the River-Bank,
their Wonder incra&s;ed, for they found it was
a va&s;t Multitude of black Cattle, who find|ing
the Waters ri&s;e between the Two Rivers,
and, by a natural Sagacity, apprehen&s;ive of
being &s;wept away with the Flood, had, One
and All, took the Waters, and were &s;wimming
over to this Side for Safety.</P>
<P>You may very well &s;uppo&s;e, the Fellows,
tho' they wanted a few &s;uch Gue&s;ts the&s;e,
yet were terrified with their Multitude, and
began to con&s;ider what Cour&s;e to take when
<PB N="183" REF="396">
the Creatures &s;hould come to land, for there
was a mon&s;trous many of them: Upon the
whole, after a &s;hort Con&s;ultation, for the
Creatures came on apace, they re&s;olved to get
into a low Ground, where, they perceived,
they directed their Cour&s;e, and, in which,
there were a great many Trees, and that they
would all get up into the Trees, and &s;o lie
ready to &s;hoot among them as they land|ed.</P>
<P>Accordingly they did &s;o, except that Five of
them, cutting down &s;ome large Boughs of a
Tree, got into a little Thicket clo&s;e to the Wa|ter,
which they &s;o fortified with the Boughs of
the Trees, that they thought them&s;elves &s;e|cure
within, and there they po&s;ted them&s;elves,
re&s;olving to expect them and take their Ha|zard.</P>
<P>When the Creatures came to land, it was wonderful to ob&s;erve, how they lowed and
roared, as it were, to bid one another wel|come
on Shore, and &s;preading them&s;elves up|on
the neighbouring Plain, immediately lay
down, and rowling and &s;tretching them&s;elves,
gave our People Notice, that, in &s;hort, they
had &s;wam a great Way, and were very much
tired.</P>
<P>Our Fellows, you may &s;uppo&s;e, laid about
them, and the Five Men that fixed them|&s;elves
in the Thicket, had the faire&s;t Oppor|tunity,
for they killed Eleven or Twelve of
them as &s;oon as they &s;et their Foot on Shore,
and lamed as many.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="397">
And now they had a Tryal of Skill, for as
they kill'd as many as they knew what to do
with, and had their Choice of Beef, if they
kill'd a Bull, they let him lie, as having no
U&s;e for him, but cho&s;e the Cows, as what
they thought was only fit for Eating.</P>
<P>But, I &s;ay, now they had a Tryal of Skill,
namely, to &s;ee if they could maim &s;ome of
them, &s;o as not to kill them, and might bring
them to carry their Luggage: This was a Kind
of a fruitle&s;s Attempt, as we afterwards told
them, to make a Baggage-Hor&s;e of a wild
Bull.</P>
<P>However, they brought it &s;o far to pa&s;s,
that having wounded &s;everal young Bulls ve|ry
much, after they had run roaring about
with the Hurt, they lay down and bled &s;o,
as, that it was likely, they would bleed to
Death, as &s;everal of them really did; but the
Surgeon ob&s;erving Two of them to be low e|nough
that he might go to them, and do what
he would with them, he &s;oon &s;topped the
Bleeding, and, in a Word, healed the Wounds;
all the while he was doing this, he cau&s;ed
Food, that is to &s;ay, Gra&s;s and Boughs of
Trees to be brought to them for Food, and in
Four or Five Days, the Creatures were very
well: Then he cau&s;ed them to be hamper'd
with Ropes and tied together, &s;o that they
could neither &s;ight with their Heads or run
away with their Heels; and having thus
brought them to a Place ju&s;t by their Tent,
he cau&s;ed them to be kept &s;o hungry, and al|mo&s;t
&s;tcrved, that when Meat was carried
them, they were &s;o tame and thankful, that,
<PB N="185" REF="398">
at la&s;t, they would eat oat of his Hand, an
&s;tretch out their Heads for it, and when they
were let a little loo&s;er, would follow him a|bout
for a Handful of Gra&s;s, like a Dog for
a Bone.</P>
<P>When he had brought them thus to Hand,
he, by Degrees, loaded them, and, taught
them to carry, and if they were unruly
as they were at fir&s;t, he would load them with
more than they could well carry, and make
them &s;tand under that Load Two or Three
Hours, and then come him&s;elf and bring
them Meat, and take the Load off; and thus
in a few Days, they knew him &s;o well, that
they would let him do any thing with them.</P>
<P>When they came to decamp, they tied them
both together, with &s;uch Ropes as they had,
and made them carry a very great Weight.
They tried the &s;ame Experiment with Two
more, but they failed, one died, and the
other prov'd untractable, &s;ullen and outragi|ous.</P>
<P>They had now lain here Twelve Days,
having Plenty of Provi&s;ion, in which Time the
Weather proving fair, the Land-Waters run off
and the Rivers came to their old Channels,
clear and calm: The Men would gladly have
gone back to the Sands and flat Shore of the
Lake, or to &s;ome other Part to look for Gold;
but that was impracticable now, &s;o they
march'd on, and in about Two Days, they found
the fir&s;t River &s;eemed to turn &s;o much to the
<HI>South,</HI> that they thought it would carry them
too far out of their Way, for their Orders
were to keep about the Latitude of Forty to
<PB N="186" REF="399">
Fifty Degrees, as is &s;aid before, &s;o they re&s;olved
to get over the fir&s;t River as &s;oon as they could;
they had not gone far, but they found the
River &s;o &s;hallow, that they ea&s;ily forded it,
Bulls and all, and being &s;afely landed, they
travelled cro&s;s the Country directly to the
great River, which they found al&s;o very low,
tho' not like to be forded as the other was.</P>
<P>Now, they thought, they were in the Way
of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and here they re&s;olved to
&s;ee if a Tree or Two might be found, big
enough, to make a large Canoe to carry them
down this River, which, as it &s;eemed large,
&s;o the Current &s;eemed to be le&s;s rapid and fu|rous,
the Channel being deep and full.</P>
<P>They had not &s;earched long, but they found
Three Trees, as they thought, large enough,
and they immediately went to work with
them, fell'd them, and &s;hap'd them, and
in Four Days Time, they had Three hand|&s;ome
Canoes; one larger then the re&s;t, and
able to carry, in all, Fifteen or Sixteen Men;
but this was not enough, &s;o they were forced
to look out farther for Two Trees more, and
this took them up more Time. However, in
about a Week they launched them all: As for
Days, they had lo&s;t their Account of Time;
&s;o that as they had, &s;ometimes, no Room to
di&s;tingui&s;h one Day from another, &s;o they,
after &s;ome Time, quite forgot the Days, and
knew not a Sunday from a Working-Day
any more.</P>
<P>While the&s;e Canoes were making, the Men,
according to the old Trade, fell to rummag|ing
the Shores of this River, as they had
<PB N="187" REF="400">
done the other, for Gold, nor did they whol|ly
lo&s;e their Labour, for in &s;everal Places
they found a pretty deal; and here it was,
that a certain Number of them, taking one
of the Canoes that were fir&s;t made, took a
Voyage of their own Heads, not only with|out
Command, but again&s;t Command; and
having inade a little Ma&s;t and Sail to it, went
up towards the Lake, re&s;olving to go quite
into the Lake, to find another Golden Shore
or <HI>Gold Coa&s;t,</HI> as they call'd it.</P>
<P>To give a particular Account of this wild Un|dertaking,
would be too long, nor would the
Rogues give much Account of it them&s;elves;
only, in &s;hort, that they found a Sand pretty
rich in Gold, work'd upon it Five Days, inde|fatigably,
and got a good deal, &s;uffcient, had,
they brought it back, to have tempted the re&s;t
to have gone all away to the &s;ame Place: But
at the End of Five Days, &s;ome were for return|ing,
and others for &s;taying longer, till the Majo|rity
prevailed to come back, repre&s;enting to the
re&s;t, that their Friends would be gone, and
they &s;hould be left to &s;tarve in that wild
Country, and &s;hould never get home; &s;o
they all got into the Canoe again, but quar|relled
when they were in, and that, to
&s;uch an unrea&s;onable Height, that, in &s;hort,
they fought, over-&s;et the Boat, lo&s;t all their
Gold and their Arms, except three Muskets
which were la&s;hed under the Thouts or
Benches of the Canoe, &s;poiled their Ammu|nition
and Provi&s;ion, and drowned one of
their Company, &s;o they came home to the
<PB N="188" REF="401">
re&s;t by weeping Cro&s;s, wet and almo&s;t fa|mi&s;hed.</P>
<P>This was a Balk to them, you may be &s;ure,
and put a Damp to their new Projects; and
yet, Six of the &s;ame Men were &s;o bold after|wards,
as to demand to be di&s;mi&s;'d, and a Ca|noe
given them, and they would go back,
they &s;aid, to the Golden Lake, where, they
did not doubt, they &s;hould load the Canoe
with Gold; and if they found, when they
came back, we were gone, they would find
their Way back thro' the Mountains, and go
to the rich <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who, they did not doubt,
would get them Licen&s;e to go back to <HI>Europe</HI>
with the Galleons, and, perhaps, they &s;aid,
they might be in <HI>England</HI> before us.</P>
<P>But the Captain quelled this Mutiny, tho'
there were Four or Five more come into it,
and &s;hewing them the Agreement they had
made with me, their Commander; the Obli|gation
they were under, and the Madne&s;s of
their other Propo&s;al, prevailed with them to go
forward with the re&s;t, and pur&s;ue the Voyage,
which he now repre&s;ented to be very ea&s;y,
being, <HI>as it were,</HI> all the Way down Hill,
that is to &s;ay, with the Stream, for they all
knew the River they were in mu&s;t go to the Sea,
and that, in or near, the Latitude which they
knew the Ship had appointed to wait for them.
However, to &s;often them a little, and, in
&s;ome Mea&s;ure, to plea&s;e them, he promi&s;ed,
that, if they met with any Succe&s;s in the
Search after Gold, in the River they were in,
as he did not que&s;tion but they &s;hould, he
would con&s;ent to any rea&s;onable Stop that
<PB N="189" REF="402">
they &s;hould propo&s;e, not exceeding Five Days
in a Place, and the Places to be not le&s;s than
Five Leagues off from one another.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Terms they con&s;ented, and all
embarked and came away, tho' extreamly
mortified for the lo&s;s of one of their Compa|nions,
who was a brave &s;tout Fellow, very
well beloved by all the Company, but there
was no Remedy; &s;o they came on in Five
Canoes, and with a good Stock of Provi&s;ions,
&s;uch as it was, (<HI>viz.</HI>) good fre&s;h Beef cured in
the Sun, and Fifteen <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep alive,
for when they got into the Country, between
the Two Rivers, they found it ea&s;y to catch
tho&s;e Creatures, who, before that, would not
come near them.</P>
<P>And now they came down the River apace,
till they came to another Golden Shore, where,
finding &s;ome Quantity of Gold, they claim'd
their Captain's Promi&s;e, and accordingly,
they went all on Shore to work, and pretty
good Succe&s;s they had, picking up, from a|mong
the Sands, a considerable Quantity of
Gold; and having &s;tay'd Four of the Five
Days, they found they had cleared the Place,
which was not of a long Extent, and &s;o they
chearfully came on.</P>
<P>They came on now for Eleven Days toge|ther
very willingly, but then found the Chan|nel
of the River divided it&s;elf, and one went
away to the left, and the other to the right;
they could not judge which was the be&s;t to
take; but not que&s;tioning, but that they
would meet again &s;oon, they took the South|mo&s;t
Channel, as being mo&s;t direct in their
<PB N="190" REF="403">
Latitude; and thus they proceeded for Three
or Four Days more, when they were oblig'd
to put into the Mouth of a little River, that
fell into the other, and made a good Harbour
for their little Fleet.</P>
<P>Here, I &s;ay, they were obliged to put in
for want of Provi&s;ions, for they had eat up
all their <HI>Guinacoes,</HI> and their Two tame
Bulls too, the la&s;t of which, they &s;oon repent|ed,
as you will &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>After they had been a Hunting, and &s;hot
a couple of Deer and a Cow, with a Kind of
a Hare, as big as an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fox, they &s;et for|ward
again very merry, and the more, becau&s;e
they had another little Piece of a Gold Coa&s;t,
where, for Two Days, they had very good
Luck again; but judge how they were &s;ur|prized,
and in what a Con&s;ternation they
were, when coming down farther the &s;ame
River, they heard a terrible Noi&s;e in the Ri|ver,
as of a mighty Cataract, or Water-fall,
which increa&s;ed as they came forward, till it
grew &s;o loud, that they could not hear them|&s;elves
&s;peak, much le&s;s hear one another.</P>
<P>As they approached, it was the more fright|ful;
&s;o at length, le&s;t they &s;hould be hurried
into it before they were aware, they went all
on Shore, doing all by Signs and dumb Po|&s;tures,
for it was impo&s;&s;ible to hear any
Sound.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, it was near Six Miles
to the Place, which, when they perceived,
&s;ome of them went back to bring on the
Boats, and &s;o brought them as near the Place
as they dur&s;t, and run them on Shore into a
<PB N="191" REF="404">
little hollow Part of the Bank, ju&s;t big enough
to hold them: When they had thus &s;ecured the
Boats, they went to view the Water-fall;
but, how was they a&s;toni&s;hed? when they
found, that there were not One, but Five Wa|falls,
at the Di&s;tance of about Two Miles
from one another, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s, that
the Water fell a prodigious Height; &s;o that
it was impo&s;&s;ible any Boat could bear to
launch down the Cataract and not be da&s;hed
in Pieces.</P>
<P>They now &s;aw there was ho Remedy, but
that they mu&s;t lo&s;e the Benefit of their Five
Canoes, which had been &s;o comfortable to
them, and by which, they had come above
Four Hundred Miles in a little Time, with
Safety and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The&s;e Cataracts made the River perfectly
u&s;ele&s;s to them for above Twenty Miles, and
it was impo&s;&s;ible to drag their Canoes that
Length over Land, &s;o in &s;hort, they unload|ed
them, and for their own Satisfaction, they
turned one, the bigge&s;t, of them a-drift, and
let it go to the fir&s;t Cataract, placing them|&s;elves
&s;o beyond, that they might &s;ee it come
down, which they did, and had the Plea&s;ure
of &s;eeing it da&s;hed in Pieces on the Rocks
below.</P>
<P>Well, there was no Remedy, but they mu&s;t
leave their Boats behind them; and now, as
I have &s;aid, they had Time to repent killing
their Two tame Bulls, who would have done
them good Service; but it was too late to
look back upon what was done and over, &s;o
many Days before; they had now no Reme|dy,
<PB N="192" REF="405">
if they would go forward, but to take
up their Baggage upon their Shoulders, and
walk on Foot; the only Help they had, was,
that they had gotten Five <HI>Guinacoes</HI> more,
which, tho' they were hungry, and would fain
have eaten, yet, as they carried, at lea&s;t, Five
Hundred Weight of their Luggage, they cho&s;e
to fa&s;t and walk, rather than fea&s;t and work;
&s;o they went on as well as they could, till they
got pa&s;t the&s;e Falls, which, tho' not above
Twenty Miles, co&s;t them Five Days La|bour.</P>
<P>Then they encamped again to refre&s;h, them|&s;elves,
and con&s;ider of what was next to be
done: They were thus long upon this &s;hort
Journey for many Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>1. Becau&s;e they were obliged to employ the
be&s;t Part of Two Days in Hunting for their
Food, in which Time, Five of them &s;wim|ing
over the River to &s;hoot at &s;ome black
Cattle, extreamly fatigued them&s;elves in pur|&s;uing
them, but did, however, &s;hoot Five
Cows and Bulls; but then it was at &s;uch a
Di&s;tance, that it was more Pains to drag the
Fle&s;h along to the River's Side, than it was
worth to have it, only, that they were, in|deed
hunger-&s;tarved, and mu&s;t have it.</P>
<P>2. They found &s;till &s;ome little Quantity of
Gold in the Water, that is to &s;ay, below the
Falls, where the Water, after, by falling with
&s;uch Force, it had made a Pit or Hole of a
va&s;t Depth, as is u&s;ual at a Mill-Tail, had
thrown up a Shoal again, at, perhaps, a Mile
Di&s;tance, there they took up &s;ome Gold,
<PB N="193" REF="406">
whenever the Water was low enough to come
to the Shoal.</P>
<P>3. The Weight of their Baggage made
them travel heavy, and &s;eldom above Five
or Six Miles a Day.</P>
<P>Being now come to the open River, they
thought of building more Floats, but they
were di&s;couraged from this Con&s;ideration;
That they did not know, but in few Days
March, there might be more Water-falls, and
then all their Labour would be lo&s;t; &s;o they
took up their Tent, and began to travel
again.</P>
<P>But here, as they kept the River clo&s;e on
Board, as the Seamen call it, they were at a
full Stop, by the coming in of another River
from the <HI>S. W.</HI> which, when it joined, the Ri|ver
they went along by, was above a Quarter of
a Mile broad, and how to get over it they knew
not; they &s;ent Two Men up the additional
River &s;ome Length, and he brought Word,
that it was, indeed, narrower by much, but
no where fordable, but deep and rapid.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time, they &s;ent Two more
nimble Fellows down the Coa&s;t of the great
River, to &s;ee if there were no more Water|falls,
who brought them Word, there were
none for Sixty Miles.</P>
<P>While they lay here, at the Point of the
Influx, expecting the Return of their Scouts,
they u&s;ed what Diligence they could in get|ting
Provi&s;ions; and among the re&s;t, they
killed Three Cows and a Bull on the other Side
of the bigge&s;t River; but not knowing how to
bring them over, they concluded to go over, as
<PB N="194" REF="407">
many as could &s;wim, which was the better
Half of them, and &s;it down by it, and roa&s;t
and broil upon the Spot, as much as they could
eat, and then bring over as much as they
could for their Fellows.</P>
<P>They got Boughs of Trees, and bound
them together, then wrapt the Meat in the
Hides, and laid it on the Wood, and made
a Hundred little Contrivances to get it over;
&s;o that on one Side or other, they got all the
Meat eaten or brought over: what they got on
their own Side the River, they made better
&s;hift with.</P>
<P>On the Return of their Scouts, they found
there was no Remedy, but to build &s;ome new
Ve&s;&s;els of one Kind or another, to take in
Their Baggage and Provi&s;ion which they did,
after the Manner of their fir&s;t Floats; for
they found no Trees big enough to make Ca|noes;
when therefore, they had made one
great Float, they re&s;olved to make Two &s;mall
Boats like Yauls or Skiffs, with which they
might tow their large Float or Barge; and as
this they might do with &s;mall Stuff, &s;o they
found Means to line them within and without
with the Bulls Hides, and that, &s;o dextrou&s;|ly
joined, and lapped or rolled one over ano|ther,
that no Water came thro', or but very
little.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Two Boats, they ferried over
the &s;mall Rivers with Ea&s;e, each Boat carry|ing
Six Men, be&s;ides Two to row; and when
they were over the &s;mall Rivers, the Two
Boats &s;erved to tow their great Punt or Barge
clo&s;e by the Shore.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="408">
The greate&s;t Difficulty was for Tow-Lines
to draw the Boats by, and that they &s;uppli|ed,
by twi&s;ting a &s;trong tough Kind of Flag
or Ru&s;h, which they found in the River, of
which, with great Application, they made a
Kind of Rope-yarn, and then twi&s;ting it
again, made it very &s;trong.</P>
<P>This was the Voiture with which they car|ried
them&s;elves down quite to the Sea, and
one of the&s;e Boats it was, that we &s;pyed, <HI>as
above,</HI> coming to us in the Bay.</P>
<P>They had yet above Four Hundred and
Fifty Miles to the Sea, nor could they at any
Time tell or gue&s;s how far off it might be. They
went on more or le&s;s every Day, but 'twas
but &s;lowly, and not without great Labour,
both of Rowing and Towing: Their Provi|&s;ions
al&s;o co&s;t them much Labour, and it was
a great deal of Difficulty, that they were
obliged, fir&s;t to hunt and kill it, and then to
bring it to the Camp, which was always clo&s;e
to the River's Side.</P>
<P>After they had travelled thus &s;ome Time,
following the Cour&s;e of the River, behold
they came to a Place, where, of a &s;udden,
they could &s;ee no farther Bank of the River,
but it looked all Water like the Sea; they
could not imagine what it mu&s;t be, &s;o, the
next Day, they rowed towards it with one of
their little Boats, when they were &s;urprized,
to find that it was the Northern Branch of the
River, which they had &s;een go off before they
came at the Water-falls, which River being
now increa&s;ed with many other great Waters,
was now &s;o great, that the Mouth of it might
<PB N="196" REF="409">
be &s;aid to be, Four or Five Miles over, and
rather received this River, which they were
on, into it, than ran into this; but after this,
it contracted it&s;elf again, tho' &s;till it was to
be &s;uppo&s;ed near a Mile and Half over.</P>
<P>They were not glad of this Conjunction of
the Waters at all, becau&s;e the great Water be|ing
thus joined, they found the Stream, or Cur|rent,
more violent, and the Water, upon the
lea&s;t Stirring of the Wind, much more turbu|lent
than it was before; and, as their great
Float drew but little Wa$$r, and &s;wa$ flat
upon the Surface, &s;he was ready to founder
upon every Occa&s;ion: This obliged them,
almo&s;t every Night, to &s;eek for &s;ome little
Cove or Creek to run her into, as into a Har|bour
to pre&s;erve her; for it the Wind blew
off Shore, they had enough to do to keep her
from driving off, if it blew off from the
River, tho' it were, otherwi&s;e, little Wind
enough, yet it made a Rippling or Chopping of
the Waves, that they had much Difficulty to
keep it from filling her.</P>
<P>All the Country, on the Side of this River,
was a little higher Ground than ordinary,
which was its Security from Land-Floods,
and their Security too, for &s;ometimes the Ri|ver
was &s;een to ri&s;e, and that &s;o as to over|&s;low
a great Extent of Land on the other Side.
Hence, perhaps, the other Side might be
e&s;teemed the mo&s;t fruitful, and, perhaps,
might be the better Land, if it had but Half
of the Art and Indu&s;try of an <HI>European</HI> Nation
to a&s;&s;i&s;t: the natural Fertility of the Soil,
by keeping the Water in its Bounds, banking and
<PB N="197" REF="410">
fencing the Meadows from the Inundations,
and Fre&s;hes, which were frequently &s;ent
down from the <HI>Andes,</HI> and from the Country
adjoining.</P>
<P>But as it now was, tho&s;e Lower Lands lay,
great Part of the Year, under Water; whe|ther
it was the better or the wor&s;e for the Soil,
that no Judgment can be made of, till &s;ome
People come to &s;ettle there, to whom it &s;hall
be worth while to make Experiments of that
Kind.</P>
<P>This Part of the Country, they were now
in, re&s;embled, as they hinted, the County
of <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> and the Downs about <HI>Salisbury,</HI>
only, not lying &s;o high from the Surface of
the Water, and the Soil being a good fruit|ful
dark Mould, not a chalky &s;olid Rock, as
in the County about <HI>Salisbury,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here they found a greater Quantity of
Deer than they had &s;een in all their Journey,
which they often had the good Luck to kill
for their Supply of Food, the Creatures not
being &s;o &s;hy and wild, as they had found
farther within the Country.</P>
<P>It may be noted here, and 'tis very ob&s;er|vable,
that in all this Journey, I do not learn,
that they &s;aw either Wolf or Fox, Bear or
Lyon, or, indeed, any other ravenous Crea|ture,
which they had the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to be
&s;hy or afraid of, or which, indeed, were
frightful to the Deer; and this, perhaps, may
be the Rea&s;on, why the Number of tho&s;e
Creatures is &s;o great, which, as I have &s;aid, is
greater there than at other Places.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="411">
After they had fea&s;ted them&s;elves here, as
above, for &s;ome Days, they re&s;olved to begin
their New Kind of Navigation, and &s;ee what
they could make of it; but they went very
heavily along, and every now and then, <HI>as I have
&s;aid above,</HI> the Water was too rough for them,
and they were fain to put into Harbour, and
&s;ometimes lie Two or Three Days: How|ever,
they plyed their Time as well as they
could, and &s;ometimes the Current &s;etting over
to their Side, and running &s;trong by the Shore,
they would go at a great Rate, in&s;omuch,
that one Time, they &s;aid, they went above
Thirty Miles in a Day, having, be&s;ides the
Current, a little Gale of Wind right a
Stern</P>
<P>They reckoned, that they went near Two
Hundred Miles in this Manner, for they
made the be&s;t of it; and at the End of this
Two Hundred Miles, it was, by their Reck|oning,
that our Five Men, who travelled into
the Country &s;o far, found them, when they
&s;aw the Hat &s;wimming down the Stream;
which Hat, it &s;eems, one of them let fall over|board
in the Night.</P>
<P>They had, I &s;ay, travelled thus far with
great Difficulty, the River being &s;o large;
But, as they ob&s;erved it growing larger and
larger, the farther they went, &s;o, they &s;aid, they
did not doubt, but that, in a little more,
they &s;hould come to the Sea.</P>
<P>They al&s;o ob&s;erved, that now, as they
found the Waters larger, and the Rivers wi|der,
they killed more Fowls than formerly,
and particularly, more of the Duck-foot
<PB N="199" REF="412">
Kind, tho' they could not perceive any Sea-Fowls,
or &s;uch as they had been u&s;ed to. They
&s;aw a great many wild Swans, and &s;ome
Gee&s;e, as al&s;o Duck, and Mallard, and
Teal; and the&s;e, I &s;ay, increa&s;ed as they
drew nearer the Sea.</P>
<P>They could give very little Account of the
Fi&s;h which the Rivers produced, tho' they
&s;ometimes catched a few in the &s;maller Ri|ver;
but, as they had neither Fi&s;hing-hook
or Nets, which was the only Omi&s;&s;ion, in my
fitting them out, they had no Opportunity
to furni&s;h them&s;elves.</P>
<P>They had, likewi&s;e, no Salt, neither was
it po&s;&s;ible to furni&s;h them with Salt, &s;o they
cured their Meat in the Sun, and &s;ea&s;oned
it with that excellent Sauce called Hun|ger.</P>
<P>The Account they gave, of di&s;covering
our Five Men, was thus, in &s;hort; They had
been for Two Days, pretty &s;ucce&s;sful in their
Navigation, as I have de&s;cribed it; but were
obliged to &s;top, and put in at the Mouth of
a little River, which made them a good Har|bour;
the Rea&s;on of their Stay was, they
had no Victuals, &s;o by con&s;ent, they all went
a hunting, and at Night, having &s;hot Two
<HI>Guinacoes</HI> and a Deer, they came to Sup|per
together in their great Tent; and having
fed heartily, you may &s;uppo&s;e, on &s;uch good
Provi&s;ions, they began to be merry, and the
Captain and Officers, having a little Store
left, tho' not much, they pulled out their
Bottles, and drank every one a Dra$$ to their
<PB N="200" REF="413">
good Voyage, and to the merry Meeting of
their Ships, and gave every Man a Sup.</P>
<P>But their Mirth was increa&s;ed beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ing,
when Two of the Men, who were
without the Tent-Door, cried out, it light|ened;
one &s;aid, he &s;aw the Fla&s;h, he was
&s;ure, and the other &s;aid, he thought he &s;aw it
too; but, as it happened, their Backs were
towards the <HI>E.</HI> &s;o that they did not &s;ee the
Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This Lightning was certainly the fir&s;t
Fla&s;h of one of our Five Mens Rockets, or
the Breaking of it, and the Stars that were at
the End of it, up in the Air.</P>
<P>When the Captain heard the Men &s;ay it
light$ned, he jumped off of his Seat, and
called aloud to them, to tell which Way; but
they fooli&s;hly replied, to the <HI>N. W.</HI> which
was the Way their Faces were, when they
&s;aw it, but the Word was no &s;ooner &s;poken,
but the Two Fellows, fell a Hollowing and
Roaring, as if they were di&s;tracted, and &s;aid,
they &s;aw a Rocket ri&s;e up in the Air to the
<HI>Ea&s;tward.</HI></P>
<P>So nimble were the Men, at this Word, that
they were all out of the Tent in a Moment,
and &s;aw the la&s;t Bounce or Fla&s;h of the Roc|ket
with the Stars, which &s;preading them&s;elves
in the Air, &s;hone with the u&s;ual bright Light,
that 'tis known tho&s;e Things give.</P>
<P>This made them all &s;et up a Shout of Joy,
as if they imagined their Fellows, who were
yet many Miles from them, &s;hould hear them;
but the Captain and Officers, who knew what
they were to do on this Occa&s;ion, ran to their
<PB N="201" REF="414">
Baggage, and took out their own Rockets and
other Materials, and prepared to an&s;wer the
Signal.</P>
<P>They were on a low Ground, but at le&s;s
than a Mile's Di&s;tance, the Land went a&s;cend|ing
up to a round Crown or Knowl pretty high;
away they ran thither, and let up a Frame in
an in&s;tant: But, as they were making the&s;e
Preparations, behold, to confirm their News,
they &s;aw a Third Rocket ri&s;e up in the Air,
in the &s;ame Place as before.</P>
<P>It was near an Hour from the fir&s;t Fla&s;h,
as they called it, before they could get all
Things ready; but then they fired Two
Rockets from the adjoining Hill, &s;oon after
one another, and after that, at about Ten
Minutes Di&s;tance of Time, a third, which
was ju&s;t as by Agreement, and was perfectly
understood, the Rockets performing very
well.</P>
<P>Upon this, they &s;aw another &s;ingle Rocket
ri&s;e up, which was to let them know, that
their former was &s;een and understood.</P>
<P>This was, you will conclude, a very joy|ful
Night; and the next Morning, they went
all Hands to work at the Boats, getting out
of the Creek early, and made the be&s;t of
their Way; however, with all they could do,
they could not go above Twelve Miles that
Day, for, the Current &s;etting over to the
other Shore, had left them, and in &s;ome
Places, they would rather have an eddy
Stream again&s;t them; and this di&s;couraged
them a little, but depending that they were
near their Port, and that their Friends were
<PB N="202" REF="415">
not far off, they were very chearful. At
Night they looked out again for Rockets,
which failed not to rejoyce their Hearts
again; and, with this Addition, that it ap|peared,
their Friends were not above Four
or Five Miles off; they an&s;wered the Rock|ets
punctually, and proceeding early the next
Day, they met in the Morning, joyfully
enough, as has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>We were overjoyed at meeting, you may be
&s;ure; but to &s;ee the pitiful Boat, or <HI>Periagua,</HI>
they came on Board in, a little &s;urprized us,
for, indeed, it was a Wonder they &s;hould be
able to make it &s;wim under them, e&s;pecially
when they came out into the open Sea.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had the Boat on Board, we
hal'd it up into the Ship for a Relick, and
taking Two of the Men with us, we Mann'd
out all our Ships Boats to go and fetch the
re&s;t, for they were, as the&s;e Men told us,
about Seventeen Miles up the River &s;till, and
could not come any farther, their Boats be|ing
not able to bring them along, and the
River growing very broad and dangerous.
The Elde&s;t of my Mid&s;hipmen came in this
Fir&s;t Boat, but the Captain and the other
&s;taid with the Men, who were very unruly,
and ever and anon quarrelling and wrangling
about their Wealth, which, indeed, was very
con&s;iderable, but they were above twice as
far up the River as the Men told us, having
halted after the Boat left them.</P>
<P>When our Boats came to them, and took
them in, I ordered they &s;hould be &s;et on
Shore, and their Tents put up on the Shore,
<PB N="203" REF="416">
'till I had &s;ettled Matters a little with them,
having had an Account how Mutinous and
Fractious they had been; and I made them
all &s;tay there 'till I had fully adju&s;ted every
thing with them about their Trea&s;ure, which,
indeed, was &s;o much, that they &s;carce knew
how to govern them&s;elves under the Thought
of it.</P>
<P>Here I propo&s;ed Conditions to them at
fir&s;t, That all the Gold &s;hould be &s;hared be|fore
they went on Board, and that it &s;hould
be put on Board the Ship, as Goods for every
Man's &s;ingle Account; that I would give them
Bills of Lading for it, and I offered to &s;wear
to them, to deliver it into every Man's Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,
&s;eparately, at the Fir&s;t Port we &s;hould
come to an Anchor at in <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>France;</HI>
and that, at that &s;aid Port, they &s;hould every
Man have the One hundred Pounds I had
promi&s;ed them, as above, for the undertak|ing
this Journey, delivered to them in Mo|ney,
that is to &s;ay, In <HI>Gold-Du&s;t;</HI> and that
they alone, &s;hould have full Liberty to go
on Shore with it, and go whither they would,
no Man whatever, but them&s;elves, being al|lowed
to &s;et Foot on Shore in the &s;ame Place,
<HI>Di&s;tre&s;s excepted.</HI> This they in&s;i&s;ted on, be|cau&s;e
they had done &s;ome Things, which, if I
would, I might have pur&s;ued &s;ome of them, for
perhaps, to the Gallows; but that I promi&s;ed
to forgive them, and to enquire no more af|ter
it.</P>
<P>In a Word, There had been a Scuffle among
'em, in which one of their Canoes was over&s;et,
<HI>as was &s;aid,</HI> and one of their Number drowned,
<PB N="204" REF="417">
at the &s;ame Time when they lo&s;t a great
Part of their Gold; and &s;ome were thought
to have done it maliciou&s;ly too.</P>
<P>However, as I had no Occa&s;ion to trouble
them on that Score, not being upon the Spot
when it was done; &s;o having made this
Capitulation with them, I performed it pun|ctually,
and &s;et them all on Shore, with their
Wealth, in the River of <HI>Garonne</HI> in <HI>France;</HI>
Their Gold, their One hundred Pounds Re|ward
for their Journey; their Wages, and
their Share of Pearl, and other Advantages,
made them very rich; for their Cargo, when
ca&s;t up on Shore, might, perhaps, amount
to about Four hundred Pounds a Man: How
they di&s;po&s;ed of them&s;elves, or their Money,
I never gave my&s;elf the Trouble to enquire,
and, if I had, 'tis none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s to give
an Account of it here.</P>
<P>We di&s;mi&s;&s;ed al&s;o, near Four&s;core more of
our Men, afterwards, in a little Creek, which
was at their own Reque&s;t; for mo&s;t of them
having been of the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Men, and, by
Con&s;equence, Pyrates, they were willing to
be ea&s;y, and I was as willing to make them
&s;o, and, therefore, cleared with as many of
them as de&s;ired it. But I return to our
Ship.</P>
<P>Having thus made a long Capitulation
with our Travellers, I took them all on Board,
and had Lei&s;ure enough to have a long Nar|ration
from them of their Voyage, and from
which Account, I take the Liberty to recom|mend
that Part of <HI>America,</HI> as the be&s;t, and
mo&s;t advantageous Part of the whole Globe
<PB N="205" REF="418">
for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colony, the Climate, the Soil,
and, above all, the ea&s;y Communication with
the Mountains of <HI>Chili,</HI> recommending it be|yond
any Place that I ever &s;aw, or read of,
as I &s;hall farther make appear by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>We had nothing now to do, but to make
the be&s;t of our Way for <HI>England,</HI> and &s;etting
Sail from the Mouth of the River <HI>Camerones,</HI>
&s;o the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call it, the Eighteenth of
<HI>January</HI> in which, we had a more difficult
and unplea&s;ant Voyage, than in any other
Part of our Way, chiefly becau&s;e, being a
rich Ship, and not knowing how Affairs &s;tood
in <HI>Europe,</HI> I kept to the Northward; as far as
the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> &s;teering thence to
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Galitia,</HI> where we touch'd, as
above; after which, we went through the
Channel, and arrived &s;afe in <HI>Dunkirk</HI> Road,
The Twelfth of <HI>April;</HI> and from thence gave
private Notice of our good Fortune to our Mer|chants
and Owners; Two of whom came
over to us, and received at our Hands, &s;uch
a Trea&s;ure, as gave them Rea&s;on to be very
well &s;atisfied with their Adventure: But, to
my great Grief, my particular Friend, the
Merchant, who put us upon all the Curio&s;ity,
and all the Di&s;covery you have heard of,
was dead before our Return, which, if it
had not happened, this New Scheme of a
Trade round the World, had, perhaps, ne|ver
been made Publick, till it had been put
in Practice, by a Set of Merchants de&s;igned
to be concerned in it, from the <HI>New Au&s;trian
Netherlands.</HI></P>
