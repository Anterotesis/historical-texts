<HEAD>REASONS why this Na|tion ought to put a &s;peedy End to this Expen&s;ive War, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>A MIND po&s;&s;e&s;t with any Tender|ne&s;s for the Mi&s;eries, Sufferings and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of its Native Land, that has the Happine&s;s of any Ge|nerous Principles, and &s;hares &s;omething of that &s;ublime Quality, called by the Ancients, <HI>Love of our Country,</HI> cannot look upon the pre&s;ent Condition of this Nation without being in the highe&s;t Degree affected. Our Saviour's mo&s;t affectionate View of the Ho|ly City, expre&s;s'd in that mo&s;t emphatical Text, <HI>O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem!</HI> may be with the greate&s;t Ju&s;tice and Propriety applied to this I&s;land. We &s;eem to have <HI>the things which belong unto our Peace</HI> entirely hidden <HI>from our Eyes.</HI> How have we above Twenty Years groan'd under a Long and a Bloody War? How often has our mo&s;t remote Views of Peace gladden'd our Souls, and
<PB N="4" REF="5">
chear'd up our Spirits? Our Stocks have always ri&s;en or fallen, as the Pro&s;pects we had of that amiable Object were near or remote.</P>
<P>We have &s;eldom &s;een any of our Publick Acts, whether of Parliament, or of Council, but they are Prefac'd with &s;omething or other relating to the War. The Word WAR is not expre&s;s'd in them without the Adjunct of &s;ome Epithet; &s;uch as, Bloody <HI>War,</HI> Heavy <HI>War,</HI> Chargeable <HI>War,</HI> Dange|rous <HI>War,</HI> &amp;c. Our Politicians have pro|mi&s;ed them&s;elves every Year, that the Ene|my will be reduc'd, that the War cannot hold long, that &s;urely this Year, and that Year, and the other Year, will be the la&s;t of the War. Thus have we kept up our Spirits with the Hopes of coming to the de|&s;ir'd Port, <HI>viz.</HI> the Haven of <HI>Peace;</HI> and every Effort which the Nation has made for the rai&s;ing Money to carry on this War, has been encourag'd both from Prince and People, with the putting us in hopes, that all &s;hall at la&s;t be crown'd with PEACE; that this, 'tis hoped, may be the la&s;t Year of the War. Thus once more, and once more, &amp;c. and &s;till we hoped the Work will be over; and in all this I do not &s;ee, that a Nation plung'd &s;o deep, who&s;e Weights and Pre&s;&s;ures have been &s;o many, can in any wi&s;e be reflected on; neither her Courage, her Patience, her
<PB N="5" REF="6">
Strength, her Wealth, or any part of tho&s;e things whereof her Sons &s;o boa&s;t in the be|half of her their Mother, can be reproach'd. Who ever &s;aid of <HI>Britain,</HI> that &s;he could never be weakned; that her Strength was invincible, her Wealth inexhau&s;tible? that &s;he could hold out the War for ever; that &s;he would never langui&s;h for Peace, or need re&s;pite from a Perpetual War? that &s;he could never bleed to Death; and that her Body was invulnerable? The&s;e are Things no wi&s;e Man will pretend to; nor would &s;uch a way of arguing plea&s;e the mo&s;t Sanguine among us at this time: At the Beginning of the War &s;uch Excur&s;ions might be born with, when our Youth fir&s;t felt their own Strength, and our National Riches were &s;o immen&s;e, that we per&s;uaded our &s;elves they had no Bottom. But <HI>the Ca&s;e is alter'd Now.</HI> Now we &s;ee our Trea&s;ure lo&s;t, our Funds exhau&s;ted, all our publick Revenues Sold, Mortgaged, and Anticipated; va&s;t and endle&s;s Intere&s;ts entail'd upon our Po&s;terity, the whole Kingdom &s;old to U&s;ury, and an immen&s;e Trea&s;ure turn'd into an immen&s;e Debt to pay; we went out full, but are re|turn'd empty. We find our Great Navy &s;pread the Seas to the Expence of above Three Millions Yearly, which yet our Enemies re|gard &s;o little, that they carry on the War as it were without a Navy, and think it
<PB N="6" REF="7">
not worth the Expence, to fit out their Fleet to prevent us; but they gain from us every Year by their Privateering, as much as they would lo&s;e by fitting out their Navy.</P>
<P>In our Land Armies, we expend mighty Sums to perform trifling Exploits, and plea&s;e our &s;elves with a few Inches of the Enemies Ground, bought too dear, and paid for with a double Price of Money and Blood. How do we flatter our &s;elves in the War, and call it a Glorious Campaign! when we have taken a little Fort, Ten of which have &s;carce &s;uffic'd our Enemy, the King of <HI>France,</HI> for the Triumphs of a Summer's Service.</P>
<P>When we look upon our victorious Army, and our Generals crown'd with Lawrels, and Garlands of Victory; how do tho&s;e ve|ry Victories ruine us? And how many &s;uch Battles, as that near <HI>Mons,</HI> could we bear? There we conquer'd the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Villars,</HI> and gain'd the Honour of the Field of Battle? But how lie the Bones of 22000 of the be&s;t and brave&s;t Soldiers in Chri&s;tendom &s;acrificed meerly to the P$que of Glory between the Haughty Generals, and to decide the mighty Conte&s;t between us and the <HI>French,</HI> who &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the Hedges of <HI>Taniers,</HI> or be Ma&s;ters of the little Cop|pice of <HI>Blareignes.</HI> Where was the Nece&s;|&s;ity of this Trial of Skill at &s;o great an Expence? What Enterpri&s;e was made ea&s;ie
<PB N="7" REF="8">
by it? <HI>Mons</HI> was taken afterwards, and <HI>Mons</HI> might have been taken before; the Enemy po&s;&s;e&s;s'd again the very &s;ame Spot of Ground in le&s;s than 10 Days, and bid you come on again at the &s;ame Price: Ex|perience teaching us <HI>(bloody Experience is War indeed!)</HI> that this was not the way, that &s;uch Victories would vanqui&s;h the Conqueror, that this was the only way to ruine the Troops, and give the Enemy at length the Superiority. We fall next to be&s;ieging Towns, <HI>Douay, Bethune, St. Venant,</HI> and <HI>Air,</HI> fini&s;h another Glorious Campaign, as we call it, and 35000 of our bolde&s;t and forwarde&s;t Troops lie buried in the Ditches of tho&s;e paltry Places: The Excecution is &s;o terrible, that it becomes the Aver&s;ion of the very Army it &s;elf. And whereas at the beginning of this pre&s;ent Campaign, it was given out that the General would begin the Opera|tions, &amp;c. with the Siege of <HI>Tpres,</HI> or of St. <HI>Omer,</HI> 10000 of your Men ran away and De&s;erted to the Enemy in a very few Weeks. This is confirm'd by, as it was the occa&s;ion of that cruel Proclamation of the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> appointing all that &s;hould De&s;ert and be retaken, among his Troops, to have their No&s;es cut off, and be kept in perpetual Slavery at hard Work, with a Chain about their Necks: Notwith&s;tand|ing this, we attack <HI>Bouchain,</HI> and with &s;mall
<PB N="8" REF="9">
lo&s;s obtain that Conque&s;t, having not a|bove 6000 Men Kill'd and Wounded in that Glorious Conque&s;t. His Grace the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> re&s;olving to make what Advantage he po&s;&s;ibly could, of the pre&s;ent Con&s;ternation of the <HI>French,</HI> makes Prepa|rations for another Siege, which, as was given out, &s;hould be that of <HI>Cambray,</HI> or of <HI>Valenciennes, Le Que&s;noy,</HI> or <HI>Maubeuge;</HI> but the Sea&s;on being advanc'd, and the Siege of <HI>Aire</HI> being fre&s;h in the Memory of our Men, the apprehen&s;ions of another Autumn Siege has &s;o intimidated our People, that the De&s;ertion is as great as ever, among our Troops; &s;o that our Advices from the Army tell us, the Re&s;olutions of a Siege are laid by, and the Troops will be put in|to Quarters of Refre&s;hment, and this Glori|ous Campaign, which has co&s;t the Allies &s;o many Millions, mu&s;t end on that &s;ide <HI>avec le pri&s;e de Bouchain.</HI></P>
<P>This brief Recapitulation of the &s;tate of the Affair in <HI>Flanders</HI> is thus laid down here, not in the lea&s;t to le&s;&s;en the E&s;teem we ought to have for our Generals and great Officers employ'd in this War, of who&s;e Conduct and Bravery the World &s;peaks &s;uch Glorious Things; no, this does not detract from their Characters, but rather confe&s;&s;es that they have done all that it was po&s;&s;ible for Men to do. That notwith&s;tand|ing
<PB N="9" REF="10">
the Superiority of the Enemy, they have offered them Battle in the Field, have entred their Lines, which they gave out were Im|penetrable; Attack'd and taken a Town in their View, after all their Efforts to prevent it; and after a Thou&s;and Ga&s;conades of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Villars</HI> to his Ma&s;ter, that it was impo&s;&s;ible the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> could Inve&s;t it: But this is not the Subject of the pre&s;ent Trea|ti&s;e, the Que&s;tion before us is of another kind: It is not to Enquire whether we are able to Fight and Conquer, able to pu&s;h Mon&s;ieur <HI>Villars</HI> out of his Fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, and take Towns with an Hundred Thou&s;and Wit|ne&s;&s;es; but the main Hinge whereon all the Affair now turns, is this: What is this to ending the War? How long may the King of <HI>France</HI> keep us thus at Bay? How many Towns have we yet to take from him, be|fore he can effectually be humbled and r |duced to &s;uch Terms of Peace as we pre|tend to de&s;ire? Whether to re&s;olve to car|ry on the War till <HI>France</HI> is reduc'd, after the rate of one Town every Summer, will not eternize and entail the War to us and to our Heirs for ever, or to I&s;&s;ue a few more &s;uch Glorious Campaigns in an inglorious Peace at la&s;t. It may be therefore a mo&s;t needful Enquiry for the curious Heads of this Age to reflect back a little upon our own Circum&s;tances, and enquire what Rea&s;ons
<PB N="10" REF="11">
we have, which are drawn from within our &s;elves, and turn upon the great Hinge of our own Affairs only, and which move, and pre&s;s, and call upon us to put an End to this War upon the be&s;t Conditions we can.</P>
<P>Before we come to this Enquiry, it may be al&s;o very needful to &s;ugge&s;t or premi&s;e, that by putting an End to the War, is not meant that we &s;hould &s;ue to the King of <HI>France</HI> for Peace, and take &s;uch Conditions as he &s;hall impo&s;e upon us, as if he was Conquerour, and we were &s;ubdued: But by putting an End to the War, is here to be under&s;tood, li&s;tening to a Treaty with a &s;incere De&s;ire and Re&s;olution; if the Enemy may be brought to make ju&s;t, rea&s;onable, and fair Propo&s;als, to clo&s;e with them, and not in&s;i&s;t upon one Thing after another, and grow, and encroach in Demand from one Thing to another, till at la&s;t we come to in&s;i&s;t upon Impo&s;&s;ibilities, and make &s;uch Demands as, we know, the Enemy cannot grant; or which, if they &s;hould have grant|ed, we knew they could not execute. It is not needful that we enter here into a Di&s;&s;er|tation concerning the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of our la&s;t Method of treating with the <HI>French;</HI> or whether it was &s;incere on either Side. On our Part we were daily told, the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters hover'd about the Thing it &s;elf, kept at a Di&s;tance from the Sub&s;tance of
<PB N="11" REF="12">
the Treaty, which was the Security of the Performance, and trifled with the Confede|rates. On the other Side, the <HI>French</HI> alledg'd, that the Confederates treated haughtily, as if they were with their Armies at the Gates of <HI>Paris;</HI> that they kept the <HI>French</HI> Com|mi&s;&s;ioners like Pri&s;oners in a Garri&s;on, per|mitting them to &s;peak with no Body but the <HI>Dutch</HI> Deputies, who came and went like meer Me&s;&s;engers of an Errand; that they were not allowed to &s;ee any of the Mini&s;ters of the other Allies, tho' they were concern'd in the War as well as they, as if the <HI>Dutch</HI> were afraid that their Propo&s;als were &s;o rea&s;onable, the re&s;t of the Allies &s;hould think them &s;ufficient, and be enclin'd to clo&s;e with them; That the <HI>Dutch</HI> acted by the Pen&s;ionary, and the Lord <HI>T</HI>&mdash;in Concert with the D&mdash;of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Court would never come to any Certainty what would content them; but daily declared every Thing un&s;atisfacto|ry, till at la&s;t, being pre&s;&s;ed to declare what they would have, they put the whole up|on an Impo&s;&s;ibility, as to the King of <HI>France</HI> obliging his Grand&s;on to evacuate <HI>Spain;</HI> re|fu&s;ing the lea&s;t Equivalent for peaceably giving up &s;uch va&s;t Dominions above Eight Year in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
Many more Particulars might be objected here again&s;t the Methods and Mea&s;ures taken with the Enemy, in the la&s;t Treaty which was managed at <HI>Ghertrydenbergh:</HI> But this may &s;uffice to include the whole, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that we treated them as if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had been Pri&s;oner of War, and the King of <HI>France</HI> fled from <HI>Ver&s;ailles;</HI> or ra|ther, as if a certain General had put them both into his Coach; and as if not only <HI>Spain,</HI> but <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf, had been lo&s;t: And that this may not pa&s;s for the Words of this Pamphlet only, it may not be ami&s;s to note, that when the Marqui&s;s <HI>de &V;xelles</HI> complain'd of the ill Succe&s;s of their Ne|gotiation, and that they treated as if they had <HI>France</HI> in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; He was an&s;wer'd, that <HI>He ought to reckon it his good For|tune, that he had the Honour to &s;ave the Kingdom of</HI> France <HI>upon &s;uch ea&s;y Terms.</HI> Whether it was due to the Scituation of our Affairs at that Time, to pu&s;h Matters to &s;uch a Height; the Proce&s;s of another Campaign may better argue than any o|ther kind of Demon&s;tration, &s;ince another whole Summer is pa&s;t over; another glorious Campaign in <HI>Flanders</HI> ended. The great, and &s;o much boa&s;ted Impre&s;&s;ion the D. of <HI>Savoy</HI> was to make, is ended, and that Prince retired, and <HI>France</HI> is not yet won; No, not a Foot &s;et in its Dominions, and
<PB N="13" REF="14">
but a very few Inches of Ground gain'd, which we have paid dear for, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Many Thou&s;ands of our be&s;t Troops kill'd and wounded; many Millions of Trea&s;ure ex|pended, and near <HI>Twenty Thou&s;and</HI> of our Men run away and de&s;erted to the Enemy; Nay, &s;o great is the De&s;ertion of the Sol|diers for Fear of another Siege, that even at the Writing the&s;e Sheets, the pub|lick printed News &s;ays, <HI>The De&s;ertion of the Infantry is Great to A&s;toni&s;hment.</HI> Vide the <HI>Po&s;t-Boy,</HI> No. 2552. <HI>September</HI> the 20<HI>th</HI> 1711.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;erve us for &s;o many Convictions of the Imprudence of our late Conduct in treating with the <HI>French;</HI> which either pro|ceeded from a mi&s;grounded Elevation in the Allies, upon the Succe&s;s of the former Cam|paigns, and &s;trange Notions that the <HI>French</HI> were in no Condition to carry on the War, no not one Campaign more; or el&s;e from &s;elfi&s;h Principles in &s;ome of the Per&s;ons con|cern'd, who for Rea&s;ons of their own, were unwilling the War &s;hould End, and would choo&s;e rather to &s;acrifice their Country, and the Intere&s;t of their Queen, than make u&s;e of any Opportunity, how Advantageous &s;oever, to make a Peace with the Enemy. It is not the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Tract to en|quire, which of the&s;e Principles were the fatal overthrow of the Treaty; or what has
<PB N="14" REF="15">
prompted us to carry on the War for this la&s;t Year, when &s;o good Conditions of Peace were then offered, and &s;o little gain by the War was in view.</P>
<P>But it is worthy our Notice here, and not improper to the Purpo&s;e, to ob&s;erve, how very much we have all along deceiv'd our &s;elves with Hopes from the weakne&s;s of the <HI>French,</HI> having &s;o blinded our Eyes with the Accounts of their bad Condition, that we have en|tirely overlook'd the Decay of our own. Every Autumn we have repre&s;ented the broken Condition of their Troops; and thro' the whole Sea&s;on for recruiting the Forces, we have been amu&s;ed with ficti|tious Accounts of their Cavalry being in no Condition to take the Field, their Re|cruits for the Foot not being arrived; the Difficulty the Intendants of the Provinces found to rai&s;e Men; the Men when rai&s;ed, being forced again&s;t their Wills, taking all Opportunities to de&s;ert; the Quality of the Recruits; their being mo&s;t made up of Boys and Youths unfit for Service: Yet has it been always ob&s;erved, that towards the marching of the Armies into the Field, the Scene have been changed, and we have Accounts, that their Cavalry make a fine Appearance; that their Infantry are new cloath'd; and every Year, to enhance the
<PB N="15" REF="16">
Value of every Advantage we gain over them, we forget not to own their Superiority in Number.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore that the&s;e Hopes have not yet appear'd well grounded, and that, notwith&s;tanding all our Expectations, the Enemy lets us &s;ee, that he is &s;till able to hold out, and that he dares to carry on the War, notwith&s;tanding our Threats, and the Menaces of our Deputies. It &s;eems that it is not now the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Allies to amu&s;e them&s;elves with the Expectation of reducing him every Campaign, as we have done; the vain Fruit of which has &s;upport|ed the Nation &s;o long.</P>
<P>It &s;eems rather the Work of the con&s;ider|ing Heads now employed, to rectify the&s;e Er|rors; and, if it be to be retrieved, make &s;ome Amends to the Nation of <HI>Britain</HI> for the pa&s;t Mi&s;take. <HI>Peace is the Thing we want;</HI> if it &s;hould be our Misfortune to have any Number of Men among us, who are of a differing Opinion, they are calmly entreated to con&s;ider &s;ome Heads; (1.) Of our own Circum&s;tances; And (2.) of our Enemies: From both which, if impartially and with|out Prejudice &s;earch'd into, they may find Rea&s;on to yield up this Point, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to us to put an End to this War.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17">
Nor has it been deny'd, even by the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t Men concerned in the la&s;t Mini&s;try, that we were in &s;o much Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Peace; the Error lay in this Part of it, (whether it was a Delu&s;ion or no, Time may di&s;cover) That they per&s;uaded us, and perhaps them&s;elves al&s;o, that the King of <HI>France</HI> was in a greater Exigence, and that Peace was more nece&s;&s;ary to him than to the Allies. We &s;hall con&s;ider the Circum&s;tances of both, and perhaps the Inferences may decide the Controver&s;ies on both Sides at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tions are very material, and ad|mit of &s;ome Enlargement; but this may be received as the Ab&s;tract of the whole.</P>
<P N="1">I. What Occa&s;ion we have for Peace.</P>
<P N="2">II. What Condition the <HI>French</HI> are in to carry on the War.</P>
<P>The Occa&s;ion we have for Peace, it is too har&s;h to &s;ay, the Nece&s;&s;ity we are in for it proceeds from,</P>
<P N="1">1. The great Lo&s;s and Hindrance the car|rying on this War is to our Commerce; to the Exportation of our Manufactures and Home-growth; to the Employment of our Poor; and to the Con&s;umption of the Pro|duce of this I&s;land in Foreign Parts. It is an unplea&s;ant Work for any Writer to
<PB N="17" REF="18">
expo&s;e the Weakne&s;s of his Country, and the Decay of Trade among our People.</P>
<P>But let any of our general Calculators in the&s;e Matters determine this Ca&s;e: Let it be enquired, Whether the <HI>Rates</HI> of our Ma|nufactures are held up to the former Price? Whether our Wool is con&s;umed? Or whe|ther there is Three Years Growth of Wool now in the Hands of the Farmers, and Graziers, and Sheep Ma&s;ters, in this I&s;land un&s;old? Together with this they may enquire, whether the Price of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Wool is not, by this great Interruption of our Trade, fallen near 40<HI>l. per Cent.</HI> in Value; and if this does not yet affect the Landed-Men, no doubt it mu&s;t affect them in a little Time.</P>
<P>Di&s;cour&s;es of Trade are not the particular Talent of the Author of this, and there|fore farther Enlargement on this Head is a|voided; but if it may be allowed to weigh any Thing in this Ca&s;e, the Reader is de|&s;ired to ob&s;erve the Number of Shops and Hou&s;es now &s;hut up, and to be Lett between <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> and <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s;</HI> which, as it has been ob&s;erved, are now more than ever were known: And the like Proportion is, as we are credibly informed, in mo&s;t of the Great and Trading Towns in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19">
The Author has been told, that above 50 Shops are &s;hut up, or to be lett, between <HI>Lud|gate</HI> and <HI>Temple-Bar;</HI> That 10 Hou&s;es, which were formerly of con&s;iderable Whole&s;ale Trades-Men, are &s;hut up about <HI>Holbourn-Bridge;</HI> and the Number of Bankrupts in every <HI>Gazette,</HI> is an A&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Come we in the next Place to con&s;ider the Taxes and Anticipations which are yearly paid, and lie as a dead Weight up|on the Ages to come. That every Article of the Revenues is Mortgaged and Antici|pated, and that, generally &s;peaking, for an Hundred Years to come. It is unplea&s;ant to enumerate the Funds lodg'd in the Offi|ces of the Exchequer, for Payment of An|nuities, Tickets, Exchequer Bills, and Tallies, they are too well known to make it need|ful in this Ca&s;e. The Heads of the Pro|jectors have been rack'd for new-invented Taxes, and the Number of tho&s;e Taxes exceeds all that ever were practis'd in the late Rebellion. All Duties and Cu&s;toms are &s;tretch'd to the Extremity that they can bear, and beyond what it was behev'd in former Times could be practicable. Every nece&s;&s;ary Import or Produce, our Corn and Cattle excepted, are taxed to the high|e&s;t Pitch they are capable of; &s;uch as Coals, Salt, Malt, Leather, Candles, Beer, Ale, Cyder, Perry, Spirits, Vinegar, Gla&s;s-Win|dows,

From what has been &s;aid, the Truth of which may ea&s;ily be proved, this &s;ingle Que&s;tion &s;eems to be offer'd to the Con&s;i|deration of the People of this I&s;land: Whe|ther ought we, on the one Hand, to lay a General Exci&s;e or Tax upon all Cloaths, Hou&s;hold Stuff, and Food; or &s;top the Pay|ment of the Funds? Or, on the other Hand, put an End to the War?</P>
<P>If any Objector will put in his Prote&s;t again&s;t the Alternative, and alledge, that we are not brought to the Nece&s;&s;ity of this Choice, he mu&s;t, at the &s;ame Time, let us &s;ee what Door of E&s;cape he has found out, and by what other Method he can propo&s;e to rai&s;e Money for Carrying on the War. The Writer of the&s;e Sheets owns to have &s;een the Schemes of Taxes offer'd by mo&s;t of the Projectors of this Town the la&s;t Year, and does think he may affirm, there is not one which contains not, either &s;ome Branches of a <HI>General Exci&s;e,</HI> as above, or &s;omething equivalent to it, and equally op|pre&s;&s;ive; &s;o that the Nation, either would not, or could not bear them; and he is the bolder therefore to &s;ay, there are no other Ways but the Two above&s;aid. We will not &s;ay, the &s;topping the Payment of the Funds has been projected by either the pre&s;ent or pa&s;t Mini&s;try, tho' it has been reported of both; but e&s;pecially was it thrown upon one,
<PB N="21" REF="22">
perhaps to conceal its being the real De&s;ign of the other. But it is left to any unpreju|dic'd Judgment to con&s;ider, what would be the Effects of either of the&s;e Things to the Nation.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, one U&s;e may not be im|properly made of this, which, by way of Remark, is laid here before the Reader for his Con&s;ideration; <HI>and it is this,</HI> that the Weakne&s;s of a Topick much made U&s;e of among a di&s;&s;atisfied Party of Men among us, appears by it <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the Way to overthrow the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try is, to plunge them in the Matter of Funds, ruine the publick Credit, and bring them to &s;uch Exigencies, that they cannot carry on the War; that then the <HI>Queen</HI> mu&s;t change her Mini&s;try a|gain; and the&s;e People, not being able to &s;upport the Government, or carry on the War, Her Maje&s;ty mu&s;t, of Nece&s;&s;ity, have Recour&s;e to tho&s;e who are able to do both. The Weakne&s;s of which Argument, as is &s;aid, appears very con&s;picuous; for that all the Di|fficulties the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try are driven unto by the People, who thus endeavour to plunge them, are really no Difficulties at all, any other than as the Mini&s;try are back|ward and unwilling to bring Hard&s;hips and &s;evere Things upon the Country; that they are loth to lay tho&s;e heavy Taxes upon the People, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, if
<PB N="22" REF="23">
they are obliged to rai&s;e the whole Money, nece&s;&s;ary for the Service of every Year, in that Year wherein it is to be wanted; or loth to put a Stop to the Payment of In|tere&s;t, which falls Annually due upon the publick Funds for Money already borrowed, and which they know, would fall heavy upon innumerable Families, tho' it is not doubted, Ten Parts of Twelve of the Land|ed Men in <HI>England,</HI> would come into &s;uch a Propo&s;al. If the Mini&s;try would come in to either of the&s;e Propo&s;als, <HI>it is obvious,</HI> they may carry on the War as long as they plea&s;e, without being obliged any more to court tho&s;e People for upholding the pub|lick Credit, who make that Advantage a Plan for the De&s;truction of the Mini&s;try: Either of the Two Articles afore&s;aid, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of General Exci&s;es, or &s;topping the Pay|ment of the Funds, would be &s;ufficient eve|ry Year for the Service of that re&s;pective Year. This one of their own Writers told them plainly enough; for which, I hear him frequently curs'd among them, tho', it &s;eems, the Man has more Penetration in tho&s;e Matters, than mo&s;t of them; for no|thing is more certain, than that the Endea|vours of the <HI>Whigs</HI> to de&s;troy the publick Credit, has expo&s;ed them more than any other of their Conduct; as if they were a Party willing to ruine the Nation, rather
<PB N="23" REF="24">
than not keep the Reins in their own Hands; and as if they were re&s;olved that the New Mini&s;try &s;hould fall, tho' them&s;elves were to fall with them. This, the afore&s;aid Writer, tho' of their own Party, very well indeed, and with pungent Rea&s;ons, warn'd them of, under the appo&s;ite Simily of &s;ink|ing the Ship; but when Envy blinds Mens Eyes, they are render'd deaf to the Coun&s;el of their Friends, much more are they &s;o to that of their Enemies; for they ca&s;t Stones at the Advice, and, as I am inform'd, at the Advi&s;er too.</P>
<P>And now their Mi&s;take appears plain, and nothing expo&s;es them more; for it is obvious to every Eye, that the Govern|ment have THREE Ways to avoid the Mi&s;|chief; and that Snare which the Party thought could not fail, is Three Ways to be broken, and brought to Nought.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>By General Exci&s;es,</HI> which will rai&s;e &s;ufficient every Year for the whole Demand of the War for that Year.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>By Stop of the Funds,</HI> which would cau&s;e the Cu&s;toms, the Exci&s;e, the Duties on Salt, Leather, Coals, Candles, Hops, Windows, Stamp't Paper, Po&s;t-Office, and all other appropriated Taxes, to be paid directly into

the publick Trea&s;ury, for carrying on th War.</P>
<P N="3">III. OR, if either of the&s;e were no thought fit to be done, then was it in th Power of the Government, according t Her Maje&s;ty's Prerogative, to put a End to the War; which, if it were no then &s;o advantageou&s;ly concluded as $ ought to be, or as once it might hav been; yet the People might &s;ee wh had compell'd them to it, and on who$ all the Blame of it ought to be laid.</P>
<P>This leads us to the Enquiry, which as appears by the Title, is the main End and De&s;ign of the&s;e Sheets, <HI>(viz.</HI> What are the Rea&s;ons why we &s;hould put a &s;peedy End to this War? And though there are many more, yet &s;ome of them may be under&s;tood by the&s;e that follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e it does not &s;eem to be EASY for us to carry on the War&punc; It is with Re&s;pect to the Two forme$ Heads, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the General Exci&s;es, and the Stop of the Funds; that the Word <HI>Po&s;&s;ible,</HI> is not put here in&s;tead of the Word <HI>Ea&s;y.</HI></P>

It is Confe&s;s'd as afore&s;aid, that the War might &s;till be Continued if the Go|vernment would &s;o far abandon all Con|cern for the Mi&s;eries and Di&s;a&s;ters of the Poor, as to load them with the in&s;up|portable Taxes which are Practi&s;ed in Foreign Countries; and &s;uch as other Governments do Tax their People with, &s;uch as Gabels upon Corn, as in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Switzerland;</HI> Polls upon their Sheep and Black Cattle, as in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Bran|denburgh,</HI> Tailles upon their Shops and Trades, as in <HI>France,</HI> or general Exci&s;e upon their Eatables to the very Turneps, Carrets and Cabbage, as in <HI>Holland.</HI> Thus the War may be Continued, tho' this is not any Objection again&s;t the Rea&s;on above, for this will not be called Carrying it on <HI>EASILY,</HI> and therefore the Govern|ment finding the War cannot <HI>EASILY</HI> be Continued, <HI>i. e.</HI> without Heavy, In&s;up|portable and Oppre&s;&s;ive Burthens on the People, and e&s;pecially on the Poor.

2. Becau&s;e by a Treaty of Peace, it is probable the true Ends and De&s;igns of this War, and for which it was at fir&s;t Undertaken may be obtain|ed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Pretence of and which for a long time was the Introduction to all Publick Acts relating to this War, was, The Reducing the Exorbitant Power of <HI>France;</HI> by Degrees this Title to the War was dropt, perhaps by &s;ome that found the End obtain'd &s;ooner than they De|&s;ired it &s;hould be. And then, we had it Chang'd for the&s;e Words; For the Ob|taining a La&s;ting, Safe, and Honourable Peace; the&s;e Words were thought &s;o Exten&s;ive that they might afford the Par|ties room to &s;hift at, and con&s;tantly Fur|ni&s;h them with Matter, to Object, and with Pretences to keep the Rupture on Foot, and to keep the Wound open on pretence that the Cure was not Perfect, that the Peace was not La&s;ting and Safe.</P>
<P>But fore&s;eeing afterwards, That the King of <HI>France</HI> really made &s;uch Offers, that Contained all the Three Terms which the Peace was to have. (1.) That it was <HI>Honourable,</HI> for that the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;ought it and yielded to many great De|mands, &s;uch as fully Confe&s;s'd his being
<PB N="27" REF="28">
Over-match'd in the War. (2.) That it was Safe, becau&s;e the King of <HI>France</HI> re&s;to|red &s;uch Strengths, and put into their Hands &s;uch Countries, as might for Ever enable the Confederates to over-power him. And (3.) That both the&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;ted to make it Durable and La&s;ting. Fore&s;eeing this, I &s;ay, the People who &s;till were unwil|ling to bring the War to a Period, Chang'd the Title a Second Time, and call'd it a War for recovering the whole Monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI>&mdash;Nay, when they come by a Treaty to &s;ee a Probabi|lity of obtaining this al&s;o. They chang'd their Demands a Third Time into&mdash;The Security for Evacuation, refu&s;ing the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Offer of Money to be Contributed for his Quota of the War, to Compel his Grand&s;on to Evacuate <HI>Spain,</HI> if he &s;hould refu&s;e it.</P>
<P>The&s;e things having made it appear that the true Ends of the War may be obtain'd by a Treaty of Peace, and that there has been &s;ome Namele&s;s Errour in all former Treaties, which have ren|dred them Abortive. It mu&s;t be allow'd, by rea&s;onable and indifferent People, that if Her Maje&s;ty can obtain by a Peace, what this War was at fir&s;t un|dertaken for, this join'd to the former,
<PB N="28" REF="29">
is a good Rea&s;on why a &s;peedy End &s;hould be put to the War.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e that tho' it were to be allow'd, that by continuing the War, &s;ome greater Advantage in the Terms of a Peace might be obtain'd; yet that tho&s;e Advantages do not &s;eem adequate and proportioned to the Ex|pence and Lo&s;s, the Effu&s;ion of Blood, the Expence of Trea&s;ure, and the Hard&s;hips &s;uffered by the Nation in their Trade, and in their Taxes, which mu&s;t be the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;e|quences of Continuing the War.</P>
<P>This relates to the Evacuation of <HI>Spain,</HI> and putting it into the Hands of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> which tho' Nece&s;&s;ary to be done in the View of things at the Beginning of the War, &s;eem not to be either &s;o Nece&s;&s;ary, or indeed of that Con&s;equence to the Allies, the Face of Affairs in <HI>Europe</HI> being now Changed as they were before. <HI>First,</HI> With Re&s;pect to the Exorbitant Power of <HI>France,</HI> which is &s;o Broken and Reduced by this long War, as that 'tis believed <HI>France</HI> has got|ten a full Surfeit of the Ambitious Gu&s;t to Univer&s;al Monarchy, and is in no Condition to turn his Thought that way
<PB N="29" REF="30">
for a Hundred Years to come. And <HI>Se|condly,</HI> With Re&s;pect to the Death of the late Emperour, by which it becomes a Que&s;tion on the other Hand, whether it is not every way more Safe for <HI>Europe, Trade being &s;ecured</HI> to leave <HI>Spain</HI> in the Hands of King <HI>Philip,</HI> rather than join it undivided to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> a thing which was once &s;o fatal to <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom</HI> before.</P>

<P>The Advantages which might be far|ther Obtained by carrying on the War, &s;eem all to be made Doubtful by this Article, &s;ince it remains Evident, tho&s;e Advantages will all fall to the Share of the Emperour.

<P>This Re&s;pects the <HI>Danes, Sweeds,</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> who having now brought the War into the very Heart of the Empire, it &s;eems that which way &s;oever it &s;ucceeds, it will Affect us; if the <HI>Sweeds</HI> are reduced, the Guarrantee of the <HI>Protestant</HI> Intere&s;t in <HI>Germany</HI> is cut off; if the <HI>Sweeds</HI> pre|vail, the Empire is Weakened, the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> Ruin'd, and their Troops in our Armies recalled, and if that War is Continued it is to be feared mo&s;t of the

Burthen of the War: Nay, as if <HI>Britain</HI> was under the Tutelage of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the&s;e People would have all the Articles of Peace concerted and deter|min'd by them; not intru&s;ting us with any Share in them, as People not of age, and uncapable of acting for our &s;elves&mdash;What Impo&s;itions, what Severities, what Niceties, were the occa&s;ion of the brea|king off of the La&s;t Treaty, they take up|on them to ju&s;tify; and make tho&s;e things, which were even then accounted to be but as Circum&s;tances of the Treaty, pa&s;s for E&s;&s;ential: As if no Method of Treating can be found out but that which was then enter'd upon, no Expedient for this or that Difficulty be voted &s;afe for us, but ju&s;t what was then thought of&mdash;And that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were the Mint in which every Ar|ticle of Peace mu&s;t be coined, or el&s;e it could not be Current in the Confederacy, or that their Politicks were the Standard, by which every Step we took was to be tryed: This is making &s;uch an Idol of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as the <HI>Dutch</HI> them&s;elves do not de|&s;ire, or can have any rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>If we take any &s;tep here prejudicial to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as our Allies, or to any other of the Confederates, let the <HI>Dutch</HI> alone to complain for them&s;elves, there is no que&s;ti|on but they will be forward enough to ob|ject; but it mu&s;t have &s;ome other &s;ignifi|cation, that we &s;hould have People here

that &s;hould complain for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> before the <HI>Dutch</HI> complain for them&s;elves, as if they did not under&s;tand their own Intere&s;t, or did not know what was doing among us, as well as tho&s;e complaining People, who, we have &s;ome rea&s;on to believe, know little or nothing of the matter neither.</P>
<P>But this is not all; the&s;e Party Politicians, not only charge us with the Manner of Treating <HI>(viz.)</HI> without the Concurrence of our Allies, but with the very Terms we are to conclude, and the Conce&s;&s;ions we are to make to <HI>France,</HI> before any &s;uch Terms are treated upon, or &s;uch Conce&s;&s;ions made, or perhaps thought upon, or intended to be made. Tho' this be an unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t way of judging, yet &s;eeing it is be|come Popular, and they run away with it as Fact, it may be u&s;eful to take them in their own Way, and giving their Preten|ces the full Latitude, inquire a little into the Fact; as if it were true, whether it be &s;o or no, that &s;uch a Peace is determin'd to be made as they &s;ugge&s;t. We need not run into many Particulars here; the Grand Suppo&s;ition is, That the pre&s;ent Negotiati|ons on foot, tho' we do not grant that there are any Negotiations of any kind what|ever now on foot, or treating of at all, or propo&s;ed in order to be treated of; but to grant the Que&s;tion &s;o begg'd by Common Fame <HI>(viz.)</HI> That we were to give up <HI>Spain</HI> to the <HI>French;</HI> which &s;ome Gentlemen have
<PB N="39" REF="40">
written of as a thing &s;o fatal, that it was all one with giving up <HI>Britain;</HI> and the <HI>Review</HI> has had the mode&s;ty to &s;ay, That no Mini&s;ter of State dares &s;ign a Treaty of Peace for the Delivery of <HI>Spain.</HI> However, upon this Suppo&s;ition let us expo&s;tulate a lit|tle with the <HI>Review,</HI> or his Party, upon the Point, at the &s;ame time prote&s;ting that there is not, to our knowledge, any &s;uch Conce&s;&s;ion made, or de&s;igned to be made, or that <HI>France</HI> is under any expectation of it.</P>
<P>But upon the foot of this Prote&s;tation we may grant, for the &s;ake of the Argument only, that <HI>Spain</HI> was to be given up to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Philip</HI> V.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 1. Is there no difference between <HI>Spain</HI> in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent <HI>Philip</HI> V. and his Succe&s;&s;ours, (for he has Heirs) and <HI>Spain</HI> in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the King of <HI>France?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Will not the Heirs of the pre&s;ent K. <HI>Philip</HI> be as much <HI>Spaniards</HI> in one Age more, as the Heirs of King <HI>Lewis</HI> will be <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>vice ver&s;a?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Will the Intere&s;ts, either Politick or Trading, of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> be ever capable of any Union?</P>
<P N="4">4. Can no Treaty of Commerce be &s;o &s;ti|pulated between the Allies and King <HI>Philip,</HI> &s;o as that our Trade may be kept free and &s;ecure, whether from Em|bargoes, Prohibitions, or Impo&s;itions, under the general Guarantees of the whole Confederacy?</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="40" REF="41">
5. Is <HI>Spain</HI> of any con&s;equence to us, but as our Trade to it is, or is not &s;ecured?</P>

Is not <HI>Spain,</HI> in the hands of K. <HI>Philip,</HI> with a con&s;iderable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion freely given us in <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili,</HI> a Trade to the re&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> and a Tariff of Trade to <HI>Old Spain,</HI> better for us than <HI>Spain,</HI> in the hands of King <HI>Charles,</HI> en|tirely re&s;ign'd, without any of tho&s;e Advantages?</P>
<P N="7">7. Whether as to Power and the Bal|lance of <HI>Europe,</HI> may it not be as fatal to have <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Indies, i. e.</HI> The whole undivided Monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI> come to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and be annexed to the Empire, as to have part of it only, in a Branch of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> and that Branch not at all annex'd to the Kingdom of <HI>France?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Whether the Death of the Late Em|perour has not alter'd the ca&s;e, and chang'd the face of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o that a Partition of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, which was not rea&s;onable, the E|&s;tates of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> being in Two Branches, is now become nece&s;|&s;ary, when they are all united in One?</P>
<P N="9">9. Whether, had the Grand Alliance been now to be made, it would not have been probable, that the Confede|rates would have &s;tipulated, that the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould no more be in
<PB N="41" REF="42">
the Per&s;on of the Emperour than of the King of <HI>France?</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Whether, &s;o many Expedients offe|ring them&s;elves in this Ca&s;e, it may be worth all the Blood that may yet be ex|pended, before <HI>France</HI> can be compelled to yield up the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monar|chy, and King <HI>Philip</HI> be driven entire|ly out of it; and whether a rea&s;onable Partition be not better than &s;uch a Conque&s;t?</P>
<P N="11">11. Whether we are &s;ure that we &s;hall ever be able to compleat the Conque&s;t of it, and force them to the Evacuati|on we pretend to; and if not, whe|ther the Partition may not at la&s;t be made upon wor&s;e Terms then, than it may now?</P>
<P>The&s;e Queries are capable of great En|largements; and much may be &s;aid to e|very Head&mdash;But as the&s;e Sheets can by no means contain the Full of the Argument, it is propo&s;ed rather by way of Query, in which the judicious Reader will &s;ee the fol|lowing things. 1. That there does not &s;eem the &s;ame Rea&s;ons now, which were good Rea&s;ons then for re&s;olving to make no Peace, till the whole undivided Monarchy of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hall be re&s;tored to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au|&s;tria</HI>&mdash;This Difference ari&s;ing from the Death of the Late Emperour <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> by which means an exorbitant Power and Greatne&s;s will accrue to King <HI>Charles,</HI> who
<PB N="42" REF="43">
is now likely to be cho&s;en Emperour; and in the Nature of the Grand Alliance ought not al&s;o to enjoy the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Domi|nions both in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> which would be a Power far too great for the re&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> and as K. <HI>William</HI> &s;aid (when Prince of <HI>Orange)</HI> would give us rea&s;on to be as much <HI>Frenchmen</HI> as we a re now <HI>Spani|ards. Vide Sr.</HI> Wm. Temple<HI>'s Memoirs. P.</HI> 82.</P>
<P>Seeing then that the Circum&s;tances of things are alter'd, the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ities, and the &s;ame Conveniences, do not &s;ub&s;i&s;t as In|ferences. 2. Here al&s;o we may ob&s;erve, the &s;ame de&s;tructive Pro&s;pect of our Commerce does not appear, under an Expedient ne|ver before thought of <HI>(viz)</HI> Of putting the Queen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Part of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions in <HI>America, to wit,</HI> In the Kingdoms of <HI>Chili</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> with a Tariff of Trade &s;ecured to us in both <HI>Old Spain</HI> and <HI>New.</HI> The&s;e things de|&s;troy the Nece&s;&s;ity that has all along been upon us to reduce <HI>Old Spain</HI> into the Obe|dience of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> which was made nece&s;&s;ary as to <HI>Britain,</HI> meerly for the Security of our Commerce, the Export and Con&s;umption of our Manufactures, and the Employment of our Poor; all which will be effectually provided by entirely put|ting into our hands &s;uch a Branch of Trade, as is much more than equivalent to all the Trade we can expect to lo&s;e by <HI>France</HI> brea|king
<PB N="43" REF="44">
in upon our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Trade. So that leaving <HI>Spain</HI> now in the Hands of <HI>Philip</HI> V. is not altogether &s;o Fatal a thing as &s;ome have &s;ugge&s;ted, or as it appear'd to be before the Death of the late Emperour.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Author of this believing, that every one will grant a Partition of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, ap|pears much more rea&s;onable than ever it did before, and the only Medium or Expedient to put an End to the Calami|ties of <HI>Europe,</HI> Humbly offers Two Schemes, in which Matters &s;tand &s;o fairly, and &s;o equally Divided, that if it &s;tands as an Alternative to either Side, it may perhaps be a Difficulty to either Party which Part to take, and which Part to refu&s;e, and the Advantage be &s;o little on either Side, as that <HI>Europe</HI> it &s;elf cannot find Rea&s;on to Complain in general of any unju&s;t Breach upon the Ballance of Power, &s;o as to en&s;lave one Side to the other.</P>
<P>Here follow,</P>
<P>Two &s;everal Schemes of a Partition of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy, which may either Way be the Ground of a &s;afe and la&s;ting Peace in <HI>Europe,</HI> and in which Divi&s;ion the Exorbitant Power of either the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> or the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> are pro|vided again&s;t.</P>
