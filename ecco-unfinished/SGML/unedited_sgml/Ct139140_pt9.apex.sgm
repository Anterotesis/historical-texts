<P>IN every &s;ociety, whether of men or of the lower animals, vi&oacute;lence formed tyrants, mild authority con&s;titutes kings. The lion and the tiger on the earth, the eagle and vulture in the
<PB N="2" REF="8">
air, reign amid&s;t the horrors of war, extend their domination by cruelty and the abu&s;e of force. While the Swan upholds his &s;tately empire on the water in gentlene&s;s and peace. Endowed with &s;trength and vigour, and courage, but re&s;trained by a &s;en&s;e of moderation and ju&s;tice, he knows to fight and conquer, yet never urges an attack. Pacific king of the water-birds, he braves the tyrants of the air: he expects the eagle, without provoking and without fearing the rencounter. He repels his a&s;&s;aults, oppo&s;es to his talons the re&s;i&s;tance of his feathers and the rapid &s;trokes of a vigorous wing, which &s;erves him as an <HI>aegis</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld and Aldrovandus.</NOTE>; and often does victory crown his exertions <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, <HI>Hi&s;t.

He lives rather the friend than the monarch amid&s;t the numerous tribes of aquatic birds, which all &s;ubmit to his law. He is only the chief, the principal inhabitant of a peaceful republic <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The ancients believed that the Swans &s;pared not only the birds but even the fi&s;hes; which He&s;iod indicates in his Shield of Hercules, by repre&s;enting fi&s;hes &s;wimming at e&agrave;&s;e be&s;ide the Swan.</NOTE>; nor have its citizens aught

to fear from a ma&s;ter who exacts no more than he grants, and who&s;e &s;ole wi&s;h is to enjoy tran|quillity and freedom.</P>
<P>The graces of figure, the beauty of &s;hape, correspond in the Swan to the mildne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition: he plea&s;es every eye; he decorates, embelli&s;hes every place that he frequents; he is beloved, extolled, admired <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Interest," &s;ays M. Baillon, <Q>&startq;which has di&s;po&s;ed man to &s;ubdue the quadrupeds and tame the birds, has had no part in the dome&s;tication of the Swan. Its beauty, and the elegance of its form, have engaged him to bring it to his habitation, merely to decorate it. It has always had more attention paid it than its fellow &s;ubjects; it has never been kept captive; it has been de&s;|tined to adorn the pieces of water in his gardens, and there per|mitted to enjoy all the &s;weets of liberty.... The abundance and the choice of food have augmented the bulk of the tame &s;wan; but its form has lo&s;t none of its elegance; it has pre&s;erved the &s;ame graces and the &s;ame freedom in all its motions; its maje&s;tic port is ever-admired; I doubt even whether all the&s;e qualities are found to equal extent in the wild bird.&endq;</Q> <HI>Note communicated by M.

<P>Proud of his &s;uperiority, and emulous of di&s;|tinction, the Swan &s;eems forward to unveil his beauties; &s;eeks to charm the &s;pectators, and to command their applau&s;e. And the &s;ight indeed captivates the eye, whether we behold the wing|ed fleet at a di&s;tance gliding through the water, or view one, invited by &s;ignals <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Swan &s;wims with much grace and rapidity when he choo&s;es; he comes to tho&s;e who call him. <HI>Salerne.</HI> The &s;ame au|thor &s;ays, that this call is the word <HI>godard.</HI> According to Fri&s;ch, he an&s;wers to the name <HI>Frank.</HI></NOTE>, approach the &s;hore, and di&s;play his elegance and grace by a thou&s;and &s;oft, &s;weet, undulating motions <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aldrovandus.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To the endowments be&s;towed by nature, the Swan joins the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of liberty. He is none of tho&s;e &s;laves which we can con&s;train or impri&s;on <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">A Swan confined in the court-yard is always melancholy; the gravel hurts his feet; he makes every effort to e&s;cape, which he would certainly effect, were not his wings clipt at each moult. <Q>&startq;I have &s;een one, &s;ays M. Baillon, which lived in this condition three years; it was re&s;tle&s;s and dejected, always lean and &s;ilent, in&s;omuch that its voice was never heard; it was plentifully fed however with bread, bran, oats, crabs, and fi&s;h; it flew away when its wings were neglected to be clipt.&endq;</Q></NOTE>. Even on our artificial lakes, he retains &s;o much of the &s;pirit of independence as to exclude every idea of &s;ervitude and capti|vity

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tame Swan likes freedom, and will not be confined. <HI>Salerne.</HI></NOTE>. He roves at will on the water, lands on the &s;hore, wanders to a di&s;tance, or &s;helters him&s;elf under the brink; lurks among the ru&s;hes, or retires to the remote&s;t inlets: then, leaving &s;o|litude, he returns to &s;ociety and to the enjoy|ment which he receives by approaching man; provided we are ho&s;pitable and friendly, not har&s;h and tyrannical.</P>
<P>Among our ance&s;tors, too &s;imple or too wi&s;e to fill their gardens with the frigid beauties of art, in&s;tead of the lively beauties of nature, the Swans formed the ornament of every piece of water <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This ta&s;te was not unknown to the ancients; the tyrant Gelo con&s;tructed at Agrigentum a pool for feeding Swans. <HI>Aldro|vandus.</HI></NOTE>.

We may at pre&s;ent enjoy the &s;ame &s;pectacle on the fine waters of Chantilly, where the Swans are the chief ornament of that truly delicious place, of which every thing be&s;peaks the noble ta&s;te of its owner.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="13">
The Swan &s;wims &s;o fa&s;t, that a man, walking with ha&s;ty &s;trides along the banks, can hardly keep pace with it. What Albin &s;ays of this bird "that it &s;wims well, walks ill, and flies in|"differently," is true only of the flight of the Swan degraded by dome&s;tication; for when free, and e&s;pecially when wild, it flies very loftily and vigorou&s;ly. He&s;iod gives it the epithet of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> that flies to the clouds.</NOTE>: Homer cla&s;&s;es it with the great migratory birds, the cranes and the gee&s;e <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Iliad ii.</NOTE>; and Plutarch attributes to two Swans what Pindar &s;ung of two eagles, that Jupiter di&s;patched them from the oppo&s;ite extremities of the world, to di&s;cover the middle by their meet|ing.</P>
<P>The Swan, &s;uperior in every re&s;pect to the goo&s;e, which lives only on herbs and grain, pro|cures it&s;elf a rarer and more delicate food <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Swan lives on grain and fi&s;h, particularly eels; it &s;wal|lows al&s;o frogs, leeches, and water &s;lugs; it dige&s;ts as quickly as the duck, and eats largely. <HI>M. Baillon.</HI></NOTE>. It continually practi&s;es wiles to en&s;nare and catch fi&s;h: it a&s;&s;umes a thou&s;and different attitudes, and draws every po&s;&s;ible advantage from its dexterity and &s;trength. It evades or even re&s;i&s;ts its enemies: an old Swan fears not in the water the &s;tronge&s;t dog: a &s;troke of its wing could break a man's leg, &s;o violent it is, and &s;o &s;udden. Nor does the Swan dread any ambu&s;h or any

It can avoid the blows which its enemies aim at it. If a ravenous bird threatens the young, the parents will defend them intrepidly; they range round them, and the plunderer dares not to approach: if dogs a&s;&s;ail them, they go before and make an attack. The Swan dives and e&s;capes if the force of its enemy prove &s;uperior to the re&s;i&s;tance which it can make. The Swans are &s;eldom ever &s;urprized by foxes and wolves, but in the darkne&s;s of night and during &s;leep.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The wild Swans fly in great flocks, and the tame Swans likewi&s;e walk and &s;wim in com|pany <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, <HI>lib.</HI> viii. 12.</NOTE>. Every thing marks their &s;ocial in|&s;tinct; and that in&s;tinct, the &s;weete&s;t in nature, be&s;peaks innocent manners, peaceful habits, and that delicate and &s;en&s;ible di&s;po&s;ition which &s;eems to be&s;tow on the actions that flow from it, the merit of moral qualities <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Aelian.&mdash;Ari&s;totle.&mdash;Bartholin.</NOTE>.

All ob&s;ervers a&s;cribe to it prodigious longevity: &s;ome repre&s;ent it as even pa&s;&s;ing the term of three centuries; which mu&s;t cer|tainly be an exaggeration. But Willughby &s;aw a goo&s;e, which was proved to have lived an hundred years; and he concludes from analogy that the period of the Swan mu&s;t extend farther; both becau&s;e it is larger, and becau&s;e its eggs require longer time to hatch: for incubation in

birds corre&s;ponds to ge&s;tation in quadrupeds, and bears &s;ome relation, perhaps, to the body's growth, which is proportional to the duration of life.

<P>Belon reckons the Swan to be the large&s;t of the aquatic birds; which is true, excepting, however, that the pelican has a much greater alar extent, that the albatro&s;s is as bulky, and that the flamingo is taller on its legs.

The female is, in every dimen&s;ion, rather &s;maller than the male.</P>
<P>The bill u&s;ually exceeds two inches in length, and, in the tame kind, has above its ba&s;e a fle&s;hy tubercle, inflated and prominent, which gives a &s;ort of expre&s;&s;ion: this tubercle is covered with a black &s;kin; and the &s;ides of the face, under the eyes, are covered with a &s;kin of the &s;ame colour. In cygnets of the dome&s;tic breed, the bill is of a leaden ca&s;t, and afterwards becomes yellow or white, with the point black. In the wild kind, the bill is entirely black, with a yellow mem|brane on the front: its form &s;eems to be copied in the two mo&s;t numerous families of the pal|mipede birds, the gee&s;e and ducks. In all of the&s;e the bill is flat, thick, indented at the edges,

The fir&s;t note is &s;hort and tran&s;ient, and has the effect of that which our mu&s;icians call <HI>&s;en&s;ible;</HI> &s;o that it is not detached from the &s;econd, but &s;eems to <HI>&s;lip</HI> into it. Ob&s;erve that, fortunately for the ear, they do not both &s;ing at once; in fact, if while the male &s;ounded B flat, the female &s;truck A, or if the male uttered A, while the fe|male gave G &s;harp, there would re&s;ult the har&s;he&s;t and mo&s;t in|&s;upportable of di&s;cords. We may add, that this dialogue is &s;ub|jected to a con&s;tant and regular rhythm, with the mea&s;ure of two times. The in&s;pector a&s;&s;ured me that, during their amours, the&s;e birds have a cry &s;till &s;harper, but much more agreeable.&endq;</Q>&mdash;We &s;hall add an intere&s;ting ob&s;ervation which was communicated to us after the fir&s;t pages of this article were printed. <Q>&startq;There is a &s;ea|&s;on when the Swans a&s;&s;emble together, and form a &s;ort of common|wealth; it is during &s;evere colds.

Their efforts are &s;o effectual, that there are few in&s;tances of a flock of Swans having quitted the water in the longe&s;t fro&s;ts, though a &s;ingle Swan, which has &s;trayed from the general body, has &s;ometimes been arre&s;ted by the ice in the middle of the canals.&endq;</Q> <HI>Extract of a note drawn up by M.

It is proper to ob&s;erve that there were two ganders, a gray and a white, with three females: the&s;e two males were perpetually contending for the company of the&s;e three dames; when one or the other prevailed, he a&s;&s;umed the direction of them, and hindered the other from approaching. He who was ma&s;ter during the night, would not yield in the morning; and the two gallants fought &s;o furiou&s;ly, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to run and part them. It happened one day, that, being drawn tothe bottom of the gar|den by their cries, I found them with their necks entwined, &s;trik|ing their wings with rapidity and a&s;toni&s;hing force; the three fe|males turned round, as wi&s;hing to &s;eparate them, but without effect; at la&s;t the white gander was wor&s;ted, overthrown, and mal|treated by the other: I parted them, happily for the white one, which would have lo&s;t his life. Then the gray gander &s;et a &s;creaming and gabbling and clapping his wings, and ran to join his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, giving each a noi&s;y &s;alute, to which the three dames replied, ranging them&s;elves at the &s;ame time round him. Mean|while poor <HI>Jacquot</HI> was in a pitiable ca&s;e, and retiring, &s;adly he vented at a di&s;tance his doleful cries: it was &s;everal days before he recovered from his dejection, during which time I had occa|&s;ion to pa&s;s through the court where he &s;tayed; I &s;aw him always thru&s;t out from &s;ociety, and each time I pa&s;&s;ed he came gabbling to me, no doubt to thank me for the &s;uccour which I had given him on his defeat. One day he approached &s;o near me, &s;howing &s;o much friend&s;hip, that I could not help care&s;&s;ing him by &s;trok|ing with my hand his back and neck, to which he &s;eemed &s;o &s;en|&s;ible as to follow me into the entrance of the court. Next day as I again pa&s;&s;ed, he ran to me, and I gave him the &s;ame care&s;&s;es, with which he could not be &s;urfeited; but he &s;eemed by his ge&s;|tures to de&s;ire that I &s;hould lead him to his dear mates; I accord|ingly did lead him to their quarter, and upon his arrival he be|gan his vociferations, and directly addre&s;&s;ed the three dames, who failed not to an&s;wer him. Immediately the gray victor &s;prung upon <HI>Jacquot,</HI> I left them for a moment; he was always the &s;tronger; I took part with my <HI>Jacquot,</HI> who was under; I &s;et him over his rival, he was thrown under; I &s;et him up again: in this way they fought eleven minutes, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which I gave, he obtained the advantage over the gray gander, and got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the three dames. When my friend <HI>Jacquot</HI> &s;aw him|&s;elf ma&s;ter, he would not venture to leave his females, and there|fore no longer came to me when I pa&s;&s;ed; he only gave me at a di&s;tance many tokens of friend&s;hip, &s;houting and clapping his wings, but would not quit his prey, for fear that another &s;hould take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Things went on in this way till the breeding &s;ea&s;on, and he never gabbled to me but at a di&s;tance: when his females however began to &s;it, he left them and redoubled his friend&s;hip to me. One day having followed me as far as the ice|hou&s;e at the top of the park, the place where I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily part with him in pur&s;uing my way to the Wood of Orangis, at half a league's di&s;tance, I &s;hut him in the park: he no &s;ooner &s;aw him&s;elf &s;eparated from me than he vented &s;trange cries.

Our expedi|tion la&s;ted from ten o'clock in the morning till eight in the even|ing, and yet my companion followed me through all the wind|ings of the wood, without &s;eeming to be tired. After this he fol|lowed and attended me every where, &s;o as to become trouble|&s;ome, I not being able to go to any place without his tracing my &s;teps, &s;o that one day he came to find me in the church: another time, as he was pa&s;&s;ing by the rector's window, he heard me talk|ing in the room; and as he found the door open, he entered, climbed up the &s;tairs, and marching in, he gave a loud bur&s;t of&endq; joy, to the no &s;mall affright of the rector.</Q></P> <P><Q>&startq;I am &s;orry, in relating &s;uch plea&s;ing traits of my good and faithful friend <HI>Jacquot,</HI> when I think that it was my&s;elf that fir&s;t di&s;&s;olved the &s;weet friend&s;hip: but it was nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould &s;eparate him by force; poor <HI>Jacquot</HI> fancied him&s;elf as free in the be&s;t apartments as in his own, and after &s;everal accidents of that kind, he was &s;hut up, and I &s;aw him no more.

Surprized at my igno|rance,

they replied that the&s;e birds came from the remote northern lakes; and that every year, on the breaking up of the ice, in the months of March and April, &s;ix or &s;even pairs of Gee&s;e leave each hut of the village, which all take flight in a body, and return not till the beginning of winter, as it is reckoned in Ru&s;&s;ia, that is, at the fir&s;t &s;now; that the&s;e flocks arrive then, increa&s;ed &s;ometimes an hundred-fold, and dividing them&s;elves, each little party &s;eeks, with its new progeny, the hou&s;es where they lived the preceding winter.

Winter, which then begins its reign in the north, determines their migration: and, what is remarkable, the dome&s;tic Gee&s;e, at this &s;ame time, &s;hew by their inquietude, their frequent and long flights, a &s;i|milar de&s;ire to journey <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">My neighbour at Mirande keeps a flock of Gee&s;e, which he every year reduces to fifteen, by &s;elling a part of the old ones, and pre&s;erving a part of the young.

Every day, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the&s;e Gee&s;e take wing, pa&s;s over my gardens, and make a circuit round the plain in their flight, and return not to their roo&s;t till night: they call each other by a cry, which I di&s;tinctly recognized to be that which the wild Gee&s;e repeat in their pa&s;&s;age, to collect and unite their numbers. The month of October has been &s;o mild this year, that the gra&s;s has &s;hot up in the pa&s;ture-grounds; indepen|dently of this abundance of food, the proprietor of this flock gives them grain every evening this &s;ea&s;on, le&s;t he &s;hould lo&s;e a few of them.

The tame Goo&s;e, degraded and incumbered, attempts a pa&s;&s;age, exerci&s;es it&s;elf every day; and, though abundantly pro|vided and wanting for nothing, I could warrant, that if wild ones pa&s;&s;ed at this &s;ea&s;on, they would always lead off &s;ome, and that no|thing but example and a little courage are needed to make them de&s;ert: I doubt not, that if the &s;ame ob&s;ervations were made in the provinces where many Gee&s;e are fed, we &s;hould find that &s;ome are lo&s;t every year, and this in the month of October.

<P>Our fowlers employ all their &s;tratagems to &s;urprize the wild Gee&s;e. If the ground be co|vered with &s;now, they throw a white &s;hirt over their clothes.

<P>A WHITE cravat, wrapped about its black neck, di&s;tingui&s;hes &s;ufficiently this Goo&s;e, which is al&s;o one of tho&s;e peculiar to the north|ern parts of the new world, where at lea&s;t it derives its origin.

<P>The&s;e Cravated Gee&s;e migrate &s;outhwards in America, for they appear during winter in Ca|rolina; and Edwards relates, that in the &s;pring they pa&s;s in flocks to Canada, and thence return to Hud&s;on's Bay, and the other more northern parts of America. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>[A] Specific character of the <HI>Anas Canaden&s;is:</HI> <Q>&startq;It is cine|reous; its head and neck are black; its cheeks and throat white.&endq;</Q> It breeds in Hud&s;on's Bay, and lays &s;ix or &s;even eggs.&mdash;I mu&s;t beg leave to &s;ubjoin the following extract from Mr. Pennant, to who&s;e ingenious and accurate works I have &s;o often been indebted.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Engli&s;h of Hud&s;on's Bay depend greatly on Gee&s;e, of the&s;e and other kinds, for their &s;upport; and, in favourable years, kill three or four thou&s;and, which they &s;alt and barrel. Their arrival is impatiently attended; it is the harbinger of the &s;pring, and the month named by the Indians <HI>the goo&s;e moon.</HI> ... They prefer i&s;lands to the continent, as further from the haunts of men.... The Engli&s;h &s;end out their &s;ervants, as well as the Indians, to &s;hoot the&s;e birds on their pa&s;&s;age. It is in vain to pur&s;ue them; they therefore form a row of huts made of boughs, at mu&s;quet|&s;hot di&s;tance from each other, and place them in a line acro&s;s the va&s;t mar&s;hes of the country. Each hovel, or as they are called, <HI>&s;tand,</HI> is occupied by only a &s;ingle per&s;on: the&s;e attend the flight of the birds, and on their approach mimic their cackle &s;o well, that the Gee&s;e will an&s;wer, and wheel and come nearer the &s;tand. The &s;port&s;man keeps motionle&s;s, and on his knees, with his gun cocked the whole time, and never fires till he has &s;een the eyes of the Gee&s;e. He fires as they are going from him, then picks up another gun that lies by him, and di&s;charges that. The Gee&s;e which he has killed he &s;ets up on &s;ticks as if alive, to de|coy others; he al&s;o makes artificial birds for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. In a good day (for they fly in very uncertain and unequal num|bers) a &s;ingle Indian will kill two hundred. Notwith&s;tanding every &s;pecies of Goo&s;e has a different call, yet the Indians are&endq; admirable in their imitation of every one.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The vernal flight of the Gee&s;e la&s;ts from April to the middle of May. Their fir&s;t appearance coincides with the thawing of the &s;wamps, when they are very lean.

Its bill is rather narrow, and pretty &s;hort; its head is &s;mall, and its neck long and &s;lender: the&s;e two parts, and al&s;o the top of the brea&s;t, are of a blacki&s;h brown, except a very narrow white band, which forms a half-collar under the throat; a charac|ter which leads Belon to find a name relating to this bird in Ari&s;tophanes.

<P><Q>&startq;The Brents were hardly known on the coa&s;ts of Picardy before the winter of 1740. The north wind then brought a prodigious number of them; the &s;ea was covered with them: all the mar&s;hes being frozen, they &s;pread over the land, and committed great de&s;truction among the tender corn, which was not &s;heltered by the &s;now; they devoured the &s;hoots to the very roots. The country peo|ple, who&s;e fields were expo&s;ed to this deva&s;ta|tion, declared a general war again&s;t the&s;e birds. They approached the Brents very near the fir&s;t days, and killed many with &s;ticks and &s;tones. But they &s;eemed as it were to ri&s;e again; for new flocks continued to pour in from the &s;ea, and to de&s;troy what plants the fro&s;t had &s;pared.&endq;</Q>.......</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Others appeared in 1765, and the &s;ea|&s;hore was covered with them. But the north wind, which had brought them, cea&s;ing to blow, they did not di&s;per&s;e in the fields, but&endq; departed a few days after.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Since that time, they have been &s;een every

winter when the north winds blow con&s;tantly twelve or fifteen days. Many appeared in the beginning of 1776; but the ground being covered with &s;now, mo&s;t of them remained on the &s;ea; and the re&s;t, which had entered the rivers, or &s;pread on the banks, a &s;hort di&s;tance from the coa&s;t, were compelled to return by the ice floated in the &s;treams or heaped up by the tide.

In the breeding &s;ea&s;on, &s;ome male Eiders are &s;een flying &s;ingle: The Norwegians call them <HI>gield-fugl, gield-aee</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">i. e. <HI>Free bird; free Eider.&mdash;T.</HI></NOTE>; they are &s;uch as have not obtained mates, and have been wor&s;ted in the &s;truggles for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the females, which are fewer in this &s;pecies than the males. Yet they &s;ooner arrive at maturity, &s;o that the old males and the young females pair together, and hence their fir&s;t hatch is &s;maller than the &s;ub&s;e|quent.</P>
<P>At the time of pairing, the male continually &s;creams <HI>ha, ho,</HI> with a raucous and moaning voice; that of the female re&s;embles the cry of a common duck. The fir&s;t object of the&s;e birds is to place their ne&s;t under &s;helter of &s;ome &s;tones or bu&s;hes, and particularly of junipers. Both male and female labour in concert; and the latter pulls the down from her brea&s;t, and heaps it, &s;o as to form quite round the ne&s;t a thick puffed roll, which &s;he pre&s;&s;es on the eggs, when &s;he goes in que&s;t of food: for the male a&s;&s;i&s;ts not in covering, but keeps watch in the vicinity, and gives notice if an enemy appears; the female then conceals her head, and if the danger is ur|gent, &s;he flies to her mate, who treats her har&s;hly, it is &s;aid, if any accident happen to the brood. The ravens &s;uck the eggs, and kill the young; the mother therefore ha&s;tens to remove them from the ne&s;t, and a few hours after they are hatched,
<PB N="96" REF="109">
&s;he takes them on her back, and, with an ea&s;y flight, tran&s;ports them to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The male now leaves her, and neither of them returns more to land. Several hatches unite at &s;ea, and form flocks of twenty or thirty with their mothers, which lead them, and conti|nually da&s;h the water, to bring up, with the mud and &s;ediment, in&s;ects and &s;mall &s;hell-fi&s;h for &s;uch of the young as are too weak to dive them&s;elves. This happens from the month of July, or even June; and the Greenlanders reckon the time of &s;ummer by the age of the young Eiders.</P>
<P>It is not until the third year that the male ac|quires regular and di&s;tinct colours: tho&s;e of the female are much &s;ooner unfolded; and in every re&s;pect the growth of the male is more rapid than that of the female. Both of them are at fir&s;t co|vered or clothed with a blacki&s;h down.</P>
<P>The Eider dives very deep after fi&s;h, and feeds al&s;o on mu&s;cles and other &s;hell-fi&s;h, and &s;eems very keen upon the garbage which the fi&s;hermen throw out of their barks. The&s;e birds remain on the &s;ea the whole winter, even near Green|land, &s;eeking the parts of the coa&s;t mo&s;t clear of ice, and returning to land only in the evening, or previous to a &s;torm, which their flight to the coa&s;t during the day, it is &s;aid, infallibly fore|bodes.</P>

to glide through the ocean or plunge under its billows, the aquatic birds &s;eemed de&s;tined by nature to live for ever remote from our &s;oci|ety, and from the limits of our dominion.</P>
<P>Their only tie to the land is the nece&s;&s;ity of depo&s;iting the fruit of their loves. By availing our&s;elves of that nece&s;&s;ity, and of the feeling which &s;o powerfully animates all creatures, we have en&s;laved them without impo&s;ing con&s;traint; and by their fondne&s;s to their offspring we have attached them to our abodes.</P>
<P>Eggs, taken from the reeds and ru&s;hes amid&s;t water, and &s;et under an adopted mother, fir&s;t produced, in our farm-yards, wild, &s;hy, fugitive birds, perpetually roving and un&s;ettled, and im|patient to regain the abodes of liberty. But after they had ta&s;ted the plea&s;ures of love in the dome&s;tic a&s;ylum, the &s;ame fowls, and more e&s;pe|cially their de&s;cendants, grew gentler and more tractable, and, under our care and protection, bred the tame &s;orts: for it is a general remark, that, till animals propagate in the dome&s;tic &s;tate, &s;ome individuals may be en&s;laved, but the &s;pe|cies will pre&s;erve their independence. If, in &s;pite of their irk&s;ome bondage, the pa&s;&s;ion, which unites the &s;exes, kindles and dilates, it will &s;weeten their condition, and impart all the charms of freedom: they forget, they relinqui&s;h the pre|rogatives of the &s;avage &s;tate: and the &s;cene of their fir&s;t plea&s;ures, of their early loves, that &s;cene, &s;o dear to every feeling creature, becomes
<PB N="102" REF="118">
their favourite abode. The education of the fa|mily farther augments this attachment, and, at the &s;ame time, communicates it to the young, which, being citizens by birth of the re&s;idence adopted by their parents, never &s;eek to change it. They know not other &s;ituations, and they contract a warm predilection for the place of their nativity; a pa&s;&s;ion felt even by &s;laves.</P>
<P>Yet have we &s;ubjugated only a &s;mall portion of the whole &s;pecies, particularly in tho&s;e birds which nature, be&s;towing a double privilege, has de&s;tined to rove in the air and on the &s;ea. Some, indeed, have become our captives, but the bulk of them have eluded our attempts, and will for even pre&s;erve their independence.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of the Duck and that of the goo&s;e, are thus divided into two great tribes; of which the one, long &s;ince tamed, propagates in our court-yards, forming one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful and mo&s;t numerous families of our poul|try; and the other, no doubt &s;till more exten|&s;ive, con&s;tantly avoids us, and lives on the water, only vi&s;iting us in winter, and retiring in the &s;pring, to breed in the di&s;tant, &s;eque&s;tered re|gions of the north.</P>
<P>It is about the 15th of October that the Ducks begin to appear in France <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At lea&s;t in our northern provinces; their appearance is later in the &s;outhern countries: at Malta, for example, as we are a&s;&s;ured by the Commander De&s;mazy, they are not &s;een till November.</NOTE>. At fir&s;t, their flocks are &s;mall and unfrequent; but the&s;e
<PB N="103" REF="119">
are &s;ucceeded in November by more numerous bodies. The&s;e birds are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the oblique lines and regular triangles which they form in the air. After they have all arrived from the northern countries, they are &s;een continually flying from one pool or river to another. Now is the time when the fowlers make great cap|tures, by watching in the day, by lying in am|bu&s;h at night, or by employing different &s;nares or large nets. But all the&s;e methods of &s;urpriz|ing or decoying, mu&s;t be dextrou&s;ly managed, &s;ince Ducks are exceedingly mi&s;tru&s;tful. They never alight till after making &s;everal wheels round the &s;pot; as if their intention were to &s;ur|vey it, and di&s;cover whether an enemy lurked in it. And when they &s;ettle, they take every pre|caution: they bend their flight, and dart ob|liquely on the &s;urface of the water, which they raze and &s;kim; then they &s;wim at large, keeping always at a di&s;tance from the banks. At the &s;ame time, &s;ome of them watch for the public &s;afety, and give alarm when they apprehend danger; in&s;omuch that the &s;port&s;man is often deceived, and &s;ees them ri&s;e before he can fire. Yet if he judges him&s;elf &s;ufficiently near, he need not be precipitate; for as the wild Duck &s;prings vertically <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>, it does not get &s;o &s;oon out of reach as a bird that &s;hoots directly onwards,

po&s;t, he lays projects for the &s;ucceeding even|ing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We owe to M. Bailion the idea and the detail of this &s;ort of &s;port; for which we thank him, and which we &s;hall give in his own words:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;A con&s;iderable number of wild Ducks is taken every winter in our mar&s;hes near the &s;ea; the contrivance employed to decoy them into the nets is very ingenious; it manife&s;tly proves the di&s;|po&s;ition&endq; of the&s;e birds to &s;ociety.</Q> It is this:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>&startq;They choo&s;e in the mar&s;hes a flat covered with about two feet of water, which they con&s;ine with a &s;light bank; the larg|e&s;t and remete&s;t hedges and trees are the be&s;t: on the edge they form an earthen hut well lined with clay at the bottom, and co|vered with &s;ods laid on pla&s;hed branches; there the fowler &s;its,&endq; and his head overtops the hut.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;They &s;tretch in the water, nets like tho&s;e for larks, furni&s;hed with two &s;trong iron bars, which hold them down on the mud;&endq; the extending cords are fixed in the hut.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The fowler fa&s;tens &s;everal Ducks before the nets; and tho&s;e of the wild breed, and procured from eggs gathered in the &s;pring, are the be&s;t: the drakes, with which they are paired in October,&endq; are &s;hut up in a corner of the lodge.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The attentive fowler &s;urveys the horizon on all &s;ides, e&s;pecially towards the north; as &s;oon as he perceives a flock of wild Ducks. he takes one of the drakes, and throws it into the air: this bird flies in&s;tantly to the re&s;t and joins them; the females, over which it pa&s;&s;es, &s;cream and call; if it delays too long to return, a &s;econd is di&s;patched, and often a third; the redoubled cries of the fe|males bring them back, the wild ones follow, and alight with them; the form of the hut &s;ometimes di&s;quiets them, but they in|&s;tantly gain confidence when they &s;ee their betrayers &s;wim &s;e|curely to the females, which are between the hut and the nets: they continue to advance, and the fowler attends the favourable&endq; in&s;tant, and &s;ometimes takes a dozen or more at a &s;ingle draw.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I have always remarked, that the Ducks trained to this &s;port &s;eldom came within the inclo&s;ure of the net, but flew over it, and&endq; knew the &s;pot, though nothing appeared out of the water.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;All the mar&s;h birds, &s;uch as the whi&s;tlers, the &s;hovelers, the teals, the pochards, &amp;c. come to the call of the Ducks, or follow&endq; the betrayers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;This &s;port is practi&s;ed only in moon-light; the mo&s;t favour|able time is the ri&s;ing of that luminary, and an hour before day|break. It is unprofitable, except in northerly or north-ea&s;terly winds, becau&s;e the Ducks then journey, or are in motion to con|gregate. I have &s;een to the amount of an hundred taken by the &s;ame nets in one night. A man of weak con&s;titution, or &s;en&s;ible to cold, could not &s;upport the hard&s;hips in&s;eparable from this &s;ort of fowling: he mu&s;t remain motionle&s;s, and often drenched&endq; the whole night in the middle of the mar&s;hes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I have often &s;een the wild Ducks de&s;cend to the call of the fe|males of their own kind, how elevated &s;oever they might be in the air; the betrayers flew &s;ometimes with them more than a quarter of an hour; each of the fowlers over whom the flock pa&s;&s;es, di&s;patches others to them; they di&s;per&s;e, and each band of traitors leads off a detachment; that of the fowlers which have&endq; wild females is con&s;tantly the large&s;t.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;In general ducking is a &s;educing but laborious &s;port: a per|&s;on mu&s;t brave the rigour of the weather, which, at that &s;ea&s;on, is often &s;evere, his feet &s;oaked in the water, and his toes chilled with the fro&s;t: he mu&s;t patiently wait at night in the hut, or walk out before day on the brooks and the rivulets. I remember to have gone a-ducking every day for a month together, when the weather was exce&s;&s;ively cold, yet re&s;olving with my&s;elf that each excur&s;ion &s;hould be my la&s;t; and to crown my hard&s;hips, I had the mortification to &s;ee my excellent dog drowned, which was caught among the ice.

Of all the provinces in France, Picardy is that wherein the breeding of tame Ducks is mo&s;t attended to, and the catching of the wild ones the mo&s;t profitable; in&s;omuch, that it brings a pretty con&s;iderable revenue to that country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>&startq;A good part of the wild Ducks, and other birds of the &s;ame kind, which &s;upply the markets of Paris, is brought from Picardy. The quantity caught each winter in the two pa&s;&s;ages, is a&s;toni&s;h|ing. This &s;port begins in the Laonois, a few leagues from Laon: from thence to the &s;ea there is a continued chain of mar&s;hes or of meadow, that are overflowed in the winter, the extent &s;carcely le&s;s than thirty leagues: when the rivers Oi&s;e and Serre &s;well over their banks, their waters unite, and cover all the interjacent coun|try. The river Somme likewi&s;e &s;preads over an immen&s;e country in its inundations.

But no where is this &s;pecies of ducking carried on with greater preparation, or more agreeable &s;uc|ce&s;s, than on the beautiful pool of Arminvilliers in Brie.

<P><Q>&startq;On one &s;ide of this pool, &s;haded with reeds and &s;kirted by a &s;mall wood, the water forms a deep creek in the grove, a &s;ort of little &s;hel|tered haven, where perpetual calm prevails. From this haven canals are cut into the heart of the wood, not in &s;traight lines, but in twi&s;t|ed arches: the&s;e, called <HI>horns,</HI> are pretty broad and deep at their mouth, but gradually con|tract both in breadth and depth as they extend
<PB N="111" REF="127">
and wind among the trees, and at la&s;t draw to&endq; a dry point.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The canal, from its origin to near its mid|dle, is covered with a cradle-net, at fir&s;t pretty wide and high, which narrows and de&s;cends as the canal contracts, and terminates at its&endq; point in a weel, which &s;huts like a pur&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Such is the great &s;nare fitted and prepared for the numerous flocks of Ducks, mixed with pochards, golden-eyes, and teals, which come to alight on this pool in the middle of Octo|ber. But to draw them to the creek and the fatal <HI>horns,</HI> required &s;ome &s;ubtle contrivance; and this contrivance has been long concerted&endq; and practi&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;In the mid&s;t of the grove and of the canals, dwells the Ducker, who thrice every day goes from his little hou&s;e to &s;catter the grain, on which he feeds the whole year above an hun|dred Ducks, half tame, half wild, that, &s;wim|ming con&s;tantly in the pool, never fail, at the accu&s;tomed hour, and at the &s;ound of a whi&s;tle, to ri&s;e and fly vigorou&s;ly to the inlet, and wind&endq; up the canals where their food waits them.</Q></P>

Nay, the difference is much more per|ceptible when the wild Duck is brought to our table: its &s;tomach is always rounded, whil&s;t it forms a &s;en&s;ible angle in the tame Duck, which la&s;t is &s;urcharged with fat, while the fle&s;h of the former is delicate and juicy.

<P>The male, in all the water-fowl with a broad bill and palmated feet, is always larger than the female <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon had before made this ob&s;ervation.</NOTE>; contrary to what obtains among the

<P><Q>"The females," &s;ays M. Baillon, &startq;are &s;et to hatch in the hou&s;es; every place agrees with them, for they are much attached to their eggs; they are allowed twenty-five a-piece: &s;ome eggs are al&s;o hatched by turkies and hens, and the young immediately di&s;tri|buted&endq; to the Ducks.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;On the morning after the birth, each inhabitant marks his own; one cuts the fir&s;t nail of the right foot, another, the &s;econd, ano|ther bores a hole in &s;uch a part of the &s;kin of the foot, &amp;c. Every per&s;on retains his mark; it is perpetuated in his family, and known&endq; by the whole village.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;As &s;oon as the ducklings are marked, they are carried with their mothers to the mar&s;h; there they rear them&s;elves, and with|out trouble; it is only nece&s;&s;ary to drive away the ravenous birds, particularly the buzzards, which de&s;troy many. There are per|&s;ons who thus put &s;even or eight hundred in the water every&endq; year.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;At the end of May and later, the inhabitants a&s;&s;emble to take them again with nets; each knows his own; poulterers come from a di&s;tance to buy them: a certain number are always pre&s;erved in the mar&s;h, both to &s;erve in winter as a call to the wild ones, and to multiply the &s;pecies in the &s;pring following; each per&s;on habituates them to return to his hou&s;e; they are attracted by&endq; throwing barley to them, of which they are very fond.</Q></P>

<P><Q>&startq;The&s;e ba&s;tards have u&s;ually their bill longer, their head and neck thicker than the wild ones, but &s;lenderer than the tame;&endq; they are u&s;ually &s;touter, as it happens when breeds are cro&s;&s;ed...</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I have frequently &s;een Ducks perfectly white pa&s;s with flocks of wild ones; the&s;e are probably the de&s;erters... It is not how|ever impo&s;&s;ible but this bird may a&s;&s;ume the white colour in the north; yet I doubt this, becau&s;e it is migratory: it might turn white during the winter, if it remain always, or for a great length of time... but it departs every year at the beginning of autumn, and advancing into the temperate regions, in proportion as the cold is felt, it flies from the cau&s;e which whitens other birds: the more &s;evere the winter, the more numerous are their migrations. We &s;aw white Ducks in 1765 and 1775, but they were only as&endq; one among a thou&s;and.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It is po&s;&s;ible that this colour may be the effect of degeneration, as in other animals; for I have &s;een &s;everal white Ducks that were impotent: the white females, more common than the males, are commonly &s;maller, weaker, and &s;ometimes le&s;s prolific than the re&s;t.

Fortunately a duplicate of the papers of that ob&s;erver, as ingenious as he is laborious, have come into my hands: and we cannot do better than give an extract, but with|out venturing to decide whether this bird is preci&s;ely the whi&s;tling duck.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;The <HI>gingeon,</HI> which at Martinico is termed the <HI>vingeon,</HI> &s;ays the Chevalier De&s;hayes, is a particular kind of duck, which is not di&s;|po&s;ed to make di&s;tant voyages like the wild duck, but u&s;ually limits its excur&s;ions to the pa&s;&s;ing from one pool or mar&s;h to another, or to make depredations of &s;ome field of rice near their haunts. It &s;ometimes perches on trees; but, as far as I could ob&s;erve, this hap|pened only in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, when its ordi|nary retreat during the day was &s;o deluged, that no aquatic plant appeared to conceal or &s;helter it, or when the extreme heat obliged it to &s;eek the cool &s;hade amid&s;t the thick fo|liage.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="149" REF="169">
&startq;One might be tempted to take the <HI>vingeon</HI> for a nocturnal bird, for it is &s;eldom &s;een in the day; but as &s;oon as the &s;un is &s;et, it ri&s;es from among the flags and reeds, and makes for the open &s;ides of the pools, where it dabbles and pa&s;tures like other ducks. It would be difficult to &s;ay how it is employed through the day: we can hardly ob&s;erve it without being perceived. But we may pre|&s;ume that, though it lurks among the reeds, it does not pa&s;s its time in &s;lumber. We may draw this inference from tame <HI>vingeons,</HI> which, like other fowls, &s;eek not to &s;leep in&endq; the day-time, till after they are &s;ated.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The <HI>gingeons</HI> fly in flocks like the ducks, even in the love &s;ea&s;on. This in&s;tinct, which prompts them to a&s;&s;ociate, &s;eems to be pro|duced by fear; and it is &s;aid, that like the gee&s;e, they always plant a &s;entinel, when en|gaged in &s;earch of food. If the guard per|ceives any motion, he gives notice by a parti|cular cry, re&s;embling a cadence or rather a hoar&s;e bleating; in&s;tantly the <HI>gingeons</HI> de&s;i&s;t from their gobbling, rai&s;e their heads, and look with a &s;teady, earne&s;t a&s;pect: if the noi&s;e cea&s;es, they re&s;ume their feeding; but if the &s;ignal is redoubled, and announces real danger, the alarm is communicated by a &s;hrill, pierc|ing cry, they all mount and follow the &s;enti|nel,&endq; who fir&s;t takes flight.</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="150" REF="170">
&startq;The <HI>gingeon</HI> is a noi&s;y bird: when a flock is feeding, a continual murmuring is heard, like a low &s;mothered laugh. This gabbling betrays them, and directs the fowler. Even when they fly, there is always &s;ome one of the body which whi&s;tles; and as &s;oon as they have alighted on the water, their chuckling is re|newed.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;They lay in January; and in March the young are &s;een. Their ne&s;ts are nothing re|markable, except that they contain many eggs. The negroes are very expert at finding the&s;e ne&s;ts, and the eggs hatch well if placed under &s;itting hens. In this way tame <HI>gin|geons</HI> are obtained; but it would be a world of difficulty to dome&s;ticate &s;uch as are taken a few days after their birth: for already they have contracted the wild, &s;hy temper of their parents; while tho&s;e hatched under hens re|ceive a part of the &s;ocial familiar di&s;po&s;ition. The young <HI>gingeons</HI> have more agility and vivacity than ducklings: at fir&s;t they are covered with a brown down; they grow very fa&s;t, and in &s;ix weeks they attain their full &s;ize, and the feathers of the wings begin to&endq; &s;prout</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>&startq;One could not believe to what lengths the wild Wigeons carry the paternal affection. M. le Gardeur, lately member of the Chamber of Agriculture at St. Domingo, and who joins to a very accompli&s;hed mind much knowledge in Natural Hi&s;|tory, a&s;&s;ured me, that he &s;aw them dart with the utmo&s;t rancour, pecking a negro who &s;ought to plunder their brood; they an|noyed him &s;o much as to retard the taking of the young, which in the mean time e&s;caped and concealed them&s;elves as much as was po&s;&s;ible.&endq;</Q> <HI>Sequel of the Memoir of the Chevalier De&s;hayes.</HI></P></NOTE>.</P>

&startq;Thus, with very little pains, we may pro|cure tame <HI>gingeons;</HI> but, if we may judge from almo&s;t all that have, we can &s;carcely ex|pect that they will multiply in the dome&s;tic &s;tate; yet I know &s;ome tame <HI>gingeons</HI> which&endq; have laid, covered, and hatched.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It would be an extremely valuable acqui&s;i|tion to obtain a dome&s;tic breed of the&s;e birds; becau&s;e their fle&s;h is excellent, and e&s;pecially that of &s;uch as have been tamed, not having the mar&s;h ta&s;te of the wild ones. And ano|ther rea&s;on for reducing this &s;pecies to dome&s;|tication, would be the advantage in extin|gui&s;hing, or at lea&s;t of weakening, tho&s;e in the wild &s;tate; for they often de&s;olate our crops, and &s;eldom do the fields of rice, near pools, e&s;cape their ravages. In &s;uch &s;ituations, the &s;port&s;man waits for them in the evening by moon-light: they are al&s;o caught with noo&s;es,&endq; and hooks baited with earth-worms.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The <HI>gingeons</HI> feed not only upon rice, but on all other grain u&s;ually given to fowls; &s;uch as maize and different kinds of millet. They al&s;o crop gra&s;s, and catch &s;mall fi&s;h and&endq; crabs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Their cry is a real whi&s;tle, which may be

<P>THIS is not &s;o large as the wild duck; its head is finely &s;peckled or dotted with dark brown and white, and the blacki&s;h tint predo|minates on the top of the head and the upper &s;ide of the neck; the brea&s;t is richly fe&s;tooned or &s;caled, and the back and the flanks are all vermiculated with the&s;e two colours; on the wing there are three &s;pots or bars, the one white, the other black, and the third of a fine reddi&s;h che&s;nut. M. Baillon has ob&s;erved, that of all the ducks, the Gadwall pre&s;erves the longe&s;t the fine colours of its plumage, but at la&s;t, like the others, it a&s;&s;umes a gray garb after the love &s;ea&s;on. The cry of this duck re&s;embles much that of the wild duck; nor is it more raucous or louder, though Ge&s;ner &s;eems to have meant to characterize it by applying the epithet <HI>&s;trepera;</HI> which has been adopted by ornithologi&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="179">
The Gadwall is as alert in diving as in &s;wim|ming, and it e&s;capes a &s;hot by plunging under water; it &s;eems timorous, and flies little during the day; it lurks &s;quatted among the ru&s;hes, and &s;eeks not its food except early in the morning or in the evening, and even a good while after night has come on. They are then heard flying in company with the whi&s;tlers, and, like the&s;e, are caught by the decoy of tame ducks. <Q>&startq;The Gadwalls," &s;ays M. Baillon, "arrive on our coa&s;ts of Picardy in the month of November, with the north-ea&s;t winds; and when the&s;e winds blow &s;ome days, they pa&s;s on without halting. About the end of February, with the fir&s;t &s;outh winds, they are &s;een repa&s;&s;ing on their&endq; return to the north.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The male is always larger and more beau|tiful than the female; like the male pochards and whi&s;tlers, it has the under &s;ide of the tail black, which part of the plumage is in the&endq; females con&s;tantly gray.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The females bear great re&s;emblance in all the&s;e &s;pecies; yet &s;ome practice will enable us to di&s;tingui&s;h them. The female Gadwalls become of an inten&s;e rufous as they grow&endq; old.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The bill of this bird is black; its legs are of a pale clay-yellow, with black membranes, and the under &s;ide of each joint of the toes is al&s;o black. The male mea&s;ures twenty inches from the bill to the tail, and nineteen inches
<PB N="159" REF="180">
to the extremity of the nails; its alar extent is thirty inches. The female differs only fif|teen&endq; lines in all the dimen&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>"I fed in my court &s;everal months," conti|nues Baillon, &startq;two Gadwalls, male and female: they would eat no grain, but &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on bran and &s;oaked bread. I had al&s;o wild ducks which refu&s;ed grain, and others which lived on barley from the fir&s;t days of their confine|ment. This difference, I imagine, is owing to the nature of the places where the&s;e birds were bred: tho&s;e which come from the de|&s;ert mar&s;hes of the north mu&s;t be unac|quainted with barley and wheat, and therefore it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that they &s;hould reject &s;uch food: tho&s;e, on the contrary, which were hatched in cultivated countries, are led in the night into the corn-fields by their parents; they are thus accu&s;tomed to live on grain, and readily recognize it in the farm-yard; while the others will often die of want, though the re&s;t of the poultry, picking up the &s;eeds before them, might in&s;truct them in the u&s;e of this food.&endq;</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Gadwall, <HI>Anas Strepera:</HI> <Q>&startq;It has on its wing a &s;peckle of rufous, of black, and of white.&endq;</Q></NOTE></P>

M. Baillon a&s;&s;ures us, that the old Shovelers retain &s;ometimes their beautiful co|lours, and that tinged feathers grow at the &s;ame time with the gray, which cover them every year after the love &s;ea&s;on: and he ob&s;erves ju&s;tly, that this &s;ingularity of the Shovelers and gadwalls may mi&s;lead nomenclators with re&s;pect to the number of the &s;pecies of the&s;e birds. He &s;ays al&s;o, that aged females, which he &s;aw, had, like the males, colours on their wings, but that, during their fir&s;t year, they were entirely gray. Their head retains always its colour. We &s;hall here al&s;o give the excellent remarks which he has obligingly communicated on the Shoveler in particular.</P>
<P><Q>"The form of the bill of this beautiful bird," &s;ays M. Baillon, &startq;denotes its manner of living; its two broad mandibles have edges fur|ni&s;hed with a &s;ort of indenting or fringe, that allows only the dirt to e&s;cape, but holds the worms, the &s;lender in&s;ects, and the cru&s;ta|ceous animals, which it &s;earches among the mud by the margin of water: it has no other food <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We mu&s;t add flies, which it catches alertly as it flutters on the water; whence the name <HI>Anas Mu&s;caria,</HI> which Ge&s;ner has given to it.</NOTE>. I have &s;everal times opened them at
<PB N="162" REF="184">
the end of winter and during fro&s;t; I found no herbage in their &s;tomach, though the want of in&s;ects mu&s;t have obliged them to recur to that &s;pecies of food. They are found then near &s;prings only: they grow very lean: they recruit again in the &s;pring, by eating&endq; frogs.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Shoveler dabbles ince&s;&s;antly, chiefly in the morning and evening, and even very late at night: I think that it &s;ees in the du&s;k. It is &s;avage and gloomy: it can &s;carce be reconciled to dome&s;tication: it con&s;tantly rejects bread and grain. I had a great num|ber, which died after having been long fed by cramming into the bill, without ever learning to eat by them&s;elves. I have at pre&s;ent two in my garden, which I have fed in that way more than a fortnight. They are now living on bread and &s;hrimps: they &s;leep almo&s;t the whole day, and lie &s;quat by the box-borders: in the evening, they run about a great deal, and they bathe repeatedly in the night. It is a pity that &s;o beautiful a bird has not the cheer|fulne&s;s of the garganey or &s;heldrake, and cannot become an inhabitant of our court-yards.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Shovelers arrive in our di&s;tricts about the month of February. They di&s;per&s;e in the mar&s;hes, and a part of them hatch there every year. I pre&s;ume that the re&s;t advance towards the &s;outh, becau&s;e the&s;e birds become rare here
<PB N="163" REF="185">
after the fir&s;t northerly winds that blow in March. Tho&s;e which are bred in the coun|try, depart about the month of September: it is very uncommon that any are &s;een in the winter, and I thence conjecture that they&endq; avoid the approach of cold <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However, they are &s;een in Scania and Gothland, according to Linnaeus,</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;They ne&s;tle here in the &s;ame places with the &s;ummer teals; they choo&s;e, like the&s;e, large tufts of ru&s;hes in &s;pots almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;i|ble, and they arrange their ne&s;t after the &s;ame fa&s;hion. The female lays ten or twelve eggs, of a &s;omewhat pale rufous: &s;he covers them twenty-eight or thirty days, as &s;port&s;men have told me; but I am my&s;elf inclined to think, that the incubation la&s;ts only twenty-four or twenty-five days, &s;ince the&s;e birds hold a middle rank between the ducks and&endq; the garganeys, with re&s;pect to &s;ize.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The young are hatched with a gray &s;potted down, like the ducklings, and are extremely ugly. Their bill is then almo&s;t as broad as their body, who&s;e weight &s;eems to oppre&s;s them: they almo&s;t con&s;tantly re&s;t on their brea&s;t. They run and &s;wim as &s;oon as they bur&s;t from the &s;hell. Their parents lead them, and appear attached to them; they ince&s;&s;antly guard again&s;t the ravenous birds: on the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of danger, the family &s;quat among the gra&s;s, and the parents throw them|&s;elves
<PB N="164" REF="186">
&endq;into the water, and plunge over head.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The young Shovelers become fir&s;t gray like the females: the fir&s;t moulting gives them their fine feathers, but they turn bright not until the &s;econd.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the colour of the bill, ob&s;er|vers are not agreed. Ray &s;ays, that it is quite black; Ge&s;ner, as cited by Aldrovandus, a&s;&s;erts, that the upper mandible is yellow; Aldrovandus makes it to be brown: all that we can infer is, that the colour of the bill varies from age or other circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Schwenckfeld compares the clapping of the Shoveler's wings to the clattering of ca&s;tanets; and M. Hebert told us, that he could not better compare its cry, than to the creaking of a hand|rattle, turned round with little &s;hakes. It is likely that Schwenckfeld mi&s;took its voice for the noi&s;e of its flight. The Shoveler is the be&s;t and mo&s;t delicate of the ducks; it grows very fat in winter; its fle&s;h is tender and juicy; this is &s;aid to be always red, though well dre&s;&s;ed, and that the bird has hence received the name of <HI>rouge,</HI> particularly in Picardy, where many are killed in the long chain of mar&s;hes that extend from the vicinity of Soi&s;&s;ons to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;on, following the other ornithologi&s;ts, gives a variety of the Shoveler; but the only difference is, that its belly, in&s;tead of being che&s;t|nut rufous, is white.</P>

&s;nowy-white; on the &s;ides of the neck are two white bars like ribbands, which readily di&s;tin|gui&s;h it, though at a di&s;tance. The proportions of its body are longer and more taper than in any other &s;pecies of duck; the neck is remarkably long, and very &s;lender; the head is &s;mall and che&s;nut-colour; the tail is black and white, and terminates in two narrow filaments, which might be compared to tho&s;e of the &s;wallow; it is not carried horizontally but half-cocked.

<P>WE are convinced that the <HI>fox-goo&s;e</HI> of the ancients (<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <HI>vulpan&s;er)</HI> is the &s;ame with the Sheldrake.

But we may ea&s;ily a&s;certain, from one of tho&s;e natural properties which are more deci&s;ive than all the conjectures of erudition, that the&s;e names apply &s;olely to the Sheldrake; for it is the only bird which re&s;embles the fox in a &s;ingular cir|cum&s;tance, that of lodging in a hole: it u&s;ually invades and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it&s;elf of the rabbits' bur|rows, and there it lays and breeds.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="196">
Aelian a&s;cribes al&s;o to the <HI>vulpan&s;er</HI> the in|&s;tinct of pre&s;enting it&s;elf, like the partridge, be|fore the feet of the &s;port&s;man, to avert the dan|ger from its young. This was the general opinion of the ancients; &s;ince the Egyptians, who ranked this bird among the &s;acred animals, figured it, in their hieroglyphics, as the emblem of the generous tenderne&s;s of a mother <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Pieri, in Orum, <HI>lib.</HI> xx.</NOTE>.

<P>The appellations be&s;towed on this bird in the north, that of <HI>fox-goo&s;e,</HI> or rather <HI>fox-duck</HI> in Germany, that of <HI>mountain-duck</HI> in Saxony, and that of <HI>burrow-duck</HI> in England, mark, equally with the ancient names, its &s;ingular habit of living in burrows the whole time of its incuba|tion. The&s;e appellations are even more accu|rate; &s;ince the Sheldrake belongs to the genus of ducks, not to that of gee&s;e. It is rather larger than the common duck, and its legs are &s;omewhat taller; but in other re&s;pects, in its figure, its port, and its &s;tructure, it pre&s;erves the re&s;emblance. It differs from the duck, only becau&s;e its bill is more rai&s;ed, and the colours of its plumage more vivid and beautiful, and appear more brilliant at a di&s;tance. Its fine plumage is broken into large &s;paces of three colours, white, black, and cinnamon-yellow;
<PB N="173" REF="197">
the head, and as far as the middle of the neck, are black, glo&s;&s;ed with green; the lower part of the neck is encircled by a white collar, and be|low is a broad zone of cinnamon-yellow, which covers the brea&s;t, and forms a little band on the back; this &s;ame colour tinges the lower belly; below the wing, on each &s;ide of the back, a black bar extends on a white ground; the great and middle quills of the wing are black, the &s;mall ones have the &s;ame ground colour, but are glo&s;&s;ed with &s;hining green; the three quills next the body have their outer edge of cinna|mon-yellow, and their inner of white; the great coverts are black, and the &s;mall ones white.

our be&s;t corre&s;pondents, M. Baillon, has &s;tudied the natural habits of the&s;e birds, and made the following ob&s;ervations; which we are happy to publi&s;h.</P>
<P><Q>"The &s;pring," &s;ays M. Baillon, &startq;brings to us the Sheldrakes, but always in &s;mall num|ber. As &s;oon as they arrive, they &s;pread among the &s;and plains near the &s;ea: each pair wanders among the warrens, which are there inter&s;per&s;ed, and &s;eek a burrow among tho&s;e of the rabbits. They &s;eem very nice in choo&s;ing this &s;ort of lodgement, for they enter an hundred before they find one to &s;uit them. It is remarked, that they never fix on a bur|row but &s;uch as &s;inks more than a fathom and a half deep, and runs with an a&s;cent into ridges or hillocks, its mouth opening to the &s;outh, and vi&s;ible from the top of &s;ome di&s;|tant&endq; &s;and-bank.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The rabbits give place to the&s;e new gue&s;ts,&endq; and enter no more.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Sheldrakes make no ne&s;t in the&s;e holes. The female lays her fir&s;t eggs on the naked &s;and, and after &s;he has extruded her comple|ment, which is ten or twelve for young birds, and twelve or fourteen for old ones, &s;he wraps them in a very thin down, which &s;he plucks from her own body.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;During the whole time of incubation, which is thirty days, the male remains con|&s;tantly on the &s;and-bank, and only leaves it
<PB N="176" REF="200">
twice or thrice a-day, to procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence on the &s;ea. In the morning and evening, the female quits her eggs, to provide al&s;o for her wants: then the male enters. the burrow, e&s;pecially in the morning; and on the female's&endq; arrival, he returns to his &s;and bank.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;If in the &s;pring we &s;ee a Sheldrake thus on watch, we may be &s;ure to find the ne&s;t; we have only to wait till the hour when it goes into the burrow. But if it perceive it&s;elf to be di&s;covered, it flies away in the oppo&s;ite direction, and expects its female at &s;ea. In their-return they hover long over the warren,&endq; till the danger is removed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The day after the young are hatched, the parents conduct them to the &s;ea, and u&s;ually adju&s;t matters &s;o that they arrive when the tide is full. By this management, their pro|geny &s;ooner reach the water; and from that moment they appear no more on land. It is difficult to conceive how the&s;e birds can, the fir&s;t days after their birth, pre&s;erve them&s;elves in an element, who&s;e furious waves &s;o often&endq; de&s;troy the adults of all kinds.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;If a fowler meet the little family on their journey, the parents fly away: the mother, however, affects to reel and fall an hundred paces off; &s;he trails on her belly and &s;trikes the earth with her wings, and by this trick &s;he draws the fowler after her. The brood remain motionle&s;s till the return of the pa|rents,
<PB N="177" REF="201">
and if a per&s;on lights on them, he may&endq; take them all; nor will any try to e&s;cape.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I have witne&s;&s;ed all the&s;e facts: I have fre|quently taken, and &s;een taken, the eggs from the Sheldrake's ne&s;t. We dug in the &s;and, following the burrow to its end: there we found the mother &s;itting on her eggs; we car|ried them, with their downy coat, in a thick woollen cloth, and &s;et them under a duck. The adopted mother rears the foreign brood with much care, provided none of her own eggs are left with her. The young Sheldrakes have at fir&s;t their back white and black, and their belly very white. But they &s;oon lo&s;e this livery, and become gray: then the bill and the legs are blue; about the month of Sep|tember they begin to a&s;&s;ume their beautiful feathers; but it is not before the &s;econd year that their colours gain all their lu&s;tre.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I have rea&s;on to think, that the male is not completely grown and fit for propagating before this &s;econd year <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>&startq;The life of the Sheldrake, which is pretty long&punc; &s;eems to confirm the conjecture concerning its &s;low growth: la&s;t winter I had one that died eleven years old; it would have lived longer, but it became very mi&s;chievous, and domineered over all the inha|bitants of the court-yard, except a mu&s;k duck, &s;tronger than it&s;elf, with which it fought ince&s;&s;antly: we thought to pre&s;erve the weaker by &s;hutting it up; but it died a &s;hort time after, ra|ther from the languor of its confinement than from old age.&endq;</Q> <HI>Note of M. Baillon.</HI></P></NOTE>; for it is not till then that the blood-coloured tubercle ap|pears,
<PB N="178" REF="202">
which decorates their bill in the &s;ea|&s;on of love, and at other times is obliterated: this new &s;ort of production &s;eems to have&endq; &s;ome &s;ympathy with the parts of generation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The wild Sheldrake lives on &s;ea-worms, on &s;and-hoppers innumerable, and, no doubt, on fi&s;h-fry, and on little &s;hell-fi&s;h, which are thrown up by the waves, and float on the froth. The rai&s;ed form of its bill gives it great ad|vantage in gathering the&s;e different &s;ub&s;tances, by &s;kimming, &s;o to &s;ay, the &s;urface of the&endq; water, much more lightly than the duck.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The young Sheldrakes reared under a duck are &s;oon reconciled to the dome&s;tic &s;tate, and live in court-yards like the ducks. They are fed with crumbs of bread and with grain. The wild Sheldrakes are never &s;een a&s;&s;embled in flocks, like the ducks, the teals, and the wi|geons. The male and female never part; they are ob&s;erved con&s;tantly together, either on the &s;ea or the &s;ands: they re&s;t &s;atisfied with each other's company; and in pairing they &s;eem to tie an indi&s;&s;oluble knot <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>&startq;Dome&s;tication, which &s;oftens the natural di&s;po&s;ition, at the &s;ame time corrupts it: I &s;aw in my court-yard a male Sheldrake pair two years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively with a light-coloured duck, and yet be|&s;tow always the &s;ame care&s;&s;es on his own female; he was then &s;ix year old. This intercour&s;e produced hybrids, which had nothing of the Sheldrake but the cry, the bill, and the legs; their colours were tho&s;e of the duck; the only difference was, that a yellow tint appeared under the tail. I have kept three years a female of the&s;e hybrids; it has never li&s;tened to the addre&s;&s;es either of the drakes or of the Sheldrakes.&endq;</Q> <HI>Note of M. Baillon.</HI></P></NOTE>. The
<PB N="179" REF="203">
male appears prone to jealou&s;y; and yet, not|with&s;tanding the ardour of the&s;e birds in love, I have never been able to obtain one hatch from any female: one alone laid a few eggs by chance, and they were addle. They are com|monly of a very light flaxen colour, without any &s;pots; they are as large as ducks eggs,&endq; but rounder.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Sheldrake is &s;ubject to a &s;ingular di&s;or|der: the lu&s;tre of its feathers tarni&s;hes, they become dirty and oily, and the bird dies, after langui&s;hing near a month. Being curious to learn the cau&s;e of this malady, I opened &s;eve|ral, and found the blood melted down, and the principal bowels choaked with a reddi&s;h lymph, vi&s;cous and foetid. I attribute the di&s;|ea&s;e to the want of &s;ea-&s;alt, which I believe to be nece&s;&s;ary to the&s;e birds, at lea&s;t from time to time, to divide by its points the red particles of the blood, and to pre&s;erve the union with the <HI>&s;erum,</HI> by di&s;&s;olving the vi&s;|cous humours, whch the &s;eeds that &s;upport them in the court-yards accumulate in the inte&s;tines.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations, detailed by M. Baillon, leave very little to be added to the hi&s;tory of the Sheldrakes. We reared a pair of them under our eyes; they &s;eemed not to have a wild di&s;po|&s;ition; they readily allowed them&s;elves to be caught; they were kept in a garden, where they had liberty during the day; and when they were
<PB N="180" REF="204">
taken and held in the hand, they made &s;carce any efforts to e&s;cape: they ate bread, bran, corn, and even the leaves of plants and &s;hrubs; their ordinary cry was much like that of a duck, but was le&s;s extended and much le&s;s frequent, for they were very &s;eldom heard: they had al&s;o a &s;econd cry, <HI>uute, uute,</HI> which they utter when caught &s;uddenly, and which &s;eemed to be only the expre&s;&s;ion of fear: they bathed very often, e&s;pecially in mild weather, and before rain; they &s;wam rocking on the water, and when they reached the land, they &s;tood on their feet, clapt their wings, and &s;hook them&s;elves like ducks; they al&s;o frequently preened their plumage with the bill. Thus the Sheldrakes, which re&s;emble much the ducks in the &s;hape of their body, re|&s;emble them al&s;o by their natural habits, only they are nimbler in their motions, and di&s;cover more cheerfulne&s;s and vivacity: they have be|&s;ides over all the ducks, even the mo&s;t beauti|ful, a privilege of nature, which belongs to them alone; that is, they retain con&s;tantly, and at all &s;ea&s;ons, the charming colours of their plumage. As they are not difficult to tame, and as their rich garb is con&s;picuous at a di&s;tance, and has a very fine effect on pieces of water, it is to be wi&s;hed that we could obtain a dome&s;tic breed of the&s;e birds: but their temper and con&s;titution &s;eem to fix them on the &s;ea, and to repel them from fre&s;h pools; the experiment could there|fore

<P>THE Pochard is &s;tiled by Belon <HI>the rufous|headed duck.</HI> In fact, its head, and part of its neck, is of a rufous brown, or che&s;nut; that colour cut round at the bottom of the neck, is &s;ucceeded by black or blacki&s;h brown, which is likewi&s;e cut round on the brea&s;t and the top of
<PB N="182" REF="206">
the back: the wing is gray, tinged with blacki&s;h, and without any &s;pangle; but the back and the &s;ides are prettily worked with a very fine fringe, which runs tran&s;ver&s;ely in little black zigzags on a ground of pearl-gray. According to Schwenckfeld, the head of the female is not ru|fous like that of the male, and has only &s;ome ru&s;ty &s;pots.</P>
<P>The Pochard is as large as the &s;heldrake, but is more unwieldy; its round &s;hape gives it a heavy air; it walks with difficulty and ungracefully, and is obliged from time to time to flap its wings, in order to pre&s;erve its equilibrium on land.</P>
<P>Its cry re&s;embles more the hollow hi&s;s of a large &s;erpent than the voice of a bird. Its bill, broad and &s;cooped, is very proper for dabbling in the mud, like the &s;hovelers and the morillons, to &s;earch for worms, &s;mall fi&s;h, and cru&s;taceous ani|mals. Two male Pochards, which M. Baillon kept a winter in his court-yard, remained almo&s;t con&s;tantly in the water; they were very &s;trong and courageous on that element, and would &s;uf|fer none of the other ducks to approach them, but drove them away with their bill. The&s;e, however, in their turn, beat them when they came on land, and the Pochards could then make no defence, but e&s;caped to the water. Though they were tame, and even grown familiar, they could not be long pre&s;erved, becau&s;e they could not walk without hurting their feet; the gravel of the garden-walks were as pernicious as the pave|ment

of the court; and, notwith&s;tanding the care which M. Baillon took of the&s;e two Pochards, they lived not more than &s;ix weeks in their captivity.</P>

<P>M. Hebert, who, as an attentive and even ingenious &s;port&s;man, has found other plea&s;ures in fowling than that of killing, has made on the&s;e birds, as on many others, intere&s;ting ob&s;er|vations. <Q>"It is the &s;pecies of the Pochard," &s;ays he, &startq;which, next to that of the wild duck, appears to me the mo&s;t numerous in the coun|tries where I have gone a-fowling. They ar|rive with us in Brie about the end of Octo|ber, in flocks from twenty to forty. Their flight is more rapid than that of the duck, and the noi&s;e made by their wings is quite different. The troop forms a clo&s;e body in the air, but not di&s;po&s;ed like the wild ducks in triangles. On their arrival, they are re&s;t|le&s;s;
<PB N="184" REF="208">
they alight on the large pools, and, the in&s;tant after, they ri&s;e, make &s;everal wheels in the air; a &s;econd time they alight, but their &s;tay is equally &s;hort; they di&s;appear, and re|turn in an hour, and yet do not &s;ettle. When I killed one, it was always by chance, and with very coar&s;e &s;hot, and when they whirled in the air. They were all remarkable for a large rufous head, whence they are called&endq; <HI>rougeot</HI> in Burgundy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It is not ea&s;y to get near them on the large pools; they alight not on the brooks in fro&s;ty weather, nor on the little pools in autumn; and many of them cannot be killed, except on the <HI>duckeries</HI> of Picardy. However, they are pretty common in Burgundy, and at Dijon they are &s;een in the cooks &s;hops almo&s;t the whole year. I killed one in Brie in the month of July, when the weather was ex|tremely hot: it flu&s;hed at the &s;ide of a pool, in the middle of a wood, and in a very &s;oli|tary &s;pot: it was attended by another, which made me think that they were paired, and that &s;ome couples of this &s;pecies breed in France on the large mar&s;hes.&endq;</Q></P>

"The Golden Eye," adds this attentive ob|&s;erver, &startq;like the pochard and the morillon, walks under con&s;traint and difficulty, with effort, and &s;eeming pain. Yet the&s;e birds come from time to time on &s;hore, but only to remain there in tranquillity and repo&s;e, &s;tanding or lying on the &s;trand, and to enjoy a plea&s;ure which is peculiar to them&s;elves. Land-birds feel the nece&s;&s;ity of bathing at inrervals, whe|ther to clean their plumage of the du&s;t which in&s;inuates into it, or to give dilatation to their body, which facilitates their motions; and they announce, by their chearfulne&s;s on quitting the water, the agreeable &s;en&s;ation which they feel. In the aquatic birds, on the contrary, in tho&s;e which remain long in the water, their feathers become through time penetrated and moi&s;|tened, and permit the humidity to &s;teal in&s;en&s;i|bly to the &s;kin: then they have occa&s;ion for an air bath to dry and contract their relaxed limbs; they come, for this purpo&s;e, on &s;hore, and the &s;prightline&s;s of their eyes, and the &s;low balancing of their head, expre&s;s their agreeable &s;en&s;ation. But the Golden Eyes, and likewi&s;e the pochards and the morillons, are &s;atisfied with that gratifi|cation; they never willingly come to land, and e&s;pecially avoid walking on it, which &s;eems to cau&s;e extreme fatigue: in fact, accu&s;tomed as they are to move in the water by &s;hort darts, produced by the bri&s;k and &s;udden motion of
<PB N="190" REF="214">
their feet, they bring this habit with them on land, and walk by &s;prings, &s;triking the ground &s;o forcibly with their broad feet, that their pace is attended with the &s;ame noi&s;e as the clapping of hands; they u&s;e their wings to pre&s;erve the equilibrium, which they lo&s;e every minute; and if they be ha&s;tened, they make a bound, throwing their legs back, and fall on their brea&s;t: their feet al&s;o are torn and cut in a &s;hort time by rubbing on the gravel.

times they are carried away or rent by por|poi&s;es&endq; or &s;turgeons.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I never &s;aw any Scoters fly any where but above the &s;ea, and I have always remarked that their flight was low and gentle, and of &s;mall compa&s;s: they &s;carce ever ri&s;e, and while on wing their feet often drag in the water. It is probable that the Scoters are as prolific as the ducks, for the number which arrives every year is prodigious; and notwith|&s;tanding the multitudes that are caught, they &s;eem not to dimini&s;h.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Having enquired of M. Baillon his opinion with regard to the di&s;tinction between the male and female of this &s;pecies, and to the gray Scoters or <HI>gri&s;ettes,</HI> which &s;ome have &s;aid to be females; he gave me this an&s;wer:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;The <HI>gri&s;ette</HI> is certainly a Scoter, and has exactly the figure. The&s;e <HI>gri&s;ettes</HI> are always &s;een in company with the other Scoters; they feed on the &s;ame &s;hell-fi&s;h, &s;wallow them en|tire, and dige&s;t them in the &s;ame manner. They are caught in the &s;ame nets, and they fly as badly and in the &s;ame way, and this is peculiar to the&s;e birds, which have the bones of the wings more turned backwards than the ducks, and the cavities, in which the two thigh-bones are &s;unk, very near each other; a &s;tructure which gives them great facility in &s;wimming, and makes them at the &s;ame time very aukward in walking: and &s;urely no &s;pe|cies
<PB N="200" REF="226">
of ducks has the thighs placed in this manner. La&s;tly, the ta&s;te of their fle&s;h is the&endq; &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I opened three of the&s;e <HI>gri&s;ettes</HI> in winter,&endq; and they were found to be females.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;On the other hand, the number of gray Sco|ters is much inferior to that of the black; often not ten occur among an hundred of the others, caught in the &s;ame net. How could&endq; the females be &s;o few in this &s;pecies?</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I freely own that I have not &s;ought &s;uffi|ciently to di&s;tingui&s;h the males from the fe|males. I &s;tuffed a great number; I cho&s;e the blacke&s;t and the large&s;t, and they were all found to be males, except the <HI>gri&s;ettes.</HI> I be|lieve, however, that the females are &s;omewhat &s;maller, and not &s;o black, or at lea&s;t they have not that velvet &s;urface which makes the black of the male plumage &s;o deep.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>It appears to us from this detail, that as the female Scoters are not quite &s;o black as the males, and more inclined to gray, the <HI>gri&s;ettes,</HI> or the Scoters which verge on gray, are too few to re|pre&s;ent all the females of the &s;pecies, and are in fact the younger females, which require time to a&s;&s;ume all the black of their plumage.</P>
<P>After this fir&s;t an&s;wer, M. Baillon &s;ent us al&s;o the following notes, which are all intere&s;ting. <Q>"I have had," &s;ays he, &startq;this year, 1781, for &s;everal months in my court, a black Scoter.
<PB N="201" REF="227">
I fed it with &s;oaked bread and &s;hell-fi&s;h. It&endq; was become very familiar.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I believed till then that the Scoters could not walk, and that their conformation deprived them of that power. I was the more per|&s;uaded, as I had &s;everal times, in &s;torms, ga|thered, on the &s;ea-&s;hore, Scoters, penguins, and puffins alive, which could drag them&s;elves along only by help of their wings. But the&s;e birds had, no doubt, been much beaten by the waves; and that circum&s;tance, which I had overlooked, confirmed me in my error. I was &s;urprized to remark, that the Scoter walks well, and fa&s;ter even than the pochard; it balances it&s;elf in the &s;ame manner at each &s;tep, holding its body almo&s;t erect, and &s;trik|ing the ground with each foot alternately and with force; its pace is &s;low; if pre&s;&s;ed, it tumbles, becau&s;e the efforts which it makes de&s;troys its equilibrium: it is indefatigable in the water; it runs on the waves like a petrel, and as nimbly; but, on land, the celerity of its motions are of no avail; mine &s;eemed&endq; quite out of its natural element.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Indeed, it had a very aukward air; each movement gave its body fatiguing jogs; it walked only from nece&s;&s;ity: it u&s;ually lay down or &s;tood &s;traight like a &s;take, its bill leaning on its &s;tomach: it always &s;eemed to be melancholy: I never once &s;aw it bathe joyous, like the other water-fowls, with which
<PB N="202" REF="228">
my court is filled; it never entered the &s;hal|low trough which is placed level with the &s;urface of the ground, but to eat the bread which I threw to it: when it had eaten and drank it remained motionle&s;s; &s;ometimes it dived to the bottom, to gather the crumbs which fell down; if any bird came into the wa|ter and approached it, the Scoter endeavoured to drive away the intruder; if this made any oppo&s;ition or re&s;i&s;tance, it dived, and after making two or three turns at the bottom of the trough, it flew out of the water, making a &s;ort of whi&s;tling, very &s;oft and clear, like the fir&s;t tone of a German flute: this is the only cry I ever knew it make, which it repeated as&endq; often as a per&s;on approached it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Being de&s;irous to know if the bird could continue long under water, I held it down by force; it made con&s;iderable efforts after two or three minutes, and &s;eemed to &s;uffer much; it bounded up as quick as a cork. I believe it could remain longer, becau&s;e it de&s;cends often to the depth of thirty feet in the &s;ea to&endq; gather the oblong bivalves on which it feeds.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The&s;e &s;hell-fi&s;h are whiti&s;h, four or five lines broad, and near an inch long. It does not amu&s;e it&s;elf like the &s;ea-pie in opening them, the &s;hape of its bill not being, as in that bird, adapted for the purpo&s;e: it &s;wallows them whole, and dige&s;ts them in a few hours. I gave &s;ometimes more than twenty to a &s;ingle
<PB N="203" REF="229">
Scoter; and it received them till its <HI>oe&s;ophagus</HI> was filled up to the bill: then its excrements were white. They a&s;&s;umed a green tinge when the bird was fed with bread, but were always liquid. I never &s;aw it eat herbs or the &s;eeds of plants, like the wild ducks, the teals, the wigeons, and others of this genus: the &s;ea is its only element. It flies as ill as it walks: I have often amu&s;ed my&s;elf in viewing thro' a &s;py-gla&s;s the numerous flocks on the &s;ea; I never &s;aw them ri&s;e and fly to any di&s;tance; they fluttered ince&s;&s;antly above the &s;urface of&endq; the water.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The feathers of this bird are &s;o &s;mooth and clo&s;e, that the bird, on coming out of the wa|ter,&endq; can &s;hake it&s;elf dry.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The &s;ame cau&s;e which proved fatal to &s;o many other birds in my court, occa&s;ioned al&s;o the death of my Scoter. The &s;oft and tender &s;kin of its feet were perpetually brui&s;ed by the gravel; a <HI>callus</HI> formed on each joint of the toes; in time they were worn to &s;uch a de|gree, that the nerves were di&s;clo&s;ed; it dur&s;t no longer walk, or go to the water, each &s;tep increa&s;ing its wounds: I put it in my garden on the gra&s;s under a cage, but it would not eat; and it died in my court a few days after.&endq;</Q> <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Scoter or Black Diver, <HI>Anas Nigra:</HI> "Its body is entirely black."

large white &s;pot on the &s;mall coverts of the wing, and another of a round form on each &s;ide of the tail; the belly is black; the bill is red, and its upper mandible is parted in to two brims, which &s;well, and, to u&s;e the words of Edwards, nearly re&s;emble beans. It is the mo&s;t &s;ingular part, he adds, of the conformation of this bird, which exceeds the &s;ize of a dome&s;tic duck. Yet we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that <HI>the female collared duck from Newfoundland</HI> of our <HI>Planches Enlumin&eacute;es</HI> is much analogous to the gray-headed Duck of Edwards; the chief difference con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the tints of the back are blacker in the plate of that naturali&s;t, and that the cheek is painted greeni&s;h. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the King Duck, <HI>Anas Spectabilis:</HI> <Q>&startq;Its bill is compre&s;&s;ed at the ba&s;e; a black feathery keel; its head &s;omewhat hoary.&endq;</Q> This bird is very common in Greenland and affords the natives much down.</NOTE></P>

<P>This little Sarcelle breeds on our pools, and continues in the country the whole year. It conceals its ne&s;t among the large bulru&s;hes, and builds it with their &s;talks, their pith, and with a heap of feathers: this ne&s;t, con&s;tructed with much care, is pretty wide, and re&s;ts on the &s;ur|face of the water, &s;o as to ri&s;e and fall with it. The eggs amount to ten or twelve, and are about the &s;ize of a pigeon's; they are dirty white, with hazel-&s;pots. The females take the whole ma|nagement of the incubation; the males &s;eem to leave them and a&s;&s;ociate together during that time, but in autumn they return to their fami|lies. The teals are &s;een on the pools in clu&s;ters of ten or twelve; and in winter they re&s;ort to the rivers and unfrozen &s;prings; there they live on cre&s;&s;es and wild chervil.

<PB N="226" REF="254">
Sarcelle of the preceding article, and not the Summer Teal de&s;cribed by Ray; but we cannot forbear in&s;erting his ob&s;ervations, which are im|portant.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;We here (at <HI>Montreuil-&s;ur-mer)</HI> call the Summer Sarcelle <HI>criquard</HI> or <HI>criquet;</HI> this bird is well made, and has much grace; its form is rounder than that of the com|mon &s;arcelle or garganey; it is al&s;o more decorated, its colours are more varied and better contra&s;ted; it has &s;ometimes little blue feathers, which are not &s;een but when the wings are opened. Few water-birds are &s;o chearful and &s;prightly as this Sarcelle; it is almo&s;t continually in motion, and bathes in|ce&s;&s;antly: it is very ea&s;ily tamed; I kept &s;ome &s;everal years in my court, and I &s;till&endq; have two which are very familiar.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The&s;e hand&s;ome Sarcelles join to all their qualities an extreme gentlene&s;s. I never &s;aw them fight either among them&s;elves or with other birds: they make no defence even when attacked. As delicate as they are gentle, the lea&s;t accident hurts them; the agitation into which they are thrown if cha&s;ed by a dog, is &s;ufficient to occa&s;ion their death: when they cannot e&s;cape by the aid of their wings, they remain extended on the &s;pot, exhau&s;ted and expiring. Their food is bread, barley, wheat, and bran: they al&s;o catch flies, earth-worms,&endq; &s;lugs, and in&s;ects.</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="227" REF="255">
&startq;They arrive on our mar&s;hes that lie near the coa&s;t, about the fir&s;t days of March: I believe that the &s;outh wind brings them. They do not keep in flocks, like the other Sarcelles and the whi&s;tlers. They are &s;een roving on all &s;ides, and they pair &s;oon after their arrival. In April they &s;eek, in &s;limy &s;pots &s;carce ac|ce&s;&s;ible, large tufts of ru&s;hes, or herbs, very clo&s;e, and &s;omewhat rai&s;ed above the level of the mar&s;h. They obtain a lodgment by re|moving the &s;talks that encumber them, and by continual treading they form a little cavity, four or five inches in diameter, of which they line the bottom with dry herbs: the top is well covered by the thickne&s;s of ru&s;hes, and the entrance is hid by the &s;talks which were laid there; this entrance, for the mo&s;t part, faces the &s;outh. The female depo&s;its from ten to fourteen eggs of a white &s;omewhat tar|ni&s;hed, and almo&s;t as large as pullets' eggs. I di&s;covered that the time of incubation is, as in&endq; hens, from twenty-one to twenty-three days.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The young are hatched covered with down, like the ducklings: they are very alert, and, a few days after birth, they are conducted by their parents to the water. They &s;eek worms under the gra&s;s and in the mud. If any rave|nous bird chance to pa&s;s, the mother makes a &s;aint cry, and the whole family &s;quats, and re|mains motionle&s;s till another cry recalls them&endq; to their activity.</Q></P>
<P><Q><PB N="228" REF="256">
&startq;Their fir&s;t feathers are gray, like tho&s;e of the females. It is then very difficult to di&s;|tingui&s;h the fexes, nor is the difficulty remov|ed till the love-&s;ea&s;on; for it is a fact peculiar to this bird, which I have frequently had an opportunity of verifying, and which I &s;hall here relate:&mdash;I commonly procured the&s;e Sar|celles about the beginning of March; at that time the males were arrayed in their mo&s;t beautiful feathers; the &s;ea&s;on of moulting ar|rived, they became as gray as the females, and continued in that &s;tate till the month of Ja|nuary; in the &s;pace of a month their feathers a&s;&s;umed another tinge. The pre&s;ent year I have again admired this change; the male which I have now is as beautiful as it can be, and I &s;aw it as gray as the female. It would &s;eem that nature has attired it for the &s;ea&s;on&endq; of love.</Q></P>

<P>THIS Sarcelle is nearly as large as the gar|ganey; but its bill is rather larger and broader: its head, neck, and brea&s;t, are of a rufous brown, glowing and inten&s;e; all its man|tle is black; there is a &s;treak of white on the wing; the &s;tomach is white, and the belly is of the &s;ame rufous brown with the brea&s;t.</P>

<P>THIS &s;pecies of Sarcelle, which is a native of Guiana, is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the others by the tail-feathers, which are longer, and terminated by a little &s;tiff filament like a &s;pine, formed by the point of the &s;haft, produced a line or two beyond the webs of the&s;e feathers, which are blacki&s;h brown.

<HEAD>SPECIES WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE DUCKS AND SARCELLES.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the de&s;cription and hi&s;tory of the &s;pecies well known and di&s;criminated, it remains to indicate tho&s;e to which the following accounts &s;eem to refer; in order that ob&s;ervers and travellers may di&s;cover to what preceding &s;pecies each belongs; or, if different, to delineate the new &s;pecies.</P>
<P N="1">I. We mu&s;t mention the ducks commonly called <HI>four wings,</HI> of which the Collection of the Academy &s;peaks in the&s;e terms. <Q>&startq;About 1680, appeared in the Boulonois a kind of ducks, which had their wings turned differently from others, the great feathers parting from the body and projecting out: which has occa&s;ioned the people to &s;ay, and believe, that they have four wings.&endq;</Q> <HI>(Collect. Acad. Part. Etr. tom.</HI> i. <HI>p.</HI> 304). We conceive that this character might be accidental, from the bare compari&s;on of the preceding pa&s;&s;age with the following. <Q>&startq;M. l'Abb&eacute; Nollet &s;aw in Italy a flock of gee&s;e, among which were many that &s;eemed to have four wings: but this appearance, which took place only when the bird flew, was cau&s;ed by the inver&s;ion of the la&s;t portion of the wing, which kept the great feathers elevated in&s;tead of lying flat along the body. The&s;e ducks
<PB N="245" REF="274">
came from the &s;ame hatch with the re&s;t which carried their wings as u&s;ual; and neither of their parents had its pinions folded back.&endq;</Q> <HI>Hi&s;toire de l' Academie,</HI> 1750, <HI>p.</HI> 7.</P>
<P>Thus the&s;e ducks, like the four-winged gee&s;e, mu&s;t not be con&s;idered as peculiar &s;pecies, but as accidental and even individual varieties, which may occur in any kind of birds.</P>
<P N="2">II. The duck, or rather the very little teal, mentioned by Rzaczyn&s;ki in the following pa&s;|&s;age: <HI>Lithuania Pole&s;ia alit anates innumeras, inter quas...&s;unt...in cavis arborum natae, molem &s;turni non excedentes (Hi&s;t. p.</HI> 269.) [Poli&s;h Li|thuania maintains ducks innumerable, among which...are...that breed in the hollows of trees, and exceed not the bulk of a &s;tare.] If this au|thor is accurate with regard to the &s;ize, which he makes to be &s;o diminutive, we mu&s;t confe&s;s that the &s;pecies is unknown to us.</P>
<P N="3">III. The white-headed Barbary duck of Dr. Shaw, which is not the &s;ame with the mu&s;k duck, but ought rather to be cla&s;&s;ed with the Sarcelles, &s;ince it is only, he &s;ays, of the <HI>&s;ize of the lapwing:</HI> it has a broad, thick, blue bill; its head entirely white, and its body flame-co|loured.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The <HI>anas platyrinchos</HI> of the &s;ame author, who calls it the <HI>Barbary pelican,</HI> improperly, &s;ince nothing can be further from a pelican than a duck. This is &s;maller than the preceding: its legs are red; its bill flat, broad, black, and indented; its
<PB N="246" REF="275">
brea&s;t, belly, and head are flame-coloured; its back is of a deeper ca&s;t; and there are &s;pots on the wing, a blue, a white, and a green.</P>
<P N="5">V. The &s;pecies which this traveller, with equal inaccuracy, denominates <HI>the little-billed Barbary pelican.</HI> <Q>"It is," &s;ays he, &startq;&s;omewhat larger than the preceding; its neck is reddi&s;h, and its head is adorned with a little tuft of tawny feathers; its bill is entirely white, and its back variegated with a number of white and black &s;tripes; the feathers of the tail are pointed, and the wings are each marked with two contiguous &s;pots, the one black and the other white; the extremity of the bill is black, and the legs are of a deeper blue than tho&s;e of the lapwing.&endq;</Q> This &s;pecies appears to us much a-kin to the foregoing.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The <HI>turpan,</HI> or <HI>tourpan,</HI> a Siberian duck, found by Gmelin in the vicinity of Selingin&s;ki, of which he has given an account too &s;hort for recognizing the bird <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>&startq;In the neighbourhood of Selingin&s;k, we found a &s;mall lake, who&s;e &s;ides were covered with &s;wans, <HI>gee&s;e,</HI> tourpans, and &s;nipes: I cannot expre&s;s the &s;atisfaction which the &s;ight of the&s;e birds be|gat; their &s;ong, in&s;pired by nature, was as plea&s;ing as the imita|tion with in&s;truments would be di&s;agreeable. The tones of the tourpans re&s;emble much tho&s;e of an hautbois; and, in this concert of birds, they performed nearly the part of the ba&s;s. This bird is a kind of duck; its plumage is fox-red, except the tail and the wings, which have a great mixture of black.&endq;</Q> <HI>Gmelin.</HI></P></NOTE>.

<HEAD>The PETRELS.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>Procellariae</HI> of Linnaeus.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OF all the marine birds, tho&s;e which the mo&s;t con&s;tantly live on the great &s;eas, are the Petrels; the mo&s;t &s;trangers to the land, the mo&s;t adventurous in roving on the va&s;t ocean: they commit them&s;elves with equal confidence and audacity to the rolling billows, the impetuous winds, and &s;eem to brave the fury of the tem|pe&s;ts. In the remote&s;t portions of the globe, in every zone which navigators have vi&s;ited, the&s;e birds &s;eemed to expect their arrival, and even to have &s;tretched beyond them into more di&s;tant and more &s;tormy latitudes. Every where they have been &s;een to &s;port with &s;ecurity, and even gaiety, on that element, &s;o terrible in its fury, which unnerves the mo&s;t intrepid man: as if nature meant to demon&s;trate, that the in&s;tincts and faculties which &s;he has allotted to the inferior creatures, excel the combined powers of our rea|&s;on and our art.</P>
<P>Furni&s;hed with long wings, accommodated with palmated feet, the Petrels add to the ea&s;e and nimblene&s;s of flying, and to the facility of
<PB N="253" REF="282">
&s;wimming, the &s;ingular power of running and walking on the water, razing the waves in a ra|pid pa&s;&s;age, their body being &s;upported horizon|tally, and balanced by the wings, and their feet &s;triking alternately and precipitately on the &s;ur|face. Hence is derived the Engli&s;h name <HI>Petrel,</HI> or <HI>Peterel,</HI> which alludes to St. Peter's walking on the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of the Petrels are numerous: they have all large and &s;trong wings; yet they ri&s;e not to a great height, and commonly they raze the water in their flight. They have three toes con|nected by a membrane; their two lateral toes have a ledge on their outer part; their fourth toe is only a little &s;pur that ri&s;es immediately from the heel, without joint or phalanx <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby calls this &s;pur, <HI>a little hind-roe,</HI> not imagining that it proceeds immediately from the heel.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The bill, like that of the albatro&s;s, is articu|lated, and &s;eems compo&s;ed of four pieces, two of which, as if they were added portions, form the extremities of the mandibles. There are al&s;o, along the upper mandible, near the head, two little tubes or flat rolls, in which the no&s;trils are perforated. From its general conformation, the bill would &s;eem to be that of a ravenous bird, for it is thick, &s;harp, and hooked at its extremity: but this figure of the bill is not ex|actly the &s;ame in all the Petrels, and the differ|ence is even &s;uch as to afford a character for the &s;ubdivi&s;ion of the genus. In fact, the point of the
<PB N="254" REF="283">
upper mandible alone is in many &s;pecies bent into a hook; the point of the lower, on the con|trary, is channelled and truncated like a &s;poon.&mdash;The&s;e &s;pecies are the &s;imple Petrels. In others, the points of both mandibles are &s;harp, reflected, and form together the hook. This difference of character has been remarked by Bri&s;&s;on; and we think that it ought not to be omitted or rejected, as done by For&s;ter.&mdash;We &s;hall denominate the&s;e &s;pecies <HI>puffin-petrels.</HI></P>

They inhabit the land only during that time, which is pretty &s;hort; and, as if they were &s;en&s;ible of the incongruity of that re&s;idence, they hide or rather bury them&s;elves in holes under the rocks by the &s;ea-&s;hore. From the bottom of the&s;e holes is heard their di&s;agree|able voice, which would generally be taken for the croaking of a reptile <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Petrels bury them&s;elves by thou&s;ands in holes under ground; there they rear their young, and lodge every night. <HI>For&s;ter's Ob&s;ervations.&mdash;</HI>The woods (at New Zealand) re&s;ound with the noi&s;e of the Petrels, concealed in holes under ground, which croak like frogs, or cluck like hens.

well aware: when attacked, they, whether from fear, or the hope of defending them&s;elves, di&s;|charge the oil with which their &s;tomach is filled; they &s;pout it in the face of the fowler; and as their ne&s;ts are u&s;ually lodged on rocky &s;hores, in the clifts of lofty precipices, igno|rance of this fact has co&s;t &s;ome ob&s;ervers their lives <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the General Adverti&s;er, for June 1761, is the following re|markable account from the I&s;le of Mull: <Q>&startq;A gentleman of the name of Campbell, being fowling among the rocks, and having mounted a ladder to take &s;ome birds out of their holes, was &s;o &s;urprized, by one of this &s;pecies &s;purting a quantity of oil in his face, that he quitted his hold, fell down, and peri&s;hed.&endq;</Q>&mdash;Smith, in his Hi&s;tory of Kerry, mentions the &s;ame property of the &s;tormy petrel.</NOTE>.</P>

The &s;ame author adds, that the&s;e birds invariably fol|low the boats employed in fi&s;hing for &s;ea-dogs, in expectation of the entrails that are thrown out. He &s;ays, that they fa&s;ten &s;o keenly on the dead whales, or &s;uch as are wounded and ri&s;en to the &s;urface, that the fi&s;hermen knock them down with &s;ticks, and yet cannot di&s;per&s;e the re&s;t of the flock.

<P>THE Blue Petrel, &s;o called becau&s;e its plumage is blue gray, as well as its bill and legs, occurs only in the South Seas, from the twenty|eighth to the thirtieth degree of latitude, and thence towards the pole.

<P>It is remarked as a peculiarity in the&s;e Blue Petrels, that their bill is exceeding broad, and their tongue very thick: they are &s;omewhat larger than the &s;nowy petrels <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Blue Petrel has nearly the &s;ize of a little pigeon. <HI>Cook.</HI></NOTE>. In the blue
<PB N="269" REF="300">
gray tint that covers the upper &s;ide of the body, we perceive a deeper band, cutting tran&s;ver&s;ely the wings and the lower part of the back: the end of the tail is al&s;o of the &s;ame deep blue or blacki&s;h ca&s;t: the belly and the under &s;ide of the wings are of a bluei&s;h-white. Their plu|mage is thick and abundant. <Q>&startq;The Blue Pe|trels, which are &s;een in this immen&s;e &s;ea,&endq;</Q> (between America and New Zealand) &s;ays Mr. For&s;ter, <Q>&startq;are no le&s;s provided again&s;t the cold than the penguins.

<P>The &s;ame ob&s;erver again found the&s;e Petrels in va&s;t numbers a&s;&s;embled to ne&s;tle in New Zealand. <Q>&startq;Some were flying, others were in the middle of the woods, under the roots of trees, in the crevices of rocks where they could not be caught, but where they undoubtedly hatch their young.

They lay two eggs, one of which, it is &s;aid, u&s;ually never hatches: but Willughby po&s;i|tively a&s;&s;erts, that they have only a &s;ingle egg. As &s;oon as the chick is hatched, the mother leaves it early in the morning, and returns not till evening. During the night &s;he feeds it, di&s;gorging at intervals the &s;ub&s;tance of the fi&s;h which &s;he caught in the cour&s;e of the day at &s;ea. The aliment, half dige&s;ted in her &s;tomach, turns into a &s;ort of oil, which &s;he gives to her young one. This nouri&s;hment makes it ex|tremely fat; and, at this time, &s;ome fowlers land on the rocky i&s;let, where they lodge in huts, and catch multitudes of the young birds in their burrows. But to render this game pa|latable, it mu&s;t be cured with &s;alt, in order to temper in part the rankne&s;s of its exce&s;&s;ive fat. Willughby, from whom we borrow the&s;e facts, adds, that as the fowlers have a cu&s;tom of cut|ting

away a foot from each of the&s;e birds, for the &s;ake of reckoning the number caught, the people entertain a notion that they are hatched with a &s;ingle foot.</P>
<P>Klein pretends, that the name <HI>Puffin</HI> or <HI>Pupin</HI> is formed from the cry of the bird. He re|marks, that this &s;pecies has its times of appear|ance and di&s;appearance; which mu&s;t indeed be the ca&s;e with birds that never come on land but to ne&s;tle, and that dwell on the &s;ea &s;ometimes in one latitude, &s;ometimes in another, always at|tending the &s;hoals of little migratory fi&s;h, or their collections of &s;pawn, on both which they feed.</P>
<P>Though the ob&s;ervations above related were all made in the northern &s;ea, it appears that this &s;pecies is not exclu&s;ively attached to that part of our globe. It is common on all &s;eas, for it is the &s;ame with the <HI>Jamaica &s;hear-water</HI> of Brown, and the <HI>artenna</HI> of Aldrovandus.

<P>THE bill is the principal organ of birds, the in&s;trument by which their powers and fa|culties are exerci&s;ed; it &s;erves as a mouth, as a hand, as an arm.

A &s;harp, lacerating hook arms the head of the fierce birds of prey; their appetite for fle&s;h and their thir&s;t for blood, joined to the

means of &s;atisfying the&s;e, precipitate them from their towering heights upon all other birds, and even upon all the weak and timorous animals, which are equally their victims. A bill &s;haped like a broad and flat &s;poon, induces another genus of birds to gather their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence at the bot|tom of the water: while a conical bill, &s;hort and truncated, enables the gallinaceous kind to pick up the &s;eeds on the ground, di&s;po&s;es them to a&s;&s;emble round us, and &s;eems to invite them to receive their food from our hands. A bill, fa|&s;hioned like a &s;lender pliant probe, which length|ens out the face of the curlews, of the wood|cock, of the &s;nipe, and of mo&s;t other waders, con&s;trains them to inhabit mar&s;hy grounds, there to dig in the &s;oft mud and the wet &s;lime. The &s;harp taper form of the woodpecker's bill con|demns it to bore the bark of trees. And finally, the little awl-&s;haped bill of mo&s;t of the field-birds permits them only to catch gnats and other mi|nute in&s;ects, and forbids every other &s;ort of food. Thus the different form of the bill mo|difies the in&s;tincts, and gives ri&s;e to mo&s;t of the habits of birds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is proper to put the reader on his guard again&s;t this &s;pe|cious &s;ort of declamation, in which the materiali&s;ts have &s;o much indulged.

<P><Q>&startq;The bill is longer than it is broad, if we mea&s;ure from its origin; its form is almo&s;t triangular, the two mandibles are move|able; the iron-gray, which partly paints it, is &s;eparated as it were by a white &s;emi-circle from a bright red that covers the point, and completes the decoration: the upper mandible pre|&s;ents four &s;treaks, the lower three, which corre&s;pond to the three la&s;t of the upper; all the&s;e &s;treaks form a &s;ort of &s;emi-circles: the upper mandible has at its ba&s;e a little roll, on which there are &s;mall holes di&s;po&s;ed regularly; from &s;ome of the&s;e holes very &s;mall feathers grow; the no&s;trils are placed on the edges of the upper mandible, and extend three lines in the length of the bill: I perceived on the palate of the bird &s;everal rows of fle&s;hly points directed towards the opening of the throat, of which the tran&s;pa|rent and glo&s;&s;y extremity &s;eemed to be &s;omewhat harder than the re&s;t; the eyes, edged with vermillion, have this peculiarity, that they occupy the centre of a gray triangular excre&s;cence: the legs are &s;hort, and of a bright orange like the feet; the nails are black and &s;hining, that of the hind toe is the longe&s;t and broade&s;t.&endq;</Q><HI>Ex|tract of a letter from M.

<HEAD>The PENGUINS and the MAN|CHOTS; <HI>or,</HI> The BIRDS WITHOUT WINGS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is difficult to &s;eparate in imagination the idea of bird from that of wings: yet is the faculty of flying not e&s;&s;ential to the feathered race. Some quadrupeds are provided with wings, and &s;ome birds are de&s;titute of them. A wing|le&s;s bird would &s;eem a mon&s;ter produced by the neglect or over&s;ight of nature; but what is ap|parently a derangement, an interruption of her plan, does really fill up the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and connects the chain of exi&s;tence. As &s;he has deprived the quadruped of feet, &s;he has al&s;o de|prived the bird of wings; and it is remarkable that the &s;ame defect begins with the land birds, and ends in the water fowl. The o&s;trich may be &s;aid to have no wings, the ca&s;&s;owary is ab&s;o|lutely de&s;titute of them; it is covered with hair in&s;tead of feathers. The&s;e two great birds &s;eem in many re&s;pects to approach the land animals; while the Penguins and Manchots appear to form the &s;hade between birds and fi&s;h. In&s;tead of wings they have little pinions, which might be &s;aid to be covered with &s;cales rather than fea|thers,
<PB N="315" REF="351">
and which &s;erve as fins <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They &s;eem to form a middle &s;pecies between the birds and the fi&s;hes; for the feathers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of their wings, differ little from &s;cales, and the&s;e wings, or rather pinions, mu&s;t be re|garded as fins. <HI>Cook.&mdash;</HI>The wings of the&s;e animals are without fea|thers, and &s;erve only as fins; they live mo&s;t of their time in the water. <HI>De Gennes.&mdash;</HI>The&s;e &s;tumps &s;erve as fins when they are in the water. <HI>Dampier.</HI></NOTE>; their body is large, compact, and cylindrical, behind which are attached two broad oars, rather than two legs: the impo&s;&s;ibility of advancing far into the land, the fatigue even of remaining there, other|wi&s;e than by lying; the nece&s;&s;ity, the habit of being almo&s;t always at &s;ea, their whole oeco|nomy of life, mark the analogy between the aquatic animals and the&s;e &s;hapele&s;s birds, &s;tran|gers to the regions of air, and almo&s;t equally exiled from tho&s;e of the land.</P>
<P>Thus between each of the great families, be|tween the quadrupeds, the birds, and the fi&s;hes, nature has placed connecting links that bind together the whole: &s;he has &s;ent forth the bat to flutter among the birds, while &s;he has impri|&s;oned the armadillo in a cru&s;taceous &s;hell. She has moulded the whale-kind after the quadru|ped, who&s;e form &s;he has only truncated in the walrus: the &s;eal, from the land, the place of his birth, plunges into the flood, and joins the ceta|ceous herd, to demon&s;trate the univer&s;al con&s;an|guinity of all the generations that &s;pring from the bo&s;om of the common mother: finally, &s;he
<PB N="316" REF="352">
has produced birds partaking of the in&s;tincts and oeconomy of fi&s;hes. Such are the two fa|milies of Penguins and Manchots, which ought however to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, as they are actually in nature, not only by conformation, but by dif|ference of climates.</P>
<P>The name of Penguin has been given indi&s;|criminately to all the &s;pecies of the&s;e two fami|lies, which has introduced confu&s;ion. We may &s;ee in Ray's Synop&s;is what difficulties ornitho|logi&s;ts have met with to accommodate the cha|racters a&s;cribed by Clu&s;ius to his Magellanic Penguins, with the characters ob&s;erved in the arctic Penguins. Edwards is the fir&s;t who re|conciled the&s;e contradictions: he ju&s;tly remarks, that far from thinking, with Willughby, that the northern Penguin was the &s;ame &s;pecies as the &s;outhern, one &s;hould rather be di&s;po&s;ed to range them in two different cla&s;&s;es; the latter having four toes, and the former having the traces only of the hind toe, and <HI>having its wings covered with nothing that can be called feathers;</HI> whereas the northern Penguin has very &s;mall wings, covered with real feathers.</P>
<P>To the&s;e differences we &s;hall add another, &s;till more e&s;&s;ential, that, in the &s;pecies of the north, the bill is furrowed with channels on the &s;ides, and rai&s;ed with a vertical blade; while, in tho&s;e of the &s;outh, it is cylindrical and pointed. Thus all the <HI>Penguins</HI> of the &s;outhern voyages
<PB N="317" REF="353">
are <HI>Manchots</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Manchot,</HI> in French, &s;ignifies <HI>maimed.</HI> I have, for the &s;ake of per&s;picuity, adopted the term.<HI>&mdash;T.</HI></NOTE>, which are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the real arctic <HI>Penguins,</HI> by e&s;&s;ential differences in the &s;tructure, as well as by the di&s;tance of the climates.</P>
<P>We proceed to prove this po&s;ition by a com|pari&s;on of the relations of voyagers, and by an examination of the pa&s;&s;ages in which our Man|chots are mentioned under the name of <HI>Penguins.</HI> All the navigators of the South Sea, from Nar|borough to Admiral An&s;on, Commodore Byron, M. de Bougainville, Me&s;&s;ieurs Cook and For&s;ter, agree in a&s;cribing to the&s;e Manchots the &s;ame characters, and all different from tho&s;e of the arctic Penguins <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The mo&s;t &s;ingular birds that are &s;een on the coa&s;t of Patago|nia have, in&s;tead of wings, two &s;tumps, which can be of no &s;ervice but in &s;wimming; their bill is <HI>&s;traight</HI> like that of an <HI>albatro&s;s</HI> (which points out the elongated cylindrical form). <HI>An&s;on.&mdash;</HI>The Penguin, in&s;tead of wings, has two flat &s;tumps, like the fins of fi&s;h; and its plumage is only a kind of &s;hort down...its neck is thick, its head and bill <HI>like that of a crow,</HI> except that the point turns a little downwards. <HI>Narborough.&mdash;</HI>In this country (Lobos-del-mar, in the Pacific Ocean) there are many birds, &s;uch as <HI>boobies,</HI> but e&s;pecially Penguins, of which I have &s;een prodigious numbers in all the South Seas, on the coa&s;t of the country lately di&s;covered, and at the Cape of Good Hope.

<P><Q>"The genus of the <HI>Penguins</HI> (Manchots)" &s;ays For&s;ter, &startq;have been improperly confounded with that of the <HI>diomedea</HI> (albatro&s;s) and that of the <HI>pha&euml;ton</HI> (tropic bird). Though the
<PB N="318" REF="354">
thickne&s;s of the bill varies, it has the &s;ame character in all (cylindrical and pointed); ex|cept that in &s;ome &s;pecies the end of the lower mandible is truncated: their no&s;trils are always linear &s;lits, which again proves them to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>albatro&s;&s;es:</HI> they all have exactly the &s;ame form of feet (three toes before, without any trace of a hind toe): the &s;tumps of the wings are &s;pread into fins by a membrane, and covered with plumules laid &s;o near each other as to re&s;emble &s;cales; this character, as well as the &s;hape of their bill and feet, di&s;criminates them from the <HI>alcae</HI> (the auks or true penguins) which are unable to fly, not becau&s;e their wings ab&s;olutely want feathers, but becau&s;e the&s;e feathers are too &s;hort.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>It is the Manchot, therefore, that we may par|ticularly &s;tile the <HI>wingle&s;s bird;</HI> and at fir&s;t &s;ight we might al&s;o call it the <HI>featherle&s;s bird.</HI> In fact, not only the hanging pinions &s;eem covered with &s;cales, but all the body is inve&s;ted with a compre&s;&s;ed down, exhibiting all the appearance of a thick, &s;haved beard, &s;prouting in &s;hort pen|cils of little glo&s;&s;y tubes, and which form a coat of mail impenetrable by water.</P>
<P>Yet, on a clo&s;e in&s;pection, we perceive in the&s;e <HI>plumules,</HI> and even in the &s;cales of the pinions, the &s;tructure of a feather, that is, a &s;haft and webs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards.</NOTE>. Wherefore Feuill&eacute;e has rea&s;on to find

<P>On the contrary, the northern Penguin is clothed with real feathers, &s;hort indeed, e&s;pe|cially on the wings, but which pre&s;ent unequi|vocally the appearance of feathers, and not that of hair, or down, or &s;cales.</P>
<P>Here then is a di&s;tinction well e&s;tabli&s;hed, and founded on e&s;&s;ential differences in the exterior conformation of the bill, and in the plumage.

<P>OF all the characters which might be em|ployed to denominate this &s;econd &s;pecies of Manchot, we have pitched on the &s;ize as the mo&s;t con&s;tant and di&s;criminating. It is what Edwards calls <HI>the black-footed penguin;</HI> but the feet of the great Manchot are black likewi&s;e. It appears in the <HI>Planches Enlumin&eacute;es</HI> under the name of <HI>the Manchot of the Cape of Good Hope,</HI> or of <HI>the Hottentots.</HI> But the &s;pecies occurs in other places be&s;ide the Cape, and is met with al&s;o on the South Seas. We had thought of calling it <HI>the collared Manchot;</HI> and in fact the black mantle of the back encircles the fore part
<PB N="342" REF="381">
of the neck by a collar, and &s;ends off upon the &s;ides two long bands after the manner of a &s;ca|pulary: but this livery appears not to be con|&s;tant except in the male, and the female has &s;carce &s;ome ob&s;cure trace of a collar. In both, the bill is coloured near the tip by a little yellow band, which perhaps depends on the age. So that we can denominate it only from its &s;ize, which is about the average in this genus, &s;eldom ever exceeding a foot and an half.</P>
<P>All the upper &s;urface of the body is &s;laty, that is of a blacki&s;h a&s;h-colour; and the fore part, with the &s;ides of the body, are of a fine white, except the collar and the &s;capulary; the end of the lower mandible &s;eems a little truncated, and the fourth toe, though free and not attached to the membrane, is turned more before than be|hind; the pinion is all flat, and looks as if co|vered with a &s;hagreen, the pencils of feathers which clothe it are &s;o little, &s;tiff, and pre&s;&s;ed, the large&s;t of the&s;e plumules is not half an inch long, and according to Edwards' remark, above an hundred may be counted in the fir&s;t row of the wing.</P>

the following note: <Q>&startq;The penguins (Manchots) of the Cape are black and white, and of the bulk of a duck; their eggs are white, two at each hatch, and they defend their brood cou|rageou&s;ly: they ne&s;tle on the i&s;lets along the coa&s;t; and an ob&s;erver of credit a&s;&s;ured me, that in one of the&s;e was a rai&s;ed knoll, which the&s;e birds preferred, though more than half a league from the &s;ea. As they walk &s;lowly, he thinks it impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould every day re&s;ort to the &s;ea for food.

<P>M. de Pages, in the manu&s;cript relation of his voyage towards the South Pole, agrees with re&s;pect to the&s;e facts. <Q>&startq;The &s;ize of the Cape Manchots," &s;ays he, "is equal to that of our large&s;t ducks: they have two oblong cravats of a black colour, the one on the &s;tomach, the other on the neck. We found commonly in the ne&s;t two eggs or two young ones, laid head to tail, the one always a fourth at lea&s;t bigger than the other.

only &s;lowly, and &s;ought to lie among the rocks.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>This voyager adds a curious fact, that the Manchots u&s;e their pinions from time to time as fore-feet, and then they go fa&s;ter, walking as it were on four. But in all probability this is a &s;ort of tumbling, and not a real walk.</P>

<HEAD>OF SYSTEMS IN ORNITHOLOGY.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t valuable work tran&s;mitted from the ancients on the &s;ubject of Ornitho|logy, is contained in Ari&s;totle's Hi&s;tory of Ani|mals. That great and univer&s;al genius, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the liberality of his pupil Alexander the Great, conducted the va&s;t undertaking with ad|mirable &s;ucce&s;s. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the rare faculty of acute perception; and the happy flexibility of the Greek language enabled him to mark with preci&s;ion the di&s;tingui&s;hing features of animals. Yet that philo&s;opher affects a dry and conci&s;e &s;tile, that frequently borders on ob|&s;curity; nor is he always at &s;ufficient pains to di&s;cu&s;s and reject popular notions. The natural Hi&s;tory of Pliny is a compilation which oftener di&s;plays the ta&s;te and elegance of its author than his critical di&s;cernment. He&s;iod, Aelian, Co|lumella, Aulus Gellius, and other writers, have left us &s;ome hints re&s;pecting the oeconomy of animals. The Chri&s;tian fathers indulged much in turgid figurative language, and occa&s;ionally
<PB N="378" REF="416">
drew their compari&s;ons from the current opi|nions in natural hi&s;tory. But the &s;un of &s;ci|ence was now &s;et, and that di&s;mal night &s;uc|ceeded, which over&s;pread the nations of Eu|rope. After the lap&s;e of twelve centuries, a ray of light bur&s;t in upon the Chri&s;tian world; and men of the greate&s;t abilities laboured with enthu&s;ia&s;m to re&s;tore the noble remains of anti|quity. The commentators on the treati&s;es of natural hi&s;tory were not in general &s;o well qualified for acquitting them&s;elves with credit: yet in that line of critici&s;m, Turner, and the ce|lebrated Jo&s;eph Scaliger, de&s;erve applau&s;e. At this period, America had been di&s;covered and explored, &s;ettlements formed along the coa&s;t of Africa, and an exten&s;ive intercour&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed with India. From the&s;e countries were im|ported birds of &s;ingular forms and wonderful beauty, which, while they increa&s;ed the &s;ubjects of Ornithology, incited powerfully to the &s;tudy of it. Prompted by a love of &s;cience, the learn|ed and &s;agacious Belon travelled into Greece, and Egypt, and A&s;ia Minor. Upon his return to France, he publi&s;hed his ob&s;ervations; but his Hi&s;tory of Birds was not given to the world till the year after his death, in 1555. Ge&s;ner com|po&s;ed, in 1557, a Treati&s;e on the Birds found in Switzerland. Various other productions ap|peared; and from all the&s;e &s;ources, Aldrovandus, with indu&s;try and erudition, but with little ta&s;te or judgment, compiled his voluminous Hi&s;tory
<PB N="379" REF="417">
of Birds, in 1599. Marcgrave's account of the birds di&s;covered in Brazil, was publi&s;hed 1648. Mr. Ray, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friend, Francis Willugh by, E&s;quire, wrote a Sy&s;tem of Ornithology in 1667, though it was not printed till 1678; a work of con&s;iderable merit. Bar|rere publi&s;hed his Sy&s;tem in 1745; Klein, in 1750; Moehring, in 1753; and Bri&s;&s;on, in 1760. Linnaeus attempted a cla&s;&s;ification of birds in his <HI>Fauna Suecica,</HI> in 1746, which he improved in his <HI>Sy&s;tema Naturae,</HI> in 1758; but it has been greatly altered and enlarged in the &s;ub&s;equent editions. One of the neate&s;t &s;y&s;tems of Ornithology was compo&s;ed in our own lan|guage, by the ingenious Thomas Pennant, E&s;|quire, in 1772, and publi&s;hed in 1781.
