<P>THE PRINCIPAL and PROFES|SORS
of the MARISCHAL COL|LEGE
of ABERDEEN, having lately
made a very material alteration in the or|der
of teaching Philo&s;ophy, they think it
incumbent upon them to lay before the
public, which is intere&s;ted in every thing
that relates to education, the rea&s;ons which
determined them to deviate from the hi|therto
received method.</P>
<P>THE order formerly ob&s;erved in this
College, was that followed by mo&s;t of the
antient Philo&s;ophers, which was afterwards
e&s;pou&s;ed by the Schola&s;tics, and generally
adopted by all the Univer&s;ities in Europe:
they began with Logic, then proceeded to
Ontology, Pneumatic, Morals, Politics;
and, la&s;t of all, taught Natural Philo&s;ophy.
The Peripatetic Philo&s;ophy, at lea&s;t as far
as it was e&s;pou&s;ed by the commentators
and followers of Ari&s;totle, was in great
<PB N="4" REF="4">
mea&s;ure made up of verbal &s;ubtleties, and
theories ill grounded, tho' ingeniou&s;ly de|vi&s;ed.
The&s;e were &s;upported by arguments
moulded into an artificial form; the me|chani&s;m
of which mu&s;t fir&s;t of all be under|&s;tood;
and it was laid open by the Logic
then in u&s;e. The chief bu&s;ine&s;s of that
Philo&s;ophy, was, to expre&s;s opinions in
hard and unintelligible terms; the &s;tudent
needed a dictionary or nomenclature of the
technical words and authori&s;ed di&s;tinctions;
experiment was quite neglected, &s;cience
was to be rea&s;oned out from general prin|ciples,
either taken for granted, or deduc|ed
by compari&s;on of general ideas, or
founded on very narrow and inadequate
ob&s;ervation: Ontology, which explained
the&s;e terms and di&s;tinctions, and laid down
the&s;e principles, was therefore introduced
immediately after Logic. By the&s;e two,
the &s;tudent was &s;ufficiently prepared for the
verbal, or at be&s;t, ideal inquiries of the o|ther
parts.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="5">
BUT Philo&s;ophy has been &s;ince that
time happily reformed, and is become an
image, not of human phanta&s;ies and con|ceits,
but of the reality of nature, and truth
of things. The only ba&s;is of Philo&s;ophy is
now acknowledged to be an accurate and
exten&s;ive hi&s;tory of nature, exhibiting an
exact view of the various phoenomena for
which Philo&s;ophy is to account, and on
which it is to found its rea&s;onings. This
being the reformed &s;tate of Philo&s;ophy,
great inconveniencies mu&s;t be found in
pro&s;ecuting the &s;chola&s;tic order of the &s;ci|ences.
The &s;tudent mu&s;t make a tran&s;iti|on
at once from words and languages to
Philo&s;ophy, without being previou&s;ly intro|duced
to the knowledge of facts, the &s;ole
foundation of, and preparation for it; he
mu&s;t be hurried, at the fir&s;t, into the mo&s;t
ab&s;tru&s;e, difficult and &s;ubtle parts of it; he
mu&s;t be put upon examining the nature,
foundation and different kinds of evidence
<PB N="6" REF="6">
and rea&s;oning, before he is acquainted with
any &s;pecimens of the&s;e kinds, by which
they may be illu&s;trated. And in proporti|on
as Philo&s;ophy is more improved, and
more thoroughly reformed, the&s;e inconve|niencies
mu&s;t become more &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE view of the&s;e induced the Ma&s;ters
of the Mari&s;chal College to think of alter|ing
the hitherto received order; and, after
the mo&s;t mature deliberation, made them
at la&s;t re&s;olve, that their &s;tudents &s;hould,
after being in&s;tructed in languages and
cla&s;&s;ical learning, be made acquainted with
the Elements of Hi&s;tory, Natural and Civil,
of Geography and Chronology, accompa|nied
with the Elements of Mathematics;
that they &s;hould then proceed to Natural
Philo&s;ophy, and, la&s;t of all, to Morals, Po|litics,
Logic and Metaphy&s;ics. And if, by
adopting this order, they avoid the incon|veniencies
above-mentioned, and make the
&s;ciences to follow one another, according
<PB N="7" REF="7">
to the natural connexion of their &s;ubjects,
and the gradual openings of the human
mind, may they not expect the approbati|on
of the public, and better fruits of their
labours, in forming the minds of youth, &s;o
as they may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more real know|ledge,
and that more u&s;eful for the various
purpo&s;es of human life? That this is the
ca&s;e, the following pages are intended to
evince.</P>
<P>THAT Logic &s;hould be taught fir&s;t, ap|pears
to be &s;upported by an argument, &s;pe|cious
enough on a tran&s;ient view, viz.
&ldquo;That as it profe&s;&s;es to teach the method
and rules of rea&s;oning, it is natural to
begin with learning the&s;e rules, and then
to apply them in the &s;everal &s;ciences.&rdquo;
But however plau&s;ible this argument may
at fir&s;t &s;ight &s;eem, it will, on clo&s;er atten|tion,
be found not at all &s;olid or conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>THE world is now pretty well &s;atisfied
<PB N="8" REF="8">
that the under&s;tanding cannot be aided in
the di&s;covery of truth, by a Logic like the
Schola&s;tic, founded on an arbitrary di&s;po&s;i|tion
of all things under certain general
names, and con&s;i&s;ting only of fine-&s;pun ob|&s;ervations
concerning the combination of
words in propo&s;itions, and of propo&s;itions
in artificial &s;yllogi&s;ms. This may a&s;&s;i&s;t one
in di&s;puting readily and artfully in defence
of either truth or error: but it can never
contribute to promote knowledge, and
guard us again&s;t mi&s;takes. The Logic
that can an&s;wer this end, mu&s;t accurately
examine and carefully a&s;certain the various
kinds of evidence, their foundations, their
laws, the &s;ubjects to which they belong,
the degree and &s;pecies of a&s;&s;ent which they
produce; it mu&s;t lay open the &s;ources of
error, the cau&s;es of fal&s;e judgment, and the
conduct of the under&s;tanding by which it
may be prevented; it mu&s;t explain the dif|ferent
methods of invention, at once &s;uited
to the con&s;titution of the mind, and to the
<PB N="9" REF="9">
varieties of the objects it is conver&s;ant with.</P>
<P>THIS is one of the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e and
difficult branches of Philo&s;ophy, and there|fore
quite improper to begin with. It has
a &s;trict dependence on many parts of know|ledge;
the&s;e mu&s;t of con&s;equence be pre|mi&s;ed,
before it can be rightly apprehend|ed.
The natural hi&s;tory of the human un|der&s;tanding
mu&s;t be known, and its phoe|nomena
di&s;covered; for without this, the
exertions of the intellectual faculties, and
their application to the various &s;ubjects of
&s;cience will be unintelligible. The&s;e phoe|nomena
mu&s;t be not only <HI>narrated,</HI> but
likewi&s;e, as far as po&s;&s;ible, <HI>explained;</HI> for
without inve&s;tigating their general laws,
no certain and general conclu&s;ions con|cerning
their exerci&s;e can be deduced.</P>
<P>NAY, all &s;ciences, all branches of know|ledge
whatever, mu&s;t be premi&s;ed as a
ground-work to genuine Logic. Hi&s;tory
<PB N="10" REF="10">
has one kind of evidence; Mathematics,
another; Natural Philo&s;ophy, one &s;till
different; the Philo&s;ophy of human nature,
another, di&s;tinct from all the&s;e: the &s;ub|ordinate
branches of the&s;e &s;everal parts,
have &s;till minuter peculiarities in the evi|dence
appropriated to them. An unpreju|diced
mind will in each of the&s;e be convin|ced
by that &s;pecies of argument which is
peculiar to it, tho' it does not reflect how
it comes to be convinced. By being con|ver&s;ant
in <HI>them,</HI> one is prepared for the &s;tu|dy
of <HI>Logic;</HI> for <HI>they</HI> &s;upply them with a
fund of materials; in <HI>them,</HI> the different
kinds of evidence and argument are exem|plified;
from <HI>them</HI> only, tho&s;e illu&s;trations
can be taken, without which, <HI>its</HI> rules and
precepts mu&s;t be unintelligible.</P>
<P>ALL ju&s;t conclu&s;ions, concerning the
works of nature, mu&s;t be founded on an in|duction
of particulars. And as in <HI>Natu|ral
Philo&s;ophy,</HI> the&s;e particulars are &s;upplied
<PB N="11" REF="11">
by ob&s;ervations and experiments on <HI>Natu|ral
Bodies,</HI> &s;o in <HI>Logic</HI> the particulars, of
which an induction mu&s;t be made, are to
be learned only from the body of <HI>Arts and
Sciences.</HI> The&s;e are the &s;ubjects on which
ob&s;ervations mu&s;t be made, in order to lay
down rules for inve&s;tigating and proving
the truths of which they are made up; ju&s;t
as the genuine performances of any art are
what mu&s;t be con&s;idered and ob&s;erved, in
laying down the rules of that art. No &s;o|lid
precept can be formed in Logic, except
by examining arts and &s;ciences, and attend|ing
to the method of rea&s;oning u&s;ed in
them, and to the evidence that accompa|nies
it. In proportion as they are cultivat|ed,
and no farther, Logic may be improv|ed.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Artem inveniendi cum invento adole&s;|cere &s;tatuat.</P>
<P>Verulam de interpret. naturae Aphori&s;m.</P></NOTE> And what is true of the invention of
Logic, is true likewi&s;e of the &s;tudy of it.
<PB N="12" REF="12">
It can be under&s;tood no farther than the &s;e|veral
&s;ciences, which it reviews and criti|ci&s;es,
are previou&s;ly under&s;tood. Accord|ingly
we find, that all the &s;y&s;tems of Logic
which have not been compiled from a care|ful
review and examination of the &s;everal
&s;ciences, con&s;i&s;t more of ingenious &s;ubtle|ties,
than of u&s;eful precepts a&s;&s;i&s;ting to the
mind in the various parts of knowledge.
And when Logic has been learned before
the other &s;ciences, the &s;ub&s;tantial parts of it
have been &s;carce attended to, or made any
u&s;e of, in the pro&s;ecution of <HI>them;</HI> nor &s;o
much as under&s;tood, but in as far as the
mind was gradually opened, and brought
to recollect them in its progre&s;s thro' the
&s;ciences. Let us illu&s;trate this by a parallel
ca&s;e.</P>
<P>LOGIC is preci&s;ely the &s;ame to <HI>Philo&s;o|phy,</HI>
that works of critici&s;m are to <HI>Poetry.</HI>
The rules of critici&s;m are formed by an ac|curate
&s;crutiny and examination of the be&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="13">
works of poetry. To one who had never
read a poem, the&s;e rules would be ob&s;cure
and u&s;ele&s;s; he could not comprehend
them, far le&s;s would he be able to form a
judgment of their ju&s;tne&s;s, and of the rea|&s;ons
on which they are founded. If one
peru&s;es the be&s;t poetical performances, he
will acquire &s;ome degree of ta&s;te, tho' he
has never profe&s;&s;edly &s;tudied the rules of
critici&s;m; and he will, at the &s;ame time,
lay in materials, and obtain a &s;tock of ex|amples,
which may render the&s;e rules in|telligible
to him, and enable him to judge
whether they are ju&s;t or not. And by af|terwards
&s;tudying the&s;e rules, he improves,
refines and corrects his ta&s;te, perceives the
principles on which he has founded all his
judgments, tho' he did not in the mean
time, think of them, and gains additional
&s;ecurity again&s;t his judging wrong. This
may illu&s;trate what has been &s;aid of the
place which Logic ought to hold among
the &s;ciences. The ob&s;ervations made in
<PB N="14" REF="14">
it, both concerning the methods of inven|tion,
and of probation, are founded on, and
deduced from, the &s;everal &s;ciences in which
the&s;e methods are u&s;ed. Neither the ob|&s;ervations
them&s;elves, nor the rea&s;ons on
which they are built, can be fully compre|hended
by one ab&s;olutely ignorant of the&s;e
&s;ciences. In &s;tudying the particular &s;cien|ces,
rea&s;on will &s;pontaneou&s;ly exert it&s;elf:
if the proper and natural method of rea&s;on|ing
is u&s;ed, the mind will by the native
force of its faculties perceive the evidence
and be convinced by it, tho' it does not re|flect
how this comes to pa&s;s, nor explicite|ly
con&s;ider according to what general rules
the under&s;tanding is exerted. By after|wards
&s;tudying the&s;e rules, one will be far|ther
fitted for pro&s;ecuting the &s;everal &s;ci|ences;
the knowledge of the grounds and
laws of evidence will give him the &s;ecurity
of <HI>reflection,</HI> again&s;t employing wrong me|thods
of proof and improper kinds of evi|dence,
additional to that of <HI>in&s;tinct</HI> and <HI>na|tural
<PB N="15" REF="15">
genius.</HI> And thus Logic will great$y
contribute to improvement in knowledge;
and more &s;o, when it is u&s;ed as a <HI>review</HI> of
the method taken in the pro&s;ecution of &s;ci|ence,
of the foundations gone upon, and of
the general rules that have been ob&s;erved,
than when it is applied as an <HI>introduction</HI>
to the elements of &s;cience: for in the for|mer
ca&s;e, its rules can be perfectly under|&s;tood,
&s;ufficiently illu&s;trated, and put in
practice as they are learned, which in the
latter is quite impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THERE is one objection that may &s;till
remain to what has been &s;aid, viz.
&startq;That the elements of the other &s;ciences
mu&s;t be taught with di&s;advantage, when
the &s;tudent is wholly unacquainted with
the rules of rea&s;oning ob&s;erved in them.&endq;
But we have &s;een that Logic can &s;carce be
taught at all till the&s;e elements are learned,
at lea&s;t not &s;o as to produce any con&s;ider|able
advantage in the &s;tudy of Philo&s;ophy;
<PB N="16" REF="16">
its rules being but ill under&s;tood, thro' ig|norance
of the examples by which they are
to be illu&s;trated, and of the particulars on
which they are founded, will be forgot be|fore
there is occa&s;ion to apply them, or, if
they are remembred, the &s;tudent having but
an indi&s;tinct conception of them, is incap|able
of applying them. Be&s;ides, there will
not be found &s;o great inconvenience as is
apprehended, in &s;tudying the elements of
&s;cience, without a previous knowledge of
the precepts of Logic. Man is naturally
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of rea&s;on and genius, and capable
of exerting it with tolerable ju&s;tne&s;s on a
variety of &s;ubjects, before he is formally in|&s;tructed
in the rules of rea&s;oning; of him|&s;elf,
he conforms to them, as it were by in|&s;tinct,
without reflecting or explicitely
knowing what they are. Lay before a
man of ordinary under&s;tanding a piece of
ju&s;t rea&s;oning in any of the &s;ciences, and
he &s;hall be convinced by it, tho' he never
heard of the artificial rules of rea&s;oning, or
<PB N="17" REF="17">
reflected on the nature and foundation of
the evidence that attends it. It is in fact
only by ob&s;erving the natural rea&s;onings of
mankind, that ju&s;t <HI>rules</HI> of rea&s;oning can be
di&s;covered, or an u&s;eful theory of evidence
e&s;tabli&s;hed. But if the natural force of
rea&s;on and genius is thought in&s;ufficient to
conduct the &s;tudent thro' the elements of
&s;cience, it is ea&s;y in teaching them, to make
&s;uch occa&s;ional ob&s;ervations on the evi|dence
u&s;ed, as will be of much greater be|nefit
than a &s;y&s;tem of Logic previou&s;ly
learned, or rather conned by rote. Thus if
one were in&s;tructing a pupil to read Poe|try
with &s;omething of ta&s;te, who were no$
as yet &s;ufficiently qualified for a formal
treati&s;e of Critici&s;m, he would in going thro'
&s;ome regular performance, point out its
beauties and faults, and make &s;cattered ob|&s;ervations
on the rules of compo&s;ition,
which would be of much greater &s;ervice
than if he had put into his hands a didac|tic
treati&s;e of precepts, before he had been
<PB N="18" REF="18">
&s;ufficiently prepared by a peru&s;al of the
works of Poets. We have already ob&s;erv|ed
that the &s;everal &s;ciences con&s;idered
with re&s;pect to their evidence form, as it
were, the <HI>&s;ylva,</HI> the natural hi&s;tory of the
human intellect and its operations on
which Logic is built: and as the natural
hi&s;tories on which the other &s;ciences are
founded, need not confine them&s;elves to
bare narration, but ought to inter&s;per&s;e oc|ca&s;ionally
general ob&s;ervations upon the
hi&s;tory, which will promote and prepare
for the philo&s;ophical interpretation of
them<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Super&s;unt additamenta quaedam hi&s;toriae naturalis utilia, quae eam magis commode in|flectere et aptare po&s;&s;int ad opus interpretis, quod &s;uccedit.&mdash;Non abs re fuerit ob&s;erva|ti$nes quandoque a&s;pergere.&mdash;E$iam cano|nes (qui nil aliud &s;unt quam ob&s;ervationes generales et catholicae) optime a&s;cribuntur. <HI>$erulam.

attending them, as will in a great
mea&s;ure make the learner &s;ee, as he pro|ceeds,
the foundations on which he rea&s;ons,
and the laws which he ob&s;erves, and will
at the &s;ame time prove an excellent prepa|ration
to the &s;tudy of Logic.</P>
<P>LET it be further ob&s;erved upon this
head, That, by the regulations now e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
in the Mari&s;chal College, all the &s;tu|dents
being obliged to apply them&s;elves to
the &s;tudy of Mathematics, how &s;oon they
enter upon the &s;econd year of their cour&s;e,
they are not only prepared by that &s;tudy,
for under&s;tanding natural Philo&s;ophy, or
the &s;cience of bodies; but are gradually,
and as it were nece&s;&s;arily, led both into an
habit of clo&s;e attention of mind, and like|wi&s;e
of ju&s;t and accurate rea&s;oning, by ha|ving
the mo&s;t perfect examples of ju&s;t rea|&s;oning
laid before them.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In Geometria partem fatentur e&s;&s;e uti|lem teneris aetatibus: agitari namque animos, atque acui ingenia, et celeritatem percipiendi venire inde concedunt.

<P><PB N="20" REF="20">
WHAT has been &s;aid will 'tis hoped a|bundantly
&s;how that genuine Logic may
with greater propriety and &s;ucce&s;s be
taught as a critical review of the &s;ciences,
than as an introduction to them, and that,
in&s;tead of being the fir&s;t, it ought natural|ly
to be the la&s;t.</P>
<P>IT will not however be improper far|ther
to take notice of the prejudice that
may ari&s;e again&s;t the place a&s;&s;igned to Lo|gic,
from the contrary practice of the
greate&s;t part of the ancient Philo&s;ophers.
This will appear to be of &s;mall weight, if
we con&s;ider what was the nature and de|&s;ign
of the Logic adopted by them. It is
well known that the ancient Greeks were
above all nations talkative, and fond of ex|temporary
di&s;putes on either &s;ide of any
<PB N="21" REF="21">
que&s;tion. Logic was introduced by Zeno
the di&s;ciple of Parmenides, as is believed,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Diog. Laert. praef.</NOTE>
as a help in managing readily and copiou&s;|ly
the&s;e di&s;putations, and not as a mean of
di&s;covering truth; accordingly it regarded
not things but words, and con&s;i&s;ted of a
collection of ob&s;ervations made on human
conver&s;ations, and reduced to general rules
the heads of argument and di&s;cour&s;e on a|ny
&s;ubject. When this was the nature, and
this the de&s;ign of Logic, it had no &s;uch de|pendence
on the other parts of &s;cience, as
to require a previous knowledge of them,
and came in naturally enough among the
arts of kin to it, which likewi&s;e regarded
language. That this is a ju&s;t account of
the ancient Logic, can &s;carce be di&s;puted.
It was &s;eldom applied by the be&s;t of the
ancients to the making of di&s;coveries in
the other &s;ciences; and when it was, it
only &s;erved to vitiate and fetter their in|ventions:
its chief u&s;e was to &s;erve as a
<PB N="22" REF="22">
foundation for rhetorical invention and &s;ub|tlety,
and in this view we find it is al|ways
con&s;idered by Cicero and the other
writers of in&s;titutions. Since then the Logic
commonly in u&s;e among the ancients re|garded
only words, but that now introduc|ed
(of which &s;ome of the ancients, e&s;peci|ally
SOCRATES and his di&s;ciples, gave
&s;ome hints, and which has &s;ince been
greatly cultivated by LORD VERULAM,
Mr. LOCKE, and others) regards things
and real knowledge, no argument can be
drawn from the place a&s;&s;igned to that, for
the place which ought to be a&s;&s;igned to
this. But whatever has been the opinion
of Philo&s;ophers, it can have very little
weight, in oppo&s;ition to rea&s;on, when men
are &s;olicitous, not about the philo&s;ophy of
this or that particular man, but about the
philo&s;ophy of nature. The place of Lo|gic
being once determined, it will be ea&s;y
to a&s;certain the order of the other &s;ciences,
natural Philo&s;ophy, Pneumatics, Ethics,
and Politics.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="23">
ETHICS, or moral Philo&s;ophy is founded
as well as Logic on Pneumatics, and mu&s;t
therefore come after it. The con&s;titution
of man, and his &s;everal active powers mu&s;t
be explained, before his bu&s;ine&s;s, his duty,
and his happine&s;s can be di&s;covered. Juri&s;|prudence
and Politics, taking a more com|plex
view of man than Morals, by con&s;ider|ing
his various &s;tates, as well as his nature
and powers, cannot with any propriety be in|troduced
till Morals have fir&s;t been &s;tudied.</P>
<P>IT only remains then to determine whe|ther
natural Philo&s;ophy or Pneumatology,
ought in the order of teaching to have the
preference. And many con&s;iderations &s;eem
to require that the former &s;hould be &s;tudi|ed
fir&s;t. If it were not, Pneumatology
&s;hould be too far disjoined from the practi|cal
&s;ciences founded on it, one of which,
Logic, ought, as we have &s;een, to be
taught la&s;t of all. Be&s;ides, we ought al|ways
<PB N="24" REF="24">
to begin with the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t
obvious &s;ubjects, and to proceed gradually
to the mo&s;t difficult; and in order to this
we ought to comply as much as po&s;&s;ible,
with the natural openings and progre&s;s of
the human mind. Now it is evident that
the mind receives fir&s;t of all impre&s;&s;ions
and ideas of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible things with
which it is &s;urrounded. It is not till after
it has exerci&s;ed its faculties about them
that it reflects on its own operations or ac|quires
perceptions of them. We are from
our earlie&s;t infancy accu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve
external things, tho' often tran&s;iently and
inattentively; they lie always in our view,
they force them&s;elves upon us, and we can|not
avoid regarding them more or le&s;s.
But we &s;eldom attend to the operations of
our minds in our earlier years; it is late
before we acquire di&s;tinct notions of them,
or can ea&s;ily and readily make them the
objects of our contemplation. Farther, ex|ternal
&s;en&s;ation, by which bodies are per|ceived,
<PB N="25" REF="25">
is a more palpable kind of evidence,
than internal, from which all our know|ledge
of &s;pirits is derived; it &s;trikes and
affects us more. The Philo&s;ophy of &s;pi|rits,
as well as that of bodies, is founded
&s;olely on experiments and ob&s;ervations;
but in the latter it is much ea&s;ier to make
the&s;e than in the former: we can put <HI>bo|dies</HI>
in any &s;ituation that we plea&s;e, and
ob&s;erve at lei&s;ure their effects on one ano|ther;
but the phoenomena of the <HI>mind</HI> are
of a le&s;s con&s;tant nature; we mu&s;t catch
them in an in&s;tant, and be content to glean
them up by ob&s;erving their effects, as they
accidentally di&s;cover them&s;elves in the &s;e|veral
circum&s;tances of life. The rea&s;on|ings
al&s;o by which conclu&s;ions are deduced
concerning mind are of a more ab&s;tru&s;e and
difficult nature than tho&s;e employed in the
&s;cience of bodies; the ideas about which
they are conver&s;ant are apter to be con|founded
with one another, and are with
greater difficulty kept di&s;tinct. On all
<PB N="26" REF="26">
the&s;e accounts, natural Philo&s;ophy mu&s;t be
to young minds ea&s;ier than Pneumatology,
and con&s;equently &s;hould be taught fir&s;t.</P>
<P>THERE remains one part of the &s;chola&s;|tic
Philo&s;ophy not yet taken notice of, viz.
that part of their Metaphy&s;ic which is term|ed
Ontology. The end it an&s;wered in their
&s;y&s;tem was mentioned already; and &s;ince
Philo&s;ophy has been &s;et upon another footing,
it is become le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than formerly.
Any real knowledge which it contains may
be delivered after all the other &s;ciences. Or
rather, in its place may be &s;ub&s;tituted a
more u&s;eful &s;cience,&mdash;including the Fir&s;t
Philo&s;ophy of Lord Verulam;&mdash;at the
&s;ame time tracing up the particular cau&s;es
of things, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to the mo&s;t ge|neral
and &s;imple principles, not by ab&s;tract
rea&s;onings, or the compari&s;on of general
ideas, but by a legitimate and careful in|duction;
and vindicating the con&s;titution
of nature by pointing out the final cau&s;es
<PB N="27" REF="27">
of the general laws to which beings are
&s;ubjected;&mdash;and likewi&s;e giving an ac|count
of the rea&s;onings of learned men on
various &s;ubjects con&s;idered in an ab&s;tract
view, and their opinions and enquiries con|cerning
que&s;tions of an ab&s;tru&s;e nature,
&s;uch as the exi&s;tence of matter, &s;pace, du|ration,
&amp;c.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations will, 'tis hoped, be
&s;ufficient to &s;how that the Ma&s;ters of the
Mari&s;chal College have con&s;ulted the na|tural
connexion of things, in altering the
u&s;ual order of teaching Philo&s;ophy. On
the&s;e principles it is, that they have now e|&s;tabli&s;hed
the following general Plan of E|ducation.</P>
<P>I. THE FIRST year is &s;pent as former|ly
in Cla&s;&s;ical Learning under the <HI>Profe&s;|&s;or
of Gre$k;</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is, not only
to teach that $legant language in which
the &s;ciences were fir&s;t delivered, and which,
<PB N="28" REF="28">
by retaining their original terms, and by
being u&s;ed by tho&s;e great ma&s;ters who&s;e
works are &s;till acknowledged &s;tandards in
them, mu&s;t always be regarded as the
foundation of knowledge, but to open the
minds of youth, by explaining antiquity,
by acquainting them with the lives and
characters of the chief cla&s;&s;ic authors, and
by pointing out the u&s;es of Literature, or
the various purpo&s;es it &s;erves in life.</P>
<P>II. IN the NEXT Cla&s;s, as much of the
&s;tudent's time as the Profe&s;&s;or thinks pro|per,
is &s;pent in reading the Greek and La|tin
cla&s;&s;ics, both that they may &s;till im|prove
in the&s;e languages, the great condu|its
thro' which ancient learning is commu|nicated
to us, and that by being conver&s;ant
with the be&s;t authors, they may early ac|quire
a ta&s;te for works of genius. 2. They
are to be in&s;tructed in <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> both <HI>Na|tural</HI>
and <HI>Civil,</HI> along with the Elements
of <HI>Geography</HI> and <HI>Chronology,</HI> on which Ci|vil
<PB N="29" REF="29">
Hi&s;tory depends. The &s;tudy of the&s;e is
judged to be a ju&s;t intermediate &s;tep between
the &s;tudy of languages and general rea&s;on|ings
concerning things. Hi&s;tory conveys
to a young mind in&s;tructions adapted to its
faculties, which at the &s;ame time open and
prepare it gradually for apprehending the
conclu&s;ions of Philo&s;ophy. Farther, on the
facts that Hi&s;tory, e&s;pecially natural, relates,
Philo&s;ophy, which is but a picture of the
real con&s;titutions and laws of things, mu&s;t
be entirely &s;ounded. In the pro&s;ecution of
it there mu&s;t be a perpetual intercour&s;e be|tween
the mind and nature. Philo&s;ophy
can never be further improved than in
proportion as Hi&s;tory is perfected; our
knowledge in the one and the other mu&s;t
keep pace, for Hi&s;tory relates the phoeno|mena,
and Philo&s;ophy explains and ac|counts
for them. The &s;tudy of Hi&s;tory,
particularly Natural Hi&s;tory, mu&s;t there|fore
be proper to precede that of Philo&s;o|phy,
not only as it opens the mind, but al|&s;o
<PB N="30" REF="30">
as it furni&s;hes it with the requi&s;ite ma|terials.
The&s;e are parts of knowledge,
entirely omitted in the former method of
univer&s;ity education, tho' of the greate&s;t u|tility
and moment in life. And it is, they
apprehend, a con&s;iderable advantage in
their new plan of teaching, that by it the&s;e
u&s;eful branches of &s;tudy are introduced in|to
the &s;cheme of Education. Natural hi&s;|tory,
be&s;ides its advantages already menti|oned,
is the immediate foundation of al|mo&s;t
all the arts of life, agriculture, garde|ning,
manufactures, medicines, &amp;c. The
profe&s;&s;or to who&s;e &s;hare it falls, does not
confine it to mere de&s;criptions of natural
bodies, their various cla&s;&s;es, characters,
principles and parts; but gives an account
al&s;o of the various u&s;es of the&s;e natural bo|dies,
and of the principles of the &s;everal
arts in life which depend upon, and are
employed about them. Nor is Civil Hi&s;to|ry
re&s;tricted to a narration of Epochs and
facts, tho' in that the foundation is laid,
<PB N="31" REF="31">
but it extends to an explication of the cau|&s;es
of the ri&s;e and fall of &s;tates, and of the
great revolutions that have happen'd in the
world, and to reflections on characters,
manners, cu&s;toms, &amp;c. which con&s;titutes
its u&s;efulne&s;s in general, and mu&s;t render
it peculiarly advantageous to young per|&s;ons,
by conveying moral in&s;truction by
example; by forming a habit of attention
to the great tran&s;actions of men; by &s;up|plying
their want of experience by that of
others, and by making them in a great
mea&s;ure acquainted with the world, before
they come to act a part in it. 3. At the
&s;ame time the &s;tudents in this Cla&s;s attend
the Profe&s;&s;or of Mathematics for the Ele|mentary
parts, as the knowledge of the
mathematical &s;ciences is an ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
key to the Philo&s;ophy of bodies.</P>
<P>III. As material Objects are the mo&s;t
familiar to young minds, and experiments
and rea&s;onings concerning them are mo&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="32">
level to their capacities, the &s;tudents
in the THIRD year of their cour&s;e, enter on
the &s;tudy of <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Experimental</HI> Phi|lo&s;ophy,
and are in&s;tructed in its &s;everal
branches, Mechanics, Hydro&s;tatics, Pneu|matics,
Optics, A&s;tronomy, Magneti&s;m,
Electricity, and any others which farther
di&s;coveries may add to the parts already
cultivated. 2. They are, as far as time
will allow, in&s;tructed in the principles of
Critici&s;m and the <HI>Belles Lettres.</HI> 3. They
at the &s;ame time continue their mathe|matical
&s;tudies, &s;o as they may go hand in
hand with their &s;tudies in the different
parts of Natural Philo&s;ophy.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">THE profe&s;&s;or of mathematics, the fir&s;t year the &s;tudents are under his care, ex|plains to them the true principles of Arith|metic, teaches Eu$lid's Elements of Geome|try, plain Trigonometry, Practical Geome|try, Geography, and the fir&s;t principles of Algebra. The &s;econd year of their Cour&s;e with him, he teaches Spherical Trigonome|try, Spherical Geometry, Conic Sections, and A&s;tronomy; and carries his pupils for|ward to the higher parts of Algebra. The third year he teaches the highe&s;t parts of Algebra, the Doctrine of the Quadrature of Curves, and Fluxions, and &s;ome parts of Sir I. NEWTON's Principles of Philo&s;ophy.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="33">
IV. IN the LAST year of the Philo&s;o|phic
cour&s;e, are taught, 1. Pneumatology,
or the Natural Philo&s;ophy of Spirits, in|cluding
the doctrine of the nature, faculties,
and &s;tates of the human mind,&mdash;and Na|tural
Theology. 2. Moral Philo&s;ophy,
containing Ethics, Juri&s;prudence and Poli|tics,
the &s;tudy of the&s;e being accompanied
with the peru&s;al of &s;ome of the be&s;t of the
ancient Morali&s;ts. 3. Logic, or the laws
and rules of inventing, proving, retaining,
and communicating knowledge; along
with 4. Metaphy&s;ics.</P>
<P>THE three Profe&s;&s;ors of Philo&s;ophy,
and the Profe&s;&s;or of Greek attend their
&s;tudents, three hours a day as formerly, du|ring
the whole of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of College,
<PB N="34" REF="34">
which commences on the fir&s;t day of No|vember,
and ends in April.</P>
<P>THE order of the &s;ciences now e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
was pretty much ob&s;erved by &s;ome
of the ancient Stoics, particularly PANAE|TIUS
and POSSIDONIUS. EPICTE|TUS
al&s;o in one particular in&s;tance in&s;i|nuates
that he look'd on it as the proper
method.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">E$chirid. cap. 76.</NOTE> It in the main agrees with the
partitions of &s;cience laid down by LORD
VERULAM, and perfectly $uits the ge|nius
of his Philo&s;ophy. It appears to be
that in which the &s;ciences will afford mo&s;t
light to one another, and in which they
will have the mo&s;t u&s;eful influence on life.
It is adapted to the natures and genuine
order of things, and tends to promote the
real knowledge of them. This the Ma&s;|ters
of the Mari&s;chal College have aimed
at in the alteration they have made.
<PB N="35" REF="35">
They have already begun to experience
the public approbation, by the increa&s;e of
the number of their &s;tudents. They have
now publi&s;hed the rea&s;ons which determin|ed
them to it, and leave mankind to judge
of their &s;olidity and &s;trength.</P>
