<HEAD>A
HISTORY
OF THE
CZAR of MUSCOVY.</HEAD>
<P>_PETER ALEXOWITZ, his pre&s;ent
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty; Emperor, or Cae&s;ar,
or King, or Grand Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
call it which we will, who&s;e glorious
Life and Actions are the particular
Subject of this Undertaking, was the younge&s;t
Son, tho' at pre&s;ent, the only &s;urviving Son of
the late <HI>Czar Alexis,</HI> or <HI>Alexyea Michaelowitz,</HI> his
Father left one elder Son, and one Daughter, by a
former Venture; which Daughter was living, till
about the Year 1715, and &s;omething of the Hi|&s;tory
of both Son, and Daughter, may be briefly
under&s;tood, in their Management of Affairs.</P>
<P>THE elde&s;t Son a weak Prince, and $ncapable
of any great Undertaking, was however at fir&s;t
po&s;&s;e&s;t of the Government, and reign'd about &s;ix
Years; dying, as &s;ome have &s;aid by Poi&s;on, by
<PB N="2" REF="3">
the in&s;tigation of &s;ome of the Trayterous <HI>Boyars,</HI>
and in Confederacy with the Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia</HI> his
Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>AFTER his Fathers Death, the pre&s;ent Czar <HI>Peter,</HI>
tho' <HI>Evan</HI> or <HI>John,</HI> his elder Brother was then living,
took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Government, being then on|ly
twelve Years of Age; but afterward there was a
terrible Con&s;piracy, carry'd on by the General of
the <HI>Strelitz$s</HI> or &s;tanding Forces, and underhand
by the &s;aid Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia,</HI> which threw the Go|vernment
into great Covul&s;ions, during which,
many of the Nobility, or <HI>Boyars</HI> who were in the
Intere&s;t of the Czar <HI>Peter,</HI> were Sacrificed in a
mo&s;t bloody manner to the fury of the Soldiers,
and the Per&s;on of the <HI>Czar</HI> pre&s;erv'd, but with in|finite
difficulty by Prince <HI>Gallitzen,</HI> or <HI>Golloffken,</HI>
as &s;ome write him, who &s;natching the young
Prince, as it were by Violence out of the Hands
of the enrag'd Soldiers, hurried him in the Night
out of the Palace, and happily &s;ecur'd him in the
Mona&s;try of <HI>Trotski,</HI> above fifty Miles from the
Court; and then drawing together &s;uch Forces as
were at Hand, and &s;uch of the <HI>Strelitzes</HI> as con|tinu'd
faithful, and making a kind of an Accom|modation;
the two Princes were Proclaim'd equal
in the Government, and the Admini&s;tration car|ried
jointly in both their Names.</P>
<P>THIS kind of Government had perhaps conti|nued
longer, had the Czar <HI>Peter</HI> been of as &s;oft
and ea&s;y a Di&s;po&s;ition, and as willing to be
manag'd by his Si&s;ter <HI>Sophia,</HI> as the Czar <HI>Evan</HI>
appe$r'd to be; but the <HI>Czar Peter</HI> appearing to
be of a manly Genius, an enterprizing gallant
Temper, and a Spirit fi$ted by Nature for Em|pire.
The Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia</HI> ea&s;ily fore&s;eeing the
Termina$ion of her Authority in the ripening
<PB N="3" REF="4">
Age of her younger Brother, fill'd the State with
continual Plots and Con&s;piracies, which at la&s;t
Ended, as &s;uch things generally do, in e&s;tabli&s;hing
the Authority of the pre&s;ent <HI>Czar,</HI> and in her
own Ruin, as &s;hall appear in its Place.</P>
<P>AS to the Czar, <HI>Evan</HI> or <HI>John,</HI> he dyed a|bout
the Year 1691, and left the pre&s;ent Czar <HI>Pe|ter</HI>
&s;ole Governour of the greate&s;t Dominion in
<HI>Europe,</HI> and in who&s;e Reign tho&s;e Dominions have
received &s;uch Additions of &s;trength from an altera|tion
of the Conduct of the Prince, as the like can|not
be &s;hewn in the Hi&s;tory, of any Country in the
World, e&s;pecially con&s;idering that it has been
generally brought to pa&s;s, without any con&s;ide|rable
Conque&s;t of other Princes Dominions, but
chiefly by altering the Oeconomy, the Cu&s;toms,
Manners and Commerce of his own People.</P>
<P><HI>BY this Means,</HI> he has brought a Nation, who
were before the mo&s;t blind and ignorant, and
the greate&s;t contemners of Knowledge, and of all
manner of Learning, to be Searchers after Wi&s;|dom,
&s;tudying Sciences and eagerly bringing Home
Books, In&s;truments, and Arti&s;ts, from the mo&s;t
learned parts of the World for their In&s;truction.</P>
<P><HI>BT this Means,</HI> he has brought his Soldiery,
who were before the mo&s;t Scoundrel undi&s;ci|plin'd
Crowds, Rabbles, rather than Soldiers,
and ju&s;t good for nothing to be regular Di&s;ci|plined
Troops, Cloath'd, Arm'd and Paid like
other Nations, and behaving on all Occa&s;ions in
a manner &s;ufficient to make them formidable to
tho&s;e who us'd to Di&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
<P><HI>BY this Means,</HI> he has reduc'd his People in ge|neral,
to a legal kind of Obedience to their Go|vernors;
not the &s;ame blind kind of Homage they
us'd to pay to their Princes, who they rather
<PB N="4" REF="5">
wor&s;hip'd than obey'd; but, a more polite Re|gulation,
&s;o that now the <HI>Czar</HI> endeavours to
convince their Rea&s;on, of the real Advantages
which his new Laws are to them, at the &s;ame time
that he exacts their Obedience.</P>
<P><HI>BY this Means,</HI> he has regulated their Com|merce,
&s;hew'd them the Profit of a va&s;t Expor|tation
of their own Product to other Countries,
and of the Importation of the Product of other
Countries to them; by which their Wealth daily
encrea&s;es, their People who before had little
Bu&s;ine&s;s, now begin to get Employment, and their
Lands encrea&s;e in Value.</P>
<P><HI>BY this Means,</HI> he has brought his People to be
acquainted with the Sea, and they who had be|fore
&s;carce a Ship of any Con&s;equence, either for
Trade or War in the World, are now able to ap|pear
in the <HI>Balti$k</HI> with a Royal Naval of near
30 Men of War of the Line, Six and Twenty Fre|gat$s,
and 300 Galleys, &s;uch they had in their
great Expedition again&s;t <HI>Sweden,</HI> in the Year 1719,
be&s;ides Tran&s;port Ships, and on board of all,
which as I have been inform'd were employ'd 18000
Seamen, be&s;ides Soldiers, which Fleet are &s;ince ve|ry
much encreas'd, as &s;hall be &s;hewn it its Place.</P>
<P>THE former part of this Princes Reign, was
taken up, either in the Quieting the inte&s;tine
Troubles of his Subjects, the Factions of his Cour|tiers,
and the Rebellions, and Con&s;piracies of the
Nobility and Soldiery, who were continually
rendred Unquiet, and Unea&s;ie to him, by the $word$
Con&s;pira$ies of his Si&s;ter, the Prince&s;s <HI>So|phia,</HI>
and her Creatu$$s, OR in reducing the en|croa$$ing
<HI>Tartars,</HI> on the &s;ide of <HI>A&s;tra$an,</HI> and
the Countr$ of <HI>Circ$a&s;&s;ia,</HI> who &s;everal times gave
him great Di&s;turbance, ravag'd the Country, and
<PB N="5" REF="6">
carried off great Numbers of his People into Sla|very;
but in all his Encounters with the&s;e Peo|ple,
he was follow'd with a Series of continual
Succe&s;s, his Rebels were every where not only
Conquer'd, but entirely Subdu'd, and almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally
fell into his Hands, and &s;o were either cut
off by the Hand of the Executioner, in which
Ca&s;es, tho' the Severities us'd were terrible, yet
they were no other than the Cu&s;tom of the Coun|try
made lawful; or el&s;e, were bani&s;h'd to <HI>Siberia,</HI>
where they are at full Liberty, and yet rendred
entirely uncapable of ever returning to di&s;turb
the Government.</P>
<P>THE utter impo&s;&s;ibility of any Per&s;ons, ex|cept
&s;uch as are at the Head of every Action, gi|ving
any Account of things in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> where no
Records are kept, or Hi&s;tory written of publick
things, makes it not to be expected that I &s;hould
be able to give Journals of the March of Armies,
and exact Accounts of the &s;everal Expeditions of his
Czari&s;h Maje&s;ty to the Southern part of his Do|minions,
either again&s;t his own Rebellious <HI>Circa&s;&s;i|ans,</HI>
the <HI>Calmuck Tartars,</HI> or any other, except
&s;uch as tho&s;e, the Accounts of which we have from
the Hi&s;tory of the other Countries he was engag'd
with, of which I &s;hall give as full an Account as
the be&s;t Intelligence of tho&s;e times will permit.</P>
<P>THE enterprizing Genius of the <HI>Czar,</HI> and
his early attempts to put his Empire in a po&s;ture
of Defence again&s;t the Potent Neighbours who
&s;urrounded it, was not at all agreeable to the com|mon
Notions of the <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI> Building Ships of
War, Entertaining Foreign Arti&s;ts and Engineers,
and laving Schemes according to the Manner of
the other Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> who&s;e way of making
War is &s;o eminently improv'd, were all things
<PB N="6" REF="7">
di&s;agreeable to them, who as they had no Know|ledge
of Arts and Sciences, no Mathematical un|der&s;tandings,
or Sen&s;e of Improvement, &s;o they Ha|ted
and Di&s;pi&s;ed all tho&s;e who knew more than
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>NAY, &s;o eminently were they carryed out in
the E&s;teem of their own Ignorance, that they
made it a Point of Religion, and thought it a
breach of the Laws of God to mingle their Cu|&s;toms
with tho&s;e of other Nations, or to bring
the U&s;age of Foreigners among them; as if Wi&s;|dom
and Knowledge were not to be &s;earch'd af|ter
to the Ends of the Earth, and it were no
lo&s;s to them to be the mo&s;t blind, and uninform'd
Nation in the World.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Czar</HI> &s;aw with other Eyes; it was
ea&s;y to him who had a Penetrating Judgement,
and a Mathematical Head, tho' uninform'd by
the Knowledge of Art, to be &s;en&s;ible of the want
of it; and when he &s;aw the readine&s;s of Foreign
Arti&s;ts, how they acted their Part by Scale and
Rule, and had a whole Sy&s;tem of things in their
Heads, there needed no more for a Prince thus a|ble
to &s;ee the Defect of his own People, and the
Advantage which Neighbouring Nations had o|ver
them on that account; I &s;ay there needed no
more than a Sen&s;e of this, to cau&s;e him to re&s;olve
upon a general Application to the great Work of
informing him&s;elf, and by degrees his People al&s;o in
the u&s;eful Knowledge which flouri&s;h'd among the
other Nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> and to bring them to
receive &s;uch Notions, and &s;uch Cu&s;toms as might in
time render them equal to their Neighbours: If any
Man were to have a true Account of the former
ob&s;tinate Ignorance of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Nation;
how they di&s;pis'd and refus'd all Information,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
how they made it Criminal to &s;uffer any of their
People to travel Abroad, much le&s;s to pretend to
bring Home any experimental Knowledge, or a|ny
Cu&s;toms, however good in them&s;elves, from
other Nations; one wou'd fir&s;t wonder how the
<HI>Czar</HI> came, as it were alone, among his whole Na|tion,
to re&s;olve upon being better inform'd; and
much more how he has been able to Conquer the
ob&s;tinate Ignorance of his People.</P>
<P>NOT that he has Effectually done it yet, or per|haps
ever will; and if his late Son, the Prince of
<HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> had liv'd, 'tis certain he had &s;o little
Ta&s;t of tho&s;e things, tho' he had been Abroad,
that he would have unravell'd all that his Father
had done, and brought the Nation back to their
Native &s;tupidity again.</P>
<P>BUT that ob&s;tacle is remov'd, and &s;o are many
other; the <HI>Czar</HI> lives &s;till, and proceeds to
bring all the <HI>European</HI> Cu&s;toms and U&s;ages into
Fa&s;hion with his People; and in a few Years
more it may happen, that there will be &s;o many
Men of Learning and Judgement found in <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI>
that they will never return again to the bru|tal
Life, which they formerly led; e&s;pecially, if
the Succe&s;&s;or to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;hould hap|pen
to be &s;ome <HI>German</HI> Prince, who may Marry
his Daughter, or that the pre&s;ent Heir apparent
&s;hould live to have a foreign and learn'd Education.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid, that this in&s;ight which the
<HI>Czar</HI> had &s;o early receiv'd, into the Deficiency of
his Countries Cu&s;toms, and the Impre&s;&s;ions
of his own Ignorance, in tho&s;e things, which
a Prince ought to know, were fir&s;t formed by
Conver&s;ing early with one Mon&s;ieur <HI>Le Fort</HI> a
<HI>French</HI> Gentleman, of excellent Parts and Learn|ing,
who he had Entertain'd in his Court, while
<PB N="8" REF="9">
he (the <HI>Czar</HI>) was very young, and who&s;e Con|ver&s;ation
he was extremely Fond of: That
this Gentleman first exited him to Great and He|roick
Actions, fill'd his Mind with generous and
gallant Principles, and at la&s;t recommended to
him to take that happy &s;tep of Travelling in|cognito
thro' all the polite Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that
there he might &s;ee whether what he <HI>Le Fort</HI> had
intimated to him of the exqui&s;ite Management
of things in other Countries were true or not; and
that he might from thence return furni&s;h'd with
Knowledge of all things relating to Peace, War and
Government, and make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of what
ever was Nece&s;&s;ary to make him truly Great, and
&s;o be in time an equal Match for his (at pre&s;ent)
more powerful Neighbours.</P>
<P>IT is the harde&s;t thing in the Worlds for Man
to be Convinc'd of his own Defects, and till he is
&s;o Convinc'd, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to make him apply to Improvement; for who &s;ubmits to be taught
what he believes him&s;elf to know enough of.</P>
<Q><L>If Fools could their own Ignorance di&s;cern,</L>
<L>They'd be no longer Fools, becau&s;e they'd Learn.</L></Q>
<P>BUT here was a Prince arriv'd to the Perfe|ction
of Knowledge, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to know that he knew
nothing; and from this original Sen&s;e of his own,
and of his Peoples Deficiency, he fir&s;t re&s;olv'd to
Travel, that he might Learn every thing, and
then return to be the general Teacher of his own People.</P>
<P>HAPPY Humillity! he Travel'd in que&s;t of
Knowledge, that he might be qualified to be the
Great School-Ma&s;ter of his Subjects; and we &s;hall
&s;oon &s;ee the Succe&s;s in a Manner, &s;uch as the
<PB N="9" REF="10">
whole World can &s;how not One Example of the
like.</P>
<P>BUT to return to his other Enterprizes, before the
great Undertaking of all, which takes up &s;o much
Room in all the Hi&s;tories of the Age. The fir&s;t
of his Undertakings was the reduction of the
<HI>Circa&s;&s;ian Tartars,</HI> who in the infancy of this
Reign had Revolted, or rather made War again&s;t
the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> had pa&s;s'd the <HI>Wolga,</HI> and &s;eiz'd upon
<HI>A&s;tra$an,</HI> where they committed unheard of Cru|elties,
and Barbarities upon the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Army was not in this War Com|manded
by the <HI>Czar</HI> in Per&s;on, but by his Fa|vourite
Prince <HI>Gollofkin,</HI> and under him by &s;ome
foreign Officers, who carried on the War at fir&s;t
with Succe&s;s, but made no great Progre&s;s till the
<HI>Czar</HI> coming in Per&s;on with &s;ome additional
Troops, pu&s;h'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> with &s;uch Vigour, and
u&s;ed his Victrory &s;o effectually, that he brought
the whole Country of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia</HI> to his Obedience:
And &s;ome of his Troops Ravaged the <HI>Crimmee,</HI>
and &s;truck a Terror even into the &s;everal other
Nations of <HI>Tartars,</HI> up to the Borders of the
<HI>Bori&s;thenes.</HI></P>
<P>THIS War brought on another of more
Weight, and indeed of more Danger, and that
was a War with the <HI>Turks,</HI> which it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;s'd,
the <HI>Czar</HI> &s;hew'd his Pollicy in adven|turing
upon at that Time; becau&s;e the <HI>Turks</HI> were
ju&s;t then Embarra&s;s'd in a War with the Emperor
of <HI>Germany,</HI> the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the State,
or Common-wealth or <HI>Venice</HI> all together; &s;o that
they were in no Condition to &s;end any Number
of Men to make their Arms formidable to the <HI>Czar.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11">
UNDER the&s;e fair Pro&s;pects, the <HI>Czar</HI> of
<HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> broke with the <HI>Turks</HI> in the Year, 1694,
and then follow'd a Series of Succe&s;&s;es, which rais'd
the Fame of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Arms above what they
ever reach'd before; but e&s;pecially, gave the
World a ta&s;te of the per&s;onal Valour and Conduct
of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, of whom they had heard
very little till now.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Tartars</HI> who had &s;o long been the Terror
of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> were mi&s;erably Defeated by the <HI>Mu&s;|covite</HI>
Army in Three very con&s;iderale Actions;
of which however, Intelligence coming very &s;low
and uncertain from Places &s;o Remote, and from
Nations who held &s;o little Corre&s;pondence with
the re&s;t of the World; we had no particular Ac|count
till &s;ome Years after, when we were be|holding
to the Relations given of them from the
Memory of &s;ome <HI>Scots</HI> Officers who &s;erv'd in the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Army.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing done in this War, was to clear
the ea&s;tern Banks of the <HI>Wolga</HI> from the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
and drive them effectually into their own Bounds.</P>
<P>THIS had in part been done before, when
Prince <HI>Gollofkin</HI> the Elder, had recovered <HI>A&s;tra|can</HI>
from them. But they &s;till remain'd in great
Numbers on the Calmuck &s;ide, and frequently
made Incur&s;ions into the Countries po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by
the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and Ravag'd far and near, accord|ing
to their u&s;ual Method, making an inexpre&s;&s;i|ble
De&s;olation wherever they came.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Troops the <HI>Czar</HI> &s;ent this way upon
his new Scheme of this War, effectually drove the
<HI>Calmuck Tartars</HI> over the <HI>Wolga;</HI> at the &s;ame
time the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> &s;uch of them as were Subject to
the <HI>Czar,</HI> had fallen upon a great Body of the
<HI>Crim-Tartars,</HI> who had made an Attempt to fall
<PB N="11" REF="12">
into the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Dominions on the &s;ide of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia,</HI>
and gave them a great Defeat, killing 15000 of
them upon the Spot.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, the <HI>Czar</HI>'s General <HI>Gordon</HI> a
<HI>Scots</HI> Gentleman, and an Officer of great Experi|ence
entered into <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia</HI> it&s;elf, and after giving
the <HI>Tartars</HI> &s;everal Defeats, reduced that whole
Country under the Obedience of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
Government, as it remains to this Day.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould have been ob&s;erv'd here, that tho'
the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Militia were not yet brought to the
happy Regulation and Di&s;cipline, they are $ince
by the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Application and Management
arriv'd to; yet they had been much Improv'd,
and were in a much better Condition than they
had formerly been in; and this by the Manage|ment
and Direction of the late Czar <HI>Alexis Mi|chaelowitz,</HI>
the pre&s;ent <HI>Czar</HI>'s Father, who indeed
began to alter &s;everal things in the former un|poli&s;h'd
Method of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Government;
and particularly that of the Army; and remark|ably
in this, that he re&s;olv'd to introduce the
<HI>German</HI> Military Discipline among his Troops;
and to have the Soldiers taught the Exerci&s;e for
the handling their Arms, Marching, Counter|Marching,
Wheeling, drawing up, Forming and
Embattleing, &amp;c. after the <HI>German</HI> Manner. And
to this purpo&s;e, he Entertain'd a great Number of
foreign Officers in his Army, who he Encourag'd
to come out of the Service of all the Princes near
him, by Promi&s;es of large Pay and good U&s;age,
with Preferments according to their Merit, and
which Terms they found very punctually Com|ply'd
with; and his Son the pre&s;ent <HI>Czar</HI> per&s;u|ed
the &s;ame Method.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
BY this means he had at the time of his Un|dertaking
the War I am now &s;peaking of, two
Generals (viz.) <HI>Mon&s;ieur le Fort,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Gordon,</HI>
the fir&s;t a <HI>French</HI> Man, the &s;econd a <HI>Scots</HI> Man,
and above 3000 inferior Officers of &s;everal Na|tions
in his Pay, be&s;ides Engineers, Cannoniers,
Bombardiers, and Firemen in abundance.</P>
<P>AND this was the great Rea&s;on why his En|terprizes
in this War were carry'd on with great
Regularity; his Sieges managed, and Trenches
open'd according to Art; his Batteries, Mines,
Attacks &amp;c. well &s;erv'd; and every thing done
as it ought to be done. Things which in former
Times the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> knew little of.</P>
<P>I am oblig'd to pa&s;s over the fir&s;t Actions of
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Generals in this War, in a
&s;ummary Method, not being able to come at the
particular Days of the Month, or the particular
Circum&s;tances of every Action, nor any Diary
of the March of the Armies, in a time when as
before, &s;carce any thing was done with that Re|gularity,
which has been u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es in
other Countries, and which has &s;ince been better
Manag'd there: Be&s;ides, this was a kind of a
Tumultuary War, the <HI>Tartars</HI> being a People
that made only a kind of <HI>Camp Volant</HI> in all their
Marchings; and in every thing they did, it might
be only &s;aid, that it was by way of Excur&s;ion, and
Incur&s;ion; Plundering and Burning, when they
Advanced, and Runing or rather Flying, when
they Return'd; &s;o that they were only to be Fought,
with by the way of Intercepting them, and by
Surprize; and when at any time they were brought
to Fight, it could never be call'd a pitch'd Battle,
but rather a runing Fight, their whole Army be|ing
<PB N="13" REF="14">
always on Hor&s;eback, for as to an Infantry,
they know nothing of them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> were likewi&s;e
Hor&s;e, tho' not &s;o well Mounted, they, often met
with and routed the <HI>Tartars</HI> too; and that ra|ther,
becau&s;e the mo&s;t Soldiery part of the <HI>Tar|tars</HI>
were at that time Engag'd again&s;t the <HI>Po|landers,</HI>
or in <HI>Hungary,</HI> again&s;t the Imperial Ar|mies,
in Conjunction with the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to come back to the Per&s;on and Conduct
of the <HI>Czar,</HI> it was in per&s;uit of his Conque&s;ts on
this &s;ide, that his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty found how fair
a way lay open to him to make him&s;elf Power|ful
by Sea; a thing which had long lain upon his
Thoughts, but which till now he never had &s;o
much as room to find feazible, or indeed po&s;&s;i|ble;
having no Out-let into any Sea where his
Power might exert it&s;elf: As to the <HI>Wolga,</HI>
tho' it be a very great River, and of a prodigious
extended Cour&s;e, having run above 2500 Miles,
including the Windings and Reaches of its Cour&s;e,
yet there is no depth of Water in the Channel at
the Mouth or Influx of it into the Sea; but the
Sands and Flats of the Shore in the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea on
the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> &s;ide choking up the River, makes it un|capable
to carry Ships of any Force, except at
the time of the Winter Floods; and even then,
the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea it&s;elf for &s;ome Leagues, has no
depth of Water an&s;werable for a Royal Navy of
Men of War, &s;uch as the <HI>Czar</HI> had Projected to
Build.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, had the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea been
deep and every where Navigable as wou'd be &s;uf|ficient,
yet this re&s;pected only the Shores of <HI>Per|&s;ia,
Armenia, Georgia,</HI> and tho&s;e Countries, which
rendered the <HI>Czar</HI> no Pro&s;pect of Glory, or Con|que&s;t.
<PB N="14" REF="15">
But his De&s;igns lay another way, that is
to &s;ay, to open to him&s;elf a Navigation into the
<HI>Black</HI> Sea, where he might either extend his Con|que&s;t
or his Commerce, or perhaps both, into the
le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and even to the Gates of <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople;</HI>
and either by Force or by Treaty, might
obtain a Pa&s;&s;age thro' the Straits of <HI>Hellespont,</HI>
and the <HI>Thracian Bo&s;phorns</HI> into the Mediterrane|an
Sea, and &s;o might e&s;tablish an open Trade be|tween
his Country and the Ports of <HI>Italy, France,</HI>
and <HI>Spain,</HI> and con&s;equently with all the known World.</P>
<P>THIS open'd a Scene of Glory fit for a Prince,
and &s;uited to the great Enterprizes which his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had formed in his Mind: In a
word, here was a Field of Action large enough
to gratifie the Ambition of a Sovereign, Born for
great Things, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an Empire Su|perior
to any of his Neighbours, wanted nothing
but an Entrance upon the Stage of Greatne&s;s, that
he might Act like himelf.</P>
<P>HE &s;aw at once all the great Things which
might be the Con&s;equence of this Conque&s;t in many
Ages to come; and it was from this Judgment
that he had made of Things, that he had purpo&s;ed
to Build a large Fleet of Men of War, even while
the World &s;tood Amaz'd at the My&s;tery of it; &s;ee|ing
they were Built many Leagues up the Coun|try,
on the bank of a River, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The <HI>Don</HI> or <HI>Ta|$$is,</HI>
who&s;e Out-let into the Sea was not in his
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but Bl$ck'd up by the <HI>Turks</HI> with in|numerable
Ob&s;tacles; &s;uch as &s;trong Fortrc&s;&s;es,
narrow Straits, great Batteries, Ships of War, and
the like, particularly, the City and Forts at
<HI>A&s;oph,</HI> the Lines at the Mouth of the River <HI>Don,</HI>
and Works at the Straits of <HI>Caffa,</HI> which la&s;t is,
<PB N="15" REF="16">
the only Entrance into the <HI>Black</HI> Sea, out of that
Sea call'd the <HI>Palus Meotis.</HI></P>
<P>BUT his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's de&s;igns were not to
be Diverted with the Pro&s;pect of tho&s;e Difficul|ties;
and therefore even before he &s;eem'd to aim
at opening the Pa&s;&s;age of tho&s;e Places, or Enga|ging
in any War to bring it to pa&s;s, he employ'd
Agents into <HI>Holland,</HI> and into <HI>England,</HI> to furni&s;h
him with experienc'd Ship-Wrights, and Builders,
in order to build a Royal Navy of Men of War,
even when no Body could fore&s;ee in what Part of
the World they &s;hould be Employ'd; his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty having then not one Port in the <HI>Baltick</HI>
Sea, the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea, or any where el&s;e, except
that of <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> opening to the North Seas, in
the Latitude 72 degrees, where he could have no
occa&s;ion to u&s;e them.</P>
<P>BUT the Event &s;oon di&s;cover'd the Sagacity
of the De&s;ign, for the &s;ame Year the <HI>Czar</HI> having
before been long Solicited by the Confederates,
came into the War with the <HI>Turks,</HI> which was
&s;olemnly proclaim'd the twentieth, of <HI>February,</HI>
1694.</P>
<P>IN pur&s;uance of this War, and of the Mea|&s;ures
concerted with the Allies, the <HI>Czar</HI> appear'd
with two Armies in the Field, the beginning of
the Year 1695, the one con&s;i&s;ting of 90000 Foot,
and 20000 Hor&s;e and Dragoons, Commanded by
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty in Per&s;on, and with which he
march'd into the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian Circa&s;&s;ia,</HI> and entering the
<HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions, &s;at down before <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> an im|portant
Fortre&s;s upon the Banks of the <HI>Tanais,</HI>
near the Mouth of that great River, where it em|pties
it&s;elf into the great Lake, or Sea call'd the
<HI>Palus Meotis;</HI> and the other Army con&s;i&s;ting of
24000 Foot and 36000 Hor&s;e, the latter being
<PB N="16" REF="17">
all <HI>Coa&s;&s;acks,</HI> and was therefore call'd the <HI>Co&s;&s;ack
Army,</HI> Commanded by Lieutenant General Prince
<HI>Czeremetoff,</HI> of whom we &s;hall often have occa&s;i|on
to &s;peak hereafter in the Cour&s;e of this Hi|&s;tory.
This Army march'd by the Way of the
<HI>Ukraine,</HI> and keeping the Cour&s;e of the great Ri|ver
<HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> or the <HI>Neiper</HI> to the Mouth of the
&s;aid River, &s;at down before the &s;trong Town of
<HI>Ka&s;ilkermeen,</HI> a <HI>Tartarian</HI> City, Situated on the
South Bank of the &s;aid River <HI>Neiper,</HI> and within
two Leagues or thereabouts of the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Towns were equally considerable, as
Situated at the two great Enterances into the <HI>Pontus
Euxinus,</HI> neare&s;t to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's&punc; Domi|nions;
and mo&s;t conveniently Seated, both to fa|cilitate
his De&s;igns for the Commerce of his Sub|jects
in tho&s;e Seas, and equally Advantageous to
him for carrying on his farther De&s;ign again&s;t the
<HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>IF the Chri&s;tian World were agreeable &s;ur|pris'd
at the <HI>Czar</HI>'s breaking with the <HI>Turks</HI> in a
Juncture &s;o very Momentous, and &s;o Sea&s;onable
to the Confederates, they were even amaz'd to
find a Prince, of who&s;e enterpri&s;ing Genius they
had yet form'd no Notions, begin a War with &s;uch
apparent Proofs, both of an exqui&s;ite Fore|knowledge,
and al&s;o of a perfect Under&s;tanding
of the Weight and Con&s;equence of what he had
Undertaken; on the other Hand, the manner of
his Entrance into this War, and the formidable
Power with which he began it, gave the <HI>Turks</HI> a
terrible Alarm, e&s;pecially con&s;idering how their
Affairs were at that time Embara&s;s'd in a heavy
War with the Emperor, the King of <HI>Poland,</HI>
and the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> all at the &s;ame time, and
in which they had receiv'd &s;everal terrible Over|throws,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
and had already lo&s;t almo&s;t all the King
of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> all the <HI>Morea,</HI> and &s;everal con&s;ide|rable
Fortre&s;&s;es in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> and other Places, be|sides
having their Millitary Power, broken both
at Sea and Land, by innumerable Defeats of their
Armies and Fleets; but we &s;hall &s;ee them farther
Alarm'd in the proce&s;s of this War, by the Succe&s;s
of his Czari&s;h Maje&s;ty in the Pro&s;ecution of
it.</P>
<P>IT was now too late, that the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;aw their
Mi&s;take, in that having for many Years the City
of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, if they had con&s;i|der'd
it as one of the mo&s;t important Frontiers
of their whole Empire, they would have made it
as impregnable, as the Con&s;equences of &s;uch a
Place requir'd, and as the Situation of it very
well allow'd; for it was mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly Si|tuated
on the North Bank of the River <HI>Don,</HI> with
a low Mar&s;hy Ground oppo&s;ite to it, which was
capable of being &s;o Fortify'd, as appear'd after|wards,
and to be &s;o &s;urrounded with Water, as
not to be any way attack'd, otherwi&s;e than by a
Bombardment, or to be taken, but by a &s;trict
Blockade.</P>
<P>ALL that the <HI>Turks</HI> could do, upon the &s;udden
approach of the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Army, was, to &s;upply the
Want, or Weakne&s;s of the Fortifications, with a
bold re&s;olute Garri&s;on of ten thou&s;and <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI>
all old Soldiers; be&s;ides <HI>Tartars;</HI> and under cho&s;en
Officers, well furni&s;h'd with all things for a vigo|rous
Defence; and this they plac'd the more Confi|dence
in, by how much they had the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI>
&s;till in the utmo&s;t Contempt, as to their Military
Capacity of attacking &s;uch a Place.</P>
<P>NOR did the Garri&s;on di&s;appoint their Ma&s;ters,
or fail in doing their Duty, and in &s;uch manner,
<PB N="18" REF="19">
that altho' the <HI>Czar</HI> attack'd the Place in Form,
and that his Engineers made their Approaches
with the utmo&s;t Skill, and Batter'd and Bombard|ed
the Place with a 100 Pieces of Cannon, and 40
Mortars; yet the Garri&s;on &s;o Harra&s;s'd them with
Continu'd bold and de&s;perate Sallies, and &s;o ply'd
them with a numerous Artillery from the Walls, &s;o
often levell'd the Trenches of the Be&s;iegers, Nail'd
their Cannon, and ruin'd their Works; that the
Winter coming on, and Provi&s;ions growing Scarce,
the <HI>Czar</HI> tho' he was in Per&s;on at the Siege, was
oblig'd to give it over, after having lo&s;t as &s;ome
have reported above 30000 Men before the Place,
and half ruin'd his Calvalry for want of Fo|rage.</P>
<P>BUT Prince <HI>Czeremetoff</HI> had better luck be|fore
<HI>Ka&s;ikermeen,</HI> which tho' it was better Forti|fy'd,
was not &s;o well Defended; and the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI>
pu&s;hing on their Attacks with a de&s;perate Fury,
they carried the Place Sword in Hand, the Gar|ri&s;on
having but ju&s;t time to retreat into two large
Forts, which cover'd the City on the &s;ide of the
River, where beating a Parley, they had good
Conditions granted by the Be&s;iegers, and &s;o the
whole City was taken.</P>
<P>THERE was a complaint made again&s;t the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> General Prince <HI>Czeremetoff,</HI> for &s;uffer|ing
the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> to Plunder the Garri&s;on after the
Capitulation was Sign'd; and that Princes Di&s;|grace
happening &s;oon after, was a&s;&s;ign'd to that
Cau&s;e; but I do not take upon me to &s;ay, this
was the Cau&s;e of it, and as that Prince has been
receiv'd into his Ma&s;ters Favour &s;ince, that, with
very great Reputation, 'tis generally &s;uppos'd,
that he acquitted him&s;elf of that Accu&s;ation.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20">
IF the <HI>Turks</HI> committed an Over-&s;ight an their,
not fore-&s;eeing the Importance, <HI>and Fortifying in
time the City</HI> of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> they were now guilty of
the greate&s;t and mo&s;t inexcu&s;able Neglect and O|mi&s;&s;ion,
in not taking the opportunity of the Win|ter,
when the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Troops were with-drawn, to
&s;end a powerful Succour to the Garri&s;on, that they
might have Defended the Place another Year, as
they had done the Year before.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> left a Body
of Forces in the Country, who as it were, effect|ually
Block'd up the Place by Land; and the
<HI>Turks</HI> neither &s;upplyed the Magazines with Provi|&s;ions,
or reinforced the Garri&s;on with fre&s;h Troops;
both which it was very ea&s;ie to have done by Sea;
the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> having then no Naval Strength at
all: Of both the&s;e there was an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;i|ty,
for the Magazines were not only Empty, the
Ammunition being extremely le&s;&s;en'd in the fre|quent
Sallies and continued Fireings during &s;o
long a Defence, as that of the la&s;t Siege, but the
Garri&s;on was reduced from ten Thou&s;and, to two
Thou&s;and eight Hundred Men.</P>
<P>IN this di&s;tre&s;s'd Condition, they were oblig'd
to &s;u&s;tain the &s;econd Siege, having long &s;ollicited
for Succours but in vain, till it was too late to re|ceive
them, as will appear in the Sequel of the
Story.</P>
<P>DURING the Winter, the <HI>Czar</HI> was not Idle;
the prodigious Preparations made in all Parts of
his va&s;t Dominions, for Recruiting his Army,
Remounting his Cavalry, and &s;upplying the Ma|gazines
with all nece&s;&s;ary Stores of Ammunition,
&amp;c. Intimated plainly, that the Attempt upon
<HI>A&s;oph</HI> was not laid a&s;ide; but that which was
mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all, was the Expedition
<PB N="20" REF="21">
with which his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty furni&s;h'd him&s;elf
with a Fleet in one Winter; and that odd and
extravagant Manner in which &s;ome of the Ve&s;&s;els
were Built, &s;everal of them having been Built
in the River <HI>Occa,</HI> and carried over Land to the
<HI>Dona,</HI> and mo&s;t of the re&s;t at <HI>Voranowitz,</HI> a
Town on a River of that Name, which emplies
it&s;elf into the <HI>Dona</HI> above 300 Miles above <HI>A|&s;oph.</HI></P>
<P>THE Detachment of Troops which the <HI>Czar</HI>
had left to Block up the Place during the Winter,
had maintain$d their Po&s;ts upon the Neighbouring
Hills, and &s;o well &s;cour'd the Country, that the
Garri&s;on of <HI>A&s;oph</HI> had no opportunity of reccive|ing
any Relief or Supply by Land; and early in
the Spring the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops began to arrive,
&s;o that they were actually Be&s;ieg'd again, before
they had received the lea&s;t Recruit.</P>
<P>THE Preparations for this &s;econd Attack, were
&s;o much greater than tho&s;e of the fir&s;t Siege, that
the Garri&s;on had much more need to have been
doubled than le&s;&s;en'd, the Violence they had to
&s;u&s;tain, being &s;o much the greater; for the Artil|lery
the <HI>Czar</HI> had prepar'd for this Attack, were
400 Pieces of Cannon, and 150 Mortars.</P>
<P>THE Expedition us'd in all the&s;e Preparations
was &s;uch, that the Body of the Army arriv'd be|fore
<HI>A&s;oph,</HI> in the End of <HI>April;</HI> but the Rivers
not being open for bringing the Ve&s;&s;els loaden
with Artillery, Bombs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for the Ships
from <HI>Veranowitz,</HI> till the middle of <HI>May,</HI> it was
the beginning of <HI>June,</HI> before the Siege was actu|ally
form'd; all which time the <HI>Turks</HI> had fairly
before them to have relieved the Place; which
however, as if an Ill-fate attended them, they o|mitted
till about the middle of <HI>July,</HI> when their
<PB N="21" REF="22">
Squadron began to appear in the <HI>Black</HI> Sea, and
when they found to their Co&s;t that they were too
late, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> came in Per&s;on to his Army the be|ginning
of <HI>May,</HI> and the Siege begun with the
utmo&s;t Vigour; the Garri&s;on, tho' extreamly re|duced,
and in want of many things, yet defended
them&s;elves with a de&s;perate Valour, rejecting the
Summons &s;ent them in his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Majesty's Name,
by General <HI>Gordon,</HI> with offers of an honourable
Capitulation, and another Summons after that,
threatening them that they &s;hould have no Quar|ter,
if they were taken by Storm.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> General <HI>Gordon</HI> found that the
Ground did not admit of Carrying on Trenches,
&s;o well as could be wi&s;h'd, and the Garri&s;on ha|ving
near 300 Pieces of Cannon upon their Works,
made &s;uch a continual Fire, as ruin'd the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
Batteries; for the &s;aid Batteries being made of a
loo&s;e Sandy Earrh, which would not bear the Weight
of the Artillery. When the Shot of the Town had
but beaten them a little in the Front they fell down;
&s;o that the Guns were di&s;mounted by the Enemy,
with the greate&s;t ea&s;e immaginable: Upon this, the
&s;aid General <HI>Gordon</HI> undertook to carry on a rol|ling
Trench, or rather a rolling Parapet, which
by the help of a multitude of Hands, and near
&s;ix Weeks labour, he brought to &s;uch perfection,
that it terrify'd the Be&s;ieged more than all the
Bombs and Cannon in the Army.</P>
<P>THIS Work was begun at a good di&s;tance
from the Place, and as there were above 30000
Men continually employ'd in it, who reliev'd one
another every four Hours, the Work came gra|dually
rowling forward, the Men behind it &s;till
throwing the Sandy Earth from the bottom, up
<PB N="22" REF="23">
to one another upon Stages, till the uppermo&s;t
threw it quite over the Top, &s;o that at la&s;t they
brought it within half a Mu&s;quet Shot of the
Town, and the height &s;o great, that it overlook'd
the highe&s;t part of the Wall, and all the Ba&s;tions,
to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the Be&s;ieg'd.</P>
<P>DURING all this time, the Batteries for Mor|tars,
which were &s;o effectually cover'd from the
&s;hot of the Ramparts, play'd &s;o ince&s;&s;antly upon
the Town, throwing Bombs Night and Day;
that the whole Town was reduc'd to A&s;hes, and
the Garri&s;on continually Harra&s;s'd with the fury
of the Bombs, no Place being &s;ecure for them; nor
could they appear upon their Works, but they
were immediately knock'd down with &s;mall &s;hot
from the Top of the rowling Trench, which over|look'd
them like a big Mountain, commanding
the Town!: While this was doing from the Land|&s;ide,
the <HI>Czar,</HI> who took upon him&s;elf, the Di|rection
of the naval Part in particular, brought
his Gallies down by a different Channel of the
River <HI>Don,</HI> which as it was out of the reach of the
Cannon of the Town; &s;o there was &s;o little depth
of Water in that part of the River, that no Ve&s;|&s;el
of bulk were ever known to pa&s;s that Way
before, except in Ca&s;es of great Fre&s;hes, or Land
Floods, which were all now over and gone.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Czar</HI> appear'd with a Fleet of Gal|lies
below the Town, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the
Be&s;ieged, who believ'd it impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould
pa&s;s any way, but in the Mouth of their Guns,
which would have been altogether impracticable,
there being above 150 Pieces of Cannon mounted
to defend the Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24">
BESIDES this, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty cau&s;ed &s;e|veral
Batteries of Cannon to be Planted on the
other &s;ide of the River <HI>Donn,</HI> on a &s;mall I&s;land,
which is very properly Situated to prevent Suc|cours
from coming to Relieve the Place; and
behind this I&s;land he placed all his Arm'd Sha|loups
and Brigantines, as in an Ambu&s;cade, to be
ready to &s;how them&s;elves as occa&s;ion &s;hou'd pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>IN this po&s;ture, both the Be&s;iegers and the Be|&s;ieged
expected the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet, which at length
appear'd, bringing Succours for the Garri&s;on;
the Fleet con&s;i&s;ted of 12 large Gallies, 30 arm'd
Brigantines, and about 60 Tran&s;port Ve&s;&s;els, ha|ving
on Board 8000 Soldiers to Reinforce the
Garri&s;on, a va&s;t Quantity of Ammunition of all
&s;orts, Stores of Provi&s;ion, and Cloths for the
Garri&s;on, and 50000 Ducates in Money for the pay
and Encouragement of the brave Fellows, who had
&s;o well behav'd them&s;elves as above.</P>
<P>IT was about the 24th of <HI>July,</HI> that they ap|pear'd
in the <HI>Palus Meotis,</HI> &s;tanding in among the
I&s;lands in the Mouth of the <HI>Donn,</HI> &s;o to enter the
Place; the fir&s;t thing they had to Encounter, was
the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Gallies, who drawing le&s;s Water than
the Great Gallies of the <HI>Turks</HI> lay farther up the
River, where the other could not come.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Saicks and Bri|gantines
to &s;hun tho&s;e Gallies, kept among the
&s;aid I&s;lands in &s;hoal Water, which the <HI>Czar</HI> per|ceiving,
he took a &s;ufficient Number of Troops
into his Shalloups and Brigantines, and re&s;olv'd
to Attack them where they lay, which they did
with &s;uch Bravery and Succe&s;s, him&s;elf ap|pearing
in Per&s;on in the hotte&s;t of the Action,
that the <HI>Turks</HI> were entirely Defeated and Di|&s;pers'd,
and the whole Convoy of Provi&s;ions,
<PB N="24" REF="25">
Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> taken even &s;ight of the Gar|ri&s;on,
not one Ve&s;&s;el being able to reach the
Town.</P>
<P>THIS Overthrow of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet, with the
Succours was follow'd with the Surrender of the
Town; the Garri&s;on Capitulating the 28th of <HI>Ju|ly,</HI>
the <HI>Czar</HI> granting them very honourable Con|ditions,
in Con&s;ideration of that Bravery they had
&s;hewn in Defence of the Place: It was &s;aid, that
when they Surrendred, there was not above 1300
whole Men left of them, who were upwards of
12000 at the beginning of the Siege.</P>
<P>THIS glorious Victory of the <HI>Czar's</HI> &s;urpris'd all
<HI>Europe,</HI> and fill'd every Bodies Mouth with the Per|&s;onal
Fame of his Cazri&s;h Maje&s;ty's Valour and Con|duct,
which was the more talk'd of, becau&s;e it had not
been often, that the World had heard of the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI>
good Conduct, much le&s;s of a Warlike Emperor
at their Head: On this Account and that I may be &s;ure
to leave a full Account of this great Action, I &s;hall
give it in the very Words, in which it was publi&s;h'd
to the World in the &s;everal Countries, from whence
we had then an Account of it; <HI>For Example;</HI> one
Account, and back'd with good Authority, which
came by the way of <HI>France,</HI> is as follows.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty having before-hand re|ceiv'd
Intelligence of the approach of this Suc|cour,
had caus'd &s;even of his large&s;t Gallies of a
hundred Foot in Length each, be&s;ides &s;everal le&s;&s;er,
and a great Number of Brigantines to pa&s;s into
that &s;mall Branch of the <HI>Don,</HI> which i&s;&s;ues forth
a little above the Town. As the Water is very
Shallow in this <HI>Channel,</HI> &s;o it was not without a
great deal of difficulty, that the large&s;t Gallies
could be brought along that Way, and would in
all likelihood not have &s;ucceeded, if the <HI>Czar</HI> by his
<PB N="25" REF="26">
Pre&s;ence and Encouragement, had not animated
the Workmen to &s;urpa&s;s all the Difficulties, which
at la&s;t they did, to the no &s;mall A&s;toni&s;hment of
the Be&s;ieged.</P>
<P>THIS Ob&s;tacle being happily &s;urmounted, his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty judg'd it of very great Con&s;equence,
for his purpo&s;e to plant good Store of Cannon up|on
the little I&s;land we have mention'd before,
becau&s;e the Shoar being very Low, the Cannon-ball
would &s;trike even with the Surface of the Water;
be&s;ides that the greate&s;t part of the I&s;le being
cover'd with Wood, did prevent the Enemy from
di&s;covering the De&s;ign.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame favourable Di&s;po&s;ition of this I&s;land,
furni&s;h'd the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> with an opportunity of
putting &s;ome of their lighte&s;t Gallies and Brigan|tines
for a Re&s;erve behind the I&s;le unperceiv'd by
the Enemy, whom they intended thus to attack
both in the Front and Flank as they pa&s;&s;ed by that
Way, which &s;ucceeded according to Expectation.</P>
<P>FOR all the&s;e Precautions having been made
before, when the Enemies Fleet came in &s;ight, the
bigge&s;t <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Gallies, with many Brigantines
were &s;ent out to meet them, making a &s;how as if
they intended to Engage the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleet; but
no &s;ooner were they come within Cannon-Shot of
one another, but the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> $eigning to dread
the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Fleet, as &s;uperiour to them in Num|ber,
made a running Fight, making the be&s;t of
their way towards the Shoar, and po&s;ting them|&s;elves
below the I&s;land: The <HI>Turks</HI> perceiving the
Enemy to fly before them, and not in the lea&s;t fore|warn'd
of that Plot laid behind the I&s;land, thought
them&s;elves, by the &s;mall Number of the <HI>Mu&s;co|vite</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="27">
Gallies that appear'd in Sight, a&s;&s;ur'd of the
Victory.</P>
<P>FLUSH'D with the&s;e Hopes, they made all
the Sail they could to fall in among the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites,</HI>
but no &s;ooner were they come within reach
of the Cannon from the I&s;le, but they receiv'd &s;uch
a warm &s;alute from thence, that they &s;aw their
Gallies torn to pieces on all &s;ides, by the Enemies
Cannon in an In&s;tant, with a great Slaughter of
many of their Men; but this was only the Fore|runner
of what was to en&s;ue.</P>
<P>FOR his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, who had a watchful
Eye on all Sides, and who was &s;ometimes upon the
I&s;le, &s;ometimes on Board the Fleet of Re&s;erve
that lay behind; having &s;oon ob&s;erved the Con|&s;ternation
the <HI>Turks</HI> were put in by this unexpect|ed
Salute, and willing to improve their Confu&s;i|on
to his Advantage, got on Board in Per&s;on one
of the lighte&s;t Gallies, Mann'd only with forty
Men, giving the Signal for the re&s;t to follow him,
with all the Oars they could. Thus the Enemy
found them&s;elves &s;urrounded on all Sides by the
<HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> who Attack'd them with great Brave|ry;
the <HI>Czar</HI> him&s;elf Boarding the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Admi|ral,
and being &s;ucce&s;sfully Seconded by the re&s;t,
the Victory was almo&s;t as &s;oon compleated, as be|gan.
The <HI>Turks</HI> being Routed &s;o entirely, that
not one Galley e&s;cap'd, but what was either Sunk
or taken; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that the <HI>Czar</HI>
&s;hew'd &s;o much Conduct during the whole Action,
that no more could have been expected, from the
Prudence and Valour of the greate&s;t Captain of
our Time.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Account of this Affair expre&s;&s;es
it &s;elf in the&s;e Words.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28">
AT length it is agreed on all Hands, that the
City of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> had in
vain attempted to Relieve; both by Sea and Land
was Surrender'd to the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> upon Articles
the 28th, of <HI>July;</HI> in pur&s;uance of which, the Gar|ri&s;on
con&s;i&s;ting of three Thou&s;and Men, be&s;ides
<HI>Tartars,</HI> March'd out with their Arms and Bag|gage;
300 pieces of Cannon were found in the
Town, together with a great quantity of Ammu|nition:
But want of Provi&s;ion ha&s;ten'd the Sur|render
of the Town; this Town was formerly
call'd <HI>Tanais,</HI> as being Seated upon the River <HI>Ta|nais,</HI>
now call'd <HI>Don,</HI> the ancient Bounds of <HI>A&s;ia</HI>
and <HI>Europe</HI> to the <HI>North-Ea&s;t:</HI> It is a Town of great
Trade, e&s;pecially in <HI>Furrs,</HI> lying not above 15
Miles from the Mouth of the River, upon the
con&s;ines of <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> but that which makes it
more Con&s;iderable is, that it affords the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI>
and <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> a fair Opportunity to become
Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Euxinus</HI> or <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and gives an
Entrance to the Victor, to penetrate as far as
<HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it&s;elf, for which Rea&s;on, it has been
more than once Conte&s;ted for by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and
<HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI></P>
<P>THE News of this Lo&s;s was known at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI>
upon the 7th, of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> which put the
City into a great Con&s;ternation, for fear of lo&s;ing
tho&s;e Supplies of Provi&s;ions that come to that City
by the <HI>Black-Sea.</HI> They tell us al&s;o, of a Victory
obtained over the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> by the <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI>
near <HI>Precoop;</HI> which Succe&s;&s;es as they re|vive
the Reputation of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Arms, and
render formidable an Enemy; that for &s;everal
Years has hardly been thought worth taking No|tice
of; &s;o the Confequences of their Pro&s;perity,
<PB N="28" REF="29">
may chance to prove more Fatal, then was at fir&s;t
expected to the <HI>Ottomen</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have lain untalk'd of a great
Time, and the <HI>Turk</HI> has look'd upon them, as a de|&s;picable
Enemy for many Years: But 'tis &s;carce to
be imagin'd how &s;oon the change of the Monarch's
Genius, alters the Manners and Conditions of a
Nation; the Warmth and Vigour of Martial
Princes, infu&s;e the &s;ame warlike Motions into
the Brea&s;ts of the People, as the voluptuou&s;ne&s;s
of a di&s;pirited Sovereign effeminates them, and o|verwhelms
them in Sloath and Cowardice. The
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are now another &s;ort of People; they
have a Valiant, and politick Leader, under who&s;e
Conduct they have wre&s;ted one of the chief Barri|ers
of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, from the <HI>Turks,</HI> who
were Vanqui&s;h'd fir&s;t by Sea, and then by Land:
Encouraged thus by Pro&s;perity, what may not the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> do? they want neither Numbers or
Strength of Bodies; and there are few Princes
that can re&s;i&s;t the Temptations of Succe&s;s, &s;o
that it is high time for the <HI>Sultan</HI> to call to his re|membrance,
how often the&s;e <HI>Northern</HI> Deluges,
have proved Fatal to the Empires of the <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>THESE accounts &s;hew the Sentiments of the
re&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> concerning the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
and his Affairs at that Time; and the Advantage
which the <HI>Czar</HI> was repre&s;ented with to the re&s;t of
the Princes of that Age. The <HI>Turks</HI> in particular,
were under a ju&s;t Con&s;ternation, and indeed, they
had Rea&s;on, when they came to under&s;tand that
the <HI>Czar</HI> had Built Men of War at <HI>Veranowitz,</HI>
which carried 700r 80 Guns each, and which would
in Time, be able to Cope with the be&s;t Ships the
Port was able to fit out. This gave them a ju&s;t
Allarm, even at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it&s;elf, which City
<PB N="29" REF="30">
would be but ill able to Sub&s;i&s;t, &s;hould the Free|dom
and Commerce of the <HI>Black-Sea</HI> be taken from
them, or even Di&s;puted with them; and there|fore
the <HI>Turks</HI> are not to be blam'd at all, for the
great Conditions which they Granted the <HI>Czar</HI> of
<HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> afterwards, when they had him as it were
in their Power, for the Recovery of this impor|tant
Place out of his Hands.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Czar</HI> had made this Conque&s;t, he
was far from contenting him&s;elf with letting it
remain in the Condition he found it in; but know|ing
of what Con&s;equence it was to the <HI>Turks,</HI> as
well as now to him&s;elf, he immediately order'd it to
be Strengthned with new Fortifications, and that
of &s;uch a Kind, as render'd it the mo&s;t impreg|nable
Place in tho&s;e Parts of the World; he not
only repair'd the old Works, and added two new
Ba&s;tions to the Body of the Place, but he cau&s;ed a
new Counter&s;carp, with a cover'd Way to be
drawn round the whole, and the Ditch to be Se|cur'd
with half Moons, Lunettes, Tenailles, and
all &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary Out-works, as might render it
Inacce&s;&s;ible; bringing the River <HI>Donne</HI> &s;o into the
Ditches, as that it might be &s;aid, not that the Ri|ver
&s;upply'd the Ditches with Water, but rather,
that the River ran round the Town.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, in the low mar&s;hy Grounds
on the <HI>South-Side</HI> of the River, which the River u|&s;ually
over-flow'd, and which was a meer Bog, his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty cau&s;ed fir&s;t, a firm &s;olid Founda|tion
to be made with Timber, Stones, Gravel, and
the like Materials; and having rais'd the whole
Surface to a con&s;iderable height, above the u&s;ual
Flux of the Water: He Built a Royal Fort upon
it, containing &s;ix Ba&s;tions, with their Cavaliers
Courtins, and Counterguards, with &s;ome Out-Works
<PB N="30" REF="31">
where it was needful; joyning the whole
afterwards to the main Land, with a prodigious
Stone-Bridge of thirty Arches, reaching over the
whole Mora&s;s.</P>
<P>THUS he made the Place truely Impregnable,
there being no Attacking the &s;aid Fort by any of
the u&s;ual Methods of Approach, the whole Ground
round it being to be laid under Water by Sluices
appointed for that purpo&s;e, when ever the Garri|son
found it convenient.</P>
<P>IN this po&s;ture the <HI>Czar</HI> left <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> at the lat|ter
end of the next Year (<HI>viz.</HI>) 1697, and the <HI>Turks</HI>
had as littles hopes of over Recovering it again,
as any Prince could de&s;ire; he al&s;o left it well
&s;tor'd with all manner of military Provi&s;ions,
having above 400 pieces of Cannon mounted up|on
the Works, and Ammunition in proportion;
and left in it be&s;ides, a Garri&s;on of 15000 Men.</P>
<P>AND now it was, that his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
re|solv'd to furni&s;h him&s;elf with a Royal Navy, not
of Gallies and Brigantines, Saiks and Armed
Barks, &s;uch as was the u&s;ual Ve&s;&s;els for tho&s;e Seas:
But of capital Men of War, of 60 to 80 Guns
each, the Magazine and Center of which, and of
the Stores belonging to them, &s;hould be always
laid up at <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> and the Ships them&s;elves be pre|&s;erv'd
in the River <HI>Donn</HI> at proper Places, of
which I &s;hall give a farther Account; waiting till a
convenient Port might be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI>
where they might be laid up and Secur'd.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e va&s;t Thoughts, the <HI>Czar</HI> left the
Place, and cea&s;ed not after he was gone, to go
immediately forward with the Execution of it;
and here may be &s;aid to be laid one of the fir&s;t
Foundations of that Re&s;olution this Prince took
to go Abroad; not only to furni&s;h him&s;elf with
<PB N="31" REF="32">
Skill in all the mechanick Parts of Know|ledge,
nece&s;&s;ary in carrying on &s;uch Undertakings;
but likewi&s;e to furni&s;h him&s;elf with able In&s;tru|ments,
Men of Knowledge and Capacity for &s;uch
Things, that might not only do the Work for him
as Occa&s;ion requir'd, but In&s;truct al&s;o his own
People to do it after them.</P>
<P>AT his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's return from this Con|que&s;t,
he took a Re&s;olution to make a publick
triumphal Entry into his capital City of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI>
and that with all-the Pomp and Splendor that was
po&s;&s;ible to be Devi&s;ed; but it is worth ob&s;erving,
that this was not founded upon the Vanity of
Temper, which Princes have often been &s;ubject to
upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions; but from the true <HI>Roman</HI>
Principle of provoking Emulation in Vertuous
Actions among his Nobility, and for acquainting
his People with the Value and Importance of the
Victory he had obtained.</P>
<P>IN this triumphal Entry it was ob&s;erv'd, that
there was one of his Officers who&s;e Name was <HI>Ja|cob,</HI>
had in the fir&s;t Siege of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> not only De|&s;erted
to the Enemy, but Nail'd up &s;ome of the
<HI>Czar</HI>'s Cannon, and thereby encourag'd the Garri&s;on
to make a de&s;perate Sally on that Side, in
which they ruin'd the Works, and &s;o Di&s;courag'd
the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Soldiers, as was one great Rea&s;on of
rai&s;ing the Siege: This <HI>Jacob</HI> was at the &s;econd
Siege &s;urrender'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> having
refu&s;ed to Grant any Terms to the Garri&s;on, un|le&s;s
he had this Traytor deliver'd up to him.</P>
<P>THIS Wretch made Part of the Triumph of
the <HI>Czar;</HI> he was carried Naked and Chain'd on
a Stage in an open Waggon, with a Gibbet over
his Head; on which, after he had been three times
Tortur'd, he was publickly Hang'd for the Terror
<PB N="32" REF="33">
of Traytors; &s;ome &s;aid he was broken fir&s;t alive,
which however, I do not affirm.</P>
<P>AT this Triumph of the <HI>Czar,</HI> there was an o|pen
Court, and all the Boyars or Noblemen of
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> were admitted to come and Ki&s;s the <HI>Czar</HI>'s
Hand, and pay their Complements on the Occa|sion,
which was a Favour they were not admitted
to formerly, but as the <HI>Czar</HI> re&s;olv'd to acquaint
his People with the Cu&s;toms and u&s;uage of other
Countries, &s;o he began already to make the open
free Conver&s;ation of the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>British</HI> Na|tions
Familiar to them.</P>
<P>AFTER this, the <HI>Czar</HI> call'd them all to an
A&s;&s;embly, where he open'd and explain'd to 'em,
the Nature and Advantages of his Conque&s;ts on
the <HI>Black-Sea;</HI> and how he intended to improve
it to the welfare of his own Dominions, in &s;e|curing
the Navigation of the &s;aid <HI>Black Sea</HI> to
them, by a powerful Navy, and perhaps to obtain
a Commerce even thro' the narrow Chanels, at
<HI>Can&s;tantinople</HI> into the <HI>Levant.</HI></P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e, it was ea&s;ie to convince them
of the Nece&s;&s;ity of building a good Fleet of ca|pital
Men of War, &s;uch as &s;hould be always a
Match for the Grand <HI>Seignior</HI>'s Fleet, and &s;hould
maintain the Commerce if need were by &s;trong
Hand: And at the end of this Di&s;cour&s;e, he ac|quainted
&s;ome of them, that he re&s;olv'd to Tra|vel
in Per&s;on to &s;ome of the Maritime Courts of
<HI>Europe,</HI> to make him&s;elf compleat Ma&s;ter of the
Mea&s;ures of tho&s;e Nations, who were &s;o Superior
to the re&s;t of the World by their naval Strength;
and withal, to bring back with him the be&s;t Ar|ti&s;ts
that could be found; not only to undertake
the Building part for his fir&s;t Fleet, and for the
pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, which admitted no delay; but
<PB N="33" REF="34">
also to in&s;truct his own People in all the nece&s;&s;a|ry
Arts, Handicrafts, and Workman&s;hip which
might be wanting; that &s;o in time none but his
own Subjects might be employ'd, and they might
be capable, in time to come, to make <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> the
Terror of all its Enemies. That they had the
Materials for building and equipping the greate&s;t
Ships in the World, and in &s;uch Plenty, that all
the Marine Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> were oblig'd to &s;eek
to them for their Naval Stores; and it was an un|accountable
Indolence and Neglect, that they
alone &s;hould be ignorant of the building of Ships,
and of the Sea Service of every kind, who were
furni&s;hed by Nature and Providence with the
principal Funds of all Naval Provi&s;ions: That
they had Timber for the Hulls and Ma&s;ts of Ships
enough to &s;upply all the World; Hemp and Flax
for Cordage, Cables and Rigging; Iron for Anchors,
Bolts, Spikes, Nails and Tools; Pitch and Tar for
Caulking, Graving, Paying, and for working and
pre&s;erving the Cordage and Rigging; that all the
Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> were &s;upplyed with tho&s;e things
from <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and it was very hard that <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>
alone &s;hould not know how to u&s;e and apply all
the&s;e for them&s;elves, but that they &s;hould buy and
hire Ships of other Nations, and even of tho&s;e who
fir&s;t fetch'd the materials from <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> by which
tho&s;e Ships were made.</P>
<P>THIS was a Di&s;cour&s;e too rational not to con|quer
the Judgment of any rea&s;onable Creature,
who was not before po&s;&s;eds'd with an invincible
Prejudice. But how far it fail'd to an&s;wer his
Expectation, as to the Impre&s;&s;ions it made on the
Minds of his People, we &s;hall have frequent occa|sion
to &s;ee.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">
BUT <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> is not the only Nation in the

Happy again&s;t their Wills; and in &s;pight of the

that pre&s;ented to rai&s;e the Glory and Reputation

this, was, that in forming the&s;e Factions, and $o|menting
the Trea&s;on I &s;peak of, they brought in
the Clergy to in&s;inuate to the People, that it was
contrary to the Principles of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church to
oblige the People to conver&s;e with Foreigners,
and much more to bring Foreigners in among
them on any pretence whatever; pretending that
they would poi&s;on the People with Erroneous
Doctrines, and Heretical Opinions, and that it was
Dangerous to their Religion; <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>IT is to no purpo&s;e to exclaim here again&s;t the
Ab&s;urdity of the&s;e Things, it is &s;ufficient to my
Hi&s;tory to relate the Fact as it lies before us,
which I &s;hall do in its order as di&s;tinctly as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE Triumph of the Day being over, and the
Traytor <HI>Jacob</HI> executed as above, the <HI>Czar</HI> ap|plyed
him&s;elf with his u&s;ual Re&s;olutions and Vi|gor,
<PB N="35" REF="36">
in per&s;uit of what he had propo&s;ed to him&s;elf
as above: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> he ordered the building &s;uch
Men of War as he had immediate occa&s;ion for,
and to this purpo&s;e tax'd his principal Noblemen
with &s;uch proportions towards the Expence, as he
thought fit, and as by the Cu&s;tom of that ab&s;o|lute
Government he might legally do; allowing
them however this alternative, that if any particu|lar
Nobleman did not think fit to advance &s;uch
&s;ums of Money, and &s;uch numbers of Workmen
as he was Tax'd at, he might take upon him&s;elf
the Work, and build &s;uch Ship or Ships, or &s;uch
part of a Ship, or furni&s;h &s;uch quantity of Mate|rials
as were equivalent to the proportion of Mo|he
was a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty obliged &s;uch
particular degrees of his Boyars and Gentlemen as
he thought proper, to &s;end abroad their Sons into
Foreign Countries, to &s;tudy and to improve them|&s;elves
in &s;uch arts, as were nece&s;&s;ary to qualify
them for publick Employments; particularly Ma|thematicks,
Navigation, Engineering, and the
like; who&s;e Expence however, the <HI>Czar</HI> ordered to
be &s;upplyed out of the publick Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>WHILE the <HI>Czar</HI> was thus bu&s;ied in laying
a Foundation of Glory and Greatne&s;s for his Sub|jects,
<HI>Hard lot of Princes!</HI> his Subjects re&s;i&s;ting
their own Advantages, were Con&s;piring again&s;t
his Life, and in a word form'd the mo&s;t horrid
Trea&s;on again&s;t their Sovereign, and for the cut|ting
off all that were faithful to him, and to the
Intere&s;t of their Country, that has been heard of
in any Age.</P>
<P>It is true the Hi&s;tory, <HI>if the few and loo&s;e ac|counts
that are to be found of this affair de&s;erve the
Name of Hi&s;tory,</HI> of the&s;e things, lay the main
<PB N="36" REF="37">
part of this Trea&s;on upon the Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia</HI> his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Si&s;ter: But as this turbulent La|dy
was a clo&s;e Pri&s;oner on account of former Con|&s;piracies,
and that it was not ea&s;ie for her to cor|re&s;pond
or to carry on any Con&s;piracy with Peo|ple
without Doors, without, giving ground of
&s;u&s;picion; So tho' &s;he might be made acquainted
with the Plot, yet none of the Con&s;pirators,
tho' put to the extrene&s;t Torture, ever charg'd
that Prince&s;s with being the Author of it.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of this Plot as I find it either in the
publick Accounts, or from private Intelligence,
was founded in the Di&s;contents of the Nobil$$y,
at being rated, or tax'd for the building of Ships
of War for the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> after the manner as
above: All the other Pretences were brought in
as an accumulated Charge upon the <HI>Czar,</HI> for im|po&s;ing
Novelties upon them, &s;uch as the &s;end|ing
their Sons abroad to Travel, a thing always
not only avoided, but even forbid in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
and reckon'd or e&s;teem'd to be unlawful; nay,
even the very building of Ships was counted Exo|tic
and Ab&s;urd, and was rendred as a wicked De|sign
to pu&s;h at foreign Conque&s;t, and bringing
War upon the Country.</P>
<P>THE better and more effectually to embark
the Soldiery in the Quarrel, the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> that
is to &s;ay, the &s;tanding Forces of the Empire, &s;uch
as were the Mamalucks in <HI>Egypt,</HI> the Pretorian
Bands in the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, and the Janiza|ries
in <HI>Turky,</HI> were put in mind how hardly they
had been treated; how their number was conti|nually
le&s;&s;en'd by the Executions among them in
the former Tumult at the <HI>Czar's</HI> coming to the Ad|mini&s;tration;
how their number was not made up,
or their Companys recruited, but as they were put
<PB N="37" REF="38">
upon the harde&s;t Services on all occa&s;ions, &s;o their
Companies being not fill'd up, it was apparent
the <HI>Czar</HI> had a mind to wear them out by De|grees;
that the pre&s;ent <HI>Czar</HI> had no Affection for
them, and had vowed their De&s;truction; and that
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had frequently declared he
would &s;uppre&s;s the very Name of them as a Body;
all which, in fact, might be true; for the <HI>Czar</HI>
not only had no occa&s;ion for them, but re&s;olved,
in time, to &s;ink the Name of them out of the
Army.</P>
<P>NOW, much of this might be true (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
the <HI>Czar</HI> having had terrible experience of the mu|tinous
Temper of the Strelitz, and how they often
took upon them to act in a bloody and furious
manner; in&s;ulting the Government, and even
their Prince, pretending to &s;et up or depo&s;e who|ever
they plea&s;ed, had &s;ecretly re&s;olv'd to let them
wear gradually out, and by warm Service and hard
Duty, to wear away as fa&s;t as they could, without
&s;uffering them to be fill'd up or recruited, and he
had abundant rea&s;on to re&s;olve to do &s;o.</P>
<P>THESE Men were therefore the more ea&s;ie to
be brought into any de&s;perate Mea&s;ures, to pre|vent
the annihilation of their Order, and to keep
up the figure they had always made in the Go|vernment;
and as their pretences of Di&s;gu&s;t were
very plau&s;ible and popular, &s;o they were the more
ea&s;y to be brought into the De&s;ign. But &s;till I
mu&s;t leave the dead weight of this Con&s;piracy up|on
tho&s;e People, who, as I &s;aid before, were
pinch'd by the new Order for &s;ending their Chil|dren
abroad, and upon the Boyars who were a|warded
to build Ships of War at their own charge,
they and their Va&s;&s;als as above</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39">
THESE Men provok'd at the Severity of the
<HI>Czar</HI>'s u&s;age of them, as they call'd it, were be|ginners
of the Trea&s;on, but they did not find it
&s;o hard as it might have been expected, to engage
others in it for the Rea&s;ons above-mentioned.</P>
<P>THE building of the&s;e Ships, which had not
been done in <HI>Russia</HI> before, and at the &s;ame time
obliging the Boyars and Gentlemen to &s;end their
Sons abroad to Travel, were both look'd upon as a
great Grievance, the one being not only to entail
a Charge upon them beyond the common Tax,
but of bringing in of Foreigners to build and &s;ail
their Ships; and the latter, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the &s;ending abroad
their Children, was &s;uch an innovation they could
not well bear; Be&s;ides this, it was in&s;inuated
by the Prie&s;ts, that it would be a means of cor|rupting
them in the Principles of their Religion,
and which they held to be a thing that was direct|ly
contrary to the Law of God; adhering to tho&s;e
Texts of Scripture which forbid the Children of
<HI>I&s;rael</HI> to have any Communion with the Nations
that were round about them, that they might not
partake of their Idolatry; for which Rea&s;on even
the Envoys which have been &s;ent heretofore to fo|reign
Courts, have been denied to take their Sons
with them; and upon pain of Death it was forbid
that any <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> &s;hould go out of the Country
without e&s;pecial leave from the Patriarch; but
they now murmured that the <HI>Czar</HI> wholly adhered
to Strangers, went him&s;elf daily to their Hou&s;es,
and freely admitted them to his Conver&s;ation,
which &s;tirred up the di&s;contents of the Party that
were out of favour at Court, and who had been
made unea&s;y at their di&s;appointment &s;ince the
la&s;t Rebellion; who were &s;till in the Intere&s;t of
the Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia,</HI> and wanted to be them&s;elves
<PB N="39" REF="40">
at the head of the Government, they therefore
take this opportunity in hopes to give a turn to
Affairs, and that they might effectually bring
about their Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT to come to the matter of fact, the Con|spiracy
being laid deep as Hell, and cruel as Death,
is de&s;crib'd by one of the Writers of that time in
the following words:</P>
<P>&startq;NOTWITHSTANDING that the whole
Empire &s;eemed to take &s;hare in the glorious
Conque&s;ts of their Prince, and that nothing but
Fea&s;ting and Rejoicing were to be &s;een in all
parts during the whole Winter, there remained
neverthele&s;s a certain di&s;contented Party among
the Nobility, who being encouraged by the &s;e|cret
Cabals of the Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia,</HI> found means,
in &s;pight of her confinement, to keep an under|hand
Corre&s;pondence with her for the promo|ting
their de&s;igns again&s;t the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Per&s;on;
they were &s;o well prepared for the undertaking
of any Enterprize of this nature, that there
wanted but little Fuel to kindle the Flame,
they could not brook the lo&s;s of their beloved
Strelitzes, whom they had always looked upon
as the chief Supporters of their Authority,
which at la&s;t made them conceive &s;o implacable
a hatred again&s;t the <HI>Czar,</HI> that they entred in|to
a Con&s;piracy again&s;t his Life; to put their
Design in execution, they had brought over to
their Party four Captains of the fir&s;t Regiment
of Strelitzers; but the difficulty was, in what
manner the Attempt was to be made, for they
looked upon it as impracticable to declare open|ly
again&s;t a Prince, who, be&s;ides that he was
much beloved by the People, had at his Devo|tion
a good number of the be&s;t Troops, com|manded
<PB N="40" REF="41">
by foreign Officers, who were quarter|ed
in and about the City of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> and ready
upon all Occa&s;ions to Sacrifice their Lives for
his Maje&s;ty; it was propo&s;ed among them, that
the <HI>Czar</HI> was u&s;ed to go &s;ometimes abroad with
very &s;lender Attendance, and to appear in the
Streets of <HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> without any con&s;iderable Re|tinue;
this was al&s;o look'd upon as too dange|rous,
con&s;idering the general Love the People
bore to the Per&s;on of the <HI>Czar.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;AFTER many Debates it was at la&s;t re&s;olved,
that con&s;idering the <HI>Czar,</HI> who takes &s;hare in
every thing that concerns his Subjects Welfare,
was wont to appear in Per&s;on, in ca&s;e of any
accident of Fire, which frequently happens,
and makes mo&s;t terrible havock in the City of
<HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> where most of the Hou&s;es are of Wood;
they looked upon this as the mo&s;t proper op|portunity
to encompa&s;s their De&s;ign; where|fore
it was concluded to &s;et Fire to &s;ome Hou&s;es
in the night time, when they did not que&s;tion
to draw the <HI>Czar</HI> thither, and during the con|fu&s;ion,
to find means to A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him. The
next thing to be done was, according to their
own Confe&s;&s;ion, to have joined the <HI>Donaick Co&s;|&s;acks</HI>
with their Party, to have relea&s;ed the
Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia</HI> from her Confinement, recalled
Prince <HI>$$a&s;&s;ily Galickzin</HI> out of <HI>Siberia,</HI> and &s;urren|dred
the Admini&s;tration of the Government in|to
their hands, who were also to re&s;tore the Stre|litzes
to their antient Station.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS was the Sub&s;tance of the Plot, and to car|ry
it on more effectually, four Captains of the Stre|li$zes,
or Troops of the Hou&s;hold were brought
into it, be&s;ides &s;everal great Men as well in the
Court as in the Army.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="42">
THE Attempt was now ripe for Execution,
and a great number of the Strelitzes were come pri|vately
into the Town to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the horrid work
of murthering their Sovereign, and perhaps at
that of de&s;troying the whole City; for any one
that knows the City of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> how that not on|ly
the Hou&s;es, but even the Pavement, as we call
it of the Streets, are all of Wood; and what ha|vock
a Fire often makes among them, may ea&s;ily
&s;uppo&s;e, that the City being wilfully fired in three
places, and the People being put into &s;uch a Fright
and Confu&s;ion, as would have been the ca&s;e at the
murther of their Emperor, and of &s;uch bloody and
cruel Executions, or rather Butcheries, as would
nece&s;&s;arily have follow'd &s;uch a thing, the nece&s;&s;ary
care for extingui&s;hing the Fire would be omitted
in a great mea&s;ure, and perhaps the greater part
of the City had been de&s;troy'd, which is horrible
but to think of.</P>
<P>THE Day appointed for the Execution was the
20th of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1697, when the Evening before two
of the Captains of the Strelitzers, namely, Cap|tain
<HI>Largou Gili&s;aroski</HI> and Captain <HI>Greg Siteri,</HI>
went and di&s;covered the whole Plot to the <HI>Czar,</HI>
who was then at Supper at Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Fort</HI>'s, a
<HI>French</HI> Gentleman, of whom mention is often
made in this Relation. The account of the Di&s;|covery,
with the Name and Fate of the Con&s;pi|rators,
take in a few words from another Pen as
follows.</P>
<P>&startq;It was on the fir&s;t Day of <HI>February</HI> in the
Year 1697, when his Maje&s;ty was informed
concerning this Con&s;piracy formed again&s;t his
Life, at the Hou&s;e of General <HI>le Fort,</HI> were he
happened to dine that Day; he appeared very
little moved at &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing a piece of News;
<PB N="42" REF="43">
but without any change in his Countenance, aro&s;e
from the Table, and being followed only by a few
Persons in whom he confided mo&s;t, he went di|rectly
to the Hou&s;e of one of the Con&s;pirators,
who&s;e Name was <HI>John Sickler,</HI> and elevated by
the <HI>Czar</HI> to the chief Dignity of a Coun&s;ellor of
State. When his Maje&s;ty came to the Hou&s;e of
this wicked Wretch, he commanded the re&s;t to
remain without Doors, and he him&s;elf entred, only
with three Gentlemen more, and pretending he
had occa&s;ion to ask his advice in &s;ome matter
of moment, ordered he &s;hould follow him; but
no &s;ooner was he come into the Street but he
was &s;eized and immediately carried to Pri&s;on,
as were likewi&s;e five more, to wit, the Boyar
<HI>Alexis Sekonnin, Feodore Puskin,</HI> Son of the Boyar,
<HI>Matfefeoa Puskin,</HI> Ten Captains of the Strelitzes,
and a <HI>Donaick Co&s;&s;ack;</HI> they all confe&s;&s;ed their
Crimes, and being condemned by all the Boyars,
were executed on the fifth Day of <HI>March</HI> in the
Year 1697, in the great Market-place before
the Ca&s;tle. Fir&s;t their Arms and Legs were cut
off, then they had their Heads &s;evered from
their Bodies; their Heads were fixed on the top
of a Stone Column erected for that purpo&s;e,
and their Arms and Legs &s;tuck upon Iron Bars
round about it; the Trunks of their dead Car|ca&s;&s;es
were left in the Market-place for eight
Days after, till the &s;cent became &s;o nau&s;eous to
the Inhabitants, that they were forced to be re|moved
from thence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;IT having by confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of the Con|&s;pirators
been made apparent, that the Boyar
<HI>Ivan Milo&s;laski</HI> was the chief Head of the Rebel|lion
which happened in the Year 1682, immediately
after his pre&s;ent <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Ac|ce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="43" REF="44">
to the Crown, his Body was di&s;interred,
which being found very near entire, without
any con&s;iderable decay, tho' it had lain under
ground near twelve Years; &s;everal Gibbets
were erected, on which were hung the Quarters
of the Carca&s;s, which were torn to pieces in an
in&s;tance by the enraged Multitude.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Severity of the Executions in this Ca&s;e
are excu&s;ed by their being at <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> where Ex|perience
has taught them, that &s;uch Executions
are needful; and where if &s;uch a &s;evere cour&s;e had
not been taken, it might have been hard to per|&s;wade
the People to believe that the Con&s;piracy
had been real, or the Government in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>WHEN his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had ma&s;ter'd the&s;e
Commotions, and all things were calm again, the
<HI>Czar</HI> who was now &s;o re&s;olv'd upon his De&s;ign, as
that nothing could divert him, I mean as to his
Travelling Abroad, began to prepare publickly
for his going, and to let the &s;editious Boyars
know that he was not under the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;i|ons
from any thing they were able to do in his
ab&s;ence, he made it publick al&s;o, in who&s;e Hands
he re&s;olved to entru&s;t the Government in his ab|sence:
He appointed a good Army to Encamp
within a League of the City of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> of whom
a &s;trong Detatchment were to do Duty daily at
the Palace; and among all the&s;e Troops which
amounted to 22000 Men, it was e&s;pecially pro|vided,
that none of the Strelitzers were allow'd,
intimating, that the <HI>Czar</HI> who had re&s;olv'd to &s;up|pre&s;s
effectually that body of Men, did not think
them worthy to be entru&s;ted with the protection of that Government which they had so often at|tempted
to di&s;turb.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45">
WHILE this was doing, Expre&s;&s;es came fre|quently
in from <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> and from General <HI>Skeen</HI>
who commanded the Army there, with News of
Advantages gain'd every Day over the Tartars
and Rebel <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> of whom great numbers were
often cut off; and that General, who is a vigilant
Officer, daily extended his Quarters in the <HI>Crim Tar|tary,</HI>
ravaging the Country and bringing in a great
Booty: So that all things went on that &s;ide
to his mind; and as the <HI>Turks</HI> had their Hands full
in <HI>Hungary</HI> with the Imperiali&s;ts, who had beaten
them in &s;everal great Battels, and continued their
Conque&s;ts till even <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it &s;elf began to
tremble at them, they were in no condition to do
any thing towards the recovery of <HI>A&s;oph;</HI> &s;o that
the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Affairs were in a mo&s;t Formidable Po&s;ture
on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>THE Preparations for the intended Progre&s;s
of the <HI>Czar</HI> were now fini&s;hed; and tho' I cannot
&s;ay I have a full account of them, neither perhaps
was any full account ever publi&s;hed; yet, as I
believe, the following Particulars are rather &s;hort
of, than an over reckoning of the va&s;t Trea&s;ure and
Expence furni&s;hed on this Occa&s;ion, I &s;hall tran&s;mit
it as I find it, leaving the Reader to judge of
the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Truth of the Relation by
the Particulars they will meet with in the account
of the Journey.</P>
<P>IT was for &s;ome time unre&s;olv'd in what Ca|pacity
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;hould Travel, and &s;e|veral
Propo&s;itions were con&s;idered of, as particu|larly
fir&s;t, that he &s;hould go as a private Gentle|man,
and with a &s;mall Retinue, which was the
fir&s;t Propo&s;al. (2.) As a Clergy-man of the <HI>Greek</HI>
Church, as had been practi&s;ed by &s;ome of his
boyars the Year before. (3.) As an <HI>Armenian</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="46">
Merchant, under which Di&s;gui&s;e &s;everal <HI>Per&s;ians</HI>
and <HI>Turks</HI> had travelled into <HI>Europe;</HI> for as to go|ing
publickly, and owning him&s;elf to be what he
really was, <HI>Czar</HI> or Emperor of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> that the
<HI>Czar</HI> him&s;elf had re&s;olved again&s;t for many &s;ub|&s;tantial
Rea&s;ons; as, (1.) The Expence of it.
(2.) The lo&s;ing the opportunity of in&s;pecting per|sonally
into things, which he had with great Rea|&s;on
&s;een could not be done but in a private Capa|city.
And (3.) Becau&s;e the whole time would be
taken up in Shows and Ceremonies, things below
the important De&s;ign of the Journey, and utterly
incon&s;i&s;tent with it. At length Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Fort</HI>
propo&s;ed what the <HI>Czar</HI> immediately approved, a
method which as he &s;aid would con&s;i&s;t both with
the Honour and Safety of his Maje&s;ty's Per&s;on,
and yet give him all the opportunity of a Con|cealment
that he could de&s;ire, and this was, that
a &s;olemn Emba&s;&s;y &s;hould be &s;ent from his Maje&s;ty
to all the Courts to which he had intended to go,
with a Compliment of Honour, and Propo&s;als of
Amity and Commerce; and Amba&s;&s;adors to be
ve&s;ted with full Plenipotentiary Powers to enter
into Treaties of Alliance and Treaties of Com|merce
with the &s;aid Nations re&s;pectively; and
that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould Travel <HI>Incognito</HI> in the
Retinue of his &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adors, and under the
Protection of the Emba&s;&s;y it &s;elf, by which means
it would at the &s;ame time be known that he was
per&s;onally pre&s;ent, and thereby his Emba&s;&s;y
would be receiv'd with the greater Di&s;tinction;
and yet as he would be at liberty to receive all
po&s;&s;ible Ceremony and Honour where he thought
fit to accept it, &s;o he would be at liberty to de|cline
it al&s;o, as he found occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">
THIS hit his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Thoughts imme|diately,
and was &s;o perfectly agreeable to his
whole De&s;ign, which was to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter
of all the Methods of the Nations he intended to
pa&s;s thro,' in the management of their Military
and Naval Affairs; and particularly of all Ma|thematical
and Mechanical Knowledge, which he
pre&s;ently fore&s;aw he &s;hould by this Method be

<P>THIS being therefore re&s;olv'd on, &s;everal

<P>1. WHO &s;hould be the Amba&s;&s;adors appointed
for this Honourable Po&s;t.</P>
<P>2. WHO the Government &s;hould be committed
to in the <HI>Czar</HI>'s ab&s;ence. what Power &s;hould

<P>6. THE determining who &s;hould be appointed

<P>THE re&s;olving the&s;e Particulars took up &s;ome

great deal of Prudence and Caution.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="48">
THE Choice of the Per&s;ons of the Amba&s;&s;adors
fell upon the&s;e three; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> General <HI>le
Fort</HI> Captain of the Guards, and at that time Ad|miral
of the Fleet, who, as he was a <HI>Frenchman</HI>
born, had liv'd many Years at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and
&s;ome time in <HI>Italy,</HI> &s;o he in the fir&s;t place was
fully acquainted with all the Cu&s;toms and Man|ners
of tho&s;e Countries, and capable of advi&s;ing in
the particular Mea&s;ures to be ob&s;erv'd in each
Country; and of the Ceremonial; as well what
Re&s;pect was to be &s;hewn, as what was to be ex|pected
where-ever they came; and in the next
place, as he knew the Language, &s;o he &s;erv'd the
<HI>Czar</HI> as an Interpreter upon the mo&s;t important
Occa&s;ions. The next was <HI>Theodore Alexiamvitz
Golloffkin,</HI> a Grave Maje&s;tick Per&s;on, and fully ac|quainted
with the Intere&s;t and Trade, as well as
the Laws and Cu&s;toms of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and how to
carry on any Treaty of Commerce, or receive
Propo&s;als for the Advantage and Intere&s;t of Trade;
having been Chancellor of the whole Empire, and
the &s;ame who formerly made the Treaty of Peace
between his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty and the Emperor of
<HI>China,</HI> of which we &s;hall &s;peak in its place, and
who had been twice by Land at <HI>China</HI> in the Qua|lity
of Amba&s;&s;ador and Plenipotentiary to the
Emperor there. The third was call'd, <HI>Proco|$et
Bodgnanovitz Woluitzin,</HI> who had been employ'd
in &s;everal Emba&s;&s;ies to the Grand Seignior, and
was perfectly acquainted with his Ma&s;ter's Inter|e&s;ts,
with re&s;pect to the <HI>Turks,</HI> the &s;ettling Limits,
the Affair of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> and in any thing el&s;e that
might happen on that &s;ide, e&s;pecially if at <HI>Vienna</HI>
any Propo&s;als of an Accommodation &s;hould be
made to the Emperor and his Allies.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="49">
THESE were the three Amba&s;&s;adors to whom
the whole Affair was committed; nor were there
three Men equally capable to &s;o great a Work in
his whole Dominion; and as his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
was always with them, there was no occa&s;ion of
any delay, or &s;pinning out the Negotiations, as is
u&s;ual in other ca&s;es.</P>
<P>THE General <HI>le Fort</HI> was made fir&s;t Plenipo|tentiary,
and con&s;equently was at the Head of this
Emba&s;&s;y, being partly qualifyed by his Know|ledge
in the Languages and Cu&s;toms of <HI>Europe</HI> as
above, to appear at the head of all the Negotia|tions.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd Article (<HI>viz.</HI>) who the Admini|&s;tration
of the Government &s;hould be committed
to in the <HI>Czar</HI>'s ab&s;ence, was &s;oon re&s;olv'd by the
<HI>Czar</HI> him&s;elf, who pitch'd upon the Princes <HI>Na|riskin,
Procorofski,</HI> and <HI>Boris Galitzen,</HI> all faith|ful
Servants of the Crown, and &s;teady in the Per|sonal
Intere&s;t of the <HI>Czar;</HI> the fir&s;t being the <HI>Czar</HI>'s
Mother's own Brother and prime Mini&s;ter; the
&s;econd the Grand Receiver, or Lord Trea&s;urer,
an ancient faithful Prince, always &s;teady to the
<HI>Czar</HI> and to his whole Family; and the third a
particular Favourite, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;everal high Tru&s;ts
in the Government, and va&s;tly rich al&s;o him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE Military Tru&s;t was committed to Gene|ral
<HI>Skeen</HI> or <HI>Scherin,</HI> who was made Generali&s;&s;imo
for all that concern'd the War again&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI>
and <HI>Tartars</HI> on the Borders of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and
on the &s;ide of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia;</HI> and to General <HI>Gordon,</HI> a
<HI>Scots</HI> Man, for what concern'd the Guard of the
Palace and Capital City of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> and all the
Northern Parts of the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Dominions: The
former had under his Command the whole Army
<PB N="49" REF="50">
at and in the Neighbourhood of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> or from
<HI>A&s;tracan</HI> to <HI>Kai&s;erkameen</HI> on the <HI>Bori&s;thenes;</HI> and
the other had the Command of the re&s;t of the Troops,
as well at <HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> as afore&s;aid, as on the Frontiers
of <HI>Poland</HI> and of <HI>Sweden, Courland, &amp;c.</HI> and had
in particular the Charge given him of Protecting
the Admini&s;tration in the hands of the three
Princes above-mentioned.</P>
<P>3. THE third Article was to con&s;ider what Na|tions
or Courts this Emba&s;&s;y &s;hould be directed
to, and this was &s;oon determined; the Rout or
Cavalcade being ordered to pa&s;s forward thus;
Fir&s;t to <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> and the Court of <HI>Berlin.</HI> II. To
<HI>Holland.</HI> III. To <HI>England.</HI> IV. To <HI>Vienna</HI> to the
Emperor. And La&s;tly, to <HI>Venice:</HI> The&s;e being
the Capital places where Military and Naval
Knowledge were now to be found in the greate&s;t
Perfection; except in <HI>France,</HI> which for weighty
Rea&s;ons his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd not to go
to <HI>France,</HI> at that time, being engaged in a heavy
War again&s;t almo&s;t all the other Princes of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI></P>
<P>4. THE next Head was the Funds for the Ex|pence
of this Journey: This the <HI>Czar</HI> took up|on
him&s;elf to direct; and I am a&s;&s;ur'd that his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;et apart for this Work above two
Millions of Rubles, which in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Money is near
800000 Pounds Sterling; but I do not po&s;itively
affirm that &s;o great a Sum was taken: Mo&s;t of
this Money, be the Sum what it will, was ex|pended
in buying Ships, materials for forwarding
&s;everal Sciences for the publick u&s;e in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> as
al&s;o for buying Arms, Artillery and Ammuniti|on
to be &s;ent to <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI></P>
<P>5. THE Povi&s;ion for Pre&s;ents to be made to
&s;uch Princes, and States where they were to appear
<PB N="50" REF="51">
in Ceremony, and for Audiences, for which
purpo&s;e twenty large Bales of the riche&s;t Furs,
&s;uch as Sables, Ermins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were provided, and
&s;everal Bales of rich Cloth of Gold made in
<HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Georgia;</HI> and &s;everal Parcels of very
valuable Jewels, as al&s;o &s;ome fine <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and
<HI>Tartarian</HI> Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>6. THE determining who &s;hould be appointed
to Travel with the <HI>Czar;</HI> and this Article was ve|ry
Significant, as it intimated that the <HI>Czar</HI> took
with him about Forty Per&s;ons of the Prime Rank
in his Dominion, or their Sons; This was call'd
an Honour done them, but was wi&s;ely determined
to &s;ecure them from Plotting and Con&s;piring a|gain&s;t
him during his ab&s;ence: In the mean time
&s;uch other Noblemen as were Di&s;tru&s;ted, or out of
Favour, were commanded to retire to their own
Seats, and not to come to the City of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> or
to Court on pain of Death.</P>
<P>HAVING thus with an inimitable Conduct
a&s;&s;ur'd things at home to his full Satisfaction,
and having taken of the Foreign Merchants in his
Dominions Bills of Exchange upon Merchants in
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> for a great part of the Trea|&s;ure
he had appointed for his Journey; and all
things being ready to depart; the Baggage was &s;ent
before with a &s;trong Guard, and having obtained
proper Pa&s;&s;es for the whole Emba&s;&s;y for <HI>Koning&s;|burgh,</HI>
a City in the Ducal <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> belonging to the
King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> then Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> his

IT was &s;aid his Maje&s;ty receiv'd &s;ome ill Treat|ment
at <HI>Riga,</HI> that is to &s;ay, they declin'd &s;ati&s;|fying
his Curio&s;ity in letting him view the Works
and Forts in the manner he de&s;ir'd; and as it was
the fir&s;t Town compleatly fortified after the <HI>French</HI>
manner, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was the more pre&s;&s;ing
to make his Ob&s;ervations, which they not admit|ting,
extremely di&s;gu&s;ted him; but he has had op|portunity
to remember it &s;ince, to the Co&s;t of
the <HI>Swedes,</HI> from whom he took not that City only,
but the whole Province in a few Years after, and
remains po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of them to this Day; and 'tis
ob&s;erved that the Re&s;entment of the U&s;age of his
Amba&s;&s;adors, for he does not take notice of his
being in Per&s;on with them, is mentioned in his
Declaration of War again&s;t <HI>Sweden,</HI> as one of the
Cau&s;es of his breaking the Peace with them.</P>
<P>BUT he found him&s;elf treated after a quite
different manner at the next Place of Note he
came to, which was at <HI>Koningsberg</HI> the Capital of
the Ducal <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> as above: Hither the Duke of
<HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> &s;ince King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> came with his
whole Court to receive and entertain him; and
here the <HI>Czar</HI> re&s;olv'd to &s;how the World the fir&s;t
Specimen of his Glory and Greatne&s;s. His Em|ba&s;&s;y
had hitherto a Retinue of Three Hundred

&s;ome with Bows, &s;ome with Battle Axes, and o|thers
with Lances; and abundance of the young
Nobility, who afterwards were di&s;pers'd to other
parts, were at this fir&s;t Entry.</P>
<P>THE manner of this glorious Entry, as it was

After Dinner, Mr. <HI>Be&s;&s;er,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of
the Ceremonies, arriv'd at the &s;ame place al&s;o,
with a great company of Nobility to conduct
them to the City, at what time their Excellen|cies
taking Coach with M. <HI>Dunkelmen,</HI> and M.

Fir&s;t came his Electoral Highne&s;&s;es Led Hor&s;es,
to the number of Forty. Secondly, an Officer
attended by the Kettle Drums of the Guards,
and Three Troops of the Guards of the Body
clad in Red; next the principal Nobility of
Ducal <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> in Twenty Six Coaches with Six
Hor&s;es, then two of the Elector's Coaches, and
One of the Margrave <HI>Albert</HI>'s; after them the
Court Pages Two and Two, with a Page of the
Amba&s;&s;adors between 'em in Red Liveries Lac'd
with Gold Lace. Sixthly, the chief Mini&s;ters
and Officers of the Elector's Hou&s;hold in Thirty
Six Coaches. Seventhly, the fir&s;t Kettle-Drum,
and the fir&s;t Trumpet belonging to his Electo|ral
Highne&s;s, follow'd by the Amba&s;&s;ador's Foot
Guards clad in Green, with each a Silver Bat|tle
Axe upon his Shoulder; then Thirty of the
Amba&s;&s;adors Hor&s;e-guards in the &s;ame Livery,
but without Battle Axes. Ninthly, the Coach

wherein their Excellencies rode. La&s;tly, the
march was clos'd with twelve Coaches fill'd
with <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Gentlemen and <HI>Brandenburghers.</HI>
Their Excellencies being thus conducted over
the <HI>Karkerbrug</HI> to a magnificent Lodging pre|pared
for 'em in the long Street of <HI>Kneiphoff,</HI>
the Burghers being drawn up in a double File,
and lining the Streets all the way, and a trip|ple
di&s;charge of all the great Guns &s;aluting
them from their entrance into their Lodging,
where the Garri&s;on of the City &s;tood to re|ceive
them: So &s;oon as they alighted they were
conducted to their Apartment, which was guard|ed
by twenty Soldiers; and then the Lords of
the Court, together with M. <HI>Dankelman,</HI> and
the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies left 'em, and
were waited on by the Amba&s;&s;adors to the Stairs
of the Hou&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;UPON the Fourth of this In&s;tant, <HI>N. S.</HI> they
had their Publick Audience of the Elector, to

Amba&s;&s;adors went Thirty Per&s;ons carrying the
<HI>Czar</HI>'s Pre&s;ent to the Elector; the Amba&s;&s;adors,
who were richly habited in Cloth of Gold
and Silver embroider'd with precious Stones,
being enter'd into the great Hall of the Ca&s;tle,
where the Elector was &s;eated upon a Throne
attended by the principal Lords of his Court,
made their Reverences; and after they had
every one in their order complimented the E|lector
in &s;hort but &s;ignificant Speeches, they
deliver'd him the Pre&s;ent, and a Letter pur|porting,
that the <HI>Czar</HI> had &s;ent the &s;aid Em|ba&s;&s;y
to his Electoral Highne&s;s to a&s;&s;ure him of
<PB N="54" REF="55">
his de&s;ire to improve the Affection and good
Corre&s;pondence which had always been, as well
between him, as his illu&s;trious Ance&s;tors. That
the &s;ame Emba&s;&s;y being from thence to pro|ceed
to the Court of <HI>Vienna,</HI> in order to farther
Con&s;ultations and Propo&s;itions for the continu|ance
of the War again&s;t the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI>
His <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Maje&s;ty therefore reque&s;ted the
Elector to a&s;&s;i&s;t 'em in their Journey, withal
returning his Electoral Highne&s;s thanks for the
Engineers and Bombardiers which he &s;ent him the
la&s;t Year, and which had been &s;o u&s;eful to him
in the Siege of <HI>A&s;oph:</HI> To all which the E|lector
an&s;wer'd, that he was much oblig'd to
the <HI>Czar</HI> for the a&s;&s;urance of his good intentions,
and the &s;plendid Emba&s;&s;y he had &s;ent him.
And then M. <HI>Dankelman</HI> return'd an An&s;wer
more at large, and very obligingly to the Com|pliments
of the &s;everal Amba&s;&s;adors, who were
after that reconducted to their Lodgings with
the &s;ame Ceremonies, and treated with a &s;plen|did
Dinner at the Elector's Charge. The &s;ame
Evening they were al&s;o entertained with a
Shew of Fireworks which la&s;ted till Midnight.
Their Pre&s;ent con&s;i&s;ted of Sables, Ermins, and
other rich Furrs, &s;everal f$owered Silks and Ti&s;|&s;ues
of Gold and Silver; and other precious
Rarities, valu'd in all at Seventy Five Thou|&s;and
Crowns&endq;</P>
<P>DURING his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's &s;tay at this Court
he receiv'd the News by an Expre&s;s of the Electi|on
of the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> now King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI>
to the Crown of <HI>Poland;</HI> and as his Maje&s;ty had
before di&s;covered him&s;elf to be in the Intere&s;t of
that Party, which oppos'd the Prince of <HI>Conty</HI>'s
Election; &s;o upon this News he immediately &s;ent
<PB N="55" REF="56">
a Mini&s;ter to the new King, to make his Com|pliment
of Congratulation, and to declare pub|lickly,
that he would &s;upport his Preten&s;ions,
and would maintain him on the Throne with his
whole Power; and particularly, that he would
cau&s;e an Army of 60000 Men to march immedi|ately
to the Frontiers of <HI>Lithuania</HI> to be under his
Maje&s;ty's Orders, for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance in ca&s;e of
need.</P>
<P>ALL the while of the &s;tay of the Emba&s;&s;y, the
Elector of <HI>Brandenbourgh</HI> did every thing that was
po&s;&s;ible, as well to &s;hew his own Magnificence,
as to Honour the Emba&s;&s;y of &s;o great a Monarch;
and e&s;pecially con&s;idering that this Emba&s;&s;y, how|ever
glorious in it &s;elf to the Court of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> was
yet the more &s;o by the addition of this Article,
that the <HI>Czar,</HI> the greate&s;t Monarch of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI>
was there in Per&s;on, under the &s;helter of the Am|ba&s;&s;adors
his Servants.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had here &s;everal Occa&s;ions
to Conver&s;e intimately with the Elector, and
that with the greate&s;t Freedom and Openne&s;s;
communicating to him the Rea&s;on of his coming
thus out of his own Dominions, and pa&s;&s;ing
<HI>Incognito:</HI> I have been told that the Elector,
a Wi&s;e and Polite Prince, exceedingly approv'd
and applauded his Intentions,' and &s;aid &s;ome very
fine things both of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty in his Mi|ni&s;ter's
ordinary Di&s;cour&s;e, as well as per&s;onally
to him; and at the Conclu&s;ion, willingly entred
into a Defen&s;ive Treaty with his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's
Amba&s;&s;adors. In a word, the Elector omitted
nothing that could either te&s;tify his Affection to
the <HI>Czar</HI> in the mo&s;t obliging manner, or add any
A&s;&s;i&s;tance to him or his Retinue, cau&s;ing them to
be defray'd at his own Expence, not at <HI>Koning&s;|berg</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="57">
only, but all the while he was pa&s;&s;ing thro'
his Dominions.</P>
<P>FROM hence his Maje&s;ty went by Water thro'
the <HI>Pillau</HI> and the <HI>Frei&s;ch Haft,</HI> as it is call'd, to
<HI>Dantzick;</HI> the Elector ordering &s;ome Yachts to at|tend
his Maje&s;ty in the Pa&s;&s;age. This Water
call'd the <HI>Frei&s;ch Haft,</HI> is an Inland Lake or Wa|ter
which reaches from the <HI>Pillau</HI> near <HI>Koningsberg,</HI>
to a Branch of the great River <HI>Vi&s;tula,</HI> which
pa&s;&s;es by <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and by which Ve&s;&s;els pa&s;s
from <HI>Koningsberg</HI> to <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and is &s;eparated
from the Sea by a narrow Tract of Land not above
three Leagues over, which however lies parallel
with the &s;aid <HI>Haft,</HI> and entirely parts it from the
main Sea.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty took great Delight in &s;ail|ing
upon this Water, and in ob&s;erving the dex|trous
manner of the Seamens working the Yachts,
in turning to Windward, and the like; and he &s;pent
&s;ome Days on purpo&s;e to divert him&s;elf in that
Water with &s;ailing up and down, the Weather
al&s;o being very plea&s;ant and agreeable at that
time.</P>
<P>ABOUT the 20th he arriv'd at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> where
the Burghers and Magi&s;trates treated his Amba&s;&s;a|dors,
and that is to &s;ay his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf, with
all po&s;&s;ible Di&s;tinction, and cau&s;ed all the Forts,
Lines, Magazines, and Haven or Port, and every
part of the Fortifications of that great City to be
&s;hown him; which Fortifications far exceeded tho&s;e
of <HI>Riga,</HI> and which was very much to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty's Satisfaction. His Emba&s;&s;y made no
Entry here, being not directed to &s;ay any thing
to the Citizens as a Body, and as to their Sove|reign
the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> that Kingdom was at this
time as it were in an <HI>Interregnum,</HI> the late King
<PB N="57" REF="58">
<HI>John Sobieski</HI> being dead, and the new King <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI>
being but newly cho&s;en, and not yet
Crown'd.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Dantzick</HI> re|ceiv'd
&s;everal Te&s;timonies of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's
Favour, and to let them know how well he was
pleas'd with their Conduct, a&s;&s;ur'd them of his
Favour and Protection upon all Occa&s;ions; And
as his Emba&s;&s;y had been pre&s;ented with great
quantities of fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, Wines, and Refre&s;h|ments,
&s;o much as was almo&s;t &s;ufficient for their
whole Retinue; in return of this the <HI>Czar</HI> cau&s;ed
his Amba&s;&s;adors to make the Magi&s;trates a pre&s;ent
of Sables, and other rich Goods to a very con&s;ide|rable
Value.</P>
<P>FROM hence his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty went direct|ly
thro' the Ducal <HI>Pomerania</HI> to the City of <HI>Berlin,</HI>
the Court of the Elector of <HI>Brandenbourgh,</HI> where
he was Royally entertained and his whole Em|ba&s;&s;y
and Retinue: They made no Publick Entry
here, it being the Court of the &s;ame Prince who
had receiv'd them with &s;uch Splendor at <HI>Koning&s;|berg:</HI>
But the <HI>Czar</HI> had here the Occa&s;ion of &s;eeing
the mo&s;t &s;plendid Court in <HI>Europe,</HI> except that of
<HI>France,</HI> and to Conver&s;e in the mo&s;t Polite man|ner;
and was &s;o exceedingly pleas'd with the
Gallantry and Magnificence of all he &s;aw here,
that he re&s;olved to &s;end his Son the Hereditary
Royal Prince to re&s;ide there for &s;ome time to fi|ni&s;h
and poli&s;h his Manners for the great things
which they then &s;uppos'd him to be born to: But
time furni&s;hed the <HI>Czar</HI> with Rea&s;ons to take o|ther
Mea&s;ures, with re&s;pect to that Prince, of which
in its Order.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Berlin</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> bent his cour&s;e towards
the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> where his &s;olemn Emba&s;&s;y was
<PB N="58" REF="59">
principally de&s;ign'd to appear; and it is certain
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that is to &s;ay the <HI>States,</HI> had made it
much of their bu&s;ine&s;s to obtain this Honour;
intimating to the <HI>Czar</HI> their de&s;ire to form &s;uch
Treaties of Commerce and A&s;&s;i&s;tance as might
be for the mutual Profit of the Subjects of both
Nations; and particularly their Re&s;olution to
furni&s;h his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty with Workmen, Build|ers,
Shipwrights, and Trade&s;men of every kind,
nece&s;&s;ary for the Building of his Men of War;
and as they had obtain'd an a&s;&s;urance that his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty intended to Honour them with
his Pre&s;ence, and with his Emba&s;&s;y, &s;o they were
not wanting in all the nece&s;&s;ary Preparations, to
give him a Reception &s;uitable in &s;ome mea&s;ure to
the greatne&s;s of his Per&s;on and Character.</P>
<P>IT was not till the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> that the
Amba&s;&s;adors could &s;et their Foot in the Territo|ries
of the <HI>States General:</HI> For tho' my bu&s;ine&s;s is
to write of the <HI>Czar,</HI> and of him per&s;onally, yet
I mu&s;t be allowed to &s;peak here only in the
Name of the Emba&s;&s;y and of the Amba&s;&s;adors.
As &s;oon as the <HI>States General</HI> had notice of their
arrival upon their Frontiers, they &s;ent a &s;olemn
Deputation to attend them at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> from their
whole Body; for them, and in their Names, to
bid them welcome into their Country, to de|fray
all the Charges of the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adors
and their whole Retinue, to receive them at
the fir&s;t entrance into their Bounds, and to com|pliment
them accordingly.</P>
<P>THUS they were carried thro' all the Towns
with the noi&s;e of Cannon, and of &s;mall Arms on
the one hand, and with the Shouts and Acclama|tions
of the People on the other; the States being
willing to pre&s;erve the Memory of their being
<PB N="59" REF="60">
thus honoured by &s;o &s;olemn an Emba&s;&s;y, the mo&s;t
Glorious that had ever been &s;een in the&s;e Parts of
the World.</P>
<P>IT would be to omit the mo&s;t glorious Demon|&s;tration
of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Greatne&s;s, if I &s;hould fail
to give a full Account here as well of the said
Publick Entry, as of the great Ceremony of Au|dience
given the&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors afterwards at the
<HI>Hague,</HI> and al&s;o of the noble Appearance and
Deportment of the Amba&s;&s;adors them&s;elves; ne|ver
any Men from the Polite&s;t Nation under Hea|ven
behav'd better, or made their Speeches with
a better Grace, or better became the Character
they bore.</P>
<P>IT is certain the <HI>States-General,</HI> who, as I &s;aid
before, had earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd this Occa&s;ion of
&s;howing their Re&s;pect to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty,
intended to receive his Amba&s;&s;adors with great
Marks of Di&s;tinction, and e&s;pecially knowing that
the <HI>Czar</HI> was in Per&s;on with them: But they
found them&s;elves a little &s;urpriz'd when they
came to &s;ee the Amba&s;&s;adors them&s;elves; their
Per&s;ons, their Behaviour, and the perfect Know|ledge
they had of every thing that came before
them to Di&s;cour&s;e of; the Judgment they made
of the Intere&s;ts of Nations, and of the Advan|tages
of Commerce, the manner of extending it,
and of what was fit to propo&s;e or not to propo&s;e
in that part; and al&s;o the Judgment they were
able to make of their being well or ill treated;
&s;o that upon &s;eeing what &s;ort of Mini&s;ters they
had to do with, the States found it nece&s;&s;ary to
out-do, if po&s;&s;ible, what they had at fir&s;t intend|ed
in the Honours they de&s;ign'd them.</P>
<P>WE are to &s;uppo&s;e them now pa&s;s'd thro' the
<HI>Lower Saxony,</HI> and approaching the Frontiers of
<PB N="60" REF="61">
the States Country; the States Deputies gone to
meet and compliment them in the Name of the
Republick, and conducting them to <HI>Sourdam,</HI> near
the Capital City of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and to defray their
Charges upon the Way. The next thing is that
of their Publick Entry, which was the 26th of
<HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THE Magnificence of their Reception here
con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal parts, that is to &s;ay, not only
in their meer Entry into the City, which was in|deed
very fine, but in the Entertainment they
had there till the time they went to their Publick
Audience at the <HI>Hague;</HI> and al&s;o in the Recepti|on
they had at the &s;everal Cities which they pa&s;s'd
thro', as well before they came to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> as
when they went from thence to the <HI>Hague;</HI> in all
which it is to be ob&s;erved, that tho' the <HI>Czar</HI> was
a con&s;tant Eye-witne&s;s to the Reception of his
Amba&s;&s;adors, and had a great deal of Rea&s;on to
be very well &s;atisfied with the Honours they re|ceiv'd,
which indeed was no more or le&s;s than
Honours done to him&s;elf in the Per&s;ons of his
Servants; yet his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty keeping firm to
his fir&s;t Re&s;olutions of being conceal'd, and of not
appearing in Publick, was never &s;een in any of
the publick Cavalcades; but either went in the
Retinue conceal'd in the ordinary Dre&s;s of a pri|vate
Per&s;on, or had him&s;elf placed in &s;ome pri|vate
Station to be a Spectator of what pa&s;s'd, as we
&s;hall find he did at their Audience at the <HI>Hague;</HI>
and if he was at any time di&s;covered, as was on
Two or Three Occa&s;ions his ca&s;e, while he was in
<HI>Holland,</HI> nothing gave him more unea&s;ine&s;s, nor
would he leave till he found him&s;elf &s;o di&s;guis'd
$word$ to be able to go publickly about and not be
known.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="62">
THIS, and his de&s;ire to view the Yards, the
Docks, the building of Ships, and all the parti|cular
Operations of the Carpenters, Caulkers,
Anchor-&s;miths, Black-&s;miths, Rope-makers, and
&s;o of all the re&s;t, I &s;ay this, made him for &s;ome
time Dre&s;s him&s;elf in the ordinary Habit of a
common Seaman with a <HI>Monmouth</HI> Cap, a &s;hort
Jacket and wide Breeches, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible
to di&s;cover him; and in this Di&s;gui&s;e I have been
a&s;&s;ured, tho' I cannot affirm it of my own knowl|edge,
that he has &s;uffered him&s;elf to be hired in|to
their Carpenters Yards as a Workman, and has
both performed a Day's Work, and received his
Wages. But I &s;ay again, that I rather repeat this
from other hands, than &s;ay I believe it, or re|commend
it to others to believe.</P>
<P>BUT let that be as it will, certain it is, that
in this Di&s;gui&s;e he had a compleat liberty, with|out
the Interruption of the Crowding, and Curio|&s;ity
of the People to look at him; I &s;ay he had
the liberty of &s;eeing every thing that was done,
and al&s;o, <HI>which was the main thing to him,</HI> how it
was done.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Amba&s;&s;adors, the Depu|ties
&s;ent to receive them on the Borders of the
Country, having brought them to <HI>Sourdam,</HI> a
Town about Miles from <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> they
were lodg'd there till the Preparations could be
made for their Reception in the City, which was
done at the Charge of the Magi&s;trates; the Pro|ce&s;&s;ion
was in the following manner.</P>
<P>IN the Morning early Five Deputies from the
States of <HI>Holland,</HI> and Three from the City of
<HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> attended the Amba&s;&s;adors at <HI>Saurdam,</HI>
to Compliment them on their Arrival, and to In|vite
<PB N="62" REF="63">
them into the City; and the Yacht's of the
State were order'd to lye ready to attend them,
and take them on Board, with all their Retinue;
which was done accordingly, and they arriv'd at
the Place appointed for their Landing about ten
a$Clock.</P>
<P>A certain Number of the Magi&s;trates were
Deputed to attend them at their Landing, with
about fifty Coaches of the Burgoma&s;ters, and of
the Principal Citizens, and were to Complement
them on their Arrival. The Principal young Ci|tizens
form'd them&s;elves into a Troop, and being
well Mounted, and with extreamly rich Furni|ture
and Equipage, attended their Excellencies
Entry, being to the Number of near three Hun|dred
Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e the principal Citizens, and
all the Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction went to meet them
in their Coaches to a very great Number.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the Amba&s;&s;adors landed, and were
&s;eated in their Coaches, the Cannon from the
Ramparts fir'd round the whole City, and under
the Thunder of the &s;aid Guns the Cavalcade be|gan.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t Place march'd a Body of the City
Officers to clear the Way, and prevent Di&s;orders
from the infinite Throng of People in the Streets;
then march'd 16 Companies of the Burghers un|der
Arms, who when they came to the Place
appointed for them, form'd two Lines to Lin$e
the Street, thro' which the Amba&s;&s;ador and their
whole Retinue were to pa&s;s, other Bodies of the
Burghers under Arms, lin'd the re&s;t of the Way
to the Place where the 16 Companies took their
Po&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64">
NEXT to the&s;e came the Troop of young
Gentlemen on Hor&s;eback, very richly Dre&s;s'd,
and their Equipages <HI>as before</HI> very &s;plendid; and
before them went the States Trumpets, and City
Mu&s;ick; then came a &s;mall Troop of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian
Tartars</HI> on Hor&s;eback, being of the Amba&s;&s;adors,
Retinue, arm'd with Bows and Arrows; then &s;ix
and thirty <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Gentlemen on Hor&s;eback;
then twenty Pages of the Amba&s;&s;adors, clothed
in Scarlet lac'd, or rather overlaid with Gold
Lace; then came the elde&s;t Burgoma&s;ter's Coach
of State, in which were the Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>Le
Fort,</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Prince <HI>Me$$zike$$;</HI> then
the Grand Pen&s;ionary of <HI>Holland's</HI> Coach, in
which were the two other Amba&s;&s;adors, and another
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Prince: On either &s;ide the&s;e Coaches,
march'd the Amba&s;&s;ador's Guard, on Foot, carry|ing
&s;ilver Battle-Axes, and by their Sides large
Scymetars; they were Clothed after the <HI>Sclavo|nian</HI>
manner, with &s;hort Doublets, and large
Breeches, and over them Scarlet Cloaks, or Robes
trim'd with &s;ilver Buttons, and large Loops, and
Scarlet lac'd with Silver very rich: After the&s;e,
came the re&s;t of the Coaches mention'd above, in
which were the re&s;t of the Amba&s;&s;adors Retinue;
among them the <HI>Czar</HI> him&s;elf, but Dre&s;s'd in an
ordinary Habit, &s;o as not be di&s;tingui&s;h'd; nei|ther
was it po&s;&s;ible to Di&s;cover him, tho' the
People were mighty inqui&s;itive about it.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e Coaches came 120 Coaches of
Citizens, Merchants and Gentlemen, who came
to wait upon the Amba&s;&s;adors; and among the&s;e
were the Magi&s;trates of the City; the whole
Clo&s;ing with another Body of Burghers in
Arms. But the Magi&s;trates did not End here,
<PB N="64" REF="65">
for after having thus Conducted the Amba&s;&s;adors
to their Appartments, they treated them in the
mo&s;t Magnificent manner immaginable, for five
Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and thus prepar'd a mo&s;t ex|traordinary
Firework, rai&s;ed upon Floats, built
on purpo&s;e in the Water of the <HI>Am&s;tel.</HI> It would
take up too much Room in this Work, to give
the De&s;cription of this Firework, which was
fram'd in the mo&s;t Exqui&s;ite manner, that the
be&s;t Engineers and Architects could Invent; nor
was any Co&s;t &s;par'd in either, the Device or the
Building. In a Word, it was the mo&s;t Magnifi|cent
that ever was &s;een in the&s;e Parts of the
World, and his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was exceedingly
pleas'd with it, as he had a great deal of Rea&s;on
to be; for it was Executed with all immaginable
in Order and Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is true, this Sight was attended with an un|happy
Accident among the People, for that the
Railes of the Bridge over the River, being Crow|ded
with People, gave way, and above 100 Peo|ple
fell into the River, where about thirteen or
fourteen were Drown'd; and indeed it was a great
Wonder the Night being dark and the Water
deep and the Crowd &s;o great, that there were not
more lo&s;t.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was now in the Center
of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and had before him the main
Thing he came to &s;ee; and therefore &s;hunning
all publick Appearances, other than tho&s;e which
Nece&s;&s;ity oblig'd him to, he took a &s;mall Hou&s;e,
near the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Companies Yards or Docks,
that is to &s;ay, among the Shipwrights and Buil|ders,
and where he could with ea&s;e get Admit|tance
in Digui&s;e, to &s;ee every thing which he
<PB N="65" REF="66">
thought fit to Enquire after, and to take his Ob|&s;ervations
at his own Lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>IT is true, he was oblig'd to go from thence
for &s;ometime to the <HI>Hague,</HI> to &s;ee his Amba&s;&s;adors
admitted to a publick Audience of their High
Mightine&s;&s;es the States General; but he &s;oon re|turn'd
again and remain'd perfectly retir'd for
&s;ome Months, where he &s;pent his Time in the
mo&s;t u&s;eful Studies of Life (<HI>viz.</HI>) the gaining true
Ideas of the mo&s;t noble Things, and &s;earching the
height and depth of Mathematical Knowledge.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have ob&s;erv'd here that the <HI>Czar</HI> him|&s;elf
having receiv'd the Deputies on the Fron|tiers
of <HI>Guelderland,</HI> and being de&s;irous to Tra|vel,
perfectly undi&s;cover'd, left his Amba&s;&s;adors
and their Train, which was very great, to come
lei&s;urely forward with the &s;aid Deputies&punc; and
him&s;elf with only four or five Gentlemen di&s;guis'd
as ordinary Travellers, came to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> four
or five Days before them, where he Lodg'd at fir&s;t
in a common Inn, or Hou&s;e of Entertainment,
and walk'd freely about the City, view'd the Situa|tion,
the Buildings, the River, the Port, and that
infinite Number of Ships, which always are to
be &s;een there; particularly he pitch'd upon the
Place for his Retreat, or private Re&s;idence, which as
I have mention'd above was among the Ship-Yards,
Docks and Building-Places, that he might parti|cularly
make his Ob&s;ervations of tho&s;e things;
The enquiry after which was his Delight, and
the e&s;pecial Bu&s;ine&s;s of his whole Emba&s;&s;y.</P>
<P>THE Ceremony ended as above, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty retir'd to the Hou&s;e which he had Hir'd,
and went on with his Equipage and Ob&s;ervations;
and as he &s;poke Dutch indifferently well before, &s;o
he took occa&s;ion to Di&s;cour&s;e with all the Work|men
<PB N="66" REF="67">
and Arti&s;ts that he could find, who he di&s;co|vered
to have any tollerable Judgement in things
of that Nature. Nor was his Maje&s;ty &s;o retir'd,
but that he admitted &s;ome of the Merchants of
<HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> to his Conver&s;ation, and e&s;pecially
&s;uch as had re&s;ided in <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> that is to &s;ay at
<HI>Arch-Angel</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> of which &s;everal were
then living in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and with the&s;e he would
be very free and Courteous, and &s;ometimes <HI>even
Merry</HI> only not allowing them to Treat him with
too much Ceremony and Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>BY the Conver&s;ation of the&s;e Men he had &s;everal
People brought to him, who were mo&s;t
Ma&s;ters of Science, and who entertain'd his Ma|je&s;ty
very much to his Satisfaction, with the &s;e|veral
Experiments in Nature, in Phylo&s;ophy, and
in the Mathematicks, which they had made in the
Con&s;equence of long Study; and it was to their
Aftoni&s;hment how &s;oon, and how readily his <HI>Cza|ri&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty took in the ju&s;t Ideas, which their Di&s;|coveries,
and Experiments pre&s;ented, and how
knowingly he would Di&s;cour&s;e, even of tho&s;e
things, which he had received no Notion of before.</P>
<P>THE Deputies of the Admiralty al&s;o &s;hew'd their
re&s;pect to his Maje&s;ty, in cau&s;ing every thing that
was curious, relating to Naval Affairs to be &s;hew|ed
him, and Arti&s;ts of all kinds to be pre&s;ented to
him.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the publick Audience of his
Amba&s;&s;adors call'd him away to the <HI>Hague,</HI> where
he had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing their High-Migh|tine&s;&s;es
the States General do him the utmo&s;t
Honour in the Per&s;ons of his Amba&s;&s;adors, and
even to out do them&s;elves, no Audience having e|ver
been known like it in that Country.</P>
<P>IT would be tire&s;ome to relate the Magnifi|cence
of their Reception all the way from <HI>Am|&s;terdam</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="68">
to the <HI>Hague,</HI> whether they and all their
Retinue went the latter End of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty al&s;o having Intimation of
the great Preparations the <HI>States-General</HI> made for
the Reception of his Emba&s;&s;y, and for Gracing
their Audience, re&s;olv'd to make a &s;uitable pre|paration
for it on his Side; and therefore cau&s;ed
his Amba&s;&s;ador to make three of the mo&s;t Mag|nificent
Coaches that could be made for Money,
and order'd them to buy Jewels likewi&s;e, and
Cloths the Riche&s;t that could be had, to en|crea&s;e
their Retinue with about Forty more Ser|vants,
and to Cloth them and all the re&s;t in new
Liveries quite different from tho&s;e they had be|fore;
in a Word, he directed that every thing
&s;hould appear in the greate&s;t &s;plendor po&s;&s;ible;
&s;o that 'tis &s;aid the Expence co&s;t above 200000
Dollars extraordinary.</P>
<P>ALL things being ready, and the Audience ap|pointed,
they &s;et out from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> the 24th of
<HI>September,</HI> and arriv'd at the <HI>Hague</HI> the &s;ame Day.</P>
<P>THEIR publick Entry was infinitely Superi|or
to that at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> this being at the Ap|pointment
of the <HI>States-General,</HI> the other only a
Reception of them by the Citizens and Magi|&s;trates
of <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> and yet the particulars of
this part were not &s;o publickly &s;et down as the o|ther,
what I have met with amounts to this.</P>
<P>THAT the Amba&s;&s;adors were receiv'd at a di|&s;tance
from the <HI>Hague,</HI> where they had gone on
purpo&s;e for the Occa&s;sion, by five Deputies of the
<HI>States-General</HI> as Introductors of Amba&s;&s;adors:
They were attended by the Reigment of Hor&s;e-Guards,
and two Battalions of the Guards of
Foot, call'd the Blew Guards; with two Coaches
of State, drawn by eight Hor&s;es each, for the Am|ba&s;&s;adors,
<PB N="68" REF="69">
and forty other Coaches with &s;ix Hor&s;es
each, for their Retinue.</P>
<P>THE Amba&s;&s;adors were preceeded by forty
Gentlemen on Hor&s;eback, habited as <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI>
arm'd with Bows and Arrows, and thirty others as
<HI>Tartars,</HI> arm'd with Lances and Bows; all exceed|ing
richly Cloth'd, but after the manner of their
own Countries: They had forty Pages in different
Livery, but all cover'd with Gold and Silver Lace
as rich as po&s;&s;ible. Their immediate Guard were
as at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> Habited after the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
manner, carrying &s;ilver Battle-Axes in their
Hands, and Symetars with &s;ilver Hilts by their
Sides.</P>
<P>THE Amba&s;&s;adors were in two Coaches of
State, and their own new magnificent Coaches
follow'd, having Thirty two Footmen in rich Li|veries
walking on the Sides.</P>
<P>THE whole was follow'd with a numerous
Train of Coaches belonging to the Nobility and
Gentry, and to the foreign Mini&s;ters, of which
there are always a great many at the <HI>Hague,</HI> but
more e&s;pecially at that Juncture, it being the time
of that <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> for the Peace with <HI>France,</HI> call'd
afterwards the Treaty at <HI>Ry&s;wick.</HI></P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was in the Train in Di&s;|gui&s;e,
wearing a plain blew Coat, a large white

his Coach, and de&s;ir'd him to Accompany him

IT was in the Month of <HI>September</HI> of the &s;aid
Year, when there was the greate&s;t &s;how of foreign
Amba&s;&s;adors that ever was &s;een at the <HI>Hague,</HI> oc|ca&s;ion'd
by the Negotiation, <HI>as above,</HI> at <HI>Ry&s;wick:</HI>
Thither mo&s;t Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> had &s;ent their
Plenipotentiaries, who all &s;triving to out vie
one another in Magnificence. It was no ea&s;ie Mat|ter
to add any thing to the Splendor of their Equi|pages;
yet his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty being &s;en&s;ible that
the Eyes of the World in a mo&s;t peculiar manner
would be fix'd upon his Emba&s;&s;y; and being in|vited
by a mo&s;t commendabl$ emulation to main|tain,
as well on that as other Occa&s;ions the glory
and lu&s;tre of his eminent Station in the World,
as claiming the Title of an Emperor, and bearing
the Imperial Arms; he was fully re&s;olv'd that
this mo&s;t &s;olemn Emba&s;&s;y, honour'd by his Pre|&s;ence
&s;hould bear the Marks of, and be fully an|&s;werable
to his high Station and Grandeur.</P>
<P>In effect according to the Te&s;timony of all that
were Spectators of this &s;olemn Audience, every thing
was manag'd with &s;o much order, maje&s;ty and gra|vity,
and with &s;o much Magnificence, that nothing
could add to the Lu&s;tre of this Solemnity, which
in all Re&s;pects was &s;uitable to his Maje&s;ty's De|sign.</P>
<P>IT is confe&s;s'd by all Hands that never any
Amba&s;&s;ador appear'd in a more &s;plendid Attire
then the General <HI>le Fort</HI> the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador did
that Day; he was clad after the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Fa&s;hi|on,
in a long Robe of Cloth of Gold, lin'd with
the mo&s;t precious Sables that ever were &s;een. This
Robe as well as the Ve&s;t which he wore under it,
was cover'd before with Diamonds in the Shape
of a Hern's feather, with &s;uch Lu&s;ter as dazl'dthe
Eyes of the Beholders; he Harang'd their High and
<PB N="70" REF="71">
Mightine&s;&s;es in the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Tongue, with an Air
altogether Maje&s;tick, and &s;uitable to the Cha|racter
he bore upon &s;o &s;olemn an Occa&s;ion. The
two other Amba&s;&s;adors, who appeared likewi&s;e in
very rich Apparel, made al&s;o their Compliments
to their High and Mightine&s;&s;es with a Maje&s;tick
Gravity; but that which added the greate&s;t Lu&s;tre
to the Audience, was, that all the Amba&s;&s;adors of
mo&s;t Princes in <HI>Europe,</HI> honoured the&s;e Men with
their Pre&s;ence; and his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had the
&s;atisfaction to be an Eye-witne&s;s of all that pa&s;|&s;ed
from a Clo&s;et Window opening into the Au|dience
Room, without being perceived by any
Body; and returned the next Day privately to
<HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> extremely well plea&s;ed with his Jour|ney;
neither did their Excellencies make any long
&s;tay in the <HI>Hague,</HI> they having no other matters
to propo&s;e to the States, but the confirming of
former Treaties.</P>
<P>THE Ceremonies now ended, the <HI>Czar</HI> not on|ly
applyed him&s;elf to the Work he came about
as before, but all the Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction which
he brought with him, di&s;pers'd them&s;elves according
to the different Commands he gave them; ap|plying
them&s;elves according as their different In|clinations
led them, to the Knowledge of &s;uch
things as were needful, according to the Pattern
of their great Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>THIS le&s;&s;ened the Retinue which at fir&s;t ap|peared
in the Emba&s;&s;y exceedingly; and yet the
Amba&s;&s;adors retain'd an Equipage &s;uitable to the
Character they bore, and &s;uitable to the Glory of
their Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the <HI>Czar</HI> receiv'd an invita|tion
very agreeable to him, which was to have an
Interview with the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> at that
<PB N="71" REF="72">
time, the Glory of that part of the World, and
who had ju&s;t fini&s;hed, with Honour to him&s;elf,
and Satisfaction to all his Allies, a long and bloody
War with the King of <HI>France</HI> by the Treaty at
<HI>Ry&s;wick.</HI></P>
<P>THE King came to <HI>Utrecht,</HI> where the <HI>Czar,</HI>
accompanied only with Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> and Ge|neral
<HI>Le Fort,</HI> but all <HI>Incognito,</HI> went to &s;ee him;
the&s;e two mighty Monarchs receiv'd a mutual Sa|tisfaction
in this interview, as both of them af|terwards
te&s;tified: They continued &s;ome Hours to|gether,
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Le Fort</HI> &s;erving as an Interpre|ter;
and here it was that his <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty in|vited
the <HI>Czar</HI> to come and &s;ee his Court at <HI>Lon|don;</HI>
and that his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty accepted the
King's invitation, of which by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty now having his full lei&s;ure for
the perfecting what he came about, he hir'd Ar|ti&s;ts
in <HI>Holland</HI> of &s;everal &s;orts, and giving them
very good Conditions, di&s;patch'd them for <HI>Mu&s;|cow,</HI>
&s;ome by Land, the Sea&s;on not admitting to
go about by the North Cape to <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI> and
&s;ome were maintain'd and employ'd in making
Models and Draughts for Building, 'till the Sea|&s;on
for going by Sea came on: In this manner they
were di&s;pers'd many ways, &s;ome went to Schools or
Ma&s;ters to learn Navigation and the Elements of
<HI>Euclid;</HI> others Bound them&s;elves for terms of Years
to Artificers; in a word, none were Idle, the
<HI>Czar</HI> re&s;olving to furni&s;h him&s;elf and all his At|tendants
with a Fund of Knowledge &s;ufficient to
an&s;wer his End; and indeed con&s;idering his Ma|je&s;ty's
View, it was a very great Fund of Human
Learning that ought to be laid up, to carry home
and in&s;truct a Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73">
IT was an immen&s;e Sum of Money that his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty laid out here in buying Tools
and In&s;truments for the Works, and &s;everal Trades
and Arts which he and his People were to put in
Practi&s;e; there was not a Handicraft of any Note,
that his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty did not acquaint him&s;elf
more or le&s;s with, and with the manner of their
Working, no not from the making of a Watch to the
builder of a Ship; but it is to be noted, that the Ma|rine
Affairs were tho&s;e his chief Delight was in, and
which &s;uited be&s;t with his Genius; and while he
was at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> he bought him a Yacht, with
which he diverted him&s;elf continually upon the
River and the <HI>Zuyderzee,</HI> till by Cu&s;tom he learnt
to &s;teer and work her as dexterou&s;ly as the able&s;t
Seamen he could get.</P>
<P>HERE he al&s;o hir'd &s;everal Seamen and Offi|cers,
and made them Captains and Lieutenants
of his Men of War, &s;ome of whom are in his Ser|vice
to this Day.</P>
<P>ABOUT the of <HI>Septemb.</HI> 1698, he re|&s;olv'd
upon his Journey, or Voyage rather, to
<HI>England,</HI> and accordingly he arriv'd here in <HI>No|vember</HI>
1698, of which pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hould have noted here, that while his
Maje&s;ty remain'd at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> after he had been
at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and was return'd as above, he re|ceiv'd
three Couriers from his Lords, to whom he
had left the Admini&s;tration of the Government at
<HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> in his ab&s;ence; bringing him the welcome
News of a great Victory obtain'd by his Army
under the Command of General <HI>Schein</HI> at <HI>A&s;oph</HI>
over the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI> The Particulars of
this Action, as they were then related, were as
follows, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">
HIS Maje&s;ty fir&s;t receiv'd an Expre&s;s from
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> with the agreeable News of this Bat|tel;
the other Accounts came &s;ome time after
by different ways: The <HI>Cham</HI> of the <HI>Crim Tar|tars</HI>
had, in the beginning of the Spring,
cau&s;ed great numbers of his Troops to pa&s;s in
many &s;mall Bodies, and at different times,
through <HI>Caffa,</HI> in order to join them with the
<HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia,</HI> and e&s;pecially tho&s;e inha|biting
near the River <HI>Cubanoc,</HI> knowing that the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Army was divided into &s;everal Bodies,
the better to cover the Workmen, who were em|ploy'd
in &s;everal places, in compleating the be|fore-mentioned
Fortifications, looking upon this
as a fit opportunity to &s;urprize them unawares:
For this purpo&s;e he order'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> com|manded
by <HI>Sultan Galga,</HI> to advance with great
and <HI>&s;peedy</HI> Marches towards the <HI>Mu&s;covites:</HI> But
the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> General <HI>Schein</HI> having received intel|ligence
of their approach, had ju&s;t &s;o much lei|&s;ure
given him as to draw down his Troops toge|ther
in an advantageous Place, where he re&s;olv'd
to engage the Enemy; the&s;e perceiving them|&s;elves
&s;uperior in number to the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and
being encourag'd by the fancy'd fear of the <HI>Mu&s;|covite</HI>
Army, which did not move from their
Po&s;t, fell with great Fury upon them, and were
received with great Bravery by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> who
were contented to defend them&s;elves in their Po&s;t,
till their General perceiving the fir&s;t heat of the
<HI>Tarters</HI> &s;lacken, attacked them very briskly, put
them fir&s;t into Confu&s;ion, and &s;oon after to the
Rout, with a great Slaughter on the Enemy's
&s;ide, whom they pur&s;ued to the River <HI>Hagalinc,</HI>
were many of them were drown'd; this River
runs through <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia,</HI> about two Leagues di&s;tant
<PB N="74" REF="75">
from <HI>A&s;oph;</HI> tho' our Maps put this River to the
North on the other &s;ide of the River <HI>Don,</HI> above
thirty Leagues from <HI>A&s;oph.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR Excellencies the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dors
made Publick Rejoicings upon this Occa&s;ion,
and invited the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and o|ther
Per&s;ons of Quality to a magnificent Enter|tainment,
where they were diverted with Dancing
and Mu&s;ick, Fireworks, and all &s;orts of other Di|verti&s;ements:
His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was pleas'd to
appear there in Per&s;on, and in &s;o plea&s;ant a Hu|mour,
all the Gue&s;s were extreamly &s;atisfy'd
with his Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>TOWARD the end of the Winter this Victory
was &s;econded by the News of another Advantage
obtain'd near the River <HI>Bori&s;thenes;</HI> for the <HI>Crim
Tartars,</HI> in Conjunction with tho&s;e of <HI>Budziack</HI>
and <HI>Oczakow,</HI> having be&s;ieged <HI>Ka&s;ikermeen,</HI> had
carried on their Trenches to the very Counter|&s;carp,
and at the &s;ame time made them&s;elves
Ma&s;ters of the adjacent &s;mall I&s;le of <HI>Tomam;</HI> but
a Body of <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> having joined the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> in|habiting
tho&s;e Frontiers, came time enough to the
Relief of the place, forcing the <HI>Tartars</HI> to aban|don
the Siege, and that with a con&s;iderable Lo&s;s
on their &s;ide; upon which his Maje&s;ty gave or|ders,
that the &s;aid I&s;land &s;hould be &s;trengthened
by &s;ome regular Fortifications.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e Succe&s;&s;es added to his Maje&s;ty's
Glory; and the more, in that they were obtain'd
in his Ab&s;ence, as it was a Te&s;timony that the
Government of his Affairs was left in good Hands,
and that he had made a right Choice of his Men,
with whom he had entru&s;ted the Command of his
Armies, as well as of tho&s;e to whom he had com|mitted
<PB N="75" REF="76">
the Admini&s;tration of his Civil Govern|ment.</P>
<P>THESE Advices were follow'd with other
Letters, giving him an Account of the progre&s;s
of his Engineers, and how well they had &s;ecur'd
and fortify'd the Places he had won; as well <HI>A|&s;oph</HI>
as <HI>Tuba, Kai&s;ikermeen,</HI> and other Places; and
that the fir&s;t of the&s;e <HI>e&s;pecially,</HI> was put into &s;uch
a Po&s;ture that it might ju&s;tly be e&s;teemed one of
the &s;tronge&s;t Fortre&s;&s;es of the World, particularly
that part which he had directed to be built in the
Mora&s;s mention'd above.</P>
<P>THIS was the more agreeable to the <HI>Czar,</HI> as
it was &s;uitable to his wi&s;h, for that in a Word,
<HI>A&s;oph</HI> was the Center of all his va&s;t De&s;igns, and
he had as we may &s;ay, laid no le&s;s than a Scheme
for the Ruin of the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire in the
Gradations he had Projected from that one Place,
as will be &s;een hereafter.</P>
<P>WE are now to &s;uppo&s;e his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty on
his Voyage to <HI>England,</HI> his <HI>Britanick</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;ent
over &s;everal Yatches to bring him over with a
Man of War, or two for his Convoy, and he arriv'd
in the River of <HI>Thames</HI> the of <HI>October.</HI> 1697.</P>
<P>WHEN he came to <HI>London,</HI> the King omitted
nothing to &s;how him that he had a very particular
e&s;teem for him; indeed the Intent and Meaning
of his thus hazarding his Per&s;on in foreign Parts
for enabling him&s;elf to Government, and People
was a thing &s;o inimitably great, and &s;o prai&s;e
worthy in a Prince of his Rank, that it merited
all the regard, and all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance that could
po&s;&s;ibly be given him.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="77">
HIS <HI>Britanick</HI> Maje&s;ty at fir&s;t offer'd the <HI>Czar</HI>
all the publick Honour due to his Character as a
Royal or Imperial Soveraign and Crown'd Head;
as particularly, his Maje&s;ty offer'd him <HI>Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e</HI>
for his Re&s;idence, being a Pallace Royal,
and that he &s;hould be attended by the Officers of
the Royal Hou&s;hold, and that all the Expence of
his Kitchin, and of his Retinue &s;hould be de|frayed;
that he &s;hould have a Detachment of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hou&s;hold Troops for a Guard to his Per|&s;on,
and a certain Number of the King's Coaches
to attend him.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Czar</HI> after returning a very obliging
An&s;wer, declin'd all tho&s;e Honours; let his Ma|je&s;ty
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> know the Rea&s;ons of his
Re&s;olution to be every where Incognito, and
how nece&s;&s;ary it was to his De&s;ign in coming a|broad;
that he came for Improvement, and had
no time to &s;pend in Ceremony, receiving and
returning Vi&s;its, and the like.</P>
<P>HE therefore de&s;ir'd his <HI>Britanick Maje&s;ty</HI> that
he would &s;uffer him to be as much conceal'd
as po&s;&s;ible, and yet that he might have &s;o much
of his Royal favour, as &s;hould admit him to &s;ee
what was proper for his Improvement in Maritime
Affairs, which was the principle thing that he
de&s;ir'd to In&s;pect, and which he found here was
manag'd even in a greater Perfection than in any
other part of the World.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Britanick</HI> Maje&s;ty was &s;o extreamly
pleas'd with this, and with all the other Te&s;ti|monies,
which the <HI>Czar</HI> gave of his Per&s;onal
Capacities, and his Genius to the things he came
to enquire after; and particularly, the truly no|ble
End and De&s;ign of his enquiring after them;
that he immediately order'd that all po&s;&s;ible En|couragement,
<PB N="77" REF="78">
and A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be given his
Maje&s;ty; that he &s;hould be &s;howed every thing that
he had a de&s;ire to &s;ee, and that all the Men of
Art &s;hould communicate every thing that his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;hould de&s;ire to know: In a
Word, his <HI>Britanick</HI> Maje&s;ty let him know that
nothing &s;hould be wanting in <HI>England</HI> to give all
po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;i&s;tance to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty in &s;o
glorious a Search after Knowledge, and Wi&s;dom,
and that he would do every thing that was in his
power to let him (the <HI>Czar</HI>) &s;ee what e&s;teem he
(the King) had for him on that particular Ac|count.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty after his letting the King
know his Re&s;olution of remaining Private, took
a Hou&s;e, as proper, and as happily Situated for
&s;uch a purpo&s;e, as the whole City could hardly have
afforded &s;uch another, con&s;idering its being a well
built commodious Hou&s;e al&s;o; for as it had a good
front Gate to bring a Coach to, in the <HI>Great-Row,</HI>
of <HI>Norfolk-&s;treet,</HI> in the <HI>Strand;</HI> &s;o it had a pri|vate
pair of Stairs to the River, peculiar to the
Hou&s;e only; where Boats could come even at low
Water to &s;et him on &s;hore, or take him in, as he
thought fit, and &s;o that it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to
the People to &s;ee him go or come.</P>
<P>WHILE he re&s;ided here, he had frequent In|terviews
with the King, and made &s;ome Vi&s;its
to the Prince&s;s <HI>Ann,</HI> afterwards Queen; went to
&s;ee <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Ca&s;tle, <HI>Hampton</HI> Court, and other
publick Places; was particularly &s;hew'd the <HI>Tower</HI>
of <HI>London,</HI> and all the Varieties there, where he
was particularly taken with the Great Armory,
and the admirable Order of the placeing
the &s;mall Arms, and Furniture for Hor&s;e and
Foot; and ep&s;ecially the keeping the Arms &s;o
<PB N="78" REF="79">
clean, well fix'd, and ready for Service; and, as
we hear, has appointed one to be Built after the
&s;ame manner at <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> and to be furni&s;h'd
with &s;mall Arms for an Hundred Thou&s;and
Men.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time he was accommodated at
<HI>Deptford</HI> with an Apartment which had a private
Door into the King's Yard and Wet Dock, and
a way al&s;o into the Merchant's Yards and Wet
Docks, on the way from <HI>Deptford</HI> to <HI>Redriff;</HI> by
which he had opportunity to &s;ee every part of the
Builders Art exemplifyed; and which was mo&s;t
delightful to his Maje&s;ty, the Ma&s;ter Builders
having expre&s;s, Orders to oblige his Maje&s;ty as
much as po&s;&s;ible, laid before him their Moulds
and Draughts, and the accurate Method by which
they fitted every piece of Timber, and directed
the building of the large&s;t Ships of War.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was &s;o extremely pleas'd
with that part, whether it was that their Method
was not &s;o good in <HI>Holland,</HI> or that they did not
let him &s;o far into the Secret of their Art, I know
not; but he was pleas'd to declare, that our
Building far exceeded all that he had &s;een before,
and that he was re&s;olv'd to make the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men
of War be the Pattern by which all his own Ships
&s;hould be built, and to have his Builders in&s;truct|ed
to work their Models the &s;ame way; and I am
informed, he made him&s;elf &s;o much Ma&s;ter of
the Method, that he has &s;ince drawn the fir&s;t
Draught of his large&s;t Men of War with his own
Hand.</P>
<P>AFTER this his Maje&s;ty the King of <HI>Great
Britain</HI> ordered Admiral <HI>Mitchel</HI> to go down to
<HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> where there then lay a Squadron of
Men of War, and caus'd them to be form'd into
<PB N="79" REF="80">
two Fleets, and to &s;how the <HI>Czar</HI> the manner of
an Engagement at Sea, making them draw out
and Engage, tho' without firing with Ball.</P>
<P>HERE his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty being on board the
Admiral's Ship, was &s;hewed the manner of two
Fleet's preparing to Fight, their Unmooring, their
Scouts giving Signal to the Fleet, the Admiral
giving Signal to draw up in a Line, and when to
engage; their &s;triving for the Weather-gage, bear|ing
down upon the Enemy, &s;tanding off and on to
keep out of the Fight, keeping the Line, putting
off of Fire&s;hips, and attacking with Fire&s;hips;
firing Broad&s;ides, clapping one another aboard,
lying thwart Haw&s;e, coming up under the Stern,
and pouring in Broad&s;ides upon a Ship's Quarter
or Bow, and in &s;hort, all the ways of taking Ad|vantage
of an Enemy in Fight.</P>
<P>THIS was perform'd with &s;o much Order, &s;o
Dexterou&s;ly, and &s;o without the lea&s;t Dammage,
that his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty profe&s;s'd him&s;elf exceed|ing
well pleas'd with it; and that much more than
he was with &s;omething of the &s;ame kind offered
him in <HI>Holland,</HI> which being performed al&s;o by
&s;maller Ve&s;&s;els, could not &s;o well explain the Par|ticulars
nece&s;&s;ary to be known for the ordering a
Sea-fight with Capital Ships.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Czar</HI> employ'd his time in <HI>England,</HI>
viewing every thing that was Curious, and enter|ing
into due Enquiries after tho&s;e things, which
he found mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for his Purpo&s;e, as parti|cularly,
be&s;ides what I have mentioned above, he
was very curious in his viewing the Mint, and
E&s;&s;aying the Metals, reducing them to the Stan|dard
Value, the Melting-hou&s;e, the Flatting Mill,
the Stamping, and the Dye, or Stamp which
makes the Impre&s;&s;ion. Likewi&s;e he went to the

Lords, in their own Country Habit, and
others after the <HI>French</HI> dre&s;s; after the&s;e came
fifty Burghers, clad in black Velvet, bearing the
Pre&s;ents de&s;ign'd for his Imperial Maje&s;ty, which
con&s;i&s;ted in a great Number of lovely Ermins
and Furs, Sables, Cloath of Gold and Silver,

a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> a Hor&s;eback, carrying the Letters of
Credence, follow'd by one of the Emperor's
Coaches; wherein the Emba&s;&s;adors rode, together
with his Imperial Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ioners. This
Coach was &s;urrounded and attended by Pages and
other in Liveries belonging as well to the Amba&s;|&s;adors

Amba&s;&s;adors Coaches clos'd the March; the Am|ba&s;&s;adors
entering into the Court of the Palace
<HI>de le Favorite</HI> found the Guards in Arms, and were
conducted to the Hall of Audience, with the ac|cu&s;tom'd
Ceremonies, after which they were mag|nificently
Treated at the Emperors Charges, and &s;o
Conducted back to the Place where they lay.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> was ju&s;t upon his departure for <HI>Ve|nice,</HI>
in his way to <HI>Rome,</HI> and had already &s;ent
eight Per&s;ons of his Train before, but at the very
time he was preparing to depart; he was con|&s;train'd
to alter his Re&s;olution, and to take Po&s;t
for <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> with a Train of between thirty and
<PB N="87" REF="88">
forty Hor&s;e, upon Advice of a revolt of &s;everal

put a &s;top to the Current of the Commotion, he
might unhappily find all the Pa&s;&s;ages &s;top'd.</P>
<P>WE are now come to the End of this unexam|pled
Journey, <HI>viz.</HI> the Travels of the <HI>Czar,</HI> and his
Amba&s;&s;adors, in a Circle of near 2000 Miles, not in|cluding
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Trip to <HI>England:</HI> It
is now time to look back to <HI>Mu&s;covy:</HI> His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty had received &s;everal Expre&s;&s;es from his
Generals at <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> of their &s;ucce&s;sful Encounters
with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and ju&s;t before he left the
<HI>Hague,</HI> where his Amba&s;&s;adors had their Audience
of leave, there arriv'd another Courier with an
Account, that General <HI>Gordon</HI> had very happily
&s;uppre&s;s'd a kind of an In&s;urrection of 10000 of
the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> and had kill'd 3500 of them upon
the Spot, and taken almo&s;t all the re&s;t of them
Pri&s;oners; that he had Decimated the Pri&s;oners, and
hang'd every Tenth Man upon the Field of Bat|tle,
had retain'd in Pri&s;on the re&s;t, with &s;e|veral
of their Ringleaders, and &s;ome of the No|bility
who had Fomented their in&s;olence, and in a
Word, had effectually &s;uppre&s;s'd the Rebellion.</P>
<P>IN the Neck of this came another from <HI>A&s;oph,</HI>
with the News, that a Detachment of 8000 Men
from the Gari&s;on of that City had defeated 6000
<HI>Tartars,</HI> who had been Po&s;ted as a Guard to the
<HI>Tartar's</HI> Hor&s;es, who were put into the Mar&s;hes
on the Frontiers of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia,</HI> and had taken no
le&s;s than 30000 Hor&s;es of which mention is made,
as above.</P>
<P>BUT all the&s;e good Tidings had their Allay,
and the la&s;t News his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty receivd,
was &s;uch as intimated the Danger to be very
<PB N="88" REF="89">
great, and that they fear'd a general In&s;urrection,
entreating him to ha&s;ten back, not only that by his
Pre&s;ence he might encourage his faithful Subjects,
but that he might arrive before the Con&s;pirators
&s;hould be able to get a Force together, and &s;eize
upon the Pa&s;&s;es, and Entrances into his Country,
and either make it impracticable for him to return,
or perhaps make him run the Danger of falling
into the Hands of his Enemies in the attempt.</P>
<P>It will ea&s;ily be granted that his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty
had Rea&s;on to u&s;e the utmo&s;t Expedition
in his Return, and indeed upon that Expedition
depended his &s;ucce&s;s; for the celerity or &s;wiftne&s;s
of his Return was &s;uch, that the Con&s;pirators &s;aw
him in the Ca&s;tle or Pallace of <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> &s;ur|rounded
with his Army, and ready to fall upon
them before they thought it had been po&s;&s;ible
that he could &s;o much as have any Account of
their proceedings.</P>
<P>THIS was &s;uch a &s;urprize to them as broke all
their Mea&s;ures; for the <HI>Czar</HI> fell to work with
them, the very Moment he arrived, and particu|larly
with tho&s;e who General <HI>Gordon</HI> had in Cu|&s;tody;
for fir&s;t his Maje&s;ty order'd that the princi|pal
Contrivers and Encouragers of the &s;aid Rebel|lion
&s;hould be brought before him, and after he
had him&s;elf re-examin'd them, they having before
been condemn'd in a full Hearing before all the
Lords; they were all Sentenc'd to Death, among
whom were Prince <HI>Colorin,</HI> General <HI>Romanodo&s;|lowski,</HI>
with &s;everal Ladies of Quality, and Friars
and Prie&s;ts of the fir&s;t Rank, &s;ome of them were be|headed,
&s;ome broke upon the Wheel, others bu|ried
alive, and the afore&s;aid <HI>Strelitzes</HI> or Soldiers,

had in &s;everal In&s;tances &s;hew'd their will and
readine&s;s to revolt upwards of 2000 of them
were executed, &s;ome their Heads taken of in the
publick Market-place, others hung up upon Gal|low&s;es
erected on purpo&s;e at the Gates of all the
three Walls round the City, with the Crimes
writ upon the Gallows: This Execution being per|form'd
in the depth of Winter, their Bodies were
immediately bury'd; tho&s;e that were beheaded, were
order'd to lie in the &s;ame po&s;ture, as their Heads
were cut off, in Ranks upon the ground, with
their Heads lying by them; and tho&s;e which were
hang'd round the Walls of the City were left
hanging, the whole Winter in the &s;ame po&s;ture to
the view of the People, till the warm Weather
began to come on in the Spring, and then they
were taken down and buried in a Pit together, to
prevent the infection of the Air.</P>
<P>THERE was likewi&s;e other Gibbets plac'd on all
the publick Roads leading to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> at about two
Miles di&s;tance, where others of the&s;e Rebels
were hang'd, and a large Monument of Stone
erected upon the &s;everal Roads, with the De|&s;cription
of their Crimes deeply engraven, and
order'd to be repair'd and kept up for ever, and
the very Hou&s;es wherein they had liv'd were or|der'd
to be raz'd to the ground, and the Name of
<HI>Strelitzes</HI> to be no more made u&s;e of in the Army
of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> forever, but being chang'd, from that
time they were call'd <HI>Soldatee</HI> or <HI>Soldiers;</HI> &s;uch of

<P>THUS his Maje&s;ty upon his return from his Tra|vels
by the example of &s;o vigorous a Proceeding
having &s;urpre&s;s'd the Enemies to his Government,
it was the more ea&s;ie for him to go on with the&s;e
things, which he had re&s;olv'd upon for the reforming
his Country; he began fir&s;t, with e&s;tabli&s;hing his
Guards, which were tho&s;e Regiments that were fix'd
in the Place of the afore&s;aid <HI>Strelitzes;</HI> then put
his whole Army upon a new Foot, form'd a new Di&s;|cipline,
which he had collected from what he had
ob&s;erv'd Abroad, and he order'd all his Army to be
regularly Cloath'd, with &s;ome di&s;tinction in the
Colour and Trimming of the Cloaths like the cu|&s;tom
of other Nations of <HI>Europe;</HI> this had not till
now been done in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> but every one wore his
Claths according to his own Fancy; he order'd
al&s;o an Account to be brought to him of &s;uch Per|sons
of the Nobility and Gentry of con&s;iderable
E&s;tates, who were not in any Service or Employ|ment;
out of which he commanded a great part
to go and &s;erve as Voluntiers in the Army, and
others he order'd to attend, and appointed them
Duty in &s;everal Stations, &s;ome in Equipping his
Navy, and others order'd to go and re&s;ide at the
frontier Garri&s;ons, that if they did no good, they
might be out of the way of doing any Mi&s;chef.</P>
<P>WHEN he had thus di&s;pos'd things in <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI>
with Relation to his Army, he went down him&s;elf
to <HI>Veronize</HI> to view tho&s;e Ships and Gallies that
were built there by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in his Ab&s;ence, and
to ha&s;ten the Equipment of his Fleet that was prepa|ring
for the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> he made tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that he
<PB N="91" REF="92">
had brought over with him chief Ma&s;ter-builders,
and di&s;charg'd all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Builders, except what
were to fini&s;h the Ships which they had begun, and
tho&s;e were left under the Command of the <HI>English,</HI>
Ordering that there &s;hould be none but <HI>English</HI> fa|&s;hion'd
Ships to be built for the future; one of which
being a Ship of 50 Guns, his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf im|mediately,
as &s;oon as he came there &s;et upon the
Stocks, by a Draught which he had drawn with his
own Hands; and &s;o contriv'd her by an Invention
of his own, that tho' the Keel &s;hould be knock'd off,
the Ship &s;hould be Tight as he propos'd; which
Ship when he had advanc'd a little way, he left
to be carried on by two young <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Gentle|men,
that had been Abroad with him, and learn|ed
to build Ships along with his Maje&s;ty; only he
left Orders for them to ask &s;ometimes Advice of
the <HI>English</HI> Builders, when there was any occa&s;ion
for it; he left al&s;o Orders at <HI>Veronize</HI> with Vice
Admiral <HI>Cru&s;s,</HI> and Real Admiral <HI>Raes,</HI> together
with the Sea Captains, Officers and Seamen that
he had taken into his Service in <HI>Holland,</HI> before
he went over to <HI>England,</HI> and who were now
arriv'd in <HI>Veronize</HI> to get tho&s;e Ships and Gallies
that were built there, rigg'd and ready fitted, to
Sail down to <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> whither he intended to go
with them in the Spring of the Year, together with
his Favorite <HI>le Fort,</HI> who tho' he knew nothing
of the Sea, was declar'd Admiral.</P>
<P>WHEN his Maje&s;ty had thus &s;ettled the Affairs
of his Navy, as he had before done of his Army, he
return'd back again to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> where be&s;ides what
he had done at his fir&s;t coming over, he made a
Choice of Lords to be of his Council, and begun
to regulate Affairs in Government, both in the
Church, and in the State.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93">
AND now we are to Enter in the Cour&s;e of his
Maje&s;ty's Hi&s;tory on a new Scene of Action, and
of a differing kind from what he had ever known
before: Hitherto all his Enterpri&s;es had been at|tended
with an uninterrupted Cour&s;e of Succe&s;s;
his Wars with the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> happening
at a time when the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Power &s;eem'd to be in
a <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> went all to his Content, and Victory at|tended
his Arms upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>BUT now his Maje&s;ty had another kind of E|nemy
to deal with, I mean the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI>
who&s;e Fume, tho' yet it had made no Noi&s;e in the
World, yet he was attended with a well di&s;ciplin'd
Army, a Nation fierce and daring, who&s;e Reputa|tion
in Arms, was equal, if not Superior to the
mo&s;t glorious Nations in the World.</P>
<P>WHEN his Maje&s;ty, as I have ob&s;erved, went
from <HI>Vienna</HI> in ha&s;te to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> he was not how|ever
&s;o much alarm'd with the News of his Rebel|lious
Subjects, but that he found room in his
Thoughts as well as lei&s;ure in his &s;peed, for a &s;hort
Interview with the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> thro' who&s;e
Dominions he was nece&s;&s;arily oblig'd to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>A LITTLE time may contrive what a great
many Years may be employ'd to Execute; here in
a few Hours they concerted that dreadful War be|tween
them, and the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> which pro|ved
at fir&s;t &s;o fatal to them both, and which in
its whole Cour&s;e was fatal to all the Northern
Part of <HI>Europe,</HI> de&s;tructive to the whole Coun|tries
and in which fir&s;t and la&s;t above 500000
People have lo&s;t their Lives; nay, I have heard
it affirm'd that <HI>Sweden</HI> alone has by this very
War been drein'd of 300000 Men to the irrepara|ble
De&s;olation of that Kingdom, and we &s;hall
find abundant of Rea&s;on to believe that <HI>Poland</HI> and
<PB N="93" REF="94">
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and the <HI>Provinces</HI> adjoyning, put them
all to gether have lo&s;t a much greater Number.</P>
<P>IT was not however till the Year 1700, that
the War between the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was openly declar'd after there had
been a &s;eeming renewing of the Peace between
them the Year before.</P>
<P>THIS War they &s;ay was concerted between
the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty at
this Interview, and the Mea&s;ures agreed on; al&s;o
how the &s;ame &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted, and &s;ome Mea|&s;ures
too for the engaging the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>
in the League; which propo&s;al afterwards prov'd
Succe&s;sful, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> Succe&s;sful to bring the
King of <HI>Denmark</HI> in, but Un&s;ucce&s;sful to all the
three in the beginning of it, as will appear in the
pro&s;ecution of the Story.</P>
<P>IT was now in the Year 1699, when the <HI>Czar</HI>
had &s;pent about eight Months at Home, and
News was brought him to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> that his Ple|nipotenaries
had concluded a Truce with the <HI>Turks</HI>
at <HI>Carlowitz,</HI> where at the &s;ame time, the Peace
between the <HI>Turks</HI> and the other Allies, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the
Emperor, the King of <HI>Poland</HI> and the State of <HI>Ve|nice</HI>
had been concluded.</P>
<P>IT was &s;ugge&s;ted that the <HI>Czar</HI> de&s;ir'd that tho'
the other Allies made a Treaty for 25 Years with
the <HI>Turks,</HI> that yet his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's part &s;hould
be no more than a kind of Truce for two Years; and
that he did this, that he might have time in tho&s;e
two Years to compleat the Fortifications of <HI>A&s;oph,
Kai&s;ikermeen,</HI> and other Places; and to build a power|with
ful Fleet of Men of War at <HI>Veroneze,</HI> with
which at the end of the two Years, he doubted not
to be able to di&s;pute the Lord&s;hip of the <HI>Black Sea</HI>
with the Grand <HI>Seignior,</HI> and to bring him to
<PB N="94" REF="95">
grant a Pa&s;&s;age for his Subjects through the <HI>Bo&s;&s;|phor$s</HI>
into the <HI>Levant</HI> Seas.</P>
<P>BUT this was a blu&s;ter which his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty had no Hand in, and 'tis apparent it was
the <HI>Turks,</HI> who declin'd a Truce with <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> for
any longer than two Years, purpo&s;ing as it was
apparent afterward that when they had got the
<HI>Hungarian, Venetian</HI> and <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> War off of their Hands,
they would fall upon the <HI>Czar</HI> with all their
Forces for the Recovery of <HI>A&s;oph, &amp;c.</HI> But the
<HI>Czar,</HI> who was &s;en&s;ible how heavy &s;uch a War
would be upon him, at lea&s;t till he had brought
his Army into all the new Mea&s;ures he had de|&s;ign'd,
apply'd immediately to the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
who was Mediator of that Treaty to give
In&s;tructions to his Plenipotentiaries at the Treaty,
to in&s;i&s;t that the Peace with <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> might
have the &s;ame Duration of 25 Years, as the Peace
with the Emperor had, which his <HI>Britanick</HI> Ma|je&s;ty
did, and obtained it for him accordingly,
which we &s;hall &s;ee in a little time acknowledged
under his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's own Hand.</P>
<P>ACCORDINLY the Treaty was, I <HI>&s;ay,</HI> conclud|ed
at <HI>Carlowitz,</HI> and immediately the <HI>Czar</HI> began
the War again&s;t the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> for the &s;ame
Day that the Peace with the <HI>Turks</HI> was proclaim'd
at <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> the &s;ame Day the War was proclaim'd
again&s;t <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE nothing to do to enter here into a Di&s;|qui&s;ition
of the Ju&s;tice of this War, or of the
particular Cau&s;es moving the <HI>Czar</HI> to engage in it:
That his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was Agre&s;&s;or, that we
do not di&s;pute, one of the Cau&s;es a&s;&s;ign'd was the
Affront offer'd his Amba&s;&s;adors at <HI>Riga,</HI> which
con&s;idering that his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf was in Per|&s;on
<PB N="95" REF="96">
in the Train, was &s;peaking the Language of
Princes a very great Indignity to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty,
and &s;ufficient to demand Satisfaction upon.</P>
<P>IN Con&s;equence however of having declar'd
War, it behov'd his Maje&s;ty to make &s;uitable
Preparations, for that he knew that he had a vi|gilant
and gallant King to deal with, tho' but a
young Man, and that he was the Head of a brave
People, had a good Army of old, and di&s;ciplind
Soldiers on Foot, led by &s;ome of the able&s;t Gene|ral
in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, as the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was young,
and far off, and that the Alliance was &s;trong, even
three-fold, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had room to expect
he might have made a con&s;iderable Progre&s;s be|fore
any Number could be brought again&s;t him,
that would be to any purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS was began with the beginning of the
Year 1700, and his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty drew toge|ther
&s;uch a Body of Men, that had they been well
manag'd, would have been &s;ufficient to havewith
&s;tood a much greater Force than tho&s;e they were to
deal with; but the de&s;perate Bravery of the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
and the exact Di&s;cipline of their Troops &s;truck
&s;uch a Terror in the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> that in a Word,
there was no Oppo&s;ing them, nor any bringing
the Troops to keep their Array, when pu&s;h'd
with the violence of an Army of Men, that knew
how to die, and how to Conquer, but had not yet
been taught to fly.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI>'s Troops were wonderfully improv'd,
and infinitely better than they us'd to be, but,
were not yet come to a perfection &s;uitable to the
Work they had now before them; or to be a
Match for the <HI>Swedes;</HI> but as they had been put
into a Method of improving, yet farther we &s;hall
<PB N="96" REF="97">
find them in time be taught by the <HI>Swedes</HI> the
way of fighting, till they came to be a Match for
any Body, and at la&s;t learn'd to beat their Ma|&s;ters.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Romans</HI> by often beating the barba|rous
Nations, &s;uch as the <HI>Gauls,</HI> the <HI>Goths,</HI> the
<HI>Vandals,</HI> and the <HI>Huns,</HI> taught them the <HI>Roman</HI> di&s;|cipline,
and manner of Fighting; till tho&s;e Na|tions
return'd In&s;tructed how to Fight, and beat
their Teachers, not out of their Empire only, but
even out of the World.</P>
<P>IN order to Introduce the Hi&s;tory of this ter|rible
War in &s;uch a manner, as the Reader may
be fully inform'd of every Action, and of the na|ture
and rea&s;on of things, as he goes along with
the Fact; it will be nece&s;&s;ary to look a little into
the State of Affairs in tho&s;e Northern Parts of the
World in General, at that time, and how it came
to pa&s;s that tho&s;e three Powers, the <HI>Danes,</HI> the
<HI>Poles,</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> broke at once with <HI>Swe|den;</HI>
and how their Intere&s;t and Forces came &s;o to
be disjointed and &s;eparated, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> had
opportunity to attack them &s;ingly, and deprive
them of the Capacity of Succouring or A&s;&s;i&s;ting
one another, and this I &s;hall do as conci&s;ely as
I can.</P>
<P>AT fir&s;t his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty did not appear in
this Quarrel; but the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the
King of <HI>Denmark</HI> both at once, whether declaring
War, or not declaring War, is not the Que&s;tion,
having an Alliance for that Purpo&s;e, fell both of
them upon the King of <HI>Sweden:</HI> The King of <HI>Poland</HI>
march'd in Per&s;on at the Head of a powerful and
experienc'd Army of <HI>Saxons,</HI> out of <HI>Poland</HI> direct|ly
for <HI>Courland;</HI> from whence he continu'd his
March, and the 28th of July, 1700 pa&s;s'd the
<PB N="97" REF="98">
<HI>Dwina,</HI> enter'd into <HI>Livonia,</HI> the Dominions of
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and having beaten Count
<HI>Welling</HI> the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General, and the few Forces
he had with him, advanc'd towards <HI>Riga,</HI> and in|ve&s;ted
the Town, took the <HI>Dunamunder Schans,</HI>
began to Bombard the Town, but was prevail'd,
with to &s;pare it, in re&s;pect to the Effects of the
Foreign Merchants, as was given out, who were his
Allies, and &s;o Cantoning his Forces held the Town,
as it were Blocked up, re&s;olving to attack it in
Form the beginning of the next Year.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> ha|ving
attack'd the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;teins</HI> Fort at <HI>Hu&s;um;</HI>
and Bombarded <HI>Toningen,</HI> made no difficulty to
&s;peak openly of a Rupture with <HI>Sweden,</HI> and to ac|knowledge
that he was engag'd in Alliance with
the King of <HI>Poland:</HI> The <HI>Czar</HI> all this while lay
&s;till, and made a &s;eeming offer of continuing
Peace with <HI>Swede;</HI> but civily demanded the
Town and Port of <HI>Narva</HI> for the Convenience of
having a Trade for his Subjects into the <HI>Baltick,</HI>
which at that time was the great thing that the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>WHEN the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> had openly de|clar'd
him&s;elf, and the King of <HI>Poland</HI> had actually
attack'd <HI>Riga,</HI> then the <HI>Czar</HI> as had been concert|ed
between them at the enterview I mention'd, re|&s;olv'd
to declare him&s;elf al&s;o, and accordingly
as I have ob&s;erv'd before; the War again&s;t <HI>Sweden,</HI>
was Proclaim'd at <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> the &s;ame day that the
Peace with the <HI>Turks</HI> was al&s;o Proclaimed.</P>
<P>BEFORE I go on here, I mu&s;t pay a Debt
which is the reward of Vertue, and which &s;o much
Merit demands from every faithful Hi&s;tiorian, I
mean a Debt to the Memory of that truly great
and wi&s;e Man General <HI>Le Fort;</HI> a Man to whom
<PB N="98" REF="99">
the <HI>Czar</HI> owes much of the true Notions of Vertue,
and Honour, which he took in at his fir&s;t Entrance
upon his Government, who always gave him ju&s;t
and &s;olid Ideas of things, and who prompted him to
all the great Actions of his Life, and who died
a little before the&s;e new Mea&s;ures were taken.</P>
<P>THIS great Man was really treated by the
<HI>Czar</HI> according to his Merit, for he valu'd him a|bove
any of the greate&s;t Men in his whole Em|pire,
and depended entirely upon his Council in
the mo&s;t difficult Ca&s;es that came before him; he
was the principal Agent in all the Mea&s;ures the
<HI>Czar</HI> took in his Travels, was his fir&s;t Amba&s;&s;ador
<HI>as has been &s;aid</HI> in the great Emba&s;&s;y, was his Ple|nipotentiary
upon all Occa&s;ions of Treaty, and
in a Word, he was &s;o at the time of his Death, all
which &s;hewed that the <HI>Czar</HI> knew how to put a
ju&s;t value upon the Merit of tho&s;e who he
employ'd, and that he was a true Judge of Merit
in general: <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> he was at the time of his Death
chief General of his Armies, Admiral of all his
Fleets, and his chief Mini&s;ter: He had &s;erved the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> along time, by which he had advanc'd
him&s;elf to that degree of Honour, wherein he gli|ter'd
at his Death; the <HI>Czar</HI> had a particular Love
and E&s;teem for him, and was pleas'd to give the
World a demon&s;tration of it by the Funeral
which he be&s;tow'd upon him; for <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> had ne|ver
&s;een &s;o much Pomp before upon any occa|&s;ion
all the military Ceremonies of the inter|ment
were the &s;ame as in the&s;e more civiliz'd
Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> the Drums and Colours were co|ver'd
with black, the Officers of three Regiments
that preceeded the Hear&s;e, had black Scar$s, and
the Pikes garni&s;h'd at the top with Knots of black
Ribband; the En&s;igns of Honour belonging to
the deceas'd, were laid upon black Cu&s;hions em|broider'd
<PB N="99" REF="100">
with Gold; five Mini&s;ters preceeded
the Corps, three of which were of the reform'd
Religion, and two of the <HI>Ausburg</HI> Con&s;e&s;&s;ion and
one <HI>Stomnies</HI> preach'd the funeral Sermon, taking
for his Text the Words of the 8th Chapter <HI>Eccle|&s;ia&s;tes,</HI>
ver. 8. The <HI>Czar</HI> him&s;elf led the Regiments
in deep Mourning.</P>
<P>THE place of this Gentleman was fill'd up, I
cannot &s;ay it was &s;upply'd by Major General <HI>Car|lowitz,</HI>
and afterwards that of General of the Army
was made up, with the Duke <HI>de Croy,</HI> an Officer of
great Experience, and who had &s;erved the Emperor
many Campaigns again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> but he could
never come to be &s;o well e&s;teem'd or belov'd by
the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> them&s;elves, and con&s;equently not
be &s;o well followed.</P>
<P>THE War being thus re&s;olv'd on, the <HI>Czar</HI>
caus'd his Cavalry to draw together about <HI>Novo|gorod,</HI>
and particularly the Hor&s;e who had done
&s;uch great Service at <HI>A&s;poh</HI> were order'd by ea&s;y
Marches, for it is a prodigious long way, to ad|vance
to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> and thence to the Fronciers;
his Infantry at the &s;ame time were drawn together
from all Parts, and were computed to make very
near 100000 Men, the Hor&s;e were reported to be
25000; but the&s;e were not all the Troops prepa|red
for that Expedition, for his Maje&s;ty had a
con&s;iderable Body of Men, which were come to
<HI>Novogorod,</HI> but were not at the Battle at <HI>Narva,</HI> be|ing
tho&s;e who the <HI>Czar</HI> went in Per&s;on to bring for|ward,
which was the happy Rea&s;on that he was not
in the Battle him&s;elf; which if he had, he would
have run a very great Ri&s;que of being taken Pri|&s;oner
by the <HI>Swedes.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT the clo&s;e of the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd upon the War with <HI>Sweden,</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="101">
and in <HI>September,</HI> his Troops inve&s;ted <HI>Narva,</HI> his
Declaration of War having been in the mean time
publi&s;hed to all the World to the Purpo&s;e following.</P>
<P>THAT altho' the <HI>Swede</HI> had a&s;&s;ur'd the <HI>Czar</HI>
that he would maintain Peace with him, and bind
it by a &s;trict Amity, and Corre&s;pondence; and for
that Rea&s;on had &s;ent a &s;olemn Emba&s;&s;y to renew
his Treaties, neverthele&s;s his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty com|plain'd
and averred, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had un|derhand
made u&s;e of &s;everal Intrigues to cro&s;s his
De&s;igns, and among others had propos'd to the King
of <HI>Poland</HI> a League to act in Conjunction with
him again&s;t the <HI>Czar;</HI> and tho&s;e Intreagues were
the Cau&s;e in part of the difficulties which happen|ed
at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> in the Conclu&s;ion of the
Peace between the <HI>Czar,</HI> and the Port, which
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty cannot forbare to make
known to all the World, and particularly to all
Chri&s;tian Princes, in hopes they will acknowledge
that he has been oblig'd to make u&s;e of tho&s;e law|ful
Means, which he has in his Power for the
Pre&s;ervation of his Dominions; and that if he
has declar'd War again&s;t <HI>Swedeland,</HI> 'its only to
prevent her doing him any injury by &s;uch unju&s;t
Proceedings: The &s;econd Motive is, for that
the <HI>Czar</HI> and his Predece&s;&s;ors have always held a
&s;trict Alliance with the Kings of <HI>Denmark,</HI> by
Virtue of which, they were oblig'd to the mutual
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of each other, and reciprocally to re|venge
the Wrongs done to either; that the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> had Landed in Per&s;on in <HI>Zeeland</HI> with a
&s;trong Army, in the ab&s;ence of the King of <HI>Den|mark,</HI>
and put his capital City, and his whole
Kingdom in danger; that he had not only con|&s;train'd
the said Prince to make a di&s;advantageous
Treaty with the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> but had al&s;o
excluded the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's
<PB N="101" REF="102">
Friend and Confederate, that he might have an
Opportunity to oppre&s;s and utterly Ruin him,
that for the&s;e Rea&s;ons his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty found
him&s;elf oblig'd to revenge the Wrongs done his
Friends and Allies, and to break all the dange|rous
Practice again&s;t them.</P>
<P>AFTER this he &s;ent to his Re&s;ident in <HI>Sweden</HI>
to make known his Re&s;olutions to that Court,
and having his Levies ready, which are re|ported
to con&s;i&s;t of five and twenty Thou&s;and
Hor&s;e, and &s;eventy Thou&s;and Foot, together with a
Train of four Hundred and &s;ixty Cannon and Mor|tars;
he took Po&s;t for <HI>Ple&s;ko,</HI> to take a review
of his Forces; the command of which he had con|ferr'd upon <HI>Aframaon Go&s;owitz,</HI> as General, who has
under him <HI>Theodore Alexovitz Golovin,</HI> as General
of the Hor&s;e, with General <HI>Adan Wyde,</HI> and &s;everal
<HI>German</HI> Officers. Of the&s;e 'twas &s;aid that the <HI>Czar</HI>

<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden</HI> young in his Throne, and

and <HI>Holland,</HI> which appear'd, as (a kind of)
Umpire in the <HI>Baltick;</HI> I &s;ay encourag'd by

<HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e things were tran&s;acting, the King
of <HI>Poland</HI> made his Fruitle&s;s attempt upon <HI>Riga,</HI> of
which mention has been made already, I call it but
an attempt, for altho' he inve&s;ted the Place the 8th
<PB N="104" REF="105">
of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> he &s;pent two Months before it, without
any con&s;iderable Progre&s;s and then left his Army;
turning the Seige into a kind of Blockade, and &s;o
as if he had waited on purpo&s;e for the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> to come and beat him, did nothing till the
next Spring.</P>
<P>IN <HI>September,</HI> as I have ob&s;erv'd, the Troops
of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> began to move; it was a long &s;tep
they had to take; but the <HI>Czar</HI> being at the
Head of them, they made long Marches, and the
2d of <HI>November</HI> they joyn'd the Troops before
<HI>Narva.</HI> Hither the Duke <HI>de Croy</HI> came, with a|bout
fifty Gentlemen, all Officers of Experience,
and who came from <HI>Hungary,</HI> where they had
&s;erv'd the Emperor again&s;t the <HI>Turks;</HI> as &s;oon as
he arriv'd, the <HI>Czar</HI> who had invited him to his
Service, gave him the command of the Siege; him|&s;elf
commanding the Army; the other Officers
which he brought with him, were appointed Com|mands
in different Places, according to their parti|cular
Experience in Service.</P>
<P>THESE Gentlemen joyn'd to the foreign Of|ficers,
which his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had entertain'd
before, brought the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops into the be&s;t
Method of pro&s;ecuting a Siege; caus'd them to En|trench
their Camp, as well with Circumvalations,
as Contravallations, and had the Army been al|low'd
a Campaign or two for the Practice of tho&s;e
new Methods, the <HI>Swedes</HI> would not have had &s;o
cheap a Bargain of them; but as the Men might
be &s;aid to be put out of their old way of Fight|ing,
and not well acquainted, or fully Exerci&s;ed
in the New, between both, they were more ea&s;ily
put into Confu&s;ion.</P>

in their new Exerci&s;es, how regularly they
began to Fire, how well they plyed their Artil|lery,
and how &s;oon they hoped to make good

<PB N="107" REF="108">
about 20000 <HI>Swedes,</HI> all choice Troops, about the
beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>ON the 16th of <HI>Novem&punc;</HI> the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army be|gan
their March towards <HI>Narva:</HI> The <HI>Czar,</HI> who
fore&s;aw that the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> a daring and en|terpri&s;ing
young Prince, would play the de&s;perate
Game, &s;ent &s;ome &s;trong Detachments to &s;ecure
the Pa&s;&s;es at <HI>Sillajoggi,</HI> and on the &s;ide of <HI>Dorpat;</HI> not
doubting but that tho&s;e Troops, which were at lea&s;t
20000 Men, would give the <HI>Swedes</HI> &s;ome little &s;top
at Places &s;o easy to be defended, and at lea&s;t Cau&s;e
them to take a greater Compa&s;s about; in the
mean time his Maje&s;ty went him&s;elf for <HI>Novogo|rod,</HI>
to bring up a Body of 40000 Men, who were
by this time gotten thither, and to ha&s;ten their
March.</P>
<P>BUT the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> by a feint of pa&s;|&s;ing
by tho&s;e Detachments, having gotten between
them and their main Army, and thereby cut off
their Retreat, cau&s;ed a &s;trong Body to Face a|bout
and attack them, which Surprize a&s;&s;i&s;ted to
put them into di&s;order, &s;o that they made but a
faint Re&s;i&s;tance, and were &s;oon Defeated. This
opened the way to the attack of the grand Army,
which the <HI>Czar</HI> being ab&s;ent, and tho&s;e Troops
defeated, were extreamly di&s;courag'd.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the Duke <HI>de Croy,</HI> an old Soldier,
and not at a lo&s;s what to do, had the Men he Com|manded
been equal to the Work, po&s;ted his
Troops to all the Advantage the Ground would
admit, and did all that the be&s;t General in the
World could have done to animate them to a vi|gorous
Defence; he po&s;ted the Infantry in the
Entrenchment, where they fir'd as in a cover'd
Way, and a &s;econd Line to &s;upport them, and
the Cavalry behind them to &s;upport the Foot,
<PB N="108" REF="109">
with proper Intervals for them to Advance; but
the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Foot wanted the Pre$ence of their
Ma&s;ter to animate them, which had been better
than the 40000 Men he was gone to fetch; and
tho' they &s;tood their Ground bravely for &s;everal
Hours, and made a terrible fire upon the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
from behind their Entrenchment, by which a great
many of the brave&s;t of their Men were kill'd; yet
the <HI>Swedes</HI> animated by the Pre&s;ence of their
King, and General <HI>Rebinder</HI> at the Head of eight
Batallions, pouring fre&s;h upon that part of the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Line, which had been twice before at|tack'd,
there was no re&s;i&s;ting the de&s;parate Fury
of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Foot, led on by a general of as
much Fame as any in their Army, who fought at
the Head of them, like a Lyon, and was kill'd
in the very Action, altho' after the Troops were
entred: In &s;hort, the Line was forc'd in that
Place, and the Foot enter'd, and the Pioneers
immediately going to Work with the Shovel and
Pick-ax, wide &s;paces were made in the Brea&s;t-work
for the Hor&s;e to follow, who pre&s;ently Charging
in upon the Rear of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Foot, which
were in the other part of the Line, put all into
Confu&s;ion, the &s;econd Line advancing were then
Charg'd by the Victorious <HI>Swedes,</HI> and driven back
upon the Cavalry, who by that Means were put
into Di&s;&s;order, and had no room to come up to
the Charge; and thus the Day was lo&s;t: The re&s;t of
the Infantry, being &s;traightn'd within the Compa&s;s
of their Camp, had no room to make an orderly
Retreat, but were oblig'd to thro' down their Arms,
and take Quarter. The Hor&s;e not able to re&s;i&s;t
the Torrent after their Infantry were thus Defeat|ed,
made off and Retreated in as good order as
they could to <HI>Novogrod,</HI> in the way whether they
<PB N="109" REF="110">
were met, and their Spirits a little encouraged by
the Troops which were Advancing to their A&s;&s;i|&s;tance, and by the
<HI>Czar</HI> their Soveraign.</P>
<P>IT was ob&s;erv'd, that the <HI>Czar</HI> &s;hew'd not the lea&s;t
Di&s;order, either in his Countenance, or in his Con|duct,
when he had the News of the Defeat of his Ar|my,
or any Re&s;entment at his flying Troops; but
immediately apylyed him&s;elf to gather the &s;cat|ter'd
Troops together, encourag'd the Men, &s;poke
kindly to the Officers, and prepar'd to put a &s;top
to the pur&s;uit of the Conquerers, if their Succe&s;s
&s;hould prompt them to follow his Men, and to
put all things in a po&s;ture of Defence, in Ca&s;e
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;hould undertake any new
Enterpri&s;e, or attempt to pu&s;h farther into the
Country.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Swedes</HI> had not their Victory &s;o
cheap neither, as to be in Condition for any far|ther
attempt at that time of the Year. They had
by their own Confe&s;&s;ion lo&s;t above 3000 Men,
be&s;ides the wounded, among which were a great
many brave Officers, as General <HI>Rublinghen, Re|binder,</HI>
and &s;everal others; add to this, the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> had the Winter Sea&s;on before him,
which was already far Advanc'd; and as the
Snows and Fro&s;ts were not yet come in, the ways
were unpa&s;&s;able, and no Magazines erected for
providing the Army with Forage or Provi&s;i|ons;
so that he contented him&s;elf with having
relieved the Town, and beaten the Army, as he
might very well.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> advancing to <HI>Pe&s;kow</HI> within twelve
Leagues of <HI>Narva,</HI> made a &s;tand there, to give
his Men opportunity to return to their Colours,
which many did, who it was, thought had been lo&s;t,
and here his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Majesty form'd a new Army,
<PB N="110" REF="111">
in order to di&s;pute the Ground with the <HI>Swedes,</HI> if
they had offer'd to Advance.</P>
<P>BUT the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as I ob&s;erv'd, having
reliev'd <HI>Narva,</HI> and gain'd a compleat Victory,
put his Troops into Quarters of Refre&s;hment for
the Sea&s;on, and contented him&s;elf with boa&s;ting
of what great things he would do in the <HI>Czar</HI>'s
Dominions the next Year, and to give tho&s;e <HI>Ga|&s;conades</HI>
an Appearance of reality, he &s;ent
expre&s;s Orders to <HI>Sweden</HI> to &s;end over into <HI>Livonia,</HI>
with the fir&s;t of the Spring, that is, as &s;oon as the
Seas were open again, his whole remaining Army,
in the room of which they were order'd to make
new Levies for the common Guard of their Coun|try;
the&s;e Forces were &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of about
12000 Foot, and 6000 Hor&s;e, and Dragoons, but
Heaven and his own Fate found the King of <HI>Swe|den</HI>
other Work than to enter <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> or to Pro|&s;ecute
his Revenge at that time.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denyed, that had, the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> when tho&s;e Forces did arrive pu&s;h'd the
Advantages, which his late Victory had put into
his Hand, and per&s;ued his Revenge &s;ingly again&s;t
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Troops, tho' Numerous, be|ing
nothing like to what we find them to be
&s;ince, or as we may &s;ay to what the King of <HI>Swe|den</HI>
has taught them to be &s;ince, he might with
a victorious Army of 40000 Men, have bid fair for
the Ruin of the <HI>Czar,</HI> and of all his great De&s;igns;
but ju&s;t Heaven, who knew what a furious inexo|rable
Enemy, the <HI>Swede</HI> at that time was, tyed
up his Hands, till the <HI>Czar</HI> learnt how to Conquer
his Conqueror, and to beat him into a better
Knowledge of him&s;elf; making him pay for a like
de&s;perate Attempt upon the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> with the
lo&s;s of the Honour of all his former Victories,
<PB N="111" REF="112">
and of two &s;uch Armies as he never &s;aw him&s;elf
Ma&s;ter of afterwards, of all which in his order.</P>
<P>SUCCESS had now made the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
famous, I will not &s;ay it had made him in&s;olent,
becau&s;e a Hi&s;torian &s;hould write in Temper, e|ven
of tho&s;e Actions, which were not perform'd
in Temper, and treat all Sides with an impartial
Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had al&s;o another Call,
from the pur&s;uit of his Victory at <HI>Narva,</HI> and
this was the attempt of the <HI>Saxons</HI> upon the o|ther
&s;ide of <HI>Livonia,</HI> where the King of <HI>Poland</HI>
had, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> inve&s;ted <HI>Riga,</HI> taken the <HI>Dunamun|der
Schans,</HI> and had Quartered his Troops in &s;uch
a manner, as to hold the &s;aid City of <HI>Riga</HI> in a
manner block'd up.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Saxons</HI> were e&s;teem'd by the <HI>Swedes</HI> a more
Soldierly Enemy, than the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and at that
time, perhaps they were &s;o, but thus it is when Hea|ven
appoints to rai&s;e a young King to a pitch of
Glory beyond him&s;elf; the <HI>Saxons</HI> at <HI>Riga</HI> real|ly
behav'd wor&s;e a great deal than the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI>
at <HI>Narva,</HI> and were &s;o &s;hamefully beaten in
every Action, and even without Action, that
there could nothing be &s;aid for them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Army po&s;ted in their En|trenchments,
and encumber'd with the Lines, and
Circumvallations of a Camp, did their Duty till
being forc'd in one part, they were driven upon one
another and Defeated, meerly for want of Field
room, for their Cavalry to act in; for it cannot
be doubted, that had the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Calvalry;
which were at lea&s;t 25000 Hor&s;e and Dragoons,
had room to act, and to have fallen in, and &s;ur|rounded
the <HI>Swedes,</HI> as by their Number they were
able to have done, the <HI>Swedes</HI> would have paid
<PB N="112" REF="113">
much dearer for their Victory, than they did, if
perhaps they had not been &s;oundly beaten.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Saxons</HI> play'd the <HI>Poltrons</HI> in &s;uch an
egregious manner, as made even their own King
a&s;ham'd of them; and as encourag'd the <HI>Swedes</HI>
to pu&s;h into the Heart of <HI>Poland,</HI> at that time
wretchedly divided into factions and Parties, pro|&s;ecuting
mortal Feuds against one another, with
&s;uch an implacable Violence, that they cho&s;e
to Sacrifice their Country to the common E|nemy,
and bring a foreign War into their own
Bowels, rather than not pur&s;ue their private
Feuds and Family Quarrels, to the De&s;truction
of one another, and at la&s;t to the Ruin of their
King and their Country; which they brought into
an entire Subjection to the tyrannical Conqueror,
the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>I AM oblig'd to give an Account here of the
Progre&s;s of the War in <HI>Poland,</HI> becau&s;e the King
of <HI>Sweden;</HI> having by the impetuo&s;ity of his Vi|ctory
brought the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to the utmo&s;t
Di&s;tre&s;s, Rea&s;on and Policy of State, as well as
the natural Genero&s;ity of Friend&s;hip, brought his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty into the War, and made <HI>Poland</HI>
the Field, or Seat of the affair, as well between
the <HI>Czar,</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
as between the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> not thinking fit
to &s;eek his Enemy, the <HI>Czar</HI> at his capital City of
<HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> as he had given out he would; his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty was oblig'd to &s;eek him the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> out, even where he was to be found; as
we &s;hall &s;ee he did effectually in the Pro&s;ecution
of this War. This Defeat of the <HI>Saxons</HI> was a|bout
the beginning of July 1701, by which means
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dutchy
<PB N="113" REF="114">
of <HI>Courland,</HI> where in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Mittau,</HI> he
&s;eized the whole Magazine of Arms and Ammu|nition
belonging to, and laid up for the King of
<HI>Poland's</HI> Army, valued at 300000 Crowns, and
afterwards retook the Fort of <HI>Dunamunder,</HI> where
he found the Train of Artillery of the &s;ame Ar|my,
con&s;i&s;ting of 90 Pieces of Bra&s;s Cannon for
Battery, and 20 bra&s;s Mortars, which was a mo&s;t
agreeable Booty to a Prince ju&s;t entring upon a
War again&s;t two &s;uch Potent Nations, as the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> and the <HI>Poles.</HI></P>
<P>BUT leaving the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> guided by
his ill Fate to pur&s;ue and embarra&s;s him&s;elf in
the Affairs of <HI>Poland,</HI> where fir&s;t he will cloth
him&s;elf with Glory and load himself with Lawrels,
which mu&s;t be all taken from him in one Day, by
the more glorious Conqueror, the <HI>Czar;</HI> I &s;ay,
leaving him there to pur&s;ue his Fate, and omit|ting
the only offer that he will ever have of ruin|ing
his fir&s;t Enemy the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and
pu&s;hing his Victory in its proper time, which if
he had done, the <HI>Czar</HI> had perhaps never been
able to &s;tand before him: I mu&s;t now go back to
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's conduct after this capital
Blow given to his Forces before <HI>Narva.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE mention'd how his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
as if unconcern'd at the &s;urprizing News, ap|ply'd
him&s;elf to comfort and encourage his Offi|cers
and Soldiers, his Cavalry had not really
&s;uffer'd much, his Infantry indeed was ruin'd and
gone; but every Body knows foot Soldiers are
pretty cheap in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> where the <HI>Czar</HI> being
ab&s;olute Monarch, commands as many of his Peo|ple
to the Wars as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="115">
HOWEVR, this was not his Maje&s;ty's ca&s;e now, for
in&s;tead of commanding out &s;uch and &s;uch Num|bers
of Men, for the Summer Service, and let|ting
them go Home again when the Campaign
was over, perhaps, calling another Hundred
Thou&s;and out the next Year, who never &s;aw the
Field or an Enemy before, His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
now took a new Cour&s;e; he caus'd the Drums
to beat for Voluntiers over all his va&s;t Em|pire,
telling the People their Advantages, how
they &s;hould be new Cloathed, that they &s;hould be
duly Paid as Gentlemen Soldiers; and that in their
due Order, and as they merited by their Behavi|our,
they &s;hould be, Prefer'd and Rewarded; &s;o
that every Foot Soldier was capable of being not
a Captain only, but a General, if he behaved
well in his Po&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS which was a new Thing in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
went a great way, and caus'd a va&s;t Number of
Men to come in and Li&s;t, who were immediately
encouraged with half a Ruble advance Money,
and Weekly Pay, be&s;ides &s;ufficient to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them,
and make them live Ea&s;y and Plea&s;ant; be&s;ides
this&punc; his Maje&s;ty caus'd all the Boyars or Nobility
to $end a certain Number of Men, in proportion
to the Number of Servants which they kept, and
to the Revenue of their E&s;tates.</P>
<P>BY this means, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had his Ar|my
prefently full, &s;o that before the next Cam|paign,
he had near 120000 New li&s;ted Men ready
rai&s;ed, whom he caus'd to be form'd into Regi|ments
after the manner of <HI>Europe;</HI> &s;ome of four
Baltalions, &s;ome of two Battalions, and &s;ome of
but one Battalion, as he found Cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="116">
AS for the <HI>Strelitzes,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> had now &s;uppre&s;t
the very Name, and as much as po&s;&s;ible de&s;ir'd to
ra&s;e out the very Memory of them from the
Earth; in their Room his Maje&s;ty form'd &s;eve|ral
new Reigments of &s;elect choice Men; mo&s;t
of them old Soldiers, and a great many of
them <HI>Germans,</HI> or Foreigners of other Nations,
tho' none of them were admitted but &s;uch as had
&s;erv'd Abroad in &s;ome of the Wars, either on the
<HI>Danube</HI> or the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>AS the <HI>Czar</HI> had lei&s;ure thus to rai&s;e this Ar|my;
&s;o the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> being fully engag'd
in pur&s;uing the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> as a particular
Enemy, gave his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty full Lei&s;ure to
make all his new Army, what they never could be
&s;aid to be before; that is, not only Men, but Sol|diers,
for they had lei&s;ure to be fully acquainted
with their Arms, and to under&s;tand how to do
their Exerci&s;e after the <HI>German</HI> method by beat
of Drum: He po&s;ted them al&s;o in great Bodies
upon the Frontiers of <HI>Livonia,</HI> where, tho' the
<HI>Swedes</HI> behav'd with their wanted Bravery and
oftentimes were too hard for them; yet in their
turn they beat the <HI>Swedes</HI> too, and oftentimes
$ut whole Parties of them in Pieces; by which they
began to be enured to the War, acquainted them|&s;elves
with the New manner of Fighting; learn'd to
look a bold Enemy in the Face, and to find that
the <HI>Swedes</HI> were not invulnerable or invincible: In
a Word, they learn't by frequent fighting the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
not to be &s;o much afraid of them, as u&s;ual, and
thus if they did not always beat the <HI>Swedes;</HI> yet
they continually harra&s;s'd them, and wa&s;ted their
Numbers, which the <HI>Swedes</HI> not being ea&s;ily Re|$ruited
with Numbers as the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> were, and
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> pu&s;hing his Re&s;olution of de|po&s;ing
<PB N="116" REF="117">
King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> with &s;uch vigour, that he
as it were neglected his own Subjects of <HI>Livonia:</HI>
The <HI>Czar</HI> improving in the mean time every op|portunity,
and keeping his Troops full, &s;end|ing
con&s;tant Supplies of fre&s;h Men to make up
the Lo&s;s of tho&s;e that were kill'd, or di&s;abled;
his Reigments in <HI>Livonia</HI> became in two or three
Year equal with the <HI>Swedes</HI> in goodne&s;s of the
$word$, and infinitely Superiour to them in Num|$$r,
till the <HI>Swedes</HI> came to be beaten oftentimes,
Hand to Hand with equal Numbers, were pu&s;h'd
from Po&s;t to Po&s;t, and at la&s;t pu&s;h'd out of the
whole Province, as we &s;hall &s;ee its in Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time the Troubles of <HI>Lith$ania</HI>
ope$'d a Door for the two Enemies, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI>
and the <HI>Swedes</HI> to enter on that Side. The two great
Families of <HI>Saphiea</HI> and <HI>Ogin&s;ki,</HI> had brought
their Breach, which was at fir&s;t but a private
Quarrel, to be an open War: <HI>Ogin&s;ki</HI> was &s;up|ported
by the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and <HI>Saphiea</HI> call'd
in the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to his Succour, and he (the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI>) e&s;pous'd the <HI>Saph$iea's,</HI> and made
them Superiour to <HI>Ogin&s;ki</HI> and his Party; &s;o <HI>Ogin|&s;ki</HI>
finding the King of <HI>Poland</HI> not able to &s;up|port
him, having his handful of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> he
call'd in the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> to his aid; his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty
taking him into his Protection, did not a&s;&s;i&s;t
him with a handful of Men, as it were on purpo&s;e
to prolong the War, but at two or three times
&s;ent him at lea&s;t 30000 Men; &s;o that tho' the
<HI>Swedes</HI> had many times the better of him too, yet
he always maintain'd him&s;elf in the Field, till
all went to wreck, and King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> him&s;elf
was Forc'd to abandon them all, and quit the
Crown, of which in its Place.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118">
THESE Tran&s;actions kept the World in &s;u&s;|pence
three or four Years, during which time, the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops gain'd every Day new Expe|rience,
and new Reputation in the World, being
by the <HI>Czar's</HI> particular Direction all fill'd, not
only with <HI>German</HI> Officers, but having among
them abundance of <HI>German, Poli&s;h,</HI> and other fo|reign
Soldiers, mo&s;t of them Men of Service, and
who had been fully acquainted with the War be|fore
they were entertain'd and as his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty
gave very good Encouragement to all
Strangers, who Li&s;ted in his Troops, he had a
great many De&s;erters, even from the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI>
Troops them&s;elves.</P>
<P>BUT this was not all, for as he &s;oon after
this, Conquer'd whole Provinces from the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> and had occa&s;ion to act with his Armies in
&s;everal parts of the Empire, as in <HI>Pomeren</HI> in the
Dutchy of <HI>Mecklemburgh</HI> in <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> and in <HI>Den|mark;</HI>
&s;o he fail'd not of entertaining all the a|ble
Experience'd Soldiers he could get in all tho&s;e
Countries; by which means many of his Regi|ments,
and particularly his Guards were made up
of the choice&s;t Men all that part of the World could
affrod: As for the Provinces conquer'd from <HI>Swe|den,</HI>
the <HI>Czar</HI> has rais'd all the Men that it was
po&s;&s;ible to get in <HI>Livonia,</HI> and in <HI>Finland,</HI> of whom
he has in his Army at this time &s;everal whole
Regiments; particularly of <HI>Finlanders,</HI> who being
&s;ome of the be&s;t, the bolde&s;t, and mo&s;t hardy Men
of all the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI> Dominions, are now
the <HI>Czar's</HI> proper Subjects, and the la&s;t levey the
<HI>Czar's</HI> Generals made there, was of 3500 Men,
which I am told are form'd into one Regiment,
and call'd the Royal <HI>Finlanders;</HI> but 'tis added
that the <HI>Czar</HI> chu&s;es to employ that Regiment in the

remoter part of his Country again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI>
lea&s;t when they come to act again&s;t their old
Ma&s;ter the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> they &s;hould play
Booty, and go over to his Side.</P>
<P>I NEED give no farther Account, either why,
or how the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops came to be what we
&s;ee they are; Namely, equal to other Nations in
the Field; but I may take the liberty to add, that
if the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops come to be as good as the
<HI>Swedes,</HI> or other Neighbouring Nations; it mu&s;t
be allowed, that their Numbers are &s;o far Superior
to them, that there will be no room for the Fu|ture
for that Contempt, with which tho&s;e Nations
have formerly look'd on the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>IT is a &s;peculation worthy the be&s;t and greate&s;t
Polititians of <HI>Europe,</HI> how much the ma&s;culine
Genius of one Prince, may alter the Circum&s;tances
not of his own Subjects only, but of all the Nations
in the World that are any way influence'd by them;
for as they are of Weight in the Ballance of
the Nations, &s;o the Intere&s;t of the Neighbouring
Nations, are more or le&s;s concern'd to Support, or
Suppre&s;s them.</P>
<P>THE Empire of the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> extend|ed
as it is from the North to the South, for the
length of 2500 Miles, that is to &s;ay, from the North
Sea, bounding the Coa&s;t of the <HI>R&s;&s;ian Laponia,</HI> in
the Latitude of 72 or from the extream Part of
<HI>Nova Zembla,</HI> in the Latitude of 81, to the Coa&s;ts

<P><PB N="119" REF="120">
I CAN liken the &s;ituation of the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;|covy's</HI>
Dominion to nothing &s;o well, as to a well
cho&s;en &s;trong Encampment, plac'd in a piece of

and the Front &s;o Fortify'd, as not to be ea&s;ily

<P>THIS Front is guarded on its <HI>Right Wing,</HI> by

with inacce&s;&s;ible Shores, and a multitude of well

by <HI>Wyburg, Cron&s;loot, Petersbourgh, Narva,</HI> and <HI>Re|vel,</HI>
to <HI>Riga,</HI> and the Shores of <HI>Courland,</HI> with the

<P>ALL the middle of this immen&s;e Front is

<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> if once his Army is prepar'd as I have
ob&s;erv'd, to come Hand to Hand$with any of the
Nations that lye thus on its Front, is able to Sally

<HI>Swedes,</HI> for the Lo&s;s &s;u&s;tain'd at the Battle of
<HI>Narvaa;</HI> for Prince <HI>Czeremet,</HI> who Commanded

at length the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General <HI>Slipping|back,</HI>
having gotten together an Army of about
Ten Thou&s;and Men, all <HI>Swedes</HI> and old Soldiers,
and pre&s;uming upon the good Fortune of <HI>Narva,</HI>
and the u&s;ual contempt they had for the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
Troops, oppos'd him&s;elf to the Prince; but he
paid for his Ignorance and Ra&s;hne&s;s, by the entire
Defeat of his whole Army, who were over-thrown,
and almo&s;t all cut in pieces by the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, the <HI>Swedes</HI> fought like Lyons, or like
Furies rather, and that in the Fight they pu&s;h'd
whole Brigades of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Infantry, put
them into Confu&s;ion, and in that Confu&s;ion, they
<PB N="122" REF="123">
flaughter'd many of them; and this is doing the
<HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> valour Ju&s;tice, for indeed they were over|come
by meer Numbers.</P>
<P>BUT ju&s;t the &s;ame they would have &s;aid of the

been repul&s;ed, that having an Army of 100000 Men
to deal with, his Men were overlay'd by the
innumerable Multitudes of their Enemies; that
they Fought like Lyons, but what could Men
do, who had an Army of $ix to one to deal with?
That Valour gave way at la&s;t to Number, <HI>and
the like,</HI> and had the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Army had Field
room in that Action at <HI>Narva,</HI> and not been
Coup'd up in a Camp, where the foremo&s;t Troops
being put into di&s;order, the re&s;t were driven one
upon another, and made the In&s;truments of their
own Ruins; I &s;ay, had not this been the Ca&s;e,
'tis very like the <HI>Swedes</HI> had talk'd of the Action
at <HI>Narva,</HI> as they do now of that near <HI>Dorpat.</HI></P>
<P>BUT 'tis an an&s;werable return, which is made
to this; what an Un&s;oldierly ra&s;hne&s;s was it for
General <HI>Slippenback,</HI> to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be at|tack'd,
or pretend to Fight with 10000 Men, a|gain&s;t
60000? for &s;o many the <HI>Swedes</HI> &s;ay the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> were; nay, and if it be true, that as
they &s;ay, General Slippenback was not above 6000
the pre&s;umption was the greater for Ra&s;hne&s;s,
and Temerity in Actons of War, are not to be
call'd Valour and Bravery, but Madne&s;s and Folly.</P>
<P>BUT to come to the Fact, it was from the Be|ginning
of <HI>May,</HI> 1702, that the Ru&s;&s;ians were
known to be drawing together; above 70000
Men, lay about <HI>Pl$&s;kow</HI> and the Frontiers of
the <HI>Czar's</HI> Dominions, and were encrea&s;ing
every Day: Now had the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> thought
his Province of <HI>Livonia</HI> worth &s;ecuring, or had
<PB N="123" REF="124">
he not flattered him&s;elf, that the Ru&s;&s;ians would not
dare to appear in the Field, but that they would
be frighted with the Names of the <HI>Swedes;</HI> that the
Scripture Prophe&s;ie was to be fulfilled in <HI>Livo|nia,</HI>
in favour of his Men, <HI>That One &s;hould Cha&s;fe a
Thou&s;and, and Two put ten Thou&s;and to flight:</HI> I &s;ay,
had he not filled his Head with the mo&s;t de&s;pica|ble
Opinion of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> he would never have
left &s;uch a Province as <HI>Livonia</HI> to be devour|ed,
and &s;uch gallant Troops as the <HI>Swedes</HI> really
were, to be cut in pieces in &s;mall Bodies for want
of Succour; while he was pur&s;uing his Revenge,
and talking upon him the giving a King too,
and pulling down a King from the Throne of his
Neighbour, the Kingdom of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>BUT thus it was, the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army entred <HI>Li|vonia</HI>
Commanded by the Prince of <HI>Czeremetoff,</HI>
about the beginning of July. They were not
ignorant that the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General <HI>Slippenback,</HI>
lay encamp'd between <HI>Dorpat,</HI> and Revel, tho'
the Prince had not any Account of his Numbers,
and if he had, itcould not be depended upon, be|cau&s;e
he might be &s;uppos'd to receive Additions
every Day from <HI>Revel,</HI> and <HI>Riga,</HI> which were in
his Reer, and from the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General <HI>Myerfield</HI>
in <HI>Lithuania:</HI> For this Rea&s;on the Prince did not
undertake any Siege, re&s;olving to make War in
the open Field, and fir&s;t &s;eek out and fight his
Enemy, that he might not have the &s;ame Game
to Play, as had been fatally play'd at <HI>Narva.</HI></P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e the Prince march'd on, and
the 16th of <HI>July,</HI> having an Account that the
<HI>Swedes</HI> march'd towards him, he advanc'd di|rectly
forward: The <HI>Swedi&s;h,</HI> General hearing
what disparity of Numbers he had to engage with,
halted at a Village call'd <HI>Stagnitz</HI> on the River
<PB N="124" REF="125">
<HI>Emback,</HI> as if he had re&s;olv'd to expect the <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ians</HI>
There; and &s;o far was he from being &s;en&s;ible
of the odds there was between them, that he did
not &s;o much as offer to Entrench; but with an Ar|rogance
inimitable, kept his Situation, till the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> came in view, being in full March to attack
him, and in admirable Order of Battle: A little
&s;urpris'd with the Sight, he then, when it was too
late, put his Men in March, and repa&s;s'd the River
upon two Bridges, breaking the Bridges behind
him; but this only &s;erv'd to bring him to a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of Fighting afterwards, in a Situation not
more Advantagious than the fir&s;t; for the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI>
pa&s;&s;ing al&s;o the River at &s;ome di&s;tance; and be|ing
drawn up again as before, mov'd directly to|wards
them. Then it was the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General
boldly Fac'd about, and re&s;olv'd to Fight. The
oon&s;equence of which was, his being over-thrown,
and entirely defeated, and all his Infantry cut in
pieces, as I have &s;aid; tho' not till after an ob|stinate
and bloody Fight, which la&s;ted almo&s;t a
whole Day.</P>
<P>NOW that I may not be Partial in the Rela|tion
of this Action, I &s;hall give their own Ac|count,
which they &s;ent to all the Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI>
and which excepting the &s;mallne&s;s of their own
Number kill'd, we are content to refer to, which
is as follows,</P>
<P>UPON July 6, we &s;ay the <HI>Swedes</HI> receiv'd Intelli|gence,
that the <HI>mu&s;covites</HI> were enter'd into <HI>Livo|nia</HI>
with a numerous Army, and were advanc'd as
far as <HI>Crosfort;</HI> the next Day our avant Couriers
being repuls'd to our Guards, General <HI>Slippenback</HI>
detach'd 300 Hor&s;e to ob&s;erve the Enemy: This
Party upon the 18th in the Morning, met with a
Body of a 1000 <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> which they attack'd,
<PB N="125" REF="126">
and drove to the Body of their Army, but the
<HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Cavalry being &s;urpris'd at the &s;ight of
&s;uch a numerous Ho&s;t, dur&s;t not make any long
&s;tay, but retreated in great Confu&s;ion; &s;o that
being pur&s;u'd by the Enemy, we lo&s;t Major <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI>
and &s;ome other Officers, who were &s;lain; the
Major General being inform'd of what had hap|pen'd,
rod him&s;elf to view the Enemy's Army,
and pre&s;ently perceiving they had a de&s;ign to &s;ur|round
his &s;mall Body; he judg'd it convenient by
the Advice of a Council of War, to cro&s;t the Ri|ver
of <HI>Emback,</HI> to prevent their De&s;ign; which was
done in view of the Enemy, and in very good
order over two Bridges that were broken, &s;o &s;oon
as our Men were over; but the River being then
very low, and the Enemy making u&s;e of &s;everal
Pontons to waft over their Artillery, 'twas im|po&s;&s;ible
to prevent their pa&s;&s;ing with the re&s;t of
their Army; &s;o that General <HI>Slippenback</HI> find|ing
that a great Number of the Enemy were al|ready
got on our Side, could not avoid coming
to a Battle; all the Advantage at the beginning
was on our Side; we beat the Enemy every
where, we pur&s;u'd them above a <HI>German</HI> Mile; we
took from them &s;ix pieces of Cannon, part of their
Baggage, and &s;ome Colours, and at length we
pre&s;s'd &s;o hard upon 'em, that they threw them|&s;elves
into the River; but the re&s;t of their
Army a&s;ham'd to fee their Fellows fly, and mad
to be beaten by &s;uch a &s;mall Number of Men, Fac'd
about of a &s;udden, and put the <HI>Finland</HI> Cavalry
into &s;uch di&s;order, that they fell foul upon the
Infantry, and betook them&s;elves to flight, with|out
any po&s;&s;ibility of being rally'd, &s;o that our
Artillery, as well as that which we had taken, fell
<PB N="126" REF="127">
into the Enemies Power, and our Infantry after
a $tout re&s;&s;i&s;tance was almo&s;t cut in pieces: This
Action began about &s;ix in the Morning, and la&s;ted
for ten Hours together; our General would fain
have rally'd them again, and po&s;ted us at <HI>Helmer,</HI>
but finding it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;top the Hor&s;e that
were fled and di&s;pers'd, and being no longer a|ble
to &s;tand his Ground with the remains of his
Infantry, he was con&s;train'd to retreat to
<HI>Perna$.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this Occa&s;ion, the <HI>Swedes</HI> loft 7 Captains,
30 Lieutenants, 11 En&s;igns, and 25 Subalterns;
37 Drums, and 1916 common Soldiers; we know
indeed that the Lo&s;s of the Mu&s;covites was much
greater, but it was hardly preceptible, by rea&s;on
of their Multitude: After this Expedition the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> were about to have march'd back, but
they were hardly arriv'd at the <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Peipus,</HI>
when they receiv'd Orders to return, and put all
<HI>Livonia</HI> to Fire and Sword, which they have done
in a mo&s;t cruel manner, till within &s;ome Leagues
of <HI>Riga.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is their own Account in which the im|partial
Reader will certainly conclude, that had the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> Number been &s;o great, and theirs
&s;o &s;mall, as they would repre&s;ent them, it could
&s;carce be po&s;&s;ible that they could defend them|&s;elves
ten Hours, and be Defeated at la&s;t too;
having no Shelter, no Retreat, no Entrenchments
or Defences at all, but their Arms.</P>
<P>BUT the Sum of the Ca&s;e was, and that appears
by the Accounts publi&s;h'd at that time, that the
<HI>Swedes</HI> were no le&s;t than ten Thou&s;and Men, o|thers
lay fourteen Thou&s;and, and the publick
Papers printed at that Time, as al&s;o by Letters
from <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and from <HI>Riga</HI> at the &s;ame time,
<PB N="127" REF="128">
both to <HI>London,</HI> and to <HI>Holland,</HI> give this Account
in few Words, <HI>viz.</HI> &startq;That Prince <HI>Czeremet</HI> the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> General at the Head of a numerous
Army, had entirely defeated General <HI>Slippen|back,</HI>
with an Army of 10000 <HI>Swedes,</HI> not Far
from <HI>Dorpat,</HI> and that the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General with
a few Hor&s;e, who de&s;perately broke thro' the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army had e&s;caped; all the re&s;t of the
Army having been cut in pieces after a gallant
Re&s;i&s;tance, and a Fight, Which la&s;ted from eight
a-Clock in the Morning, to &s;even a-Clock at
Night.&endq;</P>
<P>THE la&s;t of the&s;e Accounts was certainly well
grounded, with this Exception only, that the
<HI>Swedes</HI> were not all cut in pieces, about 1200 be|ing
taken Pri&s;oners, with all their Baggage, Can|non,
Tents and Ammunition.</P>
<P>BUT the particular Rea&s;on why I publi&s;h here
their own Account of this Fight, is to repeat
what I have &s;o often mention'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>) of the dif|ference
between the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Soldiers now, and
what they were formerly; for now the <HI>Swedes</HI>
found, that after they had broke them &s;everal
times by the Fury of their Charge, and put them
into Confu&s;ion, yet that they rall$ed again by
the skill and dexterity of their Officers, and by
the aptne&s;s, and experience of their Soldiers, and
that they returned again to the Charge, after they
had been pu&s;h'd into Di&s;order; which was what
the <HI>Swedes</HI> did not expect to find among them,
and this was the ruin of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army.</P>
<P>AFTER this Action, the State of the War took a
new Turn; the <HI>Swedes</HI> were defeated upon all Oc|ca&s;ions,
and that not only an <HI>Livonia,</HI> but in <HI>Lithu|ani</HI>
al&s;o; <HI>Ogin&s;ki</HI> and his Friends, &s;upported by the
Troops the <HI>Gzar</HI> had &s;ent him, routed the <HI>Swedes</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="129">
twice in a Weeks time, killing 400, and taking 800
Pri&s;oners, in one Action, and killing 1000, and ta|king
700 in the &s;econd Action.</P>
<P>AFTER Prince <HI>Gzeremet</HI> had thus clear'd the Field
of his Enemy, he laid wa&s;t the whole Province., <HI>as a|bove;</HI>
the Rea&s;on was, that he found them univer&s;al|ly
aver&s;e to Submit, even when &s;ubdued; and that
upon an order from the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to the
Country, to take Arms, they did &s;o, and fell up|on
his Men wherever they found them.</P>
<P>THIS was what his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje$ty does not
delight in, nor does he &s;uffer his Troops to Practice
it in the other Countries of his Conque&s;ts; but
he had been treated with &s;uch per&s;onal Indignity
by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> on all Occa&s;ions, that he
found him&s;elf oblig'd to &s;hew his Re&s;entment;
and on the other Hand he was repre&s;ented by the
<HI>Swedes</HI> them&s;elves, as an Enemy &s;o contemptible,
that no Rules of Honour, or Ju&s;tice were to be ob&s;er|ved
with him; and it behov'd his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
on both the&s;e Accounts, to let the Subjects of <HI>Swe|den</HI>
know, that he was in a Condition to make
him&s;elf be better us'd, and that they might have
Rea&s;on to fear him, in&s;tead of in&s;ulting him.</P>
<P>THERE was al&s;o another Rea&s;on for this Severi|ty,
<HI>viz.</HI> that the great Towns of <HI>Livonia</HI> under who&s;e
Protection, the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Forces &s;heltered, might
not be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them; and al&s;o that his Ene|mies
might not fill their Magazines in <HI>Courland,</HI>
and in Lithuania out of the fruitful Provinces of
<HI>Livonia,</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;tonia.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this Execution, the Prince &s;at down be|fore
<HI>Dorpat</HI> with his whole Army, keeping at the
&s;ame time great Detachments of Hor&s;e to &s;cour
the Country to the Gates of <HI>Per$a$,</HI> and even to <HI>Ri|ga,</HI>
to prevent the <HI>Swedes</HI> gatheringany Number of
<PB N="129" REF="130">
Troops into a Body together, to attempt to Re|lieve
the Place.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e things went on thus pro&s;pe|rou&s;ly
in <HI>Livonia,</HI> the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army in <HI>Ingria</HI> were
no le&s;s Succe&s;sful, the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Skan&s;terny</HI> after a
vigorous Attack was &s;urrender'd to the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI>
and the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> General&mdash;<HI>Slippenbach</HI> with a
&s;trong Body of an Army being &s;ent to the Edge of
<HI>Finland,</HI> landed not far from <HI>Wyburgh</HI> with 24000
Men, in 400 Tran&s;port Ve&s;&s;els, and in a plain
Field gave Battle to the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Forces under Gene|ral
<HI>Crooniort,</HI> and entirely defeated them, the
<HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General, and a few of his Men making
their Retreat, and e&s;cap'd to <HI>Wyburg.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the whole Province of <HI>Ingermania</HI> or <HI>In|gria</HI>
fell into his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's hand, and his
Troops made daily Excur&s;ions upon the Enemy
in <HI>Finland</HI> it&s;elf (<HI>viz.</HI>) fir&s;t Thus</P>
<P>THE particulars of this Action are thus diver|&s;ly
related, fir&s;t thus.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> get Ground in
the&s;e Parts having lately obtain'd very con&s;idera|ble
Advantages over a volant Camp of the <HI>Swedes</HI>
commanded by General <HI>Crooniort</HI> in tho&s;e Quarters,
the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> with a Body of 25000 Men, being
conducted through by, and impracticable ways, fell
upon the <HI>Swedes</HI> when lea&s;t expected, and after a
bloody Fight, which la&s;ted from &s;ix in the Morn|ing
till two in the Afternoon, being much Supe|rior
in Number, put the <HI>Swedes</HI> to the Rout; how|ever
'tis &s;aid that the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General after a vi|gorous
Re&s;i&s;tance, made good his Retreat to <HI>Wy|burg:</HI>
There is &s;ince publi&s;h'd a more exact Rela|tion
of this Encounter between the <HI>Swedes</HI> and
<HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> which gives the following Account,
<PB N="130" REF="131">
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that General <HI>Crooniort</HI> having Advice, that the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> had fram'd a De&s;ign utterly to de&s;troy
his &s;mall Army, and for that end had embark'd
a great Number of Troops, in 8 Frigats, 400
&s;mall Tran&s;port Ve&s;&s;els, and two great Floating
Machines, whereon Batteries were plac'd, de&s;ign|ing
to Cannonade the Enemy with their Fleet,
while the re&s;t of their Army fell upon them by
Land; the Major General thereupon, &s;ent out
Parties to ob&s;erve the Motions of the <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI>
one whereof return'd towards Morning, and brought
Advice that they had di&s;cover'd &s;ome of their
Troops within an hours March of the <HI>Swedes</HI>
Out-guards, who immediately prepar'd to receive
them; the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> contrary to their Expectati|ons
finding the <HI>Swedes</HI> in a readine&s;s, drew back
in order to be joyn'd with more Troops, not far
behind; which they had no &s;ooner done, but they
return'd and Charg'd the <HI>Swedes</HI> with great vigour;
who, tho' but a handful as it were, defended
them&s;elves very well, till General <HI>Crooniort</HI> came
up to them with a Reinforcement of Hor&s;e and
Foot; but the Pa&s;s of <HI>Su&s;terback,</HI> where the <HI>Swedes</HI>
were po&s;ted, being too narrow for the Hor&s;e to
do any Service, the Foot were oblig'd to give way
to the Superiour Numbers of their Enemies, who
pre&s;s'd them clo&s;e at the Heels, and did not fail to
make the be&s;t of their Advantage; but the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI>
Hor&s;e coming up again, put a &s;top to their Progre&s;s;
the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General began then to di&s;cover from the
great clouds of Du&s;t that aro&s;e in &s;everal Places,
that the re&s;t of the <HI>Mu&s;covite's</HI> Army was coming
up with their Cannon, and not doubting but they
were infinitely &s;tronger then him&s;elf: His Army
not exceeding 4000 Men, the General thought it ad|vi&s;eable
to order the Foot to draw off with the Can|non
<PB N="131" REF="132">
and Carriages to <HI>Wyburg,</HI> on which the Enemy
&s;eem'd to have an Eye; and the rather becau&s;e
the General di&s;cover'd part of their Troops
marching along the Sea &s;ide, to get behind him; the
Foot retir'd in excellent order, while the General
taking the Advantage of the Ground with the
Cavalry alone, kept the Enemy in play (with
a Bravery not to be paralell'd) four Hours toge|ther,
when the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> retir'd, but threaten'd to
return in a &s;hort time: By a Li&s;t of the Pri&s;oners
taken and carryed away by the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> upon
this incur&s;ion, there are three Colonels, two Majors,
eighteen Captains, Twenty-five Lieutenants, three
Cornets, &s;eventeen En&s;igns; a Thousand Soldiers,
and a great Number of other Per&s;ons of both
Sexes.</P>
<P>HERE his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty contriv'd the Scheme,
and actually laid the Foundation of a new For|tre&s;s
at the Entrance of the <HI>Nye</HI> or <HI>Neva,</HI> the In|let,
which opens the Communication between the
Lake <HI>Ladoga,</HI> and the <HI>Baltick;</HI> which Fortre&s;s he
called <HI>Croon&s;lot</HI> and farther up his Maje&s;ty has
begun to build a Town, which he has call'd after
his own Name <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> or according to &s;ome
St. <HI>Petersburgh.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was at fir&s;t but a &s;mall Place, but &s;ince is
become a Royal City, and at pre&s;ent contains,
be&s;ides publick Edifices, Churches, and a Magni|ficient
Pallace, not yet quite fini&s;h'd above Thirty
Thou&s;and Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty having now, as has been
alledg'd Di&s;peopled the populous Provinces of <HI>Li|vonia</HI>
and <HI>Ingria,</HI> made the poor People &s;ome a|mends
by a Proclamation, or Placart, inviting
all the Families, not of tho&s;e Countries, but of
<PB N="132" REF="133">
all other Countries to come and Settle in his Do|minions,
and was to the purpo&s;e following, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>TO Invite all Sorts of Artificers, Workmen,
and People u&s;ing Manufactures, and other Per|&s;ons
profe&s;&s;ing Trades and Sciences, to come and
Settle in his Dominions; promi&s;ing them, that &s;o
&s;oon as they arriv'd upon the Frontiers, they &s;hall
be conducted where they plea&s;e to Settle; that they
&s;hall have the free Exerci&s;e of their Religion,
and the convenience of Churches; that they &s;hall
have the Liberty to employ them&s;elves in what|&s;oever
they &s;hall think mo&s;t for their Advantage,
without being Subject to any Duties, Offices or
Impo&s;ts: That as for tho&s;e who &s;hall find them|&s;elves
capable to undertake any Trade, and &s;hall
not have where withal to follow it, his Maje&s;ty
promi&s;es to &s;upply them with Money out of

<P>HIS Maje&s;ties Armies rang'd now freely over
both the&s;e Provinces, only with this Exception,
that the great Towns in <HI>Livonia, &amp;c.</HI> were &s;till in
the Hands of the <HI>Swedes;</HI> but having &s;ecur'd all
behind him, by the taking of the Places above|mention'd,
as al&s;o of <HI>Notteburg</HI> and of <HI>Nyen&s;chans.</HI>
His Maje&s;ty now re&s;olv'd to begin with the other
in the next Place, and &s;o fini&s;h the Reduction of
<HI>Livonia.</HI></P>
<P>IN <HI>December,</HI> 1702, the City of <HI>Narva</HI> had like
to have been &s;urpriz'd; but tho' the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> mi&s;s'd
their aim as to the Place, yet they did a great
deal $word$ mi&s;chief to the Suburbs, and defeated a
<PB N="133" REF="134">
&s;trong Party of <HI>Swedes,</HI> which defended them:
The Story is told thus,</P>
<P>UPON the la&s;t Day of the la&s;t Year, accord|ing
to our Account, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> made an In|cur&s;ion
in the Night time, by the Favour of the
Ice, and after they had &s;urpriz'd the advanc'd
Guards, advanc'd under the very Cannon of the
City, and committed great Di&s;orders in the Neigh|bouring
Villages, which they laid in A&s;hes,
making a great Slaughter of the Inhabitants, as al|&s;o
of &s;ome Soldiers that were Quarter'd among
them; they have al&s;o reduc'd into heaps of Rub|bi&s;h
&s;everal Hou&s;es in the Suburbs; two Sawing
Mills, &s;everal Country Habitations, notwith&s;tand|ing
that the great Guns from the City and
the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Ivanagrod,</HI> continually fir'd upon
them: That they might get more ea&s;ily into
Peoples Hou&s;es, they run about the Streets knock|ing
at the Doors, and crying out in the Language

<HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> are a coming; then upon the People open|ing
their Doors to know what-was the matter, be|lieving
them to be their Friends, the <HI>Mu&s;covites$</HI>
ru&s;h'd into their Hou&s;es and put all to the Sword,
not &s;paring either Age or Sex, that could not e|&s;cape
to the City, the Cavalry of the Garri&s;on
&s;ally'd out upon them, but were beaten back to
their very Counter&s;carp; this bloody Execution
continu'd &s;ix Hours.</P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Swedes</HI> went to wreck every where,
and the victorious <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> carried all before them;
the <HI>Czar</HI> him&s;elf pleas'd with Succe&s;s, and re&s;olv'd
to pu&s;h his good Fortune, came down in Per&s;on to
the Army, which he had ordered to be&s;iege the
City of <HI>Dorpat;</HI> the Place made a good Defence,
<PB N="134" REF="135">
but they found that the Ca&s;e was altered, the <HI>Mu&s;|covite</HI>
Engineers proceeded as regularly in their
Approaches as any other of the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI>
and attacked, and a&s;&s;ualted as boldly, and as
punctually as po&s;&s;ible: The Outworks were carried
by degrees, being well defended, and well attack'd;
In a Word, after about 27 Days open Trenches,
the Garri&s;on finding they could not hold out, and
that no relief was to be expected, beat a Parly,
and had very honourable Conditions; they &s;ur|render'd
the 26th of <HI>July,</HI> and were conducted
to <HI>Riga:</HI> Hi$ <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty appear'd on Hor&s;e|back
with his Sword in his hand, at the Head of
his Guard du Corps when the Garri&s;on march'd out,
and the Governour &s;aluting his Maje&s;ty, he was
pleas'd to return it with great Civility, and
at the Governours reque&s;t afterwards granted him
leave to go to <HI>Narva,</HI> tho' the City was then
Block'd up by his Forces under General <HI>Schein.</HI></P>
<P>THE Affairs of <HI>Poland</HI> were now come to a
&s;trange <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> and &s;uch as particularly oblig'd his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty to concern him&s;elf more than or|dinarily
with them; for the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had
&s;o far pu&s;h'd his Conque&s;t as to bring the <HI>Poles</HI> to
an Election of a new King, and carried on his
particular Re&s;entments again&s;t King Augu&s;tus, to
that extremity of Rage, as nothing could abate
it; no Treaties, no Propo&s;als, no Mediation of
foreign Powers could interpo&s;e, &s;o as to bring
him to any Terms.</P>
<P>NOW was the time for a generous Prince to engage
heartily for his Friend; I call <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>
&s;uch, becau&s;e has <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty openly profe&s;&s;es
in his Letter to the States or Republick of <HI>Poland,</HI>
that he had always entertain'd a per&s;onal Friend|&s;hip,
<PB N="135" REF="136">
for the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and now <HI>I &s;ay</HI> was the
time to &s;how it.</P>
<P>AS for the King of <HI>Poland</HI> him&s;elf, to give due
honour to his Merit, he never gave out; he fought
his Ground by Inches, he &s;truggl'd with an In|vincible
Spirit again&s;t all the Difficulties that &s;ur|rounded
him: He had a terrible Prince in the
Bowels of his Country to deal with, a factious
divided and un&s;teady People to govern, who
were neither rea&s;onable in their Demands of him,
or &s;atisfy'd when they were granted; who were
never with him till they were brib'd to it with
Money, nor faithful to him when they had it; who
when they oppos'd him, ruin'd their Country,
and when they joyn'd, ruin'd him; who had Trea|chery
enough to do him Mi&s;chief, and not Cou|rage
enough to do him Good; out of Action, al|ways
In&s;olent, in Action always Cowardly; who
when they &s;hould run, would always be for fight|ing,
and when they &s;hould fight would always
run away: Never Man of Honour ri&s;qu'd his Life,
&s;pent the Blood of a faithful Nation (his <HI>Saxons</HI>)
and &s;uch a ma&s;s of Trea&s;ure as he brought among
them, for a &s;uch a fal&s;e perver&s;e unperforming
Generation: Take the State of King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s
Ca&s;e, and the Character of his <HI>Pali&s;h</HI> Friends in
the Words of a known Writer of that Day, <HI>Thus.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER nothing di&s;courag'd the King, and
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;etting up a new King, not
only whetted his Courage, but animated tho&s;e
few <HI>Poles,</HI> that Hood by him, and encreas'd
their Number, &s;o that after the Election King <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI>
grew &s;tronger than he was before, nor would
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> have ever been able lo have
reduc'd him, had not the unlucky Defeat of a
new raised Body of <HI>Saxons</HI> open'd a Door to the
<PB N="136" REF="137">
<HI>Swedes</HI> to enter <HI>Saxony;</HI> This brought the King
<HI>entirely</HI> down, and forc'd him to &s;igh the <HI>Chart$
Blanc</HI> to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and yeild to what|ever
he demanded of him: Some particulars of
which were &s;o hard, and &s;o grating to a Man of
Spirit, as King Augu&s;tus is known to be, that the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> lo&s;t more honour in Impo&s;ing
them upon him, than the King of <HI>Poland</HI> did in
&s;ubmitting to them; the former putting them up|on
him, as matter of Triumph over his Misfor|tunes,
and the other &s;ubmitting to them purely to
prevent the intire De&s;olation of his Country, and
the ruin of his People; &s;uch were the delivering
up General <HI>Patkul,</HI> the writing a Letter to <HI>Stani&s;|la$s</HI>
giving him the Title of King, and the
re&s;toring the Trophies of his Valour, the Stan|dards
and Colours taken at the great Battle of
<HI>Cali&s;ch,</HI> where he had defeated the whole united
Army of the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Poles,</HI> and gain'd a com|pleat
Victory over them, killing above 12000 on
the &s;pot, and taking all their Cannon and Baggage,
with a great many Colours and Standards, all
which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> obliged him to re|&s;tore.</P>
<P>BUT leaving the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to make War
as never Prince before him did, Namely to gain
Victories abroad, and loo&s;e his Country at Home;
to Conquer for other People, and be Conquered
for his own; invade <HI>Saxony,</HI> which he knew he
mu&s;t quit and loo&s;e <HI>Livonia Ea&s;t-honia, Ingria,</HI> and
part of <HI>Finland,</HI> which he never &s;hall recover; if
this be per&s;uit of glory, be that fame peculiar
to him&s;elf, for he &s;eem'd to be the only Prince in
the World that ever &s;ought his Glory, at the Ex|pence
of the Lo&s;s of his Dominions, and to cut
in p$ices the worthle&s;s <HI>Poles,</HI> &s;at &s;till and let his
<PB N="137" REF="138">
own Subjects be cut in peices, and his Dominions
ravag'd and made a de&s;olation; his Subjects flying,
or being carried away, to People the Dominions of
the Conquerer.</P>
<P>BUT thus it was with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> for
at the &s;ame time that he was thus pu&s;hing the
King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and &s;pending the Strength and
Arms of <HI>Sweden,</HI> to &s;upport a new Boy-King
in <HI>Poland;</HI> he abandon'd his faithful Subjects in
<HI>Livonia,</HI> and quietly let his <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje&s;ty go on
with an unterrupted Cour&s;e of Conque&s;t, not &s;end|ing
the lea&s;t Relief to his be&s;ieged Cities, or to his
faithful Garri&s;ons, till they all fell into his Enemies
Hands; for the <HI>Czar</HI> left him not a Foot of Land
on the South Shores of the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and took from
him Countries and Provinces, equal in Wealth
and Commerce, to his whole Kingdom of <HI>Swed|land.</HI></P>
<P>IT was now that mindful of the Di&s;tre&s;s
that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> was in, and that the
Republick was like to be brought to, his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, at the &s;ame time that with an
uninterrupted Cour&s;e of Victory he rais'd his
Glory in the Conque&s;t of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Dominions,
Concern'd him&s;elf in a more particular manner
for the Intere&s;t of King <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> and be&s;ides
the numerous Armies, which upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions,
he &s;ent to his Relief, and tho' his Troops were
&s;eldom well Treated in <HI>Poland,</HI> which made them
le&s;s Serviceable than they would otherwi&s;e have
been, yet he continu'd to Succour them by all po&s;|&s;ible
Methods.</P>
<P>To this End his Maje&s;ty wrote that famous Let|ter
to the Republick; the Mea&s;ures of which had
they thought fit to have per&s;ued, they had never
<PB N="138" REF="139">
fallen a Prey as they did to the cruel Enemy, who
Triumph'd over them.</P>
<P>THIS Letter becau&s;e the Contents of it were
dictated immediately from his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's
own Mouth, and becau&s;e it &s;hows how perfectly
he was acquainted with the true Intere&s;t of <HI>Poland,</HI>
and with the Methods how their Liberty and Glo|ry
was to be retriev'd, I &s;hall give at large as it

led by the Motives of a certain inveterate Ha|tred,
and full of wicked Intention, made u&s;e

Effectually carry on the ill De&s;igns they have
contriv'd, and more &s;$afely obtain their Aim;
yet we had &s;o good an Opinion of your Equity
and Ju&s;tice, that not only we were unwilling to
give Credit to tho&s;e Reports which came from all
Parts; but al&s;o forbore to con&s;ider the &s;ame, with
the &s;erious Attention that they de&s;erved from
our Thoughts, that if that Fury and abominable
Pa&s;&s;ion had crept among&s;t &s;ome of the Orders of
your Republick, yet the number of &s;uch who think
on what they owe to God, and their Country,
and to Honour and Virtue, would much exceed the
Number of tho&s;e, who not duly weighing the
fatal Con&s;equences of tho&s;e De&s;igns, have &s;uf|fered
them&s;elves to be blinded by a depraved

al&s;o that tho&s;e great Agitations being Supported
by no Chri&s;tian Powers, would be ea&s;ily ap|peas'd
among&s;t your &s;elves; but we have after|terwards
ob&s;erv'd, and are convinc'd by un|que&s;tionable
Proofs, that that Evil was more and
more increa&s;ing and taking deeper Roots, we
thought it was our Duty more than any
body el&s;e to intervene, and expre&s;s publickly
how much we were concern'd upon hearing of &s;o

Rea&s;ons of State to Defend, and Protect the
&s;acred Maje&s;ty of Kings from oppo&s;ing with
all their might the Election of another Per&s;on,
to the prejudice of the publick Good of Chri|&s;tendom,

acquired; and rather the more, becau&s;e the be&s;t

a Theatre of War, and open a large Field
for the Plunder and Deva&s;tation of their Neigh|bouring
Nations? As to the Authors of this De|&s;ign,
and &s;uch who favour them, they will re|ceive
the puni&s;hment they ju&s;tly de&s;erve; they
will bring a blot upon them&s;elves and their Po|&s;terity,

<P>&startq;As to tho&s;e among you who have Cau&s;e to
complain, for we know very well, that the
whole mo&s;t Serene Republick is not hurried a|way

inclined for the King, we may &s;ay that 'tis cer|tain

which u&s;ually &s;way the Words and the Writings,
and from Pa&s;&s;ion and private Intere&s;t of Parties;
but although they had ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Complaint,
which does not hitherto appear, they ought for
all that to con&s;ider, that tho&s;e political Di&s;tem|pers
do not occa&s;ion &s;o much Danger to the Re|publick,
as commonly do the means which, &s;ome

into a &s;udden Flame, and the <HI>Waywod</HI> of
<HI>Po&s;en, Le&s;cin&s;ky</HI> was unlawfully elected by a

the Confederates that appear'd at the Electi|on,
and in oppo&s;ition to the Liberties, and

the fir&s;t Rank, though they had at that time
quarrel with their lawful Prince; but the Mar|&s;hal

by the Cardinal Primate, who being not only
the Head of the Clergy, but al&s;o the fir&s;t Mem|ber
of the Republick, was chiefly concern'd to
endeavour a Reconciliation between the Sub|jects

that we have Rea&s;on to think that this unlaw|ful

<PB N="159" REF="160">
of a Reconciliation between King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and
the <HI>Swedes,</HI> had embrac'd the Party of the King

of this imputation is manife&s;t by the Letter
&s;ent to the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> by the Cardinal upon
this Account, and although the King of Pru&s;&s;ia be|ing
a neutural Prince in this War, has not been

but the Per&s;ons guilty thereof was not Named,

<HI>Poland</HI> to pre&s;erve the violated Laws of the Re|publick;
we do verily believe that only &s;uch

<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> at this Time, was in no
Condition to meet &s;uch a Power, his Troops being
di&s;per&s;ed, and the King of <HI>Poland</HI> was him&s;elf in
<HI>Saxony,</HI> di&s;po&s;ing Things as his Circum&s;tances
would permit, to prevent the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s
falling into that Country. But his Army having
been defeated at the Battle of <HI>Frauen&s;tadt,</HI> it was
not po&s;&s;ible for him to rai&s;e another time enough
for the Work.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the King hearing that his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty was arrived in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> went Incogni|to
from <HI>Saxony,</HI> and by his exceeding &s;wift Riding,
having prevented any De&s;ign to intercept him,
arriv'd at <HI>Tycockzin,</HI> where the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army lay,
and there it was, that his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty let him,
&s;ee what an Army he had brought to &s;erve him.
The Sea&s;on of the Year not pre&s;enting any Op|portunity
of immediate Action, and &s;ome new
Di&s;orders having happen'd at <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="163">
took a Re&s;olution to go away Po&s;t thither, which
he did, leaving Prince <HI>Alexander Menzickoff</HI> to
Command the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army, with po&s;itive Di|rections
to obey the Orders of King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>
in all Things, as effectually as if it had been
his own.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, by his &s;udden coming
to <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> &s;urpriz'd his Enemies, as he had done
more than once before, and having made &s;ome
Examples of Ju&s;tice, and put to Death the prin|cipal
Authors of the Trea&s;on, he &s;oon return'd to
the Frontiers.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hould have taken Notice that his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, before he came into <HI>Lithuania</HI>
with this Army, had been pre&s;ent at the taking
the Town of <HI>Mittau,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Courland.</HI>
The <HI>Swedes</HI> pretended that his Troops had receiv'd
a Defeat at their fir&s;t Enterance into <HI>Courland,</HI> a
Body of 7000 <HI>Swedes</HI> under General <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> ha|ving
attack'd them with great Vigour, and yet,
even in this Action, the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> behav'd &s;o well,
that in the Accounts which the <HI>Swedes</HI> them&s;elves
publi&s;h'd of the Action, they have this Expre&s;|&s;ion;
the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Foot were cut down in Rank
and File, as they &s;tood, for tho' they faw the
Hor&s;e broken, yet not a Man of them would
&s;tir from their Po&s;t, tho' &s;urrounded by the
Enemy.</P>
<P>BUT this Victory, as the <HI>Swedes</HI> would call it,
was far from an Overthrow, and far from reliev|ing
their Cau&s;e; for about three Days after the
Battle, the <HI>Czar</HI> advanc'd with his whole Army,
and &s;urpriz'd, as I ob&s;erved above, and took
<HI>Mittau,</HI> with 900 <HI>Swedes</HI> in it Pri&s;oners of War,
with a great Magazine of Military Stores and Pro|vi&s;ion
laid up there by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> which, as was
<PB N="163" REF="164">
well ob&s;erv'd by the Writers of tho&s;e Times,
was but a very indifferent Token of their having
been beaten in a Set Battle, and 7000 of them
killed upon the Spot.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but immediately after this Bat|tle,
I might have &s;aid this Victory, for &s;uch, in|deed
it was to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians.</HI> General <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI>
retired out of the Country, and the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
General, Prince <HI>Czeremettoff,</HI> cau&s;ed the City of
<HI>Riga</HI> to be be&s;ieged in Form, which for want of
Relief, was al&s;o taken about 2 Months after, the
Garri&s;on having been reduced to the la&s;t Extre|mity.</P>
<P>IT is hard to come at the Journals of the&s;e
Sieges, no particular Account of them having
been pnbli&s;h'd in the World, but this may Sum
up that Part; that while the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> went on pu&s;hing King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> with an implaca|ble
Rage out of his Kingdom, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
over-run all the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Dominions, on the South
Side of the Gulph of <HI>Finland,</HI> and even the
Dutchy <HI>Courland</HI> it &s;elf; this would have been
called a Diver&s;ion in King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s Favour, in
any Place in the World, but here; perhaps to any
Prince in the World, but to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> it
would have been &s;o: For, who could have
&s;uppos'd, that any Prince like this, would have
pu&s;h'd on a remote Conque&s;t, in which his own
proper Dominions were &s;o little concerned, and
for the meer Satisfaction, or if you will, for the
Glory of pulling down a King, who he had already
&s;ufficiently reduced; and at the &s;ame Time, &s;uf|fer
his own Hereditary Dominions to be torn from
him, his mi&s;erable Subjects ruined and ravaged
without Succour; his &s;trong and mo&s;t Important
Towns taken from him, without relieving them;
<PB N="164" REF="165">
and his Brave Troops be beaten for want of Rein|forcement.</P>
<P>HE that can do thus, may indeed &s;ay that no
Expedition of his Enemies, by way of Diver&s;ion,
can be a Relief to tho&s;e he pu&s;hes with Revenge.
'Tis evident here, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> could
not be &s;aid to fight for Peace, but for Revenge and
Glory. For, it is evident, he might have glo|ried
in making Peace, both with <HI>Poland,</HI> and the
<HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> al&s;o, upon very Honourable Con|ditions.
But nothing would &s;erve him but redu|cing
and dethroning the One; after which, he
grew &s;o opinionate, that he fancy'd he could do
the like by the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> Nay, and his
Mini&s;ters gave it openly out, that he had re&s;ol|ved
to do it: And had Heaven &s;uffer'd him to
have carry'd on his Victory that Length, 'tis not
doubted but he would have depo&s;ed all the Kings
of the Earth, if it had been in his Power.</P>
<P>BUT we mu&s;t not anticipate our Relation of
Things, we &s;hall in the Cour&s;e of this Hi&s;tory,
bring his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty and the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
nearer together in the War, than we have done
yet, in order to this, we &s;hall begin with what
his Troops did in <HI>Poland,</HI> before the <HI>Czar</HI> came to
act in Per&s;on.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar,</HI> as I have &s;aid, had left the War in
<HI>Livonia</HI> to the Prince <HI>Czeremetoff,</HI> who managed
it with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that he beat the <HI>Swedes</HI> upon
all Occa&s;ions, and at la&s;t compleated the Conque&s;t
of <HI>Livonia,</HI> by taking the Towns of <HI>Riga, Pernau,
R$vel,</HI> and <HI>Neyen,</HI> with all the other Towns and
Forts of any Strength; Po&s;ted a &s;trong Body of
Troops in <HI>Courland,</HI> to Cover <HI>Livonia</HI> from the Re|turn
of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and then followed his Ma&s;ter,
the <HI>Czar&punc;</HI> into <HI>Lithuania.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166">
HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Troops in <HI>Livonia</HI> had
block'd up <HI>Riga,</HI> the <HI>Dunamund</HI> Schans was almo&s;t
ruined by a Di&s;a&s;ter of Fire, which taking hold
of the Powder in the Magazein, blew it all up
with a terrible Noi&s;e, 300 of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Garri&s;on
peri&s;hing in the Bla&s;t. This Accident caus'd the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> General <HI>Baver,</HI> who Commanded at <HI>Mit|tau,</HI>
to advance towards <HI>Riga</HI> with 3000 Men, to
&s;ee if he could make any Advantage of that Acci|dent,
but the Fate of that Place was not yet come.</P>
<P>WE are to under&s;tand now, that a great Coun|cil
of State had been a&s;&s;embled by King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>
at <HI>Grodno,</HI> in <HI>Lithuania&punc;</HI> where the King met &s;them,
and where they declar'd King <HI>Stani&s;taus</HI> a Traytor
and U&s;urper, and agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>
with the whole Army of the Crown, which was
to be made up to 36000 Men, and to furni&s;h Mo|ney
for their Payment.</P>
<P>THIS nettled <HI>Stani&s;taus,</HI> and he flies to the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> for Help, who drawing his Forces
together, pretended to march to attack King <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI>
and his Army, at <HI>Tycockzin:</HI> But when he
found that the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Forces had join'd with him,
he thought better of it, and marched back, not
thinking it fit to venture his Army. The Parti|culars
of this fruitle&s;s Attempt, was thus related
from the very Place, by a Per&s;on who was an Eye
Witne&s;s of it all.</P>

in Per&s;on, who&s;e Army having entered <HI>Li|thuania,</HI>
had appear'd too &s;trong to be attack'd, as

<HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, lying on the Frontiers of <HI>Sendo|mir,</HI>
12000 of which had actually joyn'd him, and
that be&s;ides this, he receiv'd daily great Succours
out of <HI>Saxony:</HI> I &s;ay, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> finding
this, re&s;olv'd upon the only effectual way he had
left to reduce the King of <HI>Poland;</HI> and this was
to enter the Electorate of <HI>Saxony</HI> with his whole
Army: The King of <HI>Poland</HI> had been aware of
this &s;ome time, and had both written to the
States of <HI>Saxony</HI> to put them&s;elves into a po&s;ture
of Defence, and had gone thither him&s;elf to &s;ee
it effectually done, but the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General <HI>Rhen&s;|child</HI>
having routed the <HI>Saxon</HI> Army at <HI>Fruaen&s;tat,</HI>
and the Country, by that means being quite
naked of Defence, the <HI>Swedes</HI> enter'd at once,
without re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>THIS immediately brought the King of <HI>Po|land</HI>
to Terms; his <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty like a true Fa|ther
of his Country, could not &s;top his Ears to the
Cries of his People, as the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had
done to tho&s;e of his mi&s;erable Subjects in <HI>Livo|nia,
Ingria</HI> and <HI>Finland;</HI> if I may &s;uppo&s;e he
heard tho&s;e Cries, for &s;ome People &s;ugge&s;ted that
Court <HI>Piper,</HI> General <HI>Steenboch,</HI> and tho&s;e Men
who managed Affairs for the Prince, conceal'd
from him the Mi&s;eries of his People: If it be
true, that they did &s;o, no doubt but the Ruin of
his Country, and the Blood of its Inhabitants lye
at their Door, &s;eeing by a ju&s;t and honourable
Peace it might have been all prevented.</P>

<P>HIS <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty re&s;olving to re&s;cue his own

<P><PB N="170" REF="171">
&startq;IT having been re&s;olved in a Council of War,
held by his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Peterkan,</HI> that the Army
Should continue their March in que&s;t of the
Enemy; the two Mare&s;chals of the Crown,
and General <HI>Brod</HI> were detach'd the 22d In|&s;tant,
with 8000 Men; and the 23d his Maje|&s;ty
and Prince <HI>Alexander Menzickoff</HI> followed
with the main Body. The 26th, the two Bodies
join'd near <HI>Szat,</HI> two Leagues from <HI>Kali&s;h,</HI>
with a Re&s;olution to expect us; thereupon his
Maje&s;ty went to take a narrow View of them,
and cau&s;ed immediately the <HI>Calmuck Tartars,</HI>
and <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> to advance under the Cannon of
<HI>Kali&s;h,</HI> to that &s;everal Skirmi&s;hes happen'd be|tween
them and the Enemy. The 28th, the
whole Army advanced within a &s;mall League
of that of the Enemy commanded by General
<HI>Mardevelt;</HI> but having &s;everal Defiles, and a
Bridge to pa&s;s before he could get at them,
his Maje&s;ty employ'd the remaining part of
that Day, in making the nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;po&s;itions
for attacking them the next, with the utmo&s;t Vi|gour.
The 29th, his Maje&s;ty march'd directly
towards the Enemy in Order of Battle, and
finding their Army drawn up likewi&s;e, behind
an Eminence, about Three in the Afternoon
gave the Signal for the Attack, by three Can|non
Shot; the Enemy an&s;wer'd by two Shots,
and came down into the Plain with their whole
Army, having intermix'd their Squadrons with
their Batallions; their Right Wing being com|pos'd
of Poli&s;h Troops, was commanded by the
Sieur <HI>Potocki,</HI> Palatine of <HI>Kiow;</HI> their Left con|&s;i&s;ting
of <HI>Lethuanians,</HI> had Prince <HI>Sapieha</HI> at
their Head; their Center was commanded by
the Swedi&s;h General <HI>Mardevelt;</HI> and the
<PB N="171" REF="172">
whole Army was cover'd with two deep Mo|ra&s;&s;es,
the Town of <HI>Kali&s;h,</HI> and a good Baracade
of Waggons; in&s;omuch, that the De&s;ign of at|tacking

in&s;uperable Difficulties; notwith&s;tanding
which, King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> per&s;i&s;ted in his Re&s;olution.
In order to put the &s;ame in execution, his Ma|je&s;ty
form'd the Center, and the two Wings of
his Army, and divided his <HI>Saxon</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
Troops; be&s;ides which, there were two Bodies
of Re&s;erve of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Forces, commanded by
the two Generals of the Crown; his Maje&s;ty
took the Command of the Left Wing upon him|&s;elf;
gave that of the Right to Prince <HI>Alexander
Menzickoff;</HI> and the Center to General <HI>Brand,</HI> or
<HI>Brod.</HI> The Ingagement began between three and
four a Clock, and his Maje&s;ty's Troops fought
with &s;o much Vigour, that the Enemy's Right
Wing was &s;oon overthrown, and driven within
the Baracade of Waggons they had near the Town
of <HI>Kali&s;h,</HI> but the re&s;t of their Army defended
them&s;elves with great ob&s;tinacy till fix at
Night; his Maje&s;ty, during the whole Action,
expos'd him&s;elf where the Fire was greate&s;t, and
charg'd the Enemy &s;everal Times in Per&s;o$,
with his Hor&s;e Guards, and &s;everal other Squa|drons;
but his Maje&s;ty having no Foot, his
Hor&s;e &s;uffer'd much by the continual Fire of
the Enemy's Infantry, and particularly of the
<HI>French</HI> Troops, and others, who, in the Action
at <HI>Frawen&s;tadt,</HI> flung down their Arms, and
went over to the <HI>Swedes.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, the
Enermy was pu&s;h'd with the utmo&s;t Vigour, and,
by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, we obtain'd a compleat
and &s;ignal Victory over them. Their Forces,

Thou&s;ands of <HI>Tarters,</HI> or <HI>Calmuck Co&s;&s;acks;</HI> &s;o

Action; and the next Morning, &s;ome Thou&s;and
<HI>Poles,</HI> who were retired within the Barricades of
Waggons, were likewi&s;e oblig'd to yield them|&s;elves
Pri&s;oners of War; among the latter,
were the Sieur <HI>Patocki,</HI> Palatine of <HI>Kiow,</HI> his
Lady and all her Children; Sieur <HI>Tarlo,</HI> Ma&s;ter
Cook of the Crown; and &s;everal other Per&s;ons of
Note; who were all di&s;arm'd, and their Hor&s;es
taken, as were al&s;o 10000 Waggons that made
up their Barricade: The <HI>Sweeds</HI> had left their
Baggage at <HI>Kali&s;h,</HI> under a Guard of 300 Men,
and after the Action, 500 Hor&s;e e&s;caped thither,
but they were all afterwards obliged to &s;ur|render
at Di&s;cretion. However, his Maje&s;ty
was &s;o generous, as to re&s;tore the Baggage to
the Officers. All the Enemy's Artillery and
Ammunition was taken. The <HI>Saxon</HI> Cavalry
took 19 Standards and Colours from the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
44 from the <HI>Poles,</HI> and 4 Pair of Kettle Drums;
the re&s;t were taken by the <HI>Poles</HI> in our Army,
and the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> This Victory is &s;o com|pleat,
that 'tis believ'd, not above 2000 of the
Enemy e&s;cap'd. All the Troops, as well <HI>Poles,</HI>
and <HI>Saxons,</HI> as <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> behaved them&s;elves
in this Action, with great Courage and Intripi|dity;
and all their re&s;pective Generals &s;igna|liz'd
them&s;elves in Emulation of each other.
Our Lo&s;s is very incon&s;iderable, for we had

<HI>Guer&s;dorf;</HI> this Victory is the more remarka|ble,

undergone great Fatiegues, by their continual
Marches and Countermarches, during the

<P>THE great Share his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's

King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> him&s;elf, till he found it nece&s;&s;ary
for Rea&s;ons of State to Cancel all the Obligations
which he ow'd to his Supporters, and Con&s;equent|ly
to le&s;&s;en the Merit of the Support, which they
had given him; but as he own'd to have in his

Army 9000 <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Soldiers, I mean Regular

<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Subjects, who in their way did
him very good Service on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT now we come to the Tran&s;actions of King
<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s Life, which are the meane&s;t part of his
Hi&s;tory, Namely, that of abandoning the Crown
of <HI>Poland,</HI> quitting his Alliance with the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;+covy,</HI>
who had never for&s;aken him in his greate&s;t
Di&s;tre&s;s, and yielding to the lowe&s;t Steps, which
his in&s;ulting Enemies could put upon him.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;t that the Plenipotentiaries
on either Side, had &s;ign'd the Treaty at <HI>Alt Ran|&s;tadt,</HI>
nay, the Peace was concluded and &s;ign'd
four Days before the Battle of <HI>Kali&s;h</HI> was fought;
otherwi&s;e, perhaps King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> would have
ventur'd with his victorious Army to have march'd
directly again&s;t the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who tho' they were
indeed in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the open Country of the
<HI>Electorate,</HI> yet had no fortify'd Place in their Hands,
nor above 15 or 16000 Men in their Army, where|as
the King of <HI>Poland</HI> could in le&s;s than 12 Days
have had 60000 Men in his Army, be&s;ides what
Troops he had in <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it was too late, and King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> made
it a point of Honour to &s;tand to the Agreement
his Plenipotentiaries had made, however di&s;hon|ourable
it might be; &s;o he laid down his Arms at
once, and gave up the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> and all
his Friend, and Intere&s;t there to the Mercy of a Mer|cenary,
who the <HI>Poles</HI> di&s;pis'd mo&s;t heartily, tho'
many of them were oblig'd to call him King, and
this was the Condition of things when his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty return'd to his Army in <HI>Lithuania.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="176">

Liberty of their Country again&s;t the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and
to this purpo&s;e he publi&s;h'd a Declaration, or
Memorial to the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nobility, and having re|ceiv'd
a formal Notification of the Treaty con|cluded

The Primate of the Kingdom An&s;wered, in the

Thanks to the <HI>Czar</HI> for his Affection and Friend|&s;hip,

as the Glory of their Nation, and
the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Conditon of their Country re|quired

of the Con&s;ecration of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cujavia</HI>
perform'd in the Cathedral, and pre&s;ented that

the 21&s;t, there was a long Conference
between the Mini&s;ters of that Prince, and the
Council of <HI>Poland;</HI> but the Re&s;olutions taken
therein were kept very private: His Maje&s;ty

<P>The following Letter was al&s;o written by the
<HI>Czar</HI> to the great General, and dated from <HI>Zolkiew</HI>
the 7th of <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> having by Force and
Management, compa&s;s'd his De&s;ign again&s;t King
<HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> &s;eeks with no lefs Cunning to gain his
Ends of us and the Republick, and to render Fruitle&s;s
our good Di&s;po&s;itions to maintain the common Intere&s;t.
In this View, his Mini&s;ters in all foreign Courts in&s;i|nuate,
that he is treating of a Peace &s;eparately with
us. We do not deny, that (when) formerly, at <HI>Seoli|za,</HI>
&s;everal Mini&s;ters of foreign Potentates, &s;ounded
our Inclination to Peace; we intimated, that out of
Chri&s;tian Duty, and to &s;pare the Effu&s;ion of Blood,
we &s;hould always be ready to hearken to all Propo&s;tions
of Peace which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;hould offer,
but on Condition, that &s;uch Peace &s;hould be negotiated
openly, and with the Con&s;ent and Participation of
the Republick, and concluded by Commi&s;&s;ioners
appointed by all the Nations concern'd. We never did,
or &s;hall entertain any Thoughts of treating of Peace
&s;ecretly, by the Intervention of any foreign Courts;
prefering to all Intere&s;t and Advantage, the Reputa|tion,
Honour, and Inviolable good Faith of a Mo|narch,
in the &s;trict Ob&s;ervation of all his Alliances.
We therefore, a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hip, that we have not
yet enter'd into any Manner of Negotiation of Peace
with <HI>Sweden,</HI> nor, for the future, will enter into any,
otherwi&s;e than we have already declared, with the
Participation and Con&s;ent of the E&s;tates of the Re|publick;
being ab&s;olutely determin'd to keep inviolably
<PB N="180" REF="181">
the Alliance and Guarantee we are ingaged in with
the Republick.</P>
<P>IN Pur&s;uit of the <HI>Czar's</HI> Re&s;olutions to a&s;&s;i&s;t
the <HI>Poles,</HI> we find that his Maje&s;ty's Troops were
very numerous in <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>THE Body of <HI>Mu&s;covits</HI> in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of
18000 Men, and were augmented con&s;iderably;
the City of <HI>Dantzick</HI> were not a little alarm'd at
it, e&s;pecially &s;ince they receiv'd a threatning Let|ter
from the <HI>Czar</HI> on Account of their acknow|ledging
<HI>Stani&s;laus.</HI> The Body of <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> about
<HI>Thorn</HI> were &s;o &s;trong, that they oblig'd Prince
<HI>Lubomir&s;ky</HI> to retire with his Troops into great
<HI>Poland.</HI> The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> al&s;o form'd another Bo|dy
near <HI>Cali&s;h,</HI> making near 30000 Men; and a
Fourth about <HI>Gue&s;na.</HI> During the&s;e things the
<HI>Czar</HI> &s;eeing the <HI>Poles</HI> un&s;teady in their Re&s;olutions,
and di&s;puting Trifles with their be&s;t Friends, went
him&s;elf in Per&s;on to the great Council of Senators,
which were adjourn'd from <HI>Lemberg,</HI> and met at
<HI>Lublin;</HI> where is <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty arrived the 20th
of <HI>May,</HI> 1707, with a Guard of 3000 Dragoons.
The Senators had all agreed as above, that up|on
the King of <HI>Poland</HI>'s having abdicated the
Crown, they were in a State of <HI>Interregnum,</HI> and
that the Throne was vacant; but could never be
brought to fill up the Vacancy, and elect a new
King, which his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty ju&s;tly thought
was the only way to engage them heartily, &s;o
that they might be depended on.</P>
<P>BUT they put it always off, alledging that
King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had not &s;ignified his Re&s;olution of
abandoning the Crown to them in Particular, and
therefore they ought to &s;end a Deputation to
<PB N="181" REF="182">
him, to have his la&s;t An&s;wer from his own
Mouth.</P>
<P>THIS the <HI>Czar</HI> took for gro&s;s Triffling with
him, and &s;uch indeed it was; for they had their
Articles of Peace between the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> and
the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> publi&s;h'd by the &s;aid two
King's re&s;pectively, and the Letter which the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> oblig'd the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to
write to King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> owning him for King of
<HI>Poland,</HI> all the&s;e were before them, and yet they
made Excu&s;es to put off a new Election of a
King.</P>
<P>THEY were indeed, all of them willing to have
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty to advance with his Army,
and propo&s;ed to concert Mea&s;ures to act again&s;t
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> with joint Forces, and Endea|vour
to bring the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to a deci&s;ive
Battle; which his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was willing
enough to do, as &s;oon as a new King &s;hould be
nam'd, but did not think any other Step le&s;s
than that, could &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ure him of
the Fidelity and Steadine&s;s of the <HI>Poles,</HI> who in
Ca&s;e of a Battle, he knew well enough might
have an Opportunity to make their Peace at his
Maje&s;ty's Expence; and indeed, tho&s;e Uncer|tainties
produced &s;uch a general Di&s;ta&s;te, and
gave &s;uch a plain Ground of Mi&s;tru&s;t, that they,
the <HI>Poles,</HI> only &s;ought a Delay, and to &s;ee what
Mea&s;ures the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> would take, or whe|ther
he re&s;olved to bring his Army again into
<HI>Poland,</HI> or not, that they might have Time to
take up with the Stronge&s;t; that his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty,
from this Time, begun to &s;ee plainly, he
had nothing but his own Power to depend upon;
and that the <HI>Poles</HI> were not to be tru&s;ted; and
this brought in the End, all the Con&s;ultations,
<PB N="182" REF="183">
Confederacies and Pretences of Defending the
Liberties of <HI>Poland</HI> to nothing, and ended as &s;uch
generally do, in their falling all into the Hands
of their Enemies; and being oblig'd to &s;ubmit to
King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> as we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew.</P>
<P>BUT his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty who knew them too
well, to be drawn into any Snare by them;
acted an open, plain, and fair Part with them;
and let them know, that &s;ince they would not do
their Duty, and were not mov'd either by their
pre&s;ent or future Intere&s;t, he would take Care
to depend upon him&s;elf only, and take &s;uch
Mea&s;ures as he &s;hould think fit. But whereas
their famous Champion <HI>Smegielski,</HI> who had done
&s;o many gallant Exploits again&s;t the <HI>Swedes</HI> in the
Cau&s;e of King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> had now made his Peace,
and was gone over to <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> and had commit|ted
&s;ome Ho&s;tilities again&s;t the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians:</HI> The <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ian</HI>
General caus'd him to be hang'd in Effigie,
as a Traytor to his Country, and put a Reward
upon his Head, to any who &s;hould bring him in alive or dead.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame Time, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;eeing
him&s;elf thus u&s;ed, by King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> even ju&s;t
after his Troops had obtain'd a great Victory for
him, the &s;aid King <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> and that notwith|&s;tanding
all this, he had not only abandon'd his
Confederacy or Alliances with his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje|&s;ty,
but had joyn'd his Enemy the King of <HI>Swe|den,</HI>
and obliged him&s;elf to act Con$rary to the
Intere&s;t he had e&s;pou&s;ed; and al&s;o that King <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI>
had &s;ent Letters and Memorials to <HI>England,</HI>
to <HI>Holland,</HI> and other Places, to excu&s;e and palli|ate
the Treachery of his Friend&s;hip. I &s;ay, &s;ee|ing
him&s;elf thus u&s;ed by King <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> his <HI>Czar|i&s;h</HI>

<P>ALTHOUGH 'tis not unknown to your Royal

with the Services we have done King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI>
from his fir&s;t Election to the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI>
having by our powerful Endeavours for the common
Benefit of that Crown, hindered the Prince of <HI>Con|ti,</HI>
who had been cho&s;en before by part of the Repub|lick
from taking po&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and even &s;ent a nu|merous
Army again&s;t the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI>'s Party, for
the u&s;e and Service of tho&s;e Senators, that &s;ided with
King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> before any League had been conclud|ded
with him, or his Enterance into <HI>Poland;</HI> the
Army was immediately upon his arrival put under his
command, that he might be able to puni&s;h his Enemies,
be&s;ides which we threatned the contrary Party with
Fire and Sword; upon Apprehen&s;ion hereof, many
were forced to acknowledge him, and &s;o by our Assi|&s;tance
he was firmly Settled upon the Throne; after|wards
by his particular Intreaties, and a Me&s;&s;age by
General <HI>Carlowitz</HI> in the Year 1700, we concluded
with him an Alliance again&s;t the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
in which there was no Sub&s;idies of Money promi&s;ed
him, moreover many Affronts and Injuries having
<PB N="184" REF="185">
been done us at the beginning of the War by the Crown
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> we were prevail'd with by the earne&s;t
Sollicitations of his Mini&s;ter General <HI>Langa</HI> in an
unproper Sea&s;on, it being the latter End of Autumn
for his Relief, and to make the Enemy turn their
Arms again&s;t us, to begin to attack <HI>Narva,</HI> and then
his Forces, contrary to his Promi&s;e, leaving ours in
Action, went into Quarters in <HI>Poland,</HI> and <HI>Cour|land,</HI>
on which occa&s;ion our Forces &s;uffer'd no &s;mall
Lo&s;s, notwith&s;tanding which, a League being renewed
with him at <HI>Bir&s;a,</HI> in 1701, not a &s;mall Sum of Mo|ney
was Lent him, be&s;ides which, we a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with
20000 Foot, neverthele&s;s this &s;ignified nothing, nor
were our Arms made u&s;e of according to the Treaty,
but by the Intrigues of the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>du
Heiron,</HI> to whom contrary to our Agreement and
Per&s;onal Prote&s;tations confirm'd by us, full power
was at that time given to Treat about a &s;eparate
Peace, tho&s;e our Forces without nece&s;&s;ity were greatly
fatigued and the Enemy permitted to pa&s;s the <HI>Dwina,</HI>
di&s;mi&s;s'd without being &s;upplied with Provi&s;ions, du|ring
their March, for which the &s;aid King received
Money from us, which cau&s;ed great Numbers of
them to peri&s;h, and others to De&s;ert: Notwith|standing
all this, upon his repeated A&s;&s;urance, and
Me&s;&s;ages, we renewed a League with him in the Year
1703, and promi&s;ed 300000 Rubles for the u&s;e of
his Forces, and 12000 Foot to be maintain'd at our
own Charges, which we faithfully perform'd; and al|though
the Sub&s;ides, and Auxilliaries were not then
&s;pecified in that Treaty, nor whether the &s;ame &s;hould
be given Yearly, yet we &s;ent him every Year no le&s;s
then the abovementioned Sum, not reckoning other im|men&s;e
Charges, we were at, for the pre&s;erving the
Republick in his Intere&s;t; but in&s;tead of imploying the
Forces again&s;t the Enemy, he made them March to
<PB N="185" REF="186">
and fro in <HI>Poland,</HI> whereby they were very much fa|tigued;
and afterwards parting from them without
any occa&s;ion, be permitted them to be driven into <HI>Sax|ony,</HI>
together with the <HI>Saxons,</HI> whereby without any
nece&s;&s;ity half of them were unaccountably lo&s;t, and
the re&s;t were forced to die with Hunger; and altho'
free Winter Quarters were promis'd them in the
Treaty, yet on the contrary, 'twas forbidden to sup|ply
them with Bread in their Quarters: Upon which
our Mini&s;ter extraordinary, <HI>Van Patkul,</HI> then re|&s;iding
at his Court, and chief General of tho&s;e Forces,
in order to pre&s;erve them from utter and certain
Ruin, agreed with the Emperor's Mini&s;ters to put
them into his imperial Maje&s;ty's Service, for which
by the Sugge&s;tions of the &s;aid King's wicked and trea|cherous
<HI>Saxon</HI> Mini&s;ters, he was put under Arre&s;t
contrary to the Law of Nations, and without our
con&s;ent, was ca&s;t like a Traytor into a loath&s;ome Pri|son,

his Throne, and defend the Republick of <HI>Poland</HI> a|gainst
the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Forces, to leave all our Armies
to Act for his Intere&s;t; and at the de&s;ire of the Re|publick
by their extraordinary Emba&s;&s;y to March
with all our Forces into <HI>Poland,</HI> where they were ob|lig'd
to be maintain'd to this Day to our great Charge
in own Pay; yet notwith&s;tanding all this, his Generals
at his going out of <HI>Saxony,</HI> with our and their Troops,
&s;uffered them&s;elves, not without &s;u&s;picion of Treache|ry,
to be beaten without any Re&s;i&s;tance; and our
Forces were &s;o De&s;erted, that only 1600 of them re|mained,
and the&s;e with much a-do &s;aved them&s;elves,

without regarding the intolerable Fal&s;hoods of the &s;aid

made with us, his impri&s;oning our Mini&s;ter, and vio|lating

Count <HI>Koningmark,</HI> and afterwards in Writing by
their Secretary <HI>Nemitz</HI> and <HI>Figg&s;tone</HI> from the
beginning of the War, and after their enterance into
<HI>Saxony,</HI> of which Tran&s;actions we had Notice given
us by &s;everal of our faithful Friends, and notwith|standing
we had tho&s;e Treaties in our Hands, yet we
did not leave to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, both with our Forces and
Money; and in the la&s;t Compaign, though the Sea&s;ou
of the Year was &s;o far advanced, it being the latter
End of Autum, yet being de&s;ir'd to draw the Ene|my
back, and harra&s;s his Army, we &s;ent our Caval|ry
under the command of our General Prince <HI>Men|zikoff</HI>
to join him, and his <HI>Saxon</HI> and <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Forces,
who Marching towards <HI>Cali&s;h,</HI> met with the <HI>Swe|di&s;h</HI>
General <HI>Mardefelt,</HI> and the <HI>Poles</HI> of the con|trary
Party under the command of the <HI>Waywode</HI> of
<HI>Kiow,</HI> and by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the mo&s;t High, entirely
defeated them, and took their chief General and ma|ny
other inferior Officers, and Soldiers, Pri&s;oners of
war, whereby all great <HI>Poland</HI> was brought under his
Obedience; after this, being fully &s;upplyed with all
Nece&s;&s;aries, we de&s;$gn'd, by the Help of the mo&s;t High,
to act still in his Defence, which was begun with the
Action at <HI>Wyburg</HI> in <HI>Finland,</HI> and did expect many
good Con&s;equences from that Defeat, and rely'd on
a strict Ob&s;ervance of the Treaty, pur&s;uant to the <HI>A&s;&s;ur</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="188">
ances we had receiv'd from him in two Letters,
written &s;ince the Battle, the fir&s;t dated the 31&s;t. of
<HI>October,</HI> and the &s;econd the 20th of <HI>November;</HI>
but &s;aw at fir&s;t, that he begun to take away from our
&s;aid General, Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> the General Officers,
and other Pri&s;oners we had taken, giving his Royal
Word, and many A&s;&s;urances, that he either would
exchange them for our Generals and other Officers,
detain'd in <HI>Sweden;</HI> for the Performance whereof,
General <HI>Mardefelt,</HI> with the Re&s;t of the Officers,

that he would re&s;tore the &s;aid Pri&s;oners into

concluded a di&s;honourable Peace with the King of <HI>Swe|den,</HI>

Security, in Return of the innumerable Favours done
him by us; but what &s;hows his Ingratitude to the
highe&s;t Degree, is, that the Peace was confirm' by him
many Days before the Battle. After which, by his
Letters, he gave his earne&s;t A&s;&s;urances of his firm
Adherence to the Treaty; the Incon&s;tancy of his Pro|mi&s;es,
Non-performance of the League, and Forgetful|ne&s;s

have performed by our Mini&s;ters, had we not been de|luded&punc;
as we have made it appear, by the the fre&s;h A&s;&s;u|rance
he &s;ent us by Major General <HI>Goltz,</HI> who among
many other fal&s;e A&s;&s;urances of Friend&s;hip engaged for
the Performance of the League, and &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured
us, that our Mini&s;ter &s;hould never be deliver'd up,
and that in Ca&s;e, it &s;hould come to the la&s;t Extreme|ly,
King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> &s;hould either &s;et him privately
at Liberty, or detain him in <HI>Koning&s;tein</HI> 'till the De|parture
of the <HI>Swedes;</HI> and afterwards, deliver him
<PB N="189" REF="190">
into our Hands. But we have &s;ince, with Wonder,
and bitter Grief under&s;tood, that that Prince fore|going
his Honour, has deliver'd up our innocent pub|lick
Mini&s;ter, contrary to the Law of Nations, and
even Cu&s;toms of <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and without the Fear of
God, into the Hands of his Enemies. For which
Rea&s;on, we have the rather thought fit to acquaint
your Maje&s;ty with all the Premi&s;es; and in a friendly
and brotherly Manner, to defire, that you would be
plea&s;ed, by your good Offices, to procure the Liberty
of our &s;aid Mini&s;ter, <HI>Van Patkul,</HI> or at lea&s;t, that
he may be u&s;ed by the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as our Mini|&s;ter,
and not as his Subject, which we are confident,
his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty will grant, at your Royal Ma|je&s;ty's
De&s;ire, whereby he will gain, with all the
World, the Name of a magnanimous Monarch, in|stead
of giving an Example of &s;o wicked and barbarous
an Action. But, if on the Contrary, <HI>Van Patkul</HI>
be hardly dealt with, and not u&s;ed as our Mini&s;ter,
we &s;hall be forced to &s;eek Opportunities to return the
like U&s;age. Tru&s;ting that in our ju&s;t Cau&s;e, we &s;hall

<P>THIS Letter is too &s;ignificant, and the Sub&s;i&s;t|tance
of it of too much Weight, to be pa&s;s'd over,
it being an Abridgement of the Conduct of his
<HI>Czarish</HI> Maje&s;ty, in Aid of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI>
and of his treacherous Return, and al&s;o a kind
of Summary of the State of Things between
them at that Time.</P>
<P>THERE are two Ca&s;es mention'd in this Le|tter,
which have not yet been &s;poken to; the one
is, That of the 1600 <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> who had been put
into the Service of the Confederates in the Em|pire,
and were acting upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> as Part of
King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s Quota to the grand Alliance a|gainst
<HI>France;</HI> and the other, is that of General
<HI>Patkull,</HI> who the <HI>Czar</HI> here declares to be his Mini|&s;ter
and Amba&s;&s;tador to King <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> certain it
is, that King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> yielded both the&s;e Points to
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> that is to &s;ay, as far as lay
in his Power; he gave up the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Troops up|on
the <HI>Rhine</HI> to the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> but the
Emperor, who had more Humanity and Honour,
than to be a Party to &s;o di&s;honourable an Action,
&s;tood out &s;o long, 'till the &s;aid Regiments had
Opportunity to retire from thence, and to di&s;|band,
and by &s;mall Parties to pa&s;s through the
Imperial Countries into <HI>Poland,</HI> and &s;o to their
own Country. But as for General <HI>Patkull,</HI> he de|liver'd
him up to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who, deaf
to all Interce&s;&s;ion, and not regarding him as a
Publick Mini&s;ter, but as a Traytor, cau&s;ed him
without Mercy, to be put to Death, by breaking
him a-live, and that with &s;ome extraordinary Marks
of Cruelty, &s;uch as particularly cau&s;ing his own
Nephew, an Officer then in the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s
Service, to be the Per&s;on to &s;ee the Execution
<PB N="192" REF="193">
perform'd, to the A&s;toni&s;hment and Horror of all
that heard it.</P>
<P>BUT to return to his <HI>Czarish</HI> Maje&s;ty, he now
found that nothing was to be done with the <HI>Poles,</HI>
and that he mu&s;t re&s;olve to &s;tand upon his own
Feet, again&s;t the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who having
encrea&s;ed his Army, in <HI>Saxony</HI> to 50000 Men, by
rai&s;ing Men almo&s;t over the whole Empire, was
in Motion towards <HI>Poland.</HI> I &s;ay, finding this, his
Maje&s;ty leaving 40000 Hor&s;e in <HI>Poland,</HI> to Coun|tenance
the <HI>Poles</HI> if they would be &s;teady, and
di&s;charge them&s;elves as was their Duty: Went
him&s;elf into <HI>Lithuania,</HI> to draw his Forces toge|ther
there, in order to be in a Condition to Face
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or, withdraw the re&s;t of his
Troops, as he &s;hould find Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden</HI> left <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Begin|ing
of <HI>September,</HI> to the great Joy of the Poor
People there, who had been terribly impoveri&s;h'd
by their long Stay in the Country. They ad|vanced
by long Marches through <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> and came
the 10th of October, to Ca&s;imir in <HI>Poland,</HI> where
the barbarous Execution of Count <HI>Patkull,</HI> above|mention'd,
was perform'd, being the fir&s;t Town
they halted at, on their entering <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty being, as I have &s;aid, gone
into <HI>Lithuania,</HI> had his head Quarters at <HI>Wilda;</HI>
before the withdrawing his Army, he ordered the
Lands of the <HI>$alatines,</HI> in the Interc&s;t of the U|&s;urper
<HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> to be laid Wa&s;te, which his Ene|mies
repre&s;ented as a mighty Injury; altho' he
therein only follow'd the Example of the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
who had &s;o often done the like in an extraordina|ry
manner, to the Lands and E&s;tates of the No|bility
who adheard to the Intere&s;t of their Coun|try.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="194">
THIS was the Ca&s;e wherein the King of <HI>Swe|den</HI>'s
Party pretended the <HI>Czar</HI> had rifled the Seats
of the Nobility in <HI>Poland,</HI> and carry'd away the
Pictures, Statues, Orange Trees, &amp;c. into <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
as al&s;o &s;everal Extraordinary Libraries with
many valuable Manuf&s;cripts, and other Curio&s;ities,
or Rarities in Nature and of Art, part of which,
if it were &s;o, was relative only to the Hou&s;es of
his Enemies, which by the Laws of War he had
Right to, they being now in Arms again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THE Diet or A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Lublin,</HI> continued
&s;ome time longer, and &s;eem'd to adhere to their
former Re&s;olutions, and to &s;upport their Liber|ties,
again&s;t King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> and the <HI>Swedes,</HI> but
as the <HI>Czar</HI> had no Confidence in them, &s;o indeed,
he had no Rea&s;on, as the Event &s;hew'd after|wards;
for the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> advancing, they
all &s;eparated and di&s;appear'd, leaving his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty to &s;tand by him&s;elf, as it may be &s;aid,
in the War with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> which how
well he was able to do, and how Ill they de|&s;erv'd
it of him, will &s;oon appear in the Con&s;e|quence
of the Story.</P>
<P>NOT that they ever fell in heartily with the
King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or with <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> which made
the Revolution which follow'd, the more ea&s;ie to
the King of <HI>Poland.</HI> But the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
coming with &s;o formidable a Power, back into
<HI>Poland,</HI> and bending the fir&s;t of his March towards
<HI>Thorn,</HI> and the Towns on the lower <HI>Vi&s;tula;</HI> it
was no more Que&s;tion'd for &s;ome Time, but that
his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, Would in the fir&s;t Place, clear
the Country of all King <HI>Sani&s;laus</HI>'s Enemies, and
u&s;e them with the uttmo&s;t Severity.</P>
<P>BUT the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who&s;e dark Hour&s;
were ju&s;t now begining, and who, as &s;ome have
<PB N="194" REF="195">
ob&s;erv'd, &s;carce ever took one right Step, after
his coming from <HI>Saxony,</HI> but delay'd his Proceed|ings
either one Way or other, for near three
Months, hovering on that Side of <HI>Poland</HI> next the
Borders of <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> 'till he had brought the Empe|ror
to Execute fully a Treaty which had been
made between them, in the behalf of the Pro|te&s;tants
of <HI>Sile&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>AND indeed, he was oblig'd to &s;tay thus long
about <HI>Po&s;en,</HI> and <HI>Cali&s;h,</HI> and tho&s;e Parts, to lay
up Magazins, and Stores of Provi&s;ions for his
Army; for the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> had ruined the Country
with a De&s;igns to render it difficult to him to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t,
and it had the de&s;ired Effect; for after he be|gun
to extend him&s;elf, there was no Forrage to be
found, &s;ufficient to &s;upply his Army on any con|&s;iderable
Occa&s;ion, and this made the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> lye &s;till, till the Month of <HI>February</HI> at
lea&s;t.</P>
<P>DURING all this Time, things hung in &s;u&s;pen&s;e
between the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the <HI>Czar</HI> of
<HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> &s;everal Powers, and Princes, &s;ought to
mediate a Peace between his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty and
the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> Nor was the <HI>Czar</HI> aver&s;e to
a Peace, upon equitable and ju&s;t Conditions; but
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> breathed nothing but War
and declar'd or the World was &s;o unju&s;t as to
publi&s;h it in his Name, that nothing &s;hould &s;ati&s;|fy
him now, but dethroning the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
as he had dethron'd the King of <HI>Poland;</HI> So that
the <HI>Czar</HI> might be truly &s;aid to fight for his
Crown, as he had fought before for his Friend
the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and for the Peace of the
Republick.</P>
<P>IN Pe$&s;uance of this wicked Principle of Re|venge,
he turn'd his Arms froom <HI>Poland,</HI> not yet
<PB N="195" REF="196">
&s;ubdued, and left his new pretended King,
to &s;trugle with a half reduced Nobility, and a di|vided
Nation, and profe&s;s'd to make War again&s;t
neither &s;mall nor great, but again&s;t his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty in Per&s;on.</P>
<P>THIS chymerical Piece of Per&s;onality in War,
drew is <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, otherwi&s;e a mo&s;t gallant
and experienc'd Prince, into &s;o many wild and
de&s;perate Undertakings, as have never been heard
of before; and into &s;uch Mi&s;takes, to &s;ay no
wor&s;e of them, as never any General of an Army
run into, and which at la&s;t ended in his utter Ruin,
and overthrow, as will pre&s;ently appear.</P>
<P>His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, di&s;pi&s;ing the Threatening
or <HI>Ga&s;conade</HI> of Depo&s;ing him; but not at all Di&s;|pi&s;ing,
either the Per&s;on or Armies of the King
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> had no more to do than to draw off his
Armies from <HI>Poland,</HI> keep his new Conque&s;ts well
guarded, and provided, and bring all his Forces
into &s;uch po&s;ts, as that he might &s;oone&s;t draw to|gether
his Power, when he &s;aw where the Cloud
would break; wait to &s;ee which Way this new In|vader
would go about this great Work of entering
the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empire, in order to bring to pa&s;s the
Revolution he had projected.</P>
<P>IT was with &s;ome Rea&s;on that his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty
thought the fir&s;t Step that the King of <HI>Swe|den</HI>
would take, would be to march into <HI>Livonia,</HI>
and there endeavour to recover what he had lo&s;t;
retrieve the ruin'd Condition of that flouri&s;hing
Country, and like a true Father thereof, re&s;tore
Peace to his People. But far from this, he found
that on a &s;uddain, his Enemy turn'd his Face to
the <HI>South,</HI> or rather to the <HI>South Ea&s;t,</HI> and bent his
Marches really towards his Maje&s;ty's Dominions.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="197">
THEN it was, that the <HI>Czar,</HI> who early pene|trated
into the De&s;ign; fore&s;aw, that &s;ome Trea|chery
mu&s;t be form'd among the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> of the
<HI>Ukrain,</HI> and that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had held
&s;ome private Corre&s;pondences with the Traytor
<HI>Maz$ppa,</HI> General of that fal&s;e and fickle People:
And this was the more probable, becau&s;e it was
the only View that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> could
have on that Side: The <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Cira&s;&s;ia,</HI> and all
that Side of the Country, were too remote for
any &s;uch Attempt, nor would it be po&s;&s;ible for the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to penetrate into <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> any
o$ her Way, the Frontiers lying de&s;olate for
&s;o long a Way before he could come to the inha|bited
fruitful Part of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> that it would be
impo&s;&s;ible for an Army to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, to find For|riage
for their Hor&s;es, and Food for their Men,
and that the carrying it with them for &s;o long a
March, would be as Impracticable, as the other
would be Impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Ukrain,</HI> a fruitful and populous Coun|try
could it be brought into a Revolt, as the
<HI>Swedes</HI> had flatter'd them&s;elves, or as &s;ome had
brought them to believe it would, might indeed,
have given him an Inlet into the Heart of the
Country, and have furni&s;h'd them with Carriages
and H$re&s;es for carrying their Provi&s;ions, if the
<HI>Czar</HI> &s;hould lay wa&s;te the Enterance into his
Dominions, as they might conclude would be
done.</P>
<P>WITH this View, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> began
the de&s;perate undertaking, and marching thro'
the whole Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> pa&s;t the <HI>Bori&s;the|nes,</HI>
and advanc'd directly towards the <HI>Ukra|nia</HI>
by long and Fateaguing Marches, having
42000 Men compleat in his Army, which a fine
<PB N="197" REF="198">
Train of Artillery, and &s;uch an infinite Store
of Ammunition and other millitary Things, as
al&s;o of Provisions and Baggage as took up 11000
Waggons to carry after them, be&s;ides Mules and
Baggage Hor&s;es innumerable, and be&s;ides an Army
of 16000 Men, under the Command o$ Genral
<HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> who his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty left to come af|ter
him, with another Train of Artillery, and 7000
Waggons of Amunition and Warlike Stores more.</P>
<P>NOW his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty knew his Bu&s;ine&s;s;
the Field was mark'd out for him, and he knew
where to expect his Enemy. Now he &s;aw where
this gathering Cloud would break, and where the
Storm would fall; and he had no more to do but
to follow and provide for his Defence.</P>
<P>HE did not however, abandon all Hopes from
the confederate States of <HI>Poland,</HI> or their A&s;&s;em|bly
at <HI>War&s;aw,</HI> tho' he cea&s;ed to depend upon their
A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but as he knew the Di&s;po&s;ition of the
<HI>Poles</HI> perfectly well, he knew that tho' they
would not go on in the Path that he propo&s;ed,
that is to &s;ay, to bring Things to a Point, and
&s;et up another King; which, after they had de|clar'd,
and publi&s;h'd an <HI>Interregnum,</HI> one would
have thought they &s;hould not have &s;tuck at; yet,
that they had gone too far, to go back again to
King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> and that at lea&s;t they would create
him a great deal of Trouble, and employ a great
many of his Troops, to prevent him joyning with
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and this happen'd exactly as
the <HI>Czar</HI> fore&s;aw it would.</P>
<P>UPON this Foot, I &s;ay, he did not break with
them, and leave them abruptly, and entirely to
them&s;elves, which had been to have them all
torn in Pieces by the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or to have
forc'd them to go in at once to King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI>
and to joyn him again&s;t his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's
<PB N="198" REF="199">
Armies. But to prevent either of the&s;e Extreams,
the <HI>Czar,</HI> tho' he retir'd with the Gro&s;s of his
Army, to his own Frontiers; and as I have &s;aid,
prepar'd to defend him&s;elf, yet he left a Body of
Troops with them, to encourage, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them,
and manag'd them &s;o well, that they could ne|ver
be brought to joyn King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> or fall in|to
his Mea&s;ures, and Intere&s;t, to the la&s;t, no not
when the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had 60000 Men in the
Bowels of their Country.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> it has
been ob&s;erv'd by &s;ome Writers, and &s;uch too, as
have made the be&s;t Judgement of tho&s;e Things,
that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> never took one pro&s;pe|rous
Step, nor did any Thing thrive that he un|dertook,
after the cruel Execution of Count <HI>Pat|kull,</HI>
nor after his unju&s;t and per&s;onal War again&s;t
the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>'s Crown: I mean his declar'd
Re&s;olution, to depo&s;e and dethrone his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty; a Thing the World laugh'd at, and
which was in it&s;elf, con&s;idering the numerous
Armies the <HI>Czar</HI> had then on Foot, really ridicu|lous.
But this is by the Way.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden</HI> having layn &s;till, in the
<HI>le&s;&s;er Poland,</HI> as above, near 3 Months, and ha|ving
con&s;ulted with his Generals, and re&s;olv'd
what Cour&s;e to &s;teer, what Forces to take with
him, and what Armies the Generals &s;hould Com|mand
in his Ab&s;ence, &s;et forward the 8th of <HI>March</HI>
on his re&s;olv'd Expedition into <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI></P>
<P>THE Troops he took with him, were about
forty two Thou&s;and Men, all well di&s;ciplin'd cho|&s;en
Men, and he left General <HI>Rhen&s;child</HI> Field
M$r$&s;cha, and Governor of <HI>Livonia</HI> as above,
with 15000 Men more, and a &s;econd Train of
Artillery, with 6000 Waggons Loaden with
<PB N="199" REF="200">
Amunition, and Military Stores, and Provi&s;ions,
to follow him.</P>
<P>THIS was indeed, a formidable Force, and
might have been more &s;uitable to the Under|taking,
had he been actually in the Field of
Action, that is to &s;ay, had he been in the inha|bited
populous Part of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and had not a va&s;t
unpeopled wa&s;ted Country to march through,
and which the <HI>Czar</HI> had on purpo&s;e &s;trip'd of all
po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting him, and that he mu&s;t
carry every Mouthful of Provi&s;ions with him,
as well Forrage for his Hor&s;e, as Bread for his
Men.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, about <HI>March,</HI> the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
a Prince re&s;olute and unalterable in his Underta|kings,
when once his Councils were concluded,
began his March, as I have &s;aid, for <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and
pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Vi&s;tula,</HI> fir&s;t advanced to wards <HI>Lithua|nia:</HI>
HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had left a Body of 3000
Hor&s;e, and 22000 Foot, to guard the Pa&s;&s;ages of
the <HI>Vi&s;tulla,</HI> again&s;t any Parties of the <HI>Swedes;</HI> but
with Orders to Retreat in Ca&s;e the whole <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI>
Army &s;hould advance.</P>
<P>His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, was at this Time, gone
to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> to &s;ettle the Minds of his People, and
to rai&s;e Money for carrying on the War; as al&s;o,
to appoint more Troops to advance towards the
Frontiers, He likewi&s;e, &s;ettled his Affairs of
Civil Government, and appointed a Body of an
Army to continue about <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> to keep all quiet
at the Capital.</P>
<P>HE had left the Army above, under the Com|mand
of the Princes <HI>Czermet</HI> and <HI>Repuin,</HI> both
bold daring Officers, and accu&s;tom'd to the Ser|vice,
tho' natural <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> and who had often
look'd the <HI>Swedes</HI> in the Face. But, as above, it
<PB N="200" REF="201">
was the <HI>Czar</HI>'s expre&s;s Order to them, to harra&s;s
the <HI>Swedes</HI> with continual Parties, and Excur|sions,
but never to come to a general Battle with
them if it was po&s;&s;ible to avoid it.</P>
<P>THIS they ob&s;erv'd exactly, &s;o that when the
<HI>Swedes</HI> pa&s;s'd the <HI>Vi&s;tula</HI> the&s;e retreated before
them; in the mean Time, the pretended King,
<HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> with a &s;trong Body of Troops, as well
<HI>Poles</HI> as <HI>Swedes</HI> advanc'd toward <HI>Sandomir,</HI> to try
if po&s;&s;ibly he could, either by fair Means, or foul,
bring over the confederate Nobility to joyn
with him; and he had the more Pro&s;pect of it at
that Time, becau&s;e he carry'd with him the In|&s;trument
of King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s relinqui&s;hing them,
and in which, was &s;omthing particularly reflect|ing
upon their Conduct; and which, <HI>if they re&s;ent|ed,</HI>
it might be very propable they would take
Part with the new King. But it was not to be
done, the <HI>Poles</HI> true to them&s;elves, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI>
ever factions, and &s;teady to nothing but their
Un&s;treadine&s;s; tho' they had declin'd the <HI>Czar</HI>'s
Propo&s;al for a new Election, tho' they had no
new King, and their old One had di&s;own'd them,
as a People not worth any Prince's while to Go|vern;
yet they would not hear of <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> but
a&s;&s;embling again at <HI>Opatow,</HI> they bound them|&s;elves
by a new Oath, to oppo&s;e King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI>
and the <HI>Swedes</HI> al&s;o, to the la&s;t Drop. So that
King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> not being willing to u&s;e Force with
them, lea&s;t he &s;hould drive them again into the
Arms of the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> and indeed, not be|ing
&s;trong enough, to attack them, came away and
left them, and jovn'd the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> at <HI>Min&s;k,</HI>
in <HI>Lithuania.</HI> That which encouraged the Con&s;e|derate
Nobility the more, was, that be&s;ides 22000
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> which the <HI>Czar</HI> had ordered to march to
<PB N="201" REF="202">
<HI>Opatow,</HI> to defend them; they had by a particu|lar
Negotiation, brought over the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> of the
<HI>Ukraine,</HI> to favour their Intere&s;t; and General
<HI>Mazeppa,</HI> the famous Chief of the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> ad|vanced
to joyn them with 30000 Hor&s;e, and pro|mi&s;ed
them, on Occa&s;ion, 20000 more.</P>
<P>THIS encourag'd them &s;till the more, and made
the other of the Nobility come in to them; &s;o
that they began to ri&s;e on every Side, again&s;t
<HI>Stani&s;laus;</HI> his Friends had their Hou&s;es in|&s;ulted,
and their Lands Wa&s;ted, and were every
where fain to fly to the <HI>Swedes</HI> for Succour; even
the Palatine of <HI>Kiow,</HI> was obliged to follow the
Cour&s;e of King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> and with all his Depen|dents,
making about 6000 Men, came to the
<HI>Swedes</HI> Camp at <HI>Min&s;k.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Swedes</HI> continu'd in <HI>Lithuania,</HI> from <HI>March</HI>
to the Middle of <HI>June,</HI> not yet re&s;olving, it &s;eems,
which Rout yet to take; And the King of <HI>Swe|den</HI>
not finding <HI>Poland</HI> in a Po&s;ture fit to be
left to their own Defence; In all this Time, they
could never come to any con&s;iderable Action with
the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Troops; The principal Skirmi&s;h we
had with them, was near <HI>Mohilow,</HI> on the <HI>Bori&s;|thenes,</HI>
where they &s;urpriz'd a Body of about
8000 of our Men, mo&s;t of them Dragoons; who,
after a very Gallant Defence, in which the <HI>Swedes</HI>
lo&s;t abundance of Men, were oblig'd to retire
with the Lo&s;s of about 3000 Men kill'd, and
taken Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>THIS Days Action might have let the <HI>Swedes</HI>
have &s;een, that the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Troops were now
quite another &s;ort of People than they u&s;ed to be,
and fought with as much Order and regularity as
other People; that they rallied as expertly after
any Di&s;order; and retreated as orderly after a
<PB N="202" REF="203">
Defeat. In a Word, That they would &s;oon be
equal to other Nations on all Occa&s;ions; but the
<HI>Swedes</HI> were too blind in their own Prai&s;es, to
fore&s;ee the Fate that was before them; &s;o that this
little Victory, did but animate them to their own
Ruin, and prepare them &s;till to do more ra&s;h
Things than ever they had done before.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Swedes,</HI> as if irre&s;olute &s;till what Cour&s;e
to take, &s;tay'd at <HI>Mohilow</HI> 'till the 20th of <HI>July.</HI>
They were now at a Cri&s;is of thier Affairs, if
they had a Mind to march for <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> as they pre+tended;
the Way was before them from <HI>Mohilow</HI>
North Ea&s;t to <HI>Smolen&s;kow,</HI> and &s;o keeping the <HI>Bo|ri&s;thenes</HI>
or <HI>Neiper</HI> on their Left, they had a plain
Country, of about 360 Miles from <HI>Smolen&s;kow</HI>
to <HI>Mo&s;cow;</HI> it is true, the <HI>Czar</HI> had laid wa&s;te
the Frontiers, and lay full in his Way with three
Armies, which altogether made about 140000 Men,
and the&s;e he was re&s;olv'd they &s;hould fight at
three Times, one after another, and all within
two or three Days of one another, before they
could go on.</P>
<P>BUT here it was plain the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> car|ry'd
on a &s;ecret Intelligence with that ruin'd Tray|tor
<HI>Mazeppa,</HI> having found Means by Bribe|ry,
and other Methods, to corrupt him, who had
indeed, the <HI>Ukranian Co&s;&s;aks</HI> much at his Call, be|ing
their hereditary General.</P>
<P>THIS Treaty was carry'd on, as we afterwards
under&s;tood, by &s;ome of King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI>'s his Party,
and particularly by the Palatine of <HI>Kiow,</HI> or,
<HI>Kiovia,</HI> the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s fa&s;t Friend; And
in a &startq;Word, was fully concluded, tho' in an ill
Hour, as well for him&s;elf, as the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
while their Armies lay at <HI>Mohilow.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204">
As &s;oon as the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had a full Satis|faction
that this Treaty was concluded, he de|camp'd
from <HI>Mohilow,</HI> and to the Surprize, not of
the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> only, but of all the World, left the
direct Road for <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> and turn'd away South,
keeping the River on his Right, and march'd Di|rectly
to <HI>Czernikiow</HI> on the River <HI>De&s;na&punc;</HI> on the
Frontiers of the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> Country, and where he
had more immediate Corre&s;pondence with the Re|bel
<HI>Mazeppa,</HI> as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>HAD his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty continued at <HI>Mohilow,</HI>
but 10 Days longer, he had been joyn by his
famous General <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> with 15000 Men, all
gallant Troops indeed, and with a new Train of
heavy Cannon, and a va&s;t Quantity of military
Stores, who was in full March to joyne him. But
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as I have ob&s;erv'd, was un|der
the great <HI>Climacterick</HI> of his Fame, and all
Things went again&s;t him, &s;o he marched away,
and General <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> followed.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erv'd, by tho&s;e who tell this
Story in Favour of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> that Ge|neral
<HI>Lewenhaupt,</HI> having 15000 Men with him,
all old Soldiers, and experienc'd well di&s;$iplin'd
Regiments, he might be very well &s;uppo&s;ed not
to want a Convoy; and the mean Opinion the
<HI>Swedes</HI> had of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> added to their Con|fidence
in that Affair; the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> having
on that Occa&s;ion, &s;aid, as 'tis Reported, that an
Army of 15000 <HI>Swedes</HI> was never beaten by the
<HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> in a pitch'd Battle before, at lea&s;t in
the Memory of Man.</P>
<P>GENERAL <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> had a long March,
for he came from the Provinces of <HI>Courland,</HI> and
<HI>Livania,</HI> where he had drawn this Army together,
with great Care, and been four or five Months in
<PB N="204" REF="205">
his Preparations; he made ea&s;y Marches through
<HI>Lithuania,</HI> where he was joyn'd by &s;ome old Re|giments
of <HI>Swedes</HI> out of the <HI>Great Poland,</HI> and
he was now come within three Leagues of <HI>Mohilow:</HI>
His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty having Notice, of
his March, re&s;olv'd to try the Mettle of his Troops,
upon this Body of Men, and to Cut them off
from joyning the <HI>Swedes</HI> if po&s;&s;ible; and, indeed,
it was a Juncture that required &s;ome <HI>Coup d' Eclat;</HI>
for that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was already po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
of <HI>Czernikiow,</HI> on the <HI>De&s;ua,</HI> where he had been
joyn'd by the Traytor <HI>Mazxeppa,</HI> with 10000 <HI>Co&s;|&s;aks,</HI>
and had the plentiful Country of the
<HI>Ukrain</HI> open to him; &s;o had General Lewenhaupt
Joyn'd him, with the&s;e 15000 Men, his Army
would &s;oon have been 100000 Men; that is to &s;ay,
44000 of his own Army, 15000 of General <HI>Lew|enhaupt,</HI>
all <HI>Swedes,</HI> 8000 of the Palatine of <HI>Kiow,</HI>
who lay ready to joyn him, and 36000 <HI>Co&s;&s;aks</HI>
who <HI>Mazeppa</HI> had promi&s;ed to bring in.</P>
<P>IN this Ca&s;e therefore, I &s;ay, the <HI>Czar</HI> re&s;olv'd
to begin and try his Fortune with General <HI>Lew|enhaupt:</HI>
For this Action he drew out a Select
Body of Men out of all his Army, being about
8000 Hor&s;e, and 23000 Foot, which was the
mo&s;t, and gave the Command of them to that
fortunate General Prince <HI>Menzikoff.</HI> But the
<HI>Czar</HI> knowing the Importance of the Action, went
him&s;elf in Per&s;on to &s;ee it executed, tho' not ta|king
any Command upon him&s;elf, but &s;erv'd un|der
his General as a Voluntier.</P>
<P>THE Fight la&s;ted two Days, and almo&s;t a
Night, the Prince having marched with &s;ome
Speed in the Morning, to come up with the Ene|my,
having &s;hown him&s;elf in Order of Battle,
ab$ut Eleven a-Clock, he gave his Men &s;ome Time
<PB N="205" REF="206">
to Re&s;t, and Refre&s;h them&s;elves; &s;o that he did
not begin the Fight, 'till near Three in the After|noon;
when advancing in excellent Order, he came
again in View of their Line, which was drawn
up to great Advantage, being &s;urrounded with a
Mora&s;s on one Flank; and by their Carriages and
a Rivulet running clo&s;e by them on the other
Flank: Had he entrench'd his Front, which it
was ea&s;y for him to have done, and which he had
Lei&s;ure enough for, it would not have been
practicable for our Men to have attack'd him:
But the <HI>Swedes</HI> &s;corn'd to Entrench again&s;t an
Army of <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> And this arrogant Tem|per
of theirs, was more than this once their
De&s;truction. For now they gave us a fair
Front to fall on, and we failed not to take the
Offer.</P>
<P>&startq;THE On&s;et was given by the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Dra|goons,
Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> commanded Colonel
<HI>Campbell,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Man who had the Van|guard,
to cau&s;e his Regiment of Dragoons to
Di&s;mount and attack two Battalions, which
the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General Count <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> had
cau&s;ed to advance about a Mile before the
Front of his Line, and po&s;ted behind a little
Mora&s;s, to di&s;pute our Pa&s;&s;age: Tho&s;e two
Battallions made &s;o quick a Fire upon our Men,
that they had hardly any time to Form them|&s;elves
into Order of Battle; Colonel <HI>Campbell</HI>
ob&s;erving how active the Enemy were, caus'd
the five Squadrons who had Di&s;mounted to ad|vance,
to give Opportunity to the re&s;t of his
Troops to put them&s;elves into a Po&s;ture to fol|low
them; and tho&s;e Di&s;mounted Dragoons ha|ving
&s;tood the Enemies Fire for &s;ome time, his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty cau&s;ed them to be &s;upported by
<PB N="206" REF="207">
four Battalions of his Guards, and two of <HI>Inger|manland:</HI>
Our Men pouring in their Shot, up|on
the two fore-mention'd Battalions, killed
above half of them that guarded the Pa&s;&s;age,
and &s;o facilitated our drawing up in Battalia
before the Enemies front.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;GENERAL <HI>Lewenhaupt,</HI> perceiving his Van|guard
was Beaten, re&s;olved to prevent us; and
cau&s;ed his Army to march up and meet us in
Battalia, then his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty ob&s;erving
that the Enemies Line extended wider than
ours, ordered his Highne&s;s Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI>
to cau&s;e four Regiments of Dragoons to alight,
and they were immediately placed in our Left
Wing, with two Regiments of Hor&s;e to cover
their Flank, under the Command of General
<HI>Pflug;</HI> and our Right was commanded by the
Princes of <HI>Gallcizin</HI> and <HI>Darm&s;tadt,</HI> who&s;e Flank
was cover'd by two Regiments of Dragoons of
his Highne&s;s Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI>'s Guards; all
the&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions being made, about Eleven a
Clock the Signal for attacking the Enemy was
given by a general Di&s;charge of all our Artillery:
About 12 a Clock the Enemy began to advance
towards us with great Fiercene&s;s and Re&s;olution;
and the Fight being hot and ob&s;tinate on both
Sides, for above an Hour and half, the Vict|ory
hung in Su&s;pence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;DURING the terrible Fire, which was made
every where, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty appear'd in the
Places of mo&s;t Danger, to annimate by his Va|lour,
and Pre&s;ence, all the Officers and Soldiers;
and ob&s;erving that the Left &s;uffer'd much, he
cau&s;ed it to be reinforced by the Regiment of
Guards of Prince <HI>Menzikoff.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">
&startq;THE Enemy ob&s;erving, how well we acquit|ted
our &s;elves under the Eye of our Augu&s;t Ma|&s;ter,
begun to give Ground, yet drew off in
Order of Battle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THEN we redoubl'd our Efforts, to improve
that Advantage: The Enemy being driven
back to their Waggons and Baggage, the Action
was for &s;ome time forborn on both Sides; about
three a Clock our Cannon coming up, began to
play again.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THINGS &s;tanding thus, His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
being inform'd, that General <HI>Bour</HI> was within
half a League of him with 4000 Men, thought
fit to wait a little for his Arrival.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;ABOUT four a Clock General <HI>Bour</HI> came up
with his Body, and was oblig'd to endure the
Fire of the Enemies Artillery, before he
could joyn our Right, where he was to po&s;t
him&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;FROM this Junction, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty be|gan
to entertain Hopes that all would end well;
and order'd that neither Right nor Left, &s;hould
renew the Fight one without the other; but
the Left Wing, having &s;tood a good while
without attacking, the Impatience of all our
Officers and Soldiers &s;uperceeded that Order,
our Right Wing renew'd the Attack likewi&s;e
with the utmo&s;t Vigour.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THE Enemy &s;eeing them&s;elves repuls'd,
caus'd two Battallions and ten Squadrons of
their Re&s;erve to advance, and Charge our Right
in Flank; but they were &s;o well received, and
afterwards &s;o clo&s;ly pur&s;u'd, that, of the two
Battallions, not above 50 Men e&s;caped. Upon
this Advantage, our left, and our Center, pu&s;h'd
forward among the Enemies Waggons, break|ing
<PB N="202" REF="209">
all their Left Wing. On their Right <HI>Lew|enhaupt</HI>
rallying his Troops, faced our Men who
were among their Waggons, and cau&s;ed &s;uch a
Fire to be made on our Battallions and Squa|drons,
as oblig'd them to retire; but our Cen|ter,
and Left Wing advanced at the &s;ame Time
again&s;t the Enemy, who were oblig'd to Face
to the Right about, to make Head again&s;t us; then
the Charge, was renewed with greater Fury than
before, both by the Hor&s;e and Foot, and their
Fire which the Enemy an&s;wer'd duly, did not
cea&s;e 'till it was dark Night, when we could no
longer di&s;tinugi&s;h our own Men, from our
Enemis.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;IN the Night, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty con&s;ider|ing
the Difficulty of di&s;lodging the Enemy
from behind the Waggons, forbid the Officers,
on pain of being Ca&s;hier'd, and the Soldiers of
being hang'd, to quit their Ranks, to rifle the
killed; &s;o the Army kept all Night under Arms
watching the Enemy, In the mean Time the
Trophies of the Day, were pre&s;ented to his
Maje&s;ty, con&s;i&s;ting of 47 Colours, and 10
Standards; and 16 Cannon, which he had
gain'd, were added to our Train of Artillery.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THUS we pa&s;s'd the Night, which was very
Cold, and towards the Morning, we &s;aw the
Enemy kindle Fires, about their Waggons. His
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty order'd that Fires al&s;o &s;hould be
made in the Front of our Line, and that
we &s;hould hold our &s;elves in a Readine&s;s again&s;t
Break of Day; which being come, we march'd
towards the Enemies Waggons, expecting to meet no le&s;s Re&s;i&s;tance than before; but we
found that <HI>Lewenhaupt,</HI> had made u&s;e of that
Stratagem to cover his Flight, abandoning to
<PB N="203" REF="210">
our Di&s;cretion, all the Wounded, and 7000
Waggons de&s;ign'd to Supply the Want under
which the King his Ma&s;ter Labours.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;GENERAL <HI>Pflug</HI> was immediately order'd
with a 1000 Granadiers on Hor&s;e-back, and
2000 Dragoons, to pur&s;ue and harra&s;s the fly|ing
Enemy; he had not March'd above half
a League, when he found the Remains of the
Enemy in a Wood, and falling upon them,
he made a Slaughter among them for the
Space of a League and a half, to <HI>Propoi|&s;ick'</HI>
where the re&s;t of the Run-aways, to the
Number of 3000, retir'd into the Church-Yard.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;OUR General advancing to Force them,
they made a Signal that they were de&s;irous
to Capitulate; and then he &s;ent a Lieutenant
Colonel, with &s;ix Granadiers, to receive their
Offers of Capitulation; but many of the <HI>Swe|di&s;h</HI>
Soldiers being Drunk with Brandy, would
not agree to their Officers Propo&s;itions, and
many of them Firing, kill'd two of our Gra|nadiers,
the Lieutenant Colonel &s;eeing their
Headine&s;s, retir'd. And General <HI>Pflug</HI> re&s;olv'd
not to &s;pare them; our Granadiers and Dra|goons
enter'd the Church Yard Sword in
Hand, kill'd all that re&s;i&s;ted. During this Exe|cution,

they had lo&s;t all their Ammunition, and all
their Magazine, among which were 20000 &s;mall
Arms, wherewith they propos'd to Arm, and
Di&s;cipline the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> which &s;hould Rebel; they
lo&s;t 500 Ton of Musket Bullets, 6000 Barrels of
Powder, and about 600000 Rixdolars in Money;
their Communication with <HI>Poland</HI> was entirely
cut off, and the Palatine of <HI>Kiow,</HI> the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI>'s faithful Allie, was utterly di&s;abled
by another Defeat given him, by the Crown
Army of <HI>Poland;</HI> &s;o that King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI>
and General <HI>Cra&s;&s;au,</HI> who with another Army of
18000 were advanc'd almo&s;t to <HI>Lemberg,</HI> could
get no intelligence of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or
<PB N="205" REF="214">
of his Army, nor by any Means break thorough
to &s;et him Free.</P>
<P>IT is true, the Province of <HI>Ukrania,</HI> a rich,
fertil, and plentiful Country, &s;upply'd the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> effectually with Provi&s;ions in Great
Plenty; and his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;eeing what
Condition he was reduced to, mark'd out a Camp,
in a very advantagious Situation, on the River
<HI>De&s;na</HI> between <HI>Czeruikhow</HI> and <HI>Meko&s;zi;</HI> where he
caus'd &s;trong Entrenchments to be made, and
mounted his Cannon re&s;olving not to be attack'd
by Surprize. Here he re&s;olv'd to &s;tay till he had
recruited his Magazines of Millitary Provi&s;ions
as well as his Army with Troops; but during his
whole Stay here, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;o &s;cour'd
the Country with continual Parties, that no Me&s;|&s;enger
he could ever &s;end arriv'd, nor could he
receive any Intelligence from the re&s;t of <HI>Poland,</HI>
or they from him.</P>
<P>DURING this long Encampment, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty's General, by ince&s;&s;ant Parties, cut off
abundance of his Men, and continually harra&s;s'd
them with his Troops, and gave them two or three
very con&s;iderable Defeats.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, the <HI>Swedes</HI> on the other
Hand, found Means to get &s;ome Supplies of Amu|nition
out of <HI>Podolia,</HI> and from <HI>Lemberg</HI> they got
&s;ome &s;mall Arms, tho' all was with great Difficulty
brought to them, the Confederates being &s;tronge&s;t
on that Side, and it being a mo&s;t tedious Way to
bring things all by Land Carriage to <HI>Kiovia</HI> in
the <HI>Ukrainal&s;o;</HI> and on the Side of <HI>Vol$inia,</HI> they
Li&s;ted a great many Men, with which they fill'd
up all the Regiments of General <HI>Leuwenbaupt</HI>'s
Army, which we had defeated, and made them
as &s;trong as when we fir&s;t attack'd him; on|ly,
<PB N="206" REF="215">
with this Exception, namely, that they were
not &s;o good Soldiers by a great Deal.</P>
<P>THUS the two Armies pa&s;s'd the Winter, and
the fir&s;t part of the Spring. But the Sea&s;on ad|vancing,
and the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;till fancying
him&s;elf &s;trong enough to put his De&s;igns in Ex|ecution,
and hoping for great Matters from the
<HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> he prepar'd for his Enterprize.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould have been ob&s;ery'd here, that the
Rebel <HI>Mazeppa,</HI> finding the <HI>Czar</HI> Pre&s;s'd hard up|on
the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> and terrify'd them from follow|ing

a$van$'d to <HI>B$ury$ Mazeppa</HI>'s chief Town and

three Battcries in two Days Time, with the Help

<PB N="207" REF="216">
the Place, that in one Night and Day, he had
made a tolerable Breach, which tho' it was not
what they call practicable, in the Common Dia|lect
of the Enginiers, yet he caus'd it to be
&s;torm'd: The Garri&s;on defended them&s;elves with
a great deal of Ob&s;tinacy, and kill'd the <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI>
by Heaps in their Ditches. But the Ru&s;&s;i|ans
led on again, and annimated by the Pre&s;ence
of their Generals, fell on with &s;uch Fury, and
withal, in &s;uch Numbers, that they enter'd the
Town Sword in Hand, cut all the Traytor <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI>
being 6000, as above, in Pieces; not giving Quar|ter
to one of them; which was a Piece of requi&s;ite
Ju&s;tice, not only upon them for their Trea&s;on
and Rebellion, but in Terror to the re&s;t, who
had &s;hew'd Inclination enough to Rebel; as for
the Town it was plunder'd by the Soldiers.</P>
<P>NOR did their Execution fail of its di&s;ign'd End,
for it effectually aw'd the re&s;t of the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> from revolting to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as was the de&s;ign
of the whole Nation of them, be&s;ides which, it
le&s;&s;en'd the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> Army 6000 Men, for
tho&s;e 6000 were Part of the 10000 who had join'd
the <HI>Swedes</HI> with their General.</P>
<P>AFTER the taking of this Town, which was
Sight of the whole <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army, the River
<HI>De&s;ua</HI> only parting them; over which, however,
the <HI>Swedes</HI> had no Bridge. I &s;ay, after this, the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> General &s;uppre&s;&s;'d entirely the Di&s;&s;afecti|on
of the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> and having proclaim'd <HI>Mazep|pa</HI>
a Traytor, and cau&s;ed him to be bang'd in
Effigic, made the whole Body of <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> meet,
and choo&s;e another Chief or General, which was
done with the loud Acclamations of the People;
&s;o the <HI>Czar</HI> was in &s;ome Degree even with the
King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> for if he depo&s;ed one King, the
<PB N="208" REF="217">
<HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> now depo&s;ed another, for tho
<HI>Mazeppa</HI> was not a King in Title, he was equal
to a King in Power, and every way Equal if not
Superior to King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> in the divided Circum|&s;tances,
in which his Power &s;tood, even at the
be&s;t of it.</P>
<P>AND now the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> having re&s;olv'd
to move forward, decamp'd, in an evil Hour for
him, in the begining of <HI>June,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>De&s;|na</HI>
at <HI>Czeruibow</HI> advanced towards <HI>Pultowa.</HI> The
Country all the Way in this March being low and
level, is full of Rivers-which fall into the <HI>Neiper,</HI>
and lying ju&s;t cro&s;s the Way which the <HI>Swedes</HI> were
to March, they had &s;ometimes three or four of
tho&s;e Rivers to pa&s;s in a Day; the Rea&s;on of this
is plain, for that the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Bori&s;thenes</HI>
being here from <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South,</HI> and the great
River receiving into it all the &s;maller Rivers of
the Country of both Sides, the Cour&s;e of tho&s;e
Rivers naturally mu&s;t be from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t,</HI> on
the Side where the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army march'd.</P>
<P>THIS retarded the March of the <HI>Swedes</HI> very
much, who were oblig'd to mate Bridges over
mo&s;t of tho&s;e Rivers, and who drew a great
Train of Carriages with them for their Baggage,
and Ammunition, be&s;ides their Artillery.</P>
<P>SOME of the&s;e Rivers indeed, the Weather
being dry, and the Sea&s;on &s;o far advanc'd, were
low, and might be foarded by the Cavalry and
Carriages, but others again could not.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> who&s;e Autho|rity
pre&s;s'd on his Men, forc'd to March over all
the Rivers, and whatever Difficulties offer'd to
&s;tand in his Way, pu&s;h'd on till he came to <HI>Pul|towa;</HI>
a Town which the <HI>Czar</HI> had forti$y'd in a
better manner than formerly; and as it was a
<PB N="209" REF="218">
Frontier again&s;t the <HI>Budriack Tarter,</HI> who u&s;ed to
make their Incur&s;ions that way into <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty finding the <HI>Swedes</HI> in
Motion, broke up with all his Army from <HI>Smo|len&s;ko,</HI>
where he had encamped in order to di&s;pute
the Ground Inch by Inch with them, if they had
offer'd to move towards <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> and mov'd after
them; he had never &s;tirr'd from that Situation
with the Gro&s;s of his Army while the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> lay on the Bank of the <HI>De&s;na,</HI> lea&s;t find|ing
his Army remov'd, they &s;hould counter
March and &s;lip by him on the Way to <HI>Mo&s;cow;</HI>
but now finding the <HI>Swedes,</HI> running farther
into the Net, he pur&s;u'd with his whole Army,
which was about 70000 Men, be&s;ides about 42000
which were po&s;ted at di&s;tant Places, as at <HI>Mohi|low,</HI>
and at the River <HI>Bug,</HI> to prevent Succours
pa&s;&s;ing to the <HI>Swedes.</HI></P>
<P>WITH this Army his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty follow'd
the <HI>Swedes</HI> &s;o clo&s;e, that he was always at Hand
to take any Advantage that might offer.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who was now near the
End of his good Fortune, and found him&s;elf
embarra&s;s'd with the Difficulties of the Country,
encamp'd under the Walls of a Town, tho' not
considerable in it &s;elf, yet better fortified, and
better furni&s;h'd than he expected, wanting many
Things nece&s;&s;ary for a Seige of Importance; and
which was wor&s;e, the <HI>Czar,</HI> who he had always
flatter'd him&s;elf, would never venture a Battle, was,
as I have &s;aid at his Back with an Army of 70000
Men, and not only &s;eem'd re&s;olv'd to venture a
Battle with him, but po&s;ted him&s;elf in &s;uch a man|ner,
as that it was apparent he would Be&s;iege him
and his Camp, and perhaps attack his Intrench|ments.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="219">
HAD not the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Courage exceed|ed
his Di&s;cretion at that Time, and his ill Fate
hurry'd him on to his own De&s;truction, he would
certainly have carry'd on his Attacks in the u&s;ual
Form, and choo&s;ing a &s;trong Situation, have en|camped
with the Gro&s;s of his Army to cover the
Siege; expecting that if the <HI>Czar</HI> would rai&s;e the
Seige, he &s;hould fight him with all the Di&s;advan|tages
u&s;ual on &s;uch Occa&s;ions; as namely, that of
attacking a Powerful Army entrenche'd up to the
Teeth, and po&s;ted with all po&s;&s;ible Art and Ad|vantage.</P>
<P>BUT on the other Hand, had their Re&s;olution
to Fight been attended with the u&s;ual Prudence of
a good General, &s;uch as the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> cer|tainly
was, and &s;uch, as if he had not been &s;o
him&s;elf, all his other leading Men were e&s;teem'd
to be; particularly, Field Mari&s;chal <HI>Rhen&s;child,</HI>
the Generals <HI>Lewenhaupt, Slippenback, Stakelberg,
Stenbook</HI> and others; and it was very &s;trange they
&s;hould not re$rain him, by Rea&s;oning again&s;t the
Mea&s;ures taken; but to do him Ju&s;tice, it is re|ported
that his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was not &s;o much
for fighting as his Generals were, and that it was
$word$ in a Council of War, before the King gave
his Opinion: The ca&s;e was dubious, and every
Man $word$ to &s;peak fir&s;t again&s;t Fighting, lea&s;t
be &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to want Courage, and lea&s;t
the King, who&s;e Temper was 7s;o well known,
&s;hould re&s;ert it; thus it was that all Men voted
for $span$ even almo&s;t every one of them
were again&s;t it in their Judgements.</P>
<P>THIS was too much the Effect of the exceed|ing
Fire in the Temper of their Monarch, who was
&s;o much $word$ by his Officers, that they it
$word$ voted as they thought would be mo&s;t agree|able
<PB N="211" REF="220">
to their Prince's Humour, than Safe and pru|dent
for his Intere&s;t and Honour.</P>
<P>THE Neighbourhood and Strength of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
Army made it difficult, and &s;carce practicable
to carry on the Siege of the Place, the Garri&s;on
being numerous al&s;o, and well furni&s;h'd, and the
<HI>Swedes</HI> began to &s;ee a Nece&s;&s;ity of removing the
Enemy, or of rai&s;ing the Siege, and upon this
Occa&s;ion, the great Council of War was called,
where it was, unfortunately for them, re&s;olv'd
to Fight.</P>
<P>BEING now come to mention the Battle it &s;elf,
I refer the Reader to a full Account of it given
by the Enemy them&s;elves, becau&s;e what they ac|knowledge
comes with ah Authority not to be
deny'd; whereas, &s;peaking of a Thing of &s;uch
Con&s;equence on the Side of that Monarch, who&s;e
Story we write, we may be the more &s;u&s;pected
of Flattery and partiality; take it then from
their own Accounts as follows,</P>
<P>&startq;Our Army, <HI>&s;ay</HI> they, con&s;i&s;ted of about 36000
Men if we had been all together, of whom our
Cavalry made the better Half; our Infantry in
the Battle, were not above 15000; neither had
we any Artillery with us; the De&s;ign being to
force an Enterance, and then break in with our
Hor&s;e; of the&s;e Forces we left our whole Body
of Re&s;erve as before noted, in the Camp; which,
with other Troops left there, were about 8000
Men; &s;o that in the Battle we had not above
28000 Men.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THE King led on his Cavalry, and with him
General <HI>Lewenhaupt, Steenboch,</HI> and <HI>Spar; Rhen&s;|child,
Horn and Stakelberg</HI> commanded the Foot;
as &s;oon as we came out of the Defiles, and &s;aw
the Countenance of the Enemy, it was ea&s;ie to
<PB N="212" REF="221">
&s;ee we had a terrible Task on our Hands; but
there was no looking back, the King with his
u&s;ual intrepidity advanc'd to the Charge, and
with his Hor&s;e fell upon a great Body of <HI>Mu&s;co|vite</HI>
Hor&s;e, who were advanc'd from The re&s;t,
and in a Moment drove them into the Line of
Hor&s;e, which &s;tood behind them, upon which
the re&s;t of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e advancing the
whole Line acted at once, and pu&s;h'd the Ene|my
&s;everal times into Confu&s;ion; but by the
Vigilance of their Officers, and the help of new
Troops, they re&s;tored their Line and fought with
the utmo&s;t ob&s;tinacy: During this part of the
Action, the Enemy with a great Body of Hor&s;e,
and &s;ome Foot had wheel'd at &s;ome di&s;tance,
and appear'd on our Flank in order to &s;ur|round
our Cavalry, &s;ome Troops charg'd them,
but being over power'd were repul&s;ed, and
this made us &s;lacken the Charge in Front for
fear of being cut of from our Infantry.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;THAT in the mean time our Infantry ad|vancing,
and the Hor&s;e making a Halt till they
came up, form'd them&s;elves in order of Battle,
the Hor&s;e on the Wings, and the Foot in Cen|ter,
and advanc'd again directly to the Enemy,
Charging them with great Fury and good Suc|ce&s;s;
but the Cannon from the entrench'd
Camp advancing, and the Troops opening in
&s;everal Places for their playing upon us; it
was impo&s;&s;ible our Foot could keep their or|der,
or the Men &s;tand in the Face of &s;eventy
Peices of Cannon, loaden with Cartouches of
&s;mall Shot; &s;o that our Generals &s;aw it ab&s;olute|ly
nece&s;&s;ary to draw of the Foot, the Hor&s;e all
this while continu'd engaged, and drove the
Cavalry of the Enemy every where before them,
<PB N="213" REF="222">
but the Enemies Foot advancing to &s;upport
their Cavalry with their Fire, our Hor&s;e al&s;o
&s;ounded a Retreat, and drew off in very good
order out of the Field of Battle, recover|ing
the Defiles were our Foot was po&s;ted. The
Enemy made a no pur&s;uit at that time, the E|nemy
made &s;hew of advancing indeed on our
Left, and &s;ome Skirmi&s;hes happen'd, but they
were beaten off with Lo&s;s; however, having
thus left the Field of Battle to the Enemy, &s;e|veral
Di&s;a&s;ters follow'd; as fir&s;t, being cut of
from our Camp, our Body of Re&s;erve, our Ar|tillery,
heavy Baggage, Carriages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fell all
into the Enemies Hands, and the Troops left
there were oblig'd to yeild them&s;elves Pri&s;o|ners
of War; in this Condition there was nothing
left to con&s;ider of, but Retreating with all po&s;|&s;ible
Speed before the Enemy &s;hould be in a
po&s;ture to attack us, and the way for this was,
if po&s;&s;ible to reach the <HI>Bari&s;thenes,</HI> and get
means to pa&s;s over the Troops, and reach to
<HI>Kiou.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;GENERAL <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> had the Conduct of the
Retreat, and he march'd with &s;uch Expedition,
that all the Troops came to the Bank of the
River the next Day, about One at Night, tho'
extreamly fatigu'd and harra&s;s'd, e&s;pecially
the poor Infantry, of whom many died by the
way, either of their Wounds, or by the extremity
of the March; in&s;omuch, that as appear'd after|wards,
there were not 4000 of them left, above
3000 of them cho&s;e rather to fall into the Enemies
Hands, then &s;uffer &s;o &s;evere a March, and &s;o drop'd
off &s;ome and &s;ome by the way, expecting every
Hour to be knock'd on the Head by the Ene|my,
many of them wandered about the Coun|try,
<PB N="214" REF="223">
and got into <HI>Poland</HI> afterwards, and Li&s;ted
in the Troops of King <HI>Stani&s;lans,</HI> &s;o e&s;caping to
the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army at better Lei&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;BUT we were in no better Condition now then
before, for the River was a full &s;top to us; Boats
there was none, we had no Materials for a
Bridge, or time to ma ke it, we knew the Ene|my
was at our Heels; we had neither Strength
left to Defend our&s;elves, nor Ammunition to
Supply a Battle if we were di&s;po&s;ed to it; nei|ther
had we Provi&s;ions to keep our Men from
peri&s;hing: In this &s;trait the main Concern of
our Generals was for the &s;afety of the King, to
have him fall into the Hands of the Enemy
was wor&s;e than Death to think of, there was
but one way, which was to venture to Swim the
great and rapid River that we lay on the Bank
of, and then to make the be&s;t of his way into the
<HI>Turks</HI> Dominions, his Maje&s;ty made light of the
hazard; but it was ea&s;ie to &s;ee that it was with
extream reluctance that he parted with his be|loved
Troops, who he knew mu&s;t immediately
fall into the Hands of the Enemy; but there
was no deliberating in the Choice; his Maje&s;ty
could not by &s;taying &s;ave his Men, and falling
into the Enemies Hands with them, would but
increa&s;e their Misfortune, &s;o it was re&s;olv'd;
and the next morning the King, attended by
about $word$ of the be&s;t Hor&s;e pa&s;s'd the River in a
little Boat, mo&s;t of the re&s;t Swam the River, be|ing
$word$ by &s;ome <HI>Co&s;&s;ack</HI> Gentlemen, who it
&s;eems in that Country make light of it;
they all $word$ &s;afe on the other Side. His Ma|j$&s;ty

&s;hould f$llow towards the <HI>Turks</HI> Dominions,

where they would &s;oon hear of him, if he got
&s;afe thither. That &s;ame Evening the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
Prince <HI>Menzickoff</HI> at the Head of about 10000
Hor&s;e, appear'd in &s;ight of our Camp, and Ge|neral
<HI>Rein&s;child,</HI> who was then Pri&s;oner among
them, having &s;ignify'd to them, as they &s;aid,
that it was probable in the Condition we was
in, we would Capitulate; the Prince &s;ent a Trum|pet
with a <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Captain, and a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Co|lonel
with a Letter to our General, to offer us,
if we would Surrender, good U&s;age and hono|rable
Conditions; this was the more welcome
to us, becau&s;e it was wholly unexpected: The
matter needed no Debate, our Circum|&s;tances
admitted of nothing el&s;e, and if
he had not &s;ent to us; we mu&s;t have &s;ent to

after holding a &s;hort Council of War,
return'd a re&s;pectful An&s;wer to the Prince,
&s;ignifying, that if he might have Soldier like
u&s;age, and be treated honourably, he would en|ter

<P>OUR Lo&s;s being thus of our whole Army, it is

the Battle, cannot be true; we reckon about 6000
kill'd in the Action, 2000 Pri&s;oners, at that time
al&s;o, 7000 in the Camp before <HI>Pultowa,</HI> about
2000 who &s;wam over the River, with, and after

<P>I COME then to the Account, which was given
from the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Army, which is more proper|ly
my Part, and which varies in nothing, but the
Manner of Things: Which, however, is very
&s;ignificant to know, and is as follows.</P>
<P>&startq;AFTER the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> had pa&s;s'd the River
<HI>Work&s;$a</HI> with their whole Army on the 20th of
<HI>June, O. S.</HI> they encamp'd within a League of
the <HI>Swedes</HI> till the 24th, that Day they advanc'd
within a Quarter of a League of them, and en|camping,
pre&s;ently caus'd an Entrenchment
to be thrown up before the Camp to prevent
all Surprize; their Cavalr$ was po&s;ted in the
Woods, cover'd by the Re$oubts, furni&s;h'd with
Men; and tho' the <HI>Czar</HI> gave out Orders for
preparing to attack the Enemy, they prevent|ed
him according to their u&s;ual Cu&s;tom; for on
the 27th early in the Morning, while it was
yet dark, the <HI>Swedes</HI> came nut of the Defiles,
where they had lain all Night on their Arms,
and attack'd the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Cavalry both
<PB N="221" REF="230">
with their Hor&s;e and Foot &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that
notwith&s;tanding they were repul&s;ed &s;everal
times, and beaten off with Lo&s;s from the Redoubts
which they a&s;&s;aulted, the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Cavalry,
who cou'd not be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in time by the Infan|try,
were oblig'd to retire towards their En|trenchments;
but &s;oon return'd to the Charge,
entirely defeating the <HI>Swedes</HI> Right Wing, and
took Pri&s;oner General <HI>Slippenback,</HI> who com|manded
it; while this was doing the <HI>Czar</HI> de|tach'd
Prince <HI>Menzickoff,</HI> General in chief of
the Army, and Lieutenant General <HI>Rentzell,</HI> as
well to cut of the Troops, who were advancing
to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Enemy, as to attack
tho&s;e left in the Trenches under the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Ge|neral
<HI>Ro&s;en;</HI> the Prince marching accordingly,
met in his way the Enemy's Body of Re&s;erve
of 3000 Men, who&s;e Right Wing was Flank'd
by a Wood; after &s;ome Re&s;&s;i&s;tance he broke
them, put &s;ome to the Sword, gave Quarters to
the re&s;t, and return'd to the main Army; leaving
Lieutenant General <HI>Rentzell</HI> to proceed on
to <HI>Pultowa,</HI> at who&s;e approach the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Ge|neral
<HI>Ro&s;en</HI> retir'd with his Regiments into the
Works they had made; however, the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
General attack'd him, and forc'd him after &s;ome
Re&s;&s;i&s;tance to Surrender with all his Men at
Di&s;cretion: On the other hand, the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army
having in retiring joyned their Foot; all
the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army drew up in order of Battle a|gain&s;t
the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Front, at the di&s;tance of a|bout
a Quarter of a League; the <HI>Czar</HI> at the
&s;ame time caus'd two Lines to move out of the
Entrenchments, leaving the Third to guard the
Camp, and drew up his Army in &s;uch a manner,
that his Infantry made the main Body, and
<PB N="222" REF="231">
the Cavalry the two Wings, of which the
Right was commanded by Lieutenant <HI>Bauer</HI>
in the room of Lieutenant General <HI>Rence,</HI> who
was wounded in the fir&s;t Engagement: The
Left was commanded by Prince <HI>Menzickoff,</HI> his
Pre&s;ence being mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, and his main
Body was commanded by the <HI>Czar</HI> in Per&s;on:
The Field Mar&s;hal <HI>Czeremettoff;</HI> the Generals
of the Foot, Prince <HI>Rep$in</HI> and M. <HI>Hallard,</HI>
as al&s;o Lieutenant General <HI>Belling</HI> attend|ing
at his Po&s;t; Lieutenant General <HI>Brous</HI> had
the Direction of the Artillery; the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
Army being in this po&s;ture, no &s;ooner began
to move towards the <HI>Swedes,</HI> then contrary to
expectation, the&s;e had the boldne&s;s after the re|pul&s;e
they had receiv'd, to advance to meet
them: About nine in the Morning the Fight
began, and the fire grew thick on both Sides,
which the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> continu'd with &s;uch Brave|ry
that they defeated and broke the <HI>Swedes</HI> Army,
after a Battle of half an Hour; a thing very
&s;trange, and put both their Hor&s;e and Foot to
the Rout, the latter not daring to Halt, or
make farther oppo&s;ition, and were driven like
a Herd of Cattle, with Sword, Bayonet and
Pike quite to the Woods. Major-General <HI>Sta|kelberg</HI>
was the fir&s;t Pri&s;oner taken, then Gene|ral
<HI>Hamilton,</HI> Field Mar&s;hal <HI>Rhen&s;child,</HI> the
Prince of <HI>Wirtenberg,</HI> Cou&s;in to the King of
<HI>Sweden;</HI> many Colonels and Subaltern Officers,
and &s;ome thou&s;ands of Foot and Hor&s;e, a great
Number of which yielded them&s;elves volunta|rily
with their Hor&s;es, and Arms. The <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI>
Cavalry pur&s;ued the <HI>Swedes</HI> full &s;peed a|bove
half a League, that the Plains and Woods
for three Leagues round the <HI>Pultowa,</HI> were &s;trew|ed
<PB N="223" REF="232">
with the Enemies Bodies; the Number of
their kill'd being 8 or 10000; thus by the help of
the Almighty they gain'd &s;o compleat a Victo|ry
over the <HI>Swedes,</HI> that it is hardly to be paral|lel'd,
and that with little Lo&s;s by the Victori|ous
Arms of the <HI>Czar,</HI> and under his own Con|duct,
in which he mo&s;t eminently fignaliz'd
his Valour and Experience in the War, expo&s;ing
him&s;elf to all Dangers, and had his Hat &s;hot
thro'; Prince <HI>Menzickoff</HI> had three Hor&s;es
wounded under him; 'tis worthy to be remark|ed,
that 'twas only a Line of Foot, of 10000
Men, who defeated the Enemy, the other Line
not being engaged. Here follows a Li&s;t of the
Pri&s;oners, and of what was taken from the

the 28th in pur&s;uit of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> could not
overtake them till the 30th, notwith&s;tanding

precipitately, leaving behind them the greate&s;t

than that he e&s;caped, as hath been &s;aid, into the
Dominions of the Grand Seignior, and was well
receiv'd by the Order of the Port at the City of
<HI>Bender,</HI> a Frontier of the <HI>Turks,</HI> on the Side of
<HI>Tartary,</HI> and on the Banks of the <HI>Nei&s;ter,</HI> and
where he meditated his Revenge, in a Manner &s;o
unbecoming a Chri&s;tian Prince, as to animate
the <HI>Manometans</HI> and Common Enemies of <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans,</HI>
to make a War again&s;t the <HI>Czar;</HI> and was
again the Occa&s;ion of much Blood, and much
Co&s;t to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> World, as &s;hall appear in its
Place.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had now no more Work
upon his Hands of this Kind, the Grand Enemy
being thus gone, and that Army entirely defeat|ed,
which had been &s;o long the Terror of <HI>Poland;</HI>
what remain'd, was the Work of meer Negotiation
and Alliance. The pretended King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI>
and his Party, having now lo&s;t their main Sup|porter,
fell into their fir&s;t Nothing, whence they
came, and King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> dethron'd in an Arbitra|ry
and violent Manner, as has been &s;aid; was in|vited
to re-a&s;&s;ume the Kingdom, even by many of
tho&s;e, who had been In&s;truments in turning him out.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="237">
THAT Part of the Affairs of <HI>Poland,</HI> relate &s;o
much to the Affairs of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and the <HI>Czar</HI> had
&s;o much Glory in re&s;toring that ruin'd Prince
King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> notwith&s;tanding he had relinqui&s;h'd
his Friend&s;hip, and broken his Treaties with him,
that it cannot be omitted.</P>
<P>AS Moderation, and doing Good for Evil, is
one of the Be&s;t of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Virtues, &s;o forgetting
Injuries, and relieving oppre&s;s'd Princes, is one
of the brighte&s;t Parts in the Glory of the Conque|ror;
the <HI>Czar</HI> made it one of his fir&s;t Di&s;patches,
to give King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> a Part in the Joy of his
Victory, and thereby let his <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;ee,
that he had Kindne&s;s enough left, to forget what
was pa&s;t, and place it all to the Account of the
Violence he was under; and we were told a Me&s;|&s;age
was &s;oon after &s;ent to invite him to rea&s;|&s;ume
the Throne, with A&s;&s;urances of Support,
from the &s;ame conquering Hand, which had driven
his only Enemy, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> his only formi|dable
Enemy out of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and who was
now in a State of Exile, among the <HI>Barbarians,</HI>
without an Army, without his victorious Gene|rals,
without his Chief Mini&s;ter Count <HI>Piper,</HI>
without Friends, and without Money; and con|&s;equently,
that there was no Room to fear his
Return into <HI>Poland,</HI> or meddling any more with
the Affairs of that Country.</P>
<P>WHETHER this were &s;o or not, <HI>this is certain,</HI>
that King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> no &s;ooner received this &s;urprizing
and unexpected News, but he began to ca&s;t
about his Return and meditate his going back in|to
<HI>Poland,</HI> to recover the Crown, which was torn
from his Head by Violence and War: Nor was it
long before he receiv'd &s;uch Invitations from the
<HI>Poles</HI> them&s;elves, as without any Room to con&s;ider
<PB N="229" REF="238">
farther, determin'd him in the Affirmative, as
we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>IF the Overthrow of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was
a Surprize of Joy to the abdicated King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI>
it was no le&s;s an A&s;toni&s;hment to King <HI>Stani&s;laus;</HI>
indeed it was a Clap of Thunder to him, a Bla$t
from Heaven, that at one Gu&s;t, overthrew him
and all his Intere&s;t and Friends.</P>
<P>HE was at <HI>Lemberg</HI> when he met with the
News, and had with him General <HI>Cra&s;&s;au,</HI> with a
Body of 16000 <HI>Swedes,</HI> very good Troops, and
had about 12000 <HI>Poles,</HI> who were mo&s;t of them
Gentlemen, and were very well mounted: So
that he had near 30000 Men, be&s;ides the Palatine
of <HI>Kiou,</HI> who was hearty in his Intere&s;t, and had
about 8000 Men more, with him, at his capital
City of <HI>Kiou,</HI> or <HI>Kiovia.</HI></P>
<P>HAD the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> after the Lo&s;s of
the Battle at <HI>Pultowa,</HI> in&s;tead of Flying into the
<HI>Turks</HI> Dominions he &s;carce knew whether, kept
to the North, and gone to <HI>Kiou,</HI> and had directed
all that could e&s;cape to have done the like, he
had play'd a Game, that might &s;till have renew'd
the War, for his Cavalry which &s;urrender'd to
the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> would immediately have &s;eparated,
and in &s;mall Bodies have e&s;cap'd, and perhaps
five or &s;ix Thou&s;and of them, have got together
there; and having &s;uch a Body of Men at Hand,
as King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> and the Palatine <HI>Kiou</HI> had, as
above, he would have been 50000 &s;trong again
immediately; but, <HI>Lui Jupiter vult perdere hos
dementat,</HI> his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was not to take one
right Step, or do any thing but what was to pre|cipitate
him&s;elf, and all his Friends into farther
Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="239">
AS &s;oon as King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> his People, receiv'd
the News, they &s;tood like Men Thunder-&s;truck,
looking at one another; the <HI>Poles</HI> that were with
him, and adheard to his Intere&s;t, began to con|&s;ult
their own Safety, and fled like <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> eve|ry
Man to his Tent; &s;o that of 12000 Hor&s;e, he
had in a Weeks time, &s;carce 2000 left, General
<HI>Cra&s;&s;an;</HI> with his <HI>Swedes,</HI> fore&s;eeing the Storm that
began immediately to gather behind him, I mean
from <HI>Saxony,</HI> and of which I &s;hall &s;peak at large
pre&s;ently, began to con&s;ider in what Part of the
World he was, namely in the remote&s;t Part of
<HI>Poland,</HI> that he had no Time to lo&s;e, and that if
he did not immediately &s;ecure the Pa&s;&s;ages into
<HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Pomerania,</HI> his Retreat might be cut
off, or he might be obliged to cut his Way
through with the Sword.</P>
<P>UPON this Con&s;ideration, he immediately put
him&s;elf in a Po&s;ture to Retreat, and by long
Marches, made towards great <HI>Poland;</HI> nay, he
made &s;uch Expedition, that it look'd as if he had
been pur&s;u'd by the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Army; but the
Truth of the Ca&s;e was, that he feared more his
Enemies that were before him, than tho&s;e that
were behind him; King <HI>Stani&s;laus</HI> went with him,
and glad he was to have &s;uch a Convoy; for he,
that a little before, had a great Body of Troops at
his Command, was glad now to take Shelter in a
<HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Camp, and to quit <HI>Poland,</HI> as fa&s;t as he
could, lea&s;t he &s;hould fall into the Hands of his
Rival.</P>
<P>AND this brings me to the Sum of the Affair
on that Side; the Victory of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
at <HI>Pultowa,</HI> had more Influence upon that remo|ter
Part of the World, by a great deal, than up|on
that Part where it was tran&s;acted; the <HI>Czar</HI>
<PB N="231" REF="240">
had nothing to do, but to &s;tand &s;till and &s;ee with
Plea&s;ure, the Con&s;equences of his Victory over
the whole Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> over the whole
Electorate of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and indeed over all <HI>Eu|rope.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE mention'd before how the Confede|rated
Nobility, call'd the a&s;&s;embly at <HI>Lublin,</HI> had
rejected the, Invitations of King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> and
how they met afterwards at <HI>Sendomir,</HI> and how even
after the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI> return into <HI>Poland,</HI> they
yet kept together, and took an Oath to &s;tand by
one another; tho' at the &s;ame time they would
not come into the Mea&s;ures, which the <HI>Czar</HI> would
have brought them to, <HI>viz,</HI> to Choo&s;e a third King
of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING is more certain than that this Con|federacy
were the Life of King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> Cau&s;e at
la&s;t, for they all a long kept a Corre&s;pondence
with him, and waited only an Opportunity to re|&s;tore
him to the Crown; nor were they without
very rational pro&s;pects of bringing it about, even
from the fir&s;t time, that they &s;aw the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> pur&s;ue &s;uch wild Chimerick Projects as
dethroning the <HI>Czar,</HI> marching into <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and
afterwards into <HI>Urkania;</HI> but e&s;pecially after
they found that the <HI>Czar,</HI> at the Head, but of a
Part of his Army had defeated General <HI>Lewen|haupt,</HI>
and &s;uch an Army of Soldiers as he had
with him, who were thought to be invincible, and
that all the Ammunition, and Millitary Provi&s;ions,
which were carrying to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> were,
fallen into the Hands of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians;</HI> the&s;e things
not only put the Confederated Nobility in Heart;
but they actually pur&s;ued the De&s;ign of bringing
back King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> let his Engagements &s;ubmit|ted
<PB N="232" REF="241">
to, when under Violence, and Oppo&s;ition of
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> be what they would.</P>
<P>&startq;ON the other Hand it was ea&s;ie to &s;ee for &s;ome
time before the Battle of <HI>Pultowa,</HI> that King
<HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> had form'd new De&s;igns, and was ta|king
Mea&s;ures for another Attempt upon <HI>Po|land,</HI>
he found that notwith&s;tanding the King of
<HI>Sweden's</HI> advance into <HI>Poland,</HI> he made no great
influence on the <HI>Poles;</HI> that the Nobility had an
univer&s;al hatred to King <HI>Stani&s;laus;</HI> he found
al&s;o, that altho' the <HI>Czar</HI> pu&s;h'd at a new Electi|on,
yet he could not, bring the <HI>Poles</HI> to con&s;ent to
it; but that they manife&s;ted an exceeding Af|fection
to his Per&s;on, and a great de&s;ire to &s;ee him
once again at the Head of his Armies in <HI>Poland;</HI>
the <HI>Czar</HI> al&s;o found he &s;hould never bring the
<HI>Poles</HI> to fall into a Conjunction with him, but
that the Intere&s;t of King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> reviv'd, and
that he could not with all his Art, no not by
threatening to abandon them to the <HI>Swedes,</HI> bring
them to publi&s;h an <HI>Interegnum,</HI> much le&s;s to
hear of a new Election; but that they owned
to him, that they knew as King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was
driven by violence to give up the Crown, &s;o
he would not be backward to take the fir&s;t op|portunity
to re-a&s;&s;ume it. The&s;e Con&s;iderati|ons
brought the <HI>Czar</HI> and King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> al&s;o to
a &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence, and even before the
Battle of <HI>Le&s;no,</HI> where Count <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> was
beaten; King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> who all the World ex|pected
would have retrench'd his Expences, and
le&s;&s;en'd his Troops to recover his Lo&s;ies, on a &s;ud|den
li&s;ted Men throughout all his Dominions,
and among all the Princes of his Hou&s;e, till he
had &s;uch an Army as all well knew the Revenues
of his own Country could not maintain, tho'
<PB N="233" REF="242">
it had been in the time of his greate&s;t Pro&s;peri|ty;
for he had rais'd above 30000 Men, where|of
at leaft 16000 were Hor&s;e; a Force which
it was apparent, was with &s;ome extraordinary
Enterpri&s;e in View: Certain it was, he could
not fore&s;ee the Defeat of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
neither could he expect with all the Forces,
which it was in his power to rai&s;e, to be able to
fight the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Forces; &s;o that if he had not
had &s;ome &s;ecret A&s;&s;urances, he could never have
been &s;o weak to have ventured a &s;econd. At|tempt,
after the fir&s;t had been &s;o fatal to him;
It is true, when by the frequent going, and re|turning
of Courriers to and from the <HI>Czar</HI> of
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and from publick
Conferences held with the Mini&s;ter of the <HI>Czar</HI>
at <HI>Dre&s;den,</HI> &s;ome umbrage was taken, that he
was forming new De&s;igns in Concert with the
<HI>Czar</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t, he endeavour'd
to take off tho&s;e Apprehen&s;ions by publickly
declaring there was no De&s;igns of that kind on
Foot; ordering his Mini&s;ter at the Court of <HI>Ber|lin</HI>
to &s;ignifie to his <HI>Pru&s;ian</HI> Maje&s;ty, that the
Rea&s;on of tho&s;e Conferences, and Di&s;patches,
were only to $ettle &s;ome mutual Preten&s;ions
between him, and the <HI>Czar;</HI> particularly, as to
<HI>Patkull's</HI> Papers, and Writings belonging to his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, which were in the Hands of
a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary, who died at <HI>Dre&s;den;</HI>
The&s;e were the An&s;wers given upon tho&s;e Occa|&s;ions;
but we found not long afterwards that
this fir&s;t was only to amuze the Courts of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
till his De&s;igns were ripe for Execution;
for no &s;ooner was Count <HI>Lewenhaupt</HI> defeated
at <HI>Le&s;no,</HI> as has been &s;aid, and the <HI>Swedi&s;h.</HI>
Communication with <HI>Poland</HI> cut off, the <HI>Czar</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="243">
&s;ending Word to King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> that he had the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> at an Advantage, and that he
would an&s;wer for giving a good Account of him.
I &s;ay, no &s;ooner were the&s;e Appearances of Suc|ce&s;s
in his View, but King <HI>Augun&s;tus</HI> began to
discover him&s;elf; the great and open Concour&s;e
of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nobility to his Court, the fre|quent
Expre&s;&s;es &s;ent to <HI>Cracow,</HI> where the No|bility
in his Intere&s;t were A&s;&s;embled; the vi&s;i|ble
Concert of Mea&s;ures with the Crown Ge|neral,
and the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army, and &s;everal other
Circum&s;tances made it no longer doubted but
that he had re&s;olv'd to return into <HI>Poland;</HI> but
as &s;oon as he had receiv'd by Expre&s;s from the
<HI>Czar,</HI> on Account of the Battle of <HI>Pultowa,</HI> and
of the entire defeat of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army, as
you have heard, with the Flight of his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions; he then
threw off the Mask, and made his De&s;igns no
longer a Secret.&endq;</P>
<P>BUT this went farther immediately, for now
the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nobility throng'd to <HI>Dre&s;den,</HI> to make
their Court to the King, and to tender their Ser|vice
to him, and a little after this came a &s;olemn
Deputation from the Crown Army, and from the
Confederate Nobility at <HI>Sendomir,</HI> to invite him
to return to his People, and to take upon him a|gain
the Governvent; promi&s;ing all the Obedi|ence
and Fidelity of Loyal Subjects, and to &s;et
him upon the Throne again, and maintain him
thereon again&s;t all his Enemies what&s;oever.</P>
<P>UPON all the&s;e Encouragements he could do no
le&s;s than con&s;ent, &s;o he receiv'd the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Deputati|on,
acquainted them with his Re&s;olution to return
into <HI>Poland,</HI> and at the &s;ame time &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;ador
$the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> to Congratulate him upon
<PB N="235" REF="244">
the News of his Victory, and to acquaint him
with his new Mea&s;ures, de&s;iring his Concur|rence,
and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which was only matter of
Form, all that Part having been concerted, and
concluded between them long before his Prepa|rations.</P>
<P>IT is time now to look back to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty's
Proceedings after the great Battle at <HI>Pul|towa;</HI>
the fir&s;t thing was to &s;end a &s;trong Body
of Troops over the <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> to pu&s;h the flying
Enemy; this Party pick'd up &s;ome &s;traglers, but
the chief Service was to hurry the King of <HI>Swed|land</HI>
forward, who hearing of tho&s;e Troops in
his Rear, would be &s;ure not to return towards
<HI>Poland,</HI> which was the only thing that the <HI>Czar</HI>
was unwilling &s;hould happen.</P>
<P>SOME of the &s;tragling <HI>Swedes,</HI> who e&s;caped
from the Battle, fell into the Hands of a <HI>Mu&s;co|vite</HI>
Officer, who was po&s;ted on the Frontier of
<HI>Polodia,</HI> who attack'd them, and after a &s;hort,
but bloody Engagement, the <HI>Swedes,</HI> of whom
about 120 were kill'd, &s;urrendered, and were
made Pri&s;oners, being about 250 Men; but as
for about 800 <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> General looking
on them as Rebels, and Traytors, would give
them no Quarter, but they were all cut in Pieces.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Kiou</HI> was the only Man that
&s;tood firm for King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> even after he had
receiv'd News of the Lo&s;s at <HI>Pultowa,</HI> and after
the Retreat of the &s;aid King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> and of
General <HI>Cra&s;&s;au,</HI> as above; but as his Forces were
&s;mall, he was fallen upon by a Deteachment from
the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army and entirely defeated, and fled
afterward to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> at <HI>Bender.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was that <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Kiou,</HI> who brought
the <HI>Cham</HI> of the <HI>Tartars</HI> and the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="245">
together, and &s;o wrought with the <HI>Cham,</HI> and
thro' his means with that <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperor, that
he brought the <HI>Czar</HI> into the fatal War with the
<HI>Turks,</HI> in which he had that Misfortune to pur|cha&s;e
Peace with the Lo&s;s of that important For|tre&s;e
of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> and there-with of all that pro|&s;pect
the <HI>Czar</HI> had of Commerce, and Conque$t on
the Side of the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> of which &s;o much has
been &s;aid in the beginning of this Hi&s;tory, and of
which we &s;hall have more to &s;ay very quickly.</P>
<P>IT might take up &s;ome time here to look into
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and take &s;ome Notice of the rejoycings
there, upon the News of this Victory and the
Triumph of the <HI>Czar</HI> at his return to <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> his
Capital City; but I &s;hall Couch it all in this
&s;hort Abridgement at pre&s;ent, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it was
&s;uch as it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> were not a little in pain at fir&s;t,
on the approach of &s;uch a Prince, and &s;uch an
Army, as Fame had repre&s;ented the King of <HI>Swe|den</HI>
and his Army to be; and at the Apprehen&s;i|ons
of that very Prince approaching them, who
had &s;o terribly defeated them at the Battle of
<HI>Narva;</HI> and to have an Account that this Prince
was beaten, and that in &s;uch a manner, as &s;carce
ever Army was beaten before, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;o that none
at all of &s;o great a Power &s;hould e&s;cape, except
&s;uch a trifling Number as is mentioned to have
gone away with that King; this mu&s;t be &s;urpri|&s;ing
(to be &s;ure) to them, &s;ince it was &s;o to all the
World.</P>
<P>BUT the Triumph of their Prince exceeded all
the re&s;t, and indeed his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had as
much Rea&s;on to Triumph as ever any <HI>Roman</HI>
Con&s;ul, or <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor had for the greate&s;t
Victory they ever won; for the <HI>Romans</HI> exceeded
<PB N="237" REF="246">
in Military Knowledge, and the Experience of
Wars of all the Nations of the World; but here was
a Prince, and even a Nation, who were, as it
might be &s;aid, but as of Ye&s;terday in War, yet
victorious over the brave&s;t and mo&s;t experienc'd
Soldiers then thought to be in the World: In a
Word, it was a Victory that the World thought
impo&s;&s;ible; the Scholars beating their Ma&s;ters
the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> beating the <HI>Swedes,</HI> was like the <HI>Gauls</HI>
beating the <HI>Romans;</HI> which was the Wonder of
the World.</P>
<P>AS the Glory of the Victory was great, &s;o,
the <HI>Czar</HI> being willing his Subjects &s;hould &s;ee
what their Monarch had fought &s;o boldly for, and
to &s;how familliarly to them the Affair of War, he
let them &s;ee the Trophies which he brought, and
what had been purcha&s;ed at the Expence of their
Blood. This glorious Triumph was made the
21&s;t of <HI>December,</HI> 1701, and is here &s;et down at large, from the mo&s;t Authentick Account.</P>
<P>On the 11th, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty attended by
Admiral <HI>Aparxin,</HI> and &s;everal of the Nobility,
arriv'd at a Country Seat, call'd <HI>Kolem&s;ki,</HI> which
is about five <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI>
Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> went thither on the 14th, and
on the 16th, the whole Court took up their Lodg|ings
in one of the Suburbs which is &s;eparated
from the Town by the River <HI>Mo&s;cow;</HI> his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty had appointed to receive the Compli|ments
of all the Foreign Mini&s;ters on the 17th,

<P>THIS la&s;t was an Undertaking of great Impor|tance,

&s;trong by &s;ituation, and that &s;ituation improv'd
<PB N="242" REF="251">
with the otmo&s;t Art; it had a numerous Artille|ry,
a &s;trong Fort, or rather Fortre&s;s command|ing
the Entrance to it by Sea, call'd the <HI>Duna|muder
&s;cans,</HI> being indeed a Royal Citadel, exquir|&s;itely
Fortified, and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible; it was
reported that there was in the City and the <HI>Shcans</HI>
a Garri&s;on of 10000 Men, including the Burghers,
who did Duty as Soldiers, commanded by General
<HI>Stromfield,</HI> an experienced Officer, and a Man
from whom the World expected all that became
a Man of Honour, and of the utmo&s;t Bravery.</P>
<P>BUT all this was far from Discouraging the
<HI>Czar</HI> from the attempt; he knew the importance
of the Enterpri&s;e, and that now was the critical
Juncture, in which it was to be Undertaken,
with a pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s; the Affairs of <HI>Swe|den</HI>
being in &s;uch Confu&s;ion, that he was very
&s;ure to meet with no Interruption from without,
his Maje&s;ty therefore re&s;olv'd on the Seige.</P>
<P>THIS Siege was begun by Field Mar&s;hal <HI>Cere|mettoff,</HI>
but was after &s;ome time &s;top'd, and af|terwards
carried on only by a Bombardment and
Blockade, in order to &s;ave the effu&s;ion of Blood;
it was certain that there was time enough before
them to reduce the Garri&s;on to Extremity, no
Relief being likely to come to the Place by Sea,
and none po&s;&s;ible to be brought by Land; at the
beginning of this Blockade a mo&s;t lamentable Dif|&s;a&s;ter
befel the Be&s;ieg'd, in which the Be&s;iegers
had no hand at all; for the 22d of <HI>January</HI> the
Labratory where the Engineers made their Fire|works,
and fill'd their Bombs, which was built in
the Rear of the Ba&s;tions, adjoyning to one of the
Magazines belonging to the Garri&s;on took fire by
accident, and the fire reaching one of the shells
it bur&s;t, and in an in&s;tant the whole Hou&s;e, with
<PB N="243" REF="252">
the Magazine, adjoyning, blew up into the Air
with a Bla&s;t that &s;hoke the whole City, and made
even the Earth as far as the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Camp trem|ble:
There was, 800 Barrels of Gunpowder in the
Magazine, be&s;ides what was in the Labratory;
and be&s;ides the Shells which were fill'd; the Con|&s;ternation
in the City was inexpre&s;&s;ible, not a
a Hou&s;e but &s;uffer'd, and the whole Place look'd
like a City in Ruins; of the Garri&s;on the Bar|racks
being near the Place, 600 Men were entire|ly
lo&s;t, including the Guard of the Ba&s;tion; the
Ba&s;tion it &s;elf was entirely ruined, and the great
Ho&s;pital, in which was 1200 &s;ick or wounded Sol|diers,
be&s;ides the Officers of the Hou&s;e attending
them was blown up, and not a Soul of them all
left a live; &s;o that in the whole, near 2000 Peo|ple
were de&s;troyed, be&s;ides &s;uch as were wounded
an other Parts of the Town.</P>
<P>THE Governor under the greate&s;t &s;urpri&s;e of
Mind, as well as influenced by the Bla&s;t being on
the Parade of the Place, giving orders for a Sa|lly
fell down as one dead; and when by proper
Applications he recovered him&s;elf, he could not
hear, no not the Noi&s;e of a Drum; he had no Notion
for a great while, but that a Mine had been Sprung
by the Enemy under the Ba&s;tion, and that they
would immediately Storm the Breach.</P>
<P>THE force of the Powder had not only blown up
the Ba&s;tion, but it had made a Breach in the Bo|dy
of the Place nine or ten Yards wide, &s;o that e|ven
the Hor&s;e might have come in; the re&s;t
of the Officers, while things were in this Extre|mity,
being under no &s;uch great Concern, and
Con&s;equently le&s;s &s;urpris'd, than the Governour,
re&s;olv'd &s;ooner what was to be done, and beat|ing
to Arms, rais'd the whole Garri&s;on to defend
<PB N="244" REF="253">
the Place if they &s;hould be attack'd; then they
caus'd all the Hor&s;e Dung and Litter, which could
be had to be brought to the Place, and made up
the Breach in the Ba&s;tion as well as time could
permit, &s;etting three Rows of Palli&s;&s;adoes before
the Breach, and making a large Coupre or Re|trenchment
behind it; &s;o that tho' the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> had
they been aware of the Blow, might have made an
Advantage of it; yet &s;uch was the Diligence of
The Garri&s;on, that they made it up, as above, the
&s;ame Night that the Di&s;&s;a&s;ter happen'd; nor could
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Generals make any advantage of it.</P>
<P>THE Blockade of this Place held till the latter
End of <HI>July,</HI> 1710, when General <HI>Stromfield,</HI> the
Governor was oblig'd to Capitulate, the Garri&s;on
being reduc'd by Hunger, and hard Service, and
by the fire of the Bombs, together with the Di&s;|&s;a&s;ter
above-mention'd, to le&s;&s; than 2000 &s;ound
Men; the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Velt Mar&s;hal gave them honour|able
Conditions, as well for the Garri&s;on, as to the
Burghers and Inhabitants, Courts of Ju&s;tice, and
Nobility, to whom all their Priviledges, Judica|tories,
and civil Rights were continu'd and pre|&s;erved;
as to the Garri&s;on, they were allowed all
Soldierly Honours, and to be conducted to <HI>Revel,</HI>
upon Condition neverthele&s;s, that they &s;hould Em|bark

<P>THIS <HI>Circular letter</HI> was publi&s;h'd by King <HI>Au|gu&s;tus,</HI>
at the Head of his Army as &s;oon as he
enter'd <HI>Poland,</HI> and it was annex'd to a long <HI>Mani|fe&s;to,</HI>
and to a like <HI>Circular Letter</HI> to the Nobility
and Clergy of <HI>Lithuania</HI> inviting them to come

and promi&s;ing his Amni&s;ty, or Pardon, even to
tho&s;e who had joyn'd King <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> and acted
again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Poles</HI> embraced this latter part, with al|mo&s;t
an universal Con&s;ent, and the King of <HI>Poland</HI>
was received with all the Care&s;&s;es, and all the
Tokens of Zeal and Affection imaginable; as to
the particulars, &s;uch as the va&s;t Concour&s;e of the
Nobility to him at <HI>War&s;aw,</HI> and the Harangues,
Speeches, Compliments, and Promi&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made
to him, by tho&s;e that attended his Court at <HI>War|&s;aw,</HI>
they relate more particularly to the Hi&s;tory
of King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and I therefore refer the Rea|der
to other Writers of them; only ob&s;erving that
in the Cour&s;e even of his Hi&s;tory, we may per|haps
&s;ee of how little importance, Vows and Pro|te&s;tations
of Sincerity, Loyalty, and Fidelity
are in this Age, in tho&s;e Parts of the World.</P>
<P>BUT leaving the&s;e things, it follows of Cour&s;e
now to carry our Hi&s;tory farther from his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty's &s;hare of acting than before, and go as
far as <HI>Denmark</HI> to find another Allie in this War,
in who&s;e Territories, we &s;hall quickly find his
Maje&s;ty obliged to act, as well in Per&s;on as by his
Armies and Navies, and to make a yet more
con&s;iderable Figure in the War, than ever he did be|fore.</P>
<P>IT has been mention'd in the beginning of this
Work, how far the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was an Allie
with the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and with his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty,
<PB N="251" REF="260">
in the beginning of the War with <HI>Sweden;</HI> how
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ting the <HI>Swedes</HI> by Sea,
and the Troops of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lunenburg</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ting
the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> by Land, the King of <HI>Den|mark</HI>
was forced to make a Di&s;advantageous Peace
with both <HI>Sweden</HI> and <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> and have the Mor|tification
to &s;ee his Conque&s;t in <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> &s;natch'd
out of his Hands, to rai&s;e his Siege of <HI>Toningen,</HI>
and to &s;ee the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> under the Protecti|on
of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Squadrons Land ju&s;t
at his Palace Gate, and Bombard his capital City
of <HI>Copenhagen.</HI></P>
<P>BUT now the Tables were turn'd, the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> was, as it were, out of the World, and
the <HI>Czar</HI> the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Allie, and fa&s;t
Friend, was Victorious, and very Formidable; now
his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Denmark</HI> thought it was a Juncture
happily offer'd by Heaven, for him to pu&s;h the
<HI>Swedes</HI> in his Turn, and to retrieve the Di&s;honour
which he had &s;uffer'd, and that he had as ju&s;t Rea|&s;on,
to Break with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as the
King of <HI>Poland</HI> had, who&s;e Ca&s;e was many Ways
the &s;ame.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e Thoughts, and concerting Mat|ters
with his <HI>Czar&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as
well by Sea as by Land, he re&s;olv'd to break
with <HI>Sweden</HI> immediately, and according to the
King of <HI>Poland</HI>'s Method, his <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
publi&s;h'd al&s;o a Manife&s;to, of the Rea&s;ons for
his Re&s;olution; this, as being not to our pre&s;ent
Purpo&s;e, I omit, and only mention it to Intro|duce
the Story of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Part in
this War, which follow'd after.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Denmark</HI> having declar'd &startq;War,
and brought a con&s;iderable Army together, re|&s;olv'd
to pa&s;s over with them to <HI>S$honen,</HI> a Pro|vince
<PB N="252" REF="261">
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> once belonging to <HI>Denmark,</HI>
but Conquer'd formerly by the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
and conceded to <HI>Sweden,</HI> by the Treaty of Ro&s;|child.</P>
<P>TO bring this Abridgment of the Hi&s;tory of
this War into a narrow Compa&s;s, it is to be ob|&s;erv'd,
that the <HI>Swedes</HI> being at fir&s;t &s;urpriz'd, to be
thus attack'd, were at fir&s;t under great Apprehen|&s;ions,
but General, Count <HI>Steinhock,</HI> one of the
<HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Officers at the Battle of <HI>Pultowa,</HI> and who
made his E&s;cape out of that Battle, being ap|pointed
to Command the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army, gave
Battle to the <HI>Danes,</HI> under the Walls of <HI>Hel&s;ing|burgh</HI>
in <HI>Schonen,</HI> and entirely defeated their
whole Army, taking all their Cannon, Baggage,
and Ammunition, and forcing the Remainder of
their Army, to embark as well as the could, on
board &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships in the <HI>Sound,</HI> and get
over into <HI>Jutland,</HI> and to <HI>Ele&s;nore,</HI> to &s;ave their
Lives; the <HI>Swedes</HI> kill'd in this Battle, about
3000 Men, and took near 4000 Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>THIS Victory deliver'd <HI>Sweden</HI> effectually,
for a time; but the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who burn'd
with an impatient De&s;ire of Revenge, not
being equal to his Enemies, enter'd into a
Treaty with his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, to be &s;upply'd
with 8000 Men, who were to be Convey'd to
<HI>Copenhagen</HI> by Sea.</P>
<P>IT now comes in the Event of Things, to take
Notice that the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> having, as has
been fail, built a Royal City on the <HI>Neva,</HI> and a
Fortre&s;s defending the Port, by which it was effectulaly
&s;ecur'd, &s;o as to be able to receive and
protect any Number of the bige&s;t Ships. His
Maje&s;ty who&s;e Genius for the Sea Service, has
been &s;ufficiently mentioned, re&s;olv'd to build
<PB N="253" REF="262">
him&s;elf a Royal Navy; and to that Purpo&s;e,
having now made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Narva,</HI> and
<HI>Riga, Wyborg,</HI> and <HI>Revel,</HI> and other Places on that
Coa&s;t, he thereby got great Supplies of Seamen,
be&s;ides what he hir'd at other places.</P>
<P>IN a Word, &s;uch Expedition his Maje&s;ty made
in building Ships of his own, and employing al&s;o
&s;everal Per&s;ons to buy Ships of great Burthen,
in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> which he fitted up as Ships
of War; that by this Means his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
began to haVe a Fleet at Sea, as well as the <HI>Swedes</HI>
and <HI>Danes,</HI> tho' not at fir&s;t of &s;o great Ships; tho'
now he has built &s;o many noble, large, beautiful
Men of War, that he di&s;pi&s;es tho&s;e bought Ships,
which being built generally for Merchants Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and not for the War, were not &s;o u&s;eful as
tho&s;e which he built.</P>
<P>FOR the effectual Furni&s;hing the&s;e Ships with
experienced Seamen, for managing them, his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was not di&s;maid with the Impo&s;|&s;ibility;
he got Men for Money, in almo&s;t all Parts
of <HI>Europe:</HI> And thus his Men of War appear'd in
the <HI>Baltick</HI> in this <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> War, of which we &s;hall
&s;ay more in its Place, &s;ooner than could have
been imagin'd: From the&s;e Beginnings, his <HI>Czar|i&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty has rai&s;ed him&s;elf to that formidable
Po&s;ture in his Marine Affairs, which we &s;ee him in at Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>BY the Conver&s;ing with, and by Direction of the
foreign Seamen, which his Maje&s;ty has entertain'd
in his Pay, his own Subjects are gradually bred up
to thte Sea, and are found to be as expert in guid|ing
the Ships, and as bold and daring in Fight,
as can be de&s;ir'd of them; and even the Men, fol|lowing
in that, the Genius of their Sovereign, appear
pleas'd and delighted with the Service,
<PB N="254" REF="263">
and with Maritime Affairs; &s;o that now his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty has many Thou&s;and able Seamen of his
own Subjects, and will in a few Years have as
many Thou&s;and more as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>TO furni&s;h him&s;elf with Ships he had nothing
to do but to furni&s;h him&s;elf with Builders, and
Carpenterps, having all the Materials for building
with in him&s;elf, and able to furni&s;h all the Nati|ons
of the World, be&s;ides: Naval Stores of all
kinds are the natural Produce of his Country,
and our Ea&s;t Country Merchants know very well,
that even the Royal Navies of great <HI>Britain, Hol|land,
Frarce</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> are furni&s;h'd with Hemp,
Flax, Timber Pla$k Pitch and Tar, from his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty's Dominions, and as for his Iron, which is
the only thing wanting, he has enough in his own
Country, if they plea&s;e but to dig for it, and of
Copper al&s;o.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's known Diligence in
the&s;e things is &s;uch, and his Application has been
follow'd with &s;o much Succc&s;s, that the Li&s;t of
his Fleet, as I have &s;een it in the latter End of the
Year 1720, was thus,
<LIST>
<ITEM>36 Ships of the Line, from 50 to 104
Guns each.</ITEM>
<ITEM>28 Frrgates, from 12 to 40 Guns each.</ITEM>
<ITEM>20 Brigantines and Sloops, from 4 to 10
Guns each.</ITEM>
<ITEM>360 Gallies for Tran&s;porting Soldiers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>120 Tran&s;port-Ships, and Ships employ'd in
fetching Timber, and Naval Materials from
<HI>Riga</HI> to <HI>Petersburg.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<Q>Be&s;ides hir'd Ships.</Q>
<P>IF this Li&s;t he a true One, I refer the Reader
to any, or all the Hi&s;tories in the World, to find
<PB N="255" REF="264">
out one Example of any Prince in the World,
who from having not one Ship, or one Sea-Port in
tho&s;e Seas, did in &s;o &s;hort time furni&s;h out &s;uch a
Navy, and bring a Nation, who before knew little
or nothing of the Sea, and had neither Genius for
it, or Notion of it, to be Ma&s;ters of the Bu&s;ine&s;s, ex|pert
and able Seamen, and equal, if not Superi|or
to all his Neighbours of the <HI>Baltick.</HI></P>
<P>IT was but three Years between his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty
having not one Ship, and a &s;trong Navy,
not one Port in tho&s;e Seas, and be Ma&s;ter of &s;ix
of the &s;tronge&s;t Port Towns in the North, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<HI>Riga, Pernau, Revel, Narva, Petersburg</HI> and <HI>Wy|bourg.</HI></P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> as I have noted had
declared again&s;t <HI>Sweden,</HI> and had Landed an Ar|my
in <HI>Sc$honen,</HI> but was driven out again by plain
Force, and his Army entirely routed, and cut in
Peices at the great Battle of <HI>Hel&s;ingburg:</HI> This
throws him into the Arms of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty,
who was now become the general Refuge of op|pre&s;s'd
Monarrhs, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty embracing
all occa&s;ions to Support the Enemies of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
went in Per&s;on to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, where a &s;econd
De&s;cent upon <HI>Schonen,</HI> was re&s;olved, and his Ma|je&s;ty
carried &s;uch a Fleet, and &s;uch an Army to
a&s;&s;i&s;t in that Work, that had been more than &s;uf|ficient
to have reduc'd the whole Kingdom of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> rather than a Province, which attempt,
how it was laid a&s;ide, and why, and what the
Con&s;equences of it were, we may &s;ee farther that
the relating the Story, of which in its turn.</P>
<P>BUT we mu&s;t now turn our Eyes to the Ea&s;t
and the South, from whence new Enemies were
rais'd up by the indefatigable bu&s;tle of the King
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Kio$u,</HI> of whom I took
<PB N="256" REF="265">
Notice, that being defeated he fled to <HI>Bender,</HI>
after the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was now come to <HI>Bender,</HI>
where the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> receiv'd him Civily, but would
not go any Length in protecting and &s;uccouring
him, without Orders, and therefore &s;ent a <HI>Chioux</HI>
Expre&s;s to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> for farther Instructions,
in the Affair of the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> the An&s;wer
to which, was, an expre&s;s Order to &s;hew the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;pect, to a&s;&s;ure him of
the Protection of the <HI>Grand Senior,</HI> and to a&s;&s;ign
him a Place to re&s;ide in, near the Town; and to
defray his Expence, and the Expence of all his
Retinue, out of the Publick Trea&s;ure; &s;ending
at the &s;ame time, a Me&s;&s;enger to the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> to condole the Nece&s;&s;ity of his Flight,
and to a&s;&s;ure him of a powerful Protection from
the Grand <HI>Signior;</HI> with his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as far as he
was able to re&s;tore his Affairs: This was brought
at the fir&s;t Enterance of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> into
the <HI>Turk</HI>'s Dominions, but the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
found Means afterwards, to put the whole <HI>Turk|i&s;h</HI>
Government into a Ferment, by the Means
of the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> and the Platine of
<HI>Kiow</HI> above-nam'd.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems, the Palatine was an Intimate of
the <HI>Tartar</HI> Prince, and receiv'd &s;ignal Favours
from him, upon the fir&s;t News of his Misfor|tunes,
and &s;ome time after, the Palatine took
a Journey to the Camp of the <HI>Cham,</HI> to return his
Acknowledgement, but principally to &s;et$ on
Foot the Conferences, which afterwards produc'd
&s;uch remarkable Events.</P>
<P>AT this Interview, the Palatine firmly in|gaged
the <HI>Tartar</HI> Prince, in the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI>
Intere&s;t; and from that Time forward, they
<PB N="257" REF="266">
meditated together, the proper Mea&s;ures for bring|ing
in the Port to the &s;ame Sentiments, and to
break, if po&s;&s;ible, the Peace between the <HI>Grand
Seignior</HI> and the <HI>Czar,</HI> and bring a War upon the
<HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI></P>
<P>THEY had Room to In&s;inuate the exorbitant
growing Greatne&s;s of the <HI>Czar,</HI> upon this Defeat
of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> the Danger which hung
over the Head of the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire
from the encrea&s;e of Naval Power in the <HI>Black
Sea;</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> building a Royal Navy at <HI>Veronitz,</HI>
his Fortifying of <HI>Azoph,</HI> and threatening, even
the imperial City of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS with &s;ome other, and more powerful
Motives, inflam'd the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> who fail'd
not to have them repre&s;ented with Advantage to
the Grand <HI>Vizier,</HI> Embarking the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Bender</HI>

Envoy from the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> others, That
he was &s;ent by the <HI>Cham,</HI> or <HI>Han</HI> of <HI>Tartary.</HI> Be
that as it will, `tis certain that they manag'd
their Affairs &s;o artfully, that a grand <HI>Divan</HI> was
call'd at <HI>Con&s;tantinpole;</HI> the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> the
<HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> the <HI>Muffty,</HI> and the <HI>Captain Ba&s;&s;a,</HI>

that a&s;&s;i&s;ting the <HI>Swede,</HI> and declaring again&s;t

was the only Cri&s;is, when it might be effectual|ly
brought to pa&s;s, and when the <HI>Czar</HI> would
nece&s;&s;arily be reduc'd, and all the Danger ap|prehended
from him, be avoided, and return'd
upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="267">
IT was about the middle of <HI>November,</HI> 1710,

the Palatine of <HI>Kiou</HI> had a great Sum of Money

done on the Side of <HI>England,</HI> and that the <HI>Czar</HI>
had Ju&s;tice on his Side, nothing was omitted that
could rea&s;onably be done, to give his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty
Satisfaction; the Ca&s;e was about an Affront
put on the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Amba&s;&s;adour, by &s;ome Trade&s;men
here, who very ra&s;hly, and without con&s;idering
as they ought to have done, the publick Character
he carryed, Arre&s;ted Mon&s;ieur <HI>Matteuoff,</HI> the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI>
Amba&s;&s;ador, and in&s;ulted him very rudely, al&s;o
detaining him in Cu&s;tody for &s;ome Time.</P>
<P>THIS we mu&s;t not over-look; the Story is thus,
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Andrew Matteuoff,</HI> was Emba&s;&s;ador
Re&s;ident to her Maje&s;ty the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI>
from the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy:</HI> Upon &s;ome Occa&s;ion
or other, he was Arre&s;ted, as above, by &s;ome private
Per&s;ons; who finding his Excellency had had
Audience of Leave of the Queen, and was going
<PB N="260" REF="269">
away; and imagining, or pretending to imagine,
he would leave the Kingdom, as it were in Cog|nito,
without paying a few Debts which he ow'd;
imploy'd &s;ome Bayliffs to Arre&s;t him; the Am|ba&s;&s;ador
ju&s;tly &s;urpris'd at this Treatment, in
Relation to the Laws of Nations; and perhaps
not &s;o readily &s;ubmitting to the &s;top, was very
roughly handled by tho&s;e &s;ort <HI>Canibals:</HI> Upon
which, he made Application for Redre&s;s to her
Maje&s;ty, and her Council, who immediately
took Care to confine tho&s;e Fellows, who had
thus, in Contempt of Authority, put this Affront
upon him. There were various Stories which
flew about, in Reference to the Particulars of
Reparation in&s;i&s;ted on, by his Excellency, which
I &s;hall not trouble my &s;elf to repeat. But in
&s;hort, his Excellency, at la&s;t, &s;eem'd to be a lit|tle
&s;atisfy'd; and her Maje&s;ty, even after his De|parture,
order'd her Attorney-General, a little
before the Beginning of that <HI>Micaelmas</HI> Term, to
pro&s;ecute tho&s;e who had been guilty in that Par|ticular,
in the <HI>Queen's-Bench</HI> Court. That this
was all that could be done, was certain; but
how little the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador was &s;atisfy'd
with it, will appear by the following Letters,
which pa&s;s'd between Mr. <HI>Henry Boyle,</HI> now Lord
<HI>Charleton,</HI> then Secretary of State, and the &s;aid
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mattueoff,</HI> who was retir'd to <HI>Holland;</HI>
and by which the whole of the fir&s;t Part of that
tedious Story may be fully under&s;tood; the fir&s;t

after having obtain'd an Audience of Leave of your
Maje&s;ty, at <HI>London,</HI> the Place of your Re&s;idence;
out of premeditated Malice, and of &s;et Purpo&s;e, (as
<PB N="269" REF="278">
it appears) was &s;et upon in the open Street, by &s;everal
Bailiffs, who receiv'd their Commi&s;&s;ion from a certain
Vi&s;count or Sheriff, and acted like Robbers again&s;t
the Publick Laws of Nations, with an unheard of,
and unparallell'd Barbarity: For by Di&s;per&s;ing his
Servants, violently breaking his Coach, taking away
his Sword, Cane and Hat, and tearing his Cloaths;
put, upon him &s;uch a notorious Affront as no civil|liz'd
Per&s;on would pre&s;ume to offer to a foreign Mini|&s;ter
of his Character; nor even to a Commoner, unle&s;s
he would run the Ri&s;que of being Mo&s;t &s;everely pu|ni&s;h'd:
And what mo&s;t of all inhances the Heinou&s;|ne&s;s
of the Fact, while our &s;aid Amba&s;&s;ador, crying
out for Help, again&s;t the Outrage and Robbery, had
got together &s;ome Per&s;ons, who intended to re&s;cue
him out of the Hands of the Pillagers; and when
they, for that Purpo&s;e, bad &s;topp'd the Coach, and
being de&s;irous to know the Cau&s;e, brought him into
the next Victualling Hou&s;e, the audacious Mi&s;creants,
produc'd a Warrant to detain the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;ador,
for the Sum of 50 l. Sterling, due from him, to cer|tain
Merchants: And when the People, who ran
together, began to &s;eparate again, upon the Di&s;covery
of the Matter; they forthwith hurry'd him into a
Hackney Coach, taken by Force, and delivered him
up to be confin'd in a certain Infamous Hou&s;e, call'd

had notify'd this unheard of, and flagitious Out|rage,
to the Secretary of State, neverthele&s;s, he could
not be found; and Secretary <HI>Walpole,</HI> only came
to the Hou&s;e, not to &s;et him at Liberty, (as mo&s;t
evidently appears) but to be an Eye Witne&s;s of this
U&s;age; the like of which, was never &s;een under the
Sun; neither did he offer any A&s;&s;i&s;tance to our Am|ba&s;&s;adour,
as a Per&s;on &s;kill'd in the publick Law of
Nations, which Protects the Character of an Ainba&s;&s;a|dor
<PB N="270" REF="279">
from all manner of In&s;ults, but went away: So
that our &s;aid Amba&s;&s;ador being de&s;titute of all Help,
and for&s;aken, was forced to Redeem him&s;elf, from
the Hou&s;e of Bondage; and after a long Space of
Time, to procure his Liberty.</P>
<P>Fora&s;much, then, as our Maje&s;ty is apparently
a&s;&s;aulted, by thi$ wicked Attempt and Indignity, put
upon the Per&s;on of our Amba&s;&s;adour, &s;uch as was
never practi&s;ed nor even heard of in the whole World;
much le&s;s among civiliz'd People; not only profain|ing,
but quite &s;ubverting the Law of Nations.
Therefore hoping that your Royal Maje&s;ty will have
due Regard, to the grievous Affront offer'd to us, in
the Per&s;on of our Amba&s;&s;ador, together with the In|fringement
of the Law of Nations, occa&s;ion'd primal|ly
by the Sheriff, as the Author of the whole Mi&s;|chief,
inasmuch, as the &s;aid Sheriff countenanc'd &s;o

Bailiff who pre&s;um'd to abu&s;e our &s;aid Amba&s;&s;ador
in the open Street, after the above-mention'd Manner.
And la&s;tly, by the Merchants, who occa&s;ion'd his
Confinement, (as is evident from their malevolent

to Con&s;ent, for an Example to others, a diligent
Search may be made after the re&s;t of the Accompli|ces
of the Crime, and that a capital Puni&s;hment ac|cording
to the rigour of the Law, be in$$icted on them
all, or at lea&s;t &s;uch a one, as is adequate to the Na|ture
of the Affront, which every Particular Per&s;on
put upon the Amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="280">

largely explain our Reque&s;t to your Maje&s;ty, which

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;I Did not think Fit to return a Speedy An|wer,
to the two Letters of the 27th of
<HI>November,</HI> and 4th of <HI>December</HI> la&s;t, <HI>N. S.</HI> with
which your Excellency was pleas'd to Honour
me; becau&s;e I could not inform you, what Sa|tisfacton
our Laws would afford, again&s;t tho&s;e
who put that grievous Affront upon your Excel|lency's
Per&s;on: But fora&s;much, as-I am appre|hen&s;ive
that too long a Silence, may be taken for
want of due Re&s;pect for your Excellency; or,
that I have net been &s;ufficiently &s;olicitous to put
in Execution, every thing that is incumbent
upon the Queen's Maje&s;ty, in order to procure
the promis'd Reparation: I could no longer for|bear
making An&s;wer to your Excellency, to
a&s;&s;ure you, that the Re&s;entment you expre&s;s of
the outragious Affront, particularly in your
Letter, of the 27th of <HI>November</HI> ult. Cannot
be greater, than the Indignation which her Maje&s;ty
has conceiv'd upon that Account; and I
doubt not, but Mr. <HI>de Ayrolle,</HI> according to the
Inructions he receiv'd, has already notify'd to
your Excellency, that the indi&s;pen&s;able Forms
of the Laws of this Kingdom, cannot admit of a
final Determination of that Affair, till the
next Se&s;&s;ions of our Court of Judicature, which
is &s;o well known, and &s;o firmly regulated here,
that in order to puni&s;h any Malefactor, for the
mo&s;t enormous Crimes, even Trea&s;on again&s;t
<PB N="273" REF="282">
her Maje&s;ty's Sacred Per&s;on, he mu&s;t be brought
to his Tryal, according to u&s;ual Forms e&s;tabli&s;h'd
in this Country: I am per&s;waded that
your Excellency's Saga&s;ity and Equitablene&s;s,
will di&s;tingui&s;h between the In&s;olence and Bru|ti&s;hne&s;s
of &s;ome particular &s;en&s;le&s;s Men, and the
Marks of a very particular E&s;teem and Re&s;pect,
which you have receiv'd upon all Occa&s;ions,
as well from the Queen, as from Per&s;ons em|ploy'd
in the highe&s;t Offices of the Govern|ment:
And that your Excellency will be &s;o
Ju&s;t, as to believe, that they would not have
failed to give you the mo&s;t ample Satisfaction,
long ago, if the Means of doing it were as rea|dy
at Hand, and Practicable, as the Queen's
inclination is forward to &s;atisfy his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty thereupon: Therefore I hope your Excel|lency,
will repre&s;ent the State of this Affair,
to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, after the mo&s;t favoura|ble
Manner, a&s;&s;uring him, that nothing has been
neglected by, and that nothing for the Future,
&s;hall be omitted, which tends to procure all the
Reparation the utmo&s;t rigour of the funda|mental
Laws of this Kingdom can afford. And
farther, if this be not found &s;ufficient, and any
thing can be &s;ugge&s;ted, that is in the Queen's
Power, whereby the may expre&s;s her high Di&s;|plea&s;ure
again&s;t tho&s;e who committed &s;o notorious
an in&s;ult, which may contribute to the
maintaining of Amity and good Corre&s;pondence
between her and his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, &s;he will
not fail on her Part, to be always ready to do
it; upon that Account, I lately propo&s;ed, by
the Queen's &s;pecial Order to the Parliament of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> that a Bill might be brought in,
<PB N="274" REF="283">
for e&s;tabli&s;hing, and &s;ecuring the Privileges of

dete&s;t the Violence that was offer'd to your
Excellency's Per&s;on and Character, but for as
much, as her Maje&s;ty, is de&s;irous of nothing
more, than to be in a Capacity of giving
Satisfaction in that Affair and &s;he is ab&s;o|lutely
di&s;po&s;ed to do all that lies in her
Power for that Purpo&s;e, we are per&s;waded,

and the ancient Alliancies, between the
two Crowns, that he will not in&s;i&s;t upon her
attempting Impo&s;&s;ibilities; and that he will
not undertake any thing, which may in any
wife be prejudicial to the good Corre&s;pondence
that has been hitherto maintain'd between
both their Maje&s;ty's, and which, as I hope
will continue for ever. I have the Satisfaction
to inform your Excellency, that the Queen
had no &s;ooner Notice, that two young <HI>Mu&s;|covite</HI>
princes, the Relations of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty,
were arrived in this Kingdom, but &s;he
forthwith gave Orders for their Reception
and Entertainment, with that particular Di|&s;tinction,
and Re&s;pect, which is due to their
high Birth. As for what Concerns my
&s;elf have, in executing the Queen's Orders
on this Emergency, I &s;hall di&s;charge my
Duty with a great deal of Delight: And I
can a&s;&s;ure your Excellency, at that time, that

<HEAD>To this Letter the Amba&s;&s;ador of Mu&s;covy
made An&s;wer to this Effect.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour to receive your Letter, dated
from White-hall, the 11th In&s;tant, O. S. and I
find therein many Declartions and Promi&s;es for the
future, as to what relates to the Reparation to the un|paralell'd
A&s;&s;ault made upon me by the Rabble, which
Promi&s;es are directed to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty my Ma|&s;ter,
on the part of the Queen of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> but
for the re&s;t, all that I can ob&s;erve mo&s;t con&s;iderable,
is the Propo&s;al you have tendered to the Parliament of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> by the Queen's In&s;tructions, in order
to get a Law enacted for the Security, and Mainte|nance
of the Sacred Privileges of Amba&s;&s;adors, and
other foreign Mini&s;ters, re&s;iding in her Maje&s;ty's Courts;
indeed this is a very proper Means to di&s;&s;ipate the Fears
which they were &s;eized with, &s;ince the In&s;ult that was
made, on a Mini&s;ter of the fir&s;t Rank, however, give me
<PB N="276" REF="285">
leave to tell you farther, that nothing carries le&s;s Ap|pearance
of the Satisfaction which his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje|&s;ty
requires, &s;ince the definitive Re&s;olution is &s;till want|ing
and is referr'd to the particular Laws of the
Country, &s;o that the Bu&s;ine&s;s is protracted by putting
it off from Time to Time, and from one Delay to a|nother:
If it were in the Queen's Power to con&s;ult the
Parliament about enacting of a new Law, touching the
immunity of foreign Mini&s;ters, and to prevent the Out|rages
which might be hereafter offer'd to them, could
not due Mea&s;ures have been taken at the &s;ame time,
for the Reparation of the pa&s;s'd Affront, which ac|cording
to your Letter is dete&s;ted by the, Queen, and
the whole <HI>Briti&s;h Nation:</HI> Certainly, it is a very ea|&s;y
Matter to do it, in Ca&s;e her Maje&s;ty has the lea&s;t
Inclination to bold an amicable Corre&s;pendence with
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, as his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty is di&s;|po&s;ed
to do with her, and to maintain the Law of
Nations in its Vigour, as the whole Univer&s;e does;
which ought to be the rather to be expected from the
Queen, &s;ince &s;he has formerly Contributed very much
to the Pre&s;ervation of the &s;ame, by firmly demand|ing
of the Republick of <HI>Venice,</HI> for an affront
offer'd to the Earl of Manche&s;ter her Amba&s;&s;ador,
altho' the In&s;ult was only made upon his Barks
and dome&s;tick Servants; &s;o that the S$nate, not|with&s;tanding
the mo&s;t ancient Laws of the Re|publick,
was prevailed upon to follow the Law of
Nations, by &s;atisfying the Amba&s;&s;ador, after the
manner he de&s;ir'd and demanded. Sir, You de&s;ire
by the &s;ame Letter, that I &s;hould acquaint his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty with the delay of your Courts of Judicature,
which binders this Affair; from being brought to an
I&s;&s;ue, altho' it might have been very conveniently ad|ju&s;ted
in the Space of &s;ix Months, &s;ince which Time
the Accident happen'd. But fora&s;much as your Let|ter
<PB N="277" REF="286">
contains nothing definitive, with Re&s;pect to the Sa|ti&s;faction.
I am extreamly concern'd, that it is not in
my Power to comply with your De&s;ires in that Particu|lar,
and I am &s;o much the more uncapable of doing it,
in regard that I have receiv'd his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's
po&s;itive Re&s;olution upon the Bu&s;ine&s;; as al&s;o, later
Orders, earne&s;tly to pre&s;s for the Qneen's An&s;wer
to my Ma&s;ter's Letter, and a Categorical Determi|nation,
whether the Law of Nation, with Re&s;pect
to foreign Powers, will be ob&s;erv'd or not? There|fore,
pur&s;uant to the &s;aid Orders, which I have
newly receiv'd, I would entreat you, Sir$ to honour
me with an An&s;wer to the above-mention'd Articles,
after you have &s;hewn the Contents to the Queen; to
the End that this Affair may be no longer de&s;err'd,
for the Delay occa&s;ion'd by your Laws, cannot give
any manner of &s;atisfaction to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty,
As to the Honours that have been lately done, by the
Queen's &s;pecial Command, to the two yomng Noble
Men, who are taken for <HI>Mu&s;covite Princes,</HI> related
to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, and are now at <HI>London;</HI>
I can a&s;&s;ure you, that his Maje&s;ty reckons none but the
Imperial Hereditary Prince within the Virge of his
augu&s;t Hou&s;e: They are two young Lords of illu&s;tru|ous
Birth, who have the Honour of being a Kin to
him, and are Travelling, <HI>incognito,</HI> to &s;ee the
World. But his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty does not de&s;ire that
they &s;hould be defray'd by any Power, they have
where withal to bear their own Charges, and if with|out
their Ma&s;ter's Orders, they think fit to accept of
Lodgings, or any thing el&s;e of that Nature, they are
to be accountable for t be &s;ame. It only remains, that
I return Thanks for the Kindne&s;s and Good Will you
profe&s;s to have for me, of the future Continuance of
which you are al&s;o pleas'd to a&s;&s;ure me; offering
you, my reciprocal Readine&s;s, to expre&s;s to you,

the &s;ame A&s;&s;urance, of the &s;incere Intention, and
particular Care taken for that Purpo&s;e. But, for
as much, as the Letters from <HI>England,</HI> of the 17th.
In&s;tant, <HI>O. S.</HI> do not expre&s;s, that from the 11th,
which was the Beginning of the <HI>Term,</HI> to the &s;aid

which ought to be pronounced again&s;t tho&s;e
Wret$bes, who a&s;&s;aulted me; nor even that the Af|fair

as the &s;incere friend&s;hip betwixt his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty

to put an End to tho&s;e Delays, and Means of demur|ing

not &s;eeing at this very In&s;tant, any apparent

give Satisfaction proportionable to the Outragiou&s;ne&s;s

you to &s;end me an an&s;wer in Writing, which I
impatiently expect, to the End that I may &s;end it to
the Court, conformable to my Orders. As to the no|tifying
the Act newly made, upon the Occa&s;ion of the
late A&s;&s;ault, upon my Per&s;on, for maintaining the
Privileges of Amba&s;&s;adors, of which Act Mr. <HI>d Ay|roll</HI>

I do my &s;elf the Honour to tell you, that it con|tributes
not, in any wi&s;e, to the Satisfaction now in

have been in all Ages, accounted inviolable among
the <HI>Chri&s;tan</HI> Powers, before that Declaration; which
being but a particular Law, can only &s;erve to ju&s;tify
the Honour of the Nation, and prevent for the Fu|ture,
all Inconveniencies which may happen to foreign
Mini&s;ters in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as well as to tho&s;e of
your Crown, in other Courts: 'Tis very much again&s;t
my will, that my Name is Celebrated in &s;uch a Man|ner
in your Con&s;titution, and that the Example is
tran&s;mitted to P$&s;terity; whereas, there being no|thing
Blame worthy in my Conduct, during my Re|i|dence

<P>&startq;THE fir&s;t Advice of that unfortunate Acci|dent,
was no &s;ooner brought to Court, but the
Guilty were made &s;en&s;ible of her Royal Indig|nation;
they were immediately arre&s;ted; they
were examin'd before the Queen, in her Coun|cil;
they were impri&s;on'd, and pro&s;ecuted with
the utmo&s;t Severity of our Laws: And tho'
the&s;e were found not to be exten&s;ive enough,
yet, they were declared infamous, by the Con|&s;ent
of the whole Nation, a&s;&s;embled in Parlia|ment,
who declar'd to the whole World, by a
publick Act, how much they abhor'd the Indig|nity
of the Fact, and took nece&s;&s;ary Precau|tions
to prevent the like In&s;olencies for the
Future. Neither did they &s;top there, for tho&s;e

any Favour or Protection, and excluded from
the General Pardon, which her Maje&s;ty, the

<P>WE have already written to your Imperial Maje&s;ty,

the unhappy Affront which was offer'd to your Am|ba&s;&s;adour
before he left our Court: We have &s;ince re|ceiv'd
the Letter which your Imperial Maje&s;ty wrote
to us, and we can a&s;&s;ure your Imperial Maje&s;ty, that
we were touch'd with true Sorrow, when we &s;aw how
highly you re&s;ented the Violence which had been offer'd
to your Imperial Maje&s;ty's own Per&s;on, in the Cha|racter
of your Amba&s;&s;ador, and we were the more
griev'd on this Occa&s;ion, when we reflected on the in&s;uf|ficiency
of our Laws, to give as ample a Satisfaction as
we de&s;ire to make, as well for the ju&s;t Sen&s;e, We our
Self had, of the Indignity which had been offer'd, as
to Convince your Imperial Maje&s;ty, how much we were
Inclin'd to make a &s;uitable Reparation, for the Inju|ry
done &s;o good a Friend and Ally; but we mu&s;t con|fe&s;s,
that at the &s;ame Time, we had a &s;ingular Plea&s;ure,
in ob&s;erving your Imperial Maje&s;ty's de&s;ire, to pre|vent
the Mi&s;under&s;tanding that might ari&s;e there|from;
and the great E&s;teem you &s;hew'd for our
Friend&s;hip; as well as the Care you Expre&s;s'd, to pre|&s;erve
and cultivate it by Reciprocal marks of Friend|&s;hip
and Affection.</P>
<P>Wherefore, we promi&s;e our &s;elf, from your Good|ne&s;s,
that upon the Repre&s;entations, which, from
Time to Time have been made to you, in our Name,
by our Envoy Extraordinary, at your Imperial Court,
your Imperial Maje&s;ty will be plea&s;ed, to examine in|to
the Nature of this Affair; where your Imperial
Maje&s;ty, will not &s;ee the lea&s;t Inclination, to favour
the Criminals, nor to &s;creen them from Justice.
But that there are in&s;uperable Difficulties, with Re|&s;pect
<PB N="294" REF="303">
to the ancient and fundamental Laws of the
Government of our People; which we fear, do not
permit &s;o &s;evere and rigorous a Sentence to be given,
as your Imperial Maje&s;ty, at fir&s;t, &s;eem'd to expect&punc;
in this Ca&s;e; and we per&s;wade our &s;elf, that your
Imperial Maje&s;ty, who are a Prince Equally famous
for Clemency, aud exact Ju&s;tice, will not require us,
who are the Gaurdian and Protectre&s;s of the Laws,
to inflict a Puni&s;hment upon our Subjects, which the
Laws do not impower us to do.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, we have not been wanting, at the
&s;ame Time, to u&s;e all the Means, which we judg'd
mo&s;t effectual, to per&s;wade your Maje&s;ty, and the
whole World, of the Sincerity of our Intentions, and
of our Endeavours in this Affair; and to the End
the guilty might be Puni&s;h'd, &s;o far, as the Laws and
Con&s;titutions of our Kingdoms, which were then in
Force, would permit; we gave expre&s;s, and re|peated
Orders to our Officers of Ju&s;tice, and to
our Mini&s;ters, to pro&s;ecute them with the uttermo&s;t
&s;everity.</P>
<P>That Pro&s;ecution has been long continu'd with ve|ry
great Diligence, and nothing has been omitted, to
bring it to as &s;peedy a Conclu&s;ion as po&s;&s;ible: But
after all&punc; the Matter is &s;uch, that we find our &s;elf
oblig'd, to inform your Imperial Maje&s;ty, that as
well, becau&s;e of the different Pleadings, in Favour
of the Criminals, the &s;low, but indi&s;per&s;able Manner
of proceeding in a Law Suit of &s;o great Importance;
as of the Ca&s;e it &s;elf, which is of an extraordinary
Nature, again&s;t which, no &s;ufficient Provi&s;ion is
made; in the ancient Statutes of the&s;e Kingdoms: It
has not been in the Power of our Council Learned in
the Law yet to obtain a Sentence, nor a final Deci&s;&s;ion
in this Affair.</P>

Wherefore, con&s;idering all the&s;e Inconveniencies,

in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Law, and de&s;iring,
at the &s;ame Time, to give you &s;ignal Marks of our

all the Acts and Proceedings which relate to the Ar|re&s;t
of the Per&s;on of your imperial Maje&s;ty's Amba&s;|&s;adour,
are annul'd, and raz'd out of the Regi&s;ters of
our Courts of Ju&s;tice; and tho&s;e who had a Share
therein,
are branded as infamous Criminals, and ob|noctious
to the Laws, which were then in Force; and
if any Per&s;on hereafter, dur&s;t commit the like Offence,
or any ways violate the Privileges of Amba&s;&s;adors
and other foreign Mini&s;ters, they will be lyable to
the mo&s;t &s;evere Penalties and Puni&s;hments, which the
arbitrary Power of the Judges, &s;hall think fit to inflict
upon them, and to which no bounds are given, in this
new Act; &s;o that all In&s;ults of this Nature, will be
prevented for the Future, and the Security, which
all Prince's Mini&s;ters ought to enjoy, will be firmly

the Future, will be indebted for this extraordinary
Act for their Protection, to the particular Con&s;idera|tion
which we, and our People have had for your Im|perial

<P>THUS ended this Affair, in which, &s;ome Peo|ple
thought the Queen &s;toop'd to low to the
<HI>Czar;</HI> as if the <HI>Czar</HI> had not been a Prince of
&s;uch Fame and Power, as merited &s;o much Con&s;i|deration;
but the Queen and her Council knew
better what Figure the <HI>Czar</HI> made in the World,
<PB N="301" REF="310">
and of what U&s;e the Commerce of <HI>Great Britain</HI>
to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Dominions was of; and be&s;ides this,
her Maje&s;ty very well knew, al&s;o, that Ju&s;tice
requir'd it, as &s;he would expect her Mini&s;ters
abroad &s;hould be well u&s;ed, by the Princes and
Powers, her Neighbours; and as &s;he expected o|ther
Princes and Nations &s;hould act by her, if
her Mini&s;ters receiv'd any Affront from the Rables
and Clamours of the People.</P>
<P>WE are now to return to the Affair of the
<HI>Turks,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> was really, very loath to fall out
with the <HI>Turks.</HI> But, as he found his Enemy,
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and the Palatine of <HI>Kiow,</HI>
had the A&s;cendant there, and would kindle a
Flame whether he would or no, he made the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
Preparations for his own Defence.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, heat the &s;ame time wrote Letters,

po&s;&s;ible, to prevent a Rupture, and publi&s;h'd
&s;everal Declarations, offering to refer any Differ|ences
that might happen between the Grand
Seignior and him&s;elf, to the Arbitration of other
Princes; and the <HI>Turks</HI> at the &s;ame Time, &s;end|ing
an Aga, as a Mini&s;ter to <HI>Vienna,</HI> to prevent the
Emperor taking Umbrage at his Breach with the
<HI>Czar,</HI> His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty tran&s;mitted one of his
Declarations to <HI>Vienna,</HI> that it might be commu|nicated
to the &s;aid <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter, upon his Ar|rival
there; this Declaration &s;hewing a Readi|ne&s;s
in the <HI>Czar,</HI> to pre&s;erve the Publick Peace;
is of very great Con&s;equence in this Ca&s;e, to
clear the Character of the <HI>Czar,</HI> from the Scan|dal
of Breach of Treaty, which was pretended
to be charg'd upon him, the <HI>Turks</HI> being manife&s;t|ly
the Aggre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="311">
WHEREAS, we have receiv'd certain Informa|tion,
from divers Places, that the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port
endeavours to ju&s;tify the Violation of Peace, by a War;
already declared again&s;t us, and actually begun, by
the Irruption of the <HI>Tartars</HI> into our Territories:
And for that Purpo&s;e, charge us with &s;everal ground|less
Matters, by which, they pretend they were forc'd
to come to a Rup$ure; and among&s;t others, as if we
were not inclin'd to continue in Peace with them, but
had actually re&s;olved to begin a War: As al&s;o, that
contrary to the Peace concluded with the <HI>Otto|man's</HI>
we had erected&s; &s;everal new Fortifications, on
our Frontiers; &s;uffer'd our Troops to Enter the
<HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions; and that we would not give
them Leave to Convoy the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> in
Safety, back to his own Territories. We have
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to declare here openly, that
we never had the leaft Intention, to break in any
Manner what&s;oever, the Peace concluded between us
and the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, and to enter into a War
with the <HI>Turks;</HI> but the &s;ame has been hitherto,
religiou&s;ly, and inviolably ob&s;erved by us; the For|tifications
erected by us, are likewi&s;e, in no Re&s;pect,
again&s;t the Treaty, but upon our own Territories;
which partly belong'd to us of Old, and partly was
yielded to us by the Treaty, and the Limits marked
out by the Commi&s;&s;aries on both Sides, which have
been fixed many Years ago: And it is therefore to be
wonder'd, that the <HI>Port</HI> would take Occa&s;ion to com|plain
thereof, at this Juncture; our Troops never
enter'd on the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Dominions, but remain'd only
upon the Frontiers; and altho', they did &s;ome Time
ago&punc; according to the Laws of War, pur&s;ue their Enemy
into the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Territories, and &s;eized them there|in;
which, however, was done in &s;uch Places, where
<PB N="303" REF="312">
there were, no Inhabitants; yet all this as well as
other Matters, were fully &s;etled and adju&s;ted, in the
Confirmation of Peace, renew'd la&s;t Year; whereby
the <HI>Port</HI> did likewi&s;e &s;tipulate with our Amba&s;&s;a|dor,
that they &s;hould Convoy the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
with 500 <HI>Turks,</HI> thro' <HI>Poland,</HI> and that we &s;hould
Guard him by our Officers from the Frontiers; to
which, we not only con&s;ented, but al&s;o, promi&s;ed to
procure the like Con&s;ent, from the King and Repub|lick
of <HI>Poland:</HI> But this being not accepted by the
<HI>Port,</HI> on the Account of &s;everal Pretences, we did
at la&s;t, in two of our Letters to the Sultan, and
by our Amba&s;&s;ador, and Privy-Councellor <HI>Tol&s;hoy,</HI>
at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> declare that we would &s;uffer
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to pa&s;s through <HI>Poland</HI> free,
and unmole&s;ted, into his own Dominions; and to
that End, permit him a Guard of 5000 <HI>Turks,</HI>
to &s;end him &s;afe thro' <HI>Poland;</HI> whereby our peace|able
Temper &s;ufficiently appears, and that on our
Part, we have contributed all, what might pre|vent
all manner of Di&s;turbance, and maintain
a good Corre&s;pondence, and Neighbourly Friend|&s;hip
with the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, and that all the
World may be &s;en&s;ible thereof, we confirm here,
with our former Declaration an Offer, before a
tedious War be commenc'd, to accommodate Matters
with the <HI>Port,</HI> and to live in a neighbourly Amity
with her, as formerly: And notwith&s;tanding, in
order to provide for our Precaution and Security;
(after we have been informed from all Parts, of a
Rupture, and that the War is actually declared
again&s;t us at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and our Amba&s;&s;a|dor
carried Pri&s;oner to the <HI>Seven Towers</HI>), we
have cau&s;ed our Troops to march to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>
Frontiers: They &s;hall, however, not undertake any
Ho&s;tilities, provided the <HI>Turks</HI> live on their Part,
<PB N="304" REF="313">
peaceably; put a Stop to all Preparations of War,

a&s;&s;ured of the&s;e Things, by the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port;
Order our Forces to with draw from the Frontiers,
and facilitate as much as in us lies, a friendly Ac|commodation:
So we willingly accept, and herewith
de&s;ire the Mediation of his Imperial Maje&s;ty, her
Maje&s;ty the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and their High

per&s;i&s;t in her Re&s;olution to break the Peace with us,
and begin the War again&s;t us; we declare before God,

guilty of all the Blood that may be &s;pilt on this Oc|ca&s;ion;
and we have an entire Confidence in God,
that he will a&s;&s;i&s;t our ju&s;t Cau&s;e, and pro&s;per our
Arms with Victory, again&s;t an Enemy who breaks
Treaties; and who but a Year ago, by &s;o many Oaths

<P><PB N="305" REF="314">
&startq;TIMES have produced Revolutions, Peace

has been to&s;s'd with &s;trange Vici&s;&s;itudes: But
the pre&s;ent Profidiou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Ottomans,</HI>

<P>&startq;NO doubt, but the Common Report of this,

manife&s;tly Known to all, how <HI>Achmet,</HI> the
now Reigning Sultan of the <HI>Turks,</HI> has impi|ou&s;ly,
frivolou&s;ly, and without the lea&s;t, ju&s;t
Occa&s;ion, violated, and broken the 30 Years
Peace, concluded between his &s;acred <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty,
and his Predece&s;&s;or, Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI>
tho' renew'd by him&s;elf, this very la&s;t Year,
1710, and ratify'd by a &s;olemn Oath, in the
Pre&s;ence of the mo&s;t high God of Heaven;
which he afterwards confirm'd, as well in his
Letters which he writ to his &s;aid <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje|&s;ty,
as in the Deed of publick Renovation;
and yet, in the Month of <HI>November,</HI> the very
&s;ame Year, e're the Sun had compleated its

mo&s;t ignominious Manner, and &s;eized upon

<P>&startq;IT is true, he has not herein degenerated

that mo&s;t excellent Patriarch of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>

their very Beginnings, made it their chief
Study, to watch Quarrels and Di&s;agreements,
that at any Time happen'd between any <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI>
Princes, and States; and that as often as
they found Occa&s;ion, they never &s;tuck at any
Stipulations of Peace, or &s;olemn Oaths; and
that thus, the Offspring of Thieves and Rob|bers,
did in a few Years, &s;ubdue to their own
Dominions, &s;o many ancient and renowned
<HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Kingdoms and Provinces, together
with a great many holy and venerable Places;
and at la&s;t became the mo&s;t powerful, and

finding that the noble Firmne&s;s of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI>

of the War requir'd their keeping it for that
Time: So, that after a prodigious Lo&s;s of Men,
he was forc'd to retire to his own Teritories,

<P>&startq;HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty gave Con&s;ent to this

far from putting the Articles thereof in Execu|tion,

were incorporated with his Empire, and expre&s;|ly
adjudg'd to belong to it, as well by the

Troops breaking into their Territories, in pur|&s;uit
of the fugative <HI>Swedes,</HI> where they killed

this according to the Manner and Cu&s;tom of

<P>&startq;BUT as far as we dive into the true De&s;ign

on the War again&s;t his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, in
conjunction with their Confederates, and by
the perfidious Means of the <HI>Mazeppian</HI> Rebels,

tho&s;e mo&s;t pernicious and abominable

<P>&startq;THAT therefore, the Ju&s;tice of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>

&s;ince this fir&s;t Minute of the Truce of <HI>Carlo|witz,</HI>
and the Conclu&s;ion of the 30 Years Peace,
which the Sultan of the <HI>Turks</HI> has now ba&s;ely
broke to this very Hour, gave him any Occati|on
for &s;uch a Breach, but did holily and reli|giou&s;ly
ob&s;erve the &s;ame, notwith&s;tanding
the great and many Attempts made to the Con|trary,
on the Part of the <HI>Turks,</HI> what by ho|&s;tile

Steps he made in the whole Series of this Af|fair,
and judge whether there was the lea&s;t Oc|cation
given on his Maje&s;ty's Side, for break|ing
<PB N="320" REF="329">
of the Peace, and whether after the previ|ous
Marks which he gave of his good Intentions,
he could ab&s;tain from declaring War in his
Turn, again&s;t the profidious and perpetual
Enemy of <HI>Chri&s;tanity:</HI> And finally, let him
conclude, that this particular War was forced
upon his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty contrary to the Faith
of Treaties, and the Sacred Tye of publick
Oaths; who thereupon with God Almighty's
A&s;&s;i&s;tance, has re&s;olv'd in his own Defence, to
order his Army, to March to his Frontiers
again&s;t his perfidious Enemy, the Sultan of the
<HI>Turks,</HI> and all his Confederates and Abettors:

<P>&startq;AT the &s;ame time the <HI>Czar</HI> wrote a Letter to

with a &s;ufficient Guard for the Safety of his

your Territories, and return into his own; offering
him a free Pa&s;&s;age through our Armies, under a
a Guard of 4000 <HI>Tartars,</HI> and 5000 <HI>Turks,</HI> in ca&s;e
your Highne&s;s &s;hould think it proper, for his greater

to propo&s;e to you; and his <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty having
likewi&s;e con&s;ented to it, we were bound to an&s;wer for
the &s;aid free Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Moreover, We declared, that in ca&s;e your High|ne&s;s

<P>We are not the violators of that Peace, but would

offer to return into his Dominions by any other
Way than has been propo&s;ed to him under Colour of
greater Security, we &s;hall look upon that Proceeding
as an open Violation of the Peace.</P>
<P>We have not yet received any An&s;wer from your
Highne&s;s, to our former Letters, nor from our Am|ba&s;&s;dor,

the <HI>Tartars</HI> who are ready to conduct the King of

to your Highne&s;s, to exhort you once more to an&s;wer
our former Letters, and to let us know whether you
intend to ob&s;erve the Treaty prolong'd with us la&s;t

made before the Judge of all our Actions, or to vio|late

<P>We al&s;o declare, that in ca&s;e we receive no An&s;wer

that your Highne&s;s continues your Military Prepa|rations,
to conduct the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> through <HI>Po|land,</HI>
with a powerful Army, we &s;hall look, upon this
as an open Violation of the Truce; and calling God
to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;hall provide for our own Safety,
and endeavour to repul&s;e our Enemies with the Ar|my
we have &s;ent upon the Frontier.</P>
<P>In the mean while, if the Rupture of the Peace
be attended with the Effu&s;ion of Human Blood, we
declare, before God and Man, that it will not be
our Fault, but that we &s;hall be forc'd to it. We like|wise
take God to Witne&s;s that it was never our In|tention
to break the Truce, but to ob&s;erve it religi|ou&s;ly
as we promi&s;ed, wherefore, without Tru&s;ting
in any vain Immagination, but only in the &s;upreme
Judge, we hope, he will defend us again&s;t all Di|&s;turberso$
the Peace and Violators of Cat$s.</P>

We expect therefore, an An&s;wer to the&s;e Pre|&s;ents

it, as a Breach of the Peace: But if we
&s;ee by your Highne&s;&s;es An&s;wer, that your Inten|tion

the Peace with us, (the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> be|ing

all our Umbrage will Cea&s;e.</P>

be given us, our Troops &s;hall forthwith with|draw

<P>ALL these Things put together, will convince
any indifferent Per&s;on, that the <HI>Czar</HI> was no
ways acce&s;&s;ary to this War; but that on the Con|trary,
his Maje&s;ty u&s;ed all ju&s;t Means con&s;i&s;tent
with his Honour, to keep the Peace, &s;o newly
entred into, and &s;o &s;olemnly &s;worn between him|&s;elf
and the <HI>Turks.</HI> But it could not be, the
<HI>Turks</HI> prepair'd for War, with all imaginable
Diligence; the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> began to grow
formidable again at <HI>Bender,</HI> having gotten near
20000 Men together, very good Troops, mo&s;t of
them <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Poles,</HI> and now the Grand Army
<PB N="324" REF="333">
of the <HI>Turks</HI> which had encamped at <HI>Adrinople</HI>
&s;ome Time, began to advance.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> had a good Army of excellent
Troops, and he had order'd the Hor&s;e for &s;ome
Time to rendezvous about <HI>Lemberg,</HI> where his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty came &s;oon after in Per&s;on, and
advanc'd with them to the Frontiers; they con|&s;i&s;ted
in about 40000 Hor&s;e, and a great Body of
the Hor&s;e remain'd about <HI>Ja&s;&s;y,</HI> to &s;ecure the
Communication.</P>
<P>WITH this Army, when joyn'd by the Infant|ry,
the <HI>Czar</HI> advanced; and having an intimate
Corre&s;pondence with the Ho&s;podar of <HI>Moldavia,</HI>
he made Conditions with him, to furni&s;h his,
Army with Bread, and other Provi&s;ions, and
to give him Pa&s;&s;age and Re-pa&s;&s;age thro' the
Country.</P>
<P>SOME have &s;aid the Ho&s;podar kept a &s;ecret
Corre&s;pondence with the Grand Vizier, all the
while; and did this on purpo&s;e to betray the
<HI>Czar,</HI> but this was grounded on a Mi&s;take; the
Ho&s;podar perform'd his Agreement as long as he
was able to do it without ruining him&s;elf, and
all his Affairs; but drew off, when he &s;aw the
<HI>$urki&s;h</HI> Army was &s;o much &s;uperior to the <HI>Czar,</HI>
that he apprehended a Blow, and that he &s;hould
fall into the Hands of the <HI>Turks;</HI> then indeed,
it was to be expected he would act with more
Caution.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, 'tis &s;aid, the Ho&s;poder
did perform his Part effectually, as to furni&s;hing
what Provi&s;ions the <HI>Czar</HI> requir'd, and that no|thing
was deficient, but that the Ho&s;podar never
condition'd to furni&s;h Troops, or to draw his
Sword in the Quarrel.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="334">
BUT to let that pa&s;s, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;et
out from <HI>Jaro&s;law,</HI> the 10th of <HI>June,</HI> 1710,
where Matters were concerted between the King
of <HI>Poland</HI> and him&s;elf, for mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance
in this War, after which the King of <HI>Poland</HI>
went away into <HI>Saxony,</HI> to &s;ettle his Affairs
in <HI>Germany;</HI> and the <HI>Czar</HI> went from thence
to <HI>Lemberg,</HI> as above, then the Army; that is to
&s;ay, the Cavalry, were order'd to advance to the
<HI>Dnei&s;ter;</HI> His Maje&s;ty joyn'd them near <HI>Kami|nieck</HI>
and march'd, keeping the River on his
Right, till he came to <HI>Ra&s;kow,</HI> on the <HI>Dnei&s;ter,</HI>
where he was joyn'd by the four Regiments of
his Guards, or Hou&s;hold Troops; the re&s;t of the
Infantry coming up in a few Days more, by the
Way of <HI>Bracklaw</HI> and <HI>Czarka&s;&s;y;</HI> &s;ome pa&s;&s;ing
by <HI>Kiovia,</HI> and &s;ome by <HI>Pultowa,</HI> a Place made
famous by the late Overthrow of the King of
<HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the whole Army was brought toge|her,
they reckon'd them to be 35000 Foot, and
40000 Hor&s;e, all choice Troops, e&s;pecially
the Infantry; 3000 <HI>Turks</HI> po&s;ted overagain&s;t <HI>Ra&s;kow,</HI>
in order to di&s;pute their Pa&s;&s;age Over the <HI>Neither,</HI>
abandon'd their po&s;t upon the coming up of 2000
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Grenadiers, who had pa&s;s'd in the
Night in &s;ome &s;mall Boats, at about a League di|&s;tance,
and out of their Sight.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the <HI>Turks</HI> were fled, two Bridges
being laid upon the River, and a &s;mall En|trenchment
at the End of each Bridge, to &s;e|cure
the Pa&s;&s;age, the whole Army pa&s;&s;ed over
with their Artillery and Baggage.</P>
<P>FROM the <HI>Nei&s;ter,</HI> the Army advanced to
the <HI>Pruth,</HI> and the <HI>Czar</HI> went in Per&s;on with
5000 Dragoons to <HI>Ja&s;&s;y,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Moldavia;</HI>
<PB N="326" REF="335">
to Conver&s;e with the Ho&s;podar, and to &s;ecure
&s;ufficient Magaziens of <HI>Provi&s;ions</HI> which that Coun|try
and <HI>Wallachia,</HI> being very fruitful, were very
well able to Furni&s;h: Here the <HI>Czar</HI> &s;taying too
long, gave the <HI>Turks,</HI> who where then as far off
as the <HI>Danube,</HI> Time to come up, for the Vizier
hearing that the <HI>Czar</HI> was pa&s;t the Nei&s;ter, made
long Marches, fearing the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> &s;hould reach
to the Banks of the <HI>Danube</HI> before him, and con|&s;equently
&s;hould prevent or di&s;pute his Pa&s;&s;age,
and perhaps have given him a Blow, if he had
attempted it.</P>
<P>The Vizier was decamp'd from <HI>Adrianople</HI> ac|cording
to the be&s;t Advices, when the <HI>Czar</HI> came
to the Banks of the <HI>Nei&s;ter;</HI> but had &s;ent a great
Body of his Infantry that they might pa&s;s the
Straights of the Mountain <HI>Hemus,</HI> which runs
in a Chain, from the Shore of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Gulph,
thro' <HI>Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Thrace,</HI> to the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea;
but as &s;oon as the Vizier had an Account, that
the <HI>Czar</HI> had advanc'd, he put him&s;elf in full
March with the Hor&s;e, and came to the <HI>Danube,</HI>
the 24th of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>HAD not his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty been delay'd at
<HI>Ja&s;&s;y</HI> too long, but had pa&s;s'd the <HI>Pruth</HI> at that
City, and march'd on directly to the <HI>Danube,</HI> he
had certainly carry'd the Point, and the Vizier
had been kept at Bay, at the pa&s;&s;ing that River;
for he would not have ventur'd to have pa&s;s'd
the <HI>Danube,</HI> which is a prodigious great River at
<HI>Sili&s;iria, a little above which he went over,</HI> and the
Stream fierce and Rapid: I <HI>&s;ay,</HI> he would not
have ventur'd to pa&s;s that River, in the Teeth
of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army; or if he had, he would
have run a great Ri&s;que of being defeated.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="336">
IT was without doubt, either a Mi&s;take, or a
Misfortune, that his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Army
&s;hould Halt upon the <HI>Pruth,</HI> and let the <HI>Turks</HI>
pa&s;s the <HI>Danube;</HI> and his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;aw it,
when it was too late; for had the Banks of the
<HI>Danube</HI> been &s;ecured, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> mu&s;t
have &s;hifted his Quarters, and have quitted
<HI>Bender,</HI> with as much Precipitation, almo&s;t, as
he did <HI>Pultowa,</HI> and perhaps would have found
it more difficult to have made his E&s;cape.</P>
<P>NOR would the Forces of the <HI>Tartars</HI> have
been &s;o trouble&s;ome, if the Grand Army of the
<HI>Turks</HI> had been kept off; for tho' they call'd
the <HI>Tartars</HI> 50000 yet the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> would have
fac'd about, and have made them &s;hift off, as
fa&s;t as they came: But when the <HI>Turks</HI> lay at
the <HI>Danube</HI> before, and the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> had their
Hands full of them in their Front, it was ea&s;y
for a Body of <HI>Tartars</HI> to do Mi&s;chief in the
Rear.</P>
<P>'TIS to no Purpo&s;e to enlarge upon what
might have been done, it is our Part to give
the Hi&s;tory of what was really done; and the
<HI>Czar</HI> having lo&s;t 12 Days Time at <HI>Ja&s;&s;y,</HI> the
Banks of the <HI>Pruth,</HI> the Grand Army of the
<HI>Turks</HI> Pa&s;s'd the <HI>Danube</HI> undi&s;turb'd, and advanc'd.
a-pace.</P>
<P>WHILE the <HI>Turks</HI> and the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> were then
facing one another, the <HI>Tartars</HI> by their Inroads
Harra&s;s'd the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army, took many Hor&s;es,
and killed a great many People, and at la&s;t,
effectually cut off their Provi&s;&s;ions, &s;unk or
burnt all the Boats they had on the <HI>Purth,</HI> and
in a Word, being very numerous, they did the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> a World of Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="337">
THIS brought them to a Battle, for the <HI>Turks</HI>

<P>THE Sum of the Story, is this; the <HI>Turks</HI> ad|vancing,
and appearing very numerous, the <HI>Czar</HI>
cau&s;ed his Men to entrench, believing the Ene|my
would attack them; as, indeed, they did
the next Day; the Entrenchment which they
attack'd, was Guarded by 12 Battallions of <HI>Mu&s;|covite</HI>
Infantry, and about 3000 Granediers;
who all together ply'd their Time &s;o well, and

which la$ted four Hours, the Ba&s;ha's bringing
on fre&s;h Men, as the others were beaten off,
were finally repul&s;ed with great Slaughter; a
Body of Dragoons, who were po&s;ted to Support
the Defendants, falling out al&s;o upon them in
their Retreat.</P>
<P>THAT Night the Intrenchments were en|larg'd,
and 10000 Foot, &s;upported by Dragoons,
were po&s;ted to defend them; the Enemy came
on again to the A&s;&s;ault, with 20000 <HI>Janizaries,</HI>
&s;upported by a great Body of Hor&s;e; the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI>
Army &s;tood in Order of Battle in two Lines, in
their Camp, which was al&s;o entrench'd; the Fight
was ob&s;tinate, and very bloody; the Fury of the

<P><PB N="329" REF="338">
HOWEVER, as the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;till prepar'd to re|new
their Efforts, as if re&s;olv'd to carry the
Entrenchments, whatever it Co&s;t; and his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty finding the <HI>Tartars</HI> which harraz'd him,
continually in the Rear, had 10000 Foot &s;ent
them from the Viziers Army, and that he &s;hould
be in Danger of being quite Surrounded by two

was wor&s;e, that his Convoys were cut off by the
<HI>Tartars;</HI> he re&s;olv'd to Retreat; which, however,
was done in &s;uch Order, and with &s;uch daring
Boldne&s;s of Courage, in Sight of the Enemy,
that when the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Cavalry, pretended to pur|&s;ue
them, the Foot fairly faced about, threw
down their <HI>Chevauz de Frieze,</HI> and pour'd in
their Volleys upon the <HI>Turks,</HI> and then Re|treated.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, this retreating fareagu'd the Army
to the la&s;t Degree, and the <HI>Tartars</HI> &s;urprizing
a great many of the <HI>Czar's</HI> Hor&s;es, added to the
Misfortune, &s;everal Regiments of Hor&s;e be|ing
entirely di&s;mounted: So the <HI>Czar</HI> finding a
convenient Situation to Encamp and Entrench,
halted again.</P>
<P>HERE the Vizier came up with the whole
<HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Army, but dur&s;t not attack the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI>
Camp, the Front being defended by a Mora&s;s;
the Right Wing, by a winding Branch of the Ri|ver
<HI>Pruth;</HI> and the Left, by a Hill, which the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Infantry, had entrenched: The Vizier
&s;eeing this, brings up his Cannon, and Can|nonaded
them in their Camp, with 50 Pieces of
heavy Artillery; and their Camp lying expo&s;ed
to this Battery, there was no hindring it; at the
&s;ame Time, they &s;eem'd entirely to be &s;hut in,
by the winding of the River <HI>Pruth,</HI> and the E|nemy;
<PB N="330" REF="339">
&s;o that in &s;hort, the Generals began to
look one upon another, as Men de&s;perate, and
at a Lo&s;s what to do.</P>
<P>THE Colonels, and inferiour Officers, were
for drawing out the Array, and giving the <HI>Turks</HI>
Battle, and the Common Soldiers cry'd out to
be led again&s;t the Enemy, that they might dye
with their Swords in their Hands, and &s;ell their
Lives as dear as they could, rather than be torn
in Pieces with the Cannon, and peri&s;h in the
Camp for Want of Provi&s;ions: But his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty, who alone was not di&s;maid at the Cir|cum&s;tances
he was in, quikly re&s;olv'd what to
do, and order'd a Trumpet with three Officers,
to the Vizier, writing a Letter to the Vizier
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE Effect of this Me&s;&s;age, <HI>what ever the Pro|po&s;al

de&s;ir'd, that it produc'd a Treaty; and tho'
it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that the Circum&s;tances of
the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army then were &s;uch that a De|feat
was inevitable, except by a de&s;perate Brave|ry
they could have broke thro' the whole <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>
Army, which being &s;o de&s;titute of Hor&s;es, was
next to impo&s;&s;ible; yet, as they were all re|&s;olv'd
to dye with their Emperor, and to &s;ell
their Lives like Men of Honour; the Vizier, who
knew it, mu&s;t have cau&s;ed a mo&s;t bloody Action,
and perhaps might have been ruinous to him al&s;o,
thought fit to con&s;ider what Propo&s;als were made
and whether the Demands he might make, might
not only &s;ave the pre&s;ent Effu&s;ion of Blood, but
a future Expence both of Blood and Trea&s;ure

UPON this Foot, he Demanded the City of

<P>THE bringing &s;uch a Treaty to Conclu&s;ion,
in &s;uch an Exigency, was a Ma&s;ter-Piece of
the <HI>Czar</HI>'s own conducting; for on the other
Hand, the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> did his utmo&s;t to pre|vent
it, nay, even he reproach'd the Vizier in
the Head of has Army, complaining that he
&s;hould give up the Grand Seignior Enemy, when
he was in his Hand, and that in one Day the
<HI>Czar</HI> mu&s;t be his Pri&s;oner, and all his Army;

propo&s;ed, particularly the re&s;toring of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> a

his Ma&s;ter, the Grand Seignior's Intere&s;t; and
that he had taken a great Sum of Money to let
the <HI>Czar</HI> e&s;cape out of his Hands, when he might
with Ea&s;e have carry'd him away in Triumph,
and have deliver'd him up, at the Gate of the

<P>THIS they aggravated to that Degree after|wards,
and told their Tale &s;o &s;peciou&s;ly, that the
Grand Seignior was quite turn'd about in his
Judgment of the Thing, and re&s;ented it to the
Ruin of the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> who was &s;trangled
&s;oon after, by Order of his Ma&s;ter, for making
the Treaty, which he him&s;elf had approv'd.</P>
<P>BY this Treaty, (the Peace being made) the
<HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and his whole Army, march'd
&s;afe and quietly, to the Bank of the <HI>Dnei&s;ter,</HI>
and &s;o by ea&s;y Marches, into the <HI>Ukraine,</HI> with
all their Cannon and Baggage; and thus ended
this &s;hort War, wherein tho' the <HI>Czar</HI> indeed
lo&s;t the Honour of the Field, yet he gain'd this
great Point; namely, that the <HI>Turks</HI> abandon'd
the Intere&s;t of the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> which was
all i. deed, that the War was made for; and
which if they would have done before, the <HI>Czar</HI>
would never have took the Field at all: The
Lo&s;s the <HI>Czar</HI> &s;u&s;tain'd in this Battle, was not
much le&s;s than 10000 Men, and a prodigious
Number of Hor&s;es, &s;ome &s;aid 30000, but no
Artillery, or Trophies.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty having thus gotten over the main Article, the War with the <HI>Turks;</HI> little

been concerted and agreed to, by the <HI>Allies</HI> on both
&s;ides; expecting and confiding, that the King of <HI>Swe|den</HI>
would agree, and conform him&s;elf to that Con|vention,
according to the obligatory Declaration of
the Royal <HI>Senate</HI> of <HI>Stockholm,</HI> delivered in a
&s;olemn manner in Writing at the <HI>Hague;</HI> but con|trary
to the Opinion and Expectation of all, the King

the mo&s;t Serene <HI>Allies</HI> in &s;everal ways, and &s;et
on Foot a Treaty with them for putting into their Ser|vice
8000 Men, to be detach'd from the Troops un|der

was look'd upon as concluded, $e forbid the Senate
of <HI>Stockholm</HI> to part with any Forces for the Ser|vice

<P><HI>I.</HI> Not contented therewith, he augmented his
Army in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> above one half of the

the Provinces included in the Neutrality, to be
cha&s;ed by his Men of War, and u&s;ed in a $word$
manner, breaking thereby the Neutrallity afore|&s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>IV.</HI> After having concluded an Alliance with the
<HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, the Hereditary Enemy of the

at the Diet of <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> by a &s;olemn Writing
dated from <HI>Bender,</HI> the 30th of <HI>November,</HI>
1710; that he rejected the Neutrallity afore&s;aid,
and would not be oblig'd to the &s;ame; and the
Baron <HI>de Stralenheim,</HI> his Envoy at the Impa|rial

<PB N="341" REF="350">
a har&s;h Stile, attended with Mennaces, hard|ly
to be endur'd, as that the Convention for the
&s;aid Neutrality was partial (tho' it was for his
Advantage, if he would con&s;ider the Thing
Right:) that $e re&s;erv'd to him&s;elf an unlimit|ed
Liberty, to employ his Forces again&s;t whom&s;oever,

&s;hould think fit, according to the Laws and

again&s;t the Confederated Princes in the <HI>North</HI>
in general, and again&s;t the mo&s;t Serene King of

he will attack him in the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Dominions, and
in his Electorate, or, where&s;oever he &s;hould
think fit; but may be look'd upon al&s;o, as a De|claration
of War again&s;t the <HI>Allies,</HI> now in War
again&s;t <HI>France;</HI> and an intimation that he will
carry on the &s;ame on all Sides, by the help of
his Confederates the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars:</HI> This
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> has expre&s;s'd in plain
Terms, in his Manife&s;to dated from <HI>Bender,</HI>
28th of <HI>January,</HI> of this pre&s;ent Year 1711.
which the Palatine of <HI>Kiow</HI> di&s;per&s;ed in <HI>Po|land,</HI>
attended with an Army of <HI>Barbarians</HI>
and <HI>Infidels,</HI> and which was directly intended
again&s;t the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> wherein he declar'd
be has made an Alliance with the <HI>Turks</HI> and
<HI>Tartars,</HI> for that Purpo&s;e; But the&s;e Threats
will not binder the mo&s;t Serene <HI>Allies;</HI> again&s;t
<HI>France,</HI> from adbearing to the Mea&s;ures con|certed,
for maintaining the Neutrality, afore|&s;aid.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="351">
<HI>V.</HI> To what has been already &s;aid, it mu&s;t, be ad|ded,
that the Rebel <HI>Smigielski,</HI> was lately &s;ent
from the <HI>Swedi&s;h Pomerania</HI> with a Manife&s;to
of Count <HI>Lezinski</HI> (who not only continues in
the Country, but is maintain'd therein) and with
&s;ome Troops has made an Irruption into the
Country to exhort the <HI>Poles</HI> to Rebellion, and
has actually committed Ho&s;tilities again&s;t the
Troops of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and when they
were Pur&s;uing him, he retired again into the
<HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Province afore&s;aid, where he is en|tertain'd,
and &s;upply'd with Nece&s;&s;aries, by
which Action, this Neutrality has been again
infringed by the <HI>Swedes:</HI> Therefore the mo&s;t
Serene King of <HI>Poland,</HI> is not only grounded in
Justice, But be&s;ides, lies under a pre&s;&s;ing Nece&s;&s;ity,
to make u&s;e of all lawful Means, for eradica|ting
this Evil, and preventing tho&s;e Dangers in
their very Source.</P>
<P>There is no Rea&s;on to believe, that when the mo&s;t
Serene <HI>Allies</HI> again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> induced the mo&s;t Serene
King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and his Allies, to accept, out of
Regard to them, a Neutrality &s;o advantagious to the
King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> tho' he had rejected it with Scorn,
ever pretend that this Compliance and Readine&s;s of
his <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, &s;hould turn to the Ruin of the
Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> and other Provinces belonging to
him; tho' this has, in a great Mea&s;ure, already hap|pen'd;
&s;eeing that out of Fear of an Inva&s;ion on the
Part of the &s;aid <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Forces in <HI>Pomerania</HI>
Many Subjects of his Majesty have abandon'd their
Country, whereby the Credit of the Merchants among&s;t
Forreigners, and trade in general, has receiv'd great
Prejudice: be&s;ides this Damage; the Expences for
rai&s;ing new Forces, and equiping them, their
<PB N="343" REF="352">
Marches, and Maintenance, with the rai&s;ing of the
Militia throughout the whole Electorate of <HI>Saxony,</HI>
have not only put the mo&s;t Serene King of <HI>Poland</HI> to
great Charges, and involv'd him in great Difficulties,
but have al&s;o le&s;&s;en'd very much his Revenues, and
occa&s;ion'd many other Lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Furthermore, it would be altogether unrea&s;onable,
that the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who has already receiv'd
this Benefit of the Convention of the Neutrality tho'
irreverently rejected by him, in that no Body has pur&s;u'd
the Forces of <HI>Cra&s;&s;au</HI> into <HI>Pomerania,</HI> &s;hould conti|nue
to enjoy the &s;aid Neutrality, to the Prejudice of
the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and his Allies, in the <HI>North;</HI>
for no Body can be in&s;ensible that the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> War
is founded on the Augmentation of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army
in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and the future Inva&s;ion by the &s;ame,
of <HI>Poland</HI> or <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>The State of Affairs being &s;uch, and the World
being per&s;waded that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> has &s;o ex|plain'd
his Mind by Words and Deeds, that nothing
further is to be expected from him; and that on the
other Hand, it appears, after other violent Means of
that King, which were &s;carce ever heard of before, from
a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Prince; That the Security of the mo&s;t
Serene King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and his Dominions depends
on the Di&s;per&s;ion of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army in <HI>Pomera|nia;</HI>
it follows that the mo&s;t Serene <HI>Allies</HI> again&s;t
<HI>France,</HI> are oblig'd to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with their Forces,
according to the Tenor of the Convention, and as the
Pre&s;ervation and Tranquility of the Holy <HI>Roman</HI>
Empire, and the happy Succe&s;s of the Common Cau&s;e
depend, in a great Mea&s;ure on this Point; the mo&s;t
Serene King of <HI>Poland</HI> expected that the mo&s;t Serene
<HI>Allies</HI> again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> would have &s;ent their Forces,
de&s;ign'd for maintaining the &s;aid Neutrality, to be
employ'd under his Command, as being the Party of|offended,
<PB N="344" REF="353">
and in Danger; but as they have not $word$
able hitherto, to execute their good Intentions, as the
Delays of the March of their Troops they had pro|$$i&s;ed,
and other Difficulties &s;ufficiently &s;hew; the mo&s;t
Serene King afore&s;aid, thinks him&s;elf Nece&s;&s;itated to
take without delay, &s;uch Mea&s;ures as are nece&s;&s;ary
for his Affairs, and for preventing the Inconvenien|cies,
and Damages afore-mention'd, and their Con&s;e|quences;
on the other Hand, the faithful States of
the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> will be no longer uncer|tain,
as wi&s;hing to &s;ee the Tranquility of their Coun|try
&s;ettled upon a firm Bottom.</P>
<P>But the Rea&s;ons alledg'd here, for the Pre&s;erva|tion
of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Saxony,</HI> are not the only Motives
that induce his <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty to make u&s;e of the
lawful Means afore&s;aid; but the Tranquility of the
holy <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, whereof the Pre&s;ervation is
chiefly committed to his Care, at this pre&s;ent time as
<HI>Vicar</HI> thereof, be&s;ides the Dignity of Director of the
Circle of <HI>Upper Saxony,</HI> does chiefly require this
from him; e&s;pecially, &s;eeing it is known that the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> has lately made an Alliance with the King
of <HI>France,</HI> the Tenor of which, could not be kept
a Secret, but that the <HI>Allies</HI> had notice of it: Be|&s;ides,
it is likewi&s;e known, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> in <HI>Pome|rania</HI>
wait only that the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> may ex|ecute
his Projects on the <HI>Upper Rhine,</HI> again&s;t the
Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, there being no doubt but they
would lay hold of that Opportunity to invade <HI>Saxony,</HI>
and the Provinces of <HI>Germany,</HI> rather than tho&s;e of
<HI>Poland:</HI> From whence it appears, how nece&s;&s;ary it
is to u&s;e proper Means in Time, that thro' the Di&s;per|&s;ion
of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> that Tran|quility
of the Holy <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, may be &s;ettled,
and pre&s;erv$d, that the dangerous Machinations,
afore &s;aid, may be prevented, and that the Fire hid
<PB N="345" REF="354">
under tho&s;e treacherous A&s;hes, may be Extingui&s;h'd
therefore no Body can blame the De&s;ign of the mo&s;t
Serene King of <HI>Poland,</HI> to provide for his Security,
and di&s;charge his Office with the Forces God has
given him, and the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Allies; Its further
more declared, on the Part of the mo&s;t Serene King
of <HI>Poland,</HI> that he has no other Intention and De|&s;ign,
but to procure the Security of the Holy <HI>Roman</HI>
Empire, and his own; and that he is induced to it
that the mo&s;t Serene <HI>Allies</HI> again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> will &s;ee
that the mo&s;t Serene <HI>Allies</HI> in the <HI>North,</HI> have made
&s;uch Di&s;po&s;itions, and taken &s;uch Mea&s;ures, that they
will more readily concur therein, and perform what
they are oblig'd to, by their Agreement; and this
happy <HI>Band of UNION</HI> among them&s;elves, which is
hitherto continued may remain in-di&s;oluble to their
Common Advantage.</P>
<P>THO' the King of <HI>Poland</HI> began this Part of
the War, in declaring the Intentions of the Allies,
yet the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> fir&s;t enter'd the Country,
that Prince perhaps glad to leave his own Domi|nions,
and his Capital City where the Plague
rag'd, at that Time, mo&s;t violently, enter'd the
<HI>Swedi&s;h Pomerania</HI> with his Army, the 8th of
<HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1711. And without any Re&s;i&s;tance, that
was con&s;iderable, advanced to the Neigbourhood
of <HI>Stral&s;ound.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this was too great an undertaking for the
King of <HI>Denmark's</HI> Army who were not full 20000
Men, without the King of Poland; however
in <HI>September,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> arriv'd, to the Number
of 12000 Men, and the two Armys being thus
joyn'd, they inve&s;ted <HI>Stral&s;und:</HI> But <HI>Stral&s;und</HI>
&s;trong by Situation, and well fortify'd, was too
knotty a Piece of Work, even for both the Kings
<PB N="346" REF="355">
united; for they found, that there was no In|ve&s;ting
it effectually, unle&s;s the <HI>I&s;le of Rugen,</HI>
which lies over-again&s;t it, &s;hould be fir&s;t reduc'd;
to prevent this, the <HI>Swedes</HI> had in that I&s;land, and
in the City, an Army of old Soldiers, Stronger
in Foot, than both the King's Armies put toge|ther,
tho' not equal to them in Hor&s;e; they like|wi&s;e
found, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> Daily relieved the
Town, by Sea, as they thought convenient;
having a Squadron of Men of War, and Frigats,
always in the Harbour; the&s;e Difficulties oblig'd
them at la&s;t to rai&s;e the Siege, without &s;o much
as carrying on any effectual Attack, or, &s;o much
as offering to Storm any of the Out-works. But
it mu&s;t be enquir'd a little how they &s;pent their
Time.</P>
<P>IT was the End of <HI>October</HI> before the <HI>Saxon</HI>
Artillery arriv'd in the Camp, as for the <HI>Danes,</HI>
they brought no heavy Cannon along with
them, but had &s;ome afterwards, when it was
too late.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, for a great while they amu&s;ed the
World with their Re&s;olutions to attack the <HI>I&s;le of
Rugen,</HI> and the <HI>Danes</HI> who under&s;tand Sea Affairs
better than the <HI>Saxons,</HI> contriv'd to make great
Rafts of Timber, on which to tran&s;port their
Hor&s;e; but the Arrival of &s;ome <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Fregats
who lay at a Di&s;tance, and batter'd tho&s;e Rafts,
and threw Bombs upon them, &s;hew'd the King
of <HI>Poland</HI> that the tran&s;porting their Cavalry
in that manner, would be impracticable.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, 12 <HI>Swedes</HI> Men of War
arriv'd on the Back of the I&s;land, and Landed
&s;ome Troops, and &s;ent 3 Ships about to <HI>Stral&s;und,</HI>
laden with Ammunition for the Garri&s;on, and
two more large Ships laden with Corn, which
<PB N="347" REF="356">
were <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Ships, that were bringing of Corn to
the <HI>Danish</HI> Army, which was in great want of it,
but they fell into the Hands of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and
the be&s;ieged had the Satisfaction of eating the
Bread which was furni&s;h'd for the Be&s;iegers.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Captain gave out, that a large
Embarkation of Troops and other Nece&s;&s;aries,
was pr&aacute;eparing at <HI>Carel&s;croon,</HI> and would &s;ail in a
few Days; this News di&s;courag'd the Be&s;iegers, and
in a Word, Provi&s;ions al&s;o growing very &s;carce,
in an exhau&s;ted Country, and the Sea&s;on ad|vancing,
the Troops &s;eparated, and gave over
the Enterprize for that Year. But I &s;hould have
mention'd, that before this, a &s;trong Detatch|ment
of 15000 <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> in 1$ Regiments, all
Infantry, arrived in the Camp; and a &s;trong Squa|dron
of <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Men of War, came to the Back
of the <HI>I&s;land of Rugen,</HI> pretending to &s;upport the
Allies in attacking of the Town but it was too late.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was all this while Carry|ing
on his Intere&s;ts of one kind or another, on the
Frontiers of <HI>Tartary,</HI> by Negotiations with the
<HI>Turks,</HI> on the Subject of Peace, of which, in its
Place.</P>
<P>HE arriv'd the 24th of <HI>October</HI> at <HI>Torgau</HI> on the
<HI>Elb,</HI> where the Marriage of his elde&s;t and only
Son was &s;olemniz'd with the Prince&s;s of <HI>Wolfem|buttel;</HI>
an happy Match, of an unhappy Son!</P>
<P>THIS Marriage had been concerted for &s;ome
Time, but was not con&s;ummated till the latter
End of the Year; the View that the <HI>Czar</HI> had in
this Match, was very well lay'd, for as his <HI>Cza|ri&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty always aim'd at the getting a Footing,
by &s;ome Means or other, in the Empire of <HI>Germany,</HI>
he did not que&s;tion but by this Alliance, &s;ome
Pretentions might in Time ari&s;e, to give him
<PB N="348" REF="357">
Room to intermedle on that Side, as afterwards
he try'd again in the Dutchy of <HI>Mecklemberg,</HI> but
both without Succe&s;s, as &s;hall appear in its
Place.</P>
<P>BUT ro return to the Siege of <HI>Strael&s;und,</HI> the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Infantry having joyn'd the Confede|rate
Army, and the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> Artillery
being all arriv'd, and a <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Squadron of Men
of War &s;uperiour to the <HI>Swedish,</HI> the World ex|pected
they would go on with Succe&s;s; but we
&s;hall &s;ee this Part re&s;erv'd for a further Exerci&s;e of
their Patience.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Danes</HI> indeed, out did them&s;elves on this
Occa&s;ion, at Sea; for their Fleet con&s;i&s;ted, if
we may believe the Li&s;t they publi&s;h'd, of 36
Men of War of the Line of Battle, from 50
Guns the lea&s;t, to 110 Guns the highe&s;t, and
eight Fregats; but we &s;hall never &s;ee them fit
out &s;uch a Fleet again, neither were the&s;e all at
Sea together; nor were tho&s;e that were out fully
mann'd for an Engagement: However, the <HI>Swedes</HI>
had no Fleet able to look the&s;e in the Face,
&s;o that their Affairs, had they managed them
rightly, were in a fair way, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> mu&s;t
have yielded up the Town. Their Troops

<P>THIS was a great Army, had they been well
apply'd, and well &s;upply'd, but the Sea&s;on of the
Year was too far gone; they had u&s;ed the Coun|try
ill at their fir&s;t coming, e&s;pecially the <HI>Danes,</HI>
&s;o that if the poor People who would have &s;upp|ly'd
them, had neither Corn nor Forrage left
them to bring to the Camp; in a Word, the
Country was Exhau&s;ted, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> at the
Beginning &s;cour'd the Seas &s;o, that nothing could
come that Way; for the <HI>Danes</HI> Fleet came too
late, and when 'twas to no Purpo&s;e to open
Trenches, the whether being Cold, and begining
to freez; this made their Soldiers dye and defert
for meer Want, and the Severity of the Weather
and &s;ervice; &s;o that the <HI>Danes</HI> Foot were reduc'd
to a Handful, the Cavalry was ruin'd and the
Hor&s;e &s;tarv'd; and in a Word, the <HI>Danes</HI> did not
march off above 9000 effective Men, <HI>as we were
told,</HI> out of 21800 they brought with them as
above.</P>
<P>AS for the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Troops they came late, but
they brought &s;ome Stores with them, which a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed
them, and yet they &s;uffer'd very much too,
and were extremly fateigu'd with long Mar|ches.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Siege, as the Difficul|ties
and Hard&s;hips the Troops indured were
great, &s;o their Councils were divided; the able&s;t
Generals were of Opinion, to rai&s;e the Siege, hold
the Place block'd up during the <HI>Winter,</HI> and At|tack
it early in the Spring with 60000 Men;
others were for carrying it on, whatever it co&s;t;
<PB N="350" REF="359">
and to that Purpo&s;e to &s;end for more Troops,
and both the Kings were really loath to break
up the Siege, e&s;pecially, while the <HI>Danish</HI> Fleet
was &s;o &s;trong, and the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Fleet dur&s;t not
appear.</P>
<P>BUT a new Piece of Advice alter'd their
Mea&s;ures, the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> had Advice that
the <HI>Swedes</HI> prepar$d a great Fleet of Tran&s;ports
at <HI>Carel&s;croon,</HI> with a Convoy of 28 Capital
Men of War, and that they Shipp'd 18000 Men,
on Board this Fleet, under the Command of Count
<HI>Stienboch,</HI> a Name terrible to the <HI>Danes;</HI> this
brought the King immediately to con&s;ider, how
naked he had left his Capital City, the Army
and Fleet being all here; and that if the <HI>Swedes</HI>
&s;hould go directly to <HI>Copenbagen,</HI> they would ruin
him at once, while he was pu&s;hing a foreign
Project.</P>
<P>WITH this Apprehen&s;ion, which was very

<P>ABOUT the Beginning of <HI>November</HI> this Year,

him&s;elf, with great Affection aud Tenderne&s;s:
But we &s;hall &s;ay more of this Affair hereafter,
perhaps in a Treati&s;e by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e things were in agitation, the
<HI>Turks</HI> began to di&s;cover &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s at the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> not having perform'd the Articles of the
late Peace, particularly that, about the Surren|der
of <HI>A&s;opb,</HI> and the withdrawing the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI>

to have the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI> Pa&s;&s;age &s;ettled
fir&s;t, for his Return to his own Dominions; but
the <HI>Turks</HI> were po&s;itive, and in&s;i&s;ted that the
manner of his Return was not any Part of the
Condition, upon which the evacuating of <HI>A&s;opb</HI>
was &s;tipulated.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="361">
AFTER many Debates on either Side, the
<HI>Czar</HI> not having the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ions of the
manner of his Return, one Way or other, re|&s;olv'd
to perform his Part of the Treaty; and
accordingly order'd all the additional Works at
<HI>A&s;oph</HI> to be demoli&s;h'd, and the royal Fort over|again&s;t
it with the magnificent Bridge, the mo&s;t
beautiful Building in that Part of the World, to
be all blown up in the Air, and the Town to be
put in the &s;ame Po&s;ture at was before, and then
gave it up to three Ba&s;&s;a's, who were &s;ent with
&s;ome Troops from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to receive it; at
the &s;ame time, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty declared to
the Court of the Grand Seignior, that he would
oppo&s;e the <HI>Turks</HI> by Force, if they offer'd to
&s;end back the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> either through his
Dominions, or through the King of <HI>Poland's</HI>
Country with an Army, or with more than
5000 Hor&s;e, the Number propo&s;ed; and thus
ended that knotty Bu&s;ine&s;s, the only Action
of his Life, which the <HI>Czar</HI> had brought to
Account of Lo&s;s, where he led his Armies in
Per&s;on having never been per&s;onally defeated
before.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now look back again to <HI>Pomerania,</HI>
to lay a Foundation of &s;ome great Actions, which
will bring his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty into the Field on
this Side of the World, where he was, perhaps,
lea&s;t expected: The Siege of <HI>Strael&s;und</HI> was rai&s;ed,
as has been ob&s;erv'd, and the two Kings of <HI>Den|mark</HI>
and <HI>Poland</HI> gone Home, and their Troops
put into <HI>Winter</HI> Quarters. In this Interval, the
<HI>Swedes</HI> brought over more Troops; and together
with tho&s;e already there, form$d a con&s;iderable
Army and that, &s;uch a one, as they threaten'd
to invade their Enemies with, on every Side,
<PB N="353" REF="362">
and particularly, they were greatly alarm'd
with the Apprehen&s;ions of them in <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>THIS made his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, at the pre&s;|&s;ing
In&s;tances of the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> and
<HI>Poland,</HI> prepared for an early Campaign, and
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd to be there al&s;o
in Per&s;on; accordingly 25000 <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> of the
choice&s;t of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Army, began
their March &s;o early, that they were upon
the Frontiers of <HI>Pomerania</HI> by the End of <HI>April;</HI>
the <HI>Danes</HI> were longer, becau&s;e their Naval Pre|parations

<P>THE <HI>Swedes</HI> in the Mean time had Ship'd off

yet to leave the Cities of <HI>Stetin</HI> and <HI>Strael&s;und</HI>
with &s;ufficient Garri&s;ons to defend them&s;elves in
Ca&s;e of an Attack; they had al&s;o put a &s;ufficient
Number of Troops into <HI>Wi&s;mar,</HI> which the <HI>Danes</HI>
had in vain block'd up, the Year before: The
King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> was plea&s;ed &s;o far to favour this
War again&s;t <HI>Sweden,</HI> that he gave Pa&s;&s;age to
Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI>

<P><HI>Europe</HI> had now been allarm'd for &s;everal Months

by his own Intere&s;t, and by the Solicitation of the
Cham of <HI>Tartray,</HI> had prevailed with the Grand
Seignior to break again with the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
<PB N="354" REF="363">

on) yet very unju&s;t, but as his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
had in the fir&s;t Place, perform'd the la&s;t Treaty
in every Part of it; and more-over, that Ways
and Means were found oat to bring over the
Cham of <HI>Tartary,</HI> from the Intere&s;t of the King
of <HI>Sweden:</HI> A new Treaty was &s;et on Foot, at
<HI>Cor&s;tantinople,</HI> which was at length fini&s;h'd, and
&s;ign'd, the principal Articles are as follows.</P>
<P>I. THAT the <HI>Czar</HI> &s;hall be oblig'd within 30
Days to withdraw all his Forces out of <HI>Po|land,</HI>
which &s;hall not return thither upon any
Pretence what&s;oever, unle&s;s it &s;hould happen that the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI> being return'd into his Dominions,
&s;hould joyn with the <HI>Poles</HI> and attack <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>
on that Side, in which Ca&s;e his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
&s;hall be at Liberty to march again into <HI>Poland</HI> with
his <HI>Troops.</HI></P>
<P>II. That the <HI>Port</HI> &s;hall be allow'd to procure the
Return of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> into his Dominions,
by &s;uch Ways as the Grand Seignior &s;hall think fit,
without allowing the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> to fix the Time of
his Departure, or his Way; but in ca&s;e that
Prince marches through the Territories of <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI>
the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Troops that &s;hall attend him,
&s;hall commit no manner of Ho&s;tilities or Ravages.</P>
<P>III. That the <HI>Czar</HI> &s;hall remain in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<HI>Kiou</HI> and <HI>Ukrania,</HI> with their ancient <HI>Limits,</HI> but
shall renounce all his Pretentions to the Country of
<PB N="355" REF="364">
the Co&s;&s;acks on this &s;ide of the <HI>Borifthenes,</HI> that
are not in the Dependance of <HI>Kiof,</HI> and on a certain
I&s;land in that River, and that good Orders &s;hall be
given on both &s;ides, to prevent the Excur&s;ions of the
<HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> and <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>IV. That for the Future, no Fortre&s;s &s;hall be
erected between the two Frontier Places of A&s;oph
and <HI>Ciraski</HI> by either of the Parties, and that the
Forts erected by the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> in the Teritories of
A&s;oph &s;hall be demoli&s;h'd in four Months, but that
the Grand Signior &s;hall be at Liberty to rebuild
the Fort of <HI>Cinoli,</HI> over-again&s;t A&s;oph.</P>
<P>V. That whereas by the Articles of the Treaty
concluded at <HI>Moldavia,</HI> it was &s;tipulated that <HI>A&s;oph</HI>
&s;hould be re&s;tor'd in the &s;ame Condition that it was in
when the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> took it, and that it appears
that there were then in that Place 60 Pieces of Bra&s;s
Cannon, which have not been found therein when it
was re&s;tor'd; his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;hall be obliged to
re&s;tore the &s;aid Artillery, or pay the Value thereof,
and the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hall deliver to the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> the
Iron Cannon that they have left in that Place.</P>
<P>VI. That none of the Parties &s;hall be allow'd
to erect any Forts at <HI>Comenski</HI> and <HI>Savar,</HI> which
by Virtue of the Treaty of <HI>Moldavia</HI> have been de|moli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>VII. That the Peace &s;hall be continu'd 25 Years,
to reckon from the &s;igning of the Treaty, but may
be prolonged before that time is elap&s;ed; and la&s;tly,
that after the Ratification of the pre&s;ent Treaty,
the <HI>Czar</HI> &s;hall be allow'd to &s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador to
Con&s;tantinople to receive the &s;ame, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>BY the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Troops
arriv'd in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> commanded by Prince <HI>Men|zikoff,</HI>
and encamped at <HI>Schweds,</HI> having there
<PB N="356" REF="365">
a Bridge over the <HI>Oder,</HI> being the &s;ame Place
where <HI>Gu&s;tav$s Adolphus,</HI> the Great King of <HI>Swe|den</HI>
encamp'd, when he reduced that Country;
but notwith&s;tanding all this, the <HI>Danes</HI> did not
appear, and in a Word, the <HI>Czar</HI> was fain to re|mit
them 90000 Crowns before they could &s;tir
out of their Quarters: With this Relief, the King
of <HI>Denmark</HI> came to his Army at <HI>Itzhoe</HI> the 10th
of <HI>July,</HI> and when all the World expected him
to march Into <HI>Pomerania</HI> to joyn the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> and
<HI>Saxon</HI> Armies, his <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty turn'd his
Arms another Way, and pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>El$,</HI> enter'd
the Dutchy of <HI>Bremen,</HI> then-under the Govern|ment
of Count <HI>Welling</HI> for the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI>
and not to enter into that Part of the Story too
far, he reduced it entirely, and with it the Coun|try
of <HI>Verden,</HI> and afterwards Morgag'd them to
the King of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> which will give
Occa&s;ion of farther Hi&s;tory to relate the Affair
which attended that Mortgage.</P>
<P>THIS Attempt was a Diver&s;ion, however, to
the Arms of <HI>Sweden;</HI> as was al&s;o the Attack of
<HI>Wi&s;mar,</HI> which the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> and the
<HI>Hanover</HI> Troops, for the King of <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI>
as Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> had declared
again&s;t <HI>Sweden</HI> al&s;o, held block'd up a great
while.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Affair of <HI>Pomerania,</HI> his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty arrived in that Country the
26th of <HI>July,</HI> and it was time to enter upon
Action.</P>
<P>I cannot omit, in this Place, (tho' it be a
Tran&s;ition at once, from the <HI>Baltick</HI> Shore, to
the <HI>Black Sea</HI>) to mention that the good Under|&s;tanding
at this time &s;ettled between the <HI>Turks</HI>
and the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Ma&s;covy,</HI> was &s;o firm and pro|mi&s;ing,
<PB N="357" REF="366">
notwith&s;tanding all the Mannagement
of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and his Friends, that no|thing
could be better e&s;tabli&s;h'd; and the World
wat &s;urpriz'd to hear that the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Re&s;ident
at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> had made a formal Rejoycing,
or Fe&s;tival in that City, on the Birth-Day of
his Ma&s;ter, the <HI>Czar;</HI> this being what was not
u&s;ually allow'd by the <HI>Turks</HI> to any Princes Am|ba&s;&s;adors,
was done the more publickly now,
that the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> might &s;ee that the great
Boa&s;t that the <HI>Swedes</HI> had made of the powerful
Intere&s;t that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had at <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI>
was really nothing in Sub&s;tance, and
that the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hew'd all po&s;ible Honours to
the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador: The Particulars of this
Rejoycing are very remarkable, as follows.</P>
<P>&startq;The 10th of this Month being the Fe&s;tival of
St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> the fir&s;t being the Name
of the <HI>Czar,</HI> the Baron de <HI>Schapfir of,</HI> Vice-Chancellor
of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, his Privy-Councellor,
and his Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordina|ry
and Plenipotentiary at the Port, gave a great
Entertainment upon that Account, and al&s;o for
celebrating the Anniver&s;ary of the famous Bat|tle
of <HI>Pultowa,</HI> tho' he had already ob&s;erv'd
the &s;ame two Days before with Illuminations in
his Hou&s;e. All the Amba&s;&s;adors re&s;iding here
were invited to the &s;ame, as were al&s;o the
Re&s;ident of the Emperor, the Vicar of the
Pope, the Secretaries of Amba&s;&s;adors, and
the chief Merchants of all Nations, &s;o that
there was an Appearance of above 100 Per|&s;ons,
for whom there were &s;even Tables,
and they were treated with an extraordinary
Magnificence. During the Entertainment
<PB N="358" REF="367">
there was a fine Con&s;ort of Vocal and In&s;tru|mental
Mu&s;ick, and after the &s;ame, the Com|pany
was entertained with a Comedy in the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Tongues. The Secretary
Interpreter of the Amba&s;&s;y, pronounced after|wards
the Panegyrick of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
in <HI>Latin,</HI> and another Gentleman recited &s;ome
Epigrams on the &s;ubject of the Fea&s;t, to the
Satisfaction of the Company, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Col|lonels
of the Jannizaries of the Guard, had
cau&s;ed the Doors of the Hou&s;e of the Amba&s;&s;a|dors
of that Prince to be adorn'd with Fe&s;toons
of Palm, Lawrel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Civility the
Vice Chancellor afore-&s;aid, acknowledg'd with
a Pre&s;ent. The Windows of the Hon&s;e were
illuminated at Night with Emblems of the He|roick
Actions of the <HI>Czar;</HI> and there was a
Fire-work repre&s;enting the Arms of that
Prince, his Name in Cyphers, and the Town of
<HI>Pultowa</HI> with proper De&s;criptions. On the
&s;ide of that Fire there were two Decorations,
each repre&s;enting two Hearts united, and upon
one there were this In&s;cription, <HI>Long live the
Emperor</HI> Perer I. <HI>and the Empre&s;s</HI> Catherina;
and on the other, <HI>Long live the Prince Imperial</HI>
Alexis, <HI>and the Prince&s;&s; Imperial</HI> Charlote. The&s;e
two Decorations continued illuminated all
Night, and the two Nights following, and the
Fea&s;t concluded with a B$ll, which la&s;ted till the
next Morning, and during the &s;ame there was
a magnificent Collation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Fire-work
and the Illuminations were expre&s;ly noted in
the Con&s;ent given by the Port to that Enter|tainment,
which has been &s;eldom allow'd to any
Foreigm Mini&s;ters, and e&s;pecially in <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI>
which &s;heweth the Value the <HI>Turks</HI> put
<PB N="359" REF="368">
$upon the Friendship of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, and
their E&s;teem for his Mini&s;ters.&endq;</P>
<P>BUT to return to <HI>Pomerania,</HI> where the <HI>Czar</HI>
and King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> now commanded in Per&s;on,
as above, the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> being employ'd
in the Reduction of <HI>Bremen,</HI> as before; yet the
<HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Fleet put to Sea in aid of the <HI>Pomeranian</HI>
War, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> having been at Sea, to bring
over Troops of Reinforcement to the <HI>I&s;le of Ru|gen,</HI>
the <HI>Danes</HI> attack'd them in their Return,
and had a &s;harp Fight, but the <HI>Swedes</HI> having
done their Bu&s;ine&s;s, made a rnnning Fight over
to their own Coa&s;t, and the <HI>Danes</HI> could do no
more but fall in among the Tran&s;ports, of which
they de&s;troy'd near 20: However, the <HI>Danes,</HI> to
keep their Reputation a-float; which, as to their
War with the <HI>Swedes</HI> &s;hrunk very low, the <HI>Swedes</HI>
always beating them, cry'd this up for a great
Victory: But this has not been his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje|&s;ty's
Method to boa&s;t of Victory, when he had
won nothing from his Enemy; the Truth is, if
any had the Victory, it was the <HI>Swedes,</HI> for they
did their Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> landed their Troops;
and their Bu&s;ine&s;s then, was not to Fight, but
to go back to fetch more, which they al&s;o did,
notwith&s;tanding all the <HI>Danes</HI> could do.</P>
<P>HAD the <HI>Danes</HI> met them at Sea, with their
Army on Board, and fought them then, had they
either &s;unk or taken any of the Men of War, or
hinder'd their going to land the Troops, and
made them go back again with them to their
own Coa&s;t, there had been a Victory indeed;
but as it was, the boa&s;ting of a Victory, becau&s;e
the Swedes declin'd a clo&s;e Engagement, and
<PB N="360" REF="369">
the taking a few empty Tran&s;ports was rather
a Ga&s;conade than any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Troops which the <HI>Swedes</HI> landed amount|ed
to 2000 Hor&s;e, and 7000 Foot, Which added
to the Forces they had before, made the At|tempt
upon that I&s;land appear impracticable,
and &s;o the <HI>Czar</HI> and the King of <HI>Poland</HI> lay'd
the Thought of it a&s;ide, for that Year al&s;o,
while the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Rugen</HI> is not reduc'd.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty therefore, finding no|thing
con&s;iderable could be done more, and his
Affairs calling his Maje&s;ty to <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> he left
the Army the 7th of <HI>October,</HI> under the Com|mand
of Prince <HI>Galiczin;</HI> but with Direction
to obey in all things, the Orders of King <HI>Au|gu&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>THE Army was then &s;o po&s;ted, as to hold
both <HI>Stral&s;ond</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;mar</HI> block'd up all the
<HI>Winter;</HI> which contributed greatly to the further
Di$tre&s;&s;ing the Enemy, who, notwith&s;tanding
their Reinforcement, could do nothing con&s;idera|ble,
till they had yet another Embarkation of
Troops from <HI>Sweden,</HI> as we &s;hall &s;ee pre|&s;ently.</P>
<P>BUT now we mu&s;t come in its Turn to do
Ju&s;tice to our Enemies, and to &s;hew what Mea|&s;ures
they took, in the Pro&s;ecution of this War:
The <HI>Czar</HI> who was the Life of the War, being
gone, and the Armies being left, as I have &s;aid,
to the Order of King <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who
were now grown &s;trong by the arriving of the
Succours above named, tran&s;ported their Troops
over from the <HI>I&s;le of Rugen</HI> to <HI>Stral&s;ond,</HI> and
Count <HI>Steenbock</HI> who commanded them, form'd
an Army of 18000 Men in the Plain, under the
Cannon of <HI>Stral&s;ond,</HI> and began to threaten to
<PB N="361" REF="370">
act offen&s;ively; nor were the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI>
Army in the be&s;t Condition to receive them, ha|ving
been much dimini&s;h'd and fateigu'd by the
Service, and much want of Provi&s;ions be&s;ides.
If Count <HI>Steinbock</HI> had re&s;olv'd to attack them,
&s;o near Hand, he could have drawn eight or nine
thou&s;and Men more out of the Garri&s;ons of
<HI>Stral&s;ond, Grip&s;wald,</HI> and other Places, which he
could not do when he &s;hould march farther from
their own Territories.</P>
<P>THINGS &s;tanding thus, King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> and the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> General Count <HI>Galiczen,</HI> order'd their Po&s;ts
to be intrenched, and the &s;everal Pa&s;&s;es by
which the <HI>Swedes</HI> might march out, to be forti|fy'd
with very good Lines and Redoubts, and
po&s;ted their Troops in them to oppo&s;e their
Enemies.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Swedes</HI> are allow'd to be a daring and
Enterprizing People, &s;o their Generals are uni|ver&s;ally
Men that under&s;tand their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
want no military Experience: Count <HI>Steinbock</HI>
being now once more at the Head of an Army,
and <HI>Pomerania</HI> being no Place to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them in
at this Time, When it was &s;o exhau&s;ted by other
Troops, that it &s;tarv'd its own Inhabitants, he
re&s;olv'd to pu&s;h out, and try the Fortune of the
Field; accordingly he began his March the 3d
of <HI>November,</HI> and having forc'd the Pa&s;s of <HI>Dam|garten,</HI>
which the frighted <HI>Saxons</HI> quited, and let
him pa&s;s by, much too cheap; he entered the
County of <HI>Mecklemburgh</HI> with his whole Ar|my,
the 6th, and marched directly towards <HI>Wi&s;mar.</HI></P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY upon this News, away run the
<HI>Danes,</HI> who had roo&s;ted all the <HI>Summer</HI> at <HI>Ro&s;tock,</HI>
and other <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Regiments likewi&s;e; who car|ry'd
<PB N="362" REF="371">
on the Blockade of <HI>Wi&s;mar</HI> marched off with
the greate&s;t Precipitation, nor to hazard their
Rear, which the Garri&s;on pre&s;s'd upon, but were
di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>THE Dominions of <HI>Denmark</HI> upon the Conti|nent
were allarm'd at this March, and the King
of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who&s;e Troops lay about <HI>Hamburgh,</HI>
from which City they had, drawn about 260000
Rix Dollars, began to gather togther, and to ad|vance
for fear of being cut off from joyning
their <HI>Allies</HI> the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> without whom, they
were not able, as will appear pre&s;ently, to look
their Enemies in the Face.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Denmark</HI> ha&s;ten'd likewi&s;e to
his Army, he left <HI>Gottorp</HI> the 19th, and having
joyn'd General <HI>Schoult</HI> and all his Troops, ad|vanc'd
to meet the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who were as forward
as his Maje&s;ty to come to Action: This Excur|&s;ion
of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> as it relates to the War, in
which his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was &s;o much concern'd,
cannot be omitted here, or the Acton which fol|low'd
it, becau&s;e it would render the Hi&s;tory of
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty uncompleat, the <HI>Czar</HI> having
acted in it pre&s;ently afterwards in Per&s;on,
with all his Army; the Story of the Excur&s;ion
of the <HI>Swedes</HI> is ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary, that it
may appear how ill the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> did their
Part; for certainly, if they had done their Duty
at the Pa&s;s of <HI>Damgarten,</HI> which they pretended
to Guard, and which, as will appear by the Ac|count
following, a few Troops well di&s;po&s;ed,
might have defended, the <HI>Swedes</HI> could never have
broke through, and then all the Lo&s;s and Di&s;|grace,
and all the Mi&s;eries that the King of <HI>Den|mark</HI>'s
Dominions &s;uffer'd af$erwards had been
Prevented; whereas it was manife&s;t, by what
<PB N="363" REF="372">
follow'd, and if the <HI>Czar</HI> had not afterwards
come to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, his <HI>Da$i&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
had been utterly ruin'd at that Time.</P>
<P>The Account of this Action, as publi&s;h'd by
the <HI>Swedes,</HI> is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>From the Head Quarters of Count Steinbock at
Ribitz, <DATE>November 5. 1712.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>&startq;ALL the Troops that were in the <HI>I&s;land
of Rugen,</HI> having been brought over to
<HI>Strael&s;und</HI> the 30th pa&s;t, in the Evening, with
their Baggage, Count <HI>Steinboch,</HI> Commander
in Chief of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army, took his Leave
the next Day of the Garri&s;on and Burghers of
<HI>Strael&s;und,</HI> who were drawn up in Arms, to
whom he made a pathetick Speech, wherein he
exorted them to continue Faithful to their So|vereign
and Country, and be Vigilant in their
&s;everal Stations for the Pre&s;ervation of that
Place. The &s;ame Night he gave Orders to the
Generals of the Army, and the next Day the
Troops began to move, it being given out, that
they were to attack the Lines of the Enemy
before <HI>Strael&s;und.</HI> The general Di&s;po&s;ition of
their March was as follows; Lieutenant Gene|ral
<HI>Ducker,</HI> who commanded the Van-Guard,
con&s;i&s;ting of the Cavalry of the Dutchy of
<HI>Bremen,</HI> and the Dragoons of <HI>Marderfeldt</HI> and
<HI>Stromfeldt,</HI> with nine Pieces of Cannon, was
to march with all Speed towards <HI>Damgarten,</HI> to
take Po&s;t there, and lay Bridges over that Ri|ver,
before the Enemy could draw their Troops
<PB N="364" REF="373">
together, and hinder the <HI>Swedes</HI> from pa&s;&s;ing
the &s;ame; and as the Succe&s;s of the whole
Enterprize depended in a great Mea&s;ure on
the Secrecy and Expedition of the March of
this Body; Care had been taken for three Days
together, that none &s;hould go out of <HI>Strael|&s;und</HI>
or the Camp, to inform the Enemy there|with.
General <HI>Ducker</HI> with his Detatch|ments,
continu'd all that Night at <HI>Ribbartz,</HI>
from whence the Adjutant General <HI>Leppenon</HI>
was detatch'd with 200 Men toward <HI>Frautz|bergh</HI>
to ob&s;erve the Motions of the Enemy
behind their Lines, and give timely Notice
thereof. Lieutenant General <HI>Taube</HI> with the
Cavalry of the Province of <HI>We&s;tergothland,</HI> a
<HI>Pomeranian</HI> Regiment of Hor&s;e, and one of
Foot of Colonel <HI>Ekeblad</HI> encamped that Night
at <HI>Karnin,</HI> having under him Major General
<HI>A&s;henberg.</HI> This was the Body of Battle, and
the Rear commanded by Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> him|&s;elf,
and under him by Major General <HI>Patkul,</HI>
con&s;i&s;ted of the re&s;t of the Hor&s;e, Foot and
Artillery. The&s;e were followed by 1500
Boors, carrying Deal Boards and other Matte|rials
to lay Bridges. The Roads being very
bad by Rea&s;on of Rainy Weather, the Rear of
the Army could not march from Noon till the
Evening, above one League, and encamped at
Pyts. King <HI>Stani&s;la$s</HI> came after the Rear
with his Retinue, The 2d, Lieutenant Gene|ral
<HI>Ducker</HI> advanced to <HI>Damgarten,</HI> where he
took Po&s;t, and marched immediately through a
Defile to a &s;mall Fort, or Redoubt, the Enemy
had erected on the other Side near <HI>Ribnitz,</HI>
which he took Sword in Hand, whereby the
Enemy had many Men kill'd and Wounded.
<PB N="365" REF="374">
Lieutenant General <HI>Taube</HI> continu'd at <HI>Kar|nin</HI>
till Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> came up with the
Rear, and then they march'd together to <HI>Lan|gen-Han&s;agen.</HI>
The following Day, being the
3d In&s;tant, they march'd by Break of Day to
<HI>Damgarten,</HI> where all the Troops joyn'd about
Noon, the General taking his Quarters at <HI>Blom|mon&s;dorf</HI>
on the River <HI>Ribnits,</HI> within a Quar|ter
of a League of that Place. That River
has on both &s;ides a long and deep Mora&s;s, which
e&s;pecially on the &s;ide of <HI>Mecklemburgh</HI> was &s;aid
to be unpa&s;&s;able even for Cattle tho' in the hot|te&s;t
Summer; but however, Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> re|&s;olved
to try whether his Troops could go over it
or no. In order thereunto, he commanded Boards
and Planks to be joyn'd together, to &s;erve
in&s;tead of Bridges over &s;uch Places as &s;hould
appear too deep to be pa&s;s'd otherwi&s;e, and
po&s;ted 400 Foot with 8 Field Pieces, on the
Banks of the River to cover the Men who
were &s;ent before to take a View of the Mora&s;s,
and to &s;ee which way it might be more con|veniently
pa&s;s'd over. The Enemy who ob|&s;erv'd
the&s;e Motions, po&s;ted about 1000 Hor&s;e,
on the other &s;ide of the Mora&s;s, but were ob|lig'd
to quit that Po&s;t by the extraordinary Fire,
that was made from the Field Pieces afbre&s;aid,
and retire into the Wood. The <HI>Swedes</HI> po&s;ted
at <HI>Damgarten</HI> fir'd al&s;o upon them, and they
had above 90 Men kill'd and wounded. The
General order'd the Pontons to be brought
down the River, with other Materials for Brid|ges
over the &s;aid Mora&s;s, and at <HI>Damgarten,</HI>
which were fini&s;h'd that Night. The Generals
being call'd together, Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> gave
them the following Directions for the next
<PB N="366" REF="375">
Day. Lieutenant General <HI>Ducker</HI> was order'd
to pa&s;s over the Bridge laid at <HI>Damgarten,</HI>
with &s;ix Pieces of Cannon and the Vanguard
of the Army, con&s;i&s;ting of the Regiments of
Dragoons of <HI>Marderfeldt</HI> and <HI>Stromfeldt,</HI>
the Cavalry of <HI>We&s;tergothland</HI> and <HI>Bremen,</HI>
and the Regiments of Foot of <HI>Ekebladt,
Schultz,</HI> and <HI>Elf$org;</HI> while Count <HI>Steinboch</HI>
him&s;elf and Lieutenant General <HI>Taube</HI> with the
re&s;t of the Foot and eight Field Pieces &s;hould
pa&s;s the River and Mora&s;s by <HI>Blommendorf.</HI>
The re&s;t of the Cavalry was order'd, if po&s;|&s;ible,
to march after them; but in ca&s;e they
found it too long and difficult, they were order'd
to pa&s;s over the Bridge of <HI>Damgarten,</HI> under
the Command of the Majors General <HI>A&s;henberg;</HI>
and <HI>Mere&s;chal.</HI> The 400 Foot po&s;ted on the
Bank of the River afore&s;aid, under the Com|mand
of Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Slippenback</HI> and
Major <HI>Lewenhaupt,</HI> were order'd to march fir&s;t
of all over the Mora&s;s, and take Po&s;t on the
other &s;ide. The&s;e were to be follow'd by the
Detatchment who carry'd the Planks and
Bridges de&s;igned to be laid over the deep or un|pa&s;&s;able
Places of the &s;aid Mora&s;s. Major Ge|neral
<HI>Patkul</HI> was to march next with the Regi|ments
of <HI>Sudermania, Dalecarlia,</HI> and <HI>We&s;ter|gotbland.</HI>
The&s;e were to be follow'd by the
Prince <HI>de la Gardic,</HI> who brought up the Rear
with the Regiments of <HI>O&s;tergothland, We&s;tman|land,
Helfinge$,</HI> and the two Regiments of the
Provinces of <HI>Narike</HI> and <HI>Wermerland.</HI> Lieu|tenant
General <HI>Cron&s;tedt</HI> was order'd to follow
the Infantry with the Artillery, but if he did
not find it practicable, he was commanded to
march after the Cavalry by <HI>Damgarten.</HI> Col|lonel
<PB N="367" REF="376">
<HI>Rozen</HI> with 600 Hor&s;e and 500 Foot was
order'd to guard the Avenues to <HI>Damgarten,</HI>
that the Enemy might not attack the Baggage
which was &s;ent thither. Adjutant General <HI>Lop|penon</HI>
with his 200 Hor&s;e came the &s;ame Night
from <HI>Frautsbergh,</HI> and reported that the Enemy
were quiet in their Lines, and he had met only
with a Party of <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> of whom he had kill'd
$ix. According to the Di&s;po&s;itions afore&s;aid,
the March begun the following Day, the Sol|diers
carrying along with them Pla$ks and all
the Doors they could get from the Hou&s;es, and
be&s;ides every other Man carry'd a Fa&s;cine to fill
&s;uch Holes as they &s;hould meet in their way,
whereby not only the Infantry but even the
Artillery pa&s;s'd in good Order over the Mora&s;s,
Which as it has been &s;aid before, was thought
impa&s;&s;able even for the Cattle in the <HI>Summer</HI>
Time. The General &s;eeing there was no Ene|my
to oppo&s;e him on the other &s;ide of the Mo|ra&s;s,
order'd the Cavalry to pa&s;s over the
Bridge at <HI>Damgarten,</HI> and the whole Army be|ing
on the other &s;ide in the Country of <HI>Mack|lenburgh,</HI>
was drawn up in Order of Battle,
and made a general Salvo of their 8 Field
Pieces and &s;mall Arms for this happy Succe&s;s
in their Pa&s;&s;age, without the Lo&s;s of one Man,
and which has rendred u&s;ele&s;s the &s;trong Lines
on which the Enemy have been employ'd about
a Year. The Prince of <HI>Wey&s;&s;enfeldt,</HI> who com|manded
3000 Men on that &s;ide, retired to|wards
<HI>Ro&s;tock,</HI> but not thinking him&s;elf Safe
in that Place retired farther, and Colonel <HI>Ba&s;|&s;e$$itz</HI>
was &s;ent to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="377">
UPON the News of this Succe&s;&s; of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI>
General, the <HI>Czar</HI> who was then at <HI>Dre&s;den,</HI> took
Po&s;t immediately to put him&s;elf at the Head of
his Army in <HI>Pomeren,</HI> where he arrived the 25th,
having before order'd a &s;trong Reinforcement of
Troops to joyn them.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was there with his Army alrea|dy,
&s;o that Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> had no le&s;s than 3 Mo|narchs
at the Head of three Armies to encounter
with, and was &s;o &s;urrounded by them, that they
made no Que&s;tion to give a very good Account
of him; and for this Rea&s;on it was, that the <HI>Czar</HI>
re&s;ented very much a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms for 15
Days, which was agreed between Count <HI>Stein|boch</HI>
and the <HI>Allies,</HI> and &s;poke with &s;ome Tokens
of Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> on that
Account; but when his Maje&s;ty came to the
Army, that General convinc'd him, that King
<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had agreed to it without his Participati|on,
that he had oppo&s;ed it, and that he would have
had the <HI>Saxons</HI> to have joyn'd in following the
<HI>Swedes,</HI> till they &s;hould be forced to Fight all the
three Armies together.</P>
<P>IT is true, the <HI>Saxons</HI> were not ready, nor the
King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> &s;o that King <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> acted
upon a ju&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity; and when he lay'd the
Rea&s;ons before the <HI>Czar,</HI> and convinc'd him that
he had no private Treaty in Hand, either with
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or with <HI>Stani&s;laus,</HI> who was
then in the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
was better &s;atisfied, and the two Armies ad|vanc'd
to <HI>Gu&s;traw,</HI> where his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
had his Quarters; the <HI>Danes</HI> who likewi&s;e had
not agreed to the Ce&s;&s;ation, but who alone had
the Benefit of it, having gain'd the Time to bring
their Army together, had they made a right U&s;e
<PB N="369" REF="378">
of the Advantage, were now advanced to <HI>Gad&s;|hu&s;ch;</HI>
&s;o that Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> was, as it were,
block'd up in the narrow Di&s;trict of <HI>Wi&s;mar,</HI>
having his Infantry quartered in the very City,
and his Cavalry canton'd in the Villages round;
where had the three Armies joyn'd, they mu&s;t
have fallen all into the Hands of the Allies,
without Fighting, at lea&s;t all the Hor&s;es, the
Country not affording Forrage Sufficient to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t
them.</P>
<P>BUT Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> knew the Enemy he had
to deal with, and gathering his Troops together
in one Days time, the Truce being to end the
very next Day, he put him&s;elf in full March to|wards
<HI>Gadsbusk,</HI> even before the <HI>Danes</HI> had No|tice
of his being &s;tirr'd from <HI>Wi&s;mar;</HI> as the
<HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Armies were near, the King of
<HI>Poland</HI> detached 4000 <HI>Saxon</HI> Hor&s;e to reinforce
the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> as &s;oon as ever he heard
that Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> went that Way, and the <HI>Danes</HI>
ha&s;ten'd them in their way by many Me&s;&s;engers
on the Heels of one another, and at la&s;t by a
Signal of three Pieces of Cannon, which inti|mating
the Extremity, cau&s;ed the <HI>Saxon</HI> Cavalry
to make &s;uch Ha&s;te, that when they arriv'd, be|ing
immediately to go on Action, their Hor&s;e
were &s;o fateigu'd, that they were neither able to
fight, or to run away, and were ea&s;ily defeated,
helping rather, to di&s;courage, than reinforce
the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Army, who they came to &s;erve.</P>
<P>IT was the 20th of <HI>December</HI> when the two
Armies came to engage; a full Account of the
Battle can never be drawn from the Perticulars
which were made Publick at that time, each &s;ide
&s;etting forth their own Ca&s;e with the Boa&s;ts and
Rhodomontadoes, u&s;ual with tho&s;e Nations: But
<PB N="370" REF="379">
in few Words, 'tis evident the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>
was &s;oundly Beaten; his Army being driven out
of the Field; his Maje&s;ty, very little to his Ho|nour,
retiring even before the Battle was entire|ly
lo&s;t; the <HI>Swedes</HI> took all their Cannon and
Baggage, &s;everal Colours and Standards, and near
4000 Pri&s;oners, and the &s;catter'd Remains of their
Army retir'd to <HI>Olde&s;loe,</HI> and afterwards Count
<HI>Steinboch</HI> enter'd into <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> and had not the

by joyning his Forces with the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI>
and per&s;uing the <HI>Swedes,</HI> the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>
had, in all human Probability, been Ruin'd.</P>
<P>THUS his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty has been fir&s;t, or la&s;t,
the Deliverer of all his <HI>Allies,</HI> and the only
Prince that has appear'd able to reduce the
haughty Courage of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Nation; as &s;oon
as his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had an Account of the
Battle, he joyn'd the King of <HI>Polands</HI> Army, and
all together march'd after Count <HI>Steinboch,</HI> who
had already pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Trave,</HI> and was advanc'd
into <HI>Hol&s;tein;</HI> the Remains of the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e
which had e&s;caped the Battle of <HI>Gadsbu&s;ch,</HI>
joyn'd them in their March, being 2700 Men,
and the whole Army was now, by the Con&s;ent
of the two Kings, put under the Command of his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, as Generali&s;&s;imo.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, the <HI>Swedes</HI> went on, they
pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Trave</HI> near <HI>Lubeck,</HI> and Advancing
towards the <HI>Elb,</HI> came to <HI>Hamburgh;</HI> here they
&s;ent out Parties to demand heavy Contribu|tions
of all the Country, and particularly, of the
City of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> it &s;elf; and having enter'd the
King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Territories, they burn'd <HI>Alte|na,</HI>
a rich trading Town, within two Miles of
<HI>H$mburgh:</HI> This they pretended was done in
<PB N="371" REF="380">
Repri&s;al for Towns the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army and other
Confederates had de&s;troy'd in <HI>Pomerania.</HI></P>
<P>THIS barbarous Action, Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> lay'd
to the Charge of General <HI>Welling,</HI> late Governor
of <HI>Bremen;</HI> and in Ju&s;tification, publi&s;h'd the fol|lowing
Letters about it, one whereof pretends
to reproach his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Troops, in their
Treatment of their Ma&s;ters Enemies, perhaps
he intends <HI>Livonia</HI> tho' he names it not; the o|ther,
lays the &s;ame Violent Method to the
Charge of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and their U&s;age of the In|habitants
<HI>O&s;&s;enden</HI> in the Dutchy of <HI>Bremen;</HI>

are as follows.</P>
<P>&startq;THE <HI>Swedes</HI> having continued for &s;ome Days
about <HI>Ode&s;loe</HI> and <HI>Segebergh,</HI> made a Motion to|wards
<HI>Pinenberg,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Ba&s;&s;ewitz</HI> with
200 Hor&s;e came to <HI>Altena,</HI> and requir'd the In|habitants
to pay a great Sum for Contributions.
On <HI>Sunday</HI> in the Afternoon Count <HI>Steinboch</HI>
came to <HI>Hamburgh</HI> with &s;everal Generals and
having had a long Conference with Count <HI>Wel|ling,</HI>
went to joyn his Troops po&s;ted before
<HI>Altena,</HI> which had been reinforced by several
Detatchments. 'Tis &s;aid the <HI>Swedes</HI> demanded
of that Place 200000 Rixdollars, whereupon,
they offer'd 50000, declaring, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible
for them to pay a greater Sum, upon
which the Agreement was broke, and the fol|lowing
Night &s;everal Detatchments march'd
into <HI>Altena,</HI> and &s;et it on Fire, whereby 'tis
computed that about 3000 Hou&s;es were reduc'd
to A&s;hes, together with the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Church; but
<PB N="372" REF="381">
tho&s;e of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> and Reform'd were pre|&s;erv'd,

the <HI>Elbe,</HI> whereby there are a World of People
ruin'd. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Factors who fore&s;aw that

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with great Regret that I have found my &s;elf
con&s;train'd to de&s;troy the Town of <HI>Altena;</HI>
Rea&s;ons of War, and an inde&s;pen&s;able Nece&s;&s;i|ty,
have prevailed over my own Inclination, which is
not to imitate the Enemies confederated again&s;t the
King my Ma&s;ter: I can at lea&s;t a&s;&s;ure your Excellen|cy,
that the Deva&s;tation of &s;everal of his Maje&s;ty's
Provinces, and the Inhumanities committed therein,
will not move me but in the la&s;t Extremities, to re|taliate
the &s;ame on the Subjects of his <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty;
and 'tis with this &s;incere Intention that I
have thought fit, Sir, to recommend to you a Pre|caution
<PB N="373" REF="382">
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be u&s;ed with the Forces
of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, which is to hinder that they
do not leave behind them in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> upon their
marching out of that Country; burning Tokens and
frightful A&s;hes, to mark the Stay they have made
there, as they have done el&s;ewhere; of which the poor
Inhabitants will never lo&s;e the dreadful Remem|brances.</P>
<P>It will be ea&s;y for the King, your Ma&s;ter, for the
good of his own Subjects, to agree about this with his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, or el&s;e it will not be in my Power
to forbear u&s;ing, tho' again&s;t my Will, Repri&s;als in
the Dominions of his <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, and to de&s;troy
therein as many Towns and Villages as the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI>
&s;hall have laid in A&s;hes in <HI>Pomerania</HI> at their De|parture.
<HI>I am,</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>&startq;This is the Account Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> has
given him&s;elf of this Affair, and a Letter
written from his Camp, dated the 8th In|&s;tant,
from <HI>Pinenberg,</HI> gives &s;ome Explanation
of tho&s;e Rea&s;ons of War mention'd by that
General. That Letter is as follows,</P>
<P>COunt <HI>Stienboch</HI> having, receiv'd certain Intelli|gence
in his Camp at <HI>Segeberg,</HI> that they were ma|king
great Magazines at <HI>Altena</HI> to bake Bread and
to brew Drink for the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> which
were expected there, his excellency thought fit to al|ter
his March, and move that Way with his Army,
to de&s;troy, as the Rea&s;ons of War requir'd, tho&s;e pre|judicial
Stores of Provi&s;ions, which by more particu|lar
<PB N="374" REF="383">
Accounts, me knew the whole Town was $word$
with; but Time, (with Re&s;pect to the Approach of
the &s;aid Troops, and the want of Carriages) not
permitting to carry off the &s;aid Provi&s;ions, nor to
de&s;troy them otherwi&s;e than by &s;etting them on Fire,
his Excellency was oblig'd to give Order for the do|ing
it, thereby coming even with the <HI>Danes</HI> in &s;ome
Mea&s;ure, for the di&s;mal and cruel Burning exerci&s;ed
on the good and ancient Town of <HI>Staden.</HI> His Excel|lency
commanded however, that the Inhabitants &s;hould
be allow'd &s;ome Time to &s;ave their Effects, and a|bove
all, the Churches should be re&s;pected and &s;p$r'd,
tho' that ju&s;t Moderation was not ob&s;erv'd by the
<HI>Danes</HI> in the Burning and De&s;truction of <HI>Staden.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> publi&s;h'd a brief&punc;
but bold Manife&s;to on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion: As
follows,</P>
<P>COunt <HI>Magnus Steinboch,</HI> Coun&s;ellor of State
and War, and Commander in Chief of the Ar|my
of his Maje&s;ty the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> notifies and
makes it known, that the Enemies of his Maje&s;ty ha|ving
pre&s;um'd to de&s;troy by Fire the Town of <HI>Staden,</HI>
and the Dutchy of <HI>Bremen,</HI> belonging to the King
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> his Maje&s;ty has commanded him to u&s;e
Repri&s;als, and burn down the Town of <HI>Altena;</HI> de|claring
further, that if the Enemies make any new
Execution by Fire in the Dominions of the King his
Ma&s;ter, he will make u&s;e of all the Severities of
War in the Dutchy of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> and other Coun|tries
belonging to his <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, by Right of
Repri&s;als, as he has done at <HI>Altena.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="384">
BUT the Ravages of the <HI>Swedes</HI> grew near
an End; the <HI>Czar</HI> mov'd a pace with his Ar|my,
joyn'd by the <HI>Saxons,</HI> towards the <HI>Swedes;</HI>
the <HI>Danes</HI> joyn'd his Army in their March, with
what Troops they had, and all together amount|ed
to 36000 Men, which was too many for the
<HI>Swedes</HI> to pretend to grapple with; his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty arrived at <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> the 14th of <HI>Janua|ry,</HI>
attended by Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> and &s;everal
Generals, as well of his own Troops, as of the
<HI>Dane</HI>'s and <HI>Saxon</HI>'s Army, which Coming on by
&s;low Marches, the Weather, and the Ways being
extreamly bad, the Soldiers &s;uffer'd very much
in their March.</P>
<P>WHILE his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty continued in the
Neighbourhood of <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> he cau&s;ed a Day of
Fa&s;ting and Publick Prayers to be proclaim'd in
the united Army, to ask of Heaven Succe&s;s up|on,
their Undertaking, and to add Alms Deeds
to their Devotion, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty cau&s;ed
1000 Rubles in Gold to be di&s;tributed to the poor
Sufferers at <HI>Altena,</HI> and cau&s;ed Propo&s;als, and
Encouragement to be offer'd them, if any of them
thought fit to go Abroad, and would &s;ettle in
any part of his Dominions.</P>
<P>WHILE this was doing, Count <HI>Fleming,</HI> the
<HI>Saxon</HI> General, and General <HI>Scholten</HI> the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI>
V$lt Mari&s;chal, wrot an expo&s;tulatory Letter to

Governor General of the Dutchies of Bremen
and Werden, to Count Flemming, and Mon|&s;ieur
Scholten.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Me&s;&s;ieurs.</OPENER>
<P>SINCE you have done me the Honour to com|municate
to me the letter you have written to
Count <HI>Steinboch,</HI> concerning the Burning of
<HI>Altena,</HI> tho' without mentioning the Magazines that
were therein; &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e you de&s;ign'd thereby to
engage me to explain my &s;elf upon this Matter.</P>
<P>I don't know, Me&s;&s;ieurs, whether the Sight of the
De&s;truction of <HI>Staden</HI> has been more dreadful to you,
than that of the Burning of <HI>Altena;</HI> but it is cer|tain,
that the former might have been avoided, where|as
the latter was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. The Rea&s;ons
that obliged Count <HI>Steinboch,</HI> tho' entirely again&s;t his
Will, to come to &s;uch Extremities, have already been
made Publick. If the red hot Bullets you threw into
<HI>Stral$und</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;inar,</HI> had had their Effect, and
burnt tho&s;e Towns as well as our Magazines therein,
the Rea&s;on of War would have ju&s;tify$d you, as well as
it now does Count <HI>Steinboch.</HI></P>
<P>But the many Flames that have been kindled, and
the dreadful Deva&s;tations of &s;everal of the King my
Ma&s;ter's Dominions, cannot find the &s;ame Ju&s;tifica|tion,
being committed without any manner of Nece&s;&s;i|ty,
by tho&s;e of your Allies, that you even call <HI>Chri|&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dani&s;h Zealand,</HI> and <HI>Saxony,</HI> will always be
an Evidence, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> never had recour&s;e to
Flambeaux, unle&s;s they were forced to the &s;ame, by
Rea&s;ons of War; but that our Nation, always u&s;ed
<PB N="377" REF="386">
to revenge them&s;elves upon their Enemies, by way of
Arms, and of&punc; Humanity, never with Burning, and
exerci&s;ing of Cruelties.</P>
<P>The dreadful Ruins &s;everal of his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje|&s;ty's
Provinces and Towns belonging thereunto, have
&s;uffer'd, and the Chains of Slavery under which a|bove
a hundred Thou&s;and of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s
Subjects, of both Sexes, who have been &s;old to the In|fidels,
groan at this very Time, will, for the good of
your Ma&s;ter's Countries, prevail upon you, to concur
with Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> in making a more humain

<P>I have deliver'd to Colonel <HI>Meyer</HI> the Precau|tion
Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> has recommended to Mon|&s;ieur

not at all doubt, but you will contribute thereto.
Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> has a&s;&s;ur'd me, that for his Part,
he will proceed not to any Extremity again&s;t the
Dutchy of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> unle&s;s he be nece&s;&s;itated to it.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>A LETTER from the Generals
Flamming and Scholten, to General Welling.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY the Letter which you have done us the Ho|nour
to write to us, we have &s;een the Rea&s;ons
which you alledge for the Burning of <HI>Altena.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="387">
We being Parties, will not take upon us to be Judges,
There are enough to decide it. Mean while, you will
allow us to tell you, there is no Compari&s;on between
what has been done at <HI>Altena,</HI> and what happen'd at
<HI>Staden. Staden</HI> is a fortify'd Town, which re&s;i&s;ted
the Arms of his <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty, and again&s;t which,
it was allowable to u&s;e all the Means that are ordi|narily
taken to reduce a Town: But <HI>Altena</HI> is an
open defencele&s;s Place; and we believe, Sir, that a
Parallel can never be made, between a Bombardment
and the &s;etting a Town on Fire with Torches. 'Tis
as if the inevitable Slaughter in a Battle or an A&s;&s;ault,
&s;hould be compared with a Ma&s;&s;acre of People who
do not defend them&s;elves, nor are in a State of De|fence.</P>
<P>The other Rea&s;ons for the Burning of <HI>Altena,</HI>
that have been made Publick, amount to this, that
Magazines were providing, and Bread baking there;
but 'tis certain, there was no Magazines in <HI>Altena,</HI>
or if there were, they were &s;o incon&s;iderable, that
there could be no Pretence on that Account, for
burning above 2000 Hou&s;es, and reducing &s;everal
Thou&s;ands of People to Beggary; and this, without
gaining any Advantage by it. According to this
Allegation that there were Magazines, was not
th$ught of in the An&s;wer which Count <HI>Steinboch</HI>
made to the Deputies of <HI>Altena;</HI> nothing was then
urg'd, but the Affair of <HI>Staden,</HI> to which we think
we have given a &s;ufficient Reply.</P>
<P>As to the Burning Bullets fired into <HI>Stral&s;und</HI>
and <HI>Wi&s;mar,</HI> we refer to what we have &s;aid about
the Bombarding of <HI>Staden.</HI> This is lawful, but
voluntary Burnings are abhorred.</P>
<P>As to the Conduct of our Allies, we &s;uppo&s;e you
will allow a Di&s;tinction between cutrages committed
without Order, and tho&s;e committed by expre&s;s
<PB N="379" REF="388">
Order. Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> him&s;elf made that Di|&s;tinction
very ju&s;tly &s;ome Months ago, when &s;peaking
of &s;ome Di&s;orders done by the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Soldiers,
<HI>he ask'd,</HI> whether they had been order'd to commit
them; and being a&s;&s;ured, that not only &s;uch Orders
had never been given, but that the Authors of tho&s;e
Exce&s;&s;es had been puni&s;h'd; <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> he was glad to
hear it, adding, that he could not treat tho&s;e who
&s;hould commit &s;uch Outrages by Order, and who &s;hould
fall into his Hands, as Pri&s;oners of War, but as In|cendaries.
What you can alledge farther of the Con|duct
of our <HI>Allies,</HI> may be ea&s;ily ju&s;tify'd by the Right
of Reprizals. Remember only, Sir, what was
practi&s;ed on our Side, after the Battle of <HI>Ne$rva.</HI>
Before that Time, had any &s;uch Cruelties been
acted?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who were Authors of the Fir&s;t, are an&s;wer|able
for all that have been committed &s;ince. You
know, Sir, that there is no other Foundation of the
Law of Nations than Agreement and Example.
After the Precedent yo$ have newly &s;et us, it will
be lawful for our Ma&s;ters to retaliate others upon
you, of what kind &s;oever, and this by the Law of
Nations.</P>
<P>In our Opinion the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Moderation in <HI>Zealand</HI>
ought not to be alledged on this Occa&s;ion, for the
King your Ma&s;ter not having landed there as an
Enemy, but as a Guarantee of Peace, could not exerci&s;e
Acts of Ho&s;tility there.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Saxony,</HI> your Intere&s;t had a greater Share
in your Humanity, than Humanity it &s;elf. With the
23 Millions which you drew from <HI>Saxony,</HI> it might
have been re&s;tored to its former State, had it been
all laid in A&s;hes. And how otherwi&s;e could you
have cloathed, recruited and remounted your Army.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="389">
Be this as it will, tho&s;e two Examples prove
however, that Burnings and Acts of Inhuma|nity,
are more authoriz'd by the Mini&s;ters and Ge|nerals
of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> than by that Prince
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>We have reply'd to the Example which you al|ledged
of the Ruin of &s;everal of your Provinces;
but we cannot apprehend what you mean by advi&s;ing
us to concur with Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> in carrying on the
War humanly, after the Example of Inhumanity and
Cruelty, which he has newly given us: A Cruelty,
that has co&s;t the Lives of &s;o many poor Innocents, of
Women in Childbed and in Labour, of Sick who were
not in a Condition to get out of Bed. How many
Children and Aged &s;natch'd from the Violence of
the Flames, were unable to endure the Extremi|ty
of the Cold, and peri&s;hed mi&s;erably in the
Snow?</P>
<P>How many unhappy Wretches of both Sexes and
all Ages, expo&s;ed to the Rigour of the Sea&s;on,
peri&s;h daily of Cold and Hunger? Are the&s;e the
In&s;tances of Humanity which Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> would
have us Imitate? Can we make such a Propo&s;ition
to our Ma&s;ters?</P>
<P>We have &s;een the Letter which Count <HI>Steinboch</HI>
wrote to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Wibe,</HI> we will &s;u&s;pend our Judg|ment
on it; bnt know that Threats work nothing
upon the Per&s;ons who are ju&s;t, and of generous Minds,
&s;uch as are in the Court of the King of <HI>Denmark.</HI>
We conclude, by &s;aying, that you can never ju&s;tify
the Burning of <HI>Altena;</HI> but it will Ju&s;tify all that
we may attempt for taking true Vengeance, if our
Augu&s;t Ma&s;ters, agreeably to their u&s;ual Humanity and
$word$, do not think fit to defer the imitating
&s;o cruel an Example, unle&s;s they are forced to it by
new Cruelties of the like Nature: We are a&s;&s;ured in
<PB N="381" REF="390">
the mean while, that the Almighty mill not let pa&s;ts
without Puni&s;hment, the unheard of Cruelties that
have been practi&s;ed at <HI>Alten.</HI></P>

<P>AFTER all that has been &s;aid, of the Civility
of the <HI>Turks</HI> to the <HI>Czar,</HI> and to his Mini&s;ters,
&s;uch was the uncertainty of Things, on that Side
the World, that in the mid&s;t of the Proceedings of
the <HI>Czar,</HI> in &s;o remote a Part of the World, his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was again allarm'd with the Ru|mour
that his Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Cou&s;tantinople</HI> was a|gain
impri&s;oned in the <HI>Seven Towers,</HI> and that the
<HI>Turks</HI> had declared War again again&s;t him; and
he was earne&s;tly pre&s;s'd by his Generals to leave
this Petty Retail War, (<HI>as they called it</HI>) and ad|vance
to the Frontiers of <HI>Tartary,</HI> to prepare to
oppo&s;e the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER as his Maje&s;ty had better Intelli|gence
than his Enemies in the <HI>Ottoman Port,</HI> he
was always appriz'd of things as they really were
reported to be, and knew very well how far they
were True, and how far not. The <HI>Turks</HI> were
for awhile much influenc'd by the Han of <HI>Tartary,</HI>
and the Creatures of the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> 'twas a
little hard that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;hould be able
to bribe the <HI>Turks</HI> with their own Money, and
di&s;tribute the &s;ame Sums, which the <HI>Port</HI> gave
him for his Support, to the great Officers of the
&s;ame <HI>Port,</HI> to engage them to break Faith with
the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> after he had perform'd all
that was required by their la&s;t Treaty; had re|&s;tor'd
<PB N="382" REF="391">
<HI>A&s;oph,</HI> had di&s;mantled <HI>Ka&s;&s;irkameen,</HI> and
the other Places, and fully withdrawn his Troops
out of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Czar</HI> was too many for them here too,
for his Mini&s;ters at the <HI>Port</HI> having Power given
them to enter upon a new Treaty, and the
<HI>Czar</HI> cau&s;ing about 70000 Men to advance to the
Frontiers of <HI>Moldavia,</HI> to let the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;ee he
was not unprovided; the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Mini&s;ters found
it much ea&s;ier to reconcile Matters with the <HI>Port,</HI>
than was imagin'd, and the old League was not
only renew'd for 30 Years, but other Terms were
gain'd, which made as much for his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje|&s;ty's
Intere&s;t as could be de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>ALL this while his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty was at the
Head of the Confederate Army in <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> pu&s;h|ing
the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army under Count <HI>Steinboch;</HI> his
Maje&s;ty had, indeed, determin'd to leave the
Army, and return to his own Dominions, and
the rather, becau&s;e of the Mi&s;chief which he knew
was breeding at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> by the Intreagues
of the King of <HI>Sweden;</HI> but knowing the Mi&s;un|under&s;tandings
in the Confederate Army
would be &s;uch, about the Command, that there
would be no Agreement; and it being hard, that
the Army, two Thirds of which were at the &s;ame
Time his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's own Forces, &s;hould be
Commanded by any but his own Generals; up|on
this Con&s;ideration, he re&s;olv'd to manage
the other Part by Negotiation, and to Command
the Army in <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE Confederates were, as things then &s;tood,
much too &s;trong for Count <HI>Steinboch;</HI> their Force
was above 36000 Men, the <HI>Swedes</HI> nor above
14000 at be&s;t, but led by an old Fox that knew
his Advantages, and how to lay hold of them, to
<PB N="383" REF="392">
a Tittle; that knew how to fight when he had a
feir Field, and how to avoid it, when he was out
Number'd and not in Condition.</P>
<P>THIS, Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> &s;eeing the Confederates
advance, and that they were too powerful for
him, march'd from <HI>Altena,</HI> North into <HI>Upper Hol|&s;tein,</HI>
and advancing along the <HI>Eyder&s;torm,</HI> kept the
Confederates at Bay a great while, about <HI>Fred|rick&s;tand,</HI>
near which Place they pa&s;s'd the &s;aid
River <HI>Eyder,</HI> and advanc'd to <HI>Oerfield,</HI> and to
<HI>Hu&s;um:</HI> Here they laid the Country under Con|tribution,
and rai&s;ed a very great Sum in Mo|ney,
and Provi&s;ions: Here Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> po&s;t|ed
him&s;elf to &s;o much Advantage among the Ri|vers
and Dikes, that it was not ea&s;y to attack
him.</P>
<P>BUT his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd to make
&s;hort Work with him, and in a Word, to attack
him, where-ever he could find him, co&s;t what it
would; for as I noted above, the <HI>Czar</HI> at this
Time, was pre&s;s'd by his own Affairs, not know|ing
whether his Affairs with the <HI>Turks</HI> would
End in Peace or War; Orders were therefore gi|ven
to make Di&s;po&s;itions for the Attack, while
the <HI>Swedes</HI> on the other Hand, fortify'd their
Camp, and made an Appearance of Re&s;i&s;tance,
threatening to give the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> a very warm Re|ception.
But Count <HI>Steinboch,</HI> after repul&s;ing our
Men at the Attack of one of his Po&s;ts, where the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> had &s;ome Lo&s;s, thought fit
not to &s;tand the Shock of a general Attack by
the whole Army; and accordingly, quitted the
advantagious Camp, and retired to another, and
thus retiring from one Po&s;t to another, and the
Confederates &s;till following him Clo&s;e, and pu&s;h|ing
<PB N="384" REF="393">
him from Place to Place, he begun to be
brought to Extremity.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t Account of the&s;e &s;everal Motions
leave them very uncertain, and are &s;carce worth
our collecting; the &s;hort of the Matter is, that
the Confederates attack'd the <HI>Swedes</HI> at <HI>Holling|&s;tede,</HI>
but were repul&s;ed with the Lo&s;s of 300
Men; and the next Night the <HI>Swedes</HI> retired, and
po&s;ted their whole Army in a very &s;trong Situa|tion,
between <HI>Fredrick&s;tadt,</HI> and the Fortre&s;s of
<HI>Toningen.</HI> This la&s;t was a very &s;trong Place, be|longing
to the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> and Garri&s;on'd
by his Troops, who being in <HI>Sweden,</HI> a Youth,
and under Age, the Admini&s;tration of his E&s;tates,
was left to the Care of his Uncle, the Prince
and Bi&s;hop of <HI>E$tin.</HI></P>
<P>THE Governor of this Fortre&s;s made Show of
keeping an exact Neutrality; and once, when
Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> &s;ent a Letter to him, &s;ent it un|open'd,
refu&s;ing to receive any Letter or Me&s;&s;a|ges
on either Side; and while Matters &s;tood thus,
Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> &s;tood but in very ill Terms,
being &s;treighten'd for Room, and al&s;o for Provi|&s;ions,
and almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the Confedorate
Armies, who were &s;o much &s;uperior.</P>
<P>IN this Po&s;ture the Confederates pre&s;s'd him
very hard; and tho' he avoided Fighting, and
retir'd from one Po&s;t to another, yet it was
apparent he mu&s;t at la&s;t Fight to his inevi|table
De&s;truction, or &s;u$$ender to his Ene|m$es.</P>
<P>HE defended him&s;elf, however, in this Man|ner
a long time, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Beginning of
<HI>January,</HI> till the 14th of <HI>February,</HI> 1712$ 13. In
vain pr$$ing the Governor of <HI>Tonnighen</HI> to give
him a Retreat into the Fortre&s;s, and being
<PB N="385" REF="394">
pu&s;h'd to Extremity by the Confederates, he
came with the whole <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army and encamp|ed
at <HI>Gardenghen,</HI> a Village, within half a League
of <HI>Toningen.</HI></P>
<P>THE Confederates follow'd him Clo&s;e, and
here the Governor of <HI>Toningmen,</HI> whether by
Order of the Prince Admini&s;trator of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> or
by Stratagem of Count <HI>Steinboch,</HI> is very little
known to this Day: But the Governor, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI>
let the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General, and with him, his whole
Army, into the Place, to the great Relief and
Encouragement of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> who were, indeed,
brought to the Point of being ruin'd.</P>
<P>THIS was a Blow to the Confederates who had
been extreamly fateigu'd with the Service they
had been upon, having kept in the Field all the
<HI>Winter:</HI> The Matter was now come to a Point,
there was now no way left now to force them,
and nothing but a very clo&s;e Blockade, could
Effect their Reduction, and this the Army a|greed
on.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> finding now that the Thing would
be drawn out in Length, left the Army and went
to <HI>Hamburgh;</HI> and from thence, to <HI>Hanover.</HI> His
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty left the Army the 15th of <HI>Fe|bruary,</HI>
having fir&s;t had a long Conference with
the Kings of <HI>Denmark,</HI> where the Command of
the Army was &s;ettled, and the Rank of the
Troops, and every thing needful to carry on the
De&s;ign; for having Count <HI>Steinboch</HI> and the
<HI>Swedes</HI> in &s;o clo&s;e a Place, it was certain, they
ought not to let them go off, co&s;t what it would.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> having now left the Army, had &s;e|veral
private Affairs in Hand, as particularly, at
<HI>Wolfembotle,</HI> where he made &s;ome Stay, in order to
reconcile things between the Prince&s;s of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI>
<PB N="386" REF="395">
his Daughter-in-Law, and her Husband, the
<HI>Czarowitz,</HI> or Hereditary Prince, who, it &s;eems
had had &s;ome Difference with the Prince&s;s, his
Spou&s;e, of which we &s;hall hear farther.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Wolfenbuttel,</HI> the <HI>Czar</HI> went to <HI>Magde|burg,</HI>
and thence to <HI>Schoonho&s;en</HI> near <HI>Berlin,</HI> where
he had an Interview with the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI>
and where his <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian</HI> Maje&s;ty entertain'd him
with the utmo&s;t Magnificence. This was the
10th of <HI>March,</HI> the next Day, the two illu&s;trious
Monarchs dined together; and the <HI>Czar</HI> having
abu$dance of Rea&s;on to be very well &s;atisfy'd
with his Reception, parted the &s;ame Afternoon
for <HI>Dantzick</HI> in his way to <HI>Livonia.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT was made Publick at this Time of his
<HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Journey, &s;eems to have Truth
in it, being writen from <HI>Dantzick,</HI> after the <HI>Czar</HI>'s
Arrival there as follows, <HI>viz</HI></P>
<P>THE Court of <HI>Wolfenbuttel</HI> is highly &s;atisfy'd
with the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and the Prince&s;s, Wife
to the Hereditary Prince, &s;et out the 16th of
<HI>March</HI> under the Di&s;charge of the Cannon for
<HI>Petersburg</HI> by the way of <HI>Berlin</HI> and <HI>Dantzick.</HI>
The <HI>Czar</HI> pre&s;ented her with a great Sum of Mo|ney
for the Charges of her Journey; and at the
&s;ame time a&s;&s;ur'd her, that &s;he &s;hould be u&s;ed
with &s;o much Re&s;pect in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> that he did not
que&s;tion but &s;he would ea&s;ily forget <HI>Germany.</HI>
That Prince made con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents to the
Mother of that Prince&s;s, and among&s;t other
Things, pre&s;ented her with his Picture &s;et with
Diamonds, of a con&s;iderable Value. The Court
of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> is to continue at <HI>Petersburg</HI> for &s;ome
Time, and &s;ome Grandees of the Retinue of the

that Place the Seat of his Empire, and 20000

which are to be man'd and fitted out at <HI>Copen|hagen,</HI>
to act in Conjunction with the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI>

<HI>Cruitz.</HI> Thus far this Account.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e things were doing, the <HI>Czar</HI>'s
Troops kept their Footing in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and a
great Part of the Town of <HI>Wolga&s;t</HI> refusing to
pay their Contributions, was burnt by the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> General's Order. But the Attack of
<HI>Stral&s;und</HI> or <HI>Stetin,</HI> was not thought proper to be
undertaken 'till the <HI>Swedes</HI> in <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> were en|tirely
reduc'd, which were yet a Work of Diffi|culty.</P>
<P>THIS Year his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Queen, or
rather Empre&s;s, tho' they call'd her in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>
by neither of tho&s;e Stiles, but that of <HI>Czarina,</HI>
was deliver'd of a Daughter, or Prince&s;s; this
happen'd very much to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Sa|tisfaction,
ju&s;t after his Arrival at <HI>Petersburg.</HI>
This Prince&s;s was baptized a few Days after, ac|cording
to the Rites of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, and
named, <HI>Maria Petra Witza.</HI></P>
<P>ALL this while the Preparations again&s;t the

them&s;elves with Hopes of taking him at the &s;ame
Advantage they did before, <HI>viz.</HI> to be &s;urround|ed

to &s;upply the Army, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> of take from his

Banks of the <HI>Dnie&s;ter,</HI> and two Bridges of Com|munication
to be laid over the River; and here
he laid up, and re&s;olv'd to lay up Stores of Corn,
and Forrage, with Meal, and an infinite Quanti|ty
of other Provi&s;ions, &s;ufficient for his whole
Army; re&s;olving al&s;o, if he advanc'd into <HI>Mol|davia,</HI>
to build two &s;trong Forts; one at an impor|tant
Pa&s;s, in the Way to the <HI>Pruth;</HI> and another,

contributed not a little to cool their

Capitulate; &s;everal Treaties and Offers had been

once taken, the Ea&s;tern <HI>Bothina</HI> would fall of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>IT was for this Rea&s;on, that his Maje&s;ty pre|par'd
&s;o con&s;iderable a Force for this Conque&s;t.
The <HI>Czar</HI> &s;ail'd the 19th from <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> with
with a Fleet of 20 Men of War 100 Gallies, and
200 Tran&s;port Ships, having on Board 18000 Foot,
with a Train of Artillery, as well of heavy Can|non
and Mortars, as of Field peices with a great
Magazine of all &s;orts of Stores of War directing,
his Cour&s;e &s;trait for <HI>Abo</HI> in <HI>Finland;</HI> the Cavalry,
con&s;i&s;ting of 9000 Hor&s;e, and Dragoons were or|der'd
to march by Land to meet the Army at
their coming on Shoar: The Hereditary Prince of
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> al&s;o attended his Father the <HI>Czar</HI> in this
Expedition.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty went on this attempt, as
to a certain Conque&s;t, for the Affairs of the <HI>Swedes</HI>
were at this time at &s;o low an Ebb, and the Nation
of <HI>Swedland</HI> under &s;uch di&s;couragements, that they
were in no Condition to repul&s;e him, or defend
them&s;elves; he therefore carried with him a Mani|fe&s;to
to be publi&s;hed at his Landing, to a&s;&s;ure the
Inhabitants, prevent their flying from their Ha|bitations,
and promi&s;ing them all po&s;&s;ible good
U&s;age, and that the Army &s;hould not Plunder,
but ob&s;erve good Di&s;cipline, and pay punctally
<PB N="395" REF="404">
for all the Provi&s;ions they took of them over and
above the ordinary Contributions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not to be wondered at, if this Expedition
put the whole Kingdom of <HI>Swedeland</HI> into a ter|rible
Con&s;ternation, for &s;eeing the great Prepa|ration
making for a De&s;cent, and &s;o great an Army
embark'd, the Senate and Governors of <HI>Swedeland</HI>
made no Que&s;tion, but that it was de&s;igned again&s;t
the Capital of the Kingdom, and Con&s;equently
was a blow at the Root in order to &s;ubvert the
whole Government, and make an entire Conque&s;t
of <HI>Sweden</HI> it &s;elf, which as things then &s;tood, had
been no difficult thing for his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty to
have done: This alarm however, they had really
no Cau&s;e, for yet the Fright, had this good Effect,
that the Governor of <HI>Sweden</HI> drawing all the
&s;trength of the Kingdom together for the Defence
of the Coa&s;t about <HI>Stockholm,</HI> and the Coa&s;t of we&s;t
<HI>Gothia,</HI> between <HI>Stockholm</HI> and <HI>Um,</HI> and between
<HI>Stockholm</HI> and <HI>Carel&s;croon;</HI> &s;o they left the Province,
and Coa&s;t of <HI>Finland,</HI> whether the true de&s;ign of
the <HI>Czar</HI> was pointed quite unguarded, and in a
manner neglected, not that they forgot the need|ful
Care of it, but that being anxious to pre&s;erve
the Heart, or Main of the Kingdom of <HI>Sweden,</HI> they
had not Troops to &s;pare for the &s;uccour of the re|moter
Provinces, where the Danger indeed only
lay.</P>
<P>THIS gave his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty an ea&s;ie Con|que&s;t
of <HI>Finland,</HI> where he Landed his Army
without any con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition: He Landed
at <HI>He&s;ingsford,</HI> a &s;mall Port Town, which the <HI>Swe|di&s;h</HI>
Garri&s;on not being in Condition to defend,
&s;et on fire, and retired towards <HI>Abbo,</HI> where the
<HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General <HI>Arenfield,</HI> who had the com|mand
of the Troops left for the Defence of that
<PB N="396" REF="405">
Province, drew all his Forces together to make
Head again&s;t the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> and had advanc'd to
<HI>Borgo,</HI> a &s;trong Pa&s;s, which he pretended to de|fend;
but we &s;hall afterwards &s;ee how well they
maintain'd them&s;elves there.</P>
<P>IN the mean time we mu&s;t ca&s;t back our Eyes
to Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> and the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army in their
Victorious return from the Country of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI>
their demand upon the City of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> has been
mention'd; the Conclu&s;ion of which was, that
the <HI>Hamburghers</HI> Paid the Prince 200000 Rixdol|lars,
and &s;o the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army quitted their Di|&s;trict;
the like Preten&s;ions the Prince made upon
the Citizens of <HI>Lubeck,</HI> and got 100000 Marks
of them, and then without any &s;top they ad|vanc'd
towards <HI>Pomerania;</HI> it was propos'd to at|tack
<HI>Wi&s;mar,</HI> and the <HI>Danes</HI> provided a great
Train of Artillery for that Purpo&s;e; but the Ge|nerals
differing afterwards upon particular Diffi|culties
in the Enterprize it was laid a&s;ide, and the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army march'd and joyn'd the re&s;t of their
Troops in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> where being together, they
made up an Army of 36000 Men, with which
Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> re&s;olv'd to attack the City of
<HI>Stetin,</HI> the Capital of the Royal <HI>Pomerania.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a City of great &s;trength, and the Works
were in very good Condition, and con&s;idering
the gallant Defence this City made when be&s;ieged
by the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia's</HI> Father, then Elector of
<HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> again&s;t whom it defended it &s;elf to
the la&s;t Extremity; I &s;ay, con&s;idering this, it was
e&s;teem'd a de&s;perate Undertaking of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI>
General, and the World expected it would be the
ruin of their Army, and the di&s;grace of the Gene|ral;
but this did not Di&s;courage Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI>
who about eight Days after he had Inve&s;ted the
<PB N="397" REF="406">
Place, rais'd a Battery again&s;t the <HI>Oder</HI> Fort, a
&s;trong Work, which guarded the Bridge, and af|ter
having Batter'd it two Nights, caus'd it to be
&s;torm'd, which his Men did with &s;uch Fury,
that the <HI>Swedes,</HI> which defended it, being not able
to maintain their Ground, the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> entered
Sword in Hand, the Defendants being all cut in
pieces, except a very few, who had Quarter grant|ed
them: This gave the Courage of the Citizens
a &s;hock, and it was ea&s;ie to &s;ee they had not the
Gallantry and Re&s;olution of their Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>WHILE this was doing, the <HI>Saxons</HI> who lay at
<HI>Damin</HI> and at <HI>Grip&s;wald,</HI> found means with the
help of &s;ome <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Fregates, and &s;ome other
Ve&s;&s;els to Land upon the I&s;le of <HI>Rugen,</HI> the <HI>Swe|di&s;h</HI>
General <HI>Ducker,</HI> who commanded in the
I&s;land, having but very few Troops retired to a
&s;trong Pa&s;s in the way to <HI>Stral&s;und,</HI> and made a
&s;tand there, but kept his Retreat open to <HI>Stral&s;und,</HI>
if need were, and the <HI>Saxons</HI> receiving &s;ome Re|inforcements
from <HI>Gry&s;waldt</HI> advanced towards
him, on which being in no Condition to maintain
the Po&s;t, he retir'd to <HI>Stral&s;und,</HI> and left the
<HI>Saxons</HI> Ma&s;ters of the whole I&s;land; and now the
King of <HI>Denmark</HI> repented heartily that he had
not caus'd his Army to advance into <HI>Pomeren,</HI> for
now had been the Time to have attack'd the City
of <HI>Strael&s;und,</HI> in which there was not a &s;ufficient
Garri&s;on, or Provi&s;ions to have held out a Siege,
nor any Relief at Hand, the Affairs of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
being as I have &s;aid in great Confu&s;ion; the King's
Si&s;ter, &s;ince Queen of <HI>Sweden,</HI> being about that
time about taking upon her the Regency of the
Kingdom in the Ab&s;ence of the King.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="407">
THE <HI>Saxons</HI> were &s;en&s;ible of the Advantage they
had, but they wanted every thing needful for &s;uch
a Seige as that of <HI>Strael&s;und;</HI> however they &s;at
down before the Place, inve&s;ted it, and &s;urpriz'd
400 Hor&s;es, and 50 di&s;mounted Troopers, in the
Enclo&s;ures near the City, and di&s;patch'd Expre&s;&s;es
to <HI>Denmark</HI> for Cannon and Ammunition, which
came not in time, as you &s;hall hear, which occa|&s;ion'd
the Seige to be deferr'd till new Laurels
were prepar'd by the&s;e things for his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Ma|je&s;ty.</P>
<P>THERE happen'd at this very time a Di&s;covery
of the villainous De&s;ign again&s;t the Life of the
King of <HI>Poland,</HI> which made a very great Noi&s;e,
and oblig'd Count <HI>Flemning</HI> to go away imme|diately,
and the <HI>Saxon</HI> Troops were order'd to
draw off from the intended attack of <HI>Strael&s;und,</HI>
and follow with all &s;peed the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> ex|pecting
a General Revolt, e&s;pecially on the Side
of <HI>Lithuania;</HI> but his <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty manag'd his
Affairs with &s;uch Dexterity that nothing of that
kind happen'd.</P>
<P>THE attack of <HI>Stetin</HI> was al&s;o deferr'd for the
pre&s;ent, but the City was clo&s;ely block'd up, and
the Blockade &s;o well concerted, that the Navigati|on
of the <HI>Oder</HI> was cut off from the <HI>Stetiners,</HI>
which was indeed the only Means to reduce
them.</P>
<P>THE Enemies of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Glory had now the

his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty and the <HI>Turks</HI> confirm'd, by in|telligence

<P>THE publi&s;hing of the&s;e Articles, &s;topp'd the
Mouths of tho&s;e People who in&s;ulted the <HI>Czar,</HI>
with having &s;ubmitted for fear of a War with
the <HI>Turks,</HI> to be Tributary to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> as for|merly
the <HI>Czars</HI> had been, but as his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty had always rejected the Articles with
Scorn, &s;o it was now apparent that the <HI>Turks</HI> had
dropp'd it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army lay all this while before <HI>Ste|tin,</HI>
&s;ometimes re&s;olving to be&s;iege it in Form, and
then, at other times to blockade it; but now Prince
<HI>Menzikoff</HI> being returned from <HI>Berlin,</HI> where a
Treaty for Seque&s;tring the Town into the Hands of
the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> had been &s;et on Foot, but came
to nothing. <HI>I &s;$y,</HI> the Prince being Return'd,
re&s;olv'd upon a Bombardment, which he knew
would either bring the City to &s;urrender, or the
King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> to yield to the Seque&s;tration upon
the Terms propos'd, which was to pay to the <HI>Czar</HI>
of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> 600000 Rix Dollars for the Charges
of the Siege.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the&s;e Re&s;olutions, our Trenches
were open'd, and advanc'd to proper places; and
the Batteries rai&s;ed with the utmo&s;t Expedition,
<PB N="401" REF="410">
the Artillery con&s;i&s;ted of 58 Pieces of heavy
Cannon, and 32 Mortars: On the 20th of <HI>Sep|tmber,</HI>
all our Batteries of Cannon and Mor|tars
being in a Readine&s;s, it was re&s;olv'd to
Fire upon the Place the 28th in the Morn|ing.
All the Drums and Houtboys of the Ar|my
were order'd to meet in the Trenches about
9 of the Clock, where they play'd about an Hour,
to the great Surprize of the Be&s;ieged, who appear'd
on their Walls to &s;ee what the meaning of it
could be; but about Ten, we began to fire from
all our Batteries at once, and continu'd till the
Evening; which had &s;uch an Effect, that the
Inhabitants &s;eeing about 160 of their be&s;t Hou&s;es
burnt, and their Churches batter'd down, they
oblig'd General <HI>Meyrfelt</HI> to de&s;ire a Ce&s;&s;ation of
Arms. The Sieurs <HI>Ba&s;&s;ewitz</HI> and <HI>Brukenthal</HI> were
&s;ent into the Place, and told the Governor that the
Ho&s;tilities &s;hould be di&s;continu'd for &s;even Hours
only, and that he might take his Mea&s;ures there|upon.
Tho&s;e Gentlemen reported, that the
Burghers refu&s;ed to take up Arms, and the Regi|ment
of <HI>Pomerania</HI> expre&s;&s;ing an Inclination to
lay them down. General <HI>Meyrfelt</HI> offer'd to march
out with his Garri&s;on in 5 Days, provided they
would give him leave to &s;end an Expre&s;s to Count
<HI>Welling,</HI> to acquaint him there with; which was
granted him, upon Condition that a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
Officer &s;hould go along with the Per&s;on he would
&s;end to the Count afore&s;aid, and that his Letter
to him &s;hould not be &s;eal'd. This being agreed
to, the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Officer and the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> &s;et out the
&s;ame Morning very early or <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> and we
hop'd in a few Days to be Ma&s;ters of this important
Fortre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="411">
BUT while the Garri&s;on of <HI>Stetin</HI> were thus,
at the Extremity, another Medium was found
out, which made all Sides ea&s;y, and this was the
Treaty of Seque&s;tration, <HI>mention'd above.</HI> This
was ab&s;olutely, nece&s;&s;ary for Prince <HI>Menzkioff</HI> to
yield to; or, to break with the <HI>Danes,</HI> and the
King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> al&s;o; for the former, prote&s;ted
ab&s;olutely again&s;t <HI>Stetin</HI> being put into the Hands
of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;ingly, and in&s;i&s;ted that there
&s;hould be a Quota of <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> Troops put
into Garri&s;on there, as well as <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> which
Prince <HI>Menzicoff</HI> rejected; tho&s;e Powers having
not contributed one Farthing towards the Siege.</P>
<P>IN a Word the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> &s;ending a very
obliging An&s;wer to the la&s;t Offers of the Prince,
was in Return invited to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Camp, where
his <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian</HI> Maje&s;ty arriv'd the 5th of <HI>October,</HI>
at ended with 3000 Dragoons and 9000 <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian</HI>
Foot, being on the other Side the <HI>Oder,</HI> where they
encamp'd. His <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian</HI> Maje&s;ty was very Magni|ficently
entertain'd by Prince <HI>Menzicoff,</HI> and a
Royal Tent &s;et up, in which his Maje&s;ty lodg'd;
the 6th at Night, having been &s;hewn all the Ap|proaches
of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Army, their Batteries, and
the Preparations which the Ingineers had made for
&s;torming the Place, and that we were &s;ure of our
Game.</P>
<P>THE next Day the Seque&s;tration was &s;ettled
and agreed upon, and the Garri&s;on and Burghers of
<HI>Stetin,</HI> agreeing al&s;o that the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> &s;hould
march into the City the 7th at the Head of 1600
Dragoons, his Infantry entering the Town by the
<HI>Oder</HI> Bridge the next Day.</P>
<P>BY this Treaty, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Stetin</HI> was to
remain a-like to the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and the Duke
of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> till the Peace, and 1600 Men of the
<PB N="403" REF="412">
Troops of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> were allow'd to remain in Gar|ri&s;on
with 1600 <HI>Pui&s;&s;ians;</HI> and the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI>
paid Prince <HI>Menzikoff</HI> 500000 Rix Dollars, and &s;o
this trouble&s;ome Affair ended.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here, that both the <HI>Saxons</HI>
and <HI>Danes</HI> took great offence at this Treaty; for
the Seque&s;tration of <HI>Stetin</HI> was not Communicated
to them, the <HI>Saxons</HI> alledg'd, &s;eeing the Cannon
furni&s;hed for the Siege belong'd to their King, his
<HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty ought to &s;hare the Money, and de|manded
one half of the 500000 Dollars; but Prince
<HI>Menzikoff</HI> gave them good Words, and kept all
the Money.</P>
<P>THE King of <HI>Denmark</HI> took the Allarm,
there being a Report &s;pread that another Treaty
was al&s;o on Foot for the Seque&s;tration of <HI>Wi&s;mar</HI>
and <HI>Stral&s;und,</HI> upon which the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ter
pre&s;ented a Memorial in his Ma&s;ter's Name, to
the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> intimating
that his Ma&s;ter had been very much &s;urprized to
hear&punc; that an Affair of &s;o much Importance as the
Seque&s;tration of <HI>Stetin</HI> had been concluded, and
that Place deliver'd to the Troops of the Duke of
<HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> who&s;e Intere&s;t is in&s;eparable from that
of <HI>Sweden;</HI> That his Maje&s;ty hopes nothing &s;hall
be concluded without his Participation in relation
to <HI>Wi&s;mar,</HI> becau&s;e of his particular Concerns in
that Affair, and that the whole Matter, which has
been hitherto kept Secret from him, &s;hall be fairly
communicated to his Maje&s;ty, and in the mean
time the &s;aid Mini&s;ter has thought fit to prote&s;t
again&s;t whatever has been done in this Seque&s;tra|tion
without his Con&s;ent and Knowledge.</P>
<P>As to the Treaty for the Seque&s;tration of <HI>Wi&s;|mar</HI>
and <HI>Stral&s;und,</HI> it came to nothing; and all things
being now over, the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Army, which was
<PB N="404" REF="413">
by this Time reduced by hard Service without
any con&s;iderable Action to 22000 Men from
36000; they began their March out of the Coun|try,
the 25th of <HI>September,</HI> according to the Capi|tulation
of which, that was one of the mo&s;t par|ticular
Conditions.</P>
<P>WHILE this was done, the Armies of his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty were Victorious in <HI>Finland;</HI> General <HI>Le|becker</HI>
had been recall'd from that Government,
and General <HI>Arenfield</HI> &s;ent in his Room, as is no|ted
above; but he had no better luck than the
other, for being encamped at a very advantagious
Po&s;t, with 7000 <HI>Swedes,</HI> regular and old Troops, and
18000 Men, new rai&s;ed, but well arm'd, and un|der
very good Officers, yet the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> attack'd
them; the new rai&s;ed Troops being undi&s;ciplin'd,
yet made very great Re&s;i&s;tance at fir&s;t, but were
charg'd with &s;uch Fury, that they were at length
defeated; which occa&s;ion'd that the 7000 <HI>Swedes</HI>
were &s;urrounded, and after a very good Defence,
were almo&s;t all cut in Pieces, or taken Pri&s;oners,
with all their Artillery, and Baggage.</P>
<P>AFTER this Action, the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Troops enter'd
<HI>Abo</HI> without Re&s;i&s;tance, and his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
re&s;olv'd to batter down the Defences of the other
two Forts, which lye adjoyning to the Sea, and
which interrupted his Progre&s;s; and thus he
became Ma&s;ter of the whole Province, with the
Lo&s;s of very few Men, and the Tranquility of
the Country w$s re&s;tor'd entirely: As the <HI>Czar</HI>
had gain'd this whole Province &s;o ea$ily, he was
re&s;olv'd it &s;hould not be &s;o ea&s;ily taken from him;
he therefore went to Work immediately, to forti|fy
the Towns of mo&s;t Importance, as <HI>Abo</HI> and
<HI>Hel&s;ingvos,</HI> and others, both which, he has &s;ince
made very &s;trong.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="414">
THIS Action with the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Troops under
General <HI>Ahrenfield,</HI> having been diver&s;ly reported,
and the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> being charged with Partiallity, in
relating their own Affairs; I &s;hall therefore give
here a Copy of General <HI>Ahrenfields</HI> own Ac|count,
which tho' he makes the be&s;t of his Lo&s;s
to &s;ave his own Character; yet an impartial Rea|der
will ea&s;ily perceive, a Total defeat was given
him, and that he has lo&s;t not only his Army, but
the whole Province; &s;o that our Account will be
effectually ackowledg'd by the Enemy, which is the
be&s;t kind of Confirmation; his Letter is as follows:</P>
<P>THIS will inform, that we &s;u&s;tained Ye&s;terday a
fierce Attack from the Enemy, who, at la&s;t, oblig'd
us to give Ground. Our Intrenchments near <HI>Palka|na</HI>
were very &s;trong, and we reckon'd to be able to
de$end 'em a great while again&s;t con&s;iderable Forces:
But, contrary to our Expectation, the Enemy found
Means to land 7000 Men within a quarter of a
League behind us. I had made &s;everal Detachments, and
&s;ent our Parties to get Intelligence, by which I learnt,
that &s;everal of the Enemy's Boats were in &s;ight;
whereupon I made all the nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;po&s;itions to
hinder a De&s;cent; I al&s;o view'd the Place where the
Enemy de&s;ign'd to land, and caus'd &s;ame Hor&s;e to be
po&s;ted there. I had be&s;ides this, drawn two thirds of
the Infantry, that were within the Lines, in order
likewi&s;e to oppo&s;e the De&s;cent; but the Wind, which
had been contrary to the Enemy's de&s;ign all Night,
turn'd favourable to them at Break of Day; be&s;ides
which, there was a thick Fog, that we could not per|ceive
till they advanc'd upon us. Our Cavalry was
<PB N="406" REF="415">
at fir&s;t oblig'd to retire, becau&s;e the Infantry I had
drawn from our Line could not came up time enough
to &s;u&s;tain them; the Enemy before their approach,
having landed the be&s;t part of their Troops. Never|thele&s;s,
we advanc'd and charg'd them with a great deal
of Bravery, and by our &s;uperior Fire, pu&s;h'd them into
the Water; but they being &s;upported by &s;uch as hourly
landed on all &s;ides, we were obliged to give way in our
Turn. We had di&s;po&s;ed things in &s;uch a manner, that the
Hor&s;e was to attack the Enemy in Flank, and if they
had perform'd their Duty, 'tis probable we &s;hould have
had Succe&s;s: But tho' the Foot did all that could be
expected from the be&s;t Troops, yet we could never
prevail with the Cavalry to do the like, each
Plattoon giving way one after another. Things
being at this Pa&s;s, it was not difficult for the
Emnemy to attack our Lines; however, they lo&s;t abun|dance
of Men, till upon certain Con&s;iderations, I
order'd the Troops to abandon the Intrenchments.
The Lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;tain'd in tho&s;e Attacks is not
&s;mall. We were oblig'd to march through the mo&s;t con|venient
Places to favour our Retreat, and the Infantry
being obliged to take &s;everal Routs, it is not yet po&s;&s;ible
for me to know what Number of Men are mi&s;&s;ing. In
mean time, I have again po&s;ted my &s;elf in this Pa&s;&s;age,
in order to make all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;i&s;tance. The great
Number of Roads and Pa&s;&s;ages had oblig'd me to
divide my Troops in &s;uch manner, that I had only
with me 700 Hor&s;e and 1100 Foot to oppo&s;e the
landing. This Day the Enemy advanc'd near this
Place, and I am now in Expectation of their further
Undertakings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE Truth of this Matter was thus, that Gene|ral
<HI>Ahrenfield</HI> was entirely defeated, his Hor&s;e
which indeed did not do their Duty were never
<PB N="407" REF="416">
heard of, till they were effectually &s;ecured at a|bout
60 Miles retreat North, and the General
with that &s;mall Remnant of his Infantry, which,
out of 25000 Men, did not amount to above 8000,
5133 being kill'd in the Action, and 512 taken
Pri&s;oners, quitted the whole Province, and made
long Marches, tho' none pur&s;ued them into <HI>Lap|land,</HI>
whence we heard of them no more; but
&s;uppo&s;e they got Boats to carry them over the
Gulph of <HI>Bothnia</HI> into <HI>Swedeland,</HI> where they were
at that time in Confu&s;ion enough.</P>
<P>THE Conque&s;t of this Province has been of great
advantage to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Affairs, for he
was now &s;ufficiently &s;eparated from <HI>Sweden,</HI> and
under no Obligation to maintain a great Number
of Troops upon his Frontier, as before the keep|ing
of good Garri&s;ons in <HI>Abo</HI> and <HI>Hel&s;ingford,</HI>
Places which he has made very &s;trong, and
keeping a Number of Gallies always ready up|on
that Coa&s;t, is &s;ufficient to keep all quiet on
that Side.</P>
<P>FROM hence al&s;o his Maje&s;ty had drawn a va&s;t
Number of good Soldiers, the <HI>Finlanders</HI> being al|ways
e&s;teem'd the be&s;t Men in the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Ar|mies,
and e&s;pecially for Hor&s;e, it being a Coun|try
for breeding of Hor&s;es, the Men are naturally
good Hor&s;e-men, and yet I under&s;tand that his
Maje&s;ty has not Levy'd any Men there, but &s;uch
as voluntarily Li&s;ted into his Service.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> had now fini&s;h'd the Conque&s;t of
the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Territories, as far as they lay con|tiguous
to his own; nothing could more be at|tempted
again&s;t the <HI>Swedes,</HI> but by Naval Pre|parations
for a De&s;cent on the Kingdom of <HI>Swe|den</HI>
it &s;elf. His <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had, as I have
mentioned already, very much improv'd his
<PB N="408" REF="417">
Marine Affairs, as well as his Millitary Affairs
by Land, but not to &s;uch Perfection, for his Land
Forces were brought to a Perfection not to be
que&s;tion'd; his Troops were able to grapple with
any of the Forces of his Neighbours Man for Man,
nay, he has often beaten the <HI>Swedes</HI> when they
have been &s;uperior in Number, and in the la&s;t
Action at the Siege of <HI>Stetin,</HI> where there were
no Troops but <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> it appear'd how well they
did their Bu&s;ine&s;s; how regularly they carry'd
on their Approaches; how boldly they &s;torm'd;
how firmly they &s;u&s;tain'd the Sallies of the
<HI>Swedes;</HI> and how artfully they mannag'd the De|fence
of their Trenches. We &s;hall now &s;ee &s;ome
Proceedings in which their naval Force was al|ways
concern'd.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty who knew the Di&s;po&s;ition
of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as well as any Man;
knew there was no &s;itting &s;till while he was in
being; and the only way to reduce him to Rea|&s;on,
was, to pu&s;h his Kingdom of <HI>Sweden</HI> to the
utmo&s;t Extremity, while he was Ab&s;ent; if po&s;&s;i|ble,
to bring the Regency, newly e&s;tabli&s;h'd
there, in the Prince&s;s <HI>Ulrica Eleonora,</HI> and the
Senate, to the Nece&s;&s;ity of making a Peace,
before the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> return'd from <HI>Turkey.</HI></P>
<P>To this Purpo&s;e, the <HI>Czar</HI> cau&s;ed a Project
to be laid before the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> for a &s;e|cond
and more effectual Invading of <HI>Schomen,</HI> an
Undertaking, which he knew very well, would
be very ageeable to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who
having receiv'd a terrible Di&s;grace in his former
Attempt there, at the Battle of <HI>El&s;enburg,</HI> would
be very willing to retrieve that Blow, and al&s;o
pu&s;h the <HI>Swedes;</HI> he having likewi&s;e pu&s;h'd the
War on this &s;ide the <HI>Sound,</HI> to the utmo&s;t, and
<PB N="409" REF="418">
compleated the the Conque&s;t of <HI>Hol&s;tein, Bre|men,</HI>
and <HI>Verden;</HI> nothing remaining to the
<HI>Swedes</HI> on this &s;ide the whole <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, but
<HI>Pomeren,</HI> and the City of <HI>Wi&s;mar;</HI> which were at
that time under a kind of Offer to be Seque|&s;trated
to the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> tho' afterwards
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> forbid it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> did not re|ceive
this Propo&s;al at fir&s;t, in &s;uch a manner
as the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> expected; and much
Time was &s;pent in debating upon the particu|lar
Branches of the Undertaking, and the Quo|tas,
and Expences nece&s;&s;ary to be furni&s;hed.
But at length his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty who knew this
was the only way by which the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
could be effectualy humbled, conquered all his
<HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Objections, and offer'd &s;uch A&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
as well of Land Forces, as of Shiping,
that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> &s;aw an evident Oppor|tunity
put into his Hands, for recovering that
Part of the old Kingdom of <HI>Denmark,</HI> which his
Ance&s;tors had lo&s;t to the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and which was
given up by the Treaty of <HI>Ro&s;child,</HI> viz. <HI>Scho|nen,
Bleaking,</HI> and <HI>Halland,</HI> Provinces extended
on the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Sound</HI> and the <HI>North Sea,</HI> from
<HI>Malmo</HI> to <HI>Gottenbro',</HI> and which lye in the very
Sight of his Pallace in <HI>Copenhagen.</HI></P>
<P>AS the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> began at la&s;t to li|&s;ten
to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's offer; &s;o Troops were
prepar'd, order'd to march into <HI>Pomeren,</HI> and <HI>Meck|lemburgh,</HI>
to be tran&s;ported from thence to <HI>Copen|hagen,</HI>
and in a Word, his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty made
&s;uch Preparations both by Land, and Sea, as con|vinc'd
the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> that he &s;hould be put
into a Po&s;ture to humble <HI>Sweden</HI> effectually, and this
brought him to come heartily into the thing, tho'
<PB N="410" REF="419">
as it appear'd the Circum&s;tances of <HI>Denmark,</HI> were
not at that time equal to the Undertaking.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty &s;tuck at no|thing
in Rea&s;on to animate the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI>
to per&s;ecute the War with a&s;uitable vigour, 300000
Rixdollars were remitted to <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> and
200000 more afterwards to encourage the King of
<HI>Denmark</HI> to ha&s;ten out his Fleet to Sea, and in the
mean time the <HI>Czar</HI> fitted out his own Fleet, con|&s;i&s;ting
of 30 Men of War, mo&s;t of them being
brought and fitted up in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and
having embark'd 24000 Men on Board, they &s;ail'd
for the I&s;le of <HI>Aland,</HI> where his Maje&s;ty attack'd Ad|miral
<HI>Ehren&s;child,</HI> and took his Ship, and &s;ix Gal|lies,
killed 327 Men, and took about 936 Pri&s;o|ners,
and landed 16000 Men in that I&s;land$; which
put the whole Kingdom of <HI>Sweden</HI> into the mo&s;t
terrible Surprize, and Con&s;ternation imaginable,
the I&s;le of <HI>Aland,</HI> being as it were at the Mouth
of the River of <HI>Stockholm.</HI></P>
<P>BUT all this while the <HI>Danes</HI> did nothing, not|with&s;tanding
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty had
&s;ent them, they pretended indeed to fit out their
Ships and joyn the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Fleet, but they were &s;o
long in doing it, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> was at Sea, and
rendezvous'd at the I&s;le of <HI>Bournholm</HI> before the
<HI>Danes</HI> were in Condition to act; &s;o that the expected
Conjunction was prevented, which indeed was the
Di&s;appointment of all farther Opperations for that
Summer.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Czar</HI> &s;eeing how little &s;uch Allies were
to be depended upon, put off his intended De&s;cent
upon <HI>Sweden,</HI> for the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Fleet was &s;o &s;trong,
being 20 Men of War, and &s;ome of their Men of
War &s;o large, for they had four or five three Deck
Ships from 84 to 106 Guns, and his Maje&s;ty's
<PB N="411" REF="420">
Fleet, tho' well appointed, yet con&s;i&s;ted chiefly
of Ships, bought in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> mo&s;t
of them being from 44 to 60 Guns, three Ships or
four of his Maje&s;ty's own building might be there
of 70 and 80 Guns, But was not advi&s;eable to
come to a general Engagement with the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
without the Conjunction of the <HI>Danes.</HI></P>
<P>IT is to be remembered here, that his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty having for &s;ome Years, when he fir&s;t ap|plyed
his Thoughts to encrea&s;e his Naval &s;trength,
had his Eyes and all his Mea&s;ures employ'd up|on
building a Royal Navy for the Service of the
<HI>Black-Sea,</HI> &s;o he had now brought that Work to &s;uch
perfection, that he had a Fleet at <HI>Veronowitz,</HI> on
the <HI>Tanais,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of 44 Ships, from 50 to 90
Guns, whereof 16 of them carried from 80 to 90
Guns; all which Preparations were intirely lo&s;t,
and rendered u&s;ele&s;s, by the &s;urrender of <HI>A&s;oph,</HI>
given back in Con&s;equence of the unhappy Cam|paign
in <HI>Moldavia</HI> a, s a above.</P>
<P>BUT the opening a Navigation into the <HI>Bal|tick,</HI>
by the taking the once impregnable Ca&s;tle of
<HI>Notteburgh;</HI> the making a Harbour and Port at
<HI>Croon&s;lot,</HI> and building the Imperial City of <HI>Pe|tersburgh,</HI>
which we find at the writing this Hi&s;to|ry
to be rais'd in about 22 Years from a vacant
piece of Ground, to a City of 50000 Hou&s;es be|&s;ides
publick Edifices, all the&s;e were at the time
of this taking of the I&s;land of <HI>Aland,</HI> but new
things, and therefore, tho' the Progre&s;s the <HI>Czar</HI>
had made, was for the time &s;urpri&s;ing to the World,
yet his Naval &s;trength was young, his Subjects
not yet enur'd to Sea-Service; and he was too wary
a Prince to put the Succe&s;s of all his great De|&s;igns
upon, the hazard of a general Engagement
<PB N="412" REF="421">
&s;o early, and as it were in the beginning of things;
and for this Rea&s;on he withdrew from the I&s;land
of <HI>Aland,</HI> upon the Di&s;appointment of the <HI>Danes,</HI>
and gave over his Enterprize for that Year.</P>
<P>SINCE this, we have found his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
has improv'd his <HI>Marine</HI> &s;trength to &s;nch a degree,
and furni&s;h'd him&s;elf with &s;uch Capital Ships of
his own building, that now he is a Match for the
<HI>Swedes,</HI> and the <HI>Danes</HI> put together, and when|ever
tho&s;e Powers apprehend his coming to attack
them, thy are oblig'd to get the aid of a Squa|dron
of Men of War from <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to their
A&s;&s;$&s;tance, or rather as it may ju&s;tly be call'd for
their Protection.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the <HI>Danes;</HI> the King of
<HI>Denmark,</HI> began now to be&s;en&s;ible of his Mi&s;take,
and of his having lo&s;t the Opportunity for the
humbling his Enemy the <HI>Swede;</HI> and now to re|trieve
it we find, that the <HI>Czar</HI> pre&s;s'd him to en|gag
in a new Scheme for the &s;aid &s;econd Inva&s;ion
of <HI>Schonen,</HI> and offer'd him his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as well
by Sea as Land; al&s;o &s;eeing how &s;ucce&s;sfully
the <HI>Czar</HI> went on, and how it might be probable
that at one time or other, the <HI>Czar,</HI> by his Supe|rior
&s;trength would break in upon the <HI>Swedes</HI>
without him, and then he might lo&s;e the Oppor|tunity,
and have no &s;hare at all of the Advan|tage:
This turned the Scale at the Court of
<HI>Denmark;</HI> and as the <HI>Czar</HI> pre&s;s'd him before, as I
have &s;aid to engage in &s;uch an Attempt, and
promis'd $o A&s;&s;$&s;t and Support him; &s;o now he, his
<HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty pre&s;s'd the <HI>Czar</HI> as much to come
into that Scheme, as if it had been contriv'd at
<HI>Copenhagen</HI> and not at <HI>Petersburgh.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="422">
IN the mean time, the <HI>Czar,</HI> as I have &s;aid,
withdrew from <HI>Aland;</HI> and having order'd his
Gallies and light Fregates to carry the Land
Forces to <HI>Abo</HI> in <HI>Finland,</HI> he &s;ail'd with the Gro&s;s
of his Fleet, and the Ships, he had taken from the
<HI>Swedes</HI> to <HI>Petersburgh,</HI> where he made his publick
Entry, with almo&s;t as much Triumph as he did for+merly
at <HI>Mu&s;cow,</HI> after the Victory at <HI>Pultowa.</HI></P>
<P>AND his Maje&s;ty did this the rather, becau&s;e
it was the fir&s;t Snow of that kind, which had ever
been made in his new City; and becau&s;e it was a
heartening, and Encouragement to his Seamen, to
merit by their Bravery, and to other of his Sub|jects
to enter into the Sea-Service, which they might
&s;ee had &s;uch Honours, and Triumphs attending it.
The Sum of which is as follows: As to a particular

Rear-Admiral <HI>Ehren&s;child</HI> &s;at at Table be|tween
his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty and Prince <HI>Menzi|koff;</HI>
and during the Entertainment the <HI>Czar</HI>
took the Opportunity to compliment that Ad|miral
on his brave Defence in the Fight, a&s;&s;ur|ing
him &s;everal times of his particular E&s;teem
and Affection, and that he would take care to
make him as ea&s;y as the could under his Mis|fortune.
The other <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Officers &s;at at ano|ther
Table, and were u&s;ed with all po&s;&s;ible Civi|lities,
and &s;o ended that great Solemnity.</ITEM>

<P><PB N="416" REF="425">
THERE was al&s;o a very Magnificent Fire-work
appointed to be performed or play'd off, at the
Gate of the Royal Palace. But the Engineers
repre&s;enting that they had not compleated the
De&s;ign, and could not be ready under three or
four Days, it was play'd off the <HI>Sunday</HI> after,
when his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty went publickly to the
great Church, to give Thanks for the Succe&s;s of
his Arms; and it was admirably perform'd,
without the lea&s;t Di&s;order or Mi&s;take.</P>
<P>IT is to be noted, That this was not a Triumph
for the bare taking of one Ship and &s;ome Gallies
from the <HI>Swedes</HI> at the I&s;le of <HI>Aland;</HI> but it was
upon a Conclu&s;ion of a long Series of Victories
obtain'd over the <HI>Swedes;</HI> and indeed, fini&s;hing
the Conque&s;t of all the Dominions which the
<HI>Swedes</HI> had po&s;&s;e&s;s'd on the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Sides
of the <HI>Baltick Seas,</HI> viz. the whole Province of
<HI>Livonia;</HI> of <HI>Ea&s;thonia,</HI> and of <HI>Carelia;</HI> and <HI>In|garmania;</HI>
the Town and Port of <HI>Narva;</HI> the
City of <HI>Stetin;</HI> the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Notteburg;</HI> the
City of <HI>Wyburgh;</HI> the I&s;le of <HI>Aland;</HI> and the
whole Country of <HI>Finland,</HI> a Province of it|&s;elf,
large enough, to be call'd a Kingdom,
and &s;eated upon the Sea Coa&s;t, for 300 Miles
in Length, where it is to be noted that the
&s;trong Ca&s;tle of <HI>Hel&s;ingvos,</HI> the la&s;t and only Place
which the <HI>Swedes</HI> held in that Province, was
taken at the relanding of the Army there; &s;o
that the whole Country was &s;ubdu'd, and the
<HI>Swedes</HI> put into a terrible Fright, even in the
Heart of <HI>Sweden.</HI> Nay, a Body of <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> had
tran&s;p$$ted them&s;elves over the <HI>Bothnick</HI> Gulph,
and had landed on the Main of Old <HI>Sweden</HI>
it &s;elf, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> in the Province of <HI>We&s;t Both|nia,</HI>
<PB N="417" REF="426">
where they had ravaged the Country,
burnt &s;everal con&s;iderable Towns and Villages,
where they had taken <HI>Uma</HI> the Capital of that Part
of the Country, and burnt it to the Ground;
after which, they extended Northwards to <HI>Torne,</HI>
and de&s;troy'd the Iron Works, which are very
Con&s;iderable that Way; and did incredible
Damage. Another Body of their Troops, ad|vanced
from <HI>Finland, North,</HI> into the Country of
<HI>Ea&s;t Bothnia,</HI> where the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> General <HI>Ahren|field</HI>
Commanded, and endeavour'd to fight him;
but he not daring to come to Action, retir'd North|ward,
into a remote and inacce&s;&s;ible, and indeed,
barren and uninhabited Country, where it was
not practicable to follow him, leaving the Coun|try
of <HI>Ea&s;t Bothnea</HI> open to the Spoil.</P>
<P>THESE things merrited a Triumph, as much
as the <HI>Roman</HI> Generals merited a Triumph for
the Conque&s;t of the mo&s;t powerful Nations they
&s;ubdued.</P>
<P>BUT to come to the Progre&s;s of the War
again, the <HI>Winter</HI> was no more pa&s;t in Idle|ne&s;s
than the <HI>Summer;</HI> and the <HI>Czar</HI> an active
and re&s;tle&s;s Genius, in all his great Underta|kings,
kept his Enemies the <HI>Swedes</HI> in Continu|al
Allarms, with the Rumour of an Attempt pro|jected
to pa&s;s the <HI>Bothnick</HI> Gulph in the Time
of Fro&s;t, with his whole Army over the Ice;
tho&s;e who know the Country, and tho&s;e Seas,
know very well, that as the <HI>Bothnick</HI> Sea is not
deep, and con&s;equently not agitated much
by Storms, and al&s;o, that there is very lit|tle
Tide, or Current there, it is the &s;oone&s;t
Frozen of any part of the <HI>Baltick Sea;</HI> and
then, as its Scituation is more Northerly than
<PB N="418" REF="427">
any other part of the <HI>Baltick,</HI> lying extended
to the 64th Degree of <HI>North</HI> Latitude; and
it thereby infinitely colder than the re&s;t, &s;o
it is no &s;trange thing to find that Sea like
one &s;olid Rock of Ice, for four or five Months
together, and the Country People travel|ling
over it them&s;elves, pa&s;&s;ing and re-pa&s;|&s;ing
as &s;ecurely as on dry Land, from the
one <HI>Bothnea</HI> to the other: Hence it was no
improbable thing, that the <HI>Czar</HI> might, if his
Views had been that Way, have marched with
his whole Army over that Sea, not excluding his
Baggage, Cannon, and Waggons.</P>
<P>BUT tho' his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty thought fit to
allarm the <HI>Swedes</HI> with the daily Apprehen|&s;ions
of &s;uch an Attempt; yet, this was really
none of his pre&s;ent View: However, it had
this Effect, it continually harra&s;s'd the <HI>Swedish</HI>
Army, in Marching, and counter Marching,
as their own Fears directed them; nay, it went
farther, for as the <HI>Swedes</HI> had tran&s;ported two
&s;everal Bodies of their regular Troops to the
I&s;le of <HI>R$gen</HI> and <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and a thind to
<HI>Wi&s;ma$;</HI> So that General <HI>Ducker</HI> who command|ed
there, threatned to take the Field, and ad|vance
into <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> and <HI>Jutland,</HI> as Count
<HI>Steinboch</HI> had done, having this Advantage in
&s;uch an Enterprize, <HI>viz.</HI> that he had no Army
of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Saxons</HI> to follow him in the
Rear. The Allarm given to the <HI>Swedes</HI> in their
own Country, by his <HI>$zari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty hovering
over their Coa&s;t, as above, had obliged them to
&s;end for 7000 Men back again from <HI>Pomeren,</HI>
to reinforce their Army at Home, and to de|fend
the Capital of their Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="419" REF="428">
THUS the <HI>Danes,</HI> were deliver'd at once by
the powerful Fleet of the <HI>Czar,</HI> from an Ene|my,
which they dreaded in <HI>Hol&s;tein;</HI> and from
a War that would have perhaps been too heavy
for them, as well for the power of their Ene|mies,
as the Expence of it; for the <HI>Swedes</HI> would
at lea&s;t have ruin'd all the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Dominions on
the <HI>Terra firm,</HI> by the Contributions they would
have drawn from thence, and the Ravages of
the open Country, from whence the capital City
is furni&s;h'd with daily Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>THIS very View gave the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>
an an additional Vigour in his new De&s;ign of
invading <HI>$word$,</HI> nothing could more effectually
deliver him from the ju&s;t Apprehensions of a
Vi&s;it from <HI>Pomerania,</HI> as a De&s;cent upon <HI>Schonen,</HI>
carrying the War home into the Heart of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
and finding the <HI>Swedes</HI> Employment to defend
their own Towns, in&s;tead of giving them Lei&s;ure
to meditate the Inva&s;ion of tho&s;e Abroad.</P>
<P>THIS Winter the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> came from
<HI>Turkey,</HI> and arriv'd Incognito at the City of <HI>Stral&s;und</HI>
in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and the World had great Expectations,
that his coming there would give a new Turn to
the Affairs of <HI>Europe;</HI> but that Prince, who&s;e po&s;itive
Temper, aver&s;e to the Advice of his be&s;t Friends,
pu&s;h'd him upon the mo&s;t de&s;perate, and incon|&s;i&s;tent
Actions, quickly made all his Neighbours
ea&s;ie, as to their Appren&s;ions of his Power, for
embroiling him&s;elf with the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and the
Elector of <HI>Hanover,</HI> &s;ince King of <HI>England;</HI> he fi|nish$d
his own Ruin by ab&s;olutely refu&s;ing the mo&s;t
honourable Propo&s;al for Peace that could be made
to him, and engaging him&s;elf in a new War to his
Ruin, for he was finally be&s;iged both by Sea and
<PB N="420" REF="429">
Land, in his City of <HI>Stral&s;und,</HI> and at la&s;t forc'd
to make his E&s;cape in a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el by Sea,
which landed him in <HI>Sweden,</HI> leaving behind him all
his Dominions, and all his hopes in the Empire
of <HI>Germany,</HI> in which he never &s;et his Foot af|terwards.</P>
<P>AND here nece&s;&s;ity, and the &s;welling of the&s;e
Pages beyond Expectation too far, obliges us to
break of the Hi&s;tory. From this Period a new
Scene of War was drawn out, in which the <HI>Czar</HI>
of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> had not only a great Share, but
which ended infinitely to his Glory, and the
Security of his Allies. The <HI>Swedes</HI> were pu&s;h'd
at their own Doors; their Country invad|ed;
the rich Copper Works, and Iron Works,
on which the Commerce of their Nation de|pended,
were ruined; and to fini&s;h all, their
invulnerable Monarch, <HI>as they thought him to be,</HI>
was Slain; their Trea&s;ure exhau&s;ted, and they
were at la&s;t obliged to yield to their Misfor|tunes,
and make a Peace inexpre&s;&s;ibly di&s;ad|vantagious
to them&s;elves, and in Proportion
glorious to his <HI>Czari&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty; all which Acti|ons
remain to be Recorded, and are &s;ufficient
to make another Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>MAY &s;ome other Pen be honoured with the
Narration, that the Glories of our Augu&s;t Em|peror
of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> may be handed to Po&s;terity, in
a manner &s;uitable to his Fame; and to the
Merit of the greate&s;t Prince in all the Ea&s;tern
Part of the World. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
