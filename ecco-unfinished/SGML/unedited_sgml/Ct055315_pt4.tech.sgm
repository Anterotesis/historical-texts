&sect; I. HAVING thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI.</NOTE> to the be&s;t of our power, given
a faithful and exact detail of every material
event in which Great Britain was concerned either at
home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1756.</NOTE> or in her &s;ettlements abroad, during the greate&s;t
part of the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;ix,
we &s;hall now return to Europe, and endeavour to explain
the beginning of a bloody war in Germany, which then
&s;eemed to have become the chief object of the Briti&s;h coun|cils.
On the eve of a rupture between France and Eng|land,
it was natural for his B&mdash;M&mdash;to provide for
the &s;afety of his e&mdash;I d&mdash;s, the only quarter by
which he was at all acce&s;&s;ible to the efforts of the enemy,
who he fore&s;aw would not fail to annoy him through that
avenue. He at that time &s;tood upon indifferent terms with
the K&mdash;of P&mdash;, who was con&s;idered as a parti&s;an and
ally of France; and he knew that the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria
alone would not be &s;ufficient to &s;upport him again&s;t two
&s;uch powerful antagoni&s;ts. In this emergency he had re|cour&s;e
to the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, who, in con&s;equence of
a large &s;ub&s;idy granted by England, engaged to furni&s;h a
&s;trong body of forces for the defence of H&mdash;r. His
P&mdash;n Maje&s;ty, &s;tartled at the conditions of this treaty,
took an opportunity to declare that he would not &s;uffer
foreign forces of any nation to enter the empire, either as
principals or auxiliaries: a declaration which probably
flowed from a jealou&s;y and aver&s;ion he had conceived to the
court of Peter&s;burgh, as well as from a re&s;olution he had
formed of &s;triking &s;ome great &s;troke in Germany, without
any ri&s;que of being re&s;tricted or controlled. He knew he
&s;hould give umbrage to the French King, who had already
made preparations for penetrating into We&s;tphalia: but
he took it for granted he &s;hould be able to exchange his
connections with France for an alliance with Great Bri|tain,
which would be much le&s;s trouble&s;ome, and much
more productive of advantage: indeed, &s;uch an alliance
was the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of his declaration. Had
his B&mdash;ck M&mdash;y made a requi&s;ition of the Ru&s;&s;ian
auxiliaries, he mu&s;t have expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the re&s;entment
<PB N="4" REF="6">
of a warlike monarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III.</NOTE> who hovered on the &s;kirts of his
electorate at the head of one hundred and forty thou&s;and
men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1756.</NOTE> and could have &s;ubdued the whole country in one
week; and if he forbore to avail him&s;elf of the treaty with
the Czarina, he did not know how &s;oon the K&mdash;g of
P&mdash;a might be reconciled to his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's
de&s;ign of inva&s;ion. As for the Empre&s;s-Queen, her atten|tion
was engro&s;&s;ed by &s;chemes for her intere&s;t or pre&s;erva|tion;
and her hands &s;o full, that &s;he either could not or
would not fulfil the engagements &s;he had contracted with
her former and firme&s;t allies. In the&s;e circum&s;tances the
K&mdash;g of E&mdash;d fought and obtained the alliance of
P&mdash;a, which, to the be&s;t of our comprehen&s;ion, en|tailed
upon G&mdash;B&mdash;the enormous burthen of ex|travagant
&s;ub&s;idies, together with the intolerable expen&s;e
of a continental war, without being productive of one ad|vantage
either po&s;itive or negative to E&mdash;d or H&mdash;r.
On the contrary, this connection threw the Empre&s;s-Queen
into the arms of France, who&s;e friend&s;hip &s;he
bought at the expen&s;e of the Barrier in the Netherlands,
acquired with in$inite labour, by the blood and trea&s;ure of
the maritime powers: it gave birth to a confederacy of
de&s;potic princes; &s;u$$icient, if their joint force was fully
exerted, to overthrow the liberties of all the free &s;tates in
Europe; and, after all, H&mdash;r has been over-run, and
&s;ubdued by the enemy; and the K&mdash;g of P&mdash;a put
to the ban of the Empire. All the&s;e con&s;equences are,
we apprehend, fairly deducible from the re&s;olution which
his P&mdash;n M&mdash;y took, at this juncture, to precipitate
a war with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The apparent motives
that prompted him to this mea&s;ure we &s;hall pre&s;ently ex|plain.
In the mean time, the defen&s;ive treaty between
the Empre&s;s-Queen and France was no &s;ooner rati$ied,
than the Czarina was invited to accede to the alliance,
and a private mini&s;ter &s;ent from Paris to Peter&s;burgh, to
negociate the conditions of this acce&s;&s;ion, which the Em|pre&s;s
of Ru&s;&s;ia accordingly embraced: a circum&s;tance
&s;o agreeable to the court of Ver&s;ailles, that the Marquis
<PB N="5" REF="7">
de L'Hopital was immediately appointed amba&s;&s;ador ex|traordinary
and plenipotentiary to the court of Ru&s;&s;ia.
Applications were likewi&s;e made to the courts of Madrid
and Turin, &s;olliciting their concurrence; but their Catho|lick
and Sardinian Maje&s;ties wi&s;ely re&s;olved to ob&s;erve a
neutrality. At the &s;ame time intrigues were begun by
the French emi&s;&s;aries in the &s;enate of Sweden, in order to
kindle up a war between that nation and Pru&s;&s;ia; and
their endeavours &s;ucceeded in the &s;equel, even contrary to
the inclination of their &s;overeign. At pre&s;ent a plot was
di&s;covered for altering the form of government, by in|crea&s;ing
the power of the crown; and &s;everal per&s;ons of
rank being convicted upon trial, were beheaded as prin|cipals
in this con&s;piracy. Although it did not appear that
the King or Queen was at all concerned in the &s;cheme,
his Swedi&s;h Maje&s;ty thought him&s;elf &s;o hardly treated by
the Diet, that he threatened to re&s;ign his royalty, and re|tire
into his own hereditary dominions. This de&s;ign was
extremely di&s;agreeable to the people in general, who
e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e in oppo&s;ition to the Diet, by whom
they conceived them&s;elves more oppre&s;&s;ed than they &s;hould
have been under an unlimited monarchy.</P>
<P>&sect; II. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, alarmed at the&s;e formidable
alliances, ordered all his forces to be completed, and held
in readine&s;s to march at the fir&s;t notice; and a report was
indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated, that by a &s;ecret article in the late
treaty between France and the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, the&s;e
two powers had obliged them&s;elves to de&s;troy the prote&s;|tant
religion, and overturn the freedom of the Empire, by
a forced election of a King of the Romans. The cry of
religion was no impolitick mea&s;ure; but it no longer pro|duced
the &s;ame e$$ects as in times pa&s;t. Religion was made
a pretence on both &s;ides: for the partizans of the Empre&s;s-Queen
in&s;inuated, on all occa&s;ions, that the ruin of the ca|tholick
faith in Germany was the principal object of the
new alliance between the Kings of Great Britain and
Pru&s;&s;ia. It was in con&s;equence of &s;uch &s;ugge&s;tions, that
his Britannick Maje&s;ty ordered his electoral mini&s;ter at
<PB N="6" REF="8">
the Diet to deliver a memorial to all the mini&s;ters at Rati&s;|bon,
expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urpri&s;e to find the treaty he had con|cluded
with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia indu&s;triou&s;ly repre&s;ented
as a ground of apprehen&s;ion and umbrage, e&s;pecially for
religion. He ob&s;erved, that as France had made open di&s;|po&s;itions
for invading the electorate of Hanover, and di&s;|turbing
the peace of the Empire; that as he had been
denied, by the Empre&s;s-Queen, the &s;uccours &s;tipulated in
treaties of alliance; and as he was refu&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tance by
certain &s;tates of the Empire, who even &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to
favour &s;uch a diver&s;ion; he had, in order to provide for
the &s;ecurity of his own dominions, to e&s;tabli&s;h peace and
tranquillity in the Empire, and maintain its &s;y&s;tem and
privileges, without any prejudice to religion, concluded a
defen&s;ive treaty with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia: that, by this
in&s;tance of patriotic zeal for the welfare of Germany, he
had done an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the Empre&s;s-Queen, and
performed the part which the head of the Empire, in
dignity and duty, ought to have acted: that time would
demon&s;trate how little it was the intere&s;t of the Empre&s;s-Queen
to engage in a &s;trict alliance with a foreign power,
which, for upwards of two centuries, had ravaged the
principal provinces of the Empire, maintained repeated
wars again&s;t the archducal hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and always
endeavoured, as it &s;uited her views, to excite di&s;tru&s;t and
di&s;&s;ention among the princes and &s;tates that compo&s;e the
Germanick body.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The court of Vienna formed two con&s;iderable
armies in Bohemia and Moravia; yet pretended that they
had nothing in view but &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and &s;olemnly
di&s;claimed both the &s;ecret article, and the de&s;ign which
had been laid to their charge. His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;|ty
declared, by his mini&s;ter at Berlin, that he had no other
intention but to maintain the public tranquillity of Eu|rope;
and this being the &s;ole end of all his mea&s;ures, he
beheld with &s;urpri&s;e the preparations and armaments of
certain potentates: that, whatever might be the view with
which they were made, he was di&s;po&s;ed to make u&s;e of the
<PB N="7" REF="9">
power which God had put into his hands, not only to
maintain the public peace of Europe again&s;t all who
&s;hould attempt to di&s;turb it, but al&s;o to employ all his
forces, agreeably to his engagements, for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
his ally, in ca&s;e her dominions &s;hould be attacked: finally,
that he would act in the &s;ame manner in behalf of all the
other powers with whom he was in alliance. This inti|mation
made very little impre&s;&s;ion upon the King of Pru&s;|&s;ia,
who had already formed his plan, and was determined
to execute his purpo&s;e. What his original plan might have
been, we &s;hall not pretend to di&s;clo&s;e; nor do we believe
he imparted it to any confident or ally. It mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed,
however, that the intrigues of the court of Vienna
furni&s;hed him with a &s;pecious pretence for drawing the
&s;word, and commencing ho&s;tilities. The Empre&s;s-Queen
had &s;ome rea&s;on to be jealous of &s;uch a formidable neigh|bour.
She remembered his irruption into Bohemia, in the
year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-four, at a time
when &s;he thought that country, and all her other domi|nions,
&s;ecure from his inva&s;ion by the treaty of Bre&s;lau,
which &s;he had in no particular contravened. She caballed
again&s;t him in different courts of Europe: &s;he concluded
a treaty with the Czarina, which, though &s;eemingly de|fen&s;ive,
implied an intention of making conque&s;ts upon
this monarch: &s;he endeavoured to engage the King of
Poland, Elector of Saxony, as a contracting power in this
con$ederacy; and, if he had not been afraid of a &s;udden
vi&s;it from his neighbour of l'ru&s;&s;ia, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed
but he would have been plea&s;ed to contribute to the humi|liation
of a prince who had once before, without the lea&s;t
provocation, driven him from his dominions, taken po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of his capital, routed his troops, and obliged him to
pay a million of crowns, to indemnify him for the expen&s;e
of this expedition: but he carefully avoided taking &s;uch a
&s;tep as might expo&s;e him to another inva&s;ion, and even re|fu&s;ed
to accede to the treaty of Peter&s;burgh, though it was
expre&s;sly defen&s;ive; the <HI>Ca&s;us Foederis</HI> being his Pru&s;&s;ian
Maje&s;ty's attacking either of the contracting pa$ties. It
<PB N="8" REF="10">
appears, however, that Count de Bruhl, prime mini|&s;ter
and favourite of the King of Poland, had, in con|junction
with &s;ome of the Au&s;trian mini&s;ters, carried on
certain &s;candalous intrigues, in order to embroil the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia with the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, between
whom a mi&s;under&s;tanding had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty perceiving the military pre|parations
of the court of Vienna, and having obtained in|telligence
of their &s;ecret negociations with different pow|ers
in Europe, ordered M. de Klingraafe, his mini&s;ter at
the Imperial court, to demand whether all tho&s;e prepa|rations
of war, on the frontiers of Sile&s;ia, were de&s;igned
again&s;t him, and what were the intentions of her Imperial
Maje&s;ty? To this demand the Empre&s;s replied, That in
the pre&s;ent juncture &s;he had found it nece&s;&s;ary to make
armaments, as well for her own defence as for that of her
allies; but that they did not tend to the prejudice of any
per&s;on or &s;tate whatever. The King, far from being
&s;atisfied with this general an&s;wer, &s;ent fre&s;h orders to
Klingraafe, to repre&s;ent, That after the King had di&s;|&s;embled,
as long as he thought con&s;i&s;tent with his &s;afety
and honour, the bad de&s;igns imputed to the Empre&s;s would
not &s;uffer him longer to di&s;gui&s;e his &s;entiments; that he
was acquainted with the offen&s;ive projects which the two
courts had formed at Peter&s;burgh; that he knew they had
engaged to attack him &s;uddenly with an army of two
hundred thou&s;and men; a de&s;ign which would have been
executed in the &s;pring of the year, had not the Ru&s;&s;ian
forces wanted recruits, their fleet mariners, and Livonia
a &s;ufficient quantity of corn for their &s;upport; that he con|&s;tituted
the Empre&s;s arbiter of peace or war: if &s;he de&s;ired
the former, he required a clear and formal declaration, or
po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance, that &s;he had no intention to attack him,
either this year or the next; but he &s;hould look upon an
ambiguous an&s;wer as a declaration of war; and he called
heaven to witne&s;s, that the Empre&s;s alone would be guilty
of the innocent blood that &s;hould be &s;pilt, and all the
<PB N="9" REF="11">
di&s;mal con&s;equences that would atten the commi&s;&s;ion of
ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>&sect; V. A declaration of this nature might have provoked
a le&s;s haughty court than that of Vienna, and, indeed,
&s;eems to have been calculated on purpo&s;e to exa&s;perate the
pride of her Imperial Maje&s;ty, who&s;e an&s;wer he &s;oon re|ceived,
to this effect: That his Maje&s;ty the King of Pru&s;&s;ia
had already been employed, for &s;ome time, in all kinds of
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable preparations of war, and the mo&s;t
di&s;quieting with regard to the public tranquillity, when
he thought fit to demand explanations of her Maje&s;ty,
touching the military di&s;po&s;itions that were making in her
dominions; di&s;po&s;itions on which &s;he had not re&s;olved till
after the preparations of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had been
made; that though her Maje&s;ty might have declined
explaining her&s;elf on tho&s;e &s;ubjects, which required no
explanation, &s;he had been plea&s;ed to delcare, with her own
mouth, to M. de Klingraafe, that the critical &s;tate of
publick affairs rendered the mea&s;ures &s;he was taking
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for her own &s;afety, and that of her
allies; but that, in other re&s;pects, they tended to the
prejudice of no per&s;on what&s;oever: that her Imperial Ma|je&s;ty
had undoubtedly a right to form what judgment &s;he
plea&s;ed on the circum&s;tances of the times; and likewi&s;e
that it belonged to none but her&s;elf to e&s;timate her own
danger: that her declaration was &s;o clear, &s;he never
imagined it could be thought otherwi&s;e: that being ac|cu&s;tomed
to receive, as well as to practi&s;e the decorums
which &s;overeigns owe to each other, &s;he could not hear
without a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;en&s;ibility the contents of the
memorial now pre&s;ented by M. de Klingraafe; &s;o extra|ordinary,
both in the matter and expre&s;&s;ions, that &s;he would
find her&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the bounds of
that moderation which &s;he had pre&s;cribed to her&s;elf, were
&s;he to an&s;wer the whole of its contents: neverthele&s;s, &s;he
thought proper to declare, that the information communi|cated
to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty of an offen&s;ive alliance again&s;t
him &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between her&s;elf and the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia,
<PB N="10" REF="12">
together with the circum&s;tances and pretended &s;tipulations
of that alliance, were ab&s;olutely fal&s;e and forged, for no
&s;uch treaty did exi&s;t, or ever had exi&s;ted. She concluded
with ob&s;erving, that this declaration would enable all
Europe to judge of what weight and quality tho&s;e dreadful
events were which Klingraafe's memorial announced; and
to perceive that, in any ca&s;e, they could not be imputed
to her Imperial Maje&s;ty. This an&s;wer, though &s;eemingly
explicit, was not deemed &s;ufficiently categorical, or at lea&s;t
not &s;uitable to the purpo&s;es of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who,
by his re&s;ident at Vienna, once more declared, that if the
Empre&s;s-Queen would &s;ign a po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance that &s;he
would not attack his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty either this year or
the next, he would direclty withdraw his troops, and let
things be re&s;otred to their former footing. This demand
was evaded, on pretence that &s;uch an a&s;&s;urance could not
be more binding than the &s;olmn treaty by which he was
already &s;ecured; a treaty which the Empre&s;s-Queen had
no intention to violate. But, before an an&s;wer could be
delivered, the King had actually invaded Saxony, and pub|li&s;hed
his declaration again&s;t the court of Vienna. The
court of Vienna believing that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was
bent upon employing his arms &s;omewhere; being piqued
at the dictatorial manner in which his demands were con|veyed;
unwilling to lay them&s;elves under further re|&s;trictions;
apprehen&s;ive of giving umbrage to their allies,
and confident of having provided for their own &s;ecurity,
re&s;olved to run the ri&s;que of his re&s;entment, not without
hopes of being indemnified in the cour&s;e of the war for
that part of Sile&s;ia which the Queen had been obliged to
cede in the treaty of Bre&s;lau.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. Both &s;ides being thus prepared, and perhaps
equally eager for action, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia would no
longer &s;u&s;pend his operations, and the &s;torm fir&s;t fell upon
Saxony. He re&s;olved to penetrate through that country
into Bohemia, and even to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it as a frontier,
as well as for the convenience of ingre&s;s and egre&s;s to and
from the Au&s;trian dominions. Be&s;ides, he had rea&s;on to
<PB N="11" REF="13">
believe the King of Poland, Elector of Saxony, was con|nected
with the Czarina and the Empre&s;s-Queen; there|fore,
he thought it would be impolitick to leave that
prince in any condition to give him the lea&s;t di&s;turbance.
His army entered the Saxon territory towards the latter
end of Augu&s;t, when he publi&s;hed a declaration, importing
that the unju&s;t conduct and dangerous views of the court
of Vienna again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's dominions laid him under
the nece&s;&s;ity of taking proper mea&s;ures for protecting his
territories and &s;ubjects; that for this purpo&s;e he could not
forbear taking the di&s;agreeable re&s;olution to enter with his
troops the hereditary dominions of his Maje&s;ty the King of
Poland, Elector of Saxony: but he prote&s;ted before God
and man, that on account of his per&s;onal e&s;teem and
friend&s;hip for that prince, he would not have proceeded to
this extremity, had he not been forced to it by the laws of
war, the fatality of the pre&s;ent conjuncture, and the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of providing for the defence and &s;ecurity of his
&s;ubjects. He reminded the publick of the tenderne&s;s with
which he had treated the Elector of Saxony, during the
campaign of the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and
forty-four, and of the bad con&s;equences re&s;ulting to that
monarch from his engagements with the enemies of Pru&s;&s;ia.
He declared that the apprehen&s;ions of being expo&s;ed again
to &s;uch enterpri&s;es had obliged him to take tho&s;e precau|tions
which prudence dictated: but he prote&s;ted in the
mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that he had no ho&s;tile views again&s;t
his Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty, or his dominions; that his troops did
not enter Saxony as enemies, and he had taken care that
they &s;hould ob&s;erve the be&s;t order and the mo&s;t exact di&s;|cipline:
that he de&s;ired nothing more ardently than the
happy minute that &s;hould procure him the &s;atisfaction of
re&s;toring to his Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty his hereditary dominions,
which he had &s;ei&s;ed only as a &s;acred depo&s;itum. By his
mini&s;ter at Dre&s;den, he had demanded a free pa&s;&s;age for
his forces through the Saxon dominions; and this the
King of Poland was ready to grant, with rea&s;onable limi|tations,
to be &s;ettled by commi&s;&s;aries appointed for that
<PB N="12" REF="14">
purpo&s;e. But the&s;e were formalities which did not at all
&s;uit with his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's di&s;po&s;ition or de&s;ign. Even
before this requi&s;ition was made, a body of his troops,
amounting to fifteen thou&s;and, under the command of
Prince Ferdinand, brother to the Duke of Brun&s;wick,
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Leip&s;ick on the twentieth day of Septem|ber.
Here he publi&s;hed a declaration, &s;ignifying that it
was his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's intention to con&s;ider and defend
the inhabitants of that Electorate as if they were his own
&s;ubjects; and that he had given preci&s;e orders to his troops
to ob&s;erve the mo&s;t exact di&s;cipline. As the fir&s;t mark of
his affection, he ordered them to provide the army with all
&s;orts of provi&s;ion, according to a certain rate, on pain of
military execution. That &s;ame evening notice was given
to the corporation of merchants, that their deputies &s;hould
pay all taxes and cu&s;toms to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia: then he
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and exci&s;e-office, and
ordered the magazines of corn and meal to be opened for
the u&s;e of his &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The King of Poland, apprehen&s;ive of &s;uch a
vi&s;itation, had ordered all the troops of his electorate to
leave their quarters, and a&s;&s;emble in a &s;trong camp marked
out for them between Pirna and Konig&s;tein, which was
entrenched, and provided with a numerous train of ar|tillery.
Thither the King of Poland repaired, with his
two &s;ons Xaverius and Charles; but the Queen and the
re&s;t of the royal family remained at Dre&s;den. Of this
capital his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, with the bulk of his army,
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion on the eighth day of September, when he
was vi&s;ited by Lord Stormont, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at
that court, accompanied by Count Salmour, a Saxon
mini&s;ter, who, in his ma&s;ter's name, propo&s;ed a neutrality.
The King of Pru&s;&s;ia profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf extremely well plea&s;ed
with the propo&s;al; and, as the mo&s;t convincing proof of
his neutrality, de&s;ired the King of Poland would &s;eparate
his army, by ordering his troops to return to their former
quarters. His Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty did not like to be &s;o tutored
in his own dominions: he depended for his own &s;afety
<PB N="13" REF="15">
more upon the valour and attachment of his troops thus
a&s;&s;embled, than upon the friend&s;hip of a prince who had
invaded his dominions, and &s;eque&s;tered his revenue with|out
provocation; and he tru&s;ted too much to the &s;ituation
of his camp at Pirna, which was deemed impregnable. In
the mean time, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia fixed his head-quarters
at Seidlitz, about half a German league di&s;tant from Pirna,
and po&s;ted his army in &s;uch a manner as to be able to in|tercept
all convoys of provi&s;ion de&s;igned for the Saxon
camp: his forces extended on the right towards the fron|tiers
of Bohemia, and the vanguard actually &s;ei&s;ed the pa&s;&s;es
that lead to the circles of Satzer and Leutmeritz in that
kingdom; while Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick marched
with a body of troops along the Elbe, and took po&s;t at
this la&s;t place without oppo&s;ition. At the &s;ame time
the King covered his own dominions, by a&s;&s;embling two
con&s;iderable bodies in Upper and Lower Sile&s;ia, which
occupied the pa&s;&s;es that communicated with the circles of
Buntzlau and Koning&s;gratz. Ho&s;tilities were commenced
on the thirteenth day of September by a detachment of
Pru&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars, who attacked an Au&s;trian e&s;corte to a
convoy of provi&s;ions, de&s;igned for the Saxon camp; and
having routed them, carried off a con&s;iderable number of
loaded waggons. The magazines at Dre&s;den were filled
with an immen&s;e quantity of provi&s;ion and forage for the
Pru&s;&s;ian army, and the bakers were ordered to prepare a
va&s;t quantity of bread, for which purpo&s;e thirty new ovens
were erected. When the King of Pru&s;&s;ia fir&s;t arrived at
Dre&s;den, he lodged at the hou&s;e of the Counte&s;s Moczin&s;ka;
and gave orders that the Queen and royal family of Poland
&s;hould be treated with all due veneration and re&s;pect<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">His Maje&s;ty &s;eems to have abated of this re&s;pect in the &s;equel, if we may believe the a&s;&s;ertions of his Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty's Queen, and the court of Vienna, who affirmed, that &s;entinels were po&s;ted within the palace where the Queen and royal family re&s;ided; as al&s;o at the door of the &s;ecret cabinet, where the papers relating to foreign tran&s;actions were depo&s;ited. The keys of this cabi|net were &s;ei&s;ed, and all the writings demanded. The whole Saxon mini&s;try were di&s;charged from their re&s;pective employments, and a new commi&s;&s;ion was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia for the admini&s;tration of affairs in general. When the Queen entreated this prince to remove the &s;entinels po&s;ted within the palace, and contiguous pa&s;&s;ages, agreeably to his a&s;&s;urances that all due re|&s;pect &s;hould be ob&s;erved towards the royal family, the King ordered the guards to be doubled, and &s;ent an officer to demand of her Maje&s;ty the keys of the &s;ecret cabinet. The Queen obtained this officer's con&s;ent, that the doors &s;hould be &s;ealed up; but afterwards he returned with orders to break them open: then her Maje&s;ty, placing her&s;elf before the door, &s;aid, &s;he tru&s;ted &s;o much to the promi&s;e of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, that &s;he could not believe he had given &s;uch orders. The officer declaring that h$s orders were po&s;itive, and that he dur&s;t not di&s;obey them, &s;he continued in the &s;ame place, declaring, that if violence was to be u&s;ed, he mu&s;t begin with her. The officer returning to acquaint the King with what had pa&s;&s;ed, her Maje&s;ty conjured the mini&s;ters of Pru&s;&s;ia and England to remind his maje&s;ty of his promi&s;e, but her re|pre&s;entations had no effect; the officer returned with fre&s;h orders to u&s;e force, in &s;pite of the oppo&s;ition &s;he might make again&s;t it in per&s;on. The Queen, finding her&s;elf in danger of her life, at length withdrew: the doors were forced, the che&s;ts broke open, and all the papers &s;ei&s;ed.</NOTE>:
<PB N="14" REF="16">
even while the Saxon camp was blocked up on every &s;ide,
he &s;ometimes permitted a waggon, loaded with fre&s;h pro|vi&s;ion
and game, to pa&s;s unmole&s;ted for the u&s;e of his
Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. During the&s;e tran&s;actions the greate&s;t part of
the Pru&s;&s;ian army advanced into Bohemia, under the com|mand
of Veldt-Mare&s;chal Keith<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Brother to the Earl Mari&s;chal of Scotland, a gentleman who had &s;ig|nali&s;ed him&s;elf as a general in the Ru&s;&s;ian army, and was accounted one of the be&s;t officers of his time; no$ more admired for his genius, than amiable in his di&s;po&s;ition.</NOTE>, who reduced the town
and palace of Tetchen, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the pa&s;&s;es,
and encamped near Au&s;&s;ig, a &s;mall town in Bohemia, at
no great di&s;tance from the Imperial army, amounting to
fifty thou&s;and men, commanded by Count Brown, an offi|cer
of Iri&s;h extract, who had often di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf
in the field by his courage, vigilance, and conduct. His
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty having left a con&s;iderable body of troops
for the blockade of Pirna, a&s;&s;umed in per&s;on the command
of Mare&s;chal Keith's corps, and advanced to give battle
to the enemy. On the twenty-ninth day of September he
formed his troops in two columns, and in the evening
arrived with his van at Welmina, from whence he &s;aw
the Au&s;trian army po&s;ted with its right at Lowo&s;chutz,
and its left towards the Egra. Having occupied with &s;ix
<PB N="15" REF="17">
battalions a hollow way, and &s;ome ri&s;ing grounds, which
commanded the town of Lowo&s;chutz, he remained all
night under arms at Welmina; and on the fir&s;t day of
October, early in the morning, formed his whole army in
order of battle; the fir&s;t line, con&s;i&s;ting of the infantry,
occupying two hills, and a bottom betwixt them; the
&s;econd line being formed of &s;ome battalions, and the third
compo&s;ed of the whole cavalry. The Au&s;trian general had
taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lowo&s;chutz, with a great body of in|fantry,
and placed a battery of cannon in front of the town:
he had formed his cavalry chequerwi&s;e, in a line between
Lowo&s;chutz and the village of San&s;chitz; and po&s;ted
about two thou&s;and Croats and irregulars in the vineyards
and avenues on his right. The morning was darkened
with a thick fog, which vani&s;hed about &s;even: then the
Pru&s;&s;ian cavalry advanced to attack the enemy's hor&s;e, but
received &s;uch a fire from the irregulars, po&s;ted in vineyards
and ditches, as well as from a numerous artillery, that
they were obliged to retire for protection to the rear of
the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry and cannon. There being formed,
and led back to the charge, they made an impre&s;&s;ion on
the Au&s;trian cavalry, and drove the irregulars and other
bodies of infantry from the ditches, defiles, and vine|yards
which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: but they &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely
in this dangerous &s;ervice, that the King ordered them to
rea&s;cend the hill, and take po&s;t again behind the infan|try,
from whence they no more advanced. In the mean
time a furious cannonading was maintained on both &s;ides
with con&s;iderable effect. At length the left of the Pru&s;&s;ian
infantry was ordered to attack the town of Lowo&s;chutz
in flank; but met with a very warm reception, and, in
all likelihood, would have mi&s;carried, had not Veldt-Mare&s;chal
Keith headed them in per&s;on: when he drew
his &s;word, and told them he would lead them on, he was
given to under&s;tand, that all their powder and &s;hot was
exhau&s;ted; he turned immediately to them with a chear|ful
countenance, &s;aid he was very glad they had no more
ammunition, being well a&s;&s;ured the enemy would not
<PB N="16" REF="18">
with&s;tand them at pu&s;h of bayonet; &s;o &s;aying, he advanced
at their head, and driving the Au&s;trians from Lowo&s;chutz,
&s;et the &s;uburbs on fire. Their infantry had been al|ready
obliged to quit the eminence on the right; and
now their whole army retired to Budin, on the other &s;ide
of the Egra. Some pri&s;oners, colours, and pieces of can|non,
were taken on both &s;ides; and the lo&s;s of each might
amount to two thou&s;and five hundred killed and wounded:
&s;o that, on the whole, it was a drawn battle, though both
generals claimed the victory. The detail of the action,
publi&s;hed at Berlin, declares that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia not
only gained the battle, but that &s;ame day e&s;tabli&s;hed his
head quarters at Lowo&s;chutz: whereas the Au&s;trian ga|zette
affirms, that the Mare&s;chal Count Brown obliged
his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty to retire, and remained all night on
the field of battle; but next day, finding his troops in
want of water, he repaired to the camp of Budin. If
the battle was at all deci&s;ive, the advantage certainly fell
to the Au&s;trians; for his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who, in all
probability, had hoped to winter at Prague, was obliged,
by the oppo&s;ition he met with, to re&s;ign this plan, and
retreat before winter into the electorate of Saxony.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The Pru&s;&s;ian army having rejoined that body
which had been left to block up the Saxons at Pirna,
his Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty and his troops were reduced to &s;uch
extremity of want, that it became indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary
either to attempt an e&s;cape, or &s;urrender to the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia. The former part of the alternative was cho&s;en,
and the plan concerted with Count Brown, the Au&s;trian
general, who, in order to facilitate the execution, advanced
privately with a body of troops to Lichtendorf, near
Schandau; but the junction could not be effected. On
the fourteenth day of October the Saxons threw a bridge
of boats over the Elbe, near Konig&s;tein, to which ca&s;tle
they removed all their artillery; then &s;triking their tents
in the night, pa&s;&s;ed the river undi&s;covered by the enemy.
They continued to retreat with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; but
the roads were &s;o bad, they made little progre&s;s. Next
<PB N="17" REF="19">
day, when part of them had advanced about half way up a
hill oppo&s;ite to Konig&s;tein, and the re&s;t were entangled in a
narrow plain, where there was no room to act, they per|ceived
that the Pru&s;&s;ians were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the pa&s;&s;es,
and found them&s;elves &s;urrounded on every &s;ide, fainting
with hunger and fatigue, and de&s;titute of every conve|nience.
In this deplorable condition they remained, when
the King of Poland, from the fortre&s;s of Konig&s;tein, &s;ent
a letter to his general, the Veldt-Mare&s;chal Count Rutow|&s;ki,&endq;
ve&s;ting him with full and di&s;cretionary power to &s;ur|render,
or take &s;uch other mea&s;ures as he &s;hould judge
mo&s;t conducive to the pre&s;ervation of the officers and &s;ol|diers<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<OPENER>The letter was to the following effect:

</LETTER></NOTE>.
By this time Count Brown had retired to Budin,
&s;o that there was no choice left. A capitulation was de|manded:
but, in effect, the whole Saxon army was
obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion: and the &s;oldiers were
afterwards, by compul&s;ion, incorporated with the troops of
Pru&s;&s;ia. The King of Poland being thus deprived of his
electoral dominions, his troops, arms, artillery, and am|munition,
thought it high time to provide for his own
&s;afety, and retired with all expedition to Poland. His
<PB N="18" REF="20">
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty cantoned his forces in the neighbour|hood
of Seidlitz, and along the Elbe towards Dre&s;|den.
His other army, which had entered Bohemia, un|der
the command of the Count de Schwerin, retired
to the confines of the county of Glatz, where they
were di&s;tributed in quarters of cantonment; &s;o that
this &s;hort campaign was fini&s;hed by the beginning of
November.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The King of Poland, in his di&s;tre&s;s, did not fail to
implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and mediation of neutral powers.
His mini&s;ter at the Hague pre&s;ented a memorial to the
States-General, complaining, that the inva&s;ion of Saxony
was one of tho&s;e attacks again&s;t the law of nations, which,
from the great re&s;pect due to this law, demanded the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of every power intere&s;ted in the pre&s;ervation of its
own liberty and independency. He ob&s;erved, that, from
the fir&s;t glimp&s;e of mi&s;under&s;tanding between the courts of
Vienna and Berlin, he had expre&s;sly enjoined his mini|&s;ters
at all the courts of Europe to declare, that it was
his firm re&s;olution, in the pre&s;ent conjuncture of affairs,
to ob&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t neutrality. He repre&s;ented, that a
free and neutral &s;tate had been, in the mid&s;t of peace, in|vaded
by an enemy, who di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf under the ma&s;que
of friend&s;hip, without alledging the lea&s;t complaint,
or any preten&s;ion what&s;oever; but founding him&s;elf &s;olely
on his own convenience, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter, by armed
force, of all the cities and towns of the electorate, di&s;|mantling
&s;ome, and fortifying others: that he had di&s;armed
the burghers; carried off the magi&s;trates as ho&s;tages for
the payment of unju&s;t and enormous contributions of pro|vi&s;ions
and forage; &s;ei&s;ed the coffers, confi&s;cated the re|venues
of the electorate, broke open the ar&s;enals, and
tran&s;ported the arms and artillery to his own town of
Magdeburgh; aboli&s;hed the privy-council, and, in&s;tead
of the lawful government, e&s;tabli&s;hed a directory,
which acknowledged no other law but his own arbitrary
will. He gave them to under&s;tand, that all the&s;e proceed|ings
were no other than preliminaries to the unheared-of
<PB N="19" REF="21">
treatment which was re&s;erved for a queen, who&s;e virtues
ought to have commanded re&s;pect, even from her enemies:
that, from the hands of that augu&s;t prince&s;s, the archives
of the &s;tate were forced away by menaces and violences,
notwith&s;tanding the &s;ecurity which her Maje&s;ty had pro|mi&s;ed
her&s;elf under the protection of all laws, human and
divine; and notwith&s;tanding the repeated a&s;&s;urances given
by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, that not only her per&s;on, and the
place of her re&s;idence, &s;hould be ab&s;olutely &s;afe, but that
even the Pru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on &s;hould be under her direction.
He ob&s;erved, that a prince who declared him&s;elf protector
of the prote&s;tant religion had begun the war, by cru&s;hing
the very &s;tate to which that religion owes its e&s;tabli&s;h|ment,
and the pre&s;ervation of its mo&s;t invaluable rights:
that he had broke through the mo&s;t re&s;pectable laws which
con&s;titute the union of the Germanick body, under co|lour
of a defence which the Empire &s;tood in no need of, ex|cept
again&s;t him&s;elf: that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, while he
in&s;i&s;ts on having entered Saxony as a friend, demands his
army, the admini&s;tration of his dominions, and, in a word,
the &s;acrifice of his whole electorate; and that the Pru&s;&s;ian
directory, in the declaration of motives, publi&s;hed under
the no&s;e of a prince to whom friend&s;hip was pretended,
thought it &s;uperfluous to alledge even any pretext, to colour
the u&s;urpation of his territories and revenues&mdash;Though
this was certainly the ca&s;e, in his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's fir&s;t
expo&s;ition of motives, the omi&s;&s;ion was afterwards &s;upplied,
in a &s;ub&s;equent memorial to the States-General; in which
he charged the King of Polan, as an accomplice in, if
not an acce&s;&s;ary to the treaty of Peter&s;burgh; and even
taxed him with having agreed to a partition of &s;ome Pru&s;&s;ian
territories, when they &s;hould be conquered. This treaty
of partition, however, appears to have been made in time
of actual war, before all cau&s;e of di&s;pute was removed by
the peace of Dre&s;den.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. While the Au&s;trian and Pru&s;&s;ian armies were in
the field, their re&s;pective mini&s;ters were not idle at Rati&s;|bon,
where three Imperial decrees were publi&s;hed again&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="22">
his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty: the fir&s;t, &s;ummoning that prince to
withdraw his troops from the electorate of Saxony: the &s;e|cond,
commanding all the va&s;&s;als of the Empire employed
by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia to quit that &s;ervice immediately;
and the third, forbidding the members of the empire to
&s;uffer any levies of &s;oldiers, for the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;ervice, to be
rai&s;ed within their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions. The French
mini&s;ter declared to the diet, that the proceedings of his
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty having di&s;clo&s;ed to the world the project
concerted between that prince and the King of England, to
excite in the Empire a religious war, which might be fa|vourable
to their particular views, his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty,
in con&s;equence of his engagement with the Empre&s;s-Queen,
and many other princes of the Empire, being re&s;olved to
&s;uccour them in the mo&s;t e$$icacious manner, would forth|with
&s;end &s;uch a number of troops to their aid, as might
be thought nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve the liberty of the Ger|manick
body. On the other hand, the Pru&s;&s;ian mini&s;ter
a&s;&s;ured the diet, that his ma&s;ter would very &s;oon produce
the proofs that were come to his hands of the plan con|certed
by the courts of Vienna and Dre&s;den, for the &s;ub|ver&s;ion
of his electoral hou&s;e, and for impo&s;ing upon him
a yoke, which &s;eemed to threaten the whole Empire.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. About the &s;ame time, the Ru&s;&s;ian re&s;ident at the
Hague communicated to the States-General a declaration
from his mi&s;tre&s;s, importing, that her Imperial Maje&s;ty hav|ing
&s;een a memorial pre&s;ented at the court of Vienna by the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia's envoy extraordinary, was thereby con|vinced
that this Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's intention was to attack the
territories of the Empre&s;s-Queen; in which ca&s;e, &s;he (the
Czarina) was inevitably obliged to &s;uccour her ally with
all her forces; for which end &s;he had ordered all her troops
in Livonia to be forthwith a&s;&s;embled on the frontiers, and
hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to march: that, moreover,
the Ru&s;&s;ian admiralty had been enjoined to provide imme|diately
a &s;u$$icient number of gallies for tran&s;porting a large
body of troops to Lubeck. The mini&s;ters of the Empre&s;s-Queen,
both at the Hague and at London, delivered me|morials
<PB N="21" REF="23">
to the States-General and his Britannick Maje&s;ty,
demanding the &s;uccours which the&s;e two powers were
bound to afford the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria by the treaty of Aix|la-Chapelle;
but their High Mightine&s;&s;es kept warily aloof,
by dint of eva&s;ion, and the King of Great-Britain was far
otherwi&s;e engaged. The inva&s;ion of Saxony had well nigh
produced tragedies in the royal family of France. The
Dauphine&s;s, who was far advanced in her pregnancy, no
&s;ooner learned the di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances of her parents,
the King and Queen of Poland, than &s;he was &s;eized with
violent fits, which occa&s;ioned a mi&s;carriage, and brought
her life into the mo&s;t imminent danger. The Pru&s;&s;ian mi|ni&s;ter
was immediately ordered to quit Ver&s;ailles; and di|rections
were di&s;patched to the French mini&s;ter at Berlin,
to retire from that court without taking leave. Finally,
the Emperour of Germany concluded a new convention
with the French King, regulating the &s;uccours to be de|rived
from that quarter: he claimed, in all the u&s;ual forms,
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Germanick body, as guarantee of the
pragmatick &s;anction and treaty of Dre&s;den; and Sweden
was al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia did not pa&s;&s;ively bear all
the imputations that were fixed upon his conduct. His
mini&s;ter at the Hague pre&s;ented a memorial, in an&s;wer to
that of the Saxon re&s;ident, in which he accu&s;ed the court
of Dre&s;den of having adopted every part of the &s;cheme
which his enemies had formed for his de&s;truction. He
a$$irmed that the Saxon mini&s;ters had, in all the courts of
Europe, played off every engine of unwarrantable politicks,
in order to pave the way for the execution of their project:
that they had endeavoured to give an odious turn to his
mo&s;t innocent actions: that they had &s;pared neither ma|licious
in&s;inuations, nor even the mo&s;t atrocious calum|nies,
to alienate all the world from his Maje&s;ty, and rai&s;e
up enemies again&s;t him every where. He &s;aid, he had re|ceived
information that the court of Saxony intended to
let his troops pa&s;s freely, and afterwards wait for events of
which they might avail them&s;elves, either by joining his
<PB N="22" REF="24">
enemies, or making a diver&s;ion in his dominions: that in
&s;uch a &s;ituation he could not avoid having recour&s;e to the
only means which were left him for preventing his inevi|table
ruin, by putting it out of the power of Saxony to
increa&s;e the number of his enemies. He a&s;&s;erted, that
all the mea&s;ures he had pur&s;ued in that electorate were but
the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of the fir&s;t re&s;olution he was
forced to take for his own pre&s;ervation: that he had done
nothing but deprived the court of Saxony of the means of
hurting him; and this had been done with all po&s;&s;ible mo|deration:
that the country enjoyed all the &s;ecurity and all
the quiet which could be expected in the very mid&s;t of
peace, the Pru&s;&s;ian troops ob&s;erving the mo&s;t exact di&s;ci|pline:
that all due re&s;pect was &s;hown to the Queen of Po|land,
who had been prevailed upon, by the mo&s;t &s;uitable
repre&s;entations, to &s;uffer &s;ome papers to be taken from the
Paper Office, of which his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty already had
copies; and thought it nece&s;&s;ary, to a&s;certain the dan|gerous
de&s;ign of the Saxon mini&s;try again&s;t him, to &s;ecure
the originals; the exi&s;tence and reality of which might
otherwi&s;e have been denied. He ob&s;erved that every man
has a right to prevent the mi&s;chief with which he is
threatened, and to retort it upon its author; and that
neither the con&s;titutions nor the laws of the Empire could
ob&s;truct the exertion of a right &s;o &s;uperiour to all others as
that of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation and &s;elf-defence; e&s;pecially when
the depo&s;itory of the&s;e laws is &s;o clo&s;ely united to the
enemy, as manife&s;tly to abu&s;e his power in her favour.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. But the mo&s;t important &s;tep which his Pru&s;&s;ian
Maje&s;ty took in his own ju&s;tification, was that of publi&s;h|ing
another memorial, &s;pecifying the conduct of the courts
of Vienna and Saxony, and their dangerous de&s;igns again&s;t
his per&s;on and intere&s;t, together with the original docu|ments
adduced as proofs of the&s;e &s;ini&s;ter intentions. As a
knowledge of the&s;e pieces is requi&s;ite to form a di&s;tinct
idea of the motives which produced the dreadful war upon
the continent, it will not be ami&s;s to u&s;her the &s;ub&s;tance of
them to the reader's acquaintance. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty
<PB N="23" REF="25">
affirms, that to arrive at the &s;ource of the va&s;t plan upon
which the courts of Vienna and Saxony had been em|ployed
again&s;t him ever &s;ince the peace of Dre&s;den, we
mu&s;t trace it as far back as the war which preceded this
peace: that the fond hopes which the two allied courts
had conceived upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the campaign in the year
one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-four gave occa&s;ion
to a treaty of eventual partition, &s;tipulating that the court
of Vienna &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the duchy of Sile&s;ia and the
county of Glatz; while the King of Poland, Elector of
Saxony, &s;hould &s;hare the duchies of Magdeburgh and
Croi&s;&s;en; the circles of Zullichow and Swibus, together
with the Pru&s;&s;ian part of Lu&s;atin: that after the peace of
Dre&s;den, concluded in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred
and forty-five, there was no further room for a treaty
of this nature: yet the court of Vienna propo&s;ed to that
of Saxony a new alliance, in which the treaty of even|tual
partition &s;hould be renewed: but this la&s;t thought it
nece&s;&s;ary, in the fir&s;t place, to give a greater con&s;i&s;tency
to their plan, by grounding it upon an alliance between
the Empre&s;s-Queen and the Czarina. Accordingly the&s;e
two powers did, in fact, conclude a defen&s;ive alliance at
Peter&s;burgh in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing year: but the
body or o&s;ten&s;ible part of this treaty was compo&s;ed merely
with a view to conceal from the knowledge of the
publick &s;ix &s;ecret articles, the fourth of which was level|led
&s;ingly again&s;t Pru&s;&s;ia, according to the exact copy of it,
which appeared among the documents. In this article,
the Empre&s;s-Queen of Hungary and Bohemia &s;ets out
with a prote&s;tation, that &s;he will religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve the
treaty of Dre&s;den: but explains her real way of thinking
upon the &s;ubject, a little lower, in the following terms.
&startq;If the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould be the fir&s;t to depart from
this peace, by attacking either her Maje&s;ty the Empre&s;s-Queen
of Hungary and Bohemia, or her Maje&s;ty the
Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, or even the republick of Poland; in
all the&s;e ca&s;es, the rights of the Empre&s;s-Queen to Si|le&s;ia
and the county of Glatz would again take place,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
and recover their full effect: the two contracting parties
&s;hould mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t each other with &s;ixty thou&s;and men
to atchieve the&s;e conque&s;ts.&endq; The King ob&s;erves upon
this article, that every war which can ari&s;e between him
and Ru&s;&s;ia, or the republick of Poland, would be looked
upon as a manife&s;t infraction of the peace of Dre&s;den,
and a revival of the rights of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria to Sile&s;ia;
though neither Ru&s;&s;ia nor the republick of Poland is at all
concerned in the treaty of Dre&s;den; and though the latter,
with which the King lived in the mo&s;t intimate friend&s;hip,
was not even in alliance with the court of Vienna: that,
according to the principles of the law of nature, received
among all civili&s;ed nations, the mo&s;t the court of Vi|enna
could be authori&s;ed to do in &s;uch ca&s;es, would be
to &s;end tho&s;e &s;uccours to her allies which are due to them
by treaties, without her having the lea&s;t preten&s;e, on that
account, to free her&s;elf from the particular engagements
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting between her and the King; he appealed, there|fore,
to the judgment of the impartial world, whether in
this &s;ecret article the contracting powers had kept with|in
the bounds of a de$en&s;ive alliance; or whether this
article did not rather contain a plan of an offen&s;ive al|liance
again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. He affirmed it was
obvious, from this article, that the court of Vienna had
prepared three pretences for the recovery of Sile&s;ia; and
that &s;he thought to attain her end, either by provoking the
King to commence ho&s;tilities again&s;t her, or to kindle a
war between his Maje&s;ty and Ru&s;&s;ia by her &s;ecret intrigues
and machinations: he alledged that the court of Sax|ony,
being invited to accede to this alliance, eagerly ac|cepted
the invitation; furni&s;hed its mini&s;ters at Peter&s;|burgh
with full powers for that purpo&s;e; and ordered them
to declare that their ma&s;ter was not only ready to accede
to the treaty it&s;elf, but al&s;o to the &s;ecret article again&s;t
Pru&s;&s;ia; and to join in the regulations made by the two
courts, provided e$$ectual mea&s;ures &s;hould be taken, as
well for the &s;ecurity of Saxony, as for its indemnification
and recompen&s;e, in proportion to the efforts and progre&s;s
<PB N="25" REF="27">
that might be made: that the court of Dre&s;den declared,
if upon any fre&s;h attack from the King of Pru&s;&s;ia the
Empre&s;s-Queen &s;hould, by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, not only re|conquer
Sile&s;ia, and the county of Glatz, but al&s;o reduce
him within narrower bounds, the King of Poland, as
Elector of Saxony, would abide by the partition formerly
&s;tipulated between him and the Empre&s;s-Queen. He
al&s;o declared that Count Lo&s;s, the Saxon mini&s;ter at Vi|enna,
was charged to open a private negociation for &s;ettling
an eventual partition of the conque&s;t which might be
made on Pru&s;&s;ia, by laying down, as the ba&s;is of it, the
treaty of Leip&s;ick, &s;igned on the eighteenth day of May, in
the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-five, as
would appear by the documents affixed. He owned it had
been &s;uppo&s;ed, through the whole of this negociation,
that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould be the aggre&s;&s;or again&s;t
the court of Vienna; but he in&s;i&s;ted, that even in this
ca&s;e the King of Poland could have no right to make con|que&s;ts
on his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty. He likewi&s;e acknowledged
that the court of Saxony had not yet acceded in form to
the treaty of Peter&s;burgh; but he ob&s;erved, its allies were
given to under&s;tand again and again, that it was ready to
accede without re&s;triction, whenever this could be done
without ri&s;que; and the advantages to be gained &s;hould be
&s;ecured in its favour: circum&s;tances proved by divers au|thentick
documents, particularly by a letter from Count
Fleming to Count de Bruhl, informing him that Count
Uhlefield had charged him to repre&s;ent afre&s;h to his court,
that they could not take too &s;ecure mea&s;ures again&s;t the
ambitious views of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia; that Saxony, in
particular, ought to be cautious, as being the mo&s;t expo&s;ed:
that it was of the highe&s;t importance to &s;trengthen their
old engagements upon the footing propo&s;ed by the late
Count de Harrach in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and forty-five; a &s;tep which might be taken on occa&s;ion
of his Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion to the treaty of Peter&s;|burgh.
The an&s;wer of Count Bruhl to this di&s;patch im|ported,
That the King of Poland was not aver&s;e to treat
<PB N="26" REF="28">
in the utmo&s;t &s;ecre&s;y with the court of Vienna about
&s;uccours, by private and confidential declarations relating
to the fourth &s;ecret article of the treaty of Peter&s;burgh,
on condition of rea&s;onable terms and advantages, which
in this ca&s;e ought to be granted to his Maje&s;ty. He quoted
other di&s;patches, to prove the unwillingne&s;s of his Poli&s;h
Maje&s;ty to declare him&s;elf, until the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould
be attacked, and his forces divided; and that this &s;cruple
was admitted by the allies of Saxony. From the&s;e pre|mi&s;&s;es
he deduced this inference, that the court of Dre&s;den,
without having acceded in form to the treaty of Peter&s;|burgh,
was not le&s;s an accomplice in the dangerous de&s;igns
which the court of Vienna had grounded upon this treaty;
and that having been di&s;pen&s;ed with from a formal concur|rence,
it had only waited for that moment when it might,
without running any great ri&s;que, concur in effect, and
&s;hare the &s;poils of its neighbour. In expectation of this
period, he &s;aid, the Au&s;trian and Saxon mini&s;ters laboured
in concert and underhand with the more ardour, to bring
the <HI>Ca&s;us Foederis</HI> into exi&s;tence; for it being laid down as
a principle in the treaty, that any war whatever between
him and Ru&s;&s;ia would authorize the Empre&s;s-Queen to
retake Sile&s;ia, there was nothing more to be done but to
kindle &s;uch a war; for which purpo&s;e no method was found
more proper than that of embroiling the King with the
Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia; and to provoke that prince&s;s with all
forts of fal&s;e in&s;inuations, impo&s;tures, and the mo&s;t atro|cious
calumnies, in laying to his Maje&s;ty's charge a variety
of de&s;igns, &s;ometimes again&s;t Ru&s;&s;ia, and even the per&s;on
of the Czarina; &s;ometimes views upon Poland, and &s;ome|times
intrigues in Sweden. By the&s;e and other &s;uch con|trivances,
he affirmed they had kindled the animo&s;ity of
the Empre&s;s to &s;uch a degree, that in a council held in the
month of October, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and fifty-three, &s;he had re&s;olved to attack the King of Pru&s;&s;ia,
without any further di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, whether he &s;hould fall upon
any of the allies of Ru&s;&s;ia, or one of them &s;hould begin
<PB N="27" REF="29">
with him: a re&s;olution which for that time was fru&s;trated
by their want of &s;eamen and magazines; but the prepa|rations
were continued, under pretence of keeping them|&s;elves
in a condition to fulfil their engagements contracted
in the la&s;t &s;ub&s;idiary convention with England; and when
all were fini&s;hed, the &s;torm would fall on the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of that famous memorial
publi&s;hed by his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, to which the ju&s;tifying
pieces or authentick documents were annexed; and to
which a circum&s;tantial an&s;wer was exhibited by the parti|&s;ans
of her Imperial Maje&s;ty. Specious rea&s;ons may,
doubtle&s;s, be adduced on either &s;ide of almo&s;t any di&s;pute,
by writers of ingenuity: but, in examining this conte&s;t,
it mu&s;t be allowed that both &s;ides adopted illicit practices.
The Empre&s;s-Queen and the Elector of Saxony had cer|tainly
a right to form defen&s;ive treaties for their own pre|&s;ervation;
and, without all doubt, it was their intere&s;t and
their duty to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the enterpri&s;es of &s;uch
a formidable neighbour: but, at the &s;ame time, the con|tracting
parties &s;eem to have carried their views much
farther than defen&s;ive mea&s;ures. Perhaps the court of
Vienna con&s;idered the ce&s;&s;ion of Sile&s;ia as a circum&s;tance
altogether compul&s;ive, and, therefore, not binding again&s;t
the rights of natural equity. She did not at all doubt that
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia would be tempted by his ambition and
great warlike power to take &s;ome &s;tep which might be
ju&s;tly interpreted into an infraction of the treaty of Dre&s;den,
and in that ca&s;e &s;he was determined to avail her&s;elf of the
confederacy &s;he had formed, that &s;he might retrieve the
countries &s;he had lo&s;t by the unfortunate events of the la&s;t
war, as well as bridle the dangerous power and di&s;po&s;ition
of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch: and, in all probability, the King
of Poland, over and above the &s;ame con&s;ideration, was de|&s;irous
of &s;ome indemnification for the la&s;t irruption into
his electoral dominions, and the great &s;ums he had paid
for the &s;ub&s;equent peace. Whether they were authori&s;ed
by the law of nature and nations to make repri&s;als by an
<PB N="28" REF="30">
actual partition of the countries they might conquer, &s;up|po&s;ing
him to be the aggre&s;&s;or, we &s;hal not pretend to
determine: but it does not at all appear that his Pru&s;&s;ian
Maje&s;ty's danger was &s;uch as entitled him to take tho&s;e
violent &s;teps which he now attempted to ju&s;tify. By this
time the flame of war was kindled up to a blaze that &s;oon
filled the Empire with ruin and de&s;olation; and the King
of Pru&s;&s;ia had drawn upon him&s;elf the re&s;entement of the
three greate&s;t powers in Europe, who laid a&s;ide their form|er
animo&s;ities, and every con&s;ideration of that balance
which it had co&s;t &s;uch blood and trea&s;ure to pre&s;erve, in
order to con&s;pire his de&s;truction. The King him&s;elf
could not but fore&s;ee this confederacy, and know the
power it might exert: but probably he con$ided &s;o much
in the number, the valour, and di&s;cipline of his troops; in
the &s;kill of his officers; in his own conduct and activity;
that he hoped to cru&s;h the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria by one rapid
endeavour at the latter end of the &s;ea&s;on, or at lea&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;h
him&s;elf in Bohemia, before her allies could move to
her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In this hope, however, he was di&s;appointed
by the vigilance of the Au&s;trian councils. He found the
Empre&s;s-Queen in a condition to make head again&s;t him
in every avenue to her dominions; and in a fair way of
being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the circles of the empire. He &s;aw him&s;elf
threatened with the vengeance of the Ru&s;&s;ian empre&s;s, and
the &s;word of France gleaming over his head, without any
pro&s;pect of a&s;&s;i&s;tance but that which he might derive from
his alliance with Great-Britain. Thus the K&mdash;of
E&mdash;d exchanged the alliance of R&mdash;, who was
his &s;ub&s;idiary, and the friend&s;hip of the Empre&s;s-Queen,
his old and natural ally, for a new connexion with his
P&mdash;n Maje&s;ty, who could neither act as an auxili|ary
to G&mdash;B&mdash;n, nor as a protector to H&mdash;; and
for this connexion, the advantage of which was merely
negative, &s;uch a price was paid by E&mdash;d as had
never been given by any other po$en$ate of Europe, even
for &s;ervices of the greate&s;t importance.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31">
&sect; XVI. About the latter end of November the Saxon
mini&s;ter at Rati&s;bon delivered to the diet a new and ample
memorial, explaining the lamentable &s;tate of that electo|rate,
and imploring afre&s;h the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Empire.
The King of Pru&s;&s;ia had al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed a letter to the diet,
demanding &s;uccour of the &s;everal &s;tates, agreeably to their
guarantees of the treaties of We&s;tphalia and Dre&s;den:
but the mini&s;ter of Mentz, as director of the diet, having
refu&s;ed to lay it before that a&s;&s;embly, the mini&s;ter of Bran|denburgh
ordered it to be printed, and &s;ent to his court for
further in&s;tructions. In the mean time, his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty
thought proper to intimate to the King and &s;enate of
Poland, that &s;hould the Ru&s;&s;ian troops be permitted to
march through that kingdom, they might expect to &s;ee
their country made a &s;cene of war and de&s;olation. In
France the pro&s;pect of a general and &s;anguinary war did
not at all allay the di&s;turbance which &s;prang from the di&s;|&s;ention
between the clergy and parliament, touching the
bull Unigenitus. The King being again brought over to
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ide of the di&s;pute, received a brief from
the Pope, laying it down as a fundamental article, that
who&s;oever refu&s;es to &s;ubmit to the bull Unigenitus is in
the way to damnation: and certain ca&s;es are &s;pecified, in
which the &s;acraments are to be denied. The parliament
of Paris, con&s;idering this brief or bull as a direct attack
upon the rights of the Gallican church, i&s;&s;ued an arret
or decree, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the &s;aid bull; re&s;erving to them&s;elves
the right of providing again&s;t the inconveniencies with
which it might be attended; as well as the privilege to
maintain in their full force the prerogatives of the crown,
the power and juri&s;diction of the bi&s;hops, the liberties of
the Gallican church, and the cu&s;toms of the realm. The
King, di&s;&s;atisfied with their interpo&s;ition, declared his
de&s;ign to hold a bed of ju&s;tice in per&s;on at the palace.
Accordingly, on the twelfth day of November, the whole
body of his guards, amounting to ten thou&s;and men, took
po&s;t in the city of Paris: and next day the King repaired
with the u&s;ual ceremony to the palace, where the bed of
<PB N="30" REF="32">
ju&s;tice was held: among other regulations, an edict was
i&s;&s;ued for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the fourth and fifth chambers of in|que&s;ts,
the members of which had remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves by their oppo&s;ition to the bull Unigenitus.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. In England, the dearth of corn, ari&s;ing in a
great mea&s;ure from the iniquitous practice of engro&s;&s;ing,
was &s;o &s;everely felt by the common people, that in&s;urrec|tions
were rai&s;ed in Shrop&s;hire and Warwick&s;hire by the
populace, in conjunction with the colliers, who &s;ei&s;ed by
violence all the provi&s;ion they could find; pillaging with|out
di&s;tinction the millers, farmers, grocers, and butch|ers,
until they were di&s;per&s;ed by the gentlemen of the
country, at the heads of their tenants and dependants.
Di&s;orders of the &s;ame nature were excited by the colliers
on the fore&s;t of Dean, and tho&s;e employed in the works
in Cumberland. The corporations, noblemen, and
gentlemen, in different parts of the kingdom, exerted
them&s;elves for the relief of the poor, who were greatly
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and a grand council being a&s;&s;embled at St.
James's on the &s;ame &s;ubject, a proclamation was publi&s;h|ed,
for putting the laws in &s;peedy and effectual execution
again&s;t the fore&s;tallers and engro&s;&s;ers of corn.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The fear of an inva&s;ion having now &s;ub&s;ided,
and Hanover being &s;uppo&s;ed in greater danger than Great-Britain,
the auxiliaries of that electorate were tran&s;ported
from England to their own country. At the latter end of
the &s;ea&s;on, when the weather became &s;evere, the inn-keepers
of England refu&s;ed to admit the He&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers
into winter quarters, as no provi&s;ion had been made for
that purpo&s;e by act of parliament; &s;o that they were
obliged to hut their camp, and remain in the open fields
till January: but the rigour of this uncomfortable &s;itua|tion
was &s;oftened by the hand of generous charity, which
liberally &s;upplied them with all manner of refre&s;hment,
and other conveniencies: an humane interpo&s;ition, which
re&s;cued the national character from the imputation of
cruelty and ingratitude.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33">
&sect; XIX. On the &s;econd day of December his Maje&s;ty
opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament with a &s;peech that &s;eemed
to be dictated by the genius of England. He expre&s;&s;ed
his confidence, that, under the guidance of divine Pro|vidence,
the union, fortitude, and affection of his people
would enable him to &s;urmount all difficulties, and vindi|cate
the dignity of his crown again&s;t the ancient enemy
of Great Britain. He declared that the &s;uccour and pre|&s;ervation
of America con&s;tituted a main object of his at|tention
and &s;ollicitude; and ob&s;erved, that the growing
dangers to which the Briti&s;h colonies might &s;tand expo&s;ed,
from late lo&s;&s;es in that country, $emanded re&s;olutions of
vigour and di&s;patch. He &s;aid an adequate and firm defence
at home &s;hould maintain the chief place in his thoughts;
and in this great view he had nothing &s;o much at heart as
to remove all grounds of di&s;&s;atisfaction from his people: for
this end, he recommended to the care and diligence of the
parliament the framing of a national militia, planned and
regulated with equal regard to the ju&s;t rights of his crown
and people; an in&s;titution which might become one good
re&s;ource in time of general danger. He took notice that
the unnatural union of councils abroad, the calamities
which, in con&s;equence of this unhappy conjunction, mights,
by irruptions of foreign armies into the Empire, &s;hake its
con&s;titution, overturn its &s;y&s;tem, and threaten oppre&s;&s;ion
to the prote&s;tant intere&s;t on the continent, were events
which mu&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affect the minds of the Briti&s;h nation,
and had fixed the eyes of Europe on this new and danger|ous
cri&s;is. He gave them to under&s;tand that the body of
his electoral troops, which were brought hither at the
de&s;ire of his parliament, he had now directed to return to
his dominions in Germany, relying with plea&s;ure on the
&s;pirit and zeal of his people, in defence of his per&s;on and
realm. He told the Commons that he confided in their
wi&s;dom, for preferring more vigorous efforts, though more
expen&s;ive, to a le&s;s effectual, and therefore le&s;s $rugal plan
of war; that he had placed before them the dangers and
nece&s;&s;ities of the publick; and it was their duty to lay the
<PB N="32" REF="34">
burthens they &s;hould judge unavoidable in &s;uch a manner
as would lea&s;t di&s;turb and exhau&s;t his people. He ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his concern for the &s;ufferings of the poor, ari&s;ing
from the pre&s;ent dearth of corn, and for the di&s;turbances
to which it had given ri&s;e; and exhorted his parliament
to con&s;ider of proper provi&s;ions for preventing the like
mi&s;chiefs hereafter. He concluded with remarking, that
unpro&s;perous events of war in the Mediterranean had
drawn from his &s;ubjects &s;ignal proofs how dearly they
tendered the honour of his crown; therefore they could
not, on his part, fail to meet with ju&s;t returns of unwea|ried
care, and uncea&s;ing endeavours for the glory, pro&s;pe|rity,
and happine&s;s of his people.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. The King having retired from the Hou&s;e of
Peers, the &s;peech was read by Lord Sandys, appointed to
act as &s;peaker to that hou&s;e; then Earl Gower moved for
an addre&s;s, which, however, was not carried without
objection. In one part of it his Maje&s;ty was thanked
for having cau&s;ed a body of electoral troops to come
into England at the reque&s;t of his parliament; and this
article was di&s;agreeable to tho&s;e who had di&s;approved of
the reque&s;t in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion. They &s;aid they wi&s;hed to
&s;ee the pre&s;ent addre&s;s unanimou&s;ly agreed to by the
Lords; a &s;atisfaction they could not have if &s;uch a pa|ragraph
&s;hould be in&s;erted: for they &s;till thought the
bringing over Hanoverian troops a prepo&s;terous mea&s;ure;
becau&s;e it had not only loaded the nation with an enor|mous
expen&s;e, but al&s;o furni&s;hed the court of France with
a plau&s;ible pretence for invading the electorate, which
otherwi&s;e it would have no &s;hadow of rea&s;on to attack;
be&s;ides, the expedient was held in reprobation by the
&s;ubjects in general, and &s;uch a paragraph might be con|&s;idered
as an in&s;ult on the people. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e
exceptions, which did not &s;eem to be very important,
the addre&s;s, including this paragraph, was approved by a
great majority.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. In the addre&s;s of the Commons no &s;uch para|graph
was in&s;erted. As &s;oon as the Speaker had recited
<PB N="33" REF="35">
his Maje&s;ty's &s;peech, Mr. C. Town&s;hend propo&s;ed the
heads of an addre&s;s, to which the Hou&s;e unanimou&s;ly
agreed; and it was pre&s;ented accordingly. This nece&s;&s;a|ry
form was no &s;ooner di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, than the Hou&s;e, with a
warmth of humanity and benevolence &s;uitable to &s;uch an
a&s;&s;embly, re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee, to deliberate
on that part of his Maje&s;ty's &s;peech which related to the
dearth of corn that &s;o much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the poorer cla&s;s of
people. A bill was immediately framed, to prohibit, for
a time limited, the exportation of corn, malt, meal, flour,
bread, bi&s;cuit and &s;tarch; and a re&s;olution unanimou&s;ly
taken to addre&s;s the Sovereign, that an embrago might be
forthwith laid upon all &s;hips laden or to be laden with
the&s;e commodities to be exported from the ports of Great
Britain and Ireland. At the &s;ame time Vice-Admiral
Bo&s;cawen, from the board of admiralty, informed the
hou&s;e, that the King and the board having been di&s;&s;atis|fied
with the conduct of Admiral Byng, in a late action
with the French fleet in the Mediterranean, and for the
appearance of his not having acted agreeably to his in|&s;tructions
for the relief of Minorca, he was then in cu&s;tody
of the Mar&s;hal of the Admiralty, in order to be tried by
a court-martial: that although this was no more than
what was u&s;ual in like ca&s;es, yet as Admiral Byng was
then a member of the hou&s;e, and as his confinement
might detain him &s;ome time from his duty there, the
board of Admiralty thought it a re&s;pect due to the hou&s;e
to inform them of the commitment and detainer of the
&s;aid Admiral. This me&s;&s;age being delivered, the journal
of the hou&s;e in relation to Rear-Admiral Knowles<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rear-Admiral Knowles being, in the month of December, one thou|&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-nine, tried at Deptford, before a court-martial, for his behaviour in and relating to an action which happened on the fir&s;t day of October in the preceding year, between a Briti&s;h &s;quadron under his com|mand, and a &s;quadron of Spain, the court was unanimou&s;ly of opinion, that the &s;aid Knowles, while he was &s;tanding for the en$my, might, by a different di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;quadron, have begun the attack with &s;ix &s;hips as early in the day as four of them were engaged; and that, therefore, by his neglecting &s;o to do, he gave the enemy a manife&s;t advantage: that the &s;aid Knowles remained on board the &s;hip Cornwall with his flag, after &s;he was di&s;abled from continuing the action, though he might, upon her being di&s;abled, have &s;hifted his flag on board another &s;hip; and the court were unanimou&s;ly of opinion he ought to have done &s;o, in order to have conducted and directed, during the whole action, the motions of the &s;quadron entru&s;ted to his care and conduct. Upon con&s;ideration of the whole conduct of the &s;aid Knowles, re|lating to that action, the court did unanimou&s;ly agree that he fell under part of the fourteenth article of the articles of war, namely, the word Negli|gence, and no other; and al&s;o under the twenty-third article.&mdash;The court, therefore, unanimou&s;ly adjudged that he &s;hould be reprimanded for not bringing up the &s;quadron in clo&s;er order than he did, and not beginning the attack with as great force as he might have done; and al&s;o for not &s;hifting his flag, upon the Cornwall's being di&s;abled.</NOTE> was

means, being appointed, took into con&s;ideration the ne|ce&s;&s;ities
of the &s;tate, and made very ample provi&s;ion for
enabling his Maje&s;ty to maintain the war with vigour.

<P>&sect; XXIII. Some of the&s;e impo&s;itions were demmed
grievous hard&s;hips by tho&s;e upon whom they immediately
fell; and many friends of their country exclaimed again&s;t
the projected army of ob&s;ervation in Germany, as the com|mencement
of a ruinous continental war, which it was
neither the intere&s;t of the nation to undertake, nor in their
power to maintain, without &s;tarving the operations by &s;ea,
and in America, founded on Briti&s;h principles; without
<PB N="37" REF="39">
contracting &s;uch an additional load of debts and taxes, as
could not fail to terminate in bankruptcy and di&s;tre&s;s. To
tho&s;e dependents of the mini&s;try, who ob&s;erved, that as
Hanover was threatened by France for its connexion with
Great-Britain, it ought, in common gratitude, to be pro|tected,
they replied, that every &s;tate, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting an ally,
ought to have a regard to its own pre&s;ervation: that if the
King of England enjoyed by inheritance, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, a
province in the heart of France, it would be equally ab&s;urd
and unju&s;t, in ca&s;e of a rupture with that kingdom, to ex|hau&s;t
the trea&s;ures of Great-Britain in the defence of &s;uch
a province; and yet the inhabitants of it would have the
&s;ame right to complain that they &s;uffered for their con|nexion
with England. They ob&s;erved, that other do|minions,
electorates, and principalities in Germany were
&s;ecured by the con&s;titutions of the Empire, as well as by
faire and equal alliances with their co-e&s;tates; whereas
Hanover &s;tood &s;olitary, like a hunted deer avoided by the
herd, and had no other &s;helter but that of &s;hrinking under
the extended &s;hield of Great-Britain: that the reluctance
expre&s;&s;ed by the German princes to undertake the defence
of the&s;e dominions flowed from a firm per&s;ua&s;ion, founded
on experience, that England would interpo&s;e as a princi|pal,
and not only draw her &s;word again&s;t the enemies of
the electorate, but concentrate her chief &s;trength in that
object, and wa&s;te her trea&s;ures in purcha&s;ing their con|currence;
that, exclu&s;ive of an ample revenue drained from
the &s;weat of the people, great part of which had been
expended in continental efforts, the whole national debt in|curred
&s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of the late king had been con|tracted
in pur&s;uance of mea&s;ures totally foreign to the in|tere&s;t
of the&s;e kingdoms: that, &s;ince Hanover was the fa|vourite
object, England would &s;ave money, and great quan|tities
of Briti&s;h blood, by allowing France to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the electorate, paying its ran&s;om at the peace, and in|demnifying
the inhabitants for the damage they might
&s;u&s;tain; an expedient that would be productive of ano|ther
good con&s;equence; it would rou&s;e the German
princes from their affected indifference, and oblige them
<PB N="38" REF="40">
to exert them&s;elves with vigour, in order to avoid the de|te&s;ted
neighbourhood of &s;uch an enterpri&s;ing invader.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. The article of the &s;upply relating to the ar|my
of ob&s;ervation took ri&s;e from a me&s;&s;age &s;igned by his
Maje&s;ty, and pre&s;ented by Mr. Pitt, now promoted to the
office of principal &s;ecretary of &s;tate; a gentleman who
had, upon &s;undry occa&s;ions, combated the gigantick plan
of continental connexions with all the &s;trength of rea&s;on,
and all the powers of eloquence. He now imparted to the
Hou&s;e an intimation, importing, It was always with re|luctance
that his Maje&s;ty a&s;ked extraordinary &s;upplies of
his people; but as the united councils, and formidable pre|parations
of France and her allies threatened Europe in
general with the mo&s;t alarming con&s;equences; and as the&s;e
unju&s;t and vindictive de&s;igns were particularly and imme|diately
bent again&s;t his Maje&s;ty's electoral dominions, and
tho&s;e of his good ally, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, his Maje&s;ty con|fided
in the experienced zeal and affection of his faithful
Commons, that they would chearfully a&s;&s;i&s;t him in form|ing
and maintaining an army of ob&s;ervation, for the ju&s;t
and nece&s;&s;ary defence and pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e territories,
and enable him to fulfil his engagements with his Pru&s;&s;ian
Maje&s;ty, for the &s;ecurity of the Empire again&s;t the irruption
of foreign armies, and for the &s;upport of the common
cau&s;e. Po&s;terity will hardly believe, that the Emperor and
all the princes in Germany were in a con&s;piracy again&s;t
their country, except the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, the Elector of
Hanover, and the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el; and they
will, no doubt, be &s;urpri&s;ed, that Great-Britain, after all
the treaties &s;he had made, and the numberle&s;s &s;ub&s;idies
&s;he had granted, &s;hould not have an ally left, except one
prince, &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed in his own affairs, that he could
grant her no &s;uccour, whatever a&s;&s;i&s;tance he might demand.
The King's me&s;&s;age met with as favourable a reception as
he could have de&s;ired. It was read in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
together with a copy of the treaty between his
Maje&s;ty and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, including the &s;ecret and
&s;eparate article, and the declaration &s;igned on each &s;ide by
the plenipotentiaries at We&s;tmin&s;ter: the reque&s;t was
<PB N="39" REF="41">
granted, and the convention approved. With equal rea|dine&s;s
did they gratify his Maje&s;ty's inclination, &s;ignified
in another me&s;&s;age, delivered on the &s;eventeenth day of
May, by Lord Bateman, intimating, That, in this critical
juncture, emergencies might ari&s;e of the utmo&s;t impor|tance,
and be attended with the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;e|quences,
if proper means &s;hould not be immediately ap|plied
to prevent or defeat them; his Maje&s;ty was, there|fore,
de&s;irous that the Hou&s;e would enable him to defray
any extraordinary expen&s;es of the war, incurred or to be
incurred for the &s;ervice of the current year; and to take
all &s;uch mea&s;ures as might be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;appoint or
defeat any enterpri&s;es or de&s;igns of his enemies, as the
exigency of affairs might require. The committee of
&s;upply forthwith granted a very large &s;um for the&s;e pur|po&s;es,
including the charge of German mercenaries. A
like me&s;&s;age being at the &s;ame time communicated to the
Upper Hou&s;e, their lord&s;hips voted a very loyal addre&s;s
upon the occa&s;ion; and when the article of &s;upply, which
it produced among the Commons, fell under their in|&s;pection,
they unanimou&s;ly agreed to it, by way of a
clau&s;e of appropriation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. We have already ob&s;erved, that the fir&s;t bill
which the Commons pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;e&s;&s;ion was for the relief
of the poor, by prohibiting the exportation of corn; but
this remedy not being judged adequate to the evil, another
bill was framed, removing, for a limited time, the duty
then payable upon foreign corn and flour imported; as
al&s;o permitting, for a certain term, all &s;uch foreign corn,
grain, meal, bread, bi&s;cuit, and flour, as had been or &s;hould
be taken from the enemy, to be landed and expended in the
kingdom duty free. In order &s;till more to reduce the high
price of corn, and to prevent any &s;upply of provi&s;ions from
being &s;ent to our enemies in America, a third bill was
brought in, prohibiting, for a time therein limited, the
exportation of corn, grain, meal, malt, flour, bread, bi&s;|cuit,
&s;tarch, beef, pork, bacon, or other victual, from any
of the Briti&s;h plantations, unle&s;s to Great-Britain or Ire|land,
or from one colony to another. To this act two
<PB N="40" REF="42">
clau&s;es were added, for allowing tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries, men|tioned
above, to be imported in foreign built &s;hips, and
from any &s;tate in amity with his Maje&s;ty, either into
Great-Britain or Ireland; and for exporting from South|ampton
or Exeter to the I&s;le of Man, for the u&s;e of the
inhabitants, a quantity of wheat, barley, oats, meal, or
flour, not exceeding two thou&s;and five hundred quarters.
The Commons would have &s;till improved their humanity,
had they contrived and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ome effectual method
to puni&s;h tho&s;e unfeeling villains, who, by engro&s;&s;ing and
hoarding up great quantities of grain, had created this
artificial &s;carcity, and deprived their fellow creatures of
bread, with a view to their own private advantage. Upon
a &s;ub&s;equent report of the committee, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved,
that, to prevent the high price of wheat and bread, no
&s;pirits &s;hould be di&s;tilled from wheat for a limited time.
While the bill, formed on this re&s;olution, was in embryo,
a petition was pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e by the brewers of
London, We&s;tmin&s;ter, Southwark, and parts adjacent,
repre&s;enting, that, when the re&s;olution pa&s;&s;ed, the price
of malt, which was before too high, immediately ro&s;e to
&s;uch a degree, that the petitioners found them&s;elves utterly
incapable of carrying on bu&s;ine&s;s at the price malt then
bore, occa&s;ioned, as they conceived, from an apprehen&s;ion
of the nece&s;&s;ity the di&s;tillers would be under to make u&s;e
of the be&s;t pale malt, and &s;ub&s;titute the be&s;t barley in lieu
of wheat: that, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the markets would not be
able to &s;upply a &s;u$$icient quantity of barley for the de|mands
of both profe&s;&s;ions, be&s;ides other nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es:
they, therefore, prayed, that, in regard to the publick
revenue, to which the trade of the petitioners &s;o largely
contributed, proper mea&s;ures might be taken for prevent|ing
the public lo&s;s, and relieving their particular di&s;tre&s;s.
The Hou&s;e would not lend a deaf ear to a remon&s;trance
in which the revenue was concerned. The members ap|pointed
to prepare the bill immediately received in&s;tructions
to make provi&s;ion in it to re&s;train, for a limited time, the
di&s;tilling of barley, malt, and all grain what&s;oever. The
bill was framed accordingly, but did not pa&s;s without
<PB N="41" REF="43">
&s;trenuous oppo&s;ition. To this prohibition it was objected,
that there are always large quantities of wheat and bar|ley
in the kingdom &s;o much damaged, as to be unfit for
any u&s;e but the di&s;tillery, con&s;equently a re&s;triction of this
nature would ruin many farmers, and others employed in
the trade of malting. Particular intere&s;ts, however, mu&s;t
often be &s;acrificed to the welfare of the community; and
the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s prevailed over the pro&s;pect of this di&s;|advantage.
If they had allowed any &s;ort of grain to be
di&s;tilled, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the di|&s;tilling
of every kind. The prohibition was limited to
two months; but at the expiration of that term, the
&s;carcity &s;till continuing, it was protracted by a new bill to
the eleventh day of December, with a provi&s;o, empowering
his Maje&s;ty to put an end to it at any time after the
eleventh day of May, if &s;uch a &s;tep &s;hould be judged for
the advantage of the kingdom.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. The next bill that engaged the attention of
the Commons was a mea&s;ure of the utmo&s;t national im|portance,
though &s;ecretly di&s;liked by many individuals of
the legi&s;lature, who neverthele&s;s did not venture to avow
their di&s;approbation. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of a militia was
a very popular and de&s;irable object, but attended with
numberle&s;s difficulties, and a competition of intere&s;ts
which it was impo&s;&s;ible to reconcile. It had formerly been
an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of contention between the crown
and the Commons; but now both apparently concurred in
rendering it &s;erviceable to the commonwealth; though
&s;ome acquie&s;ced in the &s;cheme, who were not at all hearty
in its favour. On the fourth day of December, a motion
was made for the bill, by Colonel George Town&s;hend,
elde&s;t &s;on of Lord Vi&s;count Town&s;hend, a gentleman of
courage, &s;en&s;e, and probity; endued with penetration to
di&s;cern, and hone&s;ty to pur&s;ue the real intere&s;t of his coun|try,
in de$iance of power, in contempt of private advan|tages.
Leave being given to bring in a bill for the better
ordering of the militia $orces in the &s;everal counties of
England, the ta&s;k of preparing it was allotted to Mr.
<PB N="42" REF="44">
Town&s;hend, and a con&s;iderable number of the mo&s;t able
members in the Hou&s;e, comprehending his own brother,
Mr. Charles Town&s;hend, who&s;e genius &s;hone with di|&s;tingui&s;hed
lu&s;tre: he was keen, di&s;cerning, eloquent, and
accurate; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a remarkable vivacity of parts, with a
&s;urpri&s;ing &s;olidity of under&s;tanding; was a wit without
arrogance, a patriot without prejudice, and a courtier
without dependance.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. While the militia bill remained under con&s;i|deration
of the Hou&s;e, a petition for a con&s;titutional and
well regulated milita was pre&s;ented by the mayor, jurats,
and commonalty of the King's town and pari&s;h of Maid|&s;tone,
in Kent, in common-council a&s;&s;embled. At the
&s;ame time remon&s;trances were offered by the prote&s;tant
di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters of the three denominations in and about
the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter; by the prote&s;tant
di&s;&s;enters of Shrew&s;bury; the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters of De|von&s;hire;
the prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters, being freeholders and
burge&s;&s;es of the town, and county of the town of Notting|ham,
joined with other inhabitants of the church of Eng|land,
expre&s;&s;ing their apprehen&s;ion, that, in the bill then
depending, it might be propo&s;ed to enact, that the &s;aid
militia &s;hould be exerci&s;ed on the Lord's day, commonly
called Sunday, and praying that no clau&s;e for &s;uch pur|po&s;e
might pa&s;s into a law. Though nothing could be
more ridiculou&s;ly fanatie and impertinent than the declara|tion
of &s;uch a &s;cruple again&s;t a practice &s;o laudable and
nece&s;&s;ary, in a country where that day of the week is ge|nerally
&s;pent in merry-making, riot, and debauchery,
the Hou&s;e paid &s;o much regard to the &s;queami&s;h con&s;ciences
of tho&s;e puritanical petitioners, that Monday was pitched
upon for the day of exerci&s;e to the militia, though on &s;uch
working days they might be much more profitably employ|ed,
both for them&s;elves and their country; and that no re|ligious
pretence &s;hould be left for oppo&s;ing the progre&s;s
and execution of the bill, proper clau&s;es were in&s;erted for
the relief of the quakers. Another petition and counter-petition
were delivered by the magi&s;trates, freeholders, and
<PB N="43" REF="45">
burge&s;&s;es of the town of Nottingham, in relation to their
particular franchi&s;es, which were accordingly con&s;idered
in framing the bill.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. After mature deliberation, and divers altera|tions,
it pa&s;&s;ed the Lower-Hou&s;e, and was &s;ent to the
Lords for their concurrence: here it underwent &s;everal
amendments, one of which was the reduction of the num|ber
of militia-men to one half of what the Commons had
propo&s;ed; namely, to thirty-two thou&s;and three hundred
and forty-men for the whole kingdom of England and
Wales. The amendments being canva&s;&s;ed in the Lower
Hou&s;e, met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition, and divers conferences
with their lord&s;hips en&s;ued: at length, however, the two
Hou&s;es agreed to every article, and the bill &s;oon received
the royal &s;anction. No provi&s;ion, however, was made for
clothes, arms, accoutrements, and pay: had regulations
been made for the&s;e purpo&s;es, the act would have become
a money-bill, in which the Lords could have made no
amendment: in order, therefore, to prevent any differ|ence
between the two Hou&s;es, on a di&s;pute of privileges
not yet determined, and that the Hou&s;e of Peers might
make what amendments they &s;hould think expedient, the
Commons left the expen&s;e of the militia to be regulated in
a &s;ub&s;equent bill, during the following &s;e&s;&s;ion, when they
could with more certainty compute what &s;um would be
nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e purpo&s;es. After all, the bill &s;eemed to
be crude, imperfect and ine$$$ctual, and the promoters of
it were well aware of its defects; but they were apprehen|&s;ive
that it would have been dropped altogether, had
they in&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;cheme's being executed in its full
extent. They were eager to &s;ei&s;e this opportunity of try|ing
an experiment, which might afterwards be improved
to a greater national advantage; and, therefore, they ac|quie&s;ced
in many re&s;trctions and alterations, which
otherwi&s;e would not have been adopted.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. The next mea&s;ure that fell under the con&s;i|deration
of the Hou&s;e was rendered nece&s;&s;ary by the in|ho&s;pitable
per&s;everance of the publicans and inn-holders,
<PB N="44" REF="46">
who conceived them&s;elves not obliged by law to receive o$
give quarters in their hou&s;es to any foreign troops, and
accordingly refu&s;ed admittance to the He&s;&s;ian auxiliaries,
who began to be dreadfully incommoded by the &s;everity of
the weather. This objection implying an attack upon the
prerogative, the government did not think fit, at this
juncture, to di&s;pute any other way, than by procuring a
new law in favour of tho&s;e foreigners. It was intituled,
&startq;A bill to make provi&s;ion for quartering the foreign
troops now in this kingdom,&endq; prepared by Lord Bar|rington,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Sollici|tor-General,
and immediately pa&s;&s;ed without oppo&s;ition.
This &s;tep being taken, another bill was brought in, for the
regulation of the marine-forces while on &s;hore. This was
almo&s;t a tran&s;cript of the mutiny act, with this material
difference: it empowered the Admiralty to grant com|mi&s;&s;ions
for holding general courts-martial, and to do
every thing, and in the &s;ame manner, as his Maje&s;ty is
empowered to do by the u&s;ual mutiny-bill; con&s;equently,
every clau&s;e was adopted without que&s;tion.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The &s;ame favourable reception was given to a
bill for the more &s;peedy and effectual recruiting his Maje&s;|ty's
land forces and marines; a law which threw into the
hands of many worthle&s;s magi&s;trates an additional power of
oppre&s;&s;ing their fellow creatures: all ju&s;tices of the peace,
commi&s;&s;ioners for the land-tax, magi&s;trates of corporations
and boroughs, were empowered to meet by direction of
the Secretary at War, communicated in precepts i&s;&s;ued by
the high &s;heriffs, or their deputies, within their re&s;pective
divi&s;ions, and at their u&s;ual place of meeting, to qualify
them&s;elves for the execution of the act: then they were
required to appoint the times and places for their &s;ucceeding
meetings; to i&s;&s;ue precepts to the proper officers for the&s;e
&s;ucceeding meetings; and to give notice of the time and
place of every meeting to &s;uch military officer, as, by notice
from the Secretary at War, &s;hould be directed to attend
that &s;ervice. The annual bill for preventing mutiny and
<PB N="45" REF="47">
de&s;ertion met with no objections, and indeed contained
nothing e&s;&s;entially different from that which had pa&s;&s;ed in
the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion. The next law enacted was for further pre|venting
embezzlement of goods and apparel by tho&s;e with
whom they are entru&s;ted, and putting a &s;top to the practice
of gaming in publick hou&s;es. By this bill a penalty was
inflicted on pawnbrokers, in a &s;ummary way, for receiving
goods, knowing them not to be the property of the pledger,
and pawned without the authority of the owner<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It was enacted, that per&s;ons pawning, exchanging, or di&s;po&s;ing of goods, without leave of the owner, &s;hould &s;uffer in the penalty of twenty &s;hillings; and, on non-payment, be committed for fourteen days to hard labour; after|wards, if the money could not then be paid, to be whipped publickly in the hou&s;e of correction, or &s;uch other place as the ju&s;tice of the peace &s;hould appoint, on publication of the pro&s;ecutor: that every pawnbroker &s;hould make entry of the per&s;on's name and place of abode who pledges any goods with him; and the pledger, if he required it, &s;hould have a duplicate of that entry: that a pawnbroker, receiving linen or apparel entru&s;ted to others to be wa&s;hed or mended, &s;hould forfeit double the &s;um lent upon it, and re&s;tore the goods: that upon oath of any per&s;on who&s;e goods are unlawfully pawned or exchanged, the ju&s;tice &s;hould i&s;&s;ue a warrant to &s;earch the &s;u&s;pected per&s;on's hou&s;e; and upon refu&s;al of admittance the officer might break open the door: that goods pawned for any &s;um not exceeding ten pounds might be recovered within two years, the owner making oath of the pawning, and tendering the principal, intere&s;t, and charges: that goods remaining unredeemed for two years &s;hould be forfeited and &s;old, the overplus to be accounted for to the owner on demand.</NOTE>. With
re&s;pect to gaming, the act ordained, that all publicans
&s;uffering journeymen, labourers, &s;ervants, or apprentices to
game with cards, dice, &s;huffle-boards, mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, or billiard
tables, &s;kittles, nine-pins, &amp;c. &s;hould forfeit forty &s;hillings
for the fir&s;t offence, and for every &s;ub&s;equent offence ten
pounds &s;hall be levied by di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. Divers inconveniencies having re&s;ulted from
the interpo&s;ition of ju&s;tices, who, in pur&s;uance of an act
of parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ent reign, a&s;&s;umed the right
of e&s;tabli&s;hing rates for the payment of wages to weavers,
&s;everal petitions were offered to the Hou&s;e of Commons,
repre&s;enting the evil con&s;equences of &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment;
and although the&s;e arguments were an&s;wered and
oppo&s;ed in counter-petitions, the Commons, actuated by
a laudable concern for the intere&s;t of the woollen manu|facture,
<PB N="46" REF="48">
after due deliberation, removed the grievance by a
new bill, repealing &s;o much of the former act as empower|ed
ju&s;tices of the peace to make rates for the payment of
wages<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It likewi&s;e imported, that all contracts or agreements made betwee$ clothiers and weavers, in re&s;pect to wages, &s;hould, from and after the $word$ May, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;even, be valid, $word$ with&s;tanding any rate e&s;tabli&s;hed, or to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, but that the&s;e $word$ or agreements &s;hould extend only to the actual prices or rates of wor$$ man&s;hip or wages, and not the payment thereof in any other manner than money: and that if any clothier &s;hould refu&s;e or neglect to pay the weavere$$ wages or price agreed on, in money, within two days after the work &s;hould$ performed and delivered, the &s;ame being demanded, &s;hould forfeit $word$ &s;hillings for every &s;uch offence.</NOTE>.&mdash;The Commons were not more forward to
provide &s;upplies for pro&s;ecuting the war with vigour, that
ready to adopt new regulations for the advantage of trade
and manufactures. The &s;ociety of the free Briti&s;h fi&s;hery
pre&s;ented a petition, alledging, that they had employed the
&s;um of one hundred thirty thou&s;and three hundred and five
pounds, eight &s;hillings, and &s;ix-pence, together with the
entire produce of their fi&s;h, and all the monies ari&s;ing fro$
the &s;everal branches allowed on the tonnage of their &s;hip$ping,
and on the exportation of their fi&s;h, in carrying o$
the &s;aid fi&s;hery; and that, from their being obliged, in the
infancy of the undertaking, to incur a much larger expen&s;$
than was at that time fore&s;een, they now found them&s;elve$
&s;o far reduced in their capital, as to be utterly incapable o
further pro&s;ecuting the fi&s;heries with any hope of &s;ucce&s;s
unle&s;s indulged with the further a&s;&s;i&s;tance of parliament
They prayed, therefore, that, towards enabling them t$
carry on the &s;aid fi&s;heries, they might have liberty to mak$
u&s;e of &s;uch nets as they &s;hould find be&s;t adapted to the &s;ai$
fi&s;heries; each bu&s;s, neverthele&s;s, carrying to &s;ea the &s;am$
quantity and depth of netting, which, by the fi&s;hery acts
they were then bound to carry: that the bounty of thirty
&s;hillings per ton, allowed by the &s;aid acts on the ve&s;&s;els em|ployed
in the fi&s;hery, might be increa&s;ed; and for as muc$
as many of the &s;tock-proprietors were unable to advance
any further &s;um for pro&s;ecuting this branch of commerce
and other unwilling, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and under
<PB N="47" REF="49">
the pre&s;ent re&s;traints, to ri&s;que any further &s;um in the
undertaking, that the &s;tock of the &s;ociety, by the &s;aid acts
made unalienable, except in ca&s;e of death or bankruptey,
for a term of years, might forthwith be made transferable;
and that the petitioners might be at liberty, between the
intervals of the fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;ons, to employ the bu&s;&s;es in &s;uch
a manner as they &s;hould find for the advantage of the
&s;ociety. While the committee was employed in deliber|ating
on the particulars of this remon&s;trance, another was
delivered from the free Briti&s;h fi&s;hery-chamber of White|haven
in Cumberland, repre&s;enting, that as the law then
&s;tood, they went to Shetland, and returned at a great ex|pen&s;e
and lo&s;s of time; and while the war continued dur&s;t
not &s;tay there to fi&s;h, be&s;ides being obliged to run the mo&s;t
imminent ri&s;ques, by going and returning without convoy:
that, ever &s;ince the in&s;titution of the pre&s;ent fi&s;hery, ex|perience
had fully &s;hown the fi&s;hery of Shetland not worth
following, as thereby the petitioners had lo&s;t two months
of a much better fi&s;hery in St. George's channel, within
one day's &s;ale of Whitehaven: they took notice, that the
free Briti&s;h fi&s;hery &s;ociety had applied to the Hou&s;e for
further a&s;&s;i&s;tance and relief; and prayed that Campbel|town,
in Argyle&s;hire, might be appointed the place of ren|dezvous
for the bu&s;&s;es belonging to Whitehaven, for the
&s;ummer as well as the winter fi&s;hery, that they might be
enabled to fi&s;h with greater advantage. The committee,
having con&s;idered the matter of both petitions, were of
opinion that the petitioners &s;hould be at liberty to u&s;e
&s;uch nets as they &s;hould find be&s;t adapted to the white
herring fi&s;hery: that the bounty of thirty &s;hillings per ton
&s;hould be augmented to fifty: that the petitioners &s;hould be
allowed, during the intervals of the fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;ons, to em|ploy
their ve&s;&s;els in any other lawful bu&s;ine&s;s, provided
they &s;hould have been employed in the herring-fi&s;hery during
the proper &s;ea&s;ons: that they might u&s;e &s;uch barrels for
packing the fi&s;h as they then u&s;ed, or might thereafter find
be&s;t adapted for that purpo&s;e: that they &s;hould have liberty
to make u&s;e of any wa&s;te or uncultivated land, one hundred
<PB N="48" REF="50">
yards at the lea&s;t above high-water mark, for the purpo&s;e
or drying their nets; and that Campbel-town would be
the mo&s;t proper and convenient place for the rendezvous of
the bu&s;&s;es belonging to Whitehaven. This la&s;t re&s;olution,
however, was not in&s;erted in the bill which contained the
other five, and in a little time received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. Such are the connexions, dependencies, and
relations &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the mechanical arts, agriculture,
and manufactures of Great-Britain, that it requires &s;tudy,
deliberation, and enquiry in the legi&s;tature to di&s;cern and
di&s;tingui&s;h the whole &s;cope and con&s;equences of many pro|jects
offered for the benefit of the commonwealth. The
&s;ociety of merchant adventurers in the city of Bri&s;tol
alledged, in a petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons, that
great quantities of bar iron were imported into Great-Bri|tain
from Sweden, Ru&s;&s;ia, and other parts, chiefly pur|cha&s;ed
with ready money, &s;ome of which iron was exported
again to Africa and other places; and the re&s;t wrought up
by the manufacturers. They affirmed that bar iron, im|ported
from North-America, would an&s;wer the &s;ame pur|po&s;es;
and the importation of it tend not only to the great
advantage of the kingdom, by increa&s;ing its &s;hipping and
navigation; but al&s;o to the benefit of the Briti&s;h colonies:
that, by an act pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty-third year of his pre&s;ent
Maje&s;ty's reign, the importation of bar iron from America
into the port of London, duty free, was permitted: but its
being carried coa&s;tways, or farther by land than ten miles,
had been prohibited; &s;o that &s;everal very con&s;iderable
manufacturing towns were deprived of the u&s;e of American
iron, and the out-ports prevented from employing it in their
export commerce: they reque&s;ted, therefore, that bar iron
might be imported from North-American into Great-Britain,
duty free, by all his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects. This reque&s;t being
re-enforced by many other petitions from different parts of
the kingdom, other cla&s;&s;es of men, who thought their &s;everal
intere&s;ts would be affected by &s;uch a mea&s;ure, took the
alarm; and in divers counter petitions &s;pecified many ill
con&s;equences which they alledged would ari&s;e from i$
<PB N="49" REF="51">
being enacted into a law. Pamphlets were publi&s;hed on
both &s;ides of the que&s;tion, and violent di&s;putes were kind|led
upon this &s;ubject, which was ju&s;tly deemed a matter of
national importance. The oppo&s;ers of the bill ob&s;erved,
that large quantities of iron were yearly produced at home,
and employed multitudes of poor people, there being no
le&s;s than one hundred and nine forges in England and
Wales, be&s;ides tho&s;e erected in Scotland, the whole pro|ducing
eighteen thou&s;and tons of iron: that as the mines
in Great Britain are inexhau&s;tible, the produce would of
late years have been con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, had not the
people been kept under continual apprehen&s;ion of &s;eeing
American iron admitted duty free: a &s;uppo&s;ition which
had prevented the traders from extending their works, and
di&s;couraged many from engaging in this branch of traffick:
they alledged that the iron works already carried on in Eng|land
occa&s;ioned a con&s;umption of one hundred and ninety-eight
thou&s;and cords of wood, produced in coppices that
grow upon barren lands, which could not otherwi&s;e be
turned to any good account: that as the coppices afford
&s;hade, and pre&s;erve a moi&s;ture in the ground, the pa&s;ture is
more valuable with the wood than it would be if the cop|pices
were grubbed up; con&s;equently all the e&s;tates where
the&s;e now grow would &s;ink in their yearly value: that the&s;e
coppices, now cultivated and pre&s;erved for the u&s;e of the
iron works, are likewi&s;e ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the manu|facture
of leather, as they furni&s;h bark for the tanners;
and that, according to the management of the&s;e coppices,
they produced a great number of timber trees, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary
for the purpo&s;es of building. They a&s;&s;erted that neither the
American iron, nor any that had yet been found in Great
Britain, was &s;o proper for converting into &s;teel as that
which comes from Sweden, particularly that &s;ort called ore
ground; but as there are mines in the northern parts of
Britain, nearly in the &s;ame latitude with tho&s;e of Sweden,
furni&s;hed with &s;ufficient quantities of wood, and rivers for
mills and engines, it was hardly to be doubted but that
people would find metal of the &s;ame quality, and, in a few
<PB N="50" REF="52">
years, be able to prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of importing iron
either from Sweden or Ru&s;&s;ia. They inferred that Ame|rican
iron could never interfere with that which Great
Britain imported from Sweden, becau&s;e it was not fit for
edge-tools, anchors, chain-plates, and other particulars
nece&s;&s;ary in &s;hip-building; nor dimini&s;h the importation
of Ru&s;&s;ian iron, which was not only harder than the Ame|rican
and Briti&s;h, but al&s;o could be afforded cheaper than
that brought from our own plantations, even though the
duty of this la&s;t &s;hould be removed. The importation of
American iron, therefore, duty free, could interfere with
no other &s;ort but that produced in Britain, with which, by
means of this advantage, it would cla&s;h &s;o much, as to
put a &s;top in a little time to all the iron works now carried
on in the kingdom, and reduce to beggary a great number
of families whom they &s;upport. To the&s;e objections the
favourers of the bill &s;ollicited replied, that when a manu|facture
is much more valuable than the rough materials,
and the&s;e cannot be produced at home in &s;ufficient quanti|ties,
and at &s;uch a price as is con&s;i&s;tent with the pre&s;er|vation
of the manufacture, it is the intere&s;t of the legi&s;|lature
to admit a free importation of the&s;e materials, even
from foreign countries, although it &s;hould put an end to
the production of that material in this i&s;land: that as the
neighbours of Great Britain are now more attentive than
ever to their commercial intere&s;ts, and endeavouring to
manufacture their rough materials at home, this nation
mu&s;t take every method for lowering the price of materials,
otherwi&s;e in a few years it will lo&s;e the manufacture; and,
in&s;tead of &s;upplying other countries, be furni&s;hed by them
with all the &s;ine toys and uten&s;ils made of &s;teel and iron:
that being in danger of lo&s;ing not only the manufacture
but the produce of iron, unle&s;s it can be procured at a
cheaper rate than that for which it is &s;old at pre&s;ent, the
only way of attaining this end, is by dimini&s;hing the duty
payable upon the importation of foreign iron, or by ren|dering
it nece&s;&s;ary for the undertakers of the iron mines in
Great Britain to &s;ell their produce cheaper than it has been
<PB N="51" REF="53">
for &s;ome years afforded: that the mo&s;t effectual method for
this purpo&s;e is to rai&s;e up a rival, by permitting a free im|portation
of all &s;orts of iron from the American plantations:
that American iron can never be &s;old &s;o cheap as that of
Britain can be afforded; for, in the colonies, labour of all
kinds is much dearer than in England: if a man employs
his own &s;laves, he mu&s;t reckon in his charge a great deal
more than the common intere&s;t of their purcha&s;e money,
becau&s;e when one of them dies, or e&s;capes from his ma&s;ter,
he lo&s;es both intere&s;t and principal: that the common in|tere&s;t
of money in the plantations is con&s;iderably higher
than in England, con&s;equently no man in that country
will employ his money in any branch of trade by which
he cannot gain con&s;iderably more per cent. than is expect|ed
in Great Britain, where the intere&s;t is low, and profit
moderate; a circum&s;tance which will always give a great
advantage to the Briti&s;h miner, who likewi&s;e enjoys an ex|emption
from freight and in&s;urance, which lie heavy upon
the American adventurer, e&s;pecially in time of war. With
re&s;pect to the apprehen&s;ion of the leather tanners, they
ob&s;erved, that as the coppices generally grew on barren
lands, not fit for tillage, and improved the pa&s;turage, no
proprietor would be at the expen&s;e of grubbing up the
wood to &s;poil the pa&s;ture, as he could make no other u&s;e
of the land on which it was produced. The wood mu&s;t
be always worth &s;omething, e&s;pecially in counties where
there is not plenty of coal, and the timber trees would pro|duce
con&s;iderable advantage: therefore, if there was not
one iron mine in Great Britain, no coppices would be
grubbed up, unle&s;s it grew on a rich &s;oil, which would pro|duce
corn in&s;tead of cord wood; con&s;equently, the tanners
have nothing to fear, e&s;pecially as planting hath become a
prevailing ta&s;te among the landholders of the i&s;land. The
committee appointed to prepare the bill &s;eriou&s;ly weighed
and canva&s;&s;ed the&s;e arguments, examined di&s;puted &s;acts,
and in&s;pected papers and accounts relating to the produce,
importation, and manufactory of iron. At length Mr.
John Pitt reported to the Hou&s;e their opinion, implying
<PB N="52" REF="54">
that the liberty granted by an act pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty-third
year of his Maje&s;ty's reign, of importing bar-iron
from the Briti&s;h colonies in America into the port of Lon|don,
&s;hould be extended to all the other ports of Great
Britain; and that &s;o much of that act as related to this
clau&s;e &s;hould be repealed. The Hou&s;e having agreed to
the&s;e re&s;olutions, and the bill being brought in accord|ingly,
another petition was pre&s;ented by &s;everal noblemen,
gentlemen, freeholders, and other proprietors, owners and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of coppices and woodlands, in the we&s;t-riding of
York&s;hire, alledging that a permi&s;&s;ion to import Ameri|can
bar-iron duty free would be attended with number|le&s;s
ill con&s;equences both of a public and private nature;
&s;pecifying certain hard&s;hips to which they in particular
would be expo&s;ed; and praying, that if the bill &s;hould pa&s;s
they might be relieved from the pre&s;&s;ure of an act pa&s;&s;ed
in the reign of Henry VIII. obliging the owners of cop|pice-woods
to pre&s;erve them, under &s;evere penalties; and
be permitted to &s;ell and grub up their coppice-woods, in
order to a more proper cultivation of the &s;oil, without
being re&s;trained by the fear of malicious and intere&s;ted
pro&s;ecutions. In con&s;equence of this remon&s;trance, a
clau&s;e was added to the bill, repealing &s;o much of the act
of Henry the Eighth as prohibited the conver&s;ion of cop|pice
or underwoods into pa&s;ture or tillage; then it pa&s;&s;ed
through both Hou&s;es, and received the royal &s;anction.
As there was not time, after this affair came upon the
carpet, to obtain any new accounts from America, and as
it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to know the quantities of iron
made in that country, the Hou&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to
his Maje&s;ty, de&s;iring he would be plea&s;ed to give directions
that there &s;hould be laid before them, in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion
of parliament, an account of the quantity of iron made
in the American colonies, from Chri&s;tmas, in the year one
thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-nine, to the fifth day
of January, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and
fifty-&s;ix, each year being di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55">
&sect; XXXIII. From this important object, the parliament
converted its attention to a regulation of a much more
private nature. In con&s;equence of a petition by the lord-mayor,
aldermen, and commons of the city of London, a
bill was brought in, and pa&s;&s;ed into a law without oppo&s;i|tion,
for the more effectual pre&s;ervation and improvement
of the fry and &s;pawn of fi&s;h in the river Thames and waters
of Medway, and for the better regulating the fi&s;hery in
tho&s;e rivers. The two next mea&s;ures taken for the benefit
of the publick were, fir&s;t, a bill to render more effectual
the &s;everal laws then in being, for the amendment and pre|&s;ervation
of the highways and turnpike roads of the king|dom;
the other for the more effectually preventing the
&s;preading of the contagious di&s;temper which at that time
raged among the horned cattle. A third aro&s;e from the
di&s;tre&s;s of poor &s;ilk manufacturers, who were de&s;titute of
employment, and deprived of all means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting,
through the interruption of the Levant trade, occa&s;ioned
by the war, and the delay of the merchant &s;hips from Italy.
In order to remedy this inconvenience, a bill was prepared,
enacting that any per&s;ons might import from any place, in
any &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el what&s;oever, till the fir&s;t day of Decem|ber,
one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;even, organzine
thrown &s;ilk of the growth or production of Italy, to be
brought to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e of London, where&s;oever
landed: but that no Italian thrown &s;ilk, coar&s;er than Bo|logna,
nor any tram of the growth of Italy; nor any
other thrown &s;ilk of the growth or production of Turkey,
Per&s;ia, Ea&s;t-India, or China, &s;hould be imported by this
act, under the penalty of the forfeiture thereof. Not|with&s;tanding
&s;everal petitions pre&s;ented by the merchants,
owners, and commanders of &s;hips, and others trading to
Leghorn, and other ports of Italy; as well as by the im|porters
and manufacturers of raw &s;ilks, repre&s;enting the
evil con&s;equences that would probably attend the pa&s;&s;ing
of &s;uch a bill, the parliament agreed to this temporary
deviation from the famous act of navigation, for a pre|&s;ent
&s;upply to the poor manufacturers.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="56">
&sect; XXXIV. The next civil regulation e&s;tabli&s;hed in this
&s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was in it&s;elf judicious, and, had it
been more eagerly &s;ugge&s;ted, might have been much more
beneficial to the publick. In order to di&s;courage the prac|tice
of &s;muggling, and prevent the de&s;peradoes concerned
therein from inli&s;ting in the &s;ervice of the enemy, a law
was pa&s;&s;ed, enacting, that every per&s;on who had been,
before the fir&s;t of May in the pre&s;ent year, guilty of ille|gal
running, concealing, receiving, or carrying any
wool, or prohibited goods, or any foreign commodities
liable to duties, the &s;ame not having being paid or &s;ecured;
or of aiding therein, or had been found with fire-arms or
weapons, in order to be aiding to &s;uch offenders; or had
been guilty of receiving &s;uch goods after &s;ei&s;ure; or of any
act what&s;oever, whereby per&s;ons might be deemed runners
of $oreign goods; or of hindering, wounding, or beating
any officer in the execution of his duty, or a&s;&s;i&s;ting therein,
&s;hould be indemni$ied from all &s;uch o$$ences, concerning
which no &s;uit &s;hould then have been commenced, or
compo&s;ition made, on condition that he &s;hould, before
being apprehended or pro&s;ecuted, and before the fir&s;t day
of December, enter him&s;elf with &s;ome commi&s;&s;ioned o$$i|cer
of his Maje&s;ty's fleet, to &s;erve as a common &s;ailor; and
&s;hould, for three years from &s;uch entry, unle&s;s &s;ooner
duely di&s;charged, actually &s;erve and do duty in that &s;tation,
and regi&s;ter his name, &amp;c. with the clerk of the peace of
the county where he re&s;ided, as the act pre&s;cribes. An
attempt was made in favour of the &s;eamen employed in the
navy, who had been very irregularly paid, and &s;ubject to
grievous hard&s;hips in con&s;equence of this irregularity. Mr.
Grenville, brother to Earl Temple, moved for leave to
bring in a bill $or the encouragement of &s;eamen employed
in his Maje&s;ty's navy, and for e&s;tabli&s;hing a regular me|thod
for the punctual, &s;peedy, and certain payment of their
wages, as well as for re&s;cuing them from the arts of fraud
and impo&s;ition. The propo&s;al was corroborated by divers
petitions: the bill was prepared, read, printed, and,
after it had undergone &s;ome amendment, pa&s;&s;ed into the
<PB N="55" REF="57">
Hou&s;e of Lords, where it was encountered with &s;everal
objections, and dropped for this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. The Hou&s;e of Commons being de&s;irous of
preventing for the future &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;es as the poor had
lately undergone, appointed a committee to con&s;ider of
proper provi&s;ions to re&s;train the price of corn and bread
within due bounds for the future. For this purpo&s;e they
were empowered to &s;end for per&s;ons, papers, and records,
and it was re&s;olved that all who attended the committee
&s;hould have voices. Having enquired into the cau&s;es of
the late &s;carcity, they agreed to &s;everal re&s;olutions, and a
bill was brought in, to explain and amend the laws again&s;t
regrators, fore&s;tallers, and engro&s;&s;ers of corn. The com|mittee
al&s;o received in&s;tructions to enquire into the abu&s;es
of millers, mealmen, and bakers, with regard to bread,
and to con&s;ider of proper methods to prevent them in the
&s;equel, but no further progre&s;s was made in this important
affair, which was the more intere&s;ting, as the lives of indi|viduals,
in a great mea&s;ure, depended upon a &s;peedy refor|mation;
for the millers and bakers were &s;aid to have
adulterated their flour with common whiting, lime, bone|a&s;hes,
allum, and other ingredients pernicious to the hu|man
con&s;titution; a con&s;ummation of villainy for which
no adequate puni&s;hment could be inflicted. Among the
mea&s;ures propo&s;ed in parliament which did not &s;ucceed,
one of the mo&s;t remarkable was a bill prepared by Mr.
Ro&s;e Fuller, Mr. Charles Town&s;hend, and Mr. Banks,
to explain, amend, and render more effectual a law pa&s;&s;ed
in the reign of King William the Third, intituled, &startq;An
act to puni&s;h governors of plantations, in this kingdom,
for crimes committed by them in the plantations.&endq;
This bill was propo&s;ed in con&s;equence of &s;ome complaints,
&s;pecifying acts of cruelty, folly, and oppre&s;&s;ion, by which
&s;ome Briti&s;h governors had been lately di&s;tingui&s;hed; but
before the bill could be brought in the parliament was
prorogued.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. But no &s;tep taken by the Hou&s;e of Commons,
in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was more intere&s;ting to the
<PB N="56" REF="58">
body of the people than the enquiry into the lo&s;s of Mi|norca, which had excited &s;uch loud and univer&s;al clamour.
By addre&s;&s;es to the King, unanimou&s;ly voted, the Com|mons
reque&s;ted that his Maje&s;ty would give directions for
laying before them copies of all the letters and papers con|taining
any intelligence received by the &s;ecretaries of
&s;tate, the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty, or any others of
his Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ters, in relation to the equipment of the
French fleet at Toulon, or the de&s;igns of the French on
Minorca, or any other of his Maje&s;ty's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Eu|rope,
&s;ince the fir&s;t day of January, in the year one thou|&s;and
&s;even hundred and fifty-five, to the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t,
1756. They likewi&s;e de&s;ired to peru&s;e a li&s;t of the &s;hips
of war that were equipped and made ready for &s;ea, from
the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and fifty-five, to the thirtieth day of April, in the follow|ing
year; with the copies of all &s;ailing orders &s;ent to the
commanders during that period; as al&s;o the &s;tate and con|dition
of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips in the &s;everal ports of Great-Britain
at the time of Admiral Byng's departure, with the
&s;quadron under his command, for the relief of Fort St.
Philip, during the period of time above-mentioned, ac|cording
to the monthly returns made to the Admiralty, with
the number of &s;eamen mu&s;tered and bor'n on board the re|&s;pective
&s;hips. They demanded copies of all orders and in|&s;tructions
given to that admiral, and of letters written to
and received from him, during his continuance in that
command, either by the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, or lords of the
Admiralty, relating to the condition of his &s;quadron, and
to the execution of his orders. In a word, they required
the in&s;pection of all papers which could, in any manner,
tend to explain the lo&s;s of Minorca, and the mi&s;carriage
of Mr. Byng's &s;quadron. His Maje&s;ty complied with every
article of their reque&s;ts: the papers were pre&s;ented to the
Hou&s;e, ordered to lie upon the table for the peru&s;al of the
members, and finally referred to the con&s;ideration of a
committee of the whole Hou&s;e. In the cour&s;e of their
deliberations they addre&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty for more informa|tion,
<PB N="57" REF="59">
till at length the truth &s;eemed to be &s;mothered under
&s;uch an enormous burthen of papers as the efforts of a
whole &s;e&s;&s;ion could not have properly removed. Indeed,
many di&s;cerning per&s;ons without doors began to de&s;pair of
&s;eeing the my&s;tery unfolded, as &s;oon as the enquiry was
undertaken by a committee of the whole Hou&s;e. They
ob&s;erved, that an affair of &s;uch a dark, intricate, and &s;u&s;|picious
nature ought to have been referred to a &s;elect and
&s;ecret committee, cho&s;en by ballot, empowered to &s;end for
per&s;ons, papers, and records, and to examine witne&s;&s;es in
the mo&s;t &s;olemn and deliberate manner: that the names of
the committee ought to have been publi&s;hed, for the &s;atis|faction
of the people, who could have judged with &s;ome
certainty whether the enquiry would be carried on with
&s;uch impartiality as the national misfortune required.
They &s;u&s;pected that this reference to a committee of the
whole Hou&s;e was a m&mdash;l contrivance, to prevent a regular
and minute inve&s;tigation, to introduce confu&s;ion and con|te&s;t,
to puzzle, perplex, and obumbrate; to tea&s;e, fatigue,
and di&s;gu&s;t the enquirers, that the examination might be
hurried over in a &s;uperficial and perfunctory manner; and
the mini&s;try, from this anarchy and confu&s;ion of materials,
half explored and undige&s;ted, derrive a general parliamen|tary
approbation, to which they might appeal from the
accu&s;ations of the people. A &s;elect committee would have
probably examined &s;ome of the clerks of the re&s;pective
offices, that they might certainly know whether any let|ters
or papers had been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, whether the extracts
had been faithfully made, and whether there might not be
papers of intelligence, which, though proper to be &s;ub|mitted
to a &s;elect and &s;ecret committee, could not, con|&s;i&s;tently
with the honour of the nation, be communicated
to a committee of the whole hou&s;e. Indeed, it does not
appear that the mini&s;ters had any foreign intelligence or
corre&s;pondence that could be much depended upon in any
matter of national importance, and no evidence was exa|mined
on this occa&s;ion; a circum&s;tance the le&s;s to be re|$retted,
as in times pa&s;t evil mini&s;ters have generally found
<PB N="58" REF="60">
means to render &s;uch enquiries ineffectual; and the &s;ame
arts would, at any rate, have operated with the &s;ame effi|cacy,
had a &s;ecret committee been employed at this junc|ture.
Be that as it may, &s;everal re&s;olutions were reported
from the committee, though &s;ome of them were not car|ried
by the majority without violent di&s;pute and &s;evere al|tercation.
The fir&s;t and la&s;t of their re&s;olutions require
particular notice. By the former, it appeared to the com|mittee,
that his Maje&s;ty, from the twenty-&s;eventh day of
Augu&s;t, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-five,
to the twentieth day of April in the &s;ucceeding year,
received &s;uch repeated and concurrent intelligence, as gave
ju&s;t rea&s;on to believe that the French King intended to
invade his dominions of Great Britain or Ireland. In the
latter they declared their opinion, that no greater number
of &s;hips of war could be &s;ent into the Mediterranean than
were actually &s;ent thither under the command of Admiral
Byng; nor any greater re-enforcement than the regiment
which was &s;ent, and the detachment, equal to a battalion,
which was ordered to the relief of Fort St. Philip, con&s;i&s;|tently
with the &s;tate of the navy, and the various &s;ervices
e&s;&s;ential to the &s;afety of his Maje&s;ty's dominions, and the
intere&s;ts of his &s;ubjects. It mu&s;t have been &s;omething more
powerful than ordinary conviction that &s;ugge&s;ted the&s;e
opinions. Whatever reports might have been circulated
by the French mini&s;try, in order to amu&s;e, intimidate,
and detach the attention of the Engli&s;h government from
America and the Mediterranean, where they really intended
to exert them&s;elves, yet the circum&s;tances of the two na|tions
being con&s;idered, one would think there could have
been no ju&s;t grounds to fear an inva&s;ion of Great-Britain
or Ireland, e&s;pecially when other intelligence &s;eemed to
point out much more probable &s;cenes of action. But the
la&s;t re&s;olution is &s;till more incomprehen&s;ible to tho&s;e who
know not exactly the ba&s;is on which it was rai&s;ed. The
number of &s;hips of war in actual commi&s;&s;ion amounted
to two hundred and fifty, having on board fifty-thou&s;and
&s;eamen and marines. Intelligence and repeated informa|tion
of the French de&s;ign upon Minorca had been con|veyed
<PB N="59" REF="61">
to the mini&s;try of England, about &s;ix months before
it was put in execution. Is it credible, that in all this
time the nation could not equip or &s;pare above eleven &s;hips
of the line and &s;ix frigates, to &s;ave the important i&s;land of
Minorca? Is it ea&s;y to conceive, that from a &s;tanding army
of fifty thou&s;and men one regiment of troops could not
have been detached to re-enforce a garri&s;on, well known
to be in&s;ufficient for the works it was de&s;tined to defend?
To per&s;ons of common intellects it appeared, that intelli|gence
of the armament at Toulon was conveyed to the Ad|miralty
as early as the month of September, in the year
one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-five, with expre&s;s no|tice
that it would con&s;i&s;t of twelve &s;hips of the line; that
the de&s;ign again&s;t Minorca was communicated as early
as the twenty-&s;eventh day of Augu&s;t, by Con&s;ul Banks, of
Carthagena; confirmed by letters from Con&s;ul Berttes, at
Genoa, dated on the &s;eventeenth and twenty-&s;ixth of Ja|nuary,
and received by Mr. Fox, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, on
the fourth and eleventh of February, as well as by many
&s;ub&s;equent intimations; that, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e re|peated
advices, even after ho&s;tilities had commenced in
Europe, when the garri&s;on of Minorca amounted to no more
than four incomplete regiments, and one company of ar|tillery,
forty-two officers being ab&s;ent, and the place other|wi&s;e
unprovided for a &s;iege, when the Mediterranean &s;qua|dron,
commanded by Mr. Edgecumbe, con&s;i&s;ted of two
&s;hips of the line, and five frigates; neither &s;tores, ammu|nition,
or provi&s;ion, the ab&s;ent officers belonging to the
garri&s;on, recruits for the regiments, though ready rai&s;ed,
miners, nor any additional troops, were &s;ent to the i&s;land,
nor the &s;quadron augmented, till Admiral Byng &s;ailed
from Spithead on the 6th day of April, with no more
&s;hips of the line than, by the mo&s;t early and authentick
intelligence, the government were informed would &s;ail
from Toulon, even when Mr. Byng &s;hould have been
joined by Commodore Edgecumbe; a junction upon which
no dependence ought to have been laid; that this &s;quadron
contained no troops but &s;uch as belonged to the four
<PB N="60" REF="62">
regiments in garri&s;on, except one battalion to &s;erve in the
fleet as marines, unle&s;s we include the order for another
to be embarked at Gibraltar, which order was neither
obeyed nor under&s;tood: that, con&s;idering the danger to
which Minorca was expo&s;ed, and the forwardne&s;s of the
enemy's preparations at Toulon, Admiral O&s;borne, with
thirteen &s;hips of the line and one frigate, who returned on
the &s;ixteenth of February, after having convoyed a fleet of
merchant-&s;hips, might have been detached to Minorca,
without hazarding the coa&s;t of Great-Britain; for at that
time, exclu&s;ive of this &s;quadron, there were eight &s;hips of
the line and thirty-two frigates ready manned, and thirty-two
&s;hips of the line and five frigates almo&s;t equipped:
that Admiral Hawke was &s;ent with fourteen &s;hips of the
line and one frigate to crui&s;e in the bay of Bi&s;cay, after
repeated intelligence had been received that the French
fleet had &s;ailed for the We&s;t-Indies, and the eleven &s;hips
remaining at Bre&s;t and Rochefort were in want of hands
and cannon, &s;o that they could never &s;erve to cover any
embarkation or de&s;cent, con&s;equently Mr. Hawke's &s;qua|dron
might have been &s;pared for the relief of Minorca: that,
in&s;tead of attending to this important object, the Admiralty
on the eighth day of March, &s;ent two &s;hips of the line and
three frigates to intercept a coa&s;ting convoy off Cape Bar|fleur:
on the eleventh of the &s;ame month they detached
two &s;hips of the line to the We&s;t-Indies, and on the nine|teenth
two more to North-America, where they could be
of little immediate &s;ervice; on the twenty-third two of the
line and three frigates a convoy-hunting off Cherbourg;
and on the fir&s;t of April $ive &s;hips of the line, including
three returned from this la&s;t &s;ervice, to re-enforce Sir Ed|ward
Hawke, already too &s;trong for the French fleet bound
to Canada: that all the&s;e &s;hips might have been added to
Mr. Byng's &s;quadron, without expo&s;ing Great-Britain or
Ireland to any hazard of inva&s;ion: that at length Mr.
Byng was detached with ten great &s;hips only, and even de|nied
a frigate to repeat &s;ignals, for which he petitioned; al|though
at that very time there were in port, exclu&s;ive of
<PB N="61" REF="63">
his &s;quadron, &s;eventeen &s;hips of the line and thirteen fri|gates
ready for &s;ea, be&s;ides eleven of the line and nine|teen
frigates almo&s;t equipped. From the&s;e and other
circum&s;tances, particulari&s;ed and urged with great vivacity,
many individuals inferred, that a greater number of &s;hips
might have been detached to the Mediterranean than were
actually &s;ent with Admiral Byng: that the not &s;ending
an earlier and &s;tronger force was one great cau&s;e of Mi|norca's
being lo&s;t, and co-operated with the delay of the
mini&s;try in &s;ending thither re-enforcements of troops, their
neglect in &s;uffering the officers of the garri&s;on to continue
ab&s;ent from their duty, and their omitting to give orders
for rai&s;ing miners to &s;erve in the fortre&s;s of Mahon.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. The next enquiry in which the Hou&s;e of
Commons engaged related to the contracts for victualling
the forces in America, which were &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome pa|triots
to be fraudulent and uncon&s;cionable. This &s;u&s;pi|cion
aro&s;e from an ambiguous expre&s;&s;ion, on which the
contractor being interrogated by the committee appointed
to examine the particulars, he prudently interpreted it in
&s;uch a manner as to &s;creen him&s;elf from the re&s;entment of
the legi&s;lature. The Hou&s;e, therefore, re&s;olved that the
contract entered into on the twenty-&s;ixth day of March,
in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;ix, by
the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury, with William Baker,
Chri&s;topher Kilby, and Richard Baker, of London, mer|chants,
for furni&s;hing provi&s;ions to the forces under the
command of the Earl of Loudoun, was prudent and nece&s;|&s;ary,
and properly adapted to the &s;ecuring a con&s;tant and
effectual &s;upply for tho&s;e forces in America.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion an addre&s;s had been
pre&s;ented to the King by the Hou&s;e of Commons, de&s;iring
his Maje&s;ty would give orders for laying before them &s;e|veral
papers relating to di&s;putes which had lately happened
between his Excellency Charles Knowles, E&s;q. and &s;ome
of the principal inhabitants of the i&s;land of Jamaica. This
governor was accu&s;ed of many illegal, cruel, and arbi|trary
acts, during the cour&s;e of his arbitration: but the&s;e
<PB N="62" REF="64">
imputations he incurred by an exertion of power which
was in it&s;elf laudable, and well intended for the commer|cial
intere&s;t of the i&s;land. This was his changing the &s;eat
of government, and procuring an act of a&s;&s;embly for re|moving
the &s;everal laws, records, books, papers, and wri|tings
belonging to &s;everal offices in that i&s;land, from Spa|ni&s;h-town
to King&s;ton; and for obliging the &s;everal offi|cers,
to keep their offices, and hold a &s;upreme court of ju|dicature,
at this la&s;t place, to which he had moved the &s;eat
of government. Spani&s;h-town, otherwi&s;e called St. Jago
de la Vega, the old capital, was an incon&s;iderable inland
place, of no &s;ecurity, trade, or importance; whereas,
King&s;ton was the centre of commerce, &s;ituated on the &s;ide
of a fine harbour filled with &s;hips, well &s;ecured from the
in&s;ults of an enemy, large, wealthy, and fouri&s;hing.
Here the merchants dwell, and &s;hip the greate&s;t part of
the &s;ugars that grow upon the i&s;land. They found it ex|tremely
inconvenient and expen&s;ive to take out their
clearances at Spani&s;h-town, which &s;tands at a con&s;iderable
di&s;tance, and the &s;ame inconvenience and expen&s;e being
felt by the re&s;t of the inhabitants, who had occa&s;ion to
pro&s;ecute &s;uits at law, or attend the a&s;&s;embly of the i&s;land,
they joined in repre&s;entations to the governor, reque&s;ting
that, in con&s;ideration of the&s;e inconveniencies, added to
that of the weakne&s;s of Spani&s;h-town and the importance
of King&s;ton, the &s;eat of government might be removed&punc;
He complied with their reque&s;t, and in &s;o doing entaile$
upon him&s;elf the hatred and re&s;entment of certai$
powerful planters, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed e&s;tates in and about th$
old town of St. Jago de la Vega, thus de&s;erted. Thi$
&s;eems to have been the real &s;ource of the animo&s;ity an$
clamour incurred by Mr. Knowles, again&s;t whom a peti$tion,
&s;igned by nineteen members of the a&s;&s;embly, ha$
been &s;ent to England, and pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty. $word$
the two &s;e&s;&s;ions preceding this year the affair had bee$
brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, where this gove$
nor's character was painted in frightful colours, and d$$vers
papers relating to the di&s;pute were examined. M$$
Knowles having by this time returned to England, th$
<PB N="63" REF="65">
&s;ubject of his admini&s;tration was revived, and referred to a
committee of the whole Hou&s;e. In the mean time, peti|tions
were pre&s;ented by &s;everal merchants of London and
Liverpool, concerned in the trade to Jamaica, alledging,
that the removal of the publick courts, offices, and re|cords
of the i&s;land of Jamaica to King&s;ton, and fixing the
&s;eat of government there, had been productive of many
important advantages, by rendering the &s;trength of the
i&s;land more formidable, the property of the traders and in|habitants
more &s;ecure, and the pro&s;ecution of all commer|cial
bu&s;ine&s;s more expeditious and le&s;s expen&s;ive than for|merly;
therefore, praying that the purpo&s;es of the act pa&s;|&s;ed
in Jamaica for that end might be carried into effectual
execution, in &s;uch manner as the Hou&s;e &s;hould think pro|per.
The committee having examined a great number of
papers, agreed to &s;ome re&s;olutions, importing, that a cer|tain
re&s;olution of the a&s;&s;embly of Jamaica, dated on the
twenty-ninth day of October, in the year one thou&s;and &s;e|ven
hundred and fifty-three, implying a claim of right in
that a&s;&s;embly to rai&s;e and apply publick money without the
con&s;ent of the governor and council, was illegal, repug|nant
to the terms of his Maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ion to his go|vernor
of the &s;aid i&s;land, and derogatory of the rights of
the crown and people of Great-Britain: that the &s;ix
la&s;t re&s;olutions taken in the a&s;&s;mbly of Jamaica, on the
twenty-ninth day of October, in the year one thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and fifty-three, proceeded one a manife&s;t
mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of the King's in&s;truction to his governor,
requiring him not to give his a&s;&s;ent to any bill of an unu|&s;ual
or extraordinary nature and importance, wherein
his Maje&s;ty's prerogative, or the property of his &s;ubjects,
might be prejudiced, or the trade of &s;hipping of the king|dom
any ways affected, unle&s;s there &s;hould be a clau&s;e in|&s;erted,
&s;u&s;pending the execution of &s;uch bill until his Ma|je&s;ty's
plea&s;ure &s;hould be known; that &s;uch in&s;truction
was ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary, and no alteration of the con&s;titution
of the i&s;land, nor any way derogatory to the rights of the
&s;ubjects in Jamaica. From the&s;e re&s;olutions the reader
may perceive the nature of the di&s;pute which had ari&s;en
<PB N="64" REF="66">
between the people of Jamaica and their governor, Vice-Admiral
Knowles, who&s;e conduct on this occa&s;ion &s;eems to
have been ju&s;tified by the legi&s;lature. The parliament,
however, forbore to determine the que&s;tion, whether the
removal of the courts of judicature from Spani&s;h-town $word$
King&s;ton was a mea&s;ure calculated for the intere&s;t of the
i&s;land in general.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The la&s;t &s;ubject which we &s;hall mention,
as having fallen under the cognizance of the Common
during this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, was the &s;tate of Mil$or$
haven on the coa&s;t of Wales, one of the mo&s;t capacious
&s;afe, and commodious harbours in Great-Britain. Here
the country affords many conveniences for building &s;hip
of war, and erecting forts, docks, quays, and magazine;
It might be fortified at a very &s;mall expen&s;e, &s;o as to be
quite &s;ecure from any attempts of the enemy, and ren|dered
by far the mo&s;t u&s;eful harbour in the kingdom fo$
fleets, crui&s;ers, trading &s;hips, and packet-boats, bound $word$
and from the we&s;tward, for from hence they may pu$
to &s;ea almo&s;t with any wind, and even at low wate$$
they may weather Scilly and Cape-Clear when no ve&s;&s;e$
can &s;tir from the Briti&s;h channel, or out of the Fren$
ports of Bre&s;t and Rochefort, and as a po&s;t can travel fro$
hence in three days to London, it might become the cent$
of very u&s;eful &s;ea intelligence. A petition from &s;even
merchants in London was pre&s;ented, and recommended $word$
the Hou&s;e in a me&s;&s;age from the King, &s;pecifying the ad$vantages
of this harbour, and the &s;mall expen&s;e at which$
might be fortified, and praying that the Hou&s;e would ta$
this important &s;ubject into con&s;ideration. Accordingl$
a committee was appointed for this purpo&s;e, wit$
power to &s;end for per&s;ons, papers, and records; an$
every circum&s;tance relating to it was examined with a$$curacy
and deliberation. At length the report being ma$
to the Hou&s;e by Mr. Charles Town&s;hend, they unan$$mou&s;ly
agreed to an addre&s;s, repre&s;enting to his Maje&s;t$
that many great lo&s;&s;es had been &s;u&s;tained by the tra$$
of the kingdom, in time of war, from the want of
&s;afe harbour on the we&s;tern coa&s;t of the i&s;land, $or $word$
<PB N="65" REF="67">
reception and protection of merchant &s;hips, and &s;ending
out crui&s;ers: that the harbour of Milford-haven, in the
county of Pembroke, is mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, and,
if properly defended and &s;ecured, in every re&s;pect adapted
to the an&s;wering tho&s;e important purpo&s;es: they, there|fore,
humbly be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty, that he would give
immediate directions for erecting batteries, with proper
cover, on the &s;ides of the &s;aid harbour, in the mo&s;t con|venient
places for guarding the entrance called Hubber|&s;tone-road,
and al&s;o &s;uch other fortifications as might be
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the interior parts of the harbour, and
that, until &s;uch batteries and fortifications could be com|pleted,
&s;ome temporary defence might be provided for the
immediate protection of the &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els lying in the
&s;aid harbour; finally, they a&s;&s;ured him the Hou&s;e would
make good to his Maje&s;ty all &s;uch expen&s;es as &s;hould be
incurred for the&s;e purpo&s;es. The addre&s;s met with a gra|cious
reception, and a promi&s;e that &s;uch directions &s;hould
be given. The harbour was actually &s;urveyed, the places
were pitched upon for batteries, and the e&s;timates pre|pared,
but no further progre&s;s hath &s;ince been made.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. We have now fini&s;hed the detail of all the ma|terial
tran&s;actions of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, except what relates to
the fate of Admiral Byng, which now claims our attention.
In the mean time, we may ob&s;erve, that on the fourth day
of July the &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed with his Maje&s;ty's harangue,
the mo&s;t remarkable and plea&s;ing paragraph of which
turned upon his royal a&s;&s;urance, that the &s;uccour and
pre&s;ervation of his dominions in America had been his
con&s;tant care, and, next to the &s;ecurity of his kingdoms,
&s;hould continue to be his great and principal object. He
told them he had taken &s;uch mea&s;ures as, he tru&s;ted, by
the ble&s;&s;ing of God, might effectually di&s;appoint the de|&s;igns
of the enemy in tho&s;e parts; that he had no further
view but to vindicate the ju&s;t rights of his crown and
&s;ubjects from the mo&s;t injurious encroachments; to pre|&s;erve
tranquillity, as far as the circum&s;tances of things
might admit; to prevent the true friends of Britain,
<PB N="66" REF="68">
and the liberties of Europe from being oppre&s;&s;ed and
endangered by any unprovoked and unnatural con|junction.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. Of all the tran&s;actions that di&s;tingui&s;hed this
year, the mo&s;t extraordinary was the &s;entence executed on
Admiral Byng, the &s;on of that great officer who had ac|quired
&s;uch honour by his naval exploits in the preceding
reign, and was ennobled for his &s;ervices, by the title of
Lord Vi&s;count Torrington. His &s;econd &s;on, John Byng,
had from his earlie&s;t youth been trained to his father's
profe&s;&s;ion; and was generally e&s;teemed one of the be&s;t o$$i|cers
in the navy, when he embarked in that expedition to
Minorca, which covered his character with di&s;grace, and
even expo&s;ed him to all the horrors of an ignominious
death. On the twenty-eighth day of December his trial
began before a court-martial, held on board the &s;hip St.
George, in the harbour of Port&s;mouth, to which place Mr.
Byng had been conveyed from Greenwich by a party of
hor&s;e-guards, and in&s;ulted by the populace in every town
and village through which he pa&s;&s;ed. The court having
proceeded to examine the evidences for the crown and the
pri&s;oner, from day to day, in the cour&s;e of a long &s;itting,
agreed unanimou&s;ly to thirty-&s;even re&s;olutions, implying
their opinion, that Admiral Byng, during the engagement
between the Briti&s;h and French fleets on the twentieth
day of May la&s;t, did not do his utmo&s;t endeavour to take,
&s;ei&s;e, and de&s;troy the &s;hips of the French King, which it
was his duty to have engaged, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;uch of his
Maje&s;ty's &s;hips as were engaged, which it was his duty to
have a&s;&s;i&s;ted; and that he did not exert his utmo&s;t power
for the relief of St. Philip's-ca&s;tle. They, therefore, una|nimou&s;ly
agreed, that he fell under part of the twelfth
article of an act of parliament pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty-&s;econd
year of the pre&s;ent reign, for amending, explaining, and
reducing into one act of parliament the laws relating to the
government of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips, ve&s;&s;els, and forces by
&s;ea; and as that article po&s;itively pre&s;cribed death, with|out
any alternative left to the di&s;cretion of the court under
<PB N="67" REF="69">
any variation of circum&s;tances, they unanimou&s;ly adjudged
the &s;aid Admiral John Byng to be &s;hot to death, at &s;uch
time and on board of &s;uch &s;hips as the lord commi&s;&s;ioners
of the Admiralty &s;hould plea&s;e to direct. But as it appear|ed,
by the evidence of the officers who were near the Ad|miral's
per&s;on, that no backwardne&s;s was perceivable in
him during the action, nor any mark of fear or confu&s;ion
either in his countenance or behaviour; but that he deli|vered
his orders coolly and di&s;tinctly, without &s;eeming de|ficient
in per&s;onal courage, and from other circum&s;tances
they believed his mi&s;conduct did not ari&s;e either from
cowardice or di&s;affection, they unanimou&s;ly and earne&s;tly
recommended him as a proper object of mercy. The
Admiral him&s;elf behaved through the whole tryal with
the mo&s;t chearful compo&s;ure, &s;eemingly the effect of con|&s;cious
innocence, upon which, perhaps, he too much
relied. Even after he had heard the evidence examined
again&s;t him, and fini&s;hed his own defence, he laid his
account in being honourably acquitted, and ordered his
coach to be ready for conveying him directly from the
tribunal to London. A gentleman, his friend, by whom
he was attended, having received intimation of the &s;en|tence
to be pronounced, thought it his duty to prepare
him for the occa&s;ion, that he might &s;ummon all his for|titude
to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and accordingly made him ac|quainted
with the information he had received. The Ad|miral
gave tokens of &s;urpri&s;e and re&s;entment, but be|trayed
no marks of fear or di&s;order either then or in the
court when the &s;entence was pronounced. On the con|trary,
while divers members of the court-martial manife&s;t|ed
grief, anxiety, and trepidation, &s;hedding tears, and
&s;ighing with extraordinary emotion, he heard his doom
denounced without undergoing the lea&s;t alteration of fea|ture,
and made a low obei&s;ance to the pre&s;ident and the
other members of the court as he retired.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. The officers who compo&s;ed this tribunal were
&s;o &s;en&s;ible of the law's &s;everity, that they unanimou&s;ly &s;ub|&s;cribed
a letter to the board of Admiralty, containing this
<PB N="68" REF="70">
remakable paragraph:&mdash;&startq;We cannot help laying the
di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our minds before your lord&s;hips on this occa|&s;ion,
in finding our&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity of condemn|ing
a man to death, from the great &s;everity of the twelfth
article of war, part of which he falls under, which ad|mits
of no mitigation if the crime &s;hould be committed
by an errour in judgement; and, therefore, for our own
con&s;ciences &s;ake, as well as in ju&s;tice to the pri&s;oner, we
pray your lord&s;hips, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, to
recommend him to his Maje&s;ty's clemency.&endq; The
lords of the Admiralty, in&s;tead of complying with the
reque&s;t of the court-martial, tran&s;mitted their letter to the
King, with copies of their proceedings, and a letter from
them&s;elves to his Maje&s;ty, &s;pecifying a doubt with regard
to the legality of the &s;entence, as the crime of negligence,
for which the Admiral had been condemned, was not ex|pre&s;&s;ed
in any part of the proceedings. At the &s;ame time,
copies of two petitions from George Lord Vi&s;count Tor|rington,
in behalf of his kin&s;man Admiral Byng, were
&s;ubmitted to his Maje&s;ty's royal wi&s;dom and determination.
All the friends and relations of the unhappy convict em|ployed
and exerted their in$$uence and intere&s;t for his
pardon; and as the circum&s;tances had appeared &s;o &s;trong
in his favour, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;ceptre of royal mer|cy
would be extended for this pre&s;ervation: but infamous
arts were u&s;ed to whet the &s;avage appetite of the populace
for blood. The cry of vengeance was loud throughout
the land: &s;ullen clouds of &s;u&s;picion and malevolence in|terpo&s;ing,
were &s;aid to ob&s;truct the genial beams of the
be&s;t virtue that adorns the throne; and the &s;&mdash;n was
given to under&s;tand that the execution of Admiral Byng
was a victim ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to appea&s;e the fury of the
people. His Maje&s;ty, in con&s;equence of the repre&s;enta|tion
made by the lords of the Admiralty, re$erred the &s;en|tence
to the con&s;ideration of the twelve judges, who were
unanimou&s;ly of opinion that the &s;entence was legal. This
report being tran&s;mitted from the privy-council to the Ad|miralty,
their lord&s;hips i&s;&s;ued a warrant $or executing the
<PB N="69" REF="71">
&s;entence of death on the twenty-eighth day of February.
One gentleman at the board, however, refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe
the warrant, a&s;&s;igning for his refu&s;al the rea&s;ons which
we have in&s;erted by way of note, for the &s;atisfaction of the
reader<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<OPENER>Admiral F&mdash;s's rea&s;ons for not &s;igning the warrant for Admiral Byng's execution:</OPENER>
<P>&startq;IT may be thought great pre&s;umption in me to differ from &s;o great autho|rity as that of the twelve judges; but when a man is called upon to &s;ign his name to an act which is to give authority to the &s;hedding of blood, he ought to be guided by his own con&s;cience, and not by the opinions of other men.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In the ca&s;e before us, it is not the merit of Admiral Byng that I con&s;ider: whether he de&s;erves death or not, is not a que&s;tion for me to decide; but whether or not his life can be taken away by the &s;entence pronounced on him by the court-martial, and after having &s;o clearly explained their motives for pronouncing &s;uch a &s;entence, is the point which alone has employed my mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The twelfth article of war, on which Admiral Byng's &s;entence is ground|ed, &s;ays (according to my under&s;tanding of its meaning) $That every per&s;on, who, in time of action, &s;hall withdraw, keep back, or not come into &s;ight, or do his utmo&s;t, &amp;c. through motives of cowardice, negligence, or di&s;affection, &s;hall &s;uffer death. The court-martial does, in expre&s;s words, acquit Adm$ral Byng of cowardice and di&s;affection, and does not name the word Negligence. Admiral Byng does not, as I conceive, fall under the letter or de&s;cription of he twelfth article of war. It may be &s;aid, that negligence is implied, though the word is not mentioned, otherwi&s;e the court-mart$al would not have brought his offence under the twelfth article, having acqui$ted him of cowardice and di&s;affection. But it mu&s;t be acknowledged that the negligence implied cannot be wilful negligence; for wilful negligence, in Admiral Byng's &s;ituation, mu&s;t have proceeded either from cowardice or di&s;affection, and he is e$pre&s;sly acquitted of both the&s;e crimes; be&s;ides, the&s;e crimes, which are im|plied only, and not named, may indeed ju&s;tify &s;u&s;picion and private opinion, but cannot &s;atisfy the con&s;cience in ca&s;e of blood.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Admiral Byng's fate was referred to a court-martial, his life and death were left to their opinions. The court-martial condemn him to death, be|cau&s;e, as they expre&s;sly &s;ay, they were under a nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;o by rea&s;on of the letter of the law, the &s;everity of which they complained of, becau&s;e $e admits of no mitigation. The court-martial expre&s;sly &s;ay, that for the &s;ake of their con&s;cience, as well as in ju&s;tice to the pri&s;oner, they mo&s;t earne&s;tly recommend him to his Maje&s;ty for mercy; it is evident, then, that in the opinions and con&s;ciences of the judges, he was not de&s;erving to death.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The que&s;tion then is, &s;hall the opinions or nece&s;&s;ities of the court-martial determine Admiral Byng's fate? if it &s;hould be the latter, he will be executed contrary to the intentions and meaning of his judges; if the former, his life is not forfeited. His judges declare him not de&s;erving of death; but, mi&s;taking either the meaning of the law, or the nature of his offence, they bring him under an article of war, which, according to their own de&s;cription of his offence, he does not, I conceive, fall under; and then they condemn him to death, becau&s;e, as they &s;ay, the law admits of no mitigation. Can a man's life be taken away by &s;uch a &s;entence! I would not willingly $word$ mi&s;under&s;tood, and have it believed that I judge of Admiral Byng's deferts: that was the bu&s;ine&s;s of a court-martial, and it is may duty only to act ac|cording to my con&s;cence; which, after deliberate con&s;ideration, affli&s;ted by the be&s;t light a poor under&s;tanding can afford it, remains &s;till in doubt, and there|fore I cannot con&s;ent to &s;ign a warrant whereby the &s;entence of the con$$ martial may be curried into execution; for I cannot help thinking, that how|ever criminal Admiral Byng may be, his life is not &s;or&s;eited by that &s;entence I do not mean to find fault with other men's opinions; all I endeavour at, $ to give rea&s;ons for my own; and all I de&s;ire or wi&s;h is, that I may not be mi&s;under&s;tood; I do not pretend to judge Admiral Byng's de&s;erts, nor to give any opinion on the propriety of the act.&endq;</P>

&sect; XLIII. Though mercy was denied to the criminal,
the crown &s;eemed determined to do nothing that &s;hould be
thought incon&s;i&s;tent with law. A member of parliament,
who had &s;at upon the court-martial at Port&s;mouth, ro&s;e up
in his place, and made application to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons
in behalf of him&s;elf and &s;everal other members of that
tribunal, praying the aid of the legi&s;lature, to be relea&s;ed
from the oath of &s;ecre&s;y impo&s;ed on courts-martial, that
they might di&s;clo&s;e the grounds on which &s;entence of death
had pa&s;&s;ed on Admiral Byng, and, perhaps, di&s;cover &s;uch
circum&s;tances as might &s;how the &s;entence to be improper.
Although this application produced no re&s;olution in the
Hou&s;e, the King, on the twenty-&s;ixth day of February,
&s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Commons by Mr. Secretary Pitt,
importing, that though he had determined to let the law
take its cour&s;e with relation to Admiral Byng, and re&s;i&s;ted
all &s;ollicitations to the contrary, yet, as a member of the
Hou&s;e had expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;cruples about the &s;entence, his
Maje&s;ty had thought fit to re&s;pite the execution of it, that
there might be an opportunity of knowing, by the &s;eparate
examination of the members of the court-martial, upon oath,
what grounds there were for &s;uch &s;cruples, and that his Ma|je&s;ty
was re&s;olved &s;till to let the &s;entence be carried into
execution, unle&s;s it &s;hould appear from the &s;aid examination,
<PB N="71" REF="73">
that Admiral Byng was unju&s;tly condemned. The &s;entence
mu&s;t be &s;trictly legal, and, at the &s;ame time, very &s;evere,
according to the maxim, <HI>&s;ummum jus, &s;umma injuria.</HI> In
&s;uch cau&s;es, and perhaps in &s;uch ca&s;es only, the rigour of
the law ought to be &s;oftened by the lenient hand of the
royal prerogative. That this was the ca&s;e of Admiral
Byng appears from the warm and eager interce&s;&s;ion of his
jury, a &s;pecies of interce&s;&s;ion which hath generally, if not
always, prevailed at the foot of the throne, when any thing
favourable for the criminal had appeared in the cour&s;e of
the trial. How much more then might it have been ex|pected
to &s;ucceed, when earne&s;tly urged as a ca&s;e of con|&s;cience,
in behalf of a man whom his judges had expre&s;sly
acquitted of cowardice and treachery, the only two impu|tations
that rendered him criminal in the eyes of the na|tion!
&s;uch an interpo&s;ition of the crown in parliamentary
tran&s;actions was irregular, unnece&s;&s;ary, and at another
juncture might have been productive of violent heats and
declamation. At pre&s;ent, however, it pa&s;&s;ed without cen|&s;ure,
as the effect of inattention, rather than a de&s;ign to
encroach upon the privileges of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. The me&s;&s;age being communicated, a bill was
immediately brought in, to relea&s;e the members of the
court-martial from the obligations of &s;ecre&s;y, and pa&s;&s;ed
through the Lower-Hou&s;e without oppo&s;ition: but in the
Hou&s;e of Lords it appeared to be de&s;titute of a proper
foundation. They &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Commons, de|&s;iring
them to give leave that &s;uch of the members of the
court-martial as were members of that Hou&s;e might
attend their lord&s;hips, in order to be examined on the &s;e|cond
reading of the bill; accordingly, they and the re&s;t
of the court-martial attended, and an&s;wered all que&s;tions
without he&s;itation. As they did not in&s;i&s;t upon any ex|cu&s;e,
nor produce any &s;atisfactory rea&s;on for &s;howing that
the man they had condemned was a proper object of mercy,
their lord&s;hips were of opinion that there was no occa|&s;ion
for pa&s;&s;ing any &s;uch bill, which, therefore, they
almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly rejected. It is not ea&s;y to conceive
what &s;tronger rea&s;ons could be given for proving Mr
<PB N="72" REF="74">
Byng an object of mercy than tho&s;e mentioned in the letter
&s;ent to the board of Admiralty by the members of the
court-martial, who were empowered to try the imputed
offence, con&s;equently mu&s;t have been deemed well quali|fied
to judge of his conduct.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. The unfortunate Admiral being thus aban|doned
to the &s;troke of ju&s;tice, prepared him&s;elf for death
with re&s;ignation and tranquillity. He maintained a &s;ur|pri&s;ing
chearfulne&s;s to the la&s;t, nor did he, from his con|demnation
to his execution, exhibit the lea&s;t &s;ign of impa|tience
or apprehen&s;ion. During that interval he had re|mained
on board of the Monarque, a third-rate &s;hip of
war, anchored in the harbour of Port&s;mouth, under a &s;trong
guard, in cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal of the Admiralty. On
the fourteenth of March, the day fixed for his execution, the
boats belonging to the &s;quadron at Spithead being manned
and armed, containing their captains and officers, with a de|tachment
of marines, attended this &s;olemnity in the har|bour,
which was al&s;o crowded with an infinite number of
other boats and ve&s;&s;els filled with &s;pectators. About noon
the Admiral having taken leave of a clergyman, and two
friends who accompanied him, walked out of the great
cabin to the quarter-deck, where two files of marines were
ready to execute the &s;entence. He advanced with a firm
deliberate &s;tep, a compo&s;ed and re&s;olute countenance, and
re&s;olved to &s;uffer with his face uncovered, until his friends
repre&s;enting that his looks would po&s;&s;ibly intimidate the
&s;oldiers, and prevent their taking aim properly, he &s;ubmit|ted
to their reque&s;t, threw his hat on the deck, kneeled on
a cu&s;hion, $ied one white handkerchief over his eyes, and
dropped the other as a &s;ignal for his executioners, who
fired a volley &s;o deci&s;ive, that five balls pa&s;&s;ed through his
body, and he dropped down dead in an in&s;tant. The time
in which this tragedy was acted, from his walking out of
the cabin to his being depo&s;ited in the co&s;&s;in, did not ex|ceed
three minutes.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVI. Thus fell, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all Europe,
Admiral John Byng, who, whatever his errours and indi&s;|cretions
might have been, &s;eems to have been ra&s;hly con|demned,
<PB N="73" REF="75">
meanly given up, and cruelly &s;acrificed to vile con|&s;iderations.
The &s;entiments of his own fate he avowed
on the verge of eternity, when there was no longer any
cau&s;e of di&s;&s;imulation, in the following declaration, which,
immediately before his death, he delivered to the mar&s;hal
of the Admiralty. &startq;A few moments will now deliver me
from the virulent per&s;ecution, and fru&s;trate the further
malice of my enemies. Nor need I envy them a life &s;ub|ject
to the &s;en&s;ations my injuries, and the inju&s;tice done
me, mu&s;t create; per&s;uaded I am that ju&s;tice will be done
to my reputation hereafter: the manner and cau&s;e of rai&s;ing
and keeping up the popular clamour and prejudice again&s;t
me will be &s;een through. I &s;hall be con&s;idered (as I now
perceive my&s;elf) a victim de&s;tined to divert the indignation
and re&s;entment of an injured and deluded people from the
proper objects. My enemies them&s;elves mu&s;t now think
me innocent. Happy for me, at this my la&s;t moment,
that I know my own innocence, and am con&s;cious that no
part of my country's misfortunes can be owing to me. I
heartily wi&s;h the &s;hedding my blood may contribute to the
happine&s;s and &s;ervice of my country, but cannot re&s;ign my
ju&s;t claim to a faithful di&s;charge of my duty according to
the be&s;t of my judgement, and the utmo&s;t exertion of my
ability for his Maje&s;ty's honour, and my country's &s;ervice.
I am &s;orry that my endeavours were not attended with
more &s;ucce&s;s, and that the armament under my command
proved too weak to &s;ucceed in an expedition of &s;uch mo|ment.
Truth has prevailed over calumny and fal&s;ehood,
and ju&s;tice has wiped off the ignominious &s;tain of my &s;up|po&s;ed
want of per&s;onal courage, and the charge of di&s;af|fection.
My heart acquits me of the&s;e crimes: but who
can be pre&s;umptuou&s;ly &s;ure of his own judgement? If my
crime is an error in judgement, or di&s;&s;ering in opinion from
my judges, and if yet the error in judgement &s;hould be on
their &s;ide, God forgive them, as I do, and may the di&s;tre&s;s
of their minds, and unea&s;ine&s;s of their con&s;ciences, which
in ju&s;tice to me they have repre&s;ented, be relieved, and &s;ub|&s;ide
as my re&s;entment has done. The Supreme Judge &s;ees
<PB N="74" REF="76">
all hearts and motives, and to him I mu&s;t &s;ubmit the ju&s;tice
of my cau&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&sect; XLVII. Nothwith&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid in
his favour, notwith&s;tanding the infamous arts that were
practi&s;ed to keep up the cry again&s;t him, notwith&s;tanding
this &s;olemn appeal to heaven in his la&s;t moments, and even
&s;elf-conviction of innocence, the character of Admiral
Byng, in point of per&s;onal courage, will &s;til with many
people remain problematical. They will &s;till be of opi|nion,
that if the &s;pirit of a Briti&s;h admiral had been pro|perly
exerted the French fleet would have been defeated,
and Minorca relieved. A man's opinion of danger varies
at different times, in con&s;equence of an irregular tide of
animal &s;pirits, and he is actuated by con&s;iderations which
he dares not avow. After an officer, thus influenced, ha$
he&s;itated or kept aloof in the hour of trial, the mind, eager
for its own ju&s;tification, a&s;&s;embles, with &s;urpri&s;ing indu&s;|try,
every favourable circum&s;tance of excu&s;e, and brood$
over them with parental partiality, until it becomes not
only &s;atisfied, but even enamoured of their beauty and
complexion, like a doating mother, blind to the deformity
of her own offspring. Whatever Mr. Byng's internal feel|ings
might have been, whatever con&s;equences might have
attended his behaviour on that occa&s;ion; as the tribuna$
before which he was tried acquitted him expre&s;sly of cow|ardice
and treachery, he was, without all doubt, a proper
object for royal clemency, and &s;o impartial po&s;terity will
judge him, after all tho&s;e di&s;honourable motives of faction
and of fear, by which his &s;ate was influenced, &s;hall be lo&s;t
in oblivion, or remembered with di&s;dain. The people of
Great Britain, naturally fierce, impatient, and clamorous,
have been too much indulged, upon every petty mi&s;car|riage,
with trials, courts-martials, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ions, which
tend only to render their military commanders ra&s;h and
precipitate, the populace more licentious and intractable,
and to di&s;grace the national character in the opinion of
mankind.</P>

<P>&sect; I. THOUGH the parliament of Great-Britain
unanimou&s;ly concurred in &s;trengthening the
hands of government, for avigorous pro&s;ecution of the war,
tho&s;e liberal &s;upplies had like to have proved ineffectual,
through a want of harmony in her councils. In the cour&s;e
of the la&s;t year the clamorous voice of di&s;&s;atisfaction had
been rai&s;ed by a &s;eries of di&s;appointements and mi&s;carriages,
which were imputed to want of intelligence, &s;agacity, and
vigour in the admini&s;tration. The defeat of Braddock, the
reduction of O&s;wego and other forts in America, the de|lay
of armaments, the neglect of opportunities, ineffectual
crui&s;es, ab&s;urd di&s;po&s;itions of fleets and &s;quadrons, the di&s;|grace
in the Mediterranean, and the lo&s;s of Minorca,
were numbered among the misfortunes that flowed from
the crude de&s;igns of a weak di&s;pirited mini&s;try; and the
pro&s;pect of their acquie&s;cing in a continental war brought
<PB N="77" REF="79">
them &s;till farther in contempt and dete&s;tation with the
body of the people.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VII.</NOTE> In order to conciliate the good-will
of tho&s;e whom their conduct had di&s;obliged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1757.</NOTE> to acquire a
fre&s;h &s;tock of credit with their fellow &s;ubjects, and remove
from their own &s;houlders part of what future cen&s;ure
might en&s;ue, they admitted into a &s;hare of the admini&s;|tration
a certain &s;et of gentlemen, remarkable for their
talents and popularity, headed by Mr. Pitt and Mr. Legge,
e&s;teemed the two mo&s;t illu&s;trious patriots of Great Bri|tain,
alike di&s;tingui&s;hed and admired for their unconquer|able
&s;pirit and untainted integrity. The former of the&s;e
was appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate, the other chancellor of
the Exchequer, and their friends were ve&s;ted with other
honorable though &s;ubordinate offices.</P>
<P>&sect; II. So far the people were charmed with the promotion
of individuals, upon who&s;e virtues and abilities they had
the mo&s;t perfect reliance: but the&s;e new ingredients would
never thoroughly mix with the old leven. The admini|&s;tration
became an emblem of the image that Nebuchad|nezzar
&s;aw in his dream, the leg was of iron, and the
foot was of clay. The old junto found their new a&s;&s;o|ciates
very unfit for their purpo&s;es. They could neither
per&s;uade, cajole, nor intimidate them into mea&s;ures which
they thought repugnant to the true intere&s;t of their coun|try.
The new mini&s;ters combated in council every &s;uch
plan, however patronized: they openly oppo&s;ed in parlia|ment
every de&s;ign which they deemed unworthy of the
crown, or prejudicial to the people, even though di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by the predilection of the &s;overeign. Far from
pargaining for their places, and &s;urrendering their princi|ples
by capitulation, they maintained in office their inde|pendency
and candour with the mo&s;t vigilant circum&s;pec|tion,
and &s;eemed determined to &s;how, that he is the be&s;t
mini&s;ter to the &s;overeign who acts with the greate&s;t probity
towards the &s;ubject. Tho&s;e who immediately &s;urrounded
the throne were &s;uppo&s;ed to have concealed the true cha|racters
of the&s;e faithful &s;ervants from the knowledge of
their royal ma&s;ter; to have repre&s;ented them as ob&s;tinate,
<PB N="78" REF="80">
imperious, ignorant, and even lukewarm in their loyalty;
and to have declared, that with &s;uch colleagues it would
be impo&s;&s;ible to move the machine of government accord|ing
to his Maje&s;ty's inclination. The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, art|fully
inculcated, produced the de&s;ired effect: on the ninth
day of April Mr. Pitt, by his Maje&s;ty's command, re&s;igned
the &s;eals of &s;ecretary of &s;tate for the &s;outhern department.
In the room of Mr. Legge, the King was plea&s;ed to grant
the office of chancellor of the Exchequer to the right
honorable Lord Mans$ield, chief ju&s;tice of the court of
King's-Bench, the &s;ame per&s;onage whom we have men|tioned
before under the name of Mr. Murray, &s;ollicitor-general,
now promoted and ennobled for his extraordi|nary
merit and important &s;ervices. The fate of Mr. Pitt
was extended to &s;ome of his principal friends: the board
of Admiralty was changed, and &s;ome other removals were
made with the &s;ame intention.</P>
<P>&sect; III. What was intended as a di&s;grace to Mr. Pitt and
Mr. Legge turned out one of the mo&s;t &s;hining circum|&s;tances
of their characters. The whole nation &s;eemed to
ri&s;e up, as one man, in the vindication of their fame:
every mouth was opened in their prai&s;e; and a great
number of re&s;pectable cities and corporations pre&s;ented
them with the freedom of their re&s;pective &s;ocieties, en|clo&s;ed
in gold boxes of curious workman&s;hip, as te&s;timo|nies
of their peculiar veneration. What the people highly
e&s;teem, they in a manner idolize. Not contented with
making offerings &s;o &s;lattering and grateful to con&s;cious
virtue, they conceived the mo&s;t violent prejudices again&s;t
tho&s;e gentlemen who &s;ucceeded in the admini&s;tration;
fully convinced, that the &s;ame per&s;ons who had &s;unk the
nation in the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances, who had
brought on her di&s;honour, and reduced her to the verge of
de&s;truction, were by no means the &s;it in&s;truments of he$
delivery and redemption. The whole kingdom catched
&s;ire at the late changes; nor could the power, the cunning
and the artifice of a &s;action long &s;upport it again&s;t th$
united voice of Great Britain, which &s;oon pierced the $word$
<PB N="79" REF="81">
of the &s;overeign. It was not po&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade the peo|ple
that &s;alutary mea&s;ures could be &s;ugge&s;ted or pur&s;ued,
except by the few, who&s;e zeal for the honour of their
country, and &s;teady adherence to an upright di&s;intere&s;ted
conduct, had &s;ecured their confidence, and claimed their
veneration. A great number of addre&s;&s;es, dutifully and
loyally expre&s;&s;ed, &s;ollicited the King, ever ready to meet
half way the wi&s;hes of his faithful people, to re&s;tore Mr.
Pitt and Mr. Legge to their former employments. Upon
this they re&s;ted the &s;ecurity and honour of the nation, as
well as the public expectation of the &s;peedy and &s;ucce&s;s|ful
i&s;&s;ue of a war, hitherto attended with di&s;graces and
misfortunes. Accordingly, his Maje&s;ty was graciou&s;ly
plea&s;ed to redeliver the &s;eals to Mr. Pitt, appointing him
&s;ecretary of &s;tate for the &s;outhern department, on the
twenty-ninth day of June; and five days after the office of
chancellor of the Exchequer was re&s;tored to Mr. Legge:
promotions that afforded univer&s;al &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. It would not, perhaps, be po&s;&s;ible to exclude
from a &s;hare in the admini&s;tration all who are not per|fectly
agreeable to the people: however unpopular the late
mini&s;try might appear, &s;till they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ufficient influ|ence
in the privy-council, and credit in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
to thwart every mea&s;ure in which they did not
them&s;elves partake. This con&s;ideration, and very recent
experience, probably dictated the nece&s;&s;ity of a coalition,
&s;alutary in it&s;elf and prudent, becau&s;e it was the only
means of a&s;&s;uaging the rage of faction, and healing tho&s;e
divi&s;ions, more pernicious to the public than the mo&s;t
mi&s;taken and blundering councils. Sir Robert Henley
was made lord-keeper of the great &s;eal, and &s;worn of
$is Maje&s;ty's privy-council, on the thirtieth day of June:
$he cu&s;tody of the privy-&s;eal was committed to Earl
Temple: his grace the Duke of Newca&s;tle, Mr. Legge,
Mr. Nugent, Lord Vi&s;count Dunca$$on, and Mr.
Grenville, were appointed commi&s;&s;ioners for executing
$he office of trea&s;urer of his Maje&s;ty's Exchequer: Lord
<PB N="80" REF="82">
An&s;on, Admirals Bo&s;cawen and Forbes, Dr. Hay, Mr.
We&s;t, Mr. Hunter, and Mr. Elliot, to pre&s;ide at the
board of Admiralty: Mr. Fox was gratified with the
office of receiver and payma&s;ter-general of all his Maje&s;ty's
guards, garri&s;ons, and land forces; and the Earl of Tho|mond
was made trea&s;urer of the King's hou&s;ehold, and
&s;worn of his Maje&s;ty's privy-council. Other promotions
likewi&s;e took place, with a de&s;ign to gratify the adherents
of either party; and &s;o equally was the royal favour di&s;|tributed,
that the utmo&s;t harmony for a long time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted.
Ingredients &s;eemingly heterogenous con&s;olidated into one
uniform ma&s;s, &s;o as to produce effects far exceeding the
mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations; and this prudent arrangement
proved di&s;plea&s;ing only to tho&s;e whom violent party attach|ment
had in&s;pired with a narrow and exclu&s;ive &s;pirit.</P>
<P>&sect; V. The accumulated lo&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments of
the preceding year made it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to retrieve
the credit of the Briti&s;h arms and councils by &s;ome vigo|rous
and &s;pirited enterpri&s;e, which &s;hould at the &s;ame time
produce &s;ome change in the circum&s;tances of his Pru&s;&s;ian
Maje&s;ty, already depre&s;&s;ed by the repul&s;e at Colin, and in
danger of being attacked by the whole power of France,
now ready to fall upon him, like a torrent, which had &s;o
lately &s;wept before it the army of ob&s;ervation, now on the
brink of di&s;grace. A well-planned and vigorous de&s;cent
on the coa&s;t of France, it was thought, would probably
give a deci&s;ive blow to the marine of that kingdom, and
at the &s;ame time effect a powerful diver&s;ion in favour of
the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch and the Duke of C&mdash;d, driven
from all his po&s;ts in the electorate of Hanover, by drawing
a part of the French forces to the defence and protection
of their own coa&s;ts. Both were objects of great concern,
upon which the &s;overeign and mini&s;try were &s;edulou&s;ly
bent. His royal highne&s;s the Duke in a particular manner
urged the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome enterpri&s;e of this nature, as the
only expedient to obviate the &s;hameful convention now in
agitation. The mini&s;try fore&s;aw, that, by de&s;troying the
enemy's &s;hipping, all &s;uccours would be cut off from
<PB N="81" REF="83">
America, whither they were daily tran&s;porting troops;
the Briti&s;h commerce &s;ecured, without tho&s;e convoys &s;o
inconvenient to the board of Admiralty, and to the mer|chants;
and tho&s;e ideal fears of an inva&s;ion, that had in
&s;ome mea&s;ure affected the publick credit, wholly di&s;|pelled.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. From the&s;e con&s;iderations a powerful fleet was
ordered to be got in readine&s;s to put to &s;ea on the &s;horte&s;t
notice, and ten regiments of foot were marched to the
I&s;le of Wight. The naval armament, con&s;i&s;ting of eigh|teen
&s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates, fire-&s;hips, bomb-ketches,
and tran&s;ports, was put under the command of
Sir Edward Hawke, an officer who&s;e faithful &s;ervices re|commended
him, above all others, to this command; and
Rear-Admiral Knowles was appointed his &s;ubaltern. Sir
John Mordaunt was preferred to take the command of the
land forces; and both &s;trictly enjoined to act with the ut|mo&s;t
unanimity and harmony. Europe beheld with a&s;to|ni&s;hment
the&s;e mighty preparations. The de&s;tination of
the armament was wrapped in the mo&s;t profound &s;ecre&s;y:
it exerci&s;ed the penetration of politicians, and filled
France with very &s;erious alarms. Various were the im|pediments
which ob&s;tructed the embarkation of the troops
for &s;everal weeks, while Mr. P&mdash;expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t
unea&s;ine&s;s at the delay, and repeatedly urged the com|mander
in chief to expedite his departure; but a &s;ufficient
number of tran&s;ports, owing to &s;ome blunder in the con|tractors,
had not yet arrived. The troops expre&s;&s;ed an eager
impatience to &s;ignalize them&s;elves again&s;t the enemies of
the liberties of Europe; but the &s;uper&s;titious drew unfa|vourable
pre&s;ages from the dilatorine&s;s of the embarka|tion.
At la&s;t the tran&s;ports arrived, the troops were put on
board with all expedition, and the &s;leet got under fail on
the eighth day of September, attended with the prayers of
every man warmed with the love of his country, and &s;ol|licitous
for her honour. The publick, big with expectation,
dubious where the &s;troke would &s;all, but con&s;ident of its
<PB N="82" REF="84">
&s;ucce&s;s, were impatient for tidings from the fleet; but it
was not till the fourteenth that even the troops on board
began to conjecture that a de&s;cent was meditated on the
coa&s;t of France near Rochefort or Rochelle.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. On the twentieth the fleet made the I&s;le of
Oleron, and then Sir Edward Hawke &s;ent an order to
Vice-Admiral Knowles, requiring him, if the wind per|mitted
the fleet, to proceed to Ba&s;que road, to &s;tand in as
near to the I&s;le of Aix as the pilot would carry him, with
&s;uch &s;hips of his divi&s;ion as he thought nece&s;&s;ary for the
&s;ervice, and to batter the fort till the garri&s;on &s;hould either
abandon or &s;urrender it. But the immediate execution of
this order was fru&s;trated by a French &s;hip of war's &s;tand|ing
into the very middle of the fleet, and continuing in
that &s;tation for &s;ome time before &s;he di&s;covered her mi&s;|take,
or any of the captains had a &s;ignal thrown out to
give cha&s;e. A&mdash;I K&mdash;les, when too late, ordered the
Magnanime, Captain Howe, and Torbay, Captain Kep|pel,
on that &s;ervice, and thereby retarded the attack upon
which he was immediately &s;ent. A &s;troke of policy great|ly
to be admired, as from hence he gained time to a&s;&s;ure
him&s;elf of the &s;trength of the fortifications of Aix, before
he ran his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips into danger.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. While the above &s;hips, with the addition of the
Royal William, were attending the French &s;hip of war
&s;afe into the river Garonne, the remainder of the fleet
was beating to windward off the I&s;le of Oleron; and the
commander in chief publi&s;hed orders and regulations
which did credit to his judgment, and would have been
highly u&s;eful had there ever been occa&s;ion to put them in
execution. On the twenty-third the van of the fleet, led
by Captain Howe in the Magnanime, &s;tood towards Aix,
a &s;mall i&s;land &s;ituated in the mouth of the river Charente,
leading up to Roche&s;ort, the fortifications half fini&s;hed,
and mounted with about thirty cannon and mortars, the
garri&s;on compo&s;ed of &s;ix hundred men, and the whole
i&s;land about five miles in circumference. As the Magna|nime
<PB N="83" REF="85">
approached, the enemy $ired bri&s;kly upon her; but
Captain Howe, regardle&s;s of their faint endeavours, kept
on his cour&s;e without flinching, dropped his anchors clo&s;e
to the walls, and poured in &s;o ince&s;&s;ant a fire as &s;oon
&s;ilenced their artillery. It was, however, near an hour
before the fort &s;truck, when &s;ome forces were landed to
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o important a conque&s;t, with orders to
demoli&s;h the fortifications, the care of which was entru&s;t|ed
to Vice-Admiral Knowles.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. Incon&s;iderable as this &s;ucce&s;s might appear, it
greatly elated the troops, and was deemed an happy omen
of further advantages; but, in&s;tead of embarking the troops
that night, as was univer&s;ally expected, &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
days were &s;pent in councils of war, &s;oundings of the coa&s;t,
and deliberations whether K&mdash;'s expre&s;s orders were
practicable, or to be complied with. Eight days were
elap&s;ed &s;ince the fir&s;t appearance of the fleet on the coa&s;t,
and the alarm was given to the enemy. Sir Edward
Hawke, indeed, propo&s;ed laying a &s;ixty gun &s;hip again&s;t
Fouras, and battering that fort, which it was thought
would help to &s;ecure the landing of the troops, and facili|tate
the enterpri&s;e on Rochefort. This a French pilot
on board (Thierry) undertook; but after a &s;hip had been
lighted for the purpo&s;e, Vice-Admiral Knowles reported
that a bomb-ketch had run a-ground at above the di&s;tance
of two miles from the fort; upon which the project of
battering or bombarding the fort was abandoned. The
admiral likewi&s;e propo&s;ed to bombard Rochelle; but this
overture was over-ruled, for rea&s;ons which we need not
mention. It was at length determined, in a council of
war held on the eighth, to make a de&s;cent, and attack
the &s;orts leading to and upon the mouth of the river Cha|rente.
An order, in con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, was
immediately i&s;&s;ued for the troops to be ready to embark
from the tran&s;ports in the boats preci&s;ely at twelve o'clock
at night. Accordingly, the boats were prepared, and filled
with the men at the time appointed, and now they
<PB N="84" REF="86">
remained beating again&s;t each other, and the &s;ides of the
&s;hips, for the &s;pace of four hours, while the council were
determining whether, after all the trouble given, they
&s;hould land; when at length an order was publi&s;hed for
the troops to return to their re&s;pective tran&s;ports, and all
thoughts of a de&s;cent, to appearance, were wholly aban|doned.
The &s;ucceeding days were employed in blowing
up and demoli&s;hing the fortifications of Aix; after which,
the land officers, in a council of war, took the final re&s;o|lution
of returning to England without any further at|tempts,
fully &s;atisfied they had done all in their power to
execute the de&s;igns of the mini&s;try, and choo&s;ing rather to
oppo&s;e the frowns of an angry &s;&mdash;, the murmurings of
an incen&s;ed nation, and the contempt of mankind, than
fight a handful of da&s;tardly militia. Such was the i&s;&s;ue
of an expedition that rai&s;ed the expectation of all Europe,
threw the coa&s;ts of France into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and
co&s;t the people of England little le&s;s than a million of
money.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The fleet was no &s;ooner returned than the whole
nation was in a ferment. The publick expectation had
been wound up to the highe&s;t pitch, and now the di&s;ap|pointment
was proportioned to the &s;anguine hopes con|ceived
that the pride of France would have been humbled
by &s;o formidable an armament. The mini&s;try, and with
them the national voice, exclaimed again&s;t the command|ing
officers, and the military men retorted the calumny,
by laying the blame on the projectors of the enterpri&s;e,
who had put the nation to great expen&s;e, before they had
obtained the nece&s;&s;ary information. Certain it was, that
blame mu&s;t fall &s;omewhere, and the mini&s;try re&s;olved to
acquit them&s;elves and $ix the accu&s;ation, by reque&s;ting his
Maje&s;ty to appoint a board of officers of character and
ability to enquire into the cau&s;es of the late mi&s;carriage.
This alone it was that could appea&s;e the publick clamours,
and afford general &s;atisfaction. The enemies of Mr. Pitt
endeavoured to wre&s;t the mi&s;carriage of the expedition to
<PB N="85" REF="87">
his prejudice, but the whi&s;pers of faction were &s;oon
drowned in the voice of the whole people of England, who
never could per&s;uade them&s;elves that a gentleman, rai&s;ed
to the height of power and popularity by mere dint of
&s;uperior merit, integrity, and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, would now
&s;acrifice his reputation by a mock armament, or hazard
incurring the deri&s;ion of Europe, by neglecting to obtain
all the nece&s;&s;ary previous information, or doing whatever
might contribute to the &s;ucce&s;s of the expedition. It was
a&s;ked whether rea&s;on or ju&s;tice dictated, that a late un|fortunate
admiral &s;hould be capitally puni&s;hed for not
trying and exerting his utmo&s;t ability to relieve Fort St.
Philip's, inve&s;ted by a powerful army, and &s;urrounded
with a numerous fleet, while no charge of negligence or
cowardice was brought again&s;t tho&s;e who occa&s;ioned the
mi&s;carriage of a well-concerted and well-appointed expe|dition?
The people, they &s;aid, were not to be quieted
with the re&s;olutions of a council of war, compo&s;ed of men,
who&s;e inactivity might frame excu&s;es for declining to ex|po&s;e
them&s;elves to danger. It was publickly mentioned,
that &s;uch backwardne&s;s appeared among the general offi|cers
before the fleet reached the i&s;le of Oleron as occa&s;ioned
the admiral to declare with warmth, that he would com|ply
with his orders, and go into Ba&s;que road, whatever
might be the con&s;equence. It was a&s;ked why the army
did not land on the night of the twenty-third or
twenty-fourth, and whether the officers &s;ent out to re|connoitre
had returned with &s;uch intelligence as &s;eemed
to render a de&s;cent impracticable? It was a&s;ked, whether
the commander in chief had complied with his Maje&s;ty's
orders, &startq;To attempt, as far as &s;hould be &s;ound practica|ble,
a de&s;cent on the coa&s;t of France, at or near Roche|fort,
in order to attack, and, by a vigorous impre&s;&s;ion,
force that place; and to burn and de&s;troy, to the utmo&s;t
of his power, all docks, magazines, ar&s;enals, and &s;hip|ping,
as &s;hall be found there?&endq; Such rumours as the&s;e,
every where propagated, rendered an enquiry no le&s;s ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="86" REF="88">
to the reputation of the officers on the expedition
than to the mini&s;ter who had projected it. Accordingly
a board, con&s;i&s;ting of three officers of rank, reputation,
and ability, was appointed by his Maje&s;ty to enquire into
the rea&s;ons why the fleet returned without having exe|cuted
his Maje&s;ty's orders.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. The three general officers who met on the
twenty-fir&s;t of the &s;ame month, were Charles, Duke of
Marlborough, lieutenant-general, Major-generals Lord
George Sackville and John Waldegrave. To judge of the
practicability of executing his Maje&s;ty's orders, it was
nece&s;&s;ary to enquire into the nature of the intelligence
upon which the expedition was projected. The fir&s;t and
mo&s;t important was a letter &s;ent to Sir John, afterwards
Lord Ligonier, by Lieutenant-Colonel Clark. This letter
had been frequently examined in the privy-council, and
contained in &s;ub&s;tance, That Colonel Clark, in returning
from Gibraltar, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and fifty-four, had travelled along the we&s;tern coa&s;t of
France, to ob&s;erve the condition of the fortifications, and
judge how far a de&s;cent would be practicable, in ca&s;e of a
rupture between Great-Britain and France. On his
coming to Rochefort, where he was attended by an en|gineer,
he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find the greate&s;t part of a good
rampart, with a revetement, $lanked only with redans; no
outworks, no covered-way, and in many places no ditch,
&s;o that the bottom of the wall was &s;een at a di&s;tance. He
remembered, that in other places, where the earth had
been taken out to form the rampart, there was left round
them a con&s;iderable height of ground, whence an enemy
might draw a great advantage: that for above the length
of a front, or two or three hundred yards, there was no
rampart, or even entrenchment, but only &s;mall ditches, in
the low and mar&s;hy grounds next the river, which however
were dry at low water; yet the bottom remained muddy
and &s;limy. Towards the river no rampart, no batteries,
no parapet, on either &s;ide appeared, and on the land &s;ide he
<PB N="87" REF="89">
ob&s;erved &s;ome high ground within the di&s;tance of one hun|dred
and fifty or two hundred yards of the town, in which
condition the Colonel was told by the engineer the place
had remained for above &s;eventy years. To prevent giving
umbrage, he drew no plan of the place, and even burnt
the few &s;ketches he had by him: however, as to utility,
the Colonel declared him&s;elf as much &s;atisfied as if he had
taken a plan. He could not a&s;certain the direct height of
the rampart, but thought it could not exceed twenty-five
feet, including the parapet. The river might be about
one hundred and thirty feet broad, and the entrance de|fended
by two or three &s;mall redoubts. As to forces, none
are ever garri&s;oned at Rochefort, except marines, which,
at the time the Colonel was on the &s;pot, amounted to about
one thou&s;and. This was the fir&s;t intelligence the mini|&s;try
received of the &s;tate of Rochefort, which afforded
&s;ufficient room to believe that an attack by &s;urpri&s;e might
be attended with happy con&s;equences. It was true, that
Colonel Clark made his ob&s;ervations in time of peace,
but it was likewi&s;e probable, that no great alterations were
made on account of the war, as $he place had remained in
the &s;ame condition during the two or three la&s;t wars with
France, when they had the &s;ame rea&s;ons as now to expect
their coa&s;ts would be in&s;ulted. The next information was
obtained from Jo&s;eph Thierry, a French pilot, of the pro|te&s;tant
religion, who pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal examinations before the
privy-council. This per&s;on declared that he had followed
the bu&s;ine&s;s of a pilot on the coa&s;t of France for the &s;pace
of twenty years, and &s;erved as fir&s;t pilot in &s;everal of the
King's &s;hips: that he had, in particular, piloted the Mag|nanime,
before &s;he was taken by the Engli&s;h, for about
twenty-two months, and had often conducted her into the
road of the I&s;le of Aix; and that he was perfectly ac|quainted
with the entrance, which, indeed, is &s;o ea&s;y as
to render a pilot almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary. The road, he &s;aid,
afforded good anchorage in twelve or fourteen fathom
water, as far as Bayonne: the channel between the i&s;lands
<PB N="88" REF="90">
of Oleron and Rh&eacute; was three leagues broad, and the banks
nece&s;&s;ary to be avoided lay near the land, except one called
the Boiard, which is ea&s;ily di&s;cerned by the breakers. He
affirmed that the large&s;t ve&s;&s;els might draw up clo&s;e to the
fort of Aix, which he would undertake the Magnanime
alone &s;hould de&s;troy; that the large&s;t &s;hips might come
up to the Vigerot, two miles di&s;tant from the mouth of the
river, with all their cannon and &s;tores: that men might
be landed to the north of fort Fouras, out of &s;ight of the
fort, upon a meadow where the ground is firm and level,
under cover of the cannon of the fleet. This landing place
he reckoned at about five miles from Rochefort, the way
dry, and no way intercepted by ditches and mora&s;&s;es. He
&s;aid great part of the city was encompa&s;&s;ed by a wall; but
towards the river, on both &s;ides, for about &s;ixty paces, it
was enclo&s;ed only with palli&s;adoes, without a fo&s;&s;e. To
the intelligence of Col. Clark and Thierry the mini&s;try
added a &s;ecret account obtained of the &s;trength and di&s;tri|bution
of the French forces, whence it appeared highly
probable that no more than ten thou&s;and men could be
allowed for the defence of the whole coa&s;t, from St. Valery
to Bourdeaux. In con&s;equence of the above information
the &s;ecret expedition was planned; in&s;tructions were given
to Sir John Mordaunt and Admiral Hawke to make a
vigorous impre&s;&s;ion on the French coa&s;t, and all the other
mea&s;ures projected, which it was imagined would make an
effectual diver&s;ion, by obliging the enemy to employ a great
part of their forces at home, di&s;turb and &s;hake the credit
of their public loans, impair the &s;trength and re&s;ources
of their navy, di&s;concert their exten&s;ive and dangerous
operations of war, and, finally, give life, &s;trength, and
lu&s;tre to the common cau&s;e and his Maje&s;ty's arms. The
board of enquiry took next into con&s;ideration the &s;everal
letters and explanatory in&s;tructions &s;ent to Sir John
Mordaunt, in con&s;equence of &s;ome difficulties which might
po&s;&s;ibly occur, &s;tated by that general in letters to the
mini&s;ter, previous to his &s;ailing. Then they examined

the report made to Sir Edward Hawke by Admiral Brode|rick,
and the captains of men of war &s;ent to &s;ound the
French &s;hore from Rochelle to fort Fouras, dated Septem|ber
the twenty-ninth; the re&s;ult of the councils of war on
the twenty-fifth and twenty-eighth; Sir Edward Hawke's
letter to Sir John Mordaunt on the twenty-&s;eventh, and
the general's an&s;wer on the twenty-ninth: after which
Sir John Mordaunt was called upon to give his rea&s;ons
for not putting his Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions and orders in
execution. This he did in &s;ub&s;tance as follows: The
attempt on Rochefort he under&s;tood was to have been on
the footing of a <HI>coup de main</HI> or &s;urpri&s;e, which it would be
impo&s;&s;ible to execute if the de&s;ign was di&s;covered or the
alarm taken. He al&s;o under&s;tood that an attempt could
not be made, nay, that his Maje&s;ty did not require it
&s;hould, unle&s;s a proper place for debarking, and a &s;afe re|treat
for the troops was di&s;covered; particularly where
the &s;hips could protect them, and a &s;afe communication
with the fleet, and conveyance of &s;upplies from it, were
found. His &s;entiments, he &s;aid, were confirmed by a
paper to this purpo&s;e, delivered to him by Sir John Li|gonier,
on his fir&s;t being appointed to command the ex|pedition.
It was likewi&s;e probable, he thought, that al|though
Rochefort &s;hould have remained in the &s;ituation in
which Colonel Clark and the pilot Thierry had &s;een it
three years before, yet that a few days preparation could
make it &s;ufficiently defen&s;ible again&s;t a <HI>coup de main.</HI>
Judging, therefore, the dependance on &s;uch an operation
alone improper, he applied to the mini&s;try for two more
old battalions, and artillery for a regular attack to force
the place, which, from its con&s;truction, appeared as diffi|cult
to be made defen&s;ible again&s;t the latter, as ea&s;ily &s;e|cured
again&s;t the former. But this reque&s;t being refu&s;ed,
he &s;till thought it his duty to obey his orders on the foot|ing
on which the expedition was planned, e&s;pecially as he
under&s;tood his in&s;tructions were di&s;cretionary, regarding
the circum&s;tances of the time, the condition of the place,
<PB N="90" REF="92">
and the nature of the &s;ervice. He recited the po&s;itive and
credible intelligence received, as well before the embarka|tion
as during the voyage, of the alarm given to France,
and the preparations made along the French coa&s;ts from
Bre&s;t and St. Maloes to Rochefort: the accidents that
kept the fleet hovering along the coa&s;ts, and prevented the
po&s;&s;ibility of an attempt by &s;urpri&s;e; the reports of all the
gentlemen employed in &s;ounding the coa&s;ts, &s;o contrary to
the intelligence given by Thierry the pilot: the opinion
of the council of war, by which he was enjoined to act,
and with which his own judgment concurred: the en|deavours
u&s;ed, after the twenty-&s;ixth, to find out &s;ome
expedient for annoying the enemy and executing his Ma|je&s;ty's
in&s;tructions: the attempt made to land, in con&s;e|quence
of the re&s;olution of the &s;econd council of war,
which was prevented by boi&s;terous and &s;tormy weather,
and, la&s;tly, the rea&s;ons that determined him, in concert
with the other land officers, to return to England.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. Having con&s;idered all the&s;e circum&s;tances, and
examined &s;everal officers who &s;erved in the expedition, the
court of enquiry gave in the following report to his Ma|je&s;ty:&mdash;
&startq;It appears to us, that one cau&s;e of the expe|dition
having failed is the not attacking fort Fouras by
&s;ea, at the &s;ame time that it could have been attacked by
land agreeably to the fir&s;t de&s;ign, which certainly mu&s;t
have been of the greate&s;t utility towards carrying your
Maje&s;ty's in&s;tructions into execution. It was at fir&s;t re|&s;olved
by Admiral Hawke (Thierry, the pilot, having un|dertaken
the &s;afe conduct of a &s;hip to &s;ort Fouras for that
purpo&s;e) but afterwards laid a&s;ide, upon the repre&s;enta|tion
of Vice Admiral Knowles, that the Bar&s;leur, the
&s;hip de&s;igned for that &s;ervice, was a-ground, at the di|&s;tance
of between four and five miles from the &s;hore: but
as neither Sir Edward Hawke or the pilot could attend to
give information upon that head, we cannot pre&s;ume
to offer any certain opinion thereupon. We conceive
another cau&s;e of the failure of the expedition to have
<PB N="91" REF="93">
been, that, in&s;tead of attempting to land when the report
was received, on the twenty-fourth of September, from
Read-Admiral Broderick, and the captains who had been
out to $ound and reconnoitre, a council of war was &s;um|moned,
and held on the twenty-fifth, in which it was
unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved not to land, as the attempt on
Rochefort was neither advi&s;eable or practicable: but it
does not appear to us that there were then, or at any time
afterwards, either a body of troops or batteries on &s;hore
&s;ufficient to have prevented the attempting a de&s;cent, in
pur&s;uance of the in&s;tructions &s;igned by your Maje&s;ty:
neither does it appear to us that there were any rea&s;ons
&s;ufficient to induce the council of war to believe that
Rochefort was &s;o changed in re&s;pect to its &s;trength, or
po&s;ture of defence, &s;ince the expedition was fir&s;t re&s;olved
on in England, as to prevent all attempts of an attack
upon the place, in order to burn and de&s;troy the docks,
magazines, ar&s;enals, and &s;hipping, in obedience to your
Maje&s;ty's command. And we think our&s;elves obliged to
remark, in the council of war on the twenty-eighth of
September, that no rea&s;on could have exi&s;ted &s;ufficient
to prevent the attempt of landing the troops, as the coun|cil
then unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to land with all po&s;&s;ible di|&s;patch.
We beg leave al&s;o to remark, that after its being
unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to land, in the council of war of the
twenty-eighth of September, the re&s;olution was taken of re|turning
to England, without any regular or general meeting
of the &s;aid council: but as the whole operation was of &s;o
incon&s;iderable a nature, we do not offer this to your Ma|je&s;ty
as a cau&s;e of the failure of the expedition, &s;ince we
cannot but look upon the expedition to have failed from
the time the great object of it was laid a&s;ide in the council of
war of the twenty-fifth.&endq;</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. This report, &s;igned by the general officers
Marlborough, Sackville, and Waldegrave, probably laid
the foundation for the court-martial which &s;at &s;oon after
upon the conduct of the commander in chief on the ex|pedition.
The enemies of the m&mdash;r made a handle of
<PB N="92" REF="94">
the mi&s;carriage to le&s;&s;en him in the e&s;teem of the public$
by laying the whole blame on his forming a project &s;$
expen&s;ive to the nation, on intelligence not only &s;light $word$
the fir&s;t view, but fal&s;e upon further examination. B$$
the people were &s;till his advocates, they di&s;cerned &s;ome
thing my&s;terious in the whole conduct of the commande
in chief. They plainly perceived that caution took plac$
of vigour, and that the hours for action were &s;pent in de
liberations and councils of war. Had he debarked th$
troops, and made &s;uch an attack as would have di&s;tingui&s;he$
his courage, the voice of the people would have acquitte$
him, however un&s;ucce&s;sful, though prudence, perhaps
might have condemned him. Even Braddock's ra&s;hne$$
they deemed preferable to M&mdash;'s inactivity: the lo&s;s $word$
&s;o many brave lives was thought le&s;s injurious and di&s;grace$ful
to the nation than the too &s;afe return of the pre&s;en$
armament. The one demon&s;trated that the Briti&s;h &s;piri$
&s;till exi&s;ted; the other &s;eemed to indicate the too powerfu$
influence of wealth, luxury, and tho&s;e manners which
tend to debauch and ema&s;culate the mind. A public$
trial of the commander in chief was expected by the peo|ple,
and it was graciou&s;ly granted by his Maje&s;ty. It $word$
even thought that Sir John Mordaunt him&s;elf demanded
to have his conduct &s;crutini&s;ed, by which method alone
he was &s;en&s;ible his character could be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. His
Maje&s;ty's warrant for holding a court-martial was accord|ingly
&s;igned on the third day of December. The cou$$
was compo&s;ed of nine lieutenant-generals, nine major-generals,
and three colonels, who &s;at on the fourteenth,
and continued by &s;everal adjournments to the twentieth.
Lieutenant-General Sir John Mordaunt came pri&s;oner
before the court, and the following charge was exhibited
again&s;t him; namely, That he being appointed by the
King commander in chief of his Maje&s;ty's forces &s;ent on
an expedition to the coa&s;t of France, and having received
orders and in&s;tructions relative thereto from his Maje&s;ty,
under his royal &s;ign-manual, and al&s;o by one of his prin|cipal
&s;ecretaries of &s;tate, had di&s;obeyed his Maje&s;ty's &s;aid
<PB N="93" REF="95">
orders and in&s;tructions. The proceedings of this court
were nearly &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the court of enquiry. The
&s;ame evidences were examined, with the addition of Sir
Edward Hawke's depo&s;ition; and a defence, differing in
no e&s;&s;ential point from the former, made by the pri&s;oner,
but the judgement given was clear and explicit. Sir John
Mordaunt was unanimou&s;ly found Not guilty, and there|fore
acquitted, while the publick opinion remained un|altered,
and many per&s;ons inveighed as bitterly again&s;t the
lenity of the pre&s;ent-court-martial as they had formerly
again&s;t the &s;everity of the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon a late un|fortunate
admiral. The evidence of one gentleman in
particular drew attention: he was accu&s;ed of tergiver&s;a|tion,
and of &s;howing that partial indulgence which his
own conduct required. He publickly defended his cha|racter:
his performance was cen&s;ured, and him&s;elf di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
the &s;ervice by his &s;overeign.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. Be&s;ides the diver&s;ion intended by a de&s;cent on
the coa&s;t of France, &s;everal other methods were employed
to amu&s;e the enemy, as well as to protect the trade of the
kingdom, &s;ecure our colonies in the We&s;t-Indies, and in|&s;ure
the continuance of the extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s which
had lately ble&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty's arms in the Ea&s;t-Indies;
but the&s;e we could not mention before without breaking
the thread of our narration. On the ninth of February
Admiral We&s;t &s;ailed with a &s;quadron of men of war to the
we&s;tward, as did Admiral Coates with the fleet under his
convoy to the We&s;t-Indies, and Commodore Stevens with
the trade to the Ea&s;t-Indies in the month of March. Ad|miral
Holbourn and Commodore Holmes, with eleven &s;hips
of the line, a fire-&s;hip, bomb-ketch, and fifty tran&s;ports,
$ailed from St. Helen's for America in April. The Ad|miral
had on board &s;ix thou&s;and two hundred effective men,
exclu&s;ive of officers, under the command of General
Hop&s;on, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Lord Charles Hay. In May Admiral
O&s;borne, who had been forced back to Plymouth with his
&s;quadron by &s;tre&s;s of weather, &s;et $ail for the Mediter|ranean,
<PB N="94" REF="96">
as did two &s;hips of war &s;ent to convoy the Am$|rican
trade.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. In the mean time, the privateers fitted out $word$
private merchants and &s;ocieties greatly annoyed the Fren$
commerce. The Antigallican, a private &s;hip of wa$
equipped by a &s;ociety of men who a&s;&s;umed that nam$
took the Duke de Penthievre Indiaman off the port of C$$runna,
and carried her into Cadiz. The prize was e&s;t$
mated worth two hundred thou&s;and pounds, and immedia$$
application was made by France to the court of Spain $word$
re&s;titution, while the proprietors of the Antigallican we
&s;quandering in mirth, fe&s;tivity, and riot the imagina$
wealth &s;o ea&s;ily and unexpectedly acquired. Such we
the remon&s;trances made to his Catholick Maje&s;ty with
r$&s;pect to the illegality of the prize, which the French Ea&s;$$India
Company a&s;&s;erted was taken within &s;hot of a neut$$port,
that the Penthievre was fir&s;t violently wre&s;ted out of $word$
hands of the captors, then detained as a depo&s;it, with &s;eal$
hatches, and a Spani&s;h guard on board, till the claims $word$
both parties could be examined, and at la&s;t adjudged to $word$
an illegal capture, and con&s;equently re&s;tored to the Frenc$
to the great di&s;appointment of the owners of the privatee$
Be&s;ides the &s;ucce&s;s which attended a great number of oth$$
privateers, the lords of the Admiralty publi&s;hed a li&s;t $word$
above thirty &s;hips of war and privateers taken from $word$
enemy, in the &s;pace of four months, by the Engli&s;h &s;loo$
and &s;hips of war, exclu&s;ive of the Duke d'Aquitaine $word$
diaman, now &s;itted out as a &s;hip of war, taken by the E$g$
and Medway; the Pondicherry Indiaman, valued at $word$
hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, taken by the Dov$
man of war; and above &s;ix privateers brought into port $word$
the diligent and brave Capt. Lockhart, for which he $word$
honoured with a variety of pre&s;ents of plate by &s;ever$
corporations, in te&s;timony of their e&s;teem and regar$
This run of good fortune was not, however, without &s;om$
retribution on the &s;ide of the enemy, who, out of twenty
one &s;hips homeward-bound from Carolina, made prize $word$
<PB N="95" REF="97">
nineteen, whence the merchants &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable
damage, and a great quantity of valuable commodities, in|digo
in particular, was lo&s;t to this country.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. Notwith&s;tanding the large imports of grain
from different parts of Europe and America, the artifice of
engro&s;&s;ers &s;till kept up the price of corn. So incen&s;ed
were the populace at the iniquitous combinations entered
into to fru&s;trate the endeavours of the legi&s;lature, and to
oppre&s;s the poor, that they ro&s;e in a tumultuous manner in
&s;everal counties, &s;ometimes to the number of five or &s;ix
thou&s;and, and &s;eized upon the grain brought to market.
Nor was it indeed to be wondered at, con&s;idering the di|&s;tre&s;s
to which many per&s;ons were reduced. The difficulty
of obtaining the nece&s;&s;aries of life rai&s;ed the price of labour
at the mo&s;t un&s;ea&s;onable time, when all manufacturers
were over&s;tocked for want of a proper market, which obliged
them to di&s;mi&s;s above half the hands before employed.
Hence aro&s;e the mo&s;t pitiable condition of &s;everal thou&s;ands
of u&s;eful indu&s;trious &s;ubjects; a calamity attended only
with one advantage to the publick, namely, the facility
with which recruits were rai&s;ed for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice.
At la&s;t the plentiful crops with which it plea&s;ed Provi|dence
to ble&s;s the&s;e kingdoms, the prodigious quantities
of corn imported from foreign countries, and the wi&s;e mea|&s;ures
of the legi&s;lature, broke all the villainous &s;chemes &s;et
on foot by the fore&s;tallers and engro&s;&s;ers, and reduced the
price of corn to the u&s;ual &s;tandard. The publick joy on
this event was greatly augmented by the &s;afe arrival of the
fleet from the Leeward I&s;lands, con&s;i&s;ting of ninety-two
$ail, and of the Straits fleet, e&s;teemed worth three mil|lions
&s;terling, whereby the &s;ilk manufacturers in particular
were again employed, and their di&s;tre&s;&s;es relieved. About
the &s;ame time the India company was highly elated with
the joyful account of the &s;afe arrival and &s;pirited conduct
of three of their captains, attacked in their pa&s;&s;age home|ward
by two French men of war, one of &s;ixty-four, the
other of twenty-&s;ix guns. After a warm engagement,
<PB N="96" REF="98">
which continued for three hours, they obliged the French
&s;hips to &s;heer off, with &s;carce any lo&s;s on their own &s;ide.
When the engagement began, the captains had promi&s;ed
a reward of a thou&s;and pounds to the crews, by way of
incitement to their valour; and the company doubled the
&s;um, in recompen&s;e of their fidelity and courage. His
Maje&s;ty, having taken into con&s;ideration the incredible
damage &s;u&s;tained by the commerce of the&s;e kingdoms, for
want of proper harbours and forts on the we&s;tern coa&s;t to
receive and protect merchantmen, was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed
to order that a temporary &s;ecurity &s;hould be provided for
the &s;hipping which might touch at Milford-haven, until
the fortifications voted in parliament could be erected.
How far his Maje&s;ty's directions were complied with, the
number of merchant &s;hips taken by the enemies privateer$
upon that coa&s;t &s;ufficiently indicated.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. Whatever rea&s;ons the government had to ex|pect
the campaign &s;hould be vigorou&s;ly pu&s;hed in America,
almo&s;t every circum&s;tance turned out contrary to expect|ation.
Not all the endeavours of the Earl of Loudoun to
quiet the diffentions among the different provinces, and to
e&s;tabli&s;h unanimity and harmony, could prevail. Circum|&s;tances
required that he &s;hould act the part of a mediator,
in order to rai&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies for pro&s;ecuting the
war, without which it was impo&s;&s;ible he could appear in
the character of a general. The enemy, in the mean time,
were pur&s;uing the blow given at O&s;wego, and taking ad|vantage
of the di&s;traction that appeared in the Briti&s;h
councils. By their &s;ucce&s;&s;es in the preceding campaign,
they remained ma&s;ters of all the lakes. Hence they were
furni&s;hed with the means of practi&s;ing on the Indians in
all the different di&s;tricts, and obliging them, by rewards,
promi&s;es, and menaces, to act in their favour. Every
acce&s;&s;ion to their &s;trength was a real diminution of that
of the Briti&s;h commander; but then the ignorance or
pu&s;illanimity of &s;ome of the in&s;erior officers in our back
&s;ettlements was, in effect, more beneficial to the enemy
<PB N="97" REF="99">
than all the vigilance and activity of Montcalm. In con|&s;equence
of the &s;hameful lo&s;s of O&s;wego, they voluntarily
abandoned to the mercy of the French general the whole
country of the Five Nations, the only body of Indians who
had inviolably performed their engagements, or indeed
who had pre&s;erved any &s;incere regard for the Briti&s;h go|vernment.
The communication with the&s;e faithful allies
was now cut off, by the imprudent demolition of the forts
we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at the great Carrying-place. A &s;trong fort, in|deed,
was built at Winche&s;ter, and called Fort Loudoun,
after the commander in chief, and four hundred Cherokee
Indians joined the Engli&s;h forces at Fort Cumberland:
but this re-enforcement by no means counterbalanced the
lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained in con&s;equence of our having imprudently
&s;topped up Wood creek, and filled it with logs. Every
per&s;on the lea&s;t acquainted with the country readily per|ceived
the weakne&s;s of the&s;e mea&s;ures, by which our whole
frontier was left open and expo&s;ed to the irruption of the
&s;avages in the French intere&s;t, who would not fail to profit
by our blunders, too notorious to e&s;cape them. By the
removal of the&s;e barriers, a path was opened to our fine
&s;ettlements on tho&s;e grounds called the German Flats,
and along the Mohawk's river, which the enemy de&s;troy|ed
with fire and &s;word before the end of the campaign.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. In the mean time Lord Loudoun was taking
the mo&s;t effectual &s;teps to unite the provinces, and rai&s;e a
force &s;ufficient to give &s;ome deci&s;ive blow. The attack on
Crown-Point, which had been &s;o long meditated, was laid
a&s;ide, as of le&s;s importance than the intended expedition
to Loui&s;bourg, now &s;ub&s;tituted in its place, and undoubt|edly
a more con&s;iderable object in it&s;elf. Admiral Hol|bourn
arrived at Hallifax, with the &s;quadron and tran&s;|ports
under his command, on the ninth of July; and it
was his lord&s;hip's intention to repair thither with all po&s;&s;ible
diligence, in order to take upon him the command of the
expedition; but a variety of accidents interpo&s;ed. It was
with the utmo&s;t difficulty he at length a&s;&s;embled a body of
&s;ix thou&s;and men, with which he in&s;tantly began his
<PB N="98" REF="100">
march to join the troops lately arrived from England.
When the junction was effected, the whole forces amount|ed
to twelve thou&s;and men; an army that rai&s;ed great ex|pectations.
Immediately &s;ome &s;mall ve&s;&s;els were &s;ent out
to examine and reconnoitre the condition of the enemy,
and the intermediate time was employed in embarking the
troops, as &s;oon as the tran&s;ports arrived. The return of
the &s;couts totally altered the face of affairs: they brought
the unwelcome news, that M. de Bois de la Mothe, who
&s;ailed in the month of May from Bre&s;t with a large fleet of
&s;hips of war and tran&s;ports, was now &s;afe at anchor in the
harbour of Loui&s;bourg. Their intelligence was &s;upported
by the te&s;timony of &s;everal de&s;erters; yet &s;till it wanted
confirmation, and many per&s;ons believed their account of
the enemy's &s;trength greatly magnified. Such advices,
however, could not but occa&s;ion extraordinary fluctuations
in the councils of war at Hallifax. Some were for &s;etting
a&s;ide all thoughts of the expedition for that &s;ea&s;on; while
others, more warm in their di&s;po&s;itions, and &s;anguine in
their expectations, were for pro&s;ecuting it with vigour, in
&s;pite of all dangers and difficulties. Their di&s;putes were
carried on with great vehemence, when a packet bound
from Loui&s;bourg for France was taken by one of the Eng|li&s;h
&s;hips &s;tationed at Newfoundland. She had letters
on board, which put the enemy's &s;uperiority beyond all
doubt, at lea&s;t by &s;ea. It clearly appeared there were at
that time in Loui&s;bourg &s;ix thou&s;and regular troops, three
thou&s;and natives, and one thou&s;and three hundred In|dians,
with &s;eventeen &s;hips of the line, and three frigates
moored in the harbour; that the place was well &s;upplied
with ammunition, provi&s;ion, and every kind of military
&s;tores; and that the enemy wi&s;hed for nothing more than
an attack, which it was probable would terminate to the
di&s;grace of the a&s;&s;ailants, and ruin of the Briti&s;h affairs in
America. The commanders at Hallifax were fully appri&s;ed
of the con&s;equences of an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt; it was,
therefore, almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to po&s;tpone the
expedition to &s;ome more convenient opportunity, e&s;pecially
<PB N="99" REF="101">
as the &s;ea&s;on was now far advanced, which alone would
be &s;ufficient to fru&s;trate their endeavours, and render the
enterpri&s;e abortive. This re&s;olution &s;eems, indeed, to
have been the mo&s;t eligible in their circum&s;tances,
whatever con&s;tructions might afterwards be given, with
intention to prejudice the publick again&s;t the commander
in chief.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. Lord Loudoun's departure from New-York,
with all the forces he was able to collect, afforded the
Marquis de Montcalm the faire&s;t occa&s;ion of improving
the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the former campaign. That general had,
in the very commencement of the &s;ea&s;on, made three dif|ferent
attacks on Fort William-Henry, in all of which
he was repul&s;ed by the vigour and re&s;olution of the gar|ri&s;on.
But his di&s;appointment here was balanced by an
advantage gained by a party of regulars and Indians at
Ticonderoga. Colonel John Parker, with a detachment
of near four hundred men, went by water, in whale and
bay boats, to attack the enemy's advanced guard at that
place. Landing at night on an i&s;land, he &s;ent before
dawn three boats to the main land, which the enemy way-laid
and took. Having procured the nece&s;&s;ary intelligence
from the pri&s;oners of the colonel's de&s;igns, they contrived
their mea&s;ures, placed three hundred men in ambu&s;h be|hind
the point where he propo&s;ed landing, and &s;ent three
batteaux to the place of rendezvous. Colonel Parker
mi&s;taking the&s;e for his own boats, eagerly put to &s;hore,
was &s;urrounded by the enemy, re-enforced with four hun|dred
men, and attacked with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that, of
the whole detachment, only two officers and &s;eventy pri|vate
men e&s;caped. Flu&s;hed with this advantage, animated
by the ab&s;ence of the Briti&s;h commander in chief, then at
Hallifax, and fired with a de&s;ire to revenge the di&s;grace he
had lately &s;u&s;tained before Fort Henry, Montcalm drew
together all his forces, with intention to lay &s;iege to that
place. Fort William-Henry &s;tands on the &s;outhern coa&s;t
of Lake George: it was built with a view to protect and
cover the frontiers of the Engli&s;h colonies, as well as to
<PB N="100" REF="102">
command the lake: the fortifications were good, defended
by a garri&s;on of near three thou&s;and men, and covered by
an army of four thou&s;and, under the conduct of General
Webb, po&s;ted at no great di&s;tance. When the Marquis
de Montcalm had a&s;&s;embled all the forces at Crown-Point,
Ticonderoga, and the adjacent po&s;ts, together with
a con&s;iderable body of Canadians and Indians, amounting
in the whole to near ten thou&s;and men, he marched directly
to the fort, made his approaches, and began to batter it
with a numerous train of artillery. On the very day he
inve&s;ted the place, he &s;ent a letter to Colonel Monro, the
governor, telling him, he thought him&s;elf obliged, in hu|manity,
to de&s;ire he would &s;urrender the fort, and not pro|voke
the great number of &s;avages in the French army by
a vain re&s;i&s;tance. &ldquo;A detachment of your garri&s;on has
lately, &s;ays he, experienced their cruelty; I have it yet
in my power to re&s;train them, and oblige them to ob&s;erve
a capitulation, as none of them hitherto are killed.
Your per&s;i&s;ting in the defence of your fort can only retard
its fate a few days, and mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity expo&s;e an un|fortunate
garri&s;on, who can po&s;&s;ibly receive no relief,
con&s;idering the precautions taken to prevent it. I demand
a deci&s;ive an&s;wer, for which purpo&s;e I have &s;ent the Sieur
Funtbrune, one of my aides-du-camp. You may credit
what he will inform you of, from Montcalm.&rdquo; Gen.
Webb beheld his preparations with an indifference and
&s;ecurity bordering on infatuation. It is credibly reported,
that he had private intelligence of all the French general's
de&s;igns and motions; yet, either de&s;pi&s;ing his &s;trength, or
di&s;crediting the information, he neglected collecting the
militia in time, which, in conjunction with his own forces,
would probably have obliged Montcalm to relinqui&s;h the
attempt, or, at lea&s;t, have rendered his &s;ucce&s;s very doubtful
and hazardous. The enemy meeting with no di&s;turbance
from the quarter they mo&s;t dreaded, pro&s;ecuted the &s;iege
with vigour, and were warmly received by the garri&s;on,
who fired with great &s;pirit till they had bur&s;t almo&s;t all
their cannon, and expended their ammunition. Neither
<PB N="101" REF="103">
Montcalm's promi&s;es or threats could prevail upon them to
&s;urrender, while they were in a condition to defend them|&s;elves,
or could rea&s;onably expect a&s;&s;i&s;tance from General
Webb. They even per&s;i&s;ted to hold out after prudence
dictated they ought to &s;urrender. Colonel Monro was
&s;en&s;ible of the importance of his charge, and imagined
that General Webb, though &s;low in his motions, would
&s;urely make &s;ome vigorous efforts either to rai&s;e the &s;iege,
or force a &s;upply of ammunition, provi&s;ion, and other ne|ce&s;&s;aries
into the garri&s;on. At length nece&s;&s;ity obliged
him, after &s;u&s;taining a &s;iege from the third to the ninth
day of Augu&s;t, to hang out a flag of truce, which was
immediately an&s;wered by the French commander. Ho&s;|tages
were exchanged, and articles of capitulation &s;igned
by both parties. It was &s;tipulated, that the garri&s;on of
Fort William-Henry, and the troops in the retrenched
camp, &s;hould march out with their arms, the baggage of
the officers and &s;oldiers, and all the u&s;ual nece&s;&s;aries of
war; e&s;corted by a detachment of French troops, and in|terpreters
attached to the &s;avages: that the gate of the fort
&s;hould be delivered to the troops of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
King, immediately after &s;igning the capitulation; and
the retrenched camp, on the departure of the Briti&s;h forces:
that the artillery, warlike &s;tores, provi&s;ion, and in general
every thing, except the effects of the &s;oldiers and officers,
&s;hould, upon honour, be delivered to the French troops;
for which purpo&s;e it was agreed there &s;hould be delivered,
with the capitulation, an exact inventory of the &s;tores,
and other particulars &s;pecified: that the garri&s;on of the
fort, and the troops in the retrenchment and dependencies,
&s;hould not &s;erve for the &s;pace of eighteen months, from the
date of the capitulation, again&s;t his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Ma|je&s;ty,
or his allies: that with the capitulation there &s;hould
be delivered an exact &s;tate of the troops, &s;pecifying the
names of the officers, engineers, artillery men, commi&s;&s;a|ries,
and all employed: that the officers and &s;oldiers,
Canadians, women, and &s;avages, made pri&s;oners by land
&s;ince the commencement of the war in North-America,
<PB N="102" REF="104">
&s;hould be delivered in the &s;pace of three months at Carri|lon;
in return for whom an equal number of the garri&s;on
of Fort William-Henry &s;hould be capacitated to &s;erve,
agreeably to the return given by the Engli&s;h officer, and
the receipt of the French commanding officers, of the
pri&s;oners &s;o delivered: that an officer &s;hould remain as an
ho&s;tage, till the &s;afe return of the e&s;cort &s;ent with the
troops of his Britannick Maje&s;ty: that the &s;ick and wound|ed,
not in a condition to be tran&s;ported to Fort Edward,
&s;hould remain under the protection of the Marquis de
Montcalm; who engaged to u&s;e them with tenderne&s;s and
humanity, and to return them as &s;oon as recovered: that
provi&s;ion for two days &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued out for the Briti&s;h
troops: that in te&s;timony of his e&s;teem and re&s;pect for
Colonel Monro and his garri&s;on, on account of their gal|lant
defence, the Marquis de Montcalm &s;hould return one
cannon, a &s;ix pounder.&mdash;Whether the Marquis de Mont|calm
was really a&s;&s;iduous to have the&s;e articles punctually
executed we cannot pretend to determine; but certain
it is, they were perfidiou&s;ly broke, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance.
The &s;avages in the French intere&s;t either paid no regard
to the capitulation, or were permitted, from views of
policy, to act the mo&s;t treacherous, inhuman, and in$idi|ous
part. They fell upon the Briti&s;h troops as they march|ed
out, de&s;poiled them of their few remaining effects,
dragged the Indians in the Engli&s;h &s;ervice out of their
ranks&punc; and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated them with circum&s;tances of un|heard-of
barbarity. Some Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, with their
wives and children, are &s;aid to have been &s;avagely murther|ed
by tho&s;e brutal Indians, who&s;e ferocity the French
commander could not effectually re&s;train. The greater
part of the Engli&s;h garri&s;on, however, arrived at Fort
Edward, under protection of the French e&s;cort. The
enemy demoli&s;hed the fort, carried off the effects, provi|&s;ion,
artillery, and every thing el&s;e le&s;t by the garri&s;on,
together with the ve&s;&s;els pre&s;erved in the lake, and de|parted,
without pur&s;uing their &s;ucce&s;s by any other at|tempt.
Thus ended the third campaign in America, where,
<PB N="103" REF="105">
with an evident &s;uperiority over the enemy, an army of
twenty thou&s;and regular troops, a great number of pro|vincial
forces, and a prodigious naval power, not le&s;s
than twenty &s;hips of the line, we abandoned our allies,
expo&s;ed our people, &s;uffered them to be cruelly ma&s;&s;acred
in &s;ight of our troops, and relinqui&s;hed a large and va|luable
tract of country, to the eternal reproach and di&s;|grace
of the Briti&s;h name.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. As to the naval tran&s;actions in this country,
though le&s;s infamous, they were not le&s;s unfortunate.
Immediately on Lord Loudoun's departure from Hallifax,
Admiral Holbourn, now freed from the care of the tran&s;|ports,
&s;et &s;ail for Loui&s;bourg, with fifteen &s;hips of the line,
one &s;hip of fifty guns, three &s;mall frigates, and a fire-&s;hip.
What the object of this crui&s;e might have been can only
be conjectured. Some imagine curio&s;ity was the Admi|ral's
&s;ole motive, and the de&s;ire of informing him&s;elf with
certainty of the enemy's &s;trength, while others per&s;uade
them&s;elves that he was in hopes of drawing M. de la Mothe
to an engagement, notwith&s;tanding his &s;uperiority in num|ber
of &s;hips and weight of metal. Be this as it may, the
Briti&s;h &s;quadron appeared off Loui&s;bourg on the twen|tieth
day of Augu&s;t, and approaching within two miles
of the batteries, &s;aw the French admiral make the &s;ignal
to unmoor. Mr. Holbourn was greatly inferior in &s;trength,
and it is obvious that his de&s;ign was not to fight the ene|my,
as he immediately made the be&s;t of his way to Halli|fax.
About the middle of September, being re-enforced
with four &s;hips of the line, he again proceeded to Loui&s;|bourg,
probably with intention, if po&s;&s;ible, to draw the
enemy to an engagement; but he found De la Mothe too
prudent to hazard an unnece&s;&s;ary battle, the lo&s;s of which
would have greatly expo&s;ed all the French colonies. Here
the Engli&s;h &s;quadron continued crui&s;ing until the twenty-fifth,
when they were overtaken by a terrible &s;torm from
the &s;outhward. When the hurricane began, the fleet was
about forty leagues di&s;tant from Loui&s;bourg: but were
driven in twelve hours within two mi&s;es of the rocks and
<PB N="104" REF="106">
breakers on that coa&s;t, when the wind providentially
&s;hifted. The &s;hip Tilbury was wrecked upon the rocks,
and half her crew drowned. Eleven &s;hips were di&s;|ma&s;ted,
others threw their guns overboard; and all re|turned
in a very &s;hattered condition to England, at a very
unfavourable &s;ea&s;on of the year. In this manner ended
the expedition to Loui&s;bourg, more unfortunate to the
nation than the preceding de&s;igns upon Rochefort; le&s;s
di&s;graceful to the commanders, but equally the occa&s;ion
of ridicule and triumph to our enemies. Indeed, the un|happy
con&s;equences of the political di&s;putes at home,
the in&s;tability of the admini&s;tration, and the frequent re|volutions
in our councils were &s;trongly manife&s;ted by that
langour infu&s;ed into all our military operations, and general
un&s;teadine&s;s in our pur&s;uits. Faction in the mother
country produced divi&s;ions and mi&s;conduct in the colo|nies.
No ambition to &s;ignali&s;e them&s;elves appeared among
the officers, from the uncertainty whether their &s;ervices
were to be rewarded or condemned. Their attachment to
particular per&s;ons weakened the love they ought to have
entertained for their country in general, and de&s;troyed
that &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e, that firmne&s;s and re&s;olution which
con&s;titutes the commander, and without which the be&s;t
capacity, joined to the mo&s;t uncorruptible integrity, can
effect nothing.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The French King not only exerted him&s;elf
again&s;t the Engli&s;h in America, but even extended his
operations to their &s;ettlements in Africa, which he &s;ent one
of his naval commanders, with a &s;mall &s;quadron, to reduce.
This gentleman, who&s;e name was Ker&s;in, had &s;coured the
coa&s;t of Guinea, and made prize of &s;everal Engli&s;h trading
&s;hips: but his chief aim was to reduce the ca&s;tle at Cape-coa&s;t,
of which had he gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the other &s;ubor|dinate
forts would have &s;ubmitted without oppo&s;ition.
When Mr. Bell, the governor of this ca&s;tle, received intel|ligence
that M. de Ker&s;in was a few leagues to windward,
and certainly intended to attack Cape-coa&s;t, his whole
garri&s;on did not exceed thirty white men, exclu&s;ive of a few
<PB N="105" REF="107">
Mulatto &s;oldiers: his &s;tock of ammunition was reduced to
half a barrel of gunpowder; and his fortifications were &s;o
cra&s;y and incon&s;iderable, that, in the opinion of the be&s;t
engineers, they could not have &s;u&s;tained for twenty minutes
the fire of one great &s;hip, had it been properly directed and
maintained. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, few people would
have dreamed of making any preparation for defence; but
Mr. Bell entertained other &s;entiments, and acquitted him|&s;elf
with equal courage and di&s;cretion. He forthwith pro|cured
a &s;upply of gunpowder, and a re-enforcement of
about fifty men, from certain trading ve&s;&s;els that happened
to be upon that part of the coa&s;t. He mounted &s;ome
&s;pare cannon upon an occa&s;ional battery, and a&s;&s;embling a
body of twelve hundred negroes, well armed, under the
command of their chief, on who&s;e attachment he could
depend, ordered them to take po&s;t at the place where he
apprehended the enemy would attempt a landing. The&s;e
precautions were hardly taken when the French &s;quadron,
con&s;i&s;ting of two &s;hips of the line and a large frigate, ap|peared,
and in a little time their attack began, but they
met with &s;uch a warm reception, that in le&s;s than two
hours they de&s;i&s;ted, leaving the ca&s;tle very little damaged,
and immediately made &s;ail for the We&s;t-Indies, very much
to the di&s;appointment and mortification of the Dutch offi|cers
belonging to the fort of Elmina, in the &s;ame neigh|bourhood,
who made no &s;cruple of expre&s;&s;ing their wi&s;hes
publickly in favour of the French commodore, and at a
di&s;tance viewed the engagement with the mo&s;t partial
eagerne&s;s and impatience. M. de Ker&s;in was generally
blamed for his want of conduct and re&s;olution in this at|tempt:
but he is &s;aid to have been deceived in his opinion
of the real &s;tate of Cape-coa&s;t ca&s;tle by the vigorous and
re&s;olute exertions of the governor, and was apprehen&s;ive of
lo&s;ing a ma&s;t in the engagement; a lo&s;s which he could
not have repaired on the whole coa&s;t of Africa. Had the
fort of Cape-coa&s;t been reduced on this occa&s;ion, in all pro|bability
every petty republick of the Negroes &s;ettled under
<PB N="106" REF="108">
the protection of the forts on the Gold Coa&s;t would have
revolted from the Briti&s;h intere&s;t: for while the French
&s;quadron, in their progre&s;s along &s;hore, hovered in the
o$$ing at Anamaboe, an Engli&s;h &s;ettlement a few leagues
to leeward of Cape-coa&s;t, John Corrantee, the caboceiro,
chief magi&s;trate and general of the Blacks on that part of
the coa&s;t, who&s;e adopted &s;on had a few years before been
care&s;&s;ed, and even treated as a prince in England, taking
it for granted that this enterpri&s;e of the French would be
attended with &s;ucce&s;s, actually &s;ent &s;ome of his depend|ants,
with a pre&s;ent of refre&s;hments for their commodore;
the delivery of which, however, was prevented by Mr.
Brew, the Engli&s;h chief of the fort, who &s;hattered in
pieces the canoe before it could be launched, and threat|ened
with his cannon to level the black town with the
du&s;t. The caboceiro, though thus anticipated in his de|&s;ign,
re&s;olved to be among the fir&s;t who &s;hould compliment
M. de Ker&s;in on his victory at Cape-coa&s;t; and, with
this view, prepared an emba&s;&s;y or deputation to go there
by land; but, under&s;tanding that the French had failed
in their attempt, he &s;hifted his de&s;ign, without the lea&s;t
he&s;itation, and di&s;patched the &s;ame emba&s;&s;y to Mr. Bell,
whom he congratulated on his victory, a&s;&s;uring him he had
kept his men ready armed to march at the fir&s;t &s;ummon$to
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. In the Ea&s;t-Indies the &s;cene was changed
greatly to the honour and advantage of Great-Britain.
There the commanders acted with that harmony, $word$
and unanimity becoming Britons, zealous for the $word$
their king and the intere&s;t of their country. We left Admi|ral
Wat&s;on and Colonel Clive advancing to Calcutta, $word$
revenge the cruel tragedy acted upon their countrymen the
preceding year. On the twenty-eighth of December, the
fleet proceeded up the river: next day Colonel $word$
landed, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;quadron, in twenty$
four hours made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Bu&s;budgia, a place $word$
great &s;trength, though very ill defended. On the fir&s;t $word$
January the Admiral, with two &s;hips, appeared before the
<PB N="107" REF="109">
town of Calcutta, and was received by a bri&s;k fire from
the batteries. This &s;alute was returned &s;o warmly, that
the enemies guns were &s;oon &s;ilenced, and in le&s;s than two
hours the place and fort were abandoned. Colonel Clive,
on the other &s;ide, had inve&s;ted the town, and made his
attack with that vigour and intrepidity peculiar to him&s;elf,
which greatly contributed to the &s;udden reduction of the
&s;ettlement. As &s;oon as the fort was &s;urrendered, the brave
and active Captain Coote, with his Maje&s;ty's troops, took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and found ninety-one pieces of cannon, four
mortars, abundance of ammunition, &s;tores, and provi&s;ion,
with every requi&s;ite for &s;u&s;taining an ob&s;tinate &s;iege.
Thus the Engli&s;h were re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the two &s;tronge&s;t
fortre&s;&s;es in the Ganges, with the incon&s;iderable lo&s;s of
nine &s;eamen killed, and three &s;oldiers. A few days after,
Hughley, a city of great trade, &s;ituated higher up the river,
was reduced with as little difficulty, but infinitely greater
prejudice to the nabob, as here his &s;torehou&s;es of &s;alt, and
va&s;t granaries for the &s;upport of his army, were burnt and
de&s;troyed. Incen&s;ed at the almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous lo&s;s of all
his conque&s;ts, and demolition of the city of Hughley, the
viceroy of Bengal di&s;couraged all advances to an accommo|dation
which was propo&s;ed by the admiral and chiefs of the
company, and a&s;&s;embled an army of twenty thou&s;and hor&s;e
and fifteen thou&s;and $oot, fully re&s;olved to expel the
Engli&s;h out of his dominions, and take ample vengeance
for the di&s;graces he had lately &s;u&s;tained. He was &s;een
marching by the Engli&s;h camp in his way to Calcutta on
the &s;econd of February, where he encamped, about a mile
from the town. Colonel Clive immediately made appli|cation
to the admiral for a re-enforcement, and &s;ix hun|dred
men, under the command of Captain Warwick, were
accordingly dra$ted from the different &s;hips, and &s;ent to
a&s;&s;i&s;t his little army. Clive drew out his forces, advanced
in three columns towards the enemy, and began the attack
&s;o vigorou&s;ly, that the viceroy retreated, after a feeble re|&s;i&s;tance,
with the lo&s;s of a thou&s;and men killed, wounded,
and taken pri&s;oners, five hundred hor&s;es, great numbers of
<PB N="108" REF="110">
draft bullocks, and four elephants. Though this advan|tage
was le&s;s deci&s;ive than could be wi&s;hed, yet it &s;uffici|ently
intimidated the Nabob into conce&s;&s;ions much to the
honour and advantage of the company. Admiral Wat&s;on
gave him to under&s;tand in a letter, that this was no more
than a &s;pecimen of what the Briti&s;h arms, when provoked,
could perform. The Suba de&s;ired the negociation might
be renewed, and in a few days the treaty was concluded.
He promi&s;ed not to di&s;turb the Engli&s;h in any of tho&s;e
privileges or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;pecified in the firm and granted
by the Mogul: that all merchandi&s;e belonging to the
company &s;hould pa&s;s and repa&s;s in every part of the pro|vince
of Bengal, free of duty: that all the Engli&s;h facto|ries
&s;ei&s;ed the preceding year, or &s;ince, &s;hould be re&s;tored,
with the money, goods, and effects appertaining: that all
damages &s;u&s;tained by the Engli&s;h &s;hould be repaired, and
their lo&s;&s;es repaid: that the Engli&s;h &s;hould have liberty to
fortify Calcutta in whatever manner they thought proper
without interruption: that they &s;hould have the liberty of
coining all the gold and bullion they imported, which
&s;hould pa&s;s current in the province: that he would re|main
in &s;trict friend&s;hip and alliance with the Engli&s;h,
u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to heal up the late divi&s;ions,
and re&s;tore the former good under&s;tanding between them.
All which &s;everal articles were &s;olemnly &s;igned and &s;ealed
with the Nabob's own hand.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. Such were the terms obtained for the com|pany
by the &s;pirited and gallant conduct of the two Eng|li&s;h
commanders. They had, however, too much di&s;cern|ment
to rely on the promi&s;es of a barbarian, who had &s;o
perfidiou&s;ly broke former engagements; but they prudently
di&s;&s;embled their &s;entiments, until they had thoroughly
rein&s;tated the affairs of the company, and reduced the
French power in this province. In order to adju&s;t the
points that required di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the &s;elect committee for the
company's affairs appointed Mr. Watts, who had been
relea&s;ed from his former impri&s;onment, as their commi&s;&s;ary
at the court of the Suba, to whom he was per&s;onally
<PB N="109" REF="111">
known, as well as to his mini&s;ters, among whom he had
required a con&s;iderable influence. Nothing le&s;s could
have balanced the intere&s;t which the French, by their art
of intriguing, had rai&s;ed among the favourites of the vice|roy.
While Mr. Watts was employed at Muxadavad,
in counterworking tho&s;e intrigues, and keeping the Suba
&s;teady to his engagements, the Admiral and Mr. Clive
re&s;olved to avail them&s;elves of their armament in attacking
the French &s;ettlements in Bengal. The chief object of
their de&s;igns was the reduction of Chandernagore, &s;ituated
higher up the river than Calcutta, of con&s;iderable &s;trength,
and the chief in importance of any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that nation
in the bay. Colonel Clive being re-enforced by three hun|dred
men from Bombay, began his march to Chanderna|gore,
at the head of &s;even hundred Europeans and one
thou&s;and &s;ix hundred Indians, where, on his fir&s;t arrival,
he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the out-po&s;ts, except one redoubt
mounted with eight pieces of cannon, which he left to be
&s;ilenced by the admiral. On the eighteenth of March the
Admirals Wat&s;on and Pococke arrived within two miles
of the French &s;ettlement, with the Kent, Tiger, and Sa|li&s;bury
men of war, and found their pa&s;&s;age ob&s;tructed by
booms laid acro&s;s the river, and &s;everal ve&s;&s;els &s;unk in
the channel. The&s;e difficulties being removed, they ad|vanced
early on the twenty-fourth, and drew up in a line
before the fort, which they battered with great fury for
three hours; while Colonel Clive was making his ap|proaches
on the land &s;ide, and playing vigorou&s;ly from the
batteries he had rai&s;ed. Their united efforts &s;oon obliged
the enemy to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. A flag of truce was waved over
the walls, and the place &s;urrendered by capitulation. The
keys were delivered to Captain Latham, of the Tiger, and
in the afternoon Colonel Clive, with the King's troops,
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Thus the reduction of a &s;trong fortre&s;s
garri&s;oned by five hundred Europeans, and one thou&s;and
two hundred Indians, defended by one hundred and
twenty-three pieces of cannon, and three mortars, well
provided with all kinds of &s;tores and nece&s;&s;aries, and of
<PB N="110" REF="112">
very great importance to the enemy's commerce in India,
was accompli&s;hed with a lo&s;s not exceeding forty men on
the &s;ide of the conquerors. By the treaty of capitulation
the director, coun&s;ellors, and in$erior &s;evants of the &s;ettle|ment
were allowed to depart with their wearing apparel:
the Je&s;uits were permitted to take away their church orna|ments,
and the natives to remain in the full exertion of their
liberties; but the garri&s;on were to continue pri&s;oners of war.
The goods and money found in the place were con&s;idera|ble;
but the principal advantage aro&s;e from the ruin of the
head &s;ettlement of the enemy on the Ganges, which could
not but interfere with the Engli&s;h commerce in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. Succe&s;s had hitherto attended all the opera|tions
of the Briti&s;h commanders, becau&s;e they were con|certed
with fore&s;ight and unanimity; and executed with
that vigour and &s;pirit which de&s;ervedly rai&s;ed them high
in the e&s;teem of their country. They reduced the Nabob
to rea&s;onable terms of accommodation before they alarm|ed
the French; and now the power of the latter was de|&s;troyed
they entered upon mea&s;ures to oblige the treache|rous
viceroy to a &s;trict performance of the treaty he had
&s;o lately &s;igned. However &s;pecious his promi&s;es were, they
$ound him extremely dilatory in the execution of &s;everal
articles of the treaty, which, in effect, was the &s;ame to
the Engli&s;h commerce as if none had been concluded.
The company's goods were loaded with high duties, and
&s;everal other infractions of the peace committed, upon
&s;uch frivolous pretences as evidently demon&s;trated that
he &s;ought to come to an open rupture as &s;oon as his pro|jects
were ripe for execution. In a word, he di&s;covered all
along a manife&s;t partiality to the French, who&s;e emi&s;&s;a|ries
cajoled him with promi&s;es that he &s;hould be joined
by &s;uch a body of their European troops, under M. de
Bu&s;&s;y, as would enable him to cru&s;h the power of the Eng|li&s;h,
whom they had taught him to fear and to hate. As
recommencing ho&s;tilities again&s;t &s;o powerful a prince was
in it&s;elf dangerous, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to be avoided, the
a$$air was laid before the council of Calcutta, and can|va&s;&s;ed
<PB N="111" REF="113">
with all the circum&s;pection and caution that a mea|&s;ure
required, on which depended the fate of the whole
trade of Bengal. Mr. Watts from time to time &s;ent them
intelligence of every tran&s;action in the Suba's cabinet,
and although that prince publickly declared he would
cau&s;e him to be impaled as &s;oon as the Engli&s;h troops
&s;hould be put in motion within the kingdom of Bengal, he
bravely &s;acrificed his own &s;afety to the intere&s;t of the com|pany,
and exhorted them to proceed with vigour in their
military operations. During the&s;e deliberations a mo&s;t for|tunate
incident occurred, that &s;oon determined the coun|cil
to come to an open rupture. The leading per&s;ons in
the Viceroy's court found them&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed by his
haughtine&s;s and in&s;olence. The &s;ame &s;pirit of di&s;content
appeared among the principal officers of his army: they
were well acquainted with his perfidy, &s;aw his preparations
for war, and were &s;en&s;ible that the peace of the country
could never be re&s;tored, unle&s;s either the Engli&s;h were
expelled or the Nabob depo&s;ed. In con&s;equence, a plan
was concerted for dive&s;ting him of all his power; and the
con&s;piracy was conducted by Ja&s;&s;ier Ali Khan, his prime
mini&s;ter and chief commander, a nobleman of great in|fluence
and authority in the province. The project was
communicated by Ali Khan to Mr. Watts, and &s;o im|proved
by the addre&s;s of that gentleman as in a manner to
en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. A treaty was actually concluded between
this Meer Ja&s;&s;ier Ali Khan and the Engli&s;h company;
and a plan concerted with this nobleman and the other
malecontents for their defection from the Viceroy. The&s;e
previous mea&s;ures being taken, Colonel Clive was ordered
to take the field with his little army. Admiral Wat&s;on
undertook the defence of Chandernagore, and the garri&s;on
was detached to re-enforce the Colonel, together with fifty
&s;eamen to be employed as gunners, and in directing the
artillery. Then Mr. Watts, deceiving the Suba's &s;pies,
by whom he was &s;urrounded, withdrew him&s;elf from
Muxadavad, and reached the Engli&s;h camp in &s;afety. On
the nineteenth of June a detachment was &s;ent to attack
<PB N="112" REF="114">
Cutwa fort and town, &s;ituated on that branch of the river
forming the i&s;land Ca&s;&s;imbuzar. This place &s;urrendered
at the fir&s;t &s;ummons; and here the Colonel halted with
the army for three days, expecting advices from Ali Khan&punc;
Di&s;appointed of the hoped-for intelligence he cro&s;&s;ed the
river, and marched to Plai&s;&s;ey, where he encamped. On
the twenty-third, at day-break, the Suba advanced to
attack him, at the head of fifteen thou&s;and hor&s;e, and near
thirty thou&s;and infantry, with about forty pieces of heavy
cannon, conducted and managed by French gunners, on
who&s;e courage and dexterity he placed great dependance.
They began to cannonade the Engli&s;h camp about &s;ix in
the morning, but a &s;evere &s;hower falling at noon they
withdrew their artillery. Colonel Clive &s;ei&s;ed this oppor|tunity
to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a tank and two other po&s;ts of
con&s;equence, which they in vain endeavoured to retake.
Then he &s;tormed an angle of their camp, covered with a
double brea&s;t-work, together with an eminence which they
occupied. At the beginning of this attack, &s;ome of their
chiefs being &s;lain, the men were &s;o di&s;pirited that they
&s;oon gave way; but &s;till Meer Ja&s;&s;ier Ali Khan, who com|manded
their left wing, forbore declaring him&s;elf openly.
After a &s;hort conte&s;t the enemy were put to flight, the
Nabob's camp, baggage, and fifty pieces of cannon ta|ken,
and a mo&s;t complete victory obtained. The Colonel
pur&s;uing his advantage, marched to Muxadavad, the ca|pital
of the province, and was there joined by Ali Khan
and the mal-contents. It was before concerted that this
nobleman &s;hould be inve&s;ted with the dignity of Nabob;
accordingly, the Colonel proceeded &s;olemnly to depo&s;e
Surajah Dowlat, and, with the &s;ame ceremony, to &s;ub&s;ti|tute
Ali Khan in his room, who was publickly acknow|ledged
by the people as Suba, or Viceroy, of the provin|ces
of Bengal, Bahar, and Orixa. Soon after, the late
Viceroy was taken, and put to death by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who
readily complied with all the conditions of his eleva|tion.
He conferred on his allies very liberal rewards, and
granted the company &s;uch extraordinary privileges a$
<PB N="113" REF="115">
fully demon&s;trated how ju&s;tly he merited their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
By this alliance, and the reduction of Chandernagore, the
French were entirely excluded the commerce of Bengal
and its dependencies; the trade of the Engli&s;h company
was re&s;tored, and increa&s;ed beyond their mo&s;t &s;anguine
hopes; a new ally was acquired, who&s;e intere&s;t obliged
him to remain firm to his engagements; a va&s;t &s;um was
paid to the company and the &s;ufferers at Calcutta, to in|demnify
them for their lo&s;&s;es; the &s;oldiers and &s;eamen were
gratified with &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds, as a reward
for the courage and intrepidity they exerted; and a variety
of other advantages gained, which it would be unnece&s;&s;ary
to enumerate. In a word, in the &s;pace of fourteen days a
great revolution was effected, and the government of a va&s;t
country, &s;uperior in wealth, fertility, extent, and number
of inhabitants to mo&s;t European kingdoms, transferred
by a handful of troops, conducted by an officer untu|tored
in the art of war, and a general rather by intuition
than in&s;truction and experience. But the public joy at
the&s;e &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es was con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by the
death of Admiral Wat&s;on, and the lo&s;s of Vizagapatam,
an Engli&s;h &s;ettlement on the Coromandel coa&s;t. The
Admiral fell a victim to the unwhole&s;omene&s;s of the cli|mate,
on the &s;ixteenth of Augu&s;t, univer&s;ally e&s;teemed
and regretted; and the factory and fort at Vizagapatam
were &s;urrendered to the French, a few days after Colonel
Clive had defeated the Nabob.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. We now turn our eyes to the continent of
Europe, where we &s;ee the beginning of the year marked
with a &s;triking in&s;tance of the dreadful effects of frantick
enthu&s;ia&s;m. France had long enjoyed a monarch, ea&s;y,
complying, good natured, and aver&s;e to all that wore the
appearance of bu&s;ine&s;s or of war. Contented with the
plea&s;ures of indolence, he &s;ought no greatne&s;s beyond what
he enjoyed, nor pur&s;ued any ambitious aim through the
dictates of his own di&s;po&s;ition. Of all men on earth &s;uch
a prince had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to expect an exemption
from plots again&s;t his per&s;on, and cabals among his &s;ub|jects;
<PB N="114" REF="116">
yet was an attempt made upon his life by a man, who$
though placed in the lowe&s;t &s;phere of fortune, had re&s;o$lution
to face the greate&s;t dangers, and enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;uffi$cient
to &s;u&s;tain, without &s;hrinking, all the tortures whic$
the cruelty of man could invent, or his crimes render ne$ce&s;&s;ary.
The name of this fanatick was Robert Franci$
Damien, born in the &s;uburb of St. Catharine, in the
city of Arras. He had lived in the &s;ervice of &s;everal fami|lies,
whence he was generally di&s;mi&s;&s;ed on account of the
impatience, the melancholy, and &s;ullenne&s;s of his di&s;po|&s;ition.
So humble was the &s;tation of a per&s;on, who was
re&s;olved to &s;tep forth from ob&s;curity, and, by one de&s;pe|rate
effort, draw upon him&s;elf the attention of all Europe.
On the fifth day of January, as the King was &s;tepping
into his coach, to return to Trianon, whence he had
that day come to Ver&s;ailles, Damien, mingling among his
attendants, &s;tabbed him with a knife on the right &s;ide,
between the fourth and fifth ribs. His Maje&s;ty, applying
his hand immediately to his &s;ide, cried out, &ldquo;I am
wounded! Seize him; but do not hurt him.&rdquo; Happi|ly,
the wound was not dangerous; as the knife, taking an
oblique direction, mi&s;&s;ed the vital parts. As for the a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in,
he made no attempts to e&s;cape; but &s;uffering him|&s;elf
quietly to be &s;eized, was conveyed to the guard-room,
where being interrogated if he committed the horrid action,
he boldly an&s;wered in the affirmative. A proce&s;s again&s;t
him was in&s;tantly commenced at Ver&s;ailles: many per&s;ons,
&s;uppo&s;ed acce&s;&s;aries to the de&s;ign upon the King's life,
were &s;ent to the Ba&s;tile; the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in him&s;elf was put to
the torture, and the mo&s;t excruciating torments were ap|plied,
with intention to extort a confe&s;&s;ion of the rea|&s;ons
that could induce him to &s;o execrable an attempt upon
his &s;overeign. Inci&s;ions were made into the mu&s;cular
parts of his legs, arms, and thighs, into which boiling
oil was poured. Every re$inement on cruelty, that human
invention could &s;ugge&s;t, was practi&s;ed without effect;
nothing could overcome his ob&s;tinacy; and his &s;ilence was
con&s;trued into a pre&s;umption, that he mu&s;t have had ac|complices
<PB N="115" REF="117">
in the plot. To render his puni&s;hment more
publick and con&s;picuous, he was removed to Paris, there
to undergo a repetition of all his former tortures, with
&s;uch additional circum&s;tances as the mo&s;t fertile and cruel
di&s;po&s;itions could devi&s;e for increa&s;ing his mi&s;ery and
torment. Being conducted to the Concergerie, an iron
bed, which likewi&s;e &s;erved for a chair, was prepared for
him, and to this he was fa&s;tened with chains. The
torture was again applied, and a phy&s;ician ordered to
attend, to &s;ee what degree of pain he could &s;upport.
Nothing, however, material was extorted; for what he
one moment confe&s;&s;ed, he recanted the next. It is not
within our province, and we con&s;ider it as a felicity, to
relate all the circum&s;tances of this cruel and tragical event.
Sufficient it is, that, after &s;uffering the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tor|ments
that human nature could invent, or man &s;upport,
his judges thought proper to terminate his mi&s;ery by a
death &s;hocking to imagination, and &s;hameful to humanity.
On the twenty-eighth day of March he was conducted,
amid&s;t a va&s;t concour&s;e of the populace, to the Greve,
the common place of execution, &s;tripped naked, and
fa&s;tened to the &s;eaffold by iron gyves. One of his hands
was then burnt in liquid flaming &s;ulphur, his thighs, legs,
and arms were torn with red hot pincers; boiling oil,
melted lead, re&s;in, and &s;ulphur, were poured into the
wounds; tight ligatures tied round his limbs to prepare
him for di&s;memberment; young and vigorous hor&s;es ap|plied
to the draft, and the unhappy criminal pulled with
all their force to the utmo&s;t exten&s;ion of his &s;inews for the
&s;pace of an hour, during all which time he pre&s;erved his
&s;en&s;es and con&s;tancy. At length the phy&s;ician and
&s;urgeon attending declared it would be impo&s;&s;ible to
accompli&s;h the di&s;memberment, unle&s;s the tendons
were &s;eparated: upon which orders were given to the
executioner to cut the &s;inews at the joints of the arms and
legs. The hor&s;es drew afre&s;h: a thigh and an arm were
&s;eparated, and, after &s;everal pulls, the unfortunate wretch
expired under the extremity of pain. His body and limbs
<PB N="116" REF="118">
were reduced to a&s;hes under the &s;caffold; his father, wife,
daughter, and family bani&s;hed the kingdom for ever; the
name of Damien effaced and obliterated, and the innocent
involved in the puni&s;hment of the guilty. Thus ended
the procedure again&s;t Damien and his family, in a manner
not very favourable to the avowed clemency of Louis, or
the acknowledged humanity of the French nation. It
appeared from undoubted evidence, that the attempt on
the King's life was the re&s;ult of in&s;anity, and a di&s;turbed
imagination. Several in&s;tances of a di&s;ordered mind had
before been ob&s;erved in his conduct, and the dete&s;tation
ju&s;tly due to the enormity of his crime ought now to have
been ab&s;orbed in the con&s;ideration of his misfortune, the
greate&s;t that can befal human nature.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. Another remarkable event in France, in the
beginning of this year, was the change in the mini&s;try of
that nation, by the removal of M. de Machault, keeper
of the &s;eals, from the po&s;t of &s;ecretary of &s;tate for the
marine; and of M. d'Argen&s;on from that of &s;ecretary at
war. Their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion was &s;udden and unexpected; nor
was any particular rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for this very unexpect|ed
alteration. The French King, to &s;hew the Queen of
Hungary how judiciou&s;ly &s;he had acted in forming an
alliance with the Hou&s;e of Bourbon, rai&s;ed two great
armies; the fir&s;t of which, compo&s;ed of near eighty thou|&s;and
men, the flower of the French troops, with a large
train of artillery, was commanded by M. d'Etr&eacute;es, a gene|ral
of great reputation; under whom &s;erved M. de Con|$ades,
M. Chevert, and the Count de St. Germain, all
officers of high character. This formidable army pa&s;&s;ed
the Rhine early in the Spring, and marched by We&s;tpha|lia,
in order to invade the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's dominions,
in quality of allies to the Empre&s;s-Queen, and guardians
of the liberties of the Empire. But their real view was to
invade Hanover, a &s;cheme which they knew would make a
powerful diver&s;ion of the Briti&s;h force from the pro&s;e|cution
of the war in other parts of the world, where the
&s;trength of France could not be fully exerted, and where
<PB N="117" REF="119">
their mo&s;t valuable intere&s;ts were at &s;take. They flattered
$hem&s;elves, moreover, that the &s;ame blow by which they
hoped to cru&s;h the King of Pru&s;&s;ia might likewi&s;e force
his Britannick Maje&s;ty into &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions with regard
to America. The other army of the French, commanded
by the Prince de Soubi&s;e, was de&s;tined to &s;trengthen the
Imperial army of execution, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-five
thou&s;and men, be&s;ides &s;ix thou&s;and Bavarians, and four
thou&s;and Wirtembergers. But before the&s;e troops, under
Soubi&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters
of &s;everal places belonging to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia upon the
borders of the Low Countries<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The K&mdash;of P&mdash;a had withdrawn his garri&s;on from Cleves, not without &s;u&s;picion of having purpo&s;ely left this door open to the enemy, that their irruption into G&mdash;y might ha&s;ten the re&s;olutions of the B&mdash;h m&mdash;y.</NOTE>; whil&s;t a detachment
from d'Etrees's army &s;ei&s;ed upon the town of Embden,
and whatever el&s;e belonged to the &s;ame monarch in Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. At the clo&s;e of the la&s;t campaign, the King
of Pru&s;&s;ia, having gained a petty advantage over the Im|periali&s;ts
under the command of Mare&s;chal Brown, and
incorporated into his own troops a great part of the Saxon
army taken pri&s;oners at Pirna, as was ob&s;erved before,
retired into winter-quarters until the &s;ea&s;on &s;hould permit
him to improve the&s;e advantages. His Maje&s;ty and Mare&s;|chal
Keith wintered in Saxony, having their cantonments
between Pirna and the frontier along the Elbe; and
Mare&s;chal Schwerin, returning into Sile&s;ia, took up his
quarters in the country of Glatz. In the mean time, the
Empre&s;s-Queen, finding the force which &s;he had &s;ent out
again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was not &s;ufficient to prevent
his de&s;igns, made the nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;itions to her allies
for the auxiliaries they had engaged to furni&s;h. In con&s;e|quence
of the&s;e requi&s;itions, the Czarina, true to her
engagements, di&s;patched above an hundred thou&s;and of
her troops, who began their march in the month of No|vember,
and proceeded to the borders of Lithuania, with
de&s;ign particularly to invade Ducal Pru&s;&s;ia, whil&s;t a &s;trong
<PB N="118" REF="120">
fleet was equipped in the Baltick, to aid the operations
of this numerous army. The Au&s;trian army a&s;&s;embled
in Bohemia amounted to upwards of four-&s;core thou&s;and
men, commanded by Prince Charles of Lorraine and
Mare&s;chal Brown. The Swedes had not yet openly de|clared
them&s;elves; but it was well known, that though
their king was allied in blood and inclination to his
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, yet the jealou&s;y which the &s;enate of
Sweden entertained of their &s;overeign, and the hope of
recovering their ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Pom$rania, by me $ns
of the pre&s;ent troubles, together with their old attachment
to France, newly cemented by intrigues and &s;ub&s;idies,
would certainly induce them to join in the general confede|racy.
The Duke of Mecklenbourgh took the &s;ame party,
and agreed to join the Swedi&s;h army, when it &s;hould be
a&s;&s;embled, with &s;ix thou&s;and men. Be&s;ides all the&s;e pre|parations
again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, he was, in his quality
of Elector of Brandenbourg, put under the ban of the Empire
by the aulick council; declared deprived of all his rights,
privileges, and prerogatives; his fiefs were e&s;cheated into the
exchequer of the Empire; and all the circles accordingly
ordered to furni&s;h their re&s;pective contingencies for putting
this &s;entence in execution.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. In this dangerous &s;ituation, thus mounced
on all &s;ides, and &s;eemingly on the very brink of inevita$le
de&s;truction, the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch owed his pre&s;ervation to
his own courage and activity. The Ru&s;&s;ians, knowing
that the country they were to pa&s;s through in their way
to Lithuania would not be able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t their prodigious
numbers, had taken care to furni&s;h them&s;elves with provi|&s;ions
for their march, depending upon the re&s;ources they
expected to find in Lithuania, after their arrival in that
country. The&s;e provi&s;ions were exhau&s;ted by the time
they reached the borders of that province, where they
found them&s;elves &s;uddenly and unexpectedly de&s;titute of
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence, either to return back or to proceed forward.
The King of Pru&s;&s;ia had, with great prudence and fore|&s;ight,
&s;ecured plenty to him&s;elf, and di&s;tre&s;s and famine
<PB N="119" REF="121">
to his enemies, by buying up all the corn and forage of
the country which the&s;e la&s;t were entering. Notwith|&s;tanding
the&s;e precautions, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, to guard
is much as could be again&s;t every po&s;&s;ible event, &s;ent a
great number of gunners and matro&s;&s;es from Pomerania
to Memel, with three regiments of his troops, to re-en|force
the garri&s;on of that place. He vi&s;ited all the po&s;ts
which his troops po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Sile&s;ia, and gave the nece&s;|&s;ary
orders for their &s;ecurity. He repaired to Nei&s;s, where
he &s;ettled with Mare&s;chal Schwerin the general plan of
the operations of the approaching campaign. There it
was agreed, that the mare&s;chal's army in Sile&s;ia, which
con&s;i&s;ted of fifty thou&s;and men, &s;hould have in con&s;tant
view the motions of the royal army, by which its own
were to be regulated, that they might both act in concert,
as circum&s;tances &s;hould require. At the &s;ame time, other
armies were a&s;&s;embled by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in Lu&s;atia
and Voigtland; twenty thou&s;and men were collected at
Zwickaw, on the frontiers of Bohemia, towards Egra,
under the command of Prince Maurice of A$halt-De&s;&s;au;
and &s;ixty thou&s;and cho&s;en troops began their march to|wards
Great Zeidlitz, where their head-quarters were &s;et|tled.
In the mean while, the Au&s;trian troops began to form
on the frontiers of Saxony, where &s;ome of their detach|ments
appeared, to watch the motions of the Pru&s;&s;ians, who
&s;till continued to pur&s;ue their operations with great acti|vity
and re&s;olution. All po&s;&s;ible care was taken by the Pru&s;|&s;ians
at Dre&s;den to &s;ecure a retreat, in ca&s;e of a de$ea$.
As only one regiment of Pru&s;&s;ians could be &s;pared to re|main
there in garri&s;on, the burghers were di&s;armed, their
arms depo&s;ited in the ar&s;enal, and a detachment was po&s;t|ed
at Konig&s;tein, to oblige that fortre&s;s to ob&s;erve a &s;trict
neutrality. All corre&s;pondence with the enemy was &s;trictly
prohibited; and it having been di&s;covered that the Coun|te&s;s
of Ogilive, one of the Queen's maids of honour, had
di&s;obeyed his Maje&s;ty's commands, &s;he was arre&s;ted; but
on the Queen's interce&s;&s;ion, afterwards relea&s;ed. The
Counte&s;s of Bruhi, lady of the Saxon prime mini&s;ter,
<PB N="120" REF="122">
was al&s;o arre&s;ted by his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's order; and, on
her making light of her confinement, and re&s;olving to
&s;ee company, &s;he was ordered to quit the court, and re|tire
from Saxony. M. Henwin, the French Mini&s;ter, was
told that his pre&s;ence was unnece&s;&s;ary at Dre&s;den; and
on his replying, that his ma&s;ter had commanded him to
&s;tay, he was again de&s;ired to depart; on which he
thought proper to obey. The Count de Waekerbath, mi|ni&s;ter
of the cabinet, and grand ma&s;ter of the hou&s;ehold to
the Prince Royal of Poland, was arre&s;ted, and conducted
to Cu&s;trin, by the expre&s;s command of his Maje&s;ty.
The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, having thrown two bridges over the
Elbe early in the &s;pring, ordered the &s;everal di&s;tricts of
the electorate of Saxony to &s;upply him with a great num|ber
of waggons, each drawn by four hor&s;es. The circles
of Mi&s;nia and Leip&s;ick were enjoined to furni&s;h four hun|dred
each, and the other circles in proportion.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. While the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was taking the&s;e
mea&s;ures in Saxony, two &s;kirmi&s;hes happened on the
frontiers of Bohemia, between his troops and the Au&s;tri|ans.
On the twentieth of February, a body of &s;ix thou&s;and
Au&s;trians &s;urrounded the little town of Hir&s;cfield in Up|per
Lu&s;atia, garri&s;oned by a battalion of Pru&s;&s;ian foot. The
fir&s;t attack was made at four in the morning, on two re|doubts
without the gates, each of which was defended by
two field pieces: and though the Au&s;trians were &s;everal
times repul&s;ed, they at la&s;t made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of one
of the redoubts, and carried off the two pieces of cannon.
In their retreat they were pur&s;ued by the Pru&s;&s;ians,
who fell upon their rear, killed &s;ome, and took many
pri&s;oners; this affair co&s;t the Au&s;trians at lea&s;t &s;ive hun|dred
men. About a fortnight after the Prince of Bevern
marched out of Zittau, with a body of near nine thou|&s;and
men, in order to de&s;troy the remaining &s;trong holds
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Au&s;trians on the frontiers. In this expe|dition
he took the Au&s;trian magazine at Friedland in Bo|hemia,
con&s;i&s;ting of nine thou&s;and &s;acks of meal, and
great &s;tore of ammunition; and, after making him&s;elf
<PB N="121" REF="123">
ma&s;ter of Reichenberg, he returned to Zittau. The van
of his troops, con&s;i&s;ting of a hundred and fifty hu&s;&s;ars of
the regiment of Putkammer, met with a body of &s;ix hun|dred
Croats, &s;u&s;tained by two hundred Au&s;trian dragoons
of Bathiana, at their entering Bohemia; and immediately
fell upon them &s;word in hand, killed about fifty, took
thirty hor&s;es, and made ten dragoons pri&s;oners. The
Pru&s;&s;ians, it is &s;aid, did not lo&s;e a &s;ingle man on this oc|ca&s;ion;
and two &s;oldiers only were &s;lightly wounded, the
Au&s;trians having made but a &s;light re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. Whatever the conduct of the court of Vienna
might have been to the allies of Great-Britain, &s;till, how|ever,
proper regard was &s;hown to the &s;ubjects of this
crown: for an edict was publi&s;hed at Florence on the
thirteenth of February, wherein his Imperial Maje&s;ty, as
Grand Duke of Tu&s;cany, declared his intention of ob|&s;erving
the mo&s;t &s;crupulous neutrality in the then &s;itua|tion
of affairs. All the ports in that duchy were accord|ingly
enjoyned to pay a &s;trict regard to this declaration, in
all ca&s;es relating to the French or Engli&s;h &s;hips in the
Mediterranean. The good effects of this injunction &s;oon
appeared; for two prizes taken by the Engli&s;h having put
into Porto Ferraro, the captains of two French privateers
addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to the governor, alledging, that they
were captures of a pirate, and reque&s;ting that they might
be obliged to put to &s;ea: but the governor prudently
replied, That as they came in under Engli&s;h colours he
would protect them; and forbad the privateers, at their
peril, to commit any violence. They, however, little
regarding the governor's orders, prepared for &s;ailing, and
&s;ent their boats to cut out one of the prizes. The captain
firing at their boats, killed one of their men, which alarm|ing
the &s;entinels, notice was &s;ent to the governor; and he,
in con&s;equence, ordered the two privateers immediately to
depart.&mdash;The conduct of the Dutch was rather cautious
than &s;pirited. Whil&s;t his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was employed
on the &s;ide of Bohemia and Saxony, the French auxili|$ries
began their march to harra&s;s his defen&s;ele&s;s territories
<PB N="122" REF="124">
in the neighbourhood of the Low Countries. A free
pa&s;&s;age was demanded of the States-General through
Namur and Mae&s;tricht, for the provi&s;ions, ammunition,
and artillery belonging to this new army; and though
the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador remon&s;trated again&s;t their compli|ance,
and repre&s;ented it as a breach of the neutrality
their High Mightine&s;&s;es declared they would ob&s;erve, yet,
after &s;ome he&s;itation, the demand was granted; and their
inability to prevent the pa&s;&s;age of the French troops,
&s;hould it be attempted by force, pleaded in excu&s;e of their
conduct.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. Scarce had the French army, commanded by
the Prince de Soubi&s;e, &s;et foot in the territories of Juli$$s
and Cologn, when they found them&s;elves in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the duchy of Cleves and the county of Mark, where all
things were left open to them, the Pru&s;&s;ians, who evacu|ated
their po&s;ts, taking their route along the river Lippe,
in order to join &s;ome regiments from Magdebourg, who
were &s;ent to facilitate their retreat. The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed inhabi|tants,
thus expo&s;ed to the calamities of war from an
unprovoked enemy, were in&s;tantly ordered to furni&s;h
contributions, $orage, and provi&s;ions, for the u&s;e of their
invaders; and, what was &s;till more terrifying to them,
the partizan Fi&s;cher, who&s;e cruelties, the la&s;t war, they
&s;till remembered with horrour, was again let loo&s;e upon
them by the inhumanity of the Empre&s;s-Queen. We$$l
was immediately occupied by the French: Emmerick and
Ma&s;eyk &s;oon &s;hared the &s;ame fate: and the city of Cu$|dres
was be&s;ieged, the Pru&s;&s;ians &s;eeming re&s;olved to de$end
this la&s;t place; to which end they opened the &s;luices, and
laid the country round under water. Tho&s;e who retreat|ed,
filing off to the north-we&s;t of Paderborn, entered the
county of Ritberg, the property of Count Kaunitz Rit|berg,
great chancellor to the Empre&s;s-Queen. After
taking his ca&s;tle, in which they &s;ound thirty pieces of
cannon, they rai&s;ed contributions in the di&s;trict, to the
amount of forty thou&s;and crowns. As the Pru&s;&s;ians re|tired,
the French took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country they
<PB N="123" REF="125">
quitted in the name of the Empre&s;s-Queen, who&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ary
attended them for that purpo&s;e. The general
rendezvous of the&s;e troops, under Prince Soubi&s;e, was
appointed at Neu&s;s, in the electorate of Cologn, where a
large body of French was a&s;&s;embled by the fir&s;t of April.
The Au&s;trians, in their turn, were not idle. Mar&s;hal
Brown vi&s;ited the fortifications of Brinn and Konin&s;gratz;
reviewed $he army of the late Prince Picolomini, now
under the command of General Serbelloni; and put his
own army in march for Ko&s;tlitz on the E&s;be, where he
propo&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h his head-quarters.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. During the rece&s;s of the armies, while the
rigours of winter forced them to &s;u&s;pend their ho&s;tile ope|rations,
and the greate&s;t preparations were making to open
the campaign with all po&s;&s;ible vigour, Count Be&s;tucheff,
great chancellor of Ru&s;&s;ia, wrote a circular letter to the
primate, &s;enators, and mini&s;ters of the republick of Po|land,
&s;ettin, forth, &startq;That the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia was
extremely affected with the King of Poland's di&s;tre&s;s,
which &s;he thought could not but excite the compa&s;&s;ion of
all other powers, but more e&s;pecially of his allies: That
the fatal con&s;equences which might re&s;ult from the ra&s;h
&s;tep taken by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, not only with re&s;pect to
the tranquility of Europe in general, but of each power
in particular, and more e&s;pe$i$lly of the neighbouring
countries, were &s;o evident, that the intere&s;t and &s;afety of
the &s;everal princes rendered it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary they
&s;hould make it a common cau&s;e: not only to obtain proper
&s;atisfaction for tho&s;e courts who&s;e dominions had been &s;o
unju&s;tly attacked, but likewi&s;e to pre&s;cribe &s;uch bounds
to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia as might &s;ecure them from any
future apprehen&s;ions from &s;o enterpri&s;ing and re&s;tle&s;s a
neighbour: that with this view, the Empre&s;s was deter|mined
to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King of Poland with a con&s;iderable body
of troops, which were actually upon their march<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This letter was written in December; and the Ru&s;&s;ians, as we ob|&s;erved before, began their march in November.</NOTE>, under
the command of General Apraxin; and that, as there
<PB N="124" REF="126">
would be an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for their marching through
part of the territories of Poland, her Imperial Maje&s;ty
hoped the republick would not fail to facilitate their march
as much as po&s;&s;ible.&endq; She further recommended to the
republick, to take &s;ome &s;alutary mea&s;ures for fru&s;trating
the de&s;igns of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and re&s;toring harmony
among them&s;elves, as the mo&s;t conducive mea&s;ure to the&s;e
good purpo&s;es. In this, however, the Poles were &s;o far
from following her advice, that, though &s;ure of being &s;a|crificed
in this conte&s;t, which &s;ide &s;oever prevailed, they
divided into parties with no le&s;s zeal than if they had as
much to hope from the prevalence of one &s;ide, as to fear
from that of the other. Some of the palatines were for
denying a pa&s;&s;age to the Ru&s;&s;ians, and others were for
affording them the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power.
With this cau&s;e of contention others of a more private
nature fatally concurred, by means of a mi&s;under&s;tanding
between the Prince Czartorin&s;ki and Count Mni&s;nec.
Almo&s;t every inhabitant of War&s;aw was involved in the
quarrel; and the violence of the&s;e factions was &s;o great,
that &s;carce a night pa&s;&s;ed without blood&s;hed, many dead
bodies, chiefly Saxons, being found in the &s;treets every
morning.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. In the mean time, Great-Britain, un&s;ettled
in her mini&s;try and councils at home, un&s;ucce&s;sful in her
attempts abroad, judging peace, if it could be obtained on
ju&s;t and honourable terms, more eligible than a continental
war, propo&s;ed &s;everal expedients to the Empre&s;s-Queen for
re&s;toring the tranquillity of Germany; but her an&s;wer was,
&startq;That whenever &s;he perceived that the expedients pro|po&s;ed
would indemnify her for the extraordinary expen&s;es
&s;he had incurred in her own defence, repair the heavy lo&s;&s;es
&s;u&s;tained by her ally the King of Poland, and afford a
proper &s;ecurity for their future &s;afety, &s;he would be ready
to give the &s;ame proofs &s;he had always given of her de&s;ire
to re&s;tore peace; but it could not be expected &s;he &s;hould
li&s;ten to expedients, of which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was to
reap the whole advantage, a$ter having begun the war,
<PB N="125" REF="127">
and wa&s;ted the dominions of a prince, who relied for his
&s;ecurity upon the faith of treaties, and the appearance of a
harmony between them.&endq; Upon the receipt of this an|&s;wer,
the court of London made &s;everal propo&s;als to the
Czarina, to interpo&s;e as mediatrix between the courts of
Vienna and Berlin, but they were rejected with marks of
di&s;plea&s;ure and re&s;entment. When Sir Charles Hanbury
Williams, the Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, continued to urge his
&s;ollicitations very &s;trongly, and even with &s;ome hints of
menaces, an an&s;wer was delivered to him by order of the
Empre&s;s, purporting, &startq;That her Imperial Maje&s;ty was
a&s;toni&s;hed at his demand, after he had already been made
acquainted with the mea&s;ures &s;he had taken to effect a re|conciliation
between the courts of Vienna and Berlin.
He might ea&s;ily conceive, as matters were then &s;ituated,
that the earne&s;tne&s;s with which he now urged the &s;ame
propo&s;ition mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;urpri&s;e her Imperial Maje&s;ty,
as it &s;howed but little regard to her former declaration.
The Empre&s;s, therefore, commanded his excellency to be
told, that as her intentions contained in her fir&s;t an&s;wer
remained ab&s;olutely invariable, no ulterior propo&s;itions for
a mediation would be li&s;tened to; and that as for the
menaces made u&s;e of by his excellency, and particularly
that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia him&s;elf would &s;oon attack the
Ru&s;&s;ian army, &s;uch threats &s;erved only to weaken the am|ba&s;&s;ador's
propo&s;als; to confirm &s;till more, were it po&s;&s;i|ble,
the Empre&s;s in her re&s;olutions; to ju&s;tify them to
the whole world, and to render the King of Pru&s;&s;ia
more blameable.&endq;</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. The &s;ea&s;on now drawing on in which the
troops of the contending powers would be able to take
the field, and the alarming progre&s;s of the Ru&s;&s;ians being
happily &s;topped, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who&s;e maxim it has
always been to keep the &s;eat of war as far as po&s;&s;ible from
his own dominions, re&s;olved to carry it into Bohemia, and
there to attack the Au&s;trians on all &s;ides. To this end
he ordered his armies in Saxony, Mi&s;nia, Lu&s;atia, and
Sile&s;ia to enter Bohemia in four different and oppo&s;ite
<PB N="126" REF="128">
places, nearly at the &s;ame time. The fir&s;t of the&s;e he
commanded in per&s;on, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mare&s;chal Keith; the
&s;econd was led by Prince Maurice of Anhalt-De&s;&s;au, the
third by Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick-Bevern, and the
fourth by Mare&s;chal Schwerin. In con&s;equence of this
plan, Mare&s;chal Schwerin's army entered Bohemia on the
eighteenth of April, in five columns, at as many different
places. The de&s;ign was &s;o well concerted, that the
Au&s;trians had not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of their approach till
they were pa&s;t the frontiers, and then they filled the dan|gerous
defile of Gulder-Oel&s;e with Pandours, to di&s;pute
that pa&s;&s;age; but they were no &s;ooner di&s;covered than
two battalions of Pru&s;&s;ian grenadiers attacked them with
their bayonets fixed, and routed them. The Prince of
Anhault pa&s;&s;ed the frontiers from Mi&s;nia, and penetrated
into Bohemia on the twenty-fir&s;t of April without any
re&s;i&s;tance. The Prince of Bevern, on the twentieth of
the &s;ame month, having marched at the head of a body of
the army, which was in Lu&s;atia, from the quarters of
cantonment near Zittau, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf immediately of
the fir&s;t po&s;t on the frontier of Bohemia, at Krottau and
Gra&s;en&s;tein, without the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle man: drove away
the enemy the &s;ame day from Kratzen, and proceeded to
Machendorf, near Reichenberg. The &s;ame morning
Putkammer's hu&s;&s;ars, who formed part of a corps, com|manded
by a colonel and major, routed &s;ome hundreds of
the enemy's cuira&s;&s;iers, po&s;ted before Cohlin, under the
conduct of Prince Lichten&s;tein, took three officers and
upwards of &s;ixty hor&s;e pri&s;oners, and &s;o di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t,
that they were &s;carcely able to rally near Kratzen. Night
coming on obliged the troops to remain in the open air till
the next morning, when, at break of day, the Pru&s;&s;ians
marched in two columns by Habendorf, towards the ene|my's
army, amounting to twenty-eight thou&s;and men,
commanded by Count Konig&s;eg, and po&s;ted near R$ichen|berg.
As &s;oon as the troops were formed they advanced
towards the enemy's cavalry, drawn up in three lines of
about thirty &s;quadrons. The two wings were &s;u&s;tained by
<PB N="127" REF="129">
the infantry, which was po&s;ted among $$lled trees and en|trenchments.
The Pru&s;&s;ians immediately cannonaded the
enemy's cavalry, who received it with re&s;olution, having
on their right hand a village, and on their left a wood,
where they had entrenched them&s;elves. But the Prince
of Bevern having cau&s;ed fifteen &s;quadrons of dragoons of
the &s;econd line to advance, and the wood on his right to
be attacked at the &s;ame time by the battalions of grenadiers
of Kahlden and of Moellendorf, and by the regiment of
the Prince of Pru&s;&s;ia, his dragoons, who, by clearing the
ground, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the entrenchments, had their flanks
covered, entirely routed the enemy's cavalry. In the mean
time Colonel Putkammer and Major Schenfeld, with their
hu$$ars, though flanked by the enemy's artillery, gave the
Au&s;trian hor&s;e-grenadiers a very warm reception, whil&s;t
General Le&s;tewitz, with the left wing of the Pru&s;&s;ians,
attacked the redoubts that covered Reichenberg. Though
there were many defiles and ri&s;ing grounds to pa&s;s, all oc|cupied
by the Au&s;trians, yet the regiment of Darm&s;tadt
forced the redoubt, and put to &s;light and pur&s;ued the
enemy, after &s;ome di&s;charge of their artillery and &s;mall
arms, from one eminence to another, for the di&s;tance of a
mile, when they left off the pur&s;uit. The action began at
half an hour after &s;ix, and continued till eleven. About
one thou&s;and of the Au&s;trians were killed and wounded,
among the former were General Porpora$i and Count
Hohenfelds, and among the latter Prince Lichton&s;tein and
Count Mansfeld. Twenty of their o$$icers, and four hun|dred
&s;oldiers, were taken pri&s;oners, and they al&s;o lo&s;t three
&s;tandards. On the &s;ide of the Pru&s;&s;ians &s;even &s;ubalterns
and about an hundred men were killed, and &s;ixteen officers
and an hundred and fifty men wounded. After this battle
Mare&s;chal Schwerin joined the Prince of Bevern, made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the greate&s;t part of the circle of Buntzlau,
and took a con&s;iderable magazine from the Au&s;trians,
whom he di&s;lodged. The Prince of Anhalt-De&s;&s;au, with
his corps, drew near the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's army, when the
latter advanced as far as Budin, from whence the Au|&s;trians,
<PB N="128" REF="130">
who had an advantageous camp there, retired to
We&s;twarn, half way between Budin and Prague; and his
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty having pa&s;&s;ed the Egra, his army, and
that of Mare&s;chal Schwerin, were &s;o &s;ituated as to be
able to act jointly.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. The&s;e advantages were but the prelude to a
much more deci&s;ive victory, which the King him&s;elf gained
a few days after. Preparing to enter Bohemia, at a di|&s;tance
from any of the corps commanded by his generals,
he made a movement as if he had intended to march to|wards
Egra. The enemy, deceived by this feint, and
imagining he was going to execute &s;ome de&s;ign, di&s;tinct
from the object of his other armies, detached a body of
twenty thou&s;and men to ob&s;erve his motions; then he
made a &s;udden and ma&s;terly movement to the left, by
which he cut off all communication between that detach|ment
and the main army of the Au&s;trians, which, having
been re-enforced by the army of Moravia, by the remains
of the corps lately defeated by the Prince of Bevern, and
by &s;everal regiments of the garri&s;on of Prague, amounted
to near a hundred thou&s;and men. They were &s;trongly
entrenched on the banks of the Moldaw, to the north of
Prague, in a camp &s;o fortified by every advantage of na|ture,
and every contrivance of art, as to be deemed almo$$
impregnable. The left wing of the Au&s;trians, thus
&s;ituated, was guarded by the mountains of Zi&s;cka, and
the right extended as far as Herboholi: Prince Charles of
Lorraine, and Mare&s;chal Brown, who commanded them
&s;eemed determined to maintain this advantageous po&s;t&punc;
but the King of Pru&s;&s;ia overlooked all difficulties. Having
thrown &s;everal bridges over the Moldaw on the fifth of
May, he pa&s;&s;ed that river in the morning of the &s;ixth&punc;
with thirty thou&s;and men, leaving the re&s;t of the army
under the command of the Prince of Anhault-De&s;&s;au&punc;
and being immediately joined by the troops unde$&punc;
Mare&s;chal Schwerin and the Prince of Bevern, re&s;olved
to attack the enemy on the &s;ame day. In con&s;equence of
this re&s;olution, his army filed off on the left by Pot&s;cher|nitz;
<PB N="129" REF="131">
and at the &s;ame time Count Brown wheeled to the
right, to avoid being flanked. The Pru&s;&s;ians continued
their march to Bichwitz, traver&s;ing &s;everal defiles and
mora&s;&s;es, which for a little time &s;eparated the infantry from
the re&s;t of the army. The foot began the attack too
precipitately, and were at fir&s;t repul&s;ed, but they &s;oon re|covered
them&s;elves. While the King of Pru&s;&s;ia took the
enemy in flank, Mare&s;chal Schwerin advanced to a
mar&s;hy ground, which &s;uddenly &s;topping his army,
threatened to di&s;concert the whole plan of operation. In
this emergency, he immediately di&s;mounted, and taking
the &s;tandard of the regiment in his hand, boldly entered
the mora&s;s, crying out, &startq;Let all brave Pru&s;&s;ians follow
me.&endq; In&s;pired by the example of this great commander,
now eighty-two years of age, all the troops pre&s;&s;ed for|ward,
and though he was unfortunately killed by the fir&s;t
fire, their ardour abated not till they had totally defeated
the enemy. Thus fell Mare&s;chal Schwerin, loaded with
years and glory, an officer who&s;e &s;uperior talents in the
military art had been di&s;played in a long cour&s;e of faith|ful
&s;ervice. In the mean time, the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry,
which had been &s;eparated in the march, forming them|&s;elves
afre&s;h, renewed the attack on the enemy's right, and
entirely broke it, while their cavalry, after three charges,
obliged that of the Au&s;trians to retire in great confu&s;ion,
the centre being at the &s;ame time totally routed. The
left wing of the Pru&s;&s;ians then marched immediately to|wards
Michely, and being there joined by the hor&s;e, re|newed
their attack, while the enemy were retreating
ha&s;tily towards Sa&s;zawar. Mean while the troops on the
right of the Pru&s;&s;ian army attacked the remains of the left
wing of the Au&s;trians, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of
three batteries. But the behaviour of the infantry in the
la&s;t attack was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, as to leave little room for this
part of the cavalry to act. Prince Henry of Pru&s;&s;ia, and
the Prince of Bevern, &s;ignali&s;ed them&s;elves on this occa|&s;ion
in &s;torming two batteries; Prince Ferdinand of
Brun&s;wick took the left wing of the Au&s;trians in flank,
<PB N="130" REF="132">
while the King with his le&s;t, and a body of cavalry, &s;e|cured
the pa&s;&s;age of the Moldaw. In &s;hort, after a very
long and ob&s;tinate engagement, and many &s;ignal examples
of valour on both &s;ides, the Au&s;trians were forced to aban|don
the field of battle, leaving behind &s;ixty pieces of can|non,
all their tents, baggage, military che&s;t, and, in a
word, their whole camp. The weight of the battle $$ll
upon the right wing of the Au&s;trians, the remains of
which, to the amount of ten or twelve thou&s;and m$n, fled
towards Bene&s;chau, where they afterwards a&s;&s;embled under
M. Pretlach, general of hor&s;e. The in$antry retired to|wards
Prague, and threw them&s;elves into that city, with
their commanders, Prince Charles of Lorraine and Mare$$|chat
Brown, but they were much harra&s;&s;ed in their re|treat
by a detachment of the Pru&s;&s;ians under Mare&s;chal
Keith. The Pru&s;&s;ians took, on this occa&s;ion, ten &s;tand|ards,
and upwards of four thou&s;and pri&s;oners, thirty of
whom were officers of rank. Their lo&s;s amounted to
about two thou&s;and five hundred killed, and about three
thou&s;and wounded. Among the former were General
d'Am&s;tel, the Prince of Hol&s;tein-Book, the Colonels
Goltze and Man&s;tein, and Lieutenant-Colonel Roke.
Among the latter, the Generals Wenter$ield, De la
Mothe, F$uque, Hautcharmoy, Blanken&s;ee, and Pletten|berg.
The number of the killed and wounded on the &s;ide
of the Au&s;trians was much greater. Among the&s;e la&s;t was
Mare&s;chal Brown, who received a wound, which, from
the chagrin he &s;uffered, rather than from its own nature,
proved mortal. The day after the battle, Colonel Meye$
was detached with a battalion of Pru&s;&s;ian Pandours, and
four hundred hu&s;&s;ars, to de&s;troy a very con&s;iderable and
valuable magazine of the Au&s;trians at Pil&s;en, and this &s;et|vice
he performed. He al&s;o completed the de&s;truction of
&s;everal others of le&s;s importance, by the lo&s;s of which,
however, all po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence was out off from
any &s;uccours the Au&s;trians might have expected from the
Empire.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="133">
&sect; XXXVI. The Pru&s;&s;ians, following their blow, im|mediately
inve&s;ted Prague on both &s;ides of the river, the
King commanding on one &s;ide, and Mare&s;chal Keith on
the other. In four days the whole city was &s;urrounded
with lines and entrenchments, by which all communica|tion
from without was entirely cut off: Prince Charles
of Lorraine and Mare&s;chal Brown, the two Princes of
Saxony, the Prince of Modena, the Duke d'Aremberg,
Count Lacy, and &s;everal other per&s;ons of great di&s;tinction
were &s;hut up within the walls, together with above twenty
thou&s;and of the Au&s;trian army, who had taken refuge in
Prague after their defeat. Every thing continued quiet on
both &s;ides, &s;carce a cannon &s;hot being &s;ired by either for
&s;ome time after this blockade was formed; and in the mean
while the Pru&s;&s;ians made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Czi&s;ca|berg,
an eminence which commands the town, where
the Au&s;trians had a &s;trong redoubt, continuing likewi&s;e to
&s;trengthen their works. Already they had made a &s;ally,
and taken &s;ome other ineffectual &s;teps to recover this po&s;t,
but a more deci&s;ive &s;troke was nece&s;&s;ary. Accordingly, a
de&s;ign was formed of attacking the Pru&s;&s;ian army in the
night with a body of twelve thou&s;and men, to be &s;u&s;tained
by all the grenadiers, volunteers, Pandours, and Hunga|rian
infantry. In ca&s;e an impre&s;&s;ion could be made on
the King's lines, it was intended to open a way, &s;word
in hand, through the camp of the befiegers, and to ea&s;e
Prague of the multitude of forces locked up u&s;ele&s;s within
the walls, &s;erving only to con&s;ume the provi&s;ions of the
garri&s;on, and ha&s;ten the &s;urrender of the place. Happily
a de&s;erter gave the Prince of Pru&s;&s;ia intelligence of the
enemy's de&s;ign about eleven o'clock at night. Proper
mea&s;ures were immediately taken for their reception, and
in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour the whole army was under
arms. This de&s;ign was conducted with &s;o much &s;ilence,
that though the Pru&s;&s;ians were warned of it they could
di&s;cover nothing before the enemy had charged their ad|vanced
po&s;ts. The attack was begun on the &s;ide of the
little town, again&s;t Mare&s;chal Keith's camp, and the left
<PB N="132" REF="134">
wing of the Pru&s;&s;ian army encamped on the Moidaw.
From hence it is probable the Au&s;trians propo&s;ed not only
to de&s;troy the batteries that were rai&s;ing, but to attack the
bridges of communication which the Pru&s;&s;ians threw over
the Moldaw, at about a quarter of a German mile above
and below Prague, at Branick and Bodbaba. The greate&s;t
alarm began about two o'clock, when the enemy hoped to
have come &s;ilently and unexpectedly upon the miners,
but they had left work about a quarter of an hour before.
At the report of the fir&s;t piece which they fired, the piq$$t
of the third battalion of Pru&s;&s;ian guards, to the number
of an hundred men, who marched out of the camp to &s;u|&s;lain
the body which covered the works, was thrown into
&s;ome confu&s;ion, from the darkne&s;s of the night, which
prevented their di&s;tingui&s;hing the Au&s;trian troops from
their own. Lieutenant Jork, detached with two pla|toons
to reconnoitre the enemy, attempting to di&s;cover
their di&s;po&s;ition by kindling a fire, Captain Rodig, by
the light of this fire, perceiving the enemy's &s;ituation,
immediately formed the de&s;ign of falling upon them in
flank, and gave orders to his men to fire in platoons.
which they performed, mutually repeating the &s;ignal given
by their commander. The enemy fled with the gre$ter
precipitation, as they were ignorant of the weakne&s;s of
the piquet, and as the &s;houting of the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers
made them mi&s;take it for a numerous body, many of
them de&s;erted, many took &s;helter in Prague, and many
more were driven into the river and drowned. At the
&s;ame time this attack began, a regiment of hor&s;e-grenadiers
fell upon a redoubt which the Pru&s;&s;ians had thrown up,
&s;upported by the Hungarian infantry: they returned
three times to the a&s;&s;ault, and were as often beat back by
the Pru&s;&s;ians, whom they found it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;lodge;
though Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick's battalion, which
guarded this po&s;t, &s;uffered extremely. During this attack
the enemy kept an ince&s;&s;ant fire with their mu&s;que$ry
upon &s;he whole front of the Pru&s;&s;ians, from the convent of
St. Margaret to $he river. At three in the morning the
<PB N="133" REF="135">
Pru&s;&s;ians quitted their camp to engage the enemy. The
battalion of Parmewitz attacked a building called the Red-hou&s;e,
&s;ituated at the bottom of a declivity before Wel|la&s;towitz.
The Pandours, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
this hou&s;e, fired upon them ince&s;&s;$ntly from all the doors
and windows until they were di&s;lodged; and the Pru&s;&s;ian
battalions were obliged to &s;u&s;tain the fire both of cannon
and mu&s;quetry for above two hours, when the enemy
retired to the city, except the Pandours, who again took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Red-hou&s;e, which the Pru&s;&s;ians were
forced to abandon, becau&s;e the artillery of Prague kept a
continual fire upon it from the moment it, was known to
be in their hands. The Au&s;trians left&punc; behind them many
dead and wounded, be&s;ides de&s;erters, and the Pru&s;&s;ians,
notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s of &s;everal officers and private
men, made &s;ome pri&s;oners. Prince Ferdinand, the King
of Pru&s;&s;ia's younge&s;t brother, had a hor&s;e killed under
him, and was &s;lightly wounded in the face.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. The Pru&s;&s;ian works being complexed,
and heavy artillery arrived, four batteries erected on the
banks of the Mol$law, began to play with great fury.
Near three hundred bombs, be&s;ides an infinity of ignited
balls, were thrown into the city in the &s;pace of twenty-four
hours. The &s;cene was lamentable, hou&s;es, men, and
hor&s;es wrapped in flames, and reduced to a&s;hes. The
confu&s;ion within, together with the want of proper in|$$lery
and ammunition, obliged the Au&s;trians to cau&s;e
firing, and furni&s;hed his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty with all the op|portunity
he could wi&s;h of pouning de&s;truction upon this
unfortunate city. The horrours of war &s;eemed to have
extingui&s;hed the principles of humanity. No regard was
paid to the di&s;tre&s;s of the inhabitants, the Au&s;trians ob|&s;tinately
maintained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the Pru&s;&s;ians practi&s;ed
every &s;tratagem, every barbarous refinement that con&s;ti|tutes
the military art to oblige them no capitulate$. After
the con$lagration had la&s;ted three days, and confirmed a
prodigious number of buildings, the principal inhabitants,
burghers, and clergy, perceiving their city on the $word$ of
<PB N="134" REF="136">
being reduce! to a heap of rubbi&s;h, be&s;ought the com|mander,
in a body, to hearken to terms, but he was deaf
to the voice of pity, and, in&s;tead of being moved with
their &s;upplications, drove out twelve thou&s;and per&s;ons, the
lea&s;t u&s;eful in defending the city. The&s;e, by order of his
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, were again forced-back, which &s;oon
produced &s;o great a &s;carcity of provi&s;ion within the
walls, that the Au&s;trians were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of
eating hor&s;e-fle&s;h, forty hor&s;es being daily di&s;tributed to
the troops, and the &s;ame food &s;old at four-pence a pound
to the inhabitants. However, as there &s;till remained great
abundance of corn, they were far from being brought to
the la&s;t extremity. Two vigorous and well-conducted
&s;allies were made, but they proved un&s;ucce&s;sful. The
only advantage re&s;ulting from them was the perpetual
alarm in which they kept the Pru&s;&s;ian camp, and the
vigilance required to guard again&s;t the attacks of a nu|merous,
re&s;olute, and de&s;perate garri&s;on.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. Whatever difficulties might have attended
the conque&s;t of Prague, certain it is that the affairs of
the Empre&s;s-Queen were in the mo&s;t critical and de&s;pe|rate
&s;ituation. Her grand army di&s;per&s;ed in parties, and
flying for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in &s;mall corps; their princes and
commanders cooped up in Prague; that capital in immi|nent
danger of being taken, the flouri&s;hing kingdom of
Bohemia ready to fall into the hands of the conqueror, a
con&s;iderable army on the point of &s;urrendering pri&s;oners of
war; all the Queen's hereditary dominions open and ex|po&s;ed,
the whole fertile tract of country from Egra to the
Moldaw in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Pru&s;&s;ians, the di&s;tance
to the archduchy of Au&s;tria not very con&s;iderable, and
&s;ecured only by the Danube; Vienna under the utmo&s;t
apprehen&s;ions of a &s;iege, and the Imperial family ready
to take refuge in Hungary; the Pru&s;&s;ian $orces deemed
invincible, and the &s;anguine friends of that monarch al|ready
&s;haring with him, in imagination, the &s;poils of the
ancient and illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Such was the
a&s;pect of affairs, and &s;uch the difficulties to be combated,
<PB N="135" REF="137">
when Leopold, Count Daun, was appointed the com|mand
of the Au&s;trian forces, to &s;tern the torrent of di&s;|grace,
and turn the fortune of the war. This general,
tutored by long experience under the be&s;t officers of Eu|rope,
and the particular favourite of the great Kevenhuller,
was now, for the fir&s;t time, rai&s;ed to act in chief, at the
head of an army, on which depended the fate of Au&s;tria
and the empire. Born of a noble family, he relied &s;olely
upon his own merit, without &s;ollici$ing court favour; he
a&s;pired after the highe&s;t preferment, and &s;ucceeded by mere
dint of &s;uperior worth. His progre&s;s from the &s;tation of a
&s;ubaltern was &s;low and &s;ilent: his promotion to the chief
command was received with univer&s;al e&s;teem and applau&s;e
Cautious, &s;teady, penetrating, and fagacio$s, he was op|po&s;ed
as another Fabius to the modern Hannibal, to check
the fire and vigour of that monarch by prudent fore &s;ight
and wary circum&s;pection. Arriving at Boemi&s;ch h$od,
within a few miles of Prague, the day after the late defeat,
he halted to collect the fugitive corps and broken remains
of the Au&s;trian army, and &s;oon drew together a force &s;o
con&s;iderable as to attract the notice of his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty,
who detached the Prince of Bovern, with twenty
battalions and thirty &s;quadrous, to attack him before num|bers
&s;hould render him formidable. Daun was too pru|dent
to give battle with di&s;pirited troops to an army flu&s;hed
with victory. He retired on the fir&s;t advice that the
Pru&s;&s;ians were advancing, and took po&s;t at Ko$in, where
he entrenched him&s;elf &s;trongly, opened the way for the
daily &s;upply of recruits &s;ent to his army, and in&s;pired the
garri&s;on of Prague with fre&s;h courage, inexpectation of
being &s;oon relieved. Here he kept clo&s;e within his camp,
divided the Pru&s;&s;ian force by obliging the King to em|ploy
near half his army in watching his de&s;igns, weakened
his efforts again&s;t Prague, harra&s;&s;ed the enemy by eut$ing
off their convoys, and re&s;tored by degrees, the langui&s;hing
and almo&s;t de&s;ponding &s;pirits of his troops. Perfectly ac|quainted
with the and our and di&s;cipline of the $ru&s;&s;iam
$word$ with the enterpri&s;ing and impetu$$$ di&s;po&s;ition of
<PB N="136" REF="138">
that monarch, and &s;en&s;ible that his &s;ituation would prove
irk&s;ome and embarra&s;&s;ing to the enemy, he improved it to
the be&s;t advantage, &s;eemed to fore&s;ee all the con&s;equences,
and directed every me$&s;ure to produce them. Thus he
retarded the enemy's operations, and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly avoided
precipitating an action until the Pru&s;&s;ian vigour &s;hould
be exhau&s;ted, their &s;trength impaired by lo&s;&s;es and de&s;er|tion,
the fir&s;t fire and ardour of their genius extingui&s;hed by
continual fatigue and ince&s;&s;ant alarms, and until the im|pre&s;&s;ion
made on his own men, by the late defeat, &s;hould,
in &s;ome degree, be effaced. The event ju&s;tified Daun's
conduct. His army grew every day more numerous,
while his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty began to expre&s;s the utmo&s;t
impatience at the length of the &s;iege. When that mo|narch
fir&s;t inve&s;ted Prague, it was on the pre&s;umption that
the numerous forces within the walls would, by con&s;um|ing
all the provi&s;ion, oblige it to &s;urrender in a few
days, but perceiving that the Au&s;trians had &s;till a con&s;i|derable
quantity of corn, that Court Daun's army was
daily increa&s;ing, and would &s;oon be powerful enough not
only to cope with the detachment under the Prince of
Bevern, but in a condition to rai&s;e the &s;iege, he determined
to give the Count battle with one part of his army, while
he kept Prague blocked up with the other. The Au|&s;trians,
amounting now to &s;ixty thou&s;and men, were deeply
entrenched, and defended by a numerous train of artillery,
placed on redoubts and batteries erected on the mo&s;t ad|vantageous
po&s;ts. Every acce&s;&s;ible part of the camp was
fortified with lines and heavy pieces of battering cannon,
and the foot of the hills &s;ecured by difficult de$iles. Yet,
&s;trong as this &s;ituation might appear, formidable as the
Au&s;trian forces certainly were, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty under|took
to di&s;lodge them with a body of hor&s;e and foot not
exceeding thirty-two thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. On the thirteenth day of June, the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia quitted the camp before Prague,
e&s;corted by a few battalions and &s;quadrons, with
which he joined the Prince of Bevern at Milkowitz.
<PB N="137" REF="139">
Mare&s;chal Keith, it is &s;aid, &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed this mea|&s;ure,
and advi&s;ed either rai&s;ing the &s;iege entirely, and at|tacking
the Au&s;trians with the united forces of Pru&s;&s;ia, or
po&s;tponing the attack on the camp at Kolin until his Ma|je&s;ty
&s;hould either gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city, or &s;ome at|temps
&s;hould be made to oblige him to quit his po&s;ts.
From either mea&s;ure an advantage would have re&s;ulted.
With his whole army he might probably have defeated
Count Daun, or at lea&s;t have obliged him to retreat. Had
he continued within his lines at Prague, the Au&s;trian
general could not have con&s;trained him to rai&s;e the &s;iege
without lo&s;ing his own advantageous &s;ituation, and giving
battle upon terms nearly equal. But the King, elated
with &s;ucce&s;s, impetuous in his valour, and confident of
the &s;uperiority of his own troops in point of di&s;cipline,
thought all re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t &s;ink under the weight of his
victorious arm, and yield to that courage which had al|ready
&s;urmounted &s;uch difficulties, di&s;regarded the mare&s;|chal's
&s;age coun&s;el, and marched up to the attack un|daunted,
and even a&s;&s;ured of &s;ucce&s;s. By the eighteenth
the two armies were in &s;ight, and his Maje&s;ty found that
Count Daun had not only fortified his camp with all the
heavy cannon of Olmutz, but was &s;trongly re-enforced
with troops from Moravia and Au&s;tria, which had joined
him after the King's departure from Prague. He found
the Au&s;trians drawn up in three lines upon the high
grounds between Gentlitz and St. John the Bapti&s;t. Dif|ficult
as it was to approach their &s;ituation, the Pru&s;&s;ian
infantry marched up with firmne&s;s, while &s;hot was poured
$ike hail from the enemy's batteries, and began the attack
$bout three in the afternoon. They drove the Au&s;trians
with irre&s;i&s;tible intrepidity from two eminences &s;ecured
with heavy cannon, and two villages defended by &s;everal
$attalions; but, in attacking the third eminence, were
$anked by the Au&s;trian cavalry, by grape-&s;hot, poured
$rom the batteries; and, after a violent con$lict, and pro|ligious
lo&s;s of men, thrown into di&s;order. Animated with

Sazen$$imes &s;ucce&s;&s;ively did Prince Ferdinand renew the
attack, performing every duty of a great general and

inferiority of the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry, the di&s;advantages of
ground, where the cavalry could not act, the advantage on
$word$ of the enemy, their numerous artillery, their
entrenchments, numbers, and ob&s;tinacy, joined to the

in conver&s;ation with &s;everal of his general officers. Mo&s;t
people, indeed, imagined the King highly blameable for
checking the ardour of his troops, to &s;top and lay &s;iege to
Prague. They thought he &s;hould have pur&s;ued his con|que&s;ts,
over-run Au&s;tria, Moravia, and all the hereditary
dominions, from which alone the Empre&s;s-Queen could
draw &s;peedy &s;uccours. A body of twenty or thirty thou|&s;and
men would have blocked up Prague, while the remain|der
of the Pru&s;&s;ian forces might have obliged the Imperial
family to retire from Vienna, and effectually prevented
Count Daun from a&s;&s;embling another army. It was
univer&s;ally expected he would have bent his march &s;traight
to this capital, but he dreaded leaving the numerous army
in Prague behind, and it was of great importance to com|plete
the conque&s;t of Bohemia. The Prince of Pru&s;&s;ia
marched all night with his corps to Nimburg, where he
joined the Prince of Bevern, and Mare&s;chal Keith re|treated
<PB N="140" REF="142">
next day. Count Brown, having died before, of the
wounds he received on the &s;ixth of May, Prince Charles
of Lorraine failled out with a large body of the Au&s;trians,
and attacked the rear of the Pru&s;&s;ians $ but did no further
mi&s;chief than killing about two hundred of their men.
The &s;iege of Prague being thus rai&s;ed, the impri&s;oned
Au&s;trians received their deliverer, Count Daun, with in|expre&s;&s;ible
joy, and their united forces became greatly &s;u|perior
to tho&s;e of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who was in a &s;hort
time obliged to evacuate Bohemia, and take refuge in
Saxony. The Au&s;trians harra&s;&s;ed him as much as po&s;&s;ible
in his retreat; but their armies, though &s;uperior in num|bers,
were not in a condition, from their late &s;ufferings,
to make any deci&s;ive attempt upon him, as the frontiers of
Saxony abound with &s;ituations ea&s;ily defended.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. Having thus de&s;cribed the progre&s;s&punc; of the
Pru&s;&s;ians in Bohemia, we mu&s;t ca&s;t our eyes on the tran&s;|actions
which di&s;tingui&s;hed the campaign in We&s;tpha$$.
To guard again&s;t the &s;torm which menaced Hanover it
particular, orders were tran&s;mitted thither to recruit the
troops that had been &s;ent back from England, to augment
each company, to remount the cavalry with the utmo&s;t
expedition; not to &s;uffer any hor&s;es to be conveyed out of
the electorate; to furni&s;h the magazines in that country
w$$h all things nece&s;&s;ary for fifty thou&s;and men. Of $word$
twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and were to be Hanoverians, and, in
con&s;equences of engagements entered into for that perpo&s;e,
twelve thou&s;and He&s;&s;ians, &s;ix thou&s;and Brun&s;wicke$,
two thou&s;and Saxe-Gothans, and a thou&s;and Lu$en|burgh$rs,
to be joined by a con&s;iderable body of Pru&s;&s;ians,
the whole commanded by his royal highne&s;s the Duke of
Cumberland. The King of England having publi&s;hed a
manife&s;t$, $word$ at Hanover, &s;pecifying his motives for
taking the field in We&s;tphalia, the troops of the confede|rated
&s;tates that were to compo&s;e the allied a$any, under
the name of an army of ob&s;ervation, began to a&s;&s;emble
with all po&s;&s;ible diligence near Biclefeld$. That her the
generals appointed to command the &s;everal diri&s;ions
<PB N="141" REF="143">
$epaired, to &s;ettle the plan of operations with their com|mander,
the Duke of Cumberland, who, having le&s;t
London on the ninth of April, arrived on the &s;ixteenth
$t Hanover, and from thence repaired to the army, which,
having been joined by three Pru&s;&s;ian regiments that re|$ired
from We&s;el, con&s;i&s;ted of thirty-&s;even battalions and
thirty-four &s;quadrons. Of the&s;e &s;ix battalions and &s;ix
&s;quadrons were po&s;ted at Bielefeldt, under the command
of Lieutenant-General Baron de Sporcken; &s;ix battalions,
under Lieutenant-General de Block, at Hervorden; &s;ix
battalions and four &s;quadrons, under Major-General
Ledebour, between Hervorden and Minden; &s;even batta|lions
and ten &s;quadrons, under Lieutenant-General d'Oberg
in the neighbourhood of Hamelen; and &s;ive battalions
and four-&s;quadrons, under Major-General de Hau&s;s, near
Nienburgh. The head-quarters of his Royal Highne&s;s
were at Bielefeldt.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. In the mean time, the French on the Lower-Rhine
continued filing off ince&s;&s;antly. The &s;iege of
Gueldres was converted into a blockade, occa&s;ioned by
the difficulties the enemy found in rai&s;ing batteries; and
a party of Hanoverians having pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er, as well
to ravage the country of Paderbourn as to reconnoitre the
French, carried off &s;everal waggons loaded with wheat and
oats, de&s;tined for the territories of the Elector of Cologn.
On the other hand, Colonel Fi&s;cher having had an en|gagement
with a &s;mall body of Hanoverians, in the country
of Teklenburgh, routed them, and made &s;ome pri&s;oners.
After &s;everal other petty &s;kirmi&s;hes between the French
and the Hanoverians, the Duke of Cumberland altered
the po&s;ition of his camp, by placing it between Biele&s;eldt
and Hervorden, in hopes of fru&s;trating the de&s;ign of the
enemy; who, declining to attack him on the &s;ide of Brac|wede,
after having reconnoitred his &s;ituation &s;everal days,
made a motion on their left, as if they meant to get be|tween
him and the We&s;er. This &s;tep was no &s;ooner taken,
than, on the thirteenth of June in the afternoon, having
received advice that the enemy had cau&s;ed a large body of
<PB N="142" REF="144">
troops, followed by a &s;econd, to march on his right t$
Burghotte, he ordered his army to march that evenin$
towards Hervorden; and at the &s;ame time Major-Genera$
Hardenberg marched with four battalions of grenadiers
and a regiment of hor&s;e, to re-enforce that po&s;t. Coun$
Schulenberg covered the left of the march with a battalion$
of grenadiers, a regiment of hor&s;e, and the light troops of
Buckeburg. The whole army marched in two columns
The right, compo&s;ed of hor&s;e, and followed by two bat|talions,
to cover their pa&s;&s;age through the enclo&s;ures and
defiles, pa&s;&s;ed by the right of Bielefeldt; and the left,
con&s;i&s;ting of infantry, marched by the left of the &s;ame
town. The van-guard of the French army attacked the
rear-guard of the allies, commanded by Major-General
Einfiedel, very bri&s;kly, and at fir&s;t put them into &s;ome
confu&s;ion, but they immediately recovered them&s;elves.
This was in the beginning of the night. At break of day
the enemy's re-enforcements returned to the charge, but
were again repul&s;ed, nor could they once break through
Lieutenant Colonel Alfeldt's Hanoverian guards, which
clo&s;ed the army's march with a detachment of regular
troops, and a new-rai&s;ed corps of hunters.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. The allies encamped at Cofeldt the four|teenth,
and remained there all the next day, when the
enemy's detachments advanced to the gates of Hervorden,
and made a feint as if they would attack the town, after
having &s;ummoned it to &s;urrender; but they retired with|out
attempting any thing further; and, in the mean time,
the troops that were po&s;ted at Hervorden, and formed the
rear-guard, pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er on the &s;ide of Remen, with|out
any mole&s;tation, and encamped at Holtzuy&s;en. A
body of troops which had been left at Biele&s;eldt, to cover
the Duke's retreat, after &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes with the French,
rejoined the army in the neighbourhood of Herfort; and
a few days after his Royal Highne&s;s drew near his bridges
on the We&s;er, and &s;ent over his artillery, baggage, and
ammunition. At the &s;ame time &s;ome detachments pa&s;&s;ed
the river on the right, between Minden and Oldendorp, and
<PB N="143" REF="145">
remarked out a new camp advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, having
the We&s;er in front, and the right and left covered with
$eminences and mar&s;hes. There the army under his royal
highne&s;s re-a&s;&s;embled, and the French fixed their head|quarters
at Bielefeldt, which the Hanoverins had quitted,
&s;eaving in it only part of a magazine, which had been &s;et
on fire. By this time the French were in &s;uch warn of
&s;orage, that M. d'Etr&eacute;es him&s;elf, the princes of the blood,
and all the officers without exception, were obliged to &s;$nd
back part of their hor&s;es. However, on the tenth of June
their whole army, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eventy battaliens and forty
&s;quadrons, with fifty-two pieces of cannon, be&s;ides a body
of cavalry left at Ruremonde for the conveniency of &s;orage
was put in motion. In &s;pite of almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible fore&s;ts,
famine, and every other ob&s;tacle that could be thrown in
their way by a vigilant and exprienced general, they at
length &s;urmounted all difficulties, and advanced into a
country abounding with plenty, and unu&s;ed to the ravages
of war. It was imagined that the pa&s;&s;age of the We&s;er,
which defends Hanover from foreign attacks, would have
been vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the army of the allies: but
whether, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, it was thought
advi&s;eable to act only upon the defen&s;ive, and not to begin
the attack in a country that was not concerned as a prin|cipal
in the war, or the Duke of Cumberland &s;ound him|&s;elf
too weak to make head again&s;t the enemy, is a que&s;tion
we &s;hall not pretend to determine. However that may
have been, the whole French army pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er on
the tenth an $ eleventh of July, without the lo&s;s of a man.
The manner of effecting this pa&s;&s;age is thus related:&mdash;Mare&s;chal
d'Etr&eacute;es being informed that his magazince of
provi&s;ions were well furni&s;hed, his ovens e&s;tabli&s;hed, and
the artillery and pontoons arrived at the de&s;tined places,
ordered Lieutenant-General Broglio, wi&s;h $en battalions,
twelve &s;quadrons, and ten pieces of cannon, to march to
Engheren; Lieutenant-General M. de Chevert, with &s;ixteen
battalions, three brig$des of carabinears, the royal hunters,
and &s;ix hundred hu&s;&s;ars, to march to Hervorden, and
<PB N="144" REF="146">
Lieutenant-General Marquis d'Armentieres, with twelve
battalions and ten &s;quadrons, to march to Ulrickhau&s;en.
All the&s;e troops being arrived in their camp on the fourth
of July, halted the fifth. On the &s;ixth, twenty-two bat|talions,
and thirty-two &s;quadrons, under the command o$
the Duke of Orleans, who was now arrived at the army
marched to Ulrickhau&s;en, from whence M. d'Armentiere
had &s;et out early in the morning, with the troops under hi$
command, and by ha&s;ty marches got on the &s;eventh, b$
eleven at night, to Blankenhoven, where he found th$
boats which had gone from Ahren&s;berg. The bridge
were built, the cannon planted, and the entrenchments$
the head of the bridges completed in the night between th$
&s;eventh and eighth. The Mare&s;chal having &s;ent aw$$
part of his baggage from Biele&s;eldt on the &s;ixth, went i$
per&s;on on the &s;eventh at eleven o'clock to Horn, and e$
the eighth to Braket. On advice that M. d'Armentier$
had thrown his bridges acro&s;s without oppo&s;ition, and w$
at work on his entrenchments, he went on the ninth $word$
Blankenhoven, to &s;ee the bridges and entrenchments; ar
afterwards advanced to examine the fir&s;t po&s;ition he inten$$ed
for this army, and came down the right &s;ide of t$$
We&s;er to the abbey of Corvey, where he forded the rive$
with the princes of the blood, and their attendants. $word$
the tenth in the morning he got on hor&s;eback by for
o'clock, to &s;ee the Duke of Orlean's divi&s;ion $ile off, whi$
arrived at Corvey at ten o'clock; as al&s;o that of M$
d'Armentieres, which arrived at eleven, and that of M$
Souvr&eacute;, which arrived at noon. The Mare&s;chal havi$$
examined the cour&s;e of the river, cau&s;ed the bridges,
pontoons to be laid within gun-&s;hot of the abbey, whe$
the Vi&s;count de Turenne pa&s;&s;ed that river in the ye$
one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-three, and whe$
the divi&s;ions, under Broglio and Chevert now pa&s;&s;ed it o$
the twelfth and thirteenth. The&s;e two generals being in
formed of what was to be done upon the Upper We&s;er
attacked Minden, and carried it, whil&s;t a detachment o$
the French entered the country of Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land, unde

the command of the Marquis d'Auvel: and, after taking
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lier, marched on the right of the Ems to
Embden, the only &s;ea-port the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had,
which at fir&s;t &s;eemed determined to make a defence, but
the inhabitants were not agreed upon the methods to be
taken for that purpo&s;e. They, therefore, met to delibe|rate,
but in the mean time, their gates being &s;hut, M.
d'Auvel cau&s;ed &s;ome cannon to be brought to beat them
down; and the garri&s;on, compo&s;ed of four hundred
Pru&s;&s;ians, not being &s;trong enough to defend the town,
the &s;oldiers mutinied again&s;t their officers, whereupon a
capitulation was agreed on, and the gates were opened
to the French commander, who made his troops enter
with a great deal of order, a&s;&s;ured the magi&s;trates that
care &s;hould be taken to make them ob&s;erve a good di&s;ci|pline,
and publi&s;hed two ordinances, one for the &s;ecurity
of the religion and commerce of the city, and the other
for prohibiting the exportation of corn and forage out of
that principality. The inhabitants were, however, obliged
to take an oath of allegiance to the French King.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. On Sunday the twenty-fourth of July, the
French, after having laid a part of the electorate of Han|over
under contribution, marched in three columns, with
their artillery, towards the village of Latford, when
Major-General Fu&s;tenberg, who commanded the outports
in the village, &s;ent an officer to inform the Duke of
Cumberland of their approach. His Royal Highne&s;s im|mediately
re-enforced tho&s;e po&s;ts with a body of troops,
under the command of Lieutenant-General Sporcken;
but finding it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport the village, as it was
commanded by the heights oppo&s;ite to it, which were
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the enemy, and being &s;en&s;ible that it would be
always in his power to retake it, from its &s;ituation in a
bottom between two hills, he withdrew his po&s;t from Lat|ford.
The French then made two attacks, one at the point
of the wood, and the other higher up in the &s;ame wood,
oppo&s;ite to the grenadiers commanded by Major-General
Hardenberg, but they failed in both; and though the &s;ire
of their artillery was very hot, they were obliged to re|tire.
<PB N="146" REF="148">
The French army encamping on the heights oppo|&s;ite
to the Duke of Cumberland's po&s;ts, the intelligence
received, that M. d'Etr&eacute;es had a&s;&s;embled all his troops, and
was furni&s;hed with a very con&s;iderable train of artillery,
le&s;t his Royal Highne&s;s no room to doubt of his intend|ing
to attack him. He, therefore, re&s;olved to change
his camp for a more advantageous &s;ituation, by drawing
up his army on the eminence between the We&s;er and the
woods, leaving the Hamelen river on his right, the village
of Ha&s;tenbeck in his front, and his left clo&s;e to the wood,
at the point of which his Royal Highne&s;s had a battery of
twelve pounders and haubitzers. There was a hollow
way from the left of the villages to the battery, and a mo|ra&s;s
on the other &s;ide of Ha&s;tenbeck to his right Major-General
Schulenberg, with the hunters, and two battalions
of grenadiers, was po&s;ted in the corner of the wood upon
the left of the battery; his Royal Highne&s;s ordered the
village of Ha&s;tenbeck to be cleared to his front, to pre|vent
its being in the power of the enemy to keep po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of it, and the ways by which the allies had a com|munication
with that village during their encampment
to be rendered impa&s;&s;able. In the evening he withdrew
all his out-po&s;ts, and in this po&s;ition the army lay upon
their arms all night. On the twenty-fifth in the morn|ing
the French army marched forwards in columns, and
began to cannonade the allies very &s;everely, marching
and counter-marching continually, and &s;eeming to intend
three attacks, on the right, the left, and the centre.
In the evening their artillery appeared much &s;uperior
to that of the allies. The army was again ordered to
lie all night on their arms; his Royal Highne&s;s cau&s;ed
a battery at the end of the wood to be repaired, Count
Schulenberg to be re-enforced with a battalion of gre|nadiers,
and two $ield pieces of cannon, and that
battery to be al&s;o &s;upported by four more battalions
of grenadiers, under the command of Major-General
Hardenberg. He likewi&s;e cau&s;ed a battery to be erected
of twelve and &s;ix pounders, behind the village of Ha&s;ten|beck,
and took all the precautions he could think of
<PB N="147" REF="149">
to give the enemy a warm reception. As &s;oon as it was
day-light he mounted on hor&s;e-back to reconnoitre the
po&s;ition of the enemy, whom he found in the &s;ame &s;itua|tion
as the day before. At a little after five a very &s;mart
cannonading began again&s;t the battery behind the village,
which was &s;upported by the He&s;&s;ian infantry and cavalry,
who &s;tood a mo&s;t &s;evere fire with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;teadine&s;s and
re&s;olution. Between &s;even and eight the firing of &s;mall
arms began on the left of the allies, when his Royal High|ne&s;s
ordered Major-General Behr, with three battalions
of Brun&s;wick, to &s;u&s;tain the grenadiers in the wood, if
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be wanted. The cannonading con|tinued
about &s;ix hours, during which the troops that were
expo&s;ed to it never once abated of their firmne&s;s. The
fire of the &s;mall arms on the left increa&s;ing, and the
French &s;eeming to gain ground, his Royal Highne&s;s de|tached
the Colonels Darkenhau&s;en and Bredenbach, with
three Hanoverian battalions and &s;ix &s;quadrons, round the
wood by Afferde, who, towards the clo&s;e of the day, drove
&s;everal &s;quadrons of the enemy back to their army, with|out
giving them any opportunity to charge. At length
the grenadiers in the wood, apprehen&s;ive of being &s;ur|rounded,
from the great numbers of the enemy that ap|peared
there, and were marching round on that &s;ide,
though they repul&s;ed every thing that appeared in their
front, thought it advi&s;eable to retire nearer the le$t of the
army, a motion which gave the enemy an opportunity of
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of that battery without oppo&s;ition.
Here the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf at the head of a battalion of Wol&s;enbuttel guards,
and another of Hanoverians, who attacked and repul&s;ed,
with their bayonets, a &s;uperior force of the enemy, and
retook the battery. But the French being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
an eminence which commanded and $$anked both the
lines of the infantry and the battery of the allies, and
where they were able to &s;upport their attack under the
cover of a hill, his Royal Highne&s;s, con&s;idering the &s;upe|rior
numbers of the enemy, near double to his, and the
<PB N="148" REF="150">
impo&s;&s;ibility of di&s;lodging them from their po&s;t, without
expo&s;ing his own troops too much, ordered a retreat; in
con&s;equence of which his army retired, fir&s;t to Hamelen,
where he le&s;t a garri&s;on, then to Nienburg, and after|wards
to Hoya; in the neighbourhood of which town,
after &s;ending away all the magazines, &s;ick, and wounded,
he encamped, in order to cover Bremen and Verden, and
to pre&s;erve a communication with Stade, to which place
the archives, and mo&s;t valuable effects of Hanover had
been removed. In this engagement, Colonel Breden|bach
attacked four brigades very &s;trongly po&s;ted, with a
battery of fourteen pieces of cannon, repul&s;ed, and drove
them down a precipice, and took all their artillery and
ammunition; but preferring the care of his wounded to
the glory of carrying away the cannon, he brought off
only &s;ix, nailing up and de&s;troying the re&s;t. The lo&s;s of
the allies, in all the&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes, which la&s;ted three days,
was three hundred and twenty-&s;even men killed, nine
hundred and &s;even wounded, and two hundred and
twenty mi&s;&s;ing, or taken pri&s;oners; whil&s;t that of the
French, according to their own accounts, amounted to
fifteen hundred men.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. The French, being le&s;t ma&s;ters of the field,
&s;oon reduced Hamelen, which was far from being well
fortified, obliged the garri&s;on to capitulate, and took out
of the town &s;ixty bra&s;s cannon, &s;everal mortars, forty
ovens, part of the equipage of the Duke's army, and
large quantities of provi&s;ions and ammunition, which
they $ound in it, together with a great many &s;ick and
wounded, who, not being included in the capitulation,
were made pri&s;oners of war. Whether the court of France
had any rea&s;on to find fault with the conduct of the Mare&s;|chal
d'Etr&eacute;es, or whether its monarch was blindly guided
by the councils of his favourite, the Marqui&s;e de Pompa|dour,
who, de&s;irous to te&s;tify her gratitude to the man
who had been one of the chief in&s;truments of her high
promotion, was glad of an opportunity to retrieve his
&s;hattered fortunes, and, at the &s;ame time, to add to her
<PB N="149" REF="151">
own already immen&s;e trea&s;ure, we &s;hall not pretend to
determine; though the event &s;eems plainly to &s;peak the
la&s;t. Even at the time no compari&s;on was made between
the military &s;kill of the Mare&s;chal d'Etr&eacute;es, and that of
the Duke de Richelieu; but, however that may have
been, this la&s;t, who, if he had not &s;hone in the character
of a &s;oldier, excelled all, or at lea&s;t mo&s;t of his cotempo|raries
in the more refined arts of a courtier, was, ju&s;t be|fore
the battle we have been &s;peaking of, appointed to
&s;uper&s;ede the former in the command of the French army
in Lower Saxony, where he arrived on the &s;ixth of Au|gu&s;t,
with the title of mare&s;chal of France; and M.
d'Etrees immediately re&s;igned the command.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVI. Immediately after the battle of Ha&s;tenbeck,
the French &s;ent a detachment of four thou&s;and men to lay
under contribution the countries of Hanover and Brun&s;|wick-Wolfenbuttel,
as well as the duchies of Bremen
and Verden; and two days after the arrival of this new
commander, the Duke de Chevreu&s;e was detached with
two thou&s;and men to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Hanover it&s;elf,
with the title of governor of that city. He accordingly
marched thither; and upon his arrival the Hanoverian
garri&s;on was di&s;armed, and left at liberty to retire where
they plea&s;ed. About the &s;ame time M. de Contades,
with a detachment from the French army, was &s;ent to
make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the territories of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el,
where he found no oppo&s;ition. He was met at Warberg
by that prince's ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, who declared, that
they were ready to furni&s;h the French army with all the
&s;uccours the country could afford; and accordingly the
magi&s;trates of Ca&s;&s;el pre&s;ented him with the keys as &s;oon
as he entered their city. Gottingen was ordered by M.
d'Armentieres to prepare for him within a limited time,
upon pain of military execution, four thou&s;and pounds of
white bread, two thou&s;and bu&s;hels of oats, a greater
quantity than could be found in the whole country, an
hundred loads of hay, and other provi&s;ions.</P>

&sect; XLVII. The Duke of Cumberland remained en|camped
in the neighbourhood of Hoya till the twenty-fourth
of Augu&s;t, when, upon advice that the enemy had
laid two bridges over the Aller in the night, and had
pa&s;&s;ed that river with a large body of troops, he ordered his
army to march, to &s;ecure the important po&s;t and pa&s;&s;age of
Rotenburg, le&s;t they &s;hould attempt to march round on
his left. He encamped that night at Hau&s;en, having de|tached
Lieutenant-General Oberg, with eight battalions
and &s;ix &s;quadrons, to Otter&s;berg, to which place he
marched next day, and encamped behind the Wummer,
in a very &s;trong &s;ituation, between Otter&s;berg and Roten|burg.
the French took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Verden on the
twenty-&s;ixty of Augu&s;t, and one of their detachments
went on the twenty-ninth to Bremen, where the gates
were immediately opened to them. The Duke of Cum|berland,
now clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, and in danger of
having his communication with Stade cut off, which
the enemy was endeavouring to effect, by &s;ie&s;ing upon all
the po&s;ts round him, found it nece&s;&s;ary to decamp again;
to abandon Rotenburg, of which the French immediately
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; to retreat to Sel&s;ingen, where his head-quarters
were, on the fir&s;t of September; and from thence,
on the third of the &s;ame month, to retire under the cannon
of Stade. Here it was imagined that his army would
have been able to maintain their ground between the Aller
and the Elbe, till the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on &s;hould put an
end to the campaign. Accordingly his Royal Highne&s;s,
upon his taking this po&s;ition, &s;ent a detachment of his
forces to Buck-Schantz, with &s;ome artillery, and orders
to de$end that place to the utmo&s;t: but as it could not
po&s;&s;ibly have held out many days, and as the French
who now hemmed him in on all &s;ides, by making them|&s;elves
ma&s;ters of a little fort at the mouth of the river
Zwinga, would have cut off his communication with the
Elbe, &s;o that four Engli&s;hmen of war then in that river
could have been of no &s;ervice to him, he was forced to
accept of a mediation offered by the King of Denmark,
<PB N="151" REF="153">
by his mini&s;ter the Count de Lynar, and to &s;ign the famous
convention of Clo&s;ter-Seven<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>This remarkable capitulation, which we &s;hall give here at full length, on account of the di&s;putes that aro&s;e &s;hortly after concerning what the French called an infraction of it, was to the following effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>&startq;HIS Maje&s;ty the King of Denmark, touched with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the countries of Bremen and Verden, to which he has always granted his &s;pecial protection; and being de&s;irous, by preventing tho&s;e countries from being any longer the theatre of war, to &s;pare al&s;o the effu&s;ion of blood in the armies which are ready to di&s;pute the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, hath employed his media|tion by the mini&s;try of the Count de Lynar. His Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of Cumberland, general of the army of the allies, on the one part, and his Ex|cellency the Mare&s;chal Duke de Richelieu, general of the King of France's forces in Germany, on the other, have, in con&s;ideration of the intervention of his Dani&s;h Maje&s;ty, re&s;pectively engaged their word of honour to the Count de Lynar, to abide by the convention hereafter &s;tipulated; and he, the Count de Lynar, corre&s;pondently to the magnanimity of the King his ma&s;ter's intention, obliges him&s;elf to procure the guarantee mentioned in the pre&s;ent convention; &s;o that it &s;hall be &s;ent to him, with his full powers, which there was no time to make out, in the circum&s;tances which hurried his departure.</P>
<P>Article I. Ho&s;tilities &s;hall cea&s;e on both &s;ides within twenty-four hours, or &s;ooner, if po&s;&s;ible. Orders for this purpo&s;e &s;hall be immediately &s;ent to the detached corps.</P>

<P>III. His Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of Cumberland obliges him&s;elf to pa&s;s the Elbe, with &s;uch part of his army as he &s;hall not be able to place in the city of Stade: That the part of his forces which &s;hall enter into garri&s;on in the &s;aid city, and which it is &s;uppo&s;ed may amount to between four and &s;ix thou|&s;and men, &s;hall remain there under the guarantee of his Maje&s;ty the King of Denmark, without committing any act of ho&s;tility: nor, on the other hand, &s;hall they be expo&s;ed to any from the French troops.

round that place, for the conveniency of the garri&s;on; which limits &s;hall not extend beyond half a league or a league from the place, according to the nature of the ground or circum&s;tances, which &s;hall be fairly &s;ettled by the commi&s;&s;aries. The re&s;t of the Hanoverian army &s;hall go and take quarters in the country beyond the Elbe; and, to facilitate the march of tho&s;e troops, his Excellency the Duke de Richelieu &s;hall concert with a general officer &s;ent from the Hanoverian army the route they &s;hall take; obliging him&s;elf to give the nece&s;&s;ary pa&s;&s;ports and &s;ecurity for the free pa&s;&s;age of them and their baggage to the places of their de&s;tination; his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of Cumberland re&s;erving to him&s;elf the liberty of negociating between the two courts, for an exten&s;ion of tho&s;e quarters. As to the French troops, they &s;hall remain in the re&s;t of the duchies of Bremen and Verden, till the definitive reconciliation of the two &s;overeigns.</P>

As the afore&s;aid articles are to be executed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, the Hanoverian army, and the corps which are detached from it, particularly that which is at Buck-Schantz, and the neighbourhood, &s;hall retire under Stade in the &s;pace of eight-and-forty hours. The French army &s;hall not pa&s;s the river O&s;te, in the duchy of Bremen, till the limits be regulated. It &s;hall, be&s;ides, keep all the po&s;ts and countries of which it is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and, not to retard the regulation of the limits between the armies, commi&s;&s;aries &s;hall be nominated and &s;ent on the 10th in&s;tant to Bremenworden, by his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of Cumberland, and his Excellency the Mare&s;chal Duke de Richelieu, to regulate, as well the limits to be a&s;&s;igned to the French army, as tho&s;e that are to be ob&s;erved by the garri&s;on at Stade, according to Art.

<Q>SEPARATE ARTICLES.</Q>
<P>UPON the repre&s;entation made by the Count de Lynar, with a view to explain &s;ome di&s;po&s;itions made by the pre&s;ent convention, the following ar|ticles have been added:</P>
<P>I. It is the intention of his Excellency the Mare&s;chal Duke de Richelieu, that the allied troops of his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of Cumberland &s;hall be &s;ent back to their re&s;pective countries, according to the form mentioned in the &s;econd article; and that as to their &s;eparation and di&s;tribution in the country, it &s;hall be regulated between the courts, tho&s;e troops not being con&s;idered as pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>II. It having been repre&s;ented that the country of Lunenberg cannot accom|modate more than fifteen battalions and &s;ix &s;quadrons, and that the city of Stade cannot ab&s;olutely contain the garri&s;on of &s;ix thou&s;and men allotted to it, his Excellency the Mare&s;chal Duke de Richelieu, being pre&s;&s;ed by M. de Lynar, who &s;upported this repre&s;entation by the guarantee of his Dani&s;h Maje&s;ty, gives his con&s;ent, and his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of Cumber|land engages to cau&s;e fifteen battalions and &s;ix &s;quadrons to pa&s;s the Elbe; and the whole body of hunters, and the remaining ten battalions and twen|ty-eight &s;quadrons &s;hall be placed in the town of Stade, and the places
<PB N="153" REF="155">
neare&s;t to it that are within the line, which &s;hall be marked by po&s;ts from the mouth of the Liche in the Elbe, to the mouth of the Elmerbeck in the river O&s;te; provided always that the &s;aid ten battalions and twenty-eight &s;quadrons &s;hall be quartered there as they are at the time of &s;igning this con|vention, and &s;hall not be recruited under any pretext, or augmented in any ca&s;e; and this clau&s;e is particularly guaranteed by the Count de Lynar in the name of his Dani&s;h Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>III. Upon the repre&s;entation of his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of Cumber|land, that the army and the detached corps cannot both retire under Stade in eight-and-forty hours, agreeable to the convention, his Excellency the Mare&s;chal Duke de Richlieu hath &s;ignified, that he will grant them proper time, provided the corps encamped at Buck-Schantz, as well as the army encamped at Bremen-worden, begin their march to retire in four-and-twenty hours after &s;igning the convention. The time nece&s;&s;ary for other arrangements, and the execution of the articles concerning the re&s;pective limits, &s;hall be &s;ettled between Lieutenant-General Sporcken, and the Mar|quis de Villemar, fir&s;t lieutenant general of the King's army.</P>

thou&s;and Hanoverians laid down their arms, and were di&s;|per&s;ed

and the whole force of the French let loo&s;e
$gain&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia by this treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1757.</NOTE> Mare&s;chal
$ichelieu immediately ordered Lieutenant-General Ber|$ini
to march with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, with the troops
$nder his command to join the Prince de Soubi&s;e: the
$ens-d'armes, and other troops that were in the landgra|$ate
of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, received the &s;ame order; and &s;ixty
$$ttalions of foot, and the greate&s;t part of the hor&s;e be|$nging
to the French army, were directed to attack the
$u&s;&s;ian territories. Mare&s;chal Richelieu him&s;elf arrived
Brun&s;wick on the fifteenth of September; and having,
a few days after, a&s;&s;embled an hundred and ten batta|lions,
<PB N="156" REF="158">
and an hundred and fifty &s;quadrons, with an hundred
pieces of cannon, near Wolfenbuttel, he entered the King
of Pru&s;&s;ia's dominions with his army on the 27th, 28th,
and 29th of the &s;ame month, in three columns, which pe|netrated
into Halber&s;tadt and Brandenburg, plundering
the towns, exacting contributions, and committing many
enormities, at which their general is &s;aid to have connived.
In the mean time, the Duke of Cumberland returned to
England, where he arrived on the 11th of October, and
&s;hortly after re&s;igned all his military commands.</P>
<P>&sect; II. Had the allied army, after the battle of Ha&s;tenbeck,
marched directly to the Leine, as it might ea&s;ily have
done, and then taken po&s;t on the other &s;ide of Wolfen|buttel,
Halber&s;tadt, and Magdeburgh, it might have
waited &s;ecurely under the cannon of the latter place for
the junction of the Pru&s;&s;ian forces; in&s;tead of which,
they injudiciou&s;ly turned off to the Lower We&s;er, retiring
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively from Hamelen to Nienburg, Verden, Rothen|burgh,
Buxtchude, and la&s;tly to Stade, where, for want
of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and elbow room, the troops were all made
pri&s;oners of war at large. They made a march of an
hundred and fifty miles to be cooped up in a nook, in&s;tead
of taking the other route, which was only about an hun|dred
miles, and would have led them to a place of &s;afety.
By this unaccountable conduct, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was
not only deprived of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of near forty thou&s;and
good troops, which, in the clo&s;e of the campaign, might
have put him upon an equality with the French and the
army of the Empire; but al&s;o expo&s;ed to, and actually
invaded by his numerous enemies on all &s;ides, in&s;omuch
that his &s;ituation became now more dangerous than ever;
and the fate which &s;eemed to have threatened the Empre&s;s
a few months before, through his means, was, to all
appearance, turned again&s;t him&s;elf. His ruin was pre|dicted,
nor could human prudence fore&s;ee how he might
be extricated from his complicated di&s;tre&s;s; for, be&s;ides
the inva&s;ion of his territories by the French under the
Duke de Richelieu, the Ru&s;&s;ians, who had made for a
<PB N="157" REF="159">
long time a dilatory march, and &s;eemed uncertain of their
own re&s;olutions, all at once quickened their motions, and
entered ducal Pru&s;&s;ia under Mare&s;chal Apraxin and Ge|neral
Fermor, marking their progre&s;s by every inhumanity
that unbridled cruelty, lu&s;t, and rapine can be imagined
capable of committing. A large body of Au&s;trians
entered Sile&s;ia, and penetrated as far as Bre&s;lau: then,
turning back, they laid &s;iege to the important fortre&s;s of
Schweidnitz, the key of that country. A &s;econd body
entered Lu&s;atia, another quarter of the Pru&s;&s;ian territories,
and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Zittau. Twenty-two
thou&s;and Swedes penetrated into Pru&s;&s;ian Pomerania, took
the towns of Anclam and Demmin, and laid the whole
country under contribution. The army of the Empire,
re-enforced by that of Prince Soubi&s;e, after many delays,
was at la&s;t in full march to enter Saxony; and this
motion left the Au&s;trians at liberty to turn the greate&s;t
$part of their forces to the reduction of Sile&s;ia. An Au&s;|trian
general, penetrating through Lu&s;atia, pa&s;&s;ed by the
Pru&s;&s;ian armies, and &s;uddenly pre&s;enting him&s;elf before
the gates of Berlin, laid the whole country under contri|bution;
and though he retired on the approach of a body
of Pru&s;&s;ians, yet he &s;till found means to interrupt the com|munication
of the&s;e la&s;t with Sile&s;ia. The Pru&s;&s;ians, it
is true, exerted them&s;elves bravely on all &s;ides, and their
enemies fled before them; but whil&s;t one body was pur&s;uing
another gained upon them in &s;ome other part. The win|ter
approached, their &s;trength decayed, and their adver|&s;aries
multiplied daily. Their king harra&s;&s;ed, and almo&s;t
&s;pent with ince&s;&s;ant fatigue both of body and of mind,
was in a manner excluded from the Empire. The greate&s;t
part of his dominions were either taken from him, or laid
under contribution, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his enemies; who
collected the publick revenues, fattened on the contri|butions,
and with the riches which they drew from the
electorate of Hanover, and other conque&s;ts, defrayed the
expences of the war; and by the convention of Clo&s;ter-Seven
he was deprived of his allies, and left without any
<PB N="158" REF="160">
a&s;&s;i&s;tance whatever, excepting what the Briti&s;h parliament
might think fit to &s;upply. How different is this picture
from that which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia exhibited when he
took arms to enter Saxony! But, in order to form a clear
idea of the&s;e events, of the &s;ituation of his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty,
and of the &s;teps he took to defeat the de&s;igns of his
antagoni&s;ts, and extricate him&s;elf from his great and nu|merous
di&s;tre&s;&s;es, it will be proper now to take a view of
the &s;everal tran&s;actions of his enemies, as well during his
&s;tay in Bohemia, as from the time of his leaving it, down
to that which we are now &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>&sect; III. Whil&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was in Bohemia, the
Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia ordered notice to be given to all ma&s;ters
of &s;hips, That if any of them were found a&s;&s;i&s;ting the
Pru&s;&s;ians, by the tran&s;portation of troops, artillery, and
ammunition, they &s;hould be condemned as legal prizes:
and her fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen men of war and frigates,
with two bomb ketches, was &s;ent to block up the Pru&s;&s;ian
ports in the Baltick, where it took &s;everal &s;hips of that
nation, which were employed in carrying provi&s;ions and
merchandi&s;e from one port to another. One of the&s;e &s;hips
of war appearing before Memel, a town of Poland, but
&s;ubject to Pru&s;&s;ia, the commandant &s;ent an officer to the
captain, to know whether he came as a friend or an ene|my;
to which interrogation the Ru&s;&s;ian captain replied,
That, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;po&s;itions of the Empre&s;s of
both the Ru&s;&s;ias were &s;ufficiently known, yet he would
further explain them, by declaring that his orders, and
tho&s;e of the other Ru&s;&s;ian commanders, were, in con|formity
to the laws of war, to &s;ei&s;e on all the Pru&s;&s;ian
ve&s;&s;els they met with on their crui&s;e. Upon which the
commandant of Memel immediately gave orders for point|ing
the cannon to fire upon all Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hips that &s;hould
approach that place.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. The land-forces of the Ru&s;&s;ians had now lingered
on their march upwards of &s;ix months; and it was pretty
generally doubted, by tho&s;e who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have
the be&s;t intelligence, whether they ever were de&s;igned
<PB N="159" REF="161">
really to pa&s;s into the Pru&s;&s;ian territories, not only on
account of their long &s;tay on the boarders of Lithuania,
but al&s;o becau&s;e &s;everal of their Co&s;&s;acks had been &s;everely
puni&s;hed for plundering the waggons of &s;ome Pru&s;&s;ian
pea&s;ants upon the frontiers of Courland, and the damage
of the pea&s;ants compen&s;ated with money, though General
Apraxin's army was at the &s;ame time greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by
the want of provi&s;ions; when, on a &s;udden, they quick|ened
their motions, and &s;howed they were, in earne&s;t,
determined to accompli&s;h the ruin of Pru&s;&s;ia. Their fir&s;t
act of ho&s;tility was the attack of Memel, which &s;urren|dered;
and by the articles of capitulation it was agreed,
that the garri&s;on &s;hould march out with all the honours
of war, after having engaged not to &s;erve again&s;t the
Empre&s;s, or any of her allies, for the &s;pace of one year.</P>
<P>&sect; V. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, ju&s;tly fore&s;eeing the great
enormities that were to be expected from the&s;e &s;avage ene|mies,
who were unaccu&s;tomed to make war, except upon
nations as barbarous as them&s;elves, who looked upon war
only as an opportunity for plunder, and every country
through which they happened to march as their's by right
of conque&s;t, publi&s;hed the following declaration:&mdash;$ It
is &s;ufficiently known, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, after the
example of his glorious predece&s;&s;ors, has, ever &s;ince his
acce&s;&s;ion to the crown, laid it down as a maxim to &s;eek
the friend&s;hip of the imperial court of Ru&s;&s;ia, and culti|vate
it by every method. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty hath had
the &s;atisfaction to live, for &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, in the
&s;tricte&s;t harmony with the reigning Empre&s;s; and this
happy union would be &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, if evil-minded po|tentates
had not broke it by their &s;ecret machinations, and
carried things to &s;uch a height, that the mini&s;ters on both
&s;ides have been recalled, and the corre&s;pondence broken
off. However melancholy the&s;e circum&s;tances might be
for the King, his Maje&s;ty was neverthele&s;s mo&s;t attentive
to prevent any thing that might increa&s;e the alienation of
the Ru&s;&s;ian court. He hath been particularly careful,
during the di&s;turbances of the war that now unhappily
<PB N="160" REF="162">
rages, to avoid whatever might involve him in a difference
with that court, notwith&s;tanding the great grievances he
hath to alledge again&s;t it; and that it was publickly known
the court of Vienna had at la&s;t drawn that of Ru&s;&s;ia into
its de&s;tructive views, and made it &s;erve as an in&s;trumen$
for favouring the &s;chemes of Au&s;tria. His Maje&s;ty hath
given the whole world inconte&s;table proofs, that he wa$
under an indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of having recour&s;e to th$
mea&s;ures he hath taken again&s;t the courts of Vienna and
Saxony, who forced him by their conduct to take up arm$
for his defence. Yet, even &s;ince things have been brought
to this extremity, the King hath offered to lay down hi$
arms, if proper &s;ecurities &s;hould be granted to him. Hi$
Maje&s;ty hath not neglected to expo&s;e the artifices by which
the imperial court of Ru&s;&s;ia hath been drawn into mea|&s;ures
&s;o oppo&s;ite to the Empre&s;s's &s;entiments, and which
would excite the utmo&s;t indignation of that great prince&s;s&punc;
if the truth could be placed before her without di&s;gui&s;e
The King&punc; did more: he &s;ugge&s;ted to her Imperial Ma|je&s;ty
&s;ufficient means either to excu&s;e her not taking an$
part in the pre&s;ent war, or to avoid, upon the ju&s;te$
grounds, the execution of tho&s;e engagements which the
court of Vienna claimed by a manife&s;t abu&s;e of obligations
which they employed to palliate their unlawful views
It wholly depended upon the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia to ex|tingui&s;h
the flames of the war, without un&s;heathing th$
&s;word, by pur&s;uing the mea&s;ures &s;ugge&s;ted by the King
This conduct would have immortali&s;ed her reign through
out all Europe. It would have gained her more la&s;tin$
glory than can be acquired by the greate&s;t triumph&punc;
The King finds with regret, that all his precautions and
care to maintain peace with the Ru&s;&s;ian empire are fruit
le&s;s, and that the intrigues of his enemies have prevailed
His Maje&s;ty &s;ees all the con&s;iderations of friend&s;hip an$
good neighbourhood &s;et a&s;ide by the Imperial court o$
Ru&s;&s;ia, as well as the ob&s;ervance of its engagements wit$
his Maje&s;ty. He &s;ees that court marching its troops throug$
the territories of a foreign power, and, contrary to the tene$
<PB N="161" REF="163">
of treaties, in order to attack the King in his dominions:
and thus taking part in a war, in which his enemies have
involved the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. In &s;uch circum&s;tances,
the King hath no other part to take, but to employ the
power which God hath entru&s;ted to him in defending
him&s;elf, protecting his &s;ubjects, and repelling every un|ju&s;t
attack. His Maje&s;ty will never lo&s;e &s;ight of the rules
which are ob&s;erved, even in the mid&s;t of war, among
civili&s;ed nations. But if, contrary to all hope and ex|pectation,
the&s;e rules &s;hould be violated by the troops of
Ru&s;&s;ia, if they commit in the King's territories di&s;orders
and exce&s;&s;es di&s;allowed by the laws of arms, his Maje&s;ty
mu&s;t not be blamed if he makes repri&s;als in Saxony:
and if, in&s;tead of that good order and rigorous di&s;cipline
which have hitherto been ob&s;erved by his army, avoiding all
&s;orts of violence, he finds him&s;elf forced, contrary to his in|clination,
to &s;uffer the provinces and &s;ubjects of Saxony to
be treated in the &s;ame manner as his own territories &s;hall be
treated. As to the re&s;t, the King will &s;oon pubi&s;h to
the whole world the futility of the rea&s;ons alledged by the
imperial court of Ru&s;&s;ia to ju&s;tify its aggre&s;&s;ion; and as
his Maje&s;ty is forced upon making his defence, he has
room to hope, with confidence, that the Lord of ho&s;ts
will ble&s;s his righteous arms, that he will di&s;appoint the
unju&s;t enterpri&s;es of his enemies, and grant him his power|ful
a&s;&s;i&s;tance to enable him to make head again&s;t them.&endq;</P>
<P>&sect; VI. When the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was put under the ban
of the empire, the &s;everal princes who compo&s;e that body
were required, by the decree of the Aulick council, as
we ob&s;erved before, to furni&s;h their re&s;pective contingents
again&s;t him. Tho&s;e who feared him looked upon this as a
fair opportunity of reducing him; and tho&s;e who &s;tood in awe
of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria were, through nece&s;&s;ity, compelled
to &s;upport that power which they dreaded. Be&s;ides, they
were accu&s;tomed to the influence of a family, in which the
empire had, for a long time, been in a manner hereditary;
and were al&s;o intimidated by the appearance of a confede|racy,
the mo&s;t formidable, perhaps, that the world had
<PB N="162" REF="164">
ever &s;een. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, the contingents,
both of men and money, were collected &s;lowly; the troops
were badly compo&s;ed; and many of tho&s;e, not only of
the prote&s;tant princes, but al&s;o of the catholicks, &s;howed
the utmo&s;t reluctance to act again&s;t his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty,
which, indeed, none of them would have been able to do,
had it not been for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French under the
Prince de Soubi&s;e. The Elector-Palatine lo&s;t above a
thou&s;and men by de&s;ertion. Four thou&s;and of the troops
belonging to the Duke of Wirtemberg being delivered to
the French commi&s;&s;ary on the twenty-fourth of June,
were immediately reviewed; but the review was &s;carcely
fini&s;hed, when they began to cry aloud, that they were
&s;old. Next morning thirty of them de&s;erted at once, and
were &s;oon followed by parties of twenty and thirty each,
who forced their way through the detachments that guard|ed
the gates of Stutgard, and in the evening the mutiny
became general. They fired upon the officers in their
barracks, and let their general know, that if he did not
immediately withdraw, they would put him to death.
Mean while, &s;ome of the officers having pur&s;ued the de|&s;erters,
brought back a part of them pri&s;oners, when the
re&s;t of the &s;oldiers declared, that if they were not im|mediately
relea&s;ed, they would &s;et fire to the &s;tadthou&s;e
and barracks; upon which the pri&s;oners were &s;et at liberty
late in the evening. Next morning the &s;oldiers a&s;&s;embled,
and having &s;ei&s;ed &s;ome of the officers, three or four
hundred of them marched out of the town at a time; with
the mu&s;ick of the regiments playing before them; and in
this manner near three thou&s;and of them filed off, and the
remainder were afterwards di&s;charged.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, upon his leaving Bohemia
after the battle of Kolin, retired towards Saxony, as we
ob&s;erved before; and having &s;ent his heavy artillery and
mortars up the Elbe to Dre&s;den, &s;ixed his camp on th$
banks of that river, at Leitmeritz, where his main arm$
was &s;trongly entrenched, whil&s;t Mare&s;chal Keith, wit$
the troops under his command, encamped on the oppo&s;it$$
<PB N="163" REF="165">
&s;hore; a free communication being kept open by means of
a bridge. At the &s;ame time detachments were ordered to
&s;ecure the pa&s;&s;es into Saxony. As this po&s;ition of the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia prevented the Au&s;trians from being able
to penetrate into Saxony by the way of the Elbe, they
moved, by flow marches, into the circle of Buntzlau,
and, at la&s;t, with a detachment commanded by the Duke
d'Aremberg and M. Macguire, on the eighteenth of
June fell &s;uddenly upon, and took, the important po&s;t
at Gabel, &s;ituated between Boemi&s;h-Leypa, and Zittau,
after an ob&s;tinate defence made by the Pru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on,
under Major-General Putkammer, con&s;i&s;ting of four
battalions, who were obliged to &s;urrender pri&s;oners of
war. The Au&s;trians having by this motion gained a
march towards Lu&s;atia, upon a corps which had been de|tached
under the command of the Prince of Pru&s;&s;ia to
watch them, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty thought proper to leave
Leitmeritz on the twentieth in the morning, and lay that
night at Lickowitz, a village oppo&s;ite to Leitmeritz, of
which a battalion of his troops &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, while
the re&s;t of his army remained encamped in the plain be|fore
that place. Next morning, at break of day, Prince
Henry decamped, and made &s;o good a di&s;po&s;ition for his
retreat, that he did not lo&s;e a &s;ingle man, though he
marched in &s;ight of the whole body of Au&s;trian irregu|lars.
He pa&s;&s;ed the bridge at Leitmeritz, after with|drawing
the battalion that was in the town, and having
burnt the bridge, the whole army united, and made a
&s;mall movement towards the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains; the
King then lying at Sulowitz, near the field where the
battle of Lowo&s;chutz was fought on the fir&s;t of Octo|ber
of the preceding year. The heavy baggage was &s;ent
on in the afternoon, with a proper e&s;corte; and in the
morning of the twenty-&s;econd the army marched in
two columns, and encamped on the high grounds at Lu|&s;echitz,
a little beyond Lenai, where it halted the twenty-third.
No attack was made upon the rear-guard, though
great numbers of Au&s;trian hu&s;&s;ars, and other irregulars,
<PB N="164" REF="166">
had appeared the evening before within cannon-&s;hot of the
Pru&s;&s;ian camp. On the twenty-fourth the army marched
to Nellendorf; on the twenty-fifth it encamped near
Cotta; on the twenty-&s;ixth near Pirna, where it halted
the next day; and on the twenty-eighth it cro&s;&s;ed the
river near that place, and entered Lu&s;atia, where, by the
end of the month, it encamped at Bautzen.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The King's army made this retreat with all the
&s;ucce&s;s that could be wi&s;hed; but the corps under the
Prince of Pru&s;&s;ia had not the &s;ame good fortune: for
the Au&s;trians, immediately after their taking Gabel, &s;ent a
&s;trong detachment again&s;t Zittau, a trading town in the
circle of Upper-Saxony, where the Pru&s;&s;ians had large ma|gazines,
and a garri&s;on of &s;ix battalions, and, in his &s;ight,
attacked it with uncommon rage. Paying no regard to
the inhabitants as being friends or allies, but determined
to reduce the place before the King of Pru&s;&s;ia could have
time to march to its relief, they no &s;ooner arrived before it,
than they bombarded and cannonaded it with &s;uch fury,
that mo&s;t of the garri&s;on, finding them&s;elves unable to re|&s;i&s;t,
made their e&s;cape, and carried off as much as they could
of the magazines, leaving only three or four hundred men
in the town, under Colonel Diricke, to hold it out as long
as po&s;&s;ible; which he accordingly did, till the whole place
was almo&s;t de&s;troyed. The cannonading began on the
twenty-third of July, at eleven in the morning, and la&s;ted
till five in the evening. In this &s;pace of time four thou&s;and
balls, many of them red-hot, were fired into this unfortunate
city, with &s;o little intermi&s;&s;ion, that it was &s;oon &s;et on fire
in &s;everal places. In the confu&s;ion which the con&s;tagration
produced, the Au&s;trians entered the town, and the inhabi|tants
imagined that they had then nothing further to fear;
and that their friends, the Au&s;trians, would a&s;&s;i&s;t them in
extingui&s;hing the flames, and &s;aving the place: but in
this particular their expectations were di&s;appointed. The
Pandours and Sclavonians, who ru&s;hed in with the regular
troops, made no di&s;tinction between the Pru&s;&s;ians and
the inhabitants of Zittau: in&s;tead of helping to quench
<PB N="165" REF="167">
the flames, they began to plunder the warehou&s;es which
the fire had not reached; &s;o that all the valuable merchan|di&s;e
they contained was either carried off or reduced to
a&s;hes. Upwards of &s;ix hundred hou&s;es, and almo&s;t all
the publick buildings, the cathedrals of St. John and St.
James, the orphan-hou&s;e, eight par&s;onage-hou&s;es, eight
&s;chools, the town-hou&s;e, and every thing contained in
it, the publick weigh-hou&s;e, the pri&s;on, the archives,
and all the other documents of the town-council, the
plate, and other things of value, pre&s;ented to the town
from time to time by emperors, kings, and other
princes and noblemen, were entirely de&s;troyed, and more
than four hundred citizens were killed in this a&s;&s;ault.
Of the whole town there was left &s;tanding only one
hundred and thirty-eight hou&s;es, two churches, the coun|cil,
library, and the &s;alt-work. The Queen of Poland
was &s;o affected by this melancholy account, that &s;he is
&s;aid to have fainted away upon hearing it. As this city
belonged to their friend the King of Poland, the Au&s;trians
thought proper to publi&s;h an excu&s;e for their conduct,
a&s;cribing it entirely to the nece&s;&s;ity they were under, and
the ob&s;tinate defence made by the Pru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on. But
what excu&s;es can atone for &s;uch barbarity?</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The corps under the Prince of Pru&s;&s;ia, which
had been witne&s;&s;es to the de&s;truction of this unhappy place,
was, by the King's march to Bautzen, fortunately extri|cated
from the danger of being &s;urrounded by the Au&s;tri|ans,
who, upon his Maje&s;ty's approach, retired from
their po&s;ts on the right. Soon after this event the Prince
of Pru&s;&s;ia, finding his health much impaired by the fatigues
of the campaign<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This was the rea&s;on that was publickly a&s;&s;igned for his quitting the army: but a much more probable one, which was only whi&s;pered, &s;eems to have been, that this prince, than whom none ever was more remarkable for hu|manity and the &s;ocial virtues, di&s;liking the violent proceedings of the king his brother, could not refrain from expo&s;tulating with him on that &s;ubject: upon which his Maje&s;ty, with an air of great di&s;approbation, told him, &startq;That the air of Berlin would be better for him than that of the camp.&endq; The Prince accordingly retired to Berlin, where he died &s;oon after; grief and concern for the welfare of his brother, and for the &s;teps taken by him, having no &s;mall &s;hare in his death.</NOTE>, quitted the army, and returned to
<PB N="166" REF="168">
Berlin. In the mean time, Mare&s;chal Keith, who had
been left upon the frontier, to guard the pa&s;&s;es of the
mountains of Bohemia, arrived at Pirna, having been
much harra&s;&s;ed in his march by the enemy's irregular
troops, and lo&s;t &s;ome waggons of provi&s;ions and baggage.
After re&s;ting a day at Pirna, he pur&s;ued his march through
Dre&s;den with twenty battalions and forty &s;quadrons, and
encamped on the right of the Elbe, before the gate of the
new city, from whence he joined the King between
Bautzen and Gorlitz. The Pru&s;&s;ian army now rea&s;&s;embled
at this place amounted to about &s;ixty thou&s;and men,
be&s;ides twelve battalions and ten &s;quadrons which remained
in the famous camp at Pirna, under the Prince of Anhalt-De&s;&s;au,
to cover Dre&s;den, &s;ecure the gorges of the moun|tains,
and check the incur&s;ions of the Au&s;trian irregulars,
with whom, as they were continually flying about the
&s;kirts of the Pru&s;&s;ian army, as well in their encampments
as on their marches, almo&s;t daily &s;kirmi&s;hes happened,
with various &s;ucce&s;s. Though &s;ome of the&s;e encounters
were very bloody, they co&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ians much fewer
men than they lo&s;t by de&s;ertion &s;ince the battle of Kolin.
The rea&s;on &s;eems obvious:&mdash;The Pru&s;&s;ian army had been
recruited, in times of peace, from all parts of Germany;
and though this way of recruiting may be very proper in
&s;uch times, yet it cannot be expected to an&s;wer in a &s;tate
of actual war, e&s;pecially an unfortunate war: becau&s;e
the $idelity of &s;uch foldiers can never be &s;o much depended
on as that of natives, who &s;erve their natural &s;overeign
from principle, and not merely for pay, and who mu&s;t
de&s;ert their country, their parents, and their friends, at
the &s;ame time that they de&s;ert their prince.</P>
<P>&sect; X. It will be proper here to take notice of &s;ome events,
which could not ea&s;ily be mentioned before without
breaking through the order we have propo&s;ed to our&s;elves
in the writing of this hi&s;tory.&mdash;The Empre&s;s-Queen,
more embittered than ever again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and
his allies, recalled her mini&s;ters, Count Coloredo and
Mon&s;. Zohern, from London, towards the beginning of
<PB N="167" REF="169">
July; and about the &s;ame time Count Kaunitz, great
chancellor of the empire, informed Mr. Keith, the
Briti&s;h mini&s;ter at Vienna, that the court of London, by
the &s;uccours it had given, and &s;till continued to give, the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia, as well as by other circum&s;tances relating
to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs, having broken the &s;olemn
engagements which united this crown with the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria, her Maje&s;ty the Empre&s;s-Queen had thought
proper to recall her mini&s;ter from England, and con&s;e|quently
to break off all corre&s;pondence. Mr. Keith, in
pur&s;uance of this notice, &s;et out from Vienna on the
twenty-ninth of July; as did al&s;o Mr. De&s;rolles, his Bri|tannick
Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ter at the court of Bru&s;&s;els, from
this la&s;t place, about the &s;ame time. On the &s;eventh of
July, General Pi&s;a, commandant of O&s;tend, Nieuport,
and the maritime ports of Flanders, &s;ent his adjutant to the
Engli&s;h vice-con&s;ul at O&s;tend, at &s;ix o'clock in the morn|ing,
to tell him, that by orders from his court all communi|cation
with England was broke off; and de&s;ired the vice|con&s;ul
to intimate to the pacquet-boats and Briti&s;h &s;hipping
at O&s;tend, Bruges, and Ni$$port, to depart in twenty-four
hours, and not to return into any of the ports of the
Empre&s;s-Queen till further di&s;po&s;itions &s;hould be made.
The rea&s;ons alledged by the court of Vienna for debar|ring
the &s;ubjects of his Britannick Maje&s;ty from the u&s;e
of the&s;e ports, obtained for the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria by the
arms and trea&s;ures of Great Britain, were, &startq;That her
Imperial Maje&s;ty, the Empre&s;s-Queen, could not, with
indifference, &s;ee England, in&s;tead of giving the &s;uccours
due to her by the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties, enter into an
alliance with her enemy the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and actually
afford him all manner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, a&s;&s;embling armies to
oppo&s;e tho&s;e which the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, her ally,
had &s;ent to her aid, and &s;uffering privateers to exerci&s;e
open violence in her roads, under the cannon of her ports
and coa&s;ts, without giving the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction or an&s;wer
to the complaints made on that account; and the King of
Great-Britain him&s;elf, at the very time &s;he was offering
<PB N="168" REF="170">
him a neutrality for Hanover, publi&s;hing by a me&s;&s;age to
his parliament, that &s;he had formed, with the Mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian King, dangerous de&s;igns again&s;t that electorate:
therefore, her Maje&s;ty, de&s;irous of providing for the
&s;ecurity of her ports, judged it expedient to give the
forementioned orders; and at the &s;ame time to declare,
that &s;he could no longer permit a free communication
between her &s;ubjects and the Engli&s;h, which had hitherto
been founded upon treaties that Great-Britain had, with|out
&s;cruple, openly violated.&endq;&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e
orders, the Engli&s;h pacquet-boats, with letters, were
allowed to pa&s;s as u&s;ual to and from O&s;tend; the mini&s;ters
of her Imperial Maje&s;ty wi&s;ely con&s;idering how good a
revenue the po&s;tage of Engli&s;h letters brings in to the po&s;t-office
of the Au&s;trian Netherlands. O&s;tend and Nieu|port,
by order of her Imperial Maje&s;ty, received each of
them a French garri&s;on; the former on the nineteenth of
July, and the latter the next day, under the command of
M. de la Motte, upon who&s;e arrival the Au&s;trian troops
evacuated tho&s;e places; though the Empre&s;s-Queen &s;till
re&s;erved to her&s;elf, in both of them, the full and free
exerci&s;e of all her rights of &s;overeignty; to which purpo&s;e
an oath was admini&s;tered to the French commandant by
her Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ter-plenipotentiary for the government
of the Low Countries. At the &s;ame time, their Imperial
and Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ties notified to the magi&s;tracy of
Hamburgh, that they mu&s;t not admit any Engli&s;h men of
war, or tran&s;ports, into their port, on pain of having a
French garri&s;on impo&s;ed on them. The city of Guel|dres,
which had been blocked up by the French ever &s;ince
the beginning of &s;ummer, was forced by famine to capitu|late
on the twenty-fourth of Augu&s;t, and the garri&s;on
marched out with all the honours of war, in order to be
conducted to Berlin; but &s;o many of them de&s;erted, that
when they pa&s;&s;ed by Cologn, the whole garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted
only of the commandant, and forty-&s;even men. By the
&s;urrender of this place the whole country lay open to the
French and their allies quite up to Magdebourg; and the
<PB N="169" REF="171">
Empre&s;s-Queen immediately received two hundred thou|&s;and
crowns from the revenues of Cleves and la Marcke
alone.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. To return to the affairs more immediately re|lating
to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. The advanced po&s;ts of
the Prince of Anhalt-De&s;&s;au at Pirna were attacked on
the tenth of Augu&s;t by a body of hu&s;&s;ars, and other irregu|lar
troops of the Au&s;trians; but the Pru&s;&s;ians &s;oon obliged
them to retire, with the lo&s;s of &s;everal men and two pieces
of cannon. On the nineteenth of the &s;ame month, early
in the morning, a great number of Au&s;trian Pandours
&s;urrounded a little town called Gotliebe, in which a
Pru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on was quartered, with a de&s;ign to take it
by &s;urpri&s;e. The Pandours attacked it on all &s;ides, and
in the beginning killed twenty-three Pru&s;&s;ians, and
wounded many; but the Pru&s;&s;ians having rallied, re|pul&s;ed
the a&s;&s;ailants with great lo&s;s. The&s;e, however,
were but a &s;ort of preludes to much more deci&s;ive actions
which happened &s;oon after. Sile&s;ia, which had hitherto
been undi&s;turbed this year, began now to feel the effects
of war. Baron Jahnus, an Au&s;trian colonel, entering
that country with only an handful of men, made him&s;elf
ma&s;ter of Hir&s;chberg, Waldenberg, Gotte&s;burg, Fran|ken&s;tein,
and Land&s;hut. They were, indeed, but open
places, and he was repul&s;ed in an attempt upon Strigau.
On the &s;ide of Franconia the army of the empire was
a&s;&s;embling with all &s;peed, under the Prince of Saxe-Hild|burghau&s;en;
the French were marching a &s;econd army
from their interior provinces into Alface, in order to join
the Imperiali&s;ts: the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of their troops had
already entered the empire, and were advanced as far as
Hanau. The Swedes were now preparing, with the ut|mo&s;t
expedition, to &s;end a numerous army into Pomerania;
and the Ru&s;&s;ians, who, &s;ince the taking of Memel, had
not done the King of Pru&s;&s;ia much damage, be&s;ides that
of obliging him to keep an army in Pru&s;&s;ia to oppo&s;e them,
and interrupting the trade of Koning&s;berg by their &s;qua|drons,
were again advancing with ha&s;ty &s;trides towards
<PB N="170" REF="172">
Pru&s;&s;ia, marking their &s;teps with horrid de&s;olation.
Field-Mare&s;chal Lehwald, who had been left in Pru&s;&s;ia,
with an army of thirty thou&s;and men, to guard that king|dom
during the ab&s;ence of his ma&s;ter, was encamped near
Velau, when the Ru&s;&s;ians, to the number of eighty thou|&s;and,
after taking Memel, advanced again&s;t the territoiries
of the Pru&s;&s;ian King, who&s;e &s;ituation now drew upon him
the attention of all Europe. In the night between the
&s;eventh and eighth of Augu&s;t, Colonel Malachow&s;ki, one
of Mare&s;chal Lehwald's officers, marched to reconnoitre
the po&s;ition of the enemy, when a &s;kirmi&s;h happened,
which la&s;ted near two hours, between his advanced rank$
and a Ru&s;&s;ian detachment, three times &s;tronger than the
Pru&s;&s;ians. The Ru&s;&s;ians were repul&s;ed, and fled into the
woods, after having fifty men killed, and a great number
wounded. The Pru&s;&s;ians lo&s;t but one man, and had four|teen
wounded.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. Several other little &s;kirmi&s;hes happened between
&s;traggling parties of the two armies; and the Ru&s;&s;ians
went on pillaging and laying wa&s;te every thing before
them, till at length the two armies having approached
one another in Brandenburgh-Pru&s;&s;ia, Mare&s;chal Leh|wald,
finding it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;pare detachments from &s;o
&s;mall a number as his was, compared to that of the enemy,
to cover the wretched inhabitants from the outrages com|mitted
on them by the Ru&s;&s;ian Co&s;&s;acks, and other bari$$|rians
belonging to them, judged it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
attack their main army, and accordingly, notwith&s;tanding
his great di&s;advantage in almo&s;t every re&s;pect, he re&s;olved
to hazard a battle on the thirtieth of Augu&s;t. The Ru&s;|&s;ians,
con&s;i&s;ting, as we before ob&s;erved, of eighty thou|&s;and
regulars, under the command of Mare&s;chal Aprax$$
avoiding the open field, were entrenched in a mo&s;t ad|vantageous
camp near Norkitten, in Pru&s;&s;ia. Their army
was compo&s;ed of four lines, each of which was guarded
by an entrenchment, and the whole was defended by
two hundred pieces of cannon, batteries being placed upo$
all the eminences. Mare&s;chal Lehwald's army &s;carcely
<PB N="171" REF="173">
amounted to thirty thou&s;and men. The action began at
five in the morning, and was carried on with &s;o much vi|gour,
that the Pru&s;&s;ians entirely broke the whole fir&s;t line
of the enemy, and forced all their batteries. The Prince
of Hol&s;tein-Gottorp, brother to the King of Sweden, at
the head of his regiment of dragoons, routed the Ru&s;&s;ian
cavalry, and afterwards fell upon a regiment of grena|diers,
which was cut to pieces; but when the Pru&s;&s;ians
came to the &s;econd entrenchment, Mare&s;chal Lehwald,
&s;eeing that he could not attempt to carry it without ex|po&s;ing
his army too much, took the re&s;olution to retire.
The Pru&s;&s;ians returned to their former camp at Velau,
and the Ru&s;&s;ians remained in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation.
The lo&s;s of the Pru&s;&s;ians, little exceeding two thou&s;and
killed and wounded, was immediately replaced out of the
di&s;ciplined militia. The Ru&s;&s;ians lo&s;t a much greater
number. General Lapuchin was wounded and taken
pri&s;oner, with a colonel of the Ru&s;&s;ian artillery, but the
former was &s;ent back on his parole. The Pru&s;&s;ian army
had, at fir&s;t, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of above eighty
pieces of cannon, but were afterwards obliged to abandon
them, with eleven of their own, for want of carriages.
Three Ru&s;&s;ian generals were killed; but the Pru&s;&s;ians lo&s;t
no general or officer of di&s;tinction, of which rank Count
Dohna was the only one that was wounded.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. After this engagement, Mare&s;chal Lehwald
changed the po&s;ition of his army, by drawing towards
Peter&s;wald, and the Ru&s;&s;ians, after remaining quite in|active
till the thirteenth of September, on a &s;udden, to the
great &s;urpri&s;e of every one, retreated out of Pru&s;&s;ia, with
&s;uch precipitation, that they left all their &s;ick and wounded
behind them, to the amount of fifteen or &s;ixteen thou&s;and
men, together with eighty pieces of cannon, and a con&s;i|derable
part of their military &s;tores. Mare&s;chal Apraxin
ma&s;ked his de&s;ign by advancing all his irregulars towards
$he Pru&s;&s;ian army; &s;o that Mare&s;chal Lehwald was not
$nformed of it till the third day, when he detached Prince
George of Hol&s;tein with ten thou&s;and hor&s;e to pur&s;ue
<PB N="172" REF="174">
them; but with little hopes of coming up with them, as
they made forced marches, in order to be the &s;ooner in their
own country. However, the Pru&s;&s;ians took &s;ome of them
pri&s;oners, and many &s;tragglers were killed by the country
people in their flight towards Tilfit, which they aban|doned,
though they &s;till kept Memel, and &s;hortly after
added &s;ome new fortifications to that place. They made
their retreat in two columns, one of which directed it$
cour&s;e towards Memel; whil&s;t the other took the neare&s;t
way through the bailiwick of Ab&s;ternen, and threw bridge
over the river Jura. Both columns burnt every village
they pa&s;&s;ed through without di&s;tinction. The Pru&s;&s;ian
were obliged to de&s;i&s;t from the pur&s;uit of the&s;e barbarians
becau&s;e the bridges thrown over the river Memel had bee$
de&s;troyed by the violence of the &s;tream. The Ru&s;&s;ia$
army &s;uffered greatly for want of bread, as all the countrie
were ruined through which it pa&s;&s;ed, &s;o that they coul$
procure no &s;ort of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence but herbage and rye bread
All the roads were &s;trewed with dead bodies of men an$
hor&s;es. The real cau&s;e of this &s;udden retreat is a
great a my&s;tery as the rea&s;on of their &s;topping &s;o long th$
year before on the borders of Lithuania; though the oc$ca&s;ion
of it is &s;aid to have been the illne&s;s of the Czarina
who was &s;ei&s;ed with a kind of apoplectick fit, and ha$
made &s;ome new regulation in ca&s;e of a vacancy of th$
throne, which rendered it expedient that the regula$
forces &s;hould be at hand, to &s;upport the mea&s;ures take$
by the government.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, after remaining for &s;om$ time
encamped between Bautzen and Goerlitz, remove$
his head-quarters to Bern&s;tedel; and on the fifteenth o$
Augu&s;t his army came in &s;ight of the Au&s;trian camp, an$
within cannon &s;hot of it: upon which the Au&s;trian
&s;truck their tents, and drew up in order of battle befor$
their camp. The King formed his army over again$
them, and immediately went to reconnoitre the groun$
between the armies; but, as it was then late, he deferre$
the more exact examination of that circum&s;tance till th$
<PB N="173" REF="175">
$ext day. The two armies continued under arms all
$ight. Next morning, at break of day, the King found
$e Au&s;trians encamped with their right at the river
Vei&s;le; the re&s;t of their army extended along a ri&s;ing
$round, at the foot of a mountain covered with wood,
$hich protected their left, and before their front, at the
$ottom of the hill on which they were drawn up, was a
$nall brook, pa&s;&s;able only in three places, and for no more
$an four or five men a-brea&s;t. Towards the left of
$eir army was an opening, where three or four battalions
$ight have marched in front: but behind it they had
$laced three lines of infantry, and on a hill which flanked
$is opening, within mu&s;ket-&s;hot, were placed four thou|$nd
foot, with forty or fifty pieces of cannon; &s;o that,
$ reality, this was the &s;tronge&s;t part of their camp. The
$ing left nothing undone to bring the Au&s;trians to a bat|$e;
but finding them ab&s;olutely bent on avoiding it, after
$ing four days before them, he and his army returned to
$heir camp at Bern&s;tedel. They were followed by &s;ome
$f the enemy's hu&s;&s;ars and Pandours, who, however, had
$ot the &s;atisfaction to take the &s;malle&s;t booty in this re|$reat.
The Au&s;trian army, which thus declined engaging,
$as, by their own account, an hundred and thirty thou|$and
&s;trong, more than double the number of the King of
$ru&s;&s;ia, who, the day he returned to Bern&s;tedel, after he
$ad retired about two thou&s;and yards, again drew up his
$rmy in line of battle, and remained &s;o upwards of an
$our, but not a man &s;tirred from the Au&s;trian camp.
The army of the Empire, commanded by the Prince of
Saxe-Hildburghau&s;en, and that of the French under the
Prince de Soubi&s;e, making together about fifty thou&s;and
men, half of which were French, had by this time joined,
and advanced as far as Erfurth in Saxony; upon which
his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, finding that all his endeavours could
not bring the Au&s;trians to an engagement, &s;et out from
Lu&s;atia, accompanied by Mare&s;chal Keith, with &s;ixteen
battalions and forty &s;quadrons of his troops, and arrived
at Dre&s;den on the twenty-ninth of Augu&s;t, leaving the
<PB N="174" REF="176">
re&s;t of the army in a &s;trong camp, under the Prince of Be+vern.
With this detachment, which, by the junction o$
&s;everal bodies of troops, amounted to about forty thou&s;an$
men, he made a quick march, by the way of Leipzig
towards Erfurth, to give battle to the united army of th$
French and the Empire. But by the time he arrived a
Erfurth, which was on the fourteenth of September
the enemy had retreated towards Gotha; and upon hi$
further approach, they retired to Eye&s;enach, where the$
entrenched them&s;elves in a very &s;trong camp. His Ma+je&s;ty's
head-quarters were at Kir&s;chlaben, near Erfurth
While the two armies were thus &s;ituated, Major-Genera$
Seydelitz, who occupied the town of Gotha, being in+formed,
on the nineteenth, that a large body of the enemy
was coming towards him, and that it con&s;i&s;ted of tw$
regiments of Au&s;trian hu&s;&s;ars, one regiment of French
hu&s;&s;ars, and a detachment made up of French grenadiers
troops of the army of the Empire, and a great number of
Croats and Pandours, retired, and po&s;ted him&s;elf at &s;ome
di&s;tance. The enemy immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
town and ca&s;tle; but General Seydelitz, having been re|enforced,
attacked the enemy with &s;uch vigour, that he
&s;oon obliged them to abandon their new conque&s;t, and
to retire with great precipitation; a report having been
&s;pread, that the Pru&s;&s;ian army was advancing again&s;t them,
with the King him&s;elf in per&s;on. The Pru&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars
took a con&s;iderable booty on this occa&s;ion, and General
Seydelitz &s;ent pri&s;oners to the camp one lieutenant-colonel,
three majors, four lieutenants, and &s;ixty-two
&s;oldiers of the enemy, who had al&s;o about an hundred and
thirty killed. After this action his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty ad|vanced
near Eye&s;enach, with a de&s;ign to attack the com|bined
army; but they were &s;o &s;trongly entrenched that he
found it impracticable. His provi&s;ions falling &s;hort, he
was obliged to retire towards Erfurth, and &s;oon after to
Naumburgh on the river Sala; whereupon the combined
army marched, and again took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gotha, Er|furth,
<PB N="175" REF="177">
and Weimar; which la&s;t place, however, they
&s;oon after quitted.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. Upon the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's leaving Bern&s;tedel,
the Au&s;trians took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it on the &s;ixth of Septem|ber,
and made pri&s;oners a Pru&s;&s;ian battalion which had been
left there. The next day fifteen thou&s;and Au&s;trians attack|ed
two battalions of General Winterfield's troops, being
part of the Prince of Bevern's army, who were po&s;ted on a
high ground on the other &s;ide of the Nei&s;s, near Henner&s;|dorff,
in the neighbourhood of Goerlitz; and, after being
repul&s;ed &s;everal times, at la&s;t made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of
the eminence. The lo&s;s, in this action, was con&s;iderable
on both &s;ides, but greate&s;t on that of the Pru&s;&s;ians, not &s;o
much by the number of their &s;lain, which &s;carcely ex|ceeded
that of the Au&s;trians, as by the death of their brave
General Winterfield, who, as he was leading up &s;uccours
to the battalions that were engaged, received a &s;hot from
a cannon, of which he died the night following. The
Generals Nada&s;ti and Clerici, Count d'Arberg, Colonel
Elrickhau&s;en, and &s;everal other officers of di&s;tinction, were
wounded, and the young Count of Groe&s;beck and the
Marquis d'A&s;que killed, on the &s;ide of the Au&s;trians, who
took &s;ix pieces of the Pru&s;&s;ian cannon, &s;ix pair of their
colours, and made General Kemeke, the Count d'Anhalt,
and &s;ome other officers, pri&s;oners. After this &s;kirmi&s;h,
the Prince of Bevern, with the Pru&s;&s;ian army under his
command, retreated from Goerlitz to Rotenberg, then
pa&s;&s;ed the Quei&s;s at Syger&s;dorff, from whence he marched
to Buntzlau, in Sile&s;ia, and on the fir&s;t of October reached
Bre&s;lau, without &s;uffering any lo&s;s, though the numerous
army of the Au&s;trians followed him for &s;ome days. Upon
$his arrival there, he cho&s;e a very &s;trong camp on the other
&s;ide of the Oder, in order to cover the city of Bre&s;lau, to
the fortifications of which he immediately added &s;everal
new works. Though neither &s;ide had any very &s;ignal
advantage in this engagement, more than that the Au&s;tri|ans
remained ma&s;ters of the field, yet great rejoicings were
made at Vienna on account of it. The death of Gene|ral
<PB N="176" REF="178">
Winterfield was, indeed, an irreparable lo&s;s to his
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who received at the &s;ame time the
news of this mi&s;fortune, and of the Swedes having now
actually begun ho&s;tilities in Pomerania.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. A body of the French, who, let loo&s;e again&s;t
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia by the ever-memorable and &s;hameful
convention of Clo&s;ter-Seven, had entered the territories of
Halber&s;tadt and Magdeburgh, were wor&s;ted at Eglen by
a party of &s;ix hundred men, under the command of Coun
Horn, whom Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick had detach+ed
from a body of troops with which his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;t$
had &s;ent him to defend tho&s;e countries. The Pru&s;&s;ian
took pri&s;oners the Count of Lu&s;ignan, colonel, eightee$
other French officers, and four hundred &s;oldiers, and mad$
them&s;elves ma&s;ters of a con&s;iderable booty in baggage, &amp;
with the lo&s;s of only two men; and, moreover, a Frenc$
officer and forty men were made pri&s;oners at Halber&s;tad$
Upon this check the French evacuated the country
Halber&s;tadt for a little while, but returning again on $word$
twenty-ninth of September, with a con&s;iderable re-e+forcement
from Mare&s;chal Richelieu's army, which
now could ea&s;ily &s;pare, Prince Ferdinand was obliged
retire to Win&s;teben, near the city of Magdeburgh. $word$
dangers which had been hitherto kept at a di&s;tance fre$
the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions, by the &s;urpri&s;ing activity of th$
king, now drew nearer, and menaced them on all fid$
Mare&s;chal Richelieu, with eighty battalions and an hu$$dred
&s;quadrons, entered the country of Halber&s;tadt, a
levied immen&s;e contributions; whil&s;t the allied army
the French and Imperiali&s;ts, being joined by &s;ix thou&s;a$
men under General Laudohn, who had ju&s;t defeate$
regiment of Pru&s;&s;ian cavalry near Erfurth, marched
Wei&s;&s;enfels, a city in the very centre of Thuringia. $word$
Swedes had actually taken &s;ome towns in Pomerania, a
were advancing to be&s;iege Stetin, and the Au&s;trians, $word$
had made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Lignitz, and a con&s;id$$$able
part of Sile&s;ia, had now laid &s;iege to Schweidni
and were preparing to pa&s;s the Oder, in order to $word$
<PB N="177" REF="179">
the Prince of Bevern in his camp near Bre&s;lau. In the
mean time, they made frequent, and always de&s;tructive
incur&s;ions into Brandenburgh; to oppo&s;e which his
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty ordered detachments from all his regi|ments
in tho&s;e parts to join the militia of the country,
and &s;ent the Prince of Anhalt De&s;&s;au from Leipzig, with
a body of ten thou&s;and men, to guard Berlin, whil&s;t he
him&s;elf marched with the troops under his command to
Interbeck, on the frontier of the Lower Lu&s;atia, to be the
more at hand to cover Brandenburgh, and pre&s;erve the
communication with Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. While the&s;e precautions were taking, General
Haddick, with fifteen or &s;ixteen thou&s;and Au&s;trians, en|tered
Brandenburgh on the &s;ixteenth of October, and
the next day arrived before Berlin, of which city he de|manded
a contribution of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and crowns,
but contented him&s;elf with two hundred and ten thou&s;and.
The Au&s;trians pillaged two of the &s;uburbs, but before they
could do any further mi&s;chief they were obliged to retire
in great ha&s;te, at the approach of the Prince of Anhalt
De&s;&s;au, who&s;e van-guard entered the city in the evening
of their departure. This alarm, however, obliged the
Queen and the royal family of Pru&s;&s;ia to remove to Mag|deburgh
on the twenty-third; and the mo&s;t valuable re|cords
were &s;ent to the fort of Spandau, at the conflux of
the Havel and the Sphere. On the other hand, the un|fortunate
inhabitants of Leipzig now &s;elt mo&s;t &s;everly the
cruel effects of the power of their new ma&s;ter. The
Pru&s;&s;ian commandant in the city had, by order of his
King, demanded of them three hundred thou&s;and crowns,
a &s;um far greater than it was in their power to rai&s;e.
This truth they repre&s;ented, but in vain. The &s;hort
time allowed them to furni&s;h their contingents being ex|pired,
and all their efforts to comply with this demand
having proved ineffectual, they were &s;ubjected to the ri|gours
of military execution; in con&s;equence of which
their hou&s;es were occupied by the &s;oldiery, who &s;ei&s;ed
upon the be&s;t apartments, and lived at di&s;cretion; but
<PB N="178" REF="180">
the &s;um demanded could not be found. Such was the
&s;ituation of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed city, when, on the fifteenth of
October, an expre&s;s arrived, with advice that his Pru&s;&s;ian
Maje&s;ty would &s;oon be there; and accordingly he arrived
a few minutes after, attended by his life-guards. At the
&s;ame time, a rumour was &s;pread that the city would be
delivered up to pillage, which threw the inhabitants into
the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. Their fears, however, in that
re&s;pect were &s;oon abated, by his Maje&s;ty's declaring that
he was willing to &s;pare the place, upon condition that
half the &s;um required &s;hould be immediately paid. All
that could be done was to collect among the merchants,
traders, and others, fifty thou&s;and crowns; bills of Ex|change
were drawn upon Am&s;terdam and London for
&s;eventy thou&s;and crowns, and ho&s;tages were given, by
way of &s;ecurity, for the payment of thirty thou&s;and more
within a time which was agreed on. But &s;till, notwith|&s;tanding
this, the military execution was continued, even
with greater rigour than before, and all the comfort the
wretched inhabitants could obtain was, that it &s;hould
cea&s;e whenever advice &s;hould be received that their bills
were accepted.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia had tried &s;everal times
to bring the combined army under the Princes Saxe-Hild|burghau&s;en
and Soubi&s;e to an engagement upon fair
ground; but finding them bent on declining it, notwith|&s;tanding
the &s;uperiority of their numbers, he had recour&s;e
to one of tho&s;e &s;trokes in war, by which a general is better
&s;een than by the gaining of a victory. He made a feint,
&s;oon after the beginning of October, as if he intended no|thing
more than to &s;ecure his own dominions, and march
his army into winter-quarters back to Berlin, leaving
Mare&s;chal Keith, with only &s;even or eight thou&s;and men,
to defend Leipzig. Upon this the enemy took courage,
pa&s;&s;ed the Sala, and having marched up to the city, &s;um|moned
the Mare&s;chal to &s;urrender, to which he an&s;wered,
That the King, his ma&s;ter, had ordered him to de$end the
place to the la&s;t extremity, and he would obey his orders.

The enemy then thought of be&s;ieging the city; but, before
they could prepare any one implement for that purpo&s;e,
they were alarmed by the approach of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia,
who, judging that his feint would probably induce them to
take the &s;tep they did, had, by previous and private orders,
collected together all his di&s;tant detachments, &s;ome of
which were twenty leagues a&s;under, and was advancing,
by long marches, to Leipzig; upon notice of which the
enemy repa&s;&s;ed the Sala. The Pru&s;&s;ian army was rea&s;&s;em|bled
on twenty-&s;eventh of October, and remained at
Leipzig the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth, when every
body expected a battle would be fought in the plains of
Lutzen. On the thirtieth the King drew nigh that place,
and on the thirty-fir&s;t, in his way through Wei&s;&s;enfels
and Mere&s;bourg, he made five hundred men pri&s;oners of
war. The combined army had repa&s;&s;ed the Sala at Wei&s;|&s;enfels,
Mere&s;bourg, and Halle, where they broke down
the bridges, but the&s;e were &s;oon repaired, and the whole
Pru&s;&s;ian army, amounting to no more than twenty thou|&s;and
men, having pa&s;&s;ed that river, through the&s;e towns,
in each of which they left a battalion, joined again on the
third of November, in the evening, over-again&s;t the enemy,
who&s;e forces con&s;i&s;ted of forty thou&s;and French, and
twenty-five thou&s;and Imperiali&s;ts. On the fifth, about
nine o'clock in the morning, the Pru&s;&s;ians received intel|ligence
that the enemy were every where in motion.
They likewi&s;e heard the drums beating the march, and,
&s;o near were the two armies to each other, plainly perceived
from their camp, that their whole infantry, which had
drawn nearer upon the ri&s;ing grounds over again&s;t them,
was filing off towards their right. No certain judgement
could, however, yet be formed of the enemy's real de&s;ign,
and, as they were in want of bread, it was thought proba|ble
that they intended to repa&s;s the Un&s;trut: but it was
&s;oon perceived that their &s;everal motions were contra|dictory
to each other. At the &s;ame time that &s;ome of
their infantry were filing off towards their right, a large
body of cavalry wheeled round towards their le&s;t, direct|ing
<PB N="180" REF="182">
its march all along to the ri&s;ing grounds with which
the whole Pru&s;&s;ian camp, that lay in a bottom between
the villages of Rederow and Ro&s;bach, was &s;urrounded,
within the reach of large cannon. Soon after that, the ca|valry
were &s;een to halt, and afterwards to fall back to the
right; though &s;ome of them &s;till remained where they
were, whil&s;t the re&s;t marched back. About two in the
afternoon the doubts of the Pru&s;&s;ians were cleared up; it
plainly appearing then that the enemy intended to attack
them, and that their di&s;po&s;itions were made with a view
to &s;urround them, and to open the action by attacking
them in the rear. A body of re&s;erve was po&s;ted over
again&s;t Rederow, to fall upon their routed troops, in $a&s;e
they &s;hould be defeated, and to prevent their retiring to
Mere&s;bourg, the only retreat which could then have
been le&s;t them. In this &s;ituation the King of Pru&s;&s;ia re|&s;olved
to attack them. His Maje&s;ty had determined to
make the attack with one wing only, and the di&s;po&s;ition
of the enemy made it nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be the left
wing. The very in&s;tant the battle was going to begin,
his Maje&s;ty ordered the general who commanded the
right wing to decline engaging, to take a proper po&s;ition
in con&s;equence thereof, and, above all, to prevent his
being &s;urrounded. All the cavalry of the right wing of
the Pru&s;&s;ians, except two or three &s;quadrons, had already
marched to the le&s;t at $ull gallop; and being arrived at
the place a&s;&s;igned them, they formed over again&s;t that of
the enemy. They then moved on immediately, the
enemy's advanced to meet them, and the charge was very
&s;ierce, &s;everal regiments of the French coming on with
great re&s;olution. The advantage, however, was entirely
on the &s;ide of the Pru&s;&s;ians. The enemy's cavalry being
routed, were pur&s;ued $or a con&s;iderable time with great
&s;pirit, but having afterwards reached an eminence, which
gave them an opportunity of rallying, the Pru&s;&s;ian cavalry
fell upon them afre&s;h, and gave them &s;o total a defeat,
that they $led the utmo&s;t di&s;order. This happened at
four in the afternoon. Whil&s;t the cavalry of the Pr$&s;&s;&s;ians
<PB N="181" REF="183">
charged, their infantry opened. The enemy cannonaded
them bri&s;kly during this interval, and did &s;ome execution,
but the Pru&s;&s;ian artillery $as not idle. After this can|nonading
had continued o$ both &s;ides a full quarter of an
hour, without the lea&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion, the $ire of the infan|try
began. The enemy could not &s;tand it, nor re&s;i&s;t the
valour of the Pru&s;&s;ian foot, who gallantly marched up to
their batteries. The batterie$ were carried one after ano|ther,
and the enemy were forced to give way, which they
did in great confu&s;ion. As the left wing of the Pru&s;&s;ians
advanced, the right changed its po&s;ition, and having &s;oon
met with a &s;mall ra&s;ing ground, they availed them&s;elves of
it, by planting it with &s;ixteen pieces of heavy artillery.
The fire from thence was partly pointed at the enemy's
right, to increa&s;e the di&s;order there, and took their left
wing in front, which was exce&s;&s;ively ga$led thereby. At
five the victory was decided, the cannonading cea&s;ed, and
the enemy fled on all &s;ides. They were pur&s;ued as long
as there was any light to di&s;tingui&s;h them, and it may be
&s;aid, that might alone was the pre&s;ervation of this army,
which had been &s;o formidable in the morning. They
took the benefit of the darkne&s;s to hurry into Fryb$rgh,
and there to repa&s;s the Un&s;trut, which they did on $he
morning of the &s;ixth, after a whole night's march. T$$
King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;et out early in the morning to pur&s;ue
them with all his cavalry, &s;upported by four battalions of
grenadiers, the infantry following them in two columns.
The enemy had pa&s;&s;ed the Un&s;trut at Fryburgh, when the
Pru&s;&s;ians arrived on its banks, and as they had burnt the
bridge, it became nece&s;&s;ary to make another, which, how|ever,
was &s;oon done. The cavalry pa&s;&s;ed fir&s;t, but could
not come up with the enemy till five in the evening, upon
the hills of Ecker&s;berg. It was then too late to force
them there, for which rea&s;on the King thought proper to
canton his army in the neare&s;t villages, and to be &s;atisfied
with the &s;ucce&s;s his hu&s;&s;ars had in taking near three hun|dred
baggage-waggons, and every thing they contained.
The whole lo&s;s of the Pru&s;&s;ians, in this important engage|ment,
<PB N="182" REF="184">
did not exceed five hundred men killed and
wounded. Among the former was General Meincke,
and among the latter Prince Henry and General S$yde|litz.
The enemy lo&s;t &s;ixty-four pieces of cannon, a great
many &s;tandards and colours, near three thou&s;and men
killed on the $ield of battle, and upwards of eight thou&s;and
taken pri&s;oners, among whom were &s;everal generals, and
other officers of di&s;tinction. Three hundred waggons
were &s;ent to Leipzig, laden with wounded French and
Swi&s;s. Upon the approach of the Pru&s;&s;ians towards
Ecker&s;berg, the enemy retreated with great precipitation;
and, after marching all night, arrived the next day at Er|furth,
in the utmo&s;t want of every nece&s;&s;ary of life, not
having had a mor&s;el of bread for two days, during which
they had been obliged to live upon turneps, radi&s;hes, and
other roots, which they dug out of the earth. The French,
under the Duke de Richelieu, were preparing to go into
winter-quarters; but, upon the news of this defeat of the
combined army, they again put them&s;elves in motion, and
a large detachment of them advanced as far as Duder&s;tadt,
to favour the retreat of their countrymen under the Prince
de Soubi&s;e, who, with great precipitancy, made the be&s;t of
their way from Erfurth to the county of Hohen&s;tein, and
from thence bent their march towards Halber&s;tadt. Of
the remains of the Imperial army, which was now almo&s;t
entirely di&s;per&s;ed, whole bodies de&s;erted, and went over
to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, &s;oon after this battle.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. Whil&s;t his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was thus &s;ucce&s;sful
again&s;t the French and Imperiali&s;ts, the Au&s;trians, who
had carefully avoided coming to an open engagement with
him, gained ground a-pace in Sile&s;ia. A detachment of
their army, under the command of Count Nada&s;ti, had
already inve&s;ted Schweidnitz, and opened the trenches
before it on the twenty-&s;ixth of October. The Pru&s;&s;ian
garri&s;on, commanded by General de la Motte Fouquet,
determined to de&s;end the place as long as po&s;&s;ible; and
accordingly on the thirtieth they made a &s;ally, in which
they killed, wounded, and took pri&s;oners, eight hundred
<PB N="183" REF="185">
of the be&s;iegers, and did &s;ome damage to their works; but
on the &s;ixth of November the Au&s;trians began to can|nonade
the city furiou&s;ly, and on the eleventh made them|&s;elves
ma&s;ters of the ramparts by a&s;&s;ault. The garris&s;on,
however, having taken care, during the &s;iege, to throw up a
&s;trong entrenchment in the market-place, retreated thither,
and held out till the next day, when they &s;urrendered
them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. After the reduction of this
place, General Nada&s;ti, leaving in it a &s;ufficient garri&s;on,
marched with the remainder of his troops, and joined the
main army of the Au&s;trians, under the command of Prince
Charles of Lorraine and Mare&s;ehal Daun, who, whil&s;t he
was bu&s;ied in the &s;iege of Schweidnitz, had inve&s;ted Bre&s;|lau
on the le&s;t of the Oder; the Prince of Bevern de|fending
it on the right, where he was &s;trongly encamped,
with his little army, under the cannon of the city. The
whole army of the Au&s;trians being now rea&s;&s;embled,
and intelligence having been brought, not only of the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia's late victory near Leipzig, but al&s;o that
he was advancing to the relief of the Prince of Bevern, it
was re&s;olved immediately to attack the la&s;t in his en|trenchments.
Accordingly, on the twenty-&s;econd of No|vember,
about nine in the morning, the Au&s;trians began
a mo&s;t furious di&s;charge of their cannon, forty of which
were twenty-four pounders, and this continued without
cea&s;ing till one, when it was &s;ucceeded by a &s;evere fire of
their &s;mall arms, which la&s;ted till five in the evening.
The Pru&s;&s;ians, with undaunted re&s;olution, &s;tood two of
the mo&s;t violent attacks that were ever made, but at the
third, overpowered by numbers, and a&s;&s;ailed on both &s;ides,
they began to lo&s;e ground, and were forced to retire from
one entrenchment to another. In this extremity, night
coming on, the Pru&s;&s;ian generals fearing their entrench|ments
would be entirely forced, and that they &s;hould then
be totally defeated, thought proper to retreat. The Prince
of Bevern, with the greate&s;t part of the army, retired to
an eminence on the banks of the Oder, whil&s;t the re&s;t
of the troops threw them&s;elves into Bre&s;lau, which they
<PB N="184" REF="186">
might have defended, in all probability, till the King had
come up to its relief. But, on the twenty-fourth, their
commander in chief, the Prince of Bevern, going to re|connoitre
the enemy, with only a &s;ingle groom to attend
him, fell in among a party of Croats, who took him pri|&s;oner<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">We are told, that he mi&s;took the&s;e Croats for Pru&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars. But &s;ome of the circum&s;tance of this my&s;terious affair were interpreted into a premedi|tated de&s;ign in the Prince to be taken pri&s;oner. It cannot otherwi&s;e be &s;up|po&s;ed that a man of his rank, a prince, a commander in chief, &s;hould officiou&s;ly undertake the always dangerous ta&s;k of reconnoitring the enemy, with &s;o &s;light an attendance as only one man, and that but a groom, even if he had judged it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ee things with his own eyes. Some &s;ecret di&s;&s;atisfaction, hither to unknown to us, may po&s;&s;ibly have been the cau&s;e of his taking this &s;$ep; or, which &s;eems &s;till more probable, he might be a&s;hamed, or, perhaps, even afraid to &s;ee the King his ma&s;ter, after having &s;o injudiciou&s;ly abandoned the defence of Bre&s;lau, by qui$$$ing his lines, which, it is a&s;&s;erted, his Pru&s;&s;i$n Maje&s;ty had &s;ent him expre&s;s orders not to quit on any account what ever, for that he would certainly be with him by the fifth of December, in which we &s;hall find he kept his word.</NOTE>.
His army, thus deprived of their general, re|treated
northward that night, leaving in Bre&s;lau only
four battalions, who, the next day, &s;urrendered the place
by capitulation, one of the articles of which was, that they
&s;hould not &s;erve again&s;t the Empre&s;s, or her allies, for two
years. All the magazines, che&s;ts, artillery, &amp;c. remained
in the hands of the Au&s;trians. The garri&s;on marched out
with all military honours, conducted by General Le&s;witz,
governor of Bre&s;lau. Though the Au&s;trians &s;ung <HI>Te
Deum</HI> for this victory, they owned that &s;uch another would
put an end to their army, for it co&s;t them the lives of
twelve thou&s;and men; a number almo&s;t equal to the
whole of the Pru&s;&s;ian army before the battle. They had
four almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible intrenchments to force, planted
thick with cannon, which fired cartridge-&s;hot from nine
in the morning till the evening, and the Pru&s;&s;ians, when
attacked, were never once put into the lea&s;t confu&s;ion.
Among the &s;lain, on the &s;ide of the Au&s;trians, were Ge|neral
Wurben, and &s;everal other officers of di&s;tinction.
The lo&s;s of the Pru&s;&s;ians did not much exceed three thou|$&s;and
men, in killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners, of which
<PB N="185" REF="187">
la&s;t there were about &s;ixteen hundred. Their General
Klei&s;t was found dead on the field of battle.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who, like Cae&s;ar, thought
nothing was done while any thing was left undone, &s;taid
no longer at Ro&s;bach than till the routed forces of the
French and Imperiali&s;ts, whom he had defeated there on
the fifth of November, were totally di&s;per&s;ed. Then he
marched directly with the greate&s;t part of his army for
Sile&s;ia, and on the twenty-fourth of that month arrived
at Naumburg on the Quei&s;s, a little river which runs into
the Bobber, having in his route detached Mare&s;chal
Keith, with the re&s;t of his army, to clear Saxony from all
the Au&s;trian parties, and then to make an irruption into
Bohemia, a &s;ervice which he performed &s;o effectually as
to rai&s;e large contributions in the circles of Satz and
Leitmeritz, and even to give an alarm to Prague it&s;elf.
His Maje&s;ty re&s;erved for him&s;elf only fifteen thou&s;and men,
with whom he advanced, with his u&s;ual rapidity, to
Barchwitz, where, notwith&s;tanding all that had happened
at Schweidnitz and at Bre&s;lau, he was joined by twenty-four
thou&s;and more; part of them troops which he had
ordered from Saxony, part the remains of the army lately
commanded by the Prince of Bevern, and part the late
garri&s;on of Schweidnitz, which had found means to
e&s;cape from the Au&s;trians, and accidentally joined their
King upon his march<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Whil&s;t the Au&s;trians were conducting them to pri&s;on, on their route they chanced to hear of the victory their ma&s;ter had gained at Ro&s;bach. Ani|mated by the&s;e tidings, they unanimou&s;ly ro&s;e upon the e&s;cort that guarded them, which, happening not to be very &s;trong, they entirely di&s;per&s;ed. Thus freed, they marched on, not very certain of their way, in hopes to rejoin &s;ome corps of the Pru&s;&s;ian troops, their countrymen. The &s;ame fortune which freed them led them directly to the army commanded by the King him&s;elf, which was ha&s;tening to their relief, as well as to that of the Prince of Be|ver$. This unexpected meeting was equally plea&s;ing to both, the pri&s;oner, not having heard any thing of his Maje&s;ty's march; and, at the &s;ame time, this lucky incident, whil&s;t it added a con&s;iderable &s;trength to the army, added likewi&s;e to its confidence, for the &s;lighte&s;t occurrence is con&s;trued into anomen, by an army at the eve of an engagement.</NOTE>. With this force, though greatly
inferior in number to that of the enemy, he re&s;olved to
attack the Au&s;trians, who were entrenched at Li&s;&s;a near
<PB N="186" REF="188">
Bre&s;lau. On the fourth of December he &s;ei&s;ed upon their
ovens at Neumarck, and upon a con&s;iderable magazine,
guarded by two regiments of Croats, who retired to a
ri&s;ing ground, where his Maje&s;ty ordered his hu&s;&s;ars to
&s;urround them, and &s;end a trumpet to &s;ummon them to
&s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. Upon their refu&s;al,
the hu&s;&s;ars of Zithen fell upon them &s;abre in hand, and
&s;ome hundreds of them having been cut in pieces, the re&s;t
threw down their arms, begging for quarter on their knees.
After this &s;$i&s;ure, and after having di&s;tributed to his army
the bread prepared for his enemies, he began again the
next morning his march towards Li&s;&s;a. General Zithen,
who led the vanguard of light hor&s;e, about &s;even in the
morning fell in with a body of Au&s;trian hu&s;&s;ars, and three
regiments of Saxon dragoons, which were the very be&s;t
cavalry the enemy had left after the battle of the twenty-&s;econd.
They had been detached by the Au&s;trians, in
order to retard the King's march, and to conceal their own,
till their batteries &s;hould be completed; for, as they held
the &s;mall number of the Pru&s;&s;ians in contempt, their in|tention
was to have met the King two German miles from
their entrenchments. The Au&s;trian cavalry having been
vigorou&s;ly repul&s;ed to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, General
Zithen perceived that their whole army was forming.
He immediately acquainted the King with what he had
di&s;covered, and his Maje&s;ty, after having him&s;elf ob&s;erved
the di&s;po&s;ition of the enemy, made his own with that &s;a|gacity
and di&s;patch for which he has always been re|markable.
The action began by attacking a battery of
forty pieces of large cannon, which covered the right wing
of the enemy. The two battalions of guards, with the
regiments of the Margrave Charles and of It zenplitz,
marched up, amid&s;t a mo&s;t terrible $ire, to the very
mouths of the cannon, with their bayonets &s;crewed. In
this attack the Pru&s;&s;ians &s;u&s;tained their greate&s;t lo&s;s, though
the battery was carried as &s;oon almo&s;t as they could reach
it: then the enemy's artillery, now turned again&s;t them|&s;elves,
plaved furiou&s;ly upon them with their own powder.
<PB N="187" REF="189">
From that in&s;tant the two wings and the centre of the
Pru&s;&s;ians continued to drive the enemy before them, ad|vancing
all the time with that firm and regular pace for
which they have always been renowned, without ever
halting or giving way. The ground which the Au&s;trians
occupied was very advantageous, and every circum&s;tance
that could render it more &s;o had been improved to the
utmo&s;t by the diligence and &s;kill of Count Daun, who,
remembering his former &s;ucce&s;s, was emboldened to enter
the li&s;ts again with his royal antagoni&s;t. The Pru&s;&s;ians,
however, no way terrified by the enemy's &s;ituation, nor
their numbers, went calmly and dreadfully forward. It
was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, in the beginning, for the Pru&s;&s;ian
cavalry to act, on account of the impediments of fallen
trees, which the enemy had cut down and laid in the field
of battle, to retard their approach; but a judicious di&s;po|&s;ition
which the King made overcame that di&s;advantage.
When he fir&s;t formed his army, he had placed four bat|talions
behind the cavalry of his right wing, fore&s;eeing
that General Nada&s;ti, who was placed with a corps of re|&s;erve
on the enemy's left, de&s;igned to take him in $lank.
It happened as he had fore&s;een, this general's hor&s;e at|tacked
the King's right wing with great fury: but he
was received with &s;o &s;evere a fire from the four battalions,
that he was obliged to retire in di&s;order. The enemy
gave way on all &s;ides, but at &s;ome di&s;tance recovered
them&s;elves, and rallied three times, animated by their
officers, and by the &s;uperiority of their numbers. Every
time they made a &s;tand, the Pru&s;&s;ians attacked them with
redoubled vigour, and with &s;ucce&s;s equal to their bravery.
Towards night, the enemy, &s;till retreating, fell into di&s;|order.
Their two wings fled in confu&s;ion; one of them,
clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed by the King, retired towards Bre&s;lau, and
took &s;helter under the cannon of that city; the other,
pur&s;ued by the greate&s;t part of the light cavalry, took
their flight towards Canth and Schweidnitz. Six thou|&s;and
Au&s;trians &s;ell in this engagement, and the Pru&s;&s;ians,
who had only five hundred men killed, and two thou&s;and
<PB N="188" REF="190">
three hundred wounded, made upwards of ten thou&s;and
of the enemy pri&s;oners, among whom were two hundred
and ninety-one officers. They al&s;o took an hundred and
&s;ixteen cannon, fifty-one colours and &s;tandards, and four
thou&s;and waggons of ammunition and baggage. The
con&s;equences that followed this victory declared its im|portance.
Future ages will read with a&s;toni&s;hment, that
the &s;ame prince, who but a few months before &s;eemed on
the verge of inevitable ruin, merely by the dint of his own
abilities, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any friend whatever,
with troops perpetually harra&s;&s;ed by long and painful
marches, and by continual &s;kirmi&s;hes and battles, not only
retrieved his affairs, which almo&s;t every one except him|&s;elf
thought pa&s;t redre&s;s; but, in the mid&s;t of winter, in
countries where it was judged next to impo&s;&s;ible for any
troops to keep the $ield at that &s;ea&s;on, conquered the united
force of France and the Empire at Ro&s;bach on the fifth of
November, and on the &s;ame day of the very next month,
with a great part of the &s;ame army, was at Li&s;&s;a, where he
again triumphed over all the power of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.
Pur&s;uing his advantage, he immediately inve&s;ted Bre&s;lau,
and within two days after this great victory every thing
was in readine&s;s to be&s;iege it in form. His troops, flu&s;hed
with &s;ucce&s;s, were at fir&s;t for &s;torming it, but the King,
knowing the &s;trength of the garri&s;on, which con&s;i&s;ted of
upwards of thirteen thou&s;and men, and con&s;idering both
the fatigues which his own &s;oldiers had lately undergone,
and the fatal con&s;equences that might en&s;ue, &s;hould they
fail of &s;ucce&s;s in this attempt, ordered the approaches to
be carried on in the u&s;ual form. His commands were
obeyed, and Bre&s;lau &s;urrendered to him on the twentieth
of December in the morning. The garri&s;on, of which
ten thou&s;and bore arms, and between three and four
thou&s;and lay &s;ick or wounded, were made pri&s;oners of war.
Fourteen of the&s;e pri&s;oners were officers of high rank.
The military che&s;t, a va&s;t trea&s;ure, with eighty pieces of
cannon, $ell into the hands of the victors, who lo&s;t only
about twenty men in their approaches. During the &s;iege, a
<PB N="189" REF="191">
magazine of powder was &s;et on &s;ire by a bomb, which
occa&s;ioned great confu&s;ion among the be&s;ieged, and da|maged
one of the ba&s;tions. The &s;trong fortre&s;s of
Schweidnitz &s;till remained in the enemy's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, de|fended
by a garri&s;on &s;o numerous, that it might be com|pared
to a &s;mall army, and whil&s;t that continued &s;o, the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia's victories in Sile&s;ia were of no deci&s;ive
effect. For this rea&s;on, though it was now the dead of
winter, and the &s;oldiers &s;tood in need of repo&s;e his Ma|je&s;ty
re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to become ma&s;ter of that place
before the end of the year; but as a clo&s;e &s;iege was im|practicable,
a blockade was formed, as &s;trictly as the rigour
of the &s;ea&s;on would permit<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Such was the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, that &s;ome hundreds of the &s;entinels dropped down dead on their &s;everal polls, unable to &s;u&s;tain the &s;everity of the cold. The Germans lie under the general reproach of paying very little regard to the lives of their &s;oldiers, and indeed this practice of winter-campaigns in &s;uch a cold country be&s;peaks very little regard to the dictates of humanity</NOTE>. It was not, however, till
the beginning of the en&s;uing campaign that this place was
taken. The Pru&s;&s;ians opened their trenches before it on
the third of April, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-eight,
and erected two large batteries, which kept a con|tinual
fire upon the town. The artillery of the be&s;iegers
con&s;i&s;ted of three hundred pieces of cannon, of different
dimen&s;ions, and eighty mortars; an amazing artillery,
and &s;uch as we have never heard of in former campaigns.
On the night of the fourteenth, the Pru&s;&s;ians carried
one of the chief works by a&s;&s;ault, and lodged them&s;elves
therein; the commandant capitulated the next day, with
the garri&s;on, which was now greatly reduced in number,
being not half of what it amounted to at the beginning of
the blockade. Thus, all the parts of Sile&s;ia which the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia had lo&s;t by one unfortunate blow fell again
into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and his affairs, which but a few months
before &s;eemed irretrievable, were now re-e&s;tabli&s;hed upon
a firmer ba&s;is than ever. The Pru&s;&s;ian parties not only
re-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of tho&s;e parts of Sile&s;ia which be|longed
to their king, but penetrated into the Au&s;trian di|vi&s;ion,
reduced Jagerndor&s;, Troppau, Tretchen, and
<PB N="190" REF="192">
&s;everal other places, and left the Empre&s;s-Queen &s;carce
any footing in that country, in which, a few days before,
&s;he reckoned her dominion perfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The Swedes, after many debates between their
king and &s;enate, had at length re&s;olved upon an open
declaration again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and, in con&s;e|quence
of that re&s;olution, &s;ent &s;o many troops into Po|merania,
that, by the end of Augu&s;t, their army in that
country amounted to twenty-five thou&s;and men. Their
fir&s;t act of ho&s;tility was the &s;ei&s;ure of Anclam and Demmin,
two towns that lay in the way to Stetin, again&s;t which
their principal de&s;ign was levelled. But before they
proceeded farther, General Hamilton, their commander,
by way of ju&s;tifying the conduct of his ma&s;ter, publi&s;hed
a declaration, &s;etting forth, &startq;That the King of Sweden,
as guarantee of the treaty of We&s;tphalia, could not help
&s;ending his troops into the upper part of the duchy of
Pomerania belonging to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia; and that,
therefore, all the officers appointed to receive the publick
revenue in that country mu&s;t pay what money they had
in their hands to him, who was commi&s;&s;ioned to receive
it for his Swedi&s;h Maje&s;ty: That, moreover, an exact
account was required, within eight days, of the reve|nues
of the country; but that no more than ordinary
contributions would be demanded of the inhabitants,
who might re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that the Swedi&s;h troops &s;hould ob|&s;erve
the &s;tricte&s;t di&s;cipline.&endq; After this declaration they
attacked the little fortre&s;s of Penemunde, upon the river
Pene, and on the twenty-third of September, after
a &s;iege of nine days, obliged the garri&s;on, which
con&s;i&s;ted only of militia, to &s;urrender them&s;elves
pri&s;oners of war. This alternative the command|ing
officer cho&s;e, rather than engage not to &s;erve
for two years, ob&s;erving, that &s;uch an engagement was
incon&s;i&s;tent with his honour, whil&s;t his prince had &s;o
much occa&s;ion for his &s;ervice; and the Swedi&s;h general,
touched with this noble way of thinking, was, on his
part, &s;o generous as to give him his liberty. On the
<PB N="191" REF="193">
other hand, General Manteuffell, who commanded the
Pru&s;&s;ian forces then in Pomerania, amounting to twelve
thou&s;and men, with whom he was encamped before Ste|tin,
to cover that place, publi&s;hed in an&s;wer to this a de|claration,
enjoining the inhabitants of Pomerania to re|main
faithful to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, their lawful &s;ove|reign,
under pain of incurring his ju&s;t indignation, and
ab&s;olutely forbidding them to pay any regard to the Swe|di&s;h
manife&s;to.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. In the mean time, Mare&s;chal Lehwald, im|mediately
after the battle of Norkitten, when the Ru&s;&s;ians
began their retreat, detached Prince George of Hol&s;tein-Gottorp,
with a con&s;iderable body of forces, to the re|lief
of Pomerania; and, &s;hortly after, the Ru&s;&s;ian forces
having totally evacuated every part of Pru&s;&s;ia, except
Memel, and mo&s;t of them being actually gone into
winter-quarters, he him&s;elf followed, with an additional
re-enforcement of &s;ixteen thou&s;and men. Upon his ap|proach,
the Swedes, who were then encamped at Ferdi|nand&s;hoff,
and had begun to fill up the harbour of Swinne|munde,
by way of previous preparation for the &s;iege of
Stetin, retired with &s;uch precipitation, that they did not
allow them&s;elves time to draw off a little garri&s;on they
had at Wollin, con&s;i&s;ting of two hundred and ten men,
who were made pri&s;oners of war. Demmin was cannon|aded
by the Pru&s;&s;ians on the twenty-ninth of December;
and the Swedes having lo&s;t one officer and forty men, de|&s;ired
to capitulate. As, in order to ca&s;e the troops, it was
not thought proper to continue the &s;iege in &s;o &s;harp a
&s;ea&s;on, their reque&s;t was granted, and they had leave to
retire with two pieces of cannon. The Pru&s;&s;ians took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town on the &s;econd day of January,
after the Swedes had, on the thirtieth of December, like|wi&s;e
given up Anclam, where the conquerors took an
hundred and fifty pri&s;oners, and found a con&s;iderable
magazine of provi&s;ions and ammunition. Mare&s;chal
Lehwald then pa&s;&s;ed the Pene, entered Swedi&s;h Pome|$ania,
and reduced Gutz$ow, Loitz, Trip&s;$s, and Ne|bringen.
<PB N="192" REF="194">
At the &s;ame time, Lieutenant-General Schor|lemmer
pa&s;&s;ed with his corps from the i&s;le of Wollin into
the i&s;le of U&s;edom, and from thence to Wolga&s;t, the
Swedes having abandoned this town, as well as Schwine|munde,
and the fort of Penemunde. The Prince of
Hol&s;tein advanced as far as Grimm and Grie&s;$swalde,
and the Swedes, lo&s;ing one town after another, till they
had nothing le&s;t in Pomerania but the port of Stral$und,
continued retreating till they had reached this la&s;t place.
The French party in Sweden, to comfort the people,
called this retreat, or rather flight, going into winter-quarters.
The Pru&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars were not idle wherever
they penetrated; for, be&s;ides plundering and pillaging,
they rai&s;ed a contribution of an hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and
crowns in Swedi&s;h Pomerania. The Mecklenburghers,
who had joined the Swedes with &s;ix thou&s;and of their
troops, now found cau&s;e to repent of their forwardne&s;s,
being left quite expo&s;ed to the re&s;entment of the victors,
who cha&s;ti&s;ed them with the mo&s;t &s;evere exactions. The
army of the Swedes, though they did not fight a battle,
was, by &s;ickne&s;s, de&s;ertion, and other accidents, reduced
to half the number it con&s;i&s;ted of when they took the field.
The Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, &s;oon after his territories
were invaded by the French, in con&s;equence of their ad|vantage
in the affair of Ha&s;tenbeck, had applied to the
King of Sweden, as one of the guarantees of the treaty
of We&s;tphalia, de&s;iring him to employ his good offices
with the court of France, to obtain a more favourable
treatment for his dominions: but his Swedi&s;h Maje&s;ty,
by the advice of the &s;enate, thought proper to refu&s;e com|plying
with this reque&s;t, alledging, that as the crown of
Sweden was one of the principal guarantees of the treaty
of We&s;tphalia, it would be highly improper to take &s;uch a
&s;tep, in favour of a prince who had not only broke the laws
and con&s;titutions of the empire, in refu&s;ing to furni&s;h
his contingent, but had even a&s;&s;i&s;ted with his troops a
power known to be its declared enemy. The Aulick
council too, &s;eeing, or pretending to &s;ee, the behaviour of
<PB N="193" REF="195">
the Landgrave in the &s;ame light, i&s;&s;ued a decree again&s;t
his Serene Highne&s;s towards the end of this year.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. The court of Great-Britain, ju&s;tly di&s;plea&s;ed
with the Dutch, on account of the extreme facility with
which they had granted the French a free pa&s;&s;age through
Namur and Mae&s;tricht for their provi&s;ions, ammunition,
and artillery, in the beginning of this campaign, had
very properly remon&s;trated again&s;t that &s;tep, before it was
ab&s;olutely re&s;olved on, or at lea&s;t declared to be &s;o: but
in vain; a pu&s;illanimous an&s;wer being all the &s;atisfaction
that was obtained. The tamene&s;s and indifference with
which the States-General had &s;ince &s;een O&s;tend and Nieu|port
put into the hands of the French drew upon their
High Mightine&s;&s;es a further remon&s;tance, which was
delivered to them on the twenty-eighth of November of this
year by Colonel Yorke, his Britannick Maje&s;ty's pleni|potentiary
at the Hague, in the following terms, well
calculated to awaken in them a due &s;en&s;e of their own
danger, as well as to evince the inju&s;tice of the proceed|ings
of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria:&mdash;&startq;Con&s;idering the critical
&s;ituation which Europe has been in during the cour&s;e of
this year, in con&s;equence of mea&s;ures concerted to embroil
all Europe, the King of Great-Britain was willing to
flatter him&s;elf that the courts of Vienna and Ver&s;ailles,
out of regard to the circum&s;pect conduct ob&s;erved by your
High Mightine&s;&s;es, would have at lea&s;t informed you of
the changes they have thought proper to make in the
Au&s;trian Netherlands. It was with the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e
the King heard, that without any previous con&s;ent of
your's, and almo&s;t without giving you any notice, the
court of Vienna had thought proper to put the towns of
O&s;tend and Nieuport into the hands of the French troops,
and to withdraw her own, as well as her artillery and
&s;tores, whil&s;t France continues to &s;end thither a formidable
quantity of both. The conduct of the court of Vienna
towards his Maje&s;ty is indeed &s;o unmerited and &s;o ex|traordinary,
that it is difficult to find words to expre&s;s it:
but whatever $allacious pretexts &s;he may have made u&s;e of
<PB N="194" REF="196">
to palliate her behaviour towards England, it doth not
appear that it can be extended &s;o far as to excu&s;e the
infringement, in concert with France, of the mo&s;t &s;olemn
treaties between her and your High Mightine&s;&s;es. The
King never doubted that your High Mightine&s;&s;es would
have made proper repre&s;entations to the two courts newly
allied, to demon&s;trate the inju&s;tice of &s;uch a proceeding,
and the danger that might afterwards re&s;ult from it.
Your High Mightine&s;&s;es will have perceived that your
&s;ilence on the fir&s;t &s;tep encouraged the two courts, newly
allied, to attempt others; and who can &s;ay where they
will &s;top? The pretext at fir&s;t was, the need which the
Empre&s;s-Queen &s;tood in of the troops for the war kindled
in the empire, and the nece&s;&s;ity of providing for the &s;afety
of tho&s;e important places, and afterwards of their imagi|nary
danger from England. But, High and Mighty
Lords, it is but too evident that the two powers, who
have taken the&s;e mea&s;ures in concert, have other projects
in view, and have made new regulations with regard to
that country, which cannot but alarm the neighbouring
&s;tates. The late demand made to your High Mightine&s;&s;es,
of a pa&s;&s;age for a large train of warlike implements through
&s;ome of the barrier towns, in order to be &s;ent to O&s;tend
and Nieuport, could not fail to awaken the King's atten|tion.
The &s;incere friend&s;hip, and parity of intere&s;ts, of
Great-Britain and Holland require that they &s;hould no
longer keep &s;ilence, le&s;t, in the i&s;&s;ue, it &s;hould be con&s;ider|ed
as a tacit con&s;ent, and as a relinqui&s;hment of all our
rights. The King commands me, therefore, to recall
to your High Mightine&s;&s;es the two-fold right you have
acquired to keep the Au&s;trian Netherlands under the go|vernment
of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and that no other has
a title to make the lea&s;t alteration therein, without the
con&s;ent of your High Mightine&s;&s;es; unle&s;s the new allies
have re&s;olved to &s;et a&s;ide all prior treaties, and to di&s;po&s;e at
plea&s;ure of every thing that may &s;uit their private intere&s;t.
In the treaty between your High Mightine&s;&s;es and the
crown of France, &s;igned at Utrecht on the eleventh of
<PB N="195" REF="197">
April, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and thirteen, in the
fifteenth article, are the&s;e words: 'It is al&s;o agreed,
that no province, fort, town, or city of the &s;aid Nether|lands,
or of tho&s;e which are given up by his Catholick
Maje&s;ty, &s;hall ever be ceded, transferred, or given, or
&s;hall ever devolve to the crown of France, or any prince
or prince&s;s of the hou&s;e or line of France, either by
virtue of any gift, exchange, marriage-contract, &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
by will, or by any other title whatever, to the
power and authority of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, or of
any prince or prince&s;s of the hou&s;e or line of France.
'In the barrier-treaty the&s;e very &s;tipulations are repeated in
the fir&s;t article: 'His Imperial and Catholick Maje&s;ty
promi&s;es and engages, that no province, city, town,
fortre&s;s, or territory of the &s;aid country &s;hall be ceded,
transferred, given, or devolve to the crown of France,
or to any other but the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the German domi|nions
of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, either by donation, &s;ale, ex|change,
marriage-contract, heritage, te&s;tamentary &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
nor under any other pretext what&s;oever; &s;o that
no province, town, fortre&s;s, or territory of the &s;aid Ne|therlands
&s;hall ever be &s;ubject to any other prince, but to
the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the &s;tates of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria alone,
excepting what has been yielded by the pre&s;ent treaty to
the &s;aid lords the States-General.' A bare reading of
the&s;e two articles is &s;ufficient to evince all that I have ju&s;t
repre&s;ented to your High Mightine&s;&s;es: and whatever pre|text
the courts of Vienna and Ver&s;ailles may alledge, to
cover the infraction of the&s;e treaties, the thing remains
neverthele&s;s evident, whil&s;t the&s;e two courts are unable to
prove that the towns of O&s;tend and Nieuport are not
actually in the power of France. If their de&s;igns are
ju&s;t, or agreeable to tho&s;e treaties, they will doubtle&s;s
not &s;cruple, in the lea&s;t, to make your High Mightine&s;&s;es
ea&s;y on that head, by openly explaining them&s;elves to a
quiet and pacifick neighbour, and by giving you indi&s;|putable
proofs of their intentions to fulfil the &s;tipulations
of the &s;aid two treaties, with regard to the Netherlands.
<PB N="196" REF="198">
The King hath &s;o much confidence in the good &s;en&s;e,
prudence and friend&s;hip of your High Mightine&s;&s;es, that
he makes not the lea&s;t doubt of your taking the mo&s;t effi|cacious
mea&s;ures to clear up an affair of &s;uch importance;
and of your being plea&s;ed, in concert with his Maje&s;ty,
to watch over the fate of a country, who&s;e &s;ituation and
independence have, for more than a century, been re|garded
as one of the principal &s;upports of your liberty and
commerce.&endq; It does not appear that this remon&s;trance had
the de&s;ired effect upon the States-General, who were ap|prehen&s;ive
of embroiling them&s;elves with an enemy &s;o re|markably
alert in taking all advantages. The truth is,
they were not only unprepared for a rupture with France,
but extremely unwilling to forego the commercial profits
which they derived from their neutrality.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, about this period, began to
harbour a &s;u&s;picion that certain other powers longed eager|ly
to enjoy the &s;ame re&s;pite from the dangers and inconve|niencies
of war, and that he ran the ri&s;que of being abandon|ed
by his &s;ole patron and ally, who &s;eemed greatly alarmed
at his defeat in Bohemia, and de&s;irous of detaching him&s;elf
from a connexion which might be productive of the mo&s;t di&s;|agreeable
con&s;equences to his continental intere&s;t. Stimulat|ed
by this opinion, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty is &s;aid to have writ|ten
an expo&s;tulatory letter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<P>The letter, which was written in French, we have tran&s;lated, for the reader's &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>&startq;I am informed that the de&s;ign of a treaty of neutrality for the electo|rate of H&mdash;r is not yet laid a&s;ide.

I hope your M&mdash;y will con&s;ider the &s;tep you have made me hazard, and rem|ber that you are the &s;ole cau&s;e of the&s;e misfortunes that now impend over my head.

I do not now repent of the treaty I have concluded with your M&mdash;y; but I expect you will not ingloriou&s;ly leave me at the mercy of my enemies, after having brought upon me all the force of Europe.

</LETTER></NOTE> to the K&mdash;of G&mdash;B&mdash;,
in which he very plainly taxes that monarch with having
<PB N="197" REF="199">
in&s;tigated him to commence ho&s;tilities; and in&s;i&s;ts upon
his remembering the engagements by which he was &s;o
&s;olemnly bound. From the &s;train of this letter, and the
Pru&s;&s;ian's declaration to the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter when he fir&s;t
&s;et out for Saxony, importing, that he was going to
fight the King of England's battles, a notion was gene|rally
conceived that tho&s;e two powers had agreed to
certain private pacta or conventions, the particulars
of which have not yet tran&s;pired. Certain it is, a decla|ration
was delivered to the Pru&s;&s;ian re&s;ident at London,
which appears to have been calculated as an an&s;wer to the
letter. In that paper the King of Great-Britain declared,
that the overtures made by his Maje&s;ty's electoral mini|&s;ters
in Germany, touching the checks received on the
continent, &s;hould have no influence on his Maje&s;ty as
king: that he &s;aw in the &s;ame light as before the per|nicious
effects of the union between the courts of Vienna
and Ver&s;ailles, threatening a &s;ubver&s;ion of the whole
&s;y&s;tem of publick liberty, and of the independence of the
European powers: that he con&s;idered as a fatal con&s;e|quence
of this dangerous connexion the ce&s;&s;ion made by
the court of Vienna of the ports in the Netherlands to
France, in &s;uch a critical &s;ituation, and contrary to the
faith of the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties: that whatever might
be the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms, his Maje&s;ty was determined to
act in con&s;tant concert with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia in em|ploying
the mo&s;t efficacious means to fru&s;trate the unju&s;t
and oppre&s;&s;ive de&s;igns of their common enemies. He con|cluded
with a&s;&s;uring the King of Pru&s;&s;ia that the Bri|ti&s;h
crown would continue to fulfil, with the greate&s;t
punctuality, its engagements with his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty,
and to &s;upport him with firmne&s;s and vigour. Such a
repre&s;entation could not &s;ail of being agreeable to a prince,
who, at this juncture, &s;tood in need of an extraordinary
cordial. He knew he could &s;ecurely depend not only
on the good faith of an Engli&s;h mini&s;try, but al&s;o on the
good plight of the Briti&s;h nation, which like an indulgent
nur&s;e hath always pre&s;ented the nipple to her meagre
<PB N="198" REF="200">
German allies. Tho&s;e, however, who pretended to con|&s;ider and canva&s;s events without prejudice and pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
could not help owning their &s;urpri&s;e, at hear|ing
an alliance &s;tigmati&s;ed as pernicious to the &s;y&s;tem of
public liberty, and &s;ubver&s;ive of the independence of the
European powers, as they remembered that this alliance
was the effect of nece&s;&s;ity, to which the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria
was reduced, for its own pre&s;ervation; reduced, as its
friends and parti&s;ans affirm, by tho&s;e very potentates, that
now reproached her with the&s;e connexions.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. His B&mdash;M&mdash;was re&s;olved that the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould have no cau&s;e to complain of his
indifference, whatever rea&s;ons he had to exclaim again&s;t
the convention of Clo&s;ter-Seven, which he did not &s;cruple
to condemn as a very &s;candalous capitulation, as much as
he di&s;approved of the conduct, in con&s;equence of which
near forty thou&s;and men were &s;o &s;hamefully di&s;armed,
and lo&s;t to his cau&s;e. Tho&s;e &s;tipulations al&s;o met with a
very unfavourable reception in England, where the
motions of the allied army in their retreat before the
enemy were very freely cen&s;ured, and &s;ome great names
expo&s;ed to the ridicule and contempt of the publick.
This event, &s;o &s;ingular in it&s;elf, and &s;o important in its
con&s;equences, attracted the attention of the privy-council,
where it is &s;aid to have been canva&s;&s;ed with great warmth
and animo&s;ity of altercation. The g&mdash;l complained
that he was re&s;tricted by peremptory orders from the re|gency
of H&mdash;; and they were reported to have u&s;ed
recriminations in their defence. In all probability, every
circum&s;tance of the di&s;pute was not explained to the &s;atis|faction
of all parties, ina&s;much as that great commander
quitted the harve&s;t of military glory, and, like another
Cincinnatus, retired to his plough. The convention of
Clo&s;ter-Seven was equally di&s;agreeable to the courts of
London and Ver&s;ailles. The former &s;aw the electorate of
Hanover left, by this capitulation, at the mercy of the
enemy, who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole country,
&s;ei&s;ed the revenues, exacted contributions, and changed
<PB N="199" REF="201">
the whole form of government, in the name of his Mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty: while the French army, which had
been employed in oppo&s;ing the Havoverians, was now at
liberty to throw their additional force into the &s;cale again&s;t
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who, at that period, &s;eemed to totter
on the verge of de&s;truction. On the other hand, the
French mini&s;try thought their general had granted too
favourable terms to a body of forces, whom he had
cooped up in &s;uch a manner, that, in a little time, they
mu&s;t have &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. They, therefore,
determined either to provoke the Hanoverians by ill-u&s;age
to an infraction of the treaty, or &s;hould that be
found impracticable, renounce it as an imperfect con|vention,
e&s;tabli&s;hed without proper authority. Both ex|pedients
were u&s;ed without re&s;erve. They were no &s;ooner
informed of the capitulation, than they refu&s;ed to ac|knowledge
its validity, except on condition that the
Hanoverian troops &s;hould formally engage to de&s;i&s;t from
all &s;ervice again&s;t France and her allies during the pre&s;ent
war, and be di&s;armed on their return to their own coun|try.
At the &s;ame time her general, who commanded in
the electorate, exhau&s;ted the country, by levying exorbi|tant
contributions, and connived at &s;uch outrages as de|graded
his own dignity, and reflected di&s;grace on the
character of his nation. The court of London, to make
a merit of nece&s;&s;ity, affected to con&s;ider the conventional
act as a provi&s;ional armi&s;tice, to pave the way for a ne|gociation
that might terminate in a general peace, and
propo&s;als were offered for that purpo&s;e: but the French
mini&s;try kept aloof, and &s;eemed re&s;olved that the electorate
of Hanover &s;hould be annexed to their king's dominions.
At lea&s;t, they were bent upon keeping it as a precious
depo&s;itum, which, in the plan of a general pacification,
they imagined, would counterbalance any advantage
that Great-Britain might obtain in other parts of the
world. Had they been allowed to keep this depo&s;it, the
kingdom of Great-Britain would have &s;aved about twenty
millions of money, together with the lives of her be&s;t
<PB N="200" REF="202">
&s;oldiers; and We&s;tphalia would have continued to enjoy
all the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ecurity and peace. But the King of
England's tenderne&s;s for Hanover was one of the chief
&s;ources of the misfortunes which befell that electo|rate.
He could not bear the thoughts of &s;eeing it, even
for a &s;ea&s;on, in the hands of the enemy; and his own
&s;entiments in this particular were re-enforced by the
pre&s;&s;ing remon&s;trances of the P&mdash;n monarch, whom, at
this juncture, he thought it dangerous to di&s;oblige. Actu|ated
by the&s;e motives, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ee the articles of
the convention &s;o palpably contravened, becau&s;e the vio|lation
unbound his hands, and enabled him, con&s;i&s;tently
with good faith, to take effectual &s;teps for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of his ally, and the recovery of his own dominions. He,
therefore, in quality of Elector of Brun&s;wick-Lunenbourg,
publi&s;hed a declaration, ob&s;erving, &ldquo;That his Royal High|ne&s;s
the Duke of Cumberland had, on his part, hone&s;tly
fulfilled all the conditions of the convention; but the
Duke de Richelieu demanded that the troops &s;hould enter
into an engagement &s;pecified above, and lay down their
arms; although it was expre&s;sly &s;tipulated in the con|vention
that they &s;hould not be regarded as pri&s;oners
of war, under which quality alone they could be di&s;|armed:
that the French court pretended to treat the
convention as a military regulation only; and, indeed,
it was originally nothing more: but as they had ex|pre&s;sly
di&s;owned its validity, and a negociation had
been actually begun for di&s;arming the auxiliaries, upon
certain conditions, though the French general would
never an&s;wer categorically, but waited always for fre&s;h
in&s;tructions from Ver&s;ailles, the nature of that act was
totally changed, and what was at fir&s;t an agreement be|tween
general and general was now become a matter of
&s;tate between the two courts of London and Ver&s;ailles:
that, however hard the conditions of the convention
appeared to be for the troops of Hanover, his Britannick
Maje&s;ty would have acquie&s;eed in them, had not the
French glaringly di&s;covered their de&s;ign of totally ruining
his army, and his dominions; and, by the mo&s;t outrageous
<PB N="201" REF="203">
conduct, freed his Britannick Maje&s;ty from every obli|gation
under which he had been laid by the convention:
that in the mid&s;t of the armi&s;tice the mo&s;t open ho&s;tili|ties
had been committed: the ca&s;te of Schartzfeis had
been forcibly &s;ei&s;ed and pillaged, and the garri&s;on made
pri&s;oners of war: the pri&s;oners made by the French before
the convention had not been re&s;tored, according to an
expre&s;s article &s;tipulated between the generals, though it
had been fulfilled on the part of the electorate, by the im|mediate
relea&s;e of the French pri&s;oners; the bailies of tho&s;e
di&s;tricts from which the French troops were excluded by
mutual agreement had been &s;ummoned, on pain of mili|tary
execution, to appear before the French commi&s;&s;ary,
and compelled to deliver into his hands the publick reve|nue:
the French had appropriated to them&s;elves part of
tho&s;e magazines which, by expre&s;s agreement, were
de&s;tined for the u&s;e of the electoral troops; and they had
&s;ei&s;ed the hou&s;es, revenue, and corn belonging to the
King of England in the city of Bremen, in violation of
their engagement to con&s;ider that city as a place ab&s;olutely
free and neutral. He took notice that they had proceeded
to menaces unheard of among civili&s;ed people, of burning,
&s;acking, and de&s;troying every thing that fell in their way,
&s;hould the lea&s;t he&s;itation be made in executing the con|vention
according to their interpretation.&rdquo;&mdash;Such were the
profe&s;&s;ed con&s;iderations that determined his Britannick
Maje&s;ty to renounce the agreement which they had vio|lated,
and have recour&s;e to arms for the relief of his &s;ub|jects
and allies. It was in con&s;equence of this determi|nation
that he conferred the command of his electoral
army on Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick, brother to the
duke of that name, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the
Pru&s;&s;ian army by his great military talents, and was, by
blood and inclination, as well as intere&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ed warmly
attached to his Britannick Maje&s;ty. The truth is, the
K&mdash;g of P&mdash;a recommended him to this command,
becau&s;e he knew he could depend upon his concurring
with all his mea&s;ures, in conducting the operations of the
<PB N="202" REF="204">
Briti&s;h army. The Duke de Richelieu was no &s;ooner in|formed
of the&s;e particulars, than he &s;ent a letter to Prince
Ferdinand, &s;pecifying, &ldquo;That although for &s;ome days he
had perceived the Hanoverian troops in motion, in order to
form them&s;elves into a body, he could not imagine the
object of the&s;e movements was to infringe the convention
of neutrality which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed between the Duke
of Cumberland and him&s;elf, as French general; that he
was blinded &s;o far by his confidence in the good faith of
the Elector of Hanover, who had &s;igned that convention,
as to believe the troops were a&s;&s;embled for no other purpo&s;e
than to be di&s;tributed into winter-quarters, which had been
a&s;&s;igned them by the agreement; but his eyes were at la&s;t
opened, by repea$ed advices, which he had received from
all quarters, importing, that the Hanoverians intended
to infringe tho&s;e articles which ought to be &s;acred and in|violable:
he affirmed, the King his ma&s;ter was &s;till willing
to give fre&s;h proofs of his moderation, and his de&s;ire to
&s;pare the effu&s;ion of human blood: with that view he de|clared
to his Serene Highne&s;s, in the name of his Mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, that he per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution of
fulfilling exactly all the points of the convention, pro|vided
they &s;hould be equally ob&s;erved by the Hanoverian
army; but he could not help appri&s;ing his Serene Highne&s;s
that if his army &s;hould take any equivocal &s;tep, and, &s;till
more, &s;hould it commit any act of ho&s;tility, he would
then pu&s;h matters to the la&s;t extremity, looking upon
him&s;elf as authori&s;ed &s;o to do by the rules of war: that
he would &s;et fire to all the palaces, hou&s;es, and gardens;
&s;ack all the towns and villages, without &s;paring the mo&s;t
incon&s;iderable cottage, and &s;ubject the country to all the
horrors of war and deve&s;tation. He conjured his Serene
Highne&s;s to reflect on the&s;e particulars, and begged he
would not lay him under the nece&s;&s;ity of taking &s;teps &s;o
contrary to his own per&s;onal character, as well as to the
natural humanity of the French nation.&rdquo; To this letter,
which was &s;econded by the Count de Lynar, the Dani&s;h
amba&s;&s;ador, who had meditated the convention, Prince
<PB N="203" REF="205">
Ferdinand returned a very laconick an&s;wer, intimating,
that he would give the Duke de Richelieu his an&s;wer in
per&s;on at the head of his army. At this particular junc|ture,
the French general was di&s;po&s;ed to abide by the
original articles of the convention, rather than draw up|on
him&s;elf the ho&s;tilities of an army which he knew to
be brave, re&s;olute, and well appointed, and which he &s;aw
at pre&s;ent animated with an eager de&s;ire of wiping out the
di&s;grace they had &s;u&s;tained by the capitulation, as well as
of relieving their country from the grievous oppre&s;&s;ion
under which it groaned.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. About the latter end of November the Hano|verian
army was wholly a&s;&s;embled at Stade, under the
au&s;pices of Prince Ferdinand, who re&s;olved, without de|lay,
to drive the French from the electorate, whither
they now began their march. Part of the enemy's rear,
con&s;i&s;ting of two thou&s;and men, was, in their march back
to Zell, attacked in the bailiwick of Eb&s;torff, and entirely
defeated by General Schuylenbourg; and, in a few
days after this action, another happened upon the river
Aller, between two con&s;iderable bodies of each army, in
which the Hanoverians, commanded by General Za&s;trow,
remained ma&s;ters of the field. The&s;e petry advantages
&s;erved to encourage the allies, and put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Lunenbourg, Zell, and part of the Brun&s;wick do|minions,
which the enemy were obliged to abandon.
The operations of Prince Ferdinand, however, were re|tarded
by the re&s;olution and ob&s;tinate per&s;everance of the
French officer who commanded the garri&s;on of Harbourg.
When the Hanoverian troops made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of
the town, he retired into the ca&s;tle, which he held out
again&s;t a con&s;iderable detachment of the allied army, by
whom it was inve&s;ted; at length, however, the &s;ortifi|cations
being entirely demoli&s;hed, he &s;urrendered upon
capitulation. On the &s;ixth day of December Prince Ferdi|$and
began his march towards Zell, where the French
army had taken po&s;t, under the command of the Duke de
Ricelieu, who, at the approach of the Hanoverians,
<PB N="204" REF="206">
called in his advanced parties, abandoned &s;everal maga|zines,
burned all the farm-hou&s;es and buildings belonging
to the &s;heep walks of his Britannick Maje&s;ty, without pay|ing
the lea&s;t regard to the repre&s;entations made by Prince
Ferdinand on this &s;ubject; reduced the &s;uburbs of Zell
to a&s;hes, after having allowed his men to plunder the
hou&s;es, and even &s;et fire to the Orphan-ho&s;pital, in which
a great number of helple&s;s children are &s;aid to have peri$$|ed.
One cannot, without horrour, reflect upon &s;uch brutal
acts of inhumanity. The French troops on divers occa|&s;ions,
and in different parts of the empire, acted tragedies
of the &s;ame nature, which are not ea&s;ily reconcileable to
the character of a nation famed for &s;entiment and $word$.
The Hanoverians having advanced within a league of
Zell, the two armies began to cannonade each other; the
French troops po&s;ted on the right of the Aller burned
their magazines, and retired into the town, where they
were &s;o &s;trongly entrenched, that Prince Ferdinand could
not attempt the river, the pa&s;&s;es of which were &s;trongly
guarded by the enemy. At the &s;ame time, his troops
were expo&s;ed to great hard&s;hips from the &s;everity of the
weather; he, therefore, retreated to Ultzen and Lunen|bourg,
where his army was put into winter-quarters, and
executed &s;everal &s;mall enterpri&s;es by detachment, while
the French general fixed his head-quarters in the city of
Hanover, his cantonments extending as far as Zell, in the
neighbourhood of which many &s;harp &s;kirmi&s;hes were
&s;ought from the out-parties with various &s;ucce&s;s. Their Im|perial
Maje&s;ties were no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of the&s;e tran&s;ac|tions,
which they con&s;idered as infractions of the conven|tion,
than they &s;ent an intimation to the Baron de Stein|berg,
mini&s;ter from the King of Great-Britain as Elector of
Hanover, that he &s;hould appear no more at court, or con|fer
with their mini&s;ters; and that his re&s;iding at Vienna,
as he might ea&s;ily conceive, could not be very agreeable:
in con&s;equence of which me&s;&s;age he retired, after having
obtained the nece&s;&s;ary pa&s;&s;ports for his departure. The
chagrin occa&s;ioned at the court of Vienna by the Hano|verian
<PB N="205" REF="207">
army's having recour&s;e to their arms again was, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, alleviated by the certain tidings received
from Peter&s;burgh, that the Czarina had &s;igned her acce&s;|&s;ion
in form to the treaty between the courts of Vienna,
Ver&s;ailles, and Stockholm.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. In clo&s;ing our account of this year's
tran&s;actions on the continent, we may ob&s;erve, that on
the &s;ixteenth day of November the Queen of Poland died
at Berlin of an apoplexy, &s;uppo&s;ed to be occa&s;ioned by
the &s;hock &s;he received on hearing that the French were
totally defeated at Ro&s;bach. She was a lady of exemplary
virtue and piety, who&s;e con&s;titution had been broke by
grief and anxiety conceived from the di&s;tre&s;s of her own
family, as well as from the mi&s;ery to which &s;he &s;aw her
people expo&s;ed. With re&s;pect to the European powers
that were not actually engaged as principals in the war,
they &s;eemed indu&s;triou&s;ly to avoid every &s;tep that might
be con&s;trued a deviation from the mo&s;t &s;crupulous neutra|lity.
The States-General proceeded with great circum|&s;pection,
in the middle cour&s;e between two powerful
neighbours, equally jealous and formidable; and the King
of Spain was gratified for his forbearance with a convention
&s;ettled between him and the belligerent powers, imply|ing,
that his &s;ubjects &s;hould pur&s;ue their commerce at
&s;ea without mole&s;tation, provided they &s;hould not tran&s;|port
tho&s;e articles of merchandi&s;e which were deemed
contraband by all nations.&mdash;The operations at &s;ea,
during the cour&s;e of this year, either in Europe or Ame|rica,
were far from being deci&s;ive or important. The
commerce of Great-Britain &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage
from the activity and &s;ucce&s;s of French privateers, of
which a great number had been equipped in the i&s;lands
of Martinique and Guadaloupe. The Greenwich &s;hip of
war, mounted with fifty guns, and a &s;rigate of twenty,
fell into the hands of the enemy, together with a very
con&s;iderable number of trading ve&s;&s;els. On the other
hand, the Engli&s;h crui&s;ers and privateers acquirted them|&s;elves
with equal vigilance and valour. The Due d'Ac|uitaine,
a large &s;hip of fifty guns, was taken in the
<PB N="206" REF="208">
month of June by two Briti&s;h &s;hips of war, after a &s;evere
engagement; and, about the &s;ame time, the Aquilon, of
nearly the &s;ame force, was driven on &s;hore and de&s;troyed
near Bre&s;t by the Antelope, one of the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers.
A French frigate of twenty-&s;ix guns, called the Emeraude,
was taken in the channel, after a warm engagement, by
an Engli&s;h &s;hip of inferior force, under the command of
Captain Gilchri&s;t, a gallant and alert officer, who, in the
&s;equel, &s;ignali&s;ed him&s;elf on divers occa&s;&s;ions, by very ex|traordinary
acts of valour. All the &s;ea-officers &s;eemed to
be animated with a noble emulation to di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves
in the &s;ervice of their country, and the &s;pirit de|&s;$ended
even to the captains of privateers, who, in&s;tead of
imitating the former commanders of that cla&s;s, in avoid|ing
&s;hips of force, and centering their whole attention in
advantageous prizes, now encountered the armed &s;hips of
the enemy, and fought with the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate valour in
the pur&s;uit of national glory.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. Perhaps hi&s;tory cannot afford a more re|markable
in&s;tance of de&s;perate courage than that which
was exerted in December of the preceding year, by the
officers and crew of an Engli&s;h privateer, called the Ter|rible,
under the command of Captain William Death,
equipped with twenty-&s;ix carriage-guns, and manned
with two hundred &s;ailors. On the twenty-third day of
the month he engaged and made prize of a large French
&s;hip from St. Domingo, after an ob&s;tinate battle, in which
he lo&s;t his own brother and &s;ixteen &s;eamen: then he
&s;ecured with $orty men his prize, which contained a
valuable cargo, and directed his cour&s;e to England, but in
a few days he had the misfortune to fall in with the Ven|geance,
a privateer of St. Malos, carrying thirty-&s;ix large
cannon, with a complement of three hundred and &s;ixty
men. Their fir&s;t &s;tep was to attack the prize, which
was ea&s;ily re-taken; then the two &s;hips bore down upon
the Terrible, who&s;e main-ma&s;t was &s;hot away by the fir&s;t
broad&s;ide. Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;a&s;ter, the Terrible
maintained &s;uch a $urious engagement again&s;t both $word$
can hardly be parallelled in the annals of Britain. The
<PB N="207" REF="209">
French commander and his &s;econd were killed, with two
thirds of his company; but the gallant Captain Death,
with the greater part of his officers, and almo&s;t his whole
crew, having met with the &s;ame fate, his &s;hip was boarded
by the enemy, who found no more than twenty-&s;ix per|&s;ons
alive, &s;ixteen of whom were mutilated by the lo&s;s of
leg or arm, and the other ten grievou&s;ly wounded. The
&s;hip it&s;elf was &s;o &s;hattered, that it could &s;carce be kept
above water, and the whole exhibited a &s;cene of blood,
horrour, and de&s;olation. The victor it&s;elf lay like a wreck
on the &s;urface; and in this condition made &s;hift, with
great difficulty, to tow the Terrible<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There was a &s;trange combination of names belonging to this privateer, $ Terrible, equipped at Execution-Dock, commanded by Captain Death, $$o&s;e lieutenant was called Devil, and who had one Gho&s;t for $urgeon.</NOTE> into St. Malos,
where &s;he was not beheld without a&s;toni&s;hment and ter|rour.
This adventure was no &s;ooner known in England,
than a liberal &s;ub&s;cription was rai&s;ed for the &s;upport of
Death's widow, and that part of the crew which &s;urvived
the engagement. In this, and every &s;ea-rencounter that
happened within the pre&s;ent year, the &s;uperiority in &s;kill
and re&s;olution was a&s;certained to the Briti&s;h mariners; for
even when they fought again&s;t great odds, their courage
was generally crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. In the month of
November, Captain Lockhart, a young gentleman, who
had already rendered him&s;elf a terrour to the enemy as
commander of a &s;mall frigate, now added con&s;iderably to
his reputation, by reducing the Melampe, a French priva|teer,
of Bayonne, greatly &s;uperior to his own &s;hip in num|ber
of men and weight of metal. This exploit was &s;e|$onded
by another of the &s;ame nature, in his conque&s;t of
another French adventurer, called the Coun$e&s;s of Gra|$nont;
and a third large privateer of Bayonne was taken
by Captain Saumarez, commander of the Antelope. In $word$
word, the narrow &s;eas were &s;o well guarded, that in a
little time &s;carce a French &s;hip dur&s;t appear in the Engli&s;h
channel, which the Briti&s;h traders navigated without
$ole&s;tation.</P>

&sect; XXIX. On the fir&s;t day of December, the King of
Great-Britain opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament with a
&s;peech from the throne, which &s;eemed calculated to pre|pare
the nation for the expen&s;e of maintaining a new war
on the continent of Europe. His Maje&s;ty graciou&s;ly
declared, that it would have given him a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible
plea&s;ure to acquaint them, at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion,
that his &s;ucce&s;s in carrying on the war had been equal to
the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, and the extent and vigour of the
mea&s;ures formed for that purpo&s;e. He expre&s;&s;ed the firme&s;t
confidence, that the &s;pirit and bravery of the nation, &s;o
renowned in all times, which had formerly &s;urmounted
&s;o many difficulties, were not to be abated by a few di&s;|appointments,
which, he tru&s;ted, might be retrieved by
the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and the zeal and ardour of his par|liament
for his Maje&s;ty's honour and the advantage of
their country. He &s;aid it was his determined re&s;olution to
apply his utmo&s;t efforts for the &s;ecurity of his kingdoms,
and for the recovery and protection of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and
rights of his crown and &s;ubjects in America, and el&s;ewhere,
as well by the &s;tronge&s;t exertion of his naval force, as by
all other methods. He &s;ignified, that another great object
which he had at heart, was the pre&s;ervation of the pro|te&s;tant
religion, and the liberties of Europe; and, in that
view, to encourage and adhere to his allies. For this cau&s;e,
he a&s;&s;ured them, he would decline no inconveniencies, and
in this cau&s;e he earne&s;tly &s;ollicited their hearty concur|rence
and vigorous a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He ob&s;erved, that the late
&s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s in Germany had given a happy turn to
affairs, which it was incumbent on them to improve;
and that, in &s;uch a critical conjuncture, the eyes of all
Europe were upon them. He particularly recommended
to them, that his good brother and ally the King of Pru&s;&s;ia
might be &s;upported in &s;uch a manner as his magnanimity
and active zeal for the common cau&s;e appeared to de&s;erve.
To the Commons he expre&s;&s;ed his concern that the large
&s;upplies they had already granted did not produce all the

reliance on their wi&s;dom, as not to doubt of their per&s;e|verance.
He only de&s;ired &s;uch &s;upplies as &s;hould be
nece&s;&s;ary for the publick &s;ervice, and told them they might
depend upon it, that the be&s;t and mo&s;t faithful oeconomy
&s;hould be u&s;ed. He took notice of that &s;pirit of di&s;order
which had &s;hown it&s;elf among the common people in
&s;ome parts of the kingdom he laid injunctions upon them
to u&s;e their endeavours for di&s;couraging and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing
&s;uch abu&s;es, and for maintaining the laws and lawful
authority. He concluded with ob&s;erving, that nothing
would &s;o effectually conduce to the defense of all that was
dear to the nation, as well as to the reducing their enemies
to rea&s;on, as union and harmony among them&s;elves. The
time was when every paragraph of this harangue, which
the reader will perceive is not remarkable for its elegance
and propriety, would have been canva&s;&s;ed and impugned
by the country party in the Hou&s;e of Commons. They
would have imputed the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the war to the indi&s;|cretion
of the mini&s;try, in taking prepo&s;terous mea&s;ures,
and appointing commanders unequal to the &s;ervice&punc; They
would have enquired in what manner the prote&s;tant re|ligion
was endangered; and, if it was, how it could be
pre&s;erved or promoted by adhering to allies, who, without
provocation, had well nigh ruined the fir&s;t and principal
prote&s;tant country of the Empire. They would have
&s;tarted doubts with re&s;pect to the late &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s in
Germany, and hinted, that it would only &s;erve to pro|tract
the burthen of a continental war. They would have
owned that the eyes of all Europe were upon them, and
drawn this con&s;equence, that it therefore behoved them to
act with the more delicacy and caution in di&s;charge of the
&s;acred tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by their con&s;tituents: a tru&s;t
which their con&s;ciences would not allow to be faithfully
di&s;charged, &s;hould they ru&s;h precipitately into the de|&s;tructive
mea&s;ures of a ra&s;h and prodigal mini&s;try, &s;quander
away the wealth of the nation, and add to the grievous
incumbrances under which it groaned, in &s;upport of con|nexions
and alliances that were equally foreign to her
con&s;ideration, and pernicious to her intere&s;t. They would
<PB N="209" REF="213">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="210" REF="214">
have inve&s;tigated that cau&s;e which was &s;o warmly recom|mended
for &s;upport, and pretended to di&s;cover that it was a
cau&s;e in which Great-Britain ought to have had no con|cern,
becau&s;e it produced a certainty of lo&s;s without the
lea&s;t pro&s;pect of advantage. They would have varied
e&s;&s;entially in their opinions of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, from
the &s;entiments of tho&s;e who prepared the e&s;timates, and
even declared &s;ome doubts about the oeconomy to be u&s;ed
in managing the national expen&s;e; finally, they would
have repre&s;ented the impo&s;&s;ibility of union between the two
parties, one of which &s;eemed bent upon reducing the other
to beggary and contempt. Such was the &s;train that u&s;ed
to flow from an oppo&s;ition, &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of di&s;loyalty and
di&s;appointed ambition. But that malignant &s;pirit was now
happily extingui&s;hed. The voice of the &s;overeign was ador|ed
as the oracle of a divinity, and tho&s;e happy days were now
approaching that &s;aw the Commons of England pour their
trea&s;ures, in &s;upport of a German prince, with &s;uch a ge|nerous
hand, that po&s;terity will be amazed at their liberality.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. To the &s;peech of his Maje&s;ty the Hou&s;e of
Lords returned an addre&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1758.</NOTE> in &s;uch terms of complacency
as had long di&s;tingui&s;hed that illu&s;trious a&s;&s;embly. The
Commons expre&s;&s;ed their approbation and confidence with
equal ardour, and not one objection was made to the form
or nature of the addre&s;s, though one gentleman, equally
independent in his mind and fortune, took exceptions to
&s;ome of the mea&s;ures which had been lately pur&s;ued.
Their complai&s;ance was more &s;ub&s;tantially &s;pecified in the
re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e, as &s;oon as the two great com|mittees
of &s;upply were appointed. They granted for the
&s;ea &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year &s;ixty thou&s;and men, in|cluding
fourteen thou&s;and eight hundred and forty-five
marines, and the &s;tanding army, comprehending four
thou&s;and invalids, was fixed at fifty-three thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and &s;eventy-&s;even effective men, commi&s;&s;ion and
non-commi&s;&s;ion officers included. For the maintenance
of the&s;e forces, by &s;ea and land, the charge of guards and
garri&s;ons at home and abroad, the expen&s;e of the Ordnance,
and in order to make good the &s;um which had been i&s;&s;ued
<PB N="211" REF="215">
by his Maje&s;ty's orders, in pur&s;uance of the addre&s;s from
the Commons, they now allotted four millions, twenty-two
thou&s;and, eight hundred and &s;even pounds, &s;even
&s;hillings, and three-pence. They unanimou&s;ly granted,
as a pre&s;ent &s;upply in the then critical exigency, towards
enabling his Maje&s;ty to maintain and keep together the
army formed la&s;t year in his electoral dominions, and then
again put in motion, and actually employed again&s;t the
common enemy, in concert with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia,
the &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and pounds: for the ordinary
of the navy, including half pay to the &s;ea officers, they
allowed two hundred twenty-four thou&s;and, four hundred
twenty-one pounds, five &s;hillings, and eight-pence: to|wards
the building and &s;upport of the three ho&s;pitals for
&s;eamen at Go&s;port, Plymouth, and Greenwich thirty
thou&s;and pounds: for the reduced officers of the land|forces
and marines, pen&s;ions to the widows of officers, and
other &s;uch military contingencies, forty thou&s;and nine
hundred and twenty-&s;ix pounds, &s;eventeen &s;hillings, and
eleven-pence: towards building, re-building, and repairs
of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips for the en&s;uing year, the sum of two
hundred thou&s;and pounds: for defraying the charge of
two thou&s;and one hundred and twenty hor&s;e, and nine
thou&s;and nine hundred infantry, together with the general
and &s;taff officers, the officers of the ho&s;pital and the train
of artillery, being the troops of the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el
in the pay of Great-Britain, for &s;ixty days, together
with the &s;ub&s;idy for the &s;aid time, pur&s;uant to treaty,
they a&s;&s;igned thirty-eight thou&s;and three hundred and &s;ixty
pounds, nineteen &s;hillings, and ten-pence three farthings.
To the Foundling-ho&s;pital they gave forty thou&s;and
pounds, for the maintenance and education of de&s;erted
young children, as well as for the reception of all &s;uch as
&s;hould be pre&s;ented under a certain age, to be limited by
the governors and guardians of that charity. Three hun|dred
thou&s;and pounds were given towards di&s;charging the
debt of the navy, and two hundred eighty-four thou&s;and
eight hundred and two pounds for making up the deficiency
<PB N="212" REF="216">
of the grants for the &s;ervice of the preceding year. The
Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el was, moreover, gratified with
the further &s;um of two hundred and three thou&s;and five
hundred and thirty-&s;ix pounds, four &s;hillings, and nine|pence
farthing, for the maintenance of his forces, and the
remainder of his &s;ub&s;idy. They granted &s;ix hundred and
&s;eventy thou&s;and pounds for enabling his Maje&s;ty to make
good his engagements with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, pur&s;uant
to a convention lately concluded with that potentate.
For defraying the charge of thirty-eight thou&s;and men of
the troops of Hanover, Wolfenbuttel, Saxe-Gotha, and
the Count of Buckbourg, together with that of general
and &s;taff-officers actually employed again&s;t the common
enemy, in concert with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, from the
twenty-eighth day of November in the la&s;t, to the twenty-fourth
of December in the pre&s;ent year inclu&s;ive, to be
i&s;&s;ued in advance every two months, they allotted the &s;um
of four hundred and &s;ixty-three thou&s;and eighty-four
pounds, &s;ix &s;hillings, and ten-pence; and furthermore
they granted three hundred eighty-&s;ix thou&s;and, nine
hundred and fifteen pounds, thirteen &s;hillings, and two-pence,
to defray the charges of forage, bread-waggons,
train of artillery, provi&s;ions, wood, &s;traw, and all other
extraordinary expen&s;es, contingencies, and lo&s;&s;es what|&s;oever,
incurred, or to be incurred, on account of
his Maje&s;ty's army, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty-eight thou&s;and
men, actually employed again&s;t the common enemy,
in concert with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, from November
la&s;t to next December inclu&s;ive. For the extraordi|nary
expen&s;es of the land-forces, and other &s;ervices, in|curred
in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year, and not provided for
by parliament, they allowed one hundred forty-five thou|&s;and,
four hundred fifty-four pounds, fifteen &s;hillings, and
one farthing. They provided eight hundred thou&s;and
pounds to enable his Maje&s;ty to defray the like &s;um rai&s;ed
in pur&s;uance of an act made in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament,
and charged upon the fir&s;t aids and &s;upplies to be granted
in the current &s;e&s;&s;ion. Twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and pounds were
<PB N="213" REF="217">
be&s;towed on the out-pen&s;ioners of Chel&s;ea-ho&s;pital; above
twenty thou&s;and for the expen&s;e of maintaining the colo|nies
of Nova-Scotia and Georgia; for reimbur&s;ing to the
province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's-Bay, and the colony of Con|necticut,
their expen&s;e in furni&s;hing provi&s;ions and &s;tores
to the troops rai&s;ed by them, for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, in
the campaign of the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and
fifty-&s;ix, the &s;um of forty-one thou&s;and, one hundred,
&s;eventeen pounds, &s;eventeen &s;hillings, and &s;ix-pence half-penny;
to be applied towards the re$ building of London-bridge,
carrying on the works for fortifying and &s;ecuring
the harbour of Milford, and repairing the pari&s;h-church of
St. Margaret, in We&s;tmin&s;ter, they allotted twenty-nine
thou&s;and pounds. The Ea&s;t-India company were in|dulged
with twenty thou&s;and pounds upon account, to|wards
enabling them to defray the expen&s;e of a military
force in their &s;ettlements, to be maintained by them in
lieu of the battalion of his Maje&s;ty's $orces withdrawn
from tho&s;e &s;ettlements: the &s;um of ten thou&s;and pounds
was given, as u&s;ual, for maintaining and &s;upporting the
Briti&s;h forts and &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Africa; and
eleven thou&s;and four hundred and fifty were granted as an
augmentation to the &s;alaries of the judges in the &s;uperior
courts of judicature. They likewi&s;e provided one hundred
thou&s;and pounds for defraying the charge of pay and cloth|ing
to the militia, and advanced eight hundred thou&s;and
pounds, to enable his Maje&s;ty to de&s;ray any extraordinary
expen&s;es of the war, incurred or to be incurred for the
&s;ervice of the current year; and to take all &s;uch mea&s;ures
as might be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;appoint or defeat any enter|pri&s;es
or de&s;igns of his enemies, as the exigency of his
affairs might require. The whole &s;upplies of this &s;e&s;&s;ion
amounted to the enormous &s;um of ten millions, four hun|dred
eighty-&s;ix thou&s;and, four hundred fifty-&s;even pounds,
and one penny. Nothing could &s;o plainly demon&s;trate
the implicit confidence which the parliament, at this
juncture, repo&s;ed in the &s;overeign and the mini&s;try, as
their conduct in granting &s;uch liberal &s;upplies, great part
<PB N="214" REF="218">
of which were be&s;towed in favour of our German allies,
whom the Briti&s;h nation thus generou&s;ly paid for fight|ing
their own battles. Be&s;ides the &s;um of one million,
eight hundred &s;ixty-one thou&s;and, eight hundred ninety-&s;even
pounds, four &s;hillings, and eight-pence, expre&s;$ly
a&s;&s;igned for the &s;upport of the&s;e continental connexions,
a &s;um con&s;iderably exceeding the whole of the revenue
rai&s;ed in the reign of Charles the Second, and what part of
the &s;um granted to the King for extraordinary expen&s;es
might be applied to the &s;ame u&s;e, the article might not
improperly be &s;welled with the va&s;t expen&s;e incurred by
expeditions to the coa&s;t of France, the chief, if not &s;ole
de&s;ign of which &s;eemed to be a diver&s;ion in favour of the
nation's allies in Germany, by preventing France from
&s;ending &s;uch numerous armies into that country as it
could have &s;pared, had not its &s;ea-coa&s;ts required a con&s;i|derable
body of forces for its defen&s;e again&s;t the attempts
of the Engli&s;h. Indeed, the partians of the mini&s;try were
at great pains to &s;ugge&s;t and inculcate a belief, that the war
in Germany was chiefly &s;upported as a nece&s;&s;ary divernon
in favour of Great-Britain and her plantations, which
would have been expo&s;ed to in&s;ult and inva&s;ion, had not
the enemy's forces been otherwi&s;e employed. But the
ab&s;urdity of this notion will at once appear to tho&s;e who
con&s;ider, that by this time Great-Britain was &s;ole $word$
of the &s;ea; that the navy of France was almo&s;t r$ined,
and her commerce on the ocean quite extingui&s;hed; that
&s;he could not, with the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, hazard
any expedition of con&s;equence again&s;t Great-Britain, or
any part of her dominions, while the ocean was covered
with &s;uch powerful navies belonging to that nation; and
that if one third part of the money annually $span$
the German vortex, had been employed in $word$
the naval forces of England, and tho&s;e forces properly ex|erted,
not a &s;ingle crui&s;er would have been able to $span$
the harbours of France; all her colonies in the We&s;t-Indies
would have fallen an ea&s;y prey to the arms of Great-Britain;
and thus cut off from the re&s;ources of comme$ce,

&s;he mu&s;t have been content to embrace &s;uch terms of peace
as the victor &s;hould have thought proper to pre&s;cribe.</P>

his Maje&s;ty, communicated to the Hou&s;e by Mr. Secre|tary
Pitt, &s;ignifying, That the King had ordered his
electoral army to be put again in motion, that it might act
with vigour again&s;t the common enemy, in concert with
his good brother and ally, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia; that the
exhau&s;ted and ruined &s;tate of the electorate having ren|dered
it incapable of maintaining that army, until the fur|ther
nece&s;&s;ary charge thereof, as well as the more particu|lar
mea&s;ures then concerting for the effectual &s;upport of
his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, could be laid before the Hou&s;e, the
King, relying on the con&s;tant zeal of his faithful Com|mons
for the &s;upport of the prote&s;tant religion, and of the
liberties of Europe again&s;t the dangerous de&s;igns of France
and her confederates, found him&s;elf, in the mean time,
under the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of recommending to the Hou&s;e
the &s;peedy con&s;ideration of &s;uch a pre&s;ent &s;upply as might
enable his Maje&s;ty, in this critical conjuncture, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t
and keep together the &s;aid army. This addre&s;s was no
&s;ooner recited by the Speaker, than it was unanimou&s;ly
referred to the committee of &s;upply, who gratified his Ma|je&s;ty's
wi&s;h with an immediate re&s;olution; and, con&s;i|dering
their generous di&s;po&s;ition, doubtle&s;s the &s;ame com|pliance
<PB N="218" REF="222">
would have appeared, even though no mention had
been made of the prote&s;tant religion, which, to men of
ordinary penetration, appeared to have no natural concern
in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute between the belligerent powers,
although former mini&s;ters had often violently introduced
it into me&s;&s;ages and &s;peeches from the throne, in order to
dazzle the eyes of the populace, even while they in&s;ulted
the under&s;tanding of tho&s;e who were capable of exerci&s;ing
their own rea&s;on. This pretext was worn &s;o threadbare, that,
among the &s;en&s;ible part of mankind, it could no longer be
u&s;ed without incurring contempt and ridicule. In order
to per&s;uade mankind that the prote&s;tant religion was in
danger, it would have been nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pecify the de|&s;igns
that were formed again&s;t it, as well as the nature of
the con&s;piracy, and to de&s;cend to particulars, properly au|thenticated.
In that ca&s;e, great part of Europe would
have been ju&s;tly alarmed. The States-General of the
United-Provinces, who have made &s;uch glorious and inde|fatigable
efforts in &s;upport of the prote&s;tant religion, would
&s;urely have lent an helping hand towards its pre&s;ervation.
The Danes would not have &s;tood tamely neutral, and &s;een
the religion they profe&s;s expo&s;ed to the rage of &s;uch a pow|erful
confederacy. It is not to be imagined that the
Swedes, who have &s;o zealou&s;ly maintained the purity of the
Prote&s;tant faith, would now join an a&s;&s;ociation who&s;e aim
was the ruin of that religion. It is not credible that even
the Hungarians, who pro&s;e&s;s the &s;ame faith, and other
prote&s;tant &s;tates of the Empire, would enter &s;o heartily
into the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e who were bent upon its de|&s;truction;
or that the Ru&s;&s;ians would contribute to the
aggrandi&s;ement of the catholick faith and di&s;cipline, &s;o
oppo&s;ite to that of the Greek church, which they e&s;pou&s;e.
As, therefore, no particular of &s;uch a de&s;ign was ex|plained,
no act of oppre&s;&s;ion towards any prote&s;tant &s;tate or
&s;ociety pointed out, except tho&s;e that were excerci&s;ed by
the prote&s;tants them&s;elves; and as the court of Vienna
repeatedly di&s;avowed any &s;uch de&s;ign, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn
manner, the unprejudiced part of mankind will be apt to
<PB N="219" REF="223">
conclude that the cry of religion was u&s;ed, as in former
times, to arou&s;e, alarm, and inflame; nor did the artifice
prove altogether un&s;ucce&s;sful. Notwith&s;tanding the
general luke-warmth of the age in matters of religion, it
produced con&s;iderable effect among the fanatick &s;ectaries
that &s;warm through the kingdom of England. The
leaders of tho&s;e blind enthu&s;ia&s;ts, either actuated by the
&s;pirit of delu&s;ion, or de&s;irous of recommending them&s;elves
to the protection of the higher powers, immediately &s;ei&s;ed
the hint, expatiating vehemently on the danger that im|pended
over God's people; and exerting all their faculties
to impre&s;s the belief of a religious war, which never fails
to exa&s;perate and impel the minds of men to &s;uch deeds of
cruelty and revenge as mu&s;t di&s;credit all religion, and even
di&s;grace humanity. The &s;ignal tru&s;t and confidence which
the parliament of England repo&s;ed in the King, at this
juncture, was in nothing more con&s;picuous than in leaving
to the crown the unlimited application of the &s;um granted
for augmenting the &s;alaries of the judges. In the reign of
King William, when the act of &s;ettlement was pa&s;&s;ed, the
parliament, jealous of the influence which the crown might
acquire over the judges, provided, by an expre&s;s clau&s;e of
that act, that the commi&s;&s;ions of the judges &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t
<HI>quam diu &s;e bene g$&s;&s;erint,</HI> and that their &s;alaries &s;hould be
e&s;tabli&s;hed: but now we find a &s;um of money granted for
the augmentation of their &s;alaries, and the crown ve&s;ted
with a di&s;cretionary power to proportion and apply this
aug mentation: a &s;tretch of complai&s;ance, which, how
&s;afe &s;oeve: it may appear during the reign of a prince famed
for integrity and moderation, will perhaps one day be con|&s;idered
as a very dangerous acce&s;&s;ion to the prerogative.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. So fully per&s;uaded were the mini&s;try that
the Commons would chearfully enable them to pay what
&s;ub&s;idies they might promi&s;e to their German allies, that
on the eleventh of April they concluded a new treaty or
convention with his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, which, that it might
have the firmer con&s;i&s;tence, and the greater authority, was,
on the part of Great Britain, tran&s;acted and &s;igned by
<PB N="220" REF="224">
almo&s;t all the privy-coun&s;ellors who had any &s;hare in the
admini&s;tration<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were, Sir Robert Henley, lord keeper of the great &s;eal; John Earl of Granville, pre&s;ident of the council; Thomas Holles Duke of New|ca&s;tle, fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury; Robert Earl of Holderne&s;&s;e, one of the principal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate; Philip Earl of Hardwicke; and William Pitt, E&s;q. another of the principal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate. In the name and on the part of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, the Sieurs Dado Henry, Baron of Knvp|hau&s;en, his privy coun&s;ellor of emba&s;&s;y, and mini&s;ter plenipotentiary at the court of London; and Louis Michel, his re&s;ident and charg&eacute; d'a&s;&s;airo$</NOTE>. This treaty, which was &s;igned at We&s;t|min&s;ter,
imported, &startq;That the contracting powers having
mutually re&s;olved to continue their efforts for their reci|procal
defen&s;e and &s;ecurity, for the recovery of their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions,
the protection of their allies, and the &s;upport of
the liberties of the Germanick body, his Britannick Ma|je&s;ty
had, from the&s;e con&s;iderations, determined to grant
to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty an immediate &s;uccour in money,
as being the mo&s;t ready and the mo&s;t efficacious, and their
Maje&s;ties having judged it proper that thereupon a con|vention
&s;hould be made, for declaring and fixing their in|centions
upon this head, they had nominated and autho|ri&s;ed
their re&s;pective mini&s;ters, who, after having commu|nicated
their full powers to one another, agreed to the fol|lowing
&s;tipulations:&mdash;The King of Great-Britain engaged
to pay in the city of London, to &s;uch per&s;on as &s;hould be
authori&s;ed to receive it by his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, the &s;um of
four millions of German crowns, amounting to &s;ix hundred
and &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, to be paid at once,
and in one whole &s;um, immediately after the exchange of
ratifications, upon being demanded by his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty.
This prince, on his part, obliged him&s;elf to apply
that &s;um to the maintaining and augmenting his forces,
which &s;hould act in the be&s;t manner for the good of the
common cau&s;e, and for the purpo&s;e of reciprocal defen&s;e
and mutual &s;ecurity, propo&s;ed by their &s;aid Maje&s;ties.
Moreover, the high contracting parties engaged not to
conclude any treaty of peace, truce, or neutrality, nor any
other &s;ort of convention or agreement, with the powers
engaged in the pre&s;ent war, but in concert and by mutual
<PB N="221" REF="225">
agreement, wherein both &s;hould be nominally compre|hended.
Finally, it was &s;tipulated that this convention
&s;hould be ratified, and the ratifications exchanged on both
&s;ides, within the term of &s;ix weeks, to be computed from
the day of &s;igning this pre&s;ent convention, or &s;ooner, if
po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. All the re&s;olutions to which the committee
of ways and means agreed were executed by bills, or
clau&s;es in bills, which afterwards received the royal &s;anc|tion.
The militia &s;till continued to be an object of par|liamentary
care and attention: but the in&s;titution was not
yet heartily embraced, becau&s;e &s;eemingly di&s;countenanced
by the remnant of the old mini&s;try, which &s;till maintained
a capital place in the late coalition, and indeed almo&s;t
wholly engro&s;&s;ed the di&s;tribution of pen&s;ions and places.
The Commons having pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to his Ma|je&s;ty,
with re&s;pect to the harbour of Milford-haven, a
book of plans and e&s;timates for fortifying that harbour
was laid before the Hou&s;e, and a committee appointed to
examine the particulars. They were of opinion that the
mouth of the harbour was too wide to admit of any forti|fication,
or effectual defen&s;e; but that the pa&s;&s;age called
Nailand point, lying higher than Hubber&s;tone-road, might
be fortified, &s;o as to afford &s;afe riding and protection to
the trade and navy of Great-Britain: that, if it &s;hould
be thought proper hereafter to e&s;tabli&s;h a yard and dock
for building and equipping fleets at Milford, no place
could, from the &s;ituation, nature, &s;oil, and a general
concurrence of all nece&s;&s;ary local circum&s;tances, be more
fitted for &s;uch a de&s;ign: that if a proper u&s;e were made
of this valuable though long-neglected harbour, the
di&s;tre&s;sful delays, too often embarra&s;&s;ing and di&s;appointing
the nation in her naval operations, might be in a great
mea&s;ure happily removed, to the infinite relief and en|largement
of the kingdom in the means of improving its
naval force; the nece&s;&s;ary progre&s;s and free execution of
which was now &s;o unhappily and frequently re&s;trained and
fru&s;trated, by the want of a harbour like that of Milford|haven,
<PB N="222" REF="226">
framed by nature with &s;uch local advantages&punc;
This report appeared to be &s;o well &s;upported by evidence,
that a bill was framed, and pa&s;&s;ed into an act, for granting
ten thou&s;and pounds towards carrying on the works for
fortifying and &s;ecuring the harbour of Milford in the
county of Pembroke. Other laws of national con&s;equence
were enacted, in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, with little of
no oppo&s;ition. On the very fir&s;t day of their &s;itting, the
Commons received a petition from the mayor, magi&s;trates,
merchants, and inhabitants of Liverpool, complaining
of the high price of wheat, and other grain; expre&s;&s;ing
their apprehen&s;ion that it would continue to ri&s;e, unle&s;s
the time for the importation of foreign corn duty free
&s;hould be prolonged, or &s;ome other &s;alutary mea&s;ure taker
by parliament, to prevent dealers from engro&s;&s;ing corn
&s;ubmitting to the wi&s;dom of the Hou&s;e a total prohibitio$
of di&s;tilling and exporting grain while the high price
&s;hould continue; praying they would take the premi&s;&s;es
into con&s;ideration, and grant a &s;ea&s;onable relief to the
petitioners, by a continuance of a free importation, and
taking &s;uch other effectual means to reduce the growing
price of corn as to them &s;hould &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary and ex|pedient.
This being an urgent ca&s;e, that equally inte|re&s;ted
the humanity of the legi&s;lature and the manu|factures
of the kingdom, it was deliberated upon, and
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with remarkable de&s;patch. In a few days a bill
was prepared, pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es, and enacted
into a law, continuing till the twenty-fourth day of De|cember,
in the pre&s;ent year, the three acts of la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion
for prohibiting the exportation of corn; for prohibiting
the di&s;tillation of &s;pirits; and for allowing the importation
of corn duty free. A &s;econd law was e&s;tabli&s;hed, regu|lating
the price and a&s;&s;i&s;e of bread, and &s;ubjecting to
&s;evere penalties tho&s;e who &s;hould be concerned in its
adulteration. In con&s;equence of certain re&s;olutions taken
in a committee of the whole Hou&s;e, a bill was pre&s;ented
for prohibiting the payment of the bounty upon the
exportation of corn, unle&s;s &s;old at a lower price than is
<PB N="223" REF="227">
allowed in an act pa&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t year of the reign of
William and Mary: but this bill, after having been read
a &s;econd time, and committed, was neglected, and proved
abortive.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. In con&s;equence of a motion made by Mr.
Grenville, a humane bill was prepared and brought in
for the encouragement of &s;eamen employed in the royal
navy, e&s;tabli&s;hing a regular method for the punctual,
frequent, and certain payment of their wages; enabling
them more ea&s;ily and readily to remit money for the &s;upport
of their wives and families, and preventing the frauds and
abu&s;es attending &s;uch payments. This bill, having pa&s;&s;ed
the Lower Hou&s;e, engaged in a very particular manner
the attention of the Lords, who, by divers me&s;&s;ages to
the Hou&s;e of Commons, de&s;ired the attendance of &s;everal
members. The&s;e me&s;&s;ages being taken into con&s;ideration,
&s;everal precedents were recited; a debate aro&s;e about their
formality, and the Hou&s;e unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved that a
me&s;&s;age &s;hould be &s;ent to the Lords, acquainting them
that the Hou&s;e of Commons, not being &s;ufficiently in|formed
by their me&s;&s;ages upon what grounds, or for what
purpo&s;es, their lord&s;hips de&s;ired the Hou&s;e would give
leave to &s;uch of their members as were named in the &s;aid
me&s;&s;ages to attend the Hou&s;e of Lords, in order to be
examined upon the &s;econd reading of the bill; the Com|mons
hoped their lord&s;hips would make them acquainted
with their intention. The Lords, in an&s;wer to this in|timation,
gave the Commons to under&s;tand, that they
de&s;ired the attendance of the members mentioned in their
me&s;&s;ages, that they might be examined as witne&s;&s;es upon
the &s;econd reading of the bill. This explanation being
deemed &s;atisfactory, the members attended the Hou&s;e of
Lords, where they were carefully and fully examined, as
per&s;ons conver&s;ant in &s;ea-affairs, touching the inconve|niencies
which had formerly attended the &s;ea-&s;ervice, as
well as the remedies now propo&s;ed: and the bill having
pa&s;&s;ed through their Hou&s;e, though not without warm
oppo&s;ition, was enacted into a law by his Maje&s;ty's
<PB N="224" REF="228">
a&s;&s;ent. The militia-act, as it pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion,
being found upon trial defective, Mr. Town&s;hend moved
for leave to bring in a new bill, to explain, amend, and
enforce it: this was accordingly allowed, prepared, and
pa&s;&s;ed into a law; though it did not &s;eem altogether free
from material objections, &s;ome of which were of an alarm|ing
nature. The power ve&s;ted by law in the crown
over the militia is even more independent than that
which it exerci&s;es over the &s;tanding army: for this la&s;t
expires at the end of the year, if not continued by a new act
of parliament; whereas the militia is &s;ubjected to the power
of the crown for the term of five years, during which it may
be called out into actual &s;ervice without con&s;ent of parlia|ament,
and con&s;equently employed for &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es.
A commi&s;&s;ion-officer in the militia may be detained, as
&s;ubject to the articles of war, until the crown &s;hall allow
the militia to return to their re&s;pective pari&s;hes; and thus
engaged, he is liable to death as a mutineer, or de&s;erter,
&s;hould he refu&s;e to appear in arms, and fight in &s;upport of
the wor&s;t mea&s;ures of the wor&s;t mini&s;ter. Several mer|chants,
and manufacturers of &s;ilk, offered a petition, re|pre&s;enting,
that in con&s;equence of the act pa&s;&s;ed in the
la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, allowing the importation of fine organzine
Italian thrown &s;ilk till the fir&s;t day of December in the
year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty &s;even, they had
given orders to their corre&s;pondents abroad to &s;end large
quantities of &s;uch &s;ilk through Germany to Hamburgh and
Holland, which in the common cour&s;e of things might
probably have arrived in London before the act expired,
if their carriage had not been protracted by the great rains
and inundations in Italy and Germany, in the months of
Augu&s;t and September la&s;t, which rendered the roads for
many weeks impa&s;&s;able: that from unlucky accidents on
&s;hore, and &s;torms and contrary winds after the &s;ilk was
&s;hipped, it could not po&s;&s;ibly arrive within the time limit|ed
by the act; and unle&s;s it &s;hould be admitted to an
entry, they, the petitioners, would be great &s;u&s;&s;erers,
the manufactures greatly prejudiced, and the good end
<PB N="225" REF="229">
and purpo&s;e of the act in a great mea&s;ure fru&s;trated: they,
therefore, prayed leave to bring in a bill for allowing the
introduction of all &s;uch fine Italian organized &s;ilk as
&s;hould appear to have been &s;hipped in Holland and Ham|burgh
for London, on or before the fir&s;t day of December.
The petition being referred to a committee, which re|ported
that the&s;e allegations were true, the Hou&s;e com|plied
with their reque&s;t, and the bill having pa&s;&s;ed, was
enacted into a law in the u&s;ual form. A &s;peedy pa&s;&s;age
was likewi&s;e granted to the mutiny bill, and the other
annual mea&s;ure for regulating the marine forces, which
contained nothing new or extraordinary. A committee
being appointed to enquire what laws were already ex|pired,
or near expiring, they performed this difficult talk
with indefatigable patience and per&s;everance; and, in pur|&s;uance
of their re&s;olutions, three bills were prepared and
pa&s;&s;ed into laws, continuing &s;ome acts for a certain time,
and rendering others perpetual<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Among tho&s;e rendered perpetual, we find an act of the 13th and 14th of Charles II. for preventing theft and rapine.

&sect; XXXVI. The lord-mayor, aldermen, and commons of
the city of London, in common-council a&s;&s;embled, having
drawn up a petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons, alledging
that the toll upon loaded ve&s;&s;els, or other craft, pa&s;&s;ing
through the arches of London-Bridge, granted by a
former act, pa&s;&s;ed in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and fifty, for improving, widening, and enlarging the
pa&s;&s;age both under and over the &s;aid bridge, was alto|gether
precarious, and in&s;ufficient to defray the expen&s;e,
including that of a temporary wooden bridge already
erected; and praying that a bill might be prepared, for ex|plaining
and rendering that act effectual; a committee
was appointed to examine the contents, and a bill brought
in according to their reque&s;t. This, however, was op|po&s;ed
by a petition from &s;everal per&s;ons, owners of barges
and other craft navigating the river Thames, who
affirmed, that if the bill &s;hould pa&s;s into a law as it then
&s;tood, it would be extremely injurious to the petitioners
in particular, and to the publick in general. The&s;e were
heard by their coun&s;el before the committee, but no report
was yet given, when the temporary bridge was reduced to
a&s;hes. Then the mayor, aldermen, and commons of
London pre&s;ented another petition, alledging, that, in
pur&s;uance of the powers ve&s;ted in them by act of parlia|ment,
they had already demoli&s;hed a good number of the
hou&s;es on London-Bridge, and directed the re&s;t that were
&s;tanding to be taken down with all convenient expedition,
that two of the arches might be laid into one for the im|provement
of the navigation; that they had, at a very
great expen&s;e, erected a temporary wooden bridge, to
pre&s;erve a publick pa&s;&s;age to and from the city, until the
great arch could be fini&s;hed, which temporary bridge
being con&s;umed by fire, they mu&s;t rebuild it with the
greate&s;t expedition, at a further con&s;iderable expen&s;e;
that the &s;um nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on and completing
this great and u&s;eful work, including the rebuilding of
the &s;aid temporary bridge, was e&s;timated at four&s;core
thou&s;and pounds; and as the improving, widening, and
enlarging London-Bridge was calculated for the general
<PB N="227" REF="231">
good of the public, for the advancement of trade and
commerce, and for making the navigation upon the river
Thames more &s;afe and &s;ecure; they, therefore, prayed the
Hou&s;e to take the premi&s;&s;es into con&s;ideration. This pe|tition
being recommended by his Maje&s;ty to the con&s;ider|ation
of the Hou&s;e, was referred to the committee of
&s;upply, and produced the re&s;olution of granting fifteen
thou&s;and pounds towards the rebuilding of London-Bridge.
A bill was prepared, under the title of an act to im|prove,
widen, and enlarge the pa&s;&s;age over and through
London-Bridge, enforcing the payment of the toll im|po&s;ed
upon loaded ve&s;&s;els, which had been found extremely
burthen&s;ome to trade; but this incumbrance was pre|vented
by another petition of &s;everal merchants, trade&s;|men,
and other inhabitants of the borough of Southwark,
taking notice of the fifteen thou&s;and pounds granted to|wards
the repair of London-Bridge, and, as they were
informed, intended to make the &s;aid bridge free for all
his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects: they &s;aid they hoped to partake of
this public bounty; but afterwards hearing that the bill
then depending was confined to the tolls formerly granted
for repairing the &s;aid bridge, they repre&s;ented the hard|&s;hips
which they and all traders would continue to labour
under; they alledged, that the &s;urveyors and workmen
then employed upon this work had di&s;covered the true
principles on which the bridge was built; that the foun|dation
of the piers con&s;i&s;ted of hard durable &s;tone, well ce|mented
together, and now as &s;trong and firm as when fir&s;t
built; that when the bridge &s;hould be fini&s;hed, great &s;avings
would be made in keeping it in repair, from the &s;ums formerly
expended, on a mi&s;taken opinion, that the foundation was of
wood: that there were very con&s;iderable e&s;tates appointed
&s;olely for the repairs of the bridge, which, they apprehend|ed,
would be &s;ufficient to maintain it without any toll; or if
they &s;hould not be thought adequate to that purpo&s;e, they
hoped the deficiency would not be made up by a toll upon
trade and commerce, but rather by an impo&s;ition on
coaches, chariots, chai&s;es, and &s;addle-hor&s;es. This re|mon&s;trance
<PB N="228" REF="232">
made no impre&s;&s;ion on the Hou&s;e. The bill
being, on the motion of Sir John P&mdash;s, read a third time,
pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es, and obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. The intere&s;t of the manufactures was
al&s;o con&s;ulted in an act encouraging the growth of madder,
a plant e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in dying and printing callicoes,
which may be rai&s;ed in England without the lea&s;t incon|venience.
It was judged, upon enquiry, that the mo&s;t
effectual means to encourage the growth of this commo|dity
would be to a&s;certain the tithe of it, and a bill was
brought in for that purpo&s;e. The rate of the tithe was
e&s;tabli&s;hed at five &s;hillings an acre; and it was enacted,
that this law &s;hould continue in force for fourteen years,
and to the end of the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament; but
wherefore this encouragement was made temporary it is
not ea&s;y to determine. The laws relating to the poor,
though equally numerous and oppre&s;&s;ive to the &s;ubject,
having been found defective, a new clau&s;e, relating to
the &s;ettlement of &s;ervants and apprentices, was now added
to an act pa&s;&s;ed in the twentieth year of the pre&s;ent reign,
intituled, &startq;An act for the better adju&s;ting and more ea&s;y
recovery of the wages of certain &s;ervants, and of certain
apprentices.&endq; No country in the univer&s;e can produce
&s;o many laws made in behalf of the poor as tho&s;e that are
daily accumulating in England; in no other country is there
&s;o much money rai&s;ed for their &s;upport, by private charity,
as well as publick taxation; yet this, as much as any
country, fwarms with vagrant beggars, and &s;eems with
objects of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s; a &s;ure &s;ign either of mi&s;|conduct
in the legi&s;lature, or of &s;hameful relaxation
in the executive part of the civil admini&s;tration.&mdash;The
&s;cenes of corruption, perjury, riot, and intemperance
which every election for a member of parliament had
lately produced were now grown &s;o infamou&s;ly open and
intolerable, and the right of voting was rendered &s;o ob&s;cure
and perplexed by the preten&s;ions and proceedings of all
the candidates for Oxford&s;hire in the la&s;t election, that
the fundamentals of the con&s;titution &s;eemed to &s;hake, and
<PB N="229" REF="233">
the very e&s;&s;ence of parliaments to be in danger. Actuated
by the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, Sir John Phillips, a gentleman of
Wales, who had long di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the oppo|&s;ition,
by his courage and independent &s;pirit, moved for
leave to bring in a bill that &s;hould obviate any doubts
which might ari&s;e concerning the electors of knights of
the &s;hire to &s;erve in parliament for England, and further
regulate the proceedings of &s;uch elections. He was
accordingly permitted to bring in &s;uch a bill, in conjunction
with Mr. Town&s;hend, Mr. Cornwall, and Lords North
and Carysfort; and in the u&s;ual cour&s;e, the bill being pre|pared,
was enacted into a law, under the title of, &startq;An act
for further explaining the laws touching the electors of
knights of the &s;hire to &s;erve in parliament for that part of
Great-Britain called England.&endq; The preamble &s;pecified,
That though, by an act pa&s;&s;ed in the eighteenth year of
the pre&s;ent reign, it was provided, that no per&s;on might
vote at the election of a knight or knights of a &s;hire
within England and Wales, without having a freehold
e&s;tate, in the county for which he votes, of the clear yearly
value of forty &s;hillings, over and above all rents and
charges, payable out of or in re&s;pect to the &s;ame; never|thele&s;s,
certain per&s;ons, who hold their e&s;tates by copy of
court-roll, pretend to a right of voting, and have, at
certain times, pre&s;umed to vote at &s;uch elections: this
act, therefore, ordained, that from and after the twenty-ninth
day of June, in the pre&s;ent year, no per&s;on who
holds his e&s;tate by copy of court-roll &s;hould be entitled
thereby to vote at the election of any knight or knights of
a &s;hire within England or Wales; but every &s;uch vote
&s;hould be void, and the per&s;on &s;o voting &s;hould forfeit
fifty pounds to any candidate for whom &s;uch vote &s;hould not
have been given, and who &s;hould fir&s;t &s;ue for the &s;ame, to
be recovered with full co&s;ts, by action of debt, in any court
of judicature<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">For the more ea&s;y recovery of this forfeit, it was ena$ted. That the plain|tiff in &s;uch action might only &s;et forth, in the declarations or bill, that the de&s;endant was indebted to him in the &s;um of fifty pounds, alledging the of|fen&s;e for which the &s;uit &s;hould be brought, and that the de&s;endant had acted contrary to this act, without mentioning the writ of &s;ummons to parliament, or the return thereof; and. upon trial of any i&s;&s;ue, the plaintiff &s;hould not be obliged to prove the writ of &s;ummons to parliament, or the return thereof, or any warrant or authority to the &s;heriff upon any &s;uch writ: that every &s;uch action &s;hould be commenced within nine months after the fact committed; and that, if the plaintiff &s;hould di&s;continue his action, or be non&s;uited, or have judgement given again&s;t him, the defendant &s;hould recover treble co&s;ts.</NOTE>. So far the act, thus procured, may be at|tended
<PB N="230" REF="234">
with &s;alutary con&s;equences: but, in all probability,
the intention of its fir&s;t movers and patrons was not fully
an&s;wered; ina&s;much as no provi&s;ion was made for putting
a &s;top to that &s;pirit of licen&s;e, drunkenne&s;s, and debauch|ery,
which prevails at almo&s;t every election, and has a
very pernicious effect upon the morals of the people.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. Among the bills that mi&s;carried in the
cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ome turned on points of great con&s;e|quence
to the community. Lord Barrington, Mr. Thomas
Gore, and Mr. Charles Town&s;hend, were ordered by the
Hou&s;e to prepare a bill for the &s;peedy and effectual re|cruiting
his Maje&s;ty's land forces and marines, which was
no more than a tran&s;cript of the temporary act pa&s;&s;ed in
the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion under the &s;ame title; but the majo|rity
were aver&s;e to its being continued for another year,
as it was attended with &s;ome prejudice to the liberty of the
&s;ubject. Objections of the &s;ame nature might have been
as ju&s;tly &s;tarted again&s;t another bill, for the more effectu|ally
manning of his Maje&s;ty's navy, for preventing de|&s;ertion,
and for the relief and encouragement of &s;eamen
belonging to &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els in the &s;ervice of the mer|chants.
The purport of this project was to e&s;tabli&s;h re|gi&s;ters
or mu&s;ter-rolls of all &s;eamen, fi&s;hermen, lighter|men,
and watermen; obliging &s;hip-ma&s;ters to leave &s;ub|&s;cribed
li&s;ts of their re&s;pective crews at offices, maintained
for that purpo&s;e, that a certain number of them might be
cho&s;en by lot for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice in any ca&s;e of
emergency. This expedient, however, was rejected, as
an unnece&s;&s;ary and ineffectual incumbrance on commerce,
which would hamper navigation, and in a little time di|mini&s;h
the number of &s;eamen, of con&s;equence act dia|metrically
oppo&s;ite to the purpo&s;e for which it was con|trived.&mdash;Numberle&s;s
<PB N="231" REF="235">
frauds having been committed, and
ince&s;&s;ant law&s;uits produced, by private and clande&s;tine
conveyances, a motion was made, and leave given, to form
a bill for the publick regi&s;tering of all deeds, conveyances,
wills, and other incumbrances, that might affect any
honours, manours, lands, tenements, and hereditaments,
within the kingdom of England, wherein publick regi&s;ters
were not already appointed by act of parliament: but this
mea&s;ure, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the a&s;certainment and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of property, met with a violent oppo&s;ition; and was
finally dropped, as &s;ome people imagine, through the in|fluence
of tho&s;e who, perhaps, had particular rea&s;ons for
countenancing the pre&s;ent my&s;terious forms of convey|ancing.
Such a bill mu&s;t al&s;o have been di&s;agreeable and
mortifying to the pride of tho&s;e landholders who&s;e e&s;tates
were incumbered, becau&s;e, in con&s;equence of &s;uch a re|gi&s;ter,
every mortgage under which they laboured would
be exactly known.&mdash;The next object to which the Hou&s;e
converted its attention, was a bill explaining and amend|ing
a late act for e&s;tabli&s;hing a fi&s;h-market in the city of
We&s;tmin&s;ter, and preventing &s;candalous monopolies of a
few engro&s;&s;ing fi&s;h-mongers, who impo&s;ed exorbitant
prices on their fi&s;h, and in this particular branch of traffick
gave law to above &s;ix hundred thou&s;and of their fellow|citizens.
Abundance of pains was taken to render this
bill effectual, for putting an end to &s;uch flagrant impo|&s;ition.
Enquiries were made, petitions read, coun&s;el
heard, and alterations propo&s;ed: at length the bill, having
pa&s;&s;ed through the Lower Hou&s;e, was conveyed to the
Lo $ ds, among whom it was &s;uffered to expire, on pretence
that there was not time &s;ufficient to expire, or pretence
the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The occa&s;ion that produced the next bill
which mi&s;carried we &s;hall explain, as an incident equally
extraordinary and intere&s;ting. By an act pa&s;&s;ed in the
preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, for recruiting his Maje&s;ty's land-forces
and marines, we have already ob&s;erved, that the commi&s;|&s;ioners
thereby appointed were ve&s;ted with a power of judg|ing
<PB N="232" REF="236">
ultimately whether the per&s;ons brought before them
were &s;uch as ought, by the rules pre&s;cribed in the act, to
be impre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice: for it was expre&s;sly pro|vided,
that no per&s;on, &s;o impre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners,
&s;hould be taken out of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice by any proce&s;s,
other than for &s;ome criminal accu&s;ation. During the
rece&s;s of parliament, a gentleman having been impre&s;&s;ed
before the commi&s;&s;ioners, and con&s;ined in the Savoy, his
friends made application for a habeas-corpus, which pro|duced
&s;ome he&s;itation, and indeed an in&s;urmountable diffi|culty:
for, according to the writ of habeas-corpus, pa&s;&s;ed
in the reign of Charles the Second, this privilege relates
only to per&s;ons committed for criminal or &s;uppo&s;ed crimi|nal
matters and the gentleman did not &s;tand in that pre|dicament.
Before the que&s;tion could be determined he
was di&s;charged, in con&s;equence of an application to the
&s;ecretary at war; but the nature of the ca&s;e plainly
pointed out a defect in the act, &s;eemingly of the mo&s;t
dangerous con&s;equence to the liberty of the &s;ubject. In
order to remedy this defect, a bill for giving a more &s;peedy
relief to the &s;ubject, upon the writ of habeas-corpus,
was prepared, and pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Commons,
which formed it&s;elf into a committee, and made &s;everal
amendments. It imported, that the &s;everal provi&s;ions
made in the afore&s;aid act, pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of Charles II.
for the awarding of writs of habeas-corpus, in ca&s;es of
commitment, or detainer, for any criminal or &s;uppo&s;ed
criminal matter, &s;hould, in like manner, extend to all
ca&s;es where any per&s;on, not being committed or detained
for any criminal or &s;uppo&s;ed criminal matter, &s;hould be
confined, or re&s;trained of his or her liberty, under any
colour or preten&s;e what&s;oever: that, upon oath made by
&s;uch per&s;on &s;o con&s;ined or re&s;trained, or by any other on
his or her behalf, of any actual con&s;inement or re&s;traint,
and that &s;uch con&s;inement or re&s;traint, to the be&s;t of
the knowledge and belief of the per&s;on &s;o applying, was
not by virtue of any commitment or detainer for any
criminal or &s;uppo&s;ed criminal matter, an habeas-cor|pus,
<PB N="233" REF="237">
directed to the per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;o confining or
re&s;training the party, as afore&s;aid, &s;hould be awarded
and granted, in the &s;ame manner as is directed, and
under the &s;ame penalties as are provided by the &s;aid
act, in the ca&s;e of per&s;ons committed and detained for
any criminal or &s;uppo&s;ed criminal matter: that the per&s;on
or per&s;ons before whom the party &s;o confined or re&s;trained
&s;hould be brought, by virtue of any hubeas-corpus granted
in the vacation-time, under the authority of this act,
might and &s;hould, within three days after the return
made, proceed to examine into the facts contained in
&s;uch return, and into the cau&s;e of &s;uch confinement
and e&s;traint; and thereupon either di&s;charge, or bail, or
remand the parties &s;o brought, as the ca&s;e &s;hould require,
and as to ju&s;tice &s;hould appertain. The re&s;t of the bill
related to the return of the writ in three days, and the
penalties incurred by tho&s;e who &s;hould neglect or refu&s;e
to make the que return, or to comply with any other
clau&s;e of this regulation. The Commons &s;eemed hearty
in rearing up this additional buttre&s;s to the liberty of their
fellow &s;ubjects, and pa&s;&s;ed the bill with the mo&s;t laudable
alacrity: but in the Hou&s;e of Lords &s;uch a great number
of objections was &s;tarted, that it &s;unk at the &s;econd read|ing,
and the judges were ordered to prepare a bill for
the &s;ame purpo&s;e, to be laid before that Hou&s;e in the next
&s;eilion.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. His Maje&s;ty having recommended the care of
the Foundling-Ho&s;pital to the Hou&s;e of Commons, which
chearfully granted forty thou&s;and pounds for the &s;upport
of that charity, the growing annual expen&s;e of it appear|ed
worthy of further con&s;ideration, and leave was granted
to bring in a bill, for obliging all the pari&s;hes of England
and Wales to keep regi&s;ters of all their deaths, births,
and marriages, that from the&s;e a fund might be rai&s;ed
towards the &s;upport of the &s;aid ho&s;pital. The bill was
accordingly prepared by a committee appointed for the
purpo&s;e; but before the Hou&s;e could take the report into
con&s;ideration the parliament was prorogued. The pro|prietors
<PB N="234" REF="238">
of the privateer called the Antigallican, which
had taken a rich French &s;hip homeward-bound from
China, and carried her into Cadix, where the Spani&s;h
government had wre&s;ted her by violence from the captors,
and delivered her to the French owners, now pre&s;ented a
petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons, complaining of this
interpo&s;ition as an act of partiality and inju&s;tice; repre|&s;enting
the great expen&s;e at which the privateer had been
equipped, the legality of the capture, the lo&s;s and hard&s;hips
which they the petitioners had &s;u&s;tained, and imploring
&s;uch relief as the Hou&s;e &s;hould think requi&s;ite. Though
the&s;e allegations were &s;upported by a &s;pecies of evidence
that &s;eemed &s;trong and convincing, and it might be though
incumbent on the parliament to vindicate the honour of
the nation, when thus in&s;ulted by a foreign power, the
Hou&s;e, upon this occa&s;ion, treated the petition with the
mo&s;t mortifying neglect, either giving little credit to the
a&s;&s;ertions it contained, or unwilling to take any &s;tep
which might at this juncture embroil the nation with the
court of Spain on &s;uch a friyolous &s;ubject. True it is
the Spani&s;h government alledged, in their own ju&s;tifi|cation,
that the prize was taken under the guns of Co|runna,
in&s;omuch that the &s;hot fired by the privateer
entered that place, and damaged &s;ome hou&s;es: but this
allegation was never properly &s;u&s;tained, and the prize
was certainly condemned as legal by the court of Admi|ralty
at Gibraltar.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. As we have already given a detail of the trial of
Sir John Mordaunt, it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to recapitulate
any circum&s;tances of that affair, except &s;uch as relate to
its connexion with the proceedings of parliament. In the
beginning of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, Lord Barrington, as &s;ecretary
at war, informed the Hou&s;e, by his Maje&s;ty's command&punc;
that Lieutenant General Sir John Mordaunt, a member
of that Hou&s;e, was in arre&s;t for di&s;obedience of his Ma|je&s;ty's
orders, while employed on the late expedition to
the coa&s;t of France. The Commons immediately re&s;olv|ed,
That an addre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty
<PB N="235" REF="239">
returning him the thanks of this Hou&s;e for his gracious
me&s;&s;age of that day, in the communication he had been
plea&s;ed to make of the rea&s;on for putting Lieutenant-General
Sir John Mordaunt in arre&s;t. Among the va|rious
objects of commerce that employed the attention of
the Hou&s;e, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable was the trade to
the coa&s;t of Africa, for the protection of which an annual
&s;um had been granted for &s;ome years, to be expended in
the maintenance and repairs of ca&s;tles and factories.
While a committee was employed in peru&s;ing the accounts
relating to the &s;um granted in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion for
this purpo&s;e, a petition from the committee of the African
company, recommended in a me&s;&s;age from his Maje&s;ty,
was pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e, &s;oliciting further a&s;&s;i&s;tance
for the en&s;uing year. In the mean time, a remon&s;trance
was offered by certain planters and merchants, intere&s;ted
in and trading to the Briti&s;h &s;ugar colonies in America,
alledging, that the price of n$groes was greatly advanced
&s;ince the forts and &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Africa had
been under the direction of the committee of the company
of merchants trading to that coa&s;t; a circum&s;tance that
greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and alarmed the petitioners, prevented
the cultivation of the British colonies, and was a great
detriment to the trade and navigation of the kingdom:
that this misfortune, they believed, was in &s;ome mea&s;ure
owing to the ruinous &s;tate and condition of the forts and
&s;ettlements: that, in their opinion, the mo&s;t effectual
method for maintaining the intere&s;t of that trade on a
re&s;pectable footing, next to that of an incorporated joint|&s;tock
company, would be putting tho&s;e forts and &s;ettle|ments
under the &s;ole direction of the commi&s;&s;ioners for
trade and plantations: that the pre&s;ervation or ruin of the
American &s;ugar colonies went hand in hand with that of
the &s;lave trade to Africa: that, by an act pa&s;&s;ed in the
year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty, for extending
and improving this trade, the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects were de|barred
from lodging theri &s;laves and merchandi&s;e in the
&s;orts and &s;ettlements on the coa&s;ts: they, therefore,
<PB N="236" REF="240">
prayed that this part of the act might be repealed; that
all commanders of Briti&s;h and American ve&s;&s;els, free mer|chants,
and all other his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, who were
&s;ettled, or might at any time thereafter &s;ettle in Africa,
&s;hould have free liberty, from &s;un-ri&s;e to &s;un-&s;et, to enter
the forts and &s;ettiements, and to depo&s;it their good&punc; and
merchandi&s;e in the warehou&s;es thereunto belonging; to
&s;ecure their &s;laves or oth&egrave;r purcha&s;es without paying any
con&s;ideration for the &s;ame; but the &s;laves to be victualled
at the proper co&s;t and charge of their re&s;pective owners.
The Hou&s;e having taken this petition into con&s;ideration,
enquired into the proceedings of the company, and revi&s;ed
the act for extending and improving the trade to Africa,
re&s;olved, that the committee of the African company
had faithfully di&s;charged the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, and
granted ten thou&s;and pounds for maintaining the Briti&s;h
forts and &s;ettlements in that part of the world. The ene|my
were perfectly well acquainted with the weakne&s;s of the
Briti&s;h ca&s;tles on the coa&s;t of Africa; and had they known
as well how to execute with &s;pirit, as to plan with &s;agacity,
the attempt which, in the cour&s;e of the preceding year,
they made upon the principal Briti&s;h fort in Guinea
would have &s;ucceeded, and all the other &s;ettlements would
have fallen into their hands without oppo&s;ition<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Robert Hunter Morrie, repre&s;ented, in a petition to the Hou&s;e, that $word$ no falt was made in the Briti&s;h colonies in America, they were $word$ to depend upon a precarious &s;upply of that commodity from foreigners; he therefore, offered to undertake the making of $span$ at a moderate price in one of tho&s;e colonies, at his own ri&s;que and charge, provided h$ could be &s;ecured in the enjoyment of the profits which the work $word$ pro|duce, for &s;uch a term of years as might &s;eem to the Hou&s;e a proper $punc; compen&s;ation for &s;o great an undertaking.

&sect; XLII. The longe&s;t and warme&s;t debate which was
maintained in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion aro&s;e from a mo|tion
for leave to bring in a bill for &s;hortening the term
and duration of future parliaments; a mea&s;ure truly pa|triotical,
again&s;t which no &s;ub&s;tantial argument could be
produced, although the motion was rejected by the ma|jority,
on pretence, that, whil&s;t the nation was engaged in
&s;uch a dangerous and expen&s;ive war, it would be im|proper
to think of introducing &s;uch an alteration in the
form of government. Rea&s;ons of equal &s;trength and &s;o|lidity
will never be wanting to the patrons and mini&s;ters
of C&mdash;n and V&mdash;. The alteration propo&s;ed
was nothing le&s;s than removing and ann$lling an en|croachment
which had been made on the con&s;titution:
it might have been effected without the lea&s;t pang or con|vul&s;ion,
to the general &s;atisfaction of the nation: far from
being unrea&s;onable at this juncture, it would have en|hanced
the national reputation abroad, and rendered the
war more formidable to the enemies of Great-Britain, by
convincing them that it was &s;upported by a mini&s;try and
parliament, who &s;tood upon &s;uch good terms with the
people. Indeed, a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of parliaments might
have di&s;concerted, and perhaps expelled that &s;pirit of con|fidence
and genero&s;ity which now &s;o remarkably e&s;pou&s;ed
and gratified the &s;&mdash;'s predilection for the intere&s;t
of H&mdash;. Other committees were e&s;tabli&s;hed, to en|quire
into the expen&s;e incurred by new lines and fortifica|tions
rai&s;ed at Gibraltar; to examine the original &s;tandards
of weights and mea&s;ures u&s;ed in England; con&s;ider the laws
relating to them, and report their ob&s;ervations, together
with their opinion of the mo&s;t effectuals means for a&s;|certaining
and enforcing uniform &s;tandards to be u&s;ed for
the future. The Commons were perfectly &s;atisfied with
the new works which had been rai&s;ed at Gibraltar; and
with re&s;pect to the weights and mea&s;ures, the committee
agreed to certain re&s;olutions, but no further progre&s;s was
made in this enquiry, except an order for printing the&s;e
re&s;olutions, with the appendix; however, as the boxes
<PB N="238" REF="242">
containing the &s;tandards were ordered to be locked up by
the clerk of the Hou&s;e, in all probability their intention
was to proceed on this &s;ubject in &s;ome future &s;e&s;&s;ion. On
the ninth day of June &s;undry bills received the royal a&s;&s;ent
by commi&s;&s;ion, his Maje&s;ty being indi&s;po&s;ed; and on the
twentieth day of the &s;ame month, the lords commi&s;&s;ioners
clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech to both Hou&s;es, expre&s;&s;ing
his Maje&s;ty's deep &s;en&s;e of their loyalty and good affection,
demon&s;trated in their late proceedings, in their zeal for his
honour and real intere&s;t in all parts, in their earne&s;tne&s;s
to &s;urmount every difficulty, in their ardour to maintain
the war with the utmo&s;t vigour; proofs which mu&s;t con|vince
mankind that the ancient &s;pirit of the Briti&s;h nation
&s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in its full force. They were given to under|&s;tand
that the King had taken all &s;uch mea&s;ures as appear|ed
the mo&s;t conducive to the accompli&s;hment of their pub|lick-&s;pirited
views and wi&s;hes; that with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
crowned by the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon the conduct and
bravery of the combined army, his Maje&s;ty had been ena|bled,
not only to deliver his dominions in Germany from
the oppre&s;&s;ions and deva&s;tations of the French, but al&s;o
to pu&s;h his advantages on this &s;ide the Rhine; that he
had cemented the union between him and his good brother
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, by new engagements; that the Bri|ti&s;h
fleets and armies were now actually employed in &s;uch ex|peditions
as appeared likely to annoy the enemy in the mo&s;t
&s;en&s;ible manner, and to promote the welfare and pro&s;perity
of the&s;e kingdoms; in particular, to pre&s;erve the Briti&s;h
rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in America, and to make France
feel, in tho&s;e parts, the real &s;trength and importance of
Great-Britain. The Commons were thanked for the am|ple
&s;upplies which they had &s;o freely and unanimou&s;ly
given, and a&s;&s;ured on the part of his Maje&s;ty that they
&s;hould be managed with the mo&s;t frugal oeconomy. They
were de&s;ired, in con&s;equence of the King's earne&s;t recom|mendation,
to promote harmony and good agreement
among&s;t his faithful &s;ubjects; to make the people ac|quainted
with the rectitude and purity of his intentions
<PB N="239" REF="243">
and mea&s;ures, and to exert them&s;elves in maintaining the
peace and good order of the country, by enforcing obe|dience
to the laws and lawful authority.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. Never, &s;urely, had any &s;overeign more rea|&s;on
to be plea&s;ed with the conduct of his mini&s;ters, and
the &s;pirit of his people. The whole nation repo&s;ed the
mo&s;t unbounded confidence in the courage and di&s;cretion,
as well as in the integrity of the mini&s;ter, who &s;eemed
eager upon pro&s;ecuting the war with &s;uch vigour and
activity as appeared almo&s;t unexampled in the annals of
Great-Britain. New levies were made, new &s;hips put in
commi&s;&s;ion, fre&s;h expeditions undertaken, and fre&s;h con|que&s;ts
projected. Such was the credit of the admini&s;tra|tion,
that people &s;ub&s;cribed to the government loans with
&s;urpri&s;ing eagerne&s;s. An unu&s;ual &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e and
re&s;olution &s;eemed to in&s;pire all the individuals that con&s;ti|tuted
the army and navy; and the pa&s;&s;ion for military
fame diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through all ranks in the civil depart|ment
of life, even to the very dregs of the populace: &s;uch
a remarkable change from indolence to activity, from in|difference
to zeal, from timorous caution to fearle&s;s ex|ecution,
was effected by the influence and example of an
intelligent and intrepid mini&s;ter, who, chagrined at the
inactivity and di&s;graces of the preceding campaign, had,
on a very &s;olemn occa&s;ion, lately declared his belief that
there was a determined re&s;olution, both in the naval and
military commanders, again&s;t any vigorous exertion of the
national power in the &s;ervice of the country. He affirmed,
that though his Maje&s;ty appeared ready to embrace every
mea&s;ure propo&s;ed by his mini&s;ters for the honour and in|tere&s;t
of his Briti&s;h dominions, yet &s;carce a man could be
found with whom the execution of any one plan in which
there was the lea&s;t appearance of any danger could with
confidence be tru&s;ted. He particulari&s;ed the inactivity of
one general in North-America, from who&s;e abilities and
per&s;onal bravery the nation had conceived great expec|tations:
he complained, that this noble commander had
expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t contemptuous di&s;regard for the civil
<PB N="240" REF="244">
power, from which he derived his authority, by neglecting
to tran&s;mit, for a con&s;iderable length of time, any othe$
advice of his proceedings but what appeared on a writte$
&s;crap of paper: he ob&s;erved, that with a force by land an$
&s;ea greater than ever the nation had heretofore main
tained, with a King and mini&s;ter ardently de&s;irous $word$
redeeming her glory, &s;uccouring her allies, and promotin$
her true intere&s;t, a &s;hameful di&s;like to the &s;ervice ever
where prevailed, and few &s;eemed affected with any othe$
zeal than that of a&s;piring to the highe&s;t po&s;ts, and gra&s;pin$
the large&s;t &s;alaries. The cen&s;ure levelled at the command$
in America was founded on mi&s;take: the inactivity $word$
that noble lord was not more di&s;appointing to the mini&s;t$$
than di&s;agreeable to his own inclination. He u&s;ed $word$
utmo&s;t endeavours to an&s;wer the expectation of the pub|lick,
but his hands were effectually tied by an ab&s;olu$$
impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s, and his conduct &s;tood ju&s;tified $word$
the eyes of his &s;overeign. A particular and accurate deta$$
of his proceedings he tran&s;mitted through a canal, whic$
he imagined would have directly conveyed it to the foot
the throne; but the packet was &s;aid to have been pur
po&s;ely intercepted and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. Perhaps he was n$$
altogether excu&s;eable for having corre&s;ponded &s;o &s;light
with the &s;ecretary of &s;tate; but he was &s;aid to have go$$
abroad in full per&s;ua&s;ion that the mini&s;try would $word$
changed, and therefore his a&s;&s;iduities were principal$
directed to the great per&s;onage, who, in that ca&s;e, woul$
have &s;uperintended and directed all the operations of th$
army. All &s;orts of military preparations in founderie$
docks, ar&s;enals, rai&s;ing and exerci&s;ing troops, and victualling tran&s;ports, were now carried on with &s;uch diligen$$
and di&s;patch as &s;eemed to promi&s;e an exertion that woul$
&s;oon obliterate the di&s;agreeable remembrance of pa&s;t di&s;
grace. The beginning of the year was, however, a little
clouded by a general concern for the death of his Maje&s;ty$$
third daughter, the Prince&s;s Caroline, a lady of the mo&s;$
exemplary virtue and amiable character, who died at th$
<PB N="241" REF="245">
age of forty-five, &s;incerely regretted as a pattern of unaf|fected
piety, and unbouuded benevolence.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. The Briti&s;h crui&s;ers kept the &s;ea during all
the &s;everity of winter, in order to protect the commerce
of the kingdom, and annoy that of the enemy. They
exerted them&s;elves with &s;uch activity, and their vigilance
was attended with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that a great number of
prizes was taken, and the trade of France almo&s;t totally
extingui&s;hed. A very gallant exploit was atchieved by
one Captain Bray, commander of the Adventure, a &s;mall
armed ve&s;&s;el in the government's &s;ervice: falling in with
the Machault, a large privateer of Dunkirk, near Dun|genne&s;s,
he ran her a board, fa&s;tened her bolt&s;prit to his
cap&s;tan, and after a warm engagement compelled her
commander to &s;ubmit. A French frigate of thirty-&s;ix
guns was taken by Capt. Parker, in a new fire-&s;hip of
inferior force. Divers privateers of the enemy were &s;unk,
burned, or taken, and a great number of merchant-&s;hips
fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h. Nor was the &s;ucce&s;s
of the Briti&s;h &s;hips of was confined to the Engli&s;h chan|nel.
At this period the board of Admiralty received in|formation
from Admiral Cotes, in Jamaica, of an action
which happened off the i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola, in the month
of October of the preceding year, between three Engli&s;h
&s;hips of war and a French &s;quadron. Captain Forre&s;t,
an officer of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit in the &s;ervice, had, in the
&s;hip Augu&s;ta, failed from Port-Royal in Jamaica, accom|panied
by the Dreadnought and Edinburgh, under the
command of the Captains Suckling and Langdon. He
was ordered to crui&s;e off Cape Franc&ccedil;ois, and this &s;ervice
he literally performed in the face of the French &s;quadron
under Ker&s;in, lately arrived at that place from the coa&s;t of
Africa. This commander, piqued at &s;eeing him&s;elf thus
in&s;ulted by an inferior armament, re&s;olved to come forth
and give them battle; and that he might either take them,
or at lea&s;t drive them out of the&s;e &s;eas, &s;o as to afford a free
pa&s;&s;age to a great number of merchant-&s;hips then lying
<PB N="242" REF="246">
at the Cape, bound for Europe, he took every precaution
which he thought nece&s;&s;ary, to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. He re-en|forced
his &s;quadron with &s;ome &s;tore-&s;hips, mounted with
guns and armed for the occa&s;ion, and &s;upplied the defi|ciency
in his complements, by taking on board &s;eamen
from the merchant &s;hips, and &s;oldiers from the garri&s;on.
Thus prepared, he weighed anchor, and &s;tood out to &s;ea,
having under his command four large &s;hips of the line,
and three &s;tout frigates. They were no &s;ooner perceived
advancing, than Captain Forre&s;t held a &s;hort council with
his two captains. &startq;Gentlemen (&s;aid he) you know our
own &s;trength, and &s;ee that of the enemy; &s;hall we
give them battle?&endq; They replying in the affirmative,
he added, &startq;Then fight them we will; there is no time
to be lo&s;t; return to your &s;hips, and get them ready for
engaging.&endq; After this laconick con&s;ultation among
the&s;e three gallant officers, they bore down upon the
French &s;quadron without further he&s;itation, and between
three and four in the afternoon the action began with great
impetuo&s;ity. The enemy exerted them&s;elves with uncom|mon
&s;pirit, con&s;cious that their honour was peculiarly at
&s;take, and that they fought in &s;ight, as it were, of their
own coa&s;t, which was lined with people, expecting to &s;ee
them return in triumph. But, notwith&s;tanding all their en|deavours,
their commodore, after having &s;u&s;tained a &s;evere
engagement, that la&s;ted two hours and a half, found his
&s;hip in &s;uch a &s;hattered condition, that he made &s;ignal for
one of his frigates to come and tow him out of the line.
His example was followed by the re&s;t of his &s;quadron,
which, by this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, with the favour of the land breeze
and the approach of night, made &s;hift to accompli&s;h their
e&s;cape from the three Briti&s;h &s;hips, which were too much
di&s;abled in their ma&s;ts and rigging to pro&s;ecute their
victory. One of the French &s;quadron was rendered alto|gether
un&s;erviceable for action: their lo&s;s in men amount|ed
to three hundred killed, and as many wounded; whereas
that of the Engli&s;h did not much exceed one third of this
number. Neverthele&s;s, they were &s;o much damaged,
<PB N="243" REF="247">
that, being unable to keep the &s;ea, they returned to Ja|maica,
and the French commodore &s;ei&s;ed the opportunity
of &s;ailing with a great convoy for Europe. The courage
of Captain Forre&s;t was not more con&s;picuous in his en|gagement
with the French &s;quadron near Cape Franc&ccedil;ois,
than his conduct and &s;agacity in a &s;ub&s;equent adventure
near Port-au-Prince, a French harbour, &s;ituated at the
bottom of a bay on the we&s;tern part of Hi&s;paniola, behind
the &s;mall i&s;land of Gonave. After M. de Ker&s;in had
taken his departure from Cape Fran&ccedil;ois for Europe, Ad|miral
Cotes, beating up to windward from Port-Royal in
Jamaica with three &s;hips of the line, received intelligence
that there was a French fleet at Port-au-Prince, ready to
&s;ail on their return to Europe: Captain Forre&s;t then pre|&s;ented
the Admiral with a plan for an attack on this place,
and urged it earne&s;tly. This, however, was declined, and
Captain Forre&s;t directed to crui&s;e off the i&s;land Gonave
for two days only, the admiral enjoining him to return at
the expiration of the time, and rejoin the &s;quadron at
Cape-Nicholas. Accordingly, Captain Forre&s;t, in the
Augu&s;ta, proceeded up the bay, between the i&s;land Go|nave
and Hi&s;paniola, with a view to execute a plan which
he had him&s;elf projected. Next day in the afternoon,
though he perceived two &s;loops, he forebore cha&s;ing, that
he might not ri&s;que a di&s;covery; for the &s;ame purpo&s;e he
hoi&s;ted Dutch colours, and di&s;gui&s;ed his &s;hip with tarpau|lins.
At five in the afternoon he di&s;covered &s;even &s;ail of
&s;hips &s;teering to the we&s;tward, and hauled from them, to
avoid &s;u&s;picion; but at the approach of night gave cha&s;e
with all the &s;ail he could carry. About ten he perceived
two &s;ail, one of which fired a gun, and the other made
the be&s;t of her way for Leoganne, another harbour in the
bay. At this period Captain Forre&s;t reckoned eight &s;ail
to leeward, near another port called Petit Goave; coming
up with the &s;hip which had fired a gun, &s;he &s;ubmitted
without oppo&s;ition, after he had hailed, and told her cap|tain
what he was, produced two of his large&s;t cannon,
and threatened to &s;ink her if &s;he &s;hould give the lea&s;t alarm.
<PB N="244" REF="248">
He forthwith &s;hifted the pri&s;oners from this prize, and
placed on board of her five-and-thirty of his own crew,
with orders to &s;tand for Petit Goave and intercept any
of the fleet that might attempt to reach that harbour.
Then he made &s;ail after the re&s;t, and in the dawn of the
morning, finding him&s;elf in the middle of their fleet, he
began to fire at them all in their turns, as he could bring
his guns to bear: they returned the fire for &s;ome time; at
length the Marguerite, the Solide, and the Theodore &s;truck
their colours. The&s;e being &s;ecured, were afterwards u&s;ed
in taking the Maurice, Le Grand, and La Flore; the
Brilliant al&s;o &s;ubmitted, and the Mars made &s;ail, in
hopes of e&s;caping, but the Augu&s;ta coming up with her
about noon, &s;he likewi&s;e fell into the hands of the victor.
Thus, by a well-conducted &s;tratagem, a whole fleet of
nine &s;ail were taken by a &s;ingle &s;hip, in the neighbourhood
of four or five harbours, in any one of which they would
have found immediate &s;helter and &s;ecurity. The prizes,
which happened to be richly laden, were &s;afely conveyed
to Jamaica, and there &s;old at public auction, for the
benefit of the captors, who may &s;afely challenge hi&s;tory to
produce &s;uch another in&s;tance of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. The mini&s;try having determined to make vi|gorus
e$$orts again&s;t the enemy in North-America, Ad|miral
Bo&s;cawen was ve&s;ted with the command of the fleet
de&s;tined for that &s;ervice, and &s;ailed from St. Helen's on
the nineteenth day of February, when the Invincible, of
&s;eventy-four guns, one of the be&s;t &s;hips that con&s;tituted his
&s;quadron, ran a-ground and peri&s;hed; but her men, &s;tores,
and artillery were &s;aved. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ucceed|ing
month Sir Edward Hawke &s;teered into the Bay of
Bi&s;$ay with another &s;quadron, in order to intercept any
&s;upplies from France de&s;igned for Cape-Breton or Canada;
and about the &s;ame time the town of Embden, belong|ing
to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, which had fallen into the
hands of the enemy, was &s;uddenly retrieved by the conduct
of Commodore Holmes, &s;tationed on that coa&s;t, who &s;ent
up two of his &s;mall &s;hips to anchor in the river between
<PB N="245" REF="249">
Knok and the city. The garri&s;on, amounting to three
thou&s;and &s;even hundred men, finding them&s;elves thus cut
off from all communication with the country below, aban|doned
the place with great precipitation, and &s;ome of their
baggage being &s;ent off by water, was taken by the boats
which the Commodore armed for that purpo&s;e. It was
in the &s;ame month that the Admiralty received advice of
another advantage by &s;ea, which had been gained by Ad|miral
O&s;borne, while he crui&s;ed between Cape de Gatt
and Carthagena on the coa&s;t of Spain. On the twenty-eighth
day of March he fell in with the French &s;quadron,
commanded by the Marquis du Que&s;ne, con&s;i&s;ting of four
&s;hips, namely, the Foudroyant, of eighty guns, the Orph&eacute;e,
of &s;ixty-four, the Oriflamme, of fifty, and the Pleiade fri|gate,
of twenty-four, in their pa&s;&s;age from Toulon to
re-enforce M. de la Clue, who had for &s;ome time been
blocked up by Admiral O&s;borne in the harbour of Cartha|gena.
The enemy no &s;ooner perceived the Engli&s;h &s;qua|dron
than they di&s;per&s;ed, and &s;teered different cour&s;es:
then Mr. O&s;borne detached divers &s;hips in pur&s;uit of each,
while he him&s;elf, with the body of his fleet, &s;tood off for
the bay of Carthagena, to watch the motions of the French
&s;quadron which lay there at anchor. About &s;even in the
evening, the Orph&eacute;e, having on board five hundred men,
&s;truck to Captain Storr, in the Revenge, who lo&s;t the calf
of one leg in the engagement, during which he was &s;u|&s;tained
by the &s;hips Berwick and Pre&s;ton. The Mon|mouth,
of &s;ixty-four guns, commanded by Captain Gar|dener,
engaged the Foudroyant, one of the large&s;t &s;hips in
the French navy, mounted with four&s;core cannon, and
containing eight hundred men, under the direction of the
Marquis de Que&s;ne. The action was maintained with
great fury on both &s;ides, and the gallant Captain Garden|er
lo&s;t his life; neverthele&s;s, the fight was continued with
unabating vigour by his lieutenant, Mr. Carkett, and the
Foudroyant di&s;abled in &s;uch a manner, that her comman|der
&s;truck, as &s;oon as the other Engli&s;h &s;hips, the Swift|&s;ure
and the Hampton-Court, appeared. This mortifying
<PB N="246" REF="250">
&s;tep, however, he did not take until he &s;aw his &s;hip lie
like a wreck upon the water, and the decks covered with
carnage. The Oriflamme was driven on &s;hore under the
ca&s;tle of Aiglos, by the &s;hips Montague and Monarque,
commanded by the Captains Rowley and Montague, who
could not complete their de&s;truction without violating the
neutrality of Spain. As for the Pleiade frigate, &s;he made
her e&s;cape by being a prime &s;ailor. This was a &s;evere
&s;troke upon the enemy, who not only lo&s;t two of their
capital &s;hips, but &s;aw them added to the navy of Great-Britain,
and the di&s;a&s;ter was followed clo&s;e by another,
which they could not help feeling with equal &s;en&s;ibility
of mortification and chagrin. In the beginning of April,
Sir Edward Hawke, &s;teering with his &s;quadron into Ba&s;que|road,
on the coa&s;t of Poictou, di&s;covered, off the i&s;le of
Aix, a French fleet at anchor, con&s;i&s;ting of five &s;hips of
the line, with &s;ix frigates, and forty tran&s;ports, having on
board three thou&s;and troops, and a large quantity of &s;tores
and provi&s;ions, intended as a &s;upply for their &s;ettlements
in North-America. They no &s;ooner &s;aw the Engli&s;h
Admiral advancing, than they began to &s;lip their cables,
and $ly in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. Some of them e&s;caped
by &s;ea, but the greater number ran into &s;hoal water,
where they could not be pur&s;ued; and next morning
they appeared a-ground, lying on their broad&s;ides. Sir
Edward Hawke, who had rode all night at anchor a-brea&s;t
of the i&s;le of Aix, furni&s;hed the &s;hips Intrepid and Med-way
with tru&s;ty pilots, and &s;ent them farther in when the
&s;tood began to make, with orders to found a-head, that he
might know whether there was any po&s;&s;ibility of attack|ing
the enemy, but the want of a &s;ufficient depth of wa|ter
rendered this &s;cheme impracticable. In the mean
time, the French threw over-board their cannon, &s;tores,
and balla&s;t; and boats and launches from Rochefort were
employed in carrying out warps, to drag their &s;hips through
the &s;oft mud, as &s;oon as they &s;hould be water-borne by
the flowing-tide. By the&s;e means their large &s;hips of war,
and many of their tran&s;ports, e&s;caped into the river Cha|rente;
<PB N="247" REF="251">
but their loading was lo&s;t, and the end of their
equipment totally defeated. Another convoy of merchant
&s;hips, under the protection of three frigates, Sir Edward
Hawke, a few days before, had cha&s;ed into the harbour
of St. Martin's, in the i&s;le of Rh&eacute;, where they &s;till re|mained,
waiting an opportunity for hazarding a &s;econd
departure: a third, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve &s;ail, bound from
Bourdeaux to Quebeck, under convoy of a frigate and arm|ed
ve&s;&s;el, was encountered at &s;ea by one Briti&s;h &s;hip of the
line and two fire-&s;hips, which took the frigate and arm|ed
ve&s;&s;el, and two of the convoy afterwards met with the
&s;ame fate; but this advantage was over-balanced by the lo&s;s
of Captain James Hume, commander of the Pluto fire-&s;hip,
a brave accompli&s;hed officer, who, in an unequal combat
with the enemy, refu&s;ed to quit the deck even when he
was di&s;abled, and fell gloriou&s;ly, covered with wounds,
exhorting the people, with his late&s;t breath, to continue
the engagement while the &s;hip could &s;wim, and acquit
them&s;elves with honour in the &s;ervice of their country.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVI. On the twenty-ninth day of May the Rai|&s;onnable,
a French &s;hip of the line, mounted with &s;ixty-four
cannon, having on board &s;ix hundred and thirty men,
commanded by the Prince de Mombazon Chevalier de
Rohan, was, in her pa&s;&s;age from Port l'Orient to Bre&s;t,
attacked by Captain Dennis, in the Dor&s;et&s;hire, of &s;eventy
guns, and taken after an ob&s;tinate engagement, in which
one hundred and &s;ixty men of the Prince's complement
were killed or wounded, and he &s;u&s;tained great damage in
his hull, &s;ails, and rigging. The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es were more|over
chequered by the tidings of a lamentable di&s;a&s;ter that
befell the &s;hip Prince George, of eighty guns, commanded
by Rear-Admiral Broderick, in his pa&s;&s;age to the Medi|terranean.
On the thirteenth day of April, between one
and two in the afternoon, a dreadful fire broke out in the
fore part of the &s;hip, and raged with &s;uch fury, that not|with&s;tanding
all the efforts of the officers and men for
&s;everal hours, the flames increa&s;ed, and the &s;hip being con|&s;umed
to the water's edge, the remnant &s;unk about &s;ix
<PB N="248" REF="252">
o'clock in the evening. The horrour and con&s;ternation of
&s;uch a &s;cene are not ea&s;ily de&s;cribed. When all endea|vours
proved fruitle&s;s, and no hope of pre&s;erving the &s;hip
remained, the barge was hoi&s;ted out for the pre&s;ervation of
the Admiral, who entered it accordingly; but all di&s;tinc|tion
of per&s;ons being now aboli&s;hed, the &s;eamen ru&s;hed
into it in &s;uch crouds, that in a few moments it over&s;et.
The admiral, fore&s;eeing that this would be the ca&s;e, &s;trip|ped
off his clothes, and committing him&s;elf to the mercy of
the waves, was &s;aved by the boat of a merchant-&s;hip, after
he had &s;u&s;tained him&s;elf in the &s;ea a full hour by &s;wim|ing.
Captain Payton, who was the &s;econd in command,
remained upon the quarter-deck as long as it was po&s;&s;ible
to keep that &s;tation, and then de&s;cending by the &s;tern
ladder, had the good fortune to be taken into a boat be|longing
to the Alderney &s;loop. The hull of the &s;hip,
ma&s;ts, and rigging, were now in a blaze, bur&s;ting tremen|dous
in &s;everal parts through horrid clouds of &s;moak;
nothing was heard but the crackling of the flames, mingled
with the di&s;mal cries of terror and di&s;traction; nothing
was &s;een but acts of phrenzy and de&s;pertation. The
mi&s;erable wretches, affrighted at the horrours of &s;uch a
conflagration, &s;ought a fate le&s;s dreadful, by plunging into
the &s;ea, and about three hundred men were pre&s;erved by
the boats belonging to &s;ome &s;hips that accompanied the
Admiral in his voyage, but five hundred peri&s;hed in the
ocean.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVII. The King of Great-Britain being deter|mined
to renew his attempt upon the coa&s;t of France, or|dered
a very formidable armament to be equipped for that
purpo&s;e. Two powerful &s;quadrons by &s;ea were de&s;tined
for the &s;ervices of this expedition, the fir&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of
eleven great &s;hips, was commanded by Lord An&s;on and
Sir Edward Hawke: the other, compo&s;ed of four &s;hips of
the line, &s;even frigates, &s;ix &s;loops, two fire-&s;hips, two
bombs, ten cutters, twenty tenders, ten &s;tore-&s;hips, and
one hundred tran&s;ports, was put under the direction of
Commodore Howe, who had &s;ignali&s;ed him&s;elf by his
<PB N="249" REF="253">
gallantry and conduct in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t fruitle&s;s
expedition. The plan of a de&s;cent upon France having
been adopted by the mini&s;try, a body of troops, con&s;i&s;ting
of &s;ixteen regiments, nine troops of light-hor&s;e, and &s;ix
thou&s;and marines, was a&s;&s;embled for the execution of this
de&s;ign, and embarked under the command of the Duke of
Marlborough; a nobleman, who, though he did not in|herit
all the military genius of his grandfather, yet far ex|celled
him in the amiable and &s;ocial qualities of the heart:
he was brave beyond all que&s;tion, generous to profu&s;ion,
and good-natured to exce&s;s. On this occa&s;ion, he was
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the councils of Lord George Sackville, &s;econd
in command, &s;on to the Duke of Dor&s;et; an officer of
experience and reputation, who had, in the civil depart|ments
of government, exhibited proofs of extraordinary
genius and uncommon application. The troops, having
been encamped for &s;ome time upon the I&s;le of Wight, were
embarked in the latter end of May, and the two fleets
&s;ailed in the beginning of June for the coa&s;t of Bretagne,
$eaving the people of England flu&s;hed with the gaye&s;t hopes
of victory and conque&s;t. The two fleets parted at &s;ea:
Lord An&s;on, with his &s;quadron, proceeded to the bay of
Bi&s;cay, in order to watch the motions of the enemy's &s;hips,
and harra&s;s their navigation; while Commodore Howe,
with the land-forces, &s;teered directly towards St. Maloes, a
$trong place of con&s;iderable commerce, &s;ituated on the
coa&s;t of Bretagne, again&s;t which the purpo&s;ed inva&s;ion
$eemed to be chiefly intended. The town, however, was
$ound too well fortified, both by art and nature, to admit
$f an attempt by &s;ea with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; and,
$herefore, it was re&s;olved to make a de&s;cent in the neigh|$ourhood.
After the fleet had been, by contrary winds,
$etained &s;everal days in &s;ight of the French coa&s;t, it ar|$$ved
in the bay of Cancalle, about two leagues to the
$a&s;tward of St. Maloes, and Mr. Howe having &s;ilenced a
$mall battery which the enemy had occa&s;ionally rai&s;ed upon
$he beach, the troops were landed, without further oppo|$$tion,
on the &s;ixth day of June. The Duke of Marl|borough
<PB N="250" REF="254">
immediately began his march towards St. Servan$
with a view to de&s;troy &s;uch &s;hipping and magazines as
might be in any acce&s;&s;ible parts of the river; and this
&s;cheme was executed with &s;ucce&s;s. A great quantity of
naval &s;tores, two &s;hips of war, &s;everal privateers, and abou$
four&s;core ve&s;&s;els of different &s;orts, were &s;et on fire, an$
reduced to a&s;hes, almo&s;t under the cannon of the place
which, however, they could not pretend to be&s;iege i$
form. His grace having received repeated advices tha$
the enemy were bu&s;ily employed in a&s;&s;embling forces to
march again&s;t him, returned to Cancalle, where Mr$
Howe had made &s;uch a ma&s;terly di&s;po&s;ition of the boats
and tran&s;ports, that the re-embarkation of the troops was
performed with &s;urpri&s;ing ea&s;e and expedition. Th$
forces, while they remained on &s;hore, were re&s;trained from
all outrages by the mo&s;t &s;evere di&s;cipline; and the French
hou&s;es, which their inhabitants had abandoned, were left
untouched. Immediately after their landing, the Duke
of Marlborough, as commander in chief, publi&s;hed and
di&s;tributed a manife&s;to, addre&s;&s;ed to the people of Bre|tagne,
giving them to under&s;tand, that his de&s;cent upon
the coa&s;t was not effected with a de&s;ign to make war on
the inhabitants of the open country, except &s;uch as &s;hould
be found in arms, or otherwi&s;e oppo&s;ing the operations of
his Britannick Maje&s;ty: that all who were willing to con|tinue
in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their effects, might re|main
unmole&s;ted in their re&s;pective dwellings, and follow
their u&s;ual occupations; that, be&s;ides the cu&s;toms and
$axes they u&s;ed to pay to their own King, nothing &s;hould
be required of them but what was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for
the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the army; and that, for all provi&s;ions
brought in, they &s;hould be paid in ready money. He
concluded this notice with declaring, that if, notwith|&s;tanding
the&s;e a&s;&s;urances of protection, they &s;hould carry
off their effects and provi&s;ions, and abandon the places of
their habitation, he would treat them as enemies, and de|&s;troy
their hou&s;es with fire and &s;word. To the magi|&s;tracy
of St. Maloes he likewi&s;e &s;ent a letter, importing,
<PB N="251" REF="255">
that as all the inhabitants of the towns and villages be|$$een
Dinant, Rennes, and Doll, now in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
$d de&s;erted their habitations, probably to avoid the pay|$ent
of the u&s;ual contributions; and he being informed
$$at the magi&s;trates had compelled the people of the coun|try
to retire into the town of St. Malo$s, he now gave
$$em notice, that if they did not immediately &s;end them
$$ck to their hou&s;es, and come them&s;elves to his head|quarters,
to &s;ettle the contributions, he &s;hould think him|&s;elf
obliged to proceed to military execution. The&s;e
$$reats, however, were not put in force, although the magi|&s;trats,
of St. Maloes did not think proper to comply with his
$$junction. But it was found altogether impo&s;&s;ible to pre|$ent
irregularities among troops that were naturally licen|$ous.
Some hou&s;es were pillaged, and not without acts
$ barbarity: but the offenders were brought to immediate
$tice; and it mu&s;t be owned, as an inconte&s;table proof
$word$ the general's humanity, that in de&s;troying the maga|$$nes
of the enemy at St. Servan, which may be termed
$$e &s;uburbs of St. Maloes, he ordered one &s;mall &s;tore|$ou&s;e,
to be &s;pared, becau&s;e it could not be &s;et on fire with|out
endangering the whole di&s;trict. The Briti&s;h forces
$eing re-embarked, including about five hundred light|$or&s;e,
which had been di&s;ciplined and carried over with a
$$ew to &s;cour the country, the fleet was detained by con|$$ary
winds in the bay of Cancalle for &s;everal days, during
which a de&s;ign &s;eems to have been formed for attacking
Granville, which had been reconnoitred by &s;ome of the
$$ngineers: but, in con&s;equence of their report, the
$$heme was laid a&s;ide, and the fleet &s;tood out to &s;ea, where
$word$ was expo&s;ed to &s;ome rough weather. In a few days,
$he wind blowing in a northern direction, they &s;teered
$gain towards the French coa&s;t, and ran in with the land
$$ear Havre-de-Grace, where the flat-bottomed boats, pro|$ided
for landing, were hoi&s;ted out, and a &s;econd di&s;em|$arkation
expected. But the wind blowing violently
towards the evening, the boats were re-&s;hipped, and the
$$eet obliged to quit the land, in order to avoid the dan|gers
<PB N="252" REF="256">
of a &s;ee-&s;hore. Next day, the weather being more
moderate, they returned to the &s;ame &s;tation, and orders
were given to prepare for a de&s;cent; but the Duke of
Marlborough having taken a view of the coa&s;t in an open
cutter, accompanied by Commodore Howe, thought pro|per
to wave the attempt. Their next &s;tep was to bear away
before the wind for Cherbourg, in the neighbourhood of
which place the fleet came to anchor. Here &s;ome of the
tran&s;ports received the fire of &s;ix different batteries; and
a con&s;iderable body of troops appeared in arms to di&s;pute$
the landing; neverthele&s;s, the general re&s;olved that the
forts Querqueville, l'Hommet, and Gallet &s;hould be at|tacked
in the night by the fir&s;t regiment of guards. The
&s;oldiers were actually di&s;tributed in the flat-bottomed boats,
and every preparation made for this enterpri&s;e, when the
wind began to blow with &s;uch violence, that the troops
could not be landed without the mo&s;t imminent danger
and difficulty, nor properly &s;u&s;tained in ca&s;e of a repul&s;e,
even if the di&s;embarkation could have been effected. This
attempt, therefore, was laid a&s;ide, but at the &s;ame time a
re&s;olution taken to &s;tand in towards the &s;hore with the
whole fleet, to cover a general landing. A di&s;po&s;ition was
made accordingly, but the &s;torm increa&s;ing, the tran&s;|ports
ran &s;oul of each other, and the &s;hips were expo&s;ed to
all the perils of a $ce-&s;hore, for the gale blew directly upon
the coa&s;t; be&s;ides, the provi&s;ions began to fail, and the hay
for the hor&s;es was almo&s;t con&s;umed. The&s;e concurring
rea&s;ons induced the commanders to po&s;tpone the di&s;em|barkation
to a more favourable opportunity. The fleet
&s;tood out to &s;ea, the tempe&s;t abated, they &s;teered for the
I&s;le of Wight, and next day anchored at St. Helen's.
Such was the i&s;&s;ue of an enterpri&s;e atchieved with con&s;i|derable
&s;ucce&s;s, if we con&s;ider the damage done to the
enemy's &s;hipping, and the other objects which the mini&s;try
had in view; namely, to &s;ecure the navigation of the
channel, and make a diver&s;ion in favour of German allies,
by alarming the French King, and obliging him to em|ploy
a great number of troops to defend his coa&s;t from
<PB N="253" REF="257">
in&s;ult and inva&s;ion: but whether &s;uch a mighty arma|ment
was nece&s;&s;ary for the accompli&s;hment of the&s;e petty
$ims, and whether the &s;ame armament might not have
been employed in executing &s;chemes of infinitely greater
advantage to the nation, we &s;hall leave to the judicious
$eader's own reflection.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVIII. The de&s;igns upon the coa&s;t of France,
though interrupted by tempe&s;tuous weather, were not
as yet laid a&s;ide for the whole &s;ea&s;on; but, in the mean
time, the troops were di&s;embarked on the I&s;le of Wight;
and one brigade marched to the northward, to join a body
of troops with which the government re&s;olved to augment
the army of the allies in Germany, commanded by Prince
Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick. The Duke of Marlborough
and Lord George Sackville being appointed to conduct
this Briti&s;h corps upon the continent, the command of the
marine expeditions devolved to Lieutenant-General Bligh,
an old experienced officer, who had &s;erved with reputation;
and his royal highne&s;s Prince Edward, afterwards created
Duke of York, entered as a volunteer with Commodore
Howe, in order to learn the rudiments of the &s;ea &s;ervice.
The remainder of the troops being re-embarked, and every
thing prepared for the &s;econd expedition, the fleet &s;ailed
from St. Helen's on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t; and after a tedious
pa&s;&s;age from calms and contrary winds, anchored on the
seventh in the bay of Cherbourg. By this time the enemy
had entrenched them&s;elves within a line, extending from
the fort Ecoeurdeville, which &s;tands about two miles to
the we&s;tward of Cherbourg, along the coa&s;t for the &s;pace
of four miles, forti$ied with &s;everal batteries at proper
di&s;tances. Behind this retrenchment a body of hor&s;e and
infantry appeared in red and blue uniforms; but as they
did not advance to the open beach, the le&s;s ri&s;que was run
in landing the Briti&s;h forces. At fir&s;t a bomb-ketch had
been &s;ent to anchor near the town, and throw &s;ome &s;hells
into the place, as a $eint to amu&s;e the enemy, and deceive
them with regard to the place of di&s;embarkation, while
the general had determined to land about a league to the
<PB N="254" REF="258">
we&s;tward of Querqueville, the mo&s;t we&s;tern fort in the
bay. The other bomb-ketches, being po&s;ted along &s;hor$
did con&s;iderable execution upon the entrenchments, n$
only by throwing &s;hells in the u&s;ual way, but al&s;o $word$
u&s;ing ball-mortars, filled with great quantities of bal$$
which may be thrown to a great di&s;tance, and, by &s;catte|$ing
as they fly, do abundance of mi&s;chief. While the
ketches fired without cea&s;ing, the greanadiers and guar$
were rowed regularly a&s;hore in the flat-bottomed boat
and, landing without oppo&s;ition, in&s;tantly formed on
&s;mall open portion of the beach, with a natural breaf
work in their front, having on the other &s;ide a hollo$
way, and a village ri&s;ing beyond it with a &s;uddent a&s;cen$
on the left, the ground was inter&s;ected by hedges, an$
covered with orchards, and from this quarter the ene$$
advanced in order. The Briti&s;h troops immediately qui$ted the brea&s;t-work, in order to meet them half way, an$
a &s;traggling fire began; but the French edging to the lef$
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hill, from whence they piqueere$
with the advanced po&s;ts of the Engli&s;h. In the mean tim$
the re&s;t of the infantry were di&s;embarked, and the ene$$
at night retired. As the light troops were not yet lande$
General Bligh encamped that night at the village of Ervill$
on a piece of ground that did not extend above four hu$$
dred paces; &s;o that the tents were pitched in a crowde$
and irregular manner. Next morning, the general havin$
received intelligence that no parties of the enemy we$$
&s;een moving on the hill, or in the plain, and that Fo$$
Querqueville was entirely abandoned, made a di&s;po&s;itio$
for marching in two columns to Cherbourg. An advance
party took immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Querqueville; and th$
lines and batteries along the &s;hore were now de&s;erted b$
the enemy. The Briti&s;h forces marching behind St. Auln$$
Ecoeurdeville, Hommet, and la Gallet, found the tow$
of Cherbourg likewi&s;e abandoned, and the gates bein$
open, entered it without oppo&s;ition. The citizens, en$
couraged by a manife&s;to containing a promi&s;e of protection
<PB N="255" REF="259">
which had been publi&s;hed and di&s;tributed, in order to quiet
their apprehen&s;ions, received their new gue&s;ts with a good
grace, overwhelming them with civilities, for which they
met with a very ungrateful return; for as the bulk of the
army was not regularly encamped and &s;uperintended, the
&s;oldiers were at liberty to indulge them&s;elves in riot and
licentiou&s;ne&s;s. All night long they ravaged the adjacent
country without re&s;traint; and as no guards had been
regularly placed in the &s;treets and avenues of Cherbourg,
to prevent di&s;orders, the town it&s;elf was not exempted
from pillage and brutality. The&s;e outrages, however,
were no &s;ooner known, than the general took immediate
&s;teps for putting a &s;top to them for the pre&s;ent, and
preventing all irregularities for the future. Next
morning the place being reconnoitred, he determined to
de&s;troy, without delay, all the forts and the ba&s;on; and
the execution of this de&s;ign was left to the engineers,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the officers of the fleet and artillery. Great
&s;ums of money had been expended upon the harbour and
ba&s;on of Cherbourg, which at one time was con&s;idered
by the French court as an object of great importance,
from its &s;ituation re&s;pecting the river Seine, as well as the
oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of England; but as the works were left
unfini&s;hed, in all appearance the plan had grown into di&s;|reputation.
The enemy had rai&s;ed &s;everal unconnected
batteries along the bay, but the town it&s;elf was quite open
and defencele&s;s. While the engineers were employed
in demoli&s;hing the works, the light hor&s;e &s;coured the
country, and detachments were every day &s;ent out towards
Walloign, at the di&s;tance of four leagues from Cherbourg,
where the enemy were encamped, and every hour received
re-enforcements. Several &s;kirmi&s;hes were fought by the
out parties of each army, in one of which Capt. Lind&s;ay,
a gallant young officer, who had been very in&s;trumental
in training the light hor&s;e, was mortally wounded. Th$
harbour and ba&s;on of Cherbourg being de&s;troyed, together
with all the forts in the neighbourhood, and about twenty
pieces of bra&s;s cannon &s;ecured on board the Engli&s;h &s;hips$
<PB N="256" REF="260">
a contribution, amounting to about three thou&s;and pounds
&s;terling, was exacted upon the town, and a plan of re|embarkation
concerted, as it appeared from the reports of
pea&s;ants and de&s;erters that the enemy were already in|crea&s;ed
to a formidable number. A &s;light entrenchment
being rai&s;ed, &s;ufficient to defeat the la&s;t divi&s;ion that
&s;hould be re-embarked, the &s;tores and artillery were &s;hip|ped,
and the light hor&s;es conveyed on board their re|&s;pective
tran&s;ports, by means of platforms laid in the
flat-bottomed ve&s;&s;els. On the &s;ixteenth day of Augu&s;t,
at three o'clock in the morning, the forces marched from
Cherbourg down to the beach, and re-embarked at Fort
Galet, without the lea&s;t di&s;turbance from the enemy.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIX. This &s;ervice being happily performed, the
fleet &s;et &s;ail for the coa&s;t of England, and anchored in the
road of Weymouth, under the high land of Portland.
In two days it weighed and &s;tood again to the &s;outhward;
but was obliged, by contrary winds, to return to the &s;ame
riding. The &s;econd effort, however, was more effectual.
The fleet with &s;ome difficulty kept the &s;ea, and &s;teering
to the French coa&s;t, came to anchor in the bay of St.
Lunaire, two leagues to the we&s;tward of St. Maloes,
again&s;t which it was determined to make another attempt.
The &s;loops and ketches being ranged along &s;hore to cover
the di&s;embarkation, the troops landed on a fair open
beach, and a detachment of grenadiers was &s;ent to the
harbour of St. Briac, above the town of St. Maloes, where
they de&s;troyed about fifteen &s;mall ve&s;&s;els: but St. Maloes
it&s;elf being properly &s;ureveyed, appeared to be above in&s;ult,
either from the land-forces or the &s;hipping. The mouth
of the river that forms its ba&s;on extends above two miles
in breadth at its narrowe&s;t part, &s;o as to be out of the
reach of land-batteries, and the entrance is defended by
&s;uch forts and batteries as the &s;hips of war could not pre|tend
to &s;ilence, con&s;idering the difficult navigation of the
channel: be&s;ides fifty pieces of large cannon planted on
the&s;e forts and batteries, the enemy had mounted forty on
the we&s;t &s;ide of the town; and the ba&s;on was, moreover,
<PB N="257" REF="261">
&s;trengthened by &s;even frigates or armed ve&s;&s;els, who&s;e
guns might have been brought to bear upon any batteries
that could be rai&s;ed on &s;hore, as well as upon &s;hips entering
by the u&s;ual channel. For the&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons the
de&s;ign again&s;t St. Maloes was dropped; but the general be|ing
unwilling to re-embark without having taken &s;ome
&s;tep for the further annoyance of the enemy, re&s;olved to
penetrate into the country, conducting his motions, how|ever,
&s;o as to be near the fleet, which had, by this time,
quitted the bay of St. Lunaire, where it could not ride
with any &s;afety, and anchored in the bay of St. Cas,
about three leagues to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>&sect; L. On Friday the eighth of September, General Bligh,
with his little army, began his march for Guildo, at the
di&s;tance of nine miles, which he reached in the evening:
next day he cro&s;&s;ed a little gut or inlet of the &s;ea, at low
water, and his troops being incommoded by the pea&s;ants,
who fired at them from hedges and hou&s;es, he &s;ent a prie&s;t
with a me&s;&s;age, intimating, that if they would not de&s;i&s;t,
he would reduce their hou&s;es to a&s;hes. No regard being
paid to this intimation, the hou&s;es were actually &s;et on
fire as &s;oon as the troops had $ormed their camp about two
miles on the other &s;ide of the inlet. Next morning he
proceeded to the village of Matignon, where, after &s;ome
&s;mart &s;kirmi&s;hing, the French piquets appeared, drawn
up in order, to the number of two battalions; but having
&s;u&s;tained a few &s;hot from the Engli&s;h field-pieces, and
&s;eeing the grenadiers advance, they &s;uddenly di&s;per&s;ed.
General Bligh continuing his route through the village,
encamped in the open ground, about three miles from the
bay of St. Cas, which was this day reconnoitred for re-embarkation:
for he now received undoubted intelligence,
that the Duke d'Aiguillon had advanced from Bre&s;t to
Lambale, within &s;ix miles of the Engli&s;h camp, at the
head of twelve regular battalions, &s;ix &s;quadrons, two
regiments of militia, eight mortars, and ten pieces of
cannon. The bay of St. Cas was covered by an entrench|ment
which the enemy had thrown up, to prevent or
<PB N="258" REF="262">
oppo&s;e any di&s;embarkation; and on the out&s;ide of this
work there was a range of &s;and-hills extending along
&s;hore, which could have &s;erved as a cover to the enemy,
from whence they might have annoyed the troops in re-embarking:
for this rea&s;on a propo&s;al was made to the
General, that the forces &s;hould be re-embarked from a
fair open beach on the left, between St. Cas and Guildo;
but this advice was rejected, and, indeed, the &s;ub&s;equent
operations of the army favoured &s;trong of blind &s;ecurity
and ra&s;h pre&s;umption. Had the troops decamped in the
night without noi&s;e, in all probability they would have
arrived at the beach before the French had received the
lea&s;t intelligence of their motion; and, in that ca&s;e, the
whole army, con&s;i&s;ting of about &s;ix thou&s;and men, might
have been re-embarked without the lea&s;t interruption: but,
in&s;tead of this cautious manner of proceeding, the drums
were beating at two o'clock in the morning, as if with in|tention
to give notice to the enemy, who forthwith re|peated
the &s;ame &s;ignal. The troops were in motion before
three, and though the length of the march did not exceed
three miles, the halts and interruptions were &s;o numerous
and frequent, that they did not arrive on the beach of St.
Cas till nine. Then the embarkation was begun, and might
have been happily fini&s;hed, had the tran&s;ports lain near the
&s;hore, and received the men as fa&s;t as the boats could have
conveyed them on board, without di&s;tinction; but many
&s;hips rode at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and every boat carried
the men on board their re&s;pective tran&s;ports to which they
belonged; a punctilio of di&s;po&s;ition by which a great
deal of time was unnece&s;&s;arily con&s;umed. The &s;mall &s;hips
and bomb-ketches were brought near the &s;hore, to cover
the re-embarkation; and a con&s;iderable number of &s;ea-officers
was &s;tationed on the beach, to &s;uperintend the
boats-crews, and regulate the &s;ervice; but, notwith&s;tand|ing
all their attention and authority, &s;ome of the boats
were otherwi&s;e employed than in conveying the unhap|py
&s;oldiers. Had all the cutters and &s;mall craft belong|ing
to the fleet been properly occupied in this &s;ervice, the
<PB N="259" REF="263">
di&s;grace and di&s;a&s;ter of the day would &s;carce have happen|ed.
The Briti&s;h forces had &s;kirmi&s;hed a little on the march,
but no con&s;iderable body of the enemy appeared until the
embarkation was begun; then they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an
eminence by a wind-mill, and forthwith opened a battery
of ten cannon and eight mortars, from whence they fired
with con&s;iderable effect upon the &s;oldiers on the beach,
and on the boats in their pa&s;&s;age. They afterwards began
to march down the hill, partly covered by a hollow-way
on their left, with de&s;ign to gain a wood, where they might
form and extend them&s;elves along the front of the Engli&s;h,
and advance again&s;t them under &s;helter of the &s;and-hills;
but in their de&s;cent they &s;uffered extremely from
the cannon and mortars of the &s;hipping, which made
great havock, and threw them into confu&s;ion. Their
line of march down the hill was &s;taggered, and for &s;ome
time continued in &s;u&s;pen&s;e; then they turned off to one
&s;ide, extended them&s;elves along a hill to their left, and
advanced in a hollow way, from whence they &s;uddenly
ru&s;hed out to the attack. Though the greater part of the
Briti&s;h troops were already embarked, the rear-guard,
con&s;i&s;ting of all the grenadiers, and half of the fir&s;t regi|ment
of guards, remained on the &s;hore; to the number of
fifteen hundred, under the command of Major-General
Dury. This officer, &s;eeing the French advance, ordered
his troops to form in grand divi&s;ions, and march from be|hind
the bank that covered them, in order to charge the
enemy before they could be formed on the plain. Had
this &s;tep been taken when it was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to Mr.
Dury, before the French were di&s;engaged from the hollow
way, perhaps it might have &s;o far &s;ucceeded as to di&s;concert
and throw them into confu&s;ion: but by this time they had
extended them&s;elves into a very formidable front, and no
hope remained of being able to with&s;tand &s;uch a &s;uperior
number. In&s;tead of attempting to fight again&s;t &s;uch odds
in an open field of battle, they might have retreated along
the beach to a rock on the left, in which progre&s;s their
<PB N="260" REF="264">
right flank would have been &s;ecured by the entrenchment;
and the enemy could not have pur&s;ued them along the
&s;hore, without being expo&s;ed to &s;uch a fire from the &s;hip|ping,
as in all probability they could not have &s;u&s;tained.
This &s;cheme was like wi&s;e propo&s;ed to Mr. Dury; but he
&s;eemed to be actuated by a &s;pirit of infatuation. The
Engli&s;h line being drawn up in uneven ground began
the action with an irregular fire from right to left, which
the enemy returned; but their u&s;ual fortitude and re&s;o|lution
&s;eemed to for&s;ake them on this occa&s;ion. They &s;aw
them&s;elves in danger of being &s;urrounded, and cut in
pieces; their officers dropped on every &s;ide; and all hope
of retreat was now intercepted. In this cruel dilemma
their &s;pirits failed; they were &s;ei&s;ed with a panick; they
faultered, they broke, and in le&s;s than five minutes after
the engagement began they fled in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion,
pur&s;ued by the enemy, who no &s;ooner &s;aw them give way
than they fell in among them with their bayonets fixed,
and made a great carnage. General Dury being dange|rou&s;ly
wounded, ran into the &s;ea, where he peri&s;hed; and
this was the fate of a great number, officers as well as
&s;oldiers. Many &s;wam towards the boats and ve&s;&s;els, which
were ordered to give them all manner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but
by far the greater number were either butchered on the
beach, or drowned in the water: a &s;mall body, however,
in&s;tead of throwing them&s;elves into the &s;ea, retired to the
rock on the left, where they made a &s;tand, until they had
exhau&s;ted their ammunition, and then &s;urrendered at di&s;|cretion.
The havock was moreover increa&s;ed by the &s;hot
and &s;hells di&s;charged from the battery which the enemy
had rai&s;ed on the hill. The &s;laughter would not have
been &s;o great, had not the French &s;oldiers been exa&s;perat|ed
by the fire from the frigates, which was &s;till maintained
even after the Engli&s;h troops were routed: but this was no
&s;ooner &s;ilenced by a &s;ignal from the commodore, than the
enemy exhibited a noble example of moderation and hu|manity,
in granting immediate quarter and protection to
<PB N="261" REF="265">
the vanqui&s;hed. About one thou&s;and cho&s;en men of the
Engli&s;h army were killed and taken pri&s;oners on this oc|ca&s;ion:
nor was the advantage cheaply purcha&s;ed by the
French troops, among whom the &s;hot and &s;hells from the
frigates and ketches had done great execution. The cle|mency
of the victors was the more remarkable, as the
Briti&s;h troops in this expedition had been &s;hamefully
guilty of marauding, pillaging, burning, and other ex|ce&s;&s;es.
War is &s;o dreadful in it&s;elf, and &s;o &s;evere in its
con&s;equences, that the exerci&s;e of genero&s;ity and com|pa&s;&s;ion,
by which its horrours are mitigated, ought ever
to be applauded, encouraged, and imitated. We ought
al&s;o to u&s;e our be&s;t endeavours to de&s;erve this treatment
at the hands of a civili&s;ed enemy. Let us be humane in
our turn to tho&s;e whom the fate of war hath &s;ubjected to
our power: let us, in pro&s;ecuting our military operations,
maintain the mo&s;t rigid di&s;cipline among the troops, and
religiou&s;ly ab&s;tain from all acts of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion.
Thus, a laudable emulation will undoubtedly en&s;ue, and
the poweres at war vie with each other in humanity and
politene&s;s. In other re&s;pects, the commander of an in|vading
armament will always find his account in being
well with the common people of the country in which the
de&s;cent is made. By civil treatment and &s;ea&s;onable grati|fications,
they will be encouraged to bring into the camp
regular &s;upplies of provi&s;ion and refre&s;hment; they will
mingle with the &s;oldiers, and even form friend&s;hips among
them; &s;erve as guides, me&s;&s;engers, and interpreters; let
out their cattle for hire as draft-hor&s;es; work in their own
per&s;ons as day-labourers; di&s;cover proper fords, bridges,
roads, pa&s;&s;es, and defiles; and, if artfully managed, com|municate
many u&s;eful hints of intelligence. If great
care and circum&s;pection be not exerted in maintaining di&s;|cipline,
and bridling the licentious di&s;po&s;ition of the
&s;oldiers, &s;uch inva&s;ions will be productive of nothing but
mi&s;carriage and di&s;grace: for this, at be&s;t, is but a pirati|cal
way of carrying on war; and the troops engaged
<PB N="262" REF="266">
in it are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, debauched by the nature of
the &s;ervice. They are crowded together in tran&s;ports,
where the minute particulars of military order cannot be
ob&s;erved, even though the good of the &s;ervice greatly de|pends
upon a due ob&s;ervance of the&s;e forms. The &s;oldiers
grow negligent, and inattentive to cleanne&s;s and the ex|terior
ornaments of dre&s;s: they become &s;lovenly, &s;lothful,
and altogether unfit for a return of duty: they are tumbled
about occa&s;ionally in &s;hips and boats, landed and re-em|barked
in a tumultuous manner, under a divided and di&s;|orderly
command: they are accu&s;tomed to retire at the
fir&s;t report of an approaching enemy, and to take &s;helter
on another element; nay, their &s;mall pillaging parties are
often obliged to fly before unarmed pea&s;ants. Their duty
on &s;uch occa&s;ions is the mo&s;t unmanly part of a &s;oldier's
office; namely, to ruin, ravage, and de&s;troy. They &s;oon
yield to the temptation of pillage, and are habituated to
rapine: they give loo&s;e to intemperance, riot, and in|toxication;
commit a thou&s;and exce&s;&s;es; and, when the
enemy appears, run on board the &s;hips with their booty.
Thus the dignity of the &s;ervice is deba&s;ed: they lo&s;e all
&s;en&s;e of honour, and of &s;hame: they are no longer re|&s;tricted
by military laws, nor over-awed by the authority
of officers; in a word, they degenerate into a &s;pecies of
lawle&s;s buccaneers. From &s;uch a total relaxation of
morals and di&s;cipline, what can en&s;ue but riot, confu&s;ion,
di&s;honour, and defeat? All the advantage that can be
expected from the&s;e &s;udden &s;tarts of inva&s;ion will &s;carce
over-balance the evils we have mentioned, together with
the extraordinary expen&s;e of equipping armaments of this
nature. True it is, the&s;e de&s;cents oblige the French
King to employ a con&s;iderable number of his troops for the
defence of his maritime places: they &s;erve to ruin the trade
of his &s;ubjects, protect the navigation of Great-Britain,
and &s;ecure its coa&s;t from inva&s;ion: but the&s;e purpo&s;es
might be as effectually an&s;wered, at a much &s;maller ex|pen&s;e,
by the &s;hipping alone. Should it be judged expe|dient,
<PB N="263" REF="267">
however, to pro&s;ecute this defultory kind of war,
the commanders employed in it will do well to con&s;ider,
that a de&s;cent ought never to be hazarded in an enemy's
country, without having taken proper precautions to &s;ecure
a retreat: that the &s;evere&s;t di&s;cipline ought to be pre&s;erved
during all the operations of the campaign; that a general
ought never to di&s;embark but upon a well-concerted plan,
nor commence his military tran&s;actions without &s;ome im|mediate
point or object in view; that a re-embarkation
ought never to be attempted, except from a clear open
beach, where the approaches of an enemy may be &s;een,
and the troops covered by the fire of their &s;hipping.
Tho&s;e who pre&s;umed to reflect upon the particulars of this
la&s;t expedition owned them&s;elves at a lo&s;s to account for
the conduct of the general, in remaining on &s;hore after the
de&s;ign upon St. Maloes was laid a&s;ide; in penetrating &s;o
far into the country, without any vi&s;ible object; neglect|ing
the repeated intelligence which he received; commu|nicating
by beat of drum his midnight motions to an ene|my
of double his force; loitering near &s;even hours in a
march of three miles; and, la&s;tly, attempting the re-embar|kation
of the troops at a place where no proper mea&s;ures had
been taken for their cover and defence. After the action
of St. Cas, &s;ome civilities, by me&s;&s;age, pa&s;&s;ed between the
Duke d'Aiguillon and the Engli&s;h commanders, who were
favoured with a li&s;t of the pri&s;oners, including four &s;ea-captains;
and a&s;&s;ured that the wounded &s;hould receive all
po&s;&s;ible comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e matters being ad|ju&s;ted,
Commodore Howe returned with the fleet to Spit-head,
and the &s;oldiers were di&s;embarked.</P>
<P>&sect; LI. The &s;ucce&s;s of the attempt upon Cherbourg had
elevated the people to a degree of childi&s;h triumph; and
the government thought proper to indulge this petulant
&s;pirit of exultation, by expo&s;ing twenty-one pieces of
French cannon in Hyde-park, from whence they were
drawn in proce&s;&s;ion to the Tower, amid&s;t the acclamations
of the populace. From this pinnacle of elation and pride
<PB N="264" REF="268">
they were precipitated to the aby&s;s of de&s;pondence or de|jection,
by the account of the mi&s;carriage at St. Cas,
which buoyed up the &s;pirits of the French in the &s;ame
proportion. The people of that nation began to &s;tand in
need of &s;ome &s;uch cordial after the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;|tained,
and the mini&s;try of Ver&s;ailles did not fail to make
the mo&s;t of this advantage: they publi&s;hed a pompous
narrative of the battle at St. Cas, and magnified into a
mighty victory the puny cheek which they had given to
the rear-guard of an incon&s;iderable detachment. The
people received it with implicit belief, becau&s;e it was
agreeable to their pa&s;&s;ions, and congratulated them&s;elves
upon their &s;ucce&s;s in hyperboles, dictated by that vivacity
&s;o peculiar to the French nation. Indeed the&s;e are artifi|ces
which the mini&s;ters of every nation find it nece&s;&s;ary to
u&s;e at certain conjunctures, in governing the turbulent
and capricious multitude. After the misfortune at St. Cas,
nothing further was attempted by that armament; no$
was any enterpri&s;e of importance atchieved by the Briti&s;h
&s;hips in Europe during the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer. The
crui&s;ers, however, &s;till continued active and alert. Cap|tain
Hervey, in the &s;hip Monmouth, de&s;troyed a French
&s;hip of forty guns in the i&s;land of Malta; an exploit
of which the Malte&s;e loudly complained, as a violation
of their neutrality. About twenty &s;ail of &s;mall French
ve&s;&s;els were driven a &s;hore on the rocks of Bretagne,
by &s;ome crui&s;ers belonging to the fleet commanded by
Lord An&s;on, after a &s;mart engagement with two frigates,
under who&s;e convoy they &s;ailed. In the month of No|vember
the Belliqueux, a French &s;hip of war, mounted
with &s;ixty-four guns, having, by mi&s;take, run up St.
George's channel, and anchored in Lundy-road, Captain
Saumarez, of the Antelope, then lying in King-road,
immediately weighed and went in que&s;t of her, according
to the advice he had received. When he appeared, the
French captain heaved up his anchor, and made a &s;how of
preparing for an engagement; but &s;oon hauled down his
<PB N="265" REF="269">
colours, and without firing a &s;hot &s;urrendered, with a
complement of four hundred and &s;eventeen men, to a &s;hip
of inferior force, both in number of hands and weight of
metal.&mdash;By this time the Engli&s;h privateers &s;warmed to
&s;uch a degree in the channel, that &s;carce a French ve&s;&s;el
dur&s;t quit the harbour, and con&s;equently there was little or
no booty to be obtained. In this dearth of legal prizes,
&s;ome of the adventurers were tempted to commit acts of
piracy, and actually rifled the &s;hips of neutral nations. A
Dutch ve&s;&s;el, having on board the baggage and dome&s;ticks
belonging to the Marquis de Pignatelli, amba&s;&s;adour from
the court of Spain to the King of Denmark, was boarded
three times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by the crews of three different pri|vateers,
who forced the hatches, rummaged the hold,
broke open and rifled the trunks and boxes of the amba&s;&s;a|dour,
in&s;ulted and even cruelly brui&s;ed his officers, &s;tripped
his dome&s;ticks, and carried off his effects, together with
letters of credit, and a bill of exchange. Complaints of
the&s;e outrages being made to the court of London, the
lords of the Admiralty promi&s;ed, in the Gazette, a reward
of five hundred pounds, without deduction, to any per&s;on
who &s;hould di&s;cover the offenders concerned in the&s;e acts
of piracy. Some of them were detected accordingly, and
brought to condign puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>&sect; LII. The Dutch had for &s;ome time carried on a very
con&s;iderable traffick, not only in taking the fair advan|tages
of their neutrality, but al&s;o in &s;upplying the French
with naval &s;tores, and tran&s;porting the produce of the
French &s;ugar-colonies to Europe, as carriers hired by the
proprietors. The Engli&s;h government, incen&s;ed at this
unfair commerce, pro&s;ecuted with &s;uch flagrant partiality
for their enemies, i&s;&s;ued orders for the crui&s;ers to arre&s;t all
&s;hips of neutral powers that &s;hould have French property
on board; and the&s;e orders were executed with rigour and
&s;everity. A great number of Dutch &s;hips were taken,
and condemned as legal prizes, both in England and Ja|maica:
&s;ometimes the owners met with hard mea&s;ure,
<PB N="266" REF="270">
and &s;ome crews were treated with in&s;olence and barbarity.
The &s;ubjects of the United Provinces rai&s;ed a loud cla|mour
again&s;t the Engli&s;h, for having by the&s;e captured
violated the law of nations, and the particular treaty o$
commerce &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between Great-Britain and the Re|publick.
Remon&s;trances were made to the Engli&s;h mini|&s;try,
who expo&s;tulated in their turn with the deputies o$
the States-General; and the two nations were inflamed
again&s;t each other with the mo&s;t bitter animo&s;ity. The
Briti&s;h re&s;ident at the Hague, in a conference with the
States, repre&s;ented, that the King his ma&s;ter could n$
hope to &s;ee peace &s;peedily re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, if the neutra$
princes &s;hould a&s;&s;ume a right of carrying on the trade o$
his enemies: that he expected, from their known ju&s;tice$
and the alliance by which they were &s;o nearly connecte$
with his &s;ubjects, they would hone&s;tly abandon this fraud
$dulent commerce, and agree that naval &s;tores &s;hould b$
comprehended in the cla&s;s of contraband commodities&punc;
He an&s;wered &s;ome articles of the complaints they had mad$
with an appearance of candour and moderation; declare$
his Maje&s;ty's abhorrence of the violences which had been
committed upon the &s;ubjects of the United Provinces; ex|plained
the &s;teps which had been taken by the Engli&s;h go|vernment
to bring the offenders to ju&s;tice, as well as to
prevent &s;uch outrages for the future; and a&s;&s;ured them$
that his Britannick Maje&s;ty had nothing more at hear$
than to renew and maintain, in $ull force, the mutu$
confidence and friend&s;hip by which the maritime power
of England and Holland had been &s;o long united.</P>
<P>&sect; LIII. The&s;e profe&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem and affection we$$
not &s;ufficient to quiet the minds and appea&s;e the re&s;ent men$
of the Dutch merchants; and the French party, which
was both numerous and powerful, employed all their a$
and influence to exa&s;perate their pa&s;&s;ions, and widen th$
breach between the two nations. The court of Ve$&s;aille
did not fail to &s;ei&s;e this opportunity of in&s;inuation while
on one hand, their mini&s;ters and emi&s;&s;aries in Holland ex|aggerated
<PB N="267" REF="271">
the indignities and injuries which the States had
&s;u&s;tained, from the in&s;olence and rapacity of the Engli&s;h;
they, on the other hand, flattered and cajoled them with
little advantages in trade, and formal profe&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect.
Such was the memorial delivered by the Count D'Affry,
intimating that the Empre&s;s-Queen being under an ab&s;o|lute
nece&s;&s;ity of employing all her forces to defend her
hereditary dominions in Germany, &s;he had been obliged to
withdraw her troops from O&s;tend and Nieuport; and ap|plied
to the French King, as her ally neare&s;t at hand, to
garri&s;on the&s;e two places, which, however, &s;hould be
re&s;tored at the peace, or &s;ooner, &s;hould her Imperial Ma|je&s;ty
think proper. The &s;pirit of the Dutch merchants at
this juncture, and their &s;entiments with re&s;pect to Eng|land,
appeared with very high colouring in a memorial to
the States-General, &s;ub&s;cribed by two hundred and &s;ixty-nine
traders, compo&s;ed and pre&s;ented with equal &s;ecre&s;y
and circum&s;pection. In this famous remon&s;trance they
complained, that the violences and unju&s;t depredations
committed by the Engli&s;h &s;hips of war and privateers on
the ve&s;&s;els and effects of them and their fellow-&s;ubjects
were not only continued, but daily multiplied; and
cruelty and exce&s;s carried to &s;uch a pitch of wanton bar|barity,
that the petitioners were forced to implore the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their High Mightine&s;&s;es to protect, in the
mo&s;t efficacious manner, the commerce and navigation,
which were the two &s;inews of the republic. For this
nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;e they offered to contribute each his con|tingent,
and to arm at their own charge; and other propo|&s;itions
were made for an immediate augmentation of the
marine. While this party indu&s;triou&s;ly exerted all their
power and credit to effect a rupture with England, the
Prince&s;s Gouvernante employed all her intere&s;t and
addre&s;s to divert them from this object, and alarm them
with re&s;pect to the power and de&s;igns of France; again&s;t
which &s;he earne&s;tly exhorted them to augment their mili|tary
forces by land, that they might be prepared to defend
<PB N="268" REF="272">
them&s;elves again&s;t all inva&s;ion. At the &s;ame time, &s;h$
&s;pared no pains to adju&s;t the differences between he$
hu&s;band's country and her father's kingdom; and, with$
out doubt, her healing councils were of great efficacy i$
preventing matters from coming to a very dangerous ex$tremity.</P>

<P>&sect; I. THE whole &s;trength of Great-Britain during
this campaign was not exhau&s;ted in petty de|&s;cents
upon the coa&s;t of France. The continent of Ame|rica
was the great theatre on which her chief vigour was
di&s;played; nor did &s;he fail to exert her&s;elf in &s;ucce&s;sful
efforts again&s;t the French &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Africa.
The whole gum trade, from Cape Blanco to the river
Gambia, an extent of five hundred miles, had been en|gro&s;&s;ed
by the French, who built Fort Louis within the
mouth of the Senegal, extending their factories near three
hundred leagues up that river, and on the &s;ame coa&s;t had
fortified the i&s;land of Goree, in which they maintained a
con&s;iderable garri&s;on. The gum-&s;enega, of which a great
quantity is u&s;ed by the manufacturers of England, being
wholly in the hands of the enemy, the Engli&s;h dealers
were obliged to buy it at &s;econd hand from the Dutch,
who purcha&s;ed it of the French, and exacted an exorbitant
<PB N="271" REF="275">
price for that commodity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX.</NOTE> This con&s;ideration forwarded
the plan for annexing the country to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Great Britain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1758.</NOTE> The project was fir&s;t conceived by Mr.
Thomas Cumming, a &s;en&s;ible quaker, who, as a private
merchant, had made a voyage to Portenderrick, an adjoin|ing
part of the coa&s;t, and contracted a per&s;onal acquaint|ance
with Amir, the Moori&s;h King of Legibelli<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The names the natives give to that part of South Barbary, known to merchants and navigators by that of The Gum Coa&s;t, and called in maps The Sandy De&s;ert of Sara, and &s;ometimes Zara.</NOTE>.
He found this African prince extremely well di&s;po&s;ed to|wards
the &s;ubjects of Great Britain, whom he publickly
preferred to all other Europeans, and &s;o exa&s;perated
again&s;t the French, that he declared he &s;hould never be
ea&s;y till they were exterminated from the river Senegal.
At that very time he had commenced ho&s;tilities again&s;t
them, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired that the King of England
would &s;end out an armament to reduce Fort-Louis and
Goree, with &s;ome &s;hips of force to protect the traders. In
that ca&s;e, he promi&s;ed to join his Britannick maje&s;ty's
forces, and grant an exclu&s;ive trade to his &s;ubjects. Mr.
Cumming not only perceived the advantages that would
re&s;ult from &s;uch an exclu&s;ive privilege with regard to the
gum, but fore&s;aw many other important con&s;equences of
an exten&s;ive trade in a country, which, over and above the
gum-&s;enega, contains many valuable articles, &s;uch as
gold-du&s;t, elephants teeth, hides, cotton, bees-wax,
&s;laves, o&s;trich feathers, indigo, ambergris, and civet.
Elevated with the pro&s;pect of an acqui&s;ition &s;o valuable
to his country, this hone&s;t quaker was equally minute and
indefatigable in his enquiries touching the commerce of
the coa&s;t, as well as the &s;trength and &s;ituation of the French
&s;ettlements on the river Senegal; and, at his return to
England, actually formed the plan of an expedition for the
conque&s;t of Fort-Louis. This was pre&s;ented to the board
of trade, by whom it was approved, after a &s;evere exami|nation;
but it required the patriotic zeal and invincible
per&s;everance of Cumming to &s;urmount a variety of ob&s;ta|cles
<PB N="272" REF="276">
before it was adopted by the mini&s;try; and even the$
it was not executed in its full extent. He was abridge$
of one large &s;hip, and in lieu of &s;ix hundred land forces
to be drafted from different regiments, which he i$
vain demanded, fir&s;t from the Duke of Cumberland, an$
afterwards from Lord Ligonier, the lords of the Admisralty
allotted two hundred marines only for this &s;ervice
After repeated &s;ollicitations he, in the year one thou&s;an$
&s;even hundred and fifty-&s;even, obtained an order, that th$
two annual &s;hips bound to the coa&s;t of Guinea &s;hould b$
joined by a &s;loop and two bu&s;&s;es, and make an attemp
upon the French &s;ettlement in the river Senegal. The&s;$
&s;hips, however, were detained by contrary winds until th$
&s;ea&s;on was too far advanced to admit a probability of &s;uc$ce&s;s,
and therefore the de&s;ign was po&s;tponed. In th$
beginning of the pre&s;ent year, Mr. Cumming being re-enforced
with the intere&s;t of a con&s;iderable merchant i$
the city, to whom he had communicated the plan, renewe$
his application to the mini&s;try, and they re&s;olved to hazar$
the enterpri&s;e. A &s;mall &s;quadron was equipped for thi$
expedition, under the command of Captain Mar&s;h, having
on board a body of marines, commanded by Major Ma&s;on
with a detachment of artillery, ten pieces of cannon, eight
mortars, and a con&s;iderable quantity of warlike &s;tores and
ammunition. Captain Walker was appointed engineer
and Mr. Cumming was concerned as a principal director
and promoter of the expedition<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">On this occa&s;ion Mr. Cumming may &s;eem to have acted directly contrary to the tenets of his religious profe&s;&s;ion; but he ever declared to the mini&s;try that he was fully per&s;uaded his &s;chemes might be accompli&s;hed without th$ effu&s;ion of human blood; and that if he thought otherwi&s;e, he would by $word$ means have concerned him&s;elf about them. He al&s;o de&s;ired, let the con&s;e|quence be what it might, his brethren &s;hould not be chargeable with wha$ was his own &s;ingle act.&mdash;If it was the fir&s;t military &s;cheme of any Quaker, le$ it be remembered it was al&s;o the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful expedition of this war, and one of the fir&s;t that ever was carried on according to the pacifick &s;y&s;tem o$ the Quakers, without the lo&s;s of a drop of blood on either &s;ide.</NOTE>. This little armament
&s;ailed in the beginning of March; and in their pa&s;&s;age
touched at the i&s;land Teneri&s;&s;e, where, while the &s;hips
<PB N="273" REF="277">
&s;upplied them&s;elves with wine and water, Mr. Cumming
proceeded in the Swan &s;loop to Portenderrick, being
charged with a letter of credence to his old friend the king
of that country, who had favoured him in his la&s;t vi&s;it with
an exclu&s;ive trade on that coa&s;t, by a formal charter,
written in the Arabick language. This prince was now up
the country, engaged in a war with his neighbours, called
the Diable-Moors<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This is the name by which the &s;ubjects of Legibelli di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e of Brackna, who inhabit the country farther up the river Senegal, and are in con&s;tant alliance with the French.</NOTE>; and the Queen-Dowager, who re|mained
at Portenderrick, gave Mr. Cumming to under|&s;tand,
that &s;he could not at pre&s;ent &s;pare any troops to
join the Engli&s;h in their expedition again&s;t Senegal: but
&s;he a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;hould the French be exterminated,
&s;he and her &s;ubjects would go thither and &s;ettle. In the
mean time, one of the chiefs, called Prince Amir, di|&s;patched
a me&s;&s;enger to the King, with advice of their ar|rival
and de&s;ign. He declared that he would, with all
po&s;&s;ible diligence, a&s;&s;emble three hundred warriors to join
the Engli&s;h troops, and that, in his opinion, the King
would re-enforce them with a detachment from his army.
By this time Captain Mar&s;h, with the re&s;t of the arma|ment,
had arrived at Portenderrick, and fearing that the
enemy might receive intimation of his de&s;ign, re&s;olved to
proceed on the expedition, without waiting for the pro|mi&s;ed
auxiliaries. On the twenty-&s;econd day of April he
weighed anchor, and next day, at four o'clock, di&s;covered
the French flag &s;lying upon Fort-Louis, &s;ituated in the
mid&s;t of a pretty con&s;iderable town, which exhibited a
very agreeable appearance. The Commodore having made
prize of a Dutch &s;hip richly laden with gum, which lay
at anchor without the bar, came to anchor in Senegal-road,
at the mouth of the river; and here he perceived
&s;everal armed &s;loops which the enemy had detached to de|fend
the pa&s;&s;age of the bar, which is extremely dangerous.
All the boa&s;ts were employed in conveying the &s;tores into
the &s;mall craft, while three of the &s;loops continued ex|changing
<PB N="274" REF="278">
fire over a narrow tongue of land with the ve&s;|&s;els
of the enemy, con&s;i&s;ting of one brig and &s;ix armed
&s;loops, mounted with great guns and &s;wivels. At length,
the channel being di&s;covered, and the wind, which ge|nerally
blows down the river, chopping about, Captain
Millar, of the London Bu&s;s, &s;ei&s;ed that opportunity; and
pa&s;&s;ing the bar with a flowing &s;heet, dropped anchor on
the in&s;ide, where he lay till night, expo&s;ed to the whole
fire of the enemy. Next day he was joined by the other
&s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and a regular engagement en&s;ued. This
was warmly maintained on both &s;ides, until the bu&s;&s;es
and one dogger running a-ground, immediately bulged,
and were filled with water. Then the troops they con|tained
took to their boats, and with &s;ome difficulty reached
the &s;hore, where they formed in a body, and were &s;oon
joined by their companions from the other ve&s;&s;els; &s;o
that now the whole amounted to three hundred and ninety
marines, be&s;ides the detachment of artillery. As they
laid their account with being attacked by the natives, who
lined the &s;hore at &s;ome di&s;tance, &s;eemingly determined to
oppo&s;e the de&s;cent, they forthwith threw up an entrench|ment,
and began to di&s;embark the &s;tores, great part of
which lay under water. While they were employed in
rai&s;ing this occa&s;ional defence, the negroes came in great
numbers and &s;ubmitted; and on the &s;ucceeding day they
were re-enforced by three hundred and fifty &s;eamen, who
pa&s;&s;ed the bar in &s;loops, with their en&s;igns and colours
flying.</P>
<P>&sect; II. They had made no further progre&s;s in their opera|tions,
when two French deputies arrived at the entrench|ment,
with propo&s;als for a capitulation from the governour
of Fort-Louis. After &s;ome he&s;itation, Captain Mar&s;h and
Major Ma&s;on agreed, That all the white people belonging
to the French company at Senegal &s;hould be &s;afely con|ducted
to France in an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, without being de|prived
of their private effects, provided all the merchan|di&s;e
and uncoined trea&s;ure &s;hould be delivered up to the
<PB N="275" REF="279">
victors; and that all the forts, &s;tore-hou&s;es, ve&s;&s;els, arms,
provi&s;ions, and every article belonging to the company
in that river &s;hould be put into the hands of the Engli&s;h
immediately after the capitulation could be &s;igned. They
promi&s;ed that the free natives living at Fort-Louis &s;hould
remain in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their effects, and in the free
exerci&s;e of their religion; and that all negroes, mulattoes,
and others, who could prove them&s;elves free, &s;hould have
it in their option either to remain in the place, or remove
to any other part of the country<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The victors, however, committed a very great mi&s;take in allowing them to carry off their books and accounts, the peru&s;al of which would have been of insinite &s;ervice to the Engli&s;h merchants, by informing them of the com|modities, their value, the proper &s;ea&s;ons, and methods of pro&s;ecuting the trade.</NOTE>. The Captains Camp|bell
and Walker were immediately &s;ent up the river with a
flag of truce, to &s;ee the articles &s;igned and executed; but
they were &s;o retarded by the rapidity of the &s;tream, that
they did not approach the fort till three in the morning.
As &s;oon as the day broke they hoi&s;ted their flag, and rowed
up towards a battery on a point of the i&s;land, where they
lay upon their oars very near a full hour, beating the cha|made;
but no notice was taken of their approach. This
re&s;erve appearing my&s;terious, they retired down the river
to their entrenchment, where they under&s;tood that the
negroes on the i&s;land were in arms, and had blocked up
the French in Fort-Louis, re&s;olving to defend the place to
the la&s;t extremity, unle&s;s they &s;hould be included in the
capitulation. This intelligence was communicated in a
&s;econd letter from the governor, who likewi&s;e informed
the Engli&s;h commander, that unle&s;s the French director-general
&s;hould be permitted to remain with the natives, as
a &s;urety for that article of the capitulation in which they
were concerned, they would allow them&s;elves to be cut in
pieces rather than &s;ubmit. This reque&s;t being granted,
the Engli&s;h forces began their march to Fort-Louis, ac|companied
by a number of long boats, in which the artil|lery
and &s;tores had been embarked. The French &s;eeing
them advance immediately &s;truck their flag: and Major
<PB N="276" REF="280">
Ma&s;on took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle, where he found ninety-two
pieces of cannon, with trea&s;ure and merchandi&s;e to a
con&s;iderable value. The corporation and burghers of the
town of Senegal &s;ubmitted, and &s;wore allegiance to his
Britannick Maje&s;ty: the neighbouring princes, attended
by numerous retinues, vi&s;ited the commander, and con|cluded
treaties with the Engli&s;h nation, and the King of
Portenderrick, or Legibelli, &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador from his
camp to Major Ma&s;on, with pre&s;ents, compliments of con|gratulation,
and a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip. The number
of free independent Negroes and Mulattoes &s;ettled at
Senegal amounted to three thou&s;and, and many of the&s;e
enjoyed &s;laves and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of their own. The two
French factories of Podore and Galam, the latter &s;ituated
nine hundred miles farther up the river, were included in
the capitulation; &s;o that Great Britain, almo&s;t without
&s;triking a blow, found her&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a conque&s;t,
from which, with proper management, &s;he may derive in|conceivable
riches. This important acqui&s;ition was in a
great mea&s;ure, if not entirely, owing to the &s;agacity, zeal,
and indefatigable efforts of Mr. Cumming, who not only
formed the plan, and &s;ollicited the armament, but al&s;o at|tended
the execution of it in per&s;on, at the hazard of his
life, and to the interruption of his private concerns.</P>
<P>&sect; III. Fort-Louis being &s;ecured with an Engli&s;h gar|ri&s;on,
and &s;ome armed ve&s;&s;els left to guard the pa&s;&s;age of the
bar, at the mouth of the river, the great &s;hips proceeded to
make an attempt upon the i&s;land of Goree, which lies at
the di&s;tance of thirty leagues from Senegal. There the
French company had con&s;iderable magazines and ware-hou&s;es,
and lodged the negro &s;laves until they could be
&s;hipped for the We&s;t-Indies. If the additional force which
Mr. Cumming propo&s;ed for the conque&s;t of this i&s;land
had been added to the armament, in all probability the
i&s;land would have been reduced, and in that ca&s;e, the na|tion
would have &s;aved the con&s;iderable expen&s;e of a &s;ub&s;e|quent
expedition again&s;t it, under the conduct of Commo|dore
<PB N="277" REF="281">
Keppel. At pre&s;ent, the &s;hips by which Go|ree
was attacked were found unequal to the attempt,
and the expedition mi&s;carried accordingly, though the
mi&s;carriage was attended with little or no damage to the
a&s;&s;ailants.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. Scenes of &s;till greater importance were acted in
North-America, where, exclu&s;ive of the fleet and marines,
the government had a&s;&s;embled about fifty thou&s;and men,
including two-and-twenty thou&s;and regular troops. The
Earl of Loudoun having returned to England, the chief
command in America devolved on Major-General Aber|crombie;
but as the objects of operation were various, the
forces were divided into three detached bodies, under as
many different commanders. About twelve thou&s;and were
de&s;tined to undertake the &s;iege of Loui&s;bourg, on the i&s;land
of Cape-Breton. The general him&s;elf re&s;erved near &s;ixteen
thou&s;and for the reduction of Crown-Point, a fort &s;ituated
on lake Champlain: eight thou&s;and, under the conduct of
Brigadier-General Forbes, were allotted for the conque&s;t
of Fort du Que&s;ne, which &s;tood a great way to the &s;outh|ward,
near the river Ohio; and a con&s;iderable garri&s;on
was left at Annapolis, in Nova-Scotia. The reduction of
Loui&s;bourg and the i&s;land of Cape-Breton being an object
of immediate con&s;ideration, was undertaken with all
po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. Major-General Amher&s;t being joined
by Admiral Bo&s;cawen, with the fleet and forces from Eng|land,
the whole armament, con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred and
fifty-&s;even &s;ail, took their departure from the harbour of
Hali&s;ax, in Nova-Scotia, on the twenty-eighth of May,
and on the &s;econd of June part of the tran&s;ports anchored
in the bay of Gabarus, about &s;even miles to the we&s;tward
of Loui&s;bourg. The garri&s;on of this place, commanded
by the Chevalier Drucour, con&s;i&s;ted of two thou&s;and five
hundred regular troops, three hundred militia, formed of
the burghers, and towards the end of the &s;iege they were
re-enforced by three hundred and fifty Canadians, in|cluding
three &s;core Indians. The harbour was &s;ecured
<PB N="278" REF="282">
by &s;ix &s;hips of the line<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Prudent, of &s;eventy-four guns; the Entreprenant, of &s;eventy-four guns; the Capricieux, Celebre, and Bien&s;ai&s;ant, of &s;ixty-four guns each; the Apollo, of fifty guns; the Chevre, Biche, Fidelle, Diana, and Echo frigates.</NOTE>, and five frigates, three of which
the enemy &s;unk acro&s;s the harbour's mouth, in order to
render it inacce&s;&s;ible to the Engli&s;h &s;hipping. The forti|fications
were in bad repair, many parts of them crumb|ling
down the covered way, and &s;everal ba&s;tions expo&s;ed in
&s;uch a manner as to be enfiladed by the be&s;iegers, and no
part of the town &s;ecure from the effects of cannonading
and bombardment. The governor had taken all the
precautions in his power t$ prevent a landing, by e&s;tabli&s;h|ing
a chain of po&s;ts, that extended two leagues and a half
along the mo&s;t acce&s;&s;ible parts of the beach: entrench|ments
being thrown up, and batteries erected; but
there were &s;ome intermediate places which could not be
properly &s;ecured, and in one of the&s;e the Engli&s;h troops
were di&s;embarked, The di&s;po&s;ition being made for land|ing,
a detachment, in &s;everal &s;loops, under convoy, pa&s;&s;ed
by the mouth of the harbour towards Lorembec, in order
to draw the enemy's attention that way, while the landing
&s;hould really be effected on the other &s;ide of the town.
On the eighth day of June, the troops being a&s;&s;embled in
the boats before day-break, in three divi&s;ions, &s;everal
&s;loops and frigates, that were &s;tationed along &s;hore in the
bay of Gabarus, began to &s;cour the beach with their &s;hot;
and after the fire had continued about a quarter of an hour,
the boats, containing the divi&s;ion on the left, were rowed
towards the &s;hore, under the command of Brigadier-Ge|neral
Wolfe, an accompli&s;hed officer, who, in the &s;equel,
di&s;played very extraordinary proofs of military genius. At
the &s;ame time the two other divi&s;ions, on the right and in
the centre, commanded by the Brigadiers Whitmore and
Laurence, made a &s;how of landing, in order to divide and
di&s;tract the enemy. Notwith&s;tanding an impetuous &s;urf,
by which many boats were over&s;et, and a very &s;evere fire of
cannon and mu&s;ketry from the enemy's batteries, which
<PB N="279" REF="283">
did con&s;iderable execution, Brigadier Wolfe pur&s;ued his
point with admirable courage and deliberation. The &s;ol|diers
leaped into the water with the mo&s;t eager alacrity,
and, gaining the &s;hore, attacked the enemy in &s;uch a man|ner,
that in a few minutes they abandoned their works and
artillery, and fled in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. The other
divi&s;ions landed al&s;o, but not without an ob&s;tinate oppo|&s;ition;
and the &s;tores, with the artillery, being brought
on &s;hore, the town of Loui&s;bourg was formally inve&s;ted.
The difficulty of landing &s;tores and implements in boi&s;ter|ous
weather, and the nature of the ground, which, being
mar&s;hy, was unfit for the conveyance of heavy cannon, re|tarded
the operations of the &s;iege. Mr. Amher&s;t made
his approaches with great circum&s;pection, &s;ecuring his
camp with redoubts and epaulements from any attacks of
Canadians, of which he imagined there was a con&s;iderable
body behind him on the i&s;land, as well as from the fire of
the French &s;hipping in the harbour, which would other|wi&s;e
have annoyed him extremely in his advances.</P>
<P>&sect; V. The governor of Loui&s;bourg having de&s;troyed
the grand battery, which was detached from the body of
the place, and recalled his out-po&s;ts, prepared for making
a vigorous defence. A very &s;evere fire, well directed, was
maintained again&s;t the be&s;iegers and their works, from the
town, the i&s;land battery, and the &s;hips in the harbour;
and divers &s;allies were made, though without much effect.
In the mean time Brigadier Wolfe, with a &s;trong detach|ment,
had marched round the north-ea&s;t part of the har|bour,
and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lighthou&s;e-point, where
he erected &s;everal batteries again&s;t the &s;hips and the i&s;land
fortification, which la&s;t was &s;oon &s;ilenced. On the nine|teenth
day of June the Echo, a French frigate, was taken
by the Engli&s;h crui&s;ers, after having e&s;caped from the har|bour:
from the officers on board of this &s;hip the Admiral
learned that the Bizarre, another frigate, had &s;ailed from
thence on the day of the di&s;embarkation, and the Comete
had &s;ucce&s;sfully followed her example. Be&s;ides the regu|lar
approaches to the town, conducted by the engineers
<PB N="280" REF="284">
under the immediate command and in&s;pection of General
Amher&s;t, divers batteries were rai&s;ed by the detached corps
under Brigadier Wolfe, who exerted him&s;elf with amazing
activity, and grievou&s;ly incommoded the enemy, both of the
town and the &s;hipping. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of July
the three great &s;hips, the Ent$eprenant, Capricieux, and
Celebre, were &s;et on fire by a bomb-&s;hell, and burned to
a&s;hes, &s;o that none remained but the Prudent and Bien|fai&s;ant,
which the Admiral undertook to de&s;troy. For
this purpo&s;e, in the night between the twenty-fifth and
twenty-&s;ixth days of the month, the boats of the &s;quadron
were in two divi&s;ions detached into the harbour, under
the command of two young captains, Laforey and Bal|four.
They accordingly penetrated, in the dark, through
a terrible fire of cannon and mu&s;quetry, and boarded the
enemy &s;word in hand. The Prudent, being a-ground, was
&s;et on fire, and de&s;troyed, but the Bienfai&s;ant was towed
out of the harbour in triumph. In the pro&s;ecution of the
&s;iege, the admiral and general co-operated with remarkable
harmony; the former chearfully a&s;&s;i&s;ting the latter with
cannon and other implements; with detachments of ma|rines
to maintain po&s;ts on &s;hore, with parties of &s;eamen to
act as pioneers, and concur in working the guns and mor|tars.
The fire of the town was managed with equal &s;kill
and activity, and kept up with great per&s;everance; until
at length, their &s;hipping being all taken or de&s;troyed, the
ca&s;erns<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that a cavalier, which Admiral K&mdash;had built at an enormous expen&s;e to the nation, while Loui&s;bourg remained in the hands of the Engli&s;h in the la&s;t war, was, in the cour&s;e of this &s;iege, entirely demoli&s;hed by two or three &s;hots from one of the Briti&s;h batteries; &s;o admirably had this piece of fortification been contrived and executed, under the eye of that profound engineer.</NOTE> ruined in the two principal ba&s;tions, forty out of
fifty two pieces of cannon di&s;mounted, broke, or ren|dered
un&s;erviceable, and divers practicable breaches ef|fected,
the governour, in a letter to Mr. Amher&s;t, pro|po&s;ed
a capitulation on the &s;ame articles that were granted
to the Engli&s;h at Port-Mahon. In an&s;wer to this pro|po&s;al
he was given to under&s;tand, that he and his garri&s;on
<PB N="281" REF="285">
mu&s;t &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, otherwi&s;e he
might next morning expect a general a&s;&s;ault by the &s;hip|ping
under Admiral Bo&s;cawen. The Chevalier Dru|cour,
piqued at the &s;everity of the&s;e terms, replied, that
he would, rather than comply with them, &s;tand an a&s;&s;ault;
but the commi&s;&s;ary-general, and intendant of the colony,
pre&s;ented a petition from the traders and inhabitants of the
place, in con&s;equen&s;e of which he &s;ubmitted. On the
twenty-&s;eventh day of July three companies of grenadiers,
commanded by Major Farquhar, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
we&s;tern gate; and Brigadier Whitmore was detached into
the town, to &s;ee the garri&s;on lay down their arms and de|liver
up their colours on the e&s;planade, and to po&s;t the
nece&s;&s;ary guards on the &s;tores, magazines, and ramparts.
Thus, at the expence of about four hundred men killed
and wounded, the Engli&s;h obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the im|portant
i&s;land of Cape-Breton, and the &s;trong town of
Loui&s;bourg, in which the victors found two hundred and
twenty-one pieces of cannon, with eighteen mortars, and
a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;tores and ammunition. The
merchants and inhabitants were &s;ent to France in Engli&s;h
bottoms, but the garri&s;on, together with the &s;ea-officers,
marines, and mariners, amounting in all to five thou&s;and
&s;ix hundred and thirty-&s;even pri&s;oners, were tran&s;ported to
England. The lo&s;s of Loui&s;bourg was the more &s;everely
felt by the French King, as it had been attended with
the de&s;truction of &s;o many con&s;iderable &s;hips and frigates.
The particulars of this tran&s;action were immediately
brought to England, in a ve&s;&s;el di&s;patched for that pur|po&s;e,
with Captain Amher&s;t, brother to the commander,
who was al&s;o entru&s;ted with eleven pair of colours taken
at Loui&s;bourg: the&s;e were, by his Maje&s;ty's order, car|ried
in pompous parade, e&s;corted by detachments of hor&s;e
and foot guards, with kettle-drums and trumpets, from
the palace of Ken&s;ington to St. Paul's cathedral, where
they were depo&s;ited as trophies, under a di&s;charge of can|non,
and other noi&s;y expre&s;&s;ions of $riumph and exulta|tion.
Indeed, the publick rejoicings for the conque&s;t of
<PB N="282" REF="286">
Loui&s;bourg were diffu&s;ed through every part of the Briti&s;h
dominions, and addre&s;&s;es of congratulation were pre+&s;ented
to the King by a great number of flouri&s;hing town
and corporations.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. After the reduction of Cape-Breton, &s;ome &s;hip
were detached, with a body of troops under the comman$
of Lieutenant Colonel Lord Rollo, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion o$
the i&s;land of St. John, which al&s;o lies in the gulf of St
Laurence, and, by its fertility in corn and cattle, had &s;inc$
the beginning of the war &s;upplied Quebeck with con$&s;iderable
quantities of provi&s;ion. It was likewi&s;e th$
a&s;ylum to which the French neutrals of Annapolis fle$
for &s;helter from the Engli&s;h government; and the retrea$
from whence they and the Indians u&s;ed to make thei$
&s;udden irruptions into Nova-Scotia, where they perpe
trated the mo&s;t inhuman barbarities on the defencele&s;s &s;ub$jects
of Great Britain. The number of inhabitant
amounted to four thou&s;and one hundred, who &s;ubmitted
and brought in their arms: then Lord Rollo took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the governour's quarters, where he found &s;everal &s;calp
of Engli&s;hmen, whom the &s;avages had a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, i$
con&s;equence of the encouragement they received from their
French patrons and allies, who gratified them with $
certain premium for every &s;calp they produced. The i&s;land
was &s;tocked with above ten thou&s;and head of black cattle
and &s;ome of the farmers rai&s;ed each twelve hundred
bu&s;hels of corn annually for the market of Quebeck.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The joy and &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing from the conque&s;t
of Loui&s;bourg and St. John was not a little checked by
the di&s;a&s;ter which befel the main body of the Briti&s;h forces
in America, under the immediate conduct of General
Abercrombie, who, as we have already ob&s;erved, had
propo&s;ed the reduction of the French forts on the lakes
George and Champlain, as the chief objects of his enter|pri&s;e,
with a view to &s;ecure the frontier of the Briti&s;h
colonies, and open a pa&s;&s;age for the future conque&s;t of
Canada. In the beginning of July his forces, amount|ing
to near &s;even thou&s;and regular troops, and ten thou|&s;and
<PB N="283" REF="287">
provincials, embarked on the lake George, in the
neighbourhood of Lake Champlain, on board of nine
hundred batteaus, and one hundred and thirty-five whale-boats,
with provi&s;ion, artillery, and ammunition; &s;everal
pieces of cannon being mounted on rafts to cover the
purpo&s;ed landing, which was next day effected without
oppo&s;ition. The general's de&s;ign was to inve&s;t Ticon|deroga,
a fort &s;ituated on a tongue of land, extending
between Lake George and a narrow gut that communi|cates
with Lake Champlain. This fortification was, on
three &s;ides, &s;urrounded with water, and in front nature
had &s;ecured it with a mora&s;s. The Engli&s;h troops being
di&s;embarked, were immediately formed into three columns,
and began their march to the enemy's advanced po&s;t,
con&s;i&s;ting of one battalion, encamped behind a brea&s;t|work
of logs, which they now abandoned with precipi|tation,
after having &s;et them on fire, and burned their
tents and implements. The Briti&s;h forces continued their
march in the &s;ame order; but the route lying through a
thick wood that did not admit of any regular progre&s;&s;ion
or pa&s;&s;age, and the guides proving extremely ignorant, the
troops were bewildered, and the columns broken by falling
in one upon another. Lord Howe being advanced at the
head of the right centre column, encountered a French
detachment who had likewi&s;e lo&s;t their way in the retreat
from the advanced po&s;t, and a warm &s;kirmi&s;h en&s;uing, the
enemy were routed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, a good number
were killed, and one hundred and forty-eight were taken
pri&s;oners, including five officers. This petty advantage
was dearly bought with the lo&s;s of Lord Howe, who fell
in the beginning of the action, un&s;peakably regretted as a
young nobleman of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing talents, who had
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in a peculiar manner by his courage,
activity, and rigid ob&s;ervation of military di&s;cipline, and
had acquired the e&s;teem and affection of the &s;oldiery by
his genero&s;ity, &s;weetne&s;s of manners, and engaging ad|dre&s;s.
The general perceiving the troops were greatly
$atigued and di&s;ordered from want of re&s;t and refre&s;hment,
<PB N="284" REF="288">
thought it advi&s;eable to march back to the landing place,
which they reached about eight in the morning. Then
he detached Lieutenant-Colonel Brad&s;treet, with one
regular regiment, &s;ix companies of the Royal Americans,
with the batteau-men, and a body of rangers, to take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;aw-mill in the neighbourhood of Ticon|deroga,
which the enemy had abandoned. This po&s;t being
&s;ecured, the general advanced again towards Ticonderoga,
where he under&s;tood from the pri&s;oners the enemy had
a&s;&s;embled eight battalions, with a body of Canadians and
Indians, amounting in all to &s;ix thou&s;and. The&s;e, they
&s;aid, being encamped before the fort, were employed in
making a formidable entrenchment, where they intended
to wait for a re-enforcement of three thou&s;and men, who
had been detached under the command of M. de Levi, to
make a diver&s;ion on the &s;ide of the Mohawk river<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This officer intended to have made an irruption through the pa&s;s of O$$$ida on the Mohawk$ river, but was recalled before he could execute his de&s;ign. General Abercrombie afterwards &s;ent thither Brigadier Stanwir, with a con&s;iderable body of Provincials: and this important pa&s;s was &s;e|cured by a fort built at that juncture.</NOTE>; but
upon intelligence of Mr. Abercrombie's approach, were
now recalled for the defence of Ticonderoga. This in|formation
determined the Engli&s;h general to &s;trike, if
po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome deci&s;ive &s;troke before the junction could be
effected. He, therefore, early next morning &s;ent his
engineer acro&s;s the river on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the fort,
to reconnoitre the enemy's entrenchments, and he reported,
that the works being &s;till unfini&s;hed, might be attempted
with a good pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. A di&s;po&s;ition was made
accordingly for the attack, and after proper guards had
been left at the &s;aw mill and the landing-place, the whole
army was put in motion. They advanced with great
alacrity towards the entrenchment, which, however,
they &s;ound altogether impracticable. The brea&s;t-work
was rai&s;ed eight feet high, and the ground before it covered
with an abbattis, or felled trees, with their boughs point|ing
outwards, and projecting in &s;uch a manner as to render
the entrenchment almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible. Notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="285" REF="289">
the&s;e di&s;couraging difficulties, the Briti&s;h troops marched
up to the a&s;&s;ault with an undaunted re&s;olution, and &s;u&s;|tained
a terrible fire without flinch&iuml;ng. They endeavour|ed
to cut their way through the&s;e embarra&s;ments with
their &s;words, and &s;ome of them even mounted the para|pet;
but the enemy were &s;o well covered, that they could
deliberately direct their fire without the lea&s;t danger to
them&s;elves: the carnage was therefore con&s;iderable, and
the troops began to fall into confu&s;ion, after &s;everal re|peated
attacks, which la&s;ted above four hours, under the
mo&s;t di&s;advantageous circum&s;tances. The general, by
this time, &s;aw plainly that no hope of &s;ucce&s;s remained;
and, in order to prevent a total defeat, took mea&s;ures for
the retreat of the army, which retired unmole&s;ted to their
former camp, with the lo&s;s of about eighteen hundred
men killed or wounded, including a great number of offi|cers.
Every corps of regular troops behaved, on this un|fortunate
occa&s;ion, with remarkable intrepidity, but the
greate&s;t lo&s;s was &s;u&s;tained by Lord John Murray's High|land
regiment, of which above one half of the private men,
and twenty-five officers, were either &s;lain upon the &s;pot,
or de&s;perately wounded. Mr. Abercrombie, unwilling to
&s;tay in the neighbourhood of the enemy with $orces which
had received &s;uch a di&s;piriting check, retired to his bat|teaus,
and re-embarking the troops, returned to the camp
at Lake-George, from whence he had taken his depar|ture.
Cen&s;ure, which always attends mi&s;carriage, did not
&s;pare the character of this commander; his attack was
condemned as ra&s;h, and his retreat as pu&s;illanimous. In
&s;uch ca&s;es, allowance mu&s;t be made for the peevi&s;hne&s;s of
di&s;appointment, and the clamour of connexion. How
far Mr. Abercrombie acquitted him&s;elf in the duty of a
general we &s;hall not pretend to determine; but if he could
depend upon the courage and di&s;cipline of his forces, he
&s;urely had nothing to fear, after the action, from the
attempts of the enemy, to whom he would have been &s;u|perior
in number, even though they had been joined by the
expected re-enforcement: he might, therefore, have re|mained
<PB N="286" REF="290">
on the &s;pot, in order to execute &s;ome other enter|pri&s;e
when he &s;hould be re-enforced in his turn; for
General Amher&s;t no &s;ooner heard of his di&s;a&s;ter than he
returned with the troops from Cape-Breton to New Eng|land,
after having left a &s;trong garri&s;on in Loui&s;bourg.
At the head of &s;ix regiments he began his march to Al|bany,
about the middle of September, in order to join the
forces on the lake, that they might undertake &s;ome other
&s;ervice before the &s;ea&s;on &s;hould be exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. In the mean time, General Abercrombie had
detached Lieutenant-Colonel Brad&s;treet, with a body of
three thou&s;and men, chiefly Provincials, to execute a plan
which this officer had formed again&s;t Cadaraqui, or Fort-Frontenac,
&s;ituated on the north &s;ide of the river St. Lau|rence,
ju&s;t where it takes its origin from the Lake On|tario.
To the &s;ide of this lake he penetrated with his
detachment, and embarking in &s;ome &s;loops and batteaus,
provided for the purpo&s;e, landed within a mile of Fort-Frontenac,
the garri&s;on of which, con&s;i&s;ting of one hun|dred
and ten men, with a few Indians, immediately &s;ur|rendered
at di&s;cretion. Con&s;idering the importance of
this po&s;t, which, in a great mea&s;ure, commanded the mouth
of the river St. Laurence, and &s;erved as a magazine to the
more &s;outhern ca&s;tles, the French general was inexcu&s;eable
for leaving it in &s;uch a defencele&s;s condition. The forti|fication
it&s;elf was incon&s;iderable and ill contived; never|thele&s;s,
it contained &s;ixty pieces of cannon, &s;ixteen &s;mall
mortars, with an immen&s;e quantity of merchandi&s;e and
provi&s;ions, depo&s;ited for the u&s;e of the French forces de|tached
again&s;t Brigadier Forbes, their we&s;tern garri&s;ons,
and Indian allies, as well as for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the corps
commanded by M. de Levi, on his enterpri&s;e again&s;t the
Mohawk river. Mr. Brad&s;treet not only reduced the fort
without blood&s;hed, but al&s;o made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all the
enemy's &s;hipping on the lake, amounting to nine armed
ve&s;&s;els, &s;ome of which carried eighteen guns. Two of
the&s;e Mr. Brad&s;treet conveyed to O&s;wego, whither he
returned with his troops, after he had de&s;troyed Fort-Frontenac,
<PB N="287" REF="291">
with all the artillery, &s;tores, provi&s;ion, and
merchandize which it contained. In con&s;equence of this
exploit, the French troops to the &s;outhward were expo&s;ed
to the hazard of &s;tarving; but it is not ea&s;y to conceive the
general's rea&s;on for giving orders to abandon and de&s;troy a
fort, which, if properly &s;trengthened and &s;u&s;tained, might
have rendered the Engli&s;h ma&s;ters of the Lake Ontario,
and grievou&s;ly harra&s;&s;ed the enemy, both in their com|merce,
and expeditions to the we&s;tward. Indeed, great
part of the Indian trade centered at Frontenac, to which
place the Indians annually repaired from all parts of America,
&s;ome of them at the di&s;tance of a thou&s;and miles, and here
exchanged their furs for European commodities. So
much did the French traders excel the Engli&s;h in the art
of conciliating the affection of tho&s;e &s;avage tribes, that
great part of them, in their yearly progre&s;s to this remote
market, actually pa&s;&s;ed by the Briti&s;h &s;ettlement of Al|bany,
in New-York, where they might have been &s;upplied
with what articles they wanted much more cheap than
they could purcha&s;e them at Frontenac or Montreal: nay,
the French traders u&s;ed to furni&s;h them&s;elves with the&s;e
$very commodities from the merchants of New-York, and
$ound this traffick much more profitable than that of pro|curing
the &s;ame articles from France, loaded with the
expence of a tedious and dangerous navigation, from the
$$a to the &s;ource of the river St. Laurence.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. In all probability, the de&s;truction of Frontenac
$acilitated the expedition again&s;t Fort du Que&s;ne, entru&s;ted
$o the conduct of Brigadier Forbes, who, with his little
$rmy, began his march in the beginning of July from
Philadelphia for the river Ohio, a prodigious tract of coun|$ry
very little known, de&s;titute of military roads, incum|$ered
with mountains, mora&s;&s;es, and woods, that were
$lmo&s;t impenetrable. It was not without incredible ex|$rtion
of indu&s;try that he procured provi&s;ions and car|$iages
for this expedition, formed new roads, extended
$$couting parties, &s;ecured cams, and &s;urmounted many
$ther difficulties in the cour&s;e of his tedious march, during
<PB N="288" REF="292">
which he was al&s;o harra&s;&s;ed by &s;mall detachments of the
enemy's Indians. Having penetrated with the main body
as far as Ray's-Town, at the di&s;tance of ninety miles
from Fort du Que&s;ne, and advanced Colonel Bouquet,
with two thou&s;and men, about fifty miles farther, to a place
called Lyal-Henning, this officer detached Major Grant,
at the head of eight hundred men, to reconnoitre the for$
and its out-works. The enemy perceiving him approach&punc;
&s;ent a body of troops again&s;t him, &s;ufficient to &s;urround his
whole detachment: a very &s;evere action began, which the
Engli&s;h maintained with their u&s;ual courage for three
hours, again&s;t cruel odds; but at length, being overpowere$
by numbers, they were obliged to give way, and retire$
in di&s;order to Lyal-Henning, with the lo&s;s of about three
hundred men killed or taken, including Major Grant, who
was carried pri&s;oner to Fort du Que&s;ne, and nineteen
officers. Notwith&s;tanding this mortifying check, Briga$dier
Forbes advanced with the army, re&s;olved to pro&s;ecut$
his operations with vigour; but the enemy, dreading th$
pro&s;pect of a &s;iege, di&s;mantled and abandoned the fort$
and retired down the river Ohio, to their &s;ettlements o$
the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. They quitted the fort on the twenty
$fourth day of November, and next day it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed b$
the Briti&s;h forces. As for the Indians of this country$
they &s;eemed heartily to renounce their connexions wit$
France, and be perfectly reconciled to the government o$
his Britannick Maje&s;ty. Brigadier Forbes having re|paired
the fort, changed its name from Du Que&s;ne $word$
Pitt&s;burgh, &s;ecured it with a garri&s;on of provincials, an$
concluded treaties of friend&s;hip and alliance with the In+dian
tribes. Then he marched back to Philadelphia, an$
in his retreat built a blockhou&s;e, near Lyal-Henning, $word$;
the defence of Penn&s;ylvania; but he him&s;elf did not lon$
&s;urvive the&s;e tran&s;actions, his con&s;titution having bee$
exhau&s;ted by the incredible fatigues of the &s;ervice. Th$$
have we given a particular detail of all the remarkabl$
operations by which this campaign was di&s;tingui&s;hed o$
the continent of America: the reader will be convince$
<PB N="289" REF="293">
that, notwith&s;tanding the defeat at Ticonderoga, and the
di&s;a&s;ter of the advanced party in the neighbourhood of
Fort du Que&s;ne, the arms of Great-Britain acquired many
important advantages; and, indeed, paved the way for the
reduction of Quebeck, and conque&s;t of all Canada. In
the mean time, the Admirals Bo&s;cawen and Hardy, having
left a con&s;iderable &s;quadron at Halifax, in Nova-Scotia,
returned with four &s;hips of the line to England, where
they arrived in the beginning of November, after having
given cha&s;e to &s;ix large French &s;hips, which they de&s;cried
to the we&s;tward of Scilly, but could not overtake or
bring to an engagement.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The conque&s;t of the French &s;ettlements in the
river Senegal being deemed imperfect and incomplete,
whil&s;t France &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land of Goree,
the mini&s;try of Great-Britain re&s;olved to crown the cam|paign
in Africa with the reduction of that fortre&s;s. For
this purpo&s;e Commodore Keppel, brother to the Earl of
Albemarle, was ve&s;ted with the command of a &s;quadron,
con&s;i&s;ting of four &s;hips of the line, &s;everal frigates, two
bomb-ketches, and &s;ome tran&s;ports, having on board &s;even
hundred men of the regular troops, commanded by Colonel
Worge, and embarked in the harbour of Cork in Ireland,
from whence this whole armament took their departure on
the eleventh day of November. After a tempe&s;tuous
pa&s;&s;age, in which they touched at the i&s;le of Teneriffe,
they arrived at Goree in the latter end of December, and
the Commodore made a di&s;po&s;ition for attacking this
$&s;land, which was remarkably &s;trong by nature, but very
indifferently fortified. Goree is a &s;mall barren i&s;land,
extending about three quarters of a mile in length, of a
triangular form; and on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide ri&s;ing into a
$ocky hill, on which the paltry fort of St. Michael is
&s;ituated. There is another, &s;till more incon&s;iderable,
called St. Francis, towards the other extremity of the
i&s;land; and &s;everal batteries were rai&s;ed around its &s;weep,
$$ounted with about one hundred pieces of cannon, and
four mortars. The French governour, M. de St. Jean,
<PB N="290" REF="294">
had great plenty of ammunition, and his garri&s;on amounted
to about three hundred men, exclu&s;ive of as many negr$
inhabitants. The flat-bottomed boats, for di&s;embarking
the troops, being hoi&s;ted out, and di&s;po&s;ed along-&s;ide o$
the different tran&s;ports, the Commodore &s;tationed his &s;hip$
on the we&s;t-&s;ide of the i&s;land, and the engagement began
with a &s;hell from one of the ketches. This was a &s;igna$
for the great &s;hips, which poured in their broad&s;ides with|out
intermi&s;&s;ion, and the fire was returned with equal
vivacity from all the batteries of the i&s;land. In the cour&s;e
of the action the cannonading from the &s;hips became &s;o
&s;evere and terrible, that the French garri&s;on de&s;erted their
quarters, in &s;pite of all the efforts of the governour, who
acquitted him&s;elf like a man of honour; but he was obliged
to &s;trike his colours, and &s;urrender at di&s;cretion, after a
&s;hort but warm di&s;pute, in which the lo&s;s of the Briti&s;h
Commodore did not exceed one hundred men killed and
wounded. The &s;ucce&s;s of the day was the more extraor|dinary,
as the French garri&s;on had not lo&s;t a man, except
one negro killed by the bur&s;ting of a bomb-&s;hell, and the
number of their wounded was very incon&s;iderable. While
the attack la&s;ted, the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of the continent was
lined with a concour&s;e of negroes, a&s;&s;embled to view the
combat, who expre&s;&s;ed their &s;entiments and &s;urpri&s;e in
loud clamour and uncouth ge&s;ticulations, and &s;eemed to
be impre&s;&s;ed with awe and a&s;toni&s;hment at the power and
execution of the Briti&s;h &s;quadron. The French colours
being &s;truck, as a &s;ignal of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, the Commodore
&s;ent a detachment of marines on &s;hore, who di&s;armed the
garri&s;on, and hoi&s;ted the Briti&s;h flag upon the ca&s;tle of St.
Michael. In the mean time, the governour and the re&s;t
of the pri&s;oners were &s;ecured among the &s;hipping. Thus
the important i&s;land of Goree fell into the hands of the
Engli&s;h, together with two trading ve&s;&s;els that chanced
to be at anchor in the road, and &s;tores, money, and mer|chandi&s;e
to the value of twenty thou&s;and pounds. Part
of the troops being left in garri&s;on at Goree, under the
command of Major Newton, together with three &s;loops
<PB N="291" REF="295">
for his &s;ervice, the &s;quadron being watered and refre&s;hed
from the continent, that part of which is governed by one
of the Jalof kings, and the pri&s;oners, with their baggage,
being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in three cartel &s;hips to France, the Com|modore
&s;et &s;ail for Senegal, and re-enforced Fort-Louis
with the re&s;t of the troops, under Colonel Worge, who
was at this juncture favoured with a vi&s;it by the King of
Legibelli: but very little pains were taken to di&s;mi&s;s this
potentate in good humour, or maintain the di&s;po&s;ition he
profe&s;&s;ed to favour the commerce of Great-Britain. True
it is, he was de&s;irous of engaging the Engli&s;h in his quar|rels
with &s;ome neighbouring nations; and &s;uch engage|ments
were cautiou&s;ly and politically avoided, becau&s;e it
was the intere&s;t of Great-Britain to be upon good terms
with every African prince who could promote and extend
the commerce of her &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. Commodore Keppel having reduced Goree, and
re-enforced the garri&s;on of Senegal, returned to England,
where all his &s;hips arrived, after a very tempe&s;tuous voyage,
in which the &s;quadron had been di&s;per&s;ed. This expe|dition,
however &s;ucce&s;sful in the main, was attended
with one misfortune, the lo&s;s of the Lichfield &s;hip of war,
commanded by Captain Barton, which, together with one
tran&s;port and a bomb-tender, was wrecked on the coa&s;t of
Barbary, about nine leagues to the northward of Saffy, in
the dominions of Morocco. One hundred and thirty men,
including &s;everal officers, peri&s;hed on this occa&s;ion; but
the captain and the re&s;t of the company, to the number of
two hundred and twenty, made &s;hift to reach the &s;hore,
where they ran the ri&s;que of &s;tarving, and were cruelly
u&s;ed by the natives, although a treaty of peace at that
time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Great-Britain and Morocco; nay,
they were even en&s;laved by the Emperor, who detained
them in captivity until they were ran&s;omed by the Briti&s;h
government: &s;o little dependence can be placed on the faith
of &s;uch barbarian princes, with whom it is even a di&s;grace
for any civili&s;ed nation to be in alliance, whatever com|mercial
advantages may ari&s;e from the connexion.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="296">
&sect; XII. The incidents of the war that happened in the
We&s;t-Indies, during the&s;e occurrences, may be reduced
to a &s;mall compa&s;s. Nothing extraordinary was atchieved
in the neighbourhood of Jamaica, where Admiral Coates
commanded a &s;mall &s;quadron, from which he detached
crui&s;ers occa&s;ionally for the protection of the Briti&s;h com|merce;
and at Antigua the trade was effectually &s;ecured
by the vigilance of Captain Tyrrel, who&s;e courage and
activity were equal to his conduct and circum&s;pection. In
the month of March, this gentleman, with his own &s;hip
the Buckingham, and the Cambridge, another of the line,
demoli&s;hed a fort on the i&s;land of Martinique, and de&s;troyed
four privateers riding under its protection; but his valou$
appeared much more con&s;picuous in a &s;ub&s;equent engage|ment,
which happened in the month of November. Be|ing
detached on a crui&s;e in his own &s;hip, the Buckingham&punc;
by Commodore Moore, who commanded at the Leewar$
I&s;lands, he fell in with the Weazle &s;loop, commanded by
Captain Boles, between the i&s;lands of Mont&s;errat and
Guadaloupe, and immediately di&s;covered a fleet of nineteen
fail, under convoy of a French &s;hip of war carrying &s;eventy-four
cannon, and two large frigates. Captain Tyrrel im|mediately
gave cha&s;e with all the &s;ail he could carry, and
the Weazle running clo&s;e to the enemy, received a whole
broad&s;ide from the large &s;hip, which, however, &s;he &s;u&s;tained
without much damage: neverthele&s;s, Mr. Tyrrel ordered
her commander to keep aloof, as he could not be &s;uppo&s;ed
able to bear the &s;hock of large metal, and he him&s;elf prepared
for the engagement. The enemy's large &s;hip, the Flo|ri&s;&s;ant,
though of much greater force than the Bucking|ham,
in&s;tead of lying-to for his coming up, made a run|ning
fight with her &s;tern-cha&s;e, while the two frigates
annoyed him in his cour&s;e, &s;ometimes raking him fore and
aft, and &s;ometimes lying on his quarter. At length he
came along-&s;ide of the Flori&s;&s;ant, within pi&s;tol &s;hot, and
poured in a whole broad&s;ide, which did con&s;iderable
execution. The &s;alutation was returned with equal
vivacity, and a furious engagement en&s;ued. Captain
<PB N="293" REF="297">
Tyrrel was wounded in the face, and lo&s;t three fingers of
his right hand; &s;o that, being entirely di&s;abled, he was
obliged to delegate the command of the &s;hip to his fir&s;t
lieutenant, Mr. Mar&s;hal, who continued the battle with
great gallantry until he lo&s;t his life: then the charge
devolved to the &s;econd lieutenant, who acquitted him&s;elf
with equal honour, and &s;u&s;tained a de&s;perate fight again&s;t
three &s;hips of the enemy. The officers and crew of the
Buckingham exerted them&s;elves with equal vigour and
deliberation, and Captain Troy, who commanded a de|tachment
of marines on the poop, plied his &s;mall arms &s;o
effectually, as to drive the French from their quarters. At
length confu&s;ion, terrour, and uproar prevailing on board
the Flori&s;&s;ant, her firing cea&s;ed, and her colours were hauled
down about twilight; but her commander, perceiving
that the Buckingham was too much damaged in her rig|ging
to pur&s;ue with any hope of &s;ucce&s;s, ordered all his
&s;ails to be &s;et, and fled in the dark with his two con&s;orts.
Nothing but this circum&s;tance could have prevented a
Briti&s;h &s;hip of &s;ixty-five guns, indifferently manned in
re&s;pect to number, from taking a French &s;hip of the line,
mounted with &s;eventy-four pieces of cannon, provided
with &s;even hundred men, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two large frigates,
one of thirty-eight guns, and the other wanting two of
this number. The lo&s;s of the Buckingham, in this
action, did not exceed twenty men killed and wounded;
whereas, the number of the &s;lain on board the Flori&s;&s;ant
did not fall &s;hort of one hundred and eighty, and that of
her wounded is &s;aid to have exceeded three hundred. She
was &s;o di&s;abled in her hull, that &s;he could hardly be kept
a&s;loat until &s;he reached Martinique, where &s;he was re|paired;
and the large&s;t frigate, together with the lo&s;s of
forty men, received &s;uch damage as to be for &s;ome time
quite un&s;erviceable.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. In the Ea&s;t-Indies the tran&s;actions of the war
were chequered with a variety of &s;ucce&s;s; but, on the
whole, the de&s;igns of the enemy were entirely defeated.
The French commander, M. de Bu&s;&s;y, had, in the year one
<PB N="294" REF="298">
thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;ix, quarrelled with
Salabatzing, viceroy of Decan, becau&s;e this la&s;t would
not put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fortre&s;s of Golconda. In
the cour&s;e of the next year, while the Engli&s;h forces were
employed in Bengal, M. de Bu&s;&s;y made him&s;elf ma&s;ter o$
the Briti&s;h factories of Ingeram, Bandermalanka, and
Vizagapatam, and the reduction of this la&s;t l$ft the ene|my
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole coa&s;t of Coromandel, from
Ganjam to Ma&s;&s;ulapatam. While a body of the Engli&s;h
company's forces, under Captain Caillaud, endeavoured to
reduce the important fortre&s;s and town of Madura, the
French, under M. D'Anteuil, inve&s;ted Trichinopoly&punc;
Caillaud no &s;ooner received intelligence of the danger to
which this place was expo&s;ed, than he ha&s;tened to its re|lief,
and obliged the enemy to abandon the &s;iege. Then
he returned to Madura, and, after an un&s;ucce&s;sful a&s;&s;ault,
made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it by capitulation. During the&s;e
tran&s;actions, Colonel Ford made an attempt upon the
fort of Nelloure, a &s;trong place, at the di&s;tance of twenty-four
miles from Madras, but mi&s;carried; and this was
al&s;o the fate of an expedition again&s;t Wandewa&s;h, under|taken
by Colonel Aldercron. The fir&s;t was repul&s;ed in
&s;torming the place, the other was anticipated by the French
army, which marched from Pondicherry to the relief of
the garri&s;on. The French king had &s;ent a con&s;iderable
re-enforcement to the Ea&s;t-Indies, under the command of
General Lally, an officer of Iri&s;h extraction, together with
&s;uch a number of &s;hips as rendered the &s;quadron of M.
d'Apch&eacute; &s;uperior to that of Admiral Pococke, who had
&s;ucceeded Admiral Wat&s;on, lately decea&s;ed, in the com|mand
of the Engli&s;h &s;quadron &s;tationed on the coa&s;t of
Coromandel, which, in the beginning of this year, was
re-enforced from England with &s;everal &s;hips, under the
direction of Commodore Stevens. Immediately after this
junction, which was effected in the road of Madras on
the twenty-fourth day of March, Admiral Pococke, who
had already &s;ignalized him&s;elf by his courage, vigilance,
and conduct, &s;ailed to windward, with a view to intercept
<PB N="295" REF="299">
the French &s;quadron, of which he had received intelli|gence.
In two days he de&s;cried in the road of Fort St.
David the enemy's fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of nine &s;hips, which
immediately &s;tood out to &s;ea, and formed the line of battle
a-head. The Admiral took the &s;ame precaution, and
bearing down upon M. d'Apch&eacute;, the engagement began
about three in the afternoon. The French commodore,
having &s;u&s;tained a warm action for about two hours, bore
away with his whole fleet, and being joined by two &s;hips,
formed a line of battle again to leeward. Admiral Pococke's
own &s;hip, and &s;ome others, being greatly damaged in their
ma&s;ts and rigging, two of his captains having mi&s;behaved
in the action, and night coming on, he did not think it
advi&s;eable to pur&s;ue them with all the &s;ail he could carry;
but&punc; neverthele&s;s, he followed them at a proper di&s;tance,
&s;tanding to the &s;outh-we&s;t, in order to maintain the wea|ther-gage,
in ca&s;e he &s;hould be able to renew the action
in the morning. In this expectation, however, he was
di&s;appointed; the enemy &s;howed no lights, nor made any
&s;ignals that could be ob&s;erved; and in the morning not
the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of them appeared. Mr. Pococke, on the
&s;uppo&s;ition that they had weathered him in the night,
endeavoured to work up after them to windward, but
finding he lo&s;t ground con&s;iderably, he dropped anchor
about three leagues to the northward of Sadras, and re|ceived
intelligence from the chief of that &s;ettlement, that
one of the large&s;t French &s;hips having been di&s;abled in the
engagement, was run a&s;hore to the &s;outhward of Alem|parve,
where their whole &s;quadron lay at anchor. Such
was the i&s;&s;ue of the fir&s;t action between the Engli&s;h and
French &s;quadrons in the Ea&s;t-Indies, which, over and
above the lo&s;s of a capital &s;hip, is &s;aid to have co&s;t the ene|my
about five hundred men, whereas the Briti&s;h admiral
did not lo&s;e one-fifth part of that number. Being di&s;|&s;atisfied
with the behaviour of three captains, he, on his
return to Madras, appointed a court-martial to enquire
into their conduct; two were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice,
<PB N="296" REF="300">
and the third was &s;entenced to lo&s;e one year's rank as a
po&s;t-captain.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. In the mean time Mr. Lally had di&s;embarked
his troops at Pondicherry, and taking the field, imme|diately
inve&s;ted the fort of St. David, while the &s;quadro$
blocked it up by &s;ea. Two Engli&s;h &s;hips being at anchor
in the road when the enemy arrived, their captains &s;eeing
no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping, ran them on &s;hore, &s;et them or
fire, and retired with their men into the fortre&s;s, which
however, was in a few days &s;urrendered. A much more
re&s;olute defence was expected from the courage and con|duct
of Major Polier, who commanded the garri&s;on
When he arrived at Madras he was &s;ubjected to a cour$
of enquiry, which acquitted him of cowardice, but were
of opinion that the place might have held out much longer
and that the terms on which it &s;urrendered were &s;hameful
as the enemy were not even ma&s;ters of the outward covere$
way, as they had made no breach, and had a wet ditch to
fill up and pa&s;s, before the town could have been properly
a&s;&s;aulted. Polier, in order to wipe off this di&s;grace, de|&s;ired
to &s;erve as a volunteer, with Colonel Draper, and
was mortally wounded in a &s;ally at the &s;iege of Madras&punc;
Admiral Pococke having, to the be&s;t of his power, re|paired
his &s;hattered &s;hips, &s;et &s;ail again on the tenth of
May, in order to attempt the relief of Fort St. David's;
but, notwith&s;tanding his utmo&s;t endeavours, he could not
reach it in time to be of any &s;ervice. On the thirtieth day
of the month he came in &s;ight of Pondicherry, from whence
the French &s;quadron &s;tood away early next morning, nor
was it in his power to come up with them, though he
made all po&s;&s;ible efforts for that purpo&s;e. Then receiving
intelligence that Fort St. David's was &s;urrendered to the
enemy, he returned again to Madras, in order to refre&s;h
his &s;quadron. On the twenty-fifth day of July, he &s;ailed
a third time in que&s;t of M. d'Apch&eacute;, and, in two days
perceived his &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;ting of eight &s;hips of the line
and a frigate, at anchor in the road of Pondicherry. They
no &s;ooner de&s;cried him advancing than they &s;tood out to
<PB N="297" REF="301">
&s;ea as before, and he continued to cha&s;e, in hopes of
bringing them to an engagement; but all his endeavours
proved fruitle&s;s till the third day of Augu&s;t, when having
obtained the weather-gage, he bore down upon them in
order of battle. The engagement began with great impe|tuo&s;ity
on both &s;ides, but in little more than ten minutes
M. d'Apch&eacute; &s;et his fore-&s;ail, and bore away, his whole
&s;quadron following his example, and maintaining a run|ning
fight in a very irregular line. The Briti&s;h Admiral
then hoi&s;ted the &s;ignal for a general cha&s;e, which the
enemy perceiving, thought proper to cut away their boats,
and crowd with all the &s;ail they could carry. They
e&s;caped by favour of the night into the road of Pondicherry,
and Mr. Pococke anchored with his &s;quadron off Carical,
a French &s;ettlement, having thus obtained an undi&s;puted
victory, with the lo&s;s of thirty men killed, and one hundred
and &s;ixteen wounded, including Commodore Stevens and
Captain Martin, though their wounds were not dangerous.
The number of killed and wounded on board the French
&s;quadron amounted, according to report, to five hundred
and forty; and their fleet was &s;o much damaged, that in
the beginning of September their commodore &s;ailed for
the i&s;land of Bourbon, in the &s;ame latitude with Madaga&s;|car,
in order to refit; thus leaving the command and &s;o|vereignty
of the Indian &s;eas to the Engli&s;h admiral, who&s;e
fleet, from the beginning of this campaign, had been much
inferior to the French &s;quadron in number of &s;hips and
men, as well as in weight of metal.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. Mr. Lally having reduced Cuddalore and Fort
St. David's<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Cuddalore was in &s;uch a defencele&s;s condition, that it could make no re&s;i&s;tance: and there being no place in Fort St. David's bomb-proof, nor any provi&s;ions or fre&s;h water, the garri&s;on &s;urrendered in twelve days, on capit$|lation, after having &s;u&s;tained a &s;evere bombardment.</NOTE>, re&s;olved to extort a &s;um of money from the
King of Tanjour, on pretence that, in the la&s;t war, he
had granted an obligation to the French governour for a
certain &s;um, which had never been paid. Lally accord|ingly
marched with a body of three thou&s;and men into the
dominions of Tanjour, and demanded &s;eventy-two lack of
<PB N="298" REF="302">
rupees. The extravagant demand being rejected, he
plundered Nagare, a trading town on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, and
afterwards inve&s;ted the capital: but after he had pro&s;e|cuted
the &s;iege until a breach was made, his provi&s;ions and
ammunition beginning to fail, &s;everal vigorous &s;allies being
made by the forces of the King of Tanjour, and the place
well defended by European gunners, &s;ent from the Eng|li&s;h
garri&s;on at Trichinopoly, he found him&s;elf obliged to
rai&s;e the &s;iege, and retreat with precipitation, leaving his
cannon behind. He arrived at Carical about the middle
of Augu&s;t, and from thence retired to Pondicherry to|wards
the end of September. He afterwards cantoned
his troops in the province of Arcot, entered the city with|out
oppo&s;ition, and began to make preparations for the
&s;iege of Madras, which &s;hall be recorded among the inci|dents
of the &s;ucceeding year. In the mean time, the land|forces
belonging to the Ea&s;t-India company were &s;o much
out-numbered by the re-enforcements which arrived with
Mr. Lally, that they could not pretend to keep the field,
but were obliged to remain on the defen&s;ive, and provide
as well as they could for the &s;ecurity of Fort St. George,
and the other &s;ettlements in that part of India.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. Having particulari&s;ed the events of the war
which di&s;tingui&s;hed this year in America, Africa, and
A&s;ia, tho&s;e remote &s;cenes in which the intere&s;t of Great-Britain
was immediately and intimately concerned, it now
remains to record the incidents of the military operations
in Germany, &s;upported by Briti&s;h &s;ub&s;idies, and enforced
by Briti&s;h troops, to favour the a&mdash;de&s;igns of an ally,
from who&s;e &s;olitary friend&s;hip the Briti&s;h nation can never
reap any &s;olid benefit; and to defend a foreign el&mdash;,
in who&s;e behalf &s;he had already lavi&s;hed an immen&s;ity of
trea&s;ure. Notwith&s;tanding the blood&s;hed and ravages
which had &s;ignali&s;ed the former campaign, the mutual
lo&s;&s;es of the belligerent powers, the incredible expen&s;e of
money, the difficulty of recruiting armies thinned by
&s;word and di&s;temper, the &s;carcity of forage and provi&s;ion,
the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Saxony in particular, and the calamities of
<PB N="299" REF="303">
war, which de&s;olated the greate&s;t part of the empire, no
propo&s;ition of peace was hinted by either of the parties
concerned, but the powers at variance &s;eemed to be ex|a&s;perated
again&s;t each other with the mo&s;t implacable
re&s;entment. Jarring intere&s;ts were harmoni&s;ed, old pre|judices
rooted up, inveterate jealou&s;ies a&s;&s;uaged, and even
incon&s;i&s;tencies reconciled, in connecting the confederacy
which was now formed and e&s;tabli&s;hed again&s;t the King
of Pru&s;&s;ia; and, on the other hand, the King of Great-Britain
&s;eemed determined to employ the whole power and
influence of his crown in &s;upporting this monarch. Yet
the members of the grand confederacy were differently
actuated by di&s;agreeing motives, which, in the &s;equel,
operated for the pre&s;ervation of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, by
preventing the full exertion of their united &s;trength. The
Empre&s;s-Queen, over and above her de&s;ire of retrieving
Sile&s;ia, which was her primary aim, gave way to the &s;ug|ge&s;tions
of per&s;onal hatred and revenge, to the gratifica|tion
of which &s;he may be &s;aid to have &s;acrificed, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, the intere&s;ts of her family, as well as the repo&s;e
of the empire, by admitting the natural enemies of her
hou&s;e into the Au&s;trian Netherlands, and inviting them
to invade the dominions of her co-e&s;tates with a formidable
army. France, true to her old political maxims, wi&s;hed
to &s;ee the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria weakened by the divi&s;ions in
the empire, which &s;he accordingly formented: for this
rea&s;on it could not be her intere&s;t to effect the ruin of the
hou&s;e of Brandenburgh; and, therefore, &s;he had, no
doubt, &s;et bounds to the pro&s;ecution of her &s;chemes in con|cert
with the court of Vienna; but her de&s;igns again&s;t
Hanover amounted to ab&s;olute conque&s;t: in pur&s;uance
of the&s;e, &s;he &s;ent an army of one hundred and twenty
thou&s;and men acro&s;s the Rhine, in&s;tead of four-and-twenty
thou&s;and, which &s;he had engaged to furni&s;h by the original
treaty with the Empre&s;s-Queen of Hungary, who is &s;aid
to have &s;hared in the &s;poils of the electorate. The Cza|rina,
by co-operating with the hou&s;es of Bourbon and
Au&s;tria, gratified her per&s;onal di&s;gu&s;t towards the Pru&s;&s;ian
<PB N="300" REF="304">
monarch, augmented her finances by con&s;iderable &s;ub|&s;idies
from both, and perhaps amu&s;ed her&s;elf with the
hope of obtaining an e&s;tabli&s;hment in the German empire;
but whether &s;he wavered in her own &s;entiments, or her
mini&s;try fluctuated between the promi&s;es of France and the
pre&s;ents of Great-Britain, certain it is, her forces had not
acted with vigour in Pomerania; and her General Apraxin,
in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting his advantage, had retreated imme|diately
after the Pru&s;&s;ians mi&s;carried in their attack. He
was indeed di&s;graced, and tried for having thus retired with|out
orders: but in all probability this trial was no other than
a farce, acted to amu&s;e the other confederates, while the
Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia gained time to deliberate upon the offers
that were made, and determine with regard to the advan|tages
or di&s;advantages that might accrue to her from per|&s;evering
in the engagements which &s;he had contracted. As
for the Swedes, although they had been in&s;tigated to
ho&s;tilities again&s;t Pru&s;&s;ia by the intrigues of France, and
flattered with hopes of retrieving Pomerania, they pro&s;e|cuted
the war in &s;uch a di&s;pirited and ineffectual manner,
as plainly proved that either the ancient valour of that
people was extinct, or that the nation was not heartily en|gaged
in the quarrel.</P>
<P>XVII. When the Ru&s;&s;ian general Apraxin retreated
from Pomerania, Mare&s;chal Lehwald, who commanded
the Pru&s;&s;ians in that country, was left at liberty to turn
his arms again&s;t the Swedes, and accordingly drove them
before him almo&s;t without oppo&s;ition. By the beginning
of January they had evacuated all Pru&s;&s;ian Pomerania,
and Lehwald invaded their dominions in his turn. He, in
a little time, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all Swedi&s;h Pome|rania,
except Stral&s;und and the i&s;le of Rugen, and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed
him&s;elf of &s;everal magazines which the enemy had
erected. The Au&s;trian army, after their defeat at Bre&s;lau,
had retired into Bohemia, where they were cantoned,
the head-quarters being fixed at Koning&s;gratz. The
King of Pru&s;&s;ia having cleared all his part of Sile&s;ia,
except the town of Schweidnitz, which he circum&s;cribed
<PB N="301" REF="305">
with a blockade, &s;ent detachments from his army cantoned
in the neighbourhood of Bre&s;lau, to penetrate into the
Au&s;trian or &s;outhern part of Sile&s;ia, where they &s;urpri&s;ed
Troppau and Jaggern&s;dorf, while he him&s;elf remained at
Bre&s;lau, entertaining his officers with concerts of mu&s;ick.
Not that he &s;uffered the&s;e amu&s;ements to divert his at|tention
from &s;ubjects of greater importance. He laid
Swedi&s;h Pomerania under contribution, and made a fre&s;h
demand of five hundred thou&s;and crowns from the electo|rate
of Saxony. Having received intimation that the
Duke of Mecklenbourg was employed in providing maga|zines
for the French army, he detached a body of troops
into that country, who not only &s;ecured the magazines,
but levied con&s;iderable contributions; and the Duke re|tired
to Lubeck, attended by the French mini&s;ter. The
&s;tates of Saxony having proved a little dilatory in obeying
his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's injunction, received a &s;econd inti|mation,
importing, that they &s;hould levy and deliver,
within a certain time, eighteen thou&s;and recruits for his
army, pay into the hands of his commi&s;&s;ary one year's
revenue of the electorate in advance; and Leipzick was
taxed with an extraordinary &s;ub&s;idy of eight hundred thou|&s;and
crowns, on pain of military execution. The States
were immediately convoked at Leipzick, in order to deli|berate
on the&s;e demands; and the city being unable to pay
&s;uch a con&s;iderable &s;um, the Pru&s;&s;ian troops began to put
their monarch's threats in execution. He ju&s;tified the&s;e
proceedings, by declaring that the enemy had practi&s;ed
the &s;ame violence and oppre&s;&s;ion on the territories of his
allies; but how the practice of his declared enemies, in
countries which they had invaded and &s;ubdued in the com|mon
cour&s;e of war, &s;hould ju&s;tify him in pillaging and
oppre&s;&s;ing a people, with whom neither he nor his allies
were at war, it is not ea&s;y to conceive. As little can we
reconcile this conduct to the character of a prince, a&s;&s;u|ming
the title of Protector of the Prote&s;tant Religion,
which is the e&s;tabli&s;hed faith among tho&s;e very Saxons
who were &s;ubjected to &s;uch grievous impo&s;itions; impo&s;i|tions
<PB N="302" REF="306">
the more grievous and unmerited, as they had never
taken any &s;hare in the pre&s;ent war, but cautiou&s;ly avoided
every &s;tep that might be con&s;trued into provocation, &s;ince
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia declared they might depend upon his
protection.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. Before we proceed to enumerate the events
of the campaign, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to inform the reader,
that the forces brought into the field by the Empre&s;s-Queen
of Hungary, and the States of the Empire, the Czarina,
the Kings of France and Sweden, fell very little &s;hort of
three hundred thou&s;and men; and all the&s;e were de&s;tined
to act again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia and the Elector of Hano|ver.
In oppo&s;ition to this formidable confederacy, his
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was, by the &s;ub&s;idy from England, the
&s;poils of Saxony, and the revenues of Brandenbourg,
enabled to maintain an army of one hundred and forty thou|&s;and
men; while the Elector of Hanover a&s;&s;embled a body of
&s;ixty thou&s;and men, compo&s;ed of his own electoral troops,
with the auxiliary mercenaries of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, Bucke|bourg,
Saxegotha, and Brun&s;wick Wolfenbuttel, all of
them maintained by the pay of Great-Britain. At this
juncture, indeed, there was no other fund for their &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence,
as the countries of Hanover and He&s;&s;e were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
by the enemy, and in the former the government
was entirely changed.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. In the month of December in the preceding
year, a farmer of the revenues from Paris arrived at Hano|ver,
where he e&s;tabli&s;hed his office, in order to act by
virtue of powers from one John Faidy, to whom the French
King granted the direction, receipt, and admini&s;tration of
all the duties and revenues of the electorate. This di|rector
was, by a decree of the council of &s;tate, empower|ed
to receive the revenues, not only of Hanover, but al&s;o
of all other countries that &s;hould be &s;ubjected to his Mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty in the cour&s;e of the campaign; to re|move
the receivers who had been employed in any part of
the direction, receipt, and admini&s;tration of the duties and
revenues of Hanover, and appoint others in their room.
<PB N="303" REF="307">
The French King, by the &s;ame decree, ordained, that
all per&s;ons who had been entru&s;ted under the preceding
government with titles, papers, accounts, regi&s;ters, or
e&s;timates, relating to the admini&s;tration of the revenues
&s;hould communicate them to John Faidy, or his attor|nies;
that the magi&s;trates of the town, di&s;tricts, and com|monalties,
as well as tho&s;e who directed the admini&s;tration
of particular &s;tates and provinces, &s;hould deliver to the
&s;aid John Faidy, or his attornies, the produce of &s;ix years
of the duties and revenues belonging to the &s;aid towns,
di&s;tricts, and provinces, reckoning from the fir&s;t of Janu|ary
in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty one,
together with an authentick account of the &s;ums they had
paid during that term to the preceding &s;overeign, and of
the charges nece&s;&s;arily incurred. It appears from the na|ture
of this decree, which was dated on the eighteenth day
of October that immediately after the conventions of
Clo&s;ter-Sev$$$ and Bremeworden<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Six days after the convention was &s;igned at Clo&s;ter-Seven, another act of accommodation was concluded at Bremeworden, between the Generals $porcken and Villemur, relating to the relea&s;e of pri&s;oners, and &s;ome other $oints omitted in the convention.</NOTE>, the court of Ver&s;ailles
had deter$$ $word$ to change the government and &s;y&s;tem of
the electo$$$ $word$ to an expre&s;s article of the capi|tulation
$word$ to the city of Hanover, when it &s;urrender|ed
on the $inth day of Augu&s;t; and that the crown of
France intended to take advantage of the ce&s;&s;ation of arms,
in &s;ei&s;ing places and provinces which were not yet &s;ubdued;
for, by the decree above mentioned, the admini&s;tration of
John Faidy extended to the countries which might here|after
be conquered. With what regard to ju&s;tice, then,
could the French government charge the Elector of Hano|ver
with the infraction of articles? or what re&s;pect to good
faith and humanity did the Duke de Richelieu ob&s;erve, in
the order i&s;&s;ued from Zell, towards the end of the year,
importing, that as the treaty made with the country of
Hanover had been rendered void by the violation of the
articles &s;igned at Clo&s;ter-Seven, all the effects belonging to
the officers, or others, employed in the Hanoverian army
<PB N="304" REF="308">
&s;hould be confi&s;cated for the u&s;e of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
Maje&s;ty?</P>
<P>&sect; XX. The Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, being de&s;irous
of averting a like &s;torm from his dominions, not only pro|mi&s;ed
to renounce all connexion with the Kings of Great-Britain
and Pru&s;&s;ia, but even &s;ollicited the court of France
to receive him among the number of its dependants; for,
on the eighteenth day of October, the mini&s;ter of the Due
de Deuxponts delivered at Ver&s;ailles, in the name of the
Landgrave, the plan of a treaty founded on the following
conditions. The Landgrave, after having expre&s;&s;ed an
ardent defire of attaching him&s;elf wholly to France, pro|po&s;ed
the&s;e articles: That he &s;hould enter into no engage|ment
again&s;t the King and his allies; and give no a&s;&s;i&s;tance
directly or indirectly to the enemies of his Maje&s;ty and
his allies: that he &s;hould never give his vote, in the gene|ral
or particular a&s;&s;emblies of the Empire, again&s;t his Ma|je&s;ty's
intere&s;t; but, on the contrary, employ his intere&s;t,
jointly with France, to quiet the troubles of the Empire:
that, for this end, his troops, which had &s;erved in the
Hanoverian army, &s;hould engage in the &s;ervice of France,
on condition that they &s;hould not act in the pre&s;ent war
again&s;t his Britannick Maje&s;ty: that, immediately after
the ratification of the treaty, his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty
&s;hould re&s;tore the dominions of the Landgrave in the &s;ame
condition they were in when &s;ubdued by the French forces:
that the&s;e dominions &s;hould be exempted from all further
contributions, either in money, corn, forage, wood, or
cattle, though already impo&s;ed on the &s;ubjects of He&s;&s;e;
and the French troops pay for all the provi&s;ion with which
they might be &s;upplied; in which ca&s;e the Landgrave
&s;hould exact no toll for warlike &s;tores, provi&s;ions, or other
articles of that nature, which might pa&s;s through his do|minions:
that the King of France &s;hould guarantee all
his e&s;tates, all the rights of the hou&s;e of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, par|ticularly
the act of a&s;&s;urance &s;igned by his &s;on, the here|ditary
prince, with regard to religion; u&s;e his intere&s;t with
the Emperor and the Empre&s;s-Queen, that, in con&s;ider|ation
<PB N="305" REF="309">
of the immen&s;e lo&s;&s;es and damages his mo&s;t &s;erene
highne&s;s had &s;uffered &s;ince the French invaded his coun|try,
and of the great &s;ums he &s;hould lo&s;e with England
in arrears and &s;ub&s;idies by this accommodation, he might
be excu&s;ed from furni&s;hing his contingent to the army of
the Empire, as well as from paying the Roman months
granted by the diet of the Empire; and if, in re&s;entment
of this convention, the &s;tates of his &s;erene highne&s;s &s;hould
be attacked, his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty &s;hould afford the
mo&s;t &s;peedy and effectual &s;uccours. The&s;e propo&s;als
will &s;peak for them&s;elves to the reader's apprehen&s;ion;
and if he is not blinded by the darke&s;t mi&s;ts of prejudice,
exhibit a clear and di&s;tinct idea of a genuine German
ally. The Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el had been fed with
the good things of England, even in time of peace, when
his friend&s;hip could not avail, nor his aver&s;ion prejudice
the intere&s;ts of Great-Britain: but he was retained in that
&s;ea&s;on of tranquillity as a friend, on who&s;e &s;ervices the
mo&s;t implicit dependence might be placed in any future
&s;torm or commotion. How far he merited this confidence
and favour might have been determined by reflecting on
his conduct during the former war: in the cour&s;e of which
his troops were hired to the King of Great-Britain and
his enemies alternately, as the &s;cale of convenience happen|ed
to preponderate. Since the commencement of the pre|&s;ent
troubles, he had acted as a mercenary to Great-Bri|tain,
although he was a principal in the di&s;pute, and &s;tood
connected with her de&s;igns by &s;olemn treaty, as well as by
all the ties of gratitude and honour: but now that the cau&s;e
of Hanover &s;eemed to be on the decline, and his own
dominions had &s;uffered by the fate of the war, he not only
appeared willing to abandon his benefactor and ally, but
even &s;ued to be inli&s;ted in the &s;ervice of his adver&s;ary.
This intended defection was, however, prevented by a
&s;udden turn of fortune, which he could not po&s;&s;ibly fore|&s;ee;
and his troops continued to act in conjunction with
the Hanoverians.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="310">
&sect; XXI. The Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el was not &s;ingular
in making &s;uch advances to the French monarch. The
Duke of Brun&s;wick, &s;till more nearly connected with the
King of Great-Britain, u&s;ed &s;uch uncommon expedition
in detaching him&s;elf from the tottering fortune of Hanover,
that in ten days after the convention of Clo&s;ter-Seven
he had concluded a treaty with the courts of Vienna and
Ver&s;ailles; &s;o that the negociation mu&s;t have been begun
before that convention took place. On the twentieth day
of September his mini&s;ter at Vienna, by virtue of full
powers from the Duke of Brun&s;wick, accepted and &s;igned
the conditions which the French King and his Au&s;trian
ally thought proper to impo&s;e. The&s;e imported, That
his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty &s;hould keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
cities of Brun&s;wick and Wolfenbuttel during the war,
and make u&s;e of the artillery, arms, and military &s;tores
depo&s;ited in their ar&s;enals: that the Duke's forces, on
their return from the camp of the Duke of Cumberland,
&s;hould be di&s;banded and di&s;armed; and take an oath,
that they &s;hould not, during the pre&s;ent war, &s;erve again&s;t
the King or his allies: that the Duke &s;hould be permitted
to maintain a battalion of foot, and two &s;quadrons of hor&s;e,
for the guard of his per&s;on and ca&s;tles; but the regulations
made by Mare&s;chal Richelicu and the intendant of his
army &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t on their pre&s;ent footing: that the
Duke &s;hould furni&s;h his contingent in money and troops,
agreeably to the laws of the Empire: that his forces &s;hould
immediately join tho&s;e which the Germanick body had
a&s;&s;embled: and that he &s;hould order his mini&s;ter at Rati&s;|bon
to vote conformably to the re&s;olutions of the diet,
approved and confirmed by the Emperor. In con&s;ider|ation
of all the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, the Duke was re&s;tored to the
&s;avour of the French King, who graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed that
neither his revenues nor his trea&s;ure &s;hould be touched,
nor the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice invaded; and that nothing
further &s;hould be demanded, but winter-quarters for the
regiments which &s;hould pa&s;s that &s;ea&s;on in the country of
Brun&s;wick. How &s;crupulou&s;ly &s;oever the Duke might
<PB N="307" REF="311">
have intended to ob&s;erve the articles of this treaty, his
intentions were fru&s;trated by the conduct of his brother
Prince Ferdinand, who, being inve&s;ted with the command
of the Hanoverian army, and ordered to re&s;ume the opera|tions
of war again&s;t the enemy, detained the troops of Brun&s;|wick,
as well as his nephew the Hereditary Prince, not|with&s;tanding
the treaty which his brother had &s;igned, and
the injunctions which he had laid upon his &s;on to quit the
army, and make a tour to Holland. The Duke wrote an
expo&s;tulatory letter to Prince Ferdinand, pathetically com|plaining
that he had &s;educed his troops, decoyed his &s;on,
and di&s;graced his family; in&s;i&s;ting upon the prince's
pur&s;uing his journey as well as upon the returning the
troops: and threatening, in ca&s;e of non-compliance, to u&s;e
other means that &s;hould be more effectual<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>
<OPENER>Tran&s;lation of the letter written by the Duke of Brun&s;wick to his bro|ther Prince Ferdinand:
<SALUTE>&startq;SIR:&endq;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;I KNOW you too well to doubt that the &s;ituation in which we &s;tand at pre&s;ent, with re&s;pect to each other, gives you abundance of unea&s;ine&s;s; nor will you doubt that it gives me equal concern: indeed, it afflicts me greatly. Mean while I could never, my deare&s;t brother, have believed that you would be the per&s;on who &s;hould carry away from me my elde&s;t &s;on. I am exceed|ingly mortified to find my&s;elf under the hard nece&s;&s;ity of telling you that this &s;tep is contrary to the law of nations, and the con&s;titutions of the Empire; and that, if you per&s;i&s;t in it, you will di&s;grace your family, and bring a &s;tain upon your country, which you pretend to &s;erve. The Hereditary Prince, my &s;on, was at Hamburgh by my order, and you have carried him to Stade. Could he di&s;tru&s;t his uncle, an uncle who hath done &s;o much honour to his family? Could he believe that this uncle would deprive him of liberty, a liberty never refu&s;ed to the lowe&s;t officer: I ordered him to make a tour to Holland: could not the lowe&s;t officer have done as much? Let us &s;uppo&s;e for a moment, that my troops, among whom he &s;erved, were to have &s;taid with the Hanoverians, would it not have been &s;till in my power to give an officer leave of ab&s;ence, or even leave to re&s;ign his commi&s;&s;ion? and would you hinder your brother, the head of your family, and of &s;uch a family as ours, to exerci&s;e this right with regard to a &s;on, who is the Hereditary Prince, of who&s;e rights and prerogatives you cannot be ignorant? It is im|po&s;&s;ible you could have conceived &s;uch de&s;igns without the &s;ugge&s;tion of others. Tho&s;e who did &s;ugge&s;t them have trampled on the rights of nature, of nations, and of the princes of Germany: they have induced you to add to all the&s;e the mo&s;t cruel in&s;ult on a brother whom you love, and who always loved you with the warme&s;t affection. Would you have your bro|ther lay his ju&s;t complaints again&s;t you before the whole Empire, and all Europe? Are not your proccedings without example? What is Germany become? What are its princes become, and our hou&s;e in particular? Is it the intere&s;t of the two kings, the cau&s;e of your country, and my cau&s;e, that you pretend to &s;upport?&mdash;I repeat it, brother, that this de&s;ign could never have been framed by you. I again command my &s;on to pur&s;ue his journey; and I cannot conceive you will give the lea&s;t ob&s;truction: if you &s;hould (which I pray God avert) I &s;olemnly declare that I will not be con&s;trained by &s;uch mea&s;ures, nor &s;hall I ever forget what I owe to my&s;elf. As to my troops, you may &s;ee what I have written on that head to the Hanoverian mini&s;try. The Duke of Cumberland, by the convention of Clo&s;ter-Seven, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, and &s;ent them home: the &s;aid mini&s;try gave me notice of this convention, as a treaty by which I was bound. The march of the troops was &s;ettled; and an incident happening, they halted: that ob&s;tacle being removed, they were to have continued their march. The court of Hanover will be no longer bound by the convention, while I not only accepted it on their word, but have al&s;o, in conformity with their in&s;truc|tions, negociated at Ver&s;ailles, and at Vienna. After all the&s;e &s;teps they would have me contradict my&s;elf, break my word, and entirely ruin my e&s;tate, as well as my honour. Did you ever know you brother guilty of &s;uch things? True it is, I have, as you &s;ay, &s;acrificed my all; or rather, I have been &s;acrificed. The only thing left me is my honour; and in the unhappy contra&s;t of our &s;ituations, I lament both you and my&s;elf, that it &s;hould be from you, my dear brother, I &s;hould receive the cruel advice to give up my honour. I cannot li&s;ten to it; I cannot recede from my promi&s;e My troops, therefore, mu&s;t return home, agreeably to what the Duke of Cum|berland and the Hanoverian mini&s;try &s;tipulated with regard to me in the &s;tronge&s;t manner. I am afraid that the true circum&s;tances of things are concealed from you. Not to detain your expre&s;s too long, I &s;hall &s;end you, by the po&s;t, copies of all I have written to the Hanoverian mini&s;try. It will grieve your hone&s;t heart to read it.

Pru&s;&s;ia. The French court likewi&s;e publi&s;hed a virulent
memorial, after the convention of Clo&s;ter-Seven had been
violated, and &s;et a&s;ide, drawing an invidious parallel
between the conduct of the French King and the proceed|ings
of his Britannick Maje&s;ty; in which the latter is
taxed with breach of faith, and almo&s;t every meanne&s;s
that could &s;tain the character of a monarch. In an&s;wer
to the Emperor's decree, and this virulent charge, Baron
Gimmengen, the electoral Mini&s;ter of Brun&s;wick Lunen|bourg,
pre&s;ented to the diet, in November, a long me|morial,
recapitulating the important &s;ervices his &s;overeign
had done the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and the ungrateful returns
he had reaped, in the Queen's refu&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, when
his dominions were threatened with an inva&s;ion. He
enumerated many in&s;tances in which &s;he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted,
encouraged, and even joined the enemies of the elec|torate,
in contempt of her former engagements, and di|rectly
contrary to the con&s;titution of the Empire. He
refuted every article of the charge which the French court
had brought again&s;t him in the virulent libel, retorted
the imputations of perfidy and ambition, and with re&s;pect
to France, ju&s;tified every particular of his own con|duct.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. While the French and Hanoverian armies
remained in their winter-quarters, the former at Zell,
and the latter at Lunenbourg, divers petty enterpri&s;es
were executed by detachments with various &s;ucce&s;s. The
Hanoverian general Juncheim, having taken po&s;t at Hai|ber&s;tadt
and Quedlimburg, from whence he made ex|cur&s;ions
even to the gates of Brun&s;wick, and kept the
<PB N="310" REF="314">
French army in continual alarm, was vi&s;ited by a large
body of the enemy, who compelled him to retire to Acher|&s;leben,
committed great exce&s;&s;es in the town of Halber|&s;tadt
and its neighbourhood, and carried off ho&s;tages for
the payment of contributions. General Hardenberg,
another Hanoverian officer, having di&s;lodged the French
detachments that occupied Burgh, Vogel&s;ack, and Ritter|hude,
and cleared the whole territory of Bremen, in
the month of January the Duke de Broglio a&s;&s;embled a
con&s;iderable corps of troops that were cantoned at Otter&s;|burgh,
Rothenburg, and the adjacent country, and ad|vancing
to Bremen, demanded admittance, threatening,
that, in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al, he would have recour&s;e to ex|tremities,
and puni&s;h the inhabitants &s;everely, &s;hould they
make the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition. When their deputies waited
upon him, to de&s;ire a &s;hort time for deliberation, he an|&s;wered,
&startq;Not a moment&mdash;the Duke de Richelieu's orders
are peremptory, and admit of no delay.&endq; He accord|ingly
ordered the cannon to advance; the wall was &s;caled,
and the gates would have been forced open, had not the
magi&s;trates, at the earne&s;t importunity of the people, re|&s;olved
to comply with his demand. A &s;econd deputation
was immediately di&s;patched to the Duke de Broglio,
&s;ignifying their compliance; and the gates being opened,
he marched into the city at midnight, after having pro|mi&s;ed
upon his honour, that no attempt &s;hould be made to
the prejudice of its rights and prerogatives, and no outrage
offered to the privileges of the regency, to the liberty,
religion, and commerce of the inhabitants. This con|que&s;t,
however, was of &s;hort duration. Prince Ferdi|nand
of Brun&s;wick being joined by a body of Pru&s;&s;ian
hor&s;e, under the command of Prince George of Hol&s;tein
Gottorp, the whole army was put in motion, and advanced
to the country of Bremen about the middle of February.
The enemy were di&s;lodged from Rothenburg, Otter&s;burg,
and Verden, and they abandoned the city of Bremen at
the approach of the Hanoverian general, who took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of it without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="315">
&sect; XXIV. By this time the court of Ver&s;ailles, being
di&s;&s;atisfied with the conduct of the Duke de Richelieu,
had recalled that general from Germany, where his place
was &s;upplied by the Count de Clermont, to the general
&s;atisfaction of the army, as well as to the joy of the Hano|verian
&s;ubjects, among whom Richelieu had committed
many flagrant and inhuman acts of rapine and oppre&s;&s;ion.
The new commander found his ma&s;ter's forces reduced to
a deplorable condition, by the accidents of war, and di&s;|temper
ari&s;ing from hard duty, &s;evere weather, and the
want of nece&s;&s;aries. As he could not pretend, with &s;uch
a wretched remnant, to oppo&s;e the de&s;igns of Prince Fer|dinand
in the field, or even maintain the footing which his
predece&s;&s;or had gained, he found him&s;elf under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of retiring with all po&s;&s;ible expedition towards the
Rhine. As the allies advanced, his troops retreated from
their di&s;tant quarters with &s;uch precipitation, as to leave
behind all their &s;ick, together with a great part of their
baggage and artillery, be&s;ides a great number of officers
and &s;oldiers, that fell into the hands of tho&s;e parties by
whom they were pur&s;ued. The inhabitants of Hanover,
perceiving the French intended to abandon that city, were
overwhelmed with the fear of being &s;ubject to every &s;pe|cies
of violence and abu&s;e: but their apprehen&s;ions were
happily di&s;appointed by the honour and integrity of the
Duke de Randan, the French governor, who not only took
effectual mea&s;ures for re&s;training the &s;oldiers within the
bounds of the mo&s;t rigid di&s;cipline and moderation, but
likewi&s;e exhibited a noble proof of genero&s;ity, almo&s;t with|out
example. In&s;tead of de&s;troying his magazine of pro|vi&s;ions,
according to the u&s;ual practice of war, he ordered
the whole to be either &s;old at a low price, or di&s;tributed
among the poor of the city, who had been long expo&s;ed
to the horrours of famine: an act of godlike humanity,
which ought to dignify the character of that worthy noble|man
above all the titles that military fame can de&s;erve,
or arbitrary monarchs be&s;tow. The regency of Hanover
were &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of his heroick be|haviour
<PB N="312" REF="316">
on this occa&s;ion, that they gratefully acknowledged
it, in a letter of thanks to him and the Count de Cler|mont;
and on the day of &s;olemn thank&s;giving to heaven,
for their being delivered from their enemies, the clergy in
their &s;ermons did not fail to celebrate and extol the charity
and benevolence of the Duke de Randan. Such glorious
te&s;timonies, even from enemies, mu&s;t have afforded the
mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure to a mind endued with &s;en&s;ibility;
and this, no doubt, may be termed one of the faire&s;t tri|umphs
of humanity.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. The two grand divi&s;ions of the French army,
quartered at Zell and Hanover, retired in good order to
Hamelen, where they collected all their troops, except
tho&s;e that were left in Hoya, and about four thou&s;and men
placed in garri&s;on at Minden, to retard the operations of
the combined army. Towards the latter end of February,
Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick, having received intelli|gence
that the Count de Chabot was po&s;ted with a con|&s;iderable
body of troops at Hoya, upon the We&s;er, de|tached
the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick, with four bat|talions,
and &s;ome light troops and dragoons, to di&s;lodge
them from that neighbourhood. This enterpri&s;e was ex|ecuted
with the utmo&s;t intrepidity. The Hereditary Prince
pa&s;&s;ed the We&s;er at Bremen with part of his detachment,
while the re&s;t advanced on this &s;ide of the river; and the
enemy, being attacked in front and rear, were in a little
time forced, and thrown into confu&s;ion. The bridge
being abandoned, and near &s;even hundred men taken pri|&s;oners,
the Count de Chabot threw him&s;elf, with two bat|talions,
into the ca&s;tle, where he re&s;olved to &s;upport him|&s;elf,
in hope of being relieved. The regiment of Bretagne,
and &s;ome detachments of dragoons, were actually on the
march to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Hereditary Prince being
made acquainted with this circum&s;tance, being al&s;o de&s;ti|tute
of heavy artillery to be&s;iege the place in form, and
taking it for granted he &s;hould not be able to maintain the
po&s;t after it might be taken, he li&s;tened to the terms of
capitulation propo&s;ed by the French general, who&s;e garri|&s;on
<PB N="313" REF="317">
was &s;uffered to march out with the honours of war;
but their cannon, &s;tores, and ammunition were &s;urrender|ed
to the victor. This was the fir&s;t exploit of the Here|ditary
Prince, who&s;e valour and activity, on many &s;ub&s;e|quent
occa&s;ions, &s;hone with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre. He had
no &s;ooner reduced Hoya, than he marched to the attack of
Minden, which he inve&s;ted on the fifth day of March, and
on the fourteenth the garri&s;on &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion.
After the reduction of this city, the combined army ad|vanced
towards Hamelen, where the French general had
e&s;tabli&s;hed his head quarters: but he abandoned them at
the approach of the allies, and leaving behind all his &s;ick
and wounded, with part of his magazines, retired without
halting to Paderborn, and from thence to the Rhine, re|calling
in his march the troops that were in Embden,
Ca&s;&s;el, and the landgraviate of He&s;&s;e, all which places
were now evacuated. They were terribly harra&s;&s;ed in
their retreat by the Pru&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars, and a body of light
hor&s;e, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Hanoverian hunters,
who took a great number of pri&s;oners, together with many
baggage-waggons, and &s;ome artillery. Such was the
precipitation of the enemy's retreat, that they could not
find time to de&s;troy all their magazines of provi&s;ion and
forage; and even forgot to call in the garri&s;on of Vechte,
a &s;mall fortre&s;s in the neighbourhood of Diepholt, who
were made pri&s;oners of war, and here was found a com|plete
train of battering cannon and mortars. The Count
de Clermont, having reached the banks of the Rhine,
di&s;tributed his forces into quarters of cantonment in We&s;el
and the adjoining country, while Prince Ferdinand can|toned
the allied army in the bi&s;hoprick of Mun&s;ter: here,
however, he did not long remain inactive. In the latter
end of May he ordered a detachment to pa&s;s the Rhine at
Duy&s;burg, under the command of Colonel Scheither,
who executed his order without lo&s;s, defeated three bat|talions
of the enemy, and took five pieces of cannon. In
the beginning of June the whole army pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine,
on a bridge con&s;tructed for the occa&s;ion, defeated a body
<PB N="314" REF="318">
of French cavalry, and obtained divers other advantages
in their march towards We&s;el. Kai&s;er&s;worth was &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
the greater part of the garri&s;on either killed or
taken; and Prince Ferdinand began to make preparations
for the &s;iege of Du&s;&s;eldorp. In the mean time, the Count
de Clermont, being unable to &s;top the rapidity of his pro|gre&s;s,
was obliged to &s;ecure his troops with &s;trong en|trenchments,
until he &s;hould be properly re-enforced.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. The court of Ver&s;ailles, though equally mor|tified
and confounded at the turn of their affairs in Ger|many,
did not &s;it tamely and behold this rever&s;e; but
exerted their u&s;ual &s;pirit and expedition in retrieving the
lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained. They a&s;&s;embled a body of troops
at Hanau, under the direction of the Prince de Soubi&s;e,
who, it was &s;aid, had received orders to penetrate, by the
way of Donawert, Ingold&s;tadt, and Arnberg, into Bohe|mia.
In the mean time, re-enforcements daily arrived in
the camp of the Count de Clermont; and as repeated com|plaints
had been made of the want of di&s;cipline and &s;ubor|dination
in that army, mea&s;ures were taken for reforming
the troops by &s;everity and example. The Mare&s;chal
Duke de Bellei&s;le, who now acted as &s;ecretary at war with
uncommon ability, wrote a letter, directed to all the
colonels of infantry, threatening them, in the King's name,
with the lo&s;s of their regiments, &s;hould they connive any
longer at the &s;candalous practice of buying commi&s;&s;ions:
an abu&s;e which had crept into the &s;ervice under various
pretexts, to the di&s;couragement of merit, the relaxation of
di&s;cipline, and the total extinction of laudable emulation.
The Prince of Clermont having quitted his &s;trong camp
at Rhinefeldt, retired to Nuys, a little higher up the river,
and detached a con&s;iderable corps, under the command of
the Count de St. Germain, to take po&s;t at Crevelt, &s;ituated
in a plain between his army and the camp of the allies,
which fronted the town of Meurs: after &s;everal motions
on both &s;ides, Prince Ferdinand re&s;olved to attack the ene|my,
and forthwith made a di&s;po&s;ition for this purpo&s;e.
He a&s;&s;igned the command of the whole left wing, con|&s;i&s;ting
<PB N="315" REF="319">
of eighteen battalions and twenty-eight &s;quadrons, to Lieutenant-General Sporcken: the conduct of the right
wing, compo&s;ed of &s;ixteen battalions and fourteen &s;qua|drons,
was entru&s;ted to the Hereditary Prince and Major-General
Wangenheim; the &s;quadrons, with the addition
of two regiments of Pru&s;&s;ian dragoons, were under the im|mediate
direction of the Prince of Hal&s;tein, while the Here|ditary
Prince commanded the infantry. The light troops,
con&s;i&s;ting of five &s;quadrons of hu&s;&s;ars, were divided be|tween
the Prince of Hol&s;tein and Lieutenant General
Sporcken. Major Luckner's &s;quadron, together with
Scheither's corps, were ordered to ob&s;erve the flank of the
enemy's right, and with this view were po&s;ted in the vil|lage
of Papendeick; and a battalion of the troops of
Wolfenbuttel were left in the town of Hul&s;te, to cover
the rear of the army. Prince Ferdinand's de&s;ign was to
attack the enemy on their left flank; but the execution
was rendered extremely difficult by the woods and ditches
that embarra&s;&s;ed the route, and the numerous ditches that
inter&s;ected this part of the country. On the twenty-third
day of June, at four in the morning, the army began to
move; the right advancing in two columns as far as St.
Anthony, and the left marching up within half a league
of Crevelt. The Prince having viewed the po&s;ition of the
enemy from the &s;teeple of St. Anthony, procured guides,
and having received all the nece&s;&s;ary hints of information,
proceeded to the right, in order to charge the enemy's
left flank by the villages of Wor&s;t and Anrath; but, in
order to divide their attention, and keep them in &s;u&s;pen&s;e
with re&s;pect to the nature of his principal attack, he di|rected
the Generals Sporcken and Oberg to advance
again&s;t them by the way of Crevelt and St. Anthony, and,
in particular, to make the mo&s;t of their artillery, that,
being employed in three different places at once, they
might be prevented from &s;ending any re-enforcement to
the left, where the chief attack was intended. The&s;e pre|cautions
being taken, Prince Ferdinand, putting him&s;elf
at the head of the grenadiers of the right wing, continued
<PB N="316" REF="320">
his march in two columns to the village of Anrath, where
he fell in with an advanced party of the French, which,
after a few di&s;charges of mu&s;quetry, retired to their camp
and gave the alarm. In the mean time, both armies were
drawn up in order of battle; the troops of the allies in the
plain between the villages of Anrath and Willich, oppo|&s;ite
to the French forces, who&s;e left was covered with a
wood. The action began about one in the afternoon,
with a &s;evere cannonading on the part of Prince Ferdi|nand,
which, though well &s;upported, proved ineffectual in
drawing the enemy from their cover: he, therefore, deter|mined
to di&s;lodge them from the wood by dint of &s;mall
arms. The Hereditary Prince immediately advanced with
the whole front, and a very ob&s;tinate action enfucd. Mean
while, the cavalry on the right in vain attempted to pe|netrate
the wood on the other &s;ide, where the enemy had
rai&s;ed two batteries, which were &s;u&s;tained by forty &s;qua|drons
of hor&s;e. After a terrible fire had been maintained
on both &s;ides, till five in the afternoon, the grenadiers
forced the entrenchments in the wood, which were lined
by the French infantry. The&s;e giving way abandoned
the wood in the utmo&s;t di&s;order; but the pur&s;uit was
checked by the conduct and re&s;olution of the enemy's ca|valry,
which, notwith&s;tanding a dreadful fire from the ar|tillery
of the allies, maintained their ground, and covered
the foot in their retreat to Nuys. The &s;ucce&s;s of the
day was, in a good mea&s;ure, owing to the artillery on the
left and in the centre, with which the Generals Sporcken
and Oberg had done great execution, and employed the
attention of the enemy on that &s;ide, while Prince Ferdi|nand
pro&s;ecuted his attack on the other quarter. It mu&s;t
be owned, however, that their right wing and centre re|tired
in great order to Nuys, though the left was de|feated,
with the lo&s;s of &s;ome &s;tandards, colours, and pieces
of cannon, and &s;ix thou&s;and men killed, wounded, or
taken pri&s;oners<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Among the French officers who lo&s;t their lives in this engagement was the Count de Gi&s;ors, only &s;on of the Mare&s;chal Duke de Bellei&s;le, and la&s;t hope of that illu&s;trious family, a young nobleman of extraordinary accompli&s;h|ments, who fini&s;hed a &s;hort life of honour in the embrace of military glory, and fell gallantly fighting at the head of his own regiment, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible grief of his aged father, and the univer&s;al regret of his country.</NOTE>. This victory, however, which co&s;t
<PB N="317" REF="321">
the allies about fifteen hundred men, was not at all deci|&s;ive
in its con&s;equences; and, indeed, the plan &s;eemed
only calculated to di&s;play the enterpri&s;ing genius of the
Hanoverian general. True it is, the French army took
refuge under the cannon of Cologn, where they remained,
without hazarding any &s;tep for the relief of Du&s;&s;eldorp,
which Prince Ferdinand immediately inve&s;ted, and in a
few days reduced, the garri&s;on being allowed to march
out with the honours of war, on condition that they
&s;hould not, for the &s;pace of one year, carry arms again&s;t
the allies.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. It was at this period that Count de Clermont
re&s;igned his command, which was conferred upon M. de
Contades, and the French army was con&s;iderably re-en|forced.
He even threatened to attack Prince Ferdinand
in his turn, and made &s;ome motions with that de&s;ign,
but was prevented by the little river Erff, behind which
the prince re&s;olved to lie quiet, until he &s;hould be joined
by the body of Briti&s;h troops under the command of the
Duke of Marlborough, the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of which had ju&s;t
landed at Embden. He flattered him&s;elf that the Prince
of Y &s;enbourg, at the head of the He&s;&s;ian troops, would
find employment for the Prince de Soubi&s;e, who had
marched from Hanau, with a de&s;ign to penetrate into the
landgraviate of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el: his vanguard had been al|ready
&s;urpri&s;ed and defeated by the militia of the country;
and the Prince of Y&s;enbourg was at the head of a con&s;i|derable
body of regular forces, a&s;&s;embled to oppo&s;e his fur|ther
progre&s;s. Prince Ferdinand, therefore, hoped that
the operations of the French general would be effectually
impeded, until he him&s;elf, being joined by the Briti&s;h
troops, &s;hould be in a condition to pa&s;s the Meu&s;e, transfer
the &s;eat of war into the enemy's country, thus make a di|ver&s;ion
from the Rhine, and perhaps oblige the Prince de
Soubi&s;e to come to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the principal French
<PB N="318" REF="322">
army, commanded by M. de Contades. He had formed a plan
which would have an&s;wered the&s;e purpo&s;es effectually, and,
in execution of it, marched to Ruremond on the Mae&s;e,
when his mea&s;ures were totally di&s;concerted by a variety
of incidents which he could not fore&s;ee. The Prince of
Y&s;enbourg was, on the twenty-third day of July, defeated
at Sangar&s;hau&s;en by the Duke de Broglio, whom the
Prince de Soubi&s;e had detached again&s;t him with a num|ber
of troops greatly &s;uperior to that which the He&s;&s;ian
general commanded. The Duke de Broglio, who command|ed
the corps that formed the vanguard of Soubi&s;e's army,
having learned at Ca&s;&s;el, that the He&s;&s;ian troops, under
the Prince of Y&s;enbourg, were retiring towards Munden,
he advanced, on the twenty-third of July, with a body of
eight thou&s;and men, to the village of Sangar&s;hau&s;en, where
he found them drawn up in order of battle, and forthwith
made a di&s;po&s;ition for the attack. At fir&s;t his cavalry
were repul&s;ed by the He&s;&s;ian hor&s;e, which charged the
French infantry, and were broke in their turn. The
He&s;&s;ians, though greatly inferior in number to the enemy,
made a very ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, by favour of a rock in
the Fulde that covered their right, and a wood by which
their left was &s;ecured. The di&s;pute was &s;o ob&s;tinate, that
the enemy's left was obliged to give ground, but the Duke
de Broglio ordering a fre&s;h corps to advance, changed
the fortune of the day. The He&s;&s;ians, overpowered by
numbers, gave way; part plunged into the river, where
many peri&s;hed, and part threw them&s;elves into the wood,
through which they e&s;caped from the pur&s;uit of the hu&s;|&s;ars,
who took above two hundred &s;oldiers and fifty offi|cers,
including the Count de Canitz, who was &s;econd in
command. They likewi&s;e &s;ound on the field of battle
&s;even pieces of cannon, and eight at Munden: but the car|nage
was pretty con&s;iderable, and nearly equal on both
&s;ides. The number of the killed and wounded, on the
&s;ide of the French, exceeded two thou&s;and; the lo&s;s of the
He&s;&s;ians was not &s;o great. The Prince of Y&s;enbourg
having collected the remains of his little army, took po&s;t
<PB N="319" REF="323">
at Eimbeck, where he &s;oon was re-enforced, and found
him&s;elf at the head of twelve thou&s;and men: but, in con|&s;equence
of this advantage, the enemy became ma&s;ters of
the We&s;er, and opened to them&s;elves a free pa&s;&s;age into
We&s;tphalia.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. The progre&s;s of Prince Ferdinand upon the
Mae&s;e had been retarded by a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of heavy
rains, which broke up the roads, and rendered the country
impa&s;&s;able; and now the certain information of this un|lucky
check left him no alternative but a battle or a re|treat
acro&s;s the Rhine: the fir&s;t was carefully avoided by
the enemy; the latter re&s;olution, therefore, he found
him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity to embrace. In his pre&s;ent po|&s;ition
he was hampered by the French army on one wing,
on the other by the fortre&s;s of Gueldres, the garri&s;on of
which had been lately re-enforced, as well as by divers
other po&s;ts, capable of ob&s;tructing the convoys and &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
of the combined army: be&s;ides, he had rea&s;on to
apprehend that the Prince de Soubi&s;e would endeavour to
intercept the Briti&s;h troops in their march from Embden.
Induced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he determined to repa&s;s
the Rhine, after having offered battle to the enemy, and
made &s;everal motions for that purpo&s;e. Finding them
aver&s;e to an engagement, he made his di&s;po&s;itions for
forcing the &s;trong pa&s;s of Wachtendonck, an i&s;land &s;ur|rounded
by the Niers, of very difficult approach, and
&s;ituated exactly in his route to the Rhine. This &s;ervice
was performed by the Hereditary Prince of Brun&s;wick,
who, perceiving the enemy had drawn up the bridge,
ru&s;hed into the river at the head of his grenadiers, who
drove them away with their bayonets, and cleared the
bridges for the pa&s;&s;age of the army towards Rhinebergen.
At this place Prince Ferdinand received intelligence that
M. de Chevert, reputed one of the be&s;t officers in the
French &s;ervice, had pa&s;&s;ed the Lippe with fourteen bat|talions
and &s;everal &s;quadrons, to join the garri&s;on of We|&s;el,
and fall upon Lieutenant-General Imho&s;&s;, who com|manded
a detached corps of the combined army at Meer,
that he might be at hand to guard the bridge which the
<PB N="320" REF="324">
prince had thrown over the Rhine at Rees. His Serene
Highne&s;s was extremely de&s;irous of &s;ending &s;uccours to
General Imhoff; but the troops were too much fatigued
to begin another march before morning; and the Rhine
had overflowed its banks in &s;uch a manner as to render
the bridge at Rees impa&s;&s;able, &s;o that M. Imhoff was left
to the re&s;ources of his own conduct and the bravery of his
troops, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix battalions and four &s;quadrons,
already weakened by the ab&s;ence of different detachments.
This general having received advice, on the fourth of Au|gu&s;t,
that the enemy intended to pa&s;s the Lippe the &s;ame
evening with a con&s;iderable train of artillery, in order to
burn the bridge at Rees, decamped with a view to cover
this place, and join two battalions which had pa&s;&s;ed the
Rhine in boats, under the command of General Za&s;trow,
who re-enforced him accordingly; but the enemy not ap|pearing,
he concluded the information was fal&s;e, and re|&s;olved
to re&s;ume his advantageous po&s;t at Meer. Of this
he had no &s;ooner repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, than his advanced
guards were engaged with the enemy, who marched
to the attack from We&s;el, under the command of Lieu|tenant-General
de Chevert, con&s;i&s;ting of the whole corps
intended for the &s;iege of Du&s;&s;eldorp. Imhoff's front was
covered by coppices and ditches, there being a ri&s;ing
ground on his right, from whence he could plainly di&s;cern
the whole force that advanced again&s;t him, together with
the manner of their approach. Perceiving them engaged
in that difficult ground, he po&s;ted one regiment in a cop|pice,
with orders to fall upon the left &s;lank of the enemy&punc;
which appeared quite uncovered; and as &s;oon as their fire
began, advanced with the re&s;t of his $orces to attack them
in front. The bayonet was u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, and
the charge given with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity and re&s;olution,
that, after a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance, the enemy fell into confu&s;ion
and &s;led towards We&s;el, leaving on the &s;pot eleven piece
of cannon, with a great number of waggons and other
carriages: be&s;ides the killed and wounded, who amounted
to a pretty con&s;iderable number, the victor took three hun|dred
and fifty-four pri&s;oners, including eleven officers;
<PB N="321" REF="325">
whereas, on his part, the victory was purcha&s;ed at a very
&s;mall expen&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. Immediately after this action, General
Wangenheim pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine with &s;everal &s;quadrons and
battalions, to re-enforce General Imhoff, and enable him
to pro&s;ecute the advantage he had gained, while Prince
Ferdinand marched with the re&s;t of the army to Santen:
from thence he proceeded to Rhineberg, where he intend|ed
to pa&s;s; but the river had overflowed to &s;uch a degree,
that here, as well as at Rees, the &s;hore was inacce&s;&s;ible;
&s;o that he &s;ound it nece&s;&s;ary to march farther down the
river, and lay a bridge at Gtiethuyzen. The enemy had
contrived four ve&s;&s;els for the de&s;truction of this bridge; but
they were all taken before they could put the de&s;ign in
execution, and the whole army pa&s;&s;ed on the tenth day of
Augu&s;t, without any lo&s;s or further interruption. At
the &s;ame time the prince withdrew his garri&s;on from Du&s;|&s;eldorp,
of which the French immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.
Immediately after his pa&s;&s;age he received a letter from the
Duke of Marlborough, acquainting him that the Briti&s;h
troops had arrived at Lingen, in their route to Coesfeldt:
to which place General Imhoff was &s;ent to receive them,
with a &s;trong detachment. Notwith&s;tanding this junction,
the two armies on the Rhine were &s;o equally matched,
that no &s;troke of importance was &s;truck on either &s;ide dur|ing
the remaining part of the campaign. M. de Contades,
&s;eeing no pro&s;pect of obtaining the lea&s;t advantage over
Prince Ferdinand, detached Prince Xaverius of Saxony
with a &s;trong re-enforcement to the Prince de Soubi&s;e,
who had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gottengen, and &s;eemed de|termined
to attack the Prince of Y&s;enbourg at Eimbeck.
That this officer might be able to give him a proper recep|tion,
Prince Ferdinand detached General Oberg with ten
thou&s;and men to Lip&s;tadt, from whence, &s;hould occa&s;ion
require, they might continue their march, and join the
He&s;&s;ians. The whole body, when thus re-enforced, did
not exceed twenty thou&s;and men, of whom General
Oberg now a&s;&s;umed the command: whereas the troops of
<PB N="322" REF="326">
Soubi&s;e were increa&s;ed to the number of thirty thou&s;and.
The allies had taken po&s;t upon the river Fulde at San|der&s;haufen,
where they hoped the French would attack
them; but the de&s;ign of Soubi&s;e was fir&s;t to di&s;lodge them
from that advantageous &s;ituation. With this view, he
made a motion, as if he had intended to turn the camp of
the allies by the road of Munden. In order to prevent
the execution of this &s;uppo&s;ed de&s;ign, General Oberg de|camped
on the tenth of October, and, pa&s;&s;ing by the vil|lage
of Landwernhagen, advanced towards Luttenberg,
where, under&s;tanding the enemy were at his heels, he forth|with
formed his troops in order of battle, his right to the
Fulde, and his left extending to a thicket upon an emi|nence,
where he planted five field-pieces. The cavalry
&s;upported the wings in a third line, the village of Lutten|berg
was in the rear, and four pieces of cannon were
mounted on a ri&s;ing ground that flanked this village. The
French having likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed Landwernhagen, po&s;ted
their left towards the Fulde, their right extending far
beyond the left of the allies, and their front being
&s;trengthened with above thirty pieces of cannon. At four
in the afternoon the enemy began the battle with a &s;evere
cannonading, and at the &s;ame time the fir&s;t line of their
infantry attacked Major-General Za&s;trow, who was
po&s;ted on the left wing of the allies. This body of the
French was repul&s;ed; but in the &s;ame moment, a con&s;i|derable
line of cavalry advancing, charged the allies in
front and &s;lank. The&s;e were &s;upported by a fre&s;h body of
infantry with cannon, which, after a warm di&s;pute,
obliged the confederates to give way; and General Oberg,
in order to prevent a total defeat, made a di&s;po&s;ition for a
retreat, which was performed in tolerable order; not but
that he &s;u$$ered greatly, in pa&s;&s;ing through a defile, from
the fire of the enemy's cannon, which was brought up,
and managed under the direction of the Duke de Broglio.
Having marched through Munden, by midnight, the re|tiring
army lay till morning under arms in the little plain
near Grupen, on the other &s;ide of the We&s;er; but at day-break
<PB N="323" REF="327">
pro&s;ecuted their march, after having withdrawn the
garri&s;on from Munden, until they arrived in the neigh|bourhood
of Gunter&s;heim, where they encamped. In
this engagement General Oberg lo&s;t about fifteen hundred
men, his artillery, baggage, and ammunition. He was
obliged to abandon a magazine of hay and &s;traw at Mun|den,
and leave part of his wounded men in that place to
the humanity of the victor. But, after all, the French
general reaped very little advantage from his victory.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. By this time Prince Ferdinand had retired into
We&s;tphalia, and fixed his head-quarters at Mun&s;ter, while
M. Contades encamped near Ham upon the Lippe: &s;o
that, although he had obliged the French army to evacuate
Hanover and He&s;&s;e in the beginning of the year, when
they were weakened by death and di&s;temper, and even
driven them beyond the Rhine, where they &s;u&s;tained a de|feat;
yet they were &s;oon put in a condition to baffle all
his future endeavours, and penetrate again into We&s;tphalia,
where they e&s;tabli&s;hed their winter-quarters, extending
them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner as to command the whole
cour&s;e of the Rhine on both &s;ides, while the allies were
di&s;po&s;ed in the landgraviate of He&s;&s;ie-Ca&s;&s;el, and in the
bi&s;hoprick of Mun&s;ter, Paderborn, and Hilde&s;heim.
The Briti&s;h troops had joined them &s;o late in the &s;ea&s;on,
that they had no opportunity to &s;ignalize them&s;elves in
the field; yet the fatigues of the campaign, which they
had &s;everely felt, proved fatal to their commander, the
Duke of Marlborough, who died of a dy&s;entery at Mun|&s;ter,
univer&s;ally lamented.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. Having thus particulari&s;ed the operations of
the allied army &s;ince the commencement of the campaign,
we &s;hall now endeavour to trace the &s;teps of the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia, from the period at which his army was a&s;&s;embled
for action. Having collected his &s;orce as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on
would permit, he undertook the &s;iege of Schweidnitz in
form on the twenty-fir&s;t day of March; and carried on
his operations with &s;uch vigour, that in thirteen days the
garri&s;on &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, after
<PB N="324" REF="328">
having lo&s;t one half of their number in the defence of the
place. While one part of his troops were engaged in this
&s;ervice, he him&s;elf, at the head of another, advanced to
the ea&s;tern frontier of Bohemia, and &s;ent a detachment as
far as Trautenaw, garri&s;oned by a body of Au&s;trians, who,
after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, abandoned the place, and
retreated towards their grand army. By this &s;ucce&s;s he
opened to him&s;elf a way into Bohemia, by which he poured
in detachments of light troops, to rai&s;e contributions,
and harra&s;s the out-po&s;ts of the enemy. At the &s;ame time
the Baron de la Mothe Fouquet marched with another
body again&s;t the Au&s;trian General Jahnus, po&s;ted in the
county of Glatz, whom he obliged to abandon all the
po&s;ts he occupied in that country, and pur&s;ued as far as
Nachod, within twenty miles of Koning&s;gratz, where
the grand Au&s;trian army was encamped, under the com|mand
of Mare&s;chal Daun, who had lately arrived from
Vienna.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">At this juncture the Pru&s;&s;ian commandant of Dre&s;den being admitted into the Japan palace, to &s;ee the curious procelaine with which it is adorned, perceived a door built up; and ordering the pa&s;&s;age to be opened, entered a large apartment, where he found three thou&s;and tents, and other field uten&s;ils. The&s;e had been concealed here when the Pru&s;&s;ians fir&s;t took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city: they were immediately &s;ei&s;ed by the commandant, and di&s;tributed among the troops of Prince Henry's army.</NOTE>. Over and above the&s;e excur&s;ions, the King
ordered a body of thirty thou&s;and men to be a&s;&s;embled, to
act under the command of his brother Prince Henry, an
accompli&s;hed warrior, again&s;t the army of the Empire,
which the Prince de Deuxponts, with great difficulty,
made a &s;hift to form again near Bamberg, in Franconia.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who&s;e de&s;igns were
perhaps even greater than he cared to own, re&s;olved to &s;hift
the theatre of the war, and penetrate into Moravia, a
fertile country, which had hitherto been kept &s;acred from
ravage and contribution. Having formed an army of fifty
thou&s;and choice troops, near Nie&s;s, in Sile&s;ia, he divided
them into three columns; the fir&s;t commanded by Mare&s;chal
Keith, the &s;econd by him&s;elf in per&s;on, and the third con|ducted
by Prince Maurice of Anhault De&s;&s;au. In the
<PB N="325" REF="329">
latter end of April they began their march towards Mo|ravia;
and General De la Ville, who commanded a body
of troops in that country, retired as they advanced, after
having thrown a &s;trong re-enforcement into Olmutz,
which the King was determined to be&s;iege. Had he pa&s;&s;ed
by this fortre&s;s, which was &s;trongly fortified, and well
provided for a vigorous defence, he might have advanced
to the gates of Vienna, and reduced the Emperor to the
nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uing for peace on his own terms; but it
&s;eems he was unwilling to deviate &s;o far from the common
maxims of war as to leave a fortified place in the rear;
and, therefore, he determined to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it
before he &s;hould proceed. For this purpo&s;e it was imme|diately
inve&s;ted: orders were i&s;&s;ued to ha&s;ten up the heavy
artillery, and Mare&s;chal Keith was appointed to &s;uper|intend
and direct the operations of the &s;iege. Meanwhile,
the Au&s;trian commander, Count Daun, being informed
of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's motions and de&s;igns, quitted his
camp at Leutomy&s;&s;el in Bohemia, and entered Moravia by
the way of Billa. Being &s;till too weak to encounter the
Pru&s;&s;ians in the field, he extended his troops in the neigh|bourhood
of the King's army, between Gewitz and
Littau, in a mountainous &s;ituation, where he ran little
or no ri&s;k of being attacked. Here he remained for &s;ome
time in quiet, with the fertile country of Bohemia in his
rear, from whence he drew plentiful &s;upplies, and re|ceived
daily re-enforcements. His &s;cheme was to relieve
the be&s;ieged occa&s;ionally, to harra&s;s the be&s;iegers, and to
intercept their convoys from Sile&s;ia; and this &s;cheme &s;uc|ceeded
to his wi&s;h. Olmutz is &s;o exten&s;ive in its works,
and &s;o peculiarly &s;ituated on the river Morava, that it
could not be completely inve&s;ted without weakening the
po&s;ts of the be&s;ieging army, by extending them to a pro|digious
circuit; &s;o that, in &s;ome parts, they were ea&s;ily
forced by detachments in the nights, who fell upon them
&s;uddenly, and &s;eldom failed to introduce into the place
&s;upplies of men, provi&s;ions, and ammunition. The forage
in the neighbourhood of the city having been previou&s;$y
<PB N="326" REF="330">
de&s;troyed, the Pru&s;&s;ian hor&s;e were obliged to make ex|cur&s;ions
at a great di&s;tance, con&s;equently expo&s;ed to fa|tigue,
and liable to &s;urpri&s;e; and, in a word, the Pru&s;&s;ians
were not very expert in the art of town taking.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. Count Daun knew how to take advantage
of the&s;e circum&s;tances, without hazarding a battle, to
which the King provoked him in vain. While the garri|&s;on
made repeated &s;allies to retard the operations of the
be&s;iegers, the Au&s;trian general harra&s;&s;ed their foraging
parties, fell upon different quarters of their army in the
night, and kept them in continual alarm. Neverthele&s;s,
the King fini&s;hed his fir&s;t parallel; and proceeded with
&s;uch vigour as &s;eemed to promi&s;e a &s;peedy reduction of the
place, when his de&s;ign was entirely fru&s;trated by an un|toward
incident. Mare&s;chal Daun, having received in|telligence
that a large convoy had &s;et out from Sile&s;ia for
the Pru&s;&s;ian camp, re&s;olved to &s;ei&s;e this opportunity of
compelling the King to de&s;i&s;t from his enterpri&s;e. He &s;ent
General Jahnus, with a &s;trong body of troops, towards
Bahrn, and another detachment to Stadtoliebe, with in|&s;tructions
to attack the convoy on different &s;ides; while
he him&s;elf advanced towards the be&s;iegers, as if he in|tended
to give them battle. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, far
from being deceived by this feint, began, from the motions
of the Au&s;trian general, to &s;u&s;pect his real &s;cheme, and
immediately di&s;patched General Ziethen, with a &s;trong
re-enforcement, to protect the convoy, which was e&s;corted
by eight battalions, and about four thou&s;and men, who had
been &s;ick, and were ju&s;t recovered. Before this officer join|ed
them, the convoy had been attacked on the twenty-eighth
day of June; but the a&s;&s;ailants were repul&s;ed with
con&s;iderable lo&s;s. Mare&s;chal Daun, however, took care
that they &s;hould be immediately re-enforced; and next
day the attack was renewed with much greater effect.
Four hundred waggons, guarded by four battalions, and
about one thou&s;and troopers, had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed the de&s;iles of
Dom&s;tadt, when the Au&s;trians charged them furiou&s;ly on
every &s;ide: the communication between the head and the
<PB N="327" REF="331">
re&s;t of the convoy was cut off; and General Ziethen,
after having exerted all his efforts for its pre&s;ervation, be|ing
obliged to abandon the waggons, retired to Troppau.
Thus the whole convoy fell into the hands of the enemy,
who took above &s;ix hundred pri&s;oners, together with
General Putkammer; and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was obliged
to relinqui&s;h his enterpri&s;e. This was a mortifying ne|ce&s;&s;ity
to a prince of his high &s;pirit, at a time when he &s;aw
him&s;elf on the eve of reducing the place, notwith&s;tanding
the gallant defence which had been made by General Mar|&s;hal,
the governor. Nothing now remained but to rai&s;e
the &s;iege, and retire without lo&s;s in the face of a vigilant
enemy, prepared to &s;ei&s;e every opportunity of advantage:
a ta&s;k which, how hard &s;oever it may appear, he per|formed
with equal dexterity and &s;ucce&s;s. In&s;tead of re|tiring
into Sile&s;ia, he re&s;olved to avert the war from his
own dominions, and take the route of Bohemia, the
frontiers of which were left uncovered by Mare&s;chal Daun's
la&s;t motion, when he advanced his quarters to Po&s;nitz, in
order to &s;uccour Olmutz the more effectually. After the
King had taken his mea&s;ures, he carefully concealed his
de&s;ign from the enemy, and, notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s of
his convoy, pro&s;ecuted the operations of the &s;iege with
redoubled vigour, till the fir&s;t day of July, when he de|camped
in the night, and began his march to Bohemia.
He him&s;elf, with one divi&s;ion, took the road to Konitz;
and Mare&s;chal Keith having brought away all the artillery,
except four mortars, and one di&s;abled cannon, pur&s;ued his
march by the way of Littau to Muglitz and Tribau.
Although his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had gained an entire march
upon the Au&s;trians, their light troops, commanded by
the Generals Buccow and Laudohn, did not fail to attend
and harra&s;s his army in their retreat; but their endeavours
were in a great mea&s;ure fru&s;trated by the conduct and cir|cum&s;pection
of the Pru&s;&s;ian commanders. After the rear
of the army had pa&s;&s;ed the defiles of Krenau, General
La&s;ci, who was po&s;ted at Gibau with a large body of
Au&s;trian troops, occupied the village of Krenau with a
<PB N="328" REF="332">
detachment of grenadiers, who were &s;oon di&s;lodged; and
the Pru&s;&s;ians pur&s;ued their march by Zwittau to Leuto|my&s;&s;el,
where they &s;ei&s;ed a magazine of meal and &s;orage.
In the mean time, General de Ratzow, who conducted
the provi&s;ions and artillery, found the hills of Hollitz
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the enemy, who cannonaded him as he ad|vanced;
but Mare&s;chal Keith coming up, ordered them
to be attacked in the rear, and they fled into a wood with
precipitation, with the lo&s;s of &s;ix officers and three hun|dred
men, who were taken pri&s;oners. While the Mare|&s;chal
was thus employed, the King proceeded from Leu|tomy&s;&s;el
to Konin&s;gratz, where General Buccow, who
had got the &s;tart of him, was po&s;ted with &s;even thou&s;and
men behind the Elbe, and in the entrenchments which
they had thrown up all round the city. The Pru&s;&s;ian
troops as they arrived pa&s;&s;ed over the little river Adler,
and as the enemy had broken down the bridges over the
Elbe, the King ordered them to be repaired with all ex|pedition,
being determined to attack the Au&s;trian en|trenchments:
but General Buccow did not wait for his
approach. He abandoned his entrenchments, and retired
with his troops to Clumetz; &s;o that the King took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of the mo&s;t important po&s;t of Koning&s;gratz without
further oppo&s;ition. An Au&s;trian corps having taken po&s;t
between him and Hollitz, in order to ob&s;truct the march
of the artillery, he advanced again&s;t them in per&s;on, and
having driven them from the place, all his cannon, mili|tary
&s;tores, provi&s;ion, with fifteen hundred &s;ick and
wounded men, arrived in &s;afety at Koning&s;gratz, where
the whole army encamped. His intention was to transfer
the &s;eat of war from Moravia to Bohemia, where he
&s;hould be able to maintain a more ea&s;y communication
with his own dominions: but a more powerful motive
&s;oon obliged him to change his re&s;olution.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. After the Ru&s;&s;ian troops under Apraxin had
retreated from Pomerania in the cour&s;e of the preceding
year, and the Czarina &s;eemed ready to change her &s;y&s;tem,
the courts of Vienna and Ver&s;ailles had, by dint of &s;ub&s;i|dies,
<PB N="329" REF="333">
promi&s;es, pre&s;ents, and intrigues, attached her, in
all appearance, more firmly than ever to the confederacy,
and even induced her to augment the number of troops
de&s;tined to act again&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch. She not
only &s;igned her acce&s;&s;ion in form to the quadruple alliance
with the Empre&s;s-Queen and the Kings of France and
Sweden; but, in order to manife&s;t her zeal to the com|mon
cau&s;e, &s;he di&s;graced her chancellor, Count Be&s;tuchef,
who was &s;uppo&s;ed aver&s;e to the war: &s;he divided her
forces into &s;eparate bodies, under the command of the
Generals Fermer and Browne, and ordered them to put
their troops in motion in the middle of winter. Fermer
accordingly began his march in the beginning of January,
and on the twenty-&s;econd his light troops took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Koning&s;berg, the capital of Pru&s;&s;ia, without oppo|&s;ition;
for the King's &s;orces had quitted that country,
in order to pro&s;ecute the war in the we&s;tern parts of Pome|rania.
They did not, however, maintain them&s;elves in
this part of the country; but, after having ravaged &s;ome
di&s;tricts, returned to the main body, which halted on the
Vi&s;tula, to the no &s;mall di&s;turbance of the city of Dant|zick.
The re&s;ident of the Czarina actually demanded
that the magi&s;trates &s;hould receive a Ru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on: a
demand which they not only peremptorily refu&s;ed, but
ordered all the citizens to arms, and took every other
method to provide for their defence. At length, after
&s;ome negociation with General Fermer, the a&s;&s;air was
compromi&s;ed: he de&s;i&s;ted from the demand, and part of
his troops pa&s;&s;ed the Vi&s;tula, &s;eemingly to invade Pome|rania,
in the ea&s;tern part of which Count Dohna had
a&s;&s;embled an army of Pru&s;&s;ians to oppo&s;e their progre&s;s.
But after they had pillaged the open country, they rejoin|ed
their main body; and General Fermer, turning to the
left, advanced toward Sile&s;ia, in order to co-operate with
the other Ru&s;&s;ian army commanded by Browne, who had
taken his route through Poland, and already pa&s;&s;ed the
Po&s;na. By the fir&s;t of July, both bodies had reached the
frontiers of Sile&s;ia, and &s;ome of their co&s;&s;acks, penetrating
<PB N="330" REF="334">
into that province, had committed dreadful ravages, and
overwhelmed the inhabitants with con&s;ternation. Count
Dohna, with the Pru&s;&s;ian army under his command, had
attended their motions, and even pa&s;&s;ed the Oder at Frank|fort,
as if he had intended to give them battle: but he was
too much inferior in number to hazard &s;uch a &s;tep, which
became an object of his &s;overeign's own per&s;onal attention.
Mare&s;chal Daun had followed the King into Bohemia,
and, on the twenty-&s;econd day of July, encamped on the
hills of Libi&s;chau, a &s;ituation almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, where he
re&s;olved to remain, and watch the motions of the Pru&s;&s;ian
monarch, until &s;ome opportunity &s;hould offer of acting to
advantage. Nature &s;eems to have expre&s;sly formed this
commander with talents to penetrate the de&s;igns, embar|ra&s;s
the genius, and check the impetuo&s;ity of the Pru&s;&s;ian
monarch. He was ju&s;tly compared to Fabius Maximus,
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the epithet of Cunctator. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
all the vigilance, caution, and &s;agacity of that celebrated
Roman. Like him, he hovered on the &s;kirts of the enemy,
harra&s;&s;ing their parties, accu&s;toming the &s;oldiers to &s;trict
di&s;cipline, hard &s;ervice, and the face of a formidable foe,
and watching for opportunities, which he knew how to
&s;ei&s;e with equal courage and celerity.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, being induced by a
concurrence of motives to &s;top the progre&s;s of the Ru&s;&s;ians
in Sile&s;ia, made his di&s;po&s;itions for retreating from Bohe|mia,
and on the twenty-fifth day of July quitted the camp
at Koning&s;gratz. He was attended in his march by three
thou&s;and Au&s;trian light troops, who did not fail to in|commode
his rear: but notwith&s;tanding the&s;e impediments,
he pa&s;&s;ed the Mittau, proceeded on his route, and on the
ninth day of Augu&s;t arrived at Land&s;hut. From thence
he ha&s;tened with a detachment towards Frankfort on the
Oder, and joined the army commanded by Lieutenant-General
Dohna at Gorgas. Then the whole army pa&s;&s;ed
the Oder by a bridge thrown over it at Gatavi&s;e, and
having re&s;ted one day, advanced to Dertmitzel, where he
encamped. The Ru&s;&s;ians, under General Fermer, were
<PB N="331" REF="335">
po&s;ted on the other &s;ide of the little river Mitzel, their
right extending to the village of Zwicker, and their left to
Quertchem. The King being determined to hazard a
battle, pa&s;&s;ed the Mitzel on the twenty-fifth in the morn|ing,
and turning the flank of the enemy, drew up his army
in order of battle in the plain between the little river
and the town of Zorndorf. The Ru&s;&s;ians, by whom he
was out-numbered, did not decline the di&s;pute; but as
the ground did not permit them to extend them&s;elves, they
appeared in four lines, forming a front on every &s;ide, de|fended
by cannon and a chevaux-de-fri&s;e, their right flank
covered by the village of Zwicker. After a warm cannon|ade,
the Pru&s;&s;ian infantry were ordered to attack the village,
and a body of grenadiers advanced to the a&s;&s;ault; but this
brigade unexpectedly giving way, occa&s;ioned a con&s;ider|able
opening in the line, and left the whole left flank of
the infantry uncovered. Before the enemy could take
advantage of this incident, the interval was filled up by the
cavalry under the command of General Seydlitz; and the
King, with his u&s;ual pre&s;ence of mind, &s;ub&s;tituted another
choice body of troops to carry on the attack. This began
about noon, and continued for &s;ome time, during which
both &s;ides fought with equal courage and per&s;everance:
at length General Scydlitz, having routed the Ru&s;&s;ian
cavalry, fell upon the flank of the infantry with great fury,
which being al&s;o dreadfully annoyed by the Pru&s;&s;ian ar|tillery,
they abandoned the village, together with their
military che&s;t, and great part of their baggage. Notwith|&s;tanding
this lo&s;s, which had greatly di&s;ordered their right
wing, they continued to &s;tand their ground, and terrible
havock was made among them, not only with the &s;word
and bayonet, but al&s;o by the cannon, which were loaded
with grape-&s;hot, and being excellently &s;erved, did great
execution. Towards evening the confu&s;ion among them
increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that in all probability they
would have been entirely routed, had they not been favour|ed
by the approaching darkne&s;s, as well as by a particular
operation, which was very gallantly performed. One of
<PB N="332" REF="336">
the Ru&s;&s;ian generals perceiving the fortune of the day
turned again&s;t them, rallied a &s;elect body of troops, and
made a vigorous impre&s;&s;ion on the right wing of the Pru&s;|&s;ians.
This effort diverted their attention &s;o &s;trongly to
that quarter, that the right of the Ru&s;&s;ians enjoyed a
re&s;pite, during which they retired in tolerable order,
and occupied a new po&s;t on the right, where the re&s;t of
their forces were the more ea&s;ily a&s;&s;embled. In this battle
they are &s;aid to have lo&s;t above fifteen thou&s;and men, thir|ty-&s;even
colours, five &s;tandards, twelve mortars, the great|er
part of their baggage, and above one hundred pieces of
cannon. Among the pri&s;oners that fell into the hands of
the victor, were &s;everal general officers, and a good num|ber
lo&s;t their lives on the field of battle. The victory co&s;t
the King above two thou&s;and men, including &s;ome officers
of di&s;tinction, particularly two aids-du-camp, who at|tended
his own per&s;on, which he expo&s;ed without &s;cruple
to all the perils of the day. It would have redounded &s;till
more to his glory, had he put a &s;top to the carnage; for
after all re&s;i&s;tance was at an end, the wretched Ru&s;&s;ians
were hewn down without mercy. It mu&s;t be owned,
indeed, that the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers were in a peculiar manner
exa&s;perated again&s;t this enemy, becau&s;e they had laid wa&s;te
the country, burned the villages, ruined the pea&s;ants, and
committed many horrid acts of barbarity, which the
practice of war could not authori&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>A detail of the cruelties committed by tho&s;e barbarians cannot be read without horrour. They not only burned a great number of villages, but they ravi&s;hed, rifled, murthered, and mutilated the inhabitants, without di&s;tinc|tion of age or &s;ex, without any other provocation or incitement than brutal&punc; Ju&s;t and wantonne&s;s of barbarity. They even violated the $word$ of the dead, which have been held &s;acred among the mo&s;t &s;avage nations. At Ca|min and Breckholtz they forced open the graves and &s;epulchral vaults, and &s;tripped the bodies of the General$ Sclaberndorf and Ruitz, which had been depo&s;ited there. But the collected force of their vengea$ce was di&s;charged again&s;t Cu&s;trin, the capital of the New Marche of Brandenburgh, &s;ituated at the con$lux of the Warta and the Oder, about fifteen Engli&s;h miles from Frankfort. The particulars of the di&s;a&s;ter that be&s;ell this city are patheti|cally related in the following extracts from a letter written by an inhabitant $word$ eye-witne&s;s:</P>
<P>&startq;On the thirteenth of Augu&s;t, about three o'clock in the afternoon a &s;udden report was &s;pread that a body of Ru&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars and co&s;&s;acks appeared in &s;ight of the little &s;uburb. All the people were immediately in motion, and the whole city was filled with terrour, e&s;pecially as we were certainly in|formed that the whole Ru&s;&s;ian army was advancing from Me&s;erick and Ko|tig&s;walda, by the way of Land&s;berg. A re-enforcement was immediately &s;ent to our piquet-guard in the &s;uburb, amounting, by this junction, to three hundred men, who were &s;oon attacked by the enemy, and the &s;kirmi&s;h la&s;t|ed from four till &s;even o'clock in the evening. During this di&s;pute, we could plainly perceive, from our ramparts and church-&s;teeple, &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, mounted on Engli&s;h hor&s;es, reconnoitring our fortification through per&s;pective gla&s;&s;es. They retired, however, when our cannon began to fire: then our piquet took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their former po&s;t in the &s;uburb; and the re-enforcement we had &s;ent from the city returned, after having broke down the bridge over the Oder. Next day Count Dohna, who command|ed the army near Frankfort, &s;ent in a re-enforcement of four battalions, ten &s;quadrons, and a &s;mall body of hu&s;&s;ars, under the command of Lieutenant-General Scherlemmer. The hu&s;&s;ars and a body of dragoons were added to the piquet of the little &s;uburb: the four battalions pitched their tents on the Anger, between the &s;uburb and the fortification; and the re&s;t of the dragoons remained in the field, to cover the long &s;uburb. General Scherlem|mer, attended by our governor, Colonel Schuck, went with a &s;mall party to ob&s;erve the enemy; but were obliged to retire, and were pur&s;ued by the co&s;&s;acks to the walls of the city. Between four and five o'clock next morn|ing the poor inhabitants were rou&s;ed from their &s;leep by the noi&s;e of the cannon, intermingled with the di&s;mal &s;hricks and hideous yellings of the co&s;&s;acks belonging to the Ru&s;&s;ian army. Alarmed at this horrid noi&s;e, I a&s;cended the church &s;teeple, from whence I beheld the whole plain, extend|ing from the little &s;uburb to the fore&s;t, covered with the enemy's troops, and our light hor&s;e, &s;upported by the infantry, engaged in different places with their irregulars. At eight I de&s;cried a body of the enemy's infantry, who&s;e ran con&s;i&s;ted of four or five thou&s;and men, advancing towards the vineyard in the neighbourhood of which they had rai&s;ed occa&s;ional $word$ in the preceding evening: from the&s;e they now played on our piquet-p$$rd and hu&s;&s; fars, who were obliged to retire. Then they fired, $span$ on the tents and baggage of the four battalions encamped on the Anger, who were al&s;o com|pelled to retreat. Having thus cleared the environs, they threw into the city &s;uch a number of bombs and red-hot bullets, that by nine in the morning it was &s;et on fire in three different places; and the &s;treets being narrow, burned with &s;uch &s;ury, that all our endeavours to extingui&s;h it proved ineffectual. At this time the whole atmo&s;phere appeared like a &s;hower of &s;iery rain and hail; and the mi&s;erable inhabitants thought of nothing but &s;aving their $word$ by running into the open fields. The whole place was filled with terrour and con&s;ternation, and re&s;ounded with the &s;hricks of women and children, who ran about in the utmo&s;t di&s;traction, expo&s;ed to the &s;hot and the bomb-&s;hells, which, bur&s;ting, tore in pieces every thing that &s;tood in their way. As I led my wi$e, with a young child in her arms, and drove the re&s;t of my children and &s;ervants half naked before me, tho&s;e in&s;truments of death and deva&s;ta|tion fell about us like hail; but, by the mercy of God, we all e&s;caped unhurt. Nothing could be more melancholy and affecting than a &s;ight of the wretch|ed people, flying in crouds, and leaving their all behind, while they rent the &s;ky with their lamentations. Many women of di&s;tinction I &s;aw without &s;hoes and &s;tockings, and almo&s;t without clothes, who had been rou&s;ed from their beds, and ran out naked into the &s;treets. When my family had reach|ed the open plain I endeavoured to return, and &s;ave &s;ome of my effects; but I could not force my way through a multitude of people, thronging out at the gate, &s;ome &s;ick and bed-ridden per&s;ons being carried on hor&s;eback and in carriages, and others conveyed on the backs of their friends, through a mo&s;t dreadful &s;cene of horrour and de&s;olation. A great number of families from the open country, and defencele&s;s towns in Pru&s;&s;ia and Pomerania, had come hither for &s;helter with their mo&s;t valuable effects, when the Ru&s;&s;ians fir&s;t entered the king's territories. The&s;e, as well as the inhabitants, are all ruined&punc; and many, who a few days ago po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable wealth, are now reduced to the utmo&s;t indigence. The neighbouring towns and vil|lages were &s;oon crouded with the people of Cu&s;trin: the roads were filled with objects of mi&s;ery: and nothing was &s;een but nakedne&s;s and de&s;pair; nothing heard but the cries of hunger, fear, and di&s;traction. For my own part, I &s;tayed all night at Goltz, and then proceeded for Berlin. Cu&s;trin is now a heap of ruins. The great magazine, the governor's hou&s;e, the church, the palace, the &s;tore and artillery hou&s;es, in a word, the old and new towns, the &s;uburbs, and all the bridges, were reduced to a&s;hes; nay, after the a&s;hes were de&s;troyed, the piles and &s;terlings were burned to the water's edge. The writings of all the colleges, together with the archives of the coun|try, were tota$ly con&s;umed, together with a prodigious magazine of corn and flour, valued at &s;ome millions of crowns. The cannon in the ar|&s;enal were all melted; and the loaded bombs and cartridges, with a large quantity of gunpowder, went off at once with a mo&s;t horrible explo&s;ion. A great number of the inhabitants are mi&s;&s;ing, &s;uppo&s;ed to have peri&s;hed in the &s;lames, or under the ruins of the hou&s;es, or to have been &s;uffocated in &s;ubterraneous vaults and caverns, to which they had &s;led for &s;afety&endq;</P>
<P>Nothing could be more inhuman, or contrary to the practice of a generous enemy, than &s;uch vengeance wreaked upon the innocent inhabitants; for the Ru&s;&s;ians did not begin to batter the fortifications until all the re&s;t of the place was de&s;troyed. In the cour&s;e of this campaign, the Ru&s;&s;ian co&s;&s;acks are &s;aid to have plundered and burned fourteen large towns and two hundred villages&punc; and wantonly butchered above two thou&s;and defencele&s;s women and children. Such mon&s;ters of barbarity ought to be excluded from all the privileges of human nature, and hunted down as wild bea&s;ts, without pity or ce&s;&s;ation. What in&s;amy ought tho&s;e powers to incur, who employ and encourage &s;uch ruthle&s;s burbarians!</P></NOTE>. The Pru&s;&s;ian army
<PB N="333" REF="337">
pa&s;&s;ed the night under arms, and next morning the cannon|ade
was renewed again&s;t the enemy, who, neverthele&s;s,
maintained that po&s;ition, without flinching. On the
<PB N="334" REF="338">
twenty-&s;eventh, they &s;eemed determined to hazard another
action, and even attack the conquerors; in&s;tead of ad|vancing,
however, they took the route of Land&s;berg;
<PB N="335" REF="339">
but afterwards turned off towards Vietzel, and po&s;ted
them&s;elves between the river Warta and that village.
Immediately after the battle, General Fermer<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">General Fermer was of Scotti&s;h extract, and General Browne actually a native of North-Britain.</NOTE>, who had
received a &s;light wound in the action, &s;ent a trumpet, with
a letter to Lieutenant-General Dohna, de&s;iring a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion
of arms for two or three days to bury the dead,
and take care of the wounded; and pre&s;enting to his
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty the humble reque&s;t of General Browne,
who was much weakened by the lo&s;s of blood, that he
might have a pa&s;&s;port, by virtue of which he could be re|moved
to a place where he &s;hould find &s;uch accommoda|tion
as his &s;ituation required. In an&s;wer to this me&s;&s;age,
Count Dohna gave the Ru&s;&s;ian general to under&s;tand,
that as his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty remained ma&s;ter of the field,
he would give the nece&s;&s;ary orders for interring the dead,
and taking care of the wounded on both &s;ides: he refu&s;ed
a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms, but granted the reque&s;t of General
Browne; and concluded his letter, by complaining of the
outrages which the Ru&s;&s;ian troops &s;till continued to com|mit,
in pillaging and burning the King's villages.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia had no &s;ooner re|pul&s;ed
the enemy in one quarter than his pre&s;ence was re|quired
in another. When he quitted Bohemia, Mare&s;chal
Daun, at the head of the Au&s;trian army, and the Prince
de Deuxponts, who commanded the forces of the empire,
advanced to the Elbe, in order to &s;urround the King's
brother Prince Henry, who, without immediate &s;uccour,
would not have been able to pre&s;erve his footing in Saxony.
The Pru&s;&s;ian monarch, therefore, determined to &s;upport
him with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. In a few days after the
battle, he began his march from Cu&s;trin with a re-enforce|ment
of twenty-four battalions and great part of his ca|valry,
and pur&s;ued his route with &s;uch unwearied diligence,
that by the fifth day of September he reached Torgau, and
<PB N="336" REF="340">
on the eleventh joined his brother. Mare&s;chal Daun had
po&s;ted him&s;elf at Stolpen, to the ea&s;tward of the Elbe, in
order to pre&s;erve an ea&s;y communication with the army of
the empire encamped in the neighbourhood of Koning|&s;tein,
to favour the operations of General Laudohn, who
had advanced through the Lower Lu&s;atia to the frontiers
of Brandenburgh; to make a diver&s;ion from the &s;outhern
parts of Sile&s;ia, where a body of Au&s;trian troops acted un|der
the command of the Generals Haarache and De Ville;
and to interrupt the communication between Prince Hen|ry
and the capital of Saxony. On the fifth day of Septem|ber,
the garri&s;on in the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Koning&s;tein &s;ur|rendered
them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, after a very feeble
re&s;i&s;tance, to the Prince de Deuxponts, who forthwith
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong camp at Pirna. When the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia, therefore, arrived at Dre&s;den, he found
the army of the empire in this po&s;ition, and Mare&s;chal Daun
in a &s;till &s;tronger &s;ituation at Stolpen, with bridges of
communication thrown over the Elbe, &s;o that he could not
attack them with any pro&s;pect of advantage. He had no
other re&s;olution to take but that of endeavouring to cut
them off from &s;upplies of provi&s;ion, and with this view he
marched to Bautzen, which he occupied. This motion
obliged the Au&s;trian general to quit his camp at Stolpen,
but he cho&s;e another of equal &s;trength at Libau, yet he
afterwards advanced to Rittlitz, that he might be at hand
to &s;ei&s;e the fir&s;t favourable occa&s;ion of executing the re|&s;olution
he had formed to attack the Pru&s;&s;ians. The King
having detached General Ratzow on his left, to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Wei&s;&s;enberg, marched forwards with the body
of his army, and po&s;ted him&s;elf in the neighbourhood of
Hochkirchen, after having di&s;lodged the Au&s;trians from
that village. Matters were now brought to &s;uch a delicate
cri&s;is, that a battle &s;eemed inevitable, and equally de&s;ired
by both parties, as an event that would determine whether
the Au&s;trians &s;hould be obliged to retreat for winter-quarters
into Bohemia, or be enabled to maintain their
ground in Saxony. In this &s;ituation Mare&s;chal Daun
<PB N="337" REF="341">
re&s;olved to act offen&s;ively, and formed a &s;cheme for attack|ing
the right flank of the Pru&s;&s;ians by &s;urpri&s;e. This
mea&s;ure was &s;ugge&s;ted to him by an over&s;ight of the
Pru&s;&s;ians, who had neglected to occupy the heights that
commanded the village of Hochkirchen, which was only
guarded by a few free companies. He determined to take
the advantage of a very dark night, and to employ the
flower of his whole army on this important &s;ervice, well
knowing, that &s;hould they penetrate through the flank of
the enemy, the whole Pru&s;&s;ian army would be di&s;con|certed,
and in all probability entirely ruined. Having
taken his mea&s;ures with wonderful &s;ecre&s;y and circum|&s;pection,
the troops began to move in the night between
the thirteenth and fourteenth of October, favoured by a
thick fog, which greatly increa&s;ed the darkne&s;s of the
night. Their fir&s;t care was to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hill
that commanded Hochkirchen, from whence they poured
down upon the village, of which they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
after having cut in pieces the free companies po&s;ted there.
The action began in this quarter about four in the morn|ing,
and continued &s;everal hours with great fury, for, not|with&s;tanding
the impetuous efforts of the Au&s;trian troops,
and the confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned among the Pru&s;&s;ians by the
&s;urpri&s;e, a vigorous &s;tand was made by &s;ome general offi|cers,
who, with admirable expedition and pre&s;ence of
mind, a&s;&s;embled and arranged the troops as they could
take to their arms, and led them up to the attack without
di&s;tinction of regiment, place, or precedence. While the
action was ob&s;tinately and de&s;perately maintained in this
place, amid&s;t all the horrours of darkne&s;s, carnage, and
confu&s;ion, the King being alarmed, exerted all his per|&s;onal
activity, addre&s;s, and recollection, in drawing re|gularity
from di&s;order, arranging the different corps,
altering po&s;itions, re-enforcing weak po&s;ts, encouraging
the &s;oldiery, and oppo&s;ing the efforts of the enemy; for
although they made their chief impre&s;&s;ion upon the right,
by the village of Hochkirchen, Mare&s;chal Daun, in order
to divide the attention of the King, made another attack
<PB N="338" REF="342">
upon the left, which was with difficulty &s;u&s;tained, $word$
effectually prevented him from &s;ending re-enforcements
to the right, where Mare&s;chal Keith, under the greate&s;t
di&s;advantages, bore the brunt of the enemy's chief endea|vours.
Thus the battle raged till nine in the morning,
when this gallant officer was &s;hot through the heart.
Prince Francis of Brun&s;wick had met with the &s;ame fate;
Prince Maurice of Anhalt was wounded and taken pri|&s;oner,
and many others were either &s;lain or di&s;abled.
As the right wing had been &s;urpri&s;ed, the tents continued
&s;tanding, and greatly embarra&s;&s;ed them in their defence.
The &s;oldiers had never been properly drawn up in order;
the enemy &s;till per&s;evered in their attack with &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
re-enforcements and redoubled re&s;olution; and a con&s;i|derable
&s;laughter was made by their artillery, which they
had brought up to the heights of Hochkirchen. All the&s;e
circum&s;tances concurring, could not fail to increa&s;e the
confu&s;ion and di&s;a&s;ter of the Pru&s;&s;ians; &s;o that about ten
the King was obliged to retire to Dobre&s;chutz, with the
lo&s;s of &s;even thou&s;and men, of all his tents, and part of
his baggage. Nor had the Au&s;trian general much cau&s;e
to boa&s;t of his victory. His lo&s;s of men was pretty near
equal to that of the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch; and, whatever
reputation he might have acquired in foiling that enter|pri&s;ing
prince, certainly his de&s;ign did not take effect in
its full extent, for the Pru&s;&s;ians were next day in a condi|tion
to hazard another engagement. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia
had &s;u&s;tained no damage which he could not ea&s;ily repair,
except the death of Mare&s;chal Keith, which was doubt|le&s;s
an irreparable misfortune<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">As very little notice was taken, in the detail publi&s;hed by authority of any part which thi$ great man acted in the battle of Hochkirchen, and report was indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated in this kingdom, that he was &s;urpri&s;ed in his tent, naked, and half a&s;leep, we think it the duty of a candid hi&s;torian $word$ vindicate his memory and reputation from the foul a&s;per&s;ion thrown by th$ per&s;idious and illiberal hand of enviou$ malice, or el&s;e contrived to &s;creen &s;om$ other character from the imputation of mi&s;conduct. This ta&s;k we are enable$ to perform by a gentleman of candour and undoubted credit, who learned th$ following particulars at Berlin from a per&s;on that was eye-witne&s;s of the whole tran&s;action. Field-Mare&s;chal Keith, who arrived in the camp the very day that preceded the battle, di&s;approved of the &s;ituation of the Pru&s;&s;ian army, and remon&s;trated to the King on that &s;ubject. In con&s;equence of his advice, a certain general was &s;ent with a detachment to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights that commanded the village of Hochkirchen; but by &s;ome fatality he mi&s;|carried. Mare&s;chal Keith was not in any tent, but lodged with Prince Fran|cis of Brun&s;wick, in a hou&s;e belonging to a Saxon major. When the fir&s;t alarm was given in the night, he in&s;tantly mounted his hor&s;e, a&s;&s;embled a body of the neare&s;t troops, and marched directly to the place that was attacked. The Au&s;trians had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hill which the Pru&s;&s;ian officer was &s;ent to occupy, and this they fortified with cannon: then they made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of the village in which the free companies of Anginelli had been po&s;ted. Mare&s;chal Keith immediately conceived the de&s;ign of the Au|&s;trian general, and knowing the importance of this place, thither directed all his efforts. He in per&s;on led on the troops to the attack of the village, from whence he drove the enemy; but being overpowered by numbers continually pouring down from the hills, he was obliged to retire in his turn. He rallied his men, returned to the charge, and regained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place: being again repul&s;ed by fre&s;h re-enforcements of the enemy, he made another effort, entered the village a third time, and finding it untenable, ordered it to be &s;et on fire. Thus he kept the Au&s;trians at bay, and maintained a de&s;perate con|flict again&s;t the flower of the Au&s;trian army, from four in the morning till nine, when the Pru&s;&s;ians were formed, and began to file off in their retreat During the whole di&s;pute he rallied the troops in per&s;on, charged at their head, and expo&s;ed his life in the hotte&s;t of a dreadful fire, like a private captain of grena|diers. He found it nece&s;&s;ary to exert him&s;elf in this manner, the better to remove the bad effects of the confu&s;ion that prevailed, and in order to in&s;pirit the troops to their utmo&s;t exertion by his voice, pre&s;ence, and example. Even when dangerou&s;ly wounded, at eight in the morning, he refu&s;ed to quit the field; but continued to &s;ignali&s;e him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of the carnage until nine, when he received a &s;econd &s;hot in his brea&s;t, and fell &s;peechle&s;s into the arms of Mr. T$bay, an Engli&s;h volunteer, who had attended him during the whole campaign. This gentleman, who was likewi&s;e wounded, applied to a Pru&s;&s;ian officer for a file of men to remove the mare&s;chal, being uncertain whether he was entirely deprived of life. His reque&s;t was granted; but the &s;oldiers, in advancing to the &s;pot, were countermanded by another officer. He afterwards &s;poke on the &s;ame &s;ubject to one of the Pru&s;&s;ian generals, a German prince, as he chanced to pa&s;s on hor&s;e-back: when Mr. Tibay told him the field-mare&s;chal was lying wounded on the field, he a&s;ked if his wounds were mortal; and the other an&s;wering he was afraid they were, the prince &s;hrugged up his &s;houl|ders, and rode off without further que&s;tion. The body of this great officer, being thus &s;hamefully abandoned, was &s;oon &s;tripped by the Au&s;trian &s;tragglers, and lay expo&s;ed and undi&s;tingui&s;hed on the field of battle. In this &s;ituation it was perceived by Count La&s;ci, &s;on of the general of that name, with whom Ma$e&s;chal Keith had &s;erved in Ru&s;&s;ia. This young count had been the mare&s;chal's pupil, and revered him as his military father, though employed in the Au&s;trian &s;ervice. He recogni&s;ed the body by the large &s;car of a dangerous wound, which General Keith had received in his thigh at the &s;iege of Ockza|cow, and could not help bur&s;ting into tears to &s;ee his honoured ma&s;ter$hus ex|tended at his feet, a naked, lifele&s;s, and de&s;erted corp&s;e. He forhwith cau&s;ed the body to be covered, and interred. It was afterwards taken up, and de|cently buried by the curate of Hochkirchen; and, finally emoved to Be$lin by order of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who be&s;towed upon it cho&s;e funeral honours that were due to the dignified rank and tran&s;cendent merit of the de|cea&s;ed; merit &s;o univer&s;ally acknowledged, that even the Saxons lamented him as their be&s;t friend and patron, who protected them from violence and outrage, even while he acted a principal part in &s;ubjecting them to the domi|nion of his &s;overeign.</NOTE>.</P>

&sect; XXXVII. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty remained with his
army ten days at Dobre&s;chutz, during which he endea|voured
to bring the Au&s;trians to a &s;econd engagement, but
<PB N="340" REF="344">
Count Daun declined the invitation, and kept his forces
advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted on eminences planted with artillery.
His aim having been fru&s;trated at Hochkirchen, where
he fought with many advantages on his &s;ide, he would
not hazard another battle upon equal terms, with &s;uch an
enterpri&s;ing enemy, rendered more vigilant by the check
he had received, already re-enforced from the army of
Prince Henry, and eager for an opportunity to retrieve
the laurel which had been &s;natched from him by the
wiles of &s;tratagem, rather than by the hand of valour.
Count Daun having nothing more to hope from the active
operations of his own army, contented him&s;elf with
amu&s;ing the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch in Lu&s;atia, while the Au|&s;trian
generals, Har&s;che and De Ville, &s;hould pro&s;ecute
the reduction of Nei&s;s and Co&s;el, in Sile&s;ia, which they
now actually inve&s;ted. As the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch could
not &s;pare detachments to oppo&s;e every different corps of
his enemies that acted again&s;t him in different parts of his
dominions, he re&s;olved to make up in activity what he
wanted in number, and if po&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e the &s;iege of
Nei&s;s in per&s;on. With this view he decamped from Dob|re&s;chutz,
and in &s;ight of the enemy marched to Gorlitz
without the lea&s;t interruption. From thence he proceeded
towards Sile&s;ia with his u&s;ual expedition, notwith&s;tanding
all the endeavours and activity of General Laudohn, who
<PB N="341" REF="345">
harra&s;&s;ed the rear of the Pru&s;&s;ians, and gained &s;ome petty
advantages over them. Count Daun not only &s;ent this
detached corps to retard them in their march, but at the
&s;ame time, by another route, detached a &s;trong re-enforce|ment
to the army of the be&s;iegers. In the mean time,
having received intelligence that the army of Prince Henry
in Saxony was con&s;iderably weakened, he him&s;elf marched
thither, in hopes of expelling the Prince from that country,
and reducing the capital in the King's ab&s;ence. Indeed,
his de&s;igns were &s;till more exten&s;ive, for he propo&s;ed to
reduce Dre&s;den, Leip&s;ick, and Torgau at the &s;ame time;
the fir&s;t with the main body under his own direction, the
&s;econd by the army of the Empire under the Prince de
Deuxponts, and the third by a corps under General Had|dick,
while the forces directed by Laudohn &s;hould ex|clude
the King from Lu&s;atia. In execution of this plan
he marched directly to the Elbe, which he pa&s;&s;ed at Pirna,
and advanced to Dre&s;den, which he hoped would &s;ur|render
without putting him to the trouble of a formal
&s;iege. The army of Prince Henry had already retired to
the we&s;tward of this capital, before the Prince de Deux|ponts,
who had found means to cut off his communication
with Leip&s;ick, and even inve&s;ted that city. During the&s;e
tran&s;actions, General Haddick advanced again&s;t Torgau.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The Field-Mare&s;chal Count Daun ap|pearing
on the &s;ixth day of November within &s;ight of
Dre&s;den, at the head of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, encamped
next day at Lockowitz, and on the eighth his advanced
troops attacked the Pru&s;&s;ian hu&s;&s;ars and independent bat|talions,
which were po&s;ted at Strie&s;&s;en and Gruenewie&s;e.
Count Schmettau, who commanded the garri&s;on, amount|ing
to ten thou&s;and men, apprehen&s;ive that, in the cour&s;e
of &s;kirmi&s;hing, the Au&s;trian troops might enter the &s;u|burbs
pellmell, po&s;ted Colonel Itzenplitz, with &s;even hun|dred
men, in the redoubts that &s;urrounded the &s;uburbs,
that in ca&s;e of emergency they might &s;upport the irregu|lars:
at the &s;ame time, as the hou&s;es that con&s;tituted the
&s;uburbs were generally &s;o high as to overlook the ramparts,
<PB N="342" REF="346">
and command the city, he prepared combu&s;tibles and
gave notice to the magi&s;trates that they would be &s;et on
fire as &s;oon as an Au&s;trian &s;hould appear within the place.
This mu&s;t have been a dreadful declaration to the inha|bitants
of the&s;e &s;uburbs, which compo&s;e one of the mo&s;t
elegant towns in Europe. In the&s;e hou&s;es, which were
generally lofty and magnificent, the fa&s;hionable and
wealthy cla&s;s of people re&s;ided, and here a number of ar|ti&s;ts
carried on a variety of curious manufactures. In
vain the magi&s;trates implored the mercy and forbearance
of the Pru&s;&s;ian governour, and repre&s;ented, in the mo&s;t
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;train, that as they were unconcerned in the
war, they hoped they &s;hould be exempted from the hor|rours
of deva&s;tation. In vain the royal family, who re|mained
at Dre&s;den, conjured him to &s;pare that la&s;t refuge
of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed royalty, and allow them at lea&s;t a &s;ecure re|&s;idence,
&s;ince they were deprived of every other comfort.
He continued inflexible, or rather determined to execute
the orders of his ma&s;ter, which indeed he could not
di&s;obey with any regard to his own &s;afety. On the ninth
day of November, about noon, the Au&s;trian vanguard
attacked the advanced po&s;t of the garri&s;on, repelled the
hu&s;&s;ars, drove the independent battalions into the &s;uburbs,
and forced three of the redoubts, while their cannon
played upon the town. The governour, expecting a vi|gorous
attack next day, recalled his troops within the city,
after they had &s;et fire to the &s;uburbs. At three in the
morning the &s;ignal was made for this terrible conflagra|tion,
which in a little time reduced to a&s;hes the beautiful
&s;uburbs of Pirna, which had &s;o lately flouri&s;hed as the &s;eat
of gaiety, plea&s;ure, and the ingenious arts. Every bo&s;om
warmed with benevolence mu&s;t be affected at the recital of
&s;uch calamities. It excites not only our compa&s;&s;ion for
the unhappy &s;ufferers, but al&s;o our re&s;entment again&s;t the
perpetrators of &s;uch enormity. Next day Mare&s;chal Daun
&s;ent an officer to Count Schmettau, with a me&s;&s;age, ex|pre&s;&s;ing
his &s;urprize at the de&s;truction of the &s;uburbs in a
royal re&s;idence, an act of inhumanity unheard of among
<PB N="343" REF="347">
chri&s;tians. He de&s;ired to know if it was by the gover|nour's
order this mea&s;ure was taken, and a&s;&s;ured him,
that he &s;hould be re&s;pon&s;ible, in his per&s;on, for whatever
outrages had been or might be committed again&s;t a place
in which a royal family re&s;ided. Schmettau gave him to
under&s;tand that he had orders to defend the town to the
la&s;t extremity, and that the pre&s;ervation of what remained
depended entirely on the conduct of his excellency; for,
&s;hould he think proper to attack the place, he (the gover|nour)
would defend him&s;elf from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and from
&s;treet to &s;treet, and even make his la&s;t effort in the royal
palace, rather than abandon the city. He excu&s;ed the
de&s;truction of the &s;uburbs as a nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure, autho|ri&s;ed
by the practice of war; but he would have found it
a difficult ta&s;k to reconcile this &s;tep to the laws of eternal
ju&s;tice, and far le&s;s to the dictates of common humanity.
Indeed, if the &s;cene had happened in an enemy's country,
or if no other &s;tep could have &s;aved the lives and liberties of
him&s;elf and his garri&s;on, &s;uch a de&s;perate remedy might
have &s;tood excu&s;ed by the law of nature and of nations:
but on this occa&s;ion he occupied a neutral city, over
which he could exerci&s;e no other power and authority
but that which he derived from illegal force and violence;
nor was he at all reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;acrificing the
place to his own &s;afety, ina&s;much as he might have re|tired
unmole&s;ted, by virtue of an honourable capitulation,
which however he did not demand. Whether the pe|remptory
order of a &s;uperior will, <HI>in &s;oro con&s;cientiae,</HI> ju&s;tify
an officer who hath committed an illegal or inhuman
action, is a que&s;tion that an Engli&s;h reader will &s;carce
leave to the determination of a German ca&s;ui&s;t with one
hundred and fifty thou&s;and armed men in his retinue. Be
this as it will, Mr. Ponickau, the Saxon mini&s;ter, imme|diately
after this tragedy was acted, without waiting for
his ma&s;ter's orders, pre&s;ented a memorial to the Diet of
the Empire, complaining of it as an action re&s;erved for the
hi&s;tory of the war which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had kindled
in Germany, to be tran&s;mitted to fugure ages. He af|firmed,
<PB N="344" REF="348">
that, in execution of Schmettau's orders the &s;oldiers
had di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves in the &s;treets of the Pirna and
Witchen &s;uburbs, broke open the hou&s;es and &s;hops, &s;et
fire to the combu&s;tibles, added fre&s;h fuel, and then &s;hut
the doors; that the violence of the flames was kept up by
red-hot balls fired into the hou&s;es, and along the &s;treets;
that the wretched inhabitants, who for&s;ook their burning
hou&s;es, were &s;lain by the fire of the cannon and &s;mall arms;
that tho&s;e who endeavoured to &s;ave their per&s;ons and effects
were pu&s;hed down and de&s;troyed by the bayonets of the Pru&s;|&s;ian
&s;oldiers, po&s;ted in the &s;treets for that purpo&s;e: he enu|merated
particular in&s;tances of inhuman barbarity, and de|clared
that a great number of people peri&s;hed, either
amid&s;t the flames, or under the ruins of the hou&s;es. The
de&s;truction of two hundred and fifty elegant hou&s;es, and
the total ruin of the inhabitants, were circum&s;tances in
them&s;elves &s;o deplorable, as to need no aggravation: but
the account of the Saxon mini&s;ter was &s;hamefully exagge|rated,
and all the particular in&s;tances of cruelty fal&s;e in
every circum&s;tance. Baron Plotho, the mini&s;ter of Bran|denburgh,
did not fail to an&s;wer every article of the Saxon
memorial, and refute the particulars therein alledged, in a
fair detail, authenticated by certificates under the hands
of the magi&s;trates, judges, and principal inhabitants of
Dre&s;den. The mo&s;t extraordinary part of this defence or
vindication was the conclu&s;ion, in which the Baron &s;o|lemnly
a&s;&s;ured the Diet, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, from
his great love to mankind, always felt the greate&s;t emotion
of &s;oul, and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite concern, at the effu&s;ion of
blood, the deva&s;tation of cities and countries, and the hor|rours
of war, by which &s;o many thou&s;and fellow creatures
were overwhelmed; and that if his &s;incere and hone&s;t
inclination to procure peace to Germany, his dear coun|try,
had met with the lea&s;t regard, the pre&s;ent war, at|tended
with &s;uch blood&s;hed and de&s;olation, would have
been prevented and avoided. He, therefore, declared $word$
tho&s;e who excited the pre&s;ent troubles, who, in&s;tead o$
extingui&s;hing, threw oil upon the flames, mu&s;t an|&s;wer
<PB N="345" REF="349">
to God for the &s;eas of blood that had been, and would
be &s;hed, for the deva&s;tation of &s;o many countries, and the
entire ruin of &s;o many innocent individuals. Such de|clarations
co&s;t nothing to tho&s;e hardened politicians, who,
feeling no internal check, are determined to &s;acrifice every
con&s;ideration to the motives of rapacity and ambition. It
would be happy, however, for mankind, were princes
taught to believe that there is really an omnipotent and
all-judging power, that will exact a &s;evere account of
their conduct, and puni&s;h them for their guilt, without any
re&s;pect to their per&s;ons; that pillaging a whole people is
more cruel than robbing a &s;ingle per&s;on; and that the
ma&s;&s;acre of thou&s;ands is, at lea&s;t, as criminal as private
murther.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. While Count Daun was employed in making
a fruitle&s;s attempt upon the capital of Saxony, the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia proceeded in his march to Nei&s;s, which was com|pletely
inve&s;ted on the third day of October. The opera|tions
of the &s;iege were carried on with great vigour by the
Au&s;trian general, De Har&s;che, and the place was as vi|gorou&s;ly
defended by the Pru&s;&s;ian governour, The&s;kau,
till the fir&s;t day of November, when the Pru&s;&s;ian mo|narch
approached, and obliged the be&s;iegers to abandon
their enterpri&s;e. M. de Har&s;che having rai&s;ed the &s;iege,
the King detached General Fouquet with a body of troops
acro&s;s the river Nei&s;s, and immediately the blockade of
Co&s;el was likewi&s;e abandoned. De Har&s;che retired to Bo|hemia,
and De Vill hovered about Jagern&s;dorf. The
fortre&s;s of Nei&s;s was no &s;ooner relieved than the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia began his march on his return to Saxony, where
his immediate pre&s;ence was required. At the &s;ame time,
the two bodies under the Generals Dohna and Wedel
penetrated by different routes into that country. The
former had been left at Cu&s;trin, to watch the motions of
the Ru&s;&s;ians, who had by this time retreated to the Vi&s;tula,
and even cro&s;&s;ed that river at Thorn, and the other had,
during the campaign, ob&s;erved the Swedes, who had now
entirely evacuated the Pru&s;&s;ian territories, &s;o that Wedel
<PB N="346" REF="350">
was at liberty to co-operate with the King in Saxony.
He accordingly marched to Torgau, the &s;iege of which
had been undertaken by the Au&s;trian general, Haddick,
who was repul&s;ed by Wedel, and even pur&s;ued to the
neighbourhood of Eulenbourg. Wedel, being afterwards
joined by Dohna, drove him from thence with con&s;iderable
lo&s;s, and then rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Leip&s;ick. Mean while,
the King pro&s;ecuted his march towards the capital
of Saxony, driving before him the body of Au&s;trian
troops, under Laudohn, who retreated to Zittau. On the
tenth day of November Count Daun retired from Dre&s;den,
and with the army of the Empire fell back towards Bo|hemia;
and on the twentieth the King arrived in that
city, where he approved of the governour's conduct. The
Ru&s;&s;ian general fore&s;eeing that he &s;hould not be able to
maintain his ground during the winter in Pomerania, un|le&s;s
he could &s;ecure &s;ome &s;ea-port on the Baltick, by which
he might be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, detached General
Palmbach, with fifteen thou&s;and men, to be&s;iege the town
of Colberg, an incon&s;iderable place, very meanly fortified.
It was accordingly inve&s;ted on the third day of October;
but the be&s;iegers were either &s;o ill provided with proper
implements, or &s;o little acquainted with operations of
this nature, that the garri&s;on, though feeble, maintained
the place again&s;t all their attacks for &s;ix-and-twenty days;
at the expiration of which they abandoned their enter|pri&s;e,
and cruelly ravaged the open country in their re|treat.
Thus, by the activity and valour of the Pru&s;&s;ian
monarch, his generals, and officers, &s;ix &s;ieges were rai&s;ed
almo&s;t at the &s;ame period, namely, tho&s;e of Colberg,
Nei&s;s, Co&s;el, Torgau, Leip&s;ick, and Dre&s;den.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. The variety of fortune which the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia experienced in the cour&s;e of this campaign was very
remarkable; but the &s;pirit of his conduct, and the ra|pidity
of his motions, were altogether without example.
In the former campaign we were dazzled with the lu&s;tre of
his victories; in this we admire his fortitude and &s;kill in
&s;temming the different torrents of adver&s;ity, and ri&s;ing
<PB N="347" REF="351">
&s;uperior to his evil fotune. One can hardly without
a&s;toni&s;hment recollect, that in the cour&s;e of a few months
he invaded Moravia, inve&s;ted Olmutz, and was obliged to
relinqui&s;h that de&s;ign; that he marched through an ene|my's
country, in the face of a great army, which, though
it harra&s;&s;ed him in his retreat, could not, in a route of an
hundred miles, obtain any advantage over him; that, in
&s;pite of his di&s;a&s;ter at Olmutz, and the difficulties of &s;uch
a march, he penetrated into Bohemia, drove the enemy
from Koning&s;gratz, executed another dangerous and fa|tiguing
march to the Oder, defeated a great army of Ru&s;|&s;ians,
and returned by the way of Saxony, from whence he
drove the Au&s;trian and Imperial armies; that after his de|feat
at Hochkirchen, where he lo&s;t two of his be&s;t generals,
and was obliged to leave his tents &s;tanding, he baffled the
vigilance and &s;uperior number of the victorious army,
ru&s;hed like a whirlwind to the relief of Sile&s;ia, invaded by
an Au&s;trian army, which he compelled to retire with pre|cipitation
from that province; that, with the &s;ame rapidity
of motion, he wheeled about to Saxony, and once more
re&s;cued it from the hands of his adver&s;aries; that in one
campaign he made twice the circuit of his dominions, re|lieved
them all in their turns, and kept all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
entire again&s;t the united efforts of numerous armies, con|ducted
by generals of con&s;ummate &s;kill and undaunted
re&s;olution. His character would have been &s;till more
complete, if his moderation had been equal to his courage,
but in this particular we cannot applaud his conduct. In|cen&s;ed
by the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit of his enemies, he wreaked
his vengeance on tho&s;e who had done him no injury; and
the cruelties which the Ru&s;&s;ians had committed in his
dominions were retaliated upon the unfortunate inha|bitants
of Saxony. In the latter end of September, the
pre&s;ident of the Pru&s;&s;ian military directory &s;ent a letter to
the magi&s;trates of Leip&s;ick, requiring them in the King's
name to pay a new contribution of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and
crowns, and to begin immediately with the payment of
one-third part, on pain of military execution. In an&s;wer
<PB N="348" REF="352">
to this demand the magi&s;trates repre&s;ented that the city
having been exhau&s;ted by the enormous contributions
already rai&s;ed, and ab&s;olutely incapable of furni&s;hing fur|ther
&s;upplies; that the trade was &s;tagnated and ruined,
and the inhabitants &s;o impoveri&s;hed, that they could no
longer pay the ordinary taxes. This remon&s;trance made
no impre&s;&s;ion. At five in the morning the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;ol|diers
a&s;&s;embled, and were po&s;ted in all the &s;treets, &s;quares,
market-places, caemeteries, towers, and &s;teeples; then the
gates being &s;hut, in order to exclude the populace of the
&s;uburbs from the city, the &s;enators were brought into the
town-hall, and acco&s;ted by General Hau&s;s, who told them
the king his ma&s;ter would have money; and if they re|fu&s;ed
to part with it the city &s;hould be plundered. To
this peremptory addre&s;s they replied to this effect: &startq;We
have no more money&mdash;we have nothing left but life; and
we recommend our&s;elves to the King's mercy.&endq; In
con&s;equence of this declaration, di&s;po&s;itions were made for
giving up the city to be plundered. Cannon were planted
in all the &s;treets, the inhabitants were ordered to remain
within doors, and every hou&s;e re&s;ounded with di&s;mal cries
and lamentations. The dreaded pillage, however, was
converted into a regular exaction. A party of &s;oldiers,
commanded by a &s;ubaltern, went from hou&s;e to hou&s;e,
&s;ignifying to every burgher that he &s;hould produce all his
&s;pecie, on pain of immediate pillage and ma&s;&s;acre; and
every inhabitant delivered up his all without further he&s;i|tation.
About &s;ix in the evening, the &s;oldiers returned to
their quarters; but the magi&s;trates were detained in con|finement,
and all the citizens were overwhelmed with grief
and con&s;ternation. Happy Britain, who knowe&s;t &s;uch
grievances only by report! When the King of Pru&s;&s;ia
fir&s;t entered Saxony, at the beginning of the war, he de|clared
the had no de&s;ign to make a conque&s;t of that electo|rate,
but only to keep it as a depo&s;itum for the &s;ecurity of
his own dominions, until he could oblige his enemies to
acquie&s;ce in rea&s;onable terms of peace; but upon his la&s;t
arrival at Dre&s;den he adopted a new re&s;olution. In the
<PB N="349" REF="353">
beginning of December the Pru&s;&s;ian directory of war
i&s;&s;ued a decree to the deputies of the &s;tates of the electorate,
demanding a certain quantity of flour and forage, accord|ing
to the convention formerly &s;ettled; at the &s;ame time
&s;ignifying, that though the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had hitherto
treated the electorate as a country taken under his &s;pecial
protection, the face of affairs was now changed in &s;uch a
manner, that for the future he would con&s;ider it in no
other light than that of a conquered country. The
Ru&s;&s;ians had &s;ei&s;ed in Pru&s;&s;ia all the e&s;tates and effects
belonging to the King's officers: a retaliation was now
made upon the effects of the Saxon officers who &s;erved in
the Ru&s;&s;ian army. Seals were put on all the cabinets con|taining
papers belonging to the privy-coun&s;ellors of his
Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty, and they them&s;elves ordered to depart for
War&s;aw at a very &s;hort warning. Though the city had
been impoveri&s;hed by former exactions, and very lately
&s;ubjected to military execution, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia de|manded
fre&s;h contributions, and even extorted them by
dint of &s;everities that &s;hock humanity. He &s;urrounded
the exchange with &s;oldiers, and confining the merchants
to &s;traw-beds and naked apartments, obliged them to
draw bills for very large &s;ums on their foreign corre|&s;pondents:
a method of proceeding much more &s;uitable
to the de&s;poti&s;m of a Per&s;ian &s;ophi towards a conquered
people who profe&s;&s;ed a different faith, than reconcileable
to the character of a prote&s;tant prince towards a peaceable
nation of brethren, with whom he was connected by the
common ties of neighbourhood and religion. Even if they
had acted as declared enemies, and been &s;ubdued with
arms in their hands, the exce&s;&s;es of war on the &s;ide of the
conqueror ought to have cea&s;ed with the ho&s;tilities of the
conqueror, who, by &s;ubmitting to his &s;way, would have
become his &s;ubjects, and in that capacity had a claim to
his protection. To retaliate upon the Saxons, who had
e&s;pou&s;ed no quarrel, the barbarities committed by the
Ru&s;&s;ians, with whom he was actually at war, and to treat
as a conquered province a neutral country, which his ene|mies
<PB N="350" REF="354">
had entered by violence, and been obliged to evacuate
by force of arms, was a &s;pecies of conduct founded on pre|tences
which overturn all right, and confound all rea&s;on.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. Having recorded all the tran&s;actions of the
campaign, except tho&s;e in which the Swedes were con|cerned,
it now remains that we &s;hould particulari&s;e the
progre&s;s which was made in Pomerania by the troops of
that nation, under the command of Count Hamilton. We
have already ob&s;erved, that in the beginning of the year the
Pru&s;&s;ian general, Lehwald, had compelled them to evacu|ate
the whole province, except Stral&s;und, which was like|wi&s;e
inve&s;ted. This, in all probability, would have been
be&s;ieged in form, had not Lehwald re&s;igned the command
of the Pru&s;&s;ians, on account of his great age and infirmi|ties,
and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Count Dohna been obliged to with|draw
his troops, in order to oppo&s;e the Ru&s;&s;ian army on
the other &s;ide of Pomerania. The blockade of Stral&s;und
being con&s;equently rai&s;ed, and that part of the country
entirely evacuated by the Pru&s;&s;ians, the Swedi&s;h troops
advanced again from the i&s;le of Rugen, to which they had
retired: but the &s;upplies and re-enforcements they ex|pected
from Stockholm were delayed in &s;uch a manner,
either from a deficiency in the &s;ub&s;idies promi&s;ed by France,
or from the management of tho&s;e who were aver&s;e to the
war, that great part of the &s;ea&s;on was elap&s;ed before they
undertook any important enterpri&s;e. Indeed, while they
lay encamped under the cannon of Stral&s;und, waiting for
the&s;e &s;upplies, their operations were retarded by the ex|plo&s;ion
of a whole &s;hip-load of gunpowder intended for
their u&s;e; an event imputed to the practices of the Pru&s;&s;ian
party in Sweden, which at this period &s;eemed to gain
ground, and even threatened a change in the mini&s;try.
At length the re-enforcement arrived about the latter end
of June, and their general &s;eemed determined to act with
vigour. In the beginning of July, his army being put in
motion, he &s;ent a detachment to di&s;lodge the few Pru&s;&s;ian
troops that were left at Anclam, Demmin, and other
places, to guard that frontier; and they retreated accord|ingly.
<PB N="351" REF="355">
Count Hamilton having nothing further to op|po&s;e
him in the field, in a very little time recovered all Swe|di&s;h
Pomerania, and even made hot incur&s;ions into the
Pru&s;&s;ian territories. Mean while, a combined fleet of thirty-three
Ru&s;&s;ian and &s;even Swedi&s;h &s;hips of war appeared in
the Baltick, and anchored between the i&s;lands of Dragoe
and Amagh; but they neither landed troops, nor com|mitted
ho&s;tilities. The Swedi&s;h general advanced as far
as Fehrbellin, &s;ent out parties that rai&s;ed contributions
within five-and-twenty miles of Berlin, and threw the in|habitants
of that capital into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation.
The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, alarmed at their progre&s;s, di&s;patched
General Wedel from Dre&s;den, with a body of troops that
were augmented on their march; &s;o that, on the twen|tieth
of September, he found him&s;elf at Berlin with eleven
thou&s;and effective men, at the head of whom he proceeded
again&s;t Count Hamilton, while the Prince of Bevern, with
five thou&s;and, advanced on the other &s;ide from Stetin. At
their approach, the Swedi&s;h commander retired, after
having left a garri&s;on of fourteen hundred men at Fehrbel|lin,
in order to retard the Pru&s;&s;ians, and &s;ecure the retreat
of his army. The place was immediately attacked by Ge|neral
Wedel; and though the Swedes di&s;puted the ground
from hou&s;e to hou&s;e with uncommon ob&s;tinacy, he at
la&s;t drove them out of the town, with the lo&s;s of one
half of their number either killed or taken pri&s;oners.
The body of the Swedi&s;h army, without hazarding any
other action, immediately evacuated the Pru&s;&s;ian terri|tories,
and returned to the neighbourhood of Stral&s;und,
intending to take winter-quarters in the i&s;le of Rugen.
Count Hamilton, either di&s;gu&s;ted at the re&s;trictions he
had been laid under, or finding him&s;elf unable to act in
&s;uch a manner as might redound to the advantage of
his reputation, threw up his command, retired from the
army, and re&s;igned all his other employments.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia was not only favoured
by a con&s;iderable party in Sweden, but he had al&s;o rai&s;ed
a &s;trong intere&s;t in Poland, among &s;uch Palatines as had
<PB N="352" REF="356">
always oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures of the reigning family
The&s;e were now re-enforced by many patriots, who
dreaded the vicinity, and &s;u&s;pected the de&s;igns of the
Ru&s;&s;ian army. The diet of the republick was opened on
the &s;econd day of November; and, after warm debates,
M. Malachow&s;ki was unanimou&s;ly elected mare&s;chal:
but no &s;ooner had the chamber of nuncios begun their
deliberations, than a number of voices were rai&s;ed again&s;t
the encroachments of the Ru&s;&s;ian troops, who had taken
up their re&s;idence in Poland; and heavy complaints were
made of the damages &s;u&s;tained from their cruelty and ra|pine.
Great pains were taken to appea&s;e the&s;e clamours;
and many were prevailed upon to refer the&s;e grievances to
the king in &s;enate; but when this difficulty &s;eemed almo&s;t
&s;urmounted, Padhor&s;ki, the nuncio of Volhinia, &s;tood up,
and declared that he would not permit any other point to
be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the diet while the Ru&s;&s;ians maintained the
lea&s;t footing within the territories of the republick. Vain
were all the attempts of the courtiers to per&s;uade and
mollify this inflexible patriot, he &s;olemnly prote&s;ted again&s;t
their proceedings, and ha&s;tily withdrew; &s;o that the Ma|re&s;chal
was obliged to di&s;&s;olve the a&s;&s;embly, and recour&s;e
was had to a <HI>&s;enatus con&s;ilium,</HI> to concert proper mea&s;ures to
be taken in the pre&s;ent conjuncture. The King of Poland
was, on this occa&s;ion, likewi&s;e di&s;appointed in his views
of providing for his &s;on, Prince Charles, in the duchy of
Courland. He had been recommended by the court of
Ru&s;&s;ia, and even approved by the &s;tates of that country;
but two difficulties occurred. The &s;tates declared they
could not proceed to a new election during the life of their
former duke, Count Biron, who was &s;till alive, though
a pri&s;oner in Siberia, unle&s;s their duchy &s;hould be de|clared
vacant by the King and republick of Poland; and,
according to the laws of that country, no prince could be
elected, until he &s;hould have declared him&s;elf of the
Aug&s;burgh confe&s;&s;ion. His Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty, however,
being determined to &s;urmount all ob&s;tacles to his &s;on's
<PB N="353" REF="357">
intere&s;t, ordered Count Malacho&s;ki, high chancellor of
Poland, to deliver to Prince Charles a diploma, by which
the King granted permi&s;&s;ion to the &s;tates of Courland to
elect that prince for their duke, and appointed the day
for his election and in&s;talment, which accordingly took
place in the month of January, notwith&s;tanding the cla|mour
of many Poli&s;h grandees, who per&s;i&s;ted in affirming
that the king had no power to grant &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion with|out
the con&s;ent of the diet. The vici&s;&s;itudes of the cam|paign
had produced no revolutions in the &s;everal &s;y&s;tems
adopted by the different powers in Europe. The Czarina,
who in the month of June had &s;ignified her &s;entiments and
de&s;igns again&s;t the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, in a declaration de|livered
to all the foreign mini&s;ters at Peter&s;burgh, &s;eemed
now, more than ever, determined to act vigorou&s;ly in be|half
of the Empre&s;s-Queen of Hungary, and the unfortu|nate
King of Poland, who &s;till re&s;ided at War&s;aw. The
court of Vienna di&s;tributed among the Imperial mini&s;ters
at the &s;everal courts of the Empire copies of a re&s;cript,
explaining the conduct of her generals &s;ince the beginning
of the campaign, and concluding with expre&s;&s;ions of &s;elf-approbation
to this effect: &startq;Though the i&s;&s;ue of the
campaign be not as yet entirely &s;atisfactory, and &s;uch as
might be de&s;ired, the Imperial court enjoys, at lea&s;t, the
&s;incere &s;atisfaction of reflecting, that, according to the
change of circum&s;tances, it in&s;tantly took the mo&s;t vigorous
re&s;olutions; that it was never deficient in any thing that
might contribute to the good of the common cau&s;e, and
is now employed in making preparations, from which the
mo&s;t happy con&s;equences may be expected.&endq;</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. We have already hinted at a decree of the
Aulick council of the Empire, publi&s;hed in the month of
Augu&s;t, enjoining all directors of circles, all Imperial
towns, and the noble&s;&s;e of the Empire, to tran&s;mit to
Vienna an exact li&s;t of all tho&s;e who had di&s;obeyed the
avocatoria of the Empire, and adhered to the rebellion
rai&s;ed by the Elector of Brandenburgh; that their reve|nues
might be &s;eque&s;tered, and them&s;elves puni&s;hed in their
<PB N="354" REF="358">
honours, per&s;ons, and effects. As the Elector of Hanover
was plainly pointed out, and, indeed, expre&s;sly mentioned
in this decree, the King of Great-Britain, by the hands
of Baron Gemmegen, his electoral mini&s;ter, pre&s;ented a
memorial to the diet of the Empire in the month of No|vember,
enumerating the in&s;tances in which he had
exerted him&s;elf, and even expo&s;ed his life, for the pre&s;er|vation
and aggrandi&s;ement of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. In
return for the&s;e important &s;ervices, he ob&s;erved that the
Empre&s;s-Queen had refu&s;ed him the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;tipulated
in treaties again&s;t an inva&s;ion planned by France, who&s;e
hatred he had drawn upon him&s;elf by his friend&s;hip to that
prince&s;s; and his Imperial Maje&s;ty even denied him the
dictatorial letters which he &s;ollicited: that the courts of
Vienna had &s;igned a treaty with the crown of France, in
which it was &s;tipulated that the French troops &s;hould
pa&s;s the We&s;er, and invade the electorate of Hanover,
where they were joined by the troops of the Empre&s;s-Queen,
who ravaged his Britannick Maje&s;ty's dominions
with greater cruelty than even the French had practi&s;ed;
and the &s;ame Duke of Cumberland, who had been wounded
at Dettingen in the defence of her Imperial Maje&s;ty,
was obliged to fight at Ha&s;tenbeck again&s;t the troops of
that very prince&s;s, in defence of his father's dominions;
that &s;he &s;ent commi&s;&s;aries to Hanover, who &s;hared with
the crown of France the contributions extorted from the
electorate; rejected all propo&s;als of peace, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
from her court the mini&s;ter of Brun&s;wick-Lunenbourg:
that his Imperial Maje&s;ty, who had &s;worn to protect the
Empire, and oppo&s;e the entrance of foreign troops de&s;tined
to oppre&s;s any of the &s;tates of Germany, afterwards re|quired
the King of England to withdraw his troops from
the countries which they occupied, that a French army
might again have free pa&s;&s;age into his German dominions:
that the Emperor had recalled the&s;e troops, relea&s;ed them
from their allegiance to their &s;overeign, enjoined them to
abandon their po&s;ts, their colours, and the &s;ervice in
which they were embarked, on pain of being puni&s;hed in
<PB N="355" REF="359">
body, honour, and e&s;tate; and that the King of England
him&s;elf was threatened with the ban of the Empire. He
took notice, that, in quality of elector, he had been ac|cu&s;ed
of refu&s;ing to concur with the re&s;olutions of the diet
taken in the preceding year, of entering into alliance with
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, joining his troops to the armies of
that prince, employing auxiliaries belonging to the &s;tates
of the Empire, &s;ending Engli&s;h forces into Germany,
where they had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Embden, and exacting
contributions in different parts of Germany. In an&s;wer
to the&s;e imputations, he alledged that he could not, con|&s;i&s;tent
with his own &s;afety, or the dictates of common
&s;en&s;e, concur with a majority, in joining his troops,
which were immediately nece&s;&s;ary for his own defence,
to tho&s;e which, from the arbitrary views of the court of
Vienna, were led again&s;t his friend and ally, the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia, by a prince who did not belong to the generality
of the Empire, and on whom the command had been con|ferred,
without a previous conclu&s;um of the Germanick
body; that, with re&s;pect to his alliance with the King
of Pru&s;&s;ia, he had a right, when de&s;erted by his former
allies, to &s;eek a&s;&s;i&s;tance where&s;oever it could be procured:
and &s;urely no ju&s;t grounds of complaint could be offered
again&s;t that which his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty lent, to deliver
the electroal &s;tates of Brun&s;wick, as well as tho&s;e of
Brun&s;wick-Wolfenbuttel, He&s;&s;e, and Buckebourg, from
the oppre&s;&s;ions of their common enemy. Po&s;terity, he
&s;aid, would hardly believe, that at a time when the troops of
Au&s;tria, the Palatinate, and Wirtemberg, were engaged
to invade the countries of the Empire, other members of
the Germanick body, who employed auxiliaries in their
defence, &s;hould be threatened with outlawry and &s;eque&s;|tration.
He owned, that, in quality of king, he had &s;ent
over Engli&s;h troops to Germany, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Embden; &s;teps for which he was accountable to no power
upon earth, although the con&s;titution of the Empire per|mit
the co-e&s;tates to make u&s;e of foreign troops, not indeed
for the purpo&s;e of inva&s;ion or conque&s;t in Germany, but for
their defence and pre&s;ervation. He al&s;o acknowledged that
<PB N="356" REF="360">
he had re&s;ented the conduct, and cha&s;ti&s;ed the inju&s;tice, o$
tho&s;e co-e&s;tates who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted his enemies, and helped to
ravage his dominions; inferring, that if the crown of France
was free to pillage the e&s;tates of the Duke of Brun&s;wick, and
the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, becau&s;e they had &s;upplied
the King of England with auxiliaries; if the Empre&s;s-Queen
had a right to appropriate to her&s;elf half of the
contributions rai&s;ed by the French King in the&s;e countries,
&s;urely his Britannick-Maje&s;ty had an equal right to make
tho&s;e feel the burthen of the war who had favoured the
unju&s;t enterpri&s;es of his enemies. He expre&s;&s;ed his hope,
that the diet, after having duely con&s;idered the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
would, by way of advice, propo&s;e to his Imperial
Maje&s;ty that he &s;hould annul his mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent man|dates
and not only take effectual mea&s;ures to protect the
electorate and its allies, but al&s;o give orders for com|mencing
again&s;t the Empre&s;s-Queen, as archduche&s;s of
Au&s;tria, the Elector Palatine, and the Duke of Wirtem|berg,
&s;uch proceedings as &s;he wanted to enforce again&s;t
his Britannick Maje&s;ty, Elector of Brun&s;wick-Lunen|bourg.
For this purpo&s;e the mini&s;ter now reque&s;ted their
excellencies to a&s;k immediately the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions
for their principals. The re&s;t of this long memorial con|tained
a ju&s;tification of his Britannick Maje&s;ty's conduct
in deviating from the capitulation of Clo&s;ter-Seven; with
a refutation of the arguments adduced, and a retortion of
the reproaches levelled again&s;t the King of England, in
the paper or manife&s;to compo&s;ed and publi&s;hed under
the direction of the French mini&s;try, and intituled, &startq;A
Parallel of the Conduct of the King of France with that
of the King of England, relative to the Breach of the Capi|tulation
of Clo&s;ter-Seven by the Hanoverians.&endq; But to this
invective a more circum&s;tantial an&s;wer was publi&s;hed:
in which, among other curious particulars, the letter of
expo&s;tulation, &s;aid to have been written by the Pru&s;&s;ia$
monarch to the King of Great-Britain after the defea$
at Collin, is treated as an infamous piece of forgery, pro+duced
by &s;ome venal pen employed to impo&s;e upon th$
publick. The author al&s;o, in hi$ endeavours to demon+&s;trate
<PB N="357" REF="361">
his Britannick Maje&s;ty's aver&s;ion to a continental
war, very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that &startq;none but &s;uch as are
unacquainted with the maritime force of England, can be|lieve,
that, without a diver&s;ion on the continent, to em|ploy
part of the enemy's force, &s;he is not in a condition to
hope for &s;ucce&s;s, and maintain her &s;uperiority at &s;ea. Eng|land,
therefore, had no intere&s;t to foment quarrels or
wars in Europe; but, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, there was room
to fear that France would embrace a different &s;y&s;tem:
accordingly, &s;he took no pains to conceal her views, and
her envoys declared publickly that a war upon the conti|nent
was inevitable; and that the King's dominions in
Germany would be its principal object.&endq; He afterwards,
in the cour&s;e of his argumentation, adds, &startq;that they mu&s;t
be very ignorant, indeed, who imagine that the forces of
England are not able to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e of France, unle&s;s the
latter be hindered from turning all her efforts to the &s;ea.
In ca&s;e of a war upon the continent, the two powers mu&s;t
pay &s;ub&s;idies; only with this difference, that France can
employ her own land forces, and a&s;pire at conque&s;ts.&endq;
Such were the profe&s;&s;ed &s;entiments of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try,
founded upon eternal truth and demon&s;tration, and openly
avowed, when the bu&s;ine&s;s was to prove that it was not
the intere&s;t of Great-Britain to maintain a war upon the
continent; but, afterwards, when this continental war was
eagerly e&s;pou&s;ed, &s;o&s;tered, and cheri&s;hed by the blood and
trea&s;ure of the Engli&s;h nation, then the parti&s;ans of that
very mini&s;try, which had thus declared that England,
without any diver&s;ion on the continent of Europe, was
an over-match for France by &s;ea, which may be termed
the Briti&s;h element; then their parti&s;ans, their cham|pions,
declaimers, and dependants, were taught to ri&s;e in
rebellion again&s;t their former doctrine, and, in defiance of
common &s;en&s;e and reflextion, affirm that a diver&s;ion in
Germany was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue of
England's operations, in A&s;ia, Africa, and America. Not|with&s;tanding
all the facts and arguments a&s;&s;embled in this
elaborate memorial, to expo&s;e the ingratitude of the Em|pre&s;s-Queen,
and demon&s;trate the oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures
<PB N="358" REF="362">
adopted by the Imperial power, it remains to be proved,
that the member of a community is not obliged to yield
obedience to the re&s;olutions taken, and the decrees pub|li&s;hed,
by the majority of tho&s;e who compo&s;e this com|munity;
e&s;pecially when re-enforced with the authority
of the &s;upreme magi&s;trate, and not repugnant to the
fundamental con&s;titution on which that community was
e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. If the Empre&s;s-Queen was not gratified to
the extent of her wi&s;hes in the fortune of the campaign, at
lea&s;t her &s;elf-importance was flattered in another point,
which could not fail of being intere&s;ting to a prince&s;s famed
for a glowing zeal and inviolable attachment to the religion
of Rome. In the month of Augu&s;t the Pope conferred
upon her the title of Apo&s;tolical Queen of Hungary, con|veyed
by a brief, in which he extolled her piety, and
launched out into retro&s;pective eulogiums of her prede|ce&s;&s;ors,
the princes of Hungary, who had been always
accu&s;tomed to fight and overcome for the catholick faith
under this holy banner. This compliment, however,
&s;he did not derive from the regard of Pro&s;per Lambertini,
who exerci&s;ed the papal &s;way under the a&s;&s;umed name of
Benedict XIV. That pontiff, univer&s;ally e&s;teemed for his
good &s;en&s;e, moderation, and humanity, had breathed his
la&s;t in the month of April, in the eighty-fourth year of
his age; and in July was &s;ucceeded in the papacy by
Cardinal Charles Rezzonico, Bi&s;hop of Padua, by birth a
Venetian. He was formely auditor of the Rota; after|wards
promoted to the purple by Pope Clement XII. at
the nomination of the republick of Venice; was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by the title of St. Maria d'Ara Coeli, the princi|pal
convent of the Cordeliers, and nominated protector
of the Pandours, or Illyrians. When he a&s;cended the
papal chair, he a&s;&s;umed the name of Clement XIII. in
gratitude to the la&s;t of that name, who was his benefactor.
Though of a di&s;agreeable per&s;on, and even deformed in
his body, he enjoyed good health, and a vigorous con&s;ti|tution.
As an eccle&s;ia&s;tick, his life was exemplary; his
morals were pure and unimpeached; in his character he
<PB N="359" REF="363">
is &s;aid to have been learned, diligent, &s;teady, devout, and
in every re&s;pect worthy to &s;ucceed &s;uch a predece&s;&s;or as
Benedict.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. The King of Spain wi&s;ely per&s;i&s;ted in reaping
the advantages of a neutrality, notwith&s;tanding the in|trigues
of the French parti&s;ans at the court of Madrid,
who endeavoured to alarm his jealou&s;y by the conque&s;ts
which the Engli&s;h had projected in America. The King
of Sardinia &s;agaciou&s;ly kept aloof, re&s;olving, in imitation
of his predece&s;&s;ors, to maintain his power on a re&s;pectable
footing, and be ready to &s;ei&s;e all opportunities to extend
and promote the intere&s;t of his crown, and the advantage
of his country. As for the King of Portugal, he had
prudently embraced the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of forbearance; but
in the latter end of the &s;ea&s;on his attention was engro&s;&s;ed
by a dome&s;tick incident of a very extraordinary nature.
Whether he had, by particular in&s;tances of &s;everity, ex|a&s;perated
the minds of certain individuals, and exerci&s;ed
his dominion in &s;uch acts of arbitrary power as excited a
general &s;pirit of di&s;affection among his nobility; or,
la&s;tly, by the vigorous mea&s;ures pur&s;ued again&s;t the en|croaching
Je&s;uits in Paraguay, and their corre&s;pondents
in Portugal, had incurred the re&s;entment of that &s;ociety,
we &s;hall not pretend to determine: perhaps all the&s;e mo|tives
concurred in giving birth to a con&s;piracy again&s;t his
life, which was actually executed at this juncture with the
mo&s;t de&s;perate re&s;olution. On the third day of September,
the King, according to cu&s;tom, going out in a carriage to
take the air, accompanied by one dome&s;tick, was, in the
night, at a &s;olitary place near Belem, attacked by three
men on hor&s;eback, armed with mu&s;quetoons, one of whom
fired his piece at the coachman without effect. The man,
however, terrified both on his own account and that of his
&s;overeign's, drove the mules at full &s;peed; a circum&s;tance
which in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;concerted the other two
con&s;pirators, who pur&s;ued him at full gallop, and having
no lei&s;ure to take aim, di&s;charged their pieces at random
through the back of the carriage. The &s;lugs with which
<PB N="360" REF="364">
they were loaded happened to pa&s;s between the King's
right arm and his brea&s;t, dilacerating the parts from the
&s;houlder to the elbow, but without damaging the bone, or
penetrating into the cavity of the body. Finding him&s;elf
grievou&s;ly wounded, and the blood flowing a-pace, he,
with &s;uch pre&s;ence of mind as cannot be &s;ufficiently ad|mired,
in&s;tead of proceeding to the palace, which was at
&s;ome di&s;tance, ordered the coachman to return to Jun|queria,
where his principal &s;urgeon re&s;ided, and there his
wounds were immediately dre&s;&s;ed. By this re&s;olution, he
not only prevented the irreparable mi&s;chief that might
have ari&s;en from an exce&s;&s;ive effu&s;ion of blood; but, with|out
all doubt, &s;aved his life from the hands of other
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, po&s;ted on the road to accompli&s;h the regicide,
in ca&s;e he &s;hould e&s;cape alive from the fir&s;t attack. This
in&s;tance of the King's recollection was magnified into a
miracle, on a &s;uppo&s;ition that it mu&s;t have been the effect
of divine in&s;piration; and, indeed, among a people ad|dicted
to &s;uper&s;tition, might well pa&s;s for a favourable in|terpo&s;ition
of Providence. The King, being thus di&s;abled
in his right arm, i&s;&s;ued a decree, inve&s;ting the Queen with
the ab&s;olute power of government. In the mean time,
no per&s;on had acce&s;s to his pre&s;ence but her&s;elf, the fir&s;t
mini&s;ter, the Cardinal de Saldanha, the phy&s;icians, and
&s;urgeons. An embargo was immediately laid on all the
&s;hipping in the port of Li&s;bon. Rewards were publickly
offered, together with promi&s;e of pardon to the accom|plices,
for detecting any of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins; and &s;uch other
mea&s;ures u&s;ed, that in a little time the whole con&s;piracy
was di&s;covered: a con&s;piracy the more dangerous, as it
appeared to have been formed by per&s;ons of the fir&s;t quality
and influence. The Duke de Aveiro, of the family of
Ma&s;carenhas; the Marquis de Tavora, who had been
viceroy of Goa, and now actually enjoyed the commi&s;&s;ion
of general of the hor&s;e; the Count de Attouguia, the
Marquis de Alloria, together with their wives, children,
and whole families, were arre&s;ted immediately after the
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, as principals in the de&s;ign; and many other
<PB N="361" REF="365">
accomplices, including &s;ome Je&s;uits, were apprehended in
the &s;equel. The further proceedings on this my&s;terious
affair, with the fate of the con&s;pirators, will be particu|lari&s;ed
among the tran&s;actions of the following year. At
pre&s;ent, it will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the King's
wounds were attended with no bad con&s;equences; nor did
the impri&s;onment of tho&s;e noblemen produce any di&s;tur|bance
in the kingdom.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVI. The dome&s;tick occurrences of France were
ti&s;&s;ued with a continuation of the di&s;putes between the
parliaments and clergy, touching the bull Unigenitus.
In vain the King had interpo&s;ed his authority; fir&s;t
propo&s;ing an accommodation; then commanding the par|liament
to forbear taking cognizance of a religious conte&s;t,
which did not fall under their juri&s;diction; and, thirdly,
bani&s;hing their per&s;ons, and abrogating their power. He
afterwards found it nece&s;&s;ary to the peace of his dominions
to recall and re-in&s;tate tho&s;e venerable patriots; and,
being convinced of the intolerable in&s;olence and turbulent
&s;pirit of the Archbi&s;hop of Paris, had exiled that prelate
in his turn. He was no &s;ooner re-admitted to his function,
than he re&s;umed his former conduct, touching the denial
of the &s;acraments to tho&s;e who refu&s;ed to acknowledge the
bull Unigenitus: he even acted with redoubled zeal; in|trigued
with the other prelates; caballed among the in|ferior
clergy; and not only revived, but augmented, the
troubles throughout the whole kingdom. Bi&s;hops, cu|rates,
and monks pre&s;umed to with-hold &s;piritual con&s;o|lation
from per&s;ons in extremity, and were puni&s;hed by
the civil power. Other parliaments of the kingdom
followed the example exhibited by that of Paris, in a&s;&s;erting
their authority and privileges. The King commanded
them to de&s;i&s;t, on pain of incurring his indignation: they
remon&s;trated, and per&s;evered; while the Archbi&s;hop re|peated
his injunctions and cen&s;ures, and continued to in|flame
the di&s;pute to &s;uch a dangerous degree, that he was
given to under&s;tand he &s;hould be again obliged to quit the
capital, if he did not proceed with more moderation.
<PB N="362" REF="366">
But the chief care of the French mini&s;try was employed
in regulating the finances, and e&s;tabli&s;hing funds of credi$
for rai&s;ing money to pay &s;ub&s;idies, and maintain the wa$
in Europe and America. In the cour&s;e of this year they
had not only con&s;iderably re-enforced their armies in Ger$many,
but made &s;urpri&s;ing efforts to &s;upply the colony o$
Canada with troops, artillery, &s;tores, and ammunition
for its defence again&s;t the operations of the Briti&s;h forces
which greatly out-numbered the French upon the conti|nent.
The court of Ver&s;ailles practi&s;ed every &s;tratage$$
to elude the vigilance of the Engli&s;h crui&s;ers. The &s;hip$
de&s;tined for America they detached, both &s;ingle and i$
convoys, &s;ometimes from the Mediterranean, &s;ometime
from their harbours in the Channel. They a&s;&s;embled
tran&s;ports in one port, in order to withdraw the attention
of their enemies from another, where their convoys lay
ready for &s;ailing; and in boi&s;terous weather, when the$
Engli&s;h could no longer block up their harbours, their
&s;tore&s;hips came forth, and hazarded the voyage, for the
relief of their American &s;ettlements. Tho&s;e that had the
good fortune to arrive on the coa&s;t of that continent were
obliged to have recour&s;e to different expedients for e&s;caping
the Briti&s;h &s;quadrons &s;tationed at Halifax, or crui&s;ing in
the bay of St. Laurence. They either ventured to navi|gate
the river before it was clear of the ice, &s;o early in the
&s;pring, that the enemy had not yet quitted the harbour o$
Nova-Scotia; or they waited on the coa&s;t of Newfound|land
for &s;uch thick fogs as might &s;creen them from th$
notice of the Engli&s;h crui&s;ers, in &s;ailing up the gulf
or, la&s;tly, they penetrated through the Straits of Bellei&s;le
a dangerous pa&s;&s;age, which, however, led them direct$
into the river St. Laurence, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tan$$
above the &s;tation of the Briti&s;h &s;quadron. Though th$
French navy was by this time &s;o reduced, that it coul$
neither face the Engli&s;h at &s;ea, nor furni&s;h proper convoy
for commerce, her mini&s;try neverthele&s;s attempted $word$
alarm the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain with the project of a
inva&s;ion. Flat-bottomed boats were built, tran&s;por$
<PB N="363" REF="367">
collected, large &s;hips of the line equipped, and troops
ordered to a&s;&s;emble on the coa&s;t for embarkation; but this
was no more than a feint to arou&s;e the apprehen&s;ion of the
Engli&s;h, di&s;concert the admini&s;tration, prejudice the na|tional
credit, and deter the government from &s;ending forces
to keep alive the war in Germany. A much more effectual
method they took to di&s;tre&s;s the trade of England, by
laying up their u&s;ele&s;s &s;hips of war, and encouraging the
equipment of &s;tout privateers, which did con&s;iderable da|mage
to the commerce of Great-Britain and Ireland, by
crui&s;ing in the &s;eas of Europe and America. Some of them
lay clo&s;e in the harbours of the Channel, fronting the coa&s;t
of England, and darted out occa&s;ionally on the trading
&s;hips of this na$ion, as they received intelligence from
boats employed for that purpo&s;e. Some cho&s;e their &s;tation
in the North-Sea, where a great number of captures were
made upon the coa&s;t of Scotland; others crui&s;ed in the chops
of the Channel, and even to the we&s;tward of Ireland; but
the far greater number &s;coured the &s;eas in the neighbourhood
of the Leeward I&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies, where they took
a prodigious number of Briti&s;h &s;hips, &s;ailing to and from the
&s;ugar-colonies, and conveyed them to their own &s;ettle|ments
in Martinique, Guadaloupe, or St. Domingo.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVII. With re&s;pect to the war that raged in Ger|many,
the King of Denmark wi&s;ely pur&s;ued that cour&s;e
which happily pre&s;erved him from being involved in tho&s;e
troubles by which great part of Europe was agitated, and
terminated in that point of national advantage which a
king ought over to have in view for the benefit of his
people. By ob&s;erving a &s;crupulous neutrality, he enhanced
his importance among his neighbours: he &s;aw him&s;elf
courted by all the belligerent powers: he &s;aved the blood
and trea&s;ure of his &s;ubjects: he received large &s;ub&s;idies,
in con&s;ideration of his forbearance; and enjoyed, unmo|$e&s;ted,
a much more con&s;iderable &s;hare of commerce than
he could expect to carry on, even in times of univer&s;al
$ranquillity. He could not perceive that the prote&s;tant
religion had any thing to apprehend from the confederacy
<PB N="364" REF="368">
which was formed again&s;t the Pru&s;&s;ian monarch; nor wa$
he mi&s;led into all the expence, the perils, and di&s;qniets $word$
a &s;anguinary war, by that <HI>ignis fatuus</HI> which hath &s;educe$
and impoveri&s;hed other opulent nations, under the &s;peciou$
title of the balance of power in Germany. How&s;oever h$
might be &s;wayed by private inclination, he did not thin$
it was a point of con&s;equence to his kingdom whethe$
Pomerania was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Sweden or Pru&s;&s;ia; whethe$
the French army was driven back beyond the Rhine, o$
penetrated once more into the electorate of Hanover$
whether the Empre&s;s-Queen was &s;tripped of her remainin$
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Sile&s;ia, or the King of Pru&s;&s;ia circum&s;cribe$
within the original bound of his dominion. He took $word$
for granted that France, for her own &s;ake, would pre$vent
the ruin of that enterpri&s;ing monarch; and that th$
hou&s;e of Au&s;tria would not be &s;o impolitick, and blind t$
its own intere&s;t, as to permit the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia to mak$
and retain conque&s;ts in the Empire: but, even if the$
powers &s;hould be weak enough to &s;acrifice all the maxim$
of &s;ound policy to caprice or re&s;entment, he did not thin$
him&s;elf &s;o deeply concerned in the event, as, for the di&s;tan$
pro&s;pect of what might po&s;&s;ibly happen, to plunge headlon$
into a war that mu&s;t be attended with certain and imme$diate
di&s;advantages. True it is, he had no hereditary electo$rate
in Germany that was threatened with inva&s;ion; no$
if he had, is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that a prince of his &s;agacit$
and patrioti&s;m would have impoveri&s;hed his kingdom o$
Denmark, for the precarious defence of a di&s;tant territory&punc;
It was re&s;erved for another nation to adopt the perniciou$
ab&s;urdity of wa&s;ting its blood and trea&s;ure, exhau&s;ting i$
revenues, loading its own back with the mo&s;t grievous i$$
po&s;itions, incurring an enormous debt, big with bankrupt$$
and ruin; in a word, of expending above an hundred an$
fifty millions &s;terling in fruitle&s;s efforts to defend a di&s;tan$
country, the entire property of which was never valued a$
one twentieth part of that &s;um; a country with which $word$
had no natural connexion; but a common alliance ari&s;in
from accident. The King of Denmark, though him&s;el$
<PB N="365" REF="369">
a prince of the Empire, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of dominions in
Germany, almo&s;t contiguous to the &s;cenes of the pre&s;ent
war, did not yet think him&s;elf &s;o nearly concerned in the
i&s;&s;ue, as to declare him&s;elf either principal or auxiliary in
the quarrel: yet he took care to maintain his forces by
&s;ea and land upon a re&s;pectable footing: and, by this con|duct,
he provided not only for the &s;ecurity of his own
country, but over-awed the belligerent powers, who con|&s;idered
him as a prince capable of making either &s;cale pre|ponderate,
ju&s;t as he might choo&s;e to trim the balance.
Thus he pre&s;erved his wealth, commerce, and con&s;equence
undimini&s;hed; and, in&s;tead of being harra&s;&s;ed as a party,
was honoured as an umpire.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVIII. The United Provinces, though as adver&s;e
as his Dani&s;h Maje&s;ty to any participation in the war, did
not, however, &s;o &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erve the neutrality they
profe&s;&s;ed: at lea&s;t, the traders of that republick, either
from an inordinate thir&s;t of lucre, or a &s;ecret bia&s;s in favour
of the enemies of Great-Britain, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the French com|merce
with all the appearance of the mo&s;t flagrant par|tiality.
We have, in the beginning of this year's tran&s;|actions,
ob&s;erved, that a great number of their &s;hips were
taken by the Engli&s;h crui&s;ers, and condemned as legal
prizes, for having French property on board: that the
Dutch merchants, exa&s;perated by their lo&s;&s;es, exclaimed
again&s;t the Engli&s;h as pirates and robbers, petitioned the
States for redre&s;s in very high terms, and even loudly cla|moured
for a war again&s;t Great-Britain. The charge of
violence and inju&s;tice which they brought again&s;t the En|gli&s;h,
for taking and confi&s;cating the &s;hips that tran&s;ported
to Europe the produce of the French i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies,
they founded on the tenth article of the treaty of
commerce between Great-Britain and the States-General
of the United Provinces, concluded in the year one thou|&s;and
&s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-eight, &s;tipulating, &startq;That
whatever &s;hall be found on board the &s;hips of the &s;ubjects
of the United Provinces, though the lading, or part thereof,
may belong to the enemies of Great-Britain, &s;hall be free
<PB N="366" REF="370">
and unmole&s;ted; except the&s;e be prohibited goods
which are to be &s;erved in the manner pre&s;cribed by the
foregoing articles.&endq; From this article the Dutch mer$chants
argued, that, if there be no prohibited goods or
board, the Engli&s;h had no right to &s;top or mole&s;t any o$
their &s;hips, or make the lea&s;t enquiry to whom the mer|chandi&s;e
belonged, whence it was brought, or whither
bound. This plea the Engli&s;h ca&s;ui&s;ts would by no mean$
admit, for the following rea&s;ons: A general and perpe|tual
licen&s;e to carry on the whole trade of their enemy
would be &s;uch a glaring ab&s;urdity, as no convention could
authori&s;e: common &s;en&s;e has dictated, and Grotius de|clared,
that no man can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have con&s;ented to
an ab&s;urdity; therefore, the interpretation given by the
Dutch to this article could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be its true
and genuine meaning; which, indeed, relates to nothing
more than the common cour&s;e of trade, as it was u&s;ually
carried on in time of peace. But, even &s;hould this in+terpretation
be accepted, the article, and the treaty it&s;el$
would be &s;uper&s;eded and annulled by a &s;ub&s;equent treaty
concluded between the two nations in the year one thou+&s;and
&s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-five, and often confirmed
&s;ince that period, &s;tipulating, in a &s;ecret article, Tha$
neither of the contracting parties &s;hould give, nor con+&s;ent
that any of their &s;ubjects and inhabitants &s;hould give
any aid, favour, or council, directly or indirectly, by
land or &s;ea, or on the fre&s;h waters; nor &s;hould furni&s;h
or permit the &s;ubjects or inhabitants of their re&s;pectiv$
territories to furni&s;h, any &s;hips, &s;oldiers, &s;eamen, victuals
monies, in&s;truments of war, gunpowder, or any othe$
nece&s;&s;aries for making war, to the enemies of either party
of any rank or condition &s;oever. Now, the Dutch hav$
infringed this article in many in&s;tances during the pre&s;e$
war, both in Europe and America; and, as they have $
openly contravened one treaty, the Engli&s;h are n$
obliged to ob&s;erve any other. They, moreover, forfeited:
right to the ob&s;ervance of the treaty in que&s;tion, by r$+fu&s;ing
the &s;uccours with which they were bound, in $word$
<PB N="367" REF="371">
mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to furni&s;h the King of Great-Bri|tain,
in ca&s;e any of his territories in Europe &s;hould be
attacked: for nothing could be more weak and frivolous
than the allegation upon which this refu&s;al was founded;
namely, that the ho&s;tilities in Europe were commenced
by the Engli&s;h, when they &s;ei&s;ed and confi&s;cated the ve&s;&s;els
of France; and they, being the aggre&s;&s;ors, had no right
to in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;uccours &s;tipulated in a treaty which
was purely defen&s;ive. If this argument has any weight,
the treaty it&s;elf can have no &s;ignification. The French,
as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, will always commence the war in
America; and when their &s;hips, containing re-enforce|ments
and &s;tores for the maintenance of that war, &s;hall be
taken on the European &s;eas, perhaps in con&s;equence of
their being expo&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, they will exclaim
that the Engli&s;h were the aggre&s;&s;ors in Europe, con&s;e|quently
deprived of all benefit accruing from the defen&s;ive
treaty &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them and the States-General of
the United Provinces. It being impo&s;&s;ible for the Engli&s;h
to terminate the war, while their enemies derive the &s;inews
of it from their commerce carried on in neutral bottoms,
they are obliged to &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch collu&s;ions, by that ne|ce&s;&s;ity
which Grotius him&s;elf hath allowed to be a &s;uffi|cient
excu&s;e for deviating from the letter of any treaty what|&s;oever.
In time of peace no Dutch &s;hips were permitted
to carry the produce of any French &s;ugar i&s;land, or even
to trade in any of the French ports in America or the
We&s;t-Indies; con&s;equently, the treaty which they quote
can never ju&s;tify them in carrying on a commerce, which,
as it did not exi&s;t, and was not fore&s;een, could not po&s;&s;ibly
be guarded again&s;t when that convention was ratified.
Grotius, who&s;e authority is held in &s;uch veneration among
the Dutch, has determined that every nation has a right
to &s;ei&s;e and confi&s;cate the goods of any neutral power,
which &s;hall attempt to carry them into any place which is
blocked up by that nation, either by land or &s;ea. The
French i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies were &s;o blocked
$p by the Engli&s;h crui&s;ers, that they could receive no
<PB N="368" REF="372">
relief from their own government, con&s;equently no neu|tral
power could attempt to &s;upply them without falling
under this predicament<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the reign of King William, when the Engli&s;h and Dutch were engaged in a war again&s;t France, the northern powers of Sweden and Denmark at|tempted to carry on the French commerce, under the &s;hade of neutrality: but the Dutch and Engli&s;h joined in &s;ei&s;ing the ve&s;&s;els that were thus employ|ed. Complaints of the&s;e captures were made at London and the Hague, and the complainants were given to under&s;tand at both places, that they &s;hould not be allowed to carry on any trade with France, but what was u&s;ual in time of peace. In con&s;equence of this declaration, Mr. Groning formed the de&s;ign of writing a treati&s;e on the freedom of navigation, and communicated the plan of his work to the celebrated Pu&s;&s;endorf, who &s;ignified his &s;entiments in a let|ter, which is pre&s;erved by the learned Barbeyrac, in his notes upon that au|thor's treati&s;e on the law of nature and nations.</NOTE>. It was for the&s;e rea&s;ons that the
King of England declared, by the mouth of Mr. Yorke,
his mini&s;ter plenipotentiary at the Hague, in a conference
held in the month of Augu&s;t with the deputies of the States-General,
that though he was ready to concur in every
mea&s;ure that &s;hould be propo&s;ed for giving &s;atisfaction to
their High Mightine&s;&s;es, with whom he had always &s;tudied
to live in the mo&s;t perfect union, he was neverthele&s;s de|termined
not to &s;uffer the trade of the French colonies in
America to be carried on by the &s;ubjects of other powers,
under the &s;pecious pretext of neutrality: nor to permit
words to be interpreted as a licen&s;e to drive a trade with
his enemies, which, though not particularly &s;pecified in
the articles of contraband, was neverthele&s;s rendered &s;uch
in all re&s;pects, and in every &s;en&s;e, by the nature of the cir|cum&s;tances. It is not all the more &s;urpri&s;ing that the
Dutch merchants &s;hould complain, than that the Engli&s;h
government &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in confi&s;cating the &s;hips that
were found to contain the merchandi&s;e of their enemies.
The individual traders of every mercantile nation will run
con&s;iderable ri&s;ques in extending their particular commerce,
even when they know it mu&s;t be detrimental to the gene|ral
intere&s;t of their country. In the war maintained by
the confederates again&s;t Louis XIV. of France, the mer|chants
&s;hips of the Dutch carried on an uninterrupted trade
to the French ports; and, notwith&s;tanding the repeated
<PB N="369" REF="373">
&s;ollicitations of England, the States-General could never
be prevailed upon to prohibit this commerce, which un|doubtedly
enabled France to protract the war. The truth
is, they gave the Briti&s;h mini&s;try to under&s;tand, that unle&s;s
they connived at this traffick, their &s;ubjects could not
po&s;&s;ibly defray their proportion of the expen&s;e at which the
war was maintained. It is well known through all Eu|rope,
that the &s;ubjects of the United Provinces reaped
con&s;iderable advantage, not only from this branch of
illicit trade, but al&s;o by providing for both armies in
Flanders, and by the practice of &s;tock-jobbing in Eng|land;
con&s;equently, it was not the intere&s;t, either of the
States-General, or the Engli&s;h general, between whom
there was a very good under&s;tanding, to bring that war
to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion; not, indeed, ought we to fix the
imputation of partiality upon a whole nation, for the pri|vate
conduct of individuals, influenced by motives of &s;elf-intere&s;t,
which operate with the &s;ame energy in Holland,
and among the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain. In the cour&s;e
of the former war, &s;uch a &s;candalous appetite for gain pre|vailed
in different parts of the Briti&s;h dominions, that the
French i&s;lands were actually &s;upplied with provi&s;ions,
&s;laves, and lumber from Ireland and the Briti&s;h colonies
in North America; and Martinique, in particular, mu&s;t
have &s;urrendered to the commander of the Engli&s;h &s;qua|dron
&s;tationed in tho&s;e &s;eas, had it not been thus &s;upported
by Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. Certain it is, the Dutch had &s;ome
rea&s;on to complain that they were decoyed into this &s;pecies
of traffick by the article of a treaty, which, in their opi|nion,
admitted of no limitation; and that the govern|ment
of Great-Britain, without any previous warning
or explaining its &s;entiments on this &s;ubject, &s;wept the &s;ea
at once of all the ve&s;&s;els employed in this commerce, and
condemned them, without mitigation, to the entire ruin
of many thou&s;and families. Con&s;idering the intimate
connexion of mutual intere&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between Great-Britain
and the States of the United Provinces, they &s;eem
to have had &s;ome right to an intimation of this nature,
<PB N="370" REF="374">
which, in all probability, would have induced them to
re&s;ign all pro&s;pect of advantage from the pro&s;ecution of
&s;uch a traffick.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIX. Be&s;ides the univer&s;al clamour excited in Hol|land,
and the famous memorial pre&s;ented to the States-General,
which we have already mentioned in another
place, a deputation of merchants waited four times
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively on the Prince&s;s Regent, to explain their grie|vances,
and demand her concurrence in augmenting the
navy for the pre&s;ervation of their commerce. She pro|mi&s;ed
to interpo&s;e her be&s;t offices with the court of Great-Britain;
and the&s;e co-operating with repre&s;entations made
by the States-General, the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter was empow|ered
to open conferences at the Hague, in order to bring
all matters in di&s;pute to an amicable accommodation.
The&s;e endeavours, however, proved ineffectual. The
Briti&s;h crui&s;ers continued to take, and the Briti&s;h courts
to condemn, all Dutch ve&s;&s;els containing the produce of
the French &s;ugar i&s;lands. The merchants of Holland and
Zealand renewed their complaints with redoubled cla|mour,
and all the trading part of the nation, re-enforced
by the whole party that oppo&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Orange,
cried aloud for an immediate augmentation of the marine,
and repri&s;als upon the pirates of England. The Prince&s;s,
in order to avoid extremities, was obliged not only to em|ploy
all her per&s;onal influence with the States-General, but
al&s;o to play off one faction again&s;t another, in the way of
remon&s;trance and exclamation. As far back as the month
of June, &s;he pre&s;ented a memorial to the States-General,
reminding them, that in the beginning of the war between
France and England &s;he had advi&s;ed an augmentation
&s;hould be made in their land forces, to &s;trengthen the gar|ri&s;ons
of the frontier towns, and cover the territories of the
republick from inva&s;ion. She gave them to unde&s;tand,
that the provinces of Gueldres and Overy&s;&s;el, intimidated
by the proximity of two formidable armies, had re&s;olved to
demand that the augmentation of their land-forces &s;hould
be taken into con&s;ideration by the other provinces; and
<PB N="371" REF="375">
reque&s;ted her to re-enforce their &s;ollicitations that this
mea&s;ure might immediately take place. This reque&s;t, &s;he
&s;aid, &s;he the more readily granted, as &s;he could not but be
&s;en&s;ible of the imminent danger that threatened the re|publick,
e&s;pecially &s;ince the Hanoverian army had pa&s;&s;ed
the Rhine; and as it behoved the &s;tate to put it&s;elf in a
condition to hinder either army from retiring into the ter|ritories
of the republick, if it &s;hould be defeated; for, in
that ca&s;e, the conqueror being authori&s;ed to pur&s;ue his
enemy wherever he can find him, would bring the war into
the hear of their country. This repre&s;entation had no
other effect than that of &s;u&s;pending the mea&s;ure which
each party propo&s;ed. The Prince&s;s, in her an&s;wer to the
fourth deputation of the merchants, declared that &s;he
beheld the pre&s;ent &s;tate of their trade with the mo&s;t anxious
concern; that its want of protection was not her fault,
but that of the towns of Dort, Haerlem, Am&s;terdam, Tor|gau,
Rotterdam, and the Brille, to who&s;e conduct it was
owing, that the forces of the &s;tate, by &s;ea and land, were
not now on a better footing. The deputies were after|wards
referred to her mini&s;ter, M. de la Larrey, to whom
they repre&s;ented, that the augmentation of the land-forces,
and the equipment of a fleet, were matters as di&s;tinct from
each other as light from darkne&s;s: that there was no
pre&s;&s;ing motive for an augmentation of the army, whereas,
innumerable rea&s;onable rea&s;ons rendered the equipment of
a fleet a matter of the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity. In a few
days after this repre&s;entation was made, the Prince&s;s, in
an a&s;&s;embly of the States-General, reque&s;ted their High
Mightine&s;&s;es, that &s;eeing their earne&s;t and repeated efforts
to induce the provinces of Holland, Zealand, Frie&s;land,
and We&s;t-Frie&s;land to acquie&s;ce in the propo&s;ed augmen|tation
of forces by &s;ea and land had not hitherto met with
&s;ucce&s;s, they would now con&s;ider and deliberate upon &s;ome
expedient for terminating this affair, and the &s;ooner the
better, in order, on one hand, to &s;atisfy the &s;trong and well-grounded
in&s;tances made by the provinces of Gueldres,
Utrecht, Overy&s;&s;el, and Groningen; and, on the other,
<PB N="372" REF="376">
to comply with the ardent ju&s;t de&s;ires expre&s;&s;ed by the
commercial inhabitants of the country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1758.</NOTE> She told them
that the deputation which waited on her con&s;i&s;ted of forty
merchants, a number that merited attention no le&s;s than
the &s;peech they pronounced, of which a great number of
printed copies were di&s;tributed through all parts of the
country. Without making any particular remarks on
the harangue, &s;he only ob&s;erved, that the drift of it did
not tend to facilitate the negociation begun with Great-Britain,
nor to induce the nation to prefer a convention
to a rupture with that crown. From this circum&s;tance
&s;he inferred, it was more than time to fini&s;h the delibe|rations
on the propo&s;al for augmenting the forces both
by &s;ea and land; a mea&s;ure, without which &s;he was con|vinced
in her con&s;cience the &s;tate was, and would always
remain expo&s;ed to all &s;orts of mi&s;fortune and danger,
both now and hereafter.</P>
<P>&sect; L. In con&s;equence of this interpo&s;ition, the States-General
that &s;ame day &s;ent a letter to the &s;tates of Holland
and We&s;t-Frie&s;land, communicating the &s;entiments of the
Prince&s;s Regent, and in&s;i&s;ting upon the nece&s;&s;ity of com|plying
with her propo&s;al of the double augmentation.
They ob&s;erved, that an augmentation of the land-forces,
for the defence of the frontiers, was unavoidable, as well
as an equipment by &s;ea for the &s;ecurity of commerce: that
the &s;tates of the provinces of Gueldres, Utrecht, Overy&s;&s;el,
and Groningen joined with them in the &s;ame opinion;
and accordingly had in&s;i&s;ted, by divers letters and pro|po&s;itions,
on tho&s;e two points &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the publick
intere&s;t. They repre&s;ented the danger of delay, and the
fatal effects of di&s;cord: they propo&s;ed, that by a reciprocal
indulgence one party &s;hould comply with the &s;entiments
of the other, in order to avoid a &s;chi&s;m and dangerous di|vi&s;ion
among the confederates, the con&s;equences of which
would be very deplorable; while the republick, in the
mean time, would remain in a defencele&s;s condition, both
by &s;ea and land, and depend upon the arbitrary power of
its neighbours. They conjured them, therefore, as they
<PB N="373" REF="377">
valued the &s;afety of their country, and all that was dear
to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. X. 1758.</NOTE> as they regarded the protection of the good in|habitants,
the concord and harmony which at all times,
but e&s;pecially at the pre&s;ent critical juncture, was of the
la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, that they would &s;eriou&s;ly reflect upon the ex|hortation
of her royal highne&s;s, as well as on the repeated
in&s;tances of the majority of the confederates; and take a
wi&s;e and &s;alutary re&s;olution with regard to the propo&s;ed
augmentation of the land-forces, &s;o that this addition,
together with an equipment at &s;ea, might, the &s;ooner the
better, be unanimou&s;ly brought to a conclu&s;ion. It was
undoubtedly the duty of all who wi&s;hed well to their
country to moderate the heat and precipitation of tho&s;e,
who, provoked by their lo&s;&s;es, and &s;timulated by re&s;ent|ment,
end eavoured at this period to involve their nation in
a war with Great-Britain. Had matters been pu&s;hed to
this extremity, in a few months the republick would, in
all probability, have been brought to the brink of ruin.
The Dutch were di&s;tracted by internal divi&s;ions; they were
altogether unprovided for ho&s;tilities by &s;ea; the ocean was
covered with their trading ve&s;&s;els; and the naval arma|ments
of Great-Britain were &s;o numerous and powerful as
to render all re&s;i&s;tance on that element equally vain and
pernicious. The Engli&s;h could not only have &s;coured
the &s;eas, and made prize of all their &s;hipping, but were
al&s;o in a condition to reduce or demoli&s;h all their towns
in Zealand, where they would hardly have met with
any oppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>&sect; I. WHILE the operations of the war were pro&s;e|cuted
through the four quarters of the globe,
the i&s;land of Great-Britain, which may be termed the
centre that gave motion to this va&s;t machine, enjoyed all
the tranquillity of the mo&s;t profound peace, and &s;aw no|thing
of war but the preparations and trophies, which
&s;erved only to animate the nation to a de&s;ire of further
conque&s;t; for the dejection occa&s;ioned by the misfortune at
St. Cas &s;oon vani&s;hed before the pro&s;pect of victory and
&s;ucce&s;s. Con&s;idering the agitation naturally produced
among the common people by the practice of pre&s;&s;ing men
into the &s;ervice of the navy, which in the beginning of the
year had been carried on with unu&s;ual violence, the levy
of &s;o many new corps of &s;oldiers, and the endeavours u&s;ed
in forming the national militia, very few di&s;turbances hap|pened
to interrupt the internal repo&s;e of the nation. From
private acts of malice, fraud, violence, and rapine no com|munity
what&s;oever is exempted. In the month of April,
the temporary wooden-bridge over the Thames, built for
the conveniency of carriages and pa&s;&s;engers, while the
workmen &s;hould be employed in widening and repairing
London-Bridge, was maliciou&s;ly &s;et on fire in the night,
and continued burning till noon next day, when the ruins
of it fell into the river. The de&s;truction of this conve|niency
proved very detrimental to the commerce of the
city, notwith&s;tanding the vigilancy and di&s;cretion of the
<PB N="376" REF="380">
magi&s;trates, in applying remedies for this misfortune. A
promi&s;e of the King's pardon was offered in a publick ad|verti&s;ement,
by the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and a reward of two
hundred pounds by the city of London to any per&s;on who
&s;hould di&s;cover the perpetrator of &s;uch wicked outrage;
but neverthele&s;s he e&s;caped detection. No individual,
nor any &s;ociety of men, could have the lea&s;t intere&s;t in the
execution of &s;uch a &s;cheme, except the body of London
watermen; but as no di&s;covery was made to the prejudice
of any per&s;on belonging to that &s;ociety, the deed was im|puted
to the malice of &s;ome &s;ecret enemy to the publick.
Even after a new temporary bridge was erected, another
attempt was made (in all probability by the &s;ame incen|diary)
to reduce the whole to a&s;hes, but happily mi&s;carried,
and a guard was appointed, to prevent any &s;uch atrocious
efforts in the &s;equel. Dangerous tumults were rai&s;ed in
and about Manche&s;ter, by a prodigious number of manu|facturers,
who had left off working, and entered into a
combination to rai&s;e, by force, the price of their labour.
They had formed a regular plan, and collecting large &s;ums
for the maintenance of the poorer &s;ort, while they refu&s;ed
to work for their families. They in&s;ulted and abu&s;ed all
tho&s;e who would not join in this defection; di&s;per&s;ed
incendiary letters, and denounced terrible threats again&s;t
all &s;uch as &s;hould pre&s;ume to oppo&s;e their proceedings.
But the&s;e menaces had no effect upon the magi&s;trates and
ju&s;tices, who did their duty with &s;uch di&s;cretion and cou|rage,
that the ringleaders being &s;ingled out, and puni&s;h|ed
by law, the re&s;t were &s;oon reduced to order.</P>
<P>&sect; II. In the month of June, Florence Hen&s;ey, an ob|&s;cure
phy&s;ician, and native of Ireland, who had been ap|prehended
for trea&s;onable practices, was tried in the court
of King's-Bench, on an indictment for high trea&s;on. In
the cour&s;e of the trial it appeared that he had been em|ployed
as a &s;py for the French mini&s;try; to which, in
con&s;ideration of a paltry pen&s;ion, he &s;ent intelligence of
every material occurrence in Great-Britain. The cor|re&s;pondence
was managed by his brother, a Je&s;uit, who
<PB N="377" REF="381">
acted as chaplain and &s;ecretary to the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;adour
at the Hague. The Briti&s;h re&s;ident at that court having
learned from the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter &s;ome &s;ecrets relating to
England, even before they were communicated to him
from the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, was induced to &s;et on foot an
enquiry touching the &s;ource of this information, and &s;oon
received an a&s;&s;urance, that the &s;ecretary of the Spani&s;h
amba&s;&s;adour had a brother, a phy&s;ician, in London. The
&s;u&s;picion naturally ari&s;ing from this circum&s;tance being
imparted to the mini&s;try of England, Hen&s;ey was nar|rowly
watched, and twenty-nine of his letters were inter|cepted.
From the contents of the&s;e he was convicted of
having given the French court the fir&s;t notice of the expe|dition
to North-America, the capture of the two &s;hips,
the Alcide and Lys, the &s;ailing and de&s;tination of every
&s;quadron and armament, and the difficulties that occurred
in rai&s;ing money for the &s;ervice of the publick. He had
even informed them that the &s;ecret expedition of the fore|going
year was intended again&s;t Rochefort, and advi&s;ed a
de&s;cent upon Great-Britain, at a certain time and place,
as the mo&s;t effectual method of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the govern|ment,
and affecting the publick credit. After a long
trial he was found guilty of trea&s;on, and received the &s;en|tence
of death u&s;ually pronounced on &s;uch occa&s;ions: but
whether he earned forgivene&s;s by &s;ome material di&s;covery,
or the mini&s;ter found him &s;o in&s;en&s;ible and in&s;ignificant
that he was a&s;hamed to take his life, he e&s;caped execution,
and was pardoned, on condition of going into perpetual
exile. The &s;everity of the governmont was much about
the &s;ame period exerci&s;ed on Dr. Shebbeare, a publick
writer, who, in a &s;eries of printed letters to the people of
England, had animadverted on the conduct of the mini&s;try
in the mo&s;t acrimonious terms, &s;tigmati&s;ed &s;ome great
names with all the virulence of cen&s;ure, and even a&s;&s;aulted
the throne it&s;elf with oblique in&s;inuation and ironical
&s;atire. The mini&s;try, incen&s;ed at the boldne&s;s, and &s;till
more enraged at the &s;ucce&s;s of this author, who&s;e writings
were bought with avidity by the publick, determined to
<PB N="378" REF="382">
puni&s;h him &s;everely for his arrogance and abu&s;e, and he
was apprehended by a warrant from the &s;ecretary's office.
His &s;ixth letter to the people of England was pitched upon
as the foundation of a pro&s;ecution. After a &s;hort trial in
the court of King's-Bench, he was found guilty of having
written the &s;ixth letter to the people of England, adjudged
a libellous pamphlet, &s;entenced to &s;tand in the pillory, to
pay a &s;mall fine, to be impri&s;oned three years, and give
&s;ecurity for his future good behaviour: &s;o that, in effect, this
good man &s;uffered more for having given vent to the un|guarded
effu&s;ions of mi&s;taken zeal, couched in the language
of pa&s;&s;ion and &s;currility, than was inflicted upon Hen&s;ey,
a convicted traitor, who had acted as a &s;py for France,
and betrayed his own country for hire.</P>
<P>&sect; III. Amid&s;t a variety of crimes and di&s;orders, ari&s;ing
from impetuo&s;ity of temper, unreined pa&s;&s;ion, luxury, ex|travagance,
and an almo&s;t total want of police and &s;ubor|dination,
the virtues of benevolence are always &s;pringing
up to an extraordinary growth in the Briti&s;h &s;oil; and here
charities are often e&s;tabli&s;hed by the humanity of indivi|duals,
which in any other country would be honoured as
national in&s;titutions: witne&s;s the great number of ho&s;|pitals
and infimaries in London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, erected
and maintained by voluntary contributions, or rai&s;ed by
the princely donations of private founders. In the cour&s;e
of this year the publick began to enjoy the benefit of &s;e|veral
admirable in&s;titutions. Mr. Henry Raine, a private
gentleman of Middle&s;ex, had, in his life-time, built an$
endowed an ho&s;pital for the maintenance of forty poo$
maidens. By his will he bequeathed a certain &s;um of mo-ney
to accumulate at intere&s;t, under the management o$
tru&s;tees, until the yearly produce &s;hould amount to two
hundred and ten pounds, to be given in marriage-portion
to two of the maidens educated in his ho&s;pital, at the ag$
of twenty-two, who &s;hould be the be&s;t recommended &s;o
piety and indu&s;try by the ma&s;ters or mi&s;tre&s;&s;es whom the
had &s;erved. In the month of March, the &s;um de&s;tined &s;o
this laudable purpo&s;e was completed; when the tru&s;tees
<PB N="379" REF="383">
by publick adverti&s;ement, &s;ummoned the maidens educated
in the ho&s;pital to appear on a certain day, with proper cer|tificates
of their behaviour and circum&s;tances, that &s;ix of
the mo&s;t de&s;erving might be &s;elected to draw lots for the
prize of one hundred pounds, to be paid as her marriage
portion, provided &s;he married a man of an unblemi&s;hed
character, a member of the church of England, re&s;iding
within certain &s;pecified pari&s;hes, and approved by the
tru&s;tees. Accordingly, on the fir&s;t of May the candidates
appeared, and the prize being gained by one young wo|man,
in pre&s;ence of a numerous a&s;&s;embly of all ranks,
attracted by curio&s;ity, the other five maidens, with a &s;ixth,
added in lieu of her who had been &s;ucce&s;sful, were marked
for a &s;econd chance on the &s;ame day of the following year,
when a &s;econd prize of the &s;ame value would be pre&s;ented:
thus a new candidate will be added every year, that every
maiden who has been educated in this ho&s;pital, and pre|&s;erved
her character without reproach, may have a chance
for the noble donation, which is al&s;o accompanied with the
&s;um of five pounds to defray the expen&s;e of the wedding
entertainment. One &s;carce knows whether mo&s;t to ad|mire
the plan, or commend the humanity of this excellent
in&s;titution. Of equal and perhaps &s;uperior merit was
another charitable e&s;tabli&s;hment, which al&s;o took effect
about this period. A &s;mall number of humane indivi|duals,
chiefly citizens of London, deeply affected with the
&s;ituation of common pro&s;titutes, who are certainly the
mo&s;t forlorn of all human creatures, formed a generous
re&s;olution in their favour, &s;uch as even the be&s;t men of the
kingdom had never before the courage to avow. They
con&s;idered that many of the&s;e unhappy creatures, &s;o
wretched in them&s;elves, and &s;o productive of mi&s;chief to
&s;ociety, had been &s;educed to vice in their tender years by
the perfidious artifice of the other &s;ex, or the violence of
unruly pa&s;&s;ion, before they had acquired experience to
guard again&s;t the one, or fore&s;ight to perceive the fatal
con&s;equences of the other: that the jewel, reputation,
being thus irretrievably lo&s;t, perhaps in one unguarded
<PB N="380" REF="384">
moment, they were covered with &s;hame and di&s;grace,
abandoned by their families, excluded from all pity, re|gard,
and a&s;&s;i&s;tance: that, &s;tung by &s;elf-conviction, in|&s;ulted
with reproach, denied the privilege of penitence
and contrition, cut off from all hope, impelled by indi|gence,
and maddened with de&s;pair, they had plunged into
a life of infamy, in which they were expo&s;ed to deplorable
vici&s;&s;itudes of mi&s;ery, and the mo&s;t excruciating pangs of
reflexion that any human being could &s;u&s;tain: that, what|ever
remor&s;e they might feel, how&s;oever they might dete&s;t
their own vice, or long for an opportunity of amendment,
they were entirely de&s;titute of all means of reformation:
they were not only deprived of all po&s;&s;ibility of profiting
by tho&s;e precious moments of repentance, and becoming
again u&s;eful members of &s;ociety; but, in order to earn a
mi&s;erable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, were obliged to per&s;evere in the paths
of pro&s;titution, and act as the in&s;truments of heaven's ven|geance
in propagating di&s;temper and profligacy, in ruining
the bodies and debauching the minds of their fellow-crea|tures.
Moved to &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion by the&s;e con|&s;iderations,
this virtuous bad of a&s;&s;ociates determined to
provide a comfortable a&s;ylum for female penitents, to
which they might fly for &s;helter from the receptacles of
vice, the mi&s;eries of life, and the &s;corn of mankind; where
they might indulge the &s;alutary &s;entiments of remor&s;e,
make their peace with heaven, accu&s;tom them&s;elves to in|du&s;try
and temperance, and be profitably reunited to &s;o|ciety,
from which they had been &s;o unhappily di&s;&s;evered.
The plan of this excellent in&s;titution being formed, was
put in execution by means of voluntary &s;ub&s;cription, and
the hou&s;e opened in Goodman's-&s;ields, under the name of
the Magdalen-ho&s;pital, in the month of Augu&s;t; when
fifty petitions were pre&s;ented by penitent pro&s;titutes, &s;olli|citing
admittance. Another a&s;ylum was al&s;o opened by
the hand of private charity, on the Surrey-&s;ide of We&s;tmin|&s;ter-bridge,
for the reception and education of female
orphans, and children abandoned by their parents.</P>

&sect; IV. Nor was encouragement refu&s;ed to tho&s;e who
di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by extraordinary talents in any
branch of the liberal and u&s;eful arts and &s;ciences, though
no Maecenas appeared among the mini&s;ters, and not the
lea&s;t ray of patronage glimmered from the throne. The
protection, countenance, and gratification &s;ecured in other
countries by the in&s;titution of academies, and the liberalities
of princes, the ingenious in England derived from the
genero&s;ity of a publick, endued with ta&s;te and &s;en&s;ibility,
eager for improvement, and proud of patronizing extra|ordinary
merit. Several years had already elap&s;ed
&s;ince a &s;ociety of private per&s;ons was in&s;tituted at London,
for the encouragement of arts, manufactures, and com|merce.
It con&s;i&s;ted of a pre&s;ident, vice-pre&s;ident, &s;ecre|tary,
regi&s;ter, collector, and other officers, elected from a
very con&s;iderable number of members, who pay a certain
yearly contribution for the purpo&s;es of the in&s;titution. In
the cour&s;e of every year they held eight general meetings
in a large a&s;&s;embly-room, built and furni&s;hed at the com|mon
expen&s;e; be&s;ides the ordinary meetings of the &s;ociety,
held every week, from the &s;econd Wedne&s;day in Novem|ber
to the la&s;t Wedne&s;day in May; and, in the interme|diate
time, on the fir&s;t and third Wedne&s;day of every
month. At the&s;e ordinary meetings, provided the num|ber
then pre&s;ent exceeded ten, the members had a right to
proceed on bu&s;ine&s;s, and power to appoint &s;uch committees
as they &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary. The money contributed
by this a&s;&s;ociation, after the nece&s;&s;ary expence of the &s;o|ciety
had been deducted, was expended in premiums for
planting and hu&s;bandry; for di&s;coveries and improvements
in chemi&s;try, dying, and mineralogy; for promoting the
ingenious arts of drawing, engraving, ca&s;ting, painting,
&s;tatuary, and &s;culpture; for the improvement of manu|factures
and machines in the various articles of hats,
crapes, druggets, mills, marbled-paper, &s;hip-blocks, &s;pin|ning-wheels,
toys, yarn, knitting, and weaving. They
likewi&s;e allotted &s;ums for the advantage of the Briti&s;h colo|nies
in America, and be&s;towed premiums on tho&s;e &s;ettlers
<PB N="382" REF="386">
who &s;hould excel in curing cochineal, planting logwood-trees,
cultivating olive-trees, producing myrtle-wax,
making pot-a&s;h, pre&s;erving rai&s;ins, curing &s;afflour, making
&s;ilk and wines, importing &s;turgeon, preparing i&s;ingla&s;s,
planting hemp and cinnamon, extracting opium and the
gum of the per&s;imon-tree, collecting &s;tones of the mango,
which &s;hould be found to vegetate in the We&s;t-Indies;
rai&s;ing &s;ilk-gra&s;s, and laying out provincial gardens. They,
moreover, allowed a gold medal, in honour of him who
&s;hould compo&s;e the be&s;t treati&s;e on the arts of peace, con|taining
an hi&s;torical account of the progre&s;&s;ive improve|ments
of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce in the
kingdom of England, with the effects of tho&s;e improve|ments
on the morals and manners of the people, and
pointing out the mo&s;t proper means for their future ad|vancement.
In a word, the &s;ociety is &s;o numerous, the
contributions &s;o con&s;iderable, the plan &s;o judiciou&s;ly laid,
and executed with &s;uch di&s;cretion and &s;pirit, as to promi&s;e
much more effectual and exten&s;ive advantage to the publick
than ever accrued from all the boa&s;ted academies of
Chri&s;tendom. The arti&s;ts of London had long maintain|ed
a private academy for improvement in the art of draw|ing
from living figures; but, in order to extend this ad|vantage,
which was not attained without difficulty and
expen&s;e, the Duke of Richmond, a young nobleman of the
mo&s;t amiable character, provided a large apartment at
Whitehall, for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who &s;tudied the arts of
painting, &s;culpture, and engraving; and furni&s;hed it with
a collection of original plai&s;ter ca&s;ts from the be&s;t antique
&s;tatues and bu&s;ts at Rome and Florence. Here any learner
had liberty to draw, or make models, under the eye and
in&s;tructions of two eminent arti&s;ts; and twice a year the
munificent founder be&s;towed premiums of &s;ilver medals on
the four pupils who excelled the re&s;t in drawing from a
certain figure, and making the be&s;t model of it in ba&s;&s;o|relievo<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Among other tran&s;actions that di&s;tingui&s;h the hi&s;tory of Great-Britain, &s;carce a year glides away without producing &s;ome incident that &s;trongly mark the &s;ingular character of the Engli&s;h nation.

<P>The duke, in compliance with this &s;trange remon&s;trance, ap|peared at the time and place appointed, on hor&s;eback and alone, with pi&s;tole $fore him, and the &s;tar of his order di&s;played, that he might be the more $&s;ily known. He had likewi&s;e taken the precaution of engaging a friend to $tend in the Park, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, however, as &s;carce to be ob&s;ervable. He continued &s;ome time on the &s;pot without &s;eeing any per&s;on he could &s;u&s;pect of having wrote the letter, and then rode away; but chancing to tur$ his head when he reached Hyde-Park corner, he perceived a man &s;tanding at the bridge, and looking at the water, within twenty yards of the tree which was de&s;cribed in the letter. He forthwith rode back at a gentle pace, and pa&s;&s;ing by the per&s;on expected to be addre&s;&s;ed, but as no advance of this kind was made, he, in repa&s;&s;ing, bowed to the &s;tranger, and a&s;ked if he had not &s;ome|thing to communicate.

<Q>He frequently goes to Storey's-Gate coffee-hou&s;e.&endq;</Q>
<P>In about a week after this intimation was received, the Duke &s;ent a per&s;on $o the coffee-hou&s;e, to enquire for Mr. Barnard, and tell him he would be glad to &s;peak to him. The me&s;&s;age was delivered, and Bernard declared he would wait upon his grace next Thur&s;day, at half an hour after ten in the morning. He was punctual to his appointment, and no &s;ooner appeared than the Duke recog|ni&s;ed him to be the per&s;on to whom he had &s;poke in the Park and the Abbey. Having conducted him into an apartment, and &s;hut the door, he a&s;ked, as before, $f he had any thing to communicate; and was an&s;wered, as formerly, in he negative. Then the Duke repeated every circum&s;tance of this &s;trange tran&s;|$ction; to which Barnard li&s;tened with attention and &s;urpri&s;e, yet without exhi|biting any marks of con&s;cious guilt or confu&s;ion. The Duke ob&s;erving that $t was matter of a&s;toni&s;hment to &s;ee letters of &s;uch import written with the cor|rectne&s;s of a &s;cholar, the other replied, that a man might be very poor and very earned at the &s;ame time. When he &s;aw the fourth letter, in which his name was mentioned, with the circum&s;tance of his father's ab&s;ence, he &s;aid, &startq;It $word$ very odd, my father was then out of town.&endq; An expre&s;&s;ion the more re|markable, as the letter was without date, and he could not, as an innocent man, be &s;uppo&s;ed to know at what time it was written. The Duke having made him acquainted with the particulars, told him, that if he was innocent $word$ ought to u&s;e his endeavours to detect the writer of the letters, e&s;pecially of the la&s;t, in which he was expre&s;sly named. To this admonition he returned no other an&s;wer but a &s;mile, and then withdrew. He was afterwards taken into cu&s;tody, and tried at the Old-Bailey, for &s;ending a threatening letter, con|trary to the &s;tatute; but no evidence could be found to prove the letters were of his hand writing; nor did any pre&s;umption appear again&s;t him, except his being in Hyde-Park, and in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, at the time and place ap|pointed in the two fir&s;t letters. On the other hand, Mr. Barnard proved, that on the Sunday, when he &s;aw the Duke in Hyde-Park, he was on his way to Ken&s;ington, on particular bu&s;ine&s;s, by his father's order, &s;ignified to him that very morning: that he accordingly went thither, and dined with his uncle, in company with &s;everal other per&s;ons, to whom he related what had pa&s;&s;ed between the Duke of Marlborough and him in the Park: that $word$ being afterwards in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey was the effect of mere accident$ that Mr. James Green wood, his kin&s;man, who had lain the preceding night at his father's hou&s;e, de&s;ired him to dre&s;s him&s;elf, that they might walk to|gether in the Park; and he did not comply with his reque&s;t till after much &s;ollicitation: that he propo&s;ed to enter the Park without pa&s;&s;ing through the Abbey, but was prevailed upon by Mr. Greenwood, who expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of &s;eeing the newly-erected monument of General Ha$grave: that as he had formerly communicated to his friend the &s;trange circum&s;tance of the Duke's &s;peaking to him in Hyde-Park, Mr. Greenwood no &s;ooner &s;aw that nobleman in the Abbey, than he gave notice to Mr. Bernard, who was very &s;hort-&s;ight|ed: and that, from his pa&s;&s;ing them &s;everal times, concluding he wanted to &s;peak with Mr. Barnard alone, he quitted him, and retired into the choir, that they might commune together without interruption. It likewi&s;e app$a$ed from undoubted evidence, that Barnard had often mentioned openly, to his friends and acquaintance, the circum&s;tances of what pa&s;&s;ed between him and the Duke in the Park and in the Abbey: that his father was a man of un|blemi&s;hed reputation, and in affluent circum&s;tances: that he him&s;elf was never reduced to any want, or &s;uch exigence as might impel him to any de&s;pe|rate methods of obtaining money: that his fidelity had been often tried, an his life always irreproachable. For the&s;e rea&s;ons he was acquitted of the crime laid to his charge, and the my&s;tery remains to this day undi&s;covered.</P>
<P>After all, the author of the letters does not &s;eem to have had any real de&s;$g to extort money, becau&s;e the &s;cheme was very ill calculated for that purpo&s;e and, indeed, could not po&s;&s;ibly take effect, without the mo&s;t imminent $word$ of detection. Perhaps his aim was nothing more than to gratify a petulan$ and peculiarity of humour, by alarming the Duke, exciting the curio&s;ity of $word$ publick, puzzling the multitude, and giving ri&s;e to a thou&s;and ridiculous co|jectures. If any thing more was intended, and the Duke earne&s;tly de&s;ired know the extent of the &s;cheme, he might, when he clo&s;eted the per&s;on $$$|pected, have encouraged him to a declaration, by promi&s;ing inviolable &s;ec$e on his word and honour, in which any man would have confided as a $ac$ obligation. On the whole, it is &s;urpri&s;ing that the death of the Duke, whi$$ happened in the cour&s;e of this year, was never attributed to the &s;ecret p$$|tices of this incendiary corre&s;pondent, who had given him to under&s;tand, that his vengeance, though &s;low, would not be the le&s;s certain.</P></NOTE>.</P>

&sect; V. On the twenty-third day of November both
Hou&s;es of parliament met at We&s;tmin&s;ter, when his
<PB N="384" REF="388">
Maje&s;ty being indi&s;po&s;ed, the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened by com|mi&s;&s;ion,
and the Lord-keeper harangued them to this
<PB N="385" REF="389">
effect. He told them, his Maje&s;ty had directed the lords
of the commi&s;&s;ion to a&s;&s;ure his parliament that he always
<PB N="386" REF="390">
received the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction in being able to lay before
them any events that might promote the honour and in|tere&s;t
<PB N="387" REF="391">
of his kingdoms: that, in con&s;equence of their ad|vice,
and enabled by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they unanimou&s;ly
gave, his Maje&s;ty had exerted his endeavours to carry on
the war in the mo&s;t vigorous manner, in order to attain
that de&s;ireable end, always to be wi&s;hed, a &s;afe and honour|able
peace<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the month of Augu&s;t, the King, in quality of Elector of Hanover, having occa&s;ion for two hundred thou&s;and pounds, a loan by &s;ub&s;cription for that &s;um was opened at the Bank, and filled immediately by &s;even or eight money-dealers of London.</NOTE>: that it had plea&s;ed the Divine Providence to
ble&s;s his mea&s;ures and arms with &s;ucce&s;s in &s;everal parts,
and to make the enemies of the nation feel that the &s;trength
of Great-Britain is not to be provoked with impunity:
that the conque&s;t of the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Loui&s;bourg,
with the i&s;lands of Cape-Breton and St. John; the demo|lition
of Frontenac, of the highe&s;t importance to his
operations in America, and the reduction of Senegal,
could not fail to bring great di&s;tres on the French com|merce
and colonies, and, in proportion, to procure great
advantage to tho&s;e of Great-Britain. He ob&s;erved, that
France had al&s;o been made &s;en&s;ible, that whil&s;t her forces
are &s;ent forth to invade and ravage the dominions of her
neighbours, her own coa&s;ts are not inacce&s;&s;ible to his Ma|je&s;ty's
fleets and armies: a truth which &s;he had expe|rienced
in the demolition of the works at Cherbourg,
erected at a great expence, with a particular view to an|noy
England, as well as in the lo&s;s of a great number of
&s;hips and ve&s;&s;els; but no treatment, however injurious
to his Maje&s;ty, could tempt him to make retaliation on
the innocent &s;ubjects of that crown. He told them,
that in Germany his Maje&s;ty's good brother, the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia, and Prince Ferdinand of Brun&s;wick, had found
full employment for the armies of France and her con|federates,
from which the Engli&s;h operations, both by &s;ea
and in America, had derived the mo&s;t evident advantage;
their &s;ucce&s;&s;es, owing, under God, to their able conduct,
and the bravery of his Maje&s;ty's troops, and tho&s;e of his
<PB N="388" REF="392">
allies, having been &s;ignal and glorious. The King,
moreover, commanded them to declare, that the common
cau&s;e of liberty and independency was &s;till making noble
and glorious efforts again&s;t the unnatural union formed to
oppre&s;s it: that the commerce of his &s;ubjects, the &s;ource
of national riches, had, by the vigilant protection received
from his Maje&s;ty's fleet, flouri&s;hed in a manner not to be
paralleled during &s;uch troubles. In this &s;tate of things,
he &s;aid, the King, in his wi&s;dom, thought it unnece&s;&s;ary
to u&s;e many words to per&s;uade them to bear up again&s;t
all difficulties, effectually to &s;tand by and defend his Ma|je&s;ty,
vigorou&s;ly to &s;upport the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the
re&s;t of his Maje&s;ty's allies, and to exert them&s;elves to
reduce their enemies to equitable terms of accommodation.
He ob&s;erved to the Hou&s;e of Commons, that the uncom|mon
extent of this war, in different parts, occa&s;ioned it to
be uncommonly expen&s;ive: that the King had ordered
them to declare to the Commons, that he &s;incerely la|mented,
and deeply felt for the burthens of his people: that
the &s;everal e&s;timates were ordered to be laid before them;
and that he de&s;ired only &s;uch &s;upplies as &s;hould be requi|&s;ite
to pu&s;h the war with advantage, and be adequate to the
nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervices. In the la&s;t place, he a&s;&s;ured them the
King took &s;o much &s;atisfaction in that good harmony
which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among his faithful &s;ubjects, that it was
more proper for him now to thank them for it, than to
repeat his exhortation to it: that this union, nece&s;&s;ary at
all times, was more e&s;pecially &s;o in &s;uch critical con|junctures;
and his Maje&s;ty doubted not but the good
effects the nation had found from it would be the &s;tronge&s;t
motives to them to pur&s;ue it.&mdash;The reader, will, no doubt,
be &s;urpri&s;ed to find this harangue abound with har&s;hne&s;s of
period and inelegancy of expre&s;&s;ion: he will wonder that,
in particulari&s;ing the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the year in America, no
mention is made of the reduction of Fort Du Que&s;ne on
the river Ohio; a place of great importance, both from
its &s;trength and &s;ituation, the erection of which had been
one great motive to the war between the two nations: but
<PB N="389" REF="393">
he will be &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed to hear it declared from the
throne, that the operations, both by &s;ea and in America,
had derived the mo&s;t evident advantage from the war in
Germany. An a&s;&s;ertion the more extraordinary, as the
Briti&s;h mini&s;try, in their an&s;wer to the Parallel, which we
have already mentioned, had expre&s;sly affirmed, that &startq;none
but &s;uch as are unacquainted with the maritime force of
England can believe, that without a diver&s;ion on the
continent, to employ part of the enemy's force, &s;he is not
in a condition to hope for &s;ucce&s;s, and maintain her &s;u|periority
at &s;ea.&mdash;That they mu&s;t be very ignorant, indeed,
who imagine that the forces of England are not able to
re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e of France, unle&s;s the latter be hindered from
turning all her efforts to the &s;ea.&endq; It is very remarkable,
that the Briti&s;h mini&s;try &s;hould declare that the war in
Germany was favourable to the Engli&s;h operations by &s;ea
and in America; and almo&s;t in the &s;ame breath accu&s;e
the French King of having fomented that war. Let us
&s;uppo&s;e that France had no war to maintain in Europe;
and a&s;k in what manner &s;he, in that ca&s;e, would have op|po&s;ed
the progre&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms by &s;ea, and in Ame|rica?
Her navy was reduced to &s;uch a condition that it
dur&s;t not quit her harbours; her merchant-&s;hips were all
taken, her mariners confined in England, and the &s;ea was
covered with Briti&s;h crui&s;ers: in the&s;e circum&s;tances,
what expedients could &s;he have contrived for &s;ending &s;up|plies
and re-enforcements to America, or for oppo&s;ing the
naval armaments of Great-Britain in any other part of the
world?&mdash;None. Without &s;hips and mariners, her troops,
ammunition, and &s;tores were, in this re&s;pect, as u&s;ele&s;s as
money to a man &s;hip-wrecked on a de&s;olate i&s;land. But,
granting that the war in Germany had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
diverted the attention of the French mini&s;try from the
pro&s;ecution of their operations in America (and this is
granting more than ought to be allowed) the que&s;tion is
not, whether the ho&s;tilities upon the continent of Europe
prevented France from &s;ending a great number of troops
to Canada; but whether the war in Germany was either
<PB N="390" REF="394">
nece&s;&s;ary or expedient for di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the French more ef|fectually
in other parts of the world? Surely every intelli|gent
man of candour mu&s;t an&s;wer in the negative. The
expen&s;e incurred by England for &s;ub&s;idies and armies in
the Empire exceeded three millions &s;terling annually;
and this enormous expen&s;e, without being able to protect
Hanover, only &s;erved to keep the war alive in different
parts of Germany. Had one half of this &s;um been em|ployed
in augmenting and extending the naval armaments
of Great-Britain, and in re-enforcing her troops in Ame|rica
and the We&s;t-Indies, France would have been, at this
day, deprived of all her &s;ugar colonies, as well as of her
&s;ettlements on the continent of America; and being ab|&s;olutely
cut off from the&s;e &s;ources of wealth, would have
found it impracticable either to gratify her &s;ub&s;idiaries, or
to maintain &s;uch formidable armies to annoy her neigh|bours.
The&s;e are truths, which will appear to the con|viction
of the publick, when the illu&s;ive &s;pells of un&s;ub|&s;tantial
victory are di&s;&s;olved, and time &s;hall have di&s;per&s;ed
the thick mi&s;ts of prejudice, which now &s;eem to darken
and perplex the under&s;tanding of the people.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. The conduct of the admini&s;tration was &s;o agree|able
to both Hou&s;es of parliament, that in their addre&s;s to
the throne they expre&s;&s;ed their un&s;haken zeal and loyalty
to his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on, congratulated him on the &s;ucce&s;s
of his arms, and promi&s;ed to &s;upport his mea&s;ures and
allies with &s;teadine&s;s and alacrity<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">That the charge of di&s;affection to the king's per&s;on, which was &s;o loudly trumpeted by former mini&s;ters and their adherents again&s;t all tho&s;e who had hone&s;ty and courage to oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures of a weak and corrupt admini&s;tra|tion, was entirely fal&s;e, and without foundation, appeared at this juncture when in the mid&s;t of a cruel, oppre&s;&s;ive, and continental war, maintaine by the blood and trea&s;ure of Great-Britain, all oppo&s;ition cea&s;ed in both Hou&s;e of parliament. The addre&s;&s;es of thanks to his Maje&s;ty, which are alway$ dictated by the immediate &s;ervants of the crown, were unanimou&s;ly adopte$ in both Hou&s;es, and not only couched in terms of applau&s;e, but even inflate with expre&s;&s;ions of rapture and admiration. They declared them&s;elves &s;en&s;ibl$ that the operations of Great-Britain, both by &s;ea and in America, had re|ceived the mo&s;t evident and important advantages from the maintenance the war in Germany, and &s;eemed eager to e&s;pou&s;e any mea&s;ure that $word$ gratify the inclinations of the &s;overeign.</NOTE>. It was probably in
<PB N="391" REF="395">
con&s;equence of this a&s;&s;urance that a new treaty between
Great-Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia was concluded at London on
the &s;eventh day of December, importing, That as the
burthen&s;ome war in which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia is engaged
lays him under the nece&s;&s;ity of making fre&s;h efforts to de|fend
him&s;elf again&s;t the multitude of enemies who attack
his dominions, he is obliged to take new mea&s;ures with the
King of England, for their reciprocal defence and &s;afety;
and his Britannick Maje&s;ty hath, at the &s;ame time, &s;igni|fied
his earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;trengthen the friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
between the two courts, and, in con&s;equence thereof, to
conclude a formal convention, for granting to his Pru&s;&s;ian
Maje&s;ty &s;peedy and powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance, their Maje&s;ties
have nominated and authori&s;ed their mini&s;ters to concert
and &s;ettle the following articles:&mdash;All formal treaties be|tween
the two crowns, particularly that &s;igned at We&s;t|min&s;ter
on the 16th day of January, in the year 1756,
and the convention of the 11th of April, in the year
1758, are confirmed by the pre&s;ent convention of the
11th of April, in the year 1758, in their whole tenor,
as if they were herein in&s;erted word for word. The
King of Great-Britain &s;hall cau&s;e to be paid at Lon|don,
to &s;uch per&s;on or per&s;ons as &s;hall be authori&s;ed by
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia for that end, the &s;um of four millions
of rix-dollars, making &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy thou&s;and
pounds &s;terling, at one payment, immediately on the ex|change
of the ratifications, if the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hall
&s;o require. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty &s;hall employ the &s;aid
&s;um in &s;upporting and augmenting his forces, which &s;hall
act in &s;uch manner as &s;hall be of the greate&s;t &s;ervice to the
common cau&s;e, and contribute mo&s;t to the mutual de|fence
and &s;afety of their &s;aid Maje&s;ties. The King of
Great-Britain, both as king and elector, and the King of
Pru&s;&s;ia, reciprocally bind them&s;elves not to conclude
with the powers that have taken part in the pre&s;ent war
any treaty of peace, truce, or other &s;uch like convention,
but by common advice and con&s;ent, each expre&s;sly in|cluding
therein the other. The ratification of the pre&s;ent
convention &s;hall be exchanged within &s;ix weeks, or &s;ooner,
<PB N="392" REF="396">
if po&s;&s;ible. In effect, this treaty was no other than a
renewal of the &s;ub&s;idy from year to year, becau&s;e it was
not thought proper to &s;tipulate in the fir&s;t &s;ub&s;idiary con|vention
an annual &s;upply of &s;uch importance until the
war &s;hould be terminated, left the people of England
&s;hould be alarmed at the pro&s;pect of &s;uch &s;ucce&s;&s;ive bur|thens,
and the complai&s;ance of the Commons be in &s;ome
future &s;e&s;&s;ion exhau&s;ted. On the whole, this was per|haps
the mo&s;t extraordinary treaty that ever was con|cluded;
for it contains no &s;pecification of articles, except
the payment of the &s;ub&s;idy: every other article was left
to the interpretation of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> having performed the ceremony
of addre&s;&s;es to the throne, immediately proceeded to the
great work of the &s;upply. The two committees in the
Hou&s;e of Commons were immediately e&s;tabli&s;hed, and
continued by adjournments to the month of May, by the
twenty-third day of which all their re&s;olutions were taken.
They voted &s;ixty thou&s;and men, including fourteen thou|&s;and
eight hundred and forty-five marines, for the &s;ervice
of the en&s;uing year; and for the operations by land, a
body of troops amounting to fifty-two thou&s;and five hun|dred
and fifty-three effective men, be&s;ides the auxiliaries
of Hanover, He&s;&s;e, Brun&s;wick, Saxe-Gotha, and Bucke|bourg,
to the number of fifty thou&s;and, and five battalions
on the Iri&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hment, in actual &s;ervice in America
and Africa. For the maintenance of the &s;ixty thou&s;and
men employed in the &s;ea-&s;ervice, they granted three millions
one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds; for the land|forces,
one million two hundred fifty-&s;ix thou&s;and one
hundred and thirty pounds, fifteen &s;hillings, and two-pence;
for the charge of the additional five battalions, forty
thou&s;and eight hundred and &s;eventy-nine pounds, thirteen
&s;hillings, and nine-pence; for the pay of the general and
&s;taff-officers, and ho&s;pitals of the land-forces, fifty-two
thou&s;and four hundred and eighty-four pounds, one &s;hil|ling,
and eight pence; for maintaining the garri&s;ons in
the plantations, Gibraltar, Nova-Scotia, Newfoundland,
Providence, Cape-Breton, and Senegal, the &s;um of &s;even
<PB N="393" REF="397">
hundred and forty-two thou&s;and five hundred and thirty-one
pounds, five &s;hillings, and &s;even pence; for the
charge of ordnance for land &s;ervice, two hundred and twenty
thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty-nine pounds, eleven
&s;hillings, and nine pence; for extraordinary &s;ervice per|formed
by the &s;ame office, and not provided for by parlia|ment
in the cour&s;e of the preceding year, three hundred
twenty-three thou&s;and nine hundred and eighty-&s;even
pounds, thirteen &s;hillings, and three pence; for the ordi|nary
of the navy, including half-pay to &s;ea officers, two
hundred and thirty-eight thou&s;and four hundred and
ninety-one pounds, nine &s;hillings, and eight pence; to|wards
the &s;upport of Greenwich-ho&s;pital, and for the out|pen&s;ioners
of Chel&s;ea-college, the &s;um of thirty-&s;ix thou|&s;and
pounds. They allotted for one year's expen&s;e in|curred
by the foreign troops in the pay of Great-Britain,
one million two hundred thirty-eight thou&s;and one hun|dred
and &s;eventy-&s;even pounds, nineteen &s;hillings, and
ten pence, over and above &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds for en|abling
his Maje&s;ty to fulfil his engagements with the Land|grave
of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, pur&s;uant to the &s;eparate article of
a new treaty concluded between them in the month of
January of this current year, &s;tipulating that this &s;um
&s;hould be paid to his &s;erene highne&s;s, in order to facilitate
the means by which he might again &s;ix his re&s;idence in
his own dominions, and by his pre&s;ence give fre&s;h courage
to his faithful &s;ubjects. Eighty thou&s;and pounds were
granted for enabling his Maje&s;ty to di&s;charge the like &s;um,
rai&s;ed in pur&s;uance of an act pa&s;&s;ed in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion,
and charged upon the fir&s;t aids or &s;upplies to be granted
in this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament. The &s;um of two hundred
thou&s;and pounds was voted towards the building and re|pairing
&s;hips of war for the en&s;uing year. Fifteen thou|&s;and
pounds were allowed for improving London-bridge;
and forty thou&s;and on account for the Foundling-ho&s;pital.
For the charge of tran&s;ports to be employed in the cour&s;e
of the year they a&s;&s;igned &s;ix hundred &s;ixty-&s;even thou|&s;and
&s;even hundred and twenty-one pounds, nineteen
<PB N="394" REF="398">
&s;hillings, and &s;even pence: for maintaining the colonies
of Nova-Scotia and Georgia they be&s;towed twenty-five
thou&s;and two hundred and thirty-eight pounds, thirteen
&s;hillings, and five pence. To replace &s;ums taken from
the &s;inking fund, thirty-three thou&s;and two hundred and
fifty-two pounds, eighteen &s;hillings, and ten pence half-penny;
for maintaining the Briti&s;h forts and &s;ettlements
on the coa&s;t of Africa, ten thou&s;and pounds; and for
paying off the mortgage on an e&s;tate devi&s;ed for the en|dowment
of a profe&s;&s;or&s;hip in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge,
the &s;um of twelve hundred and eighty pounds. For the
expen&s;e of the militia they voted ninety thou&s;and pounds:
for extraordinary expen&s;es relating to the land-forces, in|curred
in the cour&s;e of la&s;t year, and unprovided for by
parliament, the &s;um of four hundred &s;ixty-&s;ix thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and eighty-five pounds, ten &s;hillings, and
five-pence three farthings. For the purcha&s;e of certain
lands and hereditaments, in order to &s;ecure the King's
docks at Port&s;mouth, Chatham, and Plymouth, they
granted thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and nine hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix
pounds, two &s;hillings, and ten pence. They voted two
hundred thou&s;and pounds for enabling his Maje&s;ty to give
proper compen&s;ations to the re&s;pective provinces in North-America
for the expen&s;es they had incurred in levying
and maintaining troops for the &s;ervice of the publick.
They granted twenty thou&s;and pounds to the Ea&s;t-India
company, towards enabling them to defray the expen&s;e
of a military force in their &s;ettlements; and the &s;ame &s;um
was granted for carrying on the fortifications to &s;ecure the
harbour of Milford. To make good &s;everal &s;ums i&s;&s;ued by his
Maje&s;ty, for indemnifying the innholders and victuallers o$
Hamp&s;hire for the expen&s;es they had incurred in quartering
the He&s;&s;ian auxiliaries in England; for an addition to the &s;a|laries
of judges, and other le&s;s con&s;iderable purpo&s;es, they al|lowed
the &s;um of twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and one hundred and &s;e|venty-eight
pounds, &s;ixteen &s;hillings, and &s;ix pence. Finally
they voted one million, upon account, for enabling the King
to defray any extra ordinary expen&s;e of the war, incurred, o$
<PB N="395" REF="399">
to be incurred, for the &s;ervice of the current year; and to
take all &s;uch mea&s;ures as might be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;appoint
or defeat any enterpri&s;es or de&s;igns of his enemies, as the
exigency of affairs &s;hould require. The &s;um of all the
grants voted by the committee of &s;upply amounted to
twelve millions &s;even hundred &s;ixty-one thou&s;and three
hundred and ten pounds, nineteen &s;hillings, and five-pence.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The Commons were &s;till employed in delibera|tions
on ways and means on the twenty-&s;econd day of
May, when Mr. Secretary Pitt communicated to them a
me&s;&s;age from the King, couched in the&s;e terms: &startq;His
Maje&s;ty, relying on the experienced zeal and affection of
his faithful Commons, and con&s;idering that, in this cri|tical
conjuncture, emergencies may ari&s;e, which may be
of the utmo&s;t importance, and be attended with the mo&s;t
pernicious con&s;equences, if proper means &s;hould not im|mediately
be applied to prevent or defeat them, is de&s;i|rous
that this Hou&s;e will enable him to defray any extra|ordinary
expen&s;es of the war, incurred, or to be incurred,
for the &s;ervice of the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and fifty-nine, and to take all &s;uch mea&s;ures as may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to di&s;appoint or defeat any enterpri&s;es or de&s;igns of
his enemies, and as the exigencies of affairs may require.&endq;
This me&s;&s;age being read, a motion was made, and agreed
to <HI>nem. con.</HI> that it &s;hould be referred to the committee,
who forth with formed upon it the re&s;olution, whereby one
million was granted, to be rai&s;ed by loans or Exchequer|bills,
chargeable on the fir&s;t aids that &s;hould be given in
the next &s;e&s;&s;ion. This produced a bill enabling his Ma|je&s;ty
to rai&s;e the &s;um of one million, for the u&s;es and pur|po&s;es
therein mentioned, comprehending a clau&s;e, allow|ing
the Bank of England to advance, on the credit of the
loan therein mentioned, any &s;um not exceeding a million,
notwith&s;tanding the act of the fifth and &s;ixth years in the reign
of William and Mary, by which the Bank was e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The bills relating &s;olely to the &s;upply being di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed
and expedited, the Hou&s;e proceeded as u&s;ual to enact
other laws for the advantage of the community. Petitions
<PB N="396" REF="400">
having been pre&s;ented by the cities of Bri&s;tol and New-Sarum,
alledging, that &s;ince the laws prohibiting the
making of low wines and &s;pirits from grain, meal, and
flour had been in force, the commonalty appeared more
&s;ober, healthy, and indu&s;trious; repre&s;enting the ill con|&s;equences
which they apprehended would attend the re|peal
of the&s;e laws, and therefore praying their continu|ance;
a committee of the whole Hou&s;e re&s;olved that the
prohibition to export corn &s;hould be continued to the
twenty-fourth day of December, in the year one thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and fifty-nine; &s;ubject neverle&s;s to &s;uch
provi&s;ions for &s;hortening the &s;aid term of its continuance
as &s;hould therefore be made by any act of that &s;e&s;&s;ion, or
by his Maje&s;ty, with the advice of his privy-council, during
the rece&s;s of parliament; that the act for di&s;continuing
the duties upon corn and flour imported, or brought in as
prize, was not proper to be further continued; and that
the prohibition to make low wines or &s;pirits from any &s;ort
of grain, meal, or flour &s;hould be continued to the twenty-fourth
day of December, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and fifty-nine. Before the bill was formed on
the&s;e re&s;olutions, petitions arrived from Liverpool and
Bath, to the &s;ame purport as tho&s;e of Bri&s;tol and Sa|rum;
while, on the other hand, a remon&s;trance was
pre&s;ented by a great number of the malt-di&s;tillers of the
city and &s;uburbs of London, alledging, that it having been
deemed expedient to prohibit the di&s;tilling of &s;pirits from
any &s;ort of grain to the twenty-fourth day of December
then in&s;tant, &s;ome of the petitioners had entirely cea&s;ed
to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of di&s;tilling, while others, merely
with a view to pre&s;erve their cu&s;tomers, the compound,
di&s;tillers, and employ &s;ome of their &s;ervants, hor&s;es, and
uten&s;ils, had &s;ubmitted to carry on the di&s;tillation of &s;pirits
from mela&s;&s;es and &s;ugars under great di&s;advantages, in
full hope that the &s;aid re&s;traint would cea&s;e at the expira|tion
of the limited time, or at lea&s;t when the nece&s;&s;ity which
occa&s;ioned that re&s;traint &s;hould be removed; that it was
with great concern they ob&s;erved a bill would be brought
<PB N="397" REF="401">
$word$ for protracting the &s;aid prohibition, at a time when the
$rice of all manner of grain, and particularly of wheat and
$arley, was con&s;iderably reduced, and, as they humbly
conceived, at a rea&s;onable medium. They expatiated on
the great lo&s;s they, as well as many traders and artificers
dependents upon them, mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain, in ca&s;e the &s;aid bill
&s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed into a law. They prayed the Hou&s;e to
$ake the&s;e circum&s;tances into con&s;ideration, and either
permit them to carry on $he di&s;tillation from wheat, malt,
and other grain, under &s;uch re&s;trictions as &s;hould be
judged nece&s;&s;ary; or to grant them &s;uch other relief, in
re&s;pect of their &s;everal lo&s;&s;es and incumbrances, as to the
Hou&s;e &s;hould &s;eem rea&s;onable and expedient. This peti|tion,
though &s;trenuou&s;ly urged by a powerful and clamo|rous
body without doors, did not meet with great encou|ragement
within. It was ordered to lie upon the table,
and an in&s;truction was given to the committee, empower|ing
them to receive a clau&s;e or clau&s;es to allow the tran&s;|portation
of certain quantities of meal, flour, bread, and
bi&s;cuit to the i&s;lands of Guern&s;ey and Jer&s;ey, for the &s;ole
u&s;e of the inhabitants; and another to prohibit the mak|ing
of low wines and &s;pirits from bran. Much more at|tention
was paid to a petition of &s;everal farmers in the
county of Norfolk, repre&s;enting, that their farms con&s;i&s;ted
chiefly of arable land, which produced much greater
quantities of corn than could be con&s;umed within that
county; that in the la&s;t harve&s;t there was a great and plen|tiful
crop of all &s;orts of grain, the greate&s;t part of which
had, by unfavourable weather, been rendered unfit for &s;ale
at London, or other markets, for home con&s;umption;
that large quantities of malt were then lying at London,
ari&s;ing chiefly from the crops of barley growing in the
year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;even, the &s;ale
of which was &s;tagnated; that the petitioners being in|formed
the Hou&s;e had ordered in a bill to continue the
prohibition of corn exported, they begged leave to ob&s;erve,
that, &s;hould it pa&s;s into a law, it would be extremely pre|judicial
to all, and ruin many farmers of that county, as
<PB N="398" REF="402">
they had offered their corn for &s;ale at divers ports and
markets of the &s;aid county; but the merchants refu&s;ed to
buy it at any price, alledging its being unfit for the Lon|don
market, the great quantity of corn with which that
market was already over&s;tocked, and their not being al|lowed
either to export it, or make it into malt for expor|tation:
they, therefore, prayed this prohibition might be
removed, or they the petitioners indulged with &s;ome other
kind of relief. Although this remon&s;trance was duely
con&s;idered, the bill pa&s;&s;ed with the amendments, becau&s;e
of the provi&s;o, by which his Maje&s;ty in council was em|powered
to &s;horten the date of the prohibition, with re|&s;pect
to the exportation of corn during the rece&s;s of par|liament:
but the temporary re&s;traint laid upon di&s;tillation
was made ab&s;olute, without any &s;uch condition, to the no
&s;mall di&s;appointment and mortification of the di&s;tillers, who
had &s;pared no pains or expen&s;e, by private &s;ollicitation and
&s;trenuous di&s;pute in the publick papers, to recommend
their cau&s;e to the favour of the community. They urged,
that malt &s;pirits, when u&s;ed in moderation, far from being
prejudicial to the health of individuals, were in many damp
and mar&s;hy parts of the kingdom ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for
pre&s;erving the field-labourers from agues, and other di|&s;tempers
produced by the cold and moi&s;ture of the cli|mate;
that if they were debarred the u&s;e of malt-&s;pirits
they would have recour&s;e to French brandy, with which,
as they generally re&s;ided near the &s;ea coa&s;t, the &s;mugglers
would provide them almo&s;t as cheap as the malt-&s;pirits,
could be afforded; thus the increa&s;ed con&s;umption of
French &s;pirit would drain the nation of ready money to a
con&s;iderable amount, and prejudice the King's revenue in
the &s;ame proportion. They ob&s;erved, that many di&s;tillers
had already quitted that branch of trade, and di&s;po&s;ed of
their materials; that all of them would probably take the
&s;ame re&s;olution, &s;hould the bill pa&s;s into a law, as no man
could for&s;ee when the prohibition would cea&s;e, &s;hould it
be continued at a time when all &s;orts of grain abounded
in &s;uch plenty: that the very wa&s;te of materials by di&s;u&s;e,
<PB N="399" REF="403">
over and above the lying out of the money, would be of great
prejudice to the proprietor: thus the bu&s;ine&s;s of di&s;tilling,
by which &s;o many families were &s;upported, would be ba|ni&s;hed
from the kingdom entirely: e&s;pecially, as the ex|pen&s;e
of e&s;tabli&s;hing a large di&s;tillery was &s;o great, that
no man would choo&s;e to employ his money for this pur|po&s;e,
judging from experience, that &s;ome future accidental
&s;carcity of corn might induce the legi&s;lature to interpo&s;e
a ruinous delay in this branch of bu&s;ine&s;s. They affirmed,
that, from the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of malt-&s;pirits, no good argu|ment
could be drawn again&s;t this branch of traffick, no
more than again&s;t any other conveniency of life: that
the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of common beer or ale was prejudicial to
the health and morals of the people, yet no per&s;on ever
thought of putting an end to the practice of brewing, in
order to prevent the abu&s;e of brewedliquors. They urged,
that in all parts of Great-Britain there are &s;ome parcels
of land that produce nothing to advantage, but a coar&s;e
kind of barley, called big, which, though neither fit for
brewing or for baking, may neverthele&s;s be u&s;ed in the
di&s;tillery, and is accordingly purcha&s;ed by tho&s;e concerned
in this branch at &s;uch an encouraging price as enables
many farmers to pay a higher rent to their landlords than
they could otherwi&s;e afford: that there are every year
&s;ome parcels of all &s;orts of grain &s;o damaged by un|&s;ea&s;onable
weather, or other accidents, as to be
rendered altogether unfit for bread or brewery, and
would prove a very great misfortune to the farmer,
if there was no di&s;tillery, for the u&s;e of which
he could &s;ell his damaged commodity. They a&s;&s;erted,
that malt-&s;pirits were ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for pro&s;e|cuting
&s;ome branches of foreign commerce, particu|larly
the trade to the coa&s;t of Africa, for which traffick
no a&s;&s;ortment could be made up without a large quantity
of geneva, of which the natives are &s;o fond, that they will
not traffick with any merchant who has not a con&s;iderable
quantity, not only for &s;ale, but al&s;o for pre&s;ents to their
chiefs and rulers: that the merchants of Great-Britain
<PB N="400" REF="404">
mu&s;t either have this commodity of their own produce,
or import it at a great national expen&s;e from Holland:
that the charge of this importation, together with the
duties payable upon it, &s;ome part of which is not to be
drawn back on exportation, will render it impo&s;&s;ible for
the traders to &s;ell it &s;o cheap on the coa&s;t of Africa as it
might be &s;old by the Dutch, who are the great rivals of
Great-Britain in this branch of commerce. To the&s;e ar|guments,
all of which were plau&s;ible, and &s;ome of them
unan&s;werable, it was replied, that malt-&s;pirits might
be con&s;idered as a fatal and bewitching poi&s;on, which had
actually debauched the minds and enervated the bodies
of the common people to a very deplorable degree; that,
without entering further into a compari&s;on between the
u&s;e and abu&s;e of the two liquors, beer and geneva, it
would be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the u&s;e of beer and ale
had produced none of tho&s;e dreadful effects which were
the con&s;equences of drinking geneva; and &s;ince the pro|hibition
of the di&s;tillery of malt-&s;pirits had taken place,
the common people were become apparently more &s;ober,
decent, healthy, and indu&s;trious: a circum&s;tance &s;ufficient
to induce the legi&s;lature not only to intermit, but even
totally to aboli&s;h the practice of di&s;tillation, which has
ever been productive of &s;uch intoxication, riot, di&s;order,
and di&s;temper, among the lower cla&s;s of the people, as
might be deemed the greate&s;t evils incident to a well regu|lated
commonwealth. Their a&s;&s;ertion with re&s;pect to the
coar&s;e kind of barley, called big, was contradicted as a
deviation from truth, ina&s;much as it was u&s;ed in making
malt, as well as in making bread: and with re&s;pect to
damaged corn, tho&s;e who under&s;tood the nature of grain
affirmed, that if it was &s;poiled to &s;uch a degree as to be
altogether unfit for either of the&s;e purpo&s;es, the di&s;tillers
would not purcha&s;e it at &s;uch a price as would indemnify
the farmer for the charge of thre&s;hing and carriage; for
the di&s;tillers are very &s;en&s;ible that their greate&s;t profit is
derived from their di&s;tilling the malt made from the be&s;t
barley, &s;o that the increa&s;e of the produce far exceeded
<PB N="401" REF="405">
in proportion the advance of the price. It was not, how|ever,
an ea&s;y matter to prove that the di&s;tillation of malt-&s;pirits
was not nece&s;&s;ary to an advantageous pro&s;ecution of
the commerce on the coa&s;t of Guinea, as well as among the
Indians in &s;ome parts of North-America. Certain it is,
that in the&s;e branches of traffick the want of Geneva may
be &s;upplied with &s;pirits di&s;tilled from &s;ugars and mela&s;&s;es.
After all, it mu&s;t be owned, that the good and &s;alutary
effects of the prohibition were vi&s;ible in every part of the
kingdom, and no evil con&s;equences en&s;ued, except a di|minution
of the revenue in this article: a con&s;ideration
which, at all times, ought to be &s;acrificed to the health
and morals of the people: nor will this con&s;ideration be
found of any great weight, when we reflect that the le&s;s
the malt-&s;pirit is drunk, the greater quantity of beer and
ale will be con&s;umed, and the produce of the duties and
exci&s;e upon the brewery be augmented accordingly.</P>
<P>&sect; X. In the mean time, all &s;orts of grain continuing
to fall in price, and great plenty appearing in every part of
the kingdom, the ju&s;tices of the peace, and of the grand
juries a&s;&s;embled at the general quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions of the peace
held for the county of Norfolk, compo&s;ed and pre&s;ented
to the Hou&s;e of Commons, in the beginning of February,
a petition, repre&s;enting, that the weather proving unfa|vourable
in the harve&s;t, great part of the barley rai&s;ed in
that county was much damaged, and rendered unfit for
any other u&s;e than that of being made into malt for
exportation; that, unle&s;s it &s;hould be &s;peedily manu|factured
for that purpo&s;e, it would be entirely &s;poiled, and
peri&s;h in the hands of the growers; a lo&s;s that mu&s;t be
very &s;en&s;ibly felt by the land-owners: they, therefore, en|treated
that leave might be given for the exportation of
$malt; and that they might be favoured with &s;uch further
relief, as to the Hou&s;e &s;hould &s;eem ju&s;t and rea&s;onable.
In con&s;equence of this petition, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved it&s;elf
$nto a committee, to deliberate upon the &s;ubject; and as
$t appeared, upon examination, that the price of grain
was reduced very low, and great abundance diffu&s;ed through
<PB N="402" REF="406">
the kingdom, they re&s;olved, that the continuance of that
part of the act, prohibiting the exportation of grain,
ought to be abridged and &s;hortened, and the exportation
of the&s;e commodities allowed, under proper regulations
with re&s;pect to the time of &s;uch exportation, and the
allowance of bounties thereupon. A bill being founded
on the&s;e re&s;olutions, was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and underwent &s;everal
amendments: at length, it was &s;ent with a new title to
the Lords, who pa&s;&s;ed it without further alteration, and
then it obtained the royal &s;anction.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. While this affair was under the deliberation of
the committee, the Commons unanimou&s;ly i&s;&s;ued an order
for leave to bring in a bill to continue, for a limited time,
the act of la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, permitting the importation of salted
beef from Ireland into Great Britain, with an in&s;truction
to receive a claue extending this permi&s;&s;ion to all &s;orts of
&s;alted pork, or hog meat, as the officers of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e
had refu&s;ed to admit hams from Ireland to an entry.
The bill likewi&s;e received another con&s;iderable alteration,
importing, That, in&s;tead of the duty of one &s;hilling and
three pence, charged by the former act on every hundred
weight of &s;lated beef or pork imported from Ireland, which
was found not adequate to the duty payable for &s;uch a
quantity of &s;alt as is requi&s;ite to be u&s;ed in curing and
&s;alting thereof; and to prevent as well the expen&s;e to the
revenue, as the detriment and lo&s;s which would accrue $word$
the owner and importer, from opening the ca&s;ks in whic$
the provi&s;ion is generally depo&s;ited, with the pickle $word$
brine proper for pre&s;erving the &s;ame, in order to a&s;cert$i$
the net weight of the provi&s;ion liable to the &s;aid duties&mdash;
for the&s;e rea&s;ons it was enacted, That from and after th$
twenty-fourth day of la&s;t December, and during the con|tinuance
of this act, a duty of three &s;hillings and four
pence &s;hould be paid upon importation for every barrel $word$
ca&s;k of &s;alted beef or pork containing thirty-two gallons
and one &s;hilling and three-pence for every hundred weigh$
of &s;alted beef, called dried beef, dried neats tongues, $word$
<PB N="403" REF="407">
dried hog-meat, and &s;o in proportion for any greater or
le&s;&s;er quantity.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. Repeated complaints having been made to the
government by neutral nations, e&s;pecially the Dutch, that
their &s;hips had been plundered, and their crews maltreated,
by &s;ome of the Engli&s;h privateers, the legi&s;lature re&s;olved
to provide effectually again&s;t any &s;uch outrageous practices
for the future: and with this view the Commons ordered a
bill to be brought in, for amending and explaining an act
of the twenty-ninth year of his late Maje&s;ty's reign, inti|tuled,
&startq;An act for the encouragement of &s;eamen, and
more &s;peedy and effectual manning of his Maje&s;ty's
navy.&endq; While the committee was employed in pe|ru&s;ing
commi&s;&s;ions and papers relating to private &s;hips of
war, that they might be fully acquainted with the nature
of the &s;ubject, a con&s;iderable number of merchants and
others, inhabiting the i&s;lands of Guern&s;ey and Jer&s;ey, pre|&s;ented
a petition to the Hou&s;e, alledging, that the inha|bitants
of tho&s;e i&s;lands, which lie in the Briti&s;h channel,
within &s;ight of the French coa&s;t, had now, as well as in
former wars, embarked their fortunes in equipping &s;mall
privateers, which u&s;ed to run in clo&s;e with the French
&s;hore, and being di&s;gui&s;ed like fi&s;hing-boats, had not only
taken a con&s;iderable number of prizes, to the great an|noyance
of the enemy, but al&s;o obtained material intelli|gence
of their de&s;igns, on many important occa&s;ions;
that the&s;e &s;ervices could not be performed by large ve&s;&s;els,
which dur&s;t not approach &s;o near the coa&s;t, and indeed
could not appear without giving the alarm, which was
communicated from place to place by appointed &s;ignals.
Being informed that a bill was depending, in order to pro|hibit
privateers of &s;mall burthen, they declared that &s;uch
a law, if extended to privateers equipped in tho&s;e i&s;lands,
would ruin &s;uch as had inve&s;ted their fortunes in &s;mall
privateers; and not only deprive the kingdom of the before|mentioned
advantages, but expo&s;e Great-Britain to infinite
prejudice from the &s;mall armed ve&s;&s;els of France, which
the enemy in that ca&s;e would pour abroad over the whole
<PB N="404" REF="408">
Channel, to the great annoyance of navigation and com|merce.
They prayed, therefore, that &s;uch privateers as
belonged to the i&s;lands of Guern&s;ey and Jer&s;ey might be
wholly excepted from the penalties contained in the bill,
or that they (the petitioners) might be heard by their
coun&s;el, and be indulged with &s;uch relief as the Hou&s;e
&s;hould judge expedient. This repre&s;entation being re|ferred
to the con&s;ideration of the committee, produced
divers amendments to the bill, which, at length, obtained
the royal a&s;&s;ent, and contained the&s;e regulations: That,
after the fir&s;t day of January in the pre&s;ent year, no com|mi&s;&s;ion
&s;hould be granted to a privateer in Europe under
the burthen of one hundred tons, the force of ten carriage
guns, being three-pounders or above, with forty men at
the lea&s;t, unle&s;s the lords of the Admiralty, or per&s;ons au|thori&s;ed
by them, &s;hould think fit to grant the &s;ame to
any &s;hip of inferior force or burthen, the owners thereof
giving &s;uch bail or &s;ecurity as &s;hould be pre&s;cribed: that
the lords of the Admiralty might at any time revoke, by
an order in writing under their hands, any commi&s;&s;ion
granted to a privateer; this revocation being &s;ubject to an
appeal to his Maje&s;ty in council, who&s;e determination
&s;hould be final: that, previous to the granting any com|mi&s;&s;ion,
the per&s;ons propo&s;ing to be bound, and give &s;e|curity,
&s;hould &s;everally make oath of their being re&s;pec|tively
worth more money than the &s;um for which they
were then to be bound, over and above the payment of all
their ju&s;t debts: that per&s;ons applying for &s;uch commi&s;&s;ions
&s;hould make application in writing, and therein $et forth
a particular and exact de&s;cription of the ve&s;&s;el, &s;pecifying
the burthen, and the number and nature of the guns $word$
board, to what place belonging, as well as the name $word$
names of the principal owner or owners, and the numbe$
of men: the&s;e particulars to be in&s;erted in the commi&s;&s;ion
and every commander to produce &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion to th$
Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer who &s;hould examine the ve&s;&s;el, and
finding her an&s;wer the de&s;cription, give a certificate there$$
gratis, to be deemed a nece&s;&s;ary clearance, without whic$
<PB N="405" REF="409">
the commander &s;hould not depart: that if, after the fir&s;t
day of June, any captain of a privateer &s;hould agree for
the ran&s;om of any neutral ve&s;&s;el, or the cargo, or any part
thereof, after it &s;hould have been taken as prize, and in
pur&s;uance of &s;uch agreement &s;hould actually di&s;charge &s;uch
prize, he &s;hould be deemed guilty of piracy; but that
with re&s;pect to contraband merchandi&s;e, he might take it
on board his own &s;hip, with the con&s;ent of the commander
of the neutral ve&s;&s;el, and then &s;et her at liberty; and that
no per&s;on &s;hould purloin or embezzle the &s;aid merchandi&s;e
before condemnation: that no judge, or other per&s;on be|longing
to any court of Admiralty, &s;hould be concerned
in any privateer: that owners of ve&s;&s;els, not being under
fifty, or above one hundred tons, who&s;e commi&s;&s;ions are
declared void, &s;hould be indemnified for their lo&s;s by the
publick: that a court of oyer and terminer, and jail deli|very,
for the tryal of offences committed within the juri&s;|diction
of the Admiralty, &s;hould be held twice a-year in
the Old Bailey, at London, or in &s;uch other place within
England as the board of Admiralty &s;hould appoint: that
the judge of any court of Admiralty, after an appeal inter|po&s;ed,
as well as before, &s;hould, at the reque&s;t of the
captor or claimant, i&s;&s;ue an order for apprai&s;ing the cap|ture,
when the parties do not agree upon the value, and
an inventory to be taken; then exact &s;ecurity for the full
value, and cau&s;e the capture to be delivered to the per&s;on
giving &s;uch &s;ecurity; but, &s;hould objection be made to the
taking &s;uch &s;ecurity, the judge &s;hould, at the reque&s;t of
either party, order &s;uch merchandi&s;e to be entered, landed,
and &s;old at publick auction, and the produce be depo&s;ited
at the Bank, or in &s;ome publick &s;ecurities; and in ca&s;e of
&s;ecurity being given, the judge &s;hould grant a pa&s;s in fa|vour
of the capture. Finally, the force of this act was
limited to the duration of the then war with France only.
This regulation very clearly demon&s;trated, that whatever
violences might have been committed on the &s;hips of neu|tral
nations, they were by no means countenanced by the
legi&s;lature, or the body of the people.</P>

&sect; XIII. Every circum&s;tance relating to the information
of the marine mu&s;t be an important object to a nation
who&s;e wealth and power depend upon navigation and com|merce:
but a con&s;ideration of equal weight was the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of the militia, which, notwith&s;tanding the re|peated
endeavours of the parliament, was found &s;till in|complete,
and in want of further a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the legi|&s;lature.
His Maje&s;ty having, by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, recommended to the Hou&s;e the making &s;uit|able
provi&s;ion for defraying the charges of the militia dur|ing
the current year, the accounts of the expen&s;e already
incurred by this e&s;tabli&s;hment were referred to the com|mittee
of &s;upply, who, after having duely peru&s;ed them,
re&s;olved, that ninety thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be granted
on account, towards defraying the charges of pay and
clothing for the militia, from the la&s;t day of the la&s;t year
to the twenty-fifth day of March in the year one thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and &s;ixty, and for repaying a &s;um advanced
by the King for this &s;ervice. Leave was given to bring
in one bill pur&s;uant to this re&s;olution, and another to en|force
the execution of the laws relating to the militia, re|move
certain difficulties, and prevent the inconvenien|cies
by which it might be attended. So intent were the
majority on both &s;ides upon this national mea&s;ure, that they
not only carried both bills to the throne, where they re|ceived
the royal a&s;&s;ent; but they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to
the King, de&s;iring his Maje&s;ty would give directions to his
lieutenants of the &s;everal counties, ridings, and places in
England, to u&s;e their utmo&s;t diligence and attention for
carrying into execution the &s;everal acts of parliament re|lating
to the militia. By this time all the individuals that
con&s;tituted the repre&s;entatives of the people, except &s;uch as
actually &s;erved in the army, were become very well di&s;|po&s;ed
towards this in&s;titution. Tho&s;e who really wi&s;hed
well to their country had always exerted them&s;elves in its
favour: and it was now likewi&s;e e&s;pou&s;ed by tho&s;e who
fore&s;aw that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a national militia would
enable the admini&s;tration to &s;end the greater number of
<PB N="407" REF="411">
regular troops to fight the battles of Germany. Yet how
zealous &s;oever the legi&s;lature might be in promoting this
in&s;titution, and notwith&s;tanding the &s;ucce&s;s with which
many patriots exerted their endeavours through different
parts of the kingdom in rai&s;ing and di&s;ciplining the mili|tia,
it was found not only difficult, but almo&s;t impractica|ble
to execute the intention of the parliament in &s;ome par|ticular
counties, where the gentlemen were indolent and
enervated, or in tho&s;e places where they looked upon their
commander with contempt. Even Middle&s;ex it&s;elf,
where the King re&s;ides, was one of the la&s;t counties in
which the militia could be arrayed. In allu&s;ion to this
backwardne&s;s, the preamble or fir&s;t clau&s;e in one of the
pre&s;ent acts imported, that certain counties, ridings, and
places in England had made &s;ome progre&s;s in e&s;tabli&s;hing
the militia, without completing the &s;ame, and that in
certain other counties little progre&s;s had been made therein,
his Maje&s;ty's lieutenants and the deputy lieutenants, and
all others within &s;uch counties or di&s;tricts, were therefore
&s;trictly required &s;peedily and diligently to put the&s;e acts in
execution. The truth is, &s;ome of the&s;e unwarlike com|manders
failed through ignorance and inactivity; others
gave or offered commi&s;&s;ions to &s;uch people as threw a ridi|cule
and contempt upon the whole e&s;tabli&s;hment, and
con&s;equently hindered many gentlemen of worth, &s;pirit,
and capacity from engaging in the &s;ervice. The mutiny-bill,
and that for the regulation of the marine-forces while
on &s;hore, pa&s;&s;ed through the u&s;ual forms, as annual mea|&s;ures,
without any di&s;pute or alteration<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The next bill that $ell under the cognizance of the Hou&s;e related to a law tran&s;action, and was &s;ugge&s;ted by a petition pre&s;ented in the name of the &s;heriffs, and grantees of po&s;t-$ines under the crown of England. They enu|merated and explained the difficulties under which they laboured, in rai&s;ing and collecting the&s;e $ines within the re&s;pective countries; particularly when the e&s;tate conveyed by $ine was no more than a right of rever&s;ion, in which ca&s;e they could not po&s;&s;ibly levy the po&s;t-$ine, unle&s;s the purcha&s;er &s;hould obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion within the term of the &s;heriffalty, or pay it of his own free will, as they could not di&s;train while the lands were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the do$$e. They, therefore, propo&s;ed a method for rai&s;ing the&s;e po&s;t-$ines by a proper officer, to be appointed for that purpo&s;e; and prayed that leave might be given to bring in a bill accordingly. This petition was &s;econded by a me&s;&s;age from the King, importing, that his Maje&s;ty, as far as his In|tere&s;t was concerned, gave his con&s;ent that the Hou&s;e might act in thi$ affair as they &s;hould think proper.</P>
<P>The Commons, in a committee of the whole Hou&s;e, having taken into con|&s;ideration the merits of the petition, formed &s;everal re&s;olutions; upon which a bill was founded for the more regular and ea&s;y collecting, accounting for, and paying of po&s;t-$ines, which &s;hould be due to the crown, or to the grantees thereof under the crown, and for the ca&s;e of &s;heriffs in re&s;pect to the &s;ame. Before it pa&s;&s;ed into a law, however, it was oppo&s;ed by a petition in favour $word$ one William Daw, a lunatick, clerk of the King's &s;ilver office, alledging, that &s;hould the bill pa&s;s, it would deprive the &s;aid Daw and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of an ancient fee belonging to his office, on &s;earches made for po&s;t-fines by the under-&s;heriffs of the &s;everal counties; therefore, praying that &s;uch provi&s;ion might be made for the &s;aid lunatick as to the Hou&s;e &s;hould &s;eem ju&s;t and rea&s;onable. This, and divers other petitions re&s;pecting the bill, being di$|cu&s;&s;ed in the committee, it underwent &s;everal amendments, and was enacted into a law; the particulars of which cannot be properly under&s;tood without a previous explanation of this method of conveying e&s;tates: a &s;ubject ob&s;cure in it&s;elf, founded upon a &s;eeming &s;ubterfuge of law, &s;carce reconcileable with the dictates of common &s;en&s;e, and con&s;equently improper for the pe$ of $span$.</P></NOTE>.</P>

&sect; XIV. A committee having been appointed to enquire
what laws were expired, or near expiring, and to report
their opinion to the Hou&s;e touching the revival or conti|nuation
of the&s;e laws, they agreed to &s;everal re&s;olutions;
in con&s;equence of which the following bills were brought
in, and enacted into laws; namely, an act for regulating
the la&s;tage and balla&s;tage of the river Thames; an act fo$
continuing the law relating to the puni&s;hment of per&s;ons
going armed or di&s;gui&s;ed; an act for continuing &s;everal
laws near expiring; an act concerning the admea&s;ure|ment
of coals; and an act for the relief of debtors, with
re&s;pect to the impri&s;onment of their per&s;ons. This la&s;t
was almo&s;t totally metamorpho&s;ed by alterations, amend|ments,
and additions, among which the mo&s;t remarkable
were the&s;e: that where more creditors than one &s;hall
charge any pri&s;oner in execution, and de&s;ire to have him
detained in pri&s;on, they &s;hall only re&s;pectively pay him
each &s;uch weekly &s;um, not exceeding one &s;hilling and
&s;ix-pence per week, as the court, at the time of his being
remanded, &s;hall direct: that if any pri&s;oner, de&s;cribed by
<PB N="409" REF="413">
the act, &s;hall remain in pri&s;on three months after being
committed, any creditor may compel him to give into
court, upon oath, an account of his real and per&s;onal
e&s;tate, to be di&s;po&s;ed of for the benefit of his creditors,
they con&s;enting to his being di&s;charged. Why the hu|manity
of this law was confined to tho&s;e pri&s;oners only
who are not charged in execution with any debt exceed|ing
one hundred pounds cannot ea&s;ily be conceived. A
man, who, through unavoidable misfortunes, hath &s;unk
from affluence to mi&s;ery and indigence, is generally a
greater object of compa&s;&s;ion than he who never knew the
delicacies of life, nor ever enjoyed credit &s;ufficient to con|tract
debts to any con&s;iderable amount: yet the latter
is by this law entitled to his di&s;charge, or at lea&s;t to a
maintenance in pri&s;on; while the former is left to &s;tarve
in gaol, or undergo perpetual impri&s;onment, amid&s;t all the
horrors of mi&s;ery, if he owes above one hundred pounds
to a revengeful and unrelenting creditor. Wherefore,
in a country, the people of which ju&s;tly pique them&s;elves
upon charity and benevolence, an unhappy fellow-citizen,
reduced to a &s;tate of bankruptcy by unfor&s;een lo&s;&s;es in trade,
&s;hould be &s;ubjected to a puni&s;hment, which, of all others,
mu&s;t be the mo&s;t grievous to a free-born Briton, namely,
the entire lo&s;s of liberty; a puni&s;hment which the mo&s;t
flagrant crime can hardly de&s;erve, in a nation that di&s;claims
the torture; for, doubtle&s;s, perpetual impri&s;onment mu&s;t
be a torture infinitely more &s;evere than death, becau&s;e
protracted through a &s;eries of years &s;pent in mi&s;ery and
de&s;pair, without one glimmering ray of hope, without the
mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of deliverance? Wherefore the legi|&s;lature
&s;hould extend its humanity to tho&s;e only who are
the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the benefit, becau&s;e the mo&s;t able to
&s;truggle under misfortune; and wherefore many valua|ble
individuals &s;hould, for no guilt of their own, be not
only ruined to them&s;elves, but lo&s;t to the community?
are que&s;tions which we cannot re&s;olve to the &s;atisfaction
of the reader. Of all impri&s;oned debtors, tho&s;e who are
con&s;ined for large &s;ums may be deemed the mo&s;t wretched
<PB N="410" REF="414">
and forlorn, becau&s;e they have generally fallen from a
&s;phere of life where they had little acquaintance with
nece&s;&s;ity, and were altogether ignorant of the arts by which
the &s;everities of indigence are alleviated. On the other
hand, tho&s;e of the lower cla&s;s of mankind, who&s;e debts
are &s;mall in proportion to the narrowne&s;s of their former
credit, have not the &s;ame delicate feelings of calamity.
They are inured to hard&s;hip, and accu&s;tomed to the la|bour
of their hands, by which, even in a pri&s;on, they can
earn a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Their rever&s;e of fortune is not &s;o
great, nor the tran&s;ition &s;o affecting. Their &s;en&s;ations are
not delicate; nor are they, like their betters in mi|&s;fortune,
cut off from hope, which is the wretch's la&s;t com|fort.
It is the man of &s;entiment and &s;en&s;ibility who, in
this &s;ituation, is overwhelmed with a complication of mi&s;e|ry
and ineffable di&s;tre&s;s. The mortification of his pride,
his ambition bla&s;ted, his family undone, him&s;elf deprived
of liberty, reduced from opulence to extreme want, from
the elegancies of life to the mo&s;t &s;qualid and frightful
&s;cenes of poverty and affliction; dive&s;ted of comfort,
de&s;titute of hope, and doomed to linger out a wretched
being in the mid&s;t of in&s;ult, violence, riot, and uproar:
the&s;e are reflections &s;o replete with horror, as to render
him, in all re&s;pects, the mo&s;t mi&s;erable object on the face
of the earth. He, alas! though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of talents that
might have e&s;&s;entially &s;erved, and even adorned &s;ociety,
while thus re&s;trained in pri&s;on, and affected in mind, can
exert no faculty, nor &s;toop to any conde&s;cen&s;ion, by
which the horrors of his fate might be a&s;&s;uaged. He
&s;corns to execute the lowe&s;t offices of menial &s;ervices, par|ticularly
in attending tho&s;e who are the objects of con|tempt
or abhorrence: he is incapable of exerci&s;ing any
mechanick art, which might afford a happy though a
&s;canty independence. Shrunk within his di&s;mal cell,
&s;urrounded by haggard poverty, and her gaunt attend|ants,
hollow-eyed famine, &s;hivering cold, and wan di&s;|$a&s;e,
he wildly ca&s;ts his eyes around: he &s;ees the tender
partner of his heart weeping in &s;ilent woe: he hears his
<PB N="411" REF="415">
helple&s;s babes clamorous for &s;u&s;tenance; he feels him&s;elf
the importunate cravings of human nature, which he
cannot &s;atisfy; and groans with all the complicated pangs
of internal angui&s;h, horrour, and de&s;pair. The&s;e are not
the fictions of idle fancy, but real pictures, drawn from
nature, of which almo&s;t every pri&s;on in England will af|ford
but too many originals.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. Among other new mea&s;ures, a &s;ucce&s;sful at|tempt
was made in favour of Ireland, by a bill, permitting
the free importation of cattle from that kingdom for a
limited time. This, however, was not carried through
both Hou&s;es without con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition, ari&s;ing from
the particular intere&s;t of certain counties and di&s;tricts in
&s;everal parts of Great-Britain, from whence petitions
again&s;t the bill were tran&s;mitted to the Commons. Divers
artifices were al&s;o u&s;ed within doors to &s;addle the bill with
&s;uch clau&s;es as might overcharge the &s;cheme, and render
it odious or alarming to the publick: but the promoters
of it being aware of the de&s;ign, conducted it in &s;uch a
manner as to fru&s;trate all their views, and convey it &s;afely
to the throne, where it was enacted into a law. The like
&s;ucce&s;s attended another effort in behalf of our fellow-&s;ubjects
of Ireland. The bill for the importation of Iri&s;h
cattle was no &s;ooner ordered to be brought in, than the
Hou&s;e proceeded to take into con&s;ideration the duties then
payable on the importation of tallow from the &s;ame king|dom,
and &s;everal witne&s;&s;es being examined, the committee
agreed to a re&s;olution that the&s;e duties &s;hould cea&s;e and
determine for a limited time. A bill being formed ac|cordingly,
pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es without oppo&s;ition;
though in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion a bill to the &s;ame purpo&s;e
had mi&s;carried among the peers: a mi&s;carriage probably
owing to their being unacquainted with the &s;entiments of
his Maje&s;ty, as &s;ome of the duties upon tallow con&s;tituted
part of one of the branches appropriated for the civil li&s;t
revenue. This objection, however, was obviated in the
ca&s;e of the pre&s;ent bill, by the King's me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e
of Commons, &s;ignifying his Maje&s;ty's con&s;ent, as far as
<PB N="412" REF="416">
his intere&s;t was concerned in the affair. By this new act
the free importation of Iri&s;h tallow was permitted for
the term of five years.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. In the month of February the Commons pre|&s;ented
an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, reque&s;ting that he would
give directions for laying before the Hou&s;e an account
of what had been done, &s;ince the beginning of la&s;t year,
towards &s;ecuring the harbour of Milford, in pur&s;uance of
any directions from his Maje&s;ty. The&s;e accounts being
peru&s;ed, and the King having, by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, exhorted them to make provi&s;ion for fortifying
the &s;aid harbour, a bill was brought in, to explain, amend,
and render more effectual, the act of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion relating
to this &s;ubject and, pa&s;&s;ing through both Hou&s;es, received
the royal a&s;&s;ent without oppo&s;ition. By this act &s;everal
engineers were added to the commi&s;&s;ioners formerly ap|pointed;
and it was ordained that fortifications &s;hould be
erected at Peter-church-point, We&s;tlanyon-point, and
Neyland-point, as being the mo&s;t proper and be&s;t &s;ituated
places for fortifying the interior parts of the harbour. It
was al&s;o enacted that the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould appoint
proper &s;ecretaries, clerks, a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and other officers, for
carrying the two acts into execution; and that an account
of the application of the money &s;hould be laid before
parliament, within twenty days of the opening of every
&s;e&s;&s;ion. What next attracted the attention of the Hou&s;e
was an affair of the utmo&s;t importance to the commerce
of the kingdom, which equally affected the intere&s;t of the
nation, and the character of the natives. In the latter end
of February complaint was made to the Hou&s;e, that, &s;ince
the commencement of the war, an infamous traffick had
been &s;et on foot by &s;ome merchants of London, of import|ing
French cloths into &s;everal ports of the Levant, on
account of Briti&s;h Subjects. Five per&s;ons were &s;um|moned
to attend the Hou&s;e, and the fact was fully proved,
not only by their evidence, but al&s;o by &s;ome papers &s;ub|mitted
to the Hou&s;e by the Turkey company. A bill was
immediately contrived for putting a &s;top to this &s;candalous
<PB N="413" REF="417">
practice, reciting in the preamble, that &s;uch traffick was
not only a manife&s;t di&s;couragement and prejudice to the
woolen manufactures of Great-Britain, but al&s;o a relief
to the enemy, in con&s;equence of which they were enabled
to maintain the war again&s;t the&s;e kingdoms.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The next object that employed the attention
of the Commons was to explain and amend a law made
in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion for granting to his Maje&s;ty &s;everal rates
and duties upon offices and pen&s;ions. The directions
&s;pecified in the former act for levying this impo&s;ition hav|ing
been found inconvenient in many re&s;pects, new regula|tions
were now e&s;tabli&s;hed, importing that tho&s;e de|ductions
&s;hould be paid into the hands of receivers ap|pointed
by the King for that purpo&s;e; that all &s;ums de|ducted
under this act &s;hould be accounted for to &s;uch re|ceivers,
and the accounts audited and pa&s;&s;ed by them, and
not by the auditors of the impre&s;ts, or of the Exchequer;
that all di&s;putes relating to the collection of this duty &s;hould
be finally, and in a &s;ummary way, determined by the
barons of the Exchequer in England and Scotland re|&s;pectively;
that the commi&s;&s;ioners of the land-tax &s;hould
&s;ix and a&s;certain the &s;um total or amount of the perqui&s;ites
of every office and employment within their re&s;pective
di&s;tricts, di&s;tinct from the &s;alary thereunto belonging,
to be deducted under the &s;aid act, independently of any
former valuation or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of the &s;ame to the land-tax;
and &s;hould rate or a&s;&s;e&s;s all offices and employment, the per|qui&s;ites
whereof &s;hould be found to exceed the &s;um of
one hundred pounds per annum, at one &s;hilling for every
twenty thence ari&s;ing; that the receivers &s;hould tran&s;mit
to the commi&s;&s;ioners in every di&s;trict where any office or
employment is to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, an account of &s;uch offices and
employments, that upon being certified of the truth of
their amount they might be rated and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed accordingly;
that in all future a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments of the land-tax the &s;aid offices
and employments &s;hould not be valued at higher rates than
tho&s;e at which they were a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed towards the land-tax of
the thirty-fir&s;t year of the pre&s;ent reign; that the word
<PB N="414" REF="418">
perqui&s;ite &s;hould be under&s;tood to mean &s;uch profits of
offices and employments as ari&s;e from &s;ees e&s;tabli&s;hed by
cu&s;tom or authority, and payable either by the crown or
the &s;ubjects, in con&s;ideration of bu&s;ine&s;s done in the
cour&s;e of executing &s;uch offices and employments; and
that a commi&s;&s;ioner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any office or employment
might not interfere in the execution of the &s;aid act, ex|cept
in what might relate to his own employment. By the
four la&s;t clau&s;es &s;everal &s;alaries were exempted from the
payment of this duty. The objections made without
doors to this new law were the acce&s;&s;ion of pecuniary in|fluence
to the crown, by the creation of a new office and
officers, whereas this duty might have been ea&s;ily collected
and received by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the land-tax already
appointed, and the incon&s;i&s;tency that appeared between
the fifth and &s;eventh clau&s;es: in the former of the&s;e, the
commi&s;&s;ioners of the land-tax were ve&s;ted with the power
of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the perqui&s;ites of every office within their re|&s;pective
di&s;tricts, independent of any former valuation or
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of the &s;ame to the land-tax; and by the latter,
they are re&s;tricted from a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any office at a higher rate
than that of the thirty-fir&s;t year of the reign of George II.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. In the beginning of March petitions were
offered to the Hou&s;e by the merchants of Birmingham, in
Warwick&s;hire, and Sheffield, in York&s;hire, &s;pecifying that
the toy trade of the&s;e and many other towns con&s;i&s;ted ge|nerally
of articles in which gold and &s;ilver might be &s;aid
to be manufactured, though in &s;mall proportion, ina&s;much
as the &s;ale of them depended upon &s;light ornaments of
gold and &s;ilver: that by a clau&s;e pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion
of parliament, obliging every per&s;on who &s;hould &s;ell goods
or wares in which any gold or &s;ilver was manufactured
to take out an annual licen&s;e of forty &s;hillings, they the
petitioners were laid under great difficulties and di&s;advan|tages:
that not only the fir&s;t &s;eller, but every per&s;on
through who&s;e hands the goods or wares pa&s;&s;ed to the con|&s;umer,
was required to take out the &s;aid licen&s;e; they,
therefore, reque&s;ted that the Hou&s;e would take the&s;e
<PB N="415" REF="419">
hard&s;hips and inequalities into con&s;ideration, and indulge
them with rea&s;onable relief. The committee, to which
this affair was referred having re&s;olved that this impo|&s;ition
was found detrimental to the toy and cutlery trade
of the kingdom, the Hou&s;e agreed to the re&s;olution, and a
bill being prepared, under the title of &startq;An act to amend
the act made in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, for repealing the duty
granted by an act of the &s;ixth year of the reign of his
late Maje&s;ty on &s;ilver plate, and for granting a duty on
licen&s;es to be taken out by all per&s;ons dealing in gold
and &s;ilver plate,&endq; was enacted into a law by the royal
&s;anction. By this new regulation, &s;mall quantities of gold
and &s;ilver plate were allowed to be &s;old without licen&s;e.
In&s;tead of the duty before payable upon licen&s;es, another
was granted, to be taken out by certain dealers in gold and
&s;ilver plate, pawnbrokers, and refiners. This affair being
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the Hou&s;e took into con&s;ideration the claims of
the proprietors of lands purcha&s;ed for the better &s;ecuring
of his Maje&s;ty's docks, &s;hips, and &s;tores at Chatham,
Port&s;mouth, and Plymouth; and for better fortifying the
town of Port&s;mouth and citadel of Plymouth, in pur&s;uance
of an act pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion. We have already &s;pe|cified
the &s;um granted for this purpo&s;e, in con&s;equence of a
re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e, upon which a bill being founded,
&s;oon pa&s;&s;ed into a law, without oppo&s;ition<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The next bill which was brought into the Hou&s;e related to the &s;um|mons i&s;&s;ued by the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Exci&s;e, and ju&s;tices of the peace, for the appearance of per&s;ons offending again&s;t, or for forfeitures incurred by the laws of Exci&s;e. As &s;ome doubts had ari&s;en with re&s;pect to the method of &s;ummoning in &s;uch ca&s;es, this bill, which obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent in due cour&s;e, enacted, that a &s;ummons left at the Hou&s;e, or u&s;ual place of re&s;i|dence, or with the wife, child, or menial &s;ervants of the per&s;on &s;o &s;ummoned, &s;hould be held as legal notice, as we$l as the leaving &s;uch notice at the hou&s;e, workhou&s;e, warehou&s;e, &s;hop, cellar, vault, or u&s;ual place of re&s;idence of &s;uch per&s;on, directed to him by his right or a&s;&s;umed name; and all dealers in coffee, tea, or chocolate were &s;ubjected to the penalty of twenty pounds as often as they &s;hould neglect to attend the commi&s;&s;ioners of Exci&s;e, when &s;ummoned in this manner.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. In the month of April, a bill was brought in for
the more effectual preventing the fraudulent importation
of cambricks; and whil&s;t it was under deliberation, &s;everal
<PB N="416" REF="420">
merchants and whole&s;ale drapers of the city of London
pre&s;ented a petition, repre&s;enting the grievances to which
they, and many thou&s;ands of other traders, would be &s;ub|jected,
&s;hould the bill, as it then &s;tood, be pa&s;&s;ed into a
law. According to their reque&s;t, they were heard by
their coun&s;el on the merits of this remon&s;trance, and
&s;ome amendments were made to the bill in their favour.
At length it received the royal a&s;&s;ent, and became a law
to the following effect: It enacted, that no cambricks,
French lawns, or linens of this kind, u&s;ually entered
under the denomination of cambricks, &s;hould be imported
after the fir&s;t day of next Augu&s;t, but in bales, ca&s;es, or
boxes, covered with &s;ackcloth or canvas, containing each
one hundred whole pieces, or two hundred half pieces, on
penalty of forfeiting the whole: that cambricks and French
lawns &s;hould be imported for exportation only, lodged in
the king's warehou&s;e, and delivered out under like &s;ecurity
and re&s;trictions as prohibited Ea&s;t-India merchandi&s;e&punc;
and, on importation, pay only the half &s;ub&s;idy: that all
cambricks and French lawns in the cu&s;tody of any per&s;ons
&s;hould be depo&s;ited, by the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, in the king's
warehou&s;es, the bonds thereupon be delivered up, and the
drawback on exportation paid; yet the goods &s;hould not
be delivered out again but for exportation: that cambricks
and French lawns expo&s;ed to &s;ale, or found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of private per&s;ons, after the &s;aid day, &s;hould be forfeited,
and liable to be &s;earched for, and &s;ei&s;ed, in like manner
as other prohibited and uncu&s;tomed goods are; and the
offender &s;hould forfeit two hundred pounds, over and above
all other penalties and forfeitures inflicted by any former
act: that if any doubt &s;hould ari&s;e concerning the &s;pecies
or quality of the goods, or the place where they were
manufactured, the proof &s;hould lie on the owner: finally,
that the penalty of five pounds, inflicted by a former act,
and payable to the informer, on any per&s;on that &s;hould
wear any cambrick or French lawns, &s;hould &s;till remain in
force, and be recoverable, on conviction, by oath of one
witne&s;s, before one ju&s;tice of the peace.&mdash;The la&s;t &s;ucce&s;s|ful
<PB N="417" REF="421">
bill which this &s;e&s;&s;ion produced was that relating to the
augmentation of the &s;alaries of the judges in his Ma|je&s;ty's
&s;uperior courts of ju&s;tice. A motion having been
made for an in&s;truction to the committee of &s;upply, to
con&s;ider of the &s;aid augmentation, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer acquainted the Hou&s;e that this augmentation
was recommended to them by his Maje&s;ty. Neverthele&s;s,
the motion was oppo&s;ed, and a warm debate en&s;ued. At
length, however, being carried in the affirmative, the
committee agreed to certain re&s;olutions, on which a bill
was founded. While it remained under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, a
motion was made for an in&s;truction to the committee, that
they &s;hould have power to receive a clau&s;e or clau&s;es
for re&s;training the judges, comprehended within the pro|vi&s;ions
of the bill, from receiving any fee, gift, pre&s;ent, or
entertainment from any city, town, borough, or corpo|ration,
or from any &s;heriff, jailer, or other officer, upon
their &s;everal re&s;pective circuits, and from taking any gra|tuity
from any office or officer of any of the courts of law.
Another motion was made, for a clau&s;e re&s;training &s;uch
judges, barons, and ju&s;tices, as were comprehended with|in
the provi&s;ions of the bill, from interfering, otherwi&s;e
than by giving their own votes, in any election of mem|bers
to &s;erve in parliament; but both the&s;e propo&s;als,
being put to the vote, were carried in the negative.
The&s;e two motions being over-ruled by the majority, the
bill underwent &s;ome amendments; and, having pa&s;&s;ed
through both Hou&s;es in the ordinary cour&s;e, was enacted
into a law by the royal &s;anction. With re&s;pect to the
import of this act, it is no other than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
the &s;everal &s;tamp-duties, applied to the augmentation;
and the appropriation of their produce in &s;uch a manner,
that the crown cannot alter the application of the &s;ums
thus granted in parliament. But, on this occa&s;ion, no
attempt was made in favour of the independency of the
judges, which &s;eems to have been invaded by a late in|terpretation
of, or rather by a deviation from, the act of
&s;ettlement; in which it is expre&s;sly ordained, that the
<PB N="418" REF="422">
commi&s;&s;ions of the judges &s;hould continue in force <HI>quam dia
&s;e bene ge&s;&s;erine;</HI> that their &s;alaries &s;hould be fixed, and
none of them removeable but by an addre&s;s of both Hou&s;es
of parliament. It was then, without all doubt, the in|tention
of the legi&s;lature that every judge &s;hould enjoy
his office during life, unle&s;s convicted by legal trial of
&s;ome mi&s;behaviour, or unle&s;s both Hou&s;es of parliament
&s;hould concur in de&s;iring his removal: but the doctrine
now adopted imports, that no commi&s;&s;ion can continue
in force longer than the life of the King by whom it was
granted; that therefore the commi&s;&s;ions of the judges mu$t
be renewed by a new king a his acce&s;&s;ion, who &s;hould
have it in his power to employ either tho&s;e whom he
finds acting as judges at his acce&s;&s;ion, or confer their
offices on others, with no other re&s;traint than that the
condition of the new commi&s;&s;ions &s;hould be <HI>quam dia &s;e
bene ge&s;&s;erint.</HI> Thus the office of a judge is rendered
more precarious, and the influence of the crown receives
a con&s;iderable re-enforcement.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. Among the bills that mi&s;carried in the cour&s;e
of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, we may number a &s;econd attempt to carry
into execution the &s;cheme which was offered la&s;t year for
the more effectual manning the navy, preventing de&s;ertion,
and relieving and encouraging the &s;eamen of Great-Bri|tain.
A bill was accordingly brought in, couched
in nearly the &s;ame terms which had been rejected in
the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion; and it was &s;upported by a con&s;iderable
number of members, animated with a true &s;pirit of pa|trioti&s;m:
but to the trading part of the nation it appeared
one of tho&s;e plau&s;ible projects, which, though agreeable in
&s;peculation, can never be reduced into practice without a con|comitancy
of greater evils than tho&s;e they were intended to
remove. While the bill remained under the con&s;ideration
of the Hou&s;e, petitions were pre&s;ented again&s;t it by the mer|chants
of Bri&s;tol, Scarborough, Whitby, King&s;ton-upon-Hull,
and Lanca&s;ter, repre&s;enting, That, by &s;uch a law&punc;
the trade of the kingdom, which is the nur&s;ery and &s;upport
of &s;eamen at all times, and that &s;pirit of equipping private
<PB N="419" REF="423">
&s;hips of war, which had been of di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ervice to
the nation, would be laid under &s;uch difficulties as might
cau&s;e a great &s;tagnation in the former, and a total &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion
of the latter; the bill, therefore would be highly
prejudicial to the marine of the kingdom, and altogether
ineffectual for the purpo&s;es intended. A great number of
books and papers, relating to trading &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els as well
as to &s;eamen, and other per&s;ons protected or pre&s;&s;ed into the
navy, and to expen&s;es occa&s;ioned by pre&s;&s;ing men into
the navy, were examined in a committee of the whole
Hou&s;e, and the bill was improved with many amend|ments:
may, after it was printed and engro&s;&s;ed, &s;everal
clau&s;es were added by way of rider; yet &s;till the experi|ment
&s;eemed dangerous. The motion for its being pa&s;&s;ed
was violently oppo&s;ed; warm debates en&s;ued; they were
adjourned, and re&s;umed; and the arguments again&s;t the
bill appeared at length in &s;uch a &s;triking light, that, when
the que&s;tion was put, the majority declared for the nega|tive.
The regulations which had been made in parlia|ment
during the twenty-&s;ixth, the twenty-eighth, and
thirtieth years of the pre&s;ent reign, for the pre&s;ervation of
the publick roads, being attended with &s;ome inconve|niencies
in certain parts of the kingdom, petitions were
brought from &s;ome counties in Wales, as well as from the
freeholders of Hereford&s;hire, the farmers of Middle&s;ex,
and others, enumerating the difficulties attending the u&s;e
of broad wheels in one ca&s;e, and the limitation of hor&s;es
u&s;ed in drawing carriages with narrow wheels in the other.
The matter of the&s;e remon&s;trances was con&s;idered in a
committee of the whole Hou&s;e, which re&s;olved that the
weight to be carried by all waggons and carts travelling on
the turnpike roads &s;hould be limited. On this re&s;olution
a bill was framed, for amending and reducing into one act
of parliament the three acts before mentioned for the
pre&s;ervation of the publick highways: but &s;ome objections
being &s;tarted, and a petition interpo&s;ed by the land-owners
of Suffolk and Norfolk, alledging that the bill, if pa&s;&s;ed
into a law, would render it impo&s;&s;ible to bring fre&s;h provi|&s;ions
<PB N="420" REF="424">
from tho&s;e counties to London, as the &s;upply de|pended
ab&s;olutely upon the quickne&s;s of conveyance, the
further con&s;ideration of it was po&s;tponed to a longer day,
and never re&s;umed in the &s;equel: &s;o that the attempt
mi&s;carried.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. Of all the &s;ubjects which, in the cour&s;e of this
&s;e&s;&s;ion, fell under the cognizance of parliament, there
was none that more intere&s;ted the humanity or challenged
the redre&s;s of the ligi&s;lature than did the ca&s;e of the poor
in&s;olvent debtors, who langui&s;hed under all the mi&s;eries of
indigence and impri&s;onment. In the month of February
a petition was offered to the Commons in behalf of bank|rupts,
who repre&s;ented, That having &s;crupulou&s;ly con|formed
to the laws made concerning bankruptcy, by &s;ur|rendering
their all upon oath for the benefit of their credi|tors,
they had neverthele&s;s been refu&s;ed their certificates,
without any probability of relief; that by this cruel re|fu&s;al,
many bankrupts had been obliged to ab&s;cond, while
others were immured in pri&s;on, and the&s;e unhappy &s;uffer|ers
groaned under the particular hard&s;hip of being excluded
from the benefit of law occa&s;ionally made for the relief of
in&s;olvent debtors; that the power ve&s;ted in creditors of
refu&s;ing certificates to their bankrupts was, as the peti|tioners
conceived, founded upon a pre&s;umption that &s;uch
power would be tenderly exerci&s;ed, and never but in noto|rious
ca&s;es; but the great increa&s;e in the number of bank|rupts
within two years pa&s;t, and the &s;mall proportion of
tho&s;e who had been able to obtain their certificates, &s;eemed
to demon&s;trate that the power had been u&s;ed for cruel and
unju&s;t purpo&s;es, contrary to the intention of the le|gi&s;lature:
that as the greater part of the petitioners, and
their fellow-&s;ufferers, mu&s;t inevitably and &s;peedily peri&s;h,
with their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed families, unle&s;s &s;ea&s;onably relieved by
the interpo&s;ition of parliament, they implored the com|pa&s;&s;ion
of the Hou&s;e, from which they hoped immediate
favour and relief. This petition was accompanied with a
printed ca&s;e, explaining the nature of the laws relating to
bankrupts, and pointing out their defects in point of policy
<PB N="421" REF="425">
as well as humanity; but little regard was &s;eemingly paid
to either remon&s;trance. Other petitions, however, being
pre&s;ented by in&s;olvent debtors impri&s;oned in different jails
within the kingdom, leave was given to bring in a bill
for their relief, and a committee appointed to examine
the laws relating to bankruptcy.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. Among other petitionary remon&s;trances on
this &s;ubject, the members were &s;eparately pre&s;ented with
the printed ca&s;e of Captain George Walker, a pri&s;oner in
the jail of the King's-Bench, who had been declared a
bankrupt and complained, that he had been &s;ubjected to
&s;ome flagrant acts of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion. The ca&s;e
contained &s;uch extraordinary allegations, and the captain's
character was &s;o remarkably fair and intere&s;ting, that the
committee, which were empowered to &s;end for per&s;ons,
papers, and records, re&s;olved to enquire into the particu|lars
of his misfortune. A motion was made and agreed
to, that the mar&s;hal of the pri&s;on &s;hould bring the captain
before the committee, and the Speaker's warrant was
i&s;&s;ued accordingly. The pri&s;oner was produced, and ex|amined
at &s;everal &s;ittings; and &s;ome of the members ex|pre&s;&s;ed
a laudable eagerne&s;s to do him ju&s;tice: but his
antagoni&s;ts were very powerful, and left no &s;tone un|turned
to fru&s;trate the purpo&s;e of the enquiry, which was
dropped of cour&s;e at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. Thus the un|fortunate
Captain Walker, who had, in the late war,
remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf at &s;ea by his courage and
conduct, repeatedly &s;ignali&s;ed him&s;elf again&s;t the enemies of
his country, was &s;ent back, without redre&s;s, to the gloomy
man&s;ions of a jail, where he had already pined for &s;everal
years, u&s;ele&s;s to him&s;elf, and lo&s;t to the community,
while he might have been profitably employed in retriev|ing
his own fortune, and exerting his talents for the ge|neral
advantage of the nation. While this affair was in
agitation, the bill for the relief of in&s;olvent debtors was
prepared, printed, and read a &s;econd time; but, when the
motion was made for its being committed, a debate aro&s;e,
and this was adjourned from time to time till the end of
<PB N="422" REF="426">
the &s;e&s;&s;ion. In the mean time, the committee continued to
deliberate upon the laws relating to bankruptcy; and
in the beginning of June reported their re&s;olution to the
Hou&s;e, that, in their opinion, &s;ome amendments might
be made to the laws concerning bankruptcy; to be ad|vantage
of creditors, and relief of in&s;olvents. Such
was the notice vouch&s;afed to the cries of many British
&s;ubjects, deprived of liberty, and de&s;titute of the com|mon
nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. It would engage us in a long digre&s;&s;ive di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion,
were we to enquire how the &s;pirit of the laws in
England, &s;o framed for lenity, has been exa&s;perated into
&s;uch &s;everity again&s;t in&s;olvent debtors; and why, among
a people &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for genero&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion,
the jails &s;hould be more filled with pri&s;oners than they are
in any other part of Chri&s;tendom. Perhaps both the&s;e de|viations
from a general character are violent efforts of a wary
legi&s;lature made in behalf of trade, which cannot be too
much cheri&s;hed in a nation that principally depends upon
commerce. The que&s;tion is, whether this laudable aim may
not be more effectually accompli&s;hed, without &s;ubjecting in|dividuals
to oppre&s;&s;ion, ari&s;ing from the cruelty and revenge
of one another. As the laws are modelled at pre&s;ent, it
cannot be denied that the debtor, in &s;ome ca&s;es, lies in a
peculiar manner at the mercy of his creditor. By the ori|ginal
and common law of England, no man could be im|pri&s;oned
for debt. The plaintiff in any civil action
could have no execution upon his judgement again&s;t either
the body or the lands of the defendant: even with re&s;pect
to his good and chattels, which were &s;ubject to execution,
he was obliged to leave him &s;uch articles as were nece&s;&s;ary
for agriculture. But, in proce&s;s of time, this indulgence
being found prejudicial to commerce, a law was enacted,
in the reign of Edward the Fir&s;t, allowing execution on
the per&s;on of the debtor, provided his goods and chattels
were not &s;ufficient to pay the debt which he had contracted.
This law was &s;till attended with a very obvious inconve|nience.
The debtor who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an e&s;tate in lands was
<PB N="423" REF="427">
tempted to &s;ecrete his moveable effects, and live in con|cealment
on the produce of his lands, while the &s;heriff
connived at his retirement. To remove this evil, a &s;econd
&s;tatute was enacted in the &s;ame reign, granting immediate
execution again&s;t the body, lands, and goods of the debtor;
yet his effects could not be &s;old for the benefit of his credi|tor
till the expiration of three months, during which he
him&s;elf could di&s;po&s;e of them for ready money, in order
to di&s;charge his incumbrances. If the creditor was not
&s;atisfied in this manner, he continued in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
debtor's lands, and detained the debtor him&s;elf in pri&s;on,
where he was obliged to &s;upply him with bread and water
for his &s;upport, until the debt was di&s;charged. Other
&s;evere regulations were made in the &s;equel, particularly
in the reign of Edward the Third, which gave ri&s;e to the
writ of <HI>capias ad &s;atisfaciendum.</HI> This, indeed, rendered
the preceding laws, called &s;tatute-merchant, and &s;tatute-&s;taple,
altogether unnece&s;&s;ary. Though the liberty of
the &s;ubject, and the &s;ecurity of the landholder, were thus,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;acrificed to the advantage of commerce,
an impri&s;oned debtor was not left entirely at the mercy of
an inexorable creditor. If he made all the &s;atisfaction
in his power, and could &s;how that his in&s;olvency was
owing to real misfortunes, the court of Chancery inter|po&s;ed
on his petition, and actually ordered him to be di&s;|charged
from pri&s;on, when no good rea&s;on for detaining
him could be a&s;&s;igned. This interpo&s;ition, which &s;eems
naturally to belong to a court of equity, con&s;tituted with
a view to mitigate the rigour of the common law, cea&s;ed,
in all probability, after the re&s;toration of Charles the
Second, and of con&s;equence the pri&s;ons were filled with
debtors. Then the legi&s;lature charged them&s;elves with
the exten&s;ion of a power, which perhaps a chancellor no
longer thought him&s;elf &s;afe in exerci&s;ing; and in the year
one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy, pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t act
for the relief of in&s;olvent debtors, granting a relea&s;e to
all pri&s;oners for debt, without di&s;tinction or enquiry.
By this general indulgence, which has even in a great
<PB N="424" REF="428">
mea&s;ure continued in all &s;ub&s;equent acts of the &s;ame kind,
the lenity of the parliament may be &s;ometimes mi&s;applied,
ina&s;much as in&s;olvency is often criminal, ar&s;ing from
profligacy and extravagance, which de&s;erve to be &s;everely
puni&s;hed. Yet, even for this &s;pecies of in&s;olvency, per|petual
impri&s;onment, aggravated by the mi&s;eries of ex|treme
indigence, and the danger of peri&s;hing through
famine, may be deemed a puni&s;hment too &s;evere. How
cruel then mu&s;t it be to leave the mo&s;t innocent bankrupt
expo&s;ed to this puni&s;hment, from the revenge or $ini&s;ter
de&s;ign of a mercile&s;s creditor; a creditor, by who&s;e fraud
perhaps the pri&s;oner became a bankrupt, and by who&s;e
craft he is detained in jail, le&s;t, by his di&s;charge from pri|&s;on,
he &s;hould be enabled to &s;eek that redre&s;s in Chancery
to which he is entitled on a fair account! The &s;everity of
the law was certainly intended again&s;t fraudulent bankrupts
only; and the &s;tatute of bankruptcy is, doubtle&s;s, favour|able
to in&s;olvents, as it di&s;charges from all former debts
tho&s;e who obtain their certificates. As Briti&s;h &s;ubjects,
they are &s;urely entitled to the &s;ame indulgence which is
granted to other in&s;olvents. They were always included
in every act pa&s;&s;ed for the relief of in&s;olvent debtors, till
the &s;ixth year of George I. when they were fir&s;t excepted
from this benefit. By a law enacted in the reign of Queen
Anne, relating to bankruptcy, any creditor was at liberty
to object to the confirmation of the bankrupt's certificate;
but the chancellor had power to judge whether the ob|jection
was frivolous or well founded: yet, by a later act,
the chancellor is obliged to confirm the certificate, if it
is agreeable to four-fifths in number and value of the credi|tors;
whereas he cannot confirm it, &s;hould he be oppo&s;ed,
even without any rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned, by one creditor to whom
the greate&s;t part of the debt is owing. It might, there|fore,
de&s;erve the con&s;ideration of parliament, whether,
in extending their clemency to the poor, it &s;hould not be
equally diffu&s;ed to bankrupts and other in&s;olvents; whether
proper di&s;tinction ought not to be made between the inno|cent
bankrupt, who fails through misfortunes in trade,
<PB N="425" REF="429">
and him who becomes in&s;olvent from fraud or profligacy;
and finally, whether the enquiry and trial of all &s;uch ca&s;es
would not properly fall within the province of chancery,
a tribunal in&s;tituted for the mitigation of common law?</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. The Hou&s;e of Commons &s;eems to have been
determined on another mea&s;ure, which, however, does
not admit of explanation. An order was made in the
month of February, that leave &s;hould be given to bring
in a bill to explain, amend, and render effectual &s;o much
of an act, pa&s;&s;ed in the thirteenth year of George II.
again&s;t the exce&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of hor&s;e-races, and deceitful
gaming, as related to that increa&s;e. The bill was accord|ingly
pre&s;ented, read, printed, and ordered to be com|mitted
to a committee of the whole Hou&s;e; but the order
was delayed from time to time till the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion.
Some progre&s;s was likewi&s;e made in another affair of
greater con&s;equence to the community. A committee
was appointed in the month of March, to take into con|&s;ideration
the &s;tate of the poor in England, as well as the
laws enacted for their maintenance. The clerks of the
peace belonging to all the counties, cities, and towns in
England and Wales, were ordered to tran&s;mit, for the
peru&s;al of the Hou&s;e, an account of the annual expen&s;e
of pa&s;&s;ing vagrants through their re&s;pective divi&s;ions and
di&s;tricts for four years; and the committee began to de|liberate
on this important &s;ubject. In the latter end of
May the Hou&s;e was made acquainted with their re&s;o|lutions,
importing, that the pre&s;ent method of relieving
the poor in the re&s;pective pari&s;hes, where no workhou&s;es
have been provided for their reception and employment,
are, in general, very burthen&s;ome to the inhabitants, and
tend to render the poor mi&s;erable to them&s;elves, and u&s;e|le&s;s
to the community: that the pre&s;ent method of giving
money out of the parochial rates to per&s;ons capable of
labour, in order to prevent them from claiming an entire
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence for them&s;elves and their families, is contrary
to the &s;pirit and intention of the laws for the relief of the
poor, is a dangerous power in the hands of parochial
<PB N="426" REF="430">
officers, a mi&s;application of the publick money, and a
great encouragement to idlene&s;s and intemperance: that
the employment of the poor, under proper direction
and management, in &s;uch works and manufactures as are
&s;uited to their re&s;pective capacities, would be of great
utility to the publick: that &s;ettling the poor in workhou&s;es,
to be provided in the &s;everal counties and ridings in Eng|land
and Wales, under the direction and management of
governors and tru&s;tees to be appointed for that purpo&s;e,
would be the mo&s;t effectual method of relieving &s;uch poor
per&s;ons, as, by age, infirmities, or di&s;ea&s;es, are rendered
incapable of &s;upporting them&s;elves by their labour; of
employing the able and indu&s;trious, reforming the idle and
profligate, and of educating poor children in religion and
indu&s;try: that the poor in &s;uch workhou&s;es would be
better regulated and maintained, and managed with more
advantage to the publick, by guardians, governors, or
tru&s;tees, to be &s;pecially appointed, or cho&s;en for the
purpo&s;e, and incorporated with &s;uch powers, and under
&s;uch re&s;trictions, as the legi&s;lature &s;hould deem proper,
than by the annual parochial officers: that erecting work|hou&s;es
upon wa&s;te lands, and appropriating a certain
quantity of &s;uch lands to be cultivated, in order to produce
provi&s;ion for the poor in the &s;aid hou&s;es, would not only
be a means of in&s;tructing and employing many of the &s;aid
poor in agriculture, but le&s;&s;en the expen&s;e of the publick:
that controver&s;ies and law-&s;uits concerning the &s;ettle|ments
of poor per&s;ons occa&s;ioned a very great, and, in
general, an u&s;ele&s;s expen&s;e to the publick, amounting to
many thou&s;and pounds per annum; and that often more
money is expended in a&s;certaining &s;uch &s;ettlements, by each
of the contending pari&s;hes, than would be &s;ufficient to
maintain the paupers: that &s;hould workhou&s;es be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
for the general reception of the poor, in the re&s;pective
counties and ridings of England, the laws relating to
the &s;ettlements of the poor, and the pa&s;&s;ing of vagrants,
might be repealed: that while the pre&s;ent laws relating to
the poor &s;ub&s;i&s;t, the compelling pari&s;h-officers to grant
<PB N="427" REF="431">
certificates to the poor would, in all probability, prevent
the hard&s;hips they now &s;uffer, in being debarred gaining
their livelihood, where they can do it mo&s;tu&s;efully to them|&s;elves
and the publick. From the&s;e &s;en&s;ible re&s;olutions,
the reader may conceive &s;ome idea of the mi&s;conduct that
attends the management of the poor in England, as well
as of the grievous burthens entailed upon the people by
the pre&s;ent laws which con&s;titute this branch of the legi&s;|lature.
The committee's re&s;olves being read at the table,
an order was made that they &s;hould be taken into con&s;ider|ation
on a certain day, when the order was again put off,
and in the interim the parliament was prorogued. While
the committee deliberated upon this affair, leave was given
to prepare a bill for preventing tenants under a certain
yearly rent from gaining &s;ettlements in any particular
pari&s;h, by being there rated in any land-tax a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment,
and paying for the landlord the money &s;o charged. This
order was afterwards di&s;charged; and another bill brought
in, to prevent any per&s;on from gaining a &s;ettlement, by
being rated by virtue of an act of parliament for granting
any aid to his Maje&s;ty by a land-tax, and paying the
&s;ame. The bill was accordingly pre&s;ented, read, com|mitted,
and pa&s;&s;ed the Lower Hou&s;e; but among the
Lords it mi&s;carried. It can never be expected that the
poor will be managed with oeconomy and integrity,
while the execution of the laws relating to their mainte|nance
is left in the hands of low trade&s;men, who derive
private advantage from &s;upplying them with nece&s;&s;aries,
and often favour the impo&s;ition of one another with the
mo&s;t &s;candalous collu&s;ion. This is an evil which will
never be remedied, until per&s;ons of independent fortune,
and unblemi&s;hed integrity, actuated by a &s;pirit of true
patrioti&s;m, &s;hall re&s;cue their fellow-citizens from the
power of &s;uch intere&s;ted mi&s;creants, by taking the poor
into their own management and protection. In&s;tead of
multiplying laws with re&s;pect to the &s;ettlement and ma|nagement
of the poor, which &s;erve only to puzzle and
perplex the pari&s;h and peace officers, it would become the
<PB N="428" REF="432">
&s;agacity of the ligi&s;lature to take &s;ome effectual precautions
to prevent the increa&s;e of paupers and vagrants, which is
become an intolerable nui&s;ance to the commonwealth.
Towards this &s;alutary end, &s;urely nothing would more
contribute than a reformation of the police, that would
aboli&s;h tho&s;e infamous places of entertainment, which
&s;warm in every corner of the metropolis, &s;educing people of
all ranks to extravagance, profligacy, and ruin; that would
re&s;trict within due bounds the number of publick-hou&s;es,
which are augmented to an enormous degree, affording &s;o
many a&s;ylums for riot and debauchery, and corrupting
the morals of the common people to &s;uch a pitch of licen|tious
indecency, as mu&s;t be a reproach to every civili&s;ed
nation. Let it not be affirmed, to the di&s;grace of Great-Britain,
that &s;uch receptacles of vice and impunity &s;ub&s;i&s;t
under the connivance of the government, according to the
narrow views and confined &s;peculation of tho&s;e &s;hallow
politicians, who imagine that the revenue is increa&s;ed in
proportion to the quantity of &s;trong liquors con&s;umed in
&s;uch infamous rece&s;&s;es of intemperance. Were this in
reality the ca&s;e, that admini&s;tration would de&s;erve to be
branded with eternal infamy, which could &s;acrifice to
&s;uch a ba&s;e con&s;ideration the health, the lives, and the
morals of their fellow-creatures: but nothing can be more
fallacious, than the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the revenue of any
government can be increa&s;ed by the augmented intempe|rance
of the people; for intemperance is the bane of in|du&s;try,
as well as of population; and what the government
gains in the articles of the duty on malt, and the exci&s;e
upon liquors, will always be greatly over-balanced by the
lo&s;s in other articles, ari&s;ing from the diminution of hands,
and the neglect of labour.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. Exclu&s;ive of the bills that were actually pre|pared,
though they did not pa&s;s in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion,
the Commons deliberated on other important &s;ubjects,
which, however, were not finally di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. In the begin|ning
of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, a committee being appointed to re|&s;ume
the enquiry touching the regulation of weights and
<PB N="429" REF="433">
mea&s;ures, a &s;ubject we have mentioned in the hi&s;tory of
the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, the box which contained a Troy
pound weight, locked up by order of the Hou&s;e, was
again produced by the clerk in who&s;e cu&s;tody it had been
depo&s;ited. This affair being carefully inve&s;tigated, the
committee agree to fourteen re&s;olutions<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">As the curio&s;ity of the reader may be intere&s;ted in the&s;e re&s;olutions, we &s;hall here in&s;ert them for his &s;atisfaction. The committee re&s;olved, that the ell ought to contain one yard and one quarter, according to the yard men|tioned in the third re&s;olution of the former committee upon the &s;ubject of weights and mea&s;ures: that the pole, or per$h, &s;hould contain in length five &s;uch yards and a half; the $ur long two hundred and twenty; and the mile one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;ixty: that the &s;uperficial perch &s;hould contain thirty &s;quare yards and a quarter; the rood one thou&s;and two hundred and ten; and the acre four thou&s;and eight hundred and forty: that according to the fourth, fifth, and &s;ixth re&s;olutions of the former committee, upon the &s;ubject of weights and mea&s;ures, agreed to by the Hou&s;e on the &s;econd day of June in the preceding year, the quart ought to contain &s;eventy cubical inches and one half; the pint thirty-five and one quarter; the peck five hundred and &s;ixty-four; and the bu&s;hel two thou&s;and two hundred and fifty-&s;ix. That the &s;everal parts of the pound, mentioned in the eighth re&s;olution of the former committee, examined and adju&s;ted in pre&s;ence of this committee, viz. the half pound or &s;ix ounces, quarter of a pound or three ounces, two ounces, one ounce, two half ounces, the five penny-weight, three penny weight, two-penny weight, and one penny weight, the twelve grains, &s;ix grains, three grains, two grains, and two of one grain each, ought to be the models of the &s;everal parts of the &s;aid pound, and to be u&s;ed for $izing or ad|ju&s;ting weights for the future. That all weights exceeding a pound &s;hould be of bra&s;s, copper, bell-metal, or ca&s;t-iron: and all tho&s;e of ca&s;t-iron &s;hould be made in the form, and with a handle of hammered iron, &s;uch as the pattern herewith produced, having the mark of the weight ca&s;t in the iron: and all weights of a pound, or under, &s;hould be of gold, &s;ilver, bra&s;s, copper, or bell-metal. That all weights of ca&s;t-iron &s;hould have the initial letters of the name of the maker upon the upper bar of the handle; and all other weights &s;hould have the &s;ame, together with the mark of the weight, according to this &s;tandard, upon &s;ome convenient part thereof. That the yard, mentioned in the &s;econd re&s;olution of the former committee, upon the &s;ubject of weights and mea&s;ures, agreed to by the Hou&s;e in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, being the &s;tandard of length, and the pound, mentioned in the eighth re&s;olu|tion, being the &s;tandard of weight, ought to be depo&s;ited in the court of the receipt of the Exchequer, and there &s;afely kept under the &s;eals of the chancel|lor of the &s;aid Exchequer, and of the chief baron, and the &s;eal of office of the chamberlain of the Exchequer, and not to be opened but by the order and in the pre&s;ence of the chancellor of the Exchequer and chief baron for the time being. That the mo&s;t effectual means to a&s;certain uniformity in mea|&s;ures of length and weight, to be u&s;ed throughout the realm, would be to appoint certain per&s;ons at one particular office, with clerks and workmen under them, for the purpo&s;e only of &s;izing and adju&s;ting, for the u&s;e of the &s;ubjects, all mea&s;ures of length, and all weights, being parts, multiples, or certain proportions of the &s;tandards to be u&s;ed for the future. That a model or pattern of the &s;aid &s;tandard yard, mentioned in the &s;econd re&s;olution of the former committee, and now in the cu&s;tody of the clerk of the Hou&s;e, and a model or pattern of the &s;tandard pound, mentioned in the eighth re&s;olution of that committee, together with models or patterns of the parts of the &s;aid pound, now pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e, and al&s;o of the multiples of the &s;aid pound, mentioned in this report (when the &s;ame are adju&s;ted) &s;hould be kept in the &s;aid office, in cu&s;tody of the &s;aid per&s;ons to be appointed for &s;izing weights and mea&s;ures, under the &s;eal of the chief baron of the Exchequer for the time being, to be opened only by order of the &s;aid chief baron, in his pre&s;ence, or the pre&s;ence of one of the barons of the Exchequer, on the appli|cation of the &s;aid per&s;ons, for the purpo&s;e of correcting and adju&s;ting, as occa|&s;ion &s;hould require, the patterns or models u&s;ed at the &s;aid office, for &s;izing mea&s;ures of length and weight, delivered out to the &s;ubjects. That models or patterns of the &s;aid &s;tandard yard and &s;tandard pound afore&s;aid, and al&s;o models or patterns of the parts and multiples afore&s;aid of the &s;aid pound, &s;hould be lodged in the &s;aid office for the &s;izing of &s;uch mea&s;ures of length or weight, as, being parts, multiples, or proportions of the &s;aid &s;tandards, &s;hould hereafter be required by any of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects. That all mea|&s;ures of length and weight, &s;ized at the &s;aid office, &s;hould be marked in &s;ome convenient part thereof with &s;uch marks as &s;hould be thought expedient, to &s;hew the identity of the mea&s;ures and weights &s;ized at the &s;aid office, and to di&s;cover any frauds that may be committed therein. That the &s;aid office &s;hould be kept within a convenient di&s;tance of the court of Exchequer at We&s;tmin&s;ter; and that all mea&s;ures of length and weight, within a certain di&s;tance of London, &s;hould be corrected and re-a&s;&s;ized, as occa&s;ion &s;hould re|quire, at the &s;aid office. That, in order to enforce the uniformity in weights and mea&s;ures to be u&s;ed for the future, all per&s;ons appointed by the crown to act as ju&s;tices of the peace in any county, city, or town corporate, being re&s;pectively counties within them&s;elves, throughout the realm, &s;hould be em|powered to hear and determine, and put the law in execution, in re&s;pect to weights and mea&s;ures only, without any of them being obliged to &s;ue out a <HI>dedimus,</HI> or to act in any other matter: and the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be empowered to &s;ue, impri&s;on, inflict, or mitigate &s;uch penalties as &s;hould be thought proper; and have &s;uch other authorities as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for compelling the u&s;e of weights and mea&s;ures, agreeably to the afore&s;aid &s;tand|ards. That models or pattern of the &s;aid &s;tandard yard and pound, and of the parts and multiples thereof, before-mentioned, &s;hould be di&s;tributed in each county, in &s;uch a manner as to be readily u&s;ed for evidence in all ca&s;es where mea&s;ures and weights &s;hould be que&s;tioned before the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioner&punc; and for adju&s;ting the &s;ame in a proper manner.</NOTE> In the mean
<PB N="430" REF="434">
time it was ordered, that all weights, referred to in the
report, &s;hould be delivered to the clerk of the Hou&s;e, to
be locked up, and brought forth again occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="435">
&sect; XXVI. The Hou&s;e of Commons, among other ar|ticles
of dome&s;tick oeconomy, be&s;towed &s;ome attention on
the ho&s;pital for foundlings, which was now, more than
ever, become a matter of national con&s;ideration. The
accounts relating to this charity having been demanded,
and &s;ubjected to the in&s;pection of the members, were, to|gether
with the King's recommendation, referred to the
committee of &s;upply, where they produced the re&s;olutions
which we have already &s;pecified among the other grants
of the year. The Hou&s;e afterwards re&s;olved it&s;elf into a
committee, to deliberate on the &s;tate of the ho&s;pital, and
examine its accounts. On the third day of May their re|&s;olutions
were reported to the following effect: That the
appointing, by the governors and guardians of the &s;aid
ho&s;pital, places in the &s;everal counties, ridings, or di|vi&s;ions
in this kingdom, for the fir&s;t reception of expo&s;ed
and de&s;erted young children would be attended with
many evil con&s;equences; and that the conveying of
children from the country to the &s;aid ho&s;pital is attended
with many evil con&s;equences, and ought to be prevented.
A bill was ordered to be brought in, founded upon this
la&s;t re&s;olution; but never pre&s;ented, therefore the enquiry
produced no effect. Notwith&s;tanding the in&s;titution of
this charity, for the &s;upport of which great &s;ums are yearly
levied on the publick, it does not appear that the bills of
mortality, re&s;pecting new-born children, are decrea&s;ed,
nor the &s;hocking crime of infant-murther rendered le&s;s
frequent than heretofore. It may, therefore, be not im|properly
&s;tiled a heavy additional tax for the propagation
of ba&s;tardy, and the encouragement of idlene&s;s, among the
common people; be&s;ides the tendency it has to extingui&s;h
the feelings of the heart, and di&s;&s;olve tho&s;e family ties of
blood by which the charities are connected.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. In the month of March leave was given to
bring in a bill for the more effectual preventing of the
melting down and exporting the gold and &s;ilver coin of
the kingdom, and the per&s;ons were nominated to prepare
<PB N="432" REF="436">
it; but the bill never appeared, and no further enquiry
was made about the matter. Perhaps it was &s;uppo&s;ed
that &s;uch a mea&s;ure might be thought an encroachment on
the prerogative of the crown, which hath always exerci&s;ed
the power of fixing the &s;tandard and regulating the cur|rency
of the coin. Perhaps &s;uch a &s;tep was deferred on
account of the war, during which a great quantity of
gold and &s;ilver was nece&s;&s;arily exported to the continent,
for the &s;upport of the allies and armies in the pay of
Great-Britain. The legi&s;lature, however, would do well
to con&s;ider this eternal maxim in computation, that when
a greater quantity of bullion is exported, in wa&s;te, than
can be replaced by commerce, the nation mu&s;t be ha&s;tening
to a &s;tate of in&s;olvency. Over and above the&s;e proceed|ings
in this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, it may not be unnece&s;&s;ary
to mention &s;everal me&s;&s;ages which were &s;ent by the King
to the Hou&s;e of Commons. That relating to the vote of
credit we have already &s;pecified in our account of the Sup|ply.
On the twenty-&s;ixth day of April the Chancellor of
the Exchequer pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e two me&s;&s;ages,
&s;igned by his Maje&s;ty, one in favour of his &s;ubjects in
North-America, and the other in behalf of the Ea&s;t-India
company: the former recommending to their con&s;idera|tion
the zeal and vigour with which his faithful &s;ubjects in
North-America had exerted them&s;elves, in defence of his
ju&s;t rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; de&s;iring he might be enabled to
give them a proper compen&s;ation for the expen&s;es in|curred
by the re&s;pective provinces in levying, clothing,
and paying the troops rai&s;ed in that country, according as
the active vigour and &s;trenuous efforts of the &s;everal colo|nies
&s;hould appear to merit. In the latter, he de&s;ired the
Hou&s;e would empower him to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Ea&s;t-India com|pany
in defraying the expen&s;e of a military force in the
Ea&s;t-Indies, to be maintained by them, in lieu of a bat|talion
of regular troops withdrawn from thence, and re|turned
to Ireland. Both the&s;e me&s;&s;ages were referred to
the committee of &s;upply, and produced the re&s;olutions
<PB N="433" REF="437">
upon each &s;ubject which we have already explained. The
me&s;&s;age relating to a projected inva&s;ion by the enemies of
Great-Britain we &s;hall particulari&s;e in its proper place,
when we come to record the circum&s;tances and mi&s;carriage
of that de&s;ign. In the mean time, it may not be improper
to ob&s;erve, that the thanks of the Hou&s;e of Commons
were voted and given to Admiral Bo&s;cawen and Major-General
Amher&s;t, for the &s;ervices they had done their
king and country in North-America; and the &s;ame com|pliment
was paid to Admiral O&s;borne, for the &s;ucce&s;s of
his crui&s;e in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed on the &s;econd day
of June with a &s;peech to both Hou&s;es, from the com|mi&s;&s;ioners
appointed by his Maje&s;ty for that purpo&s;e. In
this harangue the parliament was given to under&s;tand,
that the King approved of their conduct, and returned
them his thanks for their conde&s;cen&s;ion; that the hopes
he had conceived of their &s;urmounting the difficulties
which lay in the way were founded on the wi&s;dom, zeal,
and affection of &s;o good a parliament; and that his ex|pectations
were fully an&s;wered; that they had con&s;idered
the war in all its parts, and notwith&s;tanding its long con|tinuance,
through the ob&s;tinacy of the enemy, had made
&s;uch provi&s;ion for the many different operations as ought
to convince the adver&s;aries of Great-Britain, that it would
be for their intere&s;t, as well as for the ea&s;e and relief of
all Europe, to embrace equitable and honourable terms of
accommodation. They were told that, by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
the combined army in Germany had been completed;
powerful &s;quadrons, as well as numerous bodies of land|forces,
were employed in America, in order to maintain
the Briti&s;h rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and annoy the enemy
in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner in that country: that, as
France was making con&s;iderable preparations in her dif|ferent
ports, he had taken care to put his &s;leet at home in
the be&s;t condition, both of &s;trength and &s;ituation, to guard
again&s;t and repel any attempts that might be meditated
again&s;t his kingdoms: that all his mea&s;ures had been
<PB N="434" REF="438">
directed to a&s;&s;ert the honour of his crown; to pre&s;erve
the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of his faithful &s;ubjects; to &s;upport
the cau&s;e of the prote&s;tant religion, and publick liberty:
he, therefore, tru&s;ted that the uprightne&s;s of his intentions
would draw down the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven upon his endea|vours.
He expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that the precautions they
had taken to prevent and correct the exce&s;&s;es of the pri|vateers
would produce the de&s;ired effect: a con&s;ideration
which the king had much at heart; for, though &s;en&s;ible
of the utility of that &s;ervice, when under proper regula|tions,
he was determined to do his utmo&s;t to prevent any
injuries or hard&s;hips which might be &s;u&s;tained by the &s;ub|jects
of neutral powers, as far as might be practicable and
con&s;i&s;tent with his Maje&s;ty's ju&s;t right to hinder the trade
of his enemies from being collu&s;ively and fraudulently
covered. He not only thanked the Commons, but ap|plauded
the firmne&s;s and vigour with which they had
acted, as well as their prudence in judging, that, notwith|&s;tanding
the pre&s;ent burthens, the making ample provi|&s;ion
for carrying on the war was the mo&s;t probable
means to bring it to an honourable and happy conclu&s;ion.
He a&s;&s;ured them that no attention &s;hould be wanting, on
his part, for the faithful application of what had been
granted. They were informed he had nothing fur|ther
to de&s;ire, but that they &s;hould carry down the &s;ame
good di&s;po&s;itions, and propagate them in their &s;everal
counties, which they had &s;hown in their proceedings dur|ing
the &s;e&s;&s;ion. The&s;e declarations being pronounced,
the parliament was prorogued.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. The people of England, provoked on one
hand by the intrigues, the ho&s;tilities, and menaces of
France, and animated on the other by the pride of tri|umph
and &s;ucce&s;s, which never fails to reconcile them to
difficulties, how&s;oever great, and expen&s;e, however enor|mous,
at this period breathed nothing but war, and di&s;|cour&s;ed
about nothing but new plans of conque&s;t. We
have &s;een how liberally the parliament be&s;towed the na|tion's
money; and the acquie&s;cence of the &s;ubjects in

general under the additional burthens which had been im|po&s;ed,
appeared in the remarkable eagerne&s;s with which
they embarked in the &s;ub&s;cription planned by the le|gi&s;lature;
in the vigorous a&s;&s;i&s;tance they contributed to|wards
manning the navy, recruiting the army, and le|vying
additional forces; and the warlike &s;pirit which be|gan
to diffu&s;e it&s;elf through all ranks of the people. This
was a &s;pirit which the mini&s;try carefully cheri&s;hed and
cultivated, for the &s;upport of the war, which, it mu&s;t be
owned, was pro&s;ecuted with an ardour and efficacy pecu|liar
to the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration. True it is, the Ger|man
mar had been for &s;ome time adopted as an object of
importance by the Briti&s;h councils, and a re&s;olution was
taken to maintain it without flinching: at the &s;ame time,
it mu&s;t be allowed, that this con&s;ideration had not hitherto
weakened the attention of the mini&s;try to the operations
in America, where alone the war may be &s;aid to have been
carried on and pro&s;ecuted on Briti&s;h principles, &s;o as to
di&s;tre&s;s the enemy in their mo&s;t tender part, and at the
&s;ame time acquire the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial advantages to the
&s;ubjects of Britain. For the&s;e two purpo&s;es, every pre|paration
was made that &s;agacity could &s;ugge&s;t, or vigour
execute. The navy was repaired and augmented, and in
order to man the different &s;quadrons, the expedient of
pre&s;&s;ing, that di&s;grace to a Briti&s;h admini&s;tration, was
practi&s;ed both by land and water with extraordinary rigour
and vivacity. A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, offering a con|&s;iderable
bounty for every &s;eaman and even landman that
&s;hould, by a certain day, enter voluntarily into the &s;ervice.
As an additional encouragement to this cla&s;s of people,
the King promi&s;ed his pardon to all &s;eamen who had de|&s;erted
from the re&s;pective &s;hips to which they belonged,
provided they &s;hould return to their duty by the third day of
July; but at the &s;ame time he declared, that tho&s;e who
&s;hould neglect this opportunity, at a time when their coun|try
&s;o much required their &s;ervice, would, upon being ap|prehended,
incur the penalty of a court-martial, and, if
convicted, be deemed unfit objects of the royal mercy.
<PB N="436" REF="440">
All ju&s;tices of the peace, mayors, and magi&s;trates of cor|porations
throughout Great-Britain were commanded to
make particular &s;earch for &s;traggling &s;eamen fit for the
&s;ervice, and to &s;end all that &s;hould be found to the neare&s;t
&s;ea-port, that they might be &s;ent on board by the &s;ea-officer
there commanding. Other methods more gentle
and effectual were taken to levy and recruit the land-forces.
New regiments were rai&s;ed, on his Maje&s;ty's pro|mi&s;e,
that every man &s;hould be entitled to his di&s;charge
at the end of three years, and the premiums for inli&s;ting
were increa&s;ed. Over and above the&s;e indulgences, con|&s;iderable
bounties were offered and given by cities, towns,
corporations, and even by individuals, &s;o univer&s;ally were
the people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a&s;pirit of chivalry and adventure.
The example was &s;ent by the metropolis, where the com|mon-council
re&s;olved that voluntary &s;ub&s;criptions &s;hould
be received in the chamber of London, to be appropriated
as bounty-money to &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hould engage in his
Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. The city &s;ub&s;cribed a con&s;iderable &s;um
for that purpo&s;e; and a committee of aldermen and com|moners
was appointed to attend at Guildhall, to receive
and apply the &s;ub&s;criptions. As a further encourage|ment
to volunteers, they moreover re&s;olved, that every
per&s;on &s;o entering &s;hould be entitled to the freedom of the
$ity, at the expiration of three years, or &s;ooner, if the war
&s;hould be brought to a conclu&s;ion. The&s;e re&s;olutions
being communicated to the King, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ig|nify
his approbation, and return his thanks to the city, in
a letter from the &s;ecretary of &s;tate to the Lord-Mayor.
Large &s;ums were immediately &s;ub&s;cribed by different com|panies,
and &s;ome private per&s;ons; and, in imitation of the
capital, bounties were offered by many different communi|ties
in every quarter of the united kingdom. At the &s;ame
time, &s;uch care and diligence were u&s;ed in di&s;ciplining the
militia, that, before the clo&s;e of the year, the greater part
of tho&s;e truely con&s;titutional battalions rivalled the regu|lar
troops in the perfection of their exerci&s;e, and &s;eemed
to be in all re&s;pects as fit for actual &s;ervice.</P>

&sect; XXX. Before we proceed to record the tran&s;actions
of the campaign that &s;uceeded the&s;e preparations, we &s;hall
take notice of &s;ome dome&s;tick events, which, though not
very important in them&s;elves, may neverthele&s;s claim a
place in the Hi&s;tory of England. In the beginning of the
year, the court of London was overwhelmed with af|fliction
at the death of the Prince&s;s Dowager of Orange
and Na&s;&s;au, governante of the United Provinces in the
minority of her &s;on, the pre&s;ent Stadtholder. She was the
elde&s;t daughter of his Britannick Maje&s;ty, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
many per&s;onal accompli&s;hments and exemplary virtues,
pious, moderate, &s;en&s;ible, and circum&s;pect. She had ex|erci&s;ed
her authority with equal &s;agacity and re&s;olution,
re&s;pected even by tho&s;e who were no friends to the hou&s;e
of Orange, and died with great fortitude and re&s;ignation.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Feeling her end approaching, &s;he delivered a key to one of her attend|ants, directing him to fetch two papers, which &s;he &s;igned with her own hand. One was a contract of marriage between her daughter and the Prince of Na&s;&s;au-Weilburg; the other was a letter to the States-General, be&s;e$ching them to con&s;ent to this marriage, and pre&s;erve inviolate the regulations &s;he had made, touching the education and tutelage of the young Stadtholder. The&s;e two papers being &s;igned and &s;ealed, &s;he &s;ent for her children, exhorted them to make proper improvements on the education they had received, and to live in harmony with each other. Then &s;he implored heaven to &s;hower its ble&s;&s;ings on them both, and embraced them with the mo&s;t affecting marks of maternal tenderne&s;s. She afterwards continued to conver&s;e calmly and de|liberately with her friends, and in a few hours expired.</NOTE>
In her will &s;he appointed the King her father, and the
Prince&s;s Dowager of Orange, her mother-in law, honorary
tutors, and Prince Louis of Brun&s;wick acting tutor to her
children. In the morning after her decea&s;e, the States-General,
and the States of Holland were extraordinarily
a&s;&s;embled, and having received notice of the event, pro|ceeded
to confirm the regulations which had been made
for the minority of the Stadtholder. Prince Louis of Brun&s;|wick
was invited to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the a&s;&s;embly of Holland, where
he took the oaths, as repre&s;enting the captain-general of the
union. Then he communicated to the a&s;&s;embly the act
by which the Prince&s;s had appointed him guardian of her
children. He was afterwards invited to the a&s;&s;embly of
<PB N="438" REF="442">
the States-General, who agreed to the re&s;olution of Holland
with re&s;pect to his guardian&s;hip; and in the evening,
the different colleges of the government &s;ent formal de|putations
to the young Stadtholder, and the Prince&s;s Caro|line,
his &s;i&s;ter, in who&s;e names and pre&s;ence they were re|ceived,
and an&s;wered by their guardian and repre&s;entative.
A formal intimation of the death of the Prince&s;s was
communicated to the King her father, in a pathetick letter,
by the States-General, who condoled with him on the
irreparable lo&s;s which he as well as they had &s;u&s;tained by
this melancholy event, and a&s;&s;ured him they would em|ploy
all their care and attention in &s;ecuring and defending
the rights and intere&s;ts of the young Stadtholder, and the
Prince&s;s his &s;i&s;ter, whom they con&s;idered as the children of
the republick. The royal family of England &s;uffered
another di&s;a&s;ter in the cour&s;e of this year, by the decea&s;e
of the Prince&s;s Eli&s;abeth-Caroline, &s;econd daughter of his
late Royal Highne&s;s Frederick Prince of Wales, a lady of
the mo&s;t amiable character, who died at Kew in the month
of September, before &s;he had attained the eighteenth year
of her age.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. Certain privateers continuing their exce&s;&s;es
at &s;ea, and rifling neutral &s;hips without di&s;tinction or au|thority,
the government re&s;olved to vindicate the honour
of the nation, by making examples of tho&s;e pirates, who,
as fa&s;t as they could be detected and &s;ecured, were brought
to trial, and upon conviction &s;acrificed to ju&s;tice. While
the&s;e &s;teps were taken to re&s;cue the nation from the re|proach
of violence and rapacity, which her neighbours
had urged with &s;uch eagerne&s;s, equal &s;pirit was exerted in
convincing neutral powers that they &s;hould not, with im|punity,
contravene the law of nations, in favouring the
enemies of Great-Britain. A great number of cau&s;es were
tried, relating to di&s;puted captures, and many Dutch
ve&s;&s;els, with their cargoes, were condemned after a fair
hearing, notwith&s;tanding the loud clamours of that peo|ple,
and the repeated remon&s;trances of the States-General.</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="443">
&sect; XXXII. The reputation of the Engli&s;h was not &s;o
much affected by the irregularities of her privateers, armed
for rapine, as by the neglect of internal police, and an in|gredient
of &s;avage ferocity mingled in the national cha|racter;
an ingredient that appeared but too con&s;picuous
in the particulars of &s;everal &s;hocking murthers brought to
light about this period.&mdash;One Hal&s;ey, who commanded a
merchant-&s;hip in the voyage from Jamaica to England,
having conceived &s;ome per&s;onal di&s;like to a poor &s;ailor,
in&s;ulted him with &s;uch abu&s;e, expo&s;ed him to &s;uch hard|&s;hips,
and puni&s;hed him with &s;uch wantonne&s;s of barbarity,
that the poor wretch leaped overboard in de&s;pair. His
inhuman tyrant envying him that death, which would
have re&s;cued a mi&s;erable object from his brutality, plunged
into the &s;ea after him, and brought him on board, de|claring
he &s;hould not e&s;cape &s;o while there were any tor|ments
left to inflict. Accordingly, he exerci&s;ed his ty|ranny
upon him with redoubled vigour, until the poor
creature expired, in con&s;equence of the inhuman treatment
he had &s;u&s;tained. This &s;avage ruffian was likewi&s;e indicted
for the murther of another mariner, but being convicted on
the fir&s;t trial, the &s;econd was found unnece&s;&s;ary, and the
criminal &s;uffered death, according to the law, which is
perhaps too mild to malefactors convicted of &s;uch aggra|vated
cruelty.&mdash;Another barbarous murther was perpe|trated
in the country, near Birmingham, upon a &s;heriff's
officer, by the &s;ons of one Darby, who&s;e effects the bailiff
had &s;ei&s;ed, on a di&s;tre&s;s &s;or rent. The two young a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins,
encouraged by the father, attacked the unhappy wretch
with clubs, and mangled him in a terrible manner, &s;o that
he hardly retained any &s;igns of life. Not contented with
this cruel execution, they &s;tripped him naked, and drag|ging
him out of the hou&s;e, &s;courged him with a wag|goner's
whip, until the fle&s;h was cut from his bones. In
this mi&s;erable condition he was found weltering in his
blood, and conveyed to a neighbouring hou&s;e, where he
immediately expired. The three barbarians were appre|hended,
after having made a de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance. They
<PB N="440" REF="444">
were tried, convicted, and executed: the &s;ons were hung
in chains, and the body of the father diffected.&mdash;The wi|dow
of a timber-merchant at Rotherhithe being cruelly
murthered in her own hou&s;e, Mary Edmon&s;on, a young
woman, her niece, ran out into the &s;treet with her own
arms cut acro&s;s, and gave the alarm, declaring her aunt had
been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by four men, who forced their way into
the hou&s;e, and that &s;he (the niece) had received tho&s;e
wounds, in attempting to defend her relation. According
to the circum&s;tances that appeared, this unnatural wretch
had cut the throat of her aunt and benefactre&s;s with a
ca&s;e-knife, then dragged the body from the wa&s;h-hou&s;e
to the parlour; that &s;he had &s;tolen a watch and &s;ome &s;ilver
&s;poons, and concealed them, together with the knife and
her own apron, which was &s;oaked with the blood of her
parent. After having acted this horrid tragedy, the bare
recital of which the humane reader will not peru&s;e without
horrour, &s;he put on another apron, and wounded her own
fle&s;h, the better to conceal her guilt. Notwith&s;tanding
the&s;e precautions &s;he was &s;u&s;pected, and committed to pri|&s;on.
Being brought to trial, &s;he was convicted and con|demned,
upon circum&s;tantial evidence, and finally executed
on Kennington-Common, though &s;he denied the fact to
the la&s;t moment of her life. At the place of execution &s;he
behaved with great compo&s;ure, and, after having &s;pent
&s;ome minutes in devotion, prote&s;ted &s;he was innocent
of the crime laid to her charge. What &s;eemed to cor|roborate
this prote&s;tation, was the condition and cha|racter
of the young woman, who had been educated in a
&s;phere above the vulgar, and maintained a reputation
without reproach in the country, where &s;he was actually
betrothed to a clergyman. On the other hand, the cir|cum&s;tances
that appeared again&s;t her almo&s;t amounted to a
certainty, though nothing weaker than proof po&s;itive ought
to determine a jury in capital ca&s;es to give a verdict again&s;t
the per&s;on accu&s;ed. After all, this is one of tho&s;e proble|matick
events which clude the force of all evidence, and
&s;erve to confound the pride of human rea&s;on.&mdash;A mi&s;|creant,
<PB N="441" REF="445">
who&s;e name was Haines, having e&s;pou&s;ed the daugh|ter
of a farmer in the neighbourhood of Glouce&s;ter, who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;mall e&s;tate, which he intended to divide among
&s;even children, was &s;o abandoned as to form the de&s;ign of
poi&s;oning the whole family, that by virtue of his wife he
might enjoy the whole inheritance. For the execution of
this infernal &s;cheme, he employed his own father to pur|cha&s;e
a quantity of ar&s;enick; part of which he admini&s;tered
to three of the children, who were immediately &s;ei&s;ed
with the dreadful &s;ymptoms produced by this mineral,
and the elde&s;t expired. He afterwards mixed it with three
apple-cakes, which he bought for the purpo&s;e, and pre|&s;ented
to the other three children, who underwent the
&s;ame violence of operation which had proved fatal to the
elde&s;t brother. The in&s;tantaneous effects of the poi&s;on
created a &s;u&s;picion of Haines, who being examined, the
whole &s;cene of villainy &s;tood di&s;clo&s;ed. Neverthele&s;s, the
villain found means to e&s;cape.&mdash;The uncommon &s;pirit of
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination which raged at this period &s;eemed to com|municate
it&s;elf even to foreigners who breathed Engli&s;h
air. Five French pri&s;oners, confined on board the King's
&s;hip the Royal Oak, were convicted of having murthered
one Jean de Manaux, their countryman and fellow pri|&s;oner,
in revenge for his having di&s;covered that they had
forged pa&s;&s;es to facilitate their e&s;cape. Exa&s;perated at this
detection, they &s;ei&s;ed this unfortunate informer in the
place of their confinement, gagged his mouth, &s;tripped
him naked, tied him with a &s;trong cord to a ring bolt, and
&s;courged his body with the mo&s;t brutal per&s;everance. By
dint of &s;truggling the poor wretch di&s;engaged him&s;elf from
the cord with which he had been tied: then they fini&s;hed
the tragedy, by leaping and &s;tamping on his brea&s;t, till the
che&s;t was broke, and he expired. They afterwards &s;evered
the body into &s;mall pieces, and the&s;e they conveyed at
different times into the &s;ea, through the funnel of a con|venience
to which they had acce&s;s; but one of the other
pri&s;oners gave information of the murther, in con&s;equence
of which they were &s;ecured, brought to trial, condemned,
<PB N="442" REF="446">
and puni&s;hed with death.&mdash;Nor were the in&s;tances of
cruel a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination which prevailed at this juncture confin|ed
to Great-Britain. At the latter end of the foregoing
year, an atrocious ma&s;&s;acre was perpetrated by two Ge|noe&s;e
mariners upon the ma&s;ter and crew of an Engli&s;h
ve&s;&s;el, among whom they were enrolled. The&s;e mon&s;ters
of cruelty were in different watches, a circum&s;tance that
favoured the execution of the horrid plan they had con|certed.
When one of them retired to re&s;t with his fellows
of the watch, con&s;i&s;ting of the mate and two &s;eamen, he
waited till they were fa&s;t a&s;leep, and then butchered them
all with a knife. Having &s;o far &s;ucceeded without di&s;|covery,
he returned to the deck, and communicated the
exploit to his a&s;&s;ociate: then they &s;uddenly attacked the
ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el, and cleft his head with a hatchet,
which they likewi&s;e u&s;ed in murthering the man that &s;tood
at the helm; a third was likewi&s;e di&s;patched, and no
Engli&s;hman remained alive but the ma&s;ter's &s;on, a boy,
who lamented his father's death with ince&s;&s;ant tears and
cries for three days, at the expiration of which he was
likewi&s;e &s;acrificed, becau&s;e the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were di&s;turbed by
his clamour. This barbarous &s;cene was acted within
&s;ixty leagues of the rock of Li&s;bon; but the ve&s;&s;el was
taken between the capes Ortugal and Fini&s;terre, by the
captain of a French privateer called La Favourite, who
&s;eeing the deck &s;tained with blood, and finding all the pa|pers
of the &s;hip de&s;troyed, began to &s;u&s;pect that the ma&s;ter
and crew had been murthered. He accordingly taxed them
with the murther, and they confe&s;&s;ed the particulars. The
privateer touched at Vigo, where the captain imparted
this detail to the Engli&s;h con&s;ul; but the prize, with the
two villains on board, was &s;ent to Bayonne in France,
where they were brought to condign puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. We &s;hall clo&s;e this regi&s;ter of blood with
the account of a murther remarkable in all its circum|&s;tances,
for which a per&s;on, called Eugene Aram, &s;uffered
at York, in the cour&s;e of this year. This man, who ex|erci&s;ed
the profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;choolma&s;ter at Knare&s;borough,
<PB N="443" REF="447">
had, as far back as the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and forty-five, been concerned with one Hou&s;eman, in
robbing and murthering Daniel Clarke, whom they had
previou&s;ly per&s;uaded to borrow a con&s;iderable quantity of
valuable effects from different per&s;ons in the neighbourhood
on fal&s;e pretences, that he might retire with the booty.
He had accordingly filled a &s;ack with the&s;e particulars,
and began his retreat with his two perfidious a&s;&s;ociates,
who &s;uddenly fell upon him, deprived him of life, and,
having buried the body in a cave, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
plunder. Though Clarke di&s;appeared at once in &s;uch a
my&s;terious manner, no &s;u&s;picion fell upon the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins;
and Aram, who was the chief contriver and agent in the
murther, moved his habitation to another part of the
country. In the &s;ummer of the pre&s;ent year, Hou&s;eman
being employed, among other labourers, in repairing the
publick highway, they, in digging for gravel by the road
&s;ide, di&s;covered the &s;keleton of a human creature, which
the majority &s;uppo&s;ed to be the bones of Daniel Clarke.
This opinion was no &s;ooner broached, than Hou&s;eman,
as it were by &s;ome &s;upernatural impul&s;e which he could
not re&s;i&s;t, declared that it was not the &s;keleton of Clarke,
ina&s;much as his body had been interred in a place called
St. Robert's Cave, where they would find it, with the
head turned to a certain corner. He was immediately
apprehended, examined, admitted as evidence for the
crown, and di&s;covered the particulars of the murther.
The &s;keleton of Clarke being found exactly in the place
and manner he had de&s;cribed, Eugene Aram, who now
acted as u&s;her to a grammar-&s;chool in the county of
Norfolk, was &s;ecured, and brought to trial at the York
a&s;&s;i&s;es. There, his own wi&s;e corroborating the te&s;timony
of Hou&s;eman, he was found guilty, and received &s;entence
of death, not with&s;tanding a very artful and learned defence,
in which he proved, from argument and example, the
danger of convicting a man upon circum&s;tantial evidence.
Finding all his remon&s;trances ineffectual, he recommended
him&s;elf in pathetick terms to the King's mercy; and if
<PB N="444" REF="448">
ever murther was entitled to indulgence, perhaps it might
have been extended, not improperly, to this man, who&s;e
genius, in it&s;elf prodigious, might have exerted it&s;elf in
works of general utility. He had, in &s;pite of all the di&s;|advantages
attending low birth and &s;traitened circum|&s;tances,
by the dint of his own capacity and inclination,
made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in mathematicks and philo&s;o|phy,
acquired all the languages ancient and modern, and
executed part of a Celtick dictionary, which, had he lived
to fini&s;h it, might have thrown &s;ome e&s;&s;ential light upon
the origin and ob&s;curities of the European Hi&s;tory. Con|vinced,
at la&s;t, that he had nothing to hope from the cle|mency
of the government, he wrote a &s;hort poem in de|fence
of &s;uicide; and, on the day fixed for his execution,
opened the veins of his left arm with a razor, which he
had concealed for that purpo&s;e. Though he was much
weakened by the effu&s;ion of blood, before this attempt
was di&s;covered; yet, as the in&s;trument had mi&s;&s;ed the
artery, he did not expire until he was carried to the gibbet,
and underwent the &s;entence of the law. His body was
conveyed to Knare&s;borough-fore&s;t, and hung in chains,
near the place where the murther was perpetrated.
The&s;e are &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable that appeared
among many other in&s;tances of homicide; a crime that
prevails to a degree alike deplorable and &s;urpri&s;ing, even
in a nation renowned for compa&s;&s;ion and placability.
But this will generally be the ca&s;e among people who&s;e
pa&s;&s;ions, naturally impetuous, are ill re&s;trained, by laws,
and the regulations of civil &s;ociety, which the licentious
do not fear, and the wicked hope to evade.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. The Prince of Wales having, in the be|ginning
of June, entered the two-and-twentieth year of
his age, the anniver&s;ary of his birth was celebrated with
great rejoicings at court, and the King received com|pliments
of congratulation on the majority of a prince,
who &s;eemed born to fulfill the hopes and complete the
happine&s;s of Great-Britain. The city of London pre|&s;ented
an addre&s;s to the King on this occa&s;ion, replete

with expre&s;&s;ions of loyalty and affection, a&s;&s;uring his Ma|je&s;ty,
that no ho&s;tile threats could intimidate a people
animated by the love of liberty, who. confiding in the
Divine Providence, and in his Maje&s;ty's experienced
wi&s;dom and vigorous councils, were re&s;olved to exert
their utmo&s;t efforts towards enabling their &s;overeign to
repel the in&s;ults and defeat the attempts made by the an|cient
enemies of his crown and kingdom. Congratu|lations
of the &s;ame kind were offered by other cities,
towns, corporations, and communities, who vied with
each other in profe&s;&s;ions of attachment; and, indeed,
there was not the lea&s;t trace of di&s;affection perceivable at
this juncture in any part of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. So little were the citizens of London di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed
by the expen&s;e, or incommoded by the operations
of the war, that they found lei&s;ure to plan, and funds to
execute magnificent works of art, for the ornament of the
metropolis, and the convenience of commerce. They
had obtained an act of parliament, empowering them to
build a new bridge over the Thames, from Black-friars
to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, about midway between tho&s;e of
London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. Commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed
to put this act in execution; and, at a court of common-council,
it was re&s;olved that a &s;um not exceeding one
hundred and forty-four thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be forth|with
rai&s;ed, within the &s;pace of eight years, by in&s;tall|ments,
not exceeding thirty-thou&s;and pounds in one year,
to be paid into the chamber of London; that the per&s;ons
advancing the money &s;hould have an intere&s;t at the rate
of four pounds per cent. per annum, to be paid half yearly
by the Chamberlain, yet redeemable at the expiration of
the fir&s;t ten years; and that the Chamberlain &s;hould affix
the city's &s;eal to &s;uch in&s;truments as the committee might
think &s;it to give for &s;ecuring the payment of the &s;aid
annuities. Such were the fir&s;t effectual &s;teps taken to|wards
the execution of a laudable mea&s;ure, which met
with the mo&s;tob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition in the &s;equel, from the
<PB N="446" REF="450">
narrow views of particular people, as well as from the
prejudice of party.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. The &s;pirit that now animated the citizens
of London was &s;uch as &s;mall difficulties did not retard,
and even con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es could not di&s;courage. In the
month of November the city was expo&s;ed to a dangerous
conflagration, kindled in the night by accident in the
neighbourhood of the Royal-Exchange, which burned
with great fury, notwith&s;tanding the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the fire|men
and engines employed under the per&s;onal direction
of the magi&s;tracy, con&s;umed a good number of hou&s;es, and
damaged many more. That whole quarter of the town
was filled with con&s;ternation: &s;ome individuals were beg|gared;
one or two peri&s;hed in the flames, and &s;ome were
buried in the ruins of the hou&s;es that &s;unk under the di&s;|a&s;ter.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. The &s;erment of mind &s;o peculiar to the
natives of Great-Britain, excited by a &s;trange mixture of
genius and caprice, pa&s;&s;ion and philo&s;ophy, &s;tudy and
conjecture, pruduced at this period &s;ome flowers of im|provement,
in different arts and &s;ciences, that &s;eemed to
promi&s;e fruit of publick utility. Several per&s;ons invented
methods for di&s;covering the longitude at &s;ea, that great
<HI>de&s;ideratum</HI> in navigation, for the a&s;certainment of which
&s;o many nations have offered a publick recompen&s;e, and
in the inve&s;tigation of which &s;o many mathematical heads
have been di&s;ordered. Some of tho&s;e who now appeared
candidates for the prize de&s;erved encouragement for the
ingenuity of their &s;everal &s;y&s;tems; but he who &s;eemed to
enjoy the pre-eminence in the opinion and favour of the
publick, was Mr. Irwin, a native of Ireland, who con|trived
a chair &s;o artfully poi&s;ed, that a per&s;on &s;itting in it
on board a &s;hip, even in a rough &s;ea, can, through a
tele&s;cope, ob&s;erve the immer&s;ion and emer&s;ion of Jupi|ter's
&s;atellites, without being interrupted or incommoded
by the motion of the ve&s;&s;el. This gentleman was favour|ed
with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection of Commodore Lord
Howe, in who&s;e pre&s;ence the experiment was tried in
<PB N="447" REF="451">
&s;everal &s;hips at &s;ea with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that he granted a
certificate, &s;ignifying his approbation; and in con&s;equence
of this, Mr. Irwin is &s;aid to have obtained a con&s;iderable
reward from the board of Admiralty.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The people of England, happy in their
&s;ituation, felt none of the &s;torms of war and de&s;olation
which ravaged the neighbouring countries; but, enriched
by a &s;urpri&s;ing augmentation of commerce, enjoyed all the
&s;ecurity of peace, and all the plea&s;ures of ta&s;te, and afflu|ence.
The univer&s;ity of Oxford having conferred the
office of their chancellor, vacant by the death of the Earl
of Arran, upon another nobleman of equal honour and
integrity, namely, the Earl of We&s;tmorland, he made a
publick entrance into that celebrated &s;eat of learning with
great magnificence, and was in&s;talled amid&s;t the Encaenia,
which were celebrated with &s;uch cla&s;&s;ical elegance of pomp,
as might have rivalled the chief Roman fe&s;tival of the
Augu&s;tan age. The chancellor elect was attended by a
&s;plendid train of the nobility and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction.
The city of Oxford was filled with a va&s;t concour&s;e of
&s;trangers. The proce&s;&s;ions were contrived with ta&s;te,
and conducted with decorum. The in&s;tallation was per|formed
with the mo&s;t &s;triking &s;olemnity. The congratu|latory
ver&s;es, and publick &s;peeches, breathed the &s;pirit
of old Rome; and the ceremony was clo&s;ed by Dr. King,
that venerable &s;age of St. Mary Hall, who pronounced an
oration in prai&s;e of the new chancellor with all the flow of
Tully, animated by the fire of Demo&s;thenes.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. We &s;hall conclude the remarkable incidents
of this year<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>In the &s;pring of this year the liberal arts &s;u&s;tained a lamentable lo&s;s in the death of George Frederick Handel, the mo&s;t celebrated ma&s;ter in mu&s;ick which this age had produced. He was by birth a German; but had &s;tudied in Italy, and afterwards &s;ettled in England, where he met with the mo&s;t favourable reception, and re&s;ided above half a century, univer&s;ally admired for his &s;tupendous genius in the &s;ublime parts of mu&s;ical compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>One would be apt to imagine that there was &s;omething in the con&s;titution of the air at this period, which was particularly unfavourable to old age, ina&s;much as, in the compa&s;s of a few months, the following per&s;ons, remark|able for their longevity, died in the kingdom of Scotland: William Barnes, who had been above &s;eventy years a &s;ervant in the family of Brodie, died there, at the age of one hundred and nine. Catharine Mackenzie died in Ro&s;s-&s;hire, at the age of one hundred and eighteen. Janet Blair, decea&s;ed at Monemu&s;k, in the &s;hire of Aberdeen, turned of one hundred and twelve. Alexander Stephens, in Bam&s;f&s;hire, at the age of one hundred and eight. Janet Harper, at Bains-hole, at the age of one hundred and &s;even. Daniel Cameron, in Rannach, married when he was turned of one hundred, and &s;urvived his marriage thirty years.</P></NOTE>, that are detached from the pro&s;ecution of
<PB N="448" REF="452">
the war, with the detail of an event equally &s;urpri&s;ing
and deplorable:&mdash;A &s;loop called the dolphin, bound from
the Canaries to New-York, met with &s;uch un&s;avourable
weather, that &s;he was detained onehundred and &s;ixty-five
days in the pa&s;&s;age, and the provi&s;ion of the &s;hip was al|together
expended before the fir&s;t fifty days were elap&s;ed.
The wretched crew had devoured their dog, cat, and all
their &s;hoes on board: at length, being reduced to the ut|mo&s;st
extremity, they agreed to ca&s;t lots for their lives,
that the body of him upon whom the lot &s;hould fall
might &s;ervefor &s;ome time to &s;port the &s;urvivors. The
wretched victim was one Antonio Galatia, a Spani&s;h
gentleman and pa&s;&s;enger. Him they &s;hot with a mu&s;quet;
and having cut off his head, threw it overboard; but the
entrails, and the re&s;t of the carca&s;e, they greedily devour|ed.
This horrid banquet having, as it were, fle&s;hed the
fami&s;hed crew, they began to talk of another &s;acrifice,
from which, however, they were diverted by the influ|ence
and remon&s;trances of their captain, who prevailed
upon them to be &s;atisfied with a mi&s;erable allowance to
each per diem, cut from a pair of leather breeches found
in the cabbin. Upon this calamitous pittance, re-en|forced
with the gra&s;s which grew plentifully upon the
deck, the&s;e poor objects made &s;hift to &s;ubfit&s;t for twenty
days, at the expiration of which they were relieved, and
taken on board one Captain Brad&s;haw, who chanced to
fall in which them at &s;ea. By this time the whole crew,
con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even men, were &s;o &s;qualid and emaciated,
as to exhibit an appearance at once piteous and terrible;
and &s;o reduced in point of &s;trength, that it was found
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;se ropes and tackle for hoi&s;ting them from
<PB N="449" REF="453">
one &s;hip to the other. The circum&s;tance of the lot
falling upon the Spaniard, who was the only foreigner on
board, encourages a &s;u&s;picion that foul play was offered to
this unfortunate &s;tranger; but the mo&s;t remarkable part of
this whole incident is, that the ma&s;ter and crew could not
contrive &s;ome &s;ort of tackle to catch fi&s;h, with which the
&s;ea every where abounds, and which, no doubt, might
be caught with the help of a little ingenuity. If im|plements
of this kind were provided in every &s;hip, they
would probably prevent all tho&s;e tragical events at &s;ea
that are occa&s;ioned by famine.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. Previous to the more capital operations in war, we
&s;hall particulari&s;e the mo&s;t remarkable captures that were
made upon the enemy by &s;ingle &s;hips of war, during the
cour&s;e of this &s;ummer and autumn. In the month of
February a French privateer belonging to Granville,
called the Marquis de Marigny, having on board near
two hundred men, and mounted with twenty cannon, was
taken by Captain Parker, commander of his Maje&s;ty's
&s;hip the Montague; who likewi&s;e made prize of a &s;maller
armed ve&s;&s;el, from Dunkirk, of eight cannon and &s;ixty
men. About the &s;ame period, Captain Graves, of the
Unicorn, brought in the Moras privateer of St. Maloes,
carrying two hundred men, and two-and-twenty cannon.
Two large merchant-&s;hips, loaded on the French King's
account for Martinique, with provi&s;ion, clothing, and
arms, for the troops on that i&s;land, were taken by Cap|tain
Lendrick, commander of the Brilliant; and an Eng|li&s;h
tran&s;port from St. John's, having four hundred
French pri&s;oners on board, peri&s;hed near the We&s;tern
I&s;lands. Within the circle of the &s;ame month, a large
French &s;hip from St. Domingo, richly laden, fell in with
the Favourite &s;hip of war, and was carried into Gib|raltar.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. In the month of February, Captain Hood, of
his Maje&s;ty's frigate of Ve&s;tal, belonging to a &s;mall
&s;quadron commanded by Admiral Holmes, who had &s;ailed
for the We&s;t-Indies in January, being advance a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="450" REF="454">
way a-head of the fleet, de&s;cried and gave cha&s;e
to a &s;ail, which proved to be a French frigate called the
Bellona, of two hundred and twenty men, and two-and-thirty
great guns, commanded by the Count de Beauho|noire.
Captain Hood, having made a &s;ignal to the Ad|miral,
continued the cha&s;e until he advanced within half
mu&s;quet-&s;hot of the enemy, and then poured in a broad|&s;ide,
which was immediately retorted. The engagement
thus begun was maintained with great vigour on both
&s;ides for the &s;pace of four hours; at the expiration of
which the Bellona &s;truck, after having lo&s;t all her ma&s;ts
and rigging, together with about forty men killed in the
action. Nor was the victor in a much better condition.
Thirty men were killed and wounded on board the Ve&s;tal.
Immediately after the enemy &s;ubmitted, all her rigging
being de&s;troyed by the &s;hot, the topma&s;ts fell overboard;
and &s;he was otherwi&s;e &s;o damaged, that &s;he could not pro|ceed
on her voyage. Captain Hood, therefore, returned
with his prize to Spithead; and afterwards met with a
gracious reception from his Maje&s;ty, on account of the
valour and conduct he had di&s;played on this occa&s;ion.
The Bellona had &s;ailed in January from the i&s;land of
Martinique, along with the Flori&s;&s;ant, and another French
frigate, from which &s;he had been &s;eparated in the pa&s;&s;age.
Immediately after this exploit, Captain Elliot, of the
Aeolus frigate, accompanied by the I&s;is, made prize of a
French &s;hip, the Mignonne, of twenty guns, and one hun|dred
and forty men, one of four frigates employed as con|voy
to a large fleet of merchant-&s;hips, near the i&s;land of
Rh&eacute;e.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. In the month of March, the Engli&s;h frigates
the Southampton and Melampe, commanded by the Cap|tains
Gilchri&s;t and Hotham, being at &s;ea to the northward
on a cruife, fell in with the Dana&euml;, a French &s;hip of forty
cannon, and three hundred and thirty men, which was
engaged by Captain Hotham in a &s;hip of half the force,
who maintained the battle a con&s;iderable time with admira|ble
gallantry, before his con&s;ort could come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
As they &s;ought in the dark, Captain Gilchri&s;t was obliged
<PB N="451" REF="455">
to lie by for &s;ome time, becau&s;e he could not di&s;tingui&s;h
the one from the other; but no &s;ooner did the day appear
than he bore down upon the Dana&euml; with his u&s;ual impe|tuo&s;ity,
and &s;oon compelled her to &s;urrender: &s;he did not
&s;trike, however, until thirty or forty of her men were
&s;tain: and the gallant Captain Gilchri&s;t received a grape|&s;hot
in his &s;houlder, which, though it did not deprive him
of life, yet rendered him incapable of future &s;ervice: a
misfortune the more to be lamented, as it happened to a
brave officer in the vigour of his age, and in the mid&s;t of
a &s;anguinary war, which might have afforded him many
other opportunities of &s;ignalizing his courage for the
honour and advantage of his country. Another remark|able
exploit was atchieved about the &s;ame juncture by
Captain Barrington, commander of the &s;hip Achilles,
mounted with &s;ixty cannon, who, to the we&s;tward of
Cape Fini&s;tere, encountered a French &s;hip of equal force,
called the Count de St. Florentin, bound from Cape
Francois on the i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola to Rochefort, under
the command of the Sieur de Montay, who was obliged to
&s;trike, after a clo&s;e and ob&s;tinate engagement, in which he
him&s;elf was mortally wounded, a great number of his men
&s;lain, and his &s;hip &s;o damaged, that &s;he was with diffi|culty
brought into Falmouth. Captain Barrington ob|tained
the victory at the expen&s;e of about five-and-twenty
men killed and wounded, and all his rigging, which the
enemy's &s;hot rendered u&s;ele&s;s. Two &s;mall privateers from
Dunkirk were al&s;o taken, one called the Marquis de Bareil,
by the Brilliant, which carried her into Kin&s;ale in Ireland;
the other called the Carilloneur, which &s;truck to the Grace
cutter, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the boats of the &s;hip Roche&s;ter, com|manded
by Captain Duff, who &s;ent her into the Downs.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. About the latter end of March, Captain
Samuel Falkner, in the &s;hip Wind&s;or, of &s;ixty guns,
crui&s;ing to the we&s;tward, di&s;covered four large &s;hips to
leeward, which, when he approached them, formed the
line of battle a-head, in order to give him a warm re|ception.
He accordingly clo&s;ed with the &s;ternmo&s;t &s;hip,
<PB N="452" REF="456">
which &s;u&s;tained his fire about an hour: then the other
three bearing away with all the &s;ail they could carry, &s;he
&s;truck her colours, and was conducted to Li&s;bon. She
proved to be the Duc de Chartres, pierced for &s;ixty cannon,
though at that time carrying no more than four-and-twenty,
with a complement of three hundred men, about
thirty of whom were killed in the action. She belonged,
with the other three that e&s;caped, to the French Ea&s;t-India
company, was loaded with gunpowder and naval
&s;tores, and bound for Pondicherry. Two privateers,
called La Cha&s;&s;eur and Le Conquerant, the one from
Dunkirk, and the other from Cherbourg, were taken and
caaried into Plymouth by Captain Hughes, of his Maje&s;ty's
frigate the Tamer. A third, called the De&s;patch, from
Morlaix, was brought into Penzance by the Diligence
&s;loop, under the command of Captain Ea&s;twood. A
fourth, called the Ba&s;que, from Bayonne, furni&s;hed with
two-and-twenty guns, and above two hundred men, fell
into the hands of Captain Parker, of the Brilliant, who
conveyed her into Plymouth. Captain Antrobus, of the
Surpri&s;e, took the Vieux, a privateer of Bourdeaux:
and a fifth, from Dunkirk, &s;truck to Captain Knight, of
the Liverpool, off Yarmouth. In the month of May a
French frigate, called the Arethu&s;a, mounted with two-and-thirty
cannon, manned with a large complement of
hands, under the command of the Marquis de Vaudri|eul,
&s;ubmitted to two Briti&s;h frigates, the Venus and the
Thames, commanded by the Captains Harri&s;on and Colby,
after a warm engagement, in which &s;ixty men were killed
and wounded on the &s;ide of the enemy. In the begin|ning
of June an armed &s;hip, belonging to Dunkirk, was
brought into the Downs, by Captain Angel, of the Stag;
and a privateer of force, called the Countefs de la Serre,
was &s;ubdued and taken, after an ob&s;tinate action, by Cap|tain
Moore, of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Adventure.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. Several armed &s;hips of the enemy, and rich
prizes, were taken in the We&s;t-Indies, particularly two
French frigates, and two Dutch &s;hips with French com|modities,
<PB N="453" REF="457">
all richly laden, by &s;ome of the &s;hips of the
&s;quadron which Vice-Admiral Cotes commanded on the
Jamaica &s;tation. A fifth, called the Velour, from St.
Domingo, with a valuable cargo on board, being fortified
with twenty cannon, and above one hundred men, fell in
with the Favourite &s;loop of war, under the command of
Captain Edwards, who, after an ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, carried
her in triumph to Gibraltar. At St. Chri&s;topher's, in
the We&s;t-Indies, Captain Collingwood, commander of
the king's &s;hip the Cre&s;cent, attacked two French frigates,
the Amethy&s;te and Berkeley; the former of which e&s;caped,
after a warm engagement, in which the Cre&s;cent's rigging
was &s;o much damaged, that &s;he could not pur&s;ue: but the
other was taken, and conveyed into the harbour of Ba&s;&s;e|terre.
Notwith&s;tanding the vigilance and courage of the
Engli&s;h crui&s;ers in tho&s;e &s;eas, the French privateers
&s;warmed to &s;uch a degree, that in the cour&s;e of this year
they took above two hundred &s;ail of Briti&s;h &s;hips, valued
at &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. This their
&s;ucce&s;s is the more remarkable, as by this time the i&s;land
of Guadaloupe was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, and Com|modore
Moore commanded a numerous &s;quadron in
tho&s;e very latitudes.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. In the beginning of October, the Hercules
&s;hip of war, mounted with &s;eventy-four guns, under the
command of Captain Porter, crui&s;ing in the chops of the
Channel, de&s;cried to windward a large &s;hip, which proved
to be the Flori&s;&s;ant, of the &s;ame force with the Hercules.
Her commander, perceiving the Engli&s;h &s;hip giving cha&s;e,
did not &s;eem to decline the action; but bore down upon
her in a &s;lanting direction, and the engagement began
with great fury. In a little time, the Hercules having
lo&s;t her top-ma&s;t, and all her rigging being &s;hot away,
the enemy took advantage of this di&s;a&s;ter, made the be&s;t
of his way, and was pur&s;ued till eight o'clock next morn|ing,
when the e&s;caped behind the i&s;le of Oleron. Captain
Porter was wounded in the head with a grape-&s;hot, and
lost the u&s;e of one leg in the engagement.</P>
<P><PB N="454" REF="458">
&sect; XLVI. Having taken notice of all the remarkable
captures and exploits that were made and atchieved by
&s;ingle &s;hips &s;ince the commencement of the pre&s;ent year,
we &s;hall now proceed to de&s;cribe the actions that were
performed in this period by the different &s;quadrons that
con&s;tituted the naval power of Great-Britain. Intelli|gence
having been received that the enemy meditated an
inva&s;ion upon &s;ome of the Briti&s;h territories, and that a
number of flat-bottomed boats were prepared at Havre-de-Grace,
for the purpo&s;e of di&s;embarking troops, Rear-Admiral
Rodney was, in the beginning of July, detached
with a &s;mall &s;quadron of &s;hips and bombs to annoy and
overawe that part of the coa&s;t of France. He accordingly
anchored in the road of Havre, and made a di&s;po&s;ition to
execute the in&s;tructions he had received. The bomb
ve&s;&s;els being placed in the narrow channel of the river
leading to Honfleur, began to throw their &s;hells, and
continued the bombardment for two-and-fifty hours,
without intermi&s;&s;ion, during which a numerous body of
French troops was employed in throwing up entrench|ments,
erecting new batteries, and firing both with &s;hot
and &s;hells upon the a&s;&s;ailants. The town was &s;et on fire
in &s;everal places, and burned with great fury; &s;ome of
the boats were overturned, and a few of them reduced to
a&s;hes, while the inhabitants for&s;ook the place in the ut|mo&s;t
con&s;ternation: neverthele&s;s, the damage done to the
enemy was too incon&s;iderable to make amends for the
expen&s;e of the armament, and the lo&s;s of nineteen hun|dred
&s;hells and eleven hundred carca&s;&s;es, which were ex|pended
in this expedition. Bombardments of this kind
are at be&s;t but expen&s;ive and unprofitable operations,
and may be deemed a barbarous method of pro&s;ecuting
war, ina&s;much as the damage falls upon the wretched in|habitants,
who have given no cau&s;e of offence, and who
are generally &s;pared by an humane enemy, unle&s;s they
have committed &s;ome particular act of provocation.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVII. The honour of the Briti&s;h flag was much
more effectually a&s;&s;erted by the gallant Admiral Bo&s;cawen.
<PB N="455" REF="459">
who, as we have already ob&s;erved, was entru&s;ted with the
conduct of a &s;quadron in the Mediterranean. It mu&s;t be
owned, however, that his fir&s;t attempt favoured of temerity.
Having in vain di&s;played the Briti&s;h flag in &s;ight of Tou|lon,
by way of defiance to the French fleet that lay there
at anchor, he ordered three &s;hips of the line, commanded
by the Captains Smith, Harland, and Barker, to advance
and burn two &s;hips that lay clo&s;e to the mouth of the
harbour. They accordingly approached with great intre|pidity,
and met with a very warm reception from divers
batteries which they had not before perceived. Two
&s;mall forts they attempted to de&s;troy, and cannonaded for
&s;ome time with great fury; but being over-matched by
&s;uperior force, and the wind &s;ub&s;iding into a calm, they
&s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage, and were towed off with
great difficulty, in a very &s;hattered condition. The Ad|miral
&s;eeing three of his be&s;t &s;hips &s;o roughly handled in
this enterpri&s;e, returned to Gibraltar in order to refit; and
M. de la Clue, the French commander of the &s;quadron at
Toulon, &s;ei&s;ed this opportunity of &s;ailing, in hopes of
pa&s;&s;ing the Straits mouth unob&s;erved, his fleet con&s;i&s;ting
of twelve large &s;hips, and three frigates. Admiral Bo&s;|cawen,
who commanded fourteen &s;ail of the line, with
two frigates, and as many fire-&s;hips, having refitted his
&s;quadron, detached one frigate to crui&s;e off Malaga, and
another to hover between E&s;tepona and Ceuta-point;
with a view to keep a good look-out, and give timely no|tice
in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould approach. On the &s;even|teenth
day of Augu&s;t, at eight in the evening, the Gibral|tar
frigate made a &s;ignal that fourteen &s;ail appeared on the
Barbary &s;hore, to the ea&s;tward of Ceuta; upon which the
Engli&s;h admiral immediately heaved up his anchors and
went to &s;ea: at day-light he de&s;cried &s;even large &s;hips
lying to; but when the Engli&s;h &s;quadron forebore to an|&s;wer
their &s;ignal, they di&s;covered their mi&s;take, &s;et all their
&s;ails, and made the be&s;t of their way. This was the
greater part of the French &s;quadron commanded by M. de
la Clue, from whom five of his large &s;hips and three fri|gates
<PB N="456" REF="460">
gates had &s;eparated in the night. Even now, perhaps, he
might have e&s;caped, had he not been obliged to wait for
the Souveraine, which was a heavy &s;ailer. At noon the
wind, which had blown a fre&s;h gale, died away, and al|though
Admiral Bo&s;cawen had made &s;ignal to cha&s;e, and
engage in a line of battle a-head, it was not till half an
hour after two that &s;ome of his headmo&s;t &s;hips could clo&s;e
with the rere of the enemy; which, though greatly out-numbered,
fought with uncommon bravery. The Eng|li&s;h
admiral, without waiting to return the fire of the
&s;ternmo&s;t, which he received as he pa&s;&s;ed, u&s;ed all his en|deavours
to come up with the Ocean, which M. de la
Clue commanded in per&s;on; and about four o'clock in
the afternoon running athwart her haw&s;e, poured into her
a furious broad&s;ide: thus the engagement began with
equal vigour on both &s;ides. This di&s;pute, however, was of
&s;hort duration. In about half an hour Admiral Bo&s;|cawen's
mizen-ma&s;t and top&s;ail yards were &s;hot away;
and the enemy hoi&s;ted all the &s;ail they could carry. Mr.
Bo&s;cawen having &s;hifted his flag from the Namur to the
Newark, joined &s;ome other &s;hips in attacking the Centaur,
of &s;eventy-four guns, which, being thus overpowered,
was obliged to &s;urrender. The Briti&s;h admiral pur&s;ued
them all night, during which the Souveraine, and the
Guerrier, altered their cour&s;e, and de&s;erted their command|er.
At day-break, M. de la Clue, who&s;e left leg had
been broke in the engagement, perceiving the Engli&s;h
&s;quadron crowding all their &s;ails to come up with him,
and finding him&s;elf on the coa&s;t of Portugal, determined to
burn his &s;hips, rather than they &s;hould fall into the hands
of the victors. The Ocean was run a&s;hore two leagues
from Lagos, near the fort of Almadana, the commander
of which fired three &s;hot at the Engli&s;h; another cap|tain
of the French &s;quadron followed the example of his
commander, and both endeavoured to di&s;embark their men;
but the &s;ea being rough, this proved a very tedious and
difficult attempt. The captains of the Temeraire and
Mode&s;te, in&s;tead of de&s;troying their &s;hips, anchored as
<PB N="457" REF="461">
near as they could to the forts Xavier and Lagres, in hopes
of enjoying their protection; but in this hope they were
di&s;appointed. M. de la Clue had been landed, and the
command of the Ocean was left to the Count de Carne,
who, having received one broad&s;ide from the America,
&s;truck his colours, and the Engli&s;h took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
this noble prize, the be&s;t &s;hip in the French navy, mount|ed
with eighty cannon. Captain Bently, of the War|&s;pight,
who had remarkably &s;ignalifed him&s;elf by his courage
during the action of the preceding day, attacked the Te|meraire,
of &s;eventy-four guns, and brought her off with
little damage. Vice-Admiral Broderick, the &s;econd in
command, advancing with his divi&s;ion, burned the Re|doubtable,
of &s;eventy-four guns, which was bulged, and
abandoned by her men and officers; but they made prize
of the Mode&s;te, carrying &s;ixty-four guns, which had not
been much injured in the engagement. This victory was
obtained by the Engli&s;h admiral at a very &s;mall expen&s;e of
men; the whole number of the killed and wounded not
exceeding two hundred and fifty on board of the Briti&s;h
&s;quadron, though the carnage among the enemy mu&s;t
have been much more con&s;iderable, as M. de la Clue, in
his letter to the French amba&s;&s;ador at Li&s;bon, owned that
on board of his own &s;hip, the Ocean, one hundred men
were killed on the &s;pot, and &s;eventy dangerou&s;ly wounded:
but the mo&s;t &s;evere circum&s;tance of this di&s;a&s;ter was the
lo&s;s of four capital &s;hips, two of which were de&s;troyed,
and the other two brought in triumph to England, to be
numbered among the be&s;t bottoms of the Briti&s;h navy.
What augmented the good fortune of the victors, was,
that not one officer lo&s;t his life in the engagement.
Captain Bently, whom the Admiral di&s;patched to Eng|land
with the tidings of his &s;ucce&s;s, met with a gracious
reception from the King, who knighted him for his
gallantry.</P>
<P>XLVIII. As we propo&s;e to throw together all the naval
tran&s;actions of the year, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that happened in
the European &s;eas, that they may be comprehended as it
<PB N="458" REF="462">
were in one view, we mu&s;t now, without regarding the
order of time, po&s;tpone many previous events of import|ance,
and record the la&s;t action by &s;ea that in the cour&s;e
of this year di&s;tingui&s;hed the flag of Great-Britain. The
court of Ver&s;ailles, in order to embarra&s;s the Briti&s;h
mini&s;try, and divert their attention from all external
expeditions, had in the winter projected a plan for invad|ing
&s;ome part of the Briti&s;h dominions; and in the begin|ning
of the year had actually begun to make preparations
on different parts of their coa&s;t for carrying this de&s;ign into
execution. Even as far back as the latter end of May,
me&s;&s;ages from the King to both Hou&s;es of parliament were
delivered by the Earl of Holderne&s;&s;e and Mr. Pitt, the two
&s;ecretaries of &s;tate, &s;ignifying that his Maje&s;ty had re|ceived
advices of preparations making by the French
court, with a de&s;ign to invade Great-Britain: that though
per&s;uaded, by the univer&s;al zeal and affection of his people,
any &s;uch attempt mu&s;t, under the ble&s;&s;ing of God, end in
the de&s;truction of tho&s;e who engaged in it; yet he ap|prehended
he &s;hould not act con&s;i&s;tent with that paternal
care and concern which he had always &s;hewn for the &s;afety
and pre&s;ervation of his &s;ubjects, if he omitted any means
in his power which might be nece&s;&s;ary for their defence:
he, therefore, acquainted the parliament with his having
received repeated intelligence of the enemy's preparations,
to the end that his Maje&s;ty might, if he &s;hould think pro|per,
in pur&s;uance of the late act of parliament, cau&s;e the
militia, or &s;uch part thereof as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, to be
drawn out and embodied, in order to march as occa&s;ion
&s;hould require. The&s;e me&s;&s;ages were no &s;ooner read,
than each Hou&s;e &s;eparately re&s;olved to pre&s;ent an addre&s;s,
thanking his Maje&s;ty for having communicated this in|telligence;
a&s;&s;uring him that they would, with their lives
and fortunes, &s;upport him again&s;t all attempts whatever:
that, warmed with affection and zeal for his per&s;on and
government, and animated by indignation at the daring
de&s;igns of an enemy who&s;e fleet had hitherto &s;hunned the
terrour of the Briti&s;h navy, they would chearfully exert
<PB N="459" REF="463">
their utmo&s;t efforts to repel all in&s;ults, and effectually en|able
their &s;overeign, not only to di&s;appoint the attempts of
France, but, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, turn them to their
own confu&s;ion. The Commons at the &s;ame time re&s;olved
upon another addre&s;s, de&s;iring his Maje&s;ty would give di|rections
to his lieutenants of the &s;everal counties, ridings,
and places within South-Britain, to u&s;e their utmo&s;t dili|gence
and attention in executing the &s;everal acts of par|liament
made for the better ordering the militia.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIX. The&s;e and other precautionary &s;teps were
accordingly taken; but the admini&s;tration wi&s;ely placed
their chief dependence upon the &s;trength of the navy, part
of which was &s;o divided and &s;tationed, as to block up all
the harbours of France in which the enemy were known
to make any naval armament of con&s;equence. We have
&s;een in what manner Rear-Admiral Rodney vi&s;ited the
town and harbour of Havre-de-Grace, and &s;coured that
part of the coa&s;tin &s;ucce&s;&s;ive crui&s;es: we have al&s;o recorded
the expedition and victory of Admiral Bo&s;cawen over the
&s;quadron of La Clue, which was equipped at Toulon,
with a de&s;ign to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the projected inva&s;ion. Notwith|&s;tanding
this di&s;a&s;ter, the French mini&s;try per&s;i&s;ted in their
de&s;ign; towards the execution of which they had pre|pared
another con&s;iderable fleet, in the harbours of Roche|fort,
Bre&s;t, and Port-Louis, to be commanded by M. de
Conflans, and re-enforced by a con&s;iderable body of troops,
which were actually a&s;&s;embled under the Duc d'Aiguillon,
at Vannes, in Lower Bretagne. Flat-bottomed boats and
tran&s;ports to be u&s;ed in this expedition were prepared in
different ports on the coa&s;t of France; and a &s;mall &s;qua|dron
was equipped at Dunkirk, under the command of an
enterpri&s;ing adventurer, called Thurot, who had, in the
cour&s;e of the preceding year, &s;ignali&s;ed his courage and
conduct in a large privateer called the Bellei&s;le, which had
&s;coured the North Seas, taken a number of &s;hips, and at
one time maintained an ob&s;tinate battle again&s;t two Eng|li&s;h
frigates, which were obliged to de&s;i&s;t, after having re|ceived
con&s;iderable damage. This man's name became a
<PB N="460" REF="464">
terrour to the merchants of Great-Britain; for his va|lour
was not more remarkable in battle than his conduct
in eluding the pur&s;uit of the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers, who were
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively detached in que&s;t of him, through every part
of the German Ocean and North &s;ea, as far as the i&s;land
of Orkneys. It mu&s;t be likewi&s;e owned, for the honour
of human nature, that this bold mariner, though de&s;titute
of the advantages of birth and education, was remarkably
di&s;tingui&s;hed by his genero&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e who
had the misfortune to fall into his power; and that his
deportment in every re&s;pect entitled him to a much more
honourable rank in the &s;ervice of his country. The court
of Ver&s;ailles were not in&s;en&s;ible to his merit. He obtain|ed
a commi&s;&s;ion from the French King, and was ve&s;ted
with the command of the &s;mall armament now fitting out
in the harbour of Dunkirk. The Briti&s;h government
being appri&s;ed of all the&s;e particulars, took &s;uch mea&s;ures
to defeat the purpo&s;ed inva&s;ion as mu&s;t have conveyed a
very high idea of the power of Great-Britain to tho&s;e who
con&s;idered, that, exclu&s;ive of the force oppo&s;ed to this
de&s;ign, they at the &s;ame time carried on the mo&s;t vigorous
and important operations of war in Germany, America,
the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies. Thurot's armament at Dun|kirk
was watched by an Engli&s;h &s;quadron in the Downs,
commanded by Commodore Boys; the port of Havre was
guarded by Rear-Admiral Rodney; Mr. Bo&s;cawen had
been &s;tationed off Toulon, and the coa&s;t of Vannes was
&s;coured by a &s;mall &s;quadron detached from Sir Edward
Hawke, who had during the &s;ummer blocked up the har|bour
of Bre&s;t, where Conflans lay with his fleet, in order
to be joined by the other divi&s;ions of the armament.
The&s;e different &s;quadrons of the Briti&s;h navy were con|nected
by a chain of &s;eparate crui&s;ers; &s;o that the whole
coa&s;t of France, from Dunkirk to the extremity of Bre|tagne,
was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by an actual blockade.</P>
<P>&sect; L. The French mini&s;try being thus hampered, forbore
their attempt upon Britain; and the projected inva&s;ion
&s;eemed to hang in &s;u&s;pen&s;e till the month of Augu&s;t, in
<PB N="461" REF="465">
the beginning of which their army in Germany was de|feated
at Minden. Their de&s;igns in that country being
baffled by this di&s;a&s;ter, they &s;eemed to convert their chief
attention to their &s;ea-armament; the preparations were
re&s;umed with redoubled vigour; and even after the defeat
of La Clue, they re&s;olved to try their fortune in a de&s;cent.
They now propo&s;ed to di&s;embark a body of troops in Ire|land.
Thurot received orders to &s;ail from Dunkirk with
the fir&s;t opportunity, and &s;hape his cour&s;e round the nor|thern
parts of Scotland, that he might alarm the coa&s;t of
Ireland, and make a diver&s;ion from that part where Con|flans
intended to effectuate the di&s;embarkation of his forces.
The tran&s;ports and &s;hips of war were a&s;&s;embled at Bre&s;t
and Rochefort, having on board a train of artillery, with
&s;addles, and other accoutrements for cavalry, to be mount|ed
in Ireland; and a body of French troops, including
part of the Iri&s;h brigade, was kept in readine&s;s to embark.
The execution of this &s;cheme was, however, prevented by
the vigilance of Sir Edward Hawke, who blocked up the
harbour of Bre&s;t with a fleet of twenty-three capital &s;hips;
while another &s;quadron of &s;maller &s;hips and frigates, under
the command of Captain Duff, continued to crui&s;e along
the French coa&s;t, from Port L'Orient, in Bretagne, to the
point of St. Gilles in Poitou. At length, however, in the
beginning of November, the Briti&s;h &s;quadron, command|ed
by Sir Edward Hawke, Sir Charles hardy, and Rear-Admiral
Geary, were driven from the coa&s;t of France by
&s;tre&s;s of weather, and on the ninth day of the month
anchored in Torbay. The French admiral, Conflans,
&s;natched this opportunity of failing from Bre&s;t, with one-and-twenty
&s;ail of the line and four frigates, in hopes of
being able to de&s;troy the Engli&s;h &s;quadron commanded by
Captain Duff, before the larger fleet could return from the
coa&s;t of England. Sir Edward Hawke having received in|telligence
that the French fleet had failed from Bre&s;t, im|mediately
&s;tood to &s;ea, in order to pur&s;ue them; and in
the mean time, the government i&s;&s;ued orders for guarding
all tho&s;e parts of the coa&s;t that were thought the mo&s;tex|po&s;ed
<PB N="462" REF="466">
to a de&s;cent. The land-forces were put in motion,
and quartered along the &s;hore of Kent and Suffex: all the
&s;hips of war in the different harbours, even tho&s;e that had
ju&s;t arrived from America, were ordered to put to &s;ea,
and every &s;tep was taken to di&s;concert the de&s;igns of the
enemy.</P>
<P>&sect; LI. While the&s;e mea&s;ures were taken with equal
vigour and deliberation, Sir Edward Hawke &s;teered his
cour&s;e directly for Quiberon, on the coa&s;t of Bretagne,
which he &s;uppo&s;ed would be the rendezvous of the French
&s;quadron; but, notwith&s;tanding his utmo&s;t efforts, he was
driven by a hard gale con&s;iderably to the we&s;tward, where
he was joined by two frigates, the Maid&s;tone and Coven|try.
The&s;e he directed to keep a-head of the &s;quadron.
The weather growing more moderate, the former made
the &s;ignal for &s;eeing a fleet, on the twentieth day of No|vember,
at half an hour pa&s;t eight o'clock in the morn|ing,
and in an hour afterwards di&s;covered them to be the
enemy's &s;quadron. They were at that time in cha&s;e of
Captain Duff's &s;quadron, which now joined the large
fleet, after having run &s;ome ri&s;que of being taken. Sir
Edward Hawke, who, when the Maid&s;tone gave the fir&s;t
notice, had formed the line a-brea&s;t, now perceiving that
the French admiral endeavoured to e&s;cape with all the fail
he could carry, threw out a &s;ignal for &s;even of his &s;hips
that were neare&s;t the enemy to cha&s;e, and endeavour to
detain them, until they could be re-enforced by the re&s;t
of the &s;quadron, which were ordered to form into a
line of battle a-head, as they cha&s;ed, that no time
might be lo&s;t in the pur&s;uit. Con&s;idering the roughne&s;s of
the weather, which was extremely tempe&s;tuous; the nature
of the coa&s;t, which is in this place rendered very hazard|ous
by a great number of &s;and-banks, &s;hoals, rocks, and
i&s;lands, as entirely unknown to the Briti&s;h &s;ailors, as they
were familiar to the French navigators; the dangers of a
&s;hort day, dark night, and lee-&s;hore; it required extra|ordinary
re&s;olution in the Engli&s;h admiral to attempt ho|&s;tilities
on this occa&s;ion: but Sir Edward Hawke, &s;teeled
<PB N="463" REF="467">
with the integrity and fortitude of his own heart, animated
by a warm love for his country, and well acquainted with
the importance of the &s;take on which the &s;afety of that
country in a great mea&s;ure depended, was re&s;olved to run
extraordinary ri&s;ques in his endeavours to fru&s;trate at once
a boa&s;ted &s;cheme projected for the annoyance of his fellow-&s;ubjects.
With regard to his &s;hips of the line, he had
but the advantage of one in point of number, and no &s;upe|riority
in men or metal, con&s;equently, M. de Conflans
might have hazarded a fair battle on the open &s;ea, without
any imputation of temerity: but he thought proper to play
a more artful game, though it did not &s;ucceed according
to his expectation. He kept his fleet in a body, and re|tired
clo&s;e in &s;hore, with a view to draw the Engli&s;h &s;qua|dron
among the &s;hoals and i&s;lands, on which he hoped they
would pay dear for their ra&s;hne&s;s and impetuo&s;ity, while he
and his officers, who were perfectly acquainted with the
navigation, could either &s;tay, and take advantage of the
di&s;a&s;ter, or, if hard pre&s;&s;ed, retire through channels un|known
to the Briti&s;h pilots. At half an hour after two,
the van of the Engli&s;h fleet began the engagement with
the rear of the enemy, in the neighbourhood of Bellei&s;le.
Every &s;hip as &s;he advanced poured in a broad&s;ide on the
&s;ternmo&s;t of the French, and bore down upon their van,
leaving the rear to tho&s;e that came after. Sir Edward
Hawke, in the Royal George, of one hundred and ten
guns, re&s;erved his fire in pa&s;&s;ing through the rear of the
enemy, and ordered his ma&s;ter to bring him along-&s;ide of
the French admiral, who commanded in per&s;on on board
the Soleil Royal, a &s;hip mounted with eighty cannon,
and provided with a comlement of twelve hundred men.
When the pilot remon&s;trated that he could not obey his
command, without the mo&s;t imminent risque of running
upon a &s;hoal, the brave veteran replied, &startq;You have done
your duty in &s;howing the danger; now you are to com|ply
with my order, and lay me along-&s;ide the Soleil
Royal.&endq; His wi&s;h was gratified: the Royal George
ranged up with the French admiral. The The&s;&eacute;e, an|other
<PB N="464" REF="468">
large &s;hip of the enemy, running up between the two
commanders, &s;u&s;tained the fire that was re&s;erved for the
Soleil Royal; but in returning the fir&s;t broad &s;ide foundered,
in con&s;equence of the high &s;ea that entered her lower deck|ports,
and filled her with water. Notwith&s;tanding the
boi&s;terous weather, a great number of &s;hips on both &s;ides
fought with equal fury and dubious &s;ucce&s;s, till about four
in the afternoon, when the Formidable &s;truck her colours.
The Superbe &s;hared the fate of the The&s;&eacute;e going to the
bottom. The Hero hauled down her colours in token
of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and dropped anchor; but the wind was &s;o
high, that no boat could be &s;ent to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. By
this time day-light began to fail, and the greater part of the
French fleet e&s;caped under cover of the darkne&s;s. Night
approaching, the wind blowing with augmented violence
on a lee-&s;hore, and the Briti&s;h &s;quadron being entangled
among unknown &s;hoals and i&s;lands, Sir Edward Hawke
made the &s;ignal for anchoring to the we&s;tward of the &s;mall
i&s;land Dumet; and here the fleet remained all night in a
very dangerous riding, alarmed by the fury of the &s;torm,
and the ince&s;&s;ant firing of guns of di&s;tre&s;s, without their
knowing whether it proceeded from friend or enemy.
The Soleil Royal had, under favour of the night, anchor|ed
al&s;o in the mid&s;t of the Briti&s;h &s;quadron; but at day-break
M. de Conflans ordered her cable to be cut, and &s;he
drove a-&s;hore to the we&s;tward of Crozie. The Engli&s;h
admiral immediately made &s;ignal to the E&s;&s;ex to &s;lip cable,
and pur&s;ue her; and, in obeying this order, &s;he ran un|fortunately
on a &s;and-bank called Lefour, where the Re|&s;olution,
another &s;hip of the Briti&s;h &s;quadron, was already
grounded. Here they were both irrecoverably lo&s;t, in &s;pite
of all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that could be given: but all their men,
and part of their &s;tores, were &s;aved, and the wrecks &s;et on
fire by order of the admiral. He likewi&s;e detached the
Portland, Chatham, and Vengeance to de&s;troy the Soleil
Royal, which was burned by her own people, before the
Engli&s;h &s;hips could approach; but they arrived time
enough to reduce the Hero to a&s;hes on the Lefour, where
<PB N="465" REF="469">
&s;he had been al&s;o &s;tranded; and the Ju&s;te, another of their
great &s;hips, peri&s;hed in the mouth of the Loire. The Ad|miral,
perceiving &s;even large &s;hips of the enemy riding at
anchor between Point Penvas and the mouth of the river
Vilaine, made the &s;ignal to weigh, in order to attack them,
but the fury of the &s;torm increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that
he was obliged to remain at anchor, and even order the
top-gallant-ma&s;ts to be &s;truck. In the mean time, the
French &s;hips being lightened of their cannon, their officers
took advantage of the flood, and a more moderate gale
under the land, to enter the Vilaine, where they lay within
half a mile of the entrance, protected by &s;ome occa&s;ional
batteries erected on the &s;hore, and by two large frigates
moored acro&s;s the mouth of the harbour. Thus they
were effectually &s;ecured from any attempts of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els;
and as for large &s;hips, there was not water &s;ufficient to
float them within fighting di&s;tance of the enemy. On
the whole, this battle, in which a very incon&s;iderable num|ber
of lives was lo&s;t, may be con&s;dered as one of the mo&s;t
perilous and important actions that ever happened in any
war between the two nations; for it not only defeated the
projected inva&s;ion, which had hung menacing &s;o long
over the apprehen&s;ions of Great-Britain; but it gave the
fini&s;hing blow to the naval power of France, which was
totally di&s;abled from undertaking any thing of con&s;e|quence
in the &s;equel<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">During this war, the Engli&s;h had already taken and de&s;troyed twenty-&s;even French &s;hips of the line, and thirty-one frigates: two of their great &s;hips and four frigates peri&s;hed; &s;o that their whole lo&s;s, in this particular, amount|ed to &s;ixty-four; whereas, the lo&s;s of Great-Britain did not exceed &s;even &s;aid of the line, and five frigates. It may be ea&s;ily conceived how the French marine, at fir&s;t greatly inferior to the naval power of Britain, rou&s;t have been affected by this dreadful balance to its prejudice.</NOTE>. By this time, indeed, Thurot had
e&s;caped from Dunkirk, and directed his cour&s;e to the
North-Sea, whither he was followed by Commodore Boys,
who neverthele&s;s was di&s;appointed in his pur&s;uit; but the
fate of that enterpri&s;ing adventurer falls under the annals
of the en&s;uing year, among the tran&s;actions of which it
&s;hall be recorded. As for Sir Edward Hawke, he conti|nued
crui&s;ing off the coa&s;t of Bretagne for a con&s;iderable
<PB N="466" REF="470">
time after the victory he had obtained, taking particular
care to block up the mouth of the river Vilaine, that the
&s;even French &s;hips might not e&s;cape and join M. Conflans,
who made &s;hift to reach Rochefort with the &s;hattered re|mains
of his &s;quadron. Indeed, this &s;ervice became &s;uch
a con&s;iderable object in the eyes of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, that
a large fleet was maintained upon this coa&s;t, apparently for
no other purpo&s;e, during a whole year, and, after all, the
enemy eluded their vigilance. Sir Edward Hawke, hav|ing
undergone a long and dangerous conflict with tem|pe&s;tuous
weather, was at length recalled, and pre&s;ented to
his &s;overeign, who gratified him with a con&s;iderable pen|&s;ion,
for the courage and conduct he had &s;o often and &s;o
long di&s;played in the &s;ervice of his country; and his ex|traordinary
merit was afterwards honoured with the appro|bation
of the parliament. The people of France were &s;o
di&s;pirited by the defeat of their army at Minden, and the
di&s;a&s;ter of their &s;quadron at Lagos, that the mini&s;try of
Ver&s;ailles thought proper to conceal the extent of their la&s;t
misfortune under a palliating detail publi&s;hed in the Ga|zette
of Paris, as a letter from M. Conflans to the Count
de St. Florentin, &s;ecretary of the marine. In this partial
mi&s;repre&s;entation their admiral was made to affirm, that
the Briti&s;h fleet con&s;i&s;ted of forty &s;hips of the line of battle,
be&s;ides frigates; that the Soleil Royal had obliged the
Royal George to &s;heer off; that the &s;even &s;hips which
retreated into the river Vilaine had received very little
damage, and would be &s;oon repaired; and that, by the
junction of Bompart's &s;quadron, he &s;hould be &s;oon able to
give a good account of the Engli&s;h admiral. The&s;e tu|mid
a&s;&s;ertions, &s;o void of truth, are not to be imputed to an
illiberal &s;pirit of vain glory, &s;o much as to a political de|&s;ign
of extenuating the national calamity, and &s;upporting
the &s;pirit of the people.</P>
<P>&sect; LII. The alarm of the French inva&s;ion, which was
thus &s;o happily fru&s;trated, not only di&s;turbed the quiet of
Great-Britain, but al&s;o diffu&s;ed it&s;elf to the kingdom of
Ireland, where it was productive of &s;ome publick di&s;|order.
<PB N="467" REF="471">
In the latter end of October the two Hou&s;es of
parliament, a&s;&s;embled at Dublin, received a formal me&s;|&s;age
from the Duke of Bedford, lord-lieutenant of that
kingdom, to the following effect: That, by a letter from
the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, written by his Maje&s;ty's expre&s;s
command, it appeared that France, far from re&s;igning
her plan of inva&s;ion, on account of the di&s;a&s;ter that befel
her Toulon &s;quadron, was more and more confirmed in
her purpo&s;e, and even in&s;tigated by de&s;pair it&s;elf, to at|tempt
at all hazards the only re&s;ource &s;he &s;eemed to have
left for thwarting, by a diver&s;ion at home, the mea&s;ures
of England abroad in pro&s;ecuting a war which hitherto
opened, in all parts of the world, &s;o unfavourable a pro|&s;pect
to the view of French ambition: that in ca&s;e the
body of French troops, amounting to eighteen thou&s;and
men, under the command of the Duc d'Aiguillon,
a&s;&s;embled at Vannes, where al&s;o a &s;ufficient number of
tran&s;ports was prepared, &s;hould be able to clude the Bri|ti&s;h
&s;quadron, Ireland would, in all probability, be one
of their chief objects; his grace thought it, therefore, in|cumbent
upon him, in a matter of &s;uch high importance
to the welfare of that kingdom, to communicate this in|telligence
to the Iri&s;h parliament. He told them, his
Maje&s;ty would make no doubt but that the zeal of his
faithful prote&s;tant &s;ubjects in that kingdom had been
already &s;ufficeintly quickened by the repeated accounts
received of the enemy's dangerous de&s;igns, and actual pre|parations
made, at a va&s;t expen&s;e, in order to inv$de the
&s;everal parts of the Briti&s;h dominions. He gave them to
under&s;tand he had received his &s;overeign's commands to
u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to animate and excite his loyal
people of Ireland to exert their well-known zeal and &s;pirit
in &s;upport of his Maje&s;ty's government, and in defence of
all that was dear to them, by timely preparation to re&s;i&s;t
and fru&s;trate any attempts of the enemy to di&s;turb the quiet
and &s;hake the &s;ecurity of this kngdom: he, therefore,
in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, recommended it to them to mani|fe&s;t,
upon this occa&s;ion, that zeal for the pre&s;ent happy
<PB N="468" REF="472">
e&s;tabli&s;hment, and that affection for his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on
and government, by which the parliament of that nation
had been &s;o often di&s;tingui&s;hed. Immediately after this
me&s;&s;age was communicated, the Hou&s;e of Commons una|nimou&s;ly
re&s;olved to pre&s;ent an addre&s;s to the Lord-Lieu|tenant,
thanking his grace for the care and concern he
had &s;hown for the &s;afety of Ireland in having imparted
intelligence of &s;o great importance; de&s;iring him to make
u&s;e of &s;uch means as &s;hould appear to him the mo&s;t effectual
for the &s;ecurity and defence of the kingdom; and a&s;&s;uring
him, that the Hou&s;e would make good whatever expen&s;e
&s;hould be nece&s;&s;arily incurred for that purpo&s;e. This in|timation,
and the &s;teps that were taken in con&s;equence
of it for the defence of Ireland, produced &s;uch appre|hen&s;ions
and di&s;traction among the people of that king|dom,
as had well nigh proved fatal to the publick cre|dit.
In the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of popular fear, there was
&s;uch an extraordinary run upon the banks of Dublin,
that &s;everal con&s;iderable bankers were obliged to &s;top pay|ment;
and the circulation was in danger of being &s;uden|ly
&s;tagnated, when the Lord-Lieutenant, the members of
both Hou&s;es of parliament, the lord-mayor, aldermen,
merchants, and principal traders of Dublin, engaged in
an a&s;&s;ociation to &s;upport publick credit, by taking the
notes of bankers in payment: a re&s;olution which effectu|ally
an&s;wered the purpo&s;e intended.</P>
<P>&sect; LIII. How&s;oever the court of Ver&s;ailles might have
flattered it&s;elf that their invading army would in Ireland
be joined by a great number of the natives, in all proba|bility
it would have been di&s;appointed in this hope, had
their purpo&s;ed de&s;cent even been carried into execution,
for no &s;igns of di&s;affection to the reigning family appeared
at this juncture. On the contrary, the wealthy indivi|duals
of the Romi&s;h per &s;ua&s;ion offered to accommodate the
government with large &s;ums of money, in ca&s;e of ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
to &s;upport the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment again&s;t all its
enemies; and the Roman catholicks of the city of Cork,
in a body, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the Lord-Lieutenant,
<PB N="469" REF="473">
expre&s;&s;ing their loyalty in the warme&s;t terms of a&s;&s;urance.
After Having congratulated his grace on the unparalleled
&s;ucce&s;&s;es which had attended his Maje&s;ty's arms, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed
their &s;en&s;e of the King's paternal tenderne&s;s for his
kingdom of Ireland, they acknowledged, with the deepe&s;t
&s;en&s;e of gratitude, that protection and indulgence they
had enjoyed under his Maje&s;ty's mild and au&s;picious reign.
They profe&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t indignation at the threatened
inva&s;ion of the kingdom, by an enemy, who, grown de&s;|perate
from repeated defeats, might po&s;&s;ibly make that
attempt as a la&s;t effort, vainly flattered with the imaginary
hope of a&s;&s;i&s;tance in Ireland, from the former attachments
of their deluded predece&s;&s;ors. They a&s;&s;ured his grace, in
the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that &s;uch &s;chemes were alto|gether
incon&s;i&s;tent with their principles and intentions:
that they would, to the utmo&s;t exertion of their abilities,
with their lives and fortunes, join in the defence and &s;upport
of his Maje&s;ty's royal per&s;on and government again&s;t all
invaders what&s;oever: that they &s;hould be always ready to
concur in &s;uch mea&s;ures, and to act &s;uch parts in defence
of the kingdom, in common with the re&s;t of his Maje&s;ty's
&s;ubjects, as his grace in his great wi&s;dom &s;hould be plea&s;ed
to appoint; and think them&s;elves particularly happy to be
under the direction and command of &s;o known an a&s;&s;ertor
of liberty, &s;uch an important and di&s;tingui&s;hed governor.
Finally, they expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h, that his
Maje&s;ty's arms might be crowned with &s;uch a continuance
of &s;ucce&s;s, as &s;hould enable him to defeat the devices of
all his enemies, and obtain a &s;peedy and honourable peace.
This cordial addre&s;s, which was tran&s;mitted to the Earl of
Shannon, and by him pre&s;ented to the Duke of Bed|ford,
mu&s;t have been very agreeable to the government
at &s;uch a critical conjuncture.</P>
<P>&sect; LIV. Although no traces of di&s;affection to his Maje|&s;ty's
family appeared on this trying occa&s;ion, it mu&s;t ne|verthele&s;s
be acknowledged that a &s;pirit of di&s;&s;atisfaction
broke out with extraordinary violence among the populace
of Dublin. The pre&s;ent Lord-Lieutenant was not remark|ably
<PB N="470" REF="474">
popular in his admini&s;tration. He had be&s;towed one
place of con&s;iderable importance upon a gentleman who&s;e
per&s;on was obnoxious to many people in that kingdom,
and perhaps failed in that affability and conde&s;cen&s;ion
which a free and ferocious nation expects to find in the
character of him to who&s;e rule they are &s;ubjected. Whe|ther
the offence taken at his deportment had created ene|mies
to his per&s;on, or the nation in general began to en|tertain
doubts and jealou&s;ies of the government's de&s;igns;
certain it is, great pains were taken to propagate a belief
among the lower &s;ort of people, that an union would &s;oon
be effected between Great-Britain and Ireland; in which
ca&s;e this la&s;t kingdom would be deprived of its parliament
and independency, and be &s;ubjected to the &s;ame taxes
that are levied upon the people of England. This notion
inflamed the poulace to &s;uch a degree, that they a&s;&s;embled
in a prodigious multitude, broke into the Hou&s;e of Lords,
in&s;ulted the peers, &s;eated an old woman on the throne,
and &s;earched for the journals, which, had they been
found, they would have committed to the flames. Not
content with this outrage, they compelled the members
of both Hou&s;es whom they met in the &s;treets to take an
oath that they would never con&s;ent to &s;uch an union, or
give any vote contrary to the true intere&s;t of Ireland.
Divers coaches belonging to obnoxious per&s;ons were de|&s;troyed,
and their hor&s;es killed; and a gibbet was erected
for one gentleman in particular, who narrowly e&s;caped
the ungovernable rage of tho&s;e riotous in&s;urgents. A body
of hor&s;e and infantry were drawn out on this occa&s;ion, in
order to over-awe the multitude, which at night di&s;per&s;ed
of it&s;elf. Next day addre&s;&s;es to the Lord-Lieutenant were
agreed to by both Hou&s;es of parliament, and a commit|tee
of enquiry appointed, that the ringleaders of the tu|mult
might be di&s;covered, and brought to condign pu|ni&s;hment.</P>
<P>&sect; LV. When the mini&s;try of England received the fir&s;t
advice that M. Thurot had e&s;caped from Dunkirk with
a &s;mall &s;quadron of armed &s;hips, having on board a body
<PB N="471" REF="475">
of land-troops, de&s;igned for a private expedition on the
coa&s;t of Scotland or Ireland, expre&s;&s;es were immediately
di&s;patched to the commanding officers of the forces in
North-Britain, with orders to put the forts along the
coa&s;t of that kingdom in the be&s;t po&s;ture of defence;
and to hold every thing in readine&s;s to repel the enemy,
in ca&s;e they &s;hould attempt a de&s;cent. In con&s;equence
of the&s;e in&s;truction, beacons were erected for the imme|diate
communication of intelligence; place of rendez|vous
appointed for the regular troops and militia; and
&s;trict orders i&s;&s;ued that no officer &s;hould ab&s;ent him&s;elf
from his duty, on any preten&s;e whatever. The greate&s;t
encomium that can be given to the character of this par|tizan,
is an account of the alarm which the &s;ailing of
his puny armament &s;pread through the whole extent of
&s;uch a powerful kingdom, who&s;e fleets covered the ocean.
Perhaps Thurot's career would have been &s;ooner &s;top|ped,
had Commodore Boys been victualled for a longer
crui&s;e; but this commander was obliged to put into
Leith for a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, at the very time when
Thurot was &s;een hovering on the coa&s;t near Aberdeen;
and before the Engli&s;h &s;quadron was provided for a pro|&s;ecution
of the crui&s;e, the other had taken &s;helter at
Gottenburg, in Sweden.</P>
