<P>FInding Encouragement for a Sixth
Edition of the <HI>Ladies Travels,</HI>
as I had ju&s;t Rea&s;on from your
Merits before, todedicate a part of them
to you, &s;o the Continuation of your
particular Favours makes me take this
Opportunity to acknowledge them, and
now to Addre&s;s the Whole. I found
the former Editions to have good Suc|ce&s;s
under your Name; &s;o that both
Profit and Gratitude oblige me again
to beg you to take this Work of the
Fair Sex into your further Protection
and Patronage. Your Great Skill in
that Excellent Art, which with &s;o much
Life and Plea&s;ure repre&s;ents the La|dies,
be&s;ides your other extraordinary
<PB REF="3">
Qualifications, endears you to them,
and I hope will influence them to help
me off with this Impre&s;&s;ion. They
will certainly for the Honour of their
Sex, contribute to let this Incompara|ble
Lady's Productions have a more
exten&s;ive Spread and Acquaintance.</P>
<P>Pardon me, Sir, and give me leave
to conclude with my humble Thanks
for all your Civilities and Kindne&s;&s;es,

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>SEEING you are &s;o earne&s;t with me to let you know
all my Adventures, and what&s;oever I have ob&s;erved du|ring
my Travels, you mu&s;t therefore be contented (my
dear Cou&s;en) to bear with a great many trifling Occur|rences,
before you can meet with what will plea&s;e you: I
know your fancy is &s;o nice and delicate, that none but ex|traordinary
Accidents can entertain you; and I wi&s;h I had no
others to relate: but recounting things faithfully, as they have
happened, you mu&s;t be contented therewith.</P>
<P>I gave you an Account in my la&s;t, of what I met with
as far as <HI>Bayonne;</HI> you know this is a Town in <HI>France,</HI> Fron|tier
to <HI>Spain,</HI> wa&s;hed by the Rivers <HI>Dadour</HI> and <HI>Nivelle,</HI>
which joyn together, and the Sea comes up to them. The
Port and Trade are con&s;iderable: I came from <HI>Axe</HI> by Water,
and ob&s;erved that the Boat-men of <HI>Adour</HI> have the &s;ame Cu&s;tom
as tho&s;e of <HI>Carrone;</HI> which is to &s;ay, That in pa&s;&s;ing by one
another, they &s;et up a Hollowing; and they had rather lo&s;e
their Wages than to forbear the&s;e &s;ort of &s;houtings, although
exceeding vexatious to tho&s;e who are not u&s;ed to them. There
are two Ca&s;tles &s;trong enough to defend the Town, and there
are about it &s;everal plea&s;ant Walks.</P>
<P>At my Arrival there, I intreated the Baron <HI>de Ca&s;tlenau,</HI> who
had accompanyed me from <HI>Axe,</HI> to bring me acquainted with
<PB N="2" REF="5">
&s;ome Women, with whom I might &s;pend my time with le&s;s
impatience till the Litters came, which were to be &s;ent to me
from St. <HI>Seba&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>He readily complied with my Reque&s;t: for being a Per&s;on of
Quality and Worth, he is much e&s;teemed at <HI>Bayonne.</HI> He fail'd
not the next Morning to bring &s;everal Ladies to vi&s;it me.</P>
<P>The&s;e Women begin here to feel the Scorching Heats of the
Sun; their Complexion is dark, their Eye &s;parkling; they
are charming enough, their Wits are &s;harp: And I could give
you a farther Account of their Capacities, could I have better
under&s;tood what they &s;aid: not but that they could all &s;peak
<HI>French,</HI> yet with &s;uch a different Dialect, as &s;urpa&s;t my Under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Some who came to &s;ee me, brought little &s;ucking Pigs under
their Arms, as we do little Dogs: its true they were very
&s;pruce, and &s;everal of them had Collars of Ribbons, of various
Colours: However, this Cu&s;tom looks very odd, and I cannot
but think that &s;everal among&s;t them&s;elves are di&s;gu&s;ted at it&punc;
When they danced, they mu&s;t &s;et them down, and let the&s;e
grunting Animals run about the Chamber, where they made a
very plea&s;ant Harmony. The&s;e Ladies danced at my Intreaty,
the Baron of <HI>Ca&s;tleneau</HI> having &s;ent for Pipes and Tabors.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen who attended the Ladies, took each of 'em
her whom he had brought with him, and the Dance began in a
Round, all holding Hands: they had afterwards long Canes
brought them, and then each Spark taking hold of the Ladies
Handkerchief, which &s;eparated them from one another, moved
very gracefully at the Sound of this Martial &s;ort of Mu&s;ick, which
in&s;pired them with &s;uch Heat that they &s;eem'd not to be able
to moderate it. This &s;eemed to me to re&s;emble the <HI>Pyrric</HI>
Dance &s;o much celebrated by the Ancients; for the&s;e Gentle|men
and Ladies made &s;o many Turns, Frisks and Capers, their
Canes being thrown up into the Air, and dextrou&s;ly caught
again, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe their Art and Agility:
And I had a great deal of Plea&s;ure in &s;eeing 'em, but methoughts
it la&s;ted too long, and I began to grow weary of this ill ordered
Ball: When the Baron <HI>de Ca&s;tleneau,</HI> who perceived it, cau&s;ed &s;e|veral
Baskets of dried Fruit to be brought in. They are the <HI>Jews</HI>
who pa&s;t for <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> and dwell at <HI>Bayonne,</HI> who tran&s;port
them from <HI>Genoa,</HI> and furni&s;h all the Country with them. We
wanted not for <HI>Limonade,</HI> and other refre&s;hing Waters, of which
the&s;e Ladies drank heartily; and &s;o the Entertainment ended.</P>
<P>I was carry'd the next Morning to &s;ee the Synagogue of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> in the Suburb of the Holy Spirit, but met with nothing
<PB N="3" REF="6">
remarkable there. Mon&s;ieur <HI>de St. Pe,</HI> the Kings Lieutenant,
who came to &s;ee me, though much troubled with the Gout,
invited me to Dine at his Hou&s;e, where I was mo&s;t deliciou&s;ly
entertained; for this is a Country abounding with good Cheer,
and at cheap Rates. I found here Women of Quality, that
were very hand&s;ome, whom he had invited to bear me Compa|ny.
The &s;ight of the Ca&s;tle, which faces the River, is very
plea&s;ant, and has always a good Garri&s;on in it.</P>
<P>At my return to my Lodging, I was &s;urpriz'd to find &s;everal
Pieces of Linnen, which were brought to me from the Ladies
who came to &s;ee me, with Baskets full of dried Sweet-meats.
This Treatment &s;eem'd to me very obliging, to a Lady whom
they had not known above four or five Days. But I mu&s;t not
forget to tell you, there is not any finer Linnen in the World
than that which is made in this Country, &s;ome of which is
open like Net-work, and the Threads of it finer than Hair:
And I remember, that travelling thro' the Villages of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI>
which may be rather call'd De&s;arts, the poor Pea&s;ants living &s;o
wretchedly; yet I found among them as neat Napkins as tho&s;e
u&s;ed among&s;t People of Quality at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ailed not to &s;end the&s;e Ladies &s;uch little Pre&s;ents which I
thought might plea&s;e them: I perceiv'd they were great Ad|mirers
of Ribbons, and wear a great many on their Heads and
Ears, which made me &s;end them a great many; to which I ad|ded
&s;everal Fans: and they, by way of Return, pre&s;ented me
with Gloves, and Thread-Stockings, mo&s;t delicately knit.</P>
<P>In &s;ending them to me, they de&s;ired me to go to the next
Chappel, which was not far from my Quarters, where they in|tended
to Regale me with the be&s;t Mu&s;ick the Town would af|ford:
but though they were very good Voices, yet there is no
great plea&s;ure in hearing them, becau&s;e they want both Air
and Skill.</P>
<P>The Litters which I expected from <HI>Spain</HI> being come, I
prepared for my Departure; but I never met any thing dearer
than the&s;e &s;ort of Equipages; for each Litter has a Ma&s;ter that
accompanies it, who keeps the Gravity of a <HI>Roman</HI> Senator,
being mounted on a Mule, and his man on another, with
which they relea&s;e ever and anon tho&s;e that carry the Litter.
I had two, I took the greate&s;t for my &s;elf and my Child, and
had be&s;ides four Mules for my Servants, and two others for my
Biggage; to conduct them, there were other two Ma&s;ters and
two Men. You &s;ee what Charge one is at, to go to <HI>Madrid,</HI>
&s;eeing you mu&s;t pay not only for their Attendance on you for|wards,
but the &s;ame Price for their return back: However,
<PB N="4" REF="7">
we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to their Cu&s;toms, and &s;uffer our &s;elves to be
peeled by them.</P>
<P>I found at <HI>Bayonne</HI> &s;everal <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> and I think a
wor&s;e &s;ort of People, and the&s;e are Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e-Men: I had
cau&s;ed my Trunks to be weighed at <HI>Paris,</HI> that I might have
the le&s;s to do with the&s;e &s;ort of People, but they were more
&s;ubtle, or to &s;peak better, more ob&s;inate than I, &s;o that I was
f$rced to give them what&s;oever they demanded. Scarcely
was I got clear from a them, when the Drums, Trumpets, Pipes,
and Violins of the Town, came thundring upon me, they fol|lowed
me farther than St. <HI>Anthony's</HI> Gate, through which you pa&s;s
for <HI>Spain</HI> through <HI>Bi&s;cay:</HI> they p$ayed each of them in their
way, and all together without any Harmony, which was e|nough
to drive any one out of their Sen&s;es: I ordered &s;ome
M$ney to be given them, upon which they lef$ per&s;ecuting me.
As &s;oon as we had left <HI>Bayonne,</HI> we entered into a large bar|ren
Heath, where we &s;aw nothing but Che&s;nut-Trees; but we
afterwards pa&s;t along by the Sea, who&s;e Sand makes a delight|ful
way, and a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>We arrived in good time at St. <HI>John de Lut:</HI> nothing can be
plea&s;anter than this Borough, which is the greate&s;t in <HI>France,</HI>
and the be&s;t builts there are &s;everal &s;maller Cities: its Port
lies between two Mountains, which Nature &s;eems to have ex|pre&s;ly
placed to defend it from Storm$: the River <HI>Nivelle</HI> di&s;|gorges
it &s;elf therein; the Sea comes up very high in it, and
the greate&s;t Barks come up commodiou&s;ly to the Key. The
Seamen here are very skilful at catching Whales, and other
large Fi&s;h. We were here very well entertained, &s;o that our
Tables were covered with all &s;orts of Wild Fowl, but our
Beds were not an&s;werable, being &s;tuck with Feathers who&s;e
Piniou$ran into our &s;ides, and we wanted Qui$ts to lay on the
top of them: I thought when we were to pay, that I &s;hould
have had a large Reckoning, but they only demanded of me
half a <HI>Lewis Dor,</HI> when they would have co&s;t more than five
Pi&s;toles at <HI>Paris.</HI> The Situation of St. <HI>John de Luz</HI> is extream|ly
agreeable.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t &s;pacious part of the Town you &s;ee here a very
fine Church, built after the Modern Fa&s;hion, and here is a
Pa&s;&s;age over the River <HI>Nivelle,</HI> on a Wooden Bridge of great
length. Here are Toll-Gatherers, who make you pay for eve|ry
thing you carry with you, not excepting your Cloaths:
This Tax is demanded at their Plea&s;ure, and it is exce&s;&s;ive on
Strangers. I was weary with &s;peaking <HI>French</HI> to them, and pro|te&s;ting
I was no <HI>Spaniard;</HI> they feigning not to under&s;tand
<PB N="5" REF="8">
me, &s;neering in my Face, and wrapping up their Heads in
their Hooded-Gowns, they &s;eemed to me to be Thieves, di&s;|gui&s;ed
in <HI>Capuchins.</HI> In &s;hort, they taxed me eighteen Crowns,
and would per&s;wade me they u&s;ed me well, tho' I found the
contrary. But I have already told you (dear Cou&s;en,) that
when you travel this Country you mu&s;t &s;tock your &s;elf with
Patience, and good &s;tore of Money.</P>
<P>I &s;aw the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Artois,</HI> which &s;eems a &s;trong place, and
a little farther <HI>Orognes,</HI> where the <HI>Bi&s;cay</HI> is &s;poken, without
either <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI> I de&s;igned to lye at <HI>Iron,</HI> which is
but three Leagues di&s;tant from St. <HI>John de Lut,</HI> and I had &s;et out
that after Noon, but the Di&s;pute which we had with the Watch
on the Bridge, the Difficulty we had in pa&s;&s;ing the Mountains
of <HI>Beotia,</HI> and the ill Weather, joyned to other little Difficul|ties
which hapned, were the Cau&s;e that it was Night before we
arrived on the Borders of the River <HI>Bida&s;&s;oa,</HI> which &s;eparates
<HI>France</HI> from <HI>Spain.</HI> I ob&s;erved along the way from <HI>Bayonne</HI> thi|ther,
little Carriages, on which they tran&s;port every thing,
which having only two Iron Wheels, and the Noi&s;e they make
is &s;o great, that they are heard a Mile off, when they are ma|ny
of them together, which often happen, for you often meet
with Sixty or Seventy at a time, they are drawn by Oxen.
I have &s;een the &s;ame in the Villages of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> and e&s;peci|ally
on the &s;ide of <HI>Axe.</HI></P>
<P>The River of <HI>Bida&s;&s;oa</HI> is u&s;ually very &s;mall, but the Snows
melting, had increa&s;ed it to &s;uch a degree, that we had no
&s;mall trouble to pa&s;s it, &s;ome in a Boat, and others &s;wimming
on their Mules: The Moon &s;hined very bright, by means of
which I was &s;hewed on the right Hand <HI>the I&s;le of Conference,</HI>
where the Marriage of our King was made with <HI>Maria There&s;e,
Infanta of Spain.</HI> I &s;aw a while after the Fort of <HI>Fontarabia,</HI>
which belongs to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;tanding on the Mouth of
this &s;mall River, the Flux and Reflux of the Sea arrives here.
Our Kings heretofore pretended it belonged to them, there
have been &s;uch great Conte&s;ts hereupon, e&s;pecially by the
Inhabitants of <HI>Fontarabia,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Andaye,</HI> that they have
&s;everal times come to Blows. This obliged <HI>Lewis</HI> the Twelfth,
and <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> to agree, That it &s;hould be common to both Na|tions,
the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> take Toll equally, the&s;e la&s;t
making tho&s;e pay who pa&s;s into <HI>Spain,</HI> and the former doing
the like in relation to tho&s;e who pa&s;s over to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>War does not hinder Commerce on this Frontier: it's true
they cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it, &s;eeing they mu&s;t peri&s;h through
Want, did they not a&s;&s;i&s;t one another.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">
This Country called <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> is full of high Mountains, where
are &s;everal Iron Mines: The <HI>Bi&s;cays</HI> climb up the Rocks as
ea&s;ily, and with as great &s;wiftne&s;s as Stags: Their Language
(if one may call &s;uch <HI>Jargon</HI> Language) is very poor, &s;eeing one
Word &s;ignifies abundance of Things: there are none but tho&s;e
born in the Country that can under&s;tand it, and I am told,
that to the end it may be more particularly theirs, they make
no u&s;e of it in Writing; they make their Children to read
and write <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> according to which Kings Sub|jects
they are. Its certain, as &s;oon as I pa&s;t the little River of
<HI>Byda&s;&s;oa,</HI> I was not under&s;tood, unle&s;s I &s;pake <HI>Ca&s;tilian:</HI> and not
above a quarter of an Hour before, I &s;hould not have been un|der&s;tood
had <HI>I</HI> not &s;poke <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>I found on the other &s;ide of this River a Banker of St. <HI>Se|ba&s;tian,</HI>
to whom I was recommended, he carried for me with
two of his Relations, they were cloathed after the <HI>French</HI> man|ner,
but ridiculou&s;ly, their <HI>Ju&s;tau Corps</HI> being &s;hort and large,
and their Sleeves hanging down very &s;hort, tho&s;e of their Shirts
were &s;o large, that they hung down below their <HI>Ju&s;tau Corps:</HI>
they had Bands without Collars, and Periwigs, one of which had
enough Hair for four, and &s;o frizled as made them look as if
they were frighted, i&s;ler dre&s;t People you cannot meet with.
Tho&s;e who wear their own Hair, wear it very long and clo&s;e,
parting it on the Crown, and pa&s;s part of it behind their Ears,
but what kind of Ears think you? tho&s;e of <HI>Midas</HI> were not
larger, and I believe that to lengthen them, they are &s;tretched
when they be young, without que&s;tion they find &s;ome kind of
Beauty herein.</P>
<P>My three <HI>Spaniards</HI> made me in bad <HI>French</HI> mo&s;t tedious and
dull Complements. We pa&s;t through the Borough of <HI>Tran,</HI> which
is about a quarter of a League from the River, and came after|wards
to <HI>Irun,</HI> which is di&s;tant about another quarter of a
League, this little Town is the fir&s;t of <HI>Spain</HI> which you meet
with, leaving <HI>France:</HI> it's ill buil$, the Streets are unequal,
and there's nothing one can &s;peak of: We entered into the Inn
through the Stable, where are the Stairs on which you meet
a&s;cend to your Chamber; this is the Countries Fa&s;hion. I
found this Hou&s;e very light, by a great many Candles, which
were as &s;mall as Pack thread; there were at lea&s;t forty in my
Chamber, fixt on little bits of Wood; in the mid&s;t of them
&s;tood a Pan of Coals burning, made of Olive Rhine, to take
away the &s;cent of the Candles.</P>
<P>I had a great Supper, which my Gallants, the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
had cau&s;ed to be made ready for me, but all was &s;o full of Gar|lick,
<PB N="7" REF="10">
Saffron and Spice, that I could eat nothing: and I had
made very bad Cheer, had not my Cook made me a little Ragou
of what he could find.</P>
<P>Determining to go but to St. <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> the next Morning,
which is but &s;even or eight Leagues, I thought to Dine before
I &s;et out: I was &s;itting at Table, when one of my Women
brought me my Watch to wind it up, as it was my Cu&s;tom at
Noon, it was a &s;triking Watch of <HI>Tompion</HI>'s make, and co&s;t
me fifty <HI>Lewi&s;es:</HI> My Banker, who was by me, &s;hew'd &s;ome
de&s;ire to &s;ee it, I gave it him with a cu&s;tomary Civility.
This was enough, my Blade ri&s;es, makes me a profound Reve|rence,
telling me, &startq;He did not de&s;erve &s;o con&s;iderable a Pre|&s;ent,
but &s;uch a Lady as I could make no other: That he
would engage his Faith and Reputation, that he would never
part with my Watch as long as he lived, and that he found him|&s;elf
extreamly obliged to me. He ki&s;t it at the end of this
plea&s;ant Complement, and thru&s;t it into his Pocket, which
was deeper than a Sack.&endq; You'll take me to be a very great Sot
in &s;aying nothing to all this, and I do not wonder at it, but I
confe&s;s ingeniou&s;ly, I was &s;o &s;urpriz'd at his Proceeding,
that the Watch was out of &s;ight before I could re&s;olve
on what I was to do. My Women and the re&s;t of my
Servants which were about me, &s;tared on me, and I on
them blu&s;hing with Shame and Vexation to be thus caught:
However I recollected my &s;elf, and con&s;idered, that this Man
was to pay me a good round Sum of Money for the Charge of
my Journey, and to return Money to <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> where I had
taken it up; that having Bills of Credit on him, he might u&s;e
&s;everal Tricks to me, and puts-off, which might make me &s;pend
twice the Value of the Watch: In fine, I let him part with it,
and endeavoured to do my &s;elf Honour from a thing which gave
me great Mortification.</P>
<P>I have learnt, &s;ince this little Adventure, that 'tis the Cu&s;tom
in <HI>Spain,</HI> when any thing is pre&s;ented to one, if he likes it,
and ki&s;&s;es your Hand, he may take it with him. This is a ve|ry
plea&s;ant Fa&s;hion, and being &s;ufficiently acquainted with it,
'twill be my Fault if I am Trapt again.</P>
<P>I left this Inn, where they peeled me &s;ufficiently; for this
is a grievous dear Country, and every one &s;trives to be Rich at
his Neighbours Co&s;t. A while after we had left the Town,
we entered on the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Mountains, which are &s;o high and
&s;teep, that looking down you &s;ee not without Horror, the
Precipices which environ them, we went thus as far as <HI>Rentery.
Don Antonio</HI> (which was my Bankers Name) went before me,
<PB N="8" REF="11">
and for my more commodious Pa&s;&s;age, he obliged me to quit
my Litter; for although we had trave&s;t &s;everal Mountains,
yet there remained more difficult to pa&s;s, he made me to enter
into a little Boat, which he had prepared to go down the Ri|ver
of <HI>Andaye,</HI> till we were near the Mouth of the Sea, where
we &s;aw the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Gallions; there were three very
fine and large ones. Our little Boats were &s;et forth with Gilt
Streamers; they were managed by Girls who were very lu&s;ty
and hand&s;ome; there are three in each, two that Row, and
one who holds the Rudder.</P>
<P>The&s;e Wenches are very well &s;haped, of Che&s;nut Complecti|on,
have very good Teeth, Hair Black, which they tie up
with Ribbons, in Knots, and &s;o let it hang behind them. They
wear a kind of Veil on their Heads, made of Mu&s;lin, em|broidered
with Flowers of Gold and Silk, which hangs loo&s;e,
and covers their Brea&s;ts; they wear Pendants in their Ears of
Gold and Pearls, and Bracelets of Coral; they have a kind of
<HI>Ju&s;tau Corps,</HI> like our <HI>Gyp&s;ies,</HI> who&s;e Sleeves are very &s;trait. I
can a&s;&s;ure you they charmed me. I was told, the&s;e Wenches
&s;wim like Fi&s;hes, and &s;uffer neither Women nor Men among
them. This is a kind of a Republick, where they repair from
all parts, and where their Parents &s;end them very young.</P>
<P>When they are willing to marry, they go to Ma&s;s at <HI>Fon|tarabia,</HI>
which is the neare&s;t Town to them; and there the
young Men come to chu&s;e them Wives to their Humour. He
that will engage him&s;elf in <HI>Hymens</HI> Bonds, goes to his Mi|&s;tre&s;s's
Parents, declares to them his Intentions, regulates eve|ry
thing with them. And this being done, notice of it is given
to the Maid, if &s;he likes the Party, &s;he retires to their Hou&s;e,
where the Nuptials are celebrated.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw a more gay Air than that on their Countenances,
they have little $abitations along the Water-&s;ide, and there
are old Maidens, to whom the younger pay re&s;pect, as to their
Mothers. They related the&s;e Particulars to us in their Lan|guage,
and we hearkened to them with great Delight, when
the Devil, who never &s;leeps, di&s;turbed us with a vexatious Ad|venture.</P>
<P>My Cook, who is a <HI>Ga&s;con,</HI> and exactly of the Humour of
tho&s;e of that Country, was in one of our Boats behind us, at
&s;ome di&s;tance, very near a young <HI>Bi&s;caneer,</HI> who appeared
to him very hand&s;ome; he contented not him&s;elf with telling
her as much, but would have rudely turned up her Veil. She
being not u&s;ed to this &s;ort of plain Dealing, without any words
broke his Head with her Oar. Having done this Exploit, Fear
<PB N="9" REF="12">
&s;eizing on her, &s;he threw her &s;elf immediately into the Wa|ter,
tho' the Sea&s;on was very cold, and &s;wam with great &s;wift|ne&s;s;
but having all her Cloaths on, and it being far to the
Shoar, her &s;trength began to &s;ail her. Several of the&s;e
Wenches who &s;aw this at Land, leapt immediately into their
Boats to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, when tho&s;e who had remained in the
Boat with the Cook, fearing the lo&s;s of their Companion, fell
on him like two Furies, re&s;olving by all means to drown him,
and had like two or three times to have overturned their little
Ve&s;&s;el, which we beholding from ours, had much a-do to part
and appea&s;e them.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ure you, the fooli&s;h <HI>Ga&s;con</HI> was &s;o cruelly handled, that
he was all over blood; and my Banker told me, that the&s;e
young <HI>Bi&s;caneers</HI> provoked, are wor&s;e than Lions. In fine,
we came to Land, but were &s;carcely on Shoar, but we &s;aw this
Wench which was &s;aved out of the Water, making up to|wards
us, with near fifty others, each with an Oar on their
Shoulder, marching in Battle-ray, with Fife and Drum; when
&s;he who was to be the Mouth of the Company, advanced, and
calling me &s;everal times <HI>Andria,</HI> which is to &s;ay, <HI>Madam,</HI>
(&s;o that's all I could retain of her Speech) gave me to under|&s;tand,
That they would have my Cooks Skin, if Satisfaction
were not made proportionably to the Damage done their Com|panions
Cloaths. At the ending of which words, the She-Drummers
fell loudly beating their Drums, and the re&s;t of their
<HI>Amazons</HI> &s;et up an Hollowing Leaping and Dancing, and Fencing
with their Oars in a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing manner.</P>
<P><HI>Don Antonio,</HI> to make me amends for the Pre&s;ent he had
wrung from me, (I cannot but often mention it, lying on my
Heart as it does) undertook to make Peace. He found that my
Cook, who thought him&s;elf &s;ufficiently beaten, had Rea&s;on to
give nothing; and therefore he di&s;tributed &s;ome Pieces of
Money among this Marine Troop: On receipt of which they &s;et
forth lowder Hollows than before, and wi&s;hed me a good
Journey, and &s;peedy Return, each of them dancing and &s;inging
at the &s;ound of their Pipes and Tabors.</P>
<P>We entred into a very rough Way, and a&s;cending a very
long narrow Path, on the &s;ide of which there are Precipices,
&s;o that I was greatly afraid le&s;t the Mules which carryed my
Litter &s;hould &s;tumble: we afterwards pa&s;t over a large Sandy
Field. I tarryed &s;ome time in the Convent of St. <HI>Francis,</HI>
which &s;tands near the River of <HI>Andaye.</HI> We pa&s;t over it on
a very long Wooden Bridge; and though we were near St.
<HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> yet we could not then perceive it, becau&s;e a Moun-tain
<PB N="10" REF="13">
of Sand hid the Town: it's &s;ituated on the Foot of a Moun|tain,
which &s;erves on one &s;ide as a Rampart again&s;t the Sea,
and the Ve&s;&s;els come to the Foot of this Mountain, to &s;helter
them from the Storms, for here ari&s;e extraordinary Tempe&s;ts,
that the Ships at Anchor peri&s;h in the Port: it's deep, and
defended by two Moles, which leave only as much room as is
requi&s;ite for one Ve&s;&s;el pa&s;&s;ing at a time. They have rai&s;ed here
a great four Square Tower, where there is ever a good Garri&s;on
to defend the place in ca&s;e of A&s;&s;ault, it was a fine Day for the
Sea&s;on. I found the Town very plea&s;ant, being &s;urrounded
with a double Wall, there are mounted &s;everal Pieces of Can|non
on that part towards the Sea, with Ba&s;tions and Half
Moons. The Town is &s;ituated in a Province of <HI>Spain,</HI> called
<HI>Guipu&s;coa,</HI> the Out-parts are exceeding plea&s;ant, by rea&s;on that
the Sea, as I now &s;aid, &s;erves for a Channel to it: the Streets
of this Town are long and large, paved with great White
Stones, which are always clean; the Hou&s;es are well enough,
and the Churches decent, in which the Altars are of Wood,
on which are hung little Pictures, from top to bottom. Mines
of Iron and Steel abound in this Country, finer and purer
perhaps than in any other Parts of <HI>Europe;</HI> and this is the
greate&s;t part of their Trade. Here the Wool which comes from
<HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> is embarked, which makes a con&s;iderable part of their
Traffick. <HI>Bilbo</HI> and St. <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> are two of the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable
Ports which the King of <HI>Spain</HI> has on the Ocean: The
Ca&s;tle &s;tands very high, and may make an indifferent Defence,
here are mounted &s;everal fine Pieces of Cannon, and there
are a great many along the Ramparts; but the Garri&s;on is &s;o
weak, that the Women might conquer them with their
Di&s;taffs.</P>
<P>Every thing is as dear in this Town as in <HI>Paris,</HI> yet they fare
well here: Fi&s;h is excellent, and I was told Fruit was the &s;ame,
I lay in the be&s;t Inn, and when I had been there &s;ome time,
<HI>Don Ferdinand de Tolledo</HI> &s;ent his Gentlemen to enquire whether
his Vi&s;it would not be trouble&s;ome to me. My Banker, who
knew him, and who was then in my Chamber, told me, he
was a <HI>Spaniard</HI> of great Quality, Nephew to the Duke <HI>de Alva,</HI>
that he came from <HI>Flanders</HI> and was going to <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>I received him with that Civility which was due to his Birth,
and &s;oon thereunto adjoyn'd particular Re&s;pects to his own Me|rit.
He is a Gentleman of good Pre&s;ence, has Wit and Po|litene&s;s,
is Complai&s;ant and agreeable; he &s;peaks as good
<HI>French</HI> as I do; but under&s;tanding <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and being de&s;irous
to &s;peak it better, we therefore di&s;cour&s;ed only in that Lan|guage.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">
I was very well &s;atisfied with his Carriage, he told me he
came Po&s;t hither from <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and if I plea&s;ed, he would
increa&s;e my Train, and be one of my Company. I thought he
je&s;ted, and an&s;wered him accordingly; but he added, the
ways were &s;o full of Snow, that indeed they could not ride
Po&s;t; that he could make more &s;peed on Hor&s;es than in Litters,
but the Honour of accompanying me, made abundance Recom|pence
for that. In a word, I &s;ay he was a civil Per&s;on, and
came no way &s;hort of the Gallantry natural to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cava|liers:
I therefore con&s;idered how advantageous it might prove
to have a Man of this Quality, and Country, who could make
him&s;elf be heard and obeyed by the Muletteers, who have Iron
Souls and no Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>I told him, I was very glad I met with him, and the Fa|tigue
of the Road would be le&s;&s;ened by his Company. He im|mediately
thereupon ordered his Gentleman to find a Litter for
him. It being late, he took his leave of me, and I betook my
&s;elf to eat a good Supper; for my dear Cou&s;en, I am none of
tho&s;e Romantick Ladies that never eat.</P>
<P>Scarcely did I begin to &s;leep, when I heard &s;ome body
&s;peak <HI>French</HI> &s;o near me, that I thought at fir&s;t 'twas in my
Chamber, but having hearkened with more attention, I found
'twas a Chamber &s;eparated from mine by only &s;ome thin
Boards, and tho&s;e ill joynted. I drew my Curtain, and &s;aw
Light through the Crevices, and at the &s;ame time two young
Women, the elde&s;t of which appeared not to be above Seven|teen
or Eighteen, neither of them were of tho&s;e Beauties with|out
Defect, yet were they &s;o pretty, &s;pake &s;o &s;weetly, and had
&s;uch great &s;weetne&s;s on their Countenances, that I was much ta|ken
with them.</P>
<P>The younge&s;t, who &s;eemed to continue the Conver&s;ation,
&s;aid to the other, <HI>No, my dear Si&s;ter, there is no Remedy to our
Misfortunes, we mu&s;t die, or get them out of the Clutches of
this villanous Dotard. I am re&s;olute for any thing,</HI> replyed the
o$her, in uttering a deep &s;igh&punc; <HI>&s;hould it co&s;t me my Life: What
remains? Have we not &s;acrificed all for them?</HI> Then con&s;idering
a while their Misfortunes, they mutually embraced, and began
to weep in a mo&s;t pitious manner: And having con&s;ulted a
while, and &s;pake &s;ome other Words, the greate&s;t part of which
were interrupted by their Sighs, they concluded on Writing,
which they did, and here is mo&s;t of what I heard them read
to one another:</P>
<P>Judge not of my Love and Grief by my Words, I have none can
expre&s;s either the one or the other; but remember you Ruine me,
<PB N="12" REF="15">
unle&s;s you betake him&s;elf to the greate&s;t Extremities again&s;t him
that per&s;ecutes us. He has now &s;ent me word, <HI>That if we delay
our Departure, he will have us &s;eized.</HI> Con&s;ider what he de&s;erves
from this ba&s;e &V;&s;age of us; and remember you owe me all, &s;eeing
you owe me my Heart.</P>
<P>I think the other Billet was in the&s;e Terms,</P>
<P>Could I &s;ecure thee thy Happine&s;s, in lo&s;ing mine, I love thee
&s;ufficiently to offer thee &s;uch a Sacrifice. Yes, I would fly from
thee, could&s;t thou be Happy without me; but I know thy Heart
too well to believe this. Yet thou remaine&s;t as Quiet in thy Pri|&s;on,
as if I were with thee. Break thy Chains without more de|lay;
puni&s;h the Enemy of our Loves. My Heart &s;hall be thy Recom|pen&s;e.</P>
<P>Having made up the&s;e Billets, they went out together, and
I profe&s;s, I was not a little unea&s;ie for them, and no le&s;s curious
to know the&s;e poor Ladies Misfortunes. This hindred me from
&s;leeping, and I was expecting their Return, when immediate|ly
there was a great Uproar in the Hou&s;e. I &s;aw an old Man
enter the Chamber attended by a great many Servants. He
held one of the&s;e young Women by the Hair of the Head,
which he had wound about his Arm, and drew her after him,
as a wretched Sacrifice. Her Si&s;ter was not treated with le&s;s
Cruelty, by tho&s;e who led her. <HI>Perfidious Wretches,</HI> &s;aid he to
them, <HI>not content with the irreparable Injury you do my Nephews,
you would per&s;wade them to be my Executioners? Had I not &s;urpri|&s;ed
you with the&s;e &s;educing Letters what might have hapned? what
dreadful Tragedies might I not have expected? But you &s;hall pay
once for all: as &s;oon as ever the Day appears I will have you puni&s;ht
as you de&s;erve. Ah Sir,</HI> &s;aid &s;he whom he held, <HI>remember we are
Women of Quality, and that our Alliance can be no Di&s;honour to you,
that your Nephews have given us their Faith, and we them ours,
that in &s;o tender an Age we have left all for their &s;akes; that we
are &s;trangers, and have no Friends here: What will become of us?
We dare not return to our Relations: if you are for con&s;training us
to this, or for putting us in Pri&s;on, let us intreat you rather pre&s;ently
to di&s;patch us out of the World.</HI></P>
<P>The Tears which they &s;hed in &s;uch abundance, wrought in
me the greate&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion: And had the old Man been as
tender as I, he had &s;oon freed them from their Trouble.</P>
<P>My Women, who had heard &s;uch a great Di&s;turbance, and
&s;o near my Chamber, aro&s;e, in the fear of &s;ome Mi&s;hap to|wards
me. I made Signs to them to draw near &s;oftly, and
to behold through the Boards this &s;orrowful Spectacle. We
hearkened to what they &s;aid, when two Men, with their Swords
<PB N="13" REF="16">
in their Hands, entred into my Chamber, the Door of which
my Women had left open: They had De&s;pair painted on their
Faces, and Rage in their Eyes: I was &s;o greatly frighted that I
cannot expre&s;s it to you. They looked on one another with|out
&s;peaking a word; and having heard the old Man's Voice,
they ran on that &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>I did not doubt but 'twas the two Lovers; and 'twas them
indeed, who entred like two Lions into this Chamber: They
&s;truck the&s;e Servants with &s;o great Terror, that never a one of
'em dared approach his Ma&s;ter, to defend him, when his Ne|phews
advance towards him, and &s;et their Swords to his Throat:</HI>
Barbarian, <HI>&s;aid they to him,</HI> can you thus u&s;e Women of Quality,
that are to be our Wives? Becau&s;e you are our Gardian, mu&s;t you
therefore be our Tyrant? And is not the &s;eparating of us from what
we love, the taking of our Lives from us? It's now in our Power
to take a ju&s;t Vengeance of you; but we cannot do it to a Man of
your Age, who cannot defend him&s;elf: give us then your Word, and
&s;wear by all that's Good and Holy, That in Acknowledgment for the
Life we give you, you will contribute to our Happine&s;s, and &s;uffer us
to perform what we have promis'd.</P>
<P>The poor old Wretch was &s;o afrighted, that he could hardly
make any An&s;wer; However, he &s;wore more than they would
have him; he fell on his Knees, and ki&s;t an hundred times his
Thumb laid a-cro&s;s one of his Fingers, after the manner of <HI>Spain.</HI>
Yet he told them, <HI>whatever he had done, was only in regard to
their Intere&s;ts; however, he would not in any &s;ort, for the future,
oppo&s;e their Inclinations, in reference to this Marriage.</HI> Two of
the Dome&s;ticks took him under the Arm, and rather carried him
away than led him. Then the Gentlemen &s;eeing them&s;elves
free, threw them&s;elves in their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Arms; they &s;aid to
one another, whatever Grief, Love and Joy do u&s;ually in&s;pire
in &s;uch Occa&s;ions. But in Truth, one mu&s;t have a Heart as af|fected
and content as theirs, to repeat all the&s;e things: they are
only proper to Per&s;ons more tender than you are, my dear Co&s;en.
But I hope you will excu&s;e this Relation; I was &s;o tired, in ha|ving
not yet &s;lept, that I could &s;carce hear any more, but confu|&s;edly:
and to hear no more, I got farther into bed, and threw
the Quilt over my Head.</P>
<P>The next Morning <HI>Don Fernando de Toledo,</HI> &s;ent me &s;ome choice
Wines, with great quantity of Oranges and Sweet-meats. As &s;oon
as he thought it a proper time to Vi&s;it me, he came: Having
thankt him for his Pre&s;ent, I ask'd him, Whether he had heard
nothing of what had pa&s;t in the Night? He told me, <HI>No,</HI> for
he had lain in another part of the Hou&s;e. I was about relating
<PB N="14" REF="17">
to him what I knew, when our Ho&s;te&s;s entred into the Cham|ber:
&s;he came from the Two Gentlemen who had given me that
Di&s;turbance, with the Swords in their Hands, intreating me to
receive their Excu&s;es. She likewi&s;e told me, that two young
Ladies de&s;ired they might wait on me, and ki&s;s my Hand. I
an&s;wer'd the&s;e Civilities as I ought; and they &s;oon entred.</P>
<P><HI>What charming effects does the Return of Joy pro|duce?
I found the&s;e Gentlemen very well &s;haped, and the&s;e
Ladies very lovely; neither one nor the other had any more
on their Countenances the Characters of De&s;pair; an Air of
Gaiety di&s;play'd it &s;elf in all their words and ge&s;tures. The
Elde&s;t of the two Brethren made the mo&s;t hand&s;ome Excu&s;e
as is po&s;&s;ible for his Mi&s;take in entring my Chamber: he ad|ded,
&startq;He had well ob&s;erv'd the Fear he had caus'd me; but
told me, that in that Moment he was &s;o tran&s;ported, that
he was capable of no other Thought but the Re&s;cuing his
Mi&s;tre&s;s.&endq;</HI> You would have been to blame, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> &s;hould
you have thought of any thing el&s;e: However, if it be true, you
are willing, to make me Satisfaction for the Alarum you have
giv'n me, you mu&s;t not refu&s;e the gratifying my Curio&s;ity? With the&s;e
fair Ladies leave, inform me what has reduced all of you to the&s;e
Extremities you were in. <HI>He lookt on them, as if it were to
ask their Approbation, which they willingly granted; and he
thus began:</HI> We are two Brothers, Madam, Natives of <HI>Burgos,</HI>
and one of the be&s;t Families of this City. We were very young,
when we fell into the Hands of an &V;ncle, who took care of our
Education and E&s;tates, which are &s;o con&s;iderable, that we need
not envy others on that account. <HI>Don Diego</HI> (is our &V;ncle's
Name) he had made long &s;ince a firm Friend&s;hip with a Gentle|man
living near <HI>Blaye,</HI> who&s;e Merit is far above his Fortune, he
is call'd <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Me&s;&s;ignac:</HI> Our &V;ncle re&s;olving to &s;end us
for &s;ome time into <HI>France,</HI> he wrote hereupon to his Friend, who
offered him his Hou&s;e, which he joyfully accepted. He made us
&s;et out, and it is a Year &s;ince we were receiv'd there with great
Civility; <HI>Madam de Me&s;&s;ignac</HI> u&s;ed us as her own Children; &s;he
has &s;everal, but of her four Daughters, tho&s;e you &s;ee are the mo&s;t
amiable. It would have been very difficult to have &s;een them eve|ry
day, to dwell with them, and yet not to have loved them.</P>
<P>My Brother at fir&s;t conceal'd from me his growing Pa&s;&s;ion, and
I hid mine from him; we were both of us very melancholly; the
trouble of loving, without being lov'd again, and the fear of di&s;|plea&s;ing
tho&s;e who caus'd our Pa&s;&s;ion, all this cruelly tormented
us; but a new Vexation did greatly increa&s;e our Di&s;quiet, which
was a re&s;tle&s;s Jealou&s;ie we had one of another: My Brother
<PB N="15" REF="18">
plainly &s;aw I was in Love, and thought 'twas with his Mi&s;tre&s;s;
I lookt on him likewi&s;e as my Rival; and we bore &s;uch Hatred to
one another, as might have tran&s;ported us to the greate&s;t Extre|mities:
but that I re&s;olutely determin'd one day to di&s;cover my
Sentiments to <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Me&s;&s;ignac;</HI> but wanting Courage
to &s;peak to her my &s;elf, I wrote &s;ome Ver&s;es in a little Book touch|ing
my Pa&s;&s;ion for her, and dextrou&s;ly &s;lid it into her Pocket,
without her perceiving me. My Brother who had always an Eye
on me ob&s;erv'd it, and playing with her, he took out the Ver&s;es,
and found them to contain a re&s;pectful and pa&s;&s;ionate Declaration of
Love to her: he kept them till Night, when being withdrawn
into my Chamber, with the greate&s;t Inquietude, he came to me,
and tenderly embracing me, he told me, he was heartily glad at the
notice he had of my being in love with <HI>Mademoi&s;elle de Me&s;&s;ignac.</HI></P>
<P>I remain'd as one Thunder&s;truck; I &s;aw my Papers in his Hands;
I imagin'd &s;he had made them a Sacrifice to him, and that he
came to in&s;ult on my Misfortune. He &s;aw in <HI>my</HI> Eyes and Counte|nance
part of what I thought: <HI>Undeceive your &s;elf,</HI> continued he,
<HI>&s;he gave 'em not to me; I have taken 'em without her &s;eeing
them: I'll be &s;erviceable to you for the obtaining her; be you
the &s;ame to me in relation to her elder Si&s;ter.</HI> I then embraced
him, and promi&s;ed him all he de&s;ired. Thus we mutually rendred
good Offices to one another; and our Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who were not then
acquainted with the power of Love, began to accu&s;tom them&s;elves
to hear talk of it.</P>
<P>It would be to abu&s;e your Patience, to tell you, Madam, how
we came at length by our Cares and A&s;&s;iduities to win their Hearts.
What happy Moments! what &s;weet Hours! to &s;ee without cea|&s;ing
what one loves, and to be beloved! to be together in the Fields,
where an Innocent and Country life, let's one ta&s;te, without di&s;tur|bance,
the Plea&s;ures of a growing Pa&s;&s;ion; this is a Felicity which
cannot be expre&s;t.</P>
<P>Winter being come, <HI>Madam de Me&s;&s;ignac</HI> was at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI>
where &s;he had a Hou&s;e; we accompanied her thither; but this
Hou&s;e was not great enough to lodge us, with all our Family; we
took one near hers.</P>
<P>Though this Separation was only the Nights, yet we had lively
Re&s;entments of it; we were not now every Moment with 'em; our
Vi&s;its were accompanied with a certain Air of Ceremonies, which
di&s;turb'd us. But our Alarums were much increas'd when we &s;aw
two rich hand&s;ome Sparks addre&s;s them&s;elves to <HI>Mademo&s;elles de
Me&s;&s;ignac,</HI> and earne&s;tly Court them, and that with the Appro|bation
of their Parents. Good God, how we look'd! Their Proceedings
went on at a great rate, and our dear Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, who &s;hared
<PB N="16" REF="19">
in our Sorrow, mingled every day their Tears with ours. In fine,
having throughly tormented our &s;elves, by devi&s;ing a thou&s;and fruit|le&s;s
ways, I re&s;olv'd to Addre&s;s my &s;elf to <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Me&s;&s;ig|nac:</HI>
I &s;pake to him, and told him what my Pa&s;&s;ion in&s;pired me,
to per&s;wade him to defer the&s;e Marriages. He an&s;wered, <HI>He ac|cepted,
with the greate&s;t Acknowledgments, the Offers my Bro|ther
and I made him; but being not of Age, what we might
do at pre&s;ent might be afterwards Cancel'd: That his Honour
was dear to him, though his E&s;tate was &s;mall; however, &s;hould
always e&s;teem him&s;elf Happy, in living without Reproach:
That my Uncle, who had entru&s;ted us to him, might ju&s;tly
accu&s;e him of Seducing us, and that in &s;hort, we mu&s;t no more
think of the&s;e Matters.</HI></P>
<P>I withdrew in the greate&s;t Affliction, which I &s;hared with my
Brother; and this was a dreadful trouble among us. <HI>Mon&s;ieur
de Me&s;&s;ignac,</HI> to compleat our misfortunes, &s;ent an Account to my
&V;ncle, of what had pa&s;t, and earne&s;tly intreated him to lay his
Commands on us to be gone. He did &s;o, and &s;eeing no remedy to our
Misfortunes, we went, my Brother and I, to <HI>Mademoi&s;elles
de Me&s;&s;ignac,</HI> we threw our &s;elves at her Feet; We told them,
what might per&s;wade Hearts already pre-po&s;&s;e&s;t: We gave them
our Faith and Promi&s;es, Sign'd with our Blood: In &s;hort, Love made
an end of vanqui&s;hing them; they con&s;ented to go with us. In fine, we
took &s;uch Mea&s;ures that our Pa&s;&s;age was happy enough till our
Arrival here; and it is not two days &s;ince entring this Hou&s;e, the
fir&s;t Per&s;on offering him&s;elf to us was <HI>Don Diego;</HI> He was impa|tient
of our Return; and to &s;atisfie him&s;elf, he came in que&s;t of us.
How did we look at this &s;ight! He caus'd us to be apprehended as
Criminals; and forgetting that <HI>Mademoi&s;elles de Me&s;&s;ignac,</HI>
were the Daughters of his be&s;t Friend, and Per&s;ons of Quality, he
loaded them with Injuries, and over-whelm'd them with Threat|nings;
after he had learnt from one of my Servants, that we
had re&s;olv'd to pa&s;s <HI>Incognito</HI> as far as <HI>Madrid,</HI> to &s;ome Relations
we had there, to tarry in this place for a full liberty of declaring
our Marriage. He lock't us up in a Chamber next to his; and we
were there, when the&s;e Ladies came by Moon light, coughing un|der
our Windows. We heard them, and ran to them&mdash;They &s;hew'd
us their Letters; and we were devi&s;ing on our Deliverance, when
my &V;ncle, having notice of what pa&s;t, &s;ilently came upon us with
all his Servants, and before our Faces mi&s;u&s;ed the&s;e amiable Crea|tures.
In the Exce&s;s of our De&s;pair our Strength, without doubt,
increas'd. We broke open the Doors, which were fa&s;t &s;hut on us,
and we ran to Succour them, when imprudently, Madam, we came
into your Chamber.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="20">
The Gentleman here &s;topt, and I found he had related his
little Hi&s;tory with great Ingenuity. I thank't him for it, and
offer'd the&s;e Ladies my Endeavours, and tho&s;e of my Friends, to
appea&s;e their Family: Which Offers they accepted, and te&s;tifi'd
their Acknowledgments.</P>
<P>Some Ladies of the Town, who came to &s;ee me, wou'd &s;top
me; they propo&s;ed to me to go to the Religio&s;es, who&s;e Convent
is &s;o plea&s;antly &s;ituated, that the Pro&s;pect has no Bounds: You
may &s;ee thence, at the &s;ame time, the Sea, Ships, Towns, Woods
and Fields. They &s;pake much in prai&s;e of the Voices, Beauty,
and good humour of the&s;e Religio&s;es. Add to this, that the ill
Weather was &s;o increa&s;t, and the Snow fall'n in &s;o great abun|dance,
that no body advi&s;ed me to proceed in my Journey. I
was in &s;u&s;pence a while, but the Impatience I had to be at <HI>Ma|drid,</HI>
prevail'd over all the&s;e Con&s;iderations, and I parted the
next Morning. I have receiv'd of my Banker the Money I
want.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not forget to tell you, that the Inhabitants of this
Town have a particular Priviledge, and of which they are not a
little proud; which is, That when they Treat of any Affairs
with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and that it is directly with him, he is
oblig'd to &s;peak with them bare-headed. I could not get the
Rea&s;on from 'em for this.</P>
<P>I am told I mu&s;t furni&s;h my &s;elf with good &s;tore of Provi&s;ion,
to prevent &s;tarving in &s;ome places through which we mu&s;t pa&s;s;
and Gammons of Bacon, dried Tongues, being much e&s;teem'd
in this Country, I have therefore taken up a good quantity; and
as to the re&s;t, we have &s;ufficiently provided. Now this being

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I Re-a&s;&s;ume, Dear Cou&s;en, without any Compliments, the
Sequel of my Travels: In leaving St. <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> we entred
into a very rough Way, which brings you to &s;uch terrible
&s;teep Mountains, that you cannot a&s;cend them without climb|ing;
they are call'd <HI>Sierra de</HI> St. <HI>Adrian.</HI> They &s;hew only
Precipices and Rocks, on which a puling Lover may meet
with certain Death, if he has a mind to it. Pine Trees of an
<PB N="18" REF="21">
extraordinary heighth crown the top of the&s;e Mountains. As
far as the Sight will reach you &s;ee nothing but De&s;arts, cut
with Streams clearer than Chry&s;tal. Near the highe&s;t part of
Mount St. <HI>Adrian,</HI> you meet with an elevated Rock, which
&s;eems to have been placed in the mid&s;t of the way to Block up
the Pa&s;&s;age, and thus &s;eparate <HI>Bi&s;caye</HI> from the <HI>Old Ca&s;tille.</HI></P>
<P>A tedious and painful Labour has pierced this ma&s;s of Stone
in manner of a Vault; you may walk forty or fifty Paces un|der
it, without &s;ight of Day, but what comes by the Over|tures
at each Entry, which are &s;hut by great Doors: You find
under this Vault an Inn, which is left in the Winter, by Rea|&s;on
of the Snows: You &s;ee here likewi&s;e a little Chappel of
St. <HI>Adrian,</HI> and &s;everal Caverns, where Thieves commonly re|treat;
&s;o that it is dangerous pa&s;&s;ing here without being in a
condition of Defence. When we had traver&s;t the Rock, we
&s;till a little a&s;cended, to arrive to the top of the Moun|tain,
which is held to be the highe&s;t of the <HI>Pyranea's;</HI> it
is wholly covered with great A&s;h Trees. There was never a
finer place of Solitude; the Springs run here as in the
Valleys: the &s;ight is only bounded by the Weakne&s;s of the
Eyes; Shades and Silence here reign, and the Eccho's an|&s;wers
on every &s;ide. We began afterwards to de&s;cend down
fa&s;ter than we climed up: We &s;aw in &s;ome parts little barren
Plains, many &s;andy places, and ever and anon Mountains co|vered
with great Rocks. It is not without Rea&s;on, that in
pa&s;&s;ing &s;o near, you fear, le&s;t &s;ome one of 'em &s;hould get loo&s;e,
which would certainly over-whelm one; for you &s;ee &s;ome
which are fall'n from the top, and hang in their pa&s;&s;age on
other Clefts; and the&s;e finding nothing in the way, would give
a &s;orry Diver&s;ion to a Traveller. I made all the&s;e Reflections at
my ea&s;e; for I was alone in my Litter, with my Child, who
did not at all di&s;turb my Thoughts. A River call'd <HI>&V;rrola,</HI> big
enough, but which was increa&s;ed by the Torrents, and melt|ed
Snow &s;lides along the Way, and breaks forth into parti|cular
Streams in &s;ome places, which fall with a great impetuo|&s;ity
and noi&s;e, and make a very plea&s;ant &s;ound and &s;ight.</P>
<P>We meet not here with tho&s;e fine Ca&s;tles to be &s;een on the
Banks of the <HI>Loire,</HI> which make Travellers call it the Country
of <HI>Faries.</HI> Here are on the&s;e Mountains only &s;ome Shepherds
Cottages, and &s;ome few Hovels, and at that di&s;tance, that you
mu&s;t go a great way before you can find them; yet all the&s;e
Natural Objects; though very melancholly ones, yet have
&s;omething that is very taking in them. The Snows were &s;o
high, that we had always twenty Men, who made way for us
<PB N="19" REF="22">
with Shovels. You will perhaps imagine this co&s;t me very
much; but here are &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;ht Orders, and tho&s;e &s;o
well ob&s;erv'd, that the Inhabitants of a Village are oblig'd to
meet Travellers, and be their Guides to the next; and no one
being bound to give them any thing, the le&s;t Liberality there|fore
&s;atisfies them. To this fir&s;t Care there is added another,
which is that of Ringing the Bells without cea&s;ing, to give no|tice
to Travellers, where they may retreat in &s;tormy Weather,
They told me, there had not fall'n this forty Years &s;o much
Snow as we met with, there having been no Fro&s;t for a great
while in this Province.</P>
<P>Our Troop was &s;o great, that we might count our &s;elves no
ways inferiour to tho&s;e Famous Caravans which go to <HI>Mecha;</HI>
for without reckoning my Train, and that of <HI>Don Farnand de
Toledo,</HI> there joyn'd with us near St. <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> three Knights,
with their Attendants, who return'd from their Commander|&s;hips
of St. <HI>James;</HI> there were two of this Order, and one of
that of <HI>A$cantara:</HI> The fir&s;t wear Red Cro&s;&s;es, in form of an
embroidered Sword, on their Shoulders; and he of <HI>Alcantara</HI>
had a Green one. One of the two fir&s;t is of <HI>Andalou&s;ia,</HI> the
other of <HI>Galicia,</HI> and the third of <HI>Catalonia;</HI> they are of good
Families; he of <HI>Andalou&s;ia</HI> calls him&s;elf <HI>Done&s;leve de $arvaial,</HI> he
of <HI>Galicia, Don Sancho Sanniento,</HI> and the other of <HI>Cata|lonia,
Don Frederic de Cardonne;</HI> they are Per&s;ons of good
Mein, and well acquainted with the World. I receiv'd all po&s;|&s;ible
Civilities from them, having much of the <HI>French</HI> Humour
in them. They have travelled over the greate&s;t Part of <HI>Europe;</HI>
and this has rendred them &s;o Polite. We went to lye at <HI>Gala|reta;</HI>
this is a Borough a little di&s;tant from Mount <HI>Adrian,</HI>
&s;ituated in the little Province of <HI>Spain,</HI> I now mention'd, na|med
<HI>Alava,</HI> which makes a Part of <HI>Bi&s;caye,</HI> we had there but
bad Entertainment. They reckon it eleven Leagues from
thence to St. <HI>Seba&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>We had better way from <HI>Galareta</HI> to <HI>Victoria</HI> than we had
before: The Country here yields much Corn and Grapes; and
the Villages lie very thick together: We found here Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e-Men,
who made us pay both for the Cloaths and Money
we carried with us: they were not very exacting with us, be|cau&s;e
our Company was too large to be impo&s;ed on. <HI>Don Fer|nand
de Toledo</HI> had inform'd me over Night, that we were to
travel near the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Quebare,</HI> which was &s;aid to be haunt|ed
with a Spirit, telling me a thou&s;and extravagant Stories,
which were readily &s;wallow'd by the Inhabitants of the Country,
and which were &s;o effectually believ'd by them, that no body
<PB N="20" REF="23">
would live there. I had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee this place; for
although I am naturally as fearful as another, yet am not afraid
of Gho&s;ts; and if I were, our Company was &s;o numerous, as
would animate the greate&s;t Coward: we &s;truck off a little to
the left, and came to the Borough of <HI>Quebara;</HI> the Ma&s;ter of
the Inn where we entred, had the Keys of the Ca&s;tle; he told
us, in going along with us, <HI>That the</HI> Duende, which is to &s;ay
$he Spirit, <HI>could not endure Company; yet if we were a thou&s;and
together, he would, if he were minded, beat us all, in &s;uch a
manner, as to leave us for dead.</HI> I began to tremble; <HI>Don Fer|nand
de Toledo,</HI> and <HI>Don Frederic de Cardonne,</HI> who gave me their
Hands, perceiving my Fear, bur&s;t out into Laughter: I grew a|&s;ham'd,
and pretended to gain Courage; and &s;o we entred the
Ca&s;tle, which might have pa&s;t for a fine one, had it been kept
in order: it had no Furniture, except an old Tapi&s;try Hanging
in a great Hall, which repre&s;ented the Amours of <HI>Don Pedro the
Cruel,</HI> and <HI>Donna Maria de Padilla:</HI> &s;he is repre&s;ented &s;itting
like a Queen in the mid&s;t of other Ladies, and the King placing
on $her Head a Crown of Flowers: In another part &s;he &s;ate un|der
the &s;hade of a Wood, the King &s;hewing her a Hawk on his
Fi&s;t: And again, in another, &s;he appears in a Warrier's Dre&s;s,
and the King in Armour pre&s;ents her with a Sword; which
makes me believe that &s;he had been in &s;ome Warlike Expedi|tion
with him. She was very ill repre&s;ented; and <HI>Don Fernand</HI>
told me, &startq;He had &s;een her Effigies el&s;ewhere, by which &s;he ap|peared
to be the mo&s;t beautiful and mo&s;t cruel Woman of her
time; and that the Figures in this Tapi&s;try re&s;embled nei|ther
her nor the King, his Name, Cypher and Arms were eve|ry
where on it.&endq; We went up into a Tower, on the top of
which was a Dungeon, and 'twas there where the Spirit inha|bited;
but without doubt he was abroad, for we neither &s;aw nor
heard him, or any of his Companions; and having &s;een
&s;ufficiently this great Building, we left it to pur&s;ue our Journey.
In approaching <HI>Victoria,</HI> we pa&s;t over a mo&s;t delightful Plain,
at the end of which &s;$ands a Town &s;ituated in this Province of
<HI>Spain,</HI> I lately mention'd, call'd <HI>Alava;</HI> this is the Capital
Town of it, as well as the fir&s;t of <HI>Ca&s;tille:</HI> It is inclo&s;ed with
two Walls, one of which is old, and the other new; be&s;ides
this, it has no other Fortifications. After I had refre&s;h'd my
&s;elf a while here, 'twas propo&s;ed to me to go to a Play, but in
tarrying till it began, I had no &s;mall Diver&s;ion, in &s;eeing come
into the mo&s;t &s;pacious place of the Town, four Companies of
young Men, preceded by Drums and Trumpets, they marched
&s;everal times round, and in fine, immediately began the Fight
<PB N="21" REF="24">
with Snow-balls, which they threw on one another with &s;uch
Fiercene&s;s, that they were all very well pelted in the end: they
were above two hundred who fought this Battle. To tell you
of tho&s;e who fell, or recovered their Feet again, and the Shouts
and Acclamations of the People, will be needle&s;s; and I was
obliged to leave them thus engaged, to go to the place where
the Play was to be repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>When I entred into the Room, the People &s;et forth an hol|lowing,
<HI>Mira, mira!</HI> which is to &s;ay, Look, look! The Decorati|on
of the Theatre was not over Magnificent; it was rais'd on
Barrels, and ill-rang'd Planks; the Windows of the Room
were open, for they u&s;ed no Candles or Flambeaux; whence
you may ea&s;ily imagine this much takes away from the Beauty
of the Sight, They acted the Life of St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> and when
the Players &s;aid any thing which pleas'd the Company, all the
People cryed out, <HI>Victoria, Victoria;</HI> I was informed this was
the Cu&s;tom of the Country. I ob&s;erv'd the Devil was no other
ways clad, than the re&s;t, having only a pair of Stockins of a
Flame-colour, and a pair of Horns to di&s;tingui&s;h him. This
Comedy con&s;i&s;ted only of three Acts, and they are all no more:
at the end of which &s;erious Act, another began of Farce and
Plea&s;antry, wherein appear'd him they called <HI>El Gracio&s;a,</HI> which
is to &s;ay, the Buffoon, who, among much in&s;ipid Stuff, &s;ays
&s;ometimes &s;omething that is le&s;s nau&s;eous: The Interludes were
mixt with Dances, to the &s;ound of the Harps and Guitars:
The Actors had Ca&s;tagnets, and a little Hat on their Heads,
without which they never Dance, and then 'tis a Saraband;
they &s;eem not to walk, they &s;lip along &s;o lightly. Their man|ner
is wholly different from ours: they move too much their
Arms, and often pa&s;s their Hands on their Hats and Face&punc;
and that
with no ill Grace; they play admirable well on the Ca&s;tagnets.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t, (dear Co&s;en) I would not have you think
the&s;e Actors, for being in a little City, do much differ from
tho&s;e of <HI>Madrid.</HI> I was told, that tho&s;e of the King are a
little better; but in a word, both act what they call <HI>Las Come|dias
Famo&s;as,</HI> which is to &s;ay, The fine&s;t and mo&s;t famous
Comedies; which in truth are very ridiculous: For Example,
when St. <HI>Anthony</HI> &s;aid his <HI>Confiteor,</HI> which he did often enough,
all the Spectators fell down on their Knees, and gave them|&s;elves
&s;uch rude <HI>Mea Culpa's,</HI> as was enough to beat the breath
out of their Bodies.</P>
<P>Here would be a proper place to &s;peak of their Habits, but
you had better excu&s;e me till I come to <HI>Madrid,</HI> le&s;t I tire
you with Repetitions: Yet I mu&s;t tell you, that the Ladies I
<PB N="22" REF="25">
&s;ay in this company, had a prodigious quantity of Red which
begins ju&s;t under the Eye, and pa&s;&s;es from the Chin to the Ears,
and Shoulders, to their very Hands; &s;o that I never &s;aw any
Radi&s;hes of a finer Colour.</P>
<P>The Lady Governe&s;s of the Town drew near to me; &s;he ju&s;t
toucht my Cloaths, and ha&s;tily drew back her Hand, as if &s;he
had burnt her Fingers. I bid her in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> not to be afraid:
She at length familiariz'd her &s;elf, and told me, &startq;'Twas not
through fear of any thing el&s;e but of di&s;plea&s;ing me: that
'twas no new thing to her to &s;ee <HI>French</HI> Ladies: and that if
&s;he might,&endq; &s;he would gladly dre&s;s her &s;elf after their fa&s;hion.
She ordered Chocolate to be brought her, with which &s;he pre|&s;ented
me; which is far better here than in <HI>France.</HI> The Play
being ended, I took my leave of her, having thanked her for her
Civilities.</P>
<P>The next Morning, as I entred the Church to hear Ma&s;s I e&s;pi|ed
an Hermit, who had the Air of a Per&s;on of Quality, and yet
begg'd an Alms of me, with &s;uch great Humility, that I was great|ly
&s;urpriz'd at it: <HI>Don Fernand</HI> having notice of it, drew near, and
&s;aid to me, <HI>The Per&s;on whom you behold, Madam, is of an illu&s;trious
Family, and of great Merit, but his Fortune very &V;nhappy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You rai&s;e in me,</HI> &s;aid I to him, <HI>a great Curio&s;ity to know more;
and therefore I mu&s;t beg your Favour to &s;atisfie it. You may com|mand
any thing of me,</HI> replied he, <HI>Madam; but I am not &s;o
throughly inform'd of his Adventures, to undertake the relating them
to you; and I believe 'twere better I engage him into a Recital of
them him&s;elf.</HI> He left me, and went immediately to embrace
him, with the greate&s;t Civilities and Tenderne&s;s: <HI>Don Frederic
de Cardonne,</HI> and <HI>Don E&s;teve de Carvajal,</HI> had already acco&s;ted
him, as their old Acquaintance; and when <HI>Don Fernand</HI> had
join'd them, they all earne&s;tly intreated him to come with them
when Ma&s;s was over. He was earne&s;tly excu&s;ed him&s;elf; but be|ing
told, I was a Stranger and much importuned, that I might
learn from him&s;elf, what had oblig'd him to turn Hermit; he
at length con&s;ented, on condition I would permit him to
bring one of his Friends, who was perfectly knowing in what
related to him: <HI>Do us Ju&s;tice,</HI> continued he, <HI>and judge whether
'tis fit for me to relate &s;uch Particularities in this Habit I wear.</HI>
They found he had rea&s;on, and pray'd him to bring his Friend,
which he did a while after I was at my Lodgings: He pre&s;ented
a very fine Cavalier to me; and taking leave of us very civilly,
he told him, &startq;He &s;hould be oblig'd to him, if he would &s;atisfie
the Curio&s;ity which <HI>Don Fernand de Toledo</HI> had giv'n me, of
knowing the Spring of his Misfortunes. This Gentleman took
place by me, and began in the&s;e Terms:&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="26">
I think my &s;elf very Happy, Madam, that my Friend has cho&s;en
me to &s;atisfie the De&s;ire you have of knowing his Adventures; but I
fear I &s;hall not acquit my &s;elf &s;o well as I would: The Per&s;on who&s;e
Hi&s;tory you wou'd learn, has been one of the fine&s;t Gentlemen in the
World; it would be hard to make a Judgment of him now; he is
buried, as it were in his Hermit's Habit. He was an exceeding
graceful Per&s;on, well &s;haped, of an excellent Mein, and noble Air:
And in fine, had all the Accompli&s;hments, both Natural and Acqui|red,
of a Per&s;on of Quality, being liberal, witty and brave. He was
born at <HI>Cagliari,</HI> Capital of the I&s;le of <HI>Sardagne,</HI> one of the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious
and riche&s;t Families of all that Country.</P>
<P>He was brought up with one of his Co&s;en Germans; and the &s;im|pathy
which was found in their Humours, and Inclinations, was &s;o
great, that they were more &s;trictly united by Friend&s;hip than Blood:
they hid no Secret from each other. And when the Marqui&s;s <HI>Bar|baran</HI>
was married (which was his Co&s;en's Name,) their Friend&s;hip
continued in the &s;ame force.</P>
<P>He married one of the fine&s;t Women in the World, and the mo&s;t
Accompli&s;ht; &s;he was then not above Fourteen: She was Heire&s;s to
a very Noble E&s;tate and Family. The Marque&s;s every day di&s;cove|red
new Charms in the Wit and Per&s;on of his Wi&s;e, which likewi&s;e
increa&s;ed every day his Pa&s;&s;ion. He &s;peaks without cea&s;ing, of his
Happine&s;s, to <HI>Don Lewis de Barbaron;</HI> which is the Name, Madam,
of my Friend; and when any Affairs oblig'd the Marque&s;s to leave
her, he conjured him to &s;tay with the Marchione&s;s, thereby to le&s;&s;en
the Trouble of his ab&s;ence. But alas! how hard is it when one is
at an Age uncapable of &s;erious Reflections, to &s;ee continually &s;o fair
a Woman, &s;o young and aimable; and to &s;ee her with Indifference!
<HI>Don Lewis</HI> was already de&s;perately in Love with the Marchione&s;s,
and thought then 'twas only for her Husband's &s;ake: Whil&s;t he was
in this Mi&s;take, &s;he fell dangerou&s;ly &s;ick; at which he grew &s;o
dreadful melancholly, that he then knew but too late, this was
caus'd by a Pa&s;&s;ion which would prove the greate&s;t Misfortunes of
his whole Life. Finding him&s;elf then in this condition, and having
not &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t it, he re&s;olv'd to u&s;e the utmo&s;t Extremity, and
to fly and avoid a place where he was in danger of dying with Love,
or breaking through the Bonds of Friend&s;hip. The mo&s;t cruel Death
wou'd have &s;eemed gentler than the Execution of this De&s;ign: When
the Marchione&s;s beginning to grow better, he went to her to bid her
Adieu, and &s;ee her no more.</P>
<P>He found her bu&s;ied in choo&s;ing among &s;everal Stones of great
price, tho&s;e which were the fine&s;t, which &s;he intended to have &s;et
in a Ring. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was &s;carce entred the Chamber, but &s;he
de&s;ired him, with that Air of Familiarity u&s;ual among Relations,
<PB N="24" REF="27">
to go and fetch her other Stones which &s;he moreover had in her
Cabinet. He ran thither, and by an unexpected good hap, found
among what he lookt for, the Picture enamill'd of the Marchione&s;s,
in little, &s;et with Diamonds, and incircled with a Lock of her
Hair; it was &s;o like, that he had not the power to with&s;tand the
de&s;ire he had of &s;tealing it: <HI>I am going to leave her,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I
&s;hall &s;ee her no more; I &s;acrifice all my quiet to her Husband:
Alas! is not this enough? And may I not without a Crime,
&s;earch in my Pain a Con&s;olation &s;o innocent as this.</HI> He ki&s;t
&s;everal times this Picture; he put it under his Arm, he carefully
hid it, and returning towards her with the&s;e Stones, he trembling
told her the Re&s;olution he had taken of Travelling. She appear'd
much amazed at it, and chang'd her colour. He lookt on her at
this moment; he had the plea&s;ure of perceiving it; and their Eyes
being of Intelligence, &s;pake more than their Words: <HI>Alas! What
can oblige you,</HI> Don Lewis, &s;aid &s;he to him, <HI>to leave us? Your
Co&s;en loves you &s;o tenderly: I e&s;teem you, we are never pleas'd
without you, he cannot live from you: Have you not already
travelled? You have without doubt &s;ome other Rea&s;on for your
Departure, but at lea&s;t do not hide it from me. Don Lewis,</HI>
pierc'd through with &s;orrow, could not forbear uttering a deep Sigh,
and taking one of the delicate Hands, of the Charming Per&s;on, on
which he fixt his Mouth, <HI>Ah Madam, what do you ask me?</HI> &s;aid
he to her, <HI>What can I &s;ay to you? And indeed, What can I &s;ay
to you, in the Condition I am in?</HI> The Violence he u&s;ed, to conceal
his Sentiments, caus'd him &s;uch a great Weakne&s;s, that he fell half
dead at her Feet. She remained troubled and confu&s;ed at this &s;ight:
She oblig'd him to $it down by her; &s;he dared not lift up her Eyes
to look on him; but &s;he let him &s;ee Tears, which &s;he could not for|bear
&s;hedding, nor re&s;olve to conceal from him.</P>
<P>Scarcely were they come to them&s;elves, when the Marque&s;s en|tred
into the Chamber. He came to embrace <HI>Don Lewis</HI> with all
the Te&s;timonies of a perfect Friend&s;hip, and he was in the greate&s;t
trouble, when he under&s;tood he parted for <HI>Naples.</HI> He omitted no
Arguments to per&s;wade him from it, pre&s;t his &s;tay with the great|e&s;t
Earne&s;tne&s;s, but all in vain. He there immediately took his
leave of the Marchione&s;s, and &s;aw her no more. The Marque&s;s
went out with him, he left him not till the moment of his De|p$rture.
This was an Augmentation of <HI>Don Lewis</HI>'s Sorrow, he
would have willingly remained alone to have an intire Liberty of
afflicting him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s was &s;en&s;ibly afflicted at this Separation: She
had perceived he loved her, before he had known thus much him&s;elf,
and &s;he had found in him &s;uch &s;ingular Merit, that for her part
<PB N="25" REF="28">
too &s;he had loved him without knowing it; but &s;he found this to her
Co&s;t after his Departure: Recovering but lately from a dangerous
Sickne&s;s, of which &s;he was not perfectly cured, this unhappy Acci|dent
made her fall into a langui&s;hing Indi&s;po&s;ition, as &s;oon rendred
her quite another body, her Duty, her Rea&s;on, her Vertue equally
per&s;ecuted her: She was greatly &s;en&s;ible of her Husbands Re&s;pects
to her, and &s;he could not &s;uffer but with great Sorrow, that ano|ther
&s;hould take up her thoughts, and have &s;o great a place in her
Affections. She dared not any more mention the Name of <HI>Don
Lewis,</HI> &s;he never made any Inquiries after him, &s;he made it an
indi&s;pen&s;able Duty to forget him: This Violence which &s;he u&s;ed on
her &s;elf, was like a continual Martyrdom; &s;he made one of her Wo|men,
in whom &s;he mo&s;t confided, the Repo&s;itory of this Secret:
<HI>Am I not very unhappy?</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>I mu&s;t wi&s;h never again to
&s;ee a Man, towards whom it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to be in a &s;tate
of Indifference; his Per&s;on is always before mine Eyes, nay,
I think &s;ometimes I &s;ee him in the Per&s;on of my Husband, the
Re&s;emblance which is between them, &s;erves only to nouri&s;h my
Affection towards him. Alas!</HI> Mariana, <HI>I mu&s;t die, to expi|ate
this Crime, although it be an involuntary one: I have on|ly
this means to get rid of a Pa&s;&s;ion of which I cannot hither|to
be Mi&s;tre&s;s: Alas, what have I not done to &s;tifle it, this
Pa&s;&s;ion which yet is dear to me.</HI> She accompany'd the&s;e Words
with a thou&s;and Sighs: She melted into Tears, and though this
Woman had a great deal of Wit and Affection to her Mi&s;tre&s;s, yet
&s;he could &s;ay nothing to her, could yield her any Comfort.</P>
<P><HI>The Marque&s;s in the mean time, every day reproacht his Wife
with her Indifferency to</HI> Don Lewis: I cannot &s;uffer, <HI>&s;aid he to
her,</HI> that you &s;hould think &s;o little on the Man I love above
all the World, and who had &s;o much Complai&s;ance and Friend|&s;hip
for you: I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, this is a kind of Hardne&s;s, which
would make one judge untowardly of the Tenderne&s;s of your
Heart: At lea&s;t, you mu&s;t grant, Madam, that he was &s;carce|ly
gone, but you forgot him. What good would my remem|bring
him do him? <HI>&s;aid the Marchione&s;s with a langui&s;hing Air,</HI>
Do not you &s;ee he avoids us? Would he not have been &s;till
with us, if he had any real Kindne&s;s for us? Believe me, my
Lord, he de&s;erves a little that we &s;hould for&s;ake him in our turn.
<HI>Whatever &s;he could &s;ay, repel'd not the Marque&s;s; he &s;till impor|turn'd
her to write to</HI> Don Lewis <HI>to Return. One Day among the
re&s;t, &s;he was gotten into his Clo&s;et to &s;peak to him about &s;ome Af|fairs,
&s;he found him bu&s;ied in reading a Letter of</HI> Don Lewis <HI>which
he lately receiv'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>She would have retir'd; but he took this opportunity to oblige her
<PB N="26" REF="29">
to do what he would have her; he told her very &s;eriou&s;ly,</HI> That
he could no longer bear the Ab&s;ence of his Co&s;en; that he was
re&s;olved to go find him; that 'twas already two Years &s;ince
he had been gone, without intimating any de&s;ire of returning
to his Friends and Country; that he was per&s;waded he would
yield a greater Deference to her Reque&s;ts than his; that he con|jured
her to write to him: And that in fine, &s;he might chu&s;e
either to give him this Satisfaction, or be content to &s;ee him
part for <HI>Naples,</HI> where <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was to make &s;ome &s;tay. <HI>She
remain'd &s;urprized, and perplext at this Propo&s;al; but knowing he
expected with great Impatience her Determination,</HI> What would
you have me &s;ay to him, my Lord? <HI>&s;aid &s;he to him with a &s;or|rowful
Countenance,</HI> Dictate this Letter to me, I will write it?
I can do no more; and I believe this is more than I ought. <HI>The
Marque&s;s, tran&s;ported with Joy, mo&s;t affectionately embrac'd her;
he thank'd her for her Compliance and made her write the&s;e Words:</HI></P>
<P>IF you have any Kindne&s;s for us, defer not your Return; I
have very urgent Rea&s;ons to de&s;ire it. I am not a little con|cern'd
that you &s;hew &s;uch Indifference towards us, which is an
unque&s;tionable Indication that you take no Delight in our Com|pany.
Return, <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> I earne&s;tly wi&s;h it; I intreat you:
And if it were fit for me to u&s;e more urgent Terms, I would &s;ay
perhaps, I command you to do it.</P>
<P><HI>The Marque&s;s made a &s;ingle Pacquet of this fatal Letter, to
the end</HI> Don Lewis <HI>might not think 'twas by his Order the Mar|chione&s;s
had wrote it; and having &s;ent it to the Carrier, he ex|pected
the Succe&s;s with extraordinary Impatience. What became
of this Lover at the &s;ight of &s;o dear and unexpected an Order!
Although he had remarkt Di&s;po&s;itions of Tenderne&s;s in the Coun|tenance
of this fair Per&s;on, yet he dared not promi&s;e him&s;elf &s;he
could de&s;ire his return; his Rea&s;on revolted again&s;t his Joy:</HI> How
Unhappy a Wretch I am? <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I Adore the mo&s;t Amiable
of all Women, and yet I dare not offer to plea&s;e her? &s;he has
a Kindne&s;s for me, yet Honour and Friend&s;hip with-hold me
from making the lea&s;t Advantage of it. What &s;hall I do then,
O Heavens! What &s;hall I do! I flatter'd my &s;elf, that Ab&s;ence
would cure me, Alas! this is a Remedy which I have fruit|le&s;ly
tried; I have never ca&s;t mine Eyes on her Picture, but
have found my &s;elf more in Love, and more Mi&s;erable than
when I &s;aw her every day. I mu&s;t obey her, &s;he commands my
Return; &s;he de&s;ires to &s;ee me, and &s;he cannot be ignorant of
my Pa&s;&s;ion: When I took my Leave of her, my Eyes decla|red
<PB N="27" REF="30">
to her the Secret of my Heart: And when I call to mind
what I &s;aw in hers, all my Reflections then are to no purpo&s;e; for
I re&s;olve rather to die at her Feet, than to live remote from her.</P>
<P>He parted without any delay, and without taking leave of his
Friends. He left a Gentleman to Excu&s;e him towards them, and to
order his Affairs. He was in &s;uch great ha&s;te to &s;ee the Marchione&s;s,
that he u&s;ed &s;uch Diligence to be with her, that no body but he could
have done: arriving at <HI>Cagliary,</HI> Capital of <HI>Sardagne,</HI> he under|&s;tood
that the Marque&s;s and his Wife were at a &s;tately Country-hou&s;e,
where the Vice-Roy was gone to give them a Vi&s;it, with all his Court.
He learnt moreover, that the Marque&s;s de <HI>Barbaran</HI> prepared for
him a great Fea&s;t, where there were to be held Ju&s;ts or Turnaments
after the Ancient Manner of the <HI>Mores:</HI> He was the Defendant,
and was to maintain, <HI>That a Husband beloved, is Happier than a
Lover.</HI></P>
<P>Several Gentlemen that were not of this Opinion, were preparing
them&s;elves to go and di&s;pute the Prize, which the Marchione&s;s, at
the Vice-Queen's Intreaty, was to give to the Conqueror; 'Twas a
Scarf embroidered with her own Hands wrought with Cyphers: No
one was to appear but maskt and di&s;gui&s;ed, to the end all might be
freer and more gallant.</P>
<P><HI>Don Lewis</HI> had a &s;ecret De&s;pight, in comprehending the Marque&s;s
&s;o well &s;atisfied, <HI>He is belov'd,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I cannot but look on him
as my Rival, and as an Happy Rival; but we mu&s;t endeavour to
di&s;turb his Happine&s;s, in triumphing over his vain Glory.</HI> Ha|ving
formed this De&s;ign, he would not appear in Town; he caus'd
to be made a Suit of &s;trip'd Green Satan, embroidered with Gold,
and all his Liveries were of the &s;ame Colour, to denote his new
hopes.</P>
<P>When he entred into the Li&s;ts, every body had their Eyes on him;
his Magnificence and his Air gave Emulation to the Cavaliers, and
great Curio&s;ities to the Ladies. The Marchione&s;s felt a &s;ecret E|motion,
of which &s;he could not di&s;cover the Cau&s;e: He was placed
very near the Belcony, where &s;he &s;ate with the Vice-Queen; but
there was no Lady there which did not lo&s;e all her Lu&s;tre near that
of the Marchione&s;s; her youthful Air, which exceeded not eighteen
Years, her lovely white and red Cheeks, her Eyes &s;o &s;weet and grace|ful,
her Scarlet and little Mouth, agreeable Smile, and her Shape,
which &s;urpa&s;t the Faire&s;t, made her the Admiration of all the
World.</P>
<P><HI>Don Lewis</HI> was &s;o ravi&s;h'd in &s;eeing her &s;o charming, and to ob|&s;erve
yet in her Countenance a langui&s;hing &s;orrowful Air, that he
flattered him&s;elf to have therein a part, and this was the fir&s;t
Moment wh$$ein he thought him&s;elf Happy. When his turn came,
<PB N="28" REF="31">
he ran again&s;t the Marque&s;s, and &s;mote him &s;o dextrou&s;ly, that he got
the Advantage all along of him: &s;o that in a word, he gain'd the
Prize with a general Applau&s;e, and with every one's good liking.
He threw him&s;elf at the Marchione&s;s's Feet, to receive it at her
Hands; he altered the Tone of his Voice, and &s;peaking to her with
his Mask on, low enough not to be heard but only by her: <HI>Divine
Per&s;on,</HI> &s;aid he to her, <HI>be pleas'd to ob&s;erve what Fortune de|cides
in favour of Lovers.</HI> He dar'd not to &s;ay more to her; and
without knowing him, &s;he gave him the Prize, with the natural
Grace with which all her Actions were accompanied.</P>
<P>He &s;uddenly withdrew him&s;elf, for fear of being known; for this
might have been an occa&s;ion of Quarrel between the Marque&s;s and
him: and without doubt he would not have ea&s;ily pardon'd the Victo|ry
he obtain'd over him This oblig'd him to keep him&s;elf &s;till con|ceal'd
for &s;ome Days. The Vice-Roy and his Lady return'd to <HI>Cagli|ary,</HI>
and the Marque&s;s and Marchione&s;s accompanied them thither,
with the whole Court.</P>
<P>Don Lewis <HI>then &s;hew'd him&s;elf; he pretended he ju&s;t then ar|riv'd,
and made as if he knew not what had pa&s;t in the Field.
The Marque&s;s</HI> de Barbaran <HI>was tran&s;ported with Joy in &s;eeing him:
and Ab&s;ence had not at all altered the Affection, he had for this dear
Relation. He had no difficult task to find a favourable moment
wherein to entertain his amiable Marchione&s;s, he had as much liber|ty
in their Lodgings as in his own; and you may well judge, Madam,
that he forgot not to mention the Prize he had receiv'd from her fair
Hands:</HI> How wretched am I, <HI>&s;aid he to her,</HI> that you did not
know me? Alas, Madam, I flattered my &s;elf, that by &s;ome &s;e|cret
Pre&s;entiments you would learn that no one but I could &s;u|&s;tain
with &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ion the Cau&s;e of Lovers again&s;t Husbands
No my Lord, <HI>&s;aid &s;he to him, with an Angry and Di&s;dainful Air
to take away all Hope from him,</HI> I could never have imagin'd
that you could have been Patroon of &s;o foul a Cau&s;e; and I could
not have believ'd you could have taken &s;uch &s;trong Engage|ments
at <HI>Naples,</HI> that you &s;hould come as far as <HI>Sardagne</HI> to
Triumph over a Friend who maintain'd my Intere&s;ts as well as
his own. I &s;hall die with Regret, Madam, <HI>&s;aid</HI> Don Lewis, if $
have displeas'd you in what I have done; and were you more
favourably di&s;po&s;ed, and I might dare to make you my Confi|dent,
it would be no hard matter for me to per&s;wade you, tha$
it is not at <HI>Naples</HI> I have left the Object of my Vows.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s apprehending lea&s;t he &s;hould &s;peak more than &s;h$
was willing to hear, and appear livelily toucht with the Reproac$
&s;he made him, &s;he put on a more plea&s;ing Countenance, and tur$|ing
<PB N="29" REF="32">
the Conver&s;ation into a Tone of Railery, an&s;wer'd him, <HI>He took
too &s;eriou&s;ly what &s;he had &s;aid to him.</HI> He dared not make u&s;e of
this occa&s;ion to declare his Love to her; for though he lov'd her above
all things, yet he re&s;pected her no le&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>When he had left her, he began to blame him&s;elf for his Fearfulne&s;s:</HI>
Shall I, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> always &s;uffer without &s;eeking any Remedy! <HI>It was
&s;ome time before he could meet with a favourable occa&s;ion, becau&s;e the
Marchione&s;s &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided him; but being come one Night where
&s;he was, he found her alone in an inward Room, lying on a bed in a
mo&s;t lovely manner, and mo&s;t becoming &V;ndre&s;s, her Hair being fa&s;t|ned
with Knots of Diamonds, hung carele&s;ly about her Brea&s;ts: The
Trouble &s;he felt in &s;eeing</HI> Don Lewis, <HI>appear'd on her Countenance,
and rendred her yet more lovely: He drew near her with an Awful
and re&s;pectful Air, fell down on his Knees by her; he lookt on her
for &s;ome time, not daring to &s;peak; but becoming a little more bold,</HI>
If you con&s;ider, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he to her,</HI> the pitious Condition
whereunto you have reduced me, you will ea&s;ily comprehend
that it is no longer in my power to keep Silence: I could not a|void
&s;uch inevitable Stroaks as you have given me; I have ado|red
you as &s;oon as I &s;aw you: I have endeavour'd to Cure my
&s;elf in flying from you; I have offered the greate&s;t Violence to
my &s;elf, in endeavouring to ma&s;ter my Pa&s;&s;ion. You have re|call'd
me, Madam, from my Voluntary Exile, and I die a
thou&s;and times a Day, uncertain of my De&s;tiny: If you
be Cruel enough to refu&s;e me your Pity, &s;uffer at lea&s;t,
that having made known to you my Pa&s;&s;ion, I may die
with Crief at your Feet. <HI>The Marchione&s;s was &s;ome time
without re&s;olving to an&s;wer him; but at length, gaining a&s;&s;u|rance,</HI>
I acknowledge, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, Don Lewis,</HI> that I am not
wholly ignorant of one part of your Sentiments, but I was wil|ling
to per&s;wade my &s;elf 'twas the Effects of an Innocent affecti|on:
Make me not a Partner of your Crime; you commit one,
when you betray the Friend&s;hip due to my Husband: But, alas,
you will pay but too dearly for this; for I know that Duty forbids
you to Love me; and in re&s;pect, it does not only forbid me to
love you, but to fly from you: I will do it, <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> I will a|void
you; and I do not know, whether I ought not to Hate you.
But, alas, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to me to do it. What do you then,
Madam, <HI>an&s;wer'd he, interrupting her, being full of Grief and De|&s;pair,</HI>
when you pronounce the Sentence of my Death? You can|not
Hate me &s;ay you: Do you not hate me, and do you not do
me all the Mi&s;chief you are able, when you re&s;olve to avoid me?
Make an end, Madam, make an end, leave not your Venge|ance
<PB N="30" REF="33">
imperfect; &s;acrifice me to your Duty, and your Husband;
for my Life cannot but be odious, if you take from me the
Hopes of plea&s;ing you. <HI>She lookt on him at this in&s;tant with
Eyes full of langui&s;hing: Don Lewis, &s;aid &s;he to him,</HI> you re|proach
me with what I would de&s;erve. <HI>In ending the&s;e words,
&s;he aro&s;e, fearing greatly, le&s;t her Affection &s;hould triumph over
her Rea&s;on; and notwith&s;tanding his endeavours to with-hold her,
&s;he pa&s;t into a Chamber where her Women were.</HI></P>
<P>She thought &s;he had gained much on her &s;elf in forcing her way
out of this Conver&s;ation, without an&s;wering &s;o favourably as her
Heart could have wi&s;ht; but Love is a Seducer, which mu&s;t not
be in any &s;ort hearkened to, if one will not be totally overcome by
him. From that day <HI>Don Lewis</HI> began to think him&s;elf Happy,
though he wanted many things to compleat his Felicity. The Mar|chione&s;s,
in effect, had a Principle of Virtue, which oppo&s;ed it &s;elf al|ways
with Succe&s;s to the de&s;ires of her Lover.</P>
<P>He had no longer tho&s;e Scruples of Friend&s;hip for the Marque&s;s <HI>de
Barbaran</HI> which had &s;o greatly di&s;turbed his Mind; Love had per|fectly
bani&s;ht Friend&s;hip; nay, he even &s;ecretly hated him.</P>
<P>In fine, <HI>Don Lewis,</HI> flattering him&s;elf, that perhaps he might find
a favourable moment to affect the Marchione&s;s's Heart with &s;ome Pi|ty;
he carefully &s;ought it; and to find it, when one day when 'twas
very hot, knowing that the Marchione&s;s was wont to retire to Repo&s;e
her &s;elf after Dinner, as it is cu&s;tomary, in that Country, he came to
her, doubting not but every body was a&s;leep in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>She was in a Ground-Room which lookt into the Garden; all was
fa&s;t and &s;hut clo&s;e, &s;ave a little Window, whereby he &s;aw on her Bed
this Charming Creature: She was in a profound Sleep, half un|dre&s;t;
he had the time to di&s;cover &s;uch Beauties as &s;till augment|ed
the force of his Pa&s;&s;ion. He approacht &s;o &s;oftly to her, that &s;he
did not awake: It was already &s;ome moments that he had lookt
on her with all the Tran&s;ports of a Man amazed, when &s;eeing her
naked Brea&s;ts, he could not forbear ki&s;&s;ing them. She aro&s;e on a
&s;udden, &s;he had not her Eyes open, the Chamber was dark, and
&s;he could never have believ'd <HI>Don Lewis</HI> could have been &s;o bold.
I have already told you, Madam, that he re&s;embled the Marque&s;s
<HI>de Barbaran:</HI> She did not doubt then but it was he, and calling
him &s;everal times, <HI>her dear Marque&s;s and Husband,</HI> &s;he tenderly
embrac'd him. He well knew his Error, whatever Plea&s;ure it
procured him, he could have wi&s;hed to have ow'd this only to his
Mi&s;tre&s;s's Favours. But, O Heavens, how unfortunately it hap|$ed!
The Marque&s;s came in this dangerous moment; and
'twas not without the greate&s;t fury he &s;aw the Liberty <HI>Don
Lewis</HI> took with his Wife. At the noi&s;e he had made in entring,
<PB N="31" REF="34">
&s;he had turn'd her Eyes towards the Door, and &s;eeing her Husband
enter, whom &s;he thought &s;he had already in her Arms, it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to repre&s;ent her Affliction and A&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Don Lewis</HI> amaz'd at this Accident, flatter'd him&s;elf, that per|haps
he was not known: He pa&s;t immediately into the Gallery, and
finding a Window was opened into the Garden, he threw him&s;elf
out of it, and immediately pa&s;t through a Back-door. The Mar|que&s;s
pur&s;ued him, without being able to overtake him: In return|ing
the &s;ame way he came, he unhappily found the Marchione&s;s's
Picture, which <HI>Don Lewis</HI> had dropt as he ran; he immediately
made mo&s;t cruel Reflections hereupon: This Picture of his Wife,
which <HI>Don Lewis</HI> had let fall, and the &s;ight of her embracing him,
all this made him no longer doubt of his Wives Fal&s;hood: <HI>I am be|tray'd</HI>
Cry'd he, <HI>by her whom I loved dearer than my own
Life: Was there ever a more Unhappy Man in the World?</HI>
In ending the&s;e Words, he returned to his Wives Chamber. She im|mediately
threw her &s;elf at his Feet, and melting into Tears,
would have ju&s;tify'd her &s;elf, and made known to him her Innocency;
but the Spirit of Jealou&s;ie had &s;o fully po&s;&s;e&s;t him, that he vio|lently
repre&s;t her: He harkned only to the Tran&s;ports of his Rage
and De&s;pair, and turning away his Eyes, that he might not &s;ee &s;o
lovely an Object, he had the Barbarity to &s;trike his Dagger into the
Brea&s;t of the mo&s;t Beautiful and mo&s;t Vertuous Woman in the World.
She offered her &s;elf to be &s;laughtered as an innocent Sacrifice, and
her Soul i&s;&s;ued out in a &s;tream of Blood.</P>
<P>O God, <HI>cryed I,</HI> O Imprudent <HI>Don Lewis!</HI> Why did you
leave this Charming Lady to the Fury of an Amorous Husband,
tran&s;ported with Jealou&s;ie! You might have &s;natch'd her out of
his cruel Hands. Alas, Madam, <HI>replied this Gentleman,</HI> he
knew not what he did; for what he would have done at another
time to have prevented &s;uch a Misfortune.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the unfortunate Marchione&s;s had rendred her la&s;t
Breath,* her cruel Executioner &s;hut her Apartment, took all the
Money and Jewels he had, mounted on Hor&s;eback, and fled with
all the &s;peed he could. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> re&s;tle&s;s, and more Amorous
than ever, returned thither in the Evening, notwith&s;tanding what|ever
might befal him: He was &s;urpriz'd when he was told the
Marchione&s;s was &s;till a&s;leep, he immediately went into the Garden,
and entred into the Gallery, through the &s;ame Window which he
had found open, and from thence came into the Chamber: 'Twas
&s;o dark, that he was fain to walk warily; when he felt &s;ome|thing
which had like to have made him fall, he &s;tooped down and
found it was a dead Body; he uttered a great Shriek, and doubt|ing
not but it was that of his dear Mi&s;tre&s;s, he &s;unk down with
<PB N="32" REF="35">
Grief: Some of the Marchione&s;s's Women walking under the Win|dows
of her apartment, heard <HI>Don Lewis</HI>'s Crys; they ea&s;ily got up
through the &s;ame Window, and entred the Room. What a &s;ad Specta|cle,
what a lamentable &s;ight was this? I cannot find Words to de|note
to you the Horror of this Spectacle, <HI>Don Lewis</HI> was no &s;ooner
come to him&s;elf, by the force of Remedies, but his Grief, Rage and
De&s;pair, broke out with &s;uch Violence, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to
calm him; and I am per&s;waded he had not out-lived her who&s;e
lo&s;s he occa&s;ioned, if the de&s;ire of Vengeance had not re-animated
him.</P>
<P>He parted like one furious in &s;earch of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Barbaran;</HI>
He &s;ought him every-where without hearing any news of him, H$
ran over <HI>Italy,</HI> traver&s;t <HI>Germany,</HI> came into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and pa&s;t in|to
<HI>France.</HI> He was told that the Marque&s;s was at <HI>Valentia</HI> in
<HI>Spain;</HI> he came there, and met not with him. In fine, three Years
being pa&s;t, without finding the means of Sacrificing his Enemy to
his Mi&s;tre&s;s's Gho&s;t, Divine Grace, which is irre&s;i&s;tible, and par|ticularly
on great Souls toucht his &s;o efficaciou&s;ly, that he imme|diately
changed his De&s;ire of Revenge into &s;erious De&s;ires of
leaving the World, and minded only the fitting him&s;elf for another
Life.</P>
<P>Being fill'd with this Spirit he returned into <HI>Sardagnia.</HI> He
&s;old all his E&s;tate, which he di&s;tributed among &s;ome of his Friends,
who with great Merit were yet very poor; and by this means
became &s;o poor him&s;elf, that he reduced him&s;elf to the begging of
Alms.</P>
<P>He had heretofore &s;een in going to <HI>Madrid,</HI> a place very fit to make
an Hermitage, (it is towards <HI>Mount Dragon</HI>) this Mountain is
almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, and you cannot pa&s;s to it but through an Overture&punc;
which is in the mid&s;t of a great Rock; it is &s;topt up when the Snow
falls, and the Hermitage lies buried more than &s;ix Months under
it. <HI>Don Lewis</HI> made one be built here, where he was wont to pa&s;s
whole Years without &s;eeing any one. He made &s;uch Provi&s;ions as
were nece&s;&s;ary, having good Books, and thus remain'd in this di&s;ma$
Solitude&punc; but this Year his Friends forced him hither, by rea&s;on of a$
great Sickne&s;s, which had like to have co&s;t him his Life. It is fou$
Years &s;ince he has led this Holy Spiritual Life, and &s;o different from
that to which he was born, that it is with great trouble he &s;ees any o$
his Acquaintance.</P>
<P>As to the Marque&s;s <HI>de Barbaran,</HI> he has wholly left the I&s;le of
<HI>Sardagnia,</HI> where he has not the Liberty to return. I am inform'd
he is married again at <HI>Anvers,</HI> to a Widow of a <HI>Spaniard</HI> name$
<HI>Fonccea.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="36">
And it is he him&s;elf that has related to one of my Friends the
Particularities of his Crime; and he is &s;o furiou&s;ly tortured with the
remembrance of it, that he imagines he continually &s;ees his Wife dy|ing,
and reproaching him with his Fury and Jealou&s;ie. In a word,
he has contracted &s;uch a deep Melancholy, that his Death is thought
by every one to be near, or at the lea&s;t, the lo&s;s of his Sen|ces.</P>
<P>The Gentleman here was &s;ilent; and I not being able to for|bear
weeping at &s;o Tragical a Relation, <HI>Don Fernand de Toledo,</HI>
who had ob&s;erv'd it, and would not take notice of it, for fear of
interrupting the Relation, rally'd me about my Tenderne&s;s, tel|ling
me how well he was plea&s;ed to find me &s;o Compa&s;&s;ionate,
and that I &s;hould not be long before I met with Objects fit to
exerci&s;e it on. I did not &s;o much mind the returning an An|&s;wer
to him, as the Thanking this Gentleman, who was pleas'd
to entertain me with the Recital of &s;o extraordinary an Adven|ture:
I intreated him to make my Compliments to <HI>Don Lewis,</HI>
and to give him from me two Pi&s;tols, &s;eeing he lived on Alms.
<HI>Don Fernand,</HI> and each of the Cavaliers, gave as much: <HI>Here is,</HI>
&s;aid the Gentleman to us, <HI>wherewith to enrich the Poor of</HI> Victoria;
<HI>for</HI> Don Lewis <HI>appropriates not &s;uch great Charities as the&s;e to him|&s;elf.</HI>
We told him, he was the Ma&s;ter, and might di&s;po&s;e of
the Money as he plea&s;ed. But to return to my Adventures:</P>
<P>Although I had a Pa&s;port from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the be&s;t
&s;pecified, and mo&s;t general, as is po&s;&s;ible, yet I was oblig'd to
take a Billet from the Toll-Hou&s;e; for without this Precaution,
all my Cloaths had been confi&s;cated: <HI>To what purpo&s;e then is
my Pa&s;port?</HI> &s;aid I to them. <HI>To none at all,</HI> replied they.
The Surveyers and Officers of the Cu&s;toms would not &s;o much
as ca&s;t their Eyes on it; they told me, the King mu&s;t come
and a&s;&s;ure them, that this Order was from him. It is to no
purpo&s;e for any one to alledge his being a Stranger, and igno|rant
of the U&s;ages of the Country: For they drily an&s;wer, <HI>That
the Stranger's Ignorance makes the</HI> Spaniard'<HI>s Profit.</HI> The ill
weather has kept me here two Days, during which I &s;aw the
Governe&s;s, and the Play. The principal place of this Town
is adorn'd with a very fair Fountain &s;tanding in the mid&s;t: it
is incircled with the Town-Hou&s;e, the Pri&s;on, two Convents,
and &s;everal well built Hou&s;es: Here is a New Town and an Old
one; every body for&s;akes this latter to dwell in the other.
Here are very rich Merchants; their chief Trade is at St. <HI>Se|ba&s;tian</HI>
or <HI>Bilbo;</HI> they &s;end great &s;tore of Iron to <HI>Grenada, E&s;tre|madour,

that the great Streets are &s;et with fine Trees, which are water|ed
with Streams running by them. From <HI>Mount St. Adrian</HI>

mu&s;t end this long Letter; it is late, and I have &s;poke to you

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>MY Letters are &s;o long, that it is hard to believe when I
fini&s;h them, that I have any thing el&s;e more to tell you;
yet my dear Co&s;en, I never clo&s;e any, but there remains &s;till
&s;ufficient for another: When I were only to &s;peak to you of
my Friend&s;hip, this would be an inexhau&s;tible Subject; you
may make &s;ome Judgment of it from the Plea&s;ure I find in obey|ing
your Commands. You are de&s;irous to know all the Parti|culars
of my Voyage, I will therefore go on to relate them:</P>
<P>I &s;et out very late from <HI>Victoria,</HI> by rea&s;on of my &s;tay at the
Governe&s;s's, whom I before mention'd: and we went to lie at
<HI>Miranda;</HI> the Country is very plea&s;ant as far as <HI>Avigny;</HI> we
came afterwards by a difficult Way to the Banks of the River
<HI>&V;rola,</HI> who&s;e Noi&s;e is the greater, in that 'tis full of Rocks,
on which the Water da&s;hes, beats up, and falls down, and
forms &s;everal Ga&s;cades in &s;everal places: We continu'd to a&s;|cend
the high Mountains of the <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> where we ran a thou|&s;and
&s;everal Dangers: we &s;aw the ancient Ruines of an old
Ca&s;tle, where Gho&s;ts and Spirits have their Apartments, as well
as in that of <HI>Qu$$ara,</HI> it is near <HI>Garga&s;on;</HI> and being to &s;top
there to &s;hew my Pa&s;port, becau&s;e here certain Cu&s;toms are
paid to the King, I learnt from the Alcade of the Borough,
who drew near my Litter to talk with me, that it is the com|mon
Report of the Country, That there were formerly a King
and a Queen here, who had &s;o fine and beautiful a Woman to
their Daughter, that &s;he was rather taken for a Godde&s;s than
a Mortal Creature: &s;he was call'd <HI>Mira&punc;</HI> and it is from her
Name came the <HI>Mira</HI> of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which is to &s;ay, <HI>Look
you$</HI> for as &s;oon as ever &s;he appear'd, all the People attentively
beheld her and cryed out, <HI>Mira, Mira;</HI> and here's the Etymo|logy
of a Word drawn far enough. This Prince&s;s was never
<PB N="35" REF="38">
&s;een by any Body who became not de&s;perately in love with her;
but her Di&s;dainfulne&s;s and Indifference made all her Lovers
pine away: The famous Ba&s;ilisk never kill'd &s;o many People as
the Beautiful and Dreadful <HI>Mira;</HI> &s;he thus depopulated her Fa|ther's
Kingdom, and all the Countries thereabouts were full
of the decea&s;ed and dying Lovers. After they had in vain Ad|dre&s;t
them&s;elves to her, they la&s;tly applied them&s;elves to Hea|ven,
to demand Vengeance on her Cruelty: The Gods at length
grew Angry, and the Godde&s;&s;es were not much behind them
in the Exerci&s;e of this Pa&s;&s;ion: &s;o that to puni&s;h her, the
Scourges of Heaven fini&s;h'd the De&s;truction of her Father's
Kingdom: In this general Calamity he con&s;ulted the Oracle,
which told him, <HI>That all the&s;e Mi&s;eries would not have an end,
till</HI> Mira <HI>had expiated the Mi&s;chiefs which her Eyes had done:
and that &s;he mu&s;t be gone, that De&s;tiny would conduct her to the
place where &s;he was to lo&s;e her repo&s;e and liberty.</HI> The Prince&s;s
obey'd, believing it impo&s;&s;ible for her to be touch'd with
Tenderne&s;s: She carried only her Nur&s;e with her; &s;he was
clad like a &s;imple Shepherde&s;s, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be taken notice
of, whether at Sea or Land. She ran over a great Part of the
World, committing every Day two or three Dozen of Mur|thers;
for her Beauty was not dimini&s;ht by the Fatigue of her
Travels: She arriv'd at length near this old Ca&s;tle, which be|long'd
to a young Count call'd <HI>N$os,</HI> endowed with a thou&s;and
Perfections, but extream proud and Re&s;erv'd: he &s;pent his
time in the Woods; as &s;oon as ever he perceiv'd a Woman,
he fled from her, and of all things he &s;aw in the World, &s;he
was his greate&s;t Aver&s;ion. The beautiful <HI>Mira</HI> was re&s;ting
her &s;elf one day under the &s;hade of &s;ome Trees, when <HI>Nios</HI> pa&s;t
by, cloathed with a Lyon's Skin, a Bow at his Girdle, and a
Mace on his Shoulder, his Hair was all clotted together, and
his Face be&s;meared like a Chimney Sweeper's, (this Circum|&s;tance
is ob&s;ervable) yet the Prince&s;s thought him the mo&s;t
hand&s;ome Man in the World; &s;he ran after him as if &s;he had
been mad, and he ran from her as if he had been in the &s;ame
condition; &s;he lo&s;t the &s;ight of him; &s;he knew not where to
find him: &s;he is now in the greate&s;t Sorrow, weeping Day and
Night with her Nur&s;e. <HI>Nios</HI> return'd to the Cha&s;e; &s;he &s;aw
him again, and would have follow'd him: as &s;oon as he per|ceiv'd
her, he did as at fir&s;t, and <HI>Mira</HI> betook her &s;elf again to
her Lamentations; but her Pa&s;&s;ion giving her new &s;trength,
&s;he out-ran him, &s;topt him, taking hold of his Locks, intre$t|ing
him to look on her, thinking this was enough to engage
him: He ca&s;t his Eyes on her with as much Indifference a$
<PB N="36" REF="39">
if &s;he had been an ordinary Per&s;on. Never Woman was more
&s;urprized; &s;he would not leave him; &s;he came maugre him to
his Ca&s;tle: where, as &s;oon as &s;he had entred, he there left
her, and was no more &s;een. The poor <HI>Mira,</HI> being not to be
comforted, died with Grief, and from that time you hear
deep Sighs and Groans, which come from the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Nios.</HI>
The young Wenches of the Country are u&s;ed to go there, and
carry her little Pre&s;ents of Fruits and Milk, which they &s;et down
at the Mouth of a Cave, where no body dares enter: they &s;aid,
this was to comfort her; but this has been aboli&s;ht as &s;uper&s;titi|ons.
And though I believed not a word of whatever was told
me at <HI>Gargan&s;on,</HI> in Relation to <HI>Mira</HI> and <HI>Nios,</HI> yet I was pleas'd
in the Recital of this Story, of which I omit a thou&s;and Particu|lars,
for fear of tiring you by its length. My Waiting-Woman
was &s;o affected with this Relation, that &s;he was for having us re|turn
back again, to &s;et at the Mouth of the Cave &s;ome red Par|tridges,
which my People had bought: &s;he imagined the Prin|ce&s;s's
Gho&s;t would be mightily comforted in receiving this Te&s;ti|mony
of our good Will; but for my part, I thought I &s;hould be
more content than her, in having tho&s;e Partridges for my Sup|per.
We pa&s;t the River of <HI>&V;rola,</HI> on a great &s;tone Bridge, and
having went over another, with difficulty enough, by rea|&s;on
of the melted Snow, we arrived at <HI>Miranda d' Embro;</HI> this is
a great Village, or a little Town: here is a place adorned with a
Fountain; the River <HI>Ebro</HI> which is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
of <HI>Spain,</HI> traver&s;es it. You &s;ee on the Top of a Mountain the
Ca&s;tle, with &s;everal Towers; it appears to be of &s;ome &s;trength;
and there i&s;&s;ues out &s;o great a Stream from a Rock on which it is
built, that it turns &s;everal Mills, I could not ob&s;erve any thing
el&s;e worth writing to you.</P>
<P>The three Knights I &s;pake of to you, were arrived before
me, and given all requi&s;ite Orders for Supper; &s;o we eat to|gether;
And tho' the Night appeared well advanced, becau&s;e
the Days are &s;hort in this Sea&s;on, 'twas not late; &s;o that
the&s;e Gentlemen, who &s;hewed me great Re&s;pect and Civility,
askt me, How I would pa&s;s the time? I propo&s;ed to them the
playing at <HI>Ombre,</HI> and that I would go Halyes with <HI>Don Fernand
de Toledo.</HI> They accepted the Offer: <HI>Don Fernand de Cardonne</HI>
&s;aid, He had rather Conver&s;e with me than Play: &s;o the three
others began, and I for &s;ome time gave my &s;elf over to the
looking on them, with great Plea&s;ure, for their Way is quite
different from ours: They never utter a word; I do not &s;ay,
$o complain, (for this would be unworthy the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gravity)
<PB N="37" REF="40">
but to demand a <HI>Gano,</HI> or to cut higher, or to &s;hew that one
may take &s;ome other Advantage: In a word, they &s;eem to be
Statues of Pieces of <HI>German</HI> Clock-work, never appearing tran&s;|ported
with either good or bad Luck. Among other Di&s;cour&s;e
which I had with <HI>Don Frederick de Cardonne,</HI> he told me, There
were two ob&s;ervable things in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> one of which is a Moun|tain
of Salt, partly white as Snow, and the other part clearer and
more tran&s;parent than Chry&s;tal: that there is Blue, Green, Vio|let,
Orange, and a thou&s;and different Colours, which yet lo&s;es
its tincture when wetted, it continually forms it &s;elf, and grows
there: and though commonly the places where Salt is to be
found, are &s;o barren, that you &s;ee not &s;o much as an Herb, yet
there are here Pine-Trees of great height, and excellent Vine|yards:
When the Sun darts its Rays on this Mountain, it looks
as if it wholly con&s;i&s;ted of the mo&s;t precious Stones in the World:
but the be&s;t of it is, that it yields a good Revenue.</P>
<P><HI>The other particular he mentioned to me, was of a Foun|tain,
who&s;e Water is very good, and of the &s;ame Colour as
Claret,</HI> I have never heard any thing of this, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> but
one of my Relations, who has been in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> has a&s;&s;ured me
there is a Fountain near <HI>Balut,</HI> who&s;e Water is as others are for
Colour, and yet whatever you put therein, appears like Gold. I
have &s;een it, Madam, <HI>continued</HI> Don Fredric; and I remember
a Man that was tery covetous, and more fooli&s;h, went thither every
day to put therein his Silver, hoping in time 'twould be chang'd
into Gold: but he was &s;o far from enriching him&s;elf, that he was
ruin'd; for &s;ome Pea&s;ants more &s;ubtle and crafty than he, having
perceived what he did, &s;tood watching a little lower, and the
Stream of the Water would now and then brring &s;ome Pieces to
them. If you return into <HI>France</HI> by <HI>Catalonia, added he,</HI> you
will &s;ee this Fountain. It is not that which can draw me thither,
<HI>replyed I,</HI> but the de&s;ire of pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Montfe$at,</HI> would make
me undertake a longer Journey. It is &s;ituated, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> near
<HI>Barcelona,</HI> and is a place of great Devotion: It &s;eems as if the
Rock were &s;awed through the middle; the Church &s;tands high,
is &s;mall and ob&s;cure. By the help of Four&s;core and Ten Lamps of
Silver, you perceive the Image of the Virgin, which looks very
duski&s;h, and is held for Miraculous. The Altar co&s;t <HI>Philip</HI> the
Second thirty thou&s;and Crowns; and here is every day &s;een Pilgrims
from all Parts of the World, this Holy Place abounds with Her|mitages,
inhabited by Per&s;ons of great Devotion: The&s;e are com|monly
Men of good Birth, who have not left the World till they have
well tryed it, and who appear much taken with the Sweets of
<PB N="38" REF="41">
their Retirements, though the Place be di&s;mal; and 'twould been
impo&s;&s;ible to have had Acce&s;s to it, had not a Pa&s;&s;age been cut
through the Rocks. Yet you find here &s;everal agreeable Objects,
a curious Pro&s;pect, various Springs, Gardens well dre&s;t by the&s;e
Religio&s;es own hands, and every where a certain Air of Solitude
and Devotion, which mightly effect tho&s;e who come there. We
have another famous place of Devotion, <HI>added he,</HI> and that is
<HI>Nue&s;tra Senora del Pilar:</HI> it is at <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a,</HI> in a Chappel on a
Pillar of Marble, where our Lady holds the Babe Je&s;us in her
Arms. It is pretended, that the Virgin appeared on this &s;ame Pil|lar
to Sr. <HI>James;</HI> and the Image is here wor&s;hipt with great Reve|rence.
It cannot be well ob&s;erv'd, becau&s;e it &s;tands &s;o high, and
in a very dark place; &s;o that without the Flambeaux it could not
be &s;een at all. Here are always Fifty Lamps burning; Gold and
precious Stones &s;hine here on all &s;ides; and the Pilgrims came here
in great Sholes. But yet, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I may truly &s;ay, in favour of
<HI>S$rago&s;i$,</HI> that 'tis one of the fine&s;t Towns you &s;hall &s;ee; It is &s;itua|ted
along the <HI>Ebre</HI> in a va&s;t Field, is adorn'd with great Build|ings,
rich Churches, a &s;tately Bridge, fine open Palaces, and the
mo&s;t charming Women in the World, who love <HI>French,</HI> and will
omit nothing to oblige you to &s;peak well of them, if you pa&s;s by there.
<HI>I told him, I had already heard &s;everal things &s;poken of them
to their commendation:</HI> But <HI>continu'd I,</HI> this Country is very
Barren, and the Souldiers can hardly &s;ub&s;i&s;t in it. In effect, <HI>re|plied
he,</HI> whether the Air be bad, or that they want Nece&s;&s;aries
the <HI>Flemmings</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> cannot live there? and if they do not,

a Cour&s;e which the old Souldiers fail not to &s;teer; for the new|rais'd
ones, they peri&s;h in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> being not accu&s;tomed there|to;
and 'tis certain, there's no place where War is more trouble|&s;ome
to the King of <HI>Spain:</HI> He maintains his Forces here with
great Charge, and the Advantage which the Enemy gains of him
is not &s;mall; and I very well know they are more &s;en&s;ible at <HI>Ma|drid</HI>

and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Balbares,</HI> Plenipotentiary at
<HI>Nimiguen,</HI> has receiv'd Orders to pa&s;s &s;peedily to <HI>France,</HI> to de|mand
of that King, <HI>Mademoi&s;elle d' Orleans,</HI> therefore it is not
<PB N="39" REF="42">
doubted but the Marriage will be concluded: But it is thought ve|ry
&s;trange, <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> &s;hould con&s;ent to this Marriage. You
will do me a &s;ingular Plea&s;ure, <HI>&s;aid I, interrupting him,</HI> if you
would inform me of &s;ome Particularities touching this Prince: It is
natural for to have a Curio&s;ity in relation to Per&s;ons of his Cha|racter;
and when a body comes into a Court where one was never
before, that I may not appear a Novice, I &s;hould have &s;ome previous
Notices. <HI>He An&s;wered me, it would be a great &s;atisfaction to
him, if he could relate any thing might plea&s;e me, and he began
thus:</HI></P>
<P>You will not, perhaps Madam, think it ami&s;s, that I begin at the
Original of Things, and tell you, That this Prince was Son of one of
the fine&s;t Women in <HI>Spain,</HI> named <HI>Maria Calderona;</HI> &s;he was a
Player; and the Duke <HI>de Medina de las Torres,</HI> became de&s;perately
in love with her: This Cavalier had &s;o many Advantages above others,
that <HI>Calderona,</HI> lov'd him no le&s;s than &s;he was beloved by him.
In the Heat of this Intrigue, <HI>Philip</HI> the fourth &s;aw her, and pre|ferr'd
her to one of the Queen's Maids of Honour, and who was &s;o
grieved at this Change of the King, whom &s;he really loved, and had
a Son by, that &s;he retired from the World, and betook her &s;elf to
<HI>Los del Cal&s;as Reales,</HI> where &s;he put on the Religio's Habit. As
for <HI>Calderonne,</HI> her Inclination lying wholly towards the <HI>Duke de
Medina,</HI> &s;he would not hearken to the King, without the Duke
would thereto con&s;ent: She &s;pake to him of it, and offered to with|draw
&s;ecretly where he would; but the Duke fearing to incur the
King's Di&s;plea&s;ure, an&s;wer'd her, He was re&s;olv'd to yield up to his
Maje&s;ty a Trea&s;ure which he was not in a Capacity to contend for.
She made him a thou&s;and Reproaches for this, &s;he call'd him Traytor
to his Love, ingrateful towards his Mi&s;tre&s;s: And moreover, told
him, That though he was &s;o Happy, as that he could di&s;po&s;e of his
Heart as he plea&s;ed, yet &s;he could not do the &s;ame; and therefore he
mu&s;t continue to vi&s;it her, or prepare to &s;ee her die with De&s;pair&punc;
The Duke affected with &s;o great a Pa&s;&s;ion, promi&s;ed to feign a Journey
to <HI>Andalou&s;ia,</HI> and to remain with her hid in a Clo&s;et: he effectu|ally
parted from the Court, and afterwards &s;hut him&s;elf up (as it
was agreed) whatever Ri&s;que he ran by &s;o imprudent Conduct. The
King, in the mean time, was very Amorous, and remain'd very well
&s;atisfi'd: She had, during this, <HI>Don John$d' Au&s;tria,</HI> and the
Re&s;emblance he had with the Duke <HI>de Medina de las Torres,</HI> had
made it be thought that he was his Son; but tho' the King had other
Children, and particularly the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Malaga,</HI> good Fortune decided
in his Favour, and he has been only acknowledg'd.</P>
<P><HI>Don John</HI>'s Friends &s;ay, That 'twas by $word$ of the Exchange
<PB N="40" REF="43">
which had been made of the Son of <HI>Calderonna,</HI> for the Son of Queen
<HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and here's how they &s;et forth this Change, which is a
Story made on purpo&s;e to impo&s;e on the World, and which I believe has
no ground of Truth: They pretend, the King being de&s;perately in
love with this Player, &s;he became big with Child at the &s;ame time as
the Queen; and &s;eeing the King's Pa&s;&s;ion was &s;o greatly towards her,
that &s;he might expect any thing, &s;he &s;o ordered it, that &s;he made him
promi&s;e
her, That if the Queen had a Son, and &s;he likewi&s;e, he &s;hould
put hers in his place: <HI>What will you lo&s;e by this Sir?</HI> &s;aid &s;he,
<HI>Will it not be your Son that will &s;till Reign, only with this diffe|$ence,
that loving me, as you &s;ay you do, you will love him like|wi&s;e
the better.</HI> She had Wit, and the King could deny her nothing;
be con&s;ented, and in effect the Bu&s;ine&s;s was manag'd with that Ad|dre&s;s,
that the Queen being brought to Bed of a Son, and <HI>Calderonna</HI>
of another, the Exchange was made. He that &s;hould have Reign'd,
and who bore the Name of <HI>Baltazar,</HI> died at the Age of fourteen
Years: The King was told, 'twas with over heating him&s;elf at Ten|nis;
but the truth is, this Prince was &s;uffered to keep bad Company,
which procured him his Misfortunes; it is &s;aid likewi&s;e, That <HI>Don
Pedro de Arragon,</HI> his Governour, and chief Gentleman of his
Chamber, more contributed to this than any other, &s;uffering him
to b$$ng into his Apartment a Woman he loved; after this he was
taken with a violent Feaver, and concealed the Occa&s;ion: The Phy|&s;icians,
who were ignorant of it, thought to ea&s;e him by frequent
$leedings, which put an end to what &s;trength he had; and by this
means they ended his Life. The King knowing but too late, what
h$d $word$, bani&s;ht <HI>Don Pedro</HI> for not hindring this Exce&s;s, or for
not having timely d$&s;cover$d it.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Don John</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> who was brought up
as the Natural Son. changed not his Condition, though this ought to
$ave been, had be been indeed the lawful Son; yet notwith&s;tanding
this, his Creatures aff$$m, He &s;o exactly re&s;embles Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI>
$hat &s;he needs no other Picture of her likene&s;s. And this Opinion fails
not of gai$$ng $elief with the People, who run violently after Novel|ties&punc;
and who&s;e pa&s;&s;$$na$ely loved this great Queen, that they bewail
her $word$ as if &s;he was but now deceas'd. It is true, that if <HI>Don
John</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tri$</HI> would make his advantage of the favourable Di&s;po|&s;itions
of the People, he has met with &s;everal Opportunities of ex|tending
his Fortune very f$r; but his only Aim is to &s;erve the King,
and to keep his Subjects in th$&s;e Sentiments of Fidelity they ought to
have for him.</P>
<P>To return to <HI>C$lderonna:</HI> The King &s;urprized one day the Duke
<HI>de Medi$a</HI> with her, and in the exce&s;s of his Rage, be ran to
<PB N="41" REF="44">
$im with his Poynard in his Hand; he was about to kill him, when
this Woman placed her &s;elf between, telling him, He might &s;trike her
if he would. Having the mo&s;t extream Pa&s;&s;ion for her, he could not
but pardon him, contenting him&s;elf only with bani&s;hing him: But un|der&s;tanding
&s;he continued to love him, and write to him, he &s;t$diea on|ly
how to get a new Pa&s;&s;ion; when he had one &s;trong enough not to
apprehend the Charms of <HI>Calderonna,</HI> he &s;ent word to her to retire in|to
a Mona&s;tery, as is cu&s;tomary when the King for&s;akes his Mi&s;tre&s;s.
She put it not off, writing a Letter to the Duke to b$d him Adieu$
And &s;he receiv'd the Veil of a Religio from the Hand of the Apo&s;t$|lick
Nuncio, who became &s;ince <HI>Innocent X.</HI> It is very likely the
King believ'd <HI>Don John</HI> was his real Son, $$ing he loved him &s;o
dearly: One thing will appear to you very &s;i$$ular, which is, that
a King of <HI>Spain</HI> having natural Sons owned by him, they never en|tred
<HI>Madrid</HI> during his Life: So <HI>Don John</HI> was brought up at <HI>O|canna,</HI>
which is &s;ome Leagues di&s;tant from it. The King, his Father,
came oft thither, and he made him come even to the Gates of the
Town, where he went to meet him. This cu&s;tom comes from that
the Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> di&s;pute the Rank which the&s;e Princes would
hold. <HI>Don John,</HI> before he went into <HI>Catalonia,</HI> remained common|ly
at <HI>Buen Retiro,</HI> which is the Royal Seat at one of the farthe&s;t
parts of <HI>Madrid,</HI> a little without the Gate: And he &s;hew'd him|&s;elf
&s;o little, that he was never &s;een at any Publick Fea&s;t during the
Life of the late King: but &s;ince, times have changed, and his For|tunes
&s;tands on a different bottom.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Queen, <HI>Maria Ann</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> Si&s;ter to the Emperour,
and the King's Mother, Govern'd <HI>Spain,</HI> and her Son was not yes
of Age to hold the Reigns of the State. She would have always <HI>Don
John</HI> keep from the Court, and moreover, found her &s;elf &s;o capable
of Governing, that &s;he had a mind to ea&s;e her Son for a long time of
the Burden of Ruling. She was not troubled to &s;ee him ignorant of
whatever might give a de&s;ire of Reigning: but though &s;he brought
the greate&s;t Precautions, to hinder him from feeling he was under too
&s;trict a Tutelage, and &s;uffering no Per&s;ons to come near him, but tho&s;e
&s;he was well a&s;&s;ured of; yet this hindred not but &s;ome of the King's
Faithful Servants hazarded them&s;elves, by giving him to under&s;tand
what he might do for his Liberty. He followed the Advice was gi|ven
him, and in &s;ine, having taken Mea&s;ures accordingly, he &s;tole a|way
one Night, and went to <HI>Buen Retiro.</HI> He as &s;oon &s;ent from
thence an Order to the Queen his Mother, not to &s;tir out of the Pa|lace.</P>
<P><HI>Don John</HI> is of a middle Stature, well &s;haped, Black and
lively Eyes, and a mo&s;t Manly Countenance. He is Polite, Gene|rous,
<PB N="42" REF="45">
and very Brave. He is ignorant of nothing befitting his Birth,
being well ver&s;t in all Arts and Sciences. He writes and &s;peaks ve|ry
well five Languages, and under&s;tands yet more. He has for a
long time &s;tudied Judicial A&s;trology. There is no In&s;trument which he
cannot make, and u&s;e with the be&s;t Ma&s;ters. He works on all kinds
of Mechanicks, makes Arms, and paints finely. He took a great
Plea&s;ure in the Mathematicks; but being charg'd with the Govern|ment
of the State, he has been oblig'd to lay a&s;ide all other Em|ployments.</P>
<P>He came to <HI>Buen Betiro</HI> in the beginning of the Year 1677. and
as &s;oon as he was the$$ he &s;ent the Queen Mother to <HI>Toledo,</HI> be|cau&s;e
&s;he had declared again&s;t him, and hindred his return to the
King. <HI>Don John</HI> had an extream Joy in receiving from the King's
own Hand an Order to take Care of every thing, and to manage the
Affairs of the Kingdom: And 'twas not without occa&s;ion he di&s;charg'd
him&s;elf on him, &s;eeing he then was ignorant of the Art of Reigning.
It was alledg'd for a Rea&s;on of his &s;low Education, That the King
his Father was dying when he gave him Life: That when he came
into the World, they were fain to put him in a Box of Cotten, being
&s;o tender and &s;mall, that he could not be &s;wadled: That he was
brought up in the Arms, and on the Knees of the Ladies of the Palace,
till he was Ten Years old, without putting his Foot once all this
while on the Ground to walk: That in the Sequel the Queen his Mo|ther,
who was engaged by all the Ties of natural Duty to pre&s;erve
this only Heir of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Branch, fearing to lo&s;e him, dared not
let him &s;tudy, le&s;t by too great an Application he &s;hould lo&s;e his Health,
which in truth was very un&s;ound: And 'twas ob&s;erv'd, that the
great Number of Women, with whom the King always was, and who
too &s;harply reprehended him for his Faults which he committed, had
in&s;pired him with &s;uch a great Aver&s;ion to them, that as &s;oon as ever
he had notice a Lady &s;taid for him in any place he was to pa&s;s, he
&s;tole another way, or kept him&s;elf &s;hut up all day in his Chamber.
The Marchione&s;s <HI>de Los Veles,</HI> who was his Governe&s;s, told me,
&s;he waited for an Opportunity full &s;ix Months to &s;peak with him,
and when Chance had brought them unavoidably to him, he took
their Reque&s;ts from their Hands, but turn'd his H$ad another way,
for fear he &s;hould &s;ee them. His Health is &s;ince &s;o increa&s;ed, that
his Marriage with the Arch-Dutche&s;s, the Emperor's Daughter,
having been broke off by <HI>Don John,</HI> by rea&s;on 'twas the Queen-Mothers
Project, he has de&s;ired to marry <HI>Mademoi&s;elle d' Orleans.</HI>
The Circum&s;tances of the Pe$ce which are lately concluded at <HI>Ni|miguen,</HI>
made him ca&s;t his Eyes towards this? $ince&s;s, with who&s;e
excellent Qualities, Madam, you are better acquainted than I.
<PB N="43" REF="46">
It is hard to believe, that having Di&s;po&s;itions &s;o far from Gallantry,
he &s;hould become &s;o &s;uddenly and vehemently in love with the Queen,
as he became on the only Rehear&s;al of her good Qualities, and at
the &s;ight of her Picture in Minature, which was &s;hew'd him. He
never lets it go out of his Hand; he always holds it to his Heart;
He Dialogues with it &s;o prettily, as a&s;toni&s;hes all the Courtiers, for he
&s;peaks a Language he never &s;poke: His Pa&s;&s;ion for the Princes furni|&s;hes
him with a thou&s;and Thoughts, which he dares not entru&s;t any bo|dy
with. He thinks no body makes ha&s;t enough, and therefore &s;ends
fre&s;h Curriers everyday to carry his Billets <HI>doux,</HI> and brings back
News of her.</P>
<P>When you come to <HI>Madrid, added he,</HI> you will hear Madam, &s;e|veral
particulars which have without doubt hapned &s;ince I was there,
and which will perhaps more &s;atisfie your Curio&s;ity than what I have
related to you. <HI>I am very much oblig'd to you,</HI> an&s;wered I, <HI>for
your Civilities, but do me the Favour to oblige me farther, in
giving me the true Character of the</HI> Spaniards: <HI>You know
them, and I am per&s;waded nothing has e&s;cap'd your Enquiries;
You &s;peaking to me without Pa&s;&s;ion and Intere&s;t, I may reckon
my &s;elf &s;ure of what you tell me.</HI> Why believe you, Madam, <HI>re|plied
he &s;miling,</HI> that I &s;hall &s;peak to you more &s;incerely than another?
There are Rea&s;ons which may render me &s;u&s;pected: They are my Ma|&s;ters,
I mu&s;t manage them; And if I be not Politick enough to do it,
the Vexation of being con&s;trained to obey them, would tempt me to en|tertain
Notions in their Re&s;pect contrary to Truth. <HI>However it be,</HI>
&s;aid I, interrupting him, <HI>pray tell me what you know of them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards, &s;aid he,</HI> have always pa&s;t for Fierce and Glorious:
This Glory is mixt with Gravity; and they carry it &s;o far, that one
may call it an extravagant Pride; They are Brave, without being
Ra&s;h, yet they are accu&s;ed for not being daring enough; They are Cho|lerick,
Revengeful, without &s;hewing any Tran&s;port. Liberal with|out
O&s;tentation, Sober in their Diet, very Pre&s;umptuous in Pro&s;peri|ty,
too Rampant in Adver&s;ity: They Idolize Women, they are &s;o Pre|po&s;&s;e&s;t
in their Favour, that they &s;hew no Di&s;cretion in the Choice of
their Wives: They are patient to Exce&s;s, Ob&s;tinate, Idle, Singular,
Philo&s;ophi&s;ers: And as to the re&s;t, Men of Honour keeping their
Words, tho' it co&s;t them their Lives. They have a great deal of
Wit and Vivacity, ea&s;ily comprehend, explain them&s;elves in the &s;ame
manner, and in few words; They are Prudent, Jealous without mea|&s;ure,
di&s;intere&s;ted, bad Oeconomi&s;ts, Clo&s;e, Super&s;titious, great Ca|tholicks,
at lea&s;t in appearance: They are good Poets, and write
Ver&s;es with great Facility. They would be capable of Nobler Sciences
would they vouch&s;afe to apply them&s;elves thereto.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="47">
They have a Greatne&s;s of Soul, Elevated Wit, Con&s;tancy, a Na|tural
Seriou&s;ne&s;s, and a Re&s;pect for Ladies, as is not &s;een el&s;ewhere:
They have a Set Behaviour, full of Affectation, intoxicated with their
own Merit, hardly ever in this Particular doing Right to that of o|thers.
Their Bravery con&s;i&s;ts in &s;tanding Valiantly in the Defen&s;ive
Part, without giving Ground, and without dreading Danger, but
they love not to &s;eek it, which proceeds from their great Judgment:
They di&s;cern Danger, and avoid it. Their greate&s;t Defect, in my O|pinion,
is the Pa&s;&s;ion of Revenge and the Means they u&s;e for this:
Their Maxims hereupon are ab&s;olutely oppo&s;ite to Chri&s;tianity and
Honour: When they have receiv'd an Affront, they make him
be A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated who has offered it. They are not contented with this:
for they cau&s;e them to be A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated likewi&s;e whom they have offen|ded,
in the Apprehen&s;ion of being prevented, knowing well, that if
they do not kill, they &s;hall be killed them&s;elves. They pretend to ju|&s;tifie
them&s;elves herein, when they &s;ay, That their Enemy having took
the fir&s;t Advantage, they ought to; &s;ecure them&s;elves of the &s;econd:
That &s;hould they fail herein, they would wrong their Reputation:
That you mu&s;t not fight with a Man that has in&s;ulted over you, but
put your &s;elf in a Condition to puni&s;h him, without running half the
Dangers. It is true, that Impunity Authori&s;es this Conduct, for the
Priviledge of Churches and Convents in <HI>Spain,</HI> is to give an a&s;&s;ured
Retreat to Criminals; And as near as they can, they commit the&s;e
Villanies hard by a Sanctuary, &s;o have the le&s;s way to an Altar;
Which you &s;ee oft embraced by a Villain, with his Poynard reeking
in his Hand, and be&s;meared with the Blood of the Murther which he
has committed.</P>
<P>As to their Per&s;ons, they are very lean, little, fine &s;hape, come|ly
Head, good Faces, fine Eyes, well &s;et Teeth, yellow and duski&s;h
Complexion; they will have one walk &s;lowly, commend big Legs,
and a little Foot, Shooes without Heels, parting the Hair on both
&s;ides, being &s;trait cut, and kept behind their Ears with a great Two
handed Hat, an Habit always Black, in&s;tead of a Shirt, Taffity
Sleeves, or black Tabby, a Sword of a &s;trange length, with a
black Frieze Cloak over all this, very &s;trait Breeches, hanging
Sleeves, and a Poynard. All this mu&s;t &s;o disfigure a Man, let him
be otherwi&s;e never &s;o well &s;haped, that they &s;eem to affect a Garb the

&s;oon next Morning, becau&s;e 'twas a great Journey to <HI>Birbie&s;ca,</HI>
where we intended to lie. We followed the River to avoid the
Mountains, and pa&s;t at <HI>Oron,</HI> a great River, which falls into

with &s;everal Mountains, which &s;eem linkt together as
a Chain, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Oeca:</HI> We mu&s;t again pa&s;s o|ver
a little River, before we can come to <HI>Birbie&s;ca:</HI> This is on|ly

and &s;ome few plea&s;ant Gardens along the Water. But I may

one is &s;erv'd in the&s;e Inns, they being all alike: When you

of the Sun, or frozen by the Snows (for there is &s;eldom any
Temperament between the&s;e Two Extreams) you &s;ee neither
Pot on the Fire, nor Plates wa&s;h'd: You enter into the Stable,
and from thence to your Chamber; this Stable is ordinarily
full of Mules and Muletteers, who make u&s;e of their Mules
Saddles for Pillows in the Night, and in the day-time they
&s;erve them for Tables: They eat very friendly with their
Mules, and are very good Company together.</P>
<P>The Stair-Ca&s;e by which you go up is very &s;trait, and does
rather re&s;emble a &s;orry Ladder: <HI>La Sennora de la Ca&s;a,</HI> receives
you with her Gown tuckt up, and her dangling Sleeves; &s;he
takes time to put on her <HI>Sunday</HI>-Cloathes, whil&s;i you get out
of your Litter: and &s;he never omits this, for they are all very
Poor and Vain-Glorious. You are &s;hewed a Chamber who&s;e
Walls are white enough, hung with a thou&s;and little &s;curvy
Pictures of Saints; the Beds are without Curtains, the Co|vertures
of Cotton, the Sheets as large as Napkins, and the
Napkins like Pocket-handkerchiefs; and you mu&s;t be in &s;ome
con&s;iderable Town to find four or five of them; for in other
places there are none, no more than there are Forks! They
have only a Cup in the Hou&s;e; and if the Mule-Drivers get
<PB N="46" REF="49">
fir&s;t hold of it, which commonly happens, if they plea&s;e, (for
they are &s;erv'd with more Re&s;pect than tho&s;e whom they bring)
you mu&s;t &s;tay patiently till they have done with it, or drink out
of an Earthen Pitcher. It is impo&s;&s;ible to warm one at the
Kitchin-fire, without being choaked, for they have no Chim|neys,
and 'tis the &s;ame in all the Hou&s;es on the Road; there is
an Hole made in the top of the Ceiling, and the Smoak goes
out thence, the Fire is in the mid&s;t of the Kitchin: They put
what you would have roa&s;ted on Tiles, and when 'tis well gril'd
on one &s;ide, they turn the other: when 'tis gro&s;s Meat, they
fa&s;ten it to a String, and &s;o let it hang on the Fire, and turn it
with their Hands, &s;o that the Smoak makes it &s;o black, that it
would turn ones Stomack to look on it.</P>
<P>I think there cannot be a better Repre&s;entation of Hell than
the&s;e &s;ort of Kitchins, and the Per&s;ons in them, for not to &s;peak
of this horrible Smoak, which blinds and choaks one, there are a
Dozen of Men, and as many Women blacker than Devils, na&s;ty
and &s;tinking like Swine, and clad like Beggars. There are al|ways
&s;ome of 'em impudently grating on a &s;orry Guiter, and
&s;inging like a Cat a roa&s;ting. The Women have all of 'em their
Hair about their Ears, and you would take 'em for <HI>Bedlamites,</HI>
they have Gla&s;s Necklaces, which hang twi&s;ted about their Necks
like Ropes of Onions, but however &s;erve to cover the Na&s;tine&s;s
of their Skin. They are as great Thieves as any are in Jayl, and
they are urgent to &s;erve you only to have an opportunity to &s;teal
&s;omething of you, though it be but a Pin.</P>
<P>Before all things, the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e brings you her
little Children, who are bare-headed in the mid&s;t of Winter,
though but of a Day old: &s;he makes 'em touch your Cloaths, &s;he
rubs their Eyes with them, their Cheeks, Throat, and Hands.
This &s;eems as if one was become a Relick, and could heal all
Di&s;ea&s;es. The&s;e Ceremonies over, you are askt, If you will
eat any thing, and though at Mid-night, you mu&s;t &s;end to the
Butchery, the Market, the Tavern, the Bakers, in fine, to all
parts of the Town, togather wherewith to make a &s;orry Meal.
For though the Mutton here be very tender, their way of fry|ing
it with O$l, is not to every Bodies Reli&s;h. Here are great
&s;tore of Partridges, and tho&s;e very large; they are not very fat,
but dry, and to made them drier, they roa&s;t them to a Coal,
the Pidgeons here are excellent, and in &s;everal places here is
good Fi&s;h, e&s;pecially Be&s;&s;ugo&s;&s;es, which have the ta&s;te of a
Trout, and of which they make Pa&s;ties, which would be good,
were they not &s;tuff'd with Garlick, Saffron and Pepper. Their
Bread is white enough, and &s;weet, that one would think it
<PB N="47" REF="50">
made up with Sugar; but it is ill wrought and &s;o little baked,
that it is as heavy as Lead in the Stomach: it has the &s;hape of
a flat Cake, and is not much thicker than one's Finger. The
Wine is good, and Fruits in their &s;ea&s;on, e&s;pecially Grapes,
which are very large, and of delicate ta&s;te. You may reckon
your &s;elf certain of a good De&s;art. You have Sallads here of
&s;uch good Lettice as the World cannot afford better.</P>
<P>Do not think (Dear Co&s;en) 'tis &s;ufficient to &s;ay, Go fetch
&s;uch things, to have them; for not very &s;eldom you can meet
with nothing: But &s;uppo&s;ing you find what you would have,
you mu&s;t give out your Money before-hand: &s;o that your Meat
is paid for before you have begun to eat it; for the Ma&s;ter of
the Inn is only allowed to Lodge you: they alledge for a Rea|&s;on,
That it is not ju&s;t one only Per&s;on &s;hould go away with
all the Profit from Travellers, it being better the Money &s;hould
be di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>You enter not any Inn to Dine, but carry your Provi&s;ion
with you, and &s;top at the Bank of &s;ome River, where the
Mule-Drivers bate their Mules; and this is with Oats or Barley,
with chopt Straw, which they carry with them in great Sacks;
for as to Hay they give them none. It is not allow'd a Wo|man
to tarry above two Days in an Inn on the Road, unle&s;s &s;he
can offer good Rea&s;ons. And here's enough in relation to Inns,
and the Manner of your Treatment therein.</P>
<P>After Supper the&s;e Gentlemen play'd at <HI>Ombre,</HI> and I not
being &s;trong enough to play again&s;t them, I went &s;hares with
<HI>Don Frederick de Cardonne;</HI> and <HI>Don Fernand</HI> drew near the Fire|&s;ide
to me; he told me, He could have wi&s;h'd my time would
permit me to pa&s;s by <HI>Vailladolid;</HI> that it is the mo&s;t plea&s;ant
Town of <HI>Old Ca&s;tille,</HI> it having been for a great while the Man|&s;ion
of the Kings of <HI>Spain;</HI> and that they have a Palace there
fit for them. That as to him, he had Relations there would
be infinitely plea&s;ed to entertain me; and would &s;hew me the
<HI>Dominicans</HI> Church, which the Dukes of <HI>Lerma</HI> have founded;
that it was very Stately, and the Portal of &s;ingular Beauty, by
means of the Figures and Embo&s;&s;ed Work, which enrich it:
That in the Colledge of the &s;ame Convent the <HI>French</HI> &s;ee there,
with great &s;atisfaction, all the Walls full of <HI>Flower de Luces;</HI>
it being &s;aid, a Bi&s;hop who depended on the King of <HI>France,</HI>
had been at the Charge of Painting them. He added, They
would have carried me to the Religio&s;es of St. <HI>Claire,</HI> to &s;hew
me the Choire of their Church, the Tomb of a <HI>Ca&s;tillan</HI>
Knight, whence 'tis &s;aid, i&s;&s;ues out Accents and Groans every
time any of his Family are near their Deaths, I &s;miled at this,
<PB N="48" REF="51">
as being doubtful of the Truth of &s;uch kind of Relations: &startq;You
give not Credit to what I &s;ay, <HI>continued he,</HI> neither would I
engage for the Truth of it, though all the Country thereabouts
are &s;o fully per&s;waded of it, that you would be &s;u&s;pected for
an Heretick &s;hould you que&s;tion it. But it is certain there is a
Bell in <HI>Arragon,</HI> in a &s;mall Town call'd <HI>Villilla,</HI> on the <HI>Ebre,</HI>
which is about fifty Foot compa&s;s, and it happens &s;ometimes
to &s;ound of it &s;elf, it being not perceivable to be agitated
by any Wounds or Earthquakes: in a word, by no vi&s;ible
thing. It fir&s;t Tolls, and afterwards, by intervals, Rings
out, as well in the Day as the Night: When it is heard,
it is not doubted but it denounces &s;ome &s;ad Accident: which
is what hapned in 1601, on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 13th of <HI>June,</HI> till
<HI>Saturday</HI> the 15th of the &s;ame Month; it cea&s;ed then to Ring,
but it began again on <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti,</HI> when they were on the
point of making the Proce&s;&s;ion. It was heard likewi&s;e when
<HI>Alphon&s;us</HI> the Fifth, K. of <HI>Arragon,</HI> went into <HI>Italy</HI> to take
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples.</HI> It was heard at the
Death of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth. It denoted the Departure of
<HI>Don Seba&s;tian,</HI> King of <HI>Portugal</HI> for <HI>Africk.</HI> The Extremity
of King <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, and the Decea&s;e of his la&s;t Wife
Q. <HI>Ann.</HI> You would have me to believe you, <HI>Don Fernand,
&s;aid I</HI> perhaps, I &s;hall &s;eem too ob&s;tinate in &s;tanding out
all this while, but you will agree there are Matters one may
lawfully doubt of. Nay, Madam, <HI>replied he, with a plea&s;ant
Air,</HI> I tell you nothing but what I can have a thou&s;and Wit|ne&s;&s;es
to ju&s;tifie; but perhaps you will &s;ooner believe <HI>Don
E&s;teve de Carvajal</HI> in a thing as extraordinary in his Country.&endq;
He at the &s;ame time call'd to him, demanding of him, &startq;Whe|ther
'twere not true, that there is in the Convent of <HI>Cardo$a</HI>
a Clock which fails not to Ring every time a Religious is to
die; &s;o that the time is known to a Day? <HI>Don E&s;teve</HI> con|firm'd
what <HI>Don Fernand</HI> &s;aid: and though I remain'd not ab|&s;olutely
convinc'd,&endq; yet I made a &s;hew as if I was.</P>
<P>&startq;You pa&s;s &s;o quickly through <HI>Old Ca&s;tille, continued</HI> Don Fer|nand,
that you will not have time to &s;ee what's mo&s;t remar|kable:
The Picture of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin is talkt of far and
near, which was found miraculou&s;ly &s;tampt on a Rock; it be|longs
to the Religio's <HI>Augu&s;tines d' Avila,</HI> and &s;everal Per&s;ons
go there out of Devotion; but one has no le&s;s Curio&s;ity to
&s;ee certain Mines of Salt, which are near there, in a Village
call'd <HI>Mengraville;</HI> you de&s;cend above two hundred Steps un|der
Ground, and then enter into a va&s;t Cavern form'd by
Nature, who&s;e Top, or Roof, is upheld by one only Pillar of
<PB N="49" REF="52">
Chry&s;talin Salt, of a&s;toni&s;hing Largene&s;s and Colour. Near
this place, in the Town of <HI>Soria,</HI> you &s;ee a great Bridge with|out
a River, and a great River without a Bridge, the River
being forc'd out of its place by an Earthquake.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But if you go as far as <HI>Medina del Campo, added he,</HI> I am
&s;ure the Inhabitants will give you a welcome Entrance, only
becau&s;e you are of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, whom they much affect,
to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves hereby from their Sentiments of the
other <HI>Ca&s;tillians:</HI> Their Town is &s;o priviledg'd, that the K.
of <HI>Spain</HI> has not the Power to create any Officers, nor the
Pope to confer Benefices: This Right belongs to the Town&s;|men,
and they often fall together by the Ears, in chu&s;ing of
their Magi&s;trates and Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;One of the Rarities of this Country is the <HI>Aquaduct</HI> of <HI>Sego|via,</HI>
which is five Leagues in length, it has above two hun|dred
Arches of extraordinary heighth, tho' in &s;everal places
there are two &s;tanding one on another; and 'tis all built on
Free Stone, there having been no Mortar, or any Cement
to joyn them: This is lookt on as one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Works,
or at lea&s;t as worthy to be &s;o. The River which is at the end
of the Town &s;urrounds the Ca&s;tle, and &s;erves it for a ditch,
it is built on a Rock. Among &s;everal things remarkable, you
&s;ee the Effigies of the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> who have Reign'd for
&s;everal Years: And there is no Town but <HI>Segovia</HI> and <HI>Seville</HI>
where Money is Coyned, and the Pieces of Eight which are
made at the former Places are held to be the be&s;t; and this
is by means of the River which turns certain Mills that &s;tamp
the Money. Here are likewi&s;e mo&s;t curious Walks along a
Meadow planted with Elm Trees, who&s;e Leaves are &s;o thick
and large, that the greate&s;t Heats of the Sun cannot pierce
them. I want not Curio&s;ity, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> for all things
which de&s;erve it; but I at pre&s;ent want time to &s;ee them:
However, I &s;hould be very glad to arrive timely at <HI>Burgos,</HI>
to view the Town. Which is to &s;ay, Madam, <HI>replied Don Fer|nand,</HI>&endq;
we mu&s;t lo&s;e your Company, and let you retire.</P>
<P>He gave notice thereof to the other Gentlemen, who gave
over their Play, and we thus &s;eparated.</P>
<P>I ro&s;e this Morning before Day; and I end this Letter as
<HI>Burgos,</HI> where I now arrived: Thus, Dear Co&s;en, I &s;hall &s;end

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>WE could &s;en&s;ibly perceive in arriving at <HI>Burgos,</HI> that this
Town is colder than any of tho&s;e we pa&s;t; and 'tis like|wi&s;e
&s;aid, you have none of tho&s;e exce&s;&s;ive Heats which are
intollerable in other Parts of <HI>Spain:</HI> The Town &s;tands where
you de&s;cend the Mountain, and reaches to the Plain as far as
the River, which wa&s;hes the foot of the Wall: the Streets are
very &s;trait and even: the Ca&s;tle is not great, but very &s;trong,
and is &s;een on the top of the Mountain: A little lower is the
triumphant Arch of <HI>Fernando Gon&s;ales,</HI> which the Curious &s;o
much admire. This Town was the fir&s;t that was conquer'd from
the <HI>Mores;</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> have long re&s;ided here;
'tis the Capital of <HI>Old Ca&s;tille,</HI> it holds the fir&s;t Rank in the
two States of the two <HI>Ca&s;tilles,</HI> although <HI>Toledo</HI> di&s;putes it
with her: You &s;ee her fine Buildings; and <HI>Vela&s;co</HI>'s Palace is
very &s;tately. Here are in all the Broad Streets and &s;pacious
Places, Fountains, with Statues, &s;ome of which are good
Pieces; but the fine&s;t &s;ight is the Cathedral, which is &s;o large
that Ma&s;s is &s;aid in five &s;everal places of it, without any di|&s;turbance
to each other: the Architecture is &s;o exqui&s;itely
wrought, that it may pa&s;s among the <HI>Gothick</HI> Buildings for a
Ma&s;ter-Piece of Art: and this is &s;o much the more remarkable
in that they built very &s;orrily in <HI>Spain:</HI> in &s;ome places this is &s;o
through Poverty, and in others want of Stone and Lime: I am
told that even at <HI>Madrid</HI> you &s;ee Hou&s;es of Earth, and the
fine&s;t are made with Brick, cemented with the &s;ame, for want
of Lime. To pa&s;s from the Town to the Suburbs of <HI>Bega,</HI>
you go over three Stone Bridges: the Gate which an&s;wers that
of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> &s;tands high, with the Image of the Virgin
upon it: this Suburb contains the greate&s;t part of the Convents
and Ho&s;pitals: there is a great one founded by <HI>Philip</HI> the Se|cond
to receive the Pilgrims which go to St. <HI>James,</HI> and
which entertains them for a Day. The Abbey of <HI>Mille Flores,</HI>
who&s;e Buildin$ is very &s;tately, is not far di&s;tant. You &s;ee
here in this Suburb &s;everal Gardens which are watered with
Fountains and plea&s;ant Springs; the River &s;erves for a Chan|nel:
And you find in a great Park inclo&s;ed with Walls, plea|&s;ant
Walks at all times of the Year.</P>
<P>I would have &s;een the Crucifix in the <HI>Augu&s;tines</HI> Convent;
it is placed in a Chappel of the Cloy&s;ter, large and dark enough
&s;o that you could hardly di&s;cern it, were it not for the Lamps
<PB N="51" REF="54">
which are continually burning, they'r above an hundred; &s;ome
are of Gold, and others of Silver, of &s;o extraordinary a &s;ize,
that they cover all the Vault of this Chappel: there are &s;ixty
Silver Candle&s;ticks of a length, exceeding the talle&s;t Man,
and &s;o heavy that two Men cannot lift them: they &s;tand on the
ground on both &s;ides of the Altar; tho&s;e which are upon it are
of Ma&s;&s;y Gold: You &s;ee between them two Cro&s;&s;es of the &s;ame,
&s;et out with Precious Stones, and Crowns hanging over the
Altar, adorned with Pearls and Diamonds of great Lu&s;tre:
The Chappel is hung with Tapi&s;try, wrought with Gold? it is
&s;o laden with rich Gifts, that there's hardly room to put them
in, &s;o that part of them are kept in the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>The Holy Crucifix &s;tands on the Altar, near the natural big|ne&s;s,
it is covered with three Curtains one on another, all
embroidered with Pearls and Diamonds: When they open
them, which is not done without great Ceremony, and for
Per&s;ons of Quality. Several Bells are rung, every one falls on
his Knees: and it mu&s;t be granted, that this place and &s;ight
&s;trikes one with an Awful Regard: The Crucifix is of Carv'd
Work, and cannot be better made; its Carnation is very na|tural;
it is covered from the Brea&s;ts to the Feet with a fine
Linnen, in &s;everal Foulds or Pleats, which makes it look like
a loo&s;e Jerkin, which in my Opinion, is not over agreeable.</P>
<P>It is commonly held, that <HI>Nicodemus</HI> made it; but tho&s;e
who are for making every thing Miraculous, will have it brought
down from Heaven, they know not how nor when. I was
told, certain Monks of this Town had once &s;tole it, and con|vey'd
it away: but it took a convenient time to give them the
&s;lip, and was found the next Morning in the Chappel, in its
u&s;ual place: The&s;e hone&s;t People being enraged, that it &s;hould
&s;erve them &s;uch a Trick, mu&s;tered up their Forces, and violently
laid Hands on't the &s;econd time, but to as little purpo&s;e; for
'twould by no means &s;tay with them: However, it works Mira|cles,
and is one of the chief Objects of Devotion in <HI>Spain:</HI> The
Religious tell you, it &s;weats every <HI>Friday.</HI></P>
<P>I was going into my Inn, when we &s;aw the <HI>Sieur de Car|donnes
Valet de Cambre,</HI> running as fa&s;t as he could after us:
he was booted, and three Friers &s;cowring after him: I was o|ver
ra&s;h in my Judgment; for I could not but think he had
&s;tole &s;omething in this rich Chappel, and was taken in the
Fact; but his Ma&s;ter, who was with me, having demanded of
him, What put him on &s;uch full Speed; He an&s;wer'd, He went
into the Chappel of the Holy Crucifix with his Spurs'on, and
the Fryers had kept him in cu&s;tody, to get Money of him, but
<PB N="52" REF="55">
that he was gotten out of their Clutches, but they were now
upon the Hunt for him. They make it a Forfeit as well as o|thers,
for a Man to go with Spurs into the&s;e Holy Places.</P>
<P>The Town is not very great, it is adorned with a &s;pacious
Place; here are high Pillars which bear up very fine Lodgings.
The Bull-Fea&s;ts are kept here, for the People are much delight|ed
with this &s;ort of Diverti&s;ement. There is al&s;o a very well-built
Bridge, long and large: the River which pa&s;&s;es under it
bathes a Meadow, on the Bank of which you &s;ee Allies of
Trees, which form a mo&s;t delicious Walk. Trade was hereto|fore
con&s;iderable, but it is of late much dimini&s;ht. The be&s;t
<HI>Ca&s;tillian</HI> is here &s;poken, and the Men are naturally Souldi|ers,
&s;o that when the King has need of them, he finds here
great Numbers, and better Men than el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>After Supper our company &s;et to Play, as heretofore: <HI>Don
Sancho Sanniento</HI> was for yielding his place to any one, pretend|ing
'twas his Right to entertain me this Evening. I knew he
had lately return'd from <HI>Sicily;</HI> I askt him, whether he had
been one of tho&s;e who had help'd to Cha&s;tize tho&s;e Rebellious
People? [Alas, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Navas</HI>
was &s;ufficient to puni&s;h them beyond what their Crime de&s;erv'd:
I was at <HI>Naples,</HI> in the de&s;ign to pa&s;s into <HI>Flanders,</HI> where I
have Relations of the &s;ame Name. The Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Veles,</HI>
Vice-Roy of <HI>Naples,</HI> engaged me to leave my fir&s;t Project, and
embark my &s;elf with the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Navas,</HI> whom the
King &s;ent into <HI>Sicily:</HI> We &s;et Sail in two Ve&s;&s;els of <HI>Majorca,</HI>
and arriv'd at <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> the &s;ixth of <HI>January.</HI> Having &s;ent no
notice of his coming, and no body expecting it, he was not
receiv'd with the Honours paid commonly to the Vice-Roys:
But in truth, his Intentions were &s;o cruel again&s;t the&s;e poor Peo|ple,
that his Entrance &s;hould have been made in Tears.</P>
<P>Scarcely was he arriv'd, but he clapt up the two Sheriffs in
Pri&s;on, named <HI>Vicenzo Zuffo,</HI> and <HI>Don Diego:</HI> He put <HI>Spaniards</HI>
in their Places; he rigorou&s;ly aboli&s;ht the Colledge of Knights
of the Star, and began to execute the Orders which <HI>Gonzaga</HI>
had long receiv'd, and which he had eluded through Favour or
Weakne&s;s. He immediately publi&s;ht an Order, by which the
King chang'd all the Form of Government of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> depriv'd
the Town of its Revenues, forbad its bearing for the future
the Glorious Title of <HI>Exemplary,</HI> di&s;&s;olv'd the Senate, and put
into the place of &s;ix Sheriffs, &s;ix Officers, two of which &s;hould
be <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that the&s;e Officers &s;hould not for the future appear
in Publick with their Formalities, that they &s;hould no more
be preceded by Drums and Trumpets, ride no more together
<PB N="53" REF="56">
in a Coach with four Hor&s;es, as they were wont; that they
&s;hould &s;it henceforward on a plain Bench; &s;hould have no
more Incen&s;e offered them in the Churches; go cloath'd after
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fa&s;hion; &s;hould A&s;&s;emble on Publick Affairs in a
Chamber of the Vice-Roys Palace; and have no longer any
Juri&s;diction on the Champian Country.</P>
<P>Every one was &s;eized with &s;uch Con&s;ternation, as if he had
been Thunder-&s;truck; but their Sorrow was much increa&s;ed
on the fifth of the &s;ame Month, when the Camp-Ma&s;ter-Gene|ral
went to the Town-hou&s;e, and &s;eized all their Charters, and
Original Copies of their Priviledges, and made them be burnt
publickly by the Hands of the common Hang-man. The Prince
<HI>de Condro</HI> was afterwards apprehended, to the great grief of
his Family, but particularly the Prince&s;s <HI>Elenora,</HI> his Si&s;ter,
who&s;e Tears were not &s;hed alone: this Prince&s;s is not above
Eighteen; her Beauty and Wit are miraculous, which a&s;toni&s;h
tho&s;e about her. <HI>Don Sancho</HI>'s Eyes grew red at the remem|brance
of this Prince&s;s, and I plainly perceiv'd Pity had not all the
&s;hare in what he &s;aid; yet he continued on his Di&s;cour&s;e to me
of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina.</HI></P>
<P>The Vice-Roy, <HI>added he,</HI> publi&s;ht an Order, by which all
the Citizens were enjoyn'd, under penalty of ten Years Impri|&s;onment,
and five thou&s;and Crowns Fine, to bring their Arms
into his Palace. He at the &s;ame time caus'd the great Bell
in the Town-hou&s;e to be taken down, and beaten to pieces
in their &s;ight: He ordered all the Bells in the Cathedral to be
melted, to make a Statue of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> And the Prince
of <HI>Condro</HI>'s Children were taken into Cu&s;tody: But their Fear
increa&s;ed, when the Vice-Roy ordered <HI>D. V. Zuffo</HI>'s Head to
be cut off. This Example of Severity Alarum'd all the People;
and what appear'd mo&s;t terrible, was, That in the late Trou|bles,
&s;ome Families of <HI>Me&s;&s;inois</HI> having withdrawn them&s;elves
into &s;everal Parts, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche,</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;a|dor

own Country, a&s;&s;uring them all was Quiet, and that a General
Pardon was already publi&s;ht; and for their greater a&s;&s;urance,
gave them <HI>Pa&s;sports.</HI> The&s;e poor People (who had not taken
up Arms, and being not of the number of the Revolters, know|ing
their Innocency, could never have imagin'd they &s;hould
have been treated as Criminals) return'd to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina;</HI> where
they had &s;carcely landed, but the Joy they had of &s;eeing them|&s;elves
in their Native Country, and in the mid&s;t of their
Friends, was &s;adly di&s;turb'd, when they were &s;ei&s;ed on, and
the next Morning, without any Quarter, or regard to Sex, or

<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge, <HI>continued Don Sancho,</HI> that my Nature
is &s;o aver&s;e to the Rigors every day exercis'd on the&s;e poor
People, that I could not for all the World remain any longer
at <HI>Me&s;&s;ina.</HI> The Marque&s;s <HI>de las Navas</HI> was for &s;ending to <HI>Ma|drid,</HI>
to inform the King of what he had done. I intreated
him to charge me with this Commi&s;&s;ion; and in effect he
con&s;ented, and gave me his Letters, which I have delivered to
the King at <HI>Madrid;</HI> and at the &s;ame time my Interce&s;&s;ions
for the Prince <HI>de Condro:</HI> And I pre&s;ume my good Offices will
not be wholly u&s;ele&s;s to him. I am per&s;waded, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI>
this was the principal Motive of your Journey: I am no pry|ing
body, but methinks you are greatly concern'd for the In|tere&s;t
of this Family. It's true, Madam, <HI>continued he,</HI> the In|ju&s;tice
done this Unfortunate Prince does &s;en&s;ibly affect me:
Were he not Brother to the Prince&s;s <HI>Eleonora, &s;aid I to him,</HI>
perhaps you would not much lay it to heart. But no more of
this; I perceive this Remembrance afflicts you. Pray let
me rather hear from you what is mo&s;t remarkable in your
Country. Ah! Madam, <HI>cried he,</HI> you in&s;ult over me, for you
mu&s;t needs know, that <HI>Galicia</HI> is &s;o poor and mean a Country
that there's no place for bragging; not but that the Town of
St. <HI>James de Compe&s;tella</HI> is con&s;iderable enough: it is the Capi|tal
of the Province, and &s;carce one in <HI>Spain</HI> that's &s;uperiour to
it in Riches and Greatne&s;s; Its Archbi&s;hoprick is worth Seventy
Thou&s;and Crowns a Year, and the Chapter has as much, It
&s;tands in an agreeable Plain, &s;urrounded with little Hills of
moderate height: and it &s;eems as if Nature had placed them
there to defend the Town from tho&s;e deadly Bla&s;ts which ari&s;e
from other Mountains. Here is a Univer&s;ity, fine Palaces,
&s;tately Churches, publick Places, and an Ho&s;pital, one of the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable, and be&s;t &s;erv'd in <HI>Europe.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ts of
two Courts of Extraordinary greatne&s;s, with Fountains in the
mid&s;t, &s;everal Knights of St. <HI>James</HI> live in this Town, and
the Metropolis, which is dedicated to this Saint, keeps his Bo|dy:
It is extream &s;tately, and prodigiou&s;ly rich: It is pre|tended
you hear a kind of Clattering at his Tomb, as if Arms
were &s;truck one again&s;t another: and this Noi&s;e is only heard
<PB N="55" REF="58">
when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are to undergo any great Lo&s;s. His Figure
is repre&s;ented on the Altar, and the Pilgrims thrice ki&s;s it,
and put their Hats on his Head: for this is the chief part of
the Ceremony: they have al&s;o another very &s;ingular one: they
a&s;cend the Top of the Church, which is covered with great flat
Stones: In this place &s;tands a Cro&s;s of Iron, whereon the Pil|grims
ever fa&s;ten &s;ome Rag, or Scrap of what they wear: They
pa&s;s under this Cro&s;s by &s;o &s;trait a Pa&s;&s;age, that they are forced
to crawl on their Bellies through it: and tho&s;e who are not
&s;lender, are in danger of being bur&s;ten. And there have been
&s;ome &s;o ridiculous and &s;uper&s;titious, that having omitted to do
this they have expre&s;ly return'd back again three or four hun|dred
Leagues, for you &s;ee here Pilgrims of all Nations. Here
is a <HI>French</HI> Chappel, of which great Care is taken: It is &s;aid,
the Kings of <HI>France</HI> have been always great Benefactors to it.
The Church which is under ground is better than that above,
there are &s;tately Tombs, and Epitaphs of great Antiquity,
which exerci&s;e the Wits of Travellers. The Archiepi&s;copal
Palace is a va&s;t Pile, and its Antiquity adds to its Beauty, in|&s;tead
of dimini&s;hing it. A Man of my Acquaintance, a great
Searcher into Etymologies, a&s;&s;ured me the Town of <HI>Compo|&s;tella</HI>
was &s;o called, becau&s;e St. <HI>James</HI> was to &s;uffer Martyr|dom
in the place where he &s;hould &s;ee a Star appear at <HI>Compo|&s;tella.</HI>
It is true, <HI>continued he,</HI> that &s;ome People pretend it
to be thus: but the Peoples Credulity and &s;uper&s;tition car|ries
them further: for you are &s;hew'd at <HI>Padron</HI> near <HI>Compo&s;tella,</HI>
an hollow Stone, and it is pretended this was the little Boat
in which St. <HI>James</HI> arriv'd, after he had pa&s;t &s;o many Seas in
it, which being of Stone, mu&s;t have, without a &s;ignal Mira|cle,
&s;unk to the bottom. I &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> you believe
this to be mo&s;t true, <HI>He &s;miled, and continued his Di&s;cour&s;e:</HI>
I cannot but give you the de&s;cription of our <HI>Militia:</HI> They
are called together every Year in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> and all
the Young Men from the Age of Fifteen are oblig'd to march,
for &s;hould it happen that a Father, or any other Relation &s;hould
conceal his Son or Kin&s;man, and tho&s;e who are Officers &s;hould
come to know it, they would condemn him who has &s;o of|fended,
to perpetual Impri&s;onment. There have been &s;ome
Examples of this, but they are rare, for the Pea&s;ants are &s;o
infinitely pleas'd to &s;ee them&s;elves Arm'd, and treated as <HI>Ca|valieros
&amp; de Nobles Saldados del Rey,</HI> that they would not for
any Con&s;ideration be wanting to &s;hew them&s;elves on this oc|ca&s;ion.
You &s;hall &s;eldom &s;ee in an whole Regiment any Soul|dier
that has more Shirts than that on his Back, and the Stuff
<PB N="56" REF="59">
they wear &s;eems for its Coar&s;ene&s;s to be made of Pack-thread,
their Shooes are made of Cord; they wear no Stockings, yet eve|ry
Man has his Peacock, or Dunghil Cock's Feather $o his Cap,
which is tied up behind, with a Rag about his Neck in form of
a Ruff; their Sword oftentimes hangs by their &s;ide tied with
a bit of Cord, and ordinary without a Scabbard; the re&s;t of
their Arms is &s;eldom in better Order: and in this Equipage
they march gravely to <HI>Tuy,</HI> where is the General Rendezvous,
it being a Frontier place to <HI>Portugal.</HI> There are three which
lie thus, the above-mention'd, <HI>Cindud-Rodrigro,</HI> and <HI>Badajor,</HI>
but <HI>Tuy</HI> is the be&s;t guarded, becau&s;e it is over again&s;t <HI>Valantia,</HI>
a con&s;iderable Town belonging to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and
which has been carefully fortifi'd: The&s;e two Towns are &s;o
near, that their Cannon will reach each other; and if the <HI>Portu|gue&s;es</HI>
have omitted nothing to put <HI>Valantia</HI> out of danger of
being in&s;ulted over, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend <HI>Tuy</HI> is in as good a
Condition to defend it &s;elf; It &s;tands on a Hill, who&s;e lower
part is wa&s;h'd by the River <HI>Minhio;</HI> it has good Ramparts,
&s;trong Walls, and good &s;tore of Artillery. It is here, I &s;ay,
where the&s;e our Champions bid Defiance to the King's Ene|mies,
and in a &s;trutting Bravery, declare, they do not fear
them. Perhaps &s;omething of this may happen in time, for
here are form'd &s;ome Troops as in any other part of <HI>Spain.</HI>
However, this is a great lo&s;s to the Kingdom, the whole Youth
being thus taken up; for the Lands, for the mo&s;t part lye un|till'd,
and on the &s;ide of St. <HI>James de Compo&s;tella,</HI> you would
think you &s;aw a Wilderne&s;s; on that of the Ocean, the Coun|try
being better and more peopled, yields great Profit, and all
things nece&s;&s;ary and convenient, as Oranges, Lemmons and
Pomgranates, &s;everal &s;orts of Fruits, and excellent Fi&s;h, e&s;peci|ally
Pilchards, more delicate than tho&s;e which come from <HI>Roy|an</HI>
to <HI>Bourdeaux.</HI></P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t remarkable things, in my mind, in this
Kingdom, is the Town of <HI>Doin&s;e,</HI> one part of which always
enjoys the &s;weetne&s;s of the Spring, and the Fruits of Autumn,
by rea&s;on of &s;everal Springs of Boiling Water, which warm the
Air by their Exhalations; whil&s;t the other part of this &s;ame
Town &s;uffers the Rigors of the longe&s;t Winters, &s;tanding as
it does at the Foot of a very cold Mountain; &s;o that you find
in the &s;pace of one only Sea&s;on, all tho&s;e which compo&s;e the
cour&s;e of the Year.</P>
<P>You &s;ay nothing, <HI>replied I to him,</HI> of the marvellous Foun|tain
call'd <HI>Louzano.</HI> Who have told you of it Madam? <HI>$an|&s;wer'd
he.</HI> Per&s;ons that have &s;een it, <HI>added I.</HI> You have been
<PB N="57" REF="60">
then told, <HI>continued he,</HI> that on the top of the Mountain of <HI>Cer|bret,</HI>
you find this Fountain at the Source of the River <HI>Lours,</HI>
which has Flux and Reflux as the Sea, tho' it be at twenty
Leagues di&s;tance from it; that the greater the Heats are, the
more Water it ca&s;ts, that this Water is &s;ometimes cold as
Ice, and &s;ometimes as hot as if it boil'd, there being no
Natural Cau&s;e to be giv$n for it. You learn, me Particulars I
was ignorant of, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> and this is doing me a great
Plea&s;ure, for I want not for Curio&s;ity in relation to things un|common.
I wi&s;h, <HI>replied he,</HI> 'twas not &s;o late, I would give you
an account of &s;everal Rarities in <HI>Spain,</HI> and which perhaps you
would gladly learn. I leave you for to Night, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI>
but I hope before we come to <HI>Madrid,</HI> we &s;hall have an
opportunity of di&s;cour&s;ing of them. He very civilly made me
a Promi&s;e; and the Play being ended, we bad one another good
night.</P>
<P>When I would go to re&s;t, I was led into a Gallery full of
Beds, as you &s;ee in Ho&s;pitals: I &s;aid, this was ridiculous,
and that needing only four, what occa&s;ion was there for &s;hew|ing
me forty, and to put me into &s;uch an open place to &s;tarve
me? I was an&s;wer'd, This was the be&s;t place in the Hou&s;e,
and I mu&s;t take up with it. I caus'd my Bed to be made, when
&s;carce was I laid down, but &s;ome body knockt &s;oftly at my
Door; my Women opened it, and remained much &s;urpriz'd
to &s;ee the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s followed by a dozen of &s;orry
Creatures, and &s;o cloath'd that they were half naked. I drew
my Curtain at the Noi&s;e they made, and opened more mine
Eyes at the &s;ight of this Noble Company. The Mi&s;tre&s;s drew
near to me, and told me, The&s;e were hone&s;t Travellers, who
were coming into the Beds which remained Empty. <HI>How, lie
here?</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>I believe you have lo&s;t your Sen&s;es. I &s;hould have
lo&s;t them indeed,</HI> replied &s;he, <HI>&s;hould I let &s;o many Beds &s;tand
Empty. Either, Madam, you mu&s;t pay for them, or the&s;e
hone&s;t Gentlemen mu&s;t lye in them.</HI> I cannot expre&s;s my
Rage to you; I was in the mind to &s;end for <HI>Don Fernand</HI> and
my Knights, who would have &s;ooner made 'em pa&s;s through the
Windows than through the Doors: But I con&s;idered this could
not be done without &s;ome Di&s;turbance, and therefore I came to
Terms, and agreed to pay 20<HI>d.</HI> for each Bed: they are hardly
dearer at <HI>Fontainbleau</HI> when the Court is there. The&s;e Illu&s;trious
<HI>Dons,</HI> or, to &s;peak better, <HI>Tatterdemalions,</HI> who had the In&s;olence
to come into my Room, immediately withdrew, having made me
&s;everal profound Reverences.</P>
<P>The next Morning I thought to have bur&s;t with laughter,
<PB N="58" REF="61">
tho' it was at my Co&s;t, when I di&s;covered mine Ho&s;te&s;s's Trick
to ruin me: For you mu&s;t know in the fir&s;t place, that the&s;e
pretended Travellers were their Neighbours, and that they are
accu&s;tomed to this Stratagem, when they &s;ee Strangers: But
when I would have reckoned the Beds to pay for them, they
were rowled all of them into the mid&s;t of the Gallery; there
were divers wretched Throughs of Straw pull'd out, which were
hardly good enough to entertain Dogs, yet I mu&s;t pay for each
20 <HI>d.</HI> Four Pi&s;toles ended our Di&s;pute. I was not able to put
my &s;elf in a Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;uch &s;ingularity did I find in this Ma|nagement.
I would not recount this little Accident to you, did
it not &s;erve to give you &s;ome in&s;ight into the Humour of this
Nation.</P>
<P>We &s;et out from <HI>Burgos</HI> very late, the Weather was &s;o bad,
and there had fall'n in the Night &s;uch great quantity of Rain, that
I tarry'd there as long as I could, in expectation of its cea&s;ing.
In fine, I came to a Re&s;olution, and a&s;cended my Litter. I
had not gotten far from the Town, but I repented of my leaving
it, no Track cou'd be &s;een, e&s;pecially on a very high &s;teep
Mountain, over which we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s. One of our
Mule-drivers, who went before, &s;truck too far on the Edge of
this Mountain, &s;o that he fell with his Mule into a kind of Pre|cipice,
where he broke his Head, and put his Arm out of joynt,
this being the famous <HI>Philip de St. Seba&s;tian,</HI> the mo&s;t intelli|gent
of all his Profe&s;&s;ion, and who commonly carries Per&s;ons of
Quality to <HI>Madrid;</HI> he was therefore much bemoaned, and we
remain'd a great while before we could hale him out from the
&s;curvy place where he had fall'n. <HI>Don Fernand</HI> was &s;o compa&s;|&s;ionate
as to let him have his Litter. The Night came &s;peedi|ly
on us and we could have comforted our &s;elves, could we have
return'd to <HI>Burgos,</HI> but it was impo&s;&s;ible, the ways were no le&s;s
$over'd with Snow on that &s;ide, than all the re&s;t; &s;o that we
put in at <HI>Madrigale&s;co,</HI> which has not above a dozen Hou&s;es,
and I may &s;ay we were be&s;ieg'd without having any Enemies.
This Adventure gave us &s;ome di&s;turbance, tho' we had brought
Provi&s;ions with us for &s;everal Days. The be&s;t Hou&s;e of the
Town was half uncovered; and I was &s;carce lodged there,
when a Venerable Old Man askt for me on the part of a La|dy
who was ju&s;t arrived: He made me a Compliment, and told
me, $word$ inform'd this was the only place where there was
any tolerable Entertainment; and therefore entreated me to
&s;pare her &s;ome room. He added, She was a Per&s;on of Quality
of <HI>Andalou&s;ia,</HI> was lately a Widow, and that he had the Ho|nour
to belong to her.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62">
One of our Knights, named <HI>Don E&s;teve de Carjaval,</HI> who is
of the &s;ame Country, fail'd not to demand her Name of the Old
Gentleman: He told him, &s;he was the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Los Rios.</HI>
At this Name he turn'd towards me, and &s;pake to me of her as
of a Per&s;on who&s;e Merit and Fortune were very con&s;iderable;
I readily accepted of this good Company: She immediately
came in her Litter, out of which &s;he had not de&s;cended, having
found no Hou&s;e where &s;he could abide.</P>
<P>Her Dre&s;s &s;eem'd to me very &s;ingular, had &s;he not been &s;o
hand&s;ome as &s;he was, &s;he could never have appear'd in any &s;ort
tolerable: Her Gown and Petticoat was of black Serge, and
over them a kind of Linnen Surplice, which reacht down lower
than her Knees, the Sleeves were long, and &s;trait in the Arms,
which hung over her Hands: This Surplice was fa&s;tned to
her Gown, and being not pleated behind, it &s;eem'd like a Bib$
&s;he wore on her Head a piece of Mu&s;lin, which covered her
Face, and one would have taken it for a Religio&s;e's Hood;
this covered her Neck, and reach'd down very low: There
appear'd no Hair on her Head, they were all hid under this Mu|&s;lin:
She wore a great Mantle of Black Taffaty, which covered
her Heels, and over this Mantle &s;he had an Hat, who&s;e Brims
were very large, fa&s;tned under her Chin with &s;ilken Twi&s;t. I
was told they wear this but only when they travel.</P>
<P>This is the Habit of the Widows and <HI>Duenna's,</HI> a Dre&s;s which
is in&s;upportable to my &s;ight; and &s;hould one meet with a Wo|man
in the Night thus cloath'd, one might be &s;tartled without
Reproach; yet the Lady was very beautiful in this Un&s;eemly
Dre&s;s. They never leave it, unle&s;s they marry; and they are
oblig'd to bewail the Death of an Husband, whom they could
not endure when living.</P>
<P>I was inform'd they pa&s;s the fir&s;t Year of their Mourning in
a Chamber hung with Black, wherein there is not the lea&s;t glim|mering
of Day-light to be &s;een, they &s;it cro&s;s-legg'd on a little
<HI>Holland</HI> Quilt. When this Year is ended, they retire into a
Chamber hung with Gray: they mu&s;t have no Pictures, no$
Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, nor Cabinets, nor fine Tables, nor Plate, nei|ther
mu&s;t they have any Diamonds, or wear any Colours: How|ever
mode&s;t they are, they mu&s;t live &s;o retired, that it mu&s;t
&s;eem their Soul is already in the other world. This Con&s;traint
is the cau&s;e that &s;everal Ladies who are wealthy, and e&s;pecially
in rich Hou&s;hold Goods, marry again to have the &s;atisfaction
of making u&s;e of them.</P>
<P><HI>After the fir&s;t Compliments I inform'd my &s;elf from this
mournful Widow where &s;he was going; &s;he told me, She had
<PB N="60" REF="63">
not for a long time &s;een a Friend of her Mother's who was a
Religious at</HI> La&s;huelgas de Burgos, <HI>which is a famous Nunnery,
wherein there are an hundred and fifty Nuns, mo&s;t of them the
Daughters of Princes, Dukes, and Titulado's. She added, That
the Abbe&s;s is Lady of fourteen large Towns, and above fifty
other Places, wherein &s;he chu&s;es Governours and Magi&s;trates;
that &s;he is Superior of &s;eventeen Convents; Collates to &s;everal
Benefices, and di&s;po&s;es of twelve Commander&s;hips in favour of
whom &s;he plea&s;es. She told me &s;he de&s;ign'd to pa&s;s &s;ome time
in this Mona&s;tery:</HI> Can you, Madam, <HI>&s;aid</HI> I <HI>to her,</HI> accu&s;tom
your &s;elf to &s;o retired a Life as is that of a Convent? It will be no
hard matter, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> for I believe I &s;ee fewer People at my own
Hou&s;e than I &s;hall &s;ee there; and in effect the&s;e Religious have Li|berty
enough: They are commonly the hand&s;ome&s;t young Women of the
Family who are there; the&s;e enter therein &s;o young, that they know
not what they are made to leave, nor what they undertake at the
Age of &s;ix or &s;even, and it may be &s;ooner. They are cau&s;ed to make
Vows, when 'tis often the Father or Mother, or &s;ome near Relation,
who pronounce them for them, whil&s;t the little Sacrifice di&s;ports her
&s;elf with Sugar-plums, and lets them dre&s;s her how they will:
Yet the Bargain holds, there's no un&s;aying it; however, they have
every thing which can be expected in their Condition. There are at
<HI>Madrid</HI> &s;ome whom they call the Ladies of St. <HI>James:</HI> they are
properly Canonne&s;&s;es, who make their Tryals like the Knights of this
Order; they bear like them, a Sword made in form of a Cro&s;s,
embroidered with Crim&s;on Silk; they have them on their Scapularies
and great Cloaks, which are white: The&s;e Ladies Hou&s;e is very
&s;tately; all who come to vi&s;it them enter without any difficulty;
their Apartments are very fine, and every whit as well furni&s;h'd
as if they were at large in the World; they enjoy great Pen&s;ions, and
each of them has three or four Women to wait on them: It's true,
they never &s;tir out, nor &s;ee their neare&s;t Relations, but through &s;eve|ral
Grates. This perhaps would look horrid in another Country, but
in <HI>Spain</HI> they are accu&s;tom'd to Confinement.</P>
<P>There are Convents where the Religious &s;ee more Cavaliers than
the Women who live at large, neither are they le&s;s gallant; It is
impo&s;&s;ible for any to have more Gayety than they; and, as I have
already told you, Madam, here are more Beauties than abroad;
but it mu&s;t be granted, there are &s;everal among them who are
deeply &s;en&s;ible at their having been &s;o &s;oon &s;acrific'd; they think of
the Plea&s;ures which they have never ta&s;ted, as the only ones which
can make this Life Happy. They pa&s;s theirs in a Condition wor|thy
of Compa&s;&s;ion, always telling you, they are by Force;
<PB N="61" REF="64">
and that the Vows they are made to repeat at the Age of five or &s;ix
Years are to be regarded like Childrens Plays.</P>
<P>Madam, <HI>&s;aid I to her,</HI> it would have been great pity, had your
Relations de&s;igned you for &s;uch a Life; and one may judge in be|holding
you, that all the beautiful <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies are not Religio&s;es.
Alas, Madam, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, in fetching a deep Sigh,</HI> I know not
what I wou'd be; it &s;eems I am of a very odd Humour, not to be
contented with my Fortune: but one has &s;ometimes &V;nea&s;ine&s;&s;es
which are unaccountable to rea&s;on. <HI>In ending the&s;e words, &s;he
fa&s;tned her Eyes to the ground, and fell into &s;uch a deep fit of
Mu&s;ing, that I cou'd ea&s;ily perceive &s;omething di&s;turb'd her.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever Curio&s;ity I had to know the Subject, we had been
&s;o little together, that I dared not de&s;ire to be her Confident;
but to draw her from the melancholy Po&s;ture &s;he was in, I en|treated
her to tell me &s;ome News of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;eeing
&s;he came from <HI>Madrid.</HI> She did what &s;he could to recover
her &s;elf: &s;he then told me, There were great &s;hews of Joy at
Court on the Queen's Birth-day: that the King had &s;ent one
of the Gentlemen of his Chamber to <HI>Toledo,</HI> to Compliment
her from him: Yet the&s;e fine Appearances hindred not the
Marque&s;s <HI>de Man&s;era,</HI> the Queens <HI>Major Domo,</HI> from receiving
Orders to retire twenty Leagues from the Court, which had
greatly mortified this Prince&s;s. She inform'd us, That the Fleet
which carried Troops to <HI>Galicia,</HI> was unhappily ca&s;t away on
the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Portugal.</HI> That the little Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra
Nova,</HI> was to E&s;pou&s;e <HI>Don Nicoli Pignatella,</HI> Prince <HI>de Monte|leon,</HI>
her Uncle. That the Marque&s;s <HI>de Laganez</HI> had refu&s;ed the
Vice-royalty of <HI>Sardagnia,</HI> being in love with a fine Lady, whom
he could not find in his heart to leave. That <HI>Don Carlos de
Omodei,</HI> Marque&s;s <HI>de Almanazid,</HI> was dangerou&s;ly ill, at his
Di&s;appointment of being admitted a Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> to
which he pretended, having marry'd the Heire&s;s of the Hou&s;e
and Grandeur&s;hip of <HI>Ca&s;tle Rodrigue;</HI> and that which mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ibly
afflicted him, was, that <HI>Don Adriel de Gu&s;man,</HI> this Lady's
fir&s;t Husband, had enjoyed this Honour; &s;o th$$ he could not
but look on the Difficulties thrown in his way as a &s;lighting of
his Per&s;on: <HI>In truth Madam,</HI> &s;aid I to her, <HI>I can hardly com|prehend
how a Man of &s;ence, can with &s;uch eagerne&s;s pur&s;ue, and
be &s;o greatly dejected at a Di&s;appointment of this Nature. We
are otherwi&s;e affected in</HI> Spain, replied the beautiful Widow,
<HI>and this In&s;tance is a proof of it.</HI></P>
<P>Don Frederic de Cardonne, <HI>who greatly intere&s;ted him&s;elf for
the Duke</HI> de Medina Celi, <HI>askt her News of him:</HI> The King
<HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> has lately made him Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Indies.</HI> The
<PB N="62" REF="65">
Queen-Mother has wrote to the King, on the Report which runs,
that he is about Marrying; that &s;he is &s;urprized things are already
gone &s;o far, and he has not acquainted her with them. She adds
in her Letter, &s;he advi&s;ed him in the mean time, whil&s;t all things
were ready for this Ceremony, to make a Journey to <HI>Catalonia</HI>
and <HI>Arragon. Don John</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> &s;ufficiently under&s;tands the
Nece&s;&s;ity of this, and he pre&s;&s;es the King to depart, to content the&s;e
People, in promi&s;ing by Oath, according as is cu&s;tomary to new
Kings, to maintain all their ancient Priviledges. Have then
Madam, <HI>&s;aid I to her, interrupting her,</HI> the <HI>Arrogonois</HI> any
other Priviledges than the <HI>Ca&s;tilians?</HI> Very particular ones, <HI>re|plyed
&s;he,</HI> and you being a Stranger, I believe you will be wil|ling
to let me inform you of them. <HI>Here's what I learnt:</HI></P>
<P>The Daughter of Count <HI>Julien,</HI> named <HI>Cava,</HI> was one of the
mo&s;t beautiful Ladies in the World: King <HI>Rodrigue</HI> became
&s;o pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her, that his affections knowing
no Bounds, tran&s;ported him beyond all Mea&s;ure. The Father,
who was then in <HI>Affrica,</HI> informed of the Outrage done his
Daughter, who breathed nothing but Revenge, treated with
the <HI>Moors,</HI> and &s;upplied 'em with the means
to enter into <HI>Spain,</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="marg">This hap|pened in 714, after the Bat|tle of St. <HI>Mar|tin,</HI> wherein <HI>D. Rodrigue</HI> lo&s;t his Life; others &s;ay, he fled into <HI>Portugal,</HI> and Died in a Town there called <HI>Vi&s;cii.</HI></NOTE> and to make there, for
&s;undry Ages, all tho&s;e Ravages &s;et forth at large
in hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arragonois</HI> were the fir&s;t who &s;hook off the Yoak of
the&s;e Barbarians; and finding no more among them any
Princes of the Race of the <HI>Gothi&s;h</HI> Kings, they agreed to
Elect one, and ca&s;t their eyes on a Lord of the Country, call'd
<HI>Garci Ximinez;</HI> but they being Ma&s;ters, to impo&s;e Laws on
him, and finding him&s;elf &s;ufficiently Happy that he might Rule
over them under any Condition, the&s;e People therefore con|fin'd
him within narrow Bounds.</P>
<P>They agreed, That as &s;oon as their Monarch &s;hould break
through any of their Laws, he &s;hould immediately forfeit his
Power, and they be at full liberty to chu&s;e another, though he
were a Pagan: And to hinder him from violating their Privi|ledges,
and to defend them&s;elves again&s;t him, they e&s;tabli&s;ht
a Soveraign Magi&s;trate, whom they call'd the <HI>Ju&s;ticia,</HI> who&s;e
Office was to ob&s;erve the Conduct of the King, the Judges, and
the People: but the Power of a Soveraign being likely to Awe
a meer Particular, to A&s;&s;ure the <HI>Ju&s;ticia</HI> in the Execution of
his Office, they ordered, That he might not &s;uffer either in
<PB N="63" REF="66">
his Per&s;on or Goods, but by a compleat A&s;&s;embly of the States,
which they call <HI>Las Cortes.</HI></P>
<P>They moreover provided, That if the King &s;hould Oppre&s;s
any one of his Subjects, the great and con&s;iderable Men of the
Kingdom might a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves, and hinder his receiving
any of his Revenues, till the Innocent was acquitted, and re|e&s;tabli&s;ht in his former Rights. And to make <HI>Garci Ximinez</HI>
timely &s;en&s;ible of the Power this Man had over him, they &s;et
him on a kind of a Throne, and made the King to kneel down
bare headed before him, to receive from him his Oath of keep|ing
their Priviledges. This Ceremony ended, they acknow|ledge
him their Sovereign, but in as odd and di&s;re&s;pectful a
Manner, for in&s;tead of promi&s;ing him Fidelity and Obedience,
they &s;ay to him. <HI>We who are as good Men as your &s;elf, we make
you our King and Governour, on Condition you keep to us our Rights
and Properties, otherwi&s;e we Di&s;acknowledge you.</HI></P>
<P>The King, <HI>Don-Pedro,</HI> in proce&s;s of time coming to the
Crown reli&s;ht this Cu&s;tom, as unworthy of the Regal State;
and it &s;o greatly di&s;gu&s;ted him, that by his Authority and In|treaties,
and the Offers he made of be&s;towing &s;everal notable
Priviledges on the Kingdom, he procured the Aboli&s;hment of
this, in an A&s;&s;embly of the States: he got this general Con&s;ent
in Writing, which was repre&s;ented to him. As &s;oon as he had
the Parchment, he drew out his Dagger, and pierced his Hand
with it, &s;aying, <HI>'Twas fit a Law which gave Subjects the Liber|ty
of chu&s;ing their Sovereign &s;hould be Effaced with their Sove|reign's
Blood.</HI> His Statue is &s;till &s;een in the Deputation-Hall of
<HI>Sarago&s;&s;a:</HI> he holds a Dagger in one Hand, and the Charter in
the other. The &s;ate Kings have not been &s;uch Religious Ob&s;er|&s;ervers
of their Priviledges as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But there is a Law &s;till in force, and which is very &s;ingular,
and this they call, <HI>The Law of Manife&s;tation;</HI> which is, That
if an <HI>Arragono$s</HI> had Wrong done him in Judgment, in con|&s;igning
500 Crowns he may bring his Cau&s;e before the <HI>Ju&s;ticia,</HI>
who is obliged, after an exact Perqui&s;ition, to puni&s;h him who
has given a wrong Sentence: And if the fails therein, the op|pre&s;t
Per&s;on may have recour&s;e to the States of the Kingdom,
who A&s;&s;emble and Nominate five Per&s;ons of their Body, which
is to &s;ay, of the Prime Nobility, the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, the Gen|try
and Commonalty: they appoint three out of the fir&s;t Rank,
and two from each of the others. But it is ob&s;ervable, they
choo&s;e the mo&s;t Ignorant to Judge the mo&s;t able Men in the
Gown, whether to di&s;grace 'em the more for their Fault, or
as they alledge, <HI>That Ju&s;tice &s;hould be &s;o clear, that the very
<PB N="64" REF="67">
Plow-men, and tho&s;e who under&s;tand the lea&s;t, &s;hould di&s;cern it
without the help of Oratory.</HI> It likewi&s;e affirm'd, that the Judges
tremble when they pronounce a Sentence, fearing le&s;t it turn
again&s;t them&s;elves, to the lo&s;s of their lives or E&s;tates, &s;hould
they commit the le&s;t Fault therein, either wilfully, or through in|advertency.
It were well if this Cu&s;tom were ob&s;erved in all
Kingdoms: but this is rather to be wi&s;hed than expected.</P>
<P>Yet what is no le&s;s &s;ingular, is that Ju&s;tice remains always
Soveraign; and though the Unju&s;t Judge be puni&s;h'd &s;everely
for his wrong Decree, yet it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in its full force, and is fully
executed: If then any unhappy Wretch be &s;entenced to
Death, he is not &s;pared, tho' his Innocency be di&s;covered, and
made as clear as Noon-day, but his Judges are executed too
before his Face, which, in my mind, is a poor Con&s;olation.
If the Judge accu&s;ed, as ju&s;tly perform'd his Office, the Plain|tiff
leaves the 500 Crowns which he had con&s;ign'd. But were
he to lo&s;e an 100000 Crowns of Annual Revenue, by the Sen|tence,
he complains of, the Sentence or Decree remains good,
and the Judge is only condemned to pay him likewi&s;e 500
Crowns; the re&s;t of this Judge's E&s;tate is forfeited to the King:
which is in my Opinion, another Point of Inju&s;tice; for in
fine, he ought, above all others, to have Recompence made
him who &s;uffers by a wrong Sentence.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ame People have another Cu&s;tom, to di&s;tingui&s;h by
the Puni&s;hment the Crime committed: for Example, a Cava|lier,
who has kill'd another in Duel (for they are here &s;trictly
forbid) he has his Head cut off before; and he that has A&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nated,
his is cut off behind. This is to di&s;tingui&s;h him who
has behaved him&s;elf like a brave Man, from him that kills you
Treacherou&s;ly.</P>
<P>She added, That to &s;peak in general of the <HI>Arragonois,</HI> They
have a Natural Pride, which is hard to be &s;uppre&s;s'd: but like|wi&s;e
to do them Ju&s;tice, there are People of brave Minds to be
found among them; in&s;omuch that they are ea&s;ily di&s;cern'd
from all the re&s;t of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Subjects: That they
have never wanted Great Men, from their fir&s;t King to <HI>Ferdi|nand:</HI>
That they counted &s;uch a great number of them, as
would &s;carce be believ'd. However, they are greatly recom|mended
them&s;elves by their Valour and Conduct, that as to
the re&s;t, their Country was &s;o little fruitful, that excepting
&s;ome Valleys which were watered by Channels, who&s;e Water
came from the <HI>Ebre,</HI> the re&s;t was &s;o dry and &s;andy, that you
meet with &s;carce any thing el&s;e but &s;tony and parched up pla|ces:
That <HI>Sarrago&s;&s;a</HI> is a great City, the Hou&s;es &s;iner than at
<PB N="65" REF="68">
<HI>Madrid,</HI> the Publick Places adorn'd with Arches; That the
Holy Street, where the Cour&s;es are run, is &s;o long and large,
as may make it pa&s;s for a great and va&s;t place, having &s;everal
great Mens Palaces on it; that of <HI>Ca&s;telmorato</HI> being one of the
plea&s;ante&s;t: That the Vault of St. <HI>Francis</HI>'s <HI>Church</HI> was very
curious, for being of extraordinary Largene&s;s, yet 'tis upheld
by no Pillars: that the City is not &s;trong, but the Inhabitants
&s;o &s;tout, that it needed no Walls; that it has never a Foun|tain,
this being one of its greate&s;t Defects: That the <HI>Ebre</HI> car|ried
no Boats, the River being full of dangerous Rocks. As
to the re&s;t, the Archbi&s;hoprick was worth 60000 Crowns a
Year: That the Vice-Royalty brought in no Revenue, being a
Place of Honour, fit only for great Lords to bear the Expence
of it, to maintain their Ranks, and keep the People under,
who are Naturally Fierce and Imperious, not Affable to Stran|gers;
and &s;o little de&s;irous of making Acquaintance, that they
chu&s;e rather to &s;tay at Home alone all their Life-time, than
&s;tir out to procure Friend&s;hips: That here is a &s;evere Inqui&s;i|tion,
who have a &s;tately Palace, and a mo&s;t Rigid Court of
Ju&s;tice. Yet this does not hinder great Troops of Robbers, call'd
<HI>Bandoleros,</HI> from Ravaging, and di&s;per&s;ing them&s;elves over all
<HI>Spain;</HI> who give no Quarter to Travellers, &s;natching up &s;ome|times
Women of Quality, whom they afterwards &s;et at Ran|&s;om,
for their Parents to Redeem; but when they are Hand|&s;ome
they keep them: And this is the greate&s;t Misfortune can
happen to 'em, being forc'd to &s;pend their Days with the wor&s;t
of Men, who keep them in dreadful Caves, or carry them
along with them on Hor&s;e-back, being &s;o furiou&s;ly jealous of
'em, that one of their Captains having been lately &s;et upon
by Souldiers &s;ent into the Mountains to &s;eize on him, being
mortally wounded, and having his Mi&s;tre&s;s with him, who was
of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Camaraza</HI> a Grandee of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Family:
When &s;he &s;aw him in this Condition, &s;he thought only of ma|king
U&s;e of this favourable Opportunity of &s;aving her &s;elf;
which he perceiving, dying, as he was, he catch'd hold of her
Hair, and &s;truck his Dagger into her Brea&s;t, being not wil|ling,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that another &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a Trea&s;ure which had
been &s;o dear to him. And this is what him&s;elf acknowledg'd
to the Souldiers who found him, and &s;aw this &s;ad Spectacle.</P>
<P>The Beautiful Marchione&s;s here held her peace; and I re|turn'd
her all due Thanks for the favour &s;he did me, in inform|ing
me of the&s;e Curio&s;ities; and of which, perhaps without
her I might have been Ignorant all my Life. <HI>I do not think,
Madam,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to me, <HI>you owe me &s;uch Thanks; Irather fear
<PB N="66" REF="69">
the having de&s;erved Reproaches for &s;o long and tire &s;ome a Conver&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P>I would not let her leave me to eat el&s;ewhere; and I obliged
her to lye with me, &s;he having no Bed. So Civil and Cour|teous
a Proceeding made her much my Friend. She a&s;&s;ured
me of this in &s;uch Affectionate Terms, that I could not doubt
of it; for I mu&s;t tell you, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women are more
Care&s;&s;ing than we, and are far more Kind and Tender to tho&s;e
they profe&s;s Friend&s;hip. In fine, I could not forbear telling
her, <HI>That if &s;he had all the Kindne&s;s for me &s;he made Profe&s;&s;ion,
&s;he mu&s;t be &s;o complai&s;ant, to inform me what made her &s;eem &s;o
melancholly? That I had heard her fetch deep Sighs in the Night,
and appeared very Re&s;tle&s;s and di&s;con&s;olate; That if &s;he could
find any Comfort in &s;haring her Grief with me, I offered my Service
to her, as a mo&s;t faithful Friend.</HI> She embraced me with great
Affection, and told me without delay, &s;he would immediately
&s;atisfie my Curio&s;ity; which &s;he did in the&s;e Terms:</P>
<P>Seeing you are &s;o de&s;irous to know me, I mu&s;t without di&s;gui&s;ing to
you any thing, acknowledge my weakne&s;s to you: and by my Sincerity
and Open-heartedne&s;s, de&s;erve a Curio&s;ity as obliging as yours:</P>
<P>I come not of &s;uch a Family as may claim Nobility, my Father's
Name was <HI>Davila;</HI> he was only a Banker, but he was in good
Credit, and was moderately Wealthy: We are of <HI>Seville,</HI> Ca|pital
of <HI>Andalou&s;ia,</HI> and we have ever dwelt there. My Mother
knew the World, &s;he &s;aw many People of Quality, and having
no Children but me, &s;he took great care of my Education: It
did not appear ill be&s;towed on me; for I had the good For|tune
to get the good Will of mo&s;t that &s;aw me.</P>
<P>We had two Neighbours who came often to our Hou&s;e,
who were very welcome both to my Father and Mother:
Their Condition and Age were in no &s;ort alike: One was the
Marque&s;s <HI>de los Rios,</HI> a Per&s;on Wealthy and Noble; he was a
Widower, and well advanced in years: the other was the
Son of a great Merchant, who traded to the <HI>Indies;</HI> he was
Young and hand&s;ome, he had Wit, and very graceful Beha|viour,
his Name was <HI>Mendez;</HI> He was not long before he fell
pa&s;&s;ionately in Love with me; &s;o that he omitted nothing
which might plea&s;e me, and gain my affections.</P>
<P>He was in all places where he knew I was to pa&s;s; he &s;pent
whole Nights under my windows, to &s;ing Ver&s;es which he had
compo&s;ed and &s;et to my Prai&s;e, which he had very well accom|panied
with his Harp.</P>
<P>But &s;eeing his Attendancies had not all the effect he ex|pected,
and having pa&s;t &s;ome time in this manner, without
daring to mention his Affection to me, he at length re&s;olved to
<PB N="67" REF="70">
make u&s;e of the fir&s;t occa&s;ion to acquaint me with it. I avoid|ed
him ever &s;ince I had a Conver&s;ation with one of my Friends,
who had more Experience and Knowledge of the World than
I: I had felt, that <HI>Mendez</HI>'s Company gave me Joy, and that
my Heart had an Emotion for him, which it had not for others:
That when his Affairs, or our Vi&s;its hindred him from &s;eeing
me, I grew re&s;tle&s;s; and loving this young Woman, above
others, and being as dear to her, &s;he ob&s;erved I was not &s;o free
and gay as I was wont, and that my Eyes were &s;ometimes at|tentively
fixed on <HI>Mendez.</HI> One Day when &s;he rally'd with me
about it, I &s;aid to her very innocently, <HI>My dear</HI> Henrietta, <HI>de|fine
to me the Sentiments I have for</HI> Mendez: I <HI>knew not whe|ther
I ought to be afraid of them, and whether I ought not to de|fend
my &s;elf from them. I feel I know not what &s;ort of Trouble
and Plea&s;ure ari&s;ing in my Brea&s;t.</HI> She began to laugh, &s;he
embraced me, and &s;aid to me, <HI>my dear Heart you are in Love,
Who I in Love?</HI> replyed I, in amaze: <HI>You joke with me; I nei|ther
am, nor will be in Love. This depends not always on us</HI> con|tinued
&s;he, with a more Serious Air, <HI>our Stars decide this be|fore
our Hearts. But in earne&s;t, what is it &s;o much &s;$artles you:</HI>
Mendez <HI>is in a Condition equal to yours; he de&s;erves well, a good
comely Man; and if his Affairs go on with the &s;ame Succe&s;s as
they have done hitherto, you may live very happily with him. And
whence &s;hould I learn,</HI> applyed I, interrupting her, <HI>that he will
be happy with me, and that he &s;o much as thinks this. O take my
Word for it</HI> an&s;wered &s;he, <HI>whatever he has done has its De&s;igns;
for Men are not wont to pa&s;s Nights under Windows, and the Days
in following a Per&s;on for whom they have nothing but Indifferency.</HI></P>
<P>After &s;ome other Di&s;cour&s;e of this Nature, &s;he left me, and I
re&s;olved, maugre the Repugnance I felt in me, to give <HI>Mendez</HI>
no opportunity of &s;peaking to me in particular.</P>
<P><HI>But one Night as I was walking in the Garden, he came to|wards
me: I was perplext to &s;ee my &s;elf alone with him, and
he had the opportunity of ob&s;erving it on my Countenance,
and in the manner after which I received him. This could not
divert him from the de&s;ign he had of entertaining me:</HI> How
Happy am I, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to find you alone? But I do call my
&s;elf Happy! Perhaps I know not what I &s;ay: for it may be you will
not receive a Secret with which I would entru&s;t you. I am as yet &s;o
young, <HI>&s;aid I to him, blu&s;hing,</HI> that I would advi&s;e you to &s;ay nothing
to me, unle&s;s you would have me impart it to my Companions. Alas, <HI>con|tinued
he,</HI> &s;hould <HI>I</HI> tell you, I adore you; that all my Happine&s;s de|pends
on the Inclinations you have towards me: That I cannot live
without &s;ome certainty, that I may one day plea&s;e you; will you tell
<PB N="68" REF="71">
this to your Companions? <HI>No, &s;aid I to him in great perplexity,</HI> I would
look on this Confide$ce as a Railery, and not believing it my &s;elf, <HI>I</HI>
would not hazard its being left to be believ'd by others.</P>
<P>We were interrupted as I ended the&s;e words; and he ap|pear'd
to me not over-content with the An&s;wer I made him;
and a while after he found an opportunity to reproach me with it.</P>
<P>I could not but give a favourable Ear to the Inclinations I had
towards him; every thing he told me &s;eem'd to me to have its par|ticular
Gracefulne&s;s: And it was no hard matter for him to per|&s;wade
me, that he lov'd me above all things in the World. In
the mean time, the Marque&s;s <HI>de los Rios</HI> took &s;uch a liking to
me, and my Per&s;on and Behaviour ran &s;o deeply in his Thoughts,
that he wholly applied him&s;elf to plea&s;e me. He was very nice
and cautious; he could not re&s;olve with him&s;elf to owe me
wholly to my Parents Authority: He well knew they would
receive as an Honour the Intentions he had for me; but he was
for gaining my Con&s;ent before he demanded theirs.</P>
<P>In this De&s;ign he &s;aid all to me he thought was like to take
with me. I an&s;wered him, I &s;hould always think it an indi&s;|pen&s;able
Duty to obey my Father: yet our Ages were &s;o diffe|rent,
that I told him, I thought 'twere better he left off think|ing
of me; that I &s;hould have an everla&s;ting Acknowledgment
for the advantageous Intentions he had for me: and there|fore
I would e&s;teem him, tho' I could not love him. Ha|ving
heard what I had &s;aid, he was &s;ometime without &s;peaking,
and immediately taking up a very generous Re&s;olution: <HI>Lovely</HI>
Mariana, &s;ays he, <HI>you might have made me the happie&s;t Man in
the World, and if you were ambitious, I had therewith to &s;atisfie
you: But you refu&s;e me, and I de&s;ire to be anothers: I con&s;ent to
it; I love you too well to be in &s;u&s;pence, whether you are to be &s;atis|fied
or I; I therefore wholly &s;acrifice my Happine&s;s to you and leave
you for ever.</HI> In ending the&s;e Words he left me, and appear'd
&s;o afflicted, that I could not forbear being concern'd.</P>
<P><HI>Mendez</HI> arriv'd a while after, and found me melancholly:
He was &s;o earne&s;t with me to know the Cau&s;e, that I could not
deny him this Proof of my Compli&s;ance. Any one but he
would have had a &s;en&s;ible Obligation at the Exclu&s;ion I came
from giving his Rival: But far from &s;eeming to value it, he
told me, He &s;aw in mine Eyes the Regret I had for a Lover,
who could place me in another &s;ort of a Rank than he was able,
and that my Proceeding was very Cruel. In vain I endeavour|ed
to make him &s;en&s;ible of the Inju&s;tice of his; but all I could
&s;ay, could not hinder him from charging me with Incon&s;tancy.
I remain'd vext, and &s;urpriz'd at this his way of Dealing, and
was &s;everal days without &s;peaking to him.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="72">
He, in fine, at la&s;t under&s;tood he had no Rea&s;on to Com|plain;
he came to me, begg'd my Pardon, and te&s;tified to me
a great Di&s;plea&s;ure at his own Jealou&s;ie: He excu&s;ed him&s;elf,
as all Lovers do, on the &s;trength of his Pa&s;&s;ion. I had &s;o much
Weakne&s;s as to be willing to forget the Trouble he had given
me: we made up the Matter between us, and he continued on
his Court&s;hip.</P>
<P>His Father having under&s;tood the Pa&s;&s;ion he had for me,
thought he could not procure him a more advantageous Marriage:
he took notice of it to him, and came afterwards to my Father,
to open to him the Propo&s;al: they had been long Friends; he
was favourably heard, and they ea&s;ily agreed on the Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Mendez</HI> came to inform me of the News, with &s;uch Tran&s;ports
as would have &s;eem'd ridiculous to any other than a Mi&s;tre&s;s.
My Mother order'd me to look kindly on him, telling me this
Affair would be advantegous to me: and as &s;oon as the <HI>India</HI>-Fleet &s;hould arrive, wherein he was greatly concern'd, the
Marriage &s;hould be concluded.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t matters thus pa&s;t, the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios</HI> had re|tired
to one of his Country-Hou&s;es, where he &s;carcely &s;aw any
one: He led a langui&s;hing Life; he &s;till lov'd me, but hin|dred
him&s;elf from telling me &s;o, and from comforting him&s;elf
by this innocent Remedy.</P>
<P>In fine, his Body could not re&s;i&s;t the Heavine&s;s of his Mind;
he fell dangerou&s;ly ill, and being told by the Phy&s;icians, there
wa$ no hope of his Recovery, he pluckt up his Spirits to write
me the mo&s;t affectionate Letter imaginable, and &s;ent at the
&s;ame time to me a Deed of Gift of all his E&s;tate, in ca&s;e he dy|ed.
My Mother was in my Chamber, when a Gentleman pre&s;ent|ed
this Packet from him; &s;he would know what it contain'd.</P>
<P>I could not forbear at the &s;ame time, telling her what had
pa&s;t; and we were both of us in the greate&s;t &s;urprize at the
Marque&s;s's extream Genero&s;ity. She &s;ent him word, that I
&s;hould go with my Family to thank him for a Liberality which I
had no ways de&s;erved: And in particular, &s;he &s;harply repre|hended
me for having made a My&s;tery of a thing to her, with
which I ought to have immediately acquainted her. I threw my
&s;elf at her Feet, I excu&s;ed my &s;elf the be&s;t I could, and te&s;tified
&s;uch great Sorrow for having di&s;plea&s;ed her, that &s;he ea&s;ily par|doned
me. Leaving my Chamber, &s;he went to my Father, and
having learnt him all which had pa&s;t, they re&s;olved to go the next
morning to &s;ee the Marque&s;s, and to carry me with them.</P>
<P>I acquainted <HI>Mendez</HI> with this in the Evening; and the Fear
I had, le&s;t my Parents &s;hould, in fine, make me marry this
<PB N="70" REF="73">
old Man, if he chanced to e&s;cape out of his Sickne&s;s. Howe|ver
&s;en&s;ible I appeared to him of this, he was &s;o far tran&s;port|ed,
and reproacht me &s;o greatly with it, that I mu&s;t have lov'd
him as much as I did, not to have broke off with him: But he
had &s;uch an A&s;cendant over me, though he was the inju&s;te&s;t of
all Men, yet I thought him the mo&s;t Rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>We were at the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rio</HI>'s, his Country-hou&s;e was
not above two Leagues from <HI>Seville:</HI> Dying, as he was, he re|ceived
us with &s;uch Joy as was ea&s;ily ob&s;ervable. My Father te&s;ti|fi'd
to him his Grief, to &s;ee him in &s;o low a Condition, thankt him
for the Donation he made me, and a&s;&s;ured him, if he could find a
fair and ju&s;t Pretence, he would break off with <HI>Mendez,</HI> to whom
he had engaged his Word: That &s;hould this happen he promi&s;t
him &s;olemnly I &s;hould be no Body's but his. He received this
A&s;&s;urance in the &s;ame manner as if he had receiv'd a perfect
Felicity; but he knew well the Dolor I conceived thereat: I
became Pale, my Eyes were covered with Tears; and when
we were about leaving him, he de&s;ired me to draw near to
him; he told me with a langui&s;hing Tone: <HI>Fear nothing,</HI> Ma|riana,
<HI>I love you too well to di&s;plea&s;e you; you &s;hall have</HI> Men|dez,
<HI>&s;eeing your Affections are engaged to him.</HI> I an&s;wer'd him:
<HI>I had no particular Inclinations for him; but being commanded to
re&s;pect him, as a Man who was to be my Husband, I could do no o|therwi&s;e;
however, I intreated him to be well.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This &s;eem'd to me the lea&s;t &s;tep I could take towards a
Per&s;on to whom I had &s;o great Obligations. He appeared
thereat &s;ufficiently &s;atisfy'd, attempting to take my Hand and
ki&s;s it:</HI> Remember, <HI>&s;aid he to me,</HI> you enjoyn me to live; and
that my Life being your Work you will be obliged to con&s;erve it.
<HI>We return'd at Night, and the Impatient</HI> Mendez <HI>waited for
us, to make me new Reproaches: I took 'em as I was wont,
as Proofs of his Pa&s;&s;ion: and having ju&s;tified my &s;elf, I askt
him, What News there was of the Fleet,</HI> Alas! <HI>&s;aid he to me,</HI>
my Father has receiv'd &s;uch as drives me to Di&s;pair: I dare not
inform you. Have you any thing &s;eparate from me? <HI>&s;aid I to him,
looking tenderly on him:</HI> Would you have me to be re&s;erved to
you? I am too Happy, <HI>replied he,</HI> in that you have &s;uch favoura|ble
Di&s;po&s;ition; and being not able to keep any Secret from you,
I mu&s;t plainly tell you, that the Galion in which is our whole
E&s;tate, is &s;plit and lo&s;t, running again&s;t a Rock. But <HI>I</HI> &s;hould be
le&s;s &s;en&s;ible, how greatly &s;oever <HI>I</HI> am in Intere&s;t, did <HI>I</HI> not look on
the &V;nhappy Con&s;equences of this Lo&s;s: Your Pre&s;ence will re&s;tore
the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios</HI> to his Health; his Sentiments for you
are known in your Family; he is Rich, and a great Lord: <HI>I</HI>

become Mi&s;erable; and if you for&s;ake me, my dear <HI>Mariana, I</HI>
&s;hall have no more Hope but in &s;peedy Death. <HI>I was pierced
with Sorrow at this &s;ad News: I took one of his Hands, and
clo&s;ing it with mine, I &s;aid to him,</HI> My dear <HI>Mendez,</HI> do not
think me capable of loving you, and yet leaving you, by the Effects
of your good or bad Fortune: if you be able to bear up again&s;t it,
believe me &s;o too. <HI>I</HI> call Heaven to witne&s;s, <HI>continued I,</HI> provi|ded
you love me, and be faithful to me, that <HI>I</HI> will never for&s;ake
you; and let it puni&s;h me if ever <HI>I</HI> prove Incon&s;tant.</P>
<P>He te&s;tifi'd all the acknowledgements he ought me for &s;uch
affectionate A&s;&s;urances, and we re&s;olved not to divulge this
Accident.</P>
<P><HI>I withdrew very melancholly, and &s;hut my &s;elf up in my
Clo&s;et, ruminating on the Con&s;equences of this &s;ad Di&s;a&s;ter.
I was &s;till there, when I heard &s;ome Body knocking &s;oftly at
the Shutters of my Window: I drew near, and &s;aw</HI> Mendez <HI>by
the Light of the Moon:</HI> What do you here, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> at this
time of the Night: Alas, <HI>an&s;wer'd he to me, I</HI> was trying whe|ther
I could &s;peak with you before <HI>I</HI> departed: My Father has again
lately received News of the Galion, and will have me immediately
go where &s;he is run a ground, to endeavour to &s;ave &s;omething: It
is a great way thither, and <HI>I</HI> &s;hall be a great while without &s;eeing
you. Ah, dear <HI>Mariana,</HI> during all this time will you be as good
as your Word to me? May <HI>I</HI> hope my dear Mi&s;tre&s;s will be faithful
to me? Wha$ Rea&s;on have <HI>I</HI> given you, Mendez, <HI>&s;aid I, inter|rupting
him,</HI> to doubt it? Yes, <HI>continued I, I</HI> will love you
the mo&s;t &V;nfortunate Man in the World.</P>
<P>It would be to abu&s;e your Patience, Madam, to relate to you
what&s;oever we &s;aid in this doleful Separation, and though
there appear'd no Danger, yet our Hearts had a foreboding of
what was afterwards to happen to us. The Day began to ap|pear,
and we mu&s;t bid Adieu: I &s;aw him &s;hed Tears which were
accompanied with mine.</P>
<P>I threw my &s;elf on my Bed, rowling a thou&s;and &s;ad Thoughts
in my Mind: and I appear'd the next Morning &s;o out of Order,
that my Father and Mother were afraid I was falling into &s;ome
dangerous fit of Sickne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Mendez</HI> his Father came to make them a Vi&s;it, to excu&s;e his
Son's parting without taking his Leave of them. He added, <HI>He
had a Bu&s;ine&s;s which required &s;uch ha&s;t, as would not &s;uffer him a
Minute's time at his di&s;po&s;al.</HI> As to my &s;elf, Madam, I was
comfortle&s;s, being in&s;en&s;ible to every thing. And if any thing
could ea&s;e me, 'twas &s;ome hours Conver&s;ation with my dear
<HI>Henrietta,</HI> with whom I freely vented my Thoughts touching
the long Ab&s;ence of <HI>Mendez.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="75">
In the mean time the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios</HI> was out of Dan|ger,
and my Father went often to &s;ee him: I ob&s;erv'd one day
great Alteration on my Mothers Countenance, &s;he and my Fa|ther
having been long &s;hut up by the Religio&s;es, who came to
give 'em a Vi&s;it; and after a Conference of &s;ome time, they
called me, without my being able to divine the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I entred into their Apartment in &s;uch Di&s;order, that I knew
not what I did. One of the&s;e good Fathers, Venerable by his
Age and Habit, &s;pake much to me about the Re&s;ignation we owe
to the Divine Will, on his Providence, in every thing which
relates to us: and the Clo&s;e of his Di&s;cour&s;e was, That <HI>Mendez</HI>
was taken by the <HI>Algerines,</HI> that he was a Slave; and by his
Misfortunes the&s;e Pyrates had learnt he was a rich Merchants
Son, which had occa&s;ioned the &s;etting him at an extraordinary
Ran&s;om: That they were at <HI>Algiers</HI> in the time he arriv'd;
they would have willingly brought him along with 'em, but the
Money which they had for all, was not &s;ufficient for him alone.
That at their Return they had been at his Fathers to inform
him of this Vexatious Di&s;a&s;ter; but found he had ab&s;ented him|&s;elf,
that the lo&s;s of a Gallion, on which was embarkt all
his Effects, without being able to &s;ave any thing, had induced
him to avoid his Creditors, who &s;ought him every where, to
throw him in Pri&s;on. That things being in this Condition,
they &s;aw no Remedy to poor <HI>Mendez</HI> his Misfortunes, being in
the hands of <HI>Meluza</HI> the mo&s;t famous and covetous of all the
Cor&s;aries; and that if I would follow their Advice, and that
of my Parents, I would think of taking another Party. I had
&s;o far heard this Dreadful News in &s;o ec&s;tatic a Condition, that
I could only interrupt them by &s;ad Sighs; but when he told
me, I mu&s;t think of another Party; I bur&s;t out with Tears
and Shrieks, as made both my Father and Mother, and the&s;e
Religio&s;es compa&s;&s;ionate me.</P>
<P>I was carried into my Chamber as one nearer death than life;
and <HI>Donna Henrietta</HI> was &s;ent for, and it was not without great
Affliction &s;he beheld me in this &s;ad Condition. I fell into a
mo&s;t deep Melancholly, I tormented my &s;elf day and night, and
nothing was able to remove my dear <HI>Mendez</HI> out of my Mind.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios,</HI> having learnt what had pa&s;t,
conceiv'd &s;uch &s;trong Hopes, that he &s;oon found him&s;elf in a
Condition to come and Claim of my Father and me the Effect
of the Words we had given him. I &s;hewed him that mine
were not di&s;engaged in re&s;pect of <HI>Mendez;</HI> that he was Un|fortunate,
which no ways le&s;&s;en'd my Engagements to him.
He heard me without being per&s;waded by me, and told me,
<PB N="73" REF="76">
I had the &s;ame de&s;ire of de&s;troying my &s;elf as others had of
&s;aving them&s;elves; that 'twas more my intere&s;t than his, which
made him act as he did. And being ravi&s;ht with having a Pre|tence
which &s;eemed to him plau&s;ible, he pre&s;t my Father with
&s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s, that he at length con&s;ented to what he de&s;ired.</P>
<P><HI>It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to repre&s;ent to you, Madam, in
what an Aby&s;s of Sorrow I was in:</HI> What is become of my Lord,
<HI>&s;aid I to the Marque&s;s,</HI> of that Scrupulous Tenderne&s;s which hin|dered
you from taking my heart from any other hand than my
own? Let me at lea&s;t have &s;ome time to forget <HI>Mendez.</HI> Perhaps
his Ab&s;ence and Misfortunes may prevail on me to &s;ome Indifferency
towards him. To this cruel Accident, which has &s;natched him &s;o
lately from me, you add new Troubles when you expect I &s;hould &s;o
&s;peedily pa&s;s over from him to you.</P>
<P>I know not what I expect or may hope for, <HI>&s;aid he to me,</HI> but
this I am &s;ure of, that my Complai&s;ance had like to have co&s;t me my
Life, that if you be not de&s;igned for me, you will be anothers,
and as to <HI>Mendez,</HI> his Fortune has been &s;uch, that he can no longer
pretend to you, and &s;eeing you mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed of, I think you are
very hard hearted to refu&s;e me. You cannot be ignorant of what
I have done hitherto to plea&s;e you, my former Proceeding &s;hould
&s;erve as a &s;ufficient Te&s;timony of my future Re&s;pects.</P>
<P>The Marque&s;s made a greater progre&s;s in my Fathers Mind,
than mine. In a word, My Mother having one day &s;ent for
me, told me, 'Twas to no purpo&s;e to u&s;e any longer Delays,
my Father being re&s;olv'd I &s;hould obey his Orders. Whatever,
I could &s;ay to excu&s;e my &s;elf, my Tears, my Remon&s;trances,
Entreaties were all to no purpo&s;e, and &s;erv'd only to exa&s;pe|rate
my Mother.</P>
<P>All things nece&s;&s;ary were prepared for my Marriage, the
Marque&s;s would have every thing &s;uitable to his Quality. He
&s;ent me a Cabinet of Jewels and Precious Stones, to the value
of &s;everal thou&s;and Crowns. The fatal Day for our Wedding
was &s;et. Seeing my &s;elf reduced to this Extremity, I took a
re&s;olution which will &s;urprize you, Madam, and demon&s;trate
a great Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>I went to</HI> Donna Henrietta; <HI>this Friend had been ever faith|ful
to me, and threw my &s;elf at her feet, &s;urprizing her by &s;o
extraordinary a Carriage: My dear</HI> Henrietta, <HI>&s;aid I to her,
melting in Tears,</HI> there is no Remedy to my Misfortunes, unle&s;s
you have pity on me; do not abandon me, let me conjure you in the
&s;ad Condition I am in; to morrow I mu&s;t marry the Marque&s;s <HI>de
Los Rios,</HI> I can no longer avoid it. If the Offers of Friend&s;hip
you have made me $e Proof again&s;t all Tryal, and can make you
<PB N="74" REF="77">
capable of a generous Re&s;olution, you will not refu&s;e to follow my
Fortune, and to accompany me to <HI>Algiers</HI> to pay <HI>Mendez</HI> his Ran|&s;om,
to redeem him from the Cruel Slavery he is in. You &s;ee me
at your Feet, <HI>continued I,</HI> I will never ri&s;e till you have given me
your Word, to do what I de&s;ire you. <HI>She &s;eemed &s;o concern'd at
my Po&s;ture, that I aro&s;e to make her an&s;wer me. She imme|diately
embraced me with great Te&s;timonies of Tenderne&s;s: I</HI>
will refu&s;e you nothing, my dear <HI>Mariana, &s;aid &s;he to me,</HI> were
it my very Life; but you are going to ruin your &s;elf and me with
you. How can two Girls execute what you project? Our Age, our
Sex, and your Beauty, will expo&s;e us to Accidents, the bare ima|gination
of which makes me to tremble: this is certain, we are go|ing
to overwhelm our Families with Shame and Confu&s;ion; and if
you had made &s;erious Reflections hereon, it is not po&s;&s;ible you could
have come to this Re&s;olution. Ah, barbarous! <HI>cryed I,</HI> and more
barbarous than he that detains my Lover; you for&s;ake me, but
tho' I am alone, yet that &s;hall not hinder me from pur&s;uing my
Point, neither can the a&s;&s;i&s;tance you &s;hould give me &s;tand me in
much &s;tead: Remain, remain, I con&s;ent, it is fit I &s;hould depart
without any comfort to affront all Dangers; I confe&s;s &s;uch an un|dertaking
is fit only for a De&s;perate Creature.</P>
<P>My Reproaches and Tears moved <HI>Henrietta,</HI> &s;he told me my
Intere&s;t had obliged her as much as her own to &s;peak to me as
&s;he had done; but in &s;hort, &s;eeing I per&s;i&s;ted in my fir&s;t Re|&s;olution,
and nothing could divert me from it, &s;he was re&s;ol|ved
I &s;hould not go alone; That if I would be ruled by her,
we &s;hould di&s;gui&s;e our &s;elves; that &s;he would undertake to get
two Suits of Mens Apparel, and as for the re&s;t, it belong'd
to me to take care of it. I embraced her with a thou&s;and
Te&s;timonies of Thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>I afterwards askt her, Whether &s;he had &s;een the Jewels
which the Marque&s;s had &s;ent me: <HI>I will bring them,</HI> &s;aid I to her,
<HI>to purcha&s;e</HI> Mendez'<HI>s Ran&s;om with them.</HI> We re&s;olv'd to lo&s;e
no time, and we neither of us fail'd in what we had projected.</P>
<P>Never were two Maidens better di&s;gui&s;ed under the Habit
of two Cavaliers. We parted that Night, and embarkt our
&s;elves without the lea&s;t Ob&s;tacle, but after &s;ome days Sail we
were overtaken by &s;o violent a Storm, as made us de&s;pair of
our Safety. In all this Di&s;order and Peril, I was le&s;s concern|ed
for my &s;elf, than for not having compa&s;&s;ed my dear <HI>Mendez's</HI>
Liberty, and for having engaged <HI>Henrietta</HI> to follow my ill For|tune:
<HI>It is,</HI> &s;aid I to her, in embracing her, <HI>it is my dear
Companion, that has rais'd this Storm, were I not on the Sea it
would be Calm; my Misfortune follows me where-ever I go.</HI> In fine,
<PB N="75" REF="78">
we having been a Day and two Nights in continual Alarums,
the Weather chang'd, and we arriv'd at <HI>Algiers.</HI></P>
<P>I was &s;o glad to &s;ee my &s;elf in a Condition to deliver <HI>Mendez,</HI>
that I reckon'd all the Dangers we underwent as nothing:
But alas, what became of me in di&s;embarking, when after all
the &s;earch which could be made, I perceiv'd there was no
hope of finding the little Cabinet wherein I had put all I had
was mo&s;t precious: I found my &s;elf &s;eiz'd with &s;uch violent
Grief, that I thought I &s;hould have expired before I got out of
the Ve&s;&s;el. Without doubt this Cabinet, which was little, and
of which I took but &s;mall Care during the Tempe&s;t, fell into
the Sea, or was &s;tole, which ever of the&s;e two it was, I had
a con&s;iderable Lo&s;s, and I had only remaining Jewels to the
value of a thou&s;and Pounds, which I had kept for all Events
about me.</P>
<P>I re&s;olv'd with this, to make a tryal with <HI>Mendez</HI>'s Patron:
As &s;oon as we were in the Town, we enquired out his Hou&s;e,
(for <HI>Meluza</HI> was well known) and went thither clad as Gentlemen.</P>
<P>I cannot expre&s;s to you, Madam, the trouble I was in draw|ing
near this Hou&s;e, where I knew my dear Lover langui&s;ht in
Chains, what &s;ad Reflections did I not make, how did I look
when I enter'd the Cor&s;ary's Hou&s;e, and &s;aw <HI>Mendez</HI> Chain'd,
with &s;everal others, who were leading out to work in the Field.
I &s;hould have fallen at his Feet, had not <HI>Henrietta</HI> born me up,
I no longer knew where I was, nor what I did; I would have
&s;poken to him but Grief had &s;o &s;eiz'd on my Spirits, that my
Tongue could not utter a Word. As to him, he beheld me
not, he was &s;o &s;ad and depre&s;t, that he could look on on body,
and one mu&s;t love him as much as I did, to know him, &s;o great|ly
was he changed.</P>
<P>After having been &s;ome time coming to my &s;elf, I went into
a low Room, where I was told <HI>Meluza</HI> was, I &s;aluted him, and
told him the occa&s;ion of my Voyage, that <HI>Mendez</HI> was my near
Relation, that he was undone by the Lo&s;s of a Gallion, and his
Captivity together, and that 'twas out of my own Money that
I would pay his Ran&s;om. The <HI>Moor</HI> appeared to be a little con|cern'd.
It was not his bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire whence I had my
Money, but this he certainly knew, that <HI>Mendez</HI> was Rich,
and to &s;hew that he would not take all Advantages, he would
therefore &s;et him at twenty thou&s;and Crowns.</P>
<P>Alas, what would this have been, had I not lo&s;t my Jewels?
but this was too much in the Condition I was in. In fine, af|ter
&s;everal long fruitle&s;s Di&s;putes. I took on me immediately a
re&s;olution which could only be in&s;pired by an extream Love.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="79">
Here's all I have, <HI>&s;aid I to to the Pyrate, in giving him my
Diamonds,</HI> they are not worth what thou demande&s;t: take me for
thy Slave, and be per&s;waded thou wilt not keep me long. I am
the only Daughter of a Rich Banker of <HI>Seville;</HI> keep me for an
Ho&s;tage, and let <HI>Mendez</HI> go; he will &s;oon return to Redeem me.
<HI>The</HI> Barbarian <HI>was &s;urpriz'd to find me capable of &s;o generous
and affectionate a Re&s;olution.</HI> Thou art worthy, <HI>&s;aid he to me,</HI>
of a better Fortune. Be it &s;o; I accept the Condition you offer me:
I will take care of thee, and be a good Patron to thee. Thou mu&s;t
leave the Habit thou weare&s;t, to put on one agreeable to thy Sex:
thou &s;halt keep thy Jewels if thou wilt, I can as well &s;tay for the
whole as for a part.</P>
<P><HI>Donna Henrietta</HI> was &s;o confu&s;ed and di&s;mayed at the Bargain
I came from concluding, that &s;he could not &s;ufficiently expre&s;s
her Di&s;plea&s;ure to me; but in fine, maugre all her Remon|&s;trances
and Entreaties, I held firm, and <HI>Meluza</HI> caus'd a Slaves
Habit to be brought me, which I put on.</P>
<P>He conducted me to his Wives Chamber, to whom he de|livered
me, having recounted to her what I had done for my
Lover's Liberty.</P>
<P>She &s;eemed to be much effected with it, and promi&s;ed &s;he
would &s;horten the time of my Servitude by all the good Treat|ments
&s;he could make me.</P>
<P>At Night, when <HI>Mendez</HI> returned, <HI>Meluza</HI> cau&s;ed him to be
called, telling him, That being of <HI>Seville,</HI> he would there|fore
&s;hew him a Slave he had bought, becau&s;e perhaps he might
know her.</P>
<P>Immediately I was brought before him; <HI>Mendez</HI> at this &s;ight
lo&s;ing all Countenance, came and ca&s;t him&s;elf at my Feet, and
taking my Hands, which he bathed with his Tears, he &s;aid
every thing which was mo&s;t tender and affectionate to me.
<HI>Meluza</HI> and his Wife diverted them&s;elves, in &s;eeing the diffe|rent
Motions of Joy and Grief with which we were agitated;
in fine, they inform'd <HI>Mendez</HI> of the Obligations he had to me;
that he was free, and that I would remain in his place. He
did whatever could be done to di&s;&s;wade me from taking this
Task on me: <HI>Alas,</HI> &s;aid he to me, <HI>you would have me load you
with my Chains, my dear Mi&s;tre&s;s; Shall I be free, when you
are not? I go then to do for you what you come from doing for me;
I will &s;ell my &s;elf and Redeem you with this Money: for in fine,
con&s;ider that &s;hould I as &s;oon as I arrive at</HI> Seville, <HI>find A&s;&s;i&s;tance,
and return again to bring you back, yet how is it po&s;&s;ible for me in
the mean time to leave you; judge how I can do this in in a time
wherein my Fortune promi&s;es me nothing, and am the mo&s;t &V;nhap|py
<PB N="77" REF="80">
of all men.</HI> I offered again&s;t all the Rea&s;ons of Tenderne&s;s
of my Father, who would &s;oon Redeem me when he knew
where I was. In fine, I made u&s;e of all the Power I had over
his Mind, to make his Advantage of what I had done in his Fa|vour.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I &s;ay to you, Madam, of our Separation? It was
&s;o dolorous, that words cannot expre&s;s what we felt. I ob|liged
<HI>Henrietta</HI> to part with him, to &s;olicite and pre&s;s my
Parents to do their part in my behalf.</P>
<P>In the mean time my Father and Mother were in an uncon|ceivable
Affliction, and when they perceived my flight, they
thought to die with Grief.</P>
<P>They blamed them&s;elves infinitely for forcing me to marry
the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios.</HI> He was for his part no le&s;s in De&s;pair;
they cau&s;ed me to be &s;earcht for in vain, in all places where
they thought I might have hid my &s;elf.</P>
<P>Two whole Years were pa&s;t without my receiving any News
or Succours from <HI>Mendez;</HI> which made me believe with great
likelihood, that both he and <HI>Henrietta</HI> were ca&s;t away on the
Sea: I had given them all the Jewels which <HI>Meluza</HI> had left
me; but it was not their Lo&s;s, nor that of my Liberty, which
I regretted: It was of my dear Lover and faithful Friend,
who&s;e Remembrance continually po&s;&s;e&s;t me, and cau&s;ed me an
unparallel'd Affliction: I could get no Re&s;t nor Health; I wept
Day and Night, I refu&s;ed to come out of my Slavery in neg|lecting
to &s;ignifie to my Father my pre&s;ent Condition. I wi&s;ht
only for a &s;peedy Death; which I would have willingly met
with, to put an end to my Troubles and Misfortunes.</P>
<P><HI>Meluza</HI> and his Wife began to pity me, they did not doubt
but <HI>Mendez</HI> was ca&s;t away: they treated me le&s;s cruelly, than
the&s;e &s;ort of People are wont to u&s;e tho&s;e Unhappy Wretches
who fall into their Hands.</P>
<P>One day, as <HI>Meluza</HI> came from Pyrating, he brought with
him &s;everal Per&s;ons of both Sexes which he had taken, and
among the re&s;t a Young Woman of &s;ome Quality of <HI>Seville,</HI>
and whom I knew. This &s;ight renewed my Grief: &s;he was
much &s;urprized to find me in this &s;ad place. We affectionately
embraced one another, and ob&s;erving a deep &s;ilence; <HI>How now
Beautiful</HI> Mariana, &s;aid &s;he to me, <HI>are you &s;o indifferent towards
your Relations and Country, that you have no Curio&s;ity to make
any Enquiries about them?</HI> I lifted up mine Eyes to Heaven in
uttering a deep Sigh; I entreated her to tell me, If 'twere
known where <HI>Mendez</HI> and <HI>Henrietta</HI> were lo&s;t? <HI>Who has told
you they are lo&s;t?</HI> replied &s;he, <HI>they are at</HI> Seville, <HI>where they
<PB N="78" REF="81">
lead a very happy Life.</HI> Mendez <HI>has re-e&s;tabli&s;ht his affairs, and
makes it his great Delight and Honour to publi&s;h in all places the
Extream Obligations he has to</HI> Henrietta. <HI>Perhaps you are igno|rant,</HI>
continued &s;he, <HI>that</HI> Mendez <HI>was taken and made a Slave
by the</HI> Algerines; <HI>this generous young Woman di&s;gui&s;ed her &s;elf,
and came hither to redeem him, but he has not been ungrateful, for
he has married her. There is a mo&s;t charming &V;nion between them,</HI>
Hymen <HI>has not bani&s;ht Love in their Particular.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;he was yet &s;peaking, &s;he perceiv'd my Countenance to
after on a &s;udden, and that I was ready to faint: my Strength
fail'd me, mine Eyes clo&s;ed, and I &s;unk down between her
Arms, &s;he was greatly troubled at this; &s;he called my Com|panions,
who put me to Bed, and endeavoured to recover me
from this pitious Condition.</P>
<P>This young Woman greatly concerned her &s;elf for me, and
when I came to my &s;elf, I began to complain; I uttered Sighs
and Groans able to move a Rock.</P>
<P><HI>Meluza</HI> was affected at the Recital of &s;uch a wor&s;e than bar|barous
In&s;tance of Treachery, and without any notice to me,
he informed him&s;elf, by his new Slave of my Fathers Name,
and immediately wrote to him what he knew of my Misfortunes.</P>
<P>The&s;e Letters were like to have been the Death of my Mo|ther,
&s;he could not imagine I could be in Chains at eighteen
Years of Age, without &s;hedding a torrent of Tears: But that
which augmented her Grief, was, the Di&s;order of my Fathers
Affairs; &s;everal con&s;iderable Bankrupts had ruined him, his
Credit was gone, and it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to procure
the 20000 Crowns which <HI>Meluza</HI> demanded for my Ran&s;om.</P>
<P>The Generous Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios,</HI> heard this News, came
to my Father, and offered him what lay in his Power: <HI>I do not
do this,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>in de&s;ign to force your Daughters inclinations
when &s;he &s;hall be here; I &s;hall love her always, but I will never
di&s;plea&s;e her.</HI> My Father having no other way of Relief, thank|fully
accepted of what was offered him; and in a word, em|barkt
him&s;elf, and happily arrived at <HI>Algiers,</HI> in the time when
I thought only of dying.</P>
<P>He forbore all tho&s;e Reproaches I de&s;erv'd, he redeemed me,
and at my Intreaty, this young Woman of <HI>Sevelle,</HI> for a mo|derate
Ran&s;om. We return'd together, and my Mother re|ceived
me with &s;uch Joy as is impo&s;&s;ible to be expre&s;t. I an|&s;wered
hereto as much as was po&s;&s;ible; but I carried always in
my Heart, Madam, the fatal Stroke which had wounded me:
Whatever my Rea&s;on could repre&s;ent to me, was not &s;ufficient
to eface out of my Remembrance the Image of the Traitor
<HI>Mendez.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="82">
I &s;aw the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los Rios:</HI> he dared not mention the
inclinations he &s;till had towards me; but I had &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing
Obligations to him, that Gratitude made me do for him, what
my Inclinations would have made me do for another.</P>
<P>I gave him my Hand, and he his to me, with &s;uch Affection,
as if he had no &s;olid Matter of Complaint again&s;t me.</P>
<P>In fine, I married him, and apprehending le&s;t I &s;hould &s;ee
<HI>Mendez,</HI> that Ungrateful Wretch, to whom Lowe &s;uch Hor|rour,
and for whom I had &s;o little, I prayed the Marque&s;s we
might dwell in the Country-hou&s;e he had near <HI>Seville.</HI></P>
<P>He ever approved o$ what I liked: he would have my Father
and Mother retire, he le&s;&s;ened the &s;ad Condition of their
Fortune, by con&s;iderable Liberalities: and I may truly &s;ay,
there never was a greater Soul. Judge, Madam, of all the
Reproaches I made my Heart for its not being &s;o tender to him
as it ought to have been: it was not in my power to forget
<HI>Mendez,</HI> and I always felt new Regrets, when I learnt his Feli|city
with the unfaithful <HI>Henrietta.</HI></P>
<P>Having pa&s;t two Years in a continual watching over my
&s;elf, that I might do nothing but what was agreeable to my
Husband, Heaven deprived me of him, of this Generous Hus|band:
and he did for me in the&s;e la&s;t Moments, what he had
already heretofore done, giving me all he had, with &s;uch
Te&s;timonies of E&s;teem and Affection, as much enhanced the
Price of the Gift: He made me the riche&s;t Widow of <HI>Andalou|&s;ia,</HI>
but he could not make me the happie&s;t.</P>
<P>I would not return to <HI>Seville,</HI> where my Parents would have
had me been; and to avoid it, I pretended a Journey farther
into the Country, to look after &s;ome part of my E&s;tate. I &s;et
out; but there being a particular Fatality in whatever relates
to me, in arriving at an Inn, the fir&s;t Object which &s;truck
my &s;ight, was the Unfaithful <HI>Mendez:</HI> he was in deep
Mourning, and had not lo&s;t nothing of whatever made me here|tofore
fancy him too Lovely. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s
the Condition I was in, for endeavouring to get &s;peedily from
him, I found my &s;elf &s;o weak and trembling, that I fe$l at his Feet.
Although he knew me not at that in&s;tant, yet he earne&s;tly en|deavoured
to rai&s;e me up; but the great Veil under which I
was concealed, flying open, what became of him in &s;eeing me?
He remained no le&s;s confu&s;ed than I was: He would have drawn
near to me, but ca&s;ting a furious Look on him: <HI>Dare&s;t thou,
Perjured Wretch!</HI> &s;aid I to him, <HI>dare&s;t thou approach me!
Art thou not afraid of the ju&s;t Puni&s;hment of thy Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s?</HI>
He was &s;ome time without an&s;wering me, and I was about
<PB N="80" REF="83">
leaving him when he &s;topt me: <HI>Confound and over-whelm me
with Reproaches, Madam,</HI> &s;aid he to me: <HI>Give me the wor&s;t
and mo&s;t perfidious Names as is po&s;&s;ible; they cannot be more than
I de&s;erve: But my Death &s;hall &s;oon revenge your Quarrel: I
ought to die with Sorrow for having betray'd you; and if I regret
any thing in dying, it is only the having one Life to lo&s;e to expi|ate
all the Crimes you can ju&s;tly accu&s;e me of.</HI> He appeared to me
much affected in ending the&s;e words; and would to Heavens
his Repentance were really &s;ufficient and true? I would not
hazard a long Conver&s;ation with him: I le$t him, di&s;daining
to return him an An&s;wer. And this Mark of Contempt and
Slighting, was, without doubt, more &s;en&s;ible to him, than all
the reproaches I might have made him,</P>
<P>He had &s;ome time &s;ince lo&s;t his Wife, that Unfaithful Crea|ture,
who had helpt him to Revolt again&s;t all the Offices of
Love, Honour, and Gratitude. And from that time he fol|lowed
me every where: he was like a Complaining Shadow,
ever fa&s;tned to my Feet; for he became &s;o lean, pale, and
changed, that he was no longer di&s;cernable. Heavens! Ma|dam,
what Violence did I not offer my &s;elf, in continuing to
ill Treat him: I found at la&s;t I wanted Strength to re&s;i&s;t the
Weakne&s;s of my Heart, and the A&s;cendant this Wretch had o|ver
me. Rather than to commit &s;o &s;hameful an Offence, and
to Forgive him, I parted for <HI>Madrid,</HI> where I have Relations,
and &s;ought among them a She$ter again&s;t the Violence of mine
own inclinations.</P>
<P>I was not there long but <HI>Mendez</HI> found me out: I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s
to you, I was not heartily di&s;plea&s;ed at his Attendance on
me, but maugre my inclination towards him. I put on a firm
Re&s;olution to avoid him, &s;eeing I could not &s;incerely hate
him; and unknown to every Body, I took the Road to <HI>Burgos,</HI>
where I am going to Cloy&s;ter my &s;elf with a Religious there,
my Friend. I flatter my &s;elf, Madam, with the Hopes of
finding more Re&s;t there, than I have hitherto met with.</P>
<P>The Beautiful Marchione&s;s here held her peace; and I te&s;ti|fied
to her my particular Acknowledgments for the Favour &s;he
had done me: I a&s;&s;ured her of the part I took in her Adven|tures.
I conjured her to write to me, and to let me hear from
her at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and &s;he promi&s;ed it me in the mo&s;t obliging
manner as is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>We found the next Morning we could not &s;et out, it having
&s;nowed all the Night, and no Path appearing on the Ground;
but we wanted not Company to pa&s;s the time in Play and Di&s;|cour&s;e.
Having been three days with the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Los

Rios,</HI> without any Wearine&s;s at the length of the Time, through
the plea&s;ure I had of &s;eeing and hearing her talk (for &s;he is one
of the mo&s;t lovely Women in the World:) We parted with a
mutual Regret, and it was not without doubling our promi&s;es
of Writing to, and &s;eeing one another hereafter.</P>
<P>The Weather mended, and I continued on my Journey to
<HI>Lerma:</HI> We had traver&s;t dreadful Mountains, which bear the
Name of <HI>Sierra de Cogollos,</HI> and it was not without great trou|ble
we got thither: This Town is &s;mall, &s;he has given her
Name to the famous Cardinal <HI>de Lerma,</HI> Chief Mini&s;ter to
<HI>Philip</HI> III: it is from him that <HI>Philip</HI> IV. took the great Reve|nues
he had received from the King his Ma&s;ter. Here is a Ca&s;tle
which I will &s;ee to Morrow, and of which I &s;hall give you an
Account in my next. I am told an Extraordinary Expre&s;s is
arrived, and will &s;et out to Night: I will lay hold of this Op|portunity
of &s;ending to you, and ending this long Letter, for
in truth I am tired both with the Way, and with Writing, but
I &s;hall never be weary of Loving you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<P>MY La&s;t was &s;o long and I was &s;o weary when I
ended it, that I could not add &s;ome Particulars,
which probably might not have been unwelcome
to you; I proceed then (dear Kin&s;woman) to re|count
them, &s;eeing you &s;o much de&s;ired it.</P>
<P>I arrived late at <HI>Lerma,</HI> and re&s;olved to tarry &s;ome time to
&s;ee the Ca&s;tle which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;o highly e&s;teem, that they
prize it next the <HI>E&s;curial;</HI> and it is indeed a very fine place.
The Cardinal <HI>de Lerma, Philip</HI> the Third's Favourite, was its
Founder. It &s;tands on the &s;ide of an Hill, and in your way to
it you mu&s;t pa&s;s through a &s;pacious place, &s;urrounded with
Arches and Galleries about it. This Ca&s;tle con&s;i&s;ts of four va&s;t
Piles of building, which makes a compleat Quadrangle of two
Ranges of Porches within the Court, which are near as high as
<PB N="82" REF="85">
the Roof, and $inder the apartments from Pro&s;pects on that
&s;ide. The Windows of all the Chambers look forward into the
Country; the Rooms are &s;pacious, and the Lodgings very fine
and curiou&s;ly gilt. There are a Prodigious number of them,
and very well furni&s;ht. Near the Ca&s;tle you have a great Park
which extends it &s;elf along the Plain, through which runs a Ri|ver,
and &s;everal le$$er Springs: On the &s;ide of the River, there
are rows of great Trees, and not far hence a Wood, &s;o that
I believe, in fine weather this is a delightful place.</P>
<P>The keeper of the Ca&s;tle askt me, whether I would &s;ee the
Religio&s;es, who&s;e Convent is adjoyning thereunto. I told him
mo&s;t willingly; &s;o that he made us pa&s;s through a Gallery, at the
end of which you meet with a Grate which reaches from top to
bottom. The Abbe&s;s, having been adverti&s;ed of it, came here
with &s;everal Religio&s;es, who were very entertaining, hand&s;ome,
witty and young, di&s;cour&s;ing with great exactne&s;s of every
thing. I was not weary of their Conver&s;ation, when a young
Girl came and whi&s;pered the Abbe&s;s in the Ear, who afterwards
told me there was a Lady of great Quality, who had retired in|to
their Hou&s;e, being the Daughter of Don <HI>Mandrica de Lara,</HI>
Count <HI>de Valine,</HI> and elde&s;t Son to the Duke <HI>de Naxara;</HI> That
&s;he was Widow of Don <HI>Franci&s;co Fernandez de Ca&s;tro,</HI> Count <HI>de
Lemos</HI> Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Duke <HI>de Taure&s;ano;</HI> that when
&s;he knew of <HI>French</HI> Ladies pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Lerma,</HI> &s;he was great|ly
de&s;irous of entertaining them. I made an&s;wer, I &s;hould be
glad of the honour of &s;eeing her: Whereupon this young Girl
was &s;ent to her.</P>
<P>This Lady &s;oon came in a Dre&s;s u&s;ed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> this
hundred years; &s;he had a kind of Pattins on, or rather Stilts,
which made her look prodigious Tall, &s;o that &s;he was fain to
lean on two Per&s;ons Shoulders when &s;he moved. She leaned
likewi&s;e on two Daughters of the Marque&s;s <HI>del Carpio,</HI> one of
them is of a very fair Complexion, which is rare in this Coun|try,
and the others Hair is as black as Jet. Their Beauty &s;ur|prized
me, and they wanted only, in my mind, to be a little
fat. But this is not reckoned a Defect in this Country, where
they fancy leanne&s;s &s;o much, that they de&s;ire only to have Skin
and Bone. The &s;ingular Dre&s;s of the Counte&s;s <HI>de Lemos,</HI> ap|peared
to me &s;o extraordinary, that I could hardly get mine
eyes off of it. She wore a kind of Black Sattin Gold embroider|ed
Bodice, and buttoned with great Rubies of con&s;iderable
value. This Bodice came down from her Neck ju&s;t like a
Doublet; her Sleeves were &s;trait, with large Wings about her
&s;houlders, and other Sleeves hanging as low as her Gown, which
<PB N="83" REF="86">
were fa&s;tened on each &s;ide with Ro&s;es of Diamonds; She had
a dreadful Virdingal, which hindred her from &s;itting, other|wi&s;e
then on the Ground. She wore a Ruff, and &s;everal Chains
of great Pearls and Diamonds; her Hair was white, which &s;he
hid under a Coverture of black Lace, for &s;he was no le&s;s than
75 years old. She &s;eemed to me to have been a great Beauty
in her time; her face had not a wrinkle, and her eyes were
&s;till &s;parkling, and her white and red Paint became her very
well: Her wit and Per&s;onage, as I have been told, were
not a little famous in the World. I lookt upon her as a curious
Piece of Antiquity.</P>
<P>She told me &s;he had the honour to Accompany the Infanta
when &s;he e&s;pou&s;ed <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth. That &s;he became ac|quainted
with the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> when he was in <HI>Flanders,</HI>
and the Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> came thither. You have &s;een this
Queen, <HI>&s;aid I to her, interrupting her,</HI> be plea&s;ed, Madam, to
favour me with a Relation of &s;ome Particulars of her humor.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know then, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;ent
Don <HI>Antonio Pimentel</HI> in quality of Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Stockholm,</HI>
to di&s;cover, as much as in him lay, the Intentions of the
<HI>Swedes.</HI> They had been long Enemies to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI>
and it was not doubted but they would make new attempts to
thwart it, in the de&s;ign of making the Emperours Son King of
the <HI>Romans; Pimentel</HI> was charged to carry on this Affair with
great Circum&s;pection. He was a gallant, witty and hand&s;ome
Per&s;on, and he &s;ucceeded better than could be expected. He
immediately di&s;covered the Queens <HI>Genius,</HI> and ea&s;ily made
him&s;elf her Confident. He &s;oon perceived &s;he was mightily
charmed with Novelties, and that of the crowd of Strangers
which &s;he drew to the Court, the la&s;t come was the mo&s;t fa|voured.
He made it his Task to plea&s;e her, and gained &s;o far
on her Affections, that he became informed by her &s;elf of the
mo&s;t &s;ecret Affairs, and which &s;he ought the mo&s;t to conceal
from him. But what cannot he do, who has found a way to
the heart. The Queens was &s;o inclined to him, that he became
the &s;ole Di&s;po&s;er of the Affections of this Prince&s;s, and by this
means was able to write to the Emperour, and to the Electors,
things &s;o certain and agreeable, as made them ea&s;ily judge that
the Queen of <HI>Sweedlands</HI> Council had no part in the Declara|tion
&s;he made in favour of the King of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>This Intrigue being at an end, 'twas thought the King would
recal <HI>Pimentel,</HI> there appearing no occa&s;ion requiring the Pre|&s;ence
of an Amba&s;&s;ador: But if it were needle&s;s for the King
of <HI>Spain,</HI> that he &s;hould remain at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> 'twas not the &s;ame
<PB N="84" REF="87">
with the Queen, &s;he neglecting nothing whereby to retain him
near her. He attended where-ever &s;he went &s;ince, and many,
who were led by outward Appearances, judged when &s;he left
the Crown to her Co&s;en, &s;he did it with great Satisfaction, be|cau&s;e
&s;he did it with dry Eyes, and had the Courage to harangue
the States with great Force and Eloquence; but the People
were greatly mi&s;taken in the &s;ecret Motives of this Prince&s;s.
Her &s;oul at that time was pierced with the mo&s;t lovely &s;orrow;
&s;he was not a little grieved to yield to the Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> a
Scepter which &s;he thought her &s;elf worthy to wield alone, and
of which &s;he was Lawful Heire&s;s.</P>
<P>This Prince had the Addre&s;s to get it declared, that if &s;he
married &s;he &s;hould chu&s;e him for her Husband.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as this Declaration was made, &s;he began to feel the
weight of the &s;ubjection wherein &s;he was placed; and on the
other hand, the People did not well reli&s;h the being governed
by a Woman. They in&s;i&s;ted more on her Defects than they
minded her Vertues. The Prince contributed under-hand
thereto, and the Queen, who was penetrating, &s;oon per|ceived
it; &s;he ob&s;erved the Inclination the People had to him,
and the wi&s;hes which were made to &s;ee him in the Throne;
&s;he grew every day more and more jealous of this, and pa&s;t
from hence &s;uch a deadly Hatred, that 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for
her to &s;top the Cour&s;e of it. The Prince&s;s pre&s;ence became &s;o
in&s;upportable to her, that perceiving it, he withdrew into an
I&s;land which belonged to him. But he &s;et not out till he had
left good <HI>Memoires</HI> to his Creatures again&s;t the Queens Conduct.</P>
<P>When &s;he &s;aw her &s;elf delivered from an Object, who&s;e &s;ight
was &s;o great an Eye &s;ore, &s;he drew off her Mind from the too
intent pur&s;uit of the Affairs of the Kingdom, and gave way to
her Inclinations to Books. Her marvellous Wit made, in a
&s;hort time, admirable Progre&s;&s;es in the mo&s;t profound Scien|ces;
but the&s;e were not &s;o needful to her as a good Conduct
in the management of her Honour and Intere&s;t. It often hap|pens,
that having &s;pent &s;everal days in her Study, &s;he would
appear di&s;gu&s;ted with her Books, &s;aying, They were good for
nothing but to wa&s;t the Spirits, and mi&s;lead Mens Judgments.
When the Great Men of the Court &s;aw her in this Di&s;po&s;ition,
they approacht her with more familiarity, and then the whole
Bu&s;ine&s;s was to follow the Plea&s;ures of Love, of Plays, Balls,
Turneys, Huntings, and all other Diver&s;ions. She gave up
her &s;elf entirely to them, and nothing could bring her off them;
but &s;he added to this Defect that of enriching Strangers, at the
Expence of her own Subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="88">
The <HI>Swedes</HI> began to murmur at this; the Queen was ad|verti&s;ed
of it; their Complaints appeared to be unju&s;t, and
little re&s;pectful; and being not a little offended at them, &s;he
was &s;o unwi&s;e as to take Vengeance on her &s;elf. In effect, at
the time when 'twas lea&s;t expected, and when &s;he was in a Con|dition
to find le&s;s violent Remedies, &s;he abandoned at one
&s;troak her Crown and Kingdom to her Co&s;en; to this Co&s;en,
I &s;ay, whom &s;he was &s;o far from loving, that &s;he wi&s;h'd him all
the ill &s;he was able; and yet to whom &s;he did &s;o much good,
&s;he thought 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for any to penetrate into the Mo|tives
of this. She pretended by this great &s;troak of Genero&s;i|ty,
to di&s;tingui&s;h her &s;elf from among the Heroina's of the mo&s;t
famous Ages: But in effect, the Conduct &s;he held afterwards,
di&s;tingui&s;hed her only to her Di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>She was &s;een to &s;et out from <HI>Swedeland</HI> in a very odd Dre&s;s for
a Woman with a kind of Ju&s;taucorps, a &s;hort Petticoat, with
Boots and Cravat, in a Perriwig, a Hat covered with Feathers,
and this Perriwig tied up in a lock behind, which &s;eemed then
very ridiculous. She forbad all her Women to follow her,
choo&s;ing only Men to &s;erve her, and attend her. She was
wont ordinarily to &s;ay, That &s;he did not love Men as Men,
but becau&s;e they were not Women. So that &s;he &s;eemed to
have renounced her Sex in renouncing her States, although &s;he
had &s;ometimes &s;uch Weakne&s;&s;es, as would have made the mean|e&s;t
Women a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>The tru&s;ty <HI>Pimentel</HI> pa&s;t over into <HI>Flanders</HI> with her, and I
being then there, <HI>continues &s;he,</HI> I &s;aw him arrive; he procured
me the honour to ki&s;s her hand, and there needed no le&s;s than
his Credit to obtain this: for &s;he &s;ent word to all the Ladies of
<HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> &s;he would excu&s;e them for their Vi&s;its.
Yet &s;he received me very well, and the little &s;he &s;aid to me,
appeared full of Wit and extraordinary Vivacity; but &s;he &s;wore
at every turn like a Souldier, and her Words and Actions were
&s;o free, not to &s;ay &s;o di&s;hone&s;t, that were it not for her Rank,
her Per&s;on would have been little regarded.</P>
<P>She &s;pake before every Body of the pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire &s;he
had to &s;ee the Prince of <HI>Conde;</HI> that his great Actions had
charmed her, and that &s;he was de&s;irous to learn the Trade of
War nnder him. The Prince had no le&s;s de&s;ire to &s;ee her, than
&s;he te&s;tified to &s;ee him. In the mid&s;t of this mutual Impati|ence,
the Queen &s;topt on a &s;udden on &s;ome Formalities and
Steps which &s;he refu&s;ed to take, when he &s;hould come to &s;a|lute
her. The&s;e Rea&s;ons hindred her from &s;eeing her with the
u&s;ual Ceremonies. But one day, when the Queen's Chamber
<PB N="86" REF="89">
was full of Courtiers, the Prince &s;lipt therein; whether &s;he
had &s;een his Picture, or that his Martial Ayr had di&s;tingui&s;hed
him from among other, &s;he had &s;ingled him out, and knew
him. She would immediately hereupon have te&s;tified as much
to him, by extraordinary Civilities. He pre&s;ently retired,
and &s;he followed to conduct him. Then he &s;topt, and content|ed
him&s;elf with &s;aying the&s;e words, <HI>Either All, or Nothing.</HI>
Some few days after, an Interview was &s;et on foot to be be|tween
them in the <HI>Mall</HI> in the Park at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> where they &s;pake
together with great Civility and much Coldne&s;s.</P>
<P>As to Don <HI>Antonio Pimentel,</HI> the Favours &s;he has had for
him, have made noi&s;e enough to come to your Ears, and if
you be ignorant of them, Madam, I believe I ought not to un|dertake
to learn you the Particulars, of which perhaps I my
&s;elf may have been ill informed. She held her peace, and I
made my profit of this moment to thank her for Complai&s;ance
in giving me an account of a Queen, who has ever given me
&s;uch a great Curio&s;ity. She askt me afterwards, whether I had
&s;een the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Lerma.</HI> He that built it, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> was Fa|vourite
to <HI>Philip</HI> the Third, who&s;e Death hapned very &s;trange|ly.
This Prince, <HI>continued &s;he,</HI> was writing Letters in his Clo|&s;et,
and it being very cold that day, they had placed very
near him a quick fire of Coals, who&s;e reverberation &s;truck &s;o
much on his face, that he was all in water, as if a great quanti|ty
of it had been poured on his Head. The ea&s;ine&s;s of his tem|per
hindred him from complaining, and even &s;peaking of it;
for he never found fault with any thing. The Marque&s;s <HI>de Po|bar</HI>
having ob&s;erv'd the incommodiou&s;ne&s;s which the King re|ceived
by this extream heat, adverti&s;ed the Duke <HI>de Alva's</HI> Gen|tleman
of his Chamber of it, to the end he might remove the
Fire away: He replied, It was not his Office, and that the
Duke <HI>Due&s;da</HI> ought to be made acquainted with it who&s;e pro|per
Bu&s;ine&s;s it was. The Marque&s;s <HI>de Pobar</HI> being troubled to
&s;ee the King thus &s;uffer, and not daring him&s;elf to ea&s;e him,
for fear of invading anothers Province, left the fire &s;till in its
place; but he &s;ent to give notice of it to the Duke <HI>Due&s;da,</HI> who
was by Misfortune gone near <HI>Madrid</HI> to &s;ee a &s;tately Hou&s;e he
was there building. Word was brought of this again to the Mar|que&s;s
<HI>de Pobar,</HI> who propo&s;ed again to the Duke <HI>de Alva</HI> the taking
away the fire. But he found him &s;o inflexible hereunto, and cho&s;e
rather to &s;end into the Country, to the Duke <HI>Due&s;da,</HI> &s;o that be|fore
he was come, the King was almo&s;t &s;pent, and that very
Night he fell into a violent Fever, accompanied with an Eri&s;i|pellis,
which inflamed, and the inflammation degenerated into the
Purples, which cau&s;ed his Death.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="90">
I mu&s;t confe&s;s, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> that having &s;een when I was abroad
in the World, other Courts be&s;ides our own, I could not for|bear
blaming the&s;e kind of Ceremonies and Punctilio's which
hinder the taking of one &s;tep fa&s;ter than another, tho' life de|pended
thereon. The old Counte&s;s of <HI>Lemo's</HI> loved to talk, and
continuing her Di&s;cour&s;e, and among other names mentioned
that of the Count <HI>de Villa Mediana.</HI> I have heard, &s;aid I <HI>inter|rupting
her,</HI> that this Gentleman, being one day in the Church
of our Lady <HI>de Arocha,</HI> and finding there a <HI>Religio's,</HI> who begged
for the Souls in <HI>Purgatory,</HI> he gave them a piece of four pounds.
<HI>Ah my Lord,</HI> &s;aid the good Father, <HI>you have now delivered a
Soul.</HI> The <HI>Count</HI> drew out again a like piece and put it into
the Ba&s;on. <HI>Here's,</HI> continued the <HI>Religio&s;o, another Soul deli|ved:</HI>
He gave him in this manner &s;ix, one after another, and at
the droping of each piece, the <HI>Monk</HI> cryed <HI>Here's a Soul deli|vered
from</HI> Purgatory. <HI>Will you be po&s;itive in it,</HI> replyed the
<HI>Count. Yes, my Lord</HI> replyed the <HI>Monk, I am certain they are
now in</HI> Heaven. <HI>Give me now then back again my &s;ix pieces,</HI> &s;aid,
he, <HI>for they &s;ignifie nothing to you, &s;eeing the Souls are already got
to</HI> Heaven, <HI>there's no danger of their returning again to</HI> Purgatory.
It was as you relate, <HI>Added the Counte&s;s,</HI> but he took not again
his Money, for this would have been among us an horrid <HI>Sacri|ledge.</HI>
And I knew a man of good quality, who being much
behind in the World, yet when he was dying, would have
fifteen thou&s;and Ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid for him. His la&s;t Will was
executed, and his poor Creditors defrauded, for how ju&s;t &s;oe|ver
their Debts be, they can expect to receive nothing, till &s;uch
time as all the Ma&s;&s;es which are left in the Will be &s;aid. And
this has given occa&s;ion to that common &s;aying among us, <HI>That
&s;uch an one has made his Soul his Heir;</HI> whereby is meant, that
he has left his E&s;tate to the <HI>Church</HI> to &s;ay Prayers for him.</P>
<P>King <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth ordered in his will an hundred thou|&s;and
<HI>Ma&s;&s;es</HI> to be &s;aid for him; farther declaring, That &s;hould
he cea&s;e needing them, they &s;hould &s;erve for his Father and
Mother, and in ca&s;e they were got to <HI>Heaven,</HI> they &s;hould be appli'd
to the Souls of tho&s;e who were &s;lain in the Wars of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>But what I have already told you of the Count <HI>de Villa Me|diana,</HI>
brings to my mind, that he being one day at Church with
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> he &s;aw a great deal of Money on the Altar,
which was given for the Souls in <HI>Purgatory.</HI> He drew near,
and took it up in his hand, &s;aying, <HI>My Love will la&s;t for ever,
my Pains will be likewi&s;e</HI> Eternal, <HI>tho&s;e of the Souls in</HI> Purgatory
<HI>will have an end; alas, mine will never end: This hope comforts
them; as for me, I am without hope and comfort, &s;o that the&s;e
<PB N="88" REF="91">
Charities are more due to me, than they.</HI> However, he took
nothing away, only &s;peaking the&s;e words as an occa&s;ion to
bring in his Pa&s;&s;ion before this beautiful Queen, who was
there pre&s;ent: For in effect, his was &s;o violent for her, that
there is &s;ome rea&s;on to think &s;he was not wholly in&s;en&s;ible of
it, if her rigid Virtue had not pre&s;erved her heart again&s;t the
Count's Merit. He was young, well &s;haped, hand&s;ome, brave,
magnificent, gallant and witty; every Body knows how he ap|peared
to his Misfortune in a <HI>Caro&s;el</HI> at <HI>Madrid,</HI> with a Suit em|broidered
with pieces of new Money called <HI>Realles,</HI> and which
he bore for a Device;
<Q>MIS AMORES SON REALES.</Q>
making an allu&s;ion to the word <HI>Realles,</HI> which is to &s;ay <HI>Royal,</HI>
with the Pa&s;&s;ion he had for the Queen. This is &s;iner in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI>
and &s;ignifies in <HI>Engli&s;h, My Love is Royal.</HI></P>
<P>The Count Duke <HI>de Olivarez,</HI> the Kings Favourite, and the
&s;ecret Enemy to the <HI>Queen</HI> and the <HI>Count,</HI> made his Ma&s;ter
take notice of the boldne&s;s of the Subject, who dared even in
his Pre&s;ence declare the Sentiments he had for the <HI>Queen;</HI> and
in this moment he per&s;waded the King to be revenged on him.
An Occa&s;ion was waited for which &s;hould make no noi&s;e. But
here's what ha&s;tned his Ruine; applying his Mind only to di|vert
the <HI>Queen,</HI> he wrote a <HI>Comedy</HI> which every Body likes,
and the <HI>Queen,</HI> more than others, found therein &s;uch moving
and delicate &s;troaks in it, that &s;he would act apart in it her &s;elf
on the <HI>Kings Birth-Day.</HI> It was the Amorous Count, who ma|naged
and took care of the Fe&s;tival, he ordered the Cloaths,
and provided Machines, which co&s;t him above Thirty thou|&s;and
Crowns. He had cau&s;ed a great <HI>Cloud</HI> to be painted, un|der
which the <HI>Queen</HI> was concealed in a Machine. He &s;tood
very near it, and at a certain &s;ign he gave a Man who was
faithful to him, he &s;et fire to the linnen work of the Cloud.
The whole Hou&s;e valued at an hundred thou&s;and Crowns, was
in a manner con&s;umed; but he comforted him&s;elf, when ma|king
his advantage of this favourable Opportunity, he took
his Soveraign in his Arms, carryed her into a little by-place,
and there &s;tole from her &s;ome Favours; and that which is
much taken notice of in this Country, is, that he touched her
foot. A little Page who &s;aw him, informed the Count Duke of
it, he did not doubt but when he &s;aw the fire, but this was an
effect of the Count's Pa&s;&s;ion. He made &s;uch an exact En|quiry,
that he laid before the King certain Proofs of it; and
<PB N="89" REF="92">
his Proofs &s;o greatly enraged the King, that 'tis pretended he
cau&s;ed him to be &s;hot with a Pi&s;tol one night, as he was in his
Coach with Don <HI>Lewis de Haro.</HI></P>
<P>Here's a very Tragical end, <HI>&s;aid I to her, interrupting her;</HI> but
whil&s;t, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I am &s;peaking to you of <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, I
cannot but I mu&s;t tell you, that he was vehemently in love with
the Dutche&s;s <HI>Dalberkerke.</HI> He could never meet with a favou|rable
opportunity of Entertaining her. The Duke her Husband
kept &s;trict guard over her, and the more Ob&s;tacles the King
met with, the more his De&s;ires increa&s;ed; but when Night
came, and when he was at play, he feign'd to call to mind he
had a Letter to write of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence. He called
the Duke <HI>Dalburkerke,</HI> who was in his Chamber, and de&s;ired
him to take his place, and continue his Game. He immediately
hereupon entred into his Clo&s;et, di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf, and went down
by a back Stairs, and came to the young Dutche&s;s with the Count
Duke his Favourite.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>Dalburkerke,</HI> who&s;e mind ran on his Dome&s;tick
Intere&s;ts more then on his Game, ea&s;ily believed his Ma&s;ter
would not have committed it to him, without &s;ome &s;ecret De|&s;ign.
He began then to complain of an horrid Collick, and uttering
Cries and making Faces enough to fright one, he gave the Cards
to another, and without any &s;top ran home. The King had only
ju&s;t arrived there without any Train, he was then in the Court,
and &s;eeing the Duke come he hid him&s;elf; but there is nothing &s;o
clear &s;ighted as a Jealous Husband. He perceived the King, and
being not willing to have Lights brought that he might not be ob|liged
to acknowledge him, he made up to him with a great Cane
which he commonly walked with: <HI>Ha! Ha! Villain,</HI> &s;aid he
to him, <HI>thou come&s;t to rob my Hou&s;e;</HI> and without more words
he laid on him with all his &s;trength. The Count Duke was no
more &s;pared, who fearing lea&s;t wor&s;e might happen, cried, out
&s;everal times, <HI>'Twas the King,</HI> to &s;top the Duke's Fury: but this
was &s;o far from effecting it, that he redoubled his blows both
on the Prince and his Mini&s;ter, crying in his turn, <HI>That this was
a &s;troak of the greate&s;t In&s;olence, to make u&s;e of his Maje&s;ty's Name
and his Favourites in &s;uch an occa&s;ion, that he could find in his heart
to (end them to the Palace, becau&s;e he well knew the King would
cau&s;e them to be hanged.</HI> In all this Fray the King &s;aid not a
word, and at length got away half mad, in having received &s;o
many blows, and not one favour from his Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>This produced no ill Con&s;equences to the Duke <HI>Dalburkerke,</HI>
but on the contrary, the King being cured of his Love to the
Dutche&s;s made a Je&s;t of it &s;ome time after. I know not whe|ther
<PB N="90" REF="93">
I do not abu&s;e your patience by the length of this Con|ver&s;ation,
<HI>added the Counte&s;s</HI> de Lemos, and I fall in&s;en&s;ible in|to
the defect of per&s;ons of my Age, who forget them&s;elves
when they tell of things done in their time. I &s;aw &s;he was for
retiring, and having again thankt her for the honour &s;he had
done me, I took my leave of her, and returned to my Inn.</P>
<P>The Weather was &s;o foul, that we with great difficulty &s;et
out, but being re&s;olved on it, we marcht as long as the day
la&s;ted, falling down and getting up as well as we could. We
could hardly &s;ee four Paces before us, the Storm was &s;o great,
that it blew off &s;everal Stones off the Rocks, which fell into our
way, and hurt one of our Company; he had been killed, had
he not &s;tept on one &s;ide. In fine, after having made about
eight Leagues, according to our reckoning, we were much a|&s;toni&s;ht
to find our &s;elves at the Gates of <HI>Lerma,</HI> without ha|ving
advanced or gone back. We had &s;till turn'd about the
Town, without perceiving it, as it were by Enchantment,
&s;ometimes farther, &s;ometimes nearer; and we were all of us
not a little out of humour at having taken &s;o much pains to &s;o
little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Ho&s;te&s;s tran&s;ported at the &s;ight of us, &s;he who could
have been glad with all her heart we &s;hould thus Travel as long
as we lived, to return to lye at her Hou&s;e every night, tarried
for me at the top of her little Stair-ca&s;e. She told me &s;he was
very &s;orry &s;he could not let me have my Room again, but would
give me another commodious enough, and that mine was ta|ken
up by a <HI>Seignora,</HI> the greate&s;t in <HI>Spain. Don Fernand</HI> askt
her name, &s;he told him, &s;he was called Don <HI>Eleonora</HI> of <HI>Toledo;</HI>
he as &s;oon informed me &s;he was his near Kin&s;woman. He could
not comprehend by what chance &s;he &s;hould come there.</P>
<P>To be &s;atisfied in the matter, he &s;ent his Gentlemen to make
her a Compliment, and to know whether his vi&s;it would not
be trouble&s;ome. She &s;ent word, &s;he had a great Satisfaction
at this happy Meeting, and that he would do her a great deal
of honour. He went up immediately to her Chamber, and
was informed by her of &s;everal particulars which related to
him. He came afterwards to me, and told me very civilly,
that were not Donna <HI>Eleonora</HI> exce&s;&s;ive weary and indi&s;po&s;ed,
&s;he would have given me the fir&s;t Vi&s;it. I in &s;hort, de&s;ired
him to conduct me to her Chamber, where &s;he received me in a
mo&s;t obliging manner; and I ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t moment of
our Conver&s;ation, that &s;he had a great deal of Wit and Polite|ne&s;s.
I found her very neat and hand&s;ome, her Eyes were
lively and &s;o gli&s;tring, that one could not without pain endure

were called <HI>Ricos-homes,</HI> which were as the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI>
now. The <HI>Ricos-homes,</HI> &s;tood covered before the <HI>King,</HI> en|tred
among the States, and had their <HI>Active</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive</HI> voice.
And the <HI>Titulado's</HI> at pre&s;ent, are the &s;ame which were then
called <HI>Ricos-homes;</HI> but their Priviledges are not &s;o large, and
mo&s;t of the&s;e Honours, as I &s;hall tell you, have been re&s;erv'd
to the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> The <HI>Titulado's</HI> may have a Canopy
or Cloth of State in their Chamber, a Coach in <HI>Madrid</HI> with
four Hor&s;es, with <HI>los tiros largos,</HI> which are long Traces of Silk
which fa&s;ten the la&s;t Hor&s;es to the foremo&s;t. When there
are <HI>Bull-Fea&s;ts,</HI> they have Balconies in the great place, where
their Wives are regaled with Baskets full of Sweetmeats,
Gloves, Ribbons, Fans, Silk-ho&s;e, and this at the King or
Towns charge, which gives the Fea&s;t. They have their Seat
&s;et out in their Ceremonies, and when the King makes a <HI>Titu|lado,</HI>
Marque&s;s of <HI>Ca&s;tille, Arragon,</HI> or <HI>Grenada,</HI> he enters into
the States of this <HI>Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Grandees,</HI> there are three different Ranks of them;
and the manner in which the King &s;peaks to them in making
them, di&s;tingui&s;hes them. The one are tho&s;e whom he bids
be <HI>covered,</HI> without adding any thing thereto; their Grandure
is only fixt to their Per&s;on, and is not con&s;erved to their Family.</P>
<P>The others, whom the <HI>King</HI> qualifies with the Title of one
of their Lands, as for Example, <HI>Duke</HI> or <HI>Marque&s;s</HI> of &s;uch a
place, <HI>Cover your &s;elf, for you, and for yours,</HI> are <HI>Grandees</HI> in a
more advantagious manner than the fir&s;t, becau&s;e their Gran|dure
being fixt to their e&s;tates, pa&s;&s;es to their elde&s;t Son, and
if they have none, to their Daughter or Heir.</P>
<P>The la&s;t are not covered till after they have &s;poken to the
<PB N="92" REF="95">
King; and the difference between the&s;e is ob&s;erved in &s;aying,
<HI>They are Grandees for Life, or in their Race.</HI> It is farther to be
ob&s;erved, That there are &s;ome whom the King makes be co|vered
before they &s;peak to him, in &s;aying to them <HI>Cubridos;</HI> and
they &s;peak, and hear the King &s;peak, ever covered. Others
who are only covered after they have &s;poke to him, and he
has an&s;wered them. And the third, who are only covered
when they have withdrawn them&s;elves from the King towards
the Wall, but when they be altogether in publick Offices, or at
Chappel, there is no difference between them they &s;it down and
are covered before him. And when he writes to them, he treats
them as if they were <HI>Princes,</HI> they have the Titles of <HI>Excellency</HI>
given them. When their Wives go to the Queen, &s;he receives
them &s;tanding, and in&s;tead of &s;itting on the Foot cloth, they
have Cu&s;hions brought them to &s;it on.</P>
<P>Here's Madam, <HI>continued Donna Eleonora,</HI> what you de&s;ired to
know; after due thanks for her Civility, the hour of withdraw|ing
being come, I took my leave of her, entreating her to con|tinue
me in her Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e before day, becau&s;e we had a great Journey to
make to lye at <HI>Arando de Duero.</HI> The Weather growing milder,
it became very mi&s;ty, which at length turned to Rain; and
in arriving at Night, our Ho&s;t told us we were very welcome
to him, but we mu&s;t make a &s;hift without Bread. This is, <HI>re|plied
I,</HI> a thing one cannot ea&s;ily be without. And in effect,
this News put me a little out of humour. I enquired how
hapned this Scarcity; 'twas an&s;wered me, The <HI>Alcaid Major</HI> of
the Town (who is he that orders every thing) and who is both
<HI>Governour</HI> and <HI>Judge</HI> had &s;ent for all the Bread and Meal which
was at the Bakers, and had brought it into his Hou&s;e to make
an equal Di&s;tribution of it, proportionable to the Nece&s;&s;ities
of each particular Per&s;on, and that which had occa&s;ioned this,
was that the River of <HI>Duero,</HI> which pa&s;&s;es about the Town, was
frozen, and the Rivers of <HI>Leon, Suegra, Burgos, Tormes</HI> and <HI>Sa|lamanca,</HI>
which threw and lo&s;t them&s;elves therein, had like|wi&s;e
cea&s;ed their Cour&s;es, &s;o that no Mills could grind, which
made them apprehend a Famine: This obliged us to addre&s;s our
&s;elves to him for to have the Bread we needed: <HI>Don Fernand</HI>
&s;ent him one of his Gentlemen in the Name of us all, and imme|diately
we had &s;o much Bread &s;ent us, that we gave part to
our Ho&s;t and his Family, who much wanted it.</P>
<P>Scarce were we at Table, when one of my Servants brought
into my Chamber &s;everal Packets of Letters, which they had
found on the Stairs in the Inn. He that carried them having
<PB N="93" REF="96">
drank more than he needed, had fallen there a&s;leep, by which
means all his Letters lay expo&s;ed to the Curio&s;ity of all that pa&s;t
by. Here is in this Country a very ill order touching Com|merce,
and when the <HI>French</HI> Currier arrives at St. <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> all
the Letters he brings are delivered to others who are good Foot|men,
and ea&s;e one another. They put the&s;e Packets into a
Sack, tied with rotten Cords to their &s;houlders, by which
means it oft happens, that the &s;ecrets of your Heart and Fami|ly
are open to the fir&s;t curious Body who makes drunk this Foot
po&s;t; and this is what hapned in this Occa&s;ion; for Don <HI>Fre|deric
de Cardonne</HI> having lookt on the Super&s;criptions of &s;everal
Letters, he at la&s;t met with one from a Lady in whom he was
apparently intere&s;&s;ed, at lea&s;t I &s;o judged from the emotion of
his Countenance, and earne&s;tne&s;s with which he opened the
Packet. He read the Letter, and was willing to &s;hew it me,
without telling me from whom it came, nor for whom it was;
but he promi&s;ed to inform me further about it at <HI>Madrid,</HI> fin|ding
it well writ, it came into my mind that you would be
perhaps glad to &s;ee the &s;tyle of a <HI>Spani&s;h Lady,</HI> when &s;he writes
to what &s;he loves. I prayed the <HI>Knight</HI> to let me take a Copy
of it; but 'tis certain the Tran&s;lation takes away much of the
beauty of the Original. Here it is.</P>
<P>EVery thing contributes to afflict me in the unfortunate Amba&s;&s;y
you have undertaken, not to mention that di&s;tance is the bane
of the &s;tronge&s;t Friend&s;hip. I cannot flatter my &s;elf, that a Rup|ture
between the Sovereigns, may abridge the time of your ab|&s;ence,
and re&s;tore me a Good without which I can no longer live.
Of all the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> he to whom you are &s;ent, is the
mo&s;t at Vnion with us. I can fore&s;ee no War with him, and this
Scourge with which Heaven puni&s;hes the guilty, would be to me a
thou&s;and times more welcome than Peace: Yes, I would be glad to
bear alone all the Di&s;a&s;ters of it, to &s;ee my Lands wa&s;ted, my Hou&s;es
burnt, to lo&s;e my E&s;tate and my Liberty, provided we could be to|gether,
and that without you &s;hare in my Di&s;graces, I could enjoy
the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you; you may judge by the&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions of
the Condition I am in, when I think that you are really going away,
that <HI>I</HI> remain at <HI>Madrid,</HI> that I dare not follow you, that my
Duty &s;tifles immediately the Projects I might make to comfort my
&s;elf, and that I lo&s;e you, in fine, in a time wherein I have mo&s;t rea|&s;on
to be per&s;waded of yours, and wherein I feel more the Marks you
gave me of it; I &s;hould conceal from you my Grief, and add $ore
to yours; but how can I weep and weep without you. Alas, Alas $
I &s;hall be &s;oon forced to weep alone, are you not afraid &s;o lively an
<PB N="94" REF="97">
Affliction will kill me, and can you not feign your &s;elf &s;ick, that
you may not leave me, think of all the Advantages which are in|cluded
in this Propo&s;ition; but I am a Fool to make it you, you
will prefer the King's O$ders before mine, and 'twould bring me into
new Vexations to put you on &s;uch a proof. Adieu, I ask you nothing,
becau&s;e I have too much to ask you; I was never &s;o afflicted.</P>
<P>As I ended the Tran&s;lating of this Letter which I &s;end you, the
<HI>Alcade</HI>'s Son came to &s;ee me; he was a young man who had a
good Opinion of him&s;elf, and who was a true <HI>Guap.</HI> Let not
this word offend you (<HI>dear Co&s;en</HI>) <HI>Guap</HI> is the &s;ame in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI>
as a brave Gallant and Spark is with us; his Hair was parted
on the Crown of his Head, and tied behind with a blue Ribond
about four &s;ingers breadth, and about two yards long, which
hung down at its full length; his Breeches were of black Velvet,
buttoned down on each Knee with five or &s;ix Buttons, he had
a Ve&s;t on &s;o &s;hort, that it &s;carce reacht below his Pockets, a
Scollopt Doublet with hanging &s;leeves about four fingers breadth,
made of white embroidered Sattin. His Cloak was of black
Bays, and he being a Spark had wrapt it round his Arm,
becau&s;e this is more gallant, with a very light Buckler in his
hand, and which has &s;tanding out in the mid&s;t of a &s;teel Pike;
they carried it with them when they walk in the Night on any
Occa&s;ion, he held in the other hand a Sword longer than an
Half-Pike, and the Iron for its Guard was enough to make a
Brea&s;t and Back-plate. The&s;e Swords being &s;o long, that they
cannot be drawn out, unle&s;s a Man has the Arms of a Giant:
the Sheaf therefore flies open in laying the finger on a little
Spring. He had likewi&s;e a Dagger, who&s;e Blade was very nar|row,
it was fa&s;tned to his Belt on his back; he had &s;uch a &s;trait
Collar, that he could neither &s;toop nor turn about his Head.
Nothing can be more ridiculous than what they wear about
their Necks, for it is neither a Ruff nor a Band, nor a Cravat.
His Hat was a prodigious &s;ize, with a great Band twi&s;ted about
it, bigger then a mourning one. His Shoo$s were of as fine
Leather as that whereof Gloves are made, and all &s;la&s;ht and
cut, notwith&s;tanding the cold, and &s;o exactly clo&s;e to his Feet,
that they &s;eemed rather pa&s;ted on, and having no Heels. He
made me in entring a Reverence after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion, his
two Leggs cro&s;s one another and lowly &s;tooping as Women
do when they Salute one another, he was &s;trongly perfumed,
and they are all &s;o; his Vi&s;it was not long; he was very brisk,
he forgat not to tell me he went oft to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and that
there were no Cour&s;es of Bulls, wherein he ventured not his
life. But as the little Care which was taken of Letters, run in
<PB N="95" REF="98">
my mind, and troubled me; I told him of the <HI>Courrier</HI> whom
my People had found a&s;leep on the Stairs. He an&s;wered me,
this hapned from the neglect of the great Po&s;t-ma&s;ter, or to
&s;peak better, in that he would gain too much, and that if the
King knew of it, he would not &s;uffer it. This Name of <HI>Great
Po&s;t-ma&s;ter</HI> made me enquire of him, whether any one rode
Po&s;t in <HI>Spain.</HI> He told me, yes; provided they had the
King's leave, or of the Great Ma&s;ter, who is always a Per&s;on
of a di&s;tinct Birth; and that unle&s;s you have an Order well
&s;igned, and in good form, you can have no Hor&s;es. But, <HI>&s;aid
I to him,</HI> a Man who has fought a Duel, or has other Rea&s;ons
to ha&s;ten away, What does he? Nothing, Madam, <HI>&s;aid he to
me,</HI> if he has good Hor&s;es he makes u&s;e of them, and if he has
not, he is perplext enough, but when one will go Po&s;t, and
parts not directly from <HI>Madrid,</HI> it is &s;ufficient to take a Billet
from the <HI>Alcade,</HI> which is to &s;ay, Governour of the Towns
where you pa&s;s. My Curio&s;ity being &s;atisfied on this Subject,
the gallant <HI>Spaniard</HI> withdrew, and we &s;upt altogether, as we
were wont.</P>
<P>I had been &s;ome time in Bed and a&s;leep, when I was awake|ned
by the ringing of Bells, and by a confu&s;ed Noi&s;e of dread|ful
Voices. I knew not as yet what was the Cau&s;e, when Don
<HI>Fernand de Toledo,</HI> and Don <HI>Frederic de Cardonne,</HI> without
knocking at my Door, bur&s;t it open, and calling out to me,
as loud as they could to make me hear (for they had Light)
came both of them to my Bed, and throwing my Gown upon
me, they carried me away, with my Daughter, as quick as
they could to the top of the Hou&s;e. It is impo&s;&s;ible to repre|&s;ent
to you my a&s;toni&s;hment and fear, I askt them at length,
what was the matter? They told me the Thaw was come
down all of a &s;udden, with &s;uch a great violence, that the Bi|vers
being &s;welled by the Torrents which fell from all &s;ides of
the Mountains, with which the Town is &s;urrounded, had fallen
on it, and overflowed it, that at the in&s;tant when they came
to take me, the Water had already got to my Chamber, and
that all was in horrid Confu&s;ion, they needed &s;ay no more, for
I heard dreadful Cries and Shrieks, and the Water &s;hook the
whole Hou&s;e. I was never &s;o &s;eized with Fear in all my life;
I affectionately regretted my dear Country! <HI>Alas!</HI> &s;aid I, $word$
<HI>have travelled a long way to come to drown my &s;elf on the Fourth
Story of an Inn in</HI> Aranda. All Raillery apart, I thought &s;eri|ou&s;ly
my la&s;t hour was come, and I was &s;o troubled, that I was
twenty times thinking to entreat the&s;e Gentlemen to hear me
in Confe&s;&s;ion. I believe that in the &s;equel they would have
<PB N="96" REF="99">
more laught at it than I. We were till Day in continual A|larms;
but the <HI>Alcade,</HI> and the Inhabitants of the Town &s;o
&s;peedily and effectually be&s;tirred them&s;elves in turning a&s;ide the
Torrents, and making the Water$s pa&s;s, that we were only
affrighted, two of our Mules were drowned, my Litters and
Cloaths were &s;o &s;oakt in Water, that to dry them, we were
&s;orced to tarry one whole Day; and this was no ea&s;ie matter,
for there are no Chimneys in the Inns, they heated the Oven,
and put my Cloaths in it. I can a&s;&s;ure you, I have not gained
any thing in this unhappy Inundation, I lay down after this,
or to &s;peak better. I bathed my &s;elf, my Bed being as wet as
any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>My fellow Travellers thought fit to let me re&s;t a little; I
have employed one part of my lei&s;ure time in writing to you.
Adieu dear Co&s;en, it is time to fini&s;h: I am ever, more yours,
than any Bodies in the World.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE Exactne&s;s I ob&s;erve in giving you an Account of things
which I judge worthy of your Curio&s;ity, puts me often
times on Enquiries into &s;everal Particulars which I &s;hould have
otherwi&s;e omitted, had you not per&s;waded me that you are a
great lover of Novelties, and that you love to Travel without
going out of your Clo&s;ets.</P>
<P>We parted from <HI>Aranda</HI> in a time of Thaw, which as it ren|dred
the Air warmer, &s;o it made the ways more trouble&s;ome.
We came a while after to the Mountain <HI>de Samoziorra,</HI> which
parts the <HI>Old Ca&s;tille</HI> from the New, and we traver&s;t it not
without difficulty, as well for its heighth, as the quantity of
Snow, with which the bottoms were filled, and into which
we &s;ometimes fell as from Precipices, believing the way even.
They call this Pa&s;s the <HI>Puerto,</HI> which name methinks &s;hould be
only given to a part, where one Embarks on the Sea, or a
River, but it is thus, they call the Pa&s;&s;age from one Kingdom
to another, and you make your way to your co&s;t, for the <HI>Kings
Officers</HI> wait for Travellers in the Road, and let them not go till
they have paid what they require.</P>
<P>In arriving at <HI>Buitrago,</HI> we were as wet as the night of the
$nundation at <HI>Aranda,</HI> and tho' I kept my Litter, I felt no
<PB N="97" REF="100">
le&s;s the Incommodiou&s;ne&s;s of the Weather, than if I had been
on foot or Hor&s;eback, becau&s;e the Litters are &s;o ill clo&s;ed and
made in this Country, that when the Mules pa&s;s through any
Water, they throw up with their Feet part of the Water into
the Litter, which there remains. So that I was forced in ar|riving,
to change my Linnen and Cloaths. Afterwards Don
<HI>Fernand,</HI> the three Knights, my Daughter, and my Women,
went with me to the Ca&s;tle I had been &s;o often told of.</P>
<P>It appeared to me as regularly built as that of <HI>Lerma,</HI> not &s;o
large, but every whit as plea&s;ant: The Apartments are better
contrived, and the Furniture is richer and very &s;ingular as
well for its Antiquity as Magnificence. This Ca&s;tle, as well
as that of <HI>Lerma,</HI> belongs to Don <HI>Rodrigo de Silva de Mendo&s;a,</HI>
Duke <HI>de Pa&s;trana</HI> and <HI>de L'infantada.</HI> His Mothers Name is
Donna <HI>Katherina de Mendo&s;a &amp; Sandoval,</HI> Heire&s;s of the Dutchy's
of <HI>Infantada</HI> and <HI>Lerma.</HI> It de&s;cends from Father to Son of
<HI>Ruy Gomes de Silva,</HI> who was made Duke of <HI>Pa&s;trana,</HI> and
Prince of <HI>Eboly</HI> by King <HI>Philip</HI> the Second. This Prince&s;s
<HI>de Eboly,</HI> who has been &s;o much talkt of for her Beauty, was
his Wife, and the King was pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her:
They &s;hewed me her Picture, &s;he is repre&s;ented at her whole
length, &s;itting under a Tent fa&s;tned to &s;ome Boughs of Trees,
&s;he &s;eems as if &s;he were ri&s;ing, for &s;he has only a fine Linnen|cloth
on her, which lets one part of her body be &s;een. If &s;he
were as hand&s;ome as her Picture makes her, and if her Features
were &s;o regular, &s;he mu&s;t be judged the mo&s;t charming Wo|man
in the World; her Eyes are &s;o lively and full of Spirit,
that it &s;eems as if &s;he was about &s;peaking to you; her Neck,
Arms, Feet, and Leggs are naked; her Hair falls down on her
Brea&s;ts, and little Cupids which appear every where about her,
pre&s;s on one another to &s;erve her, &s;ome had her Slippers,
others are ready to &s;trew flowers on her, and &s;ome hold her
looking Gla&s;s. Others are &s;een farther off, who are &s;harpning
their Arrows, whil&s;t others fill their Quivers with them, and
bend their Bow: A Fawn looks on her through Boughs, &s;he
&s;ees him and &s;hews him to a little Cupid, who is leaning on her
Knees, and weeps as if &s;he was afraid of it, at which &s;he &s;eems
to &s;mile. I remained a great while looking on this Picture
with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure, but I was made to pa&s;s into a Gal|lery,
where I &s;aw her again. She was painted in a large Piece
attending Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Daughter to <HI>Henry</HI> the Second King
of <HI>France,</HI> whom <HI>Philip</HI> the Second, King of <HI>Spain</HI> e&s;pou&s;ed,
in&s;tead of giving her to Don <HI>Carlos</HI> his Son, to whom &s;he had
been promi&s;ed. The Queen made her Entrance on Hor&s;eback,
<PB N="98" REF="101">
as 'tis the Cu&s;tom, and I found the Prince&s;s <HI>Eboly</HI> le&s;s &s;hining
near her than &s;he appeared to me when alone. You may hereby
judge of the Charms of this young Queen, &s;he had a blue Sattin
Gown, but as to the re&s;t, ju&s;t as I repre&s;ented to you the Coun|te&s;s
of <HI>Lemos.</HI> The King &s;tood in a Balcony to &s;ee her pa&s;s by.
He had a black Suit with a Collar of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> His Hair
reddi&s;h and gray, long vi&s;age, pale, old, wrinkled and ugly.
The In&s;ant <HI>Don Carlos</HI> accompanied the <HI>Queen,</HI> he was very
white, a fine head, his Hair of a light yellow, his Eyes blue,
and he lookt on the Queen with &s;o moving an Air, that it ap|peared
the Painter knew the Secret of his heart, and would ex|pre&s;s
it: His Habit was white, embroidered with precious
Stones; he was in his Doublet, with his Hat buttoned upon
one &s;ide, and covered with white Feathers. I &s;aw in the &s;ame
Gallery another piece which much affected me, which was the
Prince <HI>Don Carlos</HI> dying, he was &s;itting in a Chair, leaning on
his Arm on a Table before him, holding a Pen in his Hand, as
if he would have wrote &s;omething; there was a Ve&s;&s;el by him,
wherein appeared a &s;ort of black Liquor, which apparently was
de&s;igned for Poy&s;on. A little further you &s;ee the Bath prepa|ring
for him, where his Veins were to be opened; the Pain|ter
had perfectly well repre&s;ented the Confu&s;ion of &s;o &s;ad an
Occa&s;ion, and having read this Hi&s;tory, and being much af|fected
with it, methoughts I &s;aw him really dying. I was told the&s;e
Pieces was of ine&s;timable value. I was afterwards conducted
into a Chamber, who&s;e Furniture had belonged to the Arch-|Dutche&s;s
<HI>Marguerita</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> Governe&s;s of the Low Coun|tries,
and it is pretended &s;he had workt it her &s;elf, there is a
neatly wrought Bed of Flowers, Woods, Animals, and Fea|thers
of all Colours, the hangings are the &s;ame, and the diffe|rent
Colours therein do make a very agreeable &s;hew. And this
is what I &s;ound mo&s;t remarkable in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Buitrago,</HI> and
it growing late we left it.</P>
<P>It was &s;everal days &s;ince I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the play|ing
at <HI>Hombre,</HI> I therefore cau&s;ed the Cards to be brought.
Don <HI>Fernand</HI> with two of the Knights, began the Game, and
I intre&s;ted my &s;elf, as I wont, and Don <HI>E&s;treve de Carvajal</HI>
did the like; &s;o that after we had &s;een them play &s;ome time,
I demanded of him to whom of the three Knights was the
<HI>Commander&s;hip,</HI> whence they came when I met them. He an|&s;wered
me, It did not belong to any one of them, that he had
been to &s;ee one of their common Friends on a vexatious Ac|cident
which had hapned to him in Hunting. Falling on the
Subject of <HI>Commander&s;hips,</HI> I intreated him to inform me whe|ther
<PB N="99" REF="102">
the Orders of St. <HI>James, Calatrava,</HI> and <HI>Alcantara</HI> were
ancient. He an&s;wered me, 'Twas above 500 years they had
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted, that heretofore the Order of <HI>Calatrava</HI> was called
the <HI>Gallant,</HI> that of St. <HI>James,</HI> the <HI>Rich,</HI> and that of <HI>Alcantara</HI>
the <HI>Noble.</HI> That which made them be called thus, was that or|dinarily
there entred only young <HI>Cavaliers</HI> into <HI>Calatrava;</HI>
that St. <HI>James</HI>'s was richer than the two others, and that to
be received a Knight of <HI>Alcantara,</HI> one mu&s;t make his Proofs
of our Races, whereas to enter into the others, there needed
only two. In the fir&s;t times, when the&s;e Orders were e&s;tabli&s;ht,
the Knights made Vows, lived mo&s;t regularly in Community,
and wore Arms only to Combat the <HI>Moors,</HI> but afterward the
greate&s;t Lords of the Kingdom entred into it, who obtained
the liberty to marry, under this Condition, that they &s;hould be
obliged to demand an expre&s;s Di&s;pen&s;ation, from the Holy
See, one mu&s;t have the King's Letter, make his proofs of No|bility,
and likewi&s;e prove he comes of <HI>old Chri&s;tians,</HI> which is
to &s;ay, there have entred no <HI>Jews</HI> nor <HI>Moors</HI> into his Fathers
and Mothers Family. Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the Eighth gave 1489. to
King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;ors, the di&s;po&s;al of all the Com|mander&s;hips
of the&s;e three Orders, which are called <HI>Military.</HI>
The King of <HI>Spain</HI> di&s;po&s;es of them in effect under the Title of
<HI>Perpetual Admini&s;trator;</HI> and he enjoys three great <HI>Ma&s;ter&s;hips,</HI>
which brings him in above four thou&s;and Crowns a Year.
When he holds a Chapter, as Great Ma&s;ter of the Order, or
any other a&s;&s;embly, the Knights have the Priviledge to &s;it and
be covered in his Pre&s;ence. Don <HI>E&s;teve</HI> added, That the Order
of the <HI>Calatrava</HI> had 34 Commander&s;hips, and 8 Priories, va|lued
at 120 thou&s;and Ducats a year; that <HI>Alcantara</HI> had 33
<HI>Commander&s;hips, 4 Alcaydies,</HI> and 4 <HI>Priories</HI> which yielded 80
thou&s;and <HI>Ducats,</HI> and that the 87 <HI>Commander&s;hips</HI> of St. <HI>James,</HI>
as well in <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> as in the Kingdom of <HI>Leon,</HI> were valued at
272000 Ducats. You may hereby judge, Madam, <HI>continued he,</HI>
that there are &s;ome helps for the poor Gentlemen of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>I agree, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> that this would be very advantageous
for them, were they the only Per&s;ons admitted into the&s;e
three Orders. But I think you now told me, that the greate&s;t
Lords po&s;&s;e&s;s the be&s;t <HI>Commander&s;hips.</HI> This is by a general
Rule, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that <HI>tho&s;e who have much will have more,</HI> and
there's the greate&s;t Ju&s;tice others &s;hould have a &s;hare; and the
elde&s;t of great quality might have wherewith to &s;atisfie them
in obtaining the Order of the <HI>Fleece,</HI> which extreamly di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
tho&s;e whom the King honours with it. However, this
<PB N="100" REF="103">
being a Favour accompanied with no Revenue, and being not
ea&s;ily obtained, few People &s;eek it, and you &s;ee ordinarily none
but <HI>Princes</HI> have it. If you know who in&s;tituted this Order of
the <HI>Fleece, &s;aid I to him,</HI> you will oblige me in informing me.
It is pretended, <HI>replied he,</HI> that in the time when the <HI>Moors</HI> po&s;|&s;e&s;t
the be&s;t and greate&s;t part of <HI>Spain,</HI> a pious <HI>Pea&s;ant,</HI> pray|ing
one day earne&s;tly to <HI>God</HI> to deliver the Kingdom from the&s;e
<HI>Infidels,</HI> perceived an <HI>Angel</HI> coming down from Heaven who gave
him a <HI>Fleece of Gold,</HI> and commanding him to make u&s;e of it to
gather Troops, becau&s;e at this &s;ight he would not be refu&s;ed to
be followed for the fighting the Enemy. This holy man obey'd,
and &s;everal Gentlemen took up Arms in effect on what he told
them.</P>
<P>The Succe&s;s of this Enterprize an&s;wered the hope conceived
of it. So that <HI>Philip the Good,</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> in&s;tituted the
Order of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> in the honour of <HI>God,</HI> of the <HI>Virgin,</HI>
and St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> in the year 1429. and the Day of his Marriage
with <HI>I&s;abella</HI> Daughter to the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> was cho&s;en for
this Ceremony. It was made at <HI>Bruges,</HI> it ordained, that the
Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> &s;hould be perpetual Chief of the Order, be|cau&s;e
St. <HI>Andrew</HI> is Patron of <HI>Burgundy.</HI> Tho&s;e who have it are
called <HI>Cav$liero's del Tuzon,</HI> which is to &s;ay, <HI>Knights of the Fleece,</HI>
and one may hence remark, that there is a difference in relati|on
to this Order, &s;aying, when one &s;peaks of the others, That
&s;uch a one is Knight of the order of St. <HI>James,</HI> of the Order of
<HI>Calatrava.</HI></P>
<P>In the time when we were thus talking, we heard a noi&s;e,
as of a Coach and Attendants that &s;topt, not long after, Don <HI>Fre|deric
de Cardone's Valet de Chambre</HI> entred into my Chamber, to
tell his Ma&s;ter, that the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Burgos</HI> was arrived.</P>
<P>This is an happy Encounter for me, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> for I parted ex|pre&s;ly
from <HI>Madrid</HI> to &s;ee him, and having not found him at <HI>Bur|gos.</HI>
I was not a little troubled at it.</P>
<P>Fortune is always on your &s;ide, <HI>&s;aid Don</HI> Sancho <HI>&s;miling to him,</HI>
but not to retard the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing this Illu&s;trious Kin&s;man,
we will leave off our Game. Don <HI>Fernand</HI> and Don <HI>Sancho</HI> aro&s;e.
Undoubtedly, <HI>&s;ays Don</HI> E&s;teve, Don <HI>Frederic</HI> will not be of our
Company this Night. I am of another mind, <HI>replied</HI> Don Fer|nand,
the Archbi&s;hop is one of the mo&s;t obliging Per&s;ons in the
World, a&s;&s;oon as ever he knows here's a <HI>French</HI> Lady, he will
give her a Vi&s;it. He will do me a great deal of honour, <HI>an&s;wered
I,</HI> but yet I &s;hall be a little perplext, for we mu&s;t &s;up and go to
re&s;t betimes. I had &s;carce ended the&s;e words, when Don <HI>Frede|ric</HI>
returned again.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="104">
As &s;oon as ever the Archbi&s;hop knew there was a &s;trange
Lady at <HI>Buytrago, &s;aid he to me,</HI> he no more minded me; and
if you plea&s;e, Madam, he will come and offer you whatever de|pends
on him in this Country.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered this Civility as I ought; and Don <HI>Frederic</HI> being
returned to him, conducted him a while after into my Chamber.
I found him extraordinary civil, he &s;pake little, and ob&s;erved
the <HI>gravity</HI> befitting his Character, and the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Nation. He
much bewailed my making &s;o long a Journey in &s;o rigorous a
Sea&s;on, entreating me <HI>to lay my Commands on him in &s;omething
wherein he might obey me.</HI> This is the u&s;ual Compliment in this
Country, he had a long Ca&s;&s;ock over his other Cloaths of pur|ple
Velvet, with high ruffled Sleeves, which reacht to his very
Ears, and a pair of Spectacles on his No&s;e.</P>
<P>He &s;ent for a little Monkey, which he would needs give my
Daughter, and though I was troubled at it, I could not re&s;i&s;t
his in&s;tances, and the De&s;ires my Daughter had of accepting
it. Every time the Archbi&s;hop took Tobacco, which he often
did, this little Ape reacht out his Paw to him, and he put
&s;ome on it, which he made as if he would take. This Prelate
told me the King of <HI>Spain</HI> expected with extream impatience
the An&s;wer of the Marque&s;s <HI>de Los-Balbares,</HI> on the Orders he
had given him on the Demand of <HI>Madamoi&s;elle</HI> from the <HI>French</HI>
King. If his mo&s;t Catholick Maje&s;ty's Greatne&s;s be con&s;idered,
<HI>continued he,</HI> this Marriage mu&s;t needs be e&s;teemed very ho|nourable,
for when the Sun goes down in one part of his Do|minions,
it ri&s;es again in another. And this Monarch enjoys
not alone his Grandure, he has the Plea&s;ure of &s;haring it to his
Subjects, he is in a Condition to recompence them, to make
them happy, to put them into high places, where their whole
Ambition is &s;atisfied, wherein they receive the &s;ame Honour as
<HI>Soveraigns,</HI> and this is not what a <HI>King</HI> ought to wi&s;h, to be in
a Capacity to recompence magnificently the Services which are
rendred him, and force even an unthankful Per&s;on to become
grateful. It is a &s;urprizing thing, the number of Employs for
Men of the Sword and the Gown, which his Maje&s;ty every day
be&s;tows.</P>
<P>Several Per&s;ons have &s;poken to me of this, as you do, my
Lord, <HI>&s;aid I to him,</HI> but I hope to be perfectly in&s;tructed in it
at <HI>Madrid.</HI> I am able to inform you, at lea&s;t in part of what
you would know, <HI>replied he,</HI> &s;ome Rea&s;ons have obliged me to
take a little Ab&s;tract, and which I think I have about me, he
immediately delivered it to me, and having kept the Copy of
it, and it appearing curious to me, I &s;hall therefore hear, dear
Co&s;en, tran&s;late it for you.</P>

bad a Supper as we.</P>
<P>Yet Don <HI>Fredirick de Cardonna</HI> was already gone to fetch it,
and he returned laden with a great Silver Pot; but he was
much &s;urprized in finding it fa&s;tned with a <HI>Lock:</HI> This is u&s;ual

<PB N="107" REF="110">

unfortunately lo&s;t the Key in the Snow, and knew not how
to open it. <HI>Don Frederic</HI> vext at this, would again&s;t my will,
go and acquaint the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop</HI> with it, who ordered his <HI>Ma|jor
Domo</HI> to look after it; he threatned the Cook, and the Scene
pa&s;t &s;o near my Chamber, that I heard it all, but that which I
liked be&s;t were the Cooks An&s;wers, who &s;aid, <HI>No puedo padecer

This &s;ame Blade was not only vain glorious, but ob&s;tinately

would not deliver the <HI>Key</HI> of the Pot, &s;o that the <HI>Olio</HI> remained
in it untouched for us. We went to Bed late, &s;o that not ri|&s;ing

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>WE can ea&s;ily perceive that we are not far from <HI>Madrid,</HI>
the Weather is fair notwith&s;tanding the Sea&s;on, and we
have no more need of Fire; but it &s;eems very &s;trange to us,
that in the Inns which are the neare&s;t to this great Town, you
are wor&s;e u&s;ed than in tho&s;e which are an hundred Leagues
di&s;tant; you would think you came rather into <HI>De&s;arts,</HI> then
near a Town where re&s;ides &s;o great a <HI>Monarch:</HI> and I can
a&s;&s;ure you (dear Co&s;en) that in our whole Cour&s;e, I have not
met with an Hou&s;e or Ca&s;tle that has plea&s;ed me: I am much
amazed at it, for I thought that in this Country as in ours,
I &s;hould find fine Walks, and curious Seats, whereas you can
&s;carcely &s;ee any Trees, &s;ave &s;ome few which grow in &s;pight of
the Soil: And at this time, when I am but Ten Leagues from
<HI>Madrid,</HI> my Chamber &s;tands even with the Stable; it is an
Hole that needs a Light at Noon, but what kind of Light think
<PB N="108" REF="111">
you better have none at all, for this is a Lamp which bani&s;hes all
Chearfulne&s;s by its glimmering light, and your Health by its &s;tin|king
&s;cent: and go where you will, tho' to the Curate of the
Pari&s;h for a Candle, you will not find one, and I doubt much
whether there be any in his <HI>Church.</HI> Here every where a &s;ad
Scene of <HI>Poverty</HI> pre&s;ents it &s;elf to your &s;ight; <HI>Don Fernand de
Toledo,</HI> who took notice of my A&s;toni&s;hment, a&s;&s;ured me, I
&s;hould &s;ee very fine things at <HI>Madrid,</HI> but I could not forbear
telling him, I could not ea&s;ily imagine it: It is true, the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
bear up under their Indigency with &s;uch an Air of Gravity
as would cheat one, the very <HI>Pea&s;ants</HI> telling their &s;teps as they
walk, they are mighty inqui&s;itive after News, as if their whole
Being depended thereon; I have had many of them come into
my Chamber without any Ceremony, and without Cloaths on
their backs, or Shooes on their Feet, entreating me to tell them
what I knew of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> after I had &s;poke to them,
they have examined what I have &s;aid, and argued on it among
them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hewed great &s;en&s;e, and a lively
apprehen&s;ion: This Nation has ever had &s;omething extraordi|nary
among them above others.</P>
<P>There came to &s;ee me among others one of the Town&s;mens
Wives, a good likely Woman, &s;he carryed her Child in her
Arms, which was a dreadful lean one; he had above an hun|dred
little hands like tho&s;e of Joynted Babies hanging about his
Neck, and all &s;ides of him. I askt his Mother what this meant?
She an&s;wered me, this was good again&s;t <HI>Evil Eyes.</HI> How, &s;aid
I to her, do the&s;e little hands hinder one from any Di&s;temper of
the Eyes? Undoubtedly, replied &s;he, but not as you mean;
for you mu&s;t know if you plea&s;e, there are People in this Coun|try,
who have &s;uch a <HI>Poy&s;on</HI> in their <HI>Eyes,</HI> that in looking &s;ted|fa&s;tly
on a Per&s;on, and e&s;pecially on a young Child, they make
him pine away to death. I &s;aw a Man who had an <HI>Evil-Eye,</HI> and
doing mi&s;chief when he lookt with this Eye, he was obliged to
cover it with a great Plai&s;ter: As to the other <HI>Eye,</HI> it had no
<HI>Malignity,</HI> yet it &s;ometimes hapned that being with his Friends,
when he &s;aw a great many <HI>Fowls</HI> together, he would &s;ay, choo&s;e
which of the&s;e you would have me kill. He was &s;hewed one, he took
off his Plai&s;ter, lookt fixedly on the <HI>Fowl,</HI> and a while after &s;he
turned &s;everal times round as giddy, and tell down dead. This Wo|man
likewi&s;e would per&s;wade me there are <HI>Magicians,</HI> who look|ing
on any one with an <HI>Evil</HI> intention, &s;trikes them with &s;uch a
La$gui&s;hment, as makes them become lean like <HI>Skeletons,</HI> and her
Child, &s;he told me, has been &s;truck in this manner, and the common
Remedy is the&s;e <HI>little hands.</HI> Shemoreovertold me, it is the cu&s;tom,
<PB N="109" REF="112">
when they &s;ee any one look attentively upon them, and the
Party has a look ill enough to fear &s;he &s;hould give the <HI>Evil de
Ojos.</HI> (it is thus called, becau&s;e it is done by the Eyes) to pre|&s;ent
her one of the&s;e Hands, or even her own &s;hut, and to &s;ay
to her <HI>Toma la mano,</HI> which is to &s;ay, <HI>Take this hand;</HI> to which
the Party &s;u&s;pected mu&s;t an&s;wer, <HI>Dios le benediga, God ble&s;s you,</HI>
which if &s;he does not, &s;he is judged to be ill intentioned, and
thereupon he or &s;he may be denunciated to the inqui&s;ition, or
if you be the &s;tronger, you may beat them till they &s;ay <HI>Dios le
Benediga.</HI></P>
<P>I do not a&s;&s;ure you as a thing certain, that the Relation of
the <HI>Fowls</HI> is po&s;itively true; but this is certain, that they are
here &s;trongly per&s;waded there are Per&s;ons who can do you hurt
by <HI>bare looking on you,</HI> and here are even <HI>Churches</HI> to which they
go in <HI>Pilgrimage</HI> to be cured of it. I askt this young Woman
if there appeared nothing extraordinary in tho&s;e they call <HI>mi&s;|chievous
Eyes.</HI> She told me no, except that they are full of
&s;uch a &s;hining Vivacity, that they &s;eem to be all on fire, and
would make one think they will pierce you like a Dart. She
moreover told me, that of late the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> had cau&s;ed an Old
Woman to be &s;eized on, who was accu&s;ed to be a <HI>Witch,</HI> and &s;he
believed 'twas &s;he who had put her Child in that piteous condi|tion
I &s;aw it. I askt her what they would do to this Woman,
&s;he told me if there were Proofs &s;trong enough, &s;he would be
infallibly burnt, or left in the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> and that the be&s;t
treatment &s;he could choo&s;e would be to be delivered thence by
being whipt along the Streets. That the&s;e Witches are tied to
an A&s;&s;es Tail, or that they are placed on the&s;e Bea&s;ts coifed
with a Paper <HI>Mitre</HI> painted with all colours, with Writings
which denoted the Crimes they have committed: That in this
fine Equipage they are led about the Town, where every one
has the liberty to &s;trike them, or throw dirt at them. But, &s;aid
I to her, how know you their condition would be wor&s;e if they
remained &s;till in Pri&s;on? O <HI>Madam,</HI> &s;aid &s;he to me, I &s;ee you are
not yet informed what the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> is, whatever can be &s;aid
of it, comes not near the Rigourous exerci&s;es therein. You are
&s;eized on, and thrown into a Dungeon; you lye there two or
three Months, &s;ometimes more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s, without a
word being &s;aid to you; at the end of this time you are led
before the Judges, who with a terrible look ask you why you
are there? It is natural to an&s;wer, you know not. They
&s;ay no more to you, but &s;end you back again to this di&s;mal
Hole, wherein is every day &s;uffered a thou&s;and times more
<PB N="110" REF="113">
trouble than Death it &s;elf, yet you are not &s;uffered to dye there,
but remain many times a Year in this condition. At the end
of this time, you are brought again before the &s;ame Judges, or
before others, for they change, and go into &s;everal Countries,
the&s;e demand of you again, why you are detained? You An|&s;wer,
you have been Apprehended, but you know not for what.
You are &s;ent again into your Dungeon without any more words.
In &s;hort, &s;ometimes you pa&s;s over your whole Life there. And
demanding of her, if it were the Cu&s;tom for one to accu&s;e him|&s;elf,
&s;he an&s;wered, that as to &s;ome Per&s;ons, 'twas the be&s;t and
&s;horte&s;t way, but that the Judges held only this cour&s;e with tho&s;e
again&s;t whom they had no certain Proofs: for commonly, when a|ny
one accu&s;es a Per&s;on of Capital Crimes, the Accu&s;er was
wont to remain in Pri&s;on with the Criminal, and this is the rea|&s;on
of their being a little more moderate. She related to me
the particular puni&s;hments, and the wholemanner of them, with
which I will not fill this Letter, nothing being more dreadful.
She moreover told me, &s;he knew a <HI>Jew</HI> named <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> who
was put into the Pri&s;on of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> of <HI>Seville,</HI> with his
Father, who was a <HI>Rabbin</HI> of their Law. It is four years &s;ince
they were there, when <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> having made an hole, climbed
up to the top of a Tower, and making u&s;e of Ropes he had pro|vided,
he &s;lid down along the Wall with a great deal of danger,
but having got down, he reproached him&s;elf for having abando|ned
his Father, and without con&s;idering the Risk he had ran af|ter
more than one manner, &s;eeing his Father and he were con|demned,
and were to be led in a few days to <HI>Madrid</HI> with &s;eve|ral
others, to &s;uffer there the greate&s;t Torment, yet this hin|dred
him not from determining him&s;elf, he generou&s;ly climbed
up the Tower, de&s;cended into the Dungeon, drew thence his
Father, made him e&s;cape before him, and got away him&s;elf. I
found this Action very brave, and worthy to be &s;et as an Exam|ple
to <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in an Age wherein the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able Obli|gations
are &s;lighted. I continued entertaining my &s;elf with this
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Woman, when <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> one of my Women, whom you
know, came to tell&punc; me with earne&s;tne&s;s, that &s;he now &s;aw
<HI>Mon&s;ieur Daucort,</HI> and that if I would, &s;he would &s;tep out and
call him: This is a Rich Gentleman, whom I knew at <HI>Paris,</HI>
a civil Man, and of good Sen&s;e, and of comely Per&s;onage:
I knew that he had a Brother at <HI>Madrid</HI> belonging to <HI>Don Juan
of Au&s;tria.</HI> Having &s;hewed I &s;hould be glad to &s;peak with him,
<HI>Con&s;tance</HI> went out in que&s;t of him, and brought him to me.
After the fir&s;t Civilities, and informing my &s;elf of the News
<PB N="111" REF="114">
of my Kin&s;woman whom I believed he knew, I askt him of his
own Affairs, and whether he was content with his Journey. Ah,
<HI>Madam,</HI> &s;peak to me no more of my Journey, cryed he, there
was never a more unfortunate, and had you come &s;ome days
&s;ooner, you might have &s;een me hang'd. How &s;aid I to him,
what do you mean by this? I mean, &s;aid he to me, that I had
all the fear of it, and this is the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant Country in the
World for Strangers: But, Madam, if you are at lei&s;ure, and
would know more, I will relate to you my Adventure. It is
&s;ingular and will fully prove to you what I have told you. You
will do me a great deal of plea&s;ure, &s;aid I to him, we are here
in a place where &s;uch a Relation will much divert us, he began
it in this manner.</P>
<P>Some Affairs wherein I was concerned, and the De&s;ire of &s;ee|ing
a Brother whom I had been away from &s;ome years, obliged
me, Madam, to undertake this Journey to <HI>Madrid:</HI> I was little
acquainted with the Cu&s;toms of that place, I imagined one
might go to Women without difficulty, and that one might
play and eat with them; but I was a&s;toni&s;hed to learn, that e|very
one of them is more retired in her Hou&s;e, than a <HI>Carthu&s;ian</HI>
in his Cell, and that there are Per&s;ons who have been mutually
in Love for two or three years, and yet had never &s;poke to one
another. Such &s;ingular Manners &s;eemed ridiculous to me, I &s;aid
thereupon freely whatever came into my Head, but I treated
the matter more &s;eriou&s;ly, when I under&s;tood the&s;e Women
who were &s;o clo&s;ely confined, were the mo&s;t amiable Women
in the World, that they had &s;uch a Delicacy, Vivacity, and
Manners, as are no where to be met with but among them, that
Love always appeared new, that no one would change a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Woman but for another. I was in the greate&s;t de&s;pair at the
difficulties there were to get at them. One of my Friends,
named <HI>Belleville,</HI> who was my Companion in my Journey, and
who is a brisk Lad, was no le&s;s troubled on his &s;ide than I on
mine: My Brother, who feared le&s;t &s;ome Vexatious Accident
&s;hould befal us, continually inculcated into us how Jealous Hus|bands
are in this Country, great Murtherers, and no more va|lued
the killing of a Man than a Fly. This did not agree very
well with two Men who were not as yet weary of living.</P>
<P>We went into all parts where we thought we might &s;ee La|dies;
we &s;aw &s;ome in effect, but this did not &s;atisfie us, all the
bows and cringes we made them brought forth nothing, we each
of us returned home every Night very weary and di&s;gu&s;ted at
our fruitle&s;s Circuits.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="115">
One Night, <HI>Belleville</HI> and I went upon De&s;ign to the <HI>Prado,</HI>
which is a Walk adorned with great Trees, and &s;everal Foun|tains,
they throw their Water a great heighth, and in great
gu&s;hes it falls into Ba&s;ins, from whence it runs (when they have
a mind) into the Cour&s;es to Water them, and &s;o to make them
fre&s;h and plea&s;ant. It was the fine&s;t Weather this Evening
that one could wi&s;h. After we had light out of our Coach, and
&s;ent it away, we began to walk &s;oftly, and having made a few
turns, we &s;at us down on the &s;ide of one of the Fountains, and
then began to make our u&s;ual Complaints. Dear <HI>Belleville,</HI> &s;aid
I to my Friend, &s;hall we never be &s;o happy to meet with one of
the&s;e Witty and Charming <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women, &s;o much boa&s;ted
of? Alas! &s;ays he, I de&s;ire it too much, but dare not hope it:
Hitherto we have met with nothing but &s;uch ugly Creatures, as
run after Folks to fright them, and who under their white
$word$ are more Tauny and Loath&s;om than the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> &s;uch
as the&s;e, I &s;wear to you, do not plea&s;e me at all, and notwith|&s;tanding
their &s;prightfulne&s;s, I cannot con&s;ent to enter into a
near conver&s;ation with them.</P>
<P>At the very in&s;tant the&s;e words were out of his Mouth, we
&s;pyed coming out of a Door hard by, two Women; they had
left off their upper Garments, which were always very plain;
and when they opened their Manta's, the light of the Moon
made the glory of their Gold and Precious Stones appear. As
God's true, cries our <HI>Belleville,</HI> here's at lea&s;t two Fairies. Nay,
&s;aid I let's be ju&s;ter, and think them not other than two An|gels.
When they came near us, we &s;tood up, and made them
the lowe&s;t Bow that ever we did in our lives. They pa&s;t by us
&s;oftly, and with tho&s;e little Api&s;h Tricks, which become the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;o well, they lookt at us, fir&s;t with one Eye, and then
with to'ther. They went on a little; we were in pain what
to think, whether they would return back the &s;ame way, or
whether we &s;hould follow them, but while we were deliberating,
we perceived them to approach us, when they were near us,
they &s;tood &s;till, one of them began to &s;peak, and askt us, if we
could &s;peak <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI> I &s;ee by your Habits, &s;aid &s;he, that you
are &s;trangers. But I pray tell me of what Country are you?
We told her we were <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> and that we &s;poke <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> ill
enough, but we had a great mind to learn to &s;peak it well:
That to &s;ucceed therein, we were per&s;waded we mu&s;t love a
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Woman, and we heartily wi&s;hed we might find one that
de&s;ired to be beloved. The matter is nice replyed the other
$word$, which had not yet &s;poke, and I &s;hould be &s;orry for her
who engage$ in &s;uch a De&s;ign, for I have heard that <HI>Frenchmen</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="116">
are not Faithful. Oh! Madam, &s;ays <HI>Belleville,</HI> this was &s;ome
body which had a mind to do us an ill turn, and put us out of
your good opinion, but it will be ea&s;ie to wipe off this A&s;per|&s;ion.
Though I may &s;oon give my Heart to a pretty Woman,
yet I am very &s;en&s;ible I cannot &s;o ea&s;ily call it back again.
What! &s;ays &s;he that &s;poke to me before, dare you without fur|ther
con&s;ideration, enter into &s;uch an Engagement at fir&s;t &s;ight?
I &s;hould not have quite &s;o good an Opinion of you. Oh! Ma|dam,
cries he, why &s;hould we loo&s;e precious Time? If it is
good to love at all, it is good to begin as &s;oon as 'tis po&s;&s;ible:
Hearts that are born to Love, langui&s;h and decay when they
are not exerci&s;ed therein. Your Maxims are fine, replyed &s;he,
but they &s;eem dangerous, it is not only nece&s;&s;ary to avoid fol|lowing
of them, but even the hearing of them, and then in|deed
they would have been gone, but we begged them with great
earne&s;tne&s;s to tarry a few moments longer in the <HI>Prado.</HI> We
&s;aid all the pretty things to them both, which might oblige
them to di&s;cover them&s;elves, and give us the &s;atisfaction of
&s;eeing them without their Vails. Our Conver&s;ation was very
brisk, and plea&s;ant enough: they had abundance of Wit; and
as they knew how to manage all their Advantages, &s;o without
affectation, they &s;hewed us their Hands as they had an occa&s;ion
to mend the &s;itting of their Head-dre&s;&s;es, and they were whi|ter
than the Snow. In &s;pight of their &s;eeming care to hide
them&s;elves, yet we &s;aw enough to ob&s;erve their delicate Com|plexion,
their brisk Eyes, and their Features very regular. You
may be &s;ure we left them as late as we could, and that we con|jured
them to make that Walk Happy &s;ometimes with their Pre|&s;ence,
or el&s;e give us leave to wait on them at their Hou&s;e.
They agreed to nothing, and indeed, we were &s;everal times
after that at the <HI>Prado,</HI> and near that Fountain where we fir&s;t
&s;aw them, without being able to perceive them. Here's a deal
of time lo&s;t &s;aid we; what mu&s;t we do to pa&s;s our Lives in this
great want of Employment, for we mu&s;t renounce the thoughts
of Ladies, who&s;e Acce&s;s is &s;o difficult? This was our Re&s;oluti|on,
but it held not long, for &s;carcely had we made it, but we
&s;ee come out of the &s;ame Hou&s;e the two <HI>Incognito's.</HI> We drew
near them, full of Re&s;pect, and our civil Carriage did not di&s;|plea&s;e
them. <HI>Belleville</HI> took the lea&s;t by the hand, and I the
bigge&s;t. I endeavoured to per&s;wade her with what impati|ence
I expected her. I blamed her a little, at which &s;he &s;eemed
&s;omewhat concerned; but taking more courage, I di&s;cour&s;ed
to her of the thoughts &s;he had in&s;pired me with, and a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="114" REF="117">
her that it was in her power to engage me for my whole Life.
She &s;eemed extream careful not to give the lea&s;t mark of Fa|vour.
At length, among&s;t other things, &s;he told me, that &s;he
was Heire&s;s to a great E&s;tate, that her Name was <HI>Ines,</HI> that her
Father was a Knight of the Order of St. <HI>James,</HI> and was of
a con&s;iderable Quality, that &s;he which was with her was called
<HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and that they were Co&s;ens. All the&s;e particulars plea|&s;ed
me well, finding her a Per&s;on of Birth and therein my Vani|ty
flattered. At parting, I begged her to give me leave to
come to &s;ee her. What you de&s;ire of me, &s;ays &s;he, is the Cu|&s;tom
of your Country, and if I were there, I would plea&s;e my
&s;elf to ob&s;erve it, but we have different, and tho' I do not
conceive any Crime in what you ask me, yet I am obliged to
ob&s;erve certain Rules of Decency, which by no means I will
tran&s;gre&s;s. I will contrive &s;ome other way to &s;ee you, and of
this, depend upon me, and do not take it ill, that I refu&s;e you
a thing, which is not in my power to grant. Adieu, continu|ed
&s;he, I will think of what you de&s;ire, and will let you know
what I can do. I ki&s;t her Hand, and &s;o withdrew extreamly
touched with her way, as well as at her Wit and her prudence.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I was alone with <HI>Belleville,</HI> I askt him if he was
pleas'd with the Conver&s;ation he had enjoy'd. He an&s;wered me,
that he had a great cau&s;e to be &s;o, and that <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;eemed to
be of a Nature &s;weet and amiable. You are very happy, &s;aid
I already to have found &s;o much kindne&s;s. <HI>Ines</HI> gives me no
room to hope for any. She's of a gay Humour, and turns eve|ry
thing I &s;ay to her into Je&s;t, and I de&s;pair ever to make her
&s;erious. Some days pa&s;t, before we either &s;aw or heard from
them: But one Morning as I was at Ma&s;s, an Old Woman, hid
under a Vail, comes up to me, and pre&s;ents me a Billet in which
I read the&s;e words.</P>
<P>YOV appear too amiable to me to &s;ee you often, and I mu&s;t needs
confe&s;s to you, that I a little mi&s;tru&s;t my own Heart: If yours
is truly touched for me, Marriage mu&s;t be thought on. I have told
you that I am Rich, and I have told you the truth: That part which
I offer you, is not inconvenient to take: But con&s;ider of it, and in
the Evening I &s;hall be in the Banks of <HI>Man&s;anarez,</HI> where you may
let me know your thoughts.</P>
<P>As the place where I was did not allow me to write her an
An&s;wer, &s;o I contented my &s;elf to Note only on my Table-Book
the&s;e Lines:</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="118">
YO&V; have power to make me take what Journey you plea&s;e. I
am very &s;en&s;ible, that I Love you too well to be at ea&s;e, and
that I have more cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect my own Weakne&s;s, than you have
to be afraid of yours; however, I &s;hall be at <HI>Man&s;anarez,</HI> being re|&s;olved
to obey you, whatever you Command me.</P>
<P>I gave my Table-Book to this hone&s;t Me&s;&s;enger, which had
the looks tho', to &s;teal off the Plates and Cla&s;ps before &s;he would
deliver it. I de&s;ired <HI>Belleville</HI> to let me go alone to this A&s;|&s;ignation.
He told me, he was very glad of it, for <HI>I&s;abella</HI> had
given him Notice, that &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak with him alone at
the <HI>Florid.</HI> It was with impatience that we waited for the ap|pointed
hour, and then we quitted each other, after having
wi&s;hed our &s;elves good Succe&s;s in our Adventure.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I came to the River-&s;ide, I carefully lookt at all
the Coaches which pa&s;t by, but it was hard for me to di&s;cover
any thing, becau&s;e they had double Curtains drawn. But at la&s;t,
there came one and &s;topt, and I perceived &s;ome Woman in't,
who gave me a &s;ign to approach. There was <HI>Ines,</HI> who was
more concealed than u&s;ual, and I could not know her but by
her Voice. How indu&s;triou&s;ly you hide your &s;elf, &s;aid I to
her. Do you think, Madam, that the thoughts of not being
able to &s;ee you, and the violent de&s;ires I have for it are not
enough to kill me with Grief? If you'l come along with me,
&s;ays &s;he, you &s;hall &s;ee me. But for the pre&s;ent I mu&s;t hood|wink
you. To be free with you, &s;aid I to her, till now, you
have appeared very amiable to me; but this My&s;terious Car|riage,
which &s;erves to no end, but to make me &s;uffer, is trouble|&s;ome.
If I am &s;o unhappy to be thought by you an unfaithful
man, you ought not at all to tru&s;t me, but if on the contrary,
I am in your good Opinion, you ought to declare it, by a
more ingenuous proceeding. Interrupting me, &s;ays &s;he, you
ought to be per&s;waded, that I have &s;trong Rea&s;ons for what I
do, &s;ince notwith&s;tanding what you have now told me, I al|ter
not my Re&s;olution. The thing however is at your choice,
but for my own part, I will not let you come into my Coach,
but upon that Condition. As the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are naturally ob|&s;tinate,
I rather cho&s;e to &s;uffer my Eyes to be covered than to
break off with her. I mu&s;t needs own, that the&s;e appearances
of Good Fortune, had filled me with &s;ome &s;ort of Vanity, and I
fancyed my &s;elf with &s;ome Prince&s;s, which for the pre&s;ent had
no mind I &s;hould know her, but afterwards, that I &s;hould find
her, one of the mo&s;t perfect and rich Women of <HI>Spain.</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="119">
This conceit hindered me any longer to oppo&s;e her will. I
told her, I &s;ubmitted to her, to be hood-winked, and even to
be blinded by her, if &s;he could plea&s;e her &s;elf in the Action.
She tyed a Handkerchief about my Head &s;o hard, that at fir&s;t &s;he
put me in terrible pain: I &s;at me down by her, it was now dark,
I knew not whether we were going, but I gave my &s;elf up en|tirely
into her power.</P>
<P>She had with her two other Women, the Coach moved &s;o
long, that I believe we pa&s;&s;$$ through mo&s;t of the &s;treets of
<HI>Madrid.</HI> She entertained me with &s;uch witty Di&s;cour&s;e, that I
had no need to think the time or way long, and I was even
charmed with hearing her, when our unlucky Coach, which
was but a mean one, run upon another, and all on a &s;udden was
overturned. And we happened to fall in a place called the <HI>Maree,</HI>
which is one of the greate&s;t and na&s;tie&s;t Ditches in the City. I
was never &s;o vexed in my life; the three Ladies fell upon me,
they almo&s;t &s;tiried me, and I was even deaf with their noi&s;e.
Having my Eyes bound, and my Head turned about after a
&s;trange fa&s;hion, I could not have my &s;hare of making a noi&s;e,
without &s;wallowing a great deal of this &s;tinking Water. I then
began to make &s;ome Reflections on the unlucky hours of a
Man's Life; and though I dearly loved <HI>Ines,</HI> yet I found that
I loved my &s;elf more, and wi&s;hed I had never &s;een her. I can|not
po&s;itively tell how things pa&s;t, but I felt my &s;elf delivered
from that heavy weight which &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed me; and when,
by the help of &s;ome People which drew me out, I got upon my
leggs, I could neither &s;ee <HI>$nes</HI> nor her Companions. The Folks
which &s;tood about me, laughed like &s;o many Fools, to &s;ee me
hood-winked and &s;o covered with this black Water, that I looked
as if I had come out of an Ink-tub. I askt the Coach-man where
his Mi&s;tre&s;s was. He told me the Lady with whom I was, was
none of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and that &s;he went away cur&s;ing of me; that
&s;he was very dirty, that he knew her not, and that &s;he only
&s;aid to him at going away, that I mu&s;t pay him. And prithee
&s;aid I, where did&s;t thou take her up? He an&s;wered me, At the
Gate <HI>Delcalcas Reales,</HI> and that an Old Woman came for him,
and brought him to that place where he took her up. For my
Money I got him to carry me home. I expected <HI>Belleville</HI>
with a mixture of impatience and Grief: It was late before he
came, and he was extreamly &s;atisfied with <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> in whom he
found abundance of good Nature, and an infinite deal of Wit.</P>
<P>I related to him my Adventure, he could not but laugh
$artily a$$it; and as he was filled with an extraordinary Joy,
$he told me a hundred plea&s;ant Stories, which put me in|deed
<PB N="117" REF="120">
into a very bad Humour: It was day-light before we went
to Bed, and I had not got up, but to take a walk with him in
the <HI>Prado.</HI> As we were going along by &s;ome very low Win|dows,
I heard <HI>Ines</HI> cry out to me. <HI>Cavallero,</HI> go not &s;o fa&s;t,
it is at lea&s;t fit to ask you how you do after your fall la&s;t Night.
Advancing to the Window, pray, &s;aid I to her, what became of
you, fair <HI>Ines?</HI> And had not I misfortunes enough, but I mu&s;t
loo&s;e you too. You had not lo&s;t me, replyed &s;he, but that a
Lady, who was my Relation, pa&s;&s;ing by in that moment knew
my voice, and I was obliged again&s;t my mind, to go with her
in her Coach, for I was unwilling &s;he &s;hould &s;ee us together;
though the Coach-man told me another &s;tory, yet I dur&s;t not
examine any further into the matter, for fear of making her
unea&s;ie, and with abundance of kindne&s;s I askt her, when I
&s;hould have an Opportunity without any re&s;traint to let her
know what a mighty Pa&s;&s;ion and Re&s;pect I had for her. It
&s;hall be very quickly, &s;ays &s;he, for now I begin to think you love
me; but yet time mu&s;t confirm me in this Opinion. Oh!
you are very cruel, &s;aid I, and mu&s;t have very little Love for
me, thus to defer what I &s;o earne&s;tly beg. Speak the truth
freely, &s;ays &s;he, and tell me whether you will Marry me? Yes,
&s;aid I, if you will, I'll Marry you, notwith&s;tanding I never yet
had a full &s;ight of you, nor have had the happine&s;s to know you.
I am Rich, &s;ays &s;he, and am of Birth, and they tell me, I have
&s;ome Per&s;onal Merits. I replyed, You have all the things which
plea&s;e me, beyond any Per&s;on in the World: Your Wit hath
charmed me, but you make me often de&s;pair, and I had much
rather choo&s;e to dye at once, than &s;uffer what I do. She fell a
laughing, and after that, there were few Evenings that we did
not conver&s;e together, either at the <HI>Prado,</HI> or at <HI>Man&s;anarez,</HI> or
el&s;e at &s;ome Hou&s;e unknown to me, whither I was conducted. I
mu&s;t confe&s;s I never went into the Chamber with her, and I
only talkt to her through the Grates of the Window, where
for four hours together I u&s;ed to make the mo&s;t impertinent Fi|gure
in the World. To &s;peak freely, one mu&s;t live in <HI>Spain</HI> to
be able to endure &s;uch ways and Cu&s;toms; but yet really I loved
<HI>Ines;</HI> I ob&s;erved in her &s;omething that was very &s;mart and ta|king,
which &s;urprized and affected me.</P>
<P>One time I met her in a Garden, where &s;he had appointed
me to be, and where &s;he &s;hewed me more kindne&s;s than &s;he
u&s;ed to do. When &s;he &s;aw it begin to be dark, &s;he de&s;ired me
to be gone; I unwillingly obeyed her, and as I went along a
narrow Street, I perceived three Men with Sword in hand, &s;et
<PB N="118" REF="121">
upon one &s;ingle Man, who defended him&s;elf valiantly: I could
not endure to &s;ee &s;o unequal a Match, and I run to &s;econd him,
but ju&s;t as I came up to him, they made a pa&s;s at him, and he
fell upon me like a dead Man. The&s;e Murderers run away as
fa&s;t as they could, and by this time the noi&s;e had drawn out a
great many People, who &s;eeing me with my Sword in hand,
made no que&s;tion that I was one of the Criminals. They pre|pared
to &s;eize me, but perceiving their ill intentions, I thought
it was better to provide for my &s;afety by flight, than to tru&s;t
to my Innocence. I was clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, and which way &s;oe|ver
I took, &s;till they met with me. In this di&s;tre&s;s, I had a
glimp&s;e of a Door half open, I &s;lipt into it without any body's
&s;eeing me, and groping along. I came at la&s;t into a very dark
Hall, I perceived Light through a door, I could not tell whether
it was be&s;t to open it, nor what I &s;hould &s;ay, if there were
People in it. I con&s;idered with my &s;elf, that I had the looks
of one affrighted, and that I &s;hould be taken for a Man that came
from doing &s;ome ill Action, and &s;ought for an Opportunity to
do &s;ome other: I deliberated a long time, I li&s;tened with great
Attention to hear &s;ome body talk, and hearing none, at la&s;t I
ventured, and &s;oftly opened the Door, and &s;aw no body; I
nimbly looked about where to hide my &s;elf; methought the
Hangings &s;tuck out in &s;ome places, and really I got behind
them in a little corner: I had been there but a very little while,
when I e&s;pyed coming in, <HI>Ines</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> I cannot expre&s;s
to you, Madam, what a plea&s;ant Amazement I was in, to find
my &s;elf in my Mi&s;tre&s;s's Hou&s;e: I no ways doubted, that For|tune
favoured my De&s;ign; I was in no fear of tho&s;e who might
&s;earch after me, and as I was even ready to go and throw my
&s;elf down at her feet. I heard <HI>I&s;abella</HI> begin to Di&s;cour&s;e. Says
&s;he, What ha&s;t thou been doing to day, dear <HI>Ines,</HI> Ha&s;t thou
&s;een <HI>Daucourt?</HI> Yes, &s;ays <HI>Ines,</HI> I have &s;een him, and I have
rea&s;on to believe he loves me de&s;perately, unle&s;s all my Rules
deceive me; he talks very &s;eriou&s;ly of Marrying me, that which
perplexes me, is, that he will fir&s;t &s;ee and know me. And
how is it po&s;&s;ible for thee to deny either the one or the other?
replies <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> No, I do not pretend to do it, an&s;wers <HI>Ines,</HI>
only I'll take the mo&s;t favourable Opportunies, I fancy I &s;hall
not think it cunning to &s;et my &s;elf in a full light, and all the Cur|tains
open; no&punc; I intend they &s;hall be clo&s;e drawn, and that
the Windows &s;hall only let in &s;ome glimmering Rays of the Sun,
which &s;hall &s;erve to &s;et me off. As to my Birth, I have got my
Pedigree Authentically drawn, which co&s;t me nothing but a
<PB N="119" REF="122">
little Old Parchment gnawed by the Mice. And as to ready
Money, thou knowe&s;t my Old Lover, hone&s;t <HI>Don Diego,</HI> will
furni&s;h me, when <HI>Daucourt</HI> has told and received it, he will lit|tle
think, that Thieves appointed to take it away from him up|on
our very Wedding-Night: I have this day taken very fair
Lodgings ready Furni&s;hed, &s;o that thou wilt yield, I have neg|lected
nothing which might contribute to the &s;ucce&s;s of a bu&s;ine&s;s
&s;o advantagious to me, and which I &s;o much de&s;ire. Says <HI>I&s;a|bella,</HI>
thy precautions &s;eem very wi&s;e, but yet I fear the di&s;co|very
of the Intrigue. But &s;ays <HI>Ines,</HI> Prethee my Dear, what
do&s;t thou do? As to Marriage I make but a &s;mall Progre&s;s, &s;ays
<HI>I&s;abella,</HI> but to &s;peak truth that is not my De&s;ign: I find <HI>Bel|leville</HI>
an hone&s;t Man, I am &s;en&s;ible that I love him, I only
de&s;ire the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Heart, and I fancy, I &s;hould be &s;or|ry
if he would Marry me. Thou art of an odd &s;ort of Humour,
&s;ays <HI>Ines,</HI> thou love&s;t him, thy Fortune is none of the greate&s;t,
thou mighte&s;t be happy with him, and yet thou dur&s;t not de|&s;ire
to be his Wife. But Prethee, &s;ays <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> who told thee
that I &s;hould be happy with him? Love is &s;o uncon&s;tant a thing
that hardly are the fir&s;t moments of Marriage plea&s;ant; I tell
thee, Love mu&s;t have &s;omething continually to provoke and &s;pur
it. Novelty is a grateful Di&s;h to it, and how is it po&s;&s;ible for a
Wife always to be new? And how can a Mi&s;tre&s;s either, cries
<HI>Ines,</HI> be &s;o? Go, <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> thy Modi&s;h Maxims are not rea&s;ona|ble.
Neither, &s;ays <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> can I like of what thou de&s;igne&s;t,
and if thou would'&s;t take my Advice, thou &s;hould'&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly
con&s;ider thine own Age, for to &s;peak freely, thou art Old, very
Old: Is it ju&s;t for &s;ixty Years, to put a Cheat upon a Man of
thirty? He will be enraged at thee, he will certainly for&s;ake
thee, or el&s;e he'll break thy Bones, nay, it may happen he'll
knock thy Brains out before he leaves thee. <HI>Ines</HI> was of a
Quick Apprehen&s;ion and brisk; &s;he took it hainou&s;ly that <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI>
&s;hould reproach her with her Age, and immediately &s;he
gave her the greate&s;t box on the Ear which perhaps was ever
given. The other, of as ha&s;ty a Nature, returned her two,
<HI>Ines</HI> lent her a dozen good cuffs with her fi&s;t, which were &s;pee|dily
repaid: So that my two Female Champions entred the
Field of <HI>Mars.</HI> The Combat was &s;o extream plea&s;ant between
them, that I almo&s;t broke my&s;ides with laughing in my little Hole.
I had much ado to hinder my &s;elf from breaking out aloud, for you
may ea&s;ily believe, Madam, that I had very little concern for either
of them, after the Tr$$k which I under&s;tood was to be put upon
<PB N="120" REF="123">
me with &s;o much Malice, and when I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily look up|on
<HI>Ines</HI> as a common Jilt. <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> who knew all the weak
places of her Enemy, took her Opportunities, and being both
younger and &s;tronger, tore off her Head-dre&s;s, and left her all
bald. In my whole Life I was never more &s;urprized, than to
&s;ee the Hair fall off, which before appeared &s;o lovely to me, and
which I thought had been her own: But this was nothing to
what followed, for with one blow of her fi&s;t &s;he not only made
&s;everal of her Teeth leap out of her Mouth, but al&s;o two little
Cork plumpers, which &s;erved to fill out her hollow Jaws. And
here the Fray ended, for their Chamber-Maids, who had heard
the noi&s;e of the Skirmi&s;h, run in, and with much ado parted
them. They &s;aid the bittere&s;t things one again&s;t the other, and
even threatned to reveal to the inqui&s;ition mo&s;t terrible Crimes,
with which they reproached each other.</P>
<P><HI>Ines</HI> finding her &s;elf with her Chamber-maid only, looked at
her &s;elf a long time in a great Gla&s;s, and prote&s;ted that there
was nothing &s;o injurious, which &s;he had not &s;aid to <HI>I&s;abella,</HI>
that &s;he might be revenged of her for the Abu&s;es &s;he had re|ceived
from her: At la&s;t &s;he &s;at her down and re&s;ted her &s;elf a
while; a little Table was brought and &s;et before her, and upon
it &s;he lays an Artificial Eye, which u&s;ed to fill up the place of a
Natural one &s;he wanted; afterwards, &s;he takes off her Face as
much white and red Colour, as without any Hyperbole, would
have covered a Mask. It would be hard to de&s;cribe to you, Ma|dam,
the extraordinary ugline&s;s of this Woman, who till now,
had appeared to me very pretty. I rubbed my Eyes, I was like
a Man that could not tell whether he doted or had &s;ome idle
Dream. To be &s;hort, &s;he undre&s;t her &s;elf and was almo&s;t na|ked:
and here I &s;hall forbear repre&s;enting to you this frightful
Carca&s;s. But certainly, Love never met with a better Cure;
in all tho&s;e parts where other Folks are fat and plump, &s;he was
lean and hollow, &s;he lookt perfectly like a Skeleton, which by
&s;ome &s;ecret Spring was made to move about the Room: She
was in a Gown with a white Mantle upon her Shoulders, her
Head bald and her Arms appeared extream little and lean; &s;he
bethought her &s;elf, that in the Scuffle her Pearl Bracelets broke,
&s;he had a mind to gather them up, but had enough to do to
find them; her Chamber-maid came to help her, they counted
them, and found they had all but two which were well cur&s;ed
for my &s;ake: <HI>Ines</HI> &s;wore by St. <HI>James,</HI> Patron of <HI>Spain,</HI> that
&s;he would not go to Bed till &s;he had found them: Her Maid
and &s;he lookt in every corner and hole, removing the Tables,
<PB N="121" REF="124">
tumbling the Chairs, and throwing this way and that way eve|ry
thing they came near, for <HI>Ines</HI> was in a very ill Humour: As
I &s;aw her make towards my corner, fear of being di&s;covered by
&s;uch a Fury, made me lye as clo&s;e as 'twas po&s;&s;ible; but unluck|ily
as I drew back, I threw down &s;everal Bottles which &s;tood
there upon Shelves, and the&s;e made a mighty noi&s;e: <HI>Ines</HI> belie|ving
it was the Cat which had done this mi&s;chief, with all her
might cryed out, <HI>Gat$, Gat$,;</HI> that is Cat, Cat; and lifting up
the Hangings to cha&s;ti&s;e the Cat, with an amazement and rage
which almo&s;t &s;truck her dead upon the &s;pot, &s;he e&s;pyed me, &s;he
fell violently upon me, and pulled the Hair off my Head, &s;he
reviled me grievou&s;ly, &s;he was like one Frantick, the Veins of
her Neck were &s;o &s;welled, and her wrinkles and &s;urrows were
&s;o frightful, that methought I &s;aw the Head of <HI>Medu&s;a;</HI> and in
this my great Terror, I con&s;idered my e&s;cape, when on a &s;ud|den
I heard a &s;trange noi&s;e upon the Stairs which gave me a fre&s;h
Alarm: But <HI>Ines</HI> left me, and run down to know what was the
matter, and by that time, the whole Hou&s;e was filled with cries
and weeping: The Officers of Ju&s;tice, who had found this
Young Man (of whom I told you before, Madam) lying
upon the Ground, and was the cau&s;e I was &s;o hotly pur&s;ued, after
&s;ome diligent &s;earch, found that he was the Son of a Lady who
lived in the &s;ame Hou&s;e, they brought him thus with his Body all
wounded and bloody, at which &s;ad &s;ight &s;he fell into a de&s;perate
condition. And as I had told <HI>Ines</HI> &s;omething of my Adventure,
that I might give her &s;ome &s;atisfaction why I came into her Cham|ber,
&s;o this lean Hag, would not keep my Secret, but to be re|venged
on me for having di&s;covered her crafty tricks, was re|&s;olved
to inform again&s;t me. I have the Murderer in my pow|er,
cries &s;he, come along with me, and I'll deliver him up to
you. Immediately &s;he opens her Chamber-door, and being
followed by a Troop of <HI>Alquazils,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Serjeants or
Bayliffs, delivered me up to them with all the nece&s;&s;ary Evi|dence
for my &s;peedy Tryal. Says &s;he, I &s;aw this wretch with
his naked Sword all bloody with the wound he came from giv|ing;
he ran into my Chamber to &s;ave him&s;elf, and threatned
me with Death if I would not conceal him. Whatever I
could &s;ay in my Ju&s;tification was all in vain, they would not &s;o
much as hear me; they bound my Hands with Cords, and &s;o
led me to Pri&s;on as a wretched Malefactor, whil&s;t good <HI>Ines,</HI>
and the Mother and Si&s;ter of the wounded, loaded me with
blows and cur&s;es; they cau&s;ed me to be put in a Hole, where
I was &s;everal days without having the liberty to give notice to
<PB N="122" REF="125">
my Brother or my Friends of what has pa&s;t, they likewi&s;e were
in mighty pain about me, concluding for certain, that I was
murdered in &s;ome corner of a Street, or el&s;e at &s;ome of my Night-|Intrigues.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, <HI>Belleville,</HI> who &s;till continued to &s;ee <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> acquain|ted
her with his grief, and begged her to a&s;&s;i&s;t him to di&s;cover
at lea&s;t, what they had done with my Body: She was &s;o indu|&s;trious
to get information about it, that <HI>Ines</HI> Chambermaid, who
had been ill enough u&s;ed by her Mi&s;tre&s;s, told her the whole
Secret of the Hi&s;tory, altho' her good Lady had &s;trictly forbid
her. Upon this News, my Brother ran to beg the King to have
pity on me, and to command them to remove me out of that
hole, which &s;eemed more like Hell than a Pri&s;on: I &s;wooned
away when I &s;aw light: I was &s;o wa&s;ted and weak that I fright|ed
folks, but yet I could not come out of Pri&s;on for &s;ome time,
becau&s;e of certain Formalities, and I leave you to think, Madam,
what I meditated again&s;t the perfidious <HI>Ines,</HI> but yet I know
not whether ever I &s;hould be in a condition to put in execution
all the Projects of my ju&s;t Revenge, for the Gentleman, who
was wounded, continued very ill, and his Life was de&s;paired of,
mine depended upon &s;uch a tickli&s;h point, that I put up mo&s;t
ardent Prayers for him, and in &s;uch a melancholy uncertainty,
I pa&s;t a great many hours. But my Brother, who was per&s;wa|ded
of my Innocence, omitted nothing for the di&s;covery of the
Authors of this Murderous Act. At la&s;t, he under&s;tood that
this young and wounded <HI>Cavallero</HI> had a Rival, and he made &s;o
diligent a Search and Examination, that he certainly new that
the Blow came from thence, he was &s;o fortunate to get him ap|prehended,
and this Man freely owned the Fact, which acquit|ted
me. I was therefore &s;et at Liberty, and I conceived &s;o much
Joy at it, that I was &s;ick for &s;everal days after, or rather per|haps,
it was an effect of that unwhol&s;ome Air which I received
in the Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>In the mean while, wicked <HI>Ines,</HI> who to be &s;ure was not much
at ea&s;e, for fear of what might happen upon her &s;erving me &s;uch
a plea&s;ant Trick, having notice that I was &s;et free, and in a condi|tion
to Reward her according to her Merits, packed up her Bag|gage,
and one Night privately runs away, and no body knew
whither &s;he was gone, &s;o that when we wanted her, at lea&s;t to
make her an Example among the cheating <HI>Jilts,</HI> we were di&s;|appointed.
But I was ea&s;ily &s;atisfied, becau&s;e naturally I do not
love to do any hurt to Women. But le&s;t &s;he might play me
&s;ome other pranks, I left <HI>Madrid,</HI> that I might al&s;o avoid tho&s;e
of <HI>Spain.</HI> I am now returning into <HI>France,</HI> Madam, continued
<PB N="123" REF="126">
he, whither I &s;hall be very glad to carry your Commands, if
you'll do me &s;o great an Honour to lay any upon me.</P>
<P>Though I have &s;ome trouble at what happened to this Gentle|man,
yet I could not chu&s;e but laugh at &s;ome Circum&s;tances of
this Adventure, and I am willing to believe, Dear Co&s;en, that
you will not be di&s;plea&s;ed, that I make you partake with me. I
&s;hall write to you no more till I come to <HI>Madrid,</HI> where I pro|mi&s;e
my &s;elf to &s;ee things far more worthy of your Notice, than
hitherto I have been able to acquaint you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>I Would not, if you plea&s;e, Dear Co&s;en, have you angry,
that I did not write to you as &s;oon as I arrived at <HI>Madrid:</HI>
I thought it was better to tarry till I was in a condition to tell
you &s;omething more exactly and curious. I knew that my
Kin&s;women was to go before me, as far as <HI>Alcouendus,</HI> which
is about &s;ix Leagues di&s;tance from <HI>Madrid.</HI> As &s;he was not yet
come, and I had a mind to &s;tay for her, <HI>Don Frederic de Car|donne</HI>
propo&s;ed to me to go Dine at a very fine Hou&s;e, the
Ma&s;ter whereof was his particular Acquaintance; So that in|&s;tead
of going into this little Village, we cro&s;&s;ed by it, and
through a Walk plea&s;ant enough, we came to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Don
Augu&s;tin Pacheco.</HI> This Gentleman is ancient, and yet he is
lately marryed to <HI>Donna Thore&s;a de Figucroa.</HI> This is his Third
Wife, and &s;he is but Seventeen Years of Age; but of &s;uch an
agreeable Humour, and &s;o ingenious, that we were perfectly
Charmed with her Wit and her Per&s;on: It was then Ten a
Clock when we got there. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are naturally Lazy,
and love to ri&s;e late; and the&s;e Two were yet in Bed. Her
Husband gave us &s;uch a frank and civil Reception, as &s;uffici|ently
te&s;tified how much he was plea&s;ed that we came to &s;ee
him. He went to walk in his Gardens, who&s;e Exactne&s;s yields
in nothing to ours. I accompanied him without delay; for
the Weather was very inviting, and the Trees in this Country
are as forward in the Month of <HI>March,</HI> as they are in <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="124" REF="127">
at the latter end of <HI>June.</HI> Indeed this is the mo&s;t Charming
Sea&s;on for the enjoyment of what they call <HI>La Prima Vera,</HI>
that is to &s;ay, the Beginning of the Spring: For when the
Sun begins to have more Force and Heat, it &s;corches and wi|thers
the Leaves, as if they had pa&s;&s;ed through Flames. The&s;e
Gardens of which I &s;peak, were adorned with Bowling-Greens,
Fountains and Statues, and <HI>Don Augu&s;tin</HI> was not backward to
&s;hew us all the Rarities. He is much taken with them, and
values not &s;pending Money thereon; for he is very rich. He
led us into a Gallery, where there were divers Tables of Ce|dar
Wood, &s;et full of Books. He immediately led us up to
the Bigge&s;t of them, and told us, they contained an ne&s;tima|ble
Trea&s;ure, and that there was a Collection of Plays of the be&s;t
Authors: Heretofore, <HI>continued he,</HI> Vertuous per&s;ons could not
think fit to go to Plays; there was nothing to be &s;een but
Actions contrary to Mode&s;ty; they heard Di&s;cour&s;es which
were offen&s;ive; the Actors made hone&s;t People a&s;hamed, there
Vice was flattered, and Vertue condemned; the Scenes became
bloody with Combats, the weake&s;t was always oppre&s;t by the
&s;tronge&s;t, and Cu&s;tom gave continuance to Crimes. But &s;ince
<HI>Lopes de Vega</HI> hath &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully laboured to reform the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Theatre, there is now nothing &s;uffered contrary to good Man|ners:
Both the Favourite, the Footman, and the Ploughman, with|out
di&s;gui&s;e, keeping to their Native Simplicity, and making that
plea&s;ant by an ingenuous turn, find the Secrets to cure Princes,
and even our Kings, of that common Di&s;ea&s;e to hear Truth, when
their own Faults are repre&s;ented. It was he who gave Rules
for the&s;e A&s;cents, and who taught them to divide their Plays
into Three <HI>Jordana</HI>'s, or Acts. Since his time, we have &s;een
flouri&s;h the <HI>Montalvanes,</HI> the <HI>Mendoza'n,</HI> the <HI>Rojas Alarcones,</HI>
the <HI>Veles,</HI> the <HI>Mira de Me&s;cuas,</HI> the <HI>Coellos,</HI> and the <HI>Villaizanes.</HI>
But above all, <HI>Don Pedro Calderonne</HI> excelled as to the Serious
and Grave Part, and even in the Comick Part he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed
all tho&s;e that went before him. I could not forbear telling him,
That at <HI>Victoria</HI> I &s;aw a Play, which to me &s;eemed bad enough:
And if I might &s;peak my Judgment freely, I would not have
them intermixt with <HI>Holy Tragedies</HI> (which require great Re|&s;pect,
and according to their Subjects &s;hould be worthily ma|naged)
any idle or &s;illy Je&s;ts. He replyed, That by this I had
&s;aid to him, he knew the Genius of my Country; that he
had &s;eldom ob&s;erved the <HI>French</HI> to like what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did,
and as this Thought carryed him to &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ing Reflections,
I a&s;&s;ured him, That Naturally we have no Antipathy for any
Nation; That we even thought our &s;elves obliged to do Ju&s;tice
<PB N="125" REF="128">
to our Enemies. And as to plays, though I had yet found
none to my Fancy, it did not follow but that there might be o|thers
much better and more agreeable to me. The manner of
my talking to him did a little compo&s;e him; &s;o that he de&s;ired
me to go into his Wifes Apartment, which was at the end of
the Gallery.</P>
<P><HI>Don Fernand de Toledo,</HI> and the three other Knights, tarryed
there, becau&s;e it is not the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Spain</HI> for Men to go in|to
Womens Chambers while they are in Bed. A Brother has
not this Priviledge unle&s;s his Si&s;ter be &s;ick. <HI>Donna There&s;a</HI> re|ceived
me in as kind and obliging a manner, as if we had been
long acquainted. And this mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, in prai&s;e of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> that nothing of that &s;ort of Familiarity which comes
from want of, or a mean Education, appears in their En|tertainments;
for with great Civility and Earne&s;tne&s;s they are
very careful to pay what they owe to others, and at the &s;ame
time do not forget what's due to them&s;elves. She was in Bed
without any Coife or Cornet; her Hair was parted in the mid|dle
of her Forehead tyed behind with a Ribbon, and wrapt up
with Carnation coloured Taffety. Her Shift was very fine, and
of &s;o va&s;t a largene&s;s, that it lookt like a Surplice, the Sleeves
were as big as Mens, and buttoned at the Hands with Diamonds.
In&s;tead of narrow Point at the Neck and Hands, &s;he had hers
wrought with Blue and Fle&s;h coloured Silk in Flowers; her
Ruffles were of White Taffety Pinkt.&mdash;She had &s;everal lit|tle
Pillows tyed with Ribbons, and trimed with very broad
and fine Lace; &s;he had Ba&s;&s;es all of Flowers of Point <HI>de Spain</HI>
in Silk and Gold, which lookt very pretty? Her Bed was all of
Copper, Guilt with little Balls of Ivory and Ebony; her Bed-|Head
was adorned with four Rows of little Copper Balli&s;ters,
very well wrought.</P>
<P>She asked me leave to ri&s;e, but when &s;he came to put on her
Stockings and Shooes, &s;he cau&s;ed the Key to be taken out of the
Door, and that to be bolted. I enquired the Rea&s;on of this
Barricading: She told me, That &s;he knew there was with me
&s;ome <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, and that &s;he had rather lo&s;e her Life
than they &s;hould &s;ee her Feet. I broke out into Laughter, and
begged her to let me &s;ee them; for that I could not apprehend
that the thing was of that moment. It is true indeed, that for
their Littlene&s;s they are &s;omething extraordinary; for I have
&s;een Children of &s;ix Years old have as great. As &s;oon as &s;he
was up, &s;he took a little Cup full of <HI>Red,</HI> and with a good big
Pencil &s;he laid it on, not only upon her Cheecks, her Chin&punc; un|der
her No&s;e, above her Eye-brows, and the Edges of her E$s;
<PB N="126" REF="129">
but &s;he al&s;o bedaubed the in&s;ide of her Hands, her Fingers, and
her Shoulders. She told me that every Night at going to Bed,
and every Morning at ri&s;ing, they laid this Colour on; That
&s;he did not paint, and that &s;he was willing enough to leave the
u&s;e of this <HI>Red,</HI> but that it was &s;uch a General Cu&s;tom, that it
could not be di&s;penced with, for let one be of never &s;o fre&s;h
a Colour, they would look pale and &s;ickly when they were near
others, if they did not u&s;e this <HI>Red.</HI> One of her Women per|fumed
her from Head to Foot, with excellent Pa&s;trils, the
Smoak whereof &s;he made to a&s;cend to her, another took O|range
Flower-Water in her Mouth, and dexterou&s;ly through
her Teeth &s;he &s;prinkled it like Rain upon her; and this they
call <HI>Rou&s;&s;ia.</HI> She told me, That there was nothing that &s;poiled
the Teeth more than this was of &s;quirting it, but that the Wa|ter
&s;melt better for it. Of this I doubted, and I thought it ve|ry
ugly, that an Old Woman &s;uch as that was which I &s;aw there,
&s;hould come and &s;purt Water out of her Mouth, in my Face.</P>
<P><HI>Don Augu&s;tin</HI> having known by one of his Wife's Servants,
that &s;he was dre&s;t, did not &s;tand upon the Cu&s;tom of the
Countrey, but lead <HI>Don Fernand,</HI> and the Knights into her
Chamber. The Conver&s;ation was not long in common, but we
divided; for my part, I di&s;cour&s;ed with <HI>Donna There&s;a,</HI> and &s;he
told me, &s;he was born at <HI>Madrid,</HI> but was brought up at <HI>Lisbon</HI>
with her Grand-mother, who was Si&s;ter to <HI>Don Augu&s;tin Pache|co,</HI>
&s;o that her Husband was her great Uncle, and the&s;e &s;ort of
Alliances are often contracted in <HI>Spain.</HI> She talkt to me much
of the Young <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and boa&s;ted mightily of
her Wit, and told me&punc; if I would go into her Clo&s;et, I might
judge of her Beauty, for &s;he had her Picture there. I immedi|ately
went, and was &s;urprized with the Charms I ob&s;erved in
this Prince&s;s. She had her Hair cut and curled like the Peri|wig
of an Abbot, and an Invention for pre&s;erving Children
from falling, &s;o big, that there were upon it&punc; Two Baskets of
Flowers, and little Ve&s;&s;els of a Medicinal Earth, of which they
eat a great deal in <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> although 'tis an Earth
that hath little Ta&s;te. <HI>Donna There&s;a</HI> &s;hewed me the Skin of a
Serpent, which her Husband killed in the <HI>Indies;</HI> and though
it was dead, yet I was afraid of it. Tho&s;e of this kind are ex|tream
dangerous; but it &s;eems as if Providence had taken care
to pre&s;erve Men from them, for the&s;e Serpents have a &s;ort of
Bell about their Head, which rings when they move, and &s;o
gives notice to Travellers to &s;ecure them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="130">
This young Lady, who is a great Lover of <HI>Portugal,</HI> di&s;cour|&s;ed
to me much in its Favour: She told me, That the Sea,
which flows up into the <HI>Tagus,</HI> renders that River capable to
bear the greate&s;t Gallions, and the faire&s;t Ships upon the Ocean.
That the City of <HI>Lisbon</HI> &s;tands upon the &s;ide of a little Hill, which
in&s;en&s;ibly de&s;cends to the very Brink of the <HI>Tagus:</HI> So that the
Hou&s;es being built one above another, are all &s;een at once, and
&s;o becomes a very plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect. The old Walls which the
<HI>Moors</HI> built about it, are yet &s;tanding: There are of them four
Rounds, built at divers times; the la&s;t may have about &s;ix
Leagues Circumference. The Ca&s;tle, which &s;tands upon a Hill,
hath its particular Beauties: In it you &s;ee <HI>Palaces, Churches,
Fortifications, Gardens, Armories and Streets:</HI> There's always a
good Garri&s;on with a Governour: This Fortre&s;s commands the
City, and from thence they may thunder upon it, in ca&s;e it
proves rebellious. The Palace where the <HI>King</HI> lives, is more con|&s;iderable,
if not for its Strength, yet for the Uniformity of its
Buildings: Every thing there is Great and Magnificent, the
Pro&s;pect it has to the Sea hath made them take &s;o much care
to beautify it. She di&s;cour&s;ed to me afterwards of the Publick
Places, which are adorned with Vaults and Arches, and of the
great Hou&s;es round about the <HI>Dominicans</HI> Convent, where the
<HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> is, before the Gate of which there is a Fountain, with
a great many Statues of White Marble, which throw the Wa|ter
every way. She added, That the Fair of <HI>Reucio</HI> is kept on
the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> of every Week, in a Place which might be taken
for an <HI>Amphitheatre,</HI> becau&s;e 'tis environed with little Hills,
upon which are built &s;everal fair Palaces. There's another Place
on the &s;ide of the <HI>Tagus,</HI> where the Market is kept, and there
one may meet with every thing which can be de&s;ired, of the
be&s;t in his kind, either in Fowl, Fi&s;h, Fruits, Herbs or Pul&s;e.
The <HI>Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e</HI> &s;tands a little higher up, where there is infi|nite
Riches and Rarities, and &s;ome Fortifications are lately made
to pre&s;erve them. The Metropolitan Church is not eminent
for any thing but its Antiquity: It is dedicated to St. <HI>Vincent,</HI>
it is pretended that after he had &s;uffered Martyrdom, they re|fu&s;ed
him Burial, and that the Ravens watcht over his Body, till
&s;ome pious Per&s;ons came and took it up, and carried it to <HI>Valen|tia</HI>
in <HI>Spain,</HI> to have it wor&s;hipt, and for this Rea&s;on there are
Ravens kept in the Church, and there is a Box for them, into
which are are put the Alms to buy them Food.</P>
<P>Although <HI>Lisbon, continued &s;he,</HI> is a very plea&s;ant place to live
in, yet we dwelt at <HI>Alcantara:</HI> This Village is not above a
<PB N="128" REF="131">
quarter of a League from the City: There's in it a <HI>Royal</HI> Hou&s;e
not &s;o fine for its Buildings, as for its Situation; the River &s;up|plies
the place of a Channel: There one &s;ees admirable Gar|dens,
all filled with Gro$ts and Cataracts, or great Falls of Wa|ter,
as well as Spouts of Water. <HI>Belem</HI> is not far from hence:
it is the place de&s;igned for the <HI>Sepulture</HI> of the Kings of <HI>Portu|gal,</HI>
in the Church of the <HI>Hieronomites:</HI> it is all covered over
with White Marble; the Pillars and Statues are of the &s;ame; the
Tombs are in even Rows in three different Chappels, among&s;t
which there are &s;ome well wrought. <HI>Belem, Feriera, Sacavin,</HI>
and &s;ome other places about the City, are remarkable for the
va&s;t quantities of Oranges and Lemons growing there; the Air
you &s;mell there is all perfumed; you can hardly &s;it down under
the Trees, but you are covered with their Flowers, one &s;ees
running among&s;t them a Thou&s;and little Rivulets, and it may
be affirmed, that there is nothing more &s;weet in the Night,
than the Murmurs and Harmony which are there frequently
heard. At <HI>Belem</HI> there are great Magazines of Oranges, both
&s;weet and four Lemmons, Pom-Citrons and Lemmons. They
load them on &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;o tran&s;port them into mo&s;t
parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Likewi&s;e &s;he told me of the Knights <HI>del Habito de Chri&s;to, of
the Habit of Chri&s;t,</HI> who&s;e multitude made them le&s;s con&s;idera|ble,
and al&s;o of the <HI>Counts</HI> of the Kingdom, which have the
&s;ame Priviledges as the <HI>Grandees of Spain;</HI> they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
<HI>Las Comarcas,</HI> which are certain Lands belonging to the Crown,
and divided into Counties of a con&s;iderable Value. She told
me, that when the <HI>King</HI> intended to go abroad, the People
had notice of it by a Trumpet, which &s;ounds very early in the
Morning in the place through which his Maje&s;ty is to pa&s;s.
For the <HI>Queen,</HI> 'tis a Flute and a Drum; for the <HI>Infanta,</HI> a
Hautboy. When they all go abroad together, the Trumpet, the
Drum, the Flute, and the Hautboy, march in a Company, and
by this means, if any one which cannot get into the <HI>Palace</HI> to
pre&s;ent a Petition, he need only wait for the King's coming by.
Eight Leagues from <HI>Coimbri$,</HI> there's a Fountain in a place cal|led
<HI>Cedima,</HI> which draws in, and &s;wallows down every thing
which touches its Water. Experiments are often made from
great branches of Trees, and &s;ometimes of Hor&s;es, which they
cau&s;e to be brought there, from whence they cannot get back,
but with great difficulty.</P>
<P>But that which cau&s;es the greate&s;t wonder, added &s;he, is the
<HI>Lake</HI> of the Mountain of <HI>Strella,</HI> where there are often found
the Wrecks of Ships, broken Ma&s;ts, Anchors, and Sails, and yet
<PB N="129" REF="132">
the Sea is above twelve Leagues off, and this is upon the top
of a very high Hill too, it cannot be imagined by what means
all the&s;e things &s;hould come there. Whil&s;t I was hearing with
great delight <HI>Donna There&s;a</HI> relate the&s;e things, her Husband
and the re&s;t of the Company came and interrupted us. <HI>Don
Augu&s;tin</HI> was a Man of Under&s;tanding, and for all his Age, was
very plea&s;ant. If my Curio&s;ity is not indi&s;creet, pray Madam,
&s;ays he, tell me, what Subject this Child has entertained you
with? <HI>Mi Tio,</HI> replied &s;he, that is my Uncle, you may ea&s;ily
believe it was <HI>Portugal?</HI> Oh! I thought as much, cryed he;
There it is &s;he always cho&s;es her Field of Action. Dear <HI>God,</HI>
&s;ays &s;he, every body has &s;ome place they love, and when once
you are got to your <HI>Mexico,</HI> one cannot draw you from thence.
You have been in the <HI>Indies,</HI> re&s;umed I, and <HI>Donna There&s;a</HI> hath
&s;hewed me a Serpent, which &s;he &s;ays you killed there. It is
true, Madam, continued he, and if it were not time for you
to Dine, it would not, it may be, be unplea&s;ant to you to hear
of what I have &s;een there. But, &s;ays he, I &s;hould go to <HI>Ma|drid,</HI>
and if you plea&s;e I'll bring to you <HI>Donna There&s;a:</HI> It is
there indeed, where I &s;hould lay the Scene of Di&s;cour&s;e, and
where I could tell you of things which I believe you would not
be unwilling to know. I a&s;&s;ured him, that he would do me a
particular favour to give me &s;o &s;ignal a mark of his kindne&s;s;
and that I &s;hould be over joyed to &s;ee the fair <HI>Donna There&s;a,</HI>
and to hear her talk of the <HI>Indies,</HI> &s;he that di&s;cour&s;ed &s;o admi|rably
of every thing. He took me by the Hand and led me
down into a Hall pa$ed with Marble, which was hung with
Pictures in&s;tead of Tapi&s;try, and &s;et round with Cu&s;hions.
Cloth was laid there upon a Table for the Men, but upon a Car|pet
on the Floor, it was laid for <HI>Donna There&s;a,</HI> my &s;elf, and my
Daughter.</P>
<P>I was &s;urprized at this Fa&s;hion, not having been u&s;ed to Dine
&s;o; however I took no notice of it, and I had a mind to try it,
but I was never more unea&s;ie; my Leggs aked mo&s;t horribly:
one while I leaned upon my Elbow, and then upon my Hand:
In a word, I could not Dine, and yet the good Lady was not
&s;en&s;ible of it, for &s;he thought the Women in <HI>France</HI> were u&s;ed
to eat upon a Floor, as they did in <HI>Spain.</HI> But <HI>Don Fernand
de Toledo,</HI> who ob&s;erved me unea&s;ie, ro&s;e from Table with <HI>Don
Frederic de Cardonna,</HI> and both of them told me, that ab&s;olute|ly
I &s;hould &s;it with them. I was willing enough, provided <HI>Don|na
There&s;a</HI> would do &s;o too; but &s;he dur&s;t not, becau&s;e there
were Men, upon whom &s;he did not &s;o much as lift up her Eyes
but by &s;tealth. <HI>Don Augu&s;tin</HI> bid her come without Ceremony
<PB N="130" REF="133">
and told her, that they mu&s;t let me know, that they were glad
to &s;ee me at their Hou&s;e. But that which was very plea&s;ant,
was when this Lady was &s;et upon a Chair, &s;he was no le&s;s at
ea&s;e, then I was when I &s;at upon the Carpet, &s;he prote&s;ted
with a pretty &s;ort of freedom, that &s;he never before &s;at in a
Chair, and that &s;he had never once thought on't. Thus we
dined very merrily, and there was nothing which could be ad|ded
to the obliging manner of my Reception in this Hou&s;e. I
gave to <HI>Donna There&s;a</HI> &s;ome Ribbons, Pins, and a Fan. She was
mightily plea&s;ed, and gave me as many thanks, as if the Pre&s;ent
had been of value. Here thanks were not common, one could
not ob&s;erve in them any thing that was low or covetous. And
to &s;peak truth, they have abundance of Wit and Sen&s;e in this
Country, it appears even in the &s;malle&s;t trifles.</P>
<P>I had not been gone an hour from this Hou&s;e, when I &s;aw
coming towards us two Coaches drawn by &s;ix Mules apiece,
which galloped a great pace, and fa&s;ter than the be&s;t Hor&s;es could
do. I could hardly have believed that Mules could run &s;o fa&s;t.
But that which I wondred mo&s;t at, was the manner of their
being harna&s;&s;ed. The&s;e two Coaches and their Furniture took up
almo&s;t a quarter of a League of room. There was one with
&s;ix Gla&s;&s;es indifferent large, and made like ours, except that
the upper part is very low, and &s;o Inconvenient. Within it
had a Corni&s;h or Wood gilt but &s;o large, that it lookt like one
for a Chamber. The Coach was guilt on the out-&s;ide, which is
only allowed to Emba&s;&s;adors and Strangers. The Curtains were
of Damask and Cloth &s;ewed together. The Coach-man rode
upon one of the four Mules, they do not &s;it in the Coach-box,
although there is one; and upon my asking the Rea&s;on of it,
<HI>Don Frederick de Cardonne</HI> told me, that he had been a&s;&s;ured,
that this Cu&s;tom had been ever &s;ince the Coach man of the
Lord Duke <HI>De Olivares</HI> drove his Ma&s;ter, who over-hearing
&s;omething of great importance which the Duke told to one of
his Friends, revealed it, the matter having made a great noi&s;e
at Court, (for it &s;eems the Duke accu&s;ed his Friend of &s;ome in|di&s;cretion,
which neverthele&s;s he was innocent of) ever &s;ince,
they have been &s;o cautious to make the Coachman ride upon the
fir&s;t Mule. Their Traces are &s;ilk and Hempen Cords, &s;o exce&s;|&s;ive
long, that from one Mule to another, there's above three
Ells di&s;tance, and I cannot under&s;tand, but every thing &s;hould
break at the rate they run. It is true, that though they run
very fa&s;t in the Country, yet they go very &s;oftly in the City, and
'tis a tire&s;ome thing to go &s;o &s;lowly as if they told their &s;teps.
And though at <HI>Madrid</HI> they have but four Mules, yet they have
<PB N="131" REF="134">
a Po&s;tilion. My Relation was in the fir&s;t of the&s;e Coaches, with
three <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies. The Gentlemen and the Pages were in
the other, which was not made after the &s;ame manner. It had
Boots, as formerly our Coaches had, they are to let down, and
the $eather is open at bottom, &s;o that when the Women come
out (if they have no mind their Feet &s;hould be &s;een) the Boot
is let down to the ground to hide their Shooes. It had Gla&s;&s;es
twice as big as my hand, made fa&s;t to each end of the Coach,
for the conveniency of calling to the Footmen. Nothing
more re&s;embles our Garret-windows than the$$ do. The top
of the Coach is covered with Gray <HI>Parragon,</HI> and the Curtains
are of the &s;ame, large and long, hang without and draw round,
and are fa&s;tned with Buttons and Loops: This looks very ill,
and you are inclo&s;ed within as if you were in a Box.</P>
<P>My Relation was dre&s;t, half <HI>French</HI> and half <HI>Spani&s;h:</HI> &s;he &s;eem|ed
over joyed to &s;ee me, and I was no le&s;s to &s;ee her. As to her
Per&s;on, I found her not at all changed, but I could not forbear
laughing at her way of &s;peaking: She now under&s;tands very lit|tle
<HI>French,</HI> although &s;he continually &s;peaks and loves it &s;o much,
that it is impo&s;&s;ible for her to learn any other Language: But
&s;he now mixes <HI>Italian, Engli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> with her own Natu|ral
Language, and this makes &s;uch a <HI>Jargon,</HI> as is very &s;trange
to one, who knew her, as I did, to have the <HI>French</HI> Language,
in its purity, and able to read Lectures of it to the Learned. She
cannot endure to be told, that &s;he has forgot it, and indeed &s;he
does not believe it, having never left off &s;peaking it, either with
&s;ome of her own Women, or with Amba&s;&s;adors and Strangers,
who generally under&s;tood it. Neverthele&s;s, &s;he &s;peaks very ill.
And if one is not at the Fountain-head, it is difficult long to
&s;peak a Language well, which is every day changing, and con|tinually
making new progre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>I found the Ladies which were with her extream pretty: I
do a&s;&s;ure you, that there are in this Country &s;ome very hand|&s;ome
and amiable. We embraced each other often, and went
back to <HI>Madrid.</HI> Before we came there we pa&s;t over a &s;andy
Plain, of about Four Leagues, but &s;o uneven, that every mo|ment
we fell into Holes big enough to bury the Coach, and
which hindred it from going very fa&s;t. This uneven way la&s;ted
till we came to a little Village called <HI>Mandes,</HI> which is but half
a League from <HI>Madrid.</HI> All the Country here is dry, and very
open; you can &s;carcely &s;ee a Tree on any &s;ide you look: The
City is &s;cituated in the middle of <HI>Spain,</HI> which is <HI>New Ca&s;tile.</HI>
It is above an Age &s;ince the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> have cho&s;en to keep
<PB N="132" REF="135">
their Court in it, becau&s;e of the purity of the Air, and the
goodne&s;s of the Water, which really is &s;o good and &s;o light,
that the <HI>Cardinal Infanta</HI> would drink no other when he was in
<HI>Flanders;</HI> and he cau&s;ed it to be brought by Sea in Earthen
Jars well &s;topt. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend, that the Founder of
<HI>Madrid</HI> was a Prince named <HI>Ogno Bianor,</HI> Son of <HI>Tiberino,</HI> King
of the <HI>Latines,</HI> and of <HI>Manto,</HI> who had a <HI>Queen,</HI> more Famous
for the Science of <HI>A&s;trology,</HI> which &s;he under&s;tood to a won|derful
degree, $$an for her Birth. 'Tis thought, that <HI>Madrid</HI>
mu&s;t be in the Heart of <HI>Europe,</HI> becau&s;e the little Village of
<HI>Pinto,</HI> which is not above Three Leagues from it, is called in
<HI>Latine, Punctum;</HI> and that is reckoned to be in the Center of
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I ob&s;erved was, that the City is not enclo&s;ed
either with a Wall or Ditch; the Gates, as one may &s;ay, are
only made fa&s;t by a Latch; tho&s;e which I have already &s;een,
are all broken; there is not &s;een any place of Defence, nei|ther
Ca&s;tle, nor in a word, any thing which might not be for|ced
with throwing of Oranges and Lemmons; but yet it might
be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ortifie this City: The Mountains which are
round it, are of &s;ome u&s;e for its Defence. I have pa&s;&s;ed through
&s;ome places of them, which are &s;o narrow, that one might &s;hut
them up with a good big Stone, and with a hundred Men op|po&s;e
the pa&s;&s;age of a whole Army. The Streets are long and
&s;traight, and of a good largene&s;s, but there's no place wo&s;e
paved; let one go as &s;oftly as 'tis po&s;&s;ible, yet one is almo&s;t
jumbled and &s;haken to pieces; there are more Ditches and dirty
places than in any City in the World, the Hor&s;es go up to the
$Bellies, and the Coaches up to the middle, &s;o that it da&s;hes all
Gipon you, and you are &s;poyled unle&s;s you either pull up the
$$a&s;&s;es, or draw the Curtains which I have &s;poke of: very of|ten
the Water comes into the Coaches at the bottom of the
Boots, which are open.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;es there have rarely any great Gates to them, tho&s;e
which have are without Courts. The Doors indeed, are pret|ty
large; and for the Hou&s;es, they are very graceful, &s;pacious
and convenient, though they are only built of Earth and Brick.
I think they are altogether as dear at <HI>Paris.</HI> The fir&s;t Story
which they rai&s;e belongs to the <HI>King,</HI> and he can either let,
or &s;ell it, unle&s;s the Owner of the Hou&s;e buy it off, which is
almo&s;t con&s;tantly done, and this is a con&s;iderable Revenue to the
<HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>There is commonly in every Hou&s;e Ten or Twelve Rooms
on a Floor; in &s;ome Twenty and more; they have their <HI>Sum|mer</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="136">
and their <HI>Winter</HI> Apartments, and very often, one for Au|tumn,
and another for Spring-time: So that having very great
Families, they are forced to Lodge them in &s;ome Neighbouring
Hou&s;es, which they hire on purpo&s;e for them.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not wonder, Dear Co&s;en, that they have &s;o many
Dome&s;ticks: There are two Rea&s;ons for it. The fir&s;t is, that
both for Food and Wages the <HI>Spaniards</HI> give but two <HI>Rials</HI> a
day, which is not above Six pence of our Money. I &s;ay the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> do this, for Strangers pay after the rate of four <HI>Rials,</HI>
which is about Twelve pence of our Money. Neither do the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> give to their Gentlemen above Fifteen Crowns a
Month, with which they mu&s;t wear Velvet in Winter, and Taf|fety
in Summer: But then they live only upon Onions, Pea&s;e,
and &s;uch mean &s;tuff, and this makes the Pages and Footmen as
greedy as Doggs. But I &s;hould &s;peak of the other Dome&s;ticks as
well as the Pages, for in this matter they are all alike, let them
have what Wages they will. They are kept &s;o very hungry,
that in carrying the Di&s;hes to the Table, they eat half the
Victuals that is in them; they throw it into their Mouth &s;o
burning hot, that you &s;hall ob&s;erve their Teeth all rotten with
the Practice. I advi&s;ed my Kin&s;woman to get a little Silver
Stew-Pan made and fa&s;tened with a Padlock, that I &s;aw of
the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Burgos,</HI> and &s;he did &s;o, and now after the
Cook hath filled it, he looks through a little Grate to &s;ee whe|ther
the Soupe does well; and thus the Pages get nothing of
it but the Steam. Before this Invention, it happened a hun|dred
times, that when we thought to have taken up &s;ome
Broth, we found neither that, nor any Fle&s;h; for you mu&s;t
know that if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are Temperate, 'tis when the Ex|pence
is their own; they are not &s;o, when they eat at another's
co&s;t. I have &s;een Per&s;ons of the Highe&s;t Quality eat with us
like &s;o many Wol$$s, they were &s;o hungry: They were &s;en&s;i|ble
enough of it them&s;elves, and prayed us not to wonder at it,
for they found the <HI>Ragoas</HI> after the <HI>French</HI> way, &s;o excellent,
that they could not forbear.</P>
<P>There are Cooks-&s;hops almo&s;t at every corner of a Street:
The&s;e have great Kettles &s;et upon Trevets. There folks may
have &s;uch ordinary things as Beans, Garlick, Leeks, or a little
Broth, in which they &s;teep their Bread. The Gentlemen and
Waiting-women go thither as other People, for at home they
only dre&s;s Victuals for the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tri&s;s, and their Chil|dren.
They are &s;trangely Temperate in Wine; the Women
never drink any, and the Men &s;o little, that a quarter of a Pint
will &s;erve one a whole day. You cannot affront a Man wor&s;e,
<PB N="134" REF="137">
than to call him a <HI>Drunkard.</HI> Here's indeed, a great many
things to make up the fir&s;t Rea&s;on why they keep &s;o many Ser|vants.
Now follows the &s;econd.</P>
<P>When a great Man dies, if he had a hundred Servants, his
Son keeps all he found in the Hou&s;e, without putting one away:
When the Mother happens to dye, either her own Daughter
or her Daughter-in-law takes into her Service all the Women-|Servants,
and this Cu&s;tom holds to the fourth Generation, for
they are never turned away. They are put, as I have told you,
into neighbouring Hou&s;es, and have their <HI>Ration,</HI> or Allowan|ces.
They come often to their Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Hou&s;e, but
'tis rather to &s;hew they are not dead, than to do any Service.
I was to &s;ee the Dutche&s;s of <HI>O&s;&s;ona,</HI> which is a very great Lady,
and I was amazed to &s;ee &s;o many Chambermaids and Women,
for every Room was full of them. I askt her how many &s;he
had? She told me, &s;he had now only 300, but that very lately
&s;he had 500 more. If particular Per&s;ons have this Cu&s;tom of
keeping of &s;o many Servants, the <HI>King</HI> mu&s;t needs keep abun|dance
more, which without doubt is very chargeable to him,
and mu&s;t hurt his Affairs. I have been told that in <HI>Madrid</HI> only,
if the Pen&s;ions which he gives are reckoned, he gives <HI>Ration</HI> or
Allowances to above Ten Thou&s;and Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>As to the Kings Hou&s;e, the Provi&s;ion for it is daily brought
in, and it is regulated according to the Quality of the Per&s;ons.
There is di&s;tributed both tame and wild Fowl, Fi&s;h, Chocolate,
Fruit, Ice, Charcoal, Wax-Candles, Oyl, Bread, and in a word,
every thing that is nece&s;&s;ary for Life.</P>
<P><HI>Emba&s;&s;adours</HI> have their certain Expences, and &s;o have &s;ome
<HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> There are Per&s;ons appointed to Sell at their
Hou&s;es whatever I have ju&s;t now named, and that without pay|ing
any Cu&s;tom or Exci&s;e: And this &s;aves them a great deal of
Money, for the Duties upon all &s;orts of Goods and Wares are
exce&s;&s;ive high.</P>
<P>None but Emba&s;&s;adours and Strangers are allowed to have a
great many Footmen and Pages to follow them: For by the
<HI>Pragmatic</HI> (by which name they call all their Edicts of Re|formation,
they are forbidden to have any more than two Foot|men
to follow.) It is &s;omewhat &s;trange, that they who keep
four or five hundred Per&s;ons, may not be allowed above three
to accompany them. This third, you mu&s;t know, is a Groom,
which goes on foot, and keeps near the Hor&s;es, to hinder them
from putting and intangling their Leggs in their long Traces,
and he does not wear a Sword as the Footmen do: And I mu&s;t
<PB N="135" REF="138">
needs &s;ay, that if Age is a recommendable Quality, the&s;e three
Men have that in a good degree. I have &s;een Footmen of Fif|ty
Years of Age, and never any under Thirty. They are very
unplea&s;ant to look at, being very tawny, and of a Clowni&s;h A&s;|pect:
They cut their Hair clo&s;e on the top of their heads, only
let a Round be a little long, but very grea&s;ie, and &s;eldom comb|ed.
The Hair they cut on the top of their heads, is done in
the &s;hape of a Wild Boar's Head. They wear long Swords,
with Shoulder-Belts and Cloaks. They are all cloathed either
in Blew or Green, and often their green Cloth Cloaks are lined
with blew Velvet cut in Flowers, their Sleeves are either of
Velvet, Sattin, or Damask. One would think that
the&s;e &s;hould be hand&s;ome Liveries, but yet I a&s;&s;ure you, nothing
is uglier, and their ill Looks di&s;parage their Cloaths. They
wear Bands, but without any Collar, which is ridiculous. And
upon their Coaches they have neither Galloons, nor tufted But|tons
and Loops, nor any &s;ort of Lace or Trimming.</P>
<P>Their Gentlemen and their Pages always go in a Coach that
follows; the&s;e wear black Cloaths in all Sea&s;ons. In Winter
they wear Velvet, with Cloth Cloaks very long, but when they
Mourn, they draw upon the ground. Although they are Pages,
they wear no Swords, only mo&s;t of them have a little Poniard
hid under their Cloaths. In Summer they wear either Damask
or Taffety, with Cloaks of a black Stuff very light.</P>
<P>It is only the great <HI>Lords,</HI> and the <HI>Titulado's,</HI> or Men of
<HI>Title,</HI> which are permitted to have four Mules to their Coaches
with tho&s;e long Traces in the City. If any Per&s;on, without
the di&s;tinction of &s;ome Character, let him be as Rich as he will,
&s;hould appear in the &s;ame Equipage, he would be affronted
and abu&s;ed in the open Street, his Traces would be cut, and
him&s;elf Fined very high. Here it is not enough to be Rich, a
Man mu&s;t al&s;o be of &s;ome Quality. The <HI>King</HI> only, can have
&s;ix Mules to his own Coach, and to tho&s;e of his Attendants;
which Coaches are not like others, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by this,
that they are covered with green Oyl-Cloth round, as well as on
the top, ju&s;t as the Stage-Coaches in <HI>France,</HI> except that they
are not of Wickers, but the carved Work is very coar&s;e, and
ill done, and they have falling Boots, and all is very ugly, and
one would wonder how &s;o great a <HI>King</HI> can make u&s;e of them.
But I have been told, that the&s;e fa&s;hioned Coaches were in u&s;e
in <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth times, that his were ju&s;t like them; and
that it is in imitation of &s;o great an <HI>Emperour,</HI> that all the
<HI>Kings</HI> which have Reigned &s;ince, will have no other. Without
<PB N="136" REF="139">
doubt there mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;uch great Rea&s;on; for notwith&s;tand|ing
this, the <HI>King</HI> has as fine Coaches as any are in the World,
&s;ome made in <HI>France,</HI> and others in <HI>Italy,</HI> and other Parts. The
great Per&s;ons have al&s;o very &s;tately ones; but after the <HI>Kings</HI>
Example, they do not u&s;e them four times a Year. All Coach|es
are kept in large Courts, in which there are &s;everal Partitions
enclo&s;ed. There are it may be to the number of two hundred
in one Yard, and there are &s;everal of the&s;e Yards or Courts in
divers parts of the City. The Rea&s;on why they &s;et them a|broad
is, becau&s;e they have no room for them at home, their
Hou&s;es being built, as I have already &s;aid, without Courts or
great Gates, Of late, they begin to alter their Fa&s;hion, and
u&s;e Hor&s;es in&s;tead of mules. And to be ju&s;t, the&s;e Hor&s;es are
extream beautiful, there is nothing wanting to them, and it
would be difficult for the be&s;t Painters to draw any in greater
Perfection. But 'tis a piece of Cruelty to make them draw &s;uch
huge Coaches, which are almo&s;t as heavy as a Hou&s;e; be&s;ides
the Streets are &s;o very ill paved, that their Feet are quite &s;poy|led
in two Years time. They co&s;t very dear, and are not big
enough for their Coaches. But I have &s;een &s;ome draw their
pretty little <HI>Cala&s;hes,</HI> which were all painted and gilt, like tho&s;e
which are made in <HI>Holland,</HI> and nothing looked more plea&s;ant,
and by their &s;wift running, and hand&s;ome carrying of their
Heads, you would take them for Stags. As &s;oon as you are
out of Town you may put &s;ix Hor&s;es to your Coach. Their Har|ne&s;s
is very neat, and they trim their Manes, which hang to
the ground, with Ribbons of divers colours; and &s;ometimes
they dre&s;s up their Manes with a great many puffs of Silver
Gauze, which makes a very pretty &s;hew. The Harne&s;s for their
Mules, are made of Leather, flat and broad, with which they
cover them almo&s;t all over.</P>
<P>Two days ago I went with my Kin&s;woman to walk without
St. <HI>Barnardine</HI>'s Gate. 'Tis a place they frequent in Winter.
<HI>Don Antonio</HI> of <HI>Toledo,</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> was there,
with the Duke of <HI>Vzeda,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Altamire.</HI> He had
a Harne&s;s for his Hor&s;es of an <HI>I&s;abella</HI> colour, which &s;o plea&s;ed
me, that I could not forbear &s;peaking to him of it when his
Coach came near ours. According to Cu&s;tom, he told me, that
he laid them all at my Feet, and at Night when we got home,
I was told, that his Gentleman de&s;ired to &s;peak with me. He
made me a Complement, and told me, that his Ma&s;ter's &s;ix
Hor&s;es were in my Stable. My Kin&s;woman fell a laughing, and
made An&s;wer for me, that I was &s;o lately arrived at <HI>Madrid,</HI>
that I did not yet under&s;tand, that one mu&s;t not prai&s;e any

thing which belonged to &s;o generous a <HI>Cavaliero</HI> as <HI>Don Antonia,</HI>
but however, 'twas not the Fa&s;hion to receive Pre&s;ents of &s;o
great value, and de&s;ired him to take them back again. But this
he would not do, we &s;ent them back immediately, he return|ed
them, and &s;o did we. To be &s;hort, the whole Evening pa&s;t
thus in &s;ending backwards and forwards; and at la&s;t we were
forced to write him a Letter, and give our &s;elves a great deal
of Trouble to per&s;wade him not to take it ill, that I would not
accept them.</P>
<P>I am told, that after the <HI>King</HI> has once made u&s;e of a <HI>Hor&s;e,</HI>
in Re&s;pect to him, no body afterwards will ride on him. It
happened, that the Duke of <HI>Medina de las Torres</HI> had bought a
Hor&s;e worth Five and Twenty Thou&s;and Crowns, he was the
hand&s;ome&s;t and the brave&s;t which was ever &s;een. He cau&s;ed
his Picture to be taken. <HI>King Philip</HI> the Fourth &s;aw it, and had
a mind to &s;ee the Hor&s;e. The <HI>Duke</HI> begged him to accept of
him, but he refu&s;ed him, and gave this Rea&s;on, that as he
&s;hould &s;eldom ride on him, and that no body would make u&s;e
of him after he had mounted him, &s;o the &s;trength and u&s;eful|ne&s;s
of the Hor&s;e would be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ual here for good Families to put their younger
Daughters to <HI>Ladies;</HI> by whom they are employed for the mo&s;t
part to Embroider in Gold and Silver, or in Silk of various co|lours,
about their Shift-Necks or Hands: But if they are left to
follow their own Natural Inclination, they work very little, and
talk much. They keep al&s;o both Male and Female Dwarfs,
and very ugly ones: The Females particularly have very fright|ful
looks, their Heads are bigger than their Bodies; they always
wear their Hair loo&s;e about t$eir Ears, and hanging down to
the ground: At fir&s;t &s;ight, one would wonder what the&s;e little
Figures were when they pre&s;ent them&s;elves before ones Eyes.
They wear Rich Cloaths; they are their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Confidents,
and for this Rea&s;on, they are denyed nothing they have a mind
to.</P>
<P>In every Hou&s;e at a certain &s;tated hour, all the Women meet
with the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Family in the Chappel, there to re|peat
their <HI>Ro&s;ary</HI> aloud; they make u&s;e of no Book to &s;ay their
Prayers by; indeed it is very &s;eldom they have any. The
Count of <HI>Charny,</HI> who is a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> very hand&s;om, and of
great worth, and is the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s General of his Hor&s;e in
<HI>Catalonia,</HI> told me, that the other day being at <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> and as
he was &s;aying his Prayers by his Book, an Old <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Woman
came and &s;natched it from him, and with great indignation
threw it to the ground, &s;aying to him, <HI>Let this alone, and make
<PB N="138" REF="141">
u&s;e of your Beads.</HI> It is a &s;trange thing to con&s;ider how conti|nually
fond they are of their <HI>Beads,</HI> every Woman there has a
pair fa&s;tned to her Girdle, and &s;o long, that they almo&s;t touch
the ground. They are perpetually without cea&s;ing u&s;ing them,
in the Street, as they play at <HI>Ombre,</HI> as they Di&s;cour&s;e, nay,
when they are making Love, when they are telling Lies, or
&s;peaking evil of their Neighbours. They are continually mut|tering
over their <HI>Beads,</HI> let them be in never &s;o much Compa|ny,
nothing of this hinders them &s;till to keep on their pace.
I leave you to judge what Devotion there can be in this, but
Cu&s;tom has a great Power in this Country.</P>
<P>Till of late, Women wore Vertingales of a prodigious big|ne&s;s,
this Fa&s;hion was very trouble&s;ome to them&s;elves as well as
others. There were hardly any doors wide enough for them
to go through: But they have left them off now, and only wear
them when they go to appear in the Queen's or the King's
Pre&s;ence: Commonly in the City they wear a certain &s;ort of
Ve&s;tment, which to &s;peak properly, is a <HI>young or little Vertin|gale.</HI>
They are made of thick Copper Wyre in a round form,
about the Girdle, there are Ribbons fa&s;tned to them, with
which they tye another round of the &s;ame form, which falls
down a little lower, and which is wider; and of the&s;e they
have five or &s;ix rounds which reach down to the ground, and
bear out their Petticoats and other Garments. They wear a
va&s;t number of this Device; and one would hardly believe that
&s;o little Creatures as the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women are, could bear &s;uch a
load. Their upper Garment is always of a cosr&s;e black Taffety,
or of a grey plain Stuff made of Goats-hair, with a Tra&s;s or
Fardle coming down a little above the Kneees, and round the
upper Garments; and if you ask them to what end this &s;erves?
they'll an&s;wer you, that with this they can make it longer as it
wears out. The <HI>Queen-Mother,</HI> as well as others, u&s;e this to
all her Garments. Even the <HI>Carmelites</HI> wear them in <HI>France</HI> as
well as in <HI>Spain.</HI> But as to Women, it is rather a Fa&s;hion
which they follow, than any Frugality; for they are neither
Covetous nor good Hou&s;ewifes, and of the&s;e things, they have
two or three new ones a Week. The&s;e upper Garments are
&s;o long before and on the &s;ides, that they draw a great deal
upon the ground, but behind, they do not draw at all. Though
they wear them down &s;o low, yet they will tread upon them,
that their Feet may not be &s;een, which are the parts they mo&s;t
indu&s;triou&s;ly hide. I have heard &s;ay, that after a Lady has
Obliged her Gallant by all po&s;&s;ible Civilities and Compliance, to
confirm to him her Kindne&s;s, &s;he will &s;hew him her foot; and
<PB N="139" REF="142">
this here, they call the highe&s;t Favour; one mu&s;t needs own,
that in its kind, there is nothing prettier. As I have already
told you their Feet are &s;o &s;mall, that their Shooes look like
tho&s;e of our Babies. They are made of black <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Leather,
cut upon coloured Taffety, without Heels, and as &s;trait as a
Glove. When they go, you would think they flew; we &s;hould
not in a hundred Years learn their way of walking, they keep
their Elbows clo&s;e to their &s;ides, and go without rai&s;ing their
Feet ju&s;t as one &s;lides. But to return to their Habit; under
this plain upper Garment, they have a dozen more, one finer,
than another, of rich Stuffs, and trimed with Galloons and Lace
of Gold and Silver, to the Girdle. That I have told you a
dozen, pray do not think that I exceed the Truth: During the
exce&s;&s;ive Heats of the Summer, they only wear &s;even or eight, of
which &s;ome are of Velvet, and others of thick Sattin. They
wear at all times a white Garment under all the re&s;t, which
they call <HI>Sabengua;</HI> it is made either of the fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lace,
or of Mu&s;lin embroidered with Gold, and &s;o wide, that they are
four Ells in compa&s;s. I have &s;een of the&s;e worth five or &s;ix
hundred Crowns. At home they wear neither the little Vertin|gale
nor Patens, the&s;e la&s;t are a &s;ort of little Sandal, made of
Brocado or Velvet, &s;et upon Plates of Gold, which rai&s;e them
half a Foot, and when they have the&s;e, they walk very ill, and
are apt to fall. They u&s;e but very little Whale-bone in their
Stays, the mid&s;t of which are a third part of an Ell. One can
hardly &s;ee in other Countries Women &s;o &s;lender. They &s;hape
their Bodies before pretty high, but behind, you may &s;ee them
to the middle of the back, they are &s;o naked, and yet this is
no Charming &s;ight, for they are all dreadful lean, though they
would be very &s;orry to be fat. And this is a great Error among
them. Be&s;ides, they are very &s;warthy; &s;o that this brown
Skin which is glewed to their backs, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be di&s;|plea&s;ing
to tho&s;e who are not u&s;ed to it. They put <HI>Red</HI> upon
their Shoulders, which are all naked, as well as on their
Cheecks. Neither do they want there for <HI>White,</HI> which is very
good, but there are few which know how to u&s;e it; at fir&s;t &s;ight
you can di&s;cern it. I have &s;een &s;ome of a very clear Com|plexion
that was Natural. Mo&s;t of them have very fine and
exact Features; in their Looks and all their Actions you may
&s;ee a little affectation of being Courted, which their Humour
does not di&s;&s;emble. It's reckoned beautiful among them to have
no Brea&s;ts, and they take care very early to hinder them from
growing big. As &s;oon as they begin to appear, they bind thin
pieces of Lead upon them, as clo&s;e as one would &s;waddle a Child.
<PB N="140" REF="143">
And indeed their Brea&s;ts are as flat and even as a &s;heet of Pa|per,
except the holes and hollowne&s;s, which their leanne&s;s cau|&s;es,
and tho&s;e are pretty many. Their hands have no defect,
they are little, white, and well &s;haped. Their large Sleeves, which
they fa&s;ten at the bottom of their wri&s;ts, &s;till contribute to make
them appear le&s;s. The&s;e Sleeves are made of Taffety of all co|lours,
like tho&s;e of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> with Ruffles of broad Lace.
Their Stays are commonly of Gold and Silver Stuffs, mixed
with lively colours; the Sleeves of them are very &s;trait, and
their Silk Sleeves appear in&s;tead of their Shifts. Neverthele&s;s,
People of Quality wear very fine Linnen; but all others wear
little or none. It is &s;carce and dear, be&s;ides, the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have that fooli&s;h Vanity to de&s;ire it very fine; in&s;omuch that
they had rather have but one &s;uch Shift than half a dozen a lit|tle
coar&s;e; and either lie in Bed till 'tis wa&s;hed, or el&s;e dre&s;s
them&s;elves without any, which they frequently enough do. They
u&s;e this fine Linnen after an ill manner when they wa&s;h it; for
the Women lay it upon rough Stones, and &s;o beat it hard with
a &s;tick, by which means, there &s;hall be a hundred holes in't im|mediately.
There's no difference between the be&s;t and the
wor&s;t Landre&s;s; all the&s;e Creatures are very aukward.</P>
<P>But to return to the Womens Cloaths, which I have often left,
that I might give an Account of &s;everal things which occurred
to me. I mu&s;t tell you, that they wear about their Necks Bone|lace,
embroidered over either with red or green Silk, or Gold
or Silver. They wear Girdles all of Medals and Reliques. There
are divers <HI>Churches</HI> which have not &s;o many; they wear al&s;o the
Cord of &s;ome <HI>Order,</HI> either of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> or
&s;ome other. It is a &s;mall Cord, made either of black, white,
or brown Wool, and is worn on the out-&s;ide of their Stays, and
hangs down before to the edge of their Petticoats. They are
full of knots, and commonly upon every knot there's a Dia|mond-&s;tone
fa&s;tned. They make Vows to &s;ome Saint or other
to wear their Cords; but if the rea&s;on of the&s;e Vows was enqui|red
into, it would not be found very good.</P>
<P>They have great &s;tore of <HI>Jewels,</HI> the fine&s;t that can be &s;een.
Neither is it enough to have one Sett of <HI>Jewels,</HI> as our Ladies
in <HI>France</HI> have, but the&s;e mu&s;t have Eight or Ten; &s;ome of
<HI>Diamonds,</HI> others of <HI>Rubies, Emeralds, Pearls, Turkey-&s;tones;</HI>
and in &s;hort, of all &s;orts. But the work-men &s;et them very
ill, for the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Diamond</HI> is hid, very little of
it is &s;een. I asked the rea&s;on of it, and they told me, that to
them, the Gold looked as well as the Stones. But I am of
<PB N="141" REF="144">
Opinion, that their Lapidaries do not under&s;tand how to &s;et
them better. I mu&s;t except <HI>Verbec,</HI> who can do them well if
he will take the pains.</P>
<P>The Ladies wear at the top of their Stays a broad knot of
<HI>Diamonds,</HI> from whence there hangs a Chain of <HI>Pearl,</HI> or ten
or twelve knots of <HI>Diamonds,</HI> which they fa&s;ten at the other
end, to their &s;ides. They never wear any Necklace, but they
wear Bracelets, Rings, and Pendants; which la&s;t are longer
than ones Hand, and &s;o heavy, that I have wonder'd how they
could carry them without tearing out the hole of their Ears.
To which they add whatever they think pretty. I have &s;een
&s;ome have good large Watches hanging there, other Padlocks
of Precious Stones, and even your fine wrought <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Keys,
and little Bells. They al&s;o carry upon their Sleeves, their Shoul|ders,
and all about their Bodies. <HI>Agnus Dei</HI>'s, and little Images.
They have their Heads &s;tuck full of Bodkins, &s;ome made of
Diamonds in the &s;hape of a Flye, and others like Butterflies,
who&s;e colours are di&s;tingui&s;hed by various Stones. They dre&s;s
their Heads after &s;everal Fa&s;hions, but &s;till they mu&s;t be naked;
they part their Hair on the &s;ides of their Heads, and lay it cro&s;s
on their foreheads; it &s;hines &s;o, that without lying, one may
&s;ee them&s;elves in it. Formerly they wore a Tre&s;s or Lock of
Hair, the wor&s;t made that one &s;hould &s;ee, and this fell all &s;pread
upon their Shoulders, le&s;t their own Hair &s;hould mix with it,
which indeed is very fine. They have u&s;ually five-broidered
Rolls, to which they fa&s;ten Knots of Ribbons, or el&s;e Pearls,
and the&s;e they tye altogether to their Girdles, and in Summer
when they are at home, they wrap them up in a piece of co|lour'd
Taffety, trim'd with Thred Bonelace. They never wear
any &s;ort of Coif, either Night or Day. I have &s;een &s;ome which
had their Heads dre&s;t up with Feathers like little Children:
The&s;e Feathers are very curious, and &s;potted with different
colours, which made them much more beautiful. I cannot
imagine, why they do not make &s;uch in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The young Women, or new marry'd, have very Rich Cloaths,
and their upper Garments are coloured and embroidered with
Gold. I was to &s;ee the Prince&s;s of <HI>Monteleon:</HI> She's a little
Body not above Thirteen Years old, and &s;he is lately marry'd
to her Cou&s;in-German, named <HI>Don Nicholas Pignatelli;</HI> her
Mother is the Daughter of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> nomi|nated
to be <HI>Camarera major,</HI> or fir&s;t Maid of Honour to the
new Queen. The&s;e, that is to &s;ay, the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Terra No|va,
D'Hijar</HI> and <HI>Monteleon,</HI> which the Young Prince&s;s of the
&s;ame Name, and her little Si&s;ters, dwell all altogether. The Dut|che&s;s
<PB N="142" REF="145">
of <HI>Terra Nova</HI> may be about Three&s;core Years old; my
Kin&s;woman is one of her intimate Friends, and &s;he receiv'd us
with &s;uch Civility and Kindne&s;s as is not u&s;ual with her: For
it may be, there is not in the World a more haughty Spirit,
which her very looks declare. Her voice is har&s;h, &s;he &s;peaks
little, and would be thought of a kind and good Nature; but
if what is &s;aid, be true, &s;he is not really &s;o: One &s;hall hardly
meet with a greater &s;hare of Wit, and a more piercing Judg|ment,
than &s;he has; &s;he di&s;cour&s;ed to us much of the Place &s;he
was going to take upon her in the Queen's Hou&s;e. Says &s;he,
I'll neglect nothing to make my &s;elf acceptable to her, I'll en|deavour
to di&s;cover every thing that may plea&s;e her; I am &s;en|&s;ible
that a young Prince&s;s born in <HI>France,</HI> mu&s;t be allowed
a greater Liberty than an <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> born at <HI>Madrid.</HI>
So that by me, &s;he &s;hall not be able to find any difference be|twixt
this and her own Country. She pre&s;ented me with a pair
of Beads of <HI>Paulo d' Aguila,</HI> which is a curious &s;ort of Wood
that comes from the <HI>Indies.</HI> Really they are &s;o long, that when
I hold them in my hands they reacht to the ground. They are
trim'd with two bunches of &s;mall green Taffety Ribbon, each
bunch has about three hundred Ells in it. She gave me al&s;o
&s;ome <HI>Pucatos</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> which are Pots and Di&s;hes made of
that Medicinal Earth, and are adorn'd with Filigrane Work:
And &s;he pre&s;ented me likewi&s;e with &s;everal other pretty Toys&punc;</P>
<P>One can hardly &s;ee any thing that looks more &s;plendid than
this Hou&s;e of theirs; they u&s;e the upper Apartments, which are
hung with Tapi&s;try all done with rais'd Work of Gold. In one
great Chamber, which is longer than 'tis broad, you may &s;ee
&s;everal Gla&s;s doors which go into Clo&s;ets or little Cells. The
fir&s;t of which is the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Terra Nova</HI>' s hung with grey,
and a Bed of the &s;ame, and all other things very plain. On
one &s;ide lodges her Daughter, the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Monteleon,</HI> who
is a Widow, and has her Room furni&s;h'd like her Mother's.
Afterwards you come to the Prince&s;s of <HI>Monteleon</HI>'s Chamber,
which is not larger than the others, but her Bed is of Gold and
green Damask, lin'd with Silver Brocade, and trim'd with Point
<HI>De Spain.</HI> The Sheets were lac'd about with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lace
of half an Ell deep. Over again&s;t it were the Chambers of
<HI>M$nteleon</HI> and <HI>Hijar</HI>'s Children, which were Furni&s;h'd with white
D$mask. Next to the&s;e is the little Chamber of the Dutche&s;s
<HI>Ai$$r,</HI> Furni&s;h'd with Crim&s;on-colour'd Velvet upon a Gold
Ground. Their Rooms were no otherwi&s;e divided than by
Partitions of a certain Sweet Wood; and they told me, that
&s;ix of their Women lay in their Chambers, upon Beds brought
thither at Night.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="146">
The Ladies were in a great Gallery, &s;pread with a very rich
Foot-cloth; there were &s;et round it Crim&s;on-colour'd Velvet
Cu&s;hions embroidred with Gold, and they are longer than they
are broad: There were al&s;o &s;everal great Cabinets in-laid, and a|dorn'd
with Precious Stones, but they are not made in <HI>Spain;</HI>
and between them were Tables of Silver, and admirable Look|ing-Gla&s;&s;es,
both for their largene&s;s and rich Frames, the wor&s;t
of which were of Silver. But that which I thought fine&s;t,
were their <HI>E&s;caparates,</HI> which is a certain &s;ort of a clo&s;e Cabinet
with one great Gla&s;s, and fill'd with all the Rarities which one
can imagine, whether it be in <HI>Amber-grea&s;e, Porceline, Cry&s;tal,
Bezoar-&s;tone, Branches of Coral, Mother of Pearl, Fillagran in
Gold,</HI> and a thou&s;and other things of Value. There I &s;aw a
Fi&s;h, and upon its Head there was a little Tree; it was neither
of Wood nor of Mo&s;s; it grew on the top of the Fi&s;h's Scull,
which is very &s;mall. This &s;eem'd to me a great Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>We were above three&s;core Women in this Gallery, and not
&s;o much as one Man among us. They all &s;at down upon the
Floor cro&s;s-legg'd. This is an Old Cu&s;tom, which they have
deriv'd from the <HI>Moors.</HI> There was only one great Elbow-|Chair
of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Leather &s;titch'd with Silk, and very ugly. I
ask'd for whom it was de&s;ign'd? They told me it was for the
Prince of <HI>Monteleon,</HI> who came not in till after all the Ladies
were retir'd. I could not long &s;it after this Fa&s;hion, and there|fore
I got &s;ome Cu&s;hions under me, five or &s;ix of which were
fa&s;tued together by a Silver Brace full of Olive-&s;tones, that it
might not break through. When any Lady comes to Vi&s;it, the
<HI>He</HI> or <HI>She-Dwarf</HI> comes to gives notice, by kneeling down up|on
one Knee, upon which all the Company ri&s;es, and the young
<HI>Prince&s;s</HI> walks before as far as the Door to receive her which
comes to &s;ee her after her Marriage. In Saluting each other,
they do not ki&s;s, perhaps, that is, becau&s;e they will not rub off
the colour from one anothers Faces; but they &s;hake hands with
their Gloves off, and in Di&s;cour&s;e, they &s;ay <HI>Thou</HI> and <HI>Thee;</HI> and
without calling one another either, <HI>Madam,</HI> or <HI>Lady,</HI> or <HI>High|ne&s;s,</HI>
or <HI>Excellency,</HI> they only &s;ay, <HI>Donna Maria, Donna Clara,</HI> or
<HI>Donna There&s;a.</HI> I was willing to know the rea&s;on of this Familiar
way, and I learnt it was to avoid all occa&s;ion of Offence a|mong&s;t
them; and that as there were different ways of &s;peaking
to di&s;tingui&s;h the great difference of Quality and Degree, and
that it was not ea&s;ie to ob&s;erve all the Rules about them, with|out
&s;ometimes giving di&s;ta&s;te; therefore to prevent which,
they have cho&s;en to &s;peak to each other without any Ceremo|ny
at all. I mu&s;t al&s;o add, that the Women here do not in|termix,
<PB N="144" REF="147">
and &s;o the&s;e are always Per&s;ons of Quality together.
The Wives of the Long Robe never &s;o much as to go to vi&s;it the
Court-Ladies, and a Man of Birth never marries with a Wo|man
of Quality: Here one never &s;ees tho&s;e which are not
Gentlemen mix with the Nobility, as in <HI>France;</HI> &s;o that there
can be little danger, as long as they a&s;&s;ociate together. If
there comes in a hundred Ladies one after another, every one
ri&s;es up as o$ten, and they go, as in Proce&s;&s;ion, as far as the
Anti-Chamber to receive them. I was &s;o tyr'd that day, that
I was in a very ill Humour.</P>
<P>They were all very well dre&s;s'd; and as I have already told
you, they have very rich Cloaths, and their Jewels are extream
fine. There were two Tables for the Game of <HI>Ombro,</HI> at which
they play'd very high, and without any Noi&s;e. I could not un|der&s;tand
their Cards; they are as thin as Paper, and painted
after a quite different way from ours. One of tho&s;e Cards look
as if one held a Letter; when they have a good Game in hand,
it were ea&s;ie for a Cheating Game&s;ter to di&s;cover &s;everal of
their Cards, if not the whole Game.</P>
<P>While they play'd, they di&s;cours'd of News, of the Court
and the City: Their Conver&s;ation is free and plea&s;ant, and it mu&s;t
needs be confe&s;s'd, that they have a certain quickne&s;s of Wit,
which we cannot come up to. They are very kind and friend|ly,
they love to prai&s;e, and do it after a gentile way, very in|geniou&s;ly,
and with great Judgment. I am amaz'd to find &s;uch
&s;trength of Memory joyn'd with &s;o great a degree of Wit and
Under&s;tanding. They are compa&s;&s;ionate, even almo&s;t to a
f$$$t. They read little and write not much; but yet by that
little which they do read, they improve much, and that little
they write is both exact and conci&s;e.</P>
<P>Their Features are very regular and delicate; but their ex|ce&s;&s;ive
leanne&s;s offends one that is not us'd to it. They are of
a brown Complexion, and their faces very &s;mooth: The Small-Pox
mu&s;t needs not do them &s;o much hurt here, as in other
Countries, for I have &s;eldom &s;een any mark'd with them.</P>
<P>Their Hair is a black as Jett, and very &s;hining, notwith&s;tan|ding
there is cau&s;e to think that they comb long with one and
the &s;ame Comb, for t'other day I &s;aw at the Marchione&s;s of <HI>Al|con$$zas</HI>
(who is Si&s;ter to the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> and who&s;e
fir&s;t Husband was the Count and Duke of <HI>Olivares</HI>) her Toylet
&s;pread; and although &s;he is one of the neate&s;t and riche&s;t La|dies,
and the $word$ was laid upon a little Silver Table, yet it
was only $word$ with a little bit of Callico, a Looking-Gla&s;s
$word$ bigger $word$ ones Hand, two Combs, and a little Box, and
<PB N="145" REF="148">
in a &s;mall <HI>China</HI> Cup &s;ome White of an Egg beat together with
Sugar-candy. I ask'd one of her Women what &s;he did with
this; &s;he told me, this was to take the dirt off her Face, and to
make it &s;hine. I have &s;een &s;ome who&s;e Faces were &s;o bright,
that you would wonder. One would think that they were Var|ni&s;h'd
over; and the Skin is &s;o pull'd and rub'd, that I am con|fident
it does a great deal of hurt. Mo&s;t of the Women make
them&s;elves Eye-brows, and they have only as 'twere a little
thred of Hair, which in my mind looks very ugly; but that
which is yet wor&s;e, is they comb the middle of their Fore|heads
&s;o much till they make their Eye-brows meet; and this
with them is extream Beautiful.</P>
<P>But yet there are a great many who&s;e Fancies do not lye
this way, I have &s;een &s;ome <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women more exact to the
Rules of Beauty than our <HI>French</HI> Women, notwith&s;tanding their
way of dre&s;&s;ing cro&s;s-wi&s;e, and the little advantage which they
give to their Faces. One may &s;ay, that they are like things
made out of Rule, for they have neither Hair, nor Cornet, nor
any Ribbon, to &s;et them o$f; and yet, what Country can &s;hew
&s;uch Eyes as theirs? They are &s;o very &s;prightly, and declare
&s;o much Wit, and by them, talk to one in a Language &s;o kind
and intelligible, that if they had no other Charms, the&s;e alone
would make them pa&s;s for hand&s;ome Women, and unavoidably
&s;teal away ones Affections. Their Teeth are very even, and
would be white enough, if they took a little care of them, but
they neglect them; and be&s;ides, their frequent u&s;e of <HI>Sugar</HI>
and <HI>Chocolate</HI> does them much hurt. They have all a bad Cu|&s;tom
here, the Women as well as the Men, which is to pick
their Teeth, let them be in what Company they will: This
they reckon as a Diver&s;ion&punc; and do it with grave looks. They
do not &s;o much as know what belongs to having them cleans'd
by an Arti&s;t, there is no &s;uch Trade there, and when they need
them to be drawn out, they get the Surgeons to do it, if they
can.</P>
<P>At my fir&s;t coming in to Vi&s;it the <HI>Prince&s;s</HI> of <HI>Monteleon,</HI> I
was &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee &s;o many young Ladies with great Specta|cles
on their No&s;es, and fa&s;tned to their Ears; but that which
yet &s;eem'd &s;trange&s;t to me, was, that they made no u&s;e of them
where it was nece&s;&s;ary: They only di&s;cours'd while they had
them on; I was di&s;turb'd at it, and ask'd the Marchione&s;s <HI>De la
Ro&s;a</HI> (with whom I have contracted a dear Friend&s;hip) the rea|&s;on
of it: She's a pretty &s;ort of Woman, and under&s;tands how
to live. She has a neat Wit, and is a <HI>Neapolitan.</HI> She fell a
<PB N="146" REF="149">
Laughing at my Que&s;tion, and told me, that it was done to
make them look grave, that they did not wear them for any
need, but to draw Re&s;pect. Do you &s;ee that Lady, &s;ays &s;he to
me? meaning one that was near us, I do not believe, that &s;ince
&s;he was ten Years Old, &s;he ever left them off, but when &s;he
went to Bed. Without lying, they both eat with them, and
in the Streets and A&s;&s;emblies you can never fail of meeting a|bundance
of Men and Women with their Spectacles. Upon
this Occa&s;ion, I mu&s;t needs tell you, continued &s;he, that &s;ome
time ago, the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Friars had a Suit in Law of high Im|portance;
the &s;ucce&s;s of which they were too much concerned
for, to neglect any means. One of the Young <HI>Fathers</HI> of the
Convent had &s;ome Kindred of the greate&s;t Quality, which upon
his Account did &s;ollicit very hard on their behalf. The <HI>Prior</HI>
a&s;&s;ur'd him, that if through his Credit and Intere&s;t they &s;hould
get the better of the Suit, he could ask nothing that &s;hould not
be granted him for an Acknowledgment: At la&s;t, they gain'd
their Point, and the Young Father, tran&s;ported with Joy, im|mediately
ran to tell the News, and at the &s;ame time prepar'd
him&s;elf to ask a Favour which a long time he had had a migh|ty
de&s;ire to obtain. But the <HI>Prior,</HI> after having embrac'd him,
with grave looks and tone, &s;aid to him, <HI>Hermano, ponga las
Ojalas,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Brother, Put on Spectacles.</HI> The Honour
of this Permi&s;&s;ion filled the Young Monk with a &s;trange Joy;
he thought him&s;elf and his care too highly recompen&s;ed, and
had nothing el&s;e to ask. The Marque&s;s of <HI>A&s;torgas,</HI> Vice-Roy
of <HI>Naples,</HI> added &s;he, had his Statue to the middle cut in
Marble, upon which he was very careful to cau&s;e his be&s;t
Spectacles to be put. It is &s;o common a thing to wear them,
that I have heard, there are different Spectacles, according to
the different Qualities and Degrees of Men and Women. Pro|portionably
as a Man's Fortune ri&s;es, he increa&s;es in the large|ne&s;s
of his Spectacle-Gla&s;&s;es and wears them higher upon his
No&s;e. The <HI>Grandees of Spain</HI> wear them as broad as one Hands,
which for di&s;tinction, they call <HI>Ocales.</HI> They fa&s;ten them be|hind
their Ears, and leave them off as &s;eldom as they do their
Collars. Heretofore they had the Gla&s;&s;es of them from <HI>Venice,</HI>
but ever &s;ince their Enterprize of the Marque&s;s of <HI>Cueva,</HI> which
was called the <HI>Triumvirat,</HI> becau&s;e they were three Per&s;ons who
undertook to fire $word$ Ar&s;enal of <HI>Venice</HI> with Burning-Gla&s;&s;es,
and by this means to make the King of <HI>Spain</HI> Ma&s;ter of that
City: The <HI>Venetians,</HI> to be reveng'd, caus'd a va&s;t number of
tho&s;e <HI>Ocales</HI> to be made, and &s;ent to their Emba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Ma|drid.</HI>
He pre&s;ented of them to the whole Court, and all that
<PB N="147" REF="150">
us'd them were almo&s;t blinded with them; for they were made
of burning Gla&s;s, and very artificially done, and &s;et in certain
Frames made of combu&s;tible Matter, which with the lea&s;t Rays
of the Sun would put all in a Flame. It happen'd upon a
Council-day, that in the Room where they &s;at, one of the
Windows was left open, and the Sun &s;hining perpendicularly
upon their Spectacles, all on a &s;udden they perceiv'd a dange|rous
&s;ort of fire contriv'd again&s;t their Eye-brows and Hair;
one can hardly imagine what a Fright the&s;e venerable old Men
were in. I could wi&s;h, &s;aid I to the <HI>Marchione&s;s,</HI> that this &s;to|ry
were credible, for 'tis very plea&s;ant. As I did not &s;ee it, re|ply'd
&s;he in &s;miling, &s;o I cannot po&s;itively a&s;&s;ure you that 'tis
true: But the bus'ne&s;s of the <HI>Jacobite Friars</HI> which I have rela|ted
to you, I had from the be&s;t Authority. I have &s;ince, ob|&s;erv'd
&s;everal Per&s;ons of Quality in their Coaches, &s;ometimes
alone, and &s;ometimes in Company, with the&s;e great Spectacles
hung upon their No&s;es, which in my Mind, is a &s;trange &s;ight.</P>
<P>This Prince&s;s gave us a Collation, her Women, to the num|ber
of eighteen, brought every one of them a great Silver Ba|&s;on
full of dry Sweet-meats, wrapt up in a Paper, for that pur|po&s;e
cut and guilt. In one, there was a Plum, in another a
Cherry or an Apricock, and &s;o in all the re&s;t accordingly.
This to me &s;eem'd very neat, for by this way, one might either
eat or carry away, without &s;oyling the Fingers or Pockets.
There were &s;ome ancient Ladies, who after they had eat of
the&s;e Sweet-meats till they were ready to bur&s;t, fill$d five or &s;ix
Hankerchiefs full, and they bring them on purpo&s;e; and al|though
they are well ob&s;erv'd, yet no notice &s;eems to be taken,
but they are &s;uffer'd to take as much and as oft as they will;
they tye the&s;e Handkerchiefs with &s;trings quite round their lit|tle
Vertingales: This is like the hook which is us'd in a Pan|try,
upon which is hung all &s;orts of Fle&s;h and Fowl. After|wards
they pre&s;ent you with Chocolate, every one a China Cup
full upon a little Di&s;h of Agat &s;et in Gold, with sugar in a
Box of the &s;ame. There was &s;ome Chocolate order'd with Ice,
and &s;ome hot, and &s;ome made with Milk and Eggs: One drinks
it with &s;ome Bisket, or el&s;e with &s;ome thin bread as hard as if
it were toa&s;ted, which they make &s;o on purpo&s;e. There are
&s;ome Women which will drink &s;ix Cups one after another, and
this they do very often, twice or thrice a day. One &s;hould not
wonder that they are &s;o dry, &s;ince nothing is hotter than this
Liquor; and be&s;ides, they eat every thing &s;o very high &s;ea|&s;on'd
with Pepper and Spice, that one would think it impo&s;&s;ible
they are not burnt up: There were &s;everal al&s;o, which eat
<PB N="148" REF="151">
great pieces of the Medicinal Earth. I have already told you
that they have even a great pa&s;&s;ion for this Earth, which fre|quently
cau&s;es in them great Ob&s;tructions; their Stomachs and
their Bellies will be &s;welled with it, and become as hard as a
Stone, and they them&s;elves as yellow as Saffron. I had a mind
to ta&s;te this <HI>Ragoue,</HI> which is &s;o much e&s;teem'd beyond its
worth, but I declare I had rather eat a piece of a Stone.</P>
<P>If one had a mind to oblige them, one mu&s;t treat them with
&s;uch kind of things which they call <HI>Barros;</HI> and very often
their Confe&s;&s;ors enjoyn them to no other <HI>Pennance,</HI> than to for|bear
one whole day from eating thereof. It is &s;aid to have a
great many Properties; and is good again&s;t Poy&s;on, and cures
abundance of Di&s;ea&s;es. I have a great Cup made of it, which
holds a pint; it &s;poils Wine that's put into it, but it makes
Water excellent, which &s;eems as if it boyl'd in it, at lea&s;t one
may ob&s;erve it to work and fret, if it is proper to &s;ay &s;o; and
if one leaves it a little while, the Cup &s;hall be quite empty, the
nature of the Earth makes it &s;o full of Pores; it has a &s;trong
&s;ent. We drank Water there, which was very well order'd;
one may truly &s;ay, that in no place they drink it cooler: They
make u&s;e only of Snow, and are of Opinion that it cools much
better than Ice; It is the cu&s;tom here to drink very cold water
before they take their Chocolate, which otherwi&s;e they think
would be unwhol&s;ome.</P>
<P>After the Collation was ended, Flamboys were brought in;
there came in fir&s;t a little &s;imple Fellow, white with Age, who
was Governour of the Pages: He had a great Gold Chain and
a Medal about his Neck; this was the pre&s;ent he had at the
Prince of <HI>Monteleon</HI>'s Marriage: He kneel'd down upon one Knee
in the middle of the Gallery, and aloud, &s;aid, <HI>Let the mo&s;t Holy
Sacrament be prais'd;</HI> to which every body an&s;wer'd, <HI>For ever:</HI>
This is their Cu&s;tom, when Light is brought in. Next came
in four and twenty Pages following two by two, and in the
&s;ame manner kneel'd upon one Knee; every one of them
brought two great Flamboys, or one Branch, and when they
had plac'd them upon the Tables, went out with the &s;ame Ce|remony.
And then all the Ladies made to each other a low
bow, accompany'd with a wi&s;h, as when they &s;neeze. It is fit
I &s;hould tell you, that the&s;e Branches are full of Lamps fa&s;tned
to a Silver Pillar, who&s;e Foot is very broad; there are mo&s;t
times eight and twelve Pipes to every Lamp, in which the
Week burns, &s;o that this gives a very great Light. And to
encrea&s;e it yet more, they fa&s;ten a &s;ilver Plate to it, in &s;uch
manner, that the Light reflects upon it. One is not troubled
<PB N="149" REF="152">
with the Smoak, and the Oyl they burn is altogether as good as
that of <HI>Provence,</HI> which is eat with Sallads. I lik'd this fa&s;hion
very well. When all the Lights were put in their proper pla|ces
in the Gallery, the young Prince&s;s of <HI>Monteleon</HI> bid her Wo|men
bring her Wedding-cloaths, that I might &s;ee them; they
brought thirty &s;ilver Baskets full, which were as deep and as
wide, as Table Baskets; they were &s;o heavy, that there were
four Women to carry one Basket. In them there was, what
ever is po&s;&s;ible to be &s;een that is fine and rich, according to
the fa&s;hion of the Country; among&s;t other things, there were
&s;ix of a certain &s;ort of clo&s;e Coat of Gold and Silver Brocard,
made like Ve&s;ts to wear in a Morning, with buttons, &s;ome of
Diamonds, and others of Emralds, and of the&s;e every one had
&s;ix dozen. The Linnen and the Lace were not inferiour to the
re&s;t. She &s;hewed me her Jewels al&s;o, which were admirable,
but &s;o ill &s;et, that the bigge&s;t there made no better a &s;hew than
a Jewel &s;et in <HI>Paris,</HI> which one might buy for thirty <HI>Lew</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I will not write to you often, becau&s;e I will always have a
&s;tock of News to tell you, which in this place, is pretty long
in picking up. Pardon this tedious Letter, and the little Me|thod
which I have ob&s;erv'd in it; I &s;et things down ju&s;t as
they come into my Mind, and that's ill enough; but in your
Love, dear Co&s;in, I am &s;afe from all my faults.</P>

<P>I Fear you'll take it ill that I have omitted writing to you one
Po&s;t; but dear Cou&s;in, I was willing to be inform'd of di|vers
things, which I am now going to relate.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, I will &s;peak of the Churches of <HI>Madrid,</HI> which I
find extream beautiful and neat: The Women of Quality &s;el|dom
go to them, becau&s;e they all have their Chappels in their
Hou&s;es; but there are certain days in the
year, they never fail to be at them, of which
number are all the days in the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion-week;</HI>
and there al&s;o they make their<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="marg">Go to receive their Indulgences.</NOTE> <HI>Stations,</HI>
and &s;ometimes go to Confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="153">
Our Ladies Church of <HI>Atocha,</HI> that is to &s;ay, our Lady of the
<HI>Bu&s;h,</HI> is indeed a very fine one. It &s;tands within a va&s;t <HI>Con|vent,</HI>
which is fill'd with <HI>Religious</HI> Women, who &s;eldom or ne|ver
go out of it, that being one of their Rules they are to ob|&s;erve.
They lead an au&s;tere Life; and from all parts, People
come to pay their Devotion here; and when the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI>
have gain'd any Victories or happy Succe&s;s, thither they go to
&s;ing <HI>Te Deum.</HI> There you'll &s;ee a <HI>Virgin</HI> holding a young <HI>Je|&s;us,</HI>
which they report to be miraculous. She's of a black
Complexion, and very often they dre&s;s her up like a Widow;
but upon great Fe&s;tivals &s;he is richly cloathed, and &s;o adorn'd
with Jewels, that nothing can be &s;een more magnificent. She
hath in a particular manner the Sun drawn round her Head,
who&s;e Beams &s;hine admirably. She always has a va&s;t pair of
Beads either in her Hand, or hung at her Girdle. This Chap|pel
is on one &s;ide of the Body of the Church, and in &s;uch a
place, as it would be very dark, were it not that there's con|tinually
burning above an hundred great Lamps of Gold and
Silver. The King has his Gallery there, who&s;e fore-part is
made up with a Lattice Window. In all their Churches they
make u&s;e of Ha&s;&s;ocks to kneel on; and when a Per&s;on of Qua|lity,
or a &s;trange Lady comes in, the Sexton &s;preads a large
Carpet before 'em, upon which he either &s;ets an Oratory with
Cu&s;hions, or el&s;e he leads 'em to certain little Clo&s;ets, all painted
and gilt, with Gla&s;s-windows round, where one is very conve|niently
placed. There never fails a Sunday that the Altar is not
illuminated with above an hundred thick Wax Candles. It is
likewi&s;e adorn'd with a prodigious quantity of Plate, and &s;o
are all the Churches in <HI>Madrid.</HI> Here are abundance of fine
Walks made of your green Turf; and &s;et full of Flowers, in
which they place a great many Fountains, from whence the
Water falls into Ba&s;ins, either of Silver, or Marble, or Porphi|ry
&s;tone. Round about them they plant great numbers of
Orange-Trees, as high as a Man, and the&s;e are &s;et in very fine
Boxes; and among the&s;e they turn loo&s;e &s;everal Birds, which
make a pretty &s;ort of Mu&s;ick. And this as I have de&s;cribed to
you, la&s;ts almo&s;t all the year, neither are their Churches ever
without Orange or Je&s;&s;amin Trees, which perfume them much
better than their Incen&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Chappel which they call our Lords of <HI>Almunada,</HI> you
&s;ee a <HI>Virgin,</HI> which they tell ye St. <HI>James</HI> brought from <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI>
and hid in a Tower which is in the middle of <HI>Madrid.</HI>
The <HI>Moors</HI> having be&s;ieg'd the City, the Inhabitants were redu|ced
to &s;o great a want of Provi&s;ions, that they were delibera|ting
<PB N="151" REF="154">
to Surrender, when on a &s;udden they found this Tower
full of Corn; they concluded &s;uch a plentiful and &s;ea&s;onable
Supply could be no le&s;s than the effect of a Miracle; this fill'd
them with Joy and new Courage, and made them &s;o vigo|rou&s;ly
defend the City, that the <HI>Moors</HI> toyl'd with a long Siege,
were force to retire. Afterwards they found the Image of
the <HI>Virgin,</HI> and in gratitude, they built a Chapel for her, upon
the Walls of which, this whole Hi&s;tory is painted in <HI>Fre&s;co.</HI> The
Altar, Rayles, and all the Lamps are of &s;olid Silver.</P>
<P>The <HI>Minime</HI> Fryars have a Church near this, in which is the
Chappel of our <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Soledad,</HI> where the <HI>Salutation</HI> is every
night &s;aid; this is a place of great Devotion; I mean for tho&s;e
that are truly devout, for there are a great many Per&s;ons which
make it their Rendezvouz for other ends.</P>
<P>But St. <HI>I&s;idore</HI>'s Chappel &s;urpa&s;&s;es all in beauty. He is the
Patron of <HI>Madrid,</HI> and he was but a poor Labourer. The Walls
of the Chappel are all ca&s;ed with Marble of divers Colours, and
its Pillars are of the &s;ame, and &s;o are &s;ome Statues of certain
Saints: This Tomb is in the middle, and four Pillars of Porphi|ry
&s;upports over it a Crown cut in Marble, in which are repre|&s;ented
Flowers, who&s;e Colours are &s;o very natural, that one may
&s;ay, Art has outdone Nature. The <HI>Cupulo,</HI> without is adorned
with the Images of the Twelve Apo&s;tles, which &s;tand round
it.</P>
<P>I &s;aw at St. <HI>Seba&s;tines,</HI> (which at pre&s;ent is my Pari&s;h) a
Canopy which the Queen-Mother caus'd to be made, for the
carrying the holy Sacrament to the Sick in bad Weather: It is
made of Crim&s;on Velvet embroider'd with Gold, it is cover'd
with Chagrin, and nail'd with Gold Nails; it has &s;everal great
Gla&s;&s;es about it, and in the middle of its roof, there is rais'd a
&s;ort of Steeple, which is full of little Bells of Gold, Four Prie&s;ts
carry it when any Per&s;on of Quality is &s;ick, and de&s;ires to re|ceive
the Sacrament, and all the People at Court attend it.
There are about a thou&s;and Flamboys of white Wax to give
Light, and &s;everal mu&s;ical In&s;truments play before it. They
make &s;ome &s;tay at all the great Places in their way, to give
leave to the People to kneel and receive the Benediction, and
to let the Mu&s;icians play upon their Harps and Guittars, and
&s;ing to them. It is generally in the Night-time that they car|ry
it with &s;o much Ceremony and Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>When they are to celebrate a Fe&s;tival in &s;ome Church, the
Evening before they &s;et up a long Pole fa&s;tned in the Ground,
on the top of which is a kind of a deep Chaffing-di&s;h, which
they fill with wooden Chips mixt with Brim&s;tone and Oyl:
<PB N="152" REF="155">
This burns a long while, and gives a very great Light; they
place the&s;e Poles in the form of Allies, which make a delight|ful
&s;ort of an Illumination.</P>
<P>The Women which go abroad to <HI>Ma&s;s,</HI> hear a dozen of them,
but &s;hew &s;o much Di&s;traction and wandring of Thoughts, that
one may ea&s;ily perceive their Minds are employ'd on &s;ome other
thing than their Prayers. They wear Muffs that are above half
an Ell long; they are made of the fine&s;t Martins and Sables
which can be &s;een, and are worth 4 or 5 hundred Crowns a|piece.
They mu&s;t &s;tretch back their Arms as far as po&s;&s;ible they
can, to be able only to put their fingers ends into the entrance
of their Muffs. I fancy, I have already told you that the Wo|men
are extream little, and the&s;e Muffs are very little le&s;s than
them&s;elves. They always wear a $an too, and be it in Summer
or Winter, they never cea&s;e fanning them&s;elves all the time of
<HI>Ma&s;s.</HI> In the Church they all &s;it upon their Legs, and are con|tinually
taking of Snuff, and yet never &s;mut them&s;elves with it,
as 'tis u&s;ual; for in this, as in all other things, they have very
neat and dexterous ways of management. Every time the <HI>Ele|vation</HI>
is made, both the Women and Men give them&s;elves a
&s;core of blows with their fifts upon their Brea&s;ts, which makes
&s;uch a noi&s;e, that the fir&s;t time I heard it, I was very much
$ffrighted, and thought they were beating one another.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Cavalleros,</HI> (I mean tho&s;e which by Profe&s;&s;ion are
Gallants, and wear a piece of Crape round their Hats) as &s;oon
as <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> is ended, they march up to the place where the <HI>Holy
Water</HI> is kept, and ranging them&s;elves round it, they pre&s;ent
of it to all the Ladies, who al&s;o come thither, and at the &s;ame
time &s;ay &s;omething to them that's kind; to which the Women
make a pertinent an&s;wer in few words; for it mu&s;t needs be
granted, that they &s;peak preci&s;ely what they &s;hould, and that <HI>ex|tempore,</HI>
without any trouble of &s;tudying for words. But the
<HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Nunci$,</HI> has upon pain of Excommunication, forbid the
Men to pre&s;ent the Women any <HI>Holy Water.</HI> And 'tis &s;aid, that
this Prohibition was obtained at the Intreaty of &s;ome jea|lous
Husbands. However it be, it is ob&s;erved, and they &s;ay,
the Prohibition even forbids the Men to give each other any
<HI>Holy Water.</HI></P>
<P>Let the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women be of what Quality they will, they
neither have Cu&s;hions, in the Church, nor any kind of Train
held up. For our parts, as &s;oon as we appear there in our
<HI>French</HI> Cloaths, every body gets round about us; but the mo&s;t
trouble&s;ome of all, are the big belly'd Women, which are more
inqui&s;itive than the others, and for whom they have here, the
<PB N="153" REF="156">
greate&s;t re&s;pect and complai&s;ance; for 'tis pretended, that if
they long for any thing, and mi&s;s of it, they receive &s;o much
hurt that they immediately mi&s;carry; &s;o that they have a li|berty
to pull off ones Gloves, and to tugg, hale, and examine
every body as they li&s;t.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, I could not take &s;uch kind of Je&s;ting, and talkt to
them &s;o roughly, that &s;ome of them went away weeping, and
dur&s;t not return: But there were others which were not &s;o ea|&s;ily
put out of Countenance; they would &s;ee my Shooes, my
Garters, and what I had in my Pocket; my Kin&s;women &s;eeing
I would not permit them, told me that if the People once took
notice of me they would certainly &s;tone us, and bid me let
them have their humour. My Women and Chamber maids were
yet wor&s;e tormented than I; and I am a&s;ham'd to tell you,
how far the curio&s;ity of the&s;e big-belly'd Woman proceeded.</P>
<P>I was told that there was a young man at Court, who was
de&s;perately in love with a very fine Woman, who&s;e Husband
continually kept her under his Eyes, &s;o that finding no other way
to &s;peak to her, he di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf like a Woman big with
Child, and &s;o went to her Hou&s;e; he addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to the
jealous Husband, and told him, he had the <HI>Lantajo</HI> (which is
the word for Longing) to di&s;cour&s;e with his Wife in private.
The Husband deceiv'd by this appearance, made no que&s;tion
that this was a young big belly'd Woman, and immediately
con&s;ented that his Wife &s;hould make this Per&s;on happy with a
long and plea&s;ant audience.</P>
<P>When any of the&s;e Women long to &s;ee the King, they give
him notice of it, and he has the Goodne&s;s to come into a great
Balcon, which looks into the Palace Court, and there he tarries
as long as they de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Not long &s;ince a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Woman ju&s;t come from <HI>Naples,</HI> &s;ent
to beg the King that &s;he might &s;ee him, and when &s;he had
lookt upon him as long as &s;he had a mind in a tran&s;port of Zeal,
with hands lifted up, &s;he &s;aid to him, <HI>I be&s;eech God, Sir, that
of his Mercy, he would one day make you Vice-Roy of Naples.</HI> 'Tis
&s;aid, that this Pa&s;&s;age was acted before the King, to inform us
that the Magnificence of the then <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> who was not be|loved
far exceeded his. Very frequently there comes into my
Relation's Hou&s;e, Women which are perfect Strangers, to
whom neverthele&s;s &s;he is very kind and civil, becau&s;e they are
big with Child, and &s;uch we mu&s;t not vex.</P>
<P>Thanks to Heaven, Lent is over, and though I only ob&s;erv'd
the Pa&s;&s;ion-Week, yet that was more tedious to me, then a
whole Lent kept at <HI>Paris,</HI> for there's no Butter here; that little
<PB N="154" REF="157">
which one meets with, is brought about Thirty Leagues off,
wrapt up like Sau&s;ages in Hogs Bladders. It is full of Worms,
and very dear. But the Oyl makes amends, for 'tis very ex|cellent;
only you know, every body loves it not, and I am
one of tho&s;e, which cannot eat it, without being very &s;ick.</P>
<P>That which makes it yet wor&s;e here, is, that Fi&s;h is very
&s;carce; it is impo&s;&s;ible to have any &s;weet which is caught in the
Sea, for that is di&s;tant from <HI>Madrid</HI> above Four&s;core Leagues.
Sometimes there is a Salmon brought, of which they make Pies,
which being &s;ea&s;on'd with Spice and Saffron, is eatable. There's
very little Fre&s;h water Fi&s;h, and yet for all this, they do not
&s;uffer much Inconvenience, for indeed, there's hardly any body
keeps Lent, neither Ma&s;ter nor Servant, becau&s;e of the great
want of Provi&s;ions. They take a Licen&s;e from the Pope's <HI>Nun|cio,</HI>
which co&s;ts about a Shilling, which gives them leave to eat
Butter and Chee&s;e all <HI>Lent,</HI> and the Heads, Feet, and Inwards
of Fowl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> every Saturday throughout the Year. And it
&s;eems to me pretty odd, that on this day they &s;hould eat the
Feet, Head, and Inwards, and yet dare not eat of any other
part of the &s;ame Creature.</P>
<P>The Shambles are as open in <HI>Lent,</HI> as they are in the <HI>Carna|val.</HI>
Their way of &s;elling Meat is very trouble&s;ome; it is clo&s;e
&s;hut up in the Butcher's Shop, one &s;peaks to him through a
little Window, and de&s;ires of to buy him half a Calf, or the
like; he neither vouch&s;afes to an&s;wer you, nor to &s;hew you the
lea&s;t bit of Meat; at la&s;t, you are content with a Loyn of Veal;
but he makes you pay your Money down before-hand, and then
through his little Window he gives you a Leg Mutton; you
return it, and tell him, this is not what you ask for; he takes
it again, and in&s;tead thereof he gives you a &s;hort Rib of Beef;
then you make a noi&s;e for your Loyn, but he concerns him&s;elf
no further than to throw you your Money, and &s;hut the Win|dow
upon you. This vexes one, and you go to another, and
he treats you after the &s;ame manner, if not wor&s;e; &s;o that it is
be&s;t, to tell them how much Meat you would have, and leave
the re&s;t to them. The Fle&s;h is ill for the Stomach, it is &s;o
lean, dry, and black; but as bad as 'tis, yet there's le&s;s requir'd
of it than of ours in <HI>France,</HI> to make good Soup. Every thing
here nouri&s;hes &s;o extreamly, that an Egg does one more good
than a Pigeon el&s;ewhere; and this I take to be an Effect of the
Climate.</P>
<P>As to their Wine, it does not plea&s;e me; this is not the Coun|try
where the Excellent <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wine is drank, that comes from
<HI>Andalou&s;ia</HI> and the <HI>Canary-I&s;lands,</HI> which mu&s;t pa&s;s the Sea too,
<PB N="155" REF="158">
to gain that &s;trength and plea&s;antne&s;s which we find in it. At
<HI>Madrid</HI> the Wine is &s;trong enough, if not too &s;trong, but it
wants that delicious Ta&s;te. Add to this, that they keep it in
Bags made of Buck-skin, and fitted up for that purpo&s;e, &s;o that
it always &s;mells and ta&s;tes either of Pitch, or as if it was burnt.
I now begin not to wonder that Men are &s;o temperate with
&s;uch Liquor. They'll &s;ell as little a quantity of it as one will, even
to the value of a <HI>French Double:</HI> But that which is &s;o retail'd out
to the poor People, is yet made wor&s;e than it would be, by their
letting it &s;tand all day in an open Earthen Ba&s;on, out of which
they &s;ell to tho&s;e who have a mind. It grows &s;our, and &s;mells
&s;o &s;trong, that it make one's Head ake in pa&s;&s;ing by.</P>
<P>Lent makes no alteration in their Plea&s;ures, indeed they are
&s;o moderate, or at lea&s;t tho&s;e they u&s;e make &s;o little noi&s;e, that
they enjoy them at all times.</P>
<P>No body fails of going to their <HI>Station</HI> in Pa&s;&s;ion-week, but
particularly from Wedne&s;day to Friday. In the&s;e three days,
there is acted very different things, by real <HI>Penitents, Lovers,</HI>
and <HI>Hypocrites.</HI> There are divers Women, which under pre|tence
of Devotion, con&s;tantly go to certain Churches, where
for a Year before, they are a&s;&s;ur'd to meet him they Love;
and though they are attended with &s;everal of their Women,
which they call <HI>Duennas,</HI> yet as the Crowds are great, and Love
makes them ingenious, &s;o they make a &s;hift in &s;pight of all the
<HI>Argus</HI>'s, to &s;lip on one &s;ide into a little adjoyning Hou&s;e, which
by a private &s;ign they know, and is hired for that purpo&s;e, and
without the help of any body, but at that very moment of time.
When they have done, they return to the &s;ame Church, where
they find their Women bu&s;ie in &s;earching for them; they fall a
chiding them for their carele&s;ne&s;s in lo&s;ing them; and thus the
Husband, who for a whole Year hath indu&s;triou&s;ly watch'd his
dear Wife, lo&s;es her at that very &s;ea&s;on when &s;he is obilged to
be the mo&s;t faithful to him: The great Con&s;traint they live
under, put violent de&s;ires in them to enjoy &s;ome freedom, and
their very Amorous Nature makes them Witty to find out means
to bring about their De&s;igns.</P>
<P>'Tis an unplea&s;ant thing to &s;ee the <HI>Di&s;ciplinarians:</HI> The fir&s;t
time I met one of them I thought I &s;hould have &s;wooned a|way.
The unexpectedne&s;s of &s;uch a terrible &s;ight &s;eized me;
fancy a Man coming &s;o near you, that he'll cover you all over
with his Blood; this, it &s;eems, is one of their Pa&s;times: there
are certain Rules by which to Di&s;cipline them&s;elves hand&s;omly,
and Ma&s;ters to teach the Art, ju&s;t as to Dance and to Fence.
They have a &s;ort of a Gown made of their <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> Cloth very
<PB N="156" REF="159">
fine, which comes down to their Shooes; it is laid in &s;mall
plights, and &s;o prodigiou&s;ly wide, that it contains at lea&s;t fifty
Ells of Cloth. They wear upon their Heads a Cap three times
higher than a Sugar-loaf, and of the &s;ame Shape: It is cover'd
with Holland, and from it falls a great piece of Cloth which
hides all the Face and the forepart of the Body; there's two
little holes in't to &s;ee through: On the back of their Wa&s;tcoats
they have two great holes upon their &s;houlders; they wear
white Gloves and Shooes, and abundance of Ribbon which tyes
their Wa&s;tcoat-&s;leeves, but hanging down, and not in knots.
They al&s;o tye one to their Whip; commonly 'tis their Mi&s;tre&s;s
which honours them with this Favour: And to be the more
admired, they mu&s;t not lift up their Arms, only the Wri&s;t and
the Hand, and the blows mu&s;t not follow ha&s;tily, nor the
Blood which runs out &s;poil their Cloaths. They give them|&s;elves
mo&s;t terrible cuts and &s;la&s;hes upon their Shoulders, from
whence runs &s;treams of Blood. They walk &s;o &s;oftly in the
Streets as if they counted their &s;teps; they pre&s;ent them&s;elves
before their Mi&s;tre&s;s's Window, and there with wonderful pa|tience
la&s;h them&s;elves. The Lady through the Lettice of her
Chamber &s;ees this fine &s;ight, and by &s;ome &s;ign encourages her
Gallant to flea him&s;elf alive, and lets him know how very kind|ly
&s;he takes this Action of his. When they meet a hand&s;ome
Woman, they whip them&s;elves after &s;uch a rate, as to make
the Blood flie upon her: This is e&s;teemed a particular Civility,
and the Lady acknowledges and thanks them for it. When once
they have begun to give them&s;elves this Di&s;cipline, the pre&s;er|vation
of their Health obliges them afterwards to u&s;e it every
Year, otherwi&s;e they would be &s;ick. They have al&s;o little
Needles &s;tuck in Sponges, with which they prick their Shoul|ders
and their &s;ides &s;o eagerly, as if it did not hurt them. But
I'll tell you &s;omething yet &s;tranger. Several Courtiers often
take this Walk in the Night: But they are commonly the
young Fools, and they give notice to all their Friends of their
De&s;ign, who immediately come to them very well arm'd. The
Marque&s;s <HI>De Villa Hermo&s;a</HI> was one of them this Year, and the
Duke <HI>De Vejar</HI> was the other. This Duke went out of his
Hou&s;e about Nine a Clock at Night, he had a hundred Flam|boys
of White Wax carry'd before him, two by two. Three|&s;core
of his Friends went before, and a hundred follow'd after
him, and every one had his Page and Footmen; and it was a
very long Proce&s;&s;ion. It is known when Men of this Quality
are to walk; &s;o that all the Ladies are in their Windows, and
hang out their Carpets in their Balconies; and that they may
<PB N="157" REF="160">
the better &s;ee and be &s;een, they have Flamboys fa&s;tned to the
&s;ides. The <HI>Knight of Di&s;cipline</HI> with his Guard, pa&s;&s;es along
and &s;alutes the Spectators. But that which often cau&s;es a great
deal of Mi&s;chief, is, when the other <HI>Di&s;ciplinarian,</HI> who &s;tands
upon his Honour and Reputation, marches with his great Com|pany
in the &s;ame Street. This happened to the&s;e Per&s;ons I
have now mentioned. Each of them would have the upper
hand, and neither would yield it. The Footmen with their
Flamboys began to lay one another over the Faces, and burn
their Wiskers and Hair; the Friends of each Party drew their
Swords again&s;t one another. Our two <HI>Heroes</HI> who were only
Armed with this In&s;trument of Penance, &s;earch for each other,
and being met, begin a mo&s;t terrible Battel. After they have
u&s;ed a little Di&s;cipline about one anothers Ears, and covered the
Ground with the ends of their Whip-cords, they fall down|right
Fifty-cuffs like any Porters: Though after all, there's but
little matter to laugh at in this piece of Mummery, for they
beat one another well favouredly; they wound, and often
kill; and here old Enmities revive and are revenged. But at
la&s;t, the Duke <HI>de Vejar</HI> yielded to the Marque&s;s <HI>De Villa Hermo|&s;a,</HI>
they gathered up their broken Whips, and mended them
as well as they could: The great Cap, which was thrown into
the <HI>Canal,</HI> was wiped and put upon the <HI>Penitent</HI>'s Head again;
the wounded were carried home, and the Proce&s;&s;ion began a|gain,
and they walked more gravely than ever, through a great
part of the City.</P>
<P>The <HI>Duke</HI> had a great mind the next Morning to be revenged,
but the <HI>King</HI> commanded both him and the <HI>Marque&s;s</HI> not to &s;tir
out of their Hou&s;es. But to come to what they do upon the&s;e
Occa&s;ions: You mu&s;t know, that after the&s;e Servants of <HI>God</HI>
are returned home, there's a magnificent Supper prepared of all
&s;orts of Meats; and ob&s;erve that this is on the la&s;t day of <HI>Pa&s;|&s;ion
Week.</HI> But after &s;o good a Work, they think they may do
a little Evil. Immediately the <HI>Penitent</HI> cau&s;es his &s;houlders
to be a long time rubbed with Sponges dipt in Vinegar and Salt,
le&s;t there &s;hould remain any brui&s;ed Blood, after that, he &s;ets
him&s;elf at the Table with his Friends, and receives from them
the Elogies and Applau&s;es which he believes he has merited.
Every one in his turn, tells him, that in the Memory of Man,
none was ever &s;een to receive the Di&s;cipline with &s;o good a
grace. They magnifie all his Actions, but above all, the Hap|pine&s;s
of that Lady for who&s;e &s;ake all this Bravery was per|formed.
The whole Night is &s;pent in &s;uch kind of Di&s;cour&s;e,
and &s;ometimes he that has been &s;o well flogged, is &s;o &s;ick, that
<PB N="158" REF="161">
he cannot go to <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> on <HI>Ea&s;ter-day.</HI> Do not think that I u&s;e
any Art to &s;et out the Hi&s;tory of this matter to make you merry,
it is all literally true, and I tell you nothing, which you may not
be &s;atisfied in, from every body that has been at <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>But there are al&s;o true <HI>Penitents,</HI> which indeed troubles one
extreamly to look on them, they are dre&s;t ju&s;t as tho&s;e who
give them&s;elves the <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> except that they are naked from
the &s;houlders to the middle, and with a kind of a narrow Matt
are &s;wadled and bound &s;o very hard, that all the Fle&s;h which
appears is black and blew, their Arms &s;tretched out, are wrapt
about with the &s;ame Matt. They carry to the number of &s;even
Swords &s;ticking in their Backs and Arms, which hurt them
grievou&s;ly when they &s;tir too much, or happen to fall, which
they often do, for they going bare-foot, and the Stones in the
Streets being &s;harp, and cutting their Feet, they cannot po&s;&s;i|bly
always keep them&s;elves up. There are others, who in&s;tead
of the&s;e Swords carry Cro&s;&s;es &s;o very heavy, that they are even
born down with them, neither would I have you think that
the&s;e are of the ordinary People, &s;ome of them are of the high|e&s;t
Quality. They are forced to have &s;everal of their Servants
to accompany them, but they are di&s;gui&s;ed, and their Faces co|vered,
le&s;t they &s;hould be known. The&s;e carry Wine, Vine|gar,
and other things, to give their Ma&s;ter from time to time,
who very frequently drop down dead with the extream pain
and toil they endure. Generally the&s;e <HI>Penances</HI> are enjoyned
by their Confe&s;&s;ors, and they are &s;o very &s;evere, that he which
undergoes them &s;eldom out-lives the Year. The Popes <HI>Nuncio</HI>
told me that he had forbid all <HI>Confe&s;&s;ors</HI> to impo&s;e them, yet I
have &s;een divers, though in likelihood it proceeded from their
own Devotion.</P>
<P>From the beginning of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion-Week</HI> to <HI>Low-Sunday,</HI> one can|not
&s;tir out of Doors without &s;eeing an infinite number of <HI>Peni|tents</HI>
of all &s;orts, and on <HI>Good-Friday</HI> they all come to the <HI>Pro|ce&s;&s;ion,</HI>
which is but one general one for all the City, and is
compo&s;ed of all the <HI>Pari&s;hes</HI> and <HI>Convents.</HI> Upon this day, the
Ladies are more finely dre&s;&s;ed than on their Wedding-days;
they place them&s;elves in their Balconies, which are &s;et out with
rich Carpets and Cu&s;hions. Sometimes there's above an hundred
Women together. The Proce&s;&s;ion begins about four a Clock,
and is not ended till pa&s;t eight; for I cannot expre&s;s to you
the numberle&s;s Number of People I have &s;een, counting from
the <HI>King, Don John,</HI> the <HI>Cardinals, Emba&s;&s;adors,</HI> the <HI>Grandees,</HI>
the <HI>Courtezans,</HI> to all &s;orts of Folks, both of the Court and City.
Every one holds a Wax Candle in his Hand, and all their Ser|vants,
<PB N="159" REF="162">
which are numerous, carry Torches and Flamboys. In
their <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion,</HI> all their Banners and Cro&s;&s;es are covered with
Crape, and there's a va&s;t number of Drums covered with the
&s;ame, and they beat, as at the Death of a General. The Trum|pets
&s;ound &s;ome melancholy Tune. The <HI>King</HI>'s Guards, which
are four Companies of different Nations, to wit, <HI>Burgundians,
Spaniards, Germans,</HI> and <HI>L'Ancillians,</HI> have their Arms covered
with Mourning, and trail them upon the ground. There are
certain Machins &s;et upon Theatres, which repre&s;ent the My|&s;teries
of the Life and Death of our Lord; the Figures are as
big as Life, but very ill made and dre&s;t: There are &s;ome &s;o
heavy, that a hundred Men can but lift them, of which there's
a va&s;t number, for every Pari&s;h has &s;ome. I ob&s;erved that of
the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Virgin</HI> flying into <HI>Egypt,</HI> &s;he was upon an A&s;s which
had good Furniture; the Hou&s;ing was all over embroidered
with fine Pearls, the Figure was very great and heavy.</P>
<P>Here they are afraid le&s;t &s;ometimes the People &s;hould fail in
their Devotion at <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> and therefore for that rea&s;on, each
Pari&s;h-Prie&s;t goes to every Hou&s;e, and enquires of the Ma&s;ter,
how many Communicants he has? Being informed, he notes
the Number in his Book: To every one that has received the
Communion, they give a Printed Certificate. After <HI>Low-Sunday</HI>
they vi&s;it all the Hou&s;es again, and demand to &s;ee the Certifi|cates,
which they ought to have according to the fir&s;t Account
taken of them, and if they can &s;hew none, there's a &s;trict en|quiry
made after him or her who has not Communicated. At
this time the Poor who are &s;ick, hang out a Carpet at their
Door, and the Sacrament is brought to them in a very fine and
Devout Proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Since my being at <HI>Madrid,</HI> I have &s;een very few &s;tately Fu|nerals,
except one for the Duke de <HI>Medina Celi</HI>'s Daughter. Her
Coffin was made of rare <HI>Indian</HI> Wood, put into a blue Velvet
Bag and cro&s;t with Silver Mohair with Cords of Silver Thread,
and the Strings were of the &s;ame, and fa&s;tned the Bag at each
end, like a &s;tuff Cloak-bag. The Coffin was in a Hear&s;e co|vered
with white Velvet, &s;et round with Garlands and Coronets
curiou&s;ly made of Flowers. And thus they carried her to <HI>Me|dina
Celi,</HI> the Capital City of the Dutchy of that Name.</P>
<P>Commonly they dre&s;s up the dead in the habit of &s;ome <HI>Re|ligious
Order,</HI> and carry them all bare-faced into the Church
where they are to be buryed. If it is a Woman, they put her
on the habit of the <HI>Carmelites.</HI> This Order is in great Vene|ration
here; the Prince&s;&s;es of the Blood retire to their Convent.
The Queens them&s;elves, when they are Widows, are obliged
<PB N="160" REF="163">
to &s;pend the re&s;t of their Life there, unle&s;s the King otherwi&s;e
appointed before his Death, as <HI>Philip</HI> IV. did in favour of
Queen <HI>Mary Ann</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> his Wife. And in ca&s;e a Queen is
Divorced, &s;he mu&s;t go into a <HI>Religious Hou&s;e;</HI> for Divorced or
Widow, &s;he has not the Liberty to marry again.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> pre&s;ume &s;o much above other <HI>Kings,</HI> that
they will not endure a <HI>Prince&s;s</HI> who has once been their Wife,
&s;hould ever be &s;o to another, let her have the greate&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion
in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Don John</HI> hath a natural Daughter, a profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Carmelite</HI> at
<HI>Madrid.</HI> She is wonderful hand&s;ome, and 'tis &s;aid &s;he had no
mind to take the Habit; but 'twas her Fate, as 'tis of divers o|thers
of her Quality, who like it no more than &s;he.</P>
<P>They call them the <HI>De$calcas Reales,</HI> which is to &s;ay, <HI>The
Royal-barefeet.</HI> This reaches even to the King's Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es,
whether they be unmarried or Widows, when he can love them
no longer, they mu&s;t turn <HI>Nuns.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;ome of the Works of St. <HI>There&s;a,</HI> writ with her
own Hand, the Character is Legible, large, and indifferent fair.
<HI>Donna Beatrix Carillo,</HI> who is her Neece's Neece, keeps them
very choicely. It was &s;he that &s;hewed them to me. They con|&s;i&s;t
of a Collection of Letters, I do not believe they were ever
Printed; there's a great deal of Perfection in them, and through|out
one may di&s;cover a certain air of chearfulne&s;s and &s;weet|ne&s;s
of Nature, which &s;ufficiently declares the Character of that
great Saint.</P>
<P>All the time of <HI>Lent,</HI> and even at other times, one meets with
Preachers at every corner of a &s;treet, who&s;e Sermons are ill
enough contrived, and do as little good, but however, in prea|ching
as they do, they both &s;atisfie their zeal and their de&s;ire.
Their mo&s;t con&s;tant Auditors are the blind Folks, which re&s;em|ble
our &s;ingers upon <HI>Pont-Neuf.</HI> Every one of them being led
by a little Dog which does it very well, they go about &s;inging
of <HI>Romances</HI> and <HI>Cacara,</HI> which are certain old Stories or Mo|dern
Events, which the People are very glad to know. They
have a little D$um, and a Flute, on which they play. They of|ten
&s;ing a S$ng on King <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t, it beginning, <HI>When
the King left</HI> France, <HI>to his Sorrow he left it,</HI> &amp;c. Now, I doubt
you know it, dear Co&s;en, for who does not: This song is
&s;ung in very had <HI>French,</HI> and by Folks that do not under&s;tand
one word of it. All that they under&s;tand is, That the King
was taken by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and as this Prince was much for
their Glory, &s;o they are willing to convey the Memory of it
down to Po&s;terity. There's a <HI>Flower de-Luce</HI> all gilt upon the
<PB N="161" REF="164">
roof of the Chamber where this King was Pri&s;oner; and I mu&s;t
not omit telling you, that the Pri&s;on is one of the faire&s;t Buil|dings
in <HI>Madrid,</HI> the Windows are as large as tho&s;e of other
Hou&s;es. There are indeed Iron Bars, but they are all gilt, and
&s;et at a di&s;tance great enough, to make any one think they
were not de&s;igned to hinder e&s;capes. I &s;tood amazed at the
&s;eeming neatne&s;s of a Place which in reality is unplea&s;ant e|nough,
and I thought that in <HI>Spain,</HI> they had a mind to con|tradict
the <HI>French</HI> Proverb, which &s;ays, <HI>That there's neither any
hand&s;ome Pri&s;on, nor ugly Love.</HI> Pardon this Proverb, I do not
love them &s;o well to trouble you often with them.</P>
<P>All the Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff one &s;ees here, is extream rich, but not
&s;o neatly made as ours in <HI>France,</HI> and they come altogether &s;hort
of our skill. It con&s;i&s;ts of Tape&s;try, Cabinet, Paintings,
Looking Gla&s;&s;es, and Plate. The <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> and the
Governours of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> have had mo&s;t admirable
Tapi&s;try&punc; the <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Sardinia,</HI> &s;hew mo&s;t ex|cellent
Embroideries and Statues, tho&s;e of the <HI>Indies,</HI> Precious
Stones, and Ve&s;&s;els of Gold and Silver. So that &s;everal return|ing
home from time to time, laden with the Riches of another
Kingdom, cannot chu&s;e but to have enriched this City with abun|dance
of valuable things.</P>
<P>They change their Furniture &s;everal times a year; their
Winter-beds are of Velvet trimed with thick Galoons of Gold,
but they are &s;o low, and the Valens &s;o deep, that one is as if
they were buryed in them; and when one is in Bed, the border
of the Valens lying almo&s;t upon the Counterpain, one can hard|ly
be &s;een. In Summer they have neither Curtains, nor any
thing el&s;e about the Bed, this looks very ill. Sometimes they
hang coloured Gauze to keep off the Gnats.</P>
<P>In Winter they have their Apartments very high, &s;ome|times
in the fourth Story, according as the cold encrea&s;es, to
keep them from it. At pre&s;ent they u&s;e their Summer Lodg|ings,
which are low and very commodious. All their Hou&s;es
have a great many Rooms on a floor; you go through a dozen
or fifteen Parlours or Chambers one after another. Tho&s;e which
are the wor&s;t lodged have &s;ix or &s;even, the Rooms are general|ly
longer than they are broad, the Floors and Seilings are nei|ther
painted, nor gilt, they are made of Plai&s;ter quite plain,
but &s;o white that they dazle ones Eyes, for every year they are
&s;crapt, and whited as the Walls, which look like Marble, they
are &s;o well poli&s;ht. The Court to their Summer Apartments
is made of certain matter, which after it has had ten Pails of
<PB N="162" REF="165">
Water thrown upon it, yet is dry in half an hour after, and
leaves a plea&s;ant coolne&s;s, &s;o that in the Morning they water
all, and a little while after, they &s;pread Matts or Carpets made
of very fine Ru&s;hes which cover all the Pavement. The whole
Apartments are hung with the &s;ame &s;mall Matt about the
depth of an Ell, to hinder the coldne&s;s of the Walls from hur|ting
tho&s;e which lean again&s;t them. On the top of the&s;e
Matts, there are hung Pictures and Looking-Gla&s;&s;es. The
Cu&s;hions which are of Gold and Silver Brocado, are placed up|on
the Carpet, and the Tables and Cabinets are very fine, and
at little di&s;tances there are &s;et Silver Ca&s;es or Boxes, filled with
Orange and Ja&s;&s;amin-Trees. In their Windows they &s;et things
made of Straw, to keep the Sun out, and in the Evenings they
walk in their Gardens. There are &s;everal Hou&s;es which have
very fine ones, where you &s;ee Grotta's and Fountains in abun|dance,
for they have great plenty of Water here, and 'tis very
good. In the number of the&s;e fine Hou&s;es they reckon the
Duke <HI>O&s;&s;ona</HI>'s, that of the Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile's</HI> Lady, the
Counte&s;s of <HI>Ognate,</HI> and the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tile;</HI> but I do
wrong in particularizing of them, for there are a con&s;iderable
number of them.</P>
<P>For the re&s;t, it &s;eems to me, that the great care they take,
prevents the heats (let them be never &s;o exce&s;&s;ive) from being
trouble&s;ome to them. But do not fancy, I be&s;eech ye, that on|ly
the great Lords have their low Apartments, for indeed every
body el&s;e has them according to their Ability; though it be on|ly
a little Cellar they'll live in it contentedly.</P>
<P>There are but few ordinary People at <HI>Madrid,</HI> one &s;eldom
&s;ees any but Per&s;ons of Quality, if &s;even or eight Streets which
are full of Trade&s;men, are excepted. You &s;ee no Shops in this
City, unle&s;s it be tho&s;e where Sweet-meats, Liquors, Ice, and
Pa&s;try are &s;old.</P>
<P>I will not neglect telling you, that a thou&s;and People here,
have their <HI>Canopys,</HI> for without reckoning the Prince&s;s and the
Dukes, the <HI>Tituled</HI> (of which there is a va&s;t number) have theirs
al&s;o. The&s;e <HI>Tituled,</HI> are tho&s;e they call the <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI>
the real <HI>Marqui&s;es,</HI> and the real <HI>Counts.</HI> If there be thirty
Chambers on a floor in a hou&s;e, you &s;hall there &s;ee as many <HI>Ca|nopys.</HI>
My Kin&s;woman has twenty in her Hou&s;e: The King
has made her Marchione&s;s of <HI>Ca&s;tille.</HI> You cannot imagine how
gravely I look under a <HI>Canopy,</HI> particularly when they bring me
my Chocolate; for three or four Pages clothed in black like
Lawyers, &s;erve me upon Knee. This is a Cu&s;tom I had much
<PB N="163" REF="166">
ado to bring my &s;elf to, for methinks this Re&s;pect ought to be
paid to <HI>God</HI> only. But it is &s;o common here, that if a Coblers
Prentice &s;hould pre&s;ent an old Shooe to his Ma&s;ter, he mu&s;t do
it with knee upon the Ground. This quality of <HI>Titulos</HI> gives
them divers Priviledges of which I have already told you, and
particularly that of having a <HI>Canopy.</HI> They u&s;e no Balli&s;ters a|bout
their Beds.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved to you before, Dear Co&s;en, that our
Hou&s;es are not near &s;o well furni&s;hed in <HI>France,</HI> as the Per|&s;ons
of Quality here are, but chiefly as to Ve&s;&s;els of Silver, the
difference is &s;o very great, that one which had not &s;een it
could hardly believe it: They u&s;e no Ve&s;&s;el of Tin or Pewter,
but either Silver or Earthen-ware only, is what they make u&s;e
of; and you mu&s;t know their Plates here, weigh little le&s;s
than our Di&s;hes in <HI>France,</HI> every thing is made &s;o &s;trangely
heavy.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Alburquerque</HI> dyed &s;ome time ago. I have
been told, that they were &s;ix Weeks in weighing his Ve&s;&s;els
of Gold and Silver, and writing them down; during this time
they employed two whole hours every day; this was very char|geable.
Among&s;t other things, there were fourteen hundred
dozen of Plates, five hundred great Di&s;hes, and &s;even hundred
little ones, and of every thing el&s;e proportionably, there were
al&s;o forty Silver Ladders to &s;et things on the Cup-board, which
was made to a&s;cend by little Steps, like your Altars in a great
Hall. When they told me of &s;uch great Wealth of a particular
Man, I thought they je&s;ted with me, and therefore de&s;ired the
Confirmation of it from <HI>Don Antonio de Toleda&punc;</HI> Son to the Duke
of <HI>Alba,</HI> who was in the &s;ame Hou&s;e; he a&s;&s;ured me it was
very true, and that his Father, who did not e&s;teem him&s;elf
rich in Ve&s;&s;els of Silver, had three hundred dozen of
Silver Plates, and eight hundred Di&s;hes. The migh|ty
Meals which they make do not require &s;uch great &s;tore, un|le&s;s
it be at their Marriages, where every thing is magnificent.
But that which cau&s;es &s;uch great abundance of Ve&s;&s;els, is, that
they are brought from the <HI>Indies</HI> ready made, and pay no Cu|&s;tom
to the King. The truth is, they are little better &s;haped
than their pieces of four <HI>Pi&s;tols,</HI> which they &s;tamp in the
Galleon as they come from that Country.</P>
<P>It would grieve a body to &s;ee the ill management of &s;ome
great Lords, there are divers which will never go to their E|&s;tates
(for &s;o they call their Lands, their Towns and Ca&s;tles)
but pa&s;s all their Lives at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and tru&s;t all to a Steward,
<PB N="164" REF="167">
who makes them believe what he judges mo&s;t for his own Inte|re&s;t.
They will not &s;o much as vouch&s;afe to enquire whether
he &s;peaks true or fal&s;e; this would be too exact, and by con|&s;equence
below them. This methinks is one con&s;iderable fault,
the &s;trange profu&s;ion of Ve&s;&s;els only for an Egg and a Pigeon, is
another.</P>
<P>But it is not only in the&s;e things which they fail, but 'tis al|&s;o
in the daily Expences of their Hou&s;es, they know not what
it is to lay up &s;tores, or make Provi&s;ion of any thing, but eve|ry
day they fetch in what they want, and all upon tru&s;t, at the
Bakers, Cooks, Butchers, and all other Trades; they are even
ignorant what they &s;et down in their Books, and they put
down what price they will for every thing they &s;ell, this mat|ter
is neither examined into, nor contradicted. There are of|ten
fifty Hor&s;es in a Stable, without either Corn or Straw, and
they peri&s;h with Hunger; and when the Ma&s;ter is in Bed,
and &s;hould be taken ill in the Night, he would be at a great
lo&s;s; for they let nothing remain in his Hou&s;e, neither
Wine nor Water, Charcoal nor Wax-Candle, and in a word,
nothing at all; for though they do not take in Provi&s;ions &s;o
near that there is nothing left, yet his Servants have a
Cu&s;tom of carrying the overplus away to their own Lodgings,
and the next day they furni&s;h them&s;elves with the &s;ame things
again.</P>
<P>They ob&s;erve no better Rules with the Trade&s;men, a Man
or Woman of Quality had rather dye, than to haggle for,
or ask the price of a Stuff, or Lace, or any other thing,
or to take the remainder of a piece of Gold; they rather
choo&s;e to give it the Trade&s;man for his pains of having
&s;old them that for ten Pi&s;tols, which was not worth five.
If there is a rea&s;onable price made, he that &s;ells to them
is &s;o hone&s;t not to take the advantage of their ea&s;ine&s;s to give
whatever is askt them; and as they have Credit given them
for ten years together without ever thinking of paying, &s;o at
la&s;t they find them&s;elves under great difficulties with their
Debts.</P>
<P>It is very rare they engage in tedious Suits at Law, or let
things come to extremity, they bring them&s;elves to account,
call their Creditors, and make over to them a certain part of
their Lands, which for a limited time they enjoy. Some|times
they give up every thing, and re&s;erve only a Pen&s;ion
for Life, which cannot be medled with by any Creditors, who
may afterwards &s;ell or lend any thing to them; and to the
<PB N="165" REF="168">
end they be not defrauded of it, they publi&s;h the agreement
between the Lord and his Creditors.</P>
<P>All Law-paper is marked, and co&s;ts more than the other.
There's a certain time when they make a di&s;tribution of
Law-Suits; they give the in&s;tructions at <HI>Madrid,</HI> but there
are few judged there; all the Papers of one &s;ide are put in|to
a Bag, and tho&s;e of the other, into another Bag, and the In|&s;tructions
into a third; and when the time to di&s;tribute the
Law-Suits is come, they &s;end them to &s;ome di&s;tant Parliaments,
&s;o that very often one's Cau&s;e is tryed and judged without
knowing any thing of it. It is writ in a Regi&s;ter whether the
Cau&s;e was &s;ent, which is kept very &s;ecret. When Judgment
is given, it is &s;ent back to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and is &s;ignified to the Par|ties.
This Method &s;aves a great deal of Trouble and Sollicati|ons,
which in my Opinion ought always to be forbidden. As
to bu&s;ine&s;s here, it is exce&s;&s;ive tedious, whether it be at Court
or in the City, and ruines one in a little time. The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Practitioners are great Knaves in their Trade.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal different Councils, all compo&s;ed of Per&s;ons
of Quality, and the greate&s;t part are Councellors of the Sword.
The fir&s;t is the Council of State, the others are called the &s;u|pream
Council of War, the Royal Council of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> the Al|caides
of Court, the Council of the Holy <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> the Council
of Orders, the Sacred, Supream and Royal Council of <HI>Arragon,</HI>
the Royal Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> the Council of the Chamber of
<HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> the Council of <HI>Italy,</HI> the Council of the <HI>Finances,</HI> the
Council of the <HI>Croi&s;ado,</HI> the Council of <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Court for
the Duty of Hor&s;e, the Court for his Maje&s;ties Woods, and the
Courts of the Millions.</P>
<P>They under&s;tand &s;o little how to manage things to the be&s;t
advantage, that when a Father dyes and leaves ready Money,
and &s;ome Children under Age, that they lock the Money up in
a Che&s;t, and never put it out to be improved. For Example,
The Duke <HI>de Frias,</HI> who&s;e Widow is marryed to the Con&s;table
of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> left three Daughters, and &s;ix hundred thou&s;and
Crowns in ready Money, they put it into three Che&s;ts, with
the Name of each Daughter. The Elde&s;t was not &s;even
years old; &s;he is now marryed in <HI>Flanders</HI> to the Prince <HI>de
Ligne.</HI> The Guardians con&s;tantly kept the Keys of the&s;e Che&s;ts,
and never opened that of the Elde&s;t, but to compt it to her
Husband. Ob&s;erve what a lo&s;s there is of Intere&s;t: But they
tell you it would be much wor&s;e, if the Principal happened to
be lo&s;t; &s;ometimes when one thinks they have put it &s;e|curely
<PB N="166" REF="169">
out, it proves quite otherwi&s;e: That a Bankrupt makes
one lo&s;e all, &s;o that is is better to gain nothing, than to hazard
the Pupils E&s;tate.</P>
<P>It is time to come to an end, Dear Co&s;en, I &s;hall be afraid
to tire you with a longer Letter: I be&s;eech you cau&s;e all tho&s;e
I &s;end you, to be delivered, and pardon the freedom I take;
Adieu, I embrace and con&s;tantly love you with all my Heart.</P>

<P>YOU did me a particular Kindne&s;s in letting me know
that all my Letters come to your hands, for I was
a little concerned for the Two la&s;t: And &s;ince you
&s;till de&s;ire it (dear Co&s;en) I &s;hall continue to in|form
you of every thing that pa&s;&s;es, and of all that I ob&s;erve in
this Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Royal</HI> Palace is built upon a Hill which in&s;en&s;ibly de|&s;cends
to the very Banks of the River called <HI>Manzanarez.</HI> It
looks &s;everal ways upon the Country, which is very plea|&s;ant
there. One goes to it through the <HI>Callemayor,</HI> that is
to &s;ay, the great Street, which indeed is both very long and
broad, &s;everal con&s;iderable Hou&s;es add to its Beauty. There's
a large open place before the <HI>Palace,</HI> no body of what Qua|lity
&s;oever, is allowed to come with a Coach into the Court,
<PB N="168" REF="171">
but they &s;top under the great Arch of the Porch, except it
be when Bonefires are made there, or when there are <HI>Ma&s;que|$ades,</HI>
and then Coaches go in, a very &s;mall number of Halbar|deers
&s;tand at the Gate, upon my asking, why &s;o great a King
had &s;o &s;mall a Guard, why, Madam, &s;ays a <HI>Spaniard</HI> to me, <HI>Are
not we all his Guard?</HI> He reigns too ab&s;olutely in the Hearts of
his Subjects, either to fear any thing, or di&s;tru&s;t them. The
Palace &s;tands at the end of the City towards the South, it is
built of very white Stone. Two Pavilions compleat the Front,
the re&s;t is not regular. Behind it, there are two &s;quare Courts,
each con&s;i&s;ting of four &s;ides, the fir&s;t is adonred with two great
Tarra&s;s-walks, which run quite through, they are rai&s;ed upon
high Arches, and are beautified with Balli&s;ters and Statues;
That which I ob&s;erved very &s;ingular, was, that the Womens
Statues had <HI>Red</HI> upon their Cheecks and Shoulders, you go
through fine Porches which bring you to the Stair-ca&s;e, which
is extream large, the Apartments are furni&s;ht with excel|lent
Pictures, admirable Tapi&s;try, mo&s;t rare Statues, &s;tately
Hou&s;hold Goods, and in a word, with every thing &s;uitable to
a <HI>Royal-Palace.</HI> But there are divers of the Rooms dark, I &s;aw
&s;ome which had no Window, and received Light only when
the Door opened, tho&s;e which have Windows are but little
lighter, becau&s;e of their &s;malne&s;s, they alledge that the Heat
is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that they are willing to hinder the Sun from co|ming
in, as much as they can. But there's yet another Rea&s;on,
for Gla&s;s is very &s;carce and dear; and as to other Hou&s;es, there
are many which have Windows without any Gla&s;s; and when
they would de&s;cribe a compleat Hou&s;e, they'll tell you in one
word, that <HI>'tis Glazed.</HI> This want of Gla&s;s does not appear
without, becau&s;e of the Latices. The Palace is adorned with
divers gilt Balconies, which indeed looked very fine. All the
<HI>Councils</HI> &s;it there, and when the <HI>King</HI> has a mind to be pre&s;ent,
he pa&s;&s;es through certain Galleries and little Entries unpercei|ved.
There's $ great many People per&s;waded, that the Ca&s;tle
of <HI>Madrid,</HI> which <HI>Francis</HI> the Fifth cau&s;ed to be built near the
Wood of <HI>Bologn,</HI> was after the Model of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Pa|lace,
but 'tis a mi&s;take, and nothing is le&s;s alike. The Gardens
are not &s;uitable to the Dignity of the Place, they are neither
large enough, nor &s;o well improved as they &s;hould be, the Ground
as I have ob&s;erved, reaches to the very Brink of <HI>Manzanarez,</HI>
the whole is inclo&s;ed with Walls, and if the&s;e Gardens have any
Beauty, they owe it purely to Nature. They work hard to get
the Young <HI>Queens</HI> Apartment ready for her Reception, all her
<PB N="169" REF="172">
Servants are named, and the King expects her with the great|e&s;t
Impatience.</P>
<P>The <HI>Buen Retiro</HI> is a Royal Hou&s;e near one of the Gates of
the City, the Count Duke cau&s;ed at fir&s;t, a little Hou&s;e to be
built there, and called it <HI>Galinera,</HI> it was for keeping his rare
Poultry in, which had been pre&s;ented to him, and as he often
went to &s;ee them, and the Scituation of the Place was on the
de&s;cent of a little Hill, and there was a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect, &s;o he
was invited to undertake a con&s;iderable Building. Four great
Apartments and four great Pavillions make a perfect Square. In
the middle there's a Flower-Pot, well furni&s;hed with Flowers
and a Fountain, who&s;e Statue (which throws the Water when
they have a mind) Sprinkles the Flowers and the Cro&s;s-Walks,
which goes from one Apartment to another. This Building
has the fault of being too low, the Rooms are large, &s;tately, and
adorned with curious Paintings. Every thing &s;hines with Gold
and lively Colours, with which the Ceilings and Floors are
beautified. I took notice in the great Gallery, of the Entry
of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Mother to the late Queen, &s;he's on Hor&s;e|back,
with a Ruff and Fardingal, &s;he has a Hat trimmed with
Jewels, a Plume of Feathers, &s;he is fat, fair and plea&s;ing, &s;he
has fine Eyes, and her Looks are &s;weet and ingenuous. The
Room for acting Plays in, is well de&s;igned, very large, all well
&s;et out, with Carving and Guilding, there may be fifteen in a
Box without inconvenience to each other, they have all Latice
Windows, and the King's is richly guilt, there's neither Galle|ries
nor Amphitheatre, every body &s;its upon Benches on the
Floor. On the &s;ide of the Terra&s;s is the Statue of <HI>Philip</HI> the II.
upon a Hor&s;e of Bra&s;s, this Piece is of great Value, tho&s;e that
are curious plea&s;e them&s;elves in taking a draught of him. The
Park is above a good League in compa&s;s, there are in it divers
&s;eperate Lodges, very pretty, and which have good Accommo|dation
of room, there's a Canal which is &s;upplyed with Water
from Springs at a va&s;t Charge, and another &s;quare Place in which
the King has little Gundoloes painted and gilt, thither he goes
during the great Heats of the Summer, the Fountains, Trees
and Meadows making that Place more cool and plea&s;ant than a|ny
other, there's Grottos, Cataracts, Ponds, Shades, and in &s;ome
parts even &s;omething of the wild Fields, which &s;hews the &s;im|plicity
of the Country, and is extream delighful.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ca&s;a del Campo</HI> is for rural Affairs, it is not great, but
its Scituation is fine, being upon the Bank of <HI>Man&s;anarez,</HI> the
Trees in't are high, and yield a Shade at all times. I &s;peak
<PB N="170" REF="173">
of the Trees of this Country, becau&s;e one fines very few of
them, there's Water in divers parts of it, particularly one
Pond which is &s;urrounded with great Oaks. The Statue of
<HI>Philip</HI> the IV. is in the Garden, this Place is a little neg|lected.
Here I &s;aw Lions, Bears, Tigers and other wild
Bea&s;ts, which live very long in <HI>Spain,</HI> becau&s;e the Climate is
little different from that from which they come, many People
go there to think, and the Ladies u&s;ually choo&s;e this Place
to walk in, becau&s;e 'tis le&s;s frequented than others. But to
return to <HI>Man&s;anarez,</HI> this River does not run up to the City,
at certain times it is neither River, nor &s;o much as a Brook,
tho' at other times, it is &s;o big and rapid, that it carries before
it all that &s;tands in its way, all the Summer People walk in
it, there's &s;o little water in't at this &s;ea&s;on, that one can hardly
wet ones foot, and yet in Winter, all on a &s;udden, it over|flows
the adjacent Country, this is cau&s;ed by the melting of the
great Quantities of Snow which covers the Hills, and &s;o de|&s;cends
into the <HI>Man&s;anarez</HI> in violent Torrents of Water.
<HI>Philip</HI> the II. cau&s;ed a Bridge to be built over it, which they
called the <HI>Segovia Bridge,</HI> it is a very lofty one, and every way
as fine as the <HI>Pont-neuf,</HI> over the River <HI>Seine</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> when
Strangers &s;ee it, they fall a laughing, they think it ridiculous
to have cau&s;ed &s;uch a Bridge to be built, where there's no Wa|ter.
Hereupon there was one &s;aid wittily enough, <HI>he would
advi&s;e them to &s;ell the Bridge, and buy &s;ome Water.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Florid</HI> is a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Hou&s;e, and its Gardens are
infinitely delightful; there are in great numbers <HI>Italian</HI> Sta|tues
by the be&s;t Ma&s;ters: The Water there makes a pretty &s;o$t
of a murmur, which with the &s;weet &s;well of the Flowers (of
which they have a Collection of the rare&s;t and be&s;t &s;cent) is
very charming. From thence we come to the <HI>Prado Nuevo,</HI>
where there are &s;everal &s;pouting Fountains, and Trees there
are of an extraordinary height; this is a Walk, which though
it be not even Ground, yet is not le&s;s agreeable; its de&s;cent
is &s;o ea&s;ie, that one hardly perceive the unevenne&s;s of the
Place.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o the <HI>Carzuela,</HI> which affords nothing but Con|trary
delights, and &s;ome cool Rooms, where the King comes
and re&s;ts him&s;elf after Hunting; but 'tis the Pro&s;pect which
yields the Plea&s;ure, and very fine things might be there
made.</P>
<P>That I may tell you of &s;omething el&s;e be&s;ides the Kings
Hou&s;es, you mu&s;t know, dear Co&s;en, that on <HI>May-day,</HI> they
$e&s;ort to a Place without the Gate of <HI>Toleda.</HI> This is called
<PB N="171" REF="174">
<HI>El Sotillo,</HI> and no body excu&s;e them&s;elves from going thither,
to be &s;ure then I went, but it was more to &s;ee then be &s;een,
tho' my <HI>French</HI> Dre&s;s made me very remarkable, and drew a
great many Eyes upon me. The Women of great Quality ne|ver
go abroad to take the Air in their whole Life, except it be
in the fir&s;t year of their Marriage, I mean into publick Walks
and Places; and then too, 'tis under the very no&s;es of their
Husbands, the Wife at the lower, and the Husband at the up|per
end of the Coach; the Curtains all open, and &s;he finely a|dorned:
but 'tis a ridiculous thing to &s;ee the&s;e two Creatures
&s;it like Statues, looking at each other, and without &s;peaking
a word in an hours time. There are certain days &s;et apart for
walking and taking the Air, all <HI>Madrid</HI> go abroad then; the
King is &s;eldom there, but except the King and a few Courtiers
no body el&s;e fail of going. That which makes it very trouble|&s;ome
is, their long Traces, which take up a great compa&s;s of
Ground, and occa&s;ions the Hor&s;es often to entangle. Several
Ladies which are not of the highe&s;t Rank, re&s;ort thither, but
with their Curtains clo&s;e drawn; they only look through little
Gla&s;&s;es which are fa&s;tned into the &s;ides of the Coach, but at
Night the Ladies of great Quality come <HI>Incognito;</HI> and when
'tis dark they plea&s;e them&s;elves &s;o far as to walk a foot: They
wear white Mantles upon their Heads, the&s;e are a kind of a
Hood made of Woolen Stuff, which covers them all over:
they Embroider them with black Silk: they are only the or|dinary
Women, and &s;uch as go upon &s;ome Intreague, which
wear them; yet &s;ometimes, as I have &s;aid, certain <HI>Court-La|dies</HI>
will go in this Dre&s;s. The <HI>Cavallero's</HI> al&s;o alight and
walk, and &s;ay &s;ome odd thing or other to them, but they meet
with their Match.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>de Berka,</HI> the <HI>German</HI> Envoy, told me, that
t'other night as he was at Supper, and his Windows (becau&s;e
of the cold) being &s;hut, &s;ome body knocked at the Lattice of
his Hall, he &s;ent to &s;ee who it was; they found three Wo|men
in white Mantles, who de&s;ired to have the Windows o|pened
that they might &s;ee him. He &s;ent them word, that they
would be more conveniently in the Hall. They came in all
concealed, and placed them&s;elves in a corner, and &s;o &s;tood all
the while he was at Table. He intreated them (but in
vain) to &s;it down and eat &s;ome Sweetmeats, but they would
neither do one nor t'other; but after they had &s;aid a great ma|ny
merry things to him, in which they abundantly &s;hewed a
&s;trange quickne&s;s of Wit, they went away. He di&s;covered
that the&s;e were the Dutche&s;&s;es <HI>de Medina Celi, de O&s;&s;ona</HI> and
<PB N="172" REF="175">
<HI>Ducado,</HI> having &s;een them at their own Hou&s;es; for <HI>Amba&s;|&s;adors</HI>
have the priviledge &s;ometimes to go to the great Ladies,
and to give them a vi&s;it of <HI>Audience;</HI> but he was willing to have
yet a greater certainty, and therefore cau&s;ed them to be fol|lowed,
and they were &s;een to go into one of their Hou&s;es by a
fal&s;e Door, at which &s;ome of their Women waited for them.
The&s;e little Di&s;gui&s;es are not always attended with over much
Innocence.</P>
<P>As to the Men, when Night comes, they walk a foot in the
<HI>Prado,</HI> they make up to the Coaches in which they &s;ee Wo|men,
and leaning upon the Bouts, they either throw Flowers,
or &s;prinkle &s;weet Water upon them, and when they are per|mitted,
they go into the Coach to them.</P>
<P>But as to the meeting on <HI>May-day.</HI> It is certainly a great
plea&s;ure to &s;ee the Citizens and the People how they &s;it&punc; &s;ome
upon the young Corn, &s;ome upon the &s;ides of the <HI>Man&s;ana|rez,</HI>
others playing at <HI>Ombre,</HI> and others either with their
Wives, Children, Friends or Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, basking them&s;elves
in the Sun; &s;ome are eating of a Sallad with Leeks and Oni|ons,
and others, hard Eggs; and others Gammon of Bacon,
and even <HI>Galinas de Loche,</HI> which are Sea-Hens, and every ex|cellent.
They all drink Water like Ducks, and play either up|on
the Guittar or Harp. The <HI>King</HI> came there with <HI>Don John,</HI>
the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi,</HI> the Con&s;table <HI>de Ca&s;tile,</HI> and the
Duke <HI>de Pa&s;tratie.</HI> I only &s;aw his Coach of green Oyl-cloth
drawn by &s;ix pyed Hor&s;es, the fine&s;t in the World; and all co|vered
over with Gold-&s;pangles, and knots of Ro&s;e-coloured
Ribon: The Curtains of the Coach were of green Damask,
with a fine gold Fringe, but &s;o clo&s;e drawn, that one could per|ceive
nothing but through the little Gla&s;&s;es on the &s;ides of the
Coach. It is the Cu&s;tom, when the King pa&s;&s;es by, to &s;tand
&s;till, and in re&s;pect, to draw the Curtains; but we, according
to the <HI>French</HI> Fa&s;hion, let ours be open, and were &s;atisfied in
making a very low Bow. The <HI>King</HI> took notice of a Spanil|bitch
I had in my Arms, and which the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Alvi,</HI>
who is a very pretty Lady, de&s;ired me to carry to the Con|&s;table
of <HI>Colonna's</HI> Lady; and as I loved it mightily, &s;he &s;ent
it to me very often. The <HI>King</HI> &s;ent the Count <HI>de los Arcos,</HI>
Captain of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Guards, to ask me for it; he came up
to the Coach &s;ide on Hor&s;e-back. I immediately gave it to
him, and the Creature had the Honour to be made much of by
his Maje&s;ty, was mightily plea&s;ed with the little Bells about her
Neck, and the Buckles upon her Ears. He had a Bitch which
he loved extreamly, and he &s;ent to ask me if I would be wil|ling
<PB N="173" REF="176">
that he &s;hould keep mine for <HI>Daraxa,</HI> which was the
Name of his.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily imagine, Dear Cou&s;in, what an&s;wer I made.
He returned me the Spaniel, but without either her Collar or
Buckles, and he ordered the Count <HI>de los Arcos</HI> to give me a
gold Box full of Pa&s;trils, which he had about him, and de&s;ired
me to keep it. It is but of a &s;mall value, but coming from
&s;uch a hand, I mightily e&s;teem it.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Don John,</HI> who is my Kin&s;woman's Friend, which ob|tain'd
this mark of the <HI>King</HI>'s bounty to me; for he knew of
my being in <HI>Madrid,</HI> though I had not had the Honour yet to
&s;ee him.</P>
<P>Two days afterwards, as I was all alone in my apartment,
bu&s;ie in painting a &s;mall Piece, I &s;aw come in, a Man whom I
knew not; but one, who by the air of his Face, I could ea&s;ily
judge to be of Quality: He told me, that not having met with
my Kin&s;woman, he was re&s;olved to tarry till &s;he came, for
he had Letters to give her. After &s;ome little Di&s;cour&s;e, he
gave occa&s;ion to talk of <HI>Don John,</HI> and told me that he doubt|ed
not that I frequently &s;aw him. I reply'd, that indeed,
&s;ince my arrival, this <HI>Prince</HI> came often to vi&s;it my Kin&s;wo|man,
but he never ask'd for me. The rea&s;on of that perhaps,
adds he, was, becau&s;e you were &s;ick that day. I was not &s;ick,
reply'd I, and I &s;hould have been very glad both to have &s;een
and heard him, for I have been told both good and ill of him,
and I have a mind to know whether they do him right or
wrong. I have &s;ignify'd my de&s;ire to my Kin&s;woman, but
&s;he told me, there was no way to gratifie me, for he was &s;o
devout, that he would &s;peak to no Woman. Is it po&s;&s;ible,
&s;ays he, in &s;miling, that his Devotion &s;hould &s;o much di&s;turb
his Mind? for my part, I am confident he ask'd for you, and
was a&s;&s;ur'd that you were ill of a Feaver; Of a Feaver! cry'd
I, that's very &s;trange! I be&s;eech ye, how do you know it?
But ju&s;t then, my Kin&s;woman came in, &s;he was extreamly a|mazed
to find <HI>Don John</HI> with me, and &s;o was I, for I little
thought it was he. He told her &s;everal times, that he knew
not how to pardon her for the Idea &s;he had given me of him,
that he was no Bigot, and that he was per&s;waded, true Devo|tion
did not make a Man rude and inhumane.</P>
<P>I think him very hand&s;ome, of a noble Carriage, very well
bred, and extream witty, and of a mighty quickne&s;s of Mind.
As my Kin&s;woman has a great &s;hare of Wit, &s;o &s;he clear'd
her &s;elf well enough from what he taxt her with. But when
he was gone, &s;he was ready to eat me for anger, becau&s;e I
<PB N="174" REF="177">
deny'd having had a Feaver. I de&s;ired her to excu&s;e me,
becau&s;e I was ignorant what &s;he had &s;aid to him, and that
I could not <HI>divine:</HI> She an&s;wer'd me, that at Court, one mu&s;t
either be able to <HI>divine,</HI> or el&s;e they would act a very &s;illy
part.</P>
<P>She ask'd the Prince, if it was true, that the <HI>Queen</HI>-Mother
had writ to the <HI>King,</HI> and beg'd that &s;he might &s;ee him, and
that he had refus'd her. He agreed it was, and al&s;o, that that
was the only rea&s;on which hindred his Maje&s;ty from going to
<HI>Aranjus,</HI> le&s;t &s;he &s;hould come to him there, contrary to the
Prohibition for her not &s;tirring out of <HI>Toleda.</HI> What, my
<HI>Lord,</HI> &s;aid I, will not the <HI>King</HI> &s;ee the <HI>Queen</HI> his Mother? Say
rather, replies he, that 'tis <HI>State Policy</HI> which forbids <HI>Sovereigns
to follow their Inclinations when they do not &s;uit with the publick
good.</HI> We have a con&s;tant Maxim in the <HI>Council of State,</HI> al|ways
to con&s;ult the Spirit of <HI>Charles</HI> V. in all difficult Matters;
we enquire what he would have done upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion,
and that we endeavour to practice in our turn. For my
part, I am of Opinion with a great many others, that he
ought not to &s;ee his Mother, &s;ince it was fit for him to bani&s;h
her; and the <HI>King</HI> him&s;elf is &s;o fully per&s;waded of this, that
he an&s;wered her, it could not be. But it was not difficult for
me to &s;ee, that <HI>Don John</HI> fitted the Genius of <HI>Charles</HI> V. to his
own.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> is gone to <HI>Buen Retiro,</HI> where I had the Honour
to &s;ee him fir&s;t, at a Play, for he open'd the Lattice of his
Box to look at us in ours, becau&s;e we were dre&s;t after the
<HI>French</HI> way. The <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador's Lady was dre&s;t after
the &s;ame fa&s;hion, and &s;o hand&s;ome, that he told the Prince of
<HI>Monteleon,</HI> he was mightily taken with us, only it was pitty
that our Heads were not trim'd, and our Bodies clad after the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mode; that the more he look'd at the <HI>French</HI> Ladies
Cloths, the more they di&s;pleas'd him, that the Mens did not
&s;o much offend him. The <HI>Opera</HI> of <HI>Alcinus</HI> was acted before
him, but I gave little Attention to it, looking &s;o earne&s;tly at
the <HI>King,</HI> that I might be able to de&s;cribe him to you. I mu&s;t
tell you then, that his Complexion is delicate and fair, he has
a broad Fore-head, his Eyes are fine, and have a great deal of
&s;weetne&s;s in them; his Face is very long and narrow, his
Lips like tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> are very thick, and his
Mouth is wide, his No&s;e is very much hawk't, his Chin is
&s;harp and turns up, he has a great Head of Hair, and fair,
$ank and put behind his Ears, his Stature is pretty high,
&s;traight and &s;lender, his Legs are &s;mall, and almo&s;t all of a
<PB N="175" REF="178">
thickne&s;s: He is naturally very kind and good, he is inclin'd
to Clemency, and of the <HI>great variety of Council he has given
him, he takes that which is mo&s;t for the advantage of his People,
for he loves them extreamly.</HI> He is not of a Vindicative Spirit,
he is &s;ober, liberal and pious; his Inclinations are Vertuous, he
is of an even temper, and of ea&s;ie acce&s;s: He hath not had all
that Education which is requi&s;ite to form the Mind, but yet
he does not want any neither. I will now note &s;ome of his
merry Humours which have been told me, and though they
are of no great importance, yet it may &s;till be plea&s;ant to
know them.</P>
<P>It is not long &s;ince the Lady <HI>Conne&s;table de Collona,</HI> who is
in a <HI>Religious Hou&s;e</HI> at St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> got out of the <HI>Abbey</HI> from
whence &s;he had made &s;everal E&s;capes; the <HI>Nuns</HI> tyr'd with
her proceeding, re&s;olved to admit her no more; and indeed
the la&s;t time &s;he endeavoured to get in, they plainly told her,
that &s;he might either betake her &s;elf to the World, or choo&s;e
&s;ome other place than their Hou&s;e for a Retirement. She was
extreamly offended at this refu&s;al, which by no means &s;uited
with a Per&s;on of her Quality and Merit. She got &s;ome of her
Friends to apply them&s;elves to the <HI>King,</HI> and he &s;ent Orders to
the <HI>Abbe&s;s</HI> to receive her in again. The <HI>Abbe&s;s</HI> and all the
<HI>Nuns</HI> were ob&s;tinate in their refu&s;al, &s;aying, that they would
them&s;elves repre&s;ent their Rea&s;ons to his Maje&s;ty, and in their
Per&s;ons go to him. When this An&s;wer of the <HI>Nuns,</HI> was re|lated
to the <HI>King,</HI> he bur&s;t out a laughing, and &s;aid, It will be
pretty &s;port to &s;ee this <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Nuns,</HI> who will come
along &s;inging, <HI>Libera nos Domine de la Conte&s;tabile.</HI> But yet
they did not go, and cho&s;e rather to obey, which is always
&s;afe&s;t.</P>
<P>Some days ago it rain'd and thunder'd mo&s;t terribly; the
<HI>King,</HI> who &s;ometimes plea&s;es him&s;elf in playing little Tricks
with his <HI>Courtiers,</HI> commanded the Marquis <HI>d' A&s;torgas</HI> to wait
for him upon the Terras Walk in the Palace. The good old
Man &s;aid to him in &s;miling, <HI>Sir, will it be long before you come?</HI>
Why do you ask, &s;aid the <HI>King?</HI> that your Maje&s;ty, reply'd
he, may &s;end a Coffin to put me in, for there's no likelyhood
that I &s;hould be able to contend with &s;uch Weather as this&punc;
Go, go <HI>Marque&s;s,</HI> &s;ays the <HI>King,</HI> I'll come to you. The <HI>Mar|que&s;s</HI>
went out, and without any Scruple, &s;tept into his Coach
and went directly home. Two hours afterwards, the <HI>King</HI>
&s;aid, <HI>for certain the good old Man is wet to the Skin, let him
be call'd in, I have a mind to &s;ee him in &s;uch a Condition.</HI> But
they told the <HI>King</HI> that he did not expo&s;e him&s;elf at all,
<PB N="176" REF="179">
upon which he &s;aid, that he was not only old, but very
wi&s;e.</P>
<P>There was taken a little while &s;ince uear the Palace di&s;guis'd
in Man's Clothes, one of the hand&s;ome&s;t <HI>Mi&s;&s;es</HI> of <HI>Madrid,</HI> &s;he
had &s;et upon her Gallant, of whom &s;he believed &s;he had cau&s;e
to complain, he knowing her by her Voice and the manner of
handling her Sword, would not make u&s;e of his to defend him|&s;elf,
&s;o far from it, that he opened his Wa&s;t-coat, and gave
her free leave to thru&s;t at him, thinking perhaps, that &s;he ei|ther
was not angry, or had not Courage enough to do it; but
he deceiv'd him&s;elf, for with all her &s;trength &s;he made a Pa&s;s
at him, which made him drop drown, &s;he no &s;ooner perceiv'd
his Blood, but &s;he threw her &s;elf upon the ground, and cri'd
out mo&s;t dreadfully, tore her Skin off her Face, and pull'd
her Hair off her Head: the People which were got about her
very well perceiv'd by her Looks, and her long Hair, that &s;he
was a Woman, the Officers of Ju&s;tice &s;eiz'd her, and &s;ome
<HI>Lords</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by at that time, &s;eeing her, related to the <HI>King</HI>
what had happen'd: He had a mind to &s;peak with her, &s;he was
brought before him; Art thou &s;he, &s;aid he, to her, that has
wounded a Man near the Palace, Yes, <HI>Sir,</HI> an&s;wered &s;he, I
was re&s;olv'd to be revenged of an ungrateful Man; he promis'd
I &s;hould have his Heart, yet I am a&s;&s;ured he gave it &s;ince
to another. But why art thou &s;o afflicted, repli'd he, &s;ince thou
ha&s;t got thy Revenge? Ah, <HI>Sir,</HI> continued &s;he, in &s;eeking my
Revenge, I have puni&s;ht my &s;elf, I am now upon the brink of
De&s;pair, I be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty to command them to put me
to death, for I have de&s;erv'd the &s;evere&s;t Torment. The <HI>King</HI>
took pity of her, and turning to tho&s;e about him, Well, really,
&s;aid he, I can hardly believe that there's in the World &s;o mi|&s;erable
a State, as to love and not to be beloved. Go, &s;aid he,
thou ha&s;t more Love than Rea&s;on, But endeavour to be wi&s;er
for the future, and do not abu&s;e that Liberty I re&s;tore to thee.
And thus &s;he withdrew without being carri'd to the Place where
they keep mi&s;erable Wretches that have led ill Lives.</P>
<P>All this that I have told you of the <HI>King</HI> has carri'd me from
the <HI>Opera</HI> of <HI>Alcinous,</HI> the fir&s;t time I &s;aw it was, with &s;o much
wandring of Mind, that when I &s;aw it again, it appear'd
quite new to me, there was never &s;een more &s;orry Machines,
they m$de the <HI>Gods</HI> come down on Hor&s;eback upon a Beam
which reacht from one end of the Theater to the other; the
Sun &s;hin'd by the help o$ a dozen of oyl'd Paper Lanthorns, in
each of which there was a Lamp: when <HI>Alcinous</HI> practis'd her
$$chantments, and invok'd the <HI>Demons,</HI> they came conveni|ently
<PB N="177" REF="180">
out of <HI>Hell</HI> by Ladders: <HI>Le Gratio&s;a;</HI> that is to &s;ay, the
<HI>Jack-Pudding</HI> &s;aid a thou&s;and Impertinences, the Singer$ had
indifferent good voices, only they &s;ang too much in the Throat.
Heretofore there was a Liberty for &s;everal &s;orts of People to
come into the great Room, but this Cu&s;tom is chang'd, and
now there's only &s;uffer'd to come in, the Great <HI>Lords,</HI> and at
the mo&s;t, <HI>Tituladoes</HI> and the <HI>Knights</HI> of the Three <HI>Military</HI>
Orders. This Room is certainly a very fair one, it is all paint|ed
and gilt; the Boxes, as I have already told you, are al|ways
barr'd with Lattices like tho&s;e we have at the <HI>Opera;</HI> but
they reach from top to bottom, and look as if they were
Chambers, that &s;ide where the <HI>King</HI> &s;its is magnificent. As
for the re&s;t, the fine&s;t Comedy in the World (I mean tho&s;e
that are acted in the City) very often receives it Fate from the
weak Fancy of &s;ome ignorant Wretch or other. But there is
one particularly, and a Shoomaker, which decides the matter,
and who hath gain'd &s;uch an ab&s;olute Authority &s;o to do, thar
when the <HI>Poets</HI> have made their Plays, they go to him, and as
'twere, &s;ue for his Approbation, they read to him their Plays,
the Shoomaker with grave Looks thereupon, utters abundance
of Non&s;ence, which neverthele&s;s the poor <HI>Poet</HI> is forced to put
up, after all, if he happens to be at the fir&s;t Acting of it, every
body has their Eyes upon the Behaviour and Actions of this
pitiful Fellow, the Young People of what Quality &s;oever imi|tate
him. If he Yawns, they yawn, if he laughs &s;o do they.
In a word, &s;ometimes he grows angry or weary, and then
takes a little whi&s;tle and falls a whi&s;tling, at the &s;ame time you
&s;hall hear a hundred whi&s;tles, which make &s;o &s;hrill a noi&s;e that
'tis enough to confound the heads of the Spectators. By this
time our poor <HI>Poet</HI> is quite ruin'd, All his Study and Pains
having been at the Mercy of a Blockhead, according as he was
in a good or bad humour.</P>
<P>In this Play-hou&s;e, there is a certain part of it, which is
call'd <HI>La Ca&s;uela,</HI> it is like the Amphitheater, all the Women
that are not over-vertuous &s;it there, and thither the great
Lords go to talk with them, &s;ometimes they make &s;uch a noi&s;e
that they would outdo the Thunder, and they &s;ay things &s;o ve|ry
plea&s;ant, that they would make one die with laughing: for
their Wit is free from all re&s;traint of Decency. Be&s;ides, they
are inform'd of all things that happen in the Town; and if
they had a merry Je&s;t to break upon their <HI>Maje&s;ties,</HI> they had
rather be half hanged than lo&s;e it.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that the Women <HI>Players</HI> are a$o$d in this
Court, there's hardly any that is not the Mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;ome great
<PB N="178" REF="181">
Per&s;on, and for whom &s;everal Duels have been fought, and a
great many People kill'd. I do not know how charming their
Di&s;cour&s;e may be, but I am &s;ure their Per&s;ons are the uglie&s;t
in the World, they are extravagantly expen&s;ive&punc; and &s;ooner
mu&s;t a whole Family peri&s;h with Hunger and Thir&s;t, than one
of tho&s;e beggarly <HI>Players</HI> &s;hould want the lea&s;t Superfluity.</P>
<P>We are now in a Sea&s;on that's trouble&s;ome enough, for
'tis the Cu&s;tom here to put their Mules to Gra&s;s, and every
body almo&s;t walks a foot. At this time you can &s;ee nothing
but Gra&s;s brought from all Parts, and the greate&s;t <HI>Lord</HI> hardly
keeps two Mules to draw him, for this rea&s;on they often go on
Hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Hor&s;es which have been at the <HI>Bull-baitings,</HI> and are
good for the&s;e &s;ort of Sports, are dear, and much in reque&s;t.
The King had a mind to divert him&s;elf, and ordered a <HI>Bull-Fea&s;t</HI>
to be on the Twenty &s;econd of this Month. I was very
glad of it, for though I had heard much talk of them, I never
&s;aw any yet; and the young Count <HI>De Coni&s;mark,</HI> who is a
<HI>Swede,</HI> would <HI>Tauri&s;e,</HI> or Bait the Bull for a young Lady of my
Acquaintance. So that I was the more eager to go to the <HI>Pla|ca-Major,</HI>
where my Kin&s;woman, as &s;he was a <HI>Titulada</HI> of
<HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> had her Balcony &s;et up with a <HI>Canopy,</HI> a Carpet and
Cu&s;hion of State. To give you a particular Account of all that
pa&s;&s;es at the&s;e <HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you, that after the <HI>King</HI> has
appointed one of them, there are &s;ome Cows, which they call
<HI>Mandarines,</HI> led into the Fore&s;ts and Mountains of <HI>Andalou&s;ia.</HI>
It is known that the mo&s;t furious Bulls are in the&s;e Places, and
as they are train'd up for this purpo&s;e, &s;o they run into the
Wood; the Bulls &s;py them out, and eagerly court them, tho&s;e
fly and the&s;e pur&s;ue them&punc; and &s;o are decoy'd into certain Pal|li&s;adoes,
&s;et on purpo&s;e along the way, which is &s;ometimes
Thirty or Forty Leagues in Length, &s;everal Men are armed
with Half Pikes and well mounted, hunt the&s;e Bulls and hin|der
them from coming back, but it is not &s;eldom that they are
forc'd to fight them within the&s;e Pales, and frequently they
are kill'd or wounded.</P>
<P>There are People placed all along the Road, which bring ad|vice
when the <HI>Bulls</HI> will arrive at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and there al&s;o they
&s;et Palli&s;adoes in the Street to prevent any Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mandarines,</HI> who are real traitors, go con&s;tantly before,
and the poor Bulls quietly follow after into the very place de|&s;ign'd
for baiting them, where there are great Stables built on
purpo&s;e with Shutters, contriv'd to keep them in, there are
&s;ometimes 30, 40, or 50 together, this Stable has two Doors,
<PB N="179" REF="182">
the <HI>Mandarines</HI> go in at one, and e&s;cape at the other; and
when the Bulls think to follow them &s;till they are hindred by
a Trap, in which they are caught.</P>
<P>After they have re&s;ted a few hours, they are one after ano|ther
let out of the Stable into the great <HI>Place,</HI> where there are
a great many young, lu&s;ty, &s;trong Pea&s;ants, &s;ome of which
take the Bull by the horns, and others by the tail, and becau&s;e
they mark him upon the Buttock with a hot iron, and &s;lit his
ears, they call them <HI>Hiradores.</HI> This is not &s;o ea&s;ily done,
for there are frequently divers Per&s;ons kill'd, and this is the
beginning of the <HI>Shew,</HI> which always mightily delights the Peo|ple,
whether it be upon the Account that Blood is &s;hed, or
el&s;e, that they love to &s;ee &s;omething extraordinary, and at fir&s;t
&s;ight &s;urprizing, and which afterwards furni&s;hes with matter
for long Reflections; but though unlucky Accidents do happen
at the&s;e Fea&s;ts, yet it does not appear that they take any War|ning
from them, for they are &s;till forward to expo&s;e them|&s;elves
at every Baiting that's made.</P>
<P>The Bulls are fed, and the be&s;t of them are pickt out for the
Baiting; they can even di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e that are either Sons
or Brothers of tho&s;e Bulls which made a great &s;laughter in for|mer
<HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> they tie to their horns a long Ribbon, and by the
colour of that every body knows them again, and recites the
Hi&s;tory of their Ance&s;tors; that the Grand&s;ire or great Grand|&s;ire
of the&s;e Bulls bravely kill'd &s;uch and &s;uch a one, and they
expect no le&s;s from tho&s;e that then appear.</P>
<P>When they have &s;ufficiently re&s;ted, the <HI>Placa Major</HI> is co|vered
with Sand, and round it are placed Bars as high as a Man,
upon which are painted the Arms of the <HI>King</HI> and his King|doms.
I fancy this <HI>Place</HI> to be larger than the <HI>Place Royal</HI> at
<HI>Paris,</HI> it is longer than it is broad, and about it are Hou&s;es
built upon Pillars and Arches like Towers, five Stories high,
and to each a row of Balconies, into which there are great
Gla&s;s-doors. The <HI>King</HI>'s &s;tand more forward than the re&s;t, is
more &s;pacious, and all guilt. It is in the middle of one of the
&s;ides, with a Canopy over it; over again&s;t it are the <HI>Amba&s;|&s;adours</HI>
Balconies who have a place when the <HI>King</HI> goes to Chap|pel,
that is the <HI>Nuncio,</HI> the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Amba&s;&s;adour, that of
<HI>France,</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> the <HI>Venetian,</HI> and that of <HI>Savoy;</HI> tho&s;e of
<HI>England, Holland, Swedeland, Denmark</HI> and other <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI>
Princes, have none there. The Councils of <HI>Ca&s;tille Arragon,</HI>
the <HI>Inqui&s;ition, Italy, Flanders,</HI> the <HI>Indies,</HI> the <HI>Orders, War,</HI> the
<HI>Croi&s;ado,</HI> and of the <HI>Finances,</HI> are on the right hand of the <HI>King:</HI>
they are di&s;tingui&s;ht by their Arms upon their Crim&s;on Velvet
<PB N="180" REF="183">
Carpets which are all embroider'd with Gold. After the&s;e, are
placed the City Companies, the Judges, the <HI>Grandees</HI> and <HI>Titu|lados,</HI>
according to their &s;everal Degrees, and at the <HI>King</HI>'s
Charge, or el&s;e at the City's, who hire the&s;e Balconies of pri|vate
Per&s;ons that dwell there.</P>
<P>For all tho&s;e I have now nam'd the <HI>King</HI> makes a Collation;
and it is given in very neat Baskets, to the Women as well as
the Men, it con&s;i&s;ts of Fruits dry'd, Sweet-meats, and Water
cool'd with Ice, of Gloves, Ribbons, Fans, Pa&s;tiles, Silk-&s;tockings,
and Garters, in&s;omuch that the&s;e Fea&s;ts always co&s;t
above a hundred thou&s;and Crowns, and this Expence is defray'd
out of the Fines and Forfeitures adjudg'd to the <HI>King,</HI> or to the
City, this is a Fund which mu&s;t not be medl'd with, tho' 'twere
to &s;ave the Kingdom from the greate&s;t Danger, the doing of
it might cau&s;e a Sedition. So bewitcht are the People with
this kind of Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>From the Level of the Pavement to the fir&s;t Balcony, there
are Scaffolds made for the re&s;t of the People, they give from
Fifteen to twenty Pi&s;tols for a Balcony; and there is not any
but what are let, and adorn'd with rich Carpets, and fine Ca|nopies.
The People are not &s;eated under the <HI>King</HI>'s Balcony,
that Place is fill'd with his Guards, there's only Three Gates
open into it, through which the Per&s;ons of Quality pa&s;s in their
riche&s;t Coaches, and particularly the <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors;</HI> and they
make &s;everal turns round it, a little before the <HI>King</HI> comes.
The <HI>Cavaliers</HI> &s;alute the Ladies who &s;tand in the Balconies,
without being cover'd with their Mantles or Vails, they are
deck'd out with all their Jewels, and whatever they have that
is fine&s;t. One can &s;ee nothing but extream rich Stuffs, with
Tapi&s;try, Cu&s;hions and Carpets, all of rais'd work in Gold. I
never &s;aw any thing more glorious, the King's Balcony is hung
round with Green and Gold Curtains, which he draws when he
will not be &s;een.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> came about four a clock, and immediately all the
Coaches went out of the Place. Generally the Amba&s;&s;adour of
<HI>France</HI> is the mo&s;t taken notice of, becau&s;e he and all his Train
are dre&s;s'd after the <HI>French</HI> mode; and he is the only <HI>Amba&s;&s;a|dor</HI>
that has this Priviledge here, for the others are in the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
Dre&s;s. There's five or &s;ix Coaches go before the <HI>King</HI>'s, in
which are the Officers, the Gentlemen and Pages of his Cham|ber.
The Coach of Honour, in which there goes no body,
marches immediately before his Maje&s;ty's own, who&s;e Coachman
and Po&s;tillion are always barehead, a Footman carrying their
Hats; the Coach is &s;urrounded with Foot-Guards. Tho&s;e which
<PB N="181" REF="184">
they call the Life-Guard have Parti&s;ans, and march very near
the Coach, and next the Boots go a great many of the <HI>King</HI>'s
Pages, cloath'd in Black, and without Swords, which is the on|ly
mark to know them from other Pages. As the Ladies that
are de&s;ign'd to be about the young <HI>Queen,</HI> are already nam'd,
&s;o they all came under the Conduct of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Terra
Nova,</HI> in the <HI>King</HI>'s Coaches, they march by the Mens Bouts of
the highe&s;t Quality, &s;ome on Foot that they might be nearer,
others mounted on the fine&s;t Hor&s;es in the World, train'd up
for that purpo&s;e, and which they call <HI>Hor&s;es of Motion.</HI> That
they may perform this piece of Gallantry, they mu&s;t have leave
from their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, otherwi&s;e 'tis a great Blemi&s;h to their
Reputation, and even engages the Ladies Kindred in Trouble,
for they take their Honour to be concern'd in this Liberty:
But when &s;he approves of it, they may practi&s;e all the plea&s;ant
Humours for which the&s;e &s;ort of <HI>Fea&s;ts</HI> mini&s;ter occa&s;ion. But
though they need fear nothing from the Ladies they &s;erve, nor
their Relations, yet they are not freed from all unea&s;ine&s;s, for
the <HI>Duegno</HI>'s or Women of Honour, of which there's too great
a Provi&s;ion in each Coach, and the <HI>Guardadamas</HI> which go on
Hor&s;eback, are trouble&s;ome Ob&s;ervers&punc; hardly can one begin to
di&s;cour&s;e, but the&s;e old Haggs will draw the Curtain, and the
<HI>Guardadamas</HI> will tell you, that that Love which is fulle&s;t of
Re&s;pect is the mo&s;t di&s;creet, &s;o that very often one mu&s;t be
content to let the Eyes &s;peak, and to &s;igh &s;o loud, that one
may be heard at a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>All things being thus di&s;pos'd, the Captain of the Guards and
the other Officers mounted upon very fine Hor&s;es, enter the
Place, at the Head of the <HI>Spani&s;h, German,</HI> and <HI>Burgundian</HI>
Guards, they are cloathed in Yellow Velvet or Sattin, which is
the Livery of the <HI>King,</HI> trim'd with tufted crim&s;om Galoon
mixt with Gold and Silver. The Yeomen of the Guard, which
I call the Life-Guard, wear only a &s;hort Cloak of the &s;ame Live|ry,
over black Cloaths. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> wear Breeches tuckt up
after the old way. The <HI>Germans,</HI> which are called <HI>Tude&s;ques</HI>
wear them like the <HI>Switzers,</HI> they &s;tand in Ranks near the
<HI>King</HI>'s Balcony, while the two Captains and the two Lieute|nants,
who carry each of them a Staff of Command in their
Hands, and are follow'd by a great many Liveries, march all
four in a Rank at the head of the Guards, &s;everal times round
the Place, to give the nece&s;&s;ary Orders, and to &s;alute the La|dies
of their Acquaintance; their Hor&s;es curvet and bound con|tinually,
they are covered with knots of Ribbons, and embroi|dered
Hou&s;ings: they are called <HI>Pi&s;&s;adoyes</HI> for Di&s;tinction. Up|on
<PB N="182" REF="185">
this day every one of the&s;e <HI>Lords</HI> affect to wear that colour
which their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es love mo&s;t.</P>
<P>When the People are come without the Bars, and are &s;eated
upon their Scaffolds, the place is watered with forty or fifty
Tuns of Water which is brought thither in little Carts. Then
the Captains of the Guards come back, and take their Po&s;ts un|der
the <HI>King</HI>'s Balcony, where all the Guards are likewi&s;e pla|ced,
and make a &s;ort of a Fence, &s;tanding very clo&s;e together;
and although the Bulls are &s;ometimes ready to kill them, yet they
mu&s;t not go back nor &s;tir from their place; they only pre&s;ent to
them the point of their Halberds, and &s;o with a great deal of
hazard defend them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I do a&s;&s;ure you that this &s;trange number of People (for every
place is full, even the tops of the Hou&s;es as well as the re&s;t) the
Balconies &s;o richly &s;et out, and &s;o many beautiful Women in
them, this great Court, the Guards, and in a word, the whole
place makes one of the fine&s;t &s;hews that ever I &s;aw.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Guards are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the quarter where the
<HI>King</HI> is, &s;ix <HI>Alguazils,</HI> or City Door-keepers enter the place,
each holding a white Rod: Their Hor&s;es are excellent, har|na&s;s'd
after the <HI>Mori&s;co</HI> fa&s;hion, and cover'd with little Bells.
Their Habit is white, they wear Plums of Feathers, and put the
be&s;t Looks on they can, in &s;o much danger as they are in; for
they are not allow'd to &s;tir out of the <HI>Li&s;t:</HI> and 'tis their bu&s;i|ne&s;s
to fetch the <HI>Knights</HI> that are to fight.</P>
<P>I &s;hould tell you, before I proceed any further in this &s;hort
De&s;cription, that there are certain Laws e&s;tabli&s;hed for this
&s;ort of <HI>Baiting,</HI> which are call'd <HI>Duelo,</HI> that is, <HI>Duel,</HI> becau&s;e
one Knight a&s;&s;aults the <HI>Bull,</HI> and fights him in &s;ingle Combat.
The&s;e are &s;ome of the things which are ob&s;erved: One mu&s;t
be a Gentleman born, and known for &s;uch, that he may fight
on Hor&s;eback. It is not allowed to draw the Sword upon the
Bull, unle&s;s he has in&s;ulted over you; they call it in&s;ulting
when the Bull breaks or forces the Garrochion or Lance out of
the Hand, or if he make your Hat fall off, or your Cloak, or
has wounded you or your Hor&s;e, or any of your Company. In
this ca&s;e the <HI>Knight</HI> is oblig'd to pu&s;h his Hor&s;e directly upon
the Bull; for this is au <HI>Empenno,</HI> that is to &s;ay, an affront that
engages one to be reveng'd, or to dye; and he mu&s;t give him
<HI>Vna Cachilada,</HI> or a back &s;troke upon his head or neck. But
if the Hor&s;e on which the <HI>Cavellero</HI> rides, refu&s;es to go up to
the Bull, then immediately he alights, and couragiou&s;ly marches
up a foot to this fierce Animal. The Sword is very &s;hort, and
about three fingers broad. The other <HI>Knights</HI> which are there
<PB N="183" REF="186">
to fight, are al&s;o oblig'd to alight off their Hor&s;es and accom|pany
him, that is under the <HI>Empenno;</HI> but they do not &s;econd
him, &s;o as to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the lea&s;t again&s;t his Enemy. If they
all march up in this manner towards the Bull, and he flies to the
other end of the Place in&s;tead of tarrying for them, or meeting
them, after they have pur&s;ued him &s;ome time, they have &s;a|tisfied
the Laws of <HI>Duelling.</HI></P>
<P>If there be in the Town any Hor&s;es that have been at a <HI>Bait|ing,</HI>
and are dextrous at it, though they do not know the Ow|ners,
yet they'll borrow them; nay, though they do not de&s;ire
to &s;ell them, nor the others in a condition to buy them, yet
they never refu&s;e them. If by mi&s;chance the Hor&s;e is killed,
and they offer to pay for him, it is not accepted; becau&s;e, to
receive Money upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion would not be agreeable to
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Genero&s;ity. Neverthele&s;s, it would vex a Man to
have a Hor&s;e that he had taken pains to breed up, without any
more ado taken from him by the fir&s;t Stranger, and through
his means be kill'd. This &s;ort of Combat is reckoned &s;o dange|rous,
that the <HI>Indulgencies</HI> are expos'd in &s;everal Churches for
tho&s;e days, becau&s;e of the great <HI>Ma&s;&s;acre</HI> that is then made.
Several <HI>Popes</HI> would have quite aboli&s;h'd &s;uch barbarous &s;ights,
but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> begged the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;o earne&s;tly to let
them continue, that their Humour has been comply'd with and
to this day they are tolerated.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day I was there, the <HI>Alguazils</HI> came to the Gate,
which is at the end of the <HI>Li&s;t,</HI> to fetch the &s;ix <HI>Knights</HI> (of
whom the Count <HI>de Coni&s;mark</HI> was one)&punc; which offered them|&s;elves
to Combat. Their Hor&s;es are hand&s;ome to admiration,
and mo&s;t richly harna&s;s'd: Be&s;ides tho&s;e they ride on, they had
each of them a dozen led by Grooms, with as many Mules
loaded with <HI>Rejones</HI> or <HI>Garochons,</HI> which are, as I have &s;aid, Laun|ces
made of very dry Fir, about four or five foot long, painted
and gilt, and the Iron-work very well poli&s;h'd; and the Mules
were covered with Velvet Cloths of the &s;ame colour of the
Combatants, with their Arms embroider'd in Gold: This is
not practis'd at all <HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> when the City orders one, there's
far le&s;s Magnificence; but as the <HI>King</HI> commanded this, and
it was upon his Marriage, nothing was omitted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cavalleros</HI> were dre&s;t in black, embroider'd either with
Gold and Silver, Silk or Bugles, they had white Pl$mes of feathers
&s;potted with &s;everal colours, and a rich knot of Diamonds,
with a Hatband of the &s;ame. They had Scarfs, &s;ome white,
and other crim&s;on, blew and yellow, embroidered with Gold.
Some wore them round their Wa&s;t, others over their Shoul|ders

like a Belt, and others about their Arm; the&s;e la&s;t were
narrow and &s;hort, without doubt their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es pre&s;ented
them, for commonly they run to plea&s;e them, and to &s;hew that
there's no danger to which they would not expo&s;e them&s;elves
for their diver&s;ion. They had al&s;o a black Cloak which wrapt
them about. But the ends being thrown behind them, it did
not hinder her Arms: they wore little white Buskins, with
long guilt Spurs, which have only one &s;harp point after the
<HI>Moors</HI> fa&s;hion; they al&s;o &s;it a Hor&s;e like them, which is called
<HI>Cavalgas a la gineta.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cavalleros</HI> were hand&s;omly mounted, and lookt grace|fully
enough for this Country; they were nobly born, and eve|ry
one had forty Foot-men, &s;ome cloath'd in gold Mohair trim'd
with Lace; others in Carnation-colour'd Brocado, &s;tript with
Gold and Silver, and the re&s;t in &s;ome other fa&s;hion. Every one
of them was dre&s;t like a Stranger, whether 'twas <HI>Turk, Hunga|rian,
Moor, Indian,</HI> or wild People. Several of the foot-men
carried a bundle of the&s;e <HI>Garachons</HI> I have mentioned, and this
lookt very well: Thus with all their Train they cro&s;t the <HI>Plaza
Mayor,</HI> conducted by the &s;ix <HI>Alguazils,</HI> and the Trumpets
&s;ounding. They came before the <HI>King</HI>'s Balcony, and made a
profound Reverence to him, and de&s;ired leave of him to fight
the <HI>Bulls,</HI> which he granted them, and wi&s;ht them Victory.
Then the Trumpets every where began to &s;ound again, and this
is done, as 'twere, in defiance of the Bulls. All the People fall
a &s;houting, and repeat <HI>Viva, viva los bravos Cavalleros:</HI> After
this they &s;eparate, and &s;alute the Ladies of their Acquaintance.
All the Foot-men go out of the <HI>Li&s;t,</HI> except two for each
Knight, which are left to carry their <HI>Rejoues;</HI> they keep clo&s;e
to their Ma&s;ters, and 'tis very &s;eldom that they for&s;ake them.</P>
<P>Several young Men enter into the place, and they come a
great way off to fight on the&s;e days: The&s;e I now &s;peak of are
a foot, and not being nobly born, they u&s;e no Ceremonies with
them. Whil&s;t one <HI>Cavallero</HI> is fighting, the re&s;t withdraw, but
not out of the Bars; and they do not a&s;&s;ault that Bull which
another has undertaken to fight, unle&s;s he makes at them. The
fir&s;t to whom the Bull comes when they are altogether, is he
that fights him. When he has wounded the <HI>Knight,</HI> they cry
out <HI>fileno de Empenno,</HI> that is to &s;ay, it is an Obligation upon
&s;uch an one to revenge the <HI>Affront</HI> he has received from the
Bull; and indeed Honour engages him, either on Hor&s;eback,
or a foot, to attack the Bull, and give him a cut with his
Sword, as I have &s;aid, either upon his Head or Throat, without
&s;triking him in any other part. Afterwards he may fight him
<PB N="185" REF="190">
as he will, and &s;trike him where he can; but in doing this,
ones Life is a thou&s;and times in danger. When this blow is
given, if the Knights are a foot, they may mount their Hor|&s;es.</P>
<P>When the King thought it was time to begin the <HI>Baiting,</HI>
two <HI>Alguazils</HI> come under his Balcony, and he gives to <HI>Don John</HI>
the Keys of the Stable where the Bulls are &s;ecur'd; for the King
keeps the Key, and when it mu&s;t be thrown, he delivers it into
the hands of a <HI>Privado,</HI> or Chief Mini&s;ter, as a Favour. Im|mediately
the Trumpets &s;ound, the Timbrels and the Drums,
the Fifes and the Haut-boys, the Flutes and Bag-pipes make a
noi&s;e round the Place one after another, and the <HI>Alquazils,</HI>
who are naturally great Cowards, go trembling to open the
Doors where the Bulls are kept. There was a Man hid behind
the door, who &s;hut it as fa&s;t as he could, and then by a Ladder
climbed up to the top of the Stable; for 'tis u&s;ual with the Bull,
in coming out, to look behind the door, and to begin his Ex|pedition
by killing, if he can, the Man that &s;tands there: after
that he falls a running with all his might after the <HI>Alguazils,</HI> who
&s;pur their Hor&s;es to &s;ave them&s;elves, for they are not allow'd to
&s;tand upon their defence, and their be&s;t play is to run away.
Tho&s;e Men which are on foot, throw at him Arrows and very
&s;harp Darts, which are trim'd with Cutt-paper; the&s;e Darts
&s;tick in him in &s;uch a manner, that the pain cau&s;ing him to &s;tir
much makes the Iron enter deeper; be&s;ides when he runs,
the Paper makes a noi&s;e, and being on fire, vexes him extream|ly;
his Breath looks like a thick mi&s;t about him, his Eyes and
his No&s;trils are like fire, he runs &s;wifter than a Race-hor&s;e, and
holds it much better; to &s;peak truth, he &s;trikes Terror. The
Knight who is to fight him comes near him, takes a <HI>Rejon,</HI>
holds it like a Ponyard, the Bull makes up to him, he declines
his blow, and thru&s;ts his <HI>Gorachon</HI> at him; the Bull &s;o thru&s;ts it
back, that the Wood being weak, it breaks, immediately his
Foot-men, who holds ten or twelve dozen, pre&s;ent him with
another, which the <HI>Cavallero</HI> thru&s;ts al&s;o into his body; with
this the Bull falls a bellowing, grows angry, runs, leaps, and
wo be to them that &s;tand in his way: And if at any time he
is ready to run at a Man, a Cloak or Hat is thrown at him,
and this &s;tops him; or el&s;e, one falls down on the Ground, and
the Bull in running, pa&s;&s;es over him. They have al&s;o great
Figures made of Pa&s;t-bords, with which they deceive him, and
&s;o gain time to e&s;cape. That which helps them further is that
the Bull con&s;tantly &s;huts his Eyes ju&s;t before he pu&s;hes with his
Horns, and they are &s;o quick in that moment to avoid the

blow; but yet this is not &s;o certain, but that a great many
peri&s;h.</P>
<P>I &s;aw a <HI>Black,</HI> with a &s;hort Poniard, go directly to the Bull,
when he was in the height of his Fury, and between his Horns
thru&s;t it into the very &s;eam of his Skull, which is a place very
&s;oft and ea&s;ie to be pierced, but withal, very &s;mall to hit. This
was one of the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t dextrous blows that can be
imagin'd. The Bull fell down dead upon the &s;pot; and pre|&s;ently
the Trumpets &s;ounded, and &s;everal <HI>Spaniards</HI> ran with
their Swords in their Hands, to cut in pieces the Bea&s;t that
was no longer able to hurt them. When a Bull is kill'd, four
<HI>Alguazils</HI> go out to fetch four Mules, which &s;ome Grooms,
cloath'd in yellow, and Carnation-colour'd Satin, lead in. They
are covered with Feathers and little &s;ilver Bells; they have &s;il|ken
Traces, with which they tye the Bull, and &s;o draw him
away; upon which the Trumpets and People make a prodigi|ous
noi&s;e: There were twenty baited the fir&s;t day. There came
out a furious one which very dangerou&s;ly wounded <HI>Count Co|ni&s;mark</HI>
in his Leg, and yet the force of the blow did not
light upon him, but upon his Hor&s;e, whom it bur&s;t, he quickly
got off him, and though he is no <HI>Spaniard,</HI> yet he would not
be excus'd from any of the Laws: It would have drawn pity
from any body to &s;ee one of the fine&s;t Hor&s;es in the World in
&s;uch a condition; he ran violently about the place, &s;triking
fire with his feet, and kill'd a Man with a blow upon his Head
and Brea&s;t: The great Rayle was open'd for him, and he went
out. As for the <HI>Count,</HI> as &s;oon as he was wounded, a very fine
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Lady, who believ'd that he fought for her &s;ake, &s;tood
forward in her Balcony, and with her Handkerchief made &s;eve|ral
&s;igns, in all likelihood to encourage him, but he did not
&s;eem to need being animated; and although he had lo&s;t abun|dance
of Blood, and was forc'd to lean upon one of his Foot-men,
who held him up, yet with great fiercene&s;s he advanc'd
with his Sword in his hand, made a &s;hift to give a very great
wound to the Bull on his Head; and then pre&s;ently turning
him&s;elf towards that &s;ide where this young Lady, for whom
he fought, was, he ki&s;s'd his Sword, and &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be
carry'd away by his People half dead.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t not think that the&s;e &s;ort of accidents interrupt
the <HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> 'tis &s;aid, that it will not end but by the King's Or|der;
&s;o that when any <HI>Knight</HI> is wounded, the others accom|pany
him to the Bars, and immediately they return to fight.
There was a <HI>Bi&s;canier</HI> &s;o bold, as to throw him&s;elf off his Hor&s;e
upon the back of the Bull, held him by his Horn, and in &s;pight of
<PB N="187" REF="194">
all the endeavours of the Animal to throw him off, yet the <HI>Bi&s;|caneer</HI>
&s;et upon him for above a quarter of an hour, and broke
one of his Horns. If the Bulls defend them&s;elves too long, and
that the King would have others come out, (for fre&s;h ones af|ford
more delight, becau&s;e every one has his particular manner
of fighting) they turn loo&s;e &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Dogs; the&s;e are not
&s;o big as is generally &s;een there, but 'tis a Breed &s;omething like
tho&s;e the <HI>Spaniards</HI> carry'd into the <HI>Indies</HI> when they con|quer'd&punc;
them; they are &s;mall and low, but &s;o &s;trong, that
when they once &s;eize the Throat, you may &s;ooner cut them in
pieces than make them let go their hold. They are very fre|quently
kill'd, the Bull takes them upon his Horns, and to&s;&s;es
them up in the Air like Foot-balls; &s;ometimes they ham&s;tring
the Bull with certain Irons made cro&s;s-wi&s;e, which they put at
the end of a long Pole, and this they call <HI>Jaretar al toro.</HI></P>
<P>There was another <HI>Cavallero</HI> under the <HI>Empenno,</HI> becau&s;e in
fighting his Hat fell off; he did not alight, but drew his
Sword, and pu&s;hing his Hor&s;e upon the Bull which expected
him, gave him a Wound in his Neck; but as it was a &s;light
one, &s;o it &s;erv'd only to enrage him the more: He tore up the
Earth with his Feet, he roar'd, and he leapt about like a Stag.
I cannot well de&s;cribe to you this Combat, nor the Acclamations
of every body, the claping of hands, nor the multitude of Hand|kerchiefs
which are thrown up in the air, for an Expre&s;&s;ion
of Admiration, &s;ome crying out, <HI>Victor, Victor,</HI> and others <HI>Ha
Toro, Ha Toro,</HI> the more to excite the Bulls fury. Neither can I
tell you my particular di&s;turbance, and how my Heart fail'd me
every time I &s;aw the&s;e terrible Creatures ready to kill tho&s;e
brave <HI>Cavallero's:</HI> The&s;e things are equally impo&s;&s;ible to me.</P>
<P>There was a <HI>Toledian,</HI> both young and hand&s;ome, which could
not avoid being wounded by the horns of the Bull, who to&s;s'd
him up very high, he immediately died; there were two others
mortally wounded, and four Hor&s;es either kill'd or de&s;perately
hurt, and yet every body &s;aid, it had not been a <HI>fine Baiting,</HI>
becau&s;e there was &s;o little Blood &s;hed; and to have been &s;uch,
there &s;hould have been at the lea&s;t, ten Men kill'd upon the
&s;pot. It is hard to de&s;cribe the Dexterity of the <HI>Cavalleros</HI> in
fighting, and that of the Hor&s;es in avoiding the Bull. They'll
turn &s;ometimes an hour about him, and tho' they be not a foot
di&s;tant from him, yet he is not able to touch them, but when
he does hit them, he wounds them cruelly. The King threw
Fifteen Pi&s;tols to the <HI>Black</HI> that kill'd the Bull with his <HI>Ponyard,</HI>
and he gave as much to one that had &s;ubdu'd another, and &s;aid,
he would remember the Knights that had fought.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="195">
I ob&s;erv'd a <HI>Ca&s;tillian,</HI> who knew not how to defend him&s;elf,
jump upon a Bull, as nimble as a Bird. The&s;e <HI>Fea&s;ts</HI> are fine,
great and magnificent; 'tis a noble Sight, and co&s;ts abundance;
One cannot give a ju&s;t De&s;cription of it, it mu&s;t be &s;een to be
well under&s;tood. But I a&s;&s;ure you that all this did not plea&s;e
me; Do but think if a Man that is very dear to you, &s;hould be
&s;o ra&s;h to go and expo&s;e him&s;elf again&s;t a furious Bea&s;t, and
that for your &s;ake, (for generally that's the Motive) you &s;ee
him brought back weltering in his Blood, and half dead, is it
po&s;&s;ible I &s;ay, for you or any one, to approve of &s;uch Actions and
the&s;e Cu&s;toms? Nay &s;uppo&s;e one had no particular concern,
would one de&s;ire to be pre&s;ent at &s;uch Sports, that co&s;t the
Lives of &s;o many Men? For my part, I wonder that in a King|dom,
where their King bears the name of <HI>Catholick,</HI> there &s;hould
be &s;uch barbarous Diver&s;ions permitted. I am &s;atisfi'd that 'tis
very ancient, becau&s;e they derive it from the <HI>Moors;</HI> but yet
methinks this, as well as divers other Cu&s;toms which they have
from tho&s;e <HI>Infidels</HI> ought to be entirely aboli&s;ht.</P>
<P><HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> ob&s;erving me very much di&s;turbed and unea&s;ie
during the <HI>Baiting,</HI> and taking notice, that I was &s;ometimes as
pale as death, I was &s;o much frighted to &s;ee &s;ome of tho&s;e kill'd
which fought, &s;aid to me in &s;miling, what would you have
done Madam, if you had &s;een what had happen'd &s;ome years
ago? A <HI>Cavallero</HI> of worth, pa&s;&s;ionately lov'd a young Woman,
who was only a Jeweller's Daughter, but a perfect Beauty, and
was to have a great E&s;tate. This <HI>Cavallero</HI> having under&s;tood,
that the mo&s;t furious Bulls of the Mountains were taken, and
thinking it would be a very glorious Action to vanqui&s;h them,
re&s;olved to <HI>Taurize</HI> as they call it; and for that end de&s;ired leave
of his Mi&s;tre&s;s. She was &s;o &s;urprized at the bare propo&s;al only
which he made, that &s;he &s;wooned away, and by all that Power
which he had given her over him&s;elf, &s;he charged him not to
think of it, as he valued his Life. But in &s;pite of this Charge
he believed he could not give a more ample proof of his Love,
and therefore privately, caus'd all things nece&s;&s;ary to be got rea|dy
in order thereunto. But as indu&s;trious as he was to hide his
de&s;ign from his Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he was informed of it, and u&s;ed all
means to di&s;&s;wade him from it. In fine, the day of this <HI>Fea&s;t</HI> be|ing
come, he conjur'd her to be there, and told her, that her
very pre&s;ence would be &s;ufficient to make him conquer, and to
acquire a Glory, which would render him yet more worthy of
her. Your Love, &s;ays &s;he, is more ambitious than 'tis kind, and
mine is more kind than 'tis ambitious. Go where you think
Glory calls you, you have a mind I &s;hould be there, you will
<PB N="189" REF="196">
fight before me; well, I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I will be there,
but yet perhaps my pre&s;ence will afford you more matter o$
Trouble than Emulation. However he left her, and went to
the <HI>Placa Major</HI> where there was already a mighty A&s;&s;embly,
but &s;carce had he begun to defend him&s;elf again&s;t the fierce
Bull which a&s;&s;aulted him, when a Country Youth threw a dart
at this Terrible Creature, which pierced him &s;o deep, that it put
him to a great deal of pain. He immediately left the <HI>Cavallero</HI>
that was fighting him, and roaring ran directly after him that
wounded him, this Youth thus frighted would have &s;aved him|&s;elf,
when his Cap which covered his head fell off, and then the
lovelie&s;t and the longe&s;t hair which could be &s;een appeared up|on
his &s;houlders, and this di&s;covered it to be a Maid of about
Fifteen or &s;ixteen Years of Age. Fear had put her in &s;uch a
Trembling, that &s;he could neither run, nor any way avoid the
Bull. He gave her a de&s;perate pu&s;h on the &s;ide, at the &s;ame
in&s;tant her Lover knew that it was &s;he, and was running to
a&s;&s;i&s;t her. Good God! what a grief it was for him to &s;ee his
dear Mi&s;tre&s;s in this &s;ad Condition! Pa&s;&s;ion tran&s;ported him,
he no longer valued his Life, and grew more furious than the
Bull, and performed things almo&s;t incredible. He was mor|tally
wounded in divers places. On this Day, certainly the
People thought the <HI>Baiting fine,</HI> they carried the&s;e two unfor|tunate
Lovers to her unhappy Fathers Hou&s;e, they both de&s;ired
to be in the &s;ame Chamber, and though they had but a little
time to live, yet begged the Favour they might be married, ac|cordingly
they were married, and &s;ince they could not live
together, yet at la&s;t they were buried together, in one and
the &s;ame Grave. The Story has mightily increa&s;ed the Aver|&s;ion
I had already conceived again&s;t the&s;e &s;ort of <HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> and I
told <HI>Don Ferdinand</HI> &s;o, after I had thanked him for his pains in
relating it to me.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have &s;aid nothing to you concerning the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Language, in which I am endeavouring to make &s;ome Pro|gre&s;s.
It plea&s;es me extreamly, it is expre&s;&s;ive, noble, and
grave, Love finds it commodious for its work, and can play
the fool prettily enough in it. The Courtiers &s;peak more
conci&s;ely than others, they make u&s;e of &s;uch ab&s;tracted Com|pari&s;ons
and Metaphors, that unle&s;s one is u&s;ed to hear them,
half their meaning is lo&s;t. I have learnt &s;everal Languages, or
at lea&s;t under&s;tand the fir&s;t Rudiments of them, but yet in my
mind, it is only our <HI>own</HI> which exceeds the <HI>Spani&s;h.</HI></P>

the Sea, but the&s;e are Land-<HI>Gallies;</HI> for if there be Sea hor&s;es
and Dogs, why not Land ones: They are &s;haped like a Charior,
but four times longer, and have &s;ix Wheels, three on a &s;ide,
and do not go much &s;lower than a Chariot, the upper part is
round, and is very like a Gally, they are covered with Canvas,
and may contain forty Per&s;ons; there one &s;leeps and dre&s;&s;es
victuals, indeed 'tis a Moving-hou&s;e, they put eighteen or
twenty Hor&s;es to draw it, the Machine is &s;o long that it can|not
be turned but in a field, they come u&s;ually from <HI>Galicia</HI> and
<HI>Manca,</HI> the Country of the brave <HI>Don Quixot,</HI> they &s;et out
eight, ten or twelve in a Company, to be helpful to one ano|ther
in ca&s;e of need. For when one overturns, it makes a
great havock, and the be&s;t that can happen, is a broken Arm
or Legg, there mu&s;t be above a hundred to rai&s;e it up again.
In it there is carried all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, for the Country
through which they pa&s;s is &s;o very barren, that on Mountains
which are four&s;core Leagues broad, the bigge&s;t tree one meets

<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur Mollini,</HI> the <HI>Popes Nuncio,</HI> con&s;ecrated the <HI>Patriarch</HI>
of the <HI>Indies</HI> on Trinity-Sunday, and the <HI>King</HI> was there. I
&s;aw him come in, he had a Black Suit and a gold coloured Silk
Belt on, and little Pearls were &s;et round the flowers, his hat
was &s;o broad which they never cock here, that the Brims laid
upon his &s;houlders, and lookt ill. I ob&s;erved, that during the
Ceremony he eat of &s;omething which was held to him in a Pa|per,
they told me it was either Leeks or Shallots, of which he
eats very often. I was too far off, to &s;ee him well, he did not
return to <HI>Buen retiro,</HI> becau&s;e of <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti day,</HI> at which
Ceremony he would a&s;&s;i&s;t. In coming out of the <HI>Church,</HI> I
knew a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman who&s;e Name is <HI>Juncas,</HI> he is of <HI>Bur|deaux,</HI>
where I &s;aw him. I asked him how long he had been
here, he told me but a little while, and that his fir&s;t Bu&s;ine&s;s
had been to have &s;een me, had he not been engaged at <HI>Bayon,</HI>
not to lo&s;e a minutes time, in the &s;earch of a very wicked Fel|low,
which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be hid at <HI>Madrid.</HI> That it was not
the Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of the <HI>Indies</HI> con&s;ecrated,
which drew him to the <HI>Hieronomites,</HI> (otherwi&s;e the Daugh|ters
of the <HI>Conception</HI>) but that having de&s;ired to &s;peak with
one of the <HI>Nuns,</HI> he was told, that he could not &s;ee her till the
<HI>King</HI> was gone. He added, that this was one of the hand&s;o|me&s;t
Women in the World, and hath been the cau&s;e of a great
unhappine&s;s in the Family of <HI>Mon&s;ieur De Lande.</HI> I remember
<PB N="191" REF="198">
to have &s;een her as I have gone by, and intreated him to tell
me the matter. <HI>It is,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>too long and melancholy a Mi&s;|chance
to relate pre&s;ently, but if you will &s;ee the young</HI> Nun <HI>I &s;peak
of, I am per&s;waded &s;he'll not be unplea&s;ant to you.</HI> I willingly
accepted his Offer, becau&s;e I have &s;o often been told, that they
have &s;o much more wit in <HI>Mona&s;teries,</HI> then el&s;ewhere in the
world. We went into a Parlour, which had three &s;uch ter|rible
Iron doors with &s;pikes, as made me wonder. How is
this, &s;aid I? It has been told me, that the <HI>Nuns</HI> in this Coun|try
are very amorous, but I cannot be per&s;waded, that <HI>Love</HI>
is bold enough to venture over the&s;e long Spikes, and through
the&s;e little holes, where one mu&s;t undoubtedly peri&s;h. <HI>You are
deceived,</HI> Madam, cry'd <HI>Juncas, at the Appearances of things,
if the Lady which is coming, can &s;pare me &s;o much time, I'll pre|&s;ently
tell you, what I learnt of a Friend of mine a</HI> Spaniard, <HI>the
fir&s;t Journey I made thither.</HI> But at the very in&s;tant <HI>Donna
I&s;idora</HI> came into the Parlour. I found her much hand&s;omer,
than I had fancyed her in my own Mind to be. <HI>Mon&s;ieur De
Juncas,</HI> told her, that I was a <HI>French</HI> Lady which had a great
mind to be acquainted with her, upon his report of her Merits.
She thankt me in a very mode&s;t manner, and afterwards told
us, that is was very true, that the Wretch after whom Enqui|ry
was made, had been lately at <HI>Madrid;</HI> but that &s;he was
certain he was not now there, and that he had even had the Im|pudence
to write to her by the Hands of a Man where he lodged,
that the Letter was brought to her after his Departure, and that
&s;he would not receive it. It &s;eems to me, &s;aid I, inter|rupting
of her, that he could not be taken, &s;uppo&s;ing he were
yet here. Sometimes, &s;ays <HI>Donna I&s;idora,</HI> Permi&s;&s;ion is ob|tained
from the <HI>King.</HI> There are certain Crimes for which
there is no <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> and that is one of them. She fell a
weeping, and notwith&s;tanding all her endeavours to hinder her
tears, and added, that thanks be to Heaven, &s;he could not re|proach
her &s;elf with any thing in the late Bu&s;ine&s;s, but yet &s;he
could not forbear grieving extreamly that &s;he had been the
cau&s;e of it. We talked together a good while longer, and I
was as much charmed with her Wit as with her Beauty. Af|terwards
I withdrew. I am ab&s;olutely yours, mo&s;t dear Co&s;e$,
be throughly per&s;waded of it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<P>ONE mu&s;t love you as mightily as I do dear Cou&s;en to re|&s;olve
to write to you in a Sea&s;on when the Weather is &s;o
exce&s;&s;ive hot: Whatever has been told me, and whatever I
could imagine of it, is nothing in compari&s;on to what I now
feel. To defend my &s;elf from the heat, I leave open all my
Windows all night long, without fearing the <HI>Gallick</HI> Winds
which criples a body. I &s;leep bare-head, I put my hands and
Feet in Snow, enough to kill one; but I think 'tis much at
one to dye, as to be &s;mothered with heat, as they are here.
'Tis Mid-night before one feels the lea&s;t breath of Air from the
We&s;tern <HI>Brizes.</HI></P>
<P>In going to take the Air, one is &s;ufficiently puzled; for if
the Gla&s;&s;es are open, one's choaked with the Du&s;t, of which the
Streets are &s;o full that one can hardly &s;ee, and although the
Windows of the Hou&s;es are &s;hut, the Du&s;t finds a way through
and &s;poils all Hou&s;hold Goods; &s;o that what with the ugly
&s;mell in the Winter, and the du&s;t in the Summer, all things
of Silver, and every thing el&s;e is &s;o tarni&s;hed and &s;poyled, that
little can be kept hand&s;ome any con&s;iderable time: Notwith|&s;tanding
all care at pre&s;ent, ones face will be covered with &s;weat
and du&s;t, like tho&s;e Wre&s;tlers which are repre&s;ented to us in a
Ring.</P>
<P>I &s;hould now tell you that I have &s;een the Ceremony on <HI>Cor|pus
Chri&s;ti-day,</HI> which is very &s;olemnly kept here: There's a
general <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion</HI> of all the Pari&s;hes and Mona&s;teries, which are
very numerous; the Streets thro which the <HI>Holy Sacrament</HI> is
to pa&s;s, are hung with the riche&s;t Tapi&s;try in the World; for
I do not only &s;peak of that which belongs to the Crown which
is there, but al&s;o of that which belongs to a thou&s;and particu|lar
Per&s;ons which have mo&s;t admirable Tapi&s;try. All the Bal|conies
are then without their Lattices adorned with Carpets,
rich Cu&s;hions, and Canopies: They hang Ticking cro&s;s the
Streets to hinder the Sun from being trouble&s;ome, and they
throw water upon it, to make the Air cooler: All the Streets
are &s;pread with Sand, well watered, and filled with &s;o great a
quantity of Flowers, that one can hardly tread upon any thing
el&s;e. The Repo&s;itories are extraordinary large, and adorned
with the greate&s;t &s;plendor.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="200">
No Women go in the <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion:</HI> the <HI>King</HI> was there in a
black Lute-&s;tring Taffety Suit, a Shoulder-belt of blue Silk edged
with white; his Sleeves were of white Taffety, embroidered
with Silk and Bugles, they were very long and open before, he had
little Sleeves hanging down to his Wa&s;te, his Cloak was wrapt
about his Arm, and he had on his Collar of Gold and precio$s
Stones, at which there hung a little &s;heep in Diamonds. He had
al&s;o Diamond Buckles at his Shooes and Garters, and a great
Hat-band of the &s;ame, which &s;hined like the Sun; he had like|wi&s;e
a knot which buttoned up his Hat, and at the bottom of
that a Pearl which they call the <HI>Pereagrine,</HI> it is as big as the
Ru&s;&s;et-Pear, and of the &s;ame &s;hape; it is pretended to be the
fine&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> and that both its colour and kind is in perfecti|on.
The whole <HI>Court</HI> without exception, followed the Holy
Sacrament, the <HI>Councils</HI> walked after it without any Order or
Precedency, as they happened to be, holding white Wax
Candles in their hands; the <HI>King</HI> had one, and went foremo&s;t,
next the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> where the <HI>Sacrament</HI> was. It is certainly
one of the fine&s;t Ceremonies that can be &s;een. I ob&s;erved that
all the Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber had a great Gold Key by
their &s;ide, it opens the <HI>King's</HI> Chamber, into which they can
go when they will; it is as big as a Cellar-door Key: I there
&s;aw &s;everal <HI>Knights of Malta,</HI> who wore every one of <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> of
<HI>Malta,</HI> made of <HI>Holland,</HI> and embroidered upon their Cloaks;
it was near two a Clock, and the <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion</HI> was not yet gone
in; when it pa&s;t by the <HI>Palace,</HI> they fired &s;everal Rockets, and
other Inventions.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> went to meet the <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion</HI> at St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s, which
is a Church near the Palace. Upon this day all the Ladies be|gin
to wear their Summer Garments, they make their Balco|nies
very fine, in which they have either &s;everal Baskets of
Flowers, or Bottles filled with &s;weet Water, which they throw
about whil&s;t the <HI>Proce&s;&s;ion</HI> pa&s;&s;es by. Commonly the three Com|panies
which guard the <HI>King,</HI> are new cloathed. As &s;oon as
the <HI>Holy Sacrament</HI> is gone back to the Church, every body
goes home to eat, that they may be at the <HI>Autos,</HI> which are
certain kinds of Tragedies, upon <HI>Religious Subjects,</HI> and are od|ly
enough contrived and managed: They are acted either in the
Court or Street of each Pre&s;ident of a <HI>Council,</HI> to whom it is
due. The <HI>King</HI> goes thither, and all the Per&s;ons of Quality re|ceive
Tickets over Night to go there; &s;o that we were invited,
and I was amazed to &s;ee them light up abundance of Flamboys,
whil&s;t the Sun beat full upon the Comedians Heads, and melted
the Wax like Butter; they acted the mo&s;t impertinent piece
<PB N="194" REF="201">
that ever I &s;aw I my days. This the Subject of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Knights</HI> of St. <HI>James</HI> are a&s;&s;embled, and our <HI>Lord</HI> comes
and de&s;ires them to receive him into their <HI>Order;</HI> there are
divers of them that are very willing to it, but the <HI>Seniors</HI> re|pre&s;ent
to the others, the wrong they &s;hould do them&s;elves,
if they &s;hould admit into their Society, a Per&s;on of ignoble
Birth, that St. <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> his Father, was a poor Carpenter, and that
the <HI>Holy Virgin</HI> wrought with her Needle: Our <HI>Lord</HI> with great
impatience expects their Re&s;olution, at la&s;t they determine
with &s;ome unwillingne&s;s, to refu&s;e him; but at the &s;ame time
propo&s;e an expedient, which is to in&s;titute on purpo&s;e for
him. The <HI>Order de Chri&s;to,</HI> and with this every body is &s;atisfied.
This is the <HI>Order,</HI> that is in <HI>Portugal,</HI> but yet the&s;e things are
not done with a wicked de&s;ign; no, they had rather dye than
in the lea&s;t to fail of the re&s;pect due to <HI>Religion.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Autos</HI>
la&s;t for a Month; I am &s;o we$ry of going to them, that I ex|cu&s;e
my &s;elf as oft as I can. They u&s;e Sweet-meats and Water
cooled in Ice very much, and they have need of them, for the
heat almo&s;t kills one, and the du&s;t choaks a body: I was ravi&s;h'd
with Joy to meet <HI>Don Augu&s;tin Pacheco,</HI> and his Wife (of
whom I have formerly told you) at the <HI>Pre&s;ident de Hazienda's</HI>
Hou&s;e; they came thither, becau&s;e they are related to the <HI>Pre|&s;ident.</HI>
We were placed near one another, and when the Cere|mony
was over, we went to take the Air in the <HI>Prado,</HI> after
the <HI>French</HI> Mode, that is Men and Women together in the &s;ame
Coach. <HI>Don Frederic de Cardonne</HI> was one; our Curtains were
clo&s;e drawn whil&s;t there was a great many folks, becau&s;e of our
beautiful and young <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women; but as we tarryed later
than others, the <HI>Nuncio,</HI> and <HI>Frederic Cornaro</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;ador,
cau&s;ed their Coaches to drive up to ours, and talkt
with us; when all on a &s;udden we &s;aw a great <HI>Illumination</HI> all
along the Walk, and at the &s;ame time appeared &s;ixty <HI>Cardinals</HI>
upon Mules, in their Habits and red Caps; after them followed
the <HI>Pope,</HI> he was carryed upon a certain Machine all covered with
a foot Carpet; he &s;at under a Canopy in a great Chair, and St.
<HI>Peter</HI>'s Keys laid upon a Cu&s;hion, with a Ve&s;&s;el full of holy Wa|ter
of Orange$Flowers, with which he &s;prinkled every body.
The &s;how marched on gravely; and when they were come
to the end of the <HI>Prado,</HI> the <HI>Cardinals</HI> began to play a thou|&s;and
cunning tricks to make his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> merry; &s;ome threw
their Hats upon the Trees, and &s;tanding directly under, they
fell upon their Heads again$$ and others &s;tood upright upon the
Saddles on their Mules, and made them run as fa&s;t as they could.
There was a va&s;t number of People followed them; we asked
<PB N="195" REF="202">
the <HI>Popes</HI> Nuncio what this meant, and he a&s;&s;ured us he under|&s;tood
nothing of it; and that he did not like this &s;ort of Mirth.
He &s;ent to enquire from whence the <HI>Holy Colledge</HI> came in
that manner; and we under&s;tood it was the <HI>Bakers Holy-day,</HI>
and that every year they u&s;ed to make this fine &s;hew. The
<HI>Nuncio</HI> had a great mind to have di&s;turbed them with a Volly of
Cudgels, and had already commanded his Attendants to begin
the Fray, but we interceded in the behalf of the&s;e poor People,
who had no other, intention than to celebrate the Fe&s;tival of
their <HI>Saint.</HI> In the mean time, &s;ome that had over heard the
Orders which were given, and were Di&s;turbers of the publick
Peace, gave Information thereof to the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Cardinals,</HI> this
was enough to put all in confu&s;ion, everyone e&s;caped as well as
he could, and their fear made our Plea&s;ure &s;hort lived. In <HI>France</HI>
&s;uch <HI>Ma&s;carades</HI> would not be &s;uffered, but perhaps there are
many things innocent in one Country, which would not be &s;o
in another.</P>
<P>My Kin&s;woman knowing how very civilly I had been received
by <HI>Don Augu&s;tin Pacheco,</HI> invited him to Supper at her Hou&s;e.
I de&s;ired him to remember his promi&s;e of giving me a Relation
of what he knew of the <HI>Indies,</HI> immediately I'll tell you, &s;ays
he, concerning tho&s;e they call the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> in which a part
of <HI>America</HI> is compri&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>Ferdinand King</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> and <HI>Arragon, Chri|&s;topher
Columbus</HI> a <HI>Genoway,</HI> di&s;covered this Part of the World
in the Year 1492. As the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were the fir&s;t that found
this fortunate Country, unknown to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> &s;o King
<HI>Ferdinand</HI> and Queen <HI>I&s;abel,</HI> had the Propriety of it by a Bull
from Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> VI. He e&s;tabli&s;hed them and their Suc|ce&s;&s;ors
<HI>perpetual Vicars</HI> of the <HI>Holy See,</HI> over this va&s;t Coun|try;
&s;o that the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> are both <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Temporal
Lords,</HI> and nominate <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and other <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks,</HI> and re|ceive
<HI>Tenths</HI> from them. Their power there, is of a larger ex|tent
than in <HI>Spain,</HI> for you mu&s;t know that <HI>America</HI> alone is
one of the four Parts of the World, and that we po&s;&s;e&s;s more
Land there, than all other Nations together be&s;ides. The Coun|cil
of the <HI>Indies,</HI> which is e&s;tabli&s;ht at <HI>Madrid,</HI> is one of the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Kingdom, and there being &s;o great a
nece&s;&s;ity of holding a very frequent Corre&s;pondence between
<HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> to &s;end Orders to maintain the <HI>Court</HI>
Authority, they were obliged to e&s;tabli&s;h be&s;ide, a particular
<HI>Chamber,</HI> which is compo&s;ed of the elde&s;t Coun&s;ellors of the
Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and they are to take Cognizance of all
things concerning the <HI>Revenues,</HI> and cau&s;e Expeditions by
the Secretaries of the Council.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="203">
Be&s;ides this <HI>Chamber</HI> at <HI>Madrid,</HI> there's another at <HI>Seville,</HI>
called the Hou&s;e of <HI>Contrataction,</HI> it is compo&s;ed of &s;everal
Coun&s;ellors both of the <HI>Robe</HI> and the <HI>Sword,</HI> with other ne|ce&s;&s;ary
Officers. Tho&s;e of the <HI>Sword,</HI> take Cognizance of
things which concern the <HI>Fleet</HI> and the <HI>Galleons.</HI> The other
Coun&s;ellors take Care of matters of Ju&s;tice. Appeals from
this Tribunalare made to the Council of the <HI>Indies</HI> at <HI>Madrid.</HI>
There are Regi&s;ters kept in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Contrataction</HI> at <HI>Se|ville,</HI>
in which are writ all the Merchandize that are &s;ent to
the <HI>Indies,</HI> and all that come from thence, that &s;o the <HI>King</HI>
may not be cheated of his Cu&s;toms; but this &s;ignifies little, the
Merchants are &s;o cunning, and tho&s;e who keep the Accounts
are &s;o ea&s;ily drawn to &s;hare with them, that the <HI>King</HI> is not a
whit the better for them, and the Duty to him, which is only
the fifth Part, is &s;o ill paid, that he does not receive the fourth
Part of what is due to him.</P>

<P>I do not hear mention the places of <HI>Judicature,</HI> nor the <HI>Be|nefices,</HI>
which are very numerous. But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that
all the Employmetns I have &s;poken of, are given either from
three to three Years, or from five to five Years, that &s;o one Man
alone may not grow rich, whil&s;t there are &s;o many others that
&s;tand in need to partake of the <HI>King's</HI> Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e Places where there is no <HI>Vice-Roy,</HI> he that is Pre|&s;ident,
is al&s;o Governour, and when a <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> dies, the Pre|&s;ident
of the <HI>Vice-Royalty</HI> for the time being, takes the Govern|ment
upon him, till another <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> is &s;ent from <HI>Spain.</HI> It
is his <HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ty which gives tho&s;e great Po&s;ts and the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable Governments. The <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> fill up the le&s;|&s;er,
and the&s;e <HI>Vice-Roys</HI> make a &s;hift very ea&s;ily in five Years
time, to bring home two Millions of Crowns all charges paid,
the Governours of the Principal Places, get in the &s;ame Com|pa&s;s
of time about five or &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Crowns; none
goes thither, but what grows rich, and this is &s;o certain, that
even the <HI>Fryers</HI> which are &s;ent thither to preach the <HI>Faith,</HI> and
convert the <HI>Indians,</HI> make &s;uch a Profitable <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> that they
bring home every one of them, thirty or forty thou&s;and
Crowns. The <HI>King</HI> di&s;po&s;es of divers Pen&s;ions paid by the <HI>Vil|lages</HI>
of the <HI>Indies.</HI> And from the&s;e they draw from two to
&s;ix thou&s;and Crowns <HI>per Annum.</HI> And this is another way the
<HI>King</HI> has to gratifie his Subjects.</P>
<P>The <HI>Phillipine</HI> I&s;lands which lie near the Kingdom of <HI>China,</HI>
depend upon the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Trade there is in Silk:
the&s;e places co&s;t him more to keep, than they bring him in.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ca&s;tillians</HI> had their Rea&s;ons why they would not let
any &s;ort of <HI>Manufactures</HI> be &s;et up in the <HI>Indies,</HI> nor any Stuffs
made there, nor any of tho&s;e things el&s;e, which are indi&s;pen|&s;ibly
nece&s;&s;ary. This Policy cau&s;es every thing to go from <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
and make the <HI>Indians,</HI> who pa&s;&s;ionately love all the Com|modities
and Ornaments which come from thence freely to &s;a|crifice

and divers Merchandizes which are conveyed by Land-carriage
to <HI>Porto velo,</HI> where the <HI>Galleons</HI> are, and where there is kept
one of the greate&s;t Fairs in the World, for in le&s;s then forty
or fifty Days there is &s;old of all &s;orts of <HI>European</HI> Goods to the
value at lea&s;t of twenty Millions of Crowns ready Money. Af|ter
the Fair is done, the <HI>Galleons</HI> return to <HI>Carthagena,</HI> at which

After this, they go to the <HI>Havana</HI> to take in nece&s;&s;ary
Provi&s;ions for this Voyage, and from thence they are common|ly
two Months in Sailing to <HI>Cadiz.</HI> But as to the <HI>Flota,</HI> it
&s;tops at <HI>Porto Rico</HI> to refre&s;h, and arrives at <HI>Vera Cruz</HI> in five
Weeks, there they unload their Merchandizes, which is after|wards

City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> the Sale of them is quickly over, and the <HI>Flo|ta</HI>
parts afterwards to go to the <HI>Havana;</HI> but this mu&s;t be pa&s;t

<P>There's a certain Duty which is called <HI>Avarie,</HI> and it is ta|ken
for all Goods Regi&s;tred, and for all the Silver which is
brought from the <HI>Indies.</HI> This Duty is &s;o con&s;iderable, that
it &s;uffices to fit out the <HI>Galleons</HI> and the <HI>Flota</HI> for their Voyage,

<HI>Captain</HI> does al&s;o advance Money to the <HI>King</HI> proportionable
to the bigne&s;s of the Ve&s;&s;el they command. There goes more|over

<HI>Carthagena.</HI></P>
<P>Within the&s;e few Years, there is di&s;covered Seventy Leagues

There is at <HI>Poto&s;i</HI> greater plenty of <HI>Mines</HI> than any where el&s;e,

from thence, it is &s;ent to <HI>Callao.</HI> It is one of the Ports of <HI>Lima,</HI>
whether the <HI>Galleons</HI> come to fetch it. The Kingdom of <HI>Peru</HI>
yields every Year in Gold and Silver to the Value of eleven
Millions of Crowns. From <HI>New Spain</HI> is brought five Millions

<P>How is it po&s;&s;ible for me, continued <HI>Don Augu&s;tine,</HI> to ex|pre&s;s
to you the Beautifulne&s;s of the City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> the Church|es,
the Palaces, the Publick Places, the Riches, the Profu&s;ion,
the Magnificence and the Plea&s;ures, a City that is &s;o happily
Scituated that in all Sea&s;ons it enjoys a continual Spring, and
where the Heats are not at all exce&s;&s;ive, where they feel not
the Severity of Winter. The Country is no le&s;s charming, and
Flowers and the Fruits at all times equally loading the Trees.
There you gather more than one Crop in a Year; the
Lakes and Ponds are full of Fi&s;h, the Grounds are well &s;tockt
with Cattel, the Fore&s;ts and Woods afford excellent Fowl and
wild Bea&s;ts, the Earth &s;eems to open her Bowels on purpo&s;e
to give up the Gold &s;he enclo&s;es, there are Mines or Rocks of
precious Stones di&s;covered, and Pearl are there taken. Oh!
&s;aid I, let us all go dwell in that Country. This De&s;cription
Charms, but as 'tis a long Voyage it may be convenient, if
you plea&s;e, Madam, &s;aid I, to <HI>Donna There&s;a</HI> in &s;miling, to
get our Supper before we go; I immediately took her by the
hand, and we came into a Parlour, where I had provided the
be&s;t Mu&s;icians, which are bad enough, and which in my Opi|nion,
have nothing to recommend them but their dearne&s;s. My
Cook made us &s;ome <HI>Ragous</HI> after the <HI>French</HI> way, which <HI>Donna
There&s;a</HI> found &s;o excellent, that &s;he de&s;ired I would let her
have the Receipt how to do them. <HI>Don Augu&s;tin</HI> intreated me
al&s;o, to let him have &s;ome of my <HI>Larding Pins,</HI> of which really
one may look all over <HI>Spain,</HI> and not find &s;o much as one. We
tarryed very late together, for in this Sea&s;on they &s;et up till
four or five a Clock in the Morning becau&s;e of the heats, and
that the be&s;t time is in the Night.</P>
<P>There are certain days in the year, that every body goes
out to take the Air upon the Bridges which cro&s;s the River
<HI>Man&s;anarez;</HI> but at pre&s;ent all Coaches are laid up, the Gravel
and &s;ome little Brooks help to make it very cool and plea&s;ant.
The Hor&s;es endure a great deal in the&s;e Walks, for nothing
can be more prejudicial to their Feet than the Flints upon
which they continually tread. In certain places of this River
they make a &s;tand, and there remain till two or three a Clock
in the Morning; there is very often a thou&s;and Coaches: Some
particular People bring Victuals to eat there, and others &s;ing
and play upon &s;everal In&s;truments; all this is very plea&s;ant in
a fine Night: There are &s;ome Per&s;ons which wa&s;h or bath

$line$
<HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ively from Father to Son. Here's one thing very
&s;ingular, and that which is not allowed of in any other Coun|try;
and that is, That <HI>Foundlings,</HI> or Children found by chance
are reckoned <HI>Noble,</HI> and bear the Title of <HI>Hidalgos,</HI> and enjoy
all the Priviledges annext to the Nobility; but to this end,
they mu&s;t prove, that they were <HI>Foundlings,</HI> and were main|tained
and bred in the <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> where &s;uch Children are kept.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Spain</HI> &s;ome great Families which hold almo&s;t all
their E&s;tates by the Title of <HI>Mayorargo;</HI> and when it happens
that all of the Name are dead, and that the next akin is a Male,
though he be a natural Son, yet he &s;hall inherit, and for want
of &s;uch, the elde&s;t Dome&s;tick &s;hall take the Name and the Arms
of his Ma&s;ter, and inherit his E&s;tate: And this is one rea&s;on
why the younger Brothers of others Hou&s;es, as Noble and Illu|&s;trious,
do not &s;corn to be Servants to the&s;e, and their hopes
are pretty well grounded; for it often happens that Families
are extinct, becau&s;e the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women have fewer Children
than the Women of other Countries.</P>
<P>There lately happened a very great misfortune to a young
Woman of Quality called <HI>Donna Clara;</HI> &s;he could not pre&s;erve
her Heart again&s;t the Charms of <HI>Count de Ca&s;trillo,</HI> a Man of
the Court, very witty and hand&s;ome; the <HI>Cavellero</HI> had the &s;e|cret
to plea&s;e her without de&s;igning it; he was ignorant of the
Inclinations &s;he had for him, and &s;o did not improve his Happi|ne&s;s:

an angry look, <HI>That it is not to me you ought to addre&s;s your &s;el$
upon &s;uch a de&s;ign $word$ yours. Here take the $etter which I will
not &s;o much as open.</HI> The <HI>Count</HI> had too much Wit not to ap|prehend
pre&s;ently the favourable intention of this fair one.
You need not complain, Madam, &s;ays he to her, that I have not
made u&s;e of your Advice; he quickly withdrew to read a Let|ter
which mu&s;t needs give him abundance of Plea&s;ure: by this
means he was informed of <HI>Donna Clora's</HI> Intentions, and what
he mu&s;t do to &s;ee her. He omitted nothing, he became de&s;|perately
in Love, and thought him&s;elf, as he had rea&s;on, one
of the happie&s;t <HI>Cavalleros</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> They impatiently expected
the return of her Father, that they might propo&s;e the Marriage
to him, which in all likelihood mu&s;t have been very acceptable
to him.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all the Precautions that the&s;e young Lo|vers
took both certainly to fix and continue a Conver&s;ation,
which was the Joy of their Life; yet the &s;u&s;picious and watch|ful
<HI>Henriques</HI> di&s;covered their Intreague. He believed her Cri|minal,
and in the exce&s;s of his Rage, without &s;ignifying or ma|king
the le&s;t &s;hew, he one Night went into the Chamber of
the unfortunate <HI>Donna Clara,</HI> and as &s;he was in a deep &s;leep, he
&s;trangled her in the mo&s;t barbarous manner imaginable.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="211">
Neverthele&s;s, though it was known, that he was the Author
of &s;o wicked an Action, yet he was not pro&s;ecuted, for he had
too much Credit and Intere&s;t; and be&s;ides, this poor Gentle|woman
had no kindred but what was his, and they were un|willing
to encrea&s;e the Misfortunes of their Family, which were
already but too great.</P>
<P>After this wicked Fact, <HI>Henriques</HI> feigned a great fit of Devo|tion;
he appeared no more in Publick, and had <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> &s;aid at his
Hou&s;e, and &s;aw very few People; for he was very apprehen&s;ive
that <HI>Count Ca&s;trillo</HI> (who had not di&s;&s;embled his Grief, but had
let it vi&s;ibly appear) would at la&s;t be revenged for his Mi&s;tre&s;s,
for indeed he mo&s;t carefully &s;ought all Opportunities. At length,
after having attempted all imaginable ways, he found out one
which &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>He di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf like an <HI>Aguador,</HI> that is, a Water-bearer,
the&s;e &s;ort of People load an A&s;s with &s;everal great Pitchers, and
&s;o carry them about the City; they wear thick coar&s;e Cloath,
their Legs are naked, and their Shooes are either cut or &s;la&s;ht,
or el&s;e they have Soals made fa&s;t with Strings. Our Lover thus
di&s;gui&s;ed waited all day long, leaning upon the &s;ide of a <HI>Spring|well,</HI>
who&s;e Waters he increa&s;ed by his Tears; for this <HI>Well</HI> was
ju&s;t again&s;t the Hou&s;e where he had &s;o often &s;een his dear and
fair <HI>Clara,</HI> and there it was al&s;o, where the inhumane <HI>Henriques</HI>
dwelt. As the <HI>Count</HI> kept his Eyes continually upon this Hou&s;e,
he perceived one of the Ca&s;ements half open, and at the &s;ame
time his Enemy to draw near it, he had a Looking-Gla&s;s in his
Hand, in which he was looking him&s;elf. Immediately the cun|ning
<HI>Aquator</HI> threw &s;ome Cherry-&s;tones at him, in a je&s;ting
way, and &s;ome of them having hit his Face, <HI>Don Henriques</HI> af|fronted
at the In&s;olence of a Man, which appeared to him to be
only a poor <HI>Aguador,</HI> and tran&s;ported with the fir&s;t motions of
his Anger, came down alone to cha&s;tize him: But he was hard|ly
in the Street, when the <HI>Count</HI> di&s;covered him&s;elf, and draw|ing
his Sword, which for his purpo&s;e he kept hid, cryed out,
<HI>Traitor that thou art, think of defending thy Life.</HI> The &s;urprize
and the fright had &s;o amazed <HI>Don Henriques,</HI> that he was only
able to ask quarter; but he could not obtain it from this enra|ged
Lover, who came to revenge the Death of his Mi&s;tri&s;s up|on
him that had &s;o cruelly murdered her. This <HI>Count</HI> would
have found it very hard to have e&s;caped, upon his doing &s;uch an
Action ju&s;t at the door of a Man of note, and that had abun|dance
of Servants; but in that very moment that all <HI>Don Hen|riques</HI>
People were &s;allying out upon the <HI>Count,</HI> happily for
him, the Duke <HI>Duzeda</HI> came by with three of his Friends, they
<PB N="205" REF="212">
immediately came out of their Coach, and re&s;cued him &s;o &s;ea&s;o|nably,
that he made his E&s;cape, and we do not yet hear where
he is. I am concerned for him, becau&s;e I know him, and that
he is a very hone&s;t Man.</P>
<P>It is very common in this Country, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate one for &s;e|veral
Cau&s;es, and Cu&s;tom even authorizes the Fact, for every
angry Difference; for example, if one give another a Box o'th
Ear, or &s;trikes him on the Face with his Hat, his Handkerchief,
or his Glove, or has wronged him, in calling him <HI>Drunkard,</HI> or
lets drop any words that reflects on the Virtue of his Wife, the&s;e
things I &s;ay mu&s;t be no otherwi&s;e revenged than by A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion;
but they give this Rea&s;on, that after &s;uch Affronts, it
would not be ju&s;t for a Man to venture his Life in &s;ingle Com|bate
upon equal terms, where the <HI>Offended</HI> might peri&s;h by the
hand of the <HI>Agre&s;&s;or.</HI> They'll keep a revenge twenty Years
together, if they cannot &s;ooner meet with a fit Occa&s;ion to exe|cute
it: And if they happen to die before they have got Satis|faction,
they leave their Children Inheritors of their Re&s;ent|ments
as well as of their E&s;tates, and the be&s;t way for a Man
that hath given any Affront to another, is for ever to for&s;ake his
Country. I was lately told of a con&s;iderable Man, that after he
had lived twenty Years in the <HI>Indies,</HI> to avoid an ill turn from
another to whom he had given &s;ome Offence, and having un|der&s;tood
that not only he but his Son was dead, believed him|&s;elf
&s;ecure. He returns to <HI>Madrid,</HI> after he had taken care to
change his Name that he might not be known; but all this was
not able to &s;ave him, for the Grand&s;on of him that thought
him&s;elf abu&s;ed, though he was but twelve Years old, cau&s;ed this
Per&s;on to be murdered quickly after his return.</P>
<P>The Men that committed the&s;e horrid Actions are commonly
hired from <HI>Valentia.</HI> It is a City in <HI>Spain,</HI> who&s;e People are
wicked to exce&s;s; there's not any Crime which they will not de|liberately
commit for Money; they wear <HI>Stillettos,</HI> and Fire
Arms which go off without any noi&s;e. There are two &s;orts of
the&s;e <HI>Stillettos,</HI> one about the length of a &s;hort Ponyard, but
not thicker than a thick needle, and made of an excellent Steel,
&s;quare and &s;harp edged. This In&s;trument wounds mortally for
entring very deep, and making no bigger an Orifice than an
needle; no Blood comes out, nay hardly can one perceive the
place where it entred, and &s;o being impo&s;&s;ible to dre&s;s it, they
almo&s;t con&s;tantly die. The other &s;ort is longer, and no thicker
than the little finger, but &s;o hard and &s;trong that I have &s;een one
of them at one blow &s;truck through a thick Walnut-Tree Table.
The&s;e &s;ort of Arms are forbidden to be carryed in <HI>Spain,</HI> as

<P>I have been told, that a Per&s;on of Quality thinking he had
a ju&s;t cau&s;e to de&s;troy one of his Enemies, went to a <HI>Bandolero</HI>
of <HI>Valentia,</HI> and gave him a Sum of Money to murder him, but
afterwards he was reconciled to his Enemy, and being willing
to u&s;e a good Con&s;cience, he made it his fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to acquaint
the <HI>Bandolero</HI> with what had pa&s;t, that &s;o he might have a care
not to kill this Man. The <HI>Bandolero</HI> &s;eeing his Service needle&s;s,
offered to return the Money, but he that gave it, entreated him
to keep it; <HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I am a Man of Honour, I &s;hall keep
your money and I will kill your Man.</HI> The other earne&s;tly begged
him to do nothing, &s;eeing they were now Friends. <HI>Look you,</HI>
&s;ays he to him, <HI>all that I can do, is to give you your choice, whe|ther
it &s;hall be you or him, for to gain your Money hone&s;tly, there's
a nece&s;&s;ity I mu&s;t kill one of you.</HI> And notwith&s;tanding all the
Entreaties of this Per&s;on, he per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign, and execu|ted
it. It had been an ea&s;ie matter to have &s;eized him, but
there was too much danger in't, for tho&s;e <HI>Bandoleros</HI> are &s;o nu|merous
and united, that if any one of them &s;hould be executed,
the Death of him is certainly and quickly revenged. The&s;e
Wretches are never without a Li&s;t of their wicked Actions they
have committed, and count it an honour to them; and when
any one would &s;et them on work, they &s;hew that, and ask,
whether they de&s;ire them quickly di&s;patched, or to give them a
langui&s;hing Wound. The&s;e are the mo&s;t pernicious People in
the Univer&s;e. Indeed if I &s;hould tell you all the Tragical Stories
which I hear every day, you would grant that this Country is
the very Theatre of the mo&s;t horrid Scenes in the World. Love
frequently furni&s;hes the matter, either for its Satisfaction or Re|venge.
There is nothing that a <HI>Spaniard</HI> will not undertake,
nor nothing that is above either his Courage or Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid, that <HI>Jealou&s;ie</HI> is their prevailing Pa&s;&s;ion, yet they
do not pretend it &s;o much out of Love, as Re&s;entment and
Pride, for they cannot bear to &s;ee another prefer'd before them,
and every thing which contributes to affront them, makes them
de&s;perate; let the&s;e things be how they will, one thing is cer|tainly
true, that is a mo&s;t furious and barbarous Nation in this
Affair. The Women keep not company with Men; but yet
they very well under&s;tand how to write and appoint Meetings

both for them&s;elves, the Lover and the Me&s;&s;enger; but in &s;pite
of all that, by their Wit and their Money, they make a &s;hift to

It is unaccountable that Men who put every thing in practice
to &s;atisfie their Revengeful Minds, and who are guilty of &s;uch
abominable Actions, &s;hould even be &s;crupulou&s;ly <HI>Religious,</HI> at

this Character upon the whole Nation; it may be affirmed that
there's as good People as in any part of the World, and that
they are endowed with a mighty <HI>Greatne&s;s of Mind.</HI> I'll give
you &s;ome In&s;tances of this la&s;t, which perhaps though you'll
look upon as Follies, for every thing has two handles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Conne&s;table de Ca&s;tille</HI> is for certain, one of the riche&s;t
Lords of the Court in Lands; but as he has the &s;ame fault as
others like him&s;elf, which is to be carele&s;s in looking after
his Intere&s;t, &s;o he is ill furni&s;hed with Money. The Pen&s;ions
which the King allows him, as he is <HI>Doyen</HI> or Chief of the <HI>Coun|cil
of State, Conne&s;tabile of Ca&s;tille,</HI> and <HI>Grand Falconer,</HI> are &s;o
con&s;iderable, as to &s;upply all his wants, but he is &s;o haughty,
that he will not receive any thing upon that Account. He
gives the&s;e Rea&s;ons, <HI>That when a Subject has E&s;tate enough to live
upon, he ought not to be chargeable to his Prince, but ought to &s;erve
him, and e&s;teem him&s;elf happy; that to be paid for what he does
is mercenary and &s;lavi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Arcas,</HI> alias <HI>de Avero,</HI> hath like wi&s;e another ob|&s;tinate
humour, he pretends that the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> has u|&s;urped
the Crown from his Family, and therefore when he
&s;peaks of him, he never calls him any thing, but Duke <HI>de Bra|gance;</HI>
in the mean while, this Man has forty thou&s;and Crowns
a year in <HI>Portugal,</HI> of which he does not enjoy a Farthing, be|cau&s;e
he will not &s;ubmit to ki&s;s the Kings hand, nor to do him
homage.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Portugal</HI> hath &s;ent him word, that he will di&s;|pen&s;e
with his coming him&s;elf, provided he will &s;end in his
&s;tead one of his Sons, either the elde&s;t or the younge&s;t, which
he will, and that he will then let him receive his Rents; and
moreover, will pay him all the Arrears, which amount to an
immen&s;e Sum. The Duke <HI>de Avero</HI> will not &s;o much as hear it
mentioned. He &s;ays, that &s;eeing he has lo&s;t the Crown, it
would be a &s;hame for forty thou&s;and Crowns a year, to &s;ubmit
to the U&s;urper, that the greater evil takes away the &s;en$e of
the le&s;&s;er; that the Glory the King would receive from his
Homage, would exceed the profit be gets from his Revenue&punc;
<PB N="208" REF="217">
and that he would have cau&s;e to reproach him, for having done
an honour to him which was not his due.</P>
<P>The la&s;t I re&s;erve for you, is the Prince <HI>De&s;tillano;</HI> he hath
Places and Commi&s;&s;ions to di&s;po&s;e of at the <HI>Contrataction</HI> in
<HI>Seville,</HI> to the value of four&s;core thou&s;and <HI>Livers</HI> a year. He
had rather lo&s;e them, than &s;o much as &s;et his hand to the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
di&s;patches, &s;aying, it is not agreeable to the Genero&s;ity
of &s;uch a <HI>Cavallero</HI> as he is, to trouble him&s;elf to &s;ign his Name
for &s;o &s;mall a matter; for you mu&s;t know that the&s;e four&s;core
thou&s;and <HI>Livers</HI> are not in Article, it may be there is above
thirty; and when his Secretary pre&s;ents to him a di&s;patch or
grant of a Place, worth four or five thou&s;and <HI>Livers,</HI> he will
refu&s;e to &s;ign it, and alledges his Quality, always &s;aying, <HI>E&s;to
es una Mineria,</HI> that is, it is but a Trifle. The King however
is not &s;o nice in the matter, for he fills up the Places for him, and
receives the profit to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>You'll &s;ay now, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are Fools with this their
fanta&s;tick Grandeur; and perhaps you are in the right, but for
my part, and I think I know them pretty well, I am not of that
Opinion; yet neverthele&s;s I'll own, that whatever difference
can be found in comparing the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> it mu&s;t
be to our advantage; but it does not &s;eem fit for me to med|dle
in determining the matter, for my Intere&s;t is too much
concerned to let me judge impartially, but yet I am per&s;waded
that there are very few rational Per&s;ons, who would not make
the &s;ame Judgment.</P>
<P>There are fewer Strangers that come to <HI>Madrid</HI> than to any
City in the World, and they have rea&s;on; for unle&s;s they have
&s;omebody to procure them &s;ome Lodging in &s;ome private Hou&s;e,
they'll run the hazard of being very ill lodged, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
are not very ready to offer their Hou&s;es to any body, becau&s;e
of their Wives, of whom they are extream jealous. I do not
know, that in all this City, there's any more than two <HI>Inns,</HI>
whereof at one of them, they eat after the <HI>French</HI> mode; and
when the&s;e are full (which they are very quickly, being very
little) one knows not what to do; add to this, That there's no
conveniency for pa&s;&s;ing to and fro in the Town, H$ckney, or
$ired Co$ches are &s;carce enough, but one may have as many
Chairs as one will, yet it is &s;eldom that Men are carryed in
them&punc; unle&s;s they be very old or infirm. But after all, why
&s;hould Strangers come to <HI>Madrid?</HI> That which is fine&s;t and
the mo&s;t amiable, is always hid. I mean the Women, there's
no conver&s;ing with them; tho&s;e Women that may be &s;een, are
&s;uch dangerous Creatures for a Man's Health, that it mu&s;t be a
<PB N="209" REF="218">
great Curio&s;ity indeed, that a Man can re&s;olve to &s;atisfie at &s;o
much ri&s;que; yet in &s;pight of all this, the only Plea&s;ure, and
the &s;ole Enjoyment of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> is to contract &s;ome
League; even Youths of Quality that are rich, begin at the
Age of twelve or thirteen years to entertain a Concubine-Mi|&s;tre&s;s,
which they call <HI>Amancebade,</HI> for whom they neglect
their Studies, and make away with whatever they can catch up
in their Fathers Hou&s;e, but 'tis not &s;ong before tho&s;e Creatures
give them cau&s;e to repent of their Folly.</P>
<P>But that which is terrible is, That there are few Per&s;ons in
this Country, either of one or t'other Sex, and even of tho&s;e
who&s;e Quality di&s;tingui&s;hes them, that are free from that cur|&s;ed
Di&s;ea&s;e; their Children either bring it into the World with
them from their Mother's Womb, or &s;uck it from the Nur&s;e;
a Virgin may ju&s;tly be &s;u&s;pected to have it, and they are hardly
per&s;waded to be cured of it they are &s;o certain of falling again
into the &s;ame Condition. But doubtle&s;s this Di&s;ea&s;e is not &s;o
dangerous in <HI>Spain</HI> as in other Countries, for they &s;till pre&s;erve
their Hair very fine, and their Teeth very good: At <HI>Court,</HI> and
among&s;t the Women of the highe&s;t Quality, they di&s;cour&s;e of
it as they do of a Fever, or the Meagrim, and they all bear the
Di&s;temper patiently, without &s;o much as troubling them&s;elves
one minute about it. As they know not but that the mo&s;t ver|tuous
Women, and the younge&s;t Child may have it, &s;o they
never let blood in the Arm, but always in the Foot; they'll let
a Child three Weeks old blood in the Foot, and this is &s;o con|&s;tant
a Cu&s;tom among&s;t them, that unle&s;s it be &s;ome very able
Surgeon, they know not how to let Blood in the Arm. I was
indi&s;po&s;ed, and was forced to make u&s;e of the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dor's
<HI>valet de Chambre,</HI> to let me Blood in the Arm. By all
that I have told you, it is ea&s;ie to judge, that this is the <HI>Nup|tial</HI>
pre&s;ent which a <HI>Spaniard</HI> makes to his Wife, and that
though they marry, they do not quit their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, be they
never &s;o dangerous. Every time the&s;e Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es are l$t blood,
their Gallants are obliged to give them a compleat new &s;uit of
Apparel; and yet you mu&s;t ob&s;erve they wear ten or twelve
Petticoats at a time; &s;o that this cau&s;es no ordinary Expence.
The Marque&s;s <HI>de Liche</HI> under&s;tanding that his Mi&s;tre&s;s was ju&s;t
let blood, and &s;o could not tarry till the Tailor made her a &s;uit
which he intended for her, he &s;ent her one that was ju&s;t
brought home for the <HI>Marchione&s;s</HI> his Lady, who is extream
beautiful. It is a common &s;aying with him, <HI>That to be the hap|pie&s;t
Man, he would only wi&s;h a Mi&s;tre&s;s as hand&s;ome as his Wife.</HI></P>

The great Lords which return very rich from their Govern|ments
(whether for the mo&s;t part they go poor enough, and
where they pillage and extort all they can, becau&s;e they are
but for five years time) do not lay out their Money when they
come home, in the purcha&s;e of Lands; they keep it in their
Che&s;ts, and as long as it la&s;ts, they live at a great rate, for
they think it is below them to improve their Money. Following
this Method, it would be very hard for the greate&s;t Trea&s;ure
not to be quickly exhau&s;ted; but the future di&s;turbs them but
little, for every one of them hopes either for &s;ome <HI>Vice-Royalty,</HI>
or &s;ome other <HI>Po&s;t,</HI> which will effectually repair all their ill
Husbandry, and re&s;tore them to a good Condition: And it
mu&s;t be owned that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is capable both to &s;atisfie
the Ambition of his Subjects, and to reward their Services;
and indeed many of his Subjects fill up the Places of divers <HI>So|vereign
Princes,</HI> which were the mo&s;t eminent Men of their
Age.</P>
<P>The difference is very remarkable between tho&s;e <HI>Sovereigns</HI>
heretofore, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> at pre&s;ent; it is le&s;s to their
Birth, than as to their Merit; for the Families of the great
Lords are very Illu&s;trious, there's many of them that are de|&s;cended
from the Kings of <HI>Ca&s;tille, Navarre, Arragon</HI> and <HI>Por|tugal;</HI>
but yet this does not hinder &s;everal of them (for I make
an exception) from contradicting the vertue of their Ance&s;tors,
but then let's &s;ee how the&s;e are educated: They do not &s;tudy,
neither have they any able Ma&s;ters; as &s;oon as they are de&s;igned
for the Sword, no further care is taken to teach them either
Latin or Hi&s;tory; but one would think they &s;hould at lea&s;t be
taught what belongs to their Art, &s;uch as the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> to
<HI>Fence,</HI> and <HI>Ride</HI> the Hor&s;e; but they do not &s;o much as think of
the&s;e matters. Here are no <HI>Academies,</HI> nor Ma&s;ters to teach
&s;uch things; the young Men pa&s;s that time which they &s;hould
employ for their In&s;truction, in a wretched Lazine&s;s, either in
walking about, or courting &s;ome Lady; and yet in &s;pight of
all this, they are per&s;waded, that there are not any People in
the World which de&s;erve publick Admiration more than they
do. They believe <HI>Madrid</HI> to be the very Center of all Glory
and Happine&s;s, of all Arts and Sciences, and of all Delights and
Plea&s;ure; in dying, they only wi&s;h their Children the enjoy|ment
of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> and afterwards that of <HI>Madrid;</HI> by this means
you &s;ee they exalt this City above <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> with &s;o much &s;atis|faction
do they live in't. And 'tis this which hinders them from
vi&s;iting other Courts, and there acquiring that <HI>Politene&s;s</HI> which
they have not among&s;t them&s;elves, and to which they are per|fect
<PB N="211" REF="220">
Strangers. And 'tis this al&s;o which makes them &s;o eager to
return home to <HI>Madrid,</HI> let them be where they will, whe|ther
they be &s;ent by the King, or let them be there in what
Rank or Station they will; let them be never &s;o much honoured,
and heap up never &s;o much Wealth, yet the love to their Coun|try,
and the Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for that, hath &s;uch a power over
them, as to make them renounce every thing; and they had
rather choo&s;e to lead a mean poor Life, (&s;o it be not ob&s;erved)
without any Train, Grandeur or Di&s;tinction, provided it be
but at <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>It is very &s;eldom that a Father lets his Son travel abroad but
keeps him at home, and &s;uffers him to take up what Cu&s;toms
he plea&s;es; you may ea&s;ily believe, that generally the&s;e are none
of the be&s;t; for there's a certain Age, when Youth aims at no|thing
el&s;e, but to gratifie their Appetite, and enjoy Plea&s;ures.
One entices and draws another, and that which ought to be
&s;everely reproved, is authorized by the Example of tho&s;e, on
whom they depend. Add to this, That they make them marry
as one may &s;ay, as &s;oon as they are out of the Cradle.
At the Age of &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years they turn into
the World a young Man with a Wife that is but a Child, and
this at once makes him le&s;s capable to know his Duty, and puts
him upon being more debauched, becau&s;e he is his own Ma&s;ter
under no controul: By this means, he pa&s;&s;es his Life in a Chim|ney-corner,
like a Man in his decriped old Age; and becau&s;e
this gentle Sluggard is of an Illu&s;trious Family, he mu&s;t be cho|&s;en
to govern a People that mu&s;t &s;uffer through his Ignorance,
but that which is yet wor&s;e, is, That &s;uch a Man taking him&s;elf
for &s;ome great and knowing Per&s;on, acts only by his own head,
without con&s;ulting or advi&s;ing with any body, and &s;o does every
thing Aukwardly and ab&s;urdly. The Wi&s;e it may be, is not
better &s;tored with Wit and Parts, her mighty greatne&s;s, with
which &s;he prides her &s;elf, is the only thing that can make her
be regarded, and thus Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Capacity, mu&s;t be
&s;ubject to two Animals, which are made their Superiours.</P>
<P>But on the other hand, let us be ju&s;t, $and render to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI>
his due. It mu&s;t be owned, that when Heaven hath been &s;o
kind to a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> as to give him a good Education, and let
him travel and &s;ee the World, he makes a better improvement
than any body. Nature has been kinder to them than they are
to them&s;elves, they are born with more Wit than others, they
have a great quickne&s;s of Mind joyned with great Solidity, they
&s;peak and deliver their words with ea&s;e, they have a great Me|mory,
their Style is ne$t and conci&s;e, and they are quick of
<PB N="212" REF="221">
Apprehen&s;ion. It is ea&s;ie to teach them whatever they have
mind to; they are perfect Ma&s;ters in Politicks, and when there's
a Nece&s;&s;ity for't, they are temperate and laborious. Without
que&s;tion, &s;everal great Qualities may be found among&s;t them,
&s;uch as Genero&s;ity, Secre&s;ie, Friend&s;hip, Bravery, and in a
word, all tho&s;e Endowments of Mind, which go to make up a
perfect, good, and vertuous Man. And here methinks, I have
a fair opportunity to conclude this Letter, and to beget in you
an e&s;teem of the&s;e People. I &s;hould not be &s;orry, if I could
procure them this Happine&s;s; for their Manners do not &s;uit &s;o
ill with me, as with a great many others, who cry out again&s;t
them, and condemn them, before they have either examined or
known them. For my part, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that there is
here, both good and bad, as there is in all other parts of the
World.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<P>HEre's a general rejoycing &s;ince the arrival of the Mar|que&s;s
<HI>de los Balbaces,</HI> who brought certain News that the
mo&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian King</HI> had granted <HI>Mademoi&s;el</HI> to the King of
<HI>Spain.</HI> He &s;o impatiently expected the&s;e Tydings, that there
was hardly an hour pa&s;&s;ed, that he did not ask if the <HI>Courrier</HI>
was not come; and as &s;oon as he knew it, he immediately went
to hear <HI>Te Deum</HI> at our Lady <HI>de Atocha's</HI> Church. As the Ladies
do not go thither, &s;o they are content to dre&s;s them&s;elves
very fine, and place them&s;elves in their Windows. I cho&s;e
this, and I thought I &s;hould have been both choaked and blind|ed,
it was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive du&s;ty. I &s;aw the King in his Coach of
green Oyl-cloth; he had but a &s;mall attendance, for &s;ome twen|ty
Halbardiers clothed in yellow with tru&s;t breeches like the Pa|ges,
made up his Guard, marching before and behind him.
The Courtiers Coaches indeed that accompanyed him, were &s;o
numerous that they could hardly be told; the People every
where crowding, even to the tops of the Hou&s;es, cryed out
<HI>Viva el Roy Deos le Bendiga,</HI> and &s;everal added, <HI>Viva el Reina
$ue&s;tra Seinnora.</HI> There was not the lea&s;t Hou&s;e or Street with|out
<PB N="213" REF="222">
out its &s;pread Tables; every body had their Garlick, Leeks and
Onions in their hands, in&s;omuch that they perfumed the Air
with them, and they were even debauched with drinking their
Maje&s;ty's Health in Water. For dear Cou&s;en, though I have al|ready
mentioned it to you, yet methinks I may repeat it here,
That there never was People more temperate as the&s;e, e&s;pecially
in Wine; and they have &s;o &s;trange an abhorrence for tho&s;e
that are guilty of Intemperance, that by their Law, a Man that
can be proved but once to have been drunk, is refu&s;ed for being
a Witne&s;s in any Court of Ju&s;tice where he is offered, and after
a &s;harp reproof is &s;ent away. And if it happen, that one calls
another <HI>Boracho,</HI> that is <HI>Drunkard,</HI> this Injury is &s;ure to be re|venged
with Murther.</P>
<P>That Night the King was at <HI>Antocha;</HI> we illuminated all our
Hou&s;es with great Flamboys of white Wax which they call <HI>Ha|chas;</HI>
they are longer than tho&s;e that are u&s;ed in <HI>Paris,</HI> to light
the Coaches at night, but withal, they are a great deal dearer,
not only becau&s;e the Wax is brought at great Charges from o|ther
Parts of the World, but al&s;o becau&s;e there is a prodigious
quantity of it con&s;umed in <HI>Spain.</HI> And when they make Illu|minations,
they are not contented to &s;et up four or &s;ix Flam|boys,
but they mu&s;t put two in every Balcony, and two at each
Window up to the highe&s;t Story; there are &s;ome Hou&s;es which
thus require four or five hundred. Every where there were
Bonefires made, and we went to the Palace to &s;ee a <HI>Ma&s;querade</HI>
of a hundred and fifty Lords, which they &s;aid was to be there.
I cannot imagine why they call this Diver&s;ion by that Name,
for they were not all <HI>maskt;</HI> commonly they choo&s;e the
darke&s;t Night. All the Courtiers are mounted upon their fine&s;t
Hor&s;es, every Hor&s;e was covered with Silver Gauze and Hou|&s;ings
embroidered with Gold and Pearl. The <HI>Cavalleros</HI> were
cloathed in Black, with coloured Taby Sleeves, embroidered with
Silk and Bugles; they wore little Hats buttoned up with Dia|monds,
and in them a Plume of Feathers, they had rich Scarfes
and many Jewels; but with all this, their Black Cloaks and their
ugly Collars &s;trangely disfigure them. They ride a Hor&s;eback
like the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> that is, they as call it a <HI>Genita,</HI> their
Stirrups are &s;o &s;hort, that their knees are even with, and re&s;t
upon the Tops of the Hor&s;es &s;houlders. I cannot yet reconcile
my Eyes to this Fa&s;hion; they &s;ay, that thus they can better
rai&s;e and put them&s;elves forth again&s;t any that a&s;&s;aults them.
But to return to the <HI>Ma&s;querade,</HI> they all met together at an
appointed Place, which u&s;ually is at one of the Gates of the City.
The Streets through which they were to go, were all &s;trewed
<PB N="214" REF="223">
with Sand, and on each &s;ide there was a kind of Chaffing
di&s;hes &s;et upon Poles, which be&s;ides the white Wax Flamboys
gave a great Light, there were al&s;o placed &s;everal very clear
Lanthorns in Windows, which made a very fine Show. Every
<HI>Cavallero</HI> had a great many Footmen, which were cloathed in
Cloath of Gold and Silver, they went by their Ma&s;ters &s;ides with
Flamboys. The Ma&s;ters marcht four in a rank very &s;oftly, each
holding a Flamboy al&s;o, they went all over the City attended
with Trumpets, Timbrels, Bagpipes and Flutes, and when they
came to the Palace which was illuminated, and the Court co|vered
with Sand, they took &s;everal Turns, and run and pu&s;ht
again&s;t one another with a De&s;ign to throw each other down
with the&s;e tricks. Prince <HI>Alexander de Parma,</HI> who is of a
prodigious bigne&s;s fell down, and the fall of him made as great
a noi&s;e as the &s;houting of a moderate high-hill, they had much
ado to carry him off, for he was grievou&s;ly brui&s;ed with his
Fall, there were &s;everal of them with their great Spectacles
on, but particularly the Marque&s;s <HI>De A&s;torgas,</HI> who does not
only wear them for gravity &s;ake, but for need, for he is old,
but yet for all that, he is frolick&s;ome, he will be <HI>Major Domo</HI> to
the young Queen, and he is a <HI>Grandee</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>And now I &s;peak of a <HI>Grandee</HI> of <HI>Spain, Don Fernand de Toledo,</HI>
told me t'other day a thing plea&s;ant enough. His Father in
Law, who is the Marque&s;s <HI>De Palacios,</HI> lives at a horrid pro|fu&s;e
rate, for it &s;eems he is one of tho&s;e profe&s;t Gallants of the
Ladies of the <HI>Palace,</HI> and to arrive to that, one mu&s;t both
have a great deal of Wit, and &s;hew abundance of Magnificence,
I mean a certain peculiar &s;ort of Wit, that's neat and refined, he
mu&s;t have choice Phra&s;es and Expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;ome ways and
modes not common, he mu&s;t under&s;tand how to write both
in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e, and that too better than another. In a
word, one mu&s;t both talk and do in this <HI>Pallace</HI> Gallantry af|ter
quite another rate than is u&s;ed in the City. But to return
to the Marque&s;s <HI>De Palacios.</HI> There was a publick Fe&s;tival
appointed by the <HI>King,</HI> this Marque&s;s wanted Money to ap|pear
there, he is Lord of &s;everal Towns, it came into his head
to go down po&s;t to them, a&s;&s;oon as he arrived, at the fir&s;t, he
cau&s;ed Papers to be &s;et up, That all tho&s;e of that Town
which de&s;ired to be made <HI>Grandees,</HI> &s;hould immediately come to
him. There was not either Ju&s;tice, Burge&s;s or Trade&s;man,
which was not pre&s;ently filled with vehement Ambitious de|&s;ires
for the <HI>Grandeza,</HI> his Hou&s;e was crowded with all &s;orts of
People, he agreed with them every one &s;everally in private,
and got as much as he could of them, and afterwards he made
<PB N="215" REF="224">
them all be covered before him, and gave them Patents in
Form ju&s;t as the <HI>King</HI> does, when he makes any one a <HI>Grandee.</HI>
His Invention &s;ucceeded too well in the fir&s;t Town, not to
practi&s;e it in the re&s;t. He found among&s;t them the &s;ame Di&s;|po&s;ition
to give him Money, that through his means they
might be <HI>Grandees,</HI> with this trick, he got a con&s;iderable Sum,
and away he comes, and makes a &s;plendid &s;hew at Court. But
as a Man is never without Enemies, &s;o they were &s;ome Per|&s;ons
that had a mind to make u&s;e of this plea&s;ant Frolick to
put him out of the <HI>King's</HI> Favour. His Maje&s;ty was told of it,
and the Marque&s;s ju&s;tified him&s;elf well enough, in &s;aying all
tho&s;e to whom he had granted permi&s;&s;ion to be covered before
him, being born his Va&s;&s;als, they owed more re&s;pect than to
dare to take this liberty without his leave, and that therefore he
had made them <HI>Grandees,</HI> as to him&s;elf. And after this the
thing was only lookt upon as a merry je&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Marque&s;s</HI> comes often to &s;ee us, and as he belonged to the
late Court, &s;o ye&s;terday he told me, that a famous <HI>A&s;trologer</HI>
being one day with the late <HI>King</HI> in the Terra&s;s-walk of the
Pallace, the <HI>King</HI> asked him the height of that Place, he gazed
up into the Air, and named a certain Height. The <HI>King</HI> pri|vately
ordered them to rai&s;e the Pavement of the <HI>Terra&s;s</HI> about
three or four fingers, and in the Night it was done. The next
Morning he cau&s;ed the <HI>A&s;trologer</HI> to come to him, and being up|on
the Terra&s;s with him, &s;ays he to him, <HI>I</HI> &s;poke la&s;t night of
the height you told me of this Walk, but there was &s;ome that
maintained that you were mi&s;taken. Sir &s;ays he, I dare &s;ay, I
was not mi&s;taken. But con&s;ider it well &s;ays the <HI>King,</HI> and after|wards
we'll make him a&s;hamed, which boa&s;ts him&s;elf to be a more
knowing man than you. Immediately he began again to make
his Ob&s;ervations, the <HI>King</HI> &s;aw him change his colour, and &s;eem
to be at a great lo&s;s, but at la&s;t he drew nigh the <HI>King,</HI> and
&s;aid, what I told your Maje&s;ty Ye&s;terday was true, but to day
I find that either the <HI>Terra&s;s</HI> is rai&s;ed, or the Heavens are &s;unk
down a little lower. The <HI>King</HI> &s;miled, and told him the trick
he had put upon him.</P>
<P>That I may give you an Account of others matters. I mu&s;t
tell you that the <HI>King</HI> has in his Family three Per&s;ons which
by way of Eminency are called, the great Officers, the <HI>Mayor
Domo Mayor,</HI> the <HI>Sumiller of the Body,</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e.</HI>
The&s;e three Places are thus di&s;tingui&s;ht, the <HI>Mayor Domo</HI> com|mands
in the <HI>Palace,</HI> the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Sumiller</HI> of the Body,
is in the <HI>King's</HI> Chamber, and the Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, orders
all things in every Place, except the <HI>Palace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="225">
After the&s;e come the Gentlemen of the <HI>Kings</HI> Bed-chamber,
they wear at their Girdle for a mark of their Dignity, a gold|en
Key. There are three &s;orts of the&s;e Keys; the fir&s;t, gives
the Employment of the Gentleman of the Bed-chamber; the
&s;econd, the Entrance with the Employment; and the third is
called <HI>Clava Capona,</HI> which only gives Entrance into the Anti-chamber.
The Number of the&s;e Gentlemen is great, there are
Forty of tho&s;e for Service, which take it in turns every day,
and for the mo&s;t part they are <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> The <HI>Mayor
Domo,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Steward</HI> in Ordinary, have the &s;ame
Acce&s;s as the Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber. The Per&s;ons of
highe&s;t Quality fill up the&s;e Places, for the mo&s;t part they are
the &s;econd Sons of the <HI>Grandees,</HI> they wait in turns every
Week, and when the High-Steward is ab&s;ent, they are inve&s;t|ed
with his Power, the&s;e al&s;o introduce <HI>Foreign</HI> Mini&s;ters when
they have Audience, there are eight of them, &s;ometimes more,
but &s;eldom fewer.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> hath three Companies for his Guards, but they
have not any thing that agrees with one another. The Mar|que&s;s
<HI>De Falces</HI> commands the <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> or <HI>Burgundian</HI> Guard, it
con&s;i&s;ts of a hundred <HI>Halbardiers,</HI> and although here, they call
them the Yeomen of the Guard, yet they may be called the Life
Guard; the <HI>German</HI> Guard con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ame Number, <HI>Don
Pedro De Arragon</HI> is Captain of it, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Guard is al&s;o com|po&s;ed
of a hundred Halbardiers, and are commanded by the
Count <HI>De los Arcos.</HI> He is likewi&s;e Captain of another Company
of a hundred <HI>Spaniards,</HI> called the Guards of the <HI>Lancilla,</HI> and
this never appears, but at great Ceremonies, and at the Funerals of
Kings. The Affairs of the State are managed by a chief Mini&s;ter
which they call <HI>Privado,</HI> he hath under him a Secretary of
State, who&s;e Office is in the Pallace. All Bu&s;ine&s;s that comes
to the King and the Mini&s;ter, ought not to pa&s;s directly through
his hands, and as he di&s;patches al&s;o what ever the King orders,
&s;o he is called <HI>Secretario del de&s;pacho Vniver&s;al.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Council</HI> of State, and divers other <HI>Councils</HI> examine all
matters, and the <HI>King</HI> or the <HI>Chief Mini&s;ter,</HI> afterwards de|termine

<P>Be&s;ides this Council, which is the principal, there is that
of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition of War,</HI> of the Orders of <HI>Arragon,</HI> of the <HI>In|dies,</HI>
of <HI>Italy,</HI> of <HI>Hazienda,</HI> of the <HI>Croi&s;ado,</HI> and of <HI>Flanders,</HI>
there is al&s;o the Chamber of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> of the <HI>Alcades de Corta,</HI>
of the <HI>Contraduria, De Apo&s;ento, Delas Bo&s;ques Reales, De Mil|liones,</HI>
and <HI>De Competancias.</HI> But do not think, dear Kin&s;wo|man,
that the Salleries and Profits of tho&s;e Places are &s;mall.
For in&s;tance, The Coun&s;ellors of the Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI>
make from eighteen to twenty thou&s;and Crowns a Year of their
Places. And here it is pertinent to tell you, that 'tis thought
no Places are &s;old in this Country, at lea&s;t it is not known; in
all appearance they are be&s;towed upon Merit or Birth, but yet
under&s;tand, there are &s;uch con&s;iderable Pre&s;ents made, that
to get a <HI>Vice Royalty,</HI> they'll give Five thou&s;and Pi&s;tols, and
&s;ometimes more. That which would be called <HI>Bying</HI> in ano|ther
Countrey, at <HI>Madrid</HI> is termed giving a <HI>Regalio,</HI> that is,
making a Pre&s;ent, and one is equivalent to the other, with this
difference, that a Place, or a Government which one <HI>buys,</HI> is
yours as long as you live, and &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;es by Inheritance
to your Children, either by natural Right, or the Conce&s;&s;ion
of the Prince; but in <HI>Spain</HI> they enjoy a Place which co&s;t
them very dear, only three or five Years at mo&s;t. It is ea&s;ie
to believe that tho&s;e who advance &s;o much, are very certain
to reimbur&s;e them&s;elves both Principal and Intere&s;t. From
this Practice the People are horribly oppre&s;t, they have perpe|tually
upon them, either a new <HI>Vice Roy,</HI> or Governour, which
comes from draining him, of all the ready-Money which he
could either make of his own and &s;ometimes of his Friends, to
bribe the <HI>Court.</HI> Thus he comes hungry, and he has but a &s;hort
time to enrich him&s;elf, and &s;o the poor People are on all hands
pillaged, without &s;o much as being able to have their Com|plaints
heard. But it is yet quite another thing in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
where Gold is &s;o plentiful, and they are &s;o far from the <HI>King</HI>
and his Mini&s;ters. It is certain they bring from thence im|men&s;e
Sums, as I think, I have already intimated to you, even
the <HI>Religious</HI> as they call them, who are &s;ent to preach there,
return not without forty and fifty thou&s;and Crowns, which
they have heaped up in four or five Years time; &s;o notwith|&s;tanding
their <HI>Vow of Poverty,</HI> they find out the &s;ecret of grow|ing
rich; and during their Life they are &s;uffered to enjoy the
Fruit of their <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="227">
The <HI>Mona&s;teries</HI> here, have yet another piece of Craft, which
commonly &s;ucceeds, when a <HI>Religious</HI> Per&s;on or <HI>Fryer</HI> happens
to be the only Son, if his Father is rich, they beg him to
leave his E&s;tate to the <HI>Convent,</HI> where his Son has taken the
Habit, upon condition that he &s;hall manage and enjoy it whil&s;t
he lives, but after his Death that the <HI>Mona&s;tery</HI> &s;hall inherit it,
and put up Prayers and &s;ay <HI>Ma&s;&s;es</HI> for the Father and the Son.
By this means there are profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Fryars</HI> which have ten thou|&s;and
Crowns a Year, at their di&s;po&s;al. This Affluence in a
Country where rea&s;on has but little power over the Affections,
does not always make them more holy; and if there are any
that u&s;e it well, there are abundance which abu&s;e it.</P>
<P>It is known, that every year there comes from the <HI>Indies,</HI> a|bove
five and thirty Millions of Crowns, but yet not a quarter
part of this ever goes into the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain's</HI> Coffers. The&s;e
Trea&s;ures &s;pread them&s;elves over all <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>French, Engli&s;h,
Dutch,</HI> and the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> draw away the be&s;t &s;hares of it. Methinks,
this does not &s;uit with the refined Policy of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to
wa&s;te their own Subjects in digging Gold out of the Mines, to
let other Nations, with whom they are often at War, reap the
Profit; but the natural Lazine&s;s which hinders them from wor|king,
and having no Manufactures of their own, obliges them
to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e who can furni&s;h their Country with
the Merchandizes they want.</P>
<P>As Strangers dare not venture to go there, becau&s;e it is upon
no le&s;s penalty than hanging, &s;o they contrive to &s;end their
effects in the Names of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchants, with whom
they meet with all the Fidelity imaginable; and if the <HI>King</HI>
would, he could not hinder Strangers from receiving what is
properly theirs; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon this occa&s;ion, had
rather loo&s;e their Lives, than any wrong &s;hould come to ano|ther.
There's one thing remarkable, and that is, when the
<HI>Flota</HI> comes to an Anchor at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> there are Men who make
publick profe&s;&s;ion to a&s;&s;i&s;t in cheating the <HI>King</HI> of his Cu&s;toms
upon Silver and other Merchandizes. It is as much their Trade
and livelihood, as for a Banker to deal in Money. They call
them <HI>Metadors;</HI> and as much Knaves as they are towards the
<HI>King,</HI> yet one mu&s;t do them the right to &s;ay, they are not &s;o
to the private men which agree with them for a certain reward,
&s;ecurely to lodge their Silver in &s;uch a place of the City as
they &s;hall de&s;ire. And this practice is &s;o certain and &s;afe,
that one never hears of any that have violated their Tru&s;t: It
were ea&s;ie to puni&s;h the&s;e men for the Frauds they are guilty
<PB N="219" REF="228">
of again&s;t the <HI>King,</HI> but there would be inconveniences to the
prejudice of Trade, perhaps far greater, than the Puni&s;hments
would bring Advantage; &s;o that the Government and Magi|&s;trates
take no notice of what pa&s;&s;es. There might al&s;o be an
ea&s;ie remedy found out to hinder the <HI>King</HI> from lo&s;ing all upon
this occa&s;ion; and that is, to abate the Duties a little, which
indeed are very high, and &s;o what is given to the&s;e <HI>Metadors,</HI>
and &s;omewhat more, might be paid to the <HI>Contrataction,</HI> for na|turally
the Merchants do not love cheating, and are continually
afraid of paying at once, what they have been &s;aving for
half a &s;core Voyages; but 'tis humour of the <HI>Spaniards, To have
all or nothing,</HI> and very often they have <HI>nothing.</HI> As to <HI>Madrid,</HI>
it is impo&s;&s;ible to find there any greater Robbers and Cheats
than the Magi&s;trates and Officers them&s;elves; the&s;e are the Men,
that with Impunity appropriate to them&s;elves the <HI>Kings</HI> Cu&s;toms,
and who cheat him after &s;uch a rate, that 'tis no wonder if he
&s;o often wants Money: but they are not &s;atisfied with cheating
their <HI>Sovereign,</HI> they mu&s;t al&s;o abu&s;e and pillage the <HI>People;</HI>
and although the Laws of this Nation are not only very ju&s;t,
but equitable, yet no Body &s;eems to be &s;en&s;ible of them:
Tho&s;e very Per&s;ons into who&s;e Hands they are put, and who are
&s;et on purpo&s;e to execute them, are the fir&s;t that break and cor|rupt
them.</P>
<P>If you'll but give Money to an <HI>Alcade,</HI> or to an <HI>Alguazil,</HI>
you may have the mo&s;t innocent Per&s;ons in the World arre&s;ted
or &s;eized, and then thrown into &s;ome na&s;ty dark hole of a
Pri&s;on, and there peri&s;h with hunger, without any proceeding
or coming to a Tryal, and without any Order and Decree; and
when the poor wretch is let out of Pri&s;on, he mu&s;t not &s;o much
as think of doing him&s;elf right again&s;t this wicked Officer of
Ju&s;tice. This &s;ort of People are generally much favoured e|very
where, but here they are beyond all mea&s;ure, and righteous
<HI>Judges</HI> in this Country are more &s;carce than in any Country
whatever.</P>
<P>Thieves, Murderers, Poy&s;oners, and the greate&s;t Criminals
imaginable, remain &s;afe and quiet at <HI>Madrid,</HI> provided they
are not rich, for if they be, they are &s;ure to be di&s;turbed for the
&s;ake of that.</P>
<P>They do not judge <HI>Criminal</HI> Matters above twice or thrice a
year; it is with the greate&s;t difficulty that they bring them|&s;elves
to cau&s;e any Criminal to dye, who is, &s;ay they, a man
like them, their Country-man, and the <HI>King's</HI> Subject; they
&s;end mo&s;t either to the Mines, or to the Gallies, and when a|ny

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t Riches, and the exce&s;&s;ive haughti|ne&s;s

cannot be &s;ufficiently prai&s;ed. Upon the fir&s;t Command, they
depart, they return, go to Pri&s;on, or into Bani&s;hment, with|out
murmuring. It is not po&s;&s;ible to find a more perfect Sub|mi&s;&s;ion
and Obedience, nor a more &s;incere Lover, than that of

the other <HI>Kingdoms</HI> or <HI>Provinces</HI> are not &s;o loaded, but boa&s;t
them&s;elves for the mo&s;t part, that they are a free People, and
pay what they had a mind to.</P>
<P>I have already hinted to you, dear Cou&s;en, that in every
thing they exactly follow the <HI>Politicks</HI> of <HI>Charles</HI> V. without
con&s;idering that the difference of times makes a mighty altera|tion
in the Events of things, although they may &s;eem to be
alike, and in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances; and that what with|out
the imputation of ra&s;hne&s;s might have been undertaken
120 years ago under a flouri&s;hing reign, would be impudent
to practi&s;e now under a Reign that is far le&s;s &s;o: but a Vanity
that is natural to them, hinders them from &s;eeing, that <HI>Pro|vidence</HI>
&s;ometimes permits <HI>Empires,</HI> as well as particular <HI>Fami|lies</HI>
to have their Revolutions and Periods. The <HI>Spaniards</HI>
believe them&s;elves to be ju&s;t the &s;ame People, and in the &s;ame
Circum&s;tances they ever were; but though I never knew their
Ance&s;tors, yet I dare &s;ay they deceive them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But not to make any farther Reflexions, which perhaps are
too &s;erious and high for me, I will tell you, that here's a ge|neral
rejoycing at <HI>Madrid</HI> for the arrival of the <HI>Flota</HI> from
the <HI>Indies.</HI> As 'tis not their humour here to trea&s;ure up
Wealth, &s;o this prodigious quantity of Silver, which comes
all at a lump, is &s;pread over all the World. One would think
that the&s;e immen&s;e Sums co&s;t nothing, and that it is Money
which chance &s;ent them. Hereupon the great <HI>Lo$ds</HI> &s;ummon
<PB N="221" REF="230">
their Creditors, and pay them with a profu&s;ene&s;s, which yet
without lying, has &s;omething in't that is both noble and very
generous; for there are but few Countries where Liberality is
&s;o natural, as 'tis in this; and I mu&s;t al&s;o add, that they are
patient even to admiration. They have been known to endure
mo&s;t long and toil&s;ome <HI>Sieges,</HI> in which be&s;ides the Fatigues
of War, they had nothing to &s;upport them but Bread made of
rotten Corn, and &s;tinking Water for their Drink; and yet
there are no Men in the World more nice about good Water.
I &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding all this, and that they have been ex|po&s;ed
to the Severities of the Weather, were half naked and
had hard Lo$ging, yet in &s;pight of all the&s;e things, they have
been found more brave and couragious, than when they en|joyed
Plenty and Pro&s;perity. It is true, that that Temperance
which is &s;o natural to them, is a mighty help to them to en|dure
hunger when they are &s;orced to it, they eat very little,
and &s;carcely will they drink any Wine. The Cu&s;tom they have
of eating all alone, contributes &s;omething to make them &s;o fru|gal;
for indeed, neither their Wives nor their Children, ever
eat with them. The Ma&s;ter has his Table to him&s;elf, and the
Mi&s;tre&s;s with her Children &s;it on the Floor upon a Carpet after
the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> and <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> way. They &s;eldom or never invite
their Friends to fea&s;t together, &s;o that they are not guilty of a|ny
exce&s;s. Upon this account it is their &s;aying, <HI>That they
only eat to live,</HI> whereas there are People, <HI>which only live to eat.</HI>
Neverthele&s;s there are &s;ome rational People, which finds this
affection too great; and as they admit of little familiarity
in Conver&s;ation, &s;o they perpetually live at a di&s;tance, and as
'twere in Ceremony with one another, without enjoying that
freedom which makes that true Union, and produces that de&s;i|rable
openne&s;s of Heart.</P>
<P>This great Retirement gives them up to a thou&s;and Illu&s;ions,
which they call <HI>Philo&s;ophy;</HI> it makes them &s;ingular, dull, fan|ta&s;tick,
melancholy and Jealous, whereas if they governed them|&s;elves
otherwi&s;e, there's nothing they would not be capable
of, &s;ince they have a wonderful vigour of Mind, an excellent
Memory, good Sen&s;e, a &s;olid Judgment, and great Patience,
than which, there needs no more to make a Man wi&s;e, to grow
in Perfection, to be agreeable in Conver&s;ation, and to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
him&s;elf from the mo&s;t Polite Nation. But they are &s;o far
from being what naturally they might be, though at never &s;o
little pains, that they affect a certain Indolency which they call
greatne&s;s of Mind; they neglect their mo&s;t important bu&s;ine&s;s,

gives them not the lea&s;t di&s;turbance; the only matter
they are not indifferent in, is Jealous; they improve that to
the utmo&s;t, the bare &s;u&s;picion is enough to make them &s;tab
their Wife or their Mi&s;tre&s;s. Their Pa&s;&s;ion of Love is always
furious, and yet the Women plea&s;e them&s;elves in it; they &s;ay,
they would not for all the mi&s;chief that may befal them, have
them le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of their unfaithfulne&s;s; that their de&s;perate
Temper is a certain proof of a true Pa&s;&s;ion, and that they
them&s;elves are not more moderate when they are in Love.
They leave nothing unattempted to be revenged of tho&s;e they
love, if they for&s;ake them without cau&s;e; &s;o that the&s;e &s;ort of
amorous Engagements have commonly a fatal end. For in|&s;tance,
not long &s;ince, a Woman of Quality, who had a cau&s;e
to complain of her Gallant, contrived to get him into a Hou&s;e
where &s;he commanded, and after &s;he had &s;ufficiently reproach'd
him, again&s;t which he did but weakly defend him&s;elf, for he
was guilty; &s;he pre&s;ented to him a Ponyard, and a Cup of poy|&s;oned
Chocolate, leaving him only the liberty which &s;ort of
Death he would choo&s;e: He did not wa&s;te one minute to move
her pitty, he very well &s;aw, that in this Place &s;he was the
&s;tronge&s;t, &s;o that he tamely drank off the Chocolate without
leaving a drop. After he had drunk it, &s;ays he to her, it had
been better if you had put a little more. Sugar in't, for the Poy|&s;on
made it very bitter; remember to do &s;o the next time
you prepare another. He was immediately &s;eized with Convul|&s;ions;
it was very violent poy&s;on, and killed him in an hours
time; and for all this Lady &s;till loved him pa&s;&s;ionately, yet &s;he
had the barbarity not to &s;tir from him till he was dead.</P>
<P>The <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, who is a very well accompli&s;hed
Man, being lately at home, they brought him word, that a
Lady covered with a Mantle de&s;ired to &s;peak with him, and that
&s;he hid her &s;elf &s;o clo&s;e, they could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ee what &s;he
was: &s;he had with her two Gentlemen U&s;hers, and a con&s;ide|rable
Attendance. He invited her to his Chamber of <HI>Audience,</HI>
and &s;he de&s;ired he would cau&s;e every body to go out. When
&s;he was alone with him, &s;he unveiled her &s;elf, and appeared to
him extream hand&s;ome. <HI>I am of an Illu&s;trious Family,</HI> &s;ays &s;he
to him, <HI>my Name is</HI> Donna Blanca de Gu&s;man; <HI>I have de&s;pi&s;ed
all the Laws of Decency, in Favour of that Pa&s;&s;ion I have for you,
I came to declare to you, my Lord, and to tell you, that I mu&s;t
needs remain here this Night.</HI> From &s;uch an impudent Speech,
the Amba&s;&s;ador could not in the lea&s;t doubt, that this was &s;ome
$word$ that had borrowed a great Name, to draw him into &s;ome
Snare, but yet with abundance of kindne&s;s, told her, that
<PB N="223" REF="232">
till now he had never thought him&s;elf unhappy in the Service
of the <HI>Republick,</HI> that he could wi&s;h he were not an <HI>Amba&s;&s;a|dor,</HI>
that &s;o he might embrace the Favour &s;he offered him; but
that being in &s;uch a Station, there was little likelyhood that he
could give Entertainment to a Per&s;on of her Eminent Quality,
that this might bring him into great trouble, and therefore
begged her that &s;he would withdraw. Immediately &s;he was like
a Fury, and after &s;he had reviled and reproached him, &s;he drew
out a <HI>Stilletto,</HI> and run upon him to have &s;tab'd him. He ea&s;ily
prevented her, and having called one of his Gentlemen, bid
him give five or &s;ix Pi&s;tols to this Woman. She &s;o little de|&s;erved
this Genero&s;ity, and it &s;o appea&s;ed her, that &s;he really
told him, &s;he was one of tho&s;e Creatures he took her for, and
that the rea&s;on why &s;he had been &s;o de&s;perate, was, that the
Gentlemen U&s;hers, who waited for her below, were her Gal|lants,
and would have broke her bones if &s;he had made no ad|vantage
of the Plot they had laid; that be&s;ides, &s;he was to
pay for the Equipage &s;he came in, which was hired purpo&s;ely
for this de&s;ign, and that &s;he had much rather have dyed, than
to have endured all tho&s;e Abu&s;es. The Amba&s;&s;ador was &s;o taken
with her plea&s;ant Confe&s;&s;ion, that he cau&s;ed ten Pi&s;tols more to
be given her; for, &s;ays he to her, &s;ince &s;o many hone&s;t Folks
mu&s;t &s;hare with you, your part will be too &s;mall. She &s;ucceeded
&s;o well here, that &s;he went directly to the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors,
but &s;he was not &s;o courteou&s;ly received there: For upon the fir&s;t
Apprehen&s;ion of her De&s;ign, &s;he and her Attendance e&s;caped
very narrowly of being entertained with the Strapado. He gave
her not a Sous, happy was &s;he that got out as &s;he came in, for
he had an aver&s;ion for all the&s;e Creatures.</P>
<P>This Morning we tarried a while in the <HI>Placa Mayor,</HI> for an
An&s;wer of a Me&s;&s;age my Kin&s;woman had &s;ent to a Gentleman
that dwelt there. In this Place Fi&s;h is &s;old, and there was a
Woman which had &s;ome little bits of Salmon to &s;ell, which &s;he
&s;aid was fre&s;h; &s;he made a horrid noi&s;e in crying it, and in
calling Cu&s;tomers to buy it, at la&s;t comes a Shooemaker, which
I knew for &s;uch, becau&s;e &s;he called him <HI>Sinior Capatero;</HI> he askt
her for a Pound of her Salmon (and by the way, you mu&s;t ob|&s;erve,
that every thing here is bought by the pound, even
Wood and Charcoal) &s;ays &s;he to him, you do not enquire after
the price, becau&s;e you think 'tis cheap, but do not deceive your
&s;elf, a&s;&s;ure you, I mu&s;t have a Crown for every pound. The
Shooemaker vext that &s;he que&s;tioned his thoughts and ability,
with an angry tone &s;aid to her, <HI>had it been very cheap I would
have had but one pound, but &s;ince 'tis dear, I'll have three,</HI> and im|mediately
<PB N="224" REF="233">
he gives her three Crowns, and then thru&s;ting down
his little Hat (for you mu&s;t know that the Trade&s;men wear
them as narrow as the People of Quality wear them broad, and
turning up his <HI>Mu&s;tachios</HI> by way of Rodamentade, he rai&s;ed
the point of his formidable Sword almo&s;t to the top of his &s;houl|der,
and haughtily lookt at us, having well ob&s;erved that we
took notice of him and overheard his Di&s;cour&s;e and were Stran|gers;
but the plea&s;antne&s;s of the thing lies here, perhaps the&s;e
three Crowns was all that ever this vain-glorious Fool had in the
World, that this was his whole Weeks profit, and that to morrow,
him&s;elf, his Wife and poor Children, would have a more &s;evere
Fa&s;t, than with Bread and Water, but &s;uch is the vain humour
of the&s;e People here, nay there are &s;ome of them which will
take the legs of a Capon, and will let them hang down under
their Cloaks, that they may look as if they really had a Capon,
whil&s;t they have nothing but the Legs and Feet.</P>
<P>You cannot &s;ee a Joyner, a Sadler, or other &s;ort of Shop|keeper,
without his Velvet and Sattin Suit like the Kings, with
his long Rapier and Dagger, and his Guattar hang up in his
Shop. They work as little as ever they can, for I have more
than once told you, that they are naturally lazy. Indeed no|thing
but <HI>over-ruling Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> drives them to do any thing at all,
and then they work upon Sundays and other Fe&s;tivals, without
any &s;cruple, as well as upon any other Days, and afterwards
they carry their Goods abroad. If 'tis a Shoomaker and he has
two Prentices, he takes them both with him, and each of them
carry a Shooe, nay if he has three, they mu&s;t all go along with
him, and 'tis with much ado, that he'll &s;toop to try the Shooes
he made; when he has done, he goes and &s;its him down in the
Sun (which is call'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Fire) with a Company of &s;uch
Idle Fellows as him&s;elf, and there with a &s;overeign Authority
they determine matters of State, and Settle the Intere&s;t of Prin|ces;
very often they fall out about them, &s;ome one of them
that takes him&s;elf to be a more able Politician than the re&s;t, will
have them yield to his Judgment, but another as conceited as
him&s;elf will not &s;ubmit, and &s;o they fall together by the Ears
without Mercy. I was two days ago to &s;ee the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Emba&s;|&s;adors
Lady, and there was brought in thither a poor Wretch
which was ju&s;t then wounded in the Street; he was a Co&s;ter|monger,
and it &s;eems had maintained that the <HI>Grand Senior</HI>
would not be reckoned a cunning Politician if he did not cau&s;e
his Brother to be &s;trangled; another to whom that young Prince
was not &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing, &s;tood up in his defence, and thereupon
the&s;e two fell a fighting; but after all to give them their due,
<PB N="225" REF="234">
all the&s;e People talk of Government and Politicks with a great
deal of Judgment, and give good Rea&s;ons for what they &s;ay.</P>
<P>Here is in this City &s;everal Hou&s;es which are a &s;ort of Acade|mies,
where People meet &s;ome to Play, and others for Conver|&s;ation.
They play there with great hone&s;ty, and let them lo&s;e
what Sum they will upon Honour, they never fail to pay it in
twenty four hours. If there &s;hould be any failure, their Ho|nour
and Reputation is for ever lo&s;t. No rea&s;on what&s;oever
will be admitted again&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of paying in that time.
They play there very high and very fairly, without noi&s;e or
&s;hewing the lea&s;t vexation or concern: If they win, it is the Cu|&s;tom
to give the <HI>Barato;</HI> this I think is al&s;o u&s;ed in <HI>Italy,</HI> that is
to &s;ay, you give Money to tho&s;e that are pre&s;ent, to &s;ome more
to others le&s;s, and this whether you know them or no. He to
whom you pre&s;ent the <HI>Barato</HI> mu&s;t never refu&s;e it, let him be a
hundred times richer and better Quality than the Donour, nay
one may demand it of a Game&s;ter that is winning, and he'll not
deny to give it. There are People that have no other Sub&s;i&s;tance
than this, but yet this is no good Cu&s;tom, for though a Man does
win, yet &s;ometimes he hardly carries any thing of his gains away
with him, and if he begins to play again, he often lo&s;es his own.</P>
<P>Further, if a Man is found to have cheated, he has as good
betimes to for&s;ake all Company; for no hone&s;t Per&s;on will
have any thing to do with him, and if he is taken in the fact,
he may think him&s;elf happy if he comes off with &s;ome <HI>Cuchilla|des,</HI>
that is, &s;ome Cuts, but not Thru&s;ts with a Sword.</P>
<P>As to the Conver&s;ation in the&s;e Academies, there's of it that
is very ingenious, and very knowing Per&s;ons that frequent them,
for in a word they are here ju&s;t as in other Places, and there
are &s;ome that write very fine things. What they call <HI>Novels</HI>
&s;eem to me to be of a Stile, and to have an Air that charms,
they never advance any thing but what's probable, and the Sub|jects
they take is &s;o well managed, and their Narration &s;o con|ci&s;e
and plain, neither mean nor lofty, that one mu&s;t needs
grant they have a Genius, which &s;urpa&s;&s;es all others, in the&s;e
&s;ort of pieces. I will endeavour to get &s;ome of this kind, and
will tran&s;late, and &s;end them to you, that &s;o you may judge of
them your &s;elf. As I have not capacity enough to &s;peak of
things which treat of more &s;ublime matters, &s;o &s;hall I &s;ay no|thing
of them till I have been informed by tho&s;e that are com|petent
Judges, and then I &s;hall only pretend to be their Eccho.
But after all I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that I think them extravagant in
their Elogies, and that in them they keep not near to probabi|lity,
their Imagination, which is very lively and active, &s;ome
<PB N="226" REF="235">
times runs too fa&s;t. I was t'other day reading in a Book, where
&s;peaking of <HI>Philip</HI> the VI. the Author &s;aid, that his Virtues and
great Qualities were &s;o many, that there was not Paper enough
in the World to write them down; that a common Pen was not
worthy to de&s;cribe &s;uch divine things, and therefore they de|&s;erved
to be writ by the Rays of the Sun upon the &s;urface of the
Heavens. You'll grant me that this is really lo&s;ing a Mans &s;elf
in the Clouds, and that with endeavouring to exalt his <HI>Hero,</HI>
our poor Author fell and breaks his own Neck. Their Books
are very ill printed, their Paper is not white, and they are very
ill bound, being cover'd with Parchment or Sheep-skin Leather.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget to tell you one thing, and 'tis very material,
and that is the Policy of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which per&s;wades them
rather to be at the charge of a hundred fal&s;e Informations, than
to neglect the Opportunity of receiving one true Advice: nei|ther
the di&s;tance of the Country from whence they come, nor
their Agents are &s;u&s;pected by them, they will know every thing
and liberally recompen&s;e tho&s;e that &s;erve them, nay they'l hardly
tarry till the Service is accept'd, before they will reward them. You
cannot believe how much advantage this Maxim has gain'd them,
they have been &s;ometimes taken for Fools, but that has not di&s;|couraged
them, and in the end they always had what they in|tended.
It is likewi&s;e true, that though they have but very
&s;lender ground to beg a Favour of the King, yet provided they
are not di&s;heartened with Repul&s;es, but pur&s;ue their fir&s;t De&s;ign
with Per&s;everance, &s;ooner or later they obtain what they wi&s;ht
for. The Mini&s;ters of State think it not &s;uitable to the Grandeur
of &s;o mighty a Monarch to refu&s;e a &s;mall matter, and tho' there's
but little Ju&s;tice in pretending to a favour which one has not de|&s;erved
by &s;ome Service, yet if it is &s;ued for without intermi&s;&s;ion,
it is always obtained. I &s;ee Examples of it every day.</P>
<P>I have not yet told you, dear Co&s;en, that upon my Arrival
here all the Ladies did me the Honour to vi&s;it me fir&s;t. It is
the Cu&s;tom here to prevent Strangers, when once they know
they are of Quality and their good Conduct, concerning both
which they are very nice. When I returned them their Vi&s;it,
every one made me a Pre&s;ent; &s;ometimes in one Hou&s;e I re|ceived
a Dozen, for even the Children of four Years old will
treat you. I was pre&s;ented with great Baskets of guilt Silver, a|dorned
with Coral curiou&s;ly wrought in Flowers; the&s;e are
made at <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Millan:</HI> I had al&s;o amber Boxes &s;et with
Gold, ennamell'd and full of Pa&s;trils; divers pre&s;ented me
with Gloves and with Silk-Stockings and Garters in abundance,
but the&s;e Gloves are &s;ingular, in that they are as &s;hort as the
<PB N="227" REF="236">
Mens, for the Women wear their Sleeves down to their Wri&s;ts,
the Fingers are &s;o long that they look as if they were nothing
el&s;e, and are ridiculous. The Stockings are made of <HI>Polo,</HI> that
is raw Silk; they are made &s;o &s;hort and &s;o little in the Foot,
that I have &s;een &s;everal Babies that they would not fit; the
Garters are of a broad Ribbond, made very light and thin, like
tho&s;e our <HI>Pea&s;ants</HI> give at their Weddings; they are trimed at
each end with &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Thread Lace. They pre&s;ented me
al&s;o with &s;everal Cups of that Mineral Earth, and a thou&s;and
other things of this kind. If ever I go from hence, and make
another Journey hither, it will be my turn to pre&s;ent: But
alas! any thing plea&s;es them, Needles, Pi$s, a little Ribbond,
but above all, any thing made of their fal&s;e Stones ravi&s;hes them
with Joy; they that have &s;o many that are right and &s;o excel|lent,
yet wear a prodigious quantity of the&s;e fal&s;e ones, which
in reality are nothing neither, but bitts of Gla&s;s &s;ett, and ju&s;t
like tho&s;e our Chimney-&s;weepers &s;ell to our <HI>Provincials,</HI> who
never &s;aw more than their <HI>Curate</HI> and their Flock. The Ladies
of the greate&s;t Quality are loaded with the&s;e fal&s;e Stones which
they buy at dear rates; and when I askt them why they were &s;o
fond of the&s;e counterfeit Diamonds, they told me it was becau&s;e
they could have of them as big as they de&s;ired. And indeed
they have of them in their Pendants, as big as an Egg, and all
the&s;e come to them either from <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Italy;</HI> for as I have
told you, few things are made at <HI>Madrid,</HI> Idlene&s;s reigns too
much there.</P>
<P>There's no good Painters in this City, the greate&s;t part of
tho&s;e that draw, are not of this Country; they are either <HI>Flem|mings,
Italians</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> which come and &s;ettle here; but yet
they do not grow rich, for Money does not come and move in
the circle of Trade. For my part, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, I never
&s;aw le&s;s &s;tirring. My Kin&s;woman receives pretty con&s;iderable
Sums all in <HI>Quartos;</HI> it is <HI>Copper</HI> Money, and as na&s;ty as our
<HI>Doubles;</HI> but as bad as 'tis, yet it comes out of the <HI>Royal</HI> Trea|&s;ures;
it is delivered by Weight (for how is't po&s;&s;ible to count
&s;uch &s;orry &s;tuff?) and Men bring it upon their backs in great
matted Baskets; when the&s;e &s;ort of Payments come, the whole
Hou&s;e is employed for eight days together in taking an Account
of the&s;e <HI>Quartos</HI> in three or four thou&s;and Crowns, there's not
a hundred Pi&s;tols, either in Gold or Silver.</P>
<P>They have here great numbers of Slaves, which are bought
and &s;old at great rates, the&s;e are <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Turks;</HI> there are
&s;ome of them worth four or five hundred Crowns, heretofore
they had power of Life and Death over them, a <HI>Pat$on</HI> might
<PB N="228" REF="237">
have killed his Slave as he might have killed his Dog, but it was
thought that the&s;e Barbarities did not agree with the Maxims
of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and now that Practice is forbid, but
yet they beat them till they cripple them, without ever being
called to account for't. It's true, there are but few Ma&s;ters that
are thus &s;evere; and if a Man happen to love his female Slave,
and &s;he grants his de&s;ires &s;he becomes immediately free. As
to the other Dome&s;ticks it would be &s;omewhat dangerous to
u&s;e them ill; they pretend for the mo&s;t part, to be of as good
Families as the Ma&s;ters they &s;erve; and if they &s;hould be a|bu&s;ed,
they would be in a capacity to revenge them&s;elves, either
by Treacherou&s;ly Murdering, or Poy&s;oning of them, there are
many Examples of this, they &s;ay, that a Man ought not to in|&s;ult
over them, becau&s;e they are poor, that though they are
reduced to &s;erve, yet they have not renounced their Honour,
and that they &s;hould forfeit it, if they &s;hould take blows from
any body whatever.</P>
<P>The Beggars are even proud, and when they ask an Alms, it
is an imperious and domineering way; if one refu&s;es them,
it mu&s;t be done civilly, in &s;aying to them, <HI>Cavallero, Per|done,
u&s;$ed no tanga moneda;</HI> that is, Pardon me <HI>Cavallero,</HI> I
have no Money. If you give them a rough Denial, they'll be|gin
to argue with you, and undertake to prove to you, that
you do not de&s;erve that E&s;tate God has ble&s;t you with, and
will never let you alone, but if one &s;peaks courteou&s;ly to them,
they &s;eem well enough content and de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are naturally gentle and kind; they marry
their Slaves, and if it be with another Slave, the Children they
have are not free, but like their Fathers, are &s;ubject to the <HI>Pa|tron,</HI>
but if the&s;e Children marry, their I&s;&s;ue &s;hall not be Slaves.
And &s;o it is, if a Woman Slave marry a Free-man, their Chil|dren
follow the Condition of the Father. One is mighty well
&s;erved by the&s;e unhappy Wretches, they are far more diligent
laborious and humble than other Servants, there are few of
them that will change their Religion. I have one that is not
above nine years old, &s;he is as black as Jett, and would be
reckoned in her own Country a wonderful Beauty, for her No&s;e
is quite flat, her Lips prodigiou&s;ly thick, her Eyes of a white
and red colour, and her Teeth admirable in <HI>Europe</HI> as well as
in <HI>Africa.</HI> She under&s;tands not a word of any other Language
than her own, her Name is <HI>Zayde,</HI> we have got her baptized,
this young Chri&s;tian has been &s;o u&s;ed to throw off her white
$antle, and to be quite naked when &s;he was expo&s;ed to &s;ale,
that I have had much ado to hinder her from doing &s;o now.
<PB N="229" REF="238">
and t'other day, when we had a great deal of Company, I &s;ent
for her, and truly Mrs. <HI>Zayde</HI> was plea&s;ed to appear before them
all with her little Black Body as naked as &s;he was born. I am
re&s;olved to have her whipt, to make her know that this &s;ort of
fa&s;hion does not plea&s;e me, for there is no other way to make
her under&s;tand. Tho&s;e that &s;old her to me, told me &s;he was
a Girl of <HI>Quality,</HI> and the poor Child will come often and fall
down on her Knees before me, hold her hands together, cry,
and point towards her Country. I would willingly &s;end her
thither, if &s;he could there be a Chri&s;tian; but this impo&s;&s;ibility
obliges me to keep her. I would fain under&s;tand her, for I be|lieve
&s;he is witty, all her Actions &s;hew it, &s;he dances after her
fa&s;hion, and 'tis &s;o plea&s;antly, that &s;he makes us very merry. I
make her wear white Patches, with which &s;he is mightily taken.
She is dre&s;t as they are at <HI>Morocco,</HI> that is, with a &s;hort Gown
almo&s;t without any plights, great Shift-&s;leeves of fine Cloth,
&s;triped with different colours, like tho&s;e of our <HI>Bohemians</HI> or
<HI>Gyp&s;ies,</HI> a pair of Stays which are only made of a &s;lip of Crim|&s;on
Velvet with a gold ground, and are made fa&s;t at the &s;ides
with &s;ilver Buckles and Buttons, and a Mantle of very fine
white woollen &s;tuff very large and long, in which &s;he wraps her
&s;elf, and with one corner of it covers her Head. This dre&s;s is
hand&s;ome enough, her &s;hort Hair, which looks like Wool, is
cut in &s;everal places, on each &s;ide like a Half-moon, on the
Crown a Circle, and before a Heart; &s;he co&s;t me twenty
<HI>Pi&s;tols,</HI> my Daughter hath made her Governe&s;s of her <HI>Marmo|&s;ett;</HI>
it is the little Monkey which the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Burgos</HI>
pre&s;ented to her. I do a&s;&s;ure you, that <HI>Zayde</HI> and the <HI>Marmo|&s;ett</HI>
are well met, and under&s;tand one another very well.</P>
<P>But to come to other things, here's arrived a Man which has
been fetched from the farthe&s;t parts of <HI>Galicia,</HI> he is &s;uch a
Saint, that he has done many Miracles, as 'tis pretended: The
Marchione&s;s <HI>de loz Veloz,</HI> heretofore Governe&s;s of the King,
was like to dye, and &s;he &s;ent to have him come in all ha&s;te, but
they were &s;o long upon the Journey, that &s;he was well again
before he came. It was known what day he would arrive, and
while &s;he was then expecting him, <HI>Don Fernand de Tolledo,</HI> who
is her Nephew, and had not &s;een her &s;ince his return from
<HI>Flanders,</HI> becau&s;e of her having been &s;ick, knowing that &s;he was
then much better, happened to go to her Hou&s;e much about the
time the Saint of <HI>Galicia</HI> was to be there. The Marchione&s;s's
People &s;eeing him, and not knowing him at all (for he had
been ab&s;ent &s;everal years) without con&s;idering that there were
few Men of his Age and Looks &s;o happy as to work Miracles,
<PB N="230" REF="239">
concluded, at fir&s;t &s;ight, that he was the Saint: immediately
they threw open the great door, and rung the Bell for the &s;ig|nal,
as the Marchione&s;s had ordered them; all the <HI>Duennas</HI> and
the maids came to receive him with every one a Wax-Candle
in her hand; &s;everal of them fell upon their Knees, and would
not let him &s;tir till he had given them his ble&s;&s;ing. He thought
they made a fool of him, to give him &s;uch a reception; he
knew not whether he was bewitched, or whether he dreamt,
and do what he could, he could not per&s;wade him&s;elf that all
this was real, it was to no purpo&s;e to talk to them, they mind|ed
him not at all, the noi&s;e and the crowd was &s;o great; they
brought their Beads to touch him, and tho&s;e that were far off
him, threw them at his Head, with a hundred Medals fa&s;tened
to them. The mo&s;t zealous began to cut his Cloak and his
Cloaths, and now his fear began to be very great, le&s;t through
a de&s;ire to multiply his <HI>Relicks,</HI> they did not cut him to pieces.
The Marchione&s;s <HI>de Loz Veloz,</HI> who was carried between four in
a great Elbow-Chair, came to meet the Holy Man: and truly
when &s;he perceived the mi&s;take, and &s;aw it was her Nephew,
&s;he fell a laughing &s;o loud and &s;o long, that &s;he far exceeded
the &s;trength every body thought &s;he had. When he came from
her Hou&s;e, he came to &s;ee us, all torn, and ju&s;t as the devont
People had left him.</P>
<P>I &s;hould tell you, that all is mighty private and retired in this
Court; but here's the way and manner how &s;ome particular
Per&s;ons live. In the Morning as &s;oon as they are up, they
drink Water cooled with Ice, and pre&s;ently after Chocolate;
when Dinner time is come, the Ma&s;ter &s;its down to Table, his
Wife and Children, as I have already ob&s;erved, eat upon the
Floor near the Table; this is not done out of re&s;pect, as they
tell me, but the Women cannot &s;it upon a Chair &s;he is not
accu&s;tomed to it; and there are &s;everal ancient <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wo|men
which never &s;at upon one in their whole Life: they make
a light meal, for they eat little Fle&s;h; the be&s;t of their food are
Pigeons, Phea&s;ants, and their <HI>Olio's</HI> which are excellent; but
the greate&s;t Lord has not brought to his Table above two Pi|geons,
and &s;ome very bad Ragou, full of Garlick and Pepper,
and after that &s;ome Fennel and a little Fruit, when this little
Dinner is over, every one in the Hou&s;e undre&s;s them&s;elves, and
lye down upon their Beds, upon which they lay <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Lea|ther-Skins
for coolne&s;s; at this time you &s;hall not find a &s;oul
in the Streets; the Shops are &s;hut, all Trade cea&s;ed, and it looks
as if every body were dead. At two a Clock in the Winter,
and at four in the Summer, they begin to dre&s;s them&s;elves a|gain,
<PB N="231" REF="240">
then eat Sweet-meats, drink either &s;ome Chocolate, or
Waters cooled in Ice, and afterwards every body goes where
they think fit; and indeed they tarry out till eleven or twelve
a Clock at Night, I &s;peak of People that live regularly. Then
the Husband and Wife go to Bed, a great Table-Cloth is &s;pread
all over the Bed, and each fa&s;tens it under their Chin; the <HI>He</HI>
and <HI>She</HI> Dwarfs &s;erve up Supper, which is as frugal as the Din|ner,
for it is either a Phea&s;ant $en made into a Rago$, or &s;ome
Pa&s;try bu&s;ine&s;s, which burns the Mouth, it is &s;o exce&s;&s;ively
Peppered. The Lady drinks her belly full of Water, and the
Gentleman very &s;paringly of the Wine, and when Supper is
ended, each goes to &s;leep as well as they can.</P>
<P>The unmarryed, or tho&s;e who ob&s;erve but few rules with their
Wives, after they have been taking the Air in the <HI>Prado,</HI> where
in Summer they go half naked in their Coaches; I mean when
'tis dark they get a light Supper, mount their Hor&s;es, and take
a Foot-man behind them, they do this that they may not lo&s;e
him: for going in the darke&s;t Night through &s;o many Streets
very quick, how &s;hould a Foot-man be able to turn and wind,
and follow his Ma&s;ter? But they are al&s;o afraid of being a&s;&s;ault|ed
behind, the Footman having no other care than to look a|bout
him, is as it were the Sentinel, and ready to defend his
Ma&s;ter. There may be &s;ome which will do this, but mo&s;t of
them in &s;uch ca&s;es run away, for they are not &s;tout. This no|cturnal
Ramble is upon the Ladies account, they then vi&s;it
them, and to gain an Empire, they would not neglect that op|portunity.
They talk to them through the Lattice of their
Windows, &s;ometimes they go into their Gardens, and when
they can into their Chambers. Their Pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o violent, that
they'll look the greate&s;t danger in the face; they'll go to the
very place where the Husband &s;leeps, and I have been told that
they'll &s;ee one another years together without daring to &s;peak
one word, for fear of being heard. They are ignorant in <HI>France</HI>
what 'tis to love at the rate the&s;e People are &s;aid to love. And
not to mention the cares, the earne&s;t de&s;ires, the nicety, and
the devoting of them&s;elves up even to death, (for the Husband
and the Relations give no quarter) that which I admire is their
Fidelity and Secre&s;ie. It is never known, that a <HI>Cavallero</HI>
boa&s;ts of having received Favours from a Lady, they &s;peak of
their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es with &s;o much re&s;pect and value, as if they were
their Soveraigns. And on the other hand, the&s;e Ladies never
de&s;ire to oblige any other than their Gallants, they are entirely
taken up with him, and although they cannot &s;ee him in the
day time, yet they have opportunity to employ &s;everal hours
<PB N="232" REF="241">
about him, either in writing to, or &s;peaking of him with &s;ome
&s;he Friend who is privy to the Intrigue; or el&s;e in waiting all
the day long, and looking through their Lattices to &s;ee him go
by. In a word, upon all that I have been told about the&s;e Mat|ters,
I can ea&s;ily believe, that <HI>Love</HI> had its Birth in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Whil&s;t the <HI>Cavalleros</HI> are with their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, their Foot|men
look after their Hor&s;es at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Hou&s;e;
but there are very often unplea&s;ant Mi&s;chances happen to them,
for there being no nece&s;&s;ary places in their Hou&s;es, all night
long they throw that out of their Windows, which decency
hinders me from naming to you; &s;o that the amorous <HI>Spaniard</HI>
which goes &s;ilently along the Street, is many times in a na&s;ty
condition from head to foot, and though at his coming out he
was curiou&s;ly perfumed, yet he is forced to return as fa&s;t as he
can to change his Cloths. This is one of the greate&s;t Inconve|niencies
in this City, and which renders it &s;o &s;tinking and filthy,
that in the Morning, one can hardly pa&s;s along the Streets. I
&s;ay in the Morning, for the Air is here &s;o &s;ubtile and hot, that
all this na&s;tine&s;s is con&s;umed before Noon. When a Hor&s;e, or
any other Animal dies, they throw him into the Street where he
happens to be, though it were before the Pallace-Gate, and the
next day you'll find him reduced to du&s;t. They are per&s;waded,
that if they did not throw out their Filth and Carrion in this
manner into their Streets, <HI>Madrid</HI> would not be long without
the Plague, and it never is there.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides tho&s;e ways that I have mentioned, that Gallants
have to &s;ee their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, they have yet others; for the La|dies
vi&s;it one another frequently, and there is nothing more
ea&s;ie for them than to wear a Vail, and by the back door go in|to
a Chair, and be carryed where they will. And this is the more
practicable, becau&s;e all the Women agree to keep one anothers
Secrets inviolably, let there be what Differences there will a|mong&s;t
them, and let them never be &s;o angry one again&s;t ano|ther,
yet they never open their lips to make the lea&s;t Di&s;cove|ry;
their Di&s;cretion cannot be &s;ufficiently prai&s;ed. It is true
indeed, the con&s;equences would be more fatal if they did other|wi&s;e,
&s;ince they make nothing here of murthering upon a bare
Su&s;picion.</P>
<P>After this manner, the Ladies make their Vi&s;its to one ano|ther,
you mu&s;t not go to &s;ee your Friend when you have a
mind, you mu&s;t tarry till you are de&s;ired to come, and the Lady
that has a mind to be vi&s;ited, writes a Letter in the Morning,
and invites you, you are carryed in a Chair which is extream
large every way, and that they may be the lighter, they are
<PB N="233" REF="242">
made only of a thin &s;tuff hung upon a wooden frame, the&s;e
&s;tuffs are always mixt with Gold and Silver, and are very rich,
they have in them three great Gla&s;&s;es, and the top is made of
a very thin Leather, lined as the re&s;t, and it opens upwards, that
&s;o one may go in and out very conveniently; to every Chair
there's four Bearers, which relieves one another, and a Footman
carries the Hat of the foremo&s;t; for let it be what Weather it
will, he mu&s;t not be covered before his Mi&s;tre&s;s. The Lady is
&s;et as fa&s;t in her Chair, as a Diamond-&s;tone in a Ring; &s;he ei|ther
wears no Mantle or Vail then, or if &s;he does, it has a black
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lace &s;et on it, half an Ell deep very fine and dear; this
is becoming enough: &s;he has al&s;o a Coach with four Mules in
tho&s;e long Traces I have formerly mentioned, which follows
&s;oftly after the Chair, that is commonly filled with old Gentle|men-U&s;hers,
and five or &s;ix Pages, for every body has the&s;e, my
Banker's Wife has two. The Ladies never take any of their
Women with them, and though &s;everal of them are going to the
&s;ame place, yet they each of them take a Chair to them&s;elves,
and do not go together in any one of their Coaches. I hap|pened
t'other day, to be in a &s;top there was in a Street, and there
came by me fifty Chairs, and as many Coaches one after ano|ther,
they came out of the Dutche&s;s <HI>De Frias,</HI> and went to the
Dutche&s;s <HI>De &V;zeda</HI>'s Hou&s;e, I'll tell you why they went thither,
when I have fir&s;t told you that when the Lady is come to her
Hou&s;e whom &s;he goes to vi&s;it, the Chairmen carry her as far as
the Anti-chamber, the Stairs are made purpo&s;ely very wide and
low, for the greater ea&s;e, a&s;&s;oon as &s;he is &s;et down, &s;he &s;ends
away all her People and her Coach, and appoints them what
hour to come and fetch her home, which is u&s;ually between
ten and eleven a Clock, for their Vi&s;its are long enough to tire
the greate&s;t Patience.</P>
<P>There never comes any Men where they are met, a jealous
Husband would have little to do to &s;eek his Wife among them,
he would be laught at, and they would not vouch&s;afe to give
him any other Satisfaction, than telling 'him, <HI>That &s;he is where he
is not.</HI> The good Women are cunning enough, and they make
u&s;e of this liberty; for you mu&s;t know that every Hou&s;e has its
back doors, by which they can &s;teal out, and never be &s;een. Be|&s;ides
this, every one has a Brother at her Si&s;ters, a Son at her
Mothers, or a Nephew at her Aunts, and this is another pretence
they make u&s;e of to &s;ee their Lover. Love in this Country is
very ingenious, nothing is neglected to gratifie their Pa&s;&s;ion,
and the Mi&s;tre&s;s meets with Fidelity; there are Intrigues that
la&s;t one's Life, and yet there has not been an hours time lo&s;t to
<PB N="234" REF="243">
accompli&s;h them, all Opportunities are improved, and there
needs no more after &s;eeing and liking one another.</P>
<P>I was &s;ome days ago at the Marchione&s;s <HI>De Alcannizas,</HI> &s;he's
one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t vertuous Ladies of the Court, di&s;|cour&s;ing
of the&s;e things, &s;he very freely &s;aid to us, I mu&s;t needs
confe&s;s, that if a <HI>Cavallero</HI> &s;hould be conveniently alone with me
half an hour, and did not ask me all that a Man could ask, I &s;hould
re&s;ent it &s;o briskly that I could &s;tab him if I could. And would you
grant him all the Favours he might ask you, interrupted the Mar|chione&s;s
<HI>De Liche,</HI> who is young and hand&s;ome? That does not
follow, replied my Lady <HI>De Alcannizas,</HI> on the contrary, I have
rea&s;on to believe, that I &s;hould grant him nothing at all, but
then I could not reproach him with any thing, whereas if he
made no attempt upon me, I &s;hould conclude he de&s;pi&s;ed me.
There are few, I believe, but what are of the &s;ame Opinion
in this matter.</P>
<P>There's one thing I find very odd, and not to look well, me|thinks
in a Catholick Kingdom, and that is the tollerating of
Men, that keep Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;o openly, without the lea&s;t di&s;gui&s;e,
it is very true that they are forbid by the Laws, but they value not
the Laws, and only obey their own Inclinations, and yet no body
offers to call them to account, or to reprove them in the lea&s;t.
The&s;e Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es are called <HI>Amancebades,</HI> though a Man is mar|ried,
yet he mu&s;t have one of the&s;e Creatures, and often the <HI>na|tural</HI>
Children are brought up with the <HI>legitimate</HI> in the &s;ight of
the poor Wife, who patiently bears all this without &s;o much as
&s;peaking a word. It is very &s;eldom one hears of any Differences
between Husband and Wife, and yet &s;eldomer, that they &s;eparate
as in <HI>France.</HI> Of an infinite number of Per&s;ons that I know here, I
have only &s;een the Prince&s;s <HI>Duella Rocea,</HI> that does not live with
her Husband, but in a <HI>Convent,</HI> the Courts of Ju&s;tice are not
much troubled with Dome&s;tick Quarrels.</P>
<P>It &s;eems extraordinary to me that a Lady who loves, and is be|loved
by a <HI>Cavallero,</HI> is not jealous of his <HI>Amancebade,</HI> &s;he looks
upon her as a &s;econd Wife, and believes &s;he cannot &s;tand in com|petition
with her, &s;o that a Man has his <HI>Wife,</HI> his <HI>Amancebade,</HI> and
his Mi&s;tre&s;s, this la&s;t is generally a Per&s;on of Quality, 'tis &s;he that
is vi&s;ited in the Night, and for whom they venture their Lives.</P>
<P>It happens &s;ometimes that a Lady cover'd with her great plain
Mantle or Vail, and not &s;hewing any more of her Face than half
an Eye, and being ordinarily dre&s;$, becau&s;e &s;he would not be
known, and having no mind to take a Chair, walks a foot to the
place of Rendezvous, either her being little u&s;ed to walk, or ve|ry
often, her manner and way di&s;tingui&s;hes her, a <HI>Cavallero</HI> fol|lows,
and begins to talk to her, unea&s;ie to have &s;uch a Compani|on
<PB N="235" REF="244">
on which it is hard to get rid of, &s;he addre&s;&s;es her &s;elf to the fir&s;t
&s;he meets, and without farther di&s;covery of her &s;elf, I conjure
you, &s;ays &s;he to him, to hinder this importunate Man to follow me
any longer, his curio&s;ity may injure my affairs, this Reque&s;t a|mounts
to a command with a brave <HI>Spaniard,</HI> he asks him again&s;t
whom the Lady complains, why he will pre&s;s upon her again&s;t
her mind, and if he meets with an ob&s;tinate Per&s;on, the Sword
mu&s;t be drawn, and &s;ometimes they kill each other, without
knowing for whom they have &s;o expo&s;ed them&s;elves. In the mean
while, the Lady makes the be&s;t of her way, leaves them fighting
together, and goes where &s;he's expected, but the je&s;t is, that
very often this proves either to be the Husband or the Brother
that a&s;&s;erts her Cau&s;e, and by defending her from the Pur&s;uit
of the inqui&s;itive, gives her an Opportunity to enjoy the embra|ces
of her Gallant.</P>
<P>Some time ago, a young Lady who dearly loved her Husband,
being informed that he did not live &s;o regularly as he &s;hould, di&s;|gui&s;ed
her &s;elf, put on her Vail, and &s;tanding in a Street he u&s;ed
often to pa&s;s through, &s;he &s;pyed him and gave him an Opportu|nity
to &s;peak to her. After he had acco&s;ted her, &s;he began to
<HI>thou</HI> him, and 'tis commonly in this familiar way that the Wo|men
in this Country make known their Inclinations. He made a
Propo&s;al to her, which &s;he accepted, but upon condition that he
&s;hould not be de&s;irous either to &s;ee her or know who &s;he was:
he promi&s;ed he would not, and &s;o led her to a Friend of his, at
their parting he a&s;&s;ured her, that he thought him&s;elf the happie&s;t
of Men, and that Fortune had never been &s;o kind to him before,
and then gave her a very fine Ring, and begged her to keep it for
his &s;ake. I'll keep and love it dearly, and will meet <HI>thee</HI> here
again when thou wilt, &s;ays &s;he to him, for I had as good have thy
Jewels as another. When &s;he had ended the&s;e words, &s;he open|ed
her Vail, and the Husband &s;eeing 'twas his Wife, was in the
greate&s;t confu&s;ion imaginable at his Adventure; but he con&s;i|dered,
that &s;ince &s;he had &s;o well contrived the matter as to get
out of her Hou&s;e to watch him, &s;he might al&s;o find a way to
play him &s;ome other trick le&s;s plea&s;ant; and therefore to be
&s;ecure of her, he appointed two <HI>Duennas</HI> con&s;tantly to look af|ter
her, and they never after left her.</P>
<P>It happens al&s;o &s;ometimes, that when a Man's Hou&s;e is not
near the Place, where by chance he meets his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he goes
without Ceremony into the next he comes at, whether he is ac|quainted
there or no, he civilly intreats the Ma&s;ter to let him have
a Room to him&s;elf, becau&s;e he has now an Opportunity to di&s;|cour&s;e
with a Lady, which if he lo&s;es, he &s;hall not have the like
in a long time; this is enough to make the Ma&s;ter grant an Ac|commodation
<PB N="236" REF="245">
to the Gallant and his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ometimes, I
a&s;&s;ure you, 'tis the very Wife of the Fool that goes away &s;o kind|ly;
in a word, they will venture &s;trangely for an Opportunity
of &s;eeing each other, though but for a quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>I remember a <HI>French</HI> Lady, di&s;cour&s;ing of a certain Man to one
of her Friends, &s;aid, <HI>Shew me an amorous Man, and I'll &s;hew you
one ruined.</HI> This Maxim is verified here, more than in any place
in the World; a Lover or a Gallant has nothing that he can call
his own. It is no matter whether &s;he either &s;ees, or has a real
occa&s;ion for a thing, 'tis &s;ufficient if &s;he does but barely de&s;ire it,
they are never denyed any thing, and the manner of giving it, en|haun&s;es
their Liberality. I find them nothing near &s;o amicable
as our <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> but 'tis &s;aid they know how to love at a greater
rate. Be&s;ides their Behaviour is a thou&s;and times more re&s;pect|ful,
nay this extends &s;o far, that when a Man, let him be of what
Quality he will, pre&s;ents any thing or gives a Letter to a Lady,
he kneels upon one knee, and he does the &s;ame, when he re|ceives
any thing from her hand.</P>
<P>I &s;aid I would tell you, why &s;o many Ladies went to the Dut|che&s;s
of <HI>De &V;zeda's,</HI> &s;he is very amiable, and Daughter to the Duke
<HI>De O&s;&s;una,</HI> her Husband has had a Quarrel with the Prince <HI>De
Stillano,</HI> about a Lady which they both love; they drew their
Swords, and 'tis like to be an ill bu&s;ine&s;s. The King has cau&s;ed
them to be arre&s;ted, that is, they are not made Pri&s;oners, but
he has confined them to their Hou&s;es; unle&s;s they privately go
abroad in the Night to pur&s;ue their u&s;ual amorous Plea&s;ures.
And that which is &s;trange, the poor Wife mu&s;t not fet her foot
out of door as long as her Husband is under the&s;e Confinements,
though it is almo&s;t con&s;tantly for &s;ome piece of Infidelity he is
guilty of towards her. And it is the &s;ame al&s;o, if they be bani&s;ht,
or &s;ent to remain upon &s;ome of their own E&s;tates in the Country,
which frequently happens. In all the time of their Ab&s;ence, their
Wives keep hou&s;e without &s;o much as once going abroad. I have
been told, that the Dutche&s;s De <HI>O&s;&s;una,</HI> was a Pri&s;oner after this
manner for above two Years, this is the Cu&s;tom, but it makes
ones Life very dull and tedious.</P>
<P>But 'tis not only the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies, who are &s;o tired and un|ea&s;ie
here, the <HI>French</HI> find but little diver&s;ion: We are in a few
days to go to <HI>Arranjues</HI> and <HI>Toledo</HI> to ki&s;s the Queen Mothers
hand; I'll write you, dear Co&s;en, the particulars of that &s;mall
Journey, and I wi&s;h with all my Soul I were in a condition to
give you more e&s;&s;ential marks of my Affection.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>BY my la&s;t Letter, I told you, Dear Cou&s;in, that we were

the Entry of the Marqui&s;s <HI>De Villars,</HI> he made it on Hor&s;e|back
which is the Cu&s;tom here, and if a Man be hand&s;ome, it is
very advantagious for him: When the <HI>Venetian</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador
made his, it was happy for him that he was not in his Coach;
he had one that was worth twelve thou&s;and Crowns, which in
going from his Hou&s;e was overturn'd, and as it was in Winter,
the <HI>Mar&eacute;e</HI> (which is that na&s;ty black dirt that &s;tands in great
puddles in the Streets, and through which a Hor&s;e goes up to his
Girts) &s;o &s;poil'd the Velvet with a Gold ground, and the rich
Embroidery it was &s;et off with, that it could never &s;erve again.
I thought it &s;trange that for &s;uch u&s;ual Sights as the&s;e <HI>Entries</HI>
are, the Ladies &s;hould all be in their Balconies, in their rich
Apparel, and with the &s;ame earne&s;tne&s;s as if it was to &s;ee the
greate&s;t King upon earth; but they have &s;o little liberty, that
they are glad to embrace all occa&s;ions to &s;hew them&s;elves, and
as their Lovers and Gallants hardly ever &s;peak to them, &s;o they
take care to place their Coaches as near their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Balco|ny
as they can, that &s;o they may the more ea&s;ily di&s;cour&s;e with
them by their Eyes and their Fingers; this is a Practice that
is very u&s;eful to them for the under&s;tanding one anothers
Minds, and they do it more readily than with their Voice, this
&s;ilent Language &s;eems to me very difficult unle&s;s one were long
us'd to it; but they are early acquainted with it, about two
days &s;ince, I &s;aw a Girl of about &s;ix years old, and a Boy of the
&s;ame Age, which under&s;tood by this way to tell one another a
thou&s;and pretty things. <HI>Don Frederick de Cardona,</HI> who ob|&s;erv'd
them as well as I, but under&s;tood them far better, ex|plained
to me every thing they &s;aid; and if he did not add
to the Di&s;cour&s;e of the&s;e two Children, one mu&s;t need confe&s;s,
that in this Country, they are born for <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Court&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s <HI>De Palacio,</HI> the Mother of <HI>Don Fernand de
Tolleda,</HI> is one of my Kin&s;woman's be&s;t Friends; &s;he has a &s;ine
Hou&s;e call'd <HI>Igarica,</HI> upon the Banks of <HI>Xanama,</HI> and though
<PB N="238" REF="247">
this Lady is now very old, yet &s;he never was there, notwith|&s;tanding
it is but eight leagues from <HI>Madrid.</HI> It is not lookt
upon in this Country to be according to Grandeur to go vi&s;it
their Lands, except they lie in &s;ome Principality or &s;ome City,
and then they call them by the Name of their <HI>State.</HI> I chid this
Lady for her Carele&s;ne&s;s, and my Kin&s;woman engag'd her to
make one in the Company of her Daughter <HI>Donna Mariguita,</HI>
who is a little Woman, pale, fat and fair; the&s;e three Qualities
are equally rare here, and &s;he's admir'd by every body that &s;ees
her; the young Marchione&s;s <HI>De la Ro&s;a,</HI> would al&s;o be of our
Company, her Husband, with <HI>Don Fernand de Tolleda, Don San|che,
Sarmiento,</HI> and <HI>E&s;teve de Garjaval,</HI> went on Hor&s;eback;
<HI>Don Frederick de Cardonna,</HI> would have not fail'd of being there
too, had not the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Burgos</HI> writ him to come to him
in all ha&s;te: When he told it me, I de&s;ir'd him to go &s;ee the
fair Marchione&s;s <HI>De los Rios alas Huelgas.</HI> I gave him a Letter
for her, in which I taxt her with her &s;ilence, and I de&s;ir'd to
know particularly how all things went. We &s;et forward in two
Coaches the &s;ixth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> at ten a Clock at Night, in the fi|ne&s;t
Weather that could be; the Heats were &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that
unle&s;s one would venture their Lives, it was impo&s;&s;ible to tra|vel
in the day-time; but the Nights are cool, and the Coaches
are in the Summer all open; the &s;ides of the Coach were turn|ed
up quite round, with fine large Holland Curtains, trim'd
with fine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bone-lace, and ty'd with Knots of colour'd
Ribbon, and as they often change them, they look very neat.
We went &s;o &s;wift, that I was almo&s;t dead with fear lea&s;t &s;ome|thing
about our Coach &s;hould break; for it is certain, that we
might have been all kill'd a hundred times over, before the
Coachman would have known any thing of the matter, I fancy
they run &s;o, to make amends for their &s;low going in <HI>Madrid;</HI>
for even the Foot-pace of the Mules is too quick there, becau&s;e
of the ill pavement, the holes, the dirt in Winter, and the du&s;t
in Summer, with which the Streets are extreamly troubled. The
Marchione&s;s <HI>De Palacios</HI> wore a little Hat, trim'd with Feathers,
according to the mode of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies when they go into
the Country; and the Marchione&s;s <HI>De la Ro&s;a</HI> lookt very pretty
in her &s;hort clo&s;e-coat, &s;trait &s;leeves, and her other Ornaments,
upon-&s;ight of which, we cried out, that we thought her <HI>Muy
Bizzara,</HI> and <HI>M$y de Gela,</HI> that is, very gallant and very &s;plen|did.</P>
<P>It was very odd methinks that the&s;e Ladies &s;hould oblige us
in three &s;everal Places upon the Road to alight out of our
$oach, and hear the Marchione&s;s <HI>de la Ro&s;a's</HI> two Gentlemen
<PB N="239" REF="248">
play upon the Guittar, whom it &s;eems they brought on pur|po&s;e,
and it was pretty comical to &s;ee the&s;e Blades gallop with
their Guittars hanging behind their Backs. This ordinary con|&s;ort
of Mu&s;ick was neverthele&s;s ravi&s;hing to them, and they
were extreamly charm'd, with the plea&s;antne&s;s of the Country
in &s;o fine a Night. Indeed, I never &s;aw Women &s;o infinitely &s;a|tisfy'd.
We arrived at <HI>Arranjues</HI> about five a Clock in the
Morning, and I was amaz'd at its wonderful Situation; half a
League on this &s;ide the <HI>Tagus</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed over a wooden Bridge,
which is made to &s;hut up; and after that we came into &s;ome
Walks of Elm and Lyme Trees, which were &s;o high, green and
&s;hady, that the heat of the Sun is never felt. It is an extraor|dinary
thing to find &s;o near <HI>Madrid,</HI> Trees &s;o perfect in their
kind, for the Soyl is very barren, and they will not grow there;
but yet near <HI>Aranjues,</HI> one cannot perceive this defect I &s;peak
of, for all along the Walks, and near the Trees, there are lit|tle
Pits and Trenches made, into which the Water of <HI>Tagus</HI>
runs and moi&s;tens the roots of the Trees. The&s;e Avenues are
&s;o long, that when one is in the middle, one cannot &s;ee to the
end of 'em. Several Alleys come into the&s;e, and every way
make the perfect figure of a Star. People walk on the Banks
of the <HI>Tagus</HI> and <HI>Xamara,</HI> which are two famous Rivers that
environ the I&s;land in which <HI>Arranjues</HI> &s;tands, and which &s;up|plies
it with Water, and extreamly contributes to its beautiful|ne&s;s.
To &s;peak truly, I never &s;aw a more delightful place. I
mu&s;t confe&s;s the Gardens are too clo&s;e, and &s;everal of their Al|leys
too narrow, but yet it ravi&s;hes one to walk there; and at
our coming into them, I fancy'd my &s;elf in &s;ome enchanted
Palace. The Morning was cool, every where the Birds made
a &s;weet Melody, and the Waters a plea&s;ant murmuring noi&s;e,
the Trees and Hedges were loaden with excellent Fruit, and
the <HI>Parterres</HI> were cover'd with mo&s;t odoriferent Flowers, and
I enjoy'd all this in mo&s;t plea&s;ant Company. We had an Order
from <HI>Don John</HI> to be lodg'd in the Ca&s;tle, &s;o that the <HI>A$cade</HI>
receiv'd us with great Civility, and was very careful to &s;hew us
every thing that was the mo&s;t remarkable. The Fountains are
in that number, and there are &s;o very many of them, that it is
impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s through an Alley, to go into an Arbor, or
upon a <HI>Paterre</HI> or $erra&s;s without taking notice of five or &s;ix
with bra&s;en Statues, and marble Ba&s;in: The Spouts throw up
their Water to a va&s;t height, they are not fed from Springs, but
from the <HI>Tagus.</HI> Among&s;t others, I'll give you an account of
the Fountain of <HI>Diana;</HI> It &s;tands upon an a&s;cent, from whence
it is &s;een at a great di&s;tance; the Godde&s;s is in the mid&s;t, en|viron'd
<PB N="240" REF="249">
with Bucks, Does, and Dogs, and every one of them
&s;pouts out Water. A little lower is a circle of Myrrh, cut in
&s;everal fa&s;hions, and little <HI>Cupids</HI> peeping out half way, and
through the Water again&s;t tho&s;e Animals which &s;tand about the
Fountain. The Mountains of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> rai&s;es up its head in the
mid&s;t of a great Pond, with <HI>Apollo,</HI> the <HI>Mu&s;es, Paga&s;&s;ius</HI>'s
Hor&s;e, and a fall of Water which repre&s;ents the River of <HI>Heli|con.</HI>
Out of a Rock there i&s;&s;ues out a thou&s;and &s;everal Spouts
of Water, &s;ome lanching out, others winding in and out like a
Serpent upon the Surface of the Pond; &s;ome gliding gently,
and others, either falling like Flowers in the Air, or el&s;e like
Rain. The Fountain of <HI>Ganymedes</HI> is al&s;o very pretty, this beau|tiful
Child &s;itting upon <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s Eagle, &s;eems frighted with its
flight; the Bird &s;its on the top of a Pillar with its Wings
&s;pread; he throws out the Water by his Beak and his Tallons;
the Fountain of <HI>Mars</HI> is near this: That of the <HI>Harpyes</HI> is fine,
they are placed upon very high Marble Pillars; at the four cor|ners
they throw out Water every way, they &s;eem to have a
mind to drown a little Youth who &s;its in the middle of the
Fountain, picking a Thorn out of his Foot. But the mo&s;t plea|&s;ant
of all is, the Fountain of <HI>Love;</HI> this little God &s;eems to ri&s;e
with his Body all full of Darts, from every one of which comes
out a Spout of Water. The three <HI>Graces</HI> &s;it at the Feet of the
<HI>God of Love;</HI> but that which is mo&s;t extraordinary, is the Water
which falls from four high Trees like Fountains, who&s;e noi&s;e is
very delightful and &s;urprizing, it not being natural for Water
to come out of Trees.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be afraid to tire you, did I undertake to tell you the
va&s;t number of Cataracts, Falls, and Fountains of Water which
I have &s;een here, I will only in general a&s;&s;ure you, that it is a
Place worthy of the curio&s;ity and attention of every body. At
eight a Clock the Sun began to be too hot, and &s;ome went in
to the Hou&s;e, which comes far &s;hort of that Beauty it &s;hould
have, ju&s;tly to an&s;wer all the other things; and when the King
goes there, tho&s;e that attend him are &s;o ill accommodated with
Lodging, that either he mu&s;t be contented to go there in all
ha&s;te, and keep his Court a little, or el&s;e go as far as <HI>Tolledo;</HI>
for there are only two bad Inns, and a very few private Hou&s;es.
If we had not taken care before hand for Provi&s;ions, even to
Bread, I am confident we had met with none, unle&s;s the <HI>Alcade</HI>
would have given us &s;ome of his. And by the way I'll inform
you the difference there's between the <HI>Alcade</HI> and <HI>Alcalde,</HI> that
&s;o you may not confound them; the fir&s;t &s;ignifies the Gover|nor
of a Ca&s;tle or Place, and the other a Serjeant. Although
<PB N="241" REF="250">
the mo&s;t curious Pictures are at the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> yet I found &s;ome
excellent ones in the King's Apartment at <HI>Arranjues;</HI> it is fur|ni&s;ht
according to the Sea&s;on we are now in, that is to &s;ay, the
Walls are all white, have only a Matt that is very fine and thin
about three foot deep with &s;ome Looking-gla&s;&s;es and Pictures.
In this Building there are divers little Courts, which takes from
the grace of it. We eat our Breakfa&s;t all together, and they
per&s;wade me to eat &s;ome of a Fruit they call <HI>Pimento,</HI> which
is as long as one's finger, but as hot as Pepper, the lea&s;t bit of
which puts one Mouth in a Flame, they let it lie &s;teeping in
Vinegar and Salt, to get out the Virtue: This Fruit is brought
into <HI>Spain</HI> growing upon a Plant; and I never &s;aw any of it in
other Conntries where I have been. We had an <HI>Olio,</HI> &s;ome
Ragous made of cold Partridges with Oyl, Canary Wine, fat
Pullet, and Pigeons which are excellent here, and al&s;o &s;everal
&s;orts of Fruit, which was extraordinary fair. When this Repa&s;t,
which was worth a Dinner, was ended, we went to Bed, and
went not a walking till about &s;even a Clock in the Evening.
The Charms of this Place were as new to me as if I had not &s;een
them in the Morning, but particularly, I &s;till admir'd the Si|tuation,
which indeed ravi&s;hes, on what &s;ide &s;oever one turns
the Eyes. The King is there, with half a dozen of his Guards,
in great &s;afety, becau&s;e there's no getting at him but over
Bridges, which are all drawn up, and the <HI>Xamara,</HI> which in
this Place, &s;wells the Waters of <HI>Tagas,</HI> fortifies <HI>Aranjues.</HI> After
we had walkt till ten a Clock at Night, we came back into a
great Hall, paved with Marble, and &s;upported with Pillars of
the &s;ame. It was all enlightned with d$$ers brancht Candle|&s;ticks,
and <HI>Don E&s;leve de Carvajal</HI> had $$$vately got thither &s;e|veral
Mu&s;icians, which was a plea&s;ant &s;ort of a &s;urprize to us,
at lea&s;t the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies and my Kin&s;woman were mightily
delighted with them. For my part, I thought they &s;ung too
much in the Throat, and Divi&s;ions and Shakes were &s;o long,
that they were tedious; not but that their Voices are good,
but their manner of &s;inging is not good, and generally the
greate&s;t part in <HI>Spain,</HI> do not &s;ing as they do in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI>
When Supper was done, we went to the great Canal, where
there's a &s;mall <HI>Gallion</HI> painted and gilt, we went aboard her,
and tarry'd till two a Clock in the Morning, and then we &s;et
forward on our way to <HI>Tolleda.</HI></P>
<P>I took notice when we came out of <HI>Aranjues,</HI> that the ground
was all Heath and Ling, and yet the Air was perfum'd with
wild and mother Tyme, with which the&s;e Plains were all co|ver'd.
They told me there were a great many Rabits, Stags,
<PB N="242" REF="251">
Does, and Fallow Deer, but it was not then their time to ap|pear.
Our Conver&s;ation was for &s;ome time general, and for
two Leagues together from <HI>Arranjues,</HI> I did not &s;peak one
word to <HI>Don Fernand,</HI> tho' he &s;at ju&s;t clo&s;e by me; But being
willing to imploy the time, in thoroughly informing my &s;elf
about all the Particulars of the cruel <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> which he had
promis'd to acquaint me with, I de&s;ir'd him to let me know
&s;omething of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> &s;ays he, has not been known in <HI>Europe,</HI> but
&s;ince the beginning of the Thirteenth Century. Before that
time, the Bi&s;hops and <HI>Civil</HI> Magi&s;trates, enquired after <HI>Here|ticks,</HI>
and either condemn'd them to Bani&s;hment, or to the
Forfeiture of their Goods and E&s;tates, or el&s;e, to &s;ome other
Penalties, which never almo&s;t extended to <HI>Death:</HI> But the
va&s;t number of <HI>Here&s;ies</HI> which appear'd towards the end of the
Twelfth Age, caus'd that Tribunal to be E&s;tabli&s;h'd: The <HI>Pope</HI>
&s;ent &s;everal <HI>Religious</HI> Per&s;ons to the <HI>Catholick</HI> Princes and Bi|&s;hops,
to exhort them, to take an extraordinary Care, in the
Extirpation of <HI>Here&s;ies,</HI> and to bring ob&s;tinate <HI>Hereticks</HI> to
puni&s;hment: and thus things continued till the Year 1250.</P>
<P>In the Year 1251. <HI>Innocent</HI> IV. Authoriz'd the <HI>Dominican</HI>
Fryars, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> to take Cognizance
of the&s;e &s;ort of Crimes. <HI>Clement</HI> the IV. confirm'd the&s;e Tribu|nals
in the Year 1265. Afterward, there were &s;everal Courts
erected in <HI>Italy,</HI> and in the Kingdoms which were dependants
of the Crown of <HI>Arragon,</HI> till &s;uch time, that the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI>
was e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Kingdoms of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Fer|dinand</HI>
and <HI>I&s;abel,</HI> and after that in <HI>Portugal,</HI> by King <HI>John</HI> the
III. in the Year 1557.</P>
<P>To that time the <HI>Inqui&s;itors</HI> had a limited Power, and it was
often conte&s;ted by the <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> to whom the Cognizance of
<HI>Heretical</HI> Crimes belong'd. According to the <HI>Canons,</HI> it was
contrary to the Rules of the <HI>Church,</HI> for <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> to &s;entence any
Criminals to <HI>Death,</HI> much more for tho&s;e Crimes, which the
<HI>Civil</HI> Laws often puni&s;h'd with far le&s;s &s;evere Penalties: But
ancient Right yielding to new Power, the <HI>Dominican</HI> Fryars by
the <HI>Popes</HI> Bulls have been for the&s;e two Ages, in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
this extraordinary Juri&s;diction; from which the Bi&s;hops have
been excluded, the <HI>Inqui&s;itors</HI> now only wanted the Authority
of the <HI>Prince,</HI> to enable them to execute their Sentences. Be|fore
<HI>I&s;abella</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> came to the Crown, the <HI>Dominican, John
de Torquemada,</HI> her Confe&s;&s;or, and afterward <HI>Cardinal,</HI> made
her promi&s;e him to <HI>per&s;ecute</HI> all <HI>Infidels,</HI> and <HI>Hereticks,</HI> as &s;oon
as it &s;hould be in her Power to do &s;o. She prevail'd over <HI>Fer|dinand</HI>
<PB N="243" REF="252">
her Husband to obtain, in the Year 1483. <HI>Bulls</HI> from
Pope <HI>Sixtus</HI> the IV. to con&s;titute an <HI>Inqui&s;itor</HI> General, over
the Kingdoms of <HI>Arragon</HI> and <HI>Valentia,</HI> for the&s;e two Kingdoms
were his <HI>Fee</HI> held in <HI>Capite:</HI> and it is to be noted, that <HI>Fer|dinand</HI>
di&s;po&s;ed of the Places in his E&s;tates, and <HI>I&s;abel</HI> of tho&s;e
that were in hers: but the <HI>Queen</HI> got this Place for <HI>Torquemada.</HI>
Afterwards the <HI>Pope</HI> extended his Juri&s;diction over all the States
and Countries of the <HI>Catholick</HI> Kings, and then <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and
<HI>I&s;abel</HI> e&s;tabli&s;ht a Supream Council of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> of which
they made him <HI>Pre&s;ident:</HI> It is compos'd of an <HI>Inqui&s;itor-Gene|ral,</HI>
(who is nominated by the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> and confirm'd
by the <HI>Pope</HI>) of five Coun&s;ellors, whereof one is to be a <HI>Do|minican,</HI>
by a Privilege granted to this Order, in the Year
1616. by <HI>Philip</HI> the III. Of a <HI>Procurator,</HI> two <HI>Secretaries</HI> of
the <HI>King</HI>'s Chamber, two Secretaries of the <HI>Council,</HI> an <HI>Algua|zil
Mayor,</HI> a Receiver, two Reporters, and two Qualificators,
and Con&s;ulters. The Number of the <HI>Familiars</HI> and &s;mall Offi|cers
is very great, becau&s;e all that belong to the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> be|ing
not &s;ubject to or tryable by any other Juri&s;diction, &s;helter
them&s;elves from the ordinary Courts of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The <HI>Supream</HI> Council hath a full and &s;ole Authority over the
other <HI>Inqui&s;itions,</HI> which cannot perform any <HI>Auto</HI> or Executi|on,
without leave from the Great and General <HI>Inqui&s;itor:</HI> The
particular <HI>Inqui&s;itors</HI> are tho&s;e of <HI>Sevile, Tolleda, Grenada,
Cordua, Cuenca, Vailladolid, Marcia, Derena, Logronno, St. James,
Sarago&s;&s;a, Valentia, Barcelona, Majorque, Sardaigna, Palermo,
Canaries, Mexico, Cartagena,</HI> and <HI>Lima.</HI></P>
<P>Every one of the&s;e <HI>Inqui&s;itions</HI> is compos'd of three <HI>Inqui&s;itors,</HI>
three <HI>Secretaries,</HI> one <HI>Alguazil Mayor,</HI> and of three Receivers
Qualificators and Con&s;ulters.</P>
<P>All Per&s;ons that take any of the&s;e Employments upon them
are oblig'd to make out their Proofs <HI>De cau&s;a Limpia,</HI> that is,
that their Family is not &s;tain'd with any thing of <HI>Judai&s;m,</HI> or
<HI>Here&s;ie,</HI> and that they are <HI>Catholicks</HI> from the beginning.</P>
<P>The Proceedings of this Tribunal are very unu&s;ual. A man
is Arre&s;ted and lies in Pri&s;on, without knowing the Crime he
is accus'd of, or the Witne&s;&s;es which depo&s;e again&s;t him: He
cannot come out thence, unle&s;s he will own the Fault, of which
often he is not guilty, and which the de&s;ire of Liberty forces
him to confe&s;s, for they do not put one to death for the fir&s;t
time; but then the Family is markt for Infamy, and this fir&s;t
Judgment makes the Per&s;ons uncapable of any Employment.</P>
<P>There's no confronting of Witne&s;&s;es, nor any means for a
Man to defend him&s;elf, becau&s;e this Tribunal above all things
<PB N="244" REF="253">

but chiefly again&s;t <HI>Judaizing Chri&s;tians,</HI> and &s;ecret <HI>Mahomitans,</HI>
of whom the Expul&s;ion of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and
<HI>I&s;abel,</HI> has fill'd all <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;everity of this Court was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that the <HI>Inqui|&s;itor
Torquemada</HI> try'd above a hundred thou&s;and Per&s;ons, of
which &s;ix thou&s;and were condemned to be burnt in the compa&s;s
of Fourteen Years.</P>
<P>It is pretended that the &s;ight of &s;o many Criminals con|demn'd
to &s;o terrible a Death, without any regard either to
their $word$ or Quality, confirms and keeps the People in the <HI>Ro|mi&s;h</HI>

the wickede&s;t <HI>Here&s;ies</HI> from &s;preading$ them&s;elves in
<HI>Spain,</HI> even in that time when all <HI>Europe</HI> be&s;ides was infected
with them. For this rea&s;on, the <HI>Kings</HI> have given &s;uch Arbi|trary
Authority to this Tribunal, which is called the <HI>Tribunal</HI>
of the <HI>Holy Office.</HI></P>
<P>The general Acts of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> which by the greate&s;t
part of <HI>Europe,</HI> are lookt upon, only as a bare Execution of
Criminals, among&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> are e&s;teem'd a <HI>Religious</HI> Ce|remony,
by which his <HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ty gives publick Proofs of
his <HI>Zeal</HI> for Religion. And therefore, are called by 'em <HI>Autos
de Fe, Acts of Faith;</HI> commonly they are performed either
at the Acce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Kings</HI> to the Crown, or at their coming
to Age, that &s;o they may be the more Authentick: The la&s;t
was in the Year 1632. and there is one now making ready for
the <HI>Kings</HI> Marriage. As there has not been one of a long time,
&s;o there are great preparations making to render this as Solemn
and as Magnificent as 'tis po&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e &s;orts of Ceremonies
to be. One of the Coun&s;ellors of the Inqui&s;ition has already
drawn a Project of it, which he has &s;hewed me: Here's the
Contents of it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>great Place</HI> at <HI>Madrid,</HI> there &s;hall be a Theater erected
fifty Foot long; It &s;hall be rais'd as high as the Balcony, de|&s;ign'd
for the <HI>King,</HI> and no higher.</P>
<P>On the right &s;ide of the <HI>King</HI>'s Balcony, quite cro&s;s the
Theater, there &s;hall be rais'd an Amphitheater, of twenty five
or thirty &s;teps, de&s;igned for the Council of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> and
the other Councils of <HI>Spain,</HI> on the uppermo&s;t of which &s;hall
be placed the <HI>Chairs</HI> under a Canopy, for the <HI>General Inqui&s;itor</HI>
a great deal higher than the King's Balcony. On the left of
the Theater and the King's Balcony, there &s;hall be another
Amphitheater as big as the fir&s;t, upon which the Criminals
&s;hall be placed.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="254">
In the middle of the great Theater, there &s;hall be rais'd a|nother
very little one, on which &s;hall be made two Cages,
where the Criminals &s;hall be kept while their Sentence is
reading.</P>
<P>There &s;hall be likewi&s;e placed upon the great Theater, three
Chairs for the Readers of the Judgment, and for the Preacher,
before whom there &s;hall be an Altar erected.</P>
<P>The Places for their <HI>Catholick</HI> Maje&s;ties &s;hall be &s;o ordered,
that the <HI>Queen</HI> &s;hall be on the left hand of the King, and on
the right of the <HI>Queen-Mother.</HI> All the Queen's Ladies of Ho|nour,
&s;hall take up the re&s;t of the length every way of the
&s;ame Balcony; there &s;hall be other Balconies prepared for the
Amba&s;&s;adors, Lords and Ladies of the Court, and Scaffolds
for the People.</P>
<P>The Ceremony &s;hall begin by a Proce&s;&s;ion from St. <HI>Maries</HI>
Church. A hundred Charcoal-men arm'd with Pikes and
Muskets, &s;hall march before, becau&s;e they provide the Wood,
which is to burn tho&s;e that are condemned to the Fire. Next
them &s;hall follow the <HI>Dominicans</HI> with a white Cro&s;s carry'd be|fore
them; the Duke <HI>de Medina Celi</HI> &s;hall carry the Standard
of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> according to a Privilege that's Hereditary to
his Family: This Standard is of red Damask, on one &s;ide of it,
is repre&s;ented a naked Sword, in a Crown of Lawrel, and on
the other the Arms of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>After that, &s;hall be carry'd a green Cro&s;s, wrapt about with
black Crape: and after it &s;hall march &s;everal <HI>Grandees</HI> and o|ther
Per&s;ons of Quality of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> covered with Cloaks,
that have black and white Cro&s;&s;es upon them, embroidered
with Gold Thread. The march &s;hall be brought up by fifty
Halberdiers or Guards to the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI> cloathed in black and
white, and commaded by the Marquis <HI>De Pouar,</HI> Hereditary
Protector of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Tolleda.</HI></P>
<P>After the Proce&s;&s;ion has in this order pa&s;t by the <HI>Pallais,</HI> it
&s;hall come to the <HI>great Place;</HI> the Standart and the green Cro&s;s
&s;hall be fixt upon the Altar, and the <HI>Dominicans</HI> only, &s;hall
remain upon the Theater, and &s;pend part of the Night in Sing|ing
P&s;alms, and as &s;oon as day breaks, they &s;hall celebrate &s;eve|ral
<HI>Ma&s;&s;es</HI> upon the Altar.</P>
<P>The <HI>King,</HI> the <HI>Queen</HI> and the <HI>Queen-Mother,</HI> and all the La|dies
mu&s;t be in their Balconies about &s;even a Clock in the Mor|ning;
at eight, the Proce&s;&s;ion &s;hall begin to march, as it did
the day before, by the company of Charcoal-men, who &s;hall
place them&s;elves on the left hand of the King's Balcony, the
right &s;hall be for his Guards. Afterwards &s;everal Men &s;hall
<PB N="246" REF="255">
bear certain Pa&s;t-board Effigies as big as Life; &s;ome of them
repre&s;enting tho&s;e that dy'd in Pri&s;on, who&s;e Bones &s;hall al&s;o
be carr$'d in Coffers with Flames painted round them, and the
re&s;t &s;hall repre&s;ent tho&s;e who have e&s;cap'd and who have been
condemn'd for Contumacy: The&s;e Figures &s;hall be placed at
one end of the Theater. After that, their Sentence &s;hall be
read, and they &s;hall be executed. But I &s;hould tell ye, added
he, That the Supream Council of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> is more ab&s;o|lute
than all the others: It is believ'd that the King him&s;elf has
not Power to relea&s;e tho&s;e which &s;hall be accus'd before it, be|cau&s;e
this <HI>Tribunal</HI> acknowledges the <HI>Pope</HI> only to be above it,
and that there has been a time, when upon &s;ome occa&s;ions the
<HI>King</HI>'s Power, was found too weak to contend with that of the
<HI>Inqui&s;ition. Don Diego Sarmiento</HI> is <HI>Inqui&s;itor General;</HI> he is a
mighty hone&s;t and good Man; and is about three&s;core Years
of Age: The <HI>King</HI> nominates the Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI>
and his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> confirms him; But as for the <HI>Inqui&s;itors,</HI> the
Pre&s;ident propo&s;es them to the King, and after he has approv'd
of them, he then puts them in their Places.</P>
<P>This Tribunal takes Cognizance of every thing concerning
the <HI>Faith,</HI> and it is ab&s;olutely inve&s;ted both with the <HI>Pope</HI>'s
and the <HI>King</HI>'s Authority, there's no appealing from its Judg|ment;
and the two and twenty Tribunals of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI>
which are in all the <HI>E&s;tates</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> and which depend upon
this at <HI>Madrid,</HI> every Month render an Account to it, of their
<HI>Finances,</HI> and Revenues, and every Year of their Cau&s;es and
Criminals: But tho&s;e of the <HI>Indies</HI> and the other di&s;tant Places,
only give an Account at the end of every Year. As to the
Places of the&s;e inferior Tribunals, they are fill'd by the <HI>General
Inqui&s;itors,</HI> with the Approbation of the Coun&s;ellors. It would
be pretty difficult to be able preci&s;ely to reckon up the num|ber
of the Officers, which belong to the <HI>Inqui&s;ition;</HI> for in
<HI>Spain</HI> alone, there are about two and twenty thou&s;and <HI>Familiars</HI>
of the <HI>Holy Office.</HI> They are call'd by this Name, becau&s;e they
are as 'twere Spies, &s;cattered up and down every where, which
are continually giving true or fal&s;e Information to the Inqui&s;i|tion,
upon which tho&s;e are &s;eized and taken up, which they
accu&s;e.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t with the greate&s;t Attention I was li&s;tening to <HI>Don
Fernand,</HI> the Marchione&s;s <HI>De Palacios</HI> interrupted us, to let us
know that we were come near <HI>Tolleda,</HI> and that certain old
Ruines of an ancient Ca&s;tle which we &s;aw upon our left hand,
were tho&s;e of an enchanted <HI>Palace.</HI> I &s;eem'd to <HI>Don Fernand</HI>
to doubt of what &s;he affirm'd, upon which he &s;aid, you may
<PB N="247" REF="256">
think what you plea&s;e; but certain it is, that there's for it a
very ancient <HI>Tradition</HI> in this Country; and moreover, they
pretend that there is a <HI>Cave</HI> &s;hut up, and a Prophe&s;ie which
threaten'd <HI>Spain</HI> with the greate&s;t Mi&s;eries, whenever this Cave
was open'd: Every body terrify'd with this threat, had no
mind to draw upon them&s;elves the &s;aid Effects, &s;o that this
place did for &s;everal Ages remain very clo&s;e. But <HI>Don Rodigue,</HI>
the <HI>King,</HI> le&s;s credulous, or more curious, caus'd it to be o|pen'd,
upon which there were heard mo&s;t terrible Noi&s;es; e|very
body thought that the very Elements them&s;elves were go|ing
into confu&s;ion, there was &s;o violent a Tempe&s;t: This did
not hinder him from going into it, where by light of &s;everal
Flamboys, he &s;aw the Figures of divers Men, who&s;e Cloaths
and Arms were very &s;trange: There was one held a Copper
Blade in his hand, and upon it was writ in <HI>Arabick,</HI> that the
Time drew near, for the Di&s;&s;olation of <HI>Spain,</HI> and that the
Per&s;ons, who&s;e Statues were there, would ere long come. It
never was in any place, &s;aid I &s;miling, where they rely'd &s;o
much on fabulous Tales, as they do in <HI>Spain: Says rather,</HI> replied
he, <HI>that there never was any Woman &s;o incredulous as you; and
in telling you this Story, I did not think</HI> I <HI>&s;hould alter your Judg|ment;
But as much as one can be a&s;&s;ured of a thing by the Te&s;ti|mony
of Men, this Story is credible.</HI></P>
<P>It was now light enough, very plainly to ob&s;erve all the
Charms of the Country. We pa&s;t the <HI>Tagus</HI> over a very great
and fine Bridge, of which I had heard, and a little after di&s;co|ver'd
<HI>Tolleda</HI> all &s;urrounded with Hills and Rocks, which com|mand
it; There are very neat Hou&s;es built among&s;t tho&s;e
Hills, de&s;ign'd for the plea&s;ure of Solitude: The Arch-Bi&s;hop
of <HI>Tolleda</HI> has one there, whether he goes often: The City
&s;tands upon the Rock, the unevenne&s;s of which in divers pla|ces
contributes to make it high and low; the Streets are nar|row,
ill pav'd and trouble&s;ome, which is the rea&s;on, that all
the People of Quality go there, either in Chairs or Litters: And
as we were in a Coach, we took up our Quarters in the <HI>Placa
Mayor,</HI> becau&s;e that is only the part to which one can pa&s;s with
a Coach; as &s;oon as we were arriv'd, we alight at the Ho&s;pital
of <HI>Foira,</HI> which &s;tands in the Suburbs, who&s;e Buildings con&s;i&s;ts
of three Sides, within which is a great &s;quare Court, and the
Church makes up the fourth &s;ide, and there we heard <HI>Ma&s;s:</HI>
This Ho&s;pital was built by an Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Tolleda,</HI> who&s;e
Monument and Statue in Marble are in the mid&s;t of the body of
the Church: The Walls of the City were rebuilt by the <HI>Moors;</HI>
on the Sides &s;tands a great many little Towers, which hereto
<PB N="248" REF="257">
heretofore &s;erv'd to defend it; And it would be a &s;trong Place,
being almo&s;t encompa&s;t with the <HI>Tagus,</HI> and having extream
deep Ditches, did not the adjacent Hills command it, from
whence it were ea&s;ie to batter it down. It was not eight a
Clock when we got thither; and we would &s;pend the re&s;t of
the Morning in &s;eeing the Church, which as 'tis &s;aid, is the
fine&s;t in <HI>Europe:</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> call it <HI>Holy,</HI> whether 'tis upon
the Account of the <HI>Relicks</HI> which are there, or for &s;ome other
rea&s;on which they did not tell me, I know not: If it was as
long and high as 'tis broad, it would be much better. It is
beautify'd with divers Chappels as big as Churches; they all
&s;hine with Gold and Paintings; the chief of which are tho&s;e
of the <HI>Virgin,</HI> St. <HI>James,</HI> St. <HI>Martin, Cardinal Sandoual</HI> and the
<HI>Conne&s;table De Luna.</HI> In the Quire, I &s;aw a <HI>Niche,</HI> or hollow
place, from whence 'tis pretended there i&s;&s;ued out for &s;everal
days together, a Spring of Water with which the Soldiers and
Citizens quencht their thir&s;t in the time they maintain'd the
Sieges again&s;t the <HI>Moors,</HI> when they were half dead with thir&s;t.
For without digre&s;&s;ing from my &s;ubject, I mu&s;t tell you, that
in the City there is not &s;o much as a Well or a Spring, and
that they fetch all their Water from the <HI>Tagus,</HI> which is &s;o ve|ry
trouble&s;ome, that one would wonder how <HI>Tolleda</HI> comes to
be &s;o full of People as 'tis. Near the entrance into the Church,
there's a Marble Pillar, which they Reverence, becau&s;e the Holy
<HI>Virgin</HI> appeared upon't to St. <HI>Alphon&s;us.</HI> It is enclo&s;ed with
an Iron Gate, and through a little Window they ki&s;s it, and
upon it is writ, <HI>Adorabimus in loco ubi fleterunt pedes ejus.</HI> Be|tween
every <HI>Canons</HI> Seat there is a Marble Pillar, and the
Sculpture of the Church is fine and curiou&s;ly wrought. I was
amazed when I &s;aw the <HI>Trea&s;ury.</HI> There mu&s;t be thirty Men to
carry the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> upon <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti</HI> day. It is made of Sil|ver
guilt, and there is exqui&s;itely wrought upon't &s;everal Spires
of Steeples, with abundance of Angels and Cherubims: within
this, there's al&s;o another of Ma&s;&s;y-gold, and &s;uch a va&s;t quan|tity
of precious Stones that their value is ine&s;timable; the
<HI>Chalacies,</HI> the <HI>Patins</HI> and the <HI>Pyxes</HI> are no le&s;s beautiful, In|deed
every thing &s;hines there, with great Diamonds and Ori|ental
Pearls; the Sun, where the Holy Sacrament is kept, the
Crowns and Robes of the <HI>Virgin</HI> are the mo&s;t &s;plendid things, that
I ever &s;aw in my days. But indeed this Archbi&s;hoprick is &s;o
very rich, that it is but ju&s;t every thing &s;hould be an&s;wer|able
to it. I have told you, dear <HI>Cou&s;in,</HI> that the Archbi&s;hop of
<HI>Burgos</HI> informed me, that the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Tolleda</HI> had three
hundred and Fifty thou&s;and Crowns a Year. I mu&s;t now add
<PB N="249" REF="258">
that the Revenue of the Church it &s;elf, is a Hundred thou&s;and
Crowns. Forty <HI>Canons,</HI> which have every one a thou&s;and
Crowns; the Grand <HI>Arch-deacon,</HI> Forty thou&s;and, three <HI>Arch|deacons,</HI>
the fir&s;t of which has fifteen thou&s;and, the &s;econd
twelve thou&s;and, and the third ten thou&s;and, and the Dean ten
thou&s;and Crowns a Year.</P>
<P>There is be&s;ides, an infinite number of Chaplains, Clarks of
the Chappel, and other Per&s;ons, to whom daily allowances are
given.</P>
<P>There is the Chaplain <HI>Mayor</HI> of the Chapel <HI>de los Rios,</HI> who
enjoys twelve thou&s;and Crowns a year, and &s;ix others that are
under him, have a thou&s;and Crowns <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>After we had &s;pent a great deal of time in con&s;idering the
fine things with which this Court was filled, we re&s;olved to re|turn
to our Inn, where we had left our Coach; and ju&s;t when
we were going away, there came to us an Almoner and a
Gentleman that belonged to Cardinal <HI>Porto Carrero,</HI> who &s;ent
them to complement us, and to a&s;&s;ure us that by no means we
mu&s;t lodge any where el&s;e than at the <HI>Arch-bi&s;hops</HI> Palace. They
chiefly addre&s;s'd them&s;elves to the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Palacios</HI> who
was near a kin to him, and who earne&s;tly de&s;ired us to go thi|ther.
We excu&s;ed our &s;elves upon our being in &s;uch Di&s;order,
not having &s;lept that Night, and being in an undre&s;s: She or|dered
her Son to go to the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> and to beg him to accept
our excu&s;es. <HI>Don Fernand</HI> returned in a moment, attended
with abundance of Pages, &s;ome of which brought Umbrellos
of Gold and Silver Brocado. He told us that his <HI>Eminence</HI>
mightily de&s;ired we would go to his Hou&s;e, and that he had
&s;hewed &s;o much concern at our refu&s;al, that indeed he had pro|mi&s;ed
to bring us; and thereupon he commanded them to bring
Umbrellos to defend us from the Sun, and that they had
watered the place which we were to cro&s;s from the Church to
the Palace. And immediately we &s;pied two Mules drawing a
little Cart, in which there was a Tub full of Water; and we
were told that as oft as the <HI>Cardinal</HI> was to come to the Church,
it was the Cu&s;tom to water the way.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arch-bi&s;hops</HI> Palace is very ancient and large, mo&s;t rich|ly
furni&s;hed, and every way &s;uitable to the Per&s;on that po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es
it. We were conducted into a very fine Apartment, where
immediately they brought us Chocolate, and afterwards, all
&s;orts of Fruits, Wine, Water and other Liquors cooled with
Ice. We were &s;o &s;leepy, that after we had eat a little, we
begged the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Palacios</HI> to &s;ee the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> and
to excu&s;e us to him, if we defer'd giving our &s;elves that honour,
<PB N="250" REF="259">
for that we were not able any longer to live without &s;leep.
And indeed, the young Marchione&s;s <HI>de la Ro&s;e,</HI> my Kin&s;wo|man
and my &s;elf, cho&s;e to go to Bed, and in the Evening, we
dre&s;t our &s;elves to &s;ee the <HI>Queen-Mother.</HI> The Marchione&s;s
<HI>de Palacios,</HI> who had always been extreamly devoted to her,
went to the <HI>Alcacar,</HI> which is the Name of the Ca&s;tle, and
made her a vi&s;it whil&s;t we &s;lept; &s;o that &s;he told her, &s;he
would give us Audience at eight a Clock in the Evening,
that was the fir&s;t time I was dre&s;t according to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mode.</P>
<P>I do not think there's a more trouble&s;ome dre&s;s; ones Shoul|ders
mu&s;t be &s;o &s;queez'd, that it hurts one; there's no lifting up
ones Arm, hardly can you get it into the Sleeve. I had on a Far|dingal
of a dreadful bigne&s;s, (for one mu&s;t wear that in the
Queen's Pre&s;ence) I know not what to do with my &s;elf with
this &s;trange invention; there's no &s;itting down in it, and I be|lieve
if I &s;hould wear it all my Life, I &s;hould never be recon|cil'd
to it. My Head was dre&s;t after the <HI>Melene</HI> fa&s;hion, that
is, the Hair all &s;pread over the Neck, and ty'd at the end with
&s;ome Non-pareil Ribbon, this is a great deal hotter than a Pa|tine;
&s;o that being now in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and in
<HI>Spain,</HI> you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s how I pa&s;s away my time. But
this being a Ceremonial Dre&s;s of the Head, there was nothing to
be omitted upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion; be&s;ides, I wore their <HI>Patins</HI>
which are fitter to break ones Neck, than to walk with. When
we were all in a Condition to appear, for my Kin&s;woman and
my Daughter were both al&s;o dre&s;t after the <HI>Spani&s;h fa&s;hion,</HI> we
were led into a Chamber of State, where the Cardinal came to
&s;ee us; his Name is <HI>Don Luis Porto Carrero,</HI> he may be about
two and forty years old, he's very civil, is of a &s;weet complai|&s;ant
Temper, and hath well learnt the polite Breeding of the
Court of <HI>Rome;</HI> He &s;tay'd an hour with us, and afterwards
there was &s;erv'd up to us a very plentiful Meal; but every
thing was &s;o full of Amber, that I never ta&s;ted any Sauces &s;o
rich, and le&s;s plea&s;ant. I fancy'd my &s;elf at this Table, like
<HI>Tantalus,</HI> in the mid&s;t of Victuals, and yet &s;tarv'd with hunger,
becau&s;e I could not eat; for either all the Meat was perfum'd,
or el&s;e full of Saffron, Garlick, Onion, Pepper and Spices: but
with &s;earching about, I found &s;ome Jellies and white Meats,
which were admirable, and with which I &s;av'd my &s;elf harmle&s;s.
There were al&s;o brought to Table a Ham of Bacon, which came
from the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and which is better than either
tho&s;e they boa&s;t &s;o much of at <HI>Bayonn,</HI> or tho&s;e of <HI>Ments:</HI> but
it was &s;pread all over with certain little Comfits, which in
<HI>France</HI> we call Non-pareil, the Sugar of which melted in the
<PB N="251" REF="260">
Fat; it was drawn full of Limon-peel, which abated much of
its goodne&s;s. The Fruit was the be&s;t and the plea&s;ante&s;t thing
one can &s;ee, for whole Trees, with their Fruit were Iced over
with Sugar after the <HI>Italian</HI> way; you'll ea&s;ily believe the Trees
were not very big. There were Orange Trees thus order'd,
with little artificial Birds fa&s;tned in them. There were like|wi&s;e
Cherry Trees, Rasberry and Goo&s;eberry Bu&s;hes, and others
&s;et in little Ca&s;es of Silver.</P>
<P>We did not &s;it long at Table, becau&s;e the hour for &s;eeing the
Queen was near; we were carry'd thither in Chairs, though it
is a pretty di&s;tance, and very much up Hill; for the <HI>Alcacar</HI> is
built upon a Rock of a Prodigious height, and the Pro&s;pect is
admirable. Before the Gate there is a very wide Place, after|wards
one comes into a Court an hundred and &s;ixty foot long,
and an hundred and thirty broad, adorn'd with two rows of
Piazza's, ten rows of the Pillars which made the length, were
all of one entire Stone; and the breadth had eight rows of Pil|lars,
and this made a fine &s;how. But that which plea&s;es much
better, is the Stair-ca&s;e at the bottom of the Court, which is an
hundred and thirty foot wide, like the Court. After one has
gone up &s;ome &s;teps it parts in two, and to &s;peak the Truth, I
believe 'tis one of the faire&s;t in <HI>Europe.</HI> We went through a
great Gallery, and va&s;t Apartments, but met in them &s;o few
People, that it did not look as if one could have met with the
Queen-Mother of <HI>Spain</HI> there; &s;he was in a great Hall, who&s;e
Windows were all open, and which had a Pro&s;pect to the Val|leys,
and the River. The Hangings, Cu&s;hions, Carpets and Ca|nopy
were all of gray Cloth; the Queen was &s;tanding and lean|ing
upon a Balcony, having in her hand a great pair of Beads.
When &s;he &s;aw us, &s;he turn'd towards us, and received us with
a Countenance merry enough. We had the Honour to ki&s;s her
Hand, which is little, lean and white: She is very pale, her
Complexion pure, her Face a little long and flat, her Looks are
agreeable, and her Stature is of a middle &s;ize; &s;he was dre&s;t as
all the Widows in <HI>Spain</HI> are, that is, like a <HI>Nun,</HI> without &s;o
much as one Hair appearing; and there are many, (though
&s;he's not of that number) that cau&s;e all their Hair to be cut off
when they lo&s;e their Husbands, for a greater expre&s;&s;ion of their
Grief. I ob&s;erv'd that her Gown was tuck'd up quite round,
that &s;o it might be let down as it wears out; yet I do not be|lieve
&s;he practices this, but &s;uch is the fa&s;hion of the Country.
She ask'd me how long I had been come from <HI>France,</HI> and I
gave her an account; &s;he enquir'd if they di&s;cours'd then of
a Marriage between her Son and <HI>Mademo&s;elle d' Orleance,</HI> and
<PB N="252" REF="261">
I told her no; then &s;he &s;aid &s;he would &s;how me her Picture
which was drawn from that the King her Son had, and &s;he bid
one of her Ladies, who was an old Duenna, and very ugly,
bring it. It was drawn in Water Colours, in the bigne&s;s of
ones hand, in a Box covered with black Sattin, and lined with
green Velvet. Do you find, &s;ays &s;he, that it is like her? I a&s;|&s;ured
her that there were not any of her Features; for indeed
it &s;eemed to &s;quint, the Face was awry, and nothing could le&s;s
re&s;emble a Prince&s;s &s;o perfect as <HI>Mademoi&s;elle.</HI> She asked me
whether &s;he was more or le&s;s hand&s;ome than this Picture. I
told her, that &s;he was hand&s;omer beyond compari&s;on. <HI>The
King my Son then,</HI> reply'd &s;he, <HI>will be plea&s;antly cheated, for he
believes this Picture is ju&s;t like her, and no body can be better &s;a|tisfied
than he is with her. For my part, her Eyes that look askew
were trouble&s;ome to me, but to comfort my &s;elf, I con&s;idered that
&s;he had a great &s;hare of Wit, and divers other good Qualities. Do
not you remember,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, to the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Palacios, to have
&s;een my Picture in the late King's Chamber? Yes Madam,</HI> an|&s;wered
the Marchione&s;s, <HI>and very well remember al&s;o, that as &s;oon
as we &s;aw your Maje&s;ty, we all wondred extreamly, why the Pain|ter
would do you &s;o much wrong, that's what I would have &s;aid to
you,</HI> reply'd &s;he, <HI>for when I arriv'd here, and ca&s;t my Eyes upon
that Picture which they &s;aid was made for me, I in vain try'd to
believe it, but I could not do't.</HI> A little &s;he Dwarf, but thick as
a Tun, and no taller than a good big Mu&s;hroom, cloth'd all in
Gold and Silver Brocade, with long Hair hanging down to her
Feet, came in, and kneeling before the Queen, asked her if &s;he
would plea&s;e to have Supper; upon which we offered to with|draw,
but &s;he told us, we might follow her, and &s;he went into
a Parlour all of Marble, &s;he &s;at down to Table all alone, and we
all &s;tood round her. Her Maids of Honour, with the <HI>Camera
Mayor,</HI> who looked very &s;ad, came to wait on her. I &s;aw &s;ome
of them, which methinks were very hand&s;ome; they talkt to
the Marchione&s;s <HI>de Palacios,</HI> and told her, that they were hor|ribly
tyr'd with that &s;ort of Life, and that they lived at <HI>Tolleda,</HI>
as if they were in a De&s;art. The&s;e were called <HI>Damas de Pa|lacio,</HI>
and they wear <HI>Patins;</HI> but for the little <HI>Menines,</HI> they
wear Shooes quite flat; the <HI>Menines</HI> are Children of the highe&s;t
Quality, and neither wear Cloak nor Sword.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal Di&s;hes brought before the Queen, the fir&s;t
were Melons cooled with Ice, and &s;ome Sallets and Milk, of
which &s;he eat plentifully before &s;he touched any of the Fle&s;h,
which looked ill enough. She does not want a Stomach, and
&s;he drank a little Wine pure, &s;aying that was to dige&s;t her Fruit:
<PB N="253" REF="262">
When &s;he called for Drink, the fir&s;t <HI>Menine</HI> brought her Cup
covered upon a Salvar, and kneeling gave it to the <HI>Camarera,</HI>
who al&s;o kneeled when the Queen took it from her hands; and
on the other &s;ide, a Lady of the Palace pre&s;ented upon Knee a
Napkin to the Queen to wipe her Mouth with&punc; She gave &s;ome
dryed Sweet-meats to <HI>Donna Marguerita de Palacios,</HI> and to my
Daughter, in &s;aying to them, they mu&s;t not eat much of &s;uch
things, becau&s;e they &s;poiled the Teeth of young Girls. She
asked me divers times how the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Queen did, and
how &s;he diverted her &s;elf? She &s;aid, that &s;he had lately &s;ent
her &s;ome Boxes of Amber Pa&s;tils, &s;ome Gloves, and &s;ome Cho|colate:
She was above an hour and half at Table, &s;peaking little,
but &s;eemed merry enough. We de&s;ired to know her Commands
for <HI>Madrid,</HI> whereupon &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a great deal of Kindne&s;s
and Civility, and after that we took our leave of her. It cannot
be denyed, that this Queen has abundance of Under&s;tanding as
well as Courage and Vertue, to take as &s;he does, &s;o tedious a
Bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget to tell you, that the fir&s;t <HI>Menine</HI> brings the
Queens Patins and puts them on; this is &s;o great an Honour in
this Country, that they would not change it for the be&s;t place
belonging to the Crown. When the Ladies of the Palace mar|ry,
and with the Queens con&s;ent, &s;he adds to their Portions
fifty thou&s;and Crowns, and commonly &s;ome Government or
Vice-Royalty is given to their Husbands.</P>
<P>When we came back to the Cardinals Hou&s;e, we found a
Theater prepared in a mighty great Room, and abundance of
Ladies on one &s;ide, and Cavalleros on the other, and that
which &s;eemed pretty odd to me, was a Damask Curtain which
was drawn all the length of the Room to the very Theater, and
&s;o hindred the Men and the Women from &s;eeing one another:
They only &s;tayed for us, to begin the Comedy of <HI>Pyramus</HI> and
<HI>Thisbe;</HI> this was a new Play, but the wor&s;t that I have yet &s;een
in <HI>Spain.</HI> Afterward the Comedians danced very well, and
the Diver&s;ion la&s;ted till after two a Clock in the Morning.</P>
<P>There was given a &s;tately Supper in a great Hall, where
there were divers Tables; and when the Cardinal had placed
us, he went back to the Cavalleros, who had the &s;ame things
on their &s;ide as we had: There was an excellent <HI>Italian</HI> Con|&s;ort
of Mu&s;ick, for his Eminence had brought with him Mu&s;i|cians
from <HI>Rome,</HI> to whom he gave large Pen&s;ions. It was &s;ix
a Clock in the Morning before we could retire to our Apart|ments,
and as there were divers things for us yet to &s;ee, in&s;tead
of going to bed, we went to the <HI>Placa Mayor,</HI> which they call
<PB N="254" REF="263">
<HI>Secodebet;</HI> the Hou&s;es which environ it are of Brick, and all
uniform, with Balconies. It is of a round Figure, and has Pi|azzas
about it, under which People walk, and this is a fine Place.
We went back to the Ca&s;tle to view it better and more lei&s;urely,
the Building is after the <HI>Gothick</HI> fa&s;hion, and very ancient, but
there's &s;omething in't that looks &s;o great, that I do not won|der
that <HI>Charles</HI> V. had rather have lived there, than in any o|ther
City under his Obedience. It contains in a &s;quare, four
great Apartments with their &s;everal Wings and Pavilions;
there's room enough conveniently to lodge the whole Court of
a great King. We were &s;hewed a Machine that was very &s;trange
before it was broken; it was to draw up the Water from the
<HI>Tagus,</HI> and to make it ri&s;e to the top of the <HI>Alcacar,</HI> the Hou&s;e
where it &s;tood is yet whole, though it be &s;everal Ages &s;ince it
was built. There's above five hundred &s;teps from it to the
River &s;ide; when the Water was come into the Receiver, it
ran by certain Channels into all parts of the City where there
were Fountains. This was a mighty Conveniency, for now
they are forced to draw the Water thirty fathom deep.</P>
<P>We went and heard Ma&s;s in the Church <HI>de los Reyes:</HI> It is
fair and large, and all full of Oranges and Pomegranet Trees,
Ja&s;&s;amin and Mirtles that are very high, and they are &s;et in Ca&s;es,
and are formed into walls up to the very high Altar, who&s;e Or|naments
are extraordinary rich, &s;o that looking through all the&s;e
green Boughs, and the Flowers of different Colours, upon the
&s;hining Gold, Silver, Embroidery, and great lighted Candles
which adorn the Altar, it &s;eems as if the Rays of the Sun play'd
before your Eyes. There are al&s;o &s;ome Cages painted and gilt,
and filled with Nightingales, Canary Birds and others, which
make a charming noi&s;e. I &s;hould be very glad that in <HI>France</HI>
they would imitate them in adorning our Churches. The Walls
of this Church is all over covered on the out&s;ide with the Chains
and Irons of the Captives which have been redeemed out of <HI>Bar|bary.</HI>
In this part of the Town I ob&s;erved that mo&s;t of the
Hou&s;es had upon their Doors a &s;quare piece of Earthen Ware,
upon which was &s;et the Angelical Salutation in the&s;e words,
<HI>Maria &s;ue concebida &s;in peca lo original.</HI> I was told that the&s;e
Hou&s;es belonged to the Arch-bi&s;hop, and that none but tho&s;e
that work in Silk dwell in them, of which there are very many
at <HI>Tolleda.</HI> The two &s;tone Bridges cro&s;s the River are very high,
broad and long. If they would but take a little pains with the
<HI>Tagus,</HI> Boats might come up to the City, this would be a con|&s;iderable
Conveniency; but they are naturally too lazy, to con|&s;ider
that the Profit and Advantage of a work is to be prefer'd
<PB N="255" REF="264">
before the trouble of undertaking it. We al&s;o &s;aw the Ho&s;pital
of <HI>Los Linnos,</HI> that is of Foundlings, and the City-Hou&s;e which
is near the Cathedral; and at la&s;t our Curio&s;ity being &s;atisfied,
we came back to the Archiepi&s;copal Palace, and we went to
Bed and laid till Night, when again we had another Fea&s;t as
&s;plendid as the former. His Eminence eat with us, and when
we had returned him all due thanks, we &s;et forward towards the
Ca&s;tle of <HI>Ignarica:</HI> The Marque&s;s <HI>de Palacios,</HI> with all his Fa|mily,
was there waiting for us; &s;o that we were &s;o obligingly
received, that nothing can be added to the good Chear and to
the Plea&s;ure, with which we were entertained for &s;ix days, ei|ther
in Fi&s;hing upon the River <HI>Xarama,</HI> or in Hunting, in Walk|ing,
or in common Conver&s;ation: Every one was Emulous to
appear good humoured, and one may &s;ay, that when the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
go &s;o far as to lay a&s;ide their Gravity, and know and love
you, they contribute hugely to ea&s;e and recreate the Mind. They
become &s;ociable, obliging, earne&s;t to plea&s;e you, and the be&s;t
Company in the World. This is what I have found in this little
Journey I have made, of which I &s;hould not have given you &s;o
particular an Account; but yet I am per&s;waded, Dear Co&s;en,
you de&s;ire it &s;o, and that you &s;et &s;ome value upon my Complai|&s;ance.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Ceremony of Swearing to the Treaty of Peace con|cluded
at <HI>Nimmiguen,</HI> between the Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and
<HI>Spain,</HI> was performed here the la&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> I had a great
de&s;ire to have &s;een what pa&s;t then; but as Women are not to
be pre&s;ent there, &s;o the <HI>Conne&s;table De Ca&s;tille</HI> promi&s;ed to get
us into the <HI>King's</HI> Chamber, as &s;oon as he &s;hould be gone into
the great Hall, Madam <HI>Gueux</HI> the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors Lady,
and Madam <HI>De Chais,</HI> the Envoy of <HI>Hollands</HI> Lady, were there
al&s;o. We went up at a private Pair of Stairs, where one of the
<HI>Con&s;table's</HI> Gentlemen waited to receive us, and we tarried for
&s;ome time in a very fine Clo&s;et full of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Books well bound
and very diverting: There are among&s;t others, I found the Hi&s;to|ry
of <HI>Don Quixot,</HI> the famous <HI>Knight of the Manca,</HI> in which
<PB N="256" REF="265">
the plainne&s;s and the &s;ubtilty of the Expre&s;&s;ion, the weigh
and &s;trength of Proverbs, and that which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call
<HI>El pico,</HI> that is the &s;martne&s;s and nicety of a Language, appeared
quite otherwi&s;e, then the Tran&s;lations which we have in <HI>French.</HI>
I was &s;o plea&s;ed in reading it, that I hardly thought of &s;ee|ing
the Ceremony. It began as &s;oon as the Marque&s;s <HI>De Villars</HI>
came, and through a Lattice-window which was opened, we
&s;aw what pa&s;t. The <HI>King</HI> placed him&s;elf at the end of the
great Guilt-Hall, which is one of the mo&s;t &s;tately in the Palace.
The <HI>Alcove</HI> was &s;pread with a wonderful fine Carpet; the
Throne and the Canopy were embroidered with Pearls, Dia|monds,
Rubies, Emeraulds and other precious Stones.
Cardinal <HI>Portocarrero</HI> &s;at in a great Chair below the <HI>Alcove,</HI> on
the right hand of the Throne; the Con&s;table of <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> &s;at up|on
a Stool; the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador was &s;eated on the left
hand of the Throne upon a Bench covered with Velvet, and the
<HI>Grandees</HI> were placed near the Cardinal; when every body was
&s;eated according to their Quality, the <HI>King</HI> came in, and
when he was in the Throne, the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> the <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> and
the <HI>Grandees</HI> &s;et down and covered them&s;elves. A Secretary
read aloud, the Power which the mo&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> King had
&s;ent to his Amba&s;&s;ador. After that, a little Table was brought
and &s;et before the <HI>King,</HI> with a Crucifix and a Book of the <HI>E|vangeli&s;ts,</HI>
and whil&s;t he held his hand upon it the <HI>Cardinal</HI>
read the Oath, by which he &s;wore to keep the Peace with
<HI>France:</HI> There are &s;ome other little Ceremonies, but I did not
mind them well enough to be able to give you an Account of
them. A little after the <HI>King</HI> returned to his Lodgings, but
we were gone out of them before: We &s;tayed in the &s;ame Clo|&s;et
where we &s;topt at fir&s;t: It was &s;o near his Chamber, that
we heard him &s;ay, that he was never &s;o hot, and that he would
put off his Collar: And indeed, the Sun does &s;hine very hot in
this Country. At my fir&s;t coming hither, I was afflicted with a
&s;trange Meagrim, and could not imagine the cau&s;e of it, but
my Kin&s;woman told me 'twas becau&s;e I wore too much upon my
Head, and that if I did not take care I might loo&s;e my &s;ight &s;o,
I immediately threw off my Bonnets and my Cornets, and &s;ince
that time I have never had any pain in my Head. For my
part, I cannot believe that there is in any part of the World
more &s;erene Air than there's here: It is &s;o pure, that you can|not
perceive &s;o much as one Cloud; and it is affirmed to me,
that even the Weather here in Winter, is like the fine&s;t Wea|ther
in any other Country? That which is mo&s;t dangerous here
is a certain Wind <HI>De Galiegue,</HI> which blows off the Mountains of
<PB N="257" REF="266">
<HI>Gallicia:</HI> It is not violent, but 'tis &s;o piercing, that it reaches
the very Bones, and &s;ometimes cau&s;es a Lamene&s;s in a Leg or
an Arm, and often in half the Body, which la&s;ts for ones life:
It is more frequent in Summer than in Winter. Strangers
take it for the We&s;tern Briezes, and are ravi&s;ht when they
feel it, but experience convinces them of its Malignity. The
Sea&s;ons in <HI>Spain</HI> are much more convenient and plea&s;ant than
either in <HI>France, England, Holland,</HI> or <HI>Germany.</HI> For not to rec|kon
that purity of Air, which cannot be imagined &s;o fine as 'tis
from the Month of <HI>September</HI> to the Month of <HI>June,</HI> 'tis not &s;o
cold, but one can make a &s;hift without fire; and this is the
rea&s;on why there's no Chimneys in any of their Apartments,
and that they make u&s;e only of Chafindi&s;hes. But 'tis a great
Happine&s;s that Wood being &s;o &s;carce as 'tis in this Country,
they have no occa&s;ion for't; It never freezes thicker than the
thickne&s;s of two Crowns, and there falls little Snow. But the
adjacent Mountains furni&s;h <HI>Madrid</HI> with it all the Year round.
The Months of <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> are indeed exce&s;&s;ive hot.</P>
<P>I was lately in a Company where all the Ladies were &s;adly
frighted: One of them &s;aid, that &s;he had received a Letter from
<HI>Barcelona,</HI> which advi&s;ed, that a Bell there, which was only
rung upon &s;ome publick Calamity, or upon &s;ome occa&s;ion of
the highe&s;t Con&s;equence, had all alone rung &s;everal times:
This Lady came from <HI>Barcelona,</HI> and &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, that when|ever
any Misfortune and Mi&s;ery is to befal <HI>Spain,</HI> or that any of
the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> is to die, this Bell rings; that for a quar|ter
of an Hour together, the Clapper of the Bell moves with a
&s;trange quickne&s;s, and &s;trikes in turning round: I would not
believe it, neither do I yet: But all the Company confirmed
what &s;he &s;aid: If it is a Lye, there were above twenty that con|&s;pired
with her in it. They began to think upon what, and on
whom this unhappine&s;s which by this &s;ign is foretold was to
fall; and as they are very Super&s;titious, the beautiful Marchio|ne&s;s
<HI>De Liche,</HI> increa&s;t their fears, by telling them, that <HI>Don
John</HI> was very &s;ick.</P>
<P>In their deep Mourning, they are attired like Fools, but chief|ly
on the fir&s;t days; for the Foot-men as well as the Ma&s;ters
have long Cloaks trailing, and in&s;tead of Hats, they wear a
high Pa&s;t-board Cap covered with Crape, their Hor&s;es are all in
black Trappings, and Hou&s;&s;ings which cover their Heads and all
their Bodies. Nothing looks uglier, their Coaches are &s;o ill co|vered
that the Cloth which covers the Roof hangs almo&s;t down
to the Boots. No body that &s;ees this doleful Equipage but
would think, that &s;ome Corps is a carrying to be buryed; the
<PB N="258" REF="267">
People of Quality wear their Cloaks of black Bays, very thin
and rotten, the lea&s;t thing tears it in pieces: And that Mourn|ing
is mo&s;t graceful, that is mo&s;t ragged and tattered. I have
&s;een &s;ome <HI>Cavalleros</HI> which tore their Cloaths on purpo&s;e, and
I a&s;&s;ure you, that through &s;ome of their Cloaths, you may &s;ee
their Skin as ugly as 'tis to look on: For though their Children
when they are young, are as white as Alaba&s;ter, and &s;o pret|ty,
that you would take them for Angels, yet it mu&s;t be grant|ed,
that as they grow bigger, they alter very &s;trangely, the
heat of the Sun roa&s;t them, the Air tans them, and it is ea&s;ie
to know a <HI>Spaniard</HI> from any other Nation: Their Features are
neverthele&s;s regular, but &s;till there wants methinks our Air and
Meen as well as our Skin and Complexion.</P>
<P>All the Scholars wear long Robes, with a little Border of
Linnen about their Necks in&s;tead of a Collar; they are habited
very like the Je&s;uits; there's of them above thirty Years old,
they are known to be Students by their Habits.</P>
<P>I fancy this City to look like a great Coup, in which they
feed Poultry: For really from the Level of the Street to the
fourth Story, one can &s;ee nothing but Lattices who&s;e holes are
very &s;mall, and their very Balconies have them. There's always
to be &s;een &s;ome of the poor confined Women &s;tanding behind
them, to look upon Pa&s;&s;engers, and when they dare, they open
them, and with great delight &s;new them&s;elves; there's not a
Night pa&s;&s;es without four or five hundred Con&s;orts of Mu&s;ick,
in &s;everal parts of the Town, it's true they are at a moderate
rate, and it is &s;ufficient if a Gallant has only his Guittar or his
Harp, and &s;ometimes both joyn'd with a Voice hoar&s;e enough
to awake the mo&s;t drow&s;ie body, and affords them the plea&s;ure
of a Queen. If either they do not under&s;tand what is mo&s;t ex|cellent,
or cannot obtain it, they are content with what they
can get: I never &s;aw any Virginals or Theorba's here.</P>
<P>In every Street, and at every corner Hou&s;e, there's an Image
or Statue of our Lady dre&s;s'd after the Fa&s;hion of the Country,
with a Pair of Beads in her Hands, and either a great Wax
Candle or a Lamp burning before her: I have &s;een three or four
in my Kin&s;woman's Stable, with other pieces of Devotion, for
you mu&s;t know, that every Groom will have his Oratory as well
as his Ma&s;ter, though perhaps neither one nor t'other often
pray there. When one Lady goes to vi&s;it another, if it be in
the Night, four Pages comes to receive her with great Flam|boys
of white Wax, and in the &s;ame manner conduct her out
again, and while &s;he's going into her Chair, they commonly
kneel upon one Knee: This is &s;omething more &s;plendid, than
<PB N="259" REF="268">
the &s;mall Wax Candles enclo&s;ed in Links which are u&s;ed in
<HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Here are Hou&s;es on purpo&s;e for Women of lewd Lives, like
the <HI>Madelennottes</HI> at <HI>Paris:</HI> They u&s;e them very &s;everely, and
there is not a day pa&s;&s;es that they are not whipt &s;everal times;
in a certain time they are relea&s;ed, but come out wor&s;e than
they went in, what they &s;uffered making them not a bit the
better. They live almo&s;t altogether in a particular part of the
Town, where vertuous Women never go, but if by chance any
one does go that way, they run and pur&s;ue after her, as if &s;he
was their Enemy, and if it happens that they are the &s;tronge&s;t,
&s;he is &s;ure to be cruelly u&s;ed, and for the <HI>Cavalleros</HI> they run
the Ri&s;que of being torn in pieces as oft as they pa&s;s that way,
that is to &s;ay, who &s;hall have 'em. One takes him by the Arm, ano|ther
by the Legs and a third by the Head, and if he grows angry,
they altogether fall upon him and rob him, and even &s;trip him of
his Cloaths. My Kin&s;woman has a Page who was ignorant of the
Tricks of the wretched Wenches, and went innocently through
their Quarters, but they &s;tript him as naked as common Thieves
in a Wood could have done; and yet a Man mu&s;t be content
with this Treatment, for to whom &s;hall he go for Re&s;titution?</P>
<P>The Bell of <HI>Barcelona</HI> hath been but too true in its Progno|&s;ticks,
for <HI>Don John</HI> was the fir&s;t of this Month brought down &s;o
very low with his &s;ickne&s;s, that the Phy&s;icians de&s;paired of him,
and he was advi&s;ed to prepare him&s;elf for Death: He received the
News with &s;o much Tranquility and Re&s;ignation, as very much
confirmed the Belief that &s;everal Per&s;ons that before entertained,
that he had taken &s;ome private di&s;gu&s;t, which made him rather
wi&s;h to die than live: The King came every moment into his
Chamber, and &s;pent &s;everal hours at his Bed-&s;ide, notwith&s;tand|ing
his earne&s;t Prayers that he would not &s;o expo&s;e him&s;elf to a
Feaver: He received the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Viaticum,</HI> made his Will, and
writ a Letter to a Lady who&s;e name I could not learn: He com|manded
<HI>Don Antonio Ortis</HI> his chief Secretary to carry it with a
little Box lockt, which I &s;aw; it was made of <HI>China</HI> Wood, and
light enough to make one think there was in't nothing but Let|ters
and perhaps &s;ome Jewels, while he was &s;o dangerou&s;ly &s;ick,
a Courrier arrived with the News of the King's Marriage with
<HI>Mademoi&s;elle,</HI> the Joy of which did not only fill the Palace, but
all the City &s;hewed Expre&s;&s;ions of it, for there were over the
whole Town Artificial Fire-works and Illuminations for three
Days together. The King could not contain him&s;elf, but run
into <HI>Don John's</HI> Chamber, and although he was very drou&s;y and
heavy to &s;leep, and wanted re&s;t, yet he awaked him to tell him
<PB N="260" REF="269">
that the Queen would quickly be here, and intreated him to
think of nothing but being well again, that he might a&s;&s;i&s;t at her
reception. Ah <HI>Syre,</HI> an&s;wered the Prince to him, <HI>I &s;hall never
have that Satisfacti$n, I &s;hould be content to die, if I had had the
Honour to have &s;een her once:</HI> The King fell a weeping, and told
him, <HI>That &s;eeing him in that Condition, was the only thing that di|&s;turbed
his Happine&s;s.</HI> There was to have been a Bull-Fea&s;t, but
the Prince's &s;ickne&s;s has cau&s;ed it to be put off, and the King
would not have &s;uffered any Fire-works in the Palace-Court,
had not <HI>Don John,</HI> notwith&s;tanding he had a violent pain in his
Head begged him to permit them. In fine, the 17<HI>th</HI> of this
Month he dyed, extreamly regretted by &s;ome, and as little by o|thers.
This is the fate both of Princes and Favourites, as well
as of Per&s;ons that move in an ordinary Sphere; and as his Cre|dit
was already declining, and the Courtiers now thought of no|thing
el&s;e but the Queen-Mothers return, and the Arrival of the
new Queen, &s;o it is a mighty &s;trange thing to ob&s;erve with what
indifference the &s;ickne&s;s and Death of <HI>Don John</HI> was taken, they
did not &s;o much as talk of him the very next day, it &s;eemed as
if he had never been in the World. Alas, Dear Co&s;en, does
not this de&s;erve a little to be reflected on? He governed all the
Kingdoms of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> his very name &s;truck Terror, he
cau&s;ed the Queen-Mother to be bani&s;ht, he drove away Father
<HI>Nitard</HI> and <HI>Valenuela,</HI> who were both Favourites, he had for
the mo&s;t part a greater Court than the King: And yet four and
twenty hours after he was dead, I believe <HI>I</HI> &s;aw in different pla|ces
fifty Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Quality, which did not &s;o much
as &s;peak one word of this poor Prince, notwith&s;tanding divers
of them had very great Obligations to him: And yet after all,
he had very great per&s;onal Qualifications and Virtues: He was
of a middle Stature, and a well &s;haped body, his Features were
regular, his Eyes black and lively, he had black Hair, a great
deal of it and very long: He was well bred, of a great Wit and
Judgment, very generous, brave and beneficent, and had a Ca|pacity
for the highe&s;t Affairs. He was not ignorant of any thing
that was &s;uitable to his Birth, nor of any of the Arts and Sci|ences.
He both &s;poke and writ very well five &s;everal Languages,
and under&s;tood more: He was perfectly well read in Hi&s;tory, he
could both make and play upon any In&s;trument as well as the
be&s;t Ma&s;ter. He under&s;tood how to turn &s;everal things; he
could forge Arms, and he much delighted in the Mathematicks,
but being called to the management of the Government, he was
obliged to take his thoughts off of all the&s;e Exerci&s;es. The face
of things changed in a moment, his Eyes were &s;carce clo&s;ed,
<PB N="261" REF="270">
before the King (moved only by his own kind and ea&s;ie Nature
for the Queen his Mother) run to <HI>Tolleda</HI> to &s;ee her, and to in|treat
her to return, &s;he con&s;ented to it with all the Joy &s;he had
to &s;ee the King. They wept not a little, while they embraced
each other, and we &s;aw them come back together. All the Per|&s;ons
of Quality went to meet their Maje&s;ties, and the People
&s;hewed abundance of Joy. I &s;hould enlarge a great deal more
upon this return, did I not intend to be very particular in the
Memoirs I am writing.</P>
<P><HI>Don John</HI> laid three days in his Bed of State, and in the &s;ame
Cloaths which he had made to go meet the young Queen, after
that he was carried to the <HI>E&s;curial:</HI> The Funeral had nothing
of Greatne&s;s, the Officers of his Hou&s;e, with a very few Friends
accompanyed him: He was laid in the little Vault near the <HI>Pan|theon,</HI>
which is re&s;erved &s;olely for the Princes and Prince&s;&s;es of
the Royal Blood, for there are none bu$yed in the <HI>Pantheon,</HI> you
mu&s;t know, but Kings, and tho&s;e Queens that have had Chil|dren,
tho&s;e that have had none, are buryed in that particular
Vault. In a few days we are to go to the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> which will
be when the King goes there; but he is &s;o taken up with his
young Queen, that he can think of nothing but going towards
the Frontiers to meet her. In every place where I come, they
are continually ringing it aloud in my Ears, that &s;he'll quickly
be Queen of two and twenty Kingdoms. In all likelihood there's
eleven of them in the <HI>Indies;</HI> for I only know tho&s;e of the old
and new <HI>Ca&s;tille, Arragon, Valentia, Navarre, Murcia, Grenada,
Andalou&s;ia, Gallicia, Leon,</HI> and the I&s;les <HI>Majorques.</HI> In the&s;e
Places there are &s;ome parts of them admirable, upon which it
&s;eems as if Heaven had a mind to &s;pread abroad its mo&s;t benign
Influences. There are others again &s;o barren, that there is nei|ther
Corn, Herbs, Vines, Fruit, Meadows, nor Springs, and of
the&s;e one may &s;ay, there's more than of the others. But gene|rally
&s;peaking, the Air there is good and whol&s;ome. In certain
parts the Heats are exce&s;&s;ive, and in others the Cold and the
Winds are in&s;upportable, although 'tis in the &s;ame Sea&s;on. There
are a great many Rivers, but that which is pretty &s;ingular, is,
that the bigge&s;t of them is not Navigable, particularly tho&s;e of
<HI>Tagus, Gurdiana, Minchio, Duero, Guadalguiver,</HI> and that of <HI>E|bre;</HI>
for either becau&s;e of the Rocks, the falls of Water, the
Gulphes, or the Turnings, Ve&s;&s;els cannot pa&s;s upon them, and
this is one of the greate&s;t Difficulties of Trade, and which mo&s;t
of all hinders tho&s;e things from coming to Cities which there's
need of; for if there was an ea&s;ie Communication between
them, tho&s;e Places and Towns that want a great many Wares
<PB N="262" REF="271">
and Good, might be &s;upplyed from tho&s;e that abound, and &s;o
every body might be furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;ary things at a rea&s;o|nable
price; whereas the Charges by Land-carriage being &s;o
high one mu&s;t want divers Conveniencies, unle&s;s you are in a
Condition to pay three times more for a thing than 'tis worth.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the &s;everal Cities which belong to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>
the&s;e are e&s;teemed, either for Beauty or Riches, <HI>viz. Madrid,
Sevelle, Grenada, Valentia, Sarragou&s;a, Tolleda, Vailladolid, Cor|doua,
Salamancha, Cadiz, Naples, Milan, Me&s;&s;ina, Palermo, Cag|liari,
Bruxelles, Antwerp, Gant,</HI> and <HI>Mons.</HI> There are a great
many others, which neverthele&s;s are very con&s;iderable; and
&s;everal of the Towns are as big as Cities; but there are not in
them tho&s;e multitudes of People, which are both the Riches and
Strength of a King. And there are divers Rea&s;ons to be given
why there is this defect. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> When King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> drove a|way
the <HI>Moors</HI> out of <HI>Spain,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;hed the Inqui&s;ition,
what through the Puni&s;hments they inflicted upon &s;ome <HI>Jews,</HI>
and the bani&s;hing of others, there dyed and went out of the
Kingdom in a little while, above nine hundred thou&s;and Per&s;ons,
be&s;ides, the <HI>Indies</HI> draw away abundance; the Unfortunate go
there to enrich them&s;elves, and when they have done &s;o, they
remain to enjoy the fruit of their Labour, and the Plea&s;ures of
the Country. Again Soldiers are rai&s;ed in <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;ent away
to Gari&s;on other Cities under the obedience of the King, the&s;e
Soldiers marry and &s;ettle in the Places where they happen to be,
and never return to tho&s;e from whence they came. Add to this,
that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women bear but few Children; if they have
three 'tis reckoned abundance, and Strangers do not come to in|habit
there, as in other parts of the World, becau&s;e they are not
loved there, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are naturally <HI>recatados,</HI> that is &s;in|gular,
and re&s;erved to them&s;elves, and will not be communicative
and open with other Nations, which they either envy or &s;corn.
And thus having examined into all tho&s;e means which help to
depopulate the Country under his Catholick Maje&s;ty, one may
rather wonder that there are &s;o many People remaining.</P>
<P>There grows but little Corn in <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> it is brought from <HI>Si|cily,
France</HI> and <HI>Flanders;</HI> and indeed, how &s;hould it grow, un|le&s;s
the Earth would produce it of it &s;elf, as the Land of <HI>Pro|mi&s;e</HI>
did? The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are too idle to take the pains to Till and
improve it, for being the meane&s;t Pea&s;ant is per&s;waded that he
is <HI>Hidalgo,</HI> that is to &s;ay, a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> that in every little Fami|ly
there's an Apocryphal Hi&s;tory, compo&s;ed within an hundred
Years, which he leaves to his Children and Nephews of a Vil|lage
as an Inheritance, in which fabulous Hi&s;tory they are all
<PB N="263" REF="272">
made to de&s;cend from ancient <HI>Chivalry,</HI> who&s;e Ance&s;tors have
done wonderful things; reciting that their Great Grandfather,
<HI>Don Pedro,</HI> and <HI>Don John,</HI> performed &s;uch and &s;uch Services to
the Crown. I &s;ay, they having taking up the&s;e vain Conceits of
them&s;elves, no wonder if they will neither derogate from the
<HI>Gravidad,</HI> nor <HI>Decendentia.</HI> At this rate do they talk, and they
will more willingly endure Hunger, and all Severities of Life,
than work (&s;ay they) like Mercinaries, which belongs only to
Slaves. And thus Pride &s;econded by Sloth, hinder the mo&s;t
part of them to &s;ow their Land, unle&s;s &s;ome Strangers come
and help them to till their Ground, which by a &s;pecial directi|on
and guidance of Providence always happens. Strangers that
are more laborious and wordly minded, being moved thither
by the gain they find; &s;o that you &s;hall have a &s;orry Pea&s;ant
&s;itting in his Chair reading of a mouldy <HI>Romance,</HI> whil&s;t the&s;e
Strangers are working for him, in order to carry away his
Money.</P>
<P>There's no Oats to be &s;een, Hay is &s;carce, their Hor&s;es and
Mules eat Barley in the Straw chopt &s;mall. The Hills and
Mountains in the&s;e Kingdoms I &s;peak of, are of &s;uch a prodi|gious
heighth and length, that I do not believe there's the like
in any other part of the World, one meets with &s;ome of an hun|dred
Leagues in length, which joyn one to another in a con|tinued
Chain, and which without Hyperbole, are higher than
the Clouds, they are called <HI>Sierras,</HI> among&s;t which are reckoned
the Mountains of <HI>Pyrenea, Granada, A&s;tura, Alcantara, Morena, Tol|leda,
Doua, Molina</HI> and <HI>Albanera.</HI> The&s;e Hills render the way
&s;o very difficult, that no Waggons can pa&s;s, which obliges
them to carry all upon Mules, who are &s;o &s;ure footed, that in
two hundred Leagues continual travelling among&s;t Rocks, and
great Flint Stones, they will not &s;o much as once &s;tumble.</P>

<P>They do not trouble their Heads to &s;tudy much here, that
little they do know bears them out, for with the help of their
Wit and Grave looks, they &s;eldom betray their ignorance by
being at a lo&s;s about any matters; when they &s;peak, they
always &s;eem to know more than they do; and when they are
&s;ilent, you would think them wi&s;e enough to re&s;olve the mo&s;t
knotty Que&s;tions. Neverthele&s;s there are &s;ome famous Uni|ver&s;ities
in <HI>Spain,</HI> among&s;t which they reckon, <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a, Bar|celona,
Salamanca, Alcala, Santiago, Grenada, Seville, Coim|bra,
Terragona, Evora, Lisben, Madrid, Marcia, Majorque, Tol|leda,
Lerida, Valantia</HI> and <HI>Occa:</HI> There are but few famous
Preachers; here and there you'll meet with &s;ome that are Pa|thetical:
But indeed, let the&s;e Sermons be good or bad, the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> that hear them will perpetually beat their brea&s;ts with
an Extraordinary fervour, and even di&s;turb the Preacher with
the grievous Cry which their troubled Con&s;ciences make them
utter. I am willing to believe that there are a few that have
&s;ome compunction, but in my Con&s;cience, I doubt far le&s;s than
they make &s;hew of: They never leave off their <HI>Swords,</HI> either
when they go to Confe&s;&s;ion or the Sacrament; they &s;ay,
they wear them to defend <HI>Religion;</HI> and in the Morning before
they put them on, they ki&s;s them and make the &s;ign of the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI>
with them; they pay an exce&s;&s;ive Devotion to the Ble&s;&s;ed
<HI>Virgin,</HI> and put an extraordinary confidence in her; there's
hardly any Man that does not wear a <HI>Scapular</HI> or &s;ome em|broidered
<HI>Image</HI> that hath toucht &s;ome of tho&s;e that are held to
be <HI>miraculous;</HI> and tho' otherwi&s;e they do not lead lives very
regular, yet they will not forbear praying to <HI>her</HI> with a tru&s;t,
that 'tis <HI>&s;he</HI> that mu&s;t protect and &s;ave them from the greate&s;t
Evils; they are very charitable, not only upon the account of
the Merits by Alms Deeds, but al&s;o by a natural Inclination
they have to give, and a real pain they endure if either through
Poverty, or for any other rea&s;on they are forced to refu&s;e any
thing that is askt them; they have al&s;o another good Quality,
which is never to for&s;ake their Friend in Sickne&s;s, their care
and their concern is far greater in &s;uch a time, when doubtle&s;s
the Pre&s;ence as well as the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Friend is mo&s;t want|ed.
So that Per&s;ons that do not &s;ee one another four times in
a Year, yet are con&s;tant in their Vi&s;its three or four times every
day; when one is under any affliction, and that they can
become u&s;eful to each other: But as &s;oon as they are well,
they re&s;ume the &s;ame way of living they u&s;ed before they
were &s;ick.</P>

<HI>Don Frederick de Cardonna,</HI> of whom I now talk to you,
Dear Cou&s;en, as if he and you were well acquainted, is returned,
He hath brought me a Letter from the fair Marchione&s;s <HI>De los
Rios,</HI> who without doubt is &s;till one of the prettie&s;t Women
in the World, and who is not weary of her retirement. I al&s;o
by him heard from the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Burgos,</HI> who&s;e Merits are
uncommon; and he added, that he came back in the company
of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentleman, who had told him &s;ome very wonder|ful
things; among&s;t others, that every <HI>Spaniard</HI> who is born on
<HI>Good-Friday,</HI> whenever they go by or through any Church yard,
in which there has been any body buryed that was murdered,
or if they pa&s;s through any place where a Murder has been
committed, altho' the Man who was kill'd has been taken away,
yet for all that he appears to them all bloody, and in the &s;ame
manner and condition he happened to be in when he was
murdered, and this too, whether they knew one another or no:
This certainly is a very unplea&s;ant thing to tho&s;e it happens,
but in requital they can cure the Plague with breathing upon
the Party, and do not receive the Infection, altho' they be with
tho&s;e that have the Plague upon them: Many People, &s;aid he,
wondred that <HI>Philip</HI> the IV. held his head &s;o high, and &s;taired
up with his eyes, the rea&s;on was, he was born on <HI>Good Friday,</HI>
and when he was very young he had &s;everal Apparitions of
the&s;e Per&s;ons that had been murdered; &s;o that with the
fright of them, he had got a cu&s;tom (very &s;eldom) to hold down
his head: But, &s;aid I to <HI>Don Frederic,</HI> did he talk &s;eriou&s;ly, and
as if the&s;e things were allowed of every body without any doubt.
And ju&s;t as I was &s;aying, that it would be worth while to en|quire
of &s;ome creditable Per&s;on about the&s;e Matters; <HI>Don Fer|dinand
de Tolleda</HI> came into my Chamber, and &s;o he askt him,
and he a&s;&s;ured me that he had very frequently heard folks talk
thus of the&s;e Matters, but yet he would not an&s;wer for the
Truth. It is al&s;o &s;aid, continued he, that there are a certain
People which can kill a mad Dog with breathing upon him,
and that they have a Power to remain in the Fire without be|ing
burnt; and yet I could never &s;ee any of them that cared to
tru&s;t them&s;elves there, but they give this rea&s;on, that tho' they
could &s;afely do it, yet there would be &s;omething of Vanity in
it by &s;uch peculiar Favours from Heaven to di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves
from other Men; and for my part, &s;aid I laughing, I am
of Opinion the&s;e Men have more Prudence than Humility:
They are afraid (as 'tis but rea&s;onable) of the biting of the Dog,
and the Heat of the Furnace. I am altogether of your mind,

there's a Spring who&s;e Water freezes as it drops, and grows
&s;o hard, that it becomes a perfect Stone, which cannot ea&s;ily

Hou&s;es? You have a good Stock of Examples, &s;aid <HI>Don Frede|rick,</HI>

<HI>Arragon;</HI> If the &s;heep feed upon't before the &s;un ri&s;e they die,
but if they are &s;ick, and feed there after the Sun is up they are

a certain Plant which withers upon the fir&s;t appearance of the

who returned out of the City, where &s;he had &s;pent &s;ome part
of the day at her Lawyers, who was at the point of Death, he is
very old, and a very knowing Man in his Profe&s;&s;ion: She told
us, that all his Children &s;tood round his Bed, and that the only
thing which he recommended to them, was always to pre&s;erve a
<PB N="267" REF="276">
good &s;tock of <HI>Gravity;</HI> and after he had ble&s;t them, &s;ays he to
'em, what greater good can I now wi&s;h you, my dear Children,
than to lead your whole Lives at <HI>Madrid,</HI> and never to quit this
<HI>Earthly Paradice,</HI> but for the <HI>Heavenly:</HI> This may &s;hew con|tinued
&s;he, the &s;trange Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have for
<HI>Madrid,</HI> and the Happine&s;s they enjoy in that Court: For my
part &s;aid I, in interrupting her, I am per&s;waded there's a|bundance
of Vanity in that fondne&s;s that they expre&s;s for their
own Nation, for certainly they have too much Sen&s;e not to know
that there are many other Countries far more agreeable. Is it
not true, &s;aid I, in addre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf to <HI>Don Fernand,</HI> that
tho' you will not &s;ay as I &s;ay, that you have the &s;ame thoughts?
what my thoughts are, &s;aid he in &s;miling, is no rule for other
folks; I mu&s;t tell you, that &s;ince my return, I am upbraided by
every body with being no longer a <HI>Spaniard:</HI> But certain it is,
that People being &s;o bewitcht with the Delights and Charms
of <HI>Madrid,</HI> and not having power to for&s;ake it in any &s;ea&s;on of
the Year, no body has thoughts of Building pretty Hou&s;es in the
Country whither they might &s;ometimes retire; &s;o that all adja|cent
parts about the City, which &s;hould be filled with delicious
Gardens and &s;plendid Seatslook like &s;o many little De&s;erts, and this
is the rea&s;on al&s;o, why the City in Summer as well as in Win|ter,
is equally crowded with People: Hereupon my Kin&s;woman
&s;aid, &s;he would have me to the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> and that it was agreed
on by the Marchione&s;s of <HI>Palacios</HI> and <HI>La Ro&s;a,</HI> to go two
days hence; the Lady your Mother, added &s;he, in &s;peaking to
<HI>Don Fernand,</HI> de&s;igns you to make one, and I indeed to &s;ecure
<HI>Don Frederick</HI> for another, they both declared, that with abun|dance
of Joy, they would go this little Journey; and indeed,
the next day we went to ki&s;s <HI>Queen-Mothers</HI> hand, and to know
her commands for the <HI>E&s;curial:</HI> For you mu&s;t know, 'tis the
Cu&s;tom, when one is to go out of <HI>Madrid,</HI> fir&s;t to pay their re|&s;pects
to the <HI>Queen.</HI> But we had not &s;een her &s;ince her return,
&s;he looks merrier than &s;he did at <HI>Tolleda,</HI> and told us, &s;he did
not think of coming back &s;o &s;oon to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and that now it
&s;eemed, as if &s;he had never been out of it. There was brought
before her a <HI>Gyant-Woman</HI> that came from the <HI>Indies:</HI> As &s;oon
as &s;he &s;aw her, &s;he cau&s;ed her to be taken away, &s;he was &s;o af|frighted
at her. Her Ladies would make this <HI>Colo&s;&s;us</HI> dance,
who held in each hand two <HI>She Dwarfs</HI> that played upon the
Ca&s;tinets and the <HI>Bi&s;cay</HI> Drum, all this was ugly in the highe&s;t
degree. My Kin&s;woman ob&s;erved in the <HI>Queen Mothers</HI> Apartment,
things which had been <HI>Don John's,</HI> among&s;t others an admira|ble
Pendulum Clock, all &s;et with Diamonds, he made her in
<PB N="268" REF="277">
part, his Heir, in all likelihood 'twas to te&s;tifie his regret for
having troubled and vexed her.</P>
<P>The Journey to the <HI>E&s;curial</HI> was performed with all imagina|ble
Satisfaction, the de&s;ire of entertaining you with it, hindred
me from &s;ending you the Letter I begun before I went thither,
the &s;ame Ladies that went to <HI>Arranjus</HI> and <HI>Tolleda,</HI> were very
glad to embrace the occa&s;ion of taking the Air a little in &s;o fine
a Sea&s;on, and we went fir&s;t to the <HI>Prado,</HI> which is a Royal Hou&s;e,
the Building like the re&s;t in <HI>Spain</HI> is hand&s;ome enough, that is, it
con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;quare of four &s;everal Apartments &s;eparted by Gal|leries
of Communication, which are &s;upported with Pillars, the
Furniture of it, is not indeed &s;tately, but there are good Pictures,
among&s;t others, tho&s;e of the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> in odd &s;orts of
Dre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>We were &s;hewed a little Clo&s;et, which the late King u&s;ed to
call his beloved, becau&s;e in it he was wont &s;ometimes to enter|tain
him&s;elf with his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, this Prince who was &s;eemingly
&s;o cold and grave, that he was hardly ever &s;een to laugh, was
really the mo&s;t amorous and the plea&s;ante&s;t of Men. There is
a Garden well enough kept, and a Park of a con&s;iderable extent,
whether the King frequently goes to hunt, we were afterwards
at a Convent of the <HI>Capuchins,</HI> which &s;tands on the top of a
Hill, this is a Place of great Devotion, becau&s;e of a Crucifix
which it &s;eems was taken from the true Cro&s;s, and which often
works Miracles: After we had &s;aid our Prayers there, we de|&s;cended
on the other &s;ide of the Hill, to a certain Hermitage
where there was a Reclu&s;e, that would neither &s;ee us, nor &s;peak
to us, but he threw a Ticket to us through his Grate, in which
we found it writ, that he would recommend us to God. We
were all extream weary, for we were forced to walk a foot up
the Hill, and it was very hot Weather, we perceived in the
bottom of the Hill a very little Cottage by the &s;ide of a Brook,
which runs among&s;t Willow Trees, we &s;teered our Cour&s;e that
way, and when we were yet a great way off, we could &s;ee a Man
and a Woman very well dre&s;t, ri&s;e up nimbly from the foot of
a Tree where they were &s;et, and run into that Cottage, and &s;hut
the Door as ha&s;tily as if they had taken us for thieves, but
doubtle&s;s it was fear of being known, which made them avoid us,
we went to the Place they had left, being &s;et on the Gra&s;s, we
fell to eating &s;ome Fruit we brought with us, we were &s;o nigh
this little Hou&s;e, that they could ea&s;ily &s;ee through their Win|dows
what we were doing; there came out a very pretty Coun|try
La&s;s, and with a Sea-Ru&s;h Basket addre&s;t her &s;elf to us, and
kneeling, begged &s;ome of the Fruit of our Collation for a Big|bellye'd
<PB N="273" REF="278">
Woman, that would die if we refu&s;ed her. Immediate|ly
we &s;ent her &s;ome of the faire&s;t, and quickly after the &s;ame
young Girl came again with a Gold Snuff-box, and told us the
<HI>Senora</HI> of the <HI>Ca&s;ita,</HI> that is the Lady of the little Hou&s;e, in|treated
us to accept of &s;ome Snuff for an Acknowledgment of
the Favour we had done her. It is the Fa&s;hion here to pre&s;ent
Snuff when they have a mind to expre&s;s their Friend&s;hip; we
&s;tayed &s;o long by the Water-&s;ide, that we re&s;olved to go no
further that the <HI>Carcuela,</HI> which is another of the King's Hou|&s;es,
but not &s;o hand&s;om as the <HI>Pardo,</HI> and &s;o neglected, that
there's nothing worth commending, but the Waters; we were
ill enough lodged there, though we laid in the very &s;ame Beds
his Maje&s;ty did; and we were very lucky in taking along with
us all Nece&s;&s;aries for Supper. After that we went into the
Gardens, which are in bad Order, the Fountains run Day and
Night, the Water there is &s;o good and in &s;uch plenty, that for
as little almo&s;t as one would de&s;ire, it might be made as plea|&s;ant
a Dwelling as any in the World. But 'tis not the Cu&s;tom
in this Country, from the King to private Per&s;ons, to keep &s;e|veral
Country Hou&s;es in good Repair, they let them go to ruin,
for want of &s;ome very &s;mall Reparations. Our Beds were &s;o ill,
that we were not loath to leave them early the next Morning to
go to the <HI>E&s;curial.</HI> We went by <HI>Monareto,</HI> where the Woods
begin, and a little further is the Park which belongs to the Con|vent
of the <HI>E&s;curial:</HI> For in effect it is one which <HI>Philip</HI> the II$
built among the Mountains, that &s;o he might the more ea&s;ily get
the Stone which he needed, of which there is &s;uch a prodigious
Quantity, that without &s;eeing it, one cannot conceive it, and
certainly it is one of the va&s;te&s;t Buildings we have in <HI>Europe:</HI>
We went up to it through a very long Walk of Elm Trees,
which are planted in four Rows, the great Gate is &s;tately adorn'd
with divers Marble Pillars rais'd one upon another, till they
reach up to the Statue of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> which &s;tands on the top,
the King's Arms are cut upon a certain Stone which is called the
Thunder-Stone, and is brought from <HI>Arabia,</HI> the cutting of
which co&s;t three&s;core thou&s;and Crowns. It is ea&s;ie to believe,
that having been at &s;o con&s;iderable a Charge for a thing &s;o little
u&s;eful, they would not &s;pare any Co&s;t for others which might
be nece&s;&s;ary and contribute to the Beauty of the Place. It is a
great Square Pile of Building; but beyond the Square there
runs out a Length, which contains the Buildings of the En|trance,
and are contriv'd to repre&s;ent the Form of the <HI>Gridiron</HI>
on which St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> (who is the Patron of the Mona&s;tery)
&s;uffered Martyrdom. It is build according to the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order&punc;

and very plain; the Square is divided in the middle, and one
of tho&s;e Divi&s;ions which looks upon the Order, opens it &s;elf
both ways into four other le&s;&s;er Squares, which are four Cloy|&s;ters
built al&s;o according to the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order, and who &s;ees one
of them, &s;ees all the re&s;t, the Building has nothing in it, either
as to its De&s;ign or Architecture, that is extraordinary; that
which is to be admired, is the Va&s;tne&s;s of it, being Three hun|dred
and eighty Paces in the Square, for be&s;ides tho&s;e four
Cloy&s;ters I have mentioned, the other Divi&s;ion of the Square,
&s;ubdivided into two, makes two other Piles of Building, one of
which is, the King's Quarters, and the other is the Colledge;
for there are in it abundance of Pen&s;ioners, whom the King
maintains to &s;tudy: The Friars that live in it are <HI>Hieronomites,</HI>
this Order is unknown in <HI>France,</HI> and it is aboli&s;ht in <HI>Italy,</HI>
becau&s;e a certain <HI>Hieronomite</HI> Fryar attempted at <HI>Milan</HI> the Life
of St. <HI>Charles Borromeo:</HI> But he did not hurt him, though he
&s;hot at him, and the Bullets pierced his Pontifical Habit; but
neverthele&s;s this Order is here in great E&s;teem, there are three
hundred Monks in the Convent of the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> they live much
after the &s;ame way of the <HI>Carthu&s;ians,</HI> they &s;peak little, and
pray much, and Women never come into their Church, but be|&s;ides
they ought to &s;tudy and preach.</P>
<P>But there's another thing yet, which makes this Building con|&s;iderable,
and that is, the nature of the Stone of which it is
built. It was taken out of the neighbouring Quarries, it is of
a grayi&s;h colour, the &s;harpe&s;t Air and &s;evere&s;t Weather makes
no impre&s;&s;ion on't, it does not &s;oil or grow dirty, but con&s;tant|ly
pre&s;erves that colour it had when it was taken up. <HI>Philip</HI> II.
was two and twenty years in building it, he enjoyed it thir|teen,
and then dy'd in't, This Structure co&s;t him &s;ix Millions
of Gold. <HI>Philip</HI> IV. added the <HI>Pantheon</HI> to it, that is to &s;ay a
<HI>Se$ulchre,</HI> like the <HI>Pantheon</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> contrived under the great
Altar of the Church, all of Marble, Ja&s;per and Perphiry, in
which there are &s;ix and twenty mo&s;t &s;tately Tombs incha&s;ed in
the Walls, and one goes down into it by a pair of Stairs all of
Ja&s;per. I fanceyd my &s;elf de&s;cending into &s;ome of tho&s;e en|chaun$ed
places which our Romances and Books of Chevalry talk
of. The Tabernacle, the Architecture of the Altar, the &s;teps
by which one a&s;cends to it, the Pyx or Box in which the Ho&s;t
is kept, are made all of one &s;ingle Agat, are &s;o many Wonders.
The Riches that are there, in precious Stones and Gold, is in|credible.
One &s;ingle Cupboard of Relicks (for there are four
in the four Chappels of the Church) infinitely exceeds the Trea|&s;ure
of St. <HI>Mark</HI> at Ven$$. The Ornaments of the Church
<PB N="275" REF="282">
are embroider'd with Pearls and precious Stones; and &s;o are the
Chalices and Ve&s;&s;els of precious Stones. The Candle&s;ticks and
the Lamps are of pure Gold. There are forty little Chappels,
and as many Altars, upon which are put every day forty &s;everal
Cloaths and Attires. The forepart of the great Altar is com|pos'd
of four Ranks of Ja&s;per Pillars, and one goes up to the
Altar by &s;eventeen Steps of Porphiry Stone. The Tabernacle
is beautified with &s;everal Pillars of Agat, and divers curious
Figures of Metal and Chry&s;tal. One can &s;ee nothing about the
Tabernacle but Gold, Azur Stone, and other Stones &s;o tran&s;pa|rent,
that through them the Sacrament (which is kept in an A|gat
Ve&s;&s;el) is ea&s;ily perceived. This Tabernacle is e&s;teemed at
a Million of Crowns. There are eight pair of Organs, the Chairs
or Seats in the Quire are made of rare Wood, which comes from
the <HI>Indies,</HI> curiou&s;ly wrought after the pattern of tho&s;e of St.
<HI>Dominick</HI> at <HI>Boulogne.</HI> The Cloy&s;ters of the Mona&s;tery are ex|tream
fine, in the middle there's a Flower Garden, and a Chap|pel
which opens four ways&punc; who&s;e Roof is &s;upported with Por|phiry
Pillars, between which there are Niches in which are pla|ced
the four Evangeli&s;ts with an Angel, and the &s;everal Crea|tures
made of white Marble bigger then Nature, who throw out
Torrents of Water into Marble Ba&s;ins. The Chappel is arch'd
with curious Architecture, and pav'd with black and white Mar|ble.
There are divers Pictures of an ine&s;timable value, and in
the Chapter-Room, which is very large there is be&s;ides mo&s;t
excellent Pictures, two Ba&s;s-Reliefs all of Agat, two foot and a
half long, which cannot be valued. As to the Church, it has
nothing extraordinary in its Structure, it is bigger than that of
the Je&s;uits in St. <HI>Anthony's</HI> Street at <HI>Paris,</HI> but of the &s;ame form,
except that like their Hou&s;e, it is of the <HI>Dorick</HI> Order. <HI>Bra|manto</HI>
the famous <HI>Italian</HI> Architect, drew the Model and De|&s;ign
of it. The King and Queens Apartments are not &s;tately,
but <HI>Philip</HI> II. intended this only for a Hou&s;e of Prayer and Re|tirement,
the Church and the Library were the things he took
mo&s;t care to adorn. <HI>Titian</HI> the famous Painter, and divers o|thers
be&s;ides have exhau&s;ted all their Art and Skill in curiou&s;ly
painting the Galleries of the Library, which indeed are admira|ble,
not only for the excellent Painting, but for a hundred thou|&s;and
Volumes that are there, without reckoning the original
Manu&s;cripts of &s;everal Fathers and Doctors of the Church, which
are delicately bound and gilt. You'll ea&s;ily gue&s;s at the bigne&s;s
of the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> when I have told you that there are in it &s;even|teen
Cloy&s;ters, two and twenty Courts, eleven thou&s;and Win|dows,
above eight hundred Pillars, and an infinite number of
<PB N="276" REF="283">
Parlours, Halls and Chambers. A little after the Death of <HI>Phi|lip</HI>
II. there was taken from the Fryars of the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> a certain
E&s;tate in Lands (called <HI>Campillo</HI>) which the late King had given
them, and was worth eighteen thou&s;and Crowns <HI>per Annum,</HI> and
this was done by virtue of a Clau&s;e in his Will, by which he
revoked all the immen&s;e Donations, which in his Life time he
had given.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Bragance</HI> being at Court in King <HI>Philip</HI> the Se|con'ds
time, he had a mind they &s;hould go with him to the
<HI>E&s;curial,</HI> that he might &s;ee that &s;tately Pile of Building. And
as he had the care of &s;hewing it to him, told him, It was
built in performance of a Vow which <HI>Philip</HI> II. made at the
Battel of St. <HI>Quintin,</HI> the Duke replyed, <HI>He that made &s;o great
a Vow, mu&s;t needs have a great Terror upon him.</HI> And now in
mentioning this King, I remember to have heard, that <HI>Charles</HI> V.
recommended to him the pre&s;ervation of the three Keys of
<HI>Spain.</HI> The&s;e were the <HI>Streights-mouth, Flu&s;hing</HI> in <HI>Zealand,</HI>
and <HI>Cadiz.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Moors</HI> have the fir&s;t, the <HI>Dutch</HI> the
&s;econd, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had the la&s;t, but the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;oon
recovered it from them.</P>
<P>The <HI>E&s;curial</HI> is built upon a de&s;cent of &s;ome Rocks in a de|&s;ert
and barren Place, and environed with Hills; the Village
&s;tands below it, and has but few Hou&s;es in't; it's in a manner
always cold Weather there. The extent of the Gardens and
the Park is a prodigious thing to &s;ee, in which one meets with
Woods, Plains, and a va&s;t Hou&s;e in the mid&s;t, in which the
Keepers lodge; it abounds with all &s;orts of Deer and Fowl.</P>
<P>After having &s;een a Place which &s;o highly de&s;erves our admi|ration,
we all left it, and as we had vi&s;ited the Royal Hou&s;es of
<HI>Pardo</HI> and <HI>Carcu$la,</HI> we return'd over the Mountains, which is
a nearer way, but very trouble&s;ome. We came by <HI>Colmenar,</HI>
and coa&s;ting along the little River of <HI>Guadarana,</HI> we pa&s;t
through <HI>Rozas</HI> and <HI>Aravaca,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Madrid,</HI> where we
learnt that the Queens Hou&s;hold were ju&s;t going away to meet
her upon the Frontier. We immediately went to the Palace to
bid a$iew to the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> and the other Ladies.
The King had made them all be mounted, that he might &s;ee
after what manner they would be on the day of her Entry;
for this rea&s;on all the Gardens, and Doors every way were kept
clo&s;e &s;hut and guarded, and no Man was to enter there. The
young Court Ladies lookt well enough, but good God! what
$$$ures were the Dutche&s;s <HI>de Terra Nova,</HI> and <HI>Donna Maria
de Alarcon,</HI> who were the Governantes of the Queens Maids;
they rid every one upon a Mule &s;hod with Silver, and all friz'd
<PB N="277" REF="284">
with a large hou&s;ing of black Velvet, like that the Phy&s;icians
in <HI>Paris</HI> ride with upon their Hor&s;es. The&s;e Ladies, dre&s;t like
Widows, (which I have already de&s;crib'd to you) very old
and ugly, with moro&s;e and imperious Looks, wore broad Hats,
tyed with &s;trings under their Chin; and twenty Gentlemen
which walkt a foot by their &s;ides, held them up, le&s;t they &s;hould
fall. They would never have &s;uffered the&s;e Men to have
touch'd them in that manner, had not they fear'd breaking their
Necks. For you mu&s;t know, dear Cou&s;en, that though every
Lady has two Gentlemen U&s;hers, and that they go with them
where ever they go, yet they never give them their Hand.
They walk by their &s;ides, and pre&s;ent to them their Elbows
wrapt in their Cloaks, which makes their Arms look mon&s;trous
thick. The Ladies do not come near them; but that which
is yet more &s;trange, if the Queen in walking &s;hould happen to
fall, unle&s;s her Ladies were near her to help her up, though
there were an hundred Gentlemen there, &s;he mu&s;t be plea&s;ed,
either to ri&s;e by her &s;elf, or lie all day upon the Ground, for
none dare take her up.</P>
<P>We &s;pent part of the Afternoon in looking at the&s;e Ladies;
the Equipage they had indeed was very rich, but very poorly
and dully contriv'd. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Terra Nova</HI> had alone,
&s;ix Litters of Velvet of various colours, and all embroider'd, and
forty Mules, who&s;e hou&s;&s;ings were as co&s;tly as ever I &s;aw any.
You will not hear from me again, dear Cou&s;en, before the
Queen is come hither. While the King is gone to meet her,
and the whole Court is ab&s;ent, my Kin&s;woman will go into
<HI>Andalou&s;ia,</HI> about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he has there. I might &s;end you
a &s;hort Relation of our little Journey, if I could be a&s;&s;ur'd it
would plea&s;e you. I mo&s;t heartily embrace you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole Court is return'd, and in my Memoirs you'll find,
dear Cou&s;en, the particulars of the Queens Journey. The
King and &s;he were both together in one Coach, and the Curtains
being all open, I &s;aw her at her arrival here: She was dre&s;t af|ter
<PB N="278" REF="285">
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> way, and I did not think that &s;he lookt le&s;s hand|&s;ome
in this, than in her <HI>French</HI> Garb, but the King was dre&s;t
<HI>a-la-Sch$mberg,</HI> which is the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Habit for the Country, and
'tis almo&s;t like the <HI>French.</HI> I have heard it told how &s;trangely
the Queen was &s;urpris'd the fir&s;t time &s;he had the Honour to &s;ee
him, he had on a clo&s;e body'd Coat of grey <HI>Barragon,</HI> very &s;hort
and wide, Velvet Breeches, Stockings of <HI>Pel$,</HI> that is, raw Silk,
which they work &s;o very loo&s;e, that their Skin appears through
them; this Silk is as &s;mall as a Hair, and though they be very
&s;trait, yet the King pulls them on at once, and &s;o he'll tear &s;ome|times
twenty pair one after another. He had al&s;o a very fine
Cravat, which the Queen &s;ent him, but it was tyed a little too
loo&s;e: His Hair was put behind his Ears, and he wore a grey
Hat. All the Journey, which was very long, they &s;at clo&s;e to
each other in a large Coach, and &s;eldom could under&s;tand one
another but by &s;ome certain &s;igns, for the King cannot &s;peak a
word of <HI>French,</HI> and the Queen could &s;peak but very little <HI>Spa|ni&s;h.</HI>
Upon their arrival at <HI>Madrid</HI> they went to &s;ing <HI>Te Deum</HI>
at our Lady <HI>de Atocha</HI> attended by all the Per&s;ons of Quality, and
a multitude of the People, that made the Air re&s;ound with Ac|clamations
of Joy. Afterwards their Maje&s;ties went to <HI>Buen
Retiro,</HI> becau&s;e the Apartments in the Palace were not yet
ready, and that the Queen was not to remain there till &s;he had
made her Entry. This time mu&s;t needs have been very tedi|ous
to her, for &s;he &s;aw no body but the <HI>Camerera Major</HI> and her
Ladies. She's forc'd to lead a Life &s;o much again&s;t her Incli|nations,
that &s;he has need of all that Di&s;cretion and Sweetne&s;s
of Temper &s;he's po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of to be able to endure it. She has
not &s;o much as the Liberty to &s;ee the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, to be
&s;hort, 'tis a perpetual $orment. All the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ladies love
her dearly, and among&s;t them&s;elves pity her.</P>
<P>I was &s;ometime ago at the Counte&s;s of <HI>Villambro&s;a</HI>'s, and in a
great deal of Company. The Marchione&s;s <HI>de la Fuenta</HI> came in
there, and as they are extream &s;uper&s;titious in this Country, &s;o
&s;he told them, like one affrighted, that being with the Queen,
who looking her &s;elf in a great Gla&s;s, and laying her hand gent|ly
upon't, it crackt from top to bottom, and that the Queen be|held
it without being in the lea&s;t moved, but even laught at the
Con&s;ternation that all the Ladies about her were in, telling
them, it betrayed a weakne&s;s of Mind to take &s;uch notice of
things and Accidents as might proceed from natural Cau&s;es.
They di&s;cour&s;ed and argued a great while upon this matter, and
with deeps &s;ighs &s;aid, that their Queen would not live long.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="286">
She al&s;o told us, that the <HI>Queen</HI> was much more di&s;turbed at
the incivility of the <HI>Camerera Major,</HI> who &s;eeing &s;ome of her
Hairs out of place on her Forehead, &s;pit on her fingers to lay
them &s;mooth, upon which the Queen &s;tayed her Arm, telling her
in a Maje&s;tick way, that the be&s;t E&s;&s;ence there, was not too
good, and that taking her Handkerchief, &s;he was a great while
a cleaning that part of her Hair which this piece of Antiquity
had &s;o unhand&s;omely wet. It is no uncommon thing here, to
wet ones head all over, the better to &s;mooth and make the Hair
&s;hine, the fir&s;t time my Head was dre&s;t after the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mode,
one of my Relations Women undertook this curious piece of
work, &s;he was no le&s;s than three hours tugging and pulling my
Head, and finding that my Hair, which is naturally curling,
would not comply, without &s;aying a word to me, &s;he dipt a
great Spunge twice in a Ba&s;on of Water, and baptized me &s;o
hand&s;omly, that I was laid up with a Cold for a Month.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Queen,</HI> it would draw pity from one to
&s;ee how this <HI>Camerera</HI> treats her, I am well a&s;&s;ured, that &s;he
neither &s;uffers her to have &s;o much as a &s;ingle Hair curled, nor
to come near her Chamber Windows, nor to &s;peak to any body,
and yet the <HI>King</HI> loves the <HI>Queen</HI> with all his Heart, and for the
mo&s;t part eats with her, and that without Ceremony, &s;o that
very often when the <HI>Maids of Honour</HI> are laying the Cloth, the
<HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen</HI> will divert them&s;elves in helping them, one
will lay the Cloth, and t'other a Napkin: The <HI>Queen</HI> has her
Meat dre&s;t after the <HI>French</HI> way, and the <HI>King</HI> his after the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h.</HI>
He has a Woman Cook to dre&s;s all his Victuals, but the
<HI>Queen</HI> endeavours to bring him to like the <HI>Ragous</HI> that are made
for her, but he cannot abide them. But now you mu&s;t not ima|gine,
that their <HI>Maje&s;ties</HI> are &s;urrounded with their <HI>Courtiers</HI>
when they are at Dinner, at the mo&s;t, there's only &s;ome <HI>Ladies</HI>
of the <HI>Pallace,</HI> a few <HI>Menins,</HI> but a great many Male and Fe|male
<HI>Dwarfs.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Queen</HI> made her Entry the 13<HI>th</HI> of <HI>January;</HI> after all
the Pa&s;&s;ages and Avenues of the great Road which leads to <HI>Buen
Retiro</HI> were &s;topt, and all Coaches forbid to come that way,
there was a <HI>Triumphal Arch</HI> built, and the <HI>Queen</HI> painted upon't.
It was al&s;o covered with divers Garlands, and had &s;everal Em|blems
and other things painted, it was &s;et in the way by which
the <HI>Queen</HI> mu&s;t pa&s;s to go into <HI>Madrid,</HI> on each &s;ide there was
a &s;ort of a Gallery which had places contriv'd in them, to &s;hew
the Arms of the &s;everal Kingdoms under the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominion,
joyning one to another, by certain Pillars which &s;upported &s;ome
gilt Statues, every one of which repre&s;ented Crowns and In|&s;criptions
<PB N="280" REF="287">
which had relation to tho&s;e Kingdoms.</P>
<P>This Gallery reached to the Triumphal Gate on the great
Boad, which was very rich and adorned with &s;everal Statues,
where likewi&s;e there were four beautiful and young Maids dre&s;t
like <HI>Nymphs</HI> waiting for the Queen, and holding in their hands
Baskets of Flowers, ready to &s;trow them on the Ground as &s;he
pa&s;t, hardly was one out of this Gate or Arch but a &s;econd ap|peared,
and &s;o for a great way one after another was &s;een. The&s;e
were adorned with the <HI>Kings Council,</HI> that of the <HI>Inqui&s;ition,</HI>
the <HI>Council</HI> of the <HI>Indies,</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI> of <HI>State,</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> of <HI>Flan|ders,</HI>
and other Places, under &s;o many gilt Statues; that of
Ju&s;tice was higher rai&s;ed than all the re&s;t. A little further was
repre&s;ented the <HI>Golden Age,</HI> accompany'd with the <HI>Law, Re|wards,
Protection</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments.</HI> The Temple of <HI>Faith</HI> was
exhibited in a Picture, <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Fidelity</HI> opened the Gate, and
<HI>Joy</HI> came forth to receive the new <HI>Queen.</HI> There was be&s;ides,
a Picture which &s;hewed the Reception <HI>Solomon</HI> gave the <HI>Queen</HI>
of <HI>Sheba,</HI> and another where <HI>Deborah</HI> was giving of Laws to her
People. There were al&s;o the Statues of <HI>Ceres, A&s;trea, &V;nion,
Vertue, Life, Safety, Time,</HI> the <HI>Earth, Tranquility, Peace, Great|ne&s;s,
Re&s;t, Themis,</HI> and <HI>Liberality.</HI> Among&s;t all the Paintings
I took notice of, that where <HI>Aeneas</HI> is de&s;cending into Hell;
<HI>Cerberus</HI> chained by the <HI>Sybile,</HI> the <HI>Ely&s;ian Fields,</HI> where <HI>An|chi&s;es</HI>
&s;hewed his Son who &s;hould &s;ucceed him in his Po&s;terity.
The re&s;t were filled with an infinite number of <HI>Hierogliphicks.</HI>
The Queen &s;topt at the third Arch, which was over again&s;t a
very fine <HI>Parterre</HI> in her way, in it were falls of Water, Grot|tas,
Fountains and white Marble Statues. Nothing could be
more plea&s;ant than this Garden: It belonged to the <HI>Fryars</HI> of St.
<HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Paulo,</HI> who built it. The fourth Gate was in the
middle of the Place called <HI>Del Sol,</HI> it was no le&s;s glorious than
the others by the Gold, Pictures, Statues and Motto's about it.</P>
<P>The Street where the <HI>Furriers</HI> dwelt was all full of &s;eeming A|nimals,
though their Skin was &s;o artificially &s;tufft, that any Bo|dy
would have taken them for living Tygars, Lions, Bears, and
Panthers. The fifth Gate, which was that of <HI>Guadalajara</HI>
had its peculiar Ornaments, and after that, the <HI>Queen</HI> pa&s;t in|to
the Gold&s;miths Street, the &s;ide of which, was &s;et full of An|gels
of pure Silver, there were &s;een al&s;o divers Bucklers of Gold,
upon which were contrived the <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Queens</HI> Names with
their Arms, in Pearls, Rubies, Diamonds, Emeraulds, and other
Stones &s;o fine and rich, that the Skilful &s;aid, there was to the
value of above twelve Millions. In the <HI>Placa Mayor</HI> there was
an Amphitheater &s;et full of Statues, and adorned with Paint|ings.
<PB N="281" REF="288">
The la&s;t Gate was near that, in the middle of the fir&s;t
Front of the <HI>Queen</HI> Mothers Pallace, was &s;een <HI>Apollo,</HI> all the
<HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> the Picture of the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen</HI> on Hor&s;eback, and
divers others things which I did not mind &s;o much to give you
an Account of them. The <HI>Pallace</HI> Court was &s;urrounded with
young Men and Maids, which repre&s;ented all the Rivers both
great and &s;mall of <HI>Spain,</HI> they were Crowned with Reeds and Wa|ter
lillies, with Pots overturn'd, and the re&s;t of their Attire &s;ui|table.
They complimented the <HI>Queen</HI> in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> there
were al&s;o erected in this Court, two Ca&s;tles of artificial Fire|works.
All the <HI>Pallace</HI> was hung the riche&s;t Tapi&s;try
that belonged to the Crown, and there are but few Places in
the World where there is finer &s;een, two Chariots full of <HI>Mu&s;i|cians</HI>
went before their Maje&s;ties.</P>
<P>The Magi&s;trates of the City came out of their <HI>Publick</HI> Hou&s;e
in their Robes, which were made of <HI>Brocado</HI> embroidered with
Gold; they wore little Hats buttoned up with Plumes of Fea|thers,
and were mounted upon very fine Hor&s;es, they came to
pre&s;ent the Keys of the City to the <HI>Queen</HI> and to receive her
under a Canopy. The <HI>King</HI> and the <HI>Queen</HI> Mother went in a
Coach all open that the People might &s;ee them, as far as the
Counte&s;s of <HI>Ognates</HI> Hou&s;e, where the <HI>Queen</HI> came to them.</P>
<P>Six Trumpeters in black and red Suites in company of the
City Kettle Drums mounted upon fine Hor&s;es, who&s;e Hou&s;&s;ings
were of black Velvet, marched before the <HI>Alcade</HI> of the <HI>Court,</HI>
the <HI>Knights</HI> of the three <HI>Military</HI> Orders, namely, St. <HI>James,
Calatrava,</HI> and <HI>Alcantara</HI> followed after in Cloaks all embroid|er'd
with Gold, and their Hatts covered with Plumes of Fea|thers;
after them went the <HI>Tutulados De Ca&s;tille,</HI> and the Of|ficers
of the <HI>Kings</HI> Hou&s;hold, they wore white Robes, and mo&s;t
of them were <HI>Grandees</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> their Hatts were trim'd with
Diamonds and Pearl, and their Magnificence appeared every
way; they had mo&s;t admirable Hor&s;es, every one had abun|dance
of Liveries, and their Footmens Suits were of Gold
and Silver <HI>Brocado</HI> mixt with coloured Silk, which lookt very
well.</P>
<P>The <HI>Queen</HI> rid upon a curious Hor&s;e of <HI>Andalou&s;ia,</HI> which
the Marque&s;s <HI>De Villa Mayna,</HI> her fir&s;t Gentlemen U&s;her, led by
the Reins, her Cloaths were &s;o richly embroidered, that one
could &s;ee no Stuff, &s;he wore a Hat trim'd with a Plume of Fea|thers,
and the Pearl called the <HI>Peregrina,</HI> which is as big as a
&s;mall Pear, and of an ine&s;timable Value, her Hair hung loo&s;e
upon her Shoulders, and upon her Forehead, her neck was a
little bare and &s;he wore a &s;mall <HI>Fardingal,</HI> &s;he had upon her</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="289">
Every <HI>Courtier,</HI> and even the <HI>Emba&s;&s;adors</HI> are obliged when
they go into the King's Chamber to put on certain little Lawn
Cuffs, which they wear quite flat upon their &s;leeves, there are
Shops in the Guard-room, where the <HI>Lords</HI> hire them, and re|turn
them when they come out. In like manner all the Ladies
are to wear <HI>Patins</HI> when they go into the <HI>Queens</HI> pre|&s;ence,
I think I have already told you that the&s;e are a kind of
<HI>Sandals</HI> into which the Shooe is $a&s;tned, and which rai&s;es them
up very high, if they &s;hould appear before the Queen without
the&s;e <HI>Sandals,</HI> &s;he would take it very ill.</P>
<P>The Queens of <HI>Spain</HI> have none but Widows and Maids a|bout
them, the <HI>Pallace</HI> is &s;o full of them, that one can &s;ee no|thing
el&s;e through the Latices and in the Balconies. And here's
one thing &s;eems to me very &s;ingular, which is, That a Man al|though
he be Married is allowed to declare him&s;elf a <HI>Lover</HI> or
<HI>Gallant</HI> of a <HI>Lady</HI> of the <HI>Pallace,</HI> and for her &s;ake to commit
all the Follies and to &s;pend all the Money he can, without being
in the lea&s;t blamed for it. One &s;hall &s;ee the&s;e <HI>Gallants</HI> in the
<HI>Court,</HI> and all the Ladies in the Windows, where 'tis their dai|ly
Employment to di&s;cour&s;e with, and entertain one another
by their Fingers: For you mu&s;t know that their <HI>Hands</HI> &s;peak a
Language that is perfectly intelligible; and as it might be
gue&s;t as if it was always alike, and that the &s;ame Signs always
meant the &s;ame things, &s;o they agree with their <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> upon
certain private Signs and Actions, which no body el&s;e under|&s;tands.
This kind of <HI>Love</HI> is publick, a Man mu&s;t be of a pe|culiar
&s;ort of Wit and Humour dextrou&s;ly to manage the&s;e In|trigues
and to be accepted by the Ladies, for they are wonder|ful
delicate and nice, they do not talk like other People. In
the <HI>Pallace</HI> there reigns a certain Genius and Strain of Wit,
quite different from that in the City, and &s;o peculiar, that one
mu&s;t learn it as they do an Art or a Trade. When the <HI>Queen</HI>
goes abroad, all, or however the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Ladies</HI>
go with her; then the <HI>Gallants,</HI> who are con&s;tantly upon the
Watch, go a foot by their Coach &s;ides, that they may enjoy
their Conver&s;ation. It is really a good Sport to &s;ee how the&s;e
poor Lovers dirty them&s;elves, for the Streets are horrid na&s;ty;
but then, the more dirty the more gallant. When the <HI>Queen</HI>
returns home late, there are carried before the Coaches where
her <HI>Ladies</HI> are, forty or fifty <HI>Flamboys</HI> of white Wax, and this
&s;ometimes makes a very glorious Illumination; for there are
&s;everal Coaches, in every one divers <HI>Ladies,</HI> &s;o that fre|quently,
one may &s;ee above a thou&s;and <HI>Flamboys,</HI> be&s;ides
tho&s;e the Queen has.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="290">
When the Ladies of the <HI>Pallace</HI> are let Blood, the Chyrurge|on
takes a mighty care of the Ligature, Fillet, or any Cloth or
Handkerchief upon which any of the Blood of the fair one has
fallen; for he never fails to make a rich Pre&s;ent of it to the <HI>Ca|vallero</HI>
that loves her, and this is lookt upon to be a worthy Oc|ca&s;ion
for a Man to ruine him&s;elf to all intents; there have
been &s;ome &s;o extravagantly fooli&s;h, as to give the Chyrurgeon
a Spoon, a Fork, or a Knife, which may be the Stock of a great
many we know; no, no, I a&s;&s;ure you, this extends to the va|lue
of Three or four thou&s;and Crowns, and this is a Cu&s;tom
&s;o rooted among&s;t them, that a Man had rather feed upon no|thing
but Radi&s;hes and Leeks all the Year long, than not to
perform what he is obliged to do upon the&s;e &s;ort of Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Few of the Ladies of the Palace leave it without being very
advantageou&s;ly married; there are al&s;o the Queens <HI>Menines,</HI>
who are &s;o very Young when they come to her, that &s;he has
&s;ome not above &s;ix or &s;even Years old; the&s;e are Children of
the highe&s;t Quality. I have &s;een &s;ome of them more beautiful
than the <HI>God of Love</HI> him&s;elf was ever painted.</P>
<P>On &s;ome &s;olemn Days, when the Ladies of the <HI>Pallace</HI> go a|broad,
or when the Queen gives Audience, every Lady has the
Priviledge to place by her &s;ides two <HI>Cavalleros</HI> who put on their
Hats before their <HI>Maje&s;ties,</HI> although they be not <HI>Grandees</HI> of
<HI>Spain;</HI> they are called <HI>Embevecidos,</HI> that is, <HI>Drunk with Love,</HI>
and &s;o tran&s;ported with their Pa&s;&s;ion, and the Plea&s;ure of being
near their <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es,</HI> that they are uncapable of minding any
thing el&s;e, they are permitted to be cover'd for the &s;ame Rea&s;on
that mad Men are, who under&s;tand not their Obligation to De|cency
and good Manners, but yet to enjoy this Liberty, they mu&s;t
have leave from their Ladies, otherwi&s;e they dare not pre&s;ume
to attempt it.</P>
<P>There is no other Diver&s;ion at Court, than Plays; but during
the Carnaval, they empty Eggs by a little hole in the Shell,
and fill them full of &s;weet &s;cented Water, and
then &s;top them up again with Wax, and when the King is at
a Play, he throws the&s;e at every body, and every one in imita|tion
of his Maje&s;ty throw them likewi&s;e at one another; this
perfumed Rain makes the Air very &s;weet, but withal wets People
pretty hand&s;omly, and this is one of their greate&s;t Pa&s;times,
there's hardly any body at this &s;ea&s;on but what carries a hun|dred
of the&s;e Egg-&s;hells, that are either filled with Orange flow|er,
or &s;ome other &s;weet &s;cented Water, and as they go along in
their Coaches throw them in Folks Faces: At this time the Peo|ple
al&s;o plea&s;e them&s;elves after their fa&s;hion; for example,
<PB N="286" REF="291">
they'll break off the neck of a Bottle, and tye the part that is
within the Wicker to the Tail of a Dog, and &s;ometimes you
&s;hall &s;ee above two thou&s;and run after him.</P>
<P>The King's Dwarf is the prettie&s;t that ever I &s;aw, his Name
is <HI>Lovi&s;illo;</HI> he was born in <HI>Flanders,</HI> he is extream little, and
exactly well proportion'd, he has a hand&s;ome Face, an admira|ble
Complexion, and not only wittier than one can imagine, but
withal very wi&s;e and knowing. When he goes to take the Air,
there's a Groom to wait on him, who rides upon one Hor&s;e, and
carries another before him, which is &s;o very &s;mall, that he may
properly be termed a <HI>Dwarf</HI> Hor&s;e, and is as hand&s;ome for his
kind as his Ma&s;ter is for his. This Hor&s;e is brought to the
Place where <HI>Lovi&s;illo</HI> is to mount him, for he would be almo&s;t
tyred if he was to walk &s;o far; and it is really a great plea&s;ure
to &s;ee the Dexterity of this little Animal and his Ma&s;ter, when
he orders him like a managed Hor&s;e. I do a&s;&s;ure you that when
he is upon his Back, they do not both make above three quar|ters
of an Ell in height. He &s;aid very &s;eriou&s;ly t'other day,
that he would fight the Bull at the fir&s;t <HI>Bull Fea&s;t,</HI> for the &s;ake
of his Mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Donna Elvire.</HI> This is a little Girl about &s;even
or eight years of Age, but wonderful beautiful. The Queen
commanded him to be her Gallant. It is a great Happine&s;s for
this Child that &s;he is fallen into the Queens hands. I'll tell
you how it happened.</P>
<P>The Fathers of Mercy went to redeem a certain number of
Slaves which they brought to <HI>Madrid,</HI> and according to their
Cu&s;tom of coming through the City in Proce&s;&s;ion, the Queen
chanced to ca&s;t her Eyes upon a Captive Woman which led two
little Girls by the hand, they &s;eemed to be Si&s;ters, but there was
this difference between them, that one was extream hand&s;ome,
and the other as ugly. The Queen made her come to her, and
asked her if &s;he was the Mother of tho&s;e two Children; &s;he
an&s;wered that &s;he was Mother only to the ugly one. And how
came you by the other, &s;aid the Queen? Madam, reply'd the
Woman, we were in a Ve&s;&s;el in which there was a great Lady big
with Child, but we did not know who &s;he was only by her At|tendance
and the Richne&s;s of her Cloaths, it was ea&s;ie to think
&s;he mu&s;t be of Quality. After a long and &s;harp fight we were
taken, the greate&s;t part of her People were killed, and &s;he was
&s;o frighted, that &s;he fell in Travail, and as &s;oon as &s;he was de|livered
dyed. I was by her, and &s;eeing this poor little Creature
without a Nur&s;e and ready to peri&s;h, I re&s;olved to nouri&s;h it up
with my own, if 'twas po&s;&s;ible. As &s;oon as the <HI>Cor&s;aire$</HI> were
Ma&s;ters of our Ship, they divided the booty among&s;t them|&s;elves;
<PB N="287" REF="292">
they were in two Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;o each took away with
them the Lot that was fallen to them. Tho&s;e remaining Women,
and other Servants which belonged to this Lady were on one
&s;ide of the Ve&s;&s;el, and I on the other; &s;o that, Madam, conti|nued
the Woman, I was never able to learn what or who the
Per&s;on was, who&s;e Child I &s;aved. I now look upon her as my
own Daughter, and &s;he believes I am her Mother. So charita|ble
a Deed, &s;ays the Queen, &s;hall not go unrewarded; I &s;hall
take care of you, and the little <HI>Incognito</HI> I will keep. And in|deed
the Queen loves it &s;o extreamly, that the Girl always
wears very rich Cloaths. She follows her Maje&s;ty every where,
and talks to her with that grace and freedom as &s;ufficiently de|clares
her to be of no mean Original. Perhaps time may di&s;co|ver
who &s;he is.</P>
<P>Here are none of tho&s;e &s;olemn and plea&s;ant Fe&s;tivals which
are at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> when the Ladies have the honour to eat with
their Maje&s;ties. All is very re&s;erved in this Court, and in my
Opinion, nothing but a general and con&s;tant habit could pre|vent
abundance of things from being extream tedious to them.
Tho&s;e Ladies which do not actually dwell at Court, never come
to it, but when the Queen &s;ends for them, and &s;he is not allow'd
to &s;end for them often neither. She lives for the mo&s;t part with|out
any other Company than her Women, there was never any
Life more melancholy than hers.</P>
<P>When &s;he goes a hunting (and you mu&s;t know, that of all
the Queens that have reigned in <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;he's the fir&s;t that has had
this Liberty) and is come to the place appointed for mounting on
Hor&s;eback, &s;he mu&s;t &s;et her feet upon the Coach boot, and &s;o
throw her &s;elf upon her Hor&s;e. It is not long &s;ince &s;he had one,
that being a little &s;hy and skitti&s;h, would &s;tart away as &s;he leapt
upon him, and &s;o &s;he had a mo&s;t grievous fall. When the King
is there, he a&s;&s;i&s;ts her, but no body el&s;e dare come &s;o near the
Queens of <HI>Spain</HI> as to touch them and help them on Hor&s;eback,
they had rather they &s;hould be hurt, and that their Lives &s;hould
be expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t danger.</P>
<P>She has fourteen Matre&s;&s;es or Quilts upon her Bed; there's
neither Flocks nor Feather-beds u&s;ed here, the&s;e <HI>Quilts</HI> being
made of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wool, which is the fine&s;t in the World; they
are not above three fingers thick, &s;o that her Bed is no higher
than one of ours in <HI>France.</HI> They make the&s;e Matre&s;&s;es &s;o thin
that they may the more ea&s;ily be turned and removed, and in|deed
I have ob&s;erved that they keep hollower, and are not near
&s;o hard.</P>
<P>It is the Cu&s;tom&punc; in <HI>Madrid,</HI> for the Ma&s;ter or Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of
<PB N="288" REF="293">
the Hou&s;e to go before tho&s;e that come to &s;ee them, they think
this is a piece of great Civility, to leave, &s;ay they, a Per&s;on in the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that is in the Room. As to the Women they do
not ki&s;s one another in their Salutation, they only pre&s;ent their
hand without Glove.</P>
<P>They have another Cu&s;tom, which I think odd and peculiar e|nough,
and that is, when a Daughter has a mind to be marry'd,
and is the elde&s;t, and has already made her choice, though both
her Father and Mother are again&s;t the Match, &s;he need only go
to the Curate of the Pari&s;h and tell him the Matter, and the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
is done. Immediately he takes her from her Parents Hou&s;e,
and either puts her into a Convent, or to &s;ome devout Lady,
where &s;he remains for a little time; afterwards, if &s;he per&s;e|veres
in her Re&s;olution, the Father and Mother are obliged to
give her a Portion &s;uitable to her Quality and their E&s;tate, and
in &s;pight of them &s;he is marry'd. Partly upon this Account it
is, that &s;uch care is taken to keep their Daughters clo&s;e, and to
let no body &s;peak to them, and &s;o to make it difficult for them
to take any mea&s;ures for the management of an Intreague. O|therwi&s;e,
provided the <HI>Cavallero</HI> be a Gentleman, it is &s;uffici|ent,
and he may marry his Mi&s;tre&s;s, though &s;he &s;hould prove to
be the Daughter of a <HI>Grandee</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Since my being in this Country, I think I have not neglect|ed
informing you of every thing; I will now proceed to fini&s;h
my Memoirs of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;eeing tho&s;e I fir&s;t &s;ent you
plea&s;e you &s;o well. I &s;hall &s;end you the re&s;t as fa&s;t as any thing
happens and offers it &s;elf, that is worth your Curio&s;ity and no|tice.
I do al&s;o promi&s;e you to write you that Relation you de|&s;ire
of me. But for all the&s;e little Trifles, I mu&s;t beg you, dear
Cou&s;en, to grant me &s;omething that is con&s;iderable, and that is,
the Continuation of your Friend&s;hip, for which I have a ju&s;t
value.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>OF THE
Pre&s;ent State of SPAIN,
To the Year 1700.</HEAD>
<P>YOU de&s;ired in your la&s;t &s;ome Account of the Court of
<HI>Spain,</HI> and more particularly touching the Nobility
thereof, which I &s;hall endeavour to &s;atisfie you in &s;o
far as is come to my knowledge, for you mu&s;t under&s;tand the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> are a proud re&s;erv'd &s;ort of People, with great opi|nion
of their own, and as mean of other Nations, that makes
them very difficult of acce&s;s, and &s;o by con&s;equence, a hard
thing for a Stranger to make that Friend&s;hip among Per&s;ons of
Quality, which is nece&s;&s;ary for a due Information of matter
concerning Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank, which con&s;ideration joy|ned
to the natural jealou&s;ie, of the Men of that Country, as well
as the accu&s;tomary re&s;ervedne&s;s of the Women, makes me often
&s;mile to hear our travelled Gallants relate their Friend&s;hip with
the Gentlemen, and Intreagues with the Ladies with &s;o much
fal&s;hood and confidence.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent King is <HI>Charles</HI> the II. the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> V.
of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> his Ance&s;tor being born the fir&s;t of that
Name: This Prince was born Sunday the &s;ixth of <HI>November</HI> 61,
at 12 &frac12; at Noon, to the great joy of his Father <HI>Phillip</HI> IV.
and Mother <HI>Donna Mariana de Au&s;tria</HI> Si&s;ter of the pre&s;ent Em|perour,
his Nephew the Dauphin of <HI>France</HI> being born the
fir&s;t, his Father died the 25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>November</HI> 65. The next
day the Councels went in State, and proclaimed the new King
and ki&s;t his Hand. On the 8<HI>th</HI> of <HI>November</HI> the Town of <HI>Ma|drid</HI>
lift up the Standard for the new King, by the Hands of
<HI>Don Ramin De Gu&s;man,</HI> Duke of <HI>Medina de los Tores,</HI> accom|panied
by the Nobility, King at Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Having mounted
<PB N="286" REF="295">
a Scaffold richly covered in the great <HI>Piazza,</HI> the olde&s;t King
of Arms having proclaimed &s;ilence three times, the Duke lifts up
the Standard crying three times (<HI>Ca&s;tilla</HI> for the Catholick
King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second of that name, whom God pre&s;erve)
all the People crying out <HI>Viva.</HI> They not u&s;ing to Crown
their-Kings at pre&s;ent, a day or two after. <HI>Don Lui$ de Arra|gon</HI>
Duke of <HI>Cardonna</HI> and <HI>Segorbe,</HI> the mo&s;t ancient Knight
of the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> Knighted him in the pre&s;ence of &s;everal
Knights of that Order, put on him the Collar of the <HI>Golden
Fleece,</HI> with the u&s;ual Ceremonies; the Princes of <HI>A&s;tiliano
Auclino</HI> and <HI>Montalte,</HI> doing him Homage for <HI>Italy,</HI> Prince of
<HI>Barbancon</HI> for <HI>Flanders,</HI> the Amba&s;&s;adour for <HI>Germany,</HI> and the
Duke of <HI>Cardonna</HI> for <HI>Spain,</HI> he remained under the Tutulage
of his Mother, till the year 1675. when he took on him the
Government; he is an ea&s;ie Man, tall and thin, fair, with the
<HI>Au&s;trian</HI> great under Lip, but of mean Capacity, and not at all
Active; which makes the <HI>Spaniards</HI> often cry out, when &s;hall
we have a King of our own Complexion, they &s;peak very &s;light|ly
of him, as of an Innocent, but yet are very loyal, laying
all the mi&s;carriages in the Government on the Mini&s;ters, who
are changed often enough.</P>
<P>As to the Nobility of this Kingdom, they may be divided
into the higher and lower, the former comprehending only &s;uch
as are <HI>Grandees,</HI> who are covered in Pre&s;ence of the King, they
were &s;o ordered by <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, to avoid the competitions
between the great Men of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> and
in &s;ome &s;ort to make them equal, there are &s;aid to be three
degrees of Preheminence. Herein, the Fir&s;t come into the
Kings pre&s;ence, &s;peak to him covered, and then put on their
Hat; the Second &s;peak to the King, and put not on their Hat;
till the King has &s;poke to them; the Third &s;peak to the King,
and &s;tand by, till the King commands them to cover. The
Names and Titles of the&s;e <HI>Grandees,</HI> follow hereafter, in an
Alphabetical order.</P>

the Poet, <HI>Ian Hidalgo como el Rey y mas Vicio que Vala&s;co,</HI> as much
a Gentleman as the King, and more ancient than <HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> an Hiper|bolical

The fir&s;t Gentleman of the Family of <HI>Vela&s;co;</HI> is the <HI>Marque&s;s

Titles of Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> and <HI>Mendo&s;a,</HI> Duke of <HI>Infantado,</HI>
by that of Admiral of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and &s;everal of the&s;e are united
to other Families. The Lower Nobility of <HI>Spain,</HI> are &s;uch as
though they enjoy the Titles of Dukes, Marque&s;&s;es, Princes,
Earls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet they have not the priviledge of covering in the
King's pre&s;ence, and are called Titles of <HI>Ca&s;tile;</HI> among which
the <HI>Grandees</HI> elde&s;t Sons are chief. The <HI>Grandees</HI> have all the
Style of excellency; but the&s;e only of Lord&s;hip, unle&s;s other|wi&s;e
graduated by Offices or Places; the&s;e Titles are very nu|merous,
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being very Ambitious of Honour, and
by con&s;equence many very poor. A Friend of mine in
<HI>Sevil</HI> told me, that in one Year in that City only, they had
above 30 new Titles of Earls and Marque&s;&s;es, made which
before as he told me (no Comian) did not dine, and I asking
<PB N="292" REF="301">
him what they did now, he made an&s;wer, <HI>que no Cenavan,</HI> (they
did not Sup,) &s;o true it is, they will &s;tarve their own Carca&s;|&s;es
and their Families, for an empty Title, and yet they will
have a Coach and good Cloaths what&s;oever become of the
re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Gentry are as numerous in <HI>Spain,</HI> as in any Country in
the World, and their Families are very ancient, the rea&s;on of
their pre&s;erving them &s;o well, is that all E&s;tates in Land are
$$tailed, and cannot be alienated, but in ca&s;e of failure of
I&s;&s;ue, and that then not without a great deal of charge and
trouble, which is the occa&s;ion that Land is &s;o very dear, there
worth 39 to 40 years purcha&s;e. Al&s;o in every City in the Ar|chives
they keep a regi&s;ter of all the Families that belong there|to
with the Alliances they make, which are al&s;o the more nece&s;|&s;ary,
becau&s;e no one can be made a Knight without full proofs
of his being clear for four Generations, by Father and Mother
of the Blood of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> with whom the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
have been very much mixed in former times, e&s;pecially in <HI>An|dalou&s;ia,</HI>
therefore Men of E&s;tates in <HI>Spain</HI> are extream Am|bitious
of Knighthood, becau&s;e then their Blood is out of que|&s;tion,
and every younger Brother of a good Family, is al&s;o ve|ry
de&s;irous thereof; both becau&s;e that Honour may maintain
him in that re&s;pect in the World, which his want of E&s;tate
would loo&s;e, and al&s;o for that thereby they are capacitated more
readily to obtain Offices and places, Civil and Military. I have
known &s;everal made Knights, that all their E&s;tate and Credit,
would hardly amount to make up 60 Pound, for the charge of
being inve&s;ted therewith, and I remember to have &s;een 14
Knights in the Retinue of the Marque&s;s of <HI>Laguna,</HI> when he
went <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> to <HI>Mexico</HI> in his Livery, &s;o that we may well
put the Knights of <HI>Spain,</HI> into the old Li&s;t of the poor Com|panions.</P>
<P>The orders of Knighthood in <HI>Spain</HI> are the&s;e; (for that of
the <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> nor that of St. <HI>John's</HI> cannot be reckoned <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
Orders; the former being given only to &s;ome very great
Men&punc; and that <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> as well as <HI>Spain,</HI> and is
peculiar to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> as Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and Head
of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the la&s;t is common to all the Papi&s;t
Gentry in <HI>Europe,</HI>) therefore the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Orders are St. <HI>Jago,
Calatrava,</HI> and <HI>Alcantara.</HI> There is hardly any Grandee or
Nobleman in <HI>Spain,</HI> that is not of one of the&s;e Orders, and it
is beneficial as well as honourable; they having many Commenda|ries
belonging to them.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="302">
The Fir&s;t Order of St. <HI>Jago</HI> is the elde&s;t, though not e&s;teemed
the be&s;t, becau&s;e they in producing the proofs of clean Blood,
pardon the quarter part on the Mothers &s;ide which the others
does not. The Habit is a long white Robe, and the Badge is
a red Dagger, which they wear wrought on their Cloaks, and
enameled on a golden Scollop Shell, which Shell you &s;ee St.
<HI>Jagos</HI> Pilgrims wear.</P>
<P>This Order hath 42 Commendaries in the Province of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI>
and 45 in <HI>Leon,</HI> be&s;ides 10 Alcaidies and Lieutenancies.</P>
<P>The Second Order is <HI>Calatrava,</HI> who&s;e Badge is four red
Flower de Luces Cro&s;s wi&s;e. It has 34 Commendaries, and eight
Priories.</P>
<P>The third Order is <HI>Alcantara,</HI> who&s;e Badge is the &s;ame with
<HI>Calatrava</HI> but green. It has 33 Commendaries, four Alcaidies,
four Priories. All the&s;e Orders yields to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the
&s;everal Commendaries, 440000 Ducats Yearly rent, be&s;ides
the Ma&s;ter-&s;hips which are worth 300000 Ducats <HI>per Annum,</HI>
which are at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the King. Tho&s;e Offices by the
Power and influence they have over the Knights of their &s;everal
Orders, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, were thought too great for Subjects to
enjoy as formerly they did over and above the&s;e Rents the &s;everal
Orders allow all their &s;everal Knights, Profe&s;&s;ors, that have not
Commendaries, and that will demand it 120000 Marvedies a
Year for Bread and Water.</P>
