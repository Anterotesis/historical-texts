<LG>
<L>OUR Comic Bard, before who&s;e roving eye</L>
<L>Kingdoms and States in magic vi&s;ion lie,</L>
<L>Sweeps o'er the map, and with a partial &s;mile</L>
<L>Fixes at length on his beloved I&s;le,</L>
<L>He views her deck'd in all her natural charms,</L>
<L>And wrapt in peace, amid&s;t the din of arms.</L>
<L>"Here, here," he cries, "on ALBION's fo&s;tering brea&s;t,</L>
<L>"The Arts are &s;helter'd, and the Mu&s;es re&s;t,</L>
<L>"Here I will build my &s;tage, by moral rule</L>
<L>"And &s;cenic mea&s;ure here erect my &s;chool;</L>
<L>"A &s;chool for prejudice:&mdash;Oh! that my &s;troke</L>
<L>"Cou'd &s;trip that creeper from the Briti&s;h Oak!</L>
<L>"Twin'd round his generous &s;haft, the tangled weed</L>
<L>"Sheds on the undergrowth it's baneful &s;eed."</L>
<L>This &s;aid, he bids us &s;trike the daring blow,</L>
<L>That lays his fame or this defiler low.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now our PROLOGUE &s;peaks&mdash;In former days</L>
<L>Prologues were ab&s;tracts of their &s;everal Plays;</L>
<L>But now, like guilty men, who dread their doom,</L>
<L>We talk of every thing but what's to come.</L>
<L>As for our Fable, little I'll unfold;</L>
<L>For out of little much cannot be told.</L>
<L>'Tis but one &s;pecies in the wide extent</L>
<L>Of prejudice, at which our &s;haft is &s;ent,</L>
<L>'Tis but this &s;imple le&s;&s;on of the heart&mdash;</L>
<L>Judge not the Man by his exterior part:</L>
<L>Virtue's &s;trong root in every &s;oil will grow,</L>
<L>Rich ores lie buried under piles of &s;now.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If to your candour we appeal this night</L>
<L>For a poor Client, for a luckle&s;s Wight,</L>
<L>Whom Bard ne'er favour'd, who&s;e &s;ad fate has been</L>
<L>Never to &s;hare in one applauding &s;cene,</L>
<L>In Souls like your's there &s;hould be found a place</L>
<L>For every Victim of unju&s;t di&s;grace.</L>

<P>WHY do you pre&s;s me for rea&s;ons I'm not bound to give? If I chu&s;e to di&s;mi&s;s an a&s;&s;i&s;tant clerk from my counting-hou&s;e, how does it concern you?</P>

<P>That clerk you took at my recommenda|tion and reque&s;t; I am therefore intere&s;ted to hope you have no rea&s;ons for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him that affect his character.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Step.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am your father, Sir, and in this hou&s;e &s;ole ma&s;ter; I have no partners to account to;

nor will I brook any comments on my conduct from my &s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, as your &s;on, may I not, without ri&s;quing your di&s;plea&s;ure, offer one humble word upon the part of a defencele&s;s ab&s;ent friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Step.</SPEAKER>
<P>A friend!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I hope I need not blu&s;h to call Charles Ratcliffe friend. His virtues, his misfor|tunes, his integrity, (you'll undeceive me if I err) have much endear'd him to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Step.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say rather his connections: Come, I &s;ee where all his friend&s;hip points&mdash;to folly, to di&s;grace&mdash;therefore no more of it! Break off! new friend&s;hips will not co&s;t you dear; 'tis better you &s;hould cea&s;e to call him friend, than put it in his power to call you brother. In one word, Fre|deric, I never will accept of Ratcliffe's &s;i&s;ter as my daughter-in-law&mdash;nor, if I can prevent it, &s;hall you &s;o far forget you&s;elf as to make her your mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<SPEAKER>FREDERIC.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have no choice to make: &s;he is my wife&mdash;and if to take beauty, virtue and elegance without fortune, when my father would have me take fortune without them, is a crime that merits di&s;|inheritance, I mu&s;t meet my puni&s;hment as I can.

<P>You are &s;till a philo&s;opher.</P>

<P>I cannot tell that till I am tried with pro|&s;perity: it is that which &s;ets our failings in full view, adver&s;ity conceals them.&mdash;But come, di&s;cu&s;s: tell me in what one part of my compo&s;ition the ingenious cruelty of Fortune can place another blow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my &s;oul, Charles, I am a&s;ham'd to tell you, becau&s;e the blow is now given by a hand I wi&s;h to reverence. You know the temper of Sir Stephen Bertram: he is my father, therefore I will not enlarge upon a &s;ubject, that would be painful to us both. It is with infinite regret I have &s;een you (nobly de&s;cended, and &s;till more nobly en|dow'd) earning a &s;canty maintenance at your de&s;k in his counting-hou&s;e: It is a &s;lavery you are now releas'd from.</P>

<P>Why, what becomes of all the objects mi&s;ery lays low? they &s;hrink from &s;ight, and are forgotten.&mdash;You know I will not hear you on this &s;ubject: 'twas not with my con&s;ent you ever knew there were &s;uch objects in exi&s;tence.</P>

<P>I $wn it; but in this extremity methinks you might relax a little from that rigid honor.</P>

<P>Never; but as the body of a man is brac'd by winter, &s;o is my re&s;olution by adver&s;ity. On this point only we can differ. Why will my friend per&s;i&s;t in urging it?</P>

<P>The good day to you, my young ma&s;ter! How is it with your health, I pray? Is your fader Sir Stephen Bertram, and my very good patron, to be &s;poken with?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, he is at home, and to be &s;poken with, under &s;ome precaution, Sheva: if you bring him money, you will be welcome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! that is very goot. Monies is wel|come every where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pa&s;s on, pa&s;s on! no more apologies&mdash;Good man of money, &s;ave your breath to count your guineas. <STAGE><HI>[Exit</HI> SHEVA.</STAGE> That fellow wou'd not let his &s;hadow fall upon the earth, if he cou'd help it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too hard upon him. The thing is courteous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hang him! he'll bow for half a crown. His carca&s;e and it's covering wou'd not coin into a ducat, yet he is a moving mine of wealth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;ee the&s;e characters with indignation; I contemplate them with pity. I have a fellow-feel|ing for poor Sheva: he is as much in poverty as I am, only it is poverty of another &s;pecies: He wants what he has, I have nothing and want every thing. Mi&s;ers are not unu&s;eful members of the community; they act like dams to rivers, hold up the &s;tream that el&s;e wou'd run to wa&s;te, and make deep water where there wou'd be &s;hallows.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>I recollect you was his re&s;cuer; I did not know you were his advocate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true I &s;natch'd him out of jeopardy. My countrymen, with all their natural humanity, have no objection to the hu&s;tling of a Jew. The poor old creature was mo&s;t roughly handled.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was the cau&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never a&s;k'd the cau&s;e: There was a hundred
<PB N="6" REF="9">
upon one; that was cau&s;e enough for me to make my&s;elf a &s;econd to the party over-match'd. I got a few hard knocks, but I brought off my man.</P>

<P>Aha! there is no bu&s;ine&s;s to be done; there is no talking to your fader. He is not ju&s;t now in the &s;weete&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible tempers&mdash;Any thing, Mr. Bertram, wanted in my way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sheva, there is enough wanted in your way, but I doubt it is not in your will to do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do always do my utmo&s;t for my princi|pals: I never &s;pare my pains when bu&s;ine&s;s is going; be it ever &s;uch a trifle, I am thankful. Every little helps a poor man like me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;peak of your &s;pirit, I &s;uppo&s;e, when you call your&s;elf a poor man. All the world knows you roll in riches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world knows no great deal of me: I do not deny but my monies may roll a little, but for my&s;elf I do not roll at all. I live &s;paringly and labor hard, therefore I am called a mi&s;er&mdash;I cannot help it&mdash;an uncharitable dog, I mu&s;t endure it&mdash;a blood-&s;ucker, an extortioner, a Shylock&mdash;hard names, Mr. Frederic, but what can a poor Jew &s;ay in return, if a Chri&s;tian chu&s;es to abu&s;e him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say nothing, but &s;pend your money like a Chri&s;tian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have no abiding place on earth, no country, no home: every body rails at us, every body flouts us, every body points us out for their
<PB N="7" REF="10">
may-game and their mockery. If your play|writers want a butt or a buffoon, or a knave to make &s;port of, out comes a Jew to be baited and buffetted through five long acts for the amu&s;ement of all good Chri&s;tians&mdash;Cruel &s;port, mercile&s;s amu&s;e|ment! hard dealings for a poor &s;tray &s;heep of the &s;catter'd flock of Abraham! How can you expect us to &s;hew kindne&s;s, when we receive none?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(advancing)</STAGE>
<P>That is true, friend Sheva, I can witne&s;s; I am &s;orry to &s;ay there is too much ju&s;tice in your complaint.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ble&s;s this goot light! I did not &s;ee you&mdash;'Tis my very good friend Mr. Ratcliffe, as I live. Give me your pardon, I pray you, &s;ir, give me your pardon; I &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ay in your hearing that there is no charity for the poor Jews. Truly, &s;ir, I am under very great obligations to you for your generous protection t'other night, when I was mob'd and mal-treated, and, for aught I can tell, &s;hould have been ma&s;&s;acred, had not you &s;tood for|ward in my defence. Truly, &s;ir, I bear it very thank|fully in my remembrance; truly I do, yes truly.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is &s;o, but your gratitude need not go away at the &s;ame time; you are not bound to make good the proverb<HI>&mdash;"Out of &s;ight, out of mind."</HI></P>

<PB N="8" REF="11">
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no; I am very much oblig'd to him, not only for my life, but for the monies and the valuables I had about me: I had been hu&s;tled out of them all but for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, having &s;o much gratitude for his favours, you have now an opportunity of mak|ing &s;ome return to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, and I do make him a return of my thanks and goot wi&s;hes very heartily. What can a poor Jew &s;ay more? I do wi&s;h him all goot things, and give him all goot words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good words indeed! What are they to a man, who is ca&s;t naked upon the wide world, with a widow'd mother and a defencele&s;s &s;i&s;ter, who look up to him for their &s;upport?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good lack, good lack! I thought he was in occupations in your fader's counting-hou&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was, and from his &s;canty pittance piou&s;ly &s;upported tho&s;e poor de&s;titutes: that &s;ource is now &s;topp'd, and as you, when in the mid&s;t of rioters, was in want of a protector, &s;o is he in the mid&s;t of his misfortunes in want of &s;ome kind friend to re&s;cue him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh dear, oh dear! This world is full of &s;adne&s;s and of &s;orrow; mi&s;eries upon mi&s;eries; unfortunates by hundreds and thou&s;ands, and poor Sheva has but two weak eyes to find tears for them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Sheva, pity will not feed the hungry, nor clothe the naked. Ratcliffe is the friend of my heart: I am helple&s;s in my&s;elf; my father, though ju&s;t, is au&s;tere in the extreme;
<PB N="9" REF="12">
I dare not re&s;ort to him for money, nor can I turn my thoughts to any other quarter for the loan of a &s;mall &s;um in this extremity, except to you.</P>

<P>To me! goot lack, to me! What will be|come of me? what will Sir Stephen &s;ay? He is full of monies; but then again he is a clo&s;e man, very au&s;tere, as you &s;ay, and very ju&s;t, but not very generous.</P>

<P>Well, well, let me have your an&s;wer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, but my an&s;wer will not plea&s;e you without the monies: I &s;hall be a Jewi&s;h dog, a baboon, an imp of Beelzebub, if I don't find the monies; and when my monies is all gone, what &s;hall I be then? An a&s;s, a fool, a jack-a-dandy! Oh dear! oh dear!&mdash;Well, there mu&s;t be conditions, look you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fred.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure: &s;ecurity twice &s;ecur'd; pre|mium and intere&s;t, and bond and judgment into the bargain: only enable me to pre&s;erve my friend, give me that tran&s;ort, and I care not what I pay for it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eliza.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e are fond flattering words; but where's the con&s;olation, that you wou'd have given me had you brought back a pardon from your father? This ardor only proves that you had too much love, and I too little genero&s;ity.</P>

<P>Take courage, Eliza! I have not lo&s;t the field, only prolong'd the fight: I have but &s;kir|mi&s;h'd with him yet; he has not felt my &s;trength.

<P>Well, Saunders, what news have you been able to collect of my undutiful &s;on?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not &s;een Mr. Bertram, but I am told he has &s;ettled him&s;elf in very hand&s;ome lodg|ings, and is gone to remove his lady to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>His lady, do you call her? Can you find no fitter term? Where &s;hou'd he get the means to &s;ettle? He was not furni&s;h'd with them by me; who el&s;e will do it? If he attempts to rai&s;e money upon expectancies, be it at their peril, who are fools enough to tru&s;t him: No prudent man will be his bubble.&mdash;If I were &s;ure that was his practice, I &s;hou'd hold it matter of con&s;cience to adverti&s;e again&s;t his debts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps there may be &s;ome per&s;ons in the world, who think you will not always hold out again&s;t an only &s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;mart for their opinion: they little know the feelings of an injur'd father; they cannot calculate my hopes, my di&s;ap|pointments, my regret. He might have had a lady with an ample fortune: A wi&s;e without a &s;hilling
<PB N="37" REF="40">
is&mdash;but what avails complaint? Cou'd you learn nothing further who &s;upplies him, who holds him up?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hear that he had money of your broker, Sheva.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>That mu&s;t be fal&s;e intelligence. He will as &s;oon make gold by tran&s;mutation, as wring it from the gripe of that old u&s;urer: No, no, Sheva is too wary, too much a Jew to help him with a &s;hilling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet I was &s;o inform'd by his own &s;ervant Jabal. He &s;ays, Mr. Bertram came to old Sheva's hou&s;e by appointment; that he overheard their whole conver&s;ation, in which your &s;on very honorably &s;tated the utter ruin your di&s;plea&s;ure had brought upon him, and wou'd have refus'd the money, but that old Sheva forc'd it upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>It mocks all belief; it only proves that Sheva, the mo&s;t inveterate mi&s;er in exi&s;tence, has a fellow Jew for his &s;ervant, one of the com|plete&s;t liars in creation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am apt to give him credit for the fact, notwith&s;tanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then give me leave to &s;ay you have more faith than mo&s;t men living: was I to give &s;o much credit, Mr. Saunders, I &s;hou'd &s;oon &s;top.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not quite &s;o fixt in my per&s;ua&s;ion of old Sheva's character as you are. In his dealings, all the world knows he is punctiliou&s;ly hone&s;t; no man's character &s;tands higher in the Alley; and his &s;ervant tells me, though he &s;tarves him&s;elf, he is &s;ecretly very charitable to others.</P>

<PB N="38" REF="41">
<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, this you may believe, if you are di&s;|po&s;ed to take one Jew's word for another Jew's character: I am ob&s;tinate again&s;t both; and if he has &s;upplied the money, as I am &s;ure it mu&s;t be on u&s;urious principles, as &s;oon as ever I have the old mi&s;er in my reach I will wring either the truth from his lips, or the life out of his carca&s;e.</P>

<P>The lea&s;t, but luckie&s;t wound that ever man receiv'd: this little glance of your brave hu&s;|band's &s;word di&s;arm'd me of my weapon, and both our ra&s;h hearts of their anger. Now lay a&s;ide your fears, and prepare your&s;elf for wonders.</P>

<P>Ah, Sir, 'tis now too late to cover your good deeds: You have long ma&s;k'd your charities beneath this humble &s;eeming, and &s;hrunk back from actions princes might have gloried in: You mu&s;t now face the world, and transfer the blu&s;h from your own cheeks to their's, whom prejudice had taught to &s;corn you. For your &s;ingle &s;ake we mu&s;t reform our hearts, and in&s;pire them with candor towards your whole nation.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough, Enough! more than enough&mdash;I pray you &s;pare me: I am not u&s;ed to hear the voice of prai&s;e, and it oppre&s;&s;es me: I &s;hou'd not know my&s;elf, if you were to de&s;cribe me; I have a regi&s;ter within, in which the&s;e merits are not

Simply I am an hone&s;t man, no more; fair in my dealings, as my good patron here, I hope, can witne&s;s.&mdash;That lady, I believe, is Mrs. Ratcliffe: She does not know me: I will not touch upon a melancholy &s;ubject, el&s;e I cou'd tell a &s;tory&mdash;Merciful Heaven! what horrors was I &s;natch'd from by her hu&s;band, now, alas! no more!</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! now the my&s;tery's &s;olv'd. The ten thou&s;and pounds were your's.&mdash;Give them to Rat|cliffe; I will have nothing from fortune, where nature gives &s;o much.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sheva.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a noble &s;peech&mdash;but monies does not le&s;&s;en merit, at lea&s;t not always, as I hope, for Mr. Ratcliffe's &s;ake; for he is heir of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>

<P>It is a mine of wealth.</P>

<P>Excu&s;e me, goot Sir Stephen, it is not a mine, for it was never out of &s;ight of tho&s;e who &s;earch'd for it: the poor man did not dig to find it; and where I now be&s;tow it, it will be found by him again. I do not bury it in a &s;ynagogue or any other co&s;tly pile; I do not wa&s;te it upon vanity or public works: I leave it to a charitable heir, and build my ho&s;pital in the human heart.</P>

<L>TRUTH has declar'd, and que&s;tion it none can&punc;</L>
<L>WOMAN was once a rib of Lordly MAN;</L>
<L>And &s;ome perhaps wou'd ri&s;que a little pain</L>
<L>To hitch that rib into its place again;</L>
<L>For let the heart-ache, or what aught betide,</L>
<L>They're &s;ure to trace it to the peccant &s;ide,</L>
<L>Till fixt at length they centre all the blame</L>
<L>In that one rib, from whence the Woman came,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now this is downright prejudice and &s;pleen,</L>
<L>A plea for thru&s;ting us behind the &s;cene;</L>
<L>And there we &s;tood for many a long long age,</L>
<L>Not let to &s;teal one foot upon the Stage,</L>
<L>Till now, when all their tyrant acts are pa&s;t,</L>
<L>Curt&s;ying we come, like EPILOGUE, at la&s;t;</L>
<L>And you &s;o little are inclin'd to rout us,</L>
<L>You wonder how your fathers did without us.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sure we can lightlier touch tho&s;e feeling parts,</L>
<L>That twine about the region of your hearts;</L>
<L>Pa&s;&s;ion, that from the lips of Woman flows,</L>
<L>Warm to Man's &s;oul with magic &s;witne&s;s goes;</L>
<L>And tho' the &s;phere be &s;mall in which we move,</L>
<L>Great is the recompence when you approve.</L>
<L>Whil&s;t Nature and your candour hold their cour&s;e,</L>

<L>Still in the &s;lipp'ry path, that brings us near</L>
<L>Forbidden precincts, we mu&s;t tread with fear,</L>
<L>Does my weak ca&s;t in tragic pathos lie?</L>
<L>Why then &s;o di&s;mal, gentle Poet, why?</L>
<L>In mirth oft' times the nuptial knot I've ty'd,</L>
<L>But never was till now a Mourning Bride.</L>
<L>If to my &s;hare &s;ome moving &s;peeches fall,</L>
<L>"Look in my face, and they'll not move at all."</L>

<L>Yet, not to drop at once ELIZA'S &s;tile,</L>
<L>One word in earne&s;t, and without a &s;mile&mdash;</L>
<L>Thro' all the characters of varied life,</L>
<L>All the fond ca&s;ts of Parent, Child, or Wife,</L>
