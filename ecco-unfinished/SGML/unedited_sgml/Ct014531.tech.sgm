<HEAD>To the Right Honourable
RALPH
Earl of MOUNTAGUE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER>My LORD,</OPENER>
<P>WHether the World will arraign me of Vanity, or not, that
I have pre&s;um'd to Dedicate this Comedy to Your Lord|&s;hip,
I am yet in Doubt: Tho' it may be it is &s;ome de|gree
of Vanity even to doubt of it. One who has at any time had
the Honour of Your Lord&s;hip's Conver&s;ation, cannot be &s;uppos'd
to think very meanly of that which he would prefer to your Pe|ru&s;al:
Yet it were to incur the Imputation of too much Sufficien|cy,
to pretend to &s;uch a Merit as might abide the Te&s;t of Your
Lord&s;hip's Censure.</P>
<P>Whatever Value may be wanting to this Play while yet it is mine,
will be &s;ufficiently made up to it, when it is once become Your
Lord&s;hip's; and it is my Security, that I cannot have over rated
it more by my Dedication, than Your Lord&s;hip will dignifie it by
Your Patronage.</P>
<P>That it &s;ucceeded on the Stage, was almo&s;t beyond my Expe|ctation;
for but little of it was prepar'd for that general Ta&s;t&punc;
which &s;eems now to be predominant in the Pallats of our Audience.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Characters which are meant to be ridicul'd in mo&s;t of
our Comedi$s, are of Fools &s;o gro&s;s, that in my humble Opinion,
they &s;hould rather disturb than divert the well-natur'd and reflect|ing
Part of an Audience; they are rather Objects of Charity th$n
Contempt; and in&s;tead of moving our Mirth, they ought very
often to excite our Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This Reflection mov'd me to de&s;ign &s;ome Characters, which
&s;hould appear ridiculous not &s;o much thro' a natural Folly (which
is incorrigible, and therefore not proper for the Stage) as thro'
an affected Wit; a Wit, which at the &s;ame time that it is affected,
<PB REF="3">
is al&s;o fal&s;e. As there is &s;ome Difficulty in the Formation of a
Character of this Nature, &s;o there is &s;ome Hazard which attends
the Progre&s;s of its Succe&s;s, upon the Stage: For many come to a
Play, &s;o over-charg'd with Critici&s;m, that they very often let fly
their Cen&s;ure, when through their Ra&s;hne&s;s they have mi&s;taken
their Aim. This I had occa&s;ion lately to ob&s;erve: For this Play
had been acted two or three Days, before &s;ome of the&s;e ha&s;ty
Judges cou'd find the lei&s;ure to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the Character
of a <HI>Witwoud</HI> and a <HI>Truewit.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t b$g Your Lord&s;hip's Pardon for this Digre&s;&s;ion from the
true Cour&s;e of this Epi&s;tle; but that it may not &s;eem altogether
impertinent, I beg, that I may plead the Occa&s;ion of it, in part
of that Excu&s;e of which I &s;tand in need, for recommending this
Comedy to Your Protection. It is only by the Countenance of
Your Lord&s;hip, and the <HI>Few</HI> &s;o qualify'd, that &s;uch who write
with Care and Pains can hope to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd: For the Pro&s;ti|tuted
Name of <HI>Poet</HI> promi&s;$uou&s;ly levels all that bear it.</P>
<P><HI>Terence,</HI> the mo&s;t correct Writer in the World, had a <HI>Scipio</HI> and
a <HI>Lelius</HI> if not to a&s;&s;ist him, at lea&s;t to &s;upport him in his Repu|tation:
And notwith&s;tanding his extraordinary Merit, it may be,
their Countenance was not more than nec$&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The Purity of his Stile, the Delicacy of his Turns, and the Ju&s;t|ne&s;s
of his Characters, were all of them Beauties, which the grea|ter
Part of his Audience were incapable of Ta&s;ting: Some of the
cour&s;e&s;t Strokes of <HI>Plautus,</HI> so &s;everely cen&s;ur'd by <HI>Horace,</HI> were
more likely to affect the Multitude; &s;uch, who come with expe|ctation
to laugh out the la&s;t Act of a Play, and are better enter|tain'd
with two or three un&s;ea&s;onable Je&s;ts, than with the artful
Solution of the <HI>Fable.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>Terence</HI> excell'd in his Performances, &s;o had he great Ad|vantages
to encourage his Undertakings; for he built mo&s;t on the
Foundations of <HI>Menander:</HI> His Plots were generally modell'd,
and his Characters ready drawn to his Hand. He copied <HI>Menan|der;</HI>
and <HI>Menander</HI> had no le&s;s Light in the Formation of his
Characters, $rom the Ob&s;ervations of <HI>Theophra&s;tus,</HI> of whom he
was a Di&s;ciple; and <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> it is known was not only the
Di&s;ciple, but the immediate Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> the fir&s;t and
greate&s;t Judge of Poetry. These were great Models to de&s;ign by;
and the further Advantage which <HI>Terence</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, towards giving
his Plays the due Ornaments of Purity of Stile, and Ju&s;tne&s;s of
Manners, was not le&s;s con&s;iderable, from the Freedom of Con|ver&s;ation,
which was permitted him with <HI>Lelius</HI> and <HI>Scipio,</HI> two
<PB REF="4">
of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t polite Men of his Age. And indeed, the
Privilege of &s;uch a Conver&s;ation, is the only certain Means of at|taining
to the Perfection of Dialogue.</P>
<P>If it has happen'd in any Part of this Comedy, that I have gain'd
a Turn of Stile, or Expre&s;&s;ion more Correct, or at lea&s;t more Cor|rigible
than in tho&s;e which I have formerly written, I mu&s;t, with
equal Pride an $ Gratitude, a&s;cribe it to the Honour of Your
Lord&s;hip's admitting me into Your Conver&s;ation, and that of a
Society where every body el&s;e was &s;o well worthy of You, in
Your Retirement la&s;t Summer from the Town: For it was imme|diately
after, that this Comedy was written. If I have fail'd in
my Performance, it is only to be regretted, where there were &s;o
many, not inferior either to a <HI>Scipio</HI> or a <HI>Lelius,</HI> that there &s;hou'd
be one wanting equal to the Capacity of a <HI>Terence.</HI>
If I am not mi&s;taken, Poetry is almo&s;t the only Art, which has
not yet laid Claim to Your Lord&s;hip's Patronage. Architecture,
and Painting, to the great Honour of our Country, have flouri&s;h'd
under Your Influence and Protection. In the mean time, Poetry,
the elde&s;t Si&s;ter of all Arts, and Parent of mo&s;t, &s;eems to have re|&s;ign'd
her Birth-right, by having neglected to pay her Duty to
Your Lord&s;hip; and by permitting others of a later Extraction,
to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s that Place in Your E&s;teem, to which none can pre|tend
a better Title. Poetry, in its Nature, is &s;acred to the Good
and Great; the Relation between them is reciprocal, and they are
ever propitious to it. It is the Privilege of Poetry to addre&s;s to
them, and it is their Pr$rogative alone to give it Protection.</P>
<P>This receiv'd Maxim, is a general Apology for all Writers who
Con&s;ecrate their Labours to great Men: But I could wi&s;h at this
time, that this Addre&s;s were exempted from the common Pretence
of all Dedications; and that as I can di&s;tingui&s;h Your Lord&s;hip
even among the mo&s;t De&s;erving, &s;o this Offering might become
remarkable by &s;ome particular In&s;tance of Re&s;pect, which &s;hou'd
a&s;&s;ure Your Lord&s;hip, that I am, with all due &s;en&s;e of Your ex|tream
Worthine&s;s and Humanity,</P>

and mo&s;t Oblig'd Humble Servant,

<HEAD>EPILOGUE,
Spoken by Mrs. Bracegirdle.</HEAD>
<L>After our <HI>Epilogue</HI> this Crowd di&s;mi&s;&s;es,</L>
<L>I'm thinking how this Play'll be pull'd to Pieces.</L>
<L>But pray con&s;ider, e'er you doom its Fall,</L>
<L>How hard a thing 'twould be, to plea&s;e you all.</L>
<L>There are &s;ome Criticks &s;o with Spleen di&s;eas'd,</L>
<L>They &s;carcely come inclining to be Pleas'd:</L>
<L>And &s;ure he mu&s;t have more than mortal Skill,</L>
<L>Who plea&s;es any one again&s;t his Will.</L>
<L>Then, all bad Poets we are &s;ure are Foes,</L>
<L>And how their Number's &s;well'd the Town well knows:</L>
<L>In &s;hoals, I've mark'd 'em judging in the Pit;</L>
<L>Tho' they're on no Pretence for Judgment fit</L>
<L>But that they have been Damn'd for Want of Wit.</L>
<L>Since when, they by their own Offences taught</L>
<L>Set up for Spies on Plays, and finding Fault.</L>
<L>Others there are who&s;e Malice we'd prevent;</L>
<L>Such, who watch Plays, with &s;currilous Intent</L>
<L>To mark out who by Characters are meant.</L>
<L>And tho' no perfect Likene&s;s they can trace;</L>
<L>yet each pretends to know the <HI>Copy'd Face.</HI></L>
<L>These, with fal&s;e Glo&s;&s;es feed their own Ill-nature,</L>
<L>And turn to <HI>Libel;</HI> what was meant a Satire.</L>
<L>May &s;uch malicious Fops this Fortune find,</L>
<L>To think them&s;elves alone the <HI>Fools</HI> de&s;ign'd:</L>
<L>If any are &s;o arrogantly Vain,</L>
<L>To think they &s;ingly can &s;upport a Scene,</L>
<L>And furni&s;h <HI>Fool</HI> enough to entertain.</L>
<L>For well the Learn'd and the Judicious know,</L>
<L>That Satire &s;corns to &s;toop &s;o meanly low,</L>
<L>$s any <HI>one ab&s;tracted Fop</HI> to &s;how.</L>
<L>For, as when Painters form a matchle&s;s Face,</L>
<L>They from each Fair One catch &s;ome diff'rent Grace&punc;</L>
<L>$word$ &s;hining Features in one Portrait blend,</L>
<L>To which no &s;ingle Beauty mu&s;t pretend:</L>
<L>So Poets oft, do in one Piece expo&s;e</L>
<L>$word$ $elles A&s;&s;embles of <HI>Co$que$s</HI> and <HI>Beaux.</HI></L>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,
Spoken by Mr. Betterton.</HEAD>
<L>OF tho&s;e jew Fools, who with ill Stars are curs'd,</L>
<L>Sure &s;cribbing Fools, call'd Poets, fare the wor&s;t.</L>
<L>For they're a &s;ort of Fools which <HI>Fortune</HI> makes,</L>
<L>And after &s;he $as made '$m Fools, for &s;akes.</L>
<L>With Nature's Oafs 'tis quite a diff'rent Ca&s;e,</L>
<L>For <HI>Fortune</HI> favours all her <HI>Idiot-Race:</HI></L>
<L>In her own Ne&s;t the <HI>Cuckow-Eggs</HI> we find,</L>
<L>O'er which &s;he broods to hatch the <HI>Changling-Kind.</HI></L>
<L>No Portion for her own &s;he has to &s;pare,</L>
<L>So much &s;he doats on her adopted Care.</L>
<L>Poets are Bubbles, by the Town drawn in,</L>
<L>Suffer'd at fir&s;t &s;ome trifling Stakes to win:</L>
<L>But what unequal Hazards do they run!</L>
<L>Each time they write, they venture all they've won:</L>
<L>The 'Squire that's butter'd &s;till, is &s;ure to be undone.</L>
<L>This Author, heretofore, has found your Favour,</L>
<L>But pleads no Merit from his pa&s;t Behaviour.</L>
<L>To build on that might prove a vain Pre&s;umption,</L>
<L>Should <HI>Grants</HI> to Poets made, admit Re&s;umption:</L>
<L>And in <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> he mu&s;t lo&s;e his Seat,</L>
<L>If that be found a forfeited E&s;tate.</L>
<L>He owns, with Toil, be wrought the following Scenes,</L>
<L>But if they're naught ne'er &s;pare him for his Pains:</L>
<L>Damn him the mare; have no Co$$$$&s;eration</L>
<L>For Dulne&s;s on mature Deliberation.</L>
<L>He &s;wears he'll not re&s;ent one hi&s;s'd-off Scene,</L>
<L>Nor, like tho&s;e peevi&s;h Wits, his Play maintain,</L>
<L>Who, to a&s;ert their Sen&s;e, your Ta&s;te arraign.</L>
<L>Some Plot we think he has, and &s;ome new Thought;</L>
<L>Some Humour too, no Farce; but that's a Fault.</L>
<L>Satire, he thinks, you aught not to expect,</L>
<L>For so Reform'd a Town, who dares Correct?</L>
<L>To Plea&s;e, this time, has been his &s;ole Pretence,</L>
<L>He'll not in&s;truct, l$&s;t it &s;hould give Offence.</L>
<L>Should he by chance a Knave or Fool expo&s;e,</L>
<L>That hurts none here, sure here are none of tho&s;e.</L>
<L>In &s;hort, our Play, &s;hall (with your leave to &s;hew it)</L>
<L>Give you one In&s;tance of a Pa&s;&s;ive Poet.</L>
<L>Who to your Judgments yields all Re&s;ignation;</L>
<L>So Save or Damn, after your own Di&s;cretion.</L>

was guilty of a Song in her Commendation: Nay, I got a Friend
to put her into a Lampoon, and complement her with the Impu|tation
of an Affair with a young Fellow, which I carry'd &s;o far,
that I told her the malicious Town took notice that &s;he was grown
fat of a &s;udden; and when &s;he lay in of a Drop&s;ie, per&s;uaded her
&s;he was reported to be in Labour. The Devil's in't, if an old Wo|man
is to be flatter'd further, unle&s;s a Man &s;hou'd endeavour
downright per&s;onally to debauch her; and that my Virtue forbad
me. But for the Di&s;covery of this Amour, I am indebted to your

<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was always civil to me, till of late; I confe&s;s I am

her; and tho&s;e Affectations which in another Woman wou'd be o|dious,
&s;erve but to make her more agreeable. I'll tell thee, <HI>Fain|all,</HI>
&s;he once us'd me with that In&s;olence, that in Revenge I took
her to pieces; &s;ifted her and &s;eparated her Failings; I &s;tudy'd 'em,

not without Hopes, one Day or other to hate her heartily: To

who&s;e Conver&s;ation can never be approv'd, yet it is now and
then to be endur'd. He has indeed one good Quality, he is not
Exceptious; for he so pa&s;&s;ionately affects the Reputation of un|der&s;tanding

Enter Mrs. <HI>Fainall</HI> and Mrs. Marwood.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, dear <HI>Marwood,</HI> if we will be happy,
we mu&s;t find the Means in our &s;elves, and a|mong
our &s;elves. Men are ever in Extreams, either do$ting or
aver&s;e. While they are Lovers, if they have Fire and Sen&s;e, their
Jealou&s;ies are in&s;upportable: And when they cea&s;e to Love, (we
ought to think at lea&s;t) they loath; they look upon us with Hor|ror
and Di&s;ta&s;te; they meet us like the Gho&s;ts of what we were,
and as &s;uch fly from us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, 'tis an unhappy Circum&s;tance of Life, that
Love &s;hou'd ever die before us; and that the Man &s;o often &s;hou'd
out-live the Lover. But &s;ay what you will, 'tis better to be left,
than never to have been lov'd. To pa&s;s our Youth in dull In|difference,
to refu&s;e the Sweets of Life becau&s;e they once mu&s;t
leave us; is as prepo&s;terous, as to wi&s;h to have been born Old,
becau&s;e we one Day mu&s;t be Old. For my part, my Youth may
wear and wa&s;te, but it &s;hall never ru&s;t in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it &s;eems you di&s;&s;emble an Aver&s;ion to Man|kind,
only in compliance with my Mother's Humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly. To be free; I have no Ta&s;te of tho&s;e
in&s;ipid dry Di&s;cour&s;es, with which our Sex of force mu&s;t enter|tain
them&s;elves, apart from Men. We may affect Endearments
to each other, profe&s;s eternal Friend&s;hips, and &s;eem to dote like
Lovers; but 'tis not in our Natures long to per&s;evere. Love will
re&s;ume his Empire in our Brea&s;ts, and every Heart, or &s;oon or
late, receive and readmit him as its lawful Tyrant.</P>

<P>To let you know I &s;ee through all your little Arts&mdash;
Come, you both love him; and both have equally di&s;&s;embl'd your

<P>And wherefore do you hate him? He is in&s;en&s;ible, and
your Re&s;entment follows his Neglect. An In&s;tance? The Injuries
you have done him are a Proof: Your interpo&s;ing in his Love.
What cau&s;e had you to make Di&s;coveries of his pretended Pa&s;|&s;ion?
To undeceive the credlous Aunt, and be the officious Ob|&s;tacle

<P>Shame and Ingratitude! Do you reproach me? You,
you upbraid me! Have I been fal&s;e to her, thro' &s;trict Fidelity to
you, and &s;acrific'd my Friend&s;hip to keep my Love inviolate?
And have you the Ba&s;ene&s;s to charge me with the Guilt, unmind|ful
of the Merit! To you it &s;hou'd be meritorious, that I have

been vicious. And do you reflect that Guilt upon me, which
&s;hould lie buried in your Bo&s;om?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You mi&s;interpret my Reproof. I meant but to remind

<P>You have been the Cau&s;e that I have lov'd with|out

</SP>
<PB N="19" REF="26">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mira.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do we daily commit di&s;agreeable and dangerous A|ctions?
To &s;ave that Idol Reputation. If the Familiarities of our
Loves had produc'd that Con&s;equence, of which you were ap|prehen&s;ive,
where could you have fix'd a Father's Name with Cre|dit,
but on a Husband? I knew <HI>Fainall</HI> to be a Man lavi&s;h of his
Morals, an intere&s;ted and profe&s;&s;ing Freind, a fal&s;e and a de&s;ign|ing
Lover; yet one who&s;e Wit and outward fair Behaviour, have
gain'd a Reputation with the Town, enough to make that Wo|man
&s;tand excus'd, who has &s;uffer'd her &s;el$ to be won by his Ad|dre&s;&s;es.
A better Man ought not to have been &s;acrific'd to the

Your Gla&s;s is all a Cheat. The Ugly and the Old, whom the
