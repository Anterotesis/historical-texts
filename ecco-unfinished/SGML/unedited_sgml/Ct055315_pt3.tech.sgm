<P>&sect; I. A Congre&s;s had been opened at Niemerow in
Poland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1737.</NOTE> to compromi&s;e the differences between
the Czarina and the Grand-Signor: but this proving in|effectual,
the Emperor declared war again&s;t the Turks,
and demanded a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the diet of the empire. He
concerted the operations of the campaign with the Empre&s;s
of Mu&s;covy. It was agreed, that the Imperiali&s;ts, under
Count Seckendorf, &s;hould attack Widin in Servia, while
the Ru&s;&s;ians, commanded by Count de Munich, &s;hould
penetrate to the Ukraine, and be&s;iege Oezakow, on the
Bori&s;thenes. They accordingly advanced again&s;t this
place, which was garri&s;oned by twenty thou&s;and men;
and on the &s;ide of the Bori&s;thenes defended by eighteen
<PB N="3" REF="5">
gallies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1737.</NOTE> The Mu&s;covites carried on their approaches
with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity and per&s;everance, that the Turks
were terrified at their valour, and in a few days capitulated.
Among tho&s;e who &s;ignali&s;ed them&s;elves by uncommon
marks of prowe&s;s in the&s;e attacks, was General Keith,
now field-mar&s;hal in the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;ervice, who was dan|gerou&s;ly
wounded on this occa&s;ion. Mean while Count
Seckendorf, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to reduce Widin without
a &s;quadron of &s;hips on the Danube, turned his arms again&s;t
Ni&s;&s;a, which was &s;urrendered to him on the eight-and-twentieth
day of July: but this was the farthe&s;t verge of
his good fortune. The Turks attacked the po&s;ts which
the Imperiali&s;ts occupied along the Danube. They took
the fort of Padudil, burned the town of Ilas in Walachia,
and plundered the neighbouring villages. The Prince of
Saxe-Hildburghau&s;en, who had inve&s;ted Bagnalack in
Bo&s;nia, was defeated, and obliged to repa&s;s the Saave.
Count Seckendorf was recalled to Vienna; and the com|mand
of the army devolved upon Count Philippi. Count
Kevenhuller was obliged to retreat from Servia; and
Ni&s;&s;a was retaken by the Mu&s;&s;ulmen. The conferences
at Niemerow were broken off; and the Turki&s;h pleni|potentiaries
returned to Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>&sect; II. The kingdom of Poland now enjoyed the mo&s;t
perfect repo&s;e under the dominion of Augu&s;tus. Ferdi|nand,
the old Duke of Courland, dying without i&s;&s;ue,
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was di&s;puted by the Teutonick order and
the kingdom of Poland, while the &s;tates of Courland
claimed a right of election, and &s;ent deputies to Peter|&s;burgh,
imploring the protection of the Czarina. A body
of Ru&s;&s;ian troops immediately entered that country: and
the &s;tates elected the Count de Biron, high chamberlain to
the Empre&s;s of Mu&s;covy. The elector of Cologn, as
grand-ma&s;ter of the Teutonick-order, prote&s;ted again&s;t
this election; but the King of Poland agreed to it, on
certain conditions &s;ettled at Dantzick with the com|mi&s;&s;aries
of the new Duke and tho&s;e of the Czarina. In
the month of July, John Ga&s;ton de Medicis, Great Duke
<PB N="4" REF="6">
of Tu&s;cany, died at Florence; and the Prince de Craon
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his territories, in the name of the Duke
of Lorraine, to whom the Emperor had already granted
the eventual inve&s;titure of that duchy.</P>
<P>&sect; III. In England the attention of the publick was at|tracted
by an open breach in the royal family. The Prin|ce&s;s
of Wales had advanced to the very la&s;t month of her
pregnancy before the King and Queen were informed of
her being with child. She was twice conveyed from
Hampton-court to the palace of St. James's, when her
labour pains were &s;uppo&s;ed to be approaching; and at
length was delivered of a prince&s;s in about two hours after
her arrival. The King being appri&s;ed of this event, &s;ent
a me&s;&s;age by the Earl of E&s;&s;ex to the Prince, expre&s;&s;ing
his di&s;plea&s;ure at the conduct of his royal highne&s;s, as an
indignity offered to him&s;elf and the Queen. The Prince
deprecated his Maje&s;ty's anger in &s;everal &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letters,
and implored the Queen's mediation. The Prince&s;s
joined her entreaties to tho&s;e of his royal highne&s;s: but all
their humility and &s;upplication proved ineffectual. The
King, in another me&s;&s;age &s;ent by the Duke of Grafton,
ob&s;erved, that the Prince had removed the Prince&s;s twice
in the week immediately preceding the day of her delivery
from the place of his Maje&s;ty's re&s;idence, in expectation
of her labour; and both times, on his return, indu&s;triou&s;ly
concealed from the knowledge of the King and Queen
every circum&s;tance relating to this important affair: that
at la&s;t, without giving any notice to their Maje&s;ties, he
had precipitately hurried the Prince&s;s from Hampton-court
in a condition not to be named: that the whole te|nour
of his conduct, for a con&s;iderable time, had been &s;o
entirely void of all real duty to the King, that his Maje&s;ty
had rea&s;on to be highly offended with him. He gave him
to under&s;tand, that until he &s;hould withdraw his regard
and confidence from tho&s;e by who&s;e in&s;tigation and advice
he was directed and encouraged in his unwarrantable be|haviour
to his Maje&s;ty and the Queen, and return to his
duty, he &s;hould not re&s;ide in the palace; he, therefore,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
&s;ignified his plea&s;ure that he &s;hould leave St. James's,
with all his family, when it could be done without pre|judice
or inconvenience to the Prince&s;s. In obedience to
this order, the Prince retired to Kew, and made other
efforts to be readmitted into his Maje&s;ty's favour, which,
however, he could not retrieve. Whatever might have
been his de&s;ign in concealing &s;o long from the King and
Queen the pregnancy of the Prince&s;s, and afterwards hur|rying
her from place to place in &s;uch a condition, to the
manife&s;t hazard of her life, his Maje&s;ty had certainly
cau&s;e to be offended at this part of his conduct: though
the puni&s;hment &s;eems to have been &s;evere, if not rigorous;
for he was not even admitted into the pre&s;ence of the
Queen his mother, to expre&s;s his duty to her, in her la&s;t
moments, to implore her forgivene&s;s, and receive her la&s;t
ble&s;&s;ing. She died of a mortification in her bowels, on
the twentieth day of November, in the fifty-fifth year of
her age, regretted as a prince&s;s of uncommon &s;agacity,
and as a pattern of conjugal virtue.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. The King opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament on
the twenty-fourth day of January, with a &s;hort &s;peech,
recommending the di&s;patch of the publick bu&s;ine&s;s with
prudence and unanimity. Each Hou&s;e pre&s;ented a warm
addre&s;s of condolance on the Queen's death, with which
he &s;eemed to be extremely affected. Though the Hou&s;e
of Commons unanimou&s;ly &s;ympathi&s;ed with the King in
his affliction, the mini&s;ter &s;till met with contradiction in
&s;ome of his favourite mea&s;ures. One would imagine that
all the arguments for and again&s;t a &s;tanding army in time
of peace had been already exhau&s;ted; but, when it was
moved that the &s;ame number of land-forces which they had
voted in the preceding year &s;hould be continued in pay
for the en&s;uing year, the di&s;pute was renewed with &s;ur|pri&s;ing
vivacity, and produced &s;ome rea&s;ons which had not
been &s;ugge&s;ted before. The adherents of the mini&s;ter
fairly owned that if the army &s;hould be di&s;banded, or even
con&s;iderably reduced, they believed the Tory intere&s;t would
prevail; that the pre&s;ent number of forces was ab&s;olutely
<PB N="6" REF="8">
nece&s;&s;ary to maintain the peace of the kingdom, which
was filled with clamour and di&s;content, as well as to &s;up|port
the Whig intere&s;t; and that they would vote for
keeping up four times the number, &s;hould it be found ex|pedient
for that purpo&s;e. The members in the oppo&s;ition
replied, that this declaration was a &s;evere &s;atire on the
mini&s;try, who&s;e conduct had given birth to &s;uch a &s;pirit of
di&s;content. They &s;aid it was in effect a tacit acknow|ledgement,
that what they called the Whig intere&s;t was no
more than an incon&s;iderable party, which had engro&s;&s;ed the
admini&s;tration by indirect methods; which acted contrary
to the &s;en&s;e of the nation; and depended for &s;upport upon a
military power, by which the people in general were over|awed,
and con&s;equently en&s;laved. They affirmed, that
the di&s;content of which the mini&s;try complained was in
a great mea&s;ure owing to that very &s;tanding army, which
perpetuated their taxes, and hung over their heads, as the
in&s;truments of arbitrary power and oppre&s;&s;ion. Lord
Polworth explained the nature of Whig principles, and
demon&s;trated that the party which di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf
by this appellation no longer retained the maxims by
which the Whigs were originally characteri&s;ed. Sir John
Hynde Cotton, who &s;poke with the courage and freedom
of an old Engli&s;h baron, declared he never knew a member
of that Hou&s;e who acted on true Whig principles vote for a
&s;tanding army in time of peace. &startq;I have heard of Whigs
(&s;aid he) who oppo&s;ed all unlimited votes of credit: I
have heard of Whigs who looked upon corruption as the
greate&s;t cur&s;e that could befall any nation: I have
heard of Whigs who e&s;teemed the liberty of the pre&s;s
to be the mo&s;t valuable privilege of a free people,
and triennial parliaments as the greate&s;t bulwark of
their liberties; and I have heard of a Whig admini&s;tra|tion
which has re&s;ented injuries done to the trade of the
nation, and revenged in&s;ults offered to the Briti&s;h
flag.&endq;&mdash;The mini&s;try triumphed as u&s;ual, and the
&s;ame number of forces was continued.</P>
<P>&sect; V. Ever &s;ince the treaty of Seville, the Spaniards in
America had almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly in&s;ulted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="7" REF="9">
commerce of Great-Britain. They di&s;puted the right of
Engli&s;h traders to cut logwood in the bay of Campeachy,
and gather &s;alt on the i&s;land of Tortugas; though that
right was acknowledged by implication in all the treaties
which had been lately concluded between the two nations.
The captains of their armed ve&s;&s;els, known by the name
of guarda-co&s;tas, had made a practice of boarding and plun|dering
Briti&s;h &s;hips, on pretence of &s;earching for contra|band
commodities, on which occa&s;ions they had be|haved
with the utmo&s;t in&s;olence, cruelty, and rapine.
Some of their &s;hips of war had actually attacked a fleet of
Engli&s;h merchant-&s;hip at the i&s;land of Tortugas, as if
they had been at open enmity with England. They had
&s;ei&s;ed and detained a great number of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, impri|&s;oned
their crews and confi&s;cated their cargoes in violation
of treaties, in defiance of common ju&s;tice and humanity.
Repeated memorials were pre&s;ented to the court of Spain,
by the Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Madrid. He was amu&s;ed
with eva&s;ive an&s;wers, vague promi&s;es of enquiry, and ce|dulas
of in&s;tructions &s;ent to the Spani&s;h governors in
America, to which they paid no &s;ort of regard. Not but
that the Spaniards had rea&s;on to complain, in their turn,
of the illicit commerce which the Engli&s;h traders from
Jamaica and other i&s;lands carried on with their &s;ubjects
on the continent of South-America; though this could
not ju&s;tify the depredations and cruelties which the com|manders
of the guarda-co&s;tas had committed, without
provocation or pretence.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. The merchants of England loudly complained
of the&s;e outrages: the nation was fired with re&s;entment,
and cried for vengeance; but the mini&s;ter appeared cold,
phlegmatick, and timorous. He knew that a war would
involve him in &s;uch difficulties as mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity en|danger
his admini&s;tration. The trea&s;ure which he now
employed for dome&s;tick purpo&s;es mu&s;t in that ca&s;e be
expended in military armaments: the wheels of that ma|chine
on which he had rai&s;ed his influence would no
longer move: the oppo&s;ition would of con&s;equence gain

<PB N="7" REF="11">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="8" REF="12">
ground, and the impo&s;ition of fre&s;h taxes, nece&s;&s;ary for
the maintenance of the war, would fill up the mea&s;ure
of popular re&s;entment again&s;t his per&s;on and mini&s;try.
Moved by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he indu&s;triou&s;ly endeavour|ed
to avoid a rupture, and to obtain &s;ome &s;ort of &s;atisfaction
by dint of memorials and negociations, in which he be|trayed
his own fears to &s;uch a degree as animated the Spa|niards
to per&s;i&s;t in their depredations, and encouraged the
court of Madrid to di&s;regard the remon&s;trances of the Bri|ti&s;h
amba&s;&s;ador. But his apprehen&s;ions of war did not pro|ceed
from Spain only: the two branches of the hou&s;ee of
Bourbon were now united by politicks, as well as by con&s;an|guinity;
and he did not doubt, that, in ca&s;e of a rupture
with Spain, they would join their forces again&s;t Great-Bri|tain.
Petitions were delivered to the Hou&s;e by merchants
from different parts of the kingdom, explaining the re|peated
violences to which they had been expo&s;ed, and im|ploring
relief of the parliament. The&s;e were referred to
a committee of the whole Hou&s;e; and an order was made to
admit the petitioners, if they &s;hould think fit to be heard
by them&s;elves or by coun&s;el. Sir John Barnard moved for
an addre&s;s to the King, that all the memorials and papers
relating to the Spani&s;h depredations &s;hould be laid before
the Hou&s;e; and this, with &s;ome alteration propo&s;ed by
Sir Robert Walpole, was actually pre&s;ented. In compli|ance
with the reque&s;t, an enormous multitude of letters
and memorials was produced.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The Hou&s;e, in a grand committee, proceeded
to hear coun&s;el for the merchants, and examine evidence;
by which it appeared that amazing acts of wanton cruelty
and inju&s;tice had been perpetrated by Spaniards on the
&s;ubjects of Great-Britain. Mr. Pulteney expatiated upon
the&s;e circum&s;tances of barbarity. He demon&s;trated, from
treaties, the right of the Briti&s;h traders to the logwood
of Campeachy, and to the &s;alt of Tortugas: he expo&s;ed
the pu&s;illanimity of the mini&s;ter, and the futility of his
negociations: he moved for &s;uch re&s;olutions as would
<PB N="9" REF="13">
evince the re&s;entment of an injured nation, and the
vigour of a Briti&s;h parliament. The&s;e were warmly
combated by Sir Robert Walpole, who affirmed they
would cramp the mini&s;ters in their endeavours to com|promi&s;e
the&s;e differences: that they would fru&s;trate their
negociations, entrench upon the King's prerogative, and
precipitate the nation into an unnece&s;&s;ary and expen&s;ive
war. An&s;wers produced replies, and a general debate
en&s;ued. A re&s;olution was reported; but the que&s;tion be|ing
put for recommitting it, was carried in the negative.
The Hou&s;e, however, agreed to an addre&s;s, be&s;eeching
his Maje&s;ty to u&s;e his endeavours to obtain effectual re|lief
for his injured &s;ubjects, to convince the court of
Spain that his Maje&s;ty could no longer &s;uffer &s;uch con|&s;tant
and repeated in&s;ults and injuries to be carried on, to
the di&s;honour of his crown, and to the ruin of his trading
&s;ubjects; and a&s;&s;uring him, that in ca&s;e his royal and
friendly in&s;tances with the Catholick King, &s;hould mi&s;|carry,
the Hou&s; would effectually &s;upport his Maje&s;ty in
taking &s;uch mea&s;ures as honour and ju&s;tice &s;hould make it
nece&s;&s;ary for him to pur&s;ue. To this addre&s;s the King
made a favourable an&s;wer.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The next important &s;ubject on which both &s;ides
exerci&s;ed their talents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1738.</NOTE> was a bill prepared and brought in
by Mr. Pulteney, for the more effectual &s;ecuring the
trade of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in America. This was no
other than the revival of part of two acts pa&s;&s;ed in the
reign of Queen Anne, by which the property of all prizes
taken from the enemy was ve&s;ted in the captors: while the
&s;overeign was empowered to grant commi&s;&s;ions or charters
to any per&s;ons or &s;ocieties, for taking any &s;hips, goods,
harbours, lands, or fortifications of the nation's enemies
in America, and for holding and enjoying the &s;ame as
their own property and e&s;tate for ever. The mini&s;try
endeavoured to evade the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this bill, by amu|&s;ing
the Hou&s;e with other bu&s;ine&s;s, until an end &s;hould be
put to the &s;e&s;&s;ion. A mean artifice was practi&s;ed with
<PB N="10" REF="14">
this view;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1738.</NOTE> and &s;ome &s;evere altercation pa&s;&s;ed between Sir
Robert Walpole and Mr. Pulteney. At length the bill
was read, and gave ri&s;e to a very long and warm conte&s;t,
in which the greate&s;t orators of both &s;ides found oppor|tunities
to di&s;play their eloquence and &s;atire. Mr.
Pulteney defended the bill with all the ardour of paternal
affection; but, notwith&s;tanding his warme&s;t endeavours,
it was rejected upon a divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. When the mutiny-bill was &s;ent up to the Hou&s;e
of Lords, a long debate aro&s;e upon the number of troops
voted for the en&s;uing year. Lord Carteret explained the
&s;ituation of affairs in almo&s;t every nation of Europe, with
great conci&s;ene&s;s and preci&s;ion. He demon&s;trated the im|probability
of a rupture between Great Britain and any
power again&s;t which a land-army could be of any &s;ervice.
He examined the dome&s;tick circum&s;tances of the nation;
and proved, that whatever di&s;contents there might be in
the kingdom, there was little or no di&s;affection, and no
&s;eeming de&s;ign to overturn or di&s;turb the government. In
an&s;wer to an argument, that &s;uch a number of regular
forces was nece&s;&s;ary for preventing or quelling tumults,
and for enabling the civil magi&s;trate to execute the laws
of his country, he expre&s;&s;ed his hope that he &s;hould never
&s;ee the nation reduced to &s;uch unfortunate circum&s;tances:
he &s;aid a law which the civil power was unable to execute
mu&s;t either be in it&s;elf oppre&s;&s;ive, or &s;uch a one as afforded
a handle for oppre&s;&s;ion. In arguing for a reduction of the
forces, he took notice of the great increa&s;e of the national
expen&s;e. He ob&s;erved, that before the Revolution, the
people of England did not rai&s;e above two millions for the
whole of the publick charge; but now what was called
the current expen&s;e, for which the parliament annually
provided, exceeded that &s;um, be&s;ides the civil li&s;t, the in|tere&s;t
due to the publick creditors, and the &s;inking-fund,
which added together, compo&s;ed a burthen of &s;ix millions
yearly. The Earl of Che&s;terfield, on the &s;ame &s;ubject,
affirmed that &s;lavery and arbitrary power were the certain
<PB N="11" REF="15">
con&s;equences of keeping up a &s;tanding army for any num|ber
of years.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1738.</NOTE> It is the machine by which the chains of
&s;lavery are rivetted upon a free people. They may be
&s;ecretly prepared by corruption; but, unle&s;s a &s;tanding
army protected tho&s;e that forged them, the people would
break them a&s;under, and chop off the polluted hands by
which they were prepared. By degrees a free people mu&s;t
be accu&s;tomed to be governed by an army: by degrees
that army mu&s;t be made &s;trong enough to hold them in
&s;ubjection. England had for many years been accu&s;tom|ed
to a &s;tanding army, under pretence of its being ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to a&s;&s;i&s;t the civil power; and by degrees the num|ber
and &s;trength of it have been increa&s;ing. At the ac|ce&s;&s;ion
of the late King it did not exceed &s;ix thou&s;and: it
&s;oon amounted to double that number, which has been
&s;ince augmented under various pretences. He, therefore,
concluded, that &s;lavery, under the di&s;gui&s;e of an army for
protecting the liberties of the people, was creeping in
upon them by degrees: if no reduction &s;hould be made,
he declared he &s;hould expect in a few years to hear &s;ome
mini&s;ter, or favourite of a mini&s;ter, terrifying the Hou&s;e
with imaginary plots and inva&s;ions, and making the tour
of Europe in &s;earch of po&s;&s;ible dangers, to &s;how the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of keeping up a mercenary &s;tanding army three
times as numerous as the pre&s;ent. In &s;pite of the&s;e &s;ug|ge&s;tions,
the &s;tanding army maintained its ground. The
&s;ame noblemen, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Lord Bathur&s;t, di&s;tingui&s;hed
them&s;elves in a debate upon the Spani&s;h depredations,
which comprehended the &s;ame arguments that were u&s;ed
in the Hou&s;e of Commons. They met with the &s;ame
&s;ucce&s;s in both. Re&s;olutions equivalent to tho&s;e of the
Lower Hou&s;e were taken: an addre&s;s was pre&s;ented;
and his Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;ured them he would repeat, in the
mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing manner, his in&s;tances at the court of Spain,
in order to obtain &s;atisfaction and &s;ecurity for his &s;ubjects
trading to America. This a&s;&s;urance was renewed in his
&s;peech at the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, on the twentieth of May,
when the parliament was prorogued.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="16">
&sect; X. At this period the Prince&s;s of Wales was delivered
of a &s;on, who was bapti&s;ed by the name of George, now
King of Great-Britain. His birth was celebrated with
uncommon rejoicings: addre&s;&s;es of congratulation were
pre&s;ented to the King by the two univer&s;ities, and by
almo&s;t all the cities and communities of the kingdom.
But the Prince of Wales &s;till laboured under the di&s;plea|&s;ure
of his Maje&s;ty, who had ordered the Lord-Chamber|lain
to &s;ignify in the Gazette, that no per&s;on who vi&s;ited
the Prince &s;hould be admitted to the court of St. James's.
His royal highne&s;s was dive&s;ted of all the external marks
of royalty, and lived like a private gentleman, cultivating
the virtues of a &s;ocial life, and enjoying the be&s;t fruits of
conjugal felicity. In the latter end of this month, Rear-Admiral
Haddock &s;et &s;ail with a &s;trong &s;quadron for the
Mediterranean, which it was hoped would give weight to
the negociation of the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter at the court of Ma|drid.
The act to di&s;courage the retail of &s;pirituous liquors
had incen&s;ed the populace to &s;uch a degree as occa&s;ioned
numberle&s;s tumults in the cities of London and We&s;tmin|&s;ter.
They were &s;o addicted to the u&s;e of that pernicious
compound known by the appellation of gin or geneva,
that they ran all ri&s;ques rather than forego it entirely;
and &s;o little regard was paid to the law by which it was
prohibited, that in le&s;s than two years twelve thou&s;and
per&s;ons within the bills of mortality were convicted of
having &s;old it illegally. Nearly one half of that number
were ca&s;t in the penalty of one hundred pounds: and three
thou&s;and per&s;ons paid ten pounds each, for an exemp|tion
from the di&s;grace of being committed to the hou&s;e of
correction.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. The war maintained by the Emperor and the
Czarina again&s;t the Ottoman Porte had not yet produced
any deci&s;ive event. Count Seckendorf was di&s;graced and
confined, on account of the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the la&s;t campaign.
General Doxat was tried by a council of war at Belgrade,
and condemned to death, for having &s;urrendered to the
enemy the town of Ni&s;&s;a, in which he commanded
<PB N="13" REF="17">
The diet of the empire granted a &s;ub&s;idy of fifty Roman
months to the Emperor, who began to make vigorous
preparations for the en&s;uing campaign: but, in the mean
time, Ragot&s;ki, vaivode of Tran&s;ylvania, revolted again&s;t
the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and brought a con&s;iderable army
into the field, under the protection of the Grand-Signor.
He was immediately proclaimed a rebel, and a price &s;et
upon his head by the court of Vienna. The Turks taking
the field early, reduced the fort of U&s;itza, and Meadia,
and undertook the &s;iege of Or&s;ova, which, however,
they abandoned at the approach of the Imperial army,
commanded by the Grand Duke of Tu&s;cany, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
Count Konig&s;egg. The Turks being re-enforced,
marched back, and attacked the Imperiali&s;ts, by whom
they were repul&s;ed after an ob&s;tinate engagement. The
Germans, notwith&s;tanding this advantage, repa&s;&s;ed the
Danube; and then the infidels made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of
Or&s;ova, where they found a fine train of artillery, de&s;igned
for the &s;iege of Widin. By the conque&s;t of this place,
the Turks laid the Danube open to their gallies and
ve&s;&s;els; and the Germans retired under the cannon of Bel|grade.
In the Ukraine, the Ru&s;&s;ians under General
Count Munich obtained the advantage over the Turks in
two engagements; and General Lacy routed the Tartars
of the Crimea: but they returned in greater numbers, and
harra&s;&s;ed the Mu&s;covites in &s;uch a manner, by intercepting
their provi&s;ions, and de&s;troying the country, that they
were obliged to abandon the lines of Precops.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. In the month of October, an affair of very
&s;mall importance produced a rupture between the King
of Denmark and the Elector of Hanover. A detachment
of Hanoverians took by a&s;&s;ault the ca&s;tle of Steinhor&s;t, be|longing
to the Privy-coun&s;ellor Wederkop, and defended
by thirty Dani&s;h dragoons, who had received orders to
repel force by force. Several men were killed on both
&s;ides, before the Hanoverians could enter the place, when
the garri&s;on was di&s;armed, and conducted to the frontiers.
This petty di&s;pute, about a &s;mall territory which did not
<PB N="14" REF="18">
yield the value of one thou&s;and pounds a year, had well
nigh involved Hanover in a war, which, in all probability,
Great-Britain mu&s;t have maintained: but this di&s;pute
was compromi&s;ed by a convention between the Kings of
England and Denmark.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. The &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was opened on the
fir&s;t day of February, when the King, in his &s;peech to
both Hou&s;es, gave them to under&s;tand, that a convention
was concluded and ratified between him and the King of
Spain, who had obliged him&s;elf to make reparation to the
Briti&s;h &s;ubjects for their lo&s;&s;es, by certain &s;tipulated pay|ments:
the plenipotentiaries were named and appointed
for regulating, within a limited time, all tho&s;e grievances
and abu&s;es which had hitherto interrupted the commerce
of Great-Britain in the American &s;eas; and for &s;ettling
all matters in di&s;pute, in &s;uch a manner as might for the
future prevent and remove all new cau&s;es and preten&s;es of
complaint. The motion for an addre&s;s of approbation
was di&s;puted as u&s;ual. Though the convention was not
yet laid before the Hou&s;e, the nature of it was well known
to the leaders of the oppo&s;ition. Sir William Wyndham
ob&s;erved, that if the mini&s;try had made the re&s;olutions
taken by the parliament in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion the foundation
of their demands; if they had di&s;covered a re&s;olution to
break off all treating, rather than depart from the &s;en&s;e
of parliament, either a defen&s;ive treaty might have been
obtained, or by this time the wor&s;t would have been
known: but, by what appeared from his Maje&s;ty's &s;peech,
the convention was no other than a preliminary; and,
in all probability, a very bad preliminary. He &s;up|po&s;ed
the mini&s;ter had ventured to clothe &s;ome of his
creatures with full powers to give up the rights of the
nation; for they might do it if they dur&s;t. Sir Robert
Walpole, in an&s;wer to the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, affirmed, that
the mini&s;try had on this occa&s;ion obtained more than ever
on like occa&s;ions was known to be obtained; that they
had reconciled the peace of their country with her true
intere&s;t: that this peace was attended with all the advan|tages
<PB N="15" REF="19">
that the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful arms could have procured:
that future ages would con&s;ider this as the mo&s;t glorious
period of our hi&s;tory, and do ju&s;tice to the councils that
produced the happy event, which every gentleman dive&s;ted
of pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice was ready to do; and which, he
believed, the pre&s;ent age, when rightly informed, would
not refu&s;e. In a word, he extolled his own convention
with the mo&s;t extravagant encomiums.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The Hou&s;e re&s;olved to addre&s;s the King, that
copies of all the memorials, repre&s;entations, letters, and
papers, pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, or his &s;ecretary of &s;tate,
relating to depredations, &s;hould be &s;ubmitted to the pe|ru&s;al
of the Hou&s;e: but &s;ome members in the oppo&s;ition
were not contented with this re&s;olution. Then Mr.
Sandys, who may be termed &startq;the motion-maker,&endq;
moved for an addre&s;s, de&s;iring that the Hou&s;e might in|&s;pect
all letters written, and in&s;tructions given by the &s;e|cretaries
of &s;tate, or commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty, to
any of the Briti&s;h governors in America, or any comman|der
in chief, or captains of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war, or
his Maje&s;ty's mini&s;ter at the court of Spain, or any of his
Maje&s;ty's con&s;uls in Europe, &s;ince the treaty of Seville,
relating to lo&s;&s;es which the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects had &s;u&s;tained
by means of depredations committed by the &s;ubjects of
Spain in Europe and America. This was an unrea&s;onable
propo&s;al, &s;ugge&s;ted by the &s;pirit of animo&s;ity and faction.
Mr. H. Walpole ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that a compliance with
&s;uch an addre&s;s might lay open the mo&s;t private tran&s;|actions
of the cabinet, and di&s;cover &s;ecrets that ought,
for the good of the kingdom, to be concealed. It would
di&s;cover to the court of Spain the <HI>ultimatum</HI> of the King's
demands and conce&s;&s;ions, and the nation would thereby
be deprived of many advantages which it might reap,
were no &s;uch di&s;covery made. He &s;aid, that as &s;oon as
the differences betwixt the two courts &s;hould arrive at &s;uch
a cri&s;is, and not before, the con&s;uls were in&s;tructed to
give notice to the merchants, that they might retire in
time with their effects; but, &s;hould &s;uch in&s;truction come
<PB N="16" REF="20">
to the knowledge of the Spaniards, it would be a kind of
watch-word to put them on their guard, and unavoidably
occa&s;ion the ruin of many thou&s;ands of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.
Certain it is, no government could act either in external
or dome&s;tick affairs with proper influence, dignity, and
di&s;patch, if every letter and in&s;truction relating to an
unfini&s;hed negociation &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the view of
&s;uch a numerous a&s;&s;embly, compo&s;ed of individuals actu|ated
by motives in them&s;elves diametrically oppo&s;ite. The
motion being rejected by the majority, the &s;ame gentle|man
moved again for an addre&s;s, that his Maje&s;ty would
give directions for laying before the Hou&s;e copies of &s;uch
memorials or repre&s;entations as had been made, either to
the King of Spain or to his mini&s;ters, &s;ince the treaty of
Seville, relating to the depredations committed in Europe
or America. A debate en&s;ued; and, upon a divi&s;ion, the
que&s;tion pa&s;&s;ed in the negative.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. The Hou&s;e, in a committee of &s;upply, voted
twelve thou&s;and &s;eamen for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year,
and the &s;tanding army was continued without reduction,
though powerfully attacked by the whole &s;trength of the
oppo&s;ition. The Commons likewi&s;e ordered an addre&s;s
to his Maje&s;ty, for the copies of &s;everal memorials &s;ince
the treaty of Seville, touching the rights of Great-Britain,
or any infraction of treaties which had not been laid before
them. The&s;e were accordingly &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pection
of the Hou&s;e. By this time the convention it&s;elf was not
only pre&s;ented to the Commons, but al&s;o publi&s;hed for
the information of the people. Divers merchants, plant|ers,
and others trading to America, the cities of London
and Bri&s;tol, the merchants of Liverpool, and the owners
of &s;undry &s;hips which had been &s;ei&s;ed by the Spaniards,
offered petitions again&s;t the convention, by which the
&s;ubjects of Spain were &s;o far from giving up their ground|le&s;s
and unju&s;tifiable practice of vi&s;iting and &s;earching
Briti&s;h &s;hips &s;ailing to and from the Briti&s;h plantations,
that they appeared to have claimed the power of doing i$
as a right: for they in&s;i&s;ted that the differences which
<PB N="17" REF="21">
had ari&s;en concerning it &s;hould be referred to plenipo|tentiaries,
to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by them, without even agreeing
to ab&s;tain from &s;uch vi&s;itation and &s;earch during the time
that the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this affair might la&s;t. They, there|fore,
prayed that they might have an opportunity of being
heard, and allowed to repre&s;ent the great importance of
the Briti&s;h trade to and from the plantations in America;
the clear indi&s;putable right which they had to enjoy it,
without being &s;topped, vi&s;ited, or &s;earched, by the Spa|niards,
on any pretence what&s;oever; and the certain in|evitable
de&s;truction of all the riches and &s;trength derived
to Great-Britain from that trade, if a &s;earch of Briti&s;h
&s;hips &s;ailing to and from their own plantations &s;hould be
tolerated upon any pretext, or under any re&s;tictions, or
even if the freedom of this navigation &s;hould continue
much longer in a &s;tate of uncertainty. The&s;e petitions
were referred to the committee appointed to con&s;ider of
the convention. Another remon&s;trance was likewi&s;e pre|&s;ented
by the tru&s;tees for e&s;tabli&s;hing the colony of Georgia,
&s;etting forth, that the King of Spain claimed that colony
as part of his territories; and that by the conventions the
regulation of the limits of Carolina and Florida was re|ferred
to the determination of plenipotentiaries; &s;o that
the colony of Georgia, which undoubtedly belonged to
the crown of Great-Britain, was left in di&s;pute, while the
&s;ettlers remained in the mo&s;t precarious and dangerous
&s;ituation. It was moved that the merchants &s;hould be
heard by their coun&s;el: but the propo&s;al was &s;trenuou&s;ly
oppo&s;ed by the mini&s;try, and rejected upon a divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. This famous convention, concluded at the
Pardo on the fourteenth day of January, imported, That
within &s;ix weeks, to be reckoned from the day on which
the ratifications were exchanged, two mini&s;ters pleni|potentiaries
&s;hould meet at Madrid, to con$er and finally
regulate the re&s;pective preten&s;ions of the two crowns, with
relation to the trade and navigation in America and Eu|rope,
and to the limits of Florida and Carolina, as well as
concerning other points which remained likewi&s;e to be
<PB N="18" REF="22">
adju&s;ted, according to the former treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween
the two nations: That the plenipotentiaries &s;hould
fini&s;h their conferences within the &s;pace of eight months:
That in the mean time no progre&s;s &s;hould be made in the
fortifications of Florida and Carolina: That his Catho|lick
Maje&s;ty &s;hould pay to the King of Great-Britain the
&s;um of ninety-five thou&s;and pounds, for a balance due to
the crown and &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, after deduction
made of the demands of the crown and &s;ubjects of Spain:
That this &s;um &s;hould be employed for the &s;atisfaction, di&s;|charge
and payment of the demands of the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects
upon the crown of Spain: That this reciprocal di&s;charge,
however, &s;hould not extend or relate to the accounts and
differences which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted and were to be &s;ettled between
the crown of Spain and the a&s;&s;iento company, nor to any
particular or private contracts that might &s;ub&s;i&s;t between
either of the two crowns, or their mini&s;ters, with the &s;ub|jects
of the other; or between the &s;ubjects and &s;ubjects of
each nation re&s;pectively: That his Catholick Maje&s;ty
&s;hould cau&s;e the &s;um of ninety-five thou&s;and pounds to be
paid at London within four months, to be reckoned from
the day on which the ratifications were exchanged. Such
was the &s;ub&s;tance of that convention, which alarmed and
provoked the merchants and traders of Great Britain,
excited the indignation of all tho&s;e who retained any
regard for the honour of their country, and rai&s;ed a ge|neral
cry again&s;t the mini&s;ter who &s;tood at the helm of
admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The eyes of the whole kingdom were now
turned upon the Hou&s;e of Commons. The two contend|ing
parties &s;ummoned their whole force for the approach|ing
di&s;pute: on the day appointed for con&s;idering the
convention, four hundred members had taken their &s;eats
by eight in the morning. In a committee of the whole
Hou&s;e, certain We&s;t-India merchants and planters were
heard again&s;t the convention: &s;o that this and the follow|ing
day were employed in reading papers and obtaining in|formation.
On the eighth day of March Mr. H. Walpole
<PB N="19" REF="23">
having launched out in the prai&s;e of that agreement, moved
for an addre&s;s of approbation to his Maje&s;ty. He was &s;econd|ed
by Mr. Campbell, of Pembroke&s;hire; and the debate
began with extraordinary ardour. He who fir&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
him&s;elf in the li&s;ts was Sir Thomas Sander&s;on,
at that time trea&s;urer to the Prince of Wales, afterwards
Earl of Scarborough. All the officers and adherents of
his royal highne&s;s had joined the oppo&s;ition; and he him|&s;elf
on this occa&s;ion &s;at in the gallery, to hear the debate
on &s;uch an important tran&s;action. Sir Thomas Sander|&s;on
ob&s;erved, that the Spaniards by the convention, in&s;tead
of giving us reparation, had obliged us to give them a ge|neral
relea&s;e. They had not allowed the word Satisfaction
to be &s;o much as once mentioned in the treaty. Even
the Spani&s;h pirate who had cut off the ear of Captain Jen|kins
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Captain Jenkins was ma&s;ter of a Scotti&s;h merchant &s;hip. He was board|ed by the captain of a Spani&s;h guarda-co&s;ta, who treated him in the mo&s;t barbarous manner. The Spaniards, after having rummaged his ve&s;&s;el for what they called contraband commodities, without finding any thing to ju&s;tify their &s;earch, in&s;ulted Jenkins with the mo&s;t opprobrious invectives. They tore off one of his ears, bidding him carry it to his King, and tell him they would &s;erve him in the &s;ame manner &s;hould an opportunity offer: they tortured him with the mo&s;t &s;hocking cruelty, and threatened him with immediate death. This man was examined at the bar of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, and being a&s;ked by a member, what he thought when he &s;ound him|&s;elf in the hands of &s;uch barbarians? &startq;I recommended my &s;oul to God (&s;aid he) and my cau&s;e to my country.&endq; The behaviour of this brave &s;eaman, the &s;ight of his ear, which was produced, with his account of the indignities which had been offered to the nation and &s;overeign of Great-Britain, filled the whole Hou&s;e with indignation. Jenkins was afterwards employed in the &s;ervice of the Ea&s;t-India company: he approved him&s;elf worthy of his good fortune, in a long engagement with the pirate Angria, during which he be|haved with extraordinary courage and conduct; and &s;aved his own&s;hip, with three others that were under his convoy.</NOTE>, and u&s;ed the mo&s;t in&s;ulting expre&s;&s;ion towards the
per&s;on of the King&mdash;an expreion which no Briti&s;h &s;ub|ject
could decently repeat&mdash;an expre&s;&s;ion an expre&s;&s;ion which no man
that had a regard for his &s;overeign could ever forgive&mdash;even
this fellow lived to enjoy the fruits of his rapine, and re|mained
a living te&s;timony of the cowardly tamene&s;s and
mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Great-Britain; of the triumphant
<PB N="20" REF="24">
haughtine&s;s, and &s;tubborn pride of Spain. Lord Gage,
one of the mo&s;t keen, &s;pirited, and &s;arca&s;tick orators in
the Hou&s;e, &s;tated in this manner the account of the &s;atis|faction
obtained from the court of Spain by the conven|tion:
the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the Spani&s;h depredations
amounted to three hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds.
The commi&s;&s;ary, by a &s;troke of his pen, reduced this de|mand
to two hundred thou&s;and pounds; then forty-five
thou&s;and were &s;truck off for prompt payment. He next
allotted &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds as the remaining part of a
debt pretended to be due to Spain, for the de&s;truction of
her fleet by Sir George Byng, though it appeared by the
in&s;tructions on the table, that Spain had been already
amply &s;atisfied on that head. The&s;e deductions reduced
the balance to ninety-five thou&s;and pounds, but the King
of Spain in&s;i&s;ted upon the South-Sea company's paying
immediately the &s;um of &s;ixty-eight thou&s;and pounds, as a
debt due to him on one head of accounts, though, in other
articles, his Catholick Maje&s;ty was indebted to the com|pany
a million over and above this demand. The re|mainder
to be paid by Spain did not exceed &s;even-and-twenty
thou&s;and pounds, from which &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon
deducting whatever &s;he might have already given in &s;atis|faction
for any of the Briti&s;h &s;hips that had been taken;
and on being allowed the value of the St. There&s;a, a
Spani&s;h &s;hip which had been &s;ei&s;ed in the port of Dublin.
Mr. W. Pitt, with an energy of argument and diction
peculiar to him&s;elf, declaimed again&s;t the convention, as
in&s;ecure, un&s;atisfactory, and di&s;honourable to Great-Britain.
He &s;aid the great national objection, the &s;earch|ing
of Briti&s;h &s;hips, was not omitted, indeed, in the pre|amble;
but &s;tood there as the reproach of the whole, as
the &s;tronge&s;t evidence of the fatal &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that followed:
on the part of Spain, an u&s;urpation, an inhuman tyranny
claimed and exerci&s;ed over the American &s;eas: on the part
of England, an undoubted right by treaties, and from
God and nature declared and a&s;&s;erted in the re&s;olutions of
parliament, were now referred to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of ple|nipotentiaries,
<PB N="21" REF="25">
upon one and the &s;ame equal foot. This
undoubted right was to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and regulated; and if
to regulate be to pre&s;cribe rules, as in all con&s;tructions it is,
that right was, by the expre&s;s words of the convention,
to be given up and &s;acrificed: for it mu&s;t cea&s;e to be any
thing from the moment it is &s;ubmitted to limitation. Mr.
Lyttelton, with equal force and fluency, an&s;wered the
&s;peech of Mr. H. Walpole. &startq;After he had u&s;ed many
arguments to per&s;uade us to peace (&s;aid he) to any
peace, good or bad, by pointing out the dangers of a
war, dangers I by no means allow to be &s;uch as he re|pre&s;ents
them, he crowned all tho&s;e terrors with the
name of the Pretender. It would be the cau&s;e of the
Pretender. The Pretender would come. Is the ho|nourable
gentleman &s;en&s;ible what this language im|ports?
The people of England complain of the greate&s;t
wrongs and indignities: they complain of the inter|ruption,
the de&s;truction of their trade: they think the
peace has left them in a wor&s;e condition than before;
and in an&s;wer to all the&s;e complaints, what are they told?
Why, that their continuing to &s;uffer all this, is the
price they mu&s;t pay to keep the King and his family on
the throne of the&s;e realms. If this were true, it ought
not to be owned; but it is far from truth; the very
rever&s;e is true. Nothing can weaken the family; no|thing
&s;hake the e&s;tabli&s;hment, but &s;uch mea&s;ures as
the&s;e, and &s;uch language as this.&endq; He affirmed, that
if the mini&s;ters had proceeded conformably to the inten|tions
of parliament, they would either have acted with
vigour, or have obtained a real &s;ecurity in an expre&s;s ac|knowledgment
of our right not to be &s;earched, as a pre|liminary,
<HI>&s;ine qua non,</HI> to our treating at all. In&s;tead of
this, they had referred it to plenipotentiaries. &startq;Would
you, Sir (&s;aid he) &s;ubmit to a reference, whether you
may travel unmole&s;ted from your hou&s;e in town to your
hou&s;e in the country? Your right is clear and un|deniable,
why would you have it di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; but much
le&s;s would you refer it, if two of your judges belonged
<PB N="22" REF="26">
to a gang which has often &s;topped and robbed you i$
your way thither before.&endq;&mdash;The mini&s;ters, in vindi|cation
of the convention, a&s;&s;erted, that the &s;atisfaction
granted by Spain was adequate to the injury received: that
it was only the preliminary of a treaty which would remove
all cau&s;es of complaint: that war was always expen&s;ive
and detrimental to a trading nation, as well as uncertain
in its events: that France and Spain would certainly join
their forces in ca&s;e of a rupture with Great-Britain: that
there was not one power in Europe upon which the En|gli&s;h
could depend for effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and that war
would favour the cau&s;e and de&s;igns of a popi&s;h pretender.
The Hou&s;e, upon a divi&s;ion, agreed to the addre&s;s; but
when a motion was made for its being recommitted, the
two parties renewed the engagement with redoubled
eagerne&s;s and impetuo&s;ity. Sir William Wyndham and
Mr. Pulteney poured all the thunder of their eloquence
again&s;t the in&s;olence of Spain, and the conce&s;&s;ions of the
Briti&s;h mini&s;try. Sir Robert Walpole exerted all his for|titude
and dexterity in defence of him&s;elf and his mea&s;ures,
and the que&s;tion being put, the re&s;olutions for the addre&s;s
were carried by a &s;mall majority.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. Then Sir William Wyndham &s;tanding up|made
a pathetick remon&s;trance upon this determination.
&startq;This addre&s;s (&s;aid he) is intended to convince man|kind,
that the treaty under our con&s;ideration is a rea|&s;onable
and an honourable treaty. But if a majority of
twenty-eight in &s;uch a full Hou&s;e &s;hould fail of that
&s;ucce&s;s; if the people &s;hould not implicitly re&s;ign their
rea&s;on to a vote of this Hou&s;e, what will be the con&s;e|quence?
Will not the parliament lo&s;e its authority?
Will it not be thought, that even in the parliament we
are governed by a faction? and what the con&s;equence
of this may be, I leave to tho&s;e gentlemen to con&s;ider,
who are now to give their vote for this addre&s;s: for my
own part, I will trouble you no more; but, with the&s;e
my la&s;t words, I &s;incerely pray to Almighty God, who
has &s;o often wonderfully protected the&s;e kingdoms, that
he will graciou&s;ly continue his protection over them, by
<PB N="23" REF="27">
pre&s;erving us from that impending danger which threat|ens
the nation from without, and likewi&s;e from that
impending danger which threatens our con&s;titution
from within.&endq; The mini&s;ter was on this occa&s;ion
de&s;erted by his u&s;ual temper, and even provoked into
per&s;onal abu&s;e. He declared, that the gentleman who
was now the mouth of his opponents had been look|ed
upon as the head of tho&s;e traitors, who twenty-five
years before con&s;pired the de&s;truction of their country
and of the royal family, in order to &s;et a popi&s;h pretender
upon the throne: that he was &s;ei&s;ed by the vigilance
of the then government, and pardoned by its clemency;
but all the u&s;e he had ungratefully made of that clemency,
was to qualify him&s;elf according to law, that he and his
party might &s;ome time or other have an opportunity to
overthrow all law. He branded them all as traitors, and
expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that their behaviour would unite all
the true friends of the pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;hment. To
&s;uch a degree of mutual animo&s;ity were both &s;ides inflamed,
that the mo&s;t eminent members of the minority actually
retired from parliament; and were by the nation in gene|ral
revered as martyrs to the liberty of the people.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. The di&s;pute occa&s;ioned by the convention in the
Hou&s;e of Lords was maintained with equal warmth, and
perhaps with more abilities. After this famous treaty had
been con&s;idered, Lord Carteret &s;ugge&s;ted, that po&s;&s;ibly one
of the contracting powers had pre&s;ented a prote&s;t or de|claration,
importing that &s;he acceded to &s;uch or &s;uch a
mea&s;ure, only upon condition that the terms of that pro|te&s;t
or declaration &s;hould be made good. He &s;aid, that
until his mind &s;hould be free from the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;u&s;|picion
that &s;uch a paper might exi&s;t in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e,
he could not form a ju&s;t opinion of the tran&s;action him&s;elf,
nor communicate to their lord&s;hips any light which might
be nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e. The adherents to the mini&s;try
endeavoured to evade his curio&s;ity in this particular, by
general a&s;&s;ertions: but he in&s;i&s;ted on his &s;u&s;picion with
&s;uch per&s;everance, that at length the mini&s;try produced
the copy of a declaration made by the King of Spain before
<PB N="24" REF="28">
he ratified the convention, &s;ignifying that his Catholick
Maje&s;ty re&s;erved to him&s;elf, in its full force, the right of
being able to &s;u&s;pend the a&s;&s;iento of negroes, in ca&s;e the
company &s;hould not pay within a &s;hort time the &s;um of
&s;ixty-eight thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, owing to Spain on
the duty of negroes, or on the profit of the &s;hip Caroline:
That under the validity and force of this prote&s;t, the
&s;igning of the &s;aid convention might be proceeded on,
and in no other manner. In the debate that en&s;ued, Lord
Carteret di&s;played a &s;urpri&s;ing extent of political know|ledge,
recommended by all the graces of elocution, cha&s;te,
pure, dignified, and delicate. Lord Bathur&s;t argued again&s;t
the articles of convention with his u&s;ual &s;pirit, integrity,
and good &s;en&s;e, particularly animated by an hone&s;t indig|nation,
which the wrongs of his country had in&s;pired.
The Earl of Che&s;terfield attacked this inglorious mea&s;ure
with all the weight of argument, and all the poignancy of
&s;atire. The Duke of Argyle, no longer a parti&s;an of the
mini&s;try, inveighed again&s;t it as infamous, treacherous,
and de&s;tructive, with all the fire, impetuo&s;ity, and en|thu&s;ia&s;m
of declamation. It was defended with unequal
arms by the Duke of Newca&s;tle, the Earl of Cholmond|ley,
Lord Hervey, the Lord Chancellor, the Bi&s;hop of
Sali&s;bury, and in particular by the Earl of Ilay, a noble|man
of exten&s;ive capacity and uncommon erudition; re|markable
for his knowledge of the civil law; and &s;eem|ingly
formed by nature for a politician; cool, di&s;cerning,
plau&s;ible, artful, and enterpri&s;ing; &s;taunch to the mini|&s;ter,
and invariably true to his own intere&s;t. The di&s;pute
was learned, long, and ob&s;tinate: but ended as u&s;ual in
the di&s;comfiture of tho&s;e who had &s;tigmati&s;ed the treaty.
The Hou&s;e agreed to an addre&s;s, in which they
thanked his Maje&s;ty for his gracious conde&s;cen&s;ion in lay|ing
before them the convention. They acknowledged his
great prudence in bringing the demands of his &s;ubjects
for their pa&s;t lo&s;&s;es, which had been &s;o long depending,
to a final adju&s;tment; in procuring an expre&s;s &s;tipulation
for a &s;peedy payment; and in laying a foundation for ac|compli&s;hing
<PB N="25" REF="29">
the great and de&s;irable ends of obtaining
future &s;ecurity, and pre&s;erving the peace between the two
nations. They declared their confidence in his royal
wi&s;dom, that in the treaty to be concluded in pur&s;uance of
the convention, proper provi&s;ions would be made for the
redre&s;s of the grievances of which the nation had &s;o ju&s;tly
complained: They a&s;&s;ured his Maje&s;ty, that in ca&s;e his
ju&s;t expectations &s;hould not be an&s;wered, the Hou&s;e would
heartily and zealou&s;ly concur in all &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hould
be nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate his Maje&s;ty's honour, and to pre|&s;erve
to his &s;ubjects the full enjoyment of all tho&s;e rights
to which they were entitled by treaty and the law of na|tions.
This was a hard-won victory. At the head of
tho&s;e who voted again&s;t the addre&s;s we find the Prince of
Wales. His example was followed by &s;ix dukes, two-and
twenty earls, four vi&s;counts, eighteen barons, four bi&s;hops,
and their party was re-enforced by &s;ixteen proxies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1739.</NOTE> A &s;pi|rited
prote&s;t was entered and &s;ub&s;cribed by nine-and-thirty
peers, comprehending all the noblemen of the kingdom
who were mo&s;t eminent for their talents, integrity, and
virtue.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. A me&s;&s;age having been delivered to the Hou&s;e
from his Maje&s;ty, importing, That he had &s;ettled nine-and-thirty
thou&s;and pounds per annum on the younger
children of the royal family; and de&s;iring thier lord&s;hips
would bring in a bill to enable his Maje&s;ty to make that pro|vi&s;ion
good, out of the hereditary revenues of the crown,
&s;ome lords in the oppo&s;ition ob&s;erved that the next heir to
the crown might look upon this &s;ettlement as a mortgage
of his revenue, which a parliament had no power to
make: that formerly no daughter of the royal family was
ever provided for by parliament, except the elde&s;t, and
that never was by way of annuity, but an expre&s;s provi|&s;ion
of a determinate &s;um of money paid by way of
dowry. The&s;e objections were over-ruled; and the Hou&s;e
complied with his Maje&s;ty's reque&s;t. Then the Duke of
Newca&s;tle produced a &s;ub&s;idy-treaty, by which his Maje&s;ty
obliged him&s;elf to pay to the King of Denmark &s;eventy
<PB N="26" REF="30">
thou&s;and pounds per annum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1739.</NOTE> on condition of the Danes
furni&s;hing to his Britannick Maje&s;ty a body of &s;ix thou&s;and
men, when demanded. At the &s;ame time, his grace deli|vered
a me&s;&s;age from the King, de&s;iring the Hou&s;e would
enable him to fulfil this engagement; and al&s;o to rai&s;e
what money and troops the exigency of affairs, during
the approaching rece&s;s, might require. Another vehe|ment
di&s;pute aro&s;e from this propo&s;al. With re&s;pect
to the treaty, Lord Carteret ob&s;erved, that no u&s;e could
be made of the Dani&s;h troops in any expedition under|taken
again&s;t Spain, becau&s;e it was &s;tipulated in the treaty,
that they &s;hould not be u&s;ed either in Italy, or on board
of the fleet, or be tran&s;ported in whole or in part beyond
&s;ea, after they &s;hould have marched out of the territories
of Denmark, except for the defence of the kingdoms of
Great-Britain and Ireland: nay, &s;hould France join
again&s;t the Engli&s;h, the Danes could not act again&s;t that
power or Spain, except as part of an army formed in
Germany or Flanders. This body of Danes may be &s;aid,
therefore, to have been retained for the defence and pro|tection
of Hanover: or, if the intere&s;t of Britain was at
all con&s;ulted in the treaty, it mu&s;t have been in prevent|ing
the Danes from joining their fleets to tho&s;e of France
and Spain. Then he argued again&s;t the &s;econd part of
the me&s;&s;age with great vivacity. He &s;aid nothing could
be more dangerous to the con&s;titution than a general and
unlimited vote of credit. Such a demand our ance&s;tors
would have heard with amazement, and rejected with
&s;corn. He affirmed that the practice was but of modern
da$e in England: that it was never heard of before the
Revolution; and never became frequent until the nation
was ble&s;&s;ed with the pre&s;ent wi&s;e admini&s;tration. He
&s;aid, if ever a general vote of credit and confidence
&s;hould become a cu&s;tomary compliment from the parlia|ment
to the crown at the end of every &s;e&s;&s;ion, or as often
as the mini&s;ter might think fit to de&s;ire it, parliaments
would grow de&s;picable in the eyes of the people: then a
proclamation might be ea&s;ily &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead, and
<PB N="27" REF="31">
happy would it be for the nation if that &s;hould be &s;uffi|cient;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1739.</NOTE>
for when a parliament cea&s;es to be a check upon
mini&s;ters, it becomes an u&s;ele&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary burthen
on the people. The repre&s;entatives mu&s;t always be paid
&s;ome way or other: if their wages are not paid openly
and &s;urely by their re&s;pective con&s;tituents, as they were
formerly, a majority of them may in future times be al|ways
ready to accept of wages from the admini&s;tration,
and the&s;e mu&s;t come out of the pockets of the people.
The Duke of Argyle and the Earl of Che&s;terfield enlarg|ed
upon the &s;ame topicks. Neverthele&s;s, the Hou&s;e com|plied
with the me&s;&s;age; and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, in which
they not only approved of the treaty with Denmark, but
likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured his Maje&s;ty they would concur with his
mea&s;ures, and &s;upport him in fulfilling his engagements, as
well as in making &s;uch further augmentation of his forces
by &s;ea and land, as he &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary for the ho|nour,
intere&s;t, and &s;afety of the&s;e kingdoms.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The &s;ame me&s;&s;age being communicated to the
Commons, they voted &s;eventy thou&s;and five hundred and
eighty three pounds, for the &s;ub&s;idy to Denmark, and
five hundred thou&s;and pounds for augmenting the forces
on any emergency. As Great-Britain &s;tood engaged by
the convention to pay the crown of Spain the &s;um of
&s;ixty thou&s;and pounds in con&s;ideration of the &s;hips taken
and de&s;troyed by Sir George Byng, which &s;um was to be
applied to the relief of the Briti&s;h merchants who had
&s;uffered by the Spani&s;h depredations, the Commons in&s;ert|ed
in a bill a clau&s;e, providing for this &s;um to be paid
by the parliament. When the bill was read in the
Hou&s;e of Lords a motion was made by Lord Bathur&s;t
for an addre&s;s, to know, whether Spain had paid the
money &s;tipulated by the convention, as the time limited
for the payment of it was now expired? The Duke of New|ca&s;tle,
by his Maje&s;ty's permi&s;&s;ion, acquainted the Hou&s;e,
that it was not paid; and that Spain had as yet given
no rea&s;on for the non-payment. Then a day was appoint|ed
to con&s;ider the &s;tate of the nation, when Lord Carteret
<PB N="28" REF="32">
moved for a re&s;olution, that the failure of Spain in this
particular was a breach of the convention, a high indig|nity
to his Maje&s;ty, and an inju&s;tice to the nation: but
after a warm debate, this motion was over-ruled by the
majority. The mini&s;ter, in order to atone in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
for the unpopular &s;tep he had taken in the conven|tion&punc;
allowed a &s;alutary law to pa&s;s for the encouragement
of the woollen manufacture; and two bills in behalf of
the &s;ugar colonies, one permitting them, for a limited time,
to export their produce directly to foreign parts, under
proper re&s;trictions; and the other making more effectual
provi&s;ions for &s;ecuring the duties laid upon the importa|tion
of foreign &s;ugars, rum, and mela&s;&s;es into Great-Britain,
and his Maje&s;ty's plantations in America. The &s;upplies
being voted, the funds e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the crown grati|fied
in every particular, the King clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with
a &s;peech on the fourteenth day of June, when the Chan|cellor
in his Maje&s;ty's name prorogued the parliament<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Among the laws enacted in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion was an act again&s;t gaming, which had become univer&s;al through all ranks of people, and likely to prove de&s;tructive of all morals, indu&s;try, and &s;entiment. Ano|ther bill pa&s;&s;ed, for granting a reward to Joanna Stevens, on her di&s;co|vering, for the benefit of the publick, a no&s;trum for the cure of per&s;ons afflicted with the &s;tone; a medicine which has by no means an&s;wered the expectations of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>In the Hou&s;e of Lords complaint was made by Lord Delawar, of a &s;a|tire, intituled Manners, written by Mr. Whitehead; in which &s;ome cha|racters of di&s;tinction were &s;everely la&s;hed, in the true &s;pirit of poetry. It was voted a libel; a motion was made to take the author into cu&s;tody: but he having withdrawn him&s;elf, the re&s;entment of the Hou&s;e fell upon R. Dod&s;ley, the publi&s;her of the work, who was committed to the u&s;her of the black-rod, though Lord Carteret, the Earl of Abingdon, and Lord Talbot, &s;poke in his behalf.</P>.</NOTE></P>
<P>&sect; XXII. Letters of marque and repri&s;al were granted
again&s;t the Spaniards: a promotion was made of general
officers: the troops were augmented: a great fleet was
a&s;&s;embled at Spithead; a re-enforcement &s;et out to
Admiral Haddock; and an embargo laid on all merchant
&s;hips outward bound. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e prepara|tions
of war, Mr. Keen, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter at Madrid,
declared to the court of Spain, that his ma&s;ter, although
he had permitted his &s;ubjects to make repri&s;als, would
<PB N="29" REF="33">
not be under&s;tood to have broken the peace; and that
this permi&s;&s;ion would be recalled as &s;oon as his Catholick
Maje&s;ty &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to make the &s;atisfaction which
had been &s;o ju&s;tly demanded. He was given to under|&s;tand,
that the King of Spain looked upon tho&s;e repri&s;als
as acts of ho&s;tility; and that he hoped, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of heaven and his allies, he &s;hould be able to &s;upport a
good cau&s;e again&s;t his adver&s;aries. He publi&s;hed a ma|nife&s;to
in ju&s;tification of his own conduct, complaining
that Admiral Haddock had received orders to crui&s;e with
his &s;quadron between the capes St. Vincent and St. Mary,
in order to &s;urpri&s;e the a&s;&s;ogue &s;hips; that letters of re|pri&s;al
had been publi&s;hed at London, in an indecent &s;tyle,
and even carried into execution in different parts of the
world. He excu&s;ed his non-payment of the ninety-five
thou&s;and pounds &s;tipulated in the convention, by affirm|ing
that the Briti&s;h court had fir&s;t contravened the arti|cles
of that treaty, by the orders &s;ent to Haddock; by
continuing to fortify Georgia; by re-enforcing the &s;qua|dron
at Jamaica; and by eluding the payment of the
&s;ixty-eight thou&s;and pounds due to Spain from the South-Sea
company, on the a&s;&s;iento for negroes. The French
amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, declared that the King his
ma&s;ter was obliged by treaties to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Catholick
Maje&s;ty by &s;ea and land, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be attacked;
he di&s;&s;uaded the States-General from e&s;pou&s;ing the quar|rel
of Great-Britain; and they a&s;&s;ured him they would
ob&s;erve a &s;trict neutrality, though they could not avoid
furni&s;hing his Britannick-Maje&s;ty with &s;uch &s;uccours
as he could demand, by virtue of the treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
between the two powers. The people of England were
in&s;pired with uncommon alacrity at the near pro&s;pect of
war, for which they had &s;o long clamoured; and the
mini&s;try &s;eeing it unavoidable, began to be earne&s;t and
effectual in their preparations.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. The events of war were &s;till unfavourable
to the Emperor. He had be&s;towed the command of his
army upon Velt mare&s;chal Count Wallis, who a&s;&s;embled
<PB N="30" REF="34">
his forces in the neighbourhood of Belgrade, and advanc|ed
towards Crot&s;ka, where he was attacked by the Turks
with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity and per&s;everance, that he was
obliged to give ground, after a long and ob&s;tinate engage|ment,
in which he lo&s;t above &s;ix thou&s;and men. The Earl
of Crawford, who &s;erved as a volunteer in the Imperial
army, &s;ignalized his courage in an extraordinary manner
on this occa&s;ion, and received a dangerous wound, of
which he never perfectly recovered. The Turks were
afterwards wor&s;ted at Jabouka: neverthele&s;s, their grand
army inve&s;ted Belgrade on the &s;ide of Servia, and carried
on the operations of the &s;iege with extraordinary vigour.
The Emperor, dreading the lo&s;s of this place, &s;eeing his
finances exhau&s;ted, and his army con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed,
con&s;ented to a negociation for peace, which was tran&s;|acted
under the mediation of the French amba&s;&s;ador at the
Ottoman Porte. The Count de Neuperg, as Imperial
plenipotentiary, &s;igned the preliminaries on the fir&s;t day of
September. They were ratified by the Emperor, though
he pretended to be di&s;&s;atisfied with the articles; and de|clared
that his mini&s;ter had exceeded his powers. By
this treaty the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria ceded to the Grand
Signor Belgrade, Sabatz, Servia, Au&s;trian Walachia, the
i&s;le and fortre&s;s of Or&s;ova, with the fort of St. Elizabeth;
and the contracting powers agreed that the Danube and
the Saave &s;hould &s;erve as boundaries to the two empires.
The Emperor publi&s;hed a circular letter, addre&s;&s;ed to his
mini&s;ters at all the courts in Europe, blaming Count
Wallis for the bad &s;ucce&s;s of the la&s;t campaign, and di&s;|owning
the negociations of Count Neuperg: nay, the&s;e
two officers were actually di&s;graced, and confined in
different ca&s;tles. This, however, was no other than a
&s;acrifice to the re&s;entment of the Czarina, who loudly
complained, that the Emperor had concluded a &s;eparate
peace, contrary to his engagements with the Ru&s;&s;ian
empire. Her general, Count Munich, had obtained a
victory over the Turks at Choczim in Moldavia, and
made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of that place, in which he found two
<PB N="31" REF="35">
hundred pieces of artillery: but the country was &s;o
ruined by the incur&s;ions of the Tartars, that the Mu&s;|covites
could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t in it during the winter. The
Czarina finding her&s;elf abandoned by the Emperor, and
unable to cope with the whole power of the Ottoman
empire, took the fir&s;t opportunity of putting an end to
the war upon honourable terms. After a &s;hort negocia|tion,
the conferences ended in a treaty, by which &s;he
was left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of A&s;oph, on condition that its for|tifications
&s;hould be demoli&s;hed; and the ancient limits
were re-e&s;tabli&s;hed between the two empires.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. A rupture between Great-Britain and Spain
was now become inevitable. The Engli&s;h &s;quadron in
the Mediterranean had already made prize of two rich
Caracca &s;hips. The King had i&s;&s;ued orders for augment|ing
his land-forces, and rai&s;ing a body of marines: and a
great number of &s;hips of war were put in commi&s;&s;ion.
Admiral Vernon had been &s;ent to the We&s;t-Indies, to
a&s;&s;ume the command of the &s;quadron in tho&s;e &s;eas; and
to annoy the trade and &s;ettlements of the Spaniards.
This gentleman had rendered him&s;elf con&s;iderable in the
Hou&s;e of Commons, by loudly condemning all the mea|&s;ures
of the mini&s;try, and bluntly &s;peaking his &s;entiments,
whatever they were, without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, and &s;ome|times
without any regard to decorum. He was counted
a good officer, and this boi&s;terous manner &s;eemed to en|hance
his character. As he had once commanded a &s;qua|dron
in Jamaica, he was perfectly well acquainted with
tho&s;e &s;eas; and in a debate upon the Spani&s;h depredations.
he chanced to a&s;&s;irm, that Porto-Bello on the Spani&s;h main
might be ea&s;ily taken: nay, he even undertook to reduce
it with &s;ix &s;hips only. This offer was echoed from the
mouths of all the members in the oppo&s;ition. Vernon
was extolled as another Drake or Raleigh: he became the
idol of a party, and his prai&s;e re&s;ounded from all corners
of the kingdom. The mini&s;ter, in order to appea&s;e the
clamours of the people on this &s;ubject, &s;ent him as com|mander
in chief to the We&s;t-Indies. He was plea&s;ed with
<PB N="32" REF="36">
an opportunity to remove &s;uch a trouble&s;ome cen&s;or from
the Hou&s;e of Commons; and perhaps, he was not without
hope, that Vernon would di&s;grace him&s;elf and his party,
by failling in the exploit he had undertaken. His Catho|lick
Maje&s;ty having ordered all the Briti&s;h &s;hips in his
harbours to be &s;ei&s;ed and detained, the King of England
would keep mea&s;ure with him no longer, but denounced
war again&s;t him on the twenty-third day of October.
Many Engli&s;h merchants began to equip privateers, and
arm their trading ve&s;&s;els, to protect their own commerce,
as well as to di&s;tre&s;s that of the enemy. The &s;e&s;&s;ion of
parliament was opened in November, when the King, in
his &s;peech to both Hou&s;es, declared that he had augment|ed
his forces by &s;ea and land, pur&s;uant to the power ve&s;ted
in him by parliament for the &s;ecurity of his dominions,
the protection of trade, and the annoyance of the enemy;
and he expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ion, that the heats and
animo&s;ities which had been indu&s;triou&s;ly fomented through|out
the kingdom encouraged Spain to act in &s;uch a man|ner
as rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for him to have recour&s;e to
arms. In an&s;wer to this &s;peech, affectionate addre&s;&s;es
were pre&s;ented by both Hou&s;es, without any con&s;iderable
oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. The &s;eceding members had again re&s;umed
their &s;eats in the Hou&s;e of Commons; and Mr. Pulteney
thought proper to vindicate the extraordinary &s;tep which
they had taken. He &s;aid, they thought that &s;tep was ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
as affairs then &s;tood, for clearing their characters to
po&s;terity from the imputation of &s;itting in an a&s;&s;embly where
a determined majority gave a &s;anction to mea&s;ures evidently
to the di&s;grace of his Maje&s;ty and the nation. He ob&s;erv|ed,
that their conduct was &s;o fully ju&s;tified by the decla|ration
of war again&s;t Spain, that any further vindication
would be &s;uperfluous; for every a&s;&s;ertion contained in it
had been almo&s;t in the &s;ame words in&s;i&s;ted upon by tho&s;e
who oppo&s;ed the convention: &startq;Every &s;entence in it (added
he) is an echo of what was &s;aid in our rea&s;oning;
again&s;t that treaty: every po&s;itive truth which the
<PB N="33" REF="37">
declaration lays down was denied with the utmo&s;t con|fidence
by tho&s;e who &s;poke for the convention; and,
&s;ince that time, there has not one event happened which
was not then fore&s;een and foretold.&endq; He propo&s;ed,
that in maintaining the war, the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements in
the We&s;t-Indies &s;hould be attacked; and that the mini&s;try
&s;hould not have the power to give up the conque&s;ts that
might be made. He &s;aid he heartily wi&s;hed, for his
Maje&s;ty's honour and &s;ervice, that no mention had been
made of heats and animo&s;ities in the King's &s;peech; and
gave it as his opinion, that they &s;hould take no notice
of that clau&s;e in their addre&s;s. He was an&s;wered by Sir
Robert Walpole, who took occa&s;ion to &s;ay, he was in
no great concern le&s;t the &s;ervice of his Maje&s;ty or the
nation &s;hould &s;uffer by the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e members who
had quitted the Hou&s;e: he affirmed the nation was gene|rally
&s;en&s;ible, that the many u&s;eful and popular acts which
pa&s;&s;ed towards the end of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion were greatly for|warded
and facilitated by the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e gentlemen;
and, if they were returned only to oppo&s;e and perplex, he
&s;hould not be at all &s;orry to &s;ee them &s;ecede again.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. Mr. Pulteney revived the bill which he had
formerly prepared for the encouragement of &s;eamen.
After a long di&s;pute and eager oppo&s;ition by the mini|&s;try,
it pa&s;&s;ed both Hou&s;es, and obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent.
Mr. Sandys having ob&s;erved, that there could be no
immediate u&s;e for a great number of forces in the king|dom;
and explained how little &s;ervice could be expected
from raw and undi&s;ciplined men; propo&s;ed an addre&s;s to
the King, de&s;iring that the body of marines &s;hould be
compo&s;ed of drafts from the old regiments: that as few
officers &s;hould be appointed as the nature of the ca&s;e
would permit; and he expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that the Hou&s;e
would recommend this method to his Maje&s;ty, in tender
compa&s;&s;ion to his people, already burthened with many
heavy and grievous taxes. This &s;cheme was repugnant
to the intention of the mini&s;try, who&s;e aim was to in|crea&s;e
the number of their dependents, and extend their
<PB N="34" REF="38">
parliamentary intere&s;t, by granting a great number of
commi&s;&s;ions. The propo&s;al was, therefore, after a long
debate, rejected by the majority. Motions were made for
an enquiry into the conduct of tho&s;e who concluded the
convention; but they were over-ruled. The pen&s;ion-bill
was revived, and &s;o powerfully &s;upported by the elo|quence
of Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Pulteney, and
Mr. Lyttelton, that it made its way through the Commons
to the Upper Hou&s;e, where it was again lo&s;t, upon a divi|&s;ion,
after a very long debate. As the &s;eamen of the
kingdom expre&s;&s;ed uncommon aver&s;ion to the &s;ervice of the
government, and the fleet could not be manned without
great difficulty, the mini&s;try prepared a bill, which was
brought in by Sir Charles Wager, for regi&s;tering all &s;ea|men,
watermen, fi&s;hermen, and lightermen throughout
his Maje&s;ty's dominions. Had this bill pa&s;&s;ed into a law,
a Briti&s;h &s;ailor would have been reduced to the mo&s;t abject
degree of &s;lavery: had he removed from a certain di&s;trict
allotted for the place of his re&s;idence, he would have been
deemed a de&s;erter, and puni&s;hed accordingly: he mu&s;t
have appeared, when &s;ummoned, at all hazards, whatever
might have been the circum&s;tances of his family, or the
&s;tate of his private affairs: had he been incumbered with
debt, he mu&s;t either have incurred the penalties of this
law, or lain at the mercy of his creditors: had he acquired
by indu&s;try, or received by inheritance, an ample fortune,
he would have been liable to be torn from his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,
and &s;ubjected to hard&s;hips which no man would endure
but from the &s;en&s;e of fear or indigence. The bill was &s;o
vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Sir John Barnard and others, as a
$$agrant encroachment on the liberties of the people, that
the Hou&s;e rejected it on the &s;econd reading.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. The King having by me&s;&s;age communi|cated
to the Hou&s;e his intention of di&s;po&s;ing the Prince&s;s
Mary in marriage to Prince Frederick of He&s;&s;e; and ex|pre&s;&s;ing
his hope, that the Commons would enable him
to give a &s;uitable portion to his daughter; they unanimou&s;+ly
re&s;olved to grant forty thou&s;and pounds for that purpo&s;e;
<PB N="35" REF="39">
and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s of thanks to his Maje&s;ty, for
having communicated to the Hou&s;e this intended marri|age.
On the thirteenth day of March a &s;hip arrived from
the We&s;t-Indies, di&s;patched by Admiral Vernon, with an
account of his having taken Porto-Bello, on the i&s;thmus of
Darien, with &s;ix &s;hips only, and demoli&s;hed all the forti|fications
of the place. The Spaniards acted with &s;uch
pu&s;illanimity on this occa&s;ion, that their forts were taken
almo&s;t without blood&s;hed. The two Hou&s;es of parliament
joined in an addre&s;s of congratulation upon this &s;ucce&s;s of
his Maje&s;ty's arms; and the nation in general was won|derfully
elated by an exploit which was magnified much
above its merit. The Commons granted every thing the
crown thought proper to demand. They provided for
eight-and-twenty thou&s;and land-forces, be&s;ides &s;ix thou|&s;and
marines. They enabled his Maje&s;ty to equip a very
powerful navy: they voted the &s;ub&s;idy to the King of
Denmark; and they empowered their &s;overeign to defray
certain extraordinary expen&s;es not &s;pecified in the e&s;ti|mates.
To an&s;wer the&s;e uncommon grants, they im|po&s;ed
a land-tax of four &s;hillings in the pound; and enabled
his Maje&s;ty to deduct twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds
from the &s;inking fund: in a word, the expen&s;e of the war,
during the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing year, amounted to about
four millions. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed on the twenty-ninth
day of April, when the King thanked the Com|mons
for the &s;upplies they had &s;o liberally granted, and
recommended union and moderation to both Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. During the greate&s;t part of this winter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1740.</NOTE>
the poor had been grievou&s;ly afflicted in con&s;equence of a
&s;evere fro&s;t, which began at Chri&s;tmas and continued till
the latter end of February. The river Thames was co|vered
with &s;uch a cru&s;t of ice, that a multitude of people
dwelled upon it in tents, and a great number of booths
were erected for the entertainment of the populace. The
navigation was entirely &s;topped: the watermen and fi&s;her|men
were di&s;abled from earning a livelihood: the fruits of
the earth were de&s;troyed by the cold, which was &s;o extreme,
<PB N="36" REF="40">
that many per&s;ons were chilled to death;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK. II. 1740.</NOTE> and this cala|mity
was the more deeply felt, as the poor could not afford
to &s;upply them&s;elves with coals and fuel, which were ad|vanced
in price, in proportion to the &s;everity and continu|ance
of the fro&s;t. The lower cla&s;s of labourers, who
worked in the open air, were now deprived of all means
of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: many kinds of manufacture were laid a&s;ide,
becau&s;e it was found impracticable to carry them on. The
price of all &s;orts of provi&s;ion ro&s;e almo&s;t to a dearth: even
water was &s;old in the &s;treets of London. In this
&s;ea&s;on of di&s;tre&s;s, many wretched families mu&s;t have pe|ri&s;hed
by cold and hunger, had not tho&s;e of opulent for|tunes
been in&s;pired with a remarkable &s;pirit of compa&s;&s;ion
and humanity. Nothing can more redound to the honour
of the Engli&s;h nation, than did tho&s;e in&s;tances of bene|volence
and well conducted charity which were then ex|hibited.
The liberal hand was not only opened to the pro|fe&s;&s;ed
beggar, and the poor that owned their di&s;tre&s;s: but
uncommon pains were taken to find out and relieve tho&s;e
more unhappy objects, who from motives of fal&s;e pride, or
ingenuous &s;hame, endeavoured to conceal their mi&s;ery.
The&s;e were a&s;&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t in their own de&s;pite. The
&s;olitary habitations of the widow, the fatherle&s;s, and the
unfortunate were vi&s;ited by the beneficent, who felt for
the woes of their fellow-creatures; and to &s;uch as refu&s;e to
receive a portion of the publick charity, the nece&s;&s;aries of
life were privately conveyed, in &s;uch a manner as could
lea&s;t &s;hock the delicacy of their di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. In the beginning of May, the King of Great
Britain &s;et out for Hanover, after having appointed a re|gency,
and concerted vigorous mea&s;ures for di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the
enemy. In a few days after his departure, the &s;pou&s;als of
the Prince&s;s Mary were celebrated by proxy, the Duke
of Cumberland repre&s;enting the Prince of He&s;&s;e, and in
June the Prince&s;s embarked for the continent. About
the &s;ame time, a &s;loop arrived in England with di&s;patches
from Admiral Vernon, who, &s;ince his adventure at Porto-Bello,
had bombarded Carthagena, and taken the &s;ort of
<PB N="37" REF="41">
San Lorenzo, on the river of Chagre, in the neighbour|hood
of his former conque&s;t. This month was likewi&s;e
marked by the death of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, a prince by
no means remarkable for great or amiable qualities. He
was &s;ucceeded on the throne by Frederick his elde&s;t &s;on,
the reigning king of that realm, who has &s;o eminently
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a warrior and legi&s;lator. In Au|gu&s;t
the King of Great-Britain concluded a treaty with
the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, who engaged to furni&s;h him with
a body of &s;ix thou&s;and men for four years, in con&s;ide|ration
of an annual &s;ub&s;idy of two hundred and fifty thou|&s;and
crowns.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. Mean while, preparations of war were vigo|rou&s;ly
carried on by the mini&s;try in England. They had
wi&s;ely re&s;olved to annoy the Spaniards in their American
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Three &s;hips of war crui&s;ing in the bay of
Bi&s;cay, fell in with a large Spani&s;h &s;hip of the line &s;trong|ly
manned, and took her after a very ob&s;tinate engage|ment:
but the a&s;&s;ogue &s;hips arrived, with the trea&s;ure,
in Spain, notwith&s;tanding the vigilance of the Engli&s;h
commanders, who were &s;tationed in a certain latitude to
intercept that flota. One camp was formed on Houn&s;low
heath; and &s;ix thou&s;and marines lately levied were en|camped
on the i&s;le of Wight, in order to be embarked for
the We&s;t-Indies. Intelligence being received that a
&s;trong &s;quadron of Spani&s;h &s;hips of war waited at Ferrol
for orders to &s;ail to their American &s;ettlements, Sir John
Norris &s;ailed with a powerful fleet from Spithead, to di&s;|pute
their voyage; and the Duke of Cumberland &s;erved in
per&s;on as a Volunteer in this expedition: but, after divers
fruitle&s;s efforts, he was by contrary winds obliged to lie
inactive for the greate&s;t part of the &s;ummer in Torbay;
and, upon advice that the French and Spani&s;h &s;quadrons
had &s;ailed to the We&s;t-Indies in conjunction, the de&s;ign
again&s;t Ferrol was wholly laid a&s;ide. In September, a
&s;mall &s;quadron of &s;hips, commanded by Commodore
An&s;on, &s;et &s;ail for the South-&s;ea, in order to act again&s;t
the enemy on the coa&s;t of Chili and Peru, and co-operate
<PB N="38" REF="42">
occa&s;ionally with Admiral Vernon acro&s;s the i&s;thmus of
Darien. The &s;cheme was well laid, but ruined by un|nece&s;&s;ary
delays, and unfore&s;een accidents. But the hopes
of the nation centered chiefly in a formidable armament
de&s;igned for the northern coa&s;t of New Spain, and his
Catholick Maje&s;ty's other &s;ettlements on that &s;ide of the
Atlantick. Commi&s;&s;ions had been i&s;&s;ued for rai&s;ing a re|giment
of four battalions in the Engli&s;h colonies of
North-America, that they might be tran&s;ported to Ja|maica,
and join the forces from England. The&s;e, con|&s;i&s;ting
of the marines, and detachments from &s;ome old
regiments, were embarked in October at the i&s;le of Wight,
under the command of Lord Cathcart, a nobleman of ap|proved
honour, and great experience in the art of war;
and they &s;ailed under convoy of Sir Chaloner Ogle, with a
fleet of &s;even and-twenty &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates,
fire-&s;hips, bomb-ketches, and tenders. They were likewi&s;e
furni&s;hed with ho&s;pital-&s;hips, and &s;tore-&s;hips, laden with
provi&s;ion, ammunition, all &s;orts of warlike implements, and
every kind of convenience. Never was an armament more
completely equipped; and never had the nation more rea&s;on
to hope for extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. On the twentieth day of October, Charles VI.
Emperor of Germany, the la&s;t prince of the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria, died at Vienna, and was &s;ucceeded in his here|ditary
dominions by his elde&s;t daughter, the Archduche&s;s
Maria There&s;a, married to the Grand Duke of Tu&s;cany.
Though this prince&s;s &s;ucceeded as Queen o$ Hungary, by
virtue of the pragmatic &s;anction guaranteed by all the
powers in Europe, her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion produced &s;uch conte&s;ts
as kindled a cruel war in the empire. The young King
of Pru&s;&s;ia was no &s;ooner informed of the Emperor's death,
than he entered Sile&s;ia at the head of twenty thou&s;and
men; &s;ei&s;ed certain fiefs to which his family laid claim:
and publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, declaring that he had no intention
to contravene the pragmatic &s;anction. The Elector of
Bavaria refu&s;ed to acknowledge the Archduche&s;s as Queen
of Hungary and Bohemia, alledging that he him&s;elf had
preten&s;ions to tho&s;e countries, as the de&s;cendant of the
<PB N="39" REF="43">
Emperor Ferdinand I. who was head of the German
branch of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. Charles VI. was &s;ur|vived
but a few days by his ally, the Czarina Anne I wan|owna,
who died in the forty-fifth year of her age, after
having bequeathed her crown to Iwan, or John, the in|fant
&s;on of her niece, the Prince&s;s Anne of Mecklenbourg,
who had been married to Anthony Ulrick, Duke of
Brun&s;wick Lunenburg-Bevern. She appointed the Duke
of Courland regent of the empire, and even guardian of
the young Czar, though his own parents were alive: but
this di&s;po&s;ition was not long maintained.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. The King of Great-Britain having returned
to England from his German dominions, the &s;e&s;&s;ion of
parliament was opened in November. His Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;ured
them, on this occa&s;ion, that he was determined to pro&s;e|cute
the war vigorou&s;ly, even though France &s;hould
e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of Spain, as her late conduct &s;eemed to
favour this &s;uppo&s;ition. He took notice of the Empe|ror's
death, as an event which in all likelihood would
open a new &s;cene of affairs in Europe: he, therefore,
recommended to their con&s;ideration the nece&s;&s;ary &s;up|plies
for putting the nation in &s;uch a po&s;ture that it &s;hould
have nothing to fear from any emergency. Finally, he
de&s;ired them to con&s;ider of &s;ome proper regulations for
preventing the exportation of corn, and for more effec|tual
methods to man the fleet at this conjuncture. The
Commons, after having voted an addre&s;s of thanks,
brought in a bill for prohibiting the exportation of corn
and provi&s;ions, for a limited time, out of Great-Britain,
Ireland, and the American plantations. This was a
mea&s;ure calculated to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy, who were &s;up|po&s;ed
to be in want of the&s;e nece&s;&s;aries. The French
had contracted for a very large quantity of beef and pork
in Ireland, for the u&s;e of their own and of the Spani&s;h
navy; and an embargo had been laid upon the &s;hips of
that kingdom. This bill met with a vigorous oppo&s;ition:
yet the Hou&s;e unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that his Maje&s;ty
&s;hould be addre&s;&s;ed to lay an immediate embargo upon all
<PB N="40" REF="44">
&s;hips laden with corn, grain, &s;tarch, rice, beef, pork,
and other provi&s;ions, to be exported to foreign parts.
They likewi&s;e re&s;olved that the thanks of the Hou&s;e &s;hould
be given to Vice-Admiral Vernon, for the &s;ervices he had
done to his king and country in the We&s;t-Indies. One
William Cooley was examined at the bar of the Hou&s;e,
and committed to pri&s;on, after having owned him&s;elf au|thor
of a paper intituled, &startq;Con&s;iderations upon the
embargo on provi&s;ion of victual.&endq; The performance
contained many &s;hrewd and &s;evere animadver&s;ions upon
the government, for having taken a &s;tep which, without
an&s;wering the purpo&s;e of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the enemy, would
prove a grievous di&s;couragement to trade, and ruin all the
graziers of Ireland. Notwith&s;tanding the arguments u&s;ed
in this remon&s;trance, and &s;everal petitions that were pre|&s;ented
again&s;t the corn-bill, it pa&s;&s;ed by mere dint of mi|ni&s;terial
influence. The other party endeavoured, by va|rious
motions, to &s;et on foot an enquiry into the orders,
letters, and in&s;tructions which had been &s;ent to Admi|ral
Vernon and Admiral Haddock: but all &s;uch inve&s;tiga|tions
were carefully avoided.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. A very hot conte&s;t aro&s;e from a bill which
the mini&s;try brought in under the &s;pecious title of, A bill
for the encouragement and increa&s;e of &s;eamen, and for
the better and &s;peedier manning his Maje&s;ty's fleet.
This was a revival of the oppre&s;&s;ive &s;cheme which had
been rejected in the former &s;e&s;&s;ion; a &s;heme by which
the ju&s;tices of the peace were empowered to i&s;&s;ue war|rants
to con&s;tables and headboroughs, to &s;earch by day
or night for &s;uch &s;ea-faring men as &s;hould conceal them|&s;elves
within their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions. Tho&s;e &s;earch|ers
were ve&s;ted with authority to force open doors, in
ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance; and encouraged to this violence by a
reward for every &s;eaman they &s;hould di&s;cover; while the
unhappy wretches &s;o di&s;covered were dragged into the
&s;ervice, and their names entered in a regi&s;ter to be kept at
the Navy or the Admiralty-office. Such a plan of ty|ranny
did not pa&s;s uncen&s;ured. Every exceptionable
<PB N="41" REF="45">
clau&s;e produced a warm debate, in which Sir John Bar|nard,
Mr. Pulteney, Mr. Sandys, Lord Gage, Mr. Pitt,
and Mr. Lyttelton, &s;ignalized them&s;elves nobly in de|fending
the liberties of their fellow &s;ubjects. Mr. Pitt
having expre&s;&s;ed a laudable indignation at &s;uch a large
&s;tride towards de&s;potick power, in ju&s;tification of which
nothing could be urged but the plea of nece&s;&s;ity, Mr. H.
Walpole thought proper to attack him with &s;ome per&s;onal
&s;arca&s;ms. He reflected upon his youth; and ob&s;erved
that the di&s;covery of truth was very little promoted by
pompous diction and theatrical emotion. The&s;e in&s;inua|tions
expo&s;ed him to a &s;evere reply. Mr. Pitt &s;tanding
up again, &s;aid, &startq;He would not undertake to determine
whether youth could be ju&s;tly imputed to any man as
a reproach: but he affirmed, that the wretch, who
after having &s;een the con&s;equence of repeated errors,
continues &s;till to blunder, and who&s;e age has only
added ob&s;tinacy to &s;tupidity, is &s;urely the object of
either abhorrence or contempt, and de&s;erves not that
his grey head &s;hould &s;ecure him from in&s;ults: much
more is he to be abhorred, who, as he has advanced
in age, has receded from virtue, and becomes more
wicked with le&s;s temptation; who pro&s;titutes him&s;elf
for money which he cannot enjoy; and &s;pends the
remains of his life in the ruin of his country.&endq;&mdash;Peti|tions
were pre&s;ented from the city of London, and coun|ty
of Glouce&s;ter, again&s;t the bill, as detrimental to the
trade and navigation of the kingdom, by di&s;couraging
rather than encouraging &s;ailors, and de&s;tructive to the
liberties of the &s;ubject: but they were both rejected, as
in&s;ults upon the Hou&s;e of Commons. After very long
debates, maintained on both &s;ides with extraordinary
ardour and emotion, the &s;evere clau&s;es were dropped, and
the bill pa&s;&s;ed with amendments.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. But the mo&s;t remarkable incident of this
&s;e&s;&s;ion was an open and per&s;onal attack upon the mini|&s;ter,
who was become extremely unpopular all over the
kingdom. The people were now more than ever &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="42" REF="46">
of the grievous taxes under which they groaned; and &s;aw
their burthens daily increa&s;ing. No effectual attempt
had as yet been made to annoy the enemy. Expen&s;ive
&s;quadrons had been equipped; had made excur&s;ions,
and returned without &s;triking a blow. The Spani&s;h fleet
had &s;ailed fir&s;t from Cadiz, and then from Ferrol, with|out
any interuption from Admiral Haddock, who com|manded
the Briti&s;h &s;quadron in the Mediterranean, and
who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be re&s;tricted by the in&s;tructions he
had received from the mini&s;try, though in fact his want
of &s;ucce&s;s was owing to accident. Admiral Vernon had
written from the We&s;t-Indies to his private friends, that
he was neglected, and in danger of being &s;acrificed.
Notwith&s;tanding the numerous navy which the nation
maintained, the Spani&s;h privateers made prize of the Bri|ti&s;h
merchant &s;hips with impunity. In violation of trea|ties,
and in contempt of that intimate connexion which
had been &s;o long cultivated between the French and
Engli&s;h mini&s;try, the King of France had ordered the
harbour and fortifications of Dunkirk to be repaired: his
fleet had &s;ailed to the We&s;t-Indies, in conjunction with that
of Spain; and the merchants of England began to tremble
for Jamaica: finally, commerce was in a manner &s;u&s;pend|ed,
by the practice of pre&s;&s;ing &s;ailors into the &s;ervice, and
by the embargo which had been laid upon &s;hips in all the
ports of Great Britain and Ireland. The&s;e cau&s;es of po|pular
di&s;content, added to other complaints which had
been &s;o long repeated again&s;t the mini&s;ter, exaggerated
and inculcated by his enemies with unwearied indu&s;try,
at length rendered him &s;o univer&s;ally odious, that his
name was &s;eldom or never mentioned with decency, ex|cept
by his own dependents.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. The country-party in parliament &s;ei&s;ed this
opportunity of vengeance. Mr. Sandys went up to Sir
Robert Walpole in the Hou&s;e, and told him, that on Fri|day
next he &s;hould bring a charge again&s;t him in publick.
The mini&s;ter &s;eemed to be &s;urpri&s;ed at this unexpected
intimation; but, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, thanked him politely
<PB N="43" REF="47">
for this previous notice, and &s;aid he de&s;ired no favour,
but fair play<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Upon this occa&s;ion he mi&s;quoted Horace. &startq;As I am not con&s;cions of any crime (&s;aid he) I do not doubt of being able to make a proper defence. <HI>Nil con&s;cire &s;ibi nulli palle&s;cere culpae.</HI>&endq; He was corrected by Mr. Pulteney; &startq; but in&s;i&s;ted upon his being in the right, and actually laid a wager on the ju&s;tne&s;s of his quotation.&endq;</NOTE>. Mr. Sandys, at the time which he had
appointed for this accu&s;ation, &s;tood up, and in a &s;tudied
&s;peech entered into a long deduction of the mini&s;ter's
mi&s;conduct. He in&s;i&s;ted upon the di&s;contents of the na|tion,
in con&s;equence of the mea&s;ures which had been for
many years pur&s;ued at home and abroad. He profe&s;&s;ed
his belief that there was not a gentleman in the Hou&s;e
who did not know that one &s;ingle per&s;on in the admini|&s;tration
was the chief, if not the &s;ole advi&s;er and promo|ter
of all tho&s;e mea&s;ures. &startq;This (added he) is known
without doors, as well as within; therefore, the di&s;con|tents,
the reproaches, and even the cur&s;es of the people
are all directed again&s;t that &s;ingle per&s;on. They com|plain
of pre&s;ent mea&s;ures: they have &s;uffered by pa&s;t
mea&s;ures: they expect no redre&s;s; they expect no
alteration or amendment, whil&s;t he has a &s;hare in di|recting
or advi&s;ing our future admini&s;tration. The&s;e,
Sir, are the &s;entiments of the people in regard to that
mini&s;ter: the&s;e &s;entiments we are in honour and duty
bound to repre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty; and the proper me|thod
for doing this, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by our con&s;titution,
is to addre&s;s his Maje&s;ty to remove him from his
councils.&endq; He then proceeded to explain the particulars
of the mini&s;ter's mi&s;conduct in the whole &s;eries of his ne|gociations
abroad. He charged him with having endea|voured
to &s;upport his own intere&s;t, and to erect a kind of
de&s;potick government, by the practice of corruption; with
having betrayed the intere&s;t and honour of Great-Britain
in the late convention; with having neglected to pro&s;ecute
the war again&s;t Spain; and he concluded with a motion
for an addre&s;s to the King, that he would be plea&s;ed to re|move
Sir Robert Walpole from his pre&s;ence and councils
for ever. He was an&s;wered by Mr. Pelham, who under|took
<PB N="44" REF="48">
to defend or excu&s;e all the mea&s;ures which the oth$$
had condemned; and aquitted him&s;elf as a warm frier$
and un&s;haken adherent. Again&s;t this champion Sir Jo$$
Barnard entered the li&s;ts, and was &s;u&s;tained by M$
Pulteney, who, with equal &s;pirit and preci&s;ion, point$
out and expo&s;ed all the material errors and mal-practic$
of the admini&s;tration. Sir Robert Walpole &s;poke wi$$
great temper and deliberation in behalf of him&s;elf. Wi$$
re&s;pect to the article of bribery and corruption, he &s;a$$
if any one in&s;tance had been mentioned; if it had be$$
&s;hewn that he ever offered a reward to any member $word$
either Hou&s;e, or ever threatened to deprive any memb$$
of his office or employment, in order to influence his v$$|ing
in parliament, there might have been &s;ome ground $word$
this charge; but when it was &s;o generally laid, he did n$$
know what he could &s;ay to it, unle&s;s to deny it as gen|rally
and as po&s;itively as it had been a&s;&s;erted.&mdash;Such
declaration as this, in the hearing of &s;o many per&s;ons, w$$
not only knew, but &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by his wages of corruptio$
was a &s;trong proof of the mini&s;ter's being dead to all &s;en$$
of &s;hame, and all regard to veracity. The debate was pr$|tracted
by the court members till three o'clock in t$$
morning, when above &s;ixty of the oppo&s;ite party havin$
retired, the motion was rejected by a con&s;iderable maj$|rity.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. A bill was brought in for prohibiting $word$
practice of in&s;uring &s;hips belonging to the enemies of th$
nation; but it was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Sir John Barnar$
and Mr. Willimot, who demon&s;trated that this kind$
traffick was advantageous to the kingdom; and the &s;che$$
was dropped. Another warm conte&s;t aro&s;e upon a clau$$
of the mutiny-bill relating to the quartering of &s;oldie$
upon inn-keepers and publicans, who complained of the$
being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in furni&s;hing tho&s;e gue&s;ts with provi&s;ion
and nece&s;&s;aries at the rates pre&s;cribed by law or cu&s;to$
There were not wanting advocates to expatiate upon th$
nature of this grievance, which, however, was not redre&s;&s;e$
A new trade was at this time opened with Per&s;ia, throug$
<PB N="45" REF="49">
$he dominions of the Czar, and ve&s;ted with an exclu&s;ive
privilege in the Ru&s;&s;ia company, by an act of parliament.
The Commons voted forty thou&s;and &s;eamen for the &s;ervice
of the en&s;uing year, and about thirty thou&s;and men for
$he e&s;tabli&s;hment of land-forces. They provided for the
$$b&s;idies granted to the King of Denmark and the Land|grave
of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el; and took every &s;tep which was &s;ug|ge&s;ted
for the ea&s;e and convenience of the government.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. The parties in the Hou&s;e of Lords were
influenced by the &s;ame motives which actuated the Com|mons.
The Duke of Argyle, who had by this time re&s;ign|ed
all his places, declared open war again&s;t the mini&s;try.
$n the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the King's &s;peech was no
&s;ooner reported by the Chancellor, than this nobleman
&s;tood up, and moved that a general addre&s;s of thanks
&s;hould be pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, in&s;tead of a recapitula|tion
of every paragraph of the King's &s;peech, re-echoed
from the parliament to the throne, with expre&s;&s;ions of blind
approbation, implying a general concurrence with all the
mea&s;ures of the mini&s;ter. He &s;poke on this &s;ubject with
an a&s;toni&s;hing impetuo&s;ity of eloquence, that rolled like a
river which had overflowed its banks and deluged the whole
adjacent country. The motion was &s;upported by Lord
Bathur&s;t, Lord Carteret, the Earl of Che&s;terfield, and
Lord Gower, who, though they di&s;played all the talents
of oratory, were out-voted by the oppo&s;ite party, headed
by the Duke of Newca&s;tle, the Earl of Cholmondeley,
Lord Hervey, and the Lord Chancellor. The motion
was rejected, and the addre&s;s compo&s;ed in the u&s;ual &s;train.
The &s;ame motions for an enquiry into orders and in&s;truc|tions,
which had mi&s;carried in the Lower Hou&s;e, were
here repeated with the &s;ame bad &s;ucce&s;s: in the debates
which en&s;ued, the young Earls of Hallifax and Sandwich
acquired a con&s;iderable &s;hare of reputation, for the &s;trength
of argument and elocution with which they contended
again&s;t the adherents of the mini&s;try. When the Hou&s;e
took into con&s;ideration the &s;tate of the army, the Duke of
Argyle having harangued with equal &s;kill and energy on
<PB N="46" REF="50">
military affairs, propo&s;ed that the forces &s;hould be augment|ed
by adding new levies to the old companies, without in|crea&s;ing
the number of officers; as &s;uch an augmentation
&s;erved only to deba&s;e the dignity of the &s;ervice, by rai&s;ing
the lowe&s;t of mankind to the rank of gentlemen; and to
extend the influence of the mini&s;ter, by multiplying his de|pendents.
He, therefore, moved for a re&s;olution, that the
augmenting the army by rai&s;ing regiments, as it is the mo&s;t
unnece&s;&s;ary and mo&s;t expen&s;ive method of augmentation,
was al&s;o the mo&s;t dangerous to the liberties of the nation.
This propo&s;al was likewi&s;e over-ruled, after a &s;hort though
warm contention. This was the fate of all the other moti|ons
made by the lords in the oppo&s;ition, though the victory
of the courtiers was always clogged with a nervous and &s;pirit|ed
prote&s;t. Two days were expended in the debate produ|ced
by Lord Carteret's motion for an addre&s;s, be&s;eeching his
Maje&s;ty to remove Sir Robert Walpole from his pre&s;ence
and councils for ever. The &s;peech that u&s;hered in this
memorable motion would not have di&s;graced a Cicero. It
contained a retro&s;pect of all the publick mea&s;ures which
had been pur&s;ued &s;ince the Revolution. It explained the
nature of every treaty, whether right or wrong, which had
been concluded under the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration. It de|&s;cribed
the political connections &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the dif|ferent
powers in Europe. It expo&s;ed the weakne&s;s, the
mi&s;conduct, and the iniquity of the mini&s;ter, both in his
foreign and dome&s;tick tran&s;actions. It was embelli&s;hed
with all the ornaments of rhetorick, and warmed with a
noble &s;pirit of patriot indignation. The Duke of Argyle,
Lord Bathur&s;t, and his other colleagues, &s;eemed to be ani|mated
with uncommon &s;ervour, and even in&s;pired, by the
&s;ubject.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1741.</NOTE> A man of imagination, in reading their &s;peeches,
will think him&s;elf tran&s;ported into the Roman &s;enate, be|fore
the ruin of that republick. Neverthele&s;s, the mini&s;ter
&s;till triumphed by dint of numbers; though his victory
was dearly purcha&s;ed. Thirty peers entered a vigorous
prote&s;t; and Walpole's character &s;u&s;tained &s;uch a rude
&s;hock from this oppo&s;ition, that his authority &s;eemed to be
<PB N="47" REF="51">
drawing near a period. Immediately after this conte&s;t was
decided, the Duke of Marlborough moved for a re&s;olution,
that any attempt to inflict any kind of puni&s;hment on any
per&s;on, without allowing him an opportunity to make his
defence, or without any proof of any crime or mi&s;demea|nour
committed by him, is contrary to natural ju&s;tice, the
fundamental laws of the realm, and the ancient e&s;tabli&s;hed
u&s;age of parliament; and is a high infringement of the li|berties
of the &s;ubject. It was &s;econded by the Duke of
Devon&s;hire and Lord Lovel; and oppo&s;ed by Lord Gower,
as an intended cen&s;ure on the proceedings of the day.
This &s;entiment was &s;o warmly e&s;pou&s;ed by Lord Talbot,
who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the former debate, that he
&s;eemed to be tran&s;ported beyond the bounds of moderation.
He was interrupted by the Earl of Cholomondeley, who
charged him with having violated the order and decorum
which ought to be pre&s;erved in &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly. His
pa&s;&s;ion was inflamed by this rebuke: he declared him&s;elf
an independent lord; a character which he would not for|feit
for the &s;miles of a court, the profit of an employ|ment,
or the reward of a pen&s;ion: he &s;aid when he was
engaged on the &s;ide of truth, he would trample on the
in&s;olence that &s;hould command him to &s;uppre&s;s his &s;en|timents.
&mdash;On a divi&s;ion, however, the motion was car|ried.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. In the beginning of April, the King
repairing to the Hou&s;e of Peers, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome acts that
were ready for the royal a&s;&s;ent. Then, in his &s;peech to
both Hou&s;es, he gave them to under&s;tand, that the Queen
of Hungary had made requi&s;ition of the twelve thou&s;and
men &s;tipulated by treaty; and that he had ordered the
&s;ub&s;idy-troops of Denmark and He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el to be in rea|dine&s;s
to march to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He ob&s;erved, that in
this complicated and uncertain &s;tate of affairs, many in|cidents
might ari&s;e, and render it nece&s;&s;ary for him to
incur extraordinary expen&s;es for maintaining the pragma|tick-&s;anction,
at a time when he could not po&s;&s;ibly have
<PB N="48" REF="52">
recour&s;e to the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his parliament.
He, therefore, demanded of the Commons &s;uch a &s;upply
as might be requi&s;ite for the&s;e ends; and promi&s;ed to ma|nage
it with all po&s;&s;ible frugality. The Lower Hou&s;e
in their addre&s;s, approved of all his mea&s;ures; declared
they would effectually &s;upport him again&s;t all in&s;ults and
attacks that might be made upon any of his territories
though not belonging to the crown of Great-Britain$
and that they would enable him to contribute, in the
mo&s;t effectual manner, to the &s;upport of the Queen o$
Hungary. Sir Robert Walpole moved, that an aid o$
two hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be granted to that
prince&s;s. Mr. Shippen prote&s;ted again&s;t any interpo&s;i|tion
in the affairs of Germany. He expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;like
of the promi&s;e which had been made to defend his Ma|je&s;ty's
foreign dominions; a promi&s;e, in his opinion, in|con&s;i&s;tent
with that important and inviolable law, the
act of &s;ettlement; a promi&s;e which, could it have been
foreknown, would perhaps have for ever precluded from
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion that illu&s;trious family to which the nation
owed &s;uch numberle&s;s ble&s;&s;ings, &s;uch continued felicity
The motion however pa&s;&s;ed, though not without further
oppo&s;ition; and the Hou&s;e re&s;olved, that three hundred
thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be granted to his Maje&s;ty, to
enable him effectually to &s;upport the Queen of Hungary.
Towards the expen&s;e of this year, a million was deducted
from the &s;inking fund; and the land tas continued at
four &s;hillings in the pound. The preparations for this
war had already co&s;t five millions. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed
on the twenty-fifth day of April, when the King took
his leave of this parliament, with warm expre&s;&s;ions of
tenderne&s;s and &s;atisfaction. Henry Bromley, Stephen
Fox, and John Howe, three members of the Lower
Hou&s;e, who had &s;ignalized them&s;elves in defence of the
mini&s;ter, were now ennobled, and created barons of
Montford, Ilche&s;ter, and Chedworth. A camp was
formed near Colche&s;ter; and the King having appoint|ed
<PB N="49" REF="53">
a regency, &s;et out in May for his German domi|nions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir William Wyndham died in the preceding year, deeply regretted as an orator, a patriot, and a man, the con&s;tant a&s;&s;ertor of Briti&s;h liberty, and one of the chief ornaments of the Engli&s;h nation. In the cour&s;e of
the &s;ame year, General Oglethorpe, governor of Georgia, had, with &s;ome
&s;uccours obtained from the colony of Carolina, and a &s;mall &s;quadron of the King's &s;hips, made an attempt upon fort Augu&s;tine, the capital of Spani&s;h Florida; and actually reduced &s;ome &s;mall &s;orts in the neighbour|hood of the place: but the Carolinians withdrawing in di&s;gu&s;t, di&s;&s;enti|ons prevailing among the &s;ea officers, the hurricane months approaching, and the enemy, having received a &s;upply and re-enforcement, he abandon|ed the enterpri&s;e, and returned to Georgia.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>&sect; I. THE Briti&s;h armament had by this time pro|ceeded
to action in the We&s;t-Indies. Sir
Chaloner Ogle, who &s;ailed from Spithead, had been over|taken
by a tempe&s;t in the bay of Bi&s;cay, by which the
fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of about one hundred and &s;eventy &s;ail,
were &s;catterd and di&s;per&s;ed. Neverthele&s;s, he pro&s;ecuted
his voyage, and anchored with a view to provide wood
and water, in the neutral i&s;land of Dominica, where the
intended expedition &s;u&s;tained a terrible &s;hock in the death
of the gallant Lord Cathcart, who was carried off by a
dy&s;entery. The lo&s;s of this nobleman was the more &s;e|verely
felt, as the command of the land-forces devolved
upon General Wentworth, an officer without experience,
authority, and re&s;olution. As the fleet &s;ailed along the
i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola, in its way to Jamaica, four large
&s;hips of war were di&s;covered; and Sir Chaloner detached
an equal number of his &s;quadron to give them cha&s;e,
while he him&s;elf proceeded on his voyage. As tho&s;e
&s;trange &s;hips refu&s;ed to bring to, Lord Augu&s;tus Fitzroy,
the commodore of the four Briti&s;h &s;hips, &s;aluted one of
them with a broad&s;ide, and a &s;mart engagement en&s;ued.
After they had fought during the be&s;t part of the night, the
<PB N="52" REF="56">
enemy hoi&s;ted their colours in the morning, and appeared
to be part of the French &s;quadron, which had &s;ailed from
Europe under the command of the Marquis d'Antin, with
orders to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Spani&s;h admiral, De Torres, in at|tacking
and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the Engli&s;h &s;hips and colonies.
War was not yet declared between France and England;
therefore ho&s;tilities cea&s;ed: the Engli&s;h and French com|manders
complimented each other; excu&s;ed them&s;elves
mutually, for the mi&s;take which had happened; and part|ed
as friends, with a con&s;iderable lo&s;s of men on both
&s;ides.</P>
<P>&sect; II. In the mean time Sir Chaloner Ogle arrived at
Jamaica, where he joined Vice-Admiral Vernon, who now
found him&s;elf at the head of the mo&s;t formidable fleet and
army that ever vi&s;ited tho&s;e &s;eas, with full power to act at
di&s;cretion. The conjoined &s;quadrons con&s;i&s;ted of nine-and-twenty
&s;hips of the line, with almo&s;t an equal number
of frigates, fire&s;hips, and bomb-ketches, well manned, and
plentifully &s;upplied with all kinds of provi&s;ions, &s;tores, and
nece&s;&s;aries. The number of &s;eamen amounted to fifteen
thou&s;and: that of the land-forces, including the American
regiment of four battalions, and a body of negroes inli&s;ted
at Jamaica, did not fall &s;hort of twelve thou&s;and. Had
this armament been ready to act in the proper &s;ea&s;on of the
year, under the conduct of wi&s;e, experienced officers, united
in councils, and &s;teadily attached to the intere&s;t and honour
of their country, the Havannah, and whole i&s;land of Cuba,
might have been ea&s;ily reduced: the whole trea&s;ure of the
Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies would have been intercepted; and
Spain mu&s;t have been humbled into the mo&s;t abject &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion.
But &s;everal unfavourable circum&s;tances concurred
to fru&s;trate the hopes of the publick. The mini&s;try had
detained Sir Chaloner Ogle at Spithead, without any vi&s;ible
cau&s;e, until the &s;ea&s;on for action was almo&s;t exhau&s;ted:
for, on the continent of New Spain, the periodical rains
begin about the end of April; and this change in the at|mo&s;phere
is always attended with epidemical di&s;tempers,
which render the climate extremely unhealthy: be&s;ides,
<PB N="53" REF="57">
the rain is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that for the &s;pace of two months
no army can keep the field.</P>
<P>&sect; III. Sir Chaloner Ogle arrived at Jamaica on the
ninth day of January; and Admiral Vernon did not &s;ail
on his intended expedition till towards the end of the
month. In&s;tead of directing his cour&s;e to the Havannah,
which lay to leeward, and might have been reached in
le&s;s than three days, he re&s;olved to beat up again&s;t the
wind to Hi&s;paniola, in order to ob&s;erve the motion of the
French &s;quadron, commanded by the Marquis d'Antin.
The fifteenth day of February had elap&s;ed before he re|ceived
certain information that the French admiral had
&s;ailed for Europe in great di&s;tre&s;s, for want of men and
provi&s;ions, which he could not procure in the We&s;t-Indies.
Admiral Vernon, thus di&s;appointed, called a council of
war, in which it was determined to proceed for Cartha|gena.
The fleet being &s;upplied with wood and water
at Hi&s;paniola, &s;et &s;ail for the continent of New-Spain, and
on the fourth of March anchored in Playa Grande, to the
windward of Carthagena. Admiral de Torres had already
&s;ailed to the Havannah: but Carthagena was &s;trongly for|tified,
and the garri&s;on re-enforced by the crews of a
&s;mall &s;quadron of large &s;hips, commanded by Don Blas
de Le&s;o, an officer of experience and reputation. Here
the Engli&s;h Admiral lay inactive till the ninth, when the
troops were landed on the i&s;land of Tierra Bomba, near
the mouth of the harbour, known by the name of Boca|chica,
or Little-mouth, which was &s;urpri&s;ingly fortified
with ca&s;tles, batteries, booms, chains, cables, and &s;hips
of war. The Briti&s;h forces erected a battery on &s;hore,
with which they made a breach in the principal fort, while
the Admiral &s;ent in a number of &s;hips to divide the fire of
the enemy, and co-operative with the endeavours of the
army. Lord Aubrey Beauclerc, a gallant officer, who
commanded one of the&s;e &s;hips, was &s;lain on this occa&s;ion,
The breach being deemed practicable, the forces advance|ed
to the attack: but the forts and batteries were abandon|ed:
the Spani&s;h &s;hips that lay athwart the harbour's mouth
<PB N="54" REF="58">
were de&s;troyed or taken: the pa&s;&s;age was opened, and the
fleet entered without further oppo&s;ition. Then the forces
were re-embarked with the artillery, and landed within a
mile of Carthagena, where they were oppo&s;ed by about
&s;even hundred Spaniards, whom they obliged to retire.
The admiral and general had contracted a hearty contempt
for each other, and took all opportunities of expre&s;&s;ing
their mutual di&s;like: far from acting vigorou&s;ly in concert,
for the advantage of the community, they maintained a
mutual re&s;erve, and &s;eparate cabals; and each proved more
eager for the di&s;grace of his rival, than zealous for the
honour of the nation.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. The general complained that the fleet lay
idle, while his troops lay harra&s;&s;ed and dimiui&s;hed
by hard duty and di&s;temper. The admiral affirmed
that his &s;hips could not lie near enough to batter
the town of Carthagena: he upbraided the general with
inactivity and want of re&s;olution to attack the fort of St.
Lazar, which commanded the town, and might be taken
by &s;calade. Wentworth, &s;timulated by the&s;e reproaches,
re&s;olved to try the experiment. His forces marched up
to the attack: but the guides being &s;lain, they mi&s;took
their route, and advanced to the &s;tronge&s;t part of the for|tification,
where they were moreover expo&s;ed to the fire
of the town. Colonel Grant, who commanded the gre|nadiers,
was mortally wounded: the &s;caling-ladders were
&s;ound too &s;hort: the officers were perplexed for want of
orders and directions: yet the &s;oldiers &s;u&s;tained a &s;evere
fire for &s;everal hours with &s;urpri&s;ing intrepidity, and at
length retreated, leaving about &s;ix hundred killed or
wounded on the &s;pot. Their number was now &s;o much
reduced, that they could no longer maintain their footing
on &s;hore: be&s;ides, the rainy &s;ea&s;on had begun with &s;uch
violence, as rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for them to live in
camp. They were, therefore, re-embarked: and all hope
of further &s;ucce&s;s immediately vani&s;hed. The admiral,
however, in order to demon&s;trate the impracticability of
taking the place by &s;ea, &s;ent in the Gallicia, one of the
<PB N="55" REF="59">
Spani&s;h &s;hips which had been taken at Boca-chica, to can|nonade
the town, with &s;ixteen guns mounted on one &s;ide,
like a floating battery. This ve&s;&s;el, manned by detach|ments
of volunteers from different &s;hips, and commanded
by Captain Hore, was warped into the inner harbour, and
moored before day, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the
walls, in very &s;hallow water. In this po&s;ition &s;he &s;tood
the fire of &s;everal batteries for &s;ome hours, without doing
or &s;u&s;taining much damage: then the admiral ordered the
men to be brought off in boats, and the cables to be cut;
&s;o that &s;he drove with the &s;ea-breeze upon a &s;hoal, where
&s;he was &s;oon filled with water. The exploit was ab&s;urd,
and the inference which the admiral drew from it altoge|ther
fallacious. He &s;aid it plainly proved, that there was
not depth of water in the inner harbour, &s;ufficient to admit
large &s;hips near enough to batter the town, with any pro|&s;pect
of &s;ucce&s;s. This, indeed, was the ca&s;e in that part of
the harbour to which the Gallicia was conducted: but a lit|tle
farther to the left, he might have &s;tationed four or five
of his large&s;t &s;hips a-brea&s;t, within pi&s;tol-&s;hot of the walls;
and if this &s;tep had been taken, when the land forces
marched to the attack of St. Lazar, in all probability the
town would have been &s;urrendered.</P>
<P>&sect; V. After the re-embarkation of the troops, the di&s;tem|pers
peculiar to the climate and &s;ea&s;on began to rage with
redoubled fury; and great numbers of tho&s;e who e&s;caped
the vengeance of the enemy peri&s;hed by a more painful
and inglorious fate. Nothing was heard but complaints
and execrations: the groans of the dying, and the &s;ervice
for the dead: nothing was &s;een but objects of woe, and
images of dejection. The conductors of this unfortunate
expedition agreed in nothing but the expediency of a &s;peedy
retreat from this &s;cene of mi&s;ery and di&s;grace. The for|tifications
of the harbour were demoli&s;hed, and the flect
returned to Jamaica. The mi&s;carriage of this expedition,
which had co&s;t the nation an immen&s;e &s;um of money, was
no &s;ooner known in England, than the kingdom was filled
with murmurs and di&s;content, and the people were
<PB N="56" REF="60">
depre&s;&s;ed, in proportion to that &s;anguine hope by which
they had been elevated. Adm. Vernon, in&s;tead of under|taking
any enterpri&s;e which might have retrieved the ho|nour
of the Briti&s;h arms, &s;et &s;ail from Jamaica with the
forces in July, and anchored at the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of Cuba,
in a bay, on which he be&s;towed the appellation of Cum|berland
harbour. The troops were landed, and encamped
at the di&s;tance of twenty miles farther up the river,
where they remained totally inactive, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted chiefly
on &s;alt and damaged provi&s;ions, till the month of Novem|ber,
when, being con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by &s;ickne&s;s,
they were put on board again, and re-conveyed to Jamai|ca.
He was afterwards re-enforced from England by four
&s;hips of war, and about three thou&s;and &s;oldiers: but he
performed nothing worthy of the reputation he had ac|quired;
and the people began to perceive that they had
mi&s;taken his character.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. The affairs on the continent of Europe were
now more than ever embroiled. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia
had demanded of the court of Vienna part of Sile&s;ia,
by virtue of old treaties of co-fraternity, which were
either ob&s;olete or annulled; and promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the
Queen with all his forces, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould comply with
his demand; but this being rejected with di&s;dain, he en|tered
Sile&s;ia at the head of an army, and pro&s;ecuted his
conque&s;ts with great rapidity. In the mean time, the
Queen o$ Hungary was crowned at Pre&s;burg, after hav|ing
&s;igned a capitulation, by which the liberties of that
kingdom were confirmed; and the Grand Duke her con|&s;ort
was, at her reque&s;t, a&s;&s;ociated with her for ten years
in the government. At the &s;ame time the &s;tates of Hun|gary
refu&s;ed to receive a memorial from the Elector of
Bavaria. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty
made his publick entrance into Bre&s;lau, and confirmed
all the privileges of the inhabitants. One of his generals
&s;urpri&s;ed the town and fortre&s;s of Jablunka, on the con|fines
of Hungary: Prince Leopold of Anhalt-De&s;&s;au,
who commanded another army, which formed the block|ade
<PB N="57" REF="61">
of Great Glogau on the Oder, took the place by
scalade, made the Generals Wallis and Rey&s;ki pri&s;oners,
with a thou&s;and men that were in garri&s;on: here, like|wi&s;e,
the victor found the military che&s;t, fifty pieces of
bra&s;s cannon, and a great quantity of ammunition.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The Queen of Hungary had &s;ollicited the ma|ritime
powers for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but found them fearful and
backward. Being obliged, therefore, to exert her&s;elf with
the more vigour, &s;he ordered Count Neuperg to a&s;&s;emble
a body of forces, and endeavour to &s;top the progre&s;s of the
Pru&s;&s;ians in Sile&s;ia. The two armies encountered each
other in the neighbourhood of Nei&s;s, at a village called
Molwitz; and, after an ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, the Au&s;trians,
were obliged to retire, with the lo&s;s of four thou&s;and men
killed, wounded, or taken. The advantage was dearly
purcha&s;ed by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. His kin&s;man, Frederick
Margrave of Brandenburgh, and Lieutenant-General
Schuylemberg were killed in the engagement, together
with a great number of general officers, and about two
thou&s;and &s;oldiers. After this action, Brieg was &s;urrender|ed
to the Pru&s;&s;ians, and he forced the important pa&s;s of
Fryewalde, which was defended by four thou&s;and Au&s;trian
hu&s;&s;ars. The Engli&s;h and Dutch mini&s;ters, who accom|panied
him in his progre&s;s, &s;pared no pains to effect an ac|commodation:
but the two &s;overeigns were too much irri|tated
again&s;t each other, to acquie&s;ce in any terms that
could be propo&s;ed. The Queen of Hungary was incen&s;ed
to find her&s;elf attacked, in the day of her di&s;tre&s;s, by a
prince to whom &s;he had given no &s;ort of provocation; and
his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty charged the court of Vienna with a
de&s;ign either to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate, or carry him off by treachery:
a de&s;ign which was di&s;owned with expre&s;&s;ions of indigna|tion
and disdain. Count Neuperg being obliged to abandon
Sile&s;ia, in order to oppo&s;e the Bavarian arms in Bohemia,
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;ent thither a detachment to join the
Elector, under the command of Count De&s;lau, who, in his
route, reduced Glatz and Nei&s;s, almo&s;t without oppo&s;ition:
then his ma&s;ter received the homage of the Sile&s;ian &s;tates
<PB N="58" REF="62">
at Bre&s;law, and returned to Berlin. I$ December, the
Pru&s;&s;ian army was di&s;tributed in winter-quarters in Mora|via,
after having taken Olmutz, the capital of that pro|vince;
and in March his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty formed a camp
of ob&s;ervation in the neighbourhood of Magdeburg.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The Elector of Hanover was alarmed at the
&s;ucce&s;s of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, in apprehen&s;ion that he
would become too formidable a neighbour. A &s;cheme was
&s;aid to have been propo&s;ed to the court of Vienna, for at|tacking
that prince's electoral dominions, and dividing the
conque&s;t: but it never was put in execution. Neverthe|le&s;s,
the troops of Hanover were augmented: the auxiliary
Danes and He&s;&s;ians in the pay of Great-Britain were or|dered
to be in readine&s;s to march; and a good number of
Briti&s;h forces encamped and prepared for embarkation.
The &s;ub&s;idy of three hundred thou&s;and pounds, granted
by parliament, was remitted to the Queen of Hungary;
and every thing &s;eemed to pre&s;age the vigorous interpo&s;i|tion
of his Britannick Maje&s;ty. But in a little time after
his arrival at Hanover, that &s;pirit of action &s;eemed to flag,
even while her Hungarian Maje&s;ty tottered on the verge of
ruin. France re&s;olved to &s;ei&s;e this opportunity of cru&s;hing
the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. In order to intimidate the Elector
of Hanover, Mare&s;chal Mallebois was &s;ent with a nume|rous
army into We&s;tphalia; and this expedient proved
effectual. A treaty of neutrality was concluded; and the
King of Great-Britain engaged to vote for the Elector of
Bavaria at the en&s;uing election of an emperor. The de&s;ign
of the French court was to rai&s;e this prince to the Impe|rial
dignity, and furni&s;h him with &s;uch &s;uccours as &s;hould
enable him to deprive the Queen of Hungary of her here|ditary
dominions.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. While the French mini&s;ter at Vienna endea|voured
to amu&s;e the Queen with the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances
of his ma&s;ter's friend&s;hip, a body of five-and-thirty thou|&s;and
men began their march for Germany, in order to join
the Elector of Bavaria: another French army was a&s;&s;em|bled
upon the Rhine; and the Count de Bellei&s;le being
<PB N="59" REF="63">
provided with large &s;ums of money, was &s;ent to negociate
with different electors. Having thus &s;ecured a majority
of voices, he proceeded to Munich, where he pre&s;ented the
Elector of Bavaria with a commi&s;&s;ion, appointing him gene|rali&s;&s;imo
of the French troops marching to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance;
and now the treaty of Nymphenburg was concluded. The
French King engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Elector with his whole
power, towards rai&s;ing him to the Imperial throne: the
Elector promi&s;ed, that after his elevation he would never
attempt to recover any of the towns or provinces of the
empire which France had conquered: that he would, in his
Imperial capacity, renounce the barrier-treaty; and agree
that France &s;hould irrevocably retain whatever places &s;he
&s;hould &s;ubdue in the Au&s;trian Netherlands. The next
&s;tep of Bellei&s;le was to negociate another treaty between
France and Pru&s;&s;ia, importing, That the Elector of Bavaria
&s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s Bohemia, Upper Au&s;tria, and the Tyrole&s;e:
That the King of Poland &s;hould be gratified with Moravia
and UpperSile&s;ia; and that his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty &s;hould retain
Lower Sile&s;ia, with the town of Nei&s;s and the county of
Glatz. The&s;e precautions being taken, the Count de
Bellei&s;le repaired to Franckfort, in quality of amba&s;&s;ador
and plenipotentiary from France, at the Imperial diet of
election. It was in this city that the French King pub|li&s;hed
a declaration, &s;ignifying, that as the King of Great-Britain
had a&s;&s;embled an army to influence the approaching
election of an emperor, his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, as
guarantee of the treaty of We&s;tphalia, had ordered &s;ome
troops to advance towards the Rhine, with a view to main|tain
the tranquillity of the Germanick body, and &s;ecure the
freedom of the Imperial election.</P>
<P>&sect; X. In July, the Elector of Bavaria, being joined by
the French forces under Mare&s;chal Broglio, &s;urpri&s;ed the
imperial city of Pa&s;&s;au, upon the Danube: and entering
Upper Au&s;tria, at the head of &s;eventy thou&s;and men, took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lintz, where he received the homage of the
&s;tates of that country. Under&s;tanding that the garri&s;on of
Vienna was very numerous, and that Count Pal&s;i had
<PB N="60" REF="64">
a&s;&s;embled thirty thou&s;and Hungarians in the neighbour|hood
of this capital, he made no farther progre&s;s in Au&s;tria,
but marched into Bohemia, where he was re-enforced by a
con&s;iderable body of Saxons, under the command of Coun$
Rutow&s;ki, natural &s;on to the late King of Poland. By
this time his Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty had acceded to the treaty o$
Nymphenburg, and declared war again&s;t the Queen of
Hungary, on the mo&s;t frivolous pretences. The Electo$
of Bavaria advanced to Prague, which was taken in the
night by &s;calade: an atchievement in which Maurice Coun$
of Saxe, another natural &s;on of the King of Poland, di&s;|tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf at the head of the French forces. In
December the Elector of Bavaria made his public entry
into this capital, where he was proclaimed King o$
Bohemia, and inaugurated with the u&s;ual &s;olemnities: the$
he &s;et out for Franckfort, to be pre&s;ent at the diet o$
election.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. At this period the Queen of Hungary &s;aw her&s;e$
abandoned by all her allies, and &s;eemingly devoted to de$
&s;truction. She was not, however, for&s;aken by her courage
nor de&s;titute of good officers, and an able mini&s;try. She
retired to Pre&s;burgh, and in a pathetick Latin &s;peech to the
&s;tates, expre&s;&s;ed her confidence in the loyalty and valour o$
her Hungarian &s;ubjects. The nobility of that kingdom
touched with her pre&s;ence and di&s;tre&s;s, a&s;&s;ured her unani|mou&s;ly,
that they would &s;acrifice their lives and fortune$
in her defence. The ban being rai&s;ed, that brave people
crowded to her &s;tandard; and the diet expre&s;&s;ed their re|&s;entment
again&s;t her enemy by a public edict, excluding
for ever the electoral hou&s;e of Bavaria from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
to the crown of Hungary: yet, without the &s;ub&s;idy &s;he
received from Great-Britain, their courage and attachment
would have proved ineffectual. By this &s;upply &s;he was
enabled to pay her army, erect magazines, complete her
warlike preparations, and put her &s;trong places in a po&s;ture
of defence. In December her generals, Berenclau and
Mentzel, defeated Count Thoring, who commanded eight
thou&s;and men, at the pa&s;s of Scardingen, and opening
<PB N="61" REF="65">
their way into Bavaria, laid the whole country under con|tribution;
while Count Khevenhuller retook the city of
Lintz, and drove the French troops out of Au&s;tria. The
Grand Signor a&s;&s;ured the Queen of Hungary, that far from
taking advantage of her troubles, he &s;hould &s;ei&s;e all oppor|tunities
to convince her of his friend&s;hip: the Pope per|mitted
her to levy a tenth on the revenues of the clergy
within her dominions; and even to u&s;e all the church-plate
for the &s;upport of the war.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. As the Czarina expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to a&s;&s;i&s;t
this unfortunate prince&s;s, the French court re&s;olved to find
her employment in another quarter. They had already
gained over to their intere&s;t Count Gyllenburg, prime|mini&s;ter
and pre&s;ident of the chancery in Sweden. A di&s;|pute
happening between him and Mr. Burnaby, the
Briti&s;h re&s;ident at Stockholm, &s;ome warm altercation pa&s;|&s;ed
Mr. Burnaby was forbid the court, and publi&s;hed a
memorial in his own vindication: on the other hand, the
King of Sweden ju&s;tified his conduct in a re&s;cript &s;ent to
all the foreign mini&s;ters. The King of Great-Britain had
propo&s;ed a &s;ub&s;idy-treaty to Sweden, which, from the in|fluence
of French councils, was rejected. The Swedes
having a&s;&s;embled a numerous army in Finland, and equip|ped
a large &s;quadron of &s;hips, declared war again&s;t Ru&s;&s;ia,
upon the mo&s;t trifling pretences; and the fleet putting to
&s;ea, commenced ho&s;tilities by blocking up the Ru&s;&s;ian
$ports in Livonia. A body of eleven thou&s;and Swedes,
commanded by General Wrangel, having advanced to
Willmen&s;trand, were in Augu&s;t attacked and defeated by
General La&s;ci, at the head of thirty thou&s;and Ru&s;&s;ians.
Count Lewenhaupt, who commanded the main army of
the Swedes, re&s;olved to take vengeance for this di&s;grace,
after the Ru&s;&s;ian troops had retired into winter-quarters.
In December he marched towards Wybourg: but, receiv|ing
letters from the Prince of He&s;&s;e-Homburgh, and the
Marquis de la Chetardie, the French amba&s;&s;ador at Peter&s;|burgh,
informing him of the &s;urpri&s;ing revolution which
had ju&s;t happened in Ru&s;&s;ia, and propo&s;ing a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of
<PB N="62" REF="66">
ho&s;tilities, he retreated with his army, in order to wait for
further in&s;tructions; and the two courts agreed to a ce&s;&s;a|tion
of arms for three months.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. The Ru&s;&s;ians had been for &s;ome time di&s;con|tented
with their government. The late Czarina was in|fluenced
chiefly by German councils, and employed a great
number of foreigners in her &s;ervice. The&s;e cau&s;es of di&s;|content
produced factions and con&s;piracies; and when they
were di&s;covered, the Empre&s;s treated the authors of them
with &s;uch &s;everity as increa&s;ed the general di&s;affection.
Be&s;ides, they were di&s;plea&s;ed at the manner in which &s;he
had &s;ettled the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The Prince of Brun&s;wick-Lunenburgh-Bevern, father to the young Czar, was not
at all agreeable to the Ru&s;&s;ian nobility, and his consort, the
Prince&s;s Anne of Mecklenburgh, having a&s;&s;umed the reins
of government during her &s;on's minority, &s;eemed to follow
the maxims of her aunt, the late Czarina. The Ru&s;&s;ian
grandees and generals, therefore, turned their eyes upon
the Prince&s;s Eli&s;abeth, who was daughter to Peter the
Great, and the darling of the empire. The French am|ba&s;&s;ador
gladly concurred in a project for depo&s;ing a prin|ce&s;s
who was well affected to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. General
La&s;ci approved of the de&s;ign, which was chiefly conducted
by the Prince of He&s;&s;e-Homburgh, who, in the reigns of
the Empre&s;s Catharine and Peter II. had been generali&s;&s;i|mo
of the Ru&s;&s;ian army. The good will and concurrence
of the troops being &s;ecured, two regiments of guards took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the avenues of the imperial palace at Pe|ter&s;burgh.
The Prince&s;s Eli&s;abeth, putting her&s;elf at the
head of one thou&s;and men, on the fifth day of December
entered the winter-palace, where the Prince&s;s of Mecklen|burgh
and the infant Czar re&s;ided. She advanced into the
chamber where the Prince&s;s and her consort lay and de&s;ired
them to ri&s;e, and quit the palace, adding, that their persons
were &s;afe; and that they could not ju&s;tly blame her for
a&s;&s;erting her right. At the &s;ame time, the Counts O&s;ter|man,
Golofkin, Mingden, and Munich were arre&s;ted:
their papers and effects were &s;ei&s;ed, and their per&s;ons
<PB N="63" REF="67">
conveyed to Schli&s;&s;elbourg, a fortre&s;s on the Neva. Early
in the morning the &s;enate a&s;&s;embling, declared all that
had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the reign of Peter II. to be u&s;urpation;
and that the imperial dignity belonged of right to the
Prince&s;s Elisabeth: &s;he was immediately proclaimed Em|pre&s;s
of all the Ru&s;&s;ias, and recognized by the army in
Finland. She forthwith publi&s;hed a general act of indem|nity:
&s;he created the Prince of He&s;&s;e-Homburgh general|$i&s;&s;imo
of her armies: &s;he re&s;tored the Dolgorucky family
to their honours and e&s;tates: &s;he recalled and rewarded
all tho&s;e who had been bani&s;hed for favouring her preten|&s;ions:
&s;he mitigated the exile of the Duke of Courland,
by indulging him with a maintenance more &s;uitable to his
rank: &s;he relea&s;ed General Wrangel, Count Wa&s;aburg,
and the other Swedi&s;h officers, who had been taken at the
battle of Willmen&s;trand: and the Prince&s;s Anne of Meck|lenburgh,
with her con&s;ort and children, were &s;ent under
a &s;trong guard, to Riga, the capital of Livonia.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. Amid&s;t the&s;e tempe&s;ts of war and revolution,
the States-General wi&s;ely determined to pre&s;erve their own
tranquillity. It was, doubtle&s;s, their intere&s;t to avoid the
dangers and expen&s;e of a war, and to profit by that &s;tag|mation
of commerce which would nece&s;&s;arily happen
among their neighbours that were at open enmity with
each other: be&s;ides, they were over-awed by the declarati|ons
of the French monarch on one &s;ide; by the power,
activity, and preten&s;ions of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty on the
other; and they dreaded the pro&s;pect of a Stadtholder at
the head of their army. The&s;e at lea&s;t were the &s;entiments
of many Dutch patriots, re-enforced by others that acted
under French influence. But the Prince of Orange num|bered
among his parti&s;ans and adherents many per&s;ons of
dignity and credit in the commonwealth: he was adored
by the populace, who loudly exclaimed again&s;t their go|vernors,
and clamoured for a war, without cea&s;ing. This
national &s;pirit, joined to the remon&s;trances and requi&s;itions
made by the courts of Vienna and London, obliged the
States to i&s;&s;ue orders for an augmentation of their forces:
<PB N="64" REF="68">
but the&s;e were executed &s;o &s;lowly, that neither France nor
Pru&s;&s;ia had much cau&s;e to take umbrage at their prepara|tions.
In Italy the King of Sardinia declared for the hou&s;e
of Au&s;tria: the republick of Genoa was deeply engaged in
the French intere&s;t: the Pope, the Venetians, and the
dukedom of Tu&s;cany were neutral: the King of Naples
re&s;olved to &s;upport the claim of his family to the Au&s;trian
dominions in Italy, and began to make preparations accor|dingly.
His mother, the Queen of Spain, had formed a
plan for erecting the&s;e dominions into a monarchy for her
&s;econd &s;on Don Philip; and a body of fifteen thou&s;and
men being embarked at Barcelona, were tran&s;ported to
Orbitello, under the convoy of the united &s;quadrons of
France and Spain. While Admiral Haddock, with twelve
&s;hips of the line, lay at anchor in the bay of Gibraltar, the
Spani&s;h fleet pa&s;&s;ed the &s;traits in the night, and was joined
by the French &s;quadron from Toulon. The Briti&s;h ad|miral
&s;ailing from Gibraltar, fell in with them in a few
days, and found both &s;quadrons drawn up in line of battle.
As he bore down upon the Spani&s;h fleet, the French admi|ral
&s;ent a flag of truce, to inform him, that as the French
and Spaniards were engaged in a joint-expedition, he
&s;hould be obliged to act in concert with his ma&s;ter's allies.
This interpo&s;ition prevented an engagement. The com|bined
fleets amounting to double the number of the
Engli&s;h &s;quadron, Admiral Haddock was obliged to de&s;i&s;t;
and proceeded to Port-Mahon, leaving the enemy to pro|&s;ecute
their voyage without mole&s;tation. The people of
England were incen&s;ed at this tran&s;action, and did not
&s;cruple to affirm, that the hands of the Briti&s;h admiral
were tied up by the neutrality of Hanover.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>In the month of July two &s;hips of Haddock's &s;quadron falling it with three French &s;hips of war, Captain Barnet, the Engli&s;h commodore, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be Spani&s;h regi&s;ter &s;hips, fired a &s;hot, in order to bring them to; and they refu&s;ing to comply with this &s;ignal, a &s;harp en|gagement en&s;ued: after they had fought &s;everal hours, the French com|mander cea&s;ed firing, and thought proper to come to an explanation when he and Barnet parted with mutual apologies.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this year a dangerous con&s;piracy was di&s;covered at New-York in North America. One Hew&s;on, a low publican, had engaged &s;e|veral negroes in a de&s;ign to de&s;troy the town, and ma&s;&s;acre the people. Fire was &s;et to &s;everal parts of the city; nine or ten negroes were appre|hended, convicted, and burned alive. Hew&s;on, with his wi&s;e, and a &s;ervant-maid, privy to the plot, were found guilty, and hanged, though they died prote&s;ting their innocence.</P></NOTE>.</P>

&sect; XV. The court of Madrid &s;eemed to have &s;haken off
that indolence and phlegm which had formerly di&s;graced
the councils of Spain. They no &s;ooner learned the de&s;ti|nation
of Commodore An&s;on, who had &s;ailed from Spit|head
in the cour&s;e of the preceding year, than they &s;ent
Don Pizzaro, with a more powerful &s;quadron, upon the
&s;ame voyage, to defeat his de&s;ign. He accordingly &s;teered
the &s;ame cour&s;e, and actually fell in with one or two &s;hips
of the Briti&s;h armament, near the Straits of Magellan:
but he could not weather a long and furious tempe&s;t
through which Mr. An&s;on proceeded into the South-Sea.
One of the Spani&s;h &s;hips peri&s;hed at &s;ea: another was
wrecked on the coa&s;t of Brazil; and Pizzaro bore away
for the Rio de la Plata, where he arrived with the three
remaining &s;hips, in a &s;hattered condition, after having lo&s;t
twelve hundred men by &s;ickne&s;s and famine. The Spa|niards
exerted the &s;ame vigilance and activity in Europe.
Their privateers were &s;o indu&s;trious and &s;ucce&s;sful, that
in the beginning of this year they had taken, &s;ince the
commencement of the war, four hundred and &s;even &s;hips
belonging to the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, valued at near
four millions of pia&s;tres. The traders had, therefore, too
much cau&s;e to complain, con&s;idering the formidable fleets
which were maintained for the protection of commerce.
In the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer, Sir John Norris had twice
&s;ailed towards the coa&s;t of Spain, at the head of a power|ful
&s;quadron, without taking any effectual &s;tep for annoy|ing
the enemy, as if the &s;ole intention of the mini&s;try had
been to expo&s;e the nation to the ridicule and contempt of
its enemies. The inactivity of the Briti&s;h arms appears
the more inexcu&s;able, when we con&s;ider the great arma|ments
which had been prepared. The land-forces of
<PB N="66" REF="70">
Great-Britain, exclu&s;ive of the Dani&s;h and He&s;&s;ian auxi|liaries,
amounted to &s;ixty thou&s;and men; and the fleet
con&s;i&s;ted of above one hundred &s;hips of war, manned by
fifty-four thou&s;and &s;ailors.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. The general di&s;content of the people had a ma|nife&s;t
influence upon the election of members for the new
parliament, which produced one of the mo&s;t violent con|te&s;ts
between the two parties, which had happened &s;ince
the Revolution. All the adherents of the Prince of Wale
concurred with the country party, in oppo&s;ition to the
mini&s;ter; and the Duke of Argyle exerted him&s;elf &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sfully
among the &s;hires and boroughs of Scotland, that
the parti&s;ans of the mini&s;try could not &s;ecure &s;ix member
out of the whole number returned from North-Britain&punc;
They were, however, much more fortunate in the election
of the &s;ixteen peers, who were cho&s;en literally according to
the li&s;t tran&s;mitted from court. In&s;tructions were deliver+ed
by the con&s;tituents to a great number of members re+turned
for cities and counties, exhorting and requiring
them to oppo&s;e a &s;tanding army in time of peace; to vote
for the mitigation of exci&s;e laws; for the repeal of &s;eptenni+al
parliaments; and for the limitation of placemen in the
Hou&s;e of Commons. They, likewi&s;e, in&s;i&s;ted upon thei$
examining into the particulars of the publick expen&s;e
and endeavouring to redre&s;s the grievances of the nation
Ob&s;tinate &s;truggles were maintained in all parts of the uni+ted
kingdom with uncommon ardour and per&s;everance; and
&s;uch a national &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition prevailed, that, notwith+&s;tanding
the whole weight of mini&s;terial influence, the con+trary
intere&s;t &s;eemed to preponderate in the new parliament.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The King returned to England in the mont$
of October; and on the fir&s;t day of December the &s;e&s;&s;io$
was opened. Mr. On&s;low being re-cho&s;en &s;peaker was
approved of by his Maje&s;ty, who &s;poke in the u&s;ual &s;tile
to both Hou&s;es. He ob&s;erved that the former parliament
had formed the &s;tronge&s;t re&s;olutions in favour of the
Queen of Hungary, for the maintenance of the prag|matick
&s;anction; for the pre&s;ervation of the balance $word$
<PB N="67" REF="71">
power, and the peace and liberties of Europe; and that
if the other powers which were under the like engage|ments
with him had an&s;wered the ju&s;t expectations
&s;o &s;olemnly given, the &s;upport of the common cau&s;e
would have been attended with le&s;s difficulty. He &s;aid,
he had endeavoured, by the mo&s;t proper and early appli|cations,
to induce other powers that were united with him
by the ties of common intere&s;t to concert &s;uch mea&s;ures
as &s;o important and critical a conjuncture required: that
where an accommodation &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary, he had la|boured
to reconcile princes who&s;e union would have been
the mo&s;t effectual means to prevent the mi&s;chiefs which
had happened, and the be&s;t &s;ecurity for the intere&s;t and
&s;afety of the whole. He owned his endeavours had not
hitherto produced the de&s;ired effect; though he was not
without hope, that a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of approaching danger
would give a more favourable turn to the councils of
other nations. He repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of putting the
kingdom in &s;uch a po&s;ture of defence as would enable
him to improve all opportunities of maintaining the liber|ties
of Europe, and defeat any attempts that &s;hould be
made again&s;t him and his dominions; and he recommend|ed
unanimity, vigour, and di&s;patch. The Hou&s;e of Com|mons
having appointed their &s;everal committees, the
Speaker reported the King's &s;peech; and Mr. Herbert
moved for an addre&s;s of thanks, including an approbation
of the means by which the war had been pro&s;ecuted.
The motion being &s;econded by Mr. Trevor, Lord Noel
Somer&s;et &s;tood up, and moved that the Hou&s;e would
in their addre&s;s de&s;ire his Maje&s;ty not to engage the&s;e
kingdoms in a war for the pre&s;ervation of his foreign
dominions. He was &s;upported by that incorruptible pa|triot,
Mr. Shippen, who declared he was neither a&s;hamed
nor afraid to affirm, that thirty years had made no change
in any of his political opinions. He &s;aid he was grown
old in the Hou&s;e of Commons; that time had verified the
predictions he had formerly uttered; and that he had &s;een
his conjectures ripened into knowledge. &startq;If my country
<PB N="68" REF="72">
(added he) has been &s;o unfortunate as once more to com|mit
her intere&s;t to men who propo&s;e to them&s;elves no
advantage from their tru&s;t but that of &s;elling it, I may,
perhaps, fall once more under cen&s;ure for declaring
my opinion, and be once more treated as a criminal,
for a&s;&s;erting what they who puni&s;h me cannot deny;
for maintaining that Hanoverian maxims are incon&s;i&s;t|ent
with the happine&s;s of this nation; and for pre&s;erv|ing
the caution &s;o &s;trongly inculcated by tho&s;e patriots
who framed the act of &s;ettlement, and conferred upon
the pre&s;ent royal family their title to the throne.&endq; He
particulari&s;ed the in&s;tances in which the mini&s;try had
acted in diametrical oppo&s;ition to that nece&s;&s;ary con&s;ti|tution;
and he in&s;i&s;ted on the nece&s;&s;ity of taking &s;ome
&s;tep to remove the apprehen&s;ions of the people, who be|gan
to think them&s;elves in danger of being &s;acrificed to
the &s;ecurity of foreign dominions. Mr. Gibbon, who
&s;poke on the &s;ame &s;ide of the que&s;tion, expatiated
upon the ab&s;urdity of returning thanks for the pro&s;ecu|tion
of a war which had been egregiou&s;ly mi&s;managed.
&startq;What! (&s;aid he) are our thanks to be &s;olemnly re|turned
for defeats, di&s;grace, and lo&s;&s;es, the ruin of
our merchants, the impri&s;onment of our &s;ailors, idle
&s;hows of armaments, and u&s;ele&s;s expen&s;es?&endq; Sir Ro|bert
Walpole having made a &s;hort &s;peech in defence of the
fir&s;t motion for an addre&s;s, was an&s;wered by Mr. Pul|teney,
who &s;eemed to be animated with a double propor|tion
of patriot indignation. He a&s;&s;erted, that from a
review of that mini&s;ter's conduct &s;ince the beginning of
the di&s;pute with Spain, it would appear that he had been
guilty not only of &s;ingle errors, but of deliberate trea|chery:
that he had always co-operated with the enemies
of his country, and &s;acrificed to his private intere&s;t the
happine&s;s and honour of the Briti&s;h nation. He then
entered into a detail of that conduct again&s;t which he
had &s;o often declaimed; and being tran&s;ported by an
over-heated imagination, accu&s;ed him of per&s;onal attach|ment
and affection to the enemies of the kingdom. A
<PB N="69" REF="73">
charge that was doubtle&s;s the re&s;ult of exaggerated ani|mo&s;ity,
and &s;erved only to invalidate the other articles
of imputation that were much better founded. His ob|jections
were over-ruled; and the addre&s;s, as at fir&s;t pro|po&s;ed,
was pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. This &s;mall advantage, however, the mini&s;ter
did not con&s;ider as a proof of his having a&s;certained an
undoubted majority in the Hou&s;e of Commons. There
was a great number of di&s;puted elections; and the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion
of the&s;e was the point on which the people had
turned their eyes, as the criterion of the mini&s;ter's power
and credit. In the fir&s;t which was heard at the bar of
the Hou&s;e, he carried his point by a majority of &s;ix only;
and this he looked upon as a defeat rather than a victory.
His enemies exulted in their &s;trength: as they knew they
&s;hould be joined, in matters of importance, by &s;everal
members who voted again&s;t them on this occa&s;ion. The
incon&s;iderable majority that appeared on the &s;ide of the
admini&s;tration plainly proved that the influence of the
mini&s;ter was greatly dimini&s;hed, and &s;eemed to progno&s;ti|cate
his further decline. This con&s;ideration induced
&s;ome individuals to declare again&s;t him as a &s;etting &s;un,
from who&s;e beams they could expect no further warmth.
His adherents began to tremble; and he him&s;elf had oc|ca&s;ion
for all his art and equanimity. The court intere&s;t
was not &s;ufficient to &s;upport the election of their own
members for We&s;tmin&s;ter. The high-bailiff had been
guilty of &s;ome illegal practices at the poll; and three
ju&s;tices of the peace had, on pretence of preventing riots,
&s;ent for a military force to over-awe the election. A peti|tion
pre&s;ented by the electors of We&s;tmin&s;ter was taken
into con&s;ideration by the Hou&s;e; and the election was de|clared
void by a majority of four voices. The high-bailiff
was taken into cu&s;tody: the officer who ordered the &s;ol|diers
to march, and the three ju&s;tices who &s;igned the let|ter,
in con&s;equence of which he acted, were reprimanded
on their knees at the bar of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="74">
&sect; XIX. The country-party maintained the advan|tage
they had gained in deciding upon &s;everal other
controverted elections; and Sir Robert Walpole tot|tered
on the brink of ruin. He knew that the majo|rity
of a &s;ingle vote would at any time commit him
pri&s;oner to the Tower, &s;hould ever the motion be made;
and he &s;aw that his &s;afety could be effected by no other
expedient but that of dividing the oppo&s;ition. Towards
the accompli&s;hment of this purpo&s;e he employed all his
credit and dexterity. His emi&s;&s;aries did not fail to tam|per
with tho&s;e members of the oppo&s;ite party who were
the mo&s;t likely to be converted by their arguments.
A me&s;&s;age was &s;ent by the Bi&s;hop of Oxford to the
Prince of Wales, importing, That if his royal high|ne&s;s
would write a letter of conde&s;cen&s;ion to the
King, he and all his coun&s;ellors &s;hould be taken into fa|vour;
that fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be added to his
revenue; four times that &s;um be di&s;bur&s;ed immediately
for the payment of his debts; and &s;uitable provi&s;ion be
made in due time for all his followers. The Prince de|clined
this propo&s;al. He declared that he would accept
no &s;uch conditions while Sir Robert Walpole continued
to direct the public affairs: that he looked upon him as
a bar between his Maje&s;ty and the affections of his
people; as the author of the national grievances both
at home and abroad; and as the &s;ole cau&s;e of that
contempt which Great-Britain had incurred in all the
courts of Europe. His royal highne&s;s was now chief
of this formidable party, revered by the whole na|tion
&mdash;a party which had gained the a&s;cendancy in
the Hou&s;e of Commons; which profe&s;&s;ed to act upon
the principles of publick virtue; which demanded the
fall of an odious mini&s;ter, as a &s;acrifice due to an injured
people; and declared that no temptation could &s;hake
their virtue; that no art could di&s;&s;olve the cement by
which they were united. Sir Robert Walpole, though
repul&s;ed in his attempt upon the Prince of Wales, was
more &s;ucce&s;sful in his other endeavours. He re&s;olved to
<PB N="71" REF="75">
try his &s;trength once more in the Hou&s;e of Commons,
in another di&s;puted election; and had the mortification
to &s;ee the majority augmented to &s;ixteen voices. He de|clared
he would never more &s;it in that Hou&s;e; and
next day, which was the third of February, the King
adjourned both Hou&s;es of parliament to the eighteenth
day of the &s;ame month. In this interim Sir Robert Wal|pole
was created Earl of Orford, and re&s;igned all his em|ployments.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. At no time of his life did he acquit him&s;elf with
&s;uch prudential policy as he now di&s;played. He found
means to &s;eparate the parts that compo&s;ed the oppo&s;ition,
and to transfer the popular odium from him&s;elf to tho&s;e
who had profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves his keene&s;t adver&s;aries. The
country-party con&s;i&s;ted of the Tories, re-enforced by
di&s;contented Whigs, who had either been di&s;appointed in
their own ambitious views, or felt for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of
their country, occa&s;ioned by a weak and worthle&s;s admi|ni&s;tration.
The old patriots, and the Whigs whom they
had joined, acted upon very different, and, indeed, upon
oppo&s;ite principles of government; and, therefore, they
were united only by the ties of convenience. A coalition
was projected between the di&s;contented Whigs and tho&s;e
of the &s;ame denomination who acted in the mini&s;try.
Some were gratified with titles and offices; and all were
a&s;&s;ured, that in the management of affairs a new &s;y&s;tem
would be adopted, according to the plan they them&s;elves
&s;hould propo&s;e. The court required nothing of them,
but that the Earl of Orford &s;hould e&s;cape with impunity.
His place of Chancellor of the Exchequer was be&s;towed
upon Mr. Sandys, who was likewi&s;e appointed a lord of
the Trea&s;ury; and the Earl of Wilmington &s;ucceeded him
as fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of that board. Lord Harrington
being dignified with the title of Earl, was declared pre&s;i|dent
of the council; and in his room Lord Carteret be|came
&s;ecretary of &s;tate. The Duke of Argyle was made
ma&s;ter-general of the Ordnance, colonel of his Maje&s;ty's
royal regiment of hor&s;e-guards, field-mar&s;hal and comman|der
<PB N="72" REF="76">
in chief of all the forces in South-Britain; but, find|ing
him&s;elf di&s;appointed in his expectations of the coalition,
h$, in le&s;s than a month, renounced all the&s;e employments.
The Marquis of Tweedale was appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate
for Scotland, a po&s;t which had been long &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: Mr.
Pulteney was &s;worn of the privy council, and afterwards
created Earl of Bath. The Earl of Winchel&s;ea and Not|tingham
was preferred to the head of the Admiralty, in the
room of Sir Charles Wager; and, after the re&s;ignation of
the Duke of Argyle, the Earl of Stair was appointed field
mar&s;hal of all his Maje&s;ty's forces, as well as amba&s;&s;ador-extraordinary
to the States-General. On the &s;eventeenth
day of February the Prince of Wales, attended by a numer|ous
retinue of his adherents, waited on his Maje&s;ty, who
received him graciou&s;ly, and ordered his guards to be
re&s;tored. Lord Carteret and Mr. Sandys were the fir&s;t
who embraced the offers of the Court, without the con&s;ent
or privity of any other leaders in the oppo&s;ition, except that
of Mr. Pulteney; but they declared to their friends, they
would &s;till proceed upon patriot principles: that they would
concur in promoting an enquiry into pa&s;t mea&s;ures; and
in enacting nece&s;&s;ary laws to &s;ecure the con&s;titution from
the practices of corruption. The&s;e profe&s;&s;ions were believ|ed,
not only by their old coadjutors in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
but al&s;o by the nation in general. The reconcilia|tion
between the King and the Prince of Wales, together
with the change in the mini&s;try, were celebrated with pub|lick
rejoicings all over the kingdom; and immediately
after the adjournment nothing but concord appeared in
the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. But this harmony was of &s;hort duration. It
&s;oon appeared, that tho&s;e who had declaimed the loude&s;t
for the liberties of their country had been actuated &s;olely
by the mo&s;t &s;ordid, and even the mo&s;t ridiculous motives
of &s;elf intere&s;t. Jealou&s;y and mutual di&s;tru&s;t en&s;ued
between them and their former confederates. The nation
complained, that, in&s;tead of a total change of men and
mea&s;ures, they &s;aw the old mini&s;try &s;trengthened by this
<PB N="73" REF="77">
coalition; and the &s;ame intere&s;t in parliament predominat|ing
with redoubled influence. They branded the new
converts as apo&s;tates and betrayers of their country; and
in the tran&s;ports of their indignation, they entirely over|looked
the old object of their re&s;entment. That a noble|man
of pliant principles, narrow fortune, and un|bounded
ambition, &s;hould for&s;ake his party for the blan|di&s;hment
of affluence, power, and authority, will not
appear &s;trange to any per&s;on acquainted with the human
heart; but the &s;en&s;ible part of mankind will always reflect
with amazement upon the conduct of a man, who &s;eeing
him&s;elf idolized by his fellow-citizens, as the fir&s;t and
firme&s;t patriot of the kingdom, as one of the mo&s;t &s;hining
ornaments of his country, could give up all his popularity,
and incur the contempt or dete&s;tation of mankind, for the
wretched con&s;ideration of an empty title, without office,
influence, or the lea&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial appendage. One cannot,
without an emotion of grief, contemplate &s;uch an in&s;tance
of infatuation&mdash;One cannot but lament, that &s;uch glory
&s;hould have been &s;o weakly forfeited: that &s;uch talents
&s;hould have been lo&s;t to the cau&s;e of liberty and virtue.
Doubtle&s;s, he flattered him&s;elf with the hope of one day
directing the councils of his &s;overeign; but this was never
accompli&s;hed, and he remained a &s;olitary monument of
bla&s;ted ambition. Before the change in the mini&s;try, Mr.
Pulteney moved that the &s;everal papers relating to the con|duct
of the war which had been laid before the Hou&s;e
&s;hould be referred to a &s;elect committee, who &s;hould exa|mine
&s;trictly into the particulars, and make a report to the
Hou&s;e of their remarks and objections. The motion in|troduced
a debate; but, upon a divi&s;ion, was rejected by
a majority of three voices. Petitions having been pre&s;ent|ed
by the merchants of London, Bri&s;tol, Liverpool, Gla&s;|gow,
and almo&s;t all the trading towns in the kingdom, com|plaining
of the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained by the bad conduct
of the war, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee, to
deliberate on the&s;e remon&s;trances. The articles of the
London petition were explained by Mr. Glover, an eminent
<PB N="74" REF="78">
merchant of that city. Six days were &s;pent in peru&s;ing
papers and examining witne&s;&s;es: then the &s;ame gentleman
&s;ummed up the evidence, and in a pathetick &s;peech endea|voured
to demon&s;trate, that the commerce of Great-Britain
had been expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults and rapine of the Spa|niards,
not by inattention or accident, but by one uniform
and continued de&s;ign. This inquiry being re&s;umed after
the adjournment, copies of in&s;tructions to admirals and
captains of crui&s;ing &s;hips were laid before the Hou&s;e: the
Commons pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal re&s;olutions, upon which a bill wa$
prepared for the better protecting and &s;ecuring the trad$
and navigation of the kingdom. It made its way through
the Lower Hou&s;e; but was thrown out by the Lords&punc;
The pen&s;ion-bill was revived and &s;ent up to the Peers
where it was again rejected, Lord Carteret voting again&s;t
that very mea&s;ure which he had &s;o lately endeavoured to
promote. On the ninth day of March Lord Limeric$$
made a motion for appointing a committee to enquire in
to the conduct of affairs for the la&s;t twenty years: he wa$
&s;econded by Sir John St. Aubyn, and &s;upported by Mr&punc;
Velters Cornwall, Mr. Phillips, Mr. W. Pitt, and Lord
Percival, the new member for We&s;tmin&s;ter, who had al$
ready &s;ignalized him&s;elf by his eloquence and capacity&punc;
The motion was oppo&s;ed by Sir Charles Wager, Mr&punc;
Pelham, and Mr. Henry Fox, &s;urveyor-general to hi$
Maje&s;ty's works, and brother to Lord Ilche&s;ter. Though
the oppo&s;ition was faint and frivolous, the propo&s;al wa$
rejected by a majority of two voices. Lord Limerick, no
yet di&s;couraged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1742.</NOTE> made a motion, on the twenty-third day
of March, for an enquiry into the conduct of Robert Ear$
of Orford, for the la&s;t ten years of his admini&s;tration
and, after a &s;harp debate, it was carried in the affirmative&punc;
The Hou&s;e re&s;olved to choo&s;e a &s;ecret committee by ballot
and in the mean time pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the King
a&s;&s;uring him of their fidelity, zeal, and affection.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. Sir Robert God&s;chall having moved for lea$$
to bring in a bill to repeal the act for &s;eptennial parlia|ments,
he was &s;econded by Sir John Barnard; but warmly
<PB N="75" REF="79">
oppo&s;ed by Mr. Pulteney and Mr. Sandys; and the que&s;tion
pa&s;&s;ed in the negative. The committee of &s;ecre&s;y being
cho&s;en, began to examine evidence, and Mr. Paxton, &s;ol|licitor
to the Trea&s;ury, refu&s;ing to an&s;wer &s;uch que&s;tions
as were put to him, Lord Limerick, chairman of the com|mittee,
complained to the Hou&s;e of his ob&s;tinacy. He
was fir&s;t taken into cu&s;tody; and &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in his re|fu&s;al,
committed to Newgate. Then his lord&s;hip moved,
that leave &s;hould be given to bring in a bill for indemnify|ing
evidence again&s;t the Earl of Orford; and it was
actually prepared by a deci&s;ion of the majority. In the
Hou&s;e of Lords it was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Lord Carteret,
and as &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported by the Duke of Argyle; but
fell upon a divi&s;ion, by the weight of &s;uperior numbers.
Tho&s;e members in the Hou&s;e of Commons who heartily
wi&s;hed that the enquiry might be pro&s;ecuted were ex|tremely
incen&s;ed at the fate of this bill. A committee
was appointed to &s;earch the journals of the Lords for pre|cedents:
their report being read, Lord Strange, &s;on of the
Earl of Derby, moved for a re&s;olution, &startq;That the Lords
refu&s;ing to concur with the Commons of Great-Britain,
in an indemnification nece&s;&s;ary to the effectual carrying
on the enquiry now depending in parliament, is an ob|&s;truction
to ju&s;tice, and may prove fatal to the liberties of
this nation.&endq;&mdash;This motion, which was &s;econded by Lord
Quarendon, &s;on of the Earl of Lichfield, gave ri&s;e to a
warm debate; and Mr. Sandys declaimed again&s;t it, as a
&s;tep that would bring on an immediate di&s;&s;olution of the
pre&s;ent form of government. It is really amazing to &s;ee
with what effrontery &s;ome men can &s;hift their maxims,
and openly contradict the whole tenor of their former
conduct. Mr. Sandys did not pa&s;s uncen&s;ured: he &s;u|&s;tained
&s;ome &s;evere &s;arca&s;ms on his apo&s;tacy, from Sir John
Hynde Cotton, who refuted all his objections: neverthe|le&s;s,
the motion pa&s;&s;ed in the negative. Notwith&s;tanding
this great ob&s;truction, purpo&s;ely thrown in the way of the
enquiry, the &s;ecret committee di&s;covered many flagrant
in&s;tances of fraud and corruption in which the Earl of
<PB N="76" REF="80">
Orford had been concerned. It appeared that he had
granted fraudulent contracts for paying the troops in the
We&s;t-Indies: that he had employed iniquitous arts to in|fluence
elections: that for &s;ecret-&s;ervice, during the la&s;t
ten years, he had touched one million four hundred fifty-three
thou&s;and four hundred pounds of the publick money:
that above fifty thou&s;and pounds of this &s;um had been paid
to authors and printers of news-papers and political
tracts written in defence of the mini&s;try: that on the very
day which preceded his re&s;ignation he had &s;igned orders on
the civil-li&s;t revenues for above thirty thou&s;and pounds:
but as the ca&s;h remaining in the Exchequer did not much
exceed fourteen thou&s;and pounds, he had rai&s;ed the remain|ing
part of the thirty thou&s;and, by pawning the orders to a
banker. The committee proceeded to make further progre&s;s
in their &s;crutiny, and had almo&s;t prepared a third report,
when they were interrupted by the prorogation of parlia|ment.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. The mini&s;try, finding it was nece&s;&s;ary to take
&s;ome &s;tep for conciliating the affection of the people, gave
way to a bill for excluding certain officers from &s;eats in
the Hou&s;e of Commons. They pa&s;&s;ed another for en|couraging
the linen manufacture; a third for regulating
the trade of the plantations; and a fourth to prevent the
marriage of lunaticks. They voted forty thou&s;and &s;ea-men,
and &s;ixty-two thou&s;and five hundred landmen for the
&s;ervice of the current year. They provided for the &s;ub|&s;idies
to Denmark and He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, and voted five hun|dred
thou&s;and pounds to the Queen of Hungary. The
expen&s;e of the year amounted to near &s;ix millions, rai&s;ed by
the land tax at four &s;hillings in the pound, by a malt-tax,
by one million from the &s;inking fund, by annuities granted
upon it for eight hundred thou&s;and pounds, and a loan of
one million &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds, from the Bank.
In the month of July, John Lord Gower was appointed
keeper of his Maje&s;ty's privy-&s;eal: Allen Lord Bathur&s;t was
made captain of the band of pen&s;ioners; and on the fifteenth
day of the month, Mr. Pulteney took his &s;eat in the Hou&s;e
of Peers, as Earl of Bath. The King clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion in
<PB N="77" REF="81">
the u&s;ual way, after having given them to under&s;tand, that
a treaty of peace was concluded between the Queen of
Hungary and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, under his mediation;
and that the late &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Au&s;trian arms were in a
great mea&s;ure owing to the generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance afforded by
the Briti&s;h nation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. By this time great changes had happened in
the affairs of the continent. The elector of Bavaria was
cho&s;en Emperor of Germany at Franckfort on the Maine,
and crowned by the name of Charles VII. on the twelfth
day of February. Thither the imperial diet was removed
from Rati&s;bon: they confirmed his election, and indulged
him with a &s;ub&s;idy of fifty Roman months, amounting to
about two hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. In the
mean time, the Au&s;trian general, Khevenhuller, ravaged
his electorate, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Munich, the
capital of Bavaria: he likewi&s;e laid part of the Palatinate
under contribution, in re&s;entment for that Elector's having
&s;ent a body of his troops to re-enforce the Imperial army.
In March, Count Saxe, with a detachment of French
and Bavarians, reduced Egra; and the Au&s;trians were
obliged to evacuate Bavaria, though they afterwards re|turned.
Khevenhuller took po&s;t in the neighbourhood of
Pa&s;&s;au, and detached General Bernclau to Dinglefing on
the I&s;er, to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy, who were
now become extremely formidable. In May, a detach|ment
of French and Bavarians advanced to the ca&s;tle of
Hilker&s;bergh on the Danube, with a view to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of a bridge over the river: the Au&s;trian garri&s;on immedi|diately
marched out to give them battle, and a &s;evere
action en&s;ued, in which the Imperiali&s;ts were defeated.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. In the beginning of the year, the Queen of
Hungary had a&s;&s;embled two con&s;iderable armies in Mora|via
and Bohemia. Prince Charles of Lorraine, at the head
of fifty thou&s;and men, advanced again&s;t the Saxons and
Pru&s;&s;ians, who thought proper to retire with precipiation
from Moravia, which they had invaded. Then the Prince
$ook the route to Bohemia; and Mar&s;hal Broglio, who com|manded
<PB N="78" REF="82">
the French forces in that country, mu&s;t have
fallen a &s;acrifice, had not the King of Pru&s;&s;ia received a
&s;trong re-enforcement, and entered that kingdom before
his allies could be attacked. The two armies advanced
towards each other; and, on the &s;eventeenth of May,
joined battle at Cza&s;law, where the Au&s;trians at fir&s;t gain|ed
a manife&s;t advantage, and penetrated as far as the Pru&s;|&s;ian
baggage: then the irregulars began to plunder &s;o eagerly,
that they neglected every other con&s;ideration. The Pru&s;|&s;ian
infantry took this opportunity to rally: the battle was
renewed, and, after a very ob&s;tinate conte&s;t, the victory
was &s;natched out of the hands of the Au&s;trians, who were
obliged to retire, with the lo&s;s of five thou&s;and men killed,
and twelve hundred taken by the enemy. The Pru&s;&s;ians
paid dear for the honour of remaining on the field of battle;
and from the circum&s;tances of this action the King is
&s;aid to have conceived a di&s;gu&s;t to the war. When the
Au&s;trians made &s;uch progre&s;s in the beginning of the en|gagement,
he rode off with great expedition, untilhe was
recalled by a me&s;&s;age from his general, the Count de Schwe|rin,
a&s;&s;uring his Maje&s;ty that there was no danger of a
defeat. Immediately after this battle, he di&s;covered an in|clination
to accommodate all differences with the Queen
of Hungary. The Earl of Hyndford, amba&s;&s;ador from
the court of Great-Britain, who accompanied him in this
campaign, and was ve&s;ted with full powers by her Hunga|rian
Maje&s;ty, did not fail to cultivate this favourable di&s;|po&s;ition;
and on the fir&s;t day of June, a treaty of peace be|tween
the two powers was concluded at Bre&s;law. The
Queen ceded to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty the Upper and Lower
Sile&s;ia, with the county of Glatz in Bohemia; and he
charged him&s;elf with the payment of the &s;um lent by the
merchants of London to the late Emperor, on the Sile&s;ian
revenues. He likewi&s;e engaged to ob&s;erve a &s;trict neutra|lity
during the war, and to withdraw his forces from Bo|hemia
in fifteen days after the ratification of the treaty, in
which were comprehended the King of Great-Britain
Elector of Hanover, the Czarina, the King of Denmark,
<PB N="79" REF="83">
the States-General, the hou&s;e of Wolfenbuttle, and the
King of Poland Elector of Saxony, on certain conditions,
which were accepted.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia recalled his troops; while
Mare&s;chal Broglio, who commanded the French auxilia|ries
in that kingdom, and the Count de Bellei&s;le, abandon|ed
their magazines and baggage, and retired with precipi|tation
under the cannon of Prague. There they entrenched
them&s;elves in an advantageous &s;ituation; and Prince Charles
being joined by the other body of Au&s;trians, under Prince
Lobkowitz, encamped in &s;ight of them, on the hills of
Giri&s;nitz. The Grand Duke of Tu&s;cany arrived in the
Au&s;trian army, of which he took the command; and the
French generals offered to &s;urrender Prague, Egra, and all
the other places they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Bohemia, provided they
might be allowed to march off with their arms, artillery,
and baggage. The propo&s;al was rejected, and Prague in|ve&s;ted
on all &s;ides about the end of July. Though the
operations of the &s;iege were carried on in an aukward and
&s;lovenly manner, the place was &s;o effectually blocked up,
that famine mu&s;t have compelled the French to &s;urrender
at di&s;cretion, had not very extraordinary efforts been made
for their relief. The Emperor had made advances to the
Queen of Hungary. He promi&s;ed that the French forces
&s;hould quit Bohemia, and evacuate the empire; and he
offered to renounce all preten&s;ions to the kingdom of Bohe|mia,
on condition that the Au&s;tians would re&s;tore Bavaria:
but the&s;e conditions were declined by the court of Vienna.
The King of France was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of the condi|tion
to which the Generals Broglio and Bellei&s;le were
reduced, than he &s;ent orders to Mar&s;hal Maillebois, who
commanded his army on the Rhine, to march to their re|lief.
His troops were immediately put in motion; and
when they reached Amberg in the Upper Palatinate were
joined to the French and Imperiali&s;ts from Bavaria. Prince
Charles of Lorraine having received intelligence of their
junction and de&s;ign, left eighteen thou&s;and men to main|tain
the blockade of Prague, under the command of Gene|ral
<PB N="80" REF="84">
Fe&s;titiz, while he him&s;elf, with the re&s;t of his army,
advanced to Haydon on the frontiers of Bohemia. There
he was joined by Count Khevenhuller, who from Bavaria
had followed the enemy, now commanded by Count Sec|kendorff,
and the Count de Saxe. Seckendorff, however,
was &s;ent back to Bavaria, while Mar&s;hal Maillebois enter|ed
Bohemia on the twenty-fifth day of September. But
he marched with &s;uch precaution, that Prince Charles
could not bring him to an engagement. Mean while
Fe&s;tititz, for want of &s;ufficient force, was obliged to aban|don
the blockade of Prague, and the French generals being
now at liberty, took po&s;t at Leutmaritz. Maillebois ad|vanced
as far as Kadan: but &s;eeing the Au&s;trians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of all the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains, he marched back to the
Palatinate, and was mi&s;erably harra&s;&s;ed in his retreat by
Prince Charles, who had left a &s;trong body with Prince
Lobkowitz, to watch the motions of Bellei&s;le and Broglio&punc;</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. The&s;e generals &s;eeing them&s;elves &s;urrounded
on all hands, returned to Prague, from whence Broglio
made his e&s;cape in the habit of a courier, and was &s;ent to
command the army of Maillebois, who was by this time
di&s;graced. Prince Lobkowitz, who now directed the
blockade of Prague, had &s;o effectually cut off all commu$nication
between the place and the adjacent country, tha$
in a little time the French troops were reduced to great
extremity, both from the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on, and th$
want of provi&s;ion. They were already reduced to the nece$$&s;ity
of eating hor&s;e-fle&s;h, and unclean animals; and the$
had no other pro&s;pect but that of peri&s;hing by famine $word$
war, when their commander formed the &s;cheme of a $word$
treat, which was actually put in execution. Having take
&s;ome artful precautions to deceive the enemy, he, in the
middle of December, departed from Prague at midnigh$
with about fourteen thou&s;and men, thirty pieces of arti|lery,
and &s;ome of the principal citizens as ho&s;tages for the
&s;afety of nine hundred &s;oldiers whom he had left in garri&s;on
Notwith&s;tanding the difficulties he mu&s;t have encounter$
at that &s;ea&s;on of the year, in a broken and unfrequented roa$
<PB N="81" REF="85">
which he purpo&s;ely cho&s;e, he marched with &s;uch expedi|tion,
that he had gained the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains, be|fore
he was overtaken by the hor&s;e and hu&s;&s;ars of Prince
Lobkowitz. The fatigue and hard&s;hips which the mi&s;era|ble
&s;oldiers underwent are inexpre&s;&s;ible. A great number
peri&s;hed in the &s;now, and many hundreds, fainting with
wearine&s;s, cold, and hunger, were left to the mercy of the
Au&s;trian irregulars, con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t barbarous people
on the face of the earth. The Count de Bellei&s;le, though
tortured with the hip-gout, behaved with &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;o|lution
and activity. He cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be carried in a
litter to every place where he thought his pre&s;ence was
nece&s;&s;ary, and made &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, that the pur&s;uers
never could make an impre&s;&s;ion upon the body of his troops:
but all his artillery, baggage, and even his own equipage,
fell into the hands of the enemy. On the twenty-ninth
day of December, he arrived at Egra, from whence he
proceeded to Al&s;ace without further mole&s;tation: but,
when he returned to Ver&s;ailles, he met with a very cold re|ception,
notwith&s;tanding the gallant exploit which he had
performed. After his e&s;cape, Prince Lobkowitz returned
to Prague, and the &s;mall garri&s;on which Bellei&s;le had left
in that place &s;urrendered upon honourable terms; &s;o that
this capital reverted to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. The King of Great-Britain re&s;olving to make
a powerful diver&s;ion in the Netherlands, had, in the month
of April, ordered &s;ixteen thou&s;and effective men to be em|barked
for that country; but, as this &s;tep was taken with|out
any previous concert with the States-General, the
Earl of Stair, de&s;tined to the command of the forces in
Flanders, was in the mean time appointed amba&s;&s;ador
extraordinary and plenipotentiary to their High-Mighti|ne&s;&s;es,
in order to per&s;uade them to co-operate vigorou&s;ly
in the plan which his Britannick Maje&s;ty had formed&mdash;A
plan by which Great-Britain was engaged as a principal
in a foreign di&s;pute, and entailed upon her&s;elf the whole
burthen of an expen&s;ive war, big with ruin and di&s;grace.
England, from being the umpire, was now become a party
<PB N="82" REF="86">
in all continental quarrels; and, in&s;tead of trimming the
balance of Europe, lavi&s;hed away her blood and trea&s;ure
in &s;upporting the intere&s;t and allies of a puny electorate in
the north of Germany. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia had been
at variance with the Elector of Hanover. The duchy of
Mecklenburgh was the avowed &s;ubject of di&s;pute: but his
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty is &s;aid to have had other more provoking
cau&s;es of complaint, which, however, he did not think
proper to divulge. The King of Great-Britain found it
convenient to accommodate the&s;e differences. In the cour&s;e
of this &s;ummer, the two powers concluded a convention,
in con&s;equence of which the troops of Hanover evacuated
Mecklenburgh, and three regiments of Brandenburgh took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e bailiwicks that were mortgaged to the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia. The electorate of Hanover being now
&s;ecured from danger, &s;ixteen thou&s;and troops of that coun|try,
together with the &s;ix thou&s;and auxiliary He&s;&s;ians,
began their march for the Netherlands; and about the
middle of October arrived in the neighbourhood of Bru&s;&s;els,
where they encamped. The Earl of Stair repaired to
Ghent, where the Briti&s;h forces were quartered: a body
of Au&s;trians was a&s;&s;embled; and though the &s;ea&s;on was
far advanced, he &s;eemed determined upon &s;ome expedition:
but all of a &s;udden the troops were &s;ent into winter-quarters.
The Au&s;trians retired to Luxembourg: the
Engli&s;h and He&s;&s;ians remained in Flanders; and the Ha|noverians
marched into the country of Liege, without pay|ing
any regard to the Bi&s;hop's prote&s;tation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The States-General had made a con&s;iderable
augmentation of their forces by &s;ea and land; but, not|with&s;tanding
the repeated in&s;tances of the Earl of Stair,
they re&s;olved to adhere to their neutrality: they dreaded
the neighbourhood of the French; and they were far from
being plea&s;ed to &s;ee the Engli&s;h get footing in the Nether|lands.
The friends of the Hou&s;e of Orange began to exert
them&s;elves: the &s;tates of Groningen and We&s;t-Frie&s;land
prote&s;ted, in favour of the Prince, again&s;t the promotion
of foreign generals which had lately been made: but his
<PB N="83" REF="87">
intere&s;t was powerfully oppo&s;ed by the provinces of Zea|land
and Holland, which had the greate&s;t weight in the
republick. The revolution in Ru&s;&s;ia did not put an end
to the war with Sweden. The&s;e two powers had agreed
to an armi&s;tice of three months, during which the Czarina
augmented her forces in Finland. She likewi&s;e ordered
the Counts O&s;terman and Munich, with their adherents,
to be tried: they were condemned to death, but pardoned
on the &s;caffold, and &s;ent in exile to Siberia. The Swedes,
&s;till encouraged by the intrigues of France, refu&s;ed to li&s;ten
to any terms of accommodation, unle&s;s Carelia, and the
other conque&s;ts of the Czar Peter, &s;hould be re&s;tored. The
French court had expected to bring over the new empre&s;s
to their mea&s;ures: but they found her as well di&s;po&s;ed as
her predece&s;&s;or to a&s;&s;i&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. She remitted
a con&s;iderable &s;um of money to the Queen of Hungary;
and at the &s;ame time congratulated the Elector of Bavaria
on his elevation to the imperial throne. The ceremony
of her coronation was performed in May, with great
&s;olemnity, at Mo&s;cow; and in November, &s;he declared
her nephew, the Duke of Hol&s;tein-Gottorp, her &s;ucce&s;&s;or,
by the title of Grand Prince of all the Ru&s;&s;ias. The ce&s;&s;a|tion
of arms being expired, General La&s;$y reduced Fre|derick&s;heim,
and obliged the Swedi&s;h army, commanded
by Count Lewenhaupt, to retire before him, from one place
to another, until at length they were quite &s;urrounded
near Hel&s;ingfors. In this emergency, the Swedi&s;h general
&s;ubmitted to a capitulation, by which his infantry were
tran&s;ported by &s;ea to Sweden; his cavalry marched by land
to Abo; and his artillery and magazines remained in the
hands of the Ru&s;&s;ians. The King of Sweden being of an
advanced age, the diet a&s;&s;embled in order to &s;ettle the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and the Duke of Hol&s;tein-Gottorp, as grand&s;on
to the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter to Charles XII. was declared next heir
to the crown. A courier was immediately di&s;patched to
Mo&s;cow, to notify to the Duke this determination of the
diet; and this me&s;&s;age was followed by a deputation: but
when they under&s;tood that he had embraced the religion
<PB N="84" REF="88">
of the Greek church, and been acknowledged &s;ucce&s;&s;or to
the throne of Ru&s;&s;ia, they annulled his election for Sweden,
and re&s;olved that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould not be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed,
until a peace &s;hould be concluded with the Czarina. Con|ferences
were opened at Abo for this purpo&s;e. In the
mean time, the events of war had been &s;o long unfortunate
for Sweden, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to appea&s;e the
indignation of the people with &s;ome &s;acrifice. The Gene|rals
Lewenhaupt and Bodenbrock were tried by a court|martial
for mi&s;conduct: being found guilty and condemned
to death, they appealed to the diet, by which the &s;entence
was confirmed. The term of the &s;ub&s;idy-treaty between
Great Britain and Denmark expiring, his Dani&s;h Maje&s;ty
refu&s;ed to renew it; nor would he accede to the peace of
Bre&s;lae. On the other hand, he became &s;ub&s;idiary to
France, with which al&s;o he concluded a new treaty of
commerce.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The Court of Ver&s;ailles were now heartily
tired of maintaining the war in Germany, and actu|ally
made equitable propo&s;als of peace to the Queen of Hun|gary,
by whom they were rejected. Thus repul&s;ed, they
redoubled their preparations, and endeavoured, by advan|tageous
offers, to detach the King of Sardinia from the in|tere&s;t
of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. This prince had e&s;pou&s;ed
a &s;i&s;ter of the Grand Duke, who pre&s;&s;ed him to declare
for her brother, and the Queen of Hungary promi&s;ed to
gratify him with &s;ome territories in the Milane&s;e;
be&s;ides, he thought the Spaniards had already gained too
much ground in Italy: but, at the &s;ame time, he was
afraid of being cru&s;hed between France and Spain, before
he could be properly &s;upported. He, therefore, tempori&s;ed,
and protracted the negociation, until he was alarmed at
the progre&s;s of the Spani&s;h arms in Italy, and fixed in his
determination by the &s;ub&s;idies of Great-Britain. The
Spani&s;h army a&s;&s;embled at Rimini, under the Duke de
Montemar; and being joined by the Neapolitan forces,
amounted to &s;ixty thou&s;and men, furni&s;hed with a large
train of artillery. About the beginning of May, they
<PB N="85" REF="89">
entered the Bologne&s;e: then the King of Sardinia declar|ing
again&s;t them, joined the Au&s;trian army commanded
by Count Traun; marched into the duchy of Parma;
and under&s;tanding that the Duke of Modena had engaged
in a treaty with the Spaniards, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that Prince of
his dominions. The Duke de Montemar, &s;eeing his army
dimini&s;hed by &s;ickne&s;s and de&s;ertion, retreated to the king|dom
of Naples, and was followed by the King of Sardinia,
as far as Rimini.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. Here he received intelligence, that Don Philip,
third &s;on of his Catholick Maje&s;ty, had made an irruption
into Savoy with another army of Spaniards, and already
taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Chamberri, the capital. He forthwith
began his march for Piedmont. Don Philip abandoned
Savoy at his approach, and retreating into Dauphine,
took po&s;t under the cannon of fort Barreaux. The King
pur&s;ued him thither, and both armies remained in &s;ight
of each other till the month of December, when the Mar|quis
de Minas, an active and enterpri&s;ing general, arrived
from Madrid, and took upon him the command of the
forces under Don Philip. This general's fir&s;t exploit
was again&s;t the ca&s;tle of A&s;premont, in the neighbourhood
of the Sardinian camp. He attacked it &s;o vigorou&s;ly that
the garri&s;on was obliged to capitulate in four and forty
hours. The lo&s;s of this important po&s;t compelled the
King to retire into Piedmont, and the Spaniards marched
back into Savoy, where they e&s;tabli&s;hed their winter-quarters.
In the mean time, the Duke de Montemar,
who directed the other Spani&s;h army, though the Duke of
Modena was nominal generali&s;&s;imo, re&s;igned his command
to Count Gages, who attempted to penetrate into Tu&s;ca|ny;
but was prevented by the vigilance of Count Traun,
the Au&s;trian general. In December he quartered his troops
in the Bologne&s;e and Romagna; while the Au&s;trians and
Piedmonte&s;e were di&s;tributed in the Moderne&s;e and Par|me&s;an.
The Pope was pa&s;&s;ive during the whole cam|paign:
the Venetians maintained their neutrality and
the King of the two Sicilies was over-awed by the Briti&s;h
fleet in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="90">
&sect; XXXII. The new mini&s;try in England had &s;ent out
Admiral Matthews to a&s;&s;ume the command of this &s;quadron,
which had been for &s;ome time conducted by Le&s;tock, an
inferior officer, as Haddock had been obliged to re&s;ign his
commi&s;&s;ion, on account of his ill &s;tate of health. Mat|thews
was likewi&s;e inve&s;ted with the character of mini&s;ter-plenipotentiary
to the King of Sardinia and the &s;tates of
Italy. Immediately after he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
command, he ordered Captain Norris to de&s;troy five Spa|ni&s;h
gallies which had put into the bay of St. Tropez;
and this &s;ervice was effectually performed. In May he
detached Commodore Rowley, with eight &s;ail, to crui&s;e
off the harbour of Toulon; and a great number of mer|chant
&s;hips belonging to the enemy fell into his hands.
In Augu&s;t he &s;ent Commodore Martin with another &s;qua|dron
into the bay of Naples, to bombard that city, unle&s;s
his Sicilian Maje&s;ty would immediately recall his troops,
which had joined the Spani&s;h army, and promi&s;e to remain
neuter during the continuance of the war. Naples was
immediately filled with con&s;ternation: the King &s;ub&s;cribed
to the&s;e conditions; and the Engli&s;h &s;quadron rejoined the
admiral in the road of Hieres, which he had cho&s;en for his
winter &s;tation. Before this period he had landed &s;ome
men at St. Remo, in the territories of Genoa, and de&s;troy|ed
the magazines that were erected for the u&s;e of the Spa|ni&s;h
army. He had likewi&s;e ordered two of his crui&s;ers to
attack a Spani&s;h &s;hip of the line which lay at anchor in
the port of Ajaccio, in the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica: but the Spa|ni&s;h
captain &s;et his men on &s;hore, and blew up his &s;hip,
rather than he &s;hould fall into the hands of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. In the cour&s;e of this year Admiral Vernon
and General Wentworth made another effort in the We&s;t-Indies.
They had in January received a re-enforcement
from England, and planned a new expedition, in concert
with the governor of Jamaica, who accompanied them in
the voyage. Their de&s;ign was to di&s;embark the troops at
Porto-Bello; and march acro&s;s the i&s;thmus of Darien, to
attack the rich town of Panama: They &s;ailed from
<PB N="87" REF="91">
Jamaica on the ninth day of March, and on the twenty-eighth
arrived at Porto-Bello. There they held a council
of war, in which it was re&s;olved, that as the troops were
&s;ickly, the rainy &s;ea&s;on begun, and &s;everal tran&s;ports not
yet arrived, the intended expedition was become impracti|cable.
In pur&s;uance of this determination the armament
immediately returned to Jamaica, exhibiting a ridiculous
&s;pectacle of folly and irre&s;olution<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>In May two Engli&s;h frigates, commanded by Captain Smith and Captain Stuart, fell in with three Spani&s;h &s;hips of war, near the i&s;land of St. Chri|&s;topher's. They forthwith engaged, and the action continued till night, by the favour of which the enemy retired to Porto-Rico in a &s;hattered condition.</P>
<P>In the month of September the Tilbury &s;hip of war, of &s;ixty-guns, was accidentally &s;et on fire, and de&s;troyed, off the i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola: on which occa&s;ion one hundred and twenty &s;even men peri&s;hed; the re&s;t were &s;aved by Capt. Hoare of the De&s;iance, who happened to be on the &s;ame crui&s;e.</P></NOTE>. In Augu&s;t a &s;hip of
war was &s;ent from thence, with about three hundred
&s;oldiers, to the &s;mall i&s;land Rattan, in the bay of Honduras,
of which they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In September Vernon and
Wentworth received orders to return to England with &s;uch
troops as remained alive: the&s;e did not amount to a tenth
part of the number which had been &s;ent abroad in that in|glorious
&s;ervice. The inferior officers fell ignobly by
&s;ickne&s;s and de&s;pair, without an opportunity of &s;ignalizing
their courage, and the commanders lived to feel the &s;corn
and reproach of their country. In the month of June the
new colony of Georgia was invaded by an armament from
St. Augu&s;tine, commanded by Don Marinel de Montea|no,
governor of that fortre&s;s. It con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix-and-thir|ty
&s;hips, from which four thou&s;and men were landed at St.
Simon's; and began their march for Frederica. General
Oglethorpe, with a handful of men, took &s;uch wi&s;e pre|cautions
for oppo&s;ing their progre&s;s, and harra&s;&s;ed them in
their march with &s;uch activity and re&s;olution, that after
two of their detachments had been defeated, they retired
to their &s;hips, and totally abandoned the enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. In England the merchants &s;till com|plained
that their commerce was not properly protected,
and the people clamoured again&s;t the conduct of the war.
<PB N="88" REF="92">
They &s;aid their burthens were increa&s;ed to maintain quarrels
with which they had no concern; to defray the enormous
expen&s;e of inactive fleets and pacific armies. Lord C. had
by this time in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the confidence of
his &s;overeign, and engro&s;&s;ed the whole direction of pub|lick
affairs. The war with Spain was now become a &s;e|condary
con&s;ideration, and neglected accordingly; while
the chief attention of the new mini&s;ter was turned
upon the affairs of the continent. The di&s;pute with Spain
concerned Britain only. The intere&s;ts of Hanover were
connected with the troubles of the empire. By pur&s;uing
this object he &s;oothed the wi&s;hes of his ma&s;ter, and
opened a more ample field for his own ambition. He had
&s;tudied the policy of the continent with peculiar eagerne&s;s.
This was the favourite &s;ubject of his reflexion, upon which
he thought and &s;poke with a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m. The
intolerable taxes, the poverty, the ruined commerce
of his country, the iniquity of &s;tanding armies, votes of
credit, and foreign connections, upon which he had &s;o
often expatiated, were now forgotten, or overlooked.
He &s;aw nothing but glory, conque&s;t, and acquired do|minion.
He &s;et the power of France at de&s;iance; and,
as if Great-Britain had felt no di&s;tre&s;s, but teemed with
trea&s;ure which &s;he could not otherwi&s;e employ, he poured
forth her millions with a ra&s;h and de&s;perate hand, in
purcha&s;ing beggarly allies, and maintaining mercenary ar|mies.
The Earl of Stair had arrived in England towards
the end of Augu&s;t, and conferred with his Maje&s;ty. A
privy-council was &s;ummoned; and in a few days that
nobleman returned to Holland. Lord Carteret was &s;ent
with a commi&s;&s;ion to the Hague in September; and when
he returned, the baggage of the King and the Duke of
Cumberland, which had been &s;hipped for Flanders, was
ordered to be brought on &s;hore. The parliament met
on the &s;ixteenth day of November, when his Maje&s;ty told
them, that he had augmented the Briti&s;h forces in the
Low-Countries with &s;ixteen thou&s;and Hanoverians and
the He&s;&s;ian auxiliaries, in order to form &s;uch a force, in
<PB N="89" REF="93">
conjunction with the Au&s;trian troops, as might be of
&s;ervice to the common cau&s;e at all events. He extolled
the magnanimity and fortitude of the Queen of Hungary,
as well as the re&s;olute conduct of the King of Sardinia,
and that prince's &s;trict adherence to his engagements,
though attacked in his own dominions. He mentioned
the requi&s;ition made by Sweden, of his good offices for
procuring a peace between that nation and Ru&s;&s;ia; the
defen&s;ive alliances which he had concluded with the Cza|rina,
and with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, as events which could
not have been expected, if Great-Britain had not mani|fe&s;ted
a &s;ea&s;onable &s;pirit and vigour, in defence and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of her ancient allies, and in maintaining the liber|ties
of Europe. He &s;aid, the honour and intere&s;t of his
crown and kingdoms, the &s;ucce&s;s of the war with Spain,
the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the balance and tranquillity of
Europe would greatly depend on the prudence and vigour
of their re&s;olutions. The Marquis of Tweedale moved
for an addre&s;s of thanks, which was oppo&s;ed by the Earl
of Che&s;terfield, for the rea&s;ons &s;o often urged on the &s;ame
occa&s;ion; but &s;upported by Lord C. on his new-adopted
maxims, with tho&s;e &s;pecious arguments which he could
at all times produce, delivered with amazing &s;erenity and
a&s;&s;urance. The motion was agreed to, and the addre&s;s
pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty. About this period a treaty of
mutual defence and guarantee between his Maje&s;ty and
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was &s;igned at We&s;tmin&s;ter. In the
Hou&s;e of Commons Mr. Lyttelton made a motion for re|viving
the place-bill; but it was oppo&s;ed by a great num|ber
of members who had formerly been &s;trenuous ad|vocates
for this mea&s;ure, and rejected upon a divi&s;ion.
This was al&s;o the fate of a motion made to renew the en|quiry
into the conduct of Robert Earl of Orford. As
many &s;trong pre&s;umptions of guilt had appeared again&s;t
him in the reports of the &s;ecret committee, the na|tion
had rea&s;on to expect that this propo&s;al would have
been embraced by a great majority: but &s;everal members,
who in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion had been loud in their de|mands
<PB N="90" REF="94">
of ju&s;tice, now &s;hamefully contributed their ta|lents
and intere&s;t in &s;tifling the enquiry.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. When the Hou&s;e of Lords took into con&s;i|deration
the &s;everal e&s;timates of the expen&s;e occa&s;ioned
by the forces in the pay of Great-Britain, Earl Stanhope,
at the clo&s;e of an elegant &s;peech, moved for an addre&s;s, to
be&s;eech and advi&s;e his Maje&s;ty, that, in compa&s;&s;ion to his
people, loaded already with &s;uch numerous and heavy
taxes, &s;uch large and growing debts, and greater annual
expen&s;es than the nation at any time before had ever
&s;u&s;tained, he would exonerate his &s;ubjects of the charge
and burden of tho&s;e mercenaries who were taken into the
&s;ervice la&s;t year, without the advice or con&s;ent of par|liament.
The motion was &s;upported by the Earl of
Sandwich, who took occa&s;ion to &s;peak with great con|tempt
of Hanover, and in mentioning the royal family,
&s;eemed to forget that decorum which the &s;ubject required.
He had, indeed, rea&s;on to talk with a&s;perity on the con|tract
by which the Hanoverians had been taken into the
pay of Great-Britain. Levy-money was charged to the
account, though they were engaged for one year only;
and though not a &s;ingle regiment had been rai&s;ed on this
occa&s;ion: they had been levied for the &s;ecurity of the
electorate; and would have been maintained if England
had never engaged in the affairs of the continent. The
Duke of Bedford enlarged upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. He
&s;aid it had been &s;u&s;pected, nor was the &s;u&s;picion without
foundation, that the mea&s;ures of the Engli&s;h mini&s;try had
long been regulated by the intere&s;t of his Maje&s;ty's elec|toral
territories: that the&s;e had been long con&s;idered as a
gulf into which the trea&s;ures of Great-Britain had been
thrown: that the &s;tate of Hanover had been changed
without any vi&s;ible cau&s;e, &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of its
princes to the throne of England: affluence had begun to
wanton in their towns, and gold to glitter in their cot|tages,
without the di&s;covery of mines, or the increa&s;e of
their commerce; and new dominions had been purcha&s;ed,
of which the value was never paid from the revenues of
<PB N="91" REF="95">
Hanover&punc; The motion was hunted down by the new
mini&s;ter, the patriot Lord Bathur&s;t, and the Earl of
Bath, which la&s;t nobleman declared, that he con&s;idered
it as an act of cowardice and meanne&s;s, to fall pa&s;&s;ive|ly
down the &s;tream of popularity, to &s;uffer his rea&s;on and
integrity to be overborn by the noi&s;e of vulgar clamours,
which had been rai&s;ed again&s;t the mea&s;ures of government
by the low arts of exaggeration, fallacious rea&s;onings,
and partial repre&s;entations. This is the very language
which Sir Robert Walpole had often u&s;ed again&s;t Mr.
Pulteney and his confederates in the Hou&s;e of Commons.
The a&s;&s;ociates of the new &s;ecretary pleaded the cau&s;e of
Hanover, and in&s;i&s;ted upon the nece&s;&s;ity of a land war
again&s;t France, with all the vehemence of declamation.
Their &s;ugge&s;tions were an&s;wered; their conduct was &s;e|verely
&s;tigmatized by the Earl of Che&s;terfield, who ob|&s;erved,
that the a&s;&s;embling an army in Flanders, without
the concurrence of the States-General, or any other
power engaged by treaty, or bound by intere&s;t, to &s;up|port
the Queen of Hungary, was a ra&s;h and ridiculous
mea&s;ure: the taking &s;ixteen thou&s;and Hanoverians into
Briti&s;h pay, without con&s;ulting the parliament, &s;eemed
highly derogatory to the rights and dignity of the great
council of the nation, and a very dangerous precedent to
future times: that the&s;e troops could not be employed
again&s;t the Emperor, whom they had already recognized:
that the arms and wealth of Britain alone were altogether
in&s;ufficient to rai&s;e the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria to its former
&s;trength, dominion, and influence: that the a&s;&s;embling
an army in Flanders would engage the nation as princi|pals
in an expen&s;ive and ruinous war, with a power
which it ought not to provoke, and could not pretend
to with&s;tand in that manner: that while Great-Britain
exhau&s;ted her&s;elf almo&s;t to ruin, in pur&s;uance of &s;chemes
founded on engagements to the Queen of Hungary, the
electorate of Hanover, though under the &s;ame engage|ments,
and governed by the &s;ame prince, did not appear
to contribute any thing as an ally to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but
was paid by Great-Britain for all the forces it had &s;ent into
<PB N="92" REF="96">
the field, at a very exorbitant price: that nothing could
be more ab&s;urd and iniquitous than to hire the&s;e merce|naries,
while a numerous army lay inactive at home;
and the nation groaned under &s;uch intolerable burthens
&startq;It may be proper (added he) to repeat what may be
forgotten in the multitude of other objects, that this
nation, after having exalted the Elector of Hanover
from a &s;tate of ob&s;curity to the crown, is condemned
to hire the troops of that electorate to fight their own
cau&s;e; to hire them at a rate which was never demanded
before; and to pay levy-money for them, though it
is known to all Europe that they were not rai&s;ed for
this occa&s;ion.&endq; All the parti&s;ans of the old mi|ni&s;try
joined in the oppo&s;ition to Earl Stanhope's mo|tion,
which was rejected by the majority. Then the
Earl of Scarborough moved for an addre&s;s, to approve of
the mea&s;ures which had been taken on the continent; and
this was likewi&s;e carried by dint of number. It was not,
however, a very eligible victory: what they gained in
parliament they lo&s;t with the people. The new mini|&s;ters
became more odious than their predece&s;&s;ors; and
people began to think that publick virtue was an empty
name.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. But the mo&s;t &s;evere oppo&s;ition they under|went
was in their endeavours to &s;upport a bill which they
had concerted, and which had pa&s;&s;ed through the Hou&s;e
of Commons with great precipitation: it repealed certain
duties on &s;pirituous liquors; and licen&s;es for retail|ing
the&s;e liquors; and impo&s;ed others at an ea&s;ier
rate. When tho&s;e &s;evere duties, amounting almo&s;t to a
prohibition, were impo&s;ed, the populace of London were
&s;unk into the mo&s;t brutal degeneracy, by drinking to
exce&s;s the pernicious &s;pirit called Gin, which was &s;old &s;o
cheap, that the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of the people could afford to in|dulge
them&s;elves in one continued &s;tate of intoxication,
to the de&s;truction of all morals, indu&s;try, and order.
Such a &s;hameful degree of profligacy prevailed, that the
retailers of this poi&s;onous compound &s;et up painted boards
in publick, inviting people to be drunk for the &s;mall ex|pen&s;e
<PB N="93" REF="97">
of one penny; a&s;&s;uring them they might be dead
drunk for two-pence, and have &s;traw for nothing. They
accordingly provided cellars and places &s;trewed with &s;traw,
to which they conveyed tho&s;e wretches who were over|whelmed
with intoxication. In the&s;e di&s;mal caverns they
lay until they recovered &s;ome u&s;e of their faculties, and
then they had recour&s;e to the &s;ame mi&s;chievous po|tion;
thus con&s;uming their health, and ruining their
families in hideous receptacles of the mo&s;t filthy vice,
re&s;ounding with riot, execration, and bla&s;phemy. Such
bea&s;tly practices too plainly denoted a total want of all
police and civil regulation, and would have reflected di&s;|grace
upon the mo&s;t barbarous community. In order to
re&s;train this evil, which was become intolerable, the legi|&s;lature
enacted that law which we have already mentioned.
But the populace &s;oon broke through all re&s;traint. Though
no licence was obtained, and no duty paid, the liquor
continued to be &s;old in all corners of the &s;treets: inform|ers
were intimidated by the threats of the people; and
the ju&s;tices of the peace, either from indolence or cor|ruption,
neglected to put the law in execution. The
new mini&s;ters fore&s;aw that a great revenue would
accrue to the crown from a repeal of this act; and this
mea&s;ure they thought they might the more decently take,
as the law had proved ineffectual: for it appeared that
the con&s;umption of gin had con&s;iderably increa&s;ed every
year &s;ince tho&s;e heavy duties were impo&s;ed. They, there|fore,
pretended, that &s;hould the price of the liquor be
moderately rai&s;ed, and licences granted at twenty &s;hil|lings
each to the retailers, the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of people
would be debarred the u&s;e of it to exce&s;s: their morals
would of con&s;equence be mended; and a con&s;iderable
&s;um of money might be rai&s;ed for the &s;upport of the war,
by mortaging the revenue ari&s;ing from the duty and the
licences. Upon the&s;e maxims the new bill was founded,
and pa&s;&s;ed through the Lower Hou&s;e without oppo&s;ition:
but among the Peers it produced the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate di&s;|pute
which had happened &s;ince the beginning of this par|liament.
<PB N="94" REF="98">
The fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault it &s;u&s;tained was from Lord
Hervey, who had been dive&s;ted of his po&s;t of privy-&s;eal,
which was be&s;towed on Lord Gower; and the&s;e two no|blemen
exchanged principles from that in&s;tant. The fir&s;t
was hardened into a &s;turdy patriot; the other &s;uppled into
an ob&s;equious courtier. Lord Hervey, on this occa&s;ion,
made a florid harangue upon the pernicious effects of
that de&s;tructive &s;pirit they were about to let loo&s;e upon
their fellow-creatures. Several prelates expatiated on the
&s;ame topicks: but the Earl of Che&s;terfield attacked the
bill with the united powers of rea&s;on, wit, and ridicule.
Lord Carteret, Lord Bathur&s;t, and the Earl of Bath
were numbered among its advocates; and &s;hrewd argu|ments
were advanced on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion. After
very long, warm, and repeated debates, the bill pa&s;&s;ed
without amendments, though the whole bench of bi&s;hops
voted again&s;t it; and we cannot help owning, that it has
not been attended with tho&s;e di&s;mal con&s;equences which
the lords in the oppo&s;ition foretold. When the que&s;tion
was put for committing this bill, and the Earl of Che&s;ter|field
&s;aw the bi&s;hops join in his divi&s;ion, &startq;I am in doubt
(&s;aid he) whether I have not got on the other &s;ide of
the que&s;tion; for I have not had the honour to divide
with &s;o many lawn &s;leeves for &s;everal years.&endq;</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. By the report of the &s;ecret committee it
appeared that the then mini&s;ter had commenced pro&s;ecu|tions
again&s;t the mayors of boroughs who oppo&s;ed his
influence in the elections of members of parliament.
The&s;e pro&s;ecutions were founded on ambiguities in char|ters,
or trival informalities in the choice of magi&s;trates.
An appeal on &s;uch a proce&s;s was brought into the Hou&s;e
of Lords; and this evil falling under con&s;ideration, a
bill was prepared for &s;ecuring the independency of cor|porations:
but as it tended to dimini&s;h the influence of
the mini&s;try, they argued again&s;t it with their u&s;ual eager|ne&s;s
and &s;ucce&s;s: and it was rejected on a divi&s;ion. The
mutiny-bill and &s;everal others pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es.
The Commons granted &s;upplies to the amount of &s;ix
<PB N="95" REF="99">
millions, rai&s;ed by the land tax, the malt tax, duties on
&s;pirituous liquors, and licences, and a loan from the &s;ink|ing-fund.
In two years the national debt had &s;uffered an
increa&s;e of two millions four hundred thou&s;and pounds.
On the twenty-fir&s;t day of April the &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed in
the u&s;ual manner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1743</NOTE> The King, in his &s;peech to both Hou&s;es,
told them, that, at the requi&s;ition of the Queen of Hun|gary,
he had ordered his army, in conjunction with the
Au&s;trians, to pa&s;s the Rhine for her &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance:
that he continued one &s;quadron of &s;hips in the Mediterra|nean,
and another in the We&s;t-Indies. He thanked the
Commons for the ample &s;upplies they had granted; and
declared it was the fixed purpo&s;e of his heart to promote
the true intere&s;t and happine&s;s of his kingdoms. Imme|diately
after the prorogation of parliament he embarked for
Germany, accompanied by the Duke of Cumberland, Lord
Carteret, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. At this period the Queen of Hungary
&s;eemed to triumph over all her enemies. The French
were driven out of Bohemia and part of the Upper-Pala|tinate;
and their forces under Mare&s;chal Broglio were
po&s;ted on the Danube. Prince Charles of Lorraine, at the
head of the Au&s;trian army entered Bavaria; and in April
obtained a victory over a body of Bavarians at Braunau:
at the &s;ame time, three bodies of Croatians penetrating
through the pa&s;&s;es of the Tyroleze, ravaged the open coun|try
to the very gates of Munich. The Emperor pre&s;&s;ed
the French general to hazard a battle; but he refu&s;ed to
run this ri&s;que, though he had received a &s;trong re-enforce|ment
from France. His Imperial Maje&s;ty, thinking him|&s;elf
un&s;afe in Munich, retired to Augu&s;burgh: Mare&s;chal
Seckendorf retreated with the Bavarian troops to Ingold|&s;tadt,
where he was afterwards joined by Mare&s;chal Broglio,
who&s;e troops had in this retreat been pur&s;ued and terribly
harra&s;&s;ed by the Au&s;trian cavalry and hu&s;&s;ars. Prince
Charles had opened a free communication with Munich,
which now for the third time fell into the hands of the
Queen of Hungary. Her arms likewi&s;e reduced Friedberg
<PB N="96" REF="100">
and Land&s;perg; while Prince Charles continued to pur&s;u$$
the French to Donawert, where they were joined by twelve
thou&s;and men from the Rhine. Broglio &s;till avoided an$
engagement, and retreated before the enemy to Hailbron
The Emperor being thus abandoned by his allies, and
&s;tripped of all his dominions, repaired to Franckfort, where
he lived in indigence and ob&s;curity. He now made ad|vances
towards an accommodation with the Queen of
Hungary. His general, Seckendorf, had an interview
with Count Khevenhuller at the convent of Lower&s;con|field,
where a convention was &s;igned. This treaty im|ported,
That the Emperor &s;hould remain neuter during the
continuance of the pre&s;ent war; and That his troop$
&s;hould be quartered in Franconia: That the Queen of
Hungary &s;hould keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bavaria till the peace&punc;
That Braunau and Scharding &s;hould be delivered up to
the Au&s;trians: That the French garri&s;on of Ingold&s;tad$
&s;hould be permitted to withdraw, and be replaced by
Bavarians; but that the Au&s;trian generals &s;hould be put
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the artillery, magazines, and warlike
&s;tores belonging to the French, which &s;hould be found it
the place. The government of Egra and Ingold&s;tadt re|fu&s;ing
to acquie&s;ce in the capitulation, the Au&s;trians had
recour&s;e to the operations of war; and both places were
reduced. In Ingold&s;tadt they found all the Emperor
dome&s;tick trea&s;ure, jewels, plate, pictures, cabinets, and
curio&s;ities, with the archives of the hou&s;e of Bavaria, the
mo&s;t valuable effects belonging to the nobility of that
electorate, a prodigious train of artillery, and a va&s;t quan|tity
of provi&s;ions, arms, and ammunition.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The French King, baffled in all the e&s;&s;o$$
he had hitherto made for the &s;upport of the Emperor,
ordered his mini&s;ter at Franckfort to deliver a declaration
to the diet, profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf extremely well plea&s;ed to
hear they intended to interpo&s;e their mediation for termi|nating
the war. He &s;aid, he was no le&s;s &s;atisfied with the
treaty of neutrality which the Emperor had concluded
with the Queen of Hungary; an event of which he was
<PB N="97" REF="101">
no &s;ooner informed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VII. 1743.</NOTE> than he had ordered his troops to return
to the frontiers of his dominions, that the Germanick body
might be convinced of his equity and moderation. To
this declaration the Queen of Hungary an&s;wered in a re|&s;cript,
that the de&s;ign of France was to embarra&s;s her affairs,
and deprive her of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her allies: that the
Elector of Bavaria could not be con&s;idered as a neutral
party in his own cau&s;e: that the mediation of the empire
could only produce a peace either with or without the con|currence
of France: that in the former ca&s;e no &s;olid peace
could be expected; in the latter, it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that
France would pay no regard to a peace in which &s;he
&s;hould have no concern. She affirmed, that the aim of the
French King was &s;olely to gain time to repair his lo&s;&s;es,
that he might afterwards revive the troubles of the empire.
The Elector of Mentz, who had favoured the Emperor,
was now dead, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or inclined to the Au&s;trian
intere&s;t. He allowed this re&s;cript to be entered in the
journal of the diet, together with the prote&s;ts which had
been made when the vote of Bohemia was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in
the late election. The Emperor complained in a circular
letter of this tran&s;action, as a &s;troke levelled at his Imperial
dignity; and it gave ri&s;e to a warm di&s;pute among the
members of the Germanick body. Several princes re&s;ented
the haughty conduct, and began to be alarmed at the &s;uc|ce&s;s
of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; while others pitied the de|plorable
&s;ituation of the Emperor. The King of Great-Britain
and Pru&s;&s;ia, as Electors of Hanover and Branden|burgh,
e&s;pou&s;ed oppo&s;ite &s;ides in this conte&s;t. His Pru&s;&s;ian
Maje&s;ty prote&s;ted again&s;t the inve&s;titure of the duchy of
Saxe-Lawenburgh, claimed by the King of Great Britain:
he had an interview with General Seckendorf at An&s;pach;
and was &s;aid to have privately vi&s;ited the Emperor at
Franckfort.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. The troops which the King of Great-Britain
had a&s;&s;embled in the Netherlands began their march for
the Rhine in the latter end of February; and in May they
encamped near Hoech on the river Mayne, under the com|mand
<PB N="98" REF="102">
of the Earl of Stair.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK. II. 1743.</NOTE> This nobleman &s;ent Major-General
Bland to Franckfort, with a compliment to the
Emperor, a&s;&s;uring him, in the name of his Britannic$k
Maje&s;ty, that the re&s;pect owing to his dignity &s;hould not
be violated, nor the place of his re&s;idence di&s;turbed. Not|with&s;tanding
this a&s;&s;urance, the Emperor retired to Munich,
though he was afterwards compelled to return, by the &s;uc|ce&s;s
of the Au&s;trians in Bavaria. The French King, in
order to prevent the junction of the Briti&s;h forces with
Prince Charles of Lorraine, ordered the Mare&s;chal de
Noailles to a&s;&s;emble &s;ixty thou&s;and men upon the Mayne;
while Coigny was &s;ent into Al&s;ace with a numerous army,
to defend that province, and oppo&s;e Prince Charles, &s;hould
he attempt to pa&s;s the Rhine. The Mare&s;chal de Noailles,
having &s;ecured the towns of Spire, Worms, and Oppen|heim,
pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine in the beginning of June, and
po&s;ted him&s;elf on the ea&s;t &s;ide of that river, above Franck|fort.
The Earl of Stair advanced towards him, and en|camped
at Killenbach, between the river Mayne and the
fore&s;t of D' Arm&s;tate: from this &s;ituation he made a mo|tion
to A&s;chaffenburgh, with a view to &s;ecure the naviga|tion
of the Upper Mayne: but he was anticipated by the
enemy, who lay on the other &s;ide of the river, and had
taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the po&s;ts above, &s;o as to intercept al$
&s;upplies. They were po&s;ted on the other &s;ide of the river
oppo&s;ite to the allies, who&s;e camp they overlooked; an$
they found means, by their parties and other precautions
to cut off the communication by water between Franck|fort
and the confederates. The Duke of Cumberland ha$
already come to make his fir&s;t campaign, and his Maje&s;ty
arrived in the camp on the ninth day of June. He foun$
his army, amounting to about forty thou&s;and men, in dange$
of &s;tarving: he received intelligence, that a re-enforcemens
of twelve thou&s;and Hanoverians and He&s;&s;ians had reache$
Hanau; and he re&s;olved to march thither, both with a view
to effect the junction, and to procure provi&s;ion for hi$
forces. With this view he decamped on the twenty-&s;ixt$
day of June. He had no &s;ooner quitted A&s;chaffenburgh
<PB N="99" REF="103">
than it was &s;ei&s;ed by the French general: he had not
marched above three leagues, when he perceived the ene|my,
to the number of thirty thou&s;and, had pa&s;&s;ed the river
farther down, at Selingen&s;tadt, and were drawn up in order
of battle at the village of Dettingen, to di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age.
Thus he found him&s;elf cooped up in a very dangerous
&s;ituation. The enemy had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of A&s;chaf|fenburgh
behind, &s;o as to prevent his retreat, his troops
were confined in a narrow plain, bounded by hills and
woods on the right, flanked on the left by the river Mayne,
on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of which the French had erected bat|teries
that annoyed the allies on their march: in the front
a con&s;iderable part of the French army was drawn up,
with a narrow pa&s;s before them, the village of Dettingen
on their right, a wood on their left, and a mora&s;s in the
centre. Thus environed, the confederates mu&s;t either
have fought at a very great di&s;advantage, or &s;urrendered
them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, had not the Duke de Gramont,
who commanded the enemy, been in&s;tigated by the &s;pirit of
madne&s;s to forego the&s;e advantages. He pa&s;&s;ed the defile,
and advancing towards the allies, a battle en&s;ued. The
French hor&s;e charged with great impetuo&s;ity, and &s;ome
regiments of Briti&s;h cavalry were put in di&s;order: but the
infantry of the allies behaved with &s;uch intrepidity and de|liberation,
under the eye of their &s;overeign, as &s;oon deter|mined
the fate of the day: the French were obliged to give
way, and repa&s;s the Mayne with great precipitation, hav|ing
lo&s;t about five thou&s;and men killed, wounded, or taken.
Had they been properly pur&s;ued before they recollected
them&s;elves from their fir&s;t confu&s;ion, in all probability they
would have &s;u&s;tained a total overthrow. The Earl of
Stair propo&s;ed that a body of cavalry &s;hould be detached
on this &s;ervice; but his advice was over-ruled. The lo&s;s
of the allies in this action amounted to two thou&s;and men.
The Generals Clayton and Monroy were killed: the Duke
of Cumberland, who exhibited uncommon proofs of cou|rage,
was &s;hot through the calf of the leg: the Earl of
Albemarle, General Hu&s;ke, and &s;everal other officers of

di&s;tinction, were wounded. The King expo&s;ed his per&s;o$
to a &s;evere fire of cannon as well as mu&s;quetry: he rod$
between the fir&s;t and &s;econd lines with his &s;word drawn
and encouraged the troops to fight for the honour o$
England. Immediately after the action he continued hi$
march to Hanau, where he was joined by the re-enforce|ment.
The Earl of Stair &s;ent a trumpet to Mare&s;chal $word$
Noailles, recommending to his protection the &s;ick an$
wounded that were left on the field of battle; and the&s;$
the French general treated with great care and tenderne&s;s
Such genero&s;ity &s;oftens the rigours of war, and does honou$
to humanity.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. The two armies continued on different &s;ides o$
the river till the twelfth day of July, when the French
general receiving intelligence that Prince Charles of Lor$raine
had approached the Neckar, he &s;uddenly retired, and
repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine between Worms and Oppenheim$
The King of Great-Britain was vi&s;ited by Prince Charles
and Count Khevenhuller at Hanau, where the future ope|rations
of the campaign were regulated. On the twenty-&s;eventh
day of Augu&s;t, the allied army pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine a$
Mentz, and the King fixed his head-quarters in the epi&s;co|pal
palace at Worms. Here the forces lay encamped til$
the latter end of September, when they advanced to Spire,
where they were joined by twenty thou&s;and Dutch auxil|iaries
from the Netherlands. Mere&s;chal Noailles having
retreated into Upper Al&s;ace, the allies took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Germer&s;heim, and demoli&s;hed the entrenchments which
the enemy had rai&s;ed on the Queich: then they returned
to Mentz, and in October were di&s;tributed into winter-quarters,
after an inactive campaign that redounded very
little to the honour of tho&s;e by whom the motions of the
army were conducted. In September a treaty had been
concluded at Worms between his Britannick Maje&s;ty,
the King of Sardinia, and the Queen of Hungary. She
engaged to maintain thirty thou&s;and men in Italy: the
King of Sardinia obliged him&s;elf to employ forty thou&s;and
infantry and five thou&s;and hor&s;e, in con&s;ideration of his
<PB N="101" REF="107">
commanding the combined army, and receiving an annual
&s;ub&s;idy of two hundred thou&s;and pounds from Great-Britain.
As a further gratification, the Queen yielded to
him the city of Placentia, with &s;everal di&s;tricts in the
duchy of Pavia, and in the Novare&s;e; and all her right
and preten&s;ions to Final, at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the
republick of Genoa, which, they hoped, would give it
up, on being repaid the purcha&s;e-money, amounting to
three hundred thou&s;and pounds. This &s;um the King of
England promi&s;ed to di&s;bur&s;e; and moreover to maintain
a &s;trong &s;quadron in the Mediterranean, the commander
of which &s;hould act in concert with his Sardinian Maje&s;ty.
Finally, the contracting powers agreed, That Final &s;hould
be con&s;tituted a free-port, like that of Leghorn. Nothing
could be more unju&s;t than this treaty, by which the
Genoe&s;e were negociated out of their property. They
had purcha&s;ed the marqui&s;ate of Final of the late Emperor
for a valuable con&s;ideration, and the purcha&s;e had been
guaranteed by Great-Britain. It could not, therefore, be
expected that they would part with this acqui&s;ition to a
Prince who&s;e power they thought already too formidable;
&s;pecially, on condition of its being made a free-port, to
the prejudice of their own commerce. They pre&s;ented
remon&s;trances again&s;t this article, by their mini&s;ters at the
courts of London, Vienna, and Turin; and as very little
regard was paid to their repre&s;entations, they threw them|&s;elves
into the arms of France and Spain for protection.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. After the battle of Dettingen, Colonel Mentzel,
a$ the head of a large body of irregulars belonging to the
Queen of Hungary, made an irruption into Lorraine,
part of which they ravaged without mercy. In September
Prince Charles, with the Au&s;trian army, entered the Bri&s;|gaw,
and attempted to pa&s;s the Rhine; but Mare&s;chal
Coigny had taken &s;uch precautions for guarding it on the
other &s;ide, that he was obliged to abandon his de&s;ign, and
marching back into the Upper Palatinate, quartered his
troops in that country, and in Bavaria. By this time the
Earl of Stair had &s;ollicited and obtained leave to re&s;ign his
<PB N="102" REF="108">
command. He had for &s;ome time thought him&s;elf ne|glected;
and was unwilling that his reputation &s;hould &s;uffer
on account of mea&s;ures in which he had no concern. In
October the King of Great-Britain returned to Hanover,
and the army &s;eparated. The troops in Briti&s;h pay
marched back to the Netherlands, and the re&s;t took the
route to their re&s;pective countries. The States-General
&s;till wavered between their own immediate intere&s;t and
their de&s;ire to &s;upport the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. At length,
however, they &s;upplied her with a &s;ub&s;idy, and ordered
twenty thou&s;and men to march to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, notwith|&s;tanding
the intrigues of the Marquis de Fenelon, the
French amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, and the declaration of
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who di&s;approved of this mea&s;ure, and
refu&s;ed them a pa&s;&s;age through his territories, to the Rhine.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. Sweden was filled with di&s;contents, and divid|ed
into factions. The Generals Bodenbrock and Lewen|haupt
were beheaded, having been &s;acrificed as &s;cape-goats
for the mini&s;try. Some un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts by &s;ea and
land were made again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians. At la&s;t the peace
of Abo was concluded; and the Duke of Hol&s;tein-Ut in,
uncle to the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the Ru&s;&s;ian throne, was cho&s;en as
next heir to the crown of Sweden. A party had been
formed in favour of the Prince of Denmark; and the order
of the pea&s;ants actually elected him as &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The de|bates
in the college of nobles ro&s;e to a very dangerous degree
of animo&s;ity, and were appea&s;ed by an harangue in Swe|di&s;h
ver&s;e, which one of the &s;enators pronounced. The
pea&s;ants yielded the point, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was &s;ettled on
the Duke of Hol&s;tein. Denmark, in&s;tigated by French
coucils, began to make preparations of war again&s;t Swe|den:
but, a body of Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries arriving in that
kingdom, under the command of General Keith, and the
Czarina declaring &s;he would a&s;&s;i&s;t the Swedes with her
whole force, the King of Denmark thought proper to
di&s;arm. It had been an old maxim of French policy to
embroil the courts of the North, that they might be to$
much employed at home to intermeddle in the affairs o$
<PB N="103" REF="109">
Germany, while France was at war with the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria. The good under&s;tanding between the Czarina
and the Queen of Hungary was at this period de&s;troyed,
in con&s;equence of a con&s;piracy which had been formed by
&s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tinction at the court of Peter&s;burgh, for
removing the Empre&s;s Eli&s;abeth, and recalling the
Prince&s;s Anne to the admini&s;tration. This de&s;ign being
di&s;covered, the principal con&s;pirators were corporally pu|ni&s;hed,
and &s;ent in exile to Siberia. The Marquis de
Botta, the Au&s;trian mini&s;ter, who had re&s;ided at the court
of the Czarina, was &s;u&s;pected of having been concerned
in the plot; though the grounds of this &s;u&s;picion did not
appear until after he was recalled and &s;ent as amba&s;&s;ador to
the court of Berlin. The Empre&s;s demanded &s;atisfaction
of the Queen of Hungary, who appointed commi&s;&s;ioners
to enquire into his conduct, and he was acquitted: but
the Czarina was not at all &s;atisfied of his innocence. In
February a defen&s;ive treaty of alliance was concluded be|tween
this prince&s;s and the King of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. By this time France was deprived of her
able&s;t mini&s;ter, in the death of the Cardinal de Fleury,
who had for many years managed the affairs of that king|dom.
He is &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a lively genius, and an
in&s;inuating addre&s;s; to have been regular in his deport|ment,
and moderate in his di&s;po&s;ition; but at the &s;ame
time he has been branded as deceitful, di&s;&s;embling,
and vindictive. His &s;cheme of politicks was altogether
pacifick: he endeavoured to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;es by
rai&s;ing and fomenting intrigues at foreign courts: he did
not &s;eem to pay much regard to the military glory of
France; and he too much neglected the naval power of
that kingdom. Since Broglio was driven out of Germany,
the French court affected uncommon moderation. They
pretended that their troops had only acted as auxiliaries
while they remained in the empire: being, however, appre|hen&s;ive
of an irruption into their own dominions, they
declared, that tho&s;e troops were no longer to be con&s;idered
in that light, but as &s;ubjects acting in the &s;ervice of France.
<PB N="104" REF="110">
The campaign in Italy proved unfavourable to the Spa|niards.
In the beginning of February Count Gages, who
commanded the Spani&s;h army in the Bologne&s;e, amount|ing
to four-and-twenty thou&s;and men, pa&s;&s;ed the
Panaro, and advanced to Campo-Santo, where he
encountered the Imperial and Piedmonte&s;e forces, com|manded
by the Counts Traun and A&s;premont. The
&s;trength of the two armies was nearly equal. The action
was ob&s;tinate and bloody, though indeci&s;ive. The Spa|niards
lo&s;t about four thou&s;and men, killed, wounded, or
taken. The damage &s;u&s;tained by the confederates was
not quite &s;o great. Some cannon and colours were taken
on both &s;ides; and each claimed the victory. Count Gages
repa&s;&s;ed the Panaro; retreated &s;uddenly from Bologna;
and marched to Rimini in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, where
he fortified his camp in an advantageous &s;ituation, after
having &s;uffered &s;everely by de&s;ertion. Count Traun re|mained
inactive in the Modene&s;e till September, when he
re&s;igned his command to Prince Lobkowitz. This gene|ral
entered the Bologne&s;e in October, and then advanced
towards Count Gages, who, with his forces, now reduced
to &s;even thou&s;and, retreated to Fano; but afterwards took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Pe&s;aro, and fortified all the pa&s;&s;es of the river
Foglia. The &s;ea&s;on was far advanced before the Spani&s;h
troops, commanded by Don Philip, in Savoy, entered upon
action. In all probability, the courts of Ver&s;ailles and
Madrid carried on &s;ome private negociation with the King
of Sardinia. This expedient failing, Don Philip decamped
from Chamberri in the latter end of Augu&s;t, and defiling
through Dauphine towards Briancon, was joined by the
Prince of Conti, at the head of twenty thou&s;and French
auxiliaries. Thus re-enforced, he attacked the Piedmon|te&s;e
lines at Chateau-Dauphine; but was repul&s;ed in &s;everal
attempts, and obliged to retreat with con&s;iderable lo&s;s.
The French e&s;tabli&s;hed their winter-quarters in Dauphine
and Provence; and the Spaniards maintained their foot|ing
in Savoy.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="111">
&sect; XLV. The Briti&s;h fleet commanded by Admiral
Matthews over-awed all the &s;tates that bordered on the
Mediterranean. This officer, about the end of June,
under&s;tanding that fourteen xebecks, laden with artillery
and ammunition for the Spani&s;h army, had arrived at
Genoa, &s;ailed thither from the road of Hieres, and de|manded
of the republick that they would either oblige
the&s;e ve&s;&s;els with the &s;tores to quit their harbour, or &s;e|que&s;ter
their lading until a general peace &s;hould be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.
After &s;ome di&s;pute, it was agreed that the cannon
and &s;tores &s;hould be depo&s;ited in the ca&s;tle of Bonifacio,
&s;ituated on a rock at the &s;outh end of Cor&s;ica; and that
the xebecks &s;hould have leave to retire without mole&s;tation.
The Cor&s;icans had &s;ome years before revolted, and &s;haken
off the dominion of the Genoe&s;e, under which their i&s;land
had remained for many centuries. They found them&s;elves
oppre&s;&s;ed, and re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ert their freedom. They con|ferred
the &s;overeign authority on a German adventurer,
who was &s;olemnly proclaimed, by the name of King
Theodore. He had &s;upplied them with &s;ome arms and
ammunition, which he had brought from Tunis; and
amu&s;ed them with promi&s;es of being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by foreign
powers in retrieving their independency: but as the&s;e pro|mi&s;es
were not performed, they treated him &s;o roughly,
that he had thought proper to quit the i&s;land, and they
&s;ubmitted again to their old ma&s;ters. The troubles of
Cor&s;ica were now revived. Theodore revi&s;ited his king|dom,
and was recognized by the principal chiefs of the
i&s;land. He publi&s;hed a manife&s;to: he granted a general
pardon to all his &s;ubjects who &s;hould return to their obedi|ence:
he pretended to be countenanced and &s;upported
by the King of Great-Britain and the Queen of Hungary.
He was certainly thought a proper in&s;trument to perplex
and harra&s;s the Genoe&s;e, and &s;upplied at this juncture with
a &s;um of money to purcha&s;e arms for the Cor&s;icans: but
a change &s;oon happened in the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, and then
he was &s;uffered to relap&s;e into his original ob&s;curity. Ad|miral
Matthews, though he did not undertake any expe|dition
<PB N="106" REF="112">
of importance again&s;t the maritime towns of Spain,
continued to a&s;&s;ert the Briti&s;h empire at &s;ea through the
whole extent of the Mediterranean. The Spani&s;h army
under Don Philip was no &s;ooner in motion, than the
Engli&s;h admiral ordered &s;ome troops and cannon to be
di&s;embarked for the &s;ecurity of Villa-Franca. Some &s;tores
having been landed at Civita-Vecchia, for the u&s;e of the
Spani&s;h forces under Count Gages, Matthews interpreted
this tran&s;action into a violation of the neutrality which the
Pope had profe&s;&s;ed; and &s;ent thither a &s;quadron to bom|bard
the place. The city of Rome was filled with con|&s;ternation;
and the Pope had recour&s;e to the good
offices of his Sardinian Maje&s;ty, in con&s;equence of which
the Engli&s;h &s;quadron was ordered to withdraw. The
captains of &s;ingle crui&s;ing &s;hips, by their activity and vigi|lance,
wholly interrupted the commerce of Spain; canno|naded
and burned &s;ome towns on the &s;ea-&s;ide; and kept
the whole coa&s;t in continual alarm<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In May a dreadful plague broke out at Me&s;&s;ina in Sicily. It was im|ported in cotton and other commodities brought from the Morea; an$ &s;wept off &s;uch a multitude of people, that the city was almo&s;t depopulated all the galley-&s;laves, who were employed in burying the dead, peri&s;hed b$ the contagion; and this was the fate of many prie&s;ts and monks, who ad|mini&s;tered to tho&s;e who were infected. The dead bodies lay in heaps in the &s;treets, corrupting the air, and adding fre&s;h fuel to the rage of the pe&s;tilenc$ Numbers died mi&s;erably, for want of proper attendance and nece&s;&s;aries and all was horrour and de&s;olation. At the beginning of winter it cea&s;e$ after having de&s;troyed near fifty thou&s;and inhabitants of Me&s;&s;ina, and of t$$ garri&s;ons in the citadel and ca&s;tle. It was prevented from &s;preading in S$|cily by a &s;trong barricado drawn from Melazzo to Taormina; but it $word$ conveyed to Reggio in Calabria, by the avarice of a broker of that place$$ who bought &s;ome goods at Me&s;&s;ina. The King of Naples immediate$ ordered lines to be formed, together with a chain of troops, which cut o$ all communication between that place and the re&s;t of the continent.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVI. In the We&s;t-Indies &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts
were made by an Engli&s;h &s;quadron, commanded by Com|modore
Knowles. He attacked La Gueira on the coa&s;t o$
Carraccas, in the month of February; but met with &s;u$$
a warm reception, that he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t, and make
the be&s;t of his way for the Dutch i&s;land Cura&ccedil;oa, where
he repaired the damage he had &s;u&s;tained. His &s;hips being
refitted, he made another attempt upon Porto-Cavallo it
<PB N="107" REF="113">
$pril, which like the former mi&s;carried. Twelve hundred
$arines being landed in the neighbourhood of the place,
$ere &s;ei&s;ed with &s;uch a panick, that it was found nece&s;&s;ary to
$embark them without delay. Then the commodore aban|$$ned
the enterpri&s;e, and &s;ailed back to his &s;tation at the
$eward-I&s;lands, without having added much to his re|putation,
either as to conduct or re&s;olution. On the con|$$nent
of America the operations of the war were very in|con&s;iderable.
General Oglethorpe having received intelli|gence,
that the Spaniards prepared for another inva&s;ion
from St. Augu&s;tine, a&s;&s;embled a body of Indians, as a re|enforcement
to part of his own regiment, with the High|$anders
and rangers, and in the &s;pring began his march,
in order to anticipate the enemy. He encamped for &s;ome
time in the neighbourhood of St. Augu&s;tine, by way of
defiance: but they did not think proper to hazard an en|gagement;
and as he was in no condition to undertake a
&s;iege, he returned to Georgia. In October the Prince&s;s
Loui&s;a, younge&s;t daughter of his Britannick-Maje&s;ty, was
married by proxy, at Hanover, to the Prince-Royal of
Denmark, who met her at Altena, and conducted her to
Copenhagen.</P>

<P>&sect; I. THE di&s;contents of England were artfully in|flamed
by antimini&s;terial writers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1743.</NOTE> who not only
exaggerated the burthens of the people, and drew frightful
pictures of the di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery which, they &s;aid, impend|ed
over the nation, but al&s;o employed the arts of calumny
and mi&s;repre&s;entation, to excite a jealou&s;y and national
quarrel between the Engli&s;h and Hanoverians. They af|firmed,
that in the la&s;t campaign the Briti&s;h general had
been neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed; while the councils of foreign
officers, greatly inferior to him in capacity, quality, and
reputation, had been followed, to the prejudice of the com|mon
cau&s;e: that the Briti&s;h troops &s;u&s;tained daily in|&s;ults
from their own mercenaries, who were indulged
with particular marks of royal favour: that the &s;o|vereign
him&s;elf appeared at Dettingen in a Hanoverian
&s;carf; and that his electoral troops were of very little &s;ervice
in that engagement. Though the mo&s;t material of the&s;e
a&s;&s;ertions were certainly fal&s;e, they made a &s;trong impre&s;|&s;ion
on the minds of the people, already irritated by the
enormous expen&s;e of a continental war maintained for the
intere&s;t of Germany. When the parliament met in the
beginning of December, a motion was made in the Hou&s;e
of Peers, by the Earl of Sandwich, for an addre&s;s, be&s;eech|ing
his Maje&s;ty to di&s;continue the Hanoverian troops in
Briti&s;h pay, in order to remove the popular di&s;content, and
&s;top the murmurs of the Engli&s;h troops abroad. He was
&s;upported by the Duke of Bedford, the Earl of Che&s;ter|field,
and all the leaders in the oppo&s;ition, who did not
fail to enumerate, and in&s;i&s;t upon all the circum&s;tances we
have mentioned. They moreover ob&s;erved, that better
troops might be hired at a &s;maller expen&s;e: that it would
be a vain and endle&s;s ta&s;k to exhau&s;t the national trea&s;ure,
in enriching a hungry and barren electorate: that the po|pular
di&s;&s;atisfaction again&s;t the&s;e mercenaries was &s;o general,
<PB N="110" REF="116">
and rai&s;ed to &s;uch violence, as nothing but their di&s;mi&s;&s;io$
could appea&s;e: that if &s;uch hirelings &s;hould be thus con|tinued
from year to year, they might at la&s;t become a bur|then
entailed upon the nation, and be made &s;ub&s;ervient
under &s;ome ambitious prince, to purpo&s;es de&s;tructive $word$
Briti&s;h liberty. The&s;e were the &s;ugge&s;tions of &s;pleen an$
animo&s;ity: for, granting the nece&s;&s;ity of a land-war, th$
Hanoverians were the mo&s;t natural allies and auxiliarie$
which Great-Britain could engage and employ. How in|&s;olent
&s;oever &s;ome few individual generals of that electorat$
might have been in their private deportment, certain it is
their troops behaved with great &s;obriety, di&s;cipline, an$
decorum; and in the day of battle did their duty with a$
much courage and alacrity as any body of men ever di&s;play|ed
on the like occa&s;ion. The motion was rejected by th$
majority; but, when the term for keeping them in the
Briti&s;h pay was nearly expired, and the e&s;timates for their
being continued the en&s;uing year were laid before the
Hou&s;e, the Earl of Sandwich renewed his motion. The
Lord-Chancellor, as &s;peaker of the Hou&s;e, interpo&s;ing, de|clared,
that by their rules a que&s;tion once rejected could
not be revived during the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion. A debate en&s;ued,
and the &s;econd motion was over-ruled. The Hanoverian
troops were voted in the Hou&s;e of Commons: neverthele&s;s,
the &s;ame nobleman moved in the Upper Hou&s;e, that the
continuing &s;ixteen thou&s;and Honoverians in Briti&s;h pay
was prejudicial to his Maje&s;ty's true intere&s;t, u&s;ele&s;s to the
common cau&s;e, and dangerous to the welfare and tranquil|lity
of the nation. He was &s;econded by the Duke of
Marlborough, who had re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion in di&s;gu&s;t;
and the propo&s;al gave birth to another warm di&s;pute; but
victory declared, as u&s;ual, for the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>&sect; II. In the Hou&s;e of Commons they &s;u&s;tained divers
attacks. A motion was made for laying a duty of eight
&s;hillings in the pound on all places and pen&s;ions. Mr.
Grenville moved for an addre&s;s, to be&s;eech his Maje&s;ty,
that he would not engage the Briti&s;h nation any further
in the war on the continent, without the concurrence of
<PB N="111" REF="117">
the States-General on certain &s;tipulated proportions of
force and expen&s;e, as in the late war. The&s;e propo&s;als
$egat vigorous debates, in which the country-party were
always foiled by dint of &s;uperior number. Such was the
credit and influence of the mini&s;try in parliament, that
although the national debt was increa&s;ed by above &s;ix mil|lions
&s;ince the commencement of the war, the Commons
indulged them with an enormous &s;um for the expen&s;e of
the en&s;uing year. The grants &s;pecified in the votes
amounted to &s;ix millions and an half; to this &s;um were
added three millions and an half paid to the &s;inking-fund
in perpetual taxes; &s;o that this year's expen&s;e ro&s;e to ten
millions. The funds e&s;tabli&s;hed for the annual charge
were the land and malt-taxes, one million paid by the
Ea&s;t-India company for the renewal of their charter,
twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds by annuities, one million
from the &s;inking fund, &s;ix-and-thirty thou&s;and pounds
from the coinage, and &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds by a
$ottery: an expedient which for &s;ome time had been an|nually
repeated: and which, in a great mea&s;ure, contri|buted
to debauch the morals of the publick, by introdu|cing
a &s;pirit of gaming, de&s;tructive of all indu&s;try and
$irtue.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The di&s;&s;entions of the Briti&s;h parliament were
&s;uddenly &s;u&s;pended by an event that &s;eemed to unite both
parties in the pro&s;ecution of the &s;ame mea&s;ures. This
$as the intelligence of an intended inva&s;ion. By the par|liamentary
di&s;putes, the loud clamours, and the general
$i&s;&s;atisfaction of the people in Great-Britain, the French
$ini&s;try were per&s;uaded that the nation was ripe for a
$$volt. This belief was corroborated by the a&s;&s;ertions of
$$eir emi&s;&s;aries in different parts of Great-Britain and
$$eland. The&s;e were papi&s;ts and Jacobites of &s;trong pre|$dices
and warm imaginations, who &s;aw things through
$$e medium of pa&s;&s;ion and party, and &s;poke rather from
extravagant zeal than from &s;ober conviction. They gave
$$e court of Ver&s;ailles to under&s;tand, that if the Cheva|$$r
de St. George, or his elde&s;t &s;on, Charles-Edward,
<PB N="112" REF="118">
&s;hould appear at the head of a French army in Great-Britain,
a revolution would in&s;tantly follow in his favo$$&punc;.
This intimation was agreeable to Cardinal de Tenci$$
who, &s;ince the death of Fleury, had bor'n a &s;hare in $word$
admini&s;tration of France. He was of a violent enterpri|&s;ing
temper. He had been recommended to the purp$$
by the Chevalier de St. George, and was &s;eemingly at|tached
to the Stuart family. His ambition was flattere$$
with a pro&s;pect of giving a king to Great-Britain; $word$
performing &s;uch eminent &s;ervices to his benefactor; and $word$
re&s;toring to the throne of their ance&s;tors a family connect|ed
by the ties of blood with all the greate&s;t princes $word$
Europe. The mini&s;try of France fore&s;aw, that if even th$
aim &s;hould mi&s;carry, a de&s;cent upon Great-Britain wou$$
make a con&s;iderable diver&s;ion from the continent in favo$$
of France, and embroil and embarra&s;s his Britannick Ma|je&s;ty,
who was the chief &s;upport of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, $word$
all its allies. Actuated by the&s;e motives, he concerted mea|&s;ures
with the Chevalier de St. George at Rome, who be|ing
too much advanced in years to engage per&s;ona$$
in &s;uch an expedition, agreed to delegate his preten|&s;ions
and authority to his &s;on Charles, a youth of prom$|&s;ing
talents, &s;age, &s;ecret, brave, and enterpri&s;ing, amiable
in his per&s;on, grave, and even re&s;erved in his deportment.
He approved him&s;elf in the &s;equel compo&s;ed and mode|rate
in &s;ucce&s;s, wonderfully firm in adver&s;ity; and thoug$
tenderly nur&s;ed in all the delights of an effeminate coun|try,
and gentle climate, patient almo&s;t beyond belief $word$
cold, hunger, and fatigue. Such was the adventur$$
now de&s;tined to fill the hope which the French mini&s;t$$
had conceived from the projected inva&s;ion of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. Count Saxe was appointed by the French Ki$$
commander of the troops de&s;igned for this expedition$
which amounted to fifteen thou&s;and men. They bega$
their march to Picardy, and a great number of ve&s;&s;e$
was a&s;&s;embled for their embarkation at Dunkirk, Cala$$
and Boulogn. It was determined that they &s;hould be
<PB N="113" REF="119">
$anded in Kent, under convoy of a &s;trong &s;quadron
$quipped at Bre&s;t, and commanded by Mon&s;ieur de Roque|$euille,
an officer of experience and capacity. The Che|valier
de St. George is &s;aid to have required the per&s;onal
&s;ervice of the Duke of Ormond, who excu&s;ed him|&s;elf
on account of his advanced age: be that as it will,
Prince Charles departed from Rome about the end of
December, in the di&s;gui&s;e of a Spani&s;h courier, attended
by one &s;ervant only, and furni&s;hed with pa&s;&s;ports by
Cardinal Aquaviva. He travelled through Tu&s;cany to
Genoa, from whence he proceded to Savona, where he
embarked for Antibes, and pro&s;ecuting his journey to
Paris, was indulged with a private audience of the French
King; then he &s;et out incognito for the coa&s;t of Picardy.
The Briti&s;h mini&s;try being appri&s;ed of his arrival in
France, at once comprehended the de&s;tination of the ar|maments
prepared at Bre&s;t and Boulogn. Mr. Thomp|&s;on,
the Engli&s;h re&s;ident at Paris, received orders to make
a remon&s;trance to the French mini&s;try, on the violation
of tho&s;e treaties by which the pretender to the crown of
Great-Britain was excluded from the territories of France.
But he was given to under&s;tand, that his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
Maje&s;ty would not explain him&s;elf on that &s;ubject, until
the King of England &s;hould have given &s;atisfaction on
the repeated complaints which had been made to him,
touching the infractions of tho&s;e very treaties which had
been &s;o often violated by his orders. In the month of
January, M. de Roquefeuille &s;ailed from Bre&s;t, directing
his cour&s;e up the Engli&s;h channel, with twenty &s;hips of
war. They were immediately di&s;covered by an Engli&s;h
crui&s;er, which ran into Plymouth; and the intelligence
was conveyed by land to the board of Admiralty. Sir
John Norris was forthwith ordered to take the command
of the &s;quadron at Spithead, with which he &s;ailed round
to the Downs, where he was joined by &s;ome &s;hips of the
line from Chatham, and then he &s;ound him&s;elf at the
head of a &s;quadron con&s;iderably &s;tronger than that of the
enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="120">
&sect; V. Several regiments marched to the southern coa&s;t
of England: all governors and commanders were ordered
to repair immediately to their re&s;pective po&s;ts: the forts
at the mouths of the Thames and the Medway were put
in a po&s;ture of defence; and directions were i&s;&s;ued to
a&s;&s;emble the Kenti&s;h militia, to defend the coa&s;t in ca&s;e of
an inva&s;ion. On the fifteenth day of February, the King
&s;ent a me&s;&s;age to both Hou&s;es of parliament, intimating
the arrival of the Pretender's &s;on in France, the prepara|tions
at Dunkirk, and the appearance of a French fleet in
the Engli&s;h channel. They joined in an addre&s;s, de|claring
their indignation and abhorrence of the de&s;ign
formed in favour of a popi&s;h pretender; and a&s;&s;uring his
Maje&s;ty, that they would, with the warme&s;t zeal and
unanimity, take &s;uch mea&s;ures as would enable him to
fru&s;trate and defeat &s;o de&s;perate and in&s;olent an attempt.
Addre&s;&s;es of the &s;ame kind were pre&s;ented by the city of
London, both univer&s;ities, the principal towns of Great-Britain,
the clergy, the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters, the qua|kers,
and almo&s;t all the corporations and communities of
the kingdom. A requi&s;ition was made of the &s;ix thou&s;and
auxiliaries which the States-General were by treaty
obliged to furni&s;h on &s;uch occa&s;ions; and the&s;e were
granted with great alacrity and expedition. The Earl of
Stair, forgetting his wrongs, took this opportunity of of|fering
his &s;ervices to government, and was re-inve&s;ted
with the chief command of the forces in Great-Britain.
His example was followed by &s;everal noblemen of the fir&s;t
rank. The Duke of Montague was permitted to rai&s;e a
regiment of hor&s;e; and orders were &s;ent to bring over &s;ix
thou&s;and of the Briti&s;h troops from Flanders, in ca&s;e the
inva&s;ion &s;hould actually take place. His Maje&s;ty was, in
another addre&s;s from parliament, exhorted to augment
his forces by &s;ea and land: the Habeas Corpus act was
&s;u&s;pended for &s;ix months, and &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction
were apprehended on &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;onable practi&s;es:
a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued for putting the laws in exe$u|tion
again&s;t papi&s;ts and nonjorors, who were commanded
<PB N="115" REF="121">
to retire ten miles from London; and every precaution
was taken which &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of
the publick tranquillity.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. Mean while the French court proceeded with
their preparations at Boulogn and Dunkirk, under the
eye of the young Pretender; and &s;even thou&s;and men were
actually embarked. M. de Roquefeuille &s;ailed up the
channel as far as Dungene&s;s, a promontory on the coa&s;t of
Kent, after having detached M. de Barreil, with five &s;hips,
to ha&s;ten the embarkation at Dunkirk. While the French
admiral anchored off Dungene&s;s, he perceived, on the
twenty-fourth day of February, the Briti&s;h fleet, under Sir
John Norris, doubling the South-Foreland from the
Downs; and though the wind was again&s;t him, taking
the opportunity of the tide to come up and engage the
French &s;quadron. Roquefeuille, who little expected &s;uch
a vi&s;it, could not be altogether compo&s;ed, con&s;idering the
great &s;uperiority of his enemies: but the tide failing, the
Engli&s;h admiral was obliged to anchor two leagues &s;hort
of the enemy. In this interval, M. Roquefeuille called a
council of war, in which it was determined to avoid an
engagement, weigh anchor at &s;un&s;et, and make the be&s;t of
their way to the place from whence they had &s;et &s;ail. This
re&s;olution was favoured by a very hard gale of wind, which
began to blow from the north-ea&s;t, and carried them down
the channel with incredible expedition. But the &s;ame
&s;torm which, in all probability, &s;aved their fleet from de|&s;truction,
utterly di&s;concerted the de&s;ign of invading
England. A great number of their tran&s;ports was driven
a&s;hore and de&s;troyed, and the re&s;t were &s;o damaged that
they could not be &s;peedily repaired. The Engli&s;h were
now ma&s;ters at &s;ea, and their coa&s;t was &s;o well guarded,
that the enterpri&s;e could not be pro&s;ecuted with any pro|bability
of &s;ucce&s;s. The French generals nominated to
&s;erve in this expedition returned to Paris, and the young
Pretender re&s;olved to wait a more favourable opportunity.
In the mean time he remained in Paris, or that neigh|bourhood,
incognito, and almo&s;t totally neglected by the
<PB N="116" REF="122">
court of France. Finding him&s;elf in this di&s;agreeable
&s;ituation, and being vi&s;ited by John Murray of Brough|ton,
who magnified the power of his friends in Great-Britain,
he re&s;olved to make &s;ome bold effort, even without
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Louis, in who&s;e &s;incerity he had no faith,
and forthwith took proper mea&s;ures to obtain exact infor|mation
touching the number, inclinations, and influence
of his father's adherents in England and Scotland.
The French King no longer pre&s;erved any mea&s;ures with
the court of London: the Briti&s;h re&s;ident at Paris was
given to under&s;tand, that a declaration of war mu&s;t en&s;ue;
and this was actually publi&s;hed on the twentieth day of
March. The King of Great-Britain was taxed with hav|ing
di&s;&s;uaded the court of Vienna from entertaining any
thoughts of an accommodation: with having infringed
the convention of Hanover; with having exerci&s;ed piracy
upon the &s;ubjects of France, and with having blocked up
the harbour of Toulon. On the thirty-fir&s;t day of
March, a like denunciation of war again&s;t France
was publi&s;hed at London, amid&s;t the acclamation$
of the people.</P>
<P>&sect; VII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1744.</NOTE> The Commons of England, in order to evince
their loyalty, brought in a bill, denouncing the penalties
of high trea&s;on again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould maintain corre|&s;pondence
with the &s;ons of the Pretender. In the Upper
Hou&s;e, Lord Hardwicke, the Chancellor, moved, that a
clau&s;e &s;hould be in&s;erted, extending the crime of trea&s;on
to the po&s;terity of the offenders, during the lives of the
Pretender's &s;ons. The motion, which was &s;upported by
the whole &s;trength of the mini&s;try, produced a warm debate
in which the Duke of Bedford, the Earl of Che&s;terfield,
the Lords Talbot and Hervey, argued again&s;t it in the mo&s;t
pathetick manner, as an illiberal expedient, contrary to
the dictates of humanity, the law of nature, the rules of
common ju&s;tice, and the precepts of religion; and expedient
that would involve the innocent with the guilty, and tend
to the augmentation of mini&s;terial power, for which pur|po&s;e
it was undoubtedly calculated. Notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="117" REF="123">
the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1744.</NOTE> the clau&s;e was carried in the affirmative,
and the bill &s;ent back to the Commons, where the amend|ment
was vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Lord Strange, Lord
Guern&s;ey, Mr. W. Pitt, and other members, by whom
the original bill had been countenanced<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The oppo&s;ition had &s;u&s;tained a heavy blow in the death of the Duke of Argyle, a nobleman of &s;hining qualifications for the &s;enate and the field, who&s;e character would have been &s;till more illu&s;trious had not &s;ome parts of his conduct &s;ubjected him to the &s;u&s;picion of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and incon&s;tancy. He was &s;ucceeded in that title by his brother, Archibald Earl of Ilay.</NOTE>: the majority,
however, declared for the amendment, and the bill ob|tained
the royal a&s;&s;ent. The &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was
clo&s;ed in May, when the King told them that the French
had made va&s;t preparations on the &s;ide of the Nether|lands;
and that the States-General had agreed to furni&s;h
the &s;uccours &s;tipulated by treaties.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. By this time an action had happened in the
Mediterranean between the Briti&s;h fleet commanded by
Admiral Matthews, and the combined &s;quadrons of France
and Spain, which had been for &s;ome time blocked up in
the harbour of Toulon. On the ninth day of February
they were perceived &s;tanding out of the road, to the
number of four-and-thirty &s;ail: the Engli&s;h admiral im|mediately
weighed from Hieres-bay; and on the eleventh,
part of the fleets engaged. Matthews attacked the Spani&s;h
admiral, Don Navarro, who&s;e &s;hip, the Real, was a fir&s;t
rate, mounted with above an hundred guns. Rear-Ad|miral
Rowley &s;ingled out M. de Court, who commanded
the French &s;quadron; and a very few captains followed
the example of their commanders: but Vice-Admiral Le&s;|$ock,
with his whole divi&s;ion, remained at a great di&s;tance
a&s;tern; and &s;everal captains who were immediately under
the eye of Matthews behaved in &s;uch a manner as reflected
di&s;grace upon their country. The whole tran&s;action was
conducted without order or deliberation. The French
and Spaniards would have willingly avoided an engage|ment,
as the Briti&s;h &s;quadron was &s;uperior to them in
&s;trength and number. M. de Court, therefore, made
the be&s;t of his way towards the Straits mouth, probably
<PB N="118" REF="124">
with intention to join the Bre&s;t &s;quadron:<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1744.</NOTE> but he had
orders to protect the Spani&s;h fleet; and as they &s;ailed
heavily, he was obliged to wait for them, at the hazard
of maintaining a battle with the Engli&s;h. Thus circum|&s;tanced
he made &s;ail and lay to by turns; &s;o that the
Briti&s;h admiral could not engage them in proper order;
and as they out&s;ailed his &s;hips, he began to fear they would
e&s;cape him altogether, &s;hould he wait for Vice-Admiral
Le&s;tock, who was &s;o far a&s;tern. Under this apprehen&s;ion
he made the &s;ignal for engaging, while that for the line of
battle was &s;till di&s;played; and this incon&s;i&s;tency naturally
introduced confu&s;ion. The fight was maintained with
great vivacity by the few who engaged. The Real being
quite di&s;abled, and lying like a wreck upon the water, Mr.
Matthews &s;ent a fire&s;hip to de&s;troy her; but the expedient
did not take effect. The &s;hip ordered to cover this ma|chine
did not obey the &s;ignal; &s;o that the captain of the
fire&s;hip was expo&s;ed to the whole fire of the enemy. Never|thele&s;s,
he continued to advance until he found the ve&s;&s;el
&s;inking; and being within a few yards of the Real, he &s;et
fire to the fu&s;ees. The &s;hip was immediately in &s;lames, in
the mid&s;t of which he and his lieutenant, with twelve men,
peri&s;hed,. This was likewi&s;e the fate of a Spani&s;h
launch, which had been mann$d with fifty &s;ailors, to pre|vent
the fire&s;hip from running on board the Real. One
&s;hip of the line belonging to the Spani&s;h &s;quadron &s;truck
to Captain Hawke, who &s;ent a lieutenant to take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of her: &s;he was afterwards retaken by the French
&s;quadron; but was found &s;o di&s;abled, that they left her de|&s;erted,
and &s;he was next day burned by order of Admiral
Matthews. At night the action cea&s;ed; and the Admiral
found his own &s;hip &s;o much damaged, that he moved $word$
flag into another. Captain Cornwall fell in the engage|ment,
after having exhibited a remarkable proof of courage
and intrepidity: but the lo&s;s of men was very incon&s;ider|able.
Next day the enemy appeared to leeward, and the
admiral gave chace till night, when he brought to, that $e
<PB N="119" REF="125">
might be joined by the &s;hips a-&s;tern. They were perceiv|ed
again on the thirteenth at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and
pur&s;ued till the evening. In the morning of the fourteenth,
twenty &s;ail of them were &s;een di&s;tinctly, and Le&s;tock with
his divi&s;ion had gained ground of them con&s;iderably by
noon; but Admiral Matthews, di&s;played the &s;ignal for
leaving off cha&s;e, and bore away for Port-Mahon, to re|pair
the damage he had &s;u&s;tained. Mean while the com|bined
&s;quadrons continued their cour&s;e towards the coa&s;t
of Spain. M. de Court, with his divi&s;ion, anchored in
the road of Alicant; and Don Navarro &s;ailed into the har|bour
of Carthagena. Admiral Matthews on his arrival
at Minorca, accu&s;ed Le&s;tock of having mi&s;behaved on the
day of action; &s;u&s;pended him from his office, and &s;ent him
pri&s;oner to England, where, in his turn, he accu&s;ed his
accu&s;er. Long before the engagement, the&s;e two officers
had expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t virulent re&s;entment again&s;t each
other. Matthews was brave, open, and undi&s;gui&s;ed; but
proud, imperious, and precipitate. Le&s;tock had &s;ignaliz|ed
his courage on many occa&s;ions, and perfectly under|&s;tood
the whole di&s;cipline of the navy; but he was cool,
cunning, and vindictive. He had been treated &s;uperci|liou&s;ly
by Matthews, and in revenge took advantage of his
errors and precipitation. To gratify this pa&s;&s;ion, he be|trayed
the intere&s;t and glory of his country; for it is not
to be doubted, but that he might have come up in time to
engage; and, in that ca&s;e, the fleets of France and Spain
would in all likelihood have been de&s;troyed: but he en|treched
him&s;elf within the punctilios of di&s;cipline, and
&s;aw with plea&s;ure his antagoni&s;t expo&s;e him&s;elf to the
hazard of death, ruin, and di&s;grace. Matthews him&s;elf,
in the &s;equel, &s;acrificed his duty to his re&s;entment, in re|&s;training
Le&s;tock from pur&s;uing and attacking the com|bined
&s;quadrons on the third day after the engagement,
when they appeared di&s;abled, and in manife&s;t di&s;order, and
would have fallen an ea&s;y prey, had they been vigorou&s;ly
attacked. One can hardly, without indignation, reflect
<PB N="120" REF="126">
upon tho&s;e in&s;tances, in which a community has &s;o &s;everely
&s;uffered from the per&s;onal animo&s;ity of individuals. The
mi&s;carriage off Toulon became the &s;ubject of a parliamen|tary
enquiry in England. The Commons, in an addre&s;s
to the throne, de&s;ired that a court-martial might be appoint|ed
to try the delinquents. By this time Le&s;tock had ac|cu&s;ed
Matthews, and all the captains of his divi&s;ion who
mi&s;behaved on the day of battle. The court-martial was
con&s;tituted, and proceeded to tryal. Several commanders
of &s;hips were ca&s;hiered: Vice-Admiral Le&s;tock was hon|ourably
acquitted; and Admiral Matthews rendered inca|pable
of &s;erving for the future in his Maje&s;ty's navy. All
the world knew that Le&s;tock kept aloof, and that Mat|thews
ru&s;hed into the hotte&s;t part of the engagement. Yet
the former triumphed on his tryal, and the latter narrowly
e&s;caped the &s;entence of death for cowardice and mi&s;con|duct.
Such deci&s;ions are not to be accounted for, except
from prejudice and faction.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The war in Germany, which had been almo&s;t
extingui&s;hed in the la&s;t campaign, began to revive, and
raged with redoubled violence. The Emperor had &s;olicit|ed
the mediation of his Britannick Maje&s;ty for compro|mi&s;ing
the differences between him and the court of
Vienna. Prince William of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el had conferred
with the King of England on this &s;ubject; and a negocia|tion
was begun at Hanau. The Emperor offered to di&s;|mi&s;s
the French auxiliaries, provided the Au&s;trians would
evacuate his hereditary dominions. Nay, Prince William
and Lord Carteret, as plenipotentiaries, actually agreed to
preliminaries, by which his Imperial Maje&s;ty engaged to
renounce the alliance of France, and throw him&s;elf into the
arms of the maritime powers; to re&s;ign all preten&s;ions to
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and to revive the
vote of Bohemia in the electoral college, on condition of
his being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dominions;
recognized as Emperor by the Queen of Hungry, and
accommodated with a monthly &s;ub&s;idy for his mainte|nance,
<PB N="121" REF="127">
as his own territories were exhau&s;ted and impove|ri&s;hed
by the war. By a &s;eparate article, the King of
Great-Britain promi&s;ed to furni&s;h him with three hundred
thou&s;and crowns, and to interpo&s;e his good offices with the
Queen of Hungary, that his electoral dominions &s;hould be
favourably treated. The&s;e preliminaries, though &s;ettled,
were not &s;igned. The court of Vienna was unwilling to
part with their conque&s;ts in Bavaria and the Upper-Pala|tinate.
The queen tru&s;ted too much to the valour of her
troops, and the wealth of her allies, to li&s;ten to &s;uch terms
of accommodation; and whatever arguments were u&s;ed
with the King of Great-Britain, certain it is the negocia|tion
was dropped, on pretence that the articles were di&s;|approved
by the mini&s;try of England. The Emperor, en|vironed
with di&s;tre&s;s, renewed his application to the King
of Great-Britain; and even declared that he would refer his
cau&s;e to the determination of the maritime powers: but
all his advances were di&s;countenanced; and the treaty of
Worms di&s;pelled all hope of accommodation. In this
manner did the Briti&s;h mini&s;try reject the faire&s;t oppor|tunity
that could po&s;&s;ibly occur of terminating the war in
Germany with honour and advantage, and of freeing
their country from that in&s;ufferable burthen of expen&s;e
under which &s;he groaned.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The inflexibility of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and its
chief ally, proved &s;erviceable to the Emperor. The for|lorn
&s;ituation of this unfortunate prince excited the com|pa&s;&s;ion
of divers princes: they re&s;ented the in&s;olence with
which the head of the empire had been treated by the court
of Vienna; and they were alarmed at the increa&s;ing power
of a family noted for pride, tyranny, and ambition. The&s;e
con&s;iderations gave ri&s;e to the treaty of Franckfort, con|cluded
in May between the Emperor, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia,
$he King of Sweden as Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, and the
Elector-Palatine. They engaged to pre&s;erve the con&s;titu|tions
of the empire, according to the treaty of We&s;tphalia,
$nd to &s;upport the Emperor in his rank and dignity.
They agreed to employ their good offices with the Queen
<PB N="122" REF="128">
of Hungary, that &s;he might be induced to acknowledg$
the Emperor, to re&s;tore his hereditary dominions, an
give up the archives of the empire that were in her po&s;&s;e$&s;ion.
They guaranteed to each other their re&s;pective te$ritories:
the di&s;putes about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the late Em$peror
they referred to the deci&s;ion of the &s;tates of the em+pire:
they promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in ca&s;e of be in$$
attacked; and they invited the King of Poland, the Elec$tor
of Cologn, and the Bi&s;hop of Liege, to accede$
this treaty. Such was the confederacy that broke all th$
mea&s;ures which had been concerted between the King
of Great-Britain and her Hungarian Maje&s;ty for the ope$rations
of the campaign. In the mean time, the French
King declared war again&s;t this prince&s;s, on preten$$
that &s;he was ob&s;tinately deaf to all terms of accommoda$tion,
and determined to carry the war into the territorie$
of France. In her counter-declaration &s;he taxed Loui$
with having infringed the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagement with
re&s;pect to the pragmatick &s;anction; with having &s;pirited
up different pretenders to lay claim to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the
late Emperor; with having endevoured to in&s;tigate the
common enemy of Chri&s;tendom again&s;t her; and with
having acted the incendiary in the north of Europe, that
the Czarina might be prevented from a&s;&s;i&s;ting the hou&s;e
of Au&s;tria, while his numerous armies over&s;pread the
empire, and de&s;olated her hereditary countries. The&s;e
recriminations were literally true. The hou&s;es of Bour|bon
and Au&s;tria have, for many centuries, been the com|mon
di&s;turbers and plagues of Europe.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. The King of France, though in him&s;elf pacifick
and unenterpri&s;ing, was &s;timulated by his mini&s;try to
ta&s;te the glory and conque&s;t in the Netherlands, where he
had a&s;&s;embled an army of one hundred and twenty thou|&s;and
men, provided with a very formidable train of ar|tillery.
The chief command was ve&s;ted in the Mare&s;chal
Count de Saxe, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great military talents, and
proved to be one of the mo&s;t fortunate generals of the age in
which be lived. The allied forces, con&s;i&s;ting of Engli&s;h,
<PB N="123" REF="129">
Hanoverians, Dutch, and Au&s;trians, to the number of
&s;eventy thou&s;and effective men, were in the month of
May a&s;&s;embled in the neighbourhood of Bru&s;&s;els, from
whence they marched towards Oudenarde, and po&s;ted
them&s;elves behind the Schelde, being unable to retard the
progre&s;s of the enemy. The French Monarch, attended
by his favourite ladies, with all the pomp of ea&s;tern lux|ury,
arrived at Li&s;le on the twelfth day of the &s;ame
month; and in the adjacent plain reviewed his army.
The States-General, alarmed at his preparations, had, in
a conference with his amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, expre&s;&s;ed
their apprehen&s;ions, and entreated his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
Maje&s;ty would de&s;i&s;t from his de&s;ign of attacking their
barrier. Their remon&s;trances having proved ineffectual,
they now &s;ent a mini&s;ter to wait upon that monarch, to
enforce their former repre&s;entations, and repeat their entrea|ties:
but no regard was paid to his reque&s;t. The French
King told him, he was determined to pro&s;ecute the war
with vigour, as his moderation hitherto had &s;erved to no
other purpo&s;e but that of rendering his enemies more in|tractable.
Accordingly, his troops inve&s;ted Menin, which
was in &s;even days &s;urrendered upon capitulation. Ypres,
Fort Knocke, and Furnes underwent the &s;ame fate;
and on the twenty-ninth day of June the King of
France entered Dunkirk in triumph.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. He had taken &s;uch precautions for the defence
of Al&s;ace, which was guarded by con&s;iderable armies
under the command of Coigni and Seckendorf, that he
thought he had nothing to fear from the Au&s;trians in that
quarter: be&s;ides, he had received &s;ecret a&s;&s;urances that the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia would declare for the Emperor; &s;o
that he re&s;olved to pur&s;ue his conque&s;ts in the Nether|lands.
But all his mea&s;ures were defeated by the activity
of Prince Charles of Lorraine, and his officers, who found
means to pa&s;s the Rhine, and oblige the French and Ba|$arian
generals to retire to Lampertheim, that they
might cover Stra&s;burgh. The Au&s;trians made them&s;elves
ma&s;ters of Haguenau and Saverne: they &s;ecured the
<PB N="124" REF="130">
pa&s;&s;es of Lorraine; and laid all the country of Lowe$
Al&s;ace under contribution. The King of France was $word$
&s;ooner appri&s;ed of the prince's having pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine$
and penetrated into this province, than he &s;ent off a de|tachment
of thirty thou&s;and men from his army in Flan|ders
to re-enforce that under the Mare&s;chal de Coigny&punc;
and he him&s;elf began his journey from the Rhine, that he
might in per&s;on check the progre&s;s of the enemy: but
this de&s;ign was anticipated by a &s;evere di&s;temper that
overtook him at Metz in Lorraine. The phy&s;icians de|&s;paired
of his life. The Queen, with her children, and
all the princes of the blood, ha&s;tened from Ver&s;ailles to
pay their la&s;t duties to their dying &s;overeign, who, as $word$
true penitent, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his concubines, and began to pre|pare
him&s;elf for death: yet the &s;trength of his con&s;titu|tion
triumphed over the fever, and his recovery was cele|brated
all over his dominions with uncommon marks o$
joy and affection.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. In the mean time the &s;chemes of the Au|&s;trian
general were fru&s;trated by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia,
who, in the month of Augu&s;t, entered the electorate of
Saxony, at the head of a numerous army. There he de|clared,
in a publick manife&s;to, that his aims were only to
re-e&s;tabli&s;h the peace of the empire, and to &s;upport the
dignity of its head. He affured the inhabitants that they
might depend upon his protection, in ca&s;e they &s;hould
remain quiet; but threatened them with fire and &s;word
&s;hould they pre&s;ume to oppo&s;e his arms. In a re&s;cript
addre&s;&s;ed to his mini&s;ters at foreign courts, he accu&s;ed
the Queen of Hungary of ob&s;tinacy, in refu&s;ing to ac|knowledge
the Emperor, and re&s;tore his hereditary domi|nions:
he &s;aid he had engaged in the league of Franck|fort,
to hinder the head of the empire from being op|pre&s;&s;ed:
that he had no intention to violate the peace of
Bre&s;lau, or enter as a principal into this war: he a&s;&s;irmed,
that his de&s;ign was to act as auxiliary to the Emperor,
and e&s;tabli&s;h the quiet of Germany. He penetrated into Bo|hemia
and undertook the &s;iege of Prague, the governor of
<PB N="125" REF="131">
which &s;urrendered him&s;elf and his garri&s;on pri&s;oners of
war on the &s;ixteenth day of September. He afterwards
reduced Tabor, Bodweis, and Teyn, and in a word &s;ub|dued
the greate&s;t part of the kingdom; the Au&s;trian
forces in that country being in no condition to &s;top
his progre&s;s. Neverthele&s;s, he was &s;oon obliged to re|linqui&s;h
his conque&s;ts. Prince Charles of Lorraine was
recalled from Al&s;ace, and repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine in the face
of the French army, commanded by the Mare&s;chals de
Coigni, Noailles, and Bellei&s;le. Then he marched to
the Danube, laid the Upper Palatinate under contribu|tion,
and entering Bohemia, joined the troops under
Bathiani at Merotitz. The King of Poland Elector of
Saxony, at this juncture, declared in favour of her Hun|garian
Maje&s;ty. A convention for the mutual guarantee
of their dominions had been &s;igned between the&s;e two
powers in December; and now Prince Charles of Lor|taine
was re-enforced by twenty thou&s;and Saxon troops,
under the conduct of the Duke of Saxe-We&s;&s;enfels. The
combined army was &s;uperior to that of his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty,
whom they re&s;olved to engage. But he retired
before them, and having evacuated all the places he had
garri&s;oned in Bohemia, retreated with precipitation into
Sile&s;ia. There his troops were put into winter-quarters;
and he him&s;elf returned to Berlin, extremely mortified at
the i&s;&s;ue of the campaign.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Count Seckendorf
marched into Bavaria, at the head of a &s;trong army,
$rove the Au&s;trians out of that electorate, and the Em|peror
regained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Munich, his capital, on the
twenty-&s;econd day of October. In Augu&s;t the French
army pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at Fort-Louis, and inve&s;ted the
&s;trong and important city of Fribourg, de$ended by Ge|neral
Demnitz, at the head of nine thou&s;and veterans.
The King of France arrived in the camp on the eleventh
day of October; and the &s;iege was carried on with un|common
vigour. The Au&s;trian governour made incredible
efforts in the defence of the p$ace, which he maintained
<PB N="126" REF="132">
until it was reduced to a heap of ruins, and one half of
the garri&s;on de&s;troyed. At length, however, they were
obliged to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, after the
trenches had been opened five-and-forty days, during
which they had killed above fifteen thou&s;and of the be|&s;iegers.
With this conque&s;t, the French King clo&s;ed the
campaign, and his army was cantoned along the Rhine,
under the in&s;pection of the Count de Maillebois. By the
detachments drawn from the French army in Flanders,
Count Saxe had found him&s;elf con&s;iderably weaker than
the confederates: he threw up &s;trong entrenchments behind
the Lys, where he remained on the defen&s;ive, until he was
re-enforced by the Count de Clermont, who commanded
a &s;eparate body on the &s;ide of Newport. The allies, to the
number of &s;eventy thou&s;and, pa&s;&s;ed the Schelde, and ad|vanced
towards Helchin: but the enemy being &s;o advan|tageou&s;ly
po&s;ted, that they could not attack him with any
pro&s;pect of advantage, they filed on in &s;ight of Tournay;
and on the eighth day of Augu&s;t encamped in the plains of
Li&s;le, in hope of drawing Count Saxe from the &s;ituation
in which he was &s;o &s;trongly fortified. Here they foraged for
&s;everal days, and laid the open country under contribu|tion:
however, they made no attempt upon the place it|&s;elf,
which in all probability would have fallen into their
hands had they inve&s;ted it at their fir&s;t approach; for then
there was no other garri&s;on but two or three battalions
of militia; but Count Saxe &s;oon threw in a con&s;iderable
re-enforcement. The allies were unprovided with a train
of battering cannon; and their commanders would not
deviate from the u&s;ual forms of war. Be&s;ides, they were
divided in their opinions, and de&s;pi&s;ed one another. Ge|neral
Wade, who commanded the Engli&s;h and Hanove|rians,
was a vain, weak man, without confidence,
weight, or authority; and the Au&s;trian general, the
Duke d'Aremberg, was a proud, rapacious glutton,
devoid of talents and &s;entiment. After having re|mained
for &s;ome time in &s;ight of Li&s;le, and made a
general forage without mole&s;tation, they retired to their
<PB N="127" REF="133">
former camp on the Schelde, from whence they &s;oon
marched into winter-quarters. Count Saxe at length
quitted his lines; and, by way of retaliation, &s;ent out
detachments to ravage the Low-Countries, to the very
gates of Ghent and Bruges. The conduct of the allied
generals was &s;everely cen&s;ured in England, and ridiculed
in France, not only in private conver&s;ation but al&s;o on
their publick theatres, where it became the &s;ubject of
farces and pantomimes.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. The campaign in Italy produced divers vici&s;&s;i|tudes
of fortune. The King of Naples having a&s;&s;embled
an army, joined Count Gages, and publi&s;hed a manife&s;to
in vindication of his conduct, which was a direct viola|tion
of the neutrality he had promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve. He
maintained, that his moderation had been undervalued by
the courts of London and Vienna; that his frontiers were
threatened with the calamities of war; and that the
Queen of Hungary made no &s;ecret of her intention to
invade his dominions. This charge was not without
foundation. The emi&s;&s;aries of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria en|deavoured
to excite a rebellion in Naples, which Prince
Lobkowitz had orders to favour by an inva&s;ion. This
general was encamped at Monte Rotundo, in the neigh|bourhood
of Rome, when, in the month of June, the
confederates advanced to Velletri. While the two ar|mies
remained in &s;ight of each other, Prince Lobkowitz
detached a &s;trong body of forces, under Count Soro and
General Gorani, who made an irruption into the pro|vince
of Abruzzo, and took the city of Aquila, where
they di&s;tributed a manife&s;to, in which the Queen of Hun|gary
exhorted the Neapolitans to &s;hake off the Spani&s;h
yoke, and &s;ubmit again to the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. This
&s;tep, however, produced little or no effect; and the Au|&s;trian
detachment retired at the approach of the Duke of
Vieuville, with a &s;uperior number of forces. In Augu&s;t.
Count Brown, at the head of an Au&s;trian detachment.
$$rpri&s;ed Velletri in the night; and the King of the Two
$icilies, with the Duke of Modena, were in the utmo&s;t
<PB N="128" REF="134">
danger of being taken. They e&s;caped by a po&s;tern $word$
great difficulty, and repaired to the quarters of Cou$$
Gages, who performed the part of a great general $word$
this occa&s;ion. He rallied the fugitives, di&s;pelled the pa|nick
and confu&s;ion which had begun to prevail in his
camp, and made a di&s;po&s;ition for cutting off the retreat $word$
the Au&s;trians. Count Brown, finding him&s;elf in danger$
of being &s;urrounded, thought proper to &s;ecure his retreat$
which he affected with great art and gallantry, carrying of
a prodigious booty. Three thou&s;and Spaniards are &s;aid to
have fallen in this action; and eight hundred men were
taken, with &s;ome &s;tandards and colours. Count Mariani&punc;
a Neapolitan general, was among the pri&s;oners. Th$
Au&s;trians lo&s;t above &s;ix hundred men; and General Ne|vati
fell into the hands of the enemy; but the explo$$
produced no con&s;equence of importance. The heats $word$
autumn proved &s;o fatal to the Au&s;trians, who were n$$
accu&s;tomed to the climate, that Prince Lobkowitz &s;a$
his army mouldering away, without any po&s;&s;ibility $word$
its being recruited: be&s;ides the country was &s;o draine$
that he could no longer procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Impelled b$
the&s;e con&s;iderations, he meditated a retreat. On the
eleventh day of November, he decamped from Faiol$$
marched under the walls of Rome, pa&s;&s;ed the Tybur a$
Ponte Molle, formerly known by the name of Pons Mi$$vius,
which he had ju&s;t time to break down behind hi$$
when the vanguard of the Spaniards and Neapolitans ap|peared.
Part of his rear-guard, however, was taken
with Count Soro who commanded it, at Nocera; an$
his army &s;uffered greatly by de&s;ertion. Neverthele&s;s, $word$
continued his retreat with equal &s;kill and expedition$
pa&s;&s;ed the mountains of Gubio, and by the way of Vi|terbo
reached the Bologne&s;e. The Pope was altogethe$
pa&s;&s;ive. In the beginning of the campaign he had ca|re&s;&s;ed
Lobkowitz; and now he received the King $word$
the Two Sicilies with marks of the warme&s;t affection$
That prince having vi&s;ited the chief curio&s;ities of Rome$
<PB N="129" REF="135">
returned to Naples, leaving part of his troops under the
command of Count Gages.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. Fortune likewi&s;e favoured his brother Don
Philip in Savoy and Piedmont. He was early in the &s;ea|&s;on
joined at Antibes by the French army, under the con|duct
of the Prince of Conti. In the latter end of March,
the combined forces pa&s;&s;ed the Var, reduced the Ca&s;tle of
A&s;premont, and entered the city of Nice, without oppo|&s;ition.
In April, they attacked the King of Sardinia,
who, with twenty thou&s;and men, was &s;trongly entrenched
among the mountains at Villa-Franca. The action was
ob&s;tinate and bloody; but their numbers and per&s;everance
prevailed. He was obliged to abandon his po&s;ts, and em|$ark
on board of the Briti&s;h &s;quadron, which tran&s;ported
him and his troops to Vado. The intention of Don
Philip was to penetrate through the territories of Genoa
into the Milane&s;e; but Admiral Matthews, who hovered
with a &s;trong &s;quadron on that coa&s;t, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the
republic, declaring, that &s;hould the combined army be
&s;uffered to pa&s;s through her dominions, the King of Great-Britain
would con&s;ider &s;uch a &s;tep as a breach of their
neutrality. The &s;enate, intimidated by this intimation,
entreated the princes to defi&s;t from their de&s;ign; and they
re&s;olved to choo&s;e another route. They de&s;iled towards
Piedmont, and a&s;&s;aulted the &s;trong po&s;t of Chateau-Dau|phin&eacute;,
defended by the King of Sardinia in per&s;on. After
a de&s;perate attack, in which they lo&s;t four thou&s;and men,
the place was taken: the garri&s;on of Demont &s;urrendered
at di&s;cretion, and the whole country of Piedmont was laid
$nder contribution. His Sardinian Maje&s;ty was not in a
condition to hazard a battle; and, therefore, po&s;ted him&s;elf
$t Saluzzes, in order to cover his capital. The combined
$rmy advanced to the &s;trong and important town of Coni,
which was inve&s;ted in the beginning of September. Baron
Ce$trum the governor made an ob&s;tinate defence, and the
$tuation of the place was &s;uch as rendered the &s;iege diffi|$ult,
tedious, and bloody. The King of Sardinia being
re-enforced by ten thou&s;and Au&s;trians, under General Pal|lavicini,
<PB N="130" REF="136">
advanced to its relief, and a battle en&s;ued. The
action was maintained with great vigour on both &s;ides,
till night, when his Maje&s;ty finding it impracticable to
force the enemy's entrenchments, retired in good order to
his camp at Mura&s;&s;o. He afterwards found means to
throw a re-enforcement and &s;upply of provi&s;ions into Coni;
and the heavy rains that fell at this period, not only re|tarded,
but even di&s;pirited the be&s;iegers. Neverthele&s;s, the
princes per&s;i&s;ted in their de&s;ign, notwith&s;tanding a dearth
of provi&s;ions, and the approach of winter, till the latter
end of November, when the Chevalier de Soto entered
the place with &s;ix hundred fre&s;h men. This incident was
no &s;ooner known, than the princes abandoned their en|terpri&s;e;
and leaving their &s;ick and wounded to the mercy
of the Piedmonte&s;e, marched back to Demont. Having
di&s;mantled the fortifications of this place, they retreated
with great precipitation to Dauphin&eacute;, and were dread|fully
harra&s;&s;ed by the Vaudois and light troops in the &s;er|vice
of his Sardinian Maje&s;ty, who now again &s;aw him|&s;elf
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Piedmont. The French troops were
quartered in Dauphin&eacute;: but Don Philip &s;till maintained
his footing in Savoy, the inhabitants of which he fleeced
without mercy.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. After the action at Toulon, nothing of con&s;e|quence
was atchieved by the Briti&s;h &s;quadron in the Medi|terranean;
and indeed the naval power of Great-Britain
was, during the &s;ummer, quite inactive. In the month
of June, Commodore An&s;on returned from his voyage of
three years and nine months, in which he had &s;urrounded
the terraqueous globe. We have formerly ob&s;erved, that
he &s;ailed with a &s;mall &s;quadron to the South-Sea, in order
to annoy the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements of Chili and Peru. Two
of his large &s;hips having been &s;eparated from him in a &s;torm
before he weathered Cape-Horn, had put in at Rio de
Janiero, on the coa&s;t of Bra&s;il, from whence they re|turned
to Europe. A frigate, commanded by Captain
Cheap, was &s;hipwrecked on a de&s;olate i&s;land in the South-Sea.
Mr. An&s;on having undergone a dreadful tempe&s;t,
<PB N="131" REF="137">
which di&s;per&s;ed his fleet, arrived at the i&s;land of Juan
Fernandez, where he was joined by the Glouce&s;ter, a &s;hip
of the line, a &s;loop, and a pink loaded with provi&s;ions.
The&s;e were the remains of his &s;quadron. He made prize
of &s;everal ve&s;&s;els; took and burned the little town of
Payta; &s;et &s;ail from the coa&s;t of Mexico, for the Philip|pine
i&s;les; and in this pa&s;&s;age the Glouce&s;ter was aban|doned
and &s;unk: the other ve&s;&s;els had been de&s;troyed for
want of men to navigate them, &s;o that nothing now re|mained
but the commodore's own &s;hip, the Centurion, and
that but very indifferently manned; for the crews had
been horribly thinned by &s;ickne&s;s. Incredible were the
hard&s;hips and mi&s;ery they &s;u&s;tained from the &s;hattered con|dition
of the &s;hips, and the &s;corbutick di&s;order, when they
reached the plentiful i&s;land of Tinian, where they were
&s;upplied with the nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments. Thence they
pro&s;ecuted their voyage to the river of Canton in China,
where the commodore ordered the &s;hip to be &s;heathed, and
found means to procure a re-enforcement of &s;ailors. The
chief object of his attention was the rich annual &s;hip that
&s;ails between Acapulco in Mexico, and Manilla, one of
the Phillippine i&s;lands. In hopes of intercepting her, he
&s;et &s;ail from Canton, and &s;teered his cour&s;e back to the
&s;traits of Manilla, where &s;he actually fell into his hands,
after a &s;hort but vigorous engagement. The prize was
called Neu&s;tra Signora de Cabodonga, mounted with forty
guns, manned with &s;ix hundred &s;ailors, and loaded with
trea&s;ure and effects to the value of three hundred and thir|teen
thou&s;and pounds &s;terling: with this windfall, he re|turned
to Canton; from whence he proceeded to the
Cape of Good-Hope, and pro&s;ecuted his voyage to Eng|land,
where he arrived in &s;afety. Though this fortunate
commander enriched him&s;elf by an occurrence that may be
$ermed almo&s;t accidental, the Briti&s;h nation was not in|demnified
for the expen&s;e of the expedition; and the ori|ginal
de&s;ign was entirely defeated. Had the Manilla
&s;hip e&s;caped the vigilance of the Engli&s;h commodore, he
might have been, at his return to England, laid a&s;ide as a
<PB N="132" REF="138">
&s;uperannuated captain, and died in ob&s;curity: but his
great wealth inve&s;ted him with con&s;iderable influence, and
added lu&s;tre to his talents. He &s;oon became the oracle
which was con&s;ulted in all naval deliberations; and the
King rai&s;ed him to the dignity of a peerage. In July, Sir
John Balchen, an admiral of approved valour and great ex|perience,
&s;ailed from Spithead with a &s;trong &s;quadron, in
que&s;t of an opportunity to attack the French fleet at Bre&s;t,
under the command of M. de Rochambault. In the bay
of Bi&s;cay he was overtaken by a violent &s;torm, that di&s;per&s;ed
the &s;hips, and drove them up the Engli&s;h channel. Ad|miral
Stewart, with the greater part of them, arrived at
Plymouth; but Sir John Balchen's own &s;hip, the Victory,
which was counted the mo&s;t beautiful fir&s;t rate in the
world, foundered at &s;ea; and this brave commander pe|ri&s;hed,
with all his officers, volunteers, and crew, amount|ing
to eleven hundred choice &s;eamen. On the fourth day
of October, after the &s;iege of Friburg, the Mar&s;hal Duke
de Bellei&s;le, and his brother, happened, in their way to
Berlin, to halt at a village in the fore&s;t of Hartz, depend|ent
on the electorate of Hanover. There they were ap|prehended
by the bailiff of the place, and conducted as
pri&s;oners to O&s;terode; from whence they were removed to
Stade on the Elbe, where they embarked for England.
They re&s;ided at Wind&s;or till the following year, when they
were allowed the benefit of the cartel which had been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
between Great-Britain and France at Franckfort,
and relea&s;ed accordingly, after they had been treated by
the Briti&s;h nobility with that re&s;pect and ho&s;pitality which
was due to their rank and merit<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pope, the celebrated poet, died in the month of June. In Octo|ber, the old Duche&s;s of Marlborough re&s;igned her breath, in the eighty-fifth year of her age; immen&s;ely rich, and very little regretted, either by her own family, or the world in general.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The di&s;&s;entions in the Briti&s;h cabinet were
now ripened into another revolution in the mini&s;try.
Lord Carteret, who was by this time Earl Granville in
con&s;equence of his mother's death, had engro&s;&s;ed the royal
favour &s;o much, that the Duke of N&mdash;and his brother
<PB N="133" REF="139">
are &s;aid to have taken umbrage at his influence and great|ne&s;s.
He had incurred the re&s;entment of tho&s;e who were
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of Patriots, and entirely
forfeited his popularity. The two brothers were very
powerful by their parliamentary intere&s;t: they knew their
own &s;trength, and engaged in a political alliance with the
leading men in the oppo&s;ition, again&s;t the prime mini&s;ter
and his mea&s;ures. This coalition was dignified with the
epithet of &startq;The Broad Bottom,&endq; as if it had been e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
on a true con&s;titutional foundation, comprehending in|dividuals
of every cla&s;s, without di&s;tinction of party. The
appellation, however, which they a&s;&s;umed was afterwards
converted into a term of deri&s;ion. The Earl of G&mdash;
perceiving the gathering &s;torm, and fore&s;eeing the im|po&s;&s;ibility
of with&s;tanding &s;uch an oppo&s;ition in parlia|ment,
wi&s;ely avoided the impending danger and di&s;grace,
by a voluntary re&s;ignation of his employments. The
Earl of Harrington &s;ucceeded him as &s;ecretary of &s;tate.
The Duke of Bedford was appointed fir&s;t lord of the Ad|miralty,
and the Earl of Che&s;terfield declared lord-lieu|tenant
of Ireland. The Lords Gower and Cobham were
re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the offices they had re&s;igned: Mr. Lyttel|ton
was admitted as a commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury; even
Sir John Hynde Cotton accepted of a place at court; and
Sir John Phillips &s;at at the board of trade and plantations,
though he &s;oon renounced this employment. This was
rather a change of men than of mea&s;ures, and turned out
to the ea&s;e and advantage of the &s;overeign; for his views
were no longer thwarted by an ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition in
parliament. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened on the twenty-eighth
day of November, in the u&s;ual manner. The Commons
unanimou&s;ly granted about &s;ix millions and an half for
the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, to be rai&s;ed by the land,
the malt, and the &s;alt-taxes, the &s;inking-fund, and an
additional duty on wines. In January, the Earl of Che&s;ter|field
&s;et out for the Hague, with the character of am|ba&s;&s;ador
extraordinary, to per&s;uade, if po&s;&s;ible, the States-General
to engage heartily in the war. About the &s;ame
<PB N="134" REF="140">
time, a treaty of quadruple alliance was &s;igned at War|&s;aw,
by the Queen of Hungary, the King of Poland,
and the maritime powers. This was a mutual guarantee
of the dominions belonging to the contracting parties:
but his Poli&s;h maje&s;ty was paid for his concurrence, with
an annual &s;ub&s;idy of one hundred and fifty thou&s;and
pounds, two thirds of which were defrayed by England,
and the remainder was di&s;bur&s;ed by the United Pro|vinces<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Robert Earl of Orford, late prime mini&s;ter, died in March, after having for a very &s;hort time enjoyed a pen&s;ion of four thou&s;and pounds granted by the crown, in con&s;ideration of his pa&s;t &s;ervices. Though he had for &s;uch a length of time directed the application of the publick $ea|&s;ure, his circum&s;tances were not affluent: he was liberal in his di&s;po&s;i|tion, and had &s;uch a number of rapacious dependents to gratify, that lit|tle was left for his own private occa&s;ions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the Briti&s;h parliament being
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1745.</NOTE> the &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed in the beginning of
May; and immediately after the prorogation the King
&s;et out for Hanover. The death of the Emperor
Charles VII. which happened in the month of January,
had entirely changed the face of affairs in the em|pire,
and all the princes of Germany were in commotion.
The Grand Duke of Tu&s;cany, con&s;ort to her Hungarian
Maje&s;ty, was immediately declared a candidate for the
Imperial crown; while his preten&s;ions were warmly op|po&s;ed
by the French King and his allies. The court of
Vienna, taking advantage of the late Emperor's death,
&s;ent an army of invade Bavaria in the month of March,
under the conduct of General Bathiani, who routed
the French and Palatine troops at P&s;iffenhoven; took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Rain; &s;urrounded and di&s;armed &s;ix thou&s;and
He&s;&s;ians in the neighbourhood of Ingold&s;tadt; and drove
the Bavarian forces out of the electorate. The young
elector was obliged to abandon his capital, and retire to
Aug&s;burgh, where he found him&s;elf in danger of lo&s;ing
all his dominions. In this emergency, he yielded to
the earne&s;t &s;ollicitations of the Empre&s;s his mother, en|forced
by the advice of his uncle, the Elector of Cologn,
and of his general, Count Seckendorff, who exhorted him
<PB N="135" REF="141">
to be reconciled to the court of Vienna. A negotiation
was immediately begun at Fue&s;&s;en, where in April the
treaty was concluded. The Queen con&s;ented to recog|nize
the imperial dignity, as having been ve&s;ted in the
per&s;on of his father; to acknowledge his mother as Em|pre&s;s
Dowager; to re&s;tore his dominions, with all the
fortre&s;&s;es, artillery, &s;tores, and ammunition, which &s;he
had taken: on the other hand, he renounced all claim to
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of her father, and became guarantee of the
pragmatick &s;anction; he acknowledged the validity of
the electoral vote of Bohemia in the per&s;on of the Queen;
and engaged to give his voice for the Grand Duke, at
the en&s;uing election of a king of the Romans. Until
that &s;hould be determined, both parties agreed that Ingold|&s;tadt
&s;hould be garri&s;oned by neutral troops; and that
Braunau and Schardingen, with all the country lying
between the Inn and the Saltza, &s;hould remain in the
Queen's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, though without prejudice to the civil
government, or the Elector's revenue. In the mean
time he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the auxiliaries that were in his pay, and
they were permitted to retire without mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. The court of Vienna had now &s;ecured the votes
of all the electors, except tho&s;e of Brandenburgh and the
Palatinate. Neverthele&s;s, France a&s;&s;embled a powerful
army in the neighbourhood of Franckfort, in order to in|fluence
the election: But the Au&s;trian army, commanded
by the Grand Duke in per&s;on, marched thither from the
Danube; and the Prince of Conti was obliged to repa&s;s
the Rhine at Nordlingen. Then the Great Duke repaired
to Franckfort, where, on the &s;econd day of September,
he was by a majority of voices declared king of the
Romans, and emperor of Germany. Mean while the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia had made great progre&s;s in the conque&s;t
of Sile&s;ia. The campaign began in January, when the
Hungarian in&s;urgents were obliged to retire into Moravia:
In the following month the Pru&s;&s;ian General Lehwald
defeated a body of twelve thou&s;and Au&s;trians, commanded
by General Hel$rich: the town of Ratibor was taken by
<PB N="136" REF="142">
a&s;&s;ault; and the King entered Sile&s;ia in May, at the head
of &s;eventy thou&s;and men. Prince Charles of Lorraine,
being joined by the Duke of Saxe-We&s;&s;enfels and twenty-thou&s;and
Saxons, penetrated into Sile&s;ia by the defiles of
Land&s;hut; and were attacked by his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty in
the plains of Striegan, near Friedberg. The battle was
maintained from morning till noon, when the Saxons
giving way, Prince Charles was obliged to retire with the
lo&s;s of twelve thou&s;and men, and a great number of
colours, &s;tandards, and artillery. This victory, obtained on
the fourth day of June, complete as it was, did not prove
deci&s;ive; for, though the victor transferred the &s;eat of the
war into Bohemia, and maintained his army by rai&s;ing
contributions in that country, the Au&s;trians re&s;olved to
hazard another engagement. Their aim was to &s;urpri&s;e
him in his camp at Sohr, which they attacked on the thir|tieth
of September, at day-break: but they met with &s;uch
a warm reception, that notwith&s;tanding their repeated ef|forts
during the &s;pace of four hours, they were repul&s;ed
with con&s;iderable damage, and retreated to Jaromire, leaving
five thou&s;and killed upon the &s;pot, be&s;ides two thou&s;and
that were taken, with many &s;tandards, and twenty pieces of
cannon. The lo&s;s of this battle was in a great mea&s;ure
owing to the avarice of the irregulars, who having pene|trated
into the Pru&s;&s;ian camp, began to pillage with great
eagerne&s;s, giving the King an opportunity to rally his
di&s;ordered troops, and re&s;tore the battle: neverthele&s;s,
they retired with the plunder of his baggage, including
his military che&s;t, the officers of his chancery, his own
&s;ecretary, and all the papers of his cabinet.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. After this action his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty returned
to Berlin, and breathed nothing but peace and modera|tion.
In Augu&s;t he had &s;igned a convention with the
King of Great-Britain, who became guarantee of his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Sile&s;ia, as yielded by the treaty of Bre&s;lau;
and he promi&s;ed to vote for the Grand Duke of Tu&s;cany
at the election of an emperor. This was intended as
the ba&s;is of a more general accommodation. But he
<PB N="137" REF="143">
now pretended to have received undoubted intelligence,
that the King of Poland and the Queen of Hungary had
agreed to invade Brandenburgh with three different ar|mies;
and that for this purpo&s;e his Poli&s;h Maje&s;ty had
demanded of the Czarina the &s;uccours &s;tipulated by
treaty between the two crowns. Alarmed, or &s;eemingly
alarmed, at this information, he &s;ollicited the maritime
powers to fulfil their engagements, and interpo&s;e their
good offices with the court of Peter&s;burgh. Yet, far from
waiting for the re&s;ult of the&s;e remon&s;trances, he made a
&s;udden irruption into Lu&s;atia, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gorlitz,
and obliged Prince Charles of Lorraine to retire before
him into Bohemia. Then he entered Leip&s;ick, and laid
Saxony under contribution. The King of Poland, un|able
to re&s;i&s;t the torrent, quitted his capital, and took re|fuge
in Prague. His troops, re-enforced by a body of
Au&s;trians, were defeated at Pirna on the fifteenth day of
December; and his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty became ma&s;ter of
Dre&s;den without further oppo&s;ition. The King of Po|land,
thus deprived of his hereditary dominions, was
fain to acquie&s;ce in &s;uch terms as the conqueror thought
proper to impo&s;e; and the treaty of Dre&s;den was con|cluded,
under the mediation of his Britannick Maje&s;ty.
By this convention the King of Pru&s;&s;ia retained all the
contributions he had levied in Saxony; and was entitled
to a million of German crowns, to be paid by his Po|li&s;h
Maje&s;ty at the next fair of Leip&s;ick. He and the
Elector Palatine con&s;ented to acknowledge the Grand
Duke as Emperor of Germany; and this la&s;t confirmed
to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty certain privileges <HI>de non evocando,</HI>
which had been granted by the late Emperor, with regard
to &s;ome territories po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia,
though not belonging to the electorate of Brandenburgh.
Immediately after the ratification of this treaty, the Pru&s;|&s;ian
troops evacuated Saxony; and the peace of Germa|ny
was re&s;tored.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. Though the French King could not prevent
the elevation of the Grand Duke to the Imperial throne,
<PB N="138" REF="144">
he re&s;olved to humble the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, by making a
conque&s;t of the Netherlands. A prodigious army was there
a&s;&s;embled, under the au&s;pices of Mare&s;chal Count de Saxe;
and his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, with the Dauphin, ar|riving
in the camp, they inve&s;ted the &s;trong town of
Tournay on the thirtieth day of April. The Dutch garri|&s;on
con&s;i&s;ted of eight thou&s;and men, commanded by the old
Baron Dorth, who made a vigorous defence. The Duke
of Cumberland a&s;&s;umed the chief command of the allied
army a&s;&s;embled at Soignies: he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the ad|vice
of the Count Konig&s;eg, an Au&s;trian general, and
the Prince of Waldeck, commander of the Dutch forces.
Their army was greatly inferior in number to that of the
enemy; neverthele&s;s, they re&s;olved to march to the relie$
of Tournay. They accordingly advanced to Leu&s;e; and
on the twenty-eighth day of April took po&s;t at Maulbre,
in fight of the French army, which was encamped on an
eminence, from the village of Antoine to a large wood
beyond Vezon, having Fontenoy in their front. Next
day was employed by the allies in driving the enemy from
&s;ome outpo&s;ts, and clearing the defiles through which
they were obliged to advance to the attack; while the
French completed their batteries, and made the mo&s;t for|midable
preparations for their reception. On the thirtieth
day of April the Duke of Cumberland having made the
proper di&s;po&s;itions, began his march to the enemy at two
o'clock in the morning: a bri&s;k cannonade en&s;ued; and
about nine both armies were engaged. The Briti&s;h in|fantry
drove the French beyond their lines: but the left
wing failing in the attack on the village of Fontenoy, and
the cavalry forbearing to advance on the flanks, they
mea&s;ured back their ground with &s;ome di&s;order, from the
prodigious fire of the French batteries. They rallied,
however, and returning to the charge with redoubled ar|dour,
repul&s;ed the enemy to their camp with great &s;laugh|ter:
but, being wholly un&s;upported by the other wing,
and expo&s;ed both in front and flank to a dreadful fire,
which did great execution, the Duke was obliged to make
<PB N="139" REF="145">
$e nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions for a retreat about three o'clock
$word$ the afternoon; and this was effected in tolerable or|$er.
The battle was fought with great ob&s;tinacy, and the
$arnage on both &s;ides was very con&s;iderable. The allies
$word$ about twelve thou&s;and men, including a good number
$f officers; among the&s;e were Lieutenant-General Camp|$ell,
and Major-General Pon&s;onby. The victory co&s;t the
$rench almo&s;t an equal number of lives; and no honour
was lo&s;t by the vanqui&s;hed. Had the allies given battle
$n the preceding day, before the enemy had taken their
mea&s;ures, and received all their re-enforcements, they
might have &s;ucceeded in their endeavours to relieve Tour|$ay.
Although the attack was generally judged ra&s;h and
$recipitate, the Briti&s;h and Hanoverian troops fought
with &s;uch intrepidity and per&s;everance, that if they had
$een properly &s;u&s;tained by the Dutch forces, and their
$anks covered by the cavalry, the French, in all likeli|hood,
would have been obliged to abandon their enter|pri&s;e.
The Duke of Cumberland left his &s;ick and wound|$d
to the humanity of the victors; and retiring to Aeth,
$ncamped in an advantageous &s;ituation at Le&s;&s;ines. The
$arri&s;on of Tournay, though now deprived of all hope
$f &s;uccour, maintained the place to the twenty-fir&s;t day
$f June, when the governor obtained an honourable capi|$ulation.
After the conque&s;t of this frontier, which was
$i&s;mantled, the Duke of Cumberland, apprehending the
$nemy had a de&s;ign upon Ghent, &s;ent a detachment of
$our thou&s;and men to re-enforce the garri&s;on of that city:
$ut they fell into an ambu&s;cade at Pas-du-m&ecirc;le; and
were killed or taken, except a few dragoons that e&s;cap|$d
to O&s;tend: on that very night, which was the twelfth
of June, Ghent was &s;urpri&s;ed by a detachment of the
French army. Then they inve&s;ted O&s;tend, which,
though defended by an Engli&s;h garri&s;on, and open to the
&s;ea, was after a &s;hort &s;iege &s;urrendered by capitulation on
$he fourteenth day of Augu&s;t. Dendermonde, Oude|$arde,
Newport, and Aeth underwent the &s;ame fate;
while the allied army lay entrenched beyond the canal of
<PB N="140" REF="146">
Antwerp. The French King having &s;ubdued the greate&s;t
part of the Au&s;trian Netherlands, returned to Paris, which
he entered in triumph.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. The campaign in Italy was unpropitious to
the Queen of Hungary and the King of Sardinia. Count
Gages pa&s;&s;ed the Appennines; and entered the &s;tate of Luc|ca:
from thence he proceeded by the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of
Genoa to Le&s;tride-Levante. The junction of the two
armies was thus accompli&s;hed, and re-enforced with ten
thou&s;and Genoe&s;e: mean while Prince Lobkowitz de|camped
from Modena, and took po&s;t at Parma: but he
was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by Count Schuylemberg, and &s;ent to
command the Au&s;trians in Bohemia. The Spaniards en|tered
the Milane&s;e without further oppo&s;ition. Count
Gages, with thirty thou&s;and men, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ser|ravalle;
and advancing towards Placentia, obliged the
Au&s;trians to retire under the cannon of Tortona: but
when Don Philip, at the head of forty thou&s;and troops,
made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Acqui, the King of Sardinia and
the Au&s;trian general, unable to &s;tem the torrent, re|treated
behind the Tanaro. The &s;trong citadel of Torto|na
was taken by the Spaniards, who likewi&s;e reduced
Parma and Placentia: and forcing the pa&s;&s;age of the Ta|naro,
compelled his Sardinian Maje&s;ty to take &s;helter on
the other &s;ide of the Po. Then Pavia was won by &s;ca|lade;
and the city of Milan &s;ubmitted to the Infant,
though the Au&s;trian garri&s;on &s;till maintained the citadel:
all Piedmont, on both &s;ides of the Po, as far as Turin,
was reduced, and even that capital threatened with a
&s;iege: &s;o that by the month of October the territories be|longing
to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, in Italy, were wholly
&s;ubdued; and the King of Sardinia &s;tripped of all his do|minions:
yet he continued firm and true to his engage|ments,
and deaf to all propo&s;als of a &s;eparate accommo|dation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. The naval tran&s;actions of Great-Britain were
in the cour&s;e of this year remarkably &s;pirited. In the
Mediterranean, Admiral Rowley had &s;ucceeded Matthews
<PB N="141" REF="147">
in the command: Savona, Genoa, Final, St. Remo, with
Ba&s;tia, the capital of Cor&s;ica, were bombarded: &s;everal
Spani&s;h &s;hips were taken: but he could not prevent the
&s;afe arrival of their rich Havannah &s;quadron at Corunna.
Commodore Barnet, in the Ea&s;t-Indies, made prize of
&s;everal French &s;hips richly laden; and Commodore Town|&s;hend,
in the latitude of Martinico, took about thirty mer|chant
&s;hips belonging to the $nemy, under convoy of four
&s;hips of war, two of which were de&s;troyed. The Engli&s;h
privateers likewi&s;e met with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s. But the
mo&s;t important atchievement was the conque&s;t of Loui&s;|bourg
on the i&s;le of Cape-Breton, in North-America; a
place of great con&s;equence, which the French had for|tified
at a prodigious expen&s;e. The &s;cheme of reducing
this fortre&s;s was planned in Bo&s;ton, recommended by their
general a&s;&s;embly, and approved by his Maje&s;ty, who &s;ent
in&s;tructions to Commodore Warren, &s;tationed off the Lee|ward-I&s;lands,
to &s;ail for the northern parts of America,
and co-operate with the forces of New-England in this
expedition. A body of &s;ix thou&s;and men was formed un|der
the conduct of Mr. Pepperel, a trader of Pi&s;cataquay,
who&s;e influence was exten&s;ive in that country; though
he was a man of little or no education, and utterly unac|quainted
with military operations. In April Mr. Warren
arrived at Can&s;o with ten &s;hips of war; and the troops of
New-England being embarked in tran&s;ports, &s;ailed im|mediately
for the I&s;le of Cape-Breton, where they landed
without oppo&s;ition. The enemy abandoned their grand
$attery, which was detached from the town: and the im|mediate
&s;ei&s;ure of it contributed in a good mea&s;ure to the
&s;ucce&s;s of the enterpri&s;e. While the American troops,
re-enforced by eight hundred marines, carried on their
approaches by land, the &s;quadron blocked up the places by
&s;ea in &s;uch a manner, that no &s;uccours could be introduced.
A French &s;hip of the line, with &s;ome &s;maller ve&s;&s;els de|&s;tined
for the relief of the garri&s;on, were intercepted and
taken by the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers; and, indeed, the reduction
of Loui&s;bourg was chiefly owing to the vigilance and activity
<PB N="142" REF="148">
of Mr. Warren, one of the brave&s;t and be&s;t officers in the
&s;ervice of England. The operations of the &s;iege were
wholly conducted by the engineers and officers who com|manded
the Briti&s;h marines; and the Americans being
ignorant of war, were contented to act under their direc|tions.
The town being con&s;iderably damaged by the
bombs and bullets of the be&s;iegers, and the garri&s;on de|&s;pairing
of relief, the governor capitulated on the &s;even|teenth
day of June, when the city of Loui&s;bourg, and the
i&s;le of Cape-Breton, were &s;urrendered to his Britannick
Maje&s;ty. The garri&s;on and inhabitants engaged that
they would not bear arms for twelve months again&s;t Great-Britain
or her allies; and being embarked in fourteen
cartel &s;hips, were tran&s;ported to Rochefort. In a few days
after the &s;urrender of Loui&s;bourg, two French Ea&s;t-India-&s;hips,
and another from Peru, laden with trea&s;ure, &s;ailed
into the harbour, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that it &s;till belonged
to France, and were taken by the Engli&s;h &s;quadron.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. The news of this conque&s;t being tran&s;mitted to
England, Mr. Pepperel was preferred to the dignity of a
baronet of Great-Britain, and congratulatory addre&s;&s;es were
pre&s;ented to the King on the &s;ucce&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's arms.
The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cape-Breton was, doubtle&s;s, a valuable
acqui&s;ition to Great Britain. It not only di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the
French in their fi&s;hery and navigation, but removed all
fears of encroachment and rival&s;hip from the Engli&s;h fi&s;h|ers
on the banks of Newfoundland. It freed New-England
from the terrors of a dangerous neighbour: over-awed the
Indians of that country; and &s;ecured the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Acadia to the crown of Great-Britain. The plan of
this conque&s;t was originally laid by Mr. Auchmuty,
judge-advocate of the court of Admiralty in New-En|gland.
He demon&s;trated that the reduction of Cape-Breton
would put the Engli&s;h in &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
fi&s;hery of North-America, which would annually return
to Great-Britain two millions &s;terling for the manu|factures
yearly &s;hipped to the plantations; employ many
<PB N="143" REF="149">
thou&s;and families that were otherwi&s;e un&s;erviceable to the
publick; increa&s;e the &s;hipping and mariners; extend
navigation; cut off all communication between France
and Canada by the river St. Laurence; &s;o that Quebeck
would fall of cour&s;e into the hands of the Engli&s;h, who
might expel the French entirely from America, open a
corre&s;pondence with the remote Indians, and render them|&s;elves
ma&s;ters of the profitable fur-trade, which was now
engro&s;&s;ed by the enemy. The natives of New-England
acquired great glory from the &s;ucce&s;s of this enterpri&s;e
Britain, which had in &s;ome in&s;tances behaved like a
&s;tepmother to her own colonies, was now convinced of
their importance; and treated tho&s;e as brethren whom &s;he
had too long con&s;idered as aliens and rivals. Circum|&s;tanced
as the nation is, the legi&s;lature cannot too
tenderly cheri&s;h the intere&s;ts of the Briti&s;h plantations
in America. They are inhabited by a brave, hardy, in|du&s;trious
people, animated with an active &s;pirit of com|merce;
in&s;pired with a noble zeal for liberty and inde|pendence.
The trade of Great-Britain, clogged with
heavy taxes and impo&s;itions, has for &s;ome time langui&s;hed
in many valuable branches. The French have under&s;old
our cloths, and &s;poiled our markets in the Levant. Spain
is no longer &s;upplied as u&s;ual with the commodities of
England: the exports to Germany mu&s;t be con&s;iderably
dimini&s;hed by the mi&s;under&s;tanding between Great-Bri|tain
and the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; con&s;equently her greate&s;t
re&s;ource mu&s;t be in her communication with her own co|lonies,
which con&s;ume her manufactures, and make im|men&s;e
returns in &s;ugar, rum, tobacco, fi&s;h, timber, naval
&s;tores, iron, furs, drugs, rice, and indigo. The &s;outhern
plantations likewi&s;e produce &s;ilk; and with due encourage|ment
might furni&s;h every thing that could be expected
from the mo&s;t fertile &s;oil and the happie&s;t climate. The
continent of North-America, if properly cultivated, will
prove an inexhau&s;tible fund of wealth and &s;trength to
Great-Britain; and perhaps it may become the la&s;t a&s;ylum

de&s;poti&s;m or foreign dominion; when her &s;ub|&s;tance
is wa&s;ted, her &s;pirit broke, and the laws and con|&s;titution
of England are no more: then tho&s;e colonies

<P>&sect; XXVI. While the continent of Europe and the
i&s;les of America were thus expo&s;ed to the ravages of wa$
and &s;ubjected to &s;uch vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, Great-Bri|tain
underwent a dangerous convul&s;ion in her own
bowels. The &s;on of the Chevalier de St. George, fire
with ambition, and animated with the hope of a&s;cendin$
the throne of his ance&s;tors, re&s;olved to make an effort $word$
that purpo&s;e, which, though it might not be crowne
with &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hould at lea&s;t a&s;toni&s;h all Chri&s;tendo$
The Jacobites in England and Scotland had promi&s;e$
that if he would land in Britain at the head of a regul$
army, they would &s;upply him with provi&s;ions, carriage
and hor&s;es, and a great number of them declared the$
would take up arms, and join his &s;tandard: but they di$|approved
of his coming over without forces, as a dange|rous
enterpri&s;e, that would in all probability end in th$
ruin of him&s;elf and all his adherents. This advice, in|cluding
an exact detail of his father's intere&s;t, with th$
di&s;po&s;itions of his particular friends in every town an$
county, was tran&s;mitted to London in January, in ord$
to be forwarded to Prince Charles; but the per&s;on wit$
whom it was entru&s;ted could find no &s;afe method of con|veyance;
&s;o that he &s;ent it back to Scotland, from whence
it was di&s;patched to France; but before it reached Pari$
Charles had left that kingdom. Had the paper come t$
his hands in due time, perhaps he would not have em|barked
in the undertaking, though he was &s;timulated $word$
the attempt by many concurring motives. Certain it i$
he was cajoled by the &s;anguine mi&s;repre&s;entations of $word$
few adventurers, who hoped to profit by the expedition.
They a&s;&s;ured him that the whole nation was di&s;affected to
the reigning family: that the people could no longer bea$
the immen&s;e load of taxes, which was daily increa&s;ing; and
<PB N="145" REF="151">
that the mo&s;t con&s;iderable per&s;ons of the kingdom would
gladly &s;ei&s;e the fir&s;t opportunity of crowding to his &s;tan|dard.
On the other hand, he knew the Briti&s;h govern|ment
had taken &s;ome effectual &s;teps to alienate the friends
of his hou&s;e from the principles they had hitherto pro|fe&s;&s;ed.
Some of them had accepted po&s;ts and pen&s;ions:
others were preferred in the army; and the parliament
were &s;o attached to the reigning family, that he had no|thing
to hope from their deliberations. He expected no
material &s;uccour from the court of France: he fore&s;aw
that delay would dimini&s;h the number of his adhe|rents
in Great-Britain; and therefore, re&s;olved to &s;ei&s;e
the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, which in many re&s;pect was propi|tious
to his de&s;ign. Without doubt, had he been properly
&s;upported, he could not have found a more favourable
opportunity of exicting an inte&s;tine commotion in Great-Britain:
for Scotland was quite unfurni&s;hed with troops;
King George was in Germany; the Duke of Cumber|land,
at the head of the Briti&s;h army, was employed in
Flanders, and great part of the Highlanders were keen for
in&s;urrection. Their natural principles were on this occa|&s;ion
&s;timulated by the &s;ugge&s;tions of revenge. At the
beginning of the war, a regiment of tho&s;e people had
been formed, and tran&s;ported with the re&s;t of the Briti&s;h
troops to Flanders. Before they were embarked, a num|ber
of them de&s;erted with their arms, on pretence that
they had been decoyed into the &s;ervice, by promi&s;es and
a&s;&s;urances that they &s;hould never be &s;ent abroad; and
this was really the ca&s;e. They were overtaken by a
body of hor&s;e, per&s;uaded to &s;ubmit, brought back to Lon|don
pinioned like malefactors, and tried for de&s;ertion.
Three were &s;hot to death <HI>in terrorem;</HI> and the re&s;t were
&s;ent in exile to the plantations. Tho&s;e who &s;uffered were
per&s;ons of &s;ome con&s;equence in their own country; and
their fate was deeply re&s;ented by the clans to which
they belonged. It was con&s;idered as a national outrage;
and the Highlanders, who are naturally vindictive, waited
impatiently for an opportunity of vengeance.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="152">
&sect; XXVII. The young Pretender being furni&s;hed
with a &s;um of money, and a &s;upply of arms, on his
private credit, without the knowledge of the French
court, wrote letters to his friends in Scotland, explaining
his de&s;ign and &s;ituation, intimating the place where he
inteded to land, communicating a private &s;ignal, and
a&s;&s;uring them he &s;hould be with them by the middle of
June. The&s;e precautions being taken, he embarked on
board of a &s;mall frigate at Port St. Nazaire, accompanied
by the Marquis of Tullibardine, Sir Thomas Sheridan,
Sir John Macdonal, with a few other Iri&s;h and Scotti&s;h
adventurers; and &s;etting &s;ail on the fourteenth of July,
was joined off Bellei&s;le by the Eli&s;abeth, a French &s;hip
of war, mounted with &s;ixty-&s;ix guns, as his convoy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Eli&s;abeth, a king's &s;hip, was procured as a convoy, by the intere&s;t of Mr. Wal&s;h, an Iri&s;h merchant at Nantes; and on board of her fifty $word$ young gentlemen embarked as volunteers.</NOTE>.
Their de&s;ign was to &s;ail round Ireland, and land in the
we&s;tern part of Scotland: but falling in with the Lion,
an Engli&s;h &s;hip of the line, a very ob&s;tinate and
bloody action en&s;ued. The Eli&s;abeth was &s;o di&s;abled
that &s;he could not pro&s;ecute the voyage, and with diffi|culty
reached the harbour of Bre&s;t: but the Lion was
&s;hattered to &s;uch a degree, that &s;he floated like a wreck
upon the water. The de&s;a&s;ter of the Eli&s;abeth was a
great misfortune to the Adventurer, as by her being di&s;|abled
he lo&s;t a great quantity of arms, and about one
hundred able officers, who were embarked on board of
her for the benefit of his expedition. Had this &s;hip ar|rived
in Scotland, &s;he could ea&s;ily have reduced Fort-William,
&s;ituated in the mid&s;t of the clans attached to
the Stuart family. Such a conque&s;t, by giving lu&s;tre to
the Prince's arms, would have a&s;&s;ured many to his &s;tan|dard,
who were indifferent in point of principle; and en|couraged
a great number of Highlanders to join him,
who were re&s;tricted by the apprehen&s;ion, that their wives
and families would be &s;ubject to in&s;ults from the Engli&s;h
garri&s;on of this $orte&s;s. Prince Charles in the friga$$
<PB N="147" REF="153">
continued his cour&s;e to the we&s;tern i&s;les of Scotland.
After a voyage of eighteen days he landed on a little i&s;land
between Barra and South In&s;t, two of the Hebrides:
then he re-marked, and in a few days arrived at Bora|dale
in Arn&s;acy, on the confines of Lochnannach, where
he was in a little time joined by a con&s;iderable number
of hardy moutainers, under their re&s;pective chiefs or
leaders. On the nineteenth day of Augu&s;t, the Marquis
of Tullibardine erected the Pretender's &s;tandard at Glen|&s;innan.
Some of tho&s;e, however, on whom Charles
principally depended, now &s;tood aloof, either fluctuating
in their principles, a&s;toni&s;hed at the boldne&s;s of the un|dertaking,
or &s;tartled at the remon&s;trances of their friends,
who did not fail to repre&s;ent, in aggravated colours, all
the danger of embarking in &s;uch a de&s;perate enterpri&s;e.
Had the government acted with proper vigour when they
received intelligence of his arrival, the Adventurer mu&s;t
have been cru&s;hed in embrio, before any con&s;iderable num|ber
of his adherents could have been brought together:
but the lords of the regency &s;eemed to &s;light the infor|mation,
and even to &s;u&s;pect the integrity of tho&s;e by
whom it was conveyed. They were &s;oon convinced of
their mi&s;take. Prince Charles, having a&s;&s;embled about
twelve hundred men, encamped in the neighbourhood of
Fort-William; and immediately ho&s;tilities were com|menced.
A handful of Keppoch's clan, commanded by
Major Donald Mac Donald, even before they joined the
Pretender, attacked two companies of new-rai&s;ed &s;oldiers,
who, with their officer, were di&s;armed after an ob&s;tinate
di&s;pute: another captain of the King's forces, falling in|to
their hands, was courteou&s;ly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with one of the
Pretender's manife&s;tos, and a pa&s;&s;port for his per&s;onal &s;afe|ty.
The admini&s;tration was now effectually alarmed.
The lords of the regency i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, offering
a reward of thirty thou&s;and pounds to any per&s;on who
&s;hould apprehend the Prince-Adventurer. The &s;ame
price was &s;et upon the head of the elector of Hanover,
in a proclamation publi&s;hed by the Pretender. A courier
<PB N="148" REF="154">
was di&s;patched to Holland, to ha&s;ten the return of his Ma|je&s;ty,
who arrived in England about the latter end of
Augu&s;t. A requi&s;ition was made of the &s;ix thou&s;and
Dutch auxiliaries; and &s;everal Briti&s;h regiments were re|called
from the Netherlands. A loyal addre&s;s was pre|&s;ented
to the King by the city of London; and the mer|chants
of this metropolis re&s;olved to rai&s;e two regiments
at their own expen&s;e. Orders were i&s;&s;ued to keep the
trained-bands in readine&s;s; to array the militia of We&s;t|mini&s;ter;
and in&s;tructions to the &s;ame effect were &s;ent
to all the lord-lieutenants of the counties through|out
the kingdom. The principal noblemen of the nation
made a tender of their &s;ervices to their &s;overeign; and
&s;ome of them received commi&s;&s;ions to levy regiments to|wards
the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the rebellion. Bodies of volun|teers
were incorporated in London, and many other
places; a&s;&s;ociations were formed, large contributions
rai&s;ed in different towns, counties, and communities;
and a great number of eminent merchants in London
agreed to &s;upport the publick credit, by receiving, as u&s;ual,
Bank notes in payment, for the purpo&s;es of traffick. The
prote&s;tant clergy of all denominations exerted them&s;elves
with extraordinary ardour, in preaching again&s;t the reli|gion
of Rome and the Pretender; and the friends of the
government were encouraged, animated, and confirmed
in their principles, by &s;everal &s;piritual productions pub|li&s;hed
for the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. In a word, the bulk of the nation &s;eemed
unanimou&s;ly bent upon oppo&s;ing the enterpri&s;e of the
Pretender, who, neverthele&s;s, had already made &s;urpri&s;ing
progre&s;s. His arrival in Scotland was no &s;ooner con|firmed,
than Sir John Cope, who commanded the troops
in that kingdom, a&s;&s;embled what force he could bring
together, and advanced again&s;t the rebels. Under&s;tanding,
however, that they had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong pa&s;s,
he changed his route, and proceeded northwards as far as
Inverne&s;s, leaving the capital and the &s;outhern parts of
North-Britain wholly expo&s;ed to the incur&s;ions of the
<PB N="149" REF="155">
enemy. The Highlanders forthwith marched to Perth,
where the Chavalier de St. George was proclaimed king
of Great-Britain, and the publick money &s;ei&s;ed for his
u&s;e: the &s;ame &s;teps were taken at Dundee, and other
places. Prince Charles was joined by the nobleman
who a&s;&s;umed the title of Duke of Perth, the Vi&s;|count
Strathallan, Lord Nairn, Lord George Murray,
and many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, with their followers.
The Marquis of Tullibardine, who had accompanied him
from France, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Athol, as heir of blood
to the titles and e&s;tate which his younger brother enjoyed
in con&s;equence of his attainder; and met with &s;ome &s;uc|ce&s;s
in arming the tenants for the &s;upport of that cau&s;e
which he avowed. The rebel army being con&s;iderably
augmented, though very ill provided with arms, cro&s;&s;ed
the Forth in the neighbourhood of Stirling, and advanced
towards Edinburgh, where they were joined by Lord El|cho,
&s;on of the Earl of Wemys, and other per&s;ons of
&s;ome di&s;tinction. On the &s;ixteenth day of September,
Charles &s;ummoned the town to &s;urrender. The inhabi|tants
were divided by faction, and di&s;tracted by fear: the
place was not in a po&s;ture of defence, and the magi&s;trates
would not expo&s;e the people to the uncertain i&s;&s;ue of an
a&s;&s;ult. Several deputations were &s;ent from the town to
the Pretender, in order to negociate terms of capitulation.
In the mean time, one of the gates being opened for
the admi&s;&s;ion of a coach, Cameron of Lochiel, one of
the mo&s;t powerful of the highland chiefs, ru&s;hed into the
place with a party of his men, and &s;ecured it without
oppo&s;ition. Next morning the whole rebel army entered,
and their prince took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the royal palace of
Holyrood-hou&s;e, in the &s;uburbs. Then he cau&s;ed his
father to be proclaimed at the market-cro&s;s: there al&s;o
the manife&s;to was read, in which the Chevalier de St.
George declared his &s;on Charles regent of his dominions,
promi&s;ed to di&s;&s;olve the Union, and redre&s;s the grievances
of Scotland. His being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital encou|raged
his followers, and added reputation to his arms:
<PB N="150" REF="156">
but the trea&s;ure belonging to the two banks of that king|dom
had been previou&s;ly conveyed into the ca&s;tle, a
&s;trong fortre&s;s, with a good garri&s;on, under the command
of General Gue&s;t, an old officer of experience and capa|city.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Sir John Cope
marched back from Inverne&s;s to Aberdeen, where he em|barked
with his troops, and on the &s;eventeenth day of
September landed at Dunbar, about twenty miles to the
ea&s;tward of Edinburgh. Here he was joined by two regi|ments
of dragoons, which had retired with precipitation
from the capital at the approach of the Highland army.
With this re-enforcement, his troops amounted to
near three thou&s;and men; and he began his march to
Edinburgh, in order to give battle to the enemy. On
the twentieth day of the month, he encamped in the
neighbourhood of Pre&s;ton-pans, having the village of
Tranent in his front, and the &s;ea in his rear. Early next
morning he was attacked by the young Pretender, at the
head of about two thou&s;and four hundred Highlanders
half-armed, who charged him &s;word in hand with &s;uch
impetuo&s;ity, that in le&s;s than ten minutes after the battle
began the King's troops were broken and totally routed.
The dragoons &s;led in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion at the fir&s;t
on&s;et: the general officers having made &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful
efforts to rally them, thought proper to con&s;ult their own
&s;afety by an expeditious retreat towards Cold&s;tream on the
Tweed. All the infantry were either killed or taken;
and the colours, artillery, tents, baggage, and military
che&s;t, fell into the hands of the victor, who returned
in triumph to Edinburgh. Never was victory more com|plete,
or obtained at a &s;maller expen&s;e; for not above
fifty of the rebels lo&s;t their lives in the engagement.
Five hundred of the King's troops were killed on the
field of battle; and among the&s;e Colonel Gardiner, a
gallant officer, who di&s;dained to &s;ave his life at the ex|pen&s;e
of his honour. When abandoned by his own re|giment
of dragoons, he alighted from his hor&s;e, joined
<PB N="151" REF="157">
the infantry, and fought on foot, until he fell covered
with wounds, in &s;ight of his own thre&s;hold. Prince
Charles bore his good fortune with moderation. He pro|hibited
all rejoicings for the victory he had obtained:
the wounded &s;oldiers were treated with humanity; and
the officers were &s;ent into Fife and Angus, where they
were left at liberty on their parole, which the greater
part of them &s;hamefully broke in the &s;equel. From this
victory the Pretender reaped manifold and important ad|vantages.
His followers were armed, his party encou|raged,
and his enemies intimidated. He was &s;upplied
with a train of field-artillery, and a con&s;ierable &s;um of
money, and &s;aw him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all Scotland, except
the fortre&s;&s;es, the reduction of which he could not pre|tend
to undertake without proper implements and engi|neers.
After the battle he was joined by a &s;mall detach|ment
from the Highlands; and &s;ome chiefs, who had hi|therto
been on the re&s;erve, began to exert their influence
in his favour. But he was not yet in a condition to take
advantage of that con&s;ternation which his late &s;ucce&s;s
had diffu&s;ed through the kingdom of England.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. Charles continued to re&s;ide in the palace of
Holyrood-hou&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">While he re&s;ided at Edinburgh, &s;ome of the pre&s;byterian clergy conti|nued to preach in the churches of that city, and publickly prayed for King George, without &s;uffering the lea&s;t puni&s;hment or mole&s;tation. One mini&s;ter in particular, of the name of Mac Vicar, being &s;ollicited by &s;ome Highlanders to pray for their prince, promi&s;ed to comply with their re|que&s;t, and performed his promi&s;e in words to this effect: &startq;And as for the young prince, who is come hither in que&s;t of an earthly crown, grant, O Lord, that he may &s;peedily receive a crown of glory.&endq;.</NOTE>: and took mea&s;ures for cutting off
the communication between the ca&s;tle and the city. Ge|neral
Gue&s;t declared that he would demoli&s;h the city,
unle&s;s the blockade &s;hould be rai&s;ed, &s;o as that provi&s;ion
might be carried into the ca&s;tle. After having waited
the return of an expre&s;s which he had found means to
di&s;patch to court, he began to put his threats in execu|tion,
by firing upon the town. Some hou&s;es were beaten
down, and &s;everal per&s;ons killed even at the market-cro&s;s.
<PB N="152" REF="158">
The citizens, alarmed at this di&s;a&s;ter, &s;ent a deputation
to the prince, entreating him to rai&s;e the blockade; and
he complied with their reque&s;t. He levied a regiment in
Edinburgh and the neighbourhood. He impo&s;ed taxes;
&s;ei&s;ed the merchandi&s;e that was depo&s;ited in the King's
warehou&s;es at Leith, and other palces; and complled
the city of Gla&s;gow to accommodate him with a large
&s;um, to be repaid when the peace of the kingdom &s;hould
be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. The number of his followers daily
increa&s;ed: and he received con&s;iderable &s;upplies of money,
artillery, and ammunition, by &s;ingle &s;hips that arrived
from France, where his intere&s;t &s;eemed to ri&s;e in propor|tion
to the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms. The greater and richer
part of Scotland was aver&s;e to his family and preten|&s;ions:
but the people were unarmed and undi&s;ciplined,
con&s;equently pa&s;&s;ive under his dominion. By this time,
however, the Prince-Pretender was joined by the Earl of
Kilmarnock, the Lords Elcho, Balmerino, Ogilvy, Pit|&s;ligo;
and the elde&s;t &s;on of Lord Lovat had begun to
a&s;&s;emble his father's clan, in order to re-enforce the vic|tor,
who&s;e army lay encamped at Dudding&s;ton, in the
neighbourhood of Edinburgh. Kilmarnock and Balme|rino
were men of broken and de&s;perate fortune: Elcho
and Ogilvy were &s;ons to the Earls of Wemys and Arily;
&s;o that their influence was far from being exten&s;ive.
Pit&s;ligo was a nobleman of a very amiable character, as
well as of great per&s;onal intere&s;t; and great dependence
was placed upon the power and attachment of Lord Lo|vat,
who had entered into private engagements with the
Chevalier de St. George, though he &s;till wore the mark
of loyalty to the government, and di&s;avowed the conduct
of his &s;on when he declared for the Pretender. This old
nobleman is the &s;ame Simon Fra&s;er whom we have had
occa&s;ion to mention as a parti&s;an and emi&s;&s;ary of the
court of St. Germain's in the year one thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and three. He had renounced his connexions
with that family; and, in the rebellion immediately after
the acce&s;&s;ion of King George I. approved him&s;elf a warm
<PB N="153" REF="159">
friend to the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Since that period he
had been induced, by di&s;gu&s;t and ambition, to change his
principles again, and was in &s;ecret an enthu&s;ia&s;t in ja|cobiti&s;m.
He had greatly augmented his e&s;tate, and ob|tained
a con&s;iderable intere&s;t in the Highlands, where,
however, he was rather dreaded than beloved. He was
bold, enterpri&s;ing, vain, arbitary, rapacious, cruel, and
deceitful: but his character was chiefly marked by a
&s;pecies of low cunning and di&s;&s;imulation, which, how|ever,
over&s;hot his purpo&s;e, and contributed to his own
ruin. While Charles re&s;ided at Edinburgh, the Mar|quis
de Guilles arrived at Montro&s;e, as envoy from the
French King, with &s;everal officers, &s;ome cannon, and
a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;mall arms for the u&s;e of that
adventurer<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">He &s;ollicited, and is &s;aid to have obtained of the Chevalier de St. George, the patent of a duke, and a commi&s;&s;ion for being lord-lieutenant $f all Highlands.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. While the young Pretender endeavoured
to improve the advantages he had gained, the mini&s;try
of Great-Britain took every po&s;&s;ible mea&s;ure to retard his
progre&s;s. Several powerful chiefs in the Highlands were
attached to the government, and exerted them&s;elves in its
defence. The Duke of Argyle began to arm his va&s;&s;als;
but, not before he had obtained the &s;anction of the le|gi&s;lature.
Twelve hundred men were rai&s;ed by the
Earl of Sutherland: the Lord Rae brought a con&s;ider|able
number to the field: the Grants and Monores
appeared under their re&s;pective leaders for the &s;ervice
of his Maje&s;ty: Sir Alexander Macdonald declared
or King George, and the Laird of Macleod &s;ent two
thou&s;and hardy i&s;landers from Skie, to &s;trengthen the
&s;ame intere&s;t. The&s;e gentlemen, though &s;uppo&s;ed to
be otherwi&s;e affected, were governed and directed by
the advice of Duncan Forbes, pre&s;ident of the College of
Ju&s;tice at Edinburgh; a man of exten&s;ive knowledge,
agreeable manners, and unblemi&s;hed integrity. He
procured commi&s;&s;ions for rai&s;ing twenty independent
<PB N="154" REF="160">
companies, and &s;ome of the&s;e he be&s;towed upon indivi$duals
who were either attached by principle, or engage$
by promi&s;e, to the Pretender. He acted with indefatiga$ble
zeal for the intere&s;t of the reigning family; and great$ly
injured an opulent fortune in their &s;ervice. He con$firmed
&s;everal chiefs who began to waver in their princi+ples:
&s;ome he actually converted by the energy of hi$
arguments, and brought over to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the go$vernment,
which they had determined to oppo&s;e: other$
he per&s;uaded to remain quiet, without taking any &s;ha$$
in the pre&s;ent troubles. Certain it is, this gentleman,
by his indu&s;try and addre&s;s, prevented the in&s;urrection o$|ten
thou&s;and Highlanders, who would otherwi&s;e have
joined the Pretender; and, therefore, he may be &s;aid to
have been one great cau&s;e of that Adventurer's mi&s;carriage&punc;
The Earl of London repaired to Inverne&s;s, where he
completed his regiment of Highlanders; directed the
conduct of the clans who had taken arms in behalf o$
his Maje&s;ty; and, by his vigilance, overawed the di&s;af|fected
chieftains of that country, who had not yet open|ly
engaged in the rebellion. Immediately after the defea$
of Cope, &s;ix thou&s;and Dutch troops<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They were compo&s;ed of the forces who had been in garri&s;on at Tournay and Dendermonde when tho&s;e places were taken, and engaged by capitulation, that they &s;hould not perform any military function before the fir&s;t day of January in the year 1747; &s;o they could not have acted in England without the infringement of a &s;olemn treaty.</NOTE> arrived in England,
and three battalions of guards, with &s;even regiments of
infantry, were recalled from Flanders, for the defence of
the kingdom. They forthwith began their march to the
North, under the command of General Wade, who re|ceived
orders to a&s;&s;emble an army, which proceeded to
Newca&s;tle. The parliament meeting on the &s;ixteenth day
of October, his Maje&s;ty gave them to under&s;tand, that
an unnatural rebellion had broke out in Scotland, towards
the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of which he craved their advice and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.
He found both Hou&s;es cordial in their addre&s;&s;es,
and zealous in their attachment to his per&s;on and govern|ment.
The Commons forthwith &s;u&s;pended the Habeas
<PB N="155" REF="161">
Corpus act; and &s;everal per&s;ons were apprehended on
&s;u&s;picion of trea&s;onable practices. Immediately after the
$e&s;&s;ion was opened the Duke of Cumberland arrived from
the Netherlands, and was followed by another detach|ment
of dragoons and infantry. The trained-bands of
London were reviewed by his Maje&s;ty: the county regi|ments
were completed: the volunteers, in different parts
of the kingdom, employed them&s;elves indu&s;triou&s;ly in the
$xerci&s;e of arms; and the whole Engli&s;h nation &s;eemed to
$&s;e up as one man again&s;t this formidable invader. The
government being apprehen&s;ive of a de&s;cent from France,
appointed Admiral Vernon to command a &s;quadron in
$he Downs, to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy by &s;ea,
&s;pecially in the harbours of Dunkirk and Boulogn; and
$is crui&s;ers took &s;everal &s;hips laden with &s;oldiers, officers,
$nd ammunition, de&s;tined for the &s;ervice of the Pretender
$n Scotland.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. This enterpri&s;ing youth, having collected
about five thou&s;and men, re&s;olved to make an irruption
into England, which he accordingly entered by the we&s;t
$order on the &s;ixth day of November. Carli&s;le was in|$e&s;ted,
and in le&s;s than three days &s;urrendered: the keys
were delivered to him at Brampton, by the mayor and
$ldermen on their knees. Here he found a con&s;iderable
$uantity of arms: his father was proclaimed king of
Great-Britain, and him&s;elf regent; by the magi&s;trates
$n their formalities. General Wade being appri&s;ed of
his progre&s;s, decamped from Newca&s;tle, and advanced
$cro&s;s the country as far as Hexham, though the fields
were covered with &s;now, and the roads almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able.
There he received intelligence that Carli&s;le was reduced,
and forthwith returned to his former &s;tation. In the
mean time, orders were i&s;&s;ued for a&s;&s;embling another ar|my
in Stafford&s;hire, under the command of Sir John Li|$gonier.
Prince Charles, notwith&s;tanding this formidable
oppo&s;ition, determined to proceed. He had received a&s;&s;u|rances
from France, that a con&s;iderable body of troops
would be landed on the &s;outhern coa&s;t of Britain, to make
<PB N="156" REF="162">
a diver&s;ion in his favour; and he never doubted but that
he &s;hould be joined by all the Engli&s;h malcontents, as
&s;oon as he could penetrate into the heart of the kingdom&punc;
Leaving a &s;mall garri&s;on in the ca&s;tle of Carli&s;le, he ad|vanced
to Penrith, marching on foot in the Highland
garb, at the head of his forces; and continued his route
through Lanca&s;ter and Pre&s;ton to Manche&s;ter, where, on
the twenty-ninth day of the month, he e&s;tabli&s;hed his
head-quarters. There he was joined by about two hun|dred
Engli&s;hmen, who were formed into a regiment, un|der
the command of Colonel Townley. The inhabitants
&s;eemed to receive him with marks of affection; and his
arrival was celebrated by illuminations, and other publick
rejoicings. His &s;uppo&s;ed intention was to pro&s;ecute his
march by the way of Che&s;ter into Wales, where he hoped
to find a great number of adherents: but all the bridges
over the river Mer&s;ey being broken down, he cho&s;e the
route to Stockport, and forded the river at the head of
his divi&s;ion, though the water ro&s;e to his middle. He
pa&s;&s;ed through Macclesfield and Congleton; and on the
fourth day of December entered the town of Derby, in
which his army was quartered, and his father proclaimed
with great formality. He had now advanced within one
hundred miles of the capital, which was filled with ter|rour
and confu&s;ion. Wade lingered in York&s;hire: the
Duke of Cumberland had a&s;&s;umed the command of the
other army a&s;&s;embled in the neighbourhood of Lichfield.
He had marched from Stafford to Stone; &s;o that the re|bels,
in turning off by A&s;hborne to Derby, had gained a
march between him and London. Had Charles proceeded
in his career with that expedition which he had hitherto
u&s;ed, he might have made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the metro|polis,
where he would have been certainly joined by a
con&s;iderable number of his well-wi&s;hers, who waited im|patiently
for his approach: yet this exploit could not
have been atchieved without hazarding an engagement,
and running the ri&s;que of being enclo&s;ed within three ar|mies,
each greatly &s;uperior to his own in number and
<PB N="157" REF="163">
artillery. Orders were given for forming a camp on
$nchley-common, where the King re&s;olved to take the
$eld in per&s;on, accompanied by the Earl of Stair, field-$are&s;chal
and commander in chief of the forces in South-Britain.
Some Romi&s;h prie&s;ts were apprehended: the
$ilitia of London and Middle&s;ex were kept in readine&s;s
$word$ march: double watches were po&s;ted at the city-gates,
$nd &s;ignals of alarm appointed. The volunteers of the
$ity were incorporated into a regiment: the practitioners
$word$ the law, headed by the judges, the weavers of Spital-$$elds,
and other communities, engaged in a&s;&s;ociations;
$nd even the managers of the theatres offered to rai&s;e a
$ody of their dependents for the &s;ervice of the govern|ment.
Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions and appear|ances
of unanimity, the trading part of the city, and
$ho&s;e concerned in the money-corporations, were over|whelmed
with fear and dejection. They repo&s;ed very
$$ttle confidence in the courage or di&s;cipline of their mi|$$tia
and volunteers: they had received intelligence that
$he French were employed in making preparations at
$unkirk and Calais for a de&s;cent upon England: they
$readed an in&s;urrection of the Roman Catholics, and
$ther friends of the hou&s;e of Stuart; and they reflected
$hat the Highlanders, of whom by this time they had
$onceived a mo&s;t terrible idea, were within four days
$arch of the capital. Alarmed by the&s;e con&s;iderations,
$hey progno&s;ticated their own ruin in the approaching
$evolution; and their countenances exhibited the plaine&s;t
marks of horrour and de&s;pair. On the other hand, the
$acobites were elevated to an in&s;olence of hope, which
$hey were at no pains to conceal; while many people,
who had no private property to lo&s;e, and thought no
change would be for the wor&s;e, waited the i&s;&s;ue of this
$ri&s;is with the mo&s;t calm indifference.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. This &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e was of &s;hort dura|tion.
The young Pretender found him&s;elf mi&s;erably di&s;|appointed
in his expectations. He had now advanced in|to
the middle of the kingdom, and except a few that
<PB N="158" REF="164">
joined him at Manche&s;ter, not a &s;oul appeared in his be|half:
one would have imagined that all the Jacobites of
England had been annihilated. The Welch took no &s;tep
to excite an in&s;urrection in his favour: the French made
no attempt towards an inva&s;ion; his court was divided
into factions: the Highland chiefs began to murmur, and
their clans to be unruly: he &s;aw him&s;elf with a handful
of men hemmed in between two con&s;iderable armies, in
the middle of winter, and in a country di&s;affected to his
cau&s;e. He knew he could not proceed to the metropo|lis
without hazarding a battle, and that a defeat would
be attended with the inevitable de&s;truction of him&s;elf and
all his adherents; and he had received information that
his friends and officers had a&s;&s;embled a body of forces in
the North, &s;uperior in number to tho&s;e by whom he was
attended. He called a council at Derby: and propo&s;ed
to advance towards London: the propo&s;al was &s;upported
by Lord Nairn with great vehemence: but, after violent
di&s;putes, the majority determined that they &s;hould re|treat
to Scotland with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. Accord|ingly,
they abandoned Derby on the &s;ixth day of Decem|ber,
early in the morning, and mea&s;ured back the route
by which they had advanced. On the ninth their van|guard
arrived at Manche&s;ter: on the twelfth they entered
Pre&s;ton, and continued their march northwards. The
Duke of Cumberland, who was encamped at Meriden,
when fir&s;t appri&s;ed of their retreat, detached the hor&s;e
and dragoons in pur&s;uit of them; while General Wade
began his march from Ferrybridge into Lanca&s;hire, with
a view of intercepting them in their route: but at Wake|field
he under&s;tood that they had already reached Wigan:
he, therefore, repaired to his old po&s;t at Newca&s;tle, after
having detached General Oglethorpe, with his hor&s;e and
dragoons, to join tho&s;e who had been &s;ent off from the
Duke's army. They pur&s;ued with &s;uch alacrity, that
they overtook the rear of the rebels, with which they
&s;kirmi&s;hed, in Lanca&s;hire. The militia of Cumberland
and We&s;tmorland were rai&s;ed and armed by the Duke's
<PB N="159" REF="165">
order, to harra&s;s them in their march. The bridges were
broken down, the roads damaged, and the beacons lighted
$word$ alarm the country. Neverthele&s;s, they retreated re|gularly
with their &s;mall train of artillery. They were
$vertaken at the village of Clifton, in the neighbourhood
$f Penrith, by two regiments of dragoons. The&s;e alighted,
$nd lined the hedges, in order to harra&s;s part of the
$nemy's rear-guard, commanded by Lord John Murray;
who, at the head of the Macpher&s;ons, attacked the
dragoons &s;word in hand, and repul&s;ed them with &s;ome lo&s;s.
On the nineteenth day of the month, the Highland army
$eached Carli&s;le, where the majority of the Engli&s;h in
the &s;ervice of the Pretender were left, at their own de|$ire.
Charles, having re-enforced the garri&s;on of the
place, cro&s;&s;ed the rivers Eden and Solway into Scotland,
having thus accompli&s;hed one of the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing retreats
that ever was performed. But the mo&s;t remarkable cir|cum&s;tance
of this expedition, was the moderation and
$egularity with which tho&s;e ferocious people conducted
them&s;elves in a country abounding with plunder. No
violence was offered; no outrage committed; and they
were effectually re&s;trained from the exerci&s;e of rapine.
Notwith&s;tanding the exce&s;&s;ive cold, the hunger, and fatigue
$o which they mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed, they left behind
$o &s;ick, and lo&s;t a very few &s;tragglers; but retired with
deliberation, and carried off their cannon in the face of
their enemy. The Duke of Cumberland inve&s;ted Car|li&s;le
with his whole army on the twenty-fir&s;t day of De|cember,
and on the thirtieth the garri&s;on &s;urrendered on
$word$ &s;ort of capitulation made with the Duke of Richmond.
The pri&s;oners, amounting to about four hundred, were
impri&s;oned in different gaols in England, and the Duke
returned to London.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. The Pretender proceeded by the way of
Dumfries to Gla&s;gow, from which la&s;t city he exacted
&s;evere contributions, on account of its attachment to the
government, for who&s;e &s;ervice it had rai&s;ed a regiment
of nine hundred men, under the command of the Earl of
<PB N="160" REF="166">
Home. Having continued &s;everal days at Gla&s;gow, $word$
advanced towards Stirling, and was joined by &s;ome
forces which had been a&s;&s;embled in his ab&s;ence by Lord$
Lewis Gordon and John Drummond, brothers to the
Dukes of Gordon and Perth. This la&s;t nobleman had
arrived from France in November, with a &s;mall re-en|forcement
of French and Iri&s;h, and a commi&s;&s;ion as ge|neral
of the&s;e auxiliaries. He fixed his head-quarters a$
Perth, where he was re-enforced by the Earl of Cro|martie,
and other clans, to the number of two thou&s;and
and he was accommodated with a &s;mall train of artillery.
They had found means to &s;urpri&s;e a &s;loop of war at Mon|tro&s;e,
with the guns of which they fortified that harbour&punc;
They had received a con&s;iderable &s;um of money from Spain.
They took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dundee, Dumblaine, Down|ca&s;tle,
and laid Fife under contribution. The Earl of
London remained at Inverne&s;s, with about two thou&s;and$
Highlanders in the &s;ervice of his Maje&s;ty. He convoyed
provi&s;ions to Fort-Augu&s;tus and Fort-William: he &s;e|cured
the per&s;on of Lord Lovat, who &s;till tempori&s;ed
and at length this cunning veteran accompli&s;hed his e&s;cape$&punc;
The Laird of Macleod, and Mr. Monro of Culcaira$
being detached from Inverne&s;s towards Aberdeen&s;hire
were &s;urpri&s;ed and routed by Lord Lewis Gordon at Inve$|rary;
and that intere&s;t &s;eemed to preponderate in the
north of Scotland. Prince Charles being joined by Lord
John Drummond, inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Stirling, i$
which General Blakeney commanded: but, his people
were &s;o little u&s;ed to enterpri&s;es of this kind, that they
made very little progre&s;s in their operations.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. By this time, a con&s;iderable body of force
was a&s;&s;embled at Edinburgh, under the conduct of Ge|neral
Hawley, who determined to relieve Stirling-ca&s;tle
and advanced to Linlithgow on the thirteenth day of Ja|nuary:
next day his whole army rendezvou&s;ed at Falkir$
while the rebels were cantoned about Bannockburn. O$
the &s;eventeenth day of the month, they began the
march in two columns to attack the King's forces, a$
<PB N="161" REF="167">
had forded the water of Carven, within three miles of
Hawley's camp, before he di&s;covered their intention.
Such was his ob&s;tinacy, &s;elf conceit, or contempt of
the enemy, that he &s;lighted the repeated intelligence he
had received of their motions and de&s;ign, firmly believing
they dur&s;t not hazard an engagement. At length, per|ceiving
they had occupied the ri&s;ing ground to the &s;outh|ward
of Falkirk, he ordered his cavalry to advance, and
drive them from the eminence; while his infantry form|ed,
and were drawn up in order of battle. The High|landers
kept up their fire, and took aim &s;o well, that the
a&s;&s;ailants were broke by the fir&s;t volley: they retreated
with precipitation, and fell in among&s;t the infantry,
which were likewi&s;e di&s;compo&s;ed by the wind and rain
beating with great violence in their faces, wetting their
powder, and di&s;turbing their eye-&s;ight. Some of the
dragoons rallied, and advanced again to the charge, with
part of the infantry which had not been engaged:
then the Pretender marched up at the head of his corps
$word$ re&s;erve, con&s;i&s;ting of the regiment of Lord John Drum|mond,
and the Iri&s;h piqu$ts. The&s;e, re-enforcing the
Camerons and the Stuarts in the front line, immediately
obliged the dragoons to give way a &s;econd time; and
they again di&s;ordered the foot in their retreat. They &s;et
fire to their camp, and abandoned Falkirk with their
baggage and train, which la&s;t had never reached the
field of battle. The rebels followed their fir&s;t blow, and
great part of the royal army, after one irregular di&s;charge,
$urned their backs, and $led in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation.
$n all probability few or none of them would have
$&s;caped, had not General Hu&s;ke, and Brigadier Chol|$ondeley,
rallied part of &s;ome regiments, and made a gal|$ant
&s;tand, which favoured the retreat of the re&s;t to
$alkirk, from whence they retired in confu&s;ion to Edin|burgh,
leaving the field of battle, with part of their
$$nts and artillery, to the rebels: but their lo&s;s of men
$word$ not exceed three hundred, including Sir Robert Mon|$$,
Colonel Whitney, and &s;ome other officers of di|&s;tinction.
<PB N="162" REF="168">
It was at this period, that the officers who
had been taken at the battle of Pre&s;ton-pans, and con|veyed
to Angus and Fife, finding them&s;elves unguarded,
broke their parole, and returned to Edinburgh, on pre|tence
of their having been forcibly relea&s;ed by the inhabi|tants
of tho&s;e parts<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sir Peter Halket, Captain Lucy Scott, Lieutenants Farqu$ar&s;on at Cumming, with a few other gentlemen, adhered punctually to their pa$e$ and their conduct was approved by his Maje&s;ty.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. General Hawley, who had boa&s;ted that,
with two regiments of dragoons, he would drive the rebel
army from one end of the kingdom to the other, incurred
abundance of cen&s;ure for the di&s;po&s;ition he made, as well as
for his conduct before and after the action: but he found
means to vindicate him&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction of his &s;ove|reign.
Neverthele&s;s, it was judged nece&s;&s;ary that the
army in Scotland &s;hould be commanded by a general in
whom the &s;oldiers might have &s;ome confidence; and the
Duke of Cumberland was cho&s;en for this purpo&s;e. Over
and above his being beloved by the army, it was &s;ugge&s;ted,
that the appearance of a prince of the blood in Scot|land
might have a favourable effect upon the minds of
people in that kingdom: he, therefore, began to prepare
for his northern expedition. Mean while, the French
mini&s;ter at the Hague having repre&s;ented to the States-General,
that the auxiliaries which they had &s;ent into
Great-Britain were part of the garri&s;ons of Tournay
and Dendermonde, and re&s;tricted by the capitulation from
bearing arms again&s;t France for a certain term, the
States thought proper to recall them, rather than come to
an open rupture with his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty. In
the room of tho&s;e troops &s;ix thou&s;and He&s;&s;ians were tran&s;|ported
from Flanders to Leith, where they arrived in the
beginning of February, under the command of their
prince, Frederick of He&s;&s;e, &s;on-in-law to his Britan|nick
maje&s;ty. By this time the Duke of Cumberland had
put him&s;elf at the head of the troops in Edinburgh, con|&s;i&s;ting
of fourteen battalions of infantry, two regiments
of dragoons, and twelve hundred Highlanders from Ar|gyle&s;hire,
<PB N="163" REF="169">
under the command of Colonel Campbell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VIII. 1746.</NOTE> On
the la&s;t day of January, his royal higne&s;s began his
march to Linlithgow; and the enemy, who had renewed
the &s;iege of Stirling-ca&s;tle, not only abandoned that en|terpri&s;e,
but cro&s;&s;ed the river Forth with precipitation.
Their prince found great difficulty in maintaining his
forces, that part of the country being quite exhau&s;ted.
He hoped to be re-enforced in the Highlands, and to re|ceive
&s;upplies of all kinds from France and Spain: he,
therefore, retired by Badenoch towards Inverne&s;s, which
the Earl of Lo$don abandoned at his approach. The fort
was &s;urrendered to him almo&s;t without oppo&s;ition, and
here he fixed his head quarters. His next exploit was the
&s;iege of Fort-Augu&s;tus, which he in a little time reduced.
The Duke of Cumberland having &s;ecured the important
po&s;ts of Stirling and Perth, with the He&s;&s;ian battalions,
advanced with the army to Aberdeen, where he was
joined by the Duke of Gordon, the Earls of Aberdeen
and Findlater, the Laird of Grant, and other per&s;ons of
di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. While he remained in this place, re|fre&s;hing
his troops, and preparing magazines, a party of
the rebels &s;urpri&s;ed a detachment of King&s;ton's hor&s;e,
and about &s;eventy Argyle&s;hire Highlanders, at Keith, who
were either killed or taken. Several advanced parties of
that militia met with the &s;ame fate in different places.
Lord George Murray inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Blair, which
was defended by Sir Andrew Agnew, until a body of
He&s;&s;ians marched to its relief, and obliged the rebels to
retire. The Prince-Pretender ordered all his forces to
a&s;&s;emble, in order to begin their march for Aberdeen, to
attack the Duke of Cumberland: but, in con&s;equence of
a remon&s;trance from the clans, who declined leaving
their families at the mercy of the King's garri&s;on in Fort-William,
he re&s;olved previou&s;ly to reduce that fortre&s;s,
the &s;iege of which was undertaken by Brigadier Stapleton,
an engineer in the French &s;ervice: but the place was
&s;o vigorou&s;ly maintained by Captain Scot, that in the
<PB N="164" REF="170">
beginning of April they thought proper to relinqui&s;h the
enterpri&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1746.</NOTE> The Earl of London had retired into Suther|land,
and taken po&s;t at Dornoch, where his quarters
were beat up by a &s;trong detachment of the rebels, com|manded
by the Duke of Perth: a major and &s;ixty men
were taken pri&s;oners; and the Earl was obliged to take
&s;helter in the I&s;le of Skye. The&s;e little checks were
counter-balanced by &s;ome advantages which his Maje&s;ty's
arms obtained. The &s;loop of war which the rebels had
&s;urpri&s;ed at Montro&s;e was re-taken in Sutherland, with
a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, and a great quantity of
arms on board, which &s;he had brought from France for
the u&s;e of the Pretender. In the &s;ame county, the Earl of
Cromartie fell into an ambu&s;cade, and was taken by the
militia of Sutherland, who likewi&s;e defeated a body of
the rebels at Gold&s;pie. This action happened on the
very day which has been rendered famous by the victory
obtained at Culloden.</P>

<P>&sect; I. IN the beginning of April the Duke of Cumber|land
began his march from Aberdeen; and on the
twelfth pa&s;&s;ed the deep and rapid river Spey, without op|po&s;ition
from the rebels, though a detachment of them ap|peared
on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. Why they did not di&s;pute the
pa&s;&s;age is not ea&s;y to be conceived: but, indeed, from
this in&s;tance of neglect, and their &s;ub&s;equent conduct, we
may conclude they were under a total infatuation. His
royal highne&s;s proceeded to Nairn, where he received in|telligence,
that the enemy had advanced from Inverne&s;s to
Culloden, about the di&s;tance of nine miles from the royal
army, with intention to give him battle. The de&s;ign of
Charles, was to march in the night from Culloden, and
&s;urpri&s;e the Duke's army at day-break: for this purpo&s;e
the Engli&s;h camp had been reconnoitred; and on the
night of the fifteenth the Highland army began to march
in two columns. Their de&s;ign was to &s;urround the ene|my,
and attack them at once on all quarters: but the
length of the columns embarra&s;&s;ed the march, &s;o that the
army was obliged to make many halts: the men had been
under arms during the whole preceding night, were faint
with hunger and fatigue, and many of them overpowered
with &s;leep. Some were unable to proceed: others dropped
off unperceived in the dark; and the march was retarded
in &s;uch a manner, that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to
reach the Duke's camp before &s;un-ri&s;e. The de&s;ign being
thus fru&s;trated, the Prince-Pretender was with great re|luctance
prevailed upon by his general officers to mea&s;ure
back his way to Culloden; at which place he had no &s;ooner
arrived, than great numbers of his followers di&s;per&s;ed in
que&s;t of provi&s;ion; and many, overcome with wearine&s;s and
<PB N="167" REF="173">
&s;leep, threw them&s;elves down on the heath, and along the
park walls. Their repo&s;e, however, was &s;oon interrupted
in a very di&s;agreeable manner. Their prince receiving
intelligence that his enemies were in full march to attack
him, re&s;olved to hazard an engagement, and ordered his
troops to be formed for that purpo&s;e. On the &s;ixteenth
day of April, the Duke of Cumberland having made the
proper di&s;po&s;itions, decamped from Nairn early in the
morning, and after a march of nine miles perceived the
Highlanders drawn up in order of battle, to the number of
four thou&s;and men, in thirteen divi&s;ions, &s;upplied with
&s;ome pieces of artillery. The royal army, which was
much more numerous, the Duke immediately formed into
three lines, di&s;po&s;ed in excellent order; and about one
o'clock in the afternoon the cannonading began. The ar|tillery
of the rebels was ill &s;erved, and did very little ex|ecution:
but that of the King's troops made dreadful ha|vock
among the enemy. Impatient of this fire, their front|line
advanced to the attack, and about five hundred of the
clans charged the Duke's left wing with their u&s;ual impe|tuo&s;ity.
One regiment was di&s;ordered by the weight of this
column: but two battalions advancing from the &s;econd
line, &s;u&s;tained the fir&s;t, and &s;oon put a &s;top to their career,
by a &s;evere fire, that killed a great number. At the &s;ame
time, the dragoons under Hawley, and the Argyle&s;hire
militia, pulled down a park-wall that covered their right
&s;lank, and the cavalry falling in among the rebels, &s;word
in hand, completed their confu&s;ion. The French piquets
on their left covered the retreat of the Highlanders by a
clo&s;e and regular fire; and then retired to Inverne&s;s, where
they &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. An entire
body of the rebels marched off the field in order, with their
pipes playing, and the Pretender's &s;tandard di&s;played: the
re&s;t were routed with great &s;laughter; and their prince
was with reluctance prevailed upon to retire. In le&s;s than
thirty minutes, they were totally defeated, and the field co|vered
with the &s;lain. The road, as far as Inverne&s;s, was
&s;trewed with dead bodies; and a good number of people,
<PB N="168" REF="174">
who, from motives of curio&s;ity, had come to &s;ee the battle,
were &s;acrificed to the undi&s;tingui&s;hing vengeance of the
victors. Twelve hundred rebels were &s;lain or wounded on
the field, and in the pur&s;uit. The Earl of Kilmarnock
was taken; and in a few days Lord Balmerino &s;urrender|ed
to a country gentleman, at who&s;e hou&s;e he pre&s;ented
him&s;elf for this purpo&s;e. The glory of the victory was &s;ul|lied
by the barbarity of the &s;oldiers. They had been pro|voked
by their former di&s;graces to the mo&s;t &s;avage thir&s;t
of revenge. Not contented with the blood which was &s;o pro|fu&s;ely
&s;hed in the heat of action, they traver&s;ed the field
after the battle, and ma&s;&s;acred tho&s;e mi&s;erable wretches
who lay maimed and expiring; nay, &s;ome officers acted a
part in this cruel &s;cene of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination: the triumph of
low illiberal minds, unin&s;pired by &s;entiment, untinctured
by humanity. The vanqui&s;hed adventurer rode off the
field, accompanied by the Duke of Perth, Lord Elcho,
and a few hor&s;emen: he cro&s;&s;ed the water of Nairn, and
retired to the hou&s;e of a gentleman in Strutharrick, where
he conferred with old Lord Lovat: then he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his
followers, and wandered about a wretched and &s;olitary fu|gitive
among the i&s;les and mountains, for the &s;pace of five
months, during which he underwent &s;uch a &s;eries of dan|gers,
hard&s;hips, and mi&s;ery, as no other per&s;on ever out|lived.
Thus, in one &s;hort hour, all his hope vani&s;hed, and
the rebellion was entirely extingui&s;hed. One would al|mo&s;t
imagine the conductors of this de&s;perate enterpri&s;e
had con&s;pired their own de&s;truction, as they certainly ne|glected
every &s;tep that might have contributed to their &s;afe|ty
or &s;ucce&s;s. They might have oppo&s;ed the Duke of
Cumberland at the pa&s;&s;age of the Spey; they might, by
proper conduct, have afterwards attacked his camp in the
night, with a good pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. As they were
greatly inferior to him in number, and weakened with
hunger and fatigue, they might have retired to the hills
and fa&s;tne&s;&s;es where they would have found plenty of live
cattle for provi&s;ion, recruited their regiments, and been
joined by a &s;trong re-enforcement, which was actually in
<PB N="169" REF="175">
all march to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But they were di&s;tracted by
$&s;&s;entions and jealou&s;ies: they obeyed the dictates of de|$air,
and wilfully devoted them&s;elves to ruin and death.
When the news of the battle arrived in England, the na|$$on
was tran&s;ported with joy, and extolled the Duke of
Cumberland as a hero and deliverer. Both Hou&s;es of par|$ament
congratulated his Maje&s;ty on the au&s;picious event.
They decreed, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, their publick
$hanks to his royal highne&s;s, which were tran&s;mitted to
him by the Speakers; and the Commons, by bill, added
$ive-and twenty thou&s;and pounds per annum to his former
$evenue.</P>
<P>&sect; II. Immediately after the deci&s;ive action at Culloden,
$he Duke took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Inverne&s;s, where &s;ix-and-thirty
$$e&s;erters, convicted by a court-martial, were ordered to be
executed: then he detached &s;everal parties to ravage the
country. One of the&s;e apprehended the Lady Mackinto&s;h,
who was &s;ent pri&s;oner to Inverne&s;s. They did not plun|der
her hou&s;e, but drove away her cattle, though her hu&s;|band
was actually in the &s;ervice of government. The ca&s;|tle
of Lord Lovat was de&s;troyed. The French pri&s;oners
were &s;ent to Carli&s;le and Penrith: Kilmarnock, Balmeri|no,
Cromartie, and his &s;on, the Lord Macleod, were con|veyed
by &s;ea to London; and tho&s;e of an inferior rank were
confined in different pri&s;ons. The Marquis of Tullibar|dine,
together with a brother of the Earl of Dunmore,
were &s;ei&s;ed, and tran&s;ported to the Tower of London, to
which the Earl of Tranquair had been committed on &s;u&s;pi|cion:
in a few months after the battle of Culloden, Murray,
the Pretender's &s;ecretary, was apprehended: and the elde&s;t
&s;on of Lord Lovat, having &s;urrendered him&s;elf, was impri|&s;oned
in the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh. In a word, all the jails
of Great-Britain, from the capital northwards, were filled
with tho&s;e unfortunate captives; and great numbers of
them were crowded together in the holds of &s;hips, where
they peri&s;hed in the mo&s;t deplorable manner, for want of
nece&s;&s;aries, air, and exerci&s;e. Some rebel chiefs e&s;caped
in two French frigates which had arrived on the coa&s;t of
<PB N="170" REF="176">
Lochaber about the end of April, and engaged three
ve&s;&s;els belonging to his Britannick Maje&s;ty, which they
obliged to retire. Others embarked on board of a &s;hip
on the coa&s;t of Buchan; and were conveyed to Norway,
from whence they travelled to Sweden. In the month
of May, the Duke of Cumberland advanced with the
army into the Highlands, as far as Fort-Augu&s;tus, where
he encamped; and &s;ent off detachments on all hands, to
hunt down the fugitives, and lay wa&s;te the country with
fire and &s;word. The ca&s;tles of Glengary and Lochiel
were plundered and burned: every hou&s;e, hut, or habi|tation,
met with the &s;ame fate, without di&s;tinction: all
the cattle and provi&s;ion were carried off: the men were
either &s;hot upon the mountains, like wild bea&s;ts, or pu$
to death in cold blood, without form of trial: the wo|men,
after having &s;een their hu&s;bands and fathers mur|dered,
were &s;ubjected to brutal violation, and then turne$
out naked, with their children, to &s;tarve on the barre$
heaths. One whole family was enclo&s;ed in a barn, an$
con&s;umed to a&s;hes. Tho&s;e mini&s;ters of vengeance we$$
&s;o alert in the execution of their office, that in a few
days there was neither hou&s;e, cottage, man, nor bea&s;t
to be &s;een in the compa&s;s of fifty miles: all was ruin
&s;ilence, and de&s;olation.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The humane reader cannot reflect upon &s;uch$word$
&s;cene without grief and horror: what then mu&s;t have
been the &s;en&s;ation of the fugitive prince, when he beheld
the&s;e &s;pectacles of woe, the di&s;mal fruit of his ambition&punc;
He was now &s;urrounded by armed troops, that cha&s;e$
him from hill to dale, from rock to cavern, and from
&s;hore to &s;hore. Sometimes he lurked in caves and cottages
without attendants, or any other &s;upport but that which the
poore&s;t pea&s;ant could &s;upply. Sometimes he was rowed i$
fi&s;her-boats from i&s;le to i&s;le, among the Hebrides, and often
in &s;ight of his pur&s;uers. For &s;ome days he appeared in
woman's attire, and even pa&s;&s;ed through the mid&s;t of his
enemies unknown. But, under&s;tanding his di&s;gui&s;e was
di&s;covered, he a&s;&s;umed the habit of a travelling moun|$$$neer,
<PB N="171" REF="177">
and wandered about among the woods and heaths,
$word$ a matted beard and &s;qualid looks, expo&s;ed to hun|ger,
thir&s;t, and wearine&s;s, and in continual danger of
$$$ng apprehended. He was obliged to tru&s;t his life to
$word$ fidelity of above fifty individuals, and many of the&s;e
$re in the lowe&s;t paths of fortune. They knew that a
$$ce of thirty thou&s;and pounds was &s;et upon his head;
$word$ that, by betraying him, they &s;hould enjoy wealth and
influence: but they dete&s;ted the thought of obtaining
$$hes on &s;uch infamous terms, and mini&s;tered to his ne|ce&s;&s;ities,
with the utmo&s;t zeal and fidelity, even at the
$$zard of their own de&s;truction. In the cour&s;e of the&s;e
$$regrinations, he was more than once hemmed in by his
$$r&s;uers, in &s;uch a manner as &s;eemed to preclude all po&s;&s;i|bility
of e&s;caping: yet, he was never abandoned by his
hope and recollection: he &s;till found &s;ome expedient that
$$ved him from captivity and death; and through the
$hole cour&s;e of his di&s;tre&s;&s;es maintained the mo&s;t ama|$$ng
equanimity and good humour. At length a privateer
$word$ St. Malo, hired by the young Sheridan and &s;ome other
$$i&s;h adherents, arrived in Lochanannach; and on the
twentieth day of September this unfortunate prince em|barked
in the habit which he wore for di&s;gui&s;e. His
$word$ was hollow, his vi&s;age wan, and his con&s;titution
$$ealty impaired by famine and fatigue. He was accom|$anied
by Cameron of Lochiel, and his brother, with a
$word$ other exiles. They &s;et &s;ail for France, and after
$aving pa&s;&s;ed un&s;een, by means of a thick fog, through
$word$ Briti&s;h &s;quadron commanded by Admiral Le&s;tock, and
$$een cha&s;ed by two Engli&s;h &s;hips of war, arrived in &s;afety
$word$ Ro&s;eau, near Morlaix, in Bretagne. Perhaps he would
$ave found it &s;till more difficult to e&s;cape, had not the
vigilance and eagerne&s;s of the government been relaxed,
$word$ con&s;equence of a report, that he had already fallen
among &s;ome per&s;ons that were &s;lain by a volley from one
of the Duke's detachments.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. Having thus explained the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and
extinction of the rebellion, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a
<PB N="172" REF="178">
retro&s;pective view of the proceedings in parliament. The
nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps being taken for quieting the inte&s;tine com|motions
of the kingdom, the two Hou&s;es began to con|vert
their attention to the affairs of the continent. On
the fourteenth day of January, the King repaired to
the Hou&s;e of Peers, and in a &s;peech from the throne
gave his parliament to under&s;tand, that the States-Gene|ral
had made pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the
pre&s;ent conjuncture, when they were in &s;uch danger of
being oppre&s;&s;ed by the power of France in the Nether|lands;
that he had promi&s;ed to co-operate with them
towards oppo&s;ing the further progre&s;s of their enemies;
and even concerted mea&s;ures for that purpo&s;e. He de|clared
it was with regret that he a&s;ked any further aids
of his people: he exhorted them to watch over the pub|lick
credit; and expre&s;&s;ed his entire dependence on their
zeal and unanimity. He was favoured with loyal ad|dre&s;&s;es,
couched in the warme&s;t terms of duty and af|fection:
but the &s;upplies were retarded by new convul|&s;ions
in the mini&s;try. The Earl of G. had made an effort
to retrieve his influence in the cabinet, and his &s;overeign
favoured his preten&s;ions. The two brothers, who knew
his a&s;piring genius, and dreaded his &s;uperior talents,
refu&s;ed to admit &s;uch a colleague into the admini&s;tration:
they even re&s;olved to &s;trengthen their party, by intro|ducing
fre&s;h auxiliaries into the offices of &s;tate. Some of
the&s;e were per&s;onally di&s;agreeable to his Maje&s;ty, who
accordingly rejected the &s;uit by which they were recom|mended.
The Duke of Newca&s;tle and his brother, with
all their adherents, immediately re&s;igned their employ|ments.
The Earl of Granville was appointed &s;ecretary
of &s;tate, and re&s;umed the reins of admini&s;tration: but,
finding him&s;elf unequal to the accumulated oppo&s;ition
that preponderated again&s;t him; fore&s;eeing that he &s;hould
not be able to &s;ecure the &s;upplies in parliament; and
dreading the con&s;equences of that confu&s;ion which his
re&s;toration had already produced, he, in three days, vo|luntarily
quitted the helm: and his Maje&s;ty acquie&s;ced
<PB N="173" REF="179">
in the mea&s;ures propo&s;ed by the oppo&s;ite party. The
&s;eals were re-delivered to the Duke of Newca&s;tle and the
Earl of Harrington: Mr. Pelham, and all the re&s;t who
had re&s;igned, were rein&s;tated in their re&s;petive employ|ments;
and offices were conferred on &s;everal individuals
who had never before been in the &s;ervice of the govern|ment.
William Pitt, E&s;q. was appointed vice-trea&s;urer
of Ireland, and &s;oon promoted to the place of payma&s;ter-general
of the forces; at the &s;ame time the King de|clared
him a privy-coun&s;ellor. This gentleman had been
originally de&s;igned for the army, in which he actually
bore a commi&s;&s;ion; but fate re&s;erved him for a more im|portant
&s;tation. In point of fortune he was barely quali|fied
to be elected member of parliament, when he obtain|ed
a &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Commons, where he &s;oon out|&s;hone
all his compatriots. He di&s;played a &s;urpri&s;ing ex|tent
and preci&s;ion of political knowledge, an irre&s;i&s;tible
energy of argument, and &s;uch powers of elocution, as
&s;truck his hearers with a&s;toni&s;hment and admiration. It
fla&s;hed like the lightning of heaven again&s;t the mini&s;ters
and &s;ons of corruption, bla&s;ting where it &s;mote, and wi|thering
the nerves of oppo&s;ition: but his more &s;ub&s;tantial
prai&s;e was founded upon his di&s;intere&s;ted integrity, his
incorruptible heart, his unconquerable &s;pirit of indepen|dence,
and his invariable attachment to the intere&s;t and
liberty of his country.</P>
<P>&sect; V. The quiet of the mini&s;try being re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, the
Hou&s;e of Commons provided for forty thou&s;and &s;eamen,
$early the &s;ame number of land forces, be&s;ides fifteen regi|ments
rai&s;ed by the nobility, on account of the rebellion,
and about twelve thou&s;and marines. They &s;ettled funds for
$he maintenance of the Dutch and He&s;&s;ian troops that
were in England, as well as for the &s;ub&s;idy to the Land-$$rave.
They granted three hundred thou&s;and pounds to
$word$ King of Sardinia; four hundred thou&s;and pounds to
$word$ Queen of Hungary; three hundred and ten thou&s;and
pounds to defray the expen&s;e of eighteen thou&s;and Ha|$$overians;
about three-and-thirty thou&s;and pounds in &s;ub|&s;idies
<PB N="174" REF="180">
to the Electors of Mentz and Cologn; and five
hundred thou&s;and pounds in a vote of credit and confidence
to his Maje&s;ty. The whole charge of the current year
amounted to &s;even millions two hundred and fifty thou&s;and
pounds, which was rai&s;ed by the land and malt-taxes
annuities on the additional duties impo&s;ed on gla&s;s, and &s;pi|rituous
liquors, a lottery, a deduction from the &s;inking
fund, and exchequer bills, chargeable on the fir&s;t aids that
&s;hould be granted in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. The rebellion being quelled, the legi&s;lature re|&s;olved
to make examples of tho&s;e who had been concerne$
in di&s;turbing the peace of their country. In June an $word$
of attainder was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the principal per&s;ons who
had embarked in that de&s;parate undertaking; and cour$
were opened in different parts of England, for the trial
of the pri&s;oners. Seventeen per&s;ons who had bor'n ar$
in the rebel army were executed at Kennington-Common
in the neighbourhood of London, and &s;uffered with great
con&s;tancy under the dreadful tortures which their &s;en|tence
pre&s;cribed: nine were put to death, in the &s;ame
manner, at Carli&s;le; &s;ix at Brumpton, &s;even at Penrit$
and eleven at York: of the&s;e a con&s;iderable number we$$
gentlemen, and had acted as officers: about fifty had been
executed as de&s;erters in different parts of Scotland: eigh|ty-one
&s;uffered the pains of the law as traitors. A &s;e$
obtained pardons, aad a con&s;iderable number were tran&s;|ported
to the plantations. Bills of indictment for high$
trea&s;on were found by the county of Surry again&s;t the
Earls of Kilmarnock and Cromartie, and Lord Balm$$rino.
The&s;e noblemen were tried by their peers in We&s;$$min&s;ter
hall, the Lord Chancellor pre&s;iding as Lo$$
High-Steward for the occa&s;ion. The two Earls confe&s;&s;e$
their crimes and in pathetick &s;peeches recommend$$$
them&s;elves to his Maje&s;ty's mercy. Lord Balmeri$$$
pleaded not guilty: he denied his having been at Caro|li&s;le
at the time &s;pecified in the indictment, but this e$$ception
was over-ruled: then he moved a point of law $word$
arre&s;t of judgment, and was allowed to be heard by $word$
<PB N="175" REF="181">
coun&s;el. They might have expatiated on the hard&s;hip
of being tried by an <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law, and claimed the
privilege of trial in the county where the act of trea&s;on
was &s;aid to have been committed. The &s;ame hard&s;hip
was impo&s;ed upon all the impri&s;oned rebels: they were
dragged in captivity to a &s;trange country, far from their
friends and connexions, de&s;titute of means to produce
evidence in their favour, even if they had been innocent
of the charge. Balmerino waved this plea, and &s;ubmitted
to the court, which pronounced &s;entence of death upon
him and his two a&s;&s;ociates. Cromartie's life was &s;pared,
but the other two were beheaded, in the month of Au|$u&s;t,
on Tower-hill. Kilmarnock was a nobleman of
$$ne per&s;onal accompli&s;hments: he had been educated in
Revolution principles, and engaged in the rebellion, partly
from the de&s;perate &s;ituation of his fortune, and partly from
$e&s;entment to the government, on his being deprived of a
$en&s;ion which he had for &s;ome time enjoyed. He was
$onvinced of his having acted criminally, and died with
$$arks of penitence and contrition. Balmerino had been
$red to arms, and acted upon principle: he was gallant,
$rave, rough, and re&s;olute: he eyed the implement of
$eath with the mo&s;t carele&s;s familiarity, and &s;eemed to
$riumph in his &s;ufferings. In November, Mr. Ratcliff,
$he titular Earl of Derwentwater, who had been taken
$word$ a &s;hip bound to Scotland, was arraigned on a former
$entence, pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him in the year one thou&s;and
even hundred and &s;ixteen: he refu&s;ed to acknowledge the
authority of the court, and pleaded that he was a &s;ubject of
France, honoured with a commi&s;&s;ion in the &s;ervice of his
Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty. The identity of his per&s;on be|ing
proved, a rule was made for his execution; and on
the eighth day of December he &s;uffered decapitation, with
the mo&s;t perfect compo&s;ure and &s;erenity. Lord Lovat,
$ow turned of four&s;core, was impeached by the Com|mons,
and tried in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall before the Lord

again&s;t him, he was convicted of high-trea&s;on, and con|demned.
Notwith&s;tanding his age, infirmities, and the
recollection of his con&s;cience, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be
not altogether void of offence, he died like an old Roman,
exclaiming, &startq;<HI>dulce et decorum pro patria mori.</HI>&endq; He
&s;urveyed the crowd with attention, examined the ax,
je&s;ted with the executioner, and laid his head upon the
block with the utmo&s;t indifference. From this la&s;t &s;cene
of his life one would have concluded, that he had approved
him&s;elf a patriot from his youth, and never deviated from
the paths of virtue.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The flame of war on the continent did not
expire at the election of an emperor, and the re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of peace among the princes of the empire.
On the contrary, it raged with double violence in con&s;e|quence
of the&s;e events; for the force that was before di|vided
being now united in one body, exerted it&s;elf with
greater vigour and rapidity. The States-General were
overwhelmed with con&s;ternation. Notwith&s;tanding the
pains they had taken to avoid a war, and the conde&s;cen&s;ion
with which they had &s;oothed and &s;upplicated the French
Monarch in repeated emba&s;&s;ies and memorials, they &s;aw
them&s;elves &s;tripped of their barrier, and once more in dan|ger
of being overwhelmed by that ambitious nation. The
city of Bru&s;&s;els had been reduced during the winter; &s;o
that the enemy were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Au&s;trian Ne|therlands,
except a few fortre&s;&s;es. Great part of the
forces belonging to the Republick were re&s;tricted from ac|tion
by capitulations, to which they had &s;ub&s;cribed. The
&s;tates were divided in their councils between the two fac|tions
which had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. They trembled at the
pro&s;pect of &s;eeing Zealand invaded in the &s;pring. The
Orange party loudly called for an augmentation of their
forces by &s;ea and land, that they might pro&s;ecute the war
with vigour. The common people, fond of novelty, daz|zled
by the &s;plendor of greatne&s;s, and fully per&s;uaded that
nothing but a chief was wanting to their &s;ecurity, demand|ed
the Prince of Orange as a Stadtholder; and even
<PB N="177" REF="183">
mingled menaces with their demands. The oppo&s;ite fac|tion
dreaded alike the power of a Stadtholder, the neigh|bourhood
of a French army, and the &s;editious di&s;po&s;ition of
the populace. An amba&s;&s;ador was &s;ent to London with
repre&s;entations of the imminent dangers which threatened
the republick; and he was ordered to &s;ollicit in the mo&s;t
pre&s;&s;ing terms the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Britannic Maje&s;ty, that
the allies might have a &s;uperiority in the Netherlands by
the beginning of the campaign. The King was very well
di&s;po&s;ed to comply with their reque&s;t; but the rebellion in
his kingdom, and the di&s;&s;entions in his cabinet, had retard|ed
the &s;upplies, and embarra&s;&s;ed him &s;o much, that he
found it impo&s;&s;ible to make tho&s;e early preparations that
were nece&s;&s;ary to check the career of the enemy.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The King of France, with his general, the
Count de Saxe, took the field in the latter end of April, at
the head of one hundred and twenty thou&s;and men, and
advanced towards the allies, who, to the number of four-and-forty
thou&s;and, were entrenched behind the Demer,
under the conduct of the Au&s;trian general Bathiani, who
retired before them, and took po&s;t in the neighbourhood of
Breda, the capital of Dutch Brabant. Mare&s;chal Saxe im|mediately
inve&s;ted Antwerp, which in a few days was &s;ur|rendered.
Then he appeared before the &s;trong town of
Mons in Hainault, with an irre&s;i&s;tible train of artillery, an
immen&s;e quantity of bombs and warlike implements. He
carried on his approaches with &s;uch unabating impetuou&s;ity,
that, notwith&s;tanding a very vigorous defence, the garri&s;on
was obliged to capitulate on the twenty-&s;eventh day of
June, in about eight-and-twenty days after the place had
been inve&s;ted. Sieges were not now carried on by the te|dious
method of &s;apping. The French King found it
much more expeditious and effectual to bring into the field
a prodigious train of battering cannon, and enormous mor|tars,
that kept up &s;uch a fire as no garri&s;on could &s;u&s;tain,
and di&s;charge &s;uch an ince&s;&s;ant hail of bombs and bullets,
as in a very little time reduced to ruins the place, with all
its fortifications. St. Gui&s;lain and Charleroy met with
<PB N="178" REF="184">
the fate of Mons and Antwerp; &s;o that by the middle of
July the French King was ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of Flanders,
Brabant, and Hainault.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. Prince Charles of Lorraine had by this time a&s;|&s;umed
the command of the confederate army at Terheyde,
which being re-enforced by the He&s;&s;ian troops from Scot|land,
and a fre&s;h body of the Au&s;trians under Count Pal$i,
amounted to eighty-&s;even thou&s;and men, including the
Dutch forces commanded by the Prince of Waldeck. The
generals, &s;uppo&s;ing the next &s;torm would fall upon Na|mur,
marched towards that place, and took po&s;t in an ad|vantageous
&s;ituation on the eighteenth day of July, in &s;ight
of the French army, which was encamped at Gemblours.
Here they remained till the eighth day of Augu&s;t, when a
detachment of the enemy, commanded by Count Lowen|dahl,
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Huy, where he found a large maga|zine
belonging to the confederates; and their communica|tion
with Mae&s;tricht was cut off. Mare&s;chal Saxe, on the
other &s;ide, took his mea&s;ures &s;o well, that they were utterly
deprived of all &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Then Prince Charles, retiring
acro&s;s the Mae&s;e, abandoned Namur to the efforts of the
enemy, by whom it was immediately inve&s;ted. The
trenches were opened on the &s;econd day of September; and
the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even thou&s;and Au&s;trians, de|fended
them&s;elves with equal &s;kill and re&s;olution: but the
cannonading and bombardment were &s;o terrible, that in
a few days the place was converted into a heap of rubbi&s;h;
and on the twenty-third day of the month the French mo|narch
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this &s;trong fortre&s;s, which had for|merly
&s;u&s;tained &s;uch dreadful attacks. Mean while the al|lied
army encamped at Mae&s;tricht were joined by Sir John
Ligonier, with &s;ome Briti&s;h and Bavarian battalions; and
Prince Charles re&s;olved to give the enemy battle. With
this view he pa&s;&s;ed the Mae&s;e on the thirteenth day of Sep|tember,
and advanced towards Mare&s;chal Saxe, whom he
found &s;o advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted at Tongres, that he thought
proper to march back to Mae&s;tricht. On the twenty-&s;ixth
day of September he cro&s;&s;ed the Jaar in his retreat;
<PB N="179" REF="185">
and his rear was attacked by the enemy, who were re|$$l&s;ed.
But Count Saxe being re-enforced by a body of
$$oops, under the Count de Clermont, determined to bring
$word$ confederates to an engagement. On the thirteenth
day of the month he pa&s;&s;ed the Jaar, while they took po&s;|$e&s;&s;ion
of the villages of Liers, Warem, and Roucoux,
$rew up their forces in order of battle, and made prepara|tions
for giving him a warm reception. On the fir&s;t day of
October the enemy advanced in three columns; and a ter|$$ble
cannonading began about noon. At two o'clock Prince
$aldeck on the left was charged with great fury; and
$$ter an ob&s;tinate defence overpowered by numbers.
$he villages were attacked in columns, and as one bri|$ade
was repul&s;ed another &s;ucceeded; &s;o that the allies
were obliged to abandon the&s;e po&s;ts, and retreat towards
Mae&s;tricht, with the lo&s;s of five thou&s;and men, and thirty
$ieces of artillery. The victory, however, co&s;t the French
general a much greater number of lives; and was attended
with no &s;olid advantage. Sir John Ligonier, the Earls of
$rawford<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This nobleman, &s;o remarkable for his courage and thir&s;t of glory, ex|$$ited a very extraordinary in&s;tance of pre&s;ence of mind on the morning it preceded this battle. He and &s;ome volunteers, accompanied by his ai|du-camp, and attended by two orderly dragoons, had rode out before $word$ to reconnoitre the &s;ituation of the enemy; and fell in upon one of $word$ advanced guards. The &s;erjeant who commanded it immediately turn|out his men, and their pieces were pre&s;ented when the earl fir&s;t per|$ved them. Without betraying the lea&s;t mark of di&s;order, he rode up to &s;erjeant, and a&s;&s;uming the character of a French general, told him in it language, that there was no occa&s;ion for &s;uch ceremony. Then he a&s;k-$$if they had perceived any of the enemy's parties? and being an&s;wered the negative, &startq;Very well (&s;aid he) be upon your guard; and if you $hould be attacked, I will take care that you &s;hall be &s;u&s;tained.&endq; So &s;ay-$word$ he and his company retired before the &s;erjeant could recollect him&s;elf in the &s;urprize occa&s;ioned by this unexpected addre&s;s. In all probability was &s;oon &s;en&s;ible of his mi&s;take; for the incident was that very day $$blickly mentioned in the French army. The Prince of Tingray, an offi|$$$ in the Au&s;trian &s;ervice, having been taken pri&s;oner in the battle that $ued, dined with Mare&s;chal Count Saxe, who di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him on his pa|$$e. and de&s;ired he would charge him&s;elf with a facetious compliment to old friend, the Earl of Crawford. He wi&s;hed his lord&s;hip joy of being French general, and &s;aid he could not help being di&s;plea&s;ed with the
$$$jeant, as he had not procured him the honour of his lord&s;hip's company dinner.</NOTE> and Rothes, Brigadier Douglas, and other of|ficers
<PB N="180" REF="186">
of the Briti&s;h troops, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by
their gallantry and conduct on this occa&s;ion. This action
terminated the campaign. The allies pa&s;&s;ing the Mae&s;e,
took up their winter quarters in the duchies of Limburgh
and Luxembourgh; while the French cantoned their
troops in the places which they had newly conquered.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The campaign in Italy was altogether unfavour|able
to the French and Spaniards. The hou&s;e of Au&s;tria$
being no longer pre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ide of Germany, was ena|bled
to make the &s;tronger efforts in this country; and the
Briti&s;h &s;ub&s;idy encouraged the King of Sardinia to $word$
with redoubled vivacity. Mare&s;chal Maillebois occupie$
the greater part of Piedomont with about thirty thou&s;and
men. Don Philip and the Count de Gages were at the
head of a greater number in the neighbourhood of Milan$$
and the Duke of Modena, with eight thou&s;and, &s;ecure$
his own dominions. The King of Sardinia augmented his
forces to &s;ix-and-thirty thou&s;and; and the Au&s;trian army
under the Prince of Lichten&s;tein, amounted to a much
greater number; &s;o that the enemy were reduced to the
nece&s;&s;ity of acting on the defen&s;ive, and retired towards the
Mantuan. In February Baron Leutrum, the Piedmo$$
te&s;e general, inve&s;ted and took the &s;trong fortre&s;s of A&s;&s;$$.
He afterwards relieved the citadel of Alexandria, which
the Spaniards had blocked up in the winter, reduced Ca&s;a$
recovered Valencia, and obliged Maillebois to retire $word$
neighbourhood of Genoa. On the other &s;ide, Don Phil$$
and Count Gages abandoned Milan, Pavia, and Parm$
retreating before the Au&s;trians with the utmo&s;t precipita|tion
to Placentia, where they were joined on the third
June by the French forces under Maillebois.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. Before this junction was effected, the Spani&s;h gene|ral,
Pignatelli, had pa&s;&s;ed the river Po in the night with
&s;trong detachment, and beaten up the quarters of &s;eve$$
thou&s;and Au&s;trians po&s;ted at Codogno. Don Philip, find|ing
him&s;elf at the head of two-and-fifty thou&s;and men
his junction with the French general, re&s;olved to attack$$
Au&s;trians in their camp at San Lazaro, before they $word$
<PB N="181" REF="187">
re-enforced by his Sardinian Maje&s;ty. Accordingly, on
the fourth day of June in the evening, he marched with
$qual &s;ilence and expedition, and entered the Au&s;trian
$renches about eleven, when a de&s;perate battle en&s;ued.
The Au&s;trians were prepared for the attack, which they
&s;u&s;tained with great vigour till morning. Then they
$uitted their entrenchments, and charged the enemy in
their turn with &s;uch fury, that after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance
the combined army was broke, and retired with precipita|tion
to Placentia, leaving on the field fifteen thou&s;and men
$tilled, wounded, and taken, together with &s;ixty colours,
and ten pieces of artillery. In a few weeks the Au&s;trians
were joined by the Piedmonte&s;e: the King of Sardinia a&s;|&s;umed
the chief command; and Prince Lichten&s;tein being
$$ndi&s;po&s;ed, his place was &s;upplied by the Marquis de Botta.
Don Philip retired to the other &s;ide of the Po, and extend|ded
his conque&s;ts in the open country of the Milane&s;e.
The King of Sardinia called a council of war, in which
$t was determined that he &s;hould pa&s;s the river with a
&s;trong body of troops, in order to &s;traighten the enemy on
one &s;ide; while the Marquis de Botta &s;hould march up
the Tydone, to cut off their communication with Placen|$ia.
They forthwith quitted all the po&s;ts they had occu|pied
between the Lambro and Adda, re&s;olving to repa&s;s the
Po, and retreat to Tortona. With this view they threw
$ridges of boats over that river, and began to pa&s;s on the
ninth day of Augu&s;t in the evening. They were attacked
at Rotto Freddo by a detachment of Au&s;trians, under Ge|neral
Serbelloni, who maintained the engagement till ten
in the morning, when Botta arrived: the battle was re|$$ewed
with redoubled rage, and la&s;ted till four in the after|noon,
when the enemy retired in great di&s;order to Tortona,
with the lo&s;s of eight thou&s;and men, a good number of co|$ours
and &s;tandards, and eighteen pieces of cannon. This
victory co&s;t the Au&s;trians four thou&s;and men killed upon
the &s;pot, including the gallant General Bernclau. The
$$ctors immediately &s;ummoned Placentia to &s;urrender; and
the garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of nine thou&s;and men, were made
<PB N="182" REF="188">
pri&s;oners of war: Don Philip continued his retreat, and
of all his forces brought &s;ix-and-twenty thou&s;and only into
the territories of Genoa.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. The Piedmonte&s;e and Au&s;trians rejoining in
the neighbourhood of Pavia, advanced to Tortona, of
which they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without re&s;i&s;tance, while the
enemy &s;heltered them&s;elves under the cannon of Genoa.
They did not long continue in this &s;ituation: for on the
twenty-&s;econd day of Augu&s;t they were again in motion,
and retired into Provence. The court of Madrid im|puting
the bad &s;ucce&s;s of this campaign to the mi&s;con|duct
of Count Gages, recalled that general, and &s;ent the
Marquis de las Minas to re&s;ume the command of the forces.
In the mean time, the victorious confederates appeared be|fore
Genoa on the fourth day of December: and the &s;e|nate
of that city thinking it incapable of defence, &s;ubmit|ted
to a very mortifying capitulation, by which the gates
were delivered up to the Au&s;trians, together with all their
arms, artillery, and ammunition: and the city was &s;ub|jected
to the mo&s;t cruel contributions. The Marquis
de Botta being left at Genoa with &s;ixteen thou|&s;and
men, the King of Sardinia re&s;olved to pa&s;s the Va$,
and pur&s;ue the French and Spaniards into Provence: but,
that monarch being &s;ei&s;ed with the &s;mall-pox, the con|duct
of this expedition was entru&s;ted to Count Brown, an
Au&s;trian general of Iri&s;h extract, who had given repeated
proofs of uncommon valour and capacity. He was on this
occa&s;ion a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Vice-Admiral Medley, who command|ed
the Briti&s;h &s;quadron in the Mediterranean. The French
forces had fortified the pa&s;&s;es of the Var, under the con|duct
of the Mare&s;chal de Bellei&s;le, who thought proper to
abandon his po&s;ts at the approach of Count Brown; and
this general, at the head of fifty thou&s;and men, pa&s;&s;ed the
river without oppo&s;ition, on the ninth day of November.
While he advanced as far as Draguignan, laying the open
country under contribution, Baron Roth, with four-and-twenty
battalions, inve&s;ted Antibes, which was at the
&s;ame time bombarded on the &s;ide of the &s;ea by the Briti&s;h
<PB N="183" REF="189">
&s;quadron. The trenches were opened on the twentieth
day of September: but Bellei&s;le having a&s;&s;embled a nume|rous
army, &s;uperior to that of the confederates, and the Ge|noe&s;e
having expelled their Au&s;trian gue&s;ts, Count Brown
abandoned the enterpri&s;e, and repa&s;&s;ed the Var, not with|out
&s;ome damage from the enemy.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. The court of Vienna, which has always pa|troni&s;ed
oppre&s;&s;ion, exacted &s;uch heavy contributions from
the Genoe&s;e, and its directions were &s;o rigorou&s;ly put in
execution, that the people were reduced to de&s;pair; and
re&s;olved to make a la&s;t effort for the recovery of their li|berty
and independence. Accordingly, they took arms in
&s;ecret, &s;ei&s;ed &s;everal important po&s;ts of the city; &s;ur|pri&s;ed
&s;ome battalions of the Au&s;trians; &s;urrounded others,
and cut them in pieces; and, in a word, drove them out
with great &s;laughter. The Marquis de Botta acted with
caution and &s;pirit: but being overpowered by numbers,
and apprehen&s;ive of the pea&s;ants in the country, who were
in arms, he retreated to the pa&s;s of the Bochetta on the &s;ide
of Lombardy, where he &s;ecured him&s;elf in an advantageous
&s;ituation, until he could receive re-enforcements. The lo&s;s
he had &s;u&s;tained at Genoa did not hinder him from re|ducing
Savona, a &s;ea port town belonging to that republick;
and he afterwards made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Gavi. The
Genoe&s;e, on the contrary, exerted them&s;elves with won|derful
indu&s;try in fortifying their city, rai&s;ing troops, and
in taking other mea&s;ures for a vigorous defence, in ca&s;e
they &s;hould again be in&s;ulted.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The naval tran&s;actions of this year reflected
very little honour on the Briti&s;h nation. Commodore
Peyton, who commanded &s;ix &s;hips of war in the Ea&s;t-In|dies,
&s;hamefully declined a deci&s;ive engagement with a
French &s;quadron of inferior force: and abandoned the im|portant
&s;ettlement of Madras on the coa&s;t of Coromandel,
which was taken without oppo&s;ition in the month of Sep|tember
by the French commodore, De la Bourdonnais.
$ort St. David, and the other Briti&s;h factories in India,
would probably have &s;hared the &s;ame fate, had not the
<PB N="184" REF="190">
enemy's naval force in that country been &s;hattered and
partly de&s;troyed by a terrible tempe&s;t. No event of con&s;e|quence
happened in America, though it was a &s;cene that
&s;eemed to promi&s;e the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s to the arms of Eng|land.
The reduction of Cape-Breton had encouraged the
mini&s;try to project the conque&s;t of Quebeck, the capital of
Canada, &s;ituated upon the river of St. Laurence. Com|mi&s;&s;ions
were &s;ent to the governors of the Briti&s;h colonies
in North-America, empowering them to rai&s;e companies
to join the armament from England; and eight thou&s;and
troops were actually rai&s;ed in con&s;equence of the&s;e direc|tions;
while a powerful &s;quadron and tran&s;ports, having
&s;ix regiments on board, were prepared at Port&s;mouth for
this expedition. But their departure was po&s;tponed by
unaccountable delays, until the &s;ea&s;on was judged too far
advanced to ri&s;que the great &s;hips on the boi&s;terous coa&s;t of
North-America. That the armament, however, might
not be wholly u&s;ele&s;s to the nation, it was employed in
making a de&s;cent upon the coa&s;t of Bretagne, on the &s;up|po&s;ition
that Port L'Orient, the repo&s;itory of all the &s;tores
and &s;hips belonging to the French Ea&s;t-India company,
might be &s;urpri&s;ed; or, that this inva&s;ion would alarm
the enemy, and, by making a diver&s;ion, facilitate the
operations of the Au&s;trian general in Provence.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. The naval force intended for this &s;ervice con|&s;i&s;ted
of &s;ixteen great &s;hips, and eight frigates, be&s;ides
bomb-ketches and &s;tore-&s;hips, commanded by Richard
Le&s;tock, appointed admiral of the blue divi&s;ion. Six bat|talions
of land troops, with a detachment of matro&s;&s;es and
bombardiers, were embarked in thirty tran&s;ports, under the
conduct of Lieutenant General Sinclair; and the whole
fleet &s;et &s;ail from Plymouth on the fourteenth day of Sep|tember.
On the twentieth the troops were landed in Quim|perlay-bay,
at the di&s;tance of ten miles from Port
L'Orient. The militia, re-enforced by &s;ome detachments
from different regiments, were a&s;&s;embled to the number of
two thou&s;and, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to oppo&s;e the di&s;em|barkation:
but, &s;eeing the Briti&s;h troops determined to
<PB N="185" REF="191">
and at all events, they thought proper to retire. Next
$ay General Sinclair advanced into the country, &s;kirmi&s;h|ing
with the enemy in his route; and arriving at the vil|$age
of Plemure, within half a league from Port L'Orient,
&s;ummoned that place to &s;urrender. He was vi&s;ited by a
reputation from the town, which offered to admit the Bri|ti&s;h
forces, on condition that they &s;hould be re&s;trained
from pillaging the inhabitants, and touching the maga|zines;
and that they &s;hould pay a ju&s;t price for their pro|$$&s;ions.
The&s;e terms being rejected, the inhabitants pre|pared
for a vigorous defence; and the Engli&s;h general re|&s;olved
to be&s;iege the place in form, though he had neither
time, artillery, nor forces &s;ufficient for &s;uch an enterpri&s;e.
This &s;trange re&s;olution was owing to the declaration of the
engineers, who promi&s;ed to lay the place in a&s;hes in the &s;pace
of four-and-twenty hours. All his cannon amounted to
no more than a few field-pieces; and he was obliged to
wait for two iron guns, which the &s;ailors dragged up from
the &s;hipping. Had he given the a&s;&s;ault on the fir&s;t night
after his arrival, when the town was filled with terror and
confu&s;ion, and de&s;titute of regular troops, in all probability
it would have been ea&s;ily taken by &s;calade: but the reduc|tion
of it was rendered impracticable by his delay. The
ramparts were mounted with cannon from the &s;hips in the
harbour: new works were rai&s;ed with great indu&s;try: the
garri&s;on was re-enforced by &s;everal bodies of regular troops:
and great numbers were a&s;&s;embling from all parts; &s;o that
the Briti&s;h forces were in danger of being &s;urrounded in
an enemy's country. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;courage|ments,
they opened a &s;mall battery again&s;t the town,
which was &s;et on fire in &s;everal places by their bombs and

the &s;hips on an open coa&s;t at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on of the year,

General Sinclair abandoned the &s;iege. Having cau&s;ed the
two iron pieces of cannon and the mortars to be &s;piked, he
retreated in good order to the &s;ea-&s;ide, where his troops
were re-embarked, having &s;u&s;tained very incon&s;iderable
damage &s;ince their fir&s;t landing. He expected re-enforce|ments
from England, and was re&s;olved to wait a little lon|ger
for their arrival, in hopes of being able to annoy the
enemy more effectually. In the beginning of October the
fleet &s;ailed to Quiberon-Bay, where they de&s;troyed the Ar|dent,
a French &s;hip of war of &s;ixty-four guns; and a de|tachment
of the forces being landed, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a
fort on the penin&s;ula; while the little i&s;lands of Houat and
Heydic were reduced by the failors. In this &s;ituation the
admiral and general continued till the &s;eventeenth day of
the month, when the forts being di&s;mantled, and the troops
re-embarked, the fleet &s;ailed from the French coa&s;t: the
admiral returned to England, and the tran&s;ports with the
&s;oldiers proceeded to Ireland, where they arrived in &s;afety.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. This expedition, weak and frivolous as it may
&s;eem, was re&s;ented by the French nation as one of the
greate&s;t in&s;ults they had ever &s;u&s;tained; and demon&s;trated
the po&s;&s;ibility of hurting France in her tendere&s;t parts, by
means of an armament of this nature, well-timed, and vi|gorou&s;ly
conducted. Indeed, nothing could be more ab|&s;urd
or precipitate than an attempt to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy
by landing a handful of troops, without draft-hor&s;es,
tents, or artillery, from a fleet of &s;hips lying on an open
beach, expo&s;ed to the uncertainty of weather in the mo&s;t
tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;on of the year, &s;o as to render the retreat
and re-embarkation altogether precarious. The Briti&s;h
&s;quadrons in the We&s;t-Indies performed no exploit of con|&s;equence
in the cour&s;e of this year. The commerce was
but indifferently protected. Commodore Lee, &s;tationed off
Martinico, allowed a French fleet of merchant-&s;hips, and
their convoy, to pa&s;s by his &s;quadron unmole&s;ted; and
Commodore Mitchell behaved &s;candalou&s;ly in a rencontre
with the French &s;quadron, under the conduct of Mon&s;ieur
de Con&s;tans, who in his return to Europe took the Severn,
<PB N="187" REF="193">
an Engli&s;h &s;hip of fifty guns. The crui&s;ers on all &s;ides,
Engli&s;h, French, and Spaniards, were extremely alert; and
though the Engli&s;h lo&s;t the greater number of &s;hips, this
difference was more than overbalanced by the &s;uperior
value of the prizes taken from the enemy. In the cour&s;e of
this year two-and-twenty Spani&s;h privateers, and &s;ixty-&s;ix
merchant ve&s;&s;els, including ten regi&s;ter &s;hips, fell into the
hands of the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers: from the French<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the month of July, Philip V.

&s;even &s;hips of war, ninety privateers, and about three hun|dred
&s;hips of commerce. The new King of Spain being
&s;uppo&s;ed well affected to the Briti&s;h nation, an effort was
made to detach him from the intere&s;ts of France, by means
of the Marquis de Tabernega, who had formerly been his
favourite, and re&s;ided many years as a refugee in England.
This nobleman proceeded to Li&s;bon, where a negociation
was &s;et on foot with the court of Madrid. But his efforts
mi&s;carried; and the influence of the queen mother conti|nued
to predominate in the Spani&s;h councils. The States-General
had for &s;ome years endeavoured to promote a paci|fication
by remon&s;trances, and even entreaties, at the court
of Ver&s;ailles: the French King at length di&s;covered an in|$ination
to peace, and in September a congre&s;s was
opened at Breda, the capital of Dutch Brabant, where the
$enipotentiaries of the Emperor, Great-Britain, France,
and Holland were a&s;&s;embled: but the French were &s;o
$$&s;olent in their demands, that the conferences were &s;oon
interrupted.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The parliament of Great-Britain meeting in
November, the King exhorted them to concert with all
po&s;&s;ible expedition the proper mea&s;ures for pur&s;uing the war
with vigour, that the con&s;ederate army in the Netherlands
<PB N="188" REF="194">
might be &s;ea&s;onably augmented: he, likewi&s;e, gave them $word$
under&s;tand, that the funds appropriated for the &s;upport $word$
his civil government had for &s;ome years pa&s;t fallen &s;hort $word$
the revenue intended and granted by parliament; and &s;aid
he relied on their known affection to find out &s;ome method
to make good this deficiency. As all tho&s;e who ha$$
conducted the oppo&s;ition were now concerned in the
admini&s;tration, little or no objection was made to any
demand or propo&s;al of the government and its mini&s;ters.
The Commons having con&s;idered the e&s;timates, voted forty
thou&s;and &s;eamen for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, and
about &s;ixty thou&s;and land-forces, including eleven thou&s;and
five hundred marines. They granted four hundred and
thirty-three thou&s;and pounds to the Empre&s;s Queen of Hun|gary;
three hundred thou&s;and pounds to the King of Sar|dinia;
four hundred and ten thou&s;and pounds for the main|tenance
of eighteen thou&s;and Hanoverian auxiliaries; one
hundred and &s;ixty-one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;even
pounds, for &s;ix thou&s;and He&s;&s;ians; &s;ub&s;idies to the Elector
of Cologn, Mentz, and Bavaria; and the &s;um of five hun|dred
thou&s;and pounds to enable his Maje&s;ty to pro&s;ecut
the war with advantage. In a word, the &s;upplies amount|ed
to nine millions four hundred twenty-five thou&s;and
two hundred fifty-four pounds; a &s;um almo&s;t incredible
if we con&s;ider how the kingdom had been already drain$
of its trea&s;ure. It was rai&s;ed by the u&s;ual taxes, re-en|forced
with new impo&s;itions on windows, carriages, and
&s;pirituous liquors, a lottery, and a loan from the &s;inking
fund. The new taxes were mortgaged for four million
by transferable annuities, at an intere&s;t of four, and a pre|mium
of ten per centum. By reflecting on the&s;e enor|mous
grants, one would imagine the mini&s;try had been
determined to impoveri&s;h the nation: but, from the eager|ne&s;s
and expedition with which the people &s;ub&s;cribed $word$
the money, one would conclude that the riches of the
kingdom were inexhau&s;tible. It may not be ami&s;s to of
&s;erve, that the &s;upplies of this year exceeded, by two mi$|lions
and a half, the greate&s;t annual &s;um that was rai&s;e
<PB N="189" REF="195">
during the reign of Queen Anne, though &s;he maintained as
great a number of troops as was now in the pay of Great-Britain,
and her armies and fleets acquired every year fre&s;h
harve&s;ts of glory and advantage: whereas this war had
$$oved an almo&s;t uninterrupted &s;eries of events big with
di&s;a&s;ter and di&s;honour. During the la&s;t two years, the
$$aval expen&s;e of England had exceeded that of France
above five millions &s;terling; though her fleets had not
obtained one &s;ignal advantage over the enemy at &s;ea, nor
been able to protect her commerce from their depredations.
$he was at once a prey to her declared adver&s;aries and pro|$e&s;&s;ed
friends. Before the end of &s;ummer, &s;he numbered
among her mercenaries two empre&s;&s;es, five German
Princes, and a powerful monarch, whom &s;he hired to a&s;&s;i&s;t
her in trimming the balance of Europe, in which they
them&s;elves were immediately intere&s;ted, and &s;he had no
more than a &s;econdary concern. Had the&s;e fruitle&s;s &s;ub|$$dies
been &s;aved: had the national revenue been applied
with oeconomy to national purpo&s;es: had it been em|ployed
in liquidating gradually the publick incumbrances;
in augmenting the navy, improving manufactures, encou|raging
and &s;ecuring the colonies, and extending trade and
navigation, corruption would have become altogether un|nece&s;&s;ary,
and di&s;affection would have vani&s;hed: the
people would have been ea&s;ed of their burthens, and cea&s;ed
to complain: commerce would have flouri&s;hed, and pro|duced
&s;uch affluence as mu&s;t have rai&s;ed Great-Britain to
the highe&s;t pinnacle of maritime power, above all rival&s;hip
or competition. She would have been dreaded by her ene|mies;
revered by her neighbours: oppre&s;&s;ed nations
would have crept under her wings for protection; con|$ending
potentates would have appealed to her deci&s;ion;
and &s;he would have &s;hone the univer&s;al arbitre&s;s of Europe.
How different is her pre&s;ent &s;ituation! her debts are enor|mous,
her taxes intolerable, her people di&s;contented, and
the &s;inews of her government relaxed. Without con|duct,
confidence, or concert, &s;he engages in blundering
negociations: &s;he involves her&s;elf ra&s;hly in foreign
<PB N="190" REF="196">
quarrels, and lavi&s;hes her &s;ub&s;tance with the mo&s;t dan|gerous
precipitation: &s;he is even de&s;erted by her wonted
vigour, &s;teadine&s;s and intrepidity: &s;he grows vain, fan|ta&s;tical,
and pu&s;illanimous: her arms are de&s;pi&s;ed by
her enemies: and her councils ridiculed through all
Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The King, in order to exhibit a &s;pecimen
of his de&s;ire to dimini&s;h the publick expen&s;e, ordered the
third and fourth troops of his life-guards to be di&s;banded,
and reduced three regiments of hor&s;e to the quality of
dragoons. The Hou&s;e of Commons pre&s;ented an addre&s;s
of thanks for this in&s;tance of oeconomy, by which the
annual &s;um of &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds was &s;aved to the
nation. Notwith&s;tanding this &s;eeming harmony between
the King and the great council of the nation, his Ma|je&s;ty
re&s;olved, with the advice of his council, to di&s;&s;olve
the pre&s;ent parliament, though the term of &s;even years
was not yet expired &s;ince its fir&s;t meeting. The mini&s;try
affected to in&s;inuate, that the States-General were un|willing
to concur with his Maje&s;ty in vigorous mea&s;ures
again&s;t France, during the exi&s;tence of a parliament which
had undergone &s;uch a vici&s;&s;itude of complexion. The
allies of Great-Britain, far from being &s;u&s;picious of this
a&s;&s;embly, which had &s;upplied them &s;o liberally, &s;aw with
concern, that, according to law, it would &s;oon be di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed;
and they doubted whether another could be pro|cured
equally agreeable to their purpo&s;es. In order to re|move
this doubt, the mini&s;try re&s;olved to &s;urpri&s;e the
kingdom with a new election, before the malcontents
&s;hould be prepared to oppo&s;e the friends of the government
Accordingly, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ion was di|&s;patched,
the King having given the royal a&s;&s;ent to the
&s;everal acts they had prepared, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them in the
month of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. 1747.</NOTE> with an affectionate &s;peech, that breathed
nothing but tenderne&s;s and gratitude. The parliament
was immediately di&s;&s;olved by proclamation, and new writ$
were i&s;&s;ued for convoking another. Among the laws
pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was an act aboli&s;hing the heritable
<PB N="191" REF="197">
juri&s;dictions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX. 1747.</NOTE> and taking away the tenour of wardhold|ings
in Scotland, which were reckoned among the prin|cipal
&s;ources of tho&s;e rebellions that had been excited
$word$ the Revolution. In the Highlands they certainly
$word$ the common people in &s;ubjection to their chiefs,
$hom they implicitly followed and obeyed in all their
undertakings. By this act the&s;e mountaineers were le|$$lly
emancipated from &s;lavery: but as the tenants enjoyed
$word$ lea&s;es, and were at all times liable to be ejected from
their farms, they &s;till depended on the plea&s;ure of their
$$ds, notwith&s;tanding this interpo&s;ition of the legi&s;lature,
which granted a valuable con&s;ideration in money to every
nobleman and petty baron, who was thus deprived of one
$$rt of his inheritance. The forfeited e&s;tates, indeed,
were divided into &s;mall farms, and let by the government
$word$ lea&s;es at an under value; &s;o that tho&s;e who had the
$$od fortune to obtain &s;uch lea&s;es ta&s;ted the &s;weets of in|dependence:
but the Highlanders in general were left in
their original indigence and incapacity, at the mercy of
their &s;uperiors. Had manufactures and fi&s;heries been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
in different parts of their country, they would
have &s;een and felt the happy con&s;equences of indu&s;try,
$word$ in a little time been effectually detached from all their
$$vi&s;h connexions.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. The operations of the campaign had been con|$$rted
in the winter at the Hague, between the Duke of
Cumberland and the States-General of the United-Pro|vinces,
who were by this time generally convinced of
$$ance's de&s;ign to encroach upon their territories. They,
therefore, determined to take effectual mea&s;ures again&s;t
$$at re&s;tle&s;s and ambitious neighbour. The allied powers
agreed to a&s;&s;emble a va&s;t army in the Netherlands; and it
$word$ re&s;olved that the Au&s;trians and Piedmonte&s;e &s;hould
$word$ more penetrate into Provence. The Dutch patriots,
however, were not rou&s;ed into this exertion, until all
their remon&s;trances had &s;ailed at the court of Ver&s;ailles;
$$til they had been urged by repeated memorials of the
Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, and &s;timulated by the immediate
<PB N="192" REF="198">
danger to which their country was expo&s;ed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1747.</NOTE> for France
was by this time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the Au&s;trian Netherlands,
and &s;eemed bent upon penetrating into the territories of the
United Provinces. In February, the Duke of Cumber|land
began to a&s;&s;emble the allied forces; and in the latter
end of March they took the field in three &s;eparate bo|dies.
His royal highne&s;s, with the Engli&s;h, Hanoveriam,
and He&s;&s;ians, fixed his head-quarters at the village of Til|berg:
the Prince of Waldeck was po&s;ted with the Dutch
troops at Breda; and Mare&s;chal Bathiani collected the
Au&s;trians and Bavarians in the neighbourhood of Venlo.
The whole army amounted to one hundred and twenty
thou&s;and men, who lay inactive &s;ix weeks, expo&s;ed to the
inclemency of the weather, and almo&s;t de&s;titute of &s;orage
and provi&s;ion. Count Saxe, by this time created mare&s;|chal-general
of France, continued his troops within their
cantonments at Bruges, Antwerp, and Bru&s;&s;els, de|claring,
that when the allied army &s;hould be weakened
by &s;ickne&s;s and mortality, he would convince the Duke of
Cumberland, that the fir&s;t duty of a general is to pro|vide
for the health and pre&s;ervation of his troops. In
April this fortunate commander took the field, at the
head of one hundred and forty thou&s;and men; and the
Count de Clermont commanded a &s;eparate body of nine|teen
battalions and thirty &s;quadrons. Count Lowendah$
was detached on the &s;ixteenth day of the month, with
&s;even-and-twenty thou&s;and men, to invade Dutch Flan|ders:
at the &s;ame time, the French mini&s;ter at the Hagu$
pre&s;ented a memorial to the States, intimating, that his
ma&s;ter was obliged to take this &s;tep by the nece&s;&s;ity of
war: but that his troops &s;hould ob&s;erve the &s;ticte&s;t di&s;ci|pline,
without interfering with the religion, government
or commerce of the republick: he likewi&s;e declared, that
the countries and places of which he might be obliged
to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;hould be detained no otherwi&s;e than a$
a pledge, to be re&s;tored as &s;oon as the United Province
&s;hould give convincing proofs that they would no longe$
furni&s;h the enemies of France with &s;uccours.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="199">
&sect; XX. While the States deliberated upon this decla|ration,
Count Lowendahl entered Dutch Brabant, and
inve&s;ted the town and fortre&s;s of Sluys, the garri&s;on of
which &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war on the
nineteenth day of April. This was likewi&s;e the fate of
Sas-van-Ghent; while the Marquis de Contades, with
another detachment, reduced the forts Perle and Leifken|&s;hoek,
with the town of Philippine, even within hearing
of the confederate army. The fort of Sanberg was vigo|rou&s;ly
defended by two Engli&s;h battalions: but they were
overpowered, and obliged to retire to Wel&s;thoorden; and
Count Lowendahl undertook the &s;iege of Hul&s;t, which
was &s;hamefully &s;urrendered by La Roque, the Dutch go|vernour,
though he knew that a re-enforcement of nine
battalions was on the march to his relief. Then the French
general took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Axel and Terneu&s;e, and began
to prepare flat-bottomed boats for a de&s;cent on the i&s;land of
Zealand. The Dutch people were now &s;truck with con|&s;ternation.
They &s;aw the enemy at their doors, and owed
their immediate pre&s;ervation to the Briti&s;h &s;quadron &s;ta|tioned
at the Swin, under the command of Commodore
Mitchel<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Not the per&s;on who commanded in the We&s;t-Indies.</NOTE>, who, by means of his &s;loops, tenders, and
&s;mall craft, took &s;uch mea&s;ures as defeated the intention
of Lowendahl. The common people in Zealand being
reduced to de&s;pair, began to clamour loudly again&s;t their
governours, as if they had not taken the proper mea|&s;ures
for their &s;ecurity. The friends of the Prince of
Orange did not neglect this opportunity of promoting his
intere&s;t. They encouraged their di&s;content; and exag|gerated
the danger: they reminded them of the year one
thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-two, when the French
King was at the gates of Am&s;terdam, and the republick
was &s;aved by the choice of a &s;tadtholder: they exhorted
them to turn their eyes on the de&s;cendant of tho&s;e heroes
who had e&s;tabli&s;hed the liberty and independence of the
United-Provinces: they extolled his virtue and ability;
his genero&s;ity, his ju&s;tice, his un&s;haken love to his coun|try.
The people in &s;everal towns, inflamed by &s;uch re|pre&s;entations
to tumult and &s;edition, compelled their
<PB N="194" REF="200">
magi&s;trates to declare the Prince of Orange &s;tadtholder.
He him&s;elf, in a letter to the &s;tates of Zealand, offered
his &s;ervices for the defence of the province. On the
twenty-eighth day of April, he was nominated captain-ge|neral
and admiral of Zealand. Their example was
followed by Rotterdam and the whole province of
Holland; and on the &s;econd day of May, the Prince
of Orange was, in the a&s;&s;embly of the States-General, in|ve&s;ted
with the power and dignity of &s;tadtholder, captain
general, and admiral of the United-Provinces. The vigo|rous
con&s;equences of this re&s;olution immediately appeared.
All commerce and contracts with the French were prohi|bited:
the pea&s;ants were armed and exerci&s;ed: a re&s;olu|tion
pa&s;&s;ed for making a con&s;iderable augmentation of the
army: a council of war was e&s;tabli&s;hed for enquiring
into the conduct of the governors who had given up
the frontier places; and orders were i&s;&s;ued to commence
ho&s;tilities again&s;t the French, both by &s;ea and land.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. Mean while, the Duke of Cumberland took
po&s;t with his whole army between the two Nethes, to co|ver
Bergen-op Zoom and Mae&s;tricht; and Mare&s;chal
Saxe called in his detachments, with a view to hazard
a general engagement. In the latter end of May, the
French King arrived at Bru&s;&s;els; and his general re&s;olved
to undertake the &s;iege of Mae&s;tricht. For this purpo&s;e
he advanced towards Louvain; and the confederates per|ceiving
his drift, began their march to make po&s;t between
the town and the enemy. On the twentieth day of June,
they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ground, and were drawn up
in order of battle, with their right at Bil&s;en, and their
left extending to Wirle, within a mile of Mae&s;tricht,
having in the front of their left wing the village of Laf|feldt,
in which they po&s;ted &s;everal battalions of Briti&s;h
infantry. The French had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights
of Herdeeren, immediately above the allies; and both
armies cannonaded each other till the evening. In the
morning, the enemy's infantry marched down the hill,
in a prodigious column, and attacked the village of Laf|feldt,
which was well fortified, and defended with amazing
<PB N="195" REF="201">
ob&s;tinacy. The a&s;&s;ailants &s;uffered terribly in their ap|proach,
from the cannon of the confederates, which was
&s;erved with &s;urpri&s;ing dexterity and &s;ucce&s;s; and they met
with &s;uch a warm reception from the Briti&s;h-mu&s;quetry
as they could not with&s;tand: but, when they were bro|ken
and di&s;per&s;ed, fre&s;h brigades &s;ucceeded with a&s;toni&s;h|ing
per&s;everance. The confederates were driven out of
the village: yet being &s;u&s;tained by three regiments, they
mea&s;ured back their ground, and repul&s;ed the enemy with
great &s;laughter. Neverthele&s;s, Count Saxe continued
pouring in other battalions; and the French regained
and maintained their footing in the village, after it had
been three times lo&s;t and carried. The action was chiefly
confined to this po&s;t, where the field exhibited a horrible
&s;cene of carnage. At noon the Duke of Cumberland
ordered the whole left wing to advance again&s;t the enemy,
who&s;e infantry gave way: Prince Waldeck led up the
centre: Mare&s;chal Bathiani made a motion with the right
wing towards Herdeeren, and victory &s;eemed ready to
declare for the confederates, when the fortune of the day
took a &s;udden turn to their prejudice. Several &s;quadrons
of Dutch hor&s;e, po&s;ted in the centre, gave way, and
flying at full gallop, overthrew five battalions of infantry
that were advancing from the body of re&s;erve. The French
cavalry charged them with great impetuo&s;ity, increa&s;ing
the confu&s;ion that was already produced, and penetrating
through the lines of the allied army, which was thus di|vided
about the centre. The Duke of Cumberland, who
exerted him&s;elf with equal courage and activity in at|tempting
to remedy this di&s;order, was in danger of being
taken; and the defeat would in all probability have been
total, had not Sir John Ligonier taken the re&s;olution of
&s;acrificing him&s;elf and a part of the troops to the &s;afety
of the army. At the head of three Briti&s;h regiments of
dragoons, and &s;ome &s;quadrons of Imperial hor&s;e, he
charged the whole line of the French cavalry, with &s;uch
intrepidity and &s;ucce&s;s, that he overthrew all that oppo&s;ed
him, and made &s;uch a diver&s;ion as enabled the Duke of
Cumberland to effect an orderly retreat to Mae&s;tricht.
<PB N="196" REF="202">
He him&s;elf was taken by a French carabineer, after his
hor&s;e had been killed: but the regiments he commanded
retired with deliberation. The confederates retreated to
Mae&s;tricht, without having &s;u&s;tained much damage from
the pur&s;uit, and even brought off all their artillery, except
&s;ixteen pieces of cannon. Their lo&s;s did not exceed &s;ix
thou&s;and men killed and taken; whereas the French gene|ral
purcha&s;ed the victory at a much greater expen&s;e. The
common cau&s;e of the confederate powers is &s;aid to have
&s;uffered from the pride and ignorance of their generals.
On the eve of the battle, when the detachment of the
Count de Clermont appeared on the hill of Herdeeren,
Mare&s;chal Bathiani a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion of the commander in
chief to attack them before they &s;hould be re-enforced,
declaring he would an&s;wer for the &s;ucce&s;s of the enterpri&s;e.
No regard was paid to this propo&s;al: but the &s;uperior
a&s;ked in his turn where the Mare&s;chal would be in ca&s;e
he &s;hould be wanted? He replied, &startq;I &s;hall always be
found at the head of my troops,&endq; and retired in di&s;gu&s;t.
The &s;ub&s;equent di&s;po&s;ition has likewi&s;e been blamed, in|a&s;much
as not above one half of the army could act,
while the enemy exerted their whole force.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. The confederates pa&s;&s;ed the Mae&s;e, and en|camped
in the duchy of Limburg, &s;o as to cover
Mae&s;tricht: while the French King remained with his
army in the neighbourhood of Tongres. Mare&s;chal
Saxe, having amu&s;ed the allies with marches and counter|marches,
at length detached Count Lowendahl with &s;ix-and-thirty
thou&s;and men to be&s;iege. Bergen-op-zoom, the
&s;tronge&s;t fortification of Dutch Brabant, the favourite
work of the famous engineer Coehorn, never conquered,
and generally e&s;teemed invincible. It was &s;ecured with
a garri&s;on of three thou&s;and men, and well provided with
artillery, ammunition, and magazines. The enemy ap|peared
before it on the twelfth day of July, and &s;ummoned
the governor to &s;urrender. The Prince of Saxe Hild|burghau&s;en
was &s;ent to its relief, with twenty battalions
and fourteen &s;quadrons of the troops, that could be mo&s;t
conveniently a&s;&s;embled: he entered the lines of Bergen-op-zoom,
<PB N="197" REF="203">
where he remained in expectation of a &s;trong
re-enforcement from the confederate army: and the old
Baron Cron&s;trom, whom the Stadtholder had appointed
governor of Brabant, a&s;&s;umed the command of the gar|ri&s;on.
The be&s;iegers carried on their operations with
great vivacity; and the troops in the town defended it
with equal vigour. The eyes of all Europe were turned
upon this important &s;iege: Count Lowendahl received
divers re-enforcements; and a con&s;iderable body of troops
was detached from the allied army, under the command of
Baron Schwartzemberg, to co-operate with the Prince
of Saxe-Hildburghau&s;en. The French general lo&s;t a
great number of men by the clo&s;e and continual fire of
the be&s;ieged; while he, in his turn, opened &s;uch a num|ber
of batteries, and plied them &s;o warmly, that the de|fences
began to give way. From the &s;ixteenth day of
July to the fifteenth of September, the &s;iege produced an
unintermitting &s;cene of horror and de&s;truction: de&s;pe|rate
&s;allies were made, and mines &s;prung with the mo&s;t
dreadful effects: the works began to be &s;hattered: the
town was laid in a&s;hes: the trenches were filled with
carnage: nothing was &s;een but fire and &s;moke; nothing
heard but one continued roar of bombs and cannon. But,
&s;till the damage fell chiefly on the be&s;iegers, who were
&s;tain in heaps; while the garri&s;on &s;uffered very little, and
could be occa&s;ionally relieved or re-enforced from the
lines. In a word, it was generally believed that Count
Lowendahl would be baffled in his endeavours; and by
this belief the governor of Bergen-op-zoom &s;eems to
have been lulled into a blind &s;ecurity. At length, &s;ome
incon&s;iderable breaches were made in one ravelin and two
ba&s;tions, and the&s;e the French general re&s;olved to &s;torm,
though Cron&s;trom believed they were impracticable; and
on that &s;uppo&s;ition pre&s;umed that the enemy would not
attempt an a&s;&s;ault. For this very rea&s;on Count Lowen|dahl
re&s;olved to hazard the attack, before the preparations
&s;hould be made for his reception. He accordingly regu|lated
his di&s;po&s;itions, and at four o'clock in the morning,
<PB N="198" REF="204">
on the &s;ixteenth day of September, the &s;ignal was made
for the a&s;&s;ault. A prodigious quantity of bombs being
thrown into the ravelin, his troops threw them&s;elves into
the fo&s;&s;&eacute;, mounted the breaches, forced open a &s;ally-port,
and entered the place, almo&s;t without re&s;i&s;tance. In a
word, they had time to extend them&s;elves along the cur|tains,
and form in order of battle, before the garri&s;on
could be a&s;&s;embled. Cron&s;trom was a&s;leep, and the &s;ol|diers
upon duty had been &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;uddenne&s;s and
impetuo&s;ity of the attack. Though the French had taken
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ramparts, they did not gain the town
without oppo&s;ition. Two battalions of the Scotti&s;h
troops, in the pay of the States-General, were a&s;&s;embled
in the market-place, and attacked them with &s;uch fury,
that they were driven from &s;treet to &s;treet, until fre&s;h re|enforcements
arriving, compelled the Scots to retreat in
their turn: yet, they di&s;puted every inch of ground, and
fought until two thirds of them were killed upon the &s;pot.
Then they brought off the old governour, abandoning
the town to the enemy: the troops that were encamped
in the lines retreating with great precipitation, all the
forts in the neighbourhood immediately &s;urrendered to the
victors, who now became ma&s;ters of the whole naviga|tion
of the Schelde. The French King was no &s;ooner
informed of Lowendahl's &s;ucce&s;s, than he promoted him
to the rank of Mare&s;chal of France; appointed Count
Saxe governour of the conquered Netherlands; and re|turned
in triumph to Ver&s;ailles. In a little time after this
tran&s;action, both armies were di&s;tributed into winter|quarters,
and the Duke of Cumberland embarked for
England.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. In Italy the French arms did not triumph
with equal &s;ucce&s;s, though the Mare&s;chal de Bellei&s;le &s;aw
him&s;elf at the head of a powerful army in Provence. In
April he pa&s;&s;ed the Var without oppo&s;ition, and took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Nice. He met with little or no re&s;i&s;tance in
reducing Montalban, Villafranca, and Ventimiglia;
while General Brown, with eight-and-twenty thou&s;and
<PB N="199" REF="205">
Au&s;trians, retired towards Final and Savona. In the
mean time, another large body, under Count Schuylem|berg,
who had &s;ucceeded the Marquis de Botta, co-ope|rated
with fifteen thou&s;and Piedmonte&s;e in an attempt to
recover the city of Genoa. The French King had &s;ent
thither &s;upplies, &s;uccours, and engineers, with the Duke
de Boufflers, as amba&s;&s;ador to the republick, who likewi&s;e
acted as commander in chief of the forces employed for its
defence. The Au&s;trian general a&s;&s;embled his troops in the
Milane&s;e: having forced the pa&s;&s;age of the Bochetta on
the thirteenth of January, he advanced into the territories
of Genoa, and the Riviera was ravaged without mercy.
On the la&s;t day of March he appeared before the city, at
the head of forty thou&s;and men, and &s;ummoned the re|volters
to lay down their arms. The an&s;wer he received
was, that the republick had fifty-four thou&s;and men in
arms, two hundred and &s;ixty cannon, thirty-four mor|tars,
with abundance of ammunition and provi&s;ion: that
they would defend their liberty with their la&s;t blood, and
be buried in the ruins of their capital, rather than &s;ub|mit
to the clemency of the court of Vienna, except by an
honourable capitulation, guaranteed by the Kings of
Great-Britain and Sardinia, the republick of Venice, and
the United Provinces. In the beginning of May, Genoa
was inve&s;ted on all &s;ides: a furious &s;ally was made by the
Duke de Boufflers, who drove the be&s;iegers from their
po&s;ts; but the Au&s;trians rallying, he was repul&s;ed in his
turn, with the lo&s;s of &s;even hundred men. General Schuy|lemberg
carried on his operations with &s;uch &s;kill, vigour,
and intrepidity, that he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the &s;ub|urbs
of Bi&s;agno; and in all probability would have re|duced
the city, had not be been obliged to de&s;i&s;t, in con|&s;equence
of the repeated remon&s;trances made by the King
of Sardinia and Count Brown, who repre&s;ented the nece&s;|&s;ity
of his abandoning his enterpri&s;e, and drawing off
his army, to cover Piedmont and Lombardy from the
efforts of Mare&s;chal de Bellei&s;le. Accordingly, he rai&s;ed
the &s;iege on the tenth day of June, and returned into the
<PB N="200" REF="206">
Milane&s;e, in order to join his Sardinian Maje&s;ty; while
the Genoe&s;e made an irruption into the Parme&s;an and
Placentin, where they committed terrible outrages, in
revenge for the mi&s;chiefs they had undergone.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. While the Mare&s;chal de Bellei&s;le remained at
Ventimiglia, his brother, at the head of four-and-thirty
thou&s;and French and Spaniards, attempted to penetrate
into Piedmont: on the &s;ixth day of July he arrived at
the pa&s;s of Exilles, a &s;trong fortre&s;s on the frontiers of
Dauphin&eacute;, &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of the river Doria.
The defence of this important po&s;t the King of Sardinia
had committed to the care of the Count de Brigueras,
who formed an encampment behind the lines, with fourteen
battalions of Piedmonte&s;e and Au&s;trians, while divers
detachments were po&s;ted along all the pa&s;&s;es of the Alps.
On the eighth day of the month the Piedmonte&s;e en|trenchments
were attacked by the Chevalier de Bellei&s;le,
with incredible intrepidity: but the columns were re|pul&s;ed
with great lo&s;s in three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive attacks. Impa|tient
of this ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition, and determined not to
&s;urvive a mi&s;carriage, this impetuous general &s;ei&s;ed a pair
of colours, and advancing at the head of his troops,
through a prodigious fire, pitched them with his own hand
on the enemy's entrenchments. At that in&s;tant he fell
dead, having received two mu&s;quet balls and the thru&s;t of
a bayonet in his body. The a&s;&s;ailants were &s;o much di&s;|pirited
by the death of their commander, that they forth|with
gave way, and retreated with precipitation towards
Se&s;trieres, having lo&s;t near five thou&s;and men in the at|tack.
The Mare&s;chal was no &s;ooner informed of his bro|ther's
mi&s;fortune than he retreated towards the Var, to join
the troops from Exilles: while the King of Sardinia, hav|ing
a&s;&s;embled an army of &s;eventy thou&s;and men, threatened
Dauphin&eacute; with an inva&s;ion: but the exce&s;&s;ive rains pre|vented
the execution of his de&s;ign. General Leutrum was
detached with twenty battalions to drive the French from
Ventimiglia; but, Bellei&s;le marching back, that &s;cheme
was likewi&s;e fru&s;trated: and thus ended the campaign.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="207">
&sect; XXV. In this manner was the French King baf|$ed
in his projects upon Italy: nor was he more for|$unate
in his naval operations. He had, in the preceding
$ear, equipped an expen&s;ive armament, under the command
$f the Duke d'Anville, for the recovery of Cape-Breton:
$ut it was rendered ineffectual by &s;torms, di&s;tempers, and
$he death of the commander. Not yet di&s;couraged by
$he&s;e di&s;a&s;ters, he re&s;olved to renew his efforts again&s;t the
Briti&s;h colonies in North-America, and their &s;ettlements
in the Ea&s;t-Indies. For the&s;e purpo&s;es two &s;quadrons
were prepared at Bre&s;t, one to be commanded by the Com|modore
De la Jonquiere; and the other, de&s;tined for In|dia,
by Mon&s;ieur de St. George. The mini&s;try of Great-Britain,
being appri&s;ed of the&s;e mea&s;ures, re&s;olved to in|tercept
both &s;quadrons, which were to &s;et &s;ail together.
For this purpo&s;e Vice-Admiral An&s;on and Rear-Admiral
Warren took their departure from Plymouth with a for|midable
fleet, and &s;teered their cour&s;e to Cape Fini&s;terre
on the coa&s;t of Gallicia. On the third day of May they
fell in with the French &s;quadrons commanded by La Jon|quiere
and St. George, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix large &s;hips of war,
as many frigates, and four armed ve&s;&s;els equipped by their
East India company, having under their convoy about
thirty &s;hips laden with merchandi&s;e. Tho&s;e prepared for
war immediately &s;hortened &s;ail, and formed a line of battle;
while the re&s;t, under the protection of the &s;ix frigates,
proceeded on their voyage with all the &s;ail they could
carry. The Briti&s;h &s;quadron was likewi&s;e drawn up in
line of battle: but Mr. Warren perceiving that the
enemy began to &s;heer off, now their convoy was at a con|&s;iderable
di&s;tance, advi&s;ed Admiral An&s;on to haul in the
&s;ignal for the line, and hoi&s;t another for giving cha&s;e and
engaging, otherwi&s;e the French would in all probability
e&s;cape by favour of the night. The propo&s;al was em|braced;
and in a little time the engagement began with
great fury, about four o'clock in the afternoon. The
enemy &s;u&s;tained the battle with equal conduct and valour,
until they were overpowered by numbers, and then they
<PB N="202" REF="208">
&s;truck their colours. The Admiral detached three &s;hips
in pur&s;uit of the convoy, nine &s;ail of which were taken;
but the re&s;t were &s;aved by the intervening darkne&s;s. About
&s;even hundred of the French were killed and wounded in
this action. The Engli&s;h lo&s;t about five hundred; and
among the&s;e, Captain Grenville, commander of the &s;hip
Defiance. He was nephew to the Lord Vi&s;count Cob|ham,
a youth of the mo&s;t amiable character and pro|mi&s;ing
genius, animated with the noble&s;t &s;entiments o$
honour and patrioti&s;m. Eager in the pur&s;uit of glory, he
ru&s;hed into the mid&s;t of the battle, where both his leg$
were cut off by a cannon ball. He &s;ubmitted to his fate
with the mo&s;t heroick re&s;ignation, and died univer&s;ally la|mented
and beloved. The &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h army
in this engagement was chiefly owing to the conduct,
activity, and courage of the rear-admiral. A con&s;idera|ble
quantity of bullion was found in the prizes, which
were brought to Spithead in triumph; and the trea&s;ure
being landed, was conveyed in twenty waggons to the
bank of London. Admiral An&s;on was ennobled, an$
Mr. Warren honoured with the order of the Bath.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. About the middle of June, Commodore Fox
with &s;ix &s;hips of war, crui&s;ing in the latitude of Cape Or$|tegal
in Gallicia, took above forty French &s;hips, richly
laden from St. Domingo, after they had been abandoned
by their convoy. But the French King &s;u&s;tained another
more important lo&s;s at &s;ea, in the month of October
Rear-Admiral Hawke &s;ailed from Plymouth in the be|ginning
of Augu&s;t, with fourteen &s;hips of the line, to
intercept a fleet of French merchant &s;hips bound for the
We&s;t-Indies. He crui&s;ed for &s;ome time on the coa&s;t o$
Bretagne; and at length the French fleet &s;ailed from th$
i&s;le of Aix, under convoy of nine &s;hips of the line, be&s;ide
$rigates, commanded by Mon&s;ieur de Letendeur. On the
fourteenth day of October the two &s;quadrons were i$
&s;ight of each other, in the latitude of Bellei&s;le. The
French commodore immediately ordered one of his great
&s;hips and the frigates to proceed with the trading &s;hips
<PB N="203" REF="209">
$hile he formed the line of battle, and waited the attack.
$t eleven in the forenoon Admiral Hawke di&s;played the &s;ig|nal
to cha&s;e, and in half an hour both fleets were engaged.
The battle la&s;ted till night, when all the French &s;quadron,
$cept the Intrepide and Tonant, had &s;truck to the Engli&s;h
$ag. The&s;e two capital &s;hips e&s;caped in the dark, and re|turned
to Bre&s;t in a &s;hattered condition. The French cap|tains
&s;u&s;tained the unequal fight with uncommon bravery
$d re&s;olution, and did not yield until their &s;hips were di&s;|$led.
Their lo&s;s in men amounted to eight hundred:
$e number of Engli&s;h killed in this engagement did not
$ceed two hundred, including Captain Saumarez, a gal|$nt
officer, who had &s;erved under Lord An&s;on in his expe|$tion
to the Pacifick Ocean. Indeed, it mu&s;t be owned,
$r the honour of that nobleman, that all the officers form|$
under his example, and rai&s;ed by his influence, approv|$l
them&s;elves in all re&s;pects worthy of the commands to
which they were preferred. Immediately after the action,
$dmiral Hawke di&s;patched a &s;loop to Commodore Legge,
$ho&s;e &s;quadron was &s;tationed at the Leeward I&s;lands,
$ith intelligence of the French fleet on merchant-&s;hips,
$tward bound, that he might take the proper mea&s;ures
$r intercepting them in their pa&s;&s;age to Martinique, and
$e other French i&s;lands. In con&s;equence of this advice,
$e redoubled his vigilance, and a good number of them
$ll into his hands. Admiral Hawke conducted his prizes
$ Spithead; and in his letter to the board of Admiralty
$clared that all his captains behaved like men of honour
$ring the engagement, except Mr. Fox, who&s;e conduct
$$ de&s;ired might be &s;ubjected to an enquiry. That gentle|man
was accordingly tried by a court-martial, and &s;u&s;|$ended
from his command, for having followed the ad|$ce
of his officers, contrary to his own better judgment:
$ut he was &s;oon re&s;tored, and afterwards promoted to the
$nk of admiral; while Mr. Matthews, who&s;e courage
$ver incurred &s;u&s;picion, &s;till laboured under a &s;u&s;pen|$on
for that which had been &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed in both
<PB N="204" REF="210">
the&s;e late actions, namely, engaging the enemy without
any regard to the line of battle.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. In the Mediterranean Vice-Admiral Medle$
blocked up the Spani&s;h &s;quadron in Carthagena; a&s;&s;i&s;ted
the Au&s;trian general on the coa&s;t of Villafranca; and in|tercepted
&s;ome of the &s;uccours &s;ent from France to the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Genoe&s;e. At his death, which happened
in the beginning of Augu&s;t, the command of that &s;qua|dron
devolved upon Rear-Admiral Byng, who proceeded
on the &s;ame plan of operation. In the &s;ummer, two Bri|ti&s;h
&s;hips of war, having under their convoy a fleet of
merchant &s;hips bound to North-America, fell in with the
Glorio&s;o, a Spani&s;h &s;hip of eighty guns, in the latitude
of the We&s;tern I&s;les. She had &s;ailed from the Havannah,
with an immen&s;e trea&s;ure on board, and mu&s;t have fallen
a prize to the Engli&s;h &s;hips, had each captain done his
duty. Captain Er&s;kine, in the Warwick, of &s;ixty guns,
attacked her with great intrepidity, and fought until his
&s;hip was entirely di&s;abled: but being un&s;u&s;tained by his
con$ort, he was obliged to haul off, and the Glorio&s;o ar|rived
in &s;afety at Ferrol: there the &s;ilver was landed, and
&s;he proceeded on her voyage to Cadiz, which, however,
&s;he did not reach. She was encountered by the Dart|mouth,
a Briti&s;h frigate of forty guns, commanded by
Captain Hamilton, a gallant youth, who, notwith&s;tand|ing
the inequality of force, engaged her without he&s;ita|tion:
but in the heat of the action, his &s;hip being &s;et on
fire by accident, was blown up, and he peri&s;hed with all
his crew, except a mid&s;hipman and ten or eleven &s;ailors,
who were taken up alive by a privateer that happened to
be in &s;ight. Favourable as this accident may &s;eem to the
Glorio&s;o, &s;he did not e&s;cape. An Engli&s;h &s;hip of eighty
guns, under the command of Captain Buckle, came up,
and obliged the Spaniards to &s;urrender, after a &s;hort but
vigorous engagement. Commodore Gri&s;&s;in had been &s;ent,
with a re-enforcement of &s;hips, to a&s;&s;ume the command
of the &s;quadron in the Ea&s;t-Indies; and although his ar|rival
&s;ecured Fort St. David's, and the other Briti&s;h &s;ettle|ments
<PB N="205" REF="211">
in that country, from the in&s;ults of Mon&s;ieur de
Bourdonnais, his &s;trength was not &s;ufficient to enable
$word$ to undertake any enterpri&s;e of importance again&s;t the
$$emy: the mini&s;try of England, therefore, re&s;olved to
$$uip a fre&s;h armament, that when joined by the &s;hips in
$$dia &s;hould be in a condition to be&s;iege Pondicherry,
$word$ principal &s;ettlement belonging to the French on the
$a&s;t of Coromandel. For this &s;ervice, a good number
$word$ independent companies was rai&s;ed, and &s;et &s;ail in the
$quel, with a &s;trong &s;quadron under the conduct of Rear-$dmiral
Bo&s;cawen, an officer of unque&s;tioned valour and
capacity. In the cour&s;e of this year, the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers
$ere &s;o alert and &s;ucce&s;sful, that they took &s;ix hundred
and forty-four prizes from the French and Spaniards,
whereas the lo&s;s of Great-Britain, in the &s;ame time, did
not exceed five hundred and fifty.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. All the belligerent powers were by this
$$me heartily tired of a war which had con&s;umed an im|men&s;ity
of trea&s;ure, had been productive of &s;o much
mi&s;chief, and in the events of which all, in their turns,
had found them&s;elves di&s;appointed. Immediately after
the battle of Laffeldt, the King of France had, in
a per&s;onal conver&s;ation with Sir John Ligonier, ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his de&s;ire of a pacification; and afterwards his mi|ni&s;ter
at the Hague pre&s;ented a declaration on the &s;ame
&s;ubject to the deputies of the States-General. The &s;ig|nal
&s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h arms at &s;ea confirmed him in
the&s;e &s;entiments, which were likewi&s;e re-enforced by a
variety of other con&s;iderations. His finances were almo&s;t
exhau&s;ted, and his &s;upplies from the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies
rendered &s;o precarious by the vigilance of the Briti&s;h crui&s;|ers,
that he could no longer depend upon their arrival.
The trading part of his &s;ubjects had &s;u&s;tained &s;uch lo&s;&s;es,
that his kingdom was filled with bankruptcies; and the
be&s;t part of his navy now contributed to &s;trengthen the
fleets of his enemies. The election of a &s;tadtholder had
united the whole power of the States-General again&s;t him,
in taking the mo&s;t re&s;olute mea&s;ures for their own &s;afety $word$
<PB N="206" REF="212">
his views in Germany were entirely fru&s;trated by the ele|vation
of the Grand Duke to the Imperial throne, and
the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace between the hou&s;es of Au&s;tria
and Brandenburgh; the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms in Italy
had not at all an&s;wered his expectation; and Genoa war
become an expen&s;ive ally. He had the mortification to
&s;ee the commerce of Britain flouri&s;h in the mid&s;t of war,
while his own people were utterly impoveri&s;hed. The
parliament of England granted, and the nation paid &s;uch
incredible &s;ums as enabled their &s;overeign not only to
maintain invincible navies and formidable armies, but
likewi&s;e to give &s;ub&s;idies to all the powers of Eu|rope.
He knew that a treaty of this kind was actu|ally
upon the anvil between his Britannick Maje&s;ty
and the Czarina, and he began to be apprehen&s;ive of
&s;eeing an army of Ru&s;&s;ians in the Netherlands. His
fears from this quarter were not without foundation. In
the month of November, the Earl of Hyndford, amba&s;|&s;ador
from the King of Great-Britain at the court of Ru&s;|&s;ia,
concluded a treaty of &s;ub&s;idy, by which the Czarina
engaged to hold in readine&s;s thirty thou&s;and men, and
forty gallies, to be employed in the &s;ervice of the confe|derates,
on the fir&s;t requi&s;ition. The States-General
acceded to this agreement, and even con&s;ented to pay
one-fourth of the &s;ub&s;idy. His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty,
moved by the&s;e con&s;iderations, made further advances to|wards
an accommodation both at the Hague and in Lon|don;
and the contending powers agreed to another con|gre&s;s,
which was actually opened in March at Aix-la-Chapelle,
where the Earl of Sandwich and Sir Thomas
Robin&s;on a&s;&s;i&s;ted as plenipotentiaries from the King of
Great-Britain.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. The elections for the new parliament in
England had been conducted &s;o as fully to an&s;wer the pur|po&s;es
of the Duke of Newca&s;tle, and his brother Mr.
Pelham, who had for &s;ome time wholly engro&s;&s;ed the ad|mini&s;tration.
Both Hou&s;es were a&s;&s;embled on the tenth
day of November, when Mr. On&s;low was unanimou&s;ly
<PB N="207" REF="213">
re-elected Speaker of the Commons. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was
$pened, as u&s;ual, by a &s;peech from the throne, congratu|$$ting
them on the &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Briti&s;h navy,
$$nd the happy alteration in the government of the United
$rovinces. His Maje&s;ty gave them to under&s;tand, that a
$$ngre&s;s would &s;peedily be opened at Aix-la-Chapelle, to
$oncert the means for effecting a general pacification; and
$eminded them that nothing would more conduce to the
$$cce&s;s of his negociation than the vigour and unanimity
$word$ their proceedings. He received &s;uch addre&s;&s;es as the
mini&s;ters were plea&s;ed to dictate. Oppo&s;ition now lan|gui&s;hed
at their feet. The Duke of Bedford was become
$word$ courtier, and in a little time appointed &s;ecretary of
$$ate, in the room of the Earl of Che&s;terfield, who had
$$tely executed that office which he now re&s;igned; and
the Earl of Sandwich no longer harangued again&s;t the ad|mini&s;tration.
This new Hou&s;e of Commons, in imita|tion
of the liberality of their predece&s;&s;ors, readily grati|$$ed
all the reque&s;ts of the government. They voted forty
thou&s;and &s;eamen, forty-nine thou&s;and land-forces, be&s;ides
eleven thou&s;and five hundred marines; the &s;ub&s;idies for
the Queen of Hungary, the Czarina, the King of Sardinia,
the Electors of Mentz and Bavaria, the He&s;&s;ians, and the
Duke of Wolfenbuttel: the &s;um of two hundred thirty-five
thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty-nine pounds was
granted to the provinces of New England, to re-embur&s;e
them for the expen&s;e of reducing Cape-Breton: five hun|dred
thou&s;and pounds were given to his Maje&s;ty for the
$$gorous pro&s;ecution of the war; and about one hundred
and firty-two thou&s;and pounds to the Scotti&s;h claimants,
$$lieu of their juri&s;diction. The &s;upplies for the en&s;uing
$ear fell very little &s;hort of nine millions, of which the
greater part was rai&s;ed on a loan by &s;ub&s;cription, chargea|ble
on a new &s;ub&s;idy of poundage exacted from all mer|chandi&s;e
imported into Great-Britain. Immediately after
$word$ rebellion was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the legi&s;lature had e&s;tabli&s;hed
$$me regulations in Scotland, which were thought nece&s;&s;a|$$
to prevent &s;uch commotions for the future. The High|landers
<PB N="208" REF="214">
were di&s;armed, and an act pa&s;&s;ed, for aboli&s;hing
their peculiarity of garb, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to keep $word$
party-di&s;tinctions, to encourage their martial di&s;po&s;ition
and pre&s;erve the memory of the exploits atchieved by the$$
ance&s;tors. In this &s;e&s;&s;ion a bill was brought in to enforc$$
the execution of that law, and pa&s;&s;ed with another act, $word$
the more effectual puni&s;hment of high trea&s;on in the
Highlands of Scotland. The practice of in&s;uring French
and Spani&s;h &s;hips at London being deemed the &s;ole cir|cum&s;tance
that prevented a total &s;tagnation of comme$$
in tho&s;e countries, it was prohibited by law under &s;eve$
penalties; and this &s;tep of the Briti&s;h parliament accele|rated
the conclu&s;ion of the treaty. Several other prude$$
mea&s;ures were taken in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, for the
benefit of the publick; and among the&s;e we may recke$$
an act for encouraging the manufacture of indigo in th$
Briti&s;h plantations of North America; an article $word$
which Great-Britain u&s;ed to pay two hundred thou&s;and
pounds yearly to the &s;ubjects of France. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was
clo&s;ed on the thirteenth day of May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1748.</NOTE> when the King
declared to both Hou&s;es, that the preliminaries of a gene|ral
peace were actually &s;igned at Aix-la-Chapelle by the
mini&s;ters of Great-Britain, France, and the United-Pro|vinces;
and that the ba&s;is of this accommodation was
general re&s;titution of the conque&s;ts which had been made
during the war. Immediately after the prorogation of par|liament
his maje&s;ty &s;et out for his German dominions, $word$
having appointed a regency to rule the realm in his ab&s;en$$&punc;</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The articles might have been much le&s;s un|favourable
to Great-Britain and her allies, had the mi|ni&s;try
made a proper u&s;e of the treaty with the Czarin$$
and if the confederates had acted with more vigo$$
and expedition in the beginning of the campaign. The
Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries might have been tran&s;ported by &s;ea $word$
Lubeck before the end of the preceding &s;ummer, in the
own gallies, which had been lying ready for u&s;e &s;ince the
month of July. Had this expedient been u&s;ed, the Ru&s;|&s;ian
troops would have joined the confederate army before
<PB N="209" REF="215">
the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t campaign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IX. 1748.</NOTE> But this ea&s;y and
expeditious method of conveyance was rejected for a
march by land, of incredible length and difficulty, which
could not be begun before the month of January, nor
accompli&s;hed till Mid&s;ummer. The operations of the
campaign had been concerted at the Hague in January,
by the re&s;pective mini&s;ters of the allies, who re&s;olved to
bring an army of one hundred and ninety thou&s;and men
into the Netherlands, in order to compel the French to
abandon the barrier which they had conquered. The
towns of Holland became the &s;cenes of tumult and in&s;ur|rection.
The populace plundered the farmers of the re|venue,
aboli&s;hed the taxes, and in&s;ulted the magi&s;trates;
&s;o that the States-General, &s;eeing their country on the
brink of anarchy and confu&s;ion, authorized the Prince of
Orange to make &s;uch alterations as he &s;hould &s;ee conve|nient.
They pre&s;ented him with a diploma, by which
he was con&s;tituted hereditary &s;tadtholder and captain-general
of Dutch Brabant, Flanders, and the upper quar|ter
of Guelderland; and the Ea&s;t-India company ap|pointed
him director and governor-general of their com|merce
and &s;ettlements in the Indies. Thus inve&s;ted
with an authority unknown to his ance&s;tors, he exerted
him&s;elf with equal indu&s;try and di&s;cretion in new-model|ling,
augmenting, and a&s;&s;embling the troops of the re|publick.
The confederates knew that the Count de
Saxe had a de&s;ign upon Mae&s;tricht: the Au&s;trian gene|ral
Bathiani made repeated remon&s;trances to the Briti&s;h
mini&s;try, entreating them to take &s;peedy mea&s;ures for the
pre&s;ervation of that fortre&s;s. He in the month of Janu|ary
propo&s;ed that the Duke of Cumberland &s;hould cro&s;s
the &s;ea, and confer with the Prince of Orange on this
&s;ubject: he undertook, at the peril of his head, to cover
Mae&s;tricht with &s;eventy thou&s;and men, from all attacks of
the enemy: but his repre&s;entations &s;eemed to have made
very little impre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed.
The Duke of Cumberland did not depart from England
$$ill towards the latter end of February: part of March
<PB N="210" REF="216">
was elap&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK II. 1748.</NOTE> before the tran&s;ports &s;ailed from the Nore with
the additional troops and artillery; and the la&s;t drafts
from the foot-guards were not embarked till the middle
of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. The different bodies of the confederate forces
joined each other, and encamped in the neighbourhood of
Ru$emond, to the number of one hundred and ten thou|&s;and
men; and the French army inve&s;ted Mae&s;tricht,
without oppo&s;ition, on the third day of April. The gar|ri&s;on
con&s;i&s;ted of Imperial and Dutch troops, under the
conduct of the governour, Baron d'Aylva, who defended
the place with extraordinary &s;kill and re&s;olution. He
annoyed the be&s;iegers in repeated &s;allies; but they were
determined to &s;urmount all oppo&s;ition, and pro&s;ecuted
their approaches with incredible ardour. They a&s;&s;aulted
the covered-way, and there effected a lodgment, after an
ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, in which they lo&s;t two thou&s;and of their
be&s;t troops: but, next day they were entirely di&s;lodged
by the gallantry of the garri&s;on. The&s;e ho&s;tilities were
&s;uddenly &s;u&s;pended, in con&s;equence of the preliminaries
&s;igned at Aix-la-Chapelle. The plenipotentiaries agreed,
that, for the glory of his Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's arms, the
town of Mae&s;tricht &s;hould be &s;urrendered to his general, on
condition that it &s;hould be re&s;tored, with all the magazines
and artillery. He accordingly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it on the
third day of May, when the garri&s;on marched out with
all the honours of war; and a ce&s;&s;ation of arms imme|diately
en&s;ued. By this time the Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries, to
the number of thirty-&s;even thou&s;and, commanded by
Prince Repnin, had arrived in Moravia, where they were
reviewed by their Imperial Maje&s;ties: then they proceeded
to the confines of Franconia, where they were ordered to
$alt, after they had marched &s;even hundred miles &s;ince
the beginning of the year. The French King declared,
that &s;hould they advance farther, he would demoli&s;h the
fortifications of Mae&s;tricht and Bergen-op zoom. This
di&s;pute was referred to the plenipotentiaries, who, in the
beginning of Augu&s;t, concluded a convention, importing
<PB N="211" REF="217">
that the Ru&s;&s;ian troops &s;hould return to their own country;
and that the French King &s;hould di&s;band and equal number
of his forces. The &s;ea&s;on being far advanced, the Ru&s;&s;ians
were provided with winter-quarters in Bohemia and Mo|ravia,
where they continued till the &s;pring, when they
marched back to Livonia. In the mean time &s;even-and-thirty
thou&s;and French troops were withdrawn from Flan|ders
into Picardy, and the two armies remained quiet till
the conclu&s;ion of the definitive treaty. The &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of
arms was proclaimed at London, and in all the capitals of
the contracting powers: orders were &s;ent to the re&s;pective
admirals in different parts of the world, to refrain from
ho&s;tilities; and a communication of trade and intelligence
was again opened between the nations which had been at
variance. No material tran&s;action di&s;tingui&s;hed the cam|paign
in Italy. The French and Spani&s;h troops, who had
joined the Genoe&s;e in the territories of the republick,
amounted to thirty thou&s;and men, under the direction of
the Duke de Richelieu, who was &s;ent from France to
a&s;&s;ume that command, on the death of the Duke de
Boufflers, while Mare&s;chal de Bellei&s;le, at the head of fifty
thou&s;and men, covered the we&s;tern Riviera, which was
threatened with an inva&s;ion by forty thou&s;and Au&s;trians
and Piedmonte&s;e, under General Leutrum. At the &s;ame
time General Brown, with a more numerous army, pre|pared
to re-enter the ea&s;tern Riviera, and re-commence the
&s;iege of Genoa. But the&s;e intended operations were pre|vented
by an armi&s;tice, which took place as &s;oon as the
$elligerent powers had acceded to the preliminaries.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. In the Ea&s;t-Indies, Rear-Admiral Bo&s;cawen
undertook the &s;iege of Pondicherry, which, in the month
of Augu&s;t, he blocked up by &s;ea with his &s;quadron, and
inve&s;ted by land with a &s;mall army of four thou&s;and Eu|$peans,
and about two thou&s;and natives of that country.
He pro&s;ecuted the enterpri&s;e with great &s;pirit, and took
he &s;ort of Area Coupan, at the di&s;tance of three miles
$om the town: then he made his approaches to the place,
again&s;t which he opened batteries, while it was bombarded
<PB N="212" REF="218">
and cannonaded by the &s;hipping. But the fortifications were
&s;o &s;trong, the garri&s;on &s;o numerous, and the engineers of
the enemy &s;o expert in their profe&s;&s;ion, that he made very
little progre&s;s, and &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable damage. At
length, his army being dimini&s;hed by &s;ickne&s;s, and the
rainy &s;ea&s;on approaching, he ordered the artillery and
&s;tores to be re-embarked; and rai&s;ing the &s;iege on the &s;ixth
day of October, returned to fort St. David, after having
lo&s;t about a thou&s;and men in this expedition. In the
&s;equel, &s;everal &s;hips of his &s;quadron, and above twelve
hundred &s;ailors, peri&s;hed in a hurricane. The naval force
of Great-Britain was more &s;ucce&s;sful in the We&s;t-Indies.
Rear-Admiral Knowles, with a &s;quadron of eight &s;hips,
attacked Fort Louis, on the &s;outh &s;ide of Hi&s;paniola, which
after a warm action of three hours was &s;urrendered on capi|tulation,
and di&s;mantled. Then he made an abortive
attempt upon St. Jago de Cuba, and returned to Jamaica,
extremely chagrined at his di&s;appointment, which he im|puted
to the mi&s;conduct of Captain Dent, who was tried
in England by a court-martial, and honourably acquitted.
On the fir&s;t day of October, the &s;ame admiral crui&s;ing in
the neighbourhood of the Havannah, with eight &s;hips of
the linc, encountered a Spani&s;h &s;quadron of nearly the
&s;ame &s;trength, under the command of the Admirals Reggio$
and Spinola. The engagement began between two and
three o'clock in the afternoon, and continued with inter|vals
till eight in the evening, when the enemy retired to
the Havannah, with the lo&s;s of two &s;hips; one of which
&s;truck to the Briti&s;h admiral, and the other was, two days
after, &s;et on fire by her own commander, that &s;he might
not fall into the hands of the Engli&s;h. Mr. Knowles
taxed &s;ome of his captains with mi&s;behaviour, and they re|criminated
on his conduct. On their return to England,
a court-martial was the con&s;equence of their mutual accu&s;a|tions.
Tho&s;e who adhered to the commander, and the
others whom he impeached, were inflamed again&s;t each
other with the mo&s;t rancorous re&s;entment. The admiral
him&s;elf did not e&s;cape uncen&s;ured: two of his captain$
<PB N="213" REF="219">
were reprimanded: but Captain Holmes, who had di&s;|played
uncommon courage, was honourably acquitted.
Their animo&s;ities did not end with the court-martial. A
bloodle&s;s encounter happened between the admiral and
Captain Powlet: but Captain Innes and Captain Clarke,
meeting by appointment in Hyde-park with pi&s;tols, the
former was mortally wounded, and died next morning;
the latter was tried, and condemned for murther, but in|dulged
with his Maje&s;ty's pardon. No naval tran&s;action
of any con&s;equence happened in the European &s;eas, during
the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer. In January, indeed, the Mag|nanime,
a French &s;hip of the line, was taken in the
channel by two Engli&s;h crui&s;ers, after an ob&s;tinate engage|ment;
and the privateers took a con&s;iderable number of
merchant &s;hips from the enemy.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. The plenipotentiaries &s;till continued at
Aix-la-Chapelle, di&s;cu&s;&s;ing all the articles of the definitive
treaty, which was at length concluded and &s;igned on the
&s;eventh day of October. It was founded on former treaties,
which were now expre&s;sly confirmed, from that of We&s;t|phalia
to the la&s;t concluded at London and Vienna. The
contracting parties agreed, That all pri&s;oners on each &s;ide
&s;hould be mutually relea&s;ed, without ran&s;om, and all con|que&s;ts
re&s;tored: That the duchies of Parma, Placentia,
and Gua&s;talla &s;hould be ceded as a &s;ettlement to the Infant
Don Philip, and the heirs-male of his body; but in ca&s;e
of his a&s;cending the throne of Spain, or of the two Sicilies,
or his dying without male-i&s;&s;ue, that they &s;hould revert
to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria: That the King of Great-Britain
&s;hould, immediately after the ratification of this
treaty, &s;end two per&s;ons of rank and di&s;tinction, to re&s;ide
in France, as ho&s;tages, until re&s;titution &s;hould be made of
Cape-Breton, and all the other conque&s;ts which his Bri|tannick
Maje&s;ty &s;hould have atchieved in the Ea&s;t or We&s;t-Indies,
before or after the preliminaries were &s;igned&punc;
That the a&s;&s;iento contract, with the article of the annual
&s;hip, &s;hould be confirmed for four years, during which the
enjoyment of that privilege was &s;u&s;pended &s;ince the com|mencement
<PB N="214" REF="220">
of the pre&s;ent war: That Dunkirk &s;hould re|main
fortified on the land &s;ide, and towards the &s;ea conti|nue
on the footing of former treaties. All the contracting
powers became guarantees to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia for the
duchy of Sile&s;ia and the county of Glatz, as he at pre&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them; and they likewi&s;e engaged to &s;ecure the
Empre&s;s-Queen of Hungary and Bohemia in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
her hereditary dominions, according to the pragmatick
&s;anction. The other articles regulated the forms and times
fixed for this mutual re&s;titution, as well as for the termina|tion
of ho&s;tilities in different parts of the world. But the
right of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects to navigate in the American &s;eas,
without being &s;ubject to &s;earch, was not once mentioned,
though this claim was the original &s;ource of the differences
between Great-Britain and Spain: nor were the limits of
Acadia a&s;certained. This and all other di&s;putes were left
to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of commi&s;&s;aries. We have already ob|&s;erved,
that after the troubles of the empire began, the war
was no longer maintained on Briti&s;h principles. It became
a continental conte&s;t, and was pro&s;ecuted on the &s;ide of
the allies without conduct, &s;pirit, or unanimity. In the
Netherlands they were outnumbered and outwitted by the
enemy. They never hazarded a battle without &s;u&s;taining a
defeat. Their va&s;t armies, paid by Great-Britain, lay in|active,
and beheld one fortre&s;s reduced after another, until
the whole country was &s;ubdued; and as their generals
fought their plenipotentiaries negociated. At a time
when their affairs began to wear the mo&s;t promi&s;ing a&s;pect;
when the arrival of the Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries would have
&s;ecured an undoubted &s;uperiority in the field; when the
Briti&s;h fleets had trampled on the naval power of France
and Spain, intercepted their &s;upplies of trea&s;ure, and cut
off all their re&s;ources of commerce; the Briti&s;h mini&s;ters
&s;eemed to treat, without the lea&s;t regard to the honour and
advantage of their country. They left their mo&s;t valuable
and nece&s;&s;ary rights of trade unowned and undecided:
they &s;ub&s;cribed to the in&s;olent demand of &s;ending the nobles
of the realm to grace the court, and adorn the triumphs
<PB N="215" REF="221">
of her enemy: and they tamely gave up her conque&s;ts in
North-America, of more con&s;equence to her traffick than
all the other dominions for which the powers at war con|tended;
they gave up the important i&s;le of Cape-Breton,
in exchange for a petty factory in the Ea&s;t-Indies, belong|ing
to a private company, who&s;e exi&s;tence had been deem|ed
prejudicial to the commonwealth. What then were the
fruits which Britain reaped from this long and de&s;perate
war? A dreadful expen&s;e of blood and and trea&s;ure<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Such an expen&s;ive war could not be maintained without a very extra|ordinary exertion of a commercial &s;pirit: accordingly, we find that Great-Britain, &s;ince the death of King William, has ri&s;en under her pre&s;&s;ures with increa&s;ed vigour and per&s;everance. Whether it be owing to the natu|ral progre&s;&s;ion of trade extending it&s;elf from its origin to its <HI>acme</HI> or <HI>n$ plus $ultra,</HI> or to the encouragement given by the admini&s;tration to moneyed men of all denominations; or to nece&s;&s;ity, impelling tho&s;e who can no longer live on &s;mall incomes to ri&s;que their capitals in traffick, that they may have a chance for bettering their fortunes; or, la&s;tly, to a concurrence of all the&s;e cau&s;es: certain it is, the national exports and imports have been &s;en&s;ibly increa&s;ing for the&s;e forty years: the yearly medium of woolen ex|ports, from the year 1738 to 1743 inclu&s;ive, amounted to about three mil|lions and an half, which was a yearly increa&s;e on the medium, of five hun|dred thou&s;and pounds above the medium from 1718 to 1724. From this article, the reader will conceive the prodigious extent and importance of the Briti&s;h commerce.</NOTE>, di&s;|grace
upon di&s;grace, an additional load of grievous impo|&s;itions,
and the national debt accumulated to the enor|mous

<P>&sect; I. THE peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK. III. 1748.</NOTE> however un&s;table
or inglorious it might appear to tho&s;e few who
under&s;tood the intere&s;ts, and felt for the honour of their
country, was neverthele&s;s not unwelcome to the nation
in general. The Briti&s;h mini&s;try will always find it more
difficult to &s;atisfy the people at the end of a &s;ucce&s;sful
campaign, than at the conclu&s;ion of an unfortunate war.
The Engli&s;h are impatient of mi&s;carriage and di&s;appoint|ment,
and too apt to be intoxicated with victory. At
this period they were tired of the burthens, and &s;ick of
the di&s;graces, to which they had been expo&s;ed in the cour&s;e
of &s;even tedious campaigns. They had &s;uffered con&s;i|derable
<PB N="219" REF="225">
lo&s;&s;es and interruption in the article of commerce,
which was the &s;ource of their national opulence and
$ower: they knew it would nece&s;&s;arily be clogged with
additional duties, for the maintenance of a continental
$ar, and the &s;upport of foreign &s;ub&s;idiaries; and they
$ew very faint pre&s;ages of future &s;ucce&s;s either from the
$$nduct of their allies, or the capacity of their command|$$s.
To a people influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, the
$&s;toration of a free trade, the re&s;pite from that anxiety and
$$&s;pen&s;e which the pro&s;ecution of a war never fails to en|$ender,
and the pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy deliverance from di&s;|$uraging
re&s;traint and oppre&s;&s;ive impo&s;itions, were ad|$antages
that &s;weetened the bitter draught of a di&s;honour|able
treaty, and induced the majority of the nation to
$quie&s;ce in the peace, not barely without murmuring,
$ut even with &s;ome degree of &s;atisfaction and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; II. Immediately after the exchange of ratifications at
$ix-la-Chapelle the armies were broke up: the allies in
the Netherlands withdrew their &s;everal proportions of
$oops; the French began to evacuate Flanders; and the
$ngli&s;h forces were re-embarked for their own country.
$is Britannick Maje&s;ty returned from his German dominions
in November, having landed near Margate, in Kent,
after a dangerous pa&s;&s;age; and on the twenty-ninth of the
$ame month he opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament. By this
$$me the mi&s;under&s;tanding between the two fir&s;t per&s;onages
$f the royal family had been increa&s;ed by a fre&s;h acce&s;&s;ion
$f matter. The Prince of Wales had held a court of
$annary, in quality of Duke of Cornwall; and revived
$ome claims attached to that dignity, which, had they
been admitted, would have greatly augmented his influ|ence
among the $orni&s;h boroughs. The&s;e efforts rou&s;ed
$he jealou&s;y of the admini&s;tration, which had always con|$$dered
them as an intere&s;t wholly dependent on the crown;
$word$, therefore, the preten&s;ions of his royal highne&s;s were
$ppo&s;ed by the whole weight of the mini&s;try. His adhe|$ents,
re&s;enting the&s;e ho&s;tilities as an injury to their royal
$a&s;ter, immediately joined the remnant of the former
<PB N="220" REF="226">
oppo&s;ition in parliament, and re&s;olved to counteract $word$
the mini&s;terial mea&s;ures that &s;hould fall under their cog|nizance;
at lea&s;t, they determined to &s;ei&s;e every oppor|tunity
of thwarting the &s;ervants of the crown, in every
&s;cheme or propo&s;al that had not an evident tendency to
the advantage of the nation. This band of auxiliaries
was headed by the Earl of E&mdash;t, Dr. Lee, and Mr. N&mdash;t&punc;
The fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;pecies of eloquence rather plau&s;ible
than powerful: he &s;poke with fluency and fire: his &s;pirit
was bold and enterpri&s;ing, his apprehen&s;ion quick, and his
repartee &s;evere. Dr. Lee was a man of exten&s;ive erudition
and irreproachable morals, particularly ver&s;ed in the civil
law, which he profe&s;&s;ed, and perfectly well acquainted
with the con&s;titution of his country. Mr. N&mdash;t was $word$
orator of middling abilities, who harangued upon all
&s;ubjects indi&s;criminately, and &s;upplied with confidence
what he wanted in capacity: he had been at &s;ome pain$
to &s;tudy the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e, as well as to under&s;tand
the machine of government; and was tolerably well heard,
as he generally &s;poke with an appearance of good-humour,
and hazarded every whim&s;ical idea, as it ro&s;e in his imagi|nation.
But Lord Bolingbroke is &s;aid to have been the
chief &s;pring, which, in &s;ecret, actuated the deliberations
of the Prince's court. That nobleman, &s;eemingly &s;e|que&s;tered
from the tumults of a publick life, re&s;ided at
Batter&s;ea, where he was vi&s;ited like a &s;ainted &s;hrine by all
the di&s;tingui&s;hed votaries of wit, eloquence, and political
ambition. There he was cultivated and admired for the
elegance of his manners, and the charms of his conver|&s;ation.
The Prince's curio&s;ity was fir&s;t captivated by his
character, and his e&s;teem was afterwards &s;ecured by the
irre&s;i&s;tible addre&s;s of that extraordinary per&s;onage, who
continued in a regular progre&s;&s;ion to in&s;inuate him&s;elf &s;till
farther and farther into the good graces of his royal patron.
How far the conduct of his royal highne&s;s was influenced
by the private advice of this nobleman we &s;hall not pre|tend
to determine: but, certain it is, the friends of the
mini&s;try propagated a report, that he was the dictator of
<PB N="221" REF="227">
$$o&s;e mea&s;ures which the Prince adopted; and that, under
$word$ &s;pecious pretext of attachment to the heir apparent of
$word$ crown, he concealed his real aim, which was to per|$$tuate
the breach in the royal family. Whatever his
$$ntiments and motives might have been, this was no other
$an a revival of the old mini&s;terial clamour, that a man
$$nnot be well affected to the King, if he pretends to
$n&s;ure any mea&s;ure of the admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The weight which the oppo&s;ition derived from
$$e&s;e new confederates in the Hou&s;e of Commons was
$ill greatly overbalanced by the power, influence, and
$bility that &s;u&s;tained every mini&s;terial project. Mr. Pel|$am,
who chiefly managed the helm of affairs, was gene|rally
e&s;teemed as a man of hone&s;ty and candour, actuated
$y a &s;incere love for his country, though he had been edu|$ated
in erroneous principles of government, and in &s;ome
mea&s;ure obliged to pro&s;ecute a fatal &s;y&s;tem, which de&s;cend|$d
to him by inheritance. At this time he numbered Mr.
$itt among his fellow-mini&s;ters, and was moreover &s;up|ported
by many other individuals of di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities;
among whom the fir&s;t place, in point of genius, was due
to Mr. M. who executed the office of &s;olicitor-general.
This gentleman, the &s;on of a noble family in North Bri|tain,
had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to great eminence at the bar, by
a mo&s;t keen intuitive &s;pirit of apprehen&s;ion, that &s;eemed
to &s;ei&s;e every object at fir&s;t glance, an innate &s;agacity, that
$aved the trouble of inten&s;e application, and an irre&s;i&s;tible
&s;tream of eloquence, that &s;lowed pure and cla&s;&s;ical, &s;trong
and copious, reflecting, in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous point of
view, the &s;ubjects over which it rolled, and &s;weeping before
$t all the &s;lime of formal he&s;itation, and all the entangling$
weeds of chicanery. Yet, the &s;ervants of the crown
were not &s;o implicitly attached to the fir&s;t mini&s;ter as to
acquie&s;ce in all his plans, and dedicate their time and
$alents to the &s;upport of every court-mea&s;ure indi&s;crimi|$ately.
This was one material point in which Mr. Pel|$am
deviated from the maxims of his predece&s;&s;or, who
admitted of no contradiction from any of his adherents or
<PB N="220" REF="228">

fellow-&s;ervants, but in&s;i&s;ted on &s;acrificing their whole per|ception
and faculties to his conduct and di&s;po&s;al. That
fordid deference to a mini&s;ter no longer characteri&s;ed the
&s;ubordinate in&s;truments of the admini&s;tration. It was not
unu&s;ual to &s;ee the great officers of the government divided
in a parliamentary debate, and to hear the &s;ecretary at
war oppo&s;ing with great vehemence a clau&s;e &s;ugge&s;ted by
the chancellor of the Exchequer. After all, if we coolly
con&s;ider tho&s;e arguments which have been bandied about,
and retorted with &s;uch eagerne&s;s and acrimony in the
Hou&s;e of Commons, and dive&s;t them of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate
tropes and declamatory metaphors which the &s;pirit of
oppo&s;ition alone had produced, we &s;hall find very little
left for the &s;ubject of di&s;pute, and &s;ometimes be puzzled
to di&s;cover any material &s;ource of di&s;agreement.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. In the month of November his Maje&s;ty opened
the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament with a &s;peech, acquainting them,
That the definitive treaty of peace was at length &s;igned
by all the parties concerned: That he had made the mo&s;t
effectual provi&s;ion for &s;ecuring the rights and intere&s;ts of
his own &s;ubjects; and procured for his allies the be&s;t con|ditions,
which, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, could
be obtained. He &s;aid he had found a general good di&s;po|&s;ition
in all parties to bring the negociation to a happy
conclu&s;ion; and ob&s;erved, that we might promi&s;e our|&s;elves
a long enjoyment of the ble&s;&s;ings of peace. Finally,
after having remarked that times of tranquillity were the
proper &s;ea&s;ons for le&s;&s;ening the national debt, and &s;trength|ening
the kingdom again&s;t future events, he recommended
to the Commons the improvement of the public revenue,
the maintenance of a con&s;iderable naval force, the ad|vancement
of commerce, and the cultivation of the arts of
peace. This &s;peech, as u&s;ual, was echoed back by an ad|dre&s;s
to the throne from both Hou&s;es, containing general
expre&s;&s;ions of the warme&s;t loyalty and gratitude to his
Maje&s;ty, and implying the mo&s;t perfect &s;atisfaction and
acquie&s;cence in the articles of the treaty of Aix-la-Cha|pelle.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="231">
&sect; V. The members in the oppo&s;ition, according to
cu&s;tom, cavilled at the nature of this addre&s;s. They
ob&s;erved, that the late pacification was the wor&s;t and mo&s;t
inglorious of all the bad treaties to which the Engli&s;h
nation had ever &s;ub&s;cribed: that it was equally di&s;grace|ful,
indefinite, and ab&s;urd: They &s;aid the Briti&s;h navy
had gained &s;uch an a&s;cendancy over the French at &s;ea,
that the &s;ources of their wealth were already choaked up;
that the &s;iege of Mae&s;tricht would have employed their
arms in the Low-Countries till the arrival of the Ru&s;&s;ians;
and that the acce&s;&s;ion of the&s;e auxiliaries would have
thrown the &s;uperiority into the &s;cale of the allies. They
did not fail to take notice, that the mo&s;t important and
original object of the war was left wholly undecided; and
demon&s;trated the ab&s;urdity of their promi&s;ing, in the addre&s;s,
to make good &s;uch engagements as his Maje&s;ty had entered
into with his allies, before they knew what tho&s;e engage|ments
were. In an&s;wer to the&s;e objections, the mini&s;ters
replied, That the peace was in it&s;elf rather better than
could be expected; and that the &s;malle&s;t delay might have
proved fatal to the liberties of Europe. They affirmed,
That the Dutch were upon the point of concluding a
neutrality, in con&s;equence of which their troops would
have been withdrawn from the allied army; and, in that
ca&s;e, even the addition of the Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries would
not have rendered it a match for the enemy. They a&s;&s;erted,
That if the war had been prolonged another year, the
national credit of Great Britain mu&s;t have been entirely
ruined, many of the publick funds having &s;unk below par
in the preceding &s;ea&s;on, &s;o that the mini&s;try had begun to
de&s;pair of &s;eeing the money paid in on the new &s;ub&s;cription.
With re&s;pect to the re&s;toration of Cape Breton, the limits
of Nova Scotia, and the right of navigating without
&s;earch in the American &s;eas, which right had been left
une&s;tabli&s;hed in the treaty, they declared, That the fir&s;t
was an unnece&s;&s;ary expen&s;e, of no con&s;equence to Great-Britain;
and that the other two were points in di&s;pute,
to be amicably &s;ettled in private conferences by commi&s;|&s;aries
<PB N="224" REF="232">
duly authorized; but by no means articles to be
e&s;tabli&s;hed by a general treaty.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. What the oppo&s;ition wanted in &s;trength $word$
endeavoured to make up with &s;pirit and per&s;everance.
Every mini&s;terial motion and mea&s;ure was canva&s;&s;ed,
&s;ifted, and decried with uncommon art and vivacity: but
all this little availed again&s;t the &s;ingle article of &s;uperior
numbers; and accordingly this was the &s;ource of certain
triumph in all debates in which the &s;ervants of the
crown were united. The nation had rea&s;on to expect $word$
immediate mitigation in the article of annual expen&s;e,
con&s;idering the number of troops and &s;hips of war which
had been reduced at the ratification of the treaty: but
they were di&s;agreeably undeceived in finding them&s;elves
again loaded with very extraordinary impo&s;itions, for the
payment of a va&s;t debt which government had contracted
in the cour&s;e of the war, notwith&s;tanding the incredible
aids granted by parliament. The committee of &s;upply
e&s;tabli&s;hed four points of con&s;ideration in their delibera|tions
concerning the &s;ums nece&s;&s;ary to be rai&s;ed, namely,
for fulfilling the engagements which the parliament had
entered into with his Maje&s;ty, and the &s;ervices undertaken
for the &s;ucce&s;s of the war; for di&s;charging debts con|tracted
by government; for making good deficiencies; and
for defraying the current expen&s;e of the year. It appeared
that the nation owed four-and-forty thou&s;and pounds to
the Elector of Bavaria; above thirty thou&s;and to the
Duke of Brun&s;wick; the like &s;um to the Landgrave o$
He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el; and near nine thou&s;and pounds to the Elector
of Mentz. The Queen of Hungary claimed an arrear of
one hundred thou&s;and pounds. The city of Gla&s;gow,
in North-Britain, pre&s;ented a petition, praying to be re|imbur&s;ed
the &s;um of ten thou&s;and pounds, extorted from
that corporation by the &s;on of the Pretender, during the
rebellion. One hundred and twelve thou&s;and pounds
were owing to the forces in North-America and the Ea&s;t-Indies;
be&s;ides near half a million due on extraordinary
expen&s;e incurred by the land-forces in America, Flanders,
<PB N="225" REF="233">
and North-Britain, by the office of Ordnance, and other
&s;ervices of the la&s;t year, to which the parliamentary pro|vi&s;ion
did not extend. The remaining debt of the Ord|nance
amounted to above two hundred and thirty thou&s;and
pounds: but the navy-bills could not be di&s;charged for
le&s;s than four millions. An addition of two millions
three hundred and &s;eventy-four thou&s;and three hundred
thirty-three pounds fifteen &s;hillings and two pence was al&s;o
required for the current &s;ervice of the year. In a word, the
whole annual &s;upply exceeded eight millions &s;terling&mdash;a
&s;um at which the whole nation expre&s;&s;ed equal a&s;toni&s;h|ment
and di&s;gu&s;t. It was charged upon the duties on malt,
$um, cyder, and perry, the land-tax at four &s;hillings in
the pound, annuities on the &s;inking fund, an application
of one million from that depo&s;it, and a loan of the like &s;um
to be charged on the fir&s;t aids of next &s;e&s;&s;ion. The num|ber
of &s;eamen was reduced to &s;eventeen thou&s;and, and
that of the land forces to eighteen thou&s;and eight hundred
and fifty-&s;even, including guards and garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. Every article of expen&s;e, however, was warmly
di&s;puted by the anti-courtiers; e&s;pecially the demand of
the Queen of Hungary, which was deemed unrea&s;onably
exorbitant and rapacious, con&s;idering the &s;eas of blood
which we had &s;hed, and the immen&s;ity of trea&s;ure we
had exhau&s;ted for her benefit: and &s;urely the &s;ubjects of
this nation had &s;ome rea&s;on to complain of an indulgence
of this nature, granted to a power which they had literally
&s;natched from the brink of ruin&mdash;a power who&s;e quarrel
they had e&s;pou&s;ed with a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m that did
much more honour to their gallantry than to their di&s;cre|tion&mdash;
a power that kept aloof, with a &s;tateline&s;s of pride
peculiar to her&s;elf and family, and beheld her Briti&s;h aux|iliaries
fighting her battles at their own expen&s;e; while
&s;he &s;quandered away, in the idle pageantry of barbarous
magnificence, tho&s;e ample &s;ub&s;idies which they advanced
in order to maintain her armies, and furni&s;h out her pro|portion
of the war. The leaders of the oppo&s;ition ne|glected
no opportunity of embittering the triumphs of
<PB N="226" REF="234">
their adver&s;aries: they inveighed again&s;t the extravagance
of granting &s;ixteen thou&s;and pounds for the pay of gene|ral
and &s;taff officers during a peace that required no &s;uch
e&s;tabli&s;hment, e&s;pecially at a juncture when the national
incumbrances rendered it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to practi&s;e
every expedient of oeconomy. They even combated the
reque&s;t of the city of Gla&s;gow to be indemnified for the
extraordinary exaction it underwent from the rebels,
though it appeared, from unque&s;tionable evidence, that
this extraordinary contribution was exacted on account of
that city's peculiar attachment to the reigning family:
that it had always invariably adhered to Revolution prin|ciples;
and, with an unequalled &s;pirit of loyalty and zeal
for the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf both in
the la&s;t and preceding rebellion.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. But the mo&s;t violent conte&s;t aro&s;e on certain
regulations which the mini&s;try wanted to e&s;tabli&s;h in two
bills, relating to the &s;ea and land &s;ervice. The fir&s;t, un|der
the title of a bill for amending, explaining, and re|ducing
into one act of parliament the laws relating to
the navy, was calculated &s;olely with a view of &s;ubjecting
half-pay officers to martial law&mdash;a de&s;ign which not only
furni&s;hed the oppo&s;ition with a plau&s;ible handle for accu&s;|ing
the mini&s;ters, as intending to encroach upon the con|&s;titution,
in order to extend the influence of the crown;
but al&s;o alarmed the &s;ea-officers to &s;uch a degree, that
they a&s;&s;embled to a con&s;iderable number, with a view to
deliberate upon the proper means for defending their privi|leges
and liberties from inva&s;ion. The re&s;ult of their con|&s;ultations
was a petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;ub|&s;cribed
by three admirals and forty-&s;even captains, not mem|bers
of parliament, repre&s;enting, That the bill in agitation
contained &s;everal clau&s;es tending to the injury and di&s;honour
of all naval officers, as well as to the detriment of his Ma|je&s;ty's
&s;ervice; and that the laws already in force had been
always found effectual for &s;ecuring the &s;ervice of officers on
half-pay, upon the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions: they, therefore,
hoped, that they &s;hould not be &s;ubjected to new hard&s;hips
<PB N="227" REF="235">
and di&s;couragements; and begged to be heard by their coun|$el,
before the committee of the whole Hou&s;e, touching
$uch parts of the bill as they apprehended would be inju|$ious
to them&s;elves and the other officers of his Maje&s;ty's
$avy. This petition was pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e by Sir
John Norris, and the motion for its being read was &s;e|conded
by Sir Peter Warren, who&s;e character was uni|ver&s;ally
e&s;teemed and beloved in the nation. This mea&s;ure
had like to have produced very &s;erious con&s;equences. Many
commanders and &s;ubalterns had repaired to the Admiralty,
and threatened, in plain terms, to throw up their commi&s;|&s;ions
in ca&s;e the bill &s;hould pa&s;s into a law; and a general
ferment was begun among all the &s;ubordinate members of
the navy. A motion was made, That the petitioners,
according to their reque&s;t, &s;hould be heard by their coun|&s;el;
and this propo&s;al was &s;trongly urged by the fir&s;t ora|tors
of the antimini&s;terial a&s;&s;ociation; but the mini&s;ter,
confiding in his own &s;trength, re-enforced by the abili|ties
of Mr. Pitt, Mr. Lyttelton, and Mr. Fox, the &s;e|cretary
of war, &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the motion, which,
upon a divi&s;ion, was thrown out by a great majority.
The &s;everal articles of the bill were afterwards &s;eparately
debated with great warmth; and though Mr. Pelham had,
with the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted air of candour, repeatedly de|clared
that he required no &s;upport, even from his own
adherents, but that which might ari&s;e from rea&s;on unre|&s;trained,
and full conviction, he, on this occa&s;ion, reaped
all the fruit from their zeal and attachment which could
be expected from the mo&s;t implicit complai&s;ance. Some
plau&s;ible amendments of the mo&s;t exceptionable clau&s;es
were offered, particularly of that which impo&s;ed an oath
upon the members of every court-martial, that they &s;hould
not, on any account, di&s;clo&s;e the opinions or tran&s;actions of
any &s;uch tribunal. This was con&s;idered as a &s;anction under
which any court-martial might commit the mo&s;t flagrant
acts of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, which even parliament
it&s;elf could not redre&s;s, becau&s;e it would be impo&s;&s;ible
to a&s;certain the truth, eternally &s;ealed up by this ab&s;urd
<PB N="228" REF="236">
obligation. The amendment propo&s;ed was, that the
member of a court-martial might reveal the tran&s;actions
and opinions of it, in all ca&s;es wherein the courts of ju&s;|tice,
as the law now &s;tands, have a right to interfere, if
required thereto by either Hou&s;e of parliament: a very
rea&s;onable mitigation, which, however, was rejected by
the majority. Neverthele&s;s, the &s;u&s;picion of an intended
encroachment had rai&s;ed &s;uch a clamour without doors,
and diffu&s;ed the odium of this mea&s;ure &s;o generally, that
the mini&s;ter thought proper to drop the projected article
of war, &s;ubjecting the reformed officers of the navy to the
juri&s;dictions of courts-martial; and the bill being al&s;o
&s;oftened in other particulars, during its pa&s;&s;age through
the Upper Hou&s;e, at length received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The flame which this act had kindled was
rather increa&s;ed than abated on the appearance of a new
mutiny-bill, replete with divers innovations, tending to
augment the influence of the crown, as well as the autho|rity
and power of a military juri&s;diction. All the articles
of war e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ince the reign of Charles the Second
were &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pection of the Commons; and
in the&s;e appeared a gradual &s;pirit of encroachment, almo&s;t
imperceptibly deviating from the civil in&s;titutes of the
Engli&s;h con&s;titution towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a mi|litary
dominion. By this new bill a power was ve&s;ted in
any commander in chief to revi&s;e and correct any legal
&s;entence of a court-martial, by which the members
of &s;uch a court, corre&s;ponding with the nature of a
civil jury, were rendered ab&s;olutely u&s;ele&s;s, and the com|mander
in a great mea&s;ure ab&s;olute; for he had not only
the power of &s;ummoning &s;uch officers as he might choo&s;e
to &s;it on any trial, a prerogative unknown to any civil
court of judicature: but he was al&s;o at liberty to re|view
and alter the &s;entence; &s;o that a man was &s;ub|ject
to two trials for the &s;ame offence, and the commander
in chief was judge both of the guilt and the puni&s;hment.
By the final clau&s;e of this bill, martial law was extended
to all officers on half-pay; and the &s;ame arguments which
<PB N="229" REF="237">
had been urged again&s;t this article in the navy-bill were
$ow repeated and re-enforced with redoubled fervour.
Many rea&s;ons were offered to prove that the half-pay was
allotted as a recompen&s;e for pa&s;t &s;ervice; and the oppo|nents
of the bill affirmed, that &s;uch an article, by aug|menting
the dependents of the crown, might be very dan|gerous
to the con&s;titution. On the other hand, the parti&s;ans
of the mini&s;try a&s;&s;erted that the half-pay was granted as a
retaining fee: and that originally all tho&s;e who enjoyed
this indulgence were deemed to be in actual &s;ervice, con|&s;equently
&s;ubject to martial law. Mr. Pitt, who at
this time exerci&s;ed the office of payma&s;ter-general with a
rigour of integrity unknown to the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted of
all his predece&s;&s;ors in that department, e&s;pou&s;ed the
calu&s;e in di&s;pute, as a nece&s;&s;ary exten&s;ion of military
di&s;cipline, which could never be attended with any bad
con&s;equence to the liberty of the nation. The remarks
which he made on this occa&s;ion implied an opi|nion
that our liberties wholly exi&s;ted in dependence
upon the direction of the &s;overeign, and the virtue
of the army. &startq;To that virtue (&s;aid he) we tru&s;t even
at this hour, &s;mall as our army is&mdash;to that virtue we
mu&s;t have tru&s;ted, had this bill been modelled as its
warme&s;t oppo&s;ers could have wi&s;hed; and without this
virtue, &s;hould the Lords, the Commons, and the people
of England entrench them&s;elves behind parchment up
to the teeth, the &s;word will find a pa&s;&s;age to the vitals
of the con&s;titution.&endq; All the di&s;puted articles of the
bill being &s;u&s;tained on the &s;houlders of a great majority,
it was conveyed to the Upper Hou&s;e, where it excited
another violent conte&s;t. Upon the que&s;tion whether
officers on half-pay had not been &s;ubject to martial law,
the judges were con&s;ulted and divided in their &s;entiments.
The Earl of Bath declared his opinion, that martial law
did not extend to reformed officers; and opened all the
$luices of his ancient eloquence. He admitted a ca&s;e
which was urged of &s;even officers on half-pay, who,
being taken in actual rebellion at Pre&s;ton, in the year
<PB N="230" REF="238">
1715, had been executed on the &s;pot by martial law, in
con&s;equence of the King's expre&s;s order. He candidly
owned, that he him&s;elf was &s;ecretary at war at that
period: that he had approved of this order, and even
tran&s;mitted it to General Carpenter, who commanded at
Pre&s;ton; but now his opinion was entirely changed. He
ob&s;erved, that when the forementioned rebellion fir&s;t broke
out, the Hou&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the King, de&s;iring
his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to employ all half-pay
officers, and gratify them with whole pay; and, indeed,
all &s;uch officers were voted on whole pay, by the Hou&s;e of
Commons. They were afterwards appri&s;ed of this vote,
by an adverti&s;ement in the Gazette, and ordered to hold
them&s;elves in readine&s;s to repair to &s;uch places as &s;hould
be appointed; and finally commanded to repair by &s;uch a
day to tho&s;e places, on pain of being &s;truck off the half|pay
li&s;t. The&s;e precautions would have been unnece&s;&s;ary,
had they been deemed &s;ubject to martial law; and the
penalty for non-obedience would not have been merely a
privation of their pen&s;ions, but they would have fallen
under the puni&s;hment of death, as de&s;erters from the
&s;ervice. His lord&s;hip di&s;tingui&s;hed, with great propriety
and preci&s;ion, between a &s;tep which had been precipi|tately
taken in a violent cri&s;is, when the publick was
heated with apprehen&s;ion and re&s;entment, and a &s;olemn
law concerted at lei&s;ure, during the mo&s;t profound tran|quillity.
Notwith&s;tanding the &s;pirited oppo&s;ition of this
nobleman, and &s;ome attempts to in&s;ert additional clau&s;es,
the bill, having undergone a few incon&s;iderable amend|ments,
pa&s;&s;ed by a very con&s;iderable majority.</P>
<P>&sect; X. Immediately after the mutiny bill had pa&s;&s;ed the
Lower Hou&s;e, another fruitle&s;s effort was made by the
oppo&s;ition. The danger of a &s;tanding army, on who&s;e
virtue the con&s;titution of Great-Britain &s;eemed to depend,
did not fail to alarm the minds of many who were zealou&s;ly
attached to the liberties of their country, and gave birth
to a &s;cheme, which, if executed, would have enabled the
legi&s;lature to e&s;tabli&s;h a militia that mu&s;t have an&s;wered
<PB N="231" REF="239">
many national purpo&s;es, and acted as a con&s;titutional bul|wark
again&s;t the exce&s;&s;es and ambition of a military &s;tand|ing
force, under the immediate influence of government.
The &s;cheme which patrioti&s;m conceived was, in all proba|bility,
adopted by party. A bill was brought in, limiting
the time beyond which no &s;oldier, or non-commi&s;&s;ioned
officer, &s;hould be compelled to continue in the &s;ervice.
Had this limitation taken place, &s;uch a rotation of &s;oldiers
would have en&s;ued among the common people, that in a
few years every pea&s;ant, labourer, and inferior trade&s;man
in the kingdom would have under&s;tood the exerci&s;e of
arms: and perhaps the people in general would have con|cluded
that a &s;tanding army was altogether unnece&s;&s;ary.
A project of this nature could not, for obvious rea&s;ons, be
agreeable to the admini&s;tration, and therefore the bill was
rendered abortive; for, after having been twice read, it was
po&s;tponed from time to time, till the parliament was pro|rogued,
and never appeared in the &s;equel. Such were the
chief &s;ubjects of debate between the mini&s;try and the op|po&s;ition,
compo&s;ed, as we have already ob&s;erved, of the
Prince's &s;ervants and the remains of the country party,
this la&s;t being headed by Lord Strange, &s;on of the Earl of
Derby, and Sir Francis Da&s;hwood; the former a noble|man
of di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, keen, penetrating, eloquent,
and &s;agacious; the other frank, &s;pirited, and &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. It mu&s;t be owned, however, for the honour of
the mini&s;try, that, if they carried a few unpopular mea|&s;ures
with a high hand, they &s;eemed earne&s;tly de&s;irous of
making amends to the nation, by promoting divers regu|lations
for the benefit and improvement of commerce,
which actually took place in the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion of parlia|ment.
One of the principal objects of this nature which
fell under their cognizance, was the trade to the coa&s;t of
Guinea; a very important branch of traffick, whether
con&s;idered as a market for Briti&s;h manufactures, or as the
&s;ource that &s;upplied the Engli&s;h plantations with negroes.
This was originally monopoli&s;ed by a joint-&s;tock com|pany,
which had from time to time derived con&s;iderable
&s;ums from the legi&s;lature, for enabling them the better to
<PB N="232" REF="240">
&s;upport certain forts or ca&s;tles on the coa&s;t of Africa, to
facilitate the commerce and protect the merchants. In the
&s;equel, however, the exclu&s;ive privilege having been
judged prejudicial to the national trade, the coa&s;t was laid
open to all Briti&s;h &s;ubjects indi&s;criminately, on condition
of their paying a certain duty towards defraying the ex|pen&s;e
of the forts and factories. This expedient did not
an&s;wer the purpo&s;es for which it had been contrived.
The &s;eparate traders, in&s;tead of receiving any benefit
from the protection of the company, indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided
their ca&s;tles, as the receptacles of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion.
The company, whether from the mi&s;conduct or knavery
of their directors, contracted &s;uch a load of debts as their
&s;tock was unable to di&s;charge. They &s;eemed to neglect
the traffick, and allowed the ca&s;tles to decay. In a word,
their credit being exhau&s;ted, and their creditors growing
clamorous, they pre&s;ented a petition to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
di&s;clo&s;ing their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and imploring &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
as &s;hould enable them not only to pay their debts, but
al&s;o to maintain the forts in a defen&s;ible condition. This
petition, recommended to the Hou&s;e in a me&s;&s;age from his
Maje&s;ty, was corroborated by another in behalf of the
company's creditors. Divers merchants of London, in|tere&s;ted
in the trade to Africa and the Briti&s;h plantations
in America, petitioned the Hou&s;e, that as the African trade
was of the utmo&s;t importance to the nation, and could not
be &s;upported without &s;orts and &s;ettlements, &s;ome effectual
means &s;hould be &s;peedily taken for protecting and extend|ing
this valuable branch of commerce. A fourth was
offered by the merchants of Liverpool, repre&s;enting, that,
the &s;ecurity and protection of the trade to Africa mu&s;t
always principally depend upon his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war
being properly &s;tationed on that coa&s;t, and &s;ea&s;onably
relieved; and that &s;uch forts and &s;ettlements as might be
judged nece&s;&s;ary for marks of &s;overeignty and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
would prove a nui&s;ance, and a burthen to the trade, &s;hould
they remain in the hands of any joint-&s;tock company, who&s;e
private intere&s;t always had been, and ever would be, found
<PB N="233" REF="241">
incompatible with the intere&s;t of the &s;eparate and open
trader. They, therefore, prayed that the &s;aid forts might
either be taken into his Maje&s;ty's immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
and &s;upported by the publick, or committed to the mer|chants
trading on that coa&s;t, in &s;uch a manner as the
Hou&s;e &s;hould judge expedient, without ve&s;ting in them
any other advantage, or right to the commerce, but what
&s;hould be common to all his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects. This
$emon&s;trance was &s;ucceeded by another, to the &s;ame effect,
from the ma&s;ter, wardens, a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and commonalty of
the &s;ociety of merchant adventures within the city of
Bri&s;tol. All the&s;e petitions were referred to a committee
appointed to deliberate on this &s;ubject; who agreed to
certain re&s;olutions, implying, That the trade to Africa
&s;hould be free and open; That the Briti&s;h forts and &s;et|tlements
on that coa&s;t ought to be maintained, and put
under proper direction; and, That, in order to carry on
the African trade in the mo&s;t beneficial manner to the&s;e
kingdoms, all the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects trading to Africa &s;hould
be united in one open company, without any joint-&s;tock,
or power to trade as a corporation. A bill was imme|diately
founded on the&s;e re&s;olutions, which alarmed the
company to &s;uch a degree, that they had recour&s;e to an|other
petition, demon&s;trating their right to the coa&s;t of
Africa, and expre&s;&s;ing their reliance on the ju&s;tice of the
Hou&s;e, that they &s;hould not be deprived of their property
without an adequate con&s;ideration. In a few days a &s;econd
addre&s;s was offered by their creditors, complaining of the
company's mi&s;management, promi&s;ing to &s;urrender their
right, as the wi&s;dom of parliament &s;hould pre&s;cribe;
praying that their debts might be enquired into; and that
the equivalent to be granted for the company's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
might be &s;ecured and applied, in the fir&s;t place, for their
benefit. The Commons, in con&s;equence of this petition,
ordered the company to produce a li&s;t of their debts, to|gether
with a copy of their charter, and two remon|&s;trances
which their creditors had pre&s;ented to them before
this application to parliament. A committee of the whole
<PB N="234" REF="242">
Hou&s;e, having deliberated on the&s;e papers and petitions$
and heard the company by their coun&s;el, re&s;olved to give
them a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation for their charter, lands,
forts, &s;ettlements, &s;laves, and effects, to be, in the fir&s;t
place, applied towards the payment of their creditors. A
bill being formed accordingly, pa&s;&s;ed the Commons, and
was conveyed to the Upper Hou&s;e, where a great many
objections were &s;tarted; and for the pre&s;ent it was drop|ped,
until a more unexceptionable plan &s;hould be con|certed.
In the mean time their lord&s;hips addre&s;&s;ed his
Maje&s;ty, That the lords commi&s;&s;ioners for trade and
plantations might be directed to prepare a &s;cheme on this
&s;ubject, to be laid before both Hou&s;es of parliament at
the beginning of next &s;e&s;&s;ion; That in&s;tant orders &s;hould
be given for pre&s;erving and &s;ecuring the forts and &s;ettle|ments
on the coa&s;t of Guinea belonging to Great-Britain&punc;
and, That proper per&s;ons &s;hould be appointed to examine
into the condition of tho&s;e forts, as well as of the military
&s;tores, &s;laves, and ve&s;&s;els belonging to the African com|pany,
&s;o as to make a faithful report of the&s;e particulars,
with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. The mini&s;try having profe&s;&s;ed an inclination,
and indeed &s;hown a di&s;po&s;ition, to promote and extend the
commerce of the kingdom, the Commons re&s;olved to take
&s;ome &s;teps for encouraging the white fi&s;hery along the
northern coa&s;t of the i&s;land, which is an inexhau&s;tible
&s;ource of wealth to our indu&s;trious neighbours the Dutch,
who employ annually a great number of hands and ve&s;&s;els
in this branch of commerce. The &s;en&s;ible part of the
Briti&s;h people, reflecting on this &s;ubject, plainly fore&s;aw
that a fi&s;hery under due regulations, undertaken with the
protection and encouragement of the legi&s;lature, would
not only prove a fund of national riches, and a nur&s;ery
of &s;eamen; but likewi&s;e, in a great mea&s;ure, prevent
any future in&s;urrections in the Highlands of Scotland, by
diffu&s;ing a &s;pirit of indu&s;try among the natives of that
country, who, finding it in their power to become inde|pendent,
on the fruits of their own labour, would &s;oon
<PB N="235" REF="243">
infranchi&s;e them&s;elves from that &s;lavi&s;h attachment by
which they had been &s;o long connected with their land|lords
and chieftains. Accordingly, a committee was ap|pointed
to deliberate on the &s;tate of the Briti&s;h fi&s;hery;
and upon their report a bill was founded for encouraging
the whale fi&s;hery on the coa&s;t of Spit&s;bergen, by a bounty
of forty &s;hillings per ton for every &s;hip equipped for that
undertaking. The bill having made its way through both
Hou&s;es, and obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent, the merchants in
different parts of the kingdom, particularly in North-Britain,
began to build and fit out &s;hips of great burthen,
and peculiar &s;tructure, for the purpo&s;es of that fi&s;hery,
which ever &s;ince hath been carried on with equal vigour
and &s;ucce&s;s. Divers merchants and traders of London
having pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Commons a petition,
repre&s;enting the benefits that would accrue to the com|munity
from a herring and cod fi&s;hery, e&s;tabli&s;hed on
proper principles, and carried on with &s;kill and integrity,
this remon&s;trance was referred to a committee, upon
who&s;e re&s;olutions a bill was formed; but, before this could
be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e, the parliament was prorogued,
and of con&s;equence this mea&s;ure proved abortive.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. The next regulation propo&s;ed in favour of
trade, was that of laying open the commerce of Hud&s;on's
Bay, in the mo&s;t northern parts of America, where a &s;mall
monopoly maintained a few forts and &s;ettlements, and
pro&s;ecuted a very advantageous fur-trade with the
Indians of that continent. It was &s;ugge&s;ted, that the
company had long ago enriched them&s;elves by their exclu|&s;ive
privilege; that they employed no more than four
annual &s;hips; that, contrary to an expre&s;s injunction in
their charter, they di&s;couraged all attempts to di&s;cover a
north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t-Indies; that they dealt
cruelly and perfidiou&s;ly with the poor Indians, who never
traded with them, except when compelled by nece&s;&s;ity, &s;o
that the be&s;t part of the fur-trade had devolved to the ene|mies
of Great-Britain; and that their exclu&s;ive patent
re&s;tricted to very narrow limits a branch of commerce,
<PB N="236" REF="244">
which might be cultivated to a prodigious extent, as well
as to the infinite advantage of Great-Britain. Petitions,
that the trade of Hud&s;on's-Bay might be laid open, were
pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e by the merchants of London, Great
Yarmouth, and Wolverhampton; and a committee was
appointed to deliberate upon this &s;ubject. On the other
hand, the company exerted them&s;elves in petitions and
private applications for their own pre&s;ervation. The com|mittee
examined many papers and records; and the report
was taken into con&s;ideration by the whole Hou&s;e. Many
evidences were interrogated, and elaborate &s;peeches made,
on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion. At length the majority
&s;eemed &s;atisfied that the traffick on the coa&s;t of Hud&s;on's.
Bay could not be pre&s;erved without forts and &s;ettlements,
which mu&s;t be maintained either by an exclu&s;ive company
or at the publick expen&s;e; and, as this was not judged a
proper juncture to encumber the nation with any charge
of that kind, the de&s;ign of di&s;&s;olving the company was laid
a&s;ide till a more favourable opportunity.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The government had, during the war, found
great difficulty in pre&s;&s;ing men for the &s;ervice of the navy&mdash;
a practice, which, however &s;anctioned by nece&s;&s;ity, is
neverthele&s;s a flagrant encroachment on the liberty of the
&s;ubject, and a violent outrage again&s;t the con&s;titution of
Great-Britain. The mini&s;try, therefore, had employed
&s;ome of their agents to form a &s;cheme for retaining in
time of peace, by means of a certain allowance, a number
of &s;eamen, who &s;hould be regi&s;tered for the purpo&s;e, and
be ready to man a &s;quadron upon any emergency. Such
a plan, properly regulated, would have been a great ad|vantage
to commerce, which is always di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the
practice of pre&s;&s;ing &s;eamen; and at the &s;ame time, a
great &s;ecurity to the kingdom in dangerous conjunctures,
when it may be nece&s;&s;ary to equip an armament at a mi|nute's
warning. The Hou&s;e of Commons being moved
upon this &s;ubject, agreed to divers re&s;olutions, as a founda|tion
for the bill: but the members in the oppo&s;ition a&s;&s;ect|ing
to repre&s;ent this mea&s;ure in an odious light, as an
<PB N="237" REF="245">
limitation of the French method of regi&s;tring &s;eamen
without their own con&s;ent, Mr. Pelham dropped it, as an
unpopular project.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. Information having been received, that the
French intended to &s;ettle the neutral i&s;lands of St. Lucia,
Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago, in the We&s;t-Indies,
the nation had taken the alarm in the beginning of the
year; and a motion was made in the Hou&s;e of Commons
to addre&s;s his Maje&s;ty, that he would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed
to give directions for laying before the Hou&s;e copies of the
in&s;tructions given to the governors of Barbadoes for ten
years la&s;t pa&s;t, &s;o far as they related to the&s;e neutral
i&s;lands: but whether the mini&s;ter was con&s;cious of a
neglect in this particular, or thought &s;uch enquiries
trenched upon the prerogative, he oppo&s;ed the motion with
all his might; and, after &s;ome debate, the previous que&s;|tion
pa&s;&s;ed in the negative. This was al&s;o the fate of
another motion made by the Earl of E&mdash;t for an addre&s;s,
entreating his Maje&s;ty would &s;ubmit to the in&s;pection of
the Hou&s;e all the propo&s;als of peace that had been made
by the French King &s;ince the year which preceded the
la&s;t rebellion, to that in which the definitive treaty was
concluded at Aix-la Chapelle. This they propo&s;ed as a
previous &s;tep to the parliament's forming any opinion con|cerning
the utility or nece&s;&s;ity of the peace which had been
e&s;tabli&s;hed. Violent debates en&s;ued, in which the oppo|&s;ition
was as much excelled in oratory as out-numbered in
votes. Such were the material tran&s;actions of this &s;e&s;&s;ion,
which in the month of June was clo&s;ed as u&s;ual with a
&s;peech from the throne; in which his Maje&s;ty &s;ignified
his hope, that the parliament, at their next meeting,
would be able to perfect what they had now begun for
advancing the trade and navigation of the kingdom. He
likewi&s;e expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing publick credit
flouri&s;h at the end of an expen&s;ive war; and recommended
unanimity, as the &s;ure&s;t bulwark of national &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. While the mini&s;try, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, ex|hibited
all the external &s;igns of moderation and good
<PB N="238" REF="246">
humour; they, on others, manife&s;ted a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y
and re&s;entment, which &s;eems to have been childi&s;h and
illiberal. Two or three young riotous &s;tudents at Oxford,
trained up in prejudice, and heated with intemperance,
uttered &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions over their cups, implying their
attachment to the family of the Pretender. The report
of this indi&s;cretion was indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated by certain
worthle&s;s individuals, who, having no reliance on their
own intrin&s;ick merit, hoped to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves as the
tools of party, and to obtain favour with the mini&s;try by
acting as volunteers in the infamous practice of informa|tion.
Though neither the age, rank, nor connexions
of the delinquents were &s;uch as ought to have attracted
the notice of the publick, the vice-chancellor, heads of
hou&s;es, and proctors of the univer&s;ity, knowing the in|vidious
&s;crutiny to which their conduct was &s;ubjected,
thought proper to publi&s;h a declaration, &s;ignifying their
abhorrence of all &s;editious practices, their determined re|&s;olution
to puni&s;h all offenders to the utmo&s;t &s;everity and
rigour of the &s;tatutes; and containing peremptory orders
for the regulation of the univer&s;ity. Notwith&s;tanding
the&s;e wi&s;e and &s;alutary precautions, the three boys, who,
in the heat of their intoxication, had drunk the Pretend|er's
health, were taken into cu&s;tody by a me&s;&s;enger of
&s;tate; and two of them being tryed in the court of King's-Bench,
and found guilty, were &s;entenced to walk through
the courts of We&s;tmini&s;ter, with a &s;pecification of their
crime fixed to their foreheads; to pay a fine of five nobles
each; to be impri&s;oned for two years, and find &s;ecurity
for their good behaviour for the term of &s;even years after
their enlargement. Many people thought they &s;aw the
proceedings of the &s;tar-chamber revived in the &s;everity of
this puni&s;hment. The admini&s;tration, not yet &s;ati&s;fied
with the vengeance which had been taken on the&s;e three
&s;triplings, &s;eemed determined to &s;tigmatize the univer&s;ity
to which they belonged. The cry of Jacobiti&s;m was
loudly trumpeted again&s;t the whole community. The
addre&s;s of the univer&s;ity, congratulating his Maje&s;ty on
<PB N="239" REF="247">
$he e&s;tabli&s;hment of the peace, was rejected with di&s;dain,
$nd an attempt was made to &s;ubject their &s;tatues to the
$n&s;pection of the King's council: but this rule, being
$rgued in the court of King's-Bench, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, in
$on&s;equence of the opinions given by the judges. Finally,
$he &s;ame tribunal granted an information again&s;t Dr.
$urnel, the vice-chancellor, for his behaviour in the ca&s;e
$f the rioters above-mentioned: but this was counter|manded
in the &s;equel, his conduct appearing unexception|$ble
upon a more cool and impartial enquiry.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. In proportion as Oxford declined, her &s;i&s;ter|univer&s;ity
ro&s;e in the favour of the admini&s;tration, which
$he at this period cultivated by an extraordinary mark of
compliance and attachment. The dignity of Chancellor
of the univer&s;ity being vacated by the death of the Duke
of Somer&s;et, the nation in general &s;eemed to think it
would naturally devolve upon the Prince of Wales, as a
compliment at all times due to that rank; but more e&s;pe|cially
to the then heir apparent, who had eminently
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by the virtues of a patriot and a
prince. He had even pleased himself with the hope of
receiving this mark of attachment from a &s;eminary for
which he entertained a particular regard. But the ruling
members, &s;eeing no immediate pro&s;pect of advantage in
glorifying even a prince, who was at variance with the mi|ni&s;try,
wi&s;ely turned their eyes upon the illu&s;trious charac|ter
of the Duke of Newca&s;tle, whom they elected without
oppo&s;ition, and in&s;talled with great magnificence; learning,
poetry, and eloquence, joining their efforts in celebrating
$he &s;hining virtues and extraordinary talents of their new
patron.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. Although oppo&s;ition lay ga&s;ping at the feet
of power in the Hou&s;e of Commons, the people of
England did not yet implicity approve all the mea&s;ures of
the admini&s;tration; and the dregs of faction, &s;till agi|tated
by an internal ferment, threw up &s;ome ineffectual
bubbles in different parts of the kingdom. Some of tho&s;e
who made no &s;ecret of their di&s;affection to the reigning
family determined to manife&s;t their re&s;entment and con|tempt
<PB N="240" REF="248">
of certain noblemen, and others, who were &s;aid to
have abandoned their ancient principles, and to have sacri|ficed
their con&s;ciences to their interest. Many individuals,
animated by the fumes of inebriation, now loudly extolled
that cau&s;e which they dur&s;t not avow when it required
their open approbation and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, though they
indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided expo&s;ing their lives and fortunes to
the chance of war in promoting their favourite intere&s;t
when there was a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s, they betrayed no
apprehen&s;ion in celebrating the memory of its la&s;t effort,
amid&s;t the tumult of a riot, and the clamours of intem|perance.
In the neighbourhood of Lichfield the &s;port&s;|men
of the party appeared in the Highland ta&s;te of va|riegated
drapery; and their zeal de&s;cending to a very ex|traordinary
exhibition of practical ridicule, they hunted,
with hounds clothed in plaid, a fox dre&s;&s;ed in red uni|form.
Even the females at their a&s;&s;embly, and the gen|tlemen
at the races, affected to wear the checquered &s;tuff
by which the Prince Pretender and his followers had been
di&s;tingui&s;hed. Divers noblemen on the cour&s;e were in|&s;ulted
as apo&s;tates; and one per&s;onage, of high rank, is
&s;aid to have undergone a very di&s;agreeable flagellation.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. As the publick generally &s;uffers at the end of a
war, by the &s;udden di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of a great number of &s;oldiers
and &s;eamen, who, having contracted a habit of idlene&s;s,
and finding them&s;elves without employment and the means
of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, engage in de&s;perate cour&s;es, and prey upon
the community, it was judged expedient to provide an$
opening, through which the&s;e unquiet &s;pirits might ex|hale
without damage to the commonwealth. The mo&s;t
natural was that of encouraging them to become members
of a new colony in North America, which, being pro|perly
regulated, &s;upported, and improved might be the
&s;ource of great advantage to its mother country. Many
di&s;putes had ari&s;en between the &s;ubjects of England and
France, concerning the limits of Nova-Scotia, which n$$
treaty had as yet properly a&s;certained. A &s;ort had been
rai&s;ed, and a &s;mall garri&s;on maintained, by the King of
<PB N="241" REF="249">
Great-Britain, at a part of this very country, called
Annapolis-Royal, to overawe the French neutrals &s;ettled
in the neighbourhood: but this did not an&s;wer the pur|po&s;e
for which it was intended. Upon every rupture of
di&s;pute between the two crowns, the&s;e planters, forgetting
their neutrality, intrigued with the Indians, communi|cated
intelligence to their own countrymen &s;ettled at St.
John's and Cape-Breton, and did all the ill-offices their
hatred could &s;ugge&s;t again&s;t the colonies and &s;ubjects of
Great-Britain. A &s;cheme was now formed for making a
new e&s;tabli&s;hment on the &s;ame penin&s;ula, which &s;hould
further confirm and extend the property and dominion of
the crown of Great-Britain in that large tract of country,
clear the uncultivated grounds, con&s;titute communities,
diffu&s;e the benefits of population and agriculture, and im|prove
the fi&s;hery of that coa&s;t, which might be rendered a
new &s;ource of wealth and commerce to Old England. The
particulars of the plan being duly con&s;idered, it was laid
before his Maje&s;ty, who approved of the de&s;ign, and re|ferred
the execution of it to the board of trade and plan|tations,
over which the Earl of Hallifax pre&s;ided. This
nobleman, endued by nature with an excellent capacity,
which had been diligently and judiciou&s;ly cultivated, ani|mated
with liberal &s;entiments, and fired with an eager
&s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, adopted the plan with the mo&s;t gene|rous
ardour, and cheri&s;hed the infant colony with paternal
affection. The commi&s;&s;ioners for trade and plantations
immediately adverti&s;ed, under the &s;anction of his Maje&s;ty's
authority, That proper encouragement would be given to
&s;uch of the officers and private men, lately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from
the land and &s;ea-&s;ervice, as were willing to &s;ettle, with
or without families, in the province of Nova-Scotia:
That the &s;ee-&s;imple, or perpetual property, of fifty acres
of land &s;hould be granted to every private &s;oldier or &s;ea|man,
free from the payment of any quit-rents or taxes, for
the term of ten years; at the expiration of which no per|&s;on
&s;hould pay more than one &s;hilling per annum for every
fifty acres &s;o granted: That, over and above the&s;e fifty.
<PB N="242" REF="250">
each per&s;on &s;hould receive a grant of ten acres for every
individual, including women and children, of which his
family &s;hould con&s;i&s;t: that further grants &s;hould be made
to them as the number &s;hould increa&s;e, and in proportion as
they &s;hould manife&s;t their abilities in agriculture: That
every officer, under the rank of en&s;ign in the land &s;ervice,
or lieutenant in the navy, &s;hould be gratified with four|&s;core
acres on the &s;ame conditions: That two hundred
acres &s;hould be be&s;towed upon en&s;igns, three hundred
upon lieutenants, four hundred upon captains, and &s;ix
hundred on every officer above that degree, with propor|tionable
con&s;iderations for the number and increa&s;e of
every family: That the lands &s;hould be parcelled out as
&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after the arrival of the coloni&s;ts, and a
civil government e&s;tabli&s;hed; by virtue of which they
&s;hould enjoy all the liberties and privileges of Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects,
with proper &s;ecurity and protection: That the
&s;ettlers, with their families, &s;hould be conveyed to Nova-Scotia,
and maintained for twelve months after their
arrival at the expen&s;e of the government; which &s;hould
al&s;o &s;upply them with arms and ammunition, as far as
&s;hould be judged nece&s;&s;ary for their defence, with proper
materials and uten&s;ils for clearing and cultivating their
lands, erecting habitations, exerci&s;ing the fi&s;hery, and
&s;uch other purpo&s;es &s;hould be judged nece&s;&s;ary for their
&s;upport.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. The &s;cheme was &s;o fea&s;ible, and the encourage|ment
&s;o inviting, that in a little time about four thou&s;and
adventurers, with their families, were entered, according
to the directions of the board of trade, who in the begin|ning
of May &s;et &s;ail from England, under the command
of Colonel Cornwallis, whom the King had appointed
their governor, and towards the latter end of June arrived
at the place of their de&s;tination, which was the harbour of
Chebuctou, on the &s;ea-coa&s;t of the penin&s;ula, about mid|way
between Cape Can&ccedil;eau and Cape Sable. It is one
of the mo&s;t &s;ecure and commodious havens in the whole
world, and well &s;ituated for the fi&s;hery: yet the climate is
<PB N="243" REF="251">
cold, the &s;oil barren, and the whole country covered with
woods of birch, fir, pine, and &s;ome oak, unfit for the
purpo&s;es of timber; but at the &s;ame time extremely diffi|cult
to remove and extirpate. Governor Cornwallis no
&s;ooner arrived in this harbour than he was joined by two
$egiments of infantry from Cape-Breton, and a company
of rangers from Annapolis. Then he pitched upon a &s;pot
for the &s;ettlement, and employed his people in clearing
the ground for laying the foundations of a town; but
&s;ome inconveniencies being di&s;covered in this &s;ituation,
$e cho&s;e another to the northward, hard by the harbour,
$n an ea&s;y a&s;cent, commanding a pro&s;pect of the whole
penin&s;ula, and well &s;upplied with rivulets of fre&s;h and
whole&s;ome water. Here he began to build a town, on a
regular plan, to which he gave the name of Hallifax, in
honour of the nobleman who had the greate&s;t &s;hare in
founding the colony; and before the approach of win|$er
above three hundred comfortable wooden hou&s;es
were built, the whole &s;urrounded by a &s;trong pali&s;ade.
This colony, however, has by no means an&s;wered the
$anguine expectations of the projectors; for, notwith|&s;tanding
the ardour with which the intere&s;ts of it were
promoted by its noble patron, and the repeated indul|gence
it has reaped from the bounty of the legi&s;lature, the
inhabitants have made little or no progre&s;s in agricul|ture:
the fi&s;hery is altogether neglected, and the &s;ettle|ment
entirely &s;ub&s;i&s;ts on the &s;ums expended by the indi|viduals
of the army and navy, who&s;e duty obliges them
to re&s;ide in this part of North-America.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch a powerful colony
in Nova-Scotia could not $ail giving umbrage to the
French in that neighbourhood, who, though they did
not think proper to promulgate their jealou&s;y and di&s;gu&s;t,
neverthele&s;s employed their emi&s;&s;aries clande&s;tinely in &s;ti|mulating
and exciting the Indians to harra&s;s the coloni&s;ts
with ho&s;tilities, in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould effectually
under them from extending their plantations, and per|haps
induce them to abandon the &s;ettlement. Nor was
<PB N="244" REF="252">
this the only part of America in which the French court
countenanced &s;uch perfidious practices. More than ever
convinced of the importance of a con&s;iderable navy, and
an exten&s;ive plantation trade, they not only exerted un|common
indu&s;try in re-e&s;tabli&s;hing their marine, which
had &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely during the war; but they re&s;olved,
if po&s;&s;ible, to extend their plantations in the We&s;t-In|dies,
by &s;ettling the neutral i&s;lands, which we have
already mentioned. In the beginning of the year the
governour of Barbadoes, having received intelligence that
the French had begun to &s;ettle the i&s;land of Tobago,
&s;ent Captain Tyrrel thither in a frigate, to learn the
particulars. That officer found above three hundred men
already landed, &s;ecured by two batteries and two &s;hips of
war, and in daily expectation of a further re-enforcement
from the Marquis de Caylus, governour of Martinique;
who had publi&s;hed an ordonnance, authori&s;ing the &s;ub|jects
of the French King to &s;ettle the i&s;land of Tobago,
and promi&s;ing to defend them from the attempts of all
their enemies. This a&s;&s;urance was in an&s;wer to a procla|mation
i&s;&s;ued by Mr. Grenville, governour of Barbadoes,
and &s;tuck up in different parts of the i&s;land, command|ing
all the inhabitants to remove in thirty days, on pain
of undergoing military execution. Captain Tyrrel, with
a &s;pirit that became a commander in the Briti&s;h navy,
gave the French officers to under&s;tand, that his Mo&s;$
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty had no right to &s;ettle the i&s;land, which
was declared neutral by treaties; and that, if they would
not de&s;i&s;t, he &s;hould be obliged to employ force in driving
them from their new &s;ettlement. Night coming on,
and Mr. Tyrrel's &s;hip falling to leeward, the French
captains &s;ei&s;ed that opportunity of &s;ailing to Martinique;
and next day the Engli&s;h commander returned to Barba|does,
having no power to commit ho&s;tilities. The&s;e
tidings, with a copy of the French governour's ordon|nance,
were no &s;ooner tran&s;mitted to the mini&s;try than
they di&s;patched a courier to the Engli&s;h convoy at Paris,
with directions to make repre&s;entations to the court of
<PB N="245" REF="253">
Ver&s;ailles on this &s;ubject. The mini&s;try of France,
knowing they were in no condition to &s;upport the con|&s;equences
of an immediate rupture, and under&s;tanding
how much the merchants and people of Great-Britain
were alarmed and incen&s;ed at their attempts to po&s;&s;e&s;s
the&s;e i&s;lands, thought proper to di&s;own the proceedings
of the Marquis de Caylus, and to grant the &s;atisfaction
that was demanded, by &s;ending him orders to di&s;continue
the &s;ettlement, and evacuate the i&s;land of Tobago. At
the &s;ame time, however, that the court of Ver&s;ailles
made this &s;acrifice for the &s;atisfaction of England, the
Marquis de Puy&s;ieux, the French mini&s;ter, ob&s;erved to
the Engli&s;h re&s;ident, that France was undoubtedly in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that i&s;land towards the middle of the la&s;t
century. He ought in candour to have added, that al|though
Louis XIV. made a conque&s;t of this i&s;land from
the Hollanders, during his war with that republick, it was
re&s;tored to them by the treaty of Nimeguen; and &s;ince
that time France could not have the lea&s;t &s;hadow of a
claim to number it among her &s;ettlements. It was be|fore
this an&s;wer could be obtained from the court of
Ver&s;ailles that the motion, of which we have already
taken notice, was made in the Hou&s;e of Commons, re|lating
to the &s;ubject of the neutral i&s;lands; a motion di&s;|couraged
by the court, and defeated by the majority.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. The peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was celebrated
by fire-works, illuminations, and rejoicings, in which
the Engli&s;h, French, and Dutch &s;eemed to di&s;play a
&s;pirit of emulation, in point of ta&s;te and magnificence;
and, in all probability, the&s;e three powers were &s;incerely
plea&s;ed at the ce&s;&s;ation of the war. England enjoyed a
re&s;pite from intolerable &s;upplies, exorbitant in&s;urance,
and interrupted commerce: Holland was delivered from
the brink of a French inva&s;ion; and France had obtained
a breathing time for re-e&s;tabli&s;hing her naval power, for
exerting that &s;pirit of intrigue, by dint of which &s;he hath
often embroiled her neighbours, and for executing plans
of in&s;en&s;ible encroachment, which might prove more ad|vantageous
<PB N="246" REF="254">
than the progre&s;s of open ho&s;tilities. In the
affair of Tobago the French King had manife&s;ted his
inclination to avoid immediate di&s;putes with England;
and had exhibited another proof of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition
in his behaviour to the Prince-Pretender, who had excited
&s;uch a dangerous rebellion in the i&s;land of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. Among tho&s;e princes and powers who ex|cepted
again&s;t different articles of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle,
the Chevalier de St. George, fore&s;eeing that
none of the plenipotentiaries would receive his prote&s;t,
employed his agents to fix it up in the publick places of
Aix-la Chapelle; a precaution of very little &s;ervice to
his cau&s;e, which all the &s;tates of Chri&s;tendom &s;eemed
now to have abandoned. So little was the intere&s;t of
his family con&s;idered in this negociation, that the con|tracting
powers agreed, without re&s;erve, to a literal in|&s;ertion
of the fifth article of the quadruple alliance; by
which it was &s;tipulated, that neither the Pretender nor
any of his de&s;cendants &s;hould be allowed to re&s;ide within
the territories belonging to any of the &s;ub&s;cribing parties.
At the &s;ame time the plenipot entiaries of France promi&s;ed
to tho&s;e of Great-Britain, that Prince Charles-Edward
&s;hould be immediately obliged to quit the dominions of
his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty. Notice of this agreement
was accordingly given by the court of Ver&s;ailles to the
young adventurer; and as he had declared he would ne|ver
return to Italy, Mon&s;. de Courteille, the French
envoy to the cantons of Switzerland, was directed by his
&s;overeign to demand an a&s;ylum for Prince Edward in the
city of Fribourg. The regency having complied in this
particular with the earne&s;t reque&s;t of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
Maje&s;ty, Mr. Burnaby, the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter to the Hel|vetick
Body, took the alarm, and pre&s;ented the magi&s;tracy
of Fribourg with a remon&s;trance, couched in &s;uch terms
as gave offence to that regency, and drew upon him a
&s;evere an&s;wer. In vain had the French King exerted his
influence in procuring this retreat for the young Preten|der,
who, being pre&s;&s;ed with repeated me&s;&s;ages to with|draw,
<PB N="247" REF="255">
per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to quit the place, to which he
had been &s;o cordially invited by his cou&s;in the King of
France; and where he &s;aid that monarch had &s;olemnly
promi&s;ed, on the word of a king, that he would never
for&s;ake him in his di&s;tre&s;s, nor abandon the intere&s;ts of
his family. Louis was not a little perplexed at this ob|&s;tinacy
of Prince Edward, which was the more vexatious,
as that youth appeared to be the darling of the Pari&s;ians;
who not only admired him for his own accompli&s;hments,
and pitied him for his &s;ufferings, but al&s;o revered him, as a
young hero lineally de&s;cended from their renowned Henry
the Fourth. At length, the two Engli&s;h noblemen ar|riving
at Paris, as ho&s;tages for the performance of the
treaty, and &s;eeing him appear at all publick places of
diver&s;ion, complained of this circum&s;tance, as an in&s;ult
to their &s;overeign, and an infringement of the treaty
&s;o lately concluded. The French King, after &s;ome
he&s;itation between punctilio and convenience, re&s;olved to
employ violence upon the per&s;on of this trouble&s;ome
&s;tranger, &s;ince milder remon&s;trances had not been able
to influence his conduct: but this re&s;olution was not
taken till the return of a courier whom he di&s;patched to
the Chevalier de St. George; who, being thus informed
of his &s;on's deportment, wrote a letter to him, laying
&s;trong injunctions upon him, to yield to the nece&s;&s;ity
of the times, and acquie&s;ce with a good grace in the
&s;tipulations which his cou&s;in of France had found it
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub&s;cribe, for the intere&s;t of his realm. Ed|ward,
far from complying with this advice and injunction,
&s;ignified his re&s;olution to remain in Paris; and even de|clared,
that he would pi&s;tol any man who &s;hould pre&s;ume
to lay violent hands on his per&s;on. In con&s;equence
of this bold declaration, an extraordinary council was
held at Ver&s;ailles, when it was determined to arre&s;t him
without further delay, and the whole plan of this enterpri&s;e
was finally adju&s;ted. That &s;ame evening, the Prince en|tering
the narrow lane that leads to the Opera, the bar|rier
was immediately &s;hut, and the &s;erjeant of the guard
<PB N="248" REF="256">
called &startq;To arms,&endq; on which Mon&s;ieur de Vaudreuil,
exempt of the French guards, advancing to Edward,
&startq;Prince (&s;aid he) I arre&s;t you in the King's name, by
virtue of this order.&endq; At that in&s;tant the youth was
&s;urrounded by four grenadiers, in order to prevent any
mi&s;chief he might have done with a ca&s;e of pocket pi&s;tols
which he always carried about him; and a guard was
placed at all the avenues and doors of the Opera-hou&s;e,
$e&s;t any tumult &s;hould have en&s;ued among the populace.
The&s;e precautions being taken, Vaudreuil, with an
e&s;corte, conducted the pri&s;oner through the garden of the
Palais-Royal to a hou&s;e where the Duke de Biron waited
with a coach and &s;ix to convey him to the ca&s;tle of Vin|cennes,
whither he was immediately accompanied by a
detachment from the regiment of French Guards, under
the command of that nobleman. He had not remained
above three days in this confinement when he gave the
French mini&s;try to under&s;tand, that he would conform
him&s;elf to the King's intentions; and was immediately en|larged,
upon giving his word and honour that he would,
without delay, retire from the dominions of France. Ac|cordingly,
he &s;et out in four days from Fontainebleau, at|tended
by three officers, who conducted him as far as Pont-Beauvo&s;in
on the frontiers, where they took their leave of
him, and returned to Ver&s;ailles. He proceeded for &s;ome
time in the road to Chamberri; but &s;oon returned into the
French dominions, and, pa&s;&s;ing through Dauphin&eacute;, re|paired
to Avignon, where he was received with extraordi|nary
honours by the Pope's legate. In the mean time his
arre&s;t excited great murmurings at Paris; the inhabitants
blaming, without &s;cruple, their King's conduct in this
in&s;tance, as a &s;candalous breach of ho&s;pitality, as well as
a mean proof of conde&s;cen&s;ion to the King of England;
and many &s;evere pa&s;quinades, relating to this tran&s;action,
were fixed up in the mo&s;t publick places of that metro|polis.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. Although peace was now re-e&s;tabli&s;hed
among the principal powers of the continent, yet another
<PB N="249" REF="257">
&s;torm &s;eemed ready to bur&s;t upon the northern parts of
Europe, in a fre&s;h rupture between Ru&s;&s;ia and Sweden.
Whether the Czarina had actually obtained information
that the French faction meditated &s;ome revolution of
government at Stockholm, or &s;he wanted a pretence for
annexing Finland to her empire; certain it is, &s;he affected
to apprehend that the prince-&s;ucce&s;&s;or of Sweden waited
only for the decea&s;e of the reigning king, who was very
old and infirm, to change the form of government, and
re&s;ume that ab&s;olute authority which &s;ome of the monarchs
his predece&s;&s;ors had enjoyed. She &s;eemed to think that a
prince thus ve&s;ted with arbitrary power, and guided by the
councils of France and Pru&s;&s;ia, with which Sweden had
lately engaged in clo&s;e alliance, might become a very
trouble&s;ome and dangerous neighbour to her in the
Baltick: &s;he, therefore, recruited her armies, repaired
her fortifications, filled her magazines, ordered a &s;trong
body of troops to advance towards the frontiers of Fin|land,
and declared in plain terms to the court of Stock|holm,
That if any &s;tep &s;hould be taken to alter the
government, which &s;he had bound her&s;elf by treaty to
maintain, her troops &s;hould enter the territory of Sweden,
and &s;he would act up to the &s;pirit of her engagements.
The Swedi&s;h mini&s;try, alarmed at the&s;e peremptory pro|ceedings,
had recour&s;e to their allies; and, in the mean
time, made repeated declarations to the court of Peter&s;|burgh,
That there was no de&s;ign to make the lea&s;t inno|vation
in the nature of their e&s;tabli&s;hed government: but
little or no regard being paid to the&s;e repre&s;entations, they
began to put the kingdom in a po&s;ture of defence; and the
old King gave the Czarina to under&s;tand, That if, not|with&s;tanding
the &s;atisfaction he had offered, her forces
&s;hould pa&s;s the frontiers of Finland, he would con&s;ider
their march as an ho&s;tile inva&s;ion, and employ the means
which God had put in his power for the defence of his
dominions.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. This declaration, in all probability, did not
produce &s;uch effect as the interpo&s;ition of his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty,
<PB N="250" REF="258">
the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing prince of his time, at the head
of one hundred and forty thou&s;and of the be&s;t troops that
Germany ever trained. Perhaps he was not &s;orry that the
Empre&s;s of Mu&s;covy furni&s;hed him with a plau&s;ible pre|tence
for maintaining &s;uch a formidable army, after the
peace of Europe had been a&s;certained by a formal treaty,
and all the &s;urrounding &s;tates had dimini&s;hed the number
of their forces. He now wrote a letter to his uncle the King
of Great-Britain, complaining of the in&s;ults and menaces
which had been offered by the Czarina to Sweden; declar|ing,
that he was bound by a defen&s;ive alliance, to which
France had acceded, to defend the government at pre&s;ent
e&s;tabli&s;hed in Sweden; and that he would not &s;it &s;till, and
tamely &s;ee that kingdom attacked by any power what&s;oever,
without acting up to his engagements: he therefore en|treated
his Britannick Maje&s;ty to interpo&s;e his good offices,
in conjunction with France and him, to compromi&s;e the
di&s;putes which threatened to embroil the northern parts of
Europe. By this time the Ru&s;&s;ian army had approached
the frontiers of Finland: the Swedes had a&s;&s;embled their
troops, repleni&s;hed their magazines, and repaired their
marine; and the King of Denmark, jealous of the Czari|na's
de&s;igns with regard to the duchy of Sle&s;wick, which
was conte&s;ted with him by the prince-&s;ucce&s;&s;or of Ru&s;&s;ia,
kept his army and navy on the mo&s;t re&s;pectable footing.
At this critical juncture the courts of London, Ver&s;ailles,
and Berlin co-operated &s;o effectually by remon&s;trances and
declarations at Peter&s;burgh and Stockholm, that the Em|pre&s;s
of Ru&s;&s;ia thought proper to own her&s;elf &s;atisfied,
and all tho&s;e clouds of trouble were immediately di&s;per&s;|ed.
Yet, in all probability, her real aim was di&s;|appointed;
and, however &s;he might di&s;&s;emble her &s;en|timents,
&s;he never heartily forgave the King of Pru&s;&s;ia
for the &s;hare he had in this tran&s;action. That mo|narch,
without relaxing in his attention to the &s;upport of a
very formidable military power, exerted very extraordinary
endeavours in cultivating the civil intere&s;ts of his country.
He reformed the laws of Brandenburgh, and re&s;cued the
admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice from the frauds of chicanery. He
<PB N="251" REF="259">
encouraged the arts of agriculture and manufacture; and
even laid the foundation of naval commerce, by e&s;tabli&s;hing
an Ea&s;t-India company in the port of Embden.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. Nor did the French mini&s;try neglect any mea|&s;ure
that might contribute to repair the damage which the
kingdom had &s;u&s;tained in the cour&s;e of the war. One half
of the army was di&s;banded: the &s;evere impo&s;ition of the
tenth penny was &s;u&s;pended by the King's edict: a &s;cheme
of oeconomy was propo&s;ed, with re&s;pect to the finances;
and the utmo&s;t diligence u&s;ed in procuring materials, as
well as workmen, for &s;hip-building, that the navy of France
might &s;peedily retrieve its former importance. In the mid&s;t
of the&s;e truely patriotick &s;chemes, the court of Ver&s;ailles be|trayed
a littlene&s;s of genius, and a &s;pirit of tyranny, joined
to fanatici&s;m, in quarrelling with their parliament about &s;u|per&s;titious
forms of religion. The &s;acraments had been
denied to a certain per&s;on on his death-bed, becau&s;e he
refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe to the bull Unigenitus. The nephew
of the defunct preferred a complaint to the parliament,
who&s;e province it was to take cognizance of the affair: a
deputation of that body attended the King with the report
of their re&s;olutions; and his Maje&s;ty commanded them to
&s;u&s;pend all proceedings relating to a matter of &s;uch con&s;e|quence,
concerning which he would take an opportunity
of &s;ignifying his royal plea&s;ure. This interpo&s;ition was
the &s;ource of di&s;putes between the crown and parliament,
which had like to have filled the whole kingdom with in|te&s;tine
troubles.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. At Vienna the Empre&s;s-Queen was not more
&s;ollicitous in promoting the trade and internal manu|factures
of her dominions, by &s;umptuary regulations, ne|ce&s;&s;ary
re&s;trictions on foreign &s;uperfluities, by opening her
ports in the Adriatick, and giving proper encouragement to
commerce, than &s;he was careful and provident in reforming
the oeconomy of her finances, maintaining a re&s;pectable
body of forces, and guarding, by defen&s;ive alliances, again&s;t
the enterpri&s;es of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, on who&s;e military
power &s;he looked with jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t. In Holland
<PB N="252" REF="260">
all the authority and influence of the Stadtholder were
&s;carcely &s;ufficient to allay the ferments excited among the
people, by the provi&s;ional taxation which had &s;ucceeded
the abolition of the pachters, and was indeed very grievous
to the &s;ubject. As this was no more than a temporary ex|pedient,
the Prince of Orange propo&s;ed a more equitable
plan, which was approved by the States, and e&s;tabli&s;hed
with great difficulty. In Italy the &s;y&s;tem of politics &s;eemed
to change its complexion. The King of Sardinia effected
a match between one of the Infantas of Spain and the
Prince of Piedmont; and whether irritated by the conduct
of the Au&s;trians in the la&s;t war, or apprehen&s;ive of &s;uch a
powerful neighbour in the Milane&s;e, he engaged with the
Kings of France and Spain in a defen&s;ive alliance, compre|hending
the King of the Two Sicilies, the republick of
Genoa, and the Dukes of Modena and Parma. His mo&s;t
Catholick Maje&s;ty, &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed to cultivate the arts of
peace, and encourage every mea&s;ure that could contribute
to the advantage of his country, was no &s;ooner relea&s;ed
from the embarra&s;&s;ments of war, then he began to execute
plans of internal oeconomy; to reduce unnece&s;&s;ary pen&s;ions,
di&s;charge the debts contracted in the war, repleni&s;h his
ar&s;enals, augment his navy, promote manufactures, and
encourage an active commerce by &s;ea, the benefits of which
the kingdom of Spain had not known &s;ince the fir&s;t di&s;co|very
and conque&s;t of the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. The preparations for refitting and increa&s;ing
the navy of Spain were carried on with &s;uch extraordinary
vigour, that other nations believed an expedition was in|tended
again&s;t the Cor&s;airs of Algiers, who had for &s;ome
time grievou&s;ly infe&s;ted the trade and coa&s;t of the Mediter|ranean.
The exi&s;tence of this and other predatory repub|licks,
which entirely &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon piracy and rapine, petty
&s;tates of barbarous ruffians, maintained, as it were, in the
mid&s;t of powerful nations, which they in&s;ult with impunity,
and of which they even exact an annual contribution, is a
$lagrant reproach upon Chri&s;tendom; a reproach the great|er,
as it is founded upon a low, &s;elfi&s;h, illiberal maxim of
<PB N="253" REF="261">
policy. All the powers that border on the Mediterranean,
except France and Tu&s;cany, are at perpetual war with the
Moors of Barbary, and, for that rea&s;on, obliged to employ
foreign &s;hips for the tran&s;portation of their merchandi&s;e.
This employment naturally devolves to tho&s;e nations who&s;e
ve&s;&s;els are in no danger from the depredations of the bar|barians;
namely, the &s;ubjects of the Maritime Powers,
who, for this puny advantage, not only tolerate the pirati|cal
&s;tates of Barbary, but even &s;upply them with arms and
ammunition, &s;ollicit their pa&s;&s;es, and purcha&s;e their forbear|ance
with annual pre&s;ents, which are, in effect, equivalent
to a tribute: whereas, by one vigorous exertion of their
power, they might de&s;troy all their &s;hips, lay their towns in
a&s;hes, and totally extirpate tho&s;e pernicious broods of de|&s;perate
banditti. Even all the conde&s;cen&s;ion of tho&s;e who
di&s;grace them&s;elves with the title of allies to the&s;e mi&s;cre|ants
is not always &s;ufficient to re&s;train them from acts of
cruelty and rapine. At this very period four crui&s;ers from
Algiers made a capture of an Engli&s;h packet-boat, in her
voyage from Li&s;bon, and conveyed her to their city, where
&s;he was plundered of money and effects to the amount of
one hundred thou&s;and pounds, and afterwards di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.
In con&s;equence of this outrage, Commodore Keppel was
&s;ent with &s;even &s;hips of war to demand &s;atisfaction, as
well as to compromi&s;e certain differences which had ari&s;en
on account of arrears claimed of the Engli&s;h by the Dey of
Algiers. The Mu&s;&s;ulman frankly owned, that the money
having been divided among the captors could not po&s;&s;ibly
be refunded. The Commodore returned to Gibraltar;
and, in the &s;equel, an Algerine amba&s;&s;ador arrived in Lon|don,
with &s;ome pre&s;ents of wild bea&s;ts for his Britannick
Maje&s;ty. This tran&s;action was &s;ucceeded by another in|jurious
affront, offered by the governor or Alcayde of Te|tuan
to Mr. Latton, an Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, &s;ent thither
to redeem the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, who had been many years
en&s;laved in the dominions of the King of Morocco. A
revolution having lately happened in this empire, Muley
Abdallah, the reigning ru&s;&s;ian, in&s;i&s;ted upon the amba&s;&s;a|dor's
<PB N="254" REF="262">
paying a pretended balance for the ran&s;om of the
captives, as well as depo&s;iting a con&s;iderable &s;um, which
had already been paid to a decea&s;ed ba&s;haw; alledging,
that as he (the Emperor) received no part of it, the pay|ment
was illegal. Mr. Latton refu&s;ing to comply with
this arbitrary demand, his hou&s;e was &s;urrounded by a de|tachment
of &s;oldiers, who violently dragged his &s;ecretary
from his pre&s;ence, and threw him into a di&s;mal &s;ubterranean
dungeon, where he continued twenty days. The Engli&s;h
&s;laves, to the number of twenty-&s;even, were condemned to
the &s;ame fate: the amba&s;&s;ador him&s;elf was degraded from
his character, deprived of his allowance, and &s;eque&s;tered
from all communication. All the letters directed to him were
intercepted, and interpreted to the Alcayde: two negro
porters were entru&s;ted with the keys of all his apartments,
and a couple of &s;oldiers po&s;ted at his chamber-door: nay,
this Moori&s;h governor threatened to load him with irons,
and violently &s;ei&s;ed part of the pre&s;ents de&s;igned by his
Britannick Maje&s;ty for the Emperor. At length, finding
that neither Mr. Latton nor the governor of Gibraltar, to
whom he had written, would depo&s;it the money, without
fre&s;h in&s;tructions from the Court of London, the barbarian
thought proper to relax in his &s;everity: the pri&s;oners were
enlarged, the re&s;trictions removed from the per&s;on of the
amba&s;&s;ador, and, after all the&s;e indignities offered to the
honour of the Briti&s;h nation, the balance was paid, and
the affair quietly adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. Britain, in the mean while, was altogether
barren of events which might de&s;erve a place in a general
hi&s;tory. Commerce and manufacture flouri&s;hed again, to
&s;uch a degree of increa&s;e as had never been known in the
i&s;land: but this advantage was attended with an irre&s;i&s;tible
tide of luxury and exce&s;s, which flowed through all degrees
of the people, breaking down all the mounds of civil po|lity,
and opening a way for licen&s;e and immorality. The
highways were in&s;e&s;ted with rap$$e and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; the
cities teemed with the brutal votaries of $ewdne&s;s, intemper|ance,
and pro&s;ligacy. The whole land was over&s;pread
<PB N="255" REF="263">
with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of tumult, riot, and in&s;urrection, excited
in different parts of the kingdom by the erection of new
turnpikes, which the legi&s;lature judged nece&s;&s;ary for the
convenience of inland carriage. In order to quell the&s;e
di&s;turbance, recour&s;e was had to the military power: &s;e|veral
individuals were &s;lain, and &s;ome were executed as
examples.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. In the month of November the &s;e&s;&s;ion of par|liament
was opened with a &s;peech from the throne, in
which his Maje&s;ty expre&s;&s;ed a particular plea&s;ure in meeting
them at a time when the perfect re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of a
general peace had re&s;tored to his people the ble&s;&s;ings of quiet
and tranquility. He &s;aid, the good effects of the&s;e already
appeared in the flouri&s;hing condition of national commerce,
and in the ri&s;e of publick credit, which were the foundations
of &s;trength and pro&s;perity to the&s;e kingdoms. He declared,
That, during the &s;ummer, he had u&s;ed every opportunity of
cementing and &s;ecuring the peace: That it was his firm
re&s;olution to do every thing in his power for the pre&s;ervation
of it, and religiou&s;ly adhere to the engagements into which
he had entered. Finally, he took notice of the good di&s;po|&s;ition
he had found in the other contracting parties to the
treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle to cheri&s;h the public tranquillity
of Europe: and he earne&s;tly recommended to the two
Hou&s;es the maintenance of a &s;trong naval power, as the
bulwark of national &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. When the motion was made for an addre&s;s of
thanks in the Hou&s;e of Commons, the fir&s;t paragraph of his
Maje&s;ty's &s;peech furni&s;hed the oppo&s;ition with a handle to
declaim again&s;t the late treaty. Sir John Hynde Cotton
ob&s;erved, That the peace could not be properly &s;tiled com|plete,
as nothing had been &s;tipulated with re&s;pect to the
article of &startq;no &s;earch;&endq; alluding to the interruption our
commerce had &s;u&s;tained from the Spaniards in the We&s;t-Indies:
a &s;tipulation, without which both Hou&s;es of
parliament had formerly voted that there &s;hould be no peace
with that kingdom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1749.</NOTE> In the pre&s;ent conjuncture of affairs,
&s;uch an objection favoured rather of party than of pa|trioti&s;m;
<PB N="256" REF="264">
and indeed Sir John declared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1749.</NOTE> that the remarks
he made upon the occa&s;ion were rather in di&s;charge of the
duty he owed to his country, than in hope of &s;eeing his
&s;entiments e&s;pou&s;ed by the majority. Some &s;harp alterca|tion
was u&s;ed in the debate which aro&s;e on this &s;ubject;
and many &s;evere invectives were levelled at tho&s;e who ne|gociated,
as well as at tho&s;e who approved and confirmed
the treaty. But Mr. Pelham, who &s;u&s;tained the whole
weight of the debate on the &s;ide of admini&s;tration, an&s;wered
every objection with equal candour and ability; and if he
failed in proving that the terms of peace were as favourable
as could be expected, con&s;idering the unfortunate events of
the war, and the &s;ituation of the contending powers; he at
lea&s;t demon&s;trated, that it would be the intere&s;t of the king|dom
to acquie&s;ce for the pre&s;ent in the treaty which had
been concluded, and endeavour to remedy its imperfections
by &s;ub&s;equent conventions, amicably opened among tho&s;e
powers between whom any cau&s;e of di&s;pute remained.
With re&s;pect to the vote of both hou&s;es, mentioned by
Sir John Hynde Cotton, he declared that he had never
approved of that &s;tep, when it was fir&s;t taken; or if he
had, times and circum&s;tances, which could not be fore&s;een,
would have ju&s;tified his deviating from it in the re-e&s;tab|li&s;hment
of peace. He reminded them, that a parliament
of Great-Britain had once voted &startq;no peace while any
part of the We&s;t-Indies &s;hould remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
Spani&s;h King;&endq; yet a train of incidents, which they could
not po&s;&s;ibly fore&s;ee, afterwards rendered it expedient to
adopt a peace, without in&s;i&s;ting upon the accompli&s;hment
of that condition. In a word, he mu&s;t own, that, in the
majority of debates excited in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the
mini&s;try derived their triumphs from the force of rea&s;on,
as well as from the weight of influence. We &s;hall always,
however, except the efforts that were made for reducing
the number of land forces to fifteen thou&s;and, and main|taining
a greater number of &s;eamen than the mini&s;try pro|po&s;ed.
On the&s;e con&s;titutional points the Earl of Egmont,
and the other chiefs of the oppo&s;ition, expatiated with all
<PB N="257" REF="265">
the energy of eloquence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1749.</NOTE> which, however, was fru&s;trated
by the power of &s;uperior number. Ten thou&s;and &s;eamen
were voted for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, notwith|&s;tanding
his Maje&s;ty's injunction to maintain a con&s;iderable
navy; and the number of land-forces was continued at
eighteen thou&s;and eight hundred and fifty-&s;even. The
&s;ums granted for making good his Maje&s;ty's engagements
with the Electors of Bavaria and Mentz, and the Duke of
Brun&s;wick Wolfenbuttel, amounted to fifty three thou&s;and
two hundred and twenty-five pounds &s;terling. The &s;er|vices
done by the colonies in North-America, during the
war, were gratified with the &s;um of one hundred twenty-two
thou&s;and two hundred forty-&s;ix pounds. The expen&s;e
incurred by the new colony of Nova-Scotia exceeded
&s;eventy-&s;ix thou&s;and pounds. A &s;mall &s;um was voted for
the improvement of Georgia; and ten thou&s;and pounds
were granted towards the &s;upport of the Briti&s;h forts and
&s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Africa. The &s;um total granted
in this &s;e&s;&s;ion aro&s;e to four millions one hundred forty one
thou&s;and &s;ix hundred &s;ixty-one pounds, nine &s;hillings, and
eleven pence half-penny, to be rai&s;ed by the land tax, at
three &s;hillings in the pound; the malt, and other duties, the
&s;urplus of divers impo&s;itions remaining in the Bank and
Exchequer: one million by annuities, at three per cent.
charged on the &s;inking fund, until redeemed by parliament;
and nine hundred thou&s;and pounds out of the exce&s;s or
overplus of monies denominated the &s;inking fund.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. But the capital mea&s;ure which di&s;tingui&s;hed
this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was the reduction of the intere&s;t
on the publick funds; a &s;cheme which was planned and
executed by the mini&s;ter, without any national di&s;turbance
or di&s;quiet, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all Europe; the different
nations of which could not comprehend how it would be
po&s;&s;ible for the government, at the clo&s;e of a long expen&s;ive
war, which had &s;o con&s;iderably drained the country, and
augmented the enormous burthen of national debt, to find
money for paying off &s;uch of the publick creditors as might
choo&s;e to receive their principal, rather than &s;ubmit to a
<PB N="258" REF="266">
reduction of the intere&s;t. It was not very much for the
honour of the oppo&s;ition, that &s;ome of its leading members
endeavoured to impede this great machine of civil oeco|nomy,
by taking opportunities of affirming in parliament,
in oppo&s;ition to his Maje&s;ty's &s;peech, that the nation, far
from being in a flouri&s;hing condition, was almo&s;t entirely
exhau&s;ted; that commerce drooped and declined; that
publick credit &s;tood tottering on the brink of ruin; and that
all the treaties lately concluded among the different powers
of Europe were, in effect, di&s;advantageous and prejudicial
to the intere&s;ts of Great-Britain. In an&s;wer to the&s;e a&s;&s;er|tions,
Mr. Pelham undertook to prove, from the regi&s;ter
of exports and imports, that the commerce of the kingdom
was more exten&s;ive at this than at any former period; and
that the publick credit was &s;trong enough to admit of an
experiment, which he would not pre&s;ume to hazard, ex|cept
upon a moral certainty of its being firmly rooted, be|yond
the power of accident and faction to &s;hake or over|turn.
He declared, that his de&s;ign of reducing the intere&s;t
upon the funds was the re&s;ult of the love he bore his coun|try,
and an opinion that it was the duty of the &s;ervants of
the crown to ea&s;e the burthens of the people. He &s;aid, he
had conferred on this &s;ubject with per&s;ons of the mo&s;t ap|proved
knowledge, and undoubted experience; and cho&s;e
to promulgate the method propo&s;ed for alleviating the load
of the national debt, that the public, in knowing the parti|culars
of the &s;cheme, might have time to con&s;ider them at
lei&s;ure, and &s;tart &s;uch objections as &s;hould occur to their
reflexion, before it might be too late to adopt amendments.
He ob&s;erved, that nothing could more clearly demon&s;trate
the vigour of public credit, and the augmentation of national
commerce, than the price of &s;tock, which had within three
years ri&s;en to a very con&s;iderable increa&s;e; and the duties
on imports, which in nine months had added one million to
the &s;inking fund, notwith&s;tanding a very extraordinary
&s;um which had been paid as bounties for exported corn.
He expre&s;&s;ed great tenderne&s;s and regard for the intere&s;ts of
tho&s;e who had advanced their money for the &s;ervice of the
<PB N="259" REF="267">
government; declaring, that his aim was to contrive a fair,
hone&s;t, and equitable method for le&s;&s;ening the national
incumbrances, by lowering the intere&s;t, conformable to
parliamentary faith, and agreeable to the rules of eternal
ju&s;tice. His plan was accordingly communicated, can|va&s;&s;ed,
and approved in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and an
act pa&s;&s;ed for reducing the intere&s;t of the funds which con|&s;titute
the national debt<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The re&s;olutions of the Commons on this head were printed by authority in the London-Gazette, &s;ignifying, That tho&s;e who were, or &s;hould be, pro|prietors of any part of the publick debt, redeemable by law, incurred before Michaelmas, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and forty nine, carrying an intere&s;t of four per centum per annum, who &s;hould, on or before the twen|ty-eighth day of February in that year, &s;ub&s;cribe their names, &s;ignifying their con&s;ent to accept of an intere&s;t of three pounds per centum, to com|mence from the twenty-fifth day of December, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;even, &s;ubject to the &s;ame provi&s;ions, notices, and clau&s;es of redemption to which their re&s;pective &s;ums at four per centum were then liable &s;hould, in lieu of their pre&s;ent intere&s;t, be entitled to four per centum till the twenty-fifth day of December in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty; and after that day, to three pounds ten &s;hillings per centum per annum, till the twenty-fifth Day of December one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;even; and no part of that debt, except what was due to the Ea&s;t-India company, &s;hould be redeemable to this period: That if any part of the na|tional debt, incurred before la&s;t Michaelmas, redeemable by law, and carry|ing an intere&s;t of four per centum, &s;hould remain un&s;ub&s;cribed on or before the thirtieth day of May, the government &s;hould pay off the principal. For this purpo&s;e his Maje&s;ty was enabled to borrow of any per&s;on or per&s;ons, bodies politic or corporate, any &s;um or &s;ums of money not exceeding that part of the national debt which might remain un&s;ub&s;cribed, to be charged on the &s;inking fund, upon any terms not exceeding the rate of intere&s;t in the foregoing propo&s;al.</P>
<P>All the duties appropriated to the payment of the intere&s;t were &s;till con|tinued, and the &s;urplus of the&s;e incorporated with the &s;inking fund for the di&s;charge of the principal.

In pur&s;uance of this act, for
the reduction of the intere&s;t, the greater part of the credi|tors
complied with the terms propo&s;ed, and &s;ub&s;cribed their
re&s;pective annuities before the end of February; but the
three great companies at fir&s;t kept aloof, and refu&s;ed to
&s;ub&s;cribe any part of their capital.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> About the middle of March the Commons
ordered the proper officers to lay before them an account of
<PB N="260" REF="268">
the &s;ums which had been &s;ub&s;cribed, and the&s;e were taken
into con&s;ideration by a committee of the whole Hou&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1750.</NOTE> It
was then that Mr. Pelham, as chancellor of the Exche|quer,
ob&s;erved, That, be&s;ides the debts due to the three
great companies in their corporate capacity, all the re&s;t,
carrying four per centum intere&s;t, had been &s;ub&s;cribed, ex|cept
about eight or nine millions, the proprietors of which
had forfeited the favour de&s;igned them by parliament: but
as many of the&s;e had been mi&s;$ed by evil coun&s;ellors, who
perhaps were more intent on di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the government,
than &s;ollicitous to &s;erve their friends; and as many were
foreigners, re&s;iding beyond &s;ea, who had not time to take
proper advice, and give the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions; and as
the&s;e could not po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;tingui&s;hed from &s;uch as re|fu&s;ed
to &s;ub&s;cribe from mere ob&s;tinacy or di&s;affection, it
might be thought cruel to take the mo&s;t rigorous advantage
of the forfeiture they had incurred. With re&s;pect to the
proprietors of the &s;tock or capital belonging to the three
great companies, he a&s;&s;erted, that many of them would
willingly have &s;ub&s;cribed their properties within the time
limited, but were nece&s;&s;arily excluded by the majority on
the ballot; and as it was equally impo&s;&s;ible to know tho&s;e
who were again&s;t the que&s;tion on the ballot, he thought
that &s;ome tenderne&s;s was due even to the proprietors of
tho&s;e three companies: his opinion, therefore, was, that
they and the uncomplying annuitants &s;hould be indulged
with further time to complete their &s;ub&s;cription; but, in
order to pre&s;erve the authority of parliament, and the re|&s;pect
due to that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, they ought not to be
gratified with &s;uch advantageous terms as were allowed to
the annuitants who at fir&s;t chearfully complied with the
propo&s;als offered by the legi&s;lature. For the&s;e rea&s;ons he
propo&s;ed, That although the term of &s;ub&s;cribing &s;hould
be protracted till the thirtieth day of May, the encourage|ment
of three pounds ten &s;hillings per centum per annum
&s;hould not be continued to the &s;econd &s;ub&s;cribers longer
than till the fifth day of December, in the year one thou|&s;and
&s;even hundred and fifty-five. The propo&s;al being
<PB N="261" REF="269">
approved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1750.</NOTE> a bill was framed for this purpo&s;e, as well as for
redeeming &s;uch annuities as &s;hould not be &s;ub&s;cribed,
which pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es, and was enacted into a
law, after having received an additional clau&s;e, empowering
the Ea&s;t-India Company, in ca&s;e they &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe all
their &s;tock bearing an intere&s;t of four per centum, to bor|row,
with the con&s;ent of the Trea&s;ury, any &s;ums not ex|ceeding
four millions two hundred thou&s;and pounds, after
the &s;everal rates of intere&s;t before propo&s;ed to be paid by the
publick, and one million more at three per centum per
annum. They were al&s;o ve&s;ted with a power to rai&s;e mo|ney
by bonds, as formerly; yet &s;o as the whole, including
the annuities, &s;hould not exceed what they were by former
acts empowered to borrow. The objections to the execu|tion
of this project, which by many were deemed infur|mountable,
entirely vani&s;hed before the fortitude, per&s;e|verance,
and caution of the mini&s;ter; who had &s;ecured,
among the moneyed men of the nation, the promi&s;e of
&s;uch &s;ums as would have been &s;ufficient to pay off the
capital belonging to tho&s;e creditors who might refu&s;e to
accept the intere&s;t thus reduced. The &s;econd &s;ub&s;cription
had the de&s;ired effect. The three great companies acquie&s;c|ed,
and their example was followed by the other &s;crupulous
annuitants: the national burthen was comfortably light|ened,
and the &s;inking fund con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, without
producing the lea&s;t perplexity or di&s;turbance in the com|monwealth;
a circum&s;tance that could not fail to excite
the admiration and envy of all Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. The mutiny-bill for the en&s;uing year was
mitigated with an e&s;&s;ential alteration, relating to the oath
of &s;ecre&s;y impo&s;ed upon the members of every court|martial,
who were now relea&s;ed from this re&s;erve if re|quired
to give evidence, by due cour&s;e of law, in any court
of judicature; and whereas, by the former mutiny-bill, a
general was empowered to order the revi&s;al of any &s;entence
by a court-martial as often as he plea&s;ed, and, on that
pretence, to keep in confinement a man who had been
acquitted upon a fair trial, it was now enacted, That no
<PB N="262" REF="270">
&s;entence pronounced by any court-martial, and &s;igned by
the pre&s;ident, &s;hould be more than once liable to revi&s;al.
Colonel George Town&s;hend, &s;on of Lord Vi&s;count
Town&s;hend, who had equally di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his
civil and military accompli&s;hments, propo&s;ed another
clau&s;e, for preventing any non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer's being
broke, or reduced into the ranks; or any &s;oldier's being
puni&s;hed, but by the &s;entence of a court-martial. He gave
the Hou&s;e to under&s;tand, that certain per&s;ons attended at
the door, who from the &s;tation of non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers
had been broke, and reduced into the ranks, without trial,
or any cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned; and he expatiated not only upon
the iniquity of &s;uch proceedings, but al&s;o upon the danger
of leaving &s;uch arbitrary power in the hands of any indi|vidual
officer. A warm debate was the con&s;equence of
this motion, which, however, was over-ruled by the
majority.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. Among other regulations made in the cour&s;e
of this &s;e&s;&s;ion for the encouragement of the Briti&s;h manu|factures,
a large duty was laid upon Iri&s;h &s;ail-cloth, which,
being &s;old at an under price, was found to interfere with
the &s;ame &s;pecies of commodity fabricated in the i&s;land of
Great-Britain; and, for the further benefit of this la&s;t, the
bounty upon the exportation of it, which had been de|ducted
from a defective fund, was now made payable out
of the Cu&s;toms. This mea&s;ure, however, was not of &s;uch
importance to the nation as the act which they pa&s;&s;ed for
encouraging the importation of pig and bar iron from the
Briti&s;h colonies in North-America. Every well-wi&s;her to
his country reflected with concern on the nature of the
Briti&s;h trade with Sweden, from which kingdom the &s;ub|jects
of his Britannick Maje&s;ty imported more iron and
&s;teel than all the other countries in Europe. For this ar|ticle
they paid a very great balance in ready money, which
the Swedes again expended in purcha&s;ing from the French,
and other mercantile powers, tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries and &s;uper|$luities
with which they might have been as cheaply fur|ni&s;hed
by Great Britain. In the mean time, the Engli&s;h
<PB N="263" REF="271">
colonies in America were re&s;tricted by &s;evere duties from
making advantage of their own produce, in exchanging
their iron for &s;uch commodities as they were under the
nece&s;&s;ity of procuring from their mother-country. Such
re&s;triction was not only a cruel grievance upon our own
&s;ettlements, but al&s;o attended with manife&s;t prejudice to
the intere&s;t of Great-Britain, annually drained of great
&s;ums, in favour of an ungrateful nation, from which no
part of them returned; whereas the iron imported from
America mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity come in exchange for our own
manufactures. The Commons having appointed a day
for taking this affair into con&s;ideration, carefully examined
into the &s;tate of the Briti&s;h commerce carried on with
Sweden, as well as into the accounts of iron imported from
the plantations in America; and a committee of the whole
Hou&s;e having re&s;olved, that the duties on American pig
and bar iron &s;hould be removed, a bill<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance attending the progre&s;s of this bill which made its way through both Hou&s;es, and obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent, was the number of contradictory petitions in favour and in prejudice of it, while it remained under con&s;ideration. The tanners of leather in and about the town of Sheffield, in York&s;hire, repre&s;ented, That if the bill &s;hould pa&s;s, the Engli&s;h iron would be under&s;old; con&s;equently a great number of furnaces and forge$ would be di&s;continued: in that ca&s;$ the woods u&s;ed for fuel would &s;tand uncut, and the tanners be deprived of oak-bark &s;ufficient for the continuance and &s;upport of their occupation. They neverthele&s;s owned, that &s;hould the duty be removed from pig iron only, no &s;uch con&s;equence could be apprehended; becau&s;e, &s;hould the number of furnaces be le&s;&s;ened, that of forges would be increa&s;ed. This was likewi&s;e the plea urged in divers remon&s;trances by ma&s;ters of iron|works, gentlemen, and free holders, who had tracts of wood-land in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The owners, proprietors, and farmers of furnaces and iron-for|ges, belonging to Sheffield and its neighbourhood, enlarged upon the great expen&s;e they had incurred in erecting and &s;upporting iron-works, by means of which great numbers of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects were comfortably &s;up|ported. They expre&s;&s;ed their apprehen&s;ion, that &s;hould the bill pa&s;s into a law, it could not in any degree le&s;&s;en the con&s;umption of Swedi&s;h iron, which was u&s;ed for purpo&s;es which neither the American nor Briti&s;h iron would an&s;wer: but that the propo&s;ed encouragement, con&s;idering the plenty and cheapne&s;s of wood in America, would enable the colonies to under&s;ell the Briti&s;h iron, a branch of traffick which would be totally de|&s;troyed, to the ruin of many thou&s;and labourers, who would be compelled to &s;eek their livelihood in foreign countries. They likewi&s;e &s;ugge&s;ted, that if all the iron manufacturers of Great Britain &s;hould be obliged to depend upon a &s;upply of iron from the plantations, which mu&s;t ever be rendered precarious by the hazard of the &s;eas and the enemy, the manufactures would probably decay for want of materials, and many thou&s;and families be reduced to want and mi&s;ery. On the other hand, the ironmongers and &s;miths belonging to the flouri&s;hing town of Birmingham, in Warwick|&s;hire, pre&s;ented a petition, declaring, That the bill would be of great be|nefit to the trade of the nation, as it would enable the coloni&s;ts to make larger returns of their own produce, and encourage them to take a greater quantity of the Briti&s;h manufactures. They affirmed, that all the iron works in the i&s;land of Great-Britain did not &s;upply half that quantity of that metal &s;ufficient to carry on the manufacture; that if this deficiency could be &s;upplied from the colonies in America, the importation would cea&s;e, and con&s;iderable &s;ums of money be &s;aved to the nation. They ob|&s;erved, that the importation of iron from America could no more affect the iron-works and freeholders of the kingdom than the like quantity im|ported from any other country; but they prayed that the people of Ame|rica might be re&s;trained from erecting &s;litting or rolling mills, or forges for plating iron, as they would interfere with the manufactures of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>Many remon&s;trances to the &s;ame effect were pre&s;ented from different parts of the kingdom; and it appeared, upon the mo&s;t exact enquiry, that the encouragement of American iron would prove extremely beneficial to the kingdom, as it had been found, upon trial, applicable to all the u&s;es of Swedi&s;h iron, and as good in every re&s;pect as the produce of that country.</P></NOTE> was brought in
<PB N="264" REF="272">
for that purpo&s;e, containing a clau&s;e, however, to prevent
his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects from making &s;teel, and e&s;tabli&s;hing
mills for &s;litting and rolling iron within the Briti&s;h colo|nies
of America; this precaution being taken, that the co|loni&s;ts
might not interfere with the manufactures of their
mother-country.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. The next commercial improvement, of
which we &s;hall take notice, was the bill for the encourage|ment
of the Briti&s;h white-herring and cod fi&s;heries. This
was likewi&s;e the re&s;ult of mature deliberation, importing,
That a bounty of thirty &s;hillings per ton &s;hould be granted,
and paid out of the cu&s;toms, to all new ve&s;&s;els from
twenty to four&s;core tons burthen, which &s;hould be built
for that purpo&s;e, and actually employed in the fi&s;hery:
That a &s;ociety &s;hould be incorporated, under the name of
the Free Briti&s;h Fi&s;hery, by a charter, not exclu&s;ive, with
power to rai&s;e a capital not exceeding five hundred thou|&s;and
pounds; and that three pounds ten &s;hillings per
centum per annum &s;hould be granted and paid out of the
<PB N="265" REF="273">
Cu&s;toms to the proprietors for fourteen years, for &s;o much
of the capital as &s;hould be actually employed in the &s;aid
fi&s;heries. Corre&s;ponding chambers were propo&s;ed to be
erected in remote parts of North-Britain, for taking in &s;ub|&s;criptions,
and pro&s;ecuting the trade, under the directions
of the company at London; and the nation in general
&s;eemed eager to di&s;pute this branch of commerce with the
&s;ubjects of Holland, whom they con&s;idered as ungrateful
interlopers. In the Hou&s;e of Peers, however, the bill$
met with a formidable oppo&s;ition from the Earl of Win|$chel&s;ea
and Lord Sandys, who ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, That it
was a crude, indige&s;ted &s;cheme, which, in the execution,
would never an&s;wer the expectations of the people: That
in contending with the Dutch, who are the patterns of
unwearied indu&s;try, and the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy, nothing
could be more ab&s;urd than a joint-&s;tock company, which
is always clogged with extraordinary expen&s;e; and the
re&s;olution of fitting out ve&s;&s;els at the port of London,
where all &s;orts of materials, labour, and &s;eamen are &s;o much
dearer than in any other part of the united kingdom, ex|clu&s;ive
of the great di&s;tance and dangerous voyage between
the metropolis and the Sound of Bra&s;&s;a, in She4land, the
$endezvous at which all the herring-bu&s;&s;es were to a&s;&s;emble
in the beginning of the fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;on. They likewi&s;e
$ook notice of the heavy duty on &s;alt, u&s;ed in curing the
fi&s;h for &s;ale, and the beef for provi&s;ion to the mariners; a
circum&s;tance of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to di&s;courage adventurers
from embarking in a commerce which, at be&s;t, yields but
very &s;lender profits to the trader in particular, how in|portant
&s;oever it might prove to the community in general.
The&s;e objections were an&s;wered by the Duke of Argyle
and the Earl of Granville, who &s;eemed to think that this
branch of trade could not be fairly &s;et on foot, without &s;uch
a con&s;iderable &s;um of money as no &s;ingle individual would
$are to advance; that a joint-&s;tock company would be able
to pro&s;ecute the fi&s;hery at a &s;maller expen&s;e than that which
particular traders mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily incur; that the pre&s;ent
&s;pirit of the nation, which was eagerly bent upon trying
<PB N="266" REF="274">
the experiment, ought not to be baulked by delay, le&s;t it
&s;hould evaporate; and that though the plan was not un|exceptionable,
the defects of it might in the &s;equel be re|medied
by the legi&s;lature. In a word, the bill was adopted
by the majority, with a &s;mall amendment in the title,
which produced &s;ome di&s;quiets in the Lower-Hou&s;e: but
this di&s;pute was compromi&s;ed, and it was enacted into a
law towards the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. Nothing could be
more agreeable to the publick than the &s;anction of the
legi&s;lature to this favourite plan, which was ardently pro|moted,
and patroni&s;ed by men of the greate&s;t eminence for
wealth and popularity. The company cho&s;e for their
governour the Prince of Wales, who received this proof
of their attachment and re&s;pect with particular marks of
&s;atisfaction: the pre&s;ident and vice-pre&s;ident were both
aldermen of London; and the council was compo&s;ed of
thirty gentlemen, the majority of whom were members of
parliament. Great pains were taken, and &s;ome artifice
was u&s;ed, to learn the Dutch method of curing the fi&s;h
People crowded with their &s;ub&s;criptions; a number of
hands were employed in building and equipping the bu&s;&s;e
of ve&s;&s;els u&s;ed in the fi&s;hery; and the mo&s;t favourable con|&s;equences
were expected from the general vigour and
alacrity which animated the&s;e preparations. But th$
&s;ucce&s;s did not gratify the &s;anguine hopes of the projector
and adventurers. The objections made in the Hou&s;e o$
Lords &s;oon appeared to have been well founded: the&s;$
co-operating with mi&s;management in the directors, th$
&s;pirit of the company began to flag, the natural con&s;e|quences
of commercial di&s;appointment, and now the
Briti&s;h fi&s;hery &s;eems to langui&s;h under the neglect of th$
legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. Touching the trade to the coa&s;t of Afric$
petitions were renewed by the company and its creditor
the merchants of Bri&s;tol, Liverpool, and Lanca&s;ter; an
a remon&s;trance was pre&s;ented by the planters and merchant
intere&s;ted in the Briti&s;h &s;ugar &s;ettlements in America: be
the Commons adhered to their former re&s;olutions of layin
<PB N="267" REF="275">
open the trade, maintaining the forts at the publick ex|pen&s;e,
and regulating the commerce by a committee of
merchants, repre&s;enting the chief trading towns in the
kingdom, to be &s;uperintended by the board of trade and
plantations. The bill was accordingly framed and pre|&s;ented,
and having proceeded through both Hou&s;es with|out
oppo&s;ition, obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent. Over and above
$he&s;e wi&s;e, &s;alutary, and patriotick mea&s;ures for the im|provement
of commerce, they encouraged the importation
of raw &s;ilk by an act, reducing the duties formerly pay|able
on that which was the growth of China to the &s;ame
that is rai&s;ed on the raw &s;ilk from Italy, and allowing the
&s;ame drawback upon the exportation of the one which had
been u&s;ually granted on the other. A &s;econd bill was
brought in for the encouragement of the growth and culture
of &s;ilk in Carolina and Georgia, where it had been lately
produced with extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s, by freeing from all
$uties that which &s;hould be imported from his Maje&s;ty's
dominions in America: and a third was framed, permit|ing
raw &s;ilk of the growth or produce of Per&s;ia, purcha&s;ed
a Ru&s;&s;ia, to be imported into Great-Britain, from any
port or place belonging to the empire of Ru&s;&s;ia. Divers
efforts were made, by different members in the oppo&s;ition,
$word$ rectify certain abu&s;es in the army and admini&s;tration:
&s;ome bills were brought in, and &s;everal petitions were
left on the table; but all of them proved abortive, from
the power and influence of the mini&s;ter, who &s;eemed re|&s;olved
that no benefit &s;hould flow upon the nation through
any channel but his own. Neverthele&s;s, it mu&s;t be
acknowledged, for the honour of his memory, that there
is no &s;e&s;&s;ion on record &s;o productive as this was of mea|&s;ures
advantageous to the community.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The people, however, were not entirely
&s;atisfied with the conduct of the admini&s;tration, if we
may judge from the ferment and commotions rai&s;ed during
the progre&s;s of an election for a citizen to repre&s;ent the
city of We&s;tmin&s;ter in parliament. The &s;eat which had
been filled by Lord Trentham, elde&s;t &s;on of Earl Gower,
<PB N="268" REF="276">
having become vacant, in con&s;equence of that nobleman's
accepting a place at the board of Admiralty, he again de|clared
him&s;elf a candidate, and met with a violent oppo|&s;ition.
Tho&s;e who &s;tiled them&s;elves the independent
electors of We&s;tmin&s;ter, being now incen&s;ed to an un|common
degree of turbulence by the interpo&s;ition of mini|&s;terial
influence, determined to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavour;
to baffle the de&s;igns of the court, and at the &s;ame time
take vengeance on the family of Earl Gower, who had
entirely abandoned the oppo&s;ition, of which he was
formerly one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable leaders. With this
view they held con&s;uitations, agreed to re&s;olutions, and
&s;et up a private gentleman, named Sir George Vandeput,
as the competitor of Lord Trentham, declaring that they
would &s;upport his preten&s;ions at their own expen&s;e, being
the more encouraged to this enterpri&s;e by the countenance
and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Prince of Wales and his adherents.
They accordingly opened hou&s;es of entertainment for their
parti&s;ans, &s;ollicited votes, circulated remon&s;trances, and
propagated abu&s;e: in a word, they canva&s;&s;ed, with &s;ur|pri&s;ing
&s;pirit and per&s;everance, again&s;t the whole intere&s;t
of St. James's. Mobs were hired and proce&s;&s;ions made
on both &s;ides, and the city of We&s;tmin&s;ter was filled with
tumult and uproar. The mutual animo&s;ity of the parties
&s;eemed every day to increa&s;e during the election, and a
great number of unqualified votes were pre&s;ented on both
&s;ides: all the powers of in&s;inuation, obloquy, and ridi|cule
were employed to vilify and depreciate both candi|dates.
At length the poll being clo&s;ed, a majority of
votes appeared in behalf of Lord Trentham: but a &s;crutiny
being demanded by the other &s;ide, the returning office
complied with their reque&s;t. The Speaker of the Lower
Hou&s;e had i&s;&s;ued his warrant for a new writ of election
about the middle of November; and towards the end of
February Mr. Fox, &s;ecretary at war, &s;tanding up, and
ob&s;erving that no return had yet been made, though
proper to move, That the clerk of the crown, the me&s;|&s;enger
extraordinary attending the great &s;eal, the under
<PB N="269" REF="277">
&s;heriff of Middle&s;ex, and the high-bailiff of We&s;tmin&s;ter,
&s;hould attend next morning, and give an account of their
i&s;&s;uing, delivering, and executing the writ of election.
The&s;e being examined, and the high-bailiff declaring that
he would proceed with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch in the &s;crutiny,
which had been demanded and was begun, Mr. Speaker
explained to him &s;ome particulars of his duty; in the
di&s;charge of which, he was given to under&s;tand he might
depend upon the protection of the Hou&s;e, &s;hould he meet
with any ob&s;truction which he could not otherwi&s;e &s;ur|mount.
By the violence and caprice with which a great
number of votes were conte&s;ted on both &s;ides, the &s;crutiny
was protracted a long time, and the return attended with
&s;ome extraordinary con&s;equences, which &s;hall be particular|$&s;ed
among the tran&s;actions of the next year. In the mean
time, the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was clo&s;ed on the
twelfth day of April, with a &s;peech from the throne, com|mending
the Commons for having &s;ei&s;ed the very fir&s;t
opportunity of reducing the intere&s;t of the national debt,
without the lea&s;t infringement upon the faith of parliament;
and congratulating them on the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the
publick credit, which could not fail to add &s;trength and
reputation to the government, both at home and abroad.
Immediately after the ri&s;ing of the parliament his Maje&s;ty
appointed a regency to govern the kingdom in his ab&s;ence,
and embarked for the continent, in order to vi&s;it his
German dominions.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The month of January and the beginning
of February were di&s;tingui&s;hed, the fir&s;t by a very remark|able
Aurora Borealis, appearing at night to the north-ea&s;t,
of a deep and du&s;ky red colour, like the reflexion of
&s;ome great fire, for which it was by many people mi&s;taken;
and the corru&s;cations, unlike tho&s;e that are generally
ob&s;erved, did not meet in the zenith, but in a point &s;ome
$egrees to the &s;outhward. February was u&s;hered in by
$errible peals of thunder, fla&s;hes of lightning, and &s;uch a
tempe&s;t of wind, hail, and rain, as overwhelmed with
$ear and con&s;ternation the inhabitants of Bri&s;tol, where
<PB N="270" REF="278">
it chiefly raged. On the eighth day of the &s;ame month,
between twelve and one in the afternoon, the people of
London were &s;till more dreadfully alarmed by the &s;hock
of an earthquake, which &s;hook all the hou&s;es with &s;uch
violence, that the furniture rocked on the floors, the
pewter and porcelaine rattled on the &s;helves, the chamber
bells rang, and the whole of this commotion was attended
with a clap or noi&s;e re&s;embling that produced by the fall
of &s;ome heavy piece of furniture. The &s;hock extended
through the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, and was
felt on both &s;ides of the river Thames, from Greenwich
to the We&s;tward of London; but not perceptible at any
con&s;iderable di&s;tance. On the very &s;ame day of the next
month, between five and &s;ix o'clock in the morning, the
inhabitants of the metropolis were again affrighted by a
&s;econd &s;hock, more violent than the fir&s;t, and abundantly
more alarming, as it waked the greater part of the people
from their repo&s;e. It was preceded by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
thick low fla&s;hes of lightning, and a rumbling noi&s;e, like
that of a heavy carriage rolling over a hollow pavement.
The &s;hock it&s;elf con&s;i&s;ted of repeated vibrations, which
la&s;ted &s;ome &s;econds, and violently &s;hook every hou&s;e from
top to bottom. Again the chairs rocked, the &s;helves
clattered, the &s;mall bells rang, and in &s;ome places public
clocks were heard to &s;trike. Many per&s;ons, rou&s;ed by this
terrible vi&s;itation, &s;tarted naked from their beds, and ra$$
to their doors and windows in di&s;traction: yet no life was
lo&s;t, and no hou&s;e overthrown by this concu&s;&s;ion, though
it was &s;o dreadful as to threaten an immediate di&s;&s;olution
of the globe. The circum&s;tance, however, did not fai$
to make a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon ignorant, weak, and
&s;uper&s;titious minds, which were the more affected by the
con&s;ideration that the two &s;hocks were periodical; tha$
the &s;econd, which happened exactly one month after th$
fir&s;t, had been the more violent; and that the next, in|crea&s;ing
in proportion, might be attended with the mo&s;$
di&s;mal con&s;equences. This general notion was confirmed
and indeed propagated, among all ranks of people by th$
<PB N="271" REF="279">
admonitions of a fanatick &s;oldier, who publickly preached
up repentance, and boldly prophe&s;ied that the next &s;hock
would happen on the &s;ame of April, and totally de&s;troy
the cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. Con&s;idering the
infectious nature of fear and &s;uper&s;tition, and the emphatic
manner in which the imagination had been prepared and
prepo&s;&s;ed, it is no wonder that the prediction of this
illiterate enthu&s;ia&s;t &s;hould have contributed in a great
mea&s;ure to augment the general terror. The churches
were crowded with penitent &s;inners: the &s;ons of riot and
profligacy were overawed into &s;obriety and decorum.
The &s;treets no longer re&s;ounded with execrations, or the
noi&s;e of brutal licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and the hand of charity
was liberally opened. Tho&s;e whom fortune had enabled
to retire from the devoted city fled to the country with
hurry and precipitation, in&s;omuch that the highways were
encumbered with hor&s;es and carriages. Many who had,
in the beginning, combated the&s;e groundle&s;s fears with
the weapons of rea&s;on and ridicule, began in&s;en&s;ibly to
imbibe the contagion, and felt their hearts fail, in pro|portion
as the hour of probation approached: even &s;cience
and philo&s;ophy were not proof again&s;t the unaccountable
effects of this communication. In after-ages it will
hardly be believed, that on the evening of the eighth day
of April the open fields that &s;kirt the metropolis were
filled with an incredible number of people, a&s;&s;embled in
chairs, in chai&s;es, and coaches, as well as on foot, who
waited in the mo&s;t fearful &s;u&s;pen&s;e until morning and
the return of day di&s;proved the truth of the dreaded pro|phe&s;y.
Then their fears vani&s;hed: they returned to
their re&s;pective habitations in a tran&s;port of joy; and
were &s;oon reconciled to their abandoned vices, which they
&s;eemed to re&s;ume with redoubled affection, and once
more bade defiance to the vengeance of heaven.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. By this time all the jails in England were filled
with the refu&s;e of the army and navy, which having been
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed at the peace, and either aver&s;e to labour, or
excluded from employment, had naturally preyed upon
<PB N="272" REF="280">
the commonwealth. Great numbers of tho&s;e wretches
who, by proper regulations, might have been rendered
&s;erviceable to the community, were executed as examples;
and the re&s;t peri&s;hed mi&s;erably, amid&s;t the &s;tench and
horrors of noi&s;ome dungeons. Even the pri&s;on of New|gate
was rendered &s;o infectious by the uncommon crowds
of confined felons, &s;tewed together in clo&s;e apartments,
that the very air they breathed acquired a pe&s;tilential degree
of putrefaction. It was this putrified air, which, adher|ing
to the clothes of the malefactors brought to trial at
the bar of the Old-Bailey in May, produced among the
audience a pe&s;tilential fever, which infected and proved
fatal to the lord-mayor of London, to one alderman, two
of the judges, divers lawyers who attended the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the
greate&s;t part of the jury, and a con&s;iderable number of the
&s;pectators. In order to prevent &s;uch di&s;a&s;ters for the
future, the jails were clean&s;ed, and accommodated with
ventilators, which exhau&s;t the foul and &s;upply a circu|lation
of fre&s;h air; and other humane precautions were
taken for the benefit of the pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. The affairs of the continent underwent no re|markable
alteration. An amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary being
&s;ent to Peter&s;burgh from the court of London, declared
to the Czarina's mini&s;ter, that in ca&s;e of a rupture between
Ru&s;&s;ia and Sweden, occa&s;ioned by the ho&s;tilities com|mitted
by the former power, his Britannick Maje&s;ty would
con&s;ider Ru&s;&s;ia as the aggre&s;&s;or, and the Czarina could
not expect that he would &s;upply her with the &s;uccour$
which he was engaged by treaty to furni&s;h for her defence
in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould be attacked. A declaration of the &s;ame
nature was made by the amba&s;&s;ador of her Imperial Ma|je&s;ty
the Queen of Hungary, while the mini&s;ters of France
and Pru&s;&s;ia, who were in &s;trict alliance with Sweden,
$$ve her to under&s;tand, that they would punctually fulfill
their engagements with the court of Stockholm, &s;hould
&s;he actually invade the Swedi&s;h territories of Finland. The
$pirit with which the King of Pru&s;&s;ia exerted him&s;elf on
this occa&s;ion gave infinite umbrage to the Czarina, who,
<PB N="273" REF="281">
indeed, expre&s;&s;ed her re&s;entment, by treating the mini|&s;ter
of Brandenburgh with contemptuous neglect, and
even refu&s;ed to favour him with an audience, till he &s;hould
be ve&s;ted with the character of amba&s;&s;ador. Thus were
&s;own the feeds of mi&s;under&s;tanding between tho&s;e two
powers, which, in the &s;equel, grew up to the mo&s;t bitter
animo&s;ity, and &s;erved to inflame tho&s;e di&s;&s;entions which
have de&s;olated the faire&s;t provinces of Germany. The
remon&s;trance of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty with re&s;pect to the
troubles of the North was couched in &s;uch terms as gave
di&s;&s;atisfaction to the court of Peter&s;burgh. The Ru&s;&s;ian
mini&s;ter retired from Berlin without the ceremony of
taking leave, and the Pru&s;&s;ian amba&s;&s;ador Warendorf was
recalled from the court of the Czarina.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. The attention of his Britannick Maje&s;ty was
not wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the di&s;putes between Ru&s;&s;ia and
Sweden. He had another object in view, which more
nearly concerned the intere&s;t of his German dominions;
and had &s;et on foot two negociations of the utmo&s;t impor|tance
to the commerce and advantage of Great-Britain.
His fir&s;t and principal aim was, in conjunction with the
court of Vienna, to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as would &s;ecure
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Imperial dignity to the Archduke
Jo&s;eph, elde&s;t &s;on and heir of the reigning Emperor. As
the previous &s;tep to that elevation, it was propo&s;ed to elect
this young prince King of the Romans; and for this
purpo&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to procure a majority not only of
the electors, but al&s;o in the diet of the empire, through
which the propo&s;al mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed. No &s;tone was left
unturned to reconcile this expedient to the German prin|ces.
Sub&s;idies were offered by the maritime powers of
England and the States-General to the Electors of Mentz
and Cologn; and a treaty of the &s;ame nature was con|cluded
with the Elector of Bavaria, who, in con&s;ideration
of an annual &s;ub&s;idy, amounting to forty thou&s;and pounds
&s;terling, two thirds to be paid by Britain, and the re&s;t by
the States-General, engaged to keep in readine&s;s a body
of &s;ix thou&s;and infantry, as auxiliaries to the Maritime
<PB N="274" REF="282">
Powers, though not to act again&s;t the Emperor or empire;
and to join the intere&s;t of his Britannick Maje&s;ty in the
diet, as well as in the electoral college. In order to render
the King of Poland, Elector of Saxony, propitious to
this de&s;ign, he was accommodated with the loan of
a very con&s;iderable &s;um, upon the mortgage of certain
bailiwicks and lord&s;hips belonging to the Saxon dominions.
Thus, a majority of the electors was &s;ecured, and &s;uch
foundations were laid for the &s;ucce&s;s of this project, that
it was generally believed it would be accompli&s;hed in his
Britannick Maje&s;ty's next vi&s;it to his German dominions.
Hopes, it was &s;aid, were given to the King of Sweden,
that his concurrence would be gratified by erecting the
hou&s;e of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, of which he was head, into a tenth
electorate. Arguments of an intere&s;ting nature were u&s;ed
with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the Elector Palatine, that,
if po&s;&s;ible, the diet might unanimou&s;ly approve of this
mea&s;ure, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for e&s;tabli&s;hing the peace of the
empire, and preventing &s;uch troubles as aro&s;e from a di&s;|puted
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion at the death of Charles the Sixth. The&s;e
endeavours, however, did not &s;ucceed in their full ex|tent.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. The King of Pru&s;&s;ia, as Elector of Branden|burgh,
oppo&s;ed the election as unnece&s;&s;ary and improper,
on account of the health and vigour of the reigning em|peror,
and the tender years of the Archduke. This
monarch had &s;et him&s;elf up as a balance to the power of
the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, which had long a&s;pired to ab&s;olute
dominion over its co-e&s;tates, and endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h
an hereditary right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the empire: he, there|fore,
employed all his influence to fru&s;trate the mea&s;ure
propo&s;ed, either actuated by a &s;pirit of pure patrioti&s;m, or
in&s;pired with de&s;igns which he had not yet thought proper
to declare. The oppo&s;ition was joined by the Elector
Palatine, and countenanced by the French King; who
prote&s;ted, that, for the &s;ake of peace, he would not oppo&s;e
this election, though contrary to the Golden Bull, pro|vided
it &s;hould be confirmed by the unanimous con&s;ent of
<PB N="275" REF="283">
the electoral college: but, &s;hould any one member &s;ignify
his di&s;&s;ent, and he or any &s;tate of the empire claim the
protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty,
he could not di&s;pen&s;e with granting both, in con&s;equence
of his being guarantee of the treaty of We&s;tphalia; an
engagement by which he was obliged to &s;uccour tho&s;e
princes and &s;tates of the empire who might have recour&s;e
to him, in ca&s;e of any grievance they &s;uffered, contrary to
what was &s;tipulated in that con&s;titution. This declaration
co-operating with the known character of his Pru&s;&s;ian
Maje&s;ty, who&s;e great army overawed Hanover and Bo|hemia,
in all probability damped that vigour with which
the courts of Vienna and Herenhau&s;en had hitherto pro|&s;ecuted
this important negociation.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. The &s;econd object that employed the atten|tion
of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try was the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the
preci&s;e limits of Acadia, or Nova-Scotia, where the new
colony had &s;uffered great mi&s;chief and interruption from
the incur&s;ions of the Indians, excited to the&s;e outrages by
the &s;ubjects and emi&s;&s;aries of France. Commi&s;&s;aries had
been appointed, by both crowns, to meet at Paris, and
compromi&s;e the&s;e di&s;putes: but the conferences were ren|dered
abortive by every art of cavilling, chicanery, and
procra&s;tination, which the French commi&s;&s;ioners oppo&s;ed
to the ju&s;tice and per&s;picuity of the Engli&s;h claims. They
not only mi&s;interpreted treaties, though expre&s;&s;ed with
the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion, and perplexed the conferences with
difficulties and matter foreign to the &s;ubject, but they
carried the fine&s;&s;e of perfidy &s;o far as to produce fal&s;e
charts and maps of the country, in which the rivers and
boundaries were mi&s;placed and mi&s;repre&s;ented. At this
time al&s;o the in&s;incerity of the French court appeared in
affected delays and artful objections, with re&s;pect to the
evacuation of the neutral i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies; and
the governours of the Briti&s;h plantations, in different
parts of North-America, tran&s;mitted intelligence, that
the French had begun to make encroachments on the back
of the Engli&s;h colonies.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="284">
&sect; XLV. Perhaps the precarious footing on which the
peace &s;tood between Great-Britain and France at this
juncture, and the critical &s;ituation of affairs in Ger|many,
determined the mini&s;try of England to compromi&s;e
all differences with Spain, upon &s;uch terms as at any
other time they would hardly have embraced. In order
to di&s;cu&s;s tho&s;e points between the two nations, which
had not been &s;ettled by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle,
conferences were al&s;o begun at Madrid, and carried on
by Mr. Keene, plenipotentiary of his Britannick Maje&s;ty,
and Don Jo&s;eph de Carvajal and Lanca&s;tro, the Spani&s;h
King's mini&s;ter. At length a treaty was concluded on
the&s;e conditions: The King of Spain engaged to pay, in
three months, to the South-Sea company of England
one hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, as an indemnification
for all claims upon his crown, by virtue of the
A&s;&s;iento. In other re&s;pects, the trade and navigation of
the Engli&s;h to the ports of Spain were regulated by for|mer
treaties. It was &s;tipulated, That they &s;hould pay no
other duties than tho&s;e that were exacted of them in the
reign of Charles II. of Spain: That they &s;hould be treated
on the footing of the mo&s;t favoured nations; and con|tinue
to enjoy the privilege of taking &s;alt at the i&s;land of
Tortuga. But there was no article re&s;tricting the Spa|ni&s;h
guarda co&s;tas from &s;earching the Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els on
the high &s;eas; although, as we have already ob&s;erved,
this in&s;olent prerogative, a&s;&s;umed without right, and ex|erci&s;ed
without humanity, was, in effect, the original
and &s;ole cau&s;e of the late rupture, which had been at|tended
with &s;uch enormous expen&s;e to the nation. It
mu&s;t be owned, however, that his Catholick Maje&s;ty
was at this period extremely well di&s;po&s;ed to live upon
good terms with Great-Britain. He was re&s;olved to in|dulge
his people with the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, to propagate
a &s;pirit of indu&s;try throughout his dominions, and in par|ticular
to encourage commerce, which he fore&s;aw would
prove a much more certain and inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of
wealth, power, and influence, than all the trea&s;ures he could
<PB N="277" REF="285">
drain from the mines of Mexico and Peru. His re&s;olu|tions
on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject were chiefly directed by
Don Ricardo Wall, who now acted as his mini&s;ter at
London; a gentleman of Iri&s;h extract, who had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
him&s;elf in the field as well as in the cabinet, and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the joint qualifications of a general and a &s;tate&s;|man.
He had, by virtue of a pa&s;&s;port, come over pri|vately
to England before the peace, in order to pave the
way for the treaty, by a &s;ecret negociation with the Eng|li&s;h
mini&s;ters; but, immediately after the peace was pro|claimed,
he appeared in the character of amba&s;&s;ador.
He was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t in&s;inuating addre&s;s, &s;hrewd,
penetrating, and inqui&s;itive. While he re&s;ided in Lon|don,
he &s;pared no pains in learning the nature of
tho&s;e manufactures, and that commerce, by which Great-Britain
had been &s;o remarkably aggrandized; and on his
return to Spain, where in a little time he was placed at
the helm of affairs, he turned the knowledge he had thus
acquired to the advantage of his country. He not only
promoted the u&s;eful arts within the kingdom of Spain,
but demon&s;trated the infinite advantages that would accrue
from an active trade, which the Spaniards had for many
ages neglected; and in a few years their &s;hips were &s;een
to &s;warm in all the commercial ports of Europe. Of
other foreign events which di&s;tingui&s;hed this &s;ummer,
the mo&s;t remarkable was the death of John King of
Portugal, who perfectly under&s;tood, and &s;teadily pur&s;ued,
the true intere&s;ts of his country, and in whom many
princely qualities were deba&s;ed by a cruel &s;pirit of bigot|ry
and &s;uper&s;tition. He was &s;ucceeded by his elde&s;t
&s;on Jo&s;eph, who, if he has fallen &s;hort of his father in
&s;ome re&s;pects, cannot be ju&s;tly charged with having in|herited
this paternal weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVI. The King of Great-Britain having returned
to England, opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament in January
with a &s;peech, importing, That he had concluded a
treaty with the King of Spain, and amicably adju&s;ted
&s;uch differences as could not be &s;o properly compromi&s;ed
<PB N="278" REF="286">
in a general treaty: That the commerce of this nation
with that country was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the mo&s;t ad|vantageous
and &s;ure foundations; and that there was the
greate&s;t rea&s;on to hope the ancient friend&s;hip between
Great-Britain and Spain would, from mutual inclination
as well as intere&s;t, be now effectually re&s;tored. He told
them, That, in conjunction with the Empre&s;es-Queen
and the States-General, he had concluded a treaty with
the Elector of Bavaria; and was employed in taking &s;uch
further mea&s;ures as might be&s;t tend to &s;trengthen and
&s;ecure the tranquillity of the Empire, &s;upport its &s;y&s;tem,
and timely anticipate &s;uch events as had been found by
experience to endanger the common cau&s;e, involve Eu|rope
in the calamities of war, and occa&s;ion the lo&s;s of
much blood and trea&s;ure to the&s;e kingdoms. He promi&s;ed,
that both the&s;e treaties &s;hould be &s;ubjected to their peru&s;al:
he gave them to under&s;tand, That he had received from
all the other contracting powers in the definitive treaty
of Aix-la-Chapelle the mo&s;t full and clear declarations
of their re&s;olution to pre&s;erve the general peace; and
that he had taken care to con&s;olidate the ties of union
and friend&s;hip between him and his allies, the better to
&s;ecure their mutual intere&s;ts, maintain the peace already
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and prevent the occa&s;ion of any future rupture.
Finally, he recommended unanimity, the improvement
of commerce, and the effectual &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch out|rages
and violences as are incon&s;i&s;tent with good order
and government, and endanger the lives and properties of
the &s;ubject, who&s;e happine&s;s and flouri&s;hing condition he
had entirely at heart.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVII. When the motion was made for an addre&s;s
of thanks, couched in terms that favoured of the mo&s;t
implicit complai&s;ance, approbation, and acquie&s;cence in
the mea&s;ures which the crown had taken, the Earl of
Eg&mdash;t, and &s;ome other anti-courtiers, affirmed, that &s;uch
an addre&s;s would be equally &s;ervile and ab&s;urd. They
ob&s;erved, That nothing could be more prepo&s;terous than
a blind approbation of mea&s;ures which they did not know:
<PB N="279" REF="287">
That nothing could be more ridiculous than their con|gratulations
on the pre&s;ent happy tranquillity, when al|mo&s;t
every day's news-papers informed them of &s;ome
Briti&s;h &s;hip's being &s;ei&s;ed by the Spaniards, or &s;ome new
attack made by the French on our infant colony in Nova-Scotia.
With re&s;pect to the continent of Europe, they
affirmed, That the tranquillity of Germany would have
been upon a much more &s;olid foundation, had England
never interpo&s;ed in the affairs of the Empire: in that
ca&s;e the princes would of them&s;elves have &s;upported the
con&s;titution of their own country: That the election of
an infant for king of the Romans was much more likely
to di&s;turb than e&s;tabli&s;h the tranquillity of Europe; be|cau&s;e
it would help to overturn the con&s;titution of the
Empire, by rendering the imperial dignity hereditary in
one hou&s;e, in&s;tead of being the re&s;ult of a free election.
They took notice, that the con&s;titution had provided
vicars to govern the Empire during the vacancy of the
Imperial throne; but had made no provi&s;ion of regents,
protectors, or guardians for a minor emperor, becau&s;e it
was never &s;uppo&s;ed that a minor would be cho&s;en. They
inveighed again&s;t the late treaty with Spain; in which,
they &s;aid, the mini&s;try, for the paultry &s;um of one hundred
thou&s;and pounds, had given up the claims of the South-Sea
company, and other Briti&s;h merchants, who had
&s;uffered from depredations to the amount of one million
three hundred thou&s;and pounds; and bartered away the
freedom of our trade and navigation, by leaving untouched
that prerogative which the Spaniards have a&s;&s;umed of
&s;earching the Briti&s;h &s;hips in the open &s;eas, and confi&s;|cating
them, &s;hould they find on board the lea&s;t particle
of what they called contraband merchandi&s;e. They pro|duced
an in&s;tance of an Engli&s;h &s;hip, lately driven by
&s;tre&s;s of weather into one of the ports of the Spani&s;h
We&s;t-Indies, where &s;he was &s;earched, &s;ei&s;ed, and con|demned,
under this pretence. They re-capitulated the
conduct of the French, who, in the mid&s;t of their de|clarations
of peace and moderation, were &s;till employed
<PB N="280" REF="288">
in fortifying their &s;ettlements on the neutral i&s;lands, as
well as in harra&s;&s;ing and encroaching upon our plantations
in North-America. They exclaimed again&s;t the treaty
of &s;ub&s;idy with the Elector of Bavaria, or any other prince
in time of peace; ob&s;erving, that for &s;ome years the
nation had paid &s;uch pen&s;ions to the Danes and the
He&s;&s;ians; but, in the cour&s;e of the late war the former
abandoned our intere&s;ts, and the latter actually took arms
again&s;t Great-Britain. They affirmed, that the &s;ub&s;idy
was greater than the nation could &s;pare; for, unle&s;s the
land-tax &s;hould be continued at four &s;hillings in the pound,
they could not afford a &s;hilling to any prince in Germany,
without encroaching upon the &s;inking fund. &startq;At &s;uch
a juncture (&s;aid a certain member) will any gentleman
pre&s;ume to propo&s;e the continuation of &s;uch an im|po&s;ition
on the land-holder, for the &s;ake of bribing
the princes of Germany to do what?&mdash;to pre&s;erve
the freedom and independency of their native country.
I &s;ay, princes of Germany, becau&s;e this &s;ub&s;i|dy
to Bavaria will &s;ignify nothing, unle&s;s we take
half a &s;core more of them into our pay; and when we
have thus indulged them for &s;even years of peace, they
may give us the &s;lip, as others have done, whenever
another war &s;hall be declared.&endq; Again&s;t the&s;e objections
the motion was &s;upported by Mr. William Pitt, at this time
an advocate for the mini&s;try. He ob&s;erved, That the addre&s;s
was no more than the u&s;ual compliment to the throne, which
did not imply an obligation on the parliament to approve
of mea&s;ures which they might find cau&s;e to cen&s;ure upon
further enquiry. He &s;aid, the trivial di&s;putes &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing
between this nation and the Spaniards, or French,
would &s;oon be terminated amicably, and could never
affect the general tranquillity of Europe, which was to
be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a firm alliance between his Maje&s;ty
and &s;uch a confederacy upon the continent as would be
an over-match for the hou&s;e of Bourbon. He expatiated
upon his Maje&s;ty's wi&s;dom in taking off from the French
intere&s;t &s;uch a powerful prince as the Elector of Bavaria,
<PB N="281" REF="289">
and concerting other &s;alutary mea&s;ures for pre&s;erving the
balance of power on the continent. he defended the arti|cles
of the late treaty with Spain; ob&s;erving, that what
remained of the A&s;&s;iento contract was a matter of very
little con&s;equence to the South-Sea company; that the
demands of this company, and other Briti&s;h merchants,
were all cancelled by the rupture with Spain, and more
than recompen&s;ed to the nation by a great balance of cap|tures
during the war, as well as by the great traffick carried
on with the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements in the We&s;t-Indies,
after it had been laid open by the demolition of thier
fortre&s;&s;es. He a&s;&s;erted, that by this treaty the court of
Spain had made many important conce&s;&s;ions: they had
conde&s;cended to pay a great &s;um to the South-Sea company&punc;
they had con&s;ented to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Briti&s;h
trade in Spain, upon a very advantageous and &s;olid footing,
by agreeing that the &s;ubjects of Great Britain &s;hould
pay no other duties on merchandi&s;e than tho&s;e exacted
of his Catholick Maje&s;ty's own &s;ubjects, and to aboli&s;h
all innovations that had been introduced into the commerce.
He affirmed, that the article of No Search was a &s;tipulation
which it would have been ridiculous to in&s;i&s;t upon; and
thought proper to obviate a reproach which he fore&s;aw
the oppo&s;ition would throw upon him, from the circum|&s;tance
of his having, upon a former occa&s;ion, heartily
concurred in a motion for an addre&s;s, That no treaty of
peace with Spain &s;hould be admitted, unle&s;s &s;uch a &s;tipu|lation
&s;hould be fir&s;t obtained as a preliminary. He owned
he had &s;trenuou&s;ly contended for &s;uch a motion, becau&s;e
at that time, being very young and &s;anguine, he thought
it right and rea&s;onable: but he was now ten years older,
had con&s;idered matters more coolly, and was convinced
that the privilege of No Search, with re&s;pect to Briti&s;h
ve&s;&s;els &s;ailing near the American &s;hore, would never be
obtained, unle&s;s Spain &s;hould be brought &s;o low as to
acquie&s;ce in any terms we as victors might propo&s;e. He
likewi&s;e &s;ignified his conviction, that all addre&s;&s;es from
the Hou&s;e of Commons, during the cour&s;e of a war, for
<PB N="282" REF="290">
pre&s;cribing terms of peace, were in them&s;elves ridiculous;
and that every &s;uch addre&s;s was an encroachment on the
King's prerogative, which had always been attended with
unlucky con&s;equences. How far the&s;e arguments are
&s;atisfactory, conclu&s;ive, and con&s;i&s;tent, we &s;hall leave
to the reader's determination. Certain it is, they were
adopted by the majority, and the addre&s;s was pre&s;ented
without further oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVIII. The two grand committees appointed to
di&s;cu&s;s the &s;upplies for the en&s;uing year, and the funds
upon which they were to be rai&s;ed, proceeded, as u&s;ual,
under the direction of the mini&s;try; yet not without
&s;ome vehement oppo&s;ition, in which certain &s;ervants of
the crown expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t hearty concurrence. When
a motion was made for reducing the number of &s;eamen to
eight thou&s;and, Mr. W. Pitt, Mr. Lyttelton, and Mr.
G. Grenville, oppo&s;ed it with all their might of argument
and elocution; but they were over-ruled. Annual de|bates
were al&s;o revived, with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, upon
the number of troops con&s;tituting the &s;tanding army;
but the other re&s;olutions of the grand committees met
with little or no oppo&s;ition. The number of &s;eamen for
the en&s;uing year was limited to eight thou&s;and; and that
of the &s;tanding forces continued at eighteen thou&s;and
eight hundred and fifty-&s;even effective men, including
one thou&s;and eight hundred and fifteen invalids. The
Commons granted a con&s;iderable &s;um of money for pay|ing
off the principal of &s;uch redeemable &s;tocks as had not
been &s;ub&s;cribed, in pur&s;uance of two acts pa&s;&s;ed in the
la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion for reducing the intere&s;t of annuities. Thirty
thou&s;and pounds were given for fulfilling the King's en|gagement
with the Elector of Bavaria: large grants were
made for &s;upplying deficiencies, and replacing &s;ums bor|rowed
from the &s;inking-fund. The expen&s;e incurred by
the new colony in Nova-Scotia, not provided for by
parliament, exceeded fifty-&s;even thou&s;and pounds; and
the maintenance of it for the en&s;uing year was fixed at
fifty-three thou&s;and nine-hundred and twenty-&s;even
<PB N="283" REF="291">
pounds, fourteen &s;hillings, and four-pence. An enor|mous
charge! if we con&s;ider to how little purpo&s;e all
his bounty was be&s;towed. A fund was e&s;tabli&s;hed un|der
the &s;anction of parliament, for the relief and main|tenance
of the widows of &s;ea-officers, by allowing, upon
the books of every &s;hip of war in &s;ea-pay, the wages and
$$ctuals of one man for every hundred of which the com|$lement
&s;hall con&s;i&s;t, for &s;uch time only as the number
of men employed in the &s;ervice of the royal navy &s;hall
not exceed twenty thou&s;and. This was an additional in|dulgence,
over and above the allowance of one man
granted by a former act of parliament. On the whole,
$he provi&s;ions of this year amounted to five millions
one hundred twenty-five thou&s;and twenty-three pounds,
eleven &s;hillings and &s;even-pence, to be rai&s;ed by the u&s;ual
$uties: the &s;um of one million twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and four
$undred &s;eventy-&s;ix pounds, four &s;hillings, and &s;ix pence,
$dvanced by the Bank of England, to pay off their own un|$ubcribed
annuities, for which they accepted Exchequer-$ills
at three per cent. intere&s;t; by the land-tax at three
$hillings in the pound; a lottery and annuities, at the rate
$f three per cent. per ann. to be charged on the &s;ink|$ng
fund, redeemable by parliament. The annual mea&s;ure
$alled the mutiny-bill was not pa&s;&s;ed without di&s;pute and
$ltercation: &s;ome alterations were propo&s;ed, but not
$dopted; and the &s;entences of court-martials &s;till &s;ubjected
$o one revi&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIX. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e deliberations the
$ingdom was alarmed with an event which overwhelmed
$he people with grief and con&s;ternation. His royal high|$e&s;s
the Prince of Wales, in con&s;equence of a cold caught
$n his garden at Kew, was &s;ei&s;ed with a pleuretick di&s;or|der;
and, after a &s;hort illne&s;s, expired on the twentieth
day of March, to the un&s;peakable affliction of his royal
con&s;ort, and the unfeigned &s;orrow of all who wi&s;hed
well to their country. This excellent prince, who now
died in the forty-fifth year of his age, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
every amiable quality which could engage the affection
of the people: a tender and obliging hu&s;band, a fond pa|rent,
<PB N="284" REF="292">
a kind ma&s;ter, liberal, generous, candid, and hu|mane;
a munificent patron of the arts, an unwearied
friend to merit; well di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;ert the rights of man|kind
in general, and warmly attached to the intere&s;t of
Great-Britain. The nation could not but be afflicted at
&s;eeing a prince of &s;uch expectations ravi&s;hed from their
hopes; and their grief was the better founded, as the
King had already attained to an advanced age, and the
heir apparent, George, now Prince of Wales, was a
minor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1751.</NOTE></P>
<P>&sect; L. His Maje&s;ty, fore&s;eeing all the inconveniencies
which might ari&s;e from a minority, deliberated with his
council on this &s;ubject, and re&s;olved to obtain a parlia|mentary
&s;anction for the mea&s;ures judged nece&s;&s;ary to
&s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. With this view he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to
both Hou&s;es on the $wenty-&s;ixth day of April, importing.
That nothing could conduce &s;o much to the pre&s;ervation
of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in his royal family, as proper
provi&s;ions for the tuition of the per&s;on of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and
for the regular admini&s;tration of the government, in ca&s;e
the &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould be of tender years: his Maje&s;ty, there|fore,
earne&s;tly recommended this weighty affair to the
deliberation of parliament; and propo&s;ed, that when the
imperial crown of the&s;e realms &s;hould de&s;cend to any of
the late prince's &s;ons, being under the age of eighteen
years, his mother, the Prince&s;s Dowager of Wales, &s;hould
be guardian of his per&s;on, and regent of the&s;e kingdoms,
until he &s;hould attain the age of majority, with &s;uch pow|ers
and limitations as &s;hould appear nece&s;&s;ary and expedi|ent
for the&s;e purpo&s;es. This me&s;&s;age produced a very affec|tionate
addre&s;s, promi&s;ing to take the affair into their &s;erious
con&s;ideration: and in the beginning of May the Duke of
Newca&s;tle pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of Peers a bill to pro|vide
for the admini&s;tration of government, in ca&s;e the
crown &s;hould de&s;cend to a minor. The bill was read a
&s;econd time, and committed, when a &s;econd me&s;&s;age ar|rived
from his Maje&s;ty, recommending to their con&s;ider|ation
the &s;ettlement of &s;uch a council of regency as the
bill propo&s;ed, con&s;i&s;ting of his royal highne&s;s the Duke
<PB N="285" REF="293">
of Cumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1751.</NOTE> who at that time commanded the army,
the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor, the
Lord-High Trea&s;urer, or fir&s;t lord commi&s;&s;ioner of the
Trea&s;ury, the Pre&s;ident of the Council, the Lord Privy-Seal,
the Lord High Admiral of Great-Britain, or fir&s;t
commi&s;&s;ioner of the Admiralty, the two principal Secre|taries
of State, and the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the King's-Bench,
all the&s;e great officers, except his royal highne&s;s
the Duke, for the time being. This bill did not pa&s;s
through the Lower Hou&s;e without violent debate and bitter
&s;arca&s;ms. The council of regency, though e&s;pou&s;ed by
all the mini&s;try, including the payma&s;ter-general, met
with fierce oppo&s;ition, as an unnece&s;&s;ary and fatal re|&s;triction,
that would impede the machine of government,
and, as the council was con&s;tituted, might be productive
of the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equences. Some of the mem|bers
ventured even to in&s;inuate the danger of leaving at the
head of a large &s;tanding army a prince of the blood, ve&s;ted
with a &s;hare of the regency, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great per&s;onal
influence, the darling of the &s;oldiery, brave, popular, and
enterpri&s;ing; &s;uppo&s;ed not wholly devoid of ambition,
and not at all remarkable for any &s;ymptoms of extraordinary
affection towards the per&s;on of the heir apparent. The
hi&s;tory of England was ran&s;acked for invidious in&s;tances
of royal uncles and regents, who had injured the &s;ove|reigns,
and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the government, by their pride,
cruelty, and ambition. The characters of John Lackland,
and John of Ghent, Humphrey and Richard Dukes of
Glouce&s;ter, were called in review, canva&s;&s;ed, compared,
and quoted, with &s;ome odious applications: but the ma|jority,
being convinced of the loyalty, virtue, integrity,
and great abilities of his royal highne&s;s, to whom the
nation owed obligations of the mo&s;t important nature, pa&s;|&s;ed
the bill with a few amendments, in which the Lords
acquie&s;ced; and in a little time it received the royal &s;anction.</P>
<P>&sect; LI. The death of the Prince of Wales was fatal to a
bill which had been brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons,
for naturalizing all foreign prote&s;tants who &s;hould &s;ettle
within the dominions of Great-Britain. Political arithme|ticians
<PB N="286" REF="294">
have generally taken it for granted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1751.</NOTE> that to every
commercial nation an increa&s;e of people is an increa&s;e of
opulence; and this maxim is certainly true, on the &s;uppo|&s;ition
that every individual is indu&s;trious, and that there is
a &s;ufficient field for employment; but all the&s;e genera
maxims ought to be received under certain qualifications
When all branches of manufacture are over&s;tocked, a$
addition of workmen will doubtle&s;s be an additional incum|brance
on the community. In the debates which this
bill produced, the members of the mini&s;try were divided
among them&s;elves. The mea&s;ure was enforced by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. W. Pitt, and Mr. Lyt|telton;
and in oppo&s;ing it the Earl of Egmont was joined
by Mr. Fox, &s;ecretary at war. Petitions and counter-petitions
were pre&s;ented by the merchants of London,
Bri&s;tol, and other trading towns of the kingdom. All
merchants and traders of foreign extraction exerted them|&s;elves
vigorou&s;ly in its behalf, and it was without doubt
countenanced by the admini&s;tration; but the project was
odious to the people in general. The Lord-Mayor, alder|men,
and commons of London, in common council
a&s;&s;embled, compo&s;ed a remon&s;trance to the Lower Hou&s;e,
&s;etting forth the danger and inutility of a general naturali|zation
of foreign prote&s;tants. A petition of the merchants
and principal inhabitants of Bri&s;tol repre&s;ented that &s;uch a
law would be prejudicial to the trade and commerce of
this kingdom, by preventing many indu&s;trious artificers
from procuring a &s;ufficient &s;upport for them&s;elves and their
families, and of con&s;equence increa&s;ing the rates of the
poor: that the introduction of &s;uch a number of foreigners
in&s;tead of being a &s;upport to the pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;h|ment,
might endanger the very ba&s;is of our con&s;titution:
that it would greatly tend to the diminution of our manu|factures,
as many &s;trangers would doubtle&s;s come and re&s;ide
in England for a time, in order to learn the methods and ma|nagement
of our manufacturers and artificers; and, after
having obtained this in&s;truction, return to their native
countries, where they would e&s;tabli&s;h and carry on works
of the &s;ame nature. The twentieth day of March being
<PB N="287" REF="295">
appointed for the third reading of the bill, it was po&s;tpon|$d,
in con&s;equence of the unfortunate death of the Prince
of Wales; and other petitions from different cities of the
$ingdom being mu&s;tered again&s;t it in the &s;equel, the mi|ni&s;try
did not think proper to per&s;i&s;t in an unpopular mea|$ure
at &s;uch a delicate conjuncture; &s;o the bill was no more
brought upon the carpet. Divers other regulations, relat|$ng
to civil policy as well as to the commerce of Great-Britain,
were propounded in the Hou&s;e of Commons;
but the&s;e propo&s;als proved abortive, either becau&s;e they ap|peared
crude and indige&s;ted in them&s;elves, or the Hou&s;e
could not obtain proper information touching the allegati|ons
they contained.</P>
<P>&sect; LII. There were no other tran&s;actions in this &s;e&s;&s;ion
except the concurrence of both Hou&s;es in &s;tigmati&s;ing a
printed paper, intituled &startq;Con&s;titutional Queries, earne&s;t|ly
recommended to the &s;erious con&s;ideration of every
true Briton;&endq; and the &s;teps taken by the Commons, in
con&s;equence of the commotions occa&s;ioned by the We&s;t|min&s;ter
election. The abovementioned paper, which had
been conveyed by letter to the majority of both Hou&s;es,
was communicated to the Lords in the month of January
by the Duke of Marlborough, who moved for re&s;olutions
again&s;t it as a &s;editious libel, and that the concurrence of
the Commons might be de&s;ired. A conference accordingly
en&s;ued, and both hou&s;es concurred in voting the paper a
fal&s;e, malicious, &s;candalous, infamous, and &s;editious libel,
containing the mo&s;t fal&s;e, audacious, and abominable
calumnies and indignities upon his maje&s;ty, and the mo&s;t
pre&s;umptuous and wicked in&s;inuations that our laws, liber|ties,
and properties, and the excellent con&s;titution of this
kingdom, were in danger under his Maje&s;ty's legal, mild,
and gracious government, with intent to in&s;till groundle&s;s
&s;u&s;picions and jealou&s;ies into the minds of his Maje&s;ty's
good &s;ubjects, and to alienate their affections from his
Maje&s;ty and his royal family. It was, therefore, re&s;olved
by the Lords &s;piritual and temporal and Commons in par|liament
a&s;&s;embled, That, in abhorrence and dete&s;tation of
&s;uch abominable and &s;editious practices, the paper &s;hould
<PB N="288" REF="296">
be burnt by the hands of the common hangman in the new
Palace-yard of We&s;tmin&s;ter; and this &s;entence was execut|ed
accordingly. Then they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to his Ma|je&s;ty,
de&s;iring that the mo&s;t effectual means might be taken
for di&s;covering the author, printer, or publi&s;her, that he
or they might be brought to condign puni&s;hment. Direc|tions
were given for this purpo&s;e; but without effect.
Tho&s;e concerned in writing, printing, and circulating
the paper had acted with &s;uch caution, that not one of
them was ever di&s;covered.</P>
<P>&sect; LIII. The proceedings of the Commons with re&s;pect
to the election of a burge&s;s for We&s;tmin&s;ter were attended
with &s;ome extraordinary circum&s;tances, which we &s;hall
now record, for the edification of tho&s;e who pique them|&s;elves
on the privileges of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject. We have
already ob&s;erved, that a majority appearing on the poll for
Lord Trentham, the adherents of the other canditate, Sir
George Vandeput, demanded a &s;crutiny, which was granted
by the high-bailiff of We&s;tmin&s;ter, the returning officer.
During this tedious inve&s;tigation, which rolled chiefly on the
qualification of voters, he acted with &s;uch addre&s;s and
&s;eeming candour as gave entire &s;atisfaction to both parties,
till at length he determined in favour of Lord Trentham,
whom he returned as duly elected. Tho&s;e who &s;tiled them|&s;elves
the independent electors did not acquie&s;ce in this
determination without clamour, reproach, menaces, and
riot. They taxed Mr. Leigh, the high-bailiff, with par|tiality
and inju&s;tice: they loudly affirmed, that mini&s;terial
influence had been u&s;ed in the mo&s;t &s;candalous manner;
and, finally, joined Sir George Vandeput in a petition to
the Lower Hou&s;e, complaining of an undue election and
return of a member for the city of We&s;tmin&s;ter. The
Commons, in&s;tead of enquiring into the merits of the&s;e pe|titions,
ordered them to lie upon the table; and, without
any complaint from any per&s;on whatever, a motion was
made, that Leigh, the high-bailiff, &s;hould attend the Hou&s;e
immediately, in order to make them acquainted with what
he had done in pur&s;uance of the directions he had formerly
<PB N="289" REF="297">
received from that Hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1754.</NOTE> touching the execution of the
writ for electing a new member to repre&s;ent the city of
We&s;tmin&s;ter. As this motion had been preconcerted, Leigh
was attending in the lobby, and immediately called into
the Hou&s;e to be examined on this &s;ubject. Having, in the
cour&s;e of his examination, alledged that the election had
been protracted by affected delays, he was a&s;ked by whom,
and by what means; but, before he could an&s;wer, the
Earl of Egmont, interpo&s;ing, objected to the que&s;tion as
improper, and moved for the order of the day. A debate
immediately en&s;ued, in which the impropriety of the que|&s;tion
was demon&s;trated by Mr. Henley, now lord-keeper,
Dr. Lee, and &s;ome others, the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and moderate
members of the Hou&s;e: but they were oppo&s;ed with great
violence by Lord Vi&s;count Corke, Henry Fox, E&s;q. Sir
William Yonge, Colonel Lyttelton, and the weight of
the mini&s;try; &s;o that the motion for the order of the day
was carried in the negative, and the high bailiff required to
an&s;wer the que&s;tion. Thus interrogated, he declared
that he had been impeded in the &s;crutiny, and mal-treated,
by Mr. Crowle, who had acted as coun&s;el for Sir George
Vandeput, by the honourable Alexander Murray, brother
to Lord Elibank, and one Gib&s;on, an uphol&s;terer, who had
been very active, zealous, and turbulent in his endeavours
to promote the intere&s;t of Sir George Vandeput, or rather
to thwart the preten&s;ions of the other candidate, who was
&s;uppo&s;ed to be countenanced by the mini&s;try. The&s;e
three per&s;ons, thus accu&s;ed, were brought to the bar of
the Hou&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trenuous remon&s;trances of
&s;everal members, who oppo&s;ed this method of proceeding,
as a &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;ion equally arbitrary and ab&s;urd.
They ob&s;erved, that, as no complaint had been preferred,
they had no right to take cognizance of the affair: that
if any undue influence had been u&s;ed, it would na|turally
appear when the merits of the election &s;hould
fall under their enquiry: that a complaint having been
lodged already again&s;t the returning officer, it was their
duty to inve&s;tigate his conduct, and puni&s;h him, if he
<PB N="290" REF="298">
&s;hould be found delinquent; but that nothing could be
more flagrantly unju&s;t, and apparently partial, than their
neglecting the petitions of the other candidate and electors,
and encouraging the high-bailiff, who &s;tood charged with
iniquity, to recriminate upon his accu&s;ers, that they might
be di&s;abled from giving evidence on the enquiry into the
merits of the election. What difference is it to the &s;ub|ject,
whether he is oppre&s;&s;ed by an arbitrary prince, or by
the de&s;potick in&s;olence of a mini&s;terial majority? Mr.
Crowle alledged, in his own vindication, that he had been
employed as a coun&s;el by the electors of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and
attended the &s;crutiny in that character; that after the high-bailiff
had, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, received the
order of the Hou&s;e to expedite the election, he hurried on
the &s;crutiny with &s;uch precipitation as, he apprehended,
was unju&s;t, and prejudicial to his clients; that, in this
apprehen&s;ion, he, (Mr. Crowle) in&s;i&s;ted upon the high-bailiff's
proceeding with more deliberation, and in &s;o doing
he thought he did his duty to his employers. Some evi|dence
being examined again&s;t him, declared he had not
only protracted the &s;crutiny, but al&s;o &s;poken di&s;re&s;pectful
words of the Hou&s;e of Commons: he was, therefore, repri|manded
on his knees by the Speaker, and di&s;charged.</P>
<P>&sect; LIV. Mr. Murray being charged with having utter|ed
&s;ome threatening and affrontive expre&s;&s;ions, the Hou&s;e
adjourned the con&s;ideration of this affair for &s;ome days, at
the expiration of which Mr. Murray was to be heard by
his coun&s;el: but, in the mean time, they ordered him to be
taken into cu&s;tody by the &s;erjeant at arms attending the
Hou&s;e. This &s;tep, however, was not taken without a
warm oppo&s;ition by &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;edate and intelligent
members of the Hou&s;e, who con&s;idered it as a cruel act of
oppre&s;&s;ion. They ob&s;erved, that in ca&s;es of breach of
privilege no per&s;on complained of was ever taken into
cu&s;tody, until after he had been fully heard in his defence:
that this was literally prejudging the cau&s;e before it had
been examined; and the oppre&s;&s;ion was the greater, as the
alledged offence con&s;i&s;ted entirely of words, of which no
<PB N="291" REF="299">
complaint or information had been made for above eight
months after the &s;uppo&s;ed offence had been committed;
and, even then, not till an accu&s;ation had been lodged
again&s;t the informant, upon the trial of which accu&s;ation
the per&s;ons informed again&s;t might very probably be the
mo&s;t material witne&s;&s;es. They ob&s;erved, that in one of
the highe&s;t offences which can be committed by words,
namely, that of denying the King's right to the crown,
or renouncing the Trinity, the information mu&s;t be brought
in three or four days after the words are &s;poken; the words
mu&s;t be proved to have been &s;poken maliciou&s;ly, direct|ly,
and advi&s;edly, and the pro&s;ecution mu&s;t commence in
three months after the information. The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions
made no more impre&s;&s;ion than if they had been uttered in
a de&s;ert. Tho&s;e who were &s;ecure in their number a&s;&s;erted
that the Hou&s;e of Commons was not re&s;tricted by the forms
of proceedings at common law; and that it was nece&s;&s;ary
to vindicate their own honour and dignity, by making ex|amples
of tho&s;e who &s;eemed to hold them in contempt.
Mr. Murray was committed to the cu&s;tody of the &s;erjeant
at arms, and found bail; and Gib&s;on was &s;ent pri&s;oner to
Newgate, from whence he was in a few days relea&s;ed, upon
pre&s;enting an humble petition, profe&s;&s;ing his &s;orrow for
having incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Hou&s;e, to the bar
of which he was brought, and received a reprimand on his
knees from the Speaker. In the mean time, divers wit|ne&s;&s;es
being examined before the Hou&s;e, declared. That
Mr. Murray had been &s;een, about the time of the return of
a member for We&s;tmin&s;ter, heading and exciting a tumult
to acts of violence again&s;t the high-bailiff. The majority,
therefore, after a long and warm debate, agreed, That for
his dangerous and &s;editous practices, in violation and con|tempt
of the privileges of the Hou&s;e, and of the freedom of
elections, he &s;hould be committed clo&s;e pri&s;oner to New|gate.
Then, in the clo&s;e of another violent debate, they
re&s;olved, That he &s;hould be brought to the bar of the
Hou&s;e, to receive that &s;entence on his knees. He accord|ingly
appeared, and being directed by the Speaker to kneel,
<PB N="292" REF="300">
refu&s;ed to comply. He knew that he could not be di&s;|charged
from Newgate during the &s;e&s;&s;ion, without petition|ing,
acknowledging his offence, and making &s;uch con|ce&s;&s;ions
as he thought would imply a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
guilt: he con&s;idered this whole tran&s;action as an oppre&s;&s;ive
exertion of arbitrary power, and, being appri&s;ed of the
extent of their authority, determined to bear the brunt of
their indignation, rather than make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions which he
deemed beneath the dignity of his character. When he
refu&s;ed to humble him&s;elf the whole hou&s;e was in commo|tion;
he was no &s;ooner removed from the war than they
re&s;olved, That his having in a mo&s;t in&s;olent and audacious
manner refu&s;ed to be on his knees at the bar of that Hou&s;e, in
con&s;equence of their former re&s;olution, was a high and
mo&s;t dangerous contempt of the authority and privilege of
the Commons: it was, therefore, ordered, that he &s;hould be
committed clo&s;e pri&s;oner to Newgate, debarred the u&s;e of
pen, ink, and paper; and that no per&s;on &s;hould have acce&s;s
to him, without the leave of the Hou&s;e. Finally, a committee
wes appointed to con&s;ider what methods might be proper to
be taken by them, in relation to this in&s;tance of contempt.
Mean while, the petitioners again&s;t the return made by the
high-bailiff, perceiving the temper of the Hou&s;e, and the
complexion of the majority, withdrew their petition; and
the order which had pa&s;&s;ed for hearing the merits of the
election was di&s;charged. Mr. Murray being taken dan|gerou&s;ly
ill in Newgate, application was made to the Com|mons,
by &s;ome of his relations, that he might be removed
to a more convenient &s;ituation; and his phy&s;ician being
examined, gave it as his opinion that he was infected
with the gaol di&s;temper. Upon this repre&s;entation the
Hou&s;e agreed that the Speaker &s;hould i&s;&s;ue a Warrant for
removing him from Newgate to the cu&s;tody of the &s;erjeant
at arms; but this favour he refu&s;ed to accept, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed
the warme&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e relations who
had applied to the Commons in his behalf. Thus he re|mained
&s;eque&s;tered even from his own brother and &s;i&s;ter,
under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Commons of England, who
<PB N="293" REF="301">
conde&s;cended &s;o far as to make re&s;olutions touching the
phy&s;ician,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1751.</NOTE> apothecary, and nur&s;e who attended this pri|&s;oner.
But the prorogation of parliament having put an
end to their authority for that &s;e&s;&s;ion, Mr. Murray was
di&s;charged of cour&s;e, and conducted by the &s;heriffs from
Newgate to his own hou&s;e, in proce&s;&s;ion, with flags and
&s;treamers, exhibiting the emblems of liberty.</P>
<P>&sect; LV. In the month of June the &s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed with
a &s;peech from the throne, in which his Maje&s;ty thanked
both Hou&s;es for the zeal and affection they had manife&s;ted
towards him and his government; and congratulated the
Commons in particular, upon their firmne&s;s and prudence
in reducing the intere&s;t of the national debt, a mea&s;ure as
agreeable to him as e&s;&s;ential to the &s;trength and welfare of
the kingdom<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">One of the mo&s;t remarkable acts which pa&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;|&s;ion, was that for regulating the commencement of the year, and correcting the calendar, according to the Gregorian computation, which had been adopted by all the other nations in Europe. By this new law it was de|creed that the new year &s;hould begin on the fir&s;t day of January; and that eleven intermediate nominal days, between the &s;econd and fourteenth days of September, 1752, &s;hould for that time be omitted, &s;o that the day &s;uc|ceeding the &s;econd &s;hould be denominated the fourteenth of that month. By this e&s;tabli&s;hment of the new &s;tile, the equinoxes and &s;ol&s;tices will hap|pen nearly on the &s;ame nominal days on which they fell in the year 325, at the council of Nice; and the corre&s;pondence between the Engli&s;h mer|chants and tho&s;e of foreign countries will be greatly facilitated, with re&s;|pect to the dates of letters and accounts.</NOTE>.&mdash;The interior oeconomy of Great-Britain

di&s;grace upon the morals and the polity of the nation. Ra|pine

THE royal family of England had &s;u&s;tained
three &s;evere &s;hocks in the compa&s;s of a few
months. Be&s;ides the lo&s;s of the Prince of Wales, which
the nation lamented as irreparable, his maje&s;ty was deeply
afflicted by the untimely death of his younge&s;t daughter,
the Queen of Denmark, who died at Copenhagen, on the
nineteenth day of December, in the prime of youth. She
was one of the mo&s;t amiable prince&s;&s;es of the age in which
&s;he lived, whether we con&s;ider the virtues of her heart, or
the accompli&s;hments of her per&s;on; generous, mild, and
tender-hearted; beloved even almo&s;t to adoration by her
royal con&s;ort, to whom &s;he had borne a prince and two
prince&s;&s;es; and univer&s;ally admired and revered by the
&s;ubjects of his Dani&s;h Maje&s;ty. Her death had been pre|ceeded
about two months by that of her brother-in-law, the
Prince of Orange, no le&s;s regretted by the natives of the
United Provinces, for his candour, integrity, and heredita|ry
love to his country. Though he had not di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf by the lu&s;tre of a &s;uperior genius, he had been at
great pains to cultivate his under&s;tanding, and &s;tudy the
true intere&s;t of that community of which he was a mem|ber.
He had always approved him&s;elf a good and zealous
citizen, and, &s;ince his elevation to the &s;tadtholder&s;hip,
taken many &s;alutary &s;teps for the advantage of his country.
Among other excellent &s;chemes which he &s;ugge&s;ted, he
left a noble plan with the States-General for re&s;toring their
commerce to its former lu&s;tre, and lived long enough to
receive their warme&s;t acknowledgements for this la&s;t proof
of his prudence and patrioti&s;m. His &s;on and daughter
being both infants, the admini&s;tration of the government
devolved upon the prince&s;s, as gouvernante during her &s;on's
minority; and as &s;uch &s;he &s;ucc$eded to all the power
which her hu&s;band had enjoyed.</P>
<P>&sect; II. With re&s;pect to the affairs of the continent, the
peace of the North &s;eemed &s;till as precarious as ever: for
though the difference between Ru&s;&s;ia and Sweden had been
compromi&s;ed, the mutual di&s;gu&s;t between the Czarina and
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had gained &s;uch acce&s;&s;ion from recipro|cal
<PB N="297" REF="305">
in&s;ults, ill offices, and inflammatory declarations, that
the&s;e two powers &s;eemed to be on the eve of a rupture, and
each was employed in making extraordinary preparations
for war. The courts of Vienna and Great-Britain, fore|&s;eeing
that &s;uch a rupture would embroil the empire, and
rai&s;e in&s;urmountable ob&s;tructions to their favourite &s;cheme
of electing the Archduke Jo&s;eph king of the Romans,
re&s;olved to employ all their influence, in order to effect a
reconciliation between the courts of Peter&s;burgh and
Berlin. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty had &s;ignified to the King of
Great-Britain, and the States-General, the &s;ituation in
which he &s;tood with the Czarina, and &s;ollicited their inter|po&s;ition,
that the difference might be amicably accommo|dated.
At the &s;ame time, he &s;ent an envoy extraordinary
to Ver&s;ailles, to negociate with the French King a very
con&s;iderable body of auxiliaries, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be at|tacked.
The&s;e circum&s;tances induced the Maritime
Powers, and the court of Vienna, to u&s;e their utmo&s;t en|deavours
for the prevention of a rupture; and accordingly
they made remon&s;trances on this &s;ubject by their mini&s;ters
at Peter&s;burgh, propo&s;ing that the quarrel &s;hould be ter|minated
without blood&s;hed, and all cau&s;e of animo&s;ity be
buried in oblivion.</P>
<P>&sect; III. In the mean time, they eagerly pro&s;ecuted the
de&s;ign of the election; and the Imperial mini&s;ter at Berlin
not only communicated to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty the &s;enti|ments
of the King of England on this expedient, but even
&s;ollicited his vote for the Archduke Jo&s;eph, when the
election of a king of the Romans &s;hould be propo&s;ed
in the electoral college. To this propo&s;al he replied,
That he was extremely well di&s;po&s;ed to manife&s;t his re|gard
for their Imperial Maje&s;ties, and to give them mo&s;t
genuine proofs of it, even in the propo&s;ed election of a
king of the Romans, con&s;idering the great merit of the
pre&s;ent candidate, the Archduke Jo&s;eph: but he left it to
the con&s;ideration of their Imperial Maje&s;ties, whether the
election would not be a little premature, if tran&s;acted at a
time when his Imperial Maje&s;ty was in the flower of his
<PB N="298" REF="306">
age, enjoying perfect health; and when all Europe, parti|cularly
the Empire, was hu&s;hed in the bo&s;om of tran|quility,
&s;o that no circum&s;tance &s;eemed to progno&s;ticate
the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch an election; or of putting in executi|on
the motives mentioned in the capitulation of the reign|ing
Emperor's election; e&s;pecially, as the examination of
the&s;e motives belonged to the whole Empire, and ought to
precede the election, by virtue of the eighth article of the
treaty of We&s;tphalia. He ob&s;erved, that, in ca&s;e of the
Emperor's death, Germany would find her&s;elf in a very
di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, under the government of a minor.
For the&s;e rea&s;ons, he &s;aid, he could not help advi&s;ing their
Imperial Maje&s;ties to wait until the Archduke &s;hould be
of age, when his election might be carried on more con|formably
to the laws and con&s;titution of the Empire, and
more &s;uitable to the maje&s;ty of the whole Germanick body.
This reply he circulated among the electors, and in par|ticular
tran&s;mitted it to the King of Great-Britain, de|&s;iring
they would deliberate maturely on this &s;ubject, and
confer together in a body, as well as in private, that they
might proceed according to the ancient cu&s;tom of the
electoral college, and take &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hould be judg|ed
expedient for the honour and advantage of the commu|nity.
This circular letter was an&s;wered both by the King
of England and the Elector of Bavaria, who demon&s;trated,
that it was the privilege of the electoral college only, with|out
any participation of the other princes of the Empire, to
elect a king of the Romans during the life of the Emperor,
in order to maintain the peace and pre&s;erve the liberties of
Germany; and that the neglect of this wi&s;e precaution hath
produced bloody wars, and many fatal con&s;equences to the
Empire. They ob&s;erved, that nothing could more contri|bute
to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the publick tranquillity than this
mea&s;ure, &s;o ardently de&s;ired by the majority of the German$
princes; and that, although the Archduke Jo&s;eph wanted
a few years of being of age, and it might po&s;&s;ibly happen
that the reigning Emperor &s;hould die during that prince's
minority, yet it would be much le&s;s prejudicial to the Em|pire
<PB N="299" REF="307">
to have a minor chief, than to &s;ee the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion alto|gether
un&s;ettled. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty received a declara|tion
to the &s;ame purpo&s;e from the elector of Mentz; and
under&s;tanding that this prince, as arch-chancellor of the
Empire, intended to convoke an electoral diet, in order to
propo&s;e the election of the king of the Romans, he wrote
an elaborate letter to his Electoral Highne&s;s, explaining at
more length his rea&s;ons for po&s;tponing the election. He
quoted that &s;entence of the treaty of We&s;tphalia which ex|pre&s;ly
declares, that the election of the king of the Ro|mans
&s;hall be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and ordained by the common con|&s;ent
of the &s;tates of the empire; and, therefore, he could
not conceive what right the electoral college had to arro|gate
this privilege to them&s;elves, excluding the other &s;tates
of the Empire. He ob&s;erved, that the Imperial capitulati|ons,
which were the only laws of the Empire that treated of
this &s;ubject, mentioned only three ca&s;es in which it was
lawful to proceed to &s;uch an election; namely, the Empe|$or's
leaving and long ab&s;ence from Germany; his advanc|ed
age, or an indi&s;po&s;ition, rendering him incapable of
managing the reins of government; and any ca&s;e of emer|gency
in which the pre&s;ervation of the Empire's pro&s;perity
$s intere&s;ted. He affirmed, that none of the&s;e motives at
$re&s;ent exi&s;ted: that, in ca&s;e the Imperial crown &s;hould
$evolve to a minor, many mi&s;chiefs and di&s;orders mu&s;t
$n&s;ue, as the con&s;titutions of the Empire have e&s;tabli&s;hed
$o regulations nor regency in that event: that an electi|$n
of this nature, carried on under the power, influence,
$nd authority of the head of the Empire, would &s;trike at
he fundamental privileges of the princes and &s;tates; con|$equently,
in time overturn the con&s;titution of the Em|$ire,
which, from being an elective dignity, conferred by
$he free and independent &s;uffrages of the electoral college
$nd &s;tates of Germany, under certain capitulations,
$bliging the prince thus cho&s;en to govern according to
$aw, would become an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, perpetu|$$ed
in one family, which, of cour&s;e, mu&s;t be aggran|$i&s;ed
to the prejudice of its co-e&s;tates, and the ruin of
$he Germanick liberties. In a word, all Germany in ge|neral,
<PB N="300" REF="308">
and Rati&s;bon in particular, was filled with wri|tings
publi&s;hed on both &s;ides, by the Emperor and
his adherents, to demon&s;trate that the election of a
king of the Romans, during the life of the Emperor, had
often happened, and at this pre&s;ent time was nece&s;&s;ary,
and would be advantageous to the Empire: while the King
of Pru&s;&s;ia and his friends laboured to prove that &s;uch an
election, at the pre&s;ent juncture, would be ill-timed, irre|gular,
and of dangerous con&s;equence. Perhaps, if the
truth was known, this enterpri&s;ing prince had projected
&s;ome great &s;cheme, with the execution of which this pro|po&s;ed
e&s;tabli&s;hment would have interfered. Certain it is,
he exerted him&s;elf with that &s;pirit and per&s;everance which
are peculiar to his character to fru&s;trate the intention of
the courts of Vienna and London in this particular, and
was a&s;&s;i&s;ted with all the intrigue of the French mini&s;try.
Their joint endeavours were &s;o effectual, that the Elector
of Cologn renounced his &s;ub&s;idiary treaty with the Mari|time
Powers, and once more threw him&s;elf into the arms of
France. The Elector Palatine being &s;ollicited by the Em|pre&s;s-Queen
and his Britannick Maje&s;ty to co-operate
with their views, in&s;i&s;ted, as a preliminary article, upon
being indemnified by the court of Vienna for the ravages
committed in his territories by the Au&s;trian troops, dur|ing
the cour&s;e of the la&s;t war: the King of Poland,
Elector of Saxony, made the &s;ame demand of the like
indemnification, which was granted by the mediation
of King George; and then he &s;ub&s;cribed to a &s;ub&s;i|dy-treaty,
obliging him&s;elf to furni&s;h a body of &s;ix
thou&s;and auxiliaries, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be required by
the Maritime Powers; and to act as elector, in con|cert
with the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, in every thing relating to
the welfare of his country that &s;hould &s;quare with the
fundamental laws of the Empire. The courts of London
and Vienna had this election &s;o much at heart, that they
&s;ounded almo&s;t all the powers of Europe, to know how
they &s;tood affected towards the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed. The
King of Spain declined intermeddling in a dome&s;tick affai$
of the Empire. The French King returned an ambiguou$
an&s;wer; from whence it was concluded, that nothing bu$
<PB N="301" REF="309">
oppo&s;ition could be expected from that quarter. The
Swedi&s;h monarch was rendered propitious to the project,
by a&s;&s;urances that the Hou&s;e of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, of which he
was the head, &s;hould be elevated into an electorate. They
even endeavoured to &s;often his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, by con|&s;enting,
at la&s;t that the treaty of Dre&s;den, confirming to
him the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sile&s;ia, &s;hould be guaranteed by the
diet of th Empire; a &s;anction which he now actually ob|tained,
together with the ratification of his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty.
Notwith&s;tanding this indulgence, he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted
in rai&s;ing fre&s;h objections to the favourite project, on pre|tence
of concerting mea&s;ures for preventing the inconve|niences
that might re&s;ult from a minority; for regulating
the capitulations to be agreed on with the King of the Ro|mans;
&s;ecuring the freedom of future elections, and pre|&s;erving
the prerogatives and privileges of the Germanick
body in all its members. In con&s;equence of the&s;e ob&s;tacles,
joined to the apo&s;tacy of the Elector of Cologn, the ob&s;ti|nacy
of the Elector Palatine, and the approaching diet of
Hungary, at which their Imperial Maje&s;ties were obliged
per&s;onally to pre&s;ide, the mea&s;ures for the election were
&s;u&s;pended till next &s;ummer, when his Britannick Maje&s;ty
was expected at Hanover, to put the fini&s;hing &s;troke to
this great event in favour of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. Another di&s;appointment with re&s;pect to this
election the promoters of it &s;u&s;tained in the death of his
Swedi&s;h Maje&s;ty, who expired in a good old age, and
was &s;ucceeded by Adolphus Frederick, Duke of Hol&s;tein
Eutin, Bi&s;hop of Lubeck, upon whom the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion had
been &s;ettled for &s;ome years, by the unanimous concurrence
of the &s;tates of the kingdom. This prince a&s;cended the
$hrone of Sweden without the lea&s;t di&s;turbance; and, of
his own accord, took an oath in full &s;enate, that he would
never attempt to introduce a de&s;potick authority; but
maintain their liberties with his blood, and govern his
$ubjects in all re&s;pects according to the laws, and the
form of government e&s;tabli&s;hed in Sweden. This publick
act, which was communicated to all the foreign mini&s;ters,
<PB N="302" REF="310">
and particularly to the envoy from Peter&s;burgh, met with
&s;uch a favourable reception from the Czarina, that &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed
her &s;atisfaction in a publick declaration; and the
good under&s;tanding between the two courts was perfectly
re&s;tored.</P>
<P>&sect; V. When the parliament of England was opened,
in the month of November, the King, in his &s;peech from
the throne, gave them to under&s;tand, That, for the &s;ame
purpo&s;es which &s;ugge&s;ted the treaty with the Elector of
Bavaria, he had now, in conjunction with the States-Gene|ral,
concluded another with the King of Poland, Elector
of Saxony. He told them, that the unfortunate death of
the Prince of Orange had made no alteration in the &s;tate
of affairs in Holland; and that he had received the &s;trong|e&s;t
a&s;&s;urances from the States, of their firm re&s;olution to
maintain the intimate union and friend&s;hip happily &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting
between his Maje&s;ty and tho&s;e ancient and natural
allies of his crown. He exhorted both Hou&s;es to con&s;ider
&s;eriou&s;ly of &s;ome effectual provi&s;ions, to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e au|dacious
crimes of robbery and violence, grown &s;o frequent
about the capital, proceeding in a great mea&s;ure from that
profligate &s;pirit of irreligion, idlene&s;s, gaming, and extra|vagance,
which had of late extended it&s;elf in an uncom|mon
degree, to the di&s;honour of the nation, and the great
offence and prejudice of the &s;ober and indu&s;trious part of
the people. The paragraphs of this &s;peech were, as u&s;ual,
ecchoed back to the throne in addre&s;&s;es, replete with ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of loyalty, affection, and approbation. Oppo&s;i|tion
was by this time almo&s;t extingui&s;hed; and the pro|ceedings
of both Hou&s;es took place with &s;uch unanimity
as was hardly ever known before this period in a Briti&s;h
parliament. The Commons, however, &s;eem to have
a&s;&s;embled with &s;uch &s;entiments as did no great honour to
their temper and magnanimity. In a few days after the
&s;e&s;&s;ion opened, Lord Vi&s;count C&mdash;e, a young nobleman,
who&s;e character entitled him to very little regard or
influence among men of &s;en&s;e and probity, made a motion,
that Mr. Murray, who had been &s;o &s;everely per&s;ecuted in
<PB N="303" REF="311">
the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion for refu&s;ing to humble him&s;elf on his knees
before them, &s;hould be again committed clo&s;e pri&s;oner to
Newgate for the &s;ame offence. This propo&s;al, which
&s;uppo&s;ed a power that the Commons had never before ex|erci&s;ed,
was &s;harply di&s;puted by the Earl of Eg&mdash;t,
and others, who had not re&s;igned all &s;en&s;e of modera|tion;
but the majority adopted the mea&s;ure with great
eagerne&s;s, and the Speaker was ordered to i&s;&s;ue his war|rant
accordingly. Then the Hou&s;e re&s;olved, That the
&s;aid Alexander Murray &s;hould receive the &s;entence, for
his now being committed clo&s;e pri&s;oner to his Maje&s;ty's
gaol of Newgate, at the bar of the Hou&s;e, upon his knees;
and the &s;erjeant at arms was commanded to take him into
cu&s;tody for this purpo&s;e. Their indignation, however, was
eluded by the caution of the delinquent, who, having fore|&s;een
the effects of their re&s;entment, had prudently retired to
another country. They determined, neverthele&s;s, to pro|ceed
again&s;t him as a per&s;on of &s;ome con&s;equence in the
commonwealth; for, being informed of his retreat, they
conde&s;cended &s;o far as to pre&s;ent an addre&s;s to his Ma|je&s;ty,
de&s;iring that his royal proclamation might be i&s;&s;ued
for apprehending the &s;aid Mr. Murray, promi&s;ing a re|ward
to him who &s;hould have the good fortune to appre|hend
this fugitive&mdash;a reque&s;t with which his Maje&s;ty mo&s;t
graciou&s;ly complied.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. Nor was this the only addre&s;s pre&s;ented to the
King upon &s;uch an important &s;ubject. A pamphlet, in|tituled,
&startq;The Ca&s;e of the Hon. Alexander Murray,
E&s;quire, in an Appeal to the people of Great-Britain,&endq;
was fir&s;t &s;tigmatized in a complaint to the Hou&s;e, and af|terwards
produced, and read at the table. The piece was
written with great acrimony, and abounded with &s;evere
animadver&s;ions, not only upon the conduct of the return|ing
officer, but al&s;o on the proceedings of the Commons.
The violent members immediately took fire, and the
flame extended it&s;elf to the majority. Nay, the Hou&s;e
unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, That the pamphlet was an impu|dent,
malicious, &s;candalous, and &s;editious libel, fal&s;ely and
<PB N="304" REF="312">
mo&s;t injuriou&s;ly reflecting upon, and a&s;per&s;ing the proceed|ings
of the Hou&s;e, tending to create mi&s;apprehen&s;ions in
the minds of the people, to the great di&s;honour of the
&s;aid Hou&s;e, and in violation of the privileges thereof.
They furthermore pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the King, de|&s;iring
his Maje&s;ty would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to give
directions to his attorney-general to pro&s;ecute the authors
or author, the printers or printer, and the publi&s;hers or
publi&s;her of the &s;aid &s;candalous libel, that they might be
brought to condign puni&s;hment. Directions were accord|ingly
given for this purpo&s;e, and a pro&s;ecution commenced
again&s;t the publi&s;her, who had &s;ome rea&s;on to be di&s;mayed,
con&s;idering the great weight of influence he was doomed
to encounter&mdash;influence ari&s;ing from a pro&s;ecution of the
crown, in&s;tituted at the reque&s;t, and founded on a vote
of the Hou&s;e of Commons. Neverthele&s;s, when the cau&s;e
was heard before the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of England, a
jury of free-born Engli&s;hmen, citizens of London, a&s;&s;ert|ed
their privilege of judging the law as well as the fact,
and acquitted the defendant with a truly admirable &s;pirit
of independency. They con&s;idered the pamphlet as an
appeal again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion; and, convinced that the con|tents
were true, they could not in con&s;cience adjudge it a
fal&s;e libel, even though it had been &s;o declared by one of
the branches of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The Commons, in regulating the &s;upplies of
the en&s;uing year, voted the continuation of eighteen thou|&s;and
eight hundred and fifty-&s;even men for the land-&s;er|vice,
though not without &s;ome oppo&s;ition from certain
patriots, who, rather from a &s;en&s;e of duty than from any
hope of influencing the majority, affirmed, that &s;ixteen
thou&s;and men, in time of peace, would an&s;wer all the ends
propo&s;ed by a &s;tanding army. The number of &s;eamen
was fixed at ten thou&s;and; large &s;ums were granted to
make up deficiencies, and fulfill the engagements of the
crown with the Electors of Bavaria and Saxony, as well
as for the maintenance of Nova-Scotia and Georgia, and
the ca&s;tles on the coa&s;t of Guinea; and one hundred and
<PB N="305" REF="313">
twelve thou&s;and one hundred and fifty-two pounds, three
&s;hillings, and three-pence were voted, as a full compen&s;ation
to the old royal African company for their exclu&s;ive charter
and property, to be applied for the relief of their creditors<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e expen&s;es were de&s;rayed by a continuation of the duties on ma$t, &amp;c. a-land tax at three &s;hillings in the pound; a duty on licen&s;es to be yearly paid by pawnbrokers and dealers in &s;econd-hand goods, within the bills of mortality; the &s;um of one million four hundred thou&s;and pounds, advanced by the Bank, according to a propo&s;al made for that purpo&s;e; five hundred thou&s;and pounds to be i&s;&s;ued from the &s;inking fund; a duty laid on gum &s;enaga; and the continuation of divers other occa&s;ional impo&s;itions. The grants for the year amounted to &s;omething le&s;s than four millions, and the provi&s;ions made for this expen&s;e exceeded it in the &s;um of two hundred &s;eventy-one thou&s;and twenty-four pounds, ten &s;hillings, and &s;ix-pence half-penny.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The laws enacted for the encouragement of
traffick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1752.</NOTE> and the regulations of civil polity, con&s;i&s;ted in an
act for licen&s;ing pawnbrokers, and for the more effectual
preventing the receiving of &s;tolen goods: another for pre|venting
thefts and robberies, by which places of enter|tainment,
dancing, and mu&s;ick in London, We&s;tmin&s;ter,
and within twenty miles of the capital, were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
and prohibited, unle&s;s the proprietors of them could ob|tain
licen&s;es from the ju&s;tices of the peace, empowered
for that purpo&s;e: a third for annexing the forfeited e&s;tates
in Scotland unalienably in the crown, after having made
&s;atisfaction to the lawful creditors; e&s;tabli&s;hing a method
of lea&s;ing the&s;e e&s;tates, and applying the rents and profits
of them to the better civili&s;ing and improving the High|lands,
and preventing future di&s;orders in that part of the
united kingdom. Nothing could be more &s;alutary than
the purpo&s;es of the&s;e regulations. The &s;uburbs of the
metropolis abounded with an incredible number of publick
hou&s;es, which continually re&s;ounded with the noi&s;e of
riot and intemperance: they were the haunts of idlene&s;s,
fraud, and rapine; and the &s;eminaries of drunkenne&s;s,
debauchery, extravagance, and every vice incident to
human nature: yet the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e receptacles
of infamy was attended with an inconvenience, which, in
&s;ome ca&s;es, aro&s;e even to a degree of oppre&s;&s;ion. The
<PB N="306" REF="314">
ju&s;tices being ve&s;ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1752.</NOTE> by the legi&s;lature, with the power of
granting or refu&s;ing licen&s;es, were con&s;tituted, in effect,
the arbiters on who&s;e deci&s;ion the fortunes and livelihood
of many individuals ab&s;olutely depended. Many of tho&s;e
who exerci&s;ed this &s;pecies of magi&s;tracy within the bills
of mortality were, to the reproach of government, men of
profligate lives, needy, mean, ignorant, and rapacious,
and often acted from the mo&s;t &s;candalous principles of
&s;elfi&s;h avarice</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The law relating to the Highlands of Scotland
was well calculated for promoting, among the inhabitants
of that country, &s;uch a &s;pirit of indu&s;try as might detach
them from their dangerous connexions, and gradually
&s;uper&s;ede that military genius which has been &s;o productive
of danger and alarm to the &s;outhern parts of Great-Bri|tain.
The King, by this act, was empowered to appoint
commi&s;&s;ioners for managing the forfeited e&s;tates; who were
&eacute;nabled to grant lea&s;es of &s;mall farms, not above twenty
pounds a-year, to individuals, who &s;hould take an oath to
government to re&s;ide upon and cultivate the lands thus
let. It was al&s;o provided, that no lea&s;e &s;hould be granted
for a longer term than twenty-one years; and that the
le&s;&s;es &s;hould not pay above three-fourths of the annual
value. Although the&s;e forfeited e&s;tates were generally
encumbered with claims beyond their real value, and the
act directed that they &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of by publick &s;ale;
yet, as they lay in the mo&s;t di&s;affected parts of the High|lands,
it was thought nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould remain in
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown, becau&s;e, in ca&s;e of their
being publickly &s;old, they might be purcha&s;ed in tru&s;t for
the families of the per&s;ons by whom they were forfeited,
and thus the &s;pirit of di&s;affection would &s;till &s;urvive. A
valuation, therefore, was made by the court of &s;e&s;&s;ion in
Scotland, at the joint &s;uit of the crown and the creditors;
and the value being a&s;certained, the ju&s;t claimants were
paid out of the next aids granted by parliament. The
bill met with con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of
Peers from the Duke of Bed&s;ord and the Earl of Bath,
<PB N="307" REF="315">
who probably fore&s;aw that the good effects of this &s;cheme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1752.</NOTE>
&s;o laudable in it&s;elf, would be fru&s;trated in the execution;
and that the act, in&s;tead of an&s;wering the purpo&s;es for
which it was intended, would &s;erve only as a job to gra|tify
the rapacious retainers to the government, and their
emi&s;&s;aries, in that country. After a warm debate, how|ever,
it was adopted by a great majority, and obtained
the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>&sect; X. A third law related to certain articles of the
national debt, which were now converted into &s;everal
joint &s;tocks of annuities, transferable at the Bank of
England, to be charged on the &s;inking-fund. A great
number of different funds for annuities, e&s;tabli&s;hed at dif|ferent
times, and by different acts, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at this pe|riod;
&s;o that it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep many different ac|counts,
which could not be regulated without con&s;ider|able
trouble and expen&s;e, for the removal of which the
bill was calculated.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. In con&s;equence of petitions from the woollen
manufacturers of We&s;tmorland and York&s;hire, two bills
were brought in, and pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es, by
which the ports of Lanca&s;ter and Great Yarmouth were
opened for the importation of wool and woollen yarn from
Ireland; but why this privilege was not extended to all
the frequented ports of the kingdom it is not ea&s;y to con|ceive,
without &s;uppo&s;ing a little national jealou&s;y on one
hand, and a great deal of grievous re&s;traint on the other.
Over and above the&s;e new laws, &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful endea|vours
were u&s;ed in behalf of commerce and police. A
bill was offered for laying further re&s;trictions on pawn|brokers
and brokers, that they might no longer &s;uck the
blood of the poor, and act as the acce&s;&s;aries of theft and
robbery, which was canva&s;&s;ed, debated, and made its
way through the Lower Hou&s;e; but the Lords rejected
it as a crude &s;cheme, which they could not amend, be|cau&s;e
it was a money-bill, not cognizable by their Hou&s;e,
without engaging in a di&s;pute with the Commons. Ano|ther
bill was prepared, for giving power to change the pu|ni&s;hment

of felony, in certain ca&s;es, to confinement and
hard labour in dock-yards or garri&s;ons. It was the opi|nion
of many who wi&s;hed well to their country, and were
properly qualified to pro&s;ecute &s;uch enquiries, that the
practice of con&s;igning &s;uch a number of wretches to the
hands of the executioner &s;erved only, by its frequency,
to defeat the purpo&s;e of the law, in robbing death of all
its terrour, and the publick of many &s;ubjects, who might,
notwith&s;tanding their delinquency, be in &s;ome mea&s;ure
rendered u&s;eful to &s;ociety. Such was the motive that
influenced the promoters of this bill; by which it was
propo&s;ed, in imitation of that oeconomy practi&s;ed in other
countries, to confine felons convicted under certain cir|cum&s;tances
to hard labour upon the publick works of
the kingdom. The &s;cheme was adopted by the Lower
Hou&s;e, but rejected by the Lords, who &s;eemed apprehen|&s;ive
of its bringing &s;uch di&s;credit upon his Maje&s;ty's dock-yards
as would di&s;courage per&s;ons who valued their repu|tation
from engaging in &s;uch employment. Of &s;till
greater importance to the nation was the next mea&s;ure
propo&s;ed, in a bill for making the militia of England
more u&s;eful, pre&s;ented by Mr. Thornton, a gentleman
of York&s;hire, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his loyalty
and patrioti&s;m. It was canva&s;&s;ed in a committee of the
whole Hou&s;e, and underwent divers amendments; but
mi&s;carried, through the aver&s;ion of the mini&s;try to any
project tending to remove or le&s;&s;en the nece&s;&s;ity of main|taining
a &s;tanding army. A con&s;iderable number of peti|tions
for different regulations, in re&s;pect to commerce and
convenience of traffick, were pre&s;ented, con&s;idered, and
left upon the table. A remon&s;trance from the pri&s;oners
confined in the jail of the King's-Bench, complaining
of their mi&s;erable &s;ituation, ari&s;ing from want of room,
and other conveniences, being taken into con&s;ideration
by a committee, among other evidences, they examined
that remarkable per&s;onage who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf in
different parts of Chri&s;tendom, under the name of Theo|dore
King of Cor&s;ica. Though formerly countenanced,
<PB N="309" REF="317">
and even treated as a &s;overeign prince by the Briti&s;h
mini&s;try, he was now reduced to the forlorn condition of
a confined debtor; and, to the reproach of this king|dom,
died in pri&s;on, &s;urrounded with all the mi&s;ery of
indigence, and overwhelmed with the infirmities of old
age. But the mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance of the par|liamentary
tran&s;actions that di&s;tingui&s;hed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was
a motion made in both Hou&s;es for an addre&s;s to the King,
be&s;eeching his Maje&s;ty, That in time of publick tran|quillity
he would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to avoid entering
into &s;ub&s;idiary treaties with foreign princes, which are &s;o
burthen&s;ome to this nation. This extraordinary propo|&s;al
was made and &s;trenuou&s;ly urged by the Duke of B&mdash;,
and a vehement debate en&s;ued, in which the Earls of G&mdash;,
S&mdash;, and H&mdash;, oppo&s;ed it with an exertion of &s;uperior
abilities; and the que&s;tion being put, was carried in the
negative, without a divi&s;ion. The &s;ame fate attended it
in the Hou&s;e of Commons, where it was introduced by
Lord H&mdash;y, and &s;upported by &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed ora|tors.
The &s;e&s;&s;ion ended in the latter end of March, when
his Maje&s;ty, having given his a&s;&s;ent to ninety-five publick
and private bills, harangued both Hou&s;es and prorogued
the parliament<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Among the proceedings of this &s;e&s;&s;ion it may not be improper to men|tion a new act for the prevention of murders, which had been &s;hockingly frequent of late, importing, That every criminal convicted of this horrid crime &s;hould be executed in one day after his &s;entence, and his body deli|vered to the &s;urgeons for di&s;&s;ection&mdash;an expedient which hath been found productive of very &s;alutary con&s;equences.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. Immediately after the prorogation the King
appointed a regency, and &s;et out for Hanover, in order
to complete the great &s;cheme he had projected for elect|ing
a king of the Romans. Great-Britain, in the mean
time, produced no event of importance, or any tran&s;action
that de&s;erves hi&s;torical mention, except the ratification of
two treaties of peace and commerce with the &s;tates of
Tripoli and Tunis on the coa&s;t of Barbary, concluded
by the Briti&s;h con&s;uls in tho&s;e cities, under the influence
and au&s;pices of an Engli&s;h &s;quadron, commanded by
<PB N="310" REF="318">
Commodore Keppel, &s;on to the Earl of Albemarle. The
tide of luxury &s;till flowed with an impetuous current,
bearing down all the mounds of temperance and deco|rum;
while fraud and profligacy &s;truck out new chan|nels,
through which they eluded the re&s;trictions of the
law, and all the vigilance of civil policy. New arts of
deception were invented, in order to en&s;nare and ruin the
unwary; and &s;ome infamous practices, in the way of
commerce, were countenanced by per&s;ons of rank and
importance in the commonwealth. A certain member of
parliament was obliged to withdraw him&s;elf from his
country, in con&s;equence of a di&s;covery, by which it ap|peared
that he had contrived and executed &s;chemes for de|&s;troying
his own &s;hips at &s;ea, with a view to defraud the
in&s;urers.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. In the cour&s;e of this year the affairs of the
continent did not undergo any material alteration. In
France the religious di&s;pute concerning the doctrine of
Jan&s;enius &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the clergy and the parlia|ment;
and &s;eemed to acquire additional fuel from the
violence of the Archbi&s;hop of Paris, a haughty turbulent
prelate, who&s;e pride and bigotry were &s;ufficient to embro$l
one half of Chri&s;tendom. The northern powers enjoyed
a perfect tranquillity: the States-General of the United
Provinces were engro&s;&s;ed by plans of national oeconomy.
Spain was intent upon extending her commerce, bringing
her manufactures to perfection, and repre&s;&s;ing the in&s;olence
of the Barbary Cor&s;airs. His Portugue&s;e$ Maje&s;ty endea|voured,
by certain peremptory precautions, to check the
exportation of gold coin from his dominions; and in&s;i&s;ted
upon in&s;pecting the books of the Briti&s;h merchants &s;ettled
at Li&s;bon; but they refu&s;ed to comply with this demand,
which was contrary to a treaty &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two
crowns; and he thought proper to acquie&s;$e in their re|fu&s;al.
He was much better employed in obtaining from
the Pope an abolition of the annual proce&s;&s;ion called the
<HI>Auto da fe,</HI> one of the mo&s;t horrid triumphs of &s;piritual
tyranny. The peace of Italy was &s;ecured by a defen&s;ive
<PB N="311" REF="319">
treaty concluded at Madrid between the Emperor, his
Catholick Maje&s;ty, the King of the Two Sicilies, and the
Duke of Parma; to which treaty the King of Sardinia
afterwards acceded.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. With re&s;pect to the great &s;cheme of electing
the Archduke Jo&s;eph king of the Romans, fre&s;h objec|tions
&s;eemed to ri&s;e from different quarters. The good
under&s;tanding between the courts of Berlin and Hanover
received an additional &s;hock, from a di&s;pute concerning
the property of Ea&s;t Frie&s;eland, which his Pru&s;&s;ian Ma|je&s;ty,
had &s;ecured, as heir to the la&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. His Bri|tannick
Maje&s;ty, as Elector of Hanover, having preten&s;ions
to the &s;ame inheritance, his mini&s;ter delivered a memorial
to the diet of the Empire, a&s;&s;embled at Rati&s;bon, demand|ing
that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, as Elector of Brandenburgh,
&s;hould be referred to the deci&s;ion of the Aulick council, in
regard to his claim to the e&s;tates of Ea&s;t Frie&s;eland: but the
King being already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit his
right to the determination of that or any other tribunal;
and when the diet pre&s;umed to deliberate on this affair,
his envoy entered a &s;trong prote&s;t again&s;t their proceed|ings.
At the &s;ame time, he pre&s;ented the other mini&s;ters
with a memorial, tending to refute the Elector of Ha|nover's
preten&s;ions to the principality in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. At this juncture his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty made no
&s;cruple of expre&s;&s;ing his re&s;entment again&s;t the court of
London, which he &s;eemed to con&s;ider as an officious cabal,
that had no right to intermeddle in the affairs of Germany.
His re&s;ident at London complained to the Briti&s;h mini&s;try,
that divers &s;hips, &s;ailing under the Pru&s;&s;ian flag, had been
&s;topped at &s;ea, and even &s;ei&s;ed, by Engli&s;h crui&s;ers; and
that his &s;ubjects had been ill-treated and oppre&s;&s;ed: he,
therefore, demanded reparation in a peremptory tone;
and, in the mean time, di&s;continued the payment of the
Sile&s;ia loan, which he had charged him&s;elf with, by an
article in the treaty of Bre&s;lau. This was a &s;um of money
amounting to two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds,
which the Emperor Charles VI. father of the reigning
<PB N="312" REF="320">
Empre&s;s, had borrowed of the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain,
on condition of paying an intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent. and
mortgaging the &s;ilver mines of Sile&s;ia for the repayment
of the principal. The&s;e devolved to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia
with this incumbrance, and he continued to pay the in|tere&s;t
punctually till this juncture, when the payment was
&s;topped; and he publi&s;hed a paper, intituled, &startq;An Expo&s;i|tion
of the Motives which influenced his Conduct on this
Occa&s;ion.&endq; In his memorial to the mini&s;try of Great-Britain
he alledged, That eighteen Pru&s;&s;ian &s;hips, and
thirty-three neutral ve&s;&s;els, in which the &s;ubjects of Pru&s;|&s;ia
were concerned, had been unju&s;tly &s;ei&s;ed by Engli&s;h
privateers: his account of damages amounted to a very
con&s;iderable &s;um; and he demanded, in the mo&s;t dogmatick
terms, that the affair &s;hould be finally di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the
term of three months from the date of his remon&s;trance.
The expo&s;ition and memorial were &s;ubjected to the exa|mination
of the able&s;t civilians in England, who refuted
every article of the charge with equal preci&s;ion and per|&s;picuity.
They proved, that captures by &s;ea fell properly
under the cognizance of tho&s;e powers under who&s;e juri&s;|diction
the &s;ei&s;ures were made; and, therefore, his Pru&s;|&s;ian
Maje&s;ty could not, con&s;i&s;tent with the law of nations,
determine the&s;e di&s;putes in his own tribunals. They de|mon&s;trated,
by undoubted evidence, the fal&s;ity of many
facts alledged in the memorial, as well as the fairne&s;s of
the proceedings by which &s;ome few of the Pru&s;&s;ian ve&s;|&s;els
had been condemned; and made it apear, that no
in&s;ult or injury had been offered to the &s;ubjects of Pru&s;&s;ia.
Finally, they ob&s;erved, that the Sile&s;ia loan was a private
tran&s;action of &s;uch a nature, that, even if a war had hap|pened
between the Emperor Charles VI. and his Britan|nick
Maje&s;ty, this mu&s;t have been held &s;acred and invio|lable:
that when the Empre&s;s-Queen ceded Sile&s;ia to the
King of Pru&s;&s;ia, this monarch charged him&s;elf with the
repayment of the loan, which, being a private debt, and
transferable, was now diffu&s;ed into different countries,
and become the property of many others be&s;ides the &s;ub|jects
<PB N="313" REF="321">
of Great-Britain. They wound up their chain of
$ea&s;oning by ob&s;erving, that, according to agreement
with the Emperor, the whole of this loan &s;hould have
$een repayed in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and
$orty-five; whereas the complaints &s;pecified in the Pru&s;&s;ian
memorial were founded on facts po&s;terior to that period.
Whether his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty was convinced by the&s;e
$$a&s;ons, and de&s;i&s;ted from principle, or thought proper to
$ive up his claim upon other political con&s;iderations;
$ertain it is, he no longer in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;atisfaction, but
ordered the payments of the Sile&s;ia loan to be continued
without further interruption: a report, indeed, was cir|$ulated,
that advantage had been taken of the demur by a
$ertain prince, who employed his agents to buy up great
$art of the loan at a con&s;iderable di&s;count.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. How much &s;oever the King of Pru&s;&s;ia may be
$word$ &s;ubject of cen&s;ure on this occa&s;ion, it mu&s;t be allowed
$$at, with regard to his own &s;ubjects, he acted as a wi&s;e
$$gi&s;lator, and the father of his country. He peopled the
$e&s;erts of Pomerania, by encouraging, with royal boun|$$es,
a great number of indu&s;trious emigrants to &s;ettle in
$$at province; the face of which, in a very few years,
$nderwent the mo&s;t agreeable alteration. Above &s;ixty
$ew villages aro&s;e amid&s;t a barren wa&s;te, and every part
$word$ the country exhibited marks of &s;ucce&s;sful cultivation.
Tho&s;e &s;olitary and de&s;olate plains, where no human foot|$$eps
had for many ages been &s;een, were now converted into
$elds of corn. The farms were regularly farmed out: the
$ou&s;es multiplied, and teemed with population: the happy
$ea&s;ants, &s;heltered in a peculiar manner under their king's
$rotection, &s;owed their grounds in peace, and reaped
$heir harve&s;ts in &s;ecurity. The &s;ame care and indulgence
$ere extended to the unpeopled parts of other provinces
$ithin the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions, and extraordinary en|couragement
was granted to all French prote&s;tants who
$hould come and &s;ettle under the government of this politi|cal
&s;age.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="322">
&sect; XVII. The courts of Vienna and Hanover &s;till em|ployed
their chief attention upon the &s;cheme of electing a
king of the Romans; and the Elector of Mentz, in|fluenced
by the majority of the college, had convoked an
electoral diet for that purpo&s;e: but &s;trong prote&s;ts again&s;t
this convocation were entered by the Electors of Cologn
and Palatine, in&s;omuch that it was thought expedient to
conciliate this la&s;t, by taking &s;ome &s;teps in his favour, with
re&s;pect to the &s;atisfaction he demanded from the Empre&s;s-Queen
and his Britannick Maje&s;ty. His claim upon the
court of Vienna amounted to three millions of florins, by
way of indemnification for the lo&s;&s;es he had &s;u&s;tained during
the war. He demanded of the King of England twenty
thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, for provi&s;ion and forage furni&s;hed
to the Briti&s;h troops while they acted on the Maine; and
the like &s;um for the like purpo&s;es from the States-General
of the United Provinces. The Empre&s;s-Queen could not
help remon&s;trating again&s;t this demand as exorbitant in
it&s;elf, and the more unrea&s;onable, as the Elector Palatine,
at the death of her father, had openly declared again&s;t the
pragmatick &s;anction, which he had guaranteed in the mo&s;t
&s;olemn manner: &s;he, therefore, ob&s;erved that the damage
he had &s;u&s;tained, in con&s;equence of that declaration, ought
to be con&s;idered as the common fate of war. The&s;e rea|&s;ons,
though conclu&s;ive and irrefragable in the u&s;ual way
of arguing, made no impre&s;&s;ion upon the Palatine, who
perfectly well under&s;tood his own importance, and was de|termined
to &s;ei&s;e this opportunity of turning it to the be&s;t
advantage. The court of Vienna, and the Maritime
Powers, finding him thus ob&s;tinately attached to his own
intere&s;t, re&s;olved to bring him over to their views at any
rate, and commenced a negociation with him, which pro|duced
a formal treaty. By this convention his demands
in money were fixed at twelve hundred thou&s;and Dutch
&s;torms, to be paid at three in&s;talments, five hundred thou|&s;and
by the Empre&s;s-Queen, and the remaining &s;even
hundred thou&s;and by the King of Great-Britain and the
States-General, according to the proportion e&s;tabli&s;hed in
<PB N="315" REF="323">
former treaties. The privilege of <HI>Non appellendo,</HI> for the
duchy of Deux-ponts, was confirmed to his electoral
highne&s;s, together with &s;ome other rights and preten&s;ions,
in con&s;ideration of his concurring with the other electors
in the choice of a king of the Romans, to be elected ac|cording
to the cu&s;toms pre&s;cribed by the laws and con&s;ti|tutions
of the Empire. He likewi&s;e engaged to join them
in &s;ettling the articles of the capitulation with the King of
the Romans, emperor <HI>in futuro.</HI> Yet, even after the
concurrence of this prince was &s;ecured, the purpo&s;ed
election proved abortive, from the &s;trong objections that
were &s;tarted, and the &s;trenuous oppo&s;ition which was made
by his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who perhaps a&s;pired in &s;ecret at
the Imperial dignity, which the Empre&s;s-Queen took all
this pains to perpetuate in her own family.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1753.</NOTE> The King of Great-Britain, returning from
the continent, opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament on the
eleventh day of January with a &s;peech, implying, That
all his views and negociations had been calculated and di|rected
to pre&s;erve and &s;ecure the duration of the general
peace, &s;o agreeable and nece&s;&s;ary to the welfare of all
Europe: That he had the &s;atisfaction to be a&s;&s;ured of a
good di&s;po&s;ition in all the powers that were his allies, to
adhere to the &s;ame &s;alutary object. He exhorted them to
continue their attention to the reduction of the national
debt, the augmentation of the &s;inking fund, and the im|provement
of the publick revenue. He recommended
to their &s;erious con&s;ideration what further laws and regu|lations
might be nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e crimes and
di&s;orders, of which the publick had &s;o ju&s;tly complained:
and concluded with an a&s;&s;urance, that his hearty con|currence
and endeavours &s;hould never be wanting in any
mea&s;ure that might promote their welfare and pro&s;perity.
The addre&s;&s;es in an&s;wer to this &s;peech were couched in
the u&s;ual form of implicit approbation: but that of the
Commons did not pa&s;s without que&s;tion. The Earl of
E&mdash;took exceptions to one paragraph, in which they
acknowledged his Maje&s;ty's wi&s;dom, as well as goodne&s;s,
<PB N="316" REF="324">
in pur&s;uing &s;uch mea&s;ures as mu&s;t contribute to maintain and
render permanent the general tranquillity of Europe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1753.</NOTE> and
declared their &s;atisfaction at the a&s;&s;urances his Maje&s;ty had
received from his allies, that they were all attached to the
&s;ame &s;alutary object. His lord&s;hip expatiated on the ab|&s;urdity
of the&s;e compliments at &s;uch a juncture, when the
peace of Europe was &s;o precarious, and the Engli&s;h nation
had &s;o much cau&s;e of complaint and di&s;&s;atisfaction. He
was &s;econded by &s;ome other individuals, who declaimed
with great vivacity again&s;t continental connexions; and
endeavoured to expo&s;e the weakne&s;s and folly of the whole
&s;y&s;tem of foreign mea&s;ures which our mini&s;try had lately
pur&s;ued. It mu&s;t be owned, indeed, that they might
have cho&s;en a better opportunity to compliment their
&s;overeign on the permanency of the peace than at this
juncture, when they mu&s;t have &s;een them&s;elves on the very
brink of a new rupture with the mo&s;t formidable power in
Europe. But the truth is, the&s;e addre&s;&s;es to the throne
had been long con&s;idered as compliments of cour&s;e, im|plying
no more than a re&s;pectful attachment to their
&s;overeign: accordingly, both Hou&s;es agreed to their re|&s;pective
addre&s;&s;es without divi&s;ion. The two grand com|mittees
of &s;upply and of ways and means being e&s;tabli&s;hed,
the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e was tran&s;acted without much
altercation; and the people had great rea&s;on to be &s;atisfi|ed
with their moderate proceedings. Ten thou&s;and &s;ea|men,
and the u&s;ual number of land-forces, were retained
for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year. They provided for
the maintenance of the new colony in Nova-Scotia, the
civil e&s;tabli&s;hment of Georgia, the &s;upport of the ca&s;tles
on the coa&s;t of Guinea, and the erection of a new fort
at Anamaboa, where the French had attempted to make
a &s;ettlement; and they enabled his Maje&s;ty to fulfil his
engagements with the King of Poland and the Elector
of Bavaria.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. The &s;upplies, including grants for former de|ficiencies
and &s;ervices, for which no provi&s;ion had been
made in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year, did not exceed two
<PB N="317" REF="325">
millions one hundred thirty-two thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and &s;even pounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1753.</NOTE> &s;eventeen &s;hillings, and two-pence
half-penny; in order to defray which expen&s;e they a&s;&s;ign|ed
the duty on malt, &amp;c. the land-tax at two &s;hillings in
the pound, the &s;urplus of certain funds in the Exchequer,
and the &s;um of four hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds
out of the &s;inking fund; &s;o that the exceedings amounted
to near three hundred thou&s;and pounds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Several duties on &s;alt, as well as on red and white herrings delivered out for home con&s;umption, were rendered perpetual, though &s;ubject to be redeemed by parliament; and it was provided, that the debt contracted upon the&s;e duties being di&s;charged, all the after produce of them &s;hould become part of the &s;inking fund.</NOTE>. As for the
national debt, it now &s;tood at the enormous &s;um of &s;even|ty-four
millions three hundred &s;ixty-eight thou&s;and four
hundred and fifty-one pounds, fifteen &s;hillings, and one
penny; and the &s;inking fund produced one million &s;even
hundred thirty-five thou&s;and five hundred and twenty-nine
pounds, &s;ix &s;hillings, and ten-pence farthing.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. One of the fir&s;t mea&s;ures brought upon the
carpet, in the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, was an act containing
regulations for the better pre&s;ervation of the game, of
which &s;o great havock had been made by poachers, and
other per&s;ons unqualified to enjoy that diver&s;ion, that the
total extirpation of it was apprehended.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The next &s;tep taken by the Commons was an
affair of much greater con&s;equence to the community,
being a bill for obliging &s;hips the more effectually to per|form
quarantine, in order to prevent the plague from
being imported from foreign countries into Great-Britain.
For this purpo&s;e, it was ordained, that if this dreadful
vi&s;itation &s;hould appear in any &s;hip to the northward of
Cape Fini&s;terre, the ma&s;ter or commander &s;hould imme|diately
proceed to the harbour of New Grim&s;by, in one of
the i&s;lands o$ Scilly, and there communicate the di&s;covery

at the &s;aid i&s;land, and not an individual pre&s;ume to
go a&s;hore, until his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure &s;hould be known
It was al&s;o provided, that in ca&s;e the ma&s;ter of a &s;hip
thus infected &s;hould not be able to make the i&s;lands of
Scilly, or be forced up either channel by violent winds
he &s;hould not enter any frequented harbour; but remain$
in &s;ome open road, until he could receive orders from his$
Maje&s;ty, or the privy-council: that, during this interval&punc;
he &s;hould avoid all intercour&s;e with the &s;hore, or any
per&s;on or ve&s;&s;el what&s;oever, on pain of being deemed guil|ty
of felony, and &s;uffering death without benefit of clergy.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. In order the more effectually to repre&s;s the
barbarous practice of plundering &s;hips which have the
misfortune to &s;uffer &s;hipwreck; a practice which prevaile$
upon many different parts of the Briti&s;h coa&s;t, to the di&s;|grace
of the nation, and the &s;candal of human nature; $
bill was prepared, containing clau&s;es to enforce the law$
again&s;t &s;uch &s;avage delinquents, who prowl along
the &s;hore, like hungry wolves, in hopes of preying upon
their fellow-creatures; and certain provi&s;ions for the re|lief
of the unhappy &s;ufferers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By this new law, the clerk of the peace in the county where the crim &s;hall be committed is obliged, upon receiving proper information, to pro|&s;ecute the offenders at the expen&s;e of the country. It was likewi&s;e propo&s;ed that in ca&s;e no pro&s;ecution of this nature &s;hould be commenced within&punc; certain limited time after the information &s;hould have been legally given, in that ca&s;e the county might be &s;ued by the per&s;on who had &s;u&s;tained the damage, and obliged to indemnify him for his lo&s;s: but this clau&s;e was rejected by the majority; and the bill, having made its way through both Hou&s;es, received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</NOTE>. When the mutiny-bil$
fell under deliberation, the Earl of Egmont propo&s;e$
a new clau&s;e for empowering and requiring regimenta$
courts-martial to examine witne&s;&s;es upon oath in al$
their trials. The propo&s;al occa&s;ioned a debate, in whic$
the mini&s;try were pretty equally divided; but the clau$$
was di&s;approved by the majority, and this annual bill wa$
enacted into a law without any alteration.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="327">
&sect; XXIII. The next bill was framed in con&s;equence of
divers petitions pre&s;ented by the exporters of corn, who
complained that the bounties were not paid, and prayed
that the Hou&s;e would make proper provi&s;ion for that pur|po&s;e.
A bill was accordingly brought in, importing,
That intere&s;t after the rate of three per cent. &s;hould be
allowed upon every debenture for the bounty on the ex|portation
of corn, payable by the receiver-general or ca|&s;$ier
of the Cu&s;toms, until the principal could be di&s;charged
out of &s;uch Cu&s;toms or duties as are appropriated for the
payment of this bounty. This premium on the exportation
of corn ought not to be granted, except when the lowne&s;s
of the market-price in Great-Britain proves that there is a
&s;uperabundance in the kingdom; otherwi&s;e the exporter
will find his account in depriving our own labourers of
their bread, in order to &s;upply our rivals at an ea&s;ier rate:
for example, &s;uppo&s;e wheat in England &s;hould &s;ell for
twenty &s;hillings a quarter, the merchant might export it to
France, and afford it to the people of that kingdom for
eighteen &s;hillings, becau&s;e the bounty on exportation
would, even at that rate, afford him a con&s;iderable ad|vantage.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. A great number of merchants having pre&s;ent|ed
petitions from different parts of the kingdom, repre&s;ent|ing
that the trade to Turkey was greatly decrea&s;ed, a&s;crib|ing
this diminution to the exclu&s;ive charter enjoyed by a
monopoly, and praying that the trade might be laid open
to all his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, one of the members for Liver|pool
moved for leave to bring in a bill for this purpo&s;e.
Such a mea&s;ure had been twice before propo&s;ed without
&s;ucce&s;s; but now it was adopted without oppo&s;ition. A
bill was immediately introduced; and, notwith&s;tanding all
the intere&s;t and efforts of the Turkey company, who pe|titioned
the Hou&s;e again&s;t it, and were heard by their coun|&s;el,
it pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es, and received the royal
&s;anction. By this regulation any Briti&s;h &s;ubject may ob|tain
the freedom of the Turkey company, by paying or
tendering a fine of twenty pounds; and all the members
<PB N="320" REF="328">
are &s;ecured from the tyranny of oppre&s;&s;ive by-laws, con|trived
by any monopolizing cabal<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Several other bills were pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;one for regulating the number of public-hou&s;es, and the more ea&s;y conviction of per&s;ons &s;elling ale and &s;trong li|quors without licen&s;e; an act which empowered the ju&s;tices of peace to tyranni&s;e over their fellow &s;ubjects&mdash;a &s;econd, enabling the magi&s;trates of Edinburgh to improve, enlarge, and adorn the avenues and &s;treets of that city, according to a concerted plan, to be executed by voluntary &s;ub&s;crip|tion&mdash;a third, allowing the exportation of wool and woollen yarn from Ireland into any port in Great Britain&mdash;and a fourth, pre&s;cribing the breadth of the wheels belonging to heavy carriages, that the high roads of th$ kingdom might be the bette$ p$e&s;erved.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. But this &s;e&s;&s;ion was chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed by
an act for naturalizing Jews, and a bill for the better pre|venting
clande&s;tine marriages. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, which
pa&s;&s;ed without much oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Lords,
from whence it de&s;cended to the Commons, was intituled,
&startq;An Act to permit Per&s;ons profe&s;&s;ing the Jewi&s;h Religion
to be naturalized by Parliament, and for other Purpo&s;es
therein mentioned.&endq; It was &s;upported by &s;ome petitions
of merchants and manufacturers, who, upon examination,
appeared to be Jews, or their dependants; and counte|nanced
by the mini&s;try, who thought they fore&s;aw, in the
con&s;equences of &s;uch a naturalization, a great acce&s;&s;ion to
the moneyed intere&s;t, and a con&s;iderable increa&s;e of their
own influence among the individuals of that community.
They boldly affirmed, that &s;uch a law would greatly con|duce
to the advantage of the nation; that it would
encourage per&s;ons of wealth to remove with their ef|fects
from foreign parts into Great-Britain, increa&s;e the
commerce and the credit of the kingdom, and &s;et a lauda|ble
example of indu&s;try, temperance, and frugality. Such,
however, were not the &s;entiments of the Lord-Mayor,
aldermen, and commons of the city of London in common-council
a&s;&s;embled, who, in a petition to parliament, ex|pre&s;&s;ed
their apprehen&s;ion that the bill, if pa&s;&s;ed into a law,
would tend greatly to the di&s;honour of the chri&s;tian religion,
endanger the excellent con&s;titution, and be highly preju|dicial
to the intere&s;t and trade of the kingdom in general,
and of the city of London in particular. Another petition
<PB N="321" REF="329">
to the &s;ame purpo&s;e was next day pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e,
&s;ub&s;cribed by merchants and traders of the city of London;
who, among other allegations, ob&s;erved, that the con&s;e|quences
of &s;uch a naturalization would greatly affect their
trade and commerce with foreign nations, particularly
with Spain and Portugal. Coun&s;el was heard, evidence
examined, and the bill produced violent debates, in which
there &s;eemed to be more pa&s;&s;ion than patrioti&s;m, more de|clamation
than argument. The adver&s;aries of the bill af|firmed,
that &s;uch a naturalization would deluge the king|dom
with brokers, u&s;urers, and beggars; that the rich Jews,
under the &s;hadow of this indulgence, would purcha&s;e lands,
and even advow&s;ons; &s;o as not only to acquire an intere&s;t
in the legi&s;lature, but al&s;o to influence the con&s;titution of
the church of Chri&s;t, to which they were the inveterate and
profe&s;&s;ed enemies: that the lower cla&s;s of that nation,
when thus admitted to the right of denizens, would inter|fere
with the indu&s;trious natives who earn their livelihood
by their labour; and by dint of the mo&s;t par&s;imonious fru|gality,
to which the Engli&s;h are &s;trangers, work at an
under-price; &s;o as not only to &s;hare, but even in a man|ner
to exclude them from all employment: that &s;uch an
adoption of vagrant Jews into the community, from all
parts of the world, would rob the real &s;ubjects of their
birthright, di&s;grace the character of the nation, expo&s;e
them&s;elves to the mo&s;t di&s;honourable participation and in|tru&s;ion,
endanger the con&s;titution both in church and &s;tate,
and be an indelible reproach upon the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion
of the country. Some of the&s;e orators &s;eemed tran&s;ported
even to a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m. They progno&s;ticated that
the Jews would multiply &s;o much in number, engro&s;s
&s;uch wealth, and acquire &s;o great power and influence in
Great-Britain, that their per&s;ons would be revered, their
cu&s;toms imitated, and Judai&s;m become the fa&s;hionable re|ligion
of the Engli&s;h. Finally, they affirmed that &s;uch an act
was directly flying in the face of the prophe&s;y, which de|clares,
that the Jews &s;hall be a &s;cattered people, without coun|try
or fixed habitation, until they &s;hall be converted from their
<PB N="322" REF="330">
infidelity, and gathered together in the land of their fore|fathers.
The&s;e arguments and apprehen&s;ions, which were
in reality frivolous and chimerical, being indu&s;triou&s;ly cir|culated
among the vulgar, naturally prejudiced again&s;t the
Jewi&s;h people, excited &s;uch a ferment throughout the na|tion,
as ought to have deterred the mini&s;ter from the pro&s;e|cution
of &s;uch an unpopular mea&s;ure; which, however,
they had courage enough to maintain again&s;t all oppo&s;ition.
The bill pa&s;&s;ed the ordeal of both Hou&s;es, and his Maje&s;ty
vouch&s;afed the royal &s;anction to this law in favour of the
Hebrew nation. The truth is, it might have increa&s;ed the
wealth, and extended the commerce of Great-Britain, had
it been agreeable to the people; and as the naturalized
Jews would &s;till have been excluded from all civil and
military offices, as well as from other privileges enjoyed
by their Chri&s;tian brethren, in all probability they would
have gradually for&s;aken their own unprofitable and ob&s;ti|nate
infidelity, opened their eyes to the &s;hining truths of
the go&s;pel, and joined their fellow-&s;ubjects in embracing
the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity. But no mini&s;try ought to
ri&s;k an experiment, how plau&s;ible &s;oever it may be, if they
find it, as this was, an object of the people's unconquerable
aver&s;ion. What rendered this unpopular mea&s;ure the
more impolitick, was the un&s;ea&s;onable juncture at which
it was carried into execution; that is, at the eve of a ge|neral
election for a new parliament, when a mini&s;ter ought
carefully to avoid every &s;tep which may give umbrage to
the body of the people. The Earl of Eg&mdash;t, who ar|gued
again&s;t the bill with equal power and vivacity, in de|&s;cribing
the effect it might have upon that occa&s;ion, &startq;I
am amazed (&s;aid he) that this con&s;ideration makes no
impre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;When that day, which is not far off, &s;hall
arrive, I &s;hall not fear to &s;et my foot upon any ground
of election in the kingdom, in oppo&s;ition to any one man
among you, or any new Chri&s;tian, who has voted or ap|peared
in &s;avour of this naturalization.&endq;</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. Another bill, tran&s;mitted from the Upper
Hou&s;e, met with a reception equally unfavourable among
<PB N="323" REF="331">
the Commons, though it was &s;u&s;tained on the &s;houlders of
the majority, and thus forced its way to the throne, where
it obtained the royal approbation. The practice of &s;olemn|i&s;ing
clande&s;tine marriages, &s;o prejudicial to the peace of
families, and &s;o often productive of mi&s;ery to the parties
them&s;elves thus united, was an evil that prevailed to &s;uch
a degree as claimed the attention of the legi&s;lature. The
&s;ons and daughters of great and opulent families, before
they had acquired knowledge and experience, or attained
to the years of di&s;cretion, were every day &s;educed in their
affections, and inveigled into matches big with infamy
and ruin; and the&s;e were greatly facilitated by the oppor|tunities
that occurred of being united in&s;tantaneou&s;ly by
the ceremony of marriage, in the fir&s;t tran&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion,
before the de&s;tined victim had time to cool or deliberate on
the &s;ubject. For this pernicious purpo&s;e, there was a band of
profligate mi&s;creants, the refu&s;e of the clergy, dead to every
&s;entiment of virtue, abandoned to all &s;en&s;e of decency and
decorum, for the mo&s;t part pri&s;oners for debt or delinquen|cy,
and indeed the very outca&s;ts of human &s;ociety, who
hovered about the verge of the Fleet-pri&s;on to intercept cu&s;|tomers,
plying like porters for employment, and performed
the ceremony of marriage without licen&s;e or que&s;tion, in
cellars, garrets, or alehou&s;es, to the &s;candal of religion, and
the di&s;grace of that order which they profe&s;&s;ed. The ea&s;e
with which this eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;anction was obtained, and
the vicious di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e wretches, open to the
practices of fraud and corruption, were productive of po|lygamy,
indigence, conjugal infidelity, pro&s;titution, and
every cur&s;e that could embitter the married &s;tate. A re|markable
ca&s;e of this nature having fallen under the cogni|zance
of the Peers, in an appeal from an inferior tribunal,
that Hou&s;e ordered the judges to prepare a new bill for pre|venting
&s;uch abu&s;es; and one was accordingly framed,
under the au&s;pices of Lord Hardwicke, at that time lord high
chancellor of England. In order to anticipate the bad
effects of clande&s;tine marriages, this new &s;tatute enacted,
That the banns &s;hould be regularly publi&s;hed, three &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
<PB N="324" REF="332">
Sundays, in the church of the pari&s;h where the par|ties
dwell: That no licen&s;e &s;hould be granted to marry in
any place, where one of the parties has not dwelt at lea&s;t a
month, except a &s;pecial licen&s;e by the Archbi&s;hop: That
if any marriage &s;hould be &s;olemni&s;ed in any other place
than a church or a chapel, without a &s;pecial licen&s;e, or
in a publick chapel, without having publi&s;hed the banns, or
obtained a licen&s;e of &s;ome per&s;on properly qualified, the
marriage &s;hould be void, and the per&s;on who &s;olemni&s;ed it
tran&s;ported for &s;even years: That marriages, by licen&s;e, by
parties under age, without con&s;ent of parent or guardian,
&s;hould be null and void, unle&s;s the party under age be a
widow, and the parent refu&s;ing con&s;ent a widow married
again: That when the con&s;ent of a mother or guardian is
refu&s;ed from caprice, or &s;uch parent or guardian be <HI>non
compos mentis,</HI> or beyond $ea, the minor &s;hould have recour&s;e
for relief to the court of Chancery: That no &s;uit &s;hould
be commenced to compel a celebration of marriages, upon
pretence of any contract: That all marriages &s;hould be
&s;olemni&s;ed before two witne&s;&s;es, and an entry be made in
a book kept for that purpo&s;e, whether it was by banns or
licen&s;e, whether either of the parties was under age, or the
marriage celebrated with the con&s;ent of parent or guardian;
and this entry to be &s;igned by the mini&s;ter, the parties,
and the witne&s;&s;es: That a fal&s;e licen&s;e or certificate, or de|&s;troying
regi&s;ter books, &s;hould be deemed felony, either in
principal or acce&s;&s;ary, and puni&s;hed with death. The bill
when fir&s;t con&s;idered in the Lower Hou&s;e, gave ri&s;e to a
variety of debates; in which the members appeared to be
divided rather according to their real &s;entiments, than by
the rules of any political di$tinction: for &s;ome principal
&s;ervants of the government freely differed in opinion from
the mini&s;ter, who countenanced the bill; while, on the
other hand, he was, on this occa&s;ion, &s;upported by certain
chiefs of the oppo&s;ition, and the di&s;putes were maintained
with extraordinary eagerne&s;s and warmth. The princi|pal
objections imported, that &s;uch re&s;trictions on marriage
would damp the &s;pirit of love and propagation; promote
<PB N="325" REF="333">
mercenary matches, to the ruin of dome&s;tick happine&s;s, as
well as to the prejudice of po&s;terity and population; im|pede
the circulation of property, by pre&s;erving the wealth
of the kingdom among a kind of ari&s;tocracy of opulent
families, who would always intermarry within their own
pale; &s;ubject the poor to many inconveniencies, and extra|ordinary
expen&s;e, from the nature of the forms to be ob|&s;erved;
and throw an additional power into the hands of
the chancellor. They affirmed, that no human power
had a right to di&s;&s;olve a vow &s;olemnly made in the &s;ight of
heaven: and that, in proportion as the bill prevented
clande&s;tine marriages, it would encourage fornication and
debau$hery, ina&s;much as the parties, re&s;trained from in|dulging
their mutual pa&s;&s;ions in an honourable manner,
would be tempted to gratify them by &s;tealth, at the ha|zard
of their reputation. In a word they fore&s;aw a great
number of evils in the train of this bill, which have not
yet been reali&s;ed. On the other &s;ide, its advocates en|deavoured
to refute the&s;e arguments, and &s;ome of them
&s;poke with great &s;trength and preci&s;ion. The bill under|went
a great number of alterations and amendments, which
were not effected without violent conte&s;t and altercation.
At length, however, it was floated through both Hou&s;es
on the tide of a great majority, and &s;teered into the &s;afe
harbour of royal approbation. Certain it is, the abu&s;e of
clande&s;tine marriage might have been removed upon much
ea&s;ier terms than tho&s;e impo&s;ed upon the &s;ubject by this
bill, which, after all, hath been found ineffectual, as it may
be ea&s;ily eluded by a &s;hort voyage to the continent, or a
moderate journey to North-Britain, where the indi&s;&s;oluble
knot may be tied without &s;cruple or interruption.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. Over and above the&s;e new &s;tatutes there were
&s;ome other &s;ubjects which occa&s;ionally employed the at|tention
of the Commons; &s;uch as the &s;tate of the Briti&s;h
&s;ugar colonies, which was con&s;idered, in con&s;equence of
petitions pre&s;ented by the &s;ugar-refiners and grocers of
London, We&s;tmin&s;ter, and Bri&s;tol, complaining of the
exorbitant price demanded and given for &s;ugars imported
<PB N="326" REF="334">
from Jamaica; de&s;iring that the proprietors of land in
Jamaica might be obliged to cultivate greater quantities of
ground for rai&s;ing &s;ugar canes, or that they (the petitioners)
might have leave to import mu&s;covado &s;ugars from other
countries, when the price of tho&s;e imported from Jamaica
&s;hould exceed a certain rate. This remon&s;trance was
taken into con&s;ideration by a committee of the whole
Hou&s;e; and a great number of evidences and papers being
examined, they re&s;olved, That the peopling of Jamaica
with white inhabitants, and cultivating the lands thereof,
would be the mo&s;t proper mea&s;ure for &s;ecuring that i&s;land,
and increa&s;ing the trade and navigation between it and
Great-Britain, and other parts of his Maje&s;ty's dominions:
That the endeavours hitherto u&s;ed by the legi&s;lature of Ja|maica
to increa&s;e the number of white inhabitants, and en|force
the cultivation of lands, in the manner that might
be&s;t conduce to the &s;ecurity and defence of that i&s;land, had
not been effectual for the&s;e purpo&s;es. The Hou&s;e ordered
a bill to be founded on the&s;e re&s;olutions; but this was
po&s;tponed, until the mini&s;try &s;hould receive more full in|formation
touching the true &s;tate of that i&s;land. The
planters of Jamaica laboured under many grievances and
hard&s;hips, from divers heavy impo&s;itions and re&s;trictions;
and a detail of the&s;e was tran&s;mitted in a repre&s;entation to
his Maje&s;ty, which was referred to the con&s;ideration of the
commi&s;&s;ioners of trade and plantations. The cau&s;e of the
planters was defended vigorou&s;ly, and managed in the
Hou&s;e of Commons by Alderman Beckford, a gentleman
of va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the i&s;land of Jamaica, who perfectly
well under&s;tood, and &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upported, the intere&s;t o$
that his native country.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. Abortive al&s;o proved the attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h
a law, for keeping an annual regi&s;ter of marriages, births,
deaths, the individuals who received alms, and the total
number of people in Great-Britain. A bill for this pur|po&s;e
was pre&s;ented by Mr. Potter, a gentleman of pregnant
parts and &s;pirited elocution, who, enumerating the advan|tages
of &s;uch a law, ob&s;erved, that it would a&s;certain the
<PB N="327" REF="335">
number of the people, and the collective &s;trength of the
nation; con&s;equently point out tho&s;e places where there is
a defect or exce&s;s of population, and certainly determine
whether a general naturalization would be advantageous
or prejudicial to the community; that it would decide what
number of men might, on any &s;udden emergency, be le|vied
for the defence of the kingdom; and whether the na|tion
is gainer or lo&s;er by &s;ending its natives to &s;ettle, and
our troops to defend di&s;tant colonies; that it would be the
means of e&s;tabli&s;hing a local admini&s;tration of civil govern|ment,
or a police upon certain fixed principles, the want
of which hath been long a reproach to the nation, a &s;ecuri|ty
to vice, and an encouragement to idlene&s;s; that in ma|ny
ca&s;es, where all other evidence is wanting, it would
enable &s;uitors to recover their right in courts of ju&s;tice, fa|cilitate
an equal and equitable a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment in rai&s;ing the
pre&s;ent taxes, and laying future impo&s;itions; &s;pecify the
lineal de&s;cents, relations, and alliances of families; lighten
the intolerable burthens incurred by the publick, from in|numerable
and ab&s;urd regulations relating to the poor;
provide for them by a more equal exertion of humanity,
and effectually &s;creen them from all ri&s;que of peri&s;hing by
hunger, cold, cruelty, and oppre&s;&s;ion. Whether &s;uch a
law would have an&s;wered the &s;anguine expectations of its
patron, we &s;hall not pretend to determine; though, in our
opinion, it mu&s;t have been attended with very &s;alutary con|&s;equences,
particularly in re&s;training the hand of robbery
and violence, in detecting fraud, bridling the ferocity of a
licentious people, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a happy &s;y&s;tem of order
and &s;ubordination. At fir&s;t the bill met with little oppo|&s;ition,
except from Mr. Thornton, member for the city of
York, who inveighed again&s;t it with great fervour, as a
mea&s;ure that favoured of French policy, to which the Eng|li&s;h
nation ever had the utmo&s;t aver&s;ion. He affirmed,
that the method in which it was propo&s;ed this regi&s;ter
&s;hould be kept would furni&s;h the enemies of Great-Britain
with continual opportunities of knowing the &s;trength or
weakne&s;s of the nation; that it would empower an ill-de|&s;igning
<PB N="328" REF="336">
mini&s;ter to execute any &s;cheme &s;ubver&s;ive of pub|lick
liberty, inve&s;t pari&s;h and petty officers of the peace with
exorbitant powers, and co&s;t the nation above fifty thou&s;and
pounds a-year to carry the &s;cheme into execution. The&s;e
arguments, which, we apprehend, are extremely frivolous
and inconclu&s;ive, had great weight with a con&s;iderable
number, who joined in the oppo&s;ition, while the mini&s;try
&s;tood neutral. Neverthele&s;s, after having undergone &s;ome
amendments, it was conveyed to the Lords, by whom it
was, at the &s;econd reading, thrown out, as a &s;cheme of a
very dangerous tendency. The legi&s;lature of Great-Britain
have, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, been more &s;tartled at the di&s;tant
&s;hadow of a bare po&s;&s;ibility, than at the real approach of
the mo&s;t dangerous innovation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. From the u&s;ual deliberations on civil and
commercial concerns, the attention of the parliament,
which had &s;eldom or never turned upon literary avocations,
was called off by an extraordinary &s;ubject of this nature.
Sir Hans Sloane, the celebrated phy&s;ician and naturali&s;t,
well known through all the civili&s;ed countries of Europe
for his ample collection of rarities, culled from the animal,
vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, as well as of antiquities
and curio&s;ities of art, had directed, in his la&s;t will, that
this valuable mu&s;eum, together with his numerous library,
&s;hould be offered to the parliament, for the u&s;e of the pub|lick,
in con&s;ideration of their paying a certain &s;um, in com|pen&s;ation,
to his heirs. His terms were embraced by the
Commons, who agreed to pay twenty thou&s;and pounds for
the whole, &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth four times that &s;um; and
a bill was prepared for purcha&s;ing this mu&s;eum, together
with the Harleian collection of manu&s;cripts, &s;o denominated
from its founder, Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, lord
high trea&s;urer of England, and now offered to the pub|lick
by his daughter, the Duche&s;s of Portland. It was
propo&s;ed, that the&s;e purcha&s;es &s;hould be joined to the $a|mous
Cottonian library, and a &s;uitable repo&s;itory provided
for them and the king's library, which had long lain ne|glected,
and expo&s;ed to the injuries of the weather in the
<PB N="329" REF="337">
old dormitory at We&s;tmin&s;ter. Accordingly, tru&s;tees and
governors, con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t eminent per&s;ons of the
kingdom, were appointed, and regulations e&s;tabli&s;hed for
the management of this noble mu&s;eum, which was de|po&s;ited
in Montagu-Hou&s;e, one of the mo&s;t magnifi|cent
edifices in England, where it is &s;ubjected without
re&s;erve to the view of the publick, under certain nece&s;|&s;ary
re&s;trictions, and exhibits a glorious monument of
national ta&s;te and liberality.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The library of Sir Hans Sloane con&s;i&s;ted of above fifty thou&s;and volumes, $word$-luding about three hundred and fifty books of drawings, and three thou&s;and five hundred and &s;ixteen manu&s;cripts, be&s;ides a multitude of prints. The mu&s;eum comprehended an infinite number of medals, coins, $rns, $word$, &s;eals, cam$os, intaglios, precious &s;tones ve&s;&s;els of agate and ja&s;per, chry&s;ts, &s;pars, fo&s;&s;ile, metals, minerals, ores, earths, &s;ands, &s;alts, bitumens, &s;ulphur amber, ambergri&s;e, tal$s, mirae, te&s;tacea, cor$ls, &s;ponges, echini, echenite$ a$teriae, trochi, cru&s;tatia, &s;t$llae marinae, fi&s;hes, birds, eggs, and ne&s;ts, vips, &s;erpents, quadrupeds, in&s;ects, human calculi, anatomical pre|parations, $ds, gums, roots, dried plants, pictures, drawings, and mathe|matical in&s;t$$ments. All the&s;e articles, with a &s;hort account of each, are &s;pecified in $word$-eight volumes in folio, and eight in quarto.</NOTE>. In the beginning of June
the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was clo&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty, who
mentioned nothing particular in his &s;peech, but that the
&s;tate of foreign affairs had &s;uffered no alteration &s;ince their
meeting.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The genius of the Engli&s;h people is perhaps
incompatible with a &s;tate of perfect tranquillity: if it is
not ruffled by foreign provocations, or agitated by unpo|pular
mea&s;ures of dome&s;tick admini&s;tration, it will
undergo temporary fermentations from the turbulent in|gredients
inherent in its own con&s;titution. Tumults are
excited, and factions kindled into rage and inveteracy,
by incidents of the mo&s;t frivolous nature. At this junc|ture
the metropolis of England was divided and di&s;com|po&s;ed
in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner, by a di&s;pute in it&s;elf of &s;o
little con&s;equence to the community, that it could not
de&s;erve a place in a general hi&s;tory, if it did not &s;erve to
convey a characteri&s;tick idea of the Engli&s;h nation. In
the beginning of the year an ob&s;cure dam&s;el, of low
degree, who&s;e name was Eli&s;abeth Canning, promulgated
a report, which in a little time attracted the attention
<PB N="330" REF="338">
of the publick. She affirmed, that on the fir&s;t day of
the new year, at night, &s;he was &s;ei&s;ed under Bedlam|wall
by two ruffians, who having &s;tripped her of her up|per
apparel, &s;ecured her mouth with a gag, and threatened
to murther her &s;hould &s;he make the lea&s;t noi&s;e; that they
conveyed her on foot about ten miles, to a place called
Endfield-wa&s;h, and brought her to the hou&s;e of one Mrs.
Wells, where &s;he was pillaged of her &s;tays; and, becau&s;e
&s;he refu&s;ed to turn pro&s;titute, confined in a cold, damp,
&s;eparate, and unfurni&s;hed apartment; where &s;he remain|ed
a whole month, without any other &s;u&s;tenance than
a few &s;tale cru&s;ts of bread, and about a gallon of water;
till at length &s;he forced her way through a window, and
ran home to her mother's hou&s;e, almo&s;t naked, in the
night of the twenty-ninth of January. This &s;tory, im|probable
and un&s;upported, operated &s;o &s;trongly on the
pa&s;&s;ions of the people in the neighbourhood of Alderman|bury,
where Canning's mother lived, and particularly
among fanaticks of all denominations, that they rai&s;e$
voluntary contributions, with &s;urpri&s;ing eagerne&s;s, i$
order to bring the &s;uppo&s;ed delinquents to ju&s;tice. War|rants
were granted for apprehending Wells, who kep$
the hou&s;e at Endfield-wa&s;h, and her accomplices, th$
&s;ervant-maid, who&s;e name was Virtue Hall, and on$
Squires, an old gip&s;ey-woman, which la&s;t was charge$
by Canning with having robbed her of her &s;tays. Wells
though acquitted of the felony, was puni&s;hed as a baw$
Hall turned evidence for Canning, but afterwards re$|canted.
Squires, the gip&s;ey, was convicted of the rob$bery,
though &s;he produced undoubted evidence to prove
that &s;he was at Abbot&s;bury in Dor&s;et&s;hire that very nig$$
in which the felony was &s;aid to be committed, and Can|$ning
and her friends fell into divers contradictions dur$ng
the cour&s;e of the trial. By this time the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;i$$ o$
the common people in her favour had ri&s;en to $word$ a$
pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;m, that the mo&s;t palpable truth$ which
appeared on the other &s;ide had no other effect $word$ that $word$
of exa&s;perating them to the mo&s;t dangerous $egree of
rage and revenge. Some of the witne&s;&s;es $word$ Squires,
<PB N="331" REF="339">
though per&s;ons of unblemi&s;hed character, were &s;o inti|midated
that they dur&s;t not enter the court; and tho&s;e
who had re&s;olution enough to give evidence in her behalf,
ran the ri&s;que of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination from the vulgar that &s;ur|rounded
the place. On this occa&s;ion, Sir Cri&s;p Ga&s;|coyne,
lord-mayor of London, behaved with that laud|able
courage and humanity which ought ever to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the chief magi&s;trate of &s;uch a metropolis. Con&s;i|dering
the improbability of the charge, the heat, par|tiality,
and blind enthu&s;ia&s;m with which it was pro&s;ecuted,
and being convinced of the old woman's innocence by a
great number of affidavits, voluntarily &s;ent up from the
country by per&s;ons of unque&s;tionable credit, he, in con|junction
with &s;ome other worthy citizens, re&s;olved to
oppo&s;e the torrent of vulgar prejudice. Application was
made to the throne for mercy: the ca&s;e was referred to
the Attorney and Sollicitor-General, who, having exa|mined
the evidences on both &s;ides, made their report in
favour of Squires to the King and council; and this poor
old creature was indulged with his Maje&s;ty's pardon.
This affair was now &s;welled up into &s;uch a faction as
divided the greater part of the kingdom, including the
rich as well as the poor, the high as well as the humble.
Pamphlets and pa&s;quinades were publi&s;hed on both &s;ides
of the di&s;pute, which became the general topick of con|ver&s;ation
in all a&s;&s;emblies, and people of all ranks e&s;pou&s;ed
one or other party with as much warmth and animo&s;ity
as had ever inflamed the Whigs and Tories, even at the
mo&s;t rancorous period of their oppo&s;ition. Sub&s;criptions
were opened, and large &s;ums levied, on one &s;ide, to pro|&s;ecute
for perjury the per&s;ons on who&s;e evidence the par|don
had been granted. On the other hand, tho&s;e who
had $tere&s;ted them&s;elves for the gip&s;ey re&s;olved to &s;up|port
$word$ witne&s;&s;es, and, if po&s;&s;ible, detect the impo&s;ture
of Can$$ng. Bills of perjury were preferred on both
&s;ides. T$e evidences for Squires were tried and acquitted:
at fir&s;t Canning ab&s;conded; but afterwards &s;urrendered
to take her trial, and being after a long hearing found
$uilty, was $ran&s;ported to the Briti&s;h colonies. The
<PB N="332" REF="340">
zeal of her friends, however, &s;eemed to be inflamed
by her conviction; and tho&s;e who carried on the pro|&s;ecution
again&s;t her were in&s;ulted, even to the dan|ger
of their lives. They &s;upplied her with nece&s;&s;aries
of all &s;orts, paid for her tran&s;portation in a private &s;hip,
where &s;he enjoyed all the comforts and conveniencies that
could be afforded in that &s;ituation, and furni&s;hed her with
&s;uch recommendations as &s;ecured to her a very agreeable
reception in New-England.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. Next to this very remarkable tran&s;action,
the incident that principally di&s;tingui&s;hed this year in
England, was the execution of Dr. Archibald Cameron,
a native of North-Britain, and brother to Cameron of
Lochiel, chief of that numerous and warlike tribe, who
had taken the field with the Prince-Pretender. After the
battle of Culloden, where he was dangerou&s;ly wounded,
he found means to e&s;cape to the continent. His brother,
the Doctor, had accompanied him in all his expeditions,
though not in a military capacity, and was included with
him in the act of attainder pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e who had
been concerned in the rebellion. Notwith&s;tanding the
imminent danger attending &s;uch an attempt, the Doctor
returned privately to Scotland, in order (as it was reported)
to recover a &s;um of money belonging to the Pretender,
which had been embezzled by his adherents in that coun|try.
Whatever may have been his inducement to revi&s;it
his native country under &s;uch a predicament, certain it is,
he was di&s;covered, apprehended, conducted to London,
confined in the Tower, examined by the privy-council,
and produced in the court of King's-Bench, where h$s
identity being proved by &s;everal witne&s;&s;es, he received &s;$n|tence
of death, and was executed at Tyburn. The ter|ror
and re&s;entment of the people, occa&s;ioned $y the
rebellion, having by this time &s;ub&s;ided, their $umane
pa&s;&s;ions did not fail to operate in favour of this u$$ortunate
gentleman: their pity was mingled with e&s;tem, ari&s;ing
from his per&s;onal character, which was alto$$ther unble|mi&s;hed,
and his deportment on this occa&s;i$$, which they
could not help admiring, as the &s;tandard of manly forti|tude
<PB N="333" REF="341">
and decorum. The populace, though not very
&s;ubject to tender emotions, were moved to compa&s;&s;ion and
even to tears, by his behaviour at the place of execution;
and many &s;incere well-wi&s;hers to the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment
thought that the &s;acrifice of this victim, at &s;uch a junc|ture,
could not redound either to its honour or &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. The turbulent &s;pirit, which is never
totally extingui&s;hed in this i&s;land, manife&s;ted it&s;elf in
&s;undry tumults that broke out in different parts of South-Britain.
The price of provi&s;ion, and bread in particular,
being rai&s;ed to an exorbitant rate, in con&s;equence of an
ab&s;urd exportation of corn, for the &s;ake of the bounty, a
formidable body of colliers and other labouring people
rai&s;ed an in&s;urrection at Bri&s;tol, began to plunder the
corn-ve&s;&s;els in the harbour, and commit &s;uch outrages in
the city, that the magi&s;trates were obliged to have recour&s;e
to the military power. A troop of dragoons were &s;ent to
their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the in&s;urgents were quelled, though
not without &s;ome blood&s;hed. Commotions of the &s;ame
kind were excited in York&s;hire, Manche&s;ter, and &s;everal
other places in the northern counties. At Leeds, a de|tachment
of the King's troops were obliged in their own
defence to fire upon the rioters, eight or nine of whom
were killed on the &s;pot; and, indeed, &s;o little care had
been taken to re&s;train the licentious in&s;olence of the vul|gar
by proper laws and regulations, duly executed under
the eye of civil magi&s;tracy, that a military power was
found ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to maintain the peace of the
kingdom.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. The tranquillity of the continent was not
endangered by any new conte&s;t or di&s;turbance: yet the
breach between the clergy and the parliament of Paris
was every day more and more widened, and the people
were pretty equally divided between &s;uper&s;tition and a re|gard
for civil liberty. The parliament having cau&s;ed
divers eccle&s;ia&s;ticks to be apprehended, for having refu&s;ed
to admini&s;ter the &s;acraments to per&s;ons in extremity, who
refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe to the bull Unigenitus, all of them
<PB N="334" REF="342">
declared they acted according to the direction of the Arch|bi&s;hop
of Paris. Application being made to this haughty
prelate, he treated the deputies of the parliament with the
mo&s;t &s;upercilious contempt, and even &s;eemed to brave the
power and authority of that body. They, on the other
hand, proceeded to take cognizance of the recu&s;ant clergy,
until their &s;overeign ordered them to de&s;i&s;t. Then they
pre&s;ented remon&s;trances to his Maje&s;ty, reminding him
of their privileges, and the duty of their &s;tation, which
obliged them to do ju&s;tice on all delinquents. In the
mean time, they continued to perform their functions,
and even commenced a pro&s;ecution again&s;t the Bi&s;hop of
Orleans, whom they &s;ummoned to attend their tribunal.
Next day they received from Ver&s;ailles a <HI>lettre de cachet,</HI>
accompanied by letters-patent, commanding them to &s;u&s;|pend
all pro&s;ecutions relating to the refu&s;al of the &s;acra|ments;
and ordering the letters-patent to be regi&s;tered.
In&s;tead of obeying the&s;e commands, they pre&s;ented new
remon&s;trances, for an&s;wers to which they were referred to
the King's former declarations. In con&s;equence of this
intimation, they had &s;pirit enough to re&s;olve, &startq;That,
whereas certain evil-minded per&s;ons had prevented truth
from reaching the throne, the chambers remained
a&s;&s;embled, and all other bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended.&endq;
The affair was now become very &s;erious. His Maje&s;ty,
by fre&s;h letters-patent, renewed his orders, and command|ed
them to proceed with their ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, on pain
of incurring his di&s;plea&s;ure. They forthwith came to
another re&s;olution, importing, that they could not obey
this injunction without a breach of their duty and their
oath. Next day <HI>lettres de cachet</HI> were i&s;&s;ued, bani&s;hing to
different parts of the kingdom all the members, except
tho&s;e of the great chamber, which the court did not find
more tractable than their brethren. They forthwith re|&s;olved
to abide by the two re&s;olutions mentioned above;
and, as an in&s;tance of their un&s;haken fortitude, ordered an
eccle&s;ia&s;tick to be taken into cu&s;tody for refu&s;ing the &s;acra|ments.
This &s;pirited mea&s;ure involved them in the fate
<PB N="335" REF="343">
of the re&s;t; for they were al&s;o exiled from Paris, the citi|zens
of which did not fail to extol their conduct with the
loude&s;t encomiums, and at the &s;ame time to expre&s;s their
re&s;entment again&s;t the clergy, who could not &s;tir abroad
without being expo&s;ed to violence or in&s;ult. The ex|ample
of the parliament of Paris was followed by that of
Rouen, which had courage enough to i&s;&s;ue orders for ap|prehending
the Bi&s;hop of Evreux, becau&s;e he had refu&s;ed
to appear when &s;ummoned to their tribunal. Their de|crees
on this occa&s;ion being annulled by the King's council
of &s;tate, they pre&s;ented a bold remon&s;trance, which, how|ever,
had no other effect than that of exa&s;perating the
mini&s;try. A grand deputation being ordered to attend
the King, they were commanded to de&s;i&s;t from intermed|dling
in di&s;putes relating to the refu&s;al of the &s;acraments,
and to regi&s;ter this injunction. At their return they had
recour&s;e to a new remon&s;trance; and one of their princi|pal
coun&s;ellors, who had &s;poken freely in the debate on
this &s;ubject, was arre&s;ted by a party of dragoons, who
carried him pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle of Dourlens. In a word,
the body of the people declared for the parliament, in
oppo&s;ition to eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny; and, had they not been
overawed by a formidable &s;tanding army, would certainly
have taken up arms in defence of their liberties; while the
monarch weakly &s;uffered him&s;elf to be governed by prie&s;tly
delu&s;ions; and, &s;ecure in his military appointments, &s;eem|ed
to &s;et the re&s;t of his &s;ubjects at defiance. Apprehen&s;ive,
however, that the&s;e di&s;putes would put an entire &s;top to
the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, he, by letters-patent, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
a royal chamber for the pro&s;ecution of &s;uits civil
and criminal, which was opened with a &s;olemn ma&s;s per|formed
in the Queen's chapel at the Louvre, where all
the members a&s;&s;i&s;ted. On this occa&s;ion another difficulty
occurred. The letters-patent con&s;tituting this new court
ought to have been regi&s;tered by the parliament, which
was now no more. To remedy this defect, application
was made to the inferior courts of the Chatelet; which
refu&s;ing to regi&s;ter them, one of its members was commit|ted
<PB N="336" REF="344">
to the Ba&s;tile, and another ab&s;conded. Intimidated
by this exertion of de&s;potick power, they allowed the
King's officers to enter the letters in their regi&s;ter; but
afterwards adopted more vigorous re&s;olutions. The lieu|tenant
civil appearing in their court, all the coun&s;ellors
ro&s;e up and retired, leaving him alone, and on the table
an arret, importing, That whereas the confinement of
one of their members, the per&s;ecution of another, who
dur&s;t not appear, and the pre&s;ent calamities of the nation,
gave them ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion for their own per&s;ons, they
had, after mature deliberation, thought proper to retire.
Thus a dangerous ferment was excited by the King's e&s;|pou&s;ing
the cau&s;e of &s;piritual in&s;olence and oppre&s;&s;ion
again&s;t the general voice of his people, and the plaine&s;t
dictates of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. The property of Ea&s;t Frie&s;eland continued
&s;till to be the &s;ource of contention between the Electors of
Brandenburgh and Hanover. The intere&s;ts of his Britan|nick
Maje&s;ty being powerfully &s;upported by the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria, the mini&s;ter of that power at the diet propo&s;ed
that the affair &s;hould be taken into immediate con&s;ideration.
He was &s;econded by the mini&s;ter of Brun&s;wick; but the
envoy from Brandenburgh having prote&s;ted in form again&s;t
this procedure, withdrew from the a&s;&s;embly, and the
Brun&s;wick mini&s;ter made a counter prote&s;tation, after
which he al&s;o retired. Then a motion being made, tha$
this di&s;pute &s;hould be referred to the deci&s;ion of the Aulic$
council at Vienna, it was carried in the affirmative by $
majority of fourteen voices. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's fina$
declaration with regard to this affair was afterwards pre|&s;ented
to the diet, and an&s;wered in the &s;equel by a memo|rial
from his Britannick Maje&s;ty as Elector of Hanover.
Some other petty di&s;putes likewi&s;e happened between the
regency of Hanover, and the city of Mun&s;ter; and the
former claiming &s;ome bailiwicks in the territories of Bre|men,
&s;eque&s;tered certain revenues belonging to this city
in Stade and Ferden, till the&s;e claims &s;hould be &s;atisfied.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="345">
&sect; XXXV. The court of Vienna having dropped for the
pre&s;ent the &s;cheme of electing a king of the Romans, con|cluded
a very extraordinary treaty with the Duke of Mo|dena,
&s;tipulating, that his &s;erene highne&s;s &s;hould be ap|pointed
perpetual governor of the duchy of Milan, with
a &s;alary of ninety thou&s;and florins, on condition that he
&s;hould maintain a body of four thou&s;and men, to be at the
di&s;po&s;al of the Empre&s;s-Queen; that her Imperial Maje&s;ty
&s;hould have a right to place garri&s;ons in the citadels of
Mirandola and Reggio, as well as in the ca&s;tle of Ma&s;&s;a-Carrara:
that the Archduke Peter Leopold, third &s;on of
their Imperial Maje&s;ties, &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the daughter of
the Hereditary Prince of Modena by the heire&s;s of Ma&s;&s;a-Carrara;
and, in ca&s;e of her dying without heirs male,
the e&s;tates of that hou&s;e and the duchy of Mirandola &s;hould
devolve to the Archduke; but in ca&s;e of her having male
i&s;&s;ue, that &s;he &s;hould enjoy the principality of Fermia, and
other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Hungary, claimed by the Duke of
Modena, for her fortune: finally, that on the extinction
of the male branch of the hou&s;e of E&s;te, all the dominions
of the Duke of Modena &s;hould devolve to the hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. While the powers on the continent of Eu|rope
were thus employed in &s;trengthening their re&s;pective
intere&s;ts, and concerting mea&s;ures for preventing any in|terruption
of the general tranquillity, matters were fa&s;t
ripening to a fre&s;h rupture between the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain
and France, in different parts of North-America.
We have already ob&s;erved that commi&s;&s;aries had been ap|pointed,
and conferences opened at Paris, to determine
the di&s;putes between the two crowns, relating to the
boundaries of Nova-Scotia; and we took notice in general
of the little arts of eva&s;ion practi&s;ed by the French com|mi&s;&s;aries,
to darken and perplex the di&s;pute, and elude
the preten&s;ions of his Britannick Maje&s;ty. They per|&s;i&s;ted
in employing the&s;e arts of chicanery and cavil with
&s;uch per&s;everance, that the negociation proved abortive,
the conferences broke up, and every thing &s;eemed to por|tend
<PB N="338" REF="346">
approaching ho&s;tilities. But, before we proceed to
a detail of the incidents which were the immediate fore-runners
of the war, we will endeavour to convey a ju&s;t
idea of the di&s;pute concerning Nova-Scotia; which, we
apprehend, is but imperfectly under&s;tood, though of the
utmo&s;t importance to the intere&s;t of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. Nova-Scotia, called by the French Acadia,
lies between the forty-fourth and fiftieth degrees of north
latitude, having New-England and the Atlantick ocean
to the &s;outh and &s;outh-we&s;t, and the river and gulf of St.
Laurence to the north and north-ea&s;t. The winter,
which continues near &s;even months in this $ountry, is in|ten&s;ely
cold; and, without the intervention of any thing
that can be called &s;pring, it is immediately &s;ucceeded by a
&s;ummer, the heat of which is almo&s;t in&s;upportable, but
of no long continuance. The &s;oil in general is thin and
barren, though &s;ome parts of it are &s;aid to be equal to the
be&s;t land in England. The whole country is covered with
a perpetual fog, even after the &s;ummer has commenced.
It was fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the French, before they made any
e&s;tabli&s;hment in Canada; who, by dint of indu&s;try and in|defatigable
per&s;everance, in &s;truggling with the many
difficulties they nece&s;&s;arily laboured under in the infancy
of this &s;ettlement, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted tolerably well, and increa&s;ed
con&s;iderably, with very little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Europe;
whil&s;t we even now &s;hould lo&s;e the immen&s;e expen&s;e we
have already been at to &s;ettle a colony there, and &s;hould
&s;ee all our endeavours to that end defeated, if the &s;upport
of the royal hand was withdrawn but for a moment. This
country, by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which an enemy would be
enabled greatly to annoy all our other colonies, and, if in
the hands of the French, would be of &s;ingular &s;ervice
both to their fi&s;hery and their &s;ugar i&s;lands, has frequently
changed hands from the French to the Engli&s;h, and from
the Engli&s;h back again to the French, till our right to it
was finally &s;ettled by the twelfth article of the treaty of
Utrecht, by which all the country included within the
ancient limits of what was called Nova-Scotia, or Acadia,
<PB N="339" REF="347">
was ceded to the Engli&s;h. This article was confirmed
by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle; but for want of a&s;|certaining
di&s;tinctly what were the bounds intended to be
fixed by the two nations with re&s;pect to this province,
di&s;putes aro&s;e, and commi&s;&s;aries, as we have ob&s;erved,
were appointed by both &s;ides, to adju&s;t the litigation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The commi&s;&s;aries of the King of Great-Britain
conformed them&s;elves to the rule laid down by the
treaty it&s;elf, and a&s;&s;igned tho&s;e as the ancient limits of this
country which had always pa&s;&s;ed as &s;uch, from the very
earlie&s;t time of any certainty, down to the conclu&s;ion of
the treaty; which the two crowns had frequently declared
to be &s;uch, and which the French had often admitted
and allowed. The&s;e limits are, the &s;outhern bank of the
river St. Laurence to the north, and Pentagoet to the
we&s;t: the country &s;ituated between the&s;e boundaries is
that which the French received by the treaty of St. Ger|main's,
in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty-two,
under the general name of Acadia. Of this coun|try,
thus limited, they continued in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion from that
period to the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-four,
when a de&s;cent was made upon it, under the command of
Colonel Sedgwick. That the&s;e were then the undi&s;puted
limits of Acadia his Britannick Maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;aries
plainly proved, by a letter of Louis XIII. to the Sieurs
Charni&s;ay and La Tour, regulating their juri&s;dictions in
Acadia; by the &s;ub&s;equent commi&s;&s;ions of the French
King to the &s;ame per&s;ons, as governours of Acadia, in
$he &s;equel; and by that which was afterwards granted to
$he Sieur Denys, in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred
and fifty-four; all of which extend the bounds of this
country from the river St. Laurence to Pentagoet and
New-England. That the&s;e were the notions of the French
with re&s;pect to the ancient limits of this province was
$urther confirmed by the demand made by their amba&s;&s;a|dor,
in the cour&s;e of that &s;ame year, for the re&s;titution of
$he &s;orts Pentagoet, St. John's, and Port-Royal, as forts
$$tuated in Acadia. In the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred
<PB N="340" REF="348">
and &s;ixty-two, upon the revival of the claim of France to
the country of Acadia, which had been left undecided by
the treaty of We&s;tmin&s;ter, the French amba&s;&s;ador, then
at the court of London, a&s;&s;igned Pentagoet as the we&s;tern,
and the river St. Laurence as the northern boundary of
that country; and alledged the re&s;titution of Acadia in the
year one thou&s;and &s;ix hunded and thirty-two, and the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion taken by France in con&s;equence thereof, as well
as the continuation of that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, with the &s;ame limits,
to the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and fifty-four, a$
proofs of the equity and validity of the claim he then made $word$
in which claim, and in the manner of &s;upporting it, he
was particularly approved of by the court of France.
The &s;ame court afterwards thought it &s;o clear, upon forme
determinations, and her own former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that th$
true ancient boundaries of Acadia were Pentagoet to th$
we&s;t, and the river St. Laurence to the north, that &s;h$
de&s;ired no &s;pecification of limits in the treaty of Breda, b$$
was contented with the re&s;titution of Acadia, generall
named: and, upon a di&s;pute which aro&s;e in the executio$
of this treaty, France re-a&s;&s;erted, and Great-Britain
after &s;ome di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, agreed to the above-mentione$
limits of Acadia; and France obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of th$
country, &s;o bounded, under the treaty of Breda. T$$
&s;en&s;e of France upon this &s;ubject, in the years one thou|&s;and &s;ix
hundred and eighty-five, and one thousand $ hundred and eighty-&s;even, was al&s;o clearly manife&s;ted, $word$
the memorials delivered at that time by the French am|ba&s;&s;ador
at the court of London, complaining of &s;on
encroachments made by the Engli&s;h upon the coa&s;t $word$
Acadia: he de&s;cribed the country as extending from i$
Per$ee, which lies at the entrance of the river S$
Laurence, to St. George's i&s;land: and again, in a &s;u$$$quent
complaint, made by Mon&s;. Barillon and Mon&s;. $word$
$onrepaus to the court of Great-Britain, again&s;t $word$
judge of Pemaquid, for having &s;ei&s;ed the effects of
French merchant at Pentagoet, which, &s;aid they, w$
&s;ituated in Acadia, as re&s;tored to France by the treaty $word$
<PB N="341" REF="349">
Breda. To explain the &s;en&s;e of France, touching the
bounds of Acadia in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred,
the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;aries produced a propo&s;al of the French
amba&s;&s;ador, then re&s;iding in Great-Britain, to re&s;train
the limits of that country to the river St. George. They
al&s;o in&s;tanced the &s;urrender of Port-Royal in the year one
thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ten, in which Acadia is de|&s;cribed
with the &s;ame limits with which France had re|ceived
it in the years one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty-two,
and one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-&s;even.
And further to a&s;certain the &s;en&s;e of both crowns, even
at the treaty of Utrecht it&s;elf, they produced the Queen of
Great-Britain's in&s;tructions to her amba&s;&s;adors in the year
one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eleven, in which they
were directed to in&s;i&s;t, &startq;That his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Ma|je&s;ty
&s;hould quit all claim or title, by virtue of any
former treaty, or otherwi&s;e, to the country called
Nova-Scotia, and expre&s;sly to Port-Royal, otherwi&s;e
Annapolis-Royal.&endq; To the&s;e they added a manife&s;t de|mon&s;tration,
founded on indi&s;putable facts, proving,
that the recital of the &s;everal &s;orts of the right which France
had ever pretended to this country, and the &s;pecification
of both terms, Acadia, or Nova-Scotia, were intended by
Great-Britain to obviate all doubts which had ever been
made concerning the limits of Acadia and to comprehend
with more certainty all that country which France had
ever received as &s;uch: finally, to &s;pecify what France
con&s;idered as Acadia, during the treaty they referred to
the offers of that crown in the year one thousand &s;even
hundred and twelve, in which &s;he propo&s;ed to re&s;train the
boundary of Acadia to the river St. George, as a depar|ture
from its real boundary, in ca&s;e Great-Britain would
re&s;tore to her the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that country. From all
the&s;e facts it plainly appears, that Great-Britain demanded
nothing but what the fair con&s;truction of the words of the
treaty of Utrecht nece&s;&s;arily implies; and that it is impo&s;|&s;ible
for any thing to have more evident marks of candour
and fairne&s;s in it, than the demand of the Engli&s;h on this
<PB N="342" REF="350">
occa&s;ion. From the variety of evidence brought in &s;up|port
of this claim, it evidently re&s;ults, that the Engli&s;h
commi&s;&s;aries a&s;&s;igned no limits as the ancient limits of
Acadia, but tho&s;e which France her&s;elf determined to be
&s;uch in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and thirty-two;
and which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;d, in con&s;equence of that determi|nation,
till the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and fifty-four;
that in one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-two
France claimed, and received in one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred
and &s;ixty-nine, the country which Great-Britain now
claims as Acadia, re&s;tored to France by the treaty of
Breda, under that general denomination: that France
never con&s;idered Acadia as having any other limits than
tho&s;e which were a&s;&s;igned to it from the year one thou&s;and
&s;ix hundred and thirty-two, to the year one thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and ten; and that, by the treaty of Utrecht, &s;he
engaged to transfer that very &s;ame country, as Acadia,
which France has always a&s;&s;erted and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and Great-Britain
now claims, as &s;uch. Should the crown of
France, therefore, be ever willing to decide what are the
ancient limits of Acadia, by her own declarations &s;o fre|quently
made in like di&s;cu&s;&s;ions upon the &s;ame point, by
her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of this country for almo&s;t a century, and
by her de&s;cription of Acadia, during the negociation of
that very treaty upon which this doubt is rai&s;ed, &s;he can|not
but admit the claim of Great-Britain to be conform|able
to the treaty of Utrecht, and to the de&s;cription of
the country transferred to Great-Britain by the twelfth
article of that treaty. There is a con&s;i&s;tency in the claim
of the Engli&s;h, and a completene&s;s in the evidence brought
in &s;upport of it, which is &s;eldom &s;een in di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of
this &s;ort; for it rarely happens, in di&s;putes of &s;uch a
nature between two crowns, that either of them can &s;afely
offer to have its preten&s;ions decided by the known and re|peated
declarations, or the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the other. To
an&s;wer the force of this detail of conclu&s;ive hi&s;torical facts,
and to give a new turn to the real que&s;tion in di&s;pute, the
French commi&s;&s;aries, in their memorial, laid it down as a
<PB N="343" REF="351">
di&s;tinction made by the treaty of Utrecht, that the ancient
limits of Acadia, referred to by that treaty, are different
from any with which that country may have pa&s;&s;ed under
the treaties of St. Germain's and Breda; and then endea|voured
to &s;how, upon the te&s;timonies of maps and hi&s;to|rians,
that Acadia and its limits were anciently confined to
the &s;outh-ea&s;tern part of the penin&s;ula. In &s;upport of this
&s;y&s;tem, the French commi&s;&s;aries had recour&s;e to ancient
maps and hi&s;torians, who, as they a&s;&s;erted, had ever con|fined
Acadia to the limits they a&s;&s;igned. They alledged,
that tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ions of the French government over
Acadia, which the Engli&s;h cited as evidences of the limits
they claimed, were given as commi&s;&s;ions over Acadia and
the country around it, and not over Acadia only: that
the whole of the country claimed by the Engli&s;h as Acadia
could not po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed ever to be con&s;idered as &s;uch,
becau&s;e many parts of that territory always did, and &s;till
do, pre&s;erve particular and di&s;tinct names. They affirmed
New France to be a province in it&s;elf; and argued, that
many parts of what we claim as Acadia can never have
been in Acadia, becau&s;e hi&s;torians and the French com|mi&s;&s;ions
of government expre&s;sly place them in New
France. They a&s;&s;erted, that no evidence can be drawn
of the opinion of any crown, with re&s;pect to the limits of
any country, from its declaration during the negociation
of a treaty; and, in the end, relying upon maps and hi&s;to|rians
for the ancient limits of Acadia, they pretended that
the expre&s;s re&s;titution of St. Germain's, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
taken by France in con&s;equence of the treaty of Breda,
after a long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the limits, and the declaration of
France during the negociation of the treaty of Utrecht,
were foreign to the point in que&s;tion. In refutation of
the&s;e maxims, the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;aries proved, from an
examination of the maps and hi&s;torians cited by the French
in &s;upport of their &s;y&s;tem, that if this que&s;tion was to be
decided upon the authorities which they them&s;elves allow|ed
to belong, and to be applicable, to this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the
limits which they a&s;&s;igned were utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with
<PB N="344" REF="352">
the be&s;t maps of all countries, which are authorities in
point for almo&s;t every part of the claim of Great-Britain.
They &s;howed, that the French hi&s;torians, Champlain and
Denys, and particularly this la&s;t, with his commi&s;&s;ion
in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and fifty-five, a&s;&s;ign|ed
the &s;ame northern and we&s;tern limits to Acadia which
they did; and that E&s;carbot, another of their hi&s;torians,
as far as any evidence can be drawn from his writings,
agrees entirely with the former two. They ob&s;erved,
that all the&s;e evidences fall in with and confirm the better
authorities of treaties, and the &s;everal tran&s;actions be|tween
the two crowns for near a century pa&s;t; and that
the French commi&s;&s;aries, by deviating from treaties, and
the late proceedings of the two crowns, to ancient hi&s;to|rians
and maps, only made a tran&s;ition from an authen|tick
to an in&s;ufficient &s;ort of evidence; and led the Engli&s;h
commi&s;&s;aries into an enquiry, which proved, that both
the proper and the improper, the regular and the foreign
evidence, upon which this matter had been re&s;ted,
equally confuted the limits alledged by the French com|mi&s;&s;aries
as the ancient limits of Acadia.</P>

<P>&sect; I. WHILE the Briti&s;h mini&s;try depended upon the
&s;ucce&s;s of the conferences between the com|mi&s;&s;aries
of the two crowns at Paris, the French were
actually employed in executing their plans of encroach|ment
upon the Briti&s;h colonies in North-America. Their
&s;cheme was to engro&s;s the whole fur-trade of that conti|nent;
and they had already made great progre&s;s in extend|ing
a chain of forts, connecting their &s;ettlements on the
river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi with their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Canada, along the
great lakes of Erie and Ontario, which la&s;t i&s;&s;ues into the
river St. Laurence. By the&s;e means they hoped to ex|clude
the Engli&s;h from all communication and traffick
with the Indian nations, even tho&s;e that lay contiguous to
the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements, and confine them within a line of
their drawing, beyond which they &s;hould neither extend
their trade nor plantations. Their commercial &s;pirit did
not keep pace with the gigantick &s;trides of their ambition:
they could not &s;upply all tho&s;e Indians with the nece&s;&s;a|ries
they wanted, &s;o that many of the natives had recour&s;e
to the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements; and this commerce produced a
connexion, in con&s;equence of which the Briti&s;h adven|tures
ventured to travel with merchandi&s;e as far as the
banks of the river Ohio, that runs into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, a
great way on the other &s;ide of the Apalachian mountains,
beyond which none of our coloni&s;ts had ever attempted to
penetrate. The tract of country lying along the Ohio is
&s;o fertile, plea&s;ant, and inviting, and the Indians, called
Twightees, who inhabit tho&s;e delightful plains, were &s;o
well di&s;po&s;ed towards a clo&s;e alliance with the Engli&s;h,
that, as far back as the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and &s;ixteen, Mr. Spot&s;wood, governor of Virginia, pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="347" REF="355">
a plan for erecting a company to &s;ettle &s;uch lands
upon this river as &s;hould be ceded to them by treaty with
the natives; but the de&s;ign was at that time fru&s;trated,
partly by the indolence and timidity of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try,
who were afraid of giving umbrage to the French, and
partly by the jealou&s;ies and divi&s;ions &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between
the different colonies of Great-Britain. The very &s;ame
circum&s;tances encouraged the French to proceed in their
project of inva&s;ion. At length they penetrated from the
banks of the river St. Laurence, acro&s;s lake Champlain,
and upon the territory of New York built with impunity,
and, indeed, without oppo&s;ition, the fort of Crown Point,
the mo&s;t in&s;olent and dangerous encroachment that they
had hitherto carried into execution.</P>
<P>&sect; II. Governor Spot&s;wood's &s;cheme for an Ohio compa|ny
was revived immediately after the peace of Aix-la-Cha|pelle,
when certain merchants of London, who traded to
Maryland and Virginia, petitioned the government on
this &s;ubject, and were indulged not only with a grant of a
great tract of ground to the &s;outhward of Penn&s;ylvania,
which they promi&s;ed to &s;ettle; but al&s;o with an exclu&s;ive
privilege of trading with the Indians on the banks of the
river Ohio. This de&s;ign no &s;ooner tran&s;pired, than the
French governor of Canada took the alarm, and wrote let|ters
to the governors of New-York and Penn&s;ylvania,
giving them to under&s;tand, that as the Engli&s;h inland
traders had encroached on the French territories and pri|vileges,
by trading with the Indians under the protection
of his &s;overeign, he would &s;eize them wherever they could
be found, if they did not immediately de&s;i&s;t from that
illicit practice. No regard being paid to this intimation,
he next year cau&s;ed three Briti&s;h traders to be arre&s;ted.
Their effects were confi&s;cated, and they them&s;elves con|veyed
to Quebeck, from whence they were &s;ent pri&s;oners to
Rochelle in France, and there detained in confinement.
In this &s;ituation they pre&s;ented a remon&s;trance to the Earl
of Albermorle, at that time Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador in Paris,
and he claiming them as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, they were &s;et at
<PB N="348" REF="356">
liberty. Although, in an&s;wer to his lord&s;hip's memorial,
the court of Ver&s;ailles promi&s;ed to tran&s;mit orders to the
French governors in America to u&s;e all their endeavours
for preventing any di&s;putes that might have a tendency to
alter the good corre&s;pondence e&s;tabli&s;hed between the two
nations; in all probability the directions given were &s;eem|ingly
the very rever&s;e of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, for the French
commanders, parti&s;ans, and agents in America took every
&s;tep their bu&s;y genius could &s;ugge&s;t, to &s;trengthen their
own power, and weaken the influence of the Engli&s;h, by
embroiling them with the Indian nations. This ta&s;k they
found the more ea&s;y, as the natives had taken offence
again&s;t the Engli&s;h, when they under&s;tood that their lands
were given away without their knowledge, and that there
was a de&s;ign to build forts in their country, without their
con&s;ent and concurrence. Indeed, the per&s;on whom the
new company employed to &s;urvey the banks of the Ohio
concealed his de&s;ign &s;o carefully, and behaved in other re|&s;pects
in &s;uch a dark my&s;terious manner, as could not fail to
arou&s;e the jealou&s;y of a people naturally inqui&s;itive, and
very much addicted to &s;u&s;picion. How the company
propo&s;ed to &s;ettle this acqui&s;ition in de&s;pite of the native
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors it is not ea&s;y to conceive, and it is &s;till more
unaccountable that they &s;hould have neglected the natives,
who&s;e con&s;ent and a&s;&s;i&s;tance they might have procured at a
very &s;mall expen&s;e. In&s;tead of acting &s;uch a fair, open,
and honourable part, they &s;ent a Mr. Gi&s;t to make a clan|de&s;tine
&s;urvey of the country, as far as the falls of the river
Ohio; and, as we have ob&s;erved above, his conduct alarm|ed
both the French and Indians. The erection of this
company was equally di&s;agreeable to the &s;eparate traders of
Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania, who &s;aw them&s;elves on the
eve of being deprived of a valuable branch of traffick, by
the exclu&s;ive charter of a monopoly; and therefore they
employed their emi&s;&s;aries to foment the jealou&s;y of the
Indians.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The French having in a manner commenced
ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Engli&s;h, and actually built forts on
<PB N="349" REF="357">
the territories of the Briti&s;h allies at Niagara, and on the
lake Erie, Mr. Hamilton, governor of Penn&s;ylvania, com|municated
this intelligence to the a&s;&s;embly of the province,
and repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of erecting truck-hou&s;es, or
places of &s;trength and &s;ecurity, on the river Ohio, to which
the traders might retire, in ca&s;e of in&s;ult or mole&s;tation.
The propo&s;al was approved, and money granted for the
purpo&s;e; but the a&s;&s;embly could not agree about the man|ner
in which they &s;hould be erected; and in the mean time
the French fortified them&s;elves at lei&s;ure, and continued to
harra&s;s the traders belonging to the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements.
Repeated complaints of the&s;e encroachments and depreda|tions
being repre&s;ented to Mr. Dinwiddie, governor of Vir|ginia,
he, towards the latter end of this very year, &s;ent
Major Wa&s;hington with a letter to the commanding officer
of a fort which the French had built on the Riviere-au-Beuf,
which falls into the Ohio, not far from the lake Erie.
In this letter Mr. Dinwiddie expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e that the
French &s;hould build forts and make &s;ettlements on the
river Ohio, in the we&s;tern part of the colony of Virginia,
belonging to the crown of Great-Britain. He complained
of the&s;e encroachments, as well as of the injuries done to
the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, in open violation of the law
of nations, and of the treaties actually &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between
the two crowns. He de&s;ired to know by who&s;e authority
and in&s;tructions his Britannick Maje&s;ty's territories had
been invaded; and required him to depart in peace with|out
further pro&s;ecuting a plan which mu&s;t interrupt the
harmony and good under&s;tanding which his Maje&s;ty was
de&s;irous to continue and cultivate with the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
King. To this &s;pirited intimation the officer replied,
That it was not his province to &s;pecify the evidence, and
demon&s;trate the right of the King his ma&s;ter to the lands
&s;ituated on the river Ohio; but he would tran&s;mit the letter
to the Marquis du Que&s;ne, and act according to the an&s;wer
he &s;hould receive from that nobleman. In the mean time, he
&s;aid he did not think him&s;elf obliged to obey the &s;ummons of
the Engli&s;h governor; that he commanded the fort by vir|tue
<PB N="350" REF="358">
of an order from his general, to which he was deter|mined
to conform with all the preci&s;ion and re&s;olution of a
good officer. Mr. Dinwiddie expected no other reply, and
therefore had projected a fort to be erected near the forks
of the river. The province undertook to defray the ex|pen&s;e,
and the &s;tores for that purpo&s;e were already provid|ed;
but, by &s;ome fatal over&s;ight, the concurrence of the
Indians was neither obtained nor &s;ollicited, and, therefore,
they looked upon this mea&s;ure with an evil eye, as a ma|nife&s;t
inva&s;ion of their property.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. While the French thus indu&s;triou&s;ly extended
their encroachments to the &s;outhward, they were not idle
in the gulf of St. Laurence, but &s;ei&s;ed every opportunity
of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the Engli&s;h &s;ettlement of Nova-Scotia. We
have already ob&s;erved, that the town of Halifax was no
&s;ooner built, than they &s;pirited up the Indians of that
neighbourhood to commit ho&s;tilities again&s;t the inhabi|tants,
&s;ome of whom they murthered, and others they car|ried
pri&s;oners to Loui&s;bourg, where they &s;old them for arms
and ammunition, the French pretending that they main|tained
this traffick from motives of pure compa&s;&s;ion, in
order to prevent the ma&s;&s;acre of the Engli&s;h captives,
whom, however, they did not &s;et at liberty, without exact|ing
an exorbitant ran&s;om. As the&s;e &s;culking parties of
Indians were generally directed and headed by French
commanders, repeated complaints were made to the gover|nor
of Loui&s;bourg, who &s;till an&s;wered, that his juri&s;diction
did not extend over the Indians, and that their French con|ductors
were cho&s;en from the inhabitants of Annapolis,
who thought proper to remain in that country after it was
ceded to the Engli&s;h, and were in fact the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain.
Even while the conferences were carried on for a&s;|certaining
the limits of Nova-Scotia the governor of Canada
detached M. La Corne, with &s;ome regular troops, and a
body of militia, to fortify a po&s;t on the bay of Chignecto,
on pretence that this and a great part of the penin&s;ula be|longed
to his government. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this po&s;t not
only &s;ecured to the Indians of the continent a free entrance
<PB N="351" REF="359">
into the penin&s;ula, and a &s;afe retreat in ca&s;e of pur&s;uit;
but al&s;o encouraged the French inhabitants of Annapolis to
ri&s;e in open rebellion again&s;t the Engli&s;h government.</P>
<P>&sect; V. In the &s;pring of the year one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred
and fifty, General Cornwallis, governor of Halifax,
detached Major Laurence with a few men to reduce them
to obedience. At his approach they burned their town to
a&s;hes, for&s;ook their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and threw them&s;elves under
the protection of M. La Corne, who, thus re-enforced,
found him&s;elf at the head of fifteen hundred men, well
provided with arms and ammunition. Major Laurence
being unable to cope with him in the field, demanded an
interview, at which he de&s;ired to know for what cau&s;e the
French inhabitants of Nova-Scotia had &s;haken off their
allegiance to the Crown of Great-Britain, and violated the
neutrality which they had hitherto affected to profe&s;s.
The French officer, without pretending to account for
their behaviour, gave him to under&s;tand in general terms,
that he had orders to defend his po&s;t, and the&s;e orders he
was determined to obey. The Engli&s;h Major finding
him&s;elf too weak to attack their united force, and having
no orders to commit ho&s;tilities again&s;t any but the Indians
and their open abettors, returned to Halifax, without having
been able to fulfil the purpo&s;e of his expedition. Imme|diately
after his retreat, the French neutrals (&s;o they were
called) returned to the habitations which they had aban|doned;
and, in conjunction with the Indians, renewed
their depredations upon the inhabitants of Halifax and its
dependent &s;ettlements. The Engli&s;h governor, ju&s;tly in|cen&s;ed
at the&s;e outrages, and &s;eeing they would neither &s;ub|mit
to the Engli&s;h government them&s;elves, nor allow
others to enjoy it with tranquillity, re&s;olved to expel them
effectually from the country they &s;o ill de&s;erved to po&s;&s;e&s;s.
Major Laurence was again detached with a thou&s;and men,
tran&s;ported by &s;ea, to Chignecto, where he found the
French and Indians entrenched, in order to di&s;pute his
landing. Notwith&s;tanding this oppo&s;ition, he made a de|&s;cent
with a few companies, received and returned a &s;mart
<PB N="352" REF="360">
fire, and ru&s;hing into their entrenchments, obliged them to
fly with the utmo&s;t precipitation, leaving a con&s;iderable
number killed and wounded on the &s;pot. The fugitives
&s;aved them&s;elves by cro&s;&s;ing a river, on the farther bank
of which La Corne &s;tood at the head of his troops, drawn
up in order to receive them as friends and dependents. He
had by this time erected a fort, which he denominated Beau
Sejour; and now the Engli&s;h built another on the oppo|&s;ite
&s;ide of the river, which was called after its founder St.
Laurence. This being provided with a good garri&s;on,
&s;erved as a check upon the French, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure
re&s;trained the incur&s;ions of their barbarians. Not that it
effectually an&s;wered this purpo&s;e; for the Indians and neu|trals
&s;till &s;ei&s;ed every opportunity of attacking the Engli&s;h
in the interior parts of the penin&s;ula. In the cour&s;e of
the &s;ucceeding year they &s;urpri&s;ed the little town of Dart|mouth,
on the other &s;ide of Halifax-bay, where they killed
and &s;calped a great number of people, and carried off &s;ome
pri&s;oners. For the&s;e expeditions the French always &s;up|plied
them with boats, canoes, arms, and ammunition;
and indeed they were conducted with &s;uch care and &s;ecre|&s;y,
that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to prevent their &s;ucce&s;s.
One &s;ure remedy again&s;t the &s;udden and &s;tolen incur&s;ions
of tho&s;e &s;avages might have been found in the u&s;e of &s;taunch
hounds, which would have run upon the foot, detected the
&s;culking parties of the Indians, and fru&s;trated all their am|bu&s;cades:
but this expedient, &s;o ea&s;y and practicable, was
never tried, though frequently recommended in publick to
the attention of the government, and the con&s;ideration of
the coloni&s;ts. The Indians continued to plunder and
ma&s;&s;acre the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects with impunity, and were
countenanced by the French government in that country,
who now &s;trengthened their lodgement on the neck of the
penin&s;ula with an additional fort, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the
name of Baye-verte: and built a third at the mouth of St.
John's river, on the north &s;ide of the bay of Fundy.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. All the&s;e previous &s;teps to a rupture with Eng|land
were taken with great deliberation, while the com|mi&s;&s;aries
<PB N="353" REF="361">
of both nations were di&s;puting about the limits
of the very country which they thus arrogantly u&s;urped;
and they proceeded to perfect their chain of forts to the
&s;outhward, without paying the lea&s;t regard to the ex|po&s;tulations
of the Engli&s;h governors, or to a memorial
pre&s;ented at Ver&s;ailles by the Earl of Albermarle, the Briti&s;h
mini&s;ter. He demanded that expre&s;s orders &s;hould be &s;ent
to M. De la Jonquiere, the commander for the French in
America, to de&s;i&s;t from violence again&s;t the Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects
in that country: that the fort of Niagara &s;hould be
immediately ra&s;ed: that the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, who
had been made pri&s;oners, &s;hould be &s;et at liberty, and in|demnified
for the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained: and that the
per&s;ons who had committed tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es &s;hould be pu|ni&s;hed
in an exemplary manner. True it is, &s;ix Engli&s;h|men,
whom they had unju&s;tly taken, were immediately
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and the amba&s;&s;ador amu&s;ed with general pro|mi&s;es
of &s;ending &s;uch in&s;tructions to the French governor
in America, as &s;hould anticipate any cau&s;e of complaint for
the future: but, far from having any intention to perform
the&s;e promi&s;es, the court of Ver&s;ailles, without all doubt,
exhorted La Jonquiere to proceed in bringing its ambitious
&s;chemes to perfection.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. Every incident in America &s;eemed to progno&s;ti|cate
war, when the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was opened on the
fifteenth day of November: yet his Maje&s;ty, on this occa|&s;ion,
told them, That the events of the year had not made
it nece&s;&s;ary for him to offer any thing in particular to their
con&s;ideration, relating to foreign affairs. He even de|clared,
That the continuance of the publick tranquillity,
and the general &s;tate of Europe, remained upon the &s;ame
footing as when they la&s;t parted: and a&s;&s;ured them of his
&s;teadine&s;s in pur&s;uing the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures to pre|&s;erve
to his people the ble&s;&s;ings of peace. He expre&s;&s;ed
uncommon concern that the horrid crimes of robbery and
murther were of late rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed, and
earne&s;tly recommended this important object to their &s;e|rious
attention. Affectionate addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented by
<PB N="354" REF="362">
both Hou&s;es in an&s;wer to this harangue: and, what was
very remarkable, they were propo&s;ed and pa&s;&s;ed without
que&s;tion or debate.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The Commons continued the &s;ame number of
&s;eamen and land forces for the en&s;uing year which had
been granted in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, and made &s;uitable provi&s;ion
for all the exigencies of the &s;tate. The whole &s;upply
amounted to two millions &s;even hundred ninety-&s;even thou|&s;and
nine hundred and &s;ixteen pounds, ten &s;hillings, and
two-pence, to be rai&s;ed by a land tax of two &s;hillings in
the pound, a malt-tax, a continuation of certain duties on
wine, vinegar, cyder, and beer imported, a &s;um taken from
the &s;inking fund, and the overplus of certain grants, funds,
and duties. The provi&s;ions made con&s;iderably exceeded
the grants; but this exce&s;s was chargeable with the intere&s;t
of what &s;hould be borrowed upon the credit of the land or
malt-tax, there being a clau&s;e of credit in both, as al&s;o with
the deficiency (if any &s;hould happen) in the &s;ums they were
computed to produce. The Hou&s;e agreed to all the&s;e re|&s;olutions
almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly: indeed, no oppo&s;ition was
made to any of them, but that for continuing the &s;ame num|ber
of land forces, which was carried by a great majority.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The act permitting Jews to be naturalized,
which had, during the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, triumphed over &s;uch an
ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition, was by this time become the object of
national horror and execration. Every part of the king|dom
re&s;ounded with the reproach of the mini&s;try who had
enforced &s;uch an odious mea&s;ure; and the two brothers,
who engro&s;&s;ed the greater part of the admini&s;tration, trem|bled
at the pro&s;pect of what this clamour might produce at
the general election, this being the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the pre|&s;ent
parliament. So eager were the mini&s;ters to annul
this unpopolar mea&s;ure, that immediately after the Peers
had agreed to the nature and form of an addre&s;s to his Ma|je&s;ty,
the D&mdash;of N&mdash;, with that precipitation &s;o
peculiar to his character, poured $orth an abrupt harangue,
in that Hou&s;e, importing, that the di&s;affected had made an
handle of the act pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of the Jews,
<PB N="355" REF="363">
to rai&s;e di&s;contents among many of his Maje&s;ty's good
&s;ubjects; and as the act was in it&s;elf of little importance,
he was of opinion it ought to be repealed; for this purpo&s;e
he pre&s;ented a bill ready framed, which was read and com|mitted,
though not without &s;ome debate. The naturaliza|tion-bill,
now devoted as a &s;acrifice to the re&s;entment of
the people, contained a clau&s;e di&s;abling all naturalized Jews
from purcha&s;ing, inheriting, or receiving any advow&s;on or
pre&s;entation, or right to any eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefice or pro|motion,
&s;chool, ho&s;pital, or donative; and by the fir&s;t
draft of the bill, which his grace now pre&s;ented, it was
intended that this clau&s;e &s;hould not be repealed. It was
the opinion, however, of the majority, that &s;uch a clau&s;e
&s;tanding unrepealed might imply, that the Jews, by being
thus expre&s;sly excluded from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
right of pre&s;entation, would be con&s;idered as having
the power and privilege of purcha&s;ing and inheriting any
lay-property in the kingdom. On this con&s;ideration an
amendment was made in the bill, the clau&s;e in que&s;tion
was left out, and the whole act of naturalization repealed
without exception<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The reverend bench of bi&s;hops had, with a laudable &s;pirit of chri&s;tian meekne&s;s and philanthropy, generally approved of the indulgence granted to their Hebrew brethren; and now they acquie&s;ced in the propo&s;ed repeal with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ive di&s;cretion though one of the number contended for the &s;aving clau&s;e which the Duke of N&mdash;had recommended.</NOTE>. Though the Lords, in general, con|curred
in the expediency of the repeal, it was oppo&s;ed by
&s;ome few, as too great a &s;acrifice to the idle and unfounded
clamours of the multitude; and upon this &s;ide of the debate
a great power of elocution was di&s;played by Earl Temple,
who had lately &s;ucceeded to this title on the death of his
mother, a nobleman of di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, and the mo&s;t
amiable di&s;po&s;ition, frank, liberal, humane, and zealou&s;ly
attached to the intere&s;t and honour of his country. In the
Lower Hou&s;e the members of both parties &s;eemed to vie
with each other in demon&s;tration of aver&s;ion to this un|popular
act. On the very fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, imme|diately
after the motion for an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, Sir
James Da&s;hwood, an eminent leader in the oppo&s;ition,
<PB N="356" REF="364">
gave the Commons to under&s;tand, that he had a motion of
very great importance to make, which would require the
attention of every member, as &s;oon as the motion for the
addre&s;s &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: he, therefore, de&s;ired they
would not quit the Hou&s;e until he &s;hould have an oppor|tunity
to explain his propo&s;al. Accordingly, they had no
&s;ooner agreed to the motion for an addre&s;s of thanks to his
Maje&s;ty, than he &s;tood up again; and having expatiated
upon the ju&s;t and general indignation which the act of the
preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, in favour of the Jews, had rai&s;ed among
the people, he moved to order that the Hou&s;e &s;hould be
called over on Tue&s;day the fourth day of December, for
taking that act into con&s;ideration: but being given to un|der&s;tand
that it was not u&s;ual to appoint a call of the
Hou&s;e for any particular purpo&s;e, he agreed that the mo|tion
&s;hould be general. It was &s;econded by Lord Parker,
his oppo&s;ite in political intere&s;ts; the Hou&s;e agreed to it
without oppo&s;ition, and the call was ordered accordingly.
They were anticipated, however, by the Lords, who
framed and tran&s;mitted to them a bill on the &s;ame &s;ubject,
to the purport of which the Commons made no objection;
for every member, having the fear of the general election
before his eyes, carefully avoided every expre&s;&s;ion which
could give umbrage to his con&s;tituents: but violent op|po&s;ition
was made to the preamble, which ran in the fol|lowing
&s;train:&mdash;&startq;Whereas an act of parliament was
made and pa&s;&s;ed in the twenty-fifth year of his Maje&s;ty's
reign, intituled, An act to permit per&s;ons profe&s;&s;ing the
Jewi&s;h religion to be naturalized by parliament, and for
other purpo&s;es therein mentioned; and whereas occa|&s;ion
has been taken, from the &s;aid act, to rai&s;e di&s;con|tents
and di&s;quiets in the minds of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects,
be it enacted, &amp;c.&endq; This introduction was con&s;idered
as an unju&s;t reflexion upon the body of the people in ge|neral,
and in particular upon tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ed the
bill in the cour&s;e of the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion. Sir Roger New|digate
therefore moved that the expre&s;&s;ion &s;hould be varied
to this effect: &startq;Whereas great di&s;contents and di&s;quie|tudes
<PB N="357" REF="365">
had from the &s;aid act ari&s;en.&endq; The con&s;equence
of this motion was an ob&s;tinate debate, in which it was
&s;upported by the Earl of Eg&mdash;t, and divers other able
orators: but Mr. Pelham and Mr. P&mdash;were numbered
among its opponents. The que&s;tion being put for the
propo&s;ed alteration, it was of cour&s;e carried in the nega|tive:
the bill, after the third reading, pa&s;&s;ed <HI>nemine con|tradicente,</HI>
and in due time obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>&sect; X Even this conce&s;&s;ion of the mini&s;try did not allay
the re&s;entment of the people, and their apprehen&s;ions of
encroachment from the Jews. Another act &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted,
by virtue of which any per&s;on profe&s;&s;ing the Jewi&s;h reli|gion
might become a free denizen of Great-Britain, after
having re&s;ided &s;even years in any of his Maje&s;ty's colo|nies
in America; and this was now con&s;idered as a law
having the &s;ame dangerous tendency, of which the other
was now in a fair way of being convicted. It was
moved, therefore, in the Lower Hou&s;e, that part of this
former act might be read: then the &s;ame member made
a motion for an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, de&s;iring that the
Hou&s;e might have the peru&s;al of the li&s;ts tran&s;mitted from
the American colonies to the commi&s;&s;ioners for trade and
plantations, containing the names of all &s;uch per&s;ons
profe&s;&s;ing the Jewi&s;h religion as had entitled them&s;elves
to the benefit of the &s;aid act, &s;ince the year one thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and forty. The&s;e li&s;ts were accordingly
pre&s;ented, and left upon the table for the peru&s;al of the
members: but as this act contained no limitation of time
within which the benefit of it &s;hould be claimed, and as
this claim was attended with a good deal of trouble and
&s;ome expen&s;e, very few per&s;ons had availed them&s;elves of
it in that period. Neverthele&s;s, as a great number of
Jews were already entitled to claim this indulgence, and
as it remained an open channel through which Great-Britain
might be deluged with tho&s;e people, all of whom
the law would hold as natural-born &s;ubjects, and their
progeny as freed from all the re&s;trictions contained in the
act with re&s;pect to naturalized foreigners, Lord Harley
<PB N="358" REF="366">
moved for leave to bring in a bill to repeal &s;o much of the
&s;aid act as related to per&s;ons profe&s;&s;ing the Jewi&s;h reli|gion,
who &s;hould come to &s;ettle in any Briti&s;h colony
after a certain time. The motion was &s;econded by Sir
James Da&s;hwood, and &s;upported by the Earl of Egmont;
but being found unequal to the intere&s;t and elocution
of Mr. Pelham and Mr. P&mdash;, was rejected by the majo|rity.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. The next object that claimed the attention
of the Commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1754.</NOTE> was a bill for improving the regu|lations
already made to prevent the &s;preading of a conta|gious
di&s;temper, which raged among the horned cattle
in different parts of the kingdom. The la&s;t bill of this
&s;e&s;&s;ion that had the good fortune to &s;ucceed, was brought
in for puni&s;hing mutiny and de&s;ertion of officers and &s;ol|diers
in the &s;ervice of the Ea&s;t-India company, and for
the puni&s;hment of offences committed in the Ea&s;t-Indies
and the i&s;land of St. Helena. This being a mea&s;ure of a
very extraordinary nature, all the members were ordered
to attend the Hou&s;e on the day fixed for the &s;econd read|ing:
at the &s;ame time all charters, commi&s;&s;ions, and au|thorities,
by which any powers relative to a military ju|ri&s;diction,
or the exerci&s;e of martial law, had been
granted or derived from the crown to the &s;aid company,
were &s;ubmitted to the peru&s;al of the members. The
bill was by many con&s;idered as a dangerous exten&s;ion of
military power, to the prejudice of the civil rights en|joyed
by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and as &s;uch violently conte&s;ted
by the Earl of Egmont, Lord Strange, and Mr. Alder|man$Beckford.
Their objections were an&s;wered by the
Sollicitor-General and Mr. Yorke. The bill, after &s;ome
warm debates, being e&s;pou&s;ed by the mini&s;try, was enact|ed
into a law, and di&s;patched to the Ea&s;t-Indies by the
fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. Some other motions were made, and petitions
pre&s;ented on different &s;ubjects, which, as they mi&s;carried,
it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to particulari&s;e. It may not be
ami&s;s, however, to record an exemplary act of ju&s;tice
<PB N="359" REF="367">
done by the Commons on a per&s;on belonging to a pub|lick
office,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1754.</NOTE> whom they detected in the practice of fraud
and impo&s;ition. Notwith&s;tanding the particular care
taken in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, to prevent the monopolizing of
tickets in the &s;tate lottery, all tho&s;e precautions had been
eluded in a &s;candalous manner by certain individuals, en|tru&s;ted
with the charge of delivering the tickets to the
contributors, according to the intent of the act, which ex|pre&s;sly
declared that not more than twenty &s;hould be
&s;old to any one per&s;on. In&s;tead of conforming to the&s;e
directions of the legi&s;lature, they and their friends en|gro&s;&s;ed
great numbers, &s;heltering them&s;elves under a fal&s;e
li&s;t of feigned names for the purpo&s;e; by which means
they not only defeated the equitable intention of the Com|mons,
but in &s;ome mea&s;ure injured the publick credit;
ina&s;much as their avarice had prompted them to &s;ub&s;cribe
for a greater number than they had ca&s;h to purcha&s;e; &s;o
that there was a deficiency in the fir&s;t payment, which
might have had a bad effect on the public affairs. The&s;e
practices were &s;o flagrant and notorious as to attract the
notice of the Lower Hou&s;e, where an enquiry was begun,
and pro&s;ecuted with a &s;pirit of real patrioti&s;m, in oppo&s;i|tion
to a &s;candalous cabal, who endeavoured with equal
eagerne&s;s and per&s;everance to &s;creen the delinquents. All
their efforts, however, proved abortive; and a commit|tee
appointed to examine particulars, agreed to &s;everal
&s;evere re&s;olutions again&s;t one Le&mdash;, who had ama&s;&s;ed a
large fortune by this and other kinds of peculation. They
voted him guilty of breach of tru&s;t, and a direct violation
of the Lottery act; and an addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to his
Maje&s;ty, de&s;iring he might be pro&s;ecuted by the Attor|ney-General
for the&s;e offences. He was accordingly &s;ued
in the court of King's-Bench, and paid a fine of one
thou&s;and pounds, for having committed frauds by which
he had gained forty times that &s;um; but he was treated
with &s;uch gentlene&s;s as remarkably denoted the clemency
of that tribunal.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="368">
&sect; XIII. The &s;e&s;&s;ion ended in the beginning of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1754.</NOTE>
when the King gave the parliament to under&s;tand that he
&s;hould &s;ay nothing at pre&s;ent on foreign affairs; but a&s;|&s;ured
them of his fixed re&s;olution to exert his whole power
in maintaining the general tranquillity, and adhering to
&s;uch mea&s;ures for that purpo&s;e as he had hitherto pur|&s;ued
in conjunction with his allies. He in very affection|ate
terms thanked both Hou&s;es for the repeated proofs
they had given of their zealous attachment and loyalty to
his per&s;on and government. He enumerated the &s;alutary
mea&s;ures they had taken for le&s;&s;ening the national debt,
and augmenting the public credit, extending navigation
and commerce, reforming the morals of the people, and
improving the regulations of civil oeconomy. He con|cluded
with declaring, that he &s;ecurely relied upon the
loyalty and good affection of his people, and had no other
aim than their permanent happine&s;s. In a little time
after the clo&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion they were di&s;&s;olved by pro|clamation,
and new writs i&s;&s;ued by the Lord Chancellor
for convoking a new parliament. The &s;ame ceremonies
were practi&s;ed with re&s;pect to the convocations of Can|terbury
and York, though they no longer retained their
former importance; nor, indeed, were they &s;uffered to
&s;it and deliberate upon the &s;ubjects which formerly fell
under their cognizance and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. In the beginning of March, the mini&s;try of
Great-Britain had been left without a head by the death
of Mr. Pelham, which was not only &s;incerely lamented
by his &s;overeign, but al&s;o regretted by the nation in gene|ral,
to who&s;e affection he had powerfully recommended
him&s;elf by the candour and humanity of his conduct and
character, even while he pur&s;ued mea&s;ures which they
did not entirely approve. The lo&s;s of &s;uch a mini&s;ter
was the more deeply felt by the government at this junc|ture,
being the eve of a general election for a new par|liament,
when every admini&s;tration is &s;uppo&s;ed to exert
it&s;elf with redoubled vigilance and circum&s;pection. He
had already concerted the mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring a majority,
<PB N="361" REF="369">
and his plan was faithfully executed by his friends and
adherents, who &s;till engro&s;&s;ed the admini&s;tration. His bro|ther
the Duke of Newca&s;tle, was appointed fir&s;t lord
commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury, and &s;ucceeded as &s;ecretary
of &s;tate by Sir Thomas Robin&s;on, who had long re&s;ided as
amba&s;&s;ador at the court of Vienna. The other department
of this office was &s;till retained by the Earl of Holderne&s;&s;e,
and the function of chancellor of the Exchequer was per|formed
as u&s;ual by the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the King's-Bench,
until a proper per&s;on could be found to fill that
important office: but in the cour&s;e of the &s;ummer it was
be&s;towed upon Mr. Legge, who acquitted him&s;elf with
equal honour and capacity. Divers other alterations
were made, of le&s;s importance to the public. Sir George
Lyttelton was appointed cofferer, and the Earl of Hill&s;bo|rough
comptroller of the hou&s;ehold. Mr. George Gren|ville,
brother to Earl Temple, became trea&s;urer of the
Navy; and Mr. Charles Town&s;hend, of whom we &s;hall
have occa&s;ion to &s;peak in the &s;equel, took place as a com|mi&s;&s;ioner
at the board of Admiralty, in the room of Lord
Barrington, made ma&s;ter of the wardrobe. Lord Hard|wicke,
the chancellor, was promoted to the dignity of
an earl. The place of lord chief ju&s;tice of the King's-Bench
becoming vacant by the death of Sir William Lee,
was filled with Sir Dudley Ryder, and he was &s;ucceeded
by Mr. Murray in the office of Attorney-General.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. The election for the new parliament generally
&s;ucceeded according to the wi&s;h of the mini&s;try; for op|po&s;ition
was now dwindled down to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of
imbecility. It had received a mortal wound by the death
of the late Prince of Wales, who&s;e adherents were too wi&s;e
to pur&s;ue an <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> without any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s
or advantage. Some of them had prudently &s;ung their
palinodia to the mini&s;try, and been gratified with profit|able
employments; while others, &s;etting too great a price
upon their own importance, kept aloof till the market was
over, and were left to pine in &s;ecret over their di&s;appoint|ed
ambition. The maxims of Toryi&s;m had been relin|qui&s;hed
<PB N="362" REF="370">
by many, as the barren principles of a lo&s;ing game:
the body of the people were conciliated to the e&s;tabli&s;hed
government; and the harmony that now, for the fir&s;t
time, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among all the branches of the royal family
had a wonderful effect in acquiring a degree of popularity
which they had never before enjoyed. The writs being
returned, the new parliament was opened on the la&s;t day
of May by the Duke of Cumberland, and &s;ome other
peers, who acted by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion from his Ma|je&s;ty.
The Commons having cho&s;en for their &s;peaker the
Right Hon. Arthur Onflow, who had honourably filled
that high office in four preceding parliaments, he was
pre&s;ented and approved by the commi&s;&s;ioners. Then the
Lord High Chacellor harangued both Hou&s;es, giving
them to under&s;tand, that his Maje&s;ty had indulged them
with this early opportunity of coming together, in order
to complete without lo&s;s of time certain parliamentary
proceedings, which he judged would be for the &s;atisfaction
of his good &s;ubjects; but he did not think proper to lay
before them any points of general bu&s;ine&s;s, re&s;erving
every thing of that nature to the u&s;ual time of their a&s;&s;em|bling
in the winter. On the fifth day of June this &s;hort
&s;e&s;&s;ion was clo&s;ed, and the parliament prorogued by the
lords commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. In the beginning of this year violent di&s;|putes
aro&s;e between the government and the Hou&s;e of
Commons in Ireland, on the almo&s;t forgotten &s;ubjects
of privilege and prerogative. The Commons conceived
they had an undoubted right to apply the &s;urplus of their
revenue towards national purpo&s;es, without the con&s;ent of
their &s;overeign; and accordingly, in the year one thou|&s;and
&s;even hundred and forty-nine, prepared a bill with
this preamble: &startq;Whereas on the twenty-fifth day of
March la&s;t a con&s;iderable balance remained in the hands
of the vice trea&s;urers or receivers-general of the king|dom,
or their deputy or deputies, unapplied; and it
will be for your Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and for the ea&s;e of
your faithful &s;ubjects in this kingdom, that &s;o much
thereof as can be conveniently &s;pared &s;hould be paid,
<PB N="363" REF="371">
agreeably to your Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t gracious intentions,
in di&s;charge of part of the national debt.&endq; This ap|propriation
gave great offence to the advocates for prero|gative
in England, who affirmed that the Commons had
no right to apply any part of the unappropriated revenue,
nor even to take any &s;uch affair into con&s;ideration, with|out
the previous con&s;ent of the crown, expre&s;&s;ed in the
mo&s;t explicit terms. It was in con&s;equence of this doc|trine
that the Duke of Dor&s;et, lord-lieutenant of Ireland,
told them in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, held in the
year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-one, he was
commanded by the king to acquaint them, that his Ma|je&s;ty,
ever attentive to the ea&s;e and happine&s;s of his &s;ub|jects,
would graciou&s;ly con&s;ent, and recommended it
to them, that &s;uch a part of the money then remaining
in his trea&s;ury as &s;hould be thought con&s;i&s;tent with the
publick &s;ervice be applied towards the further reduction
of the national debt. This declaration alarmed the Com|mons,
zealous as they were for the pre&s;ervation of their
privileges; and in their addre&s;s of thanks, which, like
that of the parliament of Great-Britain, u&s;ed always to
eccho back the words of the &s;peech, they made no menti|on
of his Maje&s;ty's con&s;ent; but only acknowledged his
gracious attention to their ea&s;e and happine&s;s, in recom|mending
to them the application of the &s;urplus. They,
accordingly, re&s;olved to apply one hundred and twenty
thou&s;and pounds of that overplus towards a di&s;charge of
the national debts; and, in the preamble of the bill,
framed for this purpo&s;e, made no mention of his Maje&s;ty's
con&s;ent, though before they had acknowledged his goodne&s;s
in recommending this application. The mini&s;try in Eng|land
were highly offended at this purpo&s;ed omi&s;&s;ion, which
they con&s;trued into a wilful encroachment on the prero|gative;
and the bill was &s;ent back with an alteration in
the preamble, &s;ignifying his Maje&s;ty's con&s;ent as well as
recommendation. The Iri&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons being
at that time deeply engaged in a minute enquiry into the
conduct of a gentleman, a $ervant of the crown, and a
<PB N="364" REF="372">
member of their own Hou&s;e, accu&s;ed of having mi&s;applied
a large &s;um of money, with which he had been entru&s;ted,
for rebuilding or repairing the barracks, were now un|willing
to embroil them&s;elves farther with the government,
until this affair &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. They, therefore,
pa&s;&s;ed the bill with the alteration, and proceeded with
their enquiry. The per&s;on was convicted of having mi&s;|applied
the publick money, and ordered to make the bar|racks
fit for the reception and accommodation of the troops
at his own expen&s;e. They did not, however, neglect to
a&s;&s;ert what they thought their rights and privileges, when
the next opportunity occurred. The Duke of Dor&s;et,
when he opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of this year, repeated the ex|pre&s;&s;ion
of his Maje&s;ty's gracious con&s;ent, in mentioning
the &s;urplus of the publick money. They again omitted
that word in their addre&s;s; and re&s;olved, in their bill of
application, not only to &s;ink this odious term, but likewi&s;e
to abate in their complai&s;ance to the crown, by leaving
out that expre&s;&s;ion of grateful acknowledgement, which
had met with &s;uch a cold reception above. By this time
the conte&s;t had kindled up two violent factions, and diffu&s;ed
a general &s;pirit of re&s;entment through the whole Iri&s;h
nation. The committee who prepared the bill, in&s;tead of
in&s;erting the u&s;ual compliments in the preamble, men|tioned
nothing but a recital of facts, and &s;ent it over in a
very plain dre&s;s, quite de&s;titute of all embroidery. The
mini&s;try, intent upon vindicating the prerogative from
&s;uch an unmannerly attack, filled up the omi&s;&s;ions of the
committee, and &s;ent it back with this alteration: &startq;And
your Maje&s;ty, ever attentive to the ea&s;e and happine&s;s
of your faithful &s;ubjects, has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to
&s;ignify that you would con&s;ent, and to recommend it
to us, that &s;o much of the money remaining in your
Maje&s;ty's trea&s;ury as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary be applied to
the di&s;charge of the national debt, or &s;uch part thereof
as &s;hould be thought expedient by parliament.&endq; This,
then, being the cri&s;is which was to determine a con&s;titutional
point of &s;uch importance, namely, whether the people
<PB N="365" REF="373">
in parliament a&s;&s;embled have a right to deliberate upon,
and vote the application of any part of the unappropri|ated
revenue, without the previous con&s;ent of the crown;
tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t zealou&s;ly attached to the liberties
of their country re&s;olved to exert them&s;elves in oppo&s;ing
what they conceived to be a violation of tho&s;e liberties;
and the bill, with its alterations, was rejected by a majo|rity
of five voices. The &s;ucce&s;s of their endeavours was
celebrated with the mo&s;t extravagant rejoicings, as a tri|umph
of patrioti&s;m over the arts of mini&s;terial corruption;
and, on the other hand, all the &s;ervants of the crown
who had joined the popular cry on this occa&s;ion were in
a little time di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their employments. The re|jection
of the bill was a great di&s;appointment to the credi|tors
of the publick, and the circulation of ca&s;h was almo&s;t
&s;tagnated. The&s;e calamities were imputed to arbitrary
de&s;igns in the government; and the people began to be
inflamed with an enthu&s;ia&s;tick &s;pirit of independency,
which might have produced mi&s;chievous effects, had not
artful &s;teps been taken to bring over the demagogues, and
thus divert the &s;tream of popular clamour from the mini|&s;try
to tho&s;e very individuals who had been the idols of
popular veneration. The Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons
was promoted to the dignity of an earl; and &s;ome
other patriots were gratified with lucrative employments.
His Maje&s;ty's letter arrived for paying off &s;eventy-five thou|&s;and
five hundred pounds of the national debt. The cir|culation
was thus animated, and the re&s;entment of the
populace &s;ub&s;iding, the kingdom retrieved its former tran|quillity.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The ambition and intrigues of the French
court, by which the Briti&s;h intere&s;t was invaded and di|&s;turbed
on the continent of America, had al&s;o extended
it&s;elf to the Ea&s;t-Indies, where they endeavoured to em|broil
the Engli&s;h company with divers nabobs, or princes,
who governed different parts of the penin&s;ula intra Gangem.
That the reader may have a clear and di&s;tinct idea of the&s;e
tran&s;actions, we &s;hall exhibit a &s;hort &s;ketch of the Engli&s;h
<PB N="366" REF="374">
forts and &s;ettlements in that remote country. The fir&s;t
of the&s;e we &s;hall mention is Surat<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Several European nations had &s;ettlements at Surat, which was one of the mo&s;t frequented cities of the Ea&s;t, from the great concour&s;e of Maho|metan pilgrims, who make it their road from India, in their vi&s;its to the tomb of their prophet at Mecca. In order to keep the &s;eas clear of pirates between Surat and the gulf of Arabia and Per&s;ia, the Mogul had been at the annual expe&s;e of a large &s;hip fitted out on purpo&s;e to carry the pilgrims to Judda, which is within a &s;mall di&s;tance of Mecca. For the &s;ecurity of this &s;hip, as well as to protect the trade of Surat, he granted to his admiral, <HI>the &s;iddee,</HI> chief of a colony of caffrecs, or blacks, a revenue called the Tanka, to the value of three lacks of rupees, amounting to above thirty-&s;even thou&s;and pounds, ari&s;ing partly from the adjacent lands, and partly from the revenues of Surat, which were paid him yearly by the governor of the ca&s;tle, who is appointed by the Mogul to keep the city under proper &s;ubjection, without, however, interfering with the govern|ment of it.</NOTE>, in the province &s;o
called, &s;ituated between the twenty-fir&s;t and twenty-&s;econd
degrees of north latitude: from hence the penin&s;ula &s;tretches
into the Indian ocean, as far as the latitude of eight
north, ending in a point at Cape Comorin, which is the
&s;outhern extremity. To the northward this penin&s;ula
joins to Indo&s;tan, and at its greate&s;t breadth extends &s;even
hundred miles. Upon the we&s;t, ea&s;t, and &s;outh, it is
wa&s;hed by the &s;ea. It comprehends the kingdoms of Mala|bar,
Decan, Golconda, and Bi&s;nagar, with the princi|palities
of Gingi, Tanjaour, and Madura. The we&s;tern
&s;ide is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the Malabar coa&s;t:
the ea&s;tern takes the denomination of Coromandel; and
in different parts of this long &s;weep, from Surat round
Cape Comorin to the bottom of the bay of Bengal, the
Engli&s;h and other European powers have, with the con|&s;ent
of the Mogul, e&s;tabli&s;hed forts and trading &s;ettlements.
All the&s;e kingdoms, properly &s;peaking, belong to the
Mogul: but his power was &s;o weakened by the la&s;t inva|&s;ion
of Kouli Khan, that he has not been able to a&s;&s;ert his
empire over this remote country; the tributary princes of
which, and even the nabobs, who were originally gover|nors
appointed under their authority, have rendered them|&s;elves
independent, and exert an ab&s;olute dominion over
their re&s;pective territories, without acknowledging his
&s;uperiority either by tribute or homage. The&s;e princes,
<PB N="367" REF="375">
when they quarrel among them&s;elves, naturally have re|cour&s;e
to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch European powers as are
&s;ettled in or near their dominions; and in the &s;ame manner
the Ea&s;t-Indian companies of the European powers which
happen to be at war with each other never fail to intere&s;t
the nabobs in the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The next Engli&s;h &s;ettlement to Surat, on
the coa&s;t of the penin&s;ula, is Bombay, in the kingdom of
Decan, a &s;mall i&s;land, with a very convenient harbour,
about five-and-forty leagues to the &s;outh of Surat. The
town is very populous: but the &s;oil is barren, and the
climate unhealthy; and the commerce was rendered very
precarious by the neighbourhood of the famous Cor&s;air
Angria, until his port of Geriah was taken, and his forti|fications
demoli&s;hed. The Engli&s;h company likewi&s;e
carry on &s;ome traffick at Dabul, about forty leagues
farther to the &s;outh, in the province of Cuncan. In the
&s;ame &s;outherly progre&s;&s;ion, towards the point of the penin|&s;ula,
we arrive at Carwar, in the latitude of fifteen de|grees,
where there is a &s;mall fort and factory belonging
to the company, &s;tanding on the &s;outh &s;ide of a bay, with
a river capable of receiving &s;hips of pretty large burthen.
The climate here is remarkably &s;alubrious; the country
abounds with provi&s;ions of all &s;orts, and the be&s;t pepper
of India grows in this neighbourhood. The next Engli&s;h
&s;ettlement we find at Tillicherry, where the company has
erected a fort, to defend their commerce of pepper and
cardamoms from the in&s;ults of the Rajah, who governs this
part of Malabar. Hither the Engli&s;h trade was removed
from Calicut, a large town, that &s;tands fifteen leagues to
the &s;outhward of Tillicherry, and was as well frequented
as any port on the coa&s;t of the Indian penin&s;ula. The mo&s;t
&s;outherly &s;ettlement which the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;s on the Ma|labar
coa&s;t is that of Anjengo, between the eighth and ninth
degrees of latitude. It is defended by a regular fort,
&s;ituated on a broad river, which falls into the &s;ea, and would
be very commodious for trade, were not the water on the
$ar too &s;hallow to admit &s;hips of con&s;iderable burthen.
<PB N="368" REF="376">
Then turning the cape, and pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;trai$$$
of Chilao, formed by the i&s;land of Ceylon, we arrive o$
the coa&s;t of Coromandel, which forms the ea&s;tern &s;ide o$
the i&s;thmus. Pro&s;ecuting our cour&s;e in a northern direction
the fir&s;t Engli&s;h factory we reach is that of Fort St&punc;
David's, formerly called Tegapatan, &s;ituated in the lati|tude
of eleven degrees forty minutes north, within th$
kingdom of Gingi. It was, about &s;ix-and twenty-year
ago &s;old by a Mahratta prince to the Ea&s;t-India company
and, next to Bombay, is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable &s;ettlemen$
we have yet mentioned. Its territory extends about eight
miles along the coa&s;t, and half that &s;pace up the country
which is delightfully watered by a variety of rivers: th$
&s;oil is fertile, and the climate healthy. The fort is regu|lar,
well provided with cannon, ammunition, and $word$
numerous garri&s;on, which is the more nece&s;&s;ary, on accoun$
of the neighbourhood of the French &s;ettlement at Pondi|cherry<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The trade con&s;i&s;ts of long cloths of different colours, &s;allampo$$ mor$es, dimities, ginghams, and &s;uccatoons.</NOTE>. But the chief &s;ettlement belonging to the com|pany
on this coa&s;t is that of Madras, or Fort St. George
&s;tanding farther to the northward, between the thirteenth
and fourteenth degrees of latitude, and not a great way
from the diamond mines of Golconda. It is &s;eated on $word$
flat, barren, &s;corching &s;and, &s;o near the &s;ea, that, in bad
weather, the walls are endangered by the mighty &s;urge$
rolled in from the ocean. As the &s;oil is barren, the cli|mate
is &s;o inten&s;ely hot, that it would be altogether un$inhabitable,
were not the heat mitigated by the &s;ea-bree&s;es&punc;
On the land &s;ide it is defended by a &s;alt-water river, which
while it contributes to the &s;ecurity of the place, robs th$$
inhabitants of one great comfort, by ob&s;tructing th$
&s;prings of fre&s;h water. The fort is a regular &s;quare, th$
town &s;urrounded with walls well mounted with artillery
and the place, including the Black Town, is very popu|lous.
Madras, with &s;everal villages in the neighbourhood
was purcha&s;ed of the King of Golconda, before the Mo|gul
became &s;overeign of this country. The governor o$
this place is not only pre&s;ident of Fort St. George, but
<PB N="369" REF="377">
al&s;o of all the other &s;ettlements on the coa&s;ts of Malabar
and Coromandel, as far as the i&s;land of Sumatra. He lives
in great pomp, having inferior judges, who pa&s;s &s;entence of
death occa&s;ionally on malefactors of any nation, except
the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain. All the company's affairs
are directed by him and his council, who are inve&s;ted with
the power of inflicting corporal puni&s;hment, &s;hort of life
and member, upon &s;uch Europeans as are in the &s;ervice,
and di&s;po&s;e of all places of tru&s;t and profit. By virtue of
an act pa&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of this very &s;e&s;&s;ion, the mili|tary
officers belonging to the company were permitted to
hold courts-martial, and puni&s;h their &s;oldiers according
to the degree of their delinquency. In a word, Madras
is of the utmo&s;t importance to the company for its &s;trength,
wealth, and the great returns it makes in callicoes and
mu&s;lins. Towards the latter end of the la&s;t century the
Engli&s;h company had a flouri&s;hing factory at Ma&s;ulipatam,
&s;tanding on the north &s;ide of the river Nagundi, which
&s;eparates the provinces of Golconda and Bi&s;nagar, in the
latitude of &s;ixteen degrees and thirty minutes; but now
there is no European &s;ettlement here, except a Dutch
factory, maintained for carrying on the chintz commerce.
At Vi&s;igapatam, &s;ituated &s;till farther to the northward, the
Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;s a factory, regularly fortified, on the &s;ide
of a river which, however, a dangerous bar has rendered
unfit for navigation. The adjacent country affords cotton
cloths, and the be&s;t &s;triped mu&s;lins of India. It is chiefly
for the u&s;e of this &s;ettlement that the company maintains
a factory at Ganjam, the mo&s;t ea&s;tern town in the province
or kingdom of Golconda, &s;ituated in a country abounding
with rice and &s;ugar canes. Still farther to the north coa&s;t,
in the latitude of twenty-two degrees, the company main|tains
a factory at Bala&s;ore, which was formerly very con|&s;iderable;
but hath been of very little con&s;equence &s;ince
the navigation of the river Huguely was improved. At
this place every European &s;hip bound for Bengal and the
Ganges takes in a pilot. The climate is not counted very
&s;alubrious; but the adjacent country is fruitful to admi|ration,
and here are con&s;iderable manufactures of cotton
<PB N="370" REF="378">
and &s;ilk. Without &s;kilful pilots, the Engli&s;h would find
it very difficult to navigate the different channels through
which the river Ganges di&s;charges it&s;elf into the &s;ea at the
bottom of the bay of Bengal. On the &s;outhern branch is
a town called Pipely, where there was formerly an Engli&s;h
factory: but this was removed to Hunguel, one hundred
and &s;ixty miles farther up the river; a place which, to|gether
with the company's &s;ettlement at Calcutta, were
the emporiums of their commerce for the whole kingdom
of Bengal. Indeed Hunguely is now abandoned by the
Engli&s;h, and their whole trade centres at Calcutta or Fort
William, which is regular fortification, containing lodg|ings
for the factors and writers, &s;tore-hou&s;es for the com|pany's
merchandi&s;e, and magazines for their ammunition.
As for the governor's hou&s;e, which likewi&s;e &s;tands within
the fort, it is one of the mo&s;t regular &s;tructures in all India.
Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;ettlements along the &s;ea-coa&s;t of the penin|&s;ula,
and on the banks of the Ganges, the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India
company po&s;&s;e&s;s certain inland factories and po&s;ts for
the convenience and defence of their commerce, either
purcha&s;ed of the nabobs and rajahs, or conquered in the
cour&s;e of the war. As the operations we propo&s;e to record
were confined to the coa&s;ts of Malabar and Coromandel,
or the interior countries which form the penin&s;ula intra
Gangem, it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the factory at
Bencoolen, on the i&s;land of Sumatra, or any &s;ettlement
which the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;s in other parts of the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. In order to under&s;tand the military tran&s;actions
of the Engli&s;h company in India, the reader will take
notice, that immediately after the peace of Aix-la-Cha|pelle,
Mon&s;ieur Dupleix, who commanded for the French
in that country, began by his intrigues to &s;ow the &s;eeds
of di&s;&s;ention among the nabobs, that he might be the
better able to fi&s;h in troubled waters. Nizam Almuluck,
the Mogul's viceroy of Decan, having the right of nomi|nating
a governor of the Carnatick, now more generally
known by the name of the Nabob of Arcot, appointed
<PB N="371" REF="379">
Anaverdy Khan to that office, in the year one thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and forty-five. The viceroy dying was &s;uc|ceeded
in his viceroyalty, or &s;uba&s;hip, by his &s;econd &s;on
Nazirzing, whom the Mogul confirmed. He was oppo&s;ed
in his preten&s;ions by his own cou&s;in Muzapherzing, who
had recour&s;e to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of M. Dupleix, and obtained
from him a re-enforcement of Europeans and artillery, in
con&s;ideration of many pre&s;ents, and promi&s;es, which he
fulfilled in the &s;equel. Thus re-enforced, and joined by
one Chunda Saib, an active Indian chief, he took the field
again&s;t his kin&s;man Nazirzing, who was &s;upported by a
body of Engli&s;h troops under Colonel Laurence. The
French, dreading an engagement, retired in the night;
and Muzapherzing, &s;eeing him&s;elf abandoned by all his
own troops, appealed to the clemency of his cou&s;in, who
&s;pared his life, but detained him as a &s;tate pri&s;oner. In
this &s;ituation, he formed a con&s;piracy again&s;t his kin&s;man's
life, with Nazirzing's prime mini&s;ter, and the Nabobs of
Cadupab and Condaneor, then in his camp; and the con|&s;pirators
were encouraged in their &s;cheme by Dupleix and
Chunda Saib, who had retired to Pondicherry. Thus
&s;timulated, they murthered Nazirzing in his camp, and
proclaimed Muzapherzing viceroy of Decan. In the tents
of the murthered viceroy they found an immen&s;e trea&s;ure,
of which a great &s;hare fell to M. Dupleix, whom Mu|zapherzing
the u&s;urper at this time a&s;&s;ociated in the govern|ment.
By virtue of this a&s;&s;ociation the Frenchman
a&s;&s;umed the &s;tate and formalities of an ea&s;tern prince; and
he and his colleague Muzapherzing appointed Chunda
Saib Nabob of Arcot. Anaverdy Khan, the late nabob,
had been, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and
forty-nine, defeated and &s;lain by Muzapherzing and
Chunda Saib, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their French auxilia|ries;
and his &s;on Mahomed Ali Khan had put him&s;elf
under the protection of the Engli&s;h at Madras, and was
confirmed by Nazirzing, as his father's &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the
nabob&s;hip or government of Arcot. This government,
therefore, was di&s;puted between Mahommed Ali Khan,
<PB N="372" REF="380">
appointed by the legal viceroy Nazirzing, &s;upported by
the Engli&s;h company, and Chunda Saib, nominated by
the u&s;urper Muzapherzing, and protected by Dupleix,
who commanded at Pondicherry. Muzapherzing did not
long &s;urvive his u&s;urpation. In the year one thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and fifty-one, the &s;ame nabobs who had promoted
him to his kin&s;man's place, thinking them&s;elves ill rewarded
for their &s;ervice, fell upon him &s;uddenly, routed his troops,
and put him to death; and next day the chiefs of the
army proclaimed Sallabatzing, brother to Nazirzing,
viceroy of Decan: on the other hand, the Mogul ap|pointed
Gauzedy Khan, who was the elder brother of
Sallabatzing; and this prince confirmed Mahommed Ali
Khan in the government of Arcot; but the affairs of
the Mogul's court were then in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that he
could not &s;pare an army to &s;upport the nomination he ha$
made. Chunda Saib, Nabob of Arcot, having been de|po&s;ed
by the Great Mogul, who placed Anaverdy Khan in
his room, he re&s;olved to recover his government by force,
and had recour&s;e to the French general at Pondicherry,
who re-enforced him with two thou&s;and &s;epoys, or &s;oldiers
of the country, &s;ixty caffrees, and four hundred and twenty
French troops, on condition that, if he proved &s;ucce&s;sful$
in his enterprize, he &s;hould cede to the French the town
of Velur, in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry, with its
dependencies, con&s;i&s;ting of forty-five-villages. Thus re-enforced,
he defeated his rival Anaverdy Khan, who lo&s;$
his life in the engagement, re-a&s;&s;umed the government of
Arcot, and punctually performed the conditions which
had been &s;tipulated by his French allies.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. Mahommed Ali Khan, at the death of his fa|ther,
had fled to Tiruchirapalli<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Tiruchirapalli, commonly called Trichinopoly, &s;ituated near the river Ca$veri, above two hundred miles to the &s;outhward of Madras, is the ca|pital of a &s;mall kingdom belonging to the government of Arcot, and b$und|ed on the $a&s;t by the kingdom of Tanjore.</NOTE>, and &s;ollicited the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of the Engli&s;h, who favoured him with a re-enforce|ment
of money, men, and ammunition, under the conduct
<PB N="373" REF="381">
of Major Laurence, a brave and experienced officer. By
dint of this &s;upply, he gained &s;ome advantages over the
enemy, who were obliged to retreat; but no deci&s;ive blow
was given. Mahommed afterwards repaired in per&s;on to
Fort St. David's, to demand more powerful &s;uccours,
alledging that his fate was connected with the intere&s;t of
the Engli&s;h company, which in time would be obliged to
abandon the whole coa&s;t, &s;hould they allow the enemy to
proceed in their conque&s;ts. In con&s;equence of the&s;e re|pre&s;entations,
he received another &s;trong re-enforcement,
under the command of Captain Cope; but nothing of im|portance
was attempted, and the Engli&s;h auxiliaries retired.
Then Mahommed was attacked by the enemy, who ob|tained
a complete victory over him. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible
to maintain his footing by his own &s;trength, he entered
into a clo&s;e alliance with the Engli&s;h, and ceded to them
&s;ome commercial points, which had been long in di&s;pute.
Then they detached Captain Cope to put Tiruchirapalli
in a po&s;ture of defence; while Captain de Gingins, a Swi&s;s
officer, marched at the head of four hundred Europeans to
the nabob's a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The two armies being pretty equal
in &s;trength, lay encamped in &s;ight of each other a whole
month; during which nothing happened but a few &s;kir|mi&s;hes,
which generally terminated to the advantage of the
Engli&s;h auxiliaries. In order to make a diver&s;ion, and di|vide
the French forces, the company re&s;olved to &s;end a de|tachment
into the province of Arcot; and this was one of
the fir&s;t occa&s;ions upon which the extraordinary talents of
Mr. Clive were di&s;played. He had entered into the &s;er|vice
of the Ea&s;t-India company as a writer, and was con&s;i|dered
as a per&s;on very indifferently qualified for &s;ucceeding
in any civil &s;tation of life. He now offered his &s;ervice in a
military capacity, and actually began his march to Arcot,
at the head of two hundred and ten Europeans, with five
hundred &s;epoys<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The &s;epoys are mercenaries of the country, who are hired as &s;oldiers occa&s;ionally by all parties.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="382">
&sect; XXI. Such was the re&s;olution, &s;ecre&s;y, and di&s;patch
with which he conducted this enterpri&s;e, that the enemy
knew nothing of his motions until he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the capital, which he took without oppo&s;ition. The inha|bitants,
expecting to be plundered, offered him a large &s;um
to &s;pare their city; but they derived their &s;ecurity from
the genero&s;ity and di&s;cretion of the conqueror. He re|fu&s;ed
the proffered ran&s;om, and i&s;&s;ued a proclamation,
intimating, That tho&s;e who were willing to remain in
their hou&s;es &s;hould be protected from in&s;ult and injury,
and the re&s;t have leave to retire with all their effects, ex|cept
provi&s;ions, for which he promi&s;ed to pay the full va|lue.
By this &s;age conduct he conciliated the affections of
the people &s;o entirely, that even tho&s;e who quitted the place
&s;upplied him with exact intelligence of the enemy's de|&s;igns,
when he was be&s;ieged in the &s;equel. The town was
in a little time inve&s;ted by Raja Saib, &s;on of Chunda Saib,
at the head of a numerous army, and the operations of the
&s;iege were conducted by European engineers. Though
their approaches were retarded by the repeated and re&s;olute
&s;allies of Mr. Clive, they at length effected two breaches,
&s;uppo&s;ed to be practicable; and on the 14th day of Octo|ber,
in the year 1751, gave a general a&s;&s;ault. Mr. Clive,
having received intimation of their de&s;ign, had made &s;uch
preparations for their reception, that they were repul&s;ed
in every quarter with great lo&s;s, and obliged to rai&s;e the
&s;iege with the utmo&s;t precipitation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. This gallant Engli&s;hman, not contented with
the reputation he had acquired from his noble defence, was
no &s;ooner re-enforced by a detachment under Captain Kirk|patrick
from Trichinopoly, than he marched in pur&s;uit of
the enemy, whom he overtook in the plains of Arani.
There, on the third day of December, he attacked them
with irre&s;i&s;tible impetuo&s;ity; and, after an ob&s;tinate di&s;|pute,
obtained a complete victory at a very &s;mall expen&s;e.
The forts of Timery, Caujeveram, and Aranie, &s;urrendered
to the terror of his name, rather than to the force of his
arms; and he returned to Fort St. David's in triumph. He
<PB N="375" REF="383">
had enjoyed a very few weeks of repo&s;e, when he was &s;um|moned
to the field by fre&s;h incur&s;ions of the enemy. In
the beginning of the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and
fifty-two, he marched with a &s;mall detachment to Madras,
where he was joined by a re-enforcement from Bengal, the
whole number not exceeding three hundred Europeans,
and a&s;&s;embled a body of the natives, that he might have at
lea&s;t the appearance of an army. With the&s;e he proceed|ed
to Koveripauk, about fifteen miles from Arcot, where
he found the French and Indians, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen hun|dred
&s;epoys, &s;eventeen hundred hor&s;e, a body of natives,
and one hundred and fifty Europeans, with eight pieces of
cannon. Though they were advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted and
entrenched, and the day was already far advanced, Mr.
Clive advanced again&s;t them with his u&s;ual intrepidity;
but the victory remained for &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. It was
now dark, and the battle doubtful, when Mr. Clive &s;ent
round a detachment to fall on the rear of the French bat|tery.
This attack was executed with great re&s;olution,
while the Engli&s;h in front entered the entrenchments
with their bayonets fixed; and, though very little tinctured
with di&s;cipline, di&s;played the &s;pirit and activity of hardy
veterans. This double attack di&s;concerted the enemy in
&s;uch a manner, that they &s;oon de&s;i&s;ted from all oppo&s;ition.
A con&s;iderable carnage en&s;ued; yet the greater part of the
enemy, both hor&s;e and foot, &s;aved them&s;elves by flight,
under cover of the darkne&s;s. The French, to a man,
threw down their arms, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri|&s;oners
of war; and all the cannon and baggage fell into
the hands of the victor.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. The province of Arcot being thus cleared of
the enemy, Mr. Clive with his forces returned to Fort St.
David's, where he &s;ound Major Laurence ju&s;t arrived from
England<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Major Laurence had failed for England in the year 1750.</NOTE>, to take upon him the command of the troops in
the company's &s;ervice. On the eighteenth day of March
this officer, accompanied by Mr. Clive, took the field,
and was joined by Captain de Gingins at Tiruchirapalli.
<PB N="376" REF="384">
From hence he detached Mr. Clive, with four hundred
European &s;oldiers, a few Mahratta hor&s;e, and a body of
&s;epoys, to cut off the enemy's retreat to Pondicherry. In
the cour&s;e of this expedition he di&s;lodged a &s;trong body of
the foe po&s;ted at Samiaveram, and obliged Chunda Saib to
throw a body of troops into a &s;trong fortified temple, or
pagoda, upon the river Koleroon, which was immediately
inve&s;ted. The commanding officer, in attempting to
e&s;cape, was &s;lain with &s;ome others, and the re&s;t &s;urrendered
at di&s;cretion. They were &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another for|tified
temple, which he al&s;o be&s;ieged in form, and reduced
by capitulation. Having &s;ubdued the&s;e forts, he marched
directly to Volconda, whither he under&s;tood the French
commander D'Anteuil had retired. He found that officer
entrenched in a village, from whence he drove him with
precipitation, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the French can|non.
The enemy attempted to &s;ave them&s;elves in a neigh|bouring
fort; but the gates being &s;hut again&s;t them by the
governor, who was apprehen&s;ive that they would be follow|ed
pell-mell by the Engli&s;h, Mr. Clive attacked them
with great fury, and made a con&s;iderable &s;laughter: but his
humanity being &s;hocked at this carnage, he &s;ent a flag of
truce to the vanqui&s;hed, with terms of capitulation, which
they readily embraced. The&s;e articles imported, That
D'Anteuil, and three other officers, &s;hould remain pri&s;o|ners
on parole for one year; that the garri&s;on &s;hould be
exchanged, and the money and &s;tores be delivered to the
nabob whom the Engli&s;h &s;upported.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. During the&s;e tran&s;actions Chunda Saib lay
encamped with an army of thirty thou&s;and men at Syrin|ham,
an i&s;land in the neighbourhood of Tiruchirapalli,
which he longed eagerly to po&s;&s;es. Hither Major Lau|rence
marched with his Indian allies<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">His army con&s;i&s;ted of twelve hundred Europeans and Topa&s;&s;es in bat|talions, two thou&s;and &s;epoys; with the forces of the nabob, the Kings of Tanjore, Mui&s;&s;ack, and the Mahrattas; amounting to fifteen hundred hor&s;e and ten thou&s;and infantry. Topa&s;&s;es are de&s;cendants from the Portu|gue&s;e. The Mahrattas are native Indians of a very numerous and power|ful nation, which hath more than once given law to the Mogul.</NOTE>, and took his mea|&s;ures
<PB N="377" REF="385">
&s;o well, that the enemy's provi&s;ions were entirely in|tercepted.
Chunda Saib, in attempting to fly, was taken
pri&s;oner by the Nabob of Tanjore, an ally of the Engli&s;h
company, who ordered his head to be &s;truck off, in order
to prevent the di&s;putes which otherwi&s;e would have ari&s;en
among the captors<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Chunda Saib demanded leave of the Tanjore general to pa&s;s through his camp to Tanjore, and thi$ reque&s;t was granted; but, in&s;tead of being al|lowed to pa&s;s, he was detained pri&s;oner, and as the allies could not agree about the manner in which he &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of, &s;ome of the Tanjore officers, of their own accord, ended the di&s;pute, by cutting off his head.</NOTE>. The main body of the army being
attacked by Major Laurence, and totally defeated, the
i&s;land of Syrinham was &s;urrendered, and about a thou&s;and
European French &s;oldiers, under the command of Mr.
Law, nephew to the famous Law who &s;chemed the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ippi
company, fell into the hands of the conquerors,
including thirty officers, with forty pieces of cannon, and
ten mortars. M. Dupleix, though exceedingly mortified
by this di&s;a&s;ter, re&s;olved to maintain the cau&s;e which he
had e&s;pou&s;ed. He proclaimed Raja Saib, the &s;on of Chun|da
Saib, nabob of Arcot; and afterwards pretended that
he him&s;elf had received from the Mogul &s;anids or com|mi&s;&s;ions,
appointing him governor of all the Carnatick,
from the river Kri&s;tnah to the &s;ea: but the&s;e &s;anids appear|ed
in the &s;equel to be forged. In order to complete the
comedy, a &s;uppo&s;ed me&s;&s;enger from Delhi was received at
Pondicherry as amba&s;&s;ador from the Mogul. Dupleix,
mounted on an elephant, preceded by mu&s;ick and dancing
women, in the oriental manner, received in publick his
commi&s;&s;ion from the hands of the pretended amba&s;&s;ador.
He a&s;&s;ected the ea&s;tern &s;tate, kept his darbar or court, where
he appeared &s;itting cro&s;s-legged on a &s;opha, and received
pre&s;ents as prince of the country from his own council, as
well as from the natives. In the mean time, ho&s;tilities
continued between the forces of the two companies, as
auxiliaries to the contending nabobs. The Engli&s;h, under
Major Kinnier, made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon Gin|gee,
a &s;trong town &s;ituated to the we&s;t of Pondicherry.
Major Laurence defeated a &s;trong body of French and na|tives,

commanded by Dupleix's nephew, M. de Kerjean
in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry, and took him pri|&s;oner,
together with fifteen officers: after this &s;ucce&s;s, Mr.
Clive reduced the forts of Covelong and Chengalput, th$
la&s;t very &s;trong, &s;ituated about forty miles to the &s;outh$
ward of Madras. On the other hand, M. Dupleix inter|cepted
at &s;ea Captain Schaub, with his whole Swi&s;s compa|ny,
whom he detained pri&s;oners at Pondicherry, althoug$
the two nations were not at war with each other. Durin$
the&s;e tran&s;actions Sallabatzing, with a body of French un|der
M. de Bu&s;&s;y, advanced towards Aurengabad, which
was the &s;eat of government; but he was oppo&s;ed by $word$
chief of the Mahrattas, at the head of a numerous army. I$
the mean time, Gawzedy Khan, the elder brother of Sal|labatzing,
whom the Mogul had appointed viceroy of De$can, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his government at Aurengabad
where, in fourteen days after his arrival, he was poi&s;one$
by his own &s;i&s;ter. The Mogul immediately appointed hi$
&s;on Schah Abadin Khan to &s;ucceed his father; and thi$
prince actually rai&s;ed an army to come and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion$
but the Mogul's affairs requiring his pre&s;ence at Delhi, h$
was obliged to po&s;tpone his de&s;ign, &s;o that Sallabatzing wa$
left without a competitor, and made a pre&s;ent to the Frenc$
of all the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements to the northward. Thu$
concluded the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty
two. Next campaign was chiefly confined to the neigh|bourhood
of Trichinopoly, where Major Laurence mad$
&s;everal vigorous attacks upon the enemy's army, and ob|tained
many advantages, which, however, did not prov$
deci&s;ive, becau&s;e he was &s;o much out-numbered that h$
could never follow his blow.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. In the cour&s;e of this year, the Mogul was de|po&s;ed
by his general Schah Abadin Khan, the viceroy o$
Decan, who rai&s;ed to the throne Allum Geer, another
prince of the blood. In the &s;ucceeding year, a negocia|tion
was &s;et on foot by Mr. Saunders, governor of Ma|dras,
and M. Dupleix, and conferences were opened a
Sadra&s;s, a Dutch &s;ettlement between Pondicherry and For
<PB N="379" REF="387">
St. George: but this proved abortive; and many other
gallant efforts were made by Major Laurence in the terri|tory
of Trichinopoly, which &s;till continued to be the &s;cene
of action. In the cour&s;e of this year Admiral Wat&s;on ar|rived
on the coa&s;t of Coromandel with a &s;quadron of &s;hips
of war, having on board a regiment commanded by Colonel
Aldercroon: at the &s;ame time the &s;hips from France
brought over to Pondicherry the Sieur Godeheu, com|mi&s;&s;ary
general and governor-general of all their &s;ettle|ments,
at who&s;e arrival Dupleix departed for Europe. The
new governor immediately wrote a letter to Mr. Saunders,
profe&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t pacifick inclinations, and propo&s;ing a
&s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms between the two companies, until their
di&s;putes could be amicably adju&s;ted. This propo&s;al was
very agreeable to the governor and council at Madras, and
a ce&s;&s;ation of arms actually took place in the month of
October, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-four.
Deputies being &s;ent to Pondicherry, a provi&s;ional
treaty and truce were concluded, on condition that neither
of the two companies &s;hould for the future interfere in
any difference that might ri&s;e between the princes of the
country. The other articles related to the places and &s;et|tlements
that &s;hould be retained or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the re|&s;pective
companies, until fre&s;h orders relating to this
agreement &s;hould arrive from the courts of London and
Ver&s;ailles, tran&s;mitted by the two Ea&s;t-India companies
of France and England. Until &s;uch orders &s;hould arrive,
it was &s;tipulated that neither nation &s;hould be allowed to
procure any new grant or ce&s;&s;ion, or to build $orts for the
defence of new e&s;tabli&s;hments; and that they &s;hould not
proceed to any ce&s;&s;ion, retroce&s;&s;ion, or evacuation of
what they then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; but every thing &s;hould remain
on the footing of <HI>uti po&s;&s;idetis.</HI> How pacifick &s;oever the
&s;entiments of the French &s;ubjects might have been at this
period in the Ea&s;t-Indies, certain it is, the de&s;igns of the
French governors in America were altogether ho&s;tile, and
their conduct ha&s;tening towards a rupture, which kindled
up a bloody war in every divi&s;ion of the globe.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="388">
&sect; XXVI. As this war may be termed a native of Ame|rica,
and the principal &s;cenes of it were acted on that con|tinent,
we &s;hall, for the information of the reader, &s;ketch
out the &s;ituation of the then Briti&s;h colonies as they border|ed
on each other, and extended along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, from
the gulf of St. Laurence as far &s;outh as the country
of Florida. We &s;hall enumerate the Indian nations that
lie &s;cattered about their confines, and delineate the man|ner
in which the French hemmed them in by a &s;urpri&s;ing
line of fortifications. Should we comprehend Hud&s;on's-Bay,
with the adjacent countries, and the banks of New-foundland,
in this geographical detail, we might affirm
that Great-Britain at that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a territory along
the &s;ea-coa&s;t, extending &s;eventeen hundred miles in a direct
line, from the &s;ixtieth to the thirty-fir&s;t degree of northern
latitude: but as the&s;e two countries were not concerned
in this di&s;pute, we &s;hall advance from the northward to the
&s;outhern &s;ide of the gulf of St. Laurence; and beginning
with Acadia or Nova-Scotia, de&s;cribe our &s;ettlements, as
they lie in a &s;outherly direction, as far as the gulf of Flo|rida.
This great tract of country, &s;tretching fifteen degrees
of latitude, is wa&s;hed on the ea&s;t by the Atlantick ocean:
the &s;outhern boundary is Spani&s;h Florida; but to the we&s;t|ward
the limits are uncertain, &s;ome affirming that the ju|ri&s;diction
of the colonies penetrates through the whole con|tinent,
as far as the South-Sea; while others, with more
moderation, think they are naturally bounded by the river
Illionois that runs into the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and in a manner con|nects
that river with the chain of lakes known by the
names of Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, the three
fir&s;t communicating with each other, and the la&s;t di&s;|charging
it&s;elf into the river St. Laurence, which running
by Montreal and Quebeck i&s;&s;ues into the bay of the &s;ame
denomination, forming the northern boundary of Nova-Scotia.
The French, who had no legal claim to any
lands on the &s;outh &s;ide of this river, neverthele&s;s, with an
in&s;olence of ambition peculiar to them&s;elves, not only ex|tended
their forts from the &s;ource of the St. Laurence,
<PB N="381" REF="389">
through an immen&s;e tract of country, as far as the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ippi,
which di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the gulf of Florida;
but al&s;o, by a &s;eries of unparalleled encroachments, endea|voured
to contract the Engli&s;h colonies within &s;uch nar|row
limits as would have cut off almo&s;t one half of their
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. As we have already given a geographical de|&s;cription
of Nova-Scotia, and mentioned the particulars of
the new &s;ettlement of Halifax, we &s;hall now only ob&s;erve,
that it is &s;urrounded on three &s;ides by the &s;ea, the gulf, and
river of St. Laurance; that its original boundary to the
we&s;t was the river Pentagoet; but it is now contracted
within the river St. Croix, becau&s;e the crown of Great-Britain
did, in the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-three,
grant to the Duke of York the territory of Sagada|hack,
&s;tretching from St. Croix to the river of this name;
which was in the &s;equel, by an expre&s;s charter from the
crown, annexed to the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay,
one of the four governments of New-England. This
country, &s;ituated next to Nova-Scotia, lies between the
forty-fir&s;t and forty-fifth degrees of north latitude, extend|ing
near three hundred miles in length, and about two hun|dred
in breadth, if we bound it by tho&s;e tracts which the
French po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: no part of the &s;ettlements of this country,
however, &s;tretches above &s;ixty miles from the &s;ea. The
&s;ummer is here inten&s;ely hot, and the winter proportion|ably
&s;evere: neverthele&s;s, the climate is healthy, and the
&s;ky generally &s;erene. The &s;oil is not favourable to any of
the European kinds of grain; but produces great plenty of
maiz, which the people bake into bread, and brew into
beer, though their favourite drink is made of mela&s;&s;es hop|ped,
and impregnated with the tops of the &s;pruce-fir, which
is a native of this country. The ground rai&s;es good flax
and tolerable hemp. Here are great herds of black cattle,
&s;ome of them very large in &s;ize, a va&s;t number of excellent
hogs, a breeds of &s;mall hor&s;es, graceful, &s;wift, and hardy;
and large flocks of &s;heep, who&s;e wool, though not &s;o fine
as that of England, is manufactured with great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="390">
&sect; XXVII. New-England is compo&s;ed of the four pro|vinces
known by the names of New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;ach$
&s;ett's-Bay, Rhode-I&s;land, and Connecticut. It is bound|ed
on the &s;outh by New-York, extending northerly, o$
both &s;ides of the river Hud&s;on, about two hundred mile
into the country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Indians of the Five Na|tions,
whom the French di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of th$
Irroquois; but in breadth this province does not exceed
fifty miles, though it comprehends Long-I&s;land, lying to
the &s;outhward of Connecticut. The capital, which derive
from the province the name of New-York, is &s;ituated o$
an excellent harbour in the $&s;land of Manahatton, extend|ing
fourteen miles in length, and five in breadth, at the
mouth of the noble river Hud&s;on, which is navigable for
above two hundred miles. At the di&s;tance of one hundred
and fifty miles from New-York &s;tands the town of Albany,
upon the &s;ame river. In this place all the treaties and
other tran&s;actions are negociated between the Engli&s;h and
the Irroquois, a confederacy of five Indian nations, who,
by their union, courage, and military &s;kill, had reduced a
great number of other Indian tribes, and &s;ubdued a terri|tory
more exten&s;ive than the whole kingdom of France.
They were about four&s;core years ago able to bring ten
thou&s;and warriors into the field; but now their number is &s;o
greatly dimini&s;hed by wars, epidemical di&s;ea&s;es, and the u&s;e
of &s;pirituous liquors, that they cannot rai&s;e above fifteen
hundred men, even though they have admitted into their
confederacy the nation of the Tu&s;caroras, whom the Eng|li&s;h
drove from the confines of Carolina. The Mohok
Indians inhabit the country advanced from Albany. The
northern extremities of New-Hamp&s;hire and New-York are
divided by the lakes Champlain and Sacrament, between
which the French had rai&s;ed the fort of Crown-Point.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. Contiguous to New-York, and lying along
the coa&s;t, in a &s;outherly direction, is the &s;mall province of
New-Jer&s;ey, bounded on the we&s;t by the river Delaware,
which divides it from Penn&s;ylvania, extending about
one hundred and fifty miles in length, but in breadth not
<PB N="383" REF="391">
more than one third part of that extent. The climate, &s;oil
and produce of the&s;e two provinces, as well as of Penn|&s;ylvania,
are &s;imilar. They yield great quantities of grain,
&s;heep, hor&s;es, hogs, and horned cattle; all kinds of poul|try
and game in great abundance; vegetables of every
&s;ort in perfection, and excellent fruit, particularly peaches
and melons. Their va&s;t fore&s;ts abound with oak, a&s;h,
$eech, che&s;nut, cedar, walnut-tree, cypre&s;s, hickery, &s;a&s;&s;|$ras,
and pine; but the timber is not counted &s;o fit for
&s;hipping as that of New-England and Nova-Scotia. The&s;e
provinces produce great quantities of flax and hemp.
Ne-York affords mines of iron, and very rich copper
ore is found in New-Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. Penn&s;ylvania, lying to the &s;outhward of New-York
and New-Jer&s;ey, is bounded on the other &s;ide by
Maryland, &s;tretching two hundred and fifty miles in length,
two hundred in breadth, and having no communication
with the &s;ea, except by the mouth of the river Delaware.
This province was originally &s;ettled by quakers, under the
au&s;pices of the celebrated William Penn, who&s;e de&s;cen|dants
are &s;till proprietaries of the country. Philadel|phia,
the capital, &s;tands on a tongue of land, at the con|fluence
of two navigable rivers, the Delaware and the
Schulkel, di&s;po&s;ed in the form of a regular oblong, and
de&s;igned by the original plan to extend from the one to
the other. The &s;treets, which are broad, &s;pacious, and
uniform, cro&s;s each other at right angles, leaving proper
&s;paces for churches, markets, and other publick edifices.
The hou&s;es are neatly built of brick, the quays &s;pacious
and magnificent, the warehou&s;es large and numerous, and
the docks commodious and well contrived for &s;hip-building.
Penn&s;ylvania is under&s;tood to extend as far northerly as
the banks of the lake Erie, where the French erected a fort.
They al&s;o rai&s;ed another at &s;ome di&s;tance to the &s;outh|ward
of the Riviere-au-Beuf, and made other encroach|ments
on this colony.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. Adjoining to part of Penn&s;ylvania, on the &s;ea
coa&s;t, lies the province of Maryland, a tract of land &s;ituated
<PB N="384" REF="392">
along the bay of Che&s;apeak, in length about one hundred
and forty miles, and nearly of the &s;ame breadth, bounded
on the north by Penn&s;ylvania, on the ea&s;t by the Atlantick
ocean, and by the river Potowmack on the &s;outh. This
country was fir&s;t planted with Roman catholicks by Lord
Baltimore, to whom Charles II. granted it by patent. In
the &s;equel, however, people of all religions were admitted
into this &s;ettlement, and indulged with liberty of con&s;cience,
and at pre&s;ent the reigning religion is that of the Engli&s;h
church. The climate is very &s;ultry in &s;ummer, and not
very &s;alubrious. The &s;oil is fruitful, and produces a great
quantity of tobacco, which the people cultivate as their
&s;taple commodity. The &s;eat of government is e&s;tabli&s;hed
at Annapolis, a &s;mall town beautifully &s;ituated on the river
Patuxent.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. Tracing the &s;ea-coa&s;t &s;till &s;outherly, the next
&s;ettlement is Virginia, watered on the north by the river
Potowmack, which is the boundary between this and the
colony la&s;t de&s;cribed, having the bay of Che&s;apeak to the
ea&s;t, bounded on the &s;outh by Carolina, and extending
we&s;tward without any pre&s;cribed limits, though the planta|tions
have reached no farther than the great Allegany
mountains; &s;o that the province, as now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;tretches
in length about two hundred and forty miles, and in breadth
not above two hundred, lying between the fifty-fifth and
fortieth degrees of latitude. In &s;ailing to Virginia, naviga|tors
&s;teer through a &s;traight formed by two points, called
the Capes, into the bay of Che&s;apeak, a large inlet that
runs three hundred miles into the country from &s;outh to
north, covered from the Atlantick ocean by the ea&s;tern
&s;ide of Maryland, and a &s;mall portion of Virginia on the
&s;ame penin&s;ula. This noble bay is about eighteen miles
broad for a con&s;iderable &s;pace, and &s;even at its narrowe&s;t
part, yielding generally nine fathoms depth of water; on
both &s;ides it receives many navigable rivers, tho&s;e on the
Virginia &s;ide being known by the names of James-river,
York-river, the Rappahannock, and Potowmack. This
country, e&s;pecially towards the &s;ea, lies very low and &s;wampy,
<PB N="385" REF="393">
and the &s;oil is extremely fertile. The air and weather
are variable, the heats of &s;ummer exce&s;&s;ive, the fro&s;ts of
winter &s;udden, and inten&s;ely cold; &s;o that, upon the whole,
the climate is neither very agreeable nor healthy, the peo|ple
being particularly &s;ubject to agues and pleuretick di&s;|orders.
The province abounds with va&s;t fore&s;ts of timber:
the plains are covered with a &s;urpri&s;ing luxuriancy of ve|getables,
flowers, and flowering &s;hrubs, diffu&s;ing the mo&s;t
delicious fragrance. The ground yields plenty of corn,
and every &s;ort of fruit in great abundance and perfection.
Horned cattle and hogs have here multiplied to admiration
&s;ince they were fir&s;t imported from Europe. The animals,
natives of this and the neighbouring countries, are deer,
panthers or tigers, bears, wolves, foxes, &s;quirrels, racoons,
and creatures called opo&s;&s;ums, with an infinite variety of
beautiful birds, and a diver&s;ity of &s;erpents, among which
the rattle&s;nake is the mo&s;t remarkable.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. Virginia is bounded to the &s;outh by the two
Carolinas, &s;ituated between the forty-&s;ixth and thirty-fir&s;t
degrees of latitude; the length amounting to upwards
of four hundred miles, and the breadth extending near
three hundred, as far as the Indian nations called the Ca|tawbas,
the Creeks, and Cherokees. The country of
Carolina is divided into two governments, of which the
mo&s;t northern is the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable. The climate in
both is the &s;ame, as well as the &s;oil: the fir&s;t is warm,
though not unhealthy; the la&s;t extremely fertile, yielding
every thing in plenty which is produced in Virginia, be|&s;ides
abundance of excellent oranges, and &s;ome commodi|ties
which are not found to the northward. North Caro|lina,
though not &s;o opulent, is more populous than the
&s;outhern part. The coloni&s;ts of North-Carolina carry on
a con&s;iderable traffick in tar, pitch, turpentine, &s;taves,
&s;hingles, lumber, corn, peas, pork, and beef, tobacco,
deer-&s;kins, indigo, wheat, rice, bees-wax, tallow, bacon,
and hog's lard, cotton, and &s;quared timber, live cattle,
with the &s;kins of beaver, racoon, fox, minx, wild cat, and
otter. South-Carolina is much better cultivated; the
<PB N="386" REF="394">
people are more civilized, and the commerce more impor|tant.
The capital of this province, called Charles-Town,
is finely &s;ituated at the confluence of two navigable rivers,
having the advantage of a commodious harbour. Their
trade, exclu&s;ive of the articles we have already mentioned
as common to this government and that of North-Caro|lina,
con&s;i&s;ts of two chief &s;taple commodities, rice and in|digo,
which they cultivate with great &s;ucce&s;s; and they
have likewi&s;e made &s;ome progre&s;s in the culture of &s;ilk.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. The mo&s;t &s;outhern of all our &s;ettlements
on this coa&s;t is Georgia, extending about &s;ixty miles from
north to &s;outh, along the &s;ea-&s;hore; but widening in the
inland parts to above one hundred and fifty, and &s;tretching
almo&s;t three hundred from the &s;ea to the Apalachian moun|tains.
This country differs very little from that of South-Carolina,
with which it borders; yet the &s;ummer is here
more hot, and the &s;oil not &s;o fertile. Savannah, the capi|tal,
&s;tands commodiou&s;ly for trade, about ten miles from
the &s;ea, on a river of the &s;ame name, navigable with large
boats two hundred miles farther up to the &s;econd town,
called Augu&s;ta, a place that flouri&s;hes by the Indian trade
of &s;kins, which the inhabitants carry on with their neigh|bours
the Creeks, the Chicke&s;aws, and the Cherokees,
who are the mo&s;t numerous and powerful tribes in America.
Georgia is bounded on the &s;outh by the river A$$amaha,
at no great di&s;tance from the Spani&s;h fort of St. Augu&s;tin.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. Having thus exhibited a &s;uccinct view of the
Briti&s;h colonies in North-America, for the information of
the reader, we &s;hall now re&s;ume the thread of our hi&s;tory,
and particulari&s;e the tran&s;actions by which the pre&s;ent year
was di&s;tingui&s;hed on this exten&s;ive continent. The go|vernment
of England having received nothing but eva&s;ive
an&s;wers from the court of France, touching the complaints
that were made of the encroachments in America, di&s;patched
orders to all the governors of that country to repel force by
force, and drive the French from their &s;ettlements on the
river Ohio. Accordingly, the provinces of Virginia and
Penn&s;ylvania took this important affair into their con&s;ider|ation;
<PB N="387" REF="395">
but, while they deliberated, the French vigorou&s;ly
pro&s;ecuted their de&s;igns on the other &s;ide of the mountains.
They &s;urpri&s;ed Logs-town, which the Virginians had
built upon the Ohio; made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the
Block-hou&s;e and Truck-hou&s;e, where they found &s;kins
and other commodities to the amount of twenty thou&s;and
pounds, and de&s;troyed all the Briti&s;h traders, except two
who found means to e&s;cape. At the &s;ame time, M. de
Contrecoeur, with a thou&s;and men, and eighteen pieces of
cannon, arrived in three hundred canoes from Venango, a
fort they had rai&s;ed on the banks of the Ohio, and reduced
by &s;urpri&s;e a Briti&s;h fort which the Virginians had built
on the forks of the Monangahela, that runs into the &s;ame
river.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. The&s;e ho&s;tilities were followed by divers
&s;kirmi&s;hes between the people of the two nations, which
were fought with various &s;ucce&s;s. At length the govern|nors
of the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements received orders from En|gland
to form a political confederacy, for their mutual
defence: and the governor of New-York was directed to
confer with the chiefs of the Six Nations, with a view to
detach them from the French intere&s;t by dint of promi&s;es
and pre&s;ents of value, &s;ent over for that purpo&s;e. A con|gre&s;s
was accordingly appointed at Albany, to which
place the governor of New-York repaired, accompanied
by commi&s;&s;ioners from all the other Briti&s;h &s;ettlements:
but a very &s;mall number of Indians arrived, and even the&s;e
&s;eemed to be indifferent to the advances and exhortations
that were made by the Engli&s;h orator. The truth is, the
French had artfully weaned them from their attachment to
the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain. Neverthele&s;s, they accept|ed
the pre&s;ents, renewed their treaties with the King of
England, and even demanded his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in driving the
French from the po&s;ts and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions they had u&s;urped
within the Indian territories. It was in con&s;equence of
the mea&s;ures here taken, that Colonel Wa&s;hington was de|tached
from Virginia with four hundred men, and occu|pied
a po&s;t on the banks of the river Ohio, where he
<PB N="388" REF="396">
threw up &s;ome works, and erected a kind of occa&s;ional
fort, in hopes of being able to defend him&s;elf in that &s;itu|ation,
until he &s;hould be joined by a re-enforcement from
New-York, which, however, did not arrive.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. While he remained in this &s;ituation, De
Viller, a French commander, at the head of nine hun|dred
men, being on his march to di&s;lodge Wa&s;hington,
detached one Jamonville, an inferior officer, with a &s;mall
party, and a formal &s;ummons to Colonel Wa&s;hington,
requiring him to quit the fort, which he pretended was
built on ground belonging to the French, or their allies.
So little regard was paid to this intimation, that the Eng|li&s;h
fell upon this party, and, as the French affirm,
without the lea&s;t provocation, either &s;lew or took the whole
detachment. De Viller, incen&s;ed at the&s;e unprovoked
ho&s;tilities, marched up to the attack, which Wa&s;hington
for &s;ome time &s;u&s;tained under manifold di&s;advantages. At
length, however, he &s;urrendered the fort upon capitulation,
for the performance of which he left two officers as ho&s;tages
in the hands of the French; and in his retreat was terri|bly
harra&s;&s;ed by the Indians, who plundered his baggage,
and ma&s;&s;acred his people. This event was no &s;ooner
known in England, than the Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Paris
received directions to complain of it to the French mini|&s;try,
as an open violation of the peace; but this repre|&s;entation
had no effect.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. Both nations by this time fore&s;aw that a
rupture would be inevitable, and each re&s;olved to make
&s;uitable preparations. France continued to &s;end re-en|forcements
of men, and &s;upplies of ammunition to Que|beck,
for the pro&s;ecution of her ambitious projects; and
the mini&s;try of Great-Britain tran&s;mitted &s;alutary cautions
to the governors of the provinces in North-America, ex|horting
them to join their endeavours for repelling the in|cur&s;ions
of the enemy. Such an union as &s;eemed nece&s;|&s;ary
for their common pre&s;ervation was not ea&s;ily effected.
The different colonies were divided by different views and
intere&s;ts, both religious and political: be&s;ides, every &s;et|tlement
<PB N="389" REF="397">
was di&s;tracted into factions, formed by the gover|nor
and the demagogues of the a&s;&s;embly: in other words,
an oppo&s;ition like that in parliament, and a continual
&s;truggle between the liberties of the people and the prero|gative
of the proprietor, whether &s;overeign or &s;ubject.
Mr. Dinwiddie, governor of Virginia, having demanded
a certain perqui&s;ite or fee for every patent he &s;hould pa&s;s
for land, the a&s;&s;embly voted his demand illegal, arbitrary,
and oppre&s;&s;ive. They declared, that every man who paid
it &s;hould be deemed an enemy to his country, and &s;ent
over an agent to London, to &s;ollicit the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of this
impo&s;ition. The repre&s;entatives of the people in Penn&s;yl|vania
wa&s;ted the time in vain deliberations and violent di&s;|putes
with their proprietaries, while the enemy infe&s;ted
their frontiers. The colony of New-York was filled with
di&s;content and animo&s;ity. Sir Danvers O&s;born, who had
been appointed governor of this province, died immediately
after his arrival at New-York, and the in&s;tructions he had
received were expo&s;ed to publick cen&s;ure. The preamble
inveighed &s;everely again&s;t the want of duty, allegiance,
loyalty, and unanimity which had lately appeared &s;o
notorious in the a&s;&s;embly of that province, who had vio|lated
the royal commi&s;&s;ion and in&s;tructions, by a&s;&s;uming
to them&s;elves the power to di&s;po&s;e of publick money in the
laws which they had occa&s;ionally pa&s;&s;ed. This gentle|man
was, therefore, directed to in&s;i&s;t upon the reformation
of all tho&s;e publick abu&s;es, and upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
a certain &s;upply for the &s;ervice of the government, as well
as upon the &s;ettlement of a &s;alary for him&s;elf. Moreover,
his Maje&s;ty, in the&s;e in&s;tructions, &s;ignified his will and
plea&s;ure, That all money rai&s;ed for the &s;upply and &s;upport
of government, or upon any emergency for immediate
&s;ervice, &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of and applied properly to the
u&s;e for which it might be granted, by warrant from the
governor, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the coun|cil
of the province, and no otherwi&s;e: That, neverthe|le&s;s,
the a&s;&s;embly &s;hould be permitted, from time to time,
to view and examine the accounts of money di&s;po&s;ed of, by
<PB N="390" REF="398">
virtue of laws which they had enacted: That if any
member of the council, or officer holding place of tru&s;t or
profit within the government, &s;hould, in any manner
whatever, give his a&s;&s;ent to, or in any wi&s;e advi&s;e or con|cur
with the a&s;&s;embly in pa&s;&s;ing any act or vote, whereby
the royal prerogative might be le&s;&s;ened or impaired, or any
money be rai&s;ed or di&s;po&s;ed of for the publick &s;ervice, con|trary
to or incon&s;i&s;tent with the method pre&s;cribed by
the&s;e in&s;tructions, the governor &s;hould forthwith remove
or &s;u&s;pend &s;uch coun&s;ellor or officer &s;o offending, and give
an immediate account of his proceedings to the commi&s;&s;ion|ers
of trade and plantations. The&s;e were peremptory in|junctions,
which plainly proved that the mini&s;try was de|termined
to &s;upport the prerogative with a high hand;
but it mu&s;t be owned, at the &s;ame time, that abundance of
provocation had been given, by the in&s;olent oppo&s;ition of
&s;ome turbulent individuals, who had exerted all their in|fluence
in di&s;turbing and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the views and de&s;igns
of the government. While the Briti&s;h colonies in Ame|rica
were, by the&s;e divi&s;ions, in a great mea&s;ure di&s;abled
from making vigorous efforts again&s;t the common enemy,
the admini&s;tration at home began to exert it &s;elf for their
defence. Officers were appointed for two regiments, con|&s;i&s;ting
of two battalions each, to be rai&s;ed in America,
and commanded by Sir William Pepperel and Governor
Shirley, who had enjoyed the &s;ame command in the la&s;t
war; and a body of troops was de&s;tined for the &s;ame &s;er|vice.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The mo&s;t remarkable incident that mark|ed
this year on the continent of Europe was the conver|&s;ion
of the Hereditary Prince of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, who had
e&s;pou&s;ed the Prince&s;s Mary of England. He now de|clared
him&s;elf a Roman Catholick, and was &s;uppo&s;ed to
have been cajoled to this profe&s;&s;ion by the promi&s;es of cer|tain
powers, who flattered his ambition, in order to weak|en
the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Germany. His father,
though deeply affected by his &s;on's apo&s;tacy, did not &s;ail to
take immediate mea&s;ures for preventing the evil con&s;equences
<PB N="391" REF="399">
which might otherwi&s;e have flowed from his defection.
He forthwith a&s;&s;embled the &s;tates of the landgraviate, in
order to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as might appear nece&s;&s;ary to
maintain the religion, laws, and con&s;titution of the coun|try;
and the prince was laid under certain re&s;trictions,
which he did not find it an ea&s;y talk to &s;et a&s;ide. It was
enacted, that when the regency &s;hould devolve to him by
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion he &s;hould not have it in his power to alter the
e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, or grant any church to per&s;ons of the
Roman communion, for the publick exerci&s;e of their re|ligion;
and that he &s;hould be excluded from all &s;hare in
the education of his &s;ons, the elde&s;t of whom &s;hould be
put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country of Hanau upon his father's
acce&s;&s;ion to the regency of the landgraviate. The&s;e re&s;o|lutions
were guarantied by the Kings of Pru&s;&s;ia and Den|mark,
by the Maritime Powers, and the Evangelick Body
of the empire.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The exile of the parliament of Paris, far
from having intimidated the other tribunals from perform|ing
what they apprehended to be their duty, &s;erved only
to inflame the di&s;contents of the people, and to animate
all the courts of ju&s;tice to a full exertion of their authority.
The chatelet continued to pro&s;ecute tho&s;e prie&s;ts who re|fu&s;ed
the &s;acrament to per&s;ons who&s;e con&s;ciences would
not allow them to &s;ub&s;cribe to the bull Unigenitus, even
after three of their members were &s;ent to the Ba&s;tile. The
&s;ame pro&s;ecutions were carried on, and bold remon&s;trances
publi&s;hed by the parliaments of Aix and Rouen. In a
word, the whole kingdom was filled with &s;uch confu&s;ion
as threatened a total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of ju&s;tice, in a general
&s;pirit of di&s;affection, and univer&s;al anarchy. The pre|lates,
mean while, &s;eemed to triumph in the combu&s;tion
they had rai&s;ed. They entered into a&s;&s;ociations to &s;upport
each other; they intrigued at court, and harra&s;&s;ed the
King with in&s;olent declarations, till he grew tired of their
proceedings, and opened his eyes to the fatal con&s;equences
of their pride and ob&s;tinacy. He even took an opportunity
of exhorting the Archbi&s;hop of Paris to act more &s;uitably
<PB N="392" REF="400">
to the character of a clergyman. He recalled the parliament
from exile, and they returned in triumph, amid&s;t the ac|clamations
of the people, who celebrated their arrival at
Paris with the mo&s;t extravagant demon&s;trations of joy;
and the archbi&s;hop, notwith&s;tanding the King's expre&s;s
declaration to the contrary, &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in countenan|cing
the recu&s;ant prie&s;ts, was bani&s;hed to Conflans-&s;ous-Charenton.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. In Spain the intere&s;t of Great-Britain was &s;o warm|ly
e&s;pou&s;ed, and &s;o powerfully &s;upported by Mr. Wall,
who had been re&s;ident in England, that the French party,
though countenanced by the Queen-mother, and &s;u&s;tained
with all the influence of the Marquis de la En&s;enada, the
prime mini&s;ter, was totally defeated. The King being
convinced that it would be for the intere&s;t of his &s;ubjects
to live on good terms with England, and well appri&s;ed of
En&s;enada's intrigues, ordered that mini&s;ter to be arre&s;ted
and confined, and be&s;towed upon Mr. Wall the be&s;t part
of his employments. Neverthele&s;s, the Spaniards in the
We&s;t-Indies continued to oppre&s;s the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain
employed in cutting logwood in the bay of Hondu|ras;
and repre&s;entations on this head being made to the
court of Madrid, the di&s;pute was amicably adju&s;ted between
Mr. Wall and Sir Benjamin Keene, the Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;ador.
While the intere&s;t of Britain thus triumphed in Spain, it
&s;eemed to lo&s;e ground at the court of Li&s;bon. His Portu|gne&s;e
Maje&s;ty had formed va&s;t projects of an active com|merce,
and even e&s;tabli&s;hed an Ea&s;t-India company: in
the mean time he could not help manife&s;ting his chagrin at
the great quantities of gold which were yearly exported
from his dominions, as the balance due from his &s;ubjects
on Engli&s;h commodities. In his endeavours to check this
traffick, which he deemed &s;o detrimental to his &s;ubjects, he
inflicted hard&s;hips on the Briti&s;h merchants &s;ettled at
Li&s;bon: &s;ome were impri&s;oned on frivolous pretences;
others deprived of their property, and obliged to quit the
kingdom. He in&s;i&s;ted upon laying an impo&s;ition of two
per cent. on all the Portugue&s;e gold that &s;hould be ex|ported;
<PB N="393" REF="401">
but the profits of the trade would not bear &s;uch an
exaction. Mean while, there being a &s;carcity of corn in
Portugal, the kingdom was &s;upplied from England; and
the people having nothing but gold to purcha&s;e this ne|ce&s;&s;ary
&s;upply, the King &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of conniving at
the exportation of his coin, and the trade reverted into its
former channel.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. On the fourteenth day of November the King
of Great-Britain opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament with an
harangue, which intimated nothing of an approaching
rupture. He &s;aid, That the general &s;tate of affairs in
Europe had undergone very little alteration &s;ince their la&s;t
meeting; that he had lately received the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;uran|ces
from his good brother the King of Spain of friend&s;hip
and confidence, which he would cultivate with harmony
and good faith. He declared his principal view &s;hould be
to &s;trengthen the foundation, and &s;ecure the duration of a
general peace; to improve the pre&s;ent advantages of it for
promoting the trade of his good &s;ubjects, and protecting
tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which con&s;tituted one great &s;ource of their
wealth and commerce. Finally, he exhorted them to
complete their plan for appropriating the forfeited e&s;tates
in the Highlands to the &s;ervice of the publick. He pro|bably
avoided mentioning the encroachments of France,
that he might &s;upply no handle for debates on the addre&s;s,
which was carried in both Hou&s;es almo&s;t without oppo|&s;ition.
The government &s;eemed determined to humble
the in&s;olence of the French councils; and this di&s;po&s;ition
was &s;o agreeable to the people in general, that they grudg|ed
no expen&s;e, and heartily concurred with the demands
of the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. The Commons granted for the &s;ervice of the
en&s;uing year four millions &s;eventy-three thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and twenty-nine pounds; one million of that &s;um
expre&s;sly given for enabling his Maje&s;ty to augment his
forces by land and &s;ea. Thirty-two thou&s;and pounds were
allotted as a &s;ub&s;idy to the King of Poland, and twenty
thou&s;and to the Elector of Bavaria. The&s;e gratifications
<PB N="394" REF="402">
met with little or no oppo&s;ition in the committee of &s;upply;
becau&s;e it was taken for granted, that, in ca&s;e of a rupture,
France would endeavour to avail her&s;elf of her &s;uperiority
by land, by invading his Britannick Maje&s;ty's German
dominions; and therefore it might be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch allies on the continent. That they
progno&s;ticated aright, with re&s;pect to the de&s;igns of that
ambitious power, will &s;oon appear in the cour&s;e of this
hi&s;tory; which will al&s;o demon&s;trate how little dependence
is to be placed upon the profe&s;&s;ed attachment of &s;ub&s;idiary
princes. The &s;upplies were rai&s;ed by the &s;tanding
branches of the revenue, the land tax and malt tax, and a
lottery for one million; one hundred thou&s;and pounds of
it to be deducted for the &s;ervice of the publick, and the
remaining nine hundred thou&s;and to be charged on the
produce of the &s;inking fund, at the rate of three per cent.
per annum, to commence from the fifth day of January
in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;ix. The
civil tran&s;actions of this &s;e&s;&s;ion were confined to a few ob|jects.
Divers new regulations were made for encouraging
and improving the whale and white herring fi&s;hery, as well
as for fini&s;hing and putting in a proper &s;tate of defence a
new fort, lately built at Anamaboc on the coa&s;t of Africa.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. Mr. Pitt, the payma&s;ter-general of the forces,
brought in a bill, which will ever remain a &s;tanding monu|ment
of his humanity. The poor di&s;abled veterans, who
enjoyed the pen&s;ion of Chel&s;ea ho&s;pital, were &s;o iniqui|tou&s;ly
oppre&s;&s;ed by a &s;et of mi&s;creants, who &s;upplied them
with money per advance, at the mo&s;t exorbitant rates of
u&s;ury, that many of them, with their families, were in
danger of &s;tarving; and the intention of government in
granting &s;uch a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence was in a great
mea&s;ure defeated. Mr. Pitt, perceiving that this evil
originally flowed from the delay of the fir&s;t payment, which
the pen&s;ioner could not touch till the expiration of a
whole year after he had been put upon the li&s;t, removed
this nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing, by providing in the bill, that
half a year's pen&s;ion &s;hould be advanced half a year before
<PB N="395" REF="403">
it is due; and the practice of u&s;ury was effectually prevented
by a clau&s;e, enacting, that all contracts &s;hould be void by
which any pen&s;ion might be mortgaged. This humane
regulation was unanimou&s;ly approved, and having pa&s;&s;ed
through both Hou&s;es with uncommon expedition, received
the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. Notwith&s;tanding the unanimity manife&s;ted
by the Commons, in every thing relating to the mea|&s;ures
for acting vigorou&s;ly again&s;t the common enemy of
the nation, they were remarkably di&s;turbed and divided by
a conte&s;ted election of members for Oxford&s;hire. In the
cour&s;e of this di&s;pute, the &s;trength and influence of what
they called the old and new intere&s;t, or, to &s;peak more in|telligibly,
of the Tories and Whigs in that county, were
fully di&s;played. The candidates &s;u&s;tained on the &s;houlders
of the old intere&s;t, were Lord Vi&s;count Wenman and
Sir James Da&s;hwood: their competitors, whom the new
intere&s;t &s;upported, and of con&s;equence the mini&s;try coun|tenanced,
were Lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner.
Never was any contention of this kind maintained with
more &s;pirit and animo&s;ity, or carried on at a greater expen&s;e.
One would have imagined that each &s;ide con&s;idered it as a
di&s;pute which mu&s;t have determined, whether the nation
&s;hould enjoy its ancient liberty, or tamely &s;ubmit to the
&s;etters of corruption. Noblemen and gentlemen, clergy-men
and ladies, employed all their talents and indu&s;try in
canva&s;&s;ing for either &s;ide, throughout every town&s;hip and
village in the county. Scandal emptied her whole quiver
of in&s;inuation, calumny, and lampoon; corruption was
not remi&s;s in promi&s;es and pre&s;ents: hou&s;es of entertain|ment
were opened; and nothing was for &s;ome time to be
&s;een but &s;cenes of tumult, riot, and intoxication. The
revenue of many an independent prince on the con|tinent
would not have been &s;ufficient to afford &s;uch &s;ums
of money as were expended in the cour&s;e of this di&s;pute.
At length they proceeded to election, and the &s;heriff made
a double return of all the four candidates, &s;o that not one
of them could &s;it, and the county remained without a re|pre&s;entative
<PB N="396" REF="404">
pre&s;entative until this ambiguous affair could be decided
in the Hou&s;e of Commons. About the middle of Novem|ber
petitions being pre&s;ented by the four candidates, as
well as by the gentlemen, clergy, and other freeholders of
the county, complaining of an undue election, and double
return, the matter of the&s;e petitions was heard at the bar
of the Hou&s;e on the third day of December. The coun&s;el
for Lord Wenman and Sir James Da&s;h wood alledged, that
they had the majority of votes upon the poll, and this cir|cum&s;tance
was admitted by the coun&s;el on the other &s;ide:
then they proceeded to prove by evidence, that, after clo&s;ing
the poll, the &s;heriff declared the majority of votes to be in
favour of the&s;e two candidates, and adjourned the court
from the twenty-third day of April to the eighth of May;
&s;o that the &s;crutiny demanded, and granted on the behalf of
Lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner could not be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed
before the la&s;t day of the month, when the writ was re|turnable;
that the &s;crutiny did not begin till the ninth
day of May, when the time was protracted by disputes
about the manner in which it &s;hould be carried on; that
Lord Parker and Sir Edward Turner were allowed to ob|ject,
through the whole poll, to the votes on the other
&s;ide, on pretence that their competitors &s;hould be permitted
to an&s;wer the&s;e objections, and, in their turn, object through
the whole poll to the voters for Lord Parker and Sir Ed|ward
Turner, who &s;hould, in the la&s;t place, have leave
to answer: that Lord Wenman and Sir James Da&s;hwood
had di&s;approved of this method, becau&s;e they apprehended
it might induce their competitors to make &s;uch a number of
frivolous objections, that they &s;hould not have time to
an&s;wer one half of them, much le&s;s to make objections of
their own before the writ &s;hould be returned: that they
fore&s;aw &s;uch a number of frivolous objections were made,
as engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the court till the twenty-&s;eventh
day of May; &s;o that they could not begin to an|&s;wer
any of the&s;e objections till the twenty-eighth; and on
the thirtieth the &s;heriff, having clo&s;ed the &s;crutiny, made
the double return. The proof being exhibited, the coun|&s;el
<PB N="397" REF="405">
in&s;i&s;ted, that, as they had e&s;tabli&s;hed a majority on the
poll, and demon&s;trated that this majority neither was nor
could be overthrown by &s;uch an unfini&s;hed scrutiny, it
was incumbent on the other &s;ide to proceed upon the merits
of the election, by endeavouring to overthrow that ma|jority
of which their clients were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. A que&s;tion
in the Hou&s;e being carried to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, Lord Wen|man
and Sir James Da&s;hwood objected to five hundred
and thirty voters on the other &s;ide, whom they propo&s;ed to
di&s;qualify. Their coun&s;el examined &s;everal witne&s;&s;es, to
prove the partiality of the &s;heriff in favour of Lord Parker
and Sir Edward Turner, and to detect the&s;e candidates in
the practice of bribery; for which purpo&s;e they produced
a letter in their own handwriting. They afterwards
proceeded to di&s;qualify particular votes, and &s;ummed up
their evidence on the twenty-fir&s;t day of January.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1755.</NOTE> Then
the coun&s;el for the other &s;ide began to refute the charge of
partiality and corruption; and to an&s;wer the objections
that had been made to particular voters. They produced
evidence to prove, that cu&s;tomary freeholds, or customary
holdings, had voted at elections in the counties of Glamor|gan,
Monmouth, Glouce&s;ter, Wells, and Hereford; and
that the cu&s;tomary tenants of the manor of Wood&s;tock, in
Oxford&s;hire, had been reputed capable of voting, and even
voted at elections for that county. In a word, they con|tinued
to examine evidences, argue and refute, prove and
di&s;prove, until the twenty-third day of April, when, after
&s;ome warm debates and divi&s;ions in the Hou&s;e, Lord Par|ker
and Sir Edward Turner were declared duly elected:
and the clerk of the crown was ordered to amend the re|turn,
by era&s;ing the names of Lord Wenman and Sir
James Da&s;hwood. Many who pre&s;umed to think for them|&s;elves,
without recollecting the power and influence of the
admini&s;tration, were a&s;toni&s;hed at the i&s;&s;ue of this di&s;pute;
which, however, might have ea&s;ily been fore&s;een; ina&s;|much
as, during the cour&s;e of the proceedings, mo&s;t, if
not all, of the many que&s;tions debated in the Hou&s;e were
determined by a great majority in favour of the new in|tere&s;t.
<PB N="398" REF="406">
A great number of copy-holders had been admitted
to vote at this election,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1755.</NOTE> and the &s;heriff incurred no cen&s;ure
for allowing them to take the oath appointed by law to be
taken by freeholders: neverthele&s;s, the Commons carefully
avoided determining the que&s;tion; Whether copy-holders
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the yearly value of forty &s;hillings, clear of all
deductions, have not a right to vote for knights to repre|&s;ent
the &s;hire within which their copy-hold e&s;tates are
&s;ituated? This point being left doubtful by the legi&s;lature,
puts it often in the power of the &s;heriff to return which of
the candidates he plea&s;es to &s;upport; for, if the majority of
the voting copy-holders adheres to the intere&s;t of his fa|vourites,
he will admit their votes both on the poll and the
&s;crutiny; whereas, &s;hould they be otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed, he

may have upon the independency of parliament every per|&s;on

counties of England the high &s;heriffs are annually appoint|ed

<P>&sect; XLV. The attention of the legi&s;lature was chiefly
turned upon the conduct of France, which pre&s;erved no
medium, but &s;eemed intent upon &s;triking &s;ome important
blow, that might &s;erve as a declaration of war. At Bre&s;t,
and other ports in that kingdom, the French were employed
in equipping a powerful armament, and made no &s;cruple to
own it was intended for North-America. Towards the
latter end of March Sir Thomas Robin&s;on, &s;ecretary of
&s;tate, brought a me&s;&s;age from the King to the parliament,
intimating, That his Maje&s;ty having at the beginning of the
&s;e&s;&s;ion declared his principal object was to pre&s;erve the
publick tranquillity, and at the &s;ame time to protect tho&s;e
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which con&s;titute one great &s;ource of the com|merce
and wealth of his kingdom, he now found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to acquaint the Hou&s;e of Commons, that the pre&s;ent
&s;ituation of affairs made it requisite to augment his forces
by &s;ea and land, and to take &s;uch other mea&s;ures as might
be&s;t tend to pre&s;erve the general peace of Europe, and to
&s;ecure the ju&s;t rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his crown in Ame|rica,
<PB N="399" REF="407">
as well as to repel any attempts what&s;oever that might
be made to &s;upport or countenance any de&s;igns which
&s;hould be formed again&s;t his Maje&s;ty and his kingdoms;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. III. 1755.</NOTE>
and his Maje&s;ty doubted not but his faithful Commons, on
who&s;e affection and zeal he entirely relied, would enable
him to make &s;uch augmentations, and to take &s;uch mea|&s;ures
for &s;upporting the honour of his crown, and the true
intere&s;ts of his people, and for the &s;ecurity of his domi|nions
in the pre&s;ent critical conjuncture, as the exigency of
affairs might require; in doing which his Maje&s;ty would
have as much regard to the ea&s;e of his good &s;ubjects as
&s;hould be con&s;i&s;tent with their &s;afety and welfare. In an|&s;wer
to this me&s;&s;age a very warm and affectionate addre&s;s
was pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty; and it was on this occa&s;ion
that the million was granted for augmenting his forces by
&s;ea and land<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The mini&s;try having re&s;olved to &s;end a body of forces to America, to act in conjunction with the provincial troops rai&s;ed on that continent, it be|came nece&s;&s;ary that the mutiny act &s;hould be rendered more clear and exten|&s;ive. When this bill, therefore, fell under con&s;ideration, it was improved with a new clau&s;e, providing, &startq;That all officers and &s;oldiers of any troops being mu&s;tered and in pay, which are or &s;hall be rai&s;ed in any of the Bri|ti&s;h provinces in America, by authority of the re&s;pective governors or go|vernments thereof, &s;hall, at all times, and in all places, when they happen to join or act in conjunction with his Maje&s;ty's Briti&s;h forces, be liable to martial law and di&s;cipline, in like manner, to all intents and purpo&s;es, as the Briti&s;h forces are and &s;hall be &s;ubject to the &s;ame trial, penalties, and puni&s;hment.&endq;</NOTE> The court of Ver&s;ailles, notwith&s;tanding
the a&s;&s;iduity and di&s;patch which they were exerting in

to amu&s;e the Briti&s;h mini&s;try with general declarations,
that no ho&s;tility was intended, nor the lea&s;t infringement of
the treaty.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVI. The Earl of Albemarle, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;a|dor
at Paris, having lately died in that city, the&s;e a&s;&s;ur|ances
were communicated to the court of London by the
Marquis de Mirepoix, who re&s;ided in England with the
&s;ame character, which he had &s;upported &s;ince his fir&s;t ar|rival
with equal honour and politene&s;s. On this occa&s;ion
he him&s;elf was &s;o far impo&s;ed upon by the in&s;tructions he
<PB N="400" REF="408">
had received, that he believed the profe&s;&s;ions of his court
were &s;incere, and &s;eriou&s;ly endeavoured to prevent a rup|ture
between the two nations. At length, however, their
preparations were &s;o notorious that he began to &s;u&s;pect
the con&s;equence; and the Engli&s;h mini&s;try produced &s;uch
proofs of their in&s;incerity and double dealing, that he
&s;eemed to be &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment and chagrin. He
repaired to France, and upbraided the mini&s;try of Ver&s;ailles
for having made him the tool of their di&s;&s;imulation. They
referred him to the King, who ordered him to return to
London, with fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances of his pacifick intentions:
but his practice agreed &s;o ill with his profe&s;&s;ions, that the
amba&s;&s;ador had &s;carce obtained an audience to communi|cate
them, when undoubted intelligence arrived, that a
powerful armament was ready to &s;ail from Bre&s;t and Roche|fort.
The government of Great-Britain, arou&s;ed by this
information, immediately took the mo&s;t expeditious me|thods
for equipping a &s;quadron; and towards the latter
end of April, Admiral Bo&s;cawen &s;ailed with eleven &s;hips
of the line and one frigate, having on board a con&s;iderable
number of land-forces, to attend the motions of the ene|my:
but more certain and particular intelligence arriving
&s;oon after, touching the &s;trength of the French fleet, which
con&s;i&s;ted of twenty-five &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates
and tran&s;ports, with a great quantity of warlike &s;tores,
and four thou&s;and regular troops, commanded by the
Baron Die&s;kau, Admiral Holbourne was detached with
&s;ix &s;hips of the line, and one frigate, to re-enforce Mr. Bo&s;|cawen;
and a great number of capital &s;hips were put in
commi&s;&s;ion. In the beginning of May the French fleet
commanded by Mr. Macnamara, an officer of Iri&s;h ex|traction,
&s;ailed from Bre&s;t, directing his cour&s;e to North-America;
but, after having proceeded beyond the chop$
of the Engli&s;h channel, he returned with nine of the capi|tal
&s;hips, while the re&s;t of the armament continued their
cour&s;e, under the direction of M. Bois de la Mothe.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVII. On the twenty-fifth day of April the King
went to the Hou&s;e of Lords, where, after giving the royal
<PB N="401" REF="409">
a&s;&s;ent to the bills then depending; for granting a certain
&s;um out of the &s;inking-fund, for the relief of in&s;olvent
debtors, for the better regulation of the marine forces on
&s;hore, for the better rai&s;ing of marines and &s;eamen, and
to &s;everal other publick and private bills; his Maje&s;ty put
an end to the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament by a &s;peech, in which
he acquainted the two hou&s;es, That the zeal they had
&s;hown for &s;upporting the honour, rights, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
of his crown had afforded him the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction:
That his de&s;ire to pre&s;erve the publick tranquility had
been &s;incere and uniform: That he had religiou&s;ly adher|ed
to the &s;tipulations of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, and
made it his care not to injure or offend any power what&s;oe|ver;
but that he never could entertain a thought of pur|cha&s;ing
the name of peace at the expen&s;e of &s;uffering en|croachments
upon, or of yielding up, what ju&s;tly belong|ed
to Great-Britain, either by ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or by
&s;olemn treaties: That the vigour and firmne&s;s of his par|liament;
on this important occa&s;ion, had enabled him to
be prepared for &s;uch contingencies as might happen: That
if reasonable and honourable terms of accommodation
could be agreed upon; he would be &s;atisfied, and, at all
events, rely on the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, the effectual &s;up|port
of his people, and the protection of Divine Provi|dence.
The parliament was then prorogued to the twen|ty-&s;eventh
of May.</P>

<P>&sect; I. WHILST all Europe was in &s;u&s;pen&s;e about the
fate of the Engli&s;h and French &s;quadrons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1755.</NOTE>
preparations for a vigorous &s;ea war were going forward in
England with an unparallelled &s;pirit and &s;ucce&s;s. Still the
French court flattered it&s;elf that Great-Britain, out of
tenderne&s;s to his Maje&s;ty's German dominions, would ab|&s;tain
from ho&s;tilities. Mirepoix continued to have fre|quent
conferences with the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, who made no
&s;ecret that their admirals, particularly Bo&s;cawen, had or|ders
to attack the French &s;hips wherever they &s;hould meet
them. On the other hand, Mon&s;. de Mirepoix declared,
That his ma&s;ter would con&s;ider the fir&s;t gun fired at &s;ea
in a ho&s;tile manner as a declaration of war. This me|nance,
far from intimidating the Engli&s;h, animated them
to redouble their preparations for war. The pre&s;s for
&s;eamen was carried on with extraordinary vigour in all
parts of this kingdom, as well as in Ireland; and great
premiums were given not only by the government, but
al&s;o, over and above his Maje&s;ty's bounty, by almo&s;t
all the con&s;iderable cities and towns in England, to &s;uch
as &s;hould inli&s;t voluntarily for &s;ailors or &s;oldiers. Other
branches of the public &s;ervice went on with equal alacrity:
and &s;uch was the eagerne&s;s of the people to lend their
money to the government, that in&s;tead of one million,
which was to be rai&s;ed by way of lottery, three millions
eight hundred and eighty thou&s;and pounds were &s;ub&s;cribed
immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="412">
&sect; II. The &s;ituation of affairs requiring his Maje&s;ty to
go to Germany this &s;ummer, great apprehen&s;ions aro&s;e
in the minds of many, le&s;t the French &s;hould either in|tercept
him in his journey, or prevent his return. Earl
Paulet had made a motion in the Hou&s;e of Lords, humbly
to repre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty, &startq;That it was an article in
the original act of &s;ettlement by which the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
the&s;e kingdoms devolved to his electoral hou&s;e, that the
King &s;hould not go to his foreign dominions without the
con&s;ent of parliament; and that this was a principal ar|ticle
in the compact between the crown and the people:
That though this article was repealed in the late reign,
yet, till of late, it had always been the cu&s;tom for his
Maje&s;ty to acquaint the parliament with his intended de|parture
to his German dominions, both in regard to the
true &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of the act that placed him on the
throne, as well as for the paternal kindne&s;s of his royal
heart, and the conde&s;cen&s;ion he had been &s;o good to &s;how
his parliament on all occa&s;ions; but that his Maje&s;ty's de|claration
of his de&s;ign to vi&s;it his electoral e&s;tates had
always come on the la&s;t day of a &s;e&s;&s;ion, when it was too
late for the great con&s;titutional council of the crown to
offer &s;uch advice as might otherwi&s;e have been expedient
and nece&s;&s;ary: That his Maje&s;ty's leaving his kingdoms
in a conjuncture &s;o pregnant with di&s;tre&s;s, &s;o denuncia|tive
of danger, would not only give the greate&s;t advan|tage
to &s;uch as might be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;tir up di&s;affection and
di&s;content, and to the con&s;titutional and national enemies
of England; but would al&s;o fill his loyal &s;ubjects with the
mo&s;t affecting concern, and mo&s;t gloomy fears, as well
for their own &s;afety, as for that of their &s;overeign, who&s;e
invaluable life, at all times of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to
his people, was then infinitely &s;o, by rea&s;on of his great
experience, the affection of every one to his royal per&s;on,
and the minority of the heir apparent.&endq; Such was the
purport of this motion; but it was not &s;econded by any
of the other lords.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="413">
&sect; III. The general unea&s;ine&s;s, account of his Ma|je&s;ty's
departure, was greatly increa&s;ed by an apprehen&s;ion
that there would, during his ab&s;ence, be no good agree|ment
among&s;t the regency, which con&s;i&s;ted of the follow|ing
per&s;ons: his royal highne&s;s William Duke of Cum|berland;
Thomas Lord Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury;
Phillip Earl of Hardwicke, lord high chancellor; John
Earl of Granville, pre&s;ident of the council; Charles
Duke of Marlborough, lord privy-&s;eal; John Duke of
Rutland, &s;teward of the hou&s;ehold; Charles Duke of
Grafton, lord chamberlain; Archibald Duke of Argyle;
the Duke of Newca&s;tle, fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea|&s;ury;
the Duke of Dor&s;et, ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e; the Earl
of Holderne&s;&s;e, one of the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate; the Earl
of Rochford, groom of the &s;tole; the Marquis of Har|tington,
lord-lieutenant of Ireland; Lord An&s;on, fir&s;t
commi&s;&s;ioner of the Admiralty; Sir Thomas Robin&s;on,
&s;ecretary of &s;tate; and Henry Fox, E&s;q, &s;ecretary at war.
His Maje&s;ty &s;et out from St. James's on the twenty-eighth
of April early in the morning, embarked at Harwich in
the afternoon, landed the next day at Helvoet&s;luys, and
arrived at Hanover on the &s;econd of May.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. Admiral Bo&s;cawen, with eleven &s;hips of the line
and a frigate, having taken on board two regiments at
Plymouth, &s;ailed from thence on the twenty-&s;eventh of
April for the banks of Newfoundland; and, in a few
days after his arrival there, the French fleet from Bre&s;t
came to the &s;ame &s;tation, under the command of M. Bois
de la Mothe. But the thick fogs which prevailed upon
the&s;e coa&s;ts, e&s;pecially at that time of the year, kept the
two armaments from &s;eeing each other; and part of the
French &s;quadron e&s;caped up the river St Laurence,
whil&s;t another part of them went round, and got into the
&s;ame river though the &s;traits of Bellei&s;le, by a way which
was never known to be attempted before by &s;hips of the
line. However, whil&s;t the Engli&s;h fleet lay off Cape Race,
which is the &s;outhernmo&s;t point of New&s;oundland, and
was thought to be the mo&s;t proper &s;ituation for inter|cepting
<PB N="406" REF="414">
the enemy, two French &s;hips, the Alcide, of
&s;ixty-four guns, and four hundred and eighty men, and
the Lys, pierced for &s;ixty four guns, but mounting only
twenty-two, having eight companies of land forces on
board, being &s;eparated from the re&s;t of their fleet in the
fog, fell in with the Dunkirk, Captain Howe, and the
Defiance, Captain Andrews, two &s;ixty gun &s;hips of the
Engli&s;h &s;quadron; and after a &s;mart engagement, which
la&s;ted &s;ome hours, and in which Captain (afterwards
Lord) Howe behaved with the greate&s;t &s;kill and intrepidi|ty,
were both taken, with &s;everal con&s;iderable officers and
engineers, and about eight thou&s;and pounds in money.
Though the capture of the&s;e &s;hips, from which the com|mencement
of the war may in fact be dated, fell greatly
&s;hort of what was hoped for from this expedition; yet
when the news of it reached England, it was of infinite
&s;ervice to the publick credit of every kind, and animated
the whole nation, who now &s;aw plainly that the govern|ment
was determined to keep no further mea&s;ures with
the French, but ju&s;tly to repel force by force, and put a
&s;top to their &s;ending more men and arms to invade the pro|perty
of the Engli&s;h in America, as they had hitherto done
with impunity. The French, who, for &s;ome time, did
not even attempt to make repri&s;als on our &s;hipping, would
gladly have cho&s;en to avoid a war at that time, and to
have continued extending their encroachments on our &s;et|tlements,
till they had executed thier grand plan of &s;ecur|ing
a communication from the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi to Canada, by
a line of forts, many of which they had already erected.</P>
<P>&sect; V. Upon the arrival of the news of this action at
Paris, the French amba&s;&s;ador, M. de Mirepoix, was re|called
from London, and M. de Bu&s;&s;y from Hanover,
where he had ju&s;t arrived, to attend the King of England
in a publick character. They complained loudly of Bo&s;|cawen's
attacking the &s;hips, as a breach of national faith:
but it was ju&s;tly retorted on the part of England, that their
encroachments in America had rendered repri&s;als both
ju&s;tifiable and nece&s;&s;ary. The re&s;olution of making them
<PB N="407" REF="415">
was the effect of mature deliberation in the Engli&s;h council.
The va&s;t increa&s;e of the French marine of late years, which
in all probability would &s;oon be employed again&s;t Great-Britain,
occa&s;ioned an order for making repri&s;als general
in Europe as well as in America; and that all French
&s;hips, whether outward or homeward bound, &s;hould be
&s;topped, and brought into Briti&s;h ports. To give the greater
weight to the&s;e orders, it was re&s;olved to &s;end out tho&s;e
admirals who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves mo&s;t towards
the end of the la&s;t war. Accordingly, on the twenty-fir&s;t
of July, Sir Edward Hawke &s;ailed on a crui&s;e to the we&s;t|ward,
with eighteen &s;hips of the line, a frigate, and a
&s;loop; but, not meeting with the French fleet, the&s;e &s;hips
returned to England about the latter end of September and
the beginning of October; on the fourteenth of which
la&s;t month another fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-two &s;hips
of the line, two frigates, and two &s;loops, &s;ailed again on
a crui&s;e to the we&s;tward under Admiral Byng, in hopes
of intercepting the French &s;quadron under Duguay, and
likewi&s;e that commanded by La Mothe, in ca&s;e of its
return from America. But this fleet likewi&s;e returned to
Spithead on the twenty-&s;econd of November, without
having been able to effect any thing, though it was allow|ed
by all, that the admiral had acted judiciou&s;ly in the
choice of his &s;tations.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. While the&s;e mea&s;ures were pur&s;ued, for the general
&s;ecurity of the Briti&s;h coa&s;ts and trade in Europe, &s;everal
new &s;hips of war were begun, and fini&s;hed with the utmo&s;t
expedition, in his Maje&s;ty's docks: twelve frigates and
&s;loops, contracted for in private yards, were completed
by the month of Augu&s;t; and twenty-four &s;hips and twelve
colliers were then taken into the &s;ervice of the government,
to be fitted out as ve&s;&s;els of war, to carry twenty guns and
one hundred and twenty men each.&mdash;In the mean time the
French trade was &s;o annoyed by the Engli&s;h crui&s;ers, that
before the end of this year three hundred of their mer|chant
&s;hips, many of which, from St. Domingo and Mar|tinico,
were extremely rich, and eight thou&s;and of their
<PB N="408" REF="416">
&s;ailors, were brought into Engli&s;h ports. By the&s;e cap|tures
the Briti&s;h mini&s;try an&s;wered many purpo&s;es: they
deprived the French of a great body of &s;eamen, and with|held
from them a very large property, the want of which
greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed their people, and ruined many of their
traders. Their outward-bound merchant &s;hips were in|&s;ured
at the rate of thirty per cent. whil&s;t the Engli&s;h paid
no more than the common in&s;urance. This intolerable
burthen was felt by all degrees of people among&s;t them:
their mini&s;try was publickly reviled, even by their parlia|ments;
and the French name, from being the terrour,
began to be the contempt of Europe. Their unea&s;ine&s;s
was al&s;o not a little heightened by new broils between their
King and the parliament of Paris, occa&s;ioned by the ob|&s;tinancy
of the clergy of that kingdom, who &s;eemed de|termined
to &s;upport the church, in all events, again&s;t the
&s;ecular tribunals, and, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to enforce
the ob&s;ervance of the bull Unigenitus, which had long
been the occa&s;ion of &s;o many di&s;putes among them. How|ever,
the parliament continuing firm, and the French
King approving of its conduct, the eccle&s;ia&s;ticks thought
proper to &s;ubmit for the pre&s;ent; and in their general
a&s;&s;embly this year granted him a free gift of &s;ixteen mil|lions
of livres, which he demanded of them&mdash;a greater &s;um
than they had ever given before, even in time of war.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. In the beginning of this year the a&s;&s;embly of
Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's-Bay in New-England pa&s;&s;ed an act, pro|hibiting
all corre&s;pondence with the French at Loui&s;bourg;
and early in the &s;pring they rai&s;ed a body of troops, which
was tran&s;ported to Nova-Scotia, to a&s;&s;i&s;t Lieutenant-Go|vernor
Laurence in driving the French from the encroach|ments
they had made upon that province. Accordingly,
towards the end of May, the governor &s;ent a large de|tachment
of troops, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel
Monckton, upon this &s;ervice; and three frigates
and a &s;loop were di&s;patched up the bay of Fundy, under
the command of Captain Rous, to give their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
by &s;ea. The troops, upon their arrival at the river
<PB N="409" REF="417">
Ma&s;&s;agua&s;h, found the pa&s;&s;age &s;topped by a large number of
regular forces, rebel neutrals, or Acadians, and Indians,
four hundred and fifty of whom occupied a block-hou&s;e,
with cannon mounted on their &s;ide of the river; and the
re&s;t were po&s;ted within a &s;trong brea&s;t-work of timber,
thrown up by way of outwork to the block-hou&s;e. The
Engli&s;h provincials attacked this place with &s;uch &s;pirit,
that the enemy were obliged to fly, and leave them in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the brea&s;t-work: then the garri&s;on in the block-hou&s;e
de&s;erted it, and left the pa&s;&s;age of the river free.
From thence Colonel Monckton advanced to the French
fort of Beau-&s;ejour, which he inve&s;ted as far at lea&s;t as
the &s;mall number of his troops would permit, on the twelfth
of June; and after four days bombardment obliged it to
&s;urrender, though the French had twenty-&s;ix pieces of
cannon mounted, and plenty of ammunition, and the
Engli&s;h had not yet placed a &s;ingle cannon upon their
batteries. The garri&s;on was &s;ent to Loui&s;bourg, on con|dition
of not bearing arms in America for the &s;pace of &s;ix
months; and the Acadians, who had joined the French,
were pardoned, in con&s;ideration of their having been
forced into that &s;ervice. Colonel Monckton, after put|ting
a garri&s;on into this place, and changing its name
to that of Cumberland, the next day attacked and re|duced
the other French fort upon the river of Ga&s;pereau,
which runs into Bay Verte; where he likewi&s;e found a
large quantity of provi&s;ions and &s;tores of all kinds, that
being the chief magazine for &s;upplying the French Indians
and Acadians with arms, ammunition, and other nece&s;|&s;aries.
He then di&s;armed the&s;e la&s;t, to the number of
fifteen thou&s;and: aad in the mean time, Captain Rous
with his &s;hips &s;ailed to the mouth of the river St. John,
to attack the new $ort the French had erected there; but
they &s;aved him that trouble, by abandoning it upon his
appearance, after having bur&s;t their cannon, blown up
their magazine, and de&s;troyed, as far as they had time,
all the works they had lately rai&s;ed. The Engli&s;h had
but twenty men killed, and about the &s;ame number
<PB N="410" REF="418">
wounded, in the whole of this expedition, the &s;ucce&s;s of
which &s;ecured the tranquillity of Nova-Scotia.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. While the New-Englanders were thus employ|ed
in reducing the French in Nova-Scotia, preparations
were made in Virginia for attacking them upon the Ohio.
A fort was built, which was likewi&s;e called Fort-Cumber|land,
and a camp formed at Wills's-Creek. On the four|teenth
of January of this year, Major-General Braddock,
with Colonel Dunbar's and Colonel Halket's regiments of
foot, failed from Cork, in Ireland, for Virginia, where
they all landed &s;afe before the end of February. This
General might con&s;equently have entered upon action
early in the &s;pring, had he not been unfortunately delayed
by the Virgian contractors for the army, who, when he
was ready to march, had neither provided a &s;ufficient quan|tity
of provi&s;ions for his troops, nor a competent number
of carriages for his army. This accident was fore&s;een by
almo&s;t every per&s;on who knew any thing of our plantations
upon the continent of America: for the people of Vir|ginia,
who think of no produce but their tobacco, and do
not rai&s;e corn enough even for their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, be|ing,
by the nature of their country, well provided with
the conveniency of water conveyance, have but few wheel-carriages,
or bea&s;ts of burthen; whereas Penn&s;ylvania,
which abounds in corn, and mo&s;t other &s;orts of provi&s;ions,
had but little water-carriage, e&s;pecially in its we&s;tern &s;ettle|ments,
where its inhabitants have great numbers of carts,
waggons, and hor&s;es. Mr. Braddock &s;hould, therefore,
certainly, in point of prudence, have landed in Penn&s;yl|vania:
the contract for &s;upplying his troops &s;hould have
been made with &s;ome of the chief planters there, who could
ea&s;ily have performed their engagements; and if his camp
had been formed near Frank's-town, or &s;omewhere upon
the &s;outh-we&s;t borders of that province, he would not
have had eighty miles to march from thence to Fort Du
Que&s;ne, in&s;tead of an hundred and thirty miles that he had
to advance from Wills's-Creek, where he did encamp,
through roads neither better nor more practicable than the
<PB N="411" REF="419">
other would have been. This error, in the very beginning
of the expedition, whether owing to an injudicious prefer|ence
fondly given to the Virginians in the lucrative job of
&s;upplying the&s;e troops, or to any other cau&s;e, delayed the
march of the army for &s;ome weeks, during which it was
in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s for nece&s;&s;aries of all kinds; and
would probably have defeated the expedition entirely for
that &s;ummer, had not the contractors found means to
procure &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the back &s;ettlements of Penn|&s;ylvania.
But even when the&s;e &s;upplies did arrive, they
con&s;i&s;ted of only fifteen waggons, and an hundred draft
hor&s;es, in&s;tead of an hundred and fifty waggons and three
hundred hor&s;es, which the Virginian contractors had en|gaged
to furni&s;h, and the provi&s;ions were &s;o bad that they
could not be u&s;ed. However, &s;ome gentlemen in Penn&s;yl|vania,
being applied to in this exigency, amply made up
for the&s;e deficienoies, and the troops were by this means
&s;upplied with every thing they wanted. Another, and
&s;till more fatal, error was committed in the choice of the
commander for this expedition. Major-General Braddock,
who was appointed to it, was undoubtedly a man of cou|rage,
and expert in all the punctilions of a review, having
been brought up in the Engli&s;h guards; but he was na|turally
very haughty, po&s;itive, and difficult of acce&s;s;
qualities ill &s;uited to the temper of the people among&s;t
whom he was to command. His extreme &s;everity in mat|ters
of di&s;cipline had rendered him unpopular among the
&s;oldiers; and the &s;trict military education in which he had
been trained from his youth, and which he prided him&s;elf
or &s;crupulou&s;ly following, made him hold the American
militia in great contempt, becau&s;e they could not go
through their exerci&s;e with the &s;ame dexterity and regu|larity
as a regiment of guards in Hyde-Park, little know|ing,
or indeed being able to form any idea of the difference
between the European manner of fighting, and an American
expedition through woods, de&s;erts, and mora&s;&s;es. Before
he left England, he received, in the hand-writing of Col.
Napier, a &s;et of in&s;tructions from the Duke of Cumberland.
<PB N="412" REF="420">
By the&s;e, the attempt upon Niagara was, in a great mea|&s;ure,
referred to him; and the reduction of Crown-Point
was to be left chiefly to the provincial forces. But above
all, his Royal Highne&s;s, both verbally and in this writing,
frequently cautioned him carefully to beware of an ambu&s;h
or &s;urpri&s;e. In&s;tead of regarding this &s;alutary caution, his
conceit of his own abilities made him di&s;dain to a&s;k the
opinion of any under his command; and the Indians, who
would have been his &s;afe&s;t guards again&s;t this danger in
particular, were &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted by the haughtine&s;s of his beha|viour,
that mo&s;t of them for&s;ook his banners. Under the&s;e
di&s;advantages he began his march from Fort-Cumberland
on the tenth of June, at the head of about two thou&s;and
two hundred men, for the Meadows, where Colonel Wa&s;h|ington
was defeated the year bifore. Upon his arrival
there, he was informed that the French at Fort du Que&s;ne,
which had lately been built on the &s;ame river, near its con|fluence
with the Monangahela, expected a re-enforcement
of five hundred regular troops: therefore, that he might
march with the greater di&s;patch, he left Colonel Dunbar
with eight hundred men to bring up the provi&s;ions, &s;tores,
and heavy baggage, as fa&s;t as the nature of the &s;ervice would
permit; and with the other twelve hundred, together with
ten pieces of cannon, and the nece&s;&s;ary ammunion and
provi&s;ions, he marched on with &s;o much expedition, that
he &s;eldom took any time to reconnoitre the woods or thickets
he was to pa&s;s through; as if the nearer he approached the
enemy, the farther he was removed from danger.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. On the eighth of July, he encamped within ten
miles of Fort du Que&s;ne. Though Colonel Dunbar was
then near forty miles behind him, and his officers, particu|larly
Sir Peter Halket, earne&s;tly entreated him to proceed
with caution, and to employ the friendly Indians who
were with him, by way of advanced guard, in ca&s;e of am|bu&s;cades;
yet he re&s;umed his march the next day, without
&s;o much as endeavouring to obtain any intelligence of the
&s;ituation or di&s;po&s;ition of the enemy, or even &s;ending out
any &s;couts to vi&s;it the woods and thickets on both &s;ides of
<PB N="413" REF="421">
him, as well as in his front. With this carele&s;&s;ne&s;s he was
advancing, when, about noon, he was &s;aluted with a ge|neral
fire upon his front, and all along his left flank, from
an enemy &s;o artfully concealed behind the trees and bu&s;hes,
that not a man of them could be &s;een. The vanguard im|mediately
fell back upon the main body, and in an in&s;tant
the panick and confu&s;ion became general; &s;o that mo&s;t
of the troops fled with great precipitation, notwith&s;tand|ing
all that their officers, &s;ome of whom behaved very gal|lantly,
could do to &s;top their career. As to Braddock
him&s;elf, in&s;tead of &s;couring the thickets and bu&s;hes from
whence the fire came, with grape &s;hot from the ten pieces
of cannon he had with him, or ordering flanking parties of
his Indians to advance again&s;t the enemy, he ob&s;tinately
remained upon the &s;pot where he was, and gave orders for
the few brave officers and men who &s;taid with him, to
form regularly, and advance. Mean while his men fell
thick about him, and almo&s;t all his officers were &s;ingled out,
one after another, and killed or wounded; for the Indians,
who always take aim when they fire, and aim chiefly at
the officers, di&s;tingui&s;hed them by their dre&s;s. At la&s;t, the
general, who&s;e ob&s;tinacy &s;eemed to increa&s;e with the dan|ger,
after having had &s;ome hor&s;es &s;hot under him, received
a mu&s;ket-&s;hot through the right arm and lungs, of which
he died in a few hours, having been carried off the field by
the bravery of Lieutenant-Colonel Gage, and another of
his officers. When he dropped, the confu&s;ion of the few
that remained turned it into a downright and very di&s;orderly
flight acro&s;s a river which they had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, though no
enemy appeared, or attempted to attack them. All the
artillery, ammunition, and baggage of the army were left
to the enemy, and, among the re&s;t, the General's cabinet,
with all his letters and in&s;tructions, which the French
court afterwards made great u&s;e of in their printed memo|rials
or manife&s;toes. The lo&s;s of the Engli&s;h in this un|happy
affair amounted to &s;even hundred men. Their
officers, in particular, &s;uffered much more than in the or|dinary
proportion of battles in Europe. Sir Peter Halket
<PB N="414" REF="422">
fell by the very fir&s;t fire, at the head of his regiment; and
the General's &s;ecretary, &s;on to Governor Shirley, was
killed &s;oon after. Neither the number of men which the
enemy had in this engagement, nor the lo&s;s which they had
&s;u&s;tained, could be &s;o much as gue&s;&s;ed at: but the French
afterwards gave out, that their number did not, in the
whole, exceed four hundred men, mo&s;tly Indians; and
that their lo&s;s was quite incon&s;iderable, as it probably was,
becau&s;e they lay concealed in &s;uch a manner that the Engli&s;h
knew not whither to point their mu&s;kets. The panick
of the&s;e la&s;t continued &s;o long, that they never &s;topped till
they met the rear divi&s;ion; and even then they infected
tho&s;e troops with their terrours; &s;o that the army retreated
without &s;topping, till they reached Fort Cumberland,
though the enemy did not &s;o much as attempt to pur&s;ue,
nor ever appeared in &s;ight, either in the battle, or after
the defeat. On the whole, this was perhaps the mo&s;t ex|traordinary
victory that ever was obtained, and the far|the&s;t
flight that ever was made.</P>
<P>&sect; X. Had the &s;hattered remains of this army continued
at fort Cumberland, and fortified them&s;elves there, as they
might ea&s;ily have done during the re&s;t of the &s;ummer, they
would have been &s;uch a check upon the French and their
&s;calping Indians, as would have prevented many of tho&s;e
ravages that were committed in the en&s;uing winter upon
the we&s;tern borders of Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania; but,
in&s;tead of taking that prudent &s;tep, their commander left
only the &s;ick and wounded at that fort, under the protection
of two companies of the provincial militia, po&s;ted there by
way of garri&s;on, and began his march on the &s;econd of
Augu&s;t, with about &s;ixteen hundred men, from Philadel|phia;
where tho&s;e troops could be of no immediate &s;ervice.
From thence they were ordered away to Albany, in New-York,
by General Shirley, on whom the chief command
of the troops in America had devolved by the death of
Major-General Braddock. Virginia, Maryland, and
Penn&s;ylvania, were by the&s;e means left entirely to take
care of them&s;elves, which they might have done effectually,
<PB N="415" REF="423">
had they been united in their councils: but the u&s;ual di&s;|putes,
between their governors and a&s;&s;emblies, defeated
every &s;alutary plan that was propo&s;ed. Penn&s;ylvania, the
mo&s;t powerful of the three, was rendered quite impotent,
either for its own defence, or that of its neighbours, by
the&s;e unhappy conte&s;ts; though, at la&s;t, the a&s;&s;embly of
that province, &s;en&s;ible of the danger to which they were
expo&s;ed, and &s;eeing the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of providing a
&s;tanding military force, and of erecting &s;ome forts to de|fend
their we&s;tern frontier, pa&s;&s;ed a bill for rai&s;ing fifty
thou&s;and pounds. But even this &s;um, &s;mall as it was,
even to a degree of ridicule, con&s;idering the richne&s;s of the
province, and the extent of its frontier, could not be ob|tained;
the governor po&s;itively refu&s;ing to give his a&s;&s;ent
to the act of the a&s;&s;embly, becau&s;e they had taxed the
proprietaries e&s;tates equally with tho&s;e of the inhabitants,
which he &s;aid, he was ordered by his in&s;tructions not to
con&s;ent to, nor indeed any new tax upon the proprieta|ries;
and the a&s;&s;embly, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of members who&s;e
e&s;tates lay in the ea&s;tern or interior parts of the province,
as po&s;itively refu&s;ing to alter their bill. One would be
apt to think, that, in ca&s;e of &s;uch urgent nece&s;&s;ity, the
governor might have ventured to give his a&s;&s;ent to the
bill under a prote&s;t, that it &s;hould not prejudice the rights
of the proprietaries upon any foture occa&s;ion: but as he
did not, the bill was dropped, and the province left defen&s;e|le&s;s;
by which means it afterwards &s;uffered &s;everely, to the
de&s;truction of many of the poor inhabitants upon the we&s;t|ern
frontier, and to the impre&s;&s;ing the Indians with a con|temptible
opinion of the Engli&s;h, and the highe&s;t e&s;teem of
the French.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. Our colonies to the north of Penn&s;ylvania were more
active, and more &s;ucce&s;sful in their preparations for war.
New-York, following the example of New-England, pa&s;&s;|ed
an act to prohibit the &s;ending of provi&s;ions to any French
port or &s;ettlement on the continent of North-America,
or any of the adjacent i&s;lands; and al&s;o for rai&s;ing forty-five
thou&s;and pounds, on e&s;tates real and per&s;onal, for the better
<PB N="416" REF="424">
defence of their colony, which lay more expo&s;ed than any
other to a French inva&s;ion from Crown-Point. However,
this &s;um, great as it might &s;eem to them, was far from be|ing
&s;ufficient; nor, indeed, could they have provided proper|ly
for their &s;ecurity, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our other co|lonies
to the ea&s;t of them; but with their help, and the ad|ditional
&s;uccour of the &s;mall body of regular troops expected
under Colonel Dunbar, they boldly re&s;olved upon offen&s;ive
mea&s;ures, which, when practicable, are always the &s;afe&s;t;
and two expeditions, one again&s;t the French fort at Crown-Point,
and the other again&s;t their fort at Niagara, between
the lakes Ontario and Erie, were &s;et on foot at the &s;ame
time. The former of the&s;e expeditions was appointed to
be executed under the command of General John&s;on, a
native of Ireland, who had long re&s;ided upon the Mohock
river, in the we&s;tern parts of New-York, where he had
acquired a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, and was univer&s;ally be|loved,
not only by the inhabitants, but al&s;o by the neigh|bouring
Indians, who&s;e language he had learnt, and who&s;e
affections he had gained by his humanity towards them.
The expedition again&s;t Niagara was commanded by Ge|neral
Shirley him&s;elf.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. The rendezvous of the troops for both the&s;e ex|peditions
was appointed to be at Albany, where mo&s;t of
them arrived before the end of June: but the artillery,
batteaux, provi&s;ions, and other nece&s;&s;aries for the attempt
upon Crown-Point, could not be prepared till the eighth
of Augu&s;t, when General John&s;on &s;et out with them from
Albany for the Carrying place from Hud&s;on's river to
Lake-George. There the troops had already arrived, un|der
the command of Major-General Lyman, and con&s;i&s;ted
of between five and &s;ix thou&s;and men, be&s;ides Indians,
rai&s;ed by the governments of Bo&s;ton, Connecticut, New-Hamp&s;hire,
Rhode-I&s;land, and New-York. Every thing
was then prepared as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible for a march; and to|wards
the end of the month, General John&s;on advanced
about fourteen miles forward with his troops, and encamped
in a very &s;trong &s;ituation, covered on each &s;ide by a thick
<PB N="417" REF="425">
wooded &s;wamp, by Lake George in his rear, and by a
brea&s;t-work of trees, cut down for that purpo&s;e, in his
front. Here he re&s;olved to wait the arrival of his batteaux,
and afterwards to proceed to Ticonderoga, at the other end
of the lake, from whence it was but about fifteen miles to
the fort at the &s;outh end of Lake Corlaer, or Champlain,
called Fort-Frederick by the French, and by us Crown-Point.
Whil&s;t he was thus encamped, &s;ome of his Indian
&s;couts, of which he took care to &s;end out numbers along
both &s;ides, and to the farther end of Lake-George,
brought him intelligence that a con&s;iderable number of the
enemy were then on their march from Ticonderoga, by the
way of the &s;outh bay, towards the fortified encampment,
&s;ince called Fort-Edward, which General Lyman had
built at the Carrying-place, and in which four or five hun|dred
of the New-Hamp&s;hire and New-York men had been
left as a garri&s;on. Upon this information General John|&s;on
&s;ent two expre&s;&s;es, one after the other, to Colonel
Blanchard, their commander, with orders to call in all his
out-parties, and to keep his whole force within the en|trenchments.
About twelve o'clock at night, tho&s;e who
had been &s;ent upon the &s;econd expre&s;s returned with an
account of their having &s;een the enemy within four miles
of the camp at the Carrying-place, which they &s;carcely
doubted their having by that time attacked. Important as
the defence of this place was for the &s;afety of the whole
army, and imminent as the danger &s;eemed to be, it does
not appear that the General then called any council of war,
or re&s;olved upon any thing for its relief: but early the next
morning he called a council, wherein it was unadvi&s;edly
re&s;olved to detach a thou&s;and men, with a number of In|dians,
to intercept, or, as the General's expre&s;&s;ion was in
his letter, to catch the enemy in their retreat, either as
victors, or as defeated in their de&s;ign. This expedient
was re&s;olved on, though no one knew the number of the
enemy, nor could obtain any information in that re&s;pect
from the Indian &s;couts, becau&s;e the Indians have no words
$or &s;igns for expre&s;&s;ing any large number, which, when it
<PB N="418" REF="426">
exceeds their reckoning, they &s;ignify by pointing to the
&s;tars in the firmament, or to the hair of the head; and this
they often do to denote a number le&s;s than a thou&s;and, as
well as to &s;ignify ten thou&s;and, or any greater number.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning
a thou&s;and men, with two hundred Indians, were detached
under the command of Colonel Williams: but they had
not been gone two hours, when tho&s;e in the camp began to
hear a clo&s;e firing, at about three or four miles di&s;tance, as
they judged: as it approached nearer and nearer, they
rightly &s;uppo&s;ed that their detachment was overpowered,
and retreating towards the camp; which was &s;oon con|firmed
by &s;ome fugitives, and pre&s;ently after by whole com|panies,
who fled back in great confu&s;ion. In a very &s;hort
time after, the enemy appeared marching in regular order
up to the centre of the camp, where the con&s;ternation was
&s;o great, that, if they had attacked the brea&s;t-work directly,
they might probably have thrown all into confu&s;ion, and
obtained an ea&s;y victory: but, fortunately for the Engli&s;h,
they halted for &s;ome time about an hundred and fifty yards
di&s;tance, and from thence began their attack with platoon
firing, too far off to do much hurt, e&s;pecially again&s;t troops
who were defended by a &s;trong brea&s;t-work. On the con|trary,
this ineffectual fire &s;erved only to rai&s;e the &s;pirits of
the&s;e la&s;t, who, having prepared their artillery during the
time that the French halted, began to play it &s;o bri&s;kly
upon the enemy, that the Canadians and Indians in their
&s;ervice fled immediately into the woods on each &s;ide of the
camp, and there &s;quatted under bu&s;hes, or &s;kulked behind
trees, from whence they continued firing with very little
execution, mo&s;t of their &s;hot being intercepted by the
brakes and thickets, for they never had the courage to ad|vance
to the verge of the wood. Baron Die&s;kau, who
commanded the French, being thus left alone, with hi$
regular troops, at the front of the camp, finding he could
not make a clo&s;e attack upon the centre with his &s;mal$
number of men, moved fir&s;t to the left, and then to the
right, at both which places he endeavoured to force a pa&s;|&s;age,
<PB N="419" REF="427">
but was repul&s;ed, being un&s;upported by the irregu|lars.
In&s;tead of retreating, as he ought in prudence to have
done, he &s;till continued his platoon and bu&s;h-firing till
four o'clock in the afternoon, during which time his regu|lar
troops &s;uffered greatly by the fire from the camp, and
were at la&s;t thrown into confu&s;ion; which was no &s;ooner
perceived by General John&s;on's men, than they, without
waiting for orders, leaped over their brea&s;t-work, attacked
the enemy on all &s;ides, and, after killing or taking a con&s;i|derable
number of them, entirely di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t. The
French, who&s;e numbers, at the beginning of this engage|ment,
amounted to about two thou&s;and men, including
two hundred grenadiers, eight hundred Canadians, and the
re&s;t Indians of different nations, had between &s;even and
eight hundred men killed, and thirty taken pri&s;oners:
among the latter was Baron Die&s;kau him&s;elf, whom they
found at a little di&s;tance from the field of battle, danger|ou&s;ly
wounded, and leaning on the &s;tump of a tree for his
&s;upport. The Engli&s;h lo&s;t about two hundred men, and
tho&s;e chiefly of the detachment under Colonel Williams;
for they had very few either killed or wounded in the attack
upon their camp, and not any of di&s;tinction, except Colonel
Titcomb killed, and the General him&s;elf and Major Ni|chols
wounded. Among the &s;lain of the detachment,
which would probably have been entirely cut off, had not
Lieutenant-Colonel Cole been &s;ent out from the camp
with three hundred men, with which he &s;topped the enemy's
pur&s;uit, and covered the retreat of his friends, were Colonel
Williams, Major A&s;hley, &s;ix captains, and &s;everal &s;ubal|terns,
be&s;ides private men; and the Indians reckoned that
they had lo&s;t forty men, be&s;ides the brave old Hendrick,
the Mohock Sachem, or chief captain.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. When Baron Die&s;kau &s;et out from Ticon|deroga,
his de&s;ign was only to &s;urpri&s;e and cut off the en|trenched
camp, now called Fort-Edward, at the Carrying-place,
where there were but four or five hundred men. If
he had executed this &s;cheme, our army would have been
thrown into great difficulties, for it could neither have
<PB N="420" REF="428">
proceeded farther, nor have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted where it was, and he
might have found an opportunity to attack it with great
advantage in its retreat. But when he was within four or
five miles of that fort, his people were informed that there
were &s;everal cannon there, and none at the camp; upon
which they all de&s;ired to be led on to this la&s;t, which he the
more readily con&s;ented to, as he him&s;elf had been told by
an Engli&s;h pri&s;oner, who had left this camp but a few days
before, that it was quite defencele&s;s, being without any
lines, and de&s;titute of cannon; which, in effect, was true
at that time, for the cannon did not arrive, nor was the
brea&s;t-work erected, till about two days before the engage|ment.
To this mi&s;information, therefore, mu&s;t be im|puted
this &s;tep, which would otherwi&s;e be incon&s;i&s;tent with
the general character and abilities of Baron Die&s;kau. A
le&s;s ju&s;tifiable error &s;eems to have been committed by Gen.
John&s;on, in not detaching a party to pur&s;ue the enemy
when they were defeated and fled. Perhaps he was pre|vented
from &s;o doing by the ill fate of the detachment he
had &s;ent out in the morning under Colonel Williams.
However that may be, his neglect, in this re&s;pect, had like
to have been fatal the next day to a detachment &s;ent from
Fort-Edward, con&s;i&s;ting of an hundred and twenty men
of the New-Hamp&s;hire regiment, under Captain M'Gin|nes,
as a re-enforcement to the army at the camp. This
party fell in with between three and four hundred men of
Die&s;kau's troops, near the &s;pot where Colonel Williams
had been defeated the day before; but M'Ginnes having
timely notice by his &s;couts of the approach of an enemy,
made &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition, that he not only repul&s;ed the a&s;|&s;ailants,
but defeated and entirely di&s;per&s;ed them, with the
lo&s;s only of two men killed, eleven wounded, and five
mi&s;&s;ing. He him&s;elf unfortunately died of the wounds he
received in this engagement, a few days after he arrived at
the camp with his party.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. It was now judged too late in the year to proceed
to the attack of Crown-Point, as it would have been ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
in that ca&s;e, to build a &s;trong fort in the place
<PB N="421" REF="429">
where the camp then was, in order to &s;ecure a communi|cation
with Albany, from whence only the troops could
expect to be re-enforced, or &s;upplied with fre&s;h &s;tores of am|munition
or provi&s;ions. They, therefore, &s;et out upon their
return &s;oon after this engagement, having fir&s;t erected a
little &s;tockaded fort, at the hither end of Lake George, in
which they left a &s;mall garri&s;on, as a future prey for the
enemy; a misfortune which might ea&s;ily have been fore|&s;een,
becau&s;e this whole army, being country militia, was
to be di&s;banded, and return to their re&s;pective homes, as
they actually did &s;oon after their retreat to Albany.
This was all the glory, this all the advantage, that the
Engli&s;h nation acquired by &s;uch an expen&s;ive expedition.
But &s;o little had the Engli&s;h been accu&s;tomed of late to
hear of victory, that they rejoiced at this advantage, as if
it had been an action of the greate&s;t con&s;equence. The
general was highly applauded for his conduct, and libe|rally
rewarded; for he was created a baronet by his Ma|je&s;ty,
and pre&s;ented with five thou&s;and pounds by the par|liament.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. The preparations for General Shirley's ex|pedition
again&s;t Niagara were not only deficient, but
&s;hamefully &s;low; though it was well known that even the
po&s;&s;ibility of his &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, depend
upon his &s;etting out early in the year, as will appear to
any per&s;on that con&s;iders the &s;ituation of our fort at O&s;|wego,
this being the only way by which he could proceed
to Niagara. O&s;wego lies on the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ide of the
lake Ontario, near three hundred miles almo&s;t due-we&s;t from
Albany in New-York. The way to it from thence,
though long and tedious, is the more convenient, as the
far greate&s;t part of it admits of water-carriage, by what the
inhabitants call batteaux, which are a kind of light flat-bottomed
boats, wide&s;t in the middle, and pointed at each
end, of about fifteen hundred weight burthen, and ma|naged
by two men, called batteau men, with paddles and
&s;etting poles, the rivers being in many places too narrow
to admit of oars. From Albany to the village of Shenect|ady,
<PB N="422" REF="430">
about &s;ixteen miles, is a good waggon-road. From
thence to the little Falls in the Mohock river, being &s;ixty-five
miles, the pa&s;&s;age is by water-carriage up that river,
and con&s;equently again&s;t the &s;tream, which in many
places is &s;omewhat rapid, and in others &s;o &s;hallow, that,
when the river is low, the watermen are obliged to get
out, and draw their batteaux over the rifts. At the little
Falls is a po&s;tage, or land carriage, for about a mile,
over a ground &s;o mar&s;hy, that it will not bear any wheel-carriage:
but a colony of Germans, &s;ettled there, attend
with &s;ledges, on which they draw the loaded batteaux to
the next place of embarkation upon the &s;ame river. From
thence they proceed by water up that river, for fifty miles,
to the Carrying-place, near the head of it, where there is
another po&s;tage, the length of which depends upon the
dryne&s;s or wetne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, but is generally above
&s;ix or eight miles over in the &s;ummer months. Here the
batteaux are again carried upon &s;ledges, till they come to
a narrow river called Wood's Creek, down which they
are wafted on a gentle &s;tream, for about forty miles, into
the lake Oneyada, which &s;tretches from ea&s;t to we&s;t about
thirty miles, and is pa&s;&s;ed with great ea&s;e and &s;afety in cal$
weather. At the we&s;tern end of this lake is the river
Onondaga, which, after a cour&s;e of between twenty and
thirty miles, unites with the river Cayuga, or Seneca$
and their united &s;treams run into the lake Ontario, at th$
place where O&s;wego-fort is &s;ituated. But this river is $word$
rapid as to be &s;ometimes dangerous, be&s;ides its being $word$
of rifts and rocks; and about twelve miles on this &s;ide $word$
O&s;wego there is a fall of eleven $eet perpendicular, whe$
there is con&s;equently a po&s;tage, which, however, does $word$
exceed forty yards. From thence the pa&s;&s;age is ea&s;y quit$$
to O&s;wego. The lake Ontario, on which this fort &s;tand$
is near two hundred and eighty leagues in circumference$
its figure is oval, and its depth runs from twenty to twenty-five
fathoms. On the north &s;ide of it are &s;everal littl$
gulfs. There is a communication between this lake an$
that of the Hurons by the river Tana&s;uate, from whenc$
<PB N="423" REF="431">
it is a land carriage of &s;ix or eight leagues to the river To|ronto,
which falls into it. The French have two forts of
con&s;equence on this lake; Frontenac, which commands
the river St. Laurence, where the lake communicates with
it; and Niagara, which commands the communication
between the lake Ontario and the lake Erie. But of the&s;e
forts, and this la&s;t lake, which is one of the fine&s;t in the
world, we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak hereafter.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. Though we had long been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
fort O&s;wego, and though it lay greatly expo&s;ed to the
French, particularly to tho&s;e of Canada, upon any rupture
between the two nations, we had never taken care to render
it tolerably defen&s;ible, or even to build a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el fit for
navigating the lake: nor was this &s;trange neglect ever
taken effectual notice of, till the beginning of this year,
when, at a meeting which General Braddock had in April
with the governors and chief gentlemen of &s;everal of our
colonies, at Alexandria, in Virginia, it was re&s;olved to
&s;trengthen both the fort and garri&s;on at O&s;wego, and to
build &s;ome large ve&s;&s;els at that place. Accordingly, a
number of &s;hipwrights and workmen were &s;ent thither in
May and June. At the &s;ame time Captain Brad&s;treet
marched thither, with two companies of an hundred men
each, to re-enforce the hundred that were there before
under Captain King, to which number the garri&s;on had
been increa&s;ed &s;ince our conte&s;ts with France began to
grow &s;erious. For a long time before, not above twenty-five
men were left to defend this po&s;t, which from its
great importance, and the &s;ituation of affairs at this junc|ture,
mo&s;t certainly required a much &s;tronger garri&s;on
than was put into it even at this juncture: but oeconomy
was the chief thing con&s;ulted in the beginning of this
war, and to that, in a great mea&s;ure, was owing its long
duration.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. From the above de&s;cription of the pa&s;&s;age from
Albany to O&s;wego, it is plain how nece&s;&s;ary it was that
the troops intended for this expedition &s;hould have &s;et out
early in the &s;pring. But, in&s;tead of that, the very fir&s;t of
<PB N="424" REF="432">
them, Colonel Schuyler's New-Jer&s;ey regiment, did not
begin their march till after the beginning of July; and
ju&s;t as Shirley's and Pepperell's regiments were preparing
to follow, the melancholy account of Braddock's di&s;a&s;|ter
arrived at Albany, where it &s;o damped the &s;pirits of
the people, and &s;pread &s;uch a terror, that many of the
troops de&s;erted, and mo&s;t of the batteau men di&s;per&s;ed,
and ran home, by which means even all the nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores
could not be carried along with the troops. Notwith&s;tand|ing
this di&s;appointment, General Shirley &s;et out from Al|bany
before the end of July, with as many of the troops
and &s;tores as he could procure a conveyance for, hoping
to be joined in his route by great numbers of the Indians
of the Six Nations, to whom he &s;ent invitations to that
effect as he pa&s;&s;ed by their &s;ettlements: but they, in&s;tead
of complying with his de&s;ire, ab&s;olutely declared again&s;t
all ho&s;tilities on that &s;ide of the country; and in&s;i&s;ted
that O&s;wego, being a place of traffick and peace, ought
not to be di&s;turbed either by the Engli&s;h or the French,
as if they could have per&s;uaded both parties to agree to
&s;uch a local truce. Upon this refu&s;al, Mr. Shirley pro|ceeded
forward, being joined by very few Indians, and ar|rived
at O&s;wego on the &s;eventeenth or eighteenth of Augu&s;t;
but the re&s;t of the troops and artillery did not arrive till the
la&s;t day of that month: and, even then, their &s;tore of pro|vi&s;ions
was not &s;ufficient to enable them to proceed again&s;t
Niagara, though &s;ome tolerable good ve&s;&s;els had by this
time been built and got ready for that purpo&s;e. The ge|neral
now re&s;olved to take but &s;ix hundred men with him
for the attack of Niagara, and leave the re&s;t of his army,
con&s;i&s;ting of about fourteen hundred more, at O&s;wego, to
defend that place, in ca&s;e the French &s;hould attack it in
his ab&s;ence, which there was rea&s;on to apprehend they
might, as they had then a con&s;iderable force at Fort Fron|tenac,
from whence they could ea&s;ily cro&s;s over the lake
Ontario to O&s;wego. However, he was &s;till obliged to
wait at O&s;wego for provi&s;ions, of which at length a &s;mall
&s;upply arrived on the twenty-&s;ixth of September, barely
<PB N="425" REF="433">
&s;ufficient to &s;upport his men during their intended ex|pedition,
and to allow twelve days &s;hort &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for
tho&s;e he left behind. But by this time the rainy boi&s;te|rous
&s;ea&s;on had begun, on which account mo&s;t of his
Indians had already left him, and were returned home;
and the few that remained with him declared that there
was no cro&s;&s;ing the lake Ontario in batteaux at that &s;ea&s;on,
or any time before next &s;ummer. In this perplexity
he called a council of war, which, after weighing all cir|cum&s;tances,
unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to defer the attempt
upon Niagara till the next year, and to employ the troops,
whil&s;t they remained at O&s;wego, in building barracks,
and erecting, or at lea&s;t beginning to erect, two new forts,
one on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river$ Onondaga, four hundred
and fifty yards di&s;tant from the old fort, which it was to
command, as well as the entrance of the harbour, and to
be called Ontario-fort; and the other four hundred and
fifty yards we&s;t of the old fort, to be called O&s;wego new
fort.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. The&s;e things being agreed on, General Shirley,
with the greate&s;t part of the troops under his command,
&s;et out on his return to Albany on the twenty-fourth of
October, leaving Colonel Mercer, with a garri&s;on of
about &s;even hundred men, at O&s;wego; though repeated
advice had been received, that the French had then at lea&s;t
a thou&s;and men at their fort of Frontenac, upon the &s;ame
lake: and, what was &s;till wor&s;e, the new forts were not
yet near completed; but left to be fini&s;hed by the hard
labour of Colonel Mercer and his little garri&s;on, with the
addition of this melancholy circum&s;tance, that, if be&s;ieged
by the enemy in the winter, it would not be po&s;&s;ible for
his friends to come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Thus ended this
year's unfortunate campaign, during which the French,
with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Indian allies, continued their
murthers, &s;calping, captivating, and laying wa&s;te the
we&s;tern frontiers of Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania, during
the whole winter.</P>
<P><PB N="426" REF="434">
&sect; XX. The mini&s;ters of the two jarring powers were
very bu&s;ily employed this year at mo&s;t of the courts of
Europe; but their tran&s;actions were kept extremely &s;ecret.
The French endeavoured to in&s;pire the Spaniards with
a jealou&s;y of the &s;trength of the Engli&s;h by &s;ea, e&s;pecially
in America; and the Spani&s;h court &s;eemed inclined to
accept of the office of mediator: but Mr. Wall, who was
perfectly well acquainted with the &s;tate of affairs between
England and France, &s;econded the repre&s;entations of the
Briti&s;h mini&s;try, which demon&s;trated, that, however wil|ling
Great-Britain might be to accept of the mediation
of Spain, &s;he could not agree to any &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms
in America, which France in&s;i&s;ted on as a preliminary
condition, without hazarding the whole of her intere&s;t
there; and that the captures which had been made by
the Engli&s;h were the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the encroach|ments
and inju&s;tice of the French, particularly in that
country. Upon this remon&s;trance, all further talk of
the mediation of Spain was dropped, and the mini&s;try of
Ver&s;ailles had recour&s;e to the princes of Germany;
among&s;t whom the Elector of Cologn was &s;oon brought
over to their party, &s;o as to con&s;ent to their forming maga|zines
in his territories in We&s;tphalia. This was a plain
indication of their de&s;ign again&s;t Hanover, which they
&s;oon after made his Britannick Maje&s;ty, who was then at
Hanover, an offer of &s;paring, if he would agree to certain
conditions of neutrality for that electorate, which he re|jected
with di&s;dain. Then the Count D'Aubeterre, envoy
extraordinary from France at the court of Vienna, pro|po&s;ed
a &s;ecret negociation with the mini&s;ters of the Empre&s;s-Queen.
The &s;ecret articles of the treaty of Peter&s;burgh,
between the two empre&s;&s;es, had &s;tipulated a kind of par|tition
of the Pru&s;&s;ian territories, in ca&s;e that prince &s;hould
infringe the treaty of Dre&s;den; but his Britannick Ma|je&s;ty,
though often invited, had always refu&s;ed to agree
to any &s;uch &s;tipulation; and the King of Poland, how&s;o|ever
he might be inclined to favour the &s;cheme, did not
dare to avow it formally, till matters &s;hould be more ripe
<PB N="427" REF="435">
for carrying it into execution. The court of Vienna,
who&s;e favourite mea&s;ure this was, began to li&s;ten to
D'Aubeterre's in&s;inuations, and by degrees entered into
negotiations with him, which, in the end, were produc|tive
of that unnatural confederacy between the Empre&s;s-Queen
and the King of France, of which further notice
will be taken in the occurrences of the next year, when
the treaty between them, into which they afterwards $ound
means &s;ecretly to bring the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, was con|cluded
at Ver&s;ailles.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The King of England taking it for granted
that the French would invade Hanover, in con&s;equence
of their rupture with Great-Britain, which &s;eemed to be
near at hand, began to take mea&s;ures for the defence of that
electorate. To this end, during his &s;tay at Hanover, he
concluded, on the eighteenth of June, a treaty with the
Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, by which his &s;erene highne&s;s en|gaged
to hold in readine&s;s, during four years, for his Ma|je&s;ty's
&s;ervice, a body of eight thou&s;and men, to be em|ployed,
if required, upon the continent, or in Britain or
Ireland; but not on board the fleet, or beyond the &s;eas:
and al&s;o, if his Britannick Maje&s;ty &s;hould judge it nece&s;|&s;ary
or advantageous for his &s;ervice, to furni&s;h and join to
this body of eight thou&s;and men, within &s;ix months after
they &s;hould be demanded, four thou&s;and more, of which
&s;even hundred were to be hor&s;e or dragoons, and each regi|ment
of infantry to have two field pieces of cannon<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The King, on his &s;ide, promi&s;ed to pay to the Landgrave for the&s;e &s;uc|cours, eighty crowns banco, by way of levy-money, for every trooper or dragoon duly armed and mounted, and thirty crowns banco for every foot &s;oldier; the crown to be reckoned at fifty-three $ols of Holland, or at four &s;hillings and nine pence three farthings Engli&s;h money; and al&s;o to pay to his &s;erene highne&s;s; for the eight thou&s;and men, an annual &s;ub&s;idy of an hundred and fifty thou&s;and crowns banco, during the four years, to com|mence from the day of &s;igning the treaty; which &s;ub&s;idy was to be increa&s;|ed to three hundred thou&s;and crowns yearly from the time of requiring the troops to the time of their entering into Briti&s;h pay; and in ca&s;e of their being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, the &s;aid &s;ub&s;idy of three hundred thou&s;and crowns was then to revive and be continued during the re&s;idue of the term; but if twelve thou&s;and men were demanded and furni&s;hed, the &s;ub&s;idy was then to be increa&s;ed in proportion; and in ca&s;e the King of Great-Britain &s;hould at any time think fit to &s;end back the&s;e troops, before the expiration of the treaty, notice thereof was to be given to his &s;erene highne&s;s three months be|forehand; one month's pay was to be allowed them for their return, and they were to be furni&s;hed gratis with the nece&s;&s;ary tran&s;port ve&s;&s;els.</NOTE>.
<PB N="428" REF="436">
Another treaty was begun with Ru&s;&s;ia about the &s;ame
time; but this did not take effect during his Maje&s;ty's
re&s;idence at Hanover: that others were not concluded
was the more &s;urpri&s;ing, as our &s;ub&s;idy treaty with Saxony
had then expired, and that with Bavaria was near expiring,
and as the &s;ecuring of the&s;e two princes in our intere&s;t was
at lea&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary towards forming a &s;ufficient con$ede|racy
upon the continent for the defence of Hanover, as it
was to &s;ecure the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el. If the rea&s;on
of their not being engaged, and no other &s;eems &s;o proba|ble,
was, that they refu&s;ed to renew their treaties with
England upon any terms, all that can be &s;aid is, that they
were guilty of flagrant ingratitude, as they had both re|ceived
a &s;ub&s;idy from this kingdom for many years in
time of peace, when they neither were nor could be of
any &s;ervice to the intere&s;t of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. On the fifteenth of July an expre&s;s arrived
from Admiral Bo&s;cawen, with an account of his having
taken the two French &s;hips of war, the Alcide and the
Lys. This was certainly contrary to the expectation of
the court of France; for had they apprehended any &s;uch
attack, they would not have ordered Mr. M'Namara to
return to Bre&s;t with the chief part of their &s;quadron;
nor was it, perhaps, le&s;s contrary to the expectation of
&s;ome of our own mini&s;try: but as matters had been car|ried
&s;o far, it was then too late to retreat; and, therefore,
orders were &s;oon after given to all our &s;hips of war to
make repri&s;als upon the French, by taking their &s;hips
whenever they &s;hould meet them. Sir Edward Hawke
$ailed from Port&s;mouth on the twenty-fir&s;t of July, with
eighteen &s;hips of war, to watch the return of the French
fleet from America, which, however, e&s;caped him, and
arrived at Bre&s;t on the third day of September. Commo|dore
<PB N="429" REF="437">
Frankland &s;ailed from Spithead for the We&s;t-Indies
on the thirteenth of Augu&s;t with four &s;hips of war, fur|ni&s;hed
with orders to commit ho&s;tilities, as well as to
protect our trade and &s;ugar-i&s;lands from any in&s;ult
that the French might offer; and the Duke de Mire|poix,
their amba&s;&s;ador at the court of London, &s;et out
for Paris on the twenty-&s;econd of July, without taking
leave.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. A war being thus in &s;ome mea&s;ure begun,
his Maje&s;ty thought proper, perhaps for that rea&s;on, to
return to his Briti&s;h dominions &s;ooner than u&s;ual; for he
left Hanover on the eighth of September, and arrived on
the fifteenth at Ken&s;ington, where the treaty of alliance
between him and the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, which he had
begun during his ab&s;ence, was concluded on the thirtieth
of the &s;ame month. By this treaty her Ru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty
engaged to hold in readine&s;s in Livonia, upon the frontiers
of Lithuania, a body of troops con&s;i&s;ting of forty thou&s;and
infantry, with the nece&s;&s;ary artillery, and fifteen thou|&s;and
cavalry; and al&s;o on the coa&s;ts of the &s;ame province,
forty or fifty galleys, with the nece&s;&s;ary crews; to be
ready to act, upon the fir&s;t order, in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice,
in ca&s;e, &s;aid the fifth article, which was the mo&s;t remark|able,
that the dominions of his Britannick Maje&s;ty in
Germany &s;hould be invaded on account of the intere&s;ts or
di&s;putes which regard his kingdoms; her Imperial Ma|je&s;ty
declaring that &s;he would look upon &s;uch an inva&s;ion
as a ca&s;e of the alliance of the year one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred
and forty-two; and that the &s;aid dominions &s;hould
be therein compri&s;ed in this re&s;pect: but neither the&s;e
troops nor gallies were to be put in motion, unle&s;s his
Britannick Maje&s;ty, or his allies, &s;hould be &s;omewhere
attacked; in which ca&s;e the Ru&s;&s;ian general &s;hould march,
as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after requi&s;ition, to make a diver&s;ion
with thirty thou&s;and infantry and fifteen thou&s;and cavalry:
and &s;hould embark on board the gallies the other ten thou|&s;and
infantry, to make a de&s;cent according to the exigency
of the affair. On the other &s;ide, his Britannick Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="430" REF="438">
engaged to pay to her Ru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty an annual &s;ub|&s;idy
of an hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling a-year, each year
to be paid in advance, and to be reckoned from the day of
the exchange of the ratifications, to the day that the&s;e troops
&s;hould upon requi&s;ition march out of Ru&s;&s;ia; from which
day the annual &s;ub&s;idy to her Imperial Maje&s;ty was to be
five hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, to be paid always
four months in advance, until the troops &s;hould return into
the Ru&s;&s;ian dominions, and for three months after their
return. His Britannick Maje&s;ty, who was to be at
liberty to &s;end once every year into the &s;aid province of
Livonia a commi&s;&s;ary, to &s;ee and examine the number and
condition of the &s;aid troops, further engaged, that, in ca&s;e
her Ru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty &s;hould be di&s;turbed in this diver&s;ion,
or attacked her&s;elf, he would furni&s;h immediately the &s;uc|cour
&s;tipulated in the treaty of one thou&s;and &s;even hundred
and forty-two; and that, in ca&s;e a war &s;hould break out,
he would &s;end into the Baltick a &s;quadron of his &s;hips, of a
force &s;uitable to the circum&s;tances. This was the chief
&s;ub&s;tance of the treaty, which, by agreement of both
parties, was to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for four years from the exchange of
the ratifications: but in the &s;eventh article the&s;e words
were unluckily in&s;erted: &startq;Con&s;idering al&s;o the proximity
of the countries wherein the diver&s;ion in que&s;tion will
probably be made, and the facility her troops will probably
have of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting immediately in an enemy's country,
&s;he takes upon her&s;elf alone, during &s;uch a diver&s;ion, the
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence and treatment of the &s;aid troops by &s;ea and
land.&endq; And in the eleventh article it was &s;tipulated, that
all the plunder the Ru&s;&s;ian army &s;hould take from the ene|my
&s;hould belong to them. That his Britannick Ma|je&s;ty,
who now knew enough of the court of Vienna to be
&s;en&s;ible that he could expect no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from thence, in
ca&s;e his German dominions were invaded, &s;hould enter into
this convention with the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, in order to
&s;trengthen his defence upon the continent, was extremely
natural; e&s;pecially as he had lately lived in great friend|&s;hip
with her, and her tran&s;actions with the court of France
<PB N="431" REF="439">
had been &s;o &s;ecret, by pa&s;&s;ing through only that of Vienna,
that he had not yet been informed of them; neither had the
project of the treaty of Ver&s;ailles then come to his know|ledge,
or to that of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, nor had either of
tho&s;e princes yet made any formal advances to the other.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. The fir&s;t intimation that appeared publickly
of the negociations of France with the Empre&s;s of Germa|ny,
was, when the French mini&s;ter, Count d'Aubeterre,
declared at Vienna, &startq;That the warlike de&s;igns with
which the King his ma&s;ter was charged, were &s;ufficiently
confuted by his great moderation, of which all Europe
had manifold proofs: that his Maje&s;ty was per&s;uaded
this groundle&s;s charge had given as much indignation
to their Imperial Maje&s;ties as to him&s;elf: that he was
firmly re&s;olved to pre&s;erve to Chri&s;tendom that tran|quillity
which it enjoyed through his good faith, in re|ligiou&s;ly
ob&s;erving the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle: but
that if his Britannick Maje&s;ty's allies &s;hould take part
in the war which was kindled in America, by furni&s;h|ing
&s;uccours to the Engli&s;h, his Maje&s;ty would be au|thori&s;ed
to con&s;ider and treat them as principals in it.&endq;
France likewi&s;e made the &s;ame declaration to other courts.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. The words and &s;tipulation in the above re|cited
clau&s;e, in the &s;eventh article of the treaty of Great-Britain
with Ru&s;&s;ia, were looked on as a menace levelled at
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who, having &s;ome time after found
means to procure a copy of this treaty, and &s;eeing it in that
light, boldly declared, by his mini&s;ters at all the Courts of
Europe, that he would oppo&s;e with his utmo&s;t force the
entrance of any foreign troops into the empire, under any
pretence whatever. This declaration was particularly
di&s;plea&s;ing to the French, who had already marched large
bodies of troops towards the frontiers of the empire, and
erected &s;everal great magazines in We&s;tphalia, with the
permi&s;&s;ion of the Elector of Cologn, for which the Engli&s;h
mini&s;ter at his court was, in Augu&s;t, ordered to withdraw
from thence without taking leave. However, as &s;oon as
this declaration of the King of Pur&s;&s;ia was notified to the
<PB N="432" REF="440">
court of Ver&s;ailles, they &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary,
the Duke de Nivernois, to Berlin, to try to per&s;uade his
Maje&s;ty to retract his declaration, and enter into a new
alliance with them. His Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty received this
amba&s;&s;ador in &s;uch a manner as &s;eemed to denote a di&s;po|&s;ition
to agree to every thing he had to propo&s;e. This
awakened in England a jealou&s;y that his declaration alone
was not to be relied on, but that it was nece&s;&s;ary to bring
him under &s;ome &s;olemn engagement; e&s;pecially as the
French had by this time a numerous army near the Lower
Rhine, with magazines provided for their march all the
way to Hanover; and if the King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;uffered them
to pa&s;s through his dominion, that electorate mu&s;t be &s;wal|lowed
up before the Ru&s;&s;ian auxiliaries could po&s;&s;ibly be
brought thither, or any army be formed for protecting it.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Perhaps the Elector of H&mdash;was more afraid of the P&mdash;n monarch than of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, knowing with what ea&s;e and rapidity this enterpri&s;ing neighbour could in a few days &s;ubdue the whole electorate.</NOTE>.
For this rea&s;on a negociation was &s;et on foot by Great-Britain
at Berlin; but as it was not concluded before the
beginning of the next year, we &s;hall defer entering into
the particulars of it, till we come to that period.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. Mean while the French made another attempt
upon the Court of Madrid, loudly complaining of the
taking of their two men of war by Bo&s;cawen's &s;quadron,
before any declaration of war was made, repre&s;enting
it as a mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable proceeding, which threatened a
di&s;&s;olution of all faith among&s;t nations. This procuced a
&s;trong memorial from Sir Benjamin Keene, our mini&s;ter at
that court, importing, &startq;That it was well known that the
French fleet carried troops, ammunition, and every thing
nece&s;&s;ary for defending the countries which the French
had unju&s;tly u&s;urped in America, and of which the Eng|li&s;h
claimed the property: that the rules of &s;elf-defence
authori&s;e every nation to render fruitle&s;s any attempt
that may tend to its prejudice: that this right had been
made u&s;e of only in taking the two French &s;hips of war;
and that the di&s;tinction of place might be interpreted in
favour of the Engli&s;h, &s;eeing the two &s;hips were taken on
<PB N="433" REF="441">
the coa&s;ts of the countries where the conte&s;t aro&s;e.&endq; In
an&s;wer to this ob&s;ervation, the French mini&s;ter repre&s;ent|ed
the va&s;t number of &s;hips that had been taken in the Eu|ropean
&s;eas; for in $act the Engli&s;h ports &s;oon began to
be filled with them, in con&s;equence of the general orders
for making repri&s;als. But the court of Madrid was &s;o far
from being per&s;uaded by any thing he could &s;ay, that it
gave his Britannick Maje&s;ty the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of its
friend&s;hip, and of its intention to take no part in the differ|ences
between him and France, but &s;uch as &s;hould be con|ciliatory,
and tending to re&s;tore the publick tranquillity.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. On the other hand, his Britannick Maje&s;ty
required, as King of Great-Britain, the auxiliaries &s;tipu|lated
to him by treaty from the Empre&s;s-Queen. But
the&s;e were refu&s;ed, under pretence, that as the conte&s;t be|tween
him and France related to America only, it was
not a ca&s;e of the alliance; though at the &s;ame time the
French made no &s;cruple of owning, that they intended to
make a powerful de&s;cent on Great-Britain early in the
&s;pring. When, a little while after, France being em|ployed
in making great preparations for a land war in Eu|rope,
the King of England required her to defend her own
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the Barrier in the Low Countries, with the
number of men &s;tipulated by treaty, which countries,
acquired by Engli&s;h blood and Engli&s;h trea&s;ure, had been
given to her on that expre&s;s condition, &s;he declared that
&s;he could not &s;pare troops for that purpo&s;e, on account of
her dangerous enemy the King of Pru&s;&s;ia: and afterwards,
when he was &s;ecured by his treaty with England, &s;he urg|ed
that as a rea&s;on for her alliance with France. It mu&s;t
be owned, however, for the &s;ake of hi&s;torical truth, that
this was no bad rea&s;on, con&s;idering the power, the genius,
and the character of that prince, who hovered over her
dominions with an army of one hundred and fifty thou&s;and
veterans. It mu&s;t likewi&s;e be owned that &s;he undertook
to procure the French King's con&s;ent to a neutrality for
Hanover, which would have effectually &s;ecured that elec|torate
from the inva&s;ion of every other power but Pru&s;&s;ia
<PB N="434" REF="442">
it&s;elf; and it is no &s;trained conjecture to &s;uppo&s;e that the
dread of this very power was the true &s;ource of tho&s;e con|nections
in Germany, which entailed &s;uch a ruinous con|tinental
war upon Great Britain.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. Though the Engli&s;h continued to make
repri&s;als upon the French, not only in the &s;eas of America,
but al&s;o in tho&s;e of Europe, by taking every &s;hip they could
meet with, and detaining them, their cargoes and crews;
yet the French, whether from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their
want of power by &s;ea; or that they might have a more
plau&s;ible plea to repre&s;ent England as the aggre&s;&s;or, were
&s;o far from returning the&s;e ho&s;tilities, that their fleet,
which e&s;caped Sir Edward Hawke, having, on the thir|teenth
of Augu&s;t, taken the Blandford &s;hip of war, with
Governor Lyttleton on board, going to Carolina, they
&s;et the Governor at liberty, as &s;oon as the court was in|formed
of the &s;hip's being brought into Nantes, and &s;hort|ly
after relea&s;ed both the &s;hip and crew. However, at the
&s;ame time, their preparations for a land war &s;till went on
with great diligence, and their utmo&s;t arts and efforts were
fruitle&s;ly exerted to per&s;uade the Spaniards and Dutch
to join with them again&s;t Great-Britain.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. In England the preparations by &s;ea became
greater than ever; &s;everal new &s;hips of war were put in
commi&s;&s;ion, and many others taken into the &s;ervice of the
government: the exportation of gunpowder was forbid:
the bounties to &s;eamen were continued, and the number
of tho&s;e that either entered voluntarily, or were pre&s;&s;ed,
increa&s;ed daily, as did al&s;o the captures from the French,
among which was the E&s;perance, of &s;eventy guns, taken
as &s;he was going from Rochefort to Bre&s;t to be manned.
The land forces of Great-Britain were likewi&s;e ordered to
be augmented; &s;everal new regiments were rai&s;ed, and all
half-pay officers, and the out-pen&s;ioners belonging to
Chel&s;ea-ho&s;pital, were directed to &s;end in their names,
ages, and time of &s;ervice, in order that &s;uch of them as
were yet able to &s;erve might be employed again if wanted.
The Engli&s;h navy, &s;o early as in the month of Septem|ber
of this year, con&s;i&s;ted of one &s;hip of an hundred and
<PB N="435" REF="443">
ten guns, five of an hundred guns each, thirteen of nine|ty,
eight of eighty, five of &s;eventy-four, twenty-nine of
&s;eventy, four of &s;ixty-&s;ix, one of &s;ixty-four, thirty-three
of &s;ixty, three of fifty-four, twenty-eight of fifty, four
of forty-four, thirty-five of forty, and forty-two of twen|ty,
four &s;loops of war of eighteen guns each, two of &s;ix|teen,
eleven of fourteen, thirteen of twelve, and one of
ten, be&s;ides a great number of bomb-ketches, fire-&s;hips,
and tenders; a force &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e the united mari|time
&s;trength of all the powers in Europe; whil&s;t that of
the French, even at the end of this year, and including
the &s;hips then upon the &s;tocks, amounted to no more than
&s;ix &s;hips of eighty guns, twenty-one of &s;eventy-four, one
of &s;eventy-two, four of &s;eventy, thirty-one of &s;ixty-four,
two of &s;ixty, &s;ix of fifty, and thirty-two frigates.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. Such was the &s;ituation of the two kingdoms,
when, on the thirteenth of November, the parliament met,
and his Maje&s;ty opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech from the
throne, in which he acquainted them&mdash;&startq;That the mo&s;t
proper mea&s;ures had been taken to protect our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions
in America, and to regain &s;uch parts thereof as had
been encroached upon, or invaded; that to pre&s;erve his
people from the calamities of war, as well as to prevent
a general war from being lighted up in Europe, he had
been always ready to accept rea&s;onable and honourable
terms of accommodation, but that none &s;uch had been
propo&s;ed by France: that he had al&s;o confined his views
and operations to hinder France from making new en|croachments,
or &s;upporting tho&s;e already made; to exert
his people's right to a &s;atisfaction for ho&s;tilities commit|ted
in a time of profound peace, and to di&s;appoint &s;uch
de&s;igns, as, from various appearances and preparations,
there was rea&s;on to think had been formed again&s;t his
kingdoms and dominions: that the King of Spain
earne&s;tly wi&s;hed the pre&s;ervation of the public tran|quillity,
and had given a&s;&s;urances of his intention to
continue in the &s;ame pacific &s;entiments: that he him|&s;elf
had greatly increa&s;ed his naval armaments, and auq|mented
<PB N="436" REF="444">
his land forces in &s;uch a manner as might be
lea&s;t burthen&s;ome; and, finally, that he had conclud|ed
a treaty with the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, and another
with the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, which &s;hould be
laid before them.&endq;</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. In an&s;wer to this &s;peech, both Hou&s;es voted
mo&s;t loyal addre&s;&s;es, but not without a warm oppo&s;ition,
in each, to &s;ome of the particular expre&s;&s;ions, for it having
been propo&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords to in&s;ert in their ad|dre&s;s
the words following, viz. &startq;That they looked upon
them&s;elves as obliged, by the &s;tronge&s;t ties of duty, grati|tude,
and honour, to &s;tand by and &s;upport his Maje&s;ty
in all &s;uch wi&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures and engage|ments
as his Maje&s;ty might have taken in vindication
of the rights of his crown, or to defeat any attempts
which might be made by France, in re&s;entment for
&s;uch mea&s;ures, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty in di&s;appointing
or repelling all &s;uch enterpri&s;es as might be formed, not
only again&s;t his kingdoms, but al&s;o again&s;t any other of
his dominions (though not belonging to the crown of
Great-Britain) in ca&s;e they &s;hould be attacked on ac|count
of the part which his Maje&s;ty had taken for main|taining
the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of his kingdoms;&endq; the
in&s;erting of the&s;e words in their addre&s;s was oppo&s;ed by
Earl Temple, and &s;everal other lords; becau&s;e, by the fir&s;t
part of them, they engaged to approve of the treaties with
Ru&s;&s;ia and He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, neither of which they had ever
&s;een, nor could it be &s;uppo&s;ed that either of them could be
of any advantage to this nation; and by the &s;econd part of
the&s;e words it &s;eemed to be re&s;olved to engage this nation
in a continental connexion for the defence of Hanover,
which it was impo&s;&s;ible for England to &s;upport, and which
would be &s;o far from being of any advantage to it at &s;ea
or in America, that it might at la&s;t di&s;able the nation from
defending it&s;elf in either of tho&s;e parts of the world. But
upon putting the que&s;tion, the in&s;erting of the&s;e words was
agreed to by a great majority, and accordingly they &s;tand
as part of the addre&s;s of the Hou&s;e upon that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="437" REF="445">
&sect; XXXII. To this remarkable addre&s;s his Maje&s;ty re|turned
the following as remarkable an&s;wer: &startq;My lords,
I give you my hearty thanks for this dutiful and af|fectionate
addre&s;s. I &s;ee, with the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction,
the zeal you expre&s;s for my per&s;on and government,
and for the true intere&s;t of your country, which I $word$
determined to adhere to. The a&s;&s;urances which you give
me for the defence of my territories abroad are a &s;trong
proof of your affection for me, and regard for my honour.
Nothing &s;hall divert me from pur&s;uing tho&s;e mea&s;ures
which will effectually maintain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and rights
of my kingdoms, and procure rea&s;onable and honourable
terms of accommodation.&endq;&mdash;The addre&s;s of the Hou&s;e of
Commons breathed the &s;ame &s;pirit of zeal and gratitude,
and was full of the warme&s;t a&s;&s;urances of a ready &s;upport of
his Maje&s;ty, and of his foreign dominions, if attacked in
re&s;entment of his maintaining the rights of his crown and
kingdom; and his Maje&s;ty's an&s;wer to it was to the &s;ame
effect as that to the Hou&s;e of Lords. The &s;ame, or nearly
the &s;ame words, relating to the treaties concluded by his
Maje&s;ty, and to the defence of his foreign dominions,
were propo&s;ed to be in&s;erted in this addre&s;s, which was op|po&s;ed
by William Pitt, E&s;q. then payma&s;ter of his Maje&s;|ty's
forces; the Right Hon. Henry Legge, E&s;q. then chan|cellor
and under-trea&s;urer of his Maje&s;ty's Exchequer, and
one of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury; and by &s;everal
other gentlemen in high po&s;ts under the government, as
well as by many others: but, upon putting the que&s;tion,
it was by a con&s;iderable majority agreed to in&s;ert the words
objected to; and very &s;oon after, Mr. Pitt, Mr. Legge,
and mo&s;t, if not all, of the gentlemen who had appeared
in the oppo&s;ition, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their employments.
In the mean time, a draft came over from Ru&s;&s;ia for part
of the new &s;ub&s;idy &s;tipulated to that crown; but &s;ome of
the mini&s;try, who were then at the head of the finances,
refu&s;ed to pay it, at lea&s;t before the treaty &s;hould be
approved of by parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="446">
&sect; XXXIII. Sir Thomas Robin&s;on had not been long
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, before it was
generally perceived, that, though an hone&s;t, well-meaning
man, and a favourite with the King, his abilities were not
equal to the functions of that po&s;t. Much le&s;s were they
&s;o at this juncture, when the nation was on the point of
being engaged in a difficult and expen&s;ive war, and plunged
into foreign mea&s;ures and connections, which would re|quire
the utmo&s;t &s;kill of an able politician to render them
palatable to the people. Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox, though
they &s;carce ever agreed in any other particular, had ge|nerally
united in oppo&s;ing his mea&s;ures, and their &s;uperior
influence in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and univer&s;ally ac|knowledged
abilities, though of very different kinds, had
always prevailed, uncommon as it was, to &s;ee two per&s;ons
who held con&s;iderable places under the government, one
of them being payma&s;ter-general, and the other &s;ecretary
at war, oppo&s;e, upon almo&s;t every occa&s;ion, a &s;ecretary of
&s;tate, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to know and &s;peak the &s;entiments
of his ma&s;ter. Sir Thomas him&s;elf &s;oon grew &s;en&s;ible of
his want of &s;ufficient weight in the &s;enate of the nation;
and therefore, of his own accord, on the tenth of Novem|ber,
wi&s;ely and dutifully re&s;igned the &s;eals of his office to
his Maje&s;ty, who delivered them to Mr. Fox, and ap|pointed
Sir Thomas ma&s;ter of the wardrobe, with a pen&s;ion
to him during his life, and after his death to his &s;ons.
Lord Barrington &s;ucceeded Mr. Fox as &s;ecretary at war;
and &s;oon after Sir George Lyttelton was made chancellor
of the Exchequer, and a lord of the Trea&s;ury, in the room
of Mr. Legge, who had declared him&s;elf again&s;t the new
continental &s;y&s;tem. However, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e
changes in the mini&s;try, very warm debates aro&s;e in both
Hou&s;es, when the treaties of Ru&s;&s;ia and He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el came
to be con&s;idered by them: &s;ome of the members were for
referring them to a committee; but this motion was over|ruled,
in con&s;ideration of his Maje&s;ty's having engaged in
them to guard again&s;t a &s;torm that &s;eemed ready to break
upon his electoral dominions, merely on account of our
<PB N="439" REF="447">
quarrel with the French. They were at length approved
of by a majority of three hundred and eighteen again&s;t one
hundred and twenty-&s;ix, in the Hou&s;e of Commons; and
by eighty-four again&s;t eleven, in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. The Hou&s;e of Commons then proceeded to
provide for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, and for the
deficiencies of the provi&s;ions for the former. Fifty thou|&s;and
&s;eamen, including nine thou&s;and one hundred and
thirty-eight marines, were voted, on the twenty-fourth of
November, for the &s;ervice of the year one thou&s;and &s;even
hundred and fifty-&s;ix, together with two millions &s;ix hun|dred
thou&s;and pounds for their maintenance, and thirty-four
thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty-three land &s;oldiers,
with nine hundred and thirty thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and
three pounds, &s;ix &s;hillings, and nine pence for their &s;up|port.
An hundred thou&s;and pounds were voted as a &s;ub|&s;idy
to the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia; fifty-four thou&s;and one
hundred and forty pounds, twelve &s;hillings, and &s;ix|pence
to the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el; and ten thou&s;and
pounds to the Elector of Bavaria.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the publick was
overwhelmed with con&s;ternation, by the tidings of a dread|ful
earthquake, which, on the fir&s;t of November, &s;hook all
Spain and Portugal, and many other places in Europe,
and laid the city of Li&s;bon in ruins. When the news of
this great calamity fir&s;t reached England, it was feared the
con&s;equences of it might affect our publick credit, con&s;i|dering
the va&s;t intere&s;t which the Engli&s;h merchants had
in the Portugue&s;e trade: but, fortunately, it afterwards
proved incon&s;iderable, in compari&s;on of what had been ap|prehended:
the quarter in which the Engli&s;h chiefly lived,
and where they had their warehou&s;es, having &s;uffered the
lea&s;t of any part of the city; and mo&s;t of the Engli&s;h mer|chants
then re&s;iding there, together with their families,
being at their country hou&s;es, to avoid the in&s;ults to which
they might have been expo&s;ed from the Portugue&s;e popu|lace,
during the celebration of their <HI>Auto-da-&s;e,</HI> which was
kept that very day. The two fir&s;t &s;hocks of this dreadful
<PB N="440" REF="448">
vi&s;itation continued near a quarter of an hour, after which
the water of the river Tagus ro&s;e perpendicularly above
twenty feet, and &s;ub&s;ided to its natural bed in le&s;s than a
minute. Great numbers of hou&s;es, of which this city then
contained about thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and, extending in length
near &s;ix miles, in form of a cre&s;cent, on the a&s;cent of a hill,
upon the north &s;hore of the mouth of the river Tagus,
within nine miles from the ocean, were thrown down by
the repeated commotions of the earth, together with &s;everal
magnificent churches, mona&s;teries, and publick buildings.
But what entirely completed the ruin of this then mo&s;t
opulent capital of the Portugue&s;e dominions, was a devour|ing
conflagration, partly fortuitous or natural, but chiefly
occa&s;ioned by a &s;et of impious villains, who, unawed by
the tremendous &s;cene at that very in&s;tant pa&s;&s;ing before
their eyes, with a wickedne&s;s &s;carcely to be credited, &s;et fire
even to the falling edifices in different parts of the city, to
increa&s;e the general confu&s;ion, that they might have the
better opportunity to rob and plunder their already de&s;olated
fellow citizens. Out of three hundred and fifty thou&s;and
inhabitants, which Li&s;bon was then &s;uppo&s;ed to contain,
about ten thou&s;and peri&s;hed by this calamity; and the &s;ur|vivors,
deprived of their habitations, and de&s;titute even
of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, were forced to &s;eek for &s;helter in
the open fields.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. As &s;oon as his Maje&s;ty received an account
of this deplorable event, from his amba&s;&s;ador at the court
of Madrid, he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to both Hou&s;es of parliament
on the twenty-eighth of November, acquainting them
therewith, and de&s;iring their concurrence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to|wards
&s;peedily relieving the unhappy &s;ufferers; and the
parliament thereupon, to the honour of Briti&s;h hu|manity,
unanimou&s;ly voted, on the eighth of December,
a gift of an hundred thou&s;and pounds for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
people of Portugal. A circum&s;tance which enhances the
merit of this action is, that though the Engli&s;h them&s;elves
were, at that very time, in great want of grain, a con&s;ider|able
part of the &s;um was &s;ent in corn, flour, rice, and a
<PB N="441" REF="449">
large quantity of beef from Ireland: &s;upplies which came
very &s;ea&s;onably for the poor Portugue&s;e, who were in
actual want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Their king was &s;o
affected by this in&s;tan$e of Briti&s;h genero&s;ity, that, to &s;how
his gratitude for the timely relief, he ordered Mr. Ca&s;tres,
the Briti&s;h re&s;ident at his court, to give the preference, in
the di&s;tribution of the&s;e &s;upplies, to the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects,
who had &s;uffered by the earthquake: accordingly, about
a thirtieth part of the provi&s;ions, and two thou&s;and pounds
in money, were &s;et apart for that purpo&s;e; and his Por|tugue&s;e
Maje&s;ty returned his thanks, in very warm terms,
to the Briti&s;h crown and nation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. The report of an intended inva&s;ion of
the&s;e kingdoms by the French increa&s;ing daily; on the
twenty-&s;econd day of January Lord Barrington, as &s;ecre|tary
at war, laid before the Hou&s;e an e&s;timate for defraying
the charge of ten new regiments of foot, over and above
the thirty-four thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty-three land
&s;oldiers before ordered to be rai&s;ed; and a &s;um of ninety-one
thou&s;and nine hundred and nineteen pounds, ten &s;hillings,
was voted for the&s;e additional forces: upon another e&s;timate
pre&s;ented a little after by the &s;ame lord, and founded upon
the &s;ame rea&s;ons, for rai&s;ing, for the further defence of the
kingdom, eleven troops of light dragoons, forty-nine
thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and twenty-eight pounds, eleven
&s;hillings, and three pence, were voted for the en&s;uing
year; together with eighty-one thou&s;and one hundred
and &s;eventy-eight pounds, &s;ixteen &s;hillings, for a
$egiment of foot to be rai&s;ed in North-America;
two hundred and ninety-eight thou&s;and five hundred
and thirty-four pounds, &s;eventeen &s;hillings, and ten pence
half-penny, for the maintenance of our forces already-e&s;tabli&s;hed
in our American colonies; and &s;eventy-nine
thou&s;and nine hundred and fifteen pounds, &s;ix &s;hillings, for
$ix regiments of foot from Ireland, to &s;erve in North-Ame|rica
and the Ea&s;t-Indies. Be&s;ides all the&s;e &s;upplies,
Mr. Fox, on the twenty-eighth of January, pre&s;ented to
the Hou&s;e a me&s;&s;age from the King, de&s;iring them to take
<PB N="442" REF="450">
into con&s;ideration the faithful &s;ervices of the people of
New-England, and of &s;ome other parts of North-America;
upon which one hundred and fifteen thou&s;and pounds more
were voted, and five thou&s;and pounds as a reward to Sir
William John&s;on in particular. In &s;hort, including &s;everal
other &s;ums, as well for defraying the expen&s;e of the army
and navy, as for a &s;ub&s;idy of twenty thou&s;and pounds to
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and one hundred and twenty-one thou|&s;and
four hundred and forty-&s;even pounds, two &s;hillings,
and &s;ix-pence, for Hanoverian troops, of which two la&s;t
articles further notice will be taken hereafter, the whole of
the &s;upplies granted by parliament in this &s;e&s;&s;ion amounted
to &s;even millions two hundred and twenty-nine thou&s;and
one hundred and &s;eventeen pounds, four &s;hillings, and &s;ix-pence
three farthings. For rai&s;ing this &s;um, be&s;ides the
malt-tax, and the land-tax of four &s;hillings in the pound,
the whole produce of the &s;inking-fund, from the fifth of
January one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;ix, till it
&s;hould amount to one million five hundred and fifty-five
thou&s;and nine hundred and fifty-five pounds, eleven &s;hillings,
and eleven pence half-penny, was ordered to be applied
thereunto; together with a million to be rai&s;ed by loans,
or Exchequer-bills, at three per cent. intere&s;t; one million
five hundred thou&s;and pounds to be rai&s;ed by the &s;ale of
redeemable annuities, at three and a half per cent. and five
hundred thou&s;and pounds to be rai&s;ed by a lottery, at three
per cent. All which &s;ums, with eighty-three thou&s;and four
hundred and twelve pounds, two &s;hillings, and five pence
half-penny, then remaining in the Exchequer, amounted
to &s;even millions four hundred and twenty-&s;even thou&s;and
two hundred and &s;ixty-one pounds, five &s;hillings, and &s;even
pence.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The clau&s;e in&s;erted in the mutiny bill la&s;t
year, &s;ubjecting all officers and &s;oldiers rai&s;ed in America$
by authority of the re&s;pective governors or government$
there, to the &s;ame rules and articles of war, and the &s;ame
penalties and puni&s;hments, as the Briti&s;h forces were liable
to; the act pa&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time for regulating the ma|rine
<PB N="443" REF="451">
forces, while on &s;hore: and that for the more &s;peedy
and effectual manning of his Maje&s;ty's navy, were not only
confirmed now; but it was further enacted, with re&s;pect to
this la&s;t, as well as for the more &s;peedy and effectual re|cruiting
of his Maje&s;ty's land-forces. That the commi&s;|&s;ioners
appointed by the pre&s;ent act &s;hould be empowered
to rai&s;e and levy, within their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions, &s;uch
able bodied men as did not follow any lawful calling or
employment: or had not &s;ome other lawful and &s;ufficient
&s;upport: and might order, wherever and whenever they
plea&s;ed, a general &s;earch to be made for &s;uch per&s;ons, in
order to their being brought before them to be examined;
nay, that the pari&s;h or town officers might, without any
&s;uch order, &s;earch for and &s;ecure &s;uch per&s;ons, in order to
convey them before the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners to be examined:
That if any three commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould find any per&s;on, &s;o
brought before them, to be within the above de&s;cription; and
if the recruiting officer attending &s;hould judge him to be
a man fit for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, they &s;hould cau&s;e him to
be delivered to &s;uch officer, who might &s;ecure him in any
place of &s;afety provided by the ju&s;tices of peace for that
purpo&s;e, or even in any publick pri&s;on; and that every
&s;uch man was from that time to be deemed a li&s;ted &s;oldier,
and not to be taken out of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice by any pro|ce&s;s,
other than for &s;ome criminal matter. Nothing
could more plainly &s;how either the zeal of the parliament
for a vigorous pro&s;ecution of the war, or their confidence
in the ju&s;tice and moderation of our mini&s;try, than their
agreeing to this act, which was to continue in force till the
end of the next &s;e&s;&s;ion: and which, in the hands of a
wicked and enterpri&s;ing admini&s;tration, might have been
made &s;uch an u&s;e of, as would have been incon&s;i&s;tent with
that &s;ecurity which is provided by our happy con&s;titution
for the liberty of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The next object of the immediate attention
of parliament in this &s;e&s;&s;ion was the rai&s;ing of a new regi|ment
of foot in North-America; for which purpo&s;e the
&s;um of eighty-one thou&s;and one hundred and &s;eventy-eight
<PB N="444" REF="452">
pounds, &s;ixteen &s;hillings, to which the e&s;timate thereof
amounted, was voted. This regiment, which was to con|&s;i&s;t
of four battalions of a thou&s;and men each, was intended
to be rai&s;ed chiefly out of the Germans and Swi&s;s, who, for
many years pa&s;t, had annually tran&s;ported them&s;elves in
great numbers to the Briti&s;h plantations in America, where
wa&s;te lands had been a&s;&s;igned them upon the frontiers of the
provinces; but, very injudiciou&s;ly, no care had been taken
to intermix them with the Engli&s;h inhabitants of the place.
To this circum&s;tance it is owing, that they have continued
to corre&s;pond and conver&s;e only with one another; &s;o that
very few of them, even of tho&s;e who have been born there
have yet learned to &s;peak or under&s;tand the Engli&s;h tongue
However, as they were all zealous prote&s;tants, and in gene|ral
&s;trong, hardy men, and accu&s;tomed to the climate, i$
was judged that a regiment of good and faithful &s;oldier
might be rai&s;ed out of them, particularly proper to oppo&s;$
the French: but to this end it was nece&s;&s;ary to appoint &s;om$
officers, e&s;pecially &s;ubalterns, who under&s;tood military di&s;|cipline,
and could &s;peak the German-language; and as
$ &s;ufficient number of &s;uch coul$ not be found among th$
Engli&s;h officers, it was nece&s;&s;ary to bring over and gran$
commi&s;&s;ions to &s;everal German and Swi&s;s officers and en|gineers:
but as this &s;tep, by the act of &s;ettlement, could
not be taken without the authority of parliament, and a$$
was now pa&s;&s;ed for enabling his Maje&s;ty to grant commi&s;&s;i$|ons
to a certain number of foreign prote&s;tants, who ha$
&s;erved abroad as officers or engineers, to act and rank $word$
officers or engineers in America only. An act was likewi&s;$
pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;trictly forbidding, under pain $word$
death, any of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects to &s;erve as officers u$|der
the French King, or to inli&s;t as &s;oldiers in his &s;ervice
without his Maje&s;ty's previous licen&s;e; and al&s;o for obli$|ing
&s;uch of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects as &s;hould, in time $word$
come, accept of commi&s;&s;ions in the Scotch brigade in th$
Dutch &s;ervice, to take the oaths of allegiance and abjur$|tion,
on pain of forfeiting five hundred pounds.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. As it had been re&s;olved, in th$ beginning of the
preceding &s;ummer, to build ve&s;&s;els of force upon the lak$
<PB N="445" REF="453">
Ontario, an act was now pa&s;&s;ed for extending the maritime
laws of England, relating to the government of his Maje&s;ty's
&s;hips and forces by &s;ea, to &s;uch officers, &s;eamen, and others,
as &s;hould &s;erve on board his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els em|ployed
upon the lakes, great waters, or rivers, in North-America;
and al&s;o, but not without oppo&s;ition to this la&s;t,
for the better recruiting of his Maje&s;ty's forces upon the
continent of America: to which end, by a new clau&s;e now
added to a former act, a recruiting officer was empowered
to enli&s;t and detain an indented &s;ervant, even though his
ma&s;ter &s;hould reclaim him, upon paying to the ma&s;ter &s;uch
a &s;um as two ju&s;tices of peace within the precinct &s;hould
adjudge to be a rea&s;onable equivalent for the original pur|cha&s;e
money, and the remaining time &s;uch &s;ervant might
have to &s;erve.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. The inte&s;tine broils of Ireland were happily
compo&s;ed this year, by the prudent management of the
Marquis of Hartington, lord-lieutenant of that kingdom.
By his &s;teady and di&s;intere&s;ted conduct, his candour and
humanity, the Iri&s;h were not only brought to a much better
temper, even among them&s;elves, than they were before
their late outrageous riots and dangerous di&s;&s;entions hap|pened;
but al&s;o prevailed upon to acquie&s;ce in the mea|&s;ures
of England, without this la&s;t being obliged to give up
any one point of her &s;uperiority. The leading men in the
parliament of Ireland were the fir&s;t that conformed: and
though the ferment continued very high for &s;ome time after
among the middling and lower ranks of people, it was at
length entirely allayed by the wi&s;dom of the Lord-Lieu|tenant,
and the excellent laws which he encouraged and
pa&s;&s;ed for the benefit of that nation.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Among other objects of the attention of the legi&s;lature of that country, ten thou&s;and pounds were granted for making the river Nore navigable from the city of Kilkenny to the town of Inne&s;talge; twenty thou&s;and pounds towards carrying on an inland navigation from the city of Dublin to the river Shannon; four thou&s;and pounds for making the river Newry naviga|ble, a thou&s;and pounds a year for two years, for the encouragement of Engli&s;h prote&s;tant &s;chools; &s;everal &s;ums, to be di&s;tributed in premiums, for the encouragement of the cambrick, hempen, and &s;laxen manufactures; and three hundred thou&s;and pounds to his Maje&s;ty, towards &s;upporting the &s;everal branches of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, and for defraying the expen&s;es of the government for two years.</NOTE> The P&mdash;of
<PB N="446" REF="454">
Ireland, who had been very bu&s;y in fomenting many of
the late di&s;turbances, was, by his Maje&s;ty's command,
&s;truck off the li&s;t of privy-coun&s;ellors; and the greate&s;t part
of tho&s;e patriots, whom faction had turned out of their
employments there, were re-in&s;tated with honour.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. The parliament of England, which had ad|journed
on the twenty-third of December, met again;
the Hou&s;e of Commons on the thirteenth of January, and
the Lords on the nineteenth. On the &s;ixteenth of the
&s;ame month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1756.</NOTE> the treaty between his Britannick Maje&s;ty
and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was &s;igned, importing, That, for
the defence of their common country, Germany, and in
order to pre&s;erve her peace and tranquillity, which it was
feared was in danger of being di&s;turbed, on account of
the di&s;putes of America; the two kings, for that end only,
entered into a convention of neutrality, by which they re|ciprocally
bound them&s;elves not to &s;uffer foreign troops
of any nation what&s;oever to enter into Germany, or pa&s;s
through it, during the troubles afore&s;aid, and the con&s;e|quences
that might re&s;ult from them; but to oppo&s;e the
&s;ame with their utmo&s;t might, in order to &s;ecure Germany
from the calamities of war, maintain her fundamental
laws and con&s;titutions, and pre&s;erve her peace uninter|rupted.
Thus, the late treaty with Ru&s;&s;ia was virtually
renounced. Their Maje&s;ties, moreover, &s;ei&s;ed this fa|vourable
opportunity to adju&s;t the differences that had &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted
between them, in relation to the remainder of the
Sile&s;ia loan due to the &s;ubjects of his Britannick Maje&s;ty,
and the indemnification claimed by the &s;ubjects of his
Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty for their lo&s;&s;es by &s;ea during the late war;
&s;o that the attachment laid on the &s;aid debt was agreed to
he taken off, as &s;oon as the ratification of this treaty &s;hould
be exchanged.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. On the twenty-fir&s;t of January the Hou&s;e took
into con&s;ideration the laws then in being, relating to the
militia of this kingdom; and, finding them in&s;ufficient,
ordered a new bill to be prepared, and brought in, for the
better regulating of the militia forces in the &s;everal coun|ties
<PB N="447" REF="455">
of England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1756.</NOTE> A bill was accordingly prepared to that
effect, and pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e on the twelfth of March
by the Hon. Charles Town&s;hend, E&s;q. who, to his ho|nour,
was one of the chief promoters of it. After receiv|ing
many amendments in the Hou&s;e of Commons, it was
on the tenth of May pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;ent to the Lords: but
&s;everal objections being made to it by &s;ome of the peers,
and it &s;eeming to them that &s;ome further amendments were
&s;till nece&s;&s;ary, which they thought they could not in that
&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;pare time to con&s;ider &s;o maturely as the importance
of the &s;ubject required, a negative of fifty-nine again&s;t
twenty-three was put upon the motion for pa&s;&s;ing the bill;
though every one mu&s;t have been &s;en&s;ible, not only of the
propriety, but even of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a law,
which was ardently de&s;ired by the whole nation.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. On the twenty-&s;eventh of May his Maje&s;ty
went to the Hou&s;e of Peers, and, after having given the
royal a&s;&s;ent to the bills then depending, thanked his parlia|ament,
in a &s;peech from the throne, for their vigorous and
effectual &s;upport. He acquainted them, that the injuries
and ho&s;tilities which had been for &s;ome time committed by
the French again&s;t his dominions and &s;ubjects were then
followed by the actual inva&s;ion of the i&s;land of Minorca,
though guaranteed to him by all the great powers of Eu|rope,
and particularly by the French King: That he had,
therefore, found him&s;elf obliged, in vindication of the ho|nour
of his crown, and of the rights of his people, to de|clare
war in form again&s;t France; and that he relied on
the Divine Protection, and the vigorous a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his
faithful &s;ubjects, in &s;o ju&s;t a cau&s;e. The parliament was
$hen adjourned to the eighteenth of June; and from thence
$fterwards to the eighteenth of July, and then it was pro|$ogued.</P>

<P>&sect; I. IN the month of January Mr. Fox, CHAP. V. lately appointed
&s;ecretary of &s;tate, received a letter from M. Rou|$ll&eacute;,
mini&s;ter and &s;ecretary of &s;tate for foreign affairs to the
King of France, expo&s;tulating, in the name of his &s;ove|reign,
upon the orders and in&s;tructions for committing
ho&s;tilities, which his Britannick Maje&s;ty had given to
General Braddock and Admiral Bo&s;cawen, in diametrical
oppo&s;ition to the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances &s;o often repeated
by word of mouth, as well as in writing. He complained
of the in&s;ult which had been offered to his ma&s;ter's flag, in
attacking and taking two of his &s;hips in the open &s;ea, with|out
any previous declaration of war; as al&s;o by committing
depredations on the commerce of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's
&s;ubjects, in contempt of the law of nations, the faith of
treaties, and the u&s;ages e&s;tabli&s;hed among civili&s;ed nations.
He &s;aid, the &s;entiments and character of his Britannick
Maje&s;ty gave the king his ma&s;ter room to expect, that, at
his return to London, he would di&s;avow the conduct of
his Admiralty; but &s;eeing that, in&s;tead of puni&s;hing, he
rather encouraged tho&s;e who had been guilty of &s;uch de|predations,
his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty would be deemed
deficient in what he owed to his own glory, the dignity of
his crown, and the defence of his people, if he deferred any
longer demanding a &s;ignal reparation for the outrage done
to the French flag, and the damage &s;u&s;tained by his &s;ubjects.
He, therefore, demanded immediate and full re&s;titution of
all the French &s;hips, which, contrary to law and decorum,
had been taken by the Engli&s;h navy, together with all the
officers, &s;oldiers, mariners, guns, &s;tores, and merchandi&s;e.
He declared, that &s;hould this re&s;titution be made, he &s;hould
be willing to engage in a negociation for what further &s;atis|faction
he might claim, and continue de&s;irous to &s;ee the
<PB N="450" REF="458">
differences relating to America determined by a &s;olid and
equitable accommodation: but if, contrary to all hopes,
the&s;e demands &s;hould be rejected, he would con&s;ider &s;uch
a denial of ju&s;tice as the mo&s;t authentick declaration of
war, and as a formed de&s;ign in the court of London to
di&s;turb the peace of Europe. To this peremptory remon|&s;trance
the Briti&s;h &s;ecretary was directed to an&s;wer, That
though the King of England would readily con&s;ent to an
equitable and &s;olid accommodation, he would not comply
with the demand of immediate and full re&s;titution as a pre|liminary
condition; for his Maje&s;ty had taken no &s;teps
but &s;uch as were rendered ju&s;t and indi&s;pen&s;ible by the
ho&s;tilities which the French began in time of profound
peace, and a proper regard for his own honour, the rights
and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of his crown, and the &s;ecurity of his king|doms.</P>
<P>&sect; II. Without all doubt the late tran&s;actions had afforded
&s;pecious arguments for both nations to impeach the conduct of
each other. The French court, con&s;cious of their encroach|ments
in Nova-Scotia, affected to draw a &s;hade over the&s;e, as
particulars belonging to a di&s;puted territory, and to divert
the attention to the banks of the Ohio, where Jamonville
and his detachment had been attacked and ma&s;&s;acred by
the Engli&s;h, without the lea&s;t provocation. They like|wi&s;e
inveighed again&s;t the capture of their &s;hips, before
any declaration of war, as &s;lagrant acts of piracy; and
&s;ome neutral powers of Europe &s;eemed to con&s;ider them in
the &s;ame point of view. It was certainly high time to
cheek the in&s;olence of the French by force of arms, and
&s;urely this might have been as effectually and expeditiou&s;ly
exerted under the u&s;ual &s;anction of a formal declaration;
the omi&s;&s;ion of which expo&s;ed the admini&s;tration to the
cen&s;ure of our neighbours, and fixed the imputation of
fraud and free-booting on the beginning of the war. The
mini&s;try was &s;aid to have delayed the ceremony of de|nouncing
war from political con&s;iderations, &s;uppo&s;ing
that, &s;hould the French be provoked into the fir&s;t declara|tion
of this kind, the powers of Europe would con&s;ider
<PB N="451" REF="459">
his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty as the aggre&s;&s;or, and Great-Britain
would reap all the fruits of the defen&s;ive alliances
in which &s;he had engaged. But nothing could be more
weak and frivolous than &s;uch a conjecture. The aggre&s;&s;or
is he who fir&s;t violates the peace; and every ally will in|terpret
the aggre&s;&s;ion according to his own intere&s;t and
convenience. The admini&s;tration maintained the ap|pearance
of candour in the mid&s;t of their ho&s;tilities. The
merchant-&s;hips, of which a great number had been taken
from the French, were not &s;old and divided among the
captors, according to the practice of war; but carefully
&s;eque&s;tered, with all their cargoes and effects, in order to
be re&s;tored to the right owners, in ca&s;e the di&s;putes between
the two nations &s;hould not be productive of an open rup|ture.
In this particular, however, it was pity that a little
common &s;en&s;e had not been blended with their honourable
intention. Great part of the cargo con&s;i&s;ted of fi&s;h, and
other peri&s;hable commodities, which were left to rot and
putrify, and afterwards thrown overboard, to prevent con|tagion;
&s;o that the owners and captors were equally di&s;|appointed,
and the value of them lo&s;t to both nations.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The court of Ver&s;ailles, while they pre&s;ented re|mon&s;trances
which they knew would prove ineffectual,
and exclaimed again&s;t the conduct of Great-Britain with
all the arts of calumny and exaggeration at every court in
Chri&s;tendom, continued neverthele&s;s to make &s;uch prepa|rations
as denoted a de&s;ign to pro&s;ecute the war with un|common
vigour. They began to repair and fortify Dun|kirk:
orders were publi&s;hed, that all Briti&s;h &s;ubjects
&s;hould quit the dominions of France; many Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els
were &s;ei&s;ed in different ports of that kingdom, and their
crews &s;ent to pri&s;on. At the &s;ame time an edict was
i&s;&s;ued, inviting the French &s;ubjects to equip privateers,
offering a premium of forty livres for every gun, and as
much for every man they &s;hould take from the enemy;
and promi&s;ing that, in ca&s;e a peace &s;hould be &s;peedily con|cluded,
the king would purcha&s;e the privateers at prime
co&s;t. They employed great numbers of artificers and
<PB N="452" REF="460">
&s;eamen in equipping a formidable &s;quadron of &s;hips at Bre&s;t;
and a&s;&s;embling a &s;trong body of land-forces, as well as a
con&s;iderable number of tran&s;ports, threatened the i&s;land of
Great-Britain with a dangerous inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. The Engli&s;h people were &s;ei&s;ed with con&s;ternation:
the mini&s;try were alarmed and perplexed. Colonel Yorke,
the Briti&s;h re&s;ident at the Hague, was ordered by his Ma|je&s;ty
to make a requi&s;ition of the &s;ix thou&s;and men whom
the States-General are obliged by treaty to furni&s;h, when
Great-Britain &s;hall be threatened with an inva&s;ion; and
in February he pre&s;ented a memorial for this purpo&s;e.
Mon&s;ieur d'Affry, the French King's mini&s;ter at the Hague,
having received intimation of this demand, produced a
counter memorial from his ma&s;ter, charging the Engli&s;h
as the aggre&s;&s;ors, and giving the States-General plainly
to under&s;tand, that, &s;hould they grant the &s;uccours de|manded
by Great-Britain, he would con&s;ider their com|pliance
as an act of ho&s;tility again&s;t him&s;elf. The Dutch,
though divided among them&s;elves by faction, were unani|mou&s;ly
aver&s;e to any mea&s;ure that might involve them in
the approaching war. Their commerce was in a great
mea&s;ure decayed, and their finances were too much ex|hau&s;ted
to admit of an immediate augmentation of their
forces, which for many other rea&s;ons they &s;trove to avoid.
They fore&s;aw a great increa&s;e of trade in their adhering to
a punctual neutrality: they were afraid of the French by
land, and jealous of the Engli&s;h by &s;ea; and, perhaps, en|joyed
the pro&s;pect of &s;eeing the&s;e two proud and powerful
nations humble and impoveri&s;h each other. Certain it is,
the States General protracted their an&s;wer to Mr. Yorke's
memorial by &s;uch offected delays, that the court of Lon|don
perceived their intention, and, in order to avoid the
mortification of a $lat denial, the King ordered his re&s;i|dent
to acquaint the Prince&s;s regent, that he would not
in&s;i&s;t upon his demand. The States, thus freed from
their perplexity, at length delivered an an&s;wer to Mr.
Yorke, in which they expatiated on the difficulties they
were laid under, and thanked his Britannick Maje&s;ty for
<PB N="453" REF="461">
having freed them by his declaration from that embarra&s;&s;|ment
into which they were thrown by his fir&s;t demand and
the counter memorial of the French mini&s;ter. The real
&s;entiments of tho&s;e people, however, more plainly appeared
in the previous re&s;olution delivered to the States of Holland
by the towns of Am&s;terdam, Dort, Haerlem, Gouda,
Rotterdam, and Enckhuy&s;en, declaring flatly that England
was uncontrovertibly the aggre&s;&s;or in Europe, by &s;ei&s;ing
a con&s;iderable number of French ve&s;&s;els; that the threatened
inva&s;ion of Great-Britain did not affect the republick's
guarantee of the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, ina&s;much as it was
only intended to obtain reparation for the injury &s;u&s;tained
by the &s;ubjects of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty; finally,
that the &s;uccours demanded could be of no advantage to
the King of England, as it appeared by the declaration
of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maj&s;ty, that their granting the&s;e
&s;uccours would immediately lay them under a nece&s;&s;ity of
demanding, in their turn, a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Great-Britain.
From this way of arguing, the Engli&s;h may perceive what
they have to expect in ca&s;es of emergency from the friend|&s;hip
of their neare&s;t allies, who mu&s;t always be furni&s;hed
with the &s;ame excu&s;e, whenever they find it convenient or
nece&s;&s;ary to their own intere&s;t. Such a con&s;ideration,
joined to other concurring motives, ought to induce the
British legi&s;lature to withdraw its dependence from all
foreign connexions, and provide &s;uch a con&s;titutional force
within it&s;elf, as will be fully &s;ufficient to bafle all the
efforts of an external enemy. The apprehen&s;ions and
di&s;traction of the people at this juncture plainly evinced
the expediency of &s;uch a national force: but different par|ties
were divided in their opinions about the nature of
&s;uch a provi&s;ion. Some of the warme&s;t friends of their
country propo&s;ed a well regulated militia, as an in&s;titution
that would effectually an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of defending a
wide extending &s;ea-coa&s;t from inva&s;ion; while, on the
other hand, this propo&s;al was ridiculed and refuted as
impracticable or u&s;ele&s;s by all the retainers to the court, and
all the officers of the &s;tanding army. In the mean time,
<PB N="454" REF="462">
as the experiment could not be immediately tried, and
the pre&s;ent juncture demanded &s;ome in&s;tant determinati|on,
recour&s;e was had to a foreign remedy.</P>
<P>&sect; V. Towards the latter end of March, the King &s;ent a
written me&s;&s;age to parliament, intimating that he had re|ceived
repeated advices from different per&s;ons and places,
that a de&s;ign had been formed by the French court to invade
Great-Britain or Ireland; and the great preparations of
forces, &s;hips, artillery, and warlike &s;tores, then notori|ou&s;ly
making in the p$rts of France oppo&s;ite to the Briti&s;h
coa&s;ts, together with the language of the French mini&s;ters
in &s;ome foreign courts, left little room to doubt the reality
of &s;uch a de&s;ign: that his Maje&s;ty had augmented his forces
both by &s;ea and land, and taken proper mea&s;ures and pre|cautions
for putting his kingdom in a po&s;ture of defence:
that, in order further to &s;trengthen him&s;elf, he had made
a requi&s;ition of a body of He&s;&s;ian troops, pur&s;uant to the
late treaty, to be forthwith brought over, and for that pur|po&s;e
ordered tran&s;ports to be prepared: that he doubted
not of being enabled and &s;upported by his parliament in
taking &s;uch mea&s;ures as might be conducive to an end
&s;o e&s;&s;ential to the honour of his crown, the pre&s;ervation of
the prote&s;tant religion, and the laws and liberties of the&s;e
kingdoms. This me&s;&s;age was no &s;ooner received, than
both Hou&s;es voted, compo&s;ed, and pre&s;ented very warm and
affectionate addre&s;&s;es, in which his Maje&s;ty was thanked for
the requi&s;ition he had made of the He&s;&s;ian troops; a mea|&s;ure
which at any other time would have been &s;tigmati&s;ed
with all the &s;atire and rhetorick of the oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. Even this precaution was not thought &s;ufficient to
&s;ecure the i&s;land, and quiet the terrors of the people. In a
few days Mr. Fox, the new mini&s;ter, encouraged by the
unanimity which had appeared &s;o con&s;picuous in the mo|tions
for the late addre&s;&s;es, ventured to move again, in the
Hou&s;e of Commons, that another addre&s;s &s;hould be pre|&s;ented
to the King, be&s;eeching his Maje&s;ty, that for the
more effectual defence of this i&s;land, and for the better &s;e|curity
of the religion and liberties of his &s;ubjects, again&s;t
<PB N="455" REF="463">
the threatened attack by a foreign enemy, he would be
graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to order twelve battalions of his electoral
troops, together with the u&s;ual detachment of artillery, to
be forthwith brought into this kingdom. There was a
con&s;iderable party in the hou&s;e, to whom &s;uch a motion
was odious and dete&s;table: but, con&s;idering the critical
&s;ituation of affairs, they were afraid that a direct oppo&s;ition
might expo&s;e them to a more odious &s;u&s;picion: they, there|fore,
moved for the order of the day, and in&s;i&s;ted on the
que&s;tion's being put upon that motion; but it was carried
in the negative by a con&s;iderable majority, which al&s;o
agreed to the other propo&s;al. The re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e
was communicated to the Lords, who unanimou&s;ly con|curred:
and their joint addre&s;s being pre&s;ented, his Ma|je&s;ty
a&s;&s;ured them he would immediately comply with their
reque&s;t. Accordingly, &s;uch expedition was u&s;ed, that in
the cour&s;e of the next month both Hanoverians and He&s;|&s;ians
arrived in England, and encamped in different parts
of the kingdom.&mdash;As the fears of an inva&s;ion &s;ub&s;ided in the
minds of the people, their antipathy to the&s;e foreign auxili|aries
emerged. They were beheld with the eyes of jealou&s;y,
&s;u&s;picion, and di&s;dain. They were treated with contempt,
re&s;erve, and rigour. The mini&s;try was execrated for having
reduced the nation to &s;uch a low circum&s;tance of di&s;grace, as
that they &s;hould owe their &s;ecurity to German mercenaries.
There were not wanting &s;ome incendiaries, who circulated
hints and in&s;inuations, that the kingdom had been pur|po&s;ely
left unprovided; and that the natives of South-Bri|tain
had been formerly &s;ubdued and expelled by a body of
Saxon auxiliaries, whom they had hired for their pre&s;er|vation.
In a word, the doubts and &s;u&s;picions of a people
naturally blunt and jealous were inflamed to &s;uch a degree
of animo&s;ity, that nothing would have re&s;trained them
from violent acts of outrage, but the mo&s;t orderly, mode&s;t,
and inoffen&s;ive behaviour by which both the Hanoverians
and He&s;&s;ians were di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. Under the cloak of an invading armament,
which ingro&s;&s;ed the attention of the Briti&s;h nation, the
<PB N="456" REF="464">
French were actually employed in preparations for an ex|pedition,
which &s;ucceeded according to their wi&s;h. In
the beginning of the year advice was received that a French
&s;quadron would &s;oon be in a condition to &s;ail from Tou|lon:
this was afterwards confirmed by repeated intelligence,
not only from foreign gazettes, but al&s;o from Engli&s;h mi|ni&s;ters
and con&s;uls re&s;iding in Spain and Italy. They
affirmed that the Toulon &s;quadron con&s;i&s;ted of twelve or
fifteen &s;hips of the line, with a great number of tran|&s;ports;
that they were &s;upplied with provi&s;ions for two
months only, con&s;equently could not be intended for Ame|rica;
and that &s;trong bodies of troops were on their march
from different parts of the French dominions to Dauphine
and Provence, in order to be embarked. Notwith&s;tanding
the&s;e particulars, of information, which plainly pointed out
Minorca as the object of their expedition; notwith&s;tanding
the exten&s;ive and important commerce carried on by the
&s;ubjects of Great-Britain in the Mediterranean; no care
was taken to &s;end thither a &s;quadron of &s;hips capable to
protect the trade, and fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of the enemy.
That great province was left to a few incon&s;iderable &s;hips
and frigates, which could &s;erve no other purpo&s;e than that
of carrying intelligence from port to port, and enriching
their commanders, by making prize of merchant ve&s;&s;els.
Nay, the mini&s;try &s;eemed to pay little or no regard to the
remon&s;trance of General Blakeney, deputy governor of
Minorca, who, in repeated advices, repre&s;ented the weak|ne&s;s
of the garri&s;on which he commanded in St. Philip's
ca&s;tle, the chief fortre&s;s on the i&s;land. Far from
&s;trengthening the garri&s;on with a proper re-enforcement,
they did not even &s;end thither the officers belonging to it,
who were in England upon leave of ab&s;ence, nor give di|rections
for any ve&s;&s;el to tran&s;port them, until the French
armament was ready to make a de&s;cent upon that i&s;land<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is with plea&s;ure we &s;ei&s;e this opportunity of recording an in&s;tance of gallantry and patrioti&s;m in a Briti&s;h officer, which would have done honour to the character of a Roman tribune. Captain Cunningham, an accompli&s;hed young gentleman, who acted as engineer in &s;econd at Minorca, being pre|ferred to a majority at home, and recalled to his regiment by an expre&s;s order, had repaired with his family to Nice in Italy, where he waited for the opportunity of a &s;hip bound for England, when he received certain in|telligence that the French armament was de&s;tined for the place he had quit|ted. His lady, whom he tenderly loved, was ju&s;t delivered, and two of his children were dangerou&s;ly ill of the &s;mall-pox. He recollected that the chief engineer at Minorca was infirm, and indeed di&s;abled by the gout, and that many things were wanting for the defence of the fortre&s;s. His zeal for the honour and &s;ervice of his country immediately triumphed over the calls of tenderne&s;s and of nature. He expended a con&s;iderable &s;um of money in purcha&s;ing timber for the platforms, and other nece&s;&s;aries for the garri&s;on; hired a &s;hip for tran&s;porting them thither; and tearing him&s;elf from his wi&s;e and children, thus left among &s;trangers in a foreign country, embarked again for Minorca, where he knew he &s;hould be in a peculiar manner expo&s;ed to all the dangers of a furious &s;iege. In the cour&s;e of this de&s;perate &s;ervice he acquitted him&s;elf with that vigilance, &s;kill, and active courage which he had on divers $ormer occa&s;ions di&s;played, until the a&s;&s;ault was given to the Queen's-ba&s;tion, when mixing with the enemy &s;word in hand, he was di&s;$abled in his right arm by the &s;hot of a mu&s;ket and the thru&s;t of a bayon$t. His behaviour was &s;o acceptable to his &s;overeign, that when he returned to England he was preferred to the rank of colonel in the guards. He after|wards acted as chief engineer in the attempts and de&s;cents which were made on the French coa&s;t. Though grievou&s;ly maimed, he accepted the &s;ame of|fice in the expedition to Guadaloupe, where he died univer&s;ally regretted.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="457" REF="465">
&sect; VIII. At length, the de&s;tination of the enemy's fleet
being univer&s;ally known, the mini&s;try &s;eemed to rou&s;e
from their lethargy, and, like per&s;ons &s;uddenly waking,
acted with hurry and precipitation. In&s;tead of detaching
a &s;quadron that in all re&s;pects &s;hould be &s;uperior to the
French fleet in the Mediterranean, and be&s;towing the com|mand
of it upon an officer of approved courage and acti|vity,
they allotted no more than ten &s;hips of the line for
this &s;ervice, ve&s;ting the command of them in Admiral
Byng, who had never met with any occa&s;ion to &s;ignalize
his courage, and who&s;e character was not very popular in
the navy: but Mr. We&s;t, the &s;econd in command, was
a gentleman univer&s;ally re&s;pected for his probity, ability,
and re&s;olution. The ten &s;hips de&s;tined for this expedition
were but in very indifferent order, poorly manned, and
unprovided with either ho&s;pital or fire-&s;hip. They &s;ailed
from Spithead on the &s;eventh day of April, having on
board, as part of their complement, a regiment of &s;oldiers
to be landed at Gibraltar, with Major-General Stuart,
<PB N="458" REF="466">
Lord Effingham, and Colonel Cornwallis, whose regi|ments
were in garri&s;on at Minorca, about forty inferior
officers, and near one hundred recruits, as a re-enforcement
to St. Philip's fortre&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. After all the intelligence which had been received,
one would imagine the government of England was &s;till ig|norant
of the enemy's force and de&s;tination; for the in|&s;tructions
delivered to Admiral Byng imported, that, on
his arrival at Gibraltar, he &s;hould enquire whether any
French &s;quadron had pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;traits; and that,
being certified in the affirmative, as it was probably de|&s;igned
for North-America, he &s;hould immediately detach
Rear-Admiral We&s;t to Loui&s;bourg, on the i&s;land of Cape-Breton,
with &s;uch a number of &s;hips as, when joined with
tho&s;e at Hallifax, would con&s;titute a force &s;uperior to the
armament of the enemy. On the &s;econd day of May, Ad|miral
Byng arrived at Gibraltar, where he found Captain
Edgecumbe, with the Prince&s;s Loui&s;a &s;hip of war, and a
&s;loop, who informed him, that the French armament, com|manded
by M. de la Gali&s;&s;onniere, con&s;i&s;ting of thirteen
&s;hips of the line, with a great number of tran&s;ports, having
on board a body of fifteen thou&s;and land-forces, had &s;ailed
from Toulon on the tenth day of April, and made a de&s;cent
upon the i&s;land of Minorca, from whence he (Captain
Edgecumbe) had been obliged to retire at their approach.
General Fowke, who commanded at Gibraltar, had re|ceived
two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive orders from the Secretary at War
with re&s;pect to his &s;paring a battalion of troops to be tran&s;|ported
by Mr. Byng, as a re-enforcement to Minorca$
but as the two orders appeared incon&s;i&s;tent or equivocal&punc;
a council of war was con&s;ulted, and the majority were o$
opinion that no troops &s;hould be &s;ent from thence to Mi$norca,
except a detachment to &s;upply the deficiency in the
little &s;quadron o$ Captain Edgecumbe, who had left a good
number of his &s;eamen and marines, under the command of
Captain Scroop, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the defence of Fort St. Philip's $
The&s;e articles of intelligence the Admiral di&s;patched by
$an expre&s;s to the Lords of the Admiralty, and in his letter$
<PB N="459" REF="467">
made u&s;e of &s;ome impolitick expre&s;&s;ions, which, in all
probability, it would have been well for him had he omit|ted.
He &s;aid, if he had been &s;o happy as to have arrived
at Mahon before the French had landed, he flattered him|&s;elf
he &s;hould have been able to prevent their getting a
footing on that i&s;land. He complained, that there were
no magazines in Gibraltar for &s;upplying the &s;quadron with
nece&s;&s;aries; that the care$ning-wharfs, pits, and &s;tore-hou&s;es
were entirely decayed, &s;o that he &s;hould find the
greate&s;t difficulty in cleaning the &s;hips that were &s;oul;
and this was the ca&s;e with &s;ome of tho&s;e he carried out
from England, as well as with tho&s;e which had been for
&s;ome time crui&s;ing in the Mediterranean. He &s;ignified
his opinion, that, even if it &s;hould be found practicable, it
would be very impolitick to throw any men into St. Phi|lip's-ca&s;tle,
which could not be &s;aved without a land
force &s;ufficient to rai&s;e the &s;iege; therefore, a &s;mall re-en|forcement
would only add &s;o many men to the number
which mu&s;t fall into the hands of the enemy. He ob&s;erved,
that &s;uch engineers and artillery-men in Gibraltar as had
been at Minorca, were of opinion, that it would be impo&s;&s;i|ble
to throw any number of men into St. Philip's, if the
French had erected batteries on the two &s;hores near the
entrance of the harbour, &s;o as to bar all pa&s;&s;age up to the
&s;ally-port of the fortre&s;s; and with this opinion he &s;ignified
the concurrence of his own &s;entiments. The fir&s;t part of
this letter was a downright impeachment of the mini&s;try,
for having delayed the expedition, for having &s;ent out &s;hips
unfit for &s;ervice, and for having neglected the magazines
and wharfs at Gibraltar. In the latter part he &s;eemed to
prepare them for the &s;ub&s;equent account of his mi&s;conduct
and mi&s;carriage. It cannot be &s;upposed that they under|went
this accu&s;ation without apprehen&s;ion and re&s;entment;
and as they fore&s;aw the lo&s;s of Minorca, which would
not fail to excite a national clamour, perhaps they now
began to take mea&s;ures for gratifying their re&s;entment, and
transferring the blame from them&s;elves to the per&s;on who
had pre&s;umed to hint a di&s;approbation of their conduct; for
<PB N="460" REF="468">
this purpo&s;e they could not have found a fairer opporunity
than Mr. Byng's &s;ub&s;equent behaviour afforded.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The Admiral, being &s;trengthened by Mr. Edge|cumbe,
and re-enforced by a detachment from the garri&s;on,
&s;et &s;ail from Gibraltar on the eighth day of May, and was
joined off Majorca by his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Phoenix,
under the command of Captain Hervey, who confirmed the
intelligence he had already received, touching the &s;trength
and de&s;tination of the French &s;quadron. When he ap|proached
Minorca, he de&s;cried the Briti&s;h colours &s;till
flying at the ca&s;tle of St. Philip's, and &s;everal bomb batte|ries
playing upon it from different quarters, where the
French banners were di&s;played. Thus informed, he de|tached
three &s;hips a-head, with Captain Hervey, to recon|noitre
the harbour's mouth, and land, if po&s;&s;ible, a letter
for General Blakeney, giving him to under&s;tand the fleet
was come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Before this attempt could be
made, the French fleet appearing to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and the
wind blowing &s;trong off &s;hore, he recalled his &s;hips, and
formed the line of battle. About &s;ix o'clock in the even|ing,
the enemy, to the number of &s;eventeen &s;hips, thirteen
of which appeared to be very large, advanced in order; but
about &s;even tacked, with a view to gain the weather-gage.
Mr. Byng, in order to pre&s;erve that advantage, as well as
to make &s;ure of the land-wind in the morning, followed
their example, being then about five leagues from Cape-Mola.
At day light the enemy could not be de&s;cribed; but
two tartanes appearing clo&s;e to the rear of the Engli&s;h &s;qua|dron,
they were immediately cha&s;ed by &s;ignal. One
e&s;caped, and the other being taken, was found to have on
board two French captains, two lieutenants, and about one
hundred private &s;oldiers, part of &s;ix hundred who had been
&s;ent out in tartanes the preceding day, to re-enforce the
enemy's &s;quadron. This &s;oon re-appearing, the line of
battle was formed on each &s;ide, and about two o'clock
Admiral Byng threw out a &s;ignal to bear away two points
from the wind and engage. At this time his di&s;tance from
the enemy was &s;o great, that Rear-Admiral We&s;t, per|ceiving
<PB N="461" REF="469">
it impo&s;&s;ible to comply with both orders, bore away
with his divi&s;ion &s;even points from the wind, and clo&s;ing
down upon the enemy, attacked them with &s;uch impetu|o&s;ity,
that the &s;hips which oppo&s;ed him were in a little time
driven out of the line. Had he been properly &s;u&s;tained by
the van, in all probability the Briti&s;h fleet would have ob|tained
a complete victory; but the other divi&s;ion did not
bear down, and the enemy's centre keeping their &s;tation,
Rear-Admiral We&s;t could not pur&s;ue his advantage with|out
running the ri&s;que of &s;eeing his communication with
the re&s;t of the line entirely cut off. In the beginning of
the action, the Intrepid, in Mr. Byng's divi&s;ion, was &s;o
di&s;abled in her rigging, that &s;he could not be managed, and
drove on the &s;hip that was next in po&s;ition: a circum&s;tance
which obliged &s;everal others to throw all a-back, in order to
avoid confu&s;ion, and for &s;ome time retarded the action.
Certain it is, that Mr. Byng, though accommodated with
a noble &s;hip of ninety guns, made little or no u&s;e of his
artillery, but kept aloof, either from an over&s;trained ob|&s;ervance
of di&s;cipline, or timidity. When his captain ex|horted
him to bear down upon the enemy, he very coolly
replied, that he would avoid the error of Admiral Matthews,
who, in his engagement with the French and Spani&s;h &s;qua|drons
off Toulon, during the preceding war, had broke
the line by his own precipitation, and expo&s;ed him&s;elf
&s;ingly to a fire that he could not &s;u&s;tain. Mr. Byng, on
the contrary, was determined again&s;t acting, except with
the line entire; and, on pretence of rectifying the di&s;order
which had happened among &s;ome of the &s;hips, he&s;itated &s;o
long, and kept at &s;uch a wary di&s;tance, that he never was
properly engaged, though he received &s;ome few &s;hots in his
bull. M. de la Gali&s;&s;onniere &s;eemed equally aver&s;e to the
continuance of the battle: part of his &s;quadron had been
fairly obliged to quit the line; and though he was rather
&s;uperior to the Engli&s;h in number of men and weight of
metal, he did not choo&s;e to abide the con&s;equence of a clo&s;er
fight with an enemy &s;o expert in naval operations: he,
therefore, took advantage of Mr. Byng's he&s;itation, and
<PB N="462" REF="470">
edged away with an ea&s;y &s;ail to join his van, which had
been di&s;comfited. The Engli&s;h Admiral gave cha&s;e, but
the French &s;hips being clean, he could not come up and
clo&s;e them again, &s;o they retired at their lei&s;ure. Then he
put his &s;quadron on the other tack, in order to keep the
wind of the enemy; and next morning they were altoge|ther
our of &s;ight.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. While he lay to with the re&s;t of his fleet, at the
di&s;tance of ten leagues from Mahon, he detached crui&s;ers to
look for &s;ome mi&s;&s;ing &s;hips, which joined him accordingly,
and made an enquiry into the condition of the &s;quadron.
The number of killed amounted to forty-two, including
Captain Andrews, of the Defiance, and about one hundred
and &s;ixty-eight were wounded. Three of the capital &s;hips
were &s;o damaged in their ma&s;ts, that they could not keep
the &s;ea, with any regard to their &s;afety: a great number of
the &s;eamen were ill, and there was no ve&s;&s;el which could
be converted into an ho&s;pital for the &s;ick and wounded.
In this &s;ituation Mr. Byng called a council of war, at
which the land officers were pre&s;ent. He repre&s;ented to
them, that he was much inferior to the enemy in weight
of metal and number of men; that they had the advan|tage
of &s;ending their wounded to Minorca, from whence
at the &s;ame time they were refre&s;hed and re-enforced occa|&s;ionally;
that, in his opinion, it was impracticable to relieve
St. Philip's fort, and, therefore, they ought to make the
be&s;t of their way back to Gibraltar, which might require
$mmediate protection. They unanimou&s;ly concurred with
his &s;entiments, and thither he directed his cour&s;e accordingly.
How he came to be &s;o well acquainted with the impractica|bility
of relieving General Blakeney it is not ea&s;y to de|termine,
as no experiment was made for that purpo&s;e.
Indeed, the neglect of &s;uch a trial &s;eems to have been the
lea&s;t excu&s;eable part of his conduct; for it afterwards ap|peared,
that the officers and &s;oldiers belonging to the gar|ri&s;on
might have been landed at the &s;ally-port, without
running any great ri&s;que; and a gentleman, then in the
<PB N="463" REF="471">
fort, actually pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed in a boat, unhurt by
any of the enemy's batteries.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. Mr. Byng's letter to the Admiralty, containing
a detail of this action, is &s;aid to have arrived &s;ome days be|fore
it was made publick; and when it appeared, was cur|tailed
of divers expre&s;&s;ions, and whole paragraphs, which
either tended to his own ju&s;tification, or implied a cen&s;ure
on the conduct of his &s;uperiors. Whatever u&s;e might have
been made of this letter while it remained a &s;ecret to the
publick we &s;hall not pretend to explain: but &s;ure it is,
that, on the &s;ixteenth day of June, Sir Edward Hawke and
Admiral Saunders &s;ailed from Spithead to Gibraltar, to
&s;uper&s;ede the Admirals Byng and We&s;t, in their commands
of the Mediterranean &s;quadron; and Mr. Byng's letter was
not publi&s;hed till the twenty-&s;ixth day of the &s;ame month,
when it produced all the effect which that gentleman's bit|tere&s;t
enemies could have de&s;ired. The populace took fire
like a train of the mo&s;t ha&s;ty combu&s;tibles, and broke out
into &s;uch a clamour of rage and indignation again&s;t the de|voted
Admiral, as could not have been exceeded if he had
lo&s;t the whole navy of England, and left the coa&s;ts of the
kingdom naked to inva&s;ion. This animo&s;ity was carefully
fomented and maintained by artful emi&s;&s;aries, who mingled
with all publick a&s;&s;emblies, from the drawing room at St.
James's to the mob at Charing-cro&s;s. They expatiated
upon the in&s;olence, the folly, the cowardice, and mi&s;con|duct
of the unhappy Admiral. They even pre&s;umed to
make their &s;overeign in &s;ome mea&s;ure an in&s;trument of their
calumny, by &s;ugge&s;ting that his Maje&s;ty had progno&s;ticated
Byng's mi&s;behaviour from the contents of his fir&s;t letter,
dated at Gibraltar. They ridiculed and refuted the rea&s;ons
he had given for returning to that fortre&s;s, after his &s;can|dalous
rencounter with the French &s;quadron; and, in order
to exa&s;perate them to the mo&s;t implacable re&s;entment, they
exaggerated the terrible con&s;equences of lo&s;ing Minorca,
which mu&s;t now be &s;ubdued through his treachery or want
of re&s;olution. In a word, he was devoted as the &s;cape|goat
of the mini&s;try, to who&s;e &s;upine negligence, ignorance,
<PB N="464" REF="472">
and mi&s;conduct the lo&s;s of that important fortre&s;s was un|doubtedly
owing. Byng's mi&s;carriage was thrown out like
a barrel to the whale, in order to engage the attention of
the people, that it might not be attracted by the real cau&s;e
of the national misfortune. In order to keep up the flame
which had been kindled again&s;t the Admiral, recour&s;e was
had to the lowe&s;t artifices. Agents were employed to vilify
his per&s;on in all publick places of vulgar re&s;ort; and mobs
were hired at different parts of the capital to hang and
burn him in effigy.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. The two officers who &s;ucceeded to the com|mand
in the Mediterranean were accompanied by Lord
Tyrawley, whom his maje&s;ty had appointed to &s;uper&s;ede
General Fowke in the government of Gibraltar, that gen|tleman
having incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of the mini&s;try, for
not having under&s;tood an order which was unintelligible.
By the &s;ame conveyance, a letter from the &s;ecretary to the
Admiralty was tran&s;mitted to Mr. Byng, giving him
notice that he was recalled. To this intimation he replied
in &s;uch a manner as denoted a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done
his duty, and a laudable de fire to vindicate his own con|duct.
His an&s;wer contained a further account of the en|gagement
in which he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have mi&s;behaved,
intermixed with &s;ome puerile calculations of the enemy's
&s;uperiority in weight of metal, which &s;erved no other pur|po&s;e
than that of expo&s;ing his character &s;till more to ridicule
and abu&s;e; and he was again &s;o impolitick as to hazard
certain expre&s;&s;ions, which added fre&s;h fuel to the re&s;entment
of his enemies. Directions were immediately di&s;patched
to Sir Edward Hawke, that Byng &s;hould be &s;ent home in
arre&s;t: and an order to the &s;ame purpo&s;e was lodged at every
port in the kingdom: precautions, which, however unne|ce&s;&s;ary
to &s;ecure the per&s;on of a man who longed ardently
to ju&s;tify his character by a publick tryal, were yet pro|ductive
of con&s;iderable effect in augmenting the popular
odium. Admiral Byng immediately embarked in the &s;hip
which had carried out his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and was accompanied
by Mr. We&s;t, General Fowke, and &s;everal other officers of
<PB N="465" REF="473">
that garri&s;on, who were al&s;o recalled, in con&s;equence of
having &s;ub&s;cribed to the re&s;ult of the council of war, which
we have mentioned above. When they arrived in Eng|land,
Mr. We&s;t met with &s;uch a gracious reception from
his Maje&s;ty as was thought due to his extraordinary me|rit;
but Mr. Byng was committed clo&s;e pri&s;oner in an
apartment of Greenwich-Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. In the mean time, the &s;iege of St. Philip's fort
in Minorca was pro&s;ecuted with unremitting vigour. The
a$mament of Toulon, con&s;i&s;ting of the fleet commanded by
M. de la Gali&s;&s;onniere, and the troops under the Duke de
Richelieu, arrived on the eighteenth day of April at the
port of Ciudadella, on that part of the i&s;land oppo&s;ite to
Mahon, or St. Philip's, and immediately began to di&s;em|bark
their forces. Two days before they reached the
i&s;land, General Blakeney had, by a packet-boat, received
certain intelligence of their approach, and began to make
preparations for the defence of the ca&s;tle. The fort which
he commanded was very exten&s;ive, &s;urrounded with nu|merous
redoubts, ravelines, and other outworks; and pro|vided
with &s;ubterranean galleries, mines, and traver&s;es, cut
out of the &s;olid rock with incredible labour. Upon the
whole, this was one of the be&s;t fortified places in Europe,
well &s;upplied with artillery, ammunition, and provi&s;ion;
and, without all doubt, might have &s;u&s;tained the mo&s;t
de&s;perate &s;iege, had it been defended by a numerous gar|ri&s;on,
conducted by able engineers, under the eye and
au&s;pices of an active and &s;kilful commander. All the&s;e
advantages, however, did not concur on this occa&s;ion.
The number of troops in Minorea did not exceed four re|giments,
whereas, the nature of the works required at lea&s;t
double the number; and, even of the&s;e above forty officers
were ab&s;ent. The chief engineer was rendered lame by
the gout, and the general him&s;elf oppre&s;&s;ed with the in|firmities
of old age. The natives of the i&s;land might have
been &s;erviceable as pioneers, or day-labourers; but, from
their hatred to the prote&s;tant religion, they were generally
<PB N="466" REF="474">
aver&s;e to the Engli&s;h government, although they had lived
happily and grown wealthy under its influence.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. The governor ordered his officers to beat up for
volunteers in the adjacent town of St. Philip's; but few
or none would inli&s;t under his banners, and it &s;eems he
would not venture to compel them into the &s;ervice. He
recalled all his advanced parties; and, in particular, a
company po&s;ted at Fornelles, where a &s;mall redoubt had
been rai&s;ed, and five companies at Ciudadella, a po&s;t for|tified
with two pieces of cannon, which were now with|drawn,
as &s;oon as the enemy began to di&s;embark their
forces. At the &s;ame time Major Cunningham was de|tached
with a party to break down the bridges, and break
up the roads between that place and St. Philip's; but the
ta&s;k of de&s;troying the roads could not be performed in &s;uch
a hurry, on account of the hard rock which runs along the
&s;urface of the ground through this whole i&s;land; nor was
there time to demoli&s;h the town of St. Philip's, which
&s;tood &s;o near the fort, that the enemy could not fail to take
advantage of its neighbourhood. The &s;treets &s;erved them
for trenches, which otherwi&s;e could not have been dug
through the &s;olid rock. Here they made a lodgement
clo&s;e to the works; here they found convenient barracks
and quarters of refre&s;hment, ma&s;ks for their batteries, and
an effectual cover for their mortars and bombardiers. The
general has been blamed for leaving the town &s;tanding;
but if we con&s;ider his uncertainty concerning the de&s;tina|tion
of the French armament, the odious nature of &s;uch
a precaution, which could not fail to exa&s;perate the inha|bitants,
and the impo&s;&s;ibility of executing &s;uch a &s;cheme
after the fir&s;t appearance of the enemy, he will be found
excu&s;eable, if not altogether blamele&s;s. Some hou&s;es and
windmills were actually demoli&s;hed, &s;o as to clear the
e&s;planade and the approaches. All the wine in the cellars
of St. Philip's town was de&s;troyed, and the butts were car|ried
into the ca&s;tle, where they might &s;erve for gabions
and traver&s;es. Five-and-twenty Minorquin bakers were
hired, and a large number of cattle brought into the $sort,
<PB N="467" REF="475">
for the benefit of the garri&s;on. The ports were walled up,
the po&s;t, a&s;&s;igned, the &s;entinels placed, and all the different
guards appointed. Commodore Edgecumbe, who then
anchored in the harbour of Mahon, clo&s;e under the walls
of the ca&s;tle, &s;ailed away with his little &s;quadron, con&s;i&s;t|ing
of the Che&s;terfield, Prince&s;s Loui&s;a, Portland, and
Dolphin, after having left all his marines, a detachment
from Gibraltar, the whole crew of the Porcupine &s;loop, and
the greater part of the Dolphin's, as re-enforcement to the
fort, under the immediate direction and command of Capt.
Scroop, of the Dolphin, who, with great gallantry,
offered him&s;elf for this &s;evere duty, and bravely &s;ignali&s;ed
him&s;elf during the whole &s;iege. The French admiral
might certainly have blocked up this harbour in &s;uch
a manner as would have prevented the e&s;cape of the&s;e &s;hips,
and divers other rich merchant ve&s;&s;els, which happened
then to be at Mahon: but, in all probability, they pur|po&s;ely
allowed them to abandon the place, which, on any
emergency or a&s;&s;ault, their crews and officers would have
con&s;iderably re-enforced. The enemy were prefectly ac|quainted
with the great extent of the works, and the weak|nets
of the garri&s;on; from which circum&s;tances they derived
the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes that the place might be &s;uddenly
taken, without the trouble of a regular &s;iege. After Mr.
Edgecumbe had &s;ailed for Gibraltar, and General Blakeney
had ordered a &s;loop to be &s;unk in the channel that leads to
the harbour, the French &s;quadron made its appearance at
this part of the i&s;land; but, without having attempted any
thing again&s;t the fort, &s;ell to the leeward of Cape-Mola.
Next day they came in &s;ight again, but &s;oon bore away, and
never afterwards, during the whole cour&s;e of the &s;iege, ap|proached
&s;o near as to give the garri&s;on the lea&s;t di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. On the twenty-&s;econd day of April, the gover|nor
&s;ent a drummer to the French general, with a letter, de|&s;iring
to know his rea&s;ons for invading the i&s;land. To this an
an&s;wer was returned by the Duke de Richelieu, declaring
he was come with intention to reduce the i&s;land under the
dominion of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, by way of re|taliation
<PB N="468" REF="476">
for the conduct of his ma&s;ter, who had &s;ei&s;ed and
detained the &s;hips belonging to the King of France and his
&s;ubjects.&mdash;If we may judge from the fir&s;t operation of this
nobleman, he was but indifferently provided with en|gineers;
for, in&s;tead of beginning his approaches on the
&s;ide of St. Philip's town, clo&s;e by the outworks, where
he might have been &s;creened from the fire of the garri&s;on,
his batteries were erected at Cape Mola, on the other &s;ide
of the harbour, where they were more expo&s;ed, their fire
much le&s;s effectual, and indeed at too great a di&s;tance to
be of any &s;ervice. The fire of St. Philip's was &s;o &s;evere,
and the cannon &s;o well &s;erved on this quarter, that in a
little time the enemy thought proper to change their plan
of attack, and advance on the &s;ide of St. Philip's town,
which ought to have been the fir&s;t object of their con&s;ider|ation,
e&s;pecially as they could find little or no earth to fill
their gabions, and open their trenches in the u&s;ual form.
On the twelfth of May, about nine at night, they opened
two bomb batteries, near the place where the windmills had
been de&s;troyed; and from that period an ince&s;&s;ant fire was
kept up on both &s;ides, from mortars and cannon, the
French continuing to rai&s;e new batteries in every &s;ituation
from whence they could annoy the be&s;ieged.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. On the &s;eventeenth day of the month the garri|&s;on
were tran&s;ported with joy at &s;ight of the Briti&s;h &s;qua|dron,
commanded by Admiral Byng; and Mr. Boyd,
commi&s;&s;ary of the &s;tores, ventured to embark in a &s;mall
boat, with &s;ix oars, which pa&s;&s;ed from St. Stephen's cove,
a creek on the we&s;t &s;ide of the fortification, through a
&s;hower of cannon and mu&s;ketry from the enemy's po&s;t on
the other &s;ide, and actually reached the open $ea, his de|&s;ign
being to join the &s;quadron; but this being at a great
di&s;tance, &s;tretching away to the &s;outhward, and Mr. Boyd
perceiving him&s;elf cha&s;ed by two of the enemy's light
ve&s;&s;els, he returned by the &s;ame route to the garri&s;on,
without having &s;u&s;tained the lea&s;t damage. A circum|&s;tance
which plainly confutes the notion of Mr. Byng,
that it was impracticable to open a communication with
<PB N="469" REF="477">
the garri&s;on of St. Philip's. Next day the hopes of the be|&s;ieged,
which had progno&s;ticated a naval victory to the
Briti&s;h &s;quadron, a &s;peedy relief to them&s;elves, and no
le&s;s than captivity to the a&s;&s;ailants, were con&s;iderably
damped by the appearance of the French fleet, which
quietly returned to their &s;tation off the harbour of Mahon.
That &s;ame evening they were told by a de&s;erter, that the
Engli&s;h fleet had been wor&s;ted in an engagement by M|de
la Gali&s;&s;onniere; and this information was &s;oon con|firmed
by a general di&s;charge, or <HI>feu de joie,</HI> through the
whole French camp, to celebrate the victory they pretended
to have obtained. How little &s;oever they had rea&s;on to
boa&s;t of any advantage in the action, the retreat of the
Engli&s;h &s;quadron was undoubtedly equivalent to a victory:
for had Mr. Byng acquired and maintained the &s;uperiority
at &s;ea, the French forces, which had been di&s;embarked in
Minorca, would, in all probability, have been obliged to
&s;urrender pri&s;oners of war to his Britannick Maje&s;ty.
The ca&s;e was now much altered in their favour: their
&s;quadron crui&s;ed about the i&s;land without mole&s;tation:
and they daily received, by means of their tran&s;ports, re|enforcements
of men and ammunition, as well as con&s;tant
&s;upplies of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The Engli&s;h garri&s;on, however mortified at
finding them&s;elves thus abandoned, re&s;olved to acquit them|&s;elves
with gallantry in the defence of the place, not with|out
&s;ome remaining hope that the Engli&s;h &s;quadron would
be re-enforced, and return to their relief. In the mean
time, they &s;u&s;tained and retorted the enemy's fire with
undaunted re&s;olution. They remounted cannon, the
carriages of which had been di&s;abled: they removed them
occa&s;ionally to places from whence it was judged they
could do the greate&s;t execution: they repaired breaches,
re&s;tored merlons, and laboured with &s;urpri&s;ing alacrity,
even when they were &s;urrounded by the numerous batteries
of the foe; when their embra&s;ures, and even the para|pets,
were demoli&s;hed, and they &s;tood expo&s;ed not only
to the cannon and mortars, but al&s;o to the mu&s;quetry, which
<PB N="470" REF="478">
fired upon them, without cea&s;ing, from the windows of
the hou&s;es in the town of St. Philip. By this time, they
were inve&s;ted with an army of twenty thou&s;and men, and
plyed ince&s;&s;antly from &s;ixty-two battering cannon, twenty-one
mortars, and four howitzers, be&s;ides the &s;mall arms:
neverthele&s;s, the lo&s;s of men within the fortre&s;s was very
incon&s;iderable, the garri&s;on being mo&s;tly &s;ecured in the
&s;ubterranean works, which were impenetrable to &s;hells or
&s;hot. By the twenty &s;eventh day of June they had made a
practicable breach in one of the ravelins, and damaged the
other outworks to &s;uch a degree, that they determined this
night to give a general a&s;&s;ault. Accordingly, between the
hours of ten and eleven, they advanced to the attack from
all quarters on the land-&s;ide. At the &s;ame time a &s;trong
detachment, in armed boats, attempted to force the har|bour,
and penetrate into the creek, called St. Stephen's
Cove, to &s;torm Fort-Charles, and &s;econd the attack upon
Fort Marlborough, on the farther &s;ide of the creek, the
mo&s;t detached of all the outworks. The enemy advanced
with great intrepidity, and their commander, the Duke
de Richelieu, is &s;aid to have led them up to the works
in per&s;on. Such an a&s;&s;ault could not but be attended with
great &s;laughter: they were mowed down, as they approach|ed,
with grape-&s;hot and mu&s;quetry: and &s;everal mines were
&s;prung with great effect, &s;o that the glacis was almo&s;t
covered with the dying and the dead. Neverthele&s;s, they
per&s;evered with uncommon re&s;olution; and, though re|pul&s;ed
on every other &s;ide, at length made a lodgement in
the Queen's redoubt, which had been greatly damaged
by their cannon. Whether their &s;ucce&s;s in this quarter
was owing to the weakne&s;s of the place, or to the timidity
of the defender, certain it is, the enemy were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
before it was known to the officers of the garri&s;on; for
Lieutenant-Colonel Jeffries, the &s;econd in command, who
had acquitted him &s;elf &s;ince the beginning of the &s;iege with
equal courage, &s;kill, and activity, in his vi&s;itation of this
po&s;t, was &s;uddenly &s;urrounded and taken by a file of
French grenadiers, at a time when he never dreamed they
<PB N="471" REF="479">
had made a lodgment. Major Cunningham, who ac|companied
him, met with a &s;everer fate, though he e&s;|caped
capitivity: he was run through the arm with a
bayonet, and the piece being di&s;charged at the &s;ame time,
&s;hattered the bones of his hand in &s;uch a manner, that he
was maimed for life. In this &s;hocking condition he re|tired
behind a traver&s;e, and was carried home to his quar|ters.
Thus the governor was deprived of his two princi|pal
a&s;&s;i&s;tants, one being taken, and the other di&s;abled.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. The enemy having made them&s;elves ma&s;ters
of An&s;truther's and the Queen's redoubts, from which
perhaps they might have been di&s;lodged, had a vigorous
effort been made for that purpo&s;e, before they had lei&s;ure
to &s;ecure them&s;elves, the Duke de Richelieu ordered a par|ley
to be beat, in order to obtain permi&s;&s;ion to bury the
dead, and remove the wounded. This reque&s;t was granted
with more humanity than di&s;cretion, ina&s;much as the
enemy took this opportunity to throw a re-enforcement of
men privately into the places where the lodgements had
been made, and the&s;e penetrated into the gallery of the
mines, which communicated with all the other outworks.
During this &s;hort ce&s;&s;ation, General Blakeney &s;ummoned
a council of war, to deliberate upon the &s;tate of the fort
and garri&s;on: and the majority declared for a capitulation.
The works were in many places ruined; the body of the
ca&s;tle was &s;hattered; many guns were di&s;mounted, the em|bra&s;ures
and parapets demoli&s;hed, the palli&s;adoes broke in
pieces, the garri&s;on exhau&s;ted with hard duty and ince&s;&s;ant
watching, and the enemy in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubterranean
communications. Be&s;ides, the governor had received in|formation
from pri&s;oners, that the Duke de Richelieu was
alarmed by a report that the Mar&s;hal Duke de Bellei&s;le
would be &s;ent to &s;uper&s;ede him in the command, and for
that rea&s;on would hazard another de&s;perate a&s;&s;ault, which
it was the opinion of the majority the garri&s;on could not
&s;u&s;tain. The&s;e con&s;iderations, added to the de&s;pair of
being relieved, induced him to demand a capitulation.
But this mea&s;ure was not taken with the unanimous con|&s;ent
<PB N="472" REF="480">
of the council. Some officers ob&s;erved, that the
garri&s;on was very little dimini&s;hed, and &s;till in good
&s;pirits: that no breach was made in the body of the ca&s;tle,
nor a &s;ingle cannon erected to batter in breach: that the
lo&s;s of an outwork was never deemed a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for
&s;urrendering &s;uch a fortre&s;s; that the counter&s;carp was
not yet taken, nor, on account of the rocky &s;oil, could be
taken, except by a&s;&s;ault, which would co&s;t the enemy a
greater number than they had lo&s;t in their late attempt:
that they could not attack the ditch, or batter in breach,
before the counter&s;carp &s;hould be taken, and even then
they mu&s;t have recour&s;e to galleries before they could pa&s;s
the fo&s;&s;&eacute;, which was furni&s;hed with mines and counter|mines:
finally, they &s;ugge&s;ted, that in all probability
the Briti&s;h &s;quadron would be re-enforced, and &s;ail back
to their relief; or, if it &s;hould not return, it was the
duty of the governor to defend the place to extremity,
without having any regard to the con&s;equences. The&s;e
remarks being over-ruled, the chamade was beat, a con|ference
en&s;ued, and very honourable conditions were
granted to the garri&s;on, in con&s;ideration of the gallant de|fence
they had made. This it mu&s;t be owned was vigorous
while it la&s;ted, as the French general was &s;aid to have lo&s;t
five thou&s;and men in the &s;iege: whereas the lo&s;s of the
garri&s;on, which at fir&s;t fell &s;hort of three thou&s;and men,
did not exceed one hundred. The capitulation imported
that the garri&s;on &s;hould march out with all the honours of
war, and be conveyed by &s;ea to Gibraltar. The French
were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one gate, as well as Fort Charles
and Marlborough redoubt; but the Engli&s;h troops re|mained
in the other works till the &s;eventh day of July,
when they embarked. In the mean time, reciprocal civi|lities
pa&s;&s;ed between the commanders and officers of both
nations.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. The articles of capitulation were no &s;ooner ex|ecuted
than Mon&s;ieur de la Gali&s;&s;onniere &s;ailed back to
Toulon, with all the prizes which had lain at anchor in
the harbour of Mahon &s;ince the fort of St. Philip was fir&s;t
<PB N="473" REF="481">
inve&s;ted. In all probability the &s;afety of him&s;elf and his
whole &s;quadron was owing to this expeditious retreat; for
in a few days after the &s;urrender of the fort, Sir Edward
Hawke's fleet, augmented by five &s;hips of the line, which
had been &s;ent from England, when the fir&s;t tidings ar|rived
of Minorca's being invaded, now made its appear|ance
off the i&s;land; but by this time Gali&s;&s;onniere was re|tired,
and the Engli&s;h admiral had the mortification to
&s;ee the French colours flying upon St. Philip's ca&s;tle.
What, perhaps, chagrined this gallant officer &s;till more,
he was not provided with frigates, &s;loops, and &s;mall craft
to crui&s;e round the i&s;land, and intercept the &s;upplies which
were daily &s;ent to the enemy. Had he reached Minorca
&s;ooner, he might have di&s;comfited the French &s;quadron;
but he could not have rai&s;ed the &s;iege of St. Philip's,, be|cau&s;e
the Duke de Richelieu had received his re-enforce|ments,
and &s;uch a train of artillery as no fortification could
long with&s;tand. Indeed, if the garri&s;on had been con|&s;iderably
re-enforced, and the communication with it
opened by &s;ea, the defence would have been protracted,
and &s;o many vigorous &s;allies might have been made, that
the a&s;&s;ailants would have had cau&s;e to repent of their en|terpri&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. When the news of the conque&s;t was brought
to Ver&s;ailles, by the Court of Egmont, whom the Duke
de Richelieu had di&s;patched for that purpo&s;e, the people of
France were tran&s;ported with the mo&s;t extravagant joy.
Nothing was &s;een but triumphs and proce&s;&s;ions; nothing
heard but anthems, congratulations, and hyperbolical
encomiums upon the conqueror of Minorca, who was
celebrated in a thou&s;and poems and &s;tudied orations;
while the conduct of the Engli&s;h was vilified and ridiculed
in ballads, farces, and pa&s;quinades. Nothing more argues
the degeneracy of a warlike nation than the pride of &s;uch
mean triumph for an advantage, which, in more vigorous
times, would &s;carce have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the cere|mony
of a <HI>Te Deum Laudamus.</HI> Nor is this childi&s;h ex|ultation,
that di&s;graces the laurels of victory, confined to
<PB N="474" REF="482">
the kingdom of France. Truth obliges us to own, that
even the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain are apt to be elevated
by &s;ucce&s;s into an illiberal in&s;olence of &s;elf applau&s;e, and
contemptuous compari&s;on. This mu&s;t be condemned as
a proof of unmanly arrogance, and ab&s;urd &s;elf-conceit, by
all tho&s;e who coolly reflect, that the events of war gene|rally,
if not always, depend upon the genius or mi&s;conduct
of one individual. The lo&s;s of Minorca was &s;everely felt
in England, as a national di&s;grace; but, in&s;tead of pro|ducing
dejection and de&s;pondence, it excited an univer&s;al
clamour of rage and re&s;entment, not only again&s;t Mr.
Byng, who had retreated from the French &s;quadron; but
al&s;o in reproach of the admini&s;tration, which was taxed
with having neglected the &s;ecurity of Minorca. Nay,
&s;ome politicians were inflamed into a &s;u&s;picion, that this im|portant
place had been negatively betrayed into the hands
of the enemy, that, in ca&s;e the arms of Great-Britain
&s;hould pro&s;per in other parts of the world, the French
King might have &s;ome $ort of equivalent to re&s;tore for
the conque&s;ts which &s;hould be abandoned at the peace.
This notion, however, &s;eems to have been conceived from
prejudice and party, which now began to appear with the
mo&s;t acrimonious a&s;pect, not only throughout the united
kingdoms in general, but even in the &s;&mdash;n's councils.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. Sir Edward Hawke, being di&s;appointed in his
hope of encountering La Gali&s;&s;onniere, and relieving the
Engli&s;h garri&s;on of St. Philip's, at lea&s;t a&s;&s;erted the em|pire
of Great-Britain in the Mediterranean, by annoying
the commerce of the enemy, and blocking up their &s;qua|dron
in the harbour of Toulon. Under&s;tanding that the
Au&s;trian government at Leghorn had detained an Engli&s;h
privateer, and impri&s;oned the captain, on pretence that he
had violated the neutrality of the port, he detached two
&s;hips of war, to in&s;i&s;t, in a peremptory manner, on the re|lea&s;e
of the &s;hip, effects, crew, and captain; and they
thought proper to comply with his demands, even without
waiting for orders from the court of Vienna. The per&s;on
in who&s;e behalf the Admiral thus interpo&s;ed, was one
<PB N="475" REF="483">
Fortunatis Wright, a native of Liverpool; who, though
a &s;tranger to a &s;ea-life, had, in the la&s;t war, equipped a
privateeer, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, by
his uncommon vigilance and valour, that, if he had been
indulged with a command &s;uitable to his genius, he would
have de&s;erved as honourable a place in the annals of the
navy, as that which the French have be&s;towed upon their
boa&s;ted Guai Trouin, Du Bart, and Thurot. An un|common
exertion of &s;pirit was the occa&s;ion of his being
detained at this juncture. While he lay at anchor in the
harbour of Leghorn, commander of the St. George pri|vateer
of Liverpool, a &s;mall &s;hip of twelve guns and eighty
men, a large French xebeque, mounted with &s;ix|teen
cannon, and nearly three times the number of his
complement, cho&s;e her &s;tation in view of the harbour, in
order to interrupt the Briti&s;h commerce. The gallant
Wright could not endure this in&s;ult: notwith&s;tanding the
enemy's &s;uperiority in metal and number of men, he
weighed anchor, hoi&s;ted his &s;ails, engaged him within
&s;ight of the &s;hore, and after a very ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, in
which the captain, lieutenant, and above three&s;core of the
men belonging to the xebeque were killed on the &s;pot, he
obliged them to &s;heer off, and returned to the harbour in
triumph. This brave cor&s;air would, no doubt, have &s;igna|li&s;ed
him&s;elf by many other exploits, had not he, in the &s;equel,
been overtaken in the mid&s;t of his career by a dreadful &s;torm,
in which the &s;hip foundering, he and all his crew peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. Sir Edward Hawke, having &s;coured the Me|diterranean,
and in&s;ulted the enemy's ports, returned with
the homeward-bound trade to Gibraltar; from whence,
about the latter end of the year, he &s;et &s;ail for England
with part of his &s;quadron, leaving the re&s;t in that bay, for
the protection of our commerce, which in tho&s;e parts
&s;oon began to &s;uffer extremely from French privateers,
that now &s;warmed in the Mediterranean. General Blake|ney
had arrived, with the garri&s;on of Minorca, at Port&s;|mouth
in the month of November, and been received with
expre&s;&s;ions of tumultuous joy: every place through which
<PB N="476" REF="484">
he pa&s;&s;ed celebrated his return with bonefires, illuminations,
bell-ringing, and acclamations: every mouth was opened
in his prai&s;e, extolling him for the gallant defence he had
made in the ca&s;tle of St. Philip. In a word, the people's
veneration for Blakeney increa&s;ed in proportion to their
abhorrence of Byng: the fir&s;t was lifted into an idol of
admiration, while the other &s;unk into an object of reproach;
and they were viewed at different ends of a fal&s;e per&s;pective,
through the medium of prejudice and pa&s;&s;ion; of a per&s;pective
artfully contrived, and applied by certain m&mdash;rs for
the purpo&s;es of &s;elf-intere&s;t and deceit. The &s;&mdash;is
&s;aid to have been influenced by the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
&s;&mdash;t. Mr. Blakeney met with a gracious reception
from his Maje&s;ty, who rai&s;ed him to the rank of an Iri&s;h
baron, in con&s;ideration of his faithful &s;ervices, while &s;ome
malcontents murmured at this mark of favour, as an un|rea&s;onable
&s;acrifice to popular mi&s;apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. In the beginning of the year, the mea&s;ures
taken by the government in England &s;eem to have been
chiefly dictated by the dread of an inva&s;ion, from which
the mini&s;ters did not think them&s;elves &s;ecured by the
guard-&s;hips and crui&s;ers on different parts of the coa&s;t, or
the &s;tanding army of the kingdom, though re-enforced by
the two bodies of German auxiliaries. A con&s;iderable
number of new troops was levied: the &s;ucce&s;s in recruiting
was not only promoted by the land-holders throughout the
kingdom, who thought their e&s;tates were at &s;take, and for
that rea&s;on encouraged their dependants to engage in the
&s;ervice, but al&s;o in a great mea&s;ure owing to a dearth of
corn, which reduced the lower cla&s;s of labourers to &s;uch
di&s;tre&s;s, that &s;ome in&s;urrections were rai&s;ed, and many
inli&s;ted with a view to obtain a livelihood, which otherwi&s;e
they could not earn. New &s;hips of war were built, and
daily put in commi&s;&s;ion; but it was found impracticable
to man them, without having recour&s;e to the odious and
illegal practice of impre&s;&s;ing &s;ailors, which mu&s;t always be
a reproach to every free people. Notwith&s;tanding large
bounties, granted by the government to volunteers, it was
<PB N="477" REF="485">
found nece&s;&s;ary to lay an embargo upon all &s;hipping, and
impre&s;s all the &s;eamen that could be found, without any
regard to former protections; &s;o that all the merchant-&s;hips
were &s;tripped of their hands, and foreign commerce for
&s;ome time wholly &s;u&s;pended. Nay, the expedient
of compelling men into the &s;ervice was carried to an
unu&s;ual degree of oppre&s;&s;ion; for rewards were publickly
offered to tho&s;e who &s;hould di&s;cover where any &s;eaman lay
concealed: &s;o that tho&s;e unhappy people were in &s;ome re|&s;pects
treated like felons, dragged from their families and
connexions to confinement, mutilation, and death, and
totally cut off from the enjoyment of that liberty, which,
perhaps, at the expen&s;e of their lives, their own arms had
helped to pre&s;erve, in favour of their ungrateful country<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">At this juncture, a number of publick &s;pirited merchants of the city of London, and others, formed them&s;elves in a very laudable a&s;&s;ociation, under the name of the Marine Society, and contributed con&s;iderable &s;ums of mo|ney for equipping &s;uch orphans, friendle&s;s, and forlorn boys, as were wil|ling to engage in the &s;ervice of the navy. In con&s;equence of this excellent plan, which was executed with equal zeal and di&s;cretion, many thou&s;ands were re&s;cued from mi&s;ery, and rendered u&s;eful members of that &s;ociety, of which they mu&s;t have been the bane and the reproach, without this humane interpo&s;ition.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. About eighty &s;hips of the line and three&s;core
frigates were already equipped, and con&s;iderable bodies of
land forces a&s;&s;embled, when, on the third day of February,
a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, requiring all officers civil and
military, upon the fir&s;t appearance of any ho&s;tile attempt
to land upon the coa&s;ts of the kingdom, immediately to
cau&s;e all hor&s;es, oxen, or cattle, which might be fit for
draft or burthen, and not actually employed in the
king's &s;ervice, or in the defence of the country, and al&s;o (&s;o
far as might be practicable) all other cattle and provi&s;ions,
to be driven and removed twenty miles at lea&s;t from the
place where &s;uch ho&s;tile attempt &s;hould be made, and to
&s;ecure the &s;ame, &s;o as that they might not fall into the
hands or power of tho&s;e who &s;hould make &s;uch attempt;
regard being had, however, that the re&s;pective owners
&s;hould &s;uffer as little damage as might be con&s;i&s;tent with
the publick &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB N="478" REF="486">
&sect; XXVI. As the mini&s;try were determined to make their
chief efforts again&s;t the enemy in North-America, where
the fir&s;t ho&s;tilities had been committed, and where the
&s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion could be made, a detachment of two
regiments was &s;ent thither under the conduct of General
Abercrombie, appointed as &s;ucce&s;&s;or to General Shirley,
whom they had recalled, as a per&s;on no ways qualified to
conduct military operations: nor, indeed, could any &s;uc|ce&s;s
in war be expected from a man who had not been
trained to arms, nor ever acted but in a civil capacity.
But the command in chief of all the forces in America was
conferred upon the Earl of Loudoun, a nobleman of
amiable character, who had already di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf
in the &s;ervice of his country. Over and above this com|mand,
he was now appointed governor of Virginia, and
colonel of a royal American regiment, con&s;i&s;ting of four
battalions, to be rai&s;ed in that country, and di&s;ciplined
by officers of experience, invited from foreign &s;ervice. Mr.
Abercrombie &s;et &s;ail for America in March; but the Earl

May.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. All the&s;e previous mea&s;ures being taken, his
Maje&s;ty, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame month, thought proper
to publi&s;h a declaration of war<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">When the French amba&s;&s;ador returned to London, he propo&s;ed that or|ders &s;hould be immediately di&s;patched to the Engli&s;h governors in America, with expre&s;s orders to de&s;i&s;t from any new undertaking, and all acts of ho&s;|tility; but with regard to the lands on the Ohio, to put, without delay, matters on the &s;ame &s;ooting in which they &s;tood before the late war, that the re&s;pective claims of both nations might be amicably referred to the com|mi&s;&s;aries at Paris. The Briti&s;h court agreed to the ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, and the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the di&s;putes in the mini&s;ters of the two crowns, on condition that all the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in America &s;hould be previou&s;ly put in the &s;ituation pre&s;cribed by the treaty of Utrecht, confirmed by that of Aix-la-Chapelle. The French mini&s;try, in&s;tead of complying with this condition, produced an eva&s;ive draft of a preliminary convention, and this was an|&s;wered by a counter-propo&s;al; At length the amba&s;&s;ador of France demand|ed, as preliminary conditions, that Great-Britain would renounce all claim the &s;outh coa&s;t of the river St. Laurence, and the lakes that di&s;charge them|&s;elves into that river; cede to the French twenty leagues of country lying along the bay of Fundy, which divides Acadia, or Nova-Scotia; and all the land between the rivers Ohio and Ouabache. A memorial was afterwards pre&s;ented on the &s;ame &s;ubject, including the affair of the neutral i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies; but this was amply refuted in another piece, in which the Briti&s;h mini&s;try ob&s;erved, that even at the very opening of the commi&s;&s;i|on e&s;tabli&s;hed in Paris, for terminating amicably the di&s;putes in North-Ame|rica, the French invaded Nova-Scotia, erected three forts in the heart of that province, and would have de&s;troyed the Engli&s;h &s;ettlement at Halifax, had they not been prevented: That the like ho&s;tilities were committed up|on his Britannick Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects on the Ohio and Indian lakes, where the governors appointed by the French King, without any &s;hadow of right, prohibited the Engli&s;h from trading; &s;ei&s;ed their traders by force, and &s;ent them pri&s;oners to France; invaded the territories of Virginia, attacked a fort that covered its frontier, and, to &s;ecure their u&s;urpations, erected, with an armed force, a chain of forts on the lands which they had invaded. That his Britannick Maje&s;ty had complained of the&s;e ho&s;tilities to the court of Ver&s;ailles, but without effect; &s;o that he found him&s;elf obliged to provide for the &s;ecurity of his &s;ubjects; and as the encroachments made by France were ho&s;tile, it could never be unlawful, or irreconcileable with the a&s;&s;u|rance of his Maje&s;ty's peaceable di&s;po&s;ition, to repel an aggre&s;&s;or; and that the &s;ame motive of &s;elf defence had forced him to &s;ei&s;e the French &s;hips and &s;ailors, in order to deprive that court of the means of making an inva&s;ion, with which their mini&s;ters in all the courts of Europe had menaced England.</NOTE> again&s;t the French King,
<PB N="479" REF="487">
importing, that, &s;ince the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the
u&s;urpations and encroachments made upon the Briti&s;h ter|ritories
in America had been notorious: That his Britan|nick
Maje&s;ty had, in divers &s;erious repre&s;entations to the
court of Ver&s;ailles, complained of the&s;e repeated acts of
violence, and demanded &s;atisfaction; but notwith&s;tanding
the repeated a&s;&s;urances given by the French King, that
every thing &s;hould be &s;ettled agreeably to the treaties &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting
between the two crowns, and particularly that the
evacuation of the four neutral i&s;lands in the We&s;t-Indies
&s;hould be effected, the execution of the&s;e a&s;&s;urances, and
of the treaties on which they were founded, had been
evaded under the mo&s;t frivolous pretences: That the un|ju&s;tifiable
practice of the French governors, and officers
acting under their authority, were &s;till continued, until
they broke out in open acts of ho&s;tility in the year one
thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-four; when in time of
profound peace, without any declaration of war, without
any previous notice given, or application made, a body of
<PB N="480" REF="488">
French troops, commanded by an officer bearing the
French King's commi&s;&s;ion, attacked in an ho&s;tile manner,
and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, an Engli&s;h fort on the river Ohio
in North-America: That great naval armaments were
prepared in the ports of France, and a con&s;iderable body
of French troops embarked for that country: That al|though
the French amba&s;&s;ador was &s;ent back to England,
with &s;pecious profe&s;&s;ions of a de&s;ire to accommodate the&s;e
differences, it appeared their real de&s;ign was only to
amu&s;e, and gain time for the pa&s;&s;age of the&s;e &s;upplies and
re-enforcements, which they hoped would &s;ecure the &s;u|periority
of the French forces in America, and enable
them to carry their ambitious and oppre&s;&s;ive projects into
execution: That, in con&s;equence of the ju&s;t and nece&s;|&s;ary
mea&s;ures taken by the King of Great-Britain for
preventing the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch a dangerous de&s;ign, the
French amba&s;&s;ador was immediately recalled from Eng|land,
the fortifications of Dunkirk were enlarged, great
bodies of troops marched down to the &s;ea-coa&s;ts of France,
and the Briti&s;h dominions threatened with an inva&s;ion:
That though the King of England, in order to fru&s;trate
the&s;e intentions, had given orders for &s;ei&s;ing at &s;ea the &s;hips
of the French King and his &s;ubjects, yet he had hitherto
contented him&s;elf with detaining tho&s;e &s;hips which had
been taken, and pre&s;erving their cargoes entire, without
proceeding to confi&s;cation; but it being at la&s;t evident,
from the ho&s;tile inva&s;ion of Minorca, that the court of
Ver&s;ailles was determined to reject all propo&s;als of accom|modation,
and carry on the war with the utmo&s;t violence,
his Britannick Maje&s;ty could no longer, con&s;i&s;tently with
the honour of his crown, and the welfare of his &s;ubjects,
remain within tho&s;e bounds, which, from a de&s;ire of peace,
he had hitherto ob&s;erved. A denunciation of war followed
in the u&s;ual form, and was concluded with an a&s;&s;urance,
that all the French &s;ubjects re&s;iding in Great-Britain and
Ireland, who &s;hould demean them&s;elves dutifully to the go|vernment,
might depend upon its protection, and be &s;afe
in their per&s;ons and effects.</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="489">
&sect; XXVIII. In the beginning of June the French King
declared war in his turn again&s;t his Britannick Maje&s;ty,
and his declaration was couched in terms of uncommon
a&s;perity. He artfully threw a &s;hade over the beginning of
ho&s;tilities in North-America, referring to a memorial which
had been delivered to the &s;everal courts of Europe, con|taining
a &s;ummary of tho&s;e facts which related to the pre|&s;ent
war, and the negociations by which it had been pre|ceded.
He in&s;i&s;ted on the attack made by the King of Eng|land,
in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-four,
on the French po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in North-America; and
afterwards by the Engli&s;h navy on the navigation and com|merce
of the French &s;ubjects, in contempt of the law of
nations, and direct violation of treaties. He complained
that the French &s;oldiers and &s;ailors underwent the har&s;h|e&s;t
treatment in the Briti&s;h i&s;les, exceeding tho&s;e bounds
which are pre&s;cribed to the mo&s;t rigorous rights of war,
by the law of nature, and common humanity. He af|firmed,
that while the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, under the appear|ance
of &s;incerity, impo&s;ed upon the French amba&s;&s;ador
with fal&s;e prote&s;tations, orders diametrically oppo&s;ite to
the&s;e deceitful a&s;&s;urances of a &s;peedy accommodation were
actually carrying into execution in North-America: That
while the court of London employed every caballing art, and
&s;quandred away the &s;ub&s;idies of England, to in&s;tigate other
powers again&s;t France, his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty did not
even a&s;k of the&s;e powers the &s;uccours which guarantees and
defen&s;ive treaties authori&s;ed him to demand: but recom|mended
to them &s;uch mea&s;ures only as tended to their own
peace and &s;ecurity: That while the Engli&s;h navy, by the
mo&s;t odious violences, and &s;ometimes by the vile&s;t artifices,
made captures of French ve&s;&s;els, navigating in full &s;ecu|rity
under the &s;afeguard of publick faith, in mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
Maje&s;ty relea&s;ed an Engli&s;h frigate taken by a French
&s;quadron, and Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els traded to the ports of
France without mole&s;tation: That the &s;triking contra&s;t
formed by the&s;e different methods of proceeding would
convince all Europe, that one court was guided by mo|tives

<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">

<PB N="482" REF="492">
of jealou&s;y, ambition, and avarice: and that the con|duct
of the other was founded on principles of honour,
ju&s;tice, and moderation: That the vague imputations con|tained
in the King of England's declaration, had in reality
no foundation; and the very manner in which they were &s;et
forth would prove their futility and fal&s;ehood: That the
mention made of the works at Dunkirk, and the troops
a&s;&s;embled on the coa&s;ts of the ocean, implied the mo&s;t gro&s;s
attempt to deceive mankind into a belief, that the&s;e were
the points which determined the King of England to i&s;&s;ue
orders for &s;ei&s;ing the French ve&s;&s;els; whereas, the works at
Dunkirk were not begun till after two French &s;hips of war
had been taken by an Engli&s;h &s;quadron; and depredations
had been committed &s;ix months upon the &s;ubjects of France
before the fir&s;t battalions began their march for the &s;ea-&s;ide.
In a word, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, laying a&s;ide
that politene&s;s and decorum on which his people value
them&s;elves above all the nations upon the face of the
earth, very roundly taxes his brother monarch's admini&s;tra|tion
with piracy, perfidy, inhumanity, and deceit. A
charge conveyed in &s;uch reproachful terms, again&s;t one of
the mo&s;t re&s;pectable crowned heads in Europe, will appear
the more extraordinary and injurious, if we con&s;ider that
the accu&s;ers were well acquainted with the fal&s;ity of their
own imputations; and at the &s;ame time con&s;cious of having
practi&s;ed tho&s;e very arts which they affected &s;o much to
to decry. For, after all, it mu&s;t be allowed, that no|thing
could be ju&s;tly urged again&s;t the Engli&s;h government,
with re&s;pect to France, except the omi&s;&s;ion of a mere form,
which other nations might interpret into an irregularity,
but could not con&s;true into perfidious dealing, as the
French had previou&s;ly violated the peace by their in&s;olence
and encroachments.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. Whatever might have been the opinion of other
nations, certain it is, the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain heartily
approved of the ho&s;tilities committed and intended again&s;t
a people, whom they have always con&s;idered as their natu|ral
enemies, and the incendiaries of Europe. They chear|fully
<PB N="483" REF="493">
contributed to the expen&s;e of armaments<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Immediately after the declaration of war, the French &s;hips and cargoes which had been taken were tried, and condemned as legal prizes, expo&s;ed to publick &s;ale, and their produce lodged in the Bank; but in what manner this money, amounting to a large &s;um, was di&s;tributed or employed, we have not been able to di&s;cover.</NOTE>, and
&s;eemed to approve of their de&s;tination, in hopes of being
able to wipe off the di&s;graces they had &s;u&s;tained in the de|feat
of Braddock, and the lo&s;s of Minorca. The la&s;t
event made a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon the minds of the com|munity.
An addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to the King by the
lord-mayor, aldermen, and common-council of Lon|don,
containing &s;trong hints to the di&s;advantage of the mi|ni&s;try.
They expre&s;&s;ed their apprehen&s;ion, that the lo&s;s
of the important fortre&s;s of St. Philip and i&s;land of Minorca,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the commerce and
naval &s;trength of Great-Britain, without any attempt by
timely and effectual &s;uccours to prevent or defeat an attack,
after &s;uch early notice of the enemy's intentions, and
when his Maje&s;ty's navy was &s;o evidently &s;uperior to
their's, would be an indelible reproach on the honour of
the Briti&s;h nation. They expatiated upon the imminent
danger to which the Briti&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in America were
expo&s;ed, by the mi&s;management and delays which had at|tended
the defence of tho&s;e invaluable colonies, the object
of the pre&s;ent war, the principal &s;ource of the wealth and
&s;trength of the&s;e kingdoms. They lamented the want
of a con&s;titutional well-regulated militia, the mo&s;t natural
and certain defence again&s;t all invaders what&s;oever. They
&s;ignified their hope, that the authors of the late lo&s;&s;es and
di&s;appointments would be detected, and brought to condign
puni&s;hment; that his Maje&s;ty's known intentions of pro|tecting
and defending his &s;ubjects in their rights and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions
might be faithfully and vigorou&s;ly carried into
execution; and the large &s;upplies, &s;o nece&s;&s;arily demand|ed,
and &s;o chearfully granted, might be religiou&s;ly applied
to the defence of the&s;e kingdoms, their colonies, and their
commerce, as well as to the annoyance of their inveterate
and perfidious enemies, the only &s;ure means of obtaining
<PB N="484" REF="494">
a la&s;ting and honourable peace. In an&s;wer to this addre&s;s
the King a&s;&s;ured them, that he would not fail to do ju&s;tice
upon any per&s;ons who &s;hould have been wanting in their
duty to him and their country; to enforce obedience and
di&s;cipline in his fleets and armies; and to &s;upport the
authority and re&s;pect due to his government. Remon|&s;trances
of the &s;ame kind were pre&s;ented by different coun|ties
and corporations; and the populace clamoured aloud
for enquiry and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The fir&s;t victim offered to the enraged multi|tude

deputy-governor of Gibraltar, and behaved with remark|able
conduct and integrity in the exerci&s;e of that impor|tant
office, till that period, when he fell under the di&s;plea|&s;ure

I have al&s;o his royal high|ne&s;s the Duke of Cumberland's commands, to de&s;ire that you will keep your garri&s;on as alert as po&s;&s;ible, during this critical time, and give &s;uch other a&s;&s;i&s;tance as may be in your power for the relief of Minorca; taking care, however, not to fatigue or endanger your own garri&s;on.</P>
</LETTER></NOTE>, touching the relief of Mi|norca.
<PB N="485" REF="495">
Mr. F&mdash;ke alledged in his own defence, that
the orders were confu&s;ed and contradictory, and implied a
di&s;cretionary power: that the whole number of his garri&s;on
did not exceed two thou&s;and &s;ix hundred men, after he
had &s;pared two hundred and &s;eventy-five to the &s;hips com|manded
by Mr. Edgecumbe: that the ordinary duty of
the garri&s;on requiring eight hundred men, the whole num|ber
was not &s;ufficient for three reliefs: that, if he had de|tached
a battalion on board the fleet, he &s;hould not have
had above two reliefs, at a time when he believed the place
was in danger of being attacked, for good rea&s;ons, which
he did not think him&s;elf at liberty to mention: that his
orders being doubtful, he held a council of war, which
was of opinion, that as undoubted intelligence was re|ceived
of the French army's being landed at Minorca, to
the number of between thirteen and &s;ixteen thou&s;and men,
and that a French &s;quadron of &s;ixteen &s;hips was &s;tationed
off the harbour, the &s;ending a detachment equal to a bat|talion
from Gibraltar would be an ineffectual &s;upply for
the relief of the place, and a weakening of the garri&s;on
<PB N="486" REF="496">
from which they mu&s;t be &s;ent. He ob&s;erved, that &s;uppo&s;ing
the orders to have been po&s;itive, and &s;even hundred men
detached to Minorca, the number remaining at Gib|raltar
would not have exceeded one thou&s;and five hundred
and fifty-&s;ix: a deduction of &s;even hundred more, according
to the order of May the twelfth, would have left a remain|der
of eight hundred and fifty-&s;ix: that the men daily on
duty in the garri&s;on, including artificers and labourers in
the King's works, amounted to eight hundred and thirty-nine;
&s;o that if he had complied with the orders as they
arrived, he would not have had more than &s;eventeen men
over and above the number nece&s;&s;ary for the daily work of
the garri&s;on: thus, the important fortre&s;s of Gibraltar mu&s;t,
at this critical conjuncture, have been left almo&s;t naked
and defencele&s;s to the attempts of the enemy: and had
tho&s;e detachments been actually &s;ent aboard, it afterwards
appeared that they could not have been landed on the i&s;land
of Minorca. The order tran&s;mitted to General F&mdash;ke
to detain all empty ve&s;&s;els, for a further tran&s;portation of
troops, &s;eems to have been &s;uperfluous; for it can hardly
be &s;uppo&s;ed he could have occa&s;ion for them, unle&s;s to
embark the whole garri&s;on, and abandon the place. It
&s;eems likewi&s;e to have been unnece&s;&s;ary to exhort the ge|neral
to keep his garri&s;on as alert as po&s;&s;ible, during that
critical time; ina&s;much as it would have been impo&s;&s;ible
for the men to have enjoyed the lea&s;t repo&s;e or intermi&s;&s;ion
of duty, had the orders been punctually and literally
obeyed. What other a&s;&s;i&s;tance it might have been in the
governor's power to give for the relief of Minorca, or in
what manner he could avoid fatiguing his garri&s;on, while
there was an impo&s;&s;ibility of relieving the guards, it is not
ea&s;y to comprehend. Be that as it may, when the trial
was fini&s;hed, and the que&s;tion put to acquit or &s;u&s;pend for
one year, the court was equally divided; and in &s;uch
ca&s;es the ca&s;ting vote being ve&s;ted in the pre&s;ident, he
threw it into the &s;cale again&s;t the pri&s;oner, whom his Ma|je&s;ty
thought fit to di&s;mi&s;s from his &s;ervice.</P>

&sect; XXXI. The expectation of the publick was now
eagerly turned towards America, the chief if not
the &s;ole &s;cene of our military operations. On the twenty-fifth
day of June, Mr. Abercrombie arrived at Albany, the
frontier of New-York, and a&s;&s;umed the command of the
forces there a&s;&s;embled, con&s;i&s;ting of two regiments which
had &s;erved under Braddock, two battalions rai&s;ed in Ame|rica,
two regiments now tran&s;ported from England, four
independent companies which had been many years main|tained
in New-York, the New-Jer&s;ey regiment, four com|panies
levied in North-Carolina, and a body of provincial
forces rai&s;ed by the government of New-England. Tho&s;e
to the &s;outhward, including Penn&s;ylvania, Maryland,
and Virgina, had not yet determined on any regular plan
of operation, and were moreover hard pre&s;&s;ed in defending
their we&s;tern frontier from the French and Indians, who, in
&s;kulking parties, made &s;udden irruptions upon their un|guarded
&s;ettlements, burning, plundering, and ma&s;&s;acring
with the mo&s;t &s;avage inhumanity. As for South-Carolina,
the proportion of negro-&s;laves to the number of white in|habitants
was &s;o great in that colony, that the government
could not, with any regard to the &s;afety of the province,
&s;pare any re-enforcement for the general enterpri&s;e. The
plan of this undertaking had been &s;ettled the preceding year
in a council of war held at New-York. There it was re&s;olv|ed
to attack the fort of Niagara, &s;ituated between the lakes
Ontario and Erie, in order to cut off the communication
between Canada, and Loui&s;iana, and prevent the French
from &s;upporting their new fortre&s;&s;es on the Ohio; to reduce
Ticonderago and Crown-Point, &s;o that the frontier of New-York
might be delivered from the danger of an inva&s;ion,
and Great-Britain become ma&s;ter of the lake Champlain,
over which the forces might be tran&s;ported in any future
attempt: to be&s;iege Fort Du Que&s;ne upon the Ohio; and
to detach a body of troops by the river Kennebec, to alarm
the capital of Canada. This plan was too exten&s;ive for
the number of troops which had been prepared: the &s;ea&s;on
was too far advanced before the regiments arrived from
<PB N="488" REF="498">
England, the different colonies were divided in their
opinions, and Mr. Abercrombie po&s;tponed the execution
of any important &s;cheme till the arrival of Lord Loudoun,
who was daily expected. The rea&s;ons that delayed the
re-enforcement, and detained his lord&s;hip &s;o long, we do
not pretend to explain; though we may be allowed to
ob&s;erve, that many fair opportunities have been lo&s;t, by the
neglect and procra&s;tination of an Engli&s;h mini&s;try. Cer|tain
it is, the unaccountable delay of this armament ren|dered
it u&s;ele&s;s for a whole year, afforded time and lei&s;ure
to the enemy to take their precautions again&s;t any &s;ub&s;e|quent
attack, and, in the mean time, to proceed unmole&s;ted
in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements. Even before this
period, they had attacked and reduced a &s;mall po&s;t in the
country of the Five Nations, occupied by twenty five Eng|li&s;hmen,
who were cruelly butchered to a man, in the
mid&s;t of tho&s;e Indians whom Great-Britain had long
numbered among her allies.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. Soon after this expedition, having received
intelligence that a con&s;iderable convoy of provi&s;ions and
&s;tores, for the garri&s;on of O&s;wego, would in a little time
&s;et out from Schenectady, and be conveyed in batteaux up
the river Onondaga, they formed an ambu&s;cade among
the woods and thickets on the north &s;ide of that river; but
under&s;tanding the convoy had pa&s;&s;ed before they reached
the place, they re&s;olved to wait the return of the detach|ment.
Their de&s;ign, however, was fru&s;trated by the vigi|lance
and valour of Colonel Brad&s;treet, who expected
&s;uch an attempt, and had taken his mea&s;ures accordingly.
On the third day of July, while he &s;temmed the &s;tream of
the river, with his batteaux formed into three divi&s;ions,
they were &s;aluted with the Indian war-whoop, and a
general di&s;charge of mu&s;quetry from the north &s;hore.
Brad&s;treet immediately ordered his men to land on the
oppo&s;ite bank, and with a few of the foremo&s;t took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of a &s;mall i&s;land, where he was forthwith attacked
by a party of the enemy, who had forded the river for that
purpo&s;e; but the&s;e were &s;oon repul&s;ed. Another body
<PB N="489" REF="499">
having pa&s;&s;ed a mile higher, he advanced to them at the
head of two hundred men, and fell upon them, &s;word in
hand, with &s;uch vigour, that many were killed on the &s;pot,
and the re&s;t driven into the river with &s;uch precipitation,
that a con&s;iderable number of them were drowned. Having
received information that a third body of them had pa&s;&s;ed
at a ford &s;till higher, he marched thither without he&s;itation,
and pur&s;ued them to the other &s;ide, where they were en|tirely
routed and di&s;per&s;ed. In this action, which la&s;ted
near three hours, about &s;eventy of the batteau-men were
killed or wounded: but the enemy lo&s;t double the number
killed, and above &s;eventy taken pri&s;oners. In all proba|bility
the whole detachment of French, amounting to
&s;even hundred men, would have been cut off, had not a
heavy rain interpo&s;ed, and di&s;abled Colonel Brad&s;treet
from following his blow; for that &s;ame night he was
joined by Captain Patten, with his grenadiers, in
his march from Oneida to O&s;wego, and next morning re-enforced
with two hundred men, detached to his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
from the garri&s;on of O&s;wego, but by this time the
rivulets were &s;o &s;welled by the rain, that it was found im|practible
to pur&s;ue the enemy through the woods and
thickets. Patten and his grenadiers accompanied the de|tachment
to O&s;wego, while Brad&s;treet pur&s;ued his voyage
to Schenectady, from whence he repaired to Albany, and
communicated to General Abercrombie the intelligence
he had received from the pri&s;oners, that a large body of the
enemy were encamped on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the lake On|tario,
provided with artillery, and all other implements, to
be&s;iege the fort of O&s;wego.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. In con&s;equence of this information, Major-General
Webb was ordered to hold him&s;elf in readine&s;s to
march with one regiment to the relief of that garri&s;on;
but, before they could be provided with nece&s;&s;aries, the
Earl of Loudoun arrived at the head-quarters at Albany, on
the twenty-ninth day of July. The army at this time is
&s;aid to have con&s;i&s;ted of regular troops to the number of
two thou&s;and &s;ix hundred, about &s;even thou&s;and provin|cials,
&s;uppo&s;ed to be in readine&s;s to march from Fort
<PB N="490" REF="500">
William-Henry, under the command of General Win&s;low,
over and above a con&s;iderable number of batteau men at
Albany and Schenectady. The garri&s;on at O&s;wego amount|ed
to fourteen hundred &s;oldiers, be&s;ides three hundred
workmen and &s;ailors, either in the fort, or po&s;ted in &s;mall
parties between the fort and a place called Burnet's field,
to &s;ecure a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age through the country of the Six
Nations, upon who&s;e friend&s;hip there was no longer any
reliance. By the be&s;t accounts received of the enemy's
force, they had about three thou&s;and men at Crown-Point
and Ticonderago upon the lake Champlain: but their
chief &s;trength was collected upon the banks of the lake
Ontario, where their purpo&s;e undoubtedly was to reduce
the Engli&s;h fort at O&s;wego. The immediate object,
therefore, of Lord Loudoun's attention was the relief of
this place; but his de&s;ign was &s;trenou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the
province of New-York, and other northern governments,
who were much more intent upon the reduction of Crown-Point,
and the &s;ecurity of their own frontiers, which they
apprehended was connected with this conque&s;t. They
in&s;i&s;ted upon Win&s;low's being joined by &s;ome regiments
of regular troops before he &s;hould march again&s;t this for|tre&s;s;
and &s;tipulated that a body of re&s;erve &s;hould be de|tained
at Albany, for the defence of that frontier, in ca&s;e
Win&s;low &s;hould fail in his enterpri&s;e and be defeated. At
length they agreed, that the regiment which Mr. Aber|crombie
had de&s;tined for that purpo&s;e &s;hould be detached
to the relief of O&s;wego; and on the twelfth day of Au|gu&s;t
Major-General Webb began his march with it from
Albany: but on his arrival at the Carrying-place, between
the Mohock's river and Wood's-creek, he received the
di&s;agreeable new that O&s;wego was taken, and the gar|ri&s;on
made pri&s;oners of war. Mr. Webb, apprehending
him&s;elf in danger of being attacked by the be&s;ieging army,
began immediately to render the creek impa&s;&s;able, even to
canoes, by felling trees, and throwing them into the
&s;tream; while the enemy, ignorant of his numbers, and
apprehen&s;ive of a like vi&s;itation from him, took the very
<PB N="491" REF="501">
&s;ame method of preventing his approach: in con&s;equence
of this apprehen&s;ion, he was permitted to retire unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. The lo&s;s of the two &s;mall forts, called On|tario
and O&s;wego, was a con&s;iderable national misfortune.
They were erected on the &s;outh &s;ide of the great lake On|tario,
&s;tanding on oppo&s;ite &s;ides, at the mouth of the
Onondago river, that di&s;charges it&s;elf into the lake, and
con&s;tituted a po&s;t of great importance, where ve&s;&s;els had
been built, to crui&s;e upon the lake, which is a kind of inland
&s;ea, and interrupt the commerce as well as the motions
and de&s;igns of the enemy. The garri&s;on, as we have
already ob&s;erved, con&s;i&s;ted of fourteen hundred men,
chiefly militia and new-rai&s;ed recruits, under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel Mercer, an officer of courage and
experience: but the &s;ituation of the forts was very ill
cho&s;en; the materials mo&s;tly timber, or logs of wood; the
defences wretchedly contrived, and unfini&s;hed; and, in a
word, the place altogether untenable again&s;t any regular
approach. Such were the forts which the enemy wi&s;ely
re&s;olved to reduce. Being under no apprehen&s;ion for
Crown-Point, they a&s;&s;embled a body of troops, con&s;i&s;ting
of thirteen hundred regulars, &s;eventeen hundred Canadians,
and a con&s;iderable number of Indian auxiliaries, under the
command of the Marquis de Montcalm, a vigilant and
enterpri&s;ing officer, to whom the conduct of the &s;iege was
entru&s;ted by the Marquis de Vaudreuil, governor and
lieutenant-general of New France. The fir&s;t &s;tep taken
by Montcalm was to block up O&s;wego by water with two
large armed ve&s;&s;els, and po&s;t a &s;trong body of Canadians
on the road between Albany and the forts, to cut off all
communication of &s;uccour and intelligence. In the mean
time, he embarked his artillery and &s;tores upon the lake,
and landed them in the bay of Nixouri, the place of
general rendezvous. At another creek, within half a
league of O&s;wego, he erected a battery for the protection
of his ve&s;&s;els, and on the twelfth day of Augu&s;t, at mid|night,
after his di&s;po&s;itions had been made, he opened the
trenches before Fort-Ontario. The garri&s;on having fired
<PB N="492" REF="502">
away all their &s;hells and ammunition, &s;piked up the can|non,
and de&s;erting the fort, retired next day acro&s;s the
river into O&s;wego, which was even more expo&s;ed than the
other, e&s;pecially when the enemy had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Ontario, from whence they immediately began to fire
without intermi&s;&s;ion. Colonel Mercer being, on the thir|teenth,
killed by a cannon-ball, the fort de&s;titute of all
cover, the officers divided in opinion, and the garri&s;on in
confu&s;ion, they next day demanded a capitulation, and
&s;urrendered pri&s;oners of war, on condition that they &s;hould
be exempted from plunder, conducted to Montreal, and
treated with humanity. The&s;e conditions, however, the
Marquis did not punctually ob&s;erve. The Briti&s;h officers
and &s;oldiers were in&s;ulted by the &s;avage Indians, who rob|bed
them of their clothes and baggage, ma&s;&s;acred &s;everal
men as they &s;tood defencele&s;s on the parade, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated
Lieutenant De la Court as he lay wounded in his tent,
under the protection of a French officer, and barbarou&s;ly
&s;calped all the &s;ick people in the ho&s;pital: finally, Mont|calm,
in direct violation of the articles, as well as in con|tempt
of common humanity, delivered up above twenty
men of the garri&s;on to the Indians, in lieu of the &s;ame
number they had lo&s;t during the &s;iege: and, in all pro|bability,
the&s;e mi&s;erable captives were put to death by tho&s;e
barbarians with the mo&s;t excruciating tortures, according
to the execrable cu&s;tom of the country. Tho&s;e who
countenance the perpetration of cruelties, at which human
nature &s;hudders with horrour, ought to be branded as infa|mous
to all po&s;terity. Such, however, were the trophies
that, in the cour&s;e of the American war, di&s;tingui&s;hed the
operations of a people who pique them&s;elves upon polite|ne&s;s,
and the virtues of humanity. The pri&s;oners taken
at O&s;wego, after having been thus barbarou&s;ly treated, were
conveyed in batteaux to Montreal, where they had no
rea&s;on to complain of their reception; and, before the
end of the year, they were exchanged. The victors im|mediately
demoli&s;hed the two forts (if they de&s;erved that
denomination) in which they found one hundred and
<PB N="493" REF="503">
twenty-one pieces of artillery, fourteen mortars, with a
great quantity of ammunition, warlike &s;tores, and pro|vi&s;ion,
be&s;ides two &s;loops, and two hundred batteaux, which
likewi&s;e fell into their hands. Such an important maga|zine,
depo&s;ited in a place altogether indefen&s;ible, and
without the reach of immediate &s;uccour, was a flagrant
proof of egregious folly, temerity, and mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. The Earl of Loudoun, finding the &s;ea&s;on
too far advanced to admit of any enterpri&s;e again&s;t the
enemy, exerted all his endeavours in making preparations
for an early campaign in the &s;pring, in &s;ecuring the fron|tiers
of the Engli&s;h colonies, in forming an uniform plan
of action, and promoting a &s;pirit of harmony among the
different governments, which had been long divided by
jarring intere&s;ts, and other &s;ources of di&s;&s;ention. Mean
while, the forts Edward and William-Henry were put in a
proper po&s;ture of defence, and &s;ecured with numerous
garri&s;ons; and the forces put into winter-quarters at Al|bany,
where comfortable barracks were built for that pur|po&s;e.
Fort-Granville, on the confines of Penn&s;ylvania, an
incon&s;iderable blockhou&s;e, was &s;urpri&s;ed by a party of
French and Indians, who made the garri&s;on pri&s;oners, con|&s;i&s;ting
of two-and-twenty &s;oldiers, with a few women and
children. The&s;e they loaded with flour and provi&s;ion,
and drove into captivity; but the fort they reduced to
a&s;hes. Many &s;hocking murthers were perpetrated upon
defencele&s;s people, without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex, in
different parts of the frontiers: but the&s;e outrages were
in &s;ome mea&s;ure balanced by the advantages re&s;ulting
from a treaty of peace, which the governor of Penn&s;ylva|nia
concluded with the Delaware Indians, a powerful
tribe that dwell upon the river Sa&s;quehanna, forming, as
it were, a line along the &s;outhern &s;kirts of the province.
At the &s;ame time the governor of Virginia &s;ecured the friend|&s;hip
and alliance of the Cherokees and Catawbas, two pow|erful
nations adjoining to that colony, who were able to bring
three thou&s;and fighting men into the field. All the&s;e
circum&s;tances con&s;idered, Great-Britain had rea&s;on to
<PB N="494" REF="504">
expect that the en&s;uing campaign would be vigorou&s;ly
pro&s;ecuted in America, e&s;pecially as a fre&s;h re-enforcement
of troops, with a great &s;upply of warlike &s;tores was &s;ent
to that country in fourteen tran&s;ports, under convoy of
two &s;hips of war, which &s;ailed from Cork, in Ireland,
about the beginning of November.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. No action of great importance di&s;tingui&s;hed
the naval tran&s;actions of this year on the &s;ide of America.
In the beginning of June, Captain Spry, who commanded
a &s;mall &s;quadron, crui&s;ing off Loui&s;bourg, in the i&s;land of
Cape-Breton, took the Arc en Ciel, a French &s;hip of
fifty-guns, having on board near &s;ix hundred men, with
a large quantity of &s;tores and provi&s;ions for the garri&s;on.
He likewi&s;e made prize of another French &s;hip, with &s;even|ty
&s;oldiers, two hundred barrels of powder, two large bra&s;s
mortars, and other &s;tores of the like de&s;tination. On the
twenty-&s;eventh day of July Commodore Holmes, being in
the &s;ame latitude, with two large &s;hips and a couple of
&s;loops, engaged two French &s;hips of the line and four fri|gates,
and obliged them to &s;heer off, after an ob&s;tinate di&s;|pute.
A great number of privateers were equipped in this
country, as well as in the We&s;t-India i&s;lands belonging to
the crown of Great-Britain; and as tho&s;e &s;eas &s;warmed
with French ve&s;&s;els, their crui&s;es proved very advantage|ous
to the adventurers.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. Scenes of higher import were this year acted
by the Briti&s;h arms in the Ea&s;t-Indies. The ce&s;&s;ation of
ho&s;tilities between the Engli&s;h and French companies on
the penin&s;ula of Indus, though it encouraged Mr. Clive to
vi&s;it his native country, was not of long duration; for in
a few months both &s;ides recommenced their operations, no
longer as auxiliaries to the princes of the country, but as
principals and rivals, both in arms and commerce. Major
Laurence, who now enjoyed the chief command of the
Engli&s;h forces, obtained divers advantages over the enemy;
and pro&s;ecuted his &s;ucce&s;s with &s;uch vigour, as, in all
probability, would in a little time have terminated the
war according to his own wi&s;h, when the progre&s;s of his
<PB N="495" REF="505">
arms was interrupted and &s;u&s;pended by an unfortunate
event at Calcutta, the cau&s;e of which is not ea&s;ily ex|plained:
for extraordinary pains have been taken to throw
a veil over &s;ome tran&s;actions, from whence this calamity
was immediately or remotely derived.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The old Suba or viceroy of Bengal,
Bahar, and Orixa, dying in the month of April, in the
year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty-&s;ix, was &s;uc|ceeded
by his adopted &s;on, Sur Raja al Dowlat, a young
man of violent pa&s;&s;ions, without principle, fortitude, or
good faith, who began his admini&s;tration with acts of per|fidy
and violence. In all probability, his de&s;ign again&s;t
the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements was &s;ugge&s;ted by his rapacious di&s;|po&s;ition,
on a belief that they abounded with trea&s;ure; as
the pretences which he u&s;ed for commencing ho&s;tilities
were altogether incon&s;i&s;tent, fal&s;e, and frivolous. In the
month of May, he cau&s;ed the Engli&s;h factory at Ca&s;&s;im|buzar
to be inve&s;ted, and inviting Mr. Watts, the chief
of the factory, to a conference, under the &s;anction of a
&s;afe conduct, detained him as pri&s;oner; then, by means of
fraud and force intermingled, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the
factory. This exploit being atchieved, he made no &s;ecret of
his de&s;ign to deprive the Engli&s;h of all their &s;ettlements.
With this view he marched to Calcutta, at the head of a
numerous army, and inve&s;ted the place, which was then in
no po&s;ture of defence.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The governor, intimidated by the number
and power of the enemy, abandoned the fort, and with
&s;ome principal per&s;ons re&s;iding in the &s;ettlement, took
refuge on board a &s;hip in the river, carrying along with
them their mo&s;t valuable effects, and the books of the com|pany.
Thus the defence of the place devolved to Mr.
Holwell, the &s;econd in command, who with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of a few gallant officers, and a very feeble garri&s;on, main|teined
it with uncommon courage and re&s;olution again&s;t
&s;everal attacks, until he was overpowered by numbers, and
the enemy had forced their way into the ca&s;tle. Then he
was obliged to &s;ubmit; and the Suba, or viceroy, promi&s;ed
<PB N="496" REF="506">
on the word of a &s;oldier, that no injury &s;hould be done to
him or his garri&s;on. Neverthele&s;s, they were all driven,
to the number of one hundred and forty &s;ix per&s;ons of both
&s;exes, into a place called the Black-Hole pri&s;on, a cube of
about eighteen feet, walled up to the ea&s;tward and &s;outh|ward,
the only quarters from which they could expect the
lea&s;t refre&s;hing air, and open to the we&s;tward by two win|dows
&s;trongly barred with iron, through which there was
no perceptible circulation. The humane reader will
conceive with horrour the mi&s;erable &s;ituation to which they
mu&s;t have been reduced, when thus &s;tewed up in a clo&s;e
&s;ultry night under &s;uch a climate as that of Bengal, e&s;pe|cially
when he reflects that many of them were wounded,
and all of them fatigued with hard duty. Tran&s;ported
with rage to find them&s;elves thus barbarou&s;ly cooped up
in a place where they mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to &s;uffocation,
tho&s;e haple&s;s victims endeavoured to force open the door,
that they might ru&s;h upon the &s;words of the barbarians by
whom they were &s;urrounded: but all their efforts were
ineffectual; the door was made to open inwards, and being
once &s;hut upon them, the crowd pre&s;&s;ed upon it &s;o &s;trongly
as to render all their endeavours abortive: then they were
overwhelmed with di&s;traction and de&s;pair. Mr. Holwell,
who had placed him&s;elf at one of the windows, acco&s;ted a
Jemmautdaar, or &s;erjeant of the Indian guard, and having
endeavoured to excite his compa&s;&s;ion, by drawing a pa|thetick
picture of their &s;ufferings, promi&s;ed to gratify him
with a thou&s;and rupees in the morning, if he could find
means to remove one half of them into a &s;eparate apart|ment.
The &s;oldier, allured by the promi&s;e of &s;uch a re|ward,
a&s;&s;ured him he would do his endeavour for their
relief, and retired for that purpo&s;e, but in a few minutes
returned, and told him that the Suba, by who&s;e order alone
&s;uch a &s;tep could be taken, was a&s;leep, and no per&s;on
dur&s;t di&s;turb his repo&s;e. By this time a profu&s;e &s;weat had
broke out on every individual, and this was attended with
an in&s;atiable thir&s;t, which became the more intolerable as
the body was drained of its moi&s;ture. In vain tho&s;e
<PB N="497" REF="507">
mi&s;erable objects &s;tripped them&s;elves of their clothes,
&s;quatted down on their hams, and fanned the air with their
hats, to produce a refre&s;hing undulation. Many were una|ble
to to ri&s;e again from this po&s;ture, but falling down were
trod to death, or &s;uffocated. The dreadful &s;ymptom of
thir&s;t was now accompanied with a difficulty of re&s;piration,
and every individual ga&s;ped for breath. Their de&s;pair
became outrageous: again they attempted to force the
door, and provoke the guard to fire upon them by execra|tion
and abu&s;e. The cry of &startq;Water! Water!&endq; i&s;&s;ued
from every mouth. Even the Jemmautdaar was moved to
compa&s;&s;ion at their di&s;tre&s;s. He ordered his &s;oldiers to
bring &s;ome &s;kins of water, which &s;erved only to enrage the
appetite, and increa&s;e the general agitation. There was
no other way of conveying it through the windows but
by hats, and this was rendered ineffectual by the eagerne&s;s
and tran&s;ports of the wretched pri&s;oners, who at &s;ight of
it &s;truggled and raved even into fits of delirium. In con|&s;equence
of the&s;e conte&s;ts, very little reached tho&s;e who
&s;tood neare&s;t the windows, while the re&s;t, at the farther end
of the pri&s;on, were totally excluded from all relief, and
continued calling upon their friends for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and con|juring
them by all the tender ties of pity and affection.
To tho&s;e who were indulged, it proved pernicious; for,
in&s;tead of allaying their thir&s;t, it enraged their impatience
for more. The confu&s;ion became general and horrid;
all was clamour and conte&s;t; tho&s;e who were at a di&s;tance
endeavoured to force their pa&s;&s;age to the window, and the
weak were pre&s;&s;ed down to the ground, never to ri&s;e again.
The inhuman ruffians without derived entertainment
from their mi&s;ery: they &s;upplied the pri&s;oners with more
water, and held up lights clo&s;e to the bars, that they might
enjoy the inhuman plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them fight for the
baneful indulgence. Mr. Holwell, &s;eeing all his particu|lar
friends lying dead around him, and trampled upon by
the living, finding him&s;elf wedged up &s;o clo&s;e as to be de|prived
of all motion, begged, as the la&s;t in&s;tance of their
regard, that they would remove the pre&s;&s;ure, and allow
him to retire from the window, that he might die in
<PB N="498" REF="508">
quiet. Even in tho&s;e dreadful circum&s;tances, which might
be &s;uppo&s;ed to have levelled all di&s;tinction, the poor de|lirious
wretches manife&s;ted a re&s;pect for his rank and cha|racter:
they forthwith gave way, and he forced his pa&s;&s;age
into the centre of the place, which was not crowded &s;o
much, becau&s;e, by this time, about one third of the num|ber
had peri&s;hed, and lay in little compa&s;s on the floor,
while the re&s;t &s;till crowded to both windows. He retired
to a platform at the farther end of the room, and lying
down upon &s;ome of his dead friends, recommended his
&s;oul to heaven. Here his thir&s;t grew in&s;upportable; his
difficulty in breathing increa&s;ed, and he was &s;ei&s;ed with a
&s;trong palpitation. The&s;e violent &s;ymptoms, which he
could not bear, urged him to make another effort: he
forced his way back to the window, and cried aloud,
&startq;Water! for God's &s;ake!&endq; He had been &s;uppo&s;ed already
dead by his wretched companions, but finding him &s;till alive,
they exhibited another extraordinary proof of tenderne&s;s and
regard to his per&s;on: &startq;give him water,&endq; they cried; nor
would one of them attempt to touch it until he had drank.
He now breathed more freely, and the palpitation cea&s;ed:
but finding him&s;elf &s;till more thir&s;ty after drinking, he
ab&s;tained from water, and moi&s;tened his mouth from time
to time, by &s;ucking the per&s;piration from his &s;hirt &s;leeves<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In his de&s;pair of obtaining water, this unhappy gentleman had at|tempted to drink his own urine: but &s;ound it intolorably bitter; where|as the moi&s;ture that &s;lowed from the pores of his body was &s;oft, plea&s;ant, and refre&s;hing.</NOTE>.
The mi&s;erable pri&s;oners, perceiving that water rather ag|gravated
than relieved their di&s;tre&s;s, grew clamorous for
air, and repeated their in&s;ults to the guard, loading the
Suba and his governor with the mo&s;t virulent reproach.
From railing, they had recour&s;e to prayer, be&s;eeching
heaven to put an end to their mi&s;ery. They now began
to drop on all hands; but then a &s;team aro&s;e from the
living, and the dead, as pungent and volatile as &s;pirit of
hart&s;horn; &s;o that all who could not approach the win|dows
were &s;uffocated. Mr. Holwell being weary of life,
retired once more to the platform, and &s;tretched him&s;elf by
the Rev. Mr. Jervas Bellamy, who, together with his &s;on,
a lieutenant, lay dead in each others's embrace. In this
<PB N="499" REF="509">
&s;ituation he was &s;oon deprived of &s;en&s;e, and lay to all ap|pearance
dead till day broke, when his body was di&s;covered,
and removed by his &s;urviving friends to one of the win|dows,
where the fre&s;h air revived him, and he was re&s;tored
to his &s;ight and &s;en&s;es. The Suba, at la&s;t, being informed
that the greater part of the pri&s;oners were &s;uffocated, en|quired
if the chief was alive; and being an&s;wered in the
affirmative, &s;ent an order for their immediate relea&s;e, when
no more than twenty-three &s;urvived of an hundred and
forty-&s;ix who had entered alive.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. Nor was the late deliverance, even of the&s;e few,
owing to any &s;entiment of compa&s;&s;ion in the viceroy. He
had received information, that there was a con&s;iderable trea|&s;ure
&s;ecreted in the $ort, and that Mr. Holwell knew the
place where it was depo&s;ited. That gentleman, who,
with his &s;urviving companions, had been &s;ei&s;ed with a
putrid fever immediately upon their relea&s;e, was dragged
in that condition before the inhuman Suba, who que&s;tioned
him about the trea&s;ure, which exi&s;ted no where but in his
own imagination; and would give no credit to his pro|te&s;tations,
when he &s;olemnly declared he knew of no &s;uch
depo&s;it. Mr. Holwell and three of his friends were loaded
with fetters, and conveyed three miles to the Indian camp,
where they lay all night, expo&s;ed to a &s;evere rain: next
morning they were brought back to town, &s;till manacled,
under the &s;corching beams of a &s;un inten&s;ely hot; and
mu&s;t infallibly have expired, had not nature expelled the
fever in large painful boils, that covered almo&s;t the whole
body. In this piteous condition they were embarked in an
open boat for Muxadabad, the capital of Bengal, and im|derwent
&s;uch cruel treatment and mi&s;ery in their pa&s;&s;age,
as would &s;hock the humane reader, &s;hould he peru&s;e the
particulars. At Muxadabad they were led through the
city in chains, as a &s;pectacle to the inhabitants, lodged in
an open &s;table, and treated for &s;ome days as the wor&s;t of
criminals. At length the Suba's grandmother interpo&s;ed
her mediation in their behalf; and as that prince was by
this time convinced that there was no trea&s;ure concealed
<PB N="500" REF="510">
at Calcutta, he ordered them to be &s;et at liberty. When
&s;ome of his &s;ycophants oppo&s;ed this indulgence, repre|&s;enting
that Mr. Holwell had &s;till enough left to pay a
con&s;iderable ran&s;om, he replied with &s;ome marks of com|punction
and genero&s;ity, &startq;If he has any thing left, let
him keep it; his &s;ufferings have been great: he &s;hall
have his liberty.&endq; Mr. Holwell and his friends were
no &s;ooner unfettered, than they took water for the Dutch
Tankfall or mint, in the neighbourhood of the city,
where they were received with great tenderne&s;s and hu|manity.
The reader, we hope, will excu&s;e us for having
thus particulari&s;ed a tran&s;action &s;o intere&s;ting and extra|ordinary
in all its circum&s;tances. The Suba having de|&s;troyed
Calcutta, and di&s;per&s;ed the inhabitants, extorted
large &s;ums from the French and Dutch factories, that he
might di&s;play a &s;pirit of impartiality again&s;t all the Euro|peans,
even in his oppre&s;&s;ion, and returned to his city of
Muxadabad in triumph. By the reduction of Calcutta,
the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India company's affairs were &s;o much
embroiled in that part of the world, that perhaps nothing
could have retrieved them but the interpo&s;ition of a nation|al
force, and the good fortune of a Clive, who&s;e enter|pri&s;es
were always crowned with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. As the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India company had, for a
whole century, been at a con&s;iderable expen&s;e in maintain|ing
a marine force at Bombay, to protect their &s;hips from
the piracies of the Angrias, who had rendered them&s;elves
independent princes, and fortified Geriah in that neigh|bourhood;
many un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts had been made to
de&s;troy their naval power, and reduce the fortre&s;s, under
which they always took &s;helter. In the year one thou&s;and
&s;even hundred and fifty-four, the fleet of Tullagee Angria,
the reigning prince, attacked three Dutch &s;hips of force,
which they either took or de&s;troyed. Elated with this
&s;ucce&s;s, he boa&s;ted that he &s;hould in a little time &s;weep
the &s;eas of the Europeans, and began to build &s;ome large
&s;hips, to re-enforce his grabs and gallivats, which were
the ve&s;&s;els on which he had formerly depended. Next year
<PB N="501" REF="511">
his neighbours, the Mahrattas, having &s;ignified to the
pre&s;idency at Bombay, that they were di&s;po&s;ed to join in
the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervice of humbling this common enemy, &s;o
formidable to the whole Malabar coa&s;t, Commodore James
was detached with &s;ome &s;hips of force to attack Angria,
in conjunction with tho&s;e allies. They accordingly joined
him with &s;even grabs and &s;ixty gallivats. They proceeded
to the harbour of Severndroog, where Angria's fleet lay
at anchor: but they no &s;ooner received intelligence of his
approach, than they &s;lipped their cables, and &s;tood out to
&s;ea. He cha&s;ed them with all the canva&s;s he could carry;
but their ve&s;&s;els being lighter than his, they e&s;caped; and
he returned to Severndroog, which is a fortre&s;s &s;ituated on
an i&s;land within mu&s;ket &s;hot of the main land, &s;trongly,
but irregularly fortified, and mounted with fifty four
pieces of cannon. There were three other &s;mall forts on
the continent, the large&s;t of which was called Goa. On
the &s;econd day of April, the Commodore began to batter
and bombard the i&s;land, fort, and Fort Goa, at the &s;ame
time. That of Severndroog was &s;et on fire; one of the
magazines blew up: a general conflagration en&s;ued: the
garri&s;on were overwhelmed with fire and confu&s;ion; the
Engli&s;h &s;eamen landed under cover of the fire from the
&s;hips, and took the place by &s;torm with very little lo&s;s.
The other forts were immediately &s;urrendered, and all of
the&s;e by treaty delivered to the Mahrattas. On the eighth
of April, the Commodore anchored off Bancote, now
called Fort Victoria, one of the mo&s;t northern parts of
Angria's dominions, which &s;urrendered without oppo&s;ition,
and &s;till remains in the hands of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India
company, by the con&s;ent of the Mahrattas. The harbour
is good, and here is a great trade for &s;alt and other com|modities
&s;ent hither from Bombay.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. It was in November following, that the &s;qua|dron
under Admiral Wat&s;on arrived at Bombay, where
it was re&s;olved to give Angria the fini&s;hing &s;troke, &s;till in
conjunction with the Mahrattas. Mean while Commodore
James was &s;ent to reconnoitre Geriah, the capital of his
<PB N="502" REF="512">
dominions, and to &s;ound the depth of the harbour; a
&s;ervice which he &s;ucce&s;sfully performed. The admiral
being joined by a divi&s;ion of &s;hips, fitted out at the com|pany's
expen&s;e, having on board a body of troops com|manded
by Golonel Clive, &s;ailed on the &s;eventh day of
February, and found in the neighbourhood of Geriah the
Mahratta fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of four grabs, and forty &s;maller
ve&s;&s;els, called gallivats, lying to the northward of the
place, in a creek called Rajipore; and a land-army of
hor&s;e and foot, amounting to &s;even or eight thou&s;and men,
the whole commanded by Rhamagee Punt, who had already
taken one &s;mall fort, and was actually treating about the
&s;urrender of Geriah. Angria him&s;elf had quitted the
place; but his wife and family remained under the pro|tection
of his brother-in-law; who, being &s;ummoned to
&s;urrender by a me&s;&s;age from the admiral, replied, that he
would defend the place to the la&s;t extremity. In con&s;e|quence
of this refu&s;al the whole Engli&s;h fleet, in two di|vi&s;ions,
&s;ailed on the twelfth-day of February into the
harbour, and &s;u&s;tained a warm fire from the enemy's batte|ries
as they pa&s;&s;ed, as well as from the grabs po&s;ted in the
harbour for that purpo&s;e: this, however, was &s;oon
&s;ilenced after the &s;hips were brought to their &s;tations, &s;o as
to return the &s;alutation. Between the hours of four and
five in the afternoon, a &s;hell being thrown into one of
Angria's armed ve&s;&s;els, &s;et her on fire; and the flames
communicating to the re&s;t, they were all de&s;troyed: be|tween
&s;ix and &s;even the fort was &s;et on fire by another
&s;hell; and &s;oon after the firing cea&s;ed on both &s;ides. The
admiral, &s;u&s;pecting that the governor of the place would
&s;urrender it to the Mahrattas rather than to the Engli&s;h,
di&s;embarked all the troops under Mr. Clive, that he might
be at hand, in ca&s;e of emergency, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In the
mean time, the fort was bombarded; the line of battle
&s;hips were warped near enough to batter in breach; and
then the admiral &s;ent an officer, with a flag of truce to the
governor, requiring him to &s;urrender. His propo&s;al being
again rejected, the Engli&s;h &s;hips renewed their fire next
<PB N="503" REF="513">
day with redoubled vigour. About one o'clock the maga|zine
of the fort blew up, and at four the garri&s;on hung
out a white flag for capitulation. The parley that en&s;ued
proving ineffectual, the engagement began again, and
continued till fifteen minutes after five: when the white
flag was again di&s;played, and now the governor &s;ubmitted
to the terms which were impo&s;ed. Angria's flag was im|mediately
hauled down; and two Engli&s;h captains taking
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort with a detachment, forthwith hoi&s;ted
the Briti&s;h en&s;ign. To the&s;e captains, who&s;e names
were Buchannan and Forbes, the Mahrattas offered a bribe
of fifty thou&s;and rupees, if they would allow them to pa&s;s
their guard, that they might take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fort for
them&s;elves; but this offer was rejected with di&s;dain, and
immediately di&s;clo&s;ed to Colonel Clive, who took effectual
mea&s;ures to fru&s;trate their de&s;ign. In this place, which
was reduced with very incon&s;iderable lo&s;s, the conquerors
found above two hundred cannon, &s;ix bra&s;s mortars, a
large quantity of ammunition, with money and effects
to the value of one hundred and thirty thou&s;and pounds.
The fleet which was de&s;troyed con&s;i&s;ted of eight grabs, one
&s;hip fini&s;hed, two upon the &s;tocks, and a good number
of gallivats. Among the pri&s;oners, the admiral found
Angria's wife, children, and mother, towards whom he
demeaned him&s;elf with great humanity. Three hundred
European &s;oldiers, and as many &s;epoys, were left to guard
the fort; and four of the company's armed ve&s;&s;els remained
in the harbour for the defence of the place, which was ex|tremely
well &s;ituated for commerce<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">When the admiral entered their apartment, the whole family &s;hedding floods of tears fell with their faces to the ground; from which being ra$$|ed, the mother of Angria told him, in a piteous tone, the people had no king, &s;he no &s;on, her daughter no hu&s;band, their children no father. The admiral replying, &startq;then mu&s;t look upon him as their father and their friend;&endq; the younge&s;t boy, about &s;ix years of age, &s;ei&s;ed him by the hand, and &s;obbing exclaimed, &startq;then you &s;hall be may father.&endq; Mr. Wat$on was &s;o affected with this pathetick addre&s;s, that the tears trickled down his cheeks, while he a&s;&s;ured them they might depend upon his protection and friend&s;hip.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="504" REF="514">
&sect; XLIII. The admiral and Mr. Clive &s;ailed back to
Madra&s;s in triumph, and there another plan was formed
for re&s;toring the company's affairs upon the Ganges, re|covering
Calcutta, and taking vengeance on the cruel
viceroy of Bengal. In October they &s;et &s;ail again for the
bottom of the bay; and about the beginning of December
arrived at Bala&s;ore, in the kingdom of Bengal. Having
cro&s;&s;ed the Braces, they proceeded up the river Ganges as
far as Falta, where they found Governor Drake, and the
other per&s;ons who had e&s;caped on board of the &s;hips when
Calcutta was inve&s;ted. Colonel Clive was di&s;embarked
with his forces, to attack the fort of Bu&s;budgia by land,
while the admiral battered it by &s;ea: but the place being
ill provided with cannon, did not hold out above an hour
after the firing began. This conque&s;t being atchieved at a
very ea&s;y purcha&s;e, two of the great &s;hips anchored be|tween
Tanna fort and a battery on the other &s;ide of the
river, which were abandoned before one &s;hot was di&s;|charged
again&s;t either; thus the pa&s;&s;age was laid open to
Calcutta, the reduction of which we &s;hall record among
the tran&s;actions of the en&s;uing year</P>
