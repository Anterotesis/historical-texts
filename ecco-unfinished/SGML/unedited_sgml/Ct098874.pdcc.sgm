<HEAD>A DISCOURSE Concerning the Nature, Stile, and Extent OF THE <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> HISTORY OF THE CREATION.</HEAD>
<P>_IT being no incon&s;iderable Part of the en&s;uing Theory, to account for the Creation of the World, agreeably to the De&s;cription thereof in the Book of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI>, it cannot but be very nece&s;&s;ary in this Place, to di&s;cour&s;e of the Nature of that Sacred Hi&s;tory, the Stile in which it is Writ, and how far it is to be Extended. The Mi&s;under&s;tanding of which Points has been, I think, the principal Occa&s;ion of tho&s;e Perplexi|ties and Contrarieties into which Men have run with relation to it; while &s;ome have adher'd to the common and vulgar, tho' le&s;s rational Expo|&s;ition; without any Con&s;ideration of Nature, Rea&s;on, Philo&s;ophy, or ju&s;t <HI>Decorum</HI> in the
<PB N="2" REF="13">
&s;everal Parts of it: And Others, on the contra|ry, have been &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Wildne&s;s and Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of <HI>That</HI>, that they have ven|tur'd to exclude it from any ju&s;t Sen&s;e at all; a&s;|&s;erting it to be a meer Popular, Parabolick, or Mythological Relation; in which the plain Let|ter is no more to be accounted for, or believ'd, than the fabulous Repre&s;entations of <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>, or at be&s;t, than the my&s;tical Parables of our Saviour. Of what mi&s;chievous Con&s;equence this latter is commonly e&s;teem'd, I need not &s;ay; a late ex|cellent Author,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>T. Burnet</HI>'s Theory of the Earth, <HI>and</HI> Ar|chaeologiae.</NOTE> who thought it ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be introduc'd, having felt Reflections &s;ufficiently &s;evere, and &s;een Effects &s;ufficiently mi&s;chievous of &s;uch an Interpretation: And how unworthy of God, how incoherent and ab&s;urd the former Expo&s;ition is in it &s;elf, and mu&s;t be e&s;teem'd by free and inqui&s;itive Think|ers, 'tis not difficult to make appear to any im|partial Man, and &s;hall in this Di&s;cour&s;e be par|ticularly attempted. Indeed I cannot but imagine that, As tho&s;e who plead for the Mythological Sen&s;e, do it only becau&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e it impo&s;|&s;ible to give a commodious and rational Scheme of it on any other Hypothe&s;is; and therefore will ea&s;ily and readily embrace any more literal Interpretation which &s;hall agree to the Divine Attributes, the Rea&s;on of their own Minds, and the true Sy&s;tem of the World: So I think tho&s;e who, notwith&s;tanding its apparent Incongruities, adhere to the vulgar Expo&s;ition, will have great rea&s;on to encourage, and re&s;t &s;atisfy'd in &s;uch an Account, as &s;hall at once keep &s;ufficiently clo&s;e to the Letter of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>, and yet be far from allowing what contradicts the Divine Wi&s;|dom, Common Rea&s;on, or Philo&s;ophick De|ductions: To both which therefore, I per&s;uade
<PB N="3" REF="14">
my &s;elf this new Attempt ought not to be unac|ceptable.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e the principal Difficulty is likely to ari&s;e from the Prejudices and Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the latter, and from the vulgar and common Notions already fix'd in the Minds of mo&s;t Men, relating to this <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation; I &s;hall in this Place chiefly have a re&s;pect to them, and endea|vour to evince, That the Notions they have en|tertain'd of the Nature, Stile, and Extent of the Creation of the World in Six Days, are fal&s;e, precarious, and no le&s;s contrary to the Holy Scriptures them&s;elves, than to &s;ound Rea&s;on and true Philo&s;ophy. The Propo&s;ition therefore which &s;hall be the Subject of this Di&s;&s;ertation, and includes the whole Point before us, &s;hall be this: <HI>The</HI> Mo&s;aick <HI>Creation is not a Nice and Philo&s;ophical Account of the Origin of all Things; but an Hi&s;torical and True Repre&s;entation of the Formation of our &s;ingle Earth out of a confus'd Chaos, and of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive and vi&s;ible Changes there|of each Day, till it became the Habitation of Man|kind</HI>.</P>
<P>That this Propo&s;ition is exactly agreeable to that Account, which in the following Theory is given of this Creation, will be evident upon the Peru&s;al thereof; and that the &s;ame Propo&s;i|tion is alike agreeable to the De&s;ign and Stile of the Sacred Penman in the fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Ge|ne&s;is</HI>, is what I am now to make appear. And that I &s;hall endeavour to do by the following Ar|guments; which though they might have been di&s;tingui&s;h'd, and &s;uited to the &s;everal Branches of this A&s;&s;ertion, yet for Ea&s;e I &s;hall wave that Nicene&s;s, and &s;et them down indifferently in that Order they were put into by my own Thoughts, before I intended to adapt them to the ju&s;t Form
<PB N="4" REF="15">
of the foregoing Propo&s;ition: Strength of Rea|&s;oning, more than Exactne&s;s of Compo&s;ure, be|ing the Aim of the Author in this whole Theory: And if he be found to go upon &s;olid Grounds, he hopes the Reader will never the le&s;s embrace the Conclu&s;ions, becau&s;e of the Inaccuracy of the Stile, or Har&s;hne&s;s of the Periods; which wholly to have avoided, he freely owns, would to him have been more tedious and opero&s;e than the Work it &s;elf; and &s;o he hopes 'twill not be expected from him by the Inqui&s;itive Reader: Which Apology once for all he de&s;ires may be accepted, and call'd to mind whenever (as too frequently it will) there &s;hall be Occa&s;ion in the following Pages.</P>
<P N="1">I. The very fir&s;t Words of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> plainly im|ply, That the Production of all the World out of Nothing, which we u&s;ually &s;tile <HI>Creation</HI>, was pre|cedaneous to the Six Days Works, given an Ac|count of in the &s;ame Chapter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.1.</NOTE> <HI>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth</HI>, &s;ays the Scripture; which is, as I take it, a Preface or Introdu|ction to the following Account, and may be thus paraphras'd:
<Q>&startq;Although that Hi&s;tory of the Origin of the World, which &s;hall now be given you, do not extend any farther; as will appear pre&s;ently, than that Earth we live up|on, with tho&s;e Bodies which peculiarly be|long to it; and &s;o the re&s;t of the Univer&s;e be not at all directly concern'd therein; and al|though the &s;ame Hi&s;tory will not reach to the <HI>Creation</HI> of the Matter, but only Production of the Form, and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Earth it &s;elf: Yet, to prevent any Mi&s;under&s;tanding, and obviate any ill Effects of perfect Silence touching the&s;e Things, I am oblig'd, by the
<PB N="5" REF="16">
Divine Command, to a&s;&s;ure you, That the Original of all Beings what&s;oever, was pri|marily owing to that &s;ame God of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>, who&s;e Works I am going to relate; and that not only this Earth, with all its Bodies, but the va&s;t Frame of Univer&s;al Nature, was by him at fir&s;t created out of Nothing, and di|&s;pos'd into tho&s;e &s;everal Sy&s;tems which now are extant, and make up what, in the large&s;t Sen&s;e, is &s;til'd Heaven and Earth, or the whole &endq;World.</Q></P>
<P>This Sen&s;e of the Words is allow'd by our late Excellent Commentator, the Right Reve|rend the late Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely</HI>; who&s;e Sen|timents cannot but be ju&s;tly valued by all who are conver&s;ant in his Expo&s;itions of the Holy Scriptures; and is, I think, not a little confirm'd by the following Words;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.2.</NOTE> <HI>And the Earth was with|out Form and Void, and Darkne&s;s was upon the Face of the Deep, and the Spirit of God moved on the Face of the Waters.</HI> Where 'tis clear, that as &s;oon as the Holy Writer de&s;cends to the De&s;cription of the Chaos, and the commencing of the Six Days Creation, he mentions not a Word of any Production out of Nothing, (before &s;uppos'd and a&s;&s;erted to have been pa&s;t and done, <HI>In the Be|ginning of Things</HI>.) He omits and thereby &s;eems to exclude that <HI>Heaven</HI>, or tho&s;e Superior Sy&s;tems of the World already &s;poken of, from any Place therein: And by the whole Coherence appears to confine the Narration following to the Earth alone, with its Dependances. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> does not &s;ay, as the common Expo&s;itors do,
<Q>&startq;That ju&s;t at the Commencing of the Six Days Work, the Earth, and all the re&s;t of the World was originally produc'd; But that, When God had (formerly) created all the World, which
<PB N="6" REF="17">
u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;h'd into the Heaven and the Earth, the Latter of the&s;e, (the Con&s;ide|ration whereof was alone pertinent to the pre&s;ent De&s;ign) at the Time preceding the Six Days Work, was in a Wild, Irregular, and Dark Condition; or &s;uch a perfect Chaos, as nothing but the Power of God, and his Spirit's moving on, and influencing the &s;ame, could ever have reduc'd into a habitable &endq;World.</Q></P>
<P>This is a very ea&s;y and natural Account of this Matter, and I think the mo&s;t obvious and genuine &s;ignification of the Words them&s;elves. And were not Men's Minds too much prejudic'd with other Apprehen&s;ions, this alone might be &s;ufficient to limit their Thoughts, and prevent their Enquiries after any <HI>Creation of Bodies out of Nothing</HI> in the Six Days Work; and their &s;tretching the &s;ame beyond the Earth, either to the whole Sy&s;tem of Things, as the mo&s;t do; or indeed to the Solar Sy&s;tem, with which others are more mode&s;tly contented in the Ca&s;e. Which two Things once granted me, the Pro|po&s;ition we are now upon would &s;oon be e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd, and little farther Labour become nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>But that I may give all po&s;&s;ible Satisfaction, and lay this Foundation firm, on which my Ac|count of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation is entirely &s;uper|&s;tructed; I &s;hall more at large prove the &s;ame Truths: Craving the Pardon of tho&s;e Readers who are already &s;atisfy'd in the&s;e Matters, if I &s;hall &s;eem to them to in&s;i&s;t too long on a plain Ca&s;e; as perhaps they may (and that I think very ju&s;tly) e&s;teem this to be.</P>
<P>And indeed, The Prejudices of Men are here &s;o great; their ill Opinion of Philo&s;ophical Hy|pothe&s;es
<PB N="7" REF="18">
in the&s;e Ca&s;es &s;o deeply rooted; the At|tempts hitherto made have been &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful, and be&s;ides, the Honour of God in his Holy Word is &s;o much concern'd; and the u&s;ual Ex|po&s;itions of this <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Origin of Things</HI> are &s;o poor, &s;o jejune, &s;o unbecoming the Pen|man, much more the primary Author of the &s;ame; that a large and full Di&s;cour&s;e is but nece&s;&s;ary: And tho' it &s;hould prove &s;omewhat prolix, will be, 'tis hop'd, not improper; but as well &s;ervice|able to Religion as to Philo&s;ophy; by re&s;cu|ing this Ancient, Venerable and Sacred Account of the Origin of Things, from &s;uch fal&s;e and unwary Glo&s;&s;es as have been, and &s;till are put upon it; as have rendred it, in the Opinion of too many, an uncouth and incredible Sy&s;tem; nay, &s;omewhat below &s;ome of tho&s;e <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> which the imperfect Traditions of the Heathen World enabled them to de&s;cribe. To proceed therefore in the Arguments before us, I affirm,</P>
<P N="2">II. That the Words here us'd of <HI>Creating, Making</HI> or <HI>Framing</HI> of Things, on which the main Stre&s;s is laid, in the Stile of Scripture are frequently of no larger Importance than the Propo&s;ition we are upon does allow; and &s;igni|fy no more than the ordering, di&s;po&s;ing, chan|ging, or new modelling tho&s;e Creatures which exi&s;ted already, into a different, and &s;ometimes perhaps a better, and more u&s;eful State than they were in before. I do not &s;ay this is the utmo&s;t, or only Importance of the&s;e Words; I have al|ready allow'd, that Creating, in the fir&s;t Words of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI>, includes Producing out of Nothing; and I add, that in our common Creed, where|in we profe&s;s our <HI>Faith in God the Father Al|mighty,
<PB N="8" REF="19">
Maker of Heaven and Earth</HI>; the Words are, agreeably to the Extent of the Divine Power, and the Nature of that Profe&s;&s;ion, to be taken in the &s;ame large and comprehen&s;ive Sen&s;e: And the like is to be &s;aid of many other Places of the Holy Scripture. But then I ob&s;erve with|al, that the other more narrow and limited Sen&s;e is very common and familiar in the Holy Wri|tings; and therefore, where the Subject-matter and Coherence require it, as I think 'twill be evident they do in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, the&s;e Words both may and ought to be taken in the &s;ame limi|ted Acceptation.</P>
<P>This Signification of the two latter Words <HI>Make</HI> and <HI>Frame</HI>, will, I &s;uppo&s;e, be granted me by all; and that the &s;ame is as true of the other word <HI>Create</HI>, the following Texts will &s;uf|ficiently evince; and from the promi&s;cuous U&s;e of them all, and others of a like Importance, might however be fairly &s;uppos'd. <HI>If</HI>, &s;ays Mo&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. xvi.30.</NOTE> <HI>the Lord make a new thing</HI>, or <HI>Create a Creature, and the Earth open her Mouth and &s;wal|low them up</HI>. Where none can imagine any Thing produc'd out of Nothing; but only &s;uch an un|u&s;ual and miraculous di&s;po&s;al of Things as would at once demon&s;trate God's Vengeance again&s;t the Wicked, and his ab&s;olute Command over all Creatures.<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;a. xlv.7.</NOTE> Thus God him&s;elf &s;ays, <HI>I form the light and Create darkne&s;s; I make peace and Create evil; I the Lord do all the&s;e things</HI>: Where the Objects of the Divine Creation being not real and &s;ub|&s;tantial Beings, could not be capable of a pro|per Production out of Nothing: Which al&s;o is the Ca&s;e in the Ver&s;e immediately following,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 8.</NOTE> <HI>Let righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;pring up together; I the Lord have Created it</HI>. Thus al&s;o, &s;ays God by the &s;ame Prophet;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. lxv.17.</NOTE> <HI>I Create new Heavens and a new Earth</HI>:
<PB N="9" REF="20">
which, tho' the very Ca&s;e before us, yet would oddly enough be expounded of an Annihilation of the World, and a Reproduction of it again. But what comes &s;till more home to our Purpo&s;e is, that in the very Hi&s;tory of the Creation it &s;elf, the word <HI>Create</HI> as well as <HI>Make</HI>, is us'd in the Sen&s;e we contend for; the very &s;ame Things be|ing a&s;crib'd to the Creating and Making Power of God, which are al&s;o de&s;crib'd as the regular Offspring of the Earth and Seas:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.21.</NOTE> <HI>God Created great Whales, and every living Creature that mo|veth; which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind. And God &s;aid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">ver 24, 25.</NOTE> <HI>Let the Earth Bring forth the living Creature after his kind, Cattle and creeping thing, and Bea&s;t of the Earth after his kind; and it was &s;o: And God made the Bea&s;t of the Earth after his kind, and Cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind: And God &s;aw that it was good.</HI></P>
<P>So that &s;ince the Words made u&s;e of in the Hi&s;tory of the Creation are there, and every where taken promi&s;cuou&s;ly; &s;ince &s;ome of them are, by the Confe&s;&s;ion of all, of no larger Im|portance than the Propo&s;ition before us will ad|mit; and &s;ince, la&s;tly, that Word, of which the greate&s;t Doubt can ari&s;e, has been prov'd not only in other Texts of Scripture, but in the very Hi|&s;tory of which we are treating, to be of no more determinate Signification than the re&s;t, and alike capable of the Sen&s;e we here put upon it; I think 'tis a clear Ca&s;e, that if no Argument can be drawn from &s;uch Words <HI>for</HI>, yet neither can there ju&s;tly be any <HI>again&s;t</HI>, that Propo&s;ition we are now upon.</P>
<P N="3">III. Tho&s;e &s;ynonymous Phra&s;es, <HI>The World</HI>; or <HI>the Heavens</HI>, and <HI>the Earth</HI>, under which the Ob|ject

<P>In the &s;ame manner, and with the like fre|quency, the other Phra&s;e, <HI>Heaven and Earth</HI>, de|notes the &s;ame &s;ix days work al&s;o: <HI>Thus the Hea|vens and the Earth were fini&s;h'd, and all the Ho&s;t of them.

In &s;ix days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and re&s;ted the &s;eventh day</HI>; which being &s;o expre&s;s, I &s;hall not need to look out for any other parallel places.</P>

<P>In an&s;wer whereto, I freely confe&s;s, That the <HI>Heavens and the Earth</HI> do <HI>not &s;eldom</HI> denote the

entire Univer&s;e; an In&s;tance of which the fir&s;t words of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> have already afforded us; but that they <HI>always</HI> do &s;o, I have rea&s;on to deny. As the Signification of the <HI>Earth</HI> is known, and capable of no Ambiguity, &s;o 'tis quite other|wi&s;e with the word <HI>Heaven</HI>, which in common u&s;e, and the &s;acred Authors, &s;ometimes refers to the Seat of the Ble&s;&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. xii.2.</NOTE> or, in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Phra&s;e, the <HI>third Heaven</HI>; &s;ometimes to the Place of the Sun, Moon, and Stars; and otherwhiles is no far|ther to be extended than the Clouds, or the open <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> about the Earth, where the Air, At|mo&s;phere, Meteors, Clouds and Volatils, have their Abode. In&s;tances of the two former Signi|fications, were it pertinent to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, might ea&s;ily be produc'd; but that not being &s;o, I &s;hall wave the &s;ame, and only prove the third and la&s;t Signification, namely, That by the <HI>Heavens</HI> is frequently under&s;tood nothing more than the Atmo&s;phere of the Earth, with its appendant or contained Bodies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.7, 8.</NOTE>Thus, <HI>God made the Firmament, and divided the Waters which were under the Firmament, from the Waters which were above the Firmament; and it was &s;o.

By all which Places 'tis evident, That the word <HI>Heaven</HI> is commonly &s;o far from including the Sun or Planetary <HI>Chorus</HI>, (much le&s;s the fix'd Stars, with all their immen&s;e Sy&s;tems) that the Moon, our attending and Neighbour Pla|net, is not taken in: The utmo&s;t Bounds of our <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI>, being &s;o of this our <HI>Heaven</HI> al&s;o: which was the only Point which remain'd to be clear'd.</P>
<P>But here, before I proceed further, I mu&s;t take notice of a con&s;iderable Objection, which threatens to wre&s;t this Argument out of my Hands, and indeed to &s;ubvert the entire Founda|tion of the Propo&s;ition before us; and is, I free|ly own, the main Difficulty in this whole Mat|ter; and 'tis this, That &s;uch a Sen&s;e of the Words, <HI>World</HI>, and <HI>Heaven</HI>, and <HI>Earth</HI>, as has been plead|ed for, whatever may be &s;aid in other Ca&s;es, will yet by no means fit here, nor take in all the Extent of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation; becau&s;e 'tis cer|tain, that neither the Light, by who&s;e Revolu|tion Night and Day are di&s;tingui&s;h'd; nor the Sun, Moon, and Stars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.14, 15, 17.</NOTE> which are &s;et in that <HI>Fir|mament of Heaven</HI> of which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;peaks, be|long to our Atmo&s;phere, or are limited by tho&s;e Boundaries, within which we confine the pre&s;ent Hi&s;tory; and 'tis equally certain, that both of them pertain to the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation, and are the fir&s;t and fourth Days Works therein; and by con&s;equence, it may be &s;aid, the Subject of the &s;ix Days Creation mu&s;t be the whole
<PB N="14" REF="25">
Sy&s;tem of the heavenly Bodies, or at lea&s;t that particular one in which the Earth is, and is &s;til'd the <HI>Solar Sy&s;tem</HI>.</P>
<P>Now this Objection is in part already taken off by the Sen&s;e in which the Production and Creation of Things has been &s;hewn to be fre|quently taken in the Holy Scriptures; whereby there appears to be no Nece&s;&s;ity of believing the&s;e Bodies to have been then originally <HI>brought into Being</HI>, when they are fir&s;t mention'd in the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e this is not meerly the chief, but only con&s;iderable Objection again&s;t the Propo|&s;ition we are upon; becau&s;e it &s;eems to have been the principal Occa&s;ion of Men's Mi&s;takes and Prejudices about this whole Hi&s;tory; and becau&s;e 'tis the &s;ingle In&s;tance wherein this en|tire Theory, &s;o far as I know, &s;eems to recede from the obvious Letter of Scripture; 'twill be but proper to give it a particular Review, and clear withal, not only this, but &s;everal other like Expre&s;&s;ions and Pa&s;&s;ages, in the Holy Scripture.</P>
<P>Now, in order to the giving what Satisfaction I can in this Point; let it be con&s;ider'd, That as to the fir&s;t Point, the Creation of Light on the fir&s;t Day, it is not at all a&s;&s;erted in the Hi&s;tory; but only that then it fir&s;t appear'd in the World: <HI>God &s;aid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.3, 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>Let there be light, and there was light. And God &s;aw the light that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkne&s;s. And God called the light Day, and the darkne&s;s he called Night.</HI> And, indeed, Light does not &s;eem ca|pable it &s;elf of <HI>Creation out of nothing</HI> in a pro|per Sen&s;e; tho' the luminous Body from whence 'tis deriv'd be &s;o. And accordingly St. <HI>Paul</HI>,
<PB N="15" REF="26">
with reference to this very Day's Work, expre&s;&s;es it exceeding properly, when he &s;ays,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. iv.6.</NOTE> that <HI>God</HI> at this Time <HI>commanded the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s</HI>. Which original Commencement of the Light upon the Face of the Earth this fir&s;t Day of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation being not only allow'd, but particularly accounted for in the following Theory, this can be no Difficulty in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. The Creation therefore of the Heavenly Bodies, the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, is the &s;ole remaining Difficulty in the Ca&s;e before us. And that would appear not &s;o hard, if the Tran&s;lation of the Words of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> were but amend|ed, and the Ver&s;es hereto relating, read thus: <HI>And God &s;aid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.14, 15, 16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>Let there be lights in the firma|ment of the Heaven, to divide the day from the night; and let them be for &s;igns, and for &s;ea&s;ons, and for days, and years; and let them be for lights in the firmament of the Heaven, to give light upon the Earth; and it was &s;o. And God having</HI> (before) <HI>made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the le&s;&s;er light to rule the night; and having</HI> (before) <HI>made the &s;tars al&s;o, God &s;et them in the firmament of Heaven, to give light upon the Earth</HI>, &amp;c. or, which is all one, <HI>And God had</HI> (before) <HI>made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the le&s;&s;er light to rule the night; he had</HI> (before) <HI>made the &s;tars al&s;o: and God &s;et them in the firmament</HI>, &amp;c. In which Rendring, 'tis only changing the <HI>perfectum</HI> for the <HI>plu&s;quam perfectum</HI>, and every Thing is clear and ea&s;y, and the Objection vani&s;hes of its own ac|cord; the Creation of the heavenly Bodies be|ing hereby a&s;&s;igned to a former Time, and the Work of the fourth Day no other than the pla|cing them in our Firmament; according as the Account hereafter to be given does require.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="27">Now to prove this a fair and ju&s;t Interpre|tation, (to omit that the <HI>Creation</HI> of the Hea|vens and Heavenly Bodies had been related <HI>be|fore</HI> the &s;ix Days Work) 'tis only nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Tongue having no <HI>plu&s;quam perfectum</HI>, mu&s;t, and does &s;ometimes expre&s;s the Sen&s;e of it by the <HI>perfectum</HI>; and that, accordingly, the particular Circum&s;tances of each Place mu&s;t alone determine when there|by the Time pre&s;ent, and when that already pa&s;t and gone, is to be under&s;tood.

<P>And tho' the fourth day's work is among tho&s;e other, where no &s;uch alteration need be made; in which therefore it may &s;eem hard to allow of a &s;ingle in&s;tance again&s;t the u&s;e in the precedent and &s;ub&s;equent Context in the fir&s;t Chapter, yet the circum&s;tances of that day being peculiar; the like mixture of the <HI>perfectum</HI> and <HI>plu&s;quam perfectum</HI> being in the &s;econd Chapter, and in other places of Scripture to be ob&s;erv'd; and a di&s;tinct work being &s;till hereby pre&s;erv'd to that day, the placing the Sun, Moon, and Stars in our Fir|mament, which otherwi&s;e is after a &s;ort dou|ble; do all, in good mea&s;ure, take away the force of &s;uch Rea&s;oning, and con&s;pire to allow us that Interpretation before given, and thereby to &s;ecure the Propo&s;ition before us from that grand Objection which &s;eemed capable of cau|&s;ing &s;o great an ob&s;truction in our cour&s;e.

<P>And here I ob&s;erve, That the Scripture all along accommodates its &s;elf to the vulgar Appre|hen&s;ions of Men, with relation to &s;uch Points of Natural Philo&s;ophy as they were not able to comprehend; and in particular, with relation to the Site, Di&s;tance, Magnitude, U&s;e, and Mo|tions of the Heavenly Bodies.

Earth, with all its Dependances; yet are they rarely, if ever, &s;o con&s;ider'd in the Holy Scri|ptures.

<P>God has &s;o fram'd the Eyes of Men, that when the di&s;tance of Bodies, and their proper Magnitude is very great, they &s;hall both be im|perceptible to us. There is every way from our Eye a &s;pherical Di&s;tance or Superficies which ter|minates our di&s;tinct Perception of Objects; and beyond which, all Di&s;tances and Magnitudes, ab|&s;olutely con&s;idered, are not by us di&s;tingui&s;hable. The Clouds, tho' lying parallel to the Horizon, they are (&s;o far as comes at once within our view) almo&s;t in the &s;ame Plane, yet to us they &s;eem bent into a concave Figure, or kind of He|mi&s;pherical Superficies, almo&s;t equidi&s;tant on eve|ry Side from its Center, the Eye of the Specta|tor, and &s;o &s;eem every way to touch the Ground at a Mile or two di&s;tance from him. And this hap|pens by rea&s;on of the Imperfection of our Sight, which di&s;tingui&s;hing remote Objects but to a certain di&s;tance, beyond which the Clouds are, can have no other Idea of their Situation than &s;mall and like Objects at that Spherical Superficies would excite. On which Principle 'tis certain, that till Geometrick and Philo&s;ophick Principles rectify Men's Notions, all Bodies what&s;oever be|yond the Clouds, &s;uch as the Cele&s;tial are, mu&s;t needs be e&s;teem'd at the &s;ame equidi&s;tant Superficies with the Clouds, and appear among them, and by con&s;equence 'twould be on this account, as po&s;&s;ible for the Vulgar to be per|&s;uaded that the Clouds were va&s;tly remote from, and bear no relation to this Earth, as that the Sun, Moon, and Stars were &s;o; and to them as &s;trange to have found no account of the Forma|tion of them with that of the other vi&s;ible World,

to be agreeable to the Sacred Stile in other places. Now 'tis ea&s;y to tell what is meant by their Creation in the ca&s;e before us, when it has ap|pear'd that their Production out of nothing was precedaneous to the &s;ix days Work, and that they are wholly con&s;ider'd as belonging to our Earth, and plac'd in our Air; <HI>viz. Their primary being &s;o plac'd; their fir&s;t becoming vi&s;ible to Men on Earth</HI>, or in other words, <HI>their Original Appear|ing there</HI>. I mean in plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>, Light is &s;aid then fir&s;t to <HI>Be</HI>, (for it being an effect of the Heavenly Bodies, not a di&s;tinct thing from them, is not by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>, as I have already noted, &s;aid to be <HI>made</HI> or <HI>Created</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.3.</NOTE>) when the &s;uperior Regions of the Chaos were become &s;o far clear and de|fecate, that the Rays of the Sun in &s;ome degree could penetrate the &s;ame, enough to render a &s;en|&s;ible Di&s;tinction between Night and Day, or that &s;pace the Sun was above, and that it was beneath the Horizon. And agreeably, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, are then &s;aid fir&s;t to <HI>Be</HI>, or to <HI>be made</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver&s;e 14, 16.</NOTE> when afterwards the Air was rendred &s;o very clear and tran&s;parent, that tho&s;e Lumina|ries became con&s;picuous, and their Bodies di&s;tinct|ly vi&s;ible, as in a clear Day or Night they now appear to us.</P>
<P>That this Expo&s;ition is agreeable to the Scri|pture Stile, is evident by this Ob&s;ervation, That &s;everal things are there affirm'd to <HI>Be</HI>, in any certain manner, when only tho&s;e effects we feel are &s;uch as they would be were they &s;o indeed; and 'tis not unu&s;ual to a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Being</HI> of any Cau&s;e, when all tho&s;e con&s;equences are no other|wi&s;e in the World, and with regard to Men, than they mu&s;t and would be upon its real Ex|i&s;tence, without any exacter nicene&s;s as to the truth of the &s;ame. Thus God is &s;aid &s;everal times
<PB N="25" REF="36">
to <HI>repent</HI> of &s;omewhat he had before done, when his future Actions are the very &s;ame as would in Human, as well as Divine Affairs, be the cer|tain con&s;equences of a proper Repentance: Thus al&s;o God is &s;aid to be <HI>pleas'd</HI> or <HI>angry</HI> with Men, and that in a very <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate</HI> and <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> manner, when he confers &s;uch great Mercies, or inflicts &s;uch great Judgments, as were he really &s;o, he mu&s;t naturally do. Thus al&s;o <HI>Eyes</HI> and <HI>Ears</HI> are frequently &s;uppos'd of God, becau&s;e he as cer|tainly is con&s;cious of all the Actions and Speeches of Men, as if he really &s;aw and heard the &s;ame. In a different in&s;tance, The Sun is &s;aid to <HI>&s;tand &s;till</HI> or <HI>move</HI>, tho' in propriety of Speech, as is now well known, tho&s;e affections ought to be a&s;crib'd to the Earth, becau&s;e every thing, as to &s;en&s;ible appearance, is in the &s;ame condition as from the Annual and Diurnal Motions of the Sun, were they real, mu&s;t, and would obtain. The Sun is &s;aid to be <HI>turn'd into Darkne&s;s, and the Moon in|to Blood</HI>, as was ju&s;t now ob&s;erv'd, when, without any alteration in them&s;elves, they appear of a dark or bloody Countenance to the Inhabitants of the Earth. Nay, which is mo&s;t of all to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, God is then &s;aid to <HI>make all things new</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apoc. xx 5. I&s;a. lxv.17.</NOTE> and to <HI>create a new Heaven, and a new Earth</HI>, when, at the utmo&s;t, he &s;o changes the Con&s;titu|tion and State of our Earth, as to render there|by this whole Sublunary World very different from, and much excelling that which formerly appear'd. In all which, and innumerable other In&s;tances, 'tis plain and evident, that the Holy Writers do not con&s;ider merely how things <HI>are</HI> in them&s;elves, but how they are <HI>to us</HI>; not what is their proper <HI>nature</HI>, but vi&s;ible <HI>appearance</HI> in the World.</P>
<P>But here, le&s;t this Doctrine &s;hould be abus'd,
<PB N="26" REF="37">
I mu&s;t interpo&s;e this nece&s;&s;ary caution, That &s;uch a liberty is neither by other Authors, nor the Sacred Penmen taken on all occa&s;ions, or in every ca&s;e; but peculiarly when the &s;ublimity of the Matter, the capacities of the People, the more ea&s;y in&s;tilling u&s;eful Principles into Men, or &s;ome other weighty rea&s;on, requires &s;uch an accommodation. 'Tis chiefly with regard to the Spiritual Nature, and &s;ublime way of operation in God; or &s;uch Phy&s;ical and Philo&s;ophick Truths, as relate to di&s;tant, invi&s;ible, or inac|ce&s;&s;ible bodies; the ab&s;olute E&s;&s;ences or Affecti|ons whereof, were not explicable to the vulgar in a plain and natural manner. In which ca&s;es this Liberty in the Interpretation of Scripture is, with the greate&s;t Ju&s;tice to be allow'd. But 'twere thence very unrea&s;onable to extend it to all others, or indeed to any, where the &s;ame, or as good Rea&s;ons were not a&s;&s;ignable. He who &s;hould argue, that becau&s;e the Literal &s;en&s;e of Scripture about the Corporeal Members, and Human Pa&s;&s;ions of the Divine Nature, is not to be &s;trictly urg'd; that therefore when he is call'd a <HI>Spirit</HI>, and repre&s;ented as the Rewarder of Good, and the Puni&s;her of Bad Men, tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions are no more to be depended on; or he who &s;hould infer, that becau&s;e the Fir&s;t and Fourth Days Work, the Origin of Light, and the making of the Heavenly Bodies, mu&s;t not be &s;trictly literal, that therefore neither in the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation, ought the other four to be any more e&s;teemed &s;o; He, I &s;ay, that &s;hould thus argue or infer, would be very unfair and unrea&s;onable; becau&s;e he would a&s;&s;ert that in one ca&s;e, without ground, which on peculiar and weighty ones alone was allow'd in another. Thus tho&s;e things that are a&s;crib'd to God,
<PB N="27" REF="38">
which evidently agree to his Nature and Idea, are &s;ure to be literally under&s;tood; tho' the other which are repugnant thereto be not: And in like manner, 'tis but ju&s;t to believe, that &s;o much of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation, as related di|rectly to the Earth and its appurtenances, and &s;o came at once within the comprehen&s;ion of the Hi&s;tory, and of the capacities of the Readers, ought literally to be interpreted; tho' &s;ome things extraneous to the Formation of the Earth, and beyond the notice of the People, be to be taken in a different acceptation. Tho' the com|mon u&s;e of Tropes and Figures make our Speech very often not to be <HI>literal</HI>, yet generally we can under&s;tand one another very well without dan|ger of deception, or of turning plain Sentences into Allegorical Di&s;cour&s;es, in our Conver&s;ation one with another.</P>
<P>And 'tis evident that the Holy Books ought not to be tormented or eluded, as to their ob|vious &s;en&s;e, on every occa&s;ion, under pretence that &s;ome particular Texts are to be con&s;trued another way. That SACRED RULE ought for ever RELIGIOUSLY to be ob&s;erv'd, <HI>That we never for&s;ake the plain, obvious, ea&s;y and natural &s;en&s;e, unle&s;s where the nature of the thing it &s;elf, parallel places, or evident rea&s;on, afford a &s;olid and &s;ufficient ground for &s;o doing</HI>.</P>
<P>Now this being pre&s;uppos'd, I &s;hall leave it to the imparrial Reader to judge, after the peru|&s;al of this whole di&s;cour&s;e, whether I have not &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons for the pre&s;ent Expo&s;ition; and whether therefore, any one ought to blame my receding from the Letter in this &s;ingle Ca&s;e, or imagine that I give a ju&s;t handle thereby to others, to Allegorize away this Hi&s;tory of the Creation, or any other parts of Scripture.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="39">And I mu&s;t here own and profe&s;s, That tho' I think, in ca&s;e the common Tran&s;lation be re|ceiv'd, there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of receding from the Letter in the point before us, and that this Venerable and Sacred <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or Hi&s;tory of the Creation, is otherwi&s;e in the highe&s;t de|gree &s;trange and unaccountable to the free Rea|&s;on of Mankind; yet I am fully of opinion, that generally the difficulties occurring in the Sacred Books are to be clear'd, not by a greater receding from, but a clo&s;er adhering to the ob|vious and mo&s;t natural Interpretation of the Pe|riods therein contain'd: And that, the general nature of the Scripture Stile every where duly ob&s;erv'd and con&s;ider'd, &s;everal great &s;cruples with relation to the Actions and Providence of God, and other things contain'd in tho&s;e Books, would be taken away, if we might be allow'd to recede a little from the receiv'd opinions of Men, and Placits of Sy&s;tematical Authors; on no other condition than that, for a recompence, we keep &s;o much the clo&s;er to the Oracles of God, and the obvious and literal Interpretation of them; and explain the Bible no otherwi&s;e than the plain words them&s;elves would appear mo&s;t naturally to intend to any di&s;intere&s;ted and unconcern'd Per&s;on: Of which many In&s;tances might ea&s;ily be given, were this a proper place for it.

Now though many might ea&s;ily be alledg'd for this procedure, yet I &s;hall include the main I intend here to in&s;i&s;t on in the two following:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="29" REF="40">(1.) The Advantage of the <HI>Jews</HI>, or &s;ecu|ring them from the Adoration of the Ho&s;t of Heaven, could not otherwi&s;e have been provided for. Now as the foundation of &s;uch Idolatry is taken away by their being included in this Hi&s;tory, which imply'd them to be &s;uch depen|dent and created Beings, as could have no influ|ence of <HI>their own</HI>, but what were deriv'd <HI>from God</HI>; and con&s;equently were &s;ubject to his di&s;po|&s;al and Government; which affirm'd them to be <HI>by Him</HI> plac'd in the Firmament, and there &s;ub|jected to &s;uch Motions, Rules and Laws, by which they became advantageous and &s;erviceable to the World: So had they been taken no notice of, they would have &s;eem'd exempted Bodies, and when all Wor&s;hip of Terre&s;trial things was demon&s;trated by this account of their original, to be fooli&s;h and ab&s;urd, that of the <HI>Cele&s;tial Bodies</HI> would &s;eem thereby to be permitted at lea&s;t, if not patroniz'd and recommended to 'em.</P>
<P>For &s;ince, as we have before ob&s;erv'd, 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for the <HI>Jews</HI> to know the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e, and to apprehend that they were va&s;tly remote from, and &s;o no way belonging to this Earth, or its Formation; there was no other way to apply a fitting remedy to that prevailing cu&s;tom of wor&s;hipping the Ho&s;t of Heaven (&s;o particularly caution'd by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>) but to conde|&s;cend to the Capacities of the People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. iv.19. &amp; xvii.3.</NOTE> and &s;up|po&s;ing them Light and Fiery Globes pendulous in the Air, and revolving ju&s;t beyond or among the Clouds, as they appear'd to them to do, to recount their <HI>re&s;pective</HI>, as well as the <HI>real</HI> For|mation of the other parts of the vi&s;ible World; and a&s;&s;ign them their proper place and di&s;tinct period in the Six days work, as well as any
<PB N="30" REF="41">
other more directly concern'd therein. The Sun, Moon and Stars, were &s;uch noble and glorious Bodies, and &s;o vi&s;ible, &s;o remarkable, &s;o u&s;eful parts of the World; and the Heathen Nations &s;o generally doted on the Wor&s;hip of them, that had they been entirely omitted in this par|ticular account of Origin of things, there would have been the mo&s;t eminent danger of this kind of Idolatry among the <HI>Jews</HI>; and the &s;eeming approbation of that practice, to which they were &s;o prone before, from the &s;ilence of their great Lawgiver in his Creation of the World, might probably have defy'd all di&s;&s;ua&s;ions, and been the mo&s;t fatal encouragement to &s;o vile a Wor|&s;hip that were ea&s;y to be imagin'd. Any par|ticular declaration of the rea&s;ons of &s;uch omi&s;|&s;ion, from the real Di&s;tance, Magnitude, Mo|tions, and De&s;igns of the &s;aid Bodies, and how improperly they could be reduc'd within the &s;aid narration (the only precaution &s;uppo&s;able in the ca&s;e) being more likely to di&s;credit the whole Book, than overcome their prejudices; than give them a true and ju&s;t Idea of the matter it &s;elf, and &s;o obviate their fal&s;e rea&s;onings and practices thereupon in the foremention'd Idolatry. So that 'twas ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to include the Heavenly Bodies in the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation, in or|der to prevent Idolatry among the <HI>Jews:</HI> which &s;eems to have been a principal aim not only of recording this whole Narration, but of the en|tire <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation; and therefore was in the fir&s;t place by all means to be con&s;ider'd and provided for.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The peculiar Nature and Circum&s;tances of this Hi&s;tory of the Creation, nece&s;&s;arily re|quire the mention of the Heavenly Bodies, as well as of any other parts of the Vi&s;ible World. And
<PB N="31" REF="42">
'tis this mi&s;take that has hitherto hindred any rational account thereof; that Men have either &s;uppos'd it a Real and Philo&s;ophical relation of the proper Creation of all things; or a meer Mythological and My&s;terious Reduction of the vi&s;ible part of it to &s;ix periods or divi&s;ions, un|der which mighty My&s;teries were &s;uppos'd to be hid, and by which the foundation of a &s;eventh-day Sabbath was to be laid among the <HI>Jews</HI>. Now tho' &s;omewhat of truth may po&s;&s;ibly be con|tained in each of the&s;e different notions; yet I think 'tis undeniable, that they are neither of them to be acquie&s;ced in, and by no means give a &s;atisfactory account of the compleat Nature and Kind of this Hi&s;tory. That alone to which all its particulars exactly an&s;wer, and which is as Literal and Philo&s;ophical as the capacities of the <HI>Jews</HI> could expect or reach, and did require, is, <HI>An Hi&s;torical Journal or Diary of the Muta|tions of the Chaos, and of the vi&s;ible Works of each Day, &s;uch an one as an hone&s;t and ob&s;erving Specta|tor on the Earth would have made, and recorded, nay and believ'd to be in all ca&s;es the truth and the reality of the things them&s;elves</HI>. Now that this Idea alone fits this Sacred Hi&s;tory, might ea&s;ily be made out by the con&s;ideration of the particulars related, and of tho&s;e omitted, with all the other circum|&s;tances thereof, by no means corre&s;ponding to any other Hypothe&s;is; but mo&s;t exactly to this before us; without the lea&s;t force offer'd to the Nature and Sy&s;tem of the World, to the Divine Perfections, or the Free Rea&s;on of Mankind; and exactly &s;uitable to the Stile of the Holy Books, in the mention of the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Natural World in other places. For as to that Objection again&s;t this Nature of the Hexame|ron, That it cannot be that of <HI>An Hi&s;torical Jour|nal,

&s;uch as a Spectator on the Earth would have made</HI>; becau&s;e 'tis &s;uppos'd there was then no &s;uch Spectator in being to make it; I &s;hall an|&s;wer in the words of my Reply formerly made to it, that this Argument is, I think, neither Conclu&s;ive nor True. For tho' there were no real Spectator at fir&s;t, yet the nature of the Hi|&s;tory might, for good rea&s;ons, be &s;uch as I a&s;&s;ign notwith&s;tanding.

Which Journal being &s;uppos'd, (and by that time this Di&s;&s;ertation is con&s;ider'd throughout, I hope 'twill appear no precarious &s;uppo&s;ition) 'tis evident that both the appear|ance of Light, and of the Bodies them&s;elves, the Sun, Moon and Stars, (the things we are now enquiring about) mu&s;t as certainly come within its limits, and make as remarkable Turns and Changes in the World, as far as a Spectator could judge, as any other within the entire &s;ix days could po&s;&s;ibly do. The appear|ance of Light to him who never before is &s;up|pos'd to have &s;een &s;uch a thing, and mu&s;t have been till then incompa&s;s'd with the thicke&s;t Darkne&s;s; and the plain view of the Heavenly Bodies them&s;elves to him who before had no manner of notion of 'em, e&s;pecially when he had no natural means of di&s;tingui&s;hing them from Light and fiery Balls, &s;ituate ju&s;t above, and pertaining to the Clouds; mu&s;t as certainly have inferr'd a new Creation, and under &s;uch a notion have been recorded in their due place in the Journal before|mention'd, as any other what&s;oever; and their order, po&s;ition, and u&s;es would naturally be re|counted
<PB N="33" REF="44">
no otherwi&s;e than we now find them in the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation.

<P>And that the <HI>Chaos</HI> is here confin'd to <HI>the Earth</HI>, will &s;ure appear more credible by the lat|ter Branch of this Argument, which ob&s;erves no other Parts to be mention'd belonging thereto, than &s;uch as the &s;ucceeding Series of the Holy Scriptures, as well as the known <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature &s;hew to have afterward belong'd to our Earth and no other, <HI>viz.</HI> An <HI>Aby&s;s</HI> or Deep, and <HI>Waters</HI>: Both of them frequently mention'd in the Holy Books, and now actual Parts of the pre&s;ent Globe, as will appear hereafter.</P>

as afterward, and at this Day, are Parts of our Earth; 'tis &s;omewhat unaccountable, and like a kind of Fate upon Commentators, that they &s;hould unanimou&s;ly re&s;olve to make this <HI>Chaos</HI> of &s;o extravagant a Compa&s;s as they too incon|gruou&s;ly do; and that they &s;hould agree in it &s;o univer&s;ally, tho' without any Warrant from, nay, contrary to, the obvious Sen&s;e of the Text it &s;elf, and the plain Drift, Coherence and De&s;cri|ption of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> therein. I know it will be &s;aid, the Fir&s;t and Fourth Days Works, (the Origin of Light, and of the Sun, Moon and Stars) ne|ce&s;&s;itated &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition, and gave ju&s;t Cau&s;e for the common Expo&s;ition. Which as I be|lieve to have been the true Occa&s;ions of all &s;uch mi&s;taken Glo&s;&s;es, &s;o I think them far from ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary ones; and if what has been already &s;aid has clear'd tho&s;e Difficulties, there can be no Rea&s;on to reject the Cogency of the pre&s;ent Argument, but a great deal to re&s;t &s;atisfied in it; and to confe&s;s it no le&s;s Un&s;criptural, than 'tis Ab&s;urd, to expect from this &s;ingle <HI>Chaos</HI>, a Sun, Moon, and Sy&s;tems of fix'd Stars, as hitherto the World has commonly done.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> and ancient <HI>Chaos</HI> could not include the Sun of fix'd Stars, becau&s;e ju&s;t before the Extraction of Light from it, as 'tis u&s;ually explain'd, it was Dark and Caliginous; which on &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition is not conceivable. A &s;trange Darkne&s;s this!<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. <HI>Lem.</HI> 36. <HI>infr&agrave;</HI>.</NOTE> where more than ninety nine Parts of an Hundred (whether we take in the entire Sy&s;tem of the World, or the Solar Sy&s;tem only) appear to be fiery Corpu&s;cles, and the very &s;ame from whence all the fix'd Stars, or at lea&s;t the Sun, were con&s;tituted; and are now the Fountain of all that Light and Heat which the World has ever &s;ince enjoy'd. Let every un|bia&s;s'd
<PB N="37" REF="48">
Per&s;on judge, how dark that <HI>Chaos</HI> could be, where the Opake and ob&s;cure Parts were &s;o perfectly incon&s;iderable in Compari&s;on of the Light, the Active, and the Fiery ones. So that on this Hypothe&s;is, the State of the <HI>Chaos</HI> mu&s;t have been exceeding Light, Hot, and Fiery, be|fore the fir&s;t Day's Work; when it was on the contrary, according to all Antiquity, Sacred and Profane, Dark and Caliginous. 'Tis true, upon the Separation of the Particles of Light, (the Bu&s;ine&s;s, in this Hypothe&s;is, of the Fir&s;t Day) the <HI>Chaos</HI> would become Ob&s;cure and Dark enough, at the &s;ame time that the Sun, or fix'd Stars, were collecting their Ma&s;&s;es &s;o lately extracted, and were growing Splendid and Glorious. But this is to contradict the Hi&s;tory, according to which the Light, on the fir&s;t Day, is con&s;ider'd with relation to the <HI>Chaos</HI>, and its di&s;tingui&s;hing Night and Day <HI>There</HI>; not as it was collecting into Bo|dies of Light without it, (which rather mu&s;t belong to the Fourth Day's Work;) when by this Account 'tis evident, that this Day is the pe|culiar Time for the mo&s;t pitchy Darkne&s;s po&s;&s;i|ble; for when all the Light was ju&s;t &s;eparated from the <HI>Chaos</HI>, the mo&s;t Caliginous Night mu&s;t certainly en&s;ue. So that unle&s;s we can change the Order in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>, and prove that the <HI>Chaos before</HI> the Fir&s;t Day's Work was all over Light, and on the Fir&s;t Day cover'd with the thicke&s;t Darkne&s;s, we in vain pretend to ju&s;tify the vul|gar Opinion, and include the Sun or fix'd Stars among the other Matter of the <HI>Chaos</HI>.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;ince Heat is the main In&s;trument of Nature in all its Separations of Parts, and Pro|ductions of Bodies, 'tis &s;ure a very improper Sea|&s;on ju&s;t then to extract the light and fiery Cor|pu&s;cles out of the <HI>Chaos</HI>, when the Formation

of Things began, and there was the principal Occa&s;ion for their Pre&s;ence and Efficacy, that ever was, or could po&s;&s;ibly be. A &s;trange Me|thod of Generation! To take away the Cau&s;e at the very In&s;tant when it was to produce its Ef|fects; and to recount the Effects not before, but as &s;oon as ever the Cau&s;e is taken away! But to proceed.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The now undoubted Property of the univer&s;al Gravitation of Matter, contradicts and overthrows this Fancy of the heavenly Bodies having been originally included in, and at the Creation extracted from the <HI>Chaos</HI> of which we are &s;peaking. For on this Hypothe&s;is, in ca&s;e they once were mingled with the Parts of the Earth, &s;ince they are now at immen&s;e Di&s;tances from it, they mu&s;t have fled off every Way from their former Place, and in a &s;mall Space of time have thrown them&s;elves to tho&s;e va&s;tly remote Seats which they have ever &s;ince po&s;&s;e&s;s'd. Now if in&s;tead of the <HI>vis centripeta</HI>, a <HI>vis centrifuga</HI>; in&s;tead of mutual Attraction, a mutual Repul&s;e or Avoidance were found to be the &s;tanding un|chang'd Law of Nature, and Property of Mat|ter, this might have look'd like a po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t, if not a probable Hypothe&s;is; and the whole Order of Nature ever &s;ince need not have been contradicted in this primary Formation of Things. But &s;ince the contrary Force, that I mean of mutual Tendency, Attraction, or Gravi|tation obtains, and that, as far as we have any means of knowing, univer&s;ally, which Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> has demon&s;trated, there is no Room or Foundation in Nature for &s;uch an Imagination.</P>
<P>'Tis by no Means impo&s;&s;ible, that all the Bo|dies in the Univer&s;e &s;hould approach to one ano|ther, and at la&s;t unite in the common Center of

But by what Law of Nature, or Property of Bodies, they, when once conjoin'd, (as tho&s;e I now oppo&s;e mu&s;t affirm) &s;hould be &s;eparated, 'tis hard to conceive.</P>
<P>Which Difficulty is increas'd by the prodigious Velocity of their Motions; &s;ince, according to the vulgar Hypothe&s;is, but a few Hours can be allow'd the Heavenly Bodies to wa&s;t them to tho&s;e immen&s;ly, yet variou&s;ly di&s;tant Seats, which they were immediately and for ever after to po&s;&s;e&s;s. All which har&s;h and ungrounded Fictions are entirely avoided, and all things re|pre&s;ented according to the known Laws of Mat|ter and Motion, in that natural and ea&s;y Hypo|the&s;is we take; and which therefore is as con&s;o|nant to, as the other is aver&s;e from, the Make and Con&s;titution of the Natural World.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) This Fancy, that the Heavenly Bodies proceeded originally from the Terre&s;trial <HI>Chaos</HI>, and ca&s;t them&s;elves off from it every way, &s;up|po&s;es the Earth to be the Center of the World, or of all that Sy&s;tem of Bodies; and they plac'd in a Kind of Circumference every way about it. How well &s;oever &s;uch a Notion would agree with the Vulgar or <HI>Ptolemaick</HI> Sy&s;tem of the World, I fear the <HI>Pythagorean</HI>, which has forc'd its Reception, and is univer&s;ally receiv'd by A&s;tro|nomers, will not at all &s;quare therewith. In that Account which would only include the Pla|netary or Solar Sy&s;tem within the &s;ix days Crea|tion, the Sun, its known and undoubted Center, &s;eems the only proper Place for &s;uch a <HI>Chaos</HI> as were to be the common Source and Promptuary of
<PB N="40" REF="51">
the whole: But in the vulgar Account, where all the fix'd Stars and Planets of the Univer&s;e are to be &s;uppos'd at a Center together, we, who know not the Bounds and Circumference of the World, cannot be &s;uppos'd able to pitch upon a Center proper for &s;o immen&s;e and &s;trange a <HI>Chaos</HI>. Only one may venture to &s;ay, that the Earth, a &s;mall moveable Planet, revolving about the Sun, is an ill-cho&s;en one however.</P>
<P>And now upon a Recollection and View of this whole Argument, I do not que&s;tion but an un|prejudic'd Per&s;on, who knew nothing of the Sentiments of Commentators, or of the Opinions of the Vulgar; and who had only been conver|&s;ant in the Works and Word of God, the Book of External Nature, and the Book of Scripture, would ea&s;ily find the Bounds of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation; and on a little Con&s;ideration and Com|pari&s;on of the Sacred and Prophane Accounts of the Primitive <HI>Chaos</HI>, with the pre&s;ent Nature and Situation of the Heavenly Bodies, would quick|ly be convinc'd that our Earth alone were there|in concern'd; he could &s;carce be &s;uppos'd once to dream that the Origin of the Sun and Planets, much le&s;s of innumerable Suns and Planets, and of the entire Univer&s;e, was there accounted for. Such Notions, how general &s;oever, are not the Re&s;ult of Nature and Scripture carefully con&s;i|der'd and compar'd one with another, but the Effects of Ignorance of the Frame of the World, and of the Stile of Scripture; of an Unacquaint|edne&s;s with the <HI>Works</HI>, and thence an Inability of judging concerning the <HI>Word of God</HI> relating to them; or indeed commonly of a certain <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or Narrowne&s;s of Soul, which Temper, Education, Conver&s;ation, Application to &s;ome particular Studies and Authors, with a Strange|ne&s;s

In &s;hort, 'tis becau&s;e Men are not able to give them&s;elves or others a &s;atisfactory Account of &s;uch things, that they are forced to fall into a beaten Path, and content them&s;elves with tho&s;e poor and je|june Schemes, which, when carefully examin'd, prove neither Rational nor Scriptural, but are as perfectly contradictory to &s;ound Philo&s;ophy, as they are to the genuine Sen&s;e of tho&s;e very Texts on which they build their Conclu&s;ions. Every unbia&s;s'd Mind would ea&s;ily allow, that like Effects had like Cau&s;es; and that the Bodies of the &s;ame general Nature, U&s;es, and Motions, were to be deriv'd from the &s;ame Originals; and con&s;equently, that the Sun and the fixed Stars had <HI>one</HI>, as the Earth, and the other Planets <HI>ano|ther</HI> Sort of Formation. If therefore any free Con&s;iderer found that one of the latter Sort, that Planet which we inhabit, was deriv'd from a <HI>Chaos</HI>; by a Parity of Rea&s;on he would &s;uppo&s;e, every one of the other to be &s;o deriv'd al&s;o; I mean each from its particular <HI>Chaos</HI>.</P>
<P>Nay, truly, I might carry this Matter &s;till higher, and if one Planet mu&s;t be made Parent to ano|ther, ju&s;tly claim the principal Place for <HI>Jupiter</HI>, probably above 200 times as big as our Earth, and the large&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable of all the Sun's <HI>Chorus</HI>; and &s;o with greater Shew of Pro|bability a&s;&s;ert, that from its <HI>Chaos</HI> any of the other Planets were deriv'd, than it &s;elf from theirs. Particularly the Earth is &s;o &s;mall a Globe, that in Point of Dignity or Origination, very many of the Cele&s;tial Bodies may mo&s;t fairly claim the Precedence of it, and curb its a&s;piring Pre|ten&s;ions to any &s;uch mighty Prerogatives above its Fellows.

for any &s;uch childi&s;h Rea&s;oning on either Side; and every one of the Planets (e&s;pecially the Moon, &s;o exactly re&s;embling her Si&s;ter Earth) ought to be deduc'd from a di&s;tinct <HI>Chaos</HI> of its own, as well as that particular one which Pro|vidence has allotted for the Seat of Mankind.

<P>In order to the <HI>Reader's</HI> perceiving and admit|ting the Force of this, and &s;ome following Ar|guments, I mu&s;t premi&s;e &s;ome things touching the Nature of &s;uch Rea&s;onings, and how far they may be made u&s;e of without any ju&s;t Imputation of Boldne&s;s, Irreverence, or pre&s;umptuous Stint|ing and Determining the Divine Actions.</P>
<P>And here I freely confe&s;s, That 'tis not ne|ce&s;&s;ary in all Ca&s;es that we &s;hould comprehend the Rea&s;ons of the Divine Actions or Providence before we can be under an Obligation to believe them. They may be hid from us on &s;everal Ac|counts, tho' the things them&s;elves be plain in Scripture. Under which Circum&s;tances, I hear|tily own the &s;tricte&s;t Obligation to yield our un|feigned A&s;&s;ent to what God has clearly reveal'd, notwith&s;tanding we cannot &s;ee the entire Account|ablene&s;s thereof to our imperfect Under&s;tandings. But then, 'tis one thing to be <HI>above</HI>, and ano|ther to be <HI>repugnant</HI> to our Rea&s;on; 'tis one thing to be <HI>beyond</HI> the Comprehen&s;ion of, and another directly <HI>contradictory</HI> to our Human Faculties. Be&s;ides, the Clearne&s;s or Ob&s;curity of the Reve|lation is here very con&s;iderable: The former Ca&s;e re&s;olves our A&s;&s;ent into the Divine Veracity; but the latter may only be the Mi&s;takes of Human Deductions; and by Con&s;equence, tho' our fal|lible Rea&s;onings be &s;uper&s;eded by the fir&s;t, yet there is room for them in the &s;econd. I believe, for In&s;tance, and am oblig'd &s;o to do, that our Saviour Chri&s;t is truly <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, God and Man, becau&s;e I find it every where plain and
<PB N="44" REF="55">
evident that the Stile, Titles, Attributes, Acti|ons a&s;crib'd to the Son through the whole Bible, and all Chri&s;tian Antiquity, demon&s;trate him to be the very next Being to the Supreme God, and quite &s;uperior to all &s;ubordinate Creatures; or to be <HI>God the Word</HI> who was incarnate for the Salvation of Men; tho' it may be I am not able to give a clear Account of every thing relating to his Per&s;on or Incarnation. But I do not think my &s;elf equally oblig'd to believe the Doctrine of ab&s;olute and uncondition'd Reprobation, be|cau&s;e the Proofs alledg'd for it are far from being clear, and becau&s;e 'tis not &s;o properly <HI>above</HI>, as <HI>con|tradictory</HI> to the mo&s;t evident Rea&s;on. And this comes neare&s;t to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; in which, nei|ther can any one ju&s;tly a&s;&s;ert the Plainne&s;s of the Revelation on the Side of the common Scheme, nor alledge the Sublimity of the Subject, on account whereof it might be fairly &s;uppos'd above the Reach of our finite Capacities. The Scripture, as I take it, is evidently for, at lea&s;t mu&s;t be own'd not evidently again&s;t this re&s;trained Sen&s;e of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory before us; and the Sub|ject it &s;elf is finite and limited, and &s;o within our ken, and capable of our Comprehen&s;ion: On which Accounts &s;uch Arguments as follow ought to have their place, and if con&s;iderable, their Force and Influence on our Faith al&s;o, and go a great way to determine &s;uch a Di&s;pute as we are now upon.</P>
<P>And 'tis &s;ure not impo&s;&s;ible, within certain Bounds, for a con&s;idering Man to determine what is rational, wi&s;e and prudent; what is con|&s;onant to the Nature of things; what is &s;uitable to Foreca&s;t and Contrivance; what is, in mo&s;t Ca|&s;es, proper, decent and becoming, even with re|lation to the Divine Operations in the World.

We naturally, in the reflecting on the Sy&s;tem of External Nature, ob&s;erve many Marks and To|kens of the Wi&s;dom and Art, the Skill and Ar|tifice of the Great Creator; which &s;uppo&s;es that we are in good mea&s;ure competent Judges in &s;uch Matters. And indeed, 'tis but changing the Scene, and con&s;idering what we naturally pronounce to be rational and orderly, fit and proportionable among Men; what will become a wi&s;e General or State&s;man, a skilful Builder and Architect, nay, an ordinary Workman or Ar|tificer, in u&s;ual and obvious Ca&s;es: What on the one hand are the Tokens of Fore&s;ight and Prudence; and on the other, of Heedle&s;ne&s;s and Folly, in the common Affairs of Life; and we &s;hall not wholly be to &s;eek what to think of &s;e|veral analogous Actions relating to God him&s;elf: Due Allowance being every where made for that infinite Di&s;tance, and different State and Manage|ment of the Supreme Governor of the World, from tho&s;e of all finite Beings, depending on, and &s;ubject to him. Thus we collect our Idea's of the Divine Attributes, by con&s;idering what is good, great, valued and e&s;teemed, lovely and venerable among Men, and a&s;cribing every &s;uch thing to the Divine Nature; who being the O|rigin of them all, mu&s;t contain 'em within him|&s;elf in a higher and more eminent manner. By accumulating all Things that appear Perfections in Men, or other Creatures, and removing all Imperfections nece&s;&s;arily adhering to them, we arrive at the Notion of an Infinitely Perfect Be|ing; which is but another Name for <HI>God</HI>; and whom, on that account, we ju&s;tly think the pro|per Object of our Wor&s;hip and Adoration.</P>
<P>Since therefore our very Ideas of the Divine Properties are owing to, and depend on, our Con|&s;ideration
<PB N="46" REF="57">
of tho&s;e le&s;&s;er degrees of the &s;ame which we ob&s;erve in Men; and &s;ince the Rea&s;on why the contrary Properties are not by us a&s;cri|bed to him, is, becau&s;e we find that in Men they argue Imperfection: What is a Sign or Effect of &s;ome degree of Perfection in Men, mu&s;t al&s;o be acknowledg'd a Sign or Effect of a like Perfection in God. And what is a Sign or Effect of Imper|fection in Men, mu&s;t al&s;o be own'd, if it were &s;uppo&s;able, a Sign or Effect of a like Imperfection in God. Thus, for in&s;tance, we certainly gather, that God cannot be properly pleas'd or delighted in the Mi&s;ery and Torment of his Creatures, where yet the Ju&s;tice and Wi&s;dom of his Government may require him &s;everely to puni&s;h 'em; Becau&s;e we cannot but e&s;teem it an odious Vice, and ba&s;e Imperfection in a Judge on Earth, in like Ca&s;es, to be &s;o affected; and whether we will or no, we look upon it as an In&s;tance of Cruelty and Barbarity of Di&s;po&s;ition to reli&s;h and ta&s;te a Sweetne&s;s, in the Cries and Groans of condemned and dying Malefactors. In like manner we ju&s;tly conclude, God cannot <HI>Impo&s;e</HI> on Innocent Crea|tures, no not by &s;uch Wiles, Stratagems, or other Methods of Collu&s;ion, wherein yet direct and downright Fal&s;hood were avoided; becau&s;e we find a &s;pontaneous Aver&s;ion and Indignation ari&s;es in our Minds, when &s;uch Tricks and Shams are di&s;cover'd among Men. And by the &s;ame way, and equal Force of rea&s;oning, we may collect, that God cannot, in the Formation or Di&s;po&s;ition of Things, no more than in other Ca&s;es, act ab|&s;urdly or di&s;agreeably to Rea&s;on; di&s;proportio|nately or un&s;uitably to the Nature of Things; immethodically without Rule and Order, or fool|i&s;hly without Drift and De&s;ign, according as an impartial and con&s;idering Man, who were duly

acquainted with the Sy&s;tem of Nature, would judge and determine in the Ca&s;e.

to give a compleat and full Account of &s;ome large and &s;pacious Country, with the ma|ny Noble Kingdoms, Principalities, Lord&s;hips, and Governments therein contain'd; and upon Peru&s;al, nothing was to be found mention'd in any particular manner, but a certain little and remote I&s;land (&s;o incon&s;iderable, that the Generality of the Inhabitants of the Main Land never heard &s;o much as its Name) which indeed was de&s;crib'd carefully, and its &s;everal Circum&s;tances diligently accounted for; but as to the re&s;t, there appear'd no more than at the Conclu&s;ion of a Chapter, two or three Names of its principal Divi&s;ions, and &s;ome Advantages which one or two of their Ma|ritime Towns afforded this &s;mall I&s;land, and then all was concluded. Now he that &s;hould take this for a ju&s;t and adequate Hi&s;tory of the whole, and earne&s;tly contend for the Compleatne&s;s and Per|fection of the Work, would be certainly taken for a <HI>&s;trange</HI> Per&s;on; or rather would be thought in Je&s;t, and to de&s;ign the real Expo&s;ing of the Folly and Ridiculou&s;ne&s;s of the Publi&s;her there|of. The&s;e familiar In&s;tances among&s;t Men, &s;hew what <HI>unbrib'd</HI> and <HI>untainted</HI> Nature in&s;tantaneou&s;ly pronounces in &s;uch Ca&s;es; and thereby direct us what we ought to judge in parallel ones, in which God him&s;elf is directly intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>Where the Change of the Per&s;on is &s;o far from altering, that it exceedingly confirms the&s;e Dictates of Right Rea&s;on, and makes tho&s;e Suppo&s;itions which were <HI>har&s;h</HI> and <HI>incredible</HI> with regard to Men, to become <HI>intolerable</HI> and <HI>impious</HI> when apply'd to the Deity. What&s;oever bears the Cha|racters of Truth, Ju&s;tice, Order, Wi&s;dom, and Contrivance, which I cannot but expect from good and skilful Men; I undoubtedly require and believe of the Divine Maje&s;ty without the lea&s;t
<PB N="49" REF="60">
He&s;itation, in the highe&s;t Degree and &s;upreme&s;t Mea&s;ure imaginable. But what&s;oever looks like Fal&s;ene&s;s, Inju&s;tice, Confu&s;ion, Folly, and a wild Di&s;proportion or Precipitancy among Men, and which I am difficultly induc'd to imagine of frail and imperfect Creatures like my &s;elf, I am much more hardly per&s;uaded, or rather find it impo&s;&s;ible to believe of God. Tho&s;e very Fa|culties, by which I am enabled to di&s;tingui&s;h and pa&s;s a Sentence in the&s;e Matters, are deriv'd from God, and Part of the Divine Image on the Soul of Man; and &s;hall I &s;o oddly make u&s;e of them, that what I could not be brought to cre|dit of any one of my Neighbours, it were &s;o uncouth, ab&s;urd, and prepo&s;terous, I freely ad|mit and contend for when a&s;crib'd to my Crea|tor? The Mind of Man, if it have leave to re|flect freely, can no more acquie&s;ce in any Scheme of the Works of God, where nothing of Fore|ca&s;t, Order, <HI>Decorum</HI>, and Wi&s;dom is con&s;picu|ous; where every Period appears puzzling, im|methodical, di&s;proportionate, and ill-di&s;pos'd, (and &s;uch is that of the vulgar Idea of the <HI>Mo|&s;aick</HI> Creation, as will be prov'd pre&s;ently) than it can believe Contradictions; or that God is an infinitely wi&s;e and perfect Being indeed, but yet at the &s;ame time acting what, in the common Sen&s;e of Mankind, argues the greate&s;t Folly and Imperfection; which entirely and with plenary Satisfaction to do, is certainly impo&s;&s;ible. There is &s;omewhat in the Human Soul that has too quick a Sen&s;e of the Decency and Fitne&s;s of things, and withal too deep a Veneration for the adora|ble Maje&s;ty of God, to be <HI>ea&s;y under</HI>, though it may be <HI>overborn with</HI> &s;uch Notions. It cannot be willing to believe <HI>that</HI> of it Wi&s;e and Glorious Creator, which for another to believe of it
<PB N="50" REF="61">
&s;elf would be e&s;teem'd as an high Indignity.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there is &s;o great a Difference be|tween the Compa&s;s of the Divine, and the Straitne&s;s of Human Knowledge; between the State of Creatures and of the <HI>Creator, Ble&s;&s;ed for evermore</HI>; there may be &s;uch an Incapaci|ty in us to reach, or unfathomable, yet wi&s;e Rea&s;ons for God to hide &s;ome things from us; not to in&s;i&s;t on the Divine Prerogative, which frees him from the Obligation of giving an Ac|count of every thing to any of tho&s;e Beings he has made; that we ought to be very wary of ar|guing from Man to God, without due Allowance for the&s;e Con&s;iderations; and con&s;equently, migh|ty cautious of affirming or denying whatever is a&s;crib'd to him from &s;uch a Compari&s;on. In par|ticular, where-ever a clear Revelation interpo&s;es, we are bound to quit our fallible Rea&s;onings, and fully to acquie&s;ce in &s;uch a Deci&s;ion: It be|ing impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>God</HI> to <HI>Lye</HI>, but by no means &s;o, that <HI>we</HI> may <HI>be mi&s;taken</HI>.</P>
<P>But then this nece&s;&s;ary Prudence and Warine&s;s is chiefly, if not only, concern'd in &s;ublime and my&s;terious Points; concerning the incomprehen|&s;ible Nature, or un&s;earchable Providences of God; which Doctrines are &s;ometimes &s;o much above the pre&s;ent Scene of Things; &s;o remote from the Notions and Affairs of this World; relate to and depend upon &s;uch other Sy&s;tems of Beings or Circum&s;tances of the Invi&s;ible World; that we ought not ra&s;hly to pa&s;s our Judgment on them; but wait till our Souls become &s;o improv'd, and our Under&s;tandings. &s;o enlightened in a future State; till our Means of Information, and Oppor|tunities of looking through the whole Chain and Sy&s;tem, be &s;o many more than now they are, that we may ju&s;tly be &s;uppos'd more <HI>competent Judges</HI>,
<PB N="51" REF="62">
and <HI>equal Arbitrators</HI>, than at pre&s;ent the Imper|fection of our Condition will permit us in Rea|&s;on to pretend to.</P>
<P>But this being again precaution'd, to prevent any Mi&s;con&s;truction or Abu&s;e of this Rea&s;oning, I cannot but &s;ay, that &s;ince 'twill be hard to prove the Ca&s;e before us to be of &s;o exalted a Na|ture as to tran&s;cend our Faculties; and perhaps &s;till harder to prove the Plainne&s;s of the Revela|tion on the Side of the common Expo&s;ition, I am fully per&s;uaded, that while the Perfections of God are, as to our A&s;&s;ent, deduc'd from their Effects, they may in good Mea&s;ure, within certain Bounds, as was before di&s;cours'd, be judg'd of by what is ob&s;ervable among Men. And as what&s;oever is worthy, good, and valuable among our &s;elves, is rightly own'd as an Efflux and Gift of God; &s;o what&s;oever is prepo&s;terous, ab&s;urd, or di&s;orderly, what&s;oever is unworthy, ba&s;e, or de&s;picable in human Affairs, cannot without great Indignity be believed of him; and where we have no other Ways of determining, &s;uch Rea&s;onings ought to be per&s;ua&s;ive and decretory.</P>
<P>Now therefore, all this being &s;aid by Way of Introduction to this, and &s;ome following Argu|ments, let us apply it to the Ca&s;e before us; and &s;uppo&s;ing, (which yet I need not allow) that the Matter were indifferent on all other Con&s;iderati|ons, let us &s;peak freely whether &s;uch a Method, &s;uch Time, and &s;uch Proportion of the &s;everal Parts as the ordinary Scheme of the Creation &s;ets before us, be in any Degree &s;o well contriv'd, and &s;uitably di&s;pos'd, as I &s;ay not a Divine, but a mere Human Architect may be &s;uppos'd the Author of. I need not here give a particular Ac|count of the vulgar Expo&s;ition of the fir&s;t Chap|ter of <HI>Gene&s;is:</HI> 'Tis &s;ufficiently known as to the
<PB N="52" REF="63">
main Parts of it. But the Di&s;proportions I would take notice of in it under this Head are the&s;e Three:</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The <HI>Length of the Day</HI> u&s;ually a&s;&s;ign'd, is wholly <HI>di&s;proportionate</HI> to the Bu&s;ine&s;s done upon it.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) While the Works of each of the other Days are <HI>&s;ingle, di&s;tinct, and of a Sort</HI>, the Third Day has two <HI>quite different</HI>, nay, almo&s;t <HI>incom|patible</HI> Works a&s;&s;igned to it.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) And principally, The Earth with its Fur|niture, how incon&s;iderable a Body &s;oever it be, takes up <HI>four entire Days</HI>, at lea&s;t, of tho&s;e <HI>&s;ix</HI> which were allotted to the whole Creation; whil&s;t the Sun, Moon and Stars, tho&s;e va&s;tly greater and more con&s;iderable Bodies, are crowd|ed into <HI>one &s;ingle Day</HI> together.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The Length of the Day u&s;ually a&s;&s;ign'd of Twenty four Hours is wholly di&s;proportionate to the Bu&s;ine&s;s done upon it. This plainly ap|pears by the Hi&s;tory it &s;elf; where, to omit other In&s;tances, the whole Train in the Genera|tion or fir&s;t Production of Animals, has no longer a Space afforded to it; when yet all Experience &s;hews, that a much longer is nece&s;&s;arily requir'd, and has obtain'd in all the &s;ub&s;equent Ages. Now I do not que&s;tion but it will be confe&s;s'd by all, that according to the con&s;tant Proce&s;s of Nature, this Time is utterly in&s;ufficient for this Purpo&s;e: But what will be &s;aid is, that a Divine Power immediately interpos'd, and either form'd every Thing in its grown and mature State; or at lea&s;t accelerated and ha&s;ten'd the Cour&s;e of Nature, &s;o as to enable her to perfect each Crea|ture in &s;o &s;hort a Space; and that con&s;equently, no Straitne&s;s of Time ought to be alleg'd on this Account. In an&s;wer whereto I freely grant, that God <HI>can</HI> produce all Things in their mo&s;t
<PB N="53" REF="64">
perfect State, in a Moment; and if that could be prov'd to have been the Method here, this Ex|ception were of no Validity. But as on &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition 'tis &s;trange that <HI>&s;ix entire and &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive Days</HI> &s;hould be requi&s;ite to, or pitch'd upon by an infinite and unlimited Agent, when the <HI>in&s;tantaneous Creation</HI> of the whole appears in this Ca&s;e more agreeable to the Dignity and Power of the Creator; &s;o I am pretty &s;ecure that this Hypothe&s;is, how common &s;oever, is repug|nant to the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory. The Sacred Pen|man does there a&s;cribe indeed the Origin of every Thing to the Divine Power; yet no otherwi&s;e than the like would be, and is done by the Holy Writers afterwards, nay, by every body at this Day; when yet the con&s;tant Method of Genera|tion is exactly ob&s;erv'd. If any of us were ask'd, Who made us? We &s;hould &s;oon an&s;wer, God; without the lea&s;t Imagination that we were excu|&s;ed from that nine Month's Abode, and gradual Growth in our Mother's Womb; which every one by the general Rule and Method of Nature is ob|lig'd to undergo. Which appears in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e to be the Intention of the Holy Writer, be|cau&s;e he makes the&s;e very Animals Productions of the Water and Earth, as well as the proper Effects of the Divine Power;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.20, 21, 24.</NOTE> as hath been ob&s;erv'd al|ready on another Occa&s;ion. And tho&s;e who deny this gradual Generation according to the Cour&s;e of Nature, mu&s;t, without Rea&s;on, recede from the Letter of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>, and all the old Traditions of the Heathen Philo&s;ophers, and that when by &s;o do|ing they render this Sacred Hi&s;tory more difficult and unintelligible than it really is.</P>
<P>But if in&s;tead of <HI>Immediate Creation</HI>, it be &s;aid that 'twas only a <HI>&s;upernatural Acceleration</HI> of na|tural Cau&s;es, without any other Alteration of the
<PB N="54" REF="65">
Proce&s;s; which is I think the only probable Eva|&s;ion, and the faire&s;t Suppo&s;ition of all other; I reply, That this is <HI>gratis dictum</HI>, without any Foundation in the Scripture, and &s;o as ea&s;ily de|nied as a&s;&s;erted; it is introduc'd only to &s;alve the Shortne&s;s of Time mention'd in the Hi&s;tory, which will be prov'd hereafter to &s;tand in no Need of it; and it overthrows all Attempts of accounting for this &s;ix Days Creation in a rational and natural Way; for if a miraculous Power be allow'd in a needle&s;s Ca&s;e, we &s;hall be ever at a lo&s;s how far to extend it, and where mechanical Cau&s;es ought to take place. On which Con&s;iderations I take this extraordinary Acceleration of natural Cau&s;es to be, tho' not impo&s;&s;ible, nor (were there any Intimation or Nece&s;&s;ity of its Interpo&s;ition from the Sacred Hi&s;tory) very improbable nei|ther, yet in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, groundle&s;s, unne|ce&s;&s;ary, perplexing of the Cau&s;e, and by no means a &s;ufficient Solution in the pre&s;ent Affair. Which being therefore thus an&s;wer'd, the Argument re|mains in full Force, and the Length of the Days a&s;&s;ign'd by the vulgar Hypothe&s;is appears wholly di&s;proportionate to the Works done therein; of which farther Notice will be taken hereafter.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) When the Works of each of the other Days are <HI>&s;ingle, di&s;tinct, and of a Sort</HI>, the third Day has two <HI>quite different, nay, incompatible</HI> ones a&s;&s;igned to it. This is plain from the Hi&s;tory, where the Divi&s;ion of the Waters from the Earth, or the Di&s;tinction of the Terraqueous Globe into Seas and dry Land, the fir&s;t Work on this Day, is &s;ucceeded by that of the Production of the en|tire vegetable Kingdom; contrary to the per|petual Tenor of the other Periods of the Crea|tion. How this comes about, or is accountable in the vulgar Scheme, I know not; and I believe
<PB N="55" REF="66">
the Rea&s;on thereof is very little enquir'd into, and le&s;s under&s;tood. But becau&s;e this whole Difficulty will be urg'd again&s;t the Shortne&s;s of Days in the vulgar Hypothe&s;is, and clear'd in ours, at their proper Places hereafter, I &s;hall wave the farther in&s;i&s;ting on it here, and proceed.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) But principally, The Earth with its Furni|ture, how incon&s;iderable a Body &s;oever it is, takes up <HI>four entire days</HI>, at lea&s;t, of tho&s;e <HI>&s;ix</HI> which were allotted to the whole Creation; while the Sun, Moon and Stars, tho&s;e va&s;tly greater and more con&s;iderable Bodies, are crowded into <HI>one &s;ingle day</HI> together. Now in order to our pa&s;&s;ing a rational Judgment in this Matter, I &s;hall take leave to repre&s;ent to the Reader's View a &s;hort Compari&s;on or Parallel between the Earth on one Side, and the re&s;t of the World on the other; and &s;ee what Re&s;emblance, Corre&s;pondence and Pro|portion there is between the former and the latter, either in its &s;everal Parts, or the whole taken to|gether; and this &s;hall be done on &s;uch certain and undoubted Grounds and Principles as the late va&s;t Advancement of natural Knowledge has af|forded us; and will be more at large explain'd in the following Pages.</P>
<P>This Earth then, on which we live, though it be in Diameter not much le&s;s than 8000 Miles, and &s;o a va&s;t Globe, if compar'd with tho&s;e Bo|dies we daily &s;ee, imagine, and conver&s;e withal; is yet one of the le&s;&s;er of the primary Planets, and with <HI>Jupiter, Mars</HI>, and the other her Fellows, revolves round the great Center of our Sy&s;tem the <HI>Sun</HI>, in a Year's time. 'Tis an opake and dark Body, as they all are; and in common with them borrows all its Light and Heat from that glo|rious Body which we ju&s;t now ob&s;erv'd to obtain the Center of their Orbits; without which it, as
<PB N="56" REF="67">
well as the entire Chorus of the other Planets, mu&s;t be &s;oon reduc'd all to one dark Heap of Matter, far beyond the De&s;cription of the old ca|liginous and unprofitable <HI>Chaos</HI>, and in no Capaci|ty of ever emerging out of that horrid and fright|ful State. In Dignity, if our Earth expect not to come the <HI>la&s;t</HI>, yet is &s;he &s;o exceeded, in all things that might &s;eem Characters thereof, by &s;everal of the re&s;t, that there can be no manner of Claim to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place. If &s;he have a &s;econdary Planet, the <HI>Moon</HI>, for her Attendant; (tho' in truth &s;he is at lea&s;t as &s;erviceable to that Planet, as that Planet is to her;) <HI>Jupiter</HI> has certainly four; and our be&s;t Gla&s;&s;es have di&s;cover'd five about <HI>Saturn</HI>. The Den&s;ity and Place of the Earth is pretty near the Middle of the Planets; and as &s;he exceeds, and is higher than &s;ome, &s;o is &s;he exceeded by, and lower than others in tho&s;e re&s;pects. Her own &s;econdary Planet, the <HI>Moon</HI>, has an Air much more homogeneous, pure, and tran&s;parent, than &s;he at pre&s;ent enjoys; and in all probability free from Winds, Clouds, Storms, Tempe&s;ts, Thunder, Lightning, and &s;uch other irregular and pernicious Effects, which frequently render our Atmo&s;phere &s;o contagious and pe&s;tilent to the Inhabitants of the Earth. In which Cir|cum&s;tances the Generality of the other Planets imitate the Moon, and render our mi&s;erable Con|dition the more remarkable and &s;en&s;ible, as ap|pearing thereby almo&s;t &s;ingular. Our Days and Nights are longer than tho&s;e of &s;ome, and &s;horter than tho&s;e of others of the Planets. The Figure of the Earth is nearly &s;pherical, as is that al&s;o of the other Heavenly Bodies; its Surface unequal, with Mountains and Valleys, as well as that of the re&s;t, e&s;pecially the Moon's, appears to be. Only 'tis ob|&s;ervable, that the la&s;t, tho' much le&s;s in Bigne&s;s, has
<PB N="57" REF="68">
her Mountains higher than tho&s;e on the Earth. The Sea and Land, Mountains and Valleys, and other &s;uch corre&s;ponding <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Moon, &s;hew, that that &s;mall Planet is not nearer our Earth in Place, than in Quality and Di&s;po&s;ition al&s;o. If we compute the true Magnitude or Quantity of Mat|ter in the Earth, it will appear upon a moderate E|&s;timate, that &s;he is not the 200th Part &s;o big as <HI>Ju|piter</HI>, nor the 90th &s;o big as <HI>Saturn</HI>, nor the 220,000th &s;o big as the Sun. So that &s;he is very incon&s;ide|rable, if compar'd with the re&s;t of <HI>Solar Sy&s;tem</HI> on|ly; but if with the entire Univer&s;e, or Sy&s;tems of the fix'd Stars, in the Elegancy of the Pro|phetick Expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>as a drop of a Bucket,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;a. xl.15, 17.</NOTE> <HI>as the &s;mall du&s;t of the Balance, yea le&s;s than nothing, and vanity</HI>. In&s;omuch, that to all tho&s;e remote Sy&s;tems of the Heavenly Bodies, this Earth, with all its Fellow-Planets, are no more vi&s;ible than tho&s;e which, 'tis probable, revolve about any of them, are to us in the&s;e our Planetary Regions. And as we u&s;ually little think of tho&s;e invi&s;ible Globes, &s;o any of their Inhabitants, if &s;uch there be, never perhaps once imagine that there is &s;uch a Planet as ours, (about which we make &s;uch a mighty &s;tir) in the World. As to the main U&s;e of this Earth, 'tis to afford Habitation to a &s;inful and lap&s;ed Race of Creatures, of &s;mall Abilities or Capa|cities at pre&s;ent, but of great Vices and Wicked|ne&s;s; and is e&s;teemed, as far as appears, in its pre|&s;ent Con&s;titution &s;o peculiarly and &s;olely fit for them, that when they are gone, or their Di&s;po|&s;itions and Faculties reform'd and improv'd, a bet|ter Scene of Nature, (<HI>a new Heaven</HI>, and <HI>a new Earth</HI>) is to be introduc'd, for &s;uch better and more noble Creatures. The old one, which now obtains, being in its pre&s;ent State, it &s;eems, only a Sort of Pri&s;on or Confinement, which is to be
<PB N="58" REF="69">
our Lot whil&s;t we are &s;inful and mi&s;erable, but no longer.</P>
<P>And is this the only Darling of Nature, the prime Object of the Creation and Providence of God? Can &s;uch a Globe's Original, nay, of the ex|ternal and vi&s;ible Parts of it only, claim four Parts of &s;ix of that entire Space, which the Wi&s;dom of God allotted for the Formation of all things in the whole World? while the Origin of the Sun, Moon, and numberle&s;s Sy&s;tems of Stars has only a poor &s;ingle Part allotted to it? Mu&s;t the expanding the Air be|tween the Earth and the Clouds, be thought to equal the Di&s;po&s;al of all tho&s;e Cele&s;tial Bodies into their &s;everal Regions? and the producing a few Fi&s;h and Fowl be a weightier Concern, and require more time than the repleni&s;hing all the other habitable Worlds with Beings &s;uitable to their &s;everal Con|&s;titutions? Will a wife Builder be&s;tow twice as much time in decking and adorning one By-clo&s;et of inferior U&s;e, and that only to &s;ome of the mean|e&s;t Servants too; as of the Royal Palace, with all its &s;tately Rooms and Apartments, intended for the King him&s;elf, and his Courtiers? Should we hear of &s;uch &s;trange Actions, and di&s;proportionate Pro|cedure among Men, we &s;hould not be able to in|duce our &s;elves to give credit thereto. But it &s;eems Suppo&s;itions ten thou&s;and times more di&s;proportio|nate and unaccountable, when a&s;crib'd to God Al|mighty, are ea&s;ily believ'd. So far can Ignorance, Prejudice, and a Mi&s;under&s;tanding of the Sacred Volumes carry the <HI>Faith</HI>, nay, the <HI>Zeal</HI> of Men! and to &s;uch a mean Opinion of the mo&s;t glorious and perfect of Beings are we thereby reduc'd, that, as if we were not content to think him &s;uch a one as our &s;elves, but intended to depre&s;s him below the very meane&s;t of us, we venture with Confidence and Eagerne&s;s to a&s;cribe to him that di&s;proportio|nate,
<PB N="59" REF="70">
unequal, and unaccountable Di&s;po&s;al of the Works of Creation, which the &s;imple&s;t Artificer could not bear the Imputation of!</P>
<P>It may here indeed be alleg'd, that the Earth mu&s;t be of all the re&s;t the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, be|cau&s;e to its Inhabitants <HI>alone</HI> belong'd that &s;tupen|dous and unparallel'd Method of Divine Provi|dence, I mean the Incarnation of the Only-be|gotten Son of God. Now in An&s;wer to this, I &s;ay, (1.) 'Tis not <HI>&s;o certain</HI> that the Son of God was <HI>a|lone</HI> concern'd with the Inhabitants of this Earth in the mighty de&s;ign of his Incarnation and Mediation. St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. i.10.</NOTE> <HI>That in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times, he might gather together in one all things in Chri&s;t, both which are in Heaven, and which are on Earth, even in him</HI>. And again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colo&s;. i.19, 20.</NOTE> <HI>It plea&s;ed the Father that in him &s;hould all fulne&s;s dwell: And (ha|ving made peace thro' the blood of his cro&s;s) by him to reconcile all things unto him&s;elf; by him, I &s;ay, whether they be things on Earth or things in Heaven</HI>. I &s;ay, (2.) That tho' the Advantages of our Saviour's Incarnation and Mediation, &s;hould be wholly con|fin'd to the Inhabitants of this Earth, that does not &s;hew that the other Parts of God's Creation are not equally regarded by him: but only that the <HI>peculiar Circum&s;tances</HI> of that fallen Race of Crea|tures which belong'd to this Earth, and of that a|lone, did require &s;o wonderful a Method of Recove|ry as that by the Only-begotten Son of God in our Fle&s;h. If a King &s;hould &s;end his Elde&s;t Son into a particular Province to quiet a Rebellion, and u&s;e peculiar Means to reduce that Province to its an|cient Obedience, and into no other Part of his Kingdom; this would only prove that the Circum|&s;tances of that Province, and of that only, requir'd &s;o extraordinary a Treatment; and not that the King had a le&s;s Care and Concern for tho&s;e other
<PB N="60" REF="71">
Provinces which were all along obedient to him.

<P>It mu&s;t here be confe&s;s'd, That &s;uch Notions of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation, as I now oppo&s;e, having be|gun, or at lea&s;t been chiefly e&s;tabli&s;hed and pro|pagated when the <HI>Ari&s;totelean</HI> Philo&s;ophy, and <HI>Pto|lemaick</HI> A&s;tronomy were believ'd; tho&s;e who have embrac'd them till this Age were le&s;s ab&s;urd, and nearer to &s;ome tolerable degree of probability. For &s;o long as the Earth, with its adjoining Ele|ments, was &s;uppos'd the Center and Ba&s;is of all the World; while the Di&s;tance of the Heavenly Bodies was believ'd to be, comparatively to what we now find, very &s;mall and incon&s;iderable; and all their Motions perform'd about us their proper and immo|vable Center; while the whole Series of Spheres above (tho' the &s;everal di&s;tinct ones mov'd the con|trary way by their own peculiar Motions) was &s;up|pos'd in twenty four hours to be con&s;tantly hurry'd from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t</HI> by the <HI>Primum Mobile</HI>, on purpo&s;e to cau&s;e Day and Night to us below; while Comets were e&s;teem'd Exhalations from the Stars or our At|mo&s;phere, and &s;ent only at certain Sea&s;ons to affright Mankind with their fiery Tails, and then to be di&s;&s;i|pated and vani&s;h into Vapours again; while the Sun and Stars, in the Opinion of the Philo&s;ophers them|&s;elves, were nouri&s;h'd by Steams from our Earth; and while the la&s;t nam'd were either &s;uppos'd to be &s;tuck in one Spherical Superficies as the fix'd Stars, or fa&s;ten'd in their &s;olid Orbs, like a Nail in a Cart|wheel, as the Planets, and no other U&s;e imagin'd but to twinkle to us in Winter Evenings, and by

their A&s;pects to forebode what little Changes of Weather, or other Accidents were to be expected below; while no other habitable World was dream'd of than this Globe of Earth; no other Animals once conjectur'd at, be&s;ides tho&s;e on the Face thereof; while Mankind was look'd on as the &s;ole Lord of the Creation, and Him for who&s;e Sake all other Creatures in the World were made; and while 'twas commonly granted that, As all Things, the vi&s;ible Heavens and Earth, with their entire Furniture began with him; So at the Conclu&s;ion of his Succe&s;&s;ion, or the period of Human Generations here, mu&s;t they for ever cea&s;e and be annihilated; While all this, I &s;ay, was the current Philo&s;ophy, 'tis not very &s;ur|prizing that the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory we are now upon was under&s;tood in the Vulgar Sen&s;e, and &s;eem'd not wholly di&s;agreeable to the pre&s;umed Frame of Nature; and 'twas not hard to believe, that this Earth and its Inhabitants, in the gene|ral Opinion, the main and principal Concern of all, and that to who&s;e U&s;es every Thing el&s;e en|tirely &s;erv'd, had the principal Care be&s;tow'd up|on it, both in its original Creation, and its &s;ub|&s;equent Changes and Revolutions.</P>
<P>But tho' &s;uch a Scheme, and &s;uch an Appre|hen&s;ion were pa&s;&s;able enough in the Days of our Forefathers, 'tis by no means &s;o now. Tho&s;e greater degrees of Knowledge which the Provi|dence of God has in this Age afforded us, make &s;uch Opinions intolerable in the pre&s;ent, which were not &s;o in the pa&s;t Centuries. 'Tis now evi|dent, That every one of the Planets, as well as that on which we live, mu&s;t have a Right in its Proportion to &s;hare in the Care of Heaven, and had therefore in all Probability a &s;uitable Space or Number of Days allow'd to its proper Forma|tion;

<P>And let the <HI>Reader</HI> judge, if it be &s;o impo&s;&s;i|ble to reduce the Planets alone within the fourth Day's Work, how much more &s;o will it be (in ca&s;e we allow Degrees of Impo&s;&s;ibilities) to re|duce thither that va&s;t, noble, and u&s;eful Body, the Fountain of our Light and Heat, the Sun; and &s;till in a prodigious degree more &s;o, to in|clude the immen&s;e and numberle&s;s Sy&s;tems of the fix'd Stars; among whom when the Sun is but one, and perhaps no bigger than the re&s;t; (and con|&s;equently to have in Rea&s;on but an equal Portion of Time with them allotted for its Origination;) It mu&s;t, tho' probably above 220,000 times as big as the Earth, while the Earth takes up four <HI>entire</HI> ones, be thru&s;t into the <HI>Corner</HI> of a &s;ingle Day; <HI>Corner</HI>, did I &s;ay? rather <HI>Minute</HI>, nay, <HI>Moment of a Day</HI>; and 'tis uncertain whether even that Pittance of Time can fairly and &s;eparately be allow'd to it.

And can any one who is &s;en&s;ible of this, and entertains no other than great and worthy Thoughts of his All-wi&s;e Creator, embrace &s;o fond and &s;o &s;trange an Opinion?</P>
<P>And if the Reader will pardon a &s;hort Digre&s;|&s;ion, and give me leave to &s;peak a great Truth on this Occa&s;ion, I cannot but ob&s;erve, That 'tis not the genuine Contents of the Holy Books them|&s;elves, but &s;uch unwary Interpretations of them as the&s;e, which have mainly contributed to their Contempt, and been but too in&s;trumental to make 'em appear Ab&s;urd and Irrational to the Free Rea&s;on of Mankind. For when Men found that the Scriptures, according to the Univer&s;al Sen&s;e of Expo&s;itors, a&s;cribed &s;uch Things to God, as their plaine&s;t Rea&s;on could not think compatible to a wi&s;e Man, much le&s;s to the All-wi&s;e God; they were under a &s;hrewd Temptation of thinking very meanly of the Bible it &s;elf, and by degrees of rejecting it, and therewith all Divine Reve|lation to the Sons of Men. How fatally this Ma|lady hath &s;pread, of late e&s;pecially, I need not &s;ay; and tho' I fully believe the main Stroke or Step, as to the Generality, be Vicious Di&s;po&s;iti|ons, and a Debauched Temper; yet how far &s;uch Ill-contriv'd, Unskilful, Unphilo&s;ophical Inter|pretations, or rather Mi&s;repre&s;entations of Scri|pture, particularly tho&s;e relating to the Material World of which we are now &s;peaking, may have contributed to &s;o fatal and pernicious an Effect, de&s;erves the mo&s;t &s;erious and &s;ober Con&s;ideration.</P>

as tho&s;e here referr'd to, by patronizing the &s;ame with Divine Authority, and then making vehement Invectives again&s;t &s;uch (as many un|skilful, yet good Men are ready to do,) who&s;e on|ly Fault is this, that they can no more be induc'd to believe what is plainly unworthy of, and un&s;uit|able to the Divine Perfections, than what is evidently contradictory to Divine Revelation. Wi&s;e Men would rather &s;et them&s;elves carefully to compare Nature with Scripture, and make a free Enquiry into the certain <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the one, and the genuine Sen&s;e of the other; which if Expo&s;itors would do, 'twere not hard to de|mon&s;trate in &s;everal &s;uch Ca&s;es, that the latter is &s;o far from oppo&s;ing the Truths deducible from the former, or the common Notions of Mankind, that 'tis in the greate&s;t Harmony therewith; and in tho&s;e Ca&s;es (where the Thing mention'd is within the Sphere of Human Knowledge) no le&s;s account|able to the Rea&s;on, than enforc'd on the Belief of Mankind. And I per&s;uade my &s;elf, if there were a careful Collection made of the ancient Knots and Difficulties in the &s;everal Parts of the Bible, with relation to &s;uch Points as we are upon, or any others of a different Nature; and how very many of them, as Preludes and Pledges of the re&s;t, are now entirely clear'd, or might ea&s;ily be &s;o; it would more contribute to the Recovery of the ancient Honour, and due E&s;teem of the Sacred Scriptures, than all the mo&s;t zealous and general Harangues from &s;ome popular Topicks, either for them, or again&s;t their Contemners, the loo&s;e <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> and pretended <HI>Socinians</HI> of this Age. For my own Part, I cannot but profe&s;s, that tho' I be very nice and tender in the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of my Faith, and de&s;irous to admit nothing but what agrees to the Divine Attributes, the common No|tions

of our Souls, and the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature; yet upon an impartial Enquiry into &s;ome of the mo&s;t perplexing Difficulties occurring there, I have obtain'd &s;o great a Mea&s;ure of Satisfaction about them, that my Scruples now cea&s;e, and I cannot doubt either of the Truth or Divine Au|thority of the Scriptures. I do not mean, that all the Difficulties are in particular vani&s;h'd and per|fectly clear'd to me; that is what is &s;carce to be hoped for in this World: But I have &s;o frequent|ly met with fewer Difficulties in the Con&s;idera|tion of the Books them&s;elves, than in the com|mon Interpretations, and tho&s;e very Comments which ought to a&s;&s;oil 'em; and in &s;o many, and tho&s;e mo&s;t remarkable Points of all, have met with &s;uch clear and plenary, tho' unexpected Sa|tisfaction, that I have great Rea&s;on to believe the re&s;t equally capable of the &s;ame; and to remain con&s;tant in this A&s;&s;urance, that 'tis the ignorant or fooli&s;h Expo&s;itions of Men, not the $$tural and genuine Sen&s;e of the Words them&s;elves, that makes us imagine, Scripture, Rea&s;on, and the Nature of Things irreconcileable or contradictory to one another. And I hope the In&s;tances he will meet with in the following Theory, will go a great way to per&s;uade the unbia&s;s'd Reader of the &s;ame Truth; and to convince him, that greater Satisfaction is to be look'd for from the View of God's own Books of Nature and Scripture, than tho&s;e of any Men what&s;oever. Whatever incompetent Judges may &s;ay, nothing will &s;o much tend to the Vindication and Honour of reveal'd Religion, as free Enquiries into, and a &s;olid Acquaintance with, (not inge|nious and precarious Hypothe&s;es, but) true and demon&s;trable Principles of Philo&s;ophy, with the Hi&s;tory of Nature, and with &s;uch ancient Tra|ditions as in all Probability were deriv'd from

<P N="1">(1.) Bodies alike in Nature, have an unlike Original. Our Earth is one of the Planets, and in all Rea&s;on belonging to their Formation; yet is &s;he the Subject of the Second, Third, Fifth, and Sixth Days Works, while the re&s;t are inclu|ded in the Fourth Day.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Bodies unlike in Nature have a like Original. The Sun, a glorious Body of Light,
<PB N="68" REF="79">
with his Fellows the fix'd Stars, are join'd in the fourth Day with the Opake and dark Globes the Planets.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Bodies mo&s;t con&s;iderable in them&s;elves, have the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable Accounts given of them. This is very obvious in that mighty ado about our poor Earth, while the va&s;tly greater and nobler Bodies of the Sun and Stars are &s;carce taken any notice of. And how di&s;proportionate &s;uch a Procedure is, the Compari&s;on already made of the Earth on one Side, with the re&s;t of the World on the other, does more than &s;uffici|ently demon&s;trate.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) No Bodies but the Earth have either Time for, or Particulars of, the Formation of the &s;everal Parts a&s;&s;ign'd. For when four Days are wholly taken up with the Particulars relating to our Earth; the Divi&s;ion of its Aerial from its Earthly Waters; the di&s;tingui&s;hing the latter from the dry Land, and draining 'em into the Channels of the Seas; the Growth of Plants; Generation of Fi&s;h, Fowl, and Terre&s;trial Ani|mals; and at la&s;t the Creation of Man, with &s;e|veral Circum&s;tances relating to him, and the other Creatures; not a Syllable as to the Particulars of the re&s;t of the World.

Which how indecent it is, I had rather leave to the Judgment of the Reader, than to &s;tand here to exaggerate; e&s;pe|cially where the naked Repre&s;entation of the Thing it &s;elf is a &s;ufficient expo&s;ing thereof to free Thinkers.</P>

Whoever will take the Pains carefully to con&s;ider the Sy&s;tem of Nature, and compare it with the&s;e Remarks, and the common Opini|on of the proper Creation of all Things in the &s;ix Days Work, will not, I believe, be at a lo&s;s for Arguments to over-turn the old, and to prove that a <HI>New Theory</HI> is to be enquir'd after, and a narrower World to be expected in the Fir&s;t Chap|ter of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI>, than has generally been.</P>
<P>But before I conclude this Head, I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that the Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Matters has had &s;o great Influence on our late mo&s;t Ex|cellent Commentator on <HI>Gene&s;is</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bi&s;hop <HI>Patrick</HI>.</NOTE> that tho' he keep more &s;trictly to the Letter of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> than others, yet he finds Occa&s;ion and Room for the&s;e four great Conce&s;&s;ions, no le&s;s contrary to the vulgar, than approaching to the pre&s;ent Account of the Hi&s;tory of the Creation.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) He is willing to allow that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> meddles

To make a va&s;t Number of Planets, (every way as capable of Creatures of their own) only for the Sake of us on Earth; that we might in the Night|time view and calculate their Po&s;itions and Mo|tions! To place five &s;econdary Planets about <HI>Sa|turn</HI>, and four about <HI>Jupiter</HI>, that after for more than &s;ix thou&s;and years no one had dream'd of their Exi&s;tence, a few A&s;tronomers might, with their Gla&s;&s;es, peep at them, and ob&s;erve their Pe|riods! To appoint the Orbit of one of the primary Planets (<HI>Mercury</HI>) &s;o near the Sun, that not one in a hundred ever gets a di&s;tinct View of him all his Life! To move the Comets in Orbits &s;o ex|tremely large and elliptical or oblong, that by their Di&s;tance from the Planetary Regions mo&s;t part of each Revolution, they &s;hould be &s;o little ob&s;ervable, that the World were ju&s;t end|ing before they could be known to be other than Ma&s;&s;es of Vapours &s;oon conjoin'd, and as &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated again, and now not vi&s;ible the hundredth or perhaps thou&s;andth Part of their Periods! To make all this immen&s;e Frame of the Heavenly Sy&s;tems, &s;o Glorious, Augu&s;t and Magnificent, and &s;o de&s;erving of our Con|templation; and yet withal to frame our Eyes and Sen&s;ations in that manner, as to be unca|pable to di&s;cern or imagine any thing thereof in Compari&s;on! &s;o that had not A&s;tronomical Ob|&s;ervation rectify'd our Mi&s;takes, we mu&s;t have thought the whole World not near &s;o big as one of its lea&s;t Bodies really is; and all this without any farther Pro&s;pect, or nobler De&s;ign, than the &s;ingle

<P>And here, from a general View of what has been &s;aid on the&s;e three la&s;t Arguments, we cannot but ob&s;erve into what erroneous Extremes good Men have been betray'd, with relation to &s;everal main Difficulties occurring in the Sacred Writings: While from a profound Re&s;pect to the revealed Word of God, the mo&s;t were willing to lay a&s;ide the U&s;e of their own Rea&s;on; and others from a no le&s;s Veneration for the Divine Attributes, and Regard to tho&s;e common Notions which God had implanted in their Souls, were willing to indulge too great a Liberty in the Interpretation of Scri|pture. The former, being generally pious and de|vout Souls, but little vers'd in Contemplation, or the Improvements of natural Knowledge, were di&s;pos'd to receive all that a Vulgar and Religious, tho' le&s;s Wary and Prudent Expo&s;ition, &s;hould re|commend to their A&s;&s;ent. The latter having ad|ded to their Piety and Virtue, a careful Enquiry

into Nature, and a freer Exerci&s;e of their human Faculties, and ob&s;erving how heavy Imputations &s;ome common Interpretations laid on the Divine Maje&s;ty, how di&s;agreeable they were to external Nature, as well as the Rea&s;on of Mankind, were carried too far on the other hand; and whil&s;t the latter were &s;ecur'd, were not proportionably &s;ol|licitous about the former: I mean, &s;o that nothing but what Rea&s;on, the Attributes of God, and the Sy&s;tem of the World allow'd, were admitted, the&s;e did not take a proportionable Care that the natural Sen&s;e of Scripture were equally provided for.</P>
<P>What I would here farther ob&s;erve, is, the equal Condition and De&s;erts, but the unequal Re|putation and Fate the&s;e two &s;orts of Men have ge|nerally met with in the Chri&s;tian World. Their Characters to me &s;eem &s;o corre&s;pondent, and their contrary Mi&s;takes &s;o equally wide from Truth, equally derogatory to the Honour of God, and yet equally proceeding from a Religious Principle, a De&s;ire to &s;ecure the Intere&s;t of Divine Revelation; that to me they &s;eem to de&s;erve the &s;ame Re&s;pect and Commendation for their &s;incere Endeavours, and pious Intentions; the &s;ame Pity and Pardon for their Errors and Mi&s;takes.

<P>'Tis well known what great, and hitherto in|&s;uperable Difficulties the&s;e Hi&s;tories have invol|ved in them, to the general View of Mankind; and how much &s;till greater, and &s;till more in&s;upe|rable tho&s;e Difficulties appear'd to Philo&s;ophick Enquirers, who came more nicely to con&s;ider them, and compare what was a&s;&s;erted in the Holy Scriptures, with the true Frame and Sy&s;tem of Ex|ternal Nature. The Con&s;ideration of the&s;e Things &s;o affected a great and good Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> T.

In which Matters, he employ'd his utmo&s;t Skill in the be&s;t Sy&s;tem of Philo&s;ophy then known in the World; his mo&s;t diligent Re&s;earches into the &s;acred and prophane Accounts relating to tho&s;e anciently more known <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature, together with &s;uch other Helps as his own excellent Abilities could afford him; and that as to &s;everal main and principal Strokes, to very great Satisfaction, and to the ve|ry remarkable Illu&s;tration of the Holy Scriptures.

<P>But to wave the&s;e too ambitious Expectations, I cannot but &s;ay &s;o much in Behalf of that Learned <HI>Theori&s;t</HI>, That as he ju&s;tly de&s;erves the highe&s;t Commendations for &s;o generous and wor|thy an Attempt; for the great Illu&s;tration he has given tho&s;e Hi&s;tories from the mo&s;t ancient Tra|ditionary Learning; and the Light afforded to the Holy Scriptures in &s;everal, and tho&s;e very con&s;iderable Points; &s;o he has, I think, Rea&s;on to expect an ea&s;y Pardon where he was not able to do the &s;ame; e&s;pecially, when not only Par|don, but the free&s;t Prai&s;es are be&s;tow'd on tho&s;e, who, as I before ob&s;erv'd, equally have expos'd the Honour of God, and equally derogated from the Reputation of the Sacred Writings by their unwary and unskilful Interpretations. A good Man, who to the highe&s;t Veneration for the Per|fections of the Divine Nature, has join'd a care|ful Enquiry into the Frame of the World, and a free, but mode&s;t U&s;e of tho&s;e Faculties God has given him; and has withal exactly con&s;ider'd the undoubted Evidence for the Divine Authority of the Scripture; ought to be, and will be as tender of believing a Sen&s;e which is contrary to his in|nate Notions, to the Perfections of God, and the certain Ob&s;ervations of Nature, as of that which puts a force upon the Words them&s;elves, and ren|ders them meerly Popular and Mythological.

<P>Upon this View of the whole Matter give me Leave to &s;ay, That to make the Univer&s;al Frame of Nature concern'd in the particular Fates and Revolutions of our Earth, is, at this time of day, to demon&s;trate either very mean Thoughts of the Ends of the Divine Workman&s;hip, and of the Effects thereof in the World; or el&s;e very proud and extravagant Conceits of our own Worth and Dignity; and at be&s;t argues a narrow, igno|ble and unphilo&s;ophical Soul. 'Tis much &s;uch another wi&s;e and rational Notion, as it would be to &s;uppo&s;e that the whole Terraqueous Globe, with all its Parts and Dependencies, all its Furni|ture and Productions, was alike concern'd in the <HI>Fates</HI> and <HI>Revolutions</HI> (pardon the Expre&s;&s;ions) of one &s;ingle Fly or Worm belonging to it. And we may e'en as fairly allow the entire De|pendance of this &s;ublunary World on the Fortune of &s;uch a &s;ingle <HI>animalculum</HI>; that on its peep|ing into the World, the whole Earth mu&s;t ari&s;e out of nothing to afford it a re&s;ting Place; while
<PB N="90" REF="101">
it was growing, and continued in its Prime, all things below mu&s;t &s;pring and flouri&s;h, rejoice and look gay; on its Decay, all things mu&s;t put on a mournful Countenance; and on its De&s;tru|ction, Univer&s;al Nature here beneath mu&s;t expire together, and return to its primitive Nothing. This Repre&s;entation will, I imagine, &s;eem bold and extravagant; but 'twill be hard to prove it &s;o. And I may appeal to A&s;tronomy whether the Earth can be &s;hewn to bear as con&s;iderable a Proportion to the Univer&s;e, as &s;uch a poor <HI>animal-culum</HI> does certainly bear to it.</P>
<P>I would not by this, or any thing el&s;e I have heretofore &s;aid in this Di&s;cour&s;e, be &s;o far mi&s;taken, as to be believ'd prone to depreciate and deba&s;e Mankind; or to put a &s;light on all tho&s;e Works of Nature and Providence which are &s;ub&s;ervient to it. Neither do I deny that in &s;ome Sen&s;e all the Vi&s;ible World, Heaven and Earth, are ordain'd for our U&s;e and Advantage; I fully believe that we are the Creatures of God, of whom he has a tender Regard, and over whom he exer|ci&s;es a con&s;tant, a &s;pecial Care and Providence. As I look upon the Souls of Men, in their proper and primitive Perfection, when they came out of their Maker's Hand, to be Noble, to be Glorious, to be Exalted Beings, and perhaps in Capacities or Faculties, in Dignity or Happine&s;s, not inferior to the Angelick Order; &s;o I al&s;o mo&s;t undoubted|ly believe what our Saviour affirms of good Mens State hereafter, that they &s;hall be <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>equal to the Angels</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke xx.36.</NOTE> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>Children of God him&s;elf</HI>.

<PB N="91" REF="102">
and the Sanctification and Operation of the Holy Spirit: While I am per&s;uaded that the Divine <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> has ever &s;ince the Fall of <HI>Adam</HI> been &s;ollicitous about our Reconciliation to God his Father, and made it his con&s;tant Bu&s;ine&s;s, even before as well as &s;ince his Incarnation, to mediate for us, and take care of our eternal Hap|pine&s;s: While I believe that by the new Cove|nant good Men, even in this imperfect State, are e&s;teem'd <HI>Heirs of God, joint-heirs with Chri&s;t</HI>, and denominated the <HI>Brethren</HI> and <HI>Friends</HI> of their Glo|rious Redeemer: While I do not doubt but our hu|man Nature is now, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, in the Per&s;on of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, in Heaven; and there on account of the Union with the Divine <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and as a Reward of that Obedience and Suffering He underwent for us on Earth, advanc'd above the mo&s;t exalted intellectual Orders, at the Right Hand of the Maje&s;ty on High: While I expect the &s;ame Per&s;on in the Glory of the Father, coming to judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and Mankind after that final Doom, to be Partaker of everla&s;ting Joy or Mi&s;ery according to their Behaviour here on Earth. While, I &s;ay, I believe all this, as I mo&s;t &s;incerely do, I can be under no Temptation of looking with Contempt upon or of entertaining a mean Opinion of Mankind, or of tho&s;e Sy&s;tems of Nature and Providence re|lating to it. Yet, all this notwith&s;tanding, I think that Opinion I am now expo&s;ing, de&s;erves no other Character than I have before given of it.</P>
<P>Tho' I look upon Mankind as one Species of very Noble and Glorious Creatures, yet I &s;up|po&s;e it but <HI>One</HI>; and that there may be Millions of others at the lea&s;t not inferior to him. Tho' I believe human Nature, when Innocent and Per|fect, at that Height of Purity and Felicity which
<PB N="92" REF="103">
it once had, and by the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation may be again advanc'd to, as &s;o con&s;iderable and exalted a Species of Beings; yet withal I look up|on it at pre&s;ent as under a very different Character. We are all now in a deprav'd, a &s;inful, and &s;o in a low, a mi&s;erable State. We have by our own wil|ful Rebellion and Di&s;obedience, made it nece&s;&s;ary for God to place us in a &s;hort, a vicious, in an un|ea&s;y and vexatious World; where at pre&s;ent we are under a &s;ort of Confinement, in a Place of Trial and Probation; and through a doleful Wilderne&s;s mu&s;t make our way to the Land of <HI>Canaan.

I &s;ee no Rea|&s;on to e&s;teem the pre&s;ent Condition of Mortality as at all con&s;iderable <HI>in it &s;elf</HI>, (tho' in its <HI>Con&s;e|quences</HI> it extremely be &s;o) in Compari&s;on of the future Periods of our Beings; and therefore with|out believing the Earth one of the greate&s;t or noble&s;t Globes in the World, I can &s;uppo&s;e it a very proper and &s;uitable Habitation for us at pre&s;ent: Mo&s;t wi&s;ely contriv'd, (as it certainly is;) and its Furniture peculiarly and wonder|fully adapted to our Needs, Capacities and Ope|rations. I acknowledge that Providence has &s;o con|&s;tituted our Earth that we receive &s;ome Advantages from all, and very great ones from &s;ome other Parts of the external and vi&s;ible World. All which were in the original Creation of things both fore|&s;een and forede&s;ign'd by God, and &s;o may not im|properly
<PB N="93" REF="104">
be &s;o far &s;aid to have been made for our U&s;e, and appointed to &s;erve our Nece&s;&s;ities. I do not think that tho&s;e Sy&s;tems of the Univer&s;e we here &s;peak of, are ever a whit the le&s;s u&s;eful to us, or the Benefits we reap from them ever the le&s;s in them&s;elves, or unworthy of our Notice and Ob&s;ervation, our Admiration and Gratitude to God, becau&s;e they al&s;o are &s;ub&s;ervient to other noble Purpo&s;es, and are by Divine Providence made u&s;e of in &s;everal great De&s;igns over and above tho&s;e Advantages we are able to take notice of, or can our &s;elves enjoy from them. I cannot ima|gine that God is peculiarly fond of any particular Parts of the Material Creation, or any more a <HI>Re&s;pecter of</HI> &s;ome <HI>Inanimate Bodies</HI>, than of <HI>Per|&s;ons</HI>. He no doubt equally makes u&s;e of them all, according to their &s;everal Kinds and Capacities, in the Service of the various Species of Intelligent Creatures, and in the bringing about the great Periods of Nature, and the Decrees of Heaven; which as they are in great mea&s;ure unknown to us, &s;o may they regard Rational Beings very diffe|rent and remote from us and our Concerns.</P>
<P>If we duly reflect on the Infinite Nature, and unlimited Perfections of the Divine Being, the Creator and Original of all Things; as well as on the Number, Va&s;tne&s;s, and Glory of tho&s;e his Works which are within our View, we &s;hall &s;ee Rea&s;on to confe&s;s, there may be Millions of nobler Intelle|ctual Beings interpo&s;ed between Man and God; and the whole World might be more rea&s;onably &s;uppos'd made at the Creation, and for the &s;ole U&s;e of any one Species of tho&s;e, than of Mankind.

<HI>Gravitation</HI> towards it. Tho' indeed, by the way, the Force or Affection being found to be mutual and equal on both Sides, the Terms might ju&s;tly be &s;o too; and a Load&s;tone might as properly be &s;aid to tend or <HI>gravitate</HI> towards the Iron, or Iron to <HI>attract</HI> the Load&s;tone, as the contrary; ju&s;t as 'tis in the Point before us.

<P><HI>Scholium.</HI> That no Prejudice nor Mi&s;under&s;tand|ing may ari&s;e, 'tis to be ob&s;erv'd, That when we u&s;e the Terms of Attraction or Gravitation, we do not thereby determine the Phy&s;ical Cau&s;e or Seat of any Effects, as if &s;ome innate Power or <HI>occult Quality</HI> were to be &s;uppos'd in Bodies, (as will appear pre&s;ently;) but only u&s;e &s;uch fami|liar Terms whereby our Meaning may be ea&s;ily under&s;tood, and the Effects of Nature explain'd, even where the la&s;t and proper efficient Cau&s;e is not mechanically a&s;&s;ignable. Thus we do and may &s;ay, as before, That the Load&s;tone attracts the Iron, or the Iron tends or gravitates to the Load&s;tone: not a&s;cribing thereby any proper or po&s;itive Quality or Power to the&s;e Bodies, but for Ea&s;e of Expre&s;&s;ion, and for &s;upplying what we cannot otherwi&s;e readily explain relating to them.

<P N="7">VII. The Quantity of the Force of Attraction at equal Di&s;tances is exactly proportionable to the Quantity of Matter in the attracting Body; be|ing in reality nothing but the Re&s;ult or Sum of the united Forces of all tho&s;e &s;ingle Particles of which 'tis compos'd.

<P N="8">VIII. This mutual Tendency of Bodies is greater or le&s;s, according as the Bodies them&s;elves are nearer to, or farther from each other. The &s;ame Body more forcibly attracting tho&s;e which are near, than tho&s;e which are farther off.

In like manner, the &s;ame Strength which were able to &s;u&s;tain a Body of one hundred Weight here, would at twice our Di&s;tance from the Earth's Center, be equally able to &s;u&s;tain four hundred Weight; at three times our Di&s;tance, nine hundred Weight; at four times our Di&s;tance, &s;ixteen hundred Weight,

<P>Coroll. <HI>Hence we may learn what is that</HI> cona|tus recedendi &agrave; centro mot&ucirc;s <HI>in revolving Bodies,
<PB N="9" REF="115">
and in what Sen&s;e 'tis to be under&s;tood. For &s;ince, as we have already &s;een, all Bodies have a</HI> Vis cen|tripeta, <HI>or Propen&s;ion towards one another, 'tis impo&s;|&s;ible they &s;hould of them&s;elves, in as proper a man|ner, have a contrary Propen&s;ion, or</HI> Vis centrifuga, <HI>an Endeavour of avoiding one another, (if the&s;e im|proper Terms will be allow'd me.) The true Meaning therefore of this</HI> Attempt <HI>or</HI> Endeavour <HI>to get farther off the Center of Motion is only this, That all Bodies being purely Pa&s;&s;ive, and &s;o incapable of altering their uniform Motion along tho&s;e &s;trait Lines, or Tangents to their Curves, in which they are every Moment, &s;till tend onwards in the &s;ame Lines, and retain their Propen&s;ion or Effort towards that rectilinear Motion all the Time they are obliged to move in Curves; and con&s;equently at every Point of their Cour&s;e, en|deavour to fly off by their Tangents. Now the Parts of the Tangent to which this Endeavour is, being farther from the Center than tho&s;e of the Curves to which the Bodies are actually forc'd, an Attempt to go on in the Tangent may be, and is &s;til'd an</HI> At|tempt to <HI>go farther off or</HI> recede from that Cen|ter; <HI>tho' from no other Affection than that of Inacti|vity, or of per&s;evering in a rectilinear Motion. So that tho' the</HI> Vis centripeta, <HI>or Power of Gravita|tion be an active and po&s;itive Force, continually re|new'd and impre&s;s'd on Bodies; the</HI> Vis centrifuga, <HI>or</HI> conatus recedendi &agrave; centro mot&ucirc;s, <HI>is not &s;o, but the mere Con&s;equent and Re&s;ult from their Ina|ctivity. This is evident in Bodies revolving in</HI> El|lip&s;es <HI>about one of the</HI> Foci, <HI>in their De&s;cent towards it; where the Tangent being oblique to the Radius, or Line, from the Point of Contact to the</HI> Focus, <HI>this very</HI> conatus recedendi &agrave; centro mot&ucirc;s, <HI>by urging it along the Tangent, will for &s;ome Time make it approach nearer to the</HI> Focus; <HI>(tho' not &s;o much nearer as by its revolving in the Ellip&s;is it &s;elf;) as may be &s;een in the Scheme, if a Body at</HI>

B <HI>were moving towards</HI> L <HI>about the Focus</HI> H.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schem. 1. Fig. 6.</NOTE> <HI>And this Explication is confirm'd by all Experience. For let a Stone be let loo&s;e from the Sling, or any revol|ving Body be di&s;engag'd from the Force which re|tain'd it in its Curve, and it will not properly go from the Center, but only pa&s;s along the Tangent in which it was moving, as if there were no &s;uch Cen|ter near it at all.</HI></P>
<P N="11">XI. A Rectilinear or Projectile Motion of the Planets along the Tangents to their Orbits, (which when once begun, always uniformly continues,) join'd or compounded with their Gravitation to the Sun, in the common Center, or rather <HI>Focus</HI> of our Sy&s;tem, is the Original of all the Planetary Revolutions about him. Thus if <HI>Jupiter</HI>, for in&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 3.</NOTE> repre&s;ented by B, were moving uniform|ly along the Line DC, from D towards C; if the Sun A were ab&s;ent, the Planet would pa&s;s on &s;traight from B to C, with the &s;ame Velocity with which it had come from D to B. But if upon its Arrival at the Point B, the Sun in the Center or <HI>Focus</HI> A begin to affect it, the Planet, by the Sun's Attraction, mu&s;t be drawn from a re|ctilinear to a curvilinear Cour&s;e; and be oblig'd, if the Sun's Power be great enough, compar'd with the Planet's Velocity, to revolve about him, and that, the attractive Force always continuing, for ever after. The Ca&s;e is ju&s;t the &s;ame as if B were a Stone in a Sling, A the Hand of the Slinger, (by the Help of the Strings united together, and repre&s;ented by the Line AB,) whirling it round continually. For as the Stone at its coming to the Point B, were it let loo&s;e and left to it &s;elf, would fly off in the &s;traight Line or Tangent BC, yet by Force is &s;till retain'd at an equal Di|&s;tance from the Hand of the Slinger, and com|pell'd to revolve in a kind of Circle; &s;o 'tis here.
<PB N="11" REF="117">
The Attraction of the Sun in the common Cen|ter or <HI>Focus</HI> compels all the Planets, which of them&s;elves would pa&s;s along their &s;everal Tan|gents, to revolve about it &s;elf, and de&s;cribe their &s;everal curvilinear Orbits. And the Ca&s;e is the &s;ame in the &s;econdary Planets with re&s;pect to their primary ones, about which they revolve in the &s;ame manner as they all both Primary and Secon|dary revolve about the Sun, in the common Cen|ter or <HI>Focus</HI> of the entire Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>Coroll. 1. <HI>Hence 'tis manife&s;t, that the Law of univer&s;al Attraction once e&s;tabli&s;h'd, unle&s;s the Di|vine Power had put the Planets into a &s;uitable Motion in right Lines, they mu&s;t &s;oon have been drawn down|wards, and fall'n into the Sun: And &s;till, if their Motions &s;hould be entirely &s;topp'd and cea&s;e, the &s;ame mu&s;t happen; and they mu&s;t not only be uncapable of tho&s;e noble U&s;es to which they are now &s;ub&s;ervient, but utterly peri&s;h in the Violence of the Sun's &s;corch|ing Heat. The preventing of which therefore ought ju&s;tly to be attributed to the Wi&s;dom and Power of God in the Con&s;titution of the World.</HI></P>

of the entire Univer&s;e compos'd one &s;ingle dull and unmovable Heap or Ma&s;s in the common Center of Gravity of the whole; which not having happen'd, demon&s;trates the Impo&s;&s;ibility of the Eternity of the World, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of admitting its Producti|on in Time by the Power of God. Since therefore 'tis unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e the Material World truly unlimited in Extent, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e it no more unlimited in Duration al&s;o. And this Rea&s;on|ing is unavoidable, unle&s;s we allow the mo&s;t inva|riable and con&s;tant Property of Matter in our Sy&s;tem to be</HI> peculiar <HI>to it, and &s;o to be a voluntary Con&s;ti|tution of God Almighty; or at lea&s;t that a miracu|lous Providence does hinder the foremention'd Effect continually.

<P N="12">XII. When the Projectile Motion of the Pla|nets is in its Direction, perpendicular to a Line from the Sun, and in its Degree of Velocity, &s;o nicely adapted and contemper'd to the Quantity of the Sun's Attraction there, that neither can over|come the other, (the Force of Gravitation towards the Sun, and the Celerity of the Planets proper Mo|tions being properly <HI>in Aequilibrio</HI>,) the Orbits of &s;uch revolving Planets will be compleat Circles; them&s;elves neither approaching to, nor receding from the Sun, the Center of their Motions. And the Ca&s;e is the &s;ame in the Secondary Planets about their Primary ones. Thus 'tis &s;uppo&s;able, that the Velocity of all the Planets about the Sun, was exactly accommodate originally to his Power of Attraction, and that their primitive Orbits were perfect Circles; from which at this Day they do not mightily differ.

Several Bodies moving about the &s;ame Central one, tho' their primitive Velocity were equal, and Direction alike; yet if they be at diffe|rent Di&s;tances from it, they will de&s;cribe Figures of different Species about it.

Bent|ley, <HI>Ser. 8.</HI></NOTE> <HI>and his mo&s;t accurate Contrivance in the Di&s;po&s;al and Regulation of the whole: Whereby the primary Velocity of the Planets, their &s;everal Di&s;tan|ces from the Central Bodies, and the original Dire|ction of their Motions, have been each &s;o nicely ad|ju&s;ted and adapted to the Force of Attraction every where, that all the Orbits of the Planets became there|by either truly circular, or not very much different from the &s;ame. Which Remark will appear the more ju&s;t, and con&s;iderable, if we reflect on the infinitely diffe|rent Degrees of Velocity, and oblique Direction; with the immen&s;ly various Di&s;tances from the Central Bo|dies; equally po&s;&s;ible with tho&s;e which were &s;o fitly pitch'd upon; and ob&s;erve to what noble and valua|ble U&s;es the&s;e Bodies are now &s;ub&s;ervient, which, without the foremention'd Exactne&s;s of Contrivance in each Particular, could not have been provided for. All which demon&s;trate the great Nece&s;&s;ity of intere&s;t|ing the Divine Providence; and the Worthine&s;s of its &s;o careful Interpo&s;ition in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Scholium.</HI> In order to the ea&s;ier Apprehen&s;ion of the Motions of the Cele&s;tial Bodies, and of tho&s;e Things already &s;aid, or to be &s;aid here|after, relating to them, 'twill not be improper in this Place to give &s;ome Account of the Genera|tion, Nature, and ea&s;y Properties of <HI>Ellip&s;es</HI>; in which, (including the Circle, as is commonly done) all the Heavenly Bodies, (as far as we have hitherto Rea&s;on to believe) revolve perpetually; &s;o far at lea&s;t as will be directly &s;ub&s;ervient to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, and give any Light to the follow|ing Theory.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Carte&s;. Dioptr.</HI> c. 8, &amp;c.</NOTE> Take therefore, from the famous <HI>Des Cartes</HI>, this natural and obvious De&s;cription
<PB N="17" REF="123">
or Delineation of an <HI>Oval</HI> or <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI>; which tho' familiar to the Gardiner and Joyner, is a very good one; and gives as ju&s;t and complet an <HI>Idea</HI> of it as any other what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Take a &s;mall Cord or Packthread,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 6.</NOTE> which is ve|ry pliable, and yet not ea&s;ily &s;tretch'd beyond its natural Length; Tye the two Ends together, by which means it will be a &s;ort of round or circular Circumference mutable into all Figures. Let two Pins or Nails, H and I, be driven into a plain Board or Table; put the Cord or Packthread round the two Pins or Nails H and I, and with a Pencil or any &s;uch thing, (which, as it is drawn along, will make a &s;mall Stroke,) in your Hand, turn it round about the two Pins or Nails, as about a double Centre, till you return to the Point from whence you began. Thus if B be the Point where you begin the Delineation, continue it either way, along OFMKNEPD, or DPENKMFO,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 6. Schem. 1.</NOTE> till you return to B again. By this means the Point of your Pencil will de&s;cribe &s;uch a Curve as is here repre&s;ented, and is call'd an <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI>. The Nature and Properties whereof, as far as at pre&s;ent we &s;hall con&s;ider the &s;ame, are as follow.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The Species of the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> depends on the Proportion there is between the length of the Cord, and the di&s;tance of the two Centres H and I: And con&s;equently, wherever that determinate Propor|tion is given, the Species is given al&s;o, tho' the Bigne&s;s and Capacity be chang'd; But where that Proportion is not given, as, the Length of the Cord remaining, where the Di&s;tance of the Cen|tres is chang'd; or, that Di&s;tance remaining, the Length of the Cord is chang'd; or both are chang'd, but not in the &s;ame Proportion; in all the&s;e Ca&s;es the Species of the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> is different. Thus in particular where the Di&s;tance of the Centers, or the
<PB N="18" REF="124">
Line HI, is greater in proportion to the Length of the Cord, there the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> is farther from; and where 'tis le&s;s, the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> is nearer to a Cir|cle. All which is &s;o obvious on a very little Con|&s;ideration of the Delineation, and Figure, as 'tis repre&s;ented in the two different Schemes, that no more words need be us'd about it.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) If in a con&s;iderably large Figure the two Points H and I be very near together, it will be &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hable from a Circle; and in any Figure if they be &s;uppos'd to unite, and be coin|cident, the Eccentrical Curve will become Con|centrical; and the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> degenerate into a Cir|cle; as perfect an one, as any drawn with a Pair of Compa&s;&s;es. Whence we &s;ee why a Circle is reckon'd among the <HI>Ellip&s;es</HI>; and how it may be generated by a Way very like that made u&s;e of in their Delineation.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) As when the Points H and I are coinci|dent, the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> lo&s;es its Eccentricity, and Deno|mination, and commences a Circle; &s;o, on the other Hand, if the Di&s;tance HI be indefinitely lengthened, while the difference betwen that Di|&s;tance and the Length of the Cord, (equal to DH and IK, or double to one DH; as, the Pencil at D, is ea&s;ily perceiv'd,) remains the &s;ame, the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> will go thro' all Species; and at la&s;t become inde|finitely Oblong and Eccentrical; and one half of it, as FDE, will degenerate into the very &s;ame Figure we call a <HI>Parabola</HI>. For as all Degrees of Eccentricity make <HI>Ellip&s;es</HI> of all Species; &s;o no Degree of Eccentricity makes a Circle; and an in|definite or infinite Degree of it make a <HI>Parabola:</HI> Which, tho' we have no nece&s;&s;ity to con&s;ider it &s;o di&s;tinctly in this place; (none of the heavenly Bodies, as far as we yet know, de&s;cribing truly &s;uch a Line, as has been already ob&s;erv'd;) yet
<PB N="19" REF="125">
on account of the Comets Orbits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 1.</NOTE> which are near|ly <HI>Parabolical</HI>, at lea&s;t de&s;erv'd our Notice; and the fir&s;t Figure will &s;hew an Example of it.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) An <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> being de&s;crib'd about two Points, as a Circle about one, or tho&s;e two uni|ted; hence may appear in &s;ome mea&s;ure the Na|ture of the&s;e Points. They are indeed called the <HI>Foci</HI> or <HI>Umbilici</HI> of the Figure, but might not un|fitly be nam'd the <HI>Centers</HI> thereof. And how natu|rally each of them bears much the &s;ame re&s;pect to the <HI>Elliptick</HI> Periphery, that the <HI>Center</HI> does to the circular one, is partly obvious from the foregoing Delineation; and of this tho&s;e who are acquainted with the <HI>Conick Sections</HI> cannot be ignorant. And accordingly, if the Name <HI>Center</HI> had not by Cu&s;tom in the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> been borrowed from the Circle on account of its Po&s;ition, rather than &s;ome other Properties of it, and thence apply'd to the middle Point in the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI>; it might very fitly, as has been before &s;aid, have been given to the two Points H and I, now &s;til'd the <HI>Foci</HI> or <HI>Umbilici</HI> thereof. And by the &s;ame Rea&s;on, the corre&s;pond|ing &s;ingle Points, going under the &s;ame Names in the <HI>Parabola</HI> and <HI>Hyperbola</HI>, would de&s;erve and challenge the &s;ame Denomination. And this is &s;o agreeable to the true Sy&s;tem of the Planetary World, that in the new A&s;tronomy, (and thence in the&s;e Papers,) the Stile is &s;ometimes continued; and 'tis not unu&s;ual, I may add, not very impro|per, to &s;ay, That the Sun, the common <HI>Focus</HI> or <HI>Umbilicus</HI> of all the Cele&s;tial <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbits, is in the <HI>Center</HI> of our Sy&s;tem, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the <HI>Cen|ter</HI> of the Planetary World.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) Tho' all the Lines pa&s;&s;ing through the Center in a Circle, being equal, are equally con|&s;iderable; yet 'tis otherwi&s;e in the <HI>Conick Sections</HI>; where that Line through the <HI>Focus</HI> alone which
<PB N="20" REF="126">
cuts the principal <HI>Axis</HI> at right Angles, is remark|able above all the re&s;t; and in very many Ca&s;es peculiarly con&s;iderable. This Line is &s;til'd the <HI>La|tus Rectum</HI> or <HI>Parameter</HI>, and in the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> is, after the longer and &s;horter <HI>Axis</HI>, the third Pro|portional. Thus in the Figure before us, as DK is to EF, &s;o is the &s;ame EF to OP or MN, the <HI>Latus Rectum</HI> or <HI>Parameter</HI> thereof, &s;o famous with the Writers on the <HI>Conick Sections</HI>.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) The Subten&s;e of the Angle of Contact <HI>bd</HI>, parallel to the Di&s;tance from the <HI>Focus</HI> BH, at an equal perpendicular Di&s;tance from the Point of Contact B, if that Di&s;tance be &s;uppos'd infinitely &s;mall, is in all Parts of the &s;ame <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI>, or other <HI>Conick Section</HI>, equal to it &s;elf. The Truth and U&s;e of which Property is not yet &s;ufficiently known.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) If from any Point in the Circumference of an <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> as B, Lines be drawn to each <HI>Focus</HI>, BH, BI; the&s;e two Lines taken together are al|ways equal to them&s;elves, and to the longer <HI>Axis</HI> KD: As the bare Delineation of the Figure does plainly manife&s;t.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) If the Angle made by the Lines to the <HI>Foci</HI> from any certain Point, HBI, be divided in the mid&s;t by the Line BA; the &s;aid Line BA will be perpendicular to the Tangent, or Curve at the Point of Contact; and &s;o the Angles ABL, ABG, will be right ones, and equal to each other, as con&s;equently will equal Parts of them, LBH, IBG.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) A Line drawn from either <HI>Focus</HI> to the End of the le&s;&s;er <HI>Axis</HI>, HE or IE, is equal to half the longer <HI>Axis</HI> CD or CK; as is evident by the la&s;t Particular but one. And the &s;ame Line is Arithmetically the middle Proportional between the greate&s;t and lea&s;t Di&s;tance from the &s;aid <HI>Focus</HI>.
<PB N="21" REF="127">
Thus HE, for in&s;tance, is ju&s;t &s;o much longer than HD, as 'tis &s;horter than HK; the Difference in both Ca&s;es being the <HI>Eccentricity</HI> HC or CI.</P>
<P N="10">(10.) The Tangent of an <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> LG is never perpendicular to a Line drawn from the <HI>Focus</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 6. Schem. 1.</NOTE> except at the two Points which terminate the longer <HI>Axis</HI> D and K. And if you imagine the Point of Contact B, with the Radius BH, and the Tangent LG, to move round the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> to|gether, from B towards D; the preceding An|gle, HBL, will, in the De&s;cent from K by F to D, be an acute one; (its Acutene&s;s increa&s;ing from K to F, and as much decrea&s;ing from F to D;) and in the A&s;cent from D by E to K an ob|tu&s;e one; (its Obtu&s;ene&s;s increa&s;ing from D to E; and as much decrea&s;ing from E to K:) In both Semi-revolutions arriving at Rightne&s;s at the Points D and K, the Ends of the longer <HI>Axis</HI> alone; as was here to be ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P N="11">(11.) The <HI>Area</HI> of an <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> is to that of a cir|cum&s;crib'd Circle, (who&s;e Diameter is equal to the others longer <HI>Axis</HI>,) as the &s;horter <HI>Axis</HI> of the <HI>El|lip&s;is</HI> is to the &s;ame longer <HI>Axis</HI> or Diameter.</P>
<P N="12">(12.) If the Circumferences of a Circle, and of an <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI>, be equal; the <HI>Area</HI> of the Circle is the greater. It being known, that of all Fi|gures, who&s;e <HI>Perimeters</HI> are equal, the Circle is the mo&s;t capacious.</P>
<P N="13">(13.) If an <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI>, by becoming infinitely Eccentrical, degenerate into a <HI>Parabola</HI>; the <HI>La|tus Rectum</HI> or <HI>Parameter</HI> will be four times as long as the neare&s;t Di&s;tance to the <HI>Focus</HI> thereof.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 1.</NOTE> Thus <HI>rs</HI> is four times as long as Ht.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. All Bodies which, together with a Pro|jectile or Uniform Motion along right Lines, are continually attracted or impell'd towards one cer|tain Point or Center, let the Attraction or Impul&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="128">
be of what Nature or Quantity &s;oever, will al|ways, (no other Force interpo&s;ing) by a Line drawn from that Center to them&s;elves, de&s;cribe equal <HI>Area's</HI> in equal Times; and &s;o proportion|able <HI>Area's</HI> in proportionable Times; through all Parts of their Cour&s;es. Thus if the <HI>Area</HI> de&s;crib'd the fir&s;t Minute were equal to a thou&s;and &s;quare Feet; whether the Bodies came nearer, or went farther off, it would always in a Minute be equal to the &s;ame thou&s;and &s;quare Feet; in two Minutes double, or two thou&s;and; in three Minutes treble, or three thou&s;and; in four Minutes quadruple, or four thou&s;and; and &s;o for ever proportionably. The Demon&s;tration of this noble and exceeding u&s;eful <HI>Theorem</HI>, is both ea&s;y and plea&s;ant: But that not being my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s Philo&s;. Nat. Princip. Math. <HI>p.</HI> 37, 38, 39.</NOTE> I &s;hall, as in the re&s;t, refer the Reader to the Great Author him|&s;elf for Satisfaction.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. All Bodies, <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;</HI>, which revolve in Curves; and by a Line drawn from them&s;elves to a certain Point or Center, de&s;cribe <HI>Area's</HI> propor|tionable to the Times of De&s;cription, are attract|ed or impell'd continually towards that Point or Center.</P>
<P>Corollary. <HI>Since therefore Lines drawn from eve|ry one of the Planets to the Sun, de&s;cribe perpetually</HI> Area's <HI>proportionable to the Times of De&s;cription; as is own'd by all A&s;tronomers; 'tis certain that, be|&s;ides their &s;everal projectile Motions, they are every one continually attracted or impell'd towards the Sun; and from &s;uch compounded Forces revolve about him.

<P N="24">XXIV. If a Planet de&s;cribe an <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> about its central Body in the <HI>Focus</HI> thereof, it will move fa&s;te&s;t when it is neare&s;t to, and &s;lowe&s;t when 'tis farthe&s;t from the &s;aid central Body or <HI>Focus</HI>; and agreeably in the intermediate Places. For &s;eeing
<PB N="28" REF="134">
where&s;oever the revolving Body is, the <HI>Area</HI> is &s;till proportionable to the Time, as was before &s;hew'd; and &s;o in equal Times always equal; 'tis evident by how much the Di&s;tance is le&s;s, and the Line from the <HI>Focus</HI> is &s;horter, by &s;o much mu&s;t the Bodies perpendicular Motion be the &s;wifter to compen&s;ate the &s;ame; and, <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;</HI>, by how much the former is longer, by &s;o much mu&s;t the latter be &s;lower to allow for it.</P>
<P>Coroll. <HI>Hence we may obviate that Difficulty which is &s;o commonly made about the A&s;cent and De&s;cent of Planets or Comets in their Ellip&s;es; e&s;pecially when they are very eccentrical; and &s;o may under&s;tand how a Planet or Comet which de&s;cends towards the Sun, and at la&s;t arrives at his Perihelion, is able &s;o to overcome the Sun's Attraction again, even there where it is great|e&s;t, as to throw it &s;elf farther off, and to a&s;cend from it by the &s;ame Steps, and in the &s;ame Line by which it before de&s;cended. For &s;ince the natural Velocity corre&s;ponding to the Sun's Attraction every where,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. 23. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> <HI>is only in a</HI> &s;ubduplicate Proportion of the Di&s;tance reciprocally; <HI>but the Velocity in any Or|bit what&s;oever will nece&s;&s;arily be in a full</HI> Propor|tion of that Di&s;tance reciprocally, <HI>as we have ju&s;t now ob&s;erv'd, 'tis plain that all the while any Pla|net or Comet is de&s;cending, its Velocity gains upon the Sun's attracting Power; and &s;o after the Body is pa&s;t the End of the &s;horter Axis, (where both are</HI> in Aequilibrio) <HI>and in the</HI> Parabola <HI>in the whole De&s;cent it overcomes it, and throws it &s;elf off per|petually; tho' the oblique de&s;cending Po&s;ition of the Tangent does not permit it to go really farther off till it comes to its Perihelion. 'Tis alike plain that therefore all the while any Planet or Comet is a&s;|cending, its Velocity is gain'd upon by the Sun's at|tracting Power, and &s;o after the Body is pa&s;t the
<PB N="29" REF="135">
other End of the &s;horter Axis it is overcome by it, and is attracted more and more to it perpetually; tho' the oblique a&s;cending Po&s;ition of the Tangent does not per|mit it to approach really nearer till it comes to its Aphelion. And as to the two other Quarters of the Motion, 'tis ea&s;ily &s;tated from what has been &s;aid. For the A&s;cent from the Perihelion till the End of the le&s;&s;er Axis, ari&s;es from the &s;uperabundant Velocity acquir'd in the De&s;cent from the other End of the le&s;&s;er Axis ju&s;t before; and the De&s;cent from the Aphelion till the &s;aid End of the le&s;&s;er Axis ari&s;es from the prevailing Attraction, and Velocity too little to balance it from the other End of the le&s;&s;er Axis ju&s;t before. In &s;hort, while the revolving Body is in the remote Half of the Elliptick Periphery, the Attraction is too hard for the Velocity, and while 'tis in the nearer Half, the Velocity is too hard for the Attraction; and when the Attraction in part con&s;pires with the Tangent or Direction of the projectile Motion, as in the De&s;cent, the Velo|city thence increa&s;es continually; and when it is partly oppo&s;ite to the &s;ame, as in the A&s;cent, the Ve|locity thence dimini&s;hes continually; and thence &s;uch Corre&s;pondence and mutual Superabundance and De|ficience of Velocity mu&s;t happen in the &s;everal Parts of the Orbit perpetually.</HI></P>

<P N="30">XXX. The Order of the Heavenly Bodies in the Solar Sy&s;tem is as follows: <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> of all, The va&s;t glorious Body of the Sun is plac'd in the Middle, very near the Center of Gravity of the entire Sy&s;tem, in the common <HI>Focus</HI> of every one of the Planetary Orbits.

Next to <HI>Venus</HI> our Earth, with its Attendant the Moon, perform a joint Cour&s;e, and mea&s;ure out the An|nual Period. Next to the <HI>Earth</HI> the fiery Star <HI>Mars</HI> alone, without any vi&s;ible Guard accompanying him, revolves about the &s;ame Center. Next to <HI>Mars</HI>, tho' at a mighty Di&s;tance from him, the large&s;t of the Planets, <HI>Jupiter</HI>; with his four re|markable Satellits; and la&s;tly, <HI>Saturn</HI> with his five little <HI>Moons</HI> about him, de&s;cribe the farthe&s;t and mo&s;t remote Orbits, and compleat the entire Planetary <HI>Chorus</HI>, as the Fronti&s;piece of the Book repre&s;ents them to the Contemplation of the <HI>Reader</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="138"><HI>Scholium</HI> 1.

But becau&s;e the&s;e Bodies will be more di&s;tinctly con&s;ider'd hereafter, I &s;hall wave their farther Con&s;ideration at pre&s;ent, and proceed.</P>
<P><HI>Scholium</HI> 2. But as to the fix'd Stars, which are not repre&s;ented in the Figure, they are &s;till &s;o va&s;tly more remote from the Sun, that, tiill very lately, they were thought &s;ubject to no <HI>Parallax</HI> at all, even not to that of the annual Orbit it &s;elf. The Great <HI>Hugenius</HI> by a new, and not improba|ble Method of <HI>conjecturing</HI> their Di&s;tance, in his <HI>Co&s;motheorus</HI>, p. 137. computes that the neare&s;t of them can't well be at a le&s;s Di&s;tance from the Sun, or from us, than 27664 Semidiameters of the <HI>Mag|nus Orbis</HI>; each of which Semidiameters contains by the be&s;t Ob&s;ervations no le&s;s than 81 Millions of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Statute Miles, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently: So that by this Computation, the neare&s;t of the fix'd Stars mu&s;t be about 2240784 Millions of Miles from us. And tho' &s;ince the Noble Di&s;covery of the Annual Parallax of the fix'd Stars by Mr. <HI>Flam|&s;tead</HI>, agreeing with the &s;ame before made by Dr. <HI>Hook</HI>, the Di&s;tance of tho&s;e Stars which have been mea&s;ur'd is not quite &s;o va&s;t and enormous, yet is it &s;till in it &s;elf exceeding great, no le&s;s than 8000 Semidiameters of the <HI>Magnus Orbis</HI>, or about 648000 Millions of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles. And what is in the&s;e Ob&s;ervations mo&s;t remarkable and &s;ur|prizing is this, that tho&s;e three Stars, of very different apparent Magnitude, and very different Places, who&s;e Di&s;tances have been thus accurate|ly
<PB N="33" REF="139">
mea&s;ured, do not appear to be of very diffe|rent Di&s;tances, but almo&s;t all pretty equally re|mote from us; contrary to the general Opinion hitherto; which has &s;uppos'd the fix'd Stars at all manner of various Di&s;tances from us, and tho&s;e which appear'd the &s;malle&s;t to have therefore been at the mo&s;t remote, and the large&s;t at the neare&s;t Places. If on farther Ob&s;ervations this prove to be the Ca&s;e of the re&s;t of the fix'd Stars, we mu&s;t be forc'd to alter our Opinion, and to believe that they are all pretty nearly in a &s;phe|rical Surface from us, and that our Sun, with its Sy&s;tem is, as it were, plac'd in the Center of the re&s;t of the Sy&s;tems, and of the vi&s;ible World. For as to the Learned Dr. <HI>Gregory</HI>'s Objections a|gain&s;t the Force of Mr. <HI>Flam&s;teed</HI>'s Rea&s;oning for the Annual Parallax of the fixed Stars,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A&s;tronom.</HI> p. 275, 276.</NOTE> and the Annual Motion of the Earth con&s;equent thereupon, they are too incon&s;iderable, and too much built on Mi&s;takes to be at all regarded in this Matter, as I have &s;hew'd in another place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philo&s;.

Which things, con&s;idering that the Number of them is continually found to be greater, according as the Tele&s;copes we u&s;e are longer and more perfect, do va&s;tly aggrandize the Idea of the Vi&s;ible Univer&s;e; and ought proportionably to rai&s;e our Admiration of the Great Author of the whole to the highe&s;t Degree imaginable.</P>

a &s;imple Proportion thereof; and is con&s;equent|ly greate&s;t upon the Superficies them&s;elves.

'Tis evident from the A&s;tronomical Tables of the Anticipation of the Equinox, that in 4068 Years (the Time &s;ince the before-mention'd Year till <HI>A.

'Tis farther evident, that whereas now the Space from the Vernal to the Autumnal Equinox is eight or nine Days longer than from the Autumnal to the Vernal, by rea&s;on of the Po&s;ition of the <HI>Perihelion</HI> of the Earth's Orbit near the <HI>Winter</HI> Sol&s;tice; at the time before-mention'd it was not above five or &s;ix Days &s;o.

<P N="46">XLVI. The&s;e <HI>Elliptical</HI> Orbits of Comets, if they be &s;uch, are &s;o very Oblong and Ecc$ntrical, that while they come within our Ob&s;ervation, they are but little different from <HI>Parabola</HI>'s, and may accordingly be con&s;ider'd as &s;uch.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. The Planes in which various Comets move, are them&s;elves exceeding various, and at all imaginable Angles of Inclination with one another, and with that of the Ecliptick; they all &s;till pa&s;&s;ing through the Center of the Sun.</P>

<P>Corollary 1. <HI>From the&s;e two la&s;t</HI> Lemmata <HI>'tis evident that Comets move &s;ometimes from</HI> Ea&s;t <HI>to</HI> We&s;t, <HI>other times from</HI> We&s;t <HI>to</HI> Ea&s;t; <HI>&s;ometimes from</HI> North <HI>to</HI> South, <HI>other times from</HI> South <HI>to</HI> North; <HI>or obliquely between any of the&s;e ways, ac|cording as the Situation of the Planes of their Or|bits, and the Directions of their Cour&s;es together determine them.</HI></P>

If a Comet in its De&s;cent to, or A&s;cent from the <HI>Sun</HI>, approach near to a Planet as it pa&s;&s;es by, and its Plane be different from that in which the Planet moves; by its attractive Power it will, agreeably to the univer&s;al Law of Gravitation of Bodies, draw it from the Plane in which it before mov'd, and &s;o cau&s;e it afterward to move in a new one, inclin'd to the former, but pa&s;&s;ing thro' the <HI>Sun</HI>, as the former did.</P>
<P>Corollary. <HI>Hence 'tis &s;uppo&s;able, that tho' the Planets originally revolv'd in the &s;ame common Plane, yet by the &s;ub&s;equent Attraction of Comets, their Planes may now be inclin'd to one another, and dif|ferent; as 'tis certain</HI> de facto <HI>they now are</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Scholium.</HI> Seeing the Law of Gravitation is uni|ver&s;al and mutual, 'tis evident the Planet would draw the Comet from its Plane, as well as the Co|met would draw the Planet; and &s;o generally, what Effects &s;oever the Comets could have on the Pla|nets, the latter would have corre&s;pondent ones on the former. But as this Indication once given for all, there is no Nece&s;&s;ity of taking notice of the Changes in the Comets; &s;o accordingly, in what follows, I &s;hall wholly omit the &s;ame; and con|fine my &s;elf to &s;uch Things as will be immedi|ately u&s;eful in the following Theory.</P>
<P N="51">LI.

For when the original Velocity of B was exactly adju&s;ted to the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Power of Attraction, and its Orbit there|upon a perfect Circle, this new Acceleration or Retardation mu&s;t render it afterward incommen|&s;urate, and too great, or too little for the &s;ame; and accordingly the Orbit to be afterward, agree|ably to what has been formerly explain'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. 11, 12, 13. prius.</NOTE> de|&s;crib'd by the Planet, mu&s;t be an <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI>; and big|ger or le&s;s than the former Circle, as the Force was directed for, or again&s;t, the Planets own Motion.</P>
<P>Corollary 1. <HI>In this Ca&s;e, the</HI> Sun <HI>would no lon|ger be in the Center of the Figure, but in one of the</HI> Foci, viz. <HI>in the nearer</HI> Focus <HI>of the larger, and the farther of the &s;maller</HI> Ellip&s;is.</P>

<P N="52">LII. If a Comet in pa&s;&s;ing by as before, accele|rate the Planet's Motion, and &s;o enlarge the Orbit, the Planet's periodical Time of revolving will be enlarg'd, and become longer thereby.

And &s;till the more con&s;iderable the Acceleration or Re|tardation
<PB N="43" REF="149">
is, compar'd with the original Velocity of the Planet, the greater will be the Eccentri|city, and the greater Difference between the for|mer and latter Orbits, and the former and latter periodical Times of revolving al&s;o.</P>
<P>Corollary 1. <HI>If in the foregoing Ca&s;e the Semidi|ameter of the ancient Circle, with the middle Di&s;tance in the</HI> Ellip&s;is <HI>afterward de&s;crib'd be given, as al&s;o the periodical Time of revolving in the latter, the perio|dical Time of revolving in the former is at the &s;ame time determin'd.

<P>Coroll. 2. <HI>Since therefore the three</HI> Po&s;tulata <HI>now mention'd are given in the Ca&s;e of the Earth (&s;up|po&s;ing that it anciently revolv'd in a circular Orbit) as will hereafter appear; the Time of its annual Revolution in that original and circular Orbit may ea&s;ily be at this Day di&s;cover'd.</HI></P>
<P N="53">LIII. If a Planet moving in a circular Orbit, were accelerated by an Attraction directly along its Tangent or Periphery; the preceding Angle made by the Tangent and Radius CBA,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 3.</NOTE> would &s;till remain a right one, and the Point B, where the Acceleration happen'd, would afterward be the neare&s;t to the <HI>Focus</HI>, or the <HI>Perihelion</HI> in the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> afterward to be de&s;crib'd.

The Cour&s;e of the Sun and Planets, (for the fix'd Stars were then <HI>Fix'd</HI> indeed; having neither a Real nor Seeming Motion) mu&s;t be contrary to what it has appear'd &s;ince: Their Ri|&s;ing being then in the <HI>We&s;t</HI>, and their Setting in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>; which, from the way of the pre&s;ent Diurnal Rotation, has &s;ince, as all know, been quite different.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) There mu&s;t be a perpetual Equinox, or Equality of Day and Night, through the whole Planet; by rea&s;on of the Sun's de&s;cribing each Revolution a great Circle about the &s;ame, on which alone &s;uch an Equality depends.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The Ecliptick mu&s;t &s;upply the Place of an Equator al&s;o; and the Torrid, Temperate, and Frigid Zones be almo&s;t alike di&s;pos'd with regard to that Circle, as with us they are with regard to the real Equator.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) To &s;uch as liv'd under or near the &s;aid Ecliptick, the Poles of the World or Ecliptick, the only ones then in Being, would be at or near the Horizon; and &s;o not con&s;iderably elevated or depre&s;s'd to the Inhabitants there. But upon the commencing of a quicker Diurnal Rotation, the
<PB N="59" REF="165">
&s;ame way with the Annual, the Ca&s;e would be in all the&s;e Particulars quite different. For,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) By rea&s;on of the Quickne&s;s of the new Diurnal, in compari&s;on of the Ancient and Con|tinued Annual Revolution, <HI>Days</HI> and <HI>Years</HI> would be entirely di&s;tinct Spaces of Time: The Sun re|turning to the &s;ame Meridian very often, while (from one Tropick to another, and &s;o to the &s;ame again) he appear'd to have compleated his longer annual Period.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) By the Diurnal Rotation of the Planet from <HI>We&s;t</HI> to <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>, the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Revolution of the Sun, of the other Planets, and of all the Heavenly Bodies, would be from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t</HI>; and they would all Ri&s;e at the former, and Set at the latter Part of the Horizon.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The perpetual Equinox would be confin'd to the Equatorial Parts of the Planet; and all other Countries would have longer Days in Sum|mer, and &s;horter in Winter, as now obtains in the World; when only <HI>March</HI> 10, and <HI>Septem|ber</HI> 12, have Day and Night equal to each other through the whole Earth.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The Ecliptick and Equator would be en|tirely different; the latter a real Circle, or Line, on the Planet, equally di&s;tant from its own pro|per Poles; the former confin'd to the Heavens, and not, with re&s;pect to the Planet, ea&s;ily to be taken notice of. The Torrid, Temperate, and Frigid Zones would regard the new Equator, and be from it di&s;tingui&s;h'd and di&s;pos'd almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner as before they were from the Eclip|tick, and that with greater Nicene&s;s, and more exact Boundaries.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) The Poles of the World, which before were to the Inhabitants near the ancient Ecliptick, neither con&s;iderably elevated nor depre&s;s'd, but
<PB N="60" REF="166">
&s;ituate near the Horizon, would &s;eem entirely chang'd, and particularly at the Inter&s;ection of &s;uch ancient Ecliptick, and the &s;ucceeding <HI>Nor|thern</HI> Tropick, the <HI>Northern</HI> Pole would appear to be elevated above, the <HI>Southern</HI> depre&s;s'd below the Horizon; and the Sun and Planets, who&s;e Motions were before either exactly or nearly over the <HI>Vertex</HI>, and &s;o at or almo&s;t at right Angles, the Horizon would appear inclin'd or bent to|wards the <HI>Southern</HI> Parts; and that way become oblique, and at plainly unequal Angles with the Horizon for ever after.</P>
<P>Corollary 1. <HI>To the Inhabitants of that Place la&s;t mention'd, the Beginning of the Night, and of the Autumn, or Sun-&s;et, and the Autumnal Equinox, would in &s;uch a primitive State of a Planet, be either exactly or nearly coincident: And</HI> vice ver|s&acirc;, <HI>the Place to which they were &s;o coincident, was that Inter&s;ection ju&s;t now a&s;&s;ign'd, or at lea&s;t under the &s;ame Meridian therewith</HI>.</P>
<P>Coroll. 2. <HI>Such a Planet would be more equally habitable in the &s;econd, than in the fir&s;t State. For, from the &s;pherical Figure of the Planet at fir&s;t, the Central Hot Body,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Arg. 7. Hypoth. 1. infra.</NOTE> <HI>(of which hereafter) would equally reach all the Regions; and the Sun chiefly affect the Torrid Zone; and &s;till le&s;s the Temperate, but lea&s;t of all the Frigid ones; as he does at pre&s;ent. So that if any one of the&s;e Climates, by rea&s;on of the due Proportion of Heat afforded it from the Sun, were habitable, neither of the other could with any &s;ort of Equality be &s;o too. But when the Figure of the Planet became an</HI> oblate Sphaeroid, <HI>(as on the commencing of the Diurnal Rotation we have &s;hew'd it would;) the Proportion of Heat would be upon the whole more equable through the &s;everal Climates of the Planet; the greater Vicinity of the Central Hot Body to the Frigid Zones, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure $span$ the $span$ $ne&s;s of the Sun's

Pe&s;ition to the Torrid one; and rendring the com|pleat Surface of the Planet &s;omewhat more univer|&s;ally habitable on account thereof</HI>.</P>
<P>Coroll. 3. <HI>Where the States of External Nature are &s;o very different (as on the &s;ame Planet before and after its Diurnal Rotation begin, they appear to be;) 'tis rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Natures, Con&s;titu|tions, and Circum&s;tances of Creatures, which were the Inhabitants in &s;uch different States, mu&s;t be &s;uit|ably and proportionably different from one another.</HI></P>
<P>Coroll. 4. <HI>'Tis therefore, without due Allowance for every thing, very un&s;afe arguing from one State or its Circum&s;tances to another; and very unju&s;t to conclude Things unaccountable or ab&s;urd in one, only becau&s;e they are &s;trange and unknown to the other State. The like is to be &s;aid of Phra&s;es, De&s;cripti|ons, or Relations concerning one, which may ea&s;ily be mi&s;under&s;tood in the other, without an exact Con|&s;ideration and Allowance for the Diver&s;ity of Things belonging thereto.</HI></P>
<P N="74">LXXIV. If the Atmo&s;phere of a Comet, or any other &s;uch a fluid, confu&s;ed <HI>Chaos</HI>, were by a regu|lar and orderly Dige&s;tion and Sub&s;idence brought into a con&s;i&s;tent and durable State; the univer&s;al Law of &s;pecifick Gravity mu&s;t prevail, and each Ma&s;s take its Place, generally &s;peaking, according to it, (whether 'twere fluid or &s;olid) from the Center to the Circumference of the whole.</P>
<P N="75">LXXV. Fluids are at lea&s;t as capable of all De|grees of Den&s;ity and &s;pecifick Gravity, as Solids. Thus the Proportion of the heavie&s;t and lighte&s;t Fluids, Quick&s;ilver, and Oil, are nearly as fif|teen and one; when yet the Proportion of the heavie&s;t Solid, Gold, and the lighte&s;t Earth or Mold which we find here, is not quite as ten to one. On which account, 'tis highly rea&s;onable to allow, that po&s;&s;ibly there may be as much Variety

and Diver&s;ity in the Fluids belonging to a Pla|net, as we &s;ee there is in the Solids thereof.</P>
<P>Corollary. <HI>From the&s;e two la&s;t</HI> Lemmata, <HI>it ap|pears as rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e a great Part of the in|ternal Con&s;titution of a Planet to be a Fluid, or Sy&s;tem of Fluids, as to be a Solid or Sy&s;tem of firm and earthly</HI> Strata, <HI>which yet is u&s;ually &s;uppos'd; and which of the&s;e</HI> Hypothe&s;es <HI>be&s;t &s;uits the Con&s;titution of the Original</HI> Chaos, <HI>and the</HI> Phaenomena <HI>of Na|ture afterward, is in rea&s;on to be embrac'd</HI>.</P>
<P N="76">LXXVI. In the regular Formation of a Planet from a <HI>Chaos</HI>, it mu&s;t be much more rare and un|u&s;ual to lodge very heavy Fluids near the &s;uperfici|ary Regions, among Bodies of a lighter and rarer Texture, than Solids equally &s;o. For the Cor|pu&s;cles of very den&s;e and heavy Solids, when they are once entangled among, and mix'd with others, tho' of very different Den&s;ity and &s;pecifick Gra|vity, mu&s;t afterward (let the Place proper for Bodies of their Weight be never &s;o much nearer the Center,) lye according to their fir&s;t ca&s;ual Situ|ation. Thus if you take Du&s;t of Gold, Silver, or Bra&s;s, with Sand, Gravel, or Saw-du&s;t, and mix them, or let them &s;ub&s;ide indifferently together, as they place them&s;elves at fir&s;t, &s;o, notwith&s;tand|ing their different Weight, will they be &s;ituate ever after. But in Fluids the Ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e, for they will obtain their due Place, not only when mix'd with Fluids, but with any &s;olid Corpu&s;cles what&s;oever. Nay, be&s;ides that, they will penetrate the Inter&s;tices of Bodies heavier than them&s;elves; and unle&s;s where tho&s;e Bodies are firmly con&s;oli|dated or conjoin'd together, will &s;ettle into, and fill up the &s;ame, without any regard to the Situation according to &s;pecifick Gravity. Fluids are compos'd of moveable, &s;eparable Parts, diffu&s;ing, &s;ub&s;iding, and flowing every where, and thereby will be &s;o
<PB N="63" REF="169">
far from re&s;ting at Regions too high and remote from the Center, con&s;idering their &s;pecifick Gra|vity, that how light &s;oever they are, unle&s;s the earthy Parts under them be either fix'd and con&s;o|lidated, or their Inter&s;tices already entirely fill'd and &s;atur'd, they will in&s;inuate them&s;elves, and by degrees approach as near as po&s;&s;ible to the Center of that Planet to which they belong.</P>
<P>Corollary 1. <HI>Tho' our Earth &s;hould contain va&s;t Quantities of den&s;e and heavy Fluids within, as well as like den&s;e and heavy Solids; yet 'tis more &s;trange that we have near the Surface one</HI> Specimen <HI>of the former,</HI> (viz. Quick&s;ilver) <HI>than that we have &s;o many Sorts, and &s;o much larger Quantities of the latter (the Mineral and Metallick Bodies) much den&s;er and heavier than that common Earth among which they are found</HI>.</P>
<P>Coroll. 2. <HI>No Argument can be drawn from the Variety of den&s;e and heavy Solids, and the &s;ingle In|&s;tance of den&s;e and heavy Fluids, to prove the Impro|bability of a &s;ubterraneous, den&s;e and heavy Fluid, or Sy&s;tem of Fluids, on who&s;e Surface our Orb of Earth may be &s;uppos'd to rely; if the other</HI> Phaeno|mena <HI>of Nature require &s;uch an</HI> Hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P N="77">LXXVII. If a <HI>Chaos</HI> were chiefly compos'd of a den&s;e Fluid, of greater &s;pecifick Gravity than its &s;olid, dry, or earthy Parts, the Place of &s;uch a den&s;e Fluid upon regular Formation, would be neare&s;t the Center, and the &s;olid or earthy Ma&s;s would encompa&s;s it round, enclo&s;e it within it &s;elf, and re&s;t upon its Surface; and <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;</HI>, if an Orb of Earth be &s;ituate on the Surface of a Fluid, that Fluid is den&s;er and heavier than the entire Columns of &s;uch an Orb of Earth con&s;i|der'd together.</P>
<P N="78">LXXVIII. If a Solid be either contain'd in, or fall upon a Fluid of greater &s;pecifick Gravity than

it &s;elf, it will neither &s;ink to the Bottom, &s;ub&s;ide entirely within, nor emerge quite out of the &s;ame; but Part of it remaining immers'd, the other Part will be extant above the Surface of the Fluid; and that in a different Degree, proporti|onably to the different &s;pecifick Gravity of the Solid, compar'd with that of the Fluid.</P>
<P N="79">LXXIX. Such a Solid will continue to that certain Depth immers'd in the Fluid before-men|tion'd, that if the Space taken up thereby were fill'd with the Fluid, that Portion of the Fluid were exactly equal in Weight to the whole Solid. Thus, if a Cube of Wood or Bra&s;s were immers'd in a Fluid of twice its &s;pecifick Gravity, it would one half &s;ub&s;ide within, and the other half be ex|tant above the Surface of the Fluid. If it were im|mers'd in a Fluid of thrice its &s;pecifick Gravity, two thirds of it would be extant, and but a third Part inclos'd within the &s;aid Surface, and &s;uitably hereto in all other Proportions what&s;oever. The&s;e two Propo&s;itions are demon&s;trated by <HI>Archimedes</HI>, and are the known Foundations of <HI>Hydro&s;taticks</HI>.</P>
<P N="80">LXXX. If therefore &s;olid Bodies, equal in vi|&s;ible Bulk, or taking up equal Spaces, but of un|equal Den&s;ity and &s;pecifick Gravity, re&s;t upon the Surface of a Fluid den&s;er and heavier than them|&s;elves, they mu&s;t remain immers'd in the &s;ame in different Degrees; the heavie&s;t &s;inking deepe&s;t, and the lighte&s;t being the mo&s;t extant above the Fluid. Thus, if &s;ix &s;everal Cubes of equal apparent Mag|nitude, made of Gold, Lead, Silver, Bra&s;s, Iron, and Stone, were laid upon the &s;ame Fluid den&s;er and heavier than any of them, every one &s;everally would &s;ink &s;o much deeper as it was heavier, and thereby the upper Surface ari&s;ing from them all, become very unequal.</P>
<P N="81"><PB N="65" REF="171">LXXXI.

But if, on the contrary, the Quantity of dry, &s;olid, or earthy Parts be va&s;tly greater than of the liquid or fluid ones, the Surface will be rugged and un|even, by the different Degree of the Immer&s;ion of the different Columns thereof, in that den&s;e Fluid or Aby&s;s upon which the Orb is plac'd.</P>
<P>Corollary 1. <HI>In the former Ca&s;e all the Corpu&s;cles will obtain their proper Place, (the Fluidity freely permitting their Pa&s;&s;age,) according to their re&s;pe|ctive &s;pecifick Gravity. But in the latter they mu&s;t take their Places rather according as they chanc'd to be before &s;ituate, than according as their &s;pecifick Gravity would of it &s;elf determine them.

<P>Coroll. 2. <HI>If therefore the upper Regions of a</HI> Chaos, <HI>who&s;e Quantity of Liquid is very &s;mall in com|pari&s;on of its &s;olid Corpu&s;cles, do &s;ub&s;ide into a Fluid

of greater &s;pecifick Gravity than its own Columns ta|ken together are, an Orb of Earth will be compos'd on the Surface of the Fluid; and its different Columns being made up of Bodies of very different Natures and &s;pecifick Gravities, (as mu&s;t happen in &s;uch a confu&s;ed heterogeneous Ma&s;s, as we call a</HI> Chaos, <HI>particularly the Atmo&s;phere of a Comet;) that Orb will &s;ink into the Fluid in different Degrees; and thereby render its Surface unequal, or di&s;tingui&s;hed into Mountains, Plains, and Vallies. So that by how much any Column was compos'd of rarer, more porous, and lighter Bodies, by &s;o much would it pro|duce a higher Mountain; and in like manner, by how much a Column was compos'd of more clo&s;e, fix'd, den&s;e and &s;olid Bodies, by &s;o much would it produce a lower Valley; and &s;o</HI> vice vers&acirc;, <HI>the higher any Moun|tain, the more rare, porous, and light its Column; and the lower any Valley, the more fix'd, clo&s;e, den&s;e, and &s;olid its Column mu&s;t needs be &s;uppos'd.</HI></P>

<P N="1">(1.) The Names of the&s;e two Bodies, or Sy|&s;tems of Bodies, are exactly the &s;ame, and equal|ly agreeable to the Nature of each of them. The Original <HI>Chaos</HI>, by the Ancient Tradition of the <HI>Phaenicians</HI>, was &s;til'd, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; in <HI>Engli&s;h, A dark and &s;tormy Atmo&s;phere</HI>. Which Appellation, (the con&s;tant Character of that Ma&s;s encompa&s;&s;ing the Body of a Comet, and at the &s;ame time of the old <HI>Chaos</HI>) if we &s;uppo&s;e it to have been as fitly by Antiquity apply'd to the latter, as certainly, Ob&s;ervation be|ing
<PB N="74" REF="180">
Judge, it is to the former; is as proper a one for our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, as could po&s;&s;ibly be de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The main Bulk of the ancient <HI>Chaos</HI>, and of the Atmo&s;phere of a Comet, is a Fluid, or Sy|&s;tem of Fluids. As to the former, 'tis both nece&s;|&s;ary to be pre&s;uppos'd in order to the &s;ucceeding Separation, and regular Di&s;po&s;ition of the Parts; and is confirm'd by all the Accounts of it. But <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf being expre&s;s, I &s;hall content my &s;elf with his &s;ingle Te&s;timony; who not only calls it an <HI>Aby&s;s</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.2.</NOTE> but gives it the Stile of <HI>Waters. Darkne&s;s was upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters</HI>. Now, that the main Part of a Comet's Atmo&s;phere is al&s;o a Fluid, appears both by its Pellucidne&s;s, (a thing unu&s;ual in Bodies, but &s;uch as are, or once were in a fluid Condition) and by tho&s;e perpetual Changes and Agitations of Parts with|in the Regions of it, which in any other than a Fluid are plainly impo&s;&s;ible; and which indeed, withal, have hitherto &s;eem'd &s;o vi&s;ible and re|markable, that thence Men were ready to imagine the whole Ma&s;s to be nothing el&s;e but a Congeries of Vapours or Clouds, uncertainly jumbled toge|ther, and as uncertainly di&s;&s;ipated again.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The <HI>Chaos</HI> is de&s;crib'd to have been very &s;tormy and tempe&s;tuous; of which &s;ome of the ancient Writers take particular notice. To which tho&s;e frequent and violent Agitations and Chan|ges, tho&s;e &s;trange, uncertain Hurries of Opake Ma&s;&s;es hither and thither, which the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Comets Atmo&s;pheres pre&s;ent us with, mo&s;t exactly agree.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The <HI>Chaos</HI> was a mixed Compound of all Sorts of Corpu&s;cles, in a mo&s;t uncertain confus'd and di&s;orderly State; heavy and light, den&s;e and
<PB N="75" REF="181">
rare, fluid and &s;olid Particles were in a great mea|&s;ure, as it were at a Venture, mingled and jumbled together. The Atoms, or &s;mall con&s;tituent Parts of Air, Water and Earth, (to which, together with Fire, the Name of <HI>Element</HI> has been peculiar|ly apply'd) every one were in every Place, and all in a wild di&s;turb'd Confu&s;ion. This is the very E&s;&s;ence, and enters the Definition of a <HI>Chaos</HI>; in which therefore all both do, and mu&s;t agree. And if any one carefully con&s;iders the perpetually various Vi&s;age of a Comet's Atmo&s;phere, its va&s;t Extent, the no manner of Order or Method of its &s;everal Appearances, and remembers that in &s;ome Comets it has in its near Approach to the <HI>Sun</HI>, been &s;corch'd and burn'd by a Degree of Heat ma|ny hundred times as Inten&s;e as the <HI>Sun</HI>'s is with us in the mid&s;t of <HI>Summer</HI>, he will not wonder that I a&s;&s;ert the Parts of this Atmo&s;phere to be in a perfectly confus'd and <HI>Chaotick</HI> Condition. One might indeed as well, and as rea&s;onably, expect Order and Method in the ruinous Relicks of a City burnt to A&s;hes, or in the Smoke proceeding from the &s;ame, as in &s;everal, at lea&s;t, of tho&s;e Atmo&s;pheres we are &s;peaking of.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) The ancient <HI>Chaos</HI>, ju&s;t before the Begin|ning of the &s;ix Days Creation, was very dark and caliginous.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.2.</NOTE> <HI>Darkne&s;s was upon the face of the deep</HI>, &s;ays the &s;acred, and the very &s;ame &s;ay the prophane Writers. Now, when we every Year &s;ee how far that &s;mall Company of collected Va|pours, of which a Cloud con&s;i&s;ts, can go towards cau&s;ing Darkne&s;s on the Face of the Earth; we may ea&s;ily gue&s;s how thick the Darkne&s;s of the Comet's Atmo&s;phere mu&s;t needs be, when all tho&s;e earthy and watery Corpu&s;cles, which flying up and down in the va&s;t Regions thereof, do now &s;o often, and &s;o much ob&s;cure the Comet's central Bo|dy,
<PB N="76" REF="182">
and are here &s;o very &s;en&s;ible; when all the&s;e, I &s;ay, &s;hall ri&s;e up, and make a confus'd cloudy Orb on the more confin'd Surface of the Atmo&s;phere of many &s;cores, if not hundreds of Miles thick; as mu&s;t happen in the Beginning of its Forma|tion. If this be not &s;ufficient to account for this thick <HI>Darkne&s;s on the Face of the Aby&s;s</HI>, I know not what can. So that if we refer the words of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to the proper and peculiar Time only, when they are introduc'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That ju&s;t before the Be|ginning of the &s;ix Days Creation, that Place of the <HI>Chaos</HI> where afterward the Earth's Surface and the Air was, had Darkne&s;s on its Face; we have &s;ufficiently here already accounted for it. But if we &s;uppo&s;e that the Darkne&s;s refers al&s;o to all the ancient Time <HI>prior</HI> to this Creation, and thence object, that the Atmo&s;phere of a Comet, which is a tran&s;parent Fluid, and illuminated continually, cannot be that dark <HI>Chaos</HI> in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>; I an&s;wer, That tho' indeed,
<Q>&startq;All the upper Part of the Atmo&s;phere of a Comet, thro' which we &s;ee the fixed Stars, is tran&s;parent, yet the lowe&s;t Part next the <HI>Nucleus</HI>, or den&s;e Body, &s;eems to be opake and dark like a very thick Mi&s;t, &s;o as to hide the <HI>Nucleus</HI> it &s;elf from our Sight, and cau&s;e <HI>Darkne&s;s upon the Face of the Deep</HI>. For the Changes which &s;ome ob&s;erve in the <HI>Nucleus</HI> of Comets are to be &s;uppos'd not in the &s;olid Body, but in the cloudy Bottom of the Atmo&s;phere, which next encompa&s;&s;es the <HI>Nu|cleus</HI>. And this <HI>Darkne&s;s upon the Face of the Deep</HI>, might continue till the Comet was grown cold, and all the den&s;er Part of the Atmo|&s;phere was &s;ub&s;ided; and be greate&s;t while tho&s;e den&s;er Parts were in a State of coagulating and &s;ub&s;iding; <HI>i. e.</HI> at the particular Time di|rectly &endq;referr'd to in the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory.</Q></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="77" REF="183">(6.) Our upper Earth, the Product of the an|cient <HI>Chaos</HI>, being in all Probability founded on a den&s;e Fluid or Aby&s;s, as will appear in the Se|quel, the main Part of the Fluid of that ancient <HI>Chaos</HI>, mu&s;t, by con&s;equence, have been &s;uch a den&s;e and heavy one as is here mention'd. And indeed, 'tis in it &s;elf but very rea&s;onable, if not nece&s;&s;ary, to allow the inferior Parts of a fluid <HI>Chaos</HI> to have been compos'd of much den&s;er and heavier Ma&s;&s;es than the &s;uperior, or than Water, the main vi&s;ible Fluid of our Globe. For, if we con&s;ider the Matter in any &s;ort according to the Law of &s;pecifick Gravity, all heavy Fluids mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, as certainly be near the Center, as like heavy Solids; and 'tis but mechanical to al|low that in a confus'd Fluid <HI>in &s;ome mea&s;ure</HI>, as well as <HI>exactly</HI> in a dige&s;ted one, the Fluids con|tain'd in the inner Regions mu&s;t be much hea|vier than tho&s;e at or near the outer Surface there|of. But be&s;ides, 'twill be hard to account for the confus'd moving State of the earthy Parts, or, which is much the &s;ame, the Fluidity of the en|tire <HI>Chaos</HI>, without allowing a much greater Quantity of Fluids in it, than what we now &s;ee with us, the Waters of our pre&s;ent Earth; and tho&s;e of a Den&s;ity and Gravity fit to retain their Po&s;ts, as well nearer the central, as the &s;uper|ficiary Parts. And that on this Account, (of the Comet's Atmo&s;phere's fix'd and den&s;e Fluid) 'tis peculiarly adapted to the afore&s;aid De&s;cription of the <HI>Chaos</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coroll. <HI>2.</HI> Lem. <HI>68.</HI> prius.</NOTE> is evident by what has been already ob&s;erv'd of the &s;ame; to which I refer the <HI>Reader</HI> for Satisfaction.</P>

or internal Heat diffu&s;ing warm and vigorous Steams every way from the Center to the Circum|ference of the Earth; and whereas 'tis very dif|ficult on the common <HI>Hypothe&s;es</HI>, or indeed on any hitherto taken notice of, to give a Mechani|cal and Philo&s;ophical Solution of the &s;ame; If we will but allow the Propo&s;ition we are now upon, that the Earth, in its <HI>Chaotick</HI> State, was a Comet, a mo&s;t ea&s;y and Mechanical Account thereof is hereby given, and the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature render'd plain and intelligible. For a Co|met, be&s;ides its thinner fluid Atmo&s;phere, con|&s;i&s;ting of a large, den&s;e, &s;olid, &s;pherical Body, [or <HI>Load&s;tone</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. <HI>Lem.</HI> 68. <HI>prius</HI>.</NOTE>] and &s;ometimes approaching &s;o near the <HI>Sun</HI>, that the Heat acquir'd then, though &s;ooner failing in the thinner and expos'd Atmo&s;phere, will not do &s;o in the central &s;olid, under very many thou&s;ands of Years; nothing can better &s;uit the Ca&s;e of our pre&s;ent Earth, than to allow a Comet't Atmo&s;phere to have been her <HI>Chaos</HI>; and the central Body of the Comet, the Source and Origin of that central Heat, which our Earth appears &s;till to inclo&s;e within it.</P>
<P>However, it mu&s;t here be ob&s;erv'd, that altho' with &s;ome, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> before hinted at to be accountable without any internal Heat, yet will not this di&s;agree with the pre&s;ent <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, that the Earth was once a Co|met; becau&s;e &s;ome Comets approach &s;o very near the <HI>Sun</HI>, (as that famous one in 1680, 1681.) that their central Solids mu&s;t be exceeding hot, and retain the &s;ame a long Time; and others (as that in 1664) de&s;cend not &s;o low as the <HI>Orbis Magnus</HI> of the Earth, and &s;o are never heated &s;o much as our Earth is in Summer; and therefore tho' the Acknowledgment of a vigorous central Heat is a great Argument that the Earth was once a Co|met,
<PB N="79" REF="185">
as &s;olving what is otherwi&s;e in&s;oluble, yet is not the Denial of the &s;ame any Argument again&s;t it: Becau&s;e it may as ea&s;ily be &s;uppos'd to have been one of tho&s;e who&s;e central Solids would not be &s;o violently heated, as one of tho&s;e which would have been &s;o.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) The Bigne&s;s of Comets and of their At|mo&s;pheres, agrees exactly with the Suppo&s;ition we are now upon. For tho' the Atmo&s;pheres are 10,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lem.</HI> 60, 61. <HI>prius</HI>.</NOTE> or perhaps 15 times in Diameter as big as the central Bodies, (which yet have been formerly ob&s;erv'd to be near the Magnitude of the Planets) and thereby of a much larger Capacity than this Argument &s;uppo&s;es; yet if, from that thin, rare, expanded State in which they now are, they were &s;uppos'd to &s;ub&s;ide or &s;ettle clo&s;e together, and immediately re&s;t upon the central Body; as on a Formation they mu&s;t do; the entire Ma&s;s would make much &s;uch Bodies in Magnitude, as the Planets are: As A&s;tronomers, from the Ob&s;erva|tions made about them, will readily confe&s;s. So that when, to all the other Inducements to believe the&s;e Atmo&s;pheres to be the &s;ame Ma&s;&s;es of Bo|dies we call <HI>Chaos's</HI>, (from one of which all An|tiquity, &s;acred and prophane, derive the Origin of our Earth;) it appears that the Magnitude is al&s;o exactly corre&s;pondent; I know not what can be alledg'd to take off or weaken the Force of them. Which general Conclu&s;ion might be confirm'd by &s;ome other Similitudes between them and the Pla|nets, ob&s;ervable in the &s;ucceeding Theory, or probably deduc'd from their <HI>Phaenomena</HI>; which I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent in&s;i&s;t particularly upon. So that on the whole Matter, upon the Credit of the foregoing Arguments united together, and con|&s;piring to the &s;ame Conclu&s;ion; I may, I think, venture to affirm, That as far as hitherto pre&s;ent
<PB N="80" REF="186">
Nature and Ancient Traditions are known; 'tis very rea&s;onable to believe, that a <HI>Planet</HI> is a <HI>Co|met</HI> form'd into a regular and la&s;ting Con&s;titution, and plac'd at a proper Di&s;tance from the Sun in a <HI>Circular</HI> Orbit, or one very little Eccentrical; and a <HI>Comet</HI> is a <HI>Chaos, i. e.</HI> a <HI>Planet</HI> unform'd, or in its primaeval State, plac'd in a very <HI>Eccen|trical</HI> one: And I think I may fairly appeal to all that the mo&s;t Ancient Hi&s;tory, or Solid Philo|&s;ophy can produce hereto relating, in Atte&s;tati|on to &s;uch an A&s;&s;ertion. E&s;pecially con&s;idering withal,</P>

Now this I am &s;ecure of, and all will and mu&s;t grant: They cannot but be forc'd to confe&s;s, that (the Atmo&s;phere of a Comet &s;et a&s;ide) they have no other <HI>Idea</HI> of the Nature and Properties of that Ma&s;s of Bodies call'd a <HI>Chaos</HI>, but what prophane Tradition, with the Concurrence of the Holy Books, afford them; without any vi&s;ible In&s;tance or Pattern in Nature.

<P N="2">II. The Mountainous Columns of the Earth are not &s;o den&s;e or heavy as the other Columns.</P>
<P>This Propo&s;ition will al&s;o, I imagine, be new and unexpected to very many; but I hope the following Arguments, which I &s;hall very briefly propo&s;e, will prove it to be no unrea&s;onable or precarious one.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Mountains, &s;o far as we can penetrate into them, [at lea&s;t if ever we do penetrate into the true Antediluvian Mountains them&s;elves; which is al&s;o to be &s;uppos'd in &s;ome other Arguments] are u&s;ually &s;tony and rocky, and by con&s;equence lighter than the main Body of the Earth. For tho' Stone be &s;omewhat heavier than the upper|mo&s;t <HI>Stratum</HI> or <HI>Garden Mould</HI>, as &s;ome &s;tile it; yet 'tis con&s;iderably lighter than that beneath the &s;ame. For if we compare its Weight with that in
<PB N="83" REF="189">
the Bottom of our Mines, which is alone con&s;i|derable to our Purpo&s;e, (our upper <HI>Strata</HI>, as will hereafter appear, being generally factitious, or acquir'd at the Univer&s;al Deluge) we &s;hall be forc'd to own the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Con&s;equence of the pre&s;ent Argument. The Specifick Gravi|ty of Stone is to that of Water, as 14 to 5&frac13;, but the Specifick Gravity of the Earth at the Bottom of our Mines is to that of Wa|ter as 3 to 1, &s;ometimes as 4 to 1, nay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Newt. p. <HI>417.</HI></NOTE> &s;ome|times almo&s;t as 5 to 1, and therefore to be &s;ure con&s;iderably den&s;er and heavier than Stone: So that were the Mountainous Columns of the Earth entirely made up of Stone, they would (without the Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e empty Caverns they enclo&s;e) be plainly the lighte&s;t Parts of the whole Earth.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Tho&s;e very den&s;e and heavy Corpu&s;cles of Gold, Lead, Silver, and other &s;uch like Me|tals and Minerals, are mo&s;tly, if not only, found in the Bowels of Mountains. Now, &s;ince the Gravity of the&s;e Bodies is &s;o great, that in a re|gular Formation they ought to have &s;eated them|&s;elves, one would think, much nearer the Center than they now are; to account for &s;uch their Po|&s;ition, it mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd, that the Columns un|der them, and the Earth among them, were lighter and rarer than the neighbouring Columns did af|ford; that upon the whole, the entire <HI>Compo&s;itum</HI> or Ma&s;s taken together, may be allow'd to be, if not lighter, yet, at lea&s;t, not heavier than that of any other Column. So that by a ju&s;t, tho' a little &s;urprizing way of Rea&s;oning, from the greater &s;pecifick Gravity of &s;ome Parts of the Mountainous Columns, the le&s;s &s;pecifick Gravity of the whole is inferr'd.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Mountains are the principal Source and O|rigin of Springs and Fountains.<NOTE PLACE="marg">E&s;&s;ay, Part 3.</NOTE> Now Dr. <HI>Wood|ward</HI>,
<PB N="84" REF="190">
from his own Ob&s;ervations, a&s;&s;erts, That the&s;e are neither wholly deriv'd from Vapours condens'd in the Air at the Tops of Mountains, nor from mere Rains, or Fall of Moi&s;ture, as &s;e|veral have differently a&s;&s;erted; but from the Wa|ters in the Bowels of the Earth; and that 'tis a Steam or Vapour rais'd by the &s;ubterraneous Heat which affords no &s;mall Part of their Waters to them. On which Hypothe&s;is, which I take to be the true&s;t and mo&s;t rational of all others, the Vapours appear to have a more free and open Vent or Current up the Mountainous Columns, than the neighbouring ones; and con&s;equently, they are more rare, lax, and porous, or le&s;s den&s;e and weighty than the others.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) All <HI>Volcano's</HI>, or &s;ubterraneous Fires, are in the Bowels of &s;ome Mountain, to which a Plain or a Valley was never known to be liable. Which Ob&s;ervation affords a double Argument for &s;uch a Levity and Rarene&s;s as we are now contending for; the one, from the Temper of an inflammable Earth, Sulphurous and Bitumi|nous; which being in part made up of oily Par|ticles, the lighte&s;t Fluid we have, mu&s;t in likeli|hood be the lighte&s;t of all <HI>Strata</HI> what&s;oever; the other, from the free Admi&s;&s;ion of Air into the Bowels of the&s;e Mountains; without which no Fire or Flame can be pre&s;erv'd; which al&s;o infers &s;uch a Poro&s;ity or Laxne&s;s as we are now concern'd to prove.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) Mountainous Countries are chiefly &s;ubject to Earthquakes, and con&s;equently are as well Sul|phurous and Inflammable, as Hollow and Caver|nous, Loo&s;e and Spungy in their inward Parts; without which Properties the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Earth|quakes were difficultly accountable: e&s;pecially ac|cording to Dr. <HI>Woodward</HI>'s <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> of them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">E&s;&s;ay. <HI>p.</HI> 134. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> who deriving them from Steams of &s;ubterraneous

Heat a&s;cending from the Central Parts, and col|lected in great Quantities together, mu&s;t by con&s;e|quence own that the Bowels of Mountains, &s;o commonly &s;ubject to Earthquakes, are mo&s;t Per|vious, Porous, and Cavernous of all other. All which Arguments, e&s;pecially taken together with &s;ome other Coincidents hereafter ob&s;ervable, will, I hope, be e&s;teem'd no incon&s;iderable Evidence of the Truth of the Propo&s;ition we are now upon.</P>
<P N="3">III. Though the <HI>Annual Motion</HI> of the Earth commenc'd at the Beginning of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation; yet its <HI>Diurnal Rotation</HI> did not till after the Fall of Man.</P>
<P>Tho' I cannot but expect that this will appear the greate&s;t <HI>Paradox</HI>, and mo&s;t extravagant A&s;&s;er|tion of all other, to not a few Readers; yet I hope to give &s;o great Evidence for the &s;ame from Sacred as well as Prophane Authority, that competent and impartial Judges &s;hall &s;ee Rea&s;on to &s;ay, that if it be not &s;ufficient to force their A&s;&s;ent, yet 'tis &s;uch as they did not expect in &s;o &s;urprizing, remote, and difficult a Ca&s;e; the Records relating to which (the Sacred Ones excepted) are &s;o few, and &s;o dubious; and the con&s;tant Opinion of the World, within the Memory of Hi&s;tory, &s;o fix'd and &s;ettled on the contrary Side. Let it only be, by way of Preparation, remark'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. <HI>69.</HI> pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> that the Annual and Diurnal Motions are in them&s;elves wholly independent on each other, as was before ob|&s;erved; and con&s;equently, that 'tis as rational to &s;uppo&s;e the former without the latter, if there be Evidence for the &s;ame, in the Original State of Nature, as 'tis to believe them capable of being
<PB N="86" REF="192">
conjoin'd, from the known <HI>Phoenomena</HI> of the World, in the pre&s;ent State. Let it al&s;o be ob|&s;erv'd, that there is yet no Evidence that either the central Bodies of any of the Comets, or that even &s;ome of the Planets, which undoubtedly have an Annual Motion about the Sun, have yet any Diurnal Rotation about <HI>Axes</HI> of their own. And let it, la&s;tly, be con&s;ider'd, That &s;ince the Diurnal Rotation mu&s;t have an Original, a Time when it began; that Time may as rationally and naturally be &s;uppos'd after the Fall, as before the Creation, or &s;ix Days Work; and which was the true and real one, mu&s;t be determin'd by the Te|&s;timonies of Antiquity, or other collateral Argu|ments, to be from thence, or from the <HI>Phoenomena</HI> of Nature, ancient or modern, deriv'd and inferr'd. Which Things being &s;uppos'd, I &s;hall thus attempt to prove the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P N="1">(I.) If the primitive State of Nature before the Fall, had tho&s;e peculiar <HI>Phoenomena</HI> or Cha|racters which certainly belong to a Planet before its Diurnal Rotation begun; and are as certainly impo&s;&s;ible in the pre&s;ent State of the Earth revol|ving about its own <HI>Axis</HI>; 'tis plain the A&s;&s;ertion before us is true and real: But that tho&s;e peculiar <HI>Phoenomena</HI> or Characters did belong to that pri|mitive State, the Te&s;timonies of Sacred and Pro|phane Antiquity, to be pre&s;ently produc'd, do make appear; and, by con&s;equence, the A&s;&s;ertion before us is true and real.</P>
<P N="2">(II.) I &s;hall &s;hew, that the pre&s;ent <HI>Phoenomena</HI> of the Earth do prove that its Diurnal Motion did not commence till &s;ome Time after its An|nual, and by con&s;equence, in all Probability, not till after the Fall of Man.</P>
<P N="3">(III.) I &s;hall a&s;&s;ign the probable Mechanical Cau&s;e of this Commencement of the Diurnal Mo|tion,
<PB N="87" REF="193">
after its Annual had continued &s;ome Time; and &s;hew, that that Cau&s;e al&s;o is agreeable to the pre&s;ent <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature, and of the Earth.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t way of Proof, the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> or peculiar di&s;tingui&s;hing Characters here intended, have been already mention'd; and are the&s;e five. (1.) A Day and a Year were all one. (2.) The Sun and Planets ro&s;e in the <HI>We&s;t</HI>, and &s;et in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. <HI>73.</HI> pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> (3.) There was through the whole Earth a per|petual <HI>Equinox</HI>. (4.) The Ecliptick and Equator were all one; or rather, the latter was not in Be|ing, but all the Heavenly Motions were perform'd about the &s;ame invariable <HI>Axis</HI>, that of the for|mer. (5.) To &s;uch as liv'd near the Ecliptick, the Poles of the &s;ame (or of the World, they being then not different) were neither con&s;ide|rably elevated nor depre&s;s'd, but at or near the Horizon. The&s;e are the certain and undeniable Characters of &s;uch a State: And that they be|long'd to the primitive State of our Earth before the Fall, I am now to prove.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) In the primitive State of the World, Days and Years were all one. Which A&s;&s;ertion I en|deavour to evince by the following Arguments. (1.) On this <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, the Letter of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is as exactly follow'd as in the contrary one. 'Tis agreed that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> calls the &s;everal Revolutions of the Sun, in which the Creation was perfected, <HI>Days</HI>, every where in that Hi&s;tory. Now as a <HI>Year</HI> is properly the Succe&s;&s;ion of the four &s;everal Sea&s;ons, Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, ari&s;ing from <HI>one &s;ingle</HI> Revolution of the Earth about the Sun; &s;o a <HI>Day</HI> is the Succe&s;&s;ion of Light and Darkne&s;s <HI>once</HI>; or the Space of <HI>one &s;ingle</HI> apparent Revolution of the Sun from any certain Semimeridian, above or below the Horizon, till its Return thither again. Now, in the Ca&s;e before us, both the&s;e Periods
<PB N="88" REF="194">
are exactly coincident; and both are perform'd in the &s;ame Space of Time: Which Space therefore, in equal Propriety of Speech, belongs to either, or both tho&s;e Names indifferently; and, by con&s;e|quence, may with the exacte&s;t Truth and Propriety be &s;til'd a <HI>Day</HI> or a <HI>Year</HI>. Which Thing duly con&s;i|der'd, if I had no po&s;itive Evidence for the Propo|&s;ition before us, yet, &s;etting a&s;ide Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I had an equal Right and Pretence to Truth with the common Expo&s;itors; I keeping equally clo&s;e to the Letter of the Sacred Hi&s;tory. (2.) This <HI>Hypo|the&s;is</HI> gives a rational Account of the Scripture Stile, wherein a <HI>Day</HI>, even in after-Ages, very frequently denotes a <HI>Year</HI>; as is commonly taken notice of by Expo&s;itors. Thus by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf, the word <HI>Day</HI> is not only, in the very Recapitu|lation of the Creation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. ii.4, 5.</NOTE> us'd for the entire <HI>Six: (The&s;e are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the Day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, and eve|ry plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew.)</HI> But, in other Places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap. iv.3.</NOTE> as it &s;eems, for the Space of a <HI>Year. And at the end of Days</HI>, or after &s;ome <HI>Years, it came to pa&s;s that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">C. v.4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>The Days of A|dam, after he had begotten Seth, were eight hun|dred Years. And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.</HI> And &s;o of the re&s;t of the Genealogies in that Chapter. Thus in others of the holy Writers:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jud. xvii.10.</NOTE> <HI>I will give thee ten &s;hekels of &s;ilver by the days</HI>, i. e. <HI>per annos</HI>, by the <HI>years</HI>, or every <HI>year</HI>. The like Phra&s;es we have of <HI>David:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Sam. ii.11.</NOTE> <HI>The number of days that David was king in Hebron, over the hou&s;e of Judah, was &s;even years and &s;ix months.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Kings ii.11.

in the Prophet, <HI>Bring your Tythes after three days</HI>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amos iv.4.</NOTE> Thus, 'tis not a little remarkable, that what in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is, <HI>It came to pa&s;s in proce&s;s of time,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. xxi.19.</NOTE> <HI>at the end of two days, Jehoram's bowels fell out, by rea&s;on of his &s;ickne&s;s</HI>; appear'd to be &s;o plain|ly meant of &s;o many Years, that our Tran&s;lators not only render it &s;o, but do not &s;o much as put the original Reading into the Margin, as in &s;uch Ca&s;es they u&s;ually do. Which ways of &s;peak|ing, with others that follow, may &s;eem alluded to, and explain'd by the&s;e two, tho' them&s;elves &s;omewhat of a different Nature. <HI>Your Children</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Num. xiv.33, 34.</NOTE> &s;ays God to the <HI>I&s;raelites, &s;hall wander in the wil|derne&s;s forty years; after the number of the days in which ye &s;earched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, &s;hall you bear your iniquities, even forty years. Lye thou</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. iv.4, 5, 6.</NOTE> &s;ays God to the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel, on thy left &s;ide, and lay the iniquity of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael upon it; according to the num|ber of the Days that thou &s;halt lye upon it, thou &s;halt bear their iniquity: For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety Days; &s;o &s;halt thou bear the iniquity of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael.

But what I mainly and prin|cipally intend here, is, that known, frequent, and &s;olemn way in the Prophetick Writings of deter|mining <HI>Years</HI> by <HI>Days</HI>; being indeed the con&s;tant Method in all the Prophecies belonging to the Chri&s;tian Church; the In&s;tances of which are very obvious; &s;ome whereof I &s;hall here barely quote for the Reader's Satisfaction; (and more in a Ca&s;e &s;o notorious and remarkable, need not here be done.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dan. viii.13, 14.</NOTE>) <HI>How long &s;hall be the vi&s;ion concerning the

All which Expre&s;&s;ions, with others of the &s;ame Na|ture, are not accountable; I mean, there is no &s;atisfactory Rea&s;on can be given, why a <HI>Day</HI> &s;hould &s;o frequently denote a <HI>Year</HI> in the Sacred Wri|tings, on any other <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>. We u&s;ually, in|deed, content our &s;elves in the&s;e Ca&s;es with the bare knowing the Meaning of Scripture Expre&s;|&s;ions, as if they were cho&s;en at a Venture: And &s;o, for in&s;tance, finding a <HI>Day</HI> to repre&s;ent a <HI>Year</HI> in the &s;ame Books, we re&s;t &s;atisfied, without enquiring why a <HI>Day</HI>, rather than an <HI>Hour</HI>, a <HI>Week</HI>, or <HI>Month</HI>, (the two latter of which Terms are yet us'd by the&s;e Authors) were pitch'd up|on to &s;ignify the before-mention'd Space to us; or why, if the word <HI>Day</HI> mu&s;t be made u&s;e of, it mu&s;t mean a determinate ju&s;t <HI>Year</HI>, rather than a <HI>Week</HI>, or a <HI>Month</HI>, &s;o frequently in the Sacred, e&s;pecially in the Prophetick Writings. But 'tis very &s;uppo&s;able, that 'tis our Ignorance or Unskilfulne&s;s in the Stile of Scripture, and tho&s;e Things therein delivered, (not the Inac|curacy of the Writers them&s;elves) which occa|&s;ions our lax and general Interpretations. It will &s;ure at lea&s;t be allow'd me, that where|ever not only the Meaning of Phra&s;es, but the Original and Foundation of &s;uch their Mean|ing, is naturally and ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ignable, an Account thereof is readily to be embrac'd. And certain|ly the primitive <HI>Years</HI> of the World being once &s;uppos'd to have been <HI>Days</HI> al&s;o; and call'd by that Name in the Hi&s;tory of the Creation, this Matter will be very ea&s;y; the &s;ucceeding Stile of Scripture will appear only a Continuation of the primitive; and fitted to hint to us a Time where|in a <HI>Day</HI> and a <HI>Year</HI> were really the &s;ame: And
<PB N="92" REF="198">
this without any Diminution of the true De&s;igns of the Prophetick Numbers; I mean the invol|ving their Predictions in &s;o much, and no more Ob|&s;curity, as might conceal their Meaning till their Completion, or till &s;uch Time at lea&s;t as the Di|vine Wi&s;dom thought mo&s;t proper for their Mani|fe&s;tation in &s;ucceeding Ages. So that this Argument demon&s;trates the pre&s;ent Expo&s;ition to afford a natural Foundation of accounting for &s;uch ways of &s;peaking in the Holy Scriptures, which other|wi&s;e are, as to their Occa&s;ion and Original, unaccountable; and con&s;equently, proves it to be as truly agreeable to the <HI>Stile</HI>, as the former did to the <HI>Letter</HI> of the Sacred Writings. (3.) The &s;ix <HI>Days</HI> of Creation, and the &s;eventh of Re&s;t, were, by Divine Command, to be in after-Ages commemorated by <HI>Years</HI>, as well as by <HI>Days</HI>; and &s;o in Rea&s;on an&s;wer'd alike to both tho&s;e Deno|minations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. ii.1, 2, 3.</NOTE> 'Tis evident, that the Works of the Creation were compleated in &s;ix <HI>Evenings</HI> and <HI>Mornings</HI>, or &s;ix Revolutions of the Sun, call'd <HI>Days</HI>; and that the &s;eventh was immediately &s;et apart and &s;anctified as a <HI>Day</HI> of Re&s;t, and Memo|rial of the Creation ju&s;t before compleated: And 'tis evident that this Sanctification of the &s;e|venth, as well as the Operations of the &s;ix forego|ing, belong'd to the primitive State of the World before the Fall. Now that we may know what Sort of <HI>Days</HI> the&s;e were, 'twill be proper to en|quire into the en&s;uing Times; and ob&s;erve, after the Di&s;tinction of <HI>Days</HI> and <HI>Years</HI> undoubtedly obtain'd, what con&s;tant Revolutions of &s;ix for Work, and a &s;eventh for Re&s;t there appear; or in what Manner, and by what Spaces, the&s;e Origi|nal ones were commemorated; which will go a great way to clear the Point we are upon. And here, 'tis evident, that when God gave Laws to
<PB N="93" REF="199">
the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI>, he allow'd them &s;ix ordinary <HI>Days</HI> of Work, and ordain'd the &s;eventh for a <HI>Day</HI> of Re&s;t or Sabbath; in Imitation and Memory of his Working the fir&s;t &s;ix, and Re&s;ting or keeping a Sabbath on the &s;eventh <HI>Day</HI>, at the Creation of the World.

Creation, by the Sacred Hi&s;tory, concurring with Ancient Tradition, appear to have been lei&s;urely, regular, and gradual, without any Precipitancy or Acceleration, by a miraculous Hand on every Occa&s;ion: Which is impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;uppos'd in tho&s;e <HI>Days</HI> of twenty four &s;hort Hours only; but if they were as long as the pre&s;ent <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, they were truly agreeable and propor|tionable to the &s;ame Productions. Which Con&s;e|quence will be &s;o ea&s;ily allow'd me, that I may venture to &s;ay, That as certain as is the regular and gentle, the natural and lei&s;urely Procedure of the Works of the Creation, (of which I know no good Rea&s;on, from any Warrant &s;acred or prophane, to make any que&s;tion;) &s;o certain is the Propo&s;ition we are now upon, or &s;o certainly the primitive <HI>Days</HI> and <HI>Years</HI> were all one. (5.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.9,&mdash;13.</NOTE>) Two &s;uch Works are by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> a&s;cribed to the third <HI>Day</HI>, which (if that were not longer than one of ours now,) are inconceivable and incom|patible. On the former Part of this <HI>Day</HI>, the Waters of the Globe were to be drain'd off all the dry Lands into the Seas; and on the &s;ame <HI>Day</HI> afterward, all the Plants and Vegetables were to &s;pring out of the Earth. Now the Ve|locity of running Waters is not &s;o great, as in a Part of one of our &s;hort <HI>Days</HI>, to de&s;cend from the middle Regions of the dry Land into the Seas adjoining to them; nor if it were, could the Land be dry enough in an In&s;tant for the Producti|on of all tho&s;e Plants and Vegetables, which yet we are a&s;&s;ur'd appear'd the &s;ame <HI>Day</HI> upon the Face of it; which Difficulties vani&s;h, if we allow the primi|tive <HI>Days</HI> to have been <HI>Years</HI> al&s;o; as will more fully be made appear in due Place.

it &s;elf) put together, is va&s;tly more than is conceivable in the &s;hort Space of one &s;ingle Day, in the vulgar Sen&s;e of it.

He mu&s;t have Time allotted him, in Proportion to the Bu&s;ine&s;s to be done, or el&s;e 'tis not to be expected of him. And 'tis plain, That <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were mainly concern'd in the latter Actions of this <HI>Day:</HI> So that by a ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence, That <HI>Day</HI> in which <HI>they</HI> went through &s;o many and different Scenes, and perform'd &s;o many Acti|ons, requiring at lea&s;t no &s;mall Part of a <HI>Year</HI>; and that after them&s;elves and all the dry-land A|nimals had been on the &s;ame <HI>Day</HI> produc'd, was certainly &s;uch a <HI>Day</HI> as might be proportionate to &s;uch Operations, and not &s;horter than a <HI>Year</HI>, which the pre&s;ent <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> allows in the Ca&s;e. (7.) If the Hi&s;tory of the Fall of Man be ei|ther included in the &s;ixth <HI>Day</HI>, according to the Ancient Tradition of the <HI>Jews</HI>, which I confe&s;s to be very improbable; or belong to the &s;eventh, as might, by coming as near as po&s;&s;ible to &s;uch old Tradition, more probably be allow'd: On ei|ther of the&s;e Suppo&s;itions, there is the greate&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity imaginable of &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a <HI>Day</HI> much longer than is commonly done. Which, I think, is of it &s;elf &s;o plain, that I need not ag|gravate the Matter, but leave it to the free Con|&s;ideration of the Reader. (8.) A Day is, I think, no where in the whole Bible expre&s;s'd by Evening-Mornings [<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">] but in this Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation, and in one of the Predictions of <HI>Daniel</HI>; where a famous Vi|&s;ion is &s;til'd the <HI>Evening-Morning Vi&s;ion</HI>.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E&s;&s;ay on the</HI> Reve|lation.

To all the&s;e Arguments from Scripture and the Na|ture of Things, let me add one very &s;urprizing Te|&s;timony of Antiquity to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, which a Friend of mine &s;ince the fir&s;t Edition &s;ugge&s;ted to me; namely, that of <HI>Empedocles</HI> in <HI>Plutarch</HI>; which coming unexpectedly &s;o entirely home to our Point, and &s;o exactly determining the Time when the Day was of this extraordinary Length, name|ly, at the fir&s;t Origination of Mankind; may be look'd upon as decretory in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; and 'tis this:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plut. de Placit. Philo&s;.</HI> l. 5. c. 18.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. <HI>'Twas the Doctrine of</HI> Empedocles, <HI>that when Mankind &s;prang originally from the Earth, the Length of the Day, by rea&s;on of the Slowne&s;s of the Sun's Motion, was equal to ten of our pre&s;ent Months</HI>. Which if we allow to refer to the <HI>Day-time</HI> alone, I mean the Space of the Sun's being above the <HI>Horizon</HI>, which is a common Acceptation of the word <HI>Day</HI>; accords &s;o exactly with my <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, as will hereafter appear, that nothing can do more &s;o; and renders all other additional Rea&s;onings le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. In fine, All the&s;e Arguments to me appear very &s;atisfactory, and evince, that the fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing and peculiar Character of &s;uch a primitive State of Nature as was before menti|on'd, did really belong to our Earth before the Fall, and that then a <HI>Day</HI> and a <HI>Year</HI> were exact|ly one and the &s;ame Space of Time.</P>

<P N="1"><PB N="105" REF="211">(1.) The Paralleli&s;m of the <HI>Axis</HI> of a Diur|nal, to that of an Annual Revolution, is, &s;o far as I find, a perfect Stranger to the Sy&s;tem of the World; there being, I think, not one of the hea|venly Bodies, <HI>Sun</HI> or <HI>Planet</HI>, but has its own <HI>Axis</HI> oblique to the Orbit in which it moves. (2.) It will be farther evinc'd hereafter, That,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phaenom. <HI>32.</HI> infra.</NOTE> <HI>de facto</HI>, before the Flood, the <HI>Axis</HI> of the Earth was oblique to its Annual Orbit, the Plane of the Ecliptick; and the Year di&s;tingui&s;h'd into the pre|&s;ent Sea&s;ons, <HI>Spring, Summer, Autumn</HI>, and <HI>Win|ter</HI>. (3.) That equable and healthful Temper of the Air, which the <HI>Theori&s;t</HI> chiefly relied upon, as nece&s;&s;ary to the Longevity of the Antedeluvians, and fully prov'd by Authority, &s;hall be accounted for without &s;uch an <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>. (4.) The Te&s;timo|nies before alledg'd do not, if rightly con&s;ider'd, &s;uit this <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>; nay, in truth, they fully con|fute it. Of the five Characters before-mention'd, under which we have reduc'd the main Te&s;timo|nies, there are two which are common to this, and to the <HI>Theori&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>. (1.) The perpetual and univer&s;al Equinox. (2.) The Coincidence of the Equator and Ecliptick, (tho' in &s;omewhat a different manner.) So that the Te&s;timonies for the&s;e two can neither e&s;tabli&s;h the one, nor the other, as equally &s;uiting them both. The other three are peculiar to that <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> we have been proving, and by con&s;equence at the &s;ame Time e&s;tabli&s;h that, and confute the <HI>Theori&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>. And the&s;e three are, (1.) The Equality of a <HI>Day</HI> and a <HI>Year</HI>. (2.) The <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Planets</HI> Ri&s;ing in the <HI>We&s;t</HI>, and Setting in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>. (3.) The Po&s;i|tion of the Poles near the Horizon, with the after Elevation of the <HI>Northern</HI>, the Depre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Southern</HI> Pole, and the Inclination or Bending of the Heavenly Bodies Cour&s;es towards the <HI>South</HI>.
<PB N="106" REF="212">
'Tis evident at fir&s;t View, that the two former of the&s;e three la&s;t mention'd <HI>Phoenomena</HI>, are incon|&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Theori&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, and on a little Con&s;ideration 'twill be &s;o of the la&s;t al&s;o. For while the Poles of the Earth or World remain the &s;ame, as depending on the &s;ame proper <HI>Axis</HI> of the Earth's own Diurnal Revolution; 'tis plain, the Latitude of Places on the Earth, or the Eleva|tion of the Pole equal thereto, remains invaria|ble; and &s;o the Pole which to the Inhabitants of Paradi&s;e was elevated at the lea&s;t 30 Degrees, could not be at the Horizon, whatever right Po|&s;ition the <HI>Axis</HI> of the Earth might have with re|&s;pect to the Ecliptick. On the &s;ame Account there could, even in the <HI>Theori&s;t</HI>'s own <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, be no new Elevation of the one, or Depre&s;&s;ion of the other Pole at the Deluge, nor Inclination of the Cour&s;es of the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Planets</HI> towards the <HI>South</HI>. All that could on the <HI>Theori&s;t</HI>'s Principles be ef|fected, (be&s;ides the Earth's Equator, and Poles pointing to different fix'd Stars, and its Con&s;equen|ces) was only this; That whereas before, the <HI>Sun</HI> was always in the Equator, or middle Di&s;tance from any Climate, it afterwards by turns came nearer to them, (as we commonly, tho' carele&s;ly expre&s;s it) in <HI>Summer</HI>, and went farther from them in <HI>Winter</HI>, than before; which, upon the whole, was no more a Bent or Inclination to one Part of the Heavens than to the other; and &s;o of Planets al&s;o. And the Ca&s;e is the &s;ame as to the Poles of the Eclip|tick; the <HI>Northern</HI> one being &s;till as much elevated above that of the World at one Hour of the Day, as depre&s;s'd beneath it at another. All which is, I think, &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that the Te&s;timonies of Antiquity, alledg'd by the <HI>Theori&s;t</HI> for the per|petual <HI>Equinox</HI>, or the right Po&s;ition of the Earth's <HI>Axis</HI> till the Deluge, and the oblique Po&s;ition,

of the Earth's Axis</HI>; do &s;till more compleatly, and even unan&s;werably prove, that the Time of the&s;e great Mutations is rightly a&s;&s;igned in the pre&s;ent <HI>Theory</HI>.</P>
<P N="2">II. I come now, in the &s;econd Place, to &s;hew, That the pre&s;ent <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI> do prove, that its Diurnal Motion did not com|mence till &s;ome Time after its Annual, and by con&s;equence, in all Probability, not till after the Fall of Man. And an egregious Confirmation of this A&s;&s;ertion we meet with in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions</HI>, Numb. 195. and it is the celebrated Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>'s <HI>Theory of the Variation of the Magnetick Needle</HI>; as corrected by my own Ob&s;ervations and Di&s;coveries &s;ince, to be found in my <HI>Di&s;covery of the Longitude and Latitude by the Dipping-Needle</HI>. Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>, therefore, from very many Ob&s;erva|tions, taken by &s;everal Per&s;ons, in di&s;tant Places, and at various Times, has di&s;cover'd at lea&s;t two Magnetical Poles, the one <HI>Northern</HI>, and the other <HI>Southern</HI>; from which ari&s;es all the Declination of the Horizontal and Inclination of the <HI>Dipping-Needle</HI>, according to the Difference of Place. Which Poles being moveable, thence ari&s;e the&s;e Variations of Magnetick Needles, according to the Difference of Time. Now to account for the&s;e moveable Magnetick Poles, there mu&s;t be a very great moving &s;pherical Body within the Earth, and extending its Effects from Pole to Pole: The Center of this great moving Body, the Doctor right|ly proves to be the &s;ame with the Center of the Earth; becau&s;e otherwi&s;e its Motion would change the Center of Gravity in the Earth, the Equilibra|tion of its Parts, and the <HI>Axis</HI> of the Diurnal Rotation; and would withal alter the Surface of the Sea. This moving internal Sub&s;tance mu&s;t al&s;o be loo&s;e from the external Parts of the Earth;
<PB N="110" REF="216">
&s;o that the external Parts may be reckon'd as a Shell, and the internal as a <HI>Nucleus</HI>, with a fluid Medium between. The internal <HI>Nucleus</HI> mu&s;t be a Magnet, having its Poles in two Places di&s;tant from the Earth's <HI>Axis</HI>; which latter Poles do &s;lowly change their Place in re&s;pect of the exter|nal Earth: This Motion is <HI>We&s;tward</HI>, and by con|&s;equence, the <HI>Nucleus</HI> has not attain'd the &s;ame Degree of Velocity with the exterior Parts in their diurnal Revolution; but &s;o very nearly equals it, that in 365 Revolves, the Difference is &s;carce &s;en|&s;ible. So that this <HI>Nucleus</HI> is many Hundreds of Years in revolving round the Earth <HI>We&s;twards</HI>, to the &s;ame Point it had &s;et out before: The Rea&s;on why the internal <HI>Nucleus</HI> has not that Degree of Velocity which the exterior Shell has, Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> agrees mu&s;t ari&s;e from the Impul&s;e whereby the diurnal Motion was impre&s;s'd upon the Earth; which being given to the external Parts, is thence communicated to the internal, but not &s;o perfectly as to equal the fir&s;t Motion impre&s;s'd on, and &s;till con&s;erv'd by the &s;uperficial Parts of the Globe. Thus far Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> agrees with me. So that here we &s;ee, That when one of the mo&s;t &s;agacious Na|turali&s;ts that ever was, rea&s;ons from plain Matter of Fact, or the known Ob&s;ervations of the Varia|tion of the Declination of the Magnetick Needle, he is oblig'd to make exactly &s;uch Deductions as from quite other Principles and Rea&s;onings I &s;aw Ground to &s;uppo&s;e; and at once confirms many of the principal and mo&s;t paradoxical Parts of this Theory; and e&s;pecially that Propo&s;ition I am now upon, namely, That the Earth's diurnal Mo|tion did not commence till &s;ome Time after its annual, <HI>i. e.</HI> till after it was entirely form'd and con&s;olidated together; and by con&s;equence, in all
<PB N="111" REF="217">
Probability, not till after the Fall of Man. In the next Place, therefore,</P>
<P N="3">III. I &s;hall a&s;&s;ign the probable Mechanical Cau&s;e of this Commencement of the Earth's Di|urnal Motion, after its Annual had continued &s;ome Time, and &s;hew that that Cau&s;e is agree|able to the pre&s;ent <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature and of the Earth. Now the only a&s;&s;ignable Cau&s;e, is that of the Impul&s;e of a Comet with little or no Atmo&s;phere, or of a central Solid hitting ob|liquely upon the Earth along &s;ome Parts of its pre&s;ent Equator. From which Impul&s;e, both the Annual Orbit of the Earth, as we &s;hall ob&s;erve pre&s;ently, would be alter'd; and a Vertiginous Motion about a new and real <HI>Axis</HI>, would cer|tainly commence. And this I &s;uppo&s;e was the true Mechanical Original of the Earth's Diurnal Motion, and no other. And that this Cau&s;e is agreeable to the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature, is plain; becau&s;e &s;uch a Motion and Impul&s;e of a Comet is as po&s;&s;ible as any other what&s;oever, from the now known <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of their Motions; and be|cau&s;e the exceeding Brightne&s;s of many Comets Heads, in <HI>Hevelius</HI> and others, makes it very pro|bable, that &s;ome Comets have very little Atmo|&s;phere, and others perhaps none at all. And then this Cau&s;e is not only agreeable to, but almo&s;t de|mon&s;trated by the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of our pre&s;ent Earth: For, as we have ju&s;t now &s;een, Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> and my &s;elf do find, from the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Variation and Inclination of Needles, that the external Parts of the Earth receiv'd the original Impul&s;e which caus'd the Diurnal Motion; that it was from them convey'd to the internal Parts, and this &s;o plainly, that tho&s;e internal Parts have not yet in 6200 Years Time receiv'd the entire Impre&s;&s;ion, but move round &s;omewhat
<PB N="112" REF="218">
more &s;lowly to this very Day. Which is not only a &s;ufficient, but a very &s;urprizing Account of this Matter; only it mu&s;t here be ob&s;erv'd, that in Probability, the Comet which cau&s;ed the Diurnal Revolution, was of the Bigne&s;s rather of one of the &s;mall Secondary, than of the large Primary Planets; for otherwi&s;e, by its cau&s;ing va&s;t Tides in the Aby&s;s, after it was pa&s;s'd by, it would have occa&s;ion'd many more Alterations in the Earth, than we have any Rea&s;on to believe happen'd at that Time.</P>
<P>To the&s;e three grand Arguments for the Proof of my main Conclu&s;ion, I &s;hall, by way of &s;uper|numerary ones, or Appendages, add one or two more, and &s;o leave the whole to the Con&s;idera|tion of the impartial Reader.</P>
<P N="4">(4) The State of Mankind, without que&s;tion, and perhaps that of other Animals, was before the Fall va&s;tly different from the pre&s;ent; and con&s;equently requir'd a proportionably different State of external Nature; of which, without the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> before us, no Account can be gi|ven, or at lea&s;t has not yet by any been attempt|ed. The World, as to other Things, &s;eems to have been at fir&s;t, in great mea&s;ure, put into the &s;ame Condition which we &s;till enjoy; and yet Rea&s;on, as well as Scripture, a&s;&s;ures us, that &s;o different a Condition of Things in the Ani|mal, Rational and Moral, mu&s;t have been &s;uited with an agreeably different one in the Natural and Corporeal World. Which being con&s;ider'd, and that at the &s;ame Time no remarkable Dif|ference has been, or perhaps can be a&s;&s;ign'd, but what the Hypothe&s;is before us, and its Con&s;e|quences afford us; and that withal a &s;atisfactory Account of the &s;everal Particulars is deducible from the &s;ame, as I hope to make appear here|after; upon the whole, I think this a very con&s;i|derable
<PB N="113" REF="219">
Atte&s;tation to what has been before in&s;i&s;t|ed on.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) La&s;tly, The pre&s;ent <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> gives an ea&s;y Account of the Change in the Natural, on the Change in the Moral World; and of the &s;ad Ef|fects of the Divine Malediction upon the Earth after the Fall of Man; which till now has not, that I know of, been &s;o much as attempted by any. Several have been endeavouring to account for that Change which the Deluge made in the World: But they are &s;ilent as to the natural Cau&s;es or Occa&s;ions of a Change, which (Antiquity, &s;a|cred or prophane, being judge) was in all re|&s;pects &s;till more remarkable: The State of In|nocency, and that of Sin, being &s;ure on all Ac|counts more different from, and contradictory to each other, than the Antediluvian and Po&s;tdilu|vian, either in Rea&s;on can be &s;uppos'd, or in Fact be prov'd to be. Now as to the Particulars of this Change, and the Cau&s;es of them; and how well, on the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> we are upon, they corre&s;pond to one another, I mu&s;t leave that to the Judgment of the Reader, when I come to treat of 'em in their own Place hereafter. In the mean time, this may fairly be &s;aid, That <HI>This</HI> being the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Attempt at an <HI>Entire Theory</HI>, or &s;uch an one as takes in <HI>All</HI> the great Mutations of the Earth; as it will on that Account claim the Candor of the Reader, and his unbia&s;s'd Re&s;olution of embracing the Truth (how|ever new or unu&s;ual the A&s;&s;ertions may &s;eem) when &s;ufficiently evidenc'd to him; &s;o the Coin|cidence of Things from fir&s;t to la&s;t, thro' &s;o many Stages and Periods of Nature, and the Solution of all the main <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of every &s;uch different Stage and Period, from the Creation to the Con|&s;ummation of all Things; if they be found ju&s;t,

In all which, may the&s;e my poor Endeavours prove as &s;atisfa|ctory to the Minds of others, as they have been to my own, and give them the &s;ame A&s;&s;urance of the Verity and Divine Authority of tho&s;e Holy Books, where the &s;everal Periods are re|corded, and the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> chiefly pre&s;erv'd, which the Di&s;covery of the&s;e Things has afford|ed my &s;elf, and I am &s;ure that my Labours will not be in vain.</P>
<P><HI>Scholium.</HI> It will be fit here to &s;tate my <HI>Hypo|the&s;is</HI>, or Opinion about the Circum&s;tances of the Earth's Annual Motion before the Commence|ment of its Diurnal, more particularly; that &s;o the Reader may not only ob&s;erve, that the one was <HI>prior</HI> to the other in general, but how and in what manner that Motion was perform'd in the Primi|tive or Paridi&s;iacal State of Mankind. Notwith|&s;tanding therefore, I &s;hall hereafter a&s;&s;ert, and at|tempt to prove, that the <HI>Original Orbits</HI> of the Planets, and particularly the Earth, were <HI>perfect Circles</HI>; meaning by the <HI>Original Orbits</HI>, tho&s;e in which they were to revolve immediately after they were not only entirely form'd, but were al&s;o to be univer&s;ally inhabited; yet I mu&s;t here add, that I &s;uppo&s;e that this Reduction of the very oblong eccentrical Orbit of our Earth at lea&s;t, if not of the other Planets, whil&s;t it was a Comet, into an uniform concentrical and circular one,
<PB N="115" REF="221">
which I &s;uppo&s;e it had before the Deluge, was gradual, and not done all at once; the greate&s;t Part at the commencing of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation; and the re&s;t at the commencing of the Diurnal Rotation afterwards. Nay, indeed, this is almo&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity to be &s;uppos'd; becau&s;e the Diurnal Rotation could not mechanically, or without a Miracle, begin, but by the oblique Colli&s;ion of a Comet, which we have already &s;uppos'd the Cau&s;e of it; and this Colli&s;ion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily affect the Annual Motion, and alter the <HI>Species</HI> of its <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> al&s;o: Which being &s;uppos'd, and that withal, Providence adju&s;ted all Circum&s;tances, &s;o as &s;hould be mo&s;t for the Advantage of the Re|gions adjoining to <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI>, where alone <HI>Adam</HI> and the other Creatures dwelt in this State, as is mo&s;t rea&s;onable to do; we &s;hall then have our Earth revolving in a moderately Eccentrical <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI>, without any Diurnal Rotation, about the Sun in the Space of a Year; the exact Length whereof will not now be determinable; a Day and a Year will be all one: We &s;hall have &s;ome Diameter of the Earth, which pa&s;s'd near Pa|radi&s;e parallel to the longer <HI>Axis</HI> of that <HI>Ellip|&s;is</HI> it revolv'd in: And withal we &s;hall have the Place of Paradi&s;e, re&s;pecting nearly the &s;ame fix'd Stars with the <HI>Perihelion</HI> of the <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI>. Which being &s;uppos'd, we may ob&s;erve, that as a Circular Orbit is much the be&s;t for a Globe inhabited <HI>all round, That</HI> providing equally for the Conveni|ence of both Hemi&s;pheres; &s;o is this Elliptick Orbit the be&s;t for a Globe inhabited but in <HI>one Place</HI>, as the Earth was in its primitive State; <HI>This</HI> providing peculiarly for the Happine&s;s of that particular Spot, where alone the living Part of the Creation was to re&s;ide; as on a little Con&s;i|deration will ea&s;ily appear.

the Heat of the Day-time would gradually increa&s;e <HI>before</HI>, and decrea&s;e <HI>after</HI> Noon; but yet would ne|ver be violent; becau&s;e a great Part of the Increa&s;e of the Heat by the Sun's ri&s;ing above the Horizon, &s;till higher and higher in the Forenoon or Spring, would be prevented by the Earth's real receding from him, and approaching nearer his <HI>Aphelion</HI> during the &s;ame Time: And <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;</HI> in the Afternoon, or Summer; which would render the State of the Air more equal and uniform, and le&s;s unea&s;y or inconvenient than any other Method what&s;oever. Thus al&s;o not only the Cold of the Night, (which by our Nearne&s;s to the Sun, would be incon&s;iderable) but the too long Duration and Darkne&s;s thereof would be entirely avoided. For the whole Night would then bear no more Pro|portion to the entire <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, than in the <HI>Ellip|&s;is</HI> the <HI>Area p</HI>B<HI>q</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 3.</NOTE> below the <HI>Latus Rectum</HI>, bears to the whole <HI>Area</HI> HBGF; &s;uppo&s;e the Proportion of 1 to 6, which will amount to no more than two Months: Out of which Night|time we mu&s;t deduct the two <HI>Crepu&s;cula</HI>, each of near a Fortnight, which now reduces the Du|ration and Darkne&s;s of the Night it &s;elf, to about a &s;ingle Month; out of which al&s;o another Fort|night is to be &s;till deducted for the Time of the Moon's being above the Horizon, and enlighten|ing the Earth: So that at la&s;t if the Moon's <HI>Cre|pu&s;cula</HI> be at all allow'd for, as they ought to be, we &s;hall &s;carce have a &s;ingle Week of pure Darkne&s;s in the whole Year; to the great Com|fort, Advantage, and Benefit of this truly Para|di&s;iacal State. But if it be objected, that this implies, that only &s;ome Parts of the Earth were habitable with any Convenience before the Fall, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e about Paradi&s;e; or, however, not more than that Hemi&s;phere: I reply, That this Objection
<PB N="117" REF="223">
&s;eems to me hardly enough con&s;iderable to de&s;erve an An&s;wer. I &s;hould think it no great Matter, if all the Earth, excepting the Regions about Paradi&s;e, were <HI>uninhabitable</HI> at a Time when they were <HI>not to be inhabited</HI>. For to what Purpo&s;e is it, that all proper Provi&s;ion be made for the Entertainment of a Company of Gue&s;ts at a Table, when 'tis certainly known that <HI>not one of tho&s;e</HI> Gue&s;ts will be there. Providence does ever wonderfully pro|vide for the Accommodation of his Creatures, where-ever it places them: But that a &s;uitable Pro|vi&s;ion is made for them where they will <HI>never</HI> be plac'd, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to imagine. But if it be &s;till farther objected, that in this <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, the Heat of the Sun before the Fall would at la&s;t be intolerable, nay &s;everal hundred times as great as with us at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e of the Continuance of his Stay above the Horizon for &s;o many Months together. I an&s;wer, that this is all plainly a Mi|&s;take: The Heat produc'd by the Fire, or the Sun, for &s;ome Time con&s;iderably increa&s;es; but this only for a while, till a &s;uitable or competent De|gree of Heat, corre&s;pondent to the Sun or the Fire's Power at that Di&s;tance be produc'd, but no longer. Let us try this a little by Calculation in Dr. <HI>Keill</HI>'s way, who made the Objection. A Piece of Wax will melt in a Second of Time, &s;uppo&s;e, at the Di&s;tance of an Inch from a very hot Fire; becau&s;e the Degree of Heat there is &s;uf|ficient to di&s;&s;olve its Texture immediately. Let us then remove it to the Di&s;tance of 100 Inches, where the Heat is 10,000 times weaker, for the Space of 10,000 Seconds, or near 3 Hours Space. The Quantity of Heat therefore in Dr. <HI>Keill</HI>'s way mu&s;t be equal to the Rectangle contain'd, be|twixt the Sine of the Angle of Incidence (which we &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame in both Ca&s;es) and the Time
<PB N="118" REF="224">
of Continuance; or exactly equal to the former Heat; and mu&s;t therefore have the &s;ame Effect in 3 Hours Time that the other Heat had in one Second, and melt the Wax as the other did. Which yet I pre&s;ume Dr. <HI>Keill</HI> did not believe it would. Thus let us compare the Inten&s;ene&s;s of the Heat of the Sun at the Equator and near the Poles, where the Sines of the Sun's Angle of Inci|dence [for the Day-time or 12 Hours at the Equa|tor, and for the 12 Hours at the Conclu&s;ion of the Half-year's Day near the Poles] are as 10 to 1; which, according to Dr. <HI>Keill</HI>, will be as 10 x 12 to 1 x 4320, or as 1 to 36; And &s;o the Heat near the Pole be 36 times as inten&s;e as that at the Equator; which I pre&s;ume Experience does not atte&s;t. But after all, this Objection, if it were true, chiefly re|lates to a Circular Orbit of the Earth before the Fall; but in the pre&s;ent Elliptick <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> is very little to the Purpo&s;e.</P>

But to come to the Matter it &s;elf: The Rea&s;ons I would offer, are the&s;e following.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The De&s;igns and U&s;es of Planets &s;eem mo&s;t properly to require circular Orbits. Now in order to give a rational Gue&s;s at the &s;ame De|&s;igns and U&s;es of Planets, I know no other way than that from a Compari&s;on with the Earth. And here, &s;ince we find one of the Planets, and that plac'd in the Middle among the re&s;t, to agree with the others in every Thing of which we have any Means of Enquiry; 'tis but rea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e, that it does &s;o al&s;o in tho&s;e, which 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible for us, by any other certain way, to be a&s;&s;ured of. If we ob&s;erve a certain Engine in one Country, and &s;ee to what U&s;e 'tis put, and to what End it &s;erves; and if afterward we &s;ee ano|ther, tho' in a different Country, agreeing to the former in all Things, as far as we are able to di&s;co|ver: Tho' we are not informed of its De&s;ign and U&s;e, we yet very naturally, and very probably, believe that it &s;erves to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, and was intended for the &s;ame End with the former. Thus it ought &s;ure to be in the Ca&s;e before us; and by the &s;ame way of rea&s;oning, we may fairly conclude to what U&s;es all the Planets &s;erve, and on what general De&s;igns Providence makes u&s;e of them, <HI>viz.</HI> To be the Seats or Habitations of Ani|mals, and the Seminaries of &s;uch Plants and Vege|tables as are nece&s;&s;ary or convenient for their Sup|port and Su&s;tenance. Which being therefore pro|bably &s;uppos'd of the re&s;t, and certainly known of the Earth, I argue, That a circular Orbit, being the mo&s;t fit and proper for &s;uch Purpo&s;es,
<PB N="127" REF="233">

Such Creatures, Rati|onal, Sen&s;itive, or Vegetative, as are fit and di&s;|pos'd for a certain Degree of the Sun's Heat, are very much incommoded by one much greater, or much le&s;s; and by con&s;equence are peculiarly accommodate to a Circular, but by no means to an Eccentrical Orbit. And tho' the Inequality of the Earth's Di&s;tance from the Sun, in the dif|ferent Points of its Orbit, be &s;o incon&s;iderable, that we ob&s;erve little Effect of it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. <HI>Arg.</HI> 4. <HI>Con&s;eq.</HI> 2. <HI>Hypoth.</HI> xi. <HI>infra</HI>.</NOTE> yet in &s;ome of the other Orbits, which are much more Ec|centrical, it mu&s;t be very &s;en&s;ible, and have a mighty Influence on the Productions of Nature, and the Con&s;titution of Animals in Planets revol|ving therein. And what Rea&s;on can we imagine, why the <HI>Southern</HI> Hemi&s;phere, for in&s;tance, of a Planet, by the Situation of the <HI>Perihelion</HI> near its Summer Sol&s;tice, &s;hould be &s;o different from the <HI>Northern</HI>, in the primary Contrivance of the Divine Providence? This &s;eems not &s;o agreeable to the original Regularity and Uniformity of Na|ture; nor does it look like the immediate Effect of the Divine Power and Wi&s;dom in the fir&s;t Frame of the World, when all Things ju&s;t coming out of the Creator's Hands, mu&s;t be allow'd to have been perfect in their Kind, and exceeding good; when Creatures rational and irrational, of the &s;ame Species, Abilities, Faculties and Deme|rits, were in common to live upon the &s;everal Parts and Regions of it: And the natural State of Things was to be equally &s;uited to them all, and di&s;pos'd impartially among them.</P>

contending for. If indeed we had found a Mix|ture of Planets and Comets in the &s;ame Regions of the Solar Sy&s;tem, and a Confu&s;ion of the Orbits and Order of both: If we had di&s;cover'd all Spe|cies of <HI>Ellip&s;es</HI>, with all Degrees of Eccentricity from the Circle to the <HI>Parabola</HI>; the Propo&s;ition I am upon would be more than precarious, and but too di&s;agreeable to the Frame of Nature. But &s;ince we find no &s;uch Thing, but the clean con|trary; namely, That all the Comets revolve in Orbits &s;o extreamly eccentrical, that &s;uch Seg|ments of them as come within our Ob&s;ervation are almo&s;t <HI>parabolical</HI>, or of an infinite Degree of Eccentricity; 'tis not unrea&s;onable to conclude, That, likely enough, the contradi&s;tinct Species of Bodies, the Planets, originally revolv'd in Orbits of no degree of Eccentricity; that is, in perfect Circles: The Eccentrical or <HI>Elliptick</HI> Orbits of the one, among other things probably di&s;tin|gui&s;hing them from the other; which originally moved in Concentrical or Circular ones.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) This <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> is favour'd by the anci|ent A&s;tronomy; which &s;o pertinaciou&s;ly adher'd to the Circular <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, notwith&s;tanding all its Eccentricks, Epicyles, and &s;trange Wheel-work; that it may &s;eem the Effect of ancient Tradition, that once the Heavenly Motions were really Circular. And this is the more re|markable, becau&s;e, not only the true Sy&s;tem of the World, but the <HI>Conick Sections</HI>, and among them the <HI>Elliptick</HI> Figure was very anciently known and con&s;ider'd. By the Introduction of which, all the fanciful and uncouth Figments they were forc'd upon, might have been wholly &s;par'd, and an ea&s;y and natural <HI>Idea</HI> of the Planetary Motions obtain'd.

could &s;carce ever have been lo&s;t; and which yet, as far as I know, never came into the Minds of A&s;tronomers till the Great <HI>Kepler</HI>'s Time; who fir&s;t prov'd the Orbits to be <HI>Elliptick</HI>, too plainly to be denied, or almo&s;t doubted any longer.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The Quantity of the &s;everal Orbits <HI>Eccen|tricity</HI>, and the Po&s;ition of their <HI>Aphelia</HI>, are &s;o vari|ous, different, and without any vi&s;ible De&s;ign, Or|der or Method, &s;o far as is hitherto di&s;cover'd, that the whole looks more like the Re&s;ult of Second Cau&s;es, in &s;ucceeding Times, than the Primary Contrivance and Workman&s;hip of the Creator him&s;elf. 'Tis indeed po&s;&s;ible that there <HI>may</HI> be De&s;ign and Contrivance in the&s;e Things, tho' we cannot di&s;cern them; yet &s;eeing we have, on the common Grounds, no Rea&s;on to affirm &s;uch a Thing; &s;eeing the equidi&s;tant Situation from the Sun would more clearly &s;hew &s;uch De&s;ign and Contrivance, &s;eeing al&s;o, the original circular Motion of the Earth once granted, the Po&s;ition of the Earth's <HI>Aphelion</HI>, and the Quantity of its Or|bit's <HI>Eccentricity</HI>, do &s;o remarkably infer the Di|vine Wi&s;dom and Artifice therein, and are won|derfully &s;ub&s;ervient to the highe&s;t Purpo&s;es; (by the one, the Day of the Year when the Flood began; by the other, the Length of the Antedi|luvian Year, being nearly determinable; of which hereafter;) 'tis, I think, but fair Rea&s;oning to conclude, That that <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, which does &s;o certainly argue Art and Contrivance, Order and Providence, is to be preferr'd to another, which &s;eems to infer the clean contrary, or at be&s;t only leaves Room for a Po&s;&s;ibility thereof; as 'tis in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.

by a particular Providence, and were all (one way or other) fitted to the State of each Species of Creatures inhabiting the &s;everal Planets, accord|ing as their re&s;pective Behaviours or Circum|&s;tances, in their &s;everal Generations, requir'd; (of which the &s;ucceeding Theory will be a preg|nant In&s;tance:) But my Meaning is this; That when every Thing was ju&s;t as the Wi&s;dom of God was pleas'd to appoint; when each Crea|ture was compleat and perfect in its Kind, and &s;o &s;uited to the mo&s;t compleat and perfect State of external Nature; 'tis highly probable that the outward World, or every &s;uch State of external Nature, was even, uniform, and regular, and agreeable to the Nece&s;&s;ities of the whole Body of tho&s;e Creatures that were to be plac'd there|in; and as properly &s;uited to all their &s;everal Conveniencies, as was po&s;&s;ible, or rea&s;onable to be expected. Such a State, 'tis natural to believe, obtain'd through the Univer&s;e, till &s;ucceeding Changes in the Living and Rational, requir'd proportionable ones in the Inanimate and Corpo|real World. 'Tis mo&s;t philo&s;ophical, as well as mo&s;t pious, to a&s;cribe only what appears wi&s;e, regular, uniform, and harmonious, to the Fir&s;t Cau&s;e; (as the main <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Heaven|ly Bodies, their Places and Motions, do, to the greate&s;t degree of Wonder and Surprize;) but as to &s;uch Things as may &s;eem of another Nature, to attribute them entirely to &s;ub&s;equent Changes, which the mutual Actions of Bodies one upon another, fore-ordain'd and adju&s;ted by the Di|vine Providence, in various Periods, agreeably to the various Exigencies of Creatures, might bring to pa&s;s.</P>

that in &s;uch their Pa&s;&s;age they were &s;ometimes capable of cau&s;ing; nay, in very long Periods mu&s;t certainly, without a Miracle, have cau&s;ed great Alterations in the &s;ame; and that the Na|ture and Quantities of the pre&s;ent <HI>Eccentricities</HI> or Anomalies, are no other than what mu&s;t be ex|pected from &s;uch Cau&s;es; 'tis very rea&s;onable to allow the&s;e Effects to have really happen'd; and that con&s;equently all might be, as I here contend it was originally, orderly, and regular; and parti|cularly the Planetary Orbits uniform, concentri|cal and circular, as I am here concern'd to prove. If any one of us &s;hould ob&s;erve that a curious Clock, made and kept in Order by an excellent Arti&s;t, was very notably different from the true Time of the Day, and took notice withal of a certain Rub or Stoppage, which was very capable of cau&s;ing that Error in its Motion; he would ea&s;ily and undoubtedly conclude, that &s;uch an Error was truly occa&s;ion'd by that vi&s;ible Impe|diment; and never de&s;igned at fir&s;t, or procur'd by the Arti&s;t. The Application of which Re|&s;emblance is too obvious to need a Comment, and naturally enforces what I am now contending for.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) 'Tis evident, that all the little Planets about <HI>Jupiter</HI> move in Orbits truly circular, with|out any con&s;iderable Degree of Eccentricity: On which Account, the pre&s;ent <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> appears to be far from contrary to the Frame of Nature; nay, to be no other with regard to the <HI>Primary</HI>, than is, <HI>de facto</HI>, true in this <HI>Secondary</HI> Sy&s;tem; and from that &s;o remarkable a Parallel, may the more ea&s;ily be believ'd to have once been the Ca&s;e of this al&s;o.</P>

of the Planets, they would u&s;ually draw them al&s;o from the Plains of their former Orbits, and make them inclin'd or oblique to one another: So that where the Orbits are Eccentrical, 'tis probable, according to the pre&s;ent <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, the Plains mu&s;t be different, and oblique to each other; and where the Orbits are circular, the Plains of the &s;everal Orbits mu&s;t be as they were at fir&s;t, or, in Probability, coincident. Now this is really ob&s;ervable in the two Sy&s;tems la&s;t mention'd: The Plains of the circular Orbits about <HI>Jupiter</HI> being nearly, if not exactly coin|cident, and tho&s;e of the Eccentrical ones about the Sun being oblique to each other. Which Ob&s;ervation is no incon&s;iderable Argument, that originally the Planetary Orbits were exactly cir|cular; as well as that at the &s;ame time they were every one in the &s;ame common Plain, or in Plains coincident with one another. Which la&s;t men|tion'd <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, (to &s;peak a word or two of that by the way) tho' I look upon it as not unlikely, and &s;uch an one as &s;everal of the foregoing Ar|guments might be apply'd to, and do plead for; yet I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t farther upon it here; both becau&s;e the following Theory does not directly depend upon it in any Part; and becau&s;e the moving in different Plains does not cau&s;e any ill Effects, or notable Inconveniencies, in the Sy&s;tem of Nature, as we have &s;hewn the Eccentricity does; and &s;o cannot with the &s;ame Clearne&s;s and Force be urg'd again&s;t its being the original Workman&s;hip of God, as I have above di&s;cours'd in the other Ca&s;e. Only this I may &s;ay, That &s;eeing the Planetary Orbits are &s;till almo&s;t in the &s;ame Plain; &s;eeing the Comets Pa&s;&s;ages are capable of cau&s;ing &s;uch little Obliquity; nay, were they originally in the &s;ame Plain, in

more certainly &s;o at the Deluge, as will be here|after prov'd, whatever Pretence any other may at pre&s;ent make.

<P><HI>Scholium.</HI> In this Place, I cannot but propo&s;e a Conjecture I have for &s;ome Time had in my Mind about the Peopling of <HI>China</HI>; which I think may de&s;erve to be con&s;ider'd; and 'tis This; That the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> are the Offspring of <HI>Noah</HI> him&s;elf after the Flood, and not deriv'd from any of his other Po|&s;terity, <HI>Shem, Ham</HI>, or <HI>Japhet</HI>, as the Inhabitants of the re&s;t of the World are. This Conjecture depends on the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Account of the Po&s;terity of <HI>Shem, Ham</HI>, and <HI>Japhet</HI>, and of their Di&s;per&s;ion, gives no Hint of any that went &s;o far <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> as <HI>China</HI>, as I think is plain from the be&s;t Expo&s;itions of the 10th of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI>, where that Matter is chiefly treated of.</P>
<P N="2">II. Since the Di&s;per&s;ion of the Po&s;terity of <HI>Shem, Ham</HI>, and <HI>Japhet</HI>, appears to have begun about <HI>Ba|bylon</HI>; a Country &s;o remote as <HI>China</HI> could not be &s;o &s;oon reach'd and peopled, as the prodigious Num|bers of its Inhabitants at pre&s;ent &s;hew it to have been. The neare&s;t Regions mu&s;t have been fir&s;t and mo&s;t fully peopled; and the remoter not till Men were increas'd &s;ufficiently to require new Habitations; and accordingly, it has happen'd in the Countries of <HI>Europe, Africa</HI>, and the <HI>We|&s;tern</HI> Parts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI>; to which, I &s;uppo&s;e, the Di|&s;per&s;ion begun at <HI>Babel</HI> is confin'd. But this is a
<PB N="138" REF="244">
&s;ufficient Proof, that &s;o very large and prodigiou&s;ly populous a Country as <HI>China</HI>, could not be of &s;o late an Original, as it mu&s;t be in ca&s;e the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> are de|riv'd from this Di&s;per&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">III. The Sacred Hi&s;tory, &s;oon after the Flood, confines it &s;elf within the then known World: (Which, I think, did not include <HI>China</HI>, no more than <HI>America</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. ix.19.</NOTE> and which is &s;til'd the <HI>whole Earth</HI> very often in Scripture) and at the &s;ame Time &s;ays not a word of the great Father of the whole Race of Mankind, <HI>Noah</HI>, exeepting the Number of Years he liv'd.

<P N="9">(9.) The only Year among the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI>, and the Nations de&s;cended from them, that can come in Competition with this Year of 360 Days, is the Tropical Year, or a Year made ve|ry nearly equal to the Tropical by Cycles of Years, or proper Intercalations of Months or Days in certain revolving Periods. And that this Year was not originally in Civil U&s;e among&s;t 'em, appears very probable from the mo&s;t ancient Manner of determining the Sea&s;ons of the Year, which was not done by the Names of the Months and Days of the Civil Year, but by the Helia|cal Ri&s;ing and Setting of the fix'd Stars, as is well known to all that are conver&s;ant in the Old Poetry and A&s;tronomy. Now if the Tropical Year, or a Year made equivalent to it by pro|per Intercalations had been the Civil Year; it can hardly be imagin'd, that the ea&s;y and ob|vious Method of reckoning the Sea&s;ons by the Months and Days of the Civil Year &s;hould be entirely neglected; and &s;o odd and trouble&s;ome a Method as that of fixing 'em by the Heliacal Ri&s;ing and Setting of the fix'd Stars, &s;hould be entertain'd in its &s;tead.

Whereby 'tis plain, he took the Tropical Year to be 375 Days long, which is above 9 Days and 18 Hours more than the Truth.

And it cannot be ea&s;ily imagin'd, how &s;o great an Error &s;hould &s;o univer&s;ally obtain, unle&s;s the mo&s;t ancient Year and Month had been ju&s;t 360 and 30 Days in Length re&s;pe|ctively.</P>
<P>And thus, I think, I have clearly prov'd the fir&s;t Particular which I undertook, namely, That the anciente&s;t Year in U&s;e in mo&s;t Nations of the <HI>Po&s;tdiluvian</HI> World, was exactly 360 Days, and the Month exactly 30 Days. I come now to &s;how, That even in the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> World, not only the Year in civil U&s;e, but al&s;o the Solar Year, and the Lunar Year too, were each of them 360 Days in Length, and exactly commen&s;urate to one another. And here, if the Reader will make Allowances for the Di&s;tance and Ob&s;curity of the Times I am now about to treat of, and for the Scarcity of any Records belonging to them be&s;ides the Holy Scriptures; I believe he will find as much Evidenee, even for this <HI>&s;econd</HI> Particular, as can rea&s;onably be expected, and what is abundantly &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy him of the Truth and Reality of it.</P>
<P>And, (1.) &s;ince we have found, that the mo&s;t ancient <HI>Po&s;tdiluvian</HI> Year in civil U&s;e in mo&s;t Countries, was exactly 360 Days, con&s;i&s;t|ing

of 12 equal Months of 30 Days apiece; 'Tis a &s;trong Pre&s;umption, that the <HI>Antedilu|vian</HI> Civil Year was of the &s;ame Length. For it cannot ea&s;ily be imagin'd, how this Year &s;hould &s;o univer&s;ally obtain <HI>after</HI> the Deluge, except it had been in U&s;e <HI>before</HI> it; e&s;pecially, &s;ince it is neither equal to the pre&s;ent <HI>Solar</HI> Year, nor to the <HI>Lunar</HI>. If the fir&s;t Nations after the Deluge had made any Change in their Year, they would certainly have endeavour'd to make it conformable to the Motions, either of the Sun, or of the Moon, or both; which ap|pears to be the Practice of every Nation, when they undertake to correct or alter the Year in civil U&s;e. And therefore, &s;ince neither the Year of 360 Days, nor the Month of 30 Days, is agree|able to any of the Cele&s;tial Motions; it mu&s;t be granted, that the <HI>Po&s;tdiluvians</HI> were not the fir&s;t Framers of this Year, and therefore, that it was us'd <HI>before</HI> the Deluge al&s;o.</P>

The&s;e Circum&s;tances are &s;o agreeable to the Scripture-Hi&s;tory of the Deluge, that many have been tempted to think that <HI>Bero&s;us</HI> Tran&s;crib'd this Account from thence. But that cannot ea&s;ily be; becau&s;e among&s;t the&s;e Truths, there are &s;ome Mi&s;takes and Fal&s;ities intermixt, which I thought it not worth the while to relate. But from tho&s;e Fal|&s;ities, and from the Idolatry in this Hi&s;tory, it ap|pears, that it was collected and put into Writing &s;ome few Years after the Deluge, namely, after the Ri&s;e of Idolatry among&s;t the <HI>Po&s;tdiluvians</HI>. And yet, 'tis very probable, this was done long before the Lives of Men were fix'd to the pre&s;ent Standard, while &s;ome that had convers'd with the Sons or Grand&s;ons of <HI>Noah</HI> were &s;till alive; becau&s;e the Particulars of the Deluge are more accurately related therein, as we have &s;een, than could be &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ible, had the Tradition pa&s;s'd through very many Hands before it was committed to Writing.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) That the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Year was ju&s;t 360 Days long, appears from the Reigns of the&s;e <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Kings, which, as I &s;aid, are not reckon'd by <HI>Years</HI>, but by <HI>Sari</HI>. And our Au|thors
<PB N="166" REF="272">
tell us, <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Syncel. pag. 17. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Vide &amp; Syncel. p. 32.

B.</NOTE> Writers under&s;tood 'em,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> Syn|cel. p. 18.</NOTE> and as appears by the great Length of the particular Reigns, &s;ome of 'em amounting even to 18 <HI>Sari</HI> apiece) 3600 Days, or ten Years of 360 Days each. And the <HI>Hebrew</HI> or <HI>Chaldee</HI> Ex|pre&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Sarus</HI> confirms this A&s;&s;ertion. <HI>Hha|s&aacute;r</HI> is <HI>Ten</HI>; and the fir&s;t Letter being &s;uch a Gut|tural as could not well be pronounced by the <HI>Greeks</HI>, they would naturally expre&s;s the Word by <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which is therefore literally a <HI>Decad</HI>. For the Lives of the <HI>Antediluvians</HI> being gene|rally at the lea&s;t <HI>Ten times</HI> as long as ours, they found it more convenient to reckon their own Lives and the Reigns of their Kings, rather by <HI>Decads</HI> of Years, than by &s;ingle <HI>Years</HI>. Now if a <HI>Sarus</HI>, or <HI>Decad</HI> of Years, contain'd 3600 Days before the Deluge; 'tis plain, that each Year con|tain'd ju&s;t 360 Days.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) If it be proved by the preceding Ar|guments, that the <HI>Civil</HI> Year before the Deluge was ju&s;t 360 Days, and the Civil Month ju&s;t 30 Days; 'twill be thence very probably con|cluded, that both the <HI>Tropical</HI> Year, and the <HI>Lunar</HI> Month, were each of the &s;ame Length re|&s;pectively. The great Probability of this will appear, whether we &s;uppo&s;e the Civil Year and Month to have been of <HI>Human</HI>, or of <HI>Divine</HI> In|&s;titution. For, 1<HI>&s;t</HI>, if they were of <HI>Human</HI> In|&s;titution, what could induce the <HI>Antediluvians</HI> to make u&s;e of this Form of Year, if it varied
<PB N="167" REF="273">
as much from the Motions both of the Sun and Moon, as it does at pre&s;ent? The <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Earth was extreamly fruitful, the Lives of its Inhabitants extreamly long, and the Air at that Time extreamly clear; So that the Inhabitants of the Old World wanted neither Lei&s;ure, nor Time, nor Opportunity, to make Multitudes of Ob&s;ervations, in order to di&s;cover the true Length of the Year and Month: Which if they had di&s;cover'd, the great Conveniencies vi&s;ibly con|&s;equent upon the U&s;e of 'em, mu&s;t needs have induced the Civil Powers to have enjoin'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd 'em accordingly. Now, &s;ince it ap|pears by the former Arguments, that, in fact, the <HI>Civil Year</HI> before the Deluge was ju&s;t 360 Days, and the Civil <HI>Month</HI> ju&s;t 30 Days; 'twill be highly probable, from what is here alledg'd, that (if the &s;ame Civil Year and Month were of <HI>Human</HI> Di&s;covery and In&s;titution) the <HI>Tro|pical</HI> Year and <HI>Lunar</HI> Month were of the &s;ame Length al&s;o. But, 2<HI>dly</HI>, if, on the other hand, God him&s;elf reveal'd to Mankind the true Length of the Year; 'twill be &s;till more evident, that the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Tropical Year was exact|ly 360 Days long, and the Lunar Month exact|ly 30 Days: For God cannot deceive his Crea|tures; nor would he in&s;titute a Form of Year which was <HI>le&s;s</HI> convenient and proper for at|taining the End for which it was in&s;tituted, when nothing hinder'd but that the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> conve|nient and <HI>mo&s;t</HI> proper, that is, the true Tropi|cal Year and Lunar Month, might have been as ea&s;ily a&s;certain'd by Divine Revelation, as any others. Since therefore 'tis before prov'd, that the Civil Year was ju&s;t 360 Days be|fore the Deluge, and the Civil Month ju&s;t 30 Days; if God taught Mankind this Length of
<PB N="168" REF="274">
the Year and Month; then it plainly appears, that the Tropical Year and Lunar Month were ju&s;t 360 and 30 Days long re&s;pectively. And upon the whole, whether the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Civil Year and Month were of <HI>Divine</HI> or of <HI>Human</HI> Ori|ginal (and of one of the two they certainly were;) It appears either way highly probable, that both the Tropical and Lunar Year were ju&s;t 360 Days each, and the Lunar Month exactly 30 Days.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) And that the Primitive <HI>Solar Year</HI> was really no more than 360 <HI>Days</HI>, and contain'd ju&s;t 12 <HI>Lunar Months</HI> of 30 Days apiece, ap|pears farther, by the <HI>mo&s;t ancient Divi&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Solar Cour&s;e</HI> into ju&s;t 360 <HI>Degrees</HI>, and tho&s;e di&s;tributed into 12 <HI>Signs</HI> of 30 Degrees apiece. For the only Natural Rea&s;on that can be given, why the Zodiack or Solar Circle was at fir&s;t di|vided either into ju&s;t 360 Degrees, or 12 Signs, and why ju&s;t 30 Degrees were allotted to each Sign, mu&s;t be, That when this Divi&s;ion was made, the Sun ran through the Zodiack in ju&s;t 360 Days, which were al&s;o 12 Lunar Months, 30 Days being then the exact Length of every Month. And this Divi&s;ion of the Zodiack or Solar Circle into 360 Degrees, was &s;o very famous and remarkable in old Time, that A&s;tronomers and all other Ma|thematicians have transferr'd that Number of Degrees to every other Circle which they con&s;i|der'd; and have &s;till &s;uppos'd 'em divided, eve|ry one, great and &s;mall, into 360 Degrees. And this Divi&s;ion of a Circle has continued ever &s;ince to this Day, as a &s;tanding Memorial of that mo&s;t Ancient Tropical Year which obtain'd when this Divi&s;ion was made. I called this Divi&s;ion of the Zodiack a <HI>mo&s;t ancient</HI> one, be|cau&s;e it appears to have been made long before the earlie&s;t Accounts of A&s;tronomy that we have;
<PB N="169" REF="275">
they all &s;till &s;uppo&s;ing it, and not at all mention|ing any thing of its fir&s;t Introduction. And &s;ince this Divi&s;ion was fir&s;t made when the true Solar Year was no more than 360 Days in Length, and contain'd ju&s;t 12 Lunar Months of 30 Days apiece; 'twas therefore older than the Deluge; &s;ince we are pretty certain that, generally &s;peaking, &s;ince the Deluge, the Solar Year has been &s;ome Hours longer than 365 Days, and the Lunar Year &s;ome Hours &s;horter than 355. If then the Zo|diack was thus divided <HI>before</HI> the Deluge, in Cor|re&s;pondence with the true Solar and Lunar Year; 'tis evident, that before the Deluge they were each of 'em ju&s;t 360 Days, and &s;ubdivided into 12 Lunar Months of 30 Days apiece.</P>

<P>That &s;uch a Po&s;ition of a Comet's Orbit, and &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;age by as is here &s;uppos'd, are in them&s;elves po&s;&s;ible, and agreeable to the <HI>Phaeno|mena</HI> of Nature, All competent Judges, who are acquainted with the new and wonderful Di&s;co|veries in A&s;tronomy,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lem.</HI> 45, &amp;c. <HI>prius</HI>.</NOTE> according to the <HI>Lemmata</HI> hereto relating, mu&s;t freely grant.

which had hitherto prov'd &s;o hard, not to &s;ay inexplicable; and could &s;how the exact Coinci|dence of the Particulars with the Sacred Hi&s;tory, and the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature. I thought to be able to proceed &s;o far, was not only more than had been yet done, more than was generally ex|pected ever would be done; but abundantly &s;uf|ficient to the be&s;t of Purpo&s;es, to clear the Holy Scriptures from the Imputations of ill-di&s;po&s;ed Men, and to demon&s;trate the Account of the De|luge to be in every Part neither impo&s;&s;ible nor unphilo&s;ophical. But proceeding in &s;ome farther Thoughts and Calculations on the &s;aid <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, to my exceeding great Content and Admiration, I found all Things to corre&s;pond &s;o &s;trangely, and the Time of the Year by &s;everal concurring ways to be &s;o exactly fix'd, agreeably to the Sa|cred Hi&s;tory thereby; that, as I &s;aw abundant Rea&s;on my &s;elf to re&s;t &s;atisfied of the Reality, as well as Probability of what I before barely &s;up|pos'd; &s;o I thought the producing the Particu|lars I had di&s;cover'd, might afford Evidence to the Minds of others, and go a great way to the entire E&s;tabli&s;hing the Certainty of that, of who&s;e great Probability the Corre&s;pondence of the &s;everal <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Deluge had before afforded &s;ufficient Satisfaction. But before I come to the Arguments to be here made u&s;e of them|&s;elves, give me leave, by way of Preparation, to &s;hew what Sort of Evidence &s;uch A&s;&s;ertions as this before us, when good and valid, are capable of; and how great or &s;atisfactory it may be in any other, and &s;o may be expected to be in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.</P>

So that on a clear View of the Truth and Con|nexion of each Link, or Member of the entire Argumentation, the Evidence may &s;till be look'd on as infallible. Propo&s;itions in mix'd Mathe|maticks, as in Opticks, Geography, and A&s;tro|nomy, depending partly on ab&s;tract Mathema|tick Demon&s;trations, and partly on the Ob&s;er|vations of the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature; tho' not arriving to the &s;trict Infallibility of the Evidence with the former Sort, are yet ju&s;tly in mo&s;t Ca&s;es allow'd to be truly certain and indubitable.

And, La&s;tly, To come clo&s;er to the Point, the Knowledge of Cau&s;es is deduc'd from their Effects.

This la&s;t Method is that which our be&s;t of Philo&s;ophers, Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>, has taken in his Demon&s;tration of the Univer&s;al Affection or Property of Bodies, which he calls <HI>Mutual Attraction</HI> or <HI>Gravitation</HI>, and which accordingly he has e&s;tabli&s;h'd beyond Po&s;&s;ibility of Contradi|ction; and this is the &s;ole way of bringing Natu|ral Knowledge to Perfection, and extricating it from the little <HI>Hypothe&s;es</HI>, which, in Defect of true Science, the World has till lately been forc'd to be contented with.</P>
<P>In the Point before us, there are only three po&s;&s;ible Ways of proving the Truth of the A&s;|&s;ertion here laid down.

<Q><PB N="186" REF="292"><HI>The Cau&s;e of the Deluge demon&s;trated.</HI></Q>
<P>Before I proceed to my pre&s;ent <HI>Demon&s;tration of the Cau&s;e of the Deluge</HI>, I mu&s;t premi&s;e this; That in my <HI>New Theory of the Earth</HI>, e&s;pecially as improv'd and corrected in the Second Edition, I have evidently &s;hewn, that in ca&s;e a Comet pa&s;s'd by, before the Earth, in its annual Cour&s;e, on the 17th Day of the Second Month, from the Autumnal Equinox, or <HI>November</HI> 28. in the 2349th Year before the Chri&s;tian Aera, the <HI>Phae|nomena</HI> of Nature and Hi&s;tory, and particularly the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Account of the Deluge of <HI>Noah</HI>, which are no otherwi&s;e to be accounted for, are exactly explain'd; that the Calculations and Proportions, where-ever we can come at them, are on that Hypothe&s;is right, agreeable to one another, to Ancient, e&s;pecially Sacred Hi&s;tory, and to the Sy&s;tem of A&s;tronomy; that there are Traces in ancient Books of a Tradition, that a Comet did appear at the very Beginning of the Deluge; that the very Month and Day menti|on'd by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> for &s;uch its Beginning, is atte&s;ted to by other old Records, and, on this Hypothe|&s;is, by A&s;tronomical Calculations al&s;o: Whence I concluded, that it was mo&s;t highly probable, or rather phy&s;ically demon&s;trable, that a Co|met did pa&s;s by at that Time; and was, under the Conduct of the Divine Providence, and as his In&s;trument in puni&s;hing a wicked World, the Cau&s;e of the Deluge. The only Thing wanting, was, to demon&s;trate from the Period of &s;ome Comet, and its Situation in the Heavens, A|&s;tronomically &s;tated and computed, that &s;uch a Comet did actually come by at that very Time: Which if it could be once &s;hown, the whole mu&s;t be own'd as certain, and demon|&s;trated, and all the natural Corollaries there|from
<PB N="187" REF="293">
mu&s;t be allow'd as true, even by the Ob|&s;tinate and Incredulous. This indeed, at fir&s;t, was look'd upon by me as not at all to be ex|pected; &s;ince we then barely began to know, or rather &s;trongly to conjecture, that Comets did revolve about the Sun in &s;ettled Periods, but without being able to determine any one of tho&s;e Periods. But of late God has &s;o ble&s;s'd the La|bours of the Learned; and this Part of A&s;tro|nomy is &s;o much improv'd, e&s;pecially by the farther Pains and Ob&s;ervations of the great In|ventor him&s;elf, Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>; who&s;e Name will never be forgotten, while Mathematicks and A&s;tronomy are pre&s;erv'd among Mankind; and by the laborious Calculations of the acute Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>, on the Principles laid down by the former; that what was a few Years ago al|mo&s;t de&s;pair'd of, is now in great mea&s;ure di&s;|cover'd, and we know, not only that One Co|met has come round three or four times alrea|dy in later Ages, <HI>viz. A. D.</HI> 1456, 1531, 1607, and 1682, and will no doubt come round again <HI>A. D.</HI> 1758, as making its Period in about 75 Years; that another has probably come round in the &s;ame later Ages twice already, <HI>viz. A. D.</HI> 1532, and 1661; and &s;o is to re|turn <HI>A. D.</HI> 1789, or 1790, as making its Pe|riod in about 129 Years: But, which is the greate&s;t Di&s;covery of all, that the la&s;t mo&s;t remarkable Comet, who&s;e De&s;cent into our Regions has occa&s;ion'd almo&s;t all the modern &s;olid Knowledge we have relating to the whole Cometick Sy&s;tem it &s;elf, has al&s;o &s;everal times been &s;een already, within the Time of certain Records; I mean, in the 44th Year before Chri&s;t, and again <HI>A.

<HI>A. D.</HI> 1106, be&s;ides this its la&s;t Appear|ance <HI>A. D.</HI> 1680; whereby we know that it re|volves in about 575 Years. This la&s;t Comet I may well call the <HI>mo&s;t remarkable one</HI> that ever appear'd; &s;ince be&s;ides the former Con&s;iderati|on, I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew, that it is no other than that very Comet which came by the Earth at the Beginning of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Deluge, and which was the Cau&s;e of the &s;ame. Now con&s;idering the Premi&s;es, I &s;hall only have Occa&s;ion, in or|der to my pre&s;ent De&s;ign, to prove the&s;e five Things concerning it. (1.) That no other of the known Comets could pa&s;s by the Earth at the Beginning of the Deluge. (2.) That this Comet was of the &s;ame Bigne&s;s with that which pa&s;s'd by at that Time. (3.) That its Orbit was then in a due Po&s;ition to pa&s;s by at that Time. (4.) That its de&s;cending Node was then al&s;o in a due Po&s;ition for the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;age by. (5.) That its Period exactly agrees to the &s;ame Time. Or, in &s;hort, that all the known Circum&s;tances of this Comet do corre&s;pond, and that it actu|ally pa&s;s'd by on or about that very Year, and on or about that very Day of the Year when the Deluge began. All which Things I &s;hall demon&s;trate in their Order.</P>
<P N="1">I. None of the other Comets yet known, I mean of the 21 in Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>'s Table and my <HI>So|lar Sy&s;tem</HI>, could be that which pa&s;s'd by the Earth at the Beginning of the Deluge. This appears by the&s;e certain Arguments following.</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>New Theo.</HI> 2d Edit. <HI>Coroll.</HI> 2. <HI>Lem.</HI> 86. &amp; p. 203, 204.</NOTE>(1.) None of them appear to have been of a due Bigne&s;s: For the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Deluge, as I have el&s;ewhere &s;hew'd, require a &s;mall one in Compari&s;on of the Earth; whereas the re&s;t of the Comets &s;eem to have been commonly larger than it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="189" REF="295">(2.) None of their de&s;cending Orbits are duly &s;ituate, I mean between 90 and 100 Degrees from <HI>Aries:</HI> Which Po&s;ition is yet ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary in this Ca&s;e. For the Prece&s;&s;ion of the Equinox, which is about 50 Degrees, added to the 46 Degrees that the Earth was di&s;tant from <HI>Aries</HI> when the Flood began, mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the de&s;cending Orbit of the Comet to be now be|tween 90 and 100 Degrees from <HI>Aries:</HI> At which Place none of the de&s;cending Orbits of the o|ther Comets are now &s;ituate; as Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>'s Ta|ble, and my Solar Sy&s;tem grounded thereon, will readily &s;hew. (3.) None of the other's Nodes are &s;o &s;ituate, as is nece&s;&s;ary to bring the Comet near enough to our Earth; I mean, be|tween 90 or 100 Degrees from <HI>Aries</HI>; and &s;o as to cro&s;s the Plane of the Ecliptick very near to the Di&s;tance of the Earth from the Sun; as is al|&s;o plain from the &s;ame Table and Sy&s;tem. Nay indeed, the wrong Situation of the de&s;cending Or|bits, noted under the la&s;t Head, renders this due Situation of the Nodes plainly impo&s;&s;ible. For it being nece&s;&s;ary, that the Orbit it &s;elf inter&s;ect the Ecliptick it &s;elf in the 17th Degree of <HI>Taurus</HI>; this cannot po&s;&s;ibly be in &s;uch a Situation of the Orbit, as that we have already mention'd to be|long to all the re&s;t of the known Comets. So that the&s;e other Comets were utterly incapable of being in&s;trumental in the Deluge, even tho' their Periods &s;hould any of them agree; which yet we know not that any of them do.</P>
<P N="2">II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ubi &s;upra.</NOTE> This Comet was of the &s;ame Bigne&s;s with that which pa&s;s'd by at that Time; I mean a ve|ry &s;mall one, and only 10 times as large as the Moon. This appears by Mr. <HI>Flam&s;tead</HI>'s Deter|mination of its apparent Diameter, about 20&Prime; when it was nearly as far off as the Sun: Where|as
<PB N="190" REF="296">
he &s;uppo&s;es that of the Moon at the &s;ame Di|&s;tance to be about 6&Prime;. So that if the Allowance be made for that large and den&s;e Part of the At|mo&s;phere, which hides the <HI>Nucleus</HI> or Comet it &s;elf from us, &s;uppo&s;e 7&Prime;, the Diameter of the &s;olid Body it &s;elf will be only 13&Prime;. Now the Cube of 13, or 2197, is to the Cube of 6, or 216, as about 10 to 1. Whence it appears, that this Comet is about 10 times &s;o big as the Moon, or &frac14; &s;o great as the Earth, as the real Comet that occa&s;ion'd the Deluge ought to be.</P>
<P N="3">III. The de&s;cending Part of the Orbit of this Comet was about the 17th Degree of <HI>Taurus</HI> at the Time of the Deluge, as that of the Comet at the Deluge mu&s;t have been. For this de&s;cend|ing Orbit is now in the 2d Degree of <HI>Cancer</HI>; and if we allow 46 Degrees for its apparent Motion &s;ince the Deluge, which is very little different from the real Prece&s;&s;ion of the Equinox, the main, if not only Occa&s;ion of it; it will appear to have been in the 17th Degree of <HI>Taurus</HI> at that Time, according to the foregoing Computation.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The de&s;cending Node of this Comet, which is of the greate&s;t Con&s;ideration here, and liable to the greate&s;t Variety of all, does al&s;o ex|ceeding well agree in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. For this is now in the 3d Degree of <HI>Cancer</HI>; and if we allow, as before, 46 Degrees for its apparent Mo|tion &s;ince the Deluge, or for the real Prece&s;&s;ion of the Equinox, the main, if not only Cau&s;e of it, it will appear to have been in the 17th of <HI>Taurus</HI> at that Time al&s;o. Nay, if we allow the lea&s;t Inequality in the&s;e two Motions, or the lea&s;t Al|teration of the Planes either of the Ecliptick or of the Comet's Orbit, or of both, as we ju&s;tly may,
<PB N="191" REF="297">
both from the Phy&s;ical Cau&s;es, and A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations, we may &s;uppo&s;e them &s;till nearer the Earth's Di&s;tance from the Sun, and &s;o more exactly &s;uitable to the Ca&s;e of the Deluge.</P>
<P N="5">V. The Period of this Comet mo&s;t exactly agrees to the &s;ame Time, I mean to 7 Revolutions in 4028 Years, the Interval from the Deluge till its la&s;t Appearance 1680. For,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Princip.</HI> 2<HI>d Edit.</HI> p. 465.</NOTE> as Sir <HI>I&s;aac New|ton</HI> fir&s;t ob&s;erv'd, from its Elliptick Curvature before it di&s;appear'd, that its Period mu&s;t be in general above 500 Years; &s;o has he and Dr. <HI>Hal|ley</HI> &s;ince ob&s;erv'd, that the &s;ame Comet has been &s;een four times; <HI>viz.</HI> the 44th Year before Chri&s;t; <HI>A. D.</HI> 531 or 532, <HI>A. D.</HI> 1106, and <HI>A. D.</HI> 1680; and that by con&s;equence, it makes a Revolution in about 575 Years. Now if we make but a very &s;mall Allowance for the old Periods before Chri&s;t, and &s;uppo&s;e that, one with another, it has revolv'd in 575&frac12; Years, we &s;hall find that 7 &s;uch Periods amount to 4028 Years, exactly, according to that Number &s;ince the Deluge. This is &s;o remarkable an Ob&s;ervation, and &s;o &s;urprizing, that it will de&s;erve a particular Demon&s;tration from the ori|ginal Authors them&s;elves.

<Q>&startq;On tho&s;e ve|ry Days, &s;ays <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>, when I was exhibiting &s;ome Games to the People, [begun about <HI>Sept.</HI> 26.] a Comet appear'd for 7 Days, and was &s;een in the <HI>Northern</HI> Part of Heaven. It ro&s;e about
<PB N="192" REF="298">
the 11th Hour of the Day: It was a remarkable one, and vi&s;ible all over the World. The com|mon People believ'd, that it &s;ignify'd the Re|ception of the Soul of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> into the Number of the immortal Gods. On which Account, the Image of this Star was added to that Statue repre|&s;enting <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Head, which we a while after &endq;con&s;ecrated in the <HI>Forum</HI>.</Q>
Accordingly it is known, that &s;ome of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Coins have a Star upon them, for a Memorial of this Comet; and ob&s;erva|ble that <HI>Virgil</HI> hints at the &s;ame al&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aeneid. VIII.</NOTE> <HI>Patrium ape|ritur vertice &s;idus. Plutarch</HI>'s, <HI>Seneca</HI>'s, and <HI>Suetoni|us</HI>'s Words are almo&s;t the very &s;ame that are inclu|ded in the Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>, and &s;o need not be di&s;tinctly &s;et down. Only the Time of its Ri|&s;ing is by <HI>Suetonius</HI> &s;et down <HI>about the</HI> 11<HI>th Hour</HI>, without the Words <HI>of the Day</HI>, which the other two have; and its <HI>Northern</HI> Po&s;ition is only men|tion'd by <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> him&s;elf. Now if we interpret the 11th Hour, or 11th Hour of the Day, to be either 11-a-clock before Noon, or an Hour before Sun-&s;et, this will render the whole almo&s;t incredi|ble: it being next to impo&s;&s;ible, that this Comet &s;hould be &s;een in the Day-time. But the <HI>Romans</HI> then accounting Midnight the Beginning of their Day, as is well known by Chronologers, we may reckon this 11th Hour to be 11 at Night, and all will agree to the Comet before us; and it will &s;hew, that as it had been conceal'd by cloudy Wea|ther for &s;ome Time, &s;o it now appear'd a&s;cending from the Sun, with its long and &s;plendid Tail, for a Week before the like cloudy Weather, or the Comet's too great Remotene&s;s render'd it no longer ob&s;ervable. Accordingly the <HI>Northern</HI> Po|&s;ition of this Comet, noted here by <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>, &s;e|cures us &s;till farther, that it mu&s;t have been the &s;ame with that <HI>A.

So that on all the&s;e Accounts, the Comet &s;een then by the <HI>Romans</HI>, and that &s;een <HI>A. D.</HI> 1680, mu&s;t have been one and the &s;ame Comet.

<P>On the Year of our Lord 1106, the 14th of the Calends of <HI>March, [Feb.</HI> 16.] a certain &s;trange Star was di&s;cover'd, and was &s;een to &s;hine between the <HI>South</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> for 25 Days, after the &s;ame manner, and at the &s;ame Hour.

<P>In the&s;e Te&s;timonies, we may &s;ee that all the Circum&s;tances of this Comet agree to that of <HI>A. D.</HI> 1680.

So that there is no Rea&s;on to doubt, but it was the very &s;ame. Only we mu&s;t here note, that the&s;e two Periods were, one with another, three Quarters of a Year &s;horter than the la&s;t Period. For from <HI>September</HI>, in the 44th Year before Chri&s;t, till <HI>February</HI> or <HI>March A.

It is rather a Wonder, that the three la&s;t Periods of our fa|mous Comet are &s;o very nearly equal, than that there is this &s;mall Inequality among them.

<P><Q>&startq;But as far as Probability from the Equality of Periods, and &s;imilar Appearance of Comets, may be urged as an Argument, the late won|drous Comet of 1680/1, &s;eems to have been the &s;ame, which was &s;een in the Time of our King <HI>Henry</HI> I. <HI>Anno</HI> 1106, which began to appear in the <HI>We&s;t</HI> about the middle of <HI>February</HI>, and con|tinued for many Days after, with &s;uch a Tail as was &s;een in that of 1680/1. And again in the Con|&s;ulate of <HI>Lampadius</HI> and <HI>Ore&s;tes</HI>, about the Year of Chri&s;t 531, &s;uch another Comet appear'd in the <HI>We&s;t</HI>, of which <HI>Malela</HI>, perhaps an Eye|witne&s;s, relates, that it was <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, a <HI>great and fearful Star</HI>; that it appear'd in the <HI>We&s;t</HI>, and emitted upwards from it a long white Beam; and was &s;een for 20 Days. It were to be wi&s;h'd, the Hi&s;torian had told us what Time of the Year it was &s;een; but 'tis however plain, that the Interval between this and that of 1106, is nearly equal to that between 1106 and 1680/1, <HI>viz.</HI> about 575 Years. And if we reckon back|ward &s;uch another Period, we &s;hall come to the 44th Year before <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>, in which <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> was murder'd, and in which there ap|pear'd a very remarkable Comet, mention'd by almo&s;t all the Hi&s;torians of tho&s;e Times, and by <HI>Pliny</HI> in his Natural Hi&s;tory, <HI>l.</HI> 11. <HI>c.</HI> 24. who recites the Words of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar</HI> on this Occa&s;ion, which lead us to the very Time of its Appearance, and its Situation in the Hea|vens.

Nor are we to &s;uppo&s;e that it was &s;een only tho&s;e 7 Days, but po&s;&s;ibly both before and after. Nor are we to interpret the Words <HI>&s;ub Septentrionibus</HI>, as if the Comet had appear'd in the <HI>North</HI>, but that it was &s;een under the <HI>&s;eptem triones</HI>, or brighter Stars of <HI>Ur&s;a major</HI>. And as to its Ri&s;ing <HI>hora undecima diei</HI>, it can no ways be under&s;tood, unle&s;s the Word <HI>diei</HI> be left out, as it is by <HI>Suetonius</HI>; for it mu&s;t have been very far from the Sun, either to ri&s;e at 5 in the Af|ternoon, or at 11 at Night; in which Ca&s;es it mu&s;t have appear'd for a long Time, and its Tail have been &s;o little remarkable, that it could by no means be call'd, <HI>Clarum &amp; omnibus Terris con&s;picuum Sydus</HI>. But &s;uppo&s;ing this Comet to have traced the &s;ame Path with that of the Year 1680, the a&s;cending Part of the Orb will exactly repre&s;ent all that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> hath &s;aid con|cerning it; and is yet an additional Argument to that drawn from the Equality of the Peri|od. Thus 'tis not improbable but this Comet may have four times vi&s;ited us at Intervals of about 575 Years: Whence the Tran&s;ver&s;e Diameter of its Elliptick Orb will be found # 575 &times; 575 times greater than the annu|al Orb; or 138 times greater than the mean Di&s;tance of the Sun; which Di&s;tance, tho' immen&s;ely great, bears no Proportion to that &endq;of the fix'd Stars.</Q></P>

<P>In order to the Proof of which, I &s;hall &s;hew fir&s;t in general, that the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Year was different from, nay, &s;horter than the pre&s;ent Year; and afterwards determine the particular Length thereof more exactly; and &s;hall compri&s;e what Rea&s;ons I have for the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions in the following Arguments.</P>

'Tis al&s;o not to be doubted, but the <HI>Po&s;tdiluvians</HI> would have re|tain'd the &s;ame Year, and determin'd it by the &s;ame Number of Days as their Forefathers, had they found it to agree with the Cour&s;e of the Sun and Moon <HI>then</HI>, as it did formerly. But 'tis evi|dent from the anciente&s;t Authors, as has been ju&s;t now prov'd, that 'twas many hundreds of Years after the Deluge, e're the mo&s;t Learned Nati|ons rectify'd their Year to the Sun's Cour&s;e, or arriv'd at more than three hundred and &s;ixty Days in their Accounts. Which Number accor|dingly

was the Mea&s;ure of the Degrees of the Zodiack, or Ecliptick Circle, and thence of all other Circles among the A&s;tronomers; and the Mea&s;ure and Standard of a Year for many Ages; till A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations forc'd Men to cor|rect the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Now all this, on the pre&s;ent <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, is ea&s;y and natural; That when the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Year was ju&s;t 360 Days long, and after the Deluge was in&s;en&s;ibly become above three hundred and &s;ixty five Days, without the lea&s;t Knowledge or Su&s;pi|cion of any Change therein; 'tis, I &s;ay, very ea&s;y and natural in this Ca&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e, that upon their ob&s;erving, in Length of Time, the Sea&s;ons to be protracted, and return &s;till later every Year than other; (as on the retaining the Antediluvi|an Year mu&s;t needs happen,) and con&s;equently their ancient Standard of three hundred and &s;ixty Days, to be too &s;hort for the Sun's Revolution; that they &s;hould lengthen their Accounts to three hundred and &s;ixty five, and at la&s;t to 365&frac14; Days in the whole Year. And indeed, this mo&s;t ancient Adju&s;tment of the Year and Months, with the Degrees of a Circle, and of each Sign in the E|cliptick, was found &s;o ea&s;y, ready, and u&s;eful on all Accounts, that even when the odd five Days were added afterward, they were not in&s;erted into the Months, nor perhaps e&s;teem'd Part of the Year, but look'd upon as <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>adventitious</HI> or <HI>odd Days</HI>, or <HI>Days &s;uperadded</HI> to the old and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Year of the World; as being of a quite different Denomination and Character from all the re&s;t. However, 'tis very agreeable to Rea&s;on and ancient Hi&s;tory, that on the Ob|&s;ervation of the Protraction of the Sea&s;ons, and on the Improvement of A&s;tronomy, the Year &s;hould be increas'd from three hundred and &s;ixty

All this is, I think, ea&s;y and natural in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, upon that <HI>Hy|pothe&s;is</HI> which is here defended; but without it, 'tis very &s;trange and unaccountable.

Which Conclu|&s;ion is farther confirm'd,</P>

By the E&s;&s;ential Difference of the anci|ent Years among &s;everal Nations &s;ince the De|luge: Some of which made u&s;e of <HI>Solar</HI>, and others of <HI>Lunar</HI> ones, or endeavour'd to adju&s;t their Periods to tho&s;e of each of the&s;e Lumina|ries.

Now this E&s;&s;ential Diffe|rence of <HI>Solar</HI> and <HI>Lunar</HI> Years in the elde&s;t An|tiquity after the Flood, is on no other Grounds &s;o accountable, as that the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Year ha|ving been deliver'd down from their Forefathers to have agreed with the Cour&s;es both of the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Moon</HI>, (as on the pre&s;ent <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> it really did) &s;ome Nations followed <HI>one</HI> Branch, and others <HI>another</HI> of the &s;ame Tradition: And when they no longer were commen&s;urate, accommo|dated their Accounts to the one or the other, ac|cording as the one or the other was mo&s;t preva|lent and univer&s;al among them.

For &s;eeing the <HI>Antedi|luvian</HI> Years were ju&s;t 360 <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Days, and yet equal to only 355 Days, 4 Hours, and about 20 Minutes of our pre&s;ent Days, it is plain, that the additional Waters and Matter, deriv'd from the Comet's Atmo&s;phere and Tail at the Deluge, mu&s;t have retarded the Earth's diurnal Motion, and &s;o lengthen'd the Day in that Pro|portion: Which that on an exact Computation it would do, I am now to prove. The Comet, by our pre&s;ent <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, was a little more than a third Part &s;o big as our Earth, or about 6 times as big as the Moon, and came 24 times as near as the Moon; whence the Tide cau&s;ed by it, would, if the Earth were wholly fluid, and the Comet had been all the while at the neare&s;t Di|&s;tance, be equal to 24&times;24&times;24&times;6=82944 times as great as that of the Moon with us; which being about 6 Feet above the mean Elevation; this Tide or Elevation of the longe&s;t <HI>Semidiame|ter</HI> above the mean, would be 497664 Feet, or near 100 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;tatute Miles, <HI>i. e.</HI> about the 40th Part of the whole <HI>Semidiameter</HI>.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Phaenomena</HI> relating to the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> State of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P N="35">XXXV. THE Inhabitants of the Earth were before the Flood va&s;tly more numerous than the pre&s;ent Earth either actually does, or perhaps is capable to con|tain and &s;upply.</P>
<P>In order to the Proof of this A&s;&s;ertion, I ob|&s;erve, (1.) That the Po&s;terity of Each Gene|ration of the <HI>Antediluvians</HI>, is to be &s;uppos'd much more numerous than of any &s;ince, be|cau&s;e their Lives were much longer. This is but agreeable to the &s;acred Hi&s;tory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. v.15.21. ver. 12. ver. 32.</NOTE> in which we find two at &s;ixty five, and one at &s;eventy Years of Age to have begotten Children: While the three Sons of <HI>Noah</HI> were not begotten till af|ter their Father's five hundredth year: Where|as yet at the &s;ame time the &s;everal Children of the &s;ame Father appear to have &s;ucceeded as quickly one after another as they u&s;ually do at this day. For as to <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>A$el</HI>, they appear to have been pretty near of an Age, the World being at the death of the latter, not without con&s;iderable numbers of People, tho' their Father <HI>Adam</HI> was not then an hundred and thirty Years old;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. iv.14, 15. <HI>with</HI> 25.</NOTE> and &s;o in Probability contain'd many of the Po&s;terity of both of them. (Which by the way fully e&s;tabli&s;hes the early begetting of Children ju&s;t now ob&s;erv'd in the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Patriarchs,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid. Cap.</HI> vii.13. <HI>with</HI> v.31.</NOTE> and if rightly con&s;ider'd, overturns a main Argument for the <HI>Septuagini</HI>'s Addition of &s;o many Centena|ries
<PB N="247" REF="353">
in the Generations before the Deluge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. v.32. &amp; vii.11. &amp; viii.13. <HI>with</HI> xi.10.</NOTE>) And as to the three Sons of <HI>Noah</HI>, born after the five hundredth Year of their Father's Life, 'tis evident that two of them at the lea&s;t, <HI>Japhet</HI> and <HI>Shem</HI>, were born within two Years one after another. All which makes it highly rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ince the Lives of the Antedi|luvians were much longer, their Po&s;terity mu&s;t have been much more numerous than that of the Po&s;tdiluvians. (2.) The Lives of the Antedi|luvians being pretty evenly prolong'd without that mighty inequality in the Periods of hu|man Life, which we now experience, and com|monly amounting to 800 Years at the lea&s;t, whereas the Modern Age of Men at the utmo&s;t is not 80, the proportion between the Lives of the Antediluvians and tho&s;e of the Po&s;tdi|luvians, mu&s;t at lea&s;t be taken as about 10 to 1. And accordingly in any long &s;pace, the An|tediluvians mu&s;t double them&s;elves at the lea&s;t, in about the tenth part of the time in which they now double them&s;elves. (3.) On account of the <HI>Coexi&s;tence</HI> of &s;o many of &s;uch Generations as are but &s;ucce&s;&s;ive with us, we mu&s;t allow the Antediluvian number of the pre&s;ent Inhabitants to have been &s;o much greater than it would o|therwi&s;e have been, as to &s;upply any defect which might ari&s;e from any other Circum|&s;tances not here particularly con&s;ider'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Sir <HI>Will. Pet|ty</HI>'s E&s;&s;ay on the Mul|tiplication of Man|kind: And Philo&s;. Tran&s;act. <HI>N. 196, P. 597, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> So that on all accounts the before-mention'd pro|portion for the doubling them&s;elves ought to be e&s;teem'd a very fair and moderate one in this ca&s;e; which <HI>Praecognita</HI> &s;uppos'd, in order to the proof of this A&s;&s;ertion I ob&s;erve, That 'tis now generally own'd, and this from good Ob&s;ervati|ons, that Mankind do double them&s;elves in about 360 or 370 Years; or, allowance being made for
<PB N="248" REF="354">
all but very uncommon, and very rare Ca&s;es of general Wars, Famines, Plagues and &s;uch like &s;weeping De&s;olations, in about 400 Years; which therefore is to be &s;uppos'd the proportion ever &s;ince the pre&s;ent Period of human Life was fix'd in the Days of <HI>David</HI>. 'Tis al&s;o evident that from the Creation till the Deluge, the Lives of Men were at the lea&s;t ten times as long as they have been in the&s;e latter Ages of the World, as was ju&s;t now ob&s;erv'd; 'tis therefore evident that the Period for the Doubling of Mankind, from the Creation till the Deluge, mu&s;t have been a|bout ten times &s;horter than that which has of late obtain'd in the World, by rea&s;on of their ancient longer Lives in that proportion; &s;o that if we have a <HI>Series</HI> of 40 Numbers beginning at 2 (for &s;o many God created him&s;elf at fir&s;t;) and doubling them&s;elves in 40, or for conveni|ence 41 Years in a mean, or one Age with another till the Deluge, <HI>i. e.</HI> for about 1556 or 1656 Years, we &s;hall in &s;ome degree obtain the &s;um total of Mankind at the Deluge, and al&s;o in the &s;everal Ages before that time. (Tho' &s;till this Period of doubling, mu&s;t have been much <HI>&s;horter</HI> and <HI>lon|ger</HI> in the <HI>earlie&s;t</HI> and <HI>late&s;t</HI> times of the &s;aid In|terval.)

<P><HI>Scholium.</HI> Since we have here &s;uppos'd that the general Standard for the doubling of Mankind in the&s;e latter Ages of the World is about 400 Years, allowance being therein made for all but very un|common and very rare Ca&s;es of general Wars, Famines, Plagues, and &s;uch like &s;weeping De&s;o|lations; and &s;ince we have al&s;o &s;uppos'd that the Period of Doubling mu&s;t &s;till be &s;o much &s;horter, as the Lives of Men in different Ages appear to be longer, It will be proper and u&s;eful in this place to examine this Matter a little farther, and to confirm both parts of the pre&s;ent <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> by comparing it with the utmo&s;t Ancient and Authen|tick, nay indeed, with the only Ancient and Au|thentick Account of this matter we have in the World; and that is with the time of Doubling among the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from their Entrance into the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI>, till the time of King <HI>David</HI>; at both which points of Time their Num|bers were exactly taken, and are as exactly Re|corded

<P N="46">XLVI. IN the Sixteenth or Seventeenth Century from the Creation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Grot. ubi &s;upra. Bp. <HI>Stilling-fleet</HI>'s Orig. l. 3. c. 4. <HI>Edward</HI>'s Authori|ty of Scrip. p. 118, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And Com|mentators on Gen. 6, and 7.</NOTE> there happen'd a mo&s;t extraordinary and prodigi|ous Deluge of Waters upon the Earth.</P>
<P>This general A&s;&s;ertion is not only atte&s;ted by a large and &s;pecial Account of it in the Sacred Writings, but by the univer&s;al Con&s;ent of the mo&s;t ancient Records of all Nations be&s;ides, as may be &s;een in the Authors quoted in the Mar|gin; and is put moreover pa&s;t doubt by Dr. <HI>Wood|ward</HI>'s Natural Ob&s;ervations <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">E&s;&s;ay, Pref and Part 3. Sect&middot; 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. This prodigious Deluge of Wa|ters was in part occa&s;ion'd by a mo&s;t extra|ordinary and violent Rain, for the &s;pace of forty Days, and as many Nights, without Intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Yet &s;even Days,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vij 4.</NOTE> <HI>and I will cau&s;e it to rain upon the Earth forty Days and forty Nights.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Windows of heaven were opened, and the rain was upon the Earth forty Days and forty Nights.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver&s;e 11, 12.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>And the Flood was forty Days upon the Earth.</HI></P>
<P N="48">XLVIII. This va&s;t quantity of Waters was not deriv'd from the Earth or Seas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver&s;e 17.</NOTE> as Rains con&s;tantly now are; but from &s;ome other Superior and Coele&s;tial Original.</P>
<P>This is evident, Becau&s;e (1.) the Antediluvian Air (as was before prov'd,) never retain'd great
<PB N="264" REF="370">
Quantities of Vapours, or &s;u&s;tained any Clouds capable of producing &s;uch con&s;iderable, and &s;o la&s;ting a Rain, as this mo&s;t certainly was. (2.) The Quantity of Waters on the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Earth, where there was no Ocean, (as we &s;aw ju&s;t now) was very &s;mall in compari&s;on of that at pre&s;ent, and &s;o could contribute very little towards the Deluge. (3.) If the Quantity of Waters on the Face of the Earth had then been as great as now, and had all been elevated into Vapours and de&s;cend|ed on the dry Land alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Th. l. 1. c. 2.</NOTE> it were much too &s;mall to cau&s;e &s;uch a Deluge as this was. (4.) But becau&s;e, if the Waters were all rais'd into Vapours, and de&s;cended into Rain, they mu&s;t either fall upon, or run down into the Ocean, the Seas, and tho&s;e Declivities they were in before, They could only take up and po&s;&s;e&s;s their old places; They there|fore could not contribute a jot to that &s;tanding and permanent Ma&s;s of Waters which cover'd the Earth at the Deluge. (5.) The Expre&s;&s;ion us'd by the Sacred Hi&s;torian, that the <HI>Windows, Flood|gates</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vii.11. And viii.2.</NOTE> or <HI>Cataracts</HI> of Heaven were open'd at the fir&s;t falling, and &s;hut at the cea&s;ing of the&s;e Wa|ters, very naturally agrees to this Superior and Coele&s;tial Original.</P>
<P N="49">XLIX. This va&s;t fall of Waters, or Forty Days rain, began either on the &s;ixth Day of the Week, or <HI>Friday</HI> the twenty eighth day of <HI>November</HI>, according to the pre&s;ent <HI>He|brew</HI> Chronology; or on <HI>Monday December</HI> 2d according to the exacter Chronology, be|ing the &s;eventeenth Day of the &s;econd Month from the <HI>Autumnal Equinox</HI>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vii.11.</NOTE><HI>In the &s;ix hundredth Year of</HI> Noah'<HI>s Life, in the &s;econd Month, the &s;eventeenth Day of the Month, the Windows of Heaven were opened, and the Rain was upon the Earth forty Days and forty Nights.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="371">Thus <HI>Abydenus</HI> and <HI>Bero&s;us</HI> &s;ay it began on the fifteenth Day of <HI>De&s;ius</HI>, the &s;econd Month from the <HI>Vernal Equinox</HI>; which, if the mi&s;take,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Langi&ugrave;s de annis Chri|&s;ti, <HI>p. 255.</HI></NOTE> ari&s;ing 'tis probable from the ignorance of the change in the beginning of the Year at the <HI>Exodus</HI> out of <HI>Egypt</HI>, or perhaps from the Copyers alone, by putting <HI>De&s;ius</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Dius</HI> which was the &s;e|cond Month from the Autumnal Equinox, be but corrected, is within a Day or two agreeable to the Narration of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>, and &s;o exceedingly con|firms the &s;ame. Thus al&s;o, what is &s;till more remarkable, <HI>Plutarch</HI> tells us that <HI>O&s;iris</HI>, or <HI>No|ah</HI> went into the Ark exactly on the 17th Day of the Month <HI>Athyr</HI>, in which the Sun pa&s;&s;es through the Sign <HI>Scorpius</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 124, 125. prius.</NOTE> or the very &s;ame 17th Day of the &s;econd Month from the Autumnal Equinox which we here a&s;&s;ign, and which the Sacred Hi|&s;tory a&s;&s;erts; as we have already &s;een.</P>
<P N="50">L. The other main Cau&s;e of the Deluge, was the breaking up the Fountains of the great <HI>Aby&s;s</HI>, or the cau&s;ing of &s;uch Chaps and Fi&s;&s;ures in the upper Earth, as might permit the Waters contain'd in the Bowels of it, when violently pre&s;s'd and &s;queez'd upwards, to a&s;cend, and &s;o add to the quantity of tho&s;e which the Rains produ|ced.</P>
<P><HI>All the Fountains of the great deep were broken up.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vii.11.</NOTE></P>
<P N="51">LI. All the&s;e Fountains of the great Deep were broken up on the very fir&s;t Day of the Deluge; or the very fir&s;t Day when the Rains began.</P>
<P><HI>In the &s;ix hundredth Year of</HI> Noah'<HI>s Life,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vii.11.</NOTE> <HI>in the &s;e|cond Month, the &s;eventeenth Day of the Month, the &s;ame Day were all the Fountains of the great Deep
<PB N="266" REF="372">
broken up, and the Windows of Heaven were opened.</HI></P>
<P N="52">LII. Yet the very &s;ame Day, <HI>Noah</HI>, his Family, and all the Animals entred into the Ark.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vij.13, 14.</NOTE><HI>In the &s;elf-&s;ame Day</HI>, la&s;t mention'd, <HI>entred</HI> Noah, <HI>and</HI> Shem, <HI>and</HI> Ham, <HI>and</HI> Japheth, <HI>the Sons of</HI> Noah, <HI>and</HI> Noah'<HI>s Wife, and the three Wives of his Sons with them into the Ark: They, and every Bea&s;t after his kind, and all the Cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth after his kind, and every Fowl after his kind, every Bird of every &s;ort.</HI></P>
<P N="53">LIII. The Waters of the Deluge in|creas'd by degrees five Months till their ut|mo&s;t height; and then decreas'd by degrees &s;till longer till they were clearly gone off the face of the Earth.</P>
<P>This is evident from the entire <HI>Series</HI> and cour&s;e of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory, in the &s;eventh and eighth Chapters of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI>.</P>
<P N="54">LIV. The Waters of the Deluge were Still, Calm, free from Commotions, Storms, Winds, and Tempe&s;ts of all &s;orts, during the whole time in which the <HI>Ark</HI> was afloat upon them.</P>
<P>This is evident from the Impo&s;&s;ibility of the <HI>Ark</HI>'s abiding a &s;tormy Sea, con&s;idering the va&s;t Bulk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vi.15.</NOTE> and particular Figure of it. For &s;ince it was three hundred Cubits long, fifty Cubits broad, and thirty Cubits high; which is, ac|cording to the mo&s;t accurate Determination of the Cubits Length, by the Right Reverend the Lord Bi&s;hop of <HI>Peterborough</HI>, above five hundred
<PB N="267" REF="373">
and forty &s;even <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Feet long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bi&s;hop <HI>Cumber|land</HI>'s Weights and Mea|&s;ures, p. 34.</NOTE> above ninety one Feet broad, and near fifty five Feet high: And &s;ince withal it appears to have been of the Figure of a Che&s;t, without &s;uch a peculiar Bot|tom, and Proportion of Parts, as our great Ships are contrived with; 'tis evident, and will be al|low'd by Per&s;ons skill'd in Navigation, that 'twas not capable of enduring a &s;tormy Sea. It mu&s;t, whenever either the Ridges or Hollows of va&s;t Waves were &s;o &s;ituate, that it lay over cro&s;s the one or the other, have had its back broken, and it &s;elf mu&s;t have been &s;hatter'd to pieces; which having not happen'd, 'tis a certain evi|dence of a calm Sea during the whole time it was afloat.</P>
<P N="55">LV. Yet during the latter part of the De|luge, there was a con&s;iderable Wind, if not Storms and Tempe&s;ts al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>God made a wind to pa&s;s over the Earth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. viii.1.</NOTE> <HI>and the waters a&s;&s;waged.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thou covered&s;t the Earth with the deep,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;alm civ.6, 7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>as with a garment; the waters &s;tood above the mountains. At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they ha&s;ted away. They go up to the mountains;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Philoo nis de&s;crip|tionem Di|luvii apud Burnetium Archaeol. <HI>p. 236.</HI></NOTE> <HI>they go down by the vallies, unto the place which thou ha&s;t appointed for them.</HI></P>
<P N="56">LVI. This Deluge of Waters was Uni|ver&s;al in its extent and effect; reaching to all the parts of the Earth, and de&s;troying all the Land-animals on the entire Surface thereof; tho&s;e only excepted which were with <HI>Noah</HI> in the Ark.</P>
<P>The following Texts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI>, Pref. and Part 3. Sect. 2. Vid. Th. l. 1. c. 3.</NOTE> e&s;pecially if compar'd with the thirty fifth foregoing <HI>Phaenomenon</HI>, and added to Dr. <HI>Woodward</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations atte&s;ting
<PB N="268" REF="374">
the &s;ame thing, will put this A&s;&s;ertion beyond ra|tional Exception.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vi.13.</NOTE><HI>God looked upon the earth, and behold it was cor|rupt; for all fle&s;h had corrupted his way upon the earth. And God &s;aid unto</HI> Noah, <HI>The end of all fle&s;h is come before me</HI>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver&s;e 17.</NOTE><HI>Behold, I even I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to de&s;troy all fle&s;h, wherein is the breath of life from under heaven: and every thing that is in the earth &s;hall die.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. vii.4. Ver&s;e 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.</NOTE><HI>Every living &s;ub&s;tance that I have made, will I de&s;troy from off the face of the earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered. &mdash; And all fle&s;h died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of bea&s;t, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth, and every man. All in who&s;e no&s;trils was the breath of life; all that was in the dry land died. And every living &s;ub&s;tance was de&s;troyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle, and the creeping thing, and the fowl of the heaven, and they were de&s;troyed from the Earth; and</HI> Noah <HI>only remained alive, and they that were with him in the Ark.</HI></P>
<P N="57">LVII. The Waters at their utmo&s;t height were fifteen Cubits above the highe&s;t Moun|tains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Va|ren. Geog. p. 60.</NOTE> or about 3 Miles above the neighbour|ing Plains, or 6 Miles above the common Surface of the Earth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vii.16, 20.</NOTE><HI>All the high hills under the whole heaven were co|vered. Fifteen cubits upwards did the waters pre|vail, and the mountains were covered.</HI></P>
<P N="58">LVIII. Whatever be the height of that <HI>Gordyean</HI> Mountain whereon the <HI>Ark</HI> re&s;ted <HI>Now</HI>; it was <HI>at that time</HI> the highe&s;t of
<PB N="296" REF="375">
all others, at lea&s;t in tho&s;e parts of the World.</P>
<P>This is evident from what has been already ob&s;erv'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Hy|poth. 8. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> That tho' the utmo&s;t height of the Waters were fifteen Cubits above the highe&s;t Mountains, and &s;o many hundreds, nay, thou|&s;ands above the mo&s;t of them; yet did the Ark re&s;t on the very fir&s;t day on which the Wa|ters began to dimini&s;h, more than two Months before the emerging of the tops of the other Mountains; as is evident from the Texts fol|lowing.</P>
<P><HI>The waters prevailed upon the earth</HI> (from the &s;eventeenth day of the &s;econd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vii. ult. (with ver&s;e 11.) chap. viii.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</NOTE> to the &s;eventeenth day of the &s;eventh month) <HI>an hundred and fifty days. And God remembred</HI> Noah, <HI>and all the cat|tle that was with him in the Ark; and God made a wind to pa&s;s over the earth, and the waters a&s;&s;wa|ged. The fountains al&s;o of the deep, and the windows of heaven were &s;topped, and the rain from heaven was re&s;trained. And the waters returned from off the earth continually, and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. And the Ark re&s;ted in the &s;eventh month, on the &s;eventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of</HI> Ararat. <HI>And the waters decrea&s;ed continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the fir&s;t day of the month, were the tops of the mountains &s;een.</HI></P>
<P N="59">LIX. As the Fountains of the great Deep were broken up at the very beginning of the Deluge, &s;o were they &s;topp'd at the end of 150 Days, on the &s;eventeenth Day of the &s;eventh Month.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. viii.2.</NOTE></P>

To which latter al&s;o the Wind, by hurrying the Wa|ters up and down, and &s;o promoting their lighting into the beforemention'd Fi&s;&s;ures, was very much &s;ub&s;ervient.</P>

Thou ha&s;t &s;et a bound that they may not pa&s;s, that they turn not again to cover the earth.</HI></P>
<P N="61">LXI. The <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Year was, in ab&s;olute &s;pace of time, nearly equal to our pre&s;ent and Ancient Lunar one, or above 10 Days &s;horter than our pre&s;ent Solar Year.</P>
<P>This has been prov'd under the XI. <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> already.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P 193, &amp; c. pri&ugrave;s</NOTE></P>
<P N="62"><PB N="271" REF="377">LXII. Yet the <HI>Antediluvians</HI> had, ge|nerally &s;peaking, full 360 Days in their Year.</P>
<P>This has been al&s;o prov'd in the X. <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> already.</P>
<P N="63">LXIII. The dry Land, or habitable Part of the Globe, is, &s;ince the Deluge, divided into two va&s;t <HI>Continents</HI>, almo&s;t op|po&s;ite to one another, which, as is mo&s;t pro|bable, are &s;eparated by a great Ocean inter|pos'd between them.</P>
<P>This every Map of the Earth is a &s;ufficient Proof of.</P>
<P N="64">LXIV. One of the&s;e <HI>Continents</HI> is con&s;i|derably larger than the other.</P>
<P>This is evident the &s;ame way with the for|mer.</P>
<P N="65">LXV. The larger <HI>Continent</HI> lies mo&s;t part on the <HI>North-&s;ide</HI> of the Equator, and the &s;maller, as far as is yet certainly known, mo&s;t part on the <HI>South</HI>.</P>
<P>This (if we take <HI>South-America</HI>, the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable and entire Branch of the whole, for the <HI>Continent</HI> here referr'd to, as 'tis rea&s;onable to do) is al&s;o evident the &s;ame way with the for|mer.</P>
<P N="66">LXVI. The Middle or Center of the <HI>North-Continent</HI>, between the utmo&s;t bounds, <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South, Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI>, is about &s;ixteen or eighteen degrees of <HI>Northern</HI> Latitude; and that of the <HI>South</HI> about &s;ixteen or eighteen degrees of <HI>Southern</HI> La|titude.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="378">This may &s;oon be found by mea&s;uring the Boundaries of the &s;everal <HI>Continents</HI> on a Globe or Map, and ob&s;erving the Po&s;ition of their Centers.</P>
<P N="67">LXVII. The di&s;tance between the <HI>Con|tinents</HI>, mea&s;uring from the larger or <HI>Nor|thern South-Ea&s;tward</HI>, is greater than that the contrary way, or <HI>South-We&s;tward</HI>.</P>
<P>This is evident by the like means with the former: It being farther from <HI>China</HI>, or the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> to <HI>America</HI> going forward <HI>South-Ea&s;t</HI>, than from <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>Africa</HI> going thither <HI>South-We&s;t</HI>.</P>
<P N="68">LXVIII. Neither of the <HI>Continents</HI> is terminated by a round or even circular Cir|cumference: But mighty Creeks, Bays, and Seas running into them; and as mighty Penin&s;ula's, Promontories, and Rocks jetting out from them, render the whole very une|qual and irregular.</P>
<P>This none who ever &s;aw a Globe or Map of the World can be ignorant of.</P>
<P N="69">LXIX. The depth of that <HI>Ocean</HI> which &s;eparates the&s;e two <HI>Continents</HI> is u&s;ually greate&s;t farthe&s;t from, and lea&s;t neare&s;t to either of the &s;ame <HI>Continents</HI>; there being a gradual de&s;eent from the <HI>Continents</HI> to the middle of the <HI>Ocean</HI>; which is the deepe&s;t of all.</P>
<P>This is a Propo&s;ition very well known in Na|vigation; and in &s;everal Sea-<HI>Charts</HI> relating thereto, may ea&s;ily be ob&s;erv'd.</P>

<P N="71">LXXI. The Ages of Men decreas'd about one half pre&s;ently after the Deluge; and in the &s;ucceeding 1300 Years were gradually reduced to that &s;tandard at which they have &s;tood ever &s;ince.</P>

the &s;ame; is in &s;ome things &s;o little con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Relation, and the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Na|ture; and upon the whole is &s;o much more than his Ob&s;ervations require, or will warrant, that I cannot but di&s;&s;ent from this particular Hypothe&s;is, tho' I &s;o ju&s;tly honour the <HI>Author</HI>, and &s;o highly e&s;teem, and frequently refer to the <HI>Work</HI> it &s;elf.

<P N="1">I. All tho&s;e particular &s;mall Bodies, of which our ha|bitable Earth is now compos'd, were originally in a mixed, confu&s;ed, fluid, and uncertain Condition, with|out any Order or Regularity. It was an <HI>Earth without form, and void</HI>; had <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> &s;pread over <HI>the face of its Aby&s;s</HI>; and in reality was, what it has been ever &s;til'd, a perfect <HI>Chaos</HI>.</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hypoth. <HI>1.</HI> prius.</NOTE>I. THIS has been already &s;ufficiently ac|counted for, and need not be here a|gain in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>

<PB N="293" REF="399">
on the Divine Power; but was the proper effect of the Influence and Interpo&s;ition, and all along under the peculiar Care and Providence of God.</P>
<P N="2">II. 'Tis not very ea&s;y, I confe&s;s, in &s;uch mighty Turns and Changes of the World, exactly to determine how far, and in what particulars, a &s;upernatural or miraculous Interpo&s;ition of the Divine Power is concern'd; and how far the Laws of Nature, or Mechanical Powers ought to be extended. Nay indeed, 'tis diffi|cult enough, in &s;everal in&s;tances to determine what is the effect of a natural and ordinary, and what of a &s;upernatural and extraordinary Pro|vidence. 'Tis now evident, that <HI>Gravity</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. <HI>Lem.</HI> 9. <HI>cum Co|roll. prius.</HI> And Dr. <HI>Bentley</HI>, Serm. 7. p. 26, &amp;c.</NOTE> the mo&s;t mechanical Affection of Bodies, and which &s;eems mo&s;t natural, depends entirely on the con|&s;tant and efficacious, and, if you will, the &s;u|pernatural and miraculous Influence of Almighty God. And I do not know whether the falling of a Stone to the Earth ought not more truly to be e&s;teem'd a <HI>&s;upernatural Effect</HI>, or a <HI>Miracle</HI>, than what we with the greate&s;t &s;urprize &s;hould &s;o &s;tile, its remaining pendulous in the open Air; &s;ince the former requires an <HI>active Influence</HI> in the Cau&s;e, while the latter &s;uppo&s;es <HI>Non-annihilation</HI> only. But be&s;ides this, tho' we were able exactly to di&s;tingui&s;h in general the ordinary Concurrence of God from his extraordinary, yet would the Task before us be &s;till &s;ufficiently difficult. For tho&s;e Events or Actions are in holy Scripture attributed immediately to the Power and Provi|dence of God, which yet were to all outward appearance according to the con&s;tant cour&s;e of things; and would, ab&s;tractedly from &s;uch Affirmations of the Holy Books, have been e&s;teem'd no more miraculous than the other common Effects of Nature, or u&s;ual Accidents

of Human Affairs; as tho&s;e who have carefully con&s;ider'd the&s;e matters, e&s;pecially the Hi&s;torical and Prophetical Parts of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI>, mu&s;t be oblig'd to confe&s;s. Neither is it unrea&s;onable that all things &s;hould in that manner be a&s;crib'd to the &s;upreme Being on &s;everal accounts. 'Tis from him every thing is ultimately deriv'd: He pre&s;erves the Natures, and continues the Powers of every Creature: He not only at fir&s;t produc'd, but perpetually di&s;po&s;es and makes u&s;e of the whole Creation, and every part thereof, as the In&s;tru|ments of his Providence: He fore&s;aw and fore|adapted the entire Frame: He determin'd his Co-operation or Permi&s;&s;ion to every Action: He &s;o order'd and appointed the whole Sy&s;tem, with every individual Branch of it, as to Time, Place, Proportion, and all other Circum&s;tances, that nothing &s;hould happen un&s;ea&s;onably, unfitly, di&s;proportionately, or otherwi&s;e than the Jun|ctures of Affairs, the demerits of his rea&s;o|nable Creatures, and the wi&s;e Intentions of his Providence did require. In fine, he &s;o previ|ou&s;ly adju&s;ted and contemper'd the Moral and Natural World to one another, that the Marks and Tokens of his Providence &s;hould be in all Ages legible and con&s;picuous, what&s;oever the vi&s;ible &s;econdary Cau&s;es or Occa&s;ions might be. Seeing then this is the true State of the Ca&s;e; and that con&s;equently, Almighty God has &s;o con&s;tituted the World, that no Body can tell wherein it differs from one, where all were &s;olely brought to pa&s;s by a miraculous Power; 'tis by no means untrue or improper in the Holy Books to refer all tho&s;e things which bare Human Authors would derive from &s;econd Cau&s;es, the con&s;tant Cour&s;e of Nature, and the Circum&s;tances of Human Affairs, to
<PB N="295" REF="401">
the fir&s;t Cau&s;e, the ultimate Spring and Original of all; and to call Mens Thoughts (which are too apt to terminate there) from the apparent Occa&s;ions, to the invi&s;ible God, the Creator, Go|vernor, and Di&s;po&s;er of the whole, and the &s;ole Object of their Regard and Adoration. This is, I &s;ay, a very proper and rea&s;onable Procedure; this is u&s;ually ob&s;erv'd by the &s;acred Penmen, (who are thereby peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;h'd from prophane Authors) and this is of the highe&s;t Advantage in Morality. But then it mu&s;t be withal acknowledg'd, that this creates great Dif|ficulties in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and makes it very hard in a Philo&s;ophick Attempt of this nature, to di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e parts of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation, which are <HI>Mechanically</HI> to be account|ed for, and tho&s;e in which the miraculous <HI>Energy</HI> of God Almighty interpos'd it &s;elf; which yet, if ever, is certainly to be allow'd in this ca&s;e, where a new World was to be form'd, and a wild <HI>Chaos</HI> reduc'd into a regular, beautiful, and permanent Sy&s;tem. This being &s;aid in general, to be&s;peak the <HI>Reader</HI>'s Candor in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, and to forewarn him not to fear the mo&s;t Mechanical and Philo&s;ophick Account of this Creation, as if thereby the Holy Scriptures wrre &s;uper&s;eded, or the Divine Power and Pro|vidence excluded; I come directly to the Point before us, and &s;hall endeavour to determine what are the In&s;tances of the extraordinary Power and Interpo&s;ition of God in this whole Affair. That as we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee how Or|derly, Methodical, and Regular this Formation was, &s;o we may before-hand be duly &s;en&s;ible how Supernatural, Providential, and <HI>Divine</HI> it was al&s;o; and &s;o as well, like <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>, contem|plate and adore the Omnipotent Creator in his

<HI>Miraculous</HI>, as we, like <HI>Philo&s;ophers</HI>, &s;hall attempt to con&s;ider and remark his Vicegerent Nature in her <HI>Mechanical</HI> Operations therein. For, not|with&s;tanding what has been above in&s;i&s;ted on touching the frequency and propriety of a&s;cribing the Effects of Nature to the Divine Power; (the former being indeed nothing, but the latter acting according to fix'd and certain Laws;) yet, becau&s;e more has been commonly, and may ju&s;tly be &s;uppos'd the importance of the Texts of Scrip|ture hereto relating; becau&s;e the Finger of God, or his &s;upernatural Efficiency, is, if ever, to be rea&s;onably expected in the Origin of things, and that in a peculiar and remarkable manner; becau&s;e &s;ome things done in this Creation are beyond the Power of Philo&s;ophy and Mechani&s;m, and no otherwi&s;e accountable but by the infinite Power of God him&s;elf; becau&s;e the Days of Creation are &s;ignally di&s;tingui&s;h'd from tho&s;e following, in which God is &s;aid to have <HI>re&s;ted</HI>; (when yet his ordinary Concurrence with the Cour&s;e of Nature was continu'd without Interruption;) and mu&s;t therefore be reckon'd &s;uch, on which he truly exerted a Power different from the other: On all the&s;e accounts, I freely, and in earne&s;t allow and believe, that there was a peculiar Power, and extraordinary Providence exercis'd by the great Creator of all, in this Primitive Origin of the Sublunary World, or Formation of the Earth, which we are a going to account for. The par|ticular In&s;tances I &s;hall give of the &s;ame, without pre&s;uming to exclude all others, are the&s;e follow|ing.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Creation of the Matter of the Univer&s;e, and particularly of that of the Earth, out of no|thing, was, without doubt, originally, the alone

The pro|duction of a real Being out of nothing; or, to &s;peak more properly, the primary bringing any real thing into Being, is in the Opinion of all Men, the Effect of no le&s;s than an infinite and Omnipotent Deity.

<P>And here it will be fit to con&s;ider an Objection made again&s;t the pre&s;ent <HI>Hypothe&s;is, viz.</HI> That if we proceed mechanically and gradually in the formation of the Earth, from a Comet's Atmo|&s;phere, we mu&s;t allow the whole &s;ub&s;idence to be as lei&s;urely, and to proceed by the &s;ame Steps that the Violence of its heat decrea&s;es; which will then be compleated not in <HI>&s;ix Days</HI> or <HI>&s;ingle Years</HI>, but &s;carcely in as many <HI>Centuries</HI>. But in an&s;wer to this, I deny that all the Confu&s;ions of a Comet's Atmo&s;phere are owing to the Heat at the <HI>Perihelion</HI>; and I al&s;o affirm, that &s;ince A&s;tronomers find by Ob&s;ervation, that upon a Comet's return to the Solar Regions towards its <HI>Perihelion</HI>, its Atmo|&s;phere does &s;till return therewith, and is not at all &s;ettled and formed like a Planet, I mu&s;t con|tradict that Ob&s;ervation, if I &s;hould a&s;cribe the formation of our Earth to &s;uch a gradual and tedious Operation. In my Opinion all the &s;ame Laws, Properties, and Operations of Bodies which we find e&s;tabli&s;h'd here on Earth, do not
<PB N="303" REF="409">
&s;o univer&s;ally obtain in the Atmo&s;pheres of Co|mets: But &s;everal new ones were, I &s;uppo&s;e, in|troduc'd at the <HI>Mo&s;aik</HI> Creation; &s;uch I mean (be&s;ides the Law of Gravity, and the general and mechanical Laws of Motion, which I look upon as univer&s;al, and &s;ome of them unalterable,) as were fit or nece&s;&s;ary for the primary formation and continuance of that New World, which God's Providence was then introducing. I do not there|fore &s;ay with &s;ome, That the Earth was not form'd according to the known Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI>, but by the Efficacy of the Divine Spirit which moved on the face of the Waters: But denying the Oppo&s;ition, I affirm, that the Earth was form'd according to the known Laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI>, &s;ome of them introduc'd then by the Efficacy of the Divine Spirit which moved on the Face of the Waters, and ever &s;ince continued among us. For, for the Almighty to introduce new and regular Laws at the Beginning of a new World which are to be ever after ob&s;erv'd in it, I take to be a Miraculous Interpo&s;ition very worthy of God, and very accountable to the Rea&s;on of Mankind. And to &s;ome of the&s;e Laws duly tim'd and proportion'd, I refer the exactne&s;s of the pre&s;ent Ob&s;ervations; <HI>viz.</HI> That all things &s;hould in ju&s;t 6 Days or Years time be fini&s;h'd and com|pleated, in the manner we have'em mention'd in the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory. And truly every thing here does &s;o &s;uit together, that the plain Foot&s;teps of particular Art and Contrivance are vi&s;ible in the whole Conduct and Management of this Matter: Which therefore is not to be deriv'd from meer Mechanical Laws of Brute Matter, but from a Supernatural and Divine Provi|dence.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) But principally, The Creation of our fir&s;t
<PB N="304" REF="410">
Parents is to be e&s;teem'd the peculiar Operation of the Almighty; and that whether we regard the Formation of their Bodies, or the Forepa&s;t Creation and After-Infu&s;ion of their Souls. 'Tis evident from the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory of the Creation, that our fir&s;t Parents were on the very &s;ame Day in which they were made, in a State of Maturi|ty and Perfection, and capable of all Human Actions, both of Mind and Body. Now if they, like the other Animals, had been pro|duc'd in the u&s;ual Time and proce&s;s of Gene|ration, and come to ripene&s;s of Age and Facul|ties by degrees afterwards; That were plainly impo&s;&s;ible. This Creation therefore mu&s;t have been peculiar, and the immediate Effect of a Divine Power. And this is no le&s;s agreeable to Philo&s;ophy, than &s;uitable to the Dignity of the Subject, and for the Honour of Mankind. It has been already ob&s;erv'd that the Seeds of Plants and Animals mu&s;t be allow'd to have been all the immediate Workman&s;hip of God; and that they contain every individual Part or Member of the entire Bodies, <HI>in parvo</HI>; and that by con&s;equence Generation is nothing el&s;e but Nutrition or Argumentation. Since therefore God by his immediate Power, created the entire Bo|dies of all Plants and Animals, 'tis by no means hard to conceive that he might create them in what Degree of Maturity and Perfection he pleas'd, without any manner of Infringement of the Order of Nature then to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd: And if we have rea&s;on to believe, that the Bodies of brute Creatures were created <HI>in parvo</HI>, in a &s;mall State, &s;uch as we now call Seeds, and &s;o requir'd a proper Generation, <HI>i.e.</HI> Nutrition and Augmen|tation of Parts; (as the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory plainly de&s;cribes them; and had it not done &s;o, we
<PB N="305" REF="411">
could not with any Certainty have a&s;&s;erted it;) We have &s;ure equal Rea&s;on to believe, from the De&s;cription of the &s;ame Author in this other ca&s;e, that the Bodies of our fir&s;t Parents were Origi|nally created in their Mature Bulk, and State of Manhood; &s;o as immediately to be capable of the &s;ame Operations which at any time afterward they might be thought to be. This miraculous Origi|nation of the Bodies of our fir&s;t Parents is there|fore very rationally a&s;cribed to the Finger of God by <HI>Mo&s;es:</HI> And we may ju&s;tly believe that eve|ry Per&s;on in the Ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, as 'tis repre|&s;ented in the Sacred Hi&s;tory, was peculiarly con|cern'd in the Production of that Being which was to bear the Image of God, and be made ca|pable of &s;ome degree of his Immortality. And then as to the Soul of Man, 'tis certainly a very di&s;tinct Being from, and one very much advanced above the Body; and therefore if we were forc'd to introduce a Divine Power in the Formation of the latter, we can do no le&s;s than that in the Crea|tion and Infu&s;ion of the former. And indeed the Dignity and Faculties of the Human Soul are &s;o va&s;tly exalted above all the Material, or merely Animal Creation, that its Original mu&s;t be de|riv'd from the immediate Finger of God, in a manner &s;till more peculiar and divine than all the re&s;t. That nearer re&s;emblance of the Spiritual Nature, Immortal Condition, Active Powers, and Free, Rational, and Moral Operations of the Divine Being it &s;elf, which the Souls of Men were to bear about them, did but require &s;ome peculiar and extraordinary Conduct in their fir&s;t Exi&s;tence, after-Union with Matter, and Intro|duction into the corporeal World. Agreeably whereto we may ea&s;ily ob&s;erve a &s;ignal Di&s;tincti|on in the Sacred Hi&s;tory between the formation
<PB N="306" REF="412">
of all the other Animals, and the Creation of Man. In the former Ca&s;e 'tis only &s;aid, <HI>Let the Waters bring forth the moving Creature that hath Life.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i.20.</NOTE> <HI>Let the Earth bring forth the living Creature after his Kind</HI>. But of the latter the entire Trinity con|&s;ult:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver&s;e 24.</NOTE> <HI>And God &s;aid, Let Us make man in our I|mage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver&s;e 26. Chap. ii.7.</NOTE> after our Likene&s;s. And the Lord God form|ed man of the du&s;t of the ground, and breathed into his no&s;trils the breath of life, and man became a living &s;oul.</HI> As therefore the &s;everal parts of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation before-mention'd are not to be mecha|nically attempted, but look'd upon as the Effects of the Extraordinary and Miraculous Power and Providence of God, &s;o more e&s;pecially the For|mation of the Body of Man in its mature State, and mo&s;t of all the primary Creation and after-Infu&s;ion of the Rational Human Soul, is to be wholly a&s;crib'd to the &s;ame wonderful Interpo&s;i|tion and Efficiency of the Supreme Being, the Creator of all things, <HI>God ble&s;&s;ed for evermore</HI>. All which taken together and duly con&s;ider'd, is, I think, a &s;ufficient and &s;atisfactory Account of the Propo&s;ition before us, and attributes as much to the Miraculous and immediate Hand of God, as either Tradition, Rea&s;on, or Scripture, require in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.</P>

one, the Commencing of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation, and the Influence of the Divine Spirit, all things would begin to take their own Places, and each <HI>Species</HI> of Bodies rank them&s;elves into that order, which, according to the Law of Specifick Gra|vity, were due to them. By which method the Ma&s;s of den&s;e Fluids, which compos'd one part of the entire <HI>Chaos</HI>, being heavier than the Ma&s;&s;es of Earth, and Water, and Air, would &s;ink down|wards with the greate&s;t Force and Velocity, and elevate tho&s;e Ma&s;&s;es inclo&s;ed among them upwards. Which procedure mu&s;t therefore di&s;tingui&s;h the Chaos or Atmo&s;phere into two very different and di&s;tinct Regions: The lower and larger whereof would be a Collection, or Sy&s;tem of den&s;e and heavy Fluids, or a va&s;t Aby&s;s immediately en|compa&s;&s;ing the central &s;olid Body: The higher and le&s;&s;er would be a Collection, or Sy&s;tem of earthy, watery, and aery Parts, confu&s;edly mix'd together, and encompa&s;&s;ing the &s;aid Aby&s;s, in the &s;ame manner as that did the central Solid. And this I take to be the State of Darkne&s;s, which the Propo&s;ition we are upon mentions: And that the <HI>Chaos</HI>, particularly the Face or up|per Regions of it, were at this time in &s;uch a dark and caliginous Condition, will ea&s;ily ap|pear. For all tho&s;e Opake or Earthy Corpu&s;cles which before rov'd about the immen&s;e Regions of the Atmo&s;phere, and frequently even then ob&s;cur'd the Central Solid to any external Spe|ctator, were now crowded nearer together; and in&s;tead of flying up and down in, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a prodigious Orb or Expan&s;um, were reduc'd to a narrow Sphere, and confin'd within a &s;pace not perhaps in Diameter the hundredth Part of the former; and mu&s;t by con&s;e|quence exclude the Rays of the Sun in another-gue&s;s

In the &s;ame manner 'tis ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e Opake and Earthy Ma&s;&s;es, which in tho&s;e va&s;ter Regions would but in a le&s;s degree, and in &s;ome places, exclude the Beams of the Sun, mu&s;t, when collected and crowded clo&s;er together on the Surface of the A|by&s;s, exclude them in a degree va&s;tly &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the former; mu&s;t occa&s;ion an entire Darkne&s;s in all its Regions, and particularly in tho&s;e upper ones, over which they were immediately collect|ed. And if from the former compari&s;on we e&s;ti|mate how few Vapours collected into a Cloud with us will cau&s;e no incon&s;iderable degree of Darkne&s;s; and allow, as is but rea&s;onable, a pro|portionably greater degree of Darkne&s;s to a pro|portionably greater number of Earthy and O|pake Corpu&s;cles crowded together; we &s;hall not doubt but all manner of Communication with the heavenly Bodies, and the external World, mu&s;t be entirely interrupted; and the lea&s;t ima|ginable Ray or Beam of Light from the Sun ex|cluded, not only from the lowe&s;t but even all, excepting the very highe&s;t Regions of this <HI>&s;upe|rior Chaos</HI>.

<Q>V. The vi&s;ible Part of the Fir&s;t Day's Work was the Production of Light, or its &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Appearance to all the Parts of the Earth; with the con&s;equent Di&s;tinction of Darkne&s;s and Light, Night and Day upon the Face of it.</Q>
<P N="5">V. If we remember in what State we left the <HI>Chaos</HI> in the la&s;t Propo&s;ition, and &s;uffer our Thoughts to run naturally along with its &s;ucceed|ing Mutations, we &s;hall find that the next thing to be here con&s;ider'd, (for the Subterraneous Sy&s;tem of den&s;e Fluids, or the great Aby&s;s, not coming directly within the De&s;ign of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>, is not here to be particularly pro&s;ecuted any far|ther) is the Separation of this Upper and <HI>Ele|mentary
<PB N="312" REF="418">
Chaos</HI>, or <HI>Congeries</HI> of Earthy, Watery and Aery Corpu&s;cles, into two &s;omewhat diffe|rent Regions; the one a &s;olid Orb of Earth, with con&s;iderable quantities of Water in its Pores; the other an <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> in a peculiar Sen&s;e, or Ma&s;s of the lighte&s;t Earthy, with the re&s;t of the Watery and the Aery Particles, &s;till &s;omewhat confu&s;edly mix'd together. For &s;ince this Upper <HI>Chaos</HI>, (tho' in general much lighter than the <HI>Aby&s;s</HI> beneath) con&s;i&s;ted of Parts very Heterogeneous, and of different &s;pecifick Gravi|ties (the Earthy being heavier than the Watery, and tho&s;e yet heavier than the Aery Particles;) 'tis evident, that in the &s;ame manner as this whole mixed Ma&s;s was &s;eparated from the heavier <HI>Aby&s;s</HI> beneath, mu&s;t it again &s;eparate and divide it &s;elf into two &s;uch general Orbs as were ju&s;t now men|tion'd. The former con&s;i&s;ting of the den&s;er and &s;olider Parts, &s;uch as the Earthy, Claiy, Sandy, Gravelly, Stony <HI>Strata</HI> of the pre&s;ent Earth, with &s;o many of the Watery Particles as either being already in tho&s;e Regions mu&s;t be enclo&s;ed therein, or could de&s;cend from above, and have Admittance into the Pores thereof: The <HI>latter</HI> of the le&s;s Solid, and lighter Earthy; with the re&s;t of the Watery, and the Aery Particles, not yet &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h'd from each other. This Proce&s;s will I &s;uppo&s;e ea&s;ily be allow'd, except|ing what relates to the enclo&s;ing of many of the Watery Parts within the Earth; with relation to which, 'tis commonly &s;uppos'd that becau&s;e Wa|ter is &s;pecifically lighter than Earth, it mu&s;t in the regular Dige&s;tions of a <HI>Chaos</HI>, take the Upper Situation, and cover that highe&s;t Orb, as that would others of greater Gravity than it &s;elf. 'Tis al&s;o commonly imagin'd that the <HI>Mo&s;aick Co&s;mo|gony</HI> favours &s;uch an <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, and &s;uppo&s;es the
<PB N="313" REF="419">
Waters to have encompa&s;s'd the Globe, and co|ver'd its Surface, till on the third Day they were deriv'd into the Seas. Now, as I by no means apprehend any nece&s;&s;ity of under&s;tanding the <HI>Mo|&s;aick</HI> Creation in this Sen&s;e; &s;o I am pretty &s;ure 'tis contrary to a Philo&s;ophical Account of the Formation of the Chaos; unle&s;s one of the&s;e two things were certain, Either that the Quantity of Water were &s;o much greater than that of the Earth, that all the Pores and Inter&s;tices of the latter could not contain it; or el&s;e that it was generally elevated into the Air in the form of Vapour, and &s;u&s;tain'd there while the Earth &s;et|tled and con&s;olidated together, and did not till then de&s;cend and take its own proper place. The <HI>former</HI> of which is neither reconcilable to the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation, nor will be a&s;&s;erted by any who knows, even &s;ince the Deluge, how &s;mall the Quantity of Fluids in Compari&s;on to that of the Solids is in the Earth on which we live. And the <HI>latter</HI> is too much to be granted in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e by any con&s;idering Per&s;on, who knows that a Comet's Vapours con&s;titute the main part of that Tail or Mi&s;t, which is &s;ometimes equal to a Cylinder, who&s;e Ba&s;is is 100,000 Miles in Dia|meter, and its Altitude as far as from the Sun to the Earth, or about 81,000,000 Miles; (as it was in the la&s;t famous Comet in 1681, repre&s;ented in Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s own Scheme;) Let the rarity of the &s;ame be &s;uppos'd as great as any <HI>Phaeno|mena</HI> &s;hall require. For to clear this matter by a familiar In&s;tance or Experiment; Take Sand or Du&s;t, and let them fall gently into a Ve&s;&s;el, till it be near full: Take afterwards &s;ome Water, and pour it alike gently into the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el: And it will &s;oon appear, that, notwith&s;tanding the greater &s;pecifick Gravity of the dry and
<PB N="314" REF="420">
Earthy, than of the Moi&s;t and Watery Parts, (whence one might imagine that the Sand or Du&s;t would be the lowe&s;t, and the Water &s;wim uppermo&s;t on the Surface of the other, without mingling therewith,) yet will the latter imme|diately &s;ink downwards, and &s;o throughly drench and &s;atiate the &s;aid Ma&s;s before any will remain on the Top, that its proportion to that of the Solid Parts will be very con&s;iderable. Which be|ing apply'd to the Point before us, will take a|way all imaginable Difficulty in the Ca&s;e: It be|ing evident, without this Compari&s;on, that &s;uch Watery Particles as were already intermix'd with the others would remain where they were; and with this, equally &s;o, that many of the re&s;t, which were above the &s;ame, upon the fir&s;t &s;ub&s;idence of the Earthy <HI>Strata</HI> would penetrate, pervade and &s;aturate the &s;ame. So that on this fir&s;t <HI>Day</HI> or <HI>Year</HI> of the Creation, the Earthy and Den&s;er Parts would take their places lowe&s;t, on the Sur|face of the great Aby&s;s; would &s;ettle in part in|to the &s;ame, and compo&s;e an Orb of Earth; and in its Inter&s;tices and little Cavities all &s;uch wa|tery Particles as were already in this Region, or de&s;cended upon it before its con&s;olidation, would be enclos'd; and that as far above the Surface of the Aby&s;s, to which they would be contiguous, as their Quantity could enable them to reach. On this fir&s;t Day or Year al&s;o the upper Regions of the <HI>Chaos</HI>, being now in &s;ome mea&s;ure freed from tho&s;e Earthy and Opake Ma&s;&s;es which be|fore excluded the &s;ame, and cau&s;ed the before-mention'd thick Darkne&s;s; would in &s;ome de|gree admit the Rays of the Sun. Now therefore that glorious Emanation, <HI>Light</HI>, the vi&s;ible Part of this Day's Work, would begin to appear on the Face of the Earth: Now would it, by the
<PB N="513" REF="421">
Annual Motion, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively illuminate the &s;eve|ral Parts of it: And now would it con&s;equently cau&s;e that natural Di&s;tinction between Darkne&s;s and Light, Night and Day&punc; round the whole Globe, which was to be accounted for in this Propo&s;ition. Which progre&s;s of the <HI>Chaos</HI>, and &s;tate of Nature is well enough exhibited by the <HI>Theori&s;t</HI>'s third Figure;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theor. p. 38.</NOTE> which therefore is here delineated.</P>

<P><PB N="316" REF="422">Corollary. <HI>Hence we may ob&s;erve the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the</HI> Mo&s;aick <HI>Creation, and how fitly it begins at the Production of Light; without taking notice of &s;uch</HI> prior <HI>Conditions, and &s;uch Preparations of the</HI> Cha|os <HI>which have been before explain'd, and were in or|der of Nature previous to this Day's Work. For this account reaching only to the vi&s;ible World, and the vi|&s;ible Effects in it; and keeping &s;till within the bounds of Sen&s;e, and of common Ob&s;ervation, could not bet|ter be accommodated to the truth of things, and the Ca|pacities of all, than by &s;uch a procedure. The Anci|ent condition of the</HI> Chaos <HI>in former Ages was no way here concern'd, and &s;o was entirely to be omitted. The State of Darkne&s;s which immediately preceded the &s;ix Days Work, and which, with relation thereto, was nece&s;&s;ary to be mention'd, made a very proper introduction, and &s;o very fitly was to be hinted at by way of Preface thereto. Both which Ca&s;es are ac|cordingly by</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>taken care of. And &s;o the fir&s;t Period was the Production of Light, the Admi&s;&s;ion of the Rays of the Sun, and the Origin of Day and Night depending thereon; as the Method and</HI> Deco|rum <HI>of things, with the Apprehen&s;ions of the People, did</HI> both <HI>very naturally require. For &s;ince in this Sacred Hi&s;tory of the Origin of things, not only the</HI> Vi&s;ible <HI>World, and the</HI> Vi&s;ible <HI>Parts of it were &s;in|gly concern'd; But principally the Effects to be enume|rated were &s;uch as requir'd the Light and Heat of the Sun, the one to be</HI> View'd, <HI>the other to be</HI> Pro|duc'd <HI>by; and without the latter could no more have</HI> Been <HI>at all, than been</HI> Con&s;picuous <HI>without the for|mer; 'Twas very &s;uitable, and very natural in the fir&s;t place to introduce the Cau&s;e or In&s;trument, and afterwards in the &s;ucceeding Periods, to recount the Effects thereof in the World: Fir&s;t to acquaint us that the Light and Heat of the Sun were in &s;ome mea|&s;ure admitted into the upper Regions of the</HI> Chaos,

<HI>and then to relate tho&s;e remarkable Con&s;equences there|of which the &s;ucceeding Periods of the Creation ex|hibited on the face of the Earth.

<Q>VI. The vi&s;ible part of the Second Day's Work was the elevation of the Air, with all its contain'd Va|pours; the &s;preading it for an <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> above the Earth; and the Di&s;tinction thence ari&s;ing of <HI>Superior</HI> and <HI>Inferior</HI> Waters; the former con&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e Vapours, rais'd and &s;u&s;tain'd by the Air; the latter, of &s;uch as either were enclo&s;ed in the Pores, Inter|&s;tices and Bowels of the Earth, or lay upon the Sur|face thereof.</Q>
<P N="6">VI. When at the Conclu&s;ion of the former Day the Heat of the Sun began con&s;iderably to penetrate the <HI>Superior</HI> Regions of the <HI>Chaos</HI>, and the two different Orbs, the Solider Earthy, and the Fluider Aery Ma&s;&s;es, began to be pretty well di&s;tingui&s;h'd, the &s;ame things would pro|ceed &s;till on this &s;ucceeding Day. The Lower Earthy <HI>Strata</HI> would be &s;ettling &s;omewhat clo&s;er together; the Watery Parts would &s;ub&s;ide, and where they could get Entrance, would &s;aturate their inward Pores and Vacuities, and the <HI>At|mo&s;phere</HI> would free it &s;elf more and more from the heavie&s;t and mo&s;t opake Corpu&s;cles, and thereby become in a greater degree tenuious, pure, and clear than before. Whereupon, by that time the Night, or fir&s;t Part of this Second <HI>Day</HI> or <HI>Year</HI> was over and the Sun aro&s;e, the Light and Heat of that Luminary, would more freely and deeply penetrate the Atmo&s;phere, and become very &s;en&s;ible in the&s;e Upper or Aery Regions; which being &s;uppos'd, the proper Effects which were to be next expected, mu&s;t be, that va&s;t Quantities of Vapours would be ele|vated into, and there &s;u&s;tain'd by the now better
<PB N="318" REF="424">
purify'd Air, and &s;o increa&s;e the va&s;t Quantities which were already there; while in the mean time all the Earthy Corpu&s;cles which were un|capable of Rarefaction, and with them all &s;uch Watery Particles as were &s;o near the Earth that the Sun's Power could not &s;ufficiently reach 'em, were &s;till &s;inking downwards, and the former increa&s;ing the Cra&s;&s;itude and Bulk of the Solid Earth; and the latter, if the Earth was too &s;olid to admit them, as by this time it would proba|bly be, flowing down apace, and covering all its Surface with Water. From all which, 'tis ea&s;y to account for the Particulars of this Day's Work. The <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> or Firmament which was this Day &s;pread out above the Earth, was plainly the <HI>Air</HI>, now truly &s;o called, as being freed from mo&s;t of its Earthy Mixtures. The <HI>Superior-Waters</HI>, all tho&s;e fre&s;h ones, which in the Form of Vapour, a nine or ten Months Heat of the Sun, with the continual A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Cen|tral Heat, could elevate, and the Air &s;u&s;tain, be|&s;ides tho&s;e va&s;t Quantities of Salt ones, which had never yet left tho&s;e Regions. The <HI>Inferior Waters</HI> were tho&s;e which were not elevated, but remain'd below, all that fell down with, were enclos'd in, &s;unk into, or lay upon the Orb of the Earth beneath. And when it is particularly &s;aid by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> that 'twas this <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> or Firmament which was to divide the <HI>Superior</HI> from the <HI>Inferior</HI> Waters, that is ex|actly agreeable to the Nature of Things, and &s;uita|ble to this Account: It being the <HI>Air</HI> which truly and properly &s;u&s;tain'd all tho&s;e Vapours, as now it does the Clouds, above the Earth; and was thereby the Means of &s;eparating them from their Fellows in the Bowels, or on the Surface thereof. Neither has that Objection any weight in it, that the Waters in the Seas are call'd by <HI>Mo&s;es, Waters
<PB N="319" REF="425">
under the Firmament</HI>, and &s;o mu&s;t be of a different nature and original from tho&s;e in the Air, which are <HI>Waters above the Firmament</HI>; whereas I derive the one from the other, and &s;uppo&s;e the Seas to have once been Vapour, and &s;o part of the other Waters. For, certainly, if Vapours in the Air, or <HI>Waters above the Firmament</HI> fall down, become properly <HI>Water</HI>, and run down into the Seas, they mu&s;t be allow'd to change their Name, and become <HI>Waters below the Firmament</HI>: I am &s;ure this Change is no new thing, but has been continual from the Creation till our times. Every Day Vapours become Rain, and run into Seas; and the Seas are every Day re&s;olving into &s;mall Parts, and become Vapours; and &s;o the <HI>inferior</HI> and <HI>&s;uperior</HI> Waters &s;till communicate with and &s;upply each other, and accordingly change their Denomination perpetually: Which State of the <HI>Chaos</HI>, or Progre&s;s of the Creation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theor. p. 39.</NOTE> is well re|pre&s;ented in the <HI>Theori&s;t</HI>'s Fourth Figure; which here follows.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="426"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Corollary 1. <HI>Hence appears a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on why in this Six Day's Creation one entire Day is al|low'd to the Formation of the Air, and the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing the Waters in the &s;ame, from tho&s;e beneath; which has hitherto &s;eem'd &s;omewhat &s;trange and di&s;|proportionate. 'Tis certain this Work requir'd as long a time, and was of as great importance as any other what&s;oever: A great part of that Water which the Earth was to have in its Air, or upon its Surface, till the Deluge, being, 'tis probable, entirely owing to this Day's Elevation of it. For had it not been thus buoy'd up and &s;u&s;tain'd on high, it mu&s;t have &s;unk down|ward,
<PB N="321" REF="427">
and &s;o perhaps have been inclo&s;ed in the Bowels of the Earth, without po&s;&s;ibility of Redemption; and have rendred the</HI> Antediluvian <HI>World more like to a dry and barren</HI> Wilderne&s;s, <HI>than, what it was to exceed, a juicy, fruitful and habitable</HI> Canaan.</P>
<P>Coroll. 2. <HI>Hence ari&s;es a new Confirmation that the</HI> Days <HI>of the Creation were</HI> Years <HI>al&s;o. For &s;ee|ing the quantity of Water which was pre&s;erv'd above Ground, and fill'd all the Seas before the Deluge, was in great part the &s;ame which was this &s;econd</HI> Day <HI>elevated into Vapour; had this</HI> Day <HI>been no longer than one of ours at pre&s;ent, the foremention'd quantity would have been too little to &s;aturate the Earth, &s;up|ply the Rivers, and fill all the Seas, and about an half of it every Day would be wholly exhal'd af|terwards, and &s;uffer the Vegetable and Animal Kingdoms to faint and wither, if not to peri&s;h for want of Moi&s;ture. All which, in the</HI> Hypothe&s;is <HI>we here take, is wholly avoided, and a very fit and &s;uitable proportion of Waters pre&s;erv'd above for all the nece&s;&s;ities of the Earth, with its Productions and Inhabitants.</HI></P>
<Q>VII. The vi&s;ible Parts of the Third Day's Work were two, the former the Collection of the <HI>inferior</HI> Wa|ters, or &s;uch as were now under the Heaven, into the Seas, with the con&s;equent Appearance of the dry Land; the latter the Production of Vegetables out of that Ground &s;o lately become dry.</Q>
<P N="7">VII. In order to the apprehending of the <HI>double</HI> operation of this Day, we mu&s;t call to mind what &s;tate the Orb of Earth was in by this time. We have &s;een already that it had been &s;ettling together, and fixing it &s;elf on the Surface of the Aby&s;s from the very beginning of the Creation; and we ought to &s;uppo&s;e that in the &s;pace of two Years it was not only become wholly di&s;tinct from the Aby&s;s below, and the Atmo|&s;phere above it, but that it was &s;ettled and con|&s;olidated
<PB N="322" REF="428">
together, and its <HI>Strata</HI> grown firm and compacted. Nay that it was by the cohe|&s;ion of its Parts, grown &s;olid &s;ome time before all the lighter and remoter Earthly Parts were de|&s;cended upon it, as &s;uppo&s;e by the end of the fir&s;t Day. We mu&s;t farther ob&s;erve, that by rea&s;on of its Columns different Den&s;ity, and Specifick Gravity, (atte&s;ted to, <HI>&agrave; priori</HI> from the <HI>Chaos</HI>'s, and <HI>&agrave; po&s;teriori</HI> from the internal Earth's <HI>Phae|nomena</HI>,) it was &s;ettled into the Aby&s;s in diffe|rent degrees, and thereby became of an unequal Surface di&s;tingui&s;h'd into Mountains, Plains and Vallies. I &s;ay it was <HI>&s;ettled into the Aby&s;s in different degrees</HI>, but yet not near to &s;uch a degree as the law of Specifick Gravity requir'd, as nece&s;&s;arily follows from what was now &s;aid, that the &s;everal Columns would be con&s;olida|ted together the fir&s;t Day, before all the lighter and remoter Earthly Parts which were to com|po&s;e it were de&s;cended upon it on the Second, and perhaps afterwards al&s;o on part of the Third.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vid.</HI> Lem. 81. cum Coroll. &amp; Hypoth. 2. prius.</NOTE> Which things being &s;uppos'd and con&s;ider'd, the two Works of this Day or Year of the Crea|tion, which are of them&s;elves very different, will be ea&s;ily under&s;tood and reconcil'd. For when at Sun-&s;et, or the Conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t Day, we left the Air by the nine or ten Months Power of the Sun elevating fre&s;h ones, and by the great quantity of &s;alt ones &s;till remaining there from the beginning, crowded with Vapours to a prodigious degree; upon the coming on of this Third Day, and in its Night or former part, the &s;aid va&s;t Quantities of Vapours mu&s;t needs de|&s;cend, and &s;o by degrees mu&s;t leave the Air pretty free, and take their places on the Surface of the Earth; altering thereby their own deno|mination, and becoming of <HI>Upper</HI> or <HI>Cele&s;tial,
<PB N="323" REF="429">
Lower</HI> or <HI>Terre&s;trial</HI> Waters. Indeed if we do but allow the effect to be in any mea&s;ure an&s;wer|able to the Time, we &s;hall grant that in the two or three Months of Night, which is the former part of this Third Period of the Creation, the main Body of the Vapours mu&s;t have not only de&s;cended down upon the Earth, but, by rea&s;on of the inequality of its Surface, and the Solidity withal, have run down from the higher and more extant Parts, by the Declivites and Hollows, into the lowe&s;t Vallies, and mo&s;t depre&s;&s;ed Re|gions of all; mu&s;t in the&s;e places have compos'd the Seas and Lakes every where throughout the Surface of the Earth; and &s;o by that time the Light appear'd, and the Sun's ri&s;ing began the latter part of this Day, the entire face of the Globe, which was ju&s;t before cover'd as it were with the de&s;cending Waters, mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;h'd into over-flow'd Vallies, and extant Continents, into Seas and dry Lands, that very Work of this Day we were in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place to enquire about. <HI>The Waters under the heavens were</HI> now <HI>gathered to|gether into</HI> their re&s;pective and di&s;tinct <HI>places, and the dry land appear'd</HI> and became fit for the Pro|duction of the Vegetable Kingdom. Which therefore mo&s;t naturally leads us to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Branch of this Day's Work: For when thus far was compleated on the Night or former part of this Day; (which the Ab&s;ence of the Sun &s;o long together rendred peculiarly and &s;olely fit to per|mit and procure the de&s;cent of Vapours;) and when at the &s;ame time the dry Land was now di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Seas, and ju&s;t become (in the utmo&s;t degree) moi&s;t and juicy; upon the Sun-Ri&s;ing or coming on of the Day-time, 'twas of all other the mo&s;t fit and convenient Sea&s;on for the Germination of the Seeds of Vegeta|bles
<PB N="324" REF="430">
and the growth of Trees, Shrubs, Plants and Herbs out of the Earth. The Soil, &s;atur'd and fatned by the foregoing half Year's de&s;cent of Vapours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theor. l. 1. p. 42. &amp; l. 2. c. 7.</NOTE> was now like the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, that fruitful Se|minary of the Vegetable and Animal Producti|ons of Primitive Nature, &s;o much celebrated by all Antiquity. Nine or Ten Months of the Sun's pre&s;ence together, was a time as proper and as natural for &s;uch a purpo&s;e as could po&s;&s;ibly be de&s;ir'd. And when there was this Nine or Ten Months Day to &s;pare in this Period of the Crea|tion, after one Work was compleated; and the &s;ame was &s;o very fitly prepar'd and di&s;pos'd for the Production of Vegetables; 'tis no wonder that this above all the other Divi&s;ions has a dou|ble Task, and that the Seas and dry Land were di&s;tingui&s;h'd, and the Vegetables produc'd on the &s;ame Day or Year of the Creation; according as from the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory the pre&s;ent Propo&s;i|tion a&s;&s;erts. And if we allow for the defect of the inequalities of the outward Surface, too &s;mall to be therein con&s;ider'd; and &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> &s;omewhat clearer than before; the former Figure will &s;till &s;erve well enough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Theor. p. 39. <HI>&amp; &s;u|pra.</HI></NOTE> and repre&s;ent the progre&s;s and &s;tate of the Earth at the Conclu&s;ion of this <HI>Third Day</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>Corollary 1. <HI>Since according to our pre&s;ent Ac|counts of the&s;e Matters, this is the only day of the Creation to which a double work, and that the one quite different from the other, ought to be a&s;crib'd, and is a&s;crib'd by</HI> Mo&s;es; <HI>The</HI> Night <HI>being peculiar|ly fit for the former, and the</HI> Day <HI>for the latter Ope|ration; which could happen on none of the other Pe|riods; This exactne&s;s of corre&s;pondence ought to be e&s;teem'd an Evidence of the literal Sen&s;e of the Wri|ter, and of his Accommodation to the nature of things;

For &s;ince at his Ri&s;ing the Earth and lowe&s;t Regions of the Air were very full of moi&s;ture, while the higher Regions were very clear and bright, the force of his heat would be &s;o great as to elevate con&s;iderable quantities of Vapours on a &s;udden, and thereby (e're the lowe&s;t Air had depo&s;ited its Vapours, and rendred it &s;elf tran&s;parent) the Sun would anew hide him&s;elf in a thick Mi&s;t, and &s;o prevent his own becoming con&s;picuous, which otherwi&s;e 'tis not impro|bable he might this Day have been.</HI></P>

upon it; yet is it by no means to be &s;uppos'd that his Body was Vi&s;ible all that while. Tho' we every Day enjoy much more Light and Heat from the Sun than the Primitive Earth could, for a con&s;iderable &s;pace, be &s;uppos'd to have done, yet 'tis but &s;ometimes that the Air is &s;o clear as to render his Body di&s;cernible by us. A very few Clouds or Vapours gather'd to|gether in our Air are able, we &s;ee, to hinder &s;uch a pro&s;pect for Weeks, if not Months together; while yet at the &s;ame time we are &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of his Force and Influence in the con|&s;tant Productions of Nature. Which things be|ing duly con&s;ider'd, and the va&s;tne&s;s and den|&s;ity of the <HI>Upper Chaos</HI> allow'd for, 'twill be but rea&s;onable to afford a great &s;pace, even after the fir&s;t penetration of Light, for the entire clearing of the Atmo&s;phere, and the di&s;tinct view of the Sun's Body by a Spectator on the Surface of the Earth.

For the Brute Bea&s;ts were pro|duced out of the Earth, as the Fi&s;h and Fowl had been before out of the Waters: But after that, the Body of <HI>Adam</HI> was formed of the Du&s;t of the Ground; and by the Breath of Life breath'd into him in a peculiar manner, he became a Living Soul. Some time after which, on the &s;ame Day, he was ca&s;t into a deep Sleep, and <HI>Eve</HI> was form'd of a Rib taken from his &s;ide.

It being both un|fit and impo&s;&s;ible for the Divine Nature of the Father, to be &s;o much, and in &s;uch a manner concern'd with the Corporeal World, and the &s;in|ful Race of Mankind, as we find here and every where this <HI>Divine Per&s;on</HI>, our Ble&s;&s;ed Mediator, to have been; as the Texts here quoted compar'd together do, I think, fully prove. Seeing, there|fore, our Saviour Chri&s;t, God-Man, was per&s;o|nally pre&s;ent, and actually employ'd in this Primitive Creation of the World: Seeing Man was to be a Creature entirely different from all the re&s;t, a Being compounded of a Spiritual and Immortal Soul, and of a Material and Corrupti|ble Body: Seeing in both the&s;e he was to be made in the Likene&s;s of that Divine Per&s;on who was the In&s;trument of the Father in his Creation, and to be con&s;tituted his Deputy and Vicegerent among the Creatures here below; 'twas but rea|&s;onable there &s;hould be as great a Di&s;tinction in his Original, as was to be in his Nature and Fa|culties, his Office and Dignity, his Capacities and Happine&s;s from the other Parts of the vi&s;ible Creation; and by con&s;equence, that peculiar In|terpo&s;ition
<PB N="332" REF="438">
of God him&s;elf in the Formation of the Body, and Infu&s;ion of the Soul of our fir&s;t Parents, &s;o particularly ob&s;ervable in the <HI>Mo|&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory, is both very agreeable to the Na|ture of Things, very &s;uitable to the Wi&s;dom of God, and very reconcileable to the mo&s;t Philo|&s;ophick Accounts of this Origin of the World; and withal, a remarkable Token of the Dignity of Human Nature, of the Di&s;tinction between his Soul and Body, and of the great Conde&s;cen|&s;ion and Love of God towards us, and &s;o the mo&s;t highly worthy of our Con&s;ideration. Neither is the other Circum&s;tance, the peculiar <HI>Time</HI> of the Creation of Man, to be pa&s;s'd over without a proper Reflection on it. 'Twere ea&s;y to &s;hew, that none of the preceding Days were, in any degree, &s;o fit for, nay, mo&s;t of them, not capa|ble of this Creation and Introduction of Man: But upon this Sixth Period, when every thing which could be &s;ub&s;ervient to him, and advance his Felicity, was compleated; He who was to be the Lord of All, and for who&s;e &s;ake the whole was fram'd, was brought into the World. When the <HI>Light</HI> had been penetrating into, and clarify|ing this dark and thick <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> for more than five compleat <HI>Years</HI> together; when the Air was freed from its numberle&s;s Vapours, and become pure, clear, and fit for his Re&s;piration; when the <HI>Waters</HI>, as well <HI>&s;uperior</HI> as <HI>inferior</HI>, were &s;o di&s;pos'd as to mini&s;ter to his Nece&s;&s;ities by Mi&s;ts and Dews from the Heavens, and by Springs and Ri|vers from the Earth; when the <HI>Surface of the Earth</HI> was become dry and &s;olid for his Support, and was cover'd over with Trees, Shrubs, Plants, Herbs, Gra&s;s and Flowers for his Su&s;tenance and Delight; when the glorious <HI>Firmament of Heaven</HI>, and the beautiful Sy&s;tem of the <HI>Sun, Moon</HI> and <HI>Stars</HI>,
<PB N="333" REF="439">
were vi&s;ible and con&s;picuous to him, the Objects of his Contemplation, the Di&s;tingui&s;hers of his Sea&s;ons; by who&s;e powerful Influences the Earth was invigorated, and the World rendred a fruit|ful and u&s;eful, a light&s;ome and plea&s;ant Habita|tion to him; when, la&s;tly, <HI>all &s;orts of Animals</HI> in the <HI>Seas</HI>, in the <HI>Air</HI>, or on the <HI>Earth</HI>, were &s;o di&s;pos'd as to attend, benefit, and plea&s;e him one way or other; when, I &s;ay, all the&s;e things were by the Care, Beneficence, and Providence of God, prepar'd for the Entertainment of this principal Gue&s;t, then, and not till then, was <HI>Man</HI> created and introduc'd into the World: Then, and not before, was <HI>He</HI> con&s;tituted the Lord and Go|vernor of the whole. In which entire Procedure the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of the Creator, and the Dignity and Honour of his principal Creature here below, are equally con&s;ulted; and the greate&s;t Occa&s;ion imaginable given to our fir&s;t Pa|rents, and all their Po&s;terity, of adoring and ce|lebrating the Divine Bounty to them in the pre|&s;ent and &s;ucceeding Ages.

And that each of the&s;e Seas, Springs, with their Rivers, and Mountains, were generally the &s;ame, and in the &s;ame Places as the pre&s;ent, there is no rea&s;on to doubt; they being u&s;ually the very &s;ame Indivl|duals then and now, and &s;o unque&s;tionably can|not have chang'd their primary Situations.</P>
<Q>XVIII. The Waters of the Seas in the Primitive Earth were <HI>Salt</HI>, and tho&s;e of the Rivers <HI>Fre&s;h</HI>; as they are at pre&s;ent, and each, as now, were then &s;tor'd with great Plenty of Fi&s;h.</Q>
<P N="18">XVIII. This has no Difficulty in it, &s;eeing the pre&s;ent Seas are either the very &s;ame, or at lea&s;t of the &s;ame nature; and both would become &s;alt in the &s;ame manner, by the Di&s;&s;olution of the Saline among the other Mineral Particles in the Fluid <HI>Chaos</HI>, or Atmo&s;phere of a Comet.

<P N="19"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. 82. c&ugrave;m Co|rol. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE>XIX. The pre&s;ence of the <HI>Moon</HI> and <HI>Sun</HI> be|ing the cau&s;e of the Tides, and tho&s;e Bodies by con&s;equence being equally di&s;pos'd before, as &s;ince the Deluge, to produce them, this Propo&s;i|tion can have no manner of difficulty, Only we may take notice of the&s;e two things, (1.) That in the State of Innocence, before the Diurnal Revolution began, the frequency of the Tide mu&s;t depend on the <HI>Lunar</HI> Period, and happen but twice in each Month, as now it does in &s;omewhat above a Day's time with us: On which account, the Increa&s;e and Decrea&s;e of the Waters would be extreamly gentle, lei&s;urely, and gradual, with|out any imaginable Violence or Precipitation. (2.) That in the whole <HI>Antediluvian</HI> State, the Tides were le&s;&s;er than &s;ince, by rea&s;on of the &s;mallne&s;s of the Seas <HI>then</HI> in compari&s;on of the great Ocean, from whence <HI>now</HI> the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable ones are deriv'd. All which yet hinders not but they might be &s;en&s;ible enough in &s;ome Creeks, Bays, and Mouths of Rivers: The pecu|liar Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e Places in <HI>that</HI>, as well as in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> State, rendring the Tides, the Elevations and Depre&s;&s;ions of the Waters <HI>there</HI>, mo&s;t con&s;iderable and violent of all others.</P>
<Q>XX. The Productions of the primitive Earth, as far as we can gue&s;s by the remainders of them at the De|luge, differ'd little or nothing from tho&s;e of the pre|&s;ent, either in Figure, Magnitude, Texture of Parts, or any other corre&s;pondent re&s;pect.</Q>
<P N="20">XX. The&s;e things &s;eem to depend on two particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> partly on the primary Bigne&s;s, Figure, and Con&s;titution of the con&s;tituent, in|&s;en&s;ible Parts or Elements of Bodies; and partly on the quantity of Heat made u&s;e of in their

Production or Coalition; which being &s;uppos'd, the Propo&s;ition will ea&s;ily be e&s;tabli&s;h'd. For, as to the fir&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e they remain invariably the &s;ame in all Ages, and are by any natural Power unalterable. And as to the la&s;t, whatever is to be &s;aid of the State of Innocence, or the fir&s;t Ages &s;ucceeding, on &s;ome peculiar Accounts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phaenom. 23. &amp; 27. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> which I believe might be warmer than at pre&s;ent; yet as to the Times here referr'd to, there is no need to &s;uppo&s;e any great Difference of Heat, either from the <HI>Sun</HI>, or the Central Body: And, indeed, all the Difference on any accounts to be &s;uppos'd between the Heat before and &s;ince the Deluge, mu&s;t be too incon&s;iderable to be taken notice of in any &s;uch &s;en&s;ible Effects as this Propo&s;ition does refer to. For the <HI>Sun</HI>'s heat was not above a Twenty fifth part greater than 'tis now, and the Space of four or five thou&s;and Years makes no mighty difference in that of the Central Solid, if at fir&s;t it were heated any whit near the degree mention'd in the Calculation referr'd to in the Margin. And tho' its real Heat were decreas'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. 68. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> yet in ca&s;e its Facility of Penetration were in|creas'd in the &s;ame Proportion, the Heat on the Face of the Earth would &s;till be equal and in|variable. And &s;o by the&s;e Accounts, the Pro|ductions of Nature in all Ages mu&s;t be pretty equal and agreeable, as this Propo&s;ition requires.</P>
<P>Corollary. <HI>Tho' the Lives of the</HI> Antediluvians <HI>were &s;o much longer than ours at pre&s;ent, yet were they not generally of a more Gigantick Stature than the pa&s;t or pre&s;ent Generations &s;ince have been. In all which Ages, notwith&s;tanding, there have been &s;ome of an extraordinary Bigne&s;s and Stature, and there will be &s;till no doubt in the future Ages to the end of the World.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="340" REF="446">XXI. The Primitive Earth had &s;uch <HI>Metals</HI> and <HI>Mi|nerals</HI> in it, as the pre&s;ent has.</Q>

<Q>XXII. Arts and Sciences were invented and improved in the fir&s;t Ages of the World, as well as they &s;ince have been.</Q>
<P N="22">XXII. There is little need of giving particular Rea&s;ons for this. All I &s;hall ob&s;erve is, That &s;eeing the Ignorance and Barbarity of the Ages after the Deluge, is the greate&s;t Objection again&s;t this Propo&s;ition, 'tis avoided in our <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. A Solution of the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> relating to the <HI>Primitive</HI> State of the Earth.</HEAD>
<Q>XXIII. The <HI>Primitive</HI> State of the Earth admitted of the primary Production of Animals out of the Wa|ters and Dry Ground, which the &s;ub&s;equent States, otherwi&s;e than in the ordinary Method of Genera|tion, have been uncapable of.</Q>
<P N="23">XXIII. 'TIS not to be expected that I &s;hould here be able to give a full and me|thodical Account of the Growth of the <HI>Primitive</HI> Pairs of Animals, and of the &s;everal Di&s;po&s;itions of the <HI>Primigenial</HI> State of Nature &s;ub&s;ervient or contributary thereto. The Method of the Gene|ration of Animals is in it &s;elf in general &s;o little known, and the Hi&s;tory of this fir&s;t Stage of the World, as well &s;o &s;hort in the Sacred Writings, as &s;o difficult to be, in all its Circum&s;tances, now otherwi&s;e under&s;tood, that &s;uch an Attempt might ju&s;tly be look'd upon as too ra&s;h a Pre&s;umption. All that ought to be expected, and all that I &s;hall endeavour is this; To &s;hew, that as far as is known of that Original Earth, its Properties were as peculiarly fit for, as tho&s;e oppo&s;ite ones of the &s;ucceeding are capable of, &s;uch a Pro|duction of Animals at fir&s;t, as this Propo&s;ition takes notice of; which the Five following Par|ticulars &s;hall include.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hypoth. 3. prius.</NOTE> (1.) The long and con|tinued Spaces of Day and Night in the <HI>Primitive State</HI> did capacitate it for &s;uch Productions; which the quick Returns of the &s;ame afterward prohibited. 'Twill be ea&s;ily granted, that in the Generation of Animals there mu&s;t be a pretty
<PB N="342" REF="448">
con&s;tant and continual Warmth, without the frequent Interpo&s;ition of Cold during the mo&s;t part of the Proce&s;s. Now this the long Days of nine or ten Months afforded the&s;e Primary <HI>Em|brio</HI>'s; which the &s;hort ones of only twelve &s;mall Hours, and the &s;udden and frequent Returns of equal Nights, has utterly deny'd to any &s;uch ever &s;ince. (2.) The <HI>Primitive</HI> Earth was moi&s;t and juicy enough to &s;upply nouri&s;hment all the time of the Generation of the <HI>Faetus</HI>; which, after it was once become perfectly dry and &s;olid, was not again to be expected.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Solut. 7. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> It was before ob&s;erv'd, that upon the De&s;cent of the va&s;t Quantities of Va|pours on the Third Day, the Ground was &s;o tender, &s;oft, and full of Juices, as very naturally an&s;wered to what all Antiquity made the Fund and Promptuary of the ri&s;ing Plants and Ani|mals, the famous <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. And as that was but a nece&s;&s;ary Qualification of a Soil which was to produce Animals, &s;o the want of it ever &s;ince has taken away all Hopes of a like Propagation. (3.) The <HI>Primitive</HI> State of the Earth and Air, where the Animals were produc'd, had Heat &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, which the Sub&s;e|quent has not. 'Tis evident that a greater Heat than the pre&s;ent Earth or ambient Air can af|ford, is requi&s;ite to, and made u&s;e of in the pre|&s;ent Generation of Animals, (which the Incu|bation in the Oviparous, and the &s;till warmer Po&s;ition of the <HI>Faetus</HI> in the Viviparous Animals a&s;&s;ure us of:) On which account the pre&s;ent Earth mu&s;t needs be incapable of their Pro|duction. But that the Heat in the <HI>Primitive</HI> Earth, and particularly where the Animals were produc'd, was much greater, will thus appear. As to the Heat from the Central Body, while the Earth was &s;omewhat loo&s;e, and pretty freely
<PB N="343" REF="449">
admitted the a&s;cending Steams, that would be con&s;iderably greater than after its more entire Con&s;olidation, when the&s;e Steams were thereby &s;o much confin'd within or diverted to &s;ome particular Receptacles. Be&s;ides the Production of Animals was near <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI>, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, no where el&s;e. Now tho&s;e middle Regions, (of which <HI>Eden</HI>, the Country of <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hypoth. 4. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> was one) being &s;ituate near the ancient Ecliptick, and pre&s;ent Tropick, (of which before) enjoy'd al&s;o a greater Heat from the &s;ame Central Body, by rea&s;on of their greater nearne&s;s thereto, than &s;ince, they, or the corre&s;ponding Parts of the <HI>Torrid Zone</HI> do, or can partake of. For &s;ince the Earth was then perfectly Spherical,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. 70, 71. cum. coroll. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> the mid|dle, and their neighbouring Parts, were about 15 or 16 Miles nearer the Central Solid than the &s;ame Regions now are: (They being in that Proportion elevated, and the Circumpopular de|pre&s;s'd at the commencing of the <HI>Diurnal Rota|tion</HI>:) Which greater Vicinity of the Central Heat mu&s;t certainly have a &s;uitable Effect, and cau&s;e &s;omewhat warmer Regions thereabouts than they have been ever &s;ince. Moreover, if the real proper Heat of the Central Solid be in any con&s;iderable Proportion dimini&s;h'd in near 6000 Years time, (as in <HI>&s;ome</HI> Proportion it mu&s;t be) That degree of Heat which it had at fir&s;t, was &s;till the mo&s;t powerful of all other ever &s;ince. But then as to the Solar Heat, 'tis evi|dent that Paradi&s;e, &s;ituate near the very Eclip|tick it &s;elf, mu&s;t receive almo&s;t the utmo&s;t Power of the &s;ame Heat which any part of the Globe were capable of, which by lying beyond the Tro|pick afterward it would not do. On all which accounts join'd together, 'tis evident tha the Heat in the <HI>Primitive</HI> State was much more con&s;idera|ble,
<PB N="344" REF="450">
and &s;o much more adapted to the Gene|ration of Animals than that in the &s;ub&s;equent ever was or can po&s;&s;ibly be.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phaenom. 41. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> (4.) The <HI>Primi|tive</HI> State was perfectly &s;till and calm; free from all &s;uch Winds, Storms, violent Tides, or any the like Hurries and Di&s;orders as at pre&s;ent wholly render the Production of Animals impo&s;&s;ible: Which quiet Condition, if in &s;ome re&s;pects it en|dur'd till the Deluge, yet, as even in tho&s;e the Paradi&s;iacal State might have the Pre-eminence; &s;o in others, particularly the Gentlene&s;s of the Tides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Solut. 19. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> it had &s;till the mo&s;t peculiar Advantage; as was before ob&s;erv'd. (5.) The Equability of Sea&s;ons, and the greater Uniformity of the Air's Temperature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Phaenom. 38. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> which in part remain'd till the Deluge, but might be more &s;ignal in the <HI>Pa|radi&s;iacal</HI> State, render'd that Earth as proper, as the contrary &s;udden, uncertain, and violent Ex|tremes of Heat and Cold, Drought and Moi&s;ture, &s;ultry and fro&s;ty Weather now, wholly indi&s;po&s;e it, for &s;uch a Production of Animals. Which Prerogatives of the <HI>Primitive</HI> Earth and Air will certainly demon&s;trate, if not its entire fitne&s;s, yet &s;ure its le&s;s unfitne&s;s for &s;uch an original Generation as was here to be accounted for; and is all, as was before ob&s;erv'd, that can ju&s;tly be requir'd and expected in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Solut. 2. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE>Corollary. <HI>Since it has been before allow'd that all Generation is but Nutrition; and that all Seeds, as well of Animals, as of Plants, are the immediate Workman&s;hip of God; 'tis evident that this Suppo|&s;ition of the original Production of Animals out of the Waters and Earth; according to the plaine&s;t Letter of the</HI> Mo&s;aick <HI>Hi&s;tory, does by no means derogate from the Divine Efficiency, and the won|derful Art and Skill in the Structure of their Bo|dies;

<Q>XXIV. The Con&s;titution of Man in his <HI>Primitive</HI> State was very different from that ever &s;ince the Fall; not only as to the Temper and Perfections of his Soul, but as to the Nature and Di&s;po&s;ition of his Body al&s;o.</Q>
<P N="24">XXIV. The Book of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> affords us &s;o &s;hort a Hi&s;tory of this <HI>Primitive</HI> Stage of the World, and of the Con&s;titution of Man therein; and all other Hi&s;tories are &s;o incon&s;iderable in this re&s;pect, that a particular Account of all things relating to this Propo&s;ition is by no means to be expected. 'Tis in general &s;ufficient, that we have, from Sacred and Prophane Authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. 73. cum Co|roll. &amp; Hypoth. 3. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> evinc'd the State of External Nature to have been mighty different from the pre&s;ent; and that con&s;equently the State of Man, even on Philo&s;ophical Con&s;iderations, ought to be &s;up|pos'd equally different from the pre&s;ent al&s;o. And 'tis &s;o highly unrea&s;onable from meer Ob|&s;ervations made now to pa&s;s a Cen&s;ure on what was done then; and from the Frail, Imperfect, Sinful, and Mi&s;erable Condition of Human Nature in our Days, to judge of the &s;ame in its State of Innocence, Perfection and Felicity; or from the Circum&s;tances it is in at pre&s;ent, to determine tho&s;e it mu&s;t at that time have been in; that nothing can be more &s;o. We might almo&s;t as well argue that <HI>Angels</HI> Eat and Drink, Sleep and Wake, Work and Re&s;t, be|cau&s;e <HI>We</HI> do &s;o; or that the <HI>Infant</HI> in the Womb &s;ees and hears, talks and di&s;cour&s;es, reads and writes, becau&s;e afterward <HI>He</HI> commonly does the &s;ame things; as that becau&s;e <HI>We</HI> have
<PB N="346" REF="452">
need of Cloathing to cover our Shame, and have Inflexible, Robu&s;t, and in a certain time Corruptible Temperaments of Body, therefore &s;o had our <HI>Primitive Parents</HI> in the State of Inno|cency. But to &s;peak &s;omewhat more di&s;tinctly to tho&s;e two particulars included under this Pro|po&s;ition. (1.) That in the Actions relating to the Propagation of the <HI>Species</HI>, there &s;hould be no Sen&s;e of Shame, and con&s;equently no Occa&s;ion for covering &s;uch Parts as were therein concern'd, is by no means &s;trange, in a State of Innocence; where there was no Inclination to any &s;inful Kind or Degree of Application, and where all &s;uch <HI>Inferior</HI> Appetites were in compleat &s;ub|jection to the <HI>Superior</HI>, the Rea&s;on and Con|&s;cience of Man. 'Tis rather an evident Token of our Guilt, a Demon&s;tration of the Di&s;order and Pollution of our Nature and Faculties <HI>now</HI>, that what in permitted Circum&s;tances, is inno|cent and natural in it &s;elf, nay nece&s;&s;ary for the Propagation of the <HI>Species</HI>, and the Pre&s;erva|tion of Mankind, &s;hould make us blu&s;h: 'Tis a plain Note of the Vilene&s;s of our pre&s;ent State, a Mark of the Ba&s;ene&s;s of our Condition <HI>now</HI>, that what God and Nature have ordain'd for the Continuation of the World, &s;hould yet inevita|bly &s;eem to have &s;omething of Indecency and Turpitude adhering to it So far, that meer Ba&s;h|fulne&s;s and Mode&s;ty oblige us to conceal and pa&s;s over in Silence all that belongs thereto. It indeed might more rea&s;onably be made a Query, why the Covering of our Nakedne&s;s has been &s;o general, and is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary <HI>now</HI>, (as it has ju&s;tly by all Ages and Nations been e&s;teem'd,) than why it was otherwi&s;e in this <HI>Primitive</HI> State of the World. (2.) That the u&s;e of one &s;ort of Food (that of the <HI>Tree of Life</HI>) might be ca|pable
<PB N="347" REF="453">
of fixing and &s;ettling the Temper of a Hu|man Body, of rendring it &s;o la&s;ting, that, while its Earthly Condition was to continue, it might never be di&s;&s;olv'd; and that the U&s;e of a contrary Sort of Food, (That of the <HI>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil</HI>,) might be capable of &s;o far corrupting and di&s;ordering the &s;ame, that it would become &s;ubject to Sickne&s;s, Mi&s;ery, and Di&s;&s;olution in a &s;horter Space, is, I think, even by what we at pre&s;ent &s;ee, by no means incredible. We cannot but ob&s;erve how great a Change a Cour&s;e of Diet, moderate, whole|&s;ome, and agreeable, will make in our pre&s;ent Temperament for the better; and on the con|trary, how far an intemperate, and immoderate Indulgence of our Appetites, either as to the Kinds or Quantities of our Meats and Drinks, tho' but for a few Weeks or Months, will do the &s;ame for the wor&s;e; even to the &s;poiling and de&s;troying of a very good Habit of Body, to the depriving Men of their Healths, nay fre|quently of their Lives too by a violent Di&s;ea&s;e. If we therefore, to take the narrowe&s;t Suppo&s;i|tion, imagine the eating of that pernicious and forbidden Fruit to have been confin'd to one Day or Year of this Primitive State, (which yet there is no nece&s;&s;ity of doing;) 'twill be no har&s;h or incredible &s;uppo&s;al; e&s;pecially, if we con&s;ider what has been &s;aid of the pre&s;ent State of Things, and how much more the temper of our fir&s;t Parents Bodies, and the particular Food on which they fed, might be peculiarly fitted for the &s;ame Purpo&s;es; that the intemperate Indul|gence of a very pe&s;tilent Cour&s;e of Diet for &s;o many Months together might break and pervert the well-temper'd Con&s;titutions of our fir&s;t Pa|rents, might render their Bodies liable to &s;uch
<PB N="348" REF="454">
Di&s;tempers as in length of time would di&s;&s;olve, and entirely overthrow them; or, in other words would <HI>render Mankind &s;ickly, mi&s;erable, and mortal Creatures for ever after</HI>. Which is, I think, e|nough to clear the Propo&s;ition before us, &s;o far as a bare <HI>Phy&s;ical Theory</HI> is concern'd therein.</P>
<Q>XXV. The Female was then very different from what &s;he is now; particularly &s;he was in a State of great|er Equality with the Male, and little more &s;ubject to Sorrow in the Propagation of Po&s;terity than he.</Q>
<P N="25">XXV. That the original State and Circum|&s;tances of the Female, &s;hould be as they are here repre&s;ented, is &s;o far from being &s;trange, that the contrary ones of that Sex at pre&s;ent, were not the occa&s;ion thereof known, might much more ju&s;tly appear &s;o. For granting the Equa|lity of human Souls in them&s;elves, 'tis not very ea&s;y to give a good rea&s;on, why that Part which one half of Mankind was to bear in the Propa|gation of it, &s;hould &s;ubject it to &s;uch a low Con|dition, great Weakne&s;s of Nature, and tho&s;e &s;e|vere Pains and Agonies which did not at all af|fect the other; as God and Nature have at pre|&s;ent made unavoidable. And as to the change of her Name after the Fall, from <HI>Adamah</HI> and <HI>I&s;h&s;hah</HI> to <HI>Eve</HI> (which latter &s;eems to denote her Capacity <HI>then attain'd</HI> of becoming the Mother of all tho&s;e Generations of Mankind which were afterward to live on the Face of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. v. 2. &amp; ii.23, 24. with iii.v. 20.</NOTE>) it may probably intimate, (to omit any other Ob|&s;ervations that might be made on it,) &s;ome change in the Method or Circum&s;tances con|cerning human Generation. And if we con|&s;ider, that <HI>Adam</HI> and his <HI>Wife</HI> were no incon&s;i|derable time in Paradi&s;e together, even after the Ble&s;&s;ing of Increa&s;e and Multiply, before their
<PB N="349" REF="455">
Fall; and carefully con&s;ider the Texts quoted in the Margin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. ii.25 and iii.7, 10, 11. and iv.1.</NOTE> and that part of the ancient Tradi|tion in <HI>Plato</HI> which is quoted under the 23d <HI>Phae|nomena</HI> foregoing, we &s;hall perhaps believe 'tis no improbable conjecture.</P>
<Q>XXVI. The other Terre&s;trial Animals were in a &s;tate of greater Capacities and Operations; nearer ap|proaching to rea&s;on and di&s;cour&s;e; and partakers of higher degrees of Perfection and Happine&s;s, than they have been ever &s;ince.</Q>
<P N="26">XXVI. Since the <HI>Primitive</HI> State of External Nature was &s;o exceeding different from the pre|&s;ent, as has been already prov'd; the other Ter|re&s;trial Animals, as well as Man, ought to be &s;uppos'd of a &s;omewhat proportionably diffe|rent Temper, Abilities and Actions. Be&s;ides, the Divine Providence is concern'd to &s;uit one Being to another; and to accommodate &s;till the Subordinate, to the <HI>Superior</HI> Rank of Crea|tures in the World: On which account 'tis not &s;trange, that the Brute Animals were in their Primitive Con&s;titution very much di&s;tingui&s;h'd from, and advanc'd above &s;uch as are now upon the Earth; the Diver&s;ity with relation to Man|kind, to whom in each Period they were to be &s;ub&s;ervient, being &s;o very remarkable. For &s;ince Mankind upon the Fall degenerated into a Sen&s;ual and Bruti&s;h Way of Living, the Brute Creatures them&s;elves would very unwillingly have paid their due Homage and Submi&s;&s;ion, had not they in &s;ome degree degenerated from their Primitive Dignity at the &s;ane time. Which de|generacy being &s;uppos'd, a former greater degree of Abilities, Operations, and Happine&s;s is at the &s;ame time &s;uppos'd al&s;o. And to &s;trengthen this Conjecture, I may venture to appeal to <HI>Anatomy</HI>, whether the pre&s;ent Bodies of Brutes do not

appear capable, as far as can be di&s;cover'd, of no|bler Operations, than we ever now ob&s;erve from them. The Advantage of even <HI>Mankind</HI> in this re&s;pect &s;eeming not very con&s;iderable over the <HI>Brutes that peri&s;h</HI>.</P>
<Q>XXVII. The Temper of the Air, where our fir&s;t Pa|rents liv'd, was warmer, and the Heat greater be|fore the Fall than &s;ince.</Q>
<P N="27">XXVII. This has been already accounted for in the Twenty Third Propo&s;ition before.</P>

<P N="28">XXVIII. That we may account for this Pro|po&s;ition, and that Cur&s;e which was inflicted on the Ground at the Fall, in good Mea&s;ure inclu|ded therein; we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the Growth of Plants and Vegetables depends on a degree of Heat proportionate to the peculiar Temper and Exigence of each <HI>Species</HI>; and by con&s;e|quence that, let the Number of Seeds in any Soil be never &s;o many, or their Kinds never &s;o diver&s;e, yet the Surface of the Earth mu&s;t re|main bare and barren, until the peculiar Heat of the Sea&s;on and Climate be adapted to them: Now &s;eeing different Kinds of Seeds require dif|ferent degrees of Heat, 'tis only &s;uch certain Kinds of the &s;ame that will at once &s;hew them|&s;elves, or &s;pring out of the Earth; the re&s;t, to which the Heat is not adju&s;ted, lying all the while as Dormant and Dead as if they did not really exi&s;t in Nature. Thus we have &s;everal di&s;tinct Crops of Vegetables in the &s;everal Sea|&s;ons of the Year. Tho&s;e Seeds which the &s;mall Heat of <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March</HI> is not able to rai&s;e,

lie &s;till in the Earth till the greater Force of the Sun in <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May</HI> excite them.

Nay, when in the Months of <HI>September</HI> and <HI>Octo|ber</HI> the Sun's Power is dimini&s;h'd, and its Heat but about equivalent to that of <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April</HI>, it again &s;uits the Plants which were then in Sea|&s;on; &s;o that they many of them &s;pring up afre&s;h in <HI>the&s;e</HI> Months, and flouri&s;h over anew, as before they did in <HI>tho&s;e</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">E&s;&s;ay. p. 267, &amp;c.</NOTE> as Dr. <HI>Woodward</HI> ve|ry well di&s;cour&s;es upon this occa&s;ion. In like manner we may al&s;o con&s;ider this matter with re|lation to the different Climates and Zones of the Earth, and their quite different Crops of Plants, according to tho&s;e different degrees of Heat made u&s;e of in their Vegetation. When therefore we ob&s;erve in the &s;ame Country a various Crop and Order of Vegetables every Year, according to the various Power of Heat in each &s;ea&s;on; (a different Face of the Earth being gradually vi|&s;ible from <HI>February</HI> till <HI>July</HI>, in proportion to the gradual increa&s;e of Heat all that &s;pace;) we cannot tell, in ca&s;e the Heat increas'd &s;till to a greater Inten&s;ene&s;s afterward, but a new and un&s;een Face of things might &s;till appear; and many unheard-of Kinds of Vegetables might put forth, and expo&s;e them&s;elves to our Ob&s;ervation, even in the pre&s;ent State and Age of the World. But as to the Primitive World, wherein all the Seeds of tho&s;e Vegetables which God originally Created were fre&s;h and vegetous, and wherein there was a greater Heat than &s;ince has been to in|vigorate and produce them; 'tis very rea&s;onable,
<PB N="352" REF="458">
and very agreeable to Nature to &s;uppo&s;e, that many Sorts of Trees, Plants, Herbs and Flowers, which the colder temper of the &s;ub&s;equent Earth was unable to excite and produce, were then eve|ry Year rais'd, and became the principal Recrea|tion and Su&s;tenance of our fir&s;t Parents in the &s;tate of Innocency. 'Tis very probable they might never &s;ee &s;uch a Poor, Jejune, and Degenerate State of the Vegetable Kingdom as we &s;ince have done, till their unhappy Fall occa&s;ion'd the Intro|duction of that mi&s;erable Condition of all things which has ever &s;ince continu'd among us. Thus as one Country or Climate, becau&s;e of its greater Coldne&s;s, is now the Seminary of &s;everal Vegeta|bles which the warmer Regions are either perfect Strangers to, or advanc'd to a greater degree of Perfection; &s;o upon the degeneracy of the Prime|val State into the pre&s;ent, and the Abatement of the Ancient Heat (taken together with the wor&s;e Juices and other effects of that Abatement contri|butary perhaps to the &s;ame thing) 'tis natural to allow that &s;everal &s;uch Vegetables (&s;uppo&s;e <HI>Thorns</HI> and <HI>Thi&s;tles</HI>) which were before either perfect &s;trangers to, or had been advanc'd to a greater de|gree of perfection by the Juices and Warmth of Paradi&s;e, became the con&s;tant and trouble&s;ome Heirlooms there; to the no little Regret of our fir&s;t Parents; who till then had only &s;een and en|joy'd the better Set of the <HI>Primigenial</HI> Vegeta|bles.

<P><HI>Scholium.</HI> 'Twill be here, I imagine, not im|proper to remind the Reader once for all of the Nature and Effects of that extraordinary <HI>Change</HI>, which the Fall of Man, and the con&s;equent Cur&s;e of God brought upon the Earth: That he may with the greater Ea&s;e, of his own Accord, view and compare the States of External Nature be|fore and after the Fall one with another, and with tho&s;e things which the Propo&s;itions we are now upon do a&s;&s;ert concerning them. 'Tis evi|dent then, from what has been before laid down hereto relating, that the primitive &s;tate of things before the Fall was thus: The Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. 70, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &amp; Hy|poth 3. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> being newly form'd, was &s;carcely as yet entirely con|&s;olidated, and &s;o pretty uniformly pervious to the warm Steams a&s;cending from beneath. Its Figure was perfectly Spherical, and its <HI>Strata</HI> or <HI>Layers</HI> by con&s;equence were even, continu'd, and join'd; and &s;o the Central Heat, being e|qually di&s;tant from all the Parts of the Earth's Surface, did very equally diffu&s;e it &s;elf, and equal|ly affect all the Climates of the Globe. The Soil or uppermo&s;t <HI>Stratum</HI> of the Earth was newly moi&s;ten'd by the de&s;cent of the Waters, before they compos'd the Seas on the Third Day of the Creation, and by the plenty of Moi&s;ture which it &s;till receiv'd every Night. The Air was perfectly Clear, Homogeneous, Tran&s;parent, and Su&s;ceptive of the utmo&s;t Power of the Solar Heat. The Sea&s;ons were equable, or gently and gradually di&s;tingui&s;h'd from one another, by the Ri&s;ing, Setting, De&s;cending and A&s;cend|ing Sun, without any quick Interpo&s;itions of
<PB N="354" REF="460">
Day and Night to di&s;turb them. The <HI>Torrid Zone</HI> of the Earth, as I may call tho&s;e Regions near the Solar Cour&s;e, was very much Expos'd to the Sun, and &s;omewhat more warm'd withal by its greater Nearne&s;s to the Central Solid. The <HI>Moon</HI> in twelve or more Revolutions equally mea|&s;ured out the Year, and caus'd the mo&s;t gentle, ea&s;y, and gradual Tides imaginable. This with all its natural Con&s;equents, was the State of the <HI>Primi|tive</HI> World. But as &s;oon as Man had &s;inn'd and render'd that happy State too good for him, or indeed rendred him&s;elf wholly uncapable there|of; and as &s;oon as God Almighty had pro|nounc'd a Cur&s;e on the Ground, and its Pro|ductions, pre&s;ently the Earth began a new and &s;trange Motion, and revolv'd from <HI>We&s;t</HI> to <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> on its own <HI>Axis</HI>: A &s;ingle <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or Revolu|tion of Night and Day, return'd frequently, and became no longer than 24 &s;hort Hours; while the <HI>Annual</HI> Motion, perform'd on a dif|ferent <HI>Axis</HI>, di&s;tingui&s;h'd the Sea&s;ons; and in Conjunction with the <HI>Diurnal</HI>, de&s;crib'd the Equa|tor, and the Tropicks; and by the Acce&s;s and Re|ce&s;s of the Sun from the la&s;t named Circles, caus'd it to vi&s;it the &s;everal Regions enclos'd thereby. The Face of the Earth was really di&s;tingui&s;h'd into <HI>Zones</HI>, by the Tropicks and Polar Circles, truly divided from one another; with re&s;pect whereto the particular Regions of the Earth chang'd their Situation; the Equator being that Circle with regard whereto they were now to be determin'd, as they had been before with regard to the Ecliptick; and &s;o that Paradi&s;e which was before near the middle or Ecliptick was now be|yond the <HI>Northern</HI> Tropick or Boundary of the <HI>Torrid Zone</HI>. The Figure of the Earth, which was before truly Spherical, degenerated into an
<PB N="355" REF="461">
<HI>Oblate Spheroid</HI>; the <HI>Torrid Zone</HI> ri&s;ing about 15 or 16 Miles upward, and the <HI>Frigid</HI> one &s;ub&s;i|ding as much downwards. The <HI>Compages</HI> of the Upper Earth, and of its <HI>Strata</HI>, became thereby chap'd, broken and divided, and &s;o carried up the warm Steams from beneath, to particular Recep|tacles and <HI>Volcano</HI>'s, which before &s;erv'd in a more equal and uniform manner to heat and invigorate the entire Earth and its Productions. The Tides, la&s;tly, became frequenter, and &s;o more &s;udden and violent than before. Which &s;hort Summary or Scheme of the States of Nature in our Hypo|the&s;is before and after the Fall, ought to be all along born in mind, and reflected on, in order to the pa&s;&s;ing a right Judgment on the Accounts of tho&s;e Phaenomena, in the Solution whereof we are now engag'd: And which otherwi&s;e might &s;eem very odd and unaccountable to the Reader.

<Q>XXIX. The <HI>Primitive</HI> Earth was not equally Paradi|&s;iacal all over. The Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> or Paradi&s;e being a peculiarly fruitful and happy Soil, and par|ticularly furni&s;h'd with the Nece&s;&s;aries and Delights of an innocent and ble&s;&s;ed Life, above the other Regions of the Earth.</Q>
<P N="29">XXIX. That all the <HI>Primitive</HI> Earth could not be equally Paradi&s;iacal, and enjoy the &s;ame Pri|vileges and Conveniences beyond the pre&s;ent, is ea&s;ily prov'd. For &s;eeing one of its princi|pal Cau&s;es of Fertility, and other Prerogatives, was the greater Degree of Heat at the Paradi&s;iacal Regions; The Climates near the Solar Cour&s;e being alone capable of &s;uch greater Heat, mu&s;t be alone capable of its Effects al&s;o; and con&s;e|quently, we are to confine our Enquiries for the Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> to the Countries not very remote from the Ancient Ecliptick. Now that
<PB N="356" REF="462">
&s;ome peculiar Spot or Region thereabouts might beyond all the re&s;t, be Fertile, Plea&s;ant and Pa|radi&s;iacal, 'tis not difficult to &s;uppo&s;e. At the pre&s;ent there is a mighty Variety in Countries in the very &s;ame Hemi&s;phere, Climate, and Paral|lel. The particular Prerogatives of one Region beyond another do not entirely depend on the Sun, or the Vicinage of the Central Heat: But partly on the Nature and Temper of the Soil; the Kinds of Vegetables and Fo&s;&s;ils thereto be|longing; the number, qualities, and conflux of Rivers; the Firmne&s;s or Loo&s;ene&s;s of the <HI>Inferior Strata</HI>, hindring, or freelier permitting the a&s;cent of the Subterraneous Steams, Juices, and <HI>Effluvia</HI>: From the Coincidence of which, and of other &s;uch things, in a peculiar and advantagious manner, order'd and di&s;pos'd on purpo&s;e by the Divine Providence at the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Creation, the extraor|dinary Plea&s;antne&s;s and Felicity of this Earthly Paradi&s;e, or Garden of Plea&s;ure, is, I &s;uppo&s;e to be deduc'd; and which being con&s;idered, will, I believe, be &s;ufficient to give Satisfaction in the Propo&s;ition before us.</P>
<Q>XXX. The ancient Paradi&s;e or Garden of <HI>Eden</HI>, the Seat of our fir&s;t Parents in the State of Innocence, was a|bout the <HI>North-We&s;t</HI> Bounds of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI>, at the River <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates</HI>; (for their <HI>Antediluvian</HI> &s;treams &s;eem to have been united before they were come &s;o far as <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI>:) a little below which place they were parted into four branches, and &s;o ran into the great <HI>Southern</HI> Ocean call'd by the Ancients the <HI>Red Sea</HI>, at four Outlets at no &s;mall di&s;tance from one another.</Q>
<P N="30"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hypoth. 4. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE>XXX. This Situation of Paradi&s;e has been already con&s;ider'd, and need not here be rea&s;|&s;um'd.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. A Solution of the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> relating to the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> State of the Earth.</HEAD>
<Q>XXXV. The Inhabitants of the Earth were before the Flood va&s;tly more numerous than the pre&s;ent Earth either actually does, or perhaps is capable to main|tain and &s;upply.</Q>
<P N="35">XXXV. THIS Propo&s;ition will not appear &s;trange, if we con&s;ider, (1.) The much greater fertility of the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Earth, to be pre&s;ently accounted for; whereby it was ca|pable of maintaining a much greater number of In|habitants than the pre&s;ent, even on the &s;ame &s;pace of Ground. (2.) The Earth was more equally
<PB N="359" REF="465">
habitable all over before, than &s;ince the Deluge. For before the Acqui&s;ition of tho&s;e heterogene|ous Mixtures, which the Deluge occa&s;ion'd, and which I take to be the Cau&s;es of all our violent and pernicious Heat and Cold in the <HI>Torrid</HI> and <HI>Frigid Zones</HI> of our Earth; 'tis probable the Earth was pretty equally habitable all over, by rea&s;on of the &s;omewhat greater Vicinage of the Central Heat to the <HI>Polar</HI> Regions, and the more direct Expo&s;ing of the middle Regions to that of the <HI>Sun</HI>. I do not mean that the <HI>Frigid Zones</HI> were equally hot with the <HI>Torrid</HI>; but that the Heat in the one and the Cold in the other, were more kindly; and the exce&s;&s;es of each much le&s;s con&s;i|derable than at pre&s;ent, &s;ince the Introduction of the before-mention'd Mixtures, and particularly of &s;uch Sulphureous and Nitrous <HI>Effluvia</HI>, as are now, I believe, become Calorifick and Frigorifick Particles in our Air, the main occa&s;ions of the vio|lence and pernicious Qualities of the Heat and Cold thereof, and the mo&s;t affecting to our Sen&s;es of all other. So that 'tis probable, before the Acqui&s;ition of the&s;e <HI>Adventitious</HI> Ma&s;&s;es, the Antediluvian Air was every where &s;ufficiently temperate to permit the comfortable Habitation of Mankind on all parts of the Globe; and the Antediluvian Earth was by con&s;equence capable of many more Inhabitants than the pre&s;ent is, or can be; as every one will readily grant, who con&s;iders how few Inhabitants, in compari&s;on, three of the five Zones of our pre&s;ent Earth do maintain. (3.) The dry Land or habitable Earth it &s;elf was, by rea&s;on of the ab&s;ence of the entire Ocean, almo&s;t as large and capacious again as the pre&s;ent: For the Ocean, I think, takes up now at the lea&s;t one half of the entire Globe; but then afforded as large, &s;pacious, and habitable
<PB N="360" REF="466">
Countries, as the other Parts of the Earth. (4.) The Mountains which are now generally bare and barren, were before the Deluge, &s;o far as they were &s;upply'd with Water, as fruitful as the Plains or Vallies; and by rea&s;on of a larger Surface, were capable of maintaining rather more Animals than the Plains on which they &s;tand, would otherwi&s;e have been: The pre&s;ent defect of a fruitful Soil being owing to the De|luge; and there being no good rea&s;on, that I know of, to be a&s;&s;ign'd why, on a primary For|mation, and in a calm and &s;till State of the Air, the higher Parts of the Earth &s;hould not be co|ver'd with a fruitful Soil or Mold, as well as the level or lower adjoining to them. All which Accounts taken together, will, I think, give &s;ome rea&s;onable account of &s;uch va&s;t numbers of Inha|bitants, as according to the Computation of this Propo&s;ition, the Antediluvian World was reple|ni&s;h'd withal.</P>
<P>Corollary 1. <HI>Since by very rea&s;onable Computations of the numbers of the Inhabitants of the Earth at the Deluge, according to the</HI> Hebrew <HI>or</HI> Samaritan <HI>Chrono|logy, they appear to have been &s;ufficient abundantly to repleni&s;h the entire Globe, and full as many as in rea|&s;on the &s;ame could &s;u&s;tain; The</HI> Septuagints <HI>Addi|tion of &s;ix or &s;even hundred Years in this Period of the World to the other Accounts, is &s;o far from clearing Difficulties thereto relating, that it great|ly increa&s;es the &s;ame, and implies rather the allow|ance of more Inhabitants at the Deluge, than we can at all tell where they could live and be main|tain'd</HI>.</P>
<P>Coroll. 2. <HI>Since according to the old</HI> Hebrew <HI>or</HI> Samaritan <HI>Chronology from the Deluge till the time of</HI> Abraham'<HI>s going into</HI> Canaan, <HI>was the entire &s;pace of</HI> 966&frac12; <HI>Years, and the Lives of Men during that in|terval
<PB N="361" REF="467">
were in a mean three hundred Years long; 'tis ea&s;y on the Grounds proceeded upon in this</HI> Phaeno|menon's <HI>Calculations to prove, That there is no need to recede from that Account, to produce the greate&s;t Numbers of Men which in that, or the im|mediately &s;ucceeding Ages, any Authentick Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Ancient Times do require us to &s;uppo&s;e,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Chro|nol.

<P>Coroll. 4. <HI>Seeing it appears, That Mankind has had a gradual Increa&s;e, and that in le&s;s than Five Thou&s;and Years, our Continent of</HI> Europe, A&s;ia, <HI>and</HI> Africa, <HI>has been &s;o entirely Peopled from the Sons of</HI> Noah; <HI>and &s;eeing withal</HI> America <HI>is much le&s;s in Extent, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, generally &s;peak|ing, was never &s;o full of People: In ca&s;e we &s;uppo&s;e that Famines, Wars, Pe&s;tilences, and all &s;uch &s;ad De&s;troyers of Mankind have equally afflicted the &s;e|veral Continents of the Earth; &s;ome light might be afforded to the Peopling of</HI> America, <HI>and about what Age &s;ince the Deluge, the</HI> Americans <HI>pa&s;t fir&s;t from this Continent thither, if they did &s;o pa&s;s; which a more nice Enquiry into the Particulars here to be con|&s;ider'd might a&s;&s;i&s;t us in</HI>.</P>

<P>Corollary. <HI>Hence ari&s;es a &s;trong Confirmation of what is on other Grounds already a&s;&s;erted, That there were only &s;maller Lakes and Seas, but no great Ocean before the Deluge. For &s;ince it ap|pears by this Phaenomenon, that the Waters of the Antediluvian Earth were much more reple|ni&s;h'd, nay, crouded with Fi&s;h than now they are; and &s;ince there was no general De&s;truction of them, as there was of the dry-Land Animals at the Deluge; had there been as great a Compa&s;s, or as va&s;t an Ocean for their Reception then, as at pre&s;ent there is, the numbers now in every part of the Ocean or Seas, ought to be va&s;tly greater than they then were, as being all the Off-&s;pring of tho&s;e which every where &s;urviv'd the Deluge, and which have propagated them&s;elves for much more than four thou&s;and Years &s;ince the &s;ame; which being di&s;a|greeable to the Ob&s;ervations referr'd to in this Phaenomenon, is little le&s;s than a Demon&s;tration of the Fal&s;hood of that Hypothe&s;is on which 'tis built, or a full Atte&s;tation to our A&s;&s;ertion, that

<Q>XXXVII. the Antediluvian Earth was much more fruitful than the pre&s;ent; and the multitude of its vegetable Productions much greater.</Q>
<P N="37">XXXVII. Before I come directly to &s;olve this and the following Propo&s;itions, I mu&s;t premi&s;e, that 'tis u&s;ually unrea&s;onable to ask, why &s;uch Phaenomena belong'd to the Antediluvian World: They being commonly but the natural and re|gular Properties of an Original Earth, newly form'd out of a <HI>Chaos</HI>; &s;uch as one &s;hould ratio|nally expect in a World newly come out of the Hands of its Creator, and fitted for the Conve|nience and Fruition of noble Creatures; &s;uch as the generality of our fellow Planets, (e&s;pecially our next Neighbour, the Moon) as far as we can ob&s;erve, appear to have had at fir&s;t, and hi|therto retain'd. All that can in rea&s;on be de&s;ir'd, is this, To give a plain and intelligible Account of tho&s;e oppo&s;ite <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Earth, which we <HI>now</HI> are &s;en&s;ible of, and by what means the Deluge could occa&s;ion the &s;ame. Which there|fore &s;hall be frequently the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;uc|ceeding Solutions. And as to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the decrea&s;e of the fertility of the Earth at the Deluge, the&s;e Cau&s;es are a&s;&s;ignable: (1.) The decrea&s;e of the Sun's Heat by the greater di|&s;tance of the Earth from him &s;ince, than before the Deluge. It has been before prov'd, that till the Deluge, the Earth's Orbit was Circular, and the <HI>Radius</HI> of that Circle in a manner the &s;ame with the neare&s;t di&s;tance at the <HI>Perihelion</HI> now: So that &s;ince the Heat of the Sun is as the Den&s;ity of his Rays, or at lea&s;t <HI>reciprocally</HI> as the Squares of the Earth's di&s;tance from him: If in&s;tead of the pre&s;ent <HI>Ellip&s;is</HI> we take for Calculations &s;ake,
<PB N="364" REF="470">
as we ought, a Circle, in the middle between the neare&s;t and farthe&s;t di&s;tance, we &s;hall find that the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Heat on the Earth in general be|fore the Deluge, was to its pre&s;ent Heat, as al|mo&s;t a hundred to ninety &s;ix, or a twenty fifth part of his entire Heat greater before than &s;ince the &s;ame, which is by no means incon&s;iderable in the Ca&s;e before us. (2.) The Heat of the Central Body was con&s;iderably damp'd and ob|&s;tructed, both by the Waters of the Deluge them&s;elves, acquir'd from abroad, and now con|tain'd in the Pores and Caverns of the Earth under us; and by that Sediment of them which now compo&s;es that upper Cru&s;t of Earth we dwell upon, and which being &s;ettled and con&s;olidated on the Superficies of the ancient Earth, would prove a great Hindrance to the a&s;cending Steams, not to be overcome but by Degrees, and in length of time afterwards. From both which Cau&s;es a very notable Damp would be put to the Influence of the Central Heat, on which, as well as on the <HI>Sun</HI>'s, the Fertility of every Soil &s;eems in part to depend. (3.) The upper Earth, or fruitful Soil it &s;elf, the main Fund and Promptu|ary of the vegetable Kingdom, is now very incon|&s;iderable in quantity, if compar'd with that of the Primitive or Antediluvian Earth. For &s;ince this la&s;t mention'd was the entire product of the An|cient <HI>Chaos</HI>, at the Original Formation of the Earth; and the fir&s;t, what only was afforded from a &s;mall part of &s;uch a <HI>Chaos</HI>, or of the Comet's <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI>, and by the Storms born off the Tops of Mountains at and after the Deluge, while the old Soil lies buried under the Sediment or Cru&s;t on which we live; 'tis no wonder that our fertile <HI>Stra|tum</HI> is now thinner &s;pread, and &s;o the Productions le&s;s copious in the pre&s;ent, than they were in the
<PB N="365" REF="471">
Antediluvian State of Things. And this, tho' we &s;uppo&s;e the Soil from the Comet, or from the Tops of the Mountains, to be as good in it &s;elf, and to have remain'd as pure and unmix'd with any heterogeneous Matter in this Confu&s;ion of things at the Deluge, as it would at the regular Formation of the Earth at fir&s;t; which yet is by no means &s;uppo&s;able; and the contrary to which being allow'd for, will &s;till farther afford us a rea&s;on of the pre&s;ent A&s;&s;ertion. So that &s;ince the pre&s;ent Soil is both much wor&s;e in Quality, and much le&s;s in Quantity than the old one; and &s;ince the Heat, whether of the Sun or Central Solid is &s;o much le&s;&s;en'd at the Deluge, which things include the main Cau&s;es of Fertility; 'tis no wonder that the pre&s;ent Earth is nothing near &s;o fruitful and luxuriant in her Productions, as the Antediluvian was.</P>
<Q>XXXVIII. The Temperature of the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Air was more equable as to its different Climates, and its different Sea&s;ons; without &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive and &s;udden heat and cold; without the &s;corching of a <HI>Torrid Zone</HI>, and of burning Summers; or the freezing of the <HI>Frigid Zones</HI>, and of piercing Winters; and without &s;uch &s;udden and violent Changes in the Cli|mates or Sea&s;ons from one Extreme to another, as the pre&s;ent Air, to our Sorrow, is &s;ubject to.</Q>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. Seeing the primary State here men|tion'd, is but a proper re&s;ult from the fir&s;t For|mation of the Earth; all that need be accounted for, is the Alteration at the Deluge. (1.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See al&s;o</HI> Philo&s;. Tran&s;act. <HI>No.</HI> 203. <HI>p.</HI> 879, 880.</NOTE>) The mighty difference of Climates, e&s;pecially of the <HI>Torrid</HI> and <HI>Frigid Zones</HI>, is, I &s;uppo&s;e, owing not only to the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Heat, or the Nature of the Air it &s;elf, but partly to tho&s;e Calorifick and Frigorifick Mixtures, which are uncertainly con|tain'd therein. Meer Heat and Cold are very different things from that Pothery and Sultry, that Fro&s;ty and Congealing Weather, which al|ternately
<PB N="366" REF="472">
in Summer and Winter, at the Line and the Poles we u&s;ually now feel. The&s;e Effects &s;eem plainly deriv'd from Nitrous or Sulphu|reous, or other the like Steams exhaled into, mix'd with, and &s;u&s;tained by that thick and gro&s;s Atmo&s;phere which now encompa&s;&s;es the Earth. All which I mean as well the gro&s;s At|mo&s;phere it &s;elf, as tho&s;e its Heterogeneous Mix|tures, are a very natural Off-&s;pring of the De|luge, according to the pre&s;ent Account thereof. For &s;eeing we at that time pa&s;s'd clear through the <HI>Chaotick Atmo&s;phere</HI> of a Comet, we mu&s;t needs bear off, and acquire va&s;t quantities of &s;uch heterogeneous and indige&s;ted Ma&s;&s;es, as our Air now contains in it; whence tho&s;e Effects here mention'd would naturally proceed. 'Tis proba|ble the original Air was too pure, rare, and thin, to &s;u&s;tain any gro&s;s and earthy Particles, tho' they had been left in it at the fir&s;t, and &s;o its Heat both for kind and degree, was no other than the proper Place and Influence of the Sun could re|quire: And 'twas then &s;ure more uniform through the &s;everal Climates of the Earth than <HI>now</HI> it is; when our Air in the <HI>Torrid Zone</HI>, being full of Sulphureous and Sultry, and in the <HI>Frigid</HI> ones of Nitrous and freezing <HI>Effluvia</HI> or Exhalations, the violence of an unkindly Heat in the one, and of the like unkindly Cold in the other, are &s;o &s;en&s;ible, and &s;o pernicious, as all Experience atte&s;ts them now to be. (2.) The uncertainty of our Sea&s;ons, with the &s;udden and unexpected changes in the Temper of our Air, are on the &s;ame Accounts equally vi&s;ible with the for|mer. For the Temper of the Air &s;ince the De|luge, e&s;pecially with regard to our Sen&s;ations, not re&s;ulting from the external Heat only, but from the Kinds and Quantities of its heterogeneous
<PB N="367" REF="473">
and adventitious Mixtures, will not now depend on the Sea&s;on of the Year alone, but on the veering of the Wind, and its uncertain removal of the Air with its Steams from one Region to another. Thus if in <HI>Summer</HI> the <HI>North</HI> Wind chance to blow any long time together, 'twill bring along with the Air &s;o great Quantities of the Cold, Freezing, Nitrous Steams, as may quite overcome the <HI>Sun</HI>'s Heat, and cau&s;e a very cold Sea&s;on of a &s;udden; if the <HI>South</HI> Wind do the like in the <HI>Winter</HI>, the contrary Effect will follow, and we &s;hall have a warm Sea&s;on when Fro&s;t and Snow were more naturally to be ex|pected. Thus, accordingly, frequent experi|ence &s;hews the <HI>Sun</HI> to be &s;o little Ma&s;ter of the Sea&s;ons of the Year, that &s;ometimes <HI>January</HI> and <HI>July</HI> for &s;everal Days are hardly di&s;tingui&s;hable. It &s;ometimes happens, that we have this Day a Fro&s;t, the next proves &s;o warm, that the former Cold is forgotten, till perhaps the &s;ucceeding Night puts us more affectingly in mind of it again. Nay, in a very few Hours &s;pace a &s;ultry and a freezing Air not &s;eldom do &s;ucceed each other, to the great harm and mi&s;ery of Mankind, and of all their fellow Animals in our pre&s;ent State; from which certainly we have good rea|&s;on to believe our happier Progenitors before the Deluge were entirely free. (3.) That our Sea|&s;ons are &s;o extreme in their &s;everal Kinds, is ea|&s;y to be hence accounted for al&s;o. For were there no &s;ulphureous or calorifick Steams in the Air, all pothery and &s;ultry Weather, and &s;uch &s;ort of Heat as chiefly affects our Bodies&punc; would be quite avoided, and the great increa&s;e thereof after the <HI>Summer Sol&s;tice</HI>, which ari&s;es, 'tis probable, in part from the Airs retention of one Day's Heat, till the next augments it again, would in good
<PB N="368" REF="474">
mea&s;ure cea&s;e among us. And the like is to be &s;aid of the Cold in <HI>Winter</HI>, in all the re&s;pects be|fore mention'd. The Original of all which Ef|fects being &s;o ea&s;ily deducible from the pre&s;ent Account of the Deluge, 'tis no que&s;tion but the Antediluvians might to their comfort, be wholly Strangers to them. Their Climates were not of &s;o very different Temper; their Sea&s;ons lei&s;urely and gradual, entirely following the Solar Cour&s;e; and their Summers and Winters not &s;o mighty different; at the mo&s;t in the &s;ingle Proportion of the Sun's Pre&s;ence or Ab&s;ence, Direct or Ob|lique Situation. In this equable State the <HI>Polar</HI> Inhabitants might with little danger cut the <HI>Line</HI>, and the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> vi&s;it the <HI>Frigid Zone</HI>. In this condition of the World, the peculiar Air of eve|ry Country went not far from home, to di&s;turb that of others: A few days never made any &s;en&s;ible Alteration in the temperature of the Air; and all that entire <HI>Spring</HI> or <HI>Autumn</HI> could do, would &s;till leave the &s;ame pretty equable; to be &s;ure very tolerable. On all which, and &s;everal other con&s;equential Accounts, we have but too much rea&s;on to envy the Ancient Happine&s;s of our Forefathers, and to be &s;en&s;ible of that fatal and de&s;tructive Cata&s;trophe, which the Wicked|ne&s;s of Mankind brought upon them&s;elves, and all their Po&s;terity to this very Day, at the Deluge we are now &s;peaking of.</P>
<Q>XXXIX. The Con&s;titution of the <HI>Antediluvian</HI> Air was Thin, Pure, Subtile and Homogeneous; without &s;uch gro&s;s Steams, Exhalations, Nitro&s;ulphureous, or other Heterogeneous Mixtures, as occa&s;ion Co|ru&s;cations, Meteors, Thunder, Lightning, with Contagious, and Pe&s;tilential Infections, in our pre|&s;ent Air; and have &s;o very pernicious and fatal (tho' &s;ometimes almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible) effects in the World &s;ince the Deluge.</Q>
<P N="39"><PB N="369" REF="475">XXXIX. The Con&s;ideration of the foregoing <HI>Solution</HI> is &s;ufficient to clear the pre&s;ent Phaeno|menon al&s;o; to which therefore the <HI>Reader</HI> is re|ferr'd.</P>
<Q>XL. The Antediluvian Air had no large, gro&s;s Ma&s;|&s;es of Vapours, or Clouds, hanging for long &s;ea&s;ons in the &s;ame. It had no great round Drops of Rain&punc; de&s;cending in Multitudes together, which we call Showers: But the Ground was watered by gentle Mi&s;ts or Vapours a&s;cending in the Day, and de&s;cend|ing, in great mea&s;ure, again in the &s;ucceeding Night.</Q>
<P N="40">XL. This is al&s;o ea&s;ily under&s;tood from what has been already &s;aid. So rare, thin, pure, and &s;ubtile an Air as the Antediluvian was, would &s;carce &s;u&s;tain &s;uch gro&s;s and heavy Ma&s;&s;es, as the Clouds are: It would not precipitate the <HI>Su|perior</HI> Vapours upon the <HI>Inferior</HI> in &s;uch Quanti|ties, and with &s;uch Violence, as is nece&s;&s;ary to the Production of great round &s;en&s;ible Drops of Rain: It had no gro&s;s Steams to retain Heat af|ter the Cau&s;e of it was gone, and the Sun &s;et; and &s;o the Vapours which were rais'd in the Day, would de&s;cend again in the Night with the great|e&s;t Regularity and Gentlene&s;s. In all which re|&s;pects the different Nature, Cra&s;&s;itude, and irre|gular Compo&s;ition of our pre&s;ent gro&s;s <HI>Atmo|&s;phere</HI>, acquir'd at the Deluge from the Comet's, in which &s;uch Opake Ma&s;&s;es as the Clouds, are frequently to be ob&s;erv'd, mu&s;t naturally admit and require tho&s;e contrary Effects, which the pre&s;ent Propo&s;ition takes notice of, and were to be here accounted for.</P>
<Q>XLI. The Antediluvian Air was free from violent Winds, Storms, and Agitations, with all their Ef|fects on the Earth or Seas, which we cannot now but be &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of.</Q>
<P N="41">XLI. The&s;e <HI>Phaenomena</HI> are &s;uch proper Con|&s;equents

of a Primitive Formation, and the O|riginal of tho&s;e oppo&s;ite ones ever &s;ince the De|luge &s;o naturally thence to be deriv'd, that there is no rea&s;on to imagine them to have been before. A Comet's <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> is a very <HI>&s;tormy Fluid</HI>, where|in Ma&s;&s;es of Opake Matter are continually hurried about, all manner of ways, in a very uncertain and&punc; violent manner. Seeing therefore we acquir'd at the Deluge &s;o great a Quantity of the &s;ame Atmo&s;phere, of which ours is now in part compos'd, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to expect any o|ther State of things than &s;uch as this Phaeno|menon mentions, and was to be here accounted for.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. iii.8. Marg.</NOTE>Corollary. <HI>Hence it appears, That the</HI> Wind of the Day, <HI>of which</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>makes mention at the Fall of Man, if it was con&s;iderable, was not a con&s;tant</HI> Phaenomenon <HI>of the Earth, but peculiar to that time. And this is very agreeable to the</HI> Hypothe&s;is <HI>before laid down of the commencement of the</HI> Diurnal Ro|tation <HI>at the very day here mention'd; according to which a Wind mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e at that point of Time, tho' there were none before or after, till the Deluge. On that beginning of the</HI> Diurnal Rotati|on, (1.) <HI>The</HI> Equatorial <HI>Regions would be eleva|ted, the</HI> Polar <HI>depre&s;s'd, the</HI> Orb <HI>of Earth would be chap'd and broken, and warm Steams bur&s;t out at the Fi&s;&s;ures thereby produc'd; all which could &s;carce hap|pen without &s;ome Agitation of the Air. But</HI>, (2.) <HI>What is more certain and more con&s;iderable, when the</HI> Terraqueous Globe <HI>began on a &s;udden to revolve from</HI> We&s;t <HI>to</HI> Ea&s;t, <HI>the Air could not pre|&s;ently accompany it, and &s;o mu&s;t cau&s;e a Wind from</HI> Ea&s;t <HI>to</HI> We&s;t; <HI>till receiving by degrees the Im|pre&s;&s;ion, it kept at la&s;t equal pace therewith, and re&s;ting re&s;pectively, cau&s;ed a con&s;tant Calm after|wards. Which Wind being therefore (from the
<PB N="371" REF="477">
Earth</HI>'s <HI>Velocity there) greate&s;t towards the Equator and Tropicks, near the latter of which was the Place of Paradi&s;e, would be con&s;iderable enough, e&s;pecially in a State otherwi&s;e &s;till and calm, to be taken notice of by the &s;acred Hi&s;tory; and be a kind of Relick or Foot&s;tep of the then Commencement of that</HI> Di|urnal Rotation, <HI>which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to account for it, and has been from other Arguments already prov'd in its proper Place</HI>.</P>
<Q>XLII. The Antediluvian Air had no <HI>Rain-Bow</HI>; as the pre&s;ent &s;o frequently has.</Q>
<P N="42">XLII. This is ea&s;ily accountable from what has been already &s;aid. For, (1.) The de&s;cent of the Vapours nece&s;&s;ary to it was u&s;ually, if not only in the Night, when the ab&s;ence of the Sun rendred its appearance impo&s;&s;ible. (2.) The de|&s;cending Vapours compos'd only a gentle Mi&s;t, not &s;en&s;ible round Drops of Rain, as we have before &s;een, on which yet the Rain-Bow entirely depends; as tho&s;e who under&s;tand the Nature and Generation thereof will ea&s;ily confe&s;s. So that tho' the Sun were above the Horizon at the fall of the Vapours, the appearance of the Rain-Bow was not to be expected. (3.) Were the Va|pours that fell compos'd of &s;en&s;ible round Drops, and fell in the Day-time, and this in &s;ufficient Quantities, yet for want of a Wind which might drive them together on one &s;ide, and thereby clear the Air on the other, for the free admi&s;&s;ion of the Rays of Light, a Rain-Bow were &s;eldom or never to be &s;uppos'd before the Deluge; all which Circum&s;tances being now quite otherwi&s;e, give us clear rea&s;ons for the pre&s;ent frequent ap|pearance of that beautiful and remarkable Phae|nomenon, tho' till the Deluge, it was a perfect Stranger to the World.</P>
<Q><PB N="372" REF="478">XLIII. The <HI>Antediluvians</HI> might only eat Vegetables; but the U&s;e of Fle&s;h after the Flood was freely al|low'd al&s;o.</Q>
<P N="43">XLIII. That a State of Nature as to the Air, Earth, Fruits, and other Circum&s;tances &s;o very different from ours at pre&s;ent, &s;hould require a &s;uitable Difference in the Food and Su&s;tenance of Mankind, is very rea&s;onable to believe. But be&s;ides, (1.) When the Lives of Animals were naturally &s;o long, (as in Corre|&s;pondence to Mankind is fairly to be &s;uppos'd,) before the Deluge; 'tis not improbable that God Almighty would not permit them to be taken away on any other Occa&s;ion than that of Sacrifice or Oblation to him&s;elf. (2.) Perhaps in the tender and even Condition of the Ante|diluvians, the eating of Fle&s;h would have &s;poil'd their Tempers, and &s;hortned their Lives; &s;uch Food being, I &s;uppo&s;e, fitter for our gro&s;s and &s;horter-liv'd State &s;ince the Flood, than that refin'd and la&s;ting one before it. (3.) Per|haps the Antediluvian Vegetables were more juicy, nouri&s;hing, and whole&s;ome, not only than Fle&s;h, but than them&s;elves have &s;ince been; which the better and more fertile Soil out of which they grew then, gives &s;ome rea&s;on to conjecture. And whether they had not then &s;ome Vegetables which we have not now, may de&s;erve the Con&s;ideration of &s;uch as &s;earch after their remains in the Bowels of the Earth: The &s;ame care of the Vegetable, as of the Animal Kingdom not appearing in the Sa|cred Hi&s;tory relating to the Deluge. However, (4.) If we ob&s;erve that even at this Day, the warm Sea&s;ons and Countries are le&s;s di&s;pos'd to the eating of Fle&s;h than the cold ones; and re|member that the Antediluvian Air was in &s;ome

<Q>XLIV. The Lives of the <HI>Antediluvians</HI> were more u|niver&s;ally equal, and va&s;tly longer than ours now are: Men before the Flood frequently approaching near to a thou&s;and, which almo&s;t none now do to a hundred Years of Age.</Q>
<P N="44">XLIV. Tho' &s;everal other things might here de&s;erve to be con&s;ider'd, yet I &s;hall only in&s;i&s;t upon the difference between the Antediluvian Air, and that &s;ince the Flood, to give an Ac|count of this Propo&s;ition. The Con&s;ideration of the Pure, Unmixed, Equable, and Gentle Con&s;titution of the former; compar'd with the Gro&s;s, Thick, Heterogeneous, Mutable, and Vio|lent Condition of the latter, of it &s;elf affording a &s;ufficient Solution of this Difficulty. That Air which is drawn in every Breath; who&s;e inclu|ded Particles, 'tis probable, in&s;inuate them&s;elves continually into our Blood, and the other Fluids of our Bodies, and on which all Experience &s;hews human Life and Health exceedingly to depend; being at the Deluge chang'd from a Rare and Thin, to a Thick and Gro&s;s Con&s;i&s;t|ence; from an equability or gradual and gentle warmth and coolne&s;s of Temperature, to ex|tremity of Heat and Cold; and that with the mo&s;t &s;udden and irregular &s;teps from one to another: From True and Pure Air, or an Ho|mogeneous Ela&s;tical Fluid, to a mix'd and con|fu&s;ed <HI>Compo&s;itum</HI> or Atmo&s;phere, wherein all &s;orts of <HI>Effluvia</HI>, Sulphureous, Nitrous, Mineral and Metallick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are contain'd.

What Effect in Point of Life and Health &s;uch a Change mu&s;t have on the Per&s;on before-mention'd, 'tis not difficult to imagine: And as ea&s;y, on a like compari&s;on of the <HI>Antediluvian Aether</HI>, and the pre&s;ent <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI>, to account for the Pro|po&s;ition before us; and &s;hew as well why Men dye at all uncertain Periods of Years, and have, while they live, a precarious State of Health, with frequent Sickne&s;&s;es; as why none reach any whit near the long Ages of tho&s;e that before the Deluge continu'd in Health and Security for near a thou&s;and Years together.</P>

Which Vapours would be impeded from de&s;cending towards the Sun, by the Earth's In|terpo&s;ition and Reception of the &s;ame, and by the attractive Power of the Earth it &s;elf withal, and &s;o would fall down with great Violence up|on its Surface. A great part of which being in a very Rare and Expanded Condition, after their Primary Fall, would be immediately mounted upward into the Air, and afterward de&s;cend in violent and outragious Rains upon the Face of the Earth. All tho&s;e Vapours which were rarer and lighter than that Air which is immediately contiguous to the Earth, mu&s;t certainly a&s;cend to &s;uch a height therein, where its Den&s;ity and Specifick Gravity were corre&s;pondent (as far as that Croud of their fellow Vapours, with which the Air was oppre&s;s'd, would give leave;) and &s;o afterwards, as they cool'd, thicken'd, and were collected together, like our pre&s;ent Vapours mu&s;t de&s;cend in mo&s;t prodigious Showers of Rain for a long time afterwards, and very naturally occa|&s;ion that forty Days and forty Nights Rain men|tion'd in the Propo&s;ition before us.

<P N="48">XLVIII. This va&s;t Quantity of Waters was not de|riv'd from the Earth or Seas, as Rains con&s;tantly now are; but from &s;ome other Superior and Cele|&s;tial Original.</P>

<P N="49">XLIX.

<P N="50"><PB N="380" REF="486">L.

<P N="50"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. 85, 86. pri&ugrave;s. Fig. 7.</NOTE>L. This has in part been explain'd in the <HI>Lemmata</HI> hereto relating; and will be more fully under&s;tood from the Figure there al&s;o referr'd to. For let adbc repre&s;ent the Earth, moving along the Ecliptick GH, from G towards H. 'Tis evident that the Figure of the Earth before the approach of the Comet, as far as 'tis here con|cern'd, was Spherical. But now, let us &s;uppo&s;e the Comet bi Dh (as it was de&s;cending towards its <HI>Perihelion</HI>, along its <HI>Trajectory</HI> EF, from E towards F) to approach very near, and arrive at the neare&s;t Po&s;ition, repre&s;ented in the Figure. 'Tis evident that this Pre&s;ence of the Comet would cau&s;e a double Tide, as well in the Seas above, as in the Aby&s;s below. That in the Seas being le&s;s con&s;iderable in it &s;elf, and not to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, need not be taken any farther notice of: But the other would be va&s;tly great, (&s;uppo&s;e 5 or 6 Miles high above its former Po|&s;ition) would produce mighty Effects on the Orb above it, and &s;o de&s;erves a nicer Con&s;ideration in this place. As &s;oon therefore as the Comet came pretty near, (as &s;uppo&s;e within the <HI>Moon's</HI> di&s;tance,) this double Tide would begin to ri&s;e, and increa&s;e all the time of its approach, till the Comet was neare&s;t of all, as in the Figure. And then or rather a little after, the&s;e Tides, or dou|ble Protuberances of the Aby&s;s, would be at their utmo&s;t height. So that the Surface of the Aby&s;s, and of its incumbent Orb of Earth, would put
<PB N="381" REF="487">
on that <HI>Elliptick</HI>, or rather truly and exactly O|val Figure, under which 'tis here repre&s;ented.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. 85. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> Now, 'tis certain, that this Spheroid Surface of the Aby&s;s is larger than its former Spherical one; 'tis al&s;o certain, that the Orb of Earth which re&s;t|ed on this Aby&s;s mu&s;t be oblig'd to follow its Fi|gure, and accommodate it &s;elf to this large <HI>Oval</HI>; which being impo&s;&s;ible for it to do while it re|main'd &s;olid, continu'd, and conjoin'd, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity enlarge it &s;elf, and by the violent force of the increa&s;ing Surface of the Aby&s;s be &s;tretch'd, crack'd, broken, and have innumerable Fi&s;&s;ures made quite through it, from the upper to the under Surface thereof, nearly perpendicular to the &s;ame Surfaces; or rather the Tide mu&s;t open and enlarge tho&s;e Fi&s;&s;ures which were fir&s;t produc'd at the Commencement of the Diurnal Rotation. So that this Orb of Earth, which originally, in its primary Formation, was Sphe|rical, its inward <HI>Compages</HI> or <HI>Strata</HI> even, con|join'd and continual; which had afterward, at the Commencing of the Diurnal Rotation, been chang'd into an Oblate Spheriod, and at the &s;ame time been thereby in a le&s;s degree broken, chap'd, and disjointed; by that time its wounds had been well healed, and it was in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ettled, and fix'd in &s;uch a Condition, receiv'd this new Di&s;ruption at the Deluge. Its old Fi&s;&s;ures were open'd, and the Fountains of the Aby&s;s (mo&s;t Naturally and Emphatically &s;o &s;til'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. E&s;&s;ay Pa. 121, &amp;c. and Pa. 152.</NOTE> according to Dr. <HI>Woodward</HI>'s Account of the Origin of Fountains) broken up; and &s;ufficient Gaps made for a Communication between the Aby&s;s below, and the Surface of the Earth above the &s;ame, if any occa&s;ion &s;hould be given for the A&s;cent of the former, or De&s;cent of any thing from the latter. And here 'tis to be noted, that the&s;e Chaps and
<PB N="382" REF="488">
Fi&s;&s;ures, though they were never &s;o many or &s;o open, could not of them&s;elves rai&s;e any Subter|raneous Waters, nor contribute one jot to the drowning of the Earth, if the upper Orb had been long ago &s;ettled. and &s;unk as far into the Aby&s;s as the Law of <HI>Hydro&s;taticks</HI> requir'd; and whether 'twere entire or broken, would cau&s;e no new pre&s;&s;ure; and no more than maintain its <HI>prior</HI> Situation on the Face of the Deep. The&s;e <HI>Fi&s;&s;ures</HI> had been in a le&s;s Degree open and ex|tended in their Original Generation, when the Diurnal Rotation began, and was there no re|markable Deluge, and perhaps no Deluge at all: for tho' I &s;uppo&s;e the lower <HI>Strata</HI> of the Earth were con&s;olidated the fir&s;t Day or Year of the Creation, and &s;o upon the de&s;cent of the Terre&s;tri|al Matter could not &s;ink &s;o low as the Law of <HI>Hydro&s;taticks</HI> requir'd, and would therefore upon the original Opening of the Fi&s;&s;ures attempt to rai&s;e the Waters, yet the pre&s;&s;ing of this Quan|tity of Earthy Matter of the &s;econd, and of the Waters too of the third Day, might not be &s;uffici|ent to rai&s;e the Subterraneous Waters high enough, &s;o as to cau&s;e them to i&s;&s;ue out at the very tops of tho&s;e Fi&s;&s;ures. So that tho' this breaking up of the Fountains of the Deep was a prerequi&s;ite Con|dition, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the A&s;cent of the Subterraneous Waters, yet is it not to be e|&s;teem'd the principal cau&s;e or efficient thereof: <HI>That</HI> is to be deriv'd from another original, and is as follows. As &s;oon as the pre&s;ence of the Comet had produc'd tho&s;e va&s;t Tides, or double elevation and depre&s;&s;ion of the Aby&s;s, and there|by disjointed the Earth, and caus'd the before|mention'd patent holes or breaches quite through the Body of it, the Fall of Waters began, and quickly cover'd the Earth, and crouded the Air
<PB N="383" REF="489">
with va&s;t Quantities thereof: Which Waters be|ing adventitious or additional ones, and of a pro|digious Weight withal, mu&s;t pre&s;s downward with a mighty Force, and endeavour to &s;ink the Orb of Earth deeper into the Aby&s;s, according as the entire Weight of each Column of Earth, and its incumbent Water together, agreeably to the Law of <HI>Hydro&s;taticks</HI>, did now require.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. 78, 79. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> And had the Earth at it fir&s;t &s;ub&s;iding into the A|by&s;s, been loo&s;e, &s;eparate, and unfix'd, &s;o as to admit the Aby&s;s between its Parts, and &s;uffer a gentle Sub&s;idence of the Columns of the Earth entirely in the requi&s;ite Proportion, we could &s;carce have expected any elevation of the Sub|terraneous Waters. But &s;ince, as we have often ob&s;erv'd, the lower <HI>Strata</HI> of the Earth were in good mea&s;ure &s;ettled, fa&s;tened, and con&s;olidated together before the upper were all form'd, the whole <HI>Comp$ges</HI> would Archwi&s;e &s;u&s;tain it &s;elf much higher than the Law of Specifick Gravity would otherwi&s;e require; and &s;o upon any Di&s;|ruption of the upper Earth, its &s;everal Columns, as there was room, would &s;ettle them&s;elves lower than they were at fir&s;t, and rai&s;e any Fluid con|tain'd in its Fi&s;&s;ures upwards. And withal the new and va&s;t pre&s;&s;ure of the Additional Waters from the Comet upon the Orb of Earth would certainly force any Fluid towards the Surface, or any way, where&s;oever there were a pa&s;&s;age for it: To which therefore the Breaches, Holes, and Fi&s;&s;ures &s;o newly generated, or rather open|ed afre&s;h by the Violence of the Tides in the A|by&s;s beneath, would be very ready and natural Outlets; through which it would A&s;cend with a mighty force, and carry up before it whatever was in its way, whether Fluid or Solid, whe|ther 'twere Earth or Water. And &s;eeing, as
<PB N="384" REF="490">
we before &s;aw,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Solut. 6. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> the lower Regions of the Earth were full of Water, pervading and repleni&s;hing the Pores and Inter&s;tices thereof; which Waters on the opening of the Fi&s;&s;ures would from all Sides ouze into, and fill up the inferior parts of the &s;ame, and re&s;t on the face of the Aby&s;s; the den&s;e Fluid of the Aby&s;s, in its violent A&s;|cent through the Fi&s;&s;ures, would carry before it, and throw out at the Tops of the &s;aid Fi&s;&s;ures great Quantities of the &s;ame; and if its force were any where &s;ufficient, would ca&s;t it &s;elf al&s;o out at the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ages; and by both or either ways would add to the quantity of the Waters al|ready on the face of the Earth, and become a fre&s;h Augmentation of that Deluge, which be|gan already to overwhelm and de&s;troy the Inha|bitants thereof. For the better Apprehen&s;ion of this Matter, let us imagine the following Expe|riment were made. Suppo&s;e a <HI>Cylinder</HI> of Stone or Marble fitted &s;o exactly to a hollow <HI>Cylindri|cal</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, that it may ju&s;t A&s;cend or De&s;cend freely within it: Let the <HI>Cylinder</HI> of Stone or Marble have &s;mall Holes bored quite through it, parallel to the <HI>Axis</HI> thereof: Let the Ve&s;&s;el be fill'd half full of Water; and the <HI>Cylinder</HI>, as gently as you plea&s;e, be put into the Ve&s;&s;el, till it touch the Water: Let then each of the Holes through the <HI>Cylinder</HI> be fill'd in part with Oyl, or any other Fluid lighter than the Water, to &s;wim upon the Surface thereof: Things being thus provided, you have the very ca&s;e of the Deluge before you; and what Effects you here, in a le&s;&s;er Degree, will ob&s;erve, are but the Re|pre&s;entations of tho&s;e greater and more remark|able ones of which we are now &s;peaking. For as the Weight of the <HI>Cylinder</HI> pre&s;&s;ing upon the Surface of the Water would &s;queeze the

Oil upon its Surface through the Holes, and ca&s;t it out thereat with &s;ome Violence, and ca&s;t it &s;elf too out at the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ages, if the Holes were not too high, in compari&s;on to the Quan|tity of the entire Pre&s;&s;ure upon the Surface of the Water; ju&s;t &s;o the Weight of the Columns of Earth, augmented by the additional Waters of the Comet, would &s;queeze and pre&s;s upon the Surface of the <HI>Aby&s;s</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Newt. p. 290, &amp;c.</NOTE> which being a fluid Ma&s;s and incapable of &s;u&s;taining a Pre&s;&s;ure in one Part, without equally communicating it to all the re&s;t, any way what&s;oever, mu&s;t bur&s;t out where-ever &s;uch Pre&s;&s;ure was wanting, and throw it &s;elf up the <HI>Fi&s;&s;ures</HI>; carrying up before it, and throwing out upon the Earth tho&s;e Waters which, (like Oil on the Water in the Experi|ment) lay upon its Surface, and cover'd the &s;ame; and thereby increa&s;ing the Greatne&s;s of the Deluge, and having a Share in that De|&s;truction which it brought upon the Earth.

&s;o calm, fair, and undi&s;turb'd a Day, as per|mitted their regular and orderly going into the Ark before the Waters overtook them.

<P>Coroll. 2. <HI>Here is an In&s;tance of the peculiar Providence of God in the Pre&s;ervation of the</HI> Ark, <HI>by ordering the Situation of it, &s;o as to e&s;cape the Violence of the Thick Vapours in their fir&s;t precipitate Fall, which otherwi&s;e mu&s;t very probably have da&s;h'd it to pieces; for con&s;idering their Velocity of Motion, which indeed was prodigious, no le&s;s than about twelve hundred Miles in the &s;pace of a Minute, 'tis not ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e, that any Building could &s;u&s;tain and pre|&s;erve it &s;elf under the Violence thereof; which we &s;ee the</HI> Ark, <HI>by the peculiar Place of its Situation, about

<P>Coroll. 3. <HI>Hence 'tis evident, That the place of the</HI> Ark <HI>in</HI> China, <HI>at the beginning of the Deluge, was its true one, and not any Mountain in or near</HI> Armenia, <HI>where at la&s;t it re&s;ted.

<Q>LIII. The Waters of the Deluge increas'd by degrees five Months, till their utmo&s;t Height; and then decreas'd by degrees &s;till longer, till they were clearly gone off the Face of the Earth.</Q>

Nor would the&s;e Streams be &s;topped, till by degrees the Columns of the upper Earth were &s;ettled &s;ufficiently into the den&s;e Fluid, to take off their great Pre&s;&s;ure, which might not be till a long time after the 40 Days Rain was over. This for the gradual Increa&s;e of the Waters: As to their gradual Decrea&s;e, that will be di&s;tinctly treated of hereafter.</P>

For, as to the fir&s;t and principal Rain, it was, to be &s;ure, &s;o con&s;tant, &s;o downright, and &s;o uninterrupted, that no little Commotion in the Air could have place; or if it had, could di&s;turb it, which is commonly the ca&s;e of long and &s;ettled Rains with us at this Day. And as to the &s;ubterraneous Waters, a&s;cending with &s;ome Violence, they were confin'd to &s;everal particular Places, and not uni|ver&s;al; and tho' they might cau&s;e &s;ome Commo|tions at the bottom of the Waters, yet might the Surface of the &s;ame, and the Air, be &s;ufficiently calm and undi&s;turb'd.</P>
<Q>LV. Yet during the latter part of the Deluge, there was a con&s;iderable Wind, if not Storms and Tem|pe&s;ts al&s;o.</Q>
<P N="55">LV. Seeing at the end of the Flood, Storms were to be expected; and &s;eeing yet the <HI>Ark</HI>, which had been afloat &s;o long, and was &s;o &s;till, (the Waters being now at the very highe&s;t) was incapable of abiding a &s;tormy Sea, as we prov'd under the former <HI>Phaenomenon</HI>; there, at fir&s;t view, appears the greate&s;t Danger imaginable, of its peri&s;hing in the future immoderate and extraor|dinary Commotions. And this Danger is increa|&s;ed by this Reflection; that as probably it had been afloat during the mo&s;t part of the 150 Days, while the Waters were gradually and gently aug|menting; &s;o one would imagine ought it to be,

for at lea&s;t as many Days, during the at lea&s;t as gentle and gradual decrea&s;e of the &s;ame afterwards: <HI>i. e.</HI> The Ark ought to have been at lea&s;t &s;o long afloat in the Stormy, as it had been in that Calm part of the Deluge. But this Difficulty, which is to appearance &s;o in&s;oluble, will &s;oon vani&s;h, if we con&s;ider that the Ark re&s;ted upon one of the <HI>Gordy|ean</HI> Mountains, the <HI>then</HI> highe&s;t in the World.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Solu. 61. infra.</NOTE> For &s;eeing the Waters prevailed above the &s;ame Mountain 15 Cubits only,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vii.20.</NOTE> a great part of which Depth of Water would be drawn by the Ark it &s;elf; upon the very fir&s;t cea&s;ing of the ri&s;e of the Waters from the Aby&s;s beneath, which per|mitted the lea&s;t &s;ub&s;iding and diminution of the Deluge, the Ark mu&s;t immediately re&s;t upon the Ground, and thereby &s;ecure it &s;elf from the im|pending Storms. And that accordingly it did &s;o at the time a&s;&s;ign'd, on the Conclu&s;ion of the 150 Days, or the very &s;ame individual Day when the Wind began, is particularly and expre&s;ly ob|&s;erv'd and affirm'd by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>: Which being a very remarkable Coincidence, exactly agreea|ble to the pre&s;ent <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, as well as to the Sa|cred Hi&s;tory, and of very con&s;iderable Impor|tance, I &s;hall &s;et down the Words at large, as follows:</P>
<P><HI>The Waters prevailed upon the Earth an hundred and fifty Days (viz.</HI> from the &s;eventeenth of the &s;econd, to the &s;eventeenth of the &s;eventh Month.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vii. ult. &amp; viii.1, 2, 3, 4.</NOTE>) <HI>And God remembred</HI> Noah, <HI>and every living thing, and all the Cattle that was with him in the Ark: And God made a Wind to pa&s;s over the Earth, and the Waters a&s;&s;waged. The Fountains al&s;o of the deep, and the Windows of Heaven were &s;topped, and the Rain from Heaven was re&s;train'd. And the Waters returned from off the earth continually: And after the End of the hundred and fifty Days, the Waters
<PB N="394" REF="500">
were abated. And the Ark re&s;ted in the &s;eventh Month, on the &s;eventeenth Day of the Month upon the Mountains of</HI> Ararat.</P>
<P>Corollary. <HI>Hence 'tis obvious to remark the won|derful Providence of God for the Pre&s;ervation of the Ark, and the &s;ole Remains of the Old World there|in contain'd, in ordering all Circum&s;tances &s;o, that it was afloat ju&s;t all the calm Sea&s;on of the Deluge, but as &s;oon as ever any tempe&s;tuous Weather aro&s;e, was &s;afe landed on the top of the</HI> Gordyean <HI>Moun|tains</HI>.</P>
<Q>LVI. This Deluge of Waters was Univer&s;al in its extent and effect; reaching to all the Parts of the Earth, and de&s;troying all the Land Animals on the entire Surface thereof; tho&s;e only excepted which were with <HI>Noah</HI> in the Ark.</Q>
<P N="56">LVI. This might ju&s;tly have been made a Corollary of the next Propo&s;ition, (for if the Waters in any one Region, much more a com|pleat Hemi&s;phere, exceeded the Tops of the highe&s;t Mountains, it would certainly diffu&s;e it &s;elf and overflow the other al&s;o:) But being ca|pable in the pre&s;ent Hypothe&s;is of a &s;eparate Proof, de&s;erves a di&s;tinct Con&s;ideration. The Waters which were deriv'd from the Comet, the principal Source of the Deluge, were more than half univer&s;al; they primarily falling upon more than one half of the Surface of the Earth. The Subterranean Waters being in good mea&s;ure the proper effect of the Weight of the Waters pro|ceeding from the Comet, would al&s;o be as univer|&s;al as they at the lea&s;t, if not more. And with|al, if we duly con&s;ider the Velocity of the Earth's Diurnal Rotation, and that the Ma&s;s of newly acquir'd Vapours was not at fir&s;t partaker of the &s;ame, but was by degrees to receive the impre&s;&s;ion thereof, we &s;hall with ea&s;e apprehend, that a few of the fir&s;t Rotations would wind or
<PB N="395" REF="501">
wrap the&s;e, as well as the other Vapours, <HI>quite round</HI> the Earth, and thereby cau&s;e a very equal di&s;tribution of them all in the <HI>entire Atmo&s;phere</HI>, and at la&s;t render the Rains very evenly <HI>Univer&s;al</HI>. To which uniform Di&s;tribution the Nature of the Air it &s;elf, as at pre&s;ent I &s;uppo&s;e it does, might contribute: Such an Ela&s;tical Fluid as the Air &s;carce &s;uffering a la&s;ting Den&s;ity or Croud of Vapours in one Region, without communi|cating &s;ome Part to the others adjoining; that &s;o a kind of <HI>Equilibrium</HI> in the Weight, Cra&s;&s;itude, and Den&s;ity of its &s;everal Columns may be pre|&s;erv'd through the whole. So that at la&s;t, the Deluge mu&s;t have been Univer&s;al, becau&s;e every one of the Cau&s;es thereof appear to have been truly &s;o.</P>
<Q>LVII. The Waters at their utmo&s;t Height were fifteen Cubits above the highe&s;t Mountains, or about; Miles above the neighbouring Plains, or 6 Miles perpendicular above the common Surface of the Earth.</Q>
<P N="57">LVII. In order to make &s;ome e&s;timate of the Quantity of Water, which this Hypothe&s;is af|fords us: Let us allow that the Rarity of the Tail of the Comet is &s;o great, as indeed it is, that it will not afford us any Quantity con&s;ide|rable to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e; and let us &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o that the Quantity of Water i&s;&s;uing out of the Fi&s;&s;ures or Fountains of the great Deep will not afford us above one &s;ixth Part; I mean both the&s;e in Compari&s;on of a Deluge of 6 Miles height perpendicular, which we here &s;eek for. And let us examine the quantity of Vapour de|riv'd from the Atmo&s;phere of the Comet which is one Main Source and Fountain of this mighty Deluge, and &s;ee how far it will go in our pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s. If we &s;uppo&s;e our upper Cru&s;t of Earth, and its den&s;e Fluid taken together to be 200 or
<PB N="396" REF="502">
300 Miles thick, and that it were di&s;pers'd in a Sphere of 80,000 Miles in Diameter, as is the ca&s;e of a Comet's Atmo&s;phere, it would be then of almo&s;t as great Den&s;ity as that of our Air here 7 or 8 Miles above us. Let us therefore &s;uppo&s;e it to be &s;o, and by con&s;equence about 4000 times as rare as Water, and that the Earth pa&s;s'd through the &s;ame for 80,000 Miles together, as it mu&s;t do becau&s;e of the Comet's Center's coming within 10,000 Miles of us. Our Earth therefore would intercept and receive on it &s;elf a <HI>Cylindrical</HI> Column of Vapours, who&s;e Ba&s;is were at lea&s;t equal to that of a great Circle on the Earth, and who&s;e Altitude were 80,000 Miles. Now <HI>Archimedes</HI> has demon&s;trated that the entire Superficies of a Sphere or Globe is four times as large as the <HI>Area</HI> of one of its great Circles; and by con&s;equence the Column of Vapour would be but a quarter &s;o high when &s;pread over the Surface of the whole Earth, or only 20,000 Miles high: And when turn'd into Water, and reduc'd there|by to the 4000 part of its ancient Space, would cover the Earth about 5 Miles deep, even tho' there were no Mountains extant above the common Surface of the Plains and Seas. So that when allowance is made for them, as well as for the Quantities ari&s;ing from the Tail of the Comet, and from the Fi&s;&s;ures or Fountains of the Deep, the whole Quantity will cover the Earth full 6 Miles perpendicularly; which is that very height of the Waters which in this Solution was to be accounted for.</P>
<P>Corollary. <HI>If the &s;everal particulars requi&s;ite to the nice adju&s;tment of tho&s;e Computations were more exactly enquir'd into, &s;ome Light on the pre&s;ent</HI> Hypo|the&s;is, <HI>might be afforded to the Den&s;ity of the</HI> Atmo|&s;pheres <HI>and</HI> Tails <HI>of Comets, which is hitherto un|determin'd;

the con&s;ideration of which matter mu&s;t be referr'd to</HI> A&s;tronomers.</P>
<Q>LVIII. Whatever be the height of that <HI>Gordyean</HI> Mountain whereon the <HI>Ark</HI> re&s;ted <HI>now</HI>; it was <HI>at that time</HI> the highe&s;t of all others, at lea&s;t in tho&s;e Parts of the World.</Q>
<P N="57">LVII. If we con&s;ult the Figure here referr'd to, we &s;hall ea&s;ily apprehend the Rea&s;on of this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 7.</NOTE> otherwi&s;e, &s;trange Phaenomenon. For &s;eeing this Mountain was the highe&s;t in <HI>A&s;ia</HI>, or in the mid|dle Regions of our Continent; and &s;eeing withal that entire Continent, and chiefly the middle Re|gions thereof, were elevated by the greate&s;t pro|tuberance of the Aby&s;s d b c above any other cor|re&s;pondent parts of the whole Globe, the ab&s;olute or entire height of this Mountain then, would ari&s;e not only from its proper Altitude above the neighbouring Plains, but al&s;o from the Elevati|on of the whole Continent, or peculiarly of its middle Regions above the Ancient Surface of the Plains and Seas; which is the true rea&s;on why I &s;uppo&s;e this Mountain to be &s;ix Miles high above the common Surface of the Earth; while it can hardly be &s;o much as three Miles above the Neighbouring Plains. So that by this Ad|vantage of Situation, it was at the time here concern'd, higher not only than its Neighbours, which its own Elevation was &s;ufficient for, but than any other on the Face of the whole Earth: Some of which otherwi&s;e it could, I believe, by no means have pretended to match, much le&s;s to out-do in Altitude. Now altho' the pre&s;ence of the Comet which produc'd the&s;e Tides in the A|by&s;s, and elevated the entire Continents above their ancient Level, did not remain after the Di&s;ruption of the Fountains of the Deep on the fir&s;t Day of the Deluge; yet the Effect thereof the Elevation of the Continents above their Le|vel,

would not &s;o &s;oon, nay, would &s;carce ever entirely cea&s;e. We know by common Ob&s;erva|tion, that if a Solid or Settled Ma&s;s of Bodies be torn or pull'd in pieces, 'tis not ea&s;y to put eve|ry thing into its place, and reduce the whole to the &s;ame fix'd Limits, it had before. If a &s;olid compacted Mound of Earth were once &s;hatter'd and divided, were levell'd and remov'd, tho' afterward every individual Du&s;t of the former Earth were laid together again upon the very &s;ame Plot and Compa&s;s, yet would it not be im|mediately confin'd within its ancient Dimen&s;i|ons; its height would be at fir&s;t con&s;iderably greater than before; and tho' that in length of time would be by Degrees dimini&s;h'd, by the gradual &s;ettling and crouding together of the parts, and &s;o &s;ome approaches would be made thereby towards its ancient Den&s;ity and le&s;&s;er Elevation; yet neither would be entirely attain'd; in any moderate &s;pace of time at lea&s;t. And this is the very Ca&s;e before us. That Oval Figure which the Orb of Earth was &s;tretch'd to at the Deluge, would remain for a con&s;iderable time, and be many Years in &s;ettling &s;o clo&s;e together, that it might afterward remain fixt and firm for the following Generations; before which time 'tis evident, that the Regions near the Center of our <HI>Northern</HI> or larger Continent, were the high|e&s;t, and tho&s;e at 90 Degrees di&s;tance every where the lowe&s;t; and by con&s;equence at the time of the Ark's re&s;ting, the <HI>Gordyean</HI> Mountains near the Center of the <HI>Northern</HI> Continent, were ele|vated above the re&s;t, and particularly above the <HI>Pike of Teneriff</HI>, which &s;eems to be at pre&s;ent the highe&s;t of all others.

For 'tis certain, by the plaine&s;t Deduction from the ex|pre&s;s words of Scripture, that the Mountain on which the</HI> Ark <HI>re&s;ted was at that time the highe&s;t in the World.

Which Chain or Connexion I take to be &s;o &s;trong, that I believe 'twill not be po&s;&s;ible to evade its force; and &s;o what on other Arguments has been already e&s;tabli&s;h'd, is fully confirm'd by this.</HI></P>

<Q>LIX. As the Fountains of the great Deep were broken up at the very beginning of the Deluge, &s;o were they &s;topp'd at the end of 150 Days, on the &s;even|teenth Day of the &s;eventh Month.</Q>
<P N="59">LIX. That the Fountains of the great Deep in all the Regions near the <HI>Ark</HI>, to which this <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> does properly belong, would be &s;top|ped at this very time is plain, becau&s;e now, and not before nor after, the highe&s;t part of the va&s;t Tide of the Waters of the Deluge was ju&s;t ar|rived thither, and &s;o &s;topp'd the Exit of the Waters, till then a&s;cending from the inward Parts of the Earth; and by oppo&s;ing their Cour&s;e, and im|mediately pre&s;&s;ing upon and running down tho&s;e <HI>Fi&s;&s;ures</HI> into the Bowels of the Earth, would effectually change the face of Affairs there: would &s;top the Fountains of the Deep, and make tho&s;e very Outlets whence the &s;ubterraneous Waters had till then &s;pouted forth, become the Inlets to the &s;ame Waters, and to all the re&s;t al&s;o on the Face of the Earth; and the Means of draining them all off the &s;ame by degrees after|wards.</P>
<Q>LX. The Abatement and Decrea&s;e of the Waters of the Deluge was fir&s;t by a Wind, which dried up &s;ome: And, &s;econdly, by their De&s;cent thro' tho&s;e Fi&s;&s;ures, Chaps and Breaches, (at which part of them had before a&s;cended) into the Bowels of the Earth, which received the re&s;t. To which latter al&s;o the Wind, by hurrying the Waters up and down, and &s;o promoting their lighting into the before-men|tion'd Fi&s;&s;ures, was very much &s;ub&s;ervient.</Q>
<P N="60"><PB N="402" REF="508">LX. In order to the giving a &s;atisfactory Ac|count of this Propo&s;ition, and of the draining the Waters of the Deluge off the Surface of the Earth, (which to &s;ome has &s;eem'd almo&s;t as difficult to &s;olve as their fir&s;t Introduction;) It mu&s;t fir&s;t be granted, that the Air could receive and &s;u&s;tain but very incon&s;iderable Quantities, in compari&s;on of the entire Ma&s;s which lay upon the Earth; yet &s;ome it might, and would naturally do; which accordingly both the <HI>Wind</HI> here mention'd, and the <HI>Sun</HI> al&s;o took away, and turn'd into Vapour immediately after the cea&s;ing of the latter Rains. But as to all the re&s;t, there is no imaginable Place for their Reception, or whither their natural Gravity oblig'd them to retreat to, excepting the Bowels of the Earth; which mu&s;t therefore be di|&s;tinctly con&s;ider'd in this Place. Now we may re|member, from what has been formerly &s;aid, that the Quantity of Solids, or earthy Parts in the up|per Orb's primary Formation, was very much grea|ter than that of Fluids,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. 81. cum Co|roll. &amp; So|lut. 6. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> or watery Parts; and con|&s;equently, that the inward Regions of the Earth being generally dry and porous, were capable of receiving mighty Quantities of Waters, without any &s;welling, without any Alteration of the ex|ternal Figure, or vi&s;ible Bulk. And, indeed, if we allow, as we ought, any con&s;iderable Cra&s;&s;itude to this upper Orb, its <HI>interior</HI> Regions might ea&s;ily contain a greater Quantity of Waters than what was upon the Earth at the Deluge: So that all the Difficulty is now reduc'd to this, By what Pipes, Canals, or Pa&s;&s;ages, the&s;e Waters could be convey'd into the Bowels of the Earth? Which, in truth, can admit of no Di&s;pute; nothing &s;ure being to be conceiv'd more natural <HI>Inlets</HI> to the&s;e Waters, than tho&s;e very <HI>perpendicular Fi&s;&s;ures</HI>, which were the <HI>Outlets</HI> to part of them before.
<PB N="403" REF="509">
As &s;oon therefore as the Waters ceas'd to a&s;cend upwards through tho&s;e Breaches, they mu&s;t, to be &s;ure, de&s;cend downwards by the &s;ame; and this De&s;cent is more natural than the <HI>prior</HI> A&s;cent could be e&s;teem'd to be; which was a force upon them, compelling them, again&s;t their Natures, to ari&s;e up|wards, when this Retreat into the &s;ame Inter&s;tices is no other than their own proper Gravity requir'd and inclin'd them to. The ca&s;e here is in part like that of a <HI>Sieve</HI>, fir&s;t, by force, pre&s;s'd down in|to a Ve&s;&s;el of Water, till it were fill'd therewith, and then &s;uffer'd to emerge again; where, through the very &s;ame Holes at which the Waters a&s;cended into, they would afterward de&s;cend out of the <HI>Sieve</HI> again, and retreat into their own Element, as before. All that in particular de&s;erves here to be farther noted, is, the Intere&s;t of the Wind, or of the Agitations of the Waters, (<HI>Goings and Returnings</HI> in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Phra&s;e) made mention of in this Propo&s;ition. And the&s;e Commotions are, in truth, very u&s;eful, and very nece&s;&s;ary A&s;|&s;i&s;tants to the draining of the Waters from off the Earth. For when the mo&s;t part of the Fi&s;&s;ures were in the Mountains, 'twould have been a diffi|cult Thing to clear the Valleys and lower Grounds, had there been a perfect Calm and every Colle|ction of Waters remain'd quietly in its own Place. But when the Waters were &s;o violently agitated and hurried from one Place to another, they would thereby frequently light into the <HI>Fi&s;&s;ures</HI>, and Breaches, and &s;o de&s;cend as well as the re&s;t into the Heart of the Earth; very agreeably to the A&s;&s;ertion of this Propo&s;ition. As to the Ob|jection again&s;t this Method of draining away the Waters of the Flood, that the&s;e <HI>Fi&s;&s;ures</HI> would $e fill'd at the beginning of the Deluge, and per|haps in &s;ome Places drain away &s;ome of its Waters
<PB N="404" REF="510">
immediately, and &s;o hinder the Increa&s;e of the Flood for 150 Days, which yet the Sacred Hi&s;to|ry mentions, I can &s;ee no force at all in it: For let the Cracks and Fi&s;&s;ures be full during the Deluge, nay, let the Waters be in &s;ome mea|&s;ure draining away continually by &s;ome of them into the Bowels of the Earth; yet till this Drain <HI>took away</HI> more than the Rains, and the running in of the Water, and perhaps other Fi&s;&s;ures <HI>brought</HI>, the Flood would continually increa&s;e, notwith&s;tanding. And certainly the Pores, Va|cancies and Inter&s;tices of 100 or 200 Miles of Dry Earth, <HI>i. e.</HI> Earth that can &s;till admit va&s;t Quan|tities of Water (which the Thickne&s;s of the up|per Cru&s;t may well amount to) are capable of re|ceiving 5 or 6 Miles of Water into them; e&s;pe|cially if we ob&s;erve that its inward <HI>Strata</HI>, are not, as &s;ome imagine, almo&s;t wholly compos'd of tough Clay, common Stone, Whin Stone, Coal, Metalline Ores, and the like; but are very much made up of Turf, Sand, dry Earth, Gravel and &s;uch like, which will all receive great Quantities of Water, without any con&s;iderable Increa&s;e of their vi&s;ible Bulk: For the Truth of which, I appeal to the following Table of the &s;everal <HI>Strata</HI> of a Well at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI>, mention'd by no wor&s;e an Author than <HI>Varenius</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Geogr. p. 46.</NOTE> which is the be&s;t and deepe&s;t that is readily to be met with.</P>

<P><HI>Schol.</HI> 'Tis perhaps worth our Enquiry, whether mo&s;t Mens Notions of the Time for the abating of the Waters of the Deluge be not very precarious at lea&s;t, if not wholly mi&s;taken. 'Tis the general Opinion, taken from the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Hi&s;tory of the Flood, that the Waters were wholly &s;ub&s;ided, and the Earth laid as dry in a manner as 'tis at pre&s;ent, by that time <HI>Noah</HI> came out of the Ark; or in the Space of about a Year from the beginning of the Flood. 'Tis true, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;ays, that on the <HI>&s;eventeenth Day of the &s;eventh Month the Waters were abated,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. viii.3, 4. ver. 5.</NOTE> <HI>and the Ark re&s;ted on the Mountains of Ararat:</HI> That on the <HI>fir&s;t Day of the Tenth Month the Tops of the Mountains were &s;een:</HI> That on the <HI>fir&s;t Day of the next Year the Waters were dried up from off the Earth</HI>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">ver. 13.</NOTE> And then la&s;tly, That on the <HI>twenty &s;eventh Day of the &s;econd Month was the Earth dried</HI>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">ver. 14. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Noah</HI> call'd out of the Ark. But all this may be very true, and yet va&s;t Quan|tities of the Waters of the Deluge might at the &s;ame time remain on the face of the Earth. And as the pre&s;ent Ocean may be &s;till a part of the &s;ame, &s;o the re&s;t of them might require a hundred or two hundred Years before they arriv'd at or near to their pre&s;ent Sub&s;idence and Condition. And this, I think, is the truth of the Ca&s;e; and is &s;o far from contradicting the Sacred Hi&s;tory, that it may be e&s;tabli&s;h'd by an Ob&s;ervation or two

from thence, as well as by the pre&s;ent <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature. As to the Sacred Hi&s;tory of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>, 'tis fir&s;t evident, that the Mountainous Regions about <HI>Ararat</HI>, or the <HI>Gordyean</HI> Mountains, e&s;pecially &s;ince they were, from my <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>, particularly eleva|ted above the re&s;t, might be wholly clear of the Waters in a Year's time; and yet the lower Plains and Valleys in a very different Ca&s;e, and &s;till to a great Depth under the Water: And 'tis as evident, 2dly, That we have no authentick Account of the lower Plains being become dry and habitable, even in Regions more elevated than many others, I mean about the middle Parts of our Continent, till the building of <HI>Babel</HI>, the Confu&s;ion of Languages, and the Di&s;per&s;ion of the Nations over the Earth; none of which happen'd, even according to the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Chronology, before the Second Century from the Deluge, in the Days of <HI>Peleg</HI>. And then as to the pre&s;ent <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. x.2. &amp; xi.1, 2.</NOTE> I think they determine the Que&s;tion before us, and &s;uffi|ciently demon&s;trate the longer abode of the Wa|ters of the Deluge upon the Earth than is com|monly allow'd: For as many Maritime Coun|tries (which I have already ob&s;erved, and others have noted the &s;ame) do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corol. 2. &s;upr&agrave;.

Near my former Habitation, at <HI>Lowe&s;toft</HI> in <HI>Suffolk</HI>, up|on the Sea-coa&s;t, there is a pretty high and re|markable Cliff, at the lea&s;t twenty Foot above the Surface of the Ocean adjoining; and yet 'tis to the very top <HI>Stratum</HI> of all almo&s;t as evidently the Product of the Waters, laying Heaps, <HI>Strata</HI>,

and Beds of <HI>Sand</HI> and <HI>Chingle</HI>; as that very Shore on which we &s;tand, and which is daily made and removed by the Tides and Waves of the pre&s;ent Ocean. And as I do not doubt from the always equal Height of the Ocean every where, that 'tis frequently thus in other Places al&s;o; &s;o this is, I think, a plain Evidence that the Ocean has been at lea&s;t 20 Foot higher than 'tis now; and that for a long time together; &s;ufficient I mean to heap up &s;uch mighty Beds of Sand and Chingle as the pre&s;ent Ob&s;ervation does require. Which of it &s;elf is at once a Demon&s;tration that all the lower Regions near the Sea have formerly been drown'd, and lain under Water; and at the &s;ame time does fully confirm that length of time which I a&s;&s;ert was taken up in the entire Sub&s;idence of the Waters of the Deluge.</P>

<P N="65">LXV. The Po&s;ition of the Continents de|pended mainly on the time of the Year when the Comet pa&s;&s;ed by. For &s;ince the Comet de&s;cend|ed in the Plain of the Ecliptick from the Regi|ons almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the Sun, and came to its neare&s;t di&s;tance about 130 degrees onward from the Point in the Ecliptick oppo&s;ite to the Sun, before which, and yet &s;carce till after the Comet were pa&s;t 90 Degrees, or the Periphery of the Ecliptick, would the Tides be great enough to bur&s;t the Orb of Earth, and fix the Centers of the Continents; by con&s;idering the place of the Earth in the Ecliptick, and counting about 100 Degrees onward, one may determine the Lati|tude of the Point on the Earth directly expos'd to the Comet's Body, and by con&s;equence of its op|po&s;ite Point al&s;o; about which Points the two

<P N="66">LXVI. This Propo&s;ition (which more nicely determines that Po&s;ition of the Continents which the la&s;t more generally a&s;&s;erted) is thus demon|&s;trated.

Now the bur&s;t|ing of the Orb is to be &s;uppos'd before the Co|met's neare&s;t di&s;tance; and by con&s;equence the Centers of the two Continents a and b ought to have the Latitude of the Points about 90, or ra|ther nearer an 100 Degrees onward beyond that oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Sun</HI>, or beyond the <HI>Sun</HI> it &s;elf.

If the Surface of the Earth before the Deluge had been even and &s;mooth, without Mountains and Vallies; and their Con&s;equents, Seas and dry Land, the pa&s;&s;ing by of the Comet mu&s;t indeed, as before, have certainly caus'd a di&s;tinction of the two Continents, and mu&s;t have interpos'd an Ocean between them; but then the&s;e two Circum&s;tances would have obtain'd al&s;o, fir&s;t, that all the Waters of the entire Globe would have left the Continents, and &s;olely com|pos'd an Ocean; and &s;econdly, That the Ter|mination or Boundaries of the Ocean and the Continents would have been circular, round, and even on every Side.

'tis not impo&s;&s;ible that the con&s;iderably long lives of the fir&s;t Po&s;tdiluvian Patriarchs might in part depend on the vigorous Con&s;titution of their Fa|thers, not to be immediately impair'd to the ut|mo&s;t, or de&s;troy'd in their Po&s;terity, till by de|grees, and in length of time it was effected. But be&s;ides, 'tis to be con&s;ider'd, which I take to be the principal thing, that &s;eeing the corrupted Atmo&s;phere, with the pernicious Steams ari&s;ing from the newly acquir'd Chaotick Cru&s;t, or Se|diment of the Waters, and their unhappy Effects on the Fruits, as well as living Creatures upon the Earth, mu&s;t be allow'd the occa&s;ion and cau&s;e of the &s;hortning of human Life; &s;uch Regions as were free&s;t from, or mo&s;t elevated above the &s;aid Sediment, or Chaotick Atmo&s;phere, mu&s;t have chiefly continu'd as they were before, and &s;o the ancient Longevity would chiefly be pre|&s;erv'd therein.

Grounds, and principally by the gradual &s;ub&s;i|dence of tho&s;e Regions them&s;elves into the gro&s;s Atmo&s;phere below, they became gradually liable to tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, and that &s;hortne&s;s of Life, which we before &s;hew'd to have been the &s;ad Ef|fects thereof, and to which all Mankind has &s;ince been &s;ubject.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Graunt. p. $9, 85, 86.</NOTE>Corollary 1. <HI>Mankind increa&s;ed va&s;tly more &s;oon after the Deluge than in the&s;e latter Ages of the World.

<Q>LXXII.

<P N="72">LXXII. 'Tis not to be &s;uppos'd, that the Wa|ters of the Deluge were merely the pure Ele|ment of Water, &s;incere and unmixed. What came from the Comet's Atmo&s;phere, mu&s;t par|take of its earthy heterogeneous Mixtures; and what was &s;queez'd up from beneath, mu&s;t carry
<PB N="418" REF="524">
up much Dirt and Earthy Matter along with it. Be&s;ides which, as &s;oon as the &s;tormy Weather began, and as the va&s;t Tide of Waters went a|long from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t</HI>, the &s;oak'd and loo&s;en'd Tops of Mountains would ea&s;ily, by the Winds and Waves together, be wa&s;h'd off, or carried a|way into the Ma&s;s of Waters, and increa&s;e the impurity and earthy Mixtures thereof. On all which Accounts, the Waters of the Deluge would be a very impure, thick, and muddy Fluid, and afford &s;uch a quantity of earthy Matter as would bear &s;ome &s;mall Proportion to that of even the Water it &s;elf. Now this earthy Matter being heavier than the Water, would by degrees &s;ettle downwards, and compo&s;e fir&s;t a mighty thick, dirty, muddy Fluid in the lower Regions of the Waters, and at la&s;t a plain earthy Sediment at the bottom of them; which would at once &s;poil and bury the old Surface of the Ground, and be|come a new Cru&s;t or Cover on the face thereof. Now, that we may &s;ee whether this Sediment or Cru&s;t could be &s;o thick and con&s;iderable as this Phaenomenon requires, let us &s;uppo&s;e, as before, the perpendicular height of the Waters of the Deluge to have been &s;ome 6 Miles above the com|mon Surface of the Plains and Seas, and the 60th part only of the entire Fluid on the Face of the Earth to have been earthy parts fit to compo&s;e the Sediment or Cru&s;t before mention'd. Let us al&s;o remember what has been already ob&s;erv'd from Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>, That Earth is nearly Five times as den&s;e and heavy as Water:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hypoth. 2. prius.</NOTE> So that the 60th Part in the Quantity of Matter, would only take up the 300th Part of the whole Space, ei|ther in the Waters, or when 'twas &s;ettled down by it &s;elf, and became a New Cru&s;t or Orb upon the
<PB N="419" REF="525">
Earth. If we then divide 31,680 the number of Feet in 5 Miles, the whole height of the Wa|ters, (not here to allow for the incon&s;iderable &s;paces po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the extant Parts of the Earth) by 300, the Quotient will &s;hew the Cra&s;&s;itude or Thickne&s;s of this Sediment or Cru&s;t covering the Face of the Earth, <HI>viz.</HI> about 105 Feet, one place taken with another indifferently. Which Quantity fully accounts for the Propo&s;ition we are upon, and agrees with the Ob&s;ervations made in the Bowels of our pre&s;ent Earth, to as great ac|curacy as one could de&s;ire or expect.</P>
<P>Corollary 1. <HI>Hence it appears, That the Earth was generally uninhabitable for &s;everal Years after the Flood: This new factitious Sediment of the Waters requiring no little &s;pace of time e're it would be fully &s;ettled, its</HI> Strata <HI>con&s;olidated, its Surface become hard and dry, and its Vegetables &s;prung out of it; before which time it mu&s;t have been uninhabitable by Man, and the other dry Land Animals</HI>.</P>
<P>Coroll. 2. <HI>Hence we may &s;ee the Care and Wi&s;|dom of Divine Providence for the Pre&s;ervation and Maintenance of</HI> Noah, <HI>and of all the Creatures in the Ark, after their coming out of the &s;ame again; by ordering all things &s;o, that the Ark &s;hould re&s;t on the highe&s;t Mountain in the World, and that the Waters &s;hould &s;o little &s;urpa&s;s the &s;ame, that the Sediment thereof could neither &s;poil the Fruits of the Ground, nor render the Surface uninhabitable, as it did on the other Regions of the Earth. For &s;ince the quantity of the Sediment would generally be proportionable eve|ry where to the perpendicular height of the Waters o|ver the Surface of the Ground below; tho' it would cover all the other Regions of the whole Earth, yet
<PB N="420" REF="526">
on this highe&s;t of all the Mountains, (cover'd but a few Days, or perhaps Hours, with any Waters, and they never above fifteen Cubits perpendicular height) the quantity of the Sediment would here be perfectly incon&s;iderable, and the Earth would not be at all alter'd from what it was before, nor its Vegetables hurt by this univer&s;al Deluge. So that this, and this only was the Spot of Ground capable of receiving the Ark, and of &s;u&s;taining the Creatures therein; till afterwards the re&s;t of the Earth became fit for their De&s;cent and Habitation. To this Spot therefore, by &s;uch a wonderful Adju&s;tment of all the requi&s;ite Cir|cum&s;tances of the Deluge, pre&s;erv'd and di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the re&s;t of the World, the Divine Provi|dence did conduct the Ark; and on this was laid the Foundation of the pre&s;ent Race of Mankind, and of all tho&s;e Terre&s;trial Animals which are now on the Face of the whole Earth; which otherwi&s;e had pe|ri&s;h'd at their Exit out of the Ark, notwith&s;tanding their wonderful Pre&s;ervation therein during the Rage of the Deluge.</HI></P>
<P>Coroll. 3. <HI>Hence appears a certain way of de|termining whether this Account of the pre&s;ent upper Earth, as derived from the bare Sediment of the Waters of the Deluge, be true or not.

<P>Corollary. <HI>Hence the Ancient Years beginning at the</HI> Autumnal Equinox, <HI>and the con&s;equent commencing of the Deluge the &s;eventeenth Day of the &s;econd Month from thence, and not from the Spring, is evidenc'd by this very Ob&s;ervation which Dr.</HI> Woodward, <HI>the Author thereof, &s;up|po&s;es would prove the contrary.

One Coun|try contains &s;ome certain kinds of <HI>Metals</HI> and <HI>Mine|rals</HI>, another contains quite different Ones. Nay, the &s;ame Lump or Ma&s;s of Earth not &s;eldom con|tains the Corpu&s;cles of &s;everal <HI>Metals</HI> and <HI>Minerals</HI> confu&s;edly intermixt one with another, and with its own Earthy Parts. All which Irregularities, with &s;everal others that might be ob&s;erved, even contrary to the Law of &s;pecifick Gravity, in the pla|cing of the different <HI>Strata</HI> of the Earth, demon&s;trate the original <HI>Fund</HI> or <HI>Promptuary</HI> of all this upper factitious Earth, to have been in a very wild, con|fu&s;ed and <HI>Chaotick</HI> Condition.</Q>
<P N="84">LXXXIV. Seeing the Sediment of the Wa|ters was compos'd of what Earthy Matter was uncertainly brought up out of the inner Earth, and of what a true and proper Chaos afforded, the&s;e Phaenomena are as natural and accountable therefrom, as on any other mechanical Hypothe|&s;is they mu&s;t appear &s;trange, perplexing, and in|explicable to Philo&s;ophick Minds. For certain|ly by the irregular di&s;po&s;ition of Bodies in &s;uch a Chaotick Sediment, and by the as irregular Tem|pe&s;ts and Commotions of the Waters, particular|ly by that con&s;tant and notable Current of the main Ma&s;s of them from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t</HI>, ari&s;ing from their not yet fully accompanying the Earth in its Diurnal Motion, and its con&s;equent Effects,

the genuine Order, Cra&s;&s;itude, and Po&s;ition of the <HI>Strata</HI>, &s;ub&s;iding &s;till all the while according to their &s;everal Specifick Gravities, would be &s;ufficiently di&s;turb'd and interrupted; and upon the whole, ju&s;t &s;uch an irregular Cru&s;t would be form'd by the Sediments of Waters as we find in fact this upper one of our Earth really is.</P>
<Q>LXXXV. The uppermo&s;t and Lighte&s;t <HI>Stratum</HI> of Soil or <HI>Garden Mold</HI>, as 'tis called, which is the proper Seminary of the Vegetable Kingdom; is &s;ince the Deluge very thick &s;pread u&s;ually in the Vallies and Plains, but very thin on the Ridges or Tops of Mountains: Which la&s;t for want thereof are fre|quently Stony, Rocky, Bare and Barren.</Q>
<P N="85">LXXXV. Two plain Rea&s;ons are to be given for this Phaenomenon: (1.) The Quantity of Water, and its Sediment; and by con&s;equence of Soil or fertile Earth was le&s;s over the Moun|tains than over the Plains and Vallies. (2.) Af|ter the Sub&s;idence of the Sediment, and before its entire Con&s;olidation, the Tops of Mountains were mo&s;t expos'd to the fury of the Winds and Storms; which would therefore more ea&s;ily bear away that lighte&s;t and lea&s;t united <HI>Stratum</HI> which lay uppermo&s;t in tho&s;e bleak Places, than in the more retir'd and skreen'd Plains and Vallies; and by dimini&s;hing the Soil in the former, and thereby augmenting it in the latter Places, mo&s;t ea&s;ily make all things corre&s;pond in this Propo|&s;ition.</P>
<Q>LXXXVI. Of the four Ancient Rivers of Paradi&s;e there are &s;till two remaining, tho' not exactly in the Old Channels: But the other two are &s;o utterly lo&s;t, that the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> De&s;cription does not at all a|gree to them at pre&s;ent.</Q>
<P N="86">LXXXVI. That the great Rivers would &s;till retain in great mea&s;ure their old Cour&s;es, has
<PB N="435" REF="541">
been ob&s;erv'd already: And &s;eeing the Fountains, and the general Inequalities of the Earth, on which their Origin and Channels depend, were the &s;ame generally before as &s;ince the Deluge, there can be no doubt thereof. As to the Rivers of <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> them&s;elves, their Channels being now bury'd perhaps more than an hundred Feet under the Sediment of the Waters of the Deluge, 'tis in vain to expect that the Po&s;tdiluvian Rivers &s;hould corre&s;pond to the De&s;cription of tho&s;e Antediluvian ones. 'Tis well that the pre&s;ent <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates</HI> are not &s;o much chang'd as the re&s;t, that we may not be de&s;titute of all means for the finding out the original Situation of tho&s;e four Primitive Rivers, and thereby of that Coun|try and <HI>Garden of Eden</HI> which was the primary Habitation of Mankind.</P>
<Q>LXXXVII. Tho&s;e <HI>Metals</HI> or <HI>Minerals</HI> which the <HI>Mo|&s;aick</HI> De&s;cription of Paradi&s;e, and its bordering Re|gions, takes &s;uch particular notice of, and the Pro|phets &s;o emphatically refer to, are not now met with &s;o plentifully therein.</Q>
<P N="87">LXXXVII. The pre&s;ent upper Earth being, as we have &s;een, factitious, and a new Cru&s;t &s;ince the Flood covering over the ancient Sur|face thereof, tho&s;e primitive Trea&s;ures mu&s;t lie too deep in the Bowels of the pre&s;ent Earth to be ea&s;ily approach'd by us, and &s;o are entirely lo&s;t as to the pre&s;ent U&s;e or Enjoyment of Man|kind.</P>
<Q>LXXXVIII. This Deluge of Waters was a &s;ignal In|&s;tance of the Divine Vengance on a Wicked World; and was the Effect of the Peculiar and Extraordi|nary Providence of God.</Q>
<P N="88">LXXXVIII. Tho' the pa&s;&s;ing by of a Comet, and all tho&s;e Effects of it in the drowning of the World, of which we have &s;o largely di&s;cours'd hitherto, be not to be &s;tiled in the common u&s;e
<PB N="436" REF="542">
of the Word <HI>Miraculous</HI>, (though in no very improper Sen&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. Solut. 2. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> all &s;uch Events may have <HI>that</HI> Appellation, of which before;) yet is there the greate&s;t Rea&s;on in the World to attribute this mighty Turn and Cata&s;trophe of Nature, to the Divine Providence, and the immediate, volun|tary, actual interpo&s;ition of God; and that in the&s;e en&s;uing Particulars, and on the&s;e following Accounts; which I &s;hall be the &s;horter upon, as having in the place fore-mention'd explain'd my Mind &s;omewhat largely about things of this Nature. (1.) The Bodies made u&s;e of in this and the like Changes of Nature, are originally the Creatures of God, and continually pre&s;erv'd by him; and &s;o what they are in&s;trumental in, ought mo&s;t ju&s;tly to be a&s;crib'd to the principal Cau&s;e, the great Creator and Con&s;ervator of them all. (2.) All tho&s;e Powers of Attraction or Gra|vitation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and tho&s;e Laws of Motion by which the&s;e Bodies are capable of producing &s;uch Effects, are alike owing to the Divine Operation, Appointment, and Efficacy, both in their pri|mitive Impre&s;&s;ion, and continual Energy; and &s;o &s;till the Effects them&s;elves are to be a&s;cribed to a Divine Original. (3.) That particular Con&s;titution of the Earth on the face of the fluid Aby&s;s, and other &s;uch Di&s;po&s;itions, where|by it became &s;ubject to an univer&s;al Deluge, were al&s;o the Con&s;equents of the Divine Power and Providence in the formation of the Earth. (4.) That peculiar Situation or Con&s;titution of the Orbits and Motions of Comets, whereby they, by rea&s;on of their pa&s;&s;ing through the Planetary Sy&s;tem each Revolution, are fit to cau&s;e &s;uch great Mutations in it, was the Effect of the particular Order and Di&s;po&s;ition of God, in the primary Frame of the Univer&s;e. (5.)
<PB N="437" REF="543">
The Coincidence of the Trajectory of a Co|met's Orbit either exactly or nearly with the line of the Earths Orbit can have no other Foundation in Nature, than a like de&s;ign'd and contriv'd Ap|pointment of God. (6.) The &s;o nice and exact Ad|ju&s;tment of the Motions of both the Comet and the Earth; that the former &s;hould pa&s;s ju&s;t &s;o near, and impart &s;uch a certain Quantity of Wa|ters, neither more nor le&s;s than would drown the World, and ju&s;t cover the highe&s;t Mountain, and yet reach no farther; in &s;hort, as wou'd &s;e|cure the Ark for future Generations, and yet not leave one dry-Land Animal be&s;ides alive; this Exactne&s;s is a mo&s;t peculiar and &s;trange Effect of the mo&s;t wi&s;e and &s;agacious Providence of God in this mighty Revolution. But (7.) La&s;tly, (to omit repeating &s;ome things before ob&s;erv'd as we pa&s;s'd along) The preci&s;e <HI>Time</HI> of the pa&s;&s;ing by of the Comet, and thereby of de&s;troying the World, is, in the mo&s;t peculiar Manner and high|e&s;t degree, the re&s;ult of the divine Providence. That exactly at a time which was fit and proper, and in an Age that ju&s;tly de&s;erv'd &s;o great a Judgment, the Comet &s;hould come by, and over|whelm the World, is very remarkably and ex|traordinarily the Finger of God him&s;elf. That Omni&s;cient Being who fore&s;aw when the dege|neracy of human Nature would be arriv'd at an <HI>un&s;ufferable</HI> Degree of Wickedne&s;s, the Iniqui|ties of the World would be compleately <HI>full</HI>; and when con&s;equently his Vengeance ought to fall upon them; predi&s;po&s;ed and preadapted the Or|bits and Motions of both the Comet and the Earth, &s;o that at that very time, and only at that very time, the former &s;hould pa&s;s clo&s;e by the latter, and bring that dreadful Puni&s;hment up|on
<PB N="438" REF="544">
them. Had not God Almighty on purpo&s;e thus adju&s;ted the Moments and Cour&s;es of each, 'twere infinite odds that &s;uch a Conjunction or Coincidence of a Comet and a Planet, would ne|ver have happen'd during the whole &s;pace, be|tween the Creation and Conflagration of this World; much more at &s;uch a critical Point of time when Mankind, by their unparallel'd Wick|edne&s;s were de&s;erving of, and only di&s;pos'd for this unparallel'd Vengance, no le&s;s than almo&s;t an utter Exci&s;ion.</P>
<P>And this I take to be the Secret of the Divine Providence in the Government of the World, and that whereby the Rewards and Puni&s;hments of God's Mercy and Ju&s;tice are di&s;tributed to his Rational Creatures, without any Di&s;turbance of the &s;ettled Cour&s;e of Nature, or a Miraculous Interpo&s;ition on every Occa&s;ion. Our Imper|fection is &s;uch that we can only act <HI>pro re nat&agrave;</HI>, can never know before-hand the Behaviour or Actions of Men; neither can we fore&s;ee what Circum&s;tances and Conjunctures will happen at any certain time hereafter; and &s;o we cannot provide for future Events, nor predi&s;po&s;e things in &s;uch a manner that every one &s;hould be dealt with, or every thing done no otherwi&s;e than if we were then alive and pre&s;ent, we &s;hould think proper and rea&s;onable, and &s;hould actually do. But in the Divine Operation 'tis quite otherwi&s;e: God's Pre&s;cience enables him to act after a more &s;ublime Manner; and by a con&s;tant Cour&s;e of Nature, and Chain of Mechanical Cau&s;es, to do every thing &s;o, as it &s;hall not be di&s;tingui&s;hable from a particular Interpo&s;ition of his Power, nor be otherwi&s;e than on &s;uch a particular Interpo&s;i|tion would have been brought to pa&s;s. He who
<PB N="439" REF="545">
has created all things, and given them their &s;e|veral Powers and Faculties, fore&s;ees the Effects of 'em all: At once looks through the entire Train of future Cau&s;es, Actions, and Events, and &s;ees at what Periods, and in what Manner 'twill be nece&s;&s;ary and expedient to bring about any Changes, be&s;tow any Mercies, or inflict any Pu|ni&s;hments on the World: Which being unque&s;ti|onably true, 'tis evident He can as well provide and predi&s;po&s;e natural Cau&s;es for tho&s;e Mutations, Mercies or Judgments before-hand, he can as ea&s;ily put the Machine into &s;uch Motions as &s;hall, without a nece&s;&s;ity of mending or correcting it, corre&s;pond to all the&s;e fore&s;een Events or Actions, as make way for &s;uch Alterations afterward by giving a random force to the whole: And when the&s;e two Ways are equally po&s;&s;ible, I need not &s;ay which is mo&s;t agreeable to the Divine Per|fections and mo&s;t worthy of God. So that when the Univer&s;al Cour&s;e of Nature, with all the Powers and Effects thereof, were at fir&s;t deriv'd from, and are continually upheld by God; and when nothing falls out any otherwi&s;e, or at any other time, than was determin'd by Divine Ap|pointment in the Primitive Formation of the Univer&s;e: To a&s;&s;ign Phy&s;ical and Mechanical Cau&s;es for the Deluge, or &s;uch mighty Judgments of God upon the Wicked, is &s;o far from taking away the Divine Providence therein, that it &s;uppo&s;es and demon&s;trates its Intere&s;t in a more Noble, Wi&s;e and Divine Manner than the bring|ing in always a miraculous Power would do. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a <HI>Fulmen</HI> or Thunderbolt originally, and on purpo&s;e, put into &s;uch a Motion, as with|out any farther Interpo&s;ition of Providence, would direct it to the Head of a Bla&s;phemer;
<PB N="440" REF="546">
and whil&s;t he was cur&s;ing his Maker, &s;trike him dead upon the Spot; which the Pre&s;cience and Power of God &s;hew to be equally po&s;&s;ible with a pre&s;ent Miracle: I think &s;uch a violent Death would be as properly <HI>extraordinary</HI>, and a <HI>Di|vine Judgment</HI>, as any other what&s;oever: Which I take to have been the very ca&s;e of the Deluge, which I am here peculiarly concern'd about. <HI>Nature is God's Con&s;titution</HI>, and ever &s;ub&s;ervient to him; and the State of the <HI>Natural</HI> is always accommodated to that of the <HI>Moral</HI> World. What is done by <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Second Cau&s;es</HI>, is mo&s;t properly done by God at la&s;t, who is ultimately and really almo&s;t all we can mean by tho&s;e Names.</P>
<P>Corollary. <HI>What has been here &s;aid upon this Occa&s;ion, if rightly under&s;tood and apply'd to all other Ca&s;es, would clear our Minds from many of tho&s;e Perplexities about the Divine Providence which are ready to di&s;turb 'em. For In&s;tance: We pray to God for fruitful Sea&s;ons, for Health, for Peace, for the Succe&s;s of our Endeavours, for a ble&s;&s;ing on our Food and Phy&s;ick, and deprecate the contrary Mi&s;e|ries from us: Yet at the &s;ame time we &s;ee the Sea&s;ons depend on the &s;ettled Cour&s;e of the Sun, or other na|tural and nece&s;&s;ary Cau&s;es; we find our Health or Sickne&s;s to be the proper Effects of our Diet and Re|gimen; we ob&s;erve Peace and War &s;ubject to the In|trigues of Princes, and the plain re&s;ults of vi&s;ible conjun|ctures in human Affairs: we know that worldly Prudence and Cunning has a main Stroke in the Succe&s;s of Mens Labours; we feel the advantageons Effects of &s;ome Food and Phy&s;ick, and have Rea&s;on to believe the &s;ame does very much re&s;ult from the Goodne&s;s of the Drugs, the Fitne&s;s of the Proportion, the Di&s;po&s;i|tion of the Body, and the Skill of the Phy&s;ician; and can frequently give a plain and Mechanical Rea|&s;on
<PB N="441" REF="547">
of the different Operations of all tho&s;e things; neither do we hope for the Exerci&s;e of a</HI> miraculous <HI>Power in the&s;e or the like Ca&s;es. The Con&s;ideration and Compari&s;on of all the&s;e things together frequently puzzles the Minds of good Men, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are more Contemplative and Philo&s;ophical, and makes 'em wonder what Intere&s;t our Devotions, or what Ad|vantage our Prayers can have. Second Cau&s;es will work according to their Natures, let Men's Supplica|tions be never &s;o importunate: And to expect a Mi|racle in an&s;wer to every Petition, is more than the mo&s;t Religious dare pretend to. This</HI> Dilemma <HI>has had a contrary Effect upon the Minds of Men; while the</HI> Philo&s;opher <HI>was in Danger of doubting of the Succe&s;s, and &s;o ready to grow cold in his Devotions; and the more unthinking, yet more religious, Man re|jected the Con&s;ideration of the Manner, or the Ope|ration of &s;econd Cau&s;es, and more wi&s;ely look'd up only to God, and imagin'd him immediately concern'd in every Occurrence, and on that Principle doubted not the Effect of his Prayers. But 'tis, methinks, evident that neither of the&s;e were exactly in the Right; and equally &s;o, that the due Con&s;ideration of what has been above-&s;aid, would prevent the</HI> Dilemma, <HI>and take away all rea&s;onable Scruple. 'Tis true, that Natural Cau&s;es will operate as u&s;ual. 'Tis al&s;o true that Miracles are not ordinarily to be expected: But withal 'tis as true that the &s;ame all-wi&s;e Creator, who appointed that con&s;tant Cour&s;e of Nature, fore&s;aw at the &s;ame time all tho&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions of Men, and in particular tho&s;e Devotions of his Wor&s;hippers, to which &s;uitable Rewards were to be provided, and &s;uitable An&s;wers returned; and therefore has &s;o ordered the</HI> Series <HI>of Natural Cau&s;es, as to make that very Pro|vi&s;ion for the &s;ame, which otherwi&s;e he would have done by the miraculous Interpo&s;ition of his Providence; and which therefore is equally to be a&s;cribed to him with
<PB N="442" REF="548">
the greate&s;t Wonders. 'Tis true, the Frame of Na|ture is now con&s;tant and &s;ettled: But 'tis true al&s;o that it was &s;o &s;ettled on the Pro&s;pect of the moral Be|haviour, and in corre&s;pondence to the good or bad Actions of Mankind, fore&s;een and pre&s;uppo&s;ed in the Primitive Con&s;titution of all: And by Con&s;equence whatever Benefits or Afflictions the con&s;tant cour&s;e of Nature and &s;econd Cau&s;es bring to us, are equally ca|pable to be the Matter of our Prayers or Deprecati|ons, of our Humiliation or Gratitude before God, as the immediate Effects of a miraculous Power; and the Divine Providence no le&s;s to be acknowledged and addre&s;&s;ed to in the former than in the latter Ca&s;e. But becau&s;e our Imperfection is &s;o great that the Con|&s;ideration of the</HI> Priority <HI>of the</HI> future Actions <HI>of Men to the</HI> Pre&s;cience of God <HI>in the Order of Na|ture; and the Dependance of the</HI> latter <HI>on the</HI> for|mer, <HI>is too high for our Comprehen&s;ions, and tho' de|mon&s;trable by, yet in&s;crutable to the Rea&s;on of Man|kind; and becau&s;e we are therefore &s;till ready to con|ceive what is foreknown by God to be nece&s;&s;ary and inevitable; let the moral Behaviour of Men be as it will: Becau&s;e I &s;ay, this</HI> Pre&s;cience <HI>of God is too</HI> Divine <HI>a thing to be ea&s;ily penetrated and applied by us to all Occa&s;ions, I confe&s;s 'tis the mo&s;t</HI> Obvious <HI>and the mo&s;t</HI> Prudent, <HI>as well as the mo&s;t</HI> Scriptural Way <HI>to keep within our Faculties, and always to &s;up|po&s;e an immediate Exerting of a new Power in every new Turn in the World; and without the trouble&s;ome Inqui&s;ition into the Nature and De&s;ign of the Primi|tive Con&s;titution of the Material World, to refer all Things to an immediate Providence: Into which every one mu&s;t</HI> ultimately <HI>and</HI> originally <HI>be re&s;olved, and which has as well and as congruou&s;ly taken care of all Events, as if &s;uch a miraculous Efficiency were really concerned on every individual Occa&s;ion. Which whole Matter thus explained, may be of U&s;e to tho&s;e who
<PB N="443" REF="549">
through the not under&s;tanding the Method of the Di|vine Providence, and its Con&s;i&s;tency with an uninter|rupted Cour&s;e of Nature, have perplexed their own Minds, and endangered their Religion: Which per|nicious Scruples true Philo&s;ophy, when rightly under|&s;tood, is the only Means of di&s;pelling and preventing. Nothing being more true or more momentous than this, that</HI> 'Tis ever our Ignorance or Mi&s;takes only, that &s;ully the Providence of God, or dimini&s;h our Religious Affections to him.</P>

<P><HI>Scholium</HI> 2. Having now fini&s;h'd my <HI>Account of the Deluge</HI>, I &s;hall here add a mighty Atte&s;tation which the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Adver&s;ary of my Theory, has given to this part of it: And being the Confe&s;&s;ion of an Adver&s;ary, D. <HI>Keill</HI>, and there|fore to be &s;ure no other than what was extorted by the plain force of Rea&s;on and Argument, is, I think, of great Con&s;equence in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, and &s;ufficient to induce all others who are either le&s;s competent Judges of the Nature of that E|vidence I have brought, or have not &s;o carefully con&s;ider'd it, to re-examine it more carefully than they have yet done, and not to be deterr'd
<PB N="445" REF="551">
by any le&s;&s;er Mi&s;takes I may have been at fir&s;t guilty of, from enquiring whether in the main I have not Evidence for what I have a&s;&s;erted. Dr. <HI>Keill</HI>'s Words are the&s;e: <HI>I cannot but acknowledge, that the</HI> Author of the New Theory of the Earth, <HI>has made greater Di&s;coveries, and proceeded on more Philo&s;ophical Principles, than all the Theori&s;ts before him have done. In his Theory there is &s;ome very &s;trange Coincidents, which make it indeed probable, That a Comet at the time of the Deluge pa&s;s'd by the Earth. It is &s;urprizing to ob&s;erve the exact Corre|&s;pondence between the</HI> Lunar <HI>and</HI> Solar <HI>Year, upon the Suppo&s;ition of a Circular Orbit, in which the Earth moved before the Deluge.

<P N="90">XC. As we have given an Account of the <HI>U|niver&s;al Deluge</HI> from the Approach of a Comet in its <HI>De&s;cent towards</HI> the Sun; &s;o will it not be dif|ficult to account for the <HI>General Conflagration</HI> from the like Approach of a Comet in its <HI>A&s;cent from</HI> the Sun. For 'tis evident from what has been already explain'd, that in ca&s;e a Comet pa&s;s'd behind the Earth, though it were in its De&s;cent, yet if it came near enough, and were it &s;elf big enough, it would &s;o much retard the Earth's an|nual Motion, and oblige it to revolve in an <HI>Ellip|&s;is</HI> &s;o near to the Sun in its <HI>Perihelion</HI>, that the Sun it &s;elf would &s;corch and burn, di&s;&s;olve and de&s;troy it in the mo&s;t prodigious Degree; and this Combu&s;tion being renew'd every Revolution, would render the Earth a perfect <HI>Chaos</HI> again, and change it from a Planet to a Comet for ever after. 'Tis evident <HI>this</HI> is a &s;ufficient Cau&s;e of a general Conflagration with a Witne&s;s; and &s;uch an one as wou'd entirely ruin the Make of the
<PB N="447" REF="553">
pre&s;ent, and the Po&s;&s;ibility of a future World. On which la&s;t Account, if we allow the follow|ing Phaenomena, we mu&s;t not introduce <HI>this</HI>, at this Period however; but &s;ee whether a Confla|gration of a le&s;s de&s;tructive, and more refining Nature be not to be expected, and may not be accounted for. And here let it be ob&s;erv'd, that the Central Heat of it &s;elf &s;eems &s;ufficient to burn up, and di&s;&s;olve the upper Earth; (as tho&s;e who with Dr. <HI>Woodward</HI>, own the Power and Vehemence of the &s;ame now, and its a&s;toni&s;h|ing Force, and terrable Effects in Earthquakes, Eruptions of <HI>Volcano</HI>'s, and other Phaenomena of pre&s;ent Nature, ought to allow;) if the&s;e two Things were by any means remov'd; I mean the Waters of the Seas and Ocean, and the Coldne&s;s of the Air: For 'tis the va&s;t Quantity of Wa|ters of the Earth, and the Coldne&s;s of the mid|dle Region of the Air every where, and of the whole Air in the Frigid <HI>Zones</HI>, returning the Va|pours <HI>cold down</HI> again, which were &s;ent <HI>up</HI> into 'em never &s;o <HI>hot</HI>, which &s;eems &s;till to prevent the Effects of the Subterraneous Heat, and to hinder the Conflagration of the Earth. If there|fore the pa&s;&s;ing by of a Comet be capable of emptying the Seas and Ocean, and of rendring the Air, and its contiguous upper Surface of the Earth extreamly hot and inflam'd, no more, I &s;uppo&s;e, will be nece&s;&s;ary to a general Confla|gration: Or if any more A&s;&s;i&s;tance be afforded by the Pre&s;ence of the Comet, it will be <HI>ex a|bundanti</HI>, and only contribute &s;till the more cer|tainly, and the more &s;uddenly, to kindle &s;uch a fatal Fire, and &s;o dreadful a Combu&s;tion. Now that both tho&s;e requi&s;ite Conditions for a general Conflagration wou'd be the Con&s;equents of this Pa&s;&s;age of an a&s;cending Comet, is plain and
<PB N="448" REF="554">
evident: For (1.) On the Approach of the Co|met, a va&s;t Tide wou'd ari&s;e in the great Aby&s;s; and by the new, more con&s;iderable, and more violent Elevations thereof into the Protuberances and the Spheroid Surface of the whole, the old Fi&s;&s;ures and Breaches wou'd be open'd again, and not a few new ones generated; not only, as at the Deluge, in the Mountainous or more loo&s;e Columns, extant above the Surface of the Waters of the Globe; but in all Parts, and un|der the Seas and Ocean, as well as in other Pla|ces; which Fi&s;&s;ures mu&s;t immediately &s;wallow up the main Ma&s;s or Bulk of the Waters upon the Face of the Ground, and &s;end 'em to their Fel|low-Waters in the Bowels of the Earth; which was the fir&s;t and principal Step towards a gene|ral Conflagration. And then (2.) The Vapours acquir'd from the Comet's Atmo&s;phere, which at the Deluge were, by rea&s;on of their long Ab|&s;ence from the <HI>Sun</HI> in the remote Regions be|yond <HI>Saturn</HI>, pretty cool; at this time mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd, by rea&s;on of their &s;o late and near Ap|proach to the <HI>Sun</HI> about the <HI>Perihelion</HI>, exceeding hot and burning; and that to &s;o extraordinary a Degree, that nothing but the <HI>Idea</HI> of the Mouth of a <HI>Volcano</HI>, ju&s;t belching out immen&s;e Quan|tities of liquid and burning Steams, or Torrents of fiery Matter, can in any mea&s;ure be &s;uitable to the Violence thereof. Imagine therefore, the Earth to pa&s;s through the very middle of this Atmo&s;phere, for 10,000 Miles together, and to bear off with it a <HI>Cylindrical</HI> Column thereof, who&s;e <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> were &s;omewhat larger than a great Circle on the Earth, and who&s;e Altitude were the Number of Miles ju&s;t now mention'd; and then tell me whether the <HI>Air</HI>, and its adjoining uppermo&s;t Region of the Earth, will not be
<PB N="449" REF="555">
&s;ufficiently hot and &s;corching; which was the other Step to the general Conflagration. Be|&s;ides all which, what Quantities of this fiery Exhalation, or Torrent of melted liquid Matter wou'd run down the Fi&s;&s;ures into the Bowels of the Earth, and by joining with the Central hot Steams already there, invigorate them, and accelerate the direful Inflammation; and what piercing and &s;corching fiery Corpu&s;cles the Central Body it &s;elf during its Vicinity, wou'd al&s;o &s;end out; and what an additional Power would thereby be afforded the prevailing Heat, I need not &s;ay. Upon the whole, I may appeal to the Reader,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vid. The|or. l. 3. c. 7, &amp;c.</NOTE> if the Concurrence of all the&s;e external Cau&s;es, to &s;ay nothing here of any internal Di&s;po&s;itions in the Earth, it &s;elf thereto, do not appear abundantly &s;ufficient within a little time to &s;et the World on Fire, and bring on that terrible Confla|gration which both Sacred and Profane Te&s;ti|monies con&s;pire to forewarn us of; and &s;o whether the <HI>Theory of Comets</HI> does not af|ford us almo&s;t as commen&s;urate and compleat an Account of the <HI>future Burning</HI>, as it al|ready has done of the <HI>ancient Drowning</HI> of the Earth.</P>
<Q>XCI. The &s;ame Cau&s;e which will &s;et the World on Fire, will al&s;o cau&s;e great and dreadful <HI>Tides</HI> in the <HI>Seas</HI> and in the <HI>Ocean</HI>: with no le&s;s Agitati|ons, Concu&s;&s;ions, and <HI>Earthquakes</HI> in the <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI>.</Q>
<P N="91">XCI. Seeing the Eruption of the Central Heat, (the Cau&s;e, 'tis probable, of all our Earthquakes,) the Pre&s;ence of a Comet; (the Cau&s;e once already of the mo&s;t prodigious

<Q>XCII.

<Q>XCIII. The <HI>Deluge</HI> and <HI>Conflagration</HI> are referr'd, by ancient Tradition, to great Conjunctions of the
<PB N="451" REF="557">
Heavenly Bodies; as both depending on, and hap|pening at the &s;ame.</Q>
<P N="93">XCIII. In our Accounts of the Deluge and Conflagration, there is a notable Conjunction of the Heavenly Bodies indeed; not &s;uch an Imaginary one as the A&s;trologers &s;o ridicu|lou&s;ly make a &s;tir about; the bare Po&s;ition of two or more of the Cele&s;tial Bodies in or near the &s;ame &s;treight Line, from the Eye of the Spectator, while they are at the mo&s;t remote Di&s;tances from one another; which is a poor jejune Thing indeed: But a real one with a Witne&s;s; when Three of the Heavenly Bodies, the Earth, the Moon, and the Comet, not on|ly are in an A&s;trological Heliocentrick Con|junction, or only &s;eem to an Eye in the Sun to be conjoin'd together, but are really &s;o near as to have the mightie&s;t Effects and Influences on one another po&s;&s;ible; which we have &s;uffi|ciently &s;hewn in the pre&s;ent <HI>Theory</HI>, and which does peculiarly corre&s;pond to the Phaenomenon before us.</P>
<P>Corollary. <HI>Tis not impo&s;&s;ible but the ancient Tradition, that the Deluge and Conflagration &s;ome way depended on certain remarkable Conjunctions of the Heavenly Bodies, mi&s;under&s;tood, and after|ward precariou&s;ly and widely mi&s;apply'd, might give Occa&s;ion and Ri&s;e to</HI> A&s;trology; <HI>or to that mighty Quoil and Pother &s;o many in all Ages have made about the</HI> Conjunctions, Oppo&s;itions, <HI>and</HI> A&s;pects <HI>of the Heavenly Bodies, and the</HI> Judicia|ry <HI>Predictions therefrom; which even the Improve|ments of &s;olid Philo&s;ophy in our Age have not been able yet to bani&s;h wholly from among us; the
<PB N="452" REF="558">
Occa&s;ion whereof is otherwi&s;e exceeding dark and unaccountable.</HI></P>
<Q>XCIV. This general Conflagration is not to extend to the entire Di&s;&s;olution or De&s;truction of the Earth, but only to the Alteration, Melioration, and pecu|liar Di&s;po&s;ition thereof into a New State, proper to receive tho&s;e Saints and Martyrs for its Inhabi|tants, who are at the fir&s;t Re&s;urrection to enter, and to live and reign a Thou&s;and Years upon it, till the &s;econd Re&s;urrection, the general Judgment, and the final Con&s;ummation of all Things.</Q>
<P N="94">XCIV. Seeing the Aby&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of a den&s;e and compact Fluid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. 68. cum Co|rol. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> not capable of any Rare|faction or Di&s;&s;olution by the mo&s;t violent Heat imaginable, 'tis evident that the Cau&s;es here a&s;&s;igned can only extend to the upper Orb, or habitable Earth, without any farther Progre&s;s. So that the Effect of this Conflagrati|on will be the Reduction of this upper Earth, and its Atmo&s;phere, into a confus'd, mixt, and Chaotick State; much &s;uch an one as was before ob&s;erv'd to have preceded the Original Forma|tion of it. So that as the Heat decrea&s;es, 'tis but rea&s;onable to expect a kind of Reiteration of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Six Days Creation, or a Renovation of the Primitive State of the Earth; to the De|&s;cription of which therefore I mu&s;t refer the Reader.</P>
<Q>XCV. The State of Nature during the <HI>Millennium</HI> will be very different from that at pre&s;ent, and more agreeable to the <HI>Antediluvian, Primitive</HI> and <HI>Paradi|&s;iacal</HI> ones.</Q>
<P N="95">XCV. This is apparent from the Conclu&s;ion of the former <HI>Solution</HI>.</P>
<Q><PB N="453" REF="559">XCVI. The Earth in the <HI>Millennium</HI> will be without a Sea, or any large Receptacle filled with mighty Collections and Quantities of Waters.</Q>
<P N="96">XCVI. The Primitive Seas depended main|ly on Two Things; the former,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Solut. 6, &amp; 7. pri&ugrave;s.</NOTE> the concur|rence of the Central and Solar Heat for no le&s;s than Nine or Ten Months together, in the Ele|vation of &s;ufficient Quantities of Vapours: The latter, the Earth's con&s;iderable Solidity attain'd before the de&s;cent of the &s;ame Vapours which were to compo&s;e the Seas, of which we are &s;pea|king: So that if either of the&s;e be wanting in this reiterated Formation of the Earth, 'tis evident the Effect mu&s;t fail, and the <HI>Globe</HI> be no longer a <HI>Terraqueous</HI> one after the Conflagration. Now the next Propo&s;ition but one, a&s;&s;erting the Pro|bability of the entire Ab&s;ence of the Sun, mu&s;t infer a Probability of the entire Ab&s;ence of Seas al&s;o, according as this Propo&s;ition a&s;&s;erts.</P>
<Q>XCVII. The Earth in the <HI>Millennium</HI> will have no Succe&s;&s;ion of Light and Darkne&s;s; Day and Night; but a perpetual Day.</Q>
<P N="97">XCVII. In ca&s;e the Earth's Diurnal Rotati|on, upon which the&s;e Vici&s;&s;itudes depend, were retarded &s;o as to be only exactly equal and commen&s;urate to its Annual Motion, (which is the Ca&s;e in the Moon's Diurnal and Men|&s;trual Revolution at pre&s;ent, as we have be|fore ob&s;erv'd,) the Earth would con&s;tantly ex|po&s;e the &s;ame Hemi&s;phere to the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lem. 42. prius.</NOTE> (as the Moon does now to the Earth,) and all Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of Day and Night for ever cea&s;e; the
<PB N="454" REF="560">
one half of the Globe enjoying a perpetual Day, while the other was involv'd in Darkne&s;s, or excluded all Advantages from him, and thereby enduring a continual Night, &s;o far as natural Cau&s;es are here to be con&s;ider'd. And that this Retardation of the Earth's Diurnal Rotation (even without a recurring to the miraculous Power of its fir&s;t Author) is accountable from that pa&s;&s;ing by of a Comet, which we a&s;&s;ign for the Occa&s;ion of the Conflagration, is very ea&s;y and obvious: For in ca&s;e its A&s;cent and Pa&s;&s;age by, be on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Side, or before the Earth; and in ca&s;e it approach &s;o near as to rub again&s;t it, 'tis evident &s;uch an Impul&s;e is contrary to the cour&s;e of the Diurnal Rotation, and is therefore capable (the Proportions of every Thing being adju&s;ted by Divine Providence) of putting &s;uch a Stop to the &s;ame as is nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ent Phaenomenon, and &s;o may put a Period to that con&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion of Light and Darkne&s;s, Day and Night, which has obtain'd ever &s;ince the Fall of Man; and withal di&s;tingui&s;h the Surface of the Earth into two quite different and contrary Hemi&s;pheres; near the <HI>Vertex</HI> of one of which the Sun it &s;elf, and near that of the other, its oppo&s;ite Point in the Heavens, will be always &s;ituate.</P>
<P>Corollary. <HI>Seeing &s;uch a Rub of the Comet would affect the Annual Motion of the Earth as well as the Diurnal, 'tis po&s;&s;ible it might retard the former as well as the latter, and reduce the</HI> Elliptical <HI>Cour&s;e and Orbit of the Earth, to its ancient Circular one again, or into &s;ome other</HI> Elliptical <HI>one of a very different</HI> Species <HI>from the pre&s;ent</HI>.</P>
<Q><PB N="455" REF="561">XCVIII. The State of the <HI>Millennium</HI> will not &s;tand in need of, and &s;o probably will be without, the Light and Pre&s;ence of the Sun and Moon.</Q>

'Tis but ju&s;t, &s;ure, to depend upon the Veracity of tho&s;e Holy Writers in other A&s;&s;ertions, who&s;e Fide|lity is &s;o entirely e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the&s;e hitherto equally unaccountable ones.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> The Obvious, Plain, or Literal Sen&s;e of the Sacred Scriptures, ought not, without great Rea&s;on, to be eluded or laid a&s;ide: Several of tho&s;e very Places which &s;eem'd very much to require the &s;ame hitherto, appearing now to the minute&s;t Circum&s;tances, true and rational; according to the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t literal Interpretations of them.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> We may be under an Obligation to believe &s;uch Things on the Authority of the Holy Scriptures as are properly <HI>My&s;teries</HI>; that is, though not really <HI>Contradictory,</HI> yet plainly <HI>Unaccountable</HI> to our <HI>(pre&s;ent Degree of)</HI> Knowledge and Rea&s;on. Thus the Sacred Hi&s;tories of the <HI>Original Con&s;titution,</HI> and great <HI>Cata&s;trophes</HI> of the World, have ju&s;tly been in the pa&s;t Ages the Objects of the Faith of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> though the Divine Providence had not afforded &s;o much Light, as that they could otherwi&s;e &s;atisfy them&s;elves in the Credibility of them, till the new Improvements in <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI>. And this is but ju&s;t and rea&s;onable; for &s;ure the Ignorance or Incapacity of the Creature does by no means afford &s;ufficient Ground for Incredulity, or ju&s;tify Men in their rejecting Divine Revelation, and impeaching the Veracity or Providence of the Creator.</P>

the &s;ame Author has indited tho&s;e Writings which re|late to both; the Di&s;covery of the Verity of the Ho|ly Scriptures in the mo&s;t difficult Points relating to the <HI>one,</HI> ought to make us entirely &s;ecure of the like Ve|rity of the &s;ame Scriptures relating to the <HI>other</HI>; notwith&s;tanding any Difficulties &s;till remaining about them. As the wi&s;e, proportionate, and harmonious Order and Regularity of the Natural World, where no Freedom of the Creature interpo&s;es, and gives any Occa&s;ion for Di&s;order, ju&s;tly obliges us to believe the mo&s;t wi&s;e and equal Methods of Providence to be e|qually exerci&s;ed about the Moral one al&s;o; although the Intricacies ari&s;ing from the Abu&s;e of the Liberty of Will in rational Creatures, render them hitherto more ob&s;cure to us in the latter Ca&s;e than in the for|mer: So certainly the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Verity of the Scriptures in the mo&s;t har&s;h and difficult A&s;&s;erti|ons touching the Natural World, (the proper Ca&s;e in which the Improvement of Philo&s;ophy was likely to afford Means for our Determination,) ought to a&s;&s;ure us of the like Verity of the &s;ame Scriptures in the other Points, more particularly the Subjects of Divine Revelation, le&s;s capable of affording any other Means of Satisfaction, and yet more directly the De&s;ign, Scope, and Drift of the Sacred Writers, and the Concern of Divine Providence than the other.</P>
