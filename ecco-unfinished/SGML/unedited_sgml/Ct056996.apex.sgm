<HEAD>THE TRYAL OF Capt. <HI>Jeane</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE following Narrative being &s;o very remarkable, that per|haps the like never appeared before in this, or any other Na|tion; we therefore concluded it might be acceptable to make it publick. The Vil|lanies of <HI>Bluet, Bunworth,</HI> and their Confederates, are all va&s;tly outdone by the dete&s;table, and before unpracticed Cruelties of the Per&s;on who is the Sub|ject of the&s;e Sheets; even the Barbari|ty of Mrs. <HI>Hayes,</HI> who murdered and mangled her Husband, is more than a thou&s;and Times exceeded.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ons we have mentioned, had &s;omething to &s;ay, in Excu&s;e, for even the
<PB N="2" REF="4">
Part of their Conduct: But here is to be found Wickedne&s;s for the &s;ake of com|mitting it; Barbarity in the mo&s;t perfect Degree; a Murder perpetrated with the horride&s;t Circum&s;tances that could po&s;|&s;ibly attend a Murder; and all without &s;o much as the Shadow of a Rea&s;on for it. Here is a poor Creature de&s;troyed by mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Tortures, without &s;o much as de&s;erving any Puni&s;hment; only by be|ing in the Power of a Wretch deve&s;ted entirely of Humanity, he falls a Sacrifice to the mo&s;t unbounded Rage that Man could practice, or Hell could infu&s;e.</P>
<P>This Action will become the A&s;toni&s;h|ment and Abhorrence of future Genera|tions, as much as 'tis of the pre&s;ent. 'Twas not to be imagined that a Child, &s;o young as the unhappy Sufferer, could be capable of rai&s;ing &s;o &s;trong a Re&s;ent|ment in the Mind of a Man, till this undeniable In&s;tance appeared to the con|trary. The Nature of the whole Tran&s;|action is in it&s;elf &s;o mon&s;terou&s;ly and de|te&s;tably cruel and wicked, that, tho' the Captain has many Friends, who, upon a le&s;s criminal Ca&s;e, might have been very &s;er|viceable to him, not one of them would &s;o much as attempt to beg Mercy for him, or ask even for a Reprieve.</P>
<P>That which added, if any Thing could do &s;o, to the Abhorrence People had en|tertained
<PB N="3" REF="5">
of the Man and his Conduct, was a mo&s;t remarkable An&s;wer he gave, when being ask'd, at his Tryal, what could induce him to &s;o much Cruelty; <HI>he &s;aid,</HI> 'Twas what he took Plea&s;ure in; Words, 'tis believed, never &s;poke before in a Court of Judicature!</P>
<P>The mi&s;erable Object that &s;uffered, was unfortunately taken on board as his Ca|bin-Boy at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> where his unhappy Relations now live. They had educated him &s;uitable to the De&s;ign of putting him to Sea, which they always intended, and he ever &s;eemed to have an Inclination for; and he could read and write as well as was expected of him. He was about eighteen Years old. All the Time he had been on board his Behaviour was dutiful to the Captain. He was diligent and ob|&s;ervant; and, to all Appearance, the Cap|tain was very well &s;atisfied with him; &s;o that it was more &s;urprizing how he could, all of a &s;udden, become exa&s;pe|rated again&s;t him, and entertain that in|veterate Malice, which nothing could &s;a|tisfy but his Blood; and that too, drawn in a more dreadful Way than any Crea|ture in human Shape ever experienced be|fore.</P>
<P>But, in order to be regular, we mu&s;t here give &s;ome &s;hort Account of the Tryal,
<PB N="4" REF="6">
and then proceed to the Character and Conduct of the Captain.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the Twenty-fifth of <HI>April</HI> 1726. was held a Se&s;&s;ion of Admiralty at <HI>Ju&s;tice-Hall,</HI> in the <HI>Old Bailey,</HI> before Sir <HI>Henry Penrice</HI> Knt. Doctor of Laws, Lieutenant-Commi&s;&s;ary in the High Court of Admiraly, and Pre&s;ident of the &s;aid Court; and Mr. Baron <HI>Hale,</HI> and others, A&s;&s;ociates in the Commi&s;&s;ion; when Cap|tain <HI>John Jeane</HI> was tried for the Mur|der of his Cabin-Boy in his Voyage from <HI>South Carolina</HI> to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and found Guilty: Upon which he received Sentence of Death as u&s;ual in the like Ca&s;e; and pur&s;uant thereto he was hanged at <HI>Exe|cution-Dock</HI> on <HI>Friday</HI> the Thirteenth of <HI>May,</HI> and is now in Chains over-again&s;t the <HI>King's Powder-Hou&s;e</HI> at <HI>Greenwich.</HI></P>
<P>Five Men, being all he had in the Voy|age, appeared again&s;t him at his Tryal: They were all very po&s;itive in their Evi|dence; and it was rendered mo&s;t credita|ble and &s;trong, by there not being the lea&s;t material Variation in their Depo&s;itions; &s;o that he was convicted upon the fulle&s;t and cleare&s;t Proof that could po&s;&s;ibly&punc; be re|quired. They all &s;wore to the Effect fol|lowing;</P>
<P>That the barbarous Villain, <HI>for no bet|ter be ought to be call'd,</HI> had whipped this
<PB N="5" REF="7">
poor Boy &s;everal Times in a very cruel Manner; and after whipping, pickled him in Brine; that for nine Days and Nights he tied him to the main Ma&s;t, his Arms and Legs being all the Time extended at full Length; that not content with this, he had him unty'd, and laid along upon the Gangway, where he trod upon him, and would have had the Men done the &s;ame, which they refus'd; by which being exa&s;perated as thinking, which indeed he might very well do, that they pitied him, he kick'd him about as he lay, unable to get up, and &s;tamp'd upon his Brea&s;t &s;o vio|lently, that his Excrement came involun|tarily from him; which he took up, and with his own Hands forc'd it &s;everal Times down his Throat; that the poor mi&s;erable Creature was eighteen Days a dying, being cruelly allowed Food enough to &s;u&s;tain Life, and keep him in Torture all that Time; that he was &s;everely whipp'd every Day, and particularly the Day he died; that when he was in the Agonies of Death, and &s;peechle&s;s, his inexorable Ma&s;ter gave him eighteen La&s;hes; that when he was ju&s;t expiring, he put his Finger to his Mouth, which was took for a Signal of de&s;iring &s;omething to drink, when the Brute, to continue his Inhuma|nity to the la&s;t, went into the Cabbin for a Gla&s;s, which he pi&s;&s;ed in, and then gave
<PB N="6" REF="8">
it him for a Cordial; that a little, 'twas be|lieved, went down his Throat; upon which pu&s;hing the Gla&s;s from him, he that In|&s;tant breathed his la&s;t; and God in Mercy put an End to his Sufferings, which &s;eem|ed to cau&s;e an Unea&s;ine&s;s to the Captain for not continuing longer.</P>
<P>They further depos'd, that when the Body was &s;own up in a Hammock to be thrown overboard, it was of as many Co|lours as the Rainbow; that his Fle&s;h was in many Places like Jelly, and his Head &s;wollen as big as two Men's Heads of the large&s;t Size.</P>
<P>As the Evidence met with full Credit, &s;o the Relation of it was mo&s;t &s;hocking to all that heard it; as it mu&s;t undoubted|ly be to every one into who&s;e Hands this Book falls, that has any Remains of Hu|manity or Compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Captain made no manner of De|fence, worth being term'd &s;uch; the Matter was too black and too plain: He only pretended in general to deny the Facts; but as he could get nobody, &s;o much as to &s;upport his Character, or from any one Per&s;on or Circum&s;tance invalidate the lea&s;t Part of the Evidence; tho' there was a &s;mall Appearance for him, the Court paid no more Regard to what he &s;aid, than ought to be paid to it. At the pronouncing Sen|tence, Sir <HI>Henry Pe$rice</HI> &s;aid, that he had never heard of &s;o horrid a Barbarity, and
<PB N="7" REF="9">
hoped &s;uch another would never come be|fore him.</P>
<P>Thus you have a full Relation of a Piece of Villany that never was exceeded, and perhaps may never be equall'd: That which enhaunces the Cruelty of the whole, is, That as this Scene of Barbarity was gradual, &s;o the mo&s;t &s;evere Parts of it were executed, when the mi&s;erable Suffe|rer was lea&s;t capable to bear them.</P>
<P>All, that at the Tryal could be pretend|ed for this U&s;age, be&s;ides what we have already mentioned, amounted to no more than a &s;orry Su&s;picion of the Boy's having taken a little Rum and Sugar belonging to the Captain; which altogether did not come to a Shilling; a Charge &s;o trivial, that future Ages will from it have Cau&s;e to doubt of the Truth of the whole Relation.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t now, &s;ome that would appear on the Behalf of the Captain, tho' they did not think it advi&s;eable to do &s;o at his Try|al, have cook'd up a Story, that for many Days after his Conviction was never heard of; and, indeed, &s;eems only to be the Effect of a &s;udden Imagination: They make round Work with the Witne&s;&s;es, and their Te&s;timony, and tell us that all they &s;aid and &s;wore to was utterly fal&s;e and ground|le&s;s; that they had taken a Pique at the Captain, <HI>who, by the way they acknow|ledge to be a &s;evere Man to his People</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="10">
<HI>when on board;</HI> and they were re&s;olved, &s;ay they, to &s;wear this Matter, which was all exactly concerted and contrived among them&s;elves to take his Life away, for his&punc; not having treated them as they thought they de&s;erved; and as they were thus exa&s;perated again&s;t him, his Blood they were determined to have at all E|vents, and they have had it accordingly.</P>
<P>Having thus fairly &s;tated what they af|firm, we would leave it to the Deci&s;ion of the impartial Reader, whether what the&s;e People &s;ay, is to be believed, before what the others &s;wore; and whether it is probable, or no, that five Men &s;hould &s;o exactly agree in &s;o many minute Cir|cum&s;tances, though examin'd apart, un|le&s;s they were real, and could refre&s;h the$ Memories by a Recollection of the Truth; and whether 'tis likely the&s;e Men could keep their Re&s;entment for the little petty Affronts they pretend, &s;o warm, and &s;o long, as to bring them&s;elves &s;o many Months after the&s;e Facts were done, to commit mo&s;t wilful Perjury, to the de|&s;troying an innocent Man's Life, to the utter bla&s;ting their own Reputations, and perhaps to the eternal Perdition of their own Souls, and all merely to revenge a trivial Injury; and la&s;tly, whether it does not &s;trongly corroborate all the&s;e Witne&s;|&s;es a&s;&s;ert, to find, which the Captain him|&s;elf
<PB N="9" REF="11">
had not the A&s;&s;urance to deny, that the poor Boy died under the inhuman Di&s;ci|pline of his Ma&s;ter: But as it is hardly po&s;&s;ible this improbable Story they &s;pread in Aleviation of the Captain's Crimes, &s;hould meet with any Regard from unpre|judic'd Per&s;ons, we &s;hall &s;pend no more Time to invalidate it&punc; but pa&s;s immediately to Particulars more material.</P>
<P>This Man, if we may call him a Man, who &s;eem'd to be de&s;titute of every good Quality belonging to human Nature, was born at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> of hone&s;t Parents, and at that Time not wealthy; but in a Capacity to live very comfortably: His Father has &s;ince got a very con&s;iderable Competency, and has left off his Bu&s;ine&s;s, which was a &s;ea-faring one, and lives upon his E&s;tate, which they &s;ay, is two hundred a Year: They gave their Son a hand&s;ome Educa|tion, and thereby fitted him for that Bu&s;i|ne&s;s in Life, he has &s;ince been very pro&s;pe|rous in. For many Years he u&s;ed the Sea, being partly brought up under his Fa|ther, and partly to the Trade of a Cooper, which he work'd at when he fir&s;t went to Sea. He was &s;ometime Commander of a Merchant Ship belonging to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> He was upwards of twenty nine Years of Age; and has for a con&s;iderable while been rec|koned by tho&s;e, who had the be&s;t Rea&s;on to know his Circum&s;tances to be worth more
<PB N="10" REF="12">
than &s;ix thou&s;and Pounds, and all his Debts paid; but what Account may now be given of this la&s;t Particular by his Friends, is not very difficult to determine</P>
<P>He was of a moro&s;e re&s;erv'd Temper, and always e&s;teemed an ill-natur'd pa&s;|&s;i$$ate Man. This Di&s;po&s;ition &s;hew'd it|&s;elf much &s;ince his Confinement, and e|&s;pecially &s;ince his Condemnation. Being able to pay for it, he was allow'd the Pri|vilege of the <HI>Pre&s;s-Yard</HI> in <HI>Newgate,</HI> while under Sentence; and as he was re|&s;olv'd to keep him&s;elf private, few or none were admitted to conver&s;e with him, with|out having fir&s;t ask'd his Leave to do it; and it was but to v$ry few, even of the&s;e, that he would &s;ay any Thing relating to the Affair he &s;uffer'd Death for, or admit them to talk to him about it.</P>
<P>He &s;eem'd to have no Notion of entring into any Conver&s;e with the Ordinary of <HI>Newgate,</HI> or any other Mini&s;ter, that might lead him to conf &s;s the Murther, and acknowledge his Guilt; but in a Method &s;omething different from what has lately ap|peared to be the Practice of Per&s;ons in his Circum&s;tances, he endeavour'd to prepare for Death, as not having, as he &s;aid, the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to expect a Delive|rance from it; and this Preparation con|&s;i&s;ted much in Generals. He &s;aid he had been a great Sin$er, and mo&s;t heartily asked God's Pardon; that he was &s;incerely
<PB N="11" REF="13">
&s;orry for the Offences of his Life, and hoped for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t he &s;hould be received to Mercy, and &s;aved. He &s;hew'd indeed a &s;ettled con&s;tant Concern for &s;eve|ral Days before his Execution; but the mo&s;t that could be got from him, during that outward Sign of Penitence, was, That <HI>if</HI> his Management of his Cabbin-Boy was a Sin, he begg'd and hop'd God would forgive him that, among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed very unea&s;y at the Thoughts of being to be hung in Chains, and often exclaim'd again&s;t it in very pathetick Terms: One Day particularly he &s;aid, he look'd upon it to be very hard Treat|ment, &s;uch as he had not de&s;erv'd, and that it was not u&s;ing him like a Gentle|man: But in this mo&s;t People differed very widely from him, looking upon no Pu|ni&s;hment our Laws allow, adequate to his Crimes; and that Nothing co$ d have been more &s;uitable to his De$e$ts, than to have been put to Death by the like Torture and Di&s;tre&s;s he inflicted on his murder'd Ser|vant.</P>
<P>Had he &s;een any Body coming to his Apartment, and did not like their Ap|pearance, he would &s;hut his Chamber Door again&s;t them, and not allow them to come in, tho' he had before given Leave for their Admittance.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
All the Per&s;ua&s;ions that could be us'd, were in&s;ufficient to prevail with him to quit the Company of a Gentlewoman, who continued with him all the Time he lay in <HI>Newgate,</HI> as &s;he had done it &s;eems for &s;everal Months before he came there. This Gentlewoman went by the Name of <HI>Parker;</HI> but was not at this Time own'd for his Wife.</P>
<P>But no Con&s;iderations would avail: His Affection for her, was not to be alienated; and he continued to alleviate the Unea&s;i|ne&s;s of his Thoughts by diverting him&s;elf with this Woman, even to the very Night before he was to die. He look'd upon him&s;elf as under great Obligations to her for the Attempt to &s;erve him at his Tryal; and tho' &s;he could &s;ay but very little, yet what &s;he did &s;ay, was more on his Behalf than what was produc'd by any other Per|&s;on; tho', 'tis thought, if the Court had been at all acquainted with the Character of the Woman, and e&s;pecially the Intimacy there was between them, her Evidence had gone for much le&s;s than it did.</P>
<P>'Twas to this Per&s;on the keeping him|&s;elf &s;o re&s;erv'd, was chiefly owing; and 'tis believ'd &s;he prevented his making Confe&s;&s;ion, &s;he being always in the Room with him; and not caring People &s;hould &s;ee her there, &s;he oblig'd him to &s;hut the
<PB N="13" REF="15">
Door, as is mention'd before, again&s;t tho&s;e that came to vi&s;it him; and oftentimes &s;he did it her&s;elf; which he &s;ubmitted to, not allowing any to come near him, but whom &s;he approv'd of.</P>
<P>The Reverend Ordinary endeavour'd to the utmo&s;t to bring him to a right Sen&s;e of Things, and a Temper &s;uitable to his Condition; but it &s;ignify'd very lit|tle: He treated him with good Manners, would hear all he &s;aid very patiently, with|out offering any Interruption, but would give him no manner of An&s;wer. He &s;eem'd to be of a &s;ettled Di&s;po&s;ition, as if he had done but little ami&s;s; there did not to the la&s;t appear any great Alteration in him, nothing like what 'twas rea&s;onable to expect in a Man who was a&s;&s;ured, as he him&s;elf &s;aid, in &s;o &s;hort a Time to end his Life, by a violent ignominious Death: The mo&s;t he could get him to come into, was to allow of Prayers, which he con&s;tantly read to him in his Chamber twice every Day; at the&s;e he behaved with the Decency that is u&s;ual to a Man of Sen&s;e in Times of De|votion, but not at all more affected than ordinarily: He de&s;ir'd to be prayed for as a Sinner, but would as yet make no particu|lar Confe&s;&s;ion of any one Crime; and when pre&s;s'd with that for which he was to &s;uffer, he never made any other Reply,
<PB N="14" REF="16">
but that, If that was his wor&s;t Fault, 'twould be well for him.</P>
<P>Mr. Ordinary told him he could not encourage him to expect or hope that God would pardon his pa&s;t Mi&s;carriages, while he lived in the wilful Practice of Sin; and thereupon renew'd his Intrea|ties to him, that if he had any Value for his immortal Soul, not to allow the Gentle|woman, we have mentioned, to come any longer to his Bed: But this &s;ignify'd no more than his former Soli$i$ations had done; all he got in return, was to de&s;ire him to leave that Part of his Conduct to him&s;elf, and to go on to read Prayers with him as u&s;ual; which being the mo&s;t he could bring him to, he was oblig'd to acquie&s;s.</P>
<P>Certainly no Man of his Sen&s;e and Ca|pacity, that pretended to believe and pro|fe&s;s the Chri&s;tian Religion, ever made &s;o unaccountable a Preparation for &s;o fa|tal a Cata&s;trophe&punc; if he made any at all, as this unhappy Man: His whole Con|duct &s;poke it, and therefore we may re|peat it; he &s;eemed to be de&s;irous indeed that God would pardon and &s;ave him; but that if he would not do &s;o upon his own Terms, he would run the Ri&s;que of Salvation and Happine&s;s, and take his Lot in the future State, as it might hap|pen.
<PB N="15" REF="17">
Thus no E&s;&s;ays could move him to give up &s;o much as one Iudulgence; and if nothing would do without owning the the Guilt of particular Facts, and aban|doning the Object of his Affection, he was re&s;olved to hazard all, rather than com|ply; &s;o that in a Word, he went out of the World in&s;en&s;ible, to all Appearance, of his Crime; and from what was then thought wanton and unlawful Embraces, ventur'd upon Eternity; and how it would fare with him there, he &s;eemed as uncer|tain, as much at a Lo&s;s, and indeed, as regardle&s;s, as ever Man could be, who had at the &s;ame Time the full U&s;e of his Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>We are told, indeed, that notwith&s;tand|ing all his Pretences to the contrary, and the many repea$ed publick A&s;&s;evera|tions he made, that he expected no Mercy, yet, to the la&s;t, he &s;ecretly cheri&s;hed the Hopes of having his Life &s;pared; for which 'tis &s;aid, he was willing to have parted with all he had in the World: But the Fact was of &s;o &s;hocking a Nature, that nothing but his &s;uffering Death could po&s;&s;ibly be the I&s;&s;ue of it, when|ever he fell into the Hands of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The only Incident which &s;eem'd to give him any Shock, was the Appearance of the Smith, who came to view his Body on the <HI>Saturday</HI> before he died, in order to
<PB N="16" REF="18">
make the Iron Work for his hanging in Chains: This alter'd the Appearance of his Countenance, and made him much unea&s;y all the Time the Smith &s;tay'd; which, tho' it was but a little while, might yet have been le&s;s, and not taken Notice of neither, had his Female Companion been le&s;s officious in the Matter; for &s;he &s;tood up before the Captain, who &s;et upon a low Chair, and throwing open the two Sides of her Night Gown, endeavour'd to prevent the Smith's &s;eeing him, tho', at the &s;ame Time, telling him upon what Account he came. At la&s;t &s;he was forced to &s;ubmit; &s;o that had it not been for her, the Captain had known nothing of the De&s;ign of &s;uch a Vi&s;it, nor could he have &s;u&s;pected it to have been any other than the Effect of the Man's Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>He was taken very ill two Days before his Execution, and not without &s;trong Su&s;|picion of his having enter'd upon a Me|thod to prevent his being made a publick Specta$le of; but if that was fact, either his Friends, or his Heart fail'd him, for the Preparation only &s;erved to make his Exit more mi&s;erable, he being &s;o very &s;ick and weak, that they were obliged to bring him upon Men's Shoulders from the Cart to the Scaffold; and when there, he was unable even to &s;et upright, and lay all along upon his Back with his Face co|vered
<PB N="17" REF="19">
with his Hat during the whole Time the Mini&s;ter was performing his Of|fices. He was attended by two Mini&s;ters, but one only a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his la&s;t Mo|ments.</P>
<P>The Crowd to &s;ee him die, was very nu|merous, tho' &s;omething le&s;s for Fear of the Pre&s;s-Gangs, who were very diligent, and made the be&s;t U&s;e of that Opportu|nity. An univer&s;al Satisfaction &s;eemed to appear in the Countenance of the Behol|ders; and the Sen&s;e they had of the Bar|barity of his Crime, occa&s;ioned his dy|ing as unpitied, tho' he was in great Di&s;|tre&s;s by his Illne&s;s, as perhaps ever Man did, <HI>Jonathan Wilde</HI> him&s;elf not except|ed. Mrs. <HI>Pye,</HI> the Mother of the poor murther'd Youth, was a Witne&s;s to his Execution; &s;he was treated with Regard by all who &s;et round her, and every one, when told who &s;he was, expre&s;s'd their Concern for her.</P>
<P>The near Approach of Death made &s;ome Alteration in his Temper, tho' nothing yet equal to what was expected: He with his Dying, and almo&s;t la&s;t Breath, &s;olemn|ly declar'd, as he was to an&s;wer it at the Bar of the Almighty God, before whom he &s;aid he was &s;en&s;ible he was in a few Moments to appear, that Mrs. <HI>Parker,</HI> the Gentlewoman who was Witne&s;s for him at his Tryal, and with whom he had
<PB N="18" REF="20">
convers'd during his Confinement, was his lawful wedded Wife. A few Minutes before he was turn'd off, he delivered a Paper to Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> the High Con&s;ta|ble, who after reading it to the Populace, gave it to Mr. <HI>Applebee</HI> the Printer; the Sub&s;tance of which is in&s;erted in this Re|lation, as it is al&s;o in Mr. <HI>Applebee</HI>'s week|ly Journal of Saturday la&s;t, being the fourteenth In&s;tant.</P>
<P>But before we enter upon that Account, allow us to give the Town &s;ome other Particulars, which it may not be di&s;agree|able to make publick.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> has &s;hewn a very laudable Zeal in pro&s;ecuting this Criminal, being convinc'd he was one of the vile&s;t of Offenders: They have &s;pared no Co&s;t to bring him to Ju&s;tice; and in the Cour&s;e of the Proceedings, it has &s;tood them in two hundred Pounds at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho' this Expence was con&s;iderable, yet it was far &s;hort of what it co&s;t the Captain, in his fruitle&s;s Attempts to pro|cure his Pardon; we being a&s;&s;ur'd, if we may take his own Word for it, that he laid out above a thou&s;and Pounds in one Week, &s;ince his receiving Sentence, to prevent the putting of it in Execution.</P>
<P>The&s;e Applications prov'd all ineffectu|al, as the Event has plainly &s;hewn: Tho&s;e who were employed to make them,
<PB N="19" REF="21">
&s;unk the Money, knowing it would have been looked upon as an In&s;olence, to have recommended an Affair of &s;o black a Nature to any Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction, or that had any Value for a Character in Life.</P>
<P>After this Di&s;appointment, they tried at a Favour of a much lower &s;ort; and &s;ince they found he mu&s;t go to be execu|ted, they de&s;ired it might not be in the ordinary Way, but that in&s;tead of a Cart he might have a Coach; and even for this, &s;o flu&s;h was their Money, that they would not have &s;crupled an hundred Guineas to have procur'd it: But they were let to un|der&s;tand, that even this Reque&s;t would not be granted him, tho' they would give ten Times that Sum. And we hear a Coach will not be allow'd to any Malefactor for the future, unle&s;s upon a mo&s;t extraordi|nary Occa&s;ion indeed; for a Coach pre|vents the Criminal from being expos'd to publick View, &s;o much as he de&s;erves; and therefore tho&s;e who come under that Denomination, will not be &s;o far indulg'd in Time to come.</P>
<P>He lived in a very elegant Manner in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and &s;eem'd to deny him&s;elf no Satisfaction that could be receiv'd from eating and drinking: His Habit there was equal to what any Gentleman is u&s;ually &s;een in abroad, and might rather be cal|led
<PB N="20" REF="22">
fine, than otherwi&s;e: This was entirely laid a&s;ide on the Day of Execution; &s;o that his dirty Linnen and mean Apparel &s;eem'd to be an Indication of his Wretchedne&s;s; and from an ill Ca&s;t with his Eyes, pecu|liar to him&s;elf, he altogether look'd like what the People &s;aid, tho' in har&s;her Terms, a Man de&s;erving his Fate.</P>
<P>If we may take the Opinion of the Exe|cutioner, who in the&s;e Ca&s;es is generally allow'd to be a good Judge, he to the la&s;t maintain'd a Temper very unfit for a dy|ing Man; for, according to <HI>Jack</HI>'s Judg|ment, he was &s;ullen to his late&s;t Moment, and went off in an ill Humour.</P>
<P>If we may believe the publick, this is not the fir&s;t In&s;tance he has given of the barbarous Cruelty of his Nature, he ha|ving puni&s;h'd &s;everal with a much more than ordinary Severity; and particularly, that he once cut a Piece of Fle&s;h out of the In&s;ide of a Boy's Thumb, making an Orifice as low as the Bone, and two In|ches round, which he fill'd up with Salt, to torture him for &s;ome very &s;mall Offence he was chargeable with. Many other In|&s;tances are &s;poken of; but as the World is inclinable enough to add upon the&s;e Oc|ca&s;ions&punc; more than can be made appear, we have declined in&s;erting any more; nor indeed is there any need to give Mankind more than the Treatment of his Cabbin-Boy,
<PB N="21" REF="23">
to convince them, that he certainly was one of the mo&s;t inexorable Wretch|es that ever breathed.</P>
<P>'Twill be proper here, if we mention it at all, to record &s;omething of the Conduct of the well-known Mr. <HI>Ketch:</HI> He &s;earch|ed the Pockets of the Deceas'd with his u&s;ual Accuracy and Care; but to his no little Concern he found &s;omebody had been very particular in their Enquiries before him: This &s;ettled the Mu&s;cles of <HI>Jack</HI>'s Face, much more than the di&s;charging the Duty of his Office could do; and find|ing the Crowd began to take Notice of his looking very &s;illy, to maintain his Ground, and &s;upport his Reputation with his old Friends, with a very good Grace, &s;aid, he was a mean &s;pirited Rogue; and if he had thought he &s;hould have been no bet|ter paid for it, he would not have done the Jobb for him.</P>
<P>But to enter upon the more &s;olemn Part, which, as he grew nearer his End, was &s;omewhat more &s;o, and affecting, than it had been; which, as it engag'd tho&s;e that were Witne&s;&s;es to it, &s;o undoubtedly it will tho&s;e that read it: He appear'd in great Agonies the Day before he was to die, and tho&s;e were &s;o far from leaving him, that they gradually encreas'd till the Ago|nies of Death put a Period to them: But neither the&s;e, nor even the View of the fa|tal
<PB N="22" REF="24">
Tree join'd with the utmo&s;t Endeavours of his Friends, could induce him to ac|knowledge the Ju&s;tice of his Sentence, or the Guilt of the particular Fact, for which he &s;uffered: He in&s;i&s;ted to the la&s;t, that he could not apprehend it criminal in him to puni&s;h the Boy; and that his dying un|der Correction, was the Lad's Misfor|tune, but not a Crime chargeable upon him.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Particular, with what is &s;ub|&s;equent to this, is the Sub&s;tance of the Pa|per, deliver'd to Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> the High Con|&s;table, which we thought might be more agreeable to the Reader, to have it with Connexion, than if 'twas tran&s;mitted in the Method in&s;erted in the Paper it&s;elf; which appear'd to be the Compo&s;ition of a Man under much Con&s;ternation. If in relating the Account he gives of him&s;elf, any Thing comes in again that has been touch'd upon before, we de&s;ire it may be look'd upon as what we are oblig'd to, that the Con|nexion may be pre&s;erv'd, and as a Confir|mation of tho&s;e particular Incidents: In the Paper deliver'd to the High Con&s;table, he &s;ays, That he was 29 Years of Age, born in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> of hone&s;t Parents, and People re&s;pected: He had good Educa|tion &s;uitable to his Birth, being taught <HI>Latin,</HI> Writing, Arithmetick, Book-keep|ing, and &s;uch other Things as are proper
<PB N="23" REF="25">
to fit a Man for Bu&s;ine&s;s; and was al&s;o well grounded and in&s;tructed in the Prin|ciples of the Chri&s;tian Religion. When of Age, he was put out Apprentice to a Cooper in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> but went to Sea till the Year 1724: He was made Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Burnet</HI> from <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> to <HI>South Caro|lina.</HI></P>
<P>He did not come to Chapel, but kept in a Room by him&s;elf, alledging that there were divers People, who hated, and bore him ill-will; and the Chapel being always crowded with Spectators, who came to &s;ee a great Number of nota|ble Malefactors under Sentence of Death, hedid not de&s;ire to &s;it by them; &s;o likewi&s;e he endeavour'd to &s;hun them whom he &s;uppo&s;ed to be his Enemies, and who, he thought, would in&s;ult over his mo&s;t mi&s;e|rable and calamitous Condition. The main Rea&s;on he gave for keeping him&s;elf altogether retir'd, and &s;hunning the Sight of the People, as if he had been afraid, or a&s;ham'd of being &s;een by any Body, was, that he might apply him&s;elf wholly to his Devotion, and the few Moments of Life allow'd him in the Service of God; for he did not think that he could be &s;o &s;erious amid&s;t &s;o many Malefactors, and others, who, he &s;aid, hated and envied him, and would come on Purpo&s;e to laugh at his Calamity.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="26">
He own'd him&s;elf to have been a great Sinner; but never to have been guilty of any Capital Crime. He &s;aid, that he had been too much liable to the Commi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Sins, which are too commonly in u&s;e among Travellers; that &s;ometimes he had been drunk; that he had committed Whoredom; that he had been too much guilty of Covetou&s;ne&s;s; that he had not been &s;o careful in performance of religious Duties, as he ought to have been, but &s;ometimes had neglected the Ob&s;ervation of the Lord's Day in a due Manner: In &s;hort, he confe&s;s'd that his Conver&s;ation had not been conformable to the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as it &s;hould have been, but more negligent than what was proper in his Duty, both to God and Man; but other|ways, he &s;aid, that he never had been wicked to that Degree, as to be denomi|nated vicious, but that his Failings were &s;uch, as are common to Mankind, and not &s;ubject to the Severity of penal Laws.</P>
<P>As to the particular Fact of murthering his Cabbin-Boy, of which he was con|victed, and for which he was to die&punc; he &s;aid, that he had not murther'd him, and never intended &s;uch a Thing; that the Deceas'd was a very naughty Boy, having frequently broken up &s;everal of his Locks, and &s;tolen Brandy, Rum, and o|ther Provi&s;ions from him, which (as he
<PB N="25" REF="27">
&s;aid) the Boy confe&s;s'd in part before &s;ome other Captains of Ships, who happen'd to be in <HI>South Carolina,</HI> in Company with him&s;elf: That the &s;aid Boy was very naughty, had &s;tolen a number of Things from him; that it was not po&s;&s;ible to re|&s;train him from thevi&s;h Practices; that &s;ome Days after he had been at Sea, bound home to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> in an Evening, or Night, as he was a&s;leep in his Bed in the Cab|bin, the Boy came into it, and having broke open his Locks, and drank above a Pint of his Rum, upon which, he be|came &s;o drunk, that his Excrements went from him, and abus'd the Cabbin fill'd with Goods, rai&s;ing a horrid Stench; that thereupon he awoke, and the Boy was in &s;o di&s;mal a Condition, that he knew not what to do: Upon which, he call'd all the Men of the Ship, excepting tho&s;e who were upon the Watch on Deck, cau&s;ing them to &s;it down, and take a Dram, and &s;moke Tobacco, to remove the intolerable Smell: He ask'd 'em, what &s;uch a Servant de&s;erv'd. However, he &s;aid to them, he would not meddle with him till their Ar|rival in <HI>England;</HI> yet, recollecting him|&s;elf, he thought him&s;elf oblig'd as a Ma&s;ter, to correct a Servant for &s;uch an enormous Fault. And upon this, follow'd the &s;evere Di&s;cipline of tying the Boy to
<PB N="26" REF="28">
the Ma&s;t, with his Arms and Legs &s;tretch'd out, in which Po&s;ture he conti|nued for &s;ome Days and Nights, com|manding not to give him any Meat, either boil'd, roa&s;ted, or fry'd: When he was at the Point of dying, and pa&s;t Speech, making Signs for a Dram, his giving him his own Water in a Gla&s;s, in&s;tead of Rum, his dipping Pieces of of Bread in the Boy's Excrements, which came voluntarily from him, and putting it to the Boy's Mouth, to make him eat it, both which the Boy rejected, he could not di&s;own, only deny'd that he &s;ent him Pi&s;s, but the be&s;t Rum in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> for a Dram. He &s;aid, that there was no evil De&s;ign in what he did; and that if he had done as they &s;wore, the Men who appear'd as Evidences again&s;t him, were Rogues that they did not hinder him, &s;uch Barbarity appearing more like a mad Man, than any Thing el&s;e; adding that the Boy's Mother, who was a Woman of a very ill Nature and indifferent Character, was the only Pro&s;ecutor, his Father, a Journyman Black&s;mith in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> having declared to him, that he would have nothing to do in the Affair; and that the Mate and Sai|lors, who were Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him, had (upon &s;ome Di&s;obligations and Differences) confederated to ruin him. He &s;aid, that
<PB N="27" REF="29">
he was content to die, and had made Prepa|rations for Death accordingly; that he ac|knowledg'd the Ju&s;tice of his Sentence, with re&s;pect to the Honourable Judges and the Jury; but that the Evidence had not done him Ju&s;tice: However, he freely forgave them wherein they had injur'd him, affirming al&s;o, that he never pray|ed to God for him&s;elf, but that he did likewi&s;e mo&s;t earne&s;tly pray for them, &amp;c. Some Days before the Execution, he fell into a very ill State of Health, &s;o that his Sen&s;es fail'd, and frequently fell into Fits; &s;ome &s;u&s;pecting that he had taken Poi&s;on. This was in&s;inuated to him: He &s;aid God forbid that &s;uch a wicked Purpo&s;e &s;hould enter into his Brea&s;t; his Wife al&s;o taking God to witne&s;s, &s;aid, that &s;he never gave him any Thing but what was whol&s;ome, and that &s;he lov'd him too well to be his Executioner. He became &s;o weak and feve|ri&s;h, that he did not de&s;ire Exhortations, as not needing In&s;tructions for the Direction of Life, which he look'd upon as pa&s;t, but godly Prayers, or &s;hort Admonitions; withal, de&s;iring to direct him to &s;ome pro|per Place in the Go&s;pel, fit to guard again&s;t De&s;pair. Upon the Wedne&s;day before he died, &s;everal Chapters in the Bible were read to him, at which he fainted three or four Times. This was look'd upon the
<PB N="28" REF="30">
Effect of his Illne&s;s, rather than Contri|tion; and after this he was &s;o very weak, that he could not li&s;ten to any Thing read or &s;poke by any Body, but de&s;ir'd devout Prayers to God for his Soul. He very of|ten declar'd, that had he been to live any longer in this World, he had by God's Grace attain'd to &s;uch a perfect Re&s;igna|tion and Contempt of all earthly E$joy|ments, that he &s;hould e&s;teem the World, and all the Plea&s;ures thereof, no more than the Dirt of the Streets. The Reverend Mr. <HI>Bedford</HI> (upon his De&s;ire) frequently vi&s;ited him, and gave him the Sacrament; the Captain expre&s;s'd him&s;elf very grate|ful for his Kindne&s;s. He died in the Faith of Chri&s;t, owning him&s;elf an unworthy Member of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and declaring that he was in Peace with all Mankind. <HI>Thus far his own Account.</HI></P>
<P>He was unaccountably hurry'd in his Mind the Night before his Execution, and by &s;udden Starts, and unconnected Ex|pre&s;&s;ions, &s;hew'd the dreadful Affright of his Soul: His Imagination, 'tis &s;aid, pre|&s;ented even the murther'd Boy to his View in all the Agonies of Death, and he cry'd out like a Man di&s;tracted; but much of this was attributed to his Indi&s;po&s;ition, for, upon his growing calmer, he appear'd
<PB N="29" REF="31">
no more concern'd for the particular Fact for which he &s;uffer'd, than he had done be|fore.</P>
<P>He took but little Care to requite tho&s;e who had been &s;erviceable to him &s;ince his Condemnation, and the A&s;&s;urances he had given to &s;ome upon that Account, pa&s;s'd altogether uncomply'd with.</P>
<P>The parting with the Gentlewoman, who we mu&s;t now call his Wife, was ve|ry moving; that, and the taking Leave of his Friends, &s;pent a con&s;iderable Part of the Morning till ten of the Clock, all po&s;&s;ible Endearments pa&s;s'd between them, and it &s;eem'd wor&s;e than Death to each of of them, that they mu&s;t meet no more: Abundance of Tears were &s;hed on all Sides, and the Unea&s;ine&s;s it cau&s;ed to him&s;elf par|ticularly, threw him into Convul&s;ions. As he was to be hung in Chains, his Rela|tions and Friends all left him at <HI>Newgate;</HI> and he came unaccompany'd to the Water-Side by all his Acquaintance, but tho&s;e who were become &s;o, by belonging to the Pri&s;on. The Mob in&s;ulted him by different Methods as he pa&s;s'd the Streets, and by &s;aluting him often with Huzza's, te&s;tify'd the Satisfaction they had in his Sufferings.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32">
He expre&s;s'd a great Concern for his Father, who, he fear'd, would break his Heart as &s;oon as he had the Account of his untimely &s;hameful End; and, for this, he &s;eem'd to &s;hew as much Sorrow, or ra|ther more, than he did for his own Ca&s;e: All the Calamity he &s;aid the Family ever met with, was brought down upon them by his Indi&s;cretion, and he griev'd the more, becau&s;e 'twas out of his Po$$$ to make them any Reparation.</P>
<P>He could not, at the la&s;t, be brought to &s;peak well of Mrs. <HI>Pye,</HI> who, he &s;aid, was the Cau&s;e of all his Di&s;a&s;ters: Her Husband, he &s;aid, was as good a Man as liv'd; and he did not doubt, but he would have made the Matter up, and have forgiven him, but that his Wife pre|vented it; &s;o that, as he term'd it, her Son died by Accident, but &s;he had wilfully &s;ought and taken his Blood; which, he thought, very hard and unju&s;t. But here he was certainly as much mi&s;taken, as ever he had been before; for it plainly appears, that neither Mrs. <HI>Pye,</HI> nor her Husband, would have accepted of any Con&s;idera|tion, though it had been all the Captain could have offer'd in the World, as an Attonement for the Blood of their Son, who had been ba&s;ely and mo&s;t cru|elly murder'd. They knew nothing could
<PB N="31" REF="33">
be &s;atisfactory to God, or Man, but the Blood of the Murtherer; therefore they would not &s;ell the Blood of their inno|cent Child, nor have the Guilt of &s;hed|ding it lie at their Door; and this is what they have mo&s;t &s;olemnly declared on all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>But to view the Captain in his la&s;t Appearance, preparing for his fatal <HI>Exit:</HI> They favour'd his Indi&s;po&s;ition as much as po&s;&s;ible, and the Cart mov'd but &s;low|ly thro' the Streets: However, being all upon the Stones, it &s;hook him &s;o much, that 'twas fear'd the People and Exe|cutioner would have been di&s;appointed&punc; Arriving at the Place, he reviv'd a little, and having &s;et &s;till in the Cart &s;ometime, they convey'd him, as has been mention'd, from that to the Scaffold. At fir&s;t, he &s;et, and two Men &s;upported him; when ca&s;t|ing his Eyes around, tho' without look|ing directly in any Man's Face, which 'twas taken Notice of he carefully a|voided, he found an Appearance that was far from being agreeable to him; the People expre&s;s'd nothing of a friendly Concern for him, and he was &s;oon very &s;en&s;ible of it: Upon this, he threw him|&s;elf upon his Back, and never look'd upon the Company more. He ask'd for a little Water, which, by his Direction, had
<PB N="32" REF="34">
been provided for him by one of the Offi|cers in a Viol; of this, he took a &s;mall Sup, and then applied him&s;elf to his De|votions; which, 'twas ob&s;erv'd by the Company, Sailors di&s;patch much &s;ooner than any other People. And, indeed, it was &s;o here, the Whole being over in a little more than a quarter of an Hour; and yet he had as much Time allow'd him, as to perform all the appointed Service, and as much as he &s;eem'd to de&s;ire for his more private Prayers and Ejaculations, which were &s;till much &s;horter than the other. He repeated every Word after the Mini&s;ter, and &s;eemingly with abun|dance of Earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;aying all the Time upon his Back, as has been ob&s;erv'd, and his Face cover'd with his Hat. And now the Mini&s;ters taking their leave of him, and the People having Notice to get off the Scaffold, gave him a great Alarm, as it well might: His Agonies now began indeed; he lifted up his Hands and Eyes in a mo&s;t moving Manner, and cry'd to God for Mercy, with the utmo&s;t Ve|hem$ncy imaginable: He was all Agony, and his Convul&s;ions were now much grea|ter than ever they had been. But even all this brought him to no particular Con|fe&s;&s;ion of the Fact he died for; his In|difference and Ea&s;ine&s;s of Temper, was
<PB N="33" REF="35">
now at an End, and he was all Con&s;ter|nation and Amazement: He cry'd out once or twice, God's Will be done! God's Will be done! but &s;ure no Man could enter in|to another World with more Fear and Dread upon him, of what might be the Con&s;equence of &s;uch a Tran&s;ition, than this unhappy Wretch. He continued &s;ome few Minutes after this, wringing his Hands, as much as the Cords would give him Leave, and calling upon God for Chri&s;t's Sake to have Mercy upon him, and receive his departing Soul, when, at the appointed Signal, the Scaffold was &s;truck, and put an End to his Petitions, and all his Preparations for Death.</P>
<P>He was left to die, as might happen, without that A&s;&s;i&s;tance, from either the People or the Executioner, which is u&s;ual; none gave him one friendly Blow to help him out of his Pain, or even &s;o much as pull'd him by his Legs, to ha&s;ten his End. Notwith&s;tanding he was &s;o very ill, yet he died hard, being a long while before he expir'd; and 'twas ob&s;erv'd that &s;everal Parts of him were convul&s;ed&punc; and he was not quite motionle&s;s 'till about eighteen Minutes after he was hung up. This might have mov'd the Compa&s;&s;ion of the Popu|lace upon other Occa&s;ions; but now it on|ly &s;erv'd to put them upon recollecting
<PB N="34" REF="36">
the di&s;proportion between the Time he $word$ and the eighteen Days, in which $word$ had kept the poor Creature in Torment for whom he &s;uffer'd; &s;o that they rather took a Plea&s;ure than otherwi&s;e, in think|ing his Pain was greater than what'scom|mon.</P>
<P>The Smith was ready with the Irons, and accordingly affixed them to his Body before they cut him down; during which Time, the Mob, according to Cu&s;tom, &s;tripp'd his Coat of its Buttons, as far as they could reach, to pre&s;erve as a Memo|rial of him. After which, he was con|veyed down the River, and in the Af|ternoon, was hung in Chains, at the Place we have already mention'd, pur&s;uant to his Sentence. Great Intere&s;t was made, and much Interce&s;&s;ion u&s;ed to prevent this al&s;o; but they proved no more effectual than the former Applications had done. He was a Man that had render'd him&s;elf unde&s;erving of any Favour; and though he might receive Mercy from God, he had no Rea&s;on to expect it from Man: His Hands had been dipp'd in innocent Blood, and to the mo&s;t horrid dete&s;table Degree, a &s;ingle Murder could po&s;&s;ibly produce; &s;o that it mu&s;t have left an in|delible Stain upon the Nation, not to have made an Example of this O$fender, in as
<PB N="35" REF="37">
&s;evere and publick a Manner, as our Laws would allow of; which, to the Ho|nour of tho&s;e in Power, has been done accordingly; and he de&s;ervedly remains a Monument of Ju&s;tice unpity'd, as being one of the wor&s;t of Criminals that ever was &s;o expo&s;ed.</P>
