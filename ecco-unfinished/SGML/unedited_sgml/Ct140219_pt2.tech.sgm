<P>In the North We&s;t Field of this Pari&s;h,

Acres and half Acres of Ground, in|termixed
with the Arable Land of that
<PB N="309" REF="120">
Field, which lye untilled, and to which no
Body lays any Claim. It is probable this
untilled Ground formerly belonged to &s;ome
Chaplain that officiated in this Chapel, and
that the People cared not to meddle with it,
for fear of the Imprecations laid upon the
Invaders of the Church Lands.</P>
<P>The Manor was probably heretofore
far more con&s;iderable than 'tis at pre&s;ent.
For in a Clo&s;e, in the very Heart of the
Town, &s;ome old Foundations are found,

<P>The greate&s;t Curio&s;ity in the&s;e Parts,
I find mentioned by Mr. <HI>John Lowthorp,</HI>
M. A. in his &s;econd Volume of the A|bridgment
of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;acti|ons,</HI>
<PB N="367" REF="178">
pag. 427, 428. communicated to the
<HI>Royal Society</HI> by Dr. <HI>James Brewer,</HI> and
abridged in the following Words. &startq;Near
<HI>Reading,</HI> in <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> for many &s;uc|ceeding
Generations, a continued Bo|dy
of <HI>Oy&s;ter Shells</HI> has been found
through the whole Circumference of
5 or 6 Acres of Ground. The Foun|dation
of the&s;e Shells is a hard rocky
Chalk, and above this Chalk the <HI>Oy&s;ter
Shells</HI> lye in Beds of green Sand, upon a
level, as nigh as can po&s;&s;ibly be jud|ged;
this <HI>Stratum</HI> of green Sand <HI>Oy&s;ter
Shells,</HI> is (as I mea&s;ured) nigh two
Foot deep. Now, immediately above
this Layer, or <HI>Stratum</HI> of green Sand
and <HI>Shells,</HI> is a Bed of a blui&s;h Sort of
Clay, very hard, brittle, and rugged;
they call it a pinny Clay, and is of no
U&s;e. This Bed, or Layer of Clay, I
found to be nigh a Yard deep; and
immediately above it is a <HI>Stratum</HI> of
<HI>Fullers Earth,</HI> which is nigh two Foot
and a half deep; this <HI>Earth</HI> is often
made u&s;e of by our Clothiers: And a|bove
this <HI>Earth</HI> is a Bed, or Layer, of
a clear, fine, white Sand, without the
lea&s;t mixture of any <HI>Earth, Clay,</HI> &amp;c.
which is nigh &s;even Foot deep: Then
immediately above this is a &s;tiff red
Clay, (which is the uppermo&s;t <HI>Stra|tum</HI>)
<PB N="368" REF="179">
of which we make our Tiles.
The depth of this cannot be convenient|ly
taken, it being &s;o high a Hill, on the
top of which hath been, and is dug up,
a little common <HI>Earth,</HI> about two Foot
deep.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have with a Mattock, dug out &s;e|veral
whole <HI>Oy&s;ters,</HI> with both their
<HI>Valves,</HI> or <HI>Shells</HI> lying together, as
<HI>Oy&s;ters,</HI> before opened: In their Cavity
there is got in &s;ome of the foremention|ed
Sand. The&s;e Shells are &s;o very brit|tle,
that in digging for them, one of the
<HI>Valves</HI> will frequently drop from its
Fellow; but 'tis plainly to be &s;een that
they were united together, by placing
the Shell that drops off to its <HI>fellow
Valve,</HI> which exactly corre&s;ponds: But
I dug out &s;everal that were entire; nay,
&s;ome <HI>double Oy&s;ters</HI> with all their <HI>Valves</HI>
united.&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;Altho' during the Time <HI>Dr. Car&s;well</HI>

more con&s;derable and grievous than they

between each Pari&s;h upon account

high in former Times, particularly in
the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Fir&s;t,
when the <HI>Matter</HI> was &s;trictly examin'd
by proper Per&s;ons delegated and &s;worn
for that purpo&s;e, and the I&s;&s;ue of the <HI>In|quiry</HI>
was recorded, and is now extant
among&s;t other old <HI>Evidences</HI> in the
Tower of <HI>London.</HI> It appears from
thence that this <HI>Controver&s;y</HI> was decided
in the Year MCCCXL. being the 14th
Year of that King's Reign; and that one
Cau&s;e of the <HI>Inquiry</HI> was the King's <HI>Se|que&s;tration of &s;ome</HI> of the <HI>Tithes</HI> that be|long'd
to the Pari&s;h of <HI>Bray.</HI> One of the
Per&s;ons impanell'd upon the <HI>Jury</HI> was
<HI>Edmund de Littlefend,</HI> which perhaps
&s;hould be <HI>Edmund de Littlefield, fend</HI> for
<PB N="505" REF="316">
<HI>field</HI> being often us'd in <HI>old Records</HI>
There is a Place call'd <HI>Littlefield,</HI> a <HI>Green</HI>
in which are &s;ome <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> &s;ituated near
a Mile <HI>Southwards</HI> from the Church of
<HI>White Waltham,</HI> from which 'tis not un|likely
the <HI>Family</HI> might be denominated.
The <HI>Jury</HI> gave in Evidence, That the
Pari&s;h of <HI>Bray</HI> began at a Place call'd
<HI>Bodele&s;pole,</HI> which is the &s;ame that is
now nam'd <HI>Ruddle&s;pole.</HI> From thence
it extended it &s;elf to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Wal|ter
de la Hawe,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Wind|&s;or,</HI>
and from thence to a Place call'd in
the <HI>In&s;trument</HI> by the Name of <HI>Ely&s;ter,</HI>
which was the farthe&s;t Limit South|wards.
From thence it &s;tretched it &s;elf
to <HI>Hethrewe,</HI> which was the <HI>Bound</HI>
We&s;tward. Then it went to a Place
(near <HI>Bradenbrugg</HI>) where in <HI>old Time</HI>
&s;tood a certain <HI>Oak.</HI> This was One of
the <HI>Limits</HI> of <HI>Bounds,</HI> and on it they
us'd to cut a <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> Thence it extended
it &s;elf to <HI>Crukes&s;end,</HI> one of the King's
<HI>Vacheryes;</HI> from <HI>Crukesfend</HI> to <HI>Fayrhok,</HI>
from <HI>Fayrhok</HI> to <HI>Wolvelye,</HI> and from
<HI>Wolvelye</HI> to <HI>Maydenhith,</HI> or <HI>Maidenhead,</HI>
In this <HI>Paper</HI> there is nothing that re|lates
to the <HI>Bounds</HI> of <HI>White Waltham</HI>
but <HI>Crukes&s;end, Fayrhok</HI> and <HI>Wolvelye.</HI>
The fir&s;t I take to be the &s;ame Hou&s;e
where Mr. <HI>Hercy</HI> now d welleth at <HI>Haw|thorne,</HI>
<PB N="506" REF="317">
&s;ome di&s;tance <HI>Southward</HI> from
<HI>Red Stone Pond;</HI> in confirmation of
which Opinion Mr. <HI>Hercy</HI> lately told a
certain <HI>Friend</HI> of mine, that it was for|merly,
as appear'd by his <HI>Writings,</HI>
one of the King's <HI>Dary Hou&s;es.</HI> From
this <HI>old Inqui&s;ition</HI> there is &s;ome room
to conjecture that the Pari&s;hioners of
<HI>White Waltham</HI> ought to go in their
<HI>Perambulations</HI> as far as this Hou&s;e, and
perhaps they had formerly a <HI>Refre&s;h|ment</HI>
at it. <HI>Fayrhok</HI> is nothing but the
<HI>great Oak</HI> I have mention'd in the former
<HI>Section:</HI> and <HI>Wolvelye</HI> is what we now
call <HI>Wooley.</HI> The <HI>Saxons</HI> call'd this la&s;t
Place <HI>Pulverleag,</HI> i. e. <HI>A Place of Wolves.</HI>
'Tis not at all improbable that 'twas for|merly
much infe&s;ted with <HI>Wolves,</HI> e&s;pe|cially
if it be confider'd that the <HI>Woods</HI>
were here, as well as in all tho&s;e <HI>Chil|tern</HI>
Parts, far thicker and larger than they
are at pre&s;ent, and were a <HI>Refuge</HI> for
<HI>Robbers</HI> (as well as for <HI>wild Bea&s;ts;</HI>)
which was the rea&s;on that the Manor of
<HI>Flam&s;tede</HI> was given by <HI>Leof&s;tan,</HI> Abbot
of St. <HI>Albans,</HI> to a certain Souldier of
great <HI>Valor</HI> and <HI>Courage</HI> call'd <HI>Tburnoth,</HI>
with this Condition, That he &s;hould in
lieu of it take effectual Methods to have
mo&s;t of the <HI>Woods</HI> cut down, and the
<HI>Robbers</HI> di&s;pers'd, which accordingly
<PB N="507" REF="318">
he carefully and punctually perform'd.
This is related in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to Dr.
<HI>Watt's</HI> Accurate Edition of <HI>Matthew
Paris;</HI> but I do not remember to have
met with it in any other publi&s;h'd Au|thor.
Now as <HI>Crukes&s;end</HI> was a Bound
to <HI>Bray,</HI> &s;o 'tis likely that it deriv'd its
Name from the <HI>large Cro&s;s</HI> that was here
cut formerly to di&s;tingui&s;h and mark

<P>&startq;Sir <HI>Thomas White,</HI> Lord Mayor of
this honourable City, in <HI>Anno</HI> 1554.
and a worthy Brother likewi&s;e of the
Merchant-Taylor's Society, being a
lover of Learning, and an earne&s;t fur|therer
thereof, fir&s;t purcha&s;ed the Hall
<PB N="549" REF="360">
in <HI>Oxenford,</HI> called <HI>Gloce&s;ter-Hall,</HI> for
Scholars and Students, to receive there
the benefit of Learning. But his pri|vate
Thoughts very often &s;oliciting him,
that he &s;hould (in Time) meet with a
Place where two Elms grew, and that
there his further Purpo&s;e &s;hould take
effect. At length he found out the
Place, where (at his own Co&s;t and Ex|pence)
he founded the famous College,
called Saint <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> College, and
where the&s;e two Elms (as I have heard)
are yet &s;tanding, endowing it with &s;uch
liberal Gifts, Lands and Revenues, as
would require too much Time here to
be remembred or &s;et down.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Be&s;ide his Provi&s;ion for Learning in
this worthy Place, he erected other
Schools; as at <HI>Bri&s;tow, Reading,</HI> and
a College at <HI>Higham</HI> Ferries. More, he
gave to the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> the Sum of
Two Thou&s;and Pounds to purcha&s;e
Land, amounting to the yearly Value
of an Hundred and Twenty Pound.
The Mayor and Citizens paying there|fore
yearly an Hundred Pounds, Eight
Hundred Pounds mu&s;t be lent to &s;ixteen
poor Clothiers, Fifty Pounds each Man,
for the &s;pace of Ten Years, &s;ufficient
Security being given by them for the
&s;ame. Afterwards that Eight Hundred
<PB N="550" REF="361">
Pounds was to pa&s;s to other &s;ixteen
poor Clothiers, according to the di&s;cre|tion
of them put in tru&s;t. Two Hun|dred
Pounds be&s;ide was re&s;erved for
provi&s;ion of Corn, and needful Occa&s;i|ons
for the Poor, in the Order and Care
of the Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Then according to his Will, which
remaineth yet to be &s;een, out of this
bountiful Gift to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> the&s;e memo|rable
Branches, and Benevolences, were
(by him&s;elf) devi&s;ed, and thus ordered,
beginning in the Year 1577. and &s;o
thence forward they went on according
to his own direction. Then on the Fea&s;t
of Saint <HI>Bartholomew</HI> was brought to
the Merchant-Taylor's Hall an Hun|dred
and Four Pounds; the Hundred
Pounds to be lent (for ten Years &s;pace)
to Four poor young Men in the City of
<HI>York,</HI> Freemen, and Inhabitants, being
Clothiers; and the Four Pounds over|plus,
to be employed about the Charges
and Pains, that no Man (u&s;ed in the
Bu&s;ine&s;s) might receive di&s;contentment.
Then in 1578. the like Sum was to be
delivered thence to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and &s;o

<P>&startq;This Sum of One Hundred and Four
Pounds, pa&s;&s;ing thus yearly to the fore|named
Places, is delivered &s;till at the
Merchant-Taylor-Hall, and to the good
intended U&s;es of the giver; and that
there might be no breathing while for
&s;o ju&s;t a Steward's Talent, but to have
it &s;till kept in continual Employment
<PB N="552" REF="363">
for the Poor, the &s;ame Order was ap|pointed,
to take beginning again (as
before) at the City of <HI>York,</HI> and &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively
(while the World endureth) to
the Towns beforenamed, in the &s;elf
&s;ame Cour&s;e as it had the Original, with
great care and ob&s;ervance in them, to
whom it belongeth, that the dead may
not be abu&s;ed, nor poor Men's Right in|jured.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But did he thus &s;hut up his Pur&s;e, and
&s;ay to him&s;elf, I have given &s;ufficient?
No, he did ca&s;t his pitying Eye next on
the City of <HI>Coventry,</HI> di&s;tre&s;&s;ed (at that
Time) in great and greivous manner.
What his in&s;tant Benevolence was, he
took it to be but as an Hours Sun-&s;hine
after a whole Day of Storm and Tem|pe&s;t,
although it might yeild &s;ome
Comfort, were the Sea&s;on never &s;o
&s;hort. But to e&s;tabli&s;h a Certainty,
that no di&s;may or doubt &s;hould ever af|ter
be able to remove (even as a worthy
Pyramide erected to perpetuity) he gave
to the City of <HI>Coventry</HI> 1400 Pounds,
therewith to purcha&s;e Lands ri&s;ing to
the annual Value of Seventy Pounds.
Twelve aged poor Inhabitants of that
City were to have (in free Alms) Twen|ty
Four Pounds, each Man Forty Shil|lings
yearly, on the eleventh Day of
<PB N="553" REF="364">
<HI>March,</HI> or within &s;ix Days after. Four
poor young Men al&s;o were to have
Forty Pounds lent them in free Loan,
Ten Pound each Man, and for Nine
Years &s;pace, upon &s;ufficient Security gi|ven.
And their Turns being thus &s;er|ved,
then Four other poor young Men
were to have the like Sums, and for
like Limitation, and &s;o from Nine Years
to Nine Years for ever.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Afterwards it was ordered (in free
Loan) to Two poor Men of the &s;ame
City; and la&s;tly, to One, in which Na|ture
(according to the &s;everal Limitati|ons)
it doth yet, and doubtle&s;s &s;hall for
ever continue. Al&s;o the &s;ame Sum was
appointed to One young Man in <HI>Nor|thampton,</HI>
for Nine Years, in free Loan.
Next, to One in the City of <HI>Leice&s;ter.</HI>
Thirdly, to One in <HI>Nottingham.</HI> Fourth|ly,
to One in <HI>Warwick,</HI> and for the like
Time. Then returning again to <HI>Coven|try,</HI>
for one Year, it repa&s;&s;eth to the &s;aid
Towns again, each after other in like Na|ture,
for ever. And le&s;t his worthy Intent
&s;hould fail in the continuance, he enlar|ged
his fir&s;t Gift to <HI>Coventry</HI> of Fourteen
Hundred Pounds, to Two Thou&s;and,
and Sixty Pounds to be employed, as hath
been remembred; Forty Pounds being
yearly paid out of it to Saint <HI>John Bap|ti&s;t</HI>
<PB N="554" REF="365">
College in <HI>Oxenford,</HI> and Allowances
al&s;o by him&s;elf given in each Place, that
Bonds &s;hould be made without any
Charge to the Receiver.&endq;</P>
<P>A full Account of this Charity, and to
what ill U&s;es it had been put, and how
perverted, we had Rea&s;ons to expect from
a Per&s;on who was engaged in a Hi&s;tory
of the Antiquities of the City of <HI>Coventry,</HI>
to which he promi&s;ed to add a Copy of the
original In&s;trument for &s;ettling and regu|lating
the Di&s;tribution of this mo&s;t bene|ficial
Charity, but the Work, I believe,
incompleat, died with its Author.</P>
